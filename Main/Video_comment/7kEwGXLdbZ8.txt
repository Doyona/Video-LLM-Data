God knows more than we do. He is the Creator of all life. The Creator of the Heavens and the Earth. We are made in His image.  The One who made the Elephants and Flowers, The Oceans and the Mountains; the electric beautiful Skies of our atmosphere above and beyond knows all things! Love yourself the way God loves you 💖💖💖💖
Es buena la canción y el vídeo con lo que transmite. Pero no creo que Cristina sea el ejemplo de mantenerse y ser hermosa/o como se es. Lamentablemente hay que decir que Cristina se ha hecho muchas cirugías para entrar en los cánones de bella y de juventud
I feel like people today need introducing/ reminding of this song. It is iconically ‘beautiful’ !! 💖
Guys there is a quote that summer made in book wonder about this song saying " words cant bring you down you are beautiful in every single way no matter what they say" in book wonder
I just discover this 2022 version...making me crying as i'm not doing very well
A great update on a timeless, perfect song/message.
Je connaissais pas cette version de " Beautiful de 2022 " que Christina aguilera avait fait je viens de la découvrir à l’instant, le clip est vraiment incroyable c’est vraiment à l’air du temps les jeunes sont tellement influencés par ce qu’ils voient dans les réseaux qu’ils veulent à toutes ces stars ou influenceurs. Je suis contente de cette ré édition du clip c’est très important cela m’a tellement touché que j’en ai eu les larmes aux yeux .
🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 happy coming out day
I didn't need to cry today, but here I am!
Wow. Christina... I need that.. wait I think every  young person needs this
I really love its lyrics ❤
I love how she used children for this and more than one sex. It happens to both genders. And it always starts at an early age. She couldn’t have brought this message across any better.❤
Alejen a sus hijos de los celulares y tablets cuanto antes. Esto se está volviendo un desastre.
It's better to die as who you are than live as someone you're not.
All I can say about this version of the music video is extremely powerful and really hit hard. I think the original music video is beautiful, but this version is powerful.  As the video was going on and on I saw myself in a lot of this video we all have insecurities and we all just wanna fit in but social media has ruined people self-esteem.  Unfortunately because of social media and bullying and trying to look like the models many young kids boys/girls women/men commit suicide because of social media.  I pray people can watch this and see themselves in it and know that they’re gonna be just fine because I know I turned out just fine even though I still have some insecurities I know that I am beautiful in every single way ❤😊❤
Chorrei horrores quando lançou e agora 20 anos depois chorando océano
I love this song
Eu amei mais sem comparação ao clipe oficial ❤
Gracias Linda Perry por tan hermosa composición que ha trascendido hasta ahora. Larga vida para ella❤
i'm 14 and this is so deep, ahh video.
I have been under depression for many years, somehow this year I want to start doing things to help me, I think I do matter and so I do also think God sent me to this world to be a leader and help others.
A verdade é que eu ñ quero que ninguém saiba nada d mi etc... d cm eu quero como eu so feliz 2025 am?

I dont see another comments about this yet but..  What i got from the kid whose looking at the shaving razor and his scenes   Seems likea softer way of inpying he was having self harm or suiciddal thoughts, the next scene it shows him in hes surrounded by pills and in the end it shows someone embracing him.   I took this as he was a teenager with mental health issues contemplating ending his life or hurting himsef, prescriptions were pushed onto him and he seemed unsure about them, but in the end while someone seemed to care about him and his wellbeing  (ofc someone comforting you isnt a cureall, but it definitely makes a difference)
Needed this
Christina, I again really enjoy this 2nd version from you, 20 years later from 2002. And 3 years and almost 5 years later in the beginning of August this year in 2025. It's so beautiful and moving again, not just the title and theme. Way to go for you in a great way, again!
Don't look at me Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is? You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side 'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
Christina Aguilera eres una AMENAZA para el sistema del tecnofeudalismo y para las nuevas generaciones que nunca van a tener buen gusto ni amor propio. Por eso ya nunca vas a volver a ser famosa. Te amo y fui a verte al Tecate emblema ❤
I remember watching this as a kid and it hit hard. I showed my niece who was 11 at the time this video ❤️
so few positive songs
Yet again, Christina demonstrates her unwavering commitment to her art, and to the humanity of her fans. Breathtaking message and video, delivered in a way that only she can pull off. Infinite respect.
Cette chanson est juste toujours sublime. ❤️💙
Cette chanson est juste toujours sublime. ❤️💙
2025 ❤
This was one of the best things I’ve seen in a long time
Singers are very insecure, thats why they get surgeries, fillers etc. This all go against this song and being confident.
🫵👌❤️💯🫶
😮🥺❤😭🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️
懐かしい、、、 現代風に進化してる、、、
This needs to be one of those videos with at least a quarter of a billion views.
But she kind of contradicts herself: Her song conveys the message that everyone is beautiful just the way they are -  without cosmetic surgery, diets, pills, etc. (as you can see some pills in this video). Yet she apparently uses Ozempic to lose weight, which can be very risky if you don’t have diabetes and had cosmetic surgeries.. but I still love her and her songs
Maggio 2025
Maggio 😊
I make a Podcast from the Song in school,😂
I love this song, i used to, like in this song, i used to really be ashamed of my body, like i dont like how i look, because of social media and what people thinks of me
anyone here 2025
Who Is Here Listening In 1st May 2025 ?
This is soooo important. I love the message of this song and I love it even more after seeing this remake. Thank you for your beautiful art, Christina <3
Christina you are such an inspiration to all because your music has inspired and impacted everyone in this world to make them feel good about themselves and to listen to this particular song has hit the ranks off on the charts back then and it should be head to everyone who has experienced with their own issues in our own lives and we all should love ourselves to feel younger selves to not let other people bring us down because we all derive a brith right to feel good in the in and outside of who we all are as people
2025
Wrong. Attractiveness is objective. Anyone who says otherwise is ugly themselves.
❤❤❤❤❤
2025
Wo ist das original Video von damals?😏
Original video much better)
This song is a hit, and as someone said in the comments, it still hits hard. For years, I have suffered from panic attacks, low self steem because of my grandma and my mom critics about my body, my weight, my likes or the way I dress. But now, I am 30 and I am stronger than ever. This song and my friends support have helped me a lot. So there is a lesson we have to learn, WE ARE BEAUTIFUL NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY 💪🏻❤
La mejor voz de los últimos años. Sin autotune sin adornos. Una mujer increíble.❤
2025 and I sobbed 😢
As a Christina fan, this is actually and FACTUALLY, a terribly edited and composed video.

FACTS: Men can't be women, men can't get pregnant, men can't have periods, men can't chest feed, men don't need to be in women's' sports, women's restrooms nor other women's privates spaces, & there's only two genders. Only liberal lunatics believe these fantasies & push them on society; that's why they lost.  Be yourself, BUT stop forcing your delusions on people & attacking them for not giving into your delusions. I WON'T read hate comments.
The message was great in 2002 and it's even greater in 2025!!!
A timelessly song, which  has been wonderfully adapted to today's times. ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
so the little girl is insecure of her small chest ....but that is a kid and the women on the posters had silicons
It's scary how everything on the internet these days is so tied to beauty. If there's a discussion on X, people start talking about appearance instead of the attitude of those involved.Like, "It doesn't matter if he killed a lady, at least he's handsome." Kids are increasingly concerned with ridiculous aspects of appearance that aren't even a problem.If it continues like this, the future will be of identical people without differences.

Buteafial voice🎉
Ironico que cristina que se hizo varios arreglos en la cara, cante un tema como este jajajaja
esta canción no es demasiado, esta canción es suficiente, esta canción lo es todo… i love this song !!!
2:07 anitta pornitta
Amazing video, song too. Natural beuaty is always beautiful and this is win for life. Thank You very much to release this masterpice; this deserves BILLION VIEWS for every generation! ❤
2025??👀
Im here 2025. Crying like a person with a fucking soul! I love you all. I'm a straight and depressed man. This song gets men singing at work, so fucking awesome!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
From anti-#lookism "I am beautiful no matter what they say" pop star idol to poster girl for "#UndetectableEra" plastic surgery.  It's the same capitalist industrial complex  puppetteering a semblance of 'antagonistic' images (products) while cashing in on both - with one hand up an anti-#BeautyIndustry puppet selling you records and the other hand up a #BeautyRegime puppet selling you body image insecurities and the corresponding beauty & style products and services.   It's utterly vile.
2025 Christina reminds us to keep accepting and loving each other despite whatever Mr. President has to say about LGTBI+ community
<3
2025!❤
Gorgeous ❤ what song?
2025 anyone?
This is an excellent of God's children really all people because god does not make a mistake we're all beautiful amen thank youchristina
Watching in 2025 and Xtina got a face lift and
2025 anyone?
THIS WAS ALREADY 2 YEARS AGO??
2025 🎉
Never forget you are beautiful no matter what they say with or without plastic surgery, but when in doubt, do some plastic surgery. can't bring you down.
Practice what you preach girl :/
I am beautiful no matter what u guys say
I'm a little disappointment...the message was so strong and when I went to the website there was nothing about mental health. It was all about her shows and music, and videos. It felt like a cash grab. I can't believe this whole music video was to just get traffic onto her website. This is a little disappointing to me and is an example of the exact issue she brought up. Idk I feel like your contributing to it when you put something out like this and then have it lead you to a website where there she's all glammed up and obviously on ozempic smh :/. She should have put a mental health hotline or something if you ask me. This was all for show it feels like because of that end  false advertisement to get traffic onto her website. But if you want to "find out more resources" you will not find it at the website they advertise 🤷‍♀️. Done with my rant
Gracias por esta canción  Christina 💞💞💞💖💖💖💖
When I was a kid, This song made me know more Christina. Yess, I needed it at that time.
Not me watching this on my dad s phone and crying- this song is indeed beautiful
I like how they are back to how childhood should be
este video deberia ser obligatorio en todas las escuelas del mundo......soy padre de dos varones y se los hago ver a diario....que no se olviden que sos muy hermosos ambos......
You can not bring me down today, I'm so powerfull
This is beautiful video you made me cry in happy tears
No one can save me if I really in trouble lol😑
2024 NOV
Everyone is beautiful in their own way. Don't let society tell you anything else that is negative to your ears. And it's a good time to pass this song on to the next generation.
i hate me
Why do I always cry because of this song)))))
2024 where young girls think they have to look like Ice Spice, Nikki Minaj and Cardi B to look attractive makes this song soo much more relevant than 20 years ago. Social Media is making this generation go backwards!!! Thank you Christina!! This message is needed more than it ever was!❤️
I am your fourth cousin your moms cousin daughter daughter
THIS SONG IS SO MEANINGFUL
Still my favorite song, but um, where are the other races, why only why white kids? anyway ! the song!!!!! the song made me cry again!
I need this music video more than ever because I’ve been feeling like I’m not enough and this music video made me realize that I’m always and I’m beautiful who I am
Now more than ever, a song we need...and a song we deserve.
None of you understand what they are showing you here they are showing you how young boys and girls are turning themselves into the opposite sex wake up sheep or stfu
This is the first time I’ve listened. Actually listened to this album. It’s amazing.
❤️
Crying 😭
In Germany we say : du bist wunderbar egal was irgendwer sagt ❤❤❤❤❤
Anyone 2024
God bless you too amen amen 😊😊
Song good, video stupid my opinion
❤️❤️❤️👣
Im fucking ugly... :( Its true. But I can't change it, so fck it!
This Song saved so much lives. About 1.860.000.000 lives.  Thanks for this Song, Gods with you!❤
You’re beautiful just the way you are. Don’t get plastic surgery, don’t take pills, don’t even try makeup because even if you did that you would still be beautiful and would still be the same.
❤
Das ist so wahr. Ich bin so froh, dass wenigstens eine Sängerin nicht nur über Party, Liebe und Fun singt. 😢
This song makes me feel good
This so makes me feel good 👍
Footprints people. GOD is always with you. That is all you need. Love yourself like GOD LOVES YOU. GOD MADE YOU. YOU ARE PERFECT TO HIM. YOU NEED TO BELIEVE IT. LISTEN TO GOD. NOT PEOPLE AND YOU WILL HAVE A BEAUTIFUL LIFE.
Still listening to this gem in 2024. Christina’s voice always pulls my heartstrings 🥹💗
정말 너무 좋은 노래!!
20244🎉🎉🎉

This song is so beautiful. Chistina has the most beautiful soul. I feel her! I see her! She is an inspiration to the human race. Her songs have touched me like no other singer. Her songs will heal so many people. When GOD put her on this earth he broke the mold. She has been through so much trauma and has lived to tell HER truth. I hope people can learn to love themselves like GOD loves them. GOD makes no mistakes. To GOD people are beautiful in every way. They need to believe it. Mistakes are part of life. Mistakes should bring you closer TO GOD. People can be so evil and cruel. I hope people can rise above all the hate in the world. GOD doesn't know words, he just sees actions. We are in scary times where people are not only getting bullied at school, but social media has taken bullying to a scary place, where more people are killing themselves over stupid WORDS. WORDS are killing people which is so sad and unbelievable. I hope people learn this. STICKS AND STONES MAY BREAK MY BONES, BUT WORDS DON'T HURT ME. People that bully online or in person are miserable fucking people that have no soul and are fucking ugly people. Don't waste your pretty on them. THEY ARE NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR ENERGY. THANK YOU NEXT.
Beautiful
A masterpiece.
SI ALGUNA VEZ LOS HICE SENTIR MAL O LOS JUZGUE MAL...... PUES NO LA CAGUEN PARA LA OTRA POR FAVOR, PARA QUE NO LOS VUELVA A JUZGAR CON TODO EL DESPRECIO DE MI ODIO 😂😂😂😂
ESTA CANCIÓN SIEMPRE TOCA MI ALMA PUES ME DOY CUENTA QUE SOY MÁS IMPORTANTE QUE LO SUPERFICIAL 😢🥺😔
Beautiful song❤
Thank you for exposed the industry of moda
She sings that while having cosmetic surgeries herself behind her.
Crazy to see this after all the surgery
¡Qué cantante!❤
Tth😅Thanks lo my beautiful ladey your friend loves you sweetheart I love you honey I with you would have married me I cannot bring you down just bild you up honey ❤
Deuteronomy 22: 5 "The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man,  neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God...."
Things will never change as long as we as a society hold on to Eurocentric beauty standards, which includes fatphobia and healthism. Know that.
How crazy is that the world moved in 1 year from speaking up against the IRGC and now they're supporting it's proxies against Israel basically serving it's interest against the Iranian people as well. #FREEIRAN wake up world, the west is NOW!
"Words cant bring me down..."yes cause your a B and worst a Narc.😅 B tryna hard to be relatable bye...
È bella quest canzone,Christina Aguilera❤.Fai un altro video è un altro film per favore❤❤❤❤😘
I don’t know how I made it to the end without crying 😭
👏👏👏
Thank you chrustina, this is very important messenge to kids, be yourself
This song is really powerful. Sadly I also believe none of the people in this video were really acting as we all, some way or another, have felt like we were not beautiful, so the expressions are real.
But it’s Not newly recordet just the Video is New wtf 😂
❤❤❤
Muchísimas gracias, Christina, por esta nueva versión del vídeo; era necesaria. No hay una sola vez que escuche esta maravillosa canción y no se me pongan los pelos de punta… 💘GRACIAS 💘
That's Entertainment  Judy Garland  🎤🌐🔥 "A clown with his pants falling down Or the dance that's a dream of romance Or the scene where the villain is mean. That's entertainment! The lights on the lady in tights Or he bride with the guy by her side Or the ball where she gives it her all. That's entertainment! The plot can be hot, simply teeming with sex A gay divorcee who is after her ex It could be Oedipus Rex Where a chap kills his father and causes lots of bother. The clerk who is thrown out of work By the boss who is thrown for a loss By the skirt who is doing him dirt The world is a stage; the stage is a world of entertainment! It might be a fight like you see on the screen A swain getting slain for the love of a queen Some great Shakespearean scene Where a ghost and a prince meet, and everyone ends in mincemeat. The guy who was waving the flag That began with the mystical hand Hip hooray! The American way The world is a stage; the stage is a world of entertainment!" 🌹 Judy Garland
rtc inspired me to listen to this and i have absolutely no regrets
My thoughts and heart and eyes tell me I’m... not desirable..
1:56 when I want to eat
Do you need this song for no reason it’s so stupid
Ariana is better
Now I get it why Noel Gruber sang it once, ironically
Seeking validation from strangers… Stay strong, kids.  The thing in your hand is not the answer.
I like the 2002 version better, it was one of the few representations of the LGTBQ+ community
WE ARE BEAUTIFUL ❤
Wow I'm so happy to see this being rereleased!! And to show it up to date is awesome
What name is song?
lol she doesn't know what to sing anymore so they re-release an old banger to fill the gap
I'm working on this song in singing lessons right now. It was my first choice. I definitely don't have her chops. But I have my own way of singing it. I think I sound just fine.
This is one of the hardest songs ever to sing being in E flat minor . Aguilera is the queen in this key signature, a time classic with so much depth and meaning to many that can relate and pull them out from what we going through . written by Linda Perry  . A true masterpiece
Wonderfull this version of the video! I love it! Our child are just kids! so they must live them life like a kids! Thanks Christina!
💔❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
Adoro Christina Aguilera, mas honestamente essa nova versão do clip dessa Música não condiz com a realidade dela. Gente ela é "toda trabalhada"....😮
Ending... Dear God?
Who’s here in 2024🫶🏼
this song is so additve i can listen to it all day on repete
Nostalgia
I'm beautiful, yes I'm!
This song will always be relevant and useful, which is a good thing because everybody, regardless of age (I remember the original video featured mostly adults, and this one centers on the self-esteem issues in kids) needs it...but that's also heartbreaking to me to me because EVERYONE WILL ALWAYS NEED IT
Can I give double like or a triple  ... 👍🏻 ...   I'm from 89 and I'm really worried about this generation ...  Luckily for me ... I discovered in Orkut times ... ALL OF THE SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE INTERNET IS A ILLUSION WORLD ...  Only works because they take what you like and made ADS ... And the people always showing lies ... And pretending to have a perfect life...  TURN IT OFF THE CELL PHONE  OPEN YOUR EYES ... THE BEST THING ON LIFE IS A FILLING ... CANNOT BE RECORDED OR PHOTOGRAPHED ...
¡Perfecto!
Sadly this is far from reality.
You’re no monster you’re beautiful
I still cry when  hear that people I love feel that pain of the words and  pain I go through every day
This song makes me cry inside. I feel this song reminds me. I am beautiful.
This song never gets old! Even now in 2024, as a young 21 year old college student I still break out in tears and start bawling EVERY SINGLE TIME I hear this song! This song is also the reason I have gotten through so many hard times too!
The BEST
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ kamu lah si cantik itu
This is still a great song in 2024

It's painful when it's your loved ones or family❤😢
20 YEARS LATER IS THIS SONG A ABSOLUTI HIT
It was a very smart and important move to produce a new music video for this classic considering how much harm social media has been doing with its unrealistic ideals of beauty especially to kids and young adults for the past 12 years or so not to mention all those superficial influencers.  And I say that as someone who grew up with social media like Facebook as a young adult as well as being on YouTube since the early days.
We love   you  the way you  are
0:34 and those useless celebrities you adore will 'claim' to love you. People who can't even carry a line or note. Mtschewww.
Lei è una artista con la A maiuscola la adoro ❤  Bellissimo video che ci dovrebbero fare riflettere realmente
The asian girl on vid us killing it
Anyone in July 2024
This song hits so hard especially while being a teen I was very insecure I was dancer and worried about that always looking at my body and pointing out things and this song made me realize that how truly beautiful I am and how beautiful everyone and everything is
❤boyfriends❤❤❤prayers!?❤
Prayers❤❤❤❤❤❤
Am I beautiful because I don’t think that the people think of other people
I love that the little kids are wearing actual little kid clothes in the end, instead of tight revealing s€xual clothes like miniature Instagram models.
Amazing ❤
I love melanie martinez❤
I wish Christina herself appeared at the end of the video.
Is it a coincidence that Eminem and Christina have a song with the same name?  Obviously eminems song is better ❤
This song is so so powerful 😢
COOk🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
Me quedo con el primer video.
Someone should make a cover of this on the bagpipes. Iykyk
Holy shit, the truth of the problem 2024!... but I do miss some diabeld ones, those are beautifull too!
Mdrr trop nul😂
I'm from Canada and one of my coworkers from Taco Bell died in a freak rollercoaster accident during his school's fall faire. We catered his funeral for free, and made a meal named after him. This song was played on the bagpipes for him because he said he loved this song. Fly high Noel. You will be missed :(
Grandma 🙎‍♀️🫁😍
THIS IS FOR EVERY GENERATION UNTIL THE END OF TIME!!!
May there be one less person who would call a woman "degraded" just because she is grow up. May the discrimination against the appearance of Asians disappear.  When I travel to Europe and the United States, many people make a gesture of pulling my eyes with both hands to make me squint intentionally. Is it really that funny to look at Asians? I am tired of the affectionate smiles.
😢😢😢😢
When an artist's creativity and talent are united with the desire to help others and make the world a better place...
Fuerte y honesta canción sobre la aceptación de uno mismo 🎉🎉🎉
Oh my god. I'm a 47 year old man who remembers how beautiful and powerful this song was the first time around. I'm now a father of 3 and have only just discovered this version of the video. I take medication every day for my own mental health issues and this video has just made me sob. It's incredible, and beautiful, and powerful, and oh so real. Amazing x

Amazing and powerful song.
I'm not beautiful
Greatest song of all time

Christina, I sincerely hope you keep this song alive, and when its time for you to retire, you give it to someone who can give people the justice in the song in their time that you give us in our time. Don't let this song die. It's one of a kind, it's timeless and fits any Era you put it in.
This song makes me cry every time. It's so real.
I’m sobbing
❤ both ver
Take c are of you eh ❤
Anoooooooo
Почему тифаль и би
Tkx 4 sharin 😊❤️
This song should be realeased every year
I love the ending children being children.
As someone who is plus sized, I’ve been told I’m unattractive and I’m ugly, but after this, I won’t take their crap anymore. I am working on myself slowly but surely.
Take care of you eh ❤
Beautiful
Beautiful ❤
This so needed to be re-released for this era. I remember when I first saw this back in 2002 & was moved to tears just like when I saw Unpretty by TLC. We are beautiful in every single way ❤ ❤ ❤
omg she has the same name Christina
Can’t believe I still cry on this
esta cancion me identifica tanto me hace sentir tan en paz
Ahgilce
Ahgilce 🎉🎉🎉
😢😢😢
Sad that she doesn’t apply what she sings about..with all the modifications she’s made to her image it’s kind of hypocritical 🤷🏻‍♂️
Jesus! I got goosebumps i had to put on a sweater 💔oh our poor babies have so much pressure💔
my eyes filled with tears when i saw the girl taking of the makup and showing the acne spots, so relatable.
Fuck the iphone adv
Now play it on the bagpipes
Time capsule. What were you doing 20 years ago? Me? I was performing this song. 😊😊😊.  I'm glad I became a woman that my teenage self would be proud of, look up to and who she could come to because back then she needed HELP.
Words can't bring you down but you can bring a tree truck down 😂😂😂😅😅😅
First time watching the music video
Its a strong song.
This made me cry.❤ This message is beautiful and can definitely inspire young kids. You don’t need makeup to be beautiful, you are beautiful the way you are and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.
Let kids be kids again❤
It’s 2024, and the trans woman writing this comment needed to hear this song. 💚
Sempre gostei dessa música, mas nunca tinha percebido que ela era uma crítica social tão tremenda. 😧😧😧👏
This Is A BEAUTIFUL GOOD SONG. We Love Our Loved Ones They're Beautiful TO Them IN Every Single Way We Love Them All The Way We Love Them For Who They Are We Love Them Because They’re GOOD  and We Know They Will Always Be Their Great Loved One. WE Love Them NO Matter What FOREVER AND ALWAYS. OUR LOVED ONES WILL ALWAYS LOVE EACHOTHER FOREVER AND ALWAYS. Our LOVES Ones Are ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL. She Sang It Beautifully. Very Good Beautiful Love Song. ❤️👍🙂
Thank you Christina
Cute video
my mom showed me this ...
The smartphone has destroyed our humanity. It has become a shackle, with us as its slave.
Song for my daughter….you are always beautiful. Don’t let anyone bring you down…….
Música linda demais cara 🇧🇷
hello Christine, was this video re done for a new single release.  wishing you well.
hello , Aguilera was the voice and mini body herself.  and the song back in 2002 was sang with pants suit and hat on stool about her mother.  then she had a kid with her dancer choreographer.
I. Th
Ela deveria aparecer no vídeo.❤
This song really helps i used to feel insecure about myself but now today i already know that im beautiful no matter what people says. Its m'y body not theirs so i dont need to change for them. Thank u.
Everything will be okay Just not today You are gonna be alright Just not tonight
The boy watching the buff guy lift the weights instead of lifting his own weights shows how media’s portrayal of fit people or glowing up has become a form of entertainment for many people rather than motivation. Watching others achieve our goals before we start striving to achieve them for ourselves :,)

this video is so different from the original...
Amooooo
Que vídeo magnífico! Essa música é uma ode a autoestima. Todos, sem exceção, TODOS são belíssimos, do seu próprio jeito, porque são criados pelas mãos de Deus. Ele deu a cada um uma beleza particular.
in the end i can see a blood in phone
My favorite Christina song ever.
Thank You, Christina !!  Again!..
Parents please, some children are too young for smartphones
💜💜
❤️💜❤️
Heard it, learned it, lived by it. ❤
I am beautiful

Todos nós nascemos diferentes, cada um de nós carrega uma beleza única, pode até nem ser visível exteriormente como queriamos, mas o mais importante é o interior da pessoa. Estar feliz por termos ao nosso lado gente que nos admira, nos ama e nos quer ver bem. Quem comanda a vida é o coração, e não a perfeição de uma imagem inexistente em nós. Sejam felizes 🙏❤️
Im a nurse who works with teens who go through eating disorders, self-harm, body image this video exactly explains it.
Ufff yo por qué veo este grandioso video hasta ahora.
Moulin rouugeee
❤ An unknown man from an urban legend once said: You don't need bigger b**bs, but a better books. ❤When the lips stopped being drawn and lipsticked, they moved on to aestetic surgery. Let's go back to the pencil!
Thank you Linda Perry...for your heartfelt song
Toda vez que ouço essa musica choro....
The message at the ending of this music video is 100% of what is going on with todays society 💔
i love this song my mom plays it every day to tell us we are enough
thanks to Linda Perry  from 4 non blondes, for this amazing song!
Pienso que esta musica es universal y debio ser incluido toda las razas de la humanidad.Soy ese que salio en tu primer video tu si que eres hermosa nos concentramos en otro amor y nos olvidamos del amor propio.
OMG the whole time I was afraid that they had changed some part of that wonderful musical masterpiece that is Beautiful.  The video is magnificent, as good or better than the original. Congratulations!!!
Great song great arist😊
Hahaha they want to add inclusion to everything, it's disgusting, it's serious
00:24 this hit me hard as a black girl. Even since I was a kid, all we had to look up too were artists that looked like us , were people taking their clothes off. That effected me as a kid and still as an adult.
Ooofta. This one hit hard because it is so true. We all deserve better! Thank you, Christina, for turning the light back on!
Tá eu aqui, refletindo como o tempo tá passando, o fim chegando… uma tristeza sem fim e chorando com essa música como sempre 😢🥺
May OUR UNIQUE CREATOR Accepts your truthful words and works
2023 has been a hella year. So glad this version has a focus on our kiddos. Life is a marathon, not a sprint. Pace yourself and know what can cause pain now, won't even touch you later. You are loved and supported. It starts with you... Heal that heart. It loves you. ❤️‍🩹
👍❤️💜💚🧡💙💛💖💝
Everyone remember, you are beautiful just the way you are
Let’s kids be kids
I am learning this song on the piano and I really like it 😊❤
And Christina actually had breast implants too.
Wow! Thanks Christina! Message couldn't be more perfect.
❤❤❤ I like this song.
Listening on her Birthday!. Happy Birthday Queen
más va la sociedad a la destrucción, lo que narra el video lo demuestra.
2:34
I live for this song nomatter how old I get.
Wonderful 💙🥺😭
this song will always be in my heart ❤
My theme song
Coming from the same artist promoting hollywood body images throughout all her career to young generations and monetizing his perfect body image. She should have included teens watching her video on tv in this video as well. Wolves playing sheeps now. Nice turn, Christina.  But always, go with the money.
Yesssss!
This song will allways have a good message ❤️
❤
this shows that being beautiful is not always healthy
Timing is everything!! Check mate on this one for Christina and all the children around the world!! There is no better time than now to re-release the song than when she did!! Bravo Christina
Thank you CHRISTINA this was so needed this song is timeless because of the issues everyone faces in the past ,present, and future it will always be relevant to body , mental,and  physical  issues how the young people of today experience so much thru a phone screen technology can be a blessing and a curse
I mean I don't understand why people are so hung on about being "Attractive" who gives a shit?
I do it. I didin over thinking.💔❤
It makes me sad that this song is needed so much more now than it was when it was released 21 years ago. Somehow this version seems darker and more depressing than the original, I guess it’s indicative of the time we’re living in 😢💔
I think the old music video honestly did a much better job of conveying the message, and is still incredibly relevant to the current society.
2023 still around
what a powerful video and beautiful song from Linda Perry... sad fact is that World is worse each and every day.
😢
Thank you for the message!!
in 2002 no social networks which created so much low self esteem
Types of beauty; genetic you do not choose. Cosmetic which is how you modify your genetic appearance temporarily with outfits or makeup. Functional; exercise that makes you healthier and more able to do any desired paid or unpaid labors, a functional change to the body but will also almost always make you look healthier and make you look more capable. So the last is two desirable traits from exercise; health and capability of work...neither is beauty per se, but do make a person more desirable anyway. More esoteric beauty is the personality; it is wonderful to see someone almost give up...but they pause a moment and call on more reserves, and keep trying + succeed in something wonderful from that extra effort. So this is not beauty of a physical sort, but the sort of 'root for the person struggling, and be happy when they succeed' IE this really has nothing to do with species or genetics but more empathy and visceral happiness at others success. Is that too abstract for you to call beauty? Well for me it still applies. Similarly appreciating other personality traits that I personally like, makes an already cosmetically attractive person more likable and desirable. The opposite applies too; multiple people very attractive physically...I want nothing to do with because I dislike their personality. There are more examples; someone posing in stillness can be pretty from their deliberate pose even if they are so so in cosmetic appearance...IE it is the pose that is the pretty part not their body. Or an unattractive person, can be a beautiful person when dancing because how they dance is wonderful. Actions and choices thus increase or decrease overall attractiveness.
buaaa que genialidad haber recreado este famoso tema de ella y haberlo plasmado a la actualidad, enhorabuena <3
to think that some of those kids were not even born when the original song came out...oh the way time flies
🇵🇸🇮🇱🇵🇸🇮🇱🇵🇸🇮🇱 we need peace for Israel and Palestine ☮️
I loooooooooooove this song!
Beautiful message... 😘Xtina!
❤❤❤
Unfortunately, nothing has changed!! Young girls acting like grown women. Young boys stuck in front of their phones or computer screens.. Nice song..
Let kids be kids❣
ok
Una Reflexion echa Poesia
Love the original one too, grew up with it and having an anorexic lil sis and gay friends i do cry hard but in a good way 😢❤❤❤
It breaks my heart to see the gen z kids going through this 💔 I absolutely adore this new edit cos at the end you see them climbing trees and playing around like kids should  and so much respect to Christina for raising awareness for this mental health epidemic ❤😢❤ Respect
Good .
What do the Girls
This song is strong and only a strong singer like Christina can embody this anthem.
Eminem abi yle çok yakışırsın
Legit question, why are the girls wearing blue latex underwear from 0:59-1:05? Is that supposed to represent the pressure that social media puts on girls to "dress sexy" when they are too young? Or does it represent the pressure for young people to copy an influencer's style and clothes without expressing their own individuality?  I have a feeling that it's both.
Spectacular version too :^) Blessings . . . .
I can’t believe I was 12 when this came out. It still hits just as hard if not harder
I loved this song. It got me thru a lot of hard times.
And I'm watching this just as the current just eat advert is shown on the TV. Double standards Ms Aguilera 🤔
❤️
I can;t se ]\\     my ribs arent visible
L take
Just saw the first one for the first time.  Damn.  So proud of you christina!!
Hits differently, watching this 20 yrs later as a parent.
This song was childhood I love xtina forever will she's an icon, she's a legend and she is the moment 😍😍😍
This song is needed more now than it was when it was recorded originally 😢
I’m glad I found this song as teenager… I am beautiful no matter what they say… 🔥❤️🔥
she literally said "put down those damned phones and go to the park" XD she's literaly auntie Christina now
Love this! Get the kids outside playing instead of electronics constantly. Social media should be for adults!
Cringe lyrics.
Para una rubia, bonita y que tuvo todas las puertas abiertas siempre, afirmar lo que dice esta canción es muy fácil.
fart vomb!
The older Version is Better
I miss being a child. I was oblivious to Internet culture. I was innocent. I was good. I was myself. I hope I can stay a child forever. This song resonates.
Freaking nostalgia
me gusta mas la versión anterior
mind it! ❤
Christina, I love you for this. I searched for the song because I was thinking that today more people should listen to the lyrics carefully. This piece is amazing, and will never get old
I am praying for Silvana Lunna today from Argentina. Pass away angel. You are without pain there.
i love this!
We are beautiful 🫶
😢😢😢😢 bravo Christina aguilera bravo 👏
Thank you..for continuing to bring a voice to hopelessness. I love you Christina 💓 It matters. It's actually the only thing that matters . Love each other
Sometimes I try to commit suicide because of the ugliness of this world and how some people do not appreciate my presence in this life and when they do not understand my feelings and thoughts, but when I listen to this song I stop and all those thoughts go away and I enjoy its melody. Thank you Christina Aguilera I love you ❤ It's better than drugs
❤❤❤ me encanto 😢😢😢
Oh the irony 😂😂😂
Beautiful message
Love the rerelease! 😭
Christina, even though you're not in this music video, and I love the 2002 version better, I really love this song by you always. This song is always very beautiful and moving to me. You go, girl!
Oh shoot I had no idea there was a rerelease….
This video somehow makes me more sad  than the original. Social media does have its positives, but there are many more negatives imo. It’s made the mental health issues young people have due to body image and stuff 10 times worse than it was 20 years ago before social media.
より多く持つことよりも より少なく望む事を常に 選べ　ちっぽけな快楽ほど 人間を小さくさせるものはない 少しの欠点も見せない人間も 　馬鹿か　偽善者である。
OMG! this video is like 8 billion times better, and gives it a muuch more powerful and universal meaning. just wow..
Simplemente hermoso 👌
Versión muy necesaria por lo corrosiva que son las redes sociales y los altos estándares de bellezas actuales.
I wish the girls at my school knew that they dont need makeup. They need to slow down.
I love the song, singer and the message of the video. Your skinny, fat, dark etc. Everyone is beautiful 😘❤
We still need this song.  I was in college when I heard it for the first time...and now when I look at my own kids.  Thank you
*CHRISTINA AGULIERA*  *THANKYOU BIG TIME*  *UPDATED VIDEO GENIUS*  *THIS VIDEO COULD BE FEATURED AS A SUBJECT OF DISCUSSION AND EVEN STUDY IN SCHOOLS EVERYWHERE*  *THANKYOU TO YOU CHRISTINA FOR YOU AS AN ARTIST AND HERE AS HUMAN WITH EYES  ON YOUTH OF THIS WORLD*  *THIS UPDATED VIDEO IS INDEED FOR ALL HUMANS WORLDWIDE WHO ARE NOW BEING TEMPTED AND TAUGHT SELF HATRED THRU THE TOO COMMON DISEASE OF SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS*   *PLATFORMS WHO SADLY ARE CHOOSING TO BECOME  VISUAL  PSYCHOLOGIAL SPIRITUAL AND INDEED MORAL CYANIDE FOR THIS GENERATION OF YOUNG HUMANS FROM ONE YEAR OLD TO FORTY*  *WISE MESSAGES FOR HUMANS UNDER SEIGE DUE TO THE PITFALLS OF TECH WHO HOLD US HOSTAGE*  *TECH HOLDS BOTH PROMISE AND PERIL*  *ASK THE PARENTS TEACHERS DOCTORS  SOCIOLOGISTS AND OF COURSE THE YOUTH THEMSELVES*  *IT HAS BEEN CALLED AN INTERNATIONAL CRISIS IN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH*  *SO WHO CAN HELP*  *CHRISTINA FOR ONE*   *BLESS YOU* 🌍❤️🌏❤️🌎❤️🌍❤️🌏❤️🌎
I wish I knew about this song long ago….cause my self esteem has been destroyed and now I got childhood trauma that is lasting to adult hood rn……. I thought I needed to do more to get accepted….😢at least that”s what my parents keep saying….
this made me cry so beautiful<3
I will always love this song, such a masterpiece.
YES WE ARE!
What’s this song it sounds so great!!!
Still a beautiful song, but hard to take the so-called artist seriously given how she has visually portrayed herself over the years with an image of "sex sells" and she was recently at a pride concert sporting a strap-on penis. I support every lifestyle but this woman is just cashing in on any trend she can. You can educate and inform the world more with powerful words, life examples and common sense more than you can with shock value. Low class....
I love you.
Thank you so much for this! I've loved this song since day 0 as I still do and I think the message is more important than ever. Thank you
Her voice is really a gift from God.
👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
lol south koreans can't relate.
This is the most important video remake! 😢
This is just beautiful
Beautiful
❤❤❤❤❤
One image I wish there was would be the before and after images hugging each other. But this is truly a masterpiece about what "adults" want their kids to be like. Never lose your hope, small things in life will quide you.
É a beleza padrão que esta geração está sendo massacrada, pela mídia... Pula da admiração para a obsessão, infelizmente.
I heard 'Ave Maria' at the memorial. A little miffed at the end when he said, "And in italian as well...."  LIke she wouldn't be capable. I bet he can't put hospital corners on my beds.  How would I know, but would I be surprised so much to say out loud.... "OH MY, he knows how."   I was on the other side of the screen Mouseketeers. Incredible wasn't the word then. Phenomenol doesn't fit now. Perfection needs a new definition.  Thank you for sharing an amazing talent then.  I know how much work it takes to keep getting better.  Thank you so much more for continuing to be astonishing.
Love you Tina , your beautiful picture will always hang on my wall with your sweet voice gal❤❤❤❤😂

CLASSIC!!!! Relevant in 2002, STILL relevant today, and only God knows what the pressures of body image is gonna look like in 2043. I remember buying the is album from the Virgin store in Times Square!!!!
Powerful song, never gets old
Right on. I sent a letter to you when you first released this song, and I thanked you for it. Here we are all these years later and I am thanking you for it again. The video is, once again, perfect for our times.  Thank you for sharing your music and your talent with us.  ♥ Major
Nice Christina.😊
I get the idea of releasing this song, but in my humble opinion, the other videoclips were more powerful to me. The things shown on those clips, still happen nowadays.
#beautiful will always be a life’s anthem
wow this is so powerful.
my biggest flex is my cousin is in that video
*she should’ve re-recorded it also*
Artwashing apartheid Israel hurts Palestinians. If you wouldn't have played in apartheid South Africa, why apartheid Israel? Thousands of artists have respected the Palestinian call and refused to cross the picket line. #XtinaDontGo
❤
So beautiful! Love. G.
Christina Aguilera a love you
this having so few views is so sad
The only thing that would make this video better: If it was revealed near the end that all the kids were in some way connected to the main people featured (the anorexic boy and girl, the gay couple, the addict, etc.) in the original video, showing that they did make it through the toughest of times and accepted that they are in fact enough and are beautiful too.
This song is like wine🤌
Gods Children are Not for Sale!!
Idk how to explain this. I have a lot to slay on how magical this is. Thanks for sharing  I love you
Please don’t play for Apartheid Isr@el. The struggle for JUSTICE in Palestine needs ALL of us to do the right thing. 🇵🇸
Una canción atemporal merecía este vídeo, me encantó. Gracias Xtina.
❤
Fight against bullies #wearebeautiful
Redpill Is the only solution
We needed this
I was surprised to see a recreation of this video-clip, and seriously, this song fits even better nowadays. I just started clapping right at the beggining and ended up crying. congrats for all the team that produced this. this is art. this is inspiring. that makes me feel even more motivated to work on my job and make something good about it. thank you. thank you so much!
I'm glad she didn't make it political and ruin the beauty of the message.
This song makes me cry and remembered that nothing has changed, I was 12 when this song was released and I was starting to have TCA . I am better now but I am still feeling insecure , I hope to be happy some day
qué genial que esta canción lanzará una versión acorde a los tiempos actuales, seguimos hundiendo a las nuevas generaciones :(
WOW!  Love, love, love Christina and listen to all her songs on repeat, but this is the first time I've seen this video! Absolutely Empowering!!
Wonderful video! Thank you for it! ❤
Excellent ❤ love this music  the letter is so actually
Jesus bless everyone reading this ❤
Sempre 🎉
This video is so good, it makes me feel very emotional, just like the first version 😢 thank you Christina for bring #Beautiful back.
i dont get is tho????
I'm not sure if it's a measure of just how good this song was/is, or a sad indictment of society, that this song is even MORE relevent now than when it was recorded...   Maybe a bit of both?    Also, Xtina's vocals on this album were, and are, absolute 🔥
christina sweety bring me some instrumentals an i swear to god i will incredible lyrics in no time
Bumped into Christina in New York! She was so sweet and stopped for a picture ❤ Thank you Christina
Anybody can tell me was is "Stripped" mentioned at the end of the video? Thanks in advance.
20 years ago when i heard this song, i cried for myself, remind myself to be strong. Now i cried for this generation. They have a harder time to cope with mental health wellbeing than our generation did. Stay close to your children and keep them safe and loved.
That's the beauty of music, it transcends time.
I miss papa franku
Wow still wonderful.
Que la niñez sea niñez! ❤
This is a special Song, Great Memories ❤️🤍💙
😢
Love this!❤
Everyone in this video are gorgeous.
I didn't need to watch it.  🤔👏👏👏❤️🙏🥳🥰
original was 1000 times better
very powerful
Wooow. No cabe duda que Chris es un artista de verdad. Esta versión es tan real que dan ganas de llorar.
Bullies go scotch free for taunting you verbally, emotionally and online but will act as a victim as soon as you speak up for yourself. Speak up, remain calm and never stoop to their level because they are only looking for a reaction to make them look good and make you look bad to others. For the sake of your mental health, remain calm and never react to their insults. Ask them why they are being mean to you and watch them flip the coin on you because they are good at recruiting followers to join their crew by telling fibs that make them the victim.
Necesitaba mucho escuchar estas palabras, adoro la canción!
I just watched her on Nightline and they interviewed her on site at Stonewall and they played this song. OMG! She ate this song. So beautiful.
Beautiful (Don't look at me)  Every day is so wonderful, then suddenly It's hard to breathe Now and then, I get insecure From all the pain, I'm so ashamed  I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  To all your friends, you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?  You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh, no 'Cause you are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  No matter what we do (no matter what we do) No matter what we say (no matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (yeah, yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes  And everywhere we go (and everywhere we go) And tomorrow (the Sun will always shine) The Sun will always (we might wake on the other side) Always shine  'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  Oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, oh Don't you bring me down today
You Muse Speaking the Soul Song of our Times!
Just beautiful!! Stunning! 👏👏👏👏💙
La amo.
Wow this video is even harder hitting than the original 😮
人は苦しむために産まれたんじゃない
If it really were a song, that could really be respectable and without any additional criticism, here in this song would be all the people, black people, white people, brunette people, mulatto people, Fat people, short people, people with some type of disabled, transgender people, homosexual people, lesbians in the same way, children in the same way, fat children in the same way etc etc etc ..... This song at first glance seems to be excluding the rest, you can even put a an ugly woman who puts on makeup for more is still ugly, basically the song talks about your personality, the song makes you understand that if you really are ugly, you have to love yourself;  because otherwise no one else will.
The previous song is better since it is the original, nothing to do with the 2022 song 😔
Great song I like this version of the video much better it still gets the point across without all the gay tongue down the throat
Danggg ur writing exactly what I went on to write about probably just like everyone else this song even 20 more then 40 more than add 30 more yearsss and this song will stillll have sooo much meaning annnnnd hit sooooo many hearts and help soooo many adults and teenagers and preteens and whateverrrr ages 😢😊 it will hit home as the saying goes or cut deep...or 😮 hit u to the core.... Point is it's the ONLYYYY song that I believe is actually TIMELESS 😢....   THANK YOUU CHRISTIANA AGULARA  U HELPED ME AND SOOOO MANY OTHERS AND IM NOT JUST SAYING THAT IM SAYING THAT FROM HAVING BEEN IN A PACK WITH A FEWWW FRIENDS who were in middle school about to end our last year and go off into highschool and we all just couldn't 😮😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢 find the confidence and or strength we felt to keep going on yes seemed a bit dramatic buttttt as some know back thennnn bulling was a lot worse and not as many no bulling clubs and nooo bulling friendly and unfortunately alot of kids took their own lives do to being bullied picked on  one boy or guy friend didn't get  to in time and sadly hung himself in his closet for kids bulling him and calling him gay Faget hitting him and qwir so many horrible things and girls got it to soooo a group of girls had a horrrrrrible yet sadddd pact and do to us singing ur song at the top of our LUUNGSSS everyday together and if one of us didn't come by after school to sing we would allllll go ride our bikes or brothers bikes over to there house and find them crying in. There closet or bathroom or basement and we would always bring our pink or w.e little boom box radios and CDs back then and belt that songggg out sooo loud 😮😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😊😊😂😂 and eventually that girl would smile and say like OMGGGG I CAN'T BELIEVE I WAS GOING TO....😮 ...AND WE'D JUST ALLL STOP EM AND JUST TELL EM DONT BE EMBARRASSED WE ALLLLLL HAVE HAD OUR BAD DAY OR TWO OR MORE THATS Y WE HAVE CHRISTINA 😂😂😂😂 SO THANKKKUone more thing I know it's just a music video and all but the boy looking at the razor I started crying uncontrollably remembering HIM... And the girl putting fake boobs inside their shirt and I could keep going but obviously I've said soooo much in soooo glad im grown up and not in middle and high school anymore but these kids hide sooooo much that we sometimes forget they might be bidding or going threw........😮😮😢😢😢😢this video should be shown in schools all over the beginning of everyday just to remind
And somehow this version hits me harder than the original video. Only thing that's not really addressed that should be included in the video is the LGBTQ aspect that was part of the original. Especially with all of the attacks on LGBTQ, and especially trans, kids. From sports bans, to gender affirming care, to who can use what bathrooms and locker rooms
This is so annoying cause all this kids still fit the beauty standard in some way why not actually put people that dont fit the beauty standard thank u next.
Add the trans 'fad' to this, and voila !
I never liked the song and for sure Christina Aguilera. But the Clip is very true and hits directly the spot of today's problem with our media drunk society.
LOVE AND RESPECT ALWAYS🌹 one love to you🌻
She's an Awesome singer. One of a kind.
Decolonize
this was amazing
Aauch😢😭♥️
This video is brilliant, so sad and tragic. This is truly what our youth are facing daily!
JESUS ays that everyone of us is precious❣️❣️❣️🙏
Great Song 😁🤗💪🎶💜💜🙏🙏🙏Stop Bodyshaming‼️Unconditional Love💕💞❤️
Ícone nunca erra❤

GOD BLESS YOU  NENA.  GREAT MESSAGE. YOUNG WANTING TO BE OLD. N OLD ACTING  YOUNG.  HOD BLESS THE WORLD.  1
Hola estamos en la escuela escuchando esto
This sound is 2003 version,not 2022 version.i really know how her voice
❤️‍🩹😌🌟
love yourself the way you are, because only your opinion matters
Verygood❤ i'm found beautiful
It’s so horrific all those instagram & phone people. You can recognize them by clothing all look the same, all so insecure. All zombies. I feel so sorry for them but they will never understand what really counts in life
Since this is re-release video; Can this go back number 1 on da charts js 😢
For those who are in pain, I would say, you are beautiful, no matter what others say, they will always try to find some flaw in you, even if it doesn't exist
you are beautiful, no matter what people say, you are beautiful in the same way, perfection
I'm glad I didn't grow up with social media, life is tough enough IRL.
Love when Christina  vocalizes..omg..❤❤
We are beautiful..no matter what you say..words wont bring us down..❤❤❤ PS: Kids and teens are mean to one another..especially more now while hidden behind a screen.  Wtf has happened to our children?..Parents gotta wake up...and pay th f@#k attention to whats goin on.. lil girls nboys are bullied daily Some to the point of self mutilation..its terrible and  cruel. You see someone getting bullied..dont worry about those "cool kids" in the back of the bus laughing..Stick up for the weak and afraid kids..make a friend..put your arm around them and say "dont listen to those assholes" They'll all be used up by the time theyre 20..trust me I know.  I was a victim of bullying and I blossomed at 19..peace and love ❤❤..xxx
My name is so similar
Hey..try putting the phone down..or get off that computer..get out of bed..wash up..shave your legs..wash your face and stop feeling bad for yourself.  How can you reach the next level if you wont even brush your teeth?  Dont worry..plug it in..give it a charge..it will be there when you need it. Today I saw about 6 or 7 kids in a circle..each on their phone..not acknowledging the next..in some other place. Try learning how to talk to each other. I talk to my customers..face to face..for 10 hours a day. No phones allowed...think about it..can you go 10 hours without using your phone or tablet?... Thats why the kids in America have diabetes and overweight issues at 12 years old. Go out and play..run ..walk..ANYTHING..Just move your body..Peace and love..❤❤
I think someare missing the point...in the past 20 years .since Social Media..took off..theres more bullying. More self destruction and more teens under 17..getting plastic surgery..than adults. You have to LOVE YOURSELF 1ST..before you can love someone else..xxx ❤❤❤
For those in pain I would say you are amazing and words shouldn't hurt you
something that is admired by everyone You always will be pretty  You're enough
Means self esteem, feelings and something beautiful!! For those who are in pain, I would say you are perfect and don't care about other people's comments or compare yourself :)
Something pretty
Para mi siempre será la mejor cantando, y lo que falta para q vuelva hacer tendencia como a sus inicios, es hacer un Reguetón con Karol g 🔥🔥👌
Together with “The miseducation of Lauryn Hill” this was an album is that changed my life. As I get older the meaning still changes and this number has especially meaning for me. When I finally fled from home I was searching for unconditional love and meaning in “I am beautiful”. It’s been 21 years but still not given up and ever closer to finding an answer. Hopefully you are to. You are loved.
Wow!!! That is so important
20 years ago I became a mum for the first time at 18. Named my first born Xtina. I've always loved this song. My ex made me feel terrible about myself the first 4 years of my daughters life. I threw him out, met my now fiance and every day for the past 15 years, he tells me I'm beautiful and sexy. I've had 6 children with him and feel pretty good with myself now and my body. ❤
I’m so happy I’m in it!!! ❤❤❤
Lindo, delicado e extremamente necessário,como tudo o que Aguilera faz... Obrigado por por dar voz às inúmeras belezas  existentes! 💛🗣️
for the new generations❤
Para nuestras nuevas generaciones ❤
Congrats on winning a Webby award for this video Xtina! Its deserves all the praise! Just seen on Twitter last night a kid killed himself. If you go to his profile you can tell he was "screaming" for help! But all he had was trolls and snap chat AI's that he was talking to, per his profile updates. Social media isn't the answer. Get real help or talk to real people. So sad.
LOVE YOURSELF:                  Stop comparing yourself to others. ...  Don't worry about others' opinions. ...  Allow yourself to make mistakes. ...  Remember your value doesn't lie in how your body looks. ...  Don't be afraid to let go of toxic people. ...  Process your fears. ...  Trust yourself to make good decisions for yourself.
As a 16 year old I can say I don't think I've ever felt beautiful. What I can say is that every day I for sure compare myself to someone. Every day my mind attacks me by saying I'm not enough and I'm hopeless just because I can't design or change myself. This video and the lyrics describe me so well, and now that I think about it, it's dumb that I think nonesense about myself because I'm beautiful in my own way
Merci pour ce clip.  Ne sacrifions plus nos enfants aux écrans et à la perversion des réseaux sociaux, pour une économie de quelques adultes cupides. Offrons leur la vraie vie connectée : celle avec la Nature et les autres.
i can identify
we are always bombarded with ads for makeup, skincare, weight loss and stuff like that. and they still wonder why we hate ourselves
thank you so much for your music
been listening to Christina since i was in 6th grade. love
As soon as this song ended it was a commercial for burning fat quick... 🙄
Congratulations🎉🎉🎉
Webby Awards
Xtina ❤ eres una leyenda viviente ❤
am i stupid, or does this song sounds exactly like "I'll Try" from Jonatha Brooke - Peter Pan 2?? and both songs came out in 2002
Who else is hearing this music in 2023
Just I needed this today. Yesterday my boyfriend told me that I am not as perfect as the girls he watches on TikTok and Insta But I am beautiful and you that you are reading this too. Never let anyone make doubt yourself
Still a hymn to listen to!
❤️❤️❤️
Always remember that You are loved! ♥️
Well, this is better than that gay one 🤦🏻‍♂️
😂😂😂😂
Ich ❤ deine Songs
Thank God I grew up in a time we were kids playing outside... fun games, fun times, no social media dictating beauty, and no people fighting about who was right or wrong. At least where I live people were friendlier and you knew your neighbors and played with their kids.
I remember watching this video on VH1 forever ago. I've never felt a song so much in my life. And then I saw me in the video. I wouldn't be here if not for the representation I felt because of this video and others like it. "Why that character gotta be trans/gay/ect?" When no one talks about things like this it doesn't keep it from happening. It just makes those people grow up feeling like something it wrong with them. And that kind of isolation can be life threatening. -Jessie he/she/they
Kids won’t get rid of their iPhones tho…
Eu não sou de idolatrar nenhuma pessoa, nenhum artista, etc, mas a Christina é diferenciada, é uma mulher que admiro muito, além de gata e inteligente rs
10대에는 멜로디가 좋았는데, 30대에는 가사에 울고 있네요.
Jessah
Aguilera te amo
just letting everybody know YOU AR!!! BEAUTIFUL!♡!!!!!!❤❤❤🎉😊  and letting you know that it doesn't matter what colour what gender you ar!!  ENY THING!! YOU AR BEAUTIFUL!!! I LOVE Y♡U!! ALL!!!
Christina sweety this is my new account this is your friend felipe if you wana get moe work done just let  know
This literally break my heart 😢
WOW what a gorgeous video with such a TIMELESS song and Artist!
bellísimo
When I was a kid, until I was 10 years old, I thought I was the happiest kid on the planet.  I had friends, I got excellent grades, I had great relationships with teachers and with my family. But my school only went up to fourth grade and that was all over, the next year my class broke up and all my happiness and joy turned to ashes in my mouth. I discovered myself homosexual at the age of 11 and at that time it was still a huge taboo. I lost all my childhood friendships, my relatives started to demand traits of a heterosexual man showing interest in sports, which is something I don't like.  I suffered from loneliness as a homosexual from 11 to 18 years old. When I turned 18, I decided to explore the world and try to insert myself into the LGBTQIA+ community and I was only rejected and humiliated for being skinny and out of shape.  Since then, from the age of 18 to the age of 29, the problem in my life has been not being able to adapt to the fitness standard. I feel like my story is the story of the ugly duckling, with no happy ending. I think about suicide daily. This clip made me hopeful to see that subjects like fatphobia, skinnyphobia, aesthetic pressure can save lives and finally put an end to appearance prejudice.
STOPPP one of the girls in the tree has the same leggings as meee!!!!!!!
I think this is even more real all these years later❤
memorys to the stripped tour
Words can bring me down
This video is true people are Beautiful!
I just cry ❤
So POWERFUL! I LOVE this new version. It’s such an amazing video. Christina is an ICON.
This song is really beautiful! And it’s also inspired me thank you so much❤
久しぶりに聴こうとしたら、去年Re-releaseしてたんやね！（しかも20年も経っていたとは！！）  この曲、大好きです！
I love this song so much but I can’t think beautiful about myself.  Haha. Tired of being me.
Words are epic the voice is divine   Xtina is so amazing ❤🎉
REST IN PEACE NOEL GRUBER❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤
Well done!! Be who you are, not what the world wants you to be❤
Very thankful to see someone finally saying it, social media is part of a LOT of problems. What's great about this video is different parts can be interpreted in different ways Like the body builder yelling at the child lifting weights: It could be about body image, or a comment on toxic masculinity, the idea that you have to yell and fight to be a "real man"
I love this song  because it tells us to  all be different and not change  are self
I am just a puddle watching this!
Davide ❤
😂😂😂❤❤❤ Davide loves all thé lovers tous est ok im happy Élodie CREATORS.        No problèmes party in paradise 🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂 et 😂😂😂 et 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉MERCI TO ALL
Beautiful song! 😍😍😍
this is as good as the original music video.
I'm sorry, I'm crying 💔
Did not picture myself crying my eyes out as a mom when this song came out 21 years ago..😭😭😅
Lo siento Christina me gusta mucho tu música pero promocionar el amarnos tal y como somos cuando es claramente evidente que vos te hiciste muchas cirugías plásticas en el rostro para que no se te note el paso del tiempo ni la edad, me parece algo hipócrita
This reminds me of Colbie Callait's poignant song and video "Try".💯 This video version is much better than the original.
Who knows what kind of emotional and s3×ual trauma these child stars go through by the time they are 18. Namely Disney, Nickelodian and all the major TV station / movie associated children such as Xtina, Britney, Justin T., Vanessa Hudgens, Orlando Brown, Raven, Lindsey Lohan, Naya Rivera (RIP), Miley C., Dana Plato (RIP), Kesha, Corey Haim (RIP), Corey Feldman, Drew Barrymore, Aliyah (RIP), the Olson Twins, Demi Lovato, Selena Gomez, Nick Carter, Amanda Bynes, Jody Sweetin and all the numerous young children/adult stars who ended their lives much too soon.💔
❤️❤️❤️
Nice song
im crying, but not TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH OHHHHHHHHHHHH GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD have ANY of you tried a TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE also jess shut my DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Why?   No need to re-realise it
Christina siempre tan empatica recreando la realidad de las cosas en sus videos es simplemente hermoso como ella
Not enough fat people in the video
as if you don't know how easy it is to speak in this song!!!
Very beautiful✨
Love and life have traumatized so many people, myself included. But here we are…..
It's a good one but the problem is that Christina is in no place to stand behind that message, as she's gone all in on the makeup and countless things done to her face. She is essentially that very woman the girl looked up to as she padded her bra.
❤❤❤
The girl with the red hair is so brave
💗💗💗💗💗
Would've been better if christina was in the video
This was so beautiful. I couldn't hold the tears.
I'm excited before I watch the video. Edit....yes..yes..yes..power to the people.
Sufrí bulling acoso escolar desde los 7 años hasta los 17 por ser gay..... Me retiré en mi cuarto toda mi joventud y esta canción me dió la fuerza para no arebatar mi vida con mis mismas manos.... Ahora con 36 años estoy aqui..... Un cuerpo vivo però con el alma en pedazos, mas solo que la una, sin amigos, sin pareja sin familia....  Gracias Cristina!
Wow
Interesting..
no bc why did i almost cry 💀
Ironically not one obviously ugly person is in this video
I know this affects girls more but thanks for including boys/men
:(
Amo esse clip esse video da cristina aguilera amo tenho compaixao

This song and video is a missed opportunity. Everything Christina mentioned in this is tie to capitalism, advertising and male hierarchy, but she didn't go there. So I'm disappointed 😥.
This music video is a much better version
Now I have a very strong urge to go climb a tree but its 22:10 on a cold february night so I'm going to have to wait.
1.33 man changes race
I don’t really like the song but I kinda but not really but at least I subscribed on it
This is for REAL thanks LOVE
... I mean, wouldn't be more effective if they used actual ugly people for it? The people here are the "Hollywood" idea of ugly, actual ugly people are hard to look at them, these people ARE beautiful making it pointless.
Christina Aguilera is one of the singers I loved listening to while growing up in the 90s. This song is very enduring and still relevant as ever 💖
Amo esta canción pero estos niños siguen siendo "hegemónicamente" correctos así que no tiene tanto impacto como debería o como querian o como pudo ser ...me quedo con el video antiguo (ya se q nadie me preguntó , a ustedes tampoco)
<3 :c
I love this song
i almost teared up with this video
Everyone is beautiful❤

I have heard of this song before but listening to this song today transformed my life.  My fiance opened this song for me because I have always struggled with body image due to the trauma experienced from my first boyfriend who used to tell me that "You are perfect - except just one thing. Too bad. You aren't beautiful." Don't ask me why I dated such a guy. Haven't we all been there? Falling in love with someone who didn't deserve you but still managed to be fooled by the blindness of that love...  It has been 9 years since I first heard those toxic words. Yet, I still repeat it to myself and act as though I could never be beautiful. I even doubt other people when they call me beautiful. Are they just providing lip service? Are they saying it just because they are nice? I know it is ridiculous to give so much credibility to such negativity. But sometimes... the mind moves on it own and takes us away from where we deserve to be.  Recently, I have been extremely insecure in the process of choosing wedding dresses. I cried many times fearing that my "non-standard" body wouldn't be able to fit into all these beautiful dresses.   My fiance has been very patient, caring,  and loving throughout all these. He ensures me that I am beautiful as I am. I am beautiful - whether in a wedding dress, casual dress, professional dress, pajamas, or without any clothes. More importantly, I am beautiful as his lover, as my parents' daughter, as my brother's sister, as my close friends' friend... I am beautiful not just because of how I look with certain clothes or without any clothes, but because of who I am in the inside. He opened this song for me, looked into my tear-filled eyes, held me tight as I trembled, and held my hands as I felt weak and insecure.   At that moment, I remember a conversation with my host mother. I once asked her, "How did you come to believe in God?" She said that she read the Bible in college and thought that "Wouldn't it be nice if I can believe in all these?" And just like that - she believed and she continued to believe until today. And that belief has guided her for the better.  Wouldn't it be nice if I can believe in my fiance's sincere gaze, strong embrace, and loving words? Wouldn't it be nice if I can let myself free of the haunting evil spirit telling myself I am not beautiful? Wouldn't it be nice if I can believe in my worth and start telling myself that I am beautiful as I am today?  I want to believe.   And I shall believe.
Made me cry like the first version when it was released.
Insecurity is I…the worst I feel it..😢
Antiga..mas taaaooo atual..😍😍👏👏
Tysm i really needed this
This song absolutely made my day 10x better cuz I was recently bullied for how I looked. This song is going on my favorites
Resumo desses anos
incrível 🥺
But obviously don't be a fatass overweight it's not healthy and don't be a skinny and under eating 🤷‍♂️ but that's fatphobic huh or maybe people wanna help you
Beautiful music video xx
:)
Impactful for me even now that I've grown up. Seeing the kids in dark, cold offices, and then outside, really makes me long for similar conditions as an adult. We need to be more connected to the outdoors and each other.
cryin love this song
it amazing, because the song and video shows that everyone is beautiful, BUT also shows how children's life should look - not caring about looks, but about to have fun and friends
Hey this is the Filthy Frank song 🗿🗿
I like the video clip of this song and it is true that there are girls and boys who believe everything that comes out on the internet.
Yes! Just yes ! I’m a millennial but this is amazing for the next generation it’s needed
What an old song❤️
This video really touched my heart
i'm not crying, you're crying
Watched this video in English and it gave a really good message
I do wish it was more diversity bc this issues affect many ppl all other the world and all ages. I wish it also showed a lil more context.
1:39 she looks like the girl who played young Cassie in euphoria
Powerful, a video that needs to be seen.  Well done Christina.
20 años y la canción no deja de sentirse!
I love this song so much!🥲
This really relates to life
:[
beautiful message of this video and the song, i hope everything gets better soon. society sucks
That one little reminds mo of the viral dance sport girl exuding with confidence 😍💅
I liked the message behind the song ❤️
Wow so powerful, especially the drug part hit me hard… these days people take pills for everything… at parties, when they have to sleep, when they have a test, when they are stressed…. Most of the time we dont need all these mechanic things in our bodies. No plastic and chemicals but fruits, family and a free mind is what we need ♥️♥️♥️   Wow the ending is everything…. Made my emotional heart tear up. Beautiful christina♥️
🥰
The way they did this with beautiful people who probably aren’t even insecure and if they are they shouldn’t be but other than that very good message
I’m beautiful😊🦋💜
stop judging, because if you are, then you are not perfect self
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thank you, Christina for helping  to save our children through art.
Today the Lord told me I'm beautiful no matter what anyone says. I was feeling down and he wanted me to buy myself some chocolates and listen to this song. Jesus, I <3 you.
love the message
im not sobbing you are
Me encanta que ella siga haciendo este tipo de trabajos . Siempre la mejor  I love that she continues to do this type of work. always the best
Always extraordinarily beautiful.  Xoxo
Our kids shouldn't have to feel like they have to grow up or look grown up
💚
The original video packs a very powerful emotional punch, but this one is absolutely fantastic! Although I still prefer the original, the new video delivers an as too important and urgent message as the original. It's such geniality the same music speaks truth to so many problems in world!
Homeless people are wasting time begging for money when they could be volunteering in the community or creating businesses instead.  Let’s change that with the Universal Basic Income. Or by abolishing money.  Let’s give everyone over the age of 13 a guaranteed minimum income of $1,500ish USD/month! !?!?!?
This song make me happy the clip the words thank you 🙏🏻 ❤
Una voz maravillosa.
5900000 Vistas Felicitaciones 👏
Temazo Viva Srta Cristina
Thanx 4 send this message. It’s so important 4 the new generations involved in this maelstrom called social nets that seems to urge bad messages bout 'how our physical tributes & how we had to feel if we are not in the average of “how we are to feel for can’t reach those actual stereotypes based in unreal beauty cannons”  For all those persons that, in a moment of their lives, think look better or worst (physically or mental epoques) under commercial pressures: for all this moments we should to believe and embrace the faith when we are in 'low hours'
Sorry, it's not the song without a gay kiss
I literally just a comment how she needed to do this and she had already done it. Okay queen.
Se o original me emociona até hoje... Esse superou! Hit atemporal ❤️
Its ok to be White
Merci
Remember your beautiful just the way you are 🌟
Cried than cried now.
I LoVED the old version and I love this new one and it is so needed. This songs needs to be spread through out social  media to spread the importance of the song
The ginger kid is in my school. Lol
Don't let Biden tear you apart I built the money and checks books for yall america and appreciate it and others
See I'm not the enemy gotta prove every president will predict war that's why I keep codes. Yall gotta take care of each others
I literally just started crying. Such a strong message. And the music bringing back childhood memories
I'm 43..and crying again with this song. And look at this world where children/people is being judged just because they're unique. They should live a free life. They should be happy and dont have to care how the world judges them.
i have a one year old and this actually made me cry. Thinking about how carefree my youth was and that my son will never experience the same innocence...
Beautiful is different for each person as long as you're healthy try and aim for happy
Amazing! Just amazing
she is a so good person
All I can think of when I hear her name is Christiana  agulera better switch me chairs😂
Woah..
This needs more attention.
this video put our modern day expectations of Beauty into view for me. Sad that the younger generation has been overexposed to sexualization. 10 yr olds wearing makeup and worrying about being pretty/beautiful.   Social media/Main stream media has put so much pressure on how men/woman view their selves relative to others(likes) that it's become toxic.
You are beautiful!
The old version:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAfyFTzZDMM
ชอบภาคน้องไมล์สที่สุดในสไปเดอร์แมน รอภาค2 มาแน่
This video cuts deeper than the original one. I pray the kids watch and learn from this one like I did with the original.
This was always a powerful song with important massages  It is becoming much more relevant with every single day that passes. Every word and image shown is true and we see it every single day, it has become impossible for children to be children. They are surrounded with so many impossible expectations for how to dress and how to look and it's been an issue for a long time! that standard only rises and becomes more extreme with every day.
Yes i am beautiful with my own imperfections ❤️
Bert Dicker in his performance was so good it made me cry. P.S Also your good at climbing a tree
Thank you for remastering this masterpiece!   🫶🏼❤
In 20 years, the song still relevant, but i'm not sure this new music video will have the same impact.  Of course it's updated, but we can see the loss of something. Everything is so empty nowadays. The message is so obvious, that it's  too much. it looks it's not trying to convince people, it's for already convinced people. can we go back 20 years ago, when people where trying to talk to each others ?  even when you're already convinced, you would not watch it over and over again, like in the old days. it's just that.. it's not a 2022 version, it's more a public health message with a Christina Aguilera song.  it's not a music-video anymore.
Oh God. She's so awful. The ugliest voice I've ever heard. You must be deaf to actually like that. She is screaming and straining her voice to sound decent. It’s too harsh. (And mind you.. I’m a voice teacher)
I think it's pertinent to credit Linda Perry with the song writing.
How Powerful is the Song , Incredible … Christina you must appear again in the scenario
*Every
Form
Always
Death of me
Fml
Oh my gosh the beginning of this just made feel like crying and wanting to give all of those people a hug 😭❤‍🩹
Great song, great video, but too bad the singer doesn't apply this message to herself.
Great to see such amazing an song coming back to life! As a person who had a hard childhood and tried sucide age 13 around this first release I hope it helps kids today to
amor eterno por xtina
4:08 sounds
such a simple message but is still very relevant to a lot of us

This may have just saved my life..,
Thanks christina
Hard to believe this song was released 20 years ago. One of the most powerful songs I’ve ever heard
I learned about this song from the ride the cyclone musical.
❤️
why isn’t this trending? what great and thoughtful update. still so relevant in 2022.
Se me puso la piel de gallina... era necesario un video asi Xtina 🥰🥰
Beautifully crafted ❤❤❤❤❤
this world is becoming more and more weirder, has been always weird but now we can see it everything more clear
Out of topic, the boy in 0:28 is very cute. He'll be handsome man someday.  Does somebody know his name?
I just randomly found this video, but am very happy I did. It's not often that in a video, I have seen someone wiping the makeup off that covers their acne, which shows how much of an illusion it is that people feel pressured to meet. This video is spreading a very positive and important message on top of what the song already does. I hope there can be more songs and videos like this in the future.
I understood all of there storys exept for the boy with the razor?
Algum brasileiro ouvindo essa relíquia?
Get your kids off social media ASAP
U were so rude to Melanie like tf
Christina aguilera she such Relevant women this video 😂 it's lyrics for life
This song still hits by Christina Aguadilla I like all songs from her ❤️ when I am listen it when I'm bored 😩 when released Christina old or good songs
love this so so so much ❤
love you😭😭😭😭😭
Even tbey are nof in front mirror. Front  fbe tik tok so sad.
It's interesting how she released the song in the 2000s when social media began to rise and now again after it became basically an essential part of everyone's life and even children are now using it.
💕💕💕💕💕
La video es raro, como los de Sía, el mensaje se entiende y está bien pero sinceramente no se compara jamás de los jamases con el del 2000's que es mejor, sinceramente no me gusto el video
This music video is so underrated
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN🇺🇸=CHRISTINA AGUILERA.
Bellissima come sempre .
the weight of social media beauty standards is so crushing.
Thank You! This means more than You know 🥰
I love this song so much its so cute and good I just can't figure out At 2:17 is the guy yelling at the kid or telling him words can't bring him down?
I love you Christina Aguilera, you’re my heroe. You save my life with this song
Lol Christina Aguilera was 100% partially to blame for the unhealthy/unrealistic beauty standards of the 2000s...
Como pode essa música me fazer chorar e refletir todas as vezes que eu a escuto
I think the video while less impactful than the original is absolutely wonderful for the kids
crying now and i’m 64….song is still very relevant 😢❤
Well, quite simply, we must not leave mobile phones with social media applications in the hands of teenagers and children. It would be much simpler and the problem would be solved.
May God have mercy for your souls 🙏🏻 🙏🏻 🙏🏻 🙏🏻
00:59 uh, Christina got breast implants. Lol I thought she was beautiful no matter what they say?
Such powerful melody, lyrics and voice. Idk but all these people look and are beautiful to me.
❤❤❤
Merca no hay transas¿(
WE NEED TO KEEP UP WITH THIS MESSAGE CUZ MEDIA WILL STILL HYPNOTIZE PEOPLE, NO MATTER WHAT
Yeah.....80% men of tinder are swipe left because they not atractive enough for woman ...yeah you are beutiful  no matter what they say but is just empty words.
This song is very suitable for today's era, where we sometimes compare ourselves too much with others, feel that we are not worth it... come on, friends, be your self..  live just once and be grateful for what you have, healthy greetings always for all of us aamiin
Dont take the blue pill... these celebrities did... they destroy their own integrity.
0:28 I know him!!!
BEAUTIFUL means to be yourself. You don't need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself... 🙏
Thank you
Nip/Tuck, the series, comes to mind here.,1:38
Would like to see Maddie Ziegler do her lyrical dancing to this like she did for a lot of Sia's vids.  #Maddiezeigler. #Abbieleedancestudio #lyricaldance
❤
beautiful
Yikes, I got choked up. I’ve been working with kids for the last 19 years and one thing I can say is that there’s nothing better than to see a child smile and laugh. That’s how its suppose to be. Unfortunately, many kids are robbed of their right to being happy. We must protect a child’s happiness❤

Powerful message and links to helpful resources. This is why Christina will always be better than Britney.
Essa música é atemporal e totalmente necessária nos dias de hoje. Emocionante
Life is harder for a man. Thats true. 🙄
A versão de 2002 é insuperável. Muito fraco esse clipe.
just love yourself
I think it’s fascinating that there isn’t a single fat person in this video
This is a beautiful video and song but what I don’t understand is how pretty much every female pop star continues to perpetuate these standards and then will put out/post something like this, as if it exempts them from contributing to the problem for decades.
Y cada vez peor está sociedad... :(
There's nothing you can do. This video could only hit hard just because its unescapeable. Doesnt mean a beer at a bonfire isnt still enjoyable.
Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed  I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today  To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?  You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today  No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes  And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side  'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
sometimes its just so hard to stay in controll when  everybody is telling you your not enough or ur not beautiful but this song helps so much
This song is so much more relevant today not just for girls it's an absolute hell for young boys to who don't meet the standards of beauty.
i absolutely adore this recreation of the original music video. i love how in the end all the children end up doing exactly what they were meant to - just be kids, who can play outside, and live in the moment. not online, not on social media. much love ❤
God, what a positive turn from the original videoclip. Congrats for it, Cristina! There is lot of beauty and right purpose in this one, plus it brings hope for the future of humanity, at least for all those that are and will decisively choose beauty instead of ugliness, love instead of hatred, and TRUTH instead of falsehood. Amen.
Te amo xtina
The most are so young
Bienvenida ☺al Festival de viña 2023
Oh damn. Put this at the other end, I'm 63 and can't believe I'm not a babe anymore - the reflection is an insult. Thank you, you made the kid me cry. But the old me still mourns.Ok, the end? It's been going on way longer. I was raised in ballet and gymnastics, and as a result was an active anorexic for at least two decades. And then my soft child bones were bent and molded beyond normal, so that in my 20s I could not sit through a movie without my knees seizing up. Find me an aisle seat. Now I'm old -ish, I have crippling lumbar osteoarthritis and I'm accused of being drug seeking. Opiods make me vomit so no, keep your addictive stuff and start treating out children as children and let them decide their athletics after their growth plates have closed.
👏👏👏👏🇦🇷🙏
pov la juventud de ahora
Hermoso mensaje ❤
Aint this a Bitch I just saw this video for the first time and noticed that the thick beautiful young sistah with the cornrows is not in the end as being beautiful and accepting her beauty!  Why?
Hit atemporal ❤️
Latterly the the best song ever made!
thank you
15h51🙏🔯💜♾️😇
Ok... Blame social media of everything you want, but that teenagers and children should talk more to his parents. The parents of today are the biggest problem I think...
thank you Aguilera...
The TRUE prison bus.
No way, that’s me
This is relatable
Essa versão é realmente uma realidade da minha geração.. foi no fundo da alma ver a crítica social que essa música carrega sobre a beleza
Que nostalgia
Just crying the whole time while watching this.
This music video will change the world.
Yes I AM it pertains to me  THE FIRST TIME I HEARD IT I  CRYED!  VERY APPROPRIATE FOR TODAY
Yes I am !!
Hermoso video y aún mas vigente que nunca. Con el tiempo hemos visto que las redes sociales han llevado a muchos, incluyendo los niños a reflejarse en la fantasia que se ve en las redes sociales, fotos editadas con photoshop y multiples filtros de moda en modelos e "influencers" para mostrar una falsa realidad. Los niños deben aprovechar esa etapa para jugar, divertirse con otros niños. You are beautiful not matter what they say ❤
This video deserves many likes and views the meaning is soo deep unlike the meaningless songs these days
Great song Cristina feel better time play it
😢😢😢
omg this song really opens my eyes. I hope we can change the world and what society says is pretty because every one should feel beautiful without having to change.
Otra vez, maravillosa ,perfecta
Aquí el único comentario en español 🖐️ siempre me ha gustado esta canción desde 2006 escuchándola
That "SHINE" is still super powerful today!
They want to keep us in the matrix. Get out of the Matrix!
Y donde estan los que se besan????
Stunning and Powerful.
Since what country are you enjoying this masterpiece?
The message is great. Thank you for releasing again.  We are leaving in fake world.
Gina Linetti would approve. Anyone who knows what I'm talking about is a legend
She did not record the voice again  bc currently she is not able to reach the notes.
Uma mulher que sempre se preocupou com a aparência cantando uma música PERFEITA sobre se aceitam e não entrar em padroes
beautiful
15 years ago I sang this song in front of the school I wishh I could get that video so I can post a then and now 🥲💜
this is art
I was in my mothers womb when this song came out. I was an insecure little fetus who was going through a rough time and this song saved me, I needed it. Thank you Christina.
This music video is what we need in the world! not Lil naz x twerking
they rlly played this at noels funeral smh... R.I.P
this is just touching
An important song then and an important song now
I wish this song gets more popular in Korea. So many Koreans suffer from the inconsiderate and ignorant comments on people’s looks, including celebrities. That explains why Korea is known for plastic surgery…
That's cool, yeah: Instead of searching for the ideal body online, go out in the nature playing and having fun and get solid ground on the feet-it's also healthy
I’m crying right now because I can’t understand that I’m beautiful.
I prefer the filthy frank version
can’t believe how emotional this video made me. started crying the most seeing kids be kids, playing outside & climbing trees. that part was truly beautiful.  it breaks my heart seeing children have stress about their bodies like that because of what society has proposed.
Well done . 👍
This is one of the main reasons my babies are not on social media. I never want them to think that they need to change themselves in order for someone else to like them. I feel in this trap and it has taking me years to come out of it. I play this song for my kids and tell them daily how beautiful they are. This is a message that never needs to stop being spread 🤍
someday maybe ill be able to be happy being myself but for now im still in that process
Love you christina thank god for your blessing voice and beautiful lyrics help me so mutch god bless you ❤🙏
1st full song I've memorized before when I was a kid.
❤️
this song's so powerful, it brought me to tears 😭
I’ve never been called beautiful but by this song and my mom. 🥺Incase no one told you lately, you ALL are BEAUTIFUL ❤❤❤❤
Noel only said he liked this song once😭😭😭😭
Endlich mal wieder ein Normales Video ❤ trank you Christina❤
This is amazing but as someone who has done theatre all my life the girl who took of theatre makeup didn’t really do anything plus you can where makeup if you want to
Just remember most people who you perceive as being perfect look pretty normal in person and often use loads of photoshop because they’re insecure. Look at the Kardashians never showing their real skin, cellulite, or even their own faces w/out makeup.
Where is the original video??
It so good for right now. Say louder girl! Cheers
YEEEEESSS
❤❤❤❤❤
Nieśmiertelna piosenka  nieśmiertelny tekst zawsze aktualne
And then those children turn 30. Unfortunate that beautiful is still concidered young in media.
This goes out to those in the LGBT COMMUNITY shot and killed in Colorado the stabbing in idaho and on the Transgender day of remembrance 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🙏🏾🕯️
Who tf really…be watching them shits?
what is stripped ?
this should get a vma
This music video was absolutely beautiful
These kids singing that they are beautiful hit different... 'cause they all are. They all are conventionally beautiful. There are a lot of kids that don't fall into that category. Their struggle is a real one. People do judge the book by the cover and some people would never know what it's like to be treated with kindness from strangers, just because they don't fit our idea of "normal" and "beautiful". It's like these days that mould gets narrower and narrower... And even though that song's meaning is beautiful and powerful, we all have seen Christina struggle and try to conform too.
Epocas donde la musica era buena y se requeria talento... Muy aplicable para hoy dia esta cancion. En lugar de avanzar, estamos cada vez peor.
Creating this video, including those kids in it, is some very disturbing thing.

We always get lost and need to be reminded💜
Don't look at me Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?

This song made me cry when I was 12, and now it’s making me cry at 32. Fuck, this is powerful man
boring
I remember when this song came out I was 14 years old I had low self esteem and depression I heard this song and it made me cry. 20 years later this song people still can relate to especially this younger generation.   It's sad we have to go on social media to seek validation if we are pretty enough or good enough. Social Media can be a killer mentally. I'm a mom of a pre teen and it broke my heart when he told me that kids call him names and that he has depression.
let the kids be kids and enjoy their youth and innocence without the constraints of todays standards.
My stance on the whole trans thing: these children today are lacking healthy social circles to feel accepted in, good role models, and people close to them that are trusting so that they can talk out their struggles. Adolescence is a tough time for everyone, developing body changes are scary. When parents are not there to be real with their children about the reality of these changes, it can make for a much tougher time on their kids.   The way someone acts, or the clothes they wear, their hairstyle or their hobbies, or any other personality traits, does not correlate with their sex. Sex and gender identity are mutually exclusive.  Youth today should understand that the key to freedom of identity expression is to challenge old societal stereotypes/definitions of what a girl or boy ought to look and act like. Girls ought to be free to be tomboys, while it having nothing to do with being any less of a girl; and vice versa for boys. They can FEEL and ACT and LOOK any way they so choose, without it correlating to a problem with their natural body. Liking things that society labels as traditionally "for men" should never mean that there is something wrong with a woman. How you feel, or your mental state, have nothing to do with your physical body.  Stemming from that, if you have a mental issue, messing with your physical body or taking health destroying hormones to try and change it, will never help with the mental issues you've been having. If anything, going through body augmentation will leave most youth frustrated because it wasn't the solution to their problems. The solution is to speak to genuinely understanding people or a therapist, work through your demons, and tell off society's stupid stereotypes about gender identity.
Thank you for making this song, Christina Aguilera 💖
And still not a single plus sized person! How?
Esta canción la amo desde su primer versión, es increíble todo lo que puede llegar a transmitir. Te amo Reyna saludos desde México.
This is a message to everyone ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Too bad this video wasn't released 10 years ago. Now its time to undo the damage social media has done!
Fantastic video. Could have linked straight to the mental health services instead of her own website though.
Sempre attuale

Evet burdan anladıgımız ,çocuklarınızı bırakın ne b*k yerse yesin. Gelecegimiz tümden mahf olsun
Thank you Xtina
Fact: I know words can't bring me down but that  hurts me!
I usually don't listen to her but this song is amazing and I can relate a lot. That's exactly what I wish for the kids to live and enjoy themselve.
고등학생때 많은 위로를 받았어요.먼지 같은 인생을 살고 있다고 떠도는 먼지따위가 엉겨붙은 인간이라 아무도 날 사랑하지 않을거라 생각하며 하루하루 나를 파괴하며 지냈는데 이 노래를 들으면서 많이 울고 생각하고 털어보려 노력했었어요 십년이 지난 지금도 크게 바뀌진 않았지만 패배감과 무기력 만큼은 많이 사라졌어요 그대를 만난다면 꼭 고맙다고 얘기 하고 싶었어요 내 과거는 아프고 슬펐지만 그대의 기억만큼은 용기로 가득했어요 고맙습니다 언제나 그대를 응원합니다.
Bad video klip
Good timing, Christina ❤
We are here now, and we can change.
Timeless song
Love the song, the original hits me a lot more than this one
Very powerful message with this clip!
Sort of feels like a Gap/Old Navy commercial at the end, but I love it! I love that they show kids being kids again outside in nature, where they belong instead of in front of a screen!
boring af.
I love that this has been remade and represents so many kids (and adults) today but what about people with disabilities? Still not represented. I absolutely love that this video brings to light issues of today, but it still doesn't represent all areas of society. Still love this song and still love Xtina!
Our whole lives were told we’re not enough so someone somewhere can sell us shit.
Goosebumps. This helped me get through a tough time as a kid. Hate that this message is needed even more now for the youth with the rise in social media appearances
♡
I felt this
I love this, I’ve always loved this song but the message is so very applicable to this generation, I hope this is seen and heard by everyone who needs to see and hear this!
The kids going from worrying about how they look to playing outside is so…wow. Has it gotten to the point where prepubescent children are worried about shallow things like this more than actually playing outside ?
🥹 THIS MADE ME CRY ! It hits harder now because of the times we’re in … this is definitely needed . Thank You to Christina 💕✨
What's sad is how little has changed in 20 years. Same human rights issues and worse going on. Unfortunately they are bringing me down these days. Wish this song could still be empowering for me like it used to...but it kind of just makes me sad. I really thought these kids would be living in a different world...technology aside... it's all the same BS and excuses for hate.
A reminder that this song was recorded on the first run. Then they mixed and layered it but the main part of the song was recorded on first try. Also, this video should be redone every 20 years and this message will never get old.
one day Around 2022, nov 18.. yeah  21 years ago was release BEAUTIFUL..
WOOOOOOWWWW!!! Thank you so much for this
The message is great and all, but what about not choosing conventionally attractive people to represent body insecurity issues. It just defeats the whole purpose. Can we start normalizing normal?
didn't thought i'd cry today. beautiful and powerful. abraços from Brasil.
I love this song and don't get me wrong, it is a great message but its rich coming from an artist that is part of the problem
a cada década uma scars to your beautiful diferente
Wow, this will be perfect for #Riptwitter 🎉
I like how everyone agrees with this but no one ever actually takes action to make the change.
Woah dude. This song still hits just the same..
The part that touched me the most was when they got off the screens and went outside to actually LIVE and be children- That's what the world should look like.
This hit hard - so beautiful
20 years ago this song gave me a lump in my throat. Today, I’m in tears. Here’s to all of you beautiful people, including Cristina and Linda Perry, and to everyone struggling to accept their own beauty - especially the young people. ❤
I love this song and its message so much BUT it is so sad, that the one who wanted to share it, doesn't seem to believe in IT herself. I was so shocked to see how such a beautiful woman like Christina has done so much surgery to her face that every smile and laughter seems like every other emotion 😭
I find it it ironic that she redid this song - and used this imagery…but…she has work done.
Beautiful.
Don’t you bring me down.  Todayyyyyyyy
About time a video like this came out! Beautiful! Made me cry
DAMN
Súper mensaje 😢
I literally just rewatched the glee episode where Amber sings this in season 1, and it cut deep because I’ve always felt ugly and sometimes I still struggle w finding my own beauty. Shows like Glee and songs like this, help people really feel seen and heard.
Cuando las personas sienten sus ruidos internos, no acuden a ellos mism@s a interiorizarse, encontrarse muy por el contrario se vuelven ansiosos codependientes del CONSUMISMO, emalteciendo a las industrias, drogas (priorizando a la insalubridad mental), acudiendo a las drogas y hay drogas terribles cómo el cristal y minimizando su humanidad. Y esto no es religioso, ni espiritual, ni de culto, es una realidad de lo que está sucediendo actualmente.
I wish she would have redone the music and vocals, to match the newness of the video and show the growth and changes in her voice.
Just as powerful it was in 2002 just as powerful 2022 🙌#christinaaguilera
How sad is society now?  You are either too thin, too fat, too old, too young, not pretty or handsome enough. I would hate to be young again..😪
This video Is disgusting, the message Is contradicting, and guess what, your video Is on social media 🤯 like everything else.
🖤
Not them using beautiful ppl in the video 💀
❤❤❤❤
Easy for christina aguilera to say. Hard to say that "Im beautiful" as someone whos not a billionaire living in a mansion and can barely afford to pay rent.
Thank you Christina for this video
So great to see acne represented in this as well, and the moment when she looks at herself removing her makeup
this is fucking heartbreaking
What perfect timing. Thanks for doing this Christina.
Classic
What can I say bar about bloody time.
This. Song never fails to maake me cry
I'm nearly 30 and this song still makes me cry
Get your kids off social media!!!  Better yet, get yourself off social media, and use it as little as possible!
Let children be children !!!!
yaaaaaaaaasssssssssssss
This video is so heavy...
This song and her whole record *stripped* saved alot of lives back then.
My guilty pleasure.  That may sound nuts, but I'm a Mod and an indie fan...and mid 50s. 😁
I like how both versions of the music video focus on very different groups, the first music video focuses on a wide range like homosexuals, people with E.D, goths, alopecia etc etc while this one focuses on the youth along with their insecurities and problems
gracias por salvarme siempre, desde mi adolescencia hasta en este nuevo comienzo de mis 30. Abrazo de oso enorme !
I’m in a very negative mind frame and the end seems like peace after you’ve unalived yourself. Can someone explain what the end really means? Cuz I know that not it, but that’s where my brain went 😞
This made me cry
Es ist so unfassbar passend zur heutigen Welt.
I was 5 years old when I exited this song
Love the video 😢❤
Wow...
So ein starkes Video musste einfach weinen 😢
Tik Tok do your thang!!!!!!
I love you Christina.❤️
You forgot to include the parents who do this to their kids because of the parents ego.  But sure blame technology and not the adults who use it to hurt others. 🙄
❤️
How many cosmetics procedures does Christina has ?  U can’t sing and say love yourself as u are, but then have multiple cosmetics procedures cuz u don’t think you are beautiful as you are.
When I was little I use to get severely bullied for how I looked and when I’d come home crying my mom would play this song for me and it would make feel better. Because of this song and many of her other songs I will always admire and respect Christina Aguilera.
I feel so bad for today's society. So much nonsense to deal with. 😔
🖤
thanks Christina
I almost cried
So true
What's beautiful here too is that the ending shows most of the kids outside, just kids being kids not worried about having to conform to society and/or media's toxic standards and expectations. It's honestly really neat and a nice touch!
Please just treat others with kindness and compassion. Even if you can't understand their struggles or think they should be different for some reason - it costs nothing to be kind. Even if you are hurting, tearing others down doesn't help any of us. Try to choose silence if you can't choose kindness. We don't always have to speak and unless someone is asking for your advice or opinion leave them be. Life is too short for us to hurt each other.
大好きな曲
I have no words! Those lyrics are so powerful. Thank you, Christina ❤
Song still makes me cry, every time.
Very well down and powerful video that perfectly depicts body image issues and technology in modern times
On one hand I'm so pleased and grateful for this re-release because of the strong message it can also give to today's youth... But on the other hand I feel so sad and hopeless that 20yrs has passed and the situation isn't only the same but, due to social media, SO MUCH WORSE! Where will we be in another 20yrs....?! The thought horrifies me!!😥😔
So glad they represented boys too! A lot of videos like this don’t include boys, and including them here really makes me feel represented!
esta canción nunca no me hace llorar
THANK YOU
XTINA is Goddess!! This video is so powerful and so true!! Thank you
Watch this video too https://youtu.be/TPdV9C3U0N0
Some parts of this video you can see TLC’s inspired 1999 “Unpretty”  video
I love that she did this because social media can be a good thing but its also toxic. I became obsessed with my size in 2017 i struggled with annorexia nervousa due to the influence of social media pressure by 2019 i was 98 pounds on a feeding tube fighting  for my life in the mirror i saw all my flaws and I couldn’t see past them now im a healthy 160lbs   I find we often don’t realize the pressures of social media
this video was beautifully chilling
I needed this so much today, really.
When the kids went outside, I lost it. 😭 so beautiful and the perfect solution to this toxic world. This song came out when I was a teenager and I loved it. This re-release is even better!
Powerful message.💚💜💛
POWERFUL
2:45 the girl in front right gave me chills 🥺 thank you for bringing that song back Christina
Thought it was powerful before but fuck me! Brought me to tears
Amazing ❤
This song helped me during my teenage life, I am very insecure until now but this song always give me encouragement but I hope this song will never be timely and relevant in the future because we can make the world a beautiful and encouraging place for children and I aspire that in the future we won't be needing this song to encourage us but a reminder that because of this song things became better.
❤
Nice song,but please stop using kids for this stuffs
👑❤️‍🔥👏🏻
Thank you for re-releasing this song. We need this now.
This was the first song I ever learned word for word when I was about 5 when it first came out. I adored this song, 20 years later and I still do!
Love the ending.
Your voice is so beautiful forever
“Suck it up.” “They don’t bully you if you won’t let them.” “That’s part of growing up.” “That hurt will make you stronger.” — Each and every one of us is built different. Those things may help others, or those can make things worse. So instead of saying those things, help them build their self-esteem stronger so they can use it as a foundation, a step that they can get on top of to reach their goals. When you see someone struggling, having self doubt, your help can be as easy as inviting them to listen to this song. The easiest way to learn something is through repetition. A good strategy to teaching a lesson would be something they can repeat over and over again without the feeling of being overworked. Instead of those things earlier,use this song. You might not see immediate changes on how we view ourselves and the world we create, but at least you gave them a different perspective. Because sometimes we think that something ain’t that remarkable until we take a step back and appreciate its beauty. Give them an opportunity to listen to this song, take a step back, and appreciate that beauty that you helped unfold.
It really applies in this new generation
❤ I loved this song when it came out and I love that there is a new version of the clip now, so this generation will also understand the message even better 💛 TU!
Buddy of mine did a metal version of this.. #lyricnoel
This song helped me so much in my teens
Love this song ♥️ love this rerelease
Wow kids being kids! That is genuinely BEAUTIFUL 🥹 This made me tear up. The message at the end is extremely important. 🖤
Wow perfect time to release this song again. 🙌🏾 great job Christina
Thank you Christina. Bless your kind, caring, beautiful soul.
HI GUYS
❤❤
Come through
That is exactly what people need right now. This song after so many years haven't lost its meaning. It hits even more powerful right now.
Honestly, seeing this being re-leased for 2022 felt like it was needed.
The fact that you can hear Andrew Tates voice talking down to women in the beginning is the best to me. He’s such a detriment to this generation
🙏
A moment of honesty,I 100% agree with the message but I dislike that celebrities express this message but on a day by day basis display the exact things that cause pressures and insecurities in humanity just simply by their presentation…Beyoncé did the same thing with pretty hurts, (and I absolutely love her don’t get me wrong) but  how often do we ever get to see these same women in their most natural physical element…😢…Be the change you want to see, don’t just talk about it
Thank you for this update. I was a young woman when the song was released and it meant a lot to me as I was going through an eating disorder and hating myself. Now I'm a mom to a 9 year old girl who hates how she looks. This will help with an important conversation.
La mejor era para rehacer esta canción de verdad, gracias Christina... Ahora vivimos en un diez veces más falso de hace una década
P O W E R F U L
I am crying 😢 I'm so glad she did this.
It’s just so sad the feelings we had when we first heard this still rings true for this generation. 😢 This song truly is an anthem. Brings tears in a new way.
Thank you for doing this. I think the majority of people needs to hear this. Thank you very much. I love this song and I needed to hear it❤❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️🥺🥺🤗🌍❤️❤️🌹🌹
I wish I could play this for my son and make him realize just how beautiful he is, but anxiety and depression is a bitch, even in a nine year old who deserves the world. I wanted kids, but if I had known that I would have put another person through what I go through every day, I wouldn't have. It's not that I don't love my children and that I don't thank God for them every single second of every day, it's that I don't want my baby to feel like that, it's just not fair seeing a nine year old not confident in himself. He's NINE! He should be digging holes in the yard and climbing trees, but instead we have a weekly therapy appointment. I wouldn't wish these feelings on my worst enemy, let alone my baby boy, my favorite person in the whole world. I just want to hug him and make it better but I can't. This world sucks.
I'm so glad Christina decided to do this, truly reflective of our world now.   Don't forget:  the original music video had just an important and empowering message ❤ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAfyFTzZDMM
girlie i bopped to this song so hard as a little pea in the pod.
This is beautiful but unfortunately this is the real life of our children! Congratulations Cristina!
Still crying because of this song ❤️
Wtf is this
I just cried when I heard the song for the first time, I remembered my childhood and how much I suffered with my appearance, since I was 20 I couldn't accept myself as I am, and today I love myself
Got it:  1.  Put the phone down.  2.  Run outside and play.  Now that Christina is a parent, I'm sure she sees this song differently, too.
As someone who was born after this came out, it was played when I was too young to understand it. Finding this on my feed makes me realize how much I truly missed the message. I can't stop crying from how much this song has an impact on me, not only from it's message, but also my childhood. Thank you.
0:47 I was so sure that was selena gomez omg
i'm not crying... YOU'RE crying! 😭
The sentiment is good and all for women, but are we really comparing plastic surgery with working out at the gym though? 🤔
Oh wow, a videoclip like this in this era? This is what I call brave
Thank you. Love it.... through my teens now for other teens... in tears. Last part was wholesome.
literal chills
Christina Aguilera - Beautiful (Taylor's Version)
The tree part is really important. Kids are meant to “climb trees”. Aka let kids be kids
Wow!!!
Love the message no matter what yr it is. But its hard to take it seriously from someone who KEEPS doing these things to herself and doesnt take back what surgery she can take back.
Excelente video,con gran mensaje! 👏
Wow
WOW
Good job Christina. This song has been a backbone then and evermore now. God bless you. :)
Whāŧ ís ŧhè pøíñŧ øf ŧhíš víđèø? Íß ŧhíß yøŧh ŧō ŧrãñßprōpàgæŋđæ?
2 years ago my friends 12 year old daughter was standing before me, telling me she is fat. This girl had not a single gramm of fat on her body, was sporty and fit and just a happy healthy kid. I asked he where the heck she got that Idea and she showed me the magazines with drawn "topmodels". Because she doesn't look like that, she thought she was fat. I was shocked to say the least. So I explained to her that this is not reality, and that she should just look at her Mum, or me or any other Women she knows from school or the neighbarhood. Everyone looks different and that is a good thing. I also told her that she is not by any means fat, and if she ever is unsure to ask her doctor if she needs to loose weight.  We all need to look out for Kids that age and how they see themselfs. It is so important ...
This is such a powerful message and I agree whole heartedly. I miss the days before social media took over our lives.
I used to role my eyes when this was sung to me, seeing this now is really impactful and important
I wish I could like this 100 times! A very timeless message!
Thank you Christina Aguilera ♥️
Okay but why am I crying?
This song is everything..
I'm crying. Such a timeless song. I love it.
I’m in literal tears.😢 Thank you Christina for creating a visual of what is happening to this generation.   REMEMBER EVERYONE, all of this is brand new with human existence. We have no idea how this is affecting everyone and we’re all bound to have extremely different reactions based on personality. This is about to be crazy in the next decade/two is what I keep saying. PRIORITIZE YOURSELF, go out in nature, find out which books interest you, learn about yourself. Who you were created to be! Learn who you are!
timeless artist
It's a pity that regardless of this very true message, Christina still had to get fillers and stuff to keep looking young for the industry.
so kewnsowmed
Oh this version is perfect.
本当に最高の一曲の一つです。 ありがとう❤💙😭🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵🇯🇵
Waa FULLBODY GOOSEBUMPS... UWUU I'M IN TEARS...Thank Xtina for this gift.😭😭😭😭 Pls spare ur child from toxicity of the world..
Apparently, it's 2000-era ballad song with a brand-new video. I was expecting to listen to this song with a new arrangement and improvisation and lively beats like a remix or something. But don't get me wrong, I love this song all this time.
This is exactly what was need to be done and extremely powerful meaning❤
This is so fake! Not a single person has an iPhone in this video.
LET'S ALLOW KIDS TO BE KIDS AGAIN ❤
Omgggggggggg yesssssss I love this music video so much slayyyyyy
Incrivelmente simples, necessário, emocionante e verdadeiro ❤
not me trying to get more attractive 💀
I'm 40. It isn't easy to be 40. I'm not young. But I'm not middle-aged yet. And I'm not old.  I remember this song. Can we leave it where it is? This pressure of making past looking new is strange. I want to look back at music and know what it represents. And I want to look forward to listening new sounds. But this is... Weird.
The most inspiring song  Incredible voice absolutamente una queen
🥹🥺❤️
I’m speechless… what a great re-release! The message is loud and clear. I hope we as a society start changing for the better. ❤️
Get surgery to please yourself, only in extreme conditions. Ain't nobody lives your life, fuck whatever they say.
Me crying remembering how hard I was on myself as a kid. Didn't even have the mind space to just be a kid.
This song was impactful when it first came out and just as impactful now. To anyone reading this just know that you are beautiful at your most authentic you. You are loved and valued. You don't have to change a thing. 💕💕
Christina - You are Beautiful ❤❤ Voice, Mind and Soul.
Papa Franku, we miss you.😭
Tão verdade. Tantas cobranças. Tantos padrões...
💕💕💕💕
Wow 🤩 thank you. My early teen years flashing back. #legendaryqueen
Old song but the problem still temporary 🥺
This was true, is true, and will always be true. Thank you Christina!
but how valuable stays the message of song and video when we all know that the artist herself underwent so many aesthetic surgeries?
🤍🥹✨
🇨🇾 Amazing! Some things seems that never change! Because sometimes some people are stupid! They are not clever enough to understand the real meaning of life! The other people who see that, should help them escape from that misery! 🙏 Thank you! Please all who read this, be strong or find the strength to stay alive! Because you are beautiful no matter what! ❤️💖
Guess you can only be beautiful if you are skinny and hegemonic, ok, i understand
I'm honestly scared for my little girl growing up in this current time... Isnt it crazy that we need to hope they stay themselves and don't look in the mirror one day and want to be Kyle Jenner or whatever is " fashionable" in that moment. I'm scared. I really am. Trying to teach her how special she is inside and out and that she's perfect the way she is. But how much more impact will highschool and friends have then my boring mom words... This message is SO needed. <3
Omg I'm so greatful to hear this song again and its message😂👍
🥺🥺🥺
Thank you for releasing this. Ive been struggle with my health and i cried everyday. Im scared of losing something precious from my body. But gotta stay strong life must go on 💔
I loved this song from the day it was first released until now. So meaningful..💕
Thank you ❤

😢😢😢😢
This literally made me cry. I feel for my kids and sisters generation.
❤😢
Que tristeza las redes sociales nos están matando
20 years later and still relevant, that doesn't make this song just great. That makes it important.
all people in tiktok have to watch this
https://youtu.be/xkR_uIHhsqM
The lack of kids with disabilities in this is pretty telling.  It’s cool.  You’re beautiful.  Just look “normal.”  Gross as the first time.
I grew up hearing this song and singing it over and over again for a long time ❤ I'm so glad that now after 20 years  this song still makes me feel good about myself
I still love this song, makes me feel so comfortable and alive
When the original song was released I was 11 years old, I can still remember seeing the gay kiss up until this day. Had never seen one before. that kiss made me realize, that I liked men.
I love this song I met in glee until today and my favorite songs from the cast that represents me a lot
I used to starve myself in middle-school, i used a waist-trainer, counted calories below the minimum daily requirement. i’d get upset whenever i’d have to binge out of necessity by the end of the week, and see my weight gain on the scale each day even if it was just by 3 pounds. i did this for many reasons, but one big one was to look like the girls i saw on social media. nowadays i’ve learned to love my body the way it is, and eat healthier and take care of myself, but still meet myself where i’m at. self-love and body neutrality is something i struggle with, but am happy i’ve improved over the years. ❤
It's sad to think I was my happiest when I was popping pills to suppress my appetite and lose weight.....there was once a time when popping pills gave me the strength to turn into something I was happy with but now as an adult I put on more and more weight because I'm too depressed to try something that never seems to work or there never seems to be enough time or energy for. I'm not depressed now but I eat whatever I want without a second thought and that is just as unhealthy as popping pills....  I'll find balance one day hopefully but this song will hit me differently then most...for me it just says though I may be beautiful Im never enough for the world around me and even though many people feel this same way struggling with self worth we still push eachother to present what is "acceptable" If we stop caring about our image people see that and think you face other issues or judge you and then when you try you are putting too much pressure on yourself....it's an endless struggle that has excites for thousands of years and sadly isn't something easily changed
Sad world
Ay me encanta ❤ es tan real.
Immediate chills, I was so shocked to see something so true so fast and so hard, I know too much friends dealing with mental health, taking pills. Immediate chills seeing it on the same screen
I’m weeping at this video and remembering how much this song meant to me as a 13 year old when it came out. Thank you, Christina ❤
I wish everyone lived with these words in their minds.
things can change within 20 years, and this song is perfect for the generation that’re trying many ways to look more “attractive” when really they’re perfect the way they are. our generation needed this song, and i thank you for putting it out there again christina ❤
The legend that is Linda Perry,who wrote her the song ♥️
Sorry but these r all conventionally beautiful people anyway….
Moral of the story: go outside and touch some grass
Christina's songs are literally the only songs that make me cry buckets 😭😭😭
As the mother of an 11 y/o girl, who was 22 and getting married at the  time of  the original release, I bawled. This is needed. The ending visual especially. Our kids are screaming, ~begging to be heard, and we need to listen. Schools, places of worship, community service centers, influencer culture and social media -- ALL need to hear them. This hit me very deep. Thank you, Christina. Thank you. xXx
I was wondering why this song was always on my front page of suggesteds before I clicked on it and saw it was a 2022 remake- I'm so happy I found this out because kids NEED this. I thought we needed it before (and we did), but the ease of access everyone of EVERY age has to content that makes them insecure about whether their body is in or out of trend is INSANE. This is a life message song.
This song still hits the same since the release. 😭😭😭 all the emotions flooding back!!
👏👏👏
i cried. Malawi is loosing 26 young people to suicide every month. As Africans we never really thought we would face this because our culture never allows us to say much. Recently due to internet and the whole global village young people in Malawi have realised how such a silent culture is suffocating them. It hurts so much because most grown ups here dont understand its words like 'you're a bubblegum culture' (meaning they are too soft). I am 34 and faced abandonment and extreme anxiety in my teens because of all i went through. I am happy to be working for one of our local TVs and have a platform to share my story but i still wonder if i am making a big enough impact. People out there, if you know anyone in Malawi, reach out to them, send them love and comfort because not only is our socio economic system crumbling, our youth is also frustrated and giving up. We need the love from all y'all. I know people blame our governments but we cant let a whole nation suffer for the mistakes of less that 1000 people in a country of around 19 million
wow.
I cried 20 years ago watching this music video when I was younger and I cry again watching this now! Great messages, allow kids to live and be kids!
I hope your song go viral and become famous through tiktok cover. This generation really need this. ❤️
we need this message.
Eu te amo tanto. Você é extremamente necessária.
The part that hit me hardest watching the video this time, was the young guy get a hug from the other guy. I’m happy that the music video makes an effect to be broadly inclusive and even touched on the isolation many young men are experiencing. Idk that hug hit differently.
🧐🧐the message of the song and the video is of course once again terrific!  But: ✋I don't think Christina Aguilera is the right person to present such a song, because who had a badly done BBL done, breasts etc.?  If she stayed true to herself and loved herself the way she is, then the song with her would be very authentic.  But like this... nice try...
How amazing! Congratulations Christina for such an eye-opening video. The scene where the 5 or 6 girls shout all together gave me the chills. It was a cry for NO MORE OF THESE STEREOTYPES!!! And the hug of the 2 male friends was so warm-hearted. A video that gives hope and cries for a change. Thank you for doing this!!!!
This brang me to tears. Thank you
Jadi inget lagunya kak yura yunita yang dunia tipu tipu ya. We are beautiful with our way
I feel this fits better in today’s Society with the way kids feel about them selfs gonna definitely show my daughter this video i know I needed it back then and today still hits hard every time u listen to it
💗💗💗💗
How many times I've played that song when I was getting beaten up after school by a 4-5 boys. (Yes, I shared with a grown up at 11 y o and they made me go speak with a teacher and the teacher told me "If I don't see scars and bruises, and it dosent happen every single day- you are a liar 🤥!")
20 years after... this song is still ringing like à Bell to wake all of us up about judgement , stereotypes and shit like this... Love yourself the way you are... We all damn fucking beautiful 💕💕
I'm really happy about this! It got worse over the years. Derma fillers, botox, nose jobs, eye brow lifts, breast enlargements, all are more popular than before and readily available, people are more insecure because of social media popularity. All the posers on social media, shamelessly in love with themselves
🔥🔥🔥so smart for her to release this song again with new video I love this song
Thank you. ❤️👏🏼
adults also.
Beautiful.
Beautiful!
I also recommend Colbie Caillat's music video "Try"
goosebumps
Relistening to this song now, it hits ALOT different, this song made me cry. I used to be so insecure as a teen, I would cover every mirror I saw and if I did see myself in the mirror I would stand there looking disguised, I remember always skipping this song whenever I heard it as a child because it would make me mad, because back then I was thinking "This song doesn't apply to me" but now, I'm so much more confident in myself and hearing this song, looking back at my younger self I wish I could hug her and tell her she's beautiful, no matter what other people say, she really is beautiful, I hate how I treated myself when I was younger, growing up with social media definitely hurt my self esteem, especially since I've been growing up when social media had just started to get more popular. Social media is so dangerous. Whoever reads this you're beautiful, handsome, stunning, you look amazing, you shine, I love you ❤️
herself as beautiful, no matter what they say.
This song got me through my youth when it was first released and honestly, I am so happy this is re-released with a more "current" aesthetic for the youth today. I had anxiety/depression from a very early age and wasn't diagnosed until I was 19/20. Still now at 30 I'm going through therapy with a Psychologist, using medication prescribed by my GP and every single day is a battle. Music is the only thing that makes me feel like I can continue on through this life. Thank you Christina for your music <3 it has been absolutely instrumental on my journey.
Loving this song just as much now as I did 20 years ago its crazy how time flies but this re-release was needed very beautiful no pun intended lol
I'm a teacher, and I can see everyday how children are bad influenced by phones...it's so sad, and I'm afraid of the future. When I watched the scene when the kids are playing outside I cried a lot. Thank you to send this message. I hope this change as soon as possible because otherwise we are lost.
This is really cool. When song help to thinking about real situation with social network. Thank you)))
20 years after it's released.. This Is Still Beautifully RELEVANT! 🙏💯🤍
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Tears🤍🤍🤍🔥🔥🎊🎁🎁🎁💯🤍
we are all beautiful. we are unique in our own special ways! have a great day everyone and remember we are all beautiful.
Child me is crying
I have ALWAYS loved this song... Sure an amazing update. I will be showing my 10yo tonight
Such a beautiful song that  future  growing generations need to hear as music.
Love yourself...🫶🏼 Forever this song❤️‍🔥
this version is better!
I was 13 when this song originally aired in 2002. The timing was perfect then and it is perfect now. To young people today, remember that you are all beautiful just the way you are ❤
"Let there be light."
Everyone is like a lit candle, a flame, burning bright and doing their bit to bring light and warmth to this world, but when you drive people to depression, anger, bitterness, and even death with cruelty, you snuff out their flame and the world gets that little bit darker, that little bit colder.  Keep those flames burning bright and be KIND. To everyone. It’s not always an easy choice to be kind but it is always the RIGHT choice. Even the most simple kindness can change people’s lives and set them on a brighter path. Everyone deserves to feel beautiful, valued, appreciated, loved.   Carry your candle with confidence and pride, and when you see others around you whose flame is dying, reignite their flame with yours. Give them a reason to keep holding that candle. Look out for each other. Do your bit to make this world a better place.
loving this song
Legend voice, but why a minor for a model??
She knew this generation needed this song just as much as we did 20 years ago 😢
Why they are so easy to distracted. My friends have mobile phone since highschool and i don't have and it's okay. My friends go out, have a party but i go to gym , keep practicing and that's made me have wonderful job with wonderful people.  People struggling with their family but i already know i don't want one since i was young. I just enjoy myself and that's why i thing people today are so weak, they don't even know themselves.
Ironically all these kids had to compete for a “role” in this video, based on how they look.
Recognized that at the end, where children are happy, there is nő phone or internet? This is the most important message as the key to happiness of this remake I guess
This video gave me chills! Amazing and unfortunately so true!!
I remember charice pempengco but now he is jake zyrus now😅
No matter if you're a 90s kid or a today's kid, no one survives their teen and young adult years unscathed. You are enough. YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.
Thank you for reminding me how beautiful we still are in 2022
When this was released many years ago, I printed the lyrics out and taped the paper to my mirror. This is a timeless song.
All the kids are so beautiful with their unique beauty, I’m crying
Beautiful
I loved this song when ai was a teenager and was very important for me. Amazing you rereleased this.
この曲にはたくさん救われてきたけど、新しいPVも素敵で心にグッとくるものがある。
Amazing
This is what children of todays generation missed. The happiness and contentment of just simply playing outside with friends, with nature. Kids of today knows no social interaction, mostly engaging into techy games, or social media.  Rushing into things to be adult. HOPE children, kids, teenagers can still see and enjoy the beauty in themselves and in others and in the things that they have ryt now,. AND  not be fooled and pressured by the beauty  defined by social media.
20 years later... Thank you, my Queen, Xtina ♡
This is beautiful 😭😭😭❤️
*REALLY !!?*
I wish my child version of myself had watched this🥺 So many self-harm wouldn’t have happened 😕
CHRISTINA AGUILERA!!💜💛💙❤️____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Justamente estos días estaba pensando en la falta que me hacía escuchar una canción que me motive e inspire y aparece Christina con este bello regalo, me sigue emocionando como en el 2002 💗un poderoso mensaje.
Wooow Christina! Que gran video!! Hasta lloré por todas las veces que me sentí o vi a alguien mal y por pensar en todas las personas que viven pensando en ser más hermosos cuando ya lo son!😢😢😢  Eres grandeee!!!❤❤❤
Body Dysmorphia has always been my demon and midnight battle I consciously starve myself and go hard on myself while working out but I keep hearing words like; “you are too big, you putting on weight, you’re incompetent, you won’t last long or make it even when you try to workout, damn, you ain’t got six packs, you’re a hypocrite, ugly” etc…. List is so endless, rather stop here 😢😢😢. thank you for this song Aguilera.😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
Love the song but the orignal video is way better.
E eu tow preso né mores? Pelo Governo do Cristo
Saí daí Hanneta Lopes que eu fico com meu caderno também kkkkk
내청소년시기에 항상 함께했던노래인데♡
Ja dieser Song ist doch aktueller denn je in der heutigen Gesellschaft und seinem Streben nach dem falschen Schönheitsidealen. Dabei ist doch jeder Mensch schön auf seine eigene Weise egal wie er aussieht.
Like it ❤️
How about we show some love for Linda Perry… Without her, this song wouldn’t exist. She’s the real genius behind this message. Put some respect on her name! 👏🏼❤️
I'm crying. I love this album❤ here I am, 20 years later, older but still beautiful. And so are you❤
This song is really meant for this year, spread love and appreciation❤️
💠🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸✝️Thank you Christina! God bless you Christina!✝️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💠
social media has become the kingdom of persecutors. they turned the human body into industry, Our perception of beauty is ruined because of the thought system created by the fashion industry. Celebrities who impose this perception are now turning to naturalness to get rid of their silicones and botox and NOT BE LIKE EVERYONE. Damn you all!
Thank you for staying true to the original message of this song whilst still incorporating real life problems affecting our children <3
The screaming out loud scene is very powerful - Thank you Christina
Oh Fuckerberg & Co.... Something to add ?
Thank you for not going woke with this.. Kids need to be kids.  They deserve innocence.  This brought a tear to my eye.
Don't look at me Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is? You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side 'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
Powerful song with an even more powerful message in this video. Thanks!
Tan real que pone los pelos de punta.
This generation needed this
This song relate to every generation.
Beautiful young people of the world. We all have love no matter what x
Life Is Harder For A Woman!!!!!
20 years later, if you are not creative, just REMAKE EVERYTHING
I love the kids climbing in trees and just playing and being kids😢 kids don’t need to face the harsh reality of the world right in the faces on a screen every single minute of everyday. You get enough of the world being shitty as an adult
this song hits hard.
This song literally creeps me out it’s a horror sho 😮 this video is psycho
Love the video and a powerful message to everyone that we are beautiful and forget them haters
we are one
Impossible not to cry with this song …
This video won’t ever come near close to the original one…
Absolutely my fav music, thank you so much for bringing this back with such important message. <3
Я из России здесь жить нелегко да еще эта война пойду напьюсь
I love this song. I like social media. I am just glad that I wasn't exposed to it super  early like this generation was. I am 30 and didn't have a cell phone until I was 20. So I remember what it was like before we had social media and we were constantly comparing ourselves to others.
The tree scene made me cry...so simple and powerful, love ya women <3
Gosh. This song is still beautiful. ❤
petition to make christina sing *mamma knows best*
Funny how 20mins later this song is still important but yet it’s vision is so very different. In another 20yrs it’ll change again.
This was so beautifully done.. I literally was brought to tears when the little girl woke up In the grass and was climbing trees and running around. These kids need to be freed from the restraints of their phones.  Thanks Christina!
Eu não sabia que precisava tanto assistir uma nova versão do video de "Beautiful" até assitir a nova versão.
That's what I miss... Kids being kids. Not worrying about their body, their gender, their popularity...
cool, but I don't think it's as impactful as the original clip. However, I understand that it is for this current generation.   Omg I was waiting for the kiss 🤡😂
More important than ever
Wow! That’s a great song, great message! 🤍
❤
This is beautiful !!
thank you.
Strong message! 👏👏👏
Christina is a true queen. I am stanning the a good one y’all
Beautiful song as always.....
I couldn’t imagine being a teen right now. These poor kids can’t just grow through growing up without having things all over online and they are just consuming so much content all he time. If you’re younger, hang in there and get off social media
The original was much better, this just feels unnecessary
Wow I’m grown as hell and this song still cuts deep. All these years later 🥺I never remembered to love myself for so long. I’m glad I’ve finally begun to do that.
I’m very thankful for the fact you have updated the visual for this important and never ending lesson, the struggle changes with the times, this in itself was beautiful.
All these young girls looking up to the kartrashians need to look up to Tina over hear and her true words of wisdom
It helped me right now! Thank You!!!
Minuto 1:08 Rompí en lágrimas ¡Gracias por esta reflexión Christina Aguilera! You still being amazing.
wouahh les frissons !!! :):
wow
Promoting obesity is also promoting self harm.
soooooooooooooooooo much beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OMG almost 5 million views in less than a month! I love this song.
Thank you for this version it is especcialy important now!
You are beautiful in every single way. ❤
I miss this era, when kids are still kids, playing outside and are not insecure of how they look, if they have dirts or how's their make up for girls, and if they look cool or how's their muscles for boys. They just run freely with smile on their faces.
An eye opener for those people who love to fake reality for the sake of views, likes, and followers.
This song still makes me cry ❤
Slh 1 lagu yg srg gue denger berulang2 dimana2.. 😂
Will there be a 2022 version of "Genie in a bottle" please
Of course they would change it to have transferred people and gay people in it
Timeless 🥰
With smart phones nowadays, this song is more accurate than it was and its really hard to see that many people are so lost in the world of social media 🥲 and this song will prosper for more years to come.
I do surgery for my breast....because a lot of mans tell me "you haven't a woman body without breast"....  I cry when I see the guide line on the body of the younger woman.... I love my new boobs but the bodyshaming was condition me a lot of time in my live.
❤️😊
Words can bring me down, in fact, they take me underground. I’m working on it.
😭
Back when this song came out it saved me. Thank you so much for helping me stay alive I was the the Atlanta concert in 2003 and I cried during this song, thank you for saving my life 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
thank you Christina Aguilera
What a beautiful message!
Funny how you're standing behind this, Christina Aguilera, being one of the millions of women getting their lips done, botox and fillers just because aging and looking natural won't make you cool and sexy and making reggaeton-esque songs just because the industry or some big fish made you feel you needed to do that in order to being trendy, keep being popular and staying away from oblivion. Maybe you had something to say back in 2002 with "Beautiful" about these subjects but now you just look like part of this imposed, phony "let's all talk about mental issues and... climate change and animal well-being! so we can get some likes and views and retweets and headlines and agreements with top brands and a wider swimming pool" sort of celebrity trend.   You just make this campaign so hard to believe for someone like me who's been following you and your career for ages seeing that you've been a victim of society, music and all kind of trends since 2008. And let me tell you: you still are. Don't get me wrong: to me, you're hands down one of the greatest artist of all times and I bet your voice and what you meant specially with 'Dirrty' and 'Back to Basics' will be remembered for centuries as part of the music history. You're already a legend.   But you should think about what you've done lately, who's the person and the artist you've become, who you've been hanging with and what kind of messages you've been delivering with your work and actions. And if you do, eventually, you might see this campaign as hollow as it is. This is not help; this is toxicity and confusing propaganda for just a bit of attention. If you trully support what this video is about, you wouldn't have a single account in no social network, you'd be still honoring the greatest classic black female voices of all times without caring about selling or being played on the radios, you'd be part of an indie record company and your world tours would be all about tiny crowds in tinier venues.   THAT IS! what "Beautiful" means to a lot of people out there and what the core of every shot in this video is really about.
Powerful back then..powerful right now!
This video wouldn't feel so hypocritical if she wasn't the exact type of social media influencer this video is condemning. Over s3xualized and always showing off her chest and body in provocative poses, all you need to do if look at her Instagram page to see what I'm talking about.
❤❤❤❤
bleeding from the phone is one heck of a visual.
I haven't heard this song in years and I still remember every word, every note, and every run. I love this song, and it's just as good as it was when I first heard it 20 years ago. It's an absolute classic
💕💕
I can only imagine growing up as a kid or a teen right now with social media comparison. I hope this song reaches out to those that need a reminder that you are beautiful and you aren’t alone when it comes to insecurities, we all have them.🤍✨
This song helped me get through my weight struggles
LEGEND
Piękna smutna prawda kiedyś nam niebyło potrzeba tel żeby porozmawiać z koleżanką trza było się przełamać " przestać być pizdą😉" jedno hasło i wszyscy byli na boisku bez tel bez neta i zawsze temat był piękne czasy 😉
Really good message but she wears a lot of make up and has operated lips and other stuff done, so she criticizes something that she she does 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Thank you.
Wow. Thank you for doing this.
I thought she sang it again. This is just the Same Song with another Music Video.
Cristina #Forever
The world needs this song more than ever before. Remember, sweethearts, you wouldn't exist if not for a long line of ancestors valued powerfully by other humans. Just because your genes aren't compatible with some doesn't mean that there is no one who can see every single aspect of your worth. DO NOT let those fools convince you that you aren't worth anything.   All our special colors and shapes are beautiful. There is worth in you whether some people see it or not. You hold that pride inside of you until you find a place where you are seen.
Wow! Now this is powerful! 👌🏾
I'm crying.
2:42 “oh sorry i wasn’t recording”
❤️❤️❤️
wow! same sentiment now that it had back when it was first released. I find now with social media the kids these days have it worse.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
As a 17yo who hates herself and does everything to change myself has a social anxiety, anxiety and depresion because i was being bullied for my looks for 4 years by my classmates and mother i needed this so thank you so much❤️
I can't even watch this. Feeling sad for my young kids.  Maybe they will reject this hall of mirrors as part of their youthful rebellious stage.  You sort of already see this I suppose with current high schoolers and all the baggy clothing from the 90s.
Thank you Xtina Aguilera
This song aged so well 😢
In the past, humans predict that robots will take over society. They did...in a form of a phone.
tem como curtir mais de uma vez?
I Love you Christina 😍😍❤️❤️
After 2 decades, we still struggled with all these problems. It's kind of sad. And THX Xtina for such beautiful song.
Вот чтт сделал  Дисней с Кристиной. Абсолютнл сумашедшая и невменяемая баба.
Propaganda 2022 version. If you dont look good then you dont look good no matter how much she makes off fooling you.
This is really good song
The original means the world to me but this video... the kids.... I am bawling my eyes out because I was one of those kids, poisoned by media and people, telling me I was never enough, never good enough, pretty enough, anything. I was diagnosed with disordered eating the same time the original came out. I was a self-harmer too... and it all started when I was a kid, before I was even a teen. We gotta find a way to break this, break this poisoned chain and let kids just be kids, let teens grow strong and confident. And maybe, when they become adults, they won't be so broken and destroyed. I am now 42, and I am FINALLY starting to accept myself, starting to see the beauty no one else ever did see. And if they did see it, they never told me... so this song, means everything to me. This and Unpretty.
This is amazing ❤ love how timeless this song is
No matter what they say!
The Sad Truth...  They claim, you can be thick and beautiful, but still use the skinny-filter.  They claim you are perfect just as you are, but having a tiny nose and big lips is better.  Contouring your face to NOT look like you is a Must.  They offer anti-depressants instead of talk therapy.  They call it narcissist "disorder", I call it being an arrogant entitled asshole. They say "Freedom of Speech", until you give an opinion then everyone's offended.  Young people are getting plastic surgery and fillers, older generations age gracefully.  They say "we should catch up sometime for a coffee", meaning...you will never ever see me.   The world turns a blind eye, it's not your average-joe starting these trends, it's people with power and influence.   It's the Kardashians that made plastic surgery "cool".  What I don't understand is, how in the hell do people keep loving them? What is it that makes them worthy of praise?  They've got absolutely nothing to offer besides money that gave them their un-original beauty.
that girl which dreamed of big breast looks sooo much like Chilli from TLC video "Unpretty"))
Tears are falling from my eyes we can still bless the next generation, i do believe in looking good healthy and beautiful but the world has taken extremes. The world needs to heal
Generational curses
This new video is so real wow in what kind of world i we living
This song has resonated for decades. Despite its obvious message, our children continue to be exploited. Their hopes and dreams continue to be reshaped by images that are not real. Popular media figures propagate the lie because it feels so good to be that 1%. In the face of real evidence that our children and grandchildren are suffering, ad campaigns push their agenda forward. This song could not be more important. We are beautiful, just as we are. All of us.
A tear literally dropped watching this
Such a beautiful message 😢
Kids Version 😀

The words in the song in today's set up are even more powerful. This song is a total reminder that you are special, that the real definition of beautiful is you.
i have completly forget  this beautiful song of my teenage rebel moment this was so awsome , thank you for this  important message for life to cheer.
That phone in the blood image... that is creepy. *shudders*   This song still resonates, even now. Thank you for updating this message - the fact that we have children, young children obsessing over their image, is shocking.  The youngest child I've read about with body dysmorphia/eating disorders was a little girl of FOUR - thanks to her mother drumming it into her to stay tiny, the little girl ate nothing but 4 apples a day. Her mother, however, was grossly overweight and was deliberately pigging out on KFC and other junk food in front of this child to spite her.  The little girl was taken straight into foster care and counselling. The mother was done for neglect and abuse. Ironically, the mother was being bullied for her weight, and it made her pig out more and binge-eat - if she thought that practically starving that little girl was "protecting" her, she had another thing coming!
I work in an inpatient psychiatric hospital.  I'm so happy that mental health is being more openly discussed. Thank you so much for being an advocate for mental health and for adding mental health resources to your website. ❤️
Amazing Christina 😍
Wow hermoso video y mensaje. Así debería ser!! Niños siendo niños. Niños pensando y haciendo cosas de niños. Niños libres!
🥹🥲🥲🙏🤍
Fans de thalia apoyando a la voz de la generacion
Loved this song for many years. Thank you for it ❤
Absolutely love this video. Although, I wish the last informative clip with the phone would have been in the beginning. That way the video can end in an optimistic note of the children rejecting the beauty standards set by social media rather than a dark one.
So true....so sad😢
This is one of my top favourite Christina Aguilera songs and is so relevant in this day and age. This song had helped me accept both my flaws and my good qualities of my being especially after becoming a mum and struggling with my self esteem and image.
This not gonna be a trend on tiktok
its hard to take the video seriously when you have literal models acting in the video but at least we got hte message right?
This video is so powerful!
this really hits hard sometimes... if you are reading this or need to hear this, here you go... it will get better, this will pass and there are people out there who love you for who you are
So eye opening!
Beautiful, as always.
THIS WAS GENIUS!!! Thank you Christina for doing this, people like you and Selena are really making a change ❤️✨
Fantastico, le immagini e la musica colpiscono il segno, grazie 🙏
Beautiful message
I thank you for using your platform to spread the awarness ❤️💕
Our children deserve the TRUTH.
La primera vez que la escuché me llego demasiado y ver que alguien me dijera que “todos somos hermosos sin importar que la otra gente diga” era raro para esos tiempos que un artista lo dijera tan directamente. 2022 escuchando y viendo este video me sigue llegando y dejándome con lágrimas en la cara, porque aún tengo una lucha constante de eso. Gracias Christina Aguilera por esta canción tan hermosa y significativa para nosotros
I was not expecting to cry so much this morning lol Profound and beautiful
I love the beautiful music video. I just missed Christina Aguilera in this video
This video is BEAUTIFUL! what we have done with our world and perception of every people? 😔
Legend
I hate being so insecure bc of the way I look and act.
But does it helps.... ? I don't know..   As a gay guy I ' am so tired of it..... 🙈
This is amazing
I'm so glad this popped on my feed, this is such a powerful song!
This is amazing!! Thank you for creating this for our children
is just me or are all the kids pretty and skinny. I was always the fat ugly kid so it doesn't help me
Eminem>
What a sad thing that these days being beautiful is via the phone....
It just show us that things got worse!
If you genuinely cared about this, you wouldn't plug your own website at the end. You would put resources that are completely focused on these issues. I'm so tired of people celebrities/influencers acting like they care, but than shamelessly plug their shit.
Música atemporal! Muito necessária! Cirúrgica! 🥰🥺
this song was awesome when it came out hard hitting for the times and this version IMO isn't as hard but reflective of the young generation we have today
Absolutely amazing videography and storywriting! Oh how I wish we could actually do something about the toxic beauty standards online quickly... Guess we'll have to go for a whole cultural change the upcoming years..
You are beautiful without puberty blockers and surgery!
"You are beautiful no matter they say". The song would have meant more if Christina Aguilera thought she was beautiful and didn't get so many plastic surgery procedures. She cares what they say.
Realista más que nunca!
😞
so it is today also in the beginning of the handytime... i was born in the 80s, and i miss the time when everything was possbible without this fu..ing handys. i am a mother too and it is very hard to find the balance between nature and digital... i do my best for my three pretty children - the beauty inside of them is so lightful!
😢😢❤️
When i turned 20, i thought i had been lucky never having had "teen" problems, i thought i was safe, that i had run fast enough to never let them reach me.   I am 23 now and i started crying towards the end of the song because i've had an eating disorder since june and nobody knows it. i should have known better, i thought i was "above" this social media craze, but my phone is packed with pictures of people i wish i looked like and i'm missing out on life to be like them. it's exhausting.
I don't agree with everything Christina does, but this song really helped me at school so I'll always be greatful for that
Its so messed up that this is how life is now
Wow! This was so powerful. Thank you, Christina. 💕
Yessss spread positivity ❤️❤️❤️
Oh Jezus this hit me hard  I was 12 when this song came out and already had major issues with myself, can't imagine being 12 in this period...  Such a strong message that will always be so valuable.
My daughter was born to this song in June this year. And I must say she’s very beautiful.
kendi küçük hapishanelerimiz
It’s getting to the newest generations sadly they’re targeted at an early age. I’m gen z i know we are known for using technology but my first years of childhood I wasn’t exposed to technology and I remember playing with my sibling and having beautiful memories until phones came. Now i see my sister from gen alpha having no childhood because she was exposed to phones at an early age and feel so bad that she would never know what a real childhood is. She thinks that playing with other kids is boring and all she wants to do is be on the phone. These kids also lost their innocence
I knew this was deep
The song is like the tittle "beautiful" but it's meanigless if we (adults, parents, relatives, friends...) talk shit about other people's bodies in front of our children. Pressure our kids to look better than the rest, get the best scores, have the best job (I mean, it's ok to value good things that kids get with their effort but not pressuring them) Don't body shamming others and not talk shit about other people in front of children because that it's more value to them that the moment that you use this song to teach them... They are not stupid, they know that this is a song but the real world still spected from them to look perfect, to be perfect...  PS: Sorry, english is not my mother tongue.

This song is more current than ever, they've done a beautiful job with the video too.
I just remember of glee version
love you forevers
This song spoke strongly to me as a kid. The original music video was the first time I had ever seen two gay men be intimate and it was shown with beauty and empowerment, not shame or disgust or the butt of a joke. I hope it can resonate with kids today as well.
Kids are being influenced at a much younger age now.  Quick to go under the knife and take drastic measures to look a certain way.  I wish kids could just be kids.
On dirai une pub pour Nutella ❤️ miam
🥺
I heard the song for the first time as a teenager, bullying because of my looks was the order of the day and then I heard this song and it gave me strength to become the woman I am today. I still find it very sad that this terrible bullying is still relevant. Thank you Christina for leaving another, very deep meaning to the song in combination with the video.
La letra es maravillosa aunque el vídeo no deja de mostrar niños y niñas hegemónicos.. Delgados, lindos, sin discapacidades... El mensaje queda a medias
2022 and this song is just as important now as it was back then. Aguilera may not be my preferred genre or artist, but I can absolutely recognize talent and truth when I see it. I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING!!
this is so inspiring. thank you christina <3
this is really touching
Omgggg😢
It's really crazy. I wasn't even on social media as a teen because it was just starting to be a thing at the time But still, when I was a teen I felt ugly. I always compared myself to the teens in movies. I always asked myself why I didn't look like them. Like my body and face always looked younger than theirs. Now I know. The actors weren't teenagers. They were in their 20s. I couldn't look like them, because I was way younger then them.  This alone is so harmful, because teens compare themselves to people who are much older than them. And with social media it got even worse. I personally use a lot of social media and I also like it, but there are so many influencers who promote toxic and dangerous body images. It's just not ok.
My favorite Linda Perry song.
I don't know if this version hits harder because I'm older, most of the kids in the video are younger, or the fact that this message just as (if not more) relevant 20 years later. We really do need to be kinder to ourselves.
words can't express how grateful I am that you came out with a 22' version video, extremely correct and thank you
I know it’s late. I don’t care  In a week and a half it will be 20 years (😰) since the first song I remember hearing on the radio came out. I know it’s a cliche, but mind you they wore out the record with Beautiful by Christina Aguilera.   I was 3 years old when it released and even though I was too young to understand what it was talking about, I loved it. I dared anyone to touch that dial on the radio when it came on.   When I was 7 I was given access to the internet. Only for about an hour and it was monitored (as it still should be for children IF THAT) I would spend my time watching music videos and would ask my mom permission before watching a certain artist because it was already predetermined that some artists had a reputation for being inappropriate for a 7 year old.   So of course when I wanted to watch that video my mom was like “I don’t think that’s a good idea”. Not because of the message, but because it was not appropriate for a 7 year old!  Well I am her child so I watched it anyway 🤣  It was the first time ever seeing, hearing, or reading about two men kissing. There were a lot of other messages but that one stuck out for obvious reasons.   I was SHOCKED  At 7 i didn’t know how to feel because I WAS A CHILD.  But what I didn’t know then but I had been instilled by with that was that words shouldn’t bring you down no matter what anybody says. I am beautiful in every single way.   Now here we are 20 years later and the world is MUCH different.     Mind you, when I heard my first song, social media wasn’t even a thing. And Facebook was invented a year after I googled and watched my first music video.   So things are very different today based on how people judge and beat up on themselves. Well, how about Miss. Aguilera uploaded an updated music video for the 20th anniversary that highlights all of those things that young people may be going through.   Bravo to her for keeping the music and the message up to date.   It’s a different time we’re living in.
I get the general sentiment, but in the end, where are all the conventionally unattractive, fat, disabled, etc. kids living their lives? Seems pretty surface level to me. Unfortunate, because they could have easily made this more diverse with someone with Christina's money backing it. Disappointed overall with the producers, but wishing the best for the kids involved, of course
This hit me. I am literally laying here with a glass of water and diet pills next to my bed.
and I just learned about this now!!!
Christina heard that the heroine chick was coming back and she said NOT IN MY WATCH
As an artist, Christina Aguilera is awesome, not only because of her voice.
20 años después y sigo emocionándome al escuchar esta canción.
♥️
SUBTITLES!!!! But yes, this is great
Tell me why I just 😢😢😢😢😢😢
Absolutely beautiful 💜💓💗💞
still a great song the nostalgia is real.
Thank you, Christina.
I honestly don’t want to bring children into the world as it is now
GOOSEBUMPS!! I’ve always loved the song and I’m so glad it was re-released in the society we are in.
<3
its a good message to send any time
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
chills! This song is a piece of art
I cant take her serious when her face is full of fillers
LOVE THIS IS MUSIC BEAUTIFUL WONDERFUL 🎧🎧🎧🎧🎤🎤🎧🎵🎶🎶🎶🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🎼🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️
BEAUTIFUL MUSIC
Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.  Matthew 11: 28-30
Vengan a mí todos ustedes que están cansados y agobiados, y yo les daré descanso. Carguen con mi yugo y aprendan de mí, pues yo soy apacible y humilde de corazón, y encontrarán descanso para su alma. Porque mi yugo es suave y mi carga es liviana.  Mateo 11: 28-30
Vinde a mim, todos os que estais cansados e oprimidos, e eu vos aliviarei. Tomai sobre vós o meu jugo, e aprendei de mim, que sou manso e humilde de coração, e encontrareis descanso para a vossa alma.  Mateus 11: 28-30
Finally a song that shows how shitty our world has been .
I saw Sofia from my school there
Incrível, como antes! Um hino! ❤️🎤🎹🎶
Funny enough she added to the problem. Pop doll.
Me encanta lloré como una bebé. Gracias Christina❤️
This song now make more sense than ever!!
This video made me cry. The song is as strong now as it was when it first came out, but the social media aspect for children and teenager made this so much more poignant.
Esta muy bueno el video pero creo que falto la homosexualidad como en el video original de hace 20 años
♥️♥️♥️
Oh my God
I'm really happy with this song i always wanted to have straight hair full face of makeup new body new everything but i remebered by this song who i was and what i was missing thank you Christina
The bleeding phone is soooo good
this was a powerful song when it was first released, but this new video brings it's bang on point again. Nicely done. With social media such a huge influence in kids lives, to look/present a certain way, these video is so powerful. It can be hard to embrace the real you sometimes, but stand proud, you are beautiful the way you are. You are loved. live life!
Oh my God, this video made me ugly cry. My daughter is 12, and tells me she feels like the odd one out in her class for not having a phone. It just doesn't feel right for her to be a part of the online world yet, and this video reinforced that belief for me.
they even made it in liminal spaces
I'm not trying to bring down our Queen but the new approach for the video seems a little bit off knowing that Christina herself has done some not so natural changes.
Beautiful song and lyrics ❤
Perfect timing as we see the toxic 2000 body culture making its way back… these poor babies don’t deserve to cycle through the same things we did.
Cried
Are people actually buying this?? Celebrities are the WORST when it comes to have NORMAL standards. I hate it when they make music videos like this when the celebrities THEMSELVES are wearing the make up, having the surgeries and having the muscles from money, free time and plastic surgery….stop making songs/videos about being ok with what you look like when you fall into the normal celebrity trap…:can’t we ever have a normal looking person be an idol??
I can relate to the girl dreaming of breast implants. I spent my whole youth feeling less of a woman for being flat but now at 44 my breasts have grown bigger and I can even wear a cleavage and feel confident.
We re beatiful people💅
Dá pra curtir mil vezes?
It's a message that this generation needed, too 🥺❤️
You have almost fixed the society of the world 2022! This is so inspirational! 🧡🥹🥹
Thanks for this ❤️🥲
Modernity sucks. Tech sucks. Our overlords are evil.
Dont you bring me down today. ❤
We are beautiful no matter what they say ❤️❤️❤️
Christina Aguilera. One of the most reputable and respected classics, beautiful lyrics, beautiful voice that touches soul deep down. This song will live forever, it’s a legacy
Unbelievable that the comments are on despite the number of children in the video.
yes I love it
Wow. Brought me to tears. I was a pretty confident kid and I still (wrongly) thought I needed to lose weight as a young teen. And that was without social media. My 11 year old daughter rants and rages at me that I took away her TikTok and electronics, but I hope one day she'll thank me.
wondering why she didn't showcase any LGBTQ or physically disabled folks... not hating, really enjoyed this, just would have loved to see myself represented there and i didn't. besides that, a beautiful song that meant a lot to me in high school. she's got a killer voice!
cringe
Wow.. ironi dari awal lagu ini muncul hingga sekarang adalah perbedaannya arti beautifull itu sendiri. Berawal dari kemunculan sosial media. orang2 menjustifikasi identitas mengenai kecantikan, kurus, tirus, kulit putih dan hal2 semacam itu, mereka menilai dari media sosial, jumlah like, dan komen. Dan semakin berkurangnya hati nurani dan lupa untuk bahagia. Mereka lupa bahwa sosial media HANYA MENAMPILKAN KELEBIHAN KAMU SAJA. Ya, saya termasuk pernah menjadi korban bullying. Dan saya cantik. Orang2 bodoh itu tidak punya hati nurani dan kecantikan di wajah mereka.
Te quiero mucho Cristina Aguilera❤❤❤❤😘😘😘😘
누군가를 염탐하면서 흠모하게 되면서 닮아가기를 바라거나 혹은 같아지려는 풍조를 잘 비난한 예술이네요 다양성과 개성을 존중하자는 의미로 한글로 작성합니다.
<3
Best music video for this song. So important! They should play this at school for the children. Poor little ones. Life is so hard for them.
Christina is so plastic fake, full of fillers, Botox, and plastic surgery and has the audacity to still push this song. 🤣🤣 she should live by her own words.
Yes. My heart needed this. There is hope
Omg waouw
❤
2:08 -- Kim K, is that you?
Why is the teenage boy staring at a razor??
christina was there when my mom wasn't
awww that was cringe bestie.
did anyone else think it ended like an DHMIS video?
The voice reminds me of Melanie Martinezs video for ms potato head 💔
Love this version!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Omg the old version was so much better :(
couldn't be more accurate
I got covered in goosebumps when they all screamed.
This video broke me. YOU ARE ALL BEAUTIFUL I PROMISE. PLEASE BELIEVE ME. 🥺✨
Dang, Tina. You go girl.
Still the most beautiful song of 2002 AND 2022. What a voice, so much impact. I listened to it back then over and over again and reliving it again now.
I’m also curious to know how many of these actors behind these scenes posted to their social media accounts talking about being on the set of this video. The irony. 20 years later from now, the Metaverse version. Love the message and this version, but unfortunately our devices have become an appendage. The only way to stop this is if the 1% cut us off, or if all of our the satellites get destroyed.
Thank you Christina.
Thank you.  It's needed and timely.
lyrics still relevant to this day
Wie wundervoll 🥰
Thank you so much ❤
Thank you, Linda and Christina, for this life-affirming song. It meant so much when it was released, but with the renewed and amped-up hate toward people who just want to be themselves, it's needed even more today.
I love the song - the video is so perfect - thank you so much.
I was really excited about this then I remembered what Christina did to her own face...nevermind smh
We struggled with this back in 2002, but must be way more difficult for teens today in this society….it’s sad
Wow. Powerful all over again. ❤
Thank you Christina 🥲🥲
This brought tears to my eyes. We needed this rerelease. Thank you
Currently crying
♥️
😊❤️
What a message...💔
20 years ago this CLASSIC, FEMINIST,  LGBTQ AND WHATEVER else this video and song stands for  still today resonates and makes a huge impact. A Grammy winning song... LIFE CHANGING LYRICS , A LIBERATING POWERFUL ANTHEM FOR ALL OF US.   THE NEW VIDEO IS SO APT IN REGARDS TO how young people of Today live their lives, create their apprentices on what they see and hear on social media and the SO called Instagram Facebook tick tok Twitter influencer.    Live ur life And ur heart   with a humble and loving way of life. Lotsa love  Richie from south Africa
Fckn hell i couldn’t even get to half of it without crying…
*ATEMPORAL*
Thank you for releasing this again. Time for change! I am proud of us for speaking up and being brave enough to not tolerate the negative influences of social media, I pray we all become more self loving ❤
Shoutout to everybody who 20 years later, still hasn't got it all figured out
New movement, “taylors version “
This song is needed more than ever now that social media is everywhere.  If you're a kid, tween, or teen reading this comment, please remember that people only put the best of the best up on social media and they play with photo editors and filters. Never, EVER, compare yourself to anybody on SM.  Also, get out there and EXPERIENCE life, don't just document it.
THIS IS A MATERPIECE
When you don't realize how much you hurt inside, and this song makes you cry your eyes out.
thanks a lot for making me cry
Surprisingly (not) everyone on this video actually looks beautiful and meets today's beauty standards of social media.
So important❤
Un mensaje potente y claro !!!
Gives me Unpretty (TLC) vibes. Love it!
Omg I'm sobbing 😭 😢 uncontrollably!  I remember when this came out and how impacted I was even then. But the kids today are so bombarded my heart sinks for them. Back then it was magazines and we would see it on TV and stuff but these kids see it everywhere online. That they need to look perfect. I love in the end they just reject it and become kids again! We are all uniquely beautiful in our own way and nasty mean words can't bring us down! Love you Christina thanks for this we need ❤️ this even us adults need it too 😊
Oh my god, I needed this song as a depressed, low self esteemed teen. And I'm so glad that it's been reworked so that the current teens can also relate and love themselves. Ugh, this made me cry.
추억 돋네
Where's the closed captioning for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing fans? Please add it on this music video and thank you #CAPTIONTHIS
In 2002 when the Stripped album came out, I was 12 and absolutely obsessed with it. The entire album is a masterpiece from beginning to end. This song has always been SO special but WOW. What a way to bring it back to life for a second time, when we honestly need to hear it’s message more than ever. 🤍 Beautiful
Amazing video - got so teartful whenthe children were outside playing and connecting with each other this is what Childhood should look like!
I think this was even more emotional to watch than 20 years ago when I was a freshman in high school. 😭 I can't imagine having to grow up in the age of social media. Thank you Xtina! ❤️😗🤗
This is what this world needs to understand. Thank you Christina for this video. ❤
I cried so hard
🤧
I hope Christina re-release this song again in 20 years from now, so that my kids can hear the message from this anthem Just like how it was for me now and back in 2002
Wow. I was uhh... Expecting something better? And looking at the comments, I guess I was the only one. The song still slaps, but this video is very ... well. Not good?  One, it seems to be aiming its message almost exclusively at the Daniel Tiger audience? The original spoke more to teenagers and young adults, which made sense as one's concern with their body tends to skyrocket at the age one actually is developing their body, while I don't recall that being as much of a concern for 9-year-olds. Like, this video literally has tiny children getting prepped for facial reconstruction surgery, as if there is some epidemic of elementary grade kids demanding to have face lifts and eye-tucks. Who the fuck is this for?  Secondly, it seems kind of weird that the 2002 version of the video had heavy LGBTQ representation while the 2022 version dismisses their existence? That seems kind of backwards. Given how the original was among the only positive trans representation on television at the time, it seems like at a time when that community is finally being given attention, one would double down on that representation?  Third, the way these tiny children are being directed to hold their phones, makes it appear as if they were instructed by a person who has never held a cellphone before. No one holds a phone that far away from their face for that long. Their arm would get tired. Especially if they have these little string-bean tiny children arms. Also — the bleeding phone at the end? The heavy handed attempts to paint cell phones as this evil little box both makes Christina give off boomer vibes at 41, but also ignores the fact that body dysmorphia and eating disorders have existed long before cell phones (hence the existence of her original video). Everything about this video seems to be from the perspective of someone so old that they can't tell the difference between teenagers and 10-year-olds, that they are incapable of relating to their intended audience and that they have decided that this song is no longer about encouraging those who feel inadequate to love themselves, but rather condemning the existence of technology.  But again. Clearly mine is a lone voice in a sea of praise, so I could be entirely wrong.
❤❤❤
Wow our society needed this song again. An this video OMG!
It is just not the song but the video too. Really hits hard.
Made me tear up when the kids go back to… being kids. So sad that children and teens are so affected by our culture’s fixation with bodies.
Amazing.
I dont get one thing. She is singing this message while being part of the problem, the industry that is celebrating only beauty and is sending this message through the world.
Love u christina! Fuck beauty standards
Very powerful visuals paired with this amazing song… Just Wow!
Subhanallah ❤❤
I'm a teacher now at an all girls school that I used to go to and this made me cry just thinking about the kids I teach and how much pressure they feel to be a certain way or look a certain way. They are amazing kids and I always try to remind them that their physical, emotional and mental health will always be my top priority. I loved this song when it came out but it really got to me now that I see so many teenagers and kids who are becoming aware of their differences at younger and younger ages.
Cringe
Can't believe this song is already 20 years old. Time flies so fast. And this song still everlasting as ever
I love this but Christina Aguilera your costume at the  ‘Dirrty’ Roots for L.A. Pride 2022 makes me question everything now....
Cried watching this video because when I see others struggling with it I always think “they are so beautiful and amazing!!! I wish they didn’t have to feel or think that 😢” but when it comes to me I don’t usually have the same love. What a beautiful message and what amazing videography to just add to the lyrics ❤
Love this since it was released when i was a kid.. still hits hard
“Don’t look at me.”
Muito emocionante 😭 uma obra de arte 👏👏👏
02:58 El despertar de la niña me hizo un nudo en la garganta.
Este vídeo es EXCELENTE con todas sus letras.
Te amo Christina 💕
Definitely cried. Thank you for this rerelease and the message at the end Christina. Amazing❤
Zombie Nation.
This video are for those who feel anxious when posting pictures, self-comparison, and the feeling of inadequacy. You are all beautiful and don't change a thing about yourself. Escape social media.
This is deep Christina. God bless you! Lord please help us to find balance again. 🙏
Wow. That left me speechless. I can't believe its been 20 years. I was 20 years old when this song came out. I have been heartbroken to see the changes as my own young boys are starting to hit tween ages.
THIS VIDEO IS SO POWERFUL. Wow. Heartbreaking yet the mirror we all need right now. I hope this goes viral and effects real world change.
So sad the fact that we are normalizing this behavior.  I am ashamed to see how many kids grow up and are constantly comparing themselves to influencers. I am ashamed to see how many women think its "ok" to do plastic surgery. I am ashamed to see how all humans think about is PHYSICAL APPEREANCE.  It is sad, depressing and dissapointing.
Thank you so much for this. A big big message for this generation
Thanks, we need to speak about this loudly!
From TLC unpretty to Pink stupid girls to Christina Aguilera beautiful there’s always this message of accepting yourself and not get sucked in to the obsession with outside beauty but damn I don’t see the change with people worshipping women like the kardashions who are the opposite of these messages on the songs I mentioned.
Still AMAZING! I'm having trouble writing this because I havent cleared the tears. Beautiful beautiful beautiful video. And love how all the focus is on how kids feel at that age.
This was so needed. Social media will be the death of people and it’s so sad to watch. People guard your kids with your life. They only get one shot at a childhood.
In 2002 I was 11, on the cusp of puberty and starting to have feelings I didn't understand so push them down. I was questioning my sexuality but it was illegal for teachers to "positively promote homosexuality" in schools (Section 28 in the UK which was only repealed in 2003), so even if I wanted to talk to them they weren't allowed to help.  I am now 31 and am happily living as a bisexual trans man, engaged to an amazing man who makes me so incredibly happy. I have volunteered as a youth worker over the last 10 years at various LGBT youth groups. To see them have that support and to support in school, makes me happy and gives me so much hope for the generations that will come after me. Releasing this now, is so powerful.
So powerful 👏🏽
100% needs to change!
wow
NÃO SABIA QUE ESSA MÚSICA ERA TÃO PROFUNDA NESSE PONTO😔😥😮
핸드폰중독?
Bawled.
This version hit me so hard
all races, ethnicities, bodies, hair types etc. are unique and special, and should be treated that way — because we are ALL beautiful people ❤
Sad thing is, it's not just in kids and teens... It affects everyone. Every day we're told we need to look like this or that, we need this or that to be happy, everything is better on the other side, when that isn't true at all
Aw man I never expected this, but oh boy I’m so happy it’s happened🥹🤍
Últimamente, l×s niñ×s están creciendo muy rápido. Emotivo!
I’m curious was this a re-record? Or the same song just a new video
anyone else just thinking of damien from mean girls 💀💀
Thank you so much Christina!
My god, that hit hard
I'm not the biggest fan of Christina's music- it's just not usually my cup of tea, but her voice is mind boggling incredible. And this is one of the most beautiful songs to come out of that era of music imo. Still gives me chills every time I hear it. What an amazing re release, and even more relevant today than 20 years ago.  Christina is unmatched in our generation in her mastery and control of her voice. A true vocal prodigy.
Thank you for this. It made me cry. I'm 40, so I feel so grateful to have grown up without social media. Being a kid wasn't easy, but I can't even imagine what it's like being a kid in today's society.
Literally crying
Wow, stunning, thanks Christina and thanks to your team!
Get the kids off social media and go outside and paly
This is very powerful
Don't look at me
I miss the gay couple kissing seriously. I remember watching it when I was 9 or 10 years old and I always thought „Damn this lady makes awesome music plus show society it’s problems with a mirror and is so open minded“
20 years, still powerful!
❤🤣
It's so sad that the mankind turned to a stupid crowd...
OMG I REALLY LIKE THIS SONG. I just feel like it is a song to remember if you are feeling down
Essa música é poderosa desde sempre, desde o primeiro vídeo clipe. Ele ser relançado neste momento foi incrível. Obrigada mais uma vez, X-tina.
I love this song❤ we are beautiful and amazing in our own way😊
Please, something new, you can afford it
This song makes sense nowadays.
IT MADE ME CRYYYY
I LOVE THIS
I got chills...
Go play kids. Forget the rest.
Loved it back then, loving it now.
What are we teaching our children... 🥺
i love this but i also love how the human species can also be the best they can be.... If people settle for fat weak genes, the human species willl cease to exist
When the kids were shown being kids and climbing the tree and playing outside I had to hold back tears. It feels like a different world from the one I grew up in, and that was merely a decade ago
Great artist
This song hasn't aged at all. It is still so powerfully relevant now as it was then, if not more so (with all the contouring and body altering apps).
Hauntingly beautiful
Classic song amazing message… I hope all you Kardashian loving freaks learn a lesson from this, clearly they didn’t 20 years ago
😍😍😍
this song and who says by selena gomez make me feel so much more confident
This song has always had an amazingly powerful message and so beautiful. However, I wish Christina, and performs like her maybe presented themselves more naturally in the media and public eye, to help spread this message, instead of promoting the "industry standard" that so much children and young adults tend to compare themselves to. It's an amazing song, but I feel like Christina should lead by example, instead of conforming to the problem under all the makeup.
Everyone reading this IS beautiful. ❤️✌🏼
I feel like YouTube is tryna tell me sth with these recommendations
This song is more relevant and needed than ever. Thank you, Christina ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you
Powerful. As a mom of 2 incredible girls, this brought me to tears.
Just reiterating what many have said. This song is such a powerful message. The fact that you put the effort into re releasing it for today's youth means a lot to a lot of people. I hope the right kids are seeing this music video 💕
This song gets to me every time, right in my feels. <3
love how mental health is shown in this one
Didn't she get a lot of plastic surgery done recently? And yet this video seems very anti surgery... Getting mixed messages here. And they hired only pretty people for the video. Always loved the song, but this video falls flat for me.
Maybe AC should quit wearing big dildos and melting people's minds
This message is just as important as it was when it first came out, if not even more so. Love this 💗
Fuerte el final
No more words.. 💖
This song never gets old.
and suddenly it's hard to breathe
there are certain people with cruel vicious hearts and ugly personas that definitely do not deserve this song lol. not everyone is beautiful and that should be okay
powerful song for today's generation
Couldn't help but bawl my eyes out at the end when the kids were playing in the tree. Simply being kids. Now social media robs them of their innocence's and self love.
Got damn it! Now I'm crying at work. 🥲
The 2002 video is more powerful to my taste. But the song is still very relevant. And ofc Christina is amazing always
i've been feeling insecure these past few weeks and when i openend yt, this is the first video that popped up. what a beautiful time to release this song again. let us be reminded that we are all beautiful in every single way. ✨
😭😭😭😭😭
As someone who had an eating disorder, this hits right... I'm sitting here with tears in my eyes remembering all the pain caused by my ed. I'm doing very well now, but thanks for rising awareness <3
Thank you. This was awesome, but it saddened me to see the kids playing outside without their phones.   We are in 2022. This is not our reality anymore. We need to play outside, but it's fine to use our phones there.
When I was a kid eat whatever I like.  When I was in high-school eat whatever was trendy.  When I was in college eat whatever make me beautiful.  When I was beginning of real world eat whatever suit with my salary.  Now eat whatever make me healthy (BUT it is difficult!!!!)
This topic is such necessary.❤
Wow 🤧 so true. This song is more relevant then ever. I hope it helps many kids today like it helped me back then ❤
Thank you for doing this! 🙏 I personally don’t have social media and have a IG for my business, but never got anything out of it and just deactivated it. It was purely just real estate stuff. I do think about my children and their generation growing up in such toxic virtual environments such as social media. For us adults it’s easier to discern what we want to take in and what not, but a young mind that is still developing isn’t fully aware and looking to find out who it is from an immature undeveloped place and by these social projections it really is damaging. I wish they could put more limitations and ban some of those platforms. It really is sad to see.
Great song written by the lead vocalist of 4 Non Blondes!
And yet a kid in a wheel chair looks at all those able bodied people climbing a tree in that happy emancipated ending and feels left out. Now I know not all people can be represented in one video and the original video was mind blowing and controversial and so important and cherished by a lot of people. Yet this was a remake and it was supposedly meant show today's problematic self image problems but I can't help but feel like it was shrunk somehow from the original. 20 years and we still have the same problems if not bigger. And I believe that if you complain about something you should also offer a solution and here is mine: show your body, the next video you make or the next picture you take, don't try to glam it, don't comb your hair, let people see you because they want to #meetyou and maybe Christina can make a new video from those.
ฉันฟังเพลงนี้ตอนม.2 มันทำให้ฉันเชื่อจริงๆว่าทุกคนมีความสวยในตัวเอง มันเป็นเพลงโปรดของฉันมาก ขอบคุณจริงๆ
i love all the lyrics in this song, it's remains me just be myself and don't compare my life journey with anyone ❤
Love you Christina and the team whose idea it was to release this
Unpretty by TLC carries a similar message - believing you’re not worthy because you don’t live up to someone else’s unrealistic beauty standards rather than trusting in your own sense of self-worth based on self-love
Did you find at least one asian boy or guy, lesbian couple, non-binary person, transgender person in this video? I didn't. So is this just performative? 🤔
this song was in youtube 13 years ago and was sang in 2022 13 days ago
i never wear makeup and i never get complimented on that
뿌잉 감동이잖아 😭
That is powerful!
Social media sucks
Hhhhhhhhh🥹🥹🥹🥹
I love that you’ve done this. ❤
I am in TEARS
Thank you !
4million
💔💔❤‍🩹❤‍🩹
so much love for this video and message - we all deserve to feel accepted just the way we are ❤
💖💖💖💖💖
20 years later and this song is still wonderful and giving me goosebumps every time I listen to it, Christina's vocals on this song are stunning and elevates the emotion conveyed. Really Timeless 😍😍💓💓 Christina was very smart and brave to have released this song back then in 2000 💓 It was a game changer and a beautiful incentive to fight for rights, in 2002 I was only 5 years old and didn't understand the message, I just enjoyed and loved this song a lot , and around the age of 10 to 12 I could understand the message that the music conveyed, and I started listening to music with a different mindset. I came to love much more, and have a great affection for this song and for Christina 😍🥰 Today, at 25, I realize how our children and adolescents need our support and love more than ever, they are a generation that is totally connected and different from ours, attention with them must be redoubled 🥰🥰
Girl has amazing pipes. Glad she's finally doing real music
So real
I never like her dreadlocks in the original release
Crazy how nothing really changes. I was thinking how this is more relatable now than back when I was 11. But even when I was 11, it was just as bad. No one gets nicer. Everyone’s insecure and hateful no matter where you go or what time/era. It’s all about making sure you love yourself and know you’re okay when others think you’re not.
watching this music video really touched me and made me cry, kids can be so brutal and I regret something stupid I said in 5th grade to a girl about her chest, how her's aren't like mine, picking her out, because I experience body image issues all the time, I have a soft face, my belly is soft, and I feel as if I have to change a lot of the time a lot about my appearance, and i do spend a lot of screen time scrolling and constantly comparing myself to others. it has me crying at night, the stuff this generation has been through, and the way social media is impacting a lot of kids at a young age. I am 14, I see this in me, and younger kids. I loved this heartwarming video, I never actually heard the song but then I recognized it and it moved my soul. thank you, I love the 90s! and this was a very great message. showing this to my grandmother and my little sister💗💖💕this was a great music video, I loved it.
Wow, I’m super impressed with this. Everything about it. Thanks for releasing this and for helping communicate a real message at an important time
I love me
CONTA TACO DE OJO ISRAEL
Thank you for showing that guys struggle with this too!!
I've lived with body dysmorphia, an undiagnosed eating disorder, and mental health issues all my life. I was constantly told as a child that I was too big, too loud, too imperfect. I didn't have social media growing up but have kids now and see how hard it is to keep my kids from the negative messaging. It's not just social media that needs to change. It's the messaging around perfection and beauty and diet culture. We need to change the conversations.
this was incredible and so necessary
thank you
Christina I grew up listening to you and your powerful women energy and I’m so thankful for you and your songs. I’m 30 now and I sang this song with anxiety in front of my class and felt empowered and emotional. I now have a 11 week old who I can empower and teach her to love herself no matter what 🥹 I am in tears writing this to you! Lots of love from me xxx
This should be on tv instead of some stupid show
This is the best reminder for everyone ❤️
I really truly appreciate this rerelease and the video! I am a bit disappointed with the lack of body size diversity save for one particular scene. As a child who was bigger than her peers, never being represented positively (or at all) in media sent me and others the message that my size was not welcome. That said, I know the video can never be perfect for every viewer. Please continue with this amazing message and important work! ❤️
❤
Everybody needs this song in there life 😔
4 millones. ❤
This song is more relevant nowadays more than when it was released
Reading about how powerfull the song was for many people here - reminds me how powerfull the musicvideo of "dirty" was for me in my teen years. And i know i was not the only one lol
Struggling with acne all my teenage years and now in adulthood, and seeing acne showed for the first time in a video was very powerful to me. Thank you
the fact its still so powerful and i have goosebumps....
CHRISTINA AGUILERA the world needed this SO much. Thank you for re-sharing this already powerful song, with such an important, impactful, *essential* warning message.
Nice new video for 2022
Amazing message and video but CA is surgery queen is she not?
man i was doing so good at not being emotional today but you broke my streak.
So, this is targeting kids, so I'm going to direct this to them: Dear kids, you can be whatever you want, but don't let ANYONE tell you being fat is ok. Being fat is NOT ok. I am not talking about aesthetics, I am talking about health. I am an obese person and I've been struggling with this for decades. IT IS NOT OK TO BE FAT and anyone who tells you that it is is either lying or doesn't know what their talking about. Be whatever you want, whoever you want, but above all be HEALTHY.
Very true.
Slay
❤
I'm glad this addresses body confidence issues in males, too. bravo.
20 years ago I was turning 18, and struggling with my body image back then. Now, I'm turning 38, have 2 young children, and this song still hits hard, maybe harder now I have kids of my own and will watch them go through the social media gamut in the future.
The updated version I didn't know I needed 💜
u got me crying. AGAIN!!! Thank You. So. Much. ♥️❤️‍🩹♥️🌈
(Not Bill)  Good effort, except, all the young people in the video were beautiful.  So, where were the plain and less than plain youth.  The ones that really needed the message?  Where were the rest of us?
This is so touching and beautiful! Back in the 1970s, I had a little girl wanting big boobs and a makeup problem. My mom always called me ugly. I  fought that hard and emerged victorious. I am strong, fit, and healthy. In my late twenties, I decided that I wouldn't paint my face ever again. I am proud to be what I see in the mirror. Now that I'm getting older, I have to fight the problem at the other end of the tunnel. Again, I won't let the world or my mom's old words tell me that I'm ugly. I'm beautiful, important, and kind. We all can be if we allow ourselves to be.
Reminds me of TLC’s Unpretty.
delete it all! This song is still powerful. This version is so apropos in today's society.
That was kinda disturbing
Love this timeless message 💕
Cool the new video version but, can’t you make hits again? 🧐🧐🤣
😍
The bodybuilder is the best example of beauty in this video. Showing that beauty comes from hard work. The goal is not to achieve the look of the bodybuilder but rather working hard towards something transforms you into a strong (and beautiful) person inside and out.
Loved this! What a great message
Beautiful video, this is so very needed
🥲🥲🥲🥲
Don't look at me Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is? You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side 'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
This should have more views !
I wish I had this video as a teen. It would have helped a lot to listen to every time my mother criticized my genetic appearance. I and my husband have body dismorphic disorder (I was diagnosed with it over a decade ago) so mirrors can be a struggle, but songs like this help cope with it. It's horrifying to think that social media is creating it or making those with pre-existing conditions worse. 😰  We need more songs and videos like this, but I'm grateful to every artist that has made more uplifting music to help everyone.
Most powerful video now….can’t wait till it get taken down for fatphobia or some bs like that. 😒
😍😍
I love that the video was redone to reflect Instagram influencer culture.
hermoso
Thank you Christina!! You're beautiful!! 💖 Hugs from Mexico. 🇲🇽🤗
Sitting at school in the teacher's lounge and stumbled across this! Wow! SUCH a powerful and important message.
This is the FIRST song I thought of and showed my daughter when she was feeling down about how she looked. This hits so hard and sends such a beautiful message to everyone and one of my absolutely favorite song of all time! Still makes me cry when I hear it and helped my daughter gain the confidence and courage about herself. Thank you Christina for the beautiful message that everyone needs at points in their life. Just wonderful.
More important than ever!! THANKS FOR RE-RECORDING. A collaboration with JAX would be the greatest! 🙇🏼‍♀️💫🙌🏼 Stay healthy everyone ♡
Himno 🙌👏
Kylie Jenner is what I think on this video...maybe all of the Kardashians
Does no one else think it’s wrong to have little girls in latex bikinis? No? Just me? K…. And does no one else realize Christina is feeding into the bs social/beauty constructs she’s trying to break down in the video? Ugh.   PS don’t let your kids have cell phones or access to social media!!!
This is amazing and powerful message. check up on your kids don’t let them drown with TikTok and social media let kids be kids. 💯🙏🏻 blessings to everyone and remember the less social media the better
The song is great. There's no doubt about it...But Christina is not the one to critizice surgeries when she has MANY in her own face. Come on.
The worst is the transgender reasigment for kids, they should be shielded from this.
thank you so much...
You're beautiful Christina! Thank you for this song back then and now!!!
Wait until 8th sent me here.  20 years ago my body issues came from media (tv, movies, magazines)  It’s more so today.  #waituntil8th  #letthembelittle  #delaysocialmedia
Qué importante que se visualize esto!!!!
I love how no one sees the irony in Christina herself having a shit ton of plastic surgery, lol. What a hypocrite.
Good video aside from pushing a young man into an allusion to same sex relationships. ( this coming from a gay married dude myself.)
OMG still relevant more than ever
This song is now more relevant than ever.
Such a fantastic song and a great message. The video really captures how todays social media pressures us to perfect ourselves when perfection is an illusion
How relevant to re-release this song music video in this year lately 🥹 makes me wanna cry
cool message but what I feel is missing is actual people who are considered ugly or normal looking to take part in projects like this.
I appreciate how inclusive this video is and the acknowledgment that young men are also influenced by social media culture.
The fact that the new mv is full of children is so heartbreaking. We as a society have gone in the wrong direction.
Linda Perry appreciation
Where are all the marginalized bodiez….?? All the kids are the same size and shape, with barely any variation…. Who is supposed to relate to this??
we are beautiful ❤️
Great, but maybe is more important for girls (and boys) see you more without make up and doing "sexy" moves, that objectify women. More true actions and not just x-washing.
Not only in teens. The beauty pressure is at all ages . That’s why a lot of people get beauty cirugy done and can’t stop even if they see their body is changing
even now this song brings a tear to my eye.
Just simply beautiful
Bonjour, je suis Française. Je découvre ce clip sur les conseils de quelqu'un . J'ai pleuré. Merci.
Save 🇰🇷🇺🇦
No such thing as kids playing outside these days. Not how I remember things back when I was a child. With the technology that the newer generation's have, childhood almost doesn't exist anymore. It's unfortunate and sad. They're too busy wanting to be grown. If they only knew, once you're grown all you wish for is the peace and freedom that comes with being a kid.
This particular album helped me through a lot when I was going through my teenage years. Totally inspiring. Made me aware that we should all love the uniqueness we possess as individuals.  That everyone has their own beauty and that no one should tell us otherwise. Truly the most empowering artist I've looked up to since I was young.
I feel so sorry for kids having to grow up with social media shoved down their throats every day. Like during those early, definitive years. Kids shouldn't have to worry about how they look, they should be able to grow up without that crap. This video is so needed in 2022 <3
Thank you Christina! I am a young trans woman! EVERYONE! is BEAUTIFUL! inside and out!💜🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
Ugh. This got me 🥺😭

One of The Most Meaningful Songs of All Time
❤️😭
This is for my twenty. You're beautiful 이미 충분했단다
20 years later, and You're still trying to make your point. So sad we haven't learned anything as society
😥😭 again
Versión actualizada 👏🏽🥰 me encanta
Let kids be kids!
The two guys hugging and supporting each other was so deep... thank you for this! We guys need to support each other more and open ourselves more! We've been too uptight and not taking care of ourselves or our loved ones. We need to change this
wow
The original is still my favorite…
Wow... this was so touching. Absolutely beautiful! I am speechless. Bravo !
Ironic when we think about Aguilera's surgeries...
fits this world exactly, fucked up
Its perplexing to me why Christina isn't huge on the music scene. She's so totally underrated and absolutely phenomenal.
I'm a millennial. I've tried to attain the perfect body and face my entire life, and it's gotten me a suicide attempt, eating disorder, no friends or lasting bf, and a warped sense of beauty. NO boy or girl should EVER have to think they aren't beautiful or worthy and I hate hate hate that we have basically no laws protecting them when it comes to what is real and what is fake on social media. Something drastic needs to be done. Companies prey on the vulnerable at the expense of thier mental health as long as it makes them tons of money. It makes me sick.
👏👏👏
i spent my whole school life listening to aguilera’s songs the best singer in my life❤
the ending was interesting. i interpreted the song as seeing inner beauty, not self-image. but i guess that is tied to inner beauty, obviously.
lol says go to her page, get there and it's the most photoshopped image of her, making u scroll through promotions to get to generic mental health websites
I remember when i first heard this song, I had tears rolling down my face. I always would sing along to this song at my lowest points. Its been about 20 years since then, and it makes me so happy to know this was re-released. Truly a song everyone needs to hear
Omg 😭
Oh how boring life would be if we were all the same 😔😢 Being yourself is your super power!  ❤❤❤❤
I’m sitting here and i cry. Hitting So hard.
fantastic then, fantastic now
realmente estamos escrav0s da tecnologia. meu Deus que video incrivel
The definition of timeless❤
Still listening to this in October 2022!!!
its chilling because the older original version had older kids. now they're younger...
Terrifyingly accurate video. Well done for the update.
Omg Soooooo good ❤
amazing re-release, the message doesn't need to be more straight forward. Don't shield kids from internet and judgement but build their self-esteem so that they can rise above it together
20 years ago, this song was more directed to adults and their struggle with their body image and themselves, today it is obviously directed to the children. The situation is worse than we think.
Shout out to XTina for this! And China McClain for her amazing version of the song! Love it to this day! 😭
This is such a powerful video I hope more people get to see it!
Beautiful and powerful
Listened to Christina Aguilera my whole childhood and I just love what she stands for. She’s so underrated. I love her so much! ❤️❤️❤️
Chorei! ❤️
I´m sobbing. I remember watching the original music video as a young teen, crying and screaming in the bathroom. I developed an eating disorder in the early 2000s. Now I work with youths and mental health and it breaks my heart to see where we as a society are heading. So many children and teens struggle, the numbers are only increasing. It´s heartbreaking. This is a BEAUTIFUL music video and it´s sadly even more fitting now than when the song was first released. Thank you Christina.
So incredibly powerful, I hope it reaches those it needs to and that they find the strength to ask for help. ♥
Tja wilkommen in der jetzigen Gesellschaft. Jeder mensch ist schön auf seine Weise und das vergessen viele..
Wow, what a video!
im not crying you are
It was honest before Christina drastically changed her look. After that and with this video? Sadly not so much
Being 23 now, this song hits me far more than I expected it to them when I heard the first version of the song. I know the songs are the same and it’s the music videos that are different, but being an adult in this environment can be so toxic and this music video was what I needed today.❤
I love how most extras are phisically unlikely to feature in a TV commercial...even freckles are frowned upon by the sick industry nowadays or hidden with filters...  😴
This was emotional 😢
nah im ugly lol
Beautiful song. But what does Christina really know about inner beauty if she is also the one who is not insecure, botox, plastic surgeries and etc? This is a song from an insecure person teaching other people to be secure? Maybe because it's not that easy? It's maybe more complex then a song)
VIDEAZO, GRAN MENSAJE
This song should play on every radio stations, every school across the world and every community! We need to spread the message! I'm now playing it to my class at full volume hoping to share with them the msg of this song and i think me being a teacher this is what i ought to do ☺️ It's good to see students embracing their true self rather than a fake image portrayed by social media !
Love the message.  Hope it resonates with the younger generation.  But also hope it finally drives home to Christina too.  She needs to stop messing with her face and body too.  It's perfectly natural to age and for your weight to fluctuate.  Sometimes, we're our own worst critic.
thank you!
simply one of the most beautiful, deep and necessary videos of the century. gonna show it to my niece right now! i want her to know she is beautiful in every single way.
I would love Christina and Britney done a duet. Like Mariah and Whitney. I was thinking they could do love can build a bridge. X
I can’t watch this all the way through because it’s too real for me
Amazing
True video
Recuerdos, muchos recuerdos
The internet ruined everything for us… Now we are ashamed we don’t look like fully developed adults..
Let children be children!
que obra linda ♥

this is a BEAUTIFUL masterpiece! <3
Por?

Me divorcio?
This reflected all the grief I have been feeling the past years for the coming generations. Beautiful message ❤
How alfafentanilo devastated América eeuu
This song was so impactful to me as an insecure teen. Young people today need the message even more with all the pressures and unrealistic expectations of social media. For anyone reading this, YOU are beautiful, and no harmful words from bullies will ever change that.
this is so beautiful im crying
5 seconds in and I am already lovin it!
A beautiful tribute 20 years on and important message. We are the change ❤
👏👏👏👏👏
this is what timeless really means
Beatiful ❤
LOVE YOUR BODY AS IT IS. LOVE YOURSELF NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY!!!
Wow, this is genius,  this is exactly what needs to be shown everywhere.
Damn, I hate how this is needed
amo la letra y la intención, igual pienso que está faltando diversidad en tamaños corporales... y me resulta esencial en esta realización.
I was an 11-year-old at that moment. I continue struggling but this song makes me feel pretty. Thank you for this <3
Christine releasing this 20 years ago was brave.
I agree with everything here, might I add for parents, that bad body image of ourselves also adds to bad body image in our children. It's very much a learned behavior. You learning to love your body can help your child ^_^
Too bad Christina doesn't believe in her own words
This makes me cry so much and think “how could we as people let this happen”. To many of us it was so clear even back then how wrong this was even then. This song helped me through a lot when I was younger as I was a teen when it was first released. But how can we be here in 2022 when if anything it’s only gotten worse. How could we as a society let that happen and just live with that like nothing wrong was done
Thank you for reminding us. I needed this. You're a legend xtina
I love this song.
Letra:   Don't look at me  Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed  I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today  To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?  You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today  No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes  And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side  'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
Such a beautiful ending when the kids are playing outside. Wrapping out kids in cotton wool and fearing for their safety forced them indoors and got them addicted to social media. Now they're in a different kind of danger that parents can't control because they have no idea what their kids are watching or what influencers they're comparing themselves to
So hard and so real! the aesthetic violence is pretty real and we should guide kids to process and filter all the content that it's out there.
I was the girl at 0:57 ... got the surgery and hated it, removed implants after 3 years and finally go to accept and love myself just as I am... like her I had a Pinterest board with tons of photos of models as "body goals"...they all looked exactly as the ones the girl had on the walls. I'm in a very happy place now but I still feel sad because my little nieces are like the girls on the blue latex outfits and I know that what the future holds for them is going to be SO hard 😔
song is more relevant these days than ever. but video could have been more powerful though.
OMG!!! Xtina!!!! Your are DA ONE!!! You saved my life in 2002 (bullying against my body) with this song and hope you can save other lives with this release. Love you so much girl! <3 You are part of my history. Thank you for this song. I am beautiful no matter what they say.
Yes, this song is important for today toxic society and lifestyle.  Thank you Christina and team for this release.
The realness of this video👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾let kids be kids & having fun not stressing over beauty..social media definitely changes things.......(grown ups need to hear/see & understand this too) love me some xtina🥰👏🏾👏🏾
wow this is a really beautiful music video
WOW! Beautiful song with an even more powerful video message
I don’t like videos without the damn artist in it🤷🏾‍♀️
It reminds me of gina XD
Amazing ❤️❤️❤️
now and then, still rules
I wish you would sing a song without always yelling ...
We need to admit and care ourselves(I know it is so difficult to do). If you be nice to yourself, you can be kind to people that you are surrounded. We know it is kind of the ideal but we can have the power to make the  ideal into reality at the same time.
We need this song in 2022 more than ever and we will forever need it.
Chills! Literal chills! This is amazing! ❤ thank you xtina!
Goosebumps!🔥
🥹🥹🥹🥹 this world ist so sick and Christina make a good Job with this Song and Video 👏👏👏👏👏
😭💝
Thank you Christina for releasing Stripped again. This is very timely. It's saddening to meet so many young people who are struggling with their mental health because of body image issues. I hope your message reaches them far and wide, across the world.
how sad that when they released this song then, it was about accepting how we all were different in every way, and now with today's society, it is an entirely context..
Qué buena canción
No fat representation? No transgender representation? Missed opportunity.
old version is better imo
They need us to be beautiful because they are not satisfied with their beauty.
It's the real reason why we want to survive....... We need a change a lot of change...!
Hy I'm from Indonesia.  Di Indonesia standart kecantikan yg digunakan luar biasa 😂, lelah jika mengikuti standar tersebut. Belum lagi kini role model banyak org Indonesia adalah K-Wave😉. So . . mari bersyukur bahwa kita semua trlahir cantik!
this video couldnt have been done better
What a work of art. Inspiring. ❤
I'm so insecure today and this song came up OMG THANK YOU I NEED TO HEAR THIS♥️♥️♥️♥️
Kids are growing up too fast and influenced by all this crap around them yet they always seem to be the target audience. Great message, let's leave the kids alone💔
yeah, that's it! Loved it also, I remembered that Meta research that found out women and teens are the most negatively affected ones by "social" media. They know it, yet they prey on people's mental health
Thank you for sharing the truth.
wowee when this was released in 2002 i was --7 years old, how the time sure flies 🥲👍
We had a lot of hope for the internet at the early times we've had it but somehow we've managed to f'd it up and now here we are with a lot of people looking for validation for some internet points.
this is amazing, i cried my eyes out. thank you for your art, xtina❤
slayed
In the world of social media where everyone is perfect beautiful and flawless,, looking at it everyday makes u feel ugly asf,, i think this song is so perfect to open our minds to embrace our individualities.
If our kids think that taking their own life or self harm are viable options, then we need to do better and be better.  No one has ever died from not having social media, many have died from having it, think about that people.  This has always been a powerful song and hits very hard today.
I'm loving artist remastering their masterpieces. Same meaning that goes with the new generation.
Powerful.
Listen, I love this song. And I love Christina's powerful and incredible voice. But redoing the subject matter of the music video when she herself has had a lot of noticible plastic surgery/fillers put in, doesn't make much sense? I don't know, I guess just practice what you preach?
Thank you for the new video to an always brilliant song - perfectly embodies the need for everyone to love themselves as they are. <3
This is SO important. Thank you Christina. This is what music is about ❤
Hermoso mensaje, me encanto!
Awesome content.
wow this was beautiful
I remember this meaning so much to me as a kid constantly being bullied for my psoriasis and weight.... so its sad that the supposed solution in this music video is my childhood nightmare.
I get the message and it's powerful, but I can't support a video that paints the gym in such a bad light. Working out can be such a great thing and a video about being beautiful shouldn't put down people who work out because we struggle with our self-image as well. We are also victims of to own minds as well. And the stereotypical girl/ surgery troupe has already been talked about by everyone and their mom. Most people with self-image problems are not in that category and probably deserved to be included much more. Overall lazy attempt and an easy way out.
🤩💕
I was crying when i first listen to this song 20 years ago. And i cry again as is it's the first time I'm listening to this song
que pisão dona aguilera, hino pro povo lgbtqia+
I'm crying at this moment
This is still my power up song when I am sad
Yes very fitting indeed....need to stop encouraging kids to change the   body they are born in with puberty blockers and gender affirming surgeries.
This just needs fat or chubby ppl in it
This is amazingly very relative to our society right now.
The best and the most meaningful music video that was made these couple of  years.....
How I love this wonderful... crying a lot here with joy.
Kids from nowadays 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
POWER TO THE POWERLESS
❤️
Ni cliche
I agree with everyone in the comments. Song hit so hard when it came out and hits just as hard if not harder today. Directly in the heart, such a powerful message! Thank you Christina. To anyone reading this I love you very much and none of us are alone, and we’re all worth it!
Loved it
I was 13 in 2002 when this first came out and it still hits hard. As someone who still struggles with self-esteem, this is so needed.  Thank you Christina for rereleasing it 🙏🏽.
Yes we are all beautiful
Let's tell the kids since they are babies (even if it sounds weird, it is not) how beautiful, important, wonderful and capable they are. Word and thoughts, our mind, they are more important and powerful than people think. Here in Spain there is a famous doctor who has make surgeries without chemical anestesy, for more than 40 years and 0% infection, wellbeing in postsurgery etc.. he says, if u can do this and set anestesy in ur body im seconds by thinking it amd saying it imagine how u can change your life, behaviour, health, selfsteem.... You have the Power or should get it, and use this to educate confidence kids, who know they can do whatever. Dont tell them "you are not intelligent enough to study that" "domt say u are beautiful it is disgusting" "money is hard to earn" no please, u are creating their reality and prpyecting ur fears in them, so if they think that, they will have that. The same life of misery maybe than their parents had or whatever. Love them and let them know they deserve to be loved, respected, capable of whatever ...
😮‍💨 triste réalité, s'accepter tels que nous sommes , nous ne sommes pas parfait mais nous avons beaucoup d'amour en nous <3
It’s a bit ironic version coming from a singer who had quite a few plastic surgery… very good version though
Awesome
Beautiful song makes miss my wife even more
El mensaje me resultó genérico, un poco exagerado, y encima los actores que elijieron son todos lindos y normativos. Dá igual la raza o el color, todos son atractivos. Incluso, los que tienen un poco mas de peso corporal, aparecen en planos secundarios o de perfil. Al final el video tiene mucho de eso que intenta criticar. Los que realmente no tienen una belleza normativa, se van a sentir peor, porque ni siquiera se parecen a los actores de un video que intenta motivarlos.
2 seconds in. 2 seconds in and the reason why she re released this song and why this generation needed this became very apparent. I hope they find a little love, acceptance and peace from it just like we did.
Thank you for this re_realease ❤️
Breaks my heart to see so many people saying that the song they needed as a teen 20 years ago, is needed by their teen today. Hard to believe nothings really changed, and some may even say has gotten worse. When will we stop pressurising young people, or inventing things that pressure them and just leave them be?
Somos hermosos en todos los sentidos, las palabras no nos pueden derivar... (⁠ ⁠◜⁠‿⁠◝⁠ ⁠)⁠♡
RIP Noel Gruber </3333
THE QUEEN NEVER LEFT US ❤👑
Everyday is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful No matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes words can't bring me down Oh no So don't you bring me down today Do I have friends? You're delirious So consomed In all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The piece is gone Let the puzzle undone by the way it is You are beautiful No matter what they say Words can't bring you down Oh no You are beautiful In every single way Yes words can't bring you down Oh no So don't you bring me down today No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) With the song beside the tone (Yeah) You are beautiful the space And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always be shining (The sun will always be shining) We'll be at the side Cuz we are beautiful No matter what they say Yes words won't bring us down (Oh) We are beautiful In every single way Yes words can't bring us down (Oh no) So don't you bring me down today (Oh) Don't you bring me down today Don't you bring me down today
Beautiful 💕 👍....and yes, you are
It changes when we decide to STOP using social media.  I'm so happy I grew up before all this started and  even in the first stages of it all (myspace, AOL, livejournal) because it wasn't serious, it wasn't EVERYWHERE, and you didn't have it in the palm of your hand 24/7.    LET'S GET BACK TO THAT
I couldn't fully appreciate this song until now. It always seemed like some basic surface level "love yourself" message, and now it makes me cry
Kids need to hear this because growing up with social media where they encourage plastic surgery is just so terrible. Beauty comes from within.
Imagine having such a timeless massage that you can re-release it UNCHANGED 20 years later and still have such a profound impact. This is legendary.  and in the same breath it is an unfortunate reality of the progress we still need to make in todays world. 💜♥💕
why does this song ALWAYS makes me tear up? Even 20 years later...
20 years later and the message is ABSOLUTELY needed.
This is so powerful oh my god
❤️
very valuable... again ♥
I dont need to hear a song about being beautiful from a Hollywood puppet who set the standard of beauty and make young people hate and kill themselves. fk off xtina
Por desgracia hoy las frivolidades y la vanidad es un tema de cada día, miles de personas diciendo "amor propio" pero no se aman a si mismas, seamos felices como somos y tengamos amor propio antes de divulgar la misma frase❤️💕
where’s black ppl and fat dudes????
This song is for every generation, regardless of age.
Such a powerful pairing, a fitting music video for today’s society for a song that will probably never not be relevant.  I’d like to also thank you for not showing any disordered eating or self harm but rather referencing it. I’m fed up of people showing them possibly triggering people for shock value.  Thank you for highlighting issues in this society while also being sensitive to those who may be suffering. Thank you so much.
Pretty versus happy. Money may or may not buy happiness but pretty can't buy happiness. I am ugly and happy.
stop tryna be grown
That s a beautiful message
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yes christina
📝🙃❣️
Legend
I’ve always been a fan of Christina. She has such a way with her songs and lyrics that speak to your soul and heart. You actually know what she says and means. Such an underrated singer. I hate that this is what our society and world has come to. Social media has many pros but also has major cons. I work with children from age 3 to 12 years old and I can easily tell what parents monitor their children on social media and what ones don’t. We need to teach children and teens that we are all beautiful inside and out. We need to teach them that we don’t need make up or anything else to show true beauty. Growing up I never liked make up and I still only wear it on special occasions. I believe people shouldn’t be your friends or like based only on looks. The children really are our future. Let them know they’re all beautiful.
Kylie Jenner dislike this video
I'm crying a lot now. I wish I had heard and known these words when I was growing up
00:51 Great stuff, keep it up!
Thank you so much by support to Shakira with her new single MoNoToNiA an Shakifan supporting to the beautiful Christina Aguilera ❤❤
Que clipe foda ❤️❤️❤️ uma lição importante pra hj!!!
This is such a good message. I’m so disappointed and sad for the present generation who doesn’t know true beauty standards lies within self and unique genetically features each pocess. I don’t know why people trying to change that! I look at humans and they are so beautifully unique and different. But now so sad … 😢
Pop videos should be more like this.
In the early 2000s we had magazines, now they have endless Instagram pictures..
I love u christina
This is a great song, and a nice remake. Though, I couldn't help but notice all the actors in the video were very traditionally beauitful being told they're beauitful. There was noone overweight, noone with very bad skin issues, no bad teeth, no one with noticable body issues, those kids playing on the tree would all have looked totally in place on the front of a John Lewis catalogue. So, I'm not sure what beauty standard they were telling us we can ignore. The children all met it.
I was 12 when It came out and it made me cry cause I really needed to hear that... and  made me cry today as well cause is such a powerful message 💪🏼💜
I loved it years ago when i was young...and i love it now like 33years old woman ❤
The message that’s needed❤
😭😭😭
God damn it this music video is Hitting me as hard at 30 as it did at 12
I loved this song in 2002 when I was 18 and love it now at 38. Did Christine use her voice from the 2002 track as it sounds exactly the same.
I liked this video the minute I saw the 2022 version in the title and immediately knew what I would see. Such a powerful message behind this video and I'm glad that such artists are using their voices in their careers as a message for this young generation. Really love it ❤
Pero ahí vamos Ánimo Christina 🙏👍
Christina te hacen faltan más hits en español que supere a la cancion: Pero me acuerdo de ti
Cute.. But what does this really do... Lol commentary on a fucked up issue does nothing to change said issue just says "yea we know it's fucked..so heres a pop song someone other than who really needs help is making millions off of."
Its been awhile since I've even watched a music video but this song meant so much to me when I was a teenager and this video was so well done.
Talk about milking it 🙄🙄🙄🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
What a message nowadays! ❤
I...Wow. This was just as poignant as the original, maybe moreso.
I was wondering what this video would look like and I'm delighted to see it's what it is. Very heartfelt and empowering in every way!
Did anyone else release that there was only one heavy person in the video, that they were only seen for a few moments, and that they were not included with the other children to come out and play. So... it seems that message hear is, that you're beautiful no matter what you look like... as long as you're skinny?
💛💛💛
Should have included a lot more 'uglier' people
take back control. stop the marketing to the masses. quit social media now!
Como eu fiquei emocionado! Beautiful foi tão necessária a 20 anos atrás, e hoje mais ainda! Que mensagem, que vídeo! Viva a Christina, viva aos 20 anos de Stripped!
I cried watching the kids in nature. Thats the cure! Take the kids out and really connect with the earth, listen, breath, play like mother earth is a living being...because she really is. I am shocked at how normalised lip fillers and botox has become, ironically it made me feel less natural. Choose your influencers wisely, and unfollow all the people who make you feel bad. And for people looking for help: use discernment. A title is not enough, the person has to see you, and meet you and if it feels off: it is. I spent a long time finding the right therapists because I always assumed it was me who was off. Find someone who knows what pain is like, and who healed themselves. And love your self again. Youare beautiful!
L I G H T ❤️
Que vídeo! Que final! Essa música é icônica demais!!! ❤️
I guess I needed this
amazing video, amazing message.
there could have been an entire new song to accompany this new video... (that is cool) ... the first one belongs to this song.
Don’t grow up too fast my loves. Love who you are each day. I’m proud of you❤
❤❤
Should say “words AND IMAGES can’t bring you down.” Love this new video! 👏🏻
Goosebumps omg! 😢❤ I could cry watching this absolutely brilliant!!!
I remember loving this song so much when I was a kid. It's crazy to think it's older than me.
The message was desperately needed the first time around... it's beyond essential now. ❤‍🩹
I AM BEAUTIFUL
🌍🌍🌍🌍
🎶🎶🎶🎶
I cried as soon as the video transitioned to the kids outside running and playing. Kids now-a-days have NO CLUE what they're missing out on. Social media and technology really is causing the demise of society in my eyes.
In 2002 I was a 19 year old who needed to hear this song about myself.  Now in 2022 I’m a mom of a tween, she so needs this song right now.  Thank you for releasing again for this generation ❤️
Gosh. I just remember #DPRIAN when hear this song. Hope he'll be better
This release is needed in this generation! Social media is much more used now than before and it just gives you so many false body type expectations that it messes with the children's minds. Thanks for this.
ENDLICH ist Beautiful in Deutschland verfügbar. Ich hätte trotzdem gerne auch das OG video!! Bitte😭
No one fat in the video, so I can't relate to any of the girls there, but it's a really powerful msg from the lyrics.
Love this so much! Take away the phones and devices and just let kids be kids. Childhood is worth saving.
loved this song as a teen but unfortnately it wasn't enough for me back then to feel worthy... I've come a long way since then and now I'm a confident adult and words really can't bring me down anymore.  my heart is breaking for today's kids who believe some stupid crap about "beauty standards" that they get from tiktok and other sources... makes me wanna shout out "Kids, teens and young people! Those are all lies! Listen to Christina! This song speaks the truth and you ARE beautiful in EVERY SINGLE WAY!"
❤️
I wish there were some chubby kids. everyone deserves to feel beautiful
Hino! 💚💛
This song is great when you’re experiencing a toxic supervisor too 😅
The video is great, however I'm kind of let down about the fact that you left off the lgbt from the original. I remember being a kid in Poland and seeing the video in tv for the first time and it was a huge thing, people were angry that gays are shown in the tv but for a little me it was a meaningful moment then.
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Oh baby, go ahead and get that lil snackie from the machine and just live your life ❤️
真的感谢这首歌，鼓舞了我的一生。
Parents should watch this video with  their younger children  together and have them perceive with them what this video is saying to them . Kids need to be kids! As the saying goes we are only young once but will be getting old for a very long, enjoy the freedoms and innocence of childhood but keep mindful of the trappings of society
🥲 A Legendary Track who’s message will never die.
I cried when I watched this. This song aged well and is still relevant.
AWESOOOMEEEEEE
It’s weird because my friend is in this music video😊😂🎉
A timeless song of beauty and self acceptance.
the tree climbing bit 😩❤️‍🩹 I can’t remember the last time I heard a kid nagging to go play outside, now it’s just iPads and Netflix🥲
So powerful oh my god 💔
Thank to this song's existing
Since "flawless" became so mainstream  flaws seem so unnatural...
This song is now more needed than ever
Cried just as much as I did when the first one came out
chills ✨💞
but is there a way i should sound like, sing like, for singing?
Big boomer energy
Check this out https://youtu.be/0zuvS04f8cw
Incredible how this song couldn’t be more relevant today then when it first came out 20 years ago! Christina is true artist ❤
Wowzers, I was 18 when this came out originally and it resonates as much today as it did then. Makes me think of how much time I’ve wasted thinking about things I can’t change. The moment at the end with the kids playing made me cry. That’s how we all should be, free from worry and just enjoying our time. Thanks for the re-release x
I feel like the older video was more powerful than this one.
Amazing
20 years ago it hit because there was ultimately one ideal body type which almost no-one fit into, thus many people felt like they were less than they should be. Now there is acceptance in many spheres as adults but during those influential years the kids are seeing filtered, primped and preened ideals which are impossible to achieve in real life and as with 20 years ago, failing to measure up. It's a terrible cycle. Thanks for making this one Christina.
20 years ahead and this new mv popped up in my home feed. Goosebump!!
It's a great song but I don't understand the need to re-release it. This video was actually worse than the original from 13 years ago. That video had more emotional impact and was more artistic in its vision, and dare I say it, more controversial. This was only remade to fit in with the times (more people of color), which in itself is a noble thing but it added nothing new to the song. It's still a fantastic song though.
너무좋다❤
Wonderful, that’s message is so important!
Like a punch the gut. So poignant
Elon musk doesn't like this music video
Hermosa canción pero poderoso mensaje al final 💪🏽😌 gracias Cristina!
what is "stripped" ? tried to google, no definitive answers
The youth needed this
What a perfect time to re release when all our kiddies will be bombarded with all the shit that’s shoved down our throats due to social media, worse thing for this generation truly is insta, Facebook, TikTok and the worlds idealised form of what we should supposedly look  like act like and being doing with our lives
Sensitive spoiled and entitled crap.
This is the reason why young people should get affirmation to their bodies and not having the option of mutilating themselves. Boys become men and girls become women and both are beautiful. May all (young) desperate people be blessed with jesus' affirming love!
it's so sad that it's my own generation of millennials pushing for these toxic narratives saying it is "healthy" and "the right choice". Though in all honesty, I think my moms generation was worse, the amount of physical abuse she has done to herself in the name of "normal" and "expected" is mind blowing - all of this because of tv and magazines back in the days.
Social media is a sickness. The worst pandemic to hit humanity. Every day I get more and more disgusted by how we can rate eachother by the click of a simple thumb emoji. How it makes us feel successful and validated or the other way around. Our own value and self respect doesn't mean a simple shit these days, and I don't see how it won't get worse. I feel sad for our future and how little we care about it and eachother. I feel bad for our kids and the environment they grow up in. There is no place to be yourself anymore. And the most sad and ironic part is that we created it ourselves. We made ourself unhappy. We made ourself not good enugh. When will enough be enough? When is good ever at it's best? Who decides??
mercedes, GLEE ❤
Schön, bin Ich leider, immer noch, ein Opfer!
Brillanty Exquisite !!!
Arte
20 years and I never stop listening this song.
This is so deep and meaningful!! i like the part where all the gals (put on makeup) preparing to go on a Live-stream (tiktok or whatever u call that)
Timely especially in a world full of Instagram filters and vanity.
Ağlamamak mümkün değil... Böyle kaliteli iş için teşekkürler ❤️
She could have appeared in the video tho
Crying ❤ love you
this video really said TOUCH SOME GRASS
This song is aging like a fine wine.
I didn't even like Aguilera, but I bought her CD when this song came out because it was so powerful!
This is my best friend's favorite song when we were in elementary. Now he's gone. It's sad that he'll never see this version.
Beautiful!
Growing up, I was insecure of my height. I convinced my parents to buy me expensive supplements which did not work obviously. I was also quietly mad at my parents for a while because of their “short genes”. As I get older, I have accepted that there are better things to worry about than height. I learned to love myself and be thankful for all the things and all the people that I have. To top it up, I met the love of my life because of my height 🥹 I did not expect that at all.
Magnificent
Thnk you for the remake.
2022: Mankind needs a loving 🫂 hug❣️
what a good song. TIMELESS! dude christina aguilera thank you!
perfect timing!
PARABÉNS AGUILERA MAIS UMA VEZ...OBRIGADO.
just be you and never change what nature gave you. Because nature never makes mistakes
so real :(
Thank you!!!! CHRISTINA!!!! BEAUTIFULLY DONE
Social media has made things worse for sure. So have the Kardashians, and not because they're naturally beautiful. I mean, they were. It sends a whole message that even if you're already beautiful, you could be more beautiful if you change parts of yourself and that's not a healthy example for young people at all.
Rude, I didn't get drunk to feel things lmfao.   Love yourself first, peeps. <3
Xtina is on!
I'm literally crying right now
I AM BEAUTIFUL  Yes YOU are... I Love You🖤  The Voice Of An  Angel!!!
How to address insecurities without dumb labels. Take note, Swift
Congratulations for re-release a new video for this masterpiece song! A message very very necessary for the new generation.
🙆🏻❤️
I need this
I'm praying for all.. God bless in Jesus name amen <3
Now if we could bring back where is the love by black eyed peas life would be complete
Social Media Kills'
That video was so deep, now that I hear it as a parent (20 years later!)of 2 teens and knowing that this is what our world has come to. Mental health is real people! Every new generation born is being brought into this type of life style. Make the change! Be the change! We all are beautiful in every single way. We don't need social media to validate and define us and future generations to come. Let children be children!
Just want someone to think I'm beautiful.
So my 33 year old self is still tearing up to this song, very much like my 13 year old self when it first came out. Thank you, Christina.
I love the new version. Yeah. We need to change.
This song is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! A song that every young person needs to hear nowadays! We need more wholesome songs like this rather than the trashy ones they play on the radios.
This song was released when I first became a teenager and even though I was too young to fully absorb the lyrics, I remember it making me feel better. I hope it can do the same for the younger generation 🤍
We all needed this reminder.
It isn't the size and appearance that we win or fail; It's all about perseverance with a greater amount of resiliency that makes a person achieve whatever that person wants in life. Let's be contented by what we look like because that's who we are, but let us not have a satisfaction until we achieve the dreams we want not only for the benefit of our lives but also the lives of other people around us.
Save the children. Stop child transgenderism.
So happy to see this beautiful song re-released for a younger generation and kudos for the children and teens on the vid who really played their parts well. I shed more than a tear watching this <3
God is real ! Thanks Cristina! U keep  healing lot of 💔 with this powerful song
Every single person in this video is beautiful because they are a unique and unrepeatable expression of God's love. Children should be children and not concerned about anything else. You are only young for a very short time. I cried when they all went outside and played together. That is what it's about - being kids!
Great song but I think the video would feel more impactful if Christina had not had so much plastic surgery herself.
Omg, the woman who is singing this message to ya'll has had a ton of stuff done to herself alter her appearance and conform to societies idea of what is beautiful. What a joke. Lol
Powerful imagery
The same thing through two decades is bulliness has insecured at least  someone's confidence. This song still relates the problem until these days.
Proud to be samsung s10 user here. Tap the heart if were the same🙂
Thank you Xtina!
I’m so glad I grew up when I did. We had so many popular songs like this to inspire, motivate and uplift. Personally, I think that’s missing in a lot of today’s music. Music 🎶 has such power! …Everbody Hurts: R.E.M …Heal the World: Michael Jackson …You Gotta Be: Des’ree …You Learn: Alanis Morissette …I Believe I Can Fly: R. Kelly …The Middle: Jimmy Eat World …Try Again: Aaliyah
Still a very powerful song to this day.
Let's kids be kids.
relevant then ever..
Is it just me or this mv is trying too hard to be “relevant”, there’s at least 10 mvs and songs along these lines I can think of right now, so cliche
The song is still relevant. I will not have any children but this vicious circle of self-hatred has to end. Kudos to X-tina for addressing this issue.
To all the guys out there who feel as if you’re never gonna be as good looking or built as your male counterparts, don’t forget how many of us struggle with self-image. It’s talked about less in men but just as prevalent (literally, body dysmorphia affects men almost as much as women). Be kind to yourselves, you’re good as you are.
20 years later and your government have got people from within its organisation trying to convince the population that giving children hormone blockers and not telling their parents instead of treating their mental health issues and helping them feel comfortable in their own skin is the morally good thing to do. The western world is pretty messed up these days.
Why is everyone in the video conventionally attractive? lmao
I love it
Next re-release the year 2222
Added to the Playlist that includes "Unpretty" by TLC
It's sad how many young people are not going to see one particular underaged victim group in this song.
Cell phones need to go.
like this
Maybe it's not the social media, but the fact that our culture holds up stuff like THIS as being "Body positivity" when there is not ONE person of below average attractiveness in the video.  Not one person who isn't able-bodied. Only one person who is noticeably overweight (Who I notice isn't in the vast majority of the shots) and the emphasis is put on the phones rather than the way body image is presented.  I applaud what you wanted to do with this, along with everybody else who is applauding, but you failed.  As a disabled person who has been overweight and below average attractiveness for my whole life, I didn't see myself in this. I saw that EVEN IN A BODY POSITIVITY VIDEO I would be unacceptable.  In social media I find people who accept me, or at least don't judge me before they hear what I have to say. There are toxic people online, but there is also connection, and you are demonizing the method of that connection instead of demonizing the toxic attitudes of people who ALSO use it with the rest of us.  Social media is not the problem. Look futher.  (I have a reasonably good self image, in spite of the culture that does this. Don't worry about me. Worry about others who are under the influence of this culture.)
https://youtu.be/a6U0NuNx6Rs
This was extremely painful to watch. This is utterly our TRUE REALITY. Social Media has single handedly destroyed this generation, the next, and the next, and the next.  I literally wrote my comment unknowingly prior of the statements made at the end of the video which coincides my thoughts exactly.
Hay christina tu viste que aver recantado el tema que daría mejor pero bueno igual esta bien buen mensaje
The irony that this song will be considered a success if it does well on social media. Ooo what toxic times we live, I preferred 2003
The most fucked up part of this video is that most of these are KIDS. So fucked up the world we bought them into. It shows them at the end swinging on swings, running around, climbing trees- being KIDS. Thank God.

Clipe maravilhoso! Precisamos de mensagens assim para salvarmos nossas crianças, adolescentes e jovens da prisão que é a pressão estética. E viva a diversidade!
This is what Matt Walsh has been fighting against forever. Thank you Christina Aguilera for crashing USA and the LGB and Trans agenda with no survivors
perfect timing to bring this out again, brilliant song in the past and now
I appreciate the message, so much, but it's hard knowing this comes from a woman who, of course i respect so much, but, would change her appearance completely through plastic surgery and injections to stay youthful.
Amazing, Christina! Well done!
Beautiful and moving video, I nearly cried. But it would have been more convincing had she not been the one construing the ideal of a woman with her nudity in various covers, as well as showing off her figure. I wish she would lead by example rather than compensating in a somewhat marketing manner like this.
this song always bring tears to my eyes!  great time to re-release it! thank you!
Fantástica reflexão
Aż mnie ciarki przeszły... Love from Poland 🇵🇱🇺🇦
What a great video and the song is still as good, if not even better today then it was when it first released.
i was 13 when the this song came out. i felt ugly then. i am 33 now, still feeling ugly.
You are beautiful Christina Aguilera, thank you..
I didn't know this was (re)released and on the day I felt the crummiest, too. I needed this.
I've  cried when Kids are screaming
Música perfeita versão perfeita antes e depois ano 2000 e ano 2022 nada mudou as coisas piorou com a relação sermos pessoas diferentes uns dos outros de cada pessoa ninguém se aceita ser diferente um do outro e querem que todo mundo seja igual mais deus deu um dom pra cada um, um corpo,   um cabelo, um rosto ,um jeito de ser e temos que agradecer a Deus por ter feito cada um diferente porque se todo mundo fosse igual seria não tinha graça né 😢😔😔😔
Funny how you, Christina, are a huge part of why young girls feel bad about themselves today. You are part of the problem. Sorry but the truth hurts and no music video will make up for the damage you have and will continue to cause. Hollywood is pure EVIL!
Wow❤
Engraçado que só tem gente bonita no clipe, se pegassem pessoas aleatorias ia combinar melhor com a mensagem.
It’s been a while since i heard this music
I started crying, there couldn't have been a better time to re-release this
Beautiful message!
I think this hits even harder today... social media will connect us, they said. social media will help a world connect and bridge our differences through communication, and look at where we are now :(
That video is so true.
Crime sucks

tamam sensin
❤
🌹
wow.
20 years later and this song is still relevant as ever.
Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is? You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side 'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
This generation with social media and photo shop we need this new version 🙏🏼
Don't be on both extremes' ends, it is not an excuse to lie down and not do anything, but at the same time don't force yourself to look at others. In short, be the best version of yourself that you are born with.
10/29/2022 I was born on Monday, June 24, 2002… This song came out 20 years ago… I didn't know this song back then due to the fact I was only a baby
Don't look at me Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?

Gj Christina
Amazing, thank you!
Beautiful message that will pass on forever through this song 🥺
I can't help but think about the fact that all kids and people in this video are really pretty....
I'm from Colombia and I used to sing this song when I was little. Thank you for doing this
The fact that the ad I got before this vid was for an excersice app is not cool
Crying my eyes out!!! ❤️👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
With everything going on in the world, this message couldn't have some soon enough.... also, I forgot how much of a banger this was !!
I did not see one person in this video who was not model thin nor model looking.Whats that about? Putting Young and Beautiful People in a video about them not feeling beautiful seems odd. In fact it's a little insulting to those of us who aren't quite as good looking. Oh, look, beautiful people feel ugly sometimes too....boo hoo.. But I appreciate the thought in the video Pardon my crankiness please ...
This song is for everyone. Love your self no matter who and what you are. God created all of us perfectly.
An inspirational song and MV...back then n now.
This song always makes me very emotional! Just knowing that there are soul many children in the world that are suffering at the hands of social media with the pressures to look/act/behave a certain way, to be viewed as "IG model" worthy or simply to feel seen. It breaks my heart. We need more messages like this spread to our kids, you don't have to aspire to be the prettiest or the thinnest or the most popular. If I could I'd hug and tell every single child out there "You are beautiful JUST AS YOU ARE, in your own right in your own way. Never let anyone tell you any different, your uniqueness is your gift. Your gift is your purpose." ❤
This song helpend me a lot when i was 11y old and got bullied for being fat, back then i tried to hurt myself, and this song was one of the things that stopped me. Listening to it now, that i am grow up and overcome those trials made me tear again, i was looking at my young self, and telling her again, you are beautiful, no matter what they say.
Thank you for this video. Very special messege for all of us today
Immediate tears. Timeless message needed now more than ever before. Thank you Christina 🙏🏼🤍
This is beautiful in every single way.
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
This is so sad...
Somehow, I feel that the old video was more powerful
Powerful message from the beginning to the end. Reach out to your family and friends. Take care of your kids. Guide the youth.
This was beautiful.
❤️❤️❤️
Militou toda!!! mas só com criança magra e sem deficiência. Parabéns!
Magnifique
Dont give for Child a phone
This song needs constant re-releases tbh. The message​ is much needed for many​ of us, plus for many years​ to come.
I love and respect Missis Aguilera, but this clip is hypocritical now as she has done surgeries, Botox and fillers....
Where are the little black children. Representation matters. You’re making a song about us being beautiful but there’s no black children think of the message that sends. Wonderful message and song just wish there was black boys and girls represented. ONE is not enough
😭
I did not expect to get so emotional watching this!
Thx this Christina!  We need at least 3 generation's time after one generation's damage.
Thank you, Christina!   I love this song.  It always makes me tear up a little.  Such a powerful song!   Cool new video too!
I like the remastered version best! I like how it’s geared towards adolescents and the pressure of feeling beautiful and mental health
Better than the original! So glad Christina decided to make this version... the only thing that came up to me is that she is also kind of a part of that culture. Lips, boobs, bleach.. girls are looking up to her just as much.
I didn’t expect tears but that was beautiful and much needed for these younger people
Great song, great concept... but video just falls a bit flat. It's a little too 'controlled' in every shot, idk. Could've been made a lot better imo, it's an amazing idea.
❤️❤️
Those of us that saw the original video and cried at its lyrics now presented to the danger our younger generation faces at the reach of their hand daily…
👏
Wauw! Thank you, Christina ❤️❤️❤️
Goosebumps…all the emotions…thank you!
I am in tears. This is perfection
Unfortunate that no fat kids were represented
♥️
So glad this song is part of my life... If I was 80 this song will be still relevant - hymn for life. <3 love u forever Xtina
Okay, okay. Yes. But also no. When I was a kid, I wish I had someone who works out and takes care of their body as a role model. It's a completely different thing from girls, who are essentially told, no matter what you do, you won't ever look good without external help, such as photoshop, filters, or literally taking apart your body in surgery.
Thank U So MUCH ! ❤️
I don't see any emotions in these actors, I don't want to empathize with them.
The message was way more powerful in the original video
Thank you for this song, Christina Aguilera.❤️
I love you, Christina ❤
I love this ❤️🙏🏾
I feel there's irony in how many people will watch this off their phones. Myself included.
I am lucky to have such a good support system. It's very sad that some people start worrying about their body image so much and so young.
00:14 already crying
Excellent job. This video really says the current situation
This song has been my motto… my anthem. My encouragement and motivation to not let beauty standards dictate true beauty from within.
I literally was so confused for like 25 seconds. I could hear the music playing in my head and all I thought was: How can she be holding a cell phone in this video? But this is awesome!!! I love the kids running outside to play, just being kids. Ahhhh nostalgia.
Great job Fiona 💐
This version is for the newbies, who are living — without really LIVING.  On September 11, 2001, the world known to the rest of us changed forever, for the worse… That toxicity continues. It’s UGLY to still see it done in the so-called beauty industry.  As part of the recent and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the world faced new challenges. Many people defied wearing protective masks, the virus was spreading, they caught it (it wasn’t a hoax!) and a lot of them died… For the younger crowd: Who cares how or if you are wearing makeup or how or if what you’re wearing ‘matches’ or is not as fashionable or who is trying to influence you into letting go of your or your parents’ hard-earned money by selling you their  ideas of what’s “in” and only for you to invest in a expensive makeover whether you can afford it or not. Looks are not everything. A camera filter cannot hide the real you. Show everyone who you are, as a person. Above all, be kind. Advertising, in all its forms, is like …bullying! Take a stand. Resist. Look into the world of politics, but don’t get absorbed by it. Thanks to Greece for introducing DEMOCRACY to the world. It’s precious and not all countries have the same freedoms that we enjoy in our societies! Elections are a blessing when the voters have a clue what a local politician really stands for. It’s not a popularity contest! The right choice affects your life. Support the one who has, personally, convinced you — through their actions, and not their words. Feed your brain through real books.  Free your mind through travel, preferably international. Stay safe. 😷 Happy Halloween, y’all!! 🎃 Be who you want to be.
Such a cash grab
Welp that’s officially in the ‘nailed it’ category she never knew how relevant this song would become
But Christina had so many Beauty Sergerys in Her Life , that Song don't displays Her Real Image !!!
I loves this song so much , it boost my inner self to be more confident ♥ I always sung this everytime I do karaoke.. It helps me to be more happy and proud of myself beauty.. ♥
Prefer the original, it was relatable. This is just good looking people, normal people, all pretending to be ugly. Bit of a joke really Christina. Poignant song, but the new video is a let down.
This still is timeless! One of the most powerful songs in the world. I love you Christina. Thank you❤
chills
I love what they did with the video.  Friends… please know social media images are often filtered… it’s easy to take those images as if it’s real because they look real to us for the purpose of keeping our attention there.  That’s how social media makes money… the amount of time of us starring at pictures/products trying to attain unrealistic standards where only photo filter and editing can achieve is how these social media platforms make money.  Don’t be fooled by it.
O clip já fala por si só, entendedores entenderão. Não importa o q digam de vc, de sua aparência vc é linda, vc é lindo creia nisso.
If this videoclip doesn’t win every single prize this year I will be really pissed
This is incredible
Perfect!!!! 👏
This song is needed in this day in age getting surgery is one thing but beauty is define in many different ways surgery or not
I am feel emotional 😭
It isn’t just children and teens. I’m almost 60 and I still compare myself to our "icons” and feel hopeless and ugly.  I remembered the song, but forgot how awful the mass media pressure to "fit in" could make me feel. I still cry every time.
Sadness...the world needs a reset
I wish she had kept the "don't look at me" line in, despite it not initially intended to be part of the song.  In the original, the recording started a few seconds early, and Christina was telling one of the producers to "not look at her", but it fit the song so well that it was kept in.  Otherwise, it fits society so well today, like it did in 2002!
I never imagined this song to be so perfect for such a time as this.
This video is better than the original and I’m crying 😭😭
Still just as important back when I was 10, now I’m 30 and this song will always hold a place in my heart❤️❤️
jesser pinkmenz
This is what the children needs
Beautiful song, just wish the video had bit more variety of people, rather than kids who everyone is already gonna think are cute lol
what a terrible song
a cada ano mais atual e necessária a reflexão que essa música traz!!!!
I feel so emotional from this song. I struggle with Extreme insecurities,infact many other teens out there do. I've always wanted to change myself and my whole existence because of my self hate. Im so glad that this song was made at the perfect time.
We needed this Christina! THE WORLD NEEDS TO REMEMBER THIS ❤️
Men! keep working out, not because of anyone,  but for your health 💪🏽
This is amazing
Yeah everyone quit social media and focus on the real world 😂😂😂… you hypocrites
finally  someone talking about something
Thank you.
GO XTINA!!!
Christina said, "Touch grass."
At first ti thought the algorithm was doing that thing where it just pushes old songs for no reason. This is sick
Is it bad that I only watched this to see Christina in a skimpy outfit showing off her jugs? 😂 man was I disappointed! Jk great video!
Es curioso como hay una nueva versión con este contenido visual. Considerando las cirugías estéticas que se hizo la intérprete.
Efek negatif tekhnologi,
It is starting too soon now, everytime is sooner, children should be children! Not be dressed like an adult, and the type of adult who is so worried about appearences, let them be CHILDREN! let the girls be little girls, young girls, teenagers, maybe many of them want to play yet! yes, play like the children they are, SOME people were trying so hard to make childrne believe they are already adults, they are NOT adults, they are NOT adults yet, they are still children, I feel I am sure there are many, many teenagers that would like to play instead of being forced to do adults things with malice and without any responsability, and feeling so pressured to fit in one r another group, being accepted by those follow the crowd, posing , pretending, being what they are not,  doing things they are not ready to do, dealing with things they should not be dealing with, I ask to myself how many people are hating other just because of their belifes of how someone should be, from their reality, how many people would love to play, run, laught, and climb a tree, this "mentality" of social pressure, is killing so many souls, and now the children are in danger, too young, too innocent, many people don`t realize the jail they are living in, because they believed in the lie of appearences, popularity, superficial things, HOW IRONIC, while the society tell us , grow up, be mature, be an adult... HEALING tell us, heal your inner child, Jesus tell us, only those who are like children will enter to the kingdom, and the kingdom is love, power and freedom, Not by force, but by love.
a good song is like an aged whiskey. this has only accentuated how beautifully you sing and write. very well
Ok sobbing thanks Christina 😢
People can get better, it's true, but better than their self, NOT COMPARING WITH OTHERS!!
Lucky is better😎
I literally have goosebumps. This has ALWAYS been a powerful song and re-releasing it in today's society is so very very important. I cannot love this enough
Such a beautiful song.! So she rerecorded this?
Where's xtina?
Cristina gracias por el llamado!!!
😭
Omg this song can be done over and over with social media imaging .
Now can you do one with comparison of what people vs what you don't have , and how couples fake for the camera.
Everyone who feels like they don't fit in should listen to this song. I don't think anyone should change who they are except for change to be healthier.
So powerful song ❤
Arrepiei incrivel!
AMAZING
왜 한국엔 이런 가사를 불러주는 가수가 없지?
J’ai eu des frissons … merci pour ce clip magnifique!
เธอสวยในแบบของเธอ
🥺🥺🥺
Emocionante e real! Parabéns pelo trabahlo Christina e Fiona! Thrilling and real! Congrats for work, Christina and Fiona!
Whatever makes you unique is what makes you beautiful. Be. Yourself. Cookie-cutter people aren't interesting. Authenticity is interesting. There's nothing more beautiful than being yourself.  ✌🧡🌈
An amazingly beautiful touching song. The depth of this song can reach the hearts of everyone everywhere. I love the creative way they modernized the video to fit the time we’re living in. Amazing job Christina and your team!!👏🏼👏🏼
why this singer sings beautiful   when shes unrecognizable with her filler and botox on her face? huh
Love this song. It's ironic the ads before and after were about changing the way you look.
It made me cry 😭
So glad you show what guys go through also being made to feel like we need to all go to the gym and have muscle
Timeless
This song just never fails to make to so emotional ever since
Would be good to see everyday kids rather than commercial model kids tho...
Complimenti Cristina gran bella canzone con questo brano hai superato te stessa e complimenti per la bellissima voce che con questo brano ci sta a pennello
❤
Aún recuerdo que en el cole  cantamos esa canción y la letra es hermosa. Es un mensaje precioso christina aguilera gracias por esa gran canción
Remeber hearing my mum play this song when I was a child forever one of my favourite songs x
every person is beautiful you just have to be able to see it
Will people every truly be happy with themselves?
This song does hit different now that everyone has smart phones and social media.
Is this re-recording sound???
I'd love her to make a spanish version of this song...
my question is .... do people really care about their looks? I havent really met anyone who care so much about their looks and the midea is making us feel like we should care about our looks...
original is 10000x better
Absolutely brilliant. The video made me cry, just like the first time, 20 years ago 🤍
literally crying for this
I'm an adult, I'm not supposed to cry watching this:'( I'm genuinely worried about kids/teenagers, even some adults affected negatively by what they consumes from social media. Hope that were all going the genuine peace we all are longing for
Still beautiful!
When I was a kid I couldn't really associate with the song, now I'm almost in the edge of crying because there are heavy mental wounds on me which I can't really heal without help. It wasn't the bullying that caused the wounds,  it was the ignorance of teachers who more likely punishes the victims than the bullies. Some teachers or other adults who were responsible for which part I will take ridiculed me, destroyed my ambitions. So I really don't have the best mental health. The reason why I'm still trying my best is my family. My mom is a lioness, she still get furious when thinking back to my school days. And my dad had really an verbal fight with a teacher who had teached him as well (it wasn't only about me, there came personal things into it as well.). Hearing this song now makes me cry. I wish I had the strength to say it to myself with that low self-esteem.
nie dajmy się wszechobecnemu nacisku na bycie pięknym ........... ŻYJMY
Nessa realidade, tão artificial em que vivemos, essa mensagem se torna impactante e necessária.
Thank you...🥲💖
Beautiful soul, who more than understands how it feels NOT to be beautiful....but stronger, better, much more worthy than just being skin deep pretty.  Love you, Christina!
I know that because you’ll see my comments on here more and more, you’ll think I’m nothing but an attention seeking brat which is false cause I’m really not and that’s the truth.  I had cyberbullies tell me stuff like I look like I’m growing a moustache cause I have a big nose and people thought I looked like a boy and thought I’m transgender when I’m actually a cisgender woman as in I was born as a girl and I fought back at them online, I reported them and blocked them. Even some of the lgbtq people online have been so rude to me just because my instagram comment on a post was taken out of context. In the case of the lgbtq community, I know they were just being defensive because they’ve been through so much hell that straight people will never understand but as for the other cyberbullies, they really thought they were joking around like yeah ok I get it life is tough but that doesn’t mean they have to joke around at the expense of hurting someone’s feelings.
Triste realidad
You should start by not air brushing and photo shopping every image/video you appear in and stop fucking with your face and body with surgery and shit. Practice what you God damn preach Christina. Hypocrisy at it's finest.
Yess we needed this Christiana Thank you. We all need to remember being alive and living happy I'd wayyyy more important the looking a way, talking, doing this being like this...I just hope they will figure that out before it's too late💗
Haters that bring us down are usually just jealous that they’re not as beautiful as you on the inside and out.
💙
Powerful.
The saddest thing is that back then it resonated with teenagers especially, but thanks to social media we need little kids to hear this now 😢
Beautiful and heartbreaking ❤😢
Time to sHiNe 🐝 s✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💎💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
I didn't realize how TV and social media can shape someone's mind so profoundlly when I was a kid. I remember having 8-9 years and be wishing with all my heart to be white and blue eyed. As a teen I would photoshop selfies to change my skin tone, eye color and turn my hair blond (thankfully I never posted any of those pictures). In my early twenties I didn't feel that need to be white, but ended up having a poor image of myself. I'd look my reflection and feel literal disgust... I felt ugly, my face would seem wrong in all places, my eyes, my nose, my teeth, my hair, my weight. Everything seemed wrong and unlovable. But at some point, after turning 25 I started to rethink the ideas I had of myself and decided to minimize my use of social media, ,so I never had Snapchat and until this day I don't have TikTok. I realized that I was beautiful in every single way, and I was beautiful my way. Nowadays, I feel like an attractive guy, not sure if others think the same, but I honestly don't care. I do use social media but trained myself not to care about all those hyper produced people. I feel confident with my exterior. I feel awesome, I feel handsome. I know I'm not perfect... who is though?
I know I am ugly but this song makes me feel slightly better lol
Still stand for the original video.
Tik tok has manipulated kids more than any influence in history. They are a mess now. This is all hipocrasy baby girl
I'm not crying, you're crying.
Kids should be playing outside with friends, having fun, living life! Not worrying about their sexuality, appearance, or social media. How times have changed, for the absolute worse 😢
This video reminds me of TLC's unpretty music video.
Hermosa! Gracias
Horses have near 360 degree vision. Cool yeah.
I love how she used kids and teenagers to really show how social media is changing them. Standards and expectations are higher. They’re also the ones being damaged and easily influenced. It’s really sad to see. Because the only worries a kid and teenager should have is schoolwork, not trends. It’s corrupting all of our minds and this is why we’re always comparing ourselves to everyone else.
Great video.
Love it ❤️❤️❤️
Lloré de pequeña y ahora vuelvo a emocionarme de adulta 🥺❣️
whenever you feel unpretty, remember this, physical beauty will fade, it has an expiration date. focus on the inner beauty and let it shine from within! nothing beats self-love, you are YOU no matter what other people say.❤
You can’t change the fact that there’s always a beauty standard and you will compare yourself to it inevitably. So the only thing we can do is to encourage ppl who want to change and also support ppl who don’t want to change themselves. I love the “you’re beautiful no matter what they say”, you can do all the surgeries or you can keep your default look, no matter what, you’re beautiful.
Christina has had tons of work done since she released this song and I just wish she could have listened to her own message, because she was a beautiful girl before and whatever shit the industry put in her head was unnecessary.
Enjoy the American dream 🤮
Kids actually being kids and playing 💕💕💕 as they should be
cried the first time I saw the original video for the song, and i’m crying now at this 🥲🥲 this is beautiful! thank you christina! ❤️❤️
WOW!
💖
Beautiful message. I love this song ❤
Thanks 🙏 for this.....i hope this at least gets viral for this new generations 💜 and the craziness that internet is creating.  F...k social media....
We’re perfectly imperfect always remember that! 🧡
No matter what they say, we’re always beautiful in our own ways and be proud of it!❤  #TranswomenAreWomen
Omg.. 20 years later and this song still makes me cry... thanks
😭
The kids need to live like they really want inside their childhood's jokes, having fun, creating, standing next to others kids as well.
Love this video
😒😒😒😒😂😂😂😂. You are a bitter woman, you are envious and treat people badly. You have a beautiful voice but you never shine, you always were and will be someone else's shadow.
Woow 👏👏 ppl being obsessed about their looks more than ever it is unimaginable...
And of course, every person in this video is conventionally beautiful.
Next time use ugly kids please.
This was beautiful and couldn't have come out at a better time. Thank you - I needed this.
not bad
El Vídeo está genial, 💗👏👀😱 representa la infancia inmersa en los aparatos tecnológicos, en la actualidad, Les falta hacer amigos, salir a Jugar 🤸
Jesus I remember when this came out and it’s message is still on point from over 30 years ago….every tween should soak in the essence of the song
😢❤ still so important
Cut for time - the chubby kid smashes into the vending machine and starts binging. The tempo picks up…sweet…sugar…candy man!
This is very cool to do. Every generation needs this song.
This got the chills out me watching it 😭 I'm so proud of Xtina for producing this. Such a strong message! Beautiful is still as much an anthem now as it was 20 years ago.
I knew Christina Aguilera was a conservative! I'm glad she's taking this moment to let all these kids know not to be bullied into surgeries because being trans is popular right now. Telling all these kids surgery is not the way is the most beautiful message
Still relevant until now coz more people still need to hear it 😔❤️
thank you Christina. we needed this.
When someone has to repeat something so many times... perhaps it is not very truthful
Empowering
Timeless...thank you
The song is great, but the updated version of the video lacks the heart of the original. You just can't replicate the message of the song with new paint of coat. In my opinion, this video just looses the soul of the essence that Christina told years ago. It just didn't work for me.
This song is everything... and this video is amazing and the message too!
This song hits reality differently because it is happening every day, it’s real. I wish we continue to feed young viewers this kind of content. Not affiliated links that leads them to overconsumption and unnecessary things just to feel that they fit in the society 😔
Classic then, classic now, classic forevermore.
I work in mental health with women who have eating disorders. This is very accurate. Especially kids doing makeup and trying to meet up “expectations “ that have been presented by media. Keep your children away from internet
Orgulloso de ti Christina ☺️
Love this song! It makes me think of the beauty of each person no matter how we are, what we look like, and what we are dealing with. It makes me think of God’s love.
I always thought the song has a great message about loving oneself as we are and to not give in to the outside noise and critiques. However I’m sad that the very own Christina Aguilera couldn’t be the role model she tried to portray in this song lyrics.   She gave over to her insecurities or societal pressures and changed her body with cosmetic surgeries to resemble that ‘Kardashian-esque cosmetically altered’ physique instead of accepting how beautiful she was when this song was first released.   It’s disappointing as a fan that she’s rereleased this song and redid the video when she still hasn’t accepted herself enough to have the implants removed and undo the cosmetic alterations she’s made to her breasts, hips, butt etc. in order to not come off as total hypocrite. I challenge her to undo all that and be the example she’s trying to preach to the youth about. 🤨
Meu Deus, o quanto eu chorei...♥️
This is EVERYTHING. IM IN TEARS. THANK YOU XTINA FOR THIS MUCH NEEDED MESSAGE.
Beautiful and such a needed message for our young people.
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
Scary , the life young children have now
Danggggg
The original video was way better.  This was unnecessary.
So this is Christina Aguilera telling us about how social media is influencing our body-image, with references to plastic surgery, saying it's okay to be beautiful as you are, when she has half of her face filled with botox. OK.
Старый клип намного лучше
This song was already extremely significant in my school days! To this day I suffer from what was done to me in my childhood and teenage years because of my weight. Social media is making the issue more prevalent and earlier to children. With filters and the promotion of cosmetic surgery, a standard is created that is/should not be attainable. Thank you for the video and this very important message!
Wish I could hit the like button 50000 times. Love you Christina!
This was so needed honestly. I mean it’s not a perfect video but still
- Stripped: Beautiful 2022 * this needs to change * - Also Stripped: DIRTY * Christina, you nasty (yeah) *
Doesn’t seem relevant
Thank you. 👏🏾
Most people today rely on the innovations in cosmetology and science thinking that the progress in this area should make all people beautiful and happier, when in fact the humanity will only evolve when it overcomes the beauty stereotypes.  Thanks Christina for this masterpiece and a kind reminder
I will forever love this song the music video back then was amazing and really showed some hard hitting things but this video is the better one by far it is true that social media is affecting our mental health its like u can't have an opinion or u get comments saying vile things when all your doing is living your life
Why is every single person in the video beautiful.... lmao
The main message: if you have children you need to control their exposure to social media. Conversation is key. People are not and should not stop doing what they like or achieving the look they want if it makes them happy just because children and teens have so much access to social media with no guidance at all. Parenting is hard even harder now than ever before. So think about this things before becoming a parent.
This song was relevent before then, back then & now ✌️
This is our generation...
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
can this song not make me cry for like.. 10 seconds. Thanks
This is not just a song this is a powerful statement that unites all people. Mental health issues are a real thing. No child or person should suffer because of What social media says we should look like .
"Life for a man is harder than life for a woman" 😂😂😂😂 what clown said that djdjdjsjjsjdjdkdkjd
TikTok is a plague on the earth
F*ck. I cried.
If only the ideal for women was to be buff and strong, then at least we'd be allowed to eat lol. I'd trade the female size zero ideal for the male gym bro ideal ANY DAY
Just couldn’t stop crying
how beautiful
Perfect.
Holy shit I am crying. Thinking about all of my middle school students.
I remember watching the original when it was released. Still as impactful today.
👀
Beautiful song, Beautiful message, Beautiful music video. All truly Beautiful.
Song still slaps Would've liked to see more different skin tones  Unbelievable how in 2022 it's still pretty whitewashed. Do NOt come for me
This song saved me so many times when I was a teenager. I am now a mum and it hits hard to think of my daughter dealing with the world as it is today. I hope Beautiful can help people today, as it did for so many of us 20 years ago
I wish she had changed up the song a little not just the video!
I must confess, I was expecting a music video filled with tired, woke, sexualised, virtue signalling tropes but here we are with a simple reminder (especially to our kids) that they are beautiful in their own skin. There is no need to modify and permanently alter their bodies, in order to feel like their "most authentic selves."   Regardless of whether this was the true intent of the producers, I can applaud and receive this message. I am relieved to see that this is even more wholesome than its predecessor 20 years ago.  Kudos
we are beautiful ❤️
I think this song is the most relevant in today's world.
I was just talking about this song to my co worker who's 23 says she even tears up listening to it.  Its a song of all ages
were all just kids trying to follow what is known as “right”. When you reach adulthood, you realize, they’re all just playing a made-up game.. Follow YOU.
All of the sudden I am back to 2000 ❤
Look like mini program girls
🥰🥰🥰
Ever day
I don't know how many times I've seen this and I still cry every time, much love ❤️
I’m so happy to listen to this song again in 2022 I could change my mind about appearance and become to love myself whatever I look like thanks to the song Thank you so much, Christina👍👍
❤️🙏
When this originally came out I remember when I first saw the video and it really hit me hard because of the LGBT presence which was rarely shown then. I cried then and now seeing this and all these poor kids holding phones expected to be physically perfect made me cry for them! At the end when they played in trees is where I wish they could be and have a chance to be a kid!
one of those songs that kept me alive in my younger years
This song was really important to me as a teenager . It’s sad that today it’s still a big thing and that nothing has changed. Maybe it even got worse 😢.
J'ai les frissons, ho i brividi....
Love you❤
🥰🥰
This was so needed...here since 20 years almost and I was glad to be there then as i am now. Thanks Cristina
Osea ver este arte y lo bajo que ha caído Madonna es cuestionable, Aguante Christina Aguilera ❤️
body dysmorphia is at a all time high. thank you for reminding us of this song.
I got the chills
I remember what this song meant to me as a teenage girl and now it feels like it’s more important then ever.
Been holding back a lot of anger after someone expressed disgust and insulted me for my skin color. As if having extra melanin makes me dirty, ugly, and repulsive. Now after hearing this song, I finally broke down.
All human beings are beautiful in their own way… ❤❤❤❤
Miss The Early 2000 ❤
Love this sooooooo much... *Not crying .... Okay alil
(Just in case, what i say below is not about music. That music is strong and timeless. The problem is the new clip, it just doesn't hit as hard as it's supposed to) . . Ok, look, the 2002 clip, yeah, got it hard, it talked with teenagers, showed insecurities. Now this one is just so cringe, like a 40's person trying to make movies for a 12 years old, just not as emotional as you thought. It's good to get that music back on these days, yes, we can see the timeless message. A great ideia, horrible execution. I only see older people from 20 years ago liking this, why? Because it brings memories. But the new generation? The one that appears in the clip? no, cringe.
From 4 to 24, a soundtrack to my life
Wow thank you! That was beautiful
As the mother of a young girl this video breaks my heart.
The woke version 😂 you've become irrelevant haven't you xtina?
Guter song leider traurig das der song immer noch aktuell ist. Ist  so schade das wir diese Stimme und diesen Menschen (Sie ist wahrlich toll) brauchen
@2:12 that's Andrew Tate right there...
Every young child and teenager needs to see this
this brang me into tears, thank you
No 1 song for the next 100 years... Hit 🎯
This has strong Black Mirror vibes
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
old one is better
Sitting here at work, watching this 20 years later. When I was the age of the students that I currently work with. It hits differently, because I’m older, much wiser than the 12 year old girl  that I used to be, which is not surprising. But also realizing that things have gotten worst, and woke culture isn’t saving from that fact either. I cry because not much has gotten better. So here we are. Beautiful recap Christina. Thank you
My mom said to me that she loved this song as a kid, it’s a really strong song..
20 anos depois    e com questões   tao atuais
I love everything about this, thank you Christina for making a song that meant so much to other generations, and then renewing it into something that newer generations to come will be able to relate to, and also can come to appreciate this visual representation.. Glad some Celebrities and Artist are actually trying to make our youth feel better about themselves because it's pretty obvious they're having a really difficult time. This inspires me and I hope it inspires others to feel more comfortable in their own skin and being proud of the body you were born in.
Why is it the girls getting surgery are still conventionally beautiful though?
I'm beautiful inside out . I'll try my best no matter what♡
lindissa ideia de reviver esta musica e ficou lindo o clipe
Lovefrom Russia 🇷🇺 Absolutely love Xtina, thank you for this new version! I hope it will help to raise one more generation of “fighters” ❤   Didn’t intend to write it, but I can’t help it. It’s so sad that this song is meant to promote kindness to yourself and to others, but people from my country cannot watch it without turning VPN on.   I know why it is like that. Still makes me sad. I believe that everyone should have access to the kind of music that contributes to making people nicer.   You are all beautiful both on the inside and outside! ❤ Let us not be driven by political games. I hope this hate towards Russian will be over.
Christina Aguilera is The Real Queen!👑❤️🔥🔥🔥✅
Diva
Queen
One word amazing social media is the devil
I’m so afraid for our kids me being 17 years old back then with no social influences.
beautiful lyrics & also the mv too!! 🥹❤️
Beautiful song, beautiful message ❤️ then and now.
♥️
TBH, I think this video is a bit tone-deaf and scaremonger-y - who realistically thinks the solution to people's problems with social media and being online is only getting resolved by throwing your phone and "going outside to climb a tree"... The old video actually illustrated the reality for people, how they felt, and was coming from their (and I am saying mine as well back when I was the teen listening to the music) pov, not just showing a bunch of conventionally pretty children to pull on the heartstrings of parents and caregivers
These days the natural look is considered ugly or awkward. If you don't have filled in eyebrows, long lashes, dyed hair, face full of make-up and don't have any curves, you are seen as less attractive.
Most of these people are conventionally attractive
ni un latino en el video ajajaj please
Still beautiful even 20 years later we needed this message especially in this day and age
After another night of getting my ass beat this is helping me feel better..
Looks like an h&m advert almost
This song is so important to me  suffering from a hair pulling disorder for nearly my entire life  and the names i get called  <3
Chills and made me cry. The fact some of these are so young...
And all the kids look perfect!!! 🤔
Absolutely love this song, however I'm disappointed that it's not an updated version of the song 😕
It’s so sad what the world has turned into. I am so glad I grew up in the 2000s and early 2010s… I can’t imagine what it is like being a kid or teen growing up in 2022. Social media destroyed the world. I miss the days before social media when everything was more genuine and real.
FULLY GOLD 💛💛💛💛💛
This song still makes me cry. It’s crazy now cause I felt the impact of media and stuff when I was a teenager. That was when media and social media really became a thing. But now I’m at work and there are 7-8 year olds talking about their body hair saying they need to get it off. I’m like why are you guys caring about that, it’s crazy to me. Then a 13 year old girl came in and she had a full face of makeup and lashes and nails and all this stuff and my heart kind of broke because it’s like why are you thinking of those things now . Why is it so important to them at such a young age? It’s heart breaking that kids can’t just be kids
Great song and a great video! Body image is one primary area in which teen social comparison leads to negative emotions—not only for teen girls, but for all genders. Many feel inferior because of social media, which leads to lower self-esteem, negative body image and a higher risk of eating disorders.
This is one of the beast and least-cringiest videos on the harms of social media on young people I have seen. Excellent creative work to whoever made this. It is truly fantastic - evokes all the feelings
This is brilliant
More important than ever! Thank you so much!!
crying because its so true and needed ❤️
AHHHHHHHHHHHHH GAWWWWD ✋😔🤚🙇✋😔🤚🙇
I don't personally perceive anything wrong with the "kid and guy lifting weights" and the "before & after of the guy who lost weight and toned" - these two things are not "shortcuts" or "cosmetic" like the other stuff in the video, it should actually be portrayed as "positive" and "motivating" instead.
nowa wersja klipu, niestety dokładnie oddaje to jak wygląda dzisiejsze patrzenie na samego siebie przed pryzmat wyidealizowanych osób z telewizji i mediów społecznościowych ....
Xtina saving a generation once again <3
A great new video for an amazing song. Still very valid
Right on time ❤
As a 90's kid I miss those good days where everyone just enjoy thier time outside and there weren't much social media involved; no external judgements (well maybe some but not like today) and everyone basically wear whatever or just dressed semi similar in thier accordance proximity. It's crazy to be a mellenial and witnessing all these expediting mental issues.
Yeah but it’s funny how Christina has had so much work done herself , Botox filler ect…. Photo shopped and airbrushed pics online , promoting to be and look “perfect “ when no one is . Let’s get real . Great song and message but let’s stop already …. The youth is damaged enough .
Truly magnificent! Thank you 🙏  It’s about time someone pushed back on toxic social media influences.
Cried when I was 10 still crying at 30 🥹🥹🥹🥹🥹
Oh so she didn’t re-record the vocals? Just a new video.  Well the visual for the original video was so advanced and way ahead of its time! Those issues are way less taboo now. Prayers to anyone in situations where they don’t feel beautiful ❤
*In my opinion, this hits more now.. we rely so much on the internet for anything and everything.. cyber bullying is a thing that actually happens irl, comments, likes, subscribe, TikTok, YouTube accounts, Instagram, Facebook you name it even the most unknown sites/sources gets a view or two because we are that reliable to our social media.. tbh, the 1st thing I do after waking up is to grab my phone and check updates*  It's scary some times 😬
Here comes the waterworks
私が十代の頃、この曲に救われました。 今、苦しんでいる人達に、この曲が届きますように。 再リリースしてくれて、ありがとう。
The message of the song is great, and the video is powerful... I would say though... literally EVERYONE in this video is physically beautiful so it's a bit...hmmm.  It's like when someone like Kim Karbashion says "looks don't matter".  Just comes across a bit condescending.
What a great message and this new video is incredible. Though I find odd that Christina has had multiple surgeries herself.. she doesn’t practice what she preaches 😢
WOW 🥲
Thank you ♥
The remix! She said. Here's a little love for the mew generation 💕
I’m so glad you did a 2022 video for this!! It’s so need especially during these times. We are beautiful ❤
the ending where the children are playing looks like an H&M commercial though
beautiful. thank you for this.
So many tears, and thank you for everyone.
Love this! I was 12 y/o when this song first released and time has changed so much. The girls yelling at 2:45, I don't know why but my eyes filled with tears. Such a strong song! ♥
What a sick society we're living in
Everyone supposed to hear this
Everyone supposed to hear this
Yeah girl, you're so damn right
Wow this is amazing, i didn’t know I needed to watch this
Oh, a new video :o I really loved this song in my teens! ... and is this latex??
As a huge fan of the song, I have to say the original version is much better! The message in the new one is great, but the visual and production are weak, compare to the original which has some very strong graphics, touched me so hard (and many other people too)
This makes me wanna laugh because it looks so silly. It is silly, but it’s the harsh reality.
i felt this.
Tempos depois e essa obra atemporal me despertasse os mesmos sentimentos.  🥰
Just sent this to my niece whose going through it this song helped me out a lot growing up what a perfect time to re-release this song beautiful Christina ❤❤❤
I was a teenager when this song came out. This is what I heard back then. Thank you for making this video <3
❤️❤️❤️
It is the most horrific horror movie that we watch every single day. Watching the impact that social media has on little children the last years and what they are turning too. But unfortunately it doesn’t affect only little children, it affects everyone that use it, both ways.
This song hits so different especially nowadays…
Con esta canción tengo 10 años de nuevo y tengo un excelente gusto musical... El mensaje que nos deja siempre es necesario
Love how they only used conventionally attractive children for this 😂
Her voice still beautiful 😍
Very powerful video. The last shot is very haunting.
Damn who cut the onions?! 😭
Still so powerful ❤️
could have been a much better video for the occasion
Thank you. Let's do the best change.
I am crying. I’m sorry. It'll be better. You're beautiful, so don't torment yourself. It’s your life, so don’t compare yourself to others. We are Beautiful.
Im a christina aguilera fans since 2002 it would never be change im a fighter love christina
Everyone needs this song
Las bailarinas tan esquemáticamente dance mom..
I always wished to see this song in a video clip. such a beautiful song. Happy to see this after all these years. Thank you, Christina!
this song can never get old. because we can relate to this no matter which generation we come from...
Did you know that Linda Perri (the girl who sang "What's Up" by 4NonBlondes) was the one who wrote this song?
Eeek it’s definitely way worse now from when this song first came out I think ….. I feel bad for the youth but I guess they have to learn how I did and get off social media and main stream media , news , radio ect…. Not a healthy world
:))))
I’m soooooo glad I seen this video
Kids playing outside era is officially done , sadly.
있는 그대로가 아름답지 못할 지라도 있는 그대로의 아름다움을 볼 줄 안다면 그걸로 충분히 값진것
Fuck tik tok
This song is the legend ever!!
I love you Christina🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
The world needed this right now. Thank you Christina
Дуже класне відео про те, як соц мережі вкрали дитинство
She should sing this song to herself, she gets cosmetic procedures on her face often, even though she's already beautiful. — By the way, I think she's prettier naturally.
Thank you so much Christina Aguilera - I needed to see this & hear this so badly.  We all do.   ❤️‍🩹
The original makes more sense. This new one looks like a Dove Commercial ✌🏻
Love it! Very much neeeded nowadays. This song will never get old. ❤❤
This song never quite hit me with the message when I was a teenager but it’s hit me now. And it’s needed now more than ever.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Still my favourite song of all time, so versatile. The original clip though, wow, always hits me, so groundbreaking at the time & with all the BS you were dealing with at that time....this is me, deal with it & yeah, I can sing the shit outta anything! Respect 👊🙏♥️
I loved this song then and I still love this song now!  I'm so glad there's a new music video, a new interpretation of the beautiful message in the song.
I love this song when I was high school student ❤
Amazing video 🥲 I wish people realised how damaging social media can be for young people in a world where everyone is constantly comparing themselves
But like every person in this video is a traditionally attractive human...all thin, good teeth, nice hair, clear skin, etc.
Thank you for everything you stand for, Christina! 20 years later, I'm still battling, but I'm here.
it's still powerful
It’s not easy we’re still gonna pick pretty over ugly, like butterflies over moths.
Much love from Spain. I was nine when the first version came out. Loved it since then! Such a beautiful voice and powerful message. ❤
Would have been on point if she actually broadcasted every color shade and ethnic background in the music video
OMG, this is now 20 years old?  Still this song is my favorite.❤
I wasn't prepared for all the new feelings this song gives me now that I'm listening as a mom vs. 20 years ago. It's not about me anymore, and that makes it so much more special.
Okay thanks for representing every races except Indians.👏
majority of people who are dealing with this issue are overweight, i think this song is powerful and i do agree with it . i do think they needed to maybe show more larger poeple in the video though. not that you gotta promote obesity by saying its okay to be fat. but more to be realistic with whats happening in the world.  i think fat people had one representative in that video.
Christina Aguilera, a mother of 2 children, son, age 14, and a daughter, age 10, is probably starting to see them struggle with growing up.   Those are both ages when you begin noticing perceived “imperfections” and can start comparing yourself to others in a negative way.  I think it’s ‘Beautiful’ of her to re-release this song for this generation.  I remember being a pre-teen and listening to this song when it originally came out. I was constantly bullied about my appearance and this self-love ballad gave me hope and comfort.  Love this lady !!!
That was perfect
Best LGBT song of all time ❤🏳️‍🌈
So happy my kid can hear this message. This is the definition of a classic song!
Icons then , iconic now.
time to cry
Omg I cried this song is so needed today 😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
Chills…absolutely beautiful video to go with an absolutely beautiful song!
I’m crying! This speaks a lot about our reality 😢
Christina Aguilera una luz en el escenario musical actual ❤️!
So important to see. Thank you, Christina!

Iriarte te quiero ride como a mi bike
As pessimistic as it may be..... It will only get worse for body image.... As long as social media will be a thing in this world... THE. RIDICULE  OF PEOPLE WILL NEVER STOP...........
This song is more relevant today than ever
The world needed this again to save the countless lost souls chased by the pandemic of social media facade
You're not ugly sweety, society is.
Word can't bring you down
Hermoso
Moral of the story...touch grass 😅
Why has it been over a week until i found about this? Everyone should be talking about this. We really try to act like we've become better over the years but we haven't. And yes, we try to teach those close to us to love themselves and be tolerant but that's so hard nowadays because the rest of the world isn't being taught that
❤❤❤❤❤ This song was my life saver. Beautiful.
~~~~~~
Everybody is watching on their phones, right? How ironic!
Love the message❤️
Timely Christina. Thank you. XO
EPIC SONG!👑🔥🔥🔥❤️✅
❤
This song is one of those songs that I will remember every word for the rest of my life, they mean so much to me that I can't figure out how to describe it, thank you Christina for making a masterpiece
John Lewis advert sort of emotional
this song means a lot for me, it gives us a deep touch for believe in our selves
parabens, mamae, voce lancou o clipe da decada
Great reimagining of the video. But why no Christina? Would have been so much more powerful and polemic.
ありがとう
The best, the Queen, LEGEND
Love this video and the timeless message. Stay true to yourself and be kind to others.  ❤❤ ❤❤ ❤❤ ❤❤ ❤❤ ❤❤
I almost forgot this song. Thanks for reminding up yeah we're all beautiful
The best message on 2000 s for the youthness, saying us beatiful from the tv , like a caress  (and with her amazing voice )♥ Cristina was a visionary for today .
Crying again like the first time I've heard this song.
So dont understand this video christina has had breast implants and alot of face and body surgery she sings to love yourself as you are but she does the opposite just dont get it
This song was ahead of its time. Timeless.
Girl makin us love ourselves for 20 + years. Thank you xtina 🖤
boring, this "message" has been repeated over and over already
😢😢😢😢😢😢 the most / wroste sad version or the world is became
The kids climbing the tree bought so many memories of my childhood. 90s baby
true beauty
I'm not crying, you are.
SO IRONIC AND RIDICULOUS FOR A CHICK WHO LITERALLY DESTROYED HER WHOLE FACE WITH PLASTIC SURGERY. 😂😭
this song was needed then...needed now. ❤️
Thank you for making this again😭it boost my confidence now because I watch it.......I have many insecurities and this video made me cry.....
❤
So much more depressing than the original but perfect for how things are nowadays. The flipside was it's also beautiful. Cried so much.
I agree w the message but wow the sensationalism is intense
I’m only 17 and already I’m scared for how kids are coming up now. It’s not their fault in the slightest but they are in so, so much danger.
Im watchingbthis with my kids tomorrow.  The video was great long ago, and Even better this time around.
Forte hein.... amei a mensagem através da música.
Eu tô vivo pra ver isso de novo 💙
Now that I have 2 little girls in this world this song hits home even more.
Achei que está imune a essa música, mas Beautiful sempre se supera. Ciscos e mais ciscos 😭♥️
what an art work.
This is so freaking important - like these were just KIDS!
MEU DEUS NESSA VERSÃO EU SOU A GAROTA QUE QUER TER O CORPO PERFEITO QUE TEM O QUARTO CHEIO DE FOTOS DE CORPOS PERFEITOS,ALGUEM ME AJUDA
I think the only way to get this under control is if instagram just ceased to exist honestly
ugh, more typical rhetoric spouted by older folk who don't understand modern culture. RIP Chrstina Aguilera's career.
Xtina says touch grass
I'm 28 now and was lucky that social media wasn't no were near as big and filled with crap as it is today when i was a teenager. When all this "beauty" shit started and influencers became a thing, i was over 20 years old and mature enough to see right through all of this and not get manipulated by this poison. However, a 15 year old boy or girl living today may not be able to see through this and it sadness me to know that millions of teenagers today think that there's nothing more to life than to fake a picture perfect life on Instagram or to do some weird dances and challenges on TikTok.
I HAVE NO WORDS FOR IT. PIECE OF ART AND SO REALISTIC
i am beautiful no matter what you say
Theory of the song: You are beautiful, so you shouldn't try to change yourself and try to conform to the societal pressure of changing your looks to become more beautiful in other people's eyes (and should find the beauty within yourself). Music video: Only shows naturally beautiful people by society's measure or e.g. the actual 'Golden Ratio' of beauty and people who wouldn't need to physically alter themselves to be so. (And no I'm not saying beautiful people "don't have the right" to have insecurities, but imagine a young "ugly" boy/girl/other seeing this and thinking to themselves "Oh but I don't look like that. So I should change myself".   P.S. I also feel this music video mocked mental illness, and taking medication for it or i.e. getting the help they need,  instead of showing what difficulties people face with such illnesses.   P.P.S. This music video should have never been re-done. This music video went back in time, where the original was advancing what its days beauty norms were.
This song was for sure relevant back in 2002 when it came out... It saddens me to say that it is even more relevant today than back then. It should've been the other way around... it should've lost its relevance instead.
Mil aplausos para Christina Aguilera que ha hecho de un himno un nuevo comienzo para las nuevas generaciones que se envuelven en apariencias y algunos llegan hasta el suicidio .
Woooww beautiful video
Está canción me hace llorar, bastaa!! 😭😍💕
Simply i love Xtina🙏💖😘🍀
Amooo essa música ❤️❤️❤️
I wish Christina really took the words to heart. She really destroyed her body and Face with surgery.
AMOOOOO!!! GRACIAS 🙂 🥰
a true critique of today's society.
Música atemporal, não importa o tempo que for ela sempre vai ser presente e significativa
wow, thank you so much. this is so important.
Social media makes us so unhappy.
I work with teens with severe body image issues and am so glad I can show them this empowering song.
Que video mas flop, la version de Jonas Akerlund es mil veces mejor q esta cosa progre
Great video. This topic needs more atention.
dear christina, i know you probably wont see this message. i wasnt even alive in 2002. i just want to let you know how much this means to me. listening to this re-release after this song has been all through my childhood really resonated with me. last year, i struggled with anorexia, a self-harm addiction, intense clinical depression, crippling anxiety, and learning disablities. after these problems were revealed to my family and therapist, i came out to my mother as queer. i started my recovery journey. it was not easy to gain self love. i began oversexualizing myself and isolating myself from people in my life as an attempt to become more confident. it didnt help. now, after rediscovering myself, i am just as confused as ever but i am still confident and a boss. i deserve the world and so do all the struggling youth in this generation. social media is confusing and toxic, instead we should be using it to uplift each other.   thank u christina, xoxo louise
Good job for not putting in trans kids! THEY ARE PERFECT THE WAY THEY ARE! 😍
This song was the first time a pop star put two gay men kissing...as a gay kid this song changed my life forever.. THIS IS A REMINDER to never let this song die..the new generation needs to listen this is important
Que vídeo necessário
Linda demais. Sempre
Little girls with access to social media... that's really sad.
Best thing I ever did was to delete Facebook, Instagram & TikTok.
😍😭😍😭😍😭😍
This is inspiring 🙌
timeless.
Wow! She came back before november 😅
☹️❤❤
YES MAM this song needed to be re- released in 2022!!! ☝🏼❤️💞💖
I'm a teacher...I will show this video to my teenager students
Why does this song pop up whenever I type in Taylor swifts anti hero?
Sorry, I love Christina but this is a fake message. She posts this video against plastic surgery when she is full of them.
Shit music
Please go outside y’all and leave your phone  live your life! I’ve been off social media for 6 months and I love it! ❤I can love people better- I’m closer with genuine friends and I’m not as depressed as I used to be!
Perfeito video amei !!
So this gets praise and Taylor Swift gets called fat phobic? What a fricken backwards world we live in!!!
❤
😍😍🤩🤩
My kids don’t even get to play in creeks like we use to when I was a kid😔
It’s a shame you weren’t wearing your strap on in this video.
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
this video is so impactful, Thank you Xtina for reminding us that regardless of the beauty standards society tries to force on us- we are enough. WE ARE ENOUGH WE ARE BEAUTIFUL WE ARE WORTHY
What are we all doing to eachother….this hits hard and it is sad. We need to be kind to eachother No matter what or else the next generation will be hurt and it will keep going on….this is just a waste of humanity to be this mean to eachoter
Reina!!! no pudo haber un video mejor para explicar por lo que estamos pasando! me encanto. el mundo necesita un cambio
This song is so important to me and reminds me to accept myself and others in spite of race, ethnicity, color, physical appearance, "politics", sex and any single outside label or definition - as a human being. Thanks Christina <3
As someone with anorexia, THANKS
Not me crying🥲
Christina is beautiful
I could not agreed more with this infinite important message to our children and everyone really... may this help to put an stop to the madness and pressure felt by many ... mostly the children and adolescents, we are more!  much, much, much more and sooooo beautiful the way we just are, we are love! Dont allow anyone to distort the truth of the love you are ✨️💖✨️🙏
❤❤❤❤I love this so much!
This is so beautiful❤
GUYS you can watch the original/unedited version of the ‘Anti-Hero’ music video right here:  https://youtu.be/0o9iG_FNwYE  Let’s make it go viral please❤️
My Story 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Wow!
TENIA 12 AÑOS CUANDO SALIO AL MUNDO ESTA CANCIÓN HOY A MIS 32 AÑOS AUN ME CONMUEVE EL MENSAJE... CADA GENERACIÓN TIENE SU TALÓN DE ALQUILES..
Lyrics Don't look at me Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is? You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side 'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
What's the boy/razor thing about? ♥️
This song and video couldn’t  be closer to the current reality  of what young people are going through and having to deal with as they try to navigate the social pressures of social media
Get off your phones kids -Guy on his phone
Collaborating with the algorithm
I'm crying, it made a difference then, and it made the difference today. Thank you so much
this here is perfection 😲🖤
And still makes me cry.
llorando como cada vez que veía el videoclip original, y a la vez con un sentimiento de impulso para quererme más cada día y otro de unión con la gente de estos comentarios
I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderful made; wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well. Ps139,14
Christina Aguilera - Beautiful (Bullshit Version)
Literalmente este video es beautiful ❤️ muestra como incluso los niños se ven inseguros antes la influencia de las redes sociales y la superficialidad que se vive hoy en día 🥺
It touched me in my heart. For the younger ones, please be kind to yourself. Not now, but always. Im almost 50, And just started to love myself. And if I look back, it has been a waste of the little time I have in this life. 🫶🏻🫵🏻❤️
I was only 6 but I still remember how this song made me feel.. I always felt pretty when I’d hear this song 😊.. now I’m 26 and this song is still just as empowering ❤
So is es ☺️ wie @gnu es ihrer Community immer sagt ❤️
This video is making it worse
so true...
Impossível não chorar.
https://youtu.be/mdq-OqF5Y9o ❤️❤️"Don't think so much about life, Whoever has given life, he must have thought something too. Every person can become successful, Just someone gets hurt and shatters, So someone gets hurt and shines."
Wtf
The message of the song really never gets old. Kids today are so focused on gadgets and getting more insecure because of what they see on social media. Hope they enjoy being kids and play along with others.
Love it she released this after Britney said her dancers are fat
this is amazing. thanks cristina and fiona!
Social criticism in your Face. Very direct. I am impressed. Well done Miss Aguilera.👍
Good enough new version of this song’s video 👏🏼 one of my favourites from Christina ❤ I just have one question!  Where are the parents? Why are this kids always by themselves in every movie, tv show, videoclip? Is like adults and kids were living in two different worlds 🤷🏻‍♂️  Well I guess that was more than one question 🤷🏻‍♂️
What a powerful message! I've always loved the song but now I love it even more.
3:55 I always wondered if they left in the drums on purpose, or if they recorded them by accident through her headphones, cause this seems to be like an voice and piano only moment
Kinda cringe, but ok.
The sone remains as emotional and affecting as the day it was released. But, as far as this revamped video, it could have done with a lot more restraint (having characters standing still would have made for more impact) in the directing.
I could identify myself on the behaviors showed on this video, and cried facing the reality.
Poderia ter aparecido um pouquinho Christina 💖
Greaaaat decision!
This song so emotional 😢😢
Made me share a tear because how people gotta change their body under the knife to feel socially acceptable
Love u and your beautiful song, my Xtina 💖💖🤍.
Very timely .......     on a Era of social media ..... where the definition of beauty is determined by standards
Honestly the song is beautiful and one of a kind but she really couldn't make a new song for all these years but reuse the old song with a new MV... pathetic
หมดมุกแล้วหรอ ไม่ทำเพลงใหม่ละ ?
Por isso excluí minhas redes sociais, mô paz.
that was deep😍🥲
This song and video hits hard as a Father.
The difference since 20 years ago... times really have changed
this song Everlast 💞
20년전에 이노래 들으면서 완벽한 크리스티나 모습 처럼 나도 저렇게 되고 싶다고 생각하면서 들었는데… 20년만에 다시 나온 이노래는 있는 그대로의 나를 사랑하자고 하고.. 왜그리 어린 나에게 스스로 가혹했는지  눈물이 난다.. 😢
This song meant so much to so many little girls. And I hope this reaches all the right people. You guys are beautiful no matter what
Exactly the video for our times. Going for a walk....without my phone. Thanks Christine!
This one it’s the greatest one ❤
the chills I JUST GOT 😭😭😭😭 I can't stop the tears... I love this song
Crazy to see how relevant this is and how much things have changed since the OG music video-thank you,this is a great awareness
Missing some older times 🤍 I just want to say: you are beautiful no matter what they say!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
mesmo assim , essa música sempre será um gatilho. Mais empatia por favor somos seres criados do amor e para o amor não somos  venenosos...
so now im sitting here crying
ooh!  i was nervous to watch this video, Mum of two teenagers, wondering what agenda it was going to try & push on my kids.  glad to see that it's essentially the Beauty that we have all been given, best realised, through True LOVE & Respect.
I like it but I do wish there was more of an inclusion of all ages.  You can keep the focus on kids, but others are struggling with pressures of social media, too.
Tears. You did such a good job with this ♡
I cant stop crying.
En Perú, hace unos días, una niña de 12 años cayó desde un cuarto piso en un intento de suicidio, aun no se sabe si sobrevivirá. Su padre dijo que le hacían bullying en su escuela, se burlaban de su cuerpo, de su cabello, etc. Cuando dejarán de ocurrir estas historias de tragedia y dolor.. que los padres apoyen más a hijos, que los escuchen y les hagan entender que todos somos igual de importantes. Que dejemos de juzgar a los demás y aprendamos a respetar y valorar a quienes nos rodean.
When you planning on re-releasing Dirrty ?
I immediately look in the mirror while watching this masterpiece 💗.
Fight for the children. Allow the children to speak for us. ❤
Christina Aguilera, transcends time and boundaries with this song!
💗
The song of our life.  "We are beautiful" Thank you Christina.
The moment the children play freely in the trees, I started crying. Life x
The message of this song is very timely~
Wow
❤
😔😢
Omg. This is very relevant. Thank you, Christina.
This song should be international anti-bodyshaming anthem....
I love love love this video, it explains more about what the song is really saying. Puts it in perspective. I've always struggled with my teeth, being real skinny, and not built the way I wanna be, and this video really spoke to me. Keep doing what you do Christina, your a fuckin legend and an icon!
Can’t girls like makeup and still think they’re beautiful? Stage makeup for dancers exists
Love the song and previous video. However thus video for me has lost its potential. There are much better way to show this problems in less artificial ways. Less is more
The song was already a masterpiece and now the video as well.
This is one of those songs that always reminds me it’s okay to be the girl that doesn’t like shaving her legs for gym class, or having that perfect jawline or a great tan
Wooo¡!
❤❤❤❤
I guess she isn't "beautiful" enough to be in her own videos now 😂
Essa música salvou muitas vidas. ❤️
🔥🔥🔥
This song is so powerful, thank for spreading a good message with your work 🙏🏽
This song still has the power to bring me to tears.
아이를 키우는 입장에서 이 비디오를 보고 눈물이 났어요. 내가 20대일때 나온 노래였는데 그때 이 노래는 내가 세상에 외치는 함성이었죠. 지금은 내 아이를 보호하는 마법주문 같은 노래입니다. 고마워요. 크리스티나.
This generation needed this. Love it. Felt it just as I did as a child. Thanks you Xtina❤
This song still makes me emotional. Such a powerful message 🥹💕♥️
This song helped me to cope with homophobic Jamaica, i am glad i left
its so important to let kids know that no matter what they look like, who they are, who they like and who they wanna be they are beautiful and they are accepted
<3
Is shame nothing has changed from 1st when this song came out
i hope this generation listens to this. We are all beautiful in our own way. Beauty has no standards.
CRYING AT 5AM 😭 This song meant the world to me. What a beautiful time to re-release, the video got me. 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
😩
Loved this song and can’t believe it’s been 2 decades. Would have been great if she re-recorded it as well.
I needed this.
To straszna prawda naszych czasów 😪😪😪
Was the message for the youth to literally go outside and touch grass?? 😂
The difference in the videos during different periods of time is unreal. Such a sad world we live in 🥺 still one of the most beautiful songs. ❤️
i just wish there were actually overweight people in there other than that one person . Hits the same
I am crying!! all the pills that i took just to be thin, all that starvation so i wont get fat! This song hits so hard! I love you Christina. I am forever grateful for this song! ❤ WE ARE BEAUTIFUL IN EVERY SINGLE WAY
Words can bring me down but I’m trying to not let them.
The original was much better.
Perfectly timed re-release!!! ❤️❤️❤️ I didn't understand this when it came out when I was still in gradeschool but now I realise just how relevant it is no matter what era ❤️❤️❤️
Remember that our imperfection make us perfect and unique.
Well, everyone in the video looks like a model what the heck... you are beautiful no matter what they say. WHO IS GONNA SAY THEY'RE NOT? Well...
At 3:25 when the two young men are hugging, that made me tear up a little. Many boys grow into men who live lives of non-intimacy, not knowing how to give and receive love, because these behaviours were not only not modelled for them but they actively denied and even shamed for "not being man enough". Everybody should be able to ask for a hug when they need one ❤
It's sad that I grew up listening to this song, and other songs like it by tlc and pink etc, but nothings changed, if anything it got worse. The contrast between this video and the original even says it all. The age group affected by these aesthetic pressures has only gotten younger and now their youth has been stripped by social media etc. You could think there's been improvement with the likes of "body positivity" and "diversity" but its all a farce. Everyone's directly compared to someone better online, how can you ever truly accept yourself in such a climate?
seeing these young children forcing themselves to fit these narrow, impossibly adult beauty standards and knowing that really is what reality is like for kids now... I got chills. Perfectly sums up our image obsessed times.
Parents shouldn’t let kids have access to computers , iPads, phones etc til they’re adults or whatever or put in limits for how long the use them - social media is BS
as a 14 year old girl I am bawling. this music video and this song are so beautiful <3 love the message
This is so deep. Thank you Xtina
Cash grab
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🇹🇼 HAPPY GAY PRIDE IN TAIWAN🏳️‍🌈❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
On point, Christina. On point.
Wow.....I really needed to hear this song again, it's been a long time. And the video is so very true sadly..since society is based so much online now. It messes with our mental health and sense of self at times. What a great reminder that no matter what, everyone is beautiful.
This makes me feel emotional, as a 90s kid. Nostalgia is realll one of the best songs. Remember the rivalry of the QUEENS of POP Christina an Britney hahaha!
Thank you Christina, I really needed to hear this incredible song again. It's like a really warm big hug from my grandmother that I've missed and needed. 😢🌻❤
❤
I clicked instantly shouting to my boyfriend : HOLD MY FUCK UP, HOLD IT
what a beautiful song. oh kids, love yourself and don't ever let anyone bring you down. hell no. not today!
This song meant a lot to my sister, who was only 11 years old when it came out. Unfortunately, she passed away this year, and we had a saxophonist perform this song as he led her coffin to the ceremony. I know, if she was still with us, she would say how fitting and important it is to have this song re-released at the time.   thank you for producing such an amazing song that impacts so many. x
but those celebrites themselves set a ridiculous beauty standards..
Loved the original video because it caused a major case of the feels. Not ashamed to say this one made my eyes fill.
im not crying im just crying
Happy that I had a childhood witjout a smartphone, like the kids in the ending!
Wilkommen in der Realität... Im Heute!  Und herzlichen Glückwunsch zur Erkenntnis, dass wir uns und unsere nachkommende Generation völlig Zerstören.  Eigentlich wissen es fast alle... Aber wir schauen zu und machen mit.  Wir haben es doch so weit getrieben!? Wir können es auch wieder unterbrechen... Stattdessen werden schon Kinder von klein auf mit so Müll zugestopft
Semua cantik,indah,dan berharga sebelum bullying hadir
This is song is 4 me
Social networks contribute too much psychological traumas every day, but few people realize it
Deep video ilustration,,, i like it
No hemos aprendido nada desde que Chris nos dijo que éramos (somos) hermosos, muy al contrario, esto ha empeorado. Qué triste que el marketing, las redes sociales y la poca empatía estén ganando. Ojalá encontremos la forma de revertirlo y que en 20 años más esto haya mejorado. This needs to change...
Hoy más que nunca necesitamos este himno universal tanta “presión” por las redes sociales que nuestra generación lo ve como normal 😩
This is a perfect reminder. Thank you Christina for bringing this 🙏🏽 ❤️💯
Wow finally a celebrity going against transing the kids. Be proud of how you were born ✊🏼
Omg I'm weeping Christina you're a queen forever
This will still be a powerful message for younger generations for years to come.
1:06 this spot got me teary already 😭. The MV is so beautifully meaningful. I have no words to describe the whole feeling but this is just so relatable to our reality now. Every scene breaks my heart a lot.
😢
🙏💖AHAM BRAHMASMI🌏🎄 WE'RE ALL ONE🥗TAT TVAM ASI🌈LOVE IS ALL THERE IS🌅👁🌟🕉
YAAAAASSSSSSS!!!!!! 100 AKO SA KARAOKE PAG KINAKANTA KO TO EH HAHAHSHSJAJSS
This song is just what I needed this very day
Thank You to both Christina Aguilera & Linda Perry for this amazing song.
🤍✨
this 2022 version hits different nowadays, more and more people lacking of their self-esteem due the fake lifestyle of social media.
The song holds up its meaning then and until now.
for real this was a great video, well done.  real. no fake.
moral of the story = Touch Grass
An oldie but an amazing goodie.
I got chills
Thank you for this Christina!!! 💗
Dios acabo de conocer esta canción y la entendí muy bien senti una gran conexión con la canción y el video es sublime 😭💓💓💓
I THINK OF MY BABY GIRL, LOVE U ❤️ 😍 Serenity n Kenlee 💖 💓 💕 💗 ✨️ ❤️
Muy bella melodía amar uno su realidad y dar lo mejor de uno
Louder for the people in the back.
Beautiful in every way. A very poignant song video-with an amazingly positive message.👍💙
giving me goosebumps!
Massive condemnation of antisocial media, eg the one we are on right now, instagram, facebook, tiktok and so on. At each others throats courtesy of sociopaths like zuckerberg to line his wallet at the altar of 'engagement'.  This song is the war cry more so today than when it was written.
Terrible music video
Just wow
I was crying hard, and then that bit at the end gave me chills. This was very powerful and very needed. Absolutely beautiful 💜
It’s hard to believe her words when she has had so much plastic surgery she is almost unrecognizable.
Timeless 🥺💓
The message in the video is so strong.. it really shows how mobile phones affect the youth of today.
Take the phones away from the kids. Step one.
Thankyou🥺
❤️❤️❤️
Wait, she redid it?! But not newly performed. That would have been cool...
Quién no se siente identificado con alguna escena, nos ha pasado a todos
And yet Christina has had plastic surgery and veneers in that same amount of time, contributing to the issue directly herself -_- hypocrite.
So relevant. Social media could bring us down. Today. Espacilly twitter
This is making me cry
Amen. x
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
sad and dissapointed this song has only thin bodies. this song means so much to so many fat, overweight, and not thin people. also no challening of sexuality and gender norms. so many non thin, trans, and cuir children actors exist. It´s 2022. you can do better christina. still love you. just a little sad
I couldn't help but cry throughout this song. I loved it back then, still love it now. The message is even more relevant now
Seeing the kids climbing the tree is what broke me. The ONLY thing kids should be thinking about is being kids! Not their looks and certainly not their sexuality and gender either!
Powerful message and music video.
This song was so beautiful it had to re-release again
Essa música me ajudou a me amar como sou, me ensinou que há beleza na diversidade.  Que essa canção possa tocar a vida de muitos outros como tocou e ainda toca a minha vida.  Obg Christina Aguilera por nos presentear com esse hino atemporal.
Just cried my eyes out.
Whoever think of the concept for this music video, you guys are amazing! Thank you for reminding today's generation that they are all beautiful just the way they are.  The life behind every social media post is not always what you think it is.  Always take a pause, put down your phone, disconnect and finally connect to what and who really matters to you. Your life, family & friends. You enjoying your meal with your workmates. You enjoying the sunset by the bay. Do what makes you feel happy & alive.  Life didn't promise us that it'll be an easy journey, but in every storm, in every struggle, we need to hold on tight to what makes us stronger. Hold on to your faith, your family, and whatever it is that you know will help you to get back up and fight back. Never give up!  You are beautiful. Life is always glad that you are here. Thank you kind, beautiful soul. 💕
This song was so important to me as a child and now as an adult it still resonates and has such impact with the world now
This is beautiful. I’ll never forget watching the original video on TRL for the first time, I remember thinking “that’s me…I exist” as a gay boy watching in a time where “gay” was still extremely taboo it made feel like if I could just survive a little longer eventually it would all be okay. ❤
The message is so strong here.
Kinda weird though being Christina has had so much plastic surgery herself.  🤷‍♀️
This song always makes me cry, but I am so glad you redid it for this generation because I thought it was bad back then, but it’s worser because it’s affecting  our babies. I love how they was playing like children at the end. All they need to worry about is being a innocent child and teen
The way this song transcends generations 💜
Ame !! ❤
amo la cancion yy los dos videos pero que hipócrita hay q ser para hablar de autoaceptacion y estar operadisima como Cristinita
Really illustrates how children today find the process of puberty MORTIFYING. They go from dressing as a child straight to dressing up like an adult/teen, like being caught between would be a nightmare. It's pretty creepy when construction workers catcall actual tweens. It's even worse when certain children eat enough hormones to gain womanly curves before they're even teens.
I love you, i love you.. 😭😭
I completely agree with the overall message. However The real issue isn’t our phones. It’s the patriarchy. Get to the fucking root of things. Our phones are just vessels for it
So beautiful! So important! Thank you, Christina!
I was 15 years old when this song was released, I remember listening with my best friend and telling each other the lyrics everyday. I wish I kept this ritual, now I'm 36 and so depressed I don't wanna live anymore and a big part of it is because I hate myself and the way I look.
She have re-recorded it as well as reshot the video❤
A few days ago I wrote about mental health problems experienced by teenagers or children born in the 2000s.  And I also wrote that the cause of poor mental health problems is the progress of the times and social media is one of them.  It turns out that this song is the same as what I wrote about the current state of teenagers.
Don't get me wrong. Great video, great message. But.....  I do wonder: did she bother to record it anew, or did she just put the old recording under the new video? It sounds eerily similar to the existing studio version.....  Also, I could have done without the explicit moral/plug at the end. Better to leave the message just as the video alone.  But other than those things, it is still a great video.
De los videos más lindos  con un mensaje TAN claro que veo después de tanto tiempo, GRACIAS!!
Flop taylor swift and bts better
Love the message and how they portrait. ❤
🫶🫶🫶
this was still casted as a "body diversity" "racially diverse" and "LGBTQ characters" project - all advertising BS, real life has nothing to do with this - this is NORMATIVE and RISK-FREE
We live in a society
great idea to rerelease a more modern video for this song... however, can't help but notice that there was only one plus-sized person in the video, we didn't get to see them decide "no I am beautiful". there was no representation of other bodies other than colour. great to see a modernised version of the MV, but a  little more modern representation would have been great to see too
Frank's cover was better.
Such a BEAUTIFUL messege you send to us!!
Mi ha fatto commuovere esattamente come quando uscì la prima versione. Stupenda ❤
My sister used to be the victim of social media; she was one of beauty influencer, therefore she always tried to make her image perfect. She also envied others who she thought more beautiful than her. It stressed her out. Finally, she stopped and quit her social media.
Clipe perfeito! Retrato perfeito dos anos que estamos vivendo
Powerful
This was really needed. To see that even as time passes... the human worry remains the same, just different outlets and platforms. Eres grande Christina!!!!
Time flies 😅😢
Mrinding banget denger lagunyaaa
It has a good message, but let’s be honest, the people they used are still the people considered beautiful by society, not the “outliers” 😅  The kids looked all so precious and beautiful. But not much diversity imo. They could’ve added persons with physical disabilities, people who are fat (I mean almost everyone was thin in the video, which could be the point that like everyone’s trying to be thin and pretty, but still no diversity in their representation), etc.  Just my opinion though.
Are they the kids from dance moms
Eat balanced. Exercise regularly. Live diligently. Then you'll become beautiful inside and outside.
History.
necessary ❤️
💗💗
More songs need to be revived and re-released.  Shania Twain's "What a Way to Want to Be" rings true now more than ever.
This is such a sad and horrible truth but it really is important that it is talked about
Razor
Direction looks like its done by an under grad who took a gender studies class at Brown. A bit trite
Que hermoso volver a escuchar esta canción! Me hizo fuerte de chica! Y espero que este video ayude también a nuevas generaciones!
❤
This song made me  feel things at 13 and this song makes me feel even more things at 33. I am glad this was re released.  Very beautiful message that everyone needs to hear even now.
Aw taking me back to my childhood 🥹❤️
Queen
Atemporal.
I love the idea and at the same time i feel like Christina in her life is not coherent with the message she is trying to proyect. It would be nice that people start doing what they say. That's the real way to make it happen.
Somewhat ironic that pretty much all actors are conventionally good-looking.
❤
Lots of great songs with powerful messages have come out between the years of the original and this one, I'd highly recommend Mr MTV by Nothing More, very powerful message about how society is built more on WANTs rather than NEEDs.
Lastima ella no sale
Shout out to the redheads in this video!!!! 😊
Like you are all beautiful and who cares what people say there just bullies there unhappy in there in life’s this song is such a good message for people who don’t love them selfs and they don’t know how important they so just know you're important loved cared for and special.
Xtina should have followed her own words and not have that much tweaks on her face 😞
I only saw one remotely plus-sized kid in this whole video.
Замечательный клип👍✨
Bravo christina!
sad world 🌎
U were perfect then and again brilliantly amazingly perfect now again. <3
Love the new Video. You All are so Beautiful ❤️
Cried like a baby not gonna lie!
.................................okie the olden days
Then and now, this song will always make me goosebump.
Thank you Christina
Heres the lyrics enjoy beautiful people ❤️❤️  Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is? You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side 'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This hits so much hard then it did in 2002. The message of this song needs to be heard more now then 20 years ago. Thank you Christina for this amazing gift you have given us again.
Leave my blue and whites out of this. I don't need the Adderall shortaged coming after my Vyvanse 🤣
love you forever and this song was so important to me when I was young!
Hermoso...otra vez
tuani pero ella es la 1era que se inyecta!
🥺❣️🫶🏼
I’m in tears. this is so needed today❤️🙏🏾
everybody’s beautiful ❤️ please guys take care of yourself! you guys are amazing
Tan real y apropiado para todos los tiempos, faltaron las niñas y niños hormonados y con cuerpos sanos mutilados por la falsa promesa trans. Es lo mismo que ésto, es no dejar en paz la infancia.
It’s North West there??
Powerful video and much needed❤👍
Doeu🥺
This will never not bring up mean girls.
Necesaria más que nunca
Brutaaaaal ! Gracias Christina 😘
❤️👑👍🏻
Yes, kids. Get off the phone and go play outside dammit.
in tears
This song made me cry a lot as a child, and now as a young adult
I didn't know which direction this redo was gonna take. But I am glad it's in the direction of children should be children and not focus on the pressure of society
the best song ever ♥️
😢
okay well now i'm sobbing
Hope the people it is intended for are watching. It's weird because we know what the problem is but we still keep sinking into the quick sand of issues.
ce clip merite un oscarrr
OMG 😱 , there could not be a better time to re-lease this song .this song is message for new generation …❤
❤
What a shit! I Mean...
0:28 What was happening the guy exactly? Sorry for my question. I know the meaning behind but I couldn't understand that
It's funny because this video is also a part of the problem. People will watch it, feel emotional, but the emotions are once again induced through a digital medium, so it will suck you right back in. The Matrix is incapable of releasing you, it will always come up with a new way of making you feel liberated but after that experience, right back into the matrix you go, it's been like that for years. Even you, reading my comment here is a part of you still sleeping and if you respond, you will get even more entrenched into your sleep. There is a way to get out, but you can only find it in a very quiet place deep within your own heart, where no external content is present. Good luck.
It's ok, i guess.. It's not as striking as the original version
The ending made me cry... when they finally all just played together like they should be.
Aw I wish she would have re-recorded the vocals...
The most beautiful thing about this song is also the saddest. It’s the fact that this song will always be needed.
👏
young boys like that should not compare them selfs to grown men that are lifters it takes time to get like that
Okay, wasn't planning on crying today. Thanks.
Thank you🤍
🥺🥺🥺
Thank you Christina Aguilera
Nice one Christina.
Wtf?! 😔 that made me cry realizing what we have become. And that poor lil boy with razor and medication who seemed like he was always alone.
the every day struggle of everyone's life..even though people are strong on their opinion they will always have something to say.but "words can't bring you down" at all
The fact that it is not social media that is to blame, but the fashion, music and porn industry .......and the society that regards this as a development is the real problem. It's not like it's been such a problem since yesterday, only via social media it now affects everyone and spreads faster….🙃🙃
This video was stunning! The only thing that would have made it even better would have been to include trans kids.
Real inclusive how almost every kid in that video was super thin.... real eye opener at what really is the issue in society... the entretainment industry has set the super model standards and keeps doing so.
This is beautiful
Just perfect.
Ridiculously perfect time to release this. I do think the original video was better but I like how it shows how people SO SO young are affected.
This song has always had such an important message but more so now than ever in this day and age especially for kids and teenagers the  message at the end of this song could not be more true so much has changed in the last 20 years since this song was released social media has become such a massive part of young people's lives but sadly for a lot of the wrong reasons and it does need to change for the sake of their well-being and mindset
Where are you Christina Aguilera ?
Wow this song is such a classic, the message is so necessary especially during these times! 🙏🏾❤️💯
I needed this. Thank you.
Who's responsibility? Who's responsibility? Whoa responsibilities? Who's responsibility? Who's responsibility? Whoa responsibilities?
Children not growing well nowday.. Who's responsibility?
Perfect Song of humanity
I love you Christina! ❤
Beautiful, Reflection, Fighter. Xtina was always a champion for loving yourself.
Thank you.
Not me sat here crying
I really like the MV.
👍👍👍👍
:))
This song is a blessing
Children should not even have phones, or unsupervised access to the internet or a tablet period!! And parents wonder why they can’t Handle their kids. Bye!!!
❤
And yet, all the girls in this video are pretty much in a similar shape.
so she can get away with all this but taylor can't get away with stepping on a scale??
Beau clip et très parlant pour toutes Générations....🙏
today the song is more important than ever. all the body cult on the internet. instagram, facebook fuck 2.0! live in and with the reality of our beauty.  share the video to all
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
What a shit video compared to her 2002 release 😂 I was expecting some woke garbage
That was sweet
I remember being a little “ boy “ coming home from school after being bullied by the adults and kids for being different … a different That I couldn’t control.. this song would carry me away from all that pain .. I remember just sitting on my bed crying in the mirror hating the reflection .. now I’m 22 and the woman I always thought I would be.. I still struggle. But I love my reflection , I love what I see in the mirror now
❤🇲🇽
your message is good but on the other hand it is hypocritical. how many filters and fillers and botox do you use, christina? shouldnt you be a role model with wrinkels and whatever to be ok?
love ❤
💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
not at all to take away from this message that is so important children and teenagers.. just noting that seeing the body builder weight lifting guy made me think about how he mightve been affected by this same thing. its really difficult for adults who watched all this internet social media stuff ramp up in real time in such a toxic culture. i cant imagine how difficult it must be to be born into this high point of toxicity and know nothing else. im not into the condescending " phones are bad" blanket statement / judgements, but in rejecting that very unhelpful critique of a real issue, i ended up undermining this fucked up digital internet culture at times. with full sincerity "touching grass" can be really grounding. its crazy how much going outside or really just doing anything besides interacting with and looking at screens keeps you afloat. peace and love to u. reader <3
Eternal classic...!!! Masterpiece...!!!
Bruh this song is so over done and let it die
crying
It's sad that still decades later we still have to teach this lesson. This song is such an inspiration. Humans spend so much time seeking others validation instead of realizing that beauty comes in  so many forms
Absolutely incredible. Christina you did good on this one. I applaud you.
Necessary
🖤
thank you for this beautiful message
Don't look at me Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is? You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side 'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
Doesn’t Christina have surgeries herself?
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
glad to finally see people realising that letting our kids have access to social media (and mobile phones in general) is a child protection issue. kids should be playing outside, no screen can supplement the richness of the education that nature gives us, no matter how advanced the technology gets.  I have very few memories of my teen years thanks to the amount of scrolling i did. that's a decade of my life used up and filled with content i did not need to be seeing. i was addicted and frankly still am. i hope we can prevent other teens and children from the same experience.
This song and video is everything. Perfect for 2022.
I'm actually so surprised and relieved that this is not gender affirmation themed
Wow this is so needed and a very powerful message! Go Christina❤️
あなたはあなたのままで充分美しいよ。 他人と比べないで。  そんなメッセージを感じ取ったなぁ。 生きづらいよね。。。
Youtube puts this video on the very first line of my page… I don’t know if this is s coincidence or no, but after getting shouted and talk-trashed by my very own mother, i am very much need this positivity.. thank you 🥺😭😭
I always think of the Mean girls talent show ❤️.
Good karma to you Dead Mike  you pick great music
Nice to hear ☺️
This video should encourage parents to get their kids OFF of social media. I had to be that parent that said NO. My son hated me. He’s a very well adjusted successful 23 yr old who rarely posts anything online and spends a lot of time outdoors. GET YOUR KIDS OFF SOCIAL MEDIA! They will thank you later.
hermosa versión, los visuales son increíbles 🙅🏻🙅🏻🙅🏻
This version means a lot to people. Thank you.
This is so beautiful ❤️ I'm crying my eyes out!
Bagus banget
i am beautiful
There are no words, this song strike in the point of the poor society we live in.
Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain, I'm so ashamed  I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down... Oh no So don't you bring me down today  To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?  You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down...oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune Full of beautiful mistakes  And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side  We are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  Oh, yeah, don't you bring me down today, yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down ooh... today
SOCIAL MEDIAL RUIN OUR LIVES! SOCIETY! AND THE HUMAN RACE!
What a beautiful video
It's so beautifull, I love it 👏👏👏
meaningful mv, reflecting nowadays society and values Be yourself and be true because we are beautiful
My heart....
😭😭😭😭
Love the 2022 revamp! Timeless lyrics
Mephisto
The world needs a few more reminders like this. There is nothing more beautiful than a little self-confidence, so pay no mind to the haters, know your worth and shine ✨️
this is the best❤❤
❤️‍🔥
Cada niño debe vivir su etapa, no hay porque compararse con los demás.
blame it on the Kardashian effect
my body my choice
Im glad i was a teenager in the early 2000’s , i cant imagine how hard has to be being a teen in this filter , fake social media world  Somos hermosos no lo olviden 💜
you can be you if you have a lot of money.
So needed. Crazy times..
I love the Christina included very young girls and boys in the video. We all think about teenagers but obsessing about our body start much earlier.
I remember watching the original video when i was 8 and it resonated so deeply cause i already felt ugly/not good enough at such a young age..and it still makes me emotional 20 years later
I never get bored of this song. Beautiful is the best song and the best album ever for me. Thank you for creating the song and the mv, our world needs this so bad. Lastly, I love you Christina 💚
I cried beautiful tears when they climbed on the tree and played 😭
damn
Thank God for her speaking up
👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋👋
This song will be always important, this should be a motto for everybody. Being imperfect doesn't make us less beautiful!
Yas! Get outside and play. Nature heals. Community is important. Build those relationships, including the one with yourself. ❤️
I will never stop falling in love with this album.
je kiff
cool mec
😍😍😍😍😍😍 Thank you!!!! thank you, thank you!. Words can't bring me down, not today! nevermore!!!
Real tear jerker
I love how they put “ugly “ people haha There is no one reply ugly in the video but anyways 🤣
Wow! Let kids be kids. Give them a swing not a screen
Bastante hegemonicos los pibitos para ser un video con tal mensaje...
C'est rare une chanteuse intemporelle qui nous offre une si belle chanson intemporelle, la réalisation du clip est magnifique le message est clair c'est un régal d'émotions légitimes, MERCI.
People its just stupid cause they spend his life in the phone. i dont even got social medias now. I mean. Life its just more than that. Peace.
Wowwwwwwwwwww amei! tnks Xtina
This song is always relevant! Thanks for re-releasing this. ❤
I appreciate a rerelease, and I love this song but "2022 Version" that's some click bait shhii
This message seems to be even more important nowadays than it was back then. THINGS NEEDS TO CHANGE!
❤❤❤❤❤
Cute, but honestly think they could have done better in casting kids further from the conventional beauty standards. These kids all look like models, not normal kids. Why not cast some kids with disabilities? Facial differences? not all super skinny (with one exception), gender non-conforming kids. In addition to better portraying the message you're trying to send it would be great to give kids of all stripes the opportunity and exposure that this video provides.
I m confused... The message is beautiful and all but, what Christine does to her body sends a completely different message, does it not?
Too bad , Christina did plastic surgery herself. She was so beautiful and perfect the way she was
I find it SO hypocritical. She was (is) very uncommonly beautiful: tiny waist, huge breasts (if they are even true), beautiful big blue eyes, long slim legs, pouty lips. She pointed so much on her body and specifically on looking perfect. I remember looking at her pictures and admiring her perfection and feeling like an ugly duckling. It is ridiculous that she comes out with this song again, I found it ridiculous even in the 2000s. It is seriously ridiculous that she sings "you are beautiful, no matter what they say" when she is part of the problem. Maybe she did not have much power over how much photoshop they were adding on her pictures, but I don't think it's much of an excuse, she went along with it for many years. I have been diagnosed with body dysmorphia, had to take medications, it ruined many years of my life. And yes, Christina, it is in part also your fault.
I'm touched.
goosebumps!   right time for the moment
Thank you 💕
Ooh
The message is powerful in my eyes as a parent, I hope my teen girl can share the same opinion though I highly doubt if she will.
So creepy
Tão necessário esse vídeo clipe! Excelente! 👏🏻👏🏻
que fort 🫂❤️‍🩹
Don't look at me Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?

Would be great if she wasn't using plastic surgery herself.
llore 😪 que linda canción, que hermoso video 😍
I grew up listening to Christina Aguilera and "Beautiful" is one of her best songs ever! BUT - and there's a huge "but" here - BUT all this awareness about mental health issues and eating disorders... it's so awkward coming form an artist that became "a plastic" since a young age! She's in her 40s now and the muscles in her face don't move at all! What about her big boobs and bottom, but everywhere else she is so thin and skinny and perfect? How many plastic surgeries did she had already????? And now she's releasing the same song 20 years later to teach as what????? Feel free to hate me, I don't care. BUT a plastic person cannot talk about - or sing about - how much social media affects our common lives these days.
Totally agree w this song, i dont even use fb, extremely hate tiktok ! Too harmful!
Is black girl is Kim K's daughter?
The message is clear, get the children off the phones.
love love love, what a timeless song!! This video is on point
It’s like society romanticizes being unhealthy nowadays. You’re obese and soon going to die from a heart attack? BEAUTIFUL! You work out and eat clean? HOW AWFUL!!!
Not even a new recording of the song. Same track given an updated video is a quick easy way to make some money.
Vous dites ça mais vous avez casté presque que des gamins qui passent bien à l’écran... c'est tellement hypocrite je suis déçue. Je préférais le premier clip
If this is anyone's first time listening, please never forget ❤
Those pills are for soar throats and to hell against ulcers or when taking NSAID’s
This is amazing.  I remember when this came out when I was little.
Just accept youself and you'll find how beautiful you are ❤️✨
So hypocritical that the ones who influenced Generations for decades in that way ,now suddenly criticize what they have caused its not social media itself its the stars who send out this message to the world
Influencers need to take a look at what they are doing to the kids of the future too busy looking fake its sad ;(
This song its for eternity ,the world now need this music again
this video really said “touch grass”
One of my favorite song ever....❤❤❤
The only way to live in a judgemental society is to be yourself no matter what we do we can't  make everyone happy so make yourself happy Always do things that makes you happy without caring about other's opinions
While not really a fan of a Xtina, this came out when I was around 12 years old. At the time, we didn’t have iPhones or social media, but being a scrawny awkward kid who was bullied through high school songs like this helped me feel less alone. Crying watching this in 2022, that we still even NEED this song. That the problems children face in order to just be able to love themselves have become 1000x worse.  My heart breaks for this new generation, the generations before them have failed them so miserably. Kids are the future and we need to protect them better.
Right now this song hits differently for me, for us. Hard time when I hear this song , singing loud cry like a baby. I like to watch social media. But I don’t focus some people’s “better body” or “good looking” compares to me. Like I don’t care. I believe we all beautiful if we care ourselves. Don’t care other people.
Omg yess!!! Cant wait till im a little older and have more financial resources so i can re-release some of my old songs im not 100% happy with better quality, professional videos and production. Thanks for inspiring me today Christina! X
I can´t believe this song is already 20 years old. I was 10 back then and sure glad socal media and smart phones didn´t exist! The final part of the video with the children playing in the sun is how it should be! But thanks to fantastic parents of this century, children are born with smartphones and tablets in their hands now. What a time to live in.
Amongst the best celebrities to speak this out...! Loved it!
♥
YES! THIS IS SOULDEEP MASTERPIECE THAT SHOULD BE RELEASED EVERY YEAR!!!
The MAP’s are loving this one
Your agenda is way to apparent in this one. Please stop normalizing the sexualization of children in the media. It’s gross
I know this video was made from the standpoint of an American, but it's crazy how these kinds of pressures are present all over the world. The shocking scene of the kids heading in for plastic surgery was unfortunately realistic... in South Korea quite a few kids start getting surgery as young as 13, especially if they're in the entertainment industry
I think a lot of people forget to love themselves and only be themselves. All these social media "influencers" don't help so be yourself and stop being like them. You'll be much more happy and in love with yourself.
😭😭😭😭♥️
it's been ages and I'm still jamming to this song
A very timely and very necessary reminder. This will always be one of my favorites by her.
Children playing in the park, thats how their childhoods should be. Not spent with a screen in hand thats provides a doorway into the dark things of this world. Children are literally raised by those they watch which is why there's an epidemic of kids being groomed into the delusion that they can change their gender. If they didn't have access to these suggestions, the majority of them would be able to grow up healthy and whole.
Links her website and the main picture is a highly photoshopped image of her lol. With her thousands of dollars worth of plastic surgery.
WOW!!!!!
I like it sometime😊
ok, but... where's the gay kiss?
crying
i miss this song
Perfect
beautiful
In tears, in pain for what is our society building. Pray for ours children they deserved better parents, families, values, life. Please share this vídeo!
Made me cry soon as I saw the thumbnail 😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤ I love Christina a million more times for this
.
👍💜💙💚🧡💛❤️💖💝💘💗
❤️🥺🙏
Revamp in modern era but still, I like it the song, "Beautiful" ever like in the past too, thank you, Christina Aguilera for this memory lane video again, geez! 🙏😍😭💗
The first half of this music video is so dark. I love it. I find society is definitely focusing on the wrong things. Yes, beauty, aesthetics, bodybuilding is great as uplifting hobbies. But the alienation of hyperindividualised and atomised capitalism, that's the root issue. The despiritualised and profaned existence of modernity, another issue.
Instantly getting goosebumps😩🙌🏾 all generations need this song!❤️
as the old and gold :3
Still such a powerful message and much needed for our youth today as much as it was needed back then ❤❤❤
👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏  💯
Still hits the spot ❤
This hit way too hard. Sad to think things have only gotten worse for us in the past 20 years thanks to social media
i feel like social media truly has made beauty standards more rigid than ever, it's just cleverer at marketing it now
Stripped is one of my fave albums of ALL time. From spawning hits and bops to being one of the most cohesive albums ever, it is timeless and I even put the cd on years after release before spotify was even a thing. Pa Mis Muchachas took me back to that era of Christina having a solid song, career-wise I hope Christina can release another album on par with Stripped.
i am crying. i don't know why.. but maybe because it hits home on everyone's journey to self-love
Oh my goodness this is my favorite song all time🥺💖 thank you Xtina
Sad I have to hear Andrew in this even it's for a good cause
Omg the kids playing on the tire swing 🥲🥲
oh god, i can`t believe it was 20 years ago... i was 14 years old. Christina thank you so much for your contribution!
Literally almost every societal issue in a single music video.
This is NEEDED
one of the greatest works of all time
Legendary song ❤
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🥲❤️
Loved this song on its first release and love it still ❤
Feels brand new although the message still remains the same. Timeless gift.
🙌🏼 always!
I teared up at the part where I saw the children playing outside. That is what they must do. To be free. To enjoy their precious childhood. It breaks my heart to see how our precious children so young gets subjected to the constraints of our society. Children working, children caged in technology... Desensitized, jaded so early.
The most powerful lyrics in this generation is this! ❤️❤️❤️ im crying
I am so happy this video and song is released this year! Even if it’s an old song, the message is just perfect for the present generation. Everyone is beautiful but because of social media and the world, a lot of pressure is put on everyone to be perfect… to look perfect in the world’s standards. But truth is, we are all made unique and made beautiful in our own ways and everyone needs to be able to see that - no matter the ethnicity, the body, the image, the style. Kudos to Christina Aguilera, to the director of this MV and to the whole team involved in making this. Raising awareness and reminding us in such a well-crafted creative way!❤🎉
This song is beautiful! This is great video!
My fav song 😭
Christina is the only person who understands equality... long live the queen!
Детки❤
I’m at a point where my life’s either falling apart or together. It’s getting hard to stay positive and motivated. I’m so glad I found this 💜
Sad though that Christina herself has gone under plastic surgery many times. Her appearance contributes to the same fucked up system she is criticizing. No woman her age could still look like a twenty something without any kind of beauty treatment.
God bless  ❣️For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” John3,16
wow now that is what a timeless song is like
Wow, that black girl is very beautiful. ❤❤❤
Yes all day song so true here
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Simplemente impresionante.
This song has always hit me hard and this video version with the kids is even more impactful 🥹❤️
Beautiful and so so powerful. I love the diversity and inclusivity. Universal experiences of insecurity are so sad but what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger. ❤
LOUDER!!!!!!!!!!
Never know why Brittany was more popular than her Christina's vocals and lyrics are just more powerful hands down
I’m in tears 😭  love this song since 20 years ago ❤️❤️❤️ 大愛
The world needs this song and music video. I think this is the most relevant problem for young people
this generation needs this to be a reminder. being beautiful is you, not what others say about you
I mean this is all great my love but I somehow can’t keep seeing these kind of statements from people who have changed their face 50 times themselves. So they are not an issue who started this culture but all the little mini Christina’s who took it to social media? That’s why artists are called people of influence, cause we gotta realise our influence goes beyond some things. But back in the day all these super influential artists like Christina or Britney were denying their power of influence saying things such as “I just do my thing, I am not responsible for what little girls do” - no bebe you are. If you don’t want to be, then don’t be in the spotlight. But we have way too many people who love the spotlight for its power and glam but not its responsibility. It’s like politics everyone wants the throne but nobody wants to shoulder the responsibility that comes with being given the privilege to LEAD. So they just lead carelessly and then make a video to condemn the culture they helped build.
Great
this song becomes more relevant even today. Back then I thought its just gonna get better but it just got worse in a different way.
One of the everlasting song..
amen
The most relevant song until this day. Listening to this as an adult, hits differently.
😢
I love you just the way u are
IM CRYING SM
This song is really fits "the social medias - influencers - filters toxic era" nowadays. Beautiful has always been and will always be one of my fave of Tina's. ♥♥♥
just pure beautiful voice and lyrics <3
Do children even play happily like this anymore?
Beauty standards shouldn't confine us in a box.  This is still as beautiful as the first time I heard it
wow it speak more louder and louder
Bit disappointing that it's the same version of the original song, cause the original video is already so powerful and hit so many different areas at once (and it's still relevant to today). A new version would fit this new perspective in my opinion.  Still a great job regardless.
This world too harsh to me. No one tell me i m beautiful.
so glad she did this, we need this in 2022!
one of the reasons why I prefer to be following art related or simply just aesthetic pages on all my sns acc and not more than one celeb (just a fave singer) & most def not influencers; is to keep my safe space away from unwanted insecurities. one minute you can be just fine and okay with your life but seeing one "beauty guru" can destroy  that peace. one influencer vid gloating what they have, can make you want things you never really needed in the first place. it's sad, but that's the reality of this social media saturated world.  best you can do is create your safe haven.
It’s disgusting that we need this video,  but damn! we need it so much! Thanks for re-releasing Christina
I really loved this song, but now i even love it more...❤
A+,Christina
To be fair mind xtina been under the knife and injections 💉
Yeah but... Christina's career has profited from these exact same beauty standards 🤷‍♀
So true... Social media is toxic and they're earning money on insecurities.
Emotional ❤
wow , this is so powerful. thank you for making this music video ♥
It didnt move me :/
Don't look at me  Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed  I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today  To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?  You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today  No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes  And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side  'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
i needed this
The music video made me cry......
The impact of this song is Legendary! Beautiful! Timeless!
Yeah i could buy it if christina had not any surgery or tons of makeup on her face
Being a kid in these social media days is really hard 😢
Wow I got goosebumps 👁️👄👁️❤️
This is a beautiful song and a beautiful concept, but what would have been even more beautiful is using real life kids not models. It hits a bum note for me on diversity and true adolescence. A missed opportunity for a re-release with a hard-hitting message, especially in today's world.
True that social media destroy the world
2022 version🥲.. so many memories coming back.. im glad to hear this again..
anti Smartphone Filter
Hizo esta canción pensando en el futuro" que cosas que la escuche cuando se estrenó hace tantos años y ahora encaja perfectamente con lo que sucede a diario en redes. Oro 🙌
Wow ❤
This video was recommended to me by youtube. I didn't listen for 10 years her voice.
in the end , it will be our heart shine everything ,thats make all beautiful
I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.   (Revelation 3:13-14) - We are all sinners. Believe in Jesus Christ, Repent and be saved.
❤️
This song still gives me the strength as it gave me 17 years ago when I first listened to it and I feel even more today
Great message, but it would've been even better if LGBTQIA+ youth we're also represented. 😔
Hmmm
POWERFUL
This is decent but the original version was stronger with more gritty topics.
A year after this was originally released, I was sectioned for four months with anorexia. I remember another, much sicker, girl in the hospital would literally play this on repeat and I would hear it echoing into my room. I would hardly speak to the other girl, as we both hardly spoke to anyone but the hearing song made me feel slightly connected to her and her pain, I wanted her to get better and stop feeling what I was feeling. When the song played, my overwhelming loneliness soften just a little, as I briefly understood it wasn’t just me struggling with my emotions and intense dislike for myself.  I feel like songs like this often help us give a voice for our experiences whilst we can’t talk. The artist lends us theirs until we find our own, until we find our words. It’s one of the ways we can put some of the puzzle pieces together. I see music is a vessel for that, and therefore holds us in our most lonely hours, numbing the pain briefly, helping us through the night. By morning, we may have a little better understanding of our experiences or maybe we just had a brief painkiller.  But the connection to another, knowing somewhere out there, is trying to work out the same vortex of emotions inside, is one of the most important things music can give us.  It breaks my heart that kids are going through the same cycle as I did, and that the world is encouraging it much more with social media, rather than finding a way to reduce the harm it’s causing. We may heal but there is damage that will always remain from it.
christina slayed once again
ho my god girl! It's so Actual! I love that song!
Hoping she will release a new MV in 2042 🥰🥰
Thank you so much for your efforts. It's so true
This is even more relevant in today’s society ❤️🥺 thank you Christina ❤️
20 years later, the message is still exactly the same!
It sucked to be FAT then & it sucks to be FAT  now. OBESE OBESE OBESITY this is such a blergh social media thing
This is my No.1 favourite song of her. So beautiful and meaningful.
I'm not crying, you're crying
The bleeding phone at the end. Chilling. Anyway thank you for this song and the message it brings
It's great! Mother nature is beautiful without cosmetics...❤Hello from Ukraine​💙💛🇺🇦​, thank you for your support in these difficult times 🥰
chante sa a ak videyo mizik sa a trè alè e mwen espere mesaj sa a pral depase nan chak ak tout moun nan nou, akseptasyon ak lanmou pwòp tèt ou se sa nou bezwen.
never thought this mv would mame me cry ... why are we doing this to ourselfs.. 😢
True ToT
I cried!!
oh yeah, this is why we need artists.
Honestly hope every child plays and watches this music video before they think of changing their gender, Which we all know still makes you the same gender that you were anyways...
Social media is also affecting adults negatively. It is contributing to and amplifying hate, bigotry, extremism etc. Social media needs to be regulated like it is with any other form of media.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
The first video came out it was so controversial to have gay people kissing on TV and anorexia. She really did this for the new generation on social media and it's brutal as the first was. Not many artist can do that twice
<3
I really love this song, and with this version, it has given it more light into the deeper issue that lies in our current generation and that is the pressure brought by the standard of beauty that we are exposed to because of social media. Thank you for this wonderful message😇🙏🙏🙏
This is ICONIC moment 👋🏻
jlo outsold
Wish people would play this song for all the confused kids that thing changing gender will fix all their problems.
20 years after and I feel the same when I hear this song. You're all beautilful ♥
Love this
❤️
My heart 😭
Too bad the whole cast fits the beauty "standard" the song is trying to break.
This song really had to come back, the times we are living in today we need it... I hope i can touch GenZ harts like it did for Millennials, this song made us love and understand our real power ❤️
Art.
This is beautiful
Ésta canción sigue manteniendo la misma maravillosa manera de luchar contra los estereotipos impuestos por un prejuicio idealista. ME ENCANTA ES UNA MARAVILLA.
everyone liked that
Thank you Christina!!! Just thank you ❤❤❤
Beautiful is depend on our heart and our act and our mouth
i always used to play this song everytime i open my eyes in the morning and now its been a days before i discover this new music video,btw thank you for this ❤
oh what a lovely video
Re-listening to this with a now teenage daughter and a son just starting puberty...a whole new meaning. This song aged so well. 💛
This 2022 version proves,  yet again that the song is one of a masterpiece that human made. Simply beautiful, time resistant.
so needed right now!!!
Perfect video clip, I worry about the effects on young impressionable kids growing up having social media photo shopped and surgically enhanced people shoved down their throats
Es curioso que esta canción salió a principios de los 2000's cuando el estándar de belleza eran las mujeres super flacas que usaban esos jeans casi en la pelvis, cosa por la cual las chicas se sentían insuficientes que drásticamente aumentaron los problemas de bulimia y anorexia. Ahora parece que algunas modas de los 2000's están volviendo incluidos esos tipos de cuerpos, "gracias" a Instagram y sus nuevas modelos muy flacas, con seguridad y con temor de que vuelva a aparecer la ola de desórdenes alimenticios, literalmente volviendo al pasado en los 2000, esta canción cae como anillo al dedo.
The ending of this was so dark, but beautiful. A haunting image
Not as good as before ever!!!
I’m glad they made this MV. People need to open their eyes.. Be your freaking self, don’t try to be someone else or try to please people. Just Be You.
Good thing it has a good ending
Dam man the video is sad as fuck
For starters, we were spared photo filters. Disposable cameras captured a moment and you didn't judge the moment for being imperfect or unattractive. Preserving the memory was more important than making it sexy or pretty. Kids today have been robbed of that freedom.
Gen z we are beautiful!!
😭😭
Omg, definitely the best music video I´ve seen this year
✨✨✨✨
❤
She always ❤️
Yes. Socmed is a "cancer".
🥲😍😇💛💚💜💙🧡🧡❤💛💚💜💙
i have no idea i need to hear this song now, thank you
The MV is so well done and heartfelt, literal chills! So beautifully written and sung. Our inner voice can be so harsh sometimes, this song is like a warm hug reminding us of the beauty of self acceptance :)
You know the song slaps when the comments start speaking Spanish
Beautiful song
Пипец, где ссылка на Синий синий иней, вы SW's и BLM - типы?
What a great song!! No matter what, we are beautiful!!!
Ok, BUT, of this video is about accepting that you are beautiful, no matter who or how you are, why is there only beautiful people in there??? I mean... This was the perfect opportunity to show real children, not only the black and white beaituful ones... Opportunity wasted. BTW, where are the disabled people??? Aren´t we perfect too???
I love you cristina thank you for bringing up this awareness!!! I grew up listening to your songs! And you ate my actual favorite singer!   Love your fighter 🖤
Was 20 when this came out. Am 41 scarred. Deformed changed body from having a baby. Surgical scars from life saving surgeries. This song hits harder now than when I was an insecure 20 yr old.
What a beautiful song and MV, perfect lyric.
Lol ppl r so hypocritical they tell kids to love themselves and how they look . Yet society is built upon pretty people. Society decided beauty get all the good jobs without the need to even have references . They get the actor jobs and model jobs. Movies and magazines have people with makeup or a certain beauty of body or face. Then kids watch these shows and end up thinking those actors r pretty . And the cycle continues
Why i cry
How I wish xtina attempt at 2:58 with 2022 vocals
Now if we could stop telling adults to change themselves to be prettier that would be great too.
I love you all... every bit of you, us who are hurting. Us who are lost... I love you guys 🐾🥰💞🤞🏽
Omg this song still gives me goosebumps ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Great job Christina! This version is much needed. 🙌🏽
I am beautiful no matter what they say…this is what we all needed ❤❤❤
This song was way ahead of its time.  Thank you xtina 🤍
ทนเจ็บครั้งแล้วครั้งเล่าเพื่อให้คนอื่นยอมรับ
Ah, beautiful children that look great on camera to send a message that you're beautiful just the way you are. So out of touch. I get the sentiment this is supposed to send, but it missed the mark.
This song got me through my teenage years. I remember being a young girl, contemplating on just ending it all, and hearing this song. To all young women out there, it's gonna be okay. It's hard but you're gonna get through this. You are beautiful in every single way.
We need a cast list. Several stars were born here.
This song is timelessly beautiful.
I’m crying watching and hearing this beautiful message after so many years. I remember when I was younger we can only watch this on tv and listen to the radio. No high tech cp that time yet. This song is always relevant.
This song is even more relevant now than ever
People deserve so much better, we all deserve unconditional love. I just wish everyone could be happy and love their bodies. God I can’t stop crying😢😢
I needed this tonight
What a powerfull message.. Thank you xtina.. 😍😍
😢❤
😢❤
Christiana 👑
Meaningful
I just broke down in tears. I feel the same way I did when I heard this song for the first time ❤
Thank u. I needed this.
🔥🔥
Aguilera, why you gut punching us 😭😭😭💖🔥
I am gay and I love the way I am
I love this song to the bottom of my heart, but i don't get what's wrong with bodybuilding. It helps me a lot to stay mentally stable.
after all these years, it's still relevant. iloveyou Christina Aguillera 🥰
i'm beautiful no matter what
It was a tearjerker of a video when first released in 2002 and hit me hard even then. In twenty years it still has just as much of an emotional impact as I see how social media has ramped up the reach of these harmful messages.
Gives chills to this day.  Who the fuq is WAP talking about empowerment?
<3 OMG you guys <3 ... i can FOR SURE say this: Chris has one of the greatest voices of this century
To me there is something worse than politic extremes, it's the people who watch something like this and have the nerve to say stuff like "phone bad" because they have completely normalized it in their heads
Love you 🫂
This song predicted 2022 and what young people are going through
We all needed this !!!!💏
que vídeo necessário
Love You queen ❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥👊🏽
Good song, cringe video
Such a great song!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭💗💗💗💗💗💗
It do be like this tho
Omg 😮❤
Para aquellos que crecimos escuchando ésta canción, sabemos lo difícil que ha sido llegar a ser quién somos hoy, pero aquí estamos ❤️
Was that suppose to be kim Kardashian?
This and Unpretty by TLC hit so much harder now. Glad she redid this for an audience today.
20年経ってもクリスティーナとこの曲が大好きです❤️ あなたの歌で沢山の人が救われました。ありがとう🙏
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️😭😭
I mean, was a new music video for this song really needed?!
Love the message of this song. It would have been better if they put the kids (at the end of the video playing on a tree) in simpler looking clothes instead of looking like mini Zara or A&F kids models.
Ok I love Christina and I love this song but sorry that you ruined yourself with surgeries you too so this new video doesnt have sens lol
So woke shit
WHERE IS TRANSGENDER PEOPLE?
Thank you Xtina. <3
This is one of the most beautiful songs ever! <3
Nuestra canción de adolescente de los millenial traída de vuelta para los zenteniall
34 year old me may have hemorrhoids but I sang this like the 14 year old diva I once was…
Yo since when was this women a Latina pop star?
this is one of the best songs.. <3
I still remember my 4th grade teacher in 2002 played this in class to remind us we are valued. One of my most vivid memories of my childhood ❤
Ya too bad Christina dances on stage now for kids with a giant green strap on.
Still needed ❤
BEAUTIFUL portrayal of the message we all need to hear and remember!! We all need to drop our phones, drop society’s unrealistic beauty standards, and get back to our true purpose!! Thank you so much for reminding us of this important reality!
Arrasou 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
now I want tlc to rerelease unpretty
forever homegirl 💜
🔥🥵
Chorei.
This song is great. Live and let live. Rock on, Christina.
❤❤❤❤
I'm a Brazilian girl and here we have so many pressions about our bodies, it's so hard, but this song helped me a lot, so many times!   When I had 7 years I heard this song and saw the video for the first time, It was  remarcable for me, because I loved all the Aguilera's style and how the music and her PERFECT voice sounded in my ear hahaha. Today I cried remember my childhood listening Beautiful over and over and over... 20 years has passed and this song still more than beautiful, it's necessary!!!! Thanks for that, Christina!
but she went under the plastic surgery, doesnt she?
This is kinda ironic with her obsession of getting cosmetic surgeries
Damn, I wish I could have had that change to being just a kid... it would have been absolutely life changing. Beautiful video - damn. ❤️
Nup ... lost all respect for you Christina when you pranced about wearing a bedazzled strap on dildo at a concert. That shit belongs in pornos....not a concert..  Just filth.
Absolutely loved this song when it came out and thank you for the updated video to deal with what os going on now!
Shout out to 4 Non Blonde lead singer Linda Perry for writing this masterpiece song. 😢👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤
This made be bawl. Thanks for trying to protect the children.
po fui ver pq tava sem nada pra fazer e choreikkkk
The video uses people who are conventionally attractive
kinda ironic how christina went through botox and plastic surgery too
2022 and Still cry when play this song
Really good video. Thanks to use your voice to try to make people more aware of what we’re doing wrong and the harm of social media
Que clipe mais incrível!! Em pleno 2022 essa canção se encaixou perfeitamente. Me fez chorar ♥️ Ahhhh e essa voz magnífica… Amo 🥰
This hits harder than those plates that my mom used to hit me.
That was Beautiful.
solo pienso en damien de chicas pesadas cantando y recibiendo un zapataso en la cara cx
Thank you for this. This song has always meant so much to so many people, and this new modern video really pinpoints a lot of the modern issues, things that still need to be addressed as we develop as a society. Thank you to the artist herself and to her wonderful team, and whoever suggested that there should be a new take on a classic song for a developing audience.
♥
Esta fracasada deberia de retirarse de la musica🤢🤢
😍♥
Ill never understand why a song with a positive message sounds so sad. It's like shes trying to make you be positive but also wanting you to cry at the same time.
That moment when you realize our generation is so weak. People were stronger mentally and physically before.
today the problem is bigger than ever .....
Ya era bastante grande cuando oi a esta, ya mujer hoy, cantando genio atrapado, y siendo gay en aquel momento, me sentia atrapado en la necesidad de mostrarme, de quererme  sin miedo al que diran...ella logro no solo destapar mis miedos, sino también mi falta de amor, ella con sus letras, su forma de mostrar su interior me hizo ser parte de esta chica que mostrandsose con fuerzas y debilidades me ha y me sigue impactando cada vez que oigo lo nuevo y viejo de ella...Hoy esta canción con el mismo sentir, pero ahora al niñ@ que fuimos y a los niñ@s que hoy son este himno sea el reflejo de pertenencia y de amor a lo que son y no a lo que deberían ser, vivan el día a día, disfruten de ser esos niños que el tiempo de a poco les sacara todo esa bondad, inocencia y bruillo que hoy tiene, mientras sean simplemente NIÑ@S
What a perfect song ✌️ bring back around. 🥰
❤️
Obrigada.
Sooo related with reality
Absolutely wonderful!
Now every artist wants to copy Taylor Swift with the Taylor’s Versions
Talk about things that age really well
Thank you. Great song, great voice, and great video. So heart touching. We need much more compassion and love in this world. ❤️❤️❤️
. seen no pain..
anyone else immediately start weeping when you heard her voice come in? oof
This song got me through such a rough patch when I was younger during its release. I continued to take it along with me, and in turn it helped heal my heart. When the wounds would open up again in my younger adult years it was there for me as well. And now then I’m older and going through work, life, and mental stresses, it’s a warm reminder that nothing can bring me down because no matter where I go, the sun will always shine. 🧡
this is so beautiful
Now i wanna HURT to be drop on 2022 version.
Hermosa canción actualizada a la.realidad
man, i love this woman, this is so needed, I don think i see kids play like that anymore in this generation,please don sit your kids infront of a phone
I really needed this, thanks
Já chorei tanto ouvindo essa música desde o início da adolescência, e agora, casada, continuo a chorar. Essa música traz muitos sentimentos.  🇧🇷
TLC did it better
Yo be honest… I love this song so so much. The idea the video wanted to give is so strong… But the execution is… not it. Sorry, the vibe juste seems of, we don’t get the real point, to much morals exposed to quickly with no finesse et such a too collourfull and perfect « other side » with such a too dark ending. The video just made me really uncomfortable, but not in the way it should.
Where's Christina??
Por esta canción no me suicidé... Amo cada palabra de esta canción.
I've heard this song when i was sitting in junior high school. I even bought the album. And i was really amaze with all the song . nothing failed for me. All the song in striped album such a masterpiece. Thank you xtina for accompany me  grow up. And this song still relateable in this era.
I know this song since I was ten years old, but at 17 I really understood the message and paid attention to the lyrics... I cried like never before and since then. Opened a door in my mind the never will be closed. Linda Perry, I love you! I always think If I was a singer, you would be my number #1 producer, collaborator and songwritter (years after "Whats Up" had the same effect, and you became my fav)
Esta canción  fue un hermoso y poderoso regalo para nosotros…. Que seas un hermoso y mucho más poderoso regalo para la nueva generación…. ❤
Thank you. THANK YOU
I think it was cute how children were playing outside. And I understand the vide is inspired by the message at the end BUT I still found this disturbing and sexualizing children.  Yes, a change is needed - take the damn iPhone away from your child! If you need to contact them then give them a flip phone. 99% of the time a smartphone is used for entertainment and not to talk with parents
Strong, Christina and so necessary.
Thank you.
Rainha atemporal!!!!
Try by Colbie and Pretty Hurts by Beyoncé are so much better. Btw it is a copy 😅
this song is and always be legendary
2022 and it hurts harder than it used to when it came out 20 years ago... THANK YOU FOR MAKING IT VISIBLE FOR OTHER PEOPLE
Kpop need this
Essa é uma das canções mais poderosas do mundo
That really touched me was so disappointed with the social media platforms and with what they do with out mental health and the negative thoughts they bring to our brains 🧠
Mano que clipe necessário¡!!!!!!!!
Its so sad that this is really happening right now 😢😢😢😢
Is this new record?
Arrepiado dos pés a alma ❤️🤍
Why repeat a version again this year? your voice has potential for new songs
Don't you bring me down today!!!
Stunning 😭❤️ this came out the year I hated myself so much I tried to starve myself to death. I wish no one had to feel that again.
Isn't it ironic that right after this video ended I got an ad for Laser Away anti aging
I’d LOVE for her and GaGa to remake this song.🥰
Beautiful video and massage to pass down to this newer generation.
Sono cresciuto con questa canzone durante la mia adolescenza 💕 ora passo il Timone alle nuove generazioni. Augurando di non fissarsi con la perfezione ma accettandosi come siamo. Nei limiti della saluta fisica e mentale ovviamente 👍
What a stranger thumbnail to choose…I don’t think this was very good 🤷🏻‍♀️
💜
🥰🥰
This was probably one the first Xtina's songs I've ever heard
damn
Thank you, Christina. Let the children be children. They have their whole lives to figure out who they want to be. Innocence is so short lived. ❤
❤️😍
Is it said that Christina herself isn't in the video, I know she has gotten work done on her face but I still wish she would have been in it
There's always hope for the future! Love the old video and the new.
Christina, from Mother to Mother, thank you, seriously a huge well done 🙏 x
OMG MY ICONIC
I can't believe I am that old
Nostalgia..
Esta canción siempre ha sido una maravilla ✨
I was the same age as those kids when I first heard this song in 2002, singing at the top of my lungs with my mom in the car. Now I'm 26 and realizing that the kids are following *US* now. Truly just about in tears right now.
😍😍😍😍😍🤩🤩 tá muito lindo o clip
Mean girl vibes
I loved seeing all the kids playing and climbing the trees in normal, kids clothes being free. So beautiful!
Generally speaking, this whole stuff seems so fake after all the fillers and plastic surgeries Christina did to herself. Not talking about her specifically but the whole biz. If you are beautiful no matter what they say and if you are beautiful the way you are, in every single way, then WHY? lol a big question. The song is iconic though, practice what you preech or don't at all.
Thank you so much for speaking up on children and social media/ phones in general. We do not know the long term affects of social media and screen time at a young age. This is such a new thing to humans…It really makes you wonder when we will figure out these phones how we currently use them, are doing more harm then good for society. We need to change. Getting off now 😅
I Love this song ❤️❤️❤️❤️
they should have broken their phones
Melhor música do mundo 😍
PERFEIÇÃO ❤️
Cuantos recuerdos, Dios mio
This is art🙌🏻❤️
Old but gold.. . Sigo você desde sempre desde seu primeiro single..sempre será minha rainha
Beautiful and yet so sad
Me siento feo
🌟Having mixed thoughts on this upload. 1st off the song should be a new 2022 recording. It's lazy otherwise. The small children wearing lots of make up may make pedos and creeps watch this or have some men start thinking how hit kids look when they hurry along with adult things. Christina you are trying to imply that we all look beautiful natural but you always pile the makeup on very heavy so it doesn't come off as true. Make up is sexy and looks great. So there was no need to put it down. It would only make sense if you stopped wearing it, looked natural and showed yourself in the music video. Showing a guys stomach transformation completely wasn't groundbreaking since it shows how good he looked. It should have just showed his stomach and him looking at options of surgery, not the finished results. I am a fan of some of your work but this video is very horrible and not coming off sincere at all. Sorry for the review but I hope it helps you for future ideas. I would like to see another try if possible for this. 👍
我不知道你在生活中可能经历过什么，但我想告诉你，这种生活不仅仅是你所看到的，而是远远超出了。因此，我邀请你接受耶稣基督进入你的生命，相信他在十字架上为你的罪而死，并在心里承认他是你的主和救世主，那么你所有的负担都将消失，你将获得真正的幸福，使你获得永恒的生命，在那里死亡/恐惧等不会休息。❤祝福你! https://youtu.be/XZPlsae5B8c
あなたが今までにどんな経験をしてきたかわかりませんが、この人生は目に見えるものだけでなく、それをはるかに超えるものであることを伝えたいと思うのです。そうすれば、あなたの重荷はすべて消え去り、死や恐れなどのない永遠の命につながる真の幸福にアクセスすることができるのです。❤祝福を! https://youtu.be/CWyfIRjUlZM
No sé lo que habréis tenido/sido en vuestras vidas, pero quiero deciros que no sólo lo parece, sino que va mucho más allá. Por eso, os invito a todos a aceptar a Jesucristo en vuestra vida creyendo que murió por vosotros en la cruz y confesando en vuestro corazón que es vuestro señor y salvador, entonces todas vuestras cargas desaparecerán y tendréis acceso a la verdadera felicidad que os llevará a una vida eterna. El donde la muerte/el miedo, etc., no descansa. ❤️ https://youtu.be/OfZRqfWs1lg
I don't know what you may have had/been through in your lives, but I want to tell you that it doesn't just look like it, but it goes far beyond. So, I invite you all to accept Jesus Christ in your life by believing that he died for you on the cross and confessing in your heart that he is your lord and savior, then all your burdens will disappear and you will have access to true happiness that will lead you to an eternal life. The where death/fear etc does not rest. ❤️ https://youtu.be/XIb_dCIxzr0
Je ne sais pas ce que vous avez pu avoir/endurer dans vos vies, mais je tiens à vous dire que ce dernier ne se l'imite pas à ce qu'on aperçoit, mais elle va bien au-delà. Alors, je vous invite tous à accepter Jésus-Christ dans votre vie en croyant qu'il est mort pour vous sur la croix et en confessant dans votre cœur qu'il est votre seigneur et sauveur, alors tous vos fardeaux vont disparaitre et vous accéderait au vrai bonheur qui vous mènera à une vie éternelle. La ou la mort/peur etc ne repose pas. ❤️ https://youtu.be/O-Za0jggT8Q https://youtu.be/qWHRq5RN4Xw
Mentira que ela fez isso!!!! EU TE AMOOOOO
Little me needed this video. Thank you for teaching us over the years that we matter. I love you Xtina❤
I grew up in the sixties and seventies and trust me most young ladies wanted to become either an airline stewardess or a model and once a model the goal was to become an international model. To become one of the two there was strict rules, such as how tall and how much they could weigh. The young ladies had to be single and have no children! Both professions required the young ladies to be at least five foot six or better and be super skinny. The average weight for a young lady that was five foot six was around one hundred and five or less. To stay super skinny many in both professions would make themselves throw up after eating. Most were taking diet pills along with stringent exercise routines. The young ladies had to be beautiful in order to be accepted as a steward or model. Most teenagers in high school wanted to look like their favorite model which meant being on a strict diet along with a nearly impossible exercise routine. Young ladies like me were below the height requirement and were naturally skinny, were never looked at by talent scouts looking for new models. As for the airline stewardess the minute the young lady filled out the application of which demanded to know how tall they were and how much they weighed would be automatically disqualified.  Not much has changed except now the plus size girls have a chance to become top models. It is very sad that young girls are targeted and told that in order to be truly beautiful they must be super skinny. I wish that young girl would be told that beauty comes from within and not from being what others wants them to be!
Hermoso mensaje! ❤
Please stream sneakers by itzy we need to hurry up and st34m faster and nonstop
❤❤❤❤❤
wow! the video is amazing even more than the first video of this song was, it's incredible how this song can move the roots year after year, they should release a new version every so often.
This is a piece of art that covers me in tears as well as which gives me hope that new generations will find the means to impede social media site influencers from preying upon them. Huge kudos to Christina Aguilera as well as to those who are working on enlightening children, teens, and young adults towards saying no to becoming enablers of harmful influencers/marketers. 🌻
💔🥹
BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!! YESSSSSSSSSS
Thank you for this song, as always and this new, powerful video!
Love the male inclusion in this :)
мега крутой посыл у клипа...
小さい窓から良い部分だけ切り取り見えやすくなってしまった分、人と簡単に比べてしまう世の中になり今の若い人達は生きづらくなっているのを感じてました。人は表面的な美で評価されがちですが、内なる美しさに目を向けて自分のことを好きと思える若者が少しでも増えますように。
Chills! Thank you for this beautiful masterpiece - the song and this timely video. Words can't being me down ❤️‍🔥🙏🌹🦁☀️🕊️
I was 11 when this song came out. After watching the 2022 visual and seeing the children play and ACTUALLY behave as children near the end brings back such a nostalgic feeling. Pure bliss ❤
Christina needs someone to sing this song to her
Thank you
this is how social media control us. We are uniquely beautiful on our own💖💅
This hit me the same way it did in 2002
❤
I think the irony is, Christina herself had plastic surgery 😪
20 years later this song still make me cry too much …. Don’t let them down ❤
I wanted to seee Christina haha 😊
I'm crying! Its So sad and so beautiful!
Cuanta verdad!!
Magnificent thx Xtina we all love u ❤
Just as powerful today and it was went at its release. Thank you! 😢
My dad use to sing this song to me when I was a kid and would cry every time we would hear it on the radio. it definitely helped me see things differently and I appreciate my dad for that. I love you Dad. <3
Can anyone please interprete the guy with the razor for me? What's his story?  Also, this song is so timeless 🤌
Oh may heart ❤️ thank you Christina Aguilera. This what 2022 and our future needs.
Beautiful ❤️  Thank you for the powerful and much needed message. Well done 👏🏻
Love!
i wish i could go back in time and do everything in my power to make baby patrick not take social media so seriously. that shit changed me so much that i completely lost myself and i dont even know if i can go back to how i was before
И при этом сама с пластикой и кучей facetune :/
I'm remembering Mercedez when she covering this song for Glee 💕
Stripped cambio mi vida y desde ahí TE AMO Y SOY TU FAN TU ARTE ES INSPIRACIÓN, no importa cuántos años pasen siempre serás la REINA para mi ❤️🥺
thank you thank you so much for this
Immediately crying.
BEAUTIFUL 😊
i rem the days i was young and naive. BLISS, playing outside with no gadgets
Coming from a singer who doesn’t know how to age gracefully is kinda hypocritical
beautiful. i loved this song as a kid and i cried , and i still love it now. Its a song we all need to hear, self love is hard. The video was great showing what our children today are going through. Our kids need to be happy and just live your life as kids. life is beautiful :)
Nothing beats the original.
very informative MTV
Pretty
I LIKE & LOVE THIS SONG EVERSINCE 😍😍😍
i love this woman.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
A Mv with strong messages
What I got was let kids be kids . Brought tears to my eyes 😢
I salute you for this amazing, artistic, and wonderful video addressing a universal truth and shedding light on such an important issue! <3
True… It is fault of mobile devices and internet…
https://youtu.be/7kEwGXLdbZ8❤
Un himno que nunca pasará de moda. Me encantó la reversión del vídeo adaptándose al contexto actual de los adolescentes. El mensaje final es TODO. SOS única Christina!❤️
I cried in 2002 hating my body and all my insecurities. Now we have 2022 and I’m crying for beeing grateful for my body that is healthy and full of life 🙏🏼 this song helped me through a lot! Thank you for that ♥️
I love it, this song helped me a lot when I was in the deepest part of the depression, I was 15-16, I was feeling bad and I wanted to hurt myself, but listening this son made me happy, and now I'm 34 and I steel feel the good vibe, thank you a lot
CRYING AHGG timeless art with such a strong message.
We Love You CA
atemporal
So beautiful
Después de 20 años !! Está hermosa canción nuevamente me hizo llorar 🥺 , yo ahora 2022 con tres hijas mujeres, llendo a enseñarles el vídeo para que compartan conmigo lo que yo veía a los casi 16 años , el tiempo pasa muy rápido 🍀 Siempre serás grande Cristina ❣️
And still the actors themselves are beautiful according to the model of beauty. It's a shame that there isn't a real and representative variety
It's interesting how this music video shows children... because beauty standards are affecting younger and younger generations
I like it, the only thing it's missing is Damian from mean girls.
I love you. Thank you.
This song is TIMELESS. ❤️
This is such a powerful message, such a great song!! I´m glad you can share it with the world again.
❤
This is a lovely message, but in my experience, most physically fit people in the gym are incredibly positive to be around and are always happy to see a person with a difficult journey ahead of them come in and try. It is a shame to shun those who work hard on their health and fitness when it can be such a force of positivity for young people.
Powerful message and imagery. Relevant then, needed now.
lowkey looks like a PSA vid
I can't help but cry! Thank you, Christina!
LOONA 🤝 Xtina  making empowering music 💖💖
If you’ll notice, it’s all kids. With phones and social media in their hands.   Stop giving your children access to all this insanity. The kids without phones and social media are the ones without every mental problem under the sun.   Make your kids be bored. Make three use their imaginations again. Make them play again. Take their phones!! This is parents faults. Fight against the social media.
Such a powerful message
Esse ficou maravilhoso! Só q nada supera o original...
Now that Christina is a mom, she understood the assignment 5x more
Does anyone else still picture damian?          " I am beautiful!!!!! in every single way!!!(shoe hits face) YES ! words can't bring me down (pounds chest/ throws shoe back ) 😂😂😂😂 " bring me down todayyyy!" ❤MeanGirls
No puedo creer que esto solo tenga dos millones de views en una semana y la porquería que saco shakira 55millones. Así estamos después lloran por querer un mundo mejor
rigtig god video meget og godt realistisk lavet det rammer hårdt
This song couldn't have come back at a better time in this fucked up life we are consuming. Tears from me too.
Love this song so much 🤗🤗😍😍❤️❤️❤️
Fazia tempo que não chorava assim 😿
20 years have passed and nothing has changed.
<3
Did she actually record the whole song all over or did she just make a new video for it?
😭✨❤️🔥
I have the CD.... Amo mucho ésta canción.... ❤️❤️❤️❤️. Me lloro todo
<3 <3 <3 <3
Still can’t believe this weirdo wore a strap-on on stage at a family friendly event 🙄 She shouldn’t be allowed around children Also if it’s not ok to mutilate children then that should apply for all scenarios  A Tom boy 9 yr old girl isn’t a boy A 9 yr old boy that likes dolls isn’t a woman  And a unborn babie isn’t a clump of cells it’s a human being
Omg, 20 years later listening to this song has brought me to tears 😢 as it did back then, I have always thought of myself as ugly and unattractive in so many ways.  Thank you christina aguilera for re releasing this great song.
We need more then never this song
Esta canción jamás dejará de encajar en esta sociedad tan plástica y superficial… es una joya… te adoro Christina❣️❣️❣️
Remixes aren't my thing but this was was
Lovely❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️
No matter what you're going through in life, you are not alone. You have good friends and families who support you all the way. Stay beautiful the way you are. An great song with a powerful message 20 years later. ❤
Seeing baby girl wake up in grass got me. Just go outside kids. It was so fun. And you really won't ever have that time again. This video should just randomly play when commercials are on.
We love this ! Great way to revamp such a powerful song ❤
Social media is broken. It's not real life.
OMG it is fking genius to release new vids of older timeless hits
What a subversive and evil video
Seem like Christina heard and saw what was happening around us and have to reinforced the message. "I am beautiful no matter what they said" ❤
One day the human race will cease to exist and so will all the horrible things that we've created, forced upon ourselves and others. What a beautiful day that will be.
I love you FOREVER, my love, my Queen, my diva, one Million kisses from Brazil! #cometobrazilxtina #cometobrazil 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷 Brazil love you ❤️❤️❤️
but she has plastic surgeries 🤔😑
and this is why I'm not letting my kids have have smart phones ESPECIALLY social media...theres just no good reason.. as a millennial/gen z cusp I can attest we get enough enough influence from society and media already... I want my kids to feel like their day is their day, instead of living the days of all the ppl they follow or see on tik Tok etc. its so vapid
atemporal né, mores
This is a strong message
This song hits hard 🥺
Wow why did this make me cry wow
and still they choose no ugly kids fot this video...
This used to be my favourite song and I’m ashamed to say I’d forgotten about it for a while… it’s such a BEAUTIFUL song with a wonderful message, I’m glad I have it back again 🥰
The ending is so powerful. THANK YOU Aguilera, for spreading this message.❤️
Still jerking tears from my eyes
Meh
❤️
If you don't give drugs to your children why do you give them a smart phone? Wake up people who give children phones even under 1-2 years while pushing them in buggy, when the child is eating and the parent is just next to him, instead of having a conversation they place the phone in front of them. Shameful behaviour but they don't feel it....why on earth they wanted to have children? Look in each other's eye not on your phones, get connected with your environment and be human, free and be aware that those smart phone zombies are making themselves slaves, no one is  obliging you to check your phone or follow trends and be a sad, shadow of yourself.  Million thanks for this  new  video to this anthem.  With new technologies, should not come new morals.
This video is so well made<3
The most poetic way to tell us all to touch grass 😂 I really do love this though ❤
Is incredible how this song hits even harder now
That's why I stopped following "fitgirls" and influencers who always use a filter (and yes you can tell). I never knew someone close to me with an eating disorder, until now unfortunately...3 friends of my are already diagnosed. World is f*cked up atm.
so deep i cried and murdered my whole family ugh you did it again Christina always changing souls for the better xoxo<3
Mis respetos, una joya audiovisual.
Take that self absorbed Kardashians. Our children deserve better! Thank you Christina. The lies perpetuated by social media needs to be called out and destroyed. This video os in the right direction. Let children and adults be authentic not manufactured!!
❤️
Absolutely love christina especially for this ❤
timeless song ❤️
Absolutely heartbreaking. the world is so insecure it's scary.
fuck the world , let's fall in love in 2022 ❤
someone should make a video like this showing how industries and platforms want to impose gender ideology on children
Cristina lo hizo otra vez jajajaj, lloré al recordar mi niña interior bombardeada de alguna de todas esas cosas.... hoy abrazo esa niña herida en su infancia y feliz en su adultez. Espero que este lindo mensaje llegue a tod@s los que han pasado por algo similar a lo que muestra el video y entiendan que son perfectos tal cual 🥰. Abrazos  a tod@s !!!!
I appreciate that they included men and boys, growing up most of the body image issues were focused on girls only, not undermining what media is doing to young girls since decades, just do not forget about your sons and brothers, some start to take hormones that ruins their health or follow toxic communities like incels.
Basta ya de una sociedad que desde pequeños enseñan que para verte guapo tienes que acudir a quirófanos, llegar a problemas alimenticios, inseguridades y problemas mentales…  las redes sociales están haciendo muchísimo daño  . Increíble mensaje.
This video is so painful to see because it shows the terrible truth. Social media kills people's souls and the most horrible thing is that it kills children. It takes their innocence and purity away. It teaches them many bad things, harms them mentally and emotionally and the society that grows out of it lacks humanity. I work in retail, in cosmetics department. Never in my life I've seen so many childern 9 or 10 years old by themselves buying skin care or make up products. And of course everything that's trending on tiktok. It's scary and it needs to stop.
La canción ya era hermosa pero con este nuevo video nos hace reflexionar mas sobre el futuro de nuestros niños. I love you Christina.
wow powerful
Yes, thank you Christina... but also thank you Linda. ✍️
How beautiful ❤
Get outside kids💚 (and big kids)
2205555 views ❤
Absolutely Beautiful! Almost brought me to tears.  My heart hurts for humanity.  I'm committed  to be an instrument of change
En el vídeo anterior hablaba de otros temas que fueron ya aceptados . Y lo único que habla es de la belleza implantada cuando ella era un estereotipo de la moda . Que cosas no . Romatizacion
one of my favorite songs 😭
Thank you. From then til now and forevermore, thank you.
More stupid shows
Can we poss have a 2022 version of the entire album "Stripped"?!!! X
Love you xtina
Ainda melhor que o primeiro. Parabéns! 👏👏👏🥰
I feel like the social issues presented in the original video are still more than relevant today, but this remake is very touching as well. <3
Given today's instagram filters that give a fake impression of societal perceived "beauty" this song and accompying video really hit hard in a world that has always been biased wen it comes to looks.Christina Aguilera 👏👌
Good idea for the Video and nice Song, but why we see mostly the stereotype people, mostly every one was thin where are the pepole with more weight?  I was a bit fatter than the others as a child and I still am now, and I think almost only thin people were shown. That's a shame and doesn't get the message across as it should
Powerfull, our generation needs to hear this more often!!🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I love how they included the stereotypical body image mem have to go through too! Mem also suffer for being skinny or fat
I’m crying thank you for this message
This is beautiful 😍
Yo me quiero operar los senos así como lo hizo Christina Aguilera 😂
So poignant, God bless our precious children the future.
You're a fking hero ! ❤️
Just so you know everything is happening for a reason and no one should be ashamed of. This is how we are going to get up even though when someone peeks you and said something which is not right. Get up and start a new day. Since nobody gonna bring you down today.  Let us join hands and start a new life again.
Well I'm bubbling. Fantastic song 💚❤️. Probably more apt now then ever.
beautiful
Incredible video. SO powerful, really need to spread this - thakn you to everyone involved
You made me cry in 2002 and now I'm crying in 2022. The only thing that was missing is the over use of filters, facetune, and photoshop. Child the need to always trying to live up to ridiculous expectations is crazy. A wonderful video for what's happening now.
Its sad to see kids nowadays are too impatient to grow up and not being a kid. With certain influencers becoming their role models. Life is short, kids. Enjoy your childhood.
😥
today's children are losing what childhood is, many young people do not accept themselves when everyone is beautiful no matter what. Those are two things we have to take into account for self-improvement
a versão da mercedes de glee>>>
Thank you, Christina! 👩
This new generation needed this song!
THANKS TO LEAD THE WAY FORWARD A NEW ANGLE TO SEE HOW EVERYTHING COULD BE DIFFERENT IF EVERYBODY EACH PERSONNE CHOSE TO CHOSE TO TURN OFF THESES SHEET SOCIAL MÉDIA OR TV BAD NEWS OR MAGASINS SOLDING A INSANE FANTASY
Holy shit.... powerful... and such a sad commentary on how we see each other and how painful it is for literally everyone.
❤
Tem lágrimas nos meus 😢😭 muito bom!
♡♡♡
Daym
This song still fits in 2022. The message is even stronger for people these days who really cant be grateful of their appearance and always want to change how they look like to fit into the society standard. They will always follow the beauty standard that will always change every year. Imagine how many times they will do filler/plastic surgery to fit every beauty standard? Gosh..no wonder everyone will look the same: fake lips, fake nose, fake boobs, fake everything. In the next few years they will see their face will get even worse then their real face
YEEEESSSSS
Thank you, Christina
Both versions makes me so emotional. I did cry and i do cry now.
subtitles for people who do not understand English and audio for people with visual disabilities at minute 4:08
THIS REALLY NEEDS TO CHANGE <3
Se há 20 anos já era difícil se encaixar nos padrões, hoje então é praticamente impossível! Uma mensagem atemporal!
Any of the proceeds from these 2M+ views going towards the organisations mentioned?
Now and then still feels the same.
Just. Wow. The video hits like a freight train. Incredibly well done.
i liek how this appeals to all genders alike and the unrealistic standard for everyone
Wow. This is more powerful than ever. Im crying.
+Love
Thanks for reminding US ALL!!!!
So sad but so true 😫 This is exactly what our society looks like today...People trying to achieve some absurb "beauty" standarts to feel accepted.
Great song but least recorded it again 😅
I botched myself 9 times  (2 Rhinoplasties, Nose alar reduction, paranasal augmentation, buccal fat removal, upper lip reduction, mouth corner twist and hair transplant and fat transfer) during 25-30 yo. because I want to feel sexy, handsome and belong to the world.  After all I reach the goal resulting in a time I look in mirror and feel like. This is not my face, I didn’t look in mirror for along time before self-acceptance.  I do look better but inside it is never really change and Most of things still go the same.  I am assurance u that what yours is the best, trust me.
Merci Christina Aguilera … , une pensée en même temps au TLC avec unpretty 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Bela critica . E o celular saindo sangue no final...
Sensacional
This made cry before and still today ❤️
Lindo! 🥲💗
Gracias en ese entonces y gracias ahora.. ya siendo adulto esta canción me pega distinto y , a la vez, igual que cuando era un niño .
Beautiful 😍😍😍
CHOREI!
You are true light worker ❤ thank you for this powerful message sis🧘🏻‍♀️💕
love this video but it seems odd that the person making the message literally does this themselves by altering her image with botox, fillers and plastic surgery.... hypocrisy
This video killed me then resurrected me a second after, wow
I cried when I was 15 and heard this song because it hit me right where I was.  Now this video has me bawling because I have my own babies and especially my 12 year olds I try and protect from these issue but middle school is so hard on them.  😢
I just listened to the original like two or three weeks ago and thought how it would resonate with so many young kids today! We thought shit was superficial and crazy when we were younger but its nothing like this generation of self conscious issues
👏 👏 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 SO PROUD OF CHRISTINA FOR MAKING THIS AGAIN !! I AM SO PROUD OF MY NATURAL SELF I AM ORGANICALLY ME AS GOD MADE ✊❤
Volví a llorar como con la primera versión, se que en algún momento voy a aceptar todo de mi
Social hurt.
Thank you christina 💙
Can’t wait for an out of context 15 sec part of this song to go viral on tiktok
Omg this was my childhood. I'm crying.
I love your song... But, as an artist, you are the first to promote make up... Sorry... But thank you to try to send a message, but its kind of hard to reverse this... but thanks for the intention to try to reverse something that yourself you put on you... Maybe begin to stop putting make up on you could help the situation more and more to be consequent with your message?
🤍🤍🤍🤍
👏👏👏
This song is still as beautiful as ever. But did anyone else find the video cringe? Like the equivalent of killing the dog in a movie just to get a reaction?
the first video is when i was a child.. felt so emotional now that that im adult 20 years later it’s still hits..
ojala que causara mayor impacto porque seguimos en el mismo circulo de destrucción que antes, las redes sociales tienen mucho que ver con esto.
Even though I greatly appreciate this message from Christina, I do think actions speak louder than words. I hope Christina can start being a living example and stop using botox, fillers etc. and grow older naturally. You are an example for all of us who were ninetees kids, now in our thirties and forties and it would be such a relief to see a celebrity accept & appreciate the consequences of aging instead of trying to hold on to a forced image of beauty and youth. I hope Christina can find the strength and courage herself to accept her natural appearance. Actions speak even louder than words. (And I truly do appreciate the words in this song, I do).
I remember my mum banning screens and forcing us outside to play unless it was raining ... thankful to have a childhood like that now .  That was the 90s and yes times change but the concept remains the same . The world rots our brains with social media and zombifies us creating a dystopian future for generations to come . It’s rarther worrying that people care about sculpting an unrealistic body , what the world thinks , likes and follows ...actually gets very poisonous ( I’ve been sucked into it before and I started pushing myself to be something I wasn’t )  I focused on a talent , a favourite interest and creative ways to express myself and limit myself to maybe 10 mins a day on my phone ... I’m far happier for it
Hello Nim, accept my friend request please  Thank you
A mis 30 años comprendo esta canción 💜
Nothing new. This song made me cry even harder. This is so important. Thank you.
After 20years re release this song, just now I felt the sincerity and the meaning and message of this song and I really felt within me. Thank u for this such a wonderful song ❤❤
Schönheit ist nicht immer außen.Die wahre Schönheit kommt von ihnen und ist die Seele
Its so perfect ❤
=(
역시 명작은 영원하다 언니가 내 어린시절을 함께 해줘 얼마나 고마운지 몰라요❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
20 years later and this song is even more powerful than when it was 1st released. This video clip hits hard and just shows how much technology and social media has changed our society. I felt it and couldn't help the tears from flowing down my face 💔❤️‍🔥💘💖❤️‍🩹
❤️❤️
Holy shit this is a strong message for sure. I knew back than but like wow. And still beautiful voice Christina as well
The kids playing in the tree is such a beautiful sight. I see little girls who are 12 going on 25. So sad…. : (
I love the song and I think the message is so important. Unpopular opinion: Unfortunately there are almost no more kids who just want to play. The kids nowadays grow up with parents addicted to their phones. Why would their kids be any different 🤷‍♀️ sad but true.
Do you think she re-recorded this a la Taylor Swift?
Dang. Relevance.
😢❤
Wow. Really connected with this.
This is a piece of art <3
A big slap to recent britney controversy to christina hahaha
this song is legend
The plastic element is ironic given all the stuff done to her own face. Beautiful song though.
I’m not crying…. You are!  🥹❤️
I'm beautiful !
This song is just amazing no fk wat that this song already 20 years old ! Just like me crazy
Still so powerful 😢
I didn’t expect myself to cry😭
More relevant than ever in this social media generation
I really love this song, this was so necessary… it was so helping 20 years ago, and I think is much more necessary in this time… thank you Xtina! ❤
If kids these days had songs like this to listen to they won't be undergoing plastic surgeries at the rate they are doing now. Parents these days telling their kids they are non-binary and trans and giving them puberty blockers and hormones and mutilating their genitalia.
Old version is better. Song is amazing. You are beautiful ❤
Goosebumps
Sigue siendo un poderoso mensaje
我想到蔡依林的那首怪美的～
This is crazy!!  A legendary song
GOD the amount of times I watched the original MV on yahoo music and cried.. Now 20 years later I'm crying because of this one.
next voice within please. these are ones of the songs i listened when i was in my adolescense. they soothed my pain when I felt so undeserving or isolated.
The world will always need this song
next voice within please. these are ones of the songs i listened when i was in my adolescense.
ladies and gentleman, this is video!! much needed for this days sadly
Its so ironic to hire child actors to portray exploitation of children
Obesity is unhealthy, so eat less and do exercise
"Let the kids be kids"
I didn t understand about the guy with razor and pills, what S about?
Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed  I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today  To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?  You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today  No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes  And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side  'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
Господи я этого дождалась😍😭❤️‍🩹
You made me cry.....darn bro...
This couldn’t be a better time to release such a masterpiece. ❤
wow
thank you for this masterpiece. the classic song paired with the video's message of how social media is influencing how kids and teens view themselves is definitely a game-changer. well done!
Yeah nice video.  However, I just checked Christina’s IG and her pics are clearly edited & she’s definitely had work done when you compare her 2000 self to now. Not at all hating, in this day and age everyone wants something doing and I don’t blame them, I would if I had money, and I probably definitely would if I was in the public eye a lot. But I’m tired of entertainers projecting one message but not living to that standard IRL. These entertainers have money to do anything they want to feel better about themselves.  I love the vid and appreciate the message but it just doesn’t make much difference if the person behind it doesn’t  match up. Just my opinion.
Yeah no.... Preferred the first one, a masterpiece. Cause she's fat now she doesn't appear in the video which is contradictory because she should've appear fat and naked now singing beautiful. This tells you people that were live in a hypocrite society 😌
❤
Much Needed song regardless of any generation any country or culture.
Lagu galau ketika SD, selalu request di radio. Time flies, miss that moments
no habia fexs para el video??????? pregunto
beautiful letra  Don't look at me Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is? You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side 'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
Brutal mensaje visual, excelente para que lo vean las nuevas generaciones, y uno que otro viejito con síndrome de juventud no me dejes!!!
Please blow up Ecuador 🙏🏽 💣
So fuckin powerfull, still. Even more ❤️
22 years later  an this song is needed more than ever ! My anthem.
The reality of today's generation  😔😔😔
People in 2022 needs this song. I mean the meaning of this song.
I struggle with facial dysmorphia and this gave me chills. Especially the shots of kids with marker on their faces. Damn. So sad this is still an issue for people today.
❤❤❤❤❤
oh my...
las 2 versiones me hicieron llorar :'), han pasado 20 años y no hemos cambiado al contrario hemos empeorado se necesitan mas personas reales y desintoxicarnos de las redes y la "perfección", los niños deberían ser niños
YEEEESS!!!!!!!!!! <3
2:07 this hit so hard. You can see the stress the adult is under from the scrutiny, and it goes to show that even though the children are absorbing this and storing it away, the adults are suffering as well
I am sure none of the children chosen in this video was ever bullied because of their looks. If you really want to make a video that talks about internal beauty then chose people who have gone through the worst because of their looks, not attractive people.  This video is cheap.
Pesado, cruel e real!
Well done Christina!wonderful message! <3
y el anuncio que me sale justo antes del video es de adelgazar y bajar de peso, el mundo si que es una mierda definitivamente 🤮
I cried in the first time i listened this song. Many years after that I cry again each time I hear it. It's so emotiving and shake all my feelings. This new video is amazing.
I needed this ❤
This is very helpful. Thank you. 😔
This hits different
My favorite song when I was on 5th grade.
😎😎
The original video hits much harder because each character has a story I'm able to follow
擦妈特意赶在得意学徒胡叶新复出的时候重发这首歌
So hard to watch this without crying my eyes out. It's a good cry though 😭😭😭
This need to change.
Children idolize adults, and yet the adults in our culture are deeply wounded children who haven't put in the work to heal and mature. They look like big, beautiful specimens on the outside but inside is a wounded child. It's time to grow up and heal that baby inside you that doesn't feel worthy. You are worthy simply because you exist.
God bless you Christina ....this is what children of today need to see
hope to stop body shamming and name calling 😢
Très juste cette mise à jour ❤️
❤❤❤ we need more from you ❤❤❤
Très beau message  mais malheureusement la chanteuse n'en est pas un exemple lol c'est risible ... Elle est hyperlooké, elle joue beaucoup sur son look son physique,ca ne correspond en rien  à l'image qu'elle veut véhiculé dans ce clip. Celui en 2002, était plus cohérent et en adéquation.  Aguilera est elle même sur les réseaux sociaux.
everytime this song comes on, tears starts forming in my eyes :( a timeless and impactful song, thank you Christina.
I was just thinking about this song.. this is so timely
No le gana al vídeo original.
Muy bien por Christina!! Great message.
The most powerful song from all time
this song never gets old, and the first video still fits our society. I hope this new videos will send a powerfull message to the Gen Z, I am 26 (so Millennials/Gen z) and I already see younger people suffering for such a high social pressure.
Sorry but 2002  said waaaayy more than 2020  2002:  Homosexualism, Dark life style, Bulimia, eating disorder, School Bullying 2022:  Body image issue that's it!   Beautiful lyrics covers a lot of issues should have been focused in that way.   Now, the video has a good message of course, but do you know how solve the issue with the mobile and social network?  Easy, avoiding the kids to get tablets and phones so early,  how can be possible you parents allow your kid to get a tablet or phone at 6, 8 years old when they have not criteria to make difference between what's good and what's bad?   Be a good parent and don't throw your kids to technology just to get rid of them.
Is that Kim Kardashian’s voice in the beginning, because I’m all for it. That entire family is extremely toxic to young people’s mental health.
A Benetton commercial
Necessary❤
Still hits hard, this song got me through so much. Thanks Christina for this song, it's so beautiful and hits home with many of us, offering comfort in hard times. Always be in my top favourite songs of all time.
why isnt ugly also seen as beautiful? why is ugly a bad thing? why isnt beautiful a bad thing? why should it matter? who cares if youre ugly or beautiful? youre you. regardless of description. whatever.
This song is powerful! Definitely got me thru it when I was younger! 21 & still singing it !! ❤
I am crying… this was so needed
Thank you Christina for this video, I literally crying. I hope this will video can be an awakening call for the teens in this time and that they can realize how social media damaging and ruining their life.   20 years has been passed and yet this song remain so strong in our life and even more today! Thank you Christina for your beautiful voice, song, and beautiful message you have shared to the world <3
Thank you for making this for us! My  generation n myself need this deeply
Chorei no primeiro, e chorei agora de novo... OBRIGADO
This song brings so much childhood memories.
This is so indeed Real especially this Generation but no matter what they say we're beautiful, were unique so don't pity on yourselves,  it is very important of being you.
This music and videoclip helped me so much in my adolescence. And I hope so much this helps much more people now in 2022. Iconic and necessary! <3 Music of my life. Thank you Xtina for this anthem
So glad this wasn’t a “Woke” version of this song. Stayed to its original meaning and everything. Still a beautiful song till this day.
This is why I miss the time prior to social media popularity. People back then were simple, natural and less self-conscious. Nowadays, many can't leave the house without full on heavy makeup and/or have gone through plastic surgery multiple times. It's easier now to constantly compare ourselves and our lives to others thanks to social media.
This song saved my life, and I hope it continues to save lives. A forward masterpiece which is timeless.
aww my fav songs and hope this songs that changing into the teen's mental health including young adults too 🥰💝💖
Love this….  People care so much about what people say, think or fitting an image that they overlook how beautiful they really are
I remember when I first heard this song. My boyfriend ( at the time) and I were driving through France and it came on the radio of our little hire car. We were blown away!  I loved it ever since!  I miss the absence of social media from back in those days!
So so soooo true!
What a beautiful video, oh my god. I have goosebumps and tears in my eyes. Remember that whatever you do, you do it only for yourself. All those celebs have had cosmetic surgeries and treatments and they still use photoshop and filters! They will never be happy, because happiness comes from within.
My god, makes me so sad looking at this video because it’s so sad where we have gone as a society, I’m obvi guilty of it, texting and being on our phones all day, but my god I’m 28 I at least enjoyed my childhood away from phone, I feel so bad for the next generation right now and the future. 😢 please love yourself kids and explore the world, scrape your knee at the park, get grass marks on ur elbows. Just be outside and put the phones and iPads in the garabage. Please
Christina Aguilera Philippines is having a gathering on 5th November. Who wants to join and celebrate 20th year of Stripped?
그래 우리 모두는 그 자체로 아름다운 본질적인 존재라는 것… 결코 잊어서는 안되고 그 무엇보다 선행되어야하는 이야기… 여전히 울림이 큰 노래
People in Korean must watch this
Muy bien Christina!!! Se tenía que decir (otra vez) en el contexto actual de las redes sociales. Yo soy médico de familia trabajando en salud mental, y es un problema actual de gran relevancia. La canción y el video, me llegó al corazón. Hagamos difusión!!!
Wow this is powerful ❤ and so sad 😞 one of the hardest things I felt with during childhood, even now. Something I think everyone of us struggles with. Even the ppl we think are perfect probably struggle as well.
I love it ❤
<3
yes, this is sadly still relevant today
GRACIAS
Reminds me of tlc- unpretty
😭😭😭
I'm not ugly judgemental society is. People who called you ugly they are ugly not You, You are beautiful 😍. We are all beautiful, nobody is ugly we are all living in a judgemental society. I'm beautiful 😍❤️ in every single way 💗. These words can't bring me down.   Love you Christina Aguilera 💖💖💖. You are so beautiful and talented. Live long life gorgeous 🤩.
So powerful and much needed message 😢
This is very sad but true even to today
...I still prefer the one mv from 2003
After so many years, I found a music video with an extremely impactful and meaningful message. Because these days, I can’t relate and understand the meaning of half of the music videos produced. ❤
I’m ashamed of what has become of society. I remember growing up kids weren’t worried about what they looked like or who’s posting what on Tiktok or Instagram or Facebook, because it didn’t exist! Look what social media has done to our kids… People only portray themselves how they want to be seen! None of it is real!!
*uses conventionally attractive, ablebodied kids* Still dont see any who look like me
You are beautiful 😘
Que mensagem profunda e necessária
I would only say, please parents / guardians / caregivers, please block social media from your youth/kids devices, there are many technology ways to do so. Yes, they may see it from their friends, at school and other places but at least your doing your part to protect them, obviously we are not there 100% of the time. Please be active in checking their devices even if they get mad at you for doing, even if you feel they know what they are doing because guess what, no they don't their minds are still growing and learning. And lastly please talk to them in a daily basis, it can be over a call or over a text of face to face. 😂 I have done all 3 with my own children and they are all teenager age but eventually they do get the message that we are here for them and will always be here for them. ❤ You are beautiful!!!
Cute concepts, but not reality in 2022
let kids be kids ban mobiles and social media for under 18s simple
What a great idea to release this. Beauty standards have gotten even worse.
SOBBING! I am so glad a new generation will get to know this song and it's beautiful message
Thing song came to me at such a right time ..
What an ironic 😢
❤‍🔥
i cried so much. i hate myself and im trying to love myself. im 28 but i feel the same way as those teenage girls and boys.
I am speechless. and crying like a baby This message IS SO IMPORTANT and every single person living in this generation needs to watch this video. It's is so precisely executed and just hits different. Thank you Christina for speaking up FOR CHANGE.
🙌
Loved that this was re-released. What a great idea! ❤
Que lindo! Que perfeita atualização
we need song more more like this
this song will forever be immortal and relevant
We needed this
Par contre Christina ne s'est pas appliqué à elle-même ce qu'elle dénonce dans le clip comme la chirurgie par exemple, qu'il l'a complètement défiguré...⚠️⚠️⚠️
no one needed this though 😭🤣
No way it’s been 20 years since this song came out!!
incrível
Why kids in this vid mostly? I think we are all kids inside as grown up and what had shaped up was a stupid society standards that is boggus and instated by higher ups who only want power and to make money over people had been insecure and influenced by others. So no matter what they say.. no matter what they do.. don't let them bring you down todayyyyyyy. 🎶 🎵.. be you and only... you 💕
20 anos arrepiando o povo com essa introdução babadeira. te amo, Christina. obrigado! ❤
I am so glad this ended this way! Love, love, love this!
Don't look at me Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is? You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side 'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
I still feel as that child. What happens when your are a kid mark us forever. Thanks for being there, and for being now. Love from Argentina 🇦🇷
Omg this is so beautiful! ❤️❤️
LYRIC  Don't look at me  Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?

OH WOW
Incredible!
I'm so thankful I grew up in a time before social media 🙏
Kinda funny considering all the work CA has done to her own body 8)
Omg I'm crying
😪😪
So powerful. The message, the video, the voice and the Christina Aguilera👏🙌
！
Social media algorithm (facebook, instagram, youtube, tiktok) is designed to make viewers as addicted as possible, blame Mark Zuckerberg
Songs like this one should be more popular instead of sexual-explicit-songs
This song is Timeless, it applies across all generations!
20years later and still make me cry..wow!!
I hope they put caption on in various languages to make a stronger impact n got the message acrossed
Love you Christina!
seems like the 90s and 2000s artists.. those major ones are rejuvenated. Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson and of course the only one Christina!
This is so good and so depressing at the same time. But we love the message. Respect to the ones who came up with the Video idea
seems like the 90s and 2000s artists.. those major ones are rejuvenated.
This video was Beautiful 👍 thank you!
This song got me through being outcasted by girls because i wasn't pretty enough and this song got me through that. Thanks Christina and Linda ❤️
Thank you Christina. A video so meaningful and important to realize what we’ve done. Hopefully the next version in 20 years will look different.
I STILL CRY HEARING THIS SONG! LUV YA XTINA! 😭😭😭😭
90s kids were the last generations of kids who had the happiest childhood before internet and gadgets became a trend. Those memories of playing in the playground in the morning and at sunset, playing hide and seek, playing who is the fastest to climb the trees, playing in the river who get the longest minutes underwater … etc… I am glad I belong to the 90s kids.
World needed it so bad today.. thank you for re-releasing it
I love you Christina Aguilera.
ths is the sad realtyNOW.
amazing video, describes a lot about these days and the effects of social media. I hope the right people get affected and inspired.  Love it and thank you Christinaa <3
semplicemente perfetto 💛
This song is more relatable than ever.  I have been having scars because of eczema that appears from my scalp to the sole of my foot. Affects my daily life, work, and confidence. I always wanted to have a "normal" skin. There's nothing wrong with self-improvement for the betterment of ourselves especially in terms of health. What's not good is to change to conform to the always changing, superficial standard of beauty set by the mass media or social media. Let's be comfortable wearing our own skin, shape, color and size. Sending love to all of you
This is so fun.. great song.. empowering teen self esteem by singer who done cosmetic surgery :)
I feel like the original version pushed way more boundaries at the time than this one did
I'm Beautiful 😭💕
I'm crying now, because 20 years ago I was about to end it and thought I won't make it through high school. This song helped me a lot growing up as the "queer" kid. Thank you so much, Christina. My hero. Damn, this song hits even harder today.
Love it 🥲
I quit Instagram.  She helped me remind me of my self worth again. Thank you Christina 🥲
Brilliant!
When will I feel beautiful when the world keeps throwing me of WHAT THE STANDARD SHOULD BE, when everytime I look at the mirror, all I can see are those laughter from my peers and their disgusted look reflecting back at me? How can I feel beautiful when I tried to be, they always keep reminding me everything that is wrong with me.   This is a beautiful song, hope it could help me lift up my self and appreciate me more. I have no problem with me being a normal, simple human being but when the whole world keeps telling you to keep up to the trend of the standard beauty, I just can't seem to smile my way through it.
teens and kids need to be their age. not too much on social media that affects mental health. this is a very strong message ...go out and enjoy outdoors with other kids ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏
Thank god you rerelease this
🤍
This SONG IS MY THEAM SONG OF MY SELF WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND I TILL NOW👏👏😢😢😢😭
BEAUTIFUL MESSAGE 🙏🏼❤️🔥✨
This song is so relevant in today's generation. Social media dictates what is beautiful and what is not. I hope the young people of today will stop using social media to validate their apperance, their lifestyle and basically their existence.
'This needs to change', but latinos, gays, trans, people with disablilities, amputee and ugly FAT people is not allowed.
Beautiful
Beautiful song. Too bad the artist that sings it doesn’t believe in the songs message
👏👏👏
'This needs to change', but the Kardashian-Jenner, super skinny models, 'beauty makeup' vloggers and YouTubers, Christina Aguilera herself full of botox-Restylane and lip fillers, perfect Instagram rich models and so many others examples, don't let this happen, and sadly, this never gonna change.
This INCREDIBLE. Thank you 😍
this song saved so many lives 💞
Would of been great to see more plus size people on this video. One isn't enough.
I wish that she would have sang and updated version of the song
The video of the century!
Miss those times when “body positivity” was actually a positive thing…
One of the most Beautiful song ever created. Love the message, and it's much needed for today's society ever.
No Matter Who you are, GOD LOVES YOU !!
Watching this video makes it feel like I’m listening to the song for the first time. 😢 such a powerful message 💕
this song makes nico avocado validated.
I remember this like it was yesterday !
😭
just like the past and now it’s still the same and once again this song brings me comfort
So creepy this video 😭
This hits harder now. The perfect depiction of what we are teaching our children and the generations to come.  If you are reading this and feel some kind of low because of what you see in IG or whatever internet is showing you, know that what you see on IG or anywhere in the internet isn't real but YOU ARE REAL AND YOU ARE PERFECT JUST THE WAY YOU ARE! ❤
... and 20 years later I continue to love this song and our imperfect Christina.  Are we so old?
Heard this when it came out and it hit home and now I’ve got a kid and seeing todays kids missing out because on tech and competing to be beautiful it always been there but internet has made it worse due to filters. It’s sad kids are no longer kids. I’ve kept my kid away from social media and is not allowed any because I believe kids should be kids and not trying to be adults. Trees are for climbing and grass is for running in go play and enjoy being alive coz one day you won’t be able to and it’s too late. We are all beautiful.  It’s like the matrix everyone plugged in on tech hiding behind reality and the few  remaining are living.
Loved it
Bellísima canción. Los niños y adolescentes deben de vivir su vida de forma feliz , jugando y divirtiéndose. Cuidemos su inocencia y su esencia ❤️❤️
I cannot believe this song was released 20 years ago, I was 11 at that time. The re-release of this music video could not have come at a better time such as now.
❤️
May Allah guide you to the Islam the only one religion that is chosen by God and only be accepted. This is the only one way till we will return to our Creator
message on this video is deep as hell !!! xtina ur still and always be our angel
Never really listened to this song the first time around, not sure why it even came up on my feed. There is an incredibly powerful message here that is more poignant now than ever before 💜💜
Growing up, i always to this song because i was so insecure when i was a kid, people around me calling me names even until now, but its  less hurting not like before. I am so thankful that this song is still relevant in every generation we have and hoping that more people especially kids can understand the meaning of the lyrics and use it to boost they're confidence.
Let's face it, we needed this. How the hell has our society once again become so obsessed with physical beauty, when if you love someone they should be beautiful to you either way?
Beautiful ❤️
parece a musica da pit
As much as I love Christina she became everything she was singing about in this song.
♥️
❤️
Tears after tears overflowing in my face, this song 20 years later, still hits today.  Thank you, Christina for the reminder 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
This video proves where society is going ... it’s got worse instead of better , this was truly dark , but a true representation of where the majority of children and people are heading , as much as we’d like to think most children will happily run off and play with a tree swing , in reality they won’t - they’ll still be addicted to there phones and will still not ever feel good enough because of the shit standards of society . It’s our jobs now as parents no longer teens , to help our children as much as we possibly can , or will the rendition of this music video in another 20 years will be even scarier . The children are our future , let’s be the generation that breaks the chain 💯💛
Im having lunch with make up on and watching this video …suddenly my tears fall, ruined everything 😭.. this song still hits me hard as it’s not easy being a transgender
Confident is beautiful. Love yourself.
Thank you Christina. Thank you.
This song always made me cry, but this time especially. Social media doesn't just influence our body image, it influences us spiritually as well. Most of us want to belong so much that we give in to it all, we start to compare, compete, keep track of who achieved bigger things. We're never satisfied with where we are. And there's so much loneliness, now! When we can connect with people from all over the world! And so many bad feelings if we don't meet societal expectations. I've been off Facebook and Instagram for 2 years and it was one of my best decisions ever. For the first time I started to feel like myself. Now I even deactivated Whatsapp. Yes, it's hard peeling off feelings of guilt, why I'm not available at all times and shit, but I feel it's definitely worth it in the long run. All I have left is YouTube haha, because I feel I would literally die if I'd go in complete isolation. This world is really getting out of hand...
Love love love Christina...
Ahhh harika bir müzik, anlamlı bir klip. Mükemmel olmak zorunda değiliz ve mükemmel dediğimiz şey kötüdür bana göre. Biz eksik parçalarımızla bile güzeliz, farklılıklarımızla bile bir bütünüz aslında. Teşekkürler bütün güzel yorumlar ve bu harika video için. Herkese izleteceğim.
Bonito mensaje acorde con la actualidad, gracias Christina 🇲🇽💪❤👏👏👏👏
I’m currently 20 years old. I’m living in one of the Asean third world countries. I’m still ON and OFF on my *obsession to change my body. But 80% Now I love myself, 5’5’ 79Kg and brown skin, Flat nose  I really love latino and westernize mix blood appearances. For the past 10 years ( yes since 2011 ), i really wish why i born this way. Big nose, short, dark skin, small eyes and FAT.  Compare to those “foreigners”, i ask myself in the mirror every single minutes everyday *Why am i so ugly who can love this ugly goblin**  I always love to look in the mirror and manifest any power to change my physical body
Much needed re release !!! :)
Iconic
The song still retains relevance, especially now more than ever. Thank you.
Xtina really said “you’re worthy of getting help”
If you have an instagram page and you claim to be a “fitness inspiration”, you are contributing to the problem.
Another 20 years and we will still need an updated version of this "Beautiful" song/reminder. I hope younger generations won't forget the message of this song.
I heard this song once on the radio years ago and only remembered the tune. I always wanted to find it. Now, years later, this video came up on my recommended page just days after my best friend called me fat and cyber-bullied me. The universe's timing is beautiful, just like everyone reading this ❤
TIMELESS!❤
Thanks after 20 years remind me again how originally beautiful I am..
I love youu
Masterpiece.
i’ve been depressed for so long because i am fucking ugly but i really wanna be able to think i am beautiful.
She should've dropped it in May or June 😢
its sad that after all this time we didn't learn anything.
So boriiiiiiiiing. 2002 version Is epic
OMG I LOVE THJIS VIDEO! The ending is sooooooo
I wish all generations, colors, ethnicities, genders, heights, weights, would watch this new video and transform their mind to the message of this song.
Love this song, but I just feel like they missed the opportunity with this video. It could have been so much more.
WOW it even has more impact today i think! With all social media and stuff.... THANK YOU!
Social media has also tricked many audlts into thinking being a 'digial nomad' is the best way of life.
Linda Perry may have written this song, but Christina made it so special.
OMG, tears within the first 30 seconds into the video. This is so true!
This is so deep !
❤❤❤
pesan moral : bersyukur dengan apa yg kita punya. gausah perduliin ucapan orang lain mengenai kita. Allah sudah merancang fisik kita dgn sebaik2nya <3
Wow
Excelente mensaje!
The perfect song and video for the Gen Z generation. I hope they'll learn(even adults), that the important thing is to be healthy! Changing your looks, trying to bleach your skin etc... won't help if you're mentally, emotionally and physically sick. I've been there, learned so much and realized that when I started loving myself and going for the healthy lifestyle route, that's when I glow! My skin became radiant, my mind is clear to the point that from battling depression and anxiety...I went to study Psychology and graduated from it. My aunt used to tell me as a teen that it doesn't take a lot of money to take care of yourself/overall health, she's right! Also, stop comparing and measuring yourself to others, it will never make you happy.
Lihat video klip nya sangat menyentuh hatiku,sesuai dengan keadaan sekarang. Media sosial kadang membuat anak ingin terlihat dewasa dari umurnya dan terlihat sempurna dimata temannya,di situ kadang yang membuat mental mereka terganggu.
Still only beautiful if skinny. That tracks with every decade. When will I be beautiful to you all?
She really pointed out the toxic "bro culture" obvious-seeming, steroid-induced "natural" call to bodybuilding to the younger male generation.   Thank you, Miss Aguilera.
It’s hard for me to respect a celebrity that has undergone plastic surgery herself while trying to spread a message of body positivity and beauty to others, but I am not Christina nor do I share her mind. Perhaps she is happy with where she is now and what she looks like. And at the end of the day, if she is comfortable with herself, that’s really the true message. Regardless of what you look like or what you have done to get there, accepting and loving yourself as you are in this moment, even with imperfections, I believe, is the message of this song. I’m a recovering addict with mental health issues. I have scars all over my body from past harm and use. I could lose some weight, probably improve my diet and skincare routine, but I am beautiful, no matter what they say, and in every single day.  One day at a time. May anyone reading this also find self-acceptance and inner peace.
Beautiful, I don't have another word! Realy beautiful 🌻
Wow brings back some memories. Thank you Christina ❤
Everyone says to me why arent you on Instagram or go on Facebook more ? This is why ? People post only snapshots of their lives (usually only the good moments) and it makes you feel rubbish -i honsetly think social media is toxic and teens shouldnt be allowed on it till a certain age x
What about adults they also got issues
CAN THE INTERNET STOP MAKING ME CRY PLEASE
This song will always be good
❤
Powerful
depois que vi esse clipe aumentou a vontade de fazer cirurgia plástica
We need this now more than ever. Authenticity is your superpower. Be Yourself!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
this song is an anthem to all gay kids then and now, thank you for this gift Christina ❤️
:( i feel bad for you 😔
Muy buen mensaje  en el vídeo dejemos de ser tan superficiales con  lo que nos ponen en redes sociales  amarnos como somos es lo más hermoso de la vida ❤️
This song is ageless and much needed to hear in this generation. Thank you for reviving with accurate story video Christina Aguilera! Everyone needs to watch this ♥♥♥
Maldita tecnología q cada día hace q nuestros niños y jóvenes se comparen con lo irreal q les venden las redes sociales haciendo q pierdan su autoestima e incluso las ganas de vivir 😔💔
Kids being kids, I wish we could see that again soon
💗
True fact : the women born to make history.
YES IF DISNEY can remake movies and other films can be re booted Music should be re introduced like this Great song 🎵
xtina forever 🥰🥰
They don't make this kind of music nowadays, anymore...
One of the most beautiful and inspiring song ever written.. I loved it 20yrs ago when I was single.. I still love it now that I have a 10yr old beautiful daughter.. ❤️❤️❤️
God, this video is so important. I loved every bit and the messages it delivered. Kids (who are not even pass 10 yet) today are so caught and glued to the media and are influenced by influencers and other people to try to look like them. The ending of this video was so pure and hit me so hard and made me miss what we were like as kids, playing outside, going to the park, playing with friends. A good and healthy childhood is so important, I don't want any kids thinking that the media can do them any better.
La realidad actual 🥲
♥️
Did she rerecord too or just new video?
🔥♥️🔥
Adaptado a los tiempos, me encanto. ❤
God bless you for this, Christina.
omg this Video is PERFECT .. absolutely amazing and ya it's really needed!!! our kids live in a world that getting crazier and crazier every day...
I Love You Christina!! You is very necessary this world.  ♥
Brings me back like caspers lullabye
Una canción que acaricia mi corazón 🥺
Indeed.
Y bueno.... no lo tomen a mal fans.... pero tengo una observación  , y es q ahora q esta canción vuelve a proyectarse y centrándome en lo de alcanzar una belleza con operaciones para cambiar tus facciones y tu identidad única... o sea se supone q el mensaje de la canción está  claro , pero hmm... Christina Aguilera q me dices de ti al cantar esto y ya tener varias operaciones q obviamente son muy visibles en su rostro . Hace años me pareció bien siendo ella  natural ...pero ahora como q no le va la canción,  la hubiera dejado nomas allá en el pasado ...x favor no se amarguen x mi comentario ....aunque no lo crean yo también me considero fan ..
This were so powerful and it still powerfull!!!
Still feel new song
the undeniable power of xtina
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💕✨🥲🥲
Me horroriza ver como niñas pequeñas están sometidas hoy en día a estándares de belleza que realmente a mi me preocuparon a partir de los 20 ....
remastered masterpiece
This song is always overwhelming ❣️ always hits hard 💯
🥺🤍
Esta no porque lloro 😢
I love this message! This is such a powerful message to young children who are insecure with body image. We are beautiful inside and out no matter what body we have. There is NO right way to look beautiful.
2 words. Still beautiful. 💖
I may be a big Britney fan in the 2000s but I also loved Xtina. Stripped is one of the best albums to ever come out from the 2000s and to this day it’s still as uplifting as it was 20 years ago.
Holy shit these kids weren’t even born when the original came out! I feel like I’m already o-word lol
To all who feel judged, who feel the pressure of being perfect, may you know that you are beautiful just the way you are. Don’t the conformities of the world get to you❤
nope, still ugly.
this song is an anthem 🙌
the song  transcends time  this song got me through  touf time in my life love you Christine
So long ago, so current
I was just talking about this with my husband, I'm still young, born in 1995, but to see how this generation of teens are now from how I was in my teens is insane. Its so danaging and it breaks my heart. It was hard then and I cant even imagine how hard it is now. I always thought social media was damaging the minute I remember Instgram being invented. It has grown into a monster that only destorys. We can not cancel social media but we can put out better content.
❤️😭😍
❤️💜💙
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Beautiful song. Too bad she hasn't been more consistent with positive messaging for women and girls. She has only added to the sexualization of young women. If only she'd take responsibility for her part that she's played.
20 years later this song still hits true! It’s all about Loving Yourself And to see yourself as beautiful, because EVERYONE Is Beautiful in their own special way and WE ALL HAVE WORTH AND VALUE!
Christina transcending time with this classic powerhouse vocal.. I loved it 20 years ago and I love it still to this day! WORK MAMA, YES GOD!
WHY AM I CRYING
This song is still amazing and more relevant than ever!
As many surgeries as xtina has had though ummm girl!!
The most beautiful song of Cristina
My kids don’t have phones nor allow on any media. The media is 🤮 messed up and my kids don’t need to be near it.  Kids are kids, having fun and being themselves is what’s best, so sad seeing elementary kids on their phones before school and after.  Even kids younger than my daughter who 9 have phone and social media.  I am glad I grew up with common sense.
let kids be kids. thank you for this
it's like every things got worst in two decades. More awareness on this matter is a priority
This, the original video, and fall in line feels like they can be related
❤💚
I get the meaning of this video and the song, and the messages and you are Beautiful and no matter what they say and oohh and dont you bring me down the horizon.
omgggg it’s so nostalgic i luv it
damn. and I thought the original was powerful when I was in high school. I don't know how these kids do it with social media. I was 15 when Facebook was created. breaks my heart.
I cried when I was 7 and now with almost 18 I do it again🥺
Simply delete ALL SOCIAL MEDIA that is causing this harm to ppl (instagram, facebook, tik-tok) ! We don't need this sh"t.
Christina, this is just what I needed. I was in tears after watching this because before I was in the mindset that any song like this one was just marketing. I strongly disagree now. I definitly think that social media plays a huge role in body image in young people, myself included. This song is beautiful and the music video is very powerful.
Después de muchos años, esta canción cobra sentido.
cried
Didn’t expect to cry when I clicked the video, since I am so familiar with the song from 20 years ago. The message of the song becomes even more important today 😢🥹
The world 🌎is in such turmoil. ❤
Thank you, Christina♥
No me esperaba esto 😮😮😮❤❤❤
La luz?
I disagree with this song. "You are beautiful, no matter what they say." Uh no, there are people who are quite literally toxic poison. Narcissistic people for example, who literally gas light your perception to make you think you are the problem.  Hard to say "you're the problem," to someone who quite literally believes they are everything."  Obviously, this song is for the average, self-esteem challenged individual but still... There are problem people who make this song their anthem, and they are the most horrible people you can meet. Also, incredibly influential to the point everyone else wants to be.  The cycle will never end. Why should it... it's profitable.
😢
Almost 2 million in less than a week. Let's go! I love you Xtina.
الفديو ماشي تمام  لحد الدقيقة   3:28  نتفلكس:كان لازم ادخل
Euphoria?
Powerful, emotional and much needed in today's world. Thank you for this.
ABSOLUTELY ICONIC
so grateful for this song
Afortunadamente en 2002 (yo tenía 16 años) apenas había redes sociales y poca gente tenía Internet, yo incluída. Si lo hubiese tenido no sé cómo lo hubiera llevado, porque como muchos otros adolescentes yo tenía muchos complejos con mi aspecto y mi autoestima estaba muy baja. La verdada que cada vez vamos a peor.  Este es un gran ejemplo de cómo las RRSS están haciendo mucho daño a nuestros actuales niños, adolescentes y jóvenes.
We need this  in 2022 ... thank you
Is this new vocals?
Remember their is nothing wrong with you, You are amazing as you are, dont be afraid to be yourself. Show the love you want to receive.
Still balling 😫 20 years later. ❤
This song is so awesome, I cry every time I hear it!
Christina Aguilera querida !!! Muita emocionante " Beautiful " com vida de  adolescente e crianças cresce demais  , clipe perfeito
🥲🥰❤
So beautiful song. Thank you!
Are u tickling my nipples or did Christina just give me chills again after 2 decades
This was probably one of the first pop songs that was released with such meanings because as far as I remember none of the mainstream songs during 2001 to 2005 had lyrics such as this.
Icónica siempre...
Bahhhh chorei, muito lindo 😭
Just... Wow... This generation Needed this like chicken soup for the Soul, You Actually Saved lives with this, just like you saved Me in my teen years with this album. I STILL HAVE IT TODAY THANK YOU CHRISTINA ❤️‍🩹🙌🏼👏🏼👏🏼 THANK YOU
histórico
Precisamos de mais Christina nesse mundo ❤❤❤
Thanks Christina  now Im going  to get a BBL LMAO 🤣 🤪 😂 😆 🙃
This is so needed!!!!
How was i feeling this song so hard 20 years ago. I was just 7. Please explain.  Haha
I always loved this song because it shows that oy doesn't matter what size you are or color you are beautiful inside and out 💜💜💜💜
back to my childhood memories...this time I'm only 16yrs n now im 36... Christina u r my idol!!
We live in a world where everyone is taught they need to change themselves to follow the current agendas instead of encouraging them to love themselves as they are.
Lmfaoooo she is the first to make surgerons lol big contradiction.
El primer video jamás será superado! Tenia como un toque más melancólico! Pero sin duda es una canción que marco mi pre adolescencia 🎉❤🥹  y uno debe amarse como es, aunque los estándares de belleza no ayuden mucho….. ❤
thank you !
Thank Christina for reminding the new generation.❤️
Its ironic coming from someone like her. She's basically saying, love yourself the way you are and feel but she's the one getting all these plastic and cosmetic procedures.
You made me cry again Xtina.... Beautiful song!! God bless you my Queen!!
Sheemss 😭😭
Love this version! The kids these days and everyone in general really needed this! ❤️❤️
This could not be any closer to the truth. Growing up in the age of social media in its infancy was tough enough, and today it has just gotten completely jacked up. I understand a lot of people claim to use social media as a means of self empowerment, and a lot actually do, but the majority of people who use it just use it as a way to be seen and heard because they feel they aren't being seen or heard in the real world. People's obsession with their "online personas" is so disgusting to me. JUST BE YOUR F*CKING SELF. F*ck what other people have to say about you and focus on your overall health and mental health. From there great things can and will happen. Life is a carousel of ups and downs and if disengaging in social media makes you feel better then listen to yourself. As adults we have enough to worry about as it is.
Wow I was 10 when this first came out. It was amazing then, but its message is so necessary now.
beauty stereotypes will always hunt us... although it's true that social media has enhanced it, during the 2000s it was as cruel as it is today. What's more, there wasn't even the 'every type of body is ok' paradigm
I'm ssssssssooooo and will FOREVER be in love with the goddess that is Xtina
Didn’t even need to see it to give it a like. But staying for the good cry. Thanks, Christina for this timeless treasure ❤😢
I'll take this over Taylor Swifts new garbage any day 😊 can't wait to share it with my daughter!
Meanwhile conservatives want to normalize bullying again. Not just with the "don't say gay" bill in Florida, but in a myriad of schools across the country. They overwhelm the school board meetings like good Karens & Kens as they know best ...
This was a favorite back then. I was bullied, I was called ugly (still being called ugly) but this song brought me comfort.
The video is like a episode of Black Mirror
Relevant to today’s societies. Brand owners and investors, plastic surgeons and influencers… You are responsible!
I'm so glad I grew up as a kid when there was no social media, I think it would have destroyed me
This is so heartbreaking. Everyone go hug your babies. Our youth today have so many struggles growing up.
I was a little girl when "Stripped" changed my life, I grew up keeping in mind one of the realest and deepest albums, it formed part of who I grew up to be. Up to this day, this song sings straight into the soul, thank you now and always, let's bring this masterpiece to more generations
"Don't look at me."
THIS WILL ALWAYS BE TIMELY AND RELEVANT.
Absolutely amazing song & video.  (My eyes are wet as the grandfather of over 13 beautiful kids. )
This song was undoubtedly ahead of its time
I was watching this and on the 2:29 - 2:31 where the background was just black I happen to see my reflection and I am staring at myself. and I don’t know, I rarely look at the mirror and look at myself but something hits different. a tear fell down my eye. This song really hits hard even after so many years. I needed this today.
Cuando era adolescente, esta canción me hacía llorar, y escucharla otra vez para las nuevas generaciones me vuelve a hacer llorar... Beautiful...
People now adays should hear this and relate to it 🥰
🙌👑🙌 thnk u !!
Hopefully she does a new video for “Keep on singing my song” ❤
im 42 old,im beautiful...im 52 old,im beautiful..
Awesome
Hits so poignantly as the debate over gender reassignment for children is going on in our society.
Wow. I couldn’t stop the tears. This is exactly what this new generation needs.
I don't really cry much, but this had me bawling like a baby.
https://youtu.be/Rk_sAHh9s08
So relatable
Best song she’s ever made
Que lindo!! Lembrou Black Mirror. Adorei a mensagem - especialmente no final. Show
It is definitely some of the older generation who are making us younger generation commit suicide and change how beautiful we already are. It is very sad. To all my younger generation: We can do this. Keep going and love yourself. We matter too.     💜😭
OMG It's made me Cry! I have been battling anxiety and depression for 4 years!!! I can see myself in this Video.
Old is Gold
Muito bom. Sempre lembro da Gina dançando essa música kkk
❤️‍🔥🤗❤️
No me hace falta ver el video entero para darte las gracias chris por sacarlo de nuevo ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I guess this is a difficult topic to discuss. In one hand, we have the issue of people risking their lives to fit a beauty estandar; in the other hand, you have people risking their lives because they "acept themselves" the way they are. It's very difficult to transmit that you need to love yourself, but love yourself doesn't mean to not care about the condition of your body, but to actually care about your body. When you stop eating to be slim, you are not caring about your body, but if you eat more than what your body needs, you're not caring about your body either.... This video shares only one side of the coin like all the videos about this because it's very difficult to transmite the correct message:   Love yourself means taking care of your body and treating it with the respect it deserves: Eat healthy, eat enough, do the required amount of exercise every day, drink enough water, sleep enough, care about your mental health, don't do anything that can harm your body.
and then i cried (again)-
Thanks you so much
One of my all time favourite songs. Just pure amazing! Thank you for this anthem.
It’s actually gotten harder to grow up now vs back then
This was so groundbreaking when it was originally released.
This is so touching and real and beautifully done, that almost made me cry... There is something really beautiful in the fact that this song has ended up to be considered a term. I  mean, not only the word as a word, but even the whole song and the work that has been putted into it, which was again made for 2022 and it honestly gave me goosebumps. It hits hard, because the way it was made, the scenes it showed, the expressions of the people, the message that it carries/passes and the information that it gave at the end, are heavy and powerful. It's so sad that such things exist, but the message of the song goes to show that we are beautiful the way WE are. We are our own selves and no one can take this from us, even if at times it seems like they did.  And that's the beautiful part of it. That we are our own unique and special selves and we can do WHATever we want with that. Congratulations to the creators of the song and of the videoclip, from the vocals, to the camera work, from the make-up to the wardrobe department, from the caters to the location directors and to whoever participated in their own way into this creation etc
We need this for today's youth.
WTF please context this have suicide themes?????
This hits so hard… had to take some deep breaths while watching and intaking the video
Wow, this song are everlasting
QUEEN
She's not even on the video... whoever paid money for this is stupid.
4.2Kth Commented 💙
Something about a celebrity who's had botox, lip fillers, cheek fillers, jaw contouring, breast treatments and nose fillers, telling people their beautiful seems wrong. The message is great but unfortunately it's the celebrity culture of falsified beauty that is adding to the hatred of one's natural self.
What's the difference?
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I’m crying
The 90s baby in me is still crying because we still have the same problems.
Such a sad world we live in. i wish tv never existed.. no movie stars no celebs at all..
Let’s share this message especially to the Kartrashians, stop poisoning the world with your fake standards of beauty
Tive que logar só pra curtir esse vídeo. Incrível.
and they cast only really pretty people :/
I had self-confidence issues 20 years ago and this song gave me strenght in the path to self-love. Thanks for this and recreating the video to our changed world. I have showed my daugther and will show anyone I see needs this song to lift up their spirit.😘
OMG!!! 3s hermoso!!!!
it´s crazy to think that this message is still needed today
this song will be iconic until the end of mankind.
this hits different
you helped me younger when they made me hate myself for nothing, i saw how the world was turning and did not expect this miracle song to come back. i know it may not be the place but kelly rowland also released a similar energy song "stole". I hope the energy will reach the people and made em realise how we're all beautiful.
Omfg this song made me cry as a little kid and now as an adult
Thank you 🙏
Definitely getting TLC Unpretty vibes just a little
😭
I was already a goth kid in 2002, but this song has such an important message. It speaks so much to me since the first time I listen to it. I cried again. So sad it's still so true two decades later...
So good.  So important.  So beautiful.
OMG lloré mucho porque hace 20 años tenía 12 añitos y me identifique 1000% con esta canción y hoy veo el video y soy mamá de una pequeña de 1 año y 4 meses y es todo lo que quiero para ella, que pueda amarse como es y que lo que es, es perfecto! La amo muchisimo y solo espero pueda ser feliz siempre por como y no por lo que llegaría a ser por de acuerdo a lo que otros digan!  GRACIAS! espero escucharla en 10 o 20 años más porque serguira siendo igual de iportante y relevante como lo fue hace 20 años y como lo es hoy en día!
When I was 15/16 and would bunk off school with about ten mates at one other friends house several times a week. In 2002. Dirrty would play continuously everyday. Young girls would watch that video (which is very sexual and graphic when you’re a teenager and coming of age) and the amount of girls that felt insecure watching it and the amount of girls that would them emulate the dance moves and mannerisms to impress males. Just makes me feel that xtina is a tad of a hypocrite when she is trying to rose tint spect the  2002 era and also disregard her own huge impact on adding to young girls insecurities at the time. Beautiful literally followed straight after and the message conflicted entirely with the damage that dirrty caused to young girls body image.
I needed this today❤
Music video hits hard...Painfull reality
Love the ending … kids should be having fun being a kid and living their lives… 🥹🥹
This is needed
Em 2002 vc me emocionou, me fez chorar e trouxe representatividade para mim. Um jovem gay, de uma cidadezinha de interior no Brasil. Com seu clipe, você me fez perceber que estava tudo bem ser gay, que eu era sim normal e lindo sendo quem eu sou. Sua música e seu videoclipe com certeza me ajudaram muito naquela época de descobertas e auto aceitação. E assim como me ajudaram, tenho certeza que ajudaram e ainda ajudam milhares de pessoas ao redor do mundo.   E agora você conseguiu me emocionar novamente, atualizando para os dias atuais e trazendo outras questões para a discussão com esse clipe maravilhoso. Sei que provavelmente você nunca lerá isso que estou escrevendo, mas escrevo mesmo assim. Pois, preciso lhe agradecer! Beautiful não é apenas uma música ou um videoclipe, beautiful se tornou um "salva vidas" para aqueles que em muitas vezes não tem para onde correr, para onde pedir ajuda, ou que apenas precisam se sentir, beautiful naquele momento, pois, devido a vários fatores nunca se sentiram assim. E vc conseguiu isso, com essa obra.   Obrigado Christina Aguilera e Linda Perry, por continuarem salvando vidas até hoje. 💙🙏❤
But words can bring you down, more than ever. Every bad comments you make is a killer.
Incredible song such a great message ❤️
Retrata perfectamente la exigencia en todos las edad a ser PERFECTO destruyendo a cada ser humano por tener que ser hegemonico sin darse cuenta que uno es hermoso como es.
Thank u xtina
I'm the same age as Christina and it hurts so much that this song is more relevant than ever. Decades later it shouldn't be, but here we are... aren't we all tired of it, yet?
Coming from an entertainer who has had plastic surgery done...
Casually balling at work nbd 😭
This song helped me through a tough depression episode back when I was a teenager going to College. My mom was sick, I have to go to college and I have insecurities being tall and being able to "blen in". Turns out I definitely have to stand our and not to blend in among other things, challenges and obstacles that I have in life.   This song was very well written and was very well sung by Christina. This is still in my playlist til now. For days or moments when I feel so down and like nothing goes right. It is definitely not just a game changer but a life changer for me.
Every kid in there is so hegemonic tho...   Not even 1 person with a mobility problem or any kind of disability.... wierdyysh I mean... i love this song but i dont see human diversity
Wish it was like the end of the video. Where kids actually go out and play and be children. Instead of staying at come and consuming so much toxic crap on their devices.
Was this on film?
Beautiful video, beautiful message.
Crying as hard as when I was 13 y/o
I'm only 24 but I feel so bad for the kids born in the years after me. They go through so much. At least we got to be kids for the most part
Chorei que nem uma cachorra 😭😭😭
It’s still mostly skinny kids “insecure”…. It’s not healthy to skinny kids dying from bullying. It’s nice to show the correlation to mental health, but it’s still fat kids and the rainbow kids most effected by body issues.
Timeless song. Every generation needs it.
The voice, the lyrics, the music… thank you Christina!
So powerful 👏
Yesssss ❤ Thank you for releasing this song again and with this powerful video ❤️🤍 Perfect timing. We need it.
i love u
thank you Christina Aguilera .
THANK YOU ❤️❤️❤️
She is so real for this 😭😭😭
That song is icónic travel the time
La mejor!!!! GRACIAS 🙏🏻
A gorgeous song with a powerful message that has stood the test of time. And as film nerd, I am really loving the Kodak 35 mm for this video. Amazing colors.
Uff, las primeras notas de Christina y tengo toda la piel de gallina. 😢
Oh wow. So relevant now.
Wow the way kids and young people have had their lives stolen by social pressure to look perfect and by social media. The girl wanting more curves really hit because that is so relevant and no one ever talks about it.
Yes
I love you
A powerful video like the first one, this one captures the reality of the delusional world we live in today with social media. It was better growing up back then with out it.
Money hungry?  There was no need at all to make a new video for this. I feel that the other one stands for itself.  Guess this is a way to make more sales
Que mensaje tan potente! Ojalá que ayude a muchos
You are beaultifull
original was complely better
Wow....this song it's so much inportanting right now than ever. 👏🏻👏🏻 beaultifull ❤
Wenn are beatufull, no matter what they say. 👍
was expecting something more striking than this - instead of repeating the same thing again and again we see every day. The original video was genius but this video is no more than a high school script.
Que lindo!!!!!
😭😭😭😭
A classic that will go on for generations! 🎶
When it showed them playing in the tree like normal kids I CRIED 😢
wow this is powerful 👏
This song is so beautiful. ❤️
Beautiful was one of my favorite songs growing up as a kid in the early 2000s, this brought tears to my eyes as the message is so powerful. As a gay man in my early 20s I am consumed by social media's unrealistic body standards. This song reminds me that I am beautiful just the way I am. You will forever and always be one of my biggest idols. Christina, Thank you.
made me cry <3
♡♡♡♡♡
The irony in the decision to use only good-looking people in this video does not escape me.
Eu sabia que seria incrível, só não sabia que eu iria chorar na primeira vez que assisti, e me arrepiar todas as outras vezes em que eu assistir... Que música, que vídeo, que cantora. Que tapa na cara. BEAUTIFUL!
lovely message
The fact that they had to use such young people because the message is addressed to them makes me cry. These are kids! Not even fully teens, just kids! YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!  This society is f*cked up! the song is is timeless <3
this song is so necessary right now!!
This video is incredibly powerful and more relevant than ever.
Shit 20 years has gone by in the blink of an eye.  The song always hits the core of my heart and melts me down. I remember struggling as a queer person and this song always cheers me up 💕💕.
Until we cut our soo called "freedom" to use social medias non-stop, things won't change, but things does need to change.
Блять я в восторге, этот клип произведение искусства 🎉 он говорит и показывает что не нужно гнаться за трендами и за модой . А естественность и природная красота от рождения всегда будет в почетной моде 😢
You don't know how much you always touch the feelings it's only takes one voice from you and all those feelings start to show up as it begins you to pop it We love you then and now and forever after❤️
Wow. So powerful
I mean, the song is amazing, but it comes from someone with plastics.. 🤷🏻‍♀️
I cried a lot
Really important message but such an intensely boring singing voice and melody. Seems wasted on the message.
Such a powerful song, how many years have passed? and we have learn nothing as a society!! such a shame!
I love you so much for this song before and now! You  full our souls! ❤🙌🥰
Don't look at me Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is? You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side 'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
Beautiful piece of art Xtina
Goosebumbs
ahahah why am i crying?
There's a study of oblong, asymmetric polygons that roll the same as spheres even though they're not, I think we're all trying to find our "almost round"
CONGRATULATIONS FOR THIS MOVIE CLIP !!!!! It's unfortunatelly a real representation of our society with social media and the impact on young people and i'm agree : this need to change.
Nostalgic
Much much respect to her for including men and their struggles in life as well, many deny that men struggle at all and it’s beyond stupidity. Probs to you Christina!
I sing this song when I’m by myself lol Crying like a baby every time honestly.  This masterpiece helps me to get it together till this day. And to anyone out there who struggles with mental health or any sort of personal trauma just rmr you are not alone and you are loved! ❤
Seeing all these kids/teens in the video being influenced is really true and real! Even though I wasn't getting a boob job at 12yo, that 12yo girl developed an eating disorder. That 12yo girl still hates her natural born looks to this day. I've seen hell and back because of poor mental health- and most of my mental health concerns originated from societal pressures.
So many people that need to take accountability for this.  Especially the Kardashians
Wow I definitely got chills watching this. wow 💖
All the tears.
Am I the only one who thought the girl on the thumbnail was Maddy from Euphoria? 😂
Xtina just want to say Thank You again 🥰
This video brought me to tears, this is so important. Thank you for making this video, as a mother all I want is for my child and all children to grow up in a safe, loving, caring world where they feel accepted and cherished.
Perfeita demais a mensagem, novamente.
I miss that time 1st vid came out
Great song, great video, great message from a great voice!
The lyrics, the voice, the video, the message at the end... Just WOW and THANK YOU
Beautiful (version 2.0)
Still battling with my body image. It's been years, I'm not a teenager anymore, but it's still hard. Some days are easier than others, though. I wonder if I'll feel completely fine with myself until the day I die one day or I'm truly damaged forever.
Since 2002 this song still speak to me. Thank you for your work thank you for remind us we are all beautiful
Miles de videos saca al pedo y ni a los 100 millones llega
This is a way to reality-check for everybody who is dealing with mental health, I remember this back then this music video of bullying, self-acceptance, and background looks and accepting it for who we are!
Danke für diesen Weckruf. Wir müssen uns beschützen, aber vor allem unsere Kinder!
Christina..... luv this! still a fan after all these years! keep up the amazing work!
Kids actually playing outside?!? I thought I’d never see it
Recuerdo que de niña escuchaba esta canción porque no entendía mi delgadez, haciéndome sentir insuficiente para mi madre, y en realidad era porque ella sentía culpa de que otras personas le cuestionaran constantemente por que era delgada. No soy madre pero he aprendido a apreciar mi cuerpo para que cuando tenga una hija o hijo, no tenga que obligarla a tomar vitaminas, suplementos, etc sabiendo que esa es mi contextura y el o ella lo heredará.Yo nunca estuve enferma, mi madre tampoco. Solo no sabíamos lo importante que era amarnos primero.
Bravo ❤❤❤
I can hear this song without cry. When i meet this song, I was 8 years .
I really wish kids lived in a world where they can just be kids.
And we thought life was harder back then…our children are suffering now more than ever 💔
The kids being kids is what made me cry. I have gone to parks and seen kids use the playground equipment to hold their phones while recording TikTok dances . I'll be damned if my children care more about their appearances and fake popularity points over the feeling of running free in the rain or feeling the grass under their toes. Protect their innocence <3
Such a powerful video wow
Se van enojar muchos progres con este video, los que quieren sexualizar a toda costa a la niñez.
This is amazing then and now. I will say that Hollywood/media has created ungodly standards for beauty (along with toxic masculinity), which in turn affected how people portray themselves on social media. Social media is not the problem as long as you have the awareness. Hollywood is the root of the issue.
Yeah I think children should be over 18 in order to be able to handle Social media, They can't even buy a pack of cigarettes or Alcohol same restrictions should apply for that, Thanks Christina for making a beautiful song That after 20 years still is proven to Save many lives 😄💕
I remember crying when I heard the song years ago and saw the original video. I cry as soon as I hear the instruments in the beginning. I wanted to kill myself and battled suicidal thoughts for years. I have been bullied, experienced racism, beaten, and sexually assaulted. I also got passed up for a promotion at my old job and I quit my last job. I start a new job tomorrow but I’m not sure if I made the best decision. Despite all this, I keep pushing through but it’s hard.
THIS is  beautiful
This dong save my life when I was young. Thx <3
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3
Almost made it to the end of the song before the tears began to fall. I bawled my eyes out when this song was first released and now being released again 20 yrs later it had made me cry harder than ever before. Never would have thought I would still have this effect with this song and the album for that matter decades later.
A perfect classic
wow. this is real shit.
🥹🥹🥹🥹
WOW! Goosebumps!
Damn…
THANK YOU SO MUCH for redoing this.  This hits so hard with today's society.   This song is just as powerful today as it was then. THANK YOU 💕
This song is timeless. Christina's voice was always and still is perfect. 20 years ago this song was very important message of self love.  It still is! But the person who sang it than is not the same now, so did she really "practised what she preached",  because now she is full of fillers, botox and had a few  ( beauty) surgeries?  Not a hater, I admire her very much.  It's just that it seems a little bit contradictory now in 2022.  It's just my personal opinion.
😭❤
Still so fucjing powerful! Love you Christina, thank you for this reminder! It's a work of art!
Es un claro ejemplo que debería seguir Britney! Christina con esta poderosa Canción lleno muchos corazones <3
Tanks Xtina tanks so much 😔❤️
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Wonderful Song. I just cried. But it were Tears Full of Joy❤
This 20 years old song will always be legendary.
Omg volvio esta cancion tamhermosa
This song and the video are such an awakening!  Everything that was hidden when I was a young girl in th 60's is presented here hopefully and tastefully.  How different women and men would  be if our desire for acceptance had been a reality and not a dream!
This song made me realize that I am beautiful, no matter what they criticize to me. And also it helps me to saved my mental health. Thank you for this wonderful songs who are encountered body shaming like me. ✨
I just want to say : Thank you Christina ❤
Chorei não nego!
😭😭😭
Excelente mensaje 👏
Boys loved this too ❤️
Love you Christina!!!!!
Es una realidad este clip! Más allá de que la canción es antigua muestra el sufrimiento real de la nueva generación que ya no se aman como son. Y se deprime por querer agradar a seguidores que ni conocen en la redes sociales, agradar a supuestos amigos...
Goosebumps all over and tears coming down 😭 loved this song when it first dropped and even more again. ❤
The original video was much more powerful
Don't Mess with classics.. THIS WAS TRASH
I'm really glad you made this. I needed this song when I was 12, and 12 year olds need it today. Also, my inner child is crying. The media has somehow made me feel even uglier than now that I did then.
This song will never get old or outdated. It'll stand the test of time just like it has for 20 years. And that's because she's speaking truth.
that was just needed
I crying see this new version 😢 I feel little sad with new generation from smartphone 💔 Is anything true what the vídeo show 😔
Xtina!!!! How you gonna make me cry all over again?! LOL But seriously, thank you for speaking up!
jfc  😔😔😔😔  this song was so desperately important to me as a teenager, and to see it updated with modern misery---damn :(
This song is perfect for NOW
Linder wrote this song, all Christina did was perform it. Its a shame she's so vein, all it took was one gig in the UK, where she took the piss out of us. Nah got more respect for Britney under the conservatorship and I'm not a massive fan, but she works fucking hard. If you watch over the years all you can see is her head getting bigger and bigger... It's a shame. Got her tattooed on me! Hmm mobile phone bleeding at the end..? If that's the Xtina burn yours... If only technology never existed to begin with,  ahhh those days ♡♡♡
It made me cry so badly
my god.. how powerful this video is...
Me encantó esta canción desde el primer momento, gracias por está versión.  Podrías escribir algo sobre la comida, no sobre ser flaca ni gorda... Sino ser saludable y hacer ejercicio básico y necesario  Gracias desde ya
everlasting BEAUTIFUL song
you did it again Christina!!
Why don’t you release new things ? This happened  20 years ago 🥱
A bit weird to make a new version, when christina aguilera changed a lot about herself lately
Just watched the first 5 seconds and started crying like a baby. So damn true.
wow ...love this
I'm surprised this doesn't have more views. This song needs to make a comeback, especially now. Beautiful video ❤️
equally as powerful now as it was back then
WOW AMAZING!! MUSIC VIDEOS MATTER!!
This album came into my life at a time where all I ever knew was hating myself, me at 13. This song kept me going and hoping for a better outlook, for a day when I would actually like myself as I am. Now, at 33, this album reminds one of my all time favorites. While I am a shell of my 13 year-old self, while I have got myself out of that vicious cycle, I still have what I call my Ugly Days. The fact that this song is still so poignant 20 years later speaks volumes. The music video then made me cry to hope for a better day at the age of 13. The video makes me cry now seeing that better days are ahead and that I actually accept and love myself as is at the age of 33. Thank you.
I honestly had to pause the video because of all the emotions coming up.
This song never gets old, thank you for this message Christina. ❤
💯
No puedo escucharla cinco segundos x que comienzo a llorar
Wao... 20 years of this song and is still amazing, with a mixture or blending of emotions felt.😲😃🥺 Such a powerful voice 🎤, powerful lyrics 🎵🎼🎶, and the video shows, (sorry for the redundancy), a very powerful message. 🎞📽👍🏻 For help, support, positive messages, joy, unity, and good things is what media, social networks, videos should be...🙏🏻💪🏻
why didn't she re-record the song?
Es auténtico o fan made
these poor children don’t even get a childhood anymore. this was beautifully heartbreaking. things need to change.
😢😢😢this remake video literally made me cry..this is beautiful
You are beautiful in every single way no matter what People say. #Selflove #selfcare #Mindfulness 🫂💗💗💜👍
Lo chocante del asunto es que de lo que más se quejan y es lo que más ejercen. Yo canté esta canción y hasta amenazas de muerte recibí por haber cantado cuando ya casi tengo 60 años. Que además, "no era hermosa" y que debía partir del mundo porque les robaba oxígeno. Saludos, generación de víboras, monumentos a la hipocresía. A mí me vale lo que me digan.
This song saved my life when it came out, I grew up in a very homophobic household, the area I lived was very conservative, every day at school was torture, people would rather make comments and slurs about me than even look at me.  Thank you for making this song, it helped so many people overcome seemingly impossible odds.
This song is an anthem for all those who are struggling with their mental health. I deeply deeply love it now as much as 20 years ago.
This is so beautiful
Can we all agree FINALLY someone out there cares for humanity by showing us how social network and society has become so dull and more dangerous by being glued to a screen? Thank you for reminding us, our newer generations, that we are all  in fact beautiful . At 31 and you made me cry again.Remembering how cruel was it to be at your teens and not being like everyone else around.
Remember being a teen and feeling ugly when this song released. It helped me so much! I grew up very confident in my self. Love your self people, you are unique!
I really needed this. i spent 40 minutes in the shower staring at my body and crying. And now I’m staring at my body and smiling Thank you Christina.
🥰🥰
And at the appointed time this song is needed... thank you Christina Aguilera 🇯🇲♥️♥️🔥🔥🔥
🧑👧😆😃😁😛🥳🎵🇺🇸
The new version made me cry 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️ I love it. So beautiful
I got so emotional thinking about kid me, I started boohoo crying.
The video is so profound!
😭
Starke Aussage,sehr gut!
Watching this makes me love my belly even more🙏🏼❤️ thank u tina
é sobre isso 💞💞💞💞
Thank you ❤️
why didn't she record a new version for it as well? what's the point..?
Evergreen song ❤
This made me cry so hard.  I am 52 years old and I lived in a world where we played outside and no one looked at another trying to compare, tease or think they were better than the other.  Thank you for sharing such an impactful video with our youth of today.  I can only hope that a child will see it and it will change how they view themselves.  I know it impacted me.
Anthem ❤
Christina is a beautiful Legend Isn't she, This Awesome song will reach so many and change many people from this day forward ✨ around the world 🌎😄
Christina, you were the only to say I was beautiful, when I felt ugly as a teen. Thank you for helping me to believe that someday I will feel beautiful. I am beautiful, I do believe it now.
Indeed 👍👍
Antes anos 70: tudo pela pátria Hoje anos 2000: Apaga, me ofende 🤢
Música dos fracassados
Gross. Immediate Tears. No matter how much we try to teach our children to love themselves - media is still pounding out the message that you are never enough unless you look, act and dress a certain way and have lots of $$$ - FUK THAT! ENOUGH ALREADY! I see you, I love you, You Matter, You Are Enough! 💕🌻
This song is my winning piece in every singing competition. ❤❤
Christina is a masterpiece, her music is a masterpiece 💖😀🎊🎊🏆👑💃💐
<3
Yes! This definitely needed to be updated 20 years later.  The youth today don’t realise they are naturally beautiful and they DONT need make up, filters or surgery to be beautiful! Stop copying influencers on IG, they are nobodies!
💃 This song is not just a song it's a Feeling, An Amazing Vibe, This is sooo powerful, uplifting and it makes you feel Brave, This Awesome tune will never get old, ever 😄
Absolutely on point!!! 😢 Beautiful natural and unique gems. Perfect children to be protected from the predators at all costs. Thank you Christina ❤️
Its 2022 and the message of this song is still very relevant up to this date. Thank you Xtina for releasing such beautiful song.
Christina sigue siendo la número uno
Esta canción sigue siendo poderosa y necesaria
Sang by Christina Aguilera who had countless beauty procedures. Congratulations.
pues si christina , las cosas empeoraron en las ultimas dos decadas...pero aun hay esperanza
The importance of this song hasn't lessened at all in the 20 years or so since its release. And this video is just as profound as the original music video was. The most startling image to me was seeing the little girls with the markings on their faces, presumably showing where to make cuts for plastic surgery. My favorite part was the ending, when all the kids go outside and play together to just, well, be kids. This is exactly what we don't allow kids to do anymore.
I can’t imagine how difficult it must be to grow up in such a world. This is why I don’t want kids.
I cry every time.  I'm not beautiful.  I'm a shell of a person just trying to live until I don't.  My family beat me down everyday that I exist. The only man died that thought I was worth anything, my dad.  Now I'm different.
More people especially kids need to see this
Wao, this made me cry ❤️❤️❤️❤️ much love to everyone ❤️❤️❤️
Grandiosa cancion muy buena temazo 👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏
May I ask if this is re-recorded or she used the same track from 2002? Because it sounds EXACTLY the same.
Clipe chato
Such a necesary, and powerful message..nowadays
You have inspired me back when I was 12 as a young gay individual, and you keep doing it now that I'm a 32-years old adult. Thank you for treating us so thoughtfully. ❤
😭😭😭😭😭😭 A masterpiece!
너무 좋아요. 💜사랑합니다.
I really loved it! I just wanted to see more fat children playing around!
It Isn`t Just Children ! = Oh NO = More So Parents and Older Adults that Have Little Clue of How To Use The Internet Properly and rather use it as a weapon against those using it , although it Is true = Less time Sitting and allowing ALL Concentration to be Focused on such and Super focused Does Destroy Lives from = The Inside Out .
🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️
My inner child is so happy to see this. São 20 anos de Stripped, mas quem ganha o presente somos nós. Thank u queen
😢😢😢
Masih suka
As someone who gone through plenty of struggles in my childhood, I later learned that our inner voice can either be our best friend or our worst enemy. It all depends if we have a positive or negative mindset. The beautiful part is, it is our own choice how we want to view ourselves. Strive to be the best version of yourself without standing in anyone else's shadow, be your own light. Wish you all the best!
crying with goosebumps 😶‍🌫
This video was phenomenal. Thank you so much!
This is even more relevant in 2022!
I've been listening to this song recently and thinking it needed to come back! So glad it has
Suffering with Anorexia, I think about and listen to this song often always been an important message xx
Christina motherhood suits you beautifully. Many blessings to you and your loved ones thank you for continuing to inspire motivate  so many.
I LOVE YOU XTINA
Love Myself ❤
Deixar as crianças e jovens serem livres de tanto preconceito numa era em que falamos tantoooo de preconceito…
Ok, wow.
This song will always be relatable for everyone. A classic.
♡
Fazia tempo que não chorava tanto. O MLK que segurou o choro em 2002, desabou hoje vendo esses meninos nas árvores.
I just miss Christina's participation in this video
sad but its true in South and North Americas
So sad that the content of this song is still relevant!!
Love u ❤️
I prefer the old video.
Please subtitulado en español latino
I'M IN TEARS!!!! 💓✨
te amo, xtina <3
Today's "try not to cry" challenge is brought to you by this video. #challengefailed
SO POWERFUL! SUCH AN EYE OPENER MUSIC VIDEO!
This was very powerful ❤
I actually still watch/listen to the original y2k music video up to this day... it's one of my favourite songs. nevertheless, thank you for recreating this music video
Such a much needed song in our modern world 💖
WRONG. Words are powerful.  Words CAN bring me down.  I'm rubber. You're glue. Whatever you say, bounces off me and sticks onto you.
the song is so timeless <3
Everyone throw your phones and smart devices against a brick wall and go touch grass.
Viviamo in un mondo che fa paura, a cosa serve l’arte se non ad affrontare tutto questo? 🙏❤️
It is incredible that a woman who literally deforms her face with cosmetic surgeries and injections to enter the beauty canons wants to sell us this message.  I love you Xtina but that's pretty hypocritical 🤷🏼‍♀️
ahora hay más aceptación de uno mismo y de los demas pero sigue existiendo un porcentaje alto de infelicidad, depresión, distorsión de imagen, que importante es criar a nuestros hijos con amor y cariño.
The light is not out , thank you Christina , but i Hope that change for real what he s mean , thats childs of downsystem
This video highlights how 2022 is absolutely abysmal!!!  Who else misses 2002 ✋️ 😔 Love the warning at the end. 🧡
2022 needed this.
Merci ❤️
Reality now a days! So sad..
Thank you for this powerful and beautiful song and video. It is needed now more than ever. God Bless you Christina
I love this version so much ❤️
BRAVO!
I love to read from so many people who were touched by this song 20 Years ago just like me. I still love to sing it when I am home alone or at the karaoke bar.
Even in now days still make you say wow for the song and the voice 😍😍❤️❤️👏👏🔥🔥
This really help me, thank you
Revisited the extraordinary song of "Beautiful" with a new took of a music video that cut through the trauma of a perfect perceptions.  Kudos to you. Thank you for this message. I feel love all over again with this song.
Love you @xtina. 💛💚💜
thank you, thank you, thank you..
What a way to improve the MV to be as relevant as the song has been and always will be. Wow.
❤‍🩹
I love u Christina ❤
Body positivity and mental health is what we need 🫡
One of my favourite artist.. Since before.. Will always support u xtina.. Xtina forever.. :) fav2 song.. That can lift you up when you are down.. :)
When I got attacked 2 years ago online for my hair my face my weight and even got told my so called age...I was told I looked 55 though only 43 at the time I was shocked then I turned to my bf he took most recent photo of me asking ppl my age all of them guesses in my early to mid 30s were shocked to find out someone said 55. My weight is a struggle when I have arthritis throughout my body but I'm not obscenely fat or grotesque as I was told. So I remembered this song as well as Joey McIntyre song Stay the Same...remind myselfsomeone thinks I'm beautiful no matter what
💓💞❤️👍👍👍
💓💞❤️👍👍👍
I remember when this song came out it was incredible as a pre teen it was my anthem. I do find it ironic that Christina went on to do cosmetic surgery to her face.
Gracias
Brilliant
😍😍😍
My forever favorite ❤️  #2002 #2020
Love this song. Even Christina Apguilera has had surgery. Hollywood and it's unrealistic standards making celebrities change themselves and that makes us wanna change ourselves.
😭❤️🏳️‍🌈🤯🌹
❤
I love the song and this 2022 video but... isn't Christina also full of surgery by now? Don't tell me she doesn't have at least lip injections cuz they are obvious, and wears corsets in her performances to have a nicer waistline. So.... where is the message here? I see this more as pure PR stunt than her actually believing in the words she sings here. And don't get me wrong... she IS beautiful and has aged beautifully. I just can't avoid seeing her doing the things she condemns in this video too: Surgery, tons of make up, trying to look fit, photoshop, etc. Even in her recent poolside photos everything is conveniently placed so we don't actually see her stomach area (and in the one we see it, her body is positioned to stretch everything up), wish she would embrace herself as she claims in this video.
Still a beautiful song n love the msg at the end..it does need to change!!
Its true to the point of how STANDARDS are infiltrated in us since we are children. This video shows the true reality in a beautiful poignant art!
Social media is so toxic
This song so so ….make ourself to wake up and start to change , feel ourself so ugly with two teeth that cannot hide ,…NO.. we actually beautiful. God create us give us and appreciate.
VC É A MAIOR, ENTENDA
Dont you bring me down today 😢
WOW WOW WOW
thank you so much
Diosaq
It so sad that celebrities like Xtina tried to spread a good message about self love, etc while go to surgeons to make their faces and bodies from scratch... Acts are heavier than words.
WOW, how this song is still related to this day and even more!!
chills.. still..
What are the pills that the teen took for?
Thank you for keeping the message alive. I was 13 in 2002, this song was relevant then and even more now.
damn this song is so so so ....beautiful!!!🥰
Amen!
Thank you for releasing this version. A Very timely and relevant move.
Hoy más q nunca you are beautiful in ever single way
body dysmorphic disorder anthem
LLORO
You are showing beautiful people. What about fat people; people in wheelchairs, people missing body parts, people with albinism, people with pimples, people with moles, people with red hair and white eyelashes, people with autism, people who have lived a long time, people with saggy and cellulite skin. Etc. Beauty is also on the inside when you feel you have nothing to offer internally as well as externally. Of course it's sad to people who fit societies standards of beauty who think they are ugly...but what about the people that society thinks to be ugly..they are not truly ugly though. Show that instead. That is the true message.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏
Man fuck the social media, life was different in 2000s then now
Love it! This song is getting more important nowadays  With social media everyday showing us so call “perfect” images  It’s very hard to not compare ourselves
20 years had passed, but this song is still best song for our confidence ❤️
I remembered this as a kid back then I was quite dumb back then never knew what were the things about me and this song showcased such deeds to me knowing that even though I may be at loss I'm still able to become me whatever I intend to do that was until now I'm still the same person still finding my own way in life but I still intend to like what I am
Everyone is beautiful as their own.  No one lives your life instead, only you can live yourself.  Stand still, face and fight against the harsh reality.
Minha gente que coisa mais linda e necessária, já me emocionei com o antigo, esse então! E o mais chocante e triste ver que de 20 anos pra cá muita coisa ainda não mudou-se, mas creio que um dia isso mudará! Obrigado Christina ♥️
Scary reality...
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏  true!!!!!
🤍🤍🤍
Such a great music video! Its just so hard to just be a kid / teenager today.
Lá cruda realidad
She can see us…. Finally someone can see us…
This Song has Aged Well. Still relevant as it was the first time.
OMG THIS SONG BRINGS SO MUCH MEMORIES
💓
Original video was si much better
素敵
This song has been an active part of my entire life. Thank you so much.
Glad to finally hear this!
Ese celular sangrando al final!! 💥
I had knew this song when I was 17. And  now I'm 37. This memory and anything from this song never fly away from me. Now I've got better life with my job, Fitness trainers and predictors. Thanks a lot that teach me stronger, healthier and love myself.
The original version is my favorite but u are a great artist I love your work 😊
Omg!! It hits different, it really shows that this song can be more powerful in this generation!!!
There couldn’t be a better time to re-release this song. This song is everything. It’s the message for life. ❤
the way yall unsee and erase unambiguously black women 😒 yet see and fetishize dark skin men is UGLY
Un hit atemporal
Acrítica a realidade de hoje em dia foi perfeita, explanou bem oq as crianças de hoje em dia estão vivendo, e trabalho bem no ponto certo. Parabéns!!!
❤❤❤
I really like your songs! They always make me cry ♥️... This song is so wonderful and I'm crying while listening to it 😭♥️
Not to be that person, the video made me tear up and everything cause really it's so true to todays society. But Christina has literally had plastic surgery to achieve whatever suited her idea of self perfection. Don't flag the average person for wanting to achieve that as well and struggling mentally because for the average person they simply cannot afford to make those changes and the damage reflects in their mental health declining. It's a thoughtful message, but from the wrong person it's just empty. Also I know this is mostly focusing on children and teens, and ofc their obsession with it is damaging in tragic ways, but this is really how the world has shaped itself and children are just taking that information in and applying their worth "accordingly" to themseves based on what they see. For anything to change our obsession with perfection has to change overall.
Bringing tears to my eyes... Still holds so much weight, even now.
This was powerful
I reflect and always love yourself for being who you are #beproud
The world needs more of this💕💕
Es mas hermoso el anterior porque toca todos los aspectos que el ser humano quiere obviar y esconder, a pesar q estan ahi;  la busca de la perfeccion termina por herir a los demas.
Pero hubiese estado de lo mejor que fuera con su voz actual.
Irónicamente una forma superficial de abordar el tema con este vídeo. La canción sigue siendo genial pero el vídeo no le hace justicia.
This song has always been beautiful for humanity. I sincerely thank Christina Aguilera for speaking about all this when nobody really did. We love you Xtina. ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
❤️❤️😇
Ojalá que pronto alcancemos la verdadera evolución mental y podamos ser hermosos y tan plenos tal cual somos...
Arrepiei
We thought we had it bad growing up in the 90's. These kids don't know reality from fiction. We thought we needed breast implants. They think they need lip fillers, Brazilian butt lifts, nose jobs, wigs, fake nails and lashes, fans and growing social media presence. It's a lot ... 🖤
❤
To the person reading this: We are all beautiful...no matter  what shaped, sized, color we are...❤️  Thank u Ms.Christina for this inspiring music,...one of your fave song ever since🙏😘
That was the first song of Christina Aguilera I heard in 2010 when I'm watched Glee, I remember crying when I seen the original video cause, like a gay fat kid, touched me very deeply. Since then, I turned a biggest fan of her and your job. Love you Xtina ❤🇧🇷
Well, that was creepy. But then, it is the season.
This video remind me TLC unprepretty, nice that Christina decide to make this version to make conscientious on the importance of the body positive
My heart , This is truly one song that brings me to tears. It has one of the most meaningful messages that everyone needs to hear
Que hermoso mensaje
Isn’t it sad we live in a generation where we live behind a screen
i love the diversity & representation 🫶🏻
Gratidão Cristina! Você tem um trabalho incrível e precisa ser compartilhado! ❤
TikTok
Not me here reminiscing.
To see kids play like that is so nostalgic
😭
This is beautiful. We may all look different, but that's what would make as special. When I was younger there where a lot of things I would like change to in myslef. Now I just want to be best version of me.
La mejor canción de todos los tiempos!❤️ Beautiful es un Himno!❤️ hermosa Canción y hermoso video!❤️👏🏻
Mds o final do clipe eu fiquei emocionado, as crianças saindo daquela prisão de padrões, o grito que eles dão no final da pra expressar tudo
Such an important song and remake
We need more music like this to come back
Thank You Christina...this video is Perfect and Much needed for our children. It was Nice to see them accept themselves then end up outside playing just as kids should be doing. Again, thanks so much for this video and for caring about our youth. May God Bless You 10 fold 🙏🏾.
Dios mío que hermosa canción
Que clipe lindo! 👏👏👏
This really needs to change :(
Clipe simples e forte.
O hino de milhões 🇧🇷
This song and the album <Stripped> was my only friend when I was a child victim of domestic violence... it taught me how to believe in myself and stronger. I do believe good music actually can save a life. Because this song and album saved my life. Christina, Thank you so much, for your music, your voice, your lyrics... everything.
this song makes me cry every time i listen to it. the message is beautiful🤍.
❤❤❤❤
🙌🙌
This message is something today's youth need to hear. Thank you for reaching out to each generation with your gift, Christina.
Nah ugly people are ugly 😹
The attack on women/girls’ bodies, obsession of plastic surgery for the “ideal body”, the idea of how men/boys are supposed to be in society, colorism, drugs, and mental health…..we really gotta bring up our next generation correctly ❤️
queen of saving lives
Caiu um olho na minha lágrima 😭
so beautiful
😭😭😭😭
This is so powerful!! 😭💓
👏👏👏👏
Que musica e que clipe lindo 😭
That's sooooo important. Thanks for it! 💜
Hermoso himno 💖💖 grande Queen 💖
I was 15 years old when this song came out  feeling insecure about my body image I wood play this song over and over again  the song really help me  now at 35 hearing this song again brings back tears . Thank you so much Christina ❤
this deserves million of views
Make social media illegal for minors
Yung thumbnail akala ko si May May hahahaha
LET THE CHILDREN BEING CHILDREN!!!!!!! beautiful video!
Everytime I hear this song I cry; of rage, of empowerment, of loneliness, of acceptance, i’m not so sure but this fills so much emotion on my being. Thank you Christina, no one would have sing this better than you.
Extremamente lindo o clipe e a música.
Hermoso muy actual
Wow wow wow !!! A queen will always remain a queen ! Thanks for spreading this important message Christina ❤️❤️❤️
Just reminisce the old video some days ago and now you post this, gold ❤️‍🔥
Excelente video y muy cierto y profundo mensaje 🙂✨👍🏻❤️🙏🏻🎶
this remake is very needed in the age of social media for the younger gen z
Bomb thank u for the kids (girls+++) looking at this ❤️❤️❤️ you're beautiful, and this shouldn't be ur biggest concern right now, you should be climbing up trees most of the time.
Christina, you are my idol and inspiration. Your songs did pull me up at times when I needed a hand. I thank you for making this music video reprise to raise awareness about the toxic side of social media, that it’s ok to feel better about how you look but never dwell into it like it’s the only power you have. Empathy and compassion are the real powers built-in in all of us. This music video saves lives. ❤
As a trans girl/woman, I identified so hard with the girl doing the puzzle and the markings on the girls faces for things the world would want them to change.  Very beautiful video, thank you for making this happen.
Thanks for everything! This song! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
it's impossible not to cry
Lindo!
Congratulations for new version of video 👏the idea is beautiful ❤️ Our world needs more love and compassion for one another💓
i will play this for my daughter and i pray it has the same impact on her as it did me 20 years ago
The queen
Diamond 💎 a song that will leave for the ages❤
increible.🥺😍
la niña colocandose relleno para tener mas busto, y es una situación tan normalizada en la preadolescencia
You are beautiful no matter what they say!!! Everyone should feel this way about others and themselves.  Full of beautiful mistakes.  Something always shines!
I don’t usually cry with songs but this thing got me balling my eyes out
Maravilloso 😍.
I was so young first time I watched. The message applied & still does. Epic New video.
That's so needed
PRECIOSA CANCIÓN.... PRECIOSA VERSIÓN
This song gets me every time, Iconic song!!! Love you Christina for remaking the song and video in a time when we all need to be reminded we’re all beautiful and we all matter. ❤❤❤❤
🥲🥲🥲 perfeita!!!
I am a 37 y/o guy. I remember how this song make me feel through my adolescence and how it help me to accept that I was gay.  I'm thinking about my nieces and nephews and I'm so ashamed that this os the culture that they will have to face. We need to change. We really need to.
Nós somos lindos, não importa o que digam, o que façam, você é lindo(a), eu sou linda, as palavras não vão nos derrubar <3
Thank you Christina for highlighting the tremendous pressures on children.  Thank you 💕
❤❤❤
This video sucked. The fact that it didn't include dark skin girls with afro hair kind of offended me and I'm not even as dark as a milk chocolate bar!!😡
Me encanta Cristina Aguilera desde hace años, pero esto es contradictorio ya que ella se hizo cirugías y botox etc Nosé porque pone justo eso en el vídeo Si alguien me explica gracias
Very poignant indeed. Would also love to see this done with other songs like Pave paradise put up a parking lot. 🤔
This video is deep and means more and is more relevant today than yrs ago. I love it
This song will forever resignate in my heart and mind. I've cried so many times listening to this song in the past and again today. There's so many celebrities who don't have the same agenda to help children and teens love themselves but instead prey on them because they need them in order to be popular, famous, and loved. You are indeed one of the great ones who actually cares for the future generations as more then a target market. Thank you so much for taking time and acknowledging the  influence you have over young people with a positive and uplifting message once again.
I love CA , the voice and all. This video is important. I just wish she didn't wear strap on lol
Amo essa
This was absolutely meaningful and so reality at the same time
WOW, this is one of my favorite song
Christina giving me tears and chills EVERY decade
My morning comes with this, I didn't know its remake
This is really heartwarming, great song and great music video with an important message :)
Already a classic! And one with a good message 🙏🏽
Cry
O vídeo só com criança bonita
I'm an ocean of tears.
wow! ❤
Hasn't Aguilera had like tons of plastic surgery?
Such a powerful beautiful song
This song will always be important to every generation
I disliked this video because I finished highschool with the 2003 version and has nothing to do with this version, for me they are completely different and the message beyond this version has nothing to do with the intended purpose of the original one. I appreciate Xtina but when you touch something sacred, even you are the creator of that, becomes defiled.
Wow that was powerful 👏 😢 crazy how the song still applies 20 years later. When will it ever change 😪 😔
this actually brought me to tears, thank u, u did it again. <3
I hope different can't make our hurt :') we're all beautiful
Ya 20 años y no importa cuántas veces la escuché, o el tiempo, siempre brota demasiados sentimientos...🤎

Amei amei amei
Oh My! The only thing I realize is that we and our kids do not need Social Medias, we all need social and physical connections. We need a safe and healthy environment to live. But the world is collapsing and we rather distract ourselves and our younger ones online.  I am completly speechless with this videoclip: the same issues about self image is portrayed here, but this time is worse, because we are constantly watching and being watched. Horribly "The Black Mirror"-sh like.....
❤❤❤
Hino
We're all transbeautiful 🥺
Wow a tale as true as time, beautifully remade. The media and it girls and boys brain wash us until we become our own worse enemies until we realize it is not a cookie cutter world and almost all will one day look inside the mirror, someone's, or something's eyes and truly see this life's beauty.
This message is so important to spread!!!
ARTE
It's a very sad thing... It's sad cause it's more important than ever. This song. I have desperate parents around, patients and also grandparents who don't know what to do with their kids. Thanks for putting the problems of social media in pictures! ❤️
todo depende de los padres
Me encantó este nuevo video. Todo muy cierto. La canción sigue siendo relevante ahora como lo fue hace 29 años 💚
te amo, eres una gran persona y tu musica refleja tu hermosa alma <3
This was Beautiful, pun intended. It's truly haunting to see how social media has affected our relationship with our bodies and thereby our mental health. I stopped using social media last year but still find myself on YouTube quite often. And I always note taking breaks because even as an adult, social media gets into your subconscious so you have to be careful about the content you consume. Thanks for giving us all some food for thought Christina. This was truly powerful!
Thank you Christina, for making us feel treasured. I heard this song way back in my teens, and now it’s time for our children to hear it ❤️.
Cry😢😢
I dont cry 😢😢😢
Xtina always  the best ! The most beautiful song  ever ! Thx for it!
We needed this ❤ thank you for bringing it back!!!
❤
The change can only come from within
❤️
This is still lovely as it was back when I was still little.
This song so deserved the Grammy
Eu adorei a mensagem desse novo clip, realmente precisamos ter mais aceitação com nossos corpos e tentar não se influenciar com o padrão que é imposto, não existe o corpo perfeito, devemos cuidar do nosso corpo por questões de saúde mesmo e não estética ou algo do tipo. Realmente as redes sociais não ajuda muito isso mas existem pessoas que já estão começando a mudar isso. Com relação a saúde mental também não devemos gastar nosso tempo todo nas redes, e deixar de viver a nossa vida real. Adorei que o clip mostra jovens pois um dia vão crescer e se a gente começar de agora transformar nossas mentes para lidar com o que é diferente e não deixar se influenciar por redes sociais e pessoas. Parabéns a Xtina que arrasou desde a época que lançou essa música e saber que depois de anos ainda tem um impacto tão grande essa música
20  years later, and stills makes me cry
if “working to heal the inner child” had a video this would be it
Wish Xtina had re recorded this and was in the video :).. but still an amazing song 20 years later and a message everyone needs to see / hear
So beautiful, uplifting, thank you
Loved the original video for this song and adore that ending with the bleeding mobile phone. 💔  However, I have to say that those big guys from the gym are often the best ones: consistent and caring. They are people with well-organized life and are genuinely gentle with others. I mean no one can go to the plastic surgeon and get such a beautiful muscular body in a week.  Why Fiona Jane Burgess choosed to picture that dude of color as a big scary screamer? Such a fail!
La imagen final,es MUY iconic
This song means so much to me and so does the video
Im crying.. i never thought i was beautiful and the internet  didnt help. I was on tumblr,instagram,and twitter etc which was filled with proana and pictures of self harm. I developed anorexia and hurt myself it became an addiction. I almost died. But im finally starting to love myself
Powerful.
Loved this. I came out at 16 in 2002 and remember the original video empowering all of us. Hopefully in another 20 years we will be a happier society
How stupid coming from someone who used bottox, cheeks fillers, lip fillers, jaw contouring, breasts implants...
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Such a beautifully heartbreaking video, it's sad on how true and accurate this really is. The original was moving but this one is truly incredible as someone who suffers with mental health and self confidence issues I want to say Thank You for showing everyone what it truly feels like. You are an angel.
What an amazing video for today's society
Poxa, pena que a Xtina não apareceu no clipe. Eu amo tanto essa música
Same version. Different video.
I think it would've been more powerful if Christina used herself as an example. Like her before and after her lip fillers etc
Beautiful
I am not crying, you are...
Still one of my favorite songs of hers besides fighter.
Melhor coisa a pessoa se sentir bem com o que é
Words do bring me down. Really hard to be confident 🤦🏿‍♂️
Would've been better if she rerecorded the song with a different arrangement.
🔥🔥🔥🔥 Thank you
Thank you for this amazing video, everyone involved. It is so special
Diva X-tina!! Letra linda e emocionante, mais atual impossível!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 Interprete maravilhosa ❤
This song is beautiful. We are all beautiful, stop listening to the standards that social media sets for you, because no matter how "perfect" you are, people will always try to bring you down and make you feel unworthy of self-love. 💔I am a teenager in my 3rd year of high school, and it is difficult. I always find myself comparing myself to other girls who are thinner than me. I was sick in middle school. I exercised all day and ate almost nothing. I stopped having my period for those entire 3 years. I was always cold, shaking, and irritated. This lasted for 3 years until I finally realized that every body is different. You do not need to change the way your body looks just because you want to please the eyes of strangers. I am much healthier now and happier. I allow myself to go out instead of restricting myself. It is a long journey to loving yourself, In fact, I still don't love myself completely. But im definitely not the same way as I used to be. Everyone has bad body image days and thats ok. That is normal. I wish everyone in the world would understand that everyone is different, bikini model bodies are unrealistic, and for men, huge muscles and shredded abs is also unrealistic. No girl or boy should feel less worthy just because they are different. You guys are beautiful and we can get through this together.❤❤
💩
20 years have passed since this inspiring and all so powerful anthem came out and its still relevant today!! A celebration of individuality, uniqueness and a celebration of one's true self.  "WE ARE BEAUTIFUL IN EVERY SINGLE WAY"
nossa que clipe poderoso, chorei mt e me vi muito aí
Touches my heart still the same as the original release.
This takes me back to my teenage years! 🎉
Wow.
uffffffffffffff incredible video! I love it!!!!! also i loved this song in my 2000's
Chorei no antigo e chorei no novo, é isso. Obrigado Christina <3
Ella está tocando puntos muy exactos de lo que ahora pasa en nuestra sociedad, felicidades.
puta crítica social foda
I just turned 21 this year, this song always gave me a tear. I remember singing this song before that I didn't mean, I sang the line " I am beautiful " and there's a tear im my eye because to be honest I don't feel beautiful enough because I'm not skinny enough, my skin aren't clear, I'm not white as I used to be when I was a kid, etc. I cried even more when the l heard the word "emptiness" because I tried so hard to fill my emptiness by spending to much at skincare that didn't work for me, just because what I saw in Media, I try not to eat that much in highschool days and I did get skinny but it's never enough for me, I don't feel satisfied ( I love kpop that time and I always want to get skinny because I got bullied for being a big girl in younger days and get more bullying in highschool because of my body and face), I try and try till I got sick. Also they made fun of my frizzy wavy to curly hair, instead of loving it I chemically straighten it since 6th grade till 11th grade, I almost didn't stop not until I got almost bald because of the damages it caused.   my 21 version of myself is happier now, I can sing this out loud than before, I'm not afraid to be judged by being curvy, I'm not afraid anymore if someone pointed out my acne and chicken pox scars, I don't care if someone call me dark because Im not so dark or too light , all colors are beautiful and told me my hair was ugly because it's not straight, because "I am beautiful in every single way" I have a tear on the corner of my eye while writing this, I'm happy that I am indeed beautiful even my imperfections, also I am "beautiful no matter what they say, words can't bring me down", I am the one who matters not what we saw in media who is "pretty","ideal", we all matter and we are important
Las niñas gritando. 💔
👑 X-Tina 👑 STiLL Beautiful. As is Everyone here today 🌹
😢❤
Una de las más importantes y relevantes canciones del siglo XXI (de lo que llevamos de siglo). Te dice: aprende a quererte tal y como eres. Algo tan sencillo, pero tan difícil, y tan importante a la vez.
Wow, this world NEED this video. Thank you.
obrigado Deus, por eu existir na mesma época em quê Christina Aguilera existe
As beautiful and powerful and meaningful as it was 20 years ago
😔😔🥰
Esta canción me acompaño en mi adolescencia y ahora de adulta me trae tantos recuerdos !!! Hoy miro hacia atrás y me siento feliz de lograr sobrellevar la adversidad que tenía en ese entonces 🙂
Eres arte Christina, apenas tuve oportunidad de ver el video desde que fue su lanzamiento y vuelvo a decir que tocaste lo más profundo de mí incluso aún más que hace 20 años 🥹 eso es lo que hace un verdadero artista con su arte, no me canso de decirlo: lo que haces es arte, ojalá todos los artistas y toda la música en general siguieran tu ejemplo, gracias por existir y hacer de este mundo un mundo mejor donde no importa lo que digan los demás, uno se tiene a uno mismo y con eso es suficiente.
I think it’s not only body issues caused by social media addiction, but a frightening removal from our natural state to staring at these screens for hours on end. I’m completely addicted to my iPhone although I know it’s terrible for my spirit and mind.
Yesyesyesyesyesyes❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
love the song but tbh the first video is so much more meaningful than this one 💯
Cómo cuando haces todo lo necesario por volver a tener un poco de audiencia. Esa canción es buena, pero ¿retomarla en 2022? Parece desesperación por tener nuevamente éxito 🙄
Thank you, you posted it at the right time
Like my daughter said, this is a wonderful concept, but for those of us who have been crippled by "you don't belong because" and always will, it takes a whole societal change for people to find true beauty. Mankind continues to show every day that will never happen. Still a beautiful idea though.
Bless you for this!!
Ummm.... where are the black and brown in this   🤔  and adults
Amazing
Thank you for this song Christina, it was always one of my favorite songs and will always be 💙💙
Que importante es que las nuevas generaciones se puedan sentir identificados con esta cancion
Wow
The purpose and intent of the message is deep. I appreciate this entire representation to help heal society from these unrealistic standards. Beginning to appreciate and love yourself and one another regardless.
Too late.
Yo me sentía terrible conmigo mismo en el 2002 y esta canción me levantó el animo hoy en día es un himno para mi y hasta se las pusé a mis alumnos de Ética como una canción que es muy importante a lo largo de la historia musical en el pop por el mensaje que lleva en ella 🥰
La mejor canción de Cristiana!!! Muy adelantada a lo que se venía… pero con este video entenderán estas próximas generaciones… un tema que me ayudó en momentos de oscuridad….
The message of this song is just as relevant now as it was 20 years ago. Probably moreso now in the wake of social media than back then. This song is still so powerful. Thank you for sharing it again.
GRACIAS POR HACER DE MI JUVENTUD ALGO TAN BELLO, ESTE DISCO ME MARCO TANTO, QUE HASTA LA FECHA NO PUEDO DEJAR DE SENTIR NOSTALGIA Y FELICIDAD.
Thank you for this Christina ❤
Is this a remastered version
Christina This is gonna make me cry
Let me tell you something Girls ! Some of those models aren’t even women.. it’s all smoke and mirrors & No one looks like that not even them.
Ella es gran contradictoria hace música para los que hemos sufrido bulling en apoyo !!! Pero todos los artistas hablan mal de lla por q es muy mamona y ella es bulleadora   que irnonia !!!
When you can't make a hit anymore so you start to recycleing songs😂
This is esp. resonating in 2022 cuz it reminds every one of us of so what have changed? Can children be as they are in this world with Tiktok?
the original video however remains a symbol❤️
This is just crazy thx Christina she cares us fr
Beauty is a great part of life. We must always remember its many forms besides what we see with our own two eyes.   The pursuit of looking good isn't wrong because we are animals and are driven by physical attraction. This simply must be balanced with other mental and spiritual goals. And always keep focus on what is within our control.
Not me weeping while watching this 😭😭😭
1000 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Wow 😮 was für ein krasses Video. Es sagt so viel über unsere Gesellschaft. Ich hatte die ganze Zeit Gänsehaust beim Zuschauen. Danke für diese Sensibiliesierung ❤️
OMG.. 🥺🥺🥺
This song made me cry so many tears in 2002 as i didnt like myself then thank you for making it ok for us to be beautiful in our own way
We thought it was bad in our day, but what our children see every single day is so much harder to live up to. We don’t need five different types of foundation or huge muscles.
Phenomenal!
U suffer not only when you are child. It touches u in your 20, your 30 or even 40. And Thats why I love this song so much❤
Si en el 2002 los freakys y los lgbt eran los enaltecidos por la necesidad de aceptación,  ahora en el 2022 los somos todos, se demuestra luego de 20 años que hasta el más normal de los hetero, tienen sus complejos y trastornos y estos son expuestos por la interacción con las redes sociales.
La canción simplemente Icónica y el video realmente beautiful, me puso los pelos de punta 🙌🙌
I always  hated my self when I was young I was bullied  so hard from family members because  I wasn't that much white as my brothers  and sister  I was taller than most of the girls  my nose was big but my lips wasn't  so much my neck is short and I'm fat and it gets worse when I was a teenager  it was the time for skinny barbies to shine as I grow up I couldn't  go out without  wearing  makeup  at all I hated my skin colour my everything  and every detail about  my  self  I had no confidence  I had no self esteem  or respect  I fell so in love with  the idea of being  in love but wonder will a person  stand my ugliness  to love me as I grew up I found him he saved me loves me the way I never loved  my self we have a beautiful  child now and everyone  think I'm beautiful  now it's my time to shine and trust me I don't  hold back
❤❤❤
The videoclip really represent Humans today, where social media take over, all use ring lights make record for theirself
20 years later and this song is still speaking the truth
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Shout out to Linda Perry for penning a song we will all be listening to until our final days.
Ok genial que vuelva a dar el mensaje de amor propio, te amo Christina pero faltó el beso, osea en 2002 me diste un vídeo donde literalmente era más atrevido ver cosas así y ahora no, aunque si fue genial ver de nuevo esta canción ✨
I am beautiful no matter what they say 😢
This generation is so screwed
Why am i crying?😫
I like the original tempo. Though of course, this is still a powerful n beautiful song.
One word: "beautiful"
Sehr sehr wichtiges, tolles Video. Unsere Kinder werden so geblendet. Zeigt ihnen ihre innere und äußere Schönheit
❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹me emocioné
A mí siempre me ha gustado este canción porque tiene mucho sentido pero, ¿por qué cantantes que cantan este tipo de canciones haciéndose valer como referentes para muchos niños y adolescentes luego son las primeras que operan de todo? Sino mirad cómo están todas las cantantes de la quinta de Christina Aguilera.
Caraca me arrepiei todo mané
They have turned into Zombies  It's a great clown show
🖤🖤🖤😢
Me encantó que adaptará el video del 2002 a lo actual
3:13 North Kardashian
Damn…this is the most BEAUTIFUL shit that I didn’t need today. Whew….🥹🥹
Strong song with such a powerful message.
El mensaje sería: devuélvanle la niñez a los niños.
... brought to you by the face of botox, fillers, implants and photoshop
me encanta esta canción me fuese gustado que escucharla en español sería espectacular y sufro de descriminación por ser gay de mi madre de las demás  personas y  de mi familia
I loved how this time Christina used kids for this vídeo.  Right now the ones that are most exposed on social media are kids and teen.  Without our parents supervision we tend to use a lot our social medias and we can't see a diference between reality and social media (becouse right now everything happends on the internet), so we want so bad to be as perfect as the people we saw on Instagram, Twitter, etc. Thinking that we HAVE TO if we want to be as relevant as them.  Thank You Christina for this song and everything. You showed reality back in 2002 and again 20 years later  ❤️
It’s a shame Christina herself went down the path of heavy plastic surgery, not accepting the come of age. Makes me think this is all to sell records. But still the message is true. Let’s just turn the phones off and go live
❤❤❤👏👏👏
❤️🤧❤️❤️❤️❤️
10/23/2022.. may GOD's peace be unto you and your family @KeithBeamonFB @FefeBeamonFB
Thank you for this incredibly deep video. It was fantastic originally but this is definitely a great take considering the times we have been going through with the Digital Age.
Maravilhosa, hoje, e em 2002!
YOU ARE WONDERFUL! ❤️
Ironic an ad for Yitty shapewear came on before this video.
What a beautiful way to change minds. I admire you for using your talent to influence positively in youngs ways and behaviours. Very accurate. Congrasts. Love u Chris
And cry again
Thank you Christina you made me cry and this song is even more relevant today. Happy 20th Anniversary and to all we're Beautiful! ✨
and she setting the example of not having surgery, ha ha
Damn. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻👏🏻🙌🏻👏🏻🙌🏻👏🏻🙌🏻👏🏻
I love the idea... but this is pretty ironic coming from you, Christina.... 🤨
Wooow me encantó entonces y me encantó ahora ❤
It was an emotional song in 2002 and it still is 20 years later.🫶
😭😭😭😭😭eu amo esse vídeo, obrigadooo Christina
The crazy things our kids worry about now to be “beautiful” has a different meaning😢we gotta do better
클쓰 뷰티풀...!
Lose the ads, Youtube.
Without the " Dont look at me begining 😢"
There is an incredible hypocrisy in that clip. Talking about mental health and eating disorders but there isn't a single overweight kid. Talking about beauty but with an incredible normativity... Why isn't there an one-handed or one-legged kid ? A bald kid ? One with missing teeth, protruding ears or an eye disorder ? It's incredibly easy to talk about beauty while ignoring all the children who really suffer from illnesses, birth deficiency, stress or generic imperfections and only showing thin young people. I get the mental health message, but why aren't children with physical sufferings represented ? They can't be beautiful or feel better about who they are ?
This song was so ahead of its time, that's why it can still resonate today.
God help our youth.    Once adult start accepting who they are. Love who God created you as. Our youth would be happy with who they are.   It starts with us. We are making it harder for them.  Love who you are. Your outside doesn't define you. You heart and soul does.    Peace Love & Happiness to all.
👏👏👏
very powerful. i used to watch the old video on repeat.. so beautiful. 💗  i miss the days before social media turned into the monster that it is today.. everyone wants to be the same.
Don't let this make you fell sorry for yourself, go to the gym and workout.
cristina sabe lo importante que es esta canción para el mundo. Gracias ❤
Every time I listen to this song it makes me think. It makes me reflect on how much society, mass media, and social media greatly influence people to look aesthetically beautiful in front of everyone, it makes me reflect on how much these people are based on superficiality and not on the internal feelings that that person has at that moment. I suffered from bullying for my physical appearance in high school, so much so that I attempted my first suicide for the constant body shaming of every day, to the point of not making myself aesthetically sure. After my coming out, I constant refusal in meetings because my body does not reflect their toxic aesthetic canons, so much so that I fell back into a state of depression such as losing faith in others. But in me I already know that one day, I will take back my revenge with my simplicity and humility, finding a guy who knows how to love me for who I am both psychologically and aesthetically. #borntobebrave
made me cry like the first time 🥺😭
Awesome job with your remake of the video.  Kids and some adults  these days are having a tough time because of advertising and other negative influences they see and here.  Everyone needs to listen to their own inner voice and get help when needed.
Superlike
20 years later this song still hits hard. Cried then and crying harder now that I have kids. This is so needed.
I got chills this song was, is and  would be amazing ❤. And the video? PLEASE is a masterpiece, social media is ruining lifes looking like perfect bodies and lifes. YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY❤️‍🩹
People in S. Korea won't understand this lol
Christina making so much more for society than Kardashians.
Thank you for this!! Truly, such changes affected many young people especially mental health.
This video is like a condensed black mirror episode I NEED to watch...
Lol, I liked the first one better.
❤🙏🏼🇧🇷
So true. How society and social media makes everyone think about themselves in such a dark light that we think we are not beautiful, that we not special BUT WE ALL ARE BEAUTIFUL no matter who, what, color, size, age, etc... we are beautiful. Thank you Christina for making this song and re-enhancing it to what today is like to what it should be.  Love is what we & the world 🌎 💙 ❤ need.
20 years later 💜 thank you again
If only the world and the youngest among us could really understand that. You really don't have to become someone else. But that's not what they see, right?
Thank god there was no "stunning" trans women in this video 🤣
maravilhosa ❤
Esta muy bonito la verdad , pero Christina tiene varios retoques estéticos 😂... En fin la hipotenusa...
Where's de "don't look at me" whisper at the beginning???!!!
The message of this song is so timeless. Thank you Christina for sharing this to us 20 years ago and we are celebrating the success of this song with you. May you never fail to inspire and empower young people with your music.
Literally gave me goosebumps. Thank you Christina ❤
Beautiful art. Tks god 4 your sing
Amazing video!!!
i suffered from Anorexia for 3 years and 2017 i almost died with the aftermath of it.. After breaking off from the beauty standards of modelling and pageantry i decided to persue other career for a healthier headspace.. Im glad i got thru it and i hope other people will too.. Love and light ❤️✨
I was crying and I didn't even know it. I wish I'd had you to sing to me when I was a teen. You are beautiful in every single way.
Most important video I’ve seen in ages!
When it first came out it made a huge impact in my life. I hope this new video helps get the message out to our young people, the future of our sad, cold world.
wow 2022 version hehe 😀
OK, I thought it was a new version with her current voice, but due to the message she's trying to spread I think it's good enough
Algun día tendremos un mundo donde podamos ser felices tal y como somos y no uno de estereotipos, espero que ese día no se tarde...
sen mental sağlıkçı mısın ? ? ve sen de estetik yok mu bu ne saçmalık ikiyüzlülük !!!!
Eu AMO ESSA MULHER!! ❤❤❤❤
Ever wondered that you try to be more pretty and pitch picture perfect, because you are surrounded by ugly, envy and want to be different knowing you are good and the others distgustingly bad at the inside in their actions, actually? Look for the evil, those that are truly good but enjoy honestly doing bad, ugly bad to the bad and often appear to be bad. They'll help you out, but be aware of the most bad that will pretend to be good to hurt you even more... #provos #cyberpunkcoltoure #jedi
Linda Perry wrote a beautiful song and Christina sang the hell out of it.
😔🥺
When this song first came out I thought (and still think) it was one of the most beautiful (pun intended) vocals I’ve ever heard and now watching her updated version, it moved me to tears…great music like this can be so powerful and moving and she should be applauded for using her voice, lyrics and production skills for the greater good.   As the parent of a daughter, the message hits home even more ❤️- TGD
🧡❤💚💙💜💛
I hope this works
24년전부터 내가 힘들때 늘 당신 노래를 들었어요 사랑해요♡
I am ugly so what?  I'n not a model or celebrity, I don't need to look like someone else
🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
These days are so sad, people criticize each other for how they look, not many people love their bodies, it's sad.
The voice still brilliant and more amazing 😍. I love you Christina 😙😘❤️. Your voice marks our hearts forever ❤️💕♾️💕
RFS Israel *.     Truth      Peace      Love.
Thank you for inspiring us again Christina ❤
Powerful!

Iconic song, from an iconic singer. Lovely vid with a beautiful and extremely important message. But unfortunately it seems miss Aguilera herself didn't think she was beautiful enough. Since 2002 she's had multiple treatments done with botox, (lip)fillers and very possibly actual plastic surgery. Looking at this video, I can't help but feeling it's hypocritical. What a pity!
im tearing up.. i really needed this thank u, xtina.
Beautiful as ever. ♥️
Ironic though that a powerful message from this music video was also shared through social media. I guess, it's really about how we process what we see on social media. It can make or break you.
Thank you thank you thank you!  Society is unbelievably cruel for children growing up these days. I hope it hits the charts again and gets a lot of exposure.
You are  a awesome human being🙏
Such a brilliant video - thank you for this. It’s much needed.
Oh my, this beautiful song helped me through my own rough puberty. Now my teenage children have an even harder time because of social media. Thank you Christina, thank you for this song and the new video <3
Love the video so much. I have the same issue which is accepting myself
Thank you my dear Christina. This was my go to song everytime i feel insecure during my 2002 highschool days... And now still is. The comfort, peace of mind and cozy feeling are still there.
A 20 year-old song got 1.5 million views in 3 days. Now - THAT - is power!
I love this video too 🥺🥺😭😭❤
Ok but its kinda ironic that Christina is delivering this message while she changed her whole appearance... Love her but still.
Her music never misses. Emotional, iconic.❤
My age bracket was the first section of Gen Z to deal with issues of this caliber. The body issues of myself and my friends are evident now, largely because when I was a tween we weren’t aware yet of the cultural impact. Glad that the effect social media has on us and our kids is finally getting recognition for the cancer it is on our society.
like an episode of black mirror😢
More relevant, still relevant, relevant. It was a powerfull message and still is. 💜
This is very timely and relevant, especially at these times where most people's basis of beauty are the likes and comments on social media. This song will always uplift and will never gets old!
100 points for Christina...
The scariest thing is that the main characters of this MV are children and teenagers. It is terrible that they are the ones who struggle with even more terrible problems than adults...
This song, the lyrics, always relateable with our lives, any conditions. Xtina is the best. ❤️
No matter how we look at it, thats simply the sad truth we live in today. Such a strong message one music video can bring.
This is just stupid. Christina also is setting the trend of plastic surgery to her young followers with all corrections she has had.  I just dont get it. Practice what you preach!
This really helps me passing through my anxiety. Thanks Xtina. Love you.
Powerful song and message. Ironic to be posting this, but life isn't online.  Put the phone away. Go outside and look around
Love it 🥰
After twenty years,  it sounds so then and so now. I am so proud of your enormous talent.
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Omg 20 years have passed and the message here is still relevant and actual
❤Amazing❤️
Its like “Pretty Hurts” by Beyonce❤
why does she focus on surgeries when she had done a lot of it. She is making it look like that surgeries/enchancements is something u should not do becoz its not a form of self love and acceptance. Lol I like Xtina but this mv is petty the OG is bettee
Still iconic song 🥺🥺🥺
Dieser Song ist schon immer einer meiner Lieblingslieder. Die Message ist so wichtig in 2002 und heute: presst euch nicht in eine Form. Leuchtet von innen heraus. Ihr seid schön, so, wie ihr seid. Diese verletzte und oberflächliche Welt braucht starke und selbstbewusste Kinder mehr denn je.
I had no social media in my youth at all. I am an avid internet user from the early '90's. And if I dig deep down in my memories and my soul I just can honestly say that I had a less troublesome childhood than I would have had if I was in my childhood now. Despite not having central heating, a shower in the house, waking up in cold winters with frozen flowers on the windows, wearing my brothers older pants when I grew up and having a TV with just 2 channels in black and white. It is so hard to be young on the mental side nowadays. And that mental side is far more important than anything else. Be kind and loving towards each other and listen to your soul, be proud and be you!
A problem without age. We are all suffering from wrong images. Young and old. Wrinkles seems to be unattractive, body's has to be tight, breasts and asses bigg, lips voluminious....all the kardashian images should be seeing as sad, not as an example! We r just fulling the wallets of those who promoting it and breaking our selfesteem ! Happiness starts inside, work there!!! You r beautiful as you are, don't become what you arent...love ❤
Omg i love this song she still sounds great
Thank you, Christina!
This was needed. This was necessary.
She's voice is stunning!!!:((<3No matter what we do!!!!
As a 13 Year old, i can safely say this video captures what my friends/classmates are doing.
Love this song. But I find it together with the video ironic because Christina Aguilera had lots of plastic surgeries, now she looks almost unrecognizable... She was beautiful and she's still beautiful nonetheless (and the song too)❤
Every time I hear her voice, it is "Beautiful" to hear! Besides she's so amazing at ballad songs!
Thank you, thank you, thank you. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Just as beautiful and powerful as 20 years ago. Respect.  Destroy what destroys you.
This need to change for real😔❤️
저 중2때 이노래 나왔어요ㅜ 정말너무 좋아했구 앨범사고  콘서트가고 난리도 아니었어요ㅜ 언니덕에 영어공부도 해서 지금은 강사로 잘 먹고 살고있어요♡ X-tina gave me hope and passion to being the better version of me. I'll always appreciate that and I'll be her fan forever♡- from Seoul-
I like the older one better.  To me this feels like it's sending only one  message but in the original it has multiple messages.
Estas son las canciones que no pasan de moda, hermoso video..
It's an oldie but still an amazingly appropiate one for the youth of today! Stay strong and true kids!!
@2:00 It's hard to finish this Hardcore Truthful Video.
Magnifique
❤️❤️❤️❤️
The children all playing outside in the end is what got me ❤️
See these goosebumps?
Es increíble el video ( y la canción obviamente es mi favorita 🤩)ya que muestra como los jóvenes y niños quieren saltar rápidamente a la  adultez  debió a las redes sociales y quieren verse Perfectos ( estándares de belleza irreales que solo se logran en el quirófano ) es importante vivir la fase de la niñez sanamente ❤ Eres perfecto sin importar los estupidos canones  de belleza irreales y que solo están creados para hacerte sentir mal contigo lo cual no debería de ser ya que eres un ser único e irrepetible y no habrá nadie como tú ! … por qué rayos quieres perder tus rasgos y lo que te hace único operándote para entrar a los canones  de “belleza “( sabiéndo que todos los que se hacen una operación o cirugía plástica acaban pareciéndose y viéndose todos igual que ABURRIDO ! Es mejor aceptarte y amar tu belleza natural ! ) , ámate con todo y todo se que no es fácil  ( yo igualmente tengo aveces una lucha interna de como debo de verme ) es momento de dejar de ver cosas que en vez de ayudarnos nos lastiman ( como por ejemplo seguir cuentas de influencers con cuerpos “ perfectos “ y vida “ perfecta “ ) deja de compararte y trabaja en ti ! , enfócate en ti ! . Tu eres BEAUTIFUL ! .❤
Me encantará por siempre
It's fresh. But can't compare to the original one :)
Started ❤️ went 💔 and now ❤️‍🩹 … this reminded me how beautiful i am  and to not let the bad seeds that were planted in me at a young age grow negative fruit or even taint the positive ones that were planted the first place. Thank you for this positive inspirational video/message. Even at the big old age of 28 i still have my insecurities and vanity issues, as well as struggles with who i am due to the constant attacks as kid growing up. I had to be physical with others to make them understand I’m not the one to play with but word’s definitely do effect a child’s development. I didn’t have a bad childhood thanks to my core friends an mothers love (r.i.p) but if i could go back an tell my younger self something… be free be who you want to be don’t let them scare u or talk down on what you like and who you like, your going to go through some of the hardest times but you will get through them cuz your a FIGHTER & MOST IMPORTANTLY YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL ❤️.   Dear parents & future parents, PLEASE PLANT THE SEEDS OF LOVE, ACCEPTANCE AND GRACE IN YOUR KIDS … CUZ EVENTUALLY THOSE SEEDS WILL IN TIME GROW AN YOU WILL SEE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL ❤ U CREATED WITH LOVE
It's been 20 years but still a gut punch. Perfect example of a song that can transcend time. Legend❤
This is part of why I deleted my Facebook account and Instagram app. A phone call, a zoom call or meet up is so much more fulfilling than sharing a fake version of ourselves through a platform designed to make us seek validation and attention.
Whats new
This is probably Christina's most influential song.
This song is a message of peace and acceptance,"GOD!" Bless everyone
PROTECT THE CHILDREN
I love that she included men in this
Such an important message, then and now. Beautiful job ❤️
But xtina, you got your fillers done too
That muscular dude, I want him to he my personal trainer 😅
IT IS SIMPLE! DONT LOOK TIKTOK INSTAGRAM YOUTUBE?INFLUENCERS? THEY URN MONY! MOST IS FAKE! CHIRURGIE! THEY UNSCURE! AND THINK?THEY NOW WATH BEAUTIFULL IS? GIVE YOY A FREE TIP!!! EVERY ONE IS BEAUTIFULL! BE INDIVUEL! AS WE IN THE 80! WE AL DID OURER OWN TAST CLOTHES ON! MIX IT MAKE OWN STYLE FIX TO OURER PERSONALITY! AND WE LOVE TO LIVE! LIFE IS TO SHORT?FOR BUSSY?12 HRS?AT DAY?ONLINE?STOP WITH THIS CHIT!
Christina doing it again ☆♡ True artist
thanks for bringing this back again
To speak my truth, I felt more of an emotional connection to the OG video. I felt this rendition only touched the several topics vs really trying to encapsulate the deep inner emotion that the OG video did to me. I'm kinda disappointed, but applaud at the effort and the intended message that the video is trying to capture. ❤️ Look forward to more remakes (hopefully).
WOW.
Excelente
thank you for this. I hope this will reach out to many.
Cant you bring me down today
Tudo haver com os tempos atuais... Triste realidade . Uma música atemporal .
Awesome tune after all these years. As woman we are beautiful and don't bring me down today. Women like myself beaten down physically and foul word calling. But I never let it get to me  Leave and run away from the abuse that's all.
Ojala pudiera hacer una versión en español que permita llegar a más este mensaje.
This hits me differently now. 😔
This song is still so relevant today.
This will never not be perfect. And the timing for this new version, 20 years later, was just as perfect.
Stream
Coincidencia o no, siento que la vida algo me quiere decir al que Christina haya sacado un nuevo video de esta legendaria canción. La primera versión salió cuando yo sólo tenía 12, años de inocencia y tiempos diferentes, ahora con 32 y años en que no hay día que no piense en el suicidio algo de señales me quiere decir, al igual que muchas personas que también pasan por lo mismo  que yo, que es dismorfia corporal, depresión y trastornos alimenticios.  Lo más probable es que me termine matando igual, esto me supera, sin embargo se agradecen algo de momentos de luz, y aunque a mí no me ayude del todo, ojalá que a otras personas sí.
This 2022 video brings me to tears every time. Thank you for the release of emotions and the healing.
She predicted how our phones would take over, and hurt so many people. Social media is a comfort and a curse. Thank you Christina ❤️🖤❤🖤
this is so important
I didn't understand. Why, instead of taking the 2002 recording, didn't you re-record a version with your updated vocals?
Nudo en la garganta 🥺❤️
Que cirúrgica essa canção e o momento em que estamos vivendo! Parabéns 👏🏻 👏🏻
This is important! Thank you for making this video, raising awareness and letting kids know that they are naturally beautiful and don't need to change themselves to fit into the trends and social standards. That they shouls be playing and having fun with friends, not worrying about how they look.
Rainha atemporal
(Don't look at me)  Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly, it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain, I'm so ashamed  I am beautiful, no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, no, no So don't you bring me down today  To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?  You are beautiful, no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, no, no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, no, no So don't you bring me down today  No matter what we do (no matter what we do) No matter what we say (no matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes (oh, yeah) And everywhere we go (and everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (sun will always, always) And tomorrow we might awake on the other side (shine)  'Cause we are beautiful, no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  Don't you bring me down today Don't you bring me down today
Salud Mental! ✌️💝 Gracias Xtina 🏳️‍🌈
This song perfectly would be the soundtrack of my life. CRYing in every single way
Lindo clipe
Forgot to include a shot of any Kardashian and the toxic images they promote. Oh yeah, xtina is buddy-buddy with them
Really fkng necessary. Thank you Christina, tu eres la reina ❤
The message of the song remains ever pressing. The absence of the messenger's [new] face however, is ironic.
Es hermosa la canción, pero el video lo encontré muy parecido a Unpretty de TLC 🤔
One of the best songs of all time!!! Thank you for being so real Xtina! We need more music and videos like these!
More timely than ever in the age of Social media
🥰
Great song, amazing lyrics and fantastic videoclip... Any doubt this is Christina Aguilera???? No!!! Congratulations 👏🏻👏🏻🤣
Wow, vine aquí porque sentía nostalgia por el 2000 y me encuentro con Beautiful versión 2022 Y si, tienes razón y estoy llorando como aquella vez
You are fucking beautiful 🫵🏼
😢💙 We’re no need to be the same as somebody. Thank you Christina. I love you Christina. I was saved by this song again and again.
La Voz de la Generación! Gracias Christina
Made me cry
So thankful I was growing up on this, TLC and Destiny’s child❤ Trust me, I love me🤙
It's still a divine jam only the muse Christina can bestow!
Maravilloso cómo el anterior! Actualizar la información para aquellos que aún no habían nacido es una buena señal para  los niños y jóvenes de hoy!
This song had credit befor her 'seriously concerning' change in her look. Now it's hypocrisy. I still like her, but who buys all the lies.
The lyric  of this song is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard.... always makes me cry.
This song saved my mental health and life as a teenager 20 years ago. Now as a mother, I am determined to make sure my child grows up in a world where she can see herself as beautiful, no matter what they say.
It was rousing from the start but by the end, when you see children playing outside simply having fun, that's when it hits you. Thank you Xtina, you are beautiful.
is this because britney called you fat?
Ma chérie sort des nouveaux sons lui de recycler🙄
Te amo Christina, Stripped was my only way of healing throw my though teenage years!
ОНА ТОЧТО ХИЩНИКА СМОТРЕЛА
Tengo que ir a ver la version 2002
This song is Very important to the human being
Essa música é muito importante para a humanidade
I feel this video is wrong.  People work their ass off for a good Body men and women both do . I know who Work very hard. Teach children to love their self But also Get up and Work out if you want to look better .
hermoso 🥹😭
Essa música me fez tão bem quando era adolescente. Amo demais
Wow....que fuerte el video. Siempre ame esta canción 🎶
Yay!
I remember finishing school, and because I was gay, I suffered a lot from the  bullying of the 2000s. The internet still wasn't so present in my life, so the attacks were direct. And this song helped me through those terrible days. On the street I put on my headphones and sang along with Christina Aguilera in my mind: ***"'Cause we are beautiful, no matter what they say  Yes, words won't bring us down, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down!!"***  And I keep thinking how much we've evolved and how much we've gone back in the last few years... We see that even today, with what happens on social networks and it's sad. That's why it's such a great song in these very confusing and dystopian days. Where those who suffer the most are children who keep comparing themselves all day long, wanting to be something they are not and missing the opportunity to have a real, original life full of beautiful memories.  It is always better to choose self-love, compassion and tolerance for others, and high acceptance. May the new generation not suffer like mine and the one before mine. Let's love each other, respect each other, we are unique.  That's why this song has such a powerful message!! It is important that everyone remembers this. I needed to hear this song today. Thank you Christina Aguilera, you made my day special.
Sliczna piosenka  jestem glücklich mit deine piosenka  pozdrawiam pawelberet und Borisblocksberg  die beste  kocham  i pozdrawiam
Como no recordar esta cancion es un clasico del pop❤
We all know what we are seeing and we are doing nothing about it so… Its how it is and it will be even worse…
I cant believe its been 20 yrs 😢  i feel so old!
20 años y su mensaje sigue tan fuerte!
Temazo eres la mejor 😘🇪🇸🙏💚
Man, I’m crying at the oil change place!!
I received this video today, but I already loved this song in the first version, unfortunately society paints something that we are not, in schools they should encourage from childhood to adolescence, in youth that we must love and accept ourselves as we are, regardless of color, origin, religion or sexuality, because I have been wearing glasses since I was 3 years old, I suffered a lot of prejudice and bullying, people only attacks us because they They were attacked first either inside the house, or on the street, today at 34 I wanted to pass it on to my Future children (as) not to fight back but to try to understand the reason for so much aggression, in the world needs to be preached ABOUT LOVE AND MUTUAL RESPECT
Esa niña que se pone unos implantes, es la hija de Kim Kardashian o estoy equivocada🤔🤔🤔
We need more songs like this; music that speaks to us, helps us and guides us. Well done to the songwriter, video director and of course, the amazing vocalist: Miss Aguilera! This song has got me feeling so nostalgic. ❤️
Hace 20 años me daba pena, ahora me da risa 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Sad but true!!!............. btw this is a timeless gem! 😍
Aguilera!! you are needed by the world.THANKS In 2016 I suffered a blow to life greater than anything I had been through, I went into an endless depression. I was too afraid to tell my parents "I'M GAY"...it consumed me inside. Today I am 100% me!I heard this song when I was hospitalized.changed my life TODAY I LOVE MYSELF I'M BEAUTIFUL.
TE AMO XTINA ♥
As if she didn’t have any plastic surgery herself
Amazing. Thank you Christina ❤
♥️🥹
OMG this video 👀👀👀  Indeed, we are beautifully and fearfully made in the image of Jesus Christ, who is Love!!! "Do not fear, only believe"; for Jesus has conquered Death and Hell for us; He is the blessed Hope who died for us in our place so that we may live through Him because HE YET LIVES!!!
Sólo tú puedes hacer "Magia" con tu voz y tus canciones! Esta canción me encantó cuando la escuché por primera vez,ahora me vuelve a encantar,y sobre todo por la intención con la que la vuelves a cantar, la de Ayudar! Dios te siga bendiciendo Christina,con tu preciosa voz,tus preciosas canciones, y tú sentido de ayuda por el mundo! Gracias! Ah, en la versión remix, leí que alguien comentó que esta canción en su primera versión evitó su primer "intento de suicidio" , Gracias Christina por hacerle bien al mundo!
Can’t believe it’s already 20 years ….
🙏🏾♥️
I never understood this song as a 5 year old but as a 25 year old wow it’s so relevant
Is incredible  .  Todos somos hermosos y no importa lo que otros digan ❤️❤️❤️ Queen Aguilera
Did she re record this song? Or is the only difference the video?
OmG I'm crying.. xtina never stop inspired me.. thank you for your new 'beautiful' mv and message from this. 🌺🌺🌺
Wow and 100 times Wow 👌 👏 😍
Xtina você merece o mundo
thank you mother X
I remember my head of year singing this in assembly with a mirror facing us 💗
Seeing the kids playing outside 🥲
Gracias Xtina, por recordarnos que somos HERMOSXS 🖤
Let kids be kids 💗
Here we are 20 yrs later and I’m crying again! Absolutely beautiful message and lyrics!
So. When this song first came out, I was 13. My phone was basically a Nokia brick and the most I did was play Snake. School was fine and life honestly seemed more simpler. Now I'm the mother of a (nearly) two year old girl and I do worry about how she'll cope as she gets older. There's just so much pressure, so much hate, not enough love and understanding. So I got goosebumps watching this ❤️
This is so beautiful! Thank you
Quando você  pensa que não tem como superar o vídeo de Beautiful 2002 Christina vem e mostra em 2022 que pode se superar sim 👏👏👏👏👏👑❤ Eu amo a primeira versão e amei essa segunda❤ Beautiful é um hino atemporal👏👏👏👏
De las mejores actualizaciones sin duda, tanto tiempo y sigue impactando con tanto poder esta maravilla.
era tan difícil cumplir “estereotipos” cuando salió esta canción, imagínate ahora en el 2022 con las redes sociales 😢😢😢 que espectacular Xtina, siempre se reinventa! Es magia!
Por estás cosas que haces, te amo Xtina!!! 😔❤️
Thank you! ❤
Great song, new vid don't compare to the old one
So relevant and so needed in this world
Recuerdo que conocí está canción cuando tenía 13 años (hace 10 años) y lloraba a diario por como me molestaban por mi físico y preferencias sexuales, incluso llegué a pensar en quitarme la vida . No sé que habría sido de mí de no haber visto el vídeo y la letra que me dio tanta fuerza de seguir adelante y armarme a mi mismo ❤️ De verdad esperó que algún chico que esté pasando por lo mismo pueda entender que es hermoso tal y como es y que los malos tiempos van a pasar y va a poder ser feliz .
I am not beautiful.
En la sociedad de mierda en la que nos estamos convirtiendo
Tan real!! Gracias por esta obra de arte
Its a great song and striking music video, in a good way. I cant help but feel a little uncomfortable tho becuase if you go look at Christina's IG and stuff it sadly looks exactly like some of the stuff in this video.
Well, I prefer the original video.. like so much more! This one.. not as impactful.. just.... plain!
In 4:41 min. wird zusammengefasst, wie kaputt die Menschheit ist. Ein Zeitloser Hit mit einer sehr traurigen Hintergrundgeschichte. Jedes Lebewesen ist einzigartig.
Omg!!! Love this!!! Let kids be kids!!!
What happened to lady marmalade xtina

What are the pills the young man is taking?
She can't hit those high notes anymore. it's a shame

As someone currently struggling with Body Dysmorphic Disorder and an ED, this video gave me a new perspective from what I have. Social media has messed up the beauty standard so much to a point that people, no matter the gender, are all struggling from this skewed standard. Adults. Teens. Kids, for goodness sakes. From extreme diets, to bbls, to muscle building, and many more, things are being taken to the extreme and forces the ideal that if you don’t have any of these, you are not worth anything. Thank you for bringing awareness to this situation because social media did make it worse for me. As a female, I already had these symptoms since high school, where being skinny was the standard. Now it’s all slim thick. I’m growing tired of it and I definitely don’t want any kid to go through what I am going through. It’s awful.
love it thanks for Christina <3 We are beautiful <3
IF YOU ARE WATCHING THIS RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL AS HECK BESTIE!! DONT LET ANYONE TELL YOU OTHERWISE! YOU SLAY THE DAY AWAY! WHATEVER OUTFIT YOURE WEARING, YOU LOOK AMAZING IN IT!
Damn... 20 years. Can't wait for the 40th anniversary
Emocionante! O vídeo original continuava atual e esse gerou mais uma reflexão sobre o mundo que vivemos atualmente!
both verisons are so powerful, thank you Christina. for then and now .
I absolutely love the music video! The way social medias influes in our lives is huge. And it's not always a great thing
Queen
Nao entendi ela relançar esse clássico de Stripped com esse clipe tão fraquinho. Se fosse pra relançar que tivessem um clipe melhor que o original. Porém, a cena final é ótima.
Esta canción es hermosa, icónica, eterna, clásica y atemporal ❤️
Estamos ante una canción atemporal. Pasarán los años y siempre estará vigente.
Thank you Christina. We're of a similar age and while we were probably both being made to feel hatred towards our bodies in different ways in the early 2000s, nobody would've guessed how bad it would be for our children's generation. Thank you for speaking out in your own way. I feel like throwing all the tech in the house away right now! ❤️ 🌳 🌲 🌴
WOW!  This song is so powerful. Powerful enough to change or even save lifes. God Bless You!! And thank You for sharing your amazing talent with all of us. 💓
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Wow 20 years later and still I got tears in my eyes... so deep. so deep in 2002 and now 2022.Thank you for reloaded your own song with a new Video!
We are beautiful, no matter what they say ☀️🤍☀️
Words can't bring me down.
So Grateful for this message to spread around the world again ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you Christina! You empowered people to be and love the way they are.
wooooooooowww!!!
I wish we could make this song a hit like it was 20 years ago... I don't know what that would take. Maybe putting the song on sale on itunes or back on the radio to spread the message. Everyone, especially children and teens, should hear it, but if it's just on YouTube they might not :(  Stripped has always been my favorite album. It's empowering. It sent a really big message to me. I'm not into the music today much, but when I'm listening to the top 40 stations in my city I don't hear anything like this. Even though the radio isn't the biggest thing anymore, I wish I still could hear something similar. I'm not planning on having children, but if I did, I'd play Stripped for them.
👏🏻👏🏻
What a powerful message!! We are beautiful 😊
I don't get tingles often, but the world needs this right now. Thank you
Where are the fat kids though?
Love this ❤
😢
Love you ❤but I’m gay 😂
Yeah, let children be children. Let people not lose their individuality. There is no perfect. Everyone in their own right is special and beautiful. Thank you, Christina for once again making people aware of their self worth that should never depend on people's judgement or on some standard  👍🏻
Beautiful In The Last 20 Years Since Stripped Was First Released Social Media Has Tra Research Suggef That Time Spent On Social This Needs Change For More Information And Res
Such a poignant video that raised all of the hairs on my body... I'm so glad you and the director focused on the impact of social media and technology on children. This isn't talked about enough and their potential damage is devastating... Thank you Christina for such a beautiful piece of art 💗
Great!!!!
The irony of social media is that much of it the opposite of “social”
I hoped to see Xtina :(
Кристина Агилера выпускает клип с заботой о ментальном здоровье и запрещает пользователям из России смотреть его. Оу, это наверное не в коем случае не буллинг 😂 Кристина у русских есть ВПН и теперь еще ненависть к твоему творчеству 😂👍 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
Don't look at me  Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed  I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today  To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?  You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today  No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes  And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side  'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
Christina aguilera me encanta más en su música en inglés es lo de ella 😍
Not everyone is beautiful and that's okay. We all have different strengths and weaknesses. Don't convince yourself you're physically attractive if you're not. Make yourself more attractive or value your true strengths. Lying to yourself isn't going to help.
💚
la mejor cancion que representa su " amor a la verdad" Christina,,,,, ya que la realidad de hoy en dia,,, la gente odia y rechaza e ignora la verdad,,, porque no soporta su luz,,,,solo los que tenenos luz interior amamos quienes realmente somos lejos de las ideologias toxicas de la television, el movil y los grupos hegemonicos toxicos que quieren comvertir a las nuevas generaciones de jovenes en los nuevos esclavos,,,, si no hay verdad en sus corazones,,,, habra mentiras artificiales en sus vidas,,,,

A video against social media posted on social media
💯👑❤
This video make me realize.. How today body shaming problem is even more horrible than years ago (when the single first out)
A beautiful song👍
❤❤❤
Yo sufrí anorexia y bulimia y esta canción me marcó muchísimo , Christina fue alguien importante en esos tiempos . Las redes sociales nos están jodiendo la salud mental, el querer ser como los demás y querer la aceptación de todos. Siempre nos quedará el amor propio, y eso es lo más importante y que le jodan al resto del mundo. ❤️
Get rid of social media its as simple as that
Wowwwwww this clip so emotional
Love this woman
I’m cryinfh
today is my birthday and seeing it was a big surprise. this song was so important to me when i was a teen, thank you Christina for all the times you gave me hope and strenght! ❤️❤️❤️
Christina, I am so proud to call you my role model. You have no idea how this song itself has gives people hopes and cleared out doubts we had about ourselves. You are literally, an angel. Thank you.
SO GOOD!
This newer version I believe is even more powerful than the original, especially with how we treat one another through and over the Internet as well as everyday life. 😞😳😠
It's so sad to see that this topic is more relevant than ever but I feel like Christina isn't the best role model in that case as her face clearly had many contacts with plastic surgeons ;) And to link people, that are searching for information or help, to her own page (where her music is advertised in the first place) instead of publish the links to mental health organizations at the end of the video...like WTF! I'm still a big fan but this feels somehow wrong...
That little girl considering breast augmentation is a spitting image of “Chilli” from TLC. 😳🫢
Why am I crying? We should face it, we fucked up with self-confidence!
These new vocals are fantastic
The song is timely and relevant. Timeless!!!
thats why i love you. you start a mission, make something unexpected and than... you touch everybodys soul ... its so important to to see...to realize...  there are 2 sides... social media... real life... f**ck of social media its not real.   you! and you! aaaand you! all of us are beautiful!!!   (hope my english is not as bad as it seems to me😅)
Wow so powerful 😭 we have to protect our kids from social media, and all the trash.
Guau me emocioné más que cuando la escuche hace 20 años. Gracias por volverla a sacarla a la luz. Es tan necesaria para la gente como yo que sufre de depresión y para recordar que el bullying no debe suceder. Todos somos bellos y diferentes. Y todos merecemos respeto ❤
The first one was more impactful but I get it.
☆Wake Up~JESUS THE KING will return‼🤍of men are cold in the last days 🖤turn now,for What is the deal if you gain the whole world but still lose your own soul 💉🧬💯☠God will judge the world.Repent‼just like in the days of Noah  .
I'm a 65 year old male and this video bought a tear to my eye and a lump to my throat, it really shows the truth about the pressure that the young are under from things like magazine images of supposedly "Beautiful" people and their classmates who are pretty on the outside but dark and horrible on the inside....Don't pay any attention to them just be yourself and you will be what they can Never be.. A truly Beautiful person 💖
I'm totally stagged. That song is actually twenty years old and it helped me find my way. Overweight, gay, depressions, the feeling being ugly and never as good as the others. And now BEAUTIFUL is touching my heart again like I was fifteen.  Today I work with people with mental illnesses and try to give them a place in life.  Thank you Christina for that important message you gave to all of us! Everyone is beautiful, no matter what they say!
Beauty is timeless just like this song. Glad that there is an updated MV for this current generation. This song doesn’t feel like a decade old song at all
Such a beautiful & meaningful song. I'm so glad Xtina has made another video for the younger generations.
Thank you for this timeless and universal masterpiece. It saved me and continuously saves me. And I love you for that.
The song is still beautiful but I would have loved to see Christina without make-up and plastic surgery at the end of the video.
No one will ever understand what being insecure or inferior of their defects are, except those who experience the same things on the same level. I get frustrated when I vent out about my flaws & my family treats me like this ungrateful creature of God. I AM grateful for being alive but I will always question why. But thanks Christina coz your whole Stripped album really reached out to me in so many ways. Been a fan of yours since then, til now.
Hermoso video igual que el que recuerdo de mi pubertad.
Best
Bravo!!!! This is what the world needs now!! Everyone of us is unique and so beautiful!! Social media is sh!t!!!
<3
This is simply one the most beautiful, raw songs I have ever heard till this day.
20 years ago, I still love this song when I was a child! When YouTube did not launch, it was shown on MTV!
We needed it 🧡
Thank you Christina ❤️
This is so sad😢
pinakamagandang song ito ni cristina ,, ang kantang ito ay napapanahon ngayon , ang message ng kanta nito para sakin ay maging totoo tayo sa ating sarili tanggapin natin na kahit ano pa man ang ichura natin wala tayong dapat ikatakot , maging masaya tayo kung ano man ang meron tayo sa ating pagkatao , yong iba kasi nagpapaganda dahil natatakot silang humarap sa mundo na  at tanggapin ang kanilang pagkatao
Alrighty, think that’s enough tears for today 😭 that was so so powerful, thank you ❤️ I hope the world can learn from what is happening and make a change for the better, and I’m so thankful you are addressing such an important issue!!
This song is so beautiful. The message delivered from the MV also.  Thank you Christina ❣️
Had me all the way up until the very end. Pretty sure there’s a better helping website than one that’s designed to sell stuff
wow.
papa franku's version is still better
God makes no mistakes. I am beautiful. You are beautiful. We are beautiful.
TEARS!!😍
What a beautiful and necessary video. Thank you for releasing this new version. I cried when I saw the children playing. We need to do better!
I wish she instead made a video for I Will Be....
Christina me salvo la vida con esta canción en mi adolescencia. Quisiera que más niños adolescentes y jóvenes tuvieran la posibilidad de escuchar y ver este video  también 🙄😔❤️
This song came out when I was a freshman in high school back in the early 2000’s when bullying ppl for being gay was completely socially acceptable, the original video to this song was the only mainstream representation I had as a baby gay, and the only representation I had ever seen of a transgendered person. We’ve come along way, but also clearly not in a good way
Such a great second version and so relevant to today’s time. I love what she did here so much.
yesssss very necessary

Beautiful than and beautiful now ! The only artist on this generation who actually cares about the new generation growing up with all these new “trending “ stealing our kids childhood with all this social media .
This song is and forever be Beautiful ❤️ with a beautiful message to everyone! Love your Christina xoxo
thank you.
It is an era of face!  We need to look Beautiful to stay alive.  Thank you Xtina!
This is amazing  thank you for another great video
Esta canción es tan icónica, lo fue y lo seguirá siendo por los siglos de los siglos.
Siempre lo dije ....20 años después sigo confirmando lo grande que fue STRIPPED...cada vez que lo escucho entero, siento lo grande que fue y es Aguilera. Y claramente es un tema re-inventado reflejando la sociedad que sigue en parte igual con los estereotipos.  Aplausos a esta artista 🎨 👏 👏 👏 👏 ❤ ❤
Still touching bae
1 million 🥰🥰
Amo esta canción, a muchos nos ayudó a entender que somos diferentes pero hermosos digan lo que digan otros de tí, lo importante es amarse uno y eso se refleja
Lastima que ella esta  siguiendo todos los estándares sociales actuales , cantando regueton cantando rancheras , haciendo todo lo posible para encajar 🥲
PERFECT
Singing too fast noob.
❤️❤️🧡
Todas esas personas que aparecen en el vídeo se ven tan hermosas e interesantes. Qué mundo nos dejaron a nosotros y qué mundo les estamos dejando a ellos? Me gustaría verlos crecer felices, que mí generación envejezca feliz. Se lo merecen porque son únicos, cada uno. Cuando está canción salió en mí temprana adolescencia  había muchos prejuicios, no era aceptable tener un cuerpo, cara y cabello como los de ahora, sanos y únicos. Qué bueno que todo esté cambiando de a poco.
Beautiful song 😍
CHOREI IGUAL QUANDO VI A PRIMEIRA VERSAO. INFELIZMENTE O MUDO TA DE CABEÇA PRA BAIXO. E INFELIZMENTE EU TBM ESTOU NESSA CORRIDA PELA BELEZA E PELO CORPO PERFEITO. MAS NA REALIDADE TEMOS Q ACEITAR COMO SOMOS
I'm so beautiful
Calidad de video 💯 lo amé
Atemporal! 😍
Seriously? How can she release such a critical video, and still post herself with full on make up on instagram? Isn't it like.... Against the message?
One of the most important and iconic songs in music history. A song that saves lives and helps pull people out of the despair and turmoil that they're in.
I remember how groundbreaking the original video was at the time.  At first I was quite shocked, but later on I realized how powerful the message was.  Still today, this song resonates with me.  This version of ‘Beautiful’ is definitely towards the Millennial generation, but the message of self-acceptance/love is the same.
Un clásico muy adelantado a su época y perfecto en estos tiempos
No pence que está canción 20 años después me volvería a sacar de nuevo una lágrima.
This song is so timeless, especially today
Sempre gostei dessa música...houve ocasiões em q me emocionei e um filme da minha vida passou em minha mente...
I DON'T believe a unhealthy, unstable person who sings onstage with strap on dildos is mentally fit to talk about what is beautiful, normal and what is not. Yes, if you are healthy, feel healthy and like what you are seeing in the mirror that is what matters. But throwing shade at those who have abs, who have results like being slim, fit, muscular is just wrong.  If you are a mom who is overweight because you used pregnancy as a reason to give little to no sex to your husband (that you judge all the time) and be overweight while throwing shade at fit healthy moms or intelligent childfree women who adopt instead, then you have a problem! It's ok to feel sexy when slim, muscular and fit. It's ok if you are overweight or skinny too as long as you don't judge others.
It's as easy as not giving your child a smart phone or tablet. Would be best if there was an age restriction, a law, on these types of things. It is a gateway to everything and steals their innocence. There is much to be said about social media and the internet, but simply if it effects your mental health in any way, delete it. Spend time doing things to build your confidence, self worth, and personal growth.
BRAVOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!! FINALLY !!!!! BRAVOOOOO CHRISTINA !!! I TOO REFUSE TO ACCEPT THIS IS EVOLUTION!!! BASTA
Love how the concept kids and teens' life should be the moment where we just enjoy the life, and not because pressured by the standard beauty, go outside and just enjoy being a kids
💟💟💟
I wish the influential celebrities would start deleting their social media explaining how toxic it all is.   Imagine if the kardashians could do that for society instead
Beautiful message to an already beautiful song. <3
Alessia Cara scars to your beautiful Christina Aguilera version
Social media are an huge problem for this world. They are causing individualism and  unreal expectations. Solution: ban social media. Twenty years ago the problem this song describes was already there. But in twenty years nothing changed, in fact it got worse. Social media are to blame for that.
O antigo é melhor 🤩
My heart 💔❤️
So deep but necessary!
Speechless timeless 👏 👏👏👏
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Thank you, I struggle so freaking hard with this, I fear I will never be lived or never be beautiful I wear a sweatshirt even if it’s 100 degrees out cause I’m worried people with make fun of me I never wear crop tops never! Thank you
Piel de gallina y emoción contenida en todo momento... Gran Christina!! Excelente voz y mensaje.En una sociedad tan hueca q vive a costa de las redes sociales. Hermoso video. Yo Tmb canto y te admiro desde siempre. Saludos desde Monterrey, México...
Goosebumps as usual 😭❤👏🏼💯 This is why you are a legend.
As a grandmother watching her grandchildren navigate a very difficult world, this song stands out as a sign that people are aware of their struggles, and there is hope.  Thank you!
hermoso mensaje XTINA 🥰😍🤩
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
1 millón.
Qué mensaje tan potente. Digno de admirar
This woman has been a part of my life since forever, it seems. I loved her when I first heard her sing, and I still love her now. Good job to her for doing this. ❣❣❣
Ese es el propósito de las redes,  reprogramar las mentes de las personas, meterles presión, causando ansiedad, depresión, angustia, por eso es mejor alejarse de las redes o saber usarlo con inteligencia
Beautiful 🤩
I just watched this and made me tear. Seeing the struggles our kids are going through in this  times is heartbreaking. My daughter being one of them. This song captures everything that we need for our youth. I loved this song then til now. So much meaning to it that we all should take in.
1 million views Queentina Legendtina!!!! 🖤
1 millón 🙌 esta canción se merece millones de reproducciones 🔝
Vamos por ese primer millón fighters 🔥
Esta canción me Mata cada vez que la escucho
The message is amazing. But why is it only kids that have the same body types.. if you want to include more about the body images and stuff please add different body types..
Come on guys let's get this to 3M views and 100k likes 😭💕
Thank you for this one. We need it; a voice that shines a light on this.
I did not give up potato chips and cookies to have you make me feel guilty....  I love my skinny jeans and I earned wearing them... okayyyyyyyy
It's a beautiful song but I'm getting sick and tired of chubby people commercializing off the guilt they feel for not eating a salad....
Beautiful song and inspiring for young women to let them know that they are beautiful inside as well as on the outside
🔝🤩
Perfect reflection of what’s happening with today. You just need to get on a bus at 3.30pm to see all the kids in their phones.
Xtina - we’re the same age. I have tweens, I teach tweens. This song reached me when I was 21, and guts me now at 41. I don’t know how we fix this. But I am going to watch this with my daughters, and hope as many kids watch this with their parents as possible.
I’m from Vogue’s interview 🇯🇵  I really like this song 🎧
Such a powerful video. Thank you for doing this.
As powerful now in 2022 as it was back in 2002! Thank you Christina!
la ameeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Mayoral hace amigos.
C'MOM 1 MILLION
The wall with all the pictures hit me hard. When I was a teenager, we use to be told to put up pictures of models on the walls, fridge or places like that to see our "goals" everyday. That was a digusting.
Why she make another video ??
❤
Money was gone???
Me atrevo a decir que esta canción fue  soporte para cientos de personas .. magnífica canción Christina, sigues inspirando a muchos más, aveces es tan difícil seguir pero seré fuerte cada día un poquito más 🙏 sin importar el que dirán ❤️
The most beautiful thing you can wear is a smile.  No matter your appearance or perception of how you think you look. Just think about it. No matter you age, no matter your gender, no matter your skin tone. Or what every variation you think of. A person with a smile is the most beautiful person in the world.
This video serves to question those people who allow kids to get hormones. I also hope this video will encourage others to stop wanting to change their bodies because society and gender identity convince them they were born in the wrong body. Surgery, lots of makeup, and well-learned routine manners will never change us to be something we are not, let's wake up, please!
Nice vídeo, but the original is unique
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Started crying when the first note was struck. This song was one of those songs that help light the way.  This song specifically was for my own image. If it wasn’t for this, I can honestly say, I would not be here typing this out.
This video made me cry it is so cruel what social media is doing in our lives, this has to stop!!
Мне очень понравилось ❤️
Very powerful.
If you look on the locations at snapchat on a Friday night Out you will be frightened of how sadly true this beauty standard has become - copied all over the world everybody looks like a filtercopy...   Thank you for the strong and beautiful message.. Again..🙏🌼🏵️
Magnifique 😍 🥹 le reflet de notre époque sur « la beauté »
Such a strong message these days maybe even more than ever ! 😔
Sings a women who is 41 and has no wrinkles and never shows herself without make up.
😍😍❤️
Child grooming really disgusting
I am 😢!!! This song still brings back the same feelings!  It’s devastating knowing that it’s only gotten 1000% worse in 20 years.  This has to stop SM has to change or go!
🤍Dios mio que poderosoO👏🤍🎨
Social media sucks in every way, at any age
Thanks for this ❤️
First video was better
que clipe necessário, que mensagem! chorei
Why she barely up the music video
I'm crying. It's so much powerfull and shocking than the first version.
I love this record so much. Such a great video and good msg. Love it love it
magistral sigue siendo por mucho una de las mejores letras que he escuchado en mi vida 😘
Not just children and Teens. Social Media also affects Adults. Made me cry because as an Adult I’m still dealing with body dysmorphia. This feeling doesn’t go away. Social media has definitely made these feelings worse. Not just kids and teens…Adults too. 😢
What a powerful message, Thank you Christina for shedding light on social media & how harmful it can be & unfortunately social media can be wonderful & it can be deadly with so many young children taking their own lives because of the awful things people say about 1 another. I don’t understand why people would be & are so cruel to anyone from age 1 to 101. The way people treat other people makes me so sad, on here I’ve had people say really mean things to me with my videos on my YouTube channel & there was no reason for people to be mean just because they can. Being made fun of, being told really nasty comments can lead to long term negative feelings & sometimes it’s so hurtful that sadly people take their own lives & that’s just heartbreaking 💔.
Starkes Video, tolle Message.
20 anos depois e tem alguém chorando...
This song is so necessary right now. It´s a timeless masterpiece
LOVE YOU AND LOVE THIS SONG
Please Lord let there be peace and understanding.
This gave me chills! 20 years ago and we  haven't learned from the past...still beautiful young people are being tricked into being someone else than there beautiful authentic self. I truely wish that for all our children, because they are the world and our future ❤
I adore this song. This video is right on! It is amazing! I love this message! Thank You! From one mommy to another!
This is heavy but it needed to be said and it could be said in a the most beautiful way and it is true to to gen z and the next gen
We are beatiful
Gayyyyyyyy
Xtina, I saw you in Dublin, full of Botox and butt implants, so what's this about. You don't preach what you say
The Rise of Pedophilia
Being You, Is Always Enough+ 1 Of The Greatest Songs.
We need this song even more now. Sad, but true ❤
Is the entire song recorded new, or is just the video new?
I’m already crying and it’s 10 seconds in
My mom just sent this to me after I was talking to her about my confidence being low a few days ago🥹
Excited with this my all time fave Icon Xtina and her Stripped Album. Is so amazing 💕😍 i used to sing this also in singing contest 🙏🥰
I'm not crying, you are 😢
Thank u for this video! Love u 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
que hermosa su  nuevas
wow 🤯
This feels really exploitative and phony after so much profit Christina made from her own body image, sexual nature, and use of social media on her part. She has contributed to the social issues she’s now condemning while inexplicably showing children as sexual objects in the video she‘a using to preach about? This just feels so inauthentic.
🥺
❤❤❤ BEAUTIFUL
F*CK SOCIAL MEDIA!
Debemos de aceptarnos como somos y no escuchar las críticas de personas que viven de una ilusión..
A timeless classic song rereleased with a cliché music video just to monetize with today’s issues. Her original mv is perfectly fine, but since she’s been flopping for over a decade she decides to release this to make a quick buck. What a shame!
Social media is a mental asylum
This video is a gift to everyone... thank you for this re-release Christina, it was absolutely beautiful!
Love this song!! 🙌🏼
thank you for you art. i admire you more and more... forever. YOU are pure art, xtina ♡
I will always be grateful for this amazing son.
It's true boys all about fitness from such a young age & girls to all about make up from such young age , I hope this powerful 2022 version also blows up
Wspaniała, Dziękuję za tę piosenkę w 2002 i Dzięki za nia w 2022, nadal jedna z najulubieńszych piosenek w moim kraju, pozdrowienia z Polski ❤
This is amazing
Totally agree with what this video shows. We are living despearte times where out children and teens want to live a life that it isn’t theirs. We need to pay attention to this alarming situation. X-Tina you scored a goal showing us this.
Timeless song, timeless message
Really. Just sing the same song twice!?
Yes! Chills and tears.❤
La paz que da escuchar ésta canción
Most Beautiful Song of the Century
THANK YOU, MARIA! <3
The visuals were created impeccably. However, there’s a problem with the messaging as Christina Aguilera herself had undergone cosmetic enhancements on her face 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Made me cry again - wonderful video and so important!! Thank you ❤️
The sad truth, gosh with thise mobiles.... life was simple then, but... buch more beautiful.
Essa música nunca deixa de ser atual.💕🇧🇷
So so sad what have become of us.
This song gives me chills.
Carlin
This song is more relevant than ever 🙏🏽
I have got to stop cutting onions while watching music videos. I live this message 💙
Love it
Please visit... what? Lmao
This updated 2022 video version should be mandatory for all of educators, teens and people out there.
You can take drugs, make radical physical features to present to everyone who sees you but biologically a woman (or girl) can Never truly be the opposite sex. It's really unfortunate you didn't have (pre-trans) more people to really express how much they loved you. In many cases you probably f'd their lives up too but certainly not to the extent you did your own and for nothing really other than a passing trend promoted by social stupidity sites like TikTok
🙈🙉🙊
Love you Xtina ❤
Tears of joy
Wow
Hermoso video
Great idea but why all the girls in this video are so skinny? You can look whatever if you are thin enough?....
Wow I did not see this coming! Very beautiful, again. ♥
It’s amazing, but I wish there was more plus size representation.
Some boring shit.
Estoy 😭, lloré la primera vez y ahora en 2022 , ahora tiene un profundo sentimiento por que soy madre y enseñar a mis hijos que se sientan seguros ante la sociedad es una ardua labor y más cuando día a día están siendo bombardeados con las falsos estereotipos que ahora quieren imponer…. Gracias por esto Cristina ❤eres la mejor …. Loviu❤
Me gustaría que una tal Britney viera el video y se alejara de sus redes por su salud mental, gracias xtina por tanto #20YearsOfStripped
I love this soooo much ❤ 20 years later this song still makes me cry!!
The Message is wonderful🥺🙊💕
I remember being a kid and being bullied for all kind of reasons and listening to this song, it made me feel so good when I sang "I an beautiful no matter what they say, words won't bring me down" it helped me realize that I was beautiful in my own way and that whatever mean things I was being said didn't matter, and that they were empty! This brought tears to my eyes, the video is so powerful ❤️
this cannot be stated often enough
If this MV and song can save 1 life. Job is done
진짜 팬이에요 사랑합니다!
Lo volviste a hacer🙏no por nada eres la voz de una generación 😍❤️we love You xtina 💖
Send show this my daughter great video about time something positive we cwn use teach out children in this crude world we live
Will she share all of her unreleased songs just like mariah carey? I hope she will. I'd like to hear her voices in stripped era
I'm not crying, you're crying. Seriously, I love this new video of beautiful. I have dealt with body image issues most of my life. And I have a Great Niece and three Great Nephews (and one on the way), and I do not want them to have to deal with body image issues growing up! Social media, teachers and/or parents/family members are either part of the solution or the problem.
I thought we were getting the stripped tour as well. Well this is definitely a lazy anniversary 🤷🏻‍♂️
That's what you get when you trust the mainstream 😈
Feeling this a lot rn
This song is so important. It is so sad that today people don't praise masterpieces like this song. Instead, they listen to shitty songs with shitty lyrics that don't have any meaning.
Watching the first video at 13 and watching this now at 33 is very surreal ✨
No puedo evitar emocionarme.. no puedo creer que hayan actualizado el video con el mismo mensaje. Es tan triste ver la realidad.
I love how the phone is bleeding at the end! And the quote with it! Powerful message! I have no social media. No Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, snapchat, none at all. For the past 2 years. Besides YouTube. And it's done wonders on my mental health and sanity.
Yeah.. timeless piece. Thank u, Christina. This song alone.. she should never hv to lift a finger again unless she wants too. True artist.
THIS is the music/message people need to hear in 2022!!! For those that missed it-- the message at the end of the video is probably the most important part -- SOCIAL MEDIA changed the way we look at ourselves and this evolved paradox of problems has fueled our addiction to compete in the most unhealthy ways.
Totally current, Xtina. Congratulations ❤️
😥😢
I thought this new version would be made with Xtina on the video and a new version of the song. I thought black and trans people would appear too. Well, it wasn't at all what I was expecting. It wasn't so amazing, but it has an important message though!
Solo les vengo a recordar que Christina fue súper déspota en su viaje a México, ella no nos veía tan “HERMOSOS”, solo es su mercadotecnia. 😏
Kinda contradicting yourself when you follow Kylie Jenner on instagram.
So she picks a bunch of good looking people for this video. What a pointless exercise.
🎉1M
This is so powerful!
Wow ✨
Oh my god! 💔😭😭😭😭😭😭 thanks Christina ❤️❤️❤️❤️
En 1 día no llegó al millón! Lamento por la voz de la generación que quiso reavivar su carrera muy tarde
Literally reduced me to tears
Excelente video .
2002 feels like yesterday 😩
2:59 what a powerful voice.
Poner gente con papada
Thank u Christina Aguilera ❤
This moved me to tears in the first 30 seconds 😢 Christina thank you for addressing this, your song is a timeless classic, so many new children are going to understand this message and my heart is so full from that 🙏 please keep inspiring the masses and THANK YOU for addressing MENTAL HEALTH in this chaotic world... you are beautiful!
Sad truth in vocals excellent!!!
As a grandmother watching her grandchildren navigate a very difficult world, this song stands out as a sign that people are aware of their struggles, and there is hope.  Thank you!
Absolutely Beautiful¹⁴³. Thank you, Christina Aguilera. 💐🙏🏽
Te amo Christina mi diosa
Im surprised she's not pushing some deviants and sex change 💩, shocked!
So true 💔
Horrific video...they are blatantly mocking and pushing the agenda with this abomination
Firstly, I love this song and the childhood memories it brings back of my mum singing the chorus to me when I was feeling down.   However, I found the video a bit problematic. Christina has altered so much of herself over the years and I don't expect that is easy for kids to see, coming from somebody who is telling them they have enough self worth and beauty as they are.  Not a huge diss, I just feel that maybe if she used her own face and story in the video she might be a bit more relatable to more people who are struggling with their appearance and identity.   Still got huge love for Christina and definitely not judging for the procedures she's had at all. Just commenting on the mixed message it may or may not give out to young people.
Xtina is an Icon
This song helped me when I was 12. It was always stuck in my head...
Beautiful !!!!!!! ❤
God I hate this narcissistic social media addicted generation. Parents who let children have smartphones before 18 are just stupid. They have no sense of the damage it does and children shouldn't have unbridled access to the internet.  What happen to just playing video games? Or watching TV? Now you have 8 year olds who are too dumb to play games so they watch others and they're addicted to 5 second videos and have no attention span for even a 20 minute cartoon.  Get your kids off the internet drug people, it's just as bad as feeding them physical drugs.
wow 🤩🙏🔝💪🫶🏻
Hermosa canción!!We're all beautiful
Hace 20 años que esta canción me hizo sentirme mejor conmigo misma. Y hoy lo volves hacer. Gracias! ¡Qué maravilloso video! 👏👏
Beautiful indeed. What a powerful song, it's effect makes a difference now, more than ever 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Definitely missed the mark here. Couldn’t capture the heart and soul of the original. Felt forced and inauthentic. I’ll stick with the original.
This video has dept and meaning to it, if you observe you will make it out
I love the fact that, in the scene where the kids are playing, all of them are dressed like kids!!!... That's how I remember my childhood. ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow! ❤
That's great but where are the fat kids?? The weightloss fads and pressure from online? Am speaking from experience.
I feel slightly disappointed it failed to to show children with disabilities and how thier having to cope too.   I can see the message of todays modern world and horrific cyber bullying. 😔
Chorei em 2002 e agora em 2022... X você foi e é a pessoa que me levantou quando cantou essa música. Te amo!
As a mom, I broke down in tears for our children...and more tears seeing the beauty of their innocence on display for the world (a message that is so needed).  Thank you for the music (I've always loved this song) and thank you for this poignant music video.
Oh☺I Like Kids
Finally a video made in 2022 with actual meaning and a good message. I miss artists like Christina who use to make videos like this all the time.
Beautiful song & video….truth is beautiful
I'm ugly and I'm proud
This is a much needed video. It's been needed for years now.  Thank you for this!! ❤️❤️
I’ve just cried off my makeup seeing this video
This is one of the greatest and strongest songs in the world that can make us feel better with our selves, from it's first note to the last word of the lyrics, pulling back the peices of who you really are and  finally found the beauty that you always have but you never seen before.
Love this! Well done, Queen! 😭🌹🌈
I love you ❤
beautifully reconstructed, bien hecho la directora y Christa
So many great singers cover this song with their crazy riff n run n high note.  But no one can touch how Christina Aguilera tell the story and touch so many souls.  And that one n only special tones that make us fighters fall in love.  Shes the bestest singer in the world.  I'm sorry no comparison.  I'm busy. Bye!
Comme j'ai toujours dit 20 ans après c'est toujours un signe
Christina is seriously criticizing the beauty industry when she herself has had major cosmetic surgery??? 🤔
Impossible not to cry, for me at least lol
It gave me chills 😭😭😭
Hino temporal meus amores, cadê os br, eu vivi pra ver isso 😍
This song will never get old ❤beautiful new video, just as powerful as the original.
She's 100% right, not only that children are exposed to this toxic social media and it's changing their behaviour and the way they are, this definitely needs to change all over the world! ❤️❤️ Thanks Christina Aguilera for speaking up! 🥰🥰
One of my all time favourite albums. Beautiful got me through some dark times and lifted my spirit. Thank you for releasing this powerful song to a new generation without doubt your words will inspire and influence many young people to be comfortable 🙏 with who they are and just think how  Beautiful  they really are ✨ ♥
This song came out when I was 12 now I’m 32 🥲
Beautiful still sounding as beautiful as ever in 2022 🖤❤️
I would always listen to this song and album when I was younger. Very powerful message for this generation.
so sad, I can't believe the young suffer so much from skin deep issues. just be yourselfes. true happiness come from inside.     your exterior is not critical to your  satisfaction.    not everyone can be a model. that's ok. strive fore what makes you happy. what others think of you is not for you to  waste time on.  be you. it will always work. be brave,  don't waste time looking for approval. it could take lifetimes.
Beautiful. Again ❤
Maravilhosa . Falar de Christina Aguilera  é falar de aceitação,  amor , talento ,dom  Ouvi pela primeira vez em casa com album strriper🏡 desde então me apaixonei por ela , pela pessao incrível que é . Vc é sucesso no 🇧🇷 Te amo xtina .
This is a truly anthem of the LGBTQ ❤️❤️
Wow what a song it makes my ❤️😘 so happy god bless as lol the people that are going thru something remember you are bueatiful on every way I love you
That's another beautiful statement nothing will change.
The last sequence reminded me of what Ms. Mel Robbins said that we should stop using the 'mental health" phrase. I agree. It is all about a distorted vision of yourself. Something like a Picasso painting. This simile is for the purpose of explaining what happens in the mind. It is not UNHEALTHY. It is simply messy or dysregulated. The pieces of the puzzle are not in their right place and that doesn't imply sickness or unhealthy. Look for Drs Huberman`s and Caroline Leafe's podcasts. Definitely, you will understand my drift.
GILA KEREN 👏🏻
Esta canción siempre me llega al alma. Gracias Cristina
999999999999👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
This version of the MV isn't really clear by itself. I don't understand most of the situations here 🤔
Still true. Thank you 😍
Yes❤
I love the song and its message to this day it's still amazing song. I still remember this from my youth and it being on the radio. However the video to me is bad because it essentially has what is considered beautiful people to me. Yes there is diversity but no real diversity body shape and body type or people not "beautiful" enough to be considered for representation.
20 years later the song is more relevant than ever... thank you for inspiring us.
no it's not possible...I came up with this song right now, I search for it and find the version 2022, uploaded two days ago ... life ...
Trans ideology pushes surgery & pills on confused young LGBs, kids with autism or mental health issues. Homophobic society transing the gay away. Puberty blockers & cross sex hormones aren't reversible, surgeries create terrible health problems but make billions of dollars. 😔
Just got worse. So happy I am not taking apart of it. I don't have any social media account and I am so happy and free.. I wish the same for everyone else. I really do just leave it. It's not real.  Please, do it for your soul..
We are beautiful in every single way❤️❤️❤️
What are we doing to ourselves
old version is still better. Nevertheless, this version's target audience are children and the message's really good.
Amazing production *chef's kiss*
Inspiration
Beautiful! Children really are growing up too fast! The world is hard!
This has always been one of my favorite songs! This new message is something I hope every single child see's and feels in their soul. This message is much needed and as a mother of 2 teen daughter's I thank you for this 💖
OMG my queen
Oh my God. This is so, so powerful. I'm a middle aged woman crying my eyes out. We are raising children in a toxic world. Videos like this are part of the fight against it. Thank you Christina. ❤
Such a powerful song, 20 years still going strong
😥
Still living it
dont get me worng , im a huge fans of xtina, but all these celebrity tell everyone love their own body while spending huge money on plastic surgeries , and create the body images that normal people hard to achieve, then lie to public they didnt done any surgeries, dont you think this is hypocrisy ?  dont they think they are the part of it that cause these problem?
Those are the years I want to remember and re-live. The age of innocence, where you loved everyone, and all played together. This 2022 version made me cry and worry about future generations💔
Lovely!!!
disabled people missing in the video what's a  pity
Loved hearing this song again! Would have been nice to see a bit more diversity in age for the vid- though I totally get that this vid is in response to the pressure put on kids via social media’s limited and dare I say dangerous representation of beauty. Bravo!
Let children be children
Love the ending. Let them children play
I hope you take note of this video xtina. You don't need lip filler. You look better before the fillers
This generation needs this song more than ever
Walk away deserves an official video
Stripped is her best album
Gracias Xtina
Never has the problem about self insecurity been amplified all because of social media. All the more reason why songs like this need to exist and be listened to, especially among teens and preteens. So it’s nice that Christina decided to revive(?) it, as I think it was released way ahead of its time or too early.
The bleeding phone WOW so powerful.amazing how accurate this is.social media is toxic
💓✌️👁️👁️
20 tahun yang panjang, words can murder someone, please berkata yang bijak
If Christina was fat and ugly she would have not been famous, despite her great voice. Society plays with kids' minds and sends shallow people telling them it's ok. Just keep consuming what we advertise to you. YouTube is no exception.
the song just began few seconds and i liked it 👍👍
Beautiful lady, beautiful voice,beautiful video
Sanctimonious bollox.
This 70 year old man bawled like a baby watching this.  I wish someone had gotten this message to me 55 years ago.
This song deeply impacted me in college and this new version of the video is so deeply impactful again. Tears. Thank you Christina for bringing awareness to such an important issue. May we take this message to heart in raising up this next generation. ❤
Tum logon  nay charsi banaya h
Soy modeló buscando chamba
Diosa 🙌🏽 Aguilera! Beautiful es impactante, reconfortante aun después de 20 años! Y este video wooo me sorprendió mucho es sublimes! #Aguilera #Beautiful #Xtina #stripped ❤❤❤❤❤
me quedo con la version original!
Xtina, you're so beautiful, your voice is so powerful, you matter. 👏👏👏🥺😻💖🎶
Really beautiful! Social media is not real life, stop compare your life to other and then compare to the younger version of your self!
Where's Xtina?
Gorgeous💙
Beautiful as always. Did she resing this version too?
❤️❤️❤️
This is more relevant today with everyone hurling hurtful words at each other
💖❤️
I’m waiting for your cover version of Whitney Houston’s hits and a Christmas album in Spanish.
Some Songs are important, "Beautiful" is one of them.
Beautiful message!
My song whenever i feel down and out.
Bischen Heuchlerisch von Christina Aguilera. Von natürlicher Schönheit singen aber selber sich entstellt mit Schönheits OPs. Wein predigen aber Wasser saufen.
This video is spot on!
Brilliant. About time someone famous had the guts to really show what all this social media hyper obsession and delusional fantasy is doing to society and to young children especially - its killing their spirits and souls. Big up Christina 🙏
Thank you 🖤
Awesome song, awesome talent. Good new video version. Still think 2002 version was more powerful.
this song doesn't mean anything to me coming from a woman who has altered her "beautiful" face
20 years later this song still hits hard with it words ! Thank u Christina 😢❤
So beautiful. So meaningful. Spot on! Thanks for the re-do!
Stream
Esta canción merece todo el éxito del mundo, nos a cambiado y salvado la vida a muchos! No importa tu sexualidad, color de piel o religión, es un himno para todos. Gracias Christina por haberme cambiado la vida, te amo! ❤️
Esta canción la amo pasa el tiempo y sigue vigente
Happy Mental Health ❣️
The idea is So right, getting there is taking time for me. Worse yet I'm maybe too old, but I'll try.
There's more to life than then just your looks people 🤦‍♂️
❤❤❤❤
Toxic social media
This should be played first thing to anyone who installs TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat.
The gay community is trying to take this for themselves though we all deal with these issues. Interesting...
Soy de los que piensa que se debe mantener a los niños lo más lejos posible de las redes sociales. Gracias Christina Aguilera por recordarnos 20 años despues que aún somos hermosos sin importar lo que digan los demás
I've been listening to this song for 7 years, and still trying my hardest to fully believe the core message, it's a journey, I hope someday I'll get there.
❤❤❤❤❤
What our country does to its children is disgusting. We should be ashamed of ourselves
The video is good but it much better if XTINA is part of it just like the original...
😭😭😭
Literal chills
WE ARE BEAUTIFUL NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY! 🥰
This Song is today more important than ever. Thank you!
_With age comes wisdom_  People will talk bad about you if you are: Tall or short, skinny or fat Rich or poor Smart or not... God or no God Pretty/handsome or not Well dressed or not You get the picture. No matter what, people will say something negative, mean or ugly You just don't have to think the way they do. Thoughts are powerful. ♥️
Regulate social media
God created us and we are all beautiful‼︎
so apt, so brave, thank you, finally once again a culturally enriching contribution, chapó! 👍🍀
Don't look at me Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is? You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side 'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
haha social media rekt 1994+
Jesus said in > (John 10:10 > The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.)  (John 14:6 > Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.)  (Romans 10:9-10 > [9]-that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. [10]-For with the heart one believes to righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made to salvation.)  So even if you have walked away from God, for whatever reason, that is between you and Him, but I'm telling you now that He > (Jesus) has never left you! He loves you and has been there awaiting your return.  (Luke 15:1-7 > "Parable of the Lost Sheep", Luke 15:8-10 > "Parable of the Lost Coin", Luke 15:11-32 > "Parable of the Lost Son")  (2 Peter 3:9 > The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.)  Jesus will welcome you with open arms. Amen!

Stripped : The greatest album ❤️
things need to change..    we aren't using technology towards great things.      xtina- best msg from a music video in a really, really long time.     this is a truly magnificent piece of art!    xoxo
Extraño tanto la Era de Stripped, el álbum más poderoso y maravilloso de Xtina ❤️sería extraordinario un álbum que siga está hermosa temática
Por favor Christina Aguilera ven a Chile! 🇨🇱 Llevo años esperando!
Thank you Christina Aguilera
Eres hermosa no importa lo que digan 🙌🙌🙌🙌 Tu música es mi terapia! Que gran mensaje, el celular nos volvió esclavos de un mundo irreal.
" #Beautiful 2002 Version" is the Better n The BEST

Hermosa canción ❤
NEVER EVER GET OLD!! My forever anthem to makes me stronger. Thanks xtina
You're beautiful no matter what they say ♥️ Love u Xtina 😍😍
Yesssssss and remember  we are beautiful
I LOVE THIS MESSAGE! Just let kids be kids. No surgeries. No hero worshiping. I love this.  Although that boy needs to get back in that gym and hit them weights.
Did she rerecord the vocals?
Wow!!! Thank you for doing this in 2022, very well needed for this new generation ❤
That was so sweet 🥹 and very impressive 👍, Christina! Your song 🎶 changed my life forever ♾! I’m so grateful 🥹 4 your existence and 4 sharing your art 🖼 with me and my family! Thank you so much 😊! Well Done 👍!
We are beautiful and this video is beautiful ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
So the message is, get off social media.
OMG I LOVE U!!! THANK U FOR STRIPPED 2022!!! THE BEST FUCKING ALBUM
Parece que ouvi pela primeira vez
Thank you so much for this. I really needed it today  <3
Just Amazing😢😢😢😢😢This song never get old❤❤❤❤❤
nothing has changed... 20 years later we are still beautiful no matter what they say
🍑🔥🍑🔥🍑🔥
An amazing song, talented artist...but Aguilera a transgendered FREAK
36 em alta
I think this is such a powerful video, I hope people got the message <3
dann zeig uns das mal ..  beim nächsten event ungeschminkt^^;)
😭😭😭😭😭
The adults have miserably failed this next generation of kids! 😢
Como llore hace 20 años con sta musica. Que me ayudo en su momento... y ahora ayudara a las nuevas generaciones. 😘😘😘😘
Abrazo virtual para ti
Incrível
I’m sick. This is SO powerful. Well done Christina.
Incredible
POWERFUL, IMPACTFUL... BEAUTIFUL! It was absolutely beautiful, very MEANINGFUL and transformative then, and so IT IS NOW!... MUCH NEEDED.  BRAVO!👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Masterpiece 🖤
Such a classic!
Voz y letra Música de verdad
Just as powerful today as it was when you first released it. Your album helped me in Tough times
I was 16 years old when I heard my favorite pop singer Christina Aguilera sing with her alien lungs lines like, "NO MATTER WHAT OTHERS SAY", "YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL IN EVERY WAY". And in the clip, different bodies, races, gender and sexuality, all placed "in the same box", that is, #IGUAIS! It was ravishing for me. I had never seen anything like it before. And that "KISS" between two equals, in slow motion, with tongue and everything 😱🤩😅, Lol... My goodness... Playing on open TV (Thanks #Mtv 🙌🏼, because there was no YouTube in Brazil🇧🇷 in 2002 ). Only today did the #REPRESENTATIVIDE chip fall you know?! I think it was the first time I stopped feeling a little less "dark". Because I always felt #different, wrong. And being different could also be #beautiful, or simply, just BE! And those words (thank you #LindaPerry 🙏🏼) would echo in my mind and soul for the rest of my life. Even recently, she (the music) helped me, as never, when I went through a #UNHAPPY episode of homophobia. She made me want to reaffirm even more WHAT I AM🏳️‍🌈. Because..."NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY" !! And this message is still NECESSARY!
I lovet song and vídeo!!! We love you Xtina ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Fuiste, sos y serás gigante, Christina.
one of the best visual script. 💌
una triste realidad
I get helping people not be obsessed with body image, but why tell them not to have ambition? It’s okay to be jacked if you want to be, and it’s okay to change something your not happy with.   As far as the woke gay stuff, that’s just wrong. Don’t promote that under any circumstances. But as for the rest, give people ambition, not resignation.
Would have been nice for new vocals for the new video but ok
No era necesario jajaja I'm beautiful inclusivo x mil generando odio por querer tener un cuerpo atlético, por hacerse una cirugía y verse mejor, el chico que quiere ser trans... Déjate de joder
Liberal 🤡 - real birth cert name
God bless Linda Perry
Where was the black girl by the vending machines -- why didn't they show her in the end?
Grandiosa a mensagem e os artistas por trás deste trabalho. Esse álbum inteiro já estava a frente do seu tempo.
Mentiraaaaaa
Is the message “words can’t bring me down” still applicable in the Twitter social media era? Aren’t words literal violence now? Always loved the song and CA a legend but the message seems disingenuous when considering how things are today.
Mr potato head melanie martinez 🥺💓
22 en tendencias chile 🇨🇱❤️te amamos reina
Such a powerful message before and after. Many people don't understand it and try to avoid the fact that children are more vulnerable now since they have easy access to social media.
Psychiatry is a scam and an evil cult
so sad
❤
Wow! ❤❤❤
you ILLUMANTI PUPPET smh video exposing how their brainwashing people to worship technology and the black Mirror portal inter—-net …. But work them
What a beautiful tribute to one of Christina’s best songs after 20 years. But, more importantly what a powerful message to today’s generation. It is a timeless song with a strong message.
This is so good😢😢 i hope the children of the future can live a life without people who want to change them ❤ kids are beautiful❤
Meeeeh
Maravilhoso
کیرم تو کوس همشون
Wrong
👏👏👏👏👏👏
el video original es arte. esto es un espanto.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
🤩🤩🤩
I remember being 16 when this song came out and it's still as relevant now as it was then ♡
20 years ago this song and the music video mean so much to me and now this new video hit like it was yesterday. Thank you so much for this song. I love you Queen Xtina!❤️🙌🏼
esperaba una versión nueva. o sea con algunos arreglos nuevos con la voz madura de Xtina. pero igual me gusto. Es una gran canción,
BEAUTIFUL 💜 20 years later & still hits the heart the same. XTINA you are Beautiful & I thank you for being a light in my life; I'm OK 💪🏾🧠💋
ok this hit home really really hard, this video needs to be shown in schools/ at children homes so parents can see/understand
Hermosa canción que 20 años después sigue vigente y mostrando a las nuevas generaciones lo hermoso q es ser uno mismo y aceptarse como somos . Hermosa adaptación!!
hits even harder today
Excelente video, triste realidad que vivimos por las redes sociales. Espero estemos a tiempo de reflexionar antes de que todo sea tarde.
😞😢💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Kardashians aint gonna like this lmao
I'm so heartbroken for these kids that see these images every day and feel they need to replicate them.
Gracias Christina x cambiar mi vida para bien, gracias por hacer que me acepte como soy 😢
Me emocione! Gracias ❤❤
Cringe
Nous somme belle. Nosotros estamos bellos. We are beautiful. Watachi tach wa kawaii desu ne... keep love flowing. Love yourself if you have a pulse. We are all connected roots. Stardust. The remains of laughter. The promise of hope.
This song is even more relevant today than it was 20 years ago. Probably the most important and powerful song by Christina 🙏👑
speak English in the comments
Timeless
I wish there were more plus size people in this video.
Would have loved to hear new vocals, too
hermoso video. hoy sigue pasando lo mismo. excelente adaptación a este año
Beautiful!
Every single one of us is beautiful!!!! NEVER FORGET THAT. HOLD THAT HEAD UP AND BE PROUD OF WHO YOU ARE!!!!
Should be required viewing in every middle shcool evrywhere
Beautiful tuvo su reconocimiento en el 2002, hagamosla viral en este 2022 👏
An absolute classic & another absolutely beautiful video....🙌🏼💖🙌🏼💖🙌🏼💖🙌🏼💖🙌🏼💖
Simply Beautiful :)
Tears of joy.
I always loved this song
🥺🥺🥺🥺🫶🏽
El tema con el que elegí entrar a mi fiesta de egresados.  Luego de Mi Reflejo o Reflection, es la canción que más me ha interpelado y una voz que, no importa que no la exprese en mi idioma, me hace sentir todo de igual manera. We are beautiful, no matter what they say!
Me encanta la versión 2022!!!!!
I believe I am Beautiful. Thanks Christina ❤️
This video arouse public awareness as reflect to the recent world, we are real human living in the image platform. It make us to think what the unique creature that God create us as human being. Each one is unique and precious gifted by the nature. No need to live by someone’s mouth or judgement.
Excelente ❤❤❤❤❤❤
This song is timeless. I won't lie it was sad and hard to see this new generation portrait but it is all true.
Masterpiece. ❤
Definitivamente  me quedo con la versión original!!!👌🏽
I LOVE YOU XTINA ! WE ARE PERFECTION IN OUR WAYS !
i don't post on alot of these videos but i have to say this new version video of this song is actually "BEAUTIFUL" this is the best by far video of this song!!
❤️‍🩹
This is a bop-
Atemporal!!!
el mundo sin celular era mejor
Thank you ❤
Look deep inside of yourself while playing this beautiful song.. because you are beautiful
Una canción que me acompañó en mis momentos más obscuros, ahora con un mensaje más fuerte para nuestros niños ❤
Queen !!!!
You're the best! Thank you for this!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I hope this extends to the craziness that is gender ideology. Let's teach our kids there is no right way or wrong way to be a boy a girl, no need for hormones or surgery.
Que lindo 😭😭😭😭
YOU are beautiful no matter what they say!
Feliz navidad... a todos.
Wow. I’m just floored. This was remarkable
Pertinent and still a beautiful song
Aquí uno de los 90 MTV top 10
Of course words can bring you down, especially in this lib world we live in😂
Saben por que el video dejó de recaudar?
crazy we still need a song with tis message, now MORE THAN EVER, Chris we love you.
#PrayForAmerica
Me hiciste llorar hace 20 años y lo vuelves a hacer hoy con esta canción, es tan imponente, tan importante para mí como seguramente para muchos otros que nos supimos querer más y valorarnos, recordar que no importa lo que digan los demás, que también somos personas y todos somos hermosos e importantes siendo como somos. Muy agradecido por eso ❤️❤️❤️❤️
We freaking Stan this queen
Sin duda alguna ,el ejemplo claro de una sociedad ,que vas más allá de sentimientos si no solo superficialidad actualmente  y los niños ya no juegan solo están todo tiempo en el celular en su propio mundo .
It's a great new video and I still love this song. I hate to be the negative one but it was somewhat hard to watch because Christina has had so much work done and it makes me sad that such a naturally beautiful woman fell for the same thing she preached against.
Plastic surgery is life 🥰
I like the message, but doesn't Christina have work done herself? 😮‍💨
An Hymn then and an Hymn Now... 🥺
End beauty standards for kids. End beauty pageants for kids. End skinny waist teas for kids.
When is the album out
Erizada la piel de principio a fin 🇪🇨👏✌
Thanks Christina for Promoting self love and acceptance from my daughter and myself. I loved this song as a teen with struggles and now I can share this with my daughter. ❤️❤️❤️
Wow this is powerful and beautiful ✌️❤️🫂💪🙏👏👏👏
So good
Amazing Xtina. 💞
OK, WHO'S CHOPPING THE ONIONS?
wow...
This is such a great video that this generation of children really need to watch
This song became more to me than just a tune on the radio.. it was my self acceptance anthem and for you remake this video at this time just reinforces the importance of Self Acceptance. THIS IS AN AMAZING VIDEO!!!
Watch a song about self acceptance..followed by an ad based on body shaming. Good job YouTube
Strong message ❤❤❤ please let’s help our kids and teenagers. La tecnologia ayuda hacer el trabajo mas eficiente pero las redes social es Han destruido las relaciones interpersonales e inclusive las relaciones amorosas. La comunicacion entrenpersonas se esta perdiendo dia a dia trusted realidad. Gracias Christina por este hermoso video espero mucho padres ayuden a sus hijos y que los hijos disfruten su infancies y adolescencia.
😢😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤
Lindo lindo lindo  música atemporal 😍😍
I'm not crying you're crying we're all crying. From 2002 too 2022
This song touches your heat just like the song: Alessia Cara - Scars To Your Beautiful That we get sold an image of what's beautiful, but it's empty and vane.  What's beautiful is usually what's found on the inside, more than the outside.
The first version of the video clip is better.
Yeah going to the gym just seems like one of those branches of body image issues that aren't talked about. There's getting strong and then there's looking strong
#Beautiful will forever be a timeless classic. Thank you #Xtina for taking this song to another level with your amazing talent and ability to put so emotion in every word. ❤️ #Stripped
I cried. Felt goosebumps. The message in this new videoclip is so necessary. THANK YOU!
Beautiful message beautiful voice.  Thank you, Christina ❤
I prefer the first one!
let's keep playing we're trending here in USA, sigamos reproduciendo estamos en tendencia aquí en USA .
Beautiful
Just beautiful 😍
Simplesmente lindo
Esse hino completa 20 anos
Lindooooo... Amo my Queen 👑
why I'm crying 😭
this is why i look up to her
Yassd
Well done Christina. I agree with every single thing you said at the end of this video. Absolutely spot on. Something needs to be done about it and quick. Myself I don't believe social media has ever been a good thing, especially not for children and teenagers. I am 100% behind you on this.
Thank you for shining light on this.
Wow !!! Xtina gracias por esta pieza de arte
Una vez más, pero con nuevos estereotipos más  actuales nos demuestras que podemos ser hermosos ! I love Christina ❤️
Wow. 20 years later and this still resonates with me but on a new level. Society has a lot to answer for.
what is this an A21 film?
Chorei
❤️👏
As a middle school English teacher, I had many students who chose to research body-image trends. I think of them with a tear running down my face, watching this updated video. They are beautiful, and so is this video. Bravo, Christina.😪🥰💖💕💞💜💜💙💙👏👏
Hermosa melodia con una voz extraordinaria 🤙
https://youtu.be/9QFuRDhc2nU
One of my favorite songs ❤
💗  #ChristinaAguilera  #Beautiful  #Beautiful2022
Que incrível essa atualização! Demonstrando o quanto esse hit é atemporal. Hoje sob um olhar de mãe. Ficou incrível!
So glad I had this song when I was growing up. It's needed more than ever now.
Wow! So powerful and meaningful! ❤
the fact that even though the original music video is 20 years old, it was more diverse, more real and more inclusive, this version looks more like a publicity stunt. There is not even one overweight or genuinely struggling person has been included in the video? such a pity.
Thank God for You!!! Let's Go.💜
I find it odd how the song talks about being a beauty however you are yet only "beautiful-looking" people are used in the video. Irony or hypocrisy: which one is it? Btw, Xtina, how not to love that unique deep feeling you transmit backbone-through with your voice. What a gift (you are)!
.
The song and message our society so desperately needs right now. Absolutely speechless at how powerfully Christina is always able to put my thoughts into music.
Thank you for speaking it out
La idea es re buena, lastima la ejecución del video la estética que contradice lo que predica. Todo muy bello y egemonico. Y la única persona con sobre peso no aparece al final del video es el prado donde todos son feliz. Muy muy lejos de superar al Beautiful original 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
So beautiful, So amazing! ❤️
Está joya de canción SIEMPRE será especial ✨
Aaaaaaaa
Just shows these poor children should be living their childhood. Not trying to look perfect. It's sad to think kids don't run around anymore but spend time on tik tok and all that rubbish.
It’s so deep and actual in this awful 2022
It’s BEAUTIFUL… ❤🎶🎧😌
Nossa, que lindo! Versão mais que merecida 🤍
Thank YOU SO MUCH FROM A WOMAN THAT IS IN RECOVERY FROM BINGE PURGE ANOREXIA  FOR 27 YESRS!!!!Finally someone has made such a poignant video/ social outlet to help  save lives!!!BLESS YOU!!!
The amount so far donated is sad. 2,316 comments, 501,764 views and only $433 raised. You can do the math if everyone just donated $5.
Essa música é incrível e carrega uma mensagem  sobre amor próprio nos dizendo que somos lindos e "não importa o que os outros digam ou falam, somos lindos ao nosso ver"
3:25 - nothing feels better than a great hug when you really need it
This is heart breaking. Let kids be kids. Yup. ♡
Eu achei tão bonito s2, ai assisti d enovo e vi que só tinha criança padrão ahuhuahuauhauhauhhuauha
Stripped gave me so much as a teen. I’m always going to be thankful for this record. Listened to Stripped religiously.  Now, this video. Don’t like it. The visual doesn’t connect/mashup well with the song. It looks very much like fan made video.   I see what she was trying to say but… yeah…  This video is a NO for me.   Sincerely, a Fighter.
Video hits hard. A lot had changed in 20 years
Very moving and well done Christina. This I feel is the way the song was meant to be. To help the young of today know that they matter and are loved. 😂
I was scrolling through youtube & just saw this ! This is great ! I loved the original song as well as this one ! Love u so much ❤
Xtina, thank you from the bottom of my heart. You helped me come out to my parents when I was 14 when this song came out and helped me understand that it was okay to love myself and not be ashamed to be myself. Through many growth stages in my life your music has helped remind me to be authentic and true to my heart. Seeing this new video is a great reminder for so many people all over the world. Keep on keepin on, girl. I love you ❤️
This is rich coming from a woman who has plasticed herself into a ditzy blonde KarTRASHian.
Waoooo beautiful ❤
Sings the woman who herself has had multiple plastic surgeries.
Christina trazendo em uma música que foi um clássico um problema ainda tão atual, infelizmente a internet tem seu lado bom e seu lado sombrio, as consequências da exposição já começou...
Genius.
Wow I cried too 🥺 at 44 I feel pressurised to look a certain way  I love my daughter for embracing her individuality and not conforming to the social crap 🥰
timeless song becoming more relevant as time goes by.
❤❤❤❤
Undoubtedly, that's one of my favourite songs of all time. I learned how to play the guitar with it and fell in love with "Stripped". Christina's vocals add beautifully to Linda Perry's majestic music and lyrics. Such a powerful message, such a moving videoclip, such a relevant and upsetting  update to our sickening modern times! Thanks for the new version! All this needs to change and we must talk about it, spread the thought that we are all beautiful! ❤️
Powerful Message !
Muy lindo el mensaje, los medios bombardean a la juventud con unos estereotipos nocivos para el desarrollo de una sana personalidad. Dejemos a los niños SER NIÑOS.
Beautiful. I hope my daughter sees this. … my darling girl, you are beautiful. And I love you.x
ungodly filth that sends you to HELL!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The next time you think of beautiful things, don’t forget to count yourself in.
❤❤❤❤
Hino atemporal
Perfect.
The beautiful song made me cry and feel so good about myself when I was bullied for being chubby as a teenager and I'll forever be grateful queen 🙏🏼💖💖🌹💋 I still get body shamed now and get PTSD at times even in my 30s, I hate all this pressure always on women to be or look a certain way
Gracias a este video me dio ganas de ver la traducción de esta canción. Gracias por la letra a Linda Perry, a Christina por la interpretación y a Fiona Jane por el video. ✌
This song originally came out when I was in highschool and was a much needed message that helped me accept myself. I am so happy this has been brought back up with a new video that todays youth can relate to in the new struggles of today, especially because I now have teenagers myself. A beautiful message that is beautifully done Christina as always
Love the new video . And this song is timeless and very iconic for sure
I like your video when it came out all those years ago I like what she did with the new version about body shame I hope they listen to her message it's a good one💖
Omg it feels like was yesterday she came out whit this iconic song 🎵 I always was  was listening this CD  and SIMON CALL  HER SLOT FOR THE VIDEO DIRTY How a guy like him who's cheating on his wife have the nerves to make a comment like that?.... fighters  he needs to apologize to our queen XTINA 👸 # WE LOVE YOU XTINA ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  and still make me cry like 20  Year's ago  thank ypu queen for the strong  message  💖 💓 💗 ❤️ 💕 💛
Wow made me feel so beautiful when I was a little girl and now as a grown woman
TLC should re-release unpretty! I think both records highlight self worth and care.
Was not expecting to cry today. Thank you for this
Siempre fue una hermosa cancion
Classic❤
20 years later and this song still hits the same, if not harder. The beauty standards have just gotten worse and crazier. This song is going to resonate with a whole new generation and hopefully help even more people to learn to love themselves just the way they are. Once again crying at this beautiful song, video, and message. Thank you Xtina!
Great till they just had to throw in the gay boy thing.🙄no longer good. Shut down
And the world got worse since this song came out.
As a 19 year old this really does show it accurately the internet really grew me up, way to early and having borderline unrestricted access to internet since age 9 has done irreversible psychological damage to me and I’ve seen it happen many times to many people my age it’s really scary honestly
And yet christina does shit to her face? Wtf xtina girl i don't get it. I love you but i dont get it.
Beautiful. Loved it. Made me really emotional having 2 children that are living this reality... POWERFUL!
Christina, you are Phenomenal!
This is great! Definitely something these generations need to be reminded of.
This literally came out when I was debating whether to get a nose job or not. Now I realize how stupid it is and I should be happy for who I am ❤
Simplesmente perfeito💙
La Amoooooo ❤❤❤❤❤ Queen Xtina
My girls are 6 and 10, I don't want them to live in this social media nightmare that's poisoning the rest of us, asking for every second of our time to be glued to their platforms. This video is where we are right now, it will only change when we're ready for radical changes in our screen habits, our lifestyles, eating habits, consumer patterns, our children need us.
Such an amazing song! I've loved it since I was a little kid
It also aligns perfectly with social contagion issues that affect people's sense of self, worth and identity. Acceptance isn't the correct analysis for the increase. Confusion is, yet the solution offered is pharmaceuticals and surgery as well.
Great song. 👍🏼 Evergreen 💚 🎧 🎆 📻 🌲 ♥️
❤ iconic legendary. Thank you for safe my life back in the Very confused days . Love you forever @Christina Aguilera
20 anos depois e continua sendo um hino atemporal essa música.   Essa música é de uma discussão social GIGANTESCA. Numa sociedade que hoje é ainda mais complicada.   Essa música é perfeita.  Hino atemporal.
Love christina Aguilera…😍❤❤😍
Simply beautiful..  she out sings so many of her peers and I honestly believe if she wasn’t so good the ones that make their dreams a reality (music executives, investors, record labels etc) would have given her the recognition she deserves rather than protecting the ones they put the money and time into making famous
Still an amazing song that is sang with love. This new video is awesome. Very powerful for everyone who needs to hear the message. You are beautiful. I am beautiful. We are beautiful.
Loved this song, the first time it came out. Christina, love your voice.
Como siempre nunca  decepciona XTINA, entiendo que esta  nueva versión 20 aniversario, no ha querido ser protagonista  para darle mas visibilidad al problema de nuestra actualidad. Que son las redes sociales y la superficialidad, y los Smartphones 📲🖥💻🎬 e tecnología actual.   Me ha encantado☺ a pesar de ser un video sencillo , va directo al problema y al espectador mas joven .  Es un problema real de nuestra sociedad actual sobre todo en el 1º mundo.   Enhorabuena y super orgulloso de ser fan tuyo. Esta canción y v videoclip  marco un antes y un después en mi vida adolescente en el 2002 , donde yo tenia 13  años y estaba en un nueva nueva etapa de mi vida adolescente y descubriendo que era gay. Y que no era malo ni un bicho raro.  Saludos desde Murcia , España y fan de XTINA siempre🤩😎  #20YearsOfStripped  #20YearsOfBeautiful
"Hermoso"  [Hablado] No me mires  Cada día es tan maravilloso Entonces de repente es difícil respirar De vez en cuando me siento inseguro De todo el dolor, estoy tan avergonzado  Soy hermoso sin importar lo que digan Las palabras no pueden traerme abajo Soy hermosa en todos los sentidos Sí, las palabras no pueden derribarme... Oh no Así que no me derribes hoy  Para todos tus amigos estás delirando Tan consumido en toda tu perdición Tratando de llenar el vacío Las piezas se fueron, dejaron el rompecabezas deshecho ¿Es así?  Eres hermosa sin importar lo que digan Las palabras no pueden derribarte... oh no Eres hermosa en todos los sentidos Sí, las palabras no pueden derribarte, oh, no Así que no me derribes hoy  No importa lo que hagamos (No importa lo que hagamos) No importa lo que digamos (No importa lo que digamos) Somos los Canción dentro de la melodía Llena de hermosos errores  Y dondequiera que vayamos (Y dondequiera que vayamos) El sol siempre brillará (El sol siempre, siempre brillará) Y mañana podríamos despertar del otro lado  Somos hermosos sin importar lo que digan Sí , las palabras no nos derribarán, no, no Somos hermosos en todos los sentidos Sí, las palabras no pueden derribarnos, oh, no Así que no me derribes hoy  Oh, sí, no me derribes yo abajo hoy, sí, ooh No me defraudes ooh... hoy
This song and the video(s) are powerful. I hate the world we live in. Where women have to have Big Boobs skinny noses, hourglass figures. Men can't be who they truly are. It's ok to be overweight, have face blemishes , etc. Everybody is beautiful! Sure, we aren't rich fashion models, but that's ok. As long as people are comfortable in their own skin. Don't worry about what other people say about you. It's ok to be Straight, Gay, Bisexual, transsexual, transgendered. Be who YOU want to be! Don't be what THEY want you to be ❤️❤️
"Beautiful"  [Spoken] Don't look at me  Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain, I'm so ashamed  I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down... Oh no So don't you bring me down today  To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?  You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down...oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune Full of beautiful mistakes  And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side  We are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  Oh, yeah, don't you bring me down today, yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down ooh... today

La canción más hermosa y poderosa Me ayudó tanto en mi adolescencia a aceptar quien soy ♥️
I am 54 years old and I still struggle with my body.  With acceptance.  With how I look and how I interact with my grandchildren and how they look.  I don't want to do to them what was EVER done to me.
This a really good message in todays society but also kind of an oxymoron when Christina herself got fillers and lip injections
It's beautiful ❤❤❤
Christina, I love you, but where is the representation of those with disabilities?
POV: Trying to find a another English comment
Because Christina certainly doesn't adhere to modern beauty standards 🙄
…No matter what they say…❌tina
20 years after it still feels the same! Xtina you are truly an artist that is a trendsetter and would be one for decades to come! ❤
Thank you Xtina!♥️
El final que impactante! Hay mucha farsa en las redes sociales y hay gente que se compara todo el tiempo con muchos personajes llenos de filtros y se siente inferior o hace lo imposible para parecérse! Xtina te sigo amando! Me recuerdas cosas positivas de mi adolescencia ❤
This song will Last Forever! "Beautiful" hits home and the Heart!! Thank You Christina Aguilera for making this Awesome song!❤❤
yeah, we needed a 2022 version of this for a fundraiser.... gfy
Crítica social foda
Good song for my soul ❤️❤️❤️ still the best for me thank you Christina 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Little girls that have been out here waging war with each other trying to be you are already bringing up a new generation of their own little warriors.  We all want a drink.  How about we call it 10 One Thousand n outs?  Recess is only so long.  Hurry up so we can play four square and tether ball before the bell rings.
One of the most beautiful song ever...
Danke für dieses neue Video!
This is so timely and relevant. I recently heard that more than half of all children want to be influencers. The message needs to be heard -- Every one of you is beautiful, just as you are, not as you might imagine the world/internet would want you to be,
The set and props where amazing!
Muy dura ❤‍🔥, Pero no se ingles... 😂
Andrew Tate voice was there wtf
This has always been a classic song during my life. I heard it from my cousin's bat mitzvah dvd (don't ask) and I loved it ever since. <3
That was powerful!  Thank you!
Just go Away! Not every kid wants to be a Degenerate.
Me hizo llorar a los 5 años y ahora a los 25 😭💘
This song got me through an abusive marriage..now I’m hearing  it again an smiling an crying happy tears because I’m free of that life an very happy!! Thank you Christina ❤️❤️❤️ ❤❤
💛💛
Gen-Z needs to hear this song it has a very important message. This is a timeless song. I bought Stripped when it came out and I always loved this song.
Amazing
Eso es quedarse estancada.... Pobre Aguilera .,zzzzzzzzz  Mejor vean #monotonia
Wow 🥺
OMG! you ever nail it! Love you teacher! Te debo mucho muchoooooooo de alma a alma GRAXIAS
wow! so beautiful! God Bless you!
Hope to watch Beautiful live performance and remastered /Always love 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
This is perfect and much needed!
First world problems 🚮
Very offensive. Just another attempt to brainwash children with images of plastic surgery for body image. No longer a fan!
I love this song...  in  GLEE they use it so good! Sorry but this kind of "over view" show just one side... there's a lot of other ways...  you CHANGE THE SITUATION... it's not just the body...  and who was blessed with a strong budy "must to feel bad about it ? " ... may be have fellings about it... if you  think you help somebody - sorry this kid of production to enforce the paradigma! There's more people to being strong around the world...  a lot of resilient youngers... that fight every day for they lifes... a lot young people taking care of they fathers... the young people are the future! GIVE to THEN HOPE ! It's time to joy, give a hope, planning the future... WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS ! WE SURVIVE A PANDEMIC ! WE HAVE WAYS!  TECHNOLOGIES! WE COULD HELP OTHERS! LET'S SHOW THE NEXT GENERATION HOW BLESSED THEY ARE! THEY HAVE THE FUTERE IN THEY MINDS, HANDS... I believe in the future... yhe young people are the future! Let's elevate then! Let's celebrate it!
The mere fact that young people are no longer the protagonists of the video and now children are who suffer from all this, it destroys me. love them more please!
20 years of Stripped! Wow! Thank you Christina for always being who you are and making us feel beautiful. Mucho Mucho amor Reina!
Lloraba con la version original y ahora con esta tambien. We're all beautiful ❤️
Perfeita em suas duas versões💞
I love Christina. Love HER. But why? Did the world really need this video to be remade? I feel like she keeps milking this song to death. This video is not reintroducing this song to a new generation. Instead, it is diminishing the impact of the original. I wish she would focus on putting out new music in English, or even cover songs from other singers.
Absolutely necessary to keep spreading this message. Changed my life in 2002, and gave me confidence. You were my first concert ever and still a huge fan today. Only thing I would have loved to see in here is trans children, because they go through it too and don’t have enough representation. Thanks for doing this though! Not complaining at all
The greatest vocalist of her time ❤
The message here is worthy, but lets not forget to see the irony of a music industry which thrives on marketing to the young the idealisms this video critiques. The child actors enter an industry which selects on the same basis. Pointing at the bankruptcy and harms by which they profit is not just ironic, it is deceiptful.
Очень красиво. Спасибо, Кристина, что говоришь о проблемах современности. Пусть все дети мира будут счастливы и любимы
DESERVE MUCH MORE VIEWS, Xtina are so UNDERRATED. <3
Probably the most relatable ballad song in the world.
My son auditioned for this.
Nueva versión de este video
This song still hits 20 years later!
Thank you for this message 🥲💜
Thank you, Christina for this video. Seeing the kids holding and staring into their phones like that.... a void and so soulless. So very sad our sweet humans are being brought up this way.  An important reminder for not just kids but adults too,  to put your phones down and go outside.
Great song!!!
Forever top nr1❤
It's not so much the technology, it's what people are providing through the technology that's the problem. All things in moderation is fine and less emphasis on fantasy. More reality is needed. Corporations will always spew what they can to influence people to want certain things so they can continue gaining money. We don't have to bite. We can teach our kids that it's all bs and teach them self love from very early ages. Vanity will always exist and business and greed will always exist. Practice loving yourself, it's a game changer.
The moment that the song played, I cried because this song is part of my life and it reminds me how beautiful I am as person.
Esta canción me recuerda cuando comencé a descubrirme en el 2002 ya han pasado 20 años omg! Excelente mensaje hoy en día super vigente!
I preferred the original video... This is depressing... Good song still tho...
Hypocrisy. We've seen all your videos where you don't have an ounce of body fat, have perfect makeup, Flawless costumes, and it's overtly sexual.   Kids are smarter than this.
Funny because xtina looks SO produced, with toncs of makeup in all her Instagram pictures…the inconsistency
iconic in the past, iconic now!! ❤🇧🇷
Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is? You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side 'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
Perfeito demais!
So incredibly impactful, Christina.
Such an important message but so little attention. THANK YOU for this song which helped me in my young years!  It's so important to accept yourself. And don't look at the "perfect examples".
Amo profundamente la cantidad de simbolismos que tiene 20 años después!
Woderfullllll great 😍
Yes Queen.
One of the biggest problems in our society and we all let this happen over the last 20 years. Thanks for this.
Social media and cell phones…just one reason why Americans are no longer capable of thinking for themselves.
I always loved this song growing up, thanks for bringing it back <3 <3
Let Children be Normal....
Beautiful! A message so needed still. ❤❤❤ Crying sad topic- great song.😢
Advertisement industry is the reason for all this “standards” they created walking billboards like influencers and the Kardashian types.
43$ donated?
seriously you are all pedophiles, stop sexualizing children
Christina, our queen… Absolutely stunning campaign!! People like you can promote this louder than anyone else! ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
As a father of five, thank you for this version.  Thank you.
The one and only CA
Thank you! No more words needed!
Dejen de congelarle las Visitas a la gran Christina Aguilera!!!!
I remember the early 00s Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears and their flat stomachs — and how to get them — were absolutely inescapable, just everywhere: “get an 18in waist like X-Tina.” Blah blah blah. Their image that faced the public in regards to their bodies was the standard next to horrible tips and drugs to get that body aimed entirely at young girls in my generation. TrimSpa and Metabolife were marketed as a guarantee to get that Dirrrrty body. I took it. My friends took it. It gave me tachycardia lol. It’s cool that she redid this song.
😂
Beautyfull.....olhem bem para suas crianças,todas,eles não sabem nada da vida,talvez você saiba,...
Ícone 🥺👑🙏❤️
🙏🪔🙌
Why we don’t understand that we are beautiful the way we are ?
Este Video SÍ me gusta mucho.. la Canción siempre me FASCINÓ.. pero en ese entonces el Vídeo que  hizo  NO. 😔 Está canción y este vídeo SÍ lo puedo ver con mis HIJOS e ir Platicando con ellos y explicando de qué habla la Canción. GRACIAS CHRISTINA ❤️
Muy hermoso
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Pretty confused video, I understand where it's coming from, but.. Lifting weights is not a bad thing to do.. yes 99% of plastic surgery is not necessary and is definitely bad for kids.. kids are being exposed to the wrong kind of role models.. and is it me or has Miss Aguilera had implants, so she is part of the problem 🤔🤔🤔
There is something soo real about Christina Aguilera! I really like her as a Sister! Keep going on Christina!
😌❤
❤❤❤❤
Que emocionante
Way to woke ruin.
Thank you christina is beatiful❤❤❤❤❤❤
And one more time it made cry... Beautiful...🙏🙏🙏🙏
Not a dry eye
Why did you have to link your website at the end? Couldn't have linked to actual resources? This is pretty gross.
Timeless Masterpiece 🤍🖤 It hits as strong as it did 20 years ago!
Someone gave me this song 20 years ago. It had saved my life so many times since then. It was and still is the best song anyone had ever gave me. Thank you for always being the light at the end of the tunnel.
Perfect
Sehr wichtiges Thema. Kinder müssen lernen, dass sie gut sind, so wie wir Mamas sie gebaut haben. Für uns Mütter gibt es nichts schöneres als unsere Kinder. Dieser ganze Schönheitswahnsinn muss endlich mal aufhören.
The world needed this right now!! Thank you Christina Aguilera!
I love this
Powerful!
The fact that this anthem has got to be re-released 20 years later shows how little we've actually done to improve our youth's wellbeing. We need to do better.
Falou tudo
Como sempre entregando tudo
Great video christina! We really have a lot of problems today in society and it's definitely true that social media causes a lot of them! I've been a fan of yours since the 90s and I still am a fan today. I'm glad you put this message out there
20年前にこの曲に出会い、私は自分を受け入れる事、他者を受け入れる事を決めました。あなたの歌声は、間違いなく私の人生を照らし続けてくれています。沢山の愛をありがとう。大好きです。  Listening to this song 20 years ago and decided to embrace myself and others. Your voice definitely continues to light up my life. Thank you for all the love. I love you Christina.
Wow es increíble y que mensaje, volver a escuchar Beautiful después de tantos años me hace remontarme al ayer y ver el hoy me ayudó muchísimo, grande Christina Aguilera, saludos de Honduras tu fan no.1 ✌🏽🇭🇳💙🏳️‍🌈
So powerful ❤
stop abusing children. nothing here is beautiful - children slaves to their phones, how they look and a pill for everything. come on people, at least try to see it - no one's hiding anymore
Que top
Shame on Youtube for playing a diet video at the end of the video. You are the problem, Youtube.
Pretty hurts
That’s an idea
Un himno que te levanta el ánimo en los momentos más difíciles de tu vida. Gracias, Christina ❤🇪🇨
the lirycs musical its beautiful but the music its horrible, i don't like the way she sing,i don't understand why she scream?
Excellent Message!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why
Esto SÍ es música ❤️
I'm only 20 when I heard this song, now going 40 and mother of 3..I'm still BEAUTIFUL ❤️❤️❤️
Uwielbiam tą piosenkę bo pozwala uwierzyć w siebie mimo tego co inni mówią o nas
yessss this is so relate with reality ... we are beautifull in oour way
It’s 2022 and had to downvote because of no closed captions
not my language!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
🙌🙌🙌🙌
Amo la manera en que estás cambiando el odio por amor y ayudando a muchos en sus procesos, el mundo necesita más artistas que quieran crear impactos positivos con su arte y no solo hits vacíos de un día... Gracias por inspirarnos y por seguir inspirando a nuevas generaciones ❤️
Goosebumps ❤
🤞
🍃You did this in my lucky 2002 now bk again in the very much needed super lucky 2022! Which is really just suffering in the land of opposites. This is so powerful! Thank you for your art  Christina 💛 much love ✌🏻
Absolutely stunning!
A big help
A bond.
Your awareness group
God loves you, a movement I started for abused children at by parents that try to hide , behind social media , I wanna speak up for them, I think I'm going to call it Speak on abuse !!!
this songs really good for mental health and self-care.. being beautiful for me is in ourselves because we must know who we are and what worth we have no matter what's our color shapes ethnics and religion.
Be yourself.
Keep striving be wild child strong.
Insecure, stress will take you down 👇👎
🙏💋🎶‼️
💫⭐✨👐🤔
👐✨⭐💫
Your beautiful Christina keep doing you !!!
Your beautiful America
Christina Aguilera best
("Todo@s Somos HERMOSOS: son los Ojos Críticos, que nos hacen sentir Mal.y lo peor del todo, es que no se ven 🎭. Gracias Cristina Aguilera por esta  Canción 😥❤🌹❤🌹😘.))
WHERE ARE ALL THE DUDES/HOMIES AT WHO SECRETLY LIKE THIS SONG BUT WON'T TELL ANYONE?!
Крістіна, а ти сама де загубилась?
Gilakkkkk lagu ni di rilis lg dan di tahun thun skrg ini emg kita lagibergelut dgn standarisasi kecantikan yg berlaku dimasyrakat kt mau pada laki laki atawpun wanita. Kita musti nya tdk ikutin standar itu dan gak usah kt peduli, jgn jadi insecure tetap lah Bersyukur. Sehat sehat kalian semua nya… we’re all Beautiful!!! Btw gw jdi inget lagu nya si yura dan gajah nya Tulus
Esta canción salvó mi vida hace 20 años. Gracias Xtina por esto. 😍
GAP meets Calvin Klein visuals
This Anthem aged extremely well! Can’t wait to get this new Stripped anniversary album !
It‘s the Perfect Song and Video for this Times 2022
You may preach this love now but your experience with the media has negatively impacted my life and ruined my self esteem. Happy to see awareness now but the damage has been done to so many children. And no lgbt rep either. How sad.
It was a good idea but not well made, after all the teasers it feels that we already saw the whole video
I love the concept, but, I was waiting for a different instrumental version :/ that's okay... Luv u Aguilera!!!
Been a Christina fan since the late 90s but I've never been keen on this song,  even 20 years later. But I'm not into inspirational songs in general. Good message, though.
Still one of the best song
this song is really amazing
Fiquei emocionada, infelizmente a realidade continua assim, pessoas cada vez mais novas preocupadas com a aparência,  sempre procurando defeitos em si mesmas e julgando as outras pessoas. Mas a mensagem da música é importantíssima, Cristina e Linda Perry nunca decepciona ❤🌹
Talking about the issues that matter. Thank you Christina! <3
❤️❤️
Loving it ! La Aguilera siempre reinventándose ! Love her !
Damnit, why'd you gotta release this song? Biden hasn't been able to stop sniffing his phone screen.
It’s hits deeper in 2022 ❤
Gorgeous and poignant.
Christina. Bravo for this video. Please people, try to make this place better for living. We all try to live something fake.
This song is timeless.  As technology keeps evolving and with photos being so easy to manipulate, this will continue to be an issue.
Powerful
Thank you in loving memory of Brooke  to covid 19 last February and Lynn last April
stunning and so relevant today. tysvm
Esta joya tiene que ir en generación en generación. No ha ayudado a crecer a muchos.
Кристина сделала себе губы...
This song is needed more than ever now that Social Media isn't going anywhere. Sad how toxic stands of beauty are relevant.
omg. engga pernah gagal lagu ini! masa muda, dewasa dan menuju tua!
There are songs that need to be redone certain time, this is the example of it... No changes, no remix nothing same beautiful song. <3
Thank you, Christina ❤️
This is hilarious.  Christina Aguilera had extensive plastic surgery plus breast implants done.  I guess she doesn't believe in the message of her own music
QEU COSA TAN HERMOSA
Love this song so much but I like the original video more! It has more LGBTQ awareness. 🏳️‍🌈 🏳️‍⚧️
👏👏👏
este video esta cargado de tanta realidad, los niños son la primera victima de la falsedad de la autoimagen perfecta y debemos reflexionar y protegerlos, gracias Christina ❤️💯
❤
I'm crying 😭
Gosh, the first video was so #iconic and powerful. This is a whole new level 🥺.  PS - Anyone who watches this without getting chocked up is a serial killer 😅. (Just kidding).
This has a VERY IMPORTANT message.
La escuchaba cuando era niño ...maravillosa canción 👏❤️
❤❤❤❤
Being beautiful is something which stays with us when we are spiritually focused and take care of our health.
Perhaps parents need to take responsibility and not allow their kids to be on these social media apps for very long. Limit their use, it starts there.
If I saw this version, instead of 2002's version, perhaps I would never consider Beautiful as a gay song, iconic, as it are. I remember it was Xtina choice to did that way in 2002. Linda Perry, who wrote the song, as a gay person like us, probably didn’t want to fight so explicit for that. In that time, we always wanted to be "softy" with this issue. Thank you Xtina, you had vision. You were burned at the stake for the society, we can’t even know what you passed through. You definitely changed peoples lives. Even today it’s hard to see, but in 2002, a young and strong girl, put a gay kiss in a videoclip, at the television, for the first time in history. You always will be HUGE! ✊🏻✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿
Such meaningful video
The best re-imagining of a video ever!!! Thank you thank you thank you
The best re-imagining of a video ever!!! Thank you thank you thank you
I am the English comment you're looking for
Amooooooo!!! 👏👏👏👏
This song came out when I was 3 years old & now I am 23 😭 I remember crying to the original video at such a young age. It was the first time I had seen portrayals of disordered eating & transgender representation. I was moved by the video even with my small, unknowing, growing mind. This new video accurately portrays the struggles of my generation, the first to grow up with social media. The body image issues are so real! But we are all beautiful 🤍
👏👏👏👏👏👏
I wish she recorded the song and sang it the way she would do it nowadays.
♡♡♡
Tanto es asi que ella se puso los labios nuevos, estando perfecta,🤦🤦🤦🤦, ya me acostumbraste pero al principio me horrorise, anyways 🌷😍
I love this song forever .. so beautiful❤❤❤
I needed this.
Perfeito, Christina você poderia ter regravado com a voz atualmente teria ficado wanderful.
I love love love love it , and Christina's voice it's crazy 💜❤
Muito lindo
Amo esta canción, a muchos nos ayudó a entender que somos diferentes pero hermosos digan lo que digan otros de tí, lo importante es amarse uno y eso se refleja ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Omg
she took this video to the next level, so much more relatable and more real, too real tbh
You made me cry again😭❤️
Este no solo es un himno para la comunidad LGBTTTIQ+, es para todos a los que nos han querido lastimar y también los que nos hemos lastimado. Gracias por recordarnos... HERMOSOS POR SIEMPRE
This is so important and powerful omfg love you queen.
ganda..
A mesma mensagem ❤
everyone needs THE Christina in their life
https://youtu.be/Oev-H5ZJQI0
Thank you for taking the initiative to post this and speak up about this
A lot has changed in 20 years. This song is more relevant today than ever. Things are better on paper but not in real life.
WoW!!! Gracias Christina 😘 muchas gracias por existir
que clipe necessario
Society and social media are brainwashing these kids. If you think the Kardashians are beautiful and hot you should ask them why do plastic surgery in the first place?
Already was an outstanding song and video.  This new video makes just as important a statement which I hope is seen, supported and acted upon within society and those such beauty requirements are targeted at.  The fashion of beauty destroys too many lives in general and childhoods in particular.  Wonderful song, wonderful video.
My favorite song❤️
🤍🤍🤍
The video is so dull
stop body shaming, love ourself #mentalAwareness 🇵🇭
💙
Himno ❤
Right now We need this song more than ever to remind us that we need not conform to society’s definition of beauty and self worth…
Sweet sadness, sweet love, sweet breath, sweet melody, thank You Xtina! 🇪🇨♥️❤️♥️🇪🇨
It's interesting how that works out.  This song is about how everyone is beautiful in their own way and despite what anyone says.  People are born into circumstances they can't fix. But that doesn't make them ugly, because it's the inside that counts, not the outside.  Still, apparently, in the opinion of the singer or her management, not everyone is beautiful, because not everyone gets to see this clip.  After all, bulling and cancelling the population of an entire country despite their opinion of the current situation -- that's okay, right? Born in Russia and you're no longer beautiful, no matter what you really are.  Russian = NOT beautiful, No matter what they say. Only matters where you are born. In this case. Ok, well, understood.
Hey 👋
Beautiful
Gracias por hacerme sentir comprendido y aceptado, sobretodo por contribuir a que me ame.
Me encanta ❤
Esta canción nos abraza hace 20 años
Mas videoclips con tanto sentido!!!!
As a teacher, this was a gut-punch to watch.  Kids: you are beautiful, no matter what they say.
This says a lot ❤️
Tja und es ist mit den Jahren nur noch schlimmer geworden und nicht besser.
2:58: Aún con los pelos de punta 20 años después. Christina, te amo. Eres mi ídolo. Por y para siempre. Gracias por hacerme un fighter.
This is powerful!
A great song, and more relevant than ever today
I love this song again
Esta canción es la más viva prueba de que el amor existe, amor al prójimo, le pido a diosito que esta “evolución “ que estamos viviendo cambie pronto y la gente entienda que los valores humanos y el amor es lo que importa y enseñar a esta generación a tener empatía y a entender que las palabras son más mortales que las balas, pensar antes de hablar.❤❤❤❤❤
I cried at part 1:06
Gracias por revivir esta joya tan arte!! 🤍✨
This song truly inspired me and molded me to become confident and strong enough in every adversity that I face. Whenever where I go and face different challenges this song has always part of my heart. And I will always be thankful to christina, Love u queen!
Wait didnt she get plastic surgery?
Xtina es una gran visionaria en lo social. Lo hizo muy joven en 2002 con temas "tabú" en su momento, y ahora, con el auge de redes sociales, presión sobre la imagen de los cuerpos y demás aspectos en los niños y jóvenes, lo hace desde su óptica de madre, porque seguramente le ha tocado lidiar con algo de ese mundo artificial.
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Why you have to be so cute 😫☁️
Christina Aguilera congratulations for this beautiful song
❤️❤️
I expect very much im playing it now
Powerful song
Gracias Christina Aguilera
Que mensaje tan fuerte y real.... Y que manera de revivir esta maravillosa canción
The video is not diverse. In general, I see only thin, mostly light-skinned children represented.
Beautiful
😍
😢
🫶🏽
I can't believe that the song is already 20 years old. Time flies so fast. I remember singing this song at the top of my lungs 🤭 Definitely one of my favorite songs ❤️
I wish that the song will gonna be a new arrangement but actually not.I kinda disappointed.By the way,nice music video.
poderosísimo igual que hace 20 años.
It's just a pity you couldn't have led by example christina given your own image changes plastic surgery etc. I love your voice a lot of your music but was completely put off when you decided to make yourself look like another version of nicki minaj. While what you do with your body is your choice no one else's, the message you sent out speaks for itself. Sorry if anyone doesn't like what I say but it's what I think.
Why there is no K-wave in this clip. They make standart in this era about who is handsome and who is not.
Perfeita
Queen❤
Beautiful. It makes perfect sense. Wonderful video. When everything starts to be set outside, with sun light and the tree,the branches and children dressed like children, my heart cried. I think this is a picture of a lot of countries, and I really appreciated.  My children have not the right to have phones,watch videos alone, or use whatever app they ask for. My daughter compleined she is the only one without earrings or bra (9, 10 y.o.) in her class. But she is sensitive, and she understood what it is about. Appearing rather than being. Stay safe, lotta love to everyone.
unfortunately a bitter truth 😔
Thank you madam christina
Chorei em 2002 e chorei em 2022 te amo christina
This was so beautiful ❤
Hermoso, GRACIAS❤
_ARTISTA!_
É arte!
Love you Xtina. Long love the queen of soul ❤
Very well, artistic fantastic musical composition! 🎵🎧🎵🇧🇬
Mensagem necessária. Xtina, como sempre, entregando um trabalho impecável.
Thank you for this
Isn’t it a tad hypocritical considering her own constant work done? “Do as I say not as I do, children.”
Tudo!
I loved this song then & love it STILL!! The new video is so necessary to for today!! Message STILL...LOVE who God created you to be, perfectly imperfect & beautifully flawed. Please, everyone, have an awesome day on purpose 😊
!up!
Un millón de gracias Christina por el video que trata sobre nosotros 100% Beautifull 👨‍💻👍❤
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 i really love this song 🥰🥰🥰
What a perfect description of the ridiculous situation our culture is in.
Lindo e necessário
Christina- I have loved your music from day 1- the emotion your music conveys is what makes it special. When this first came out, it had a huge impact on me because my children were little and I used it to teach them self-respect and confidence. The fact that you re-released it in an updated version and never appear speaks to the honesty, sincerity, and realness of who you are. I am grateful for you! 🙏🏾
2002 Beautiful carried a very important message for us about ourselves. 20 years later that message is more powerful and stronger than ever. #YouAreBeautiful
❤️❤️❤️❤️
En nosotros está el poder de dejar a nuestros hijos crecer siendo felices, siendo ellos mismos, enseñarles a amarse a sí mismos, a sonreír de verdad no para una selfie, no les robemos su niñez, regalemos confianza en ellos mismos. Xtina tu mensaje siempre llegará al corazón ♥️
What a wonderful piece but it would be more great if she recorded new vocals for this. Just like in the mulan 2020
Cuando salió está canción en 2002 lloré y el video representaba lo que atravesamos muchos como jóvenes y en esta nueva versión de video es lo que atraviesa ahora los jóvenes que cada vez son más pequeños llenos de bombardeos negativos que afectan su autoestima. Excelente vídeo
Omg this needs to blow up
Mas vigente que nunca, una canción himno para superar la tristeza, con esperanza🙌👏
Stream
Sickening
So powerful. Thank you for this video.
🍃🍃🐇🐇 💞 TE EQUIVOCASTE AMOR ! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
But Christina you also show a perfect image
Christina thank you! You have made me smile since the 2000!
I love this video, love it. I work with young people with mental health problems and I say to them ALL THE TIME: Be yourself, be young and worry about being an adult when it comes.
This right here 🤍🧡💚💛,  Amen
I’ve said it once and I’ll keep saying it “stripped” is a masterpiece of an album and songs like “beautiful” will live on as a timeless record for generations to come #20yearsofstripped
Twenty years after: Still timeless and beautiful.
I forgot how to be confident after Korean Wave attacked, and this song remind me to be okay with myself if it's skinny-fat, no muscle, and dont have perfect skin... the most important is... I'm healthy.
Que clipe lindo!
This video makes perfect sense in today media and steaming society . Young people should not to worry about anything other than having a happy childhood enjoying life getting out meeting people interacting in real-time and no online . We have all lost so much in life and now to lose the simple acting of face to face real life communication it’s very tragic . Thank you again for this video .
This SONG is timeless. It will forever be an anthem of SELF-LOVE, ACCEPTANCE and INCLUSIVITY. Thank you xtina for giving us this classic!
Wow, who was going to say that 20 years ago when I was 4 I heard this song with my mom and I thought it was dedicated to her and now I'm living that reality 💔💔  Christina I'll never forget you because my mother bears your name and you have changed our lives 😭😭
How tf was this released 20 years ago
Buah que fuerte quién iba a decir que hace 20 años cuando tenía 4 escuché esta canción con mi mamá y creía que era dedicada para ella y ahora yo estoy viviendo esa realidad 💔💔  Christina jamás te olvidaré porque mi madre lleva tu nombre y has cambiado nuestras vidas 😭😭
this made me cry. What a world we're living in... 😞
Hermosa canción. Excelente mensaje en el vídeo. El bombardeo de las redes sobre cuerpos hegemónicos es constante. También ahí debe estar la responsabilidad de los padres en enseñar las cosas que realmente importan
Beautiful
Your comment was so well written heart felt and sooooo relatable! I’ve said it once and I’ll keep saying it “stripped” is a masterpiece of an album and songs like “beautiful” will live on as a timeless record for generations to come
Christina Aguilera numer one... My voice... I Love You 💕
okay and why does christina drop a video where she try to be like beyonce or something? didnt she had min 3 sugery ops?
no, ure not gonna bring me down today, not today, not tomorrow, u'll never bring me down cuz im just beautiful for what i am.
SE ARRAZA DEMAIS MINHA FIA ❤
Muito necessário esse relançamento para nossos jovens. Parabéns!
Beautiful saved me, twice now. Thank you, Xtina. 👏
Love it. I needed this. 💚
Bravo!
Forte e maravilhosa como sempre. Obrigado
Es increíble para algunos, fuerte para otros, incluso para algunos es solo una expresión de arte y quizás para un resto un simple video de una artista de la música. Pero es una cruel, pero real expresión de como hoy estamos la humanidad, apegados a una apariencia, a querer ser parte de algo, de un grupo, de una comunidad, de pensamientos e ideas. 😢
:3
EMOCIONANTE !!! ❤
Let's keep our kids away from social media... Guys, please.. youtubers, tiktokers, instagrammers exposing their kids just for likes ... please stop!!! It is not healthy... Also we need to keep yourself healthy for our kids.... Thanks Xtina.... We all agree "Beautiful" is an anthem for us!
I love
Thank you Xtina and Linda Perry for such amazing music. Thanks for saving my life multiple times ❤
I love you Christina
I love you Christina
This is beautiful.  Fantastic
Thank you for using your platform to raising awareness for all these years, this made me cry like a baby 😭
Yeah sorry but words CAN bring people down nice try though.
🎵😎💗
20 years already? Man time flies so d*mn fast 😔 And am still insecure about my self 🥺
Amazing this song is one of the most incredible songs with one of the most incredible voices and artists in history ever #Periodt #Iconic to another level. #xtina I appreciate you so much.
i really felt the black girl screamming at 2:44
I’m thinking we were about to get rebooted vocals… girl literally could have just kept this and put out the old video it’s still relevant and had more heart.
Queen 😍❤️
ดีงามมากแม่ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnQX96wI1Ds
Reminds me of Britney
LOL the video contains only children who look like they could be modelling in a GAP catalogue
Me encantó el mensaje en el vídeo, en estos tiempos nos dejamos llevar x todo lo q vemos en las redes sociales, sin embargo es hermoso vernos y amarnos tal , cuál somos #CristinaAguilera
BOUGHT TIME RICH PEOPLE START STANDING FOR SOMETHING.
Years ago, this song made me embrace my insecurities and helped me loving me for me. Seeing this after video makes me emotional.   Thank you Christina ❤
Putting the kids in front of the kardashians would have been more fitting in this video
This video is so important! This message is pivotal and necessary. Social media is so mean ! Social media boasts on being perfect all awhile making us feel inadequate and just a meanness to fit in ! Can we all go back and be happy in our skin ! We are perfect and beautiful always ! Thank-you so much for reminding us ! Let’s be real and individual and let your beauty shine !♥️🙏
More than ever, we must Do BETTER ❤ #SelfLove
This video hit me even harder than the last one. Thank you Christina
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Dumb that you think it social media is to blame of course photos of the most beautiful are going to be popular, nobody wants to see photos of ugly people that's the reality of existence. Whats your plan stop people from seeing images of the fit and beautiful people  so they don't compare themselves. We all know what the ideal form is more or less.
Thank you christina!  This is more important than  ever
love it omg
Wow! such a good video
Desde hace 20 años hasta ya fecha me sigue ayudando en mis días difíciles
Compared to other pop-stars, Christina Aguilera doesn't get talked about often enough. Makes me kinda wish that she was slightly a bit more popular than she actually is.
I love it
We didnt have any issues like this in 2002 about the torture of the social media on humans. Now the song has another point of view with such a strong public message inside! 💙
I bet you most of those kids still got makeup "touch ups" for their natural look for this video. Thinking about that makes it even more sad.
If men think an attractive women with breasts is all that can make a woman attractive then I don’t want a man. But luckily there are a lot of real men out there you got to find them. Thanks to my Hubby for loving every flaw of me and same as I love him with all his flaws.
I always love the message of this song. We are born beautiful, the only problem is we are born in a judgemental society.
This song is classic
Oryginal was more dynamic and passionfull plus we seen Christina singing.... Here very slow motions not much energy doesn't match to song emotions... And where is Christina... 🥴
This is the most ridiculous song I have ever heard in my life. And it is certainly indicative of postmodernity. You are beautiful in every single way? All that tells me is that there is nothing to strive for, and ambition has no place. According to Christina Aguilera beauty is subjective (along with morality and biology) so what would be the point of striving for anything. Words won't bring her down because words don't mean anything. It's no wonder depression is running rampant in the West. When you take away objective beauty what you're left with is the excrement found hanging on the walls of the modern art gallery in Los Angeles. When you take away objective morality what you're left with or a bunch of unsatisfied people who have been jumping in the sack with whatever. What this post modernity has done is eliminated what is truly sacred and the results can be found everywhere. Thanks a lot Christina Aguilera.
Great video
Well done💖💖💖🌈🌈🌈
*Throw away your smartphones and find "real" friends. Being alone in front of the display on social (?) networks does not indicate intelligence. Forget clicks, likes, bambi-eyes, pouty lips, fake nails and lashes, thigh-gaps, silicone, botox and surgery. Develop your personality and your own style. Wear clothes that you like, that suit you and not because other people wear them. Delete your fake idols, fake friends and be what you are - YOU!*     DON´T dream it - BE IT!
Espectacular!!! Muy bueno!
Pls babygirl come back 2 the basis.  We need ya desperately 🥺💔
Lo más gracioso es que esta cantante a sido uno de los mayores exponentes al culto y adoración de la belleza física.  Dicen y contradicen cuando les conviene!  Y la gente como siempre, ciega detrás de todas estas celebridades.  Escuchen musica indie de artistas tratando de hacer cambios sociales, sin promoción ni popularidad, a puro amor por el arte,  coño!
This anthem never gets old. I still have lots of insecurities within me but with this song - I now know that I'm gonna be alright because I am beautiful inside and out.
Esta canción me acompaño en mi adolescencia y ahora que soy adulto me vuelve a recordar que todos somos hermosos, los estándares de belleza que se vayan al carajo
Always love this song 🤍
I also love (sarcasm) how she pretends she didn’t do this (make us look at ourselves like we weren’t enough) to us back when she actually originally did stripped. The virtue signal is strong
Increíble como la basura vende más que estas joyas !
20 years since I was in high school reacted on this kind of track ..until now I was Soo touched and relate to the song until now thou
Next one Fighter plz
Only the music video is new but it’s same record as old
Watching this got to me almost instantly      the fear I have for my children growing up like this and feeling this way and this being normal is crippling.      What a powerful video
Like her❤
This song never gets old. I remember watching its premiere on MTV back in the day when I was a teen. I'm so happy she's bringing this song back to new generations.
♥
❤️❤️😍 beautiful
Your music will always mean so much to me. You made me realize I deserve to be loved as anyone else does.  Thank you Christina❤️
Pedophilia!! WIERD!!! SICK!! GET RID OF IT!!!
What a beautiful message for this new generation.
En estos tiempos donde todos aparentan ser hermosos y perfectos con sus vidas súper perfectas se ocultan cosas  tristes gracias Cristina Aguilera
Thank you ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
This is a nice song but I feel like she copied TLC unpretty if you look up the video and compare to this one there's a lot of resemblance. As far as the video I kind of don't like it when other artists copy others videos but I do like the song so i have to give her some credit
Yo al principio estaba en la mesa comiendo con el teléfono a lado y con gente, muy mal, pero me dí cuenta de que eso es falta de respeto cuando hay más gente contigo y no lo volví a hacer. Tengo varias redes sociales pero subo cada vez menos cosas, desde la pandemia esta cambié de trabajo y ahora trabajo menos horas aunque gane menos. Prefiero vivir la vida real y que el sistema se joda.
I don't really know this singer but hearing a new love song is almost a miracle nowadays. This deserve a huge hooray congraculation. To all singers; bring back love songs & romantic slow dancing
This was beautiful! Thank You Christina!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Você é pftaaaaaa
This song SAVE MY LIFE when I was in middle School..... THANK YOU for this
Yes! 😢
🙏❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
#women_life_freedom
I honestly prefer the original music video as that has more impact for me in a deeply personal level - with body image, sexuality, and acceptance. And it is still very relevant up to this day even it was release 20 years ago.  But I truly appreciate and understand this video, that this 20y/o song still resonates but now to the newer generation, impacting to even more younger people due to the culture of social media.  It’s so interesting to see the balance and relatability of an older song with the recent and modern issues yet spreading out the same message: that we are beautiful, no matter what they say, and in every single way 💖
😔👏👏👏 what a superb idea to recreate the iconic video. So powerful, so moving
Made me cry
Amazing ❤️ 🙌🏾👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
♡♡ amo este tema ♡♡
Un video impresionante!!! 😍😍 Las  Redes sociales dictan unos estándares de belleza inalcanzables y dañinos que están provocando enfermedades en los jovenes. La música de ahora es una pena sin canciones que hacen reflexionar o te llegan al corazón.  Esta canción de los 00s siempre ha sido bellísima como su título y tiene un mensaje precioso. Ojalá se creara música como esta canción en esta epoca
Regresé a mi antiguo barrio, a esa misma hora solía haber un montón de niños. Ahora la mayoría prefiere estar en casa con el teléfono, me entristeció pensar que en ese mismo lugar solía reír, ver a mis amigos, compartir algún recuerdo. Parece ser que fuimos la última generación en hacer eso. Gracias porque hasta ese tiempo no tuvimos teléfono. Sigo adorando esta canción. Siempre estará en mi repertorio 💜💜
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩❤🇵🇹
This woman is the queen we need more music girl!!
WOW! I don't know how today's youth does it. I'm so grateful this poison wasn't around during my youth. And I'm heartbroken that it has taken over our World. This video is so deep. Thank you for releasing and reminding everyone that we are beautiful.
Disgrace to children, disgusting
Wonderful 👏👏👏
Hold Your Kids and your loves ones Far from Social media. ❤#mentalhealthquotes #fakelife
corny ass video
Me encanta
Diosaa
really? how can you bring back the same song as the same as it was 20 years ago, really? i thought at least to sound a bit different, or at least remix, or at least featuring with another person, if you bring a old song, bring also something different in it, not only change the video...who has the idea to bring again this song as it waas, for me personally doesnt make sense ..is not logic...is no point..is nothing changed...
Back in 2002 , I was only 13 , and you showed me I wasn’t alone , that was possible , that my image was mine and only mine and helped me to love myself ❤you taught  me words are not important if hurts and this song gave me an anthem to use as shelter ! You made me a fighter , you made me feel I’m beautiful and trust in my voice within  Thank you thank you thank you #20yearsOfStripped the album that saved many lives 🥰
Queen 👑
Looking for English comments
🙏🏼Que vuelva la belleza natural, que nos aceptemos tal y como somos🤍
u're beautiful, no matter how many likes u get in that photo.
I am So proud of you Xtina! You make me feel this way again and again ❤️❤️ You are such an inspiration, icon.. all good things 😘 Thank you for keeping inspiring and encouraging the youth (and us who’s been with you for 20+ years) It means Everything!! ❤️❤️❤️
i was expecting a new version of the song but all i got was kids climbing trees and nothing else.
Lyrics:  Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed  I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today  To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?  You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today  No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes  And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side  'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
20 years later.......

Thank you for this message Christina.
Phenomenal. 💥🌟💯🤟🙏
What child grooming shit is this you Should be lock up for this
Omg this video is beaty ,is real
I was 12 when this song came out.  Now 20 years later, look how times have changed.  This video hit the nail on the head.  To all my parents out there, please  continue being involved in our kids lives.    Plant as much wisdom, lessons, information that will help our little ones understand life as it truly is.  So that they may go off into this world 🌎  knowing themselves, loving themselves and finding peace within themselves.
Ok, that’s a really good message…wait, have you seen Christina? 😂 She made lips, face, nose, breast…it’s weird 🙃
Amazing message!
Love Love LOVE.  Sends out the right message. Always loved this song and feel like the message it sent out then is still a message the people need to hear today
This song will forever be exactly that. . . . Beautiful 💜
So beautiful ❤
Incredibly powerful. Thank you 🙏
Wow stunning so emotional
😭😭😭😭😭😭
This song is definitely needed in 2022 😢
I heard this song first time when I was 16 and now I'm 36 .
My Religion!
Great music video for the ny times
Yang kamera sama Lightroom nyindir tiktokers yang kebanyakan skincarean demi konten padahal jadi diri sendiri tanpa skincare juga cantik gitu filosofi nya
When I'm having a bad day, I listen to this song and it makes me feel better.
The world needed this !!
Don't look at me
Thank you, Christina! You made me cry too.
😭😭😭💗💗💗💗
❤️
One of the most talented female artist in our generation. Ms Christian Aguilera is so underrated.  Amazing and brilliant singer. Thank you for sharing this song  for the past 20 years. ❤️
Me quedo con el video original!!
I hope this new versión saves Many lives and help people to pull through like she did 20 years ago🥰,remember You're not alone🙌😘.
Wow this hits so hard. What an amazing video and reminder to simply love who you are ❤
Always one the best songs ever made in our generation. So timy for society's beauty standards and exprctions.
Wow this video is so powerful and inspiring! In todays society and era social media can be so toxic and weigh heavy mentally especially with it being so broad we are exposed to so much, depending on how it’s utilized, this video just helped me to realize even more how important it is to be yourself no matter what, who, or how the next person may feel regardless of what they may be doing themselves it’s so easy to judge and compare yourself to the next which can be so draining however I believe that the key is being yourself and staying true to yourself no matter what! Were are all beautiful in every single way! Just beyoutiful! Thank you Christina! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍❤️‍🔥💓💞
Human Beings can Be Wonderful and Horrific at the same time .Embrace the Beauty in Difference 💜
Using kids as props for political propaganda. Shame on her
I approve the message. Just wish she herself would not give in to Kardashian beauty standards. Less lip fillers and whatever else she has done to herself. Lead by example, Xtina.  Like this, the message loses its power. Sorry.

Omg I’m so so so glad you re released this song queen!!! An incredibly strong message that needs to be heard in this day in age! This song saved me in 2002 😭♥️
Tears again so powerful.
Thank you. 🥰❤️❤️❤️
Hola Christina,me encanto el vídeo y te quiero mucho.
Uh yes! The same beauty standards that Hollywood pushes the hardest, The same Beauty standards pushed by the women who sings this song, Maybe I’d listen to her message if she went against the grain of the cesspool she still resides in and actually aged and presented her self naturally, The irony of It all, the hypocrisy knows no bounds in Hellywood, The most fakest, Vainest, self entitled, self loving hypocritical group of elitists in the world
You are beautiful no matter what they say!!! Eres hermos@ no importa lo que ellos digan!!! Amate como eres ❤️ eres increíble 🤩✨
❤
I appreciate this.  I wish the remake came out sooner. But, I am glad it is here.  I am not happy with what you have displayed in front of children during the recent pride parade however.
Escuche esta canción por primera vez a los 13 ❤❤❤❤❤❤
I danced to this in high school for dance gcse and it has become part of who I am, I love this song and love Christina aguilera ❤️❤️❤️
👏👏👏👏👏
Essa música te leva pra caixinha das memórias!
❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
The most important message for today’s Generation 🥺🤍
thank you xtina for going through the years helping people with your music.  linda is such a strong song, it is capable of changing lives.  thank you for this new clip so beautiful, strong and empowered! ❤️🇧🇷
Ooh I thought to find a new studio version of the song.. Now I hope Christina will do that!
Im not crying.
This is the problem with America
Don't let social media sites and influencers tell or show you who to become, you be you. You don't need botox or liposuction to look "perfect". A lot of those "influencers" don't feel secure in their own skin which is why they use unnecessarily large amounts of botox to look "perfect" I love the way I am personally. I just turned 29 years old, I have never used botox and I never plan to. You are perfect just the way you are.
De una gran canción en el pasado, a una gran tristeza en la realidad cuando existió esta canción antes y después de esta versión
Thank you for doing this for our children. I wouldn't have coped being young today, there is so much pressure to look perfect.
Será sempre um hino. Uma música atemporal MDS!!
LEGENDARY 💖  this message is very important for everybody especially young people who grow with social media influences.
Cryingggggg 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
timeless song
Woooow!
I have mixed feelings about this...1. Im glad she did it   2. She is all "fixed" herself so its a little weird she preach something that dhe didnt follow herself...   and is only a new video doesnt sound like new version
❤
This is something that no one asked for, the original version is enough
Obrigada Christina ♥️
❤ u Christina. U always inspires me .
I prefer the old version, this new version failed to show the true reality of today's standard of beauty and the pressure of the society...
We need to start holding social media companies accountable. They need to be regulated
這首歌總是讓我從低潮中站起來！ love u so much xtina
💚💚
😭❤️
Wow this got a lump in my throat, the things the kids of today worry about that didn't even cross my mind when I was growing up. Excellent video!
Es claro el mensaje y tan atinado en la actualidad: Superficialidad, todos queriendo encajar en los prototipos impuestos de belleza, aparentando una vida cool, inmersos en los celulares, robotizados. Fuera máscaras y brillen por el simple de hecho de SER.
She's singing something dat our mothers often forget to tell us in this generation🥺🥲God bless yu chritina💘
El video original transmitía muchísimas más emociones
Low key cringe
reality in one.video 😢
Yesss!!!! 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽🤝🤝🤝 This is beautiful and 100%fact
BEAUTIFUL!
Thank you for the music!
WERK KWEEN The message still strong still relevant  Yaaaaaaaaasssss
So powerful message. Love you Xtina.
Crying over here. What a powerful video♡
Gracias!
You did it again! Thank you!
So many mixed emotions, Angry, Sad, Happy ECT. 1 thing to make the video better, show the kids playing in all 4 seasons.
This makes me feel hopeful for all the precious ones in this world ❤
Funny when Xtina herself has changed her own appearance, looking worse of course, with those ugly plump lips and fillers that ruined her natural beauty.
Soul will be always soul ♥ love @xtina
1:36 I don't know why I laughed at her neck
#shakirafans apoyamos xttina..adoro TEMAZO 🔥 💕
hace un par de décadas el videoclip fue demasiado fuerte para la sociedad, hoy el mensaje es aun más claro y más fuerte. esta es una canción atemporal. gracias Christina por cantar tan hermoso himno al valor y amor propio!
a paradox that sings about how a person should accept himself and how beautiful we are just the way we are, and she herself, like in this video, is getting botoxed so much that she no longer looks like herself.
Absolutely love! To anyone who sees this: You are loved! You are enough! Don’t let anyone try to convince you otherwise! You are beautiful, gorgeous, pretty, handsome, perfect the way you are. You don’t need to change you. Plastic surgery is huge in todays culture, if you want to do it, do it because you want to not because you feel like you have to in order to look pretty or hot. Look in the mirror every day and tell yourself one thing you love about you. If you need help, please reach out to someone in your life, call a crisis center, the hospital can help. Don’t battle alone, let others help you, tired not burdening them with it.
Ame ! 👏👏
Una de mis canciones favoritas y con la que conocí a Christina
That's a pretty beautiful song, since 2002 til today. ❤️✊️🎵
Even if you do not have muscles or you are chunky. Everyone is beautiful
It's already 20 yrs now.. wow...
This is a dangerous video.Copy right infringement
Me extrane ver tantos comentarios en espanol para una cancion en ingles. 😍 And only Christina can bring an old song to make it "New" for this generation ❤️
Everyone is beautiful.
No 1 . Take the razor out of this video. You are giving young teens ideas of suicide. Shame on you .
This song is so strong. Help me when im feels down and help me to accept me as i am. Thank you XTina.
😍
TE AMO! POR ISSO ANTES E AGORA<3
So so true many of us like adults we should re educated ourselves in order to said positive an  motivation to alll our kids doesn’t matter their age
Meh, yeah...nice, important message, but could have been done with a new creative song, instead of raping the past library for "nostalgia" purposes to get another hit. Reminds me of another artist. 😛 Christina, you're better than this, expected better...do better. You're still too young and talented to be doing this "old" trick.
クリスティーナアギレラ様がそう言ってくれたとしても、バーレスク時代の貴方に魅了された私たちは自分の中のルッキザム美術館からは逃れられないよ…
2:59 always gives me the chills. My cousin gifted me a cassette of Stripped and i listened to the whole album in one night. I was obsessed! Stripped is still so good today, like if she released it today it would still be a hit
👏👏👏👏👏👏🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Beautiful 💟
Amé éste nuevo vídeo!😧❤️👑 Christina Aguilera es La Reina ✅ que gran regalo para lo sociedad es esta canción!❤️
This new generation needs this masterpiece. They have it worst especially the effects of social media, bullying, photoshops and filters. The ideal beauty is becoming more and more unrealistic.
Gracias Christina 💞
Why didnt she come out im it. Missed opportunity 🙄
Ban all peagantry competitons.
❤
Amo!
Es tan hermoso! 🥰🥰♥
Wow this song is so beautiful and I love that's she showing its relevancy even now. It's such a powerful song.
Estuve esperando todo el video a que saliera christina cantando con los niños 🙁 pero ni señales de ella hubo !!
Purely coincidentally I was listening to empowering Christina songs and 12 hours ago a new version of Beautiful was released. How wonderful! I like the on-point commentary about influencers, make-up Tik Toks and plastic surgery. It made me cry. Also, I can't remember the last time I saw kids playing outside. That's really sad.
Thank you 😊 🐇
GRACIAS Christina! Nos estás regalando tesoros! Hermosos tus últimos videos.. Grandes producciones, letras, todo. Gracias de verdad
i love you xtina you r amazing, and the video its perfect, I needed it<3 <3
Fans need a new music video like reflection
POWERFUL MESSAGE.
Thank you for lifting my spirits up since 2002, XTina. ❤️
Beautiful video ....stop plastic surgery n just be yourself
Art that touches hearts ❤
Christina! You done done it again sis. Forever slay my love 😘
Beautiful
Stay childlike, stay unique , stay YOU 🌈
Still one of the most powerful songs ever, thank you Christina ❤️
but look Kylie.... everybody want to be her.. sad...
Love you
This brings back a lot of memories. Thank you, xtina! ❤️
I'm  crying 😢 😭 🤧
Cada vez que escucho esta canción me parece tan poderosa y conmueve hasta la fibra mas profunda de mi ser. Tiene  tan valioso mensaje! Definitivamente hay que ser valiente, amarse y aceptar a todos como quieran ser ❤ Gracias Xtina ❤
timeless ❤
Words tear down or build up....NO INBETWEEN
Me sentía identificado con la versión 2002 y con esta que es más actual, también logra darme esta conexión 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
20 years and this song is not getting older, beautiful message. 💛
Una reinona, muy conmovedor 😢😢
Been waiting for this surprise!! My anthem 20 years ago. I love you xtina!
hey xtina i love this song and i'm very happy that this video has a very strong symbolism, just like what the song talks about i love the old video just like this one with the new outfit and new scenery i loved it.
It’s about time we start raising our voices. Social media is changing our society and our behavior. The next generations will suffer more than our generation is suffering already.
i'm 33 now, i remember the original video from MTV. i was bullied for about 10 years, and that was before anyone had INTERNET. things have improved in a lot of ways but this.... this has gotten so much worse and i feel so bad and guilty for the kids of today. we need to put a stop to this, if you have kids look after them and tell them they are enough, we need to constantly call out this pressure to look pretty or whatever, constantly challenge it and reject it. it has gotten so much worse.
i wish you can sing and make more independent songs for us who need motivated from your song.. i wish u can consider it for us. we really appreciate this song.
Classical hit! should’ve re-recorded with your mature voice if you had the time !! :)
Esse vídeo foi muito importante pra mim, a muitos anos , espero que seja pra nova geração
Yessssss
This is just some random video
I will never forget that gay kiss at the SHINE-YE-YEAH-YE-YEAH-YEAHHHHHHHHHH in the original version.
Not as iconic as the original one.
This song make me cry when was lanced. Today make me cry with this video and message. Tks Christina for create a amazing video. In 2019 I try suicide and today I know that the life is important. The social networking should be to help the people, but destroy because create fight, brutalities , fatalities and violence for all the places. I’ll wait that the people love more and celebrate the life. While the hate keeping on the world, more bad things will go happen!
this is beautiful
hino
This is so emotional 🥺🥺
Thank you Christina
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 the key message is perfect !  We need to “Back to basics”  and love ourself … this new era is not the better moment
Omg omg omg. Just what I need.  After 20 years. I love you Xtina. Your songs are very uplifting.
why am i crying, damn. Good job christina
Absolutely love this video!
Cuando tenía 16 años, no la cantaba, la gritaba porque ayudó mucho al ser una niña no popular en el colegio y por momentos pensaba que me faltaba algo, pero beautiful llegó y eso cambió, luego sacaste fighter y me hizo fuerte.. thanks Cristina a nombre de muchas...
Me hubiera gustado que realmente fuera una versión 2022 con el audio,  de todas formas no deja de ser una canción muy linda pero del 2002
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Que precioso mensaje para la nueva juventud 💜💜💜💜💜💜
needed! yes!     wattpad mary_bree for kimpossible and She-ra fan fics!
This is what the world needs right now (one of a few things to start with).
❤❤, Beautiful original is favorite MTV, and new version also really nice!
Omg thanks for this ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Qué HERMOSURA, de vídeo, siempre será significativa la letra, eres una REINA Christina ♥️♥️♥️
Xtina 💚💛🇧🇷
La amé amé amé
Solo lloro y lloro de nuevo con esta canción pero finalmente sonrío.
POWERFUL.NECESSARY.TIMELESS. I LOVE YOU XTINA!
Love this version more. ❤
❤🤌🏻
A very well-produced video clip Christina! 😍
te song is powerful and this new video is meaningful, inspiring and beautiful. Thank u Xtina  🤍💖❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤
What about the black vending machine girl…..
A song with everlasting relevancy 🌹
This video is as intense as the original one. Embodies perfectly what the song is about, insecurities struggles and how they evolved in these last years (especially through social medias). Thank you Christina for bringing attention to these topics by a sort of re-release of this incredible song by releasing this new touching video. 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
Wow...20yrs ago speed fast till now this is still an inspirational piece. xoxo Thank U @ChristinaAguilera and @LindaPerry <3
Quase tirei minha vida na adolescência por não querer ser do jeito que eu era, ainda bem que parei para assistir seu clipe, 20 anos depois estou em um outro momento difícil da minha vida, e mais uma vez sua música faz sentido, obrigado Aguilera.
"Beautiful" was, is, and will always be the best song of my life. For 20 years it has reminded me about how important self-love is, so I listen to this everytime I feel lost. Then I'm not lost anymore ❤ Thank you, Xtina! I love you
Iconic song. Did a lot of me as a kid. Cute video but the original 2002 version is better and more emotional.
This video is so important!!!!!!
amo essa música ❤🇧🇷
música linda ❤🇧🇷
Los niños de ahora no disfrutan su infancia por estar pegado a las redes y los video juegos. Eso es un grave problema.
Muy lindo pero ellos mismos, los artistas, fomentan la busqueda de la "perfeccion" en sus redes, videoclips y demas. Creo que todo el mundo baja el mensaje de "aceptarse como sos" pero de la boca para afuera. Todos posan, usan filtros, se maquillan y no digo que este mal, porque es en general como sociedad, solo hablo de la doble moral. El famoso Has lo que yo digo no lo que yo hago. Me incluyo, no es hate.
que video tan acertado para estos tiempos!! grande!!
Hermoso y fuerte a la vez, Chistina diosa total.
Una canción muy poderosa por siempre ❤✊🏼👊🏽
#Beautiful Soul
<3
Wow. This made me cry. So beautiful
Song beautiful is that true now. Nice for remake. Love forever love alots
*This song is a pure auditory wonder and above all a beautiful message. 20 years in my ears, but still as much pleasure with each listening* 🙏🏼🤍✨
Chorando horrores 😢
Most beautiful. Thank you so much for helping most valued children and teens
Cette chanson est une pure merveille auditive et surtout un beau message. 20 ans dans mes oreilles, mais toujours autant de plaisir à chaque écoute 🙏🏼🤍✨
El mensaje sobre la sociedad actual  es poderoso !
Uffff I needed this
this song is so empowering, thank you for this, we are all beautiful, no matter what. We have to learn to love ourselves and not stick to any pre manufactured image that we see in the media
Masterpiece🥺👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Thank you, Christina... As relevant today as 20 years ago, if not more 💖💖💖
Desde Paraguay MI REINA ADORADA te Amo Gracias por el Poderoso Mensaje ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
This song still gives me the same feeling it gave me all those years ago... Thanks for the remake, love it ❤️❤️
Don’t need to even start the video to know it’s amazing
2022 Youtube Kids Version
Beautiful!
I felt seen. I felt loved. I felt understood.  Stopped was a defining album for me. It took the passing of time. I’m so satisfied I’m here.
ME QUEDO CON LA ORIGINAL
Me emociona como la primera vez que la escuche. Gracias, Christina♥
bealtiful, bealtiful, bealtiful
Christina eu tô chorando aqui
감사합니다 ❤ 나의 영원한 워나비 클스
Thank you Christina for this amazing Video 🙏🏼🙌🏼 Ich hope most of the new generation will be understand your message!!
So cute so beautiful 😍😍💯❤️
Essa música foi importante pra mim assim como pra muitas pessoas.
Musica atemporal.
E ainda toca como se fosse a primeira vez. 🥺❤️
Its such a shame, what was wrong with the way Christina looked when she first came out. So many celebrities ruin their image when they look nothing like themselves anymore.
Que lindo, chorei 😭
Una cantante bella por dentro y por fuera ! Gracias por la inspiración !❤
Your record changed my life a few years ago, thank you so much ❤
Perfecta para estos tiempos en los que creemos que la belleza está en el número de likes en una foto...
Omg.. I'm speechless. It's so real. I feel alone everyday in this current world.
💔
💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
I hope one day U could read and get know how many lives this Song have saved. Included mine. Love u💖🛐
20 anos meu Deus ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So beautiful, and so important to our children. Thank u xtina
Me hizo llorar 😭😭😭 Dios, espero que podamos ser más responsables con las redes sociales y eso no determine quiénes somos en realidad. Gracias Christina por este llamado de atención 🙏
Can you do Come on Over 2022
saludos desde Colombia ❤️
Social media....is a monf#$k
This song is never- ending goosebumps inducer😭😭…TIMELESS and ICONIC
This song helped me to look in the mirror and appreciate myself for the beautiful being that I, We all, are.
Definitivamente Christina  esta en su mejor momento ..❤️
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🥲
Canción vigente en estos tiempos! De tanta plasticidad. Buena reflexión. Para querer al resto del mundo debemos comenzar por quererrnos y creer en nosotros mismos.. para poder ver el mundo mejor
Amo cada parte❤
Esta canción es hermosa, en sus inicios y actualmente, Beautiful me enseñó muchas cosas, pero me quedo con la versión del 2002.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Un himno para las personas que aprendimos a querernos tal y como somos 🥰🥰🥰
👏👏👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
MUSICA ICONICA LEGGENDA
I love you so much Xtina! ♥️ Your music has been so inspirational & such a gift for me through some of the most difficult years of my life discovering myself as a trans person. You’ve always inspired me to be myself & be proud & be a fighter! You are an absolute queen. 👑
This song will forever be relevant.
I still prefer the original video but I like this one too.
Xtina is Xtina.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thanks for speaking up.. you bring current social issues to this vid that most of u forget abt it. We love you! Ohh anyway,, come to South East Asia for tour pls 😅❤
thanks Christina
I'm in tears.  you gave the strength since the first time than I saw the first version of this song.
Don't look at me  Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain I'm so ashamed  I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today  To all your friends you're delirious So consumed in all your doom Trying hard to fill the emptiness The pieces gone, left the puzzle undone Is that the way it is?  You are beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring you down, oh no You are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring you down, oh no So don't you bring me down today  No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes  And everywhere we go (And everywhere we go) The sun will always shine (The sun will always, always shine) And tomorrow we might wake on the other side  'Cause we are beautiful no matter what they say Yes, words won't bring us down, no, no We are beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring us down, oh, no So don't you bring me down today  Ooh-oh-oh, yeah Don't you bring me down today Yeah, ooh Don't you bring me down Ooh, today
¡Arte! 😍
me gusta mucho musica y la voz de Christina Aguilera, pero no entiendo como con el video se quiere dar un msj, en el q no se necesita ser perfecto, por ej ( ni retocarse la cara, u operarse el cuerpo para ser perfecto/a) y la cantante hace todo eso qu en este video se menciona como incorrrecto :/
You are my hero since 2002... I love you so so so so so much Christina..♥️
MAHAL KITA CHRISTINA AGUILERA!!
mother omg
lo entiendo todo
Stripped is xtina best album ever!
Gracias Christina 👏
You are looking for an ENGLISH COMMENT :P BTW, this song is so iconic and great. It came out on a time where gayness is looked down upon and Xtina is only one of the few who is brave enough to explore this subject at a time and did not hold back because she is all about giving a great cause.
Senti o impacto.
Queen!!! Proud to be a fighter
A classic. Timeless.
20 años después esta canción sigue teniendo un gran poder por el mensaje que nos brinda. Gracias Christina por recordarnos de lo que estamos hechos y aceptarnos tal cual. Gracias por este nuevo video, enseñando la realidad de nuestra sociedad hoy en día. Debemos de realizar ese cambio y enfatizar más la salud mental en todos nosotros.
I love you, Christina😍🥰😘.
❤️💋♥️💓💕
When you make even better what was already better!
Hino atemporal. Todo amor para você, Cristina. ❤️
Icono
The song that makes me believe in myself
Army of woman that was forced into makeup and work for that demon X that’s what I see when I see this a world of disgusting people and has anyone done a background check on any of the children used in this video smh 🤦🏻‍♀️
We love you, Xtina!
Freaking saved my life back in 2002 to now omy God I love you girl
Bravo... i want a spanish version of Beautiful
Volvi a sentir algo muy fuerte en mi, gracias Xtina por este regalo maravilloso
O clipe antigo acho muito mais marcante que esse, infelizmente a própria indústria hoje propõe um padrão de como ser ( beleza, corpo, etc).  Este só mostra como as pessoas estão buscando por beleza, mas a própria indústria vive de plásticas, procedimentos, sustentando uma superficialidade! Acho que seria muito melhor como antes, o clipe mostrando o gordo, o negro, o branco, o gay, o hétero, um clipe mostrando que ainda podemos ser quem somos, sem que a sociedade nos julgue!
♥️☺️
yasssssssssssssssssssss👑
Está canción es inmortal, cada vez creemos ser más inclusivos pero la verdad es que esperamos demasiado de los demás y aún mas de nosotros mismos.
B E A U T I F U L
MI HIMNO, MI FUERZA, MI REFUGIO ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hopefully this helps the new generation just how it helped the last ❤️
I cried! But im a fighter now
love always 💖 ❤️ 💕 💗 💓  Great theme for us  no matter what they say
I used to cry in middle school when this was on kids bop, my 29 year old self still cries to this today, the media has made this worse over the years, we need more reality and more truth and the world needs to realize that those older than them are deeply flawed too, the people who have created our society are so flawed - its time to rewrite history and wellness and beauty coming from within and realizing everyone is beautiful and at all stages of life - the surgeries have got to stop
❤❤❤
Thank you for this. Thanks for use your stuning voice for good things. We love you.
No nos vengas a dar lecciones de moral mamita si tenes otra cara, cuantas cirugias te hiciste absurdah
I love you ❤️ you are best person your vocal range  are fire 🔥
Essa música 🎶 foi tudo pra mim na Adolescência!!
No matter what we do (No matter what we do) No matter what we say (No matter what we say) We're the song inside the tune (Yeah) Full of beautiful mistakes
Te amo 💙 hermosa
💔 I cant😭 Beautiful 💝 it's been a long road to healing and I'm still here 😊💓 love you to any one who is hurting your not alone I know your pain.
Love
Que canción tan memorable!!! Gracias por existir Cristina ♥️
This song is timeless ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ we are beautiful
Años atrás fue un himno para la comunidad y hoy es también un himno de la aceptación, xtina gracias por volvernos a compartir tu arte, me llega mucho.
Hace 20 años que lloró cuando escucho está canción
Hace 20 años yo estaba por cumplir la mayoría de edad, todo un jovensuelo deseoso de ser feliz, de descubrir el mundo maravilloso del cuál idealice durante mi niñez, me di de frente con la realidad cuando ví que ese mundo era un caos, lleno de prejuicios, de señalamientos, de violencia escolar, violencia doméstica, en fin, violencia en todas sus formas.  Justo en ese momento donde yo no encontraba mi camino, donde sentir algo por una persona de tu mismo sexo era un delito, un crímen y casi, casi te excomulgaban, todos me señalaban y me tachaban de lo peor, literal, ya estaba empezando a olvidar mi nombre real y me empezaba a acostumbrar que me llamaran por todos los apodos ofensivos de ese entonces, me miraba al espejo y no me reconocía, no era ese mi reflejo, no saben en el abismo sin fin en el que empecé a caer, empecé con una confusión mental, no sabía realmente para dónde ir, el único lugar seguro era "casa" ahí podía ser "yo" sin prejuicios y sin linchamiento social, pero también hubo integrantes de la familia que me hirieron y me aislé y empecé a crear un escudó irrompible de protección, un escudó dónde NADIE iba a pasar sin que yo lo permitiera, me volví resentido, rencoroso y hasta cierto punto vengativo con todos aquellos que me hicieron daño y de algo si estaba seguro, que nadie absolutamente NADIE me volvería a lastimar con sus palabras llenas de odió y de rencor hacia mi, intente acabar con mi vida, cobardemente pense que era la solución a mis problemas, la LUZ me encontró y ya NADIE me haría llorar más, ya NADIE más me haría sentir mal, ya NADIE más me volvería humillar.  Hoy después de 20 años todo quedó atrás, hoy Soy una nueva persona y me olvide del resentimiento, de la venganza, del rencor y del dolor, hoy vivo plenamente y trato de ser mejor persona día a día, obviamente todos tenemos errores y creó que nunca dejaré de cometerlos, no trato de ser perfecto, trato de ser mejor en cualquier aspecto y cuesta, cuesta mucho, los cambios no son de la noche a la mañana y seguiré evoluciónando como Pokémon, seguir cometiendo errores no hacé saber por dónde ya no pasar!   #christinaaguilera #xtina y está hermosa canción #Beatiful son y seguirán siendo una fuente de inspiración y fortaleza hacía mi persona, está canción fué uno de los anzuelos para empezar a salir del abismo en el que estaba perdido ya hace tiempo, hoy empiezo a ver la luz y pese que luego se torna un poco gris y oscura mi vida, se como iluminarla, con una GRAN SONRISA, MUCHA SEGURIDAD y MUCHO POSITIVISMO!!!!  Gracias por leerme 🥹🥹🥹🥹!!!!   La vida es hermosa, tu eres hermos@ y maravillos@, si alguien dice lo contrario da la espalda y sigue tu camino, somos hermos@s y no importa lo que los demás digan!!!  YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY!!!!!!  🥺😢🥲🙂☺️
🥺💔❤👍
Gracias, mi reina, por atreverte a tocar temas de los q pocas personas se comprometen...me ví reflejado y fue imposible contener mis lágrimas 🤪❤️🔥😭😭
The Best Classic! Amazing!💕
Amo 💜
This video suck, there was nothing special about this video. There was not unique black kid going through a racist issue, a Muslim wearing her hijab, a trans kid going through change, a kid fighting cancer, a Chinese kid being bullied, Native American kid not being accepted in the community… etc This video could have done better
You are inspiration! !
Slayed~
Still .😭
Una canción hermosa! nunca pasará de moda, te sube los ánimos!!
🥺🥺 this is why I love you! 💗
Tan sensible y tan actual 😢 con un gran mensaje... Así pasarán otros 20 años ya es un himno a los que crecen con ideas y estereotipos tan absurdos 🤷🏽‍♂️
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😍🧍🏼‍♀️🙅🏼‍♀️
que atualização incrível ♥️
It’s so crazy how social media has a big impact on everyone from the youngest to the oldest person 😢😢😢
me emociona como se fosse a primeira vez que estivesse ouvindo 💗
Gran mensaje...
Amo pacas ❤
20 years later and it still makes me cry. I came out around this time and Stripped was my therapy. Thank you, Christina! You are and forever have been a light in a sometimes dark world. God always bless you.
Se vuelve a repetir…
Lo repito ya no hay originalidad, solo refritos
Hino atemporal 😍❤️🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Xtina is perfect
La cancion mas hermosa que he visto y super real ojala que nuestros chicos sigan siendo reales y autenticos cada uno con su sello y su toque.
Hermosa, es inspiración, motivación, es real! 👏🏻 gracias Xtina! ❤
Gracias Xtina por esto, recordarme al igual que en el pasado que somos hermosos, por esa fuerza 💪 gracias por recordarme porque soy un #Fighter
La canción perfecta para un mundo imperfecto, Xtina Queen ✨
This song is an Anthem…. “Anthem”….
This record will live is this world forever.
La forma en que se adaptó el mismo mensaje a la generación más joven es sublime y poderoso. Gracias por recordarnos que somos hermosos sin importar lo que digan.❤️
Esta canción significa tanto para mi. Y lo difícil que fue afrontar mi adolescencia. Gracias Xtina, diste Fuerza  a Muchos 😢 💪🏻
Thanks Cristina!!! Regresé al 2002, y wow!!!!😘😘
Still one of my favourites after all these years!
😍😍😍😍😍
😍😍😍
This is ironic considering all the plastic surgery she's had.
I love you and all... Since your first album... Up to your recent spanish one... But the way you have butchered your body since 2002 kinda goes against the message you trynna sell us girl...  You should have left this song and video in 2002.... You LITERALLY just added cell phones to this reimagining...
My still my favorite singer 😍😍
I like this version better than the original because I don’t have to see her pushing her gay agenda on the world.
❤❤❤❤
💕💕💕
❤❤❤
espero que este video llegue a muchos jóvenes
And still, the whole Stripped album is a dope, a beautiful healing since then.
We didn’t need or ask for this, where is the new English album??
Essa música significa muito pra mim e para muitos fãs da Christina 🥺❤
You're Beautiful bae ♥ grande Christina
Esta era, es y seguirá siendo una canción que llega al alma y con un mensaje tan hermoso. Amo el video. Gracias Christina por este tipo de canciones. ❤️🙌🏼
Im sorry but how disingenuous was that signposting to her website for info on mental health? Just comes across as a sales ploy dressed up as something admirable. If it was genuine she would've signposted to the American Psychiatric Association, CDC or NHS. But no, she couldn't miss out on the opportunity for add on sales by making sure you seek help by navigating her site with all its music and merchandise on offer. What a heart! 🙄 Other than that nice video 🤣
This song is life changing and life saving
I struggled with BP-II or Bipolar II Disorder when I was 20 years old even I have Autism Spectrum Disorder. I got triggered my anger, sobing and crying because of my body image and mental health and I was attempted suicide several times. And now, I am slowly recover and practicing Catholic faith like attending Holy Mass, apostolic works (i.e. Legion of Mary) and praying some Catholic prayers (i.e. Holy Rosary, chaplets, etc.) to heal my mental health and sad emotions. Gracias Christina Aguilera for that song.
You truly are a good person. Thank you for using your voice, you have saved my life from depression and drug addiction in the past and I hope your music continues helping those who feel there is no hope left because life is beautiful now that I live a clean life and I get to truly love and care for myself.
This album is everything. We need more xtina from this style. It’s greatly missed and needed in the market today. I mean Xtinas voice is always needed.
Un video con un mensaje asi solo #Mireina lo podía sacar... I Love Mi Reina 💕
thank you!!!
I love this. Definitely brought tears to my eyes. Kids shouldn't have to worry about body image. The ending with all the kids playing outside. Really hit. Kids don't do that these days. They're so wrapped in their phones and it's toxic. Way to get the message across.
Wow que hermoso mensaje
Im gonna cry
❤❤
DIANE WARREN DESERVE A SONG OF THE YEAR GRAMMY FOR THIS MEGA BALLAD THAT TELLS A TRUE STORY BUT YOU ALL KNOW HOW TOXIC GRAMMY IS RIGHT,THEY NOMINATED THE SONG AND LET HER PERFORM BUT SHE'S STILL LOSE THE SONG OF THE YEAR CATEGORY😫😫😫THIS IS THE EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE GREATEST SONG EVER WRITTEN IN MUSIC HISTORY 👍👍
Uhm.. Same voice? But different video clips?
Crying just like I did the first time I heard it 20 years ago. Thank you, for modernizing the video, though your voice is the most beautiful voice I've ever heard & forever timeless! xox
POWERFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ok pero siento que esto es doble moral, más aún cuando la propia Christina se operó los senos, antes del mismo disco que lleva esa canción (Stripped). Eso del "amor propio" como está de moda lo usan como marketing.. Ojalá realmente ayude a personas que si necesitan eso. 🙄
why is this making me cry so hard. hits so hard even after 20 years
Christian Aguilera a pesar de lo qué pasó nunca se vio medita en escándalos, entre ellos consumo de drogas y eso. No es de donde vienes, si no de a donde nos está llevando este mundo retorcido.
Stripped forever 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍
Me inspiras siempre lo haz hecho 💪🏾, esto no es una canción es un himno 🙌🏾🌍❤️
Me emocioné como cuando vi el video en su primera versión. Allá por los 2002's esta canción me ayudo demasiado a aceptarme.  Gracias por eso Xtina!
This song is so strong as well the video, sadly it reflects the way now youth is living and growing!!
But XTina has fillers and botox 😂😂😂
Gracias Xtina por esta joya! Hace 20 años me hiciste saber que no importaba lo que los demás dijeran de mí! Me hiciste creer lo que soy y que era  hermoso! El verdadero arte jamás muere , gracias gracias y mil veces gracias por esta canción... Me salvaste de mil y una maneras,  el disco Stripped lo es todo !
OMG, a song can hurt twice, this video Is amazing, Xtina ur the best, the socialmedia turns in a enslaving monster
Impossível não se emocionar com essa música....
Let kids be kids 🥹🤍
Love this song
The most you can go without giving your child a phone the better. Their developing minds cant event comprehend what goes on social media
Bravo Christina  this version of the  video is the best and the other version is very good with different meaning of course.
The irony, no shade ,but didn't she get a bunch of surgery and then claim we are beautiful no matter what?
Chorei, gente 😢 Ficou muito perfeito
So painful  😖
Hermoso ❤️💜😢
😇😇😇😇😇😇
Make wave to movie and pageant peeps.
I love Christina
Ameiii i love Christina Aguilera
You Made Me Cry... I love U my Queen ...
The POWER of this SONG! 🥹🥰👏💪
🌱🌿🍂💕
Es de los vídeos mas hermosos y reales que he visto, gracias Christina Aguilera.
Love the message you are sending in this video, children need to be children again. ❤❤
Amare estas cancion por siempre ❤
Esta canción es realmente mágica, hace 20 años ayudó a todas las personas a aceptarse tal cual son y a su vez darse cuenta de lo hermosos que son, a apreciar la belleza de cada uno, que siempre existe. Hoy, 20 años después, nos damos cuenta que no sólo sigue vigente, si o que además estuvo bastantes adelantada, el mensaje es más grande y extenso de lo que creemos, que hoy en día es más fuerte que nunca. Gracias CHRISTINA AGUILERA 👑❤️
Hino atemporal!
So beautiful message is this era. Thanks you xtina #foreverbeautiful
Chorei em 2002 e chorei em 2022 tbm! 😢❤
20 años después sigue siendo icónica esta canción 👏
Christina salvó muchas vidas.
La canción desde hace 20 años es una belleza, la pieza clave ahora es el vídeo, que no se dobla frente al mensaje... Los niños aprenden a disfrutar esa etapa. Aceptación.
Dios Santo me encanta esta canción desde que salió, gracias Cristina,😘💕
🙌🏻
2022 😭📱
Esta canción me ha salvado la vida cuando sólo era un niño.
Esta canción significa tanto para mi, hoy día después de 20 años sigue tan vigente como el primer día que la escuche. Es una letra tan poderosa y acompañada de esta increíble voz y pasión. Gracias Xtina por seguir llevando un mensaje positivo, de aceptación y amor a todos ❤❤❤❤.
Queen 🔝🔥📈🎤🎶🗣️💯💪😭🤩👏#20YearsOfStripped 💞🙌✨
I thought Christina would sang on the video , otherwise wonderful video also too
Amo❤️
Love ❤️
I'm crying . This song is amazing !
👍 muito bom
🤔  Is it misinformation if someone says "She was 12, he was Joe Biden... I mean 30."?  👈🏿 hmmmm
Sem dúvida a canção mais linda do mundo. Pra sempre. Te amo Xtina! 🤍
Eu descobri o que é amor próprio após assistir a primeira versão de Bautiful. Simplesmente mudou minha percepção de mundo e hoje sou feliz comigo mesmo graças à sua arte. Tatuei Fighter nas costas para que eu nunca me esqueça que sou um lutador E VENCEDOR  Você foi, é e sempre será minha maior inspiração! Eu te amo Christina Aguilera! <3 <3 <3
Thank you Xtina, happy 20th anniversary Stripped
👏👏👏
Soooo needed ❤🥹🌸
Siempre amé esta canción en mi adolescencia, ahora la amo más con este video que tanto hacía falta, una justa crítica a la sociedad actual. Bravo, Christina, cada vez te reinvindicas como artista y persona.
Dont look at me
Better than the 1st video
Can you do a Spanish version of this? 🥺👉👈
20多年了，坚持激励着我们，感谢你为少数群体的发声。20年前的社会文化还不够开放时，你就挺身而出，用你的音乐激励着每一个人，而不是消费性少数群体，你的善良你的爱在你的音乐和艺术中永续！感恩这个世界有你🇨🇳
Está canción deberá a volver a salir en el 2042 para ver cómo sigue la humanidad, cada 20 años ha ávido cambios y no me gustaría saber a qué males les espera a estás generaciones que ya tendrán unos 30 años
Beautiful song and video… but the artist does not represent the concept 😢
Happy to see this remake. Hope this masterpiece can pass on and spread among the new generation via this
The old video was one of the best I've ever seen. This one is is just as good.
i miss this christina !!!!!!!
What if my little was hurt
Same here crying  again in 2022. Thank you my queen
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ queen
aaaaaa toda la vida ame esa cancion
Crying again
Perfecto para la época.
The only thing I'm tryna change about myself is my hair line 😅😅😅😅 but this is correct. You're beautiful the way you are. Just not me haha
thank you Christina
Tagging the Kardashians
So what is supposed to be new about this 2022 version? I didn't hear any new vocals or runs added or removed on the song. It's just a new video for the song.
Truly inspiring. 🥰🥰🥰
Me encantó. Sería genial si Christina sacara una versión de esta canción en español, el mensaje llegaría a muchos más niños y adolescentes del mundo. 💟
Esta versión de Beautiful sin duda alguna muestra lo que se vive en la actualidad y todo lo que se perdio a lo largo del tiempo.
20 years of these song is still strong meaningful and inspiration all time. Never get old. And it’s my fav song of all time for sure.
Damn. This is an old song I’ve known for years and I didn’t expect it to make me cry now as an adult.
It's Incredible for today
I love this song, I remember went listening in 2002!
Excelente representación de lo que se vive en estos tiempos modernos.
genia!
Love love you for this new vision of a classic anthem for so many of us ❤❤❤
A message so important and one that resonates so much louder these days  😔🥺
You are beautiful in every single way...  🎶🎶🎶  Every day is so wonderful Then suddenly, it's hard to breathe Now and then I get insecure From all the pain, I'm so ashamed...   🎶🎶🎶THANKS Christina Aguilera
So beautifull , the Best
❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
Amazing ❤️
I love you ❤
I cried the first time I watched the original video and 20 years later, this one made me cry again. The message of this song is so powerful that any generation can relate to it. Thank you Christina and Linda Perry for telling me through a song what I needed to hear at 14 and now at 34.
Essa música me salvou da minha adolescência. Eu odiava meu rosto, minhas pernas, minha altura. Foram muitos momentos em que cantava Beautiful para me acalmar de crises de choro. Obrigada!
Imaginen cuántos corazones de diferentes generaciones están conectando y sanando la vida con este poderoso mensaje. Gracias Christina ❤️
I am beautiful in every single way “ I am still feeling as it was 2003 when I first listened to this song .
When this song came out in 2002, I was only in 6th grade and suffered with my self-esteem. This song made me start accepting who I was and today I am grateful for it. Thanks for bringing this song back for the younger generation.
A música segue intocável
Christina makes music with purpose, this is what sets her apart from other artists. Thank you so much, X.
🥺🥺😍😍😍👏👏👍
Antes y después del instagram
Mamãe sempre necessária 🥺❤️✨️
Hoy volví a escuchar y ver “Beautiful” como la primera vez ❤️
Be just who you are, because you are beautiful in every single way... That's NOT a lie! I am beautiful in every single way too, but just in case I'll have botox, lip fillers, face lift, Brazilian butt lift, breasts implants, and about 100 more surgeries. -Celebrities.
I love you Christina.
This is a sad reality😢💔
hino.
Literalmente, CADA vez que repito esta canción, toda mi piel muestra la cantidad de sentimiento que transmite esta canción.
Me encanto
Cuando salió el tema ,yo estaba confundido con mi sexualidad,  y me.sentia solo y extraño , que linda canción
This song means so much to so many of us. This album was a burning bush for many of us. I know it helped me through some dark times. I don’t think I would be the person that I am today if I hadn’t had her music in my life. That’s how impactful she is as an artist. And it’s no wonder it has stood the passing of time.  We love you, Christina.
Excelente mensaje! Christina nunca decepciona, es una verdadera artista. 😍🥰👑❤️✨
we need a "Stripped Album" Part 2
ESTA CANCION SALIO EN EL 2002 CUANDO IBA EN LA SECUNDARIA Y ME HACIAN BULLYNG POR SER GAY AL ESCUCHARLA ES UN HIMNO AL DECIRTE ERES HERMOSO NO IMPORTA LO QUE DIGAN
Mi “yo” de los 12 años está llorando y feliz de lo grande y acertado que fue de elegir a Xtina como inspiración. Hoy a mis 32 años estoy feliz con lo que soy y no necesito respuestas a preguntas que en ese entonces me atormentaban. Gracias Xtina, eres y serás siempre mi fuente de inspiración y de amor ❤️.
A real love anthem..now and then. Thank you
Tenía 15 años cuando vi por primera vez el video, christina llego a cambiar mi vida  ha sido gran inspiración para salir adelante en todo.
I love you Christina!
👑
Piel erizada  Simplemente gracias Gracias Gracias
Nada como la versión original, esa si transmite ❤
So true what it says here at the end, but nothing is better than the original. The original imagery and video it's timeless as it is!!!
♥️♥️♥️♥️
34 years old this past September, haven't used social media in over 4 months and don't miss it, free yourselves and be your best self! xoxo
I am beautiful no matter what they say Words can't bring me down I am beautiful in every single way Yes, words can't bring me down, oh no So don't you bring me down today
20 años despues y este tema sigue siendo poderoso, liberador e imponente. Alimenta el alma o todo aquello que llevemos por dentro y que lo consideremos nuestra escencia.
Tuvimos el privilegio de estar presentes en esta nueva versión de una canción que es un clásico de Christina Aguilera👑
Such a new meaning in 2022♥️ still as powerful as 20 years ago 🙏🏼 beautiful video
💙💙💙💙💙
Christina logra demostrar que nunca va a perder su esencia a pesar del tiempo, una gran exponente del amor propio y una reina totalmente incondicional 💓💫
Always great to hear this emotional song
La cantidad de respeto que tengo por esta mujer es indescriptible. Ella es tan fuerte, única e insuperable. Nunca me canso de sus canciones ❤‍🔥
Beauty is everything ❤
So so important✨
#GreatVersion #2022 ... #ILoveIt
Take that Britney 💅🏻😘
❤❤❤❤❤
Powerful song 20 yrs ago. Stronger message 20 yrs later. <3 <3 <3
To say that Stripped saved my life is an understatement and I honestly wasn't expecting to cry watching this but I did. This song is still as powerful as it was when I first heard it 20 years ago ♥️
Beautiful song beautiful message beautiful voice ! ❤
Chorei de novo, de novo e de novo. Há muitos anos essa música me emocionou e agora é como se eu tivesse ouvindo pela primeira vez. Esse vídeo não poderia ser melhor, obrigada Xtina por entender nossa dor e transformá-la em arte, através dela percebi que não tem nada de errado em ser "imperfeita" ❤️
we are beautiful
Yo creo que Dios nos hizo perfectos,únicos y hay que amarnos nosotros mismos sino quien más lo haria,(no discriminar rasgos fisicos)que lo único que importa son los buenos sentimientos de la persona..
Preciosa 💖 💎
Gracias por el mensaje 🙏 Amamos tu voz y te admiramos desde argentina Santa Fe ❤
Los grandes mensajes no saben del tiempo🤍
🤧😭😭🤧😭😭
The originals is better, but this is wonderful
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
My all time favourite singer Christina Aguilera..
Ya era hora de pasar esta joya a las nuevas generaciones que lo necesitan más que nosotros.
Medio un escalofrio esta canción me salvo mile sde veces y ver esta nueva versión, dios, este año Christina eres la reina me dejas mudo, han pasado años y esta canción me deja al borde de las lagrimas
Es la misma canción posta ? Esperaba más
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is truly beautiful and message we all need today ❤️
Waooo the meaning of this video is so powerfull
En 2002 cette chanson avait tellement compté pour moi et de voir qu en 2022 elle pourra sûrement aider d autres jeunes qu ils comprennent qu’ils sont beaux quoiqu’ils ou pensent ou disent ! ❤
Me faltó Xtina 2022 en este video
Hermoso recordarle a los niños lo bello que es la vida, lindo video
🥺😭🖤
himno !!!! we love u
Iconic !! ❤️
Fabulous! 🌟💙
Gracias❣️
Hermoso me encanta Reina 👑 gracias por compartir tu música te amooo Reina 👑 soñada Christina Aguilera ♥️♥️
Lo volvió a hacer la reina! Hace 20 años habló de la belleza que nadie quería hablar pero que todos necesitabamos tocar; hoy nuevamente vuelve a tocar los temas de los que nadie se atreve; y expone nuevamente la belleza desde el amor! En este caso el amor propio y el autorrespeto
Hoy en día, los jóvenes no saben luchar contra las imposiciones de la sociedad, en cuanto a la estática física; y en Redes sociales están extremadamente expuestos al bombardeo. Este video es el mejor regalo que Christina Aguilera puede hacerle a esta nueva generación, el mensaje más hermoso para los jóvenes expuestos y más sensato para quienes generan contenido frío en las RRSS. Tener conciencia y amor propio.
to the person reading this comment remember that you are beautiful in your own way and that you are loved by your family and friends, GOD BLESS you and i love you🥺🥰🥰
Canciones como estas que te hacen llorar.
Belleza 😊
The world was a better place before social media, and no one can convince me otherwise. Turn off the phone or computer, and go outside and play with your friends, like we did back in the 1980’s and 90’s.
Inspiras cosas maravillosas Xtina! te amo!
I Will love you for ever, Christina. 🥺❤️
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Essa música é uma das que eu mais gosto! Conheci em 2002, mas me apaixonei por ela em 2003 quando entrei no ensino médio. O início do ensino médio foi delicado pra mim, pois tinha um grupo da minha sala que fazia bullying comigo. Eles diziam que eu era muito feio, me punham apelidos, uma vez até um bilhete com xingamentos me mandaram. Eu chegava em casa ouvia essa música e me sentia curado de todas essas feridas, era catártico, era como um bálsamo pra mim. Hoje sou adulto e as coisas não mudaram muito, até hoje essa música me faz muito bem. Obrigado Christina e Linda Perry. ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
This is so beautiful, no matter what they say.
Esta canción me salvo  Aun recuerdo cómo lloraba al escucharla me desahogue con cada palabra, me libre de todo el odio que recibí 😊 y me hizo aceptarme tal cual soy 😊y empecé a vivir 😊 y cada que sentía que no podía  volvía a esta canción 🎶
I’m 35 years old and I’m still need to listen this song  😔
Wowww this video is so necessary in actuality 🫶🏽
Meu Deeeeuus ❤️
Essa música foi tão importante na minha adolescência 💛
I love it ❤️
This new mv version is for the new generation. Thank you so much Christina! This song, Beautiful saved me from me. I love you Queen!
Inacreditável só comentários em espanhol e português
Bellisimo el video como siempre. Debemos prestar mas atencion a nuestro jovenes que estan perdidos en este mundo superficial... invadidos con mensajes e imagenes de falsa felicidad y bienestar...
Christina, please make more music in English ♥️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 We love you. You are voice of a generation
Love You Young Lady.😊🎤
Uma querida relançando um hit sobre aceitação e amor
I mean its nice, but she used a bunch of beautiful kids to convey a beauty positive message.  Apart from one kid with slightly difficult skin, everyone else is beautiful.  I don't get it.
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Still relevant
Iconic Queen.. I’m hoping she is in this music video. 🥹
Loved this song when I was 11 and loving it now even more!
I so needed this message..the hurt and pain and shame is just too mich these days. We want to be “beautiful “ when we already are!
😍👏
The first time I heard it, I cried and now that  I am listening  again this masterpiece  I am into tears.  Love you so much Xtina. Kisses from Argentina.
Hermoso🌹
QueenTina!
La mejor de todas.... la única que vale la pena en la industria de la música 🥰😍🤩
Essa música e o primeiro clipe me ajudaram tanto a me aceitar. Espero que possa ser tb um sinal de validação para as próximas gerações.
Amé está versión, un mensaje claro... Y el final... Me llevó a mi infancia, la más feliz, sin internet ni redes sociales.... Gracias @xtina por siempre estar ahí y recordarnos que... Somos hermosos, no importa lo que digan... ❤️🇻🇪🏳️‍🌈
You are a legend! Beautiful woman! ❤❤❤
I was hoping for 2022 rendition of this song😢
Love you Xtina ❤
HERMOSO ❤️❤️❤️ . Después de 20 años.  Grande CHRISTINA AGUILERA.
Thank you for this!
En un mundo material y artificial el amor propio es lo esencial ❤
#Queremos Christina Aguilera Aqui No Brasil ✌💚💚💛💛💛💙💙🤩
THIS ! THIS ,THIS AND THIS. This is what we need to be concerned about , not all the other media that is thrown at us .
Obra de arte 💛
Claro que nos inspiras, te amamos todos y todas! ❣️
Essa música...!
You are Beautiful ❤
Essa era uma crítica que realmente se fazia necessária, para vermos o quanto somos bombardeados com o ideal de corpo perfeito. Se nós adultos sofremos, as crianças e adolescentes sofrem o dobro a pressão por ser bonito o tempo todo, neles é muito maior. Hoje em dia todo mundo quer mudar alguma coisa, e isso tem acontecido cada vez mais cedo temos muitos adolescentes de 13, 14 e 15 anos operando nariz, orelhas, lábios, se cortando e se suicidando por conta da ditadura da beleza que é exposta diariamente na internet. Esse trabalho é muito lindo, além de ter um olhar crítico ao mesmo tempo, tem um olhar carinhoso de alerta e preocupação em divulgar a mensagem para alertar as crianças, os adolescentes, e a seus responsáveis sobre o que vem acontecendo.
QUE VIDEO TAN CHAFA E INNECESARIO! NADA QUE VER CON EL CLÁSICO ANTERIOR! ESO SI ES UNA OBRA DE ARTE! EN LUGAR DE HACER ESTO HUBIERAS HECHO UNO PARA GET MINE, GET YOURS/DAME LO QUE YO TE DOY! ESO SI HUBIERA CAUSADO IMPACTO ENTRE GUS FANS QUE TE AMAMOS Y AMAMOS ESA CANCIÓN Y NOS MERECIAMOS UN VIDEO DESDE EL PRINCIPIO!
This was a criticism that was really necessary, to see how bombarded we are with the ideal of the perfect body. If we adults suffer, children and teenagers suffer twice as much, the pressure to be beautiful all the time is much greater. Nowadays everybody wants to change something, and this has been happening earlier and earlier, we have many teenagers of 13, 14 and 15 years old having nose, ears, and lips operated on, cutting themselves and committing suicide because of the dictatorship of beauty that is exposed daily on the internet. This work is very beautiful, besides having a critical look at the same time, it has a caring look of alert and concern in spreading the message to alert children, teenagers, and their guardians about what has been happening.
Muy apta para la época 😞
Wow! 20 years later and this song keeps having such a strong and necessary message!
Es irónico que la Christina Aguilera de 2022 teniendo unos labios nada naturales y siguiendo los estándares de belleza de las kardashian con cuerpos llenos de curvas que se alejan de la realidad, te diga que te aceptes tal como eres. En 2002 se la comprabas, además en ese entonces manejaba una imagen más real y no tan superficial.
1:34 that’s like full on PP
Christina Aguilera Is mi religión 🤣 amoo el videoclip . Todo producción, mensaje final y voz que creo que la misma versión en el audio pero el videoclip versión 2022 es lo más. Es mi inspiración desde que tengo consciencia. 🇦🇷📡👁️‍🗨️🌌💚
😔😔♥️♥️
Acoso, homofobia, bullyng, bulímia… y sigo aquí de pie. Gracias Christina por regalarme una segunda oportunidad, tu música me inspira a seguir brillando, a buscar mi verdad, quien realmente soy y lo que quiero. Te amo❤🥹
Hope this is Grammy 2022's first Best Song For Social Change! 🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼❤️
This record is AMAZING <3
Oh wow 😢❤
Thank you for being our Voice..Love You  Christina!! 🙌💛
Queremos música nueva 😮
Maravilhosa ❤️😍😍😍
Queen ❤️
20 años de este gran Himno! y pareciera ayer las tardes que llegaba de la escuela y ya tenía que pensar que excusas inventarle a mis papás para no ir al día siguiente por sufrir "burlas", "por ser el bicho raro" ,"por ser señalado día a día" , simplemente por ser yo desde siempre, porque en ese entonces la palabra acoso escolar o bullying no se usaban para lo que yo sufría a diario, pero acá estoy. sin darme cuenta está canción me ayudó muchísimo! y volver a escucharla y verla con este nuevo clip, me emociona muchísimo. Se que no soy el único, porque hay millones más a los que esta Gran artista y este himno nos salvó la vida!!! ❤️
Timeless.
This awareness and timely!  Thank you Christina Aguilera 🫂
Love Xtina. Would've been more awesome if she re-recorded this.💙
LEGEND 👑
Christina mi reina hermosa te saludo  tu felipillo de san borja lima peru, te estoy trabajando algo la mitad de bello o bella que tu(pero aun asi esta  bonito) es un solo paragraph y yo quisiera que tu  diseñes el hook mami quiero que vengas y  lo leas creo que te va a encantar
Love youuuu, My queeen!
Un himno que se mantiene vigente en el tiempo❤️
Mds é sobre isso. Eu me arrepiei demais!
Ooohh Christina... You're so necessary.. Thank you
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😭😭😭😭😭😭
E mais uma vez, Beautiful consegue transmitir uma mensagem para os dias atuais sobre o real conceito e entendimento da beleza humana e a essência. Mais um trabalho maravilhoso dessa grande obra de Linda Perry, Xtina e todos os demais envolvidos. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌟🌟🌟🌟
Perfeito, atualíssimo. Tudo a serviço da estética a qualquer custo, seja pra uma falsa ilusão de auto estima. Hoje em dia, no mundo do faço o que quiser, mando no meu corpo, será que mandamos mesmo? continuamos as mesmas práticas e só mudamos o discurso? Faço procedimentos porque quero, porque posso, porque me sinto bem... na incessante busca de ser o que não se é. Xtina Rainha demais.
Me hubiera gustado más que haya cantado una nueva versión…
20 Years ago,  seems like yesterday
This was a really powerful video with such a timeless message. It's crazy to think that this song  is 20 years old. And the message of it needs to be amplified more than ever because of the rise of social media.
OMG Im crying again...this song is a FREEDOM HYMN abosfuck*nlutely ..MAZEL TOV XTINA! You are our defender, you are so empathetic with all this emotions, mental illness, desorders, everything, this must to be a new begining for this new generations and US that we growed with the original versoin since 20 years ago, I ADORE YOU you are so talented and all your team. GOD BLESS YOU GUYS
Lenda. Legend Of music. 🔥😭
Im speechless, this message is powerful and beautiful
En 2022 mi corazón lloro y luego sonrió, porque ahora más que nunca sé que somxs hermosxs en cada pequeño detalle. Nunca permitan que nada ni nadie les haga creer lo contrario.
😍😍😍
Que voz increíble
Han pasado veinte años, pero el mensaje sigue siendo tan poderoso como cuando recién se estrenó la versión original: la sociedad de consumo y la tecnología han ido deteriorando nuestra calidad humana, pero aún seguimos siendo eso, humanos... Quiero pensar que no todo está perdido y que nuestra naturaleza humana será reivindicada por las generaciones venideras, pero para ello, hay muchas cosas que debemos cambiar para mejorar.
Himno ❤
This song is more to see that outer image isn’t everything.
I think I listened this song too very so much please try different things Xtina. 😢
2002 this album changed my life! It’s now 2022, I always turn to this album when going through a rough patch! Thank you for always being there for me, throughout ALL your albums! ❤
Such an amazing message.  Its incredible that has passed 20 years and the intention and the meanig of the sing and the video is still intact.  You are beautiful Xtina. We love U.
Que loco 😮
It’s a beautiful message and song. As always, I’m proud of Christina !! I wish we got to see her in the music video though.
Clip maravilhoso ❤️
la canción es hermosa siempre me ha gustado y es un himno de fortaleza y superación. Mi reacción al vídeo Mmmm ... Me😒.
lloré....
And this is why I’m a forever Christina Aguilera fan, this song speaks deep to my soul  and still does. I find myself listening to this song when I’ve been having bad days and the fact that a woman with a powerful voice like yours and a creative  mind to show visuals of issues like this that f up the young lives today is a true artist, a honest artist.  I absolutely love you for speaking and showing real issues in the world. You definitely saved my life when I was a young girl and I thank you for that❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The struggles of today is far greater than what we had when we were younger. Even at 35 yrs old, I too struggle MORE now than I did back when I was younger. Addiction and other things. If we manage to find a way to ditch EVERYTHING that made us feel like shit & I mean ALL OF US - the world will shine again.
Chorei de novo
Why bother making a new video if you were just going to play it safe? This is somehow LESS inclusive?! So someone who isn't cis, heteronormative, pretty and skinny like all the cast here, is supposed to be inspired by what exactly?
Estoy llorando. 😭 Hermoso.
The end though…I’m never gonna forget that part 🤯
Vinte anos depois e ainda continua atual, hino atemporal
🥺🥺🥺🥺
Ehh, the original video was better.
Porque este vídeo no esta en tendencias
é incrível que uma artista como Christina • usa sua voz/sua imagem pra levar mensagens e reflexões como 'beatiful' e tantas outras. Não ha outra como Christina Aguilera. 🥲💙
This is infinitely more powerful than the first video, but the song and the message are poignant and timeless. Social media is the worst thing that happened in this generation, and not just to our youth. I’m so glad it didn’t exist when I was a kid. So, so glad.
Oh my god💜
I seriously miss the old type of music Christina used to sing :( i get this whole reggaeton/latin thing but her voice can do more than that
Essa música salvou e transformou vidas de milhares de pessoas. Ela é o verdadeiro significado de hino atemporal.
Both videos. The old and new are lit relevant to the song and to the issues we struggling with.   I love you Christina !!!!
This song is still awesome 20 years later with an all too relevant and important video update!
So powerrrfull!!!!!  Gran gran homenaje. Una msj que perdurará en el tiempo y por los siglos de los siglos .
Me gusta 🤩 pero la primera era más  cruda
Que obra-prima! Estou arrepiado
First time round this was a powerful song and video. To be honest I didn't understand the new video until the end and it was quite a punch in the gut to realise what it's about.
Tears 😢 soooo Beautiful 💕
Wow. Powerful. This is why you are called 'the voice of a generation'. ❤️  Timeless song. Timeless message.
Orgulho de ser fã de uma artista tão maravilhosa 😍
Preciosa Christina, marcó a toda una generación con esta canción liberadora y sanadora. Me enorgullece ver como siempre se ha mantenido fiel a sus raíces y a su personalidad.
Estas son las canciones que deberían de tener millones de vistas y no las que hablan de puro sexo como las del 🐰
Rainha
😢😢😢 Thank You
Soy hermoso, no importa lo que digan.
As visualizações estão pouquinhas 🥺
and cried again
2002 💙
Extraordinary. Powerful. Emotional. This shows the power the entertainment industry has in making positive social change. We need a LOT more of this sort of thing. If you all loved this, I highly recommend you go check out the Nightwish video "Noise" (the official video with captioned lyrics, not a live one). It is an amazing video with VERY strong imagery and lyrics like this one that also warns about the many dangers of social media in a very unique way.  If you liked it, come back and let me know, please.
Você me fez chorar em 2002 e me fez chorar novamente em 2022 Eu te amo Christina, você sempre será a frente do seu tempo!!
Powerfull message , My respect. Heard it then, and now, it's THE same problem. Acepting myself everyday
viendo este video no puedo creer que hayan pasado 20 años. Te amo Xtina <3
I can only say this song has even more meaning now!! a timeless song, this video made emotional!!! Beautiful Video Beautiful Song!! Great Job Christina Aguiela and Linda Perry
Gracias por todo. Eres la mejor. 20 años el tiempo no pasa en vano!!!!
Just.. thank you ❤
Healthy video bravo
The one and only Christina Aguilera 🔥❤🔥
Xtina queen da geração
Minha infância é baseada nessa música. Que nostálgica. Obg xtina
I love you Xtina ❤
Muchas gracias Christina!! You're always the best 💜
A b....s.  No le gusta eso jajajajaja
Christina when you released beautiful in 2002 I was only 2 years old and nowadays I am 22 years old and getting emotional, I cried a lot. this new version serves as a spokesperson for many people in this new generation, congratulations Christina for yet another impeccable job. love you very much!!
Si hace 20 años me sentí identificado, hoy también. Es muy difícil como adulto de la comunidad LGBT+ mantenerse dentro de los estándares de belleza hegemónica que ello demanda. Es un largo proceso de aceptarse como es uno en su propio cuerpo, terapia psicológica y medicación para sobrellevar la ansiedad y la depresión. Gracias Xtina por ser un referente en cuanto a estas temáticas! Toda una diva del pop!
No me gustó.......el video de 2002 fue y será icónico pudo ser mejor este video pero no
i love you xtina !!! 💙💙💙
Creo que la nueva generación realmente necesitaba esta canción.
I love you te amo ich liebe dich sooo ❤❤❤❤
4:08
Esse é o.mundo atual
Omg im crying…
20 anos después y me transporta a la época de secundaria, fue duro, pero escuchar esta canción me alegraba, el tiempo ha pasado pero el mensaje sigue vigente, una gran obra musical que nos ayudó a muchos en épocas de muchas tribulaciones. Gracias Xtina
Thank you for sharing this beautiful masterpiece of ART 🖼️ 😢 #LAREINA
Kinda wish she re-recorded the song for the new music video 😭 but I love it either way
❤Eterna Princesa del Pop y Voz de la Generación ❤
Que hermoso video y tan vigente aún 🌹❤gracias por seguir creando conciencia👏👏👏👏👏🙋
Música con profundo contenido es lo que siempre ha hecho Christina Aguilera 🖤
Ya era momento que regresara con lo que realmente demuestra su potencial
Sinceramente entiendo el point pero el primero es insuperable
Hino Obrigado Xtina 🏳️‍🌈❤
Christina has always been the advocate for standing up and pushing boundaries. Forget record sales but I don't think many of her peers have produced an album that has defined a generation and been a voice for the voiceless of an era. Happy anniversary to my all time fav album. Love you always xtina
Im crying 😢
O clipe original de Beautiful já era a frente do seu tempo e 20 anos depois vimos o quanto necessário ele é ... E essa nova versão está impecável... Olhei pra Xtina e gritei: ARTISTA!!!
Hino atemporal. Em 2050, 2100, ainda será  ouvidos. As lágrimas vieram.
OMG 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Love it
Una canción que te hace llorar después de 20 años. Increíble.
Realmente es una canción absolutamente hermosa hace 20 años y hoy sigue produciendo la misma emoción hasta las lagrimas escucharla, leer en comentarios que hace 20 años eran niños y sufrían y hoy 20 años despues dicen que gracias a esta canción superaron sus miedos, escaparon de sus realidades es más hermoso de leer, gracias Christina por recordarnos que somos hermosos sin importan lo que diga la gente.
when I was just a kid, I didn't quite understand the weight of music, which it truly has. but, today, I truly feel, thank you for everything, since always, since I was a child, xtina!!
Es una canción atemporal muy llegadora.
I’m just crying so hard watching this. This message and video need to reach the new generation.
💋❤️🔥⚡⚡⚡
Admito que esta canción me hace recordar una etapa muy fuerte en mi vida... La cual pude canalizar y ser FELIZ.. Esta canción es un himno para todas las personas que no se sienten seguros de si mismo. <3 Es hora de aceptarnos tal y como somos. :D
MUY FUERTE!!
What a powerful song. I remember when this first came out, it rings strikingly clear, especially now. Thank you.
❤ love it!! 😥
As a new parent, this hit me so hard. It's our responsibilty to protect our kids from all the images and noise from social media. It's gonna be a tough job, but knowing that there are voices and community like this... we can win this!
Como eu me emocionei 😭
Amo 🖤 Lloro hoy, como lloré hace 20 años cuando tenía 7 🖤🩹 Su talento trasciende todo lo que la industria pueda ofrecer, el verdadero artista sabe tocar las almas 🖤 Para mí es como un himno que resuena en mi corazón 🖤🩹
La canción del 2002, que bonitos recuerdos!!! ❤️. Ahora con un videoclip sobre las consecuencias del uso de las redes sociales a través de la tecnología. Todos merecemos ser respetados. Gracias Christina Aguilera por el hermoso mensaje. 🇵🇪❤️
En LATAM te amamos XTINA!👑🔥❤️✅
powerful and needed now more than ever.  This generation is destroying their natural beauty.  The Kardashians with their extreme procedures have been a horrible role model for the youth of today.  I miss seeing real faces.
Christina has been saving my life since 2000 by handling such sensitive issues in such an organic and artistic way.  For every moment in my life where I have been or continue to be subjugated or bullied there is an Aguilera song to rescue me.  I love being touched by her work and her art! Thanks for continuing to save my life! ❤❤❤

Ésta canción me ha acompañado por 20 años, reconfortando mi ser en momentos difíciles y llenos de incertidumbre. Un himno que me llena de esperanza y me da ánimo para continuar 😇 Gracias por resplandecer y compartir tu voz alentando a los demás a no rendirse y continuar hacia la LUZ 🪄✨🌟. El universo te envío y me honra con tu existencia, bendiciones 🙏🏻.
AWESOME AND AMAZING VIDEO 💕💕💕💕
Que mensagem! ❤
O wow.
A very necesary reminder in these superficial times
Gracias Lynda Perri por está joya invaluable de canción
Thank's, amazing video
Wow this video made me cry ! Love this message 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
❤😍
Tan cierto es! Gracias Christina Aguilera por regalarnos una versión actual de esta canción que tanto marco!. Te admiro y te sigo desde niña. Ojalá que este mensaje llegue a todos los padres para que dejen vivir cada etapa de sus hijos como corresponde y seamos una mejor sociedad ☺️
Ahora la realidad así es... nos preocupamos más en como nos vemos, en como se ven los demás ...todo gira alrededor de la apariencia y emos dejado de amar lo que somos, nuestra esencia, nuestro verdaderos sentimientos lo ahogamos para vivir bajo una vida llena de apariencias y materialismo...
Lejos el mjr himno ❤️ para apreciar la vida y tu hermosa escencia k es unica aun muchas veces no la vemos grasias ❤️ Xtina por recordarme lo hermoso q soy ❣️
😭😭😭😭 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️
I love this song thanks Cristina ❤️
but xtina herself was exposing a sexy image on young persons back then with her dirrty video lol
Masterpiece 😢
Powerful Words, Powerful Imagery, Powerful Message. Thank you for re-releasing a relevant video for today's "Tik Tok" Youth :)
Yes, we are all beautiful ❤️❤️
This song will never get old. Such a important message. Thank you Christina ❤️
A xtina sempre arrasa trazendo pensamentos libertadores pra uma geração que tenta seguir um modelo padrão de beleza e esquece que o padrão tem que ser como seres que se amam ,se respeitam e faz o melhor para o seu próximo.
Best song ever Queen XTina. It got me in 2012 and now again ❤️ Love you always!
Ughhh beautiful
Love that most of the actors are children - really drives the message home 😢
You did it again. 🙌🏻👏
Thank you Christina on behalf of my generation and the next after next and after...
This is great.. But I was hoping Christina would be in it..
THANKS FOR THIS VERSION!!! 🌈👏🏼
My ultimate most favorite song in the planet earth for all the time
I love this version!!! 2022! To new generations!
This song will always hit
The purpose of this song is still and will always be relevant to all of us. The legacy continues. Such a wonderful video version, wonderful vocals and superb lyrics and music ❤️❤️❤️
Tu legado en en este mundo siempre será extraordinario. Eres increíble no solo por el talento que existe en tu voz sino en tu capacidad de trasmitir cada sentimiento, gracias!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
A minha infância nunca foi fácil,e essa música me trouxe de voltar a vida.
El mundo necesita escuchar esto.
I thought I was going to listen to a second version of beautiful, the continuation rather, but I'm listening to the same song but with a different video. Yo quería escuchar una canción nueva, una nueva versión de Beautiful, por lo menos yo me espere algo hací, pero esta bien, el vídeo aunque tenga la misma canción deja un gran mensaje para todos nosotros.
#LAAMO 🌹🌹🌹❤❤❤
There is so much that i wanna say about this but all i can say is u did it again! Wowww 🙌🏽🙌🏽 Legend!!! Sending my love from Indonesia.. xoxo and i hope everyone all the best and goodluck for everything that we are going through.. God Bless
👏👏👏🙏❤️🙏
te amo cristina siempre seras la mejor cantante del mundo
Oh my... That made me cry
20 years later and still no disabled people. At least this video feels more relevant to the song than the original.
What a beautiful and powerful message! You make me cry again! This is a reallity the world don't want to see...
Después de 20 años, se mantiene vigente, una canción atemporal y hoy cobra mayor sentido!
Después de 20 años y me sigo sintiendo identificado con esta canción 💔 Amo el nuevo video, te amo Xtina ♥️
Icon . Epic. Beautiful. Love #Xtina #christinaaguilera
It would have been more beautiful if she re-recorded it with new vocals 🥺
Ditch the smartphones live your life
Good job xtina, LOVE u ❤️
This is the reason why I love this Christina Aguilera song so much. It means a lot. Thank you, Christina.
Amo
Preciosa canción, pasen los años que pasen!! 🥰🥰
So thanks for making me a fighter
I've no words to express how I feel about this video, it is so so so beautiful, thank you Christina for keeping making art🥺❤️
Un buen mensaje de verdad 👏👏👏👏
What an amazing and powerful video!
Solo faltó salir Christina en el vídeo Pero fue realmente emocionante como la primera versión ❤️ Gracias por visibilizar los sentimientos de muchos Te amo Xtina 👑
Are the vocals rerecorded or the same as 2002? Or vocals the same, Just a new MV?
It makes me cry...
AMAZING 😭
This new video is wonderful. At the end, it points out you should seek help for body image and other mental health issues at their website. Their website has *zero*, nada, nothing, just ways to buy her album.
I love you so much X, thanks for always bringing us up, xxx
Christina sin darse cuenta hace 20 años creo un himno de amor y autoaceptacion tan grande del nivel de "Express Yourself" y "Born This Way", esta canción junto con "Fighter" le han dado un espacio en el legado mundial de la música.
This video is so relevant to todays world this made me sob and cry well done christina on doing such a fine job
💕💕💕💕🥲💕💕💕💕
Powerful message!
Aún recuerdo mis 21 años lleno de miedo, castigandome por no aceptarme tal como soy, llega esta canción y todo el album de Stripped y me libero, soy libre y feliz, procesos dificiles en el camino siempre encontraré, gracias mi reyna Aguilera por este himno magistral.
Beautiful
What a beautiful message (again) especially for this new generation!!!! Amazing work ❤️❤️❤️❤️
🥺❤️ thank you for this queen. this new generation needed this as badly as it was needed then
Beautifull
❤️THE MASTERPIECE OF POP! 🔥LEGENDTINA!👑 THE VOICE OF GENERATION 👑
This is powerful!
Gracias Xtina por darme esperanzas hoy!
It would have been cool that she record a new version with the MV
😍😍😍😍😍
♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥
La.mejor canción del álbum Stripped❤️
I had goosebumps since the first second… 🖤🖤
WOWWWWWW <3
Espero que a Christina lance as outras muisicas do Ep la luz
🥰🤧
I would have recorded a new version too thought. I mean a new Video is okay, but hearing the same song with a different video is like not matching.  I would have preferred to listen to a new version of Beautiful.
Essa música significa muito para todos nós fans que sobrevivemos aos desafios da vida, Christina é tão importante quanto a canção 💙
Goosebumps. I’d love to see another fighter video
MUSIC VIDEO OF THE YEAR!!!!
So so so inspiring.. and true ❤
Happy 20th anniversary to this masterpiece, 'Beautiful' inspired so many youngster back then when it was first release including me, It signify that our world always showing us our flaws but the truth is we need to embrace it, No one can ever tell us what is perfect but ourselves. Especially social media is very rampant many teenagers triggers their insecurities then later on it will affect their mental health, Spread love and kindness. 💕
Incredible ❤️
I’m so glad I grew up in the 80s with no social media. Playing in fields and trees and rivers and parks. Kids have it so hard these days with social media.
I love you Christina, you are a trully inspiration since the first time I heard you. You have a voice of an angel that light up our lives. Happy to born in the same world that yours, God bless u!!
Beautiful music ⭐👏
Very good 👏👏👏👏
Such an hymn.
Te amo mi diosa ❤️ la mejor voz del mundo, mereces más visitas 😭
El himno de toda una generación... Gracias Xtina
You Saved so many LIFE'S
It’s always been empowering!❤
Saving many lives! Lika mine!
Te amo Tina ❤❤❤❤
QUEEN OF POP
Dyva
hmmm…
Smutne ale Prawdziwe
It would have been cool to have a new recording
We never deserved Christina Aguilera
Muy lindo el video y todo pero realmente SON PUROS NIÑOS Y ADOLECENTES QUE ESTAN DENTRO DE LO QUE SE DENOMINA BELLEZA PRO LA SOCIEDAD facciones perfectas y cuerpos super delgados en su mayoría... bello tema no se debió manosear con este video tan contradictorio
Why Xtina is not in the video? …
que maravilla CRISTINA  AGUILERA,además bellísima cantante
Goosebumps!
Beautiful, just as much as before ❤️
💔💓🐈
Such a powerful message!
20 anos depois me pego chorando com a mesma música e um novo videoclipe! Christina Aguilera segue sendo uma das maiores vozes contra a opressão e preconceito na música pop! Thank you Xtina 😍😍😍😍
Wow. This is still so relevant, even more so it seems. Wow.
Social media made it worse. The message of this song still stands, and we didn't even know the full extent of it back when it came out.
NECESSÁRIO! Apenas.
Te amo mucho Christina me hiciste llorar un sentimiento doloroso no amarse asi mismo me duele, gracias por aceptamos cómo somos
❤
#ChristinaAguilera ❤️🇧🇷
Beautiful video but i was hoping for a new version with her current voice.
Me gustaba la versión original y me gusta esta también. Ambas fueron aptas en sus tiempos, los temas tocados en esta versión son la realidad ahora, la aceptación en redes sociales, vidas falsas de creadores de contenidos, la sexualización de los niños haciéndoles vestir y reaccionar como adultos, la angustia de querer cambiar algo de su cuerpo para "sentirse bellos" porque así está de moda. En fin, gracias Cristina por darles a las personas una canción que te dice : eres bello o bella tal cual eres y no necesitas la aceptación de nadie, ámate tal cual eres.
Maravilhosa! Que vídeo lindo e necessário, atemporal!
It's totally now, but I miss xtina herself in this vid
❤❤❤❤❤
Em 2002 essa música me marcou tanto...  em 2022 ela me marcou mais ainda... ❣ que hinoooo meus amigos, que hino!
Beautiful video and great message behind it ! Congratulations 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 ❤️❤️❤️
❤️
Hi siri, updated trauma: black mirror musical.
Argentina TE AMA.. temazo parece que volvimos al año 2002
O vídeo mais bonito de Christina! Parece ter vindo do coração💜❤ Obrigado🙏💕 Essa música continua me inspirando!!!
🙏🙏❤️❤️
Isso é realmente muito lindo
La voz de esta mujer es de otro mundo
Xtina, thank you so much for being extremely necessary to this generation as the way you are important to mine. This anthem didn't change the real meaning about we need to talk and in times likes this, we need to carry a lot about our teens and kids mental health as we mind with ours. I truly love you! <3
Beautiful masterpiece in 2022 thank you Christina, for being EVER YOU❤😭
Beautiful
Duele como la primera vez…vaya sin palabras
Wow! The message is still so powerfull after 20 years
My girl has done it again… you just keep reminding me of how much i love you & why. Thank you!! 😢❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Oh my ... This voice sounds like it's from a different universe!
Que los niños vuelvan a ser niños 🖤
Gostei do clip , mas esperava mais
love u
In tears. Thank you, Christina. ❤️🇧🇷
Perfeita 💚💛
❤️❤️❤️
Amazing ❤ . This song means a lot for me
Ah 20 years later and nothing has changed, it's even worse. But we have to keep fighting!
Meu deus que obra prima😍🤩🤩😢
All my teenage years in a song!!! This song always makes me dream of a better world!
Perfeito
En mi caso no daré gracias por una sola canción, daré gracias por Stripped completo. Fue y es un disco que me ayudo a sobre llevar una adolescencia pesada, entre la crueldad estudiantil, una familia disfuncional y confusión sexual. Christina Aguilera y su voz me ayudaron a tomar fuerza de donde no la tenia y me dieron luz.  Christina Aguilera ❤
The world 🌎 needs more people like u Love u
Omg the message in this new version is touching. I'm literally in tears. I hope that this video reaches the new generations in order to they can be more awarness about mental health and self love.
I think this song makes more sense now. Christina is a visionary. I love this song. Beautiful forever. ❤
Wow. Powerful video.
Time flies
20 years from the Stripped album wow !
Kids and parents should wake up!!! You are so right, Christina!!!
Te amoooo Xtina 💙💖💙💖💙💖💙💖💙💖💙💖
😭😭😭
ITS SO BEAUTIFUL 😍😍😍😍😍
If Christina hadn’t done every aesthetic surgery that exists , the video would have been more beautiful/impactful
I've seen my little sister struggle with having body dysmorphia and CA is right man! I feel so bad for all and anyone who has been effective! Keep strong everyone. Such a beautiful meaning song even after all these years after it's release.
Tenía 10 años cuando en 2002 cuando apareciste en mi vida. Beautifull me hizo quererme cuando nadie más lo hizo y Fighter me dio la fuerza para enfrentarme a todo el bullying escolar por ser la persona que soy. Hoy, 20 años más tarde me has hecho llorar con este hermoso vídeo y la cruda verdad que refleja ❤ Gracias por existir e iluminar mi vida con tu música. Te amo Cris 🥹
By 2022, you mean just take out white people
Not me here bawling my eyes out...
Christina Aguilera ❤
reflete bastante a realidade. Atualizou
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yes ❤
I like her vocals
Adore this song and new video ❤
❤️
This song has inspired me so much. Thank u Christina xxx
Timeless & classic song 🎵
This is such a powerful message ❤
💪
Please finally Europe tour and new English album
❤ 💯
This song saved my life.
My favorite xtina song, since I heard it when I was 9 years old!  (♡) We are Beautiful!!
Essencial!
Foda ❤️
Que clipe forte 😢
Que gran vídeo y que gran artista...
Did I cry? Of course I did! Is this one of the main reasons for which I don't wanna have kids? You can bet it is! I grew up in the era where fun meant playing hide and seek and went to highschool before facebook was even invented. I was there when they invented youtube. But no amount of information and knowledge could prepare me for what this generation of young children is facing. It's terrifying me and I don't know how I would raise a child in this society. So yeah, this made me cry and broke my heart over and over again! If you're a parent and you're reading this comment, good luck to you! You are a insanely brave soul! My prayers are with you and your babies! 💔
My Queen, kisses from Brazil, we love you!
This video is released by a woman who has used Botox, 100 face fillers, changed the way her lips look, redone her nose, breast enlargement, and a fake ass. This is why she will always be a flop and this is why people had always adored Britney over her
Y aún el mundo sigue igual dejando que lo más importante sea el cómo  te mires y ahora también en cuánto dinero tengas  si eres alguien  popular  :(
❤️
wowowowow, el mundo te dice gracias por exponer este llamado de atención en forma de arte.
Sin importar el que #Alwaysbeautiful #Xtina ♥
One of your best song
I love yoi
❤️
😍😍❤️❤️❤️
Even though this song is 20yo she made me cry once again like she did in 2002 😭❤️ Love you forever!❤️ Once a fighter always a fighter! Thank you 4 that!
The end with the phone bleeding was DOPE.   LUV U, QUEENTINA
Un gran mensaje!!! 💛💛💛💛
This music video is an ad. Telling people how perjudicial is social media. Thanks for say this ✌🙏
Just as hard hitting today as this song was when it was first put out in 2002.  20 years on and STILL just as imported as it is today. Thank you so much for putting out again.
La salud mental es lo mas importante..y aunque han pasado 20 años y la tecnologia nos ha hecho esclavos..llegan producciones como estas para despejar nuestra mente.
Cool
Xtina vc é maravilhosa!
Um marco em 2002, e continua sendo tão importante quanto, uma mensagem, algo que ultrapassa o tempo, e continua sendo atual, obrigado por dar luz a essa música, obrigado por nós dar forças em todos os momentos com essa e muitas outras músicas suas, viva a  beautiful, obrigado por tudo, Queen Xtina ❤️❤️❤️
Te amo xtina ❤ gracias por cambiar mi vida y acompañarme en esos momentos donde solo me tenia a mi, mis pensamientos y tu voz recordándome lo valioso que soy 🫶🏻✨
🗣️💞 AMOUR 💞☮️5️⃣☮️
'Beautiful', saving lives since 2002 🙏.
Amazing. A lot has changed but yet so much has gotten worse.
Caralho.... Christina é foda mano
🗣️💞🎆🎆🎆🎆🎆💞🌐💞
Excelente video. Muy fuerte el dispensador de medicamentos...
💋
Una obra maestra y con un mensaje tan poderoso que trasciende las épocas, solo nos queda pensar el uso tan nocivo que tienen hoy día herramientas que fueron pensadas para mejorar nuestra comunicación y las consecuencias tan nefastas que hoy acarrean...gracias @xtina por actualizar tu mensaje tan válido hoy como hace 20 años #WeAreBeautifulNoMatterWhatTheySay
Now why would you do this to me. IM CRYING MY EYES OUT
Mucho más que música ❤
🗣️💞5️⃣🇺🇸🇪🇺🇫🇷5️⃣💞🌐💞😘💞💃🌷🐴💞🎆💞🛀🌷
This will forever be one of the best songs ever released
No estoy SOPORTANDO!!! 😰😢✨ Divina 🌬💕
Such an important message! Thank you Christina ❤️
💙
I’m sorry but the original video can’t be topped!  This song is so powerful, helped not only me but millions of other people and I’m so thankful for that! I even tattooed it on me to always remember that I’m beautiful, we are beautiful! Thank you Xtina and Linda Perry! 💜
Esse video clipe quando foi lançado a sua primeira vez ajudou muito a ver como estavamos e como as transformações em mim tavam ocorrendo, agora vejo exatamente o mesmo com a nova versão.
That’s why I deleted all my social media… I’m beautiful, and I don’t have to compare myself with anyone else, or feel belittled by not looking like them.
Anthem
Rainha!
🤍🤍🤍
I was a little kid when this song was released... U, ur message, ur voice, saved me from my hell... The bullying destroyed my mental health, and this song... this song was like a cuddle to my soul... Thanks so much... cuz 20 years later, I'm here, singing songs in spanish, to inspire people to be themselvs... I love u Xtina... forever and always...
Queen!!
Orra! 😮. E nois Christina Maria Aguilera. A nossa representante  da América latina!! 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
😮👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
No estoy llorando, solo se me ha metido una basurita en el ojo😭
Another great video for this amazing song! Nothing mediocre comes from you. Thank you Christina Aguilera!
Where are transgender people?
Speechless. This song to this day moves me as much as the first day. Vocals, message, video, all so beautiful. Thank you, Christina, I love you. <3
The first version also broke my heart not to see it now as a transgender person who had transgender people and I was so disappointed that I was a fighter and had been waiting for this clip for days.
Tão bom reviver esse hino,e é muito legal pq eu fui conhecer a música em 2022 justamente o ano em que completa 20 anos
Sinceramente GRACIAS por relanzar esta pieza, ojalá este video haga recapacitar a quienes supervisan a los niños que están tan expuestos en esta era.
Wow ! Lo máximo Xtina !
POWERFUL.
Transgender? No christina I am sorry
Beautiful 🎶🦋🎧💎
❤️
Best song ever❤️
❤
Debería haber grabado una nueva versión de la canción, no solo un nuevo video pero bueno sigue siendo un himno
👏🏾😍🇧🇷
I just wish this was a re-recorded vocal 🥺 she sings it so much differently now and i love the new arrangement 🥺
ICONIC
i was bullied
20 años después, la canción sigue emocionando y este vídeo tan adecuado a la realidad simplemente es maravilloso. Gracias Christina por siempre dar mensajes que movilizan.
Love you Xtina ❤ beautiful MV and an even more extraordinary message behind it 👏🔥
PERFECTA
Aquí sigo, amando a esta mujer, a muchos nos has recaldado que We are BEAUTIFUL.
O clipe de Beautiful e a mensagem da canção foram importantes para minha sobrevivência a medida que, todos os dias, a criança de 13 anos que fui assistia ao clipe para compreender que a minha existência era possível. Tanto anos depois, torço para que Beautiful tenha o mesmo impacto em outras vidas.
Esta a millones de años luz de superar al video original...Muy malo la verdad...Malisimo
Atemporal
I loved it .
Thank you ❤
How sad that 20 years passed and direct message of this song is still up-to-date. Thanks you for this video, very on point.
Wow, Christina como siempre dando un mensaje en sus videos. La canción y video de hace 20 años abrió una puerta a muchos que sufrían en silencio. Y ahora este nuevo video demuestra que la tecnología y todo lo que conlleva (redes sociales y demás) abre una puerta inmensa que puede hacer daño a los más pequeños, sintiéndose inseguros desde la adolescencia cuando lo que deberían es dísfrutar de su niñez y juventud tál como lo muestra al final el video. Gracias Christina por hacer música que cambia vidas, sigue demostrando tú talento. Más música por favorrr. 👏👏👏
Nah you don’t feel the same emotion, the song was written by Linda Perry she really felt the lyrics of the song and then the original video was darker and more rock than this I just stay with the original I didn’t feel anything with this one is so forced and fake
Un mensaje que es importante tener en cuenta en estos tiempos en el que la forja de la autoestima depende de la opinión de los demás en vez de el criterio de la propia persona... we are beautiful people
Pensé que iba a cantarla con su voz de actual.
🌧️🌧️🌧️🌧️
spanish infected commentary? WHY?
Thank you Christina and all the people that made this very impactful version of Beautiful. The 2002 video was groundbreaking at the time for its message and the 2022 video is earth shattering for how it resonates with the reality of the world we live in now. Kids want to grow up too fast and become famous influencers. It’s terrible and it’s sad that we could allow this without thinking of their mental health. We were the millennials that grew up with these songs and demanded positive change and progress in the world. But now, sadly, we are causing more harm than we know by allowing kids to be exposed to too much social media. We need to be more responsible.
This song still been powerfull and resonates hard and louder all of us are beautiful in our Best way
Cuando tenia 12 años.... bla bla bla.... completa con una historia falsa para hacerte la victima. saludos
Sin palabras, solo orgullo de ser Figther ❤
So necessary, thanks Xtina ❤
Amo esta canción
You touched my soul back in 2002, and you still touch my soul nowadays in 2022. Proud of you ❤️
Esta canción es salvadora
A great message, I am 26 and I just remember how brutal my childhood was, being told by your family that you ugly it stays with you forever. even to this day it still haunts me. Tell your kids that they are perfect, love them and make sure they feel confidence all the time, ITS A MUST! Cos if you dont protect them they will be broken forever
Un gran tema
🖤🖤🖤😍
Me hizo llorar 😭🇦🇷💎🍒💕
Es increíble todo lo que haces.... Eres arte y naciste para mostrarle al mundo maravillosa que eres.
That is why I call my lady Xtina as the Artist With A Purpose. She always inspires and makes music that's real and true and serves a real purpose. Thank you Xtina. I feel like I can't love you enough but just know that I love you. Please never stop ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
Chills and tears. Greater appreciation for this song
Se me puso la piel chinita, te amo Xtina🖤 gracias por esto
Thank you!
Canción más actual que nunca. Dejen a los niños ser como quieran ser, se les inculca valores, no estándares.
Wow I was like a pre teen when stripped came out! What a queen. Always stayed true to her words and messages.
Song that changed so many lifes.
Idk. I just feel like we are more moving toward body positivity and this is just going backwards. Idk . Maybe it's cause the original really meant something to me and I'm not this generation
*Beautiful* - Christina Aguilera _(Christina’s Version)_
BEAUTIFUL, no words ..chills, thank you XTINA you are my idol
love u queen!!  thanks 🤍❤
Wow super 😍esto es arte en estos tiempos donde la música ya casi no tiene sentido.
Que canción y videoclip tan poderosos. No puede tener un nombre más apropiado. Que bueno que se le de importancia a la salud mental.
Christina Aguilera me ha hecho llorar dos veces en la misma semana! Primero con No es que te extrañe y ahora con Beautiful. Qué pasa? 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 #saludmental
Ameeeeeeiiii 💖🎉💘💘💋
Chilling, well done whoever made this
Muchas gracias mi Reina hermosa. por atreverte a plasmar imágenes tan  crudas y reales en tus videos. Te Amo. Gracias por tanto amor
Perfeita
Ver este video me llena tanto de nostalgia el saber que todos hemos pasado por una situación parecida, Christina eres leyenda
Eso es arte
Definitivamente una de las mejores canciones de Xtina, dejando en claro un mensaje que trasciende hasta la actualidad #Beautiful  la Amo
Hermoso
ESPECTACULAR se me hizo la piel chinita y un nudo en la garganta.
What a beautiful message
Amazing just amazing, this song is so beautiful and heartbreaking, i feel so proud of this song. This is empowering, thank you Christina ❤️❤️
So proud being a fighter! Love you Christina ❤️
Ficou lindo demais mdsss 😭🤍
Iconic song
Work of art
😍😍😍😍
Wow. This was so beautifully made. This does need to change, and the fact that Christina is using her platform for this is truly admirable.
So long time ago 🤧
your one of a kind .. ur voice never gets old.. it gets better  and better every single year .. all of ur songs are dope and deep .. we love u Xtina  .. cheers to u💖
Gracias Cristina ❤
Imposible no llorar con esta canción y más con el mensaje que transmite este vídeo.
Don't you ever bring me down... Hmmm no today...
Woke version
i love you xtina
This is amazing, xtina you made me cry ❤️
♥
20 years later and this song still has such an impactful message. Great to see it become relevant for the future generation. Beautiful!
Este video va mas acorde con la cancion. El video anterior era adultos lidiando con cosas de adultos, pero este contuntende video muestra a niños que debido a la masiva exposicion a las redes sociales tiene que lidiar con cosas de adultos. Muchos creen que el problema es el bullying y no es asi, el problema son las redes y su falcedad. Padres a cuidar mejor a nuestros hijos.
Te amooooo
Christina's. Music is a life changing ♥
Wait, the video is criticizing what she does in real life: she has surgeries all over her body yet she encourages people through this video not to do it because they're beautiful, where's the coherence here? I mean one's free to do whatever one wants with one's body but this video is clearly senseless and hypocritical to me. Wait, not the video but the artist. I like the original video more. I think it is more transparent.
20 años inolvidable de la música 😂😂🇵🇾🇵🇾 Paraguay XTINA
Cómo está hay pocas canciones que logran conmover, en sociedad superficial como la de 20 años y en la actual, es necesario saber que tienes un valor como ser humano y no serás más feliz por fingir algo que no eres, gracias Christina por esta canción y por estos hermosos videos. ❤️
Lo más loco es que Cristina se opero todo y ahora saca este video, nada tiene sentido.
Cómo los medios audiovisuales han influido y siguen influyendo en la juventud
ganda
Qué hermoso video nos acaba de regalar Christina y su equipo de trabajo. gran manera del update al video a esta bella canción.
The Queen making us look into ourselves once again. Thank you for caring ❤ this is beautiful!
I love you so much 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
pese que la volveria a grabar pero solo realizo un video clip nuevo.
You outdid yourself on this track.
Hermosaaaa canción,  con la mejor 😍🙏
Masterpiece!!! So important message!! I was a teenager in 2002 and now I have to raise my girls to beautiful girls!!! Thank you christina! Thank you so much!! I love you and my daughters (8 & 6y) too!!! ❤️
Simplemente, me encantó
♥
Este fue el primer disco original que compré con mi dinero. Tenía 15 años en el 2002. En Venezuela.  Me acuerdo que la primera canción que escuché fue Dirrty. Y repetía The voice within una y otra vez.  Cuando salió el video de Beautiful fue liberador ver a dos hombres besándose. Esto me dio confianza y aceptación como gay. Y me hizo ver en otra perspectiva los problemas de muchos otros, incluyendo a mi hermana, quien era anoréxica y bulímica.   Me acuerdo que traduje la canción con un diccionario de inglés y la escribí en un papel.  Cuando fui a mi primer concierto de Christina aguilera hace 3 años, era mi yo de 15 años bailando, cantando y escuchando a todo volumen este disco en mi vieja casa cuando no había nadie.
I FUC@@@ING ADORE YOUUUU FOR THISSS!!!
Christina is literally giving us everything, and has been for the past few years. 😍😍 She meant what she said when she said: "I promise I will keep the momentum going." ❤❤❤🧡🧡💜💜💙💙💚💚💛💛🤎🤎
TE AMO CHRISTINA! 20 años escuchándote y apoyándote no han pasado en vano. The voice of our generation.
I find this a little bit sad because this is not the image that Christina is actually showing to all the girls looking at her social media right now. American artists rarely don't go over esthetic changes to get more attention and I think it's hard even for those who do to keep up with all  the expectations that they and the whole industry have set about beauty standards... Like I said, it makes me feel sad.
Que loco que haga una nueva versión de videoclip de esta cancion, luego de ella haberse operado toda la cara……. Estaria dando un me saje contradictorio
Prefiero el video original, en este no sale ella 😑
Hace 20 años compré este disco, y su letra me ayudó mucho, desde entonces a través de los años cada que me siento en mis darkest times (como ahora desde hace unos meses) lo escucho, y las salidas fáciles los pensamientos negativos poco a poco salen de mi mente, hace #20YearsOfStripped tocó mi vida de una manera increíble fue desde ese álbum que xtina se convirtió en mi cantante favorita, a veces cuando no tienes a nadie simplemente la música ayuda mucho, esta nueva versión del video esta padrísimo! 😊  gracias xtina por salvar mi vida, ojalá vengas a Mexico y tenga la oportunidad de conocerte
🤗
This is a beautiful song this go out to all the men and women out there everywhere 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
oh please, what a hypocrite you are Christina. You get lip fillers every now and then, you have had BBLs and breast augmentations etc and you know what? there is nothing wrong with that. As a trans person, plastic surgery has saved my life. So, STFU with your hypocricy
Mi querida X-tina, esta canción me hizo aceptarme a mi misma hace 20 años atrás, la verdad ahora se convertira en un himno para esta generación y para mis hijas. GRACIAS por eso, volví a llorar... GENIA
Wow 20 years later everything changes got me in tears. 😢 We are beautiful the way we are just remember that be yourself and love yourself who you are.❤
Está canción es simplemente un himno, recuerdo cuándo salió me pego tan fuerte el mensaje, era mi refugio cada vez que llegaba llorando del secundario, lloré tanto por todo el maltrato, por el bullying de no ser delgada y perfecta como se suponia que debiamos ser las jóvenes adolescentes; extremadamente delgadas, de ojos claros, altas, rubias, sufrir bullying por como te ves o como eres, es una cicatriz que no sé quita más del alma, sufro aún ya con 34 años serios trastornos alimenticios ligados a la depresión y trastorno de la personalidad por ser víctima de bullying durante todo mi estadio en la secundaria, sin que nadie me escuchará en aquel entonces, es así que está canción se convirtió en mi refugio único.
So necessary 💔🤎🤎
Where are my trans brothers and sisters?
Esta canción es mi favorita desde hace muchos años, y ahora me he vuelto a enamorar de ella. Un vídeo más actual la ha sacado desde el desván para revivirla. Gracias Christina Aguilera 👄 la mejor voz del mundo 🙏🏻
La canción salió cuando estaba en la secundaria y pues veíamos MTV y recuerdo los comentarios de mis compañeros, especialmente mujeres que decían "qué asco cuando se besan los dos hombres". Lo poco o nulo entendimiento que tenían del video.
Amoooo! Beutifulllll🦋
Maravillosa 🌹🎶💙
This song means so much thank you christina aguilera ❤❤
Muy acorde a la época pero sigo siendo Fan de la primera versión, mas oscura y diciente.
I love this new video version.. Current and relatable. A must see for all teens and children.
Essa música nunca fica ultrapassada!
La misma canción montaron en un nuevo video
Una nueva versión cada 20 años ❤
❤ soooo good
Himno al amor  propio  no importa lo que los demás digan .....
Oh I love that she remake this one
I love you Christina! ❤
The meaning of these song is so beautiful like the title itself.. This is one of my fave Christina's song... And the mv song made me cringe also social media sites gave us more anxiety, low self esteem, self pity and etc. So I love the meaning of these song always love ourselves no matter what because we are beautiful in our own ways. Beautiful no matter what they said. 👏
Que la felicidad la libertad 🗽 y la salud siempre os acompañe, que paséis un muy buen y feliz otoño disfrutadlo saludos 🗽🗽⛩️🗽🗽💘
Can't believe it's been 20 years. Thank you Christina.
Gracias por este vídeo, tan bonito 😍 ❤ me pusiste la piel de gallina . 🌈
Como sempre Aguilera nos arranca suspiros e viagem ao tempo, e deixa aquele "nó" na garganta com tanta verdade nessa nova interpretação.  UAU... 😢 #DIVA #BRAZIL # BRASIL
Sem palavras..Christina aguilera a maior sempre. Obrigado queen <3
Está canción ahora más que nunca tiene sentido gracias xtina por revivirla
Nostalgia infinita ❤
Hermosa canción con un gran vídeo.
Ah! Não... Vc me fez chorar, Christina Aguilera. Realmente,estamos vivendo dias em que as crianças estão sendo exigidas, não é sobre o corpo em si só,mas em tudo. Tratam as crianças como adultos,como se soubessem o que fazer... E aí entra meu questionamento: será que não estamos formando adultos do futuro que serão frustrados,doentes psicologicamente? Este vídeo traz esta reflexão... Crianças precisam brincar e estudar,nada além disso. Se é gordo,magro,sardento,ruivo, negro,não importa... importa elas crescerem de forma sadia,sem cobranças por corpo bonito,mas sim,que estejam saudáveis.
😭❤️💔
Es tan hermoso leer infinidad de experiencias y los sentimientos de superación que a cada uno nos ha dado esta canción y que ojalá  las nuevas generaciones lo lleven en el alma cómo muchos de nosotros   Gracias X-TINA por tanto amor para tus fans al rededor del mundo ♥️♥️♥️
You know what you have the most amazing beautiful voice I think I’ve ever heard however your violence towards children completely destroys it! #christiansmatter #alllivesmatterAnd should procreate
Really nice recent about this time you didn’t reflect the gay community😢
wow
very timely and relevant, to my country, which is the philippines
me gustó más que el antiguo 😃😃😃😃 muy inspirador !!!!
I'm crying, again, powerfull strong and unique message at the end!
❤️🇧🇷
A lenda ❣️❣️
Un verdadero HIMNO DE AGUILERA ❤️❤️❤️🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄🦄❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The impact of this song has passed the test of time. This video needs to be watched and talked about. We need to stop ourselves as citizens of the world and look within.. How is our obsession with perfection affecting all of us maily in a world where what we say how we dress, and what we look like is never enough. I wish there were more videos like this with actual message  Instead of trying to meet a standard let's live unapologetically embracing the beauty that within us which in the end is all that matters.
Christina ,muito obrigado por toda força que essa música proporcionou e ainda proporciona a milhares de pessoas . É muito doloroso o processo de aceitação e indentificação,essa canção nos trás um conforto imenso e nos aproxima cada vez mais de vc como um ser humano sensacional ! Gratidão 🙏❤️
NOTHING CHANGED. Or, yeah, we have the Internet and hate is louder. Everything is shittier than back then.
Glad Im aware of educational background being a leverage over physical looks as advantages or whatsoever. prioritizing looks is never a thing from poverty, seems like a 1st world country problem.
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Forever the best! This song is going to live for centuries. Thank you for showing the ugly and distracting side of the internet and media through this song. Christina, so waiting for you in Armenia on 22nd of October!
Muy bonito
I admire Christina and her whole story, but Now we'll have to listen to 20 years of beautiful music, I was expecting something new😔 But she still lives in the strep era
Lindo ❤
2002 you was way ahead of your time ❤👌🏼
Such an important message.
Quando eu tinha 16 anos, essa musica salvou a minha vida. Foi a primeira vez que eu pude me ver em um clipe sem ser julgado, me sentindo representado. Stripped sempre sera especial na minha vida, obrigado Christina.
Wow wow Que carajos¡!!! ME ENCANTOOOOOOO😍🥰😍🥰😍🥰😍
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Legend!!!! Such an important message ❤️
Thanks Xtina! :3
This is a great message and all but where is Christina I wanted to see her
What a beautiful message ❤
2002: Be you! 💕  2022: get off your phone and go outside! 🥰
Está canción salvó mi vida de tantas maneras cuando descubría mi propia vida, y es bueno ver qué el mensaje sigue salvando vidas 20 años después, en especial en esta época donde la presión social en linea afecta negativamente nuestra autoestima. No importa la epoca, tu eres hermoso y no importan lo que ellos digan... ¡Ese es el mensaje! ❤️ Por eso y más Christina Aguilera siempre tendra mi apoyo, amor y respeto.
🤍
Such a strong message, love yourself, your mind and your body 💝
Love love love
Every Time what i watch i cry
Yes Queen, Lo hiciste nuevamente, esta canción significa tanto para nosotros.
Brilliant video.
Wowwwww😢❤
Perfeito 🇧🇷
LOVE YOU QUEEN
Thank you, Christina 💐 Thank you, Linda Perry 💐 Thank you, director Fiona Jane 💐 What a BEAUTIFUL message 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Sufrí mucho bulling en la secundaria por ser gay  justo en esos años en Mtv veía el video con el cual me identificaba, en casa había pobreza, violencia, rechazo, no sabía que hacer en todas partes era lo mismo el video me dio muchas fuerzas estaba a punto del suicidio no quería vivir, ahora solo son malos recuerdos. Thank you CHRISTINA AGUILERA.. te amaré y te seguiré siempre es una promesa que hice, agradeciéndote que por ti estoy viva y no salí por la puerta falsa ❤️
WOW. this song changed my life in many many ways. hope it does the same to other young women now ❤
BRAVO DEVOJKO
20 years have passed and the messages are still true. Thank you Stripped for saving my life and brought me to the better place and made me the best version of myself today. Xtina, I Love you.
Always giving great messages to us and specially the gen z
Don’t you bring me down today 2022
You saved my life this song…  ❤️ 2002❤️
20 anos de beautiful e continua mais atual do que nunca. Agradeço imensamente por essa música e o clipe em 2002, me acolhendo e me mostrando que minha sexualidade não me torna um monstro e que eu não estava sozinho. Um sopro de auto estima num mundo tão cruel.
Wow amazing ❤ so true then and today
Omg! 😢 I loved this video
So thankful I didn't have/use social media growing up...and I still don't today. 🧡
This song never gets old it's gold ~ ❤️
Simplesmente amei
Esta canción es un himno
OUI.... Fantastique merci
❤️‍🔥💋❤️‍🔥💋❤️‍🔥💋❤️‍🔥💋💋❤️‍🔥💋👑👑👑👑
just as i was looking for this song..saw it was re released
❤️❤️❤️
Excelente video... La verdad este estereotipos de cuerpos nos están llevando a la perdición, a no amarnos como somos.... Que triste
😭😭😭😭😭🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Chorei 😥😥😥 Sempre amei a Artista e Humana certa . Christina Aguilera você é tão necessária
Made me cry all over again.
❤❤❤
We are one and beautiful in every single way
Funny video coming from someone who uses heavy makeup (except for a few months during the promotion of “Liberation”) and treatments like injections and body fat transfer to achieve a certain look. The original was less woke and actually felt more genuine.
She literally never misses
A very touching video that shows how even the smallest ones needs to  look for that perfection that doesn't exist and it's showed by the TV,  advertising or social media, everyone have the right to live as they want, without tags, bullying, sadness and stupid beauty standards, live happy no matter what is what it counts, thanks Christina for show us again that we are always Beautiful 😭😭😘❤️❤️🙌
Woooow. It’s keep impacting me ❤
What a powerful message this video is bringing back. ❤
Thank you so much. This song means everything to me (and 100000 others) I love you forever, queen 🖤 🖤 🖤 🖤
Ninguna cancion me ha ayudado tanto como Beautiful
timeless
The cellphone bledding is key. There were always the same problems, not feeling enough about the stereotypes, over time it evolved in the ways in which it occurs. And someone had to do it, give the message of you are not alone.
.EXACTLY.. literally go out and touch grass. Look at people around you. lol
💝
we needed a rerecorded version :(
OMG great song ando great message, it's  hard to say peoples opinión doesnt matter but for our mental healt it's important ignore all that and be our best
Thank you again...cried like the first time I heard this song. Speechless.
20 years and the message still looks son new
Thanks Christina and Linda Perry for remembering us we are beautiful as we are, we do not need the standards that social media is showing and spreading. We need to teach this to children and teenagers.
hermosa version el videoclip te emociona
I wish xtina was in the video. But it was awesome! Love it!
Me has hecho llorar de nuevo. Te amo Christina.
What makes me really sad is to know times haven't changed at all 🙁🙁🙁🙁
No like
Que bien mensaje
The video's final message is extremely important! 👏👏👍
Esta canción es un himno. I love Christina
Aún no lo he visto y ya se que va a ser encantador❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 💯🔥🤩
Probably even more powerful and touching than 20 years ago.  I cried all my tears watching this music video. Thanks, Christina for always caring about people, especially the littlest and most vulnerable ones.
"Beautiful" est un hymne à la tolérance et au respect. ❤️ Thank you xtina 💗
queriendo ser en ocaciones como lo que vemos
Love u and ur music
Love it, lo amé. ❤️❤️❤️
Love it !!!
love it <3
Uma das músicas pops mais potentes e clipe lindo ❤️
El mensaje siempre será el mismo, sé tú mismo/a. No necesitas una aprobación para agradar en ningún ámbito social, se libre… haz lo que quieras y que nada ni nadie te pisotee VALES MUCHO ❤ repítetelo siempre que te veas al espejo 🙌🏽
AMAZING!
Quem é esse negão  gostoso?  Quero o Instagram  dele
LINDA TE AMO MULHER
Recuerdo cuando tenia 12 años,  cuando vi que en un tiempo futuro cambiarían las cosas y así fue, artistas como Xtina fueron una gran inspiración para que muchos no nos dejáramos vencer.... Gracias CA love u
Is so beautifulllll for ever , i Will remenber the past. Xtina tanks  so much.
I never get tired of listening to it. Immortal masterpiece.
WOOW IN 2002 . WOWW IN 2022 🥺
El verdadero Arte NUNCA muere. Esta joya no tiene caducidad, gracias Christina por estos 20 años de tremenda obra maestra.
La sociedad a cambiado de manera drástica 😢 tanto que para gustar debes ser apuesta/o, tener dinero, un estatus, el amor al prójimo y la empatía rara vez se dejan notar, la libertad de expresión, el temor a herir con palabras a quienes más amas, EL RACISMO… cada vez que escucho “Beautifull” independientemente de las lagrimas me da cierta esperanza de que el mundo cambie 😔 yo vivo diario con ese nudo en la garganta… creemos conciencia para agradar no se necesita una aprobación 🙏
This song and message are immortal and I cry every time I hear it. I've seen Christina live 5 times and cried EVERY TIME. This song saved me and changed my self perception forever and I'm thankful for that! Such a masterpiece! Thank you, Linda Perry and Christina Aguilera for helping me with my mental health. 💜
Que lindo el mensaje de este video. Le dice a los niños y jóvenes que no se adelanten a su época. Lamentablemente las generaciones de hoy las están haciendo que vivan adelantados a su edad y eso solo les crea trastornos.
Hermosa canción como siempre sigue transmitiendo muchos mensajes positivos para tomar conciencia .. gracias por este hermoso video
Muy bueno el mensaje Chris, con un clásico de canción.
👏This version is even better than the original. Christina delivers a timeless message that gains new deep meanings decades after.👏
The anthem...
Tan impactante como hace 20 años. Gracias Xtina por mostrarnos una vez mas  la cruda realidad de nuestros tiempos. 🥺❤️
Xtina trying to change humanity but humanity is already lost.
Es un himno que se mantiene vigente a pesar de los años. Distintas épocas, pero el mismo mensaje de siempre. Gracias Christina ❤️👑
Chorei. Por isso ela não tá no topo das paradas. A mídia atual é porca e não conseguem admitir as verdades que ela trás nos vídeos dela. Sempre afrente do seu tempo. Esse vídeo se fez muito necessário, principalmente nos dias de hoje. Obrigado X-tina por não esquecer da gente! Nem dos antigos, e nem da nova geração. Você é necessária! <3
Te re amo Xtina Xtina XTINAAAA ❤️❤️❤️ Saludos desde #Uruguay 🇺🇾
Thank you for this
This video is dedicated to new generations.
❤❤❤
❤❤
Well done Christina for this powerful video and message 🥰🥹
Queen
que mensagem forte tem esse vídeo
More than great and meaningful music, you really do have a good heart that CARES for people especially children. I wanna do the same with my craft as well. Thank you so much for being such an inspiration to us all. More power to you Christina Aquilera! 💪💪💯💯👏👏
Epicness
Thanks for making me a Fighter ❤
Somos hermosos gracias a ti XTINA❤🧡💛💜💙💚🖤
Llore nuevamente 😢 hermosa canción 😍 creo que cualquiera se puede sentir identificado, saludos cordiales desde Chile 🇨🇱
Que fuerte pero era necesario en estos tiempos por nuestros niños nuestros adolescentes y nuestros jóvenes de esta generación por el grito de libertad que merecen y no cerrandolos en una cárcel llamado vida virtual
This song is still so relevant, and always will be! A classic.
Well done Christina for this powerful video
Best music video with a social message
BRAVO!!😍😍😍😍😍
Perfect
20 years later and I'm  still emotional.
I love you Queen
Perfeita demais , eu escolhi a cantora certa para amar 💞💞💞💞
I love u Xtina! Forever in my mind! ❤️
Este tipo de música y vídeos es que hacen a Christina diferente a los demás, ella tiene mucha empatía por el dolor y felicidad de los demás, dirán que está infravalorada, pero la industria actual es la que no se fija en esto, adicionalmente el mundo es el que no valora el corazón y el alma, se vá más a lo material, físico y  superficial.   ¡Ojalá lo mire Britney Spears!  ¡Gracias mi Xtina!
❤❤❤❤
I’m crying 😢😢😢
Grande Christina
Ame está nueva versión del video me hace sentir más seguro de mi mismo y que debo de amarme primero a mi y que debo de estar bien conmigo mismo sin importar lo que la gente diga y  piensen de mi físico orientación sexual etc etc ❤️
powerful!!
we need this song today
Hermoso video. Una canción que 20 años después sigue moviendo conciencias y corazones.
So I am in process of losing weight (Obesity Grade 3) and I've been struggling a lot with my mental health (anxiety and depression) the final message about social media is nothing but the truth. Nowdays I am healing because I found my inner light, that love that I neglected myself so much through time because of fear or shame, to the people reading this please do it for you and nobody else.   I heard this song 20 years ago, and now in my 30s I feel so much better because of artists like Christina, she is even one of my biggest inspirations in singing/music (I'm a singer/musician) so THANK YOU SO MUCH CHRISTINA I send you so much love from ECUADOR! ♥   I am prepared to be my best version, thank you and 100000000 times thank you!
Gracias Linda Perri, gracias Christina Aguilera
Que crítica social linda. Beautiful sempre atemporal
XTINA ALWAYS USING HER VOICE FOR GOOD CAUSES I LOVE HER
Incrível q essa é atual  , obrigado christina por não esquecer esse hino
Beautiful
Gracias por salvar mi vida.💜👌
The best song by Christina
this makes me so emotional… 20 years after this woman still have impact on the new generation w positive message
que perfeição! me dá um baita orgulho ela usar o relançamento para levantar algo tão importante, a saude mental em especial das crianças e adolescentes. melhor de tudo é que uma música lançada há 20 anos se encaixa perfeitamente pro cenário. XTINA sempre a frente do seu tempo! ❤
Tenias que hacerme llorar??? Amé este video ahora me siento tan entoxicado 😭😭😭
Decir que e llorado seria poco! Es una ola de sentimientos encontrados ! Muchas Gracias Cristhina Aguilera por darnos esto! Una vez mas
La canción sigue transmitiendo como hace 20 años, pero el video original insuperable
❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful video BUT wanted new vocals too
Remélem sok fiatal nézetét sikerül megváltoztatnod!❤️🙏 Sajnos ez ma nagyon is aktuális!😥
*I love you Cristina Aguilera Thank you for once again bringing this hit in 2022 that people have freedom to be who they really are 😍🇧🇷👍🏼🥲 I love you*
🙏Thank you for sharing that impressive video and good song!! Like that so much!! Respect from Lithuania!! 🙌
Meu deus como a christina é necessaria.
i love you xtina :)
💕💕💕💕💕💕💋
Excelente Christina Aguilera excelente video han pasado 20 años y este es un himno a la comunidad gay
Xtina, te amo pra sempre! ❤️
My youth years queen 👑
An old song that feels new all over again.
Literally sobbing! When I first saw the original video, I felt seen and appreciated. This song is such an anthem to so many and the message remains timeless 🤍  FOREVER a fighter
Gracias por llevar este mensaje de amor propio
Gracias Christina por ser la Luz y prevalecer tu talento entre tanta miseria del panorama actual musical que normalizan lo malo y le llaman bueno.
beautiful song and beautiful video💖
Hermosa canción 🎵. Hermoso mensaje ❤ Grande reina. Por darnos tanta música con contenido y actual viva CHRISTINA ✨✨✨✨❤️❤️🇨🇱
Himno indiscutible.  Beautiful icónica y trascendental por los años de los años. Gracias Xtina por tanto arte 🙏🏼👑💯❤️Te amo Reina
Obra de arte musicalmente y todo el contenido letra audiovisual impactante la imagen del cel con la sangre.Aplausos
💜💜💜
Stripped changed my life ♥
AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL❤️😍🙏
colombian te espera con los.brazos abiertos !!!
Escuchar esta canción cuando tenía alrededor de 12 años, me hizo entender que estaba bien ser yo, y que no debía dejar que nadie opinara de otra cosa acerca de mí... GRACIAS por este himno que a muchos nos dio paz, libertad y principalmente hacernos sentir ¡Felices! 🌈
😍😍
Bravo que gran verdad como siempre xtina entregando arte puro ❤️👌🙌
Muito perfeito! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💖💖💖
Awww🥲
Podia pelo menos ter regravado a música né, custava nada...
Legendary
😭😭😭😭😭
Same energy same issue in a different time this what you call a true talent a true narrator keep up the good work my Kwween
Masterpiece
Its hard to breathe, now and then i get insecure…
I get the idea of the updated video with all thats going on right now. But why not also record an updated version with new lyrics and a new beat? such a missed opportunity
Gurl? The world was need this video. Thank you for exist. 🖤
Girl… where are you?
Thank you Queen for this!!! Beautiful is a masterpiece, you are gold! You save many lifes with your voice! thank u forever❤
You made me cry! This is so beautiful! I didn’t know I wasn’t ready for it! You really made me cry. I needed it. Thanks baby
Beautiful!
Ευχαριστούμε X - Tina
Been waiting for the new version. Im grateful that Beautiful has been and will continue to be a part of my life. Im gay since I was born just came out recently because I know myself its the right thing to do. If I don't go out I won't grow and learn and If didnt do it what will happen is I will fool myself for the rest of my life. Lemme tell you something. If you love yourself, your parents and the people around you, there is nothing wrong with you. And as long as you can be a good person, keep going because there is no gender discrimination to be a good person and a good example. You are loved you are special and that is something that will never be taken from you. Hugs! 💜💜😘😘
Forever a life-saving life-changing classic
Thank you ❤
The 2002 music video was much better
❤❤❤❤
This song is a healing balm.
Reina de Reinan, Christina Aguilera Voz de la Generación ❤️, Ven a latinoamerica pliss 🇨🇱 🇵🇪 🇧🇷 🇦🇷 🇪🇨
I'm here, my queen
🤍🤍🤍🤍
PODIA SER MELHOR....
gran mensaje 🏵❤‍🩹💪🫂
Oh my god. I love it. love from italy!
Es grandiosa la manera como expones la situacion CRITICA que estan viviendo los niños, jovenes y hasta los mismos adultos con repecto a la "perfeccion" que muestran las redes sociales y el efecto tan negativo que esta dejando en la sociedad, las redes sociales se han convertido en un 95% una glorificación a una perfeccion inexistente y un 5% a comunicar! Gracias por alzar la voz y mostrar que un niño es mas feliz y sano disfrutando de su niñez jugando con sus amigos, compartiendo y VIVIENDO su etapa como lo que son.. niños 💕💕💕
❤
Always makes me cry! Thank you for this message once again. You are amazing ❤
We are beautiful no matter what they say.
me hace sentir tan bien  desde niño desde que escuche por primera vez está canción sentí que en algún momento yo sería libre y mi familia me aceptaría como soy y a si fue mi familia me ama y yo los amo ellos. gracias xtina
New generation new consequences
Soy de los que piensa que se debe mantener a los niños lo más lejos posible de las redes sociales. Gracias Christina Aguilera por recordarnos 20 años despues que aún somos hermosos sin importar lo que digan los demás 🤍
beautiful ❤️💕❤️
20 years ago Christina Aguilera released her sophomore album 'Stripped'. Now, she has released a new video for the song 'Beautiful' –which to this day the song is still very relevant and important. I had tears watching the new video, and memories took back when the first video came out as I did not understand everything about it. And, as the years gone by, this became my anthem as a gay person and as a human. To show respect and love to everyone. To me, the word 'beautiful' is important. As the lyric says, 'I am beautiful no matter what they say'. Thank you, Christina. Everyday, you are my inspiration, especially the album. How I conquer my individuality, my sexuality and my life. You have gave me strength, respect and love. I will be forever your supporter. I love you!!! ***I am crying while writing this. 😭😭😭
THIS SONG DESERVED TO BECOME #1 AGAIN !!
I LOVE YOU CHRISTINA AGUILERA.  🇧🇷
Great work
Maravilloso.... eres increíble Xtina Te amo. 💋❤
The fact that you use your voice, your art to spread these powerful messages is the reason why you are a Living Legend Christina Aguilera!! We need to protect you at all costs
❤❤❤
Es increible que despues del 2002 las cosas solo mejoraron un 50 por ciento, porque ahora tenemos que enfrentarnos a los libertarios, a los conservadores que han vuelto y a la supremacia religiosa que quieren llegar a todos los poderes del mundo para convertirlo a peor, viendo como un idolo a Putin que no es mas un asesino e hipocrita de lo ultimo, esta cancion es una voz, es un llamado a evitarlo, que lo necesitamos para buscar inspiracion y fuerza con el objetivo de salir al mundo y cambiarlo a un mundo mejor en donde se hable de la salud mental, de la libre personalidad de la gente, de la salud, de la salud sexual, del bullyng en redes sociales como en la vida real...y un sin fin de temas mas que necesitamos resolver cuanto antes, este video refleja lo que se vive hoy en dia y esta cancion que mas que una vuelta al pasado es un presente tambien. Juntos somos mas contra la maldad. I Love You Christina, desde Venezuela with Love y cariño
Will never forget how your music and voice saved my life Christina. I kept my faith, and seeing this for this new generation, just WOW ❤. Music heals.
Beautiful message. Love you Christina Aguilera
Gracias Christina por esta hermosa canción y el mensaje, siempre adelantada🤗💜
The first one still is better. This one does not hit the spot
When you cannot pull out new hits, you reissue the old ones. Good job, Floppina! 🤣🤣🤣
So so BEAUTIFUL 😍 Xtina Inspiration 🙏🏻
OUR ANTHEM ❤
Thank you for the powerful message Xtina!!!
Christina Aguilera Queen ❤️👍🏻👑
I'm in tears again, after 10 years. Thanks for this, Christina

GRACIAS ❤️
Quando eu tinha 12 anos eu estava passando por um momento difícil em relação a minha sexualidade e julgamentos por eu estar me descobrindo gay, só Deus sabe o que eu passei. E você, com essa e muitas outras músicas salvou a minha vida! Você foi e continua sendo importante pra mim até hoje, em 2022. Eu te amo!
Crying 😢 This is such a relevant updated video the song ❤ Thank you.
Oofale.  I thought it was gonna be a new version vocally as well.
XTINA 🖤 I LOVE YOU

Meu Deus, que forte! Que necessário! Por isso amo essa mulher!
Just when I thought I couldn’t love this woman more … here she comes with this amazing video/message. I am so proud to be an OG Fighter, I really hope today’s youth finds comfort, support, and hope in this video just like I did 20 years ago. Xtina, I love you!!!!!
A song forever ❤
So proud of You Christina!!!   #20yearsOfStripped 🤩🤩✨✨
Love💜
🥰🥰🥰🥰
YOU KEEP GIVING HOPE AND STRENGTH FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LOST IT
Nos momentos mais difíceis da minha vida.. foi "beautiful" que me levantou. CHRISTINA AGUILERA, EU TE AMO! 👑
❤❤❤❤❤
Legend 👑 love You Xtina ❤️
Recuerdo claramente cuando hace 20 años atrás, este vídeo y esa canción me dieron fuerzas para aceptar que no estaba mal ser yo mismo y continuar. Espero que lo mismo le suceda a los jóvenes de hoy y que también encuentren en el legado de esta canción la fuerza y valentía para no dejar que nada, ni nadie los haga sentir menos.  I truly hope this video to have the same positive and cheerful impact on kids nowadays that the previous one had on me 20 years ago. God bless Xtina for speaking issues only a few speak about. Greetings and blessings to all of you from Venezuela.
This version of "Beautiful" is very reminiscent of TLC's "Unpretty". Both are captivating. Well done.
Really love how this music video highlights that kids should just be kids and should be having fun.
Omg I got so emotional!
🤍🤍🤍
Me hizo llorar 🥺😭
😢😢😢
So powerful!!! This song has saved so many lives during these 20 years and I'm sure it will continue to do so. No words, just legendary 🛐
Christina Aguilera sempre muito necessária! Te amo <3 O clipe tá lindo, super emocionante.
CADÊ A XTINA NO VÍDEO?
NO NECESITA UN #1 EN BILLBOARD PARA DEMOSTRAR QUE EL TALENTO Y EL CONTENIDO SE ENCUENTRA EN MUY POCOS ARTISTAS Y ELLA ES UNO DE ESOS
WOW! THIS IS SO POWERFUL!!!!!
Esta canción ❤ pueden pasar siglos y el mensaje sigue más vigente que nunca!
Current and powerful twenty years later ❤️❤️❤️
Ay Xtina siempre haciendo las cosas bien! Te amo y gracias por crear una maravilla que por años mi alma usa como refugio. Eres lo mejor del mundo.
This song is MY ANTHEM!!! I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
Ame este video 100/100
This song saved so many lives!! Thank you so much Xtina 💙
Lenda que sempre esteve a frente do seu tempo. Há 20 anos atrás essa mensagem já foi muito importante pra toda uma geração.
I cried
Beautifullll ♥️
Made me cry 20 years ago and has the same effect today, beautiful song, beautiful people.
Beautiful song, but still we see that what they sing is not what they are, because Christina indeed did some esthetics in her face, at least she injected her lips. Nothing against it, but it feels wrong to give a message that you do not even follow.
🤍🤍🤍
Aún recuerdo cuando hace veinte años regresaba a casa de la escuela, en donde por cierto, sufría de acoso escolar, y ponía en mi grabadora el disco de Stripped, sin duda era mi válvula de escape a esa realidad tan cruel. Como hace veinte años, este video me conmueve hasta las lágrimas. Gracias, Christina, por haberme hecho un luchador
Always, The message... QUEEN Xtina 🌹
Xtina #Stripped era finally getting recognized by Gen-Z, we love that ❤️💯
Que hermosa.... Me vuelve a transportar 20 años atrás
Thankyou xtina!❤
Aaaw 😍👑 💞
Só tenho a agradecer
Always have a space in my heart. 💯❤️💪💅
Música da vida😍
I cry and i can’t stop …😭😭
I love you Christina Aguilera, you are my favorite artist of all time. I love you soooo much.
Te amo Christina esta canción lo es todo para este tiempo tal superficial en el que vivimos 💓
We are beatiful!
Ecuador te amamos
The message is so powerful as always...it brought tears in my eyes AGAIN!!!
This is so necessary. Xtina, YOU ARE NECESSARY. This video made me cry, since my teenage years were during the 2000's I've felt this.
I love the message...it brought me back in 2002...also reminds me of TLC's Unpretty MV...great job xtina!!!
Beautiful!!! <3
La reina jamás se ha ido
Love it! ❤❤❤❤❤

I’m not a cryer but this had me sobbing thinking about how much my childhood was wasted comparing myself to other kids, magazines, artists, living on my phone. Love yourself people! You are so loved and perfect the way you are. Thanks Christina for this. Stripped will forever be iconic as well as all of your other work. Liberation and Lotus are underrated and Aguilera is needed on vinyl. Please and thank you kween!
Um hino de quando me senti liberta ,de todas dificuldades que já tive , realmente ouvir esse som é libertador ...onde hj em dia vc só vê inveja de quem as vezes não tem nada de vc e só quer o seu brilho ... parabéns Christina Aguilera pelo lindo trabalho
Never gets old.
Gracias por este nuevo video, te amamos  Christina

💖💖💖💖
Cuando tenia 12 años esta canción me cambió la vida. El vídeo para mí fue liberador y me hizo sentir amado en un México homofóbico. Era como si al verlo una y otra vez simplemente me sintiera libre. Esta nueva versión no sexualizada y sin clichés es hermosa, de verdad casi lloro. Gracias Xtina y gracias Linda Perry.
Now release the Brujería music video for Día de Muertos!!!!
Admirable! Nunca me desilusionas. Adaptaste el video a la realidad de hoy día. TE AMO ♥
hermoso mensaje XTINA 🥰
esos mismos roles de belleza los ponen artistas como Christina que siempre salen con cuerpos perfectos y caras super maquilladas, ahora resulta que ellos quieren ser el antidoto cuando el mundo del espectaculo eso es lo que promueve.
