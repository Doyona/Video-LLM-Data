I was so disappointed in moving to Kent and my golf game left me as family and work...I was lucky enough to play Woburn many times with Charlie and and jnr...I miss that course 😭😭 12 years without swinging a bat...I'm starting a you tube channel lol.
Great match. Poulter is a real entertainer and class golfer
1:42:55
Loved it, great video.
Good belly laugh watching this. Thanks 😂
I turned it off after the 6th n the uphill putt WTF - I wanted you to do better! Your putt was terrible. I hope you did better on the back 9. You need to lose about 14lbs to but I still; enjoy your channel. Keep on going ..... just slow down on the bacon butties.
If I closed my eyes I would swear Rick is playing Rod Stewart.
3 to go…4 ya spanner
I am convinced Rick is trying to be David Brent at every chance he gets
What an incredible gent Ian Poulter is! How many people have been inspired by his character and presence as a golfer alone is crazy 🙌🏻
Only spoilt by the amount of ads.
That was a great video. Woburn is a really hard course as proved here. Really entertaining and educational too.
Ian Poulter, what a legend! When he covered his face whilst losing it at 1:43:03 after Rick hit the tree... I literally LOLed 🤣🤣🤣 Great video Rick. All the love from South Africa!
Relatively new to you channel (I know, i know, where have I been all this time) Massive fan of Poulter anyway but that was a great match, Coulter was born to be on camera but loved hearing his thought process and his guidance. Great video
Poulter was always my English fave growing up. It's so nice to see he's such a gent, great banter, having a good time. Awesome video Rick.
The entertainment was great, the golf was absolutely dog egg
Mr Poulter, class act!
Absolutely love that video fantastic golf fair play to Ian
That chip off the path but more importantly the decision making process from a pro is amazing to hear and something I wouldn’t even think about. Very interesting indeed!
1:42:10 Pure comedy
This was awesome, Ian was amazing 👏
Bryson needs to team up with Ian. His commentary is always cheeky & absolutely hilarious. Dude has personality for miles.
I love this... Ian and Rick made this so much fun... Ian with all his course knowledge... was brilliant
Rick is terrible at golf lol painful
Enjoyed that so much , but mr poults is just to hot with that putter ! Hard luck bud , you deserved a half 😁
Mustard!!!loved it !!!
Poulter was fantastic in this. Has he OCD or just a  perfectionist? Never seen someone clean clubs or path to pin  so much
Is ricks handicap 10?
Legend.
Now that's why it is a gentleman's game !  What amazing manners, humbleness and sportsmanship. I.P much respect!!!!!!
I find myself saying "Oh Rick" in a disappointing tone at least 3 or 4 times video.
i love your vids nd u but the fact i have to watch an ad every 5 minutes is disgusting especially on 1hr plus videos
Wow what beautiful golf course. Tree lined fairways are a real challenge. Ian is a legend and a nice fellow.
Awesome video. Ian is cool as fuck.
This was very well done. Poulter seemed like he actually had a good time.
Rick, You must start working on your game from 50 yards and in. From there forward it is absolutely horrific.
I think Ian was in holiday mode until the 17th! Absolute Legend!!
Big fan of Pouter and thanks fir this Rick. Very enjoyable and educational 🏌️‍♂️
You could have played loud music and thrown some beer cans around to make it more LIVVY 😅
New found appreciation for Ian after this one. He's a year older than me, and is in 10x better shape.
I love watching these -I haven’t watched a golf tourney in years ( except for live events).. I love the chatter & the front row seat of the decision making ..  I have to say, however, I call BS on Rick’s handicap - we are supposedly the same handicap and on any regular course ( Angeles nation, for instance ) from the blues or tips he would literally wipe the floor with me - if he is not a plus handicap then we need to get him a therapist - haha - when I watched his full swing instruction video, all I could think was “ just give me that swing & I can die a happy man !”   Keep making these videos
Super videos. Bravo. 👍 Having played my golf in the 70's - 90's I do laugh at the range binoculars things, that give you the yardage, actual and  what it's playing. We used to call it 'feel' 😂
Match play may have been better?
I’ve got so much respect for Poults. What a guy would love to play a hole with him
I felt the missed puts and the zip back miss. 😆
When ever I play with a guy that takes multiple provisionals;, I tell him "the driving range is over there."
I’ve seen better cat 2’s at 11  years of age-to be honest.Rick. Simon khan & Oliver fisher come to mind.Vinnie Cox Paul Sullivan, Chris Goddard, mark Bishop.Lee jones, The list is endless. Are you cat 1?
While disappointed that PXG and Cleveland weren’t reviewed and skipping all the PING fanbois trying to justify their purchase at that crazy price point for just the name…IMO the average golfer buys based on exactly what your review focused on performance, looks and price. Great job Rick!
Worst I’ve see Rick play
Awesome game!! You are the back nine guy!!👍
What a bloke Ian Poulter is. For a video that’s nearly 2 hours long I was engrossed for all of it! Top content! 😃
Not all heroes wear capes,well done Dr thank you Avi
Anyone else think Poults sounds like the ‘Come fly with me’ easy-jet programme narrator? Haha Cracking content Rick!
Was not a fan of Ian during the first half or so of his career. Just out of ignorance and me being young. Nothing on Ian. Watched his hour with Fehrety a few years ago and he flipped me, became one of my favorite players. This video moves him into my top 5. From Indiana, US. Well done Rick & Ian
Fantastic content you two
I loved this match !!!
Awesome video. Can you please trace second shots of the Pros you feature too? They have the skill to shape shots and having the visuals will really show that.
That laugh of Ian on 16 made my day. 😊😊😊
He said, just think Medina I literally live five minutes away from there  And I make deliveries there too  It’s a beautiful golf course, but the clubhouse is fantastic and it’s Morrish in design
100% honesty here, I’ve always felt IP was an absolute A-hole. This video has changed my mind. Well done. Having his son there is a nice touch. Loved all of his thoughts even though not always pulled off.
Ads every 2 minutes really destroys this video!
Apparently Rick Shields is a scratch golfer..
This is my third time watching Rick play. So far he hasn’t played well. He has many followers so I’ll keep watching to see if he improves.
This video in my opinion has been the best 10 under challenge with the pros.  It’s seeing the hilarious and witty side of Ian together with the unbelievable good looking Woburn course with tall trees as well as the video clarity that just did it for me.  Thanks, Rick.   Awesome job.
Ian a great guy. Great to see him kick back.
A few more trees and it ll be pretty established
Great watch and what a nice guy.
2nd time of watching this and enjoyed it as much as l did the first time! 👍💪👊⛳️
Best I have seen, thank you for this excellent content! He's a legend and just an all round great lad.. Just brilliant!
Great 2 shots on 18 Rick!
"I'm Ian Poulter. And I'm in the game!"  Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2006!
Rick, your short game is laughable. You should never practice anything until you can hit a 30 yard pitch.
No way!
That was really really great, well done guys
Minute 1:56
I would love to see a Tiger/Ian match
Think I might be watching too much youtube golf.. at 1:42:10 same shot as Dan Grieves lates video... https://youtu.be/3SvDYlhQXAc?si=7seKYgOGsOPUfh1a&t=3849
I could see that Rick has the swing and the ability to win this match. But  he clearly did not handle his nervousness well. So his concentration was poor in the first 3 holes which made him very likely to lose. He is a low handicap player and scored 82. I enjoyed listening to Ian's comments before each shot. He should have scored better. Rick talked far too much and giggled a lot after his unfunny comments - a bit annoying. But it was a vg show overall.
2 club twerls
Course looks very difficult... well played Rick
Hello Rick I have been enjoying your videos for a while now , I am a 78 year old with the same initials so was wondering where the headcovers came from
This is definitely the best one. Ian Poulters thought process, insights and coaching is world class. Would love to see the rematch ❤
Ive always loved Ian for his stoicism. And he certainly showed that vs you in this video
Great content Ian is a legend genuine nice bloke
No way Rick is a scratch golfer
Really enjoyed that, brilliant challenge
That last hole was brilliant. Rick really is the northern David Brent 😂
Loved this.   What a great round with a legend and gent in equal measure.  Epic
3:52 bring a ball with you 😂
I see Rod Stewart when Ian speaks, anyone else hear it ?
It was great to see and hear you and Ian talk about each shot and help each other through was great.  I've had the pleasure of playing at Woburn on a company golf day as an absolutely useless beginner, with borrowed clubs, and enjoyed every single second of that wonderful place.
This video was simply compulsive viewing, I was blown away by what a lovely bloke Ian Poulter is and the banter between you both. Great content Rick and well played, just loving these challenges.
How is this fella a pro
Jaw-droppingly good!
Look at xrp vs sol chart, and tell me who is garbage
Best guest yet!
It`s nice to see these guys from a completely different perspective. I got tickled at the last two or three holes, when his demeanor changed and his shots became more accurate. Thanks Rick.
Ian looking dead into camera with head shakes and stuff is classic stuff.  Reminds me of Jim from the office.  So entertaining 😊😊
What a beautiful golf course and Ian Poulter, a legend of a nice bloke. Great video!
Poultry = huge cvnt ✔️
Lovely to see Poulter without his cap having a good laugh.
“These are just warm up shots” my go to every game! Haha
Trump looked at the caddie and said, “good call” after hitting what looked like a 7 iron might’ve been an 8. Directly onto the green about 10’ from the hole! He gives credit where credit is due! He didn’t say, look at me at what I did and how great I am! Nope. He gave that excellent shot to the caddie! What a guy. He went to high five him after the last hole. Then said, nope! And walked off haha!
No way ricks a scratch golfer 🤣
Awesome round
Obvious why Ian is a fan favorite. Sorry, favourite. Question, Rick marked his ball with a tee on the tenth green. I've never seen that before. Is that normal?
Ian is such a character😂
Who cares if you can beat him or your grandmother?
@1:07:53 LOL Love this guy - Got to see Ian playing the 2004 Par 3 Tournament at The Masters - Fun player to watch and great to see him still doing well.
Absolutely loved finding out Ian Poulter is exactly the bloke i thought he would be. What a legend.
Bro haven’t seen Rick without his hat on hairline is crazy bad
What a great guy poults is ! Great vid 👍🏼, I’m now into trees 😂
Mr. Poulter laughing at 1:42:57 has my dying. Great video!
Ian Poulter was always one of my favorite Euro pros.
That's what we like to hear...excuses.
im here to see rick hit that tree and Ian piss himself :L
@1:31:50 RICK IS ONE OF US!!!!
Great video Rick …🎉
I don’t think I’ve ever seen an eagle putt left that short 😅 next time 🫶
Rick shields is never a scratch golfer
This was Excellent Content. Mr. Poultier was perfect in every way you would imagine a bucket list challenge to be. Great job Gentlemen.👌🏾
Yhe comments say it all
I had gone off Poults but he's won me back. Great video
But your bitcoin at okx
A masterclass in course management!
Great match on a great track!
Watching Rick play makes me feel better about my game 😂. Watching his instruction videos// i thought he would strike the ball better.
I think you should have double bogey on the 17th
Ian is phenomenal on camera
No matter your age, do a trade and stop golfing. I’m worth 23 million and justedades ground stumps at 1 of my properties
Love this, Ian poulters such a lad, what an amazing day this looks. Waht mote would ya want in life 🤌
Rick Schiels continues to deliver great content!! Love the Legends Series!! All of them are legends! Rick Schiels needs to NOT HINGE HIS WRISTS SOO MUCH TOWARDS THE TOP OF HIS BACKSWING!! RICK SCHIELS NEEDS TO SLOW HIS TEMPO DOWN JUST A BIT 😁
1:42:55 one of the funniest youtube moments, ever?
Even Poulters Mrs gives it the “Don’t you know who I am” in shops. I was behind her once when her card got declined. 😂😂😂
Poulter probably got paid. I'm sure rick pays people to spend time with him. Like guy lol
I am really enjoying all these matches, and Rick is a great host. One question. I see Rick fairly often stepping behind the hole, often in the line of his opponent, should he miss long. I always thought the line extended past the hole a few feet. or does that matter in a more casual 'unofficial' match? Either way, these are great matches.
Ian , what a legend , you need your own channel .
Brilliant ⛳️
Rick, new driver please!
Kirkland signature, let's gooooo! 👊
Definitely the funnest one to watch yet. Ian was a blast. So close, Rick!
Taking part in the Prostate Cancer UK Golf Marathon in August, currently playing with my 8 year old Callaway Strata set and it's seen better days so some new irons would be lovely 😂
IP is such a natural for YT golf!!
I gotta try these.  Too curious.
Was the weather the same for both players??????
One of your best videos Rick
I don't know why, but Ian reminds me of Rod Stewart😉
I laughed so hard when he laughed at the tree thunk! So good. What a legend Poulter.
I think the majority of us KNEW the lie affects all our shots, but SEEING specific lies and specific techniques to attack them is incredible stuff.
Rick you’re quite bad for how much time, energy and money you invest into this game. Maybe you should just focus on editing
Loved this video!  Ian was terrific!
Absolute piss take with the ads I'm afraid I had to turn it off after 9 homeless unwatchable for me. 😢
It's great how much time Ian Poulter has taken for you. Wonderful to see how much fun you have together. What a nice person he is. I always liked him a lot. And you can learn so much yourself from this video following him talking through each shot. Just great! Thank you.
But listening to Ian talk is very informative ty 4 these dope videos
Rickard!!! If I know anything about Jack squat I know that self talk doesn't help always go into a shot with optimism, I mean you chalked up a lost shot before you even hit on the 1st putt on 2
Very impressed with Ian he came across really well
when ric shiels hits the tree from trying to do the safe shot ian poulters face was priceless i laughed so much what a gent ian is
Love Ian except for the week of the ryder cups. He seems like a great guy.
this started off shakey and ended up being the best one .. this was fabulous gents fkn awesome
Loved this round with Ian. He was almost there as Rick's caddy primarily and sort of just played his own ball in the meantime lol
Great video
Ian a true gentleman
Ricj's got good-shot-tourettes
What a Gentleman!
What an absolute legend. Being new to golf I loved listening to Ian’s thought process, course management/shot assessment…and a thoroughly nice guy to boot. Great content as always Rick 👍
By far my favorite one yet
Ian was made for YouTube lmao … the looks to the camera like Jim Halpert 😂
Just found this channel. This has got to be one of the best vids I’ve ever seen. Fantastic. Ian Poulter is such a great guy and so informative
RIGHT
1:32:32 The most majestic piece of golf photography I've ever seen. Ian looks like a lion stalking it's dinner
this one is my favorite one to watch, I bet you had a great time plating this one, and the course looks incredible
Rick misses the par at 1:28:00 because he didn’t say “right” before the shot. Pity.
Looked like a fun round except poor Coldcuts got cut out! Did you guys do rock-paper-scissors?
When Ian said he "Reckoned it rained an inch last night." It confused my yankee brain heavily coming from him and his accent. Sounds like something id hear while visiting georgia.
It’s insane that Rick is a scratch but doesn’t play like it 90% of the time
This was good watching as a beginner golfer at 40 😊
Best guest of the series , you seemed to get on well and be on the same wavelength. A lot of fun , I thoroughly enjoyed it👍
That was the best golf video I’ve ever watched, loved it brother👍🏻Keep up the good work
Favourite moment Rick is in the middle of the jungle then goes that’s alright hahaha
Just imagine trying to enjoy a weekend round, and Ian Poulter is playing behind you... I don't think I'd break 100
What a fun match! Neither Rick or Ian played well but it didn't make it any less entertaining. Mr. Poulter is 100% the pro you want to play 18 with, and share a beer with after.
messed up on hole 2 said poulter was even but he mad a bogey, even if i was in respect to you he be even youd be minus 7.
Great to watch this play out my home course. I know each hole so well...but obviously from the yellow blocks not the white tips. Listening to Iain internal chatter is immensely rewarding for game management , the detail for example on hole 17 off the t so insightful 🥳
Just played Woburn for the last three days,  all three courses. This one is my favourite, the Duke's course!!! Just AMAZING course. It was fun watching this challenge for the second time, see where you guys played vs. where I played the shots. Love the chemistry and between you two, really fun to watch .. super entertaining! Kind regards from Iceland ... omar.
43.50 Ian's soul leaves his body
I'm just gonna say it.  Best video on the channel
That was pure enjoyment, and what a breath of fresh air, seeing a top Golf Professional behave in such a friendly  manner.   Ians reaction to that epic 17th fiasco was priceless.
That is the tightest golf course I have ever seen!! Every golf shot would have been terrifying.
When someone says the best part of their game is their “short game” and they are comfortable near the greens and “shot shaping” you know you’re gonna get your ass kicked
Jesus Rick did you really need to put a million ads on the video?? You’re getting enough views to maybe not gouge us mate 🗑️🗑️
This was fun to watch...What a beautiful course. Thanks!
Really enjoyed this one, close match and Ian was great with his analysis and shot thoughts. Top bloke.
The video was good but really how many golf galaxy ads do we need after every shot? That’s my only critique about this.
Ian Poulter...Legend!!! Awesome post!!
What a class act Ian Poulter is. This was a treat to watch.
Ian poulter 🐐
My dad always says jokingly that "no good drive goes unpunished"         After watching this, it seems like its even true for the best players sometimes. lol
I’d of gave you a good game that day Rick 😂
Ian Poulter is now one of my top 5 after this.  He’s just a lad and the pro in him is amazing.
This has been my most enjoyable watch of these matches. The humility that Ian showed throughout is wonderful. A great bit of joking around but, he was so humble in his application in trying to help you out along the way and hearing him talk to himself about his own layups. Really, really good watch this, I think there should be a rematch between you both.  Keep smiling Rick and surround yourself with people like Ian who are willing to give you the time!
That was good.
That stupid add about golf galaxy is so annoying
if i see the same ad one more time i’m gonna throw my phone at a wall
So close Rick, on the 18th!
Damn i can play with Ian now.
You asked which car out of the euros and this... well for 25 to 30k nzd in New Zealand it would be the isf with an aftermarket lsd. Oh and headers. Faster car weight to hp. And way way cheaper. Great vid mate
Ian Poulter is one of my favorites. Very entertaining and fun to watch.
Great video. Very entertaining and wonderful teaching lessons how to approach each shot. I admire Ian P. And all he's brought to the game of golf. Thanks Rick!
Best shot was the dap at the end
One of the best 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Si on met de coté la carte, on a tous des jours sans, la video est très sympa. Mention spéciale à la partie voix off, bien drôle. Thomas, une petite vidéo avec lunette de soleil,  bermuda et chemise hawaïenne à venir? Merci pour tes partages.
Honestly, more drama than any of this year's top films!
SO awesome!
Looked like a grand time! Did you get some Majesticks swag?! that would be fun :)
Looks to be a beautiful golf course
Play min woo lee
This has been one of the most entertaining golf matches I've seen. Both your comments were fun and insightful. Cheers!
Ian is way cooler than I ever thought. Really like this guy now.
Ian Poulter the ultimate entertainer. No matter who he plays he will make it an interesting match
The 14th hole is one of the all timers for great content on the channel
That was fantastic to watch. I’ve only just started playing golf and honestly don’t know many of the pros. Ian was engaging, informative and just a generally nice guy. I’ve been enjoying your videos Rick and have learnt a lot already. Keep up the great work 👍
Awful video
I've totally gained mounds of respect for Ian watching this match. Very entertaining for certain although I think you Rick played horrible :).
Watching from American I hated Ian Poulter at the Ryder Cup (he kicked our ass...lol)  But he is awesome... seems like a great guy to just have a pint with.   One of the best 10 shot challenges.... Brilliant!!!
1:42:56 - I laughed so hard!!!! 😂
Love the build! Use epoxy to seal the rock.  Use your mesh method to seal the concrete to the rock and then apply a few coats of epoxy.  Then you can even feel the texture of the rock.
Beautiful course
What a fabulous video Rick. Ian was brilliant on camera and great golf!
Brilliant
Best yet!
Great video , i love watching these just wish i could play half as good as you Rick
3 guarantees in life. Death taxes and Rick's double bogeying the 1st hole 😂
best golf video ive ever seen
Love your videos Rick... But maybe you should try and move the mix to a different spot. That nose whistle is a bit distracting.
What a gent Ian is, great guy
Think id be putting a chainsaw in my bag
When’s the rematch?
Awesome round that,  Well played Rick.
1hr 43 min in. 😂😂😂😂😂

I quit playing golf out of frustration for like 6 months and unsubscribed cause I couldn't even watch golf channels. I finally went out and played. Highlights were my short game and hitting the flag stick from 160.   Resubbed
What a great video.  Paulter was a  total legend...as always 👌
We going to talk about how you said you'd fade it into the par 5 for your eagle putt but you actually hit a draw lol
The hit off the tree was priceless
Always liked Poulter because of the RC. However now I love him! Thanks Rick. Awesome video.
Great golf  But distracted by ricks ass 😅
Fantastic game, what a gentleman with a great sense of humour
Just great to watch
Definitely my favorite video. Ian has always been a favorite of mine. I giggled like a little kid when Rick hits the tree and Ian faces the camera laughing. Keep up the good work Rick
Nice camera work
Great match
Ian is a top lad. Also, that fit is fire.
Should be a drinking game for how many times “to be honest” has been said
Must be so annoying to play with these guys and not play well, nervous start! Better than that
Unbelievable watch!!!
These Tour PROs can switch it on when the chips are down ... wonderful to watch
what is your handicap rick??🤭
Ian Poulter. The Tom Hanks of Golf.
Soraya  You have changed my attitude to being bold. I have used a sponge sparingly but now my new friend, I am just about finishing an angry Mediterranean purple sky with forked lightening with 7 white Camargue Stallions running along the beach to safety.  This is real IN YOUR FACE STUFF which I can only thank YOU for.  Now a Miami friend wants it for her lounge wall at a nice price.  I will now change the rough water with a sponge And tickle the breaking waves with a brush. God bless 🙏😂 Ross
Great match, Ian is fantastic
Ian is such a sweet person
Was Baldrick from The Black Adder commentating? Great content!
I wish Poulter still played competitive pro golf.
ONE HECK OF A BEAUTIFUL COURSE!!  I’m binge watching your Rick v X videos, love all of them!  Great content!  😊
I’ve found myself watching these rounds with pros back to front because I’m a new subscriber, this is definitely the best of what I’ve seen, Poulter is class,
This has to be the best vlog in terms of a pro being so open on thought process etc and the approachability he shows, absolutely brilliant bloke, cheers both of you for a very entertaining and enjoyable experience!
Ian seems like such an awesome guy to shoot a round with! My favorite Ricky vs your pro video yet!!!
That was fun to watch.
I had been aware of Ian Poulter, now I'm a fan of Ian Poulter!
He is down to earth also he reminds me of Sir Rod always up for a laugh.
72 to 83…..
This makes me love Ian as a golfer and a human. You and him get along so well and he is very friendly and down to earth. You’re a great golfer and person too, but I’m always impressed when people who are at the top of their sport are so willing to give helpful information and have fun doing it.
Probably the most entertaining video I’ve seen yet! Great round!
Less chips more fish.
The worst I have ever seen you play Rick! WTF.. Well done for getting Poulter to play with you tho..
Shame he is LIV
Rick is such a batler but just lives golf so represents how mist of us feel
Is it normal to be gutted when someone near misses a putt on YouTube.
Them trousers are looking abit tight 😂
This is absolutely the best match i have ever seen on Youtube! Cheers Ian and Rick
Second time around watching this.  Fascinating game.  MORE POULTS PLEASE!!!!  What a lovely nice legend!
Two gentemen having a go at it! Excellent content.
Great fun watching you guys play on a 30 below northern Wisconsin afternoon... Waiting for The Sony Open 3rd round to start~
Unbeliveable vidéo ! Thx Rick !!
I’ve watched quite a few of this guys videos and really wonder if he spends anytime working on his game, or is it all about content?
Love this channel Rick has helped me so much with my game. on a side note did i happen to see ball contact on the 9th chip on practice swing 55.41 before the actual shot was taken 😜
Ian’s a great guy, when my brother was 10 or so he gave him some bits at the open and signed his book. Made his day after a bad start of Jim Furyk telling him to F off for asking for a signature lol
Great match on a beautiful golf course. Thank you both!
Is Rick drunk in this one? hahaha
Just re-watched. I would happily bet my house that we all reacted like Ian when you hit the tree on 17 😂😂😂
This whole series is like getting a bunch of playing lessons.  Super interesting to get a peek inside the thought process of these tour pros.  Congrats Rick and the pros on making something so enjoyable as well as being informative and educational.  Great stuff.
I love how Ian Poulter laughs at Rick 1:43, he laughs like a mischievous child.  It's great!
Rick, I understand that capitalism has its place.  Any chance though of signing up for less ads?  I was enjoying the vid, but there are more ads than on a PGA tour event.
I’ll say Rick Ian Poulter seems like a super super nice guy !
Best video ever Rick.  Pouter was the best guest and you could see when he flicked the switch to on but still good natured to the end.
Amazing fun!!! Great birdie at the end for both of you
Keep these 10 stroke match challenges coming Rick! Course was so tight as a bomb and gouge player this place would eat me alive at first.
Best game with a Pro!  Ian’s personality, banter and ongoing commentary was awesome!
My money's on Lee Sharpe to beat you over 18 holes Rick 😂 and definitely get the wife to cut back on the dinner portions!!
This is absolutely incredible. I am new to golf and there isn’t much PGA content of real golfing. Stumbled onto this and absolutely loved every second! Keep up the great work
Absolutely awesome.  Ian was the best.
What a delight to get to listen to what was going on inside Ian's tiny gray cells. Ian's up and down on hole 6 after his first two shots. Holy tomato! I would give my eye teeth to play with Ian. What a great down-to-earth guy! Thanks SO MUCH, Ian and Rick!
I’ll get up and down for par.....chunks it....il chip it in for paaar lol 😂 talks like a lot of us 20 handicappers
This was my fav of the series so far. Ian was awesome
Fantastic vid mate - Poulter is a match play beast.
It has to be said, Shiels is a very average golfer. It’s good watching the pro’s play though.
is it my eyes, or the lens? Rick, u seems to be more "chubby" in this video....
This is such a treat!!! Confirming what I gathered from watching Ian through the years. What a guy!! Thanks Rick, and Ian
Ian is the man! So much respect for him.
One of the best !!!! Chilling in Ohio during the pre winter days I had to lower the heat in the abode again Ian's walk and talk through with his shot selection really opened up my eyes to somewhat the amount of "tools" a golf professional has at their disposal.
I played dukes and duchess courses 35.years ago paid £180 pounds with a carvery on the night.caddy cost £25 what a day
Poulter your a legend and a gentleman
i love Rick but is he a pro golfer? I rarely seem him play well on here and he hits soo many amateur shots...
One of the best videos of you. I just love the conversation possible with Ian and you. Great stuff
This was such a great video. Enjoyed it from start to finish. Mr. Poulter is all class.
We need to see all 18 holes here boys , cheers Si
Has to be said that your reactions are very good 👏🏼 First Radiohead? Creep 12", acoustic version, b side great song, Killer Cars. Bends levelled up. Ok Computer blew my mind. Always compelling since!
Great personality Ian!!!
Cracking video guys. Poults what a guy. ⚡️⛳️
This, in my opinion, is one of the best golf videos on YouTube, Mr Poulter is an absolute legend and the way you see and hear his thought processes is an education
Poulter was a class act. Would love to see him come back
Ok Rick, new rule. Never hit an eagle putt short. If you hit it too far you still have a *chance* and birdie putt.
Rick’s struggles with his tee shot is just unbelievable
That course looks solid. With these 2 having to get serious I’d be happy with a 100.
Unless you are a premium you tube member it’s fare to say you spend at least a quarter of the time watching adverts and in that point there are more adverts than anything exciting not worthy of your time to watch .
this has been a nightmare 4 me first of all I  cast it to my tele .went and poured myself a single malt  settled down to enjoy 35mins of entertainment .spilled my whole glass ,without even having a sip .upset my mojo  some what  .and was never able to get it back because of all the ads,at the wrong times .only the last hole was uninterrupted.(maybe show ads between holes sponsor cos its really putting me off ). but I'm writing this and not watching it Liam chatting on backswing again ,was  typical . its only quiet when liams stroking cos Steve and Pete are more  considerate .Still feeling annoyed.away to watch bullard now to reset myself
Crazy!🎉🎉🎉
Dear Ian, where can I buy that shirt? Thank you.
Who cares !!!
I watched every minute of this video! I grew up with some of the best players in the world. Burke, Demaret, Kite, Crenshaw, Elkington. This was very entertaining. Most of all there are some life lessons for all here. One..Enjoy the game (your game) make it fun! Compliment yourself when you hit a good shot! Don’t be at all hard on yourself when you hit a poor one. You don’t have that right if you don’t practice 4 days a week. Compliment your friends when they do well. Golf is the hardest sport in the world. Lastly, Ian is an ambassador of the sport. You made an old guys day!
That was hugely enjoyable - great fun
IP is an absolute beauty! This had me in tears laughing... some of the worst golf shots I've ever seen and then some of the best. By far the best video you've posted.
British people are so complimentary and polite. Americans could learn a thing or two
The adverts every 2 minutes do my head in
What an amazing day at a simply idyllic looking course.
Unlucky, but I think on the balance of play IAN deserve to win it. The quality of shots he played. was outstanding. ⭐️⭐️⭐️👍👍👍👏👏👏🍺🍺🍺
Do a gen 5p comparison
2 hole tee shot..."Jesus Rick "🤬
What a video! Ian is just a great bloke. His insights and approach to each shot is fantastic to watch. Thanks for a great video Rick👍🏽
Ian “It’s a kiddy friendly show isn’t it??”  Rick “We can bleep.” Ian “BLEEEEP!”
What a really nice bloke Ian Poulter is 👏
Great match with Ian Poulter !  I cannot wait you have a matchplay with Bryson Dechambeau...
Awesome video - cracking content. I'm increasingly liking Poults the more I see of him.
Love to hear Ian share…Shiels, keep working…u can definitely do better
Absolutely amazing to watch best one so far
I must admit I’m hooked on your channel, you keep everything positive and clean so I can watch with my 12 year old son , I can’t stop watching your awesome videos. Keep it up and don’t stop playing golf
Really scenic video, well shot. Did they play any golf?
Thank you for posting this I really didn't like Ian but after I saw the full swing documentary I kind of fell in love with him he seems like a really good person good heart great Family Guy
Ian not only plays well, but I really enjoyed watching his playfulness and these guys were clearly having so much fun. That’s what it’s all about to me. It stops being fun when players take themselves too seriously.
Best one ever!
I've been pondering over this for a while , I do think it's amazing how Ian has given his time for the show and it was a great vlog . But I can't help but feel a little bit sick seeing him in his majestic t-shirt ! once an icon for many golfers and hero for Europe in the ryder Cup. Shame he wanted to tarnish all that for money , when let's be fair did he need to 😢
This has been one of the most entertaining videos on this channel. Ian is boss! The way he laughed when Shiels hit that tree had me rolling! 😅😅😅😂😂😂😂
Ian is absolutely one of my favourites of all time. This was fun to watch. 😂😂
Ian P. #1 2 me
This a great match!  Ian is an absolute gem dude!
I gained a new line of respect for Ian Poulter He has never been a top pick for me but he was a diffrant person in this vid 👍
Rick, this was so enjoyable. I learned so much just listening to both you and Ian.  Thanks for the great content.
What he hit driver on 17 for?
Excellent content and such a fun match to watch!
Host him again. Very entertaining
Really enjoyed this one.  Ian comes across as an "Ice Man" on tour coverage, lots of good banter and commentary.  I, too sometimes play with someone whose"terrible" tends to be shots I would be very happy with.
Best episode yet! You left Ian hanging at the end with the fist bump 😂
Honestly what a guy Ian is man
Thanks for the time you have all given to film and re-edit this most great vid. So great to hear what goes on in a pros head to paint the shot and execute the picture.  I don't think we really appreciate the ball control they have. Rick you continue to create and evolve such great content for us all 👍
Ian's face at 1:12:30 is hilarious
Slow your backswing Rick
14:30 shows the simple genius of a tour pro
Rick….I absolutely loved this video. Ian’s casual joviality and relaxed attitude was incredible. Not great golf by either of you really but I get why. Fun to watch nonetheless
Ian's banter is class all the way..4th time watching
IP reminds me of Rod Stewart 😅
loved this. usually watch for the tips as im new to the game but i laughed  a lot at this lol
Fab film - I'm learning the game, and gave me confidence to see pros and superstars still put a ball against a tree, or in the rough - also learned a lot - cheers👏
what an amazing day you must of had. What a gent Poulter is and what great interaction between you both. Great entertainment all round, thank you for sharing with us.
The best Rick Shiels video😂😂 love it Ian
well no instruction from Rick anymore lol
Rick shot a 89 at River Club-Bradenton; your Complete Golf Swing videos are what any person who wants to enjoy golf needs to watch... Rick's Q School
A lovely course. Much greenery, but not without some pathing.
Great match and wow Ian seems like a great guy to play golf with! Thanks for sharing!
Great contant lol
What a wonderful watch! Nearly 2 hours and kept me intrigued throughout, not often I can say that. Awesome interaction between you and Ian and what a truly humble, funny gentleman he is. Love your enthusiasm to win but also your graciousness in defeat...excellent
1:53:44 why is he biting his club
Love me some Ian P walking with him at the travelers every year in Connecticut
Poults shaking is head :I've got it in the locker" 🤣
Great video, Ian Poulter is just like I imagined he would be. Legend!!
Ian knew you'd over-hood it on 17.  What a mean guy to sucker you!
A really fun video, probably the most enjoyable yet. IP a true legend
Just saw the Crail Guinness Video, shocking  and very disappointing to say the very least Rick. 0 marks out of 10
Too many adverts
Have you tested the sf1 driver yet?
Amazing
this video needs to be taken down, absolute fraud to make money off this considering the Rick Shiels show's view on Poulter and his colleagues
As much as Ian would piss me off during the Ryder Cup, he was an absolute joy to watch in this episode. I loved listening to his thought process, helping Rick, and the banter was priceless.  I would play with Ian in a heartbeat.
“A bit too much draw” Or imo a hook. Mr Poulter does seem a great guy despite all the recent politics/ nonsense
Ian would be a great guy to have in your "golf group".  I enjoyed the match though a "links" type course might have suited Rick better than a tight parkland's style.  But I believe Ian would have done well on that style of course because he got "game"...
Great video Rick wonderful to see  Ryder Cup legend Ian Poulter giving viewers an insight of  how a pro golfer thinks his way round a golf course .while letting us see what a great personality he has
"It's a kiddy-friendly show!" Hysterical.
haha Hooks it ' Aww too much draw.😂 Way too many adverts dude..
Great to see you back big fan of all your stuff sent you many comments on your channel went to see natural swing coach after 1 off your videos congratulations 🎉on your new job at today's golfer buy there mag look forward to your future stuff
Loved how Ian really stepped us as things got closer in the end. Shows you how the right mentality is key and how pros (and us) can up our game just through the way we think.
If I ever meet Ian Poulter I'm gonna ask him one question: "Did Rick Shiels really find that first tee shot?"
Stop using the Lord’s name in vain
No concept of course management!😂
Ian is a legend!
good fun ,thanks
Rick enjoyed watching my favorite pro
You and Phil need to have a go at it at Torrey Pines Rick
“You love being in the trees for some reason.” Me too Ian, me too.
One of the best golf videos ever seen on YouTube! Well played both of you. 🏌‍♂️🔥
Liv golf
Yer Ian top man…👍👍👍👍
Rick needs to learn the correct way to repair a pitch mark and it’s not with a tee pulling up other than that enjoyed it 😅
Rick been a while.  Yet with camera evidence you " still can't accept it, cause there is no believing, its always deceiving. Great display, as for Mr P, superbly entertaining, handy with the sticks as you found out. All those pros are. Namaste 🙏
That was amazing to watch and seeing the great Poults make humble golfing errors to which he recovered like the seasoned tour pro he is was fab, and he had no qualms about picking up his divots and Rick's as well. top man despite moving over to LIV. Well done Rick.🏌‍♂
wow what a vid
Great entertainment. Thanks for being so generous with your time and tips Ian. Would have liked to see Ian take a shot at that hooded 8 iron on 13th around tree. I really enjoy these 10 shot challenges. Look forward to Stenson, hope that happens!
What a beautiful course
Wow! Always been a massive fan of Poulter but so generous with his time and knowledge and I love to see tour pro’s loving their work … fascinating to hear him talk through his shot selection
This course might give me alligator arms
Ballsy putting on Hole 17! What a watch,… thoroughly enjoyed it! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I live and die with Rick. I'm on hole 2 and can feel his nerves
When Rick smoked the tree on 17, I lost it 😂😂😂😂  And the celebration of the tee shot on 18 was class.
Rick, as usual, wonderful stuff! Keep up the great work. You present the best material on Youtube for creatures known as "golfers." And like others before me, I now see Poulter in a much more favorable light.
What a great watch that was 😊 Ian poulter what a. Gent. Essentially caddied  for Rick the whole round 👏😃
Yeah, I give Ian a lot of gruff.  He is a stone cold killer in Ryder though, so respect.
Dude what a great round of golf you played, that was so awesome to watch and it’s even better you have it all on video to remember and look back on! Keep up the great work bro!
Sorry Rick she don’t like ya
Ian Poulter one of my all time favourite golfers mainly for his Ryder cup passion and skill! Great video what a guy
Enjoyed this a lot! Looking forward to watching another one!
That is a tough  golf. course Ian is a great player has been for years.
Most enjoyable golf video I have watched,  highlights that even the best hit the shots that they would rather forget and get the bad breaks that weekend golfers think are solely reserved  for them. Your summary  at the end regarding Ian was spot on, what a memorable day's golf that you experienced personally and both shared with such good humour,  highlighted all that is good in the game of golf.
A really enjoyable watch!
What a great bloke Ian seems.
very entertaining
You should have told Ian... Everybody else's beat u.  What would happen if he didn't? The ridicule from his peers. Then you would have seen the fire in his eyes.
DUDE .. did you practice and warm up? And you teach other people how to play?  Ian is going to out distance you and out skill you but you can't even hit it straight.
That was one of the best YouTube videos I’ve ever watched. How can anyone not like Ian Poulter, the guy is so humble such a genuine person and such a likeable personality. Well played Rick you could see the delight in Ian’s face when you were pulling off some worldy shots. Brilliant content look forward to the next one @rickshiels
The Ian think is really helpful to the average golf. Really simple.
This really cool to the pro at the home course and getting to see there personally is really cool keep it I love this.
Poulter is the coolest...
That was EPIC.  Great insights from Ian.  He is a great player and a good bit of fun. Thoroughly enjoyed this.  Rick, you kept it interesting when many others might have faltered. Well done!
draw it round the tree Rick its the safe shot 🤣🤣🤣
I loved when Ian laughed at rick hitting the tree on the 17th it was like one of your best mates after you fallen over or something 😂
SNATCHED IT AT END EVEN WITH 10 HANDICAPP WOW
Brilliant. Like a lesson with a top pro. What a superb concept and video. Kept them coming.
love this channel just found it i play pga tour 2k21  good game ian is in that game to
Would’ve loved to see Ian pull off that hook 9 iron he talked you into. Great vid. ❤
Hey Chad you took a page out of Tom Sugouto's book. Keeping that trail arm infront of and connected to the body in the backswing. Study Hogan's backswing and you will see very little trail arm elevation. Keep that trail wrist angle and push the palm down and all the way thru impact. Had some nice weather in myrtle this week and shot in the 70's. I am 61 yo. and much smaller than you but that is a respectable distance for a 7 iron. Very nice work Chad.
Poults hits more shanks than anyone ever...when he said shank I was reminded of some of the beauties he has hit on tour where is goes straight right. He is all or nothing and great to watch.
Poulter should do a YouTube channel. I watched him win the Wales Open stood on the edge of 18th Green after walking down the fairway behind him and he was amazing. Then watched him at Ryder Cup and he was a beast.
Awesome that Ian gave this time for this.  Unfortunately it wasn't your best ball striking day.
Thank you, Ian.  I loved it.   It's amazing the level of knowledge Ian used on every shot!
The diff between someone who uses his skills to play the ball and a mechanical player who focuses on the swing while hitting a ball. Rick has no feel, just mechanics.
So many adverts. The reason why I don't watch many of Rick's videos any more.
What a brilliant video.
Well Done Rick and Ian!  Very entertaining!!!  You were off to a slow start on the front Rick, but you picked it up on the back!  Good Job!!!
Great content love IP but add after add after add ruins whole experience afraid
Ian is such a genuine bloke.. His knowledge of shots is phenomenal. I could listen to him all day. I love how he even tried to caddy you as well .. Great video
Ian is great fun to follow!  A great competitor and a class gentleman!
Props for playing with all these pros and making lots of good shots. I’d be absolutely terrified lol
Great series.
Ryder cup legend? Yeah he was, until he decided the LIV blood money was more important ..
I have watched Ian play in many tournaments over the years. He is actually too nice of guy.
Poulter gets such a bad rep but this showed what type of guy he really is. Top bloke
Hugely insightful.  Thank you so much!
always entertaining.  Poulter, what a class act.  well done Rick
*Drinking Game*: Take a shot every time Rick says “right”.
I know he went to LIV but Poulter deserves a captaincy in the Ryder cup. He'd be a great captain for an away one in Bethpage. He's good fun as well and is intelligent.
6th time watching this... 😂
Rick is like the average weekend hack! Lol geez!
Love it
I always loved Poulter, until the LIV fiasco outed him as a complete and utter C word. Seriously, I almost cried watching him hole those putts at the Ryder Cup, but he pissed it all away for blood money. A mammoth fall, a mammoth c**t.
Poulter is incredible, his touch around the green is unreal. And hearing a pro player talk through every shot is amazing
Loved this video, Poults is the absolute best 😊
Gosh ricks swing is awful
Very well done I enjoyed that one.
Never liked Ian Poulter until early morning at the 2012 Ryder Cup where he walked off the fairway right past me into the woods to take care of business. Instant role model.
Loved this. Both of you have great patter and we’re so entertaining to watch. Poults is a legend
And THAT is why I hated seeing Ian Poulter in the Ryder Cup! When he had to make a shot, he ALWAYS seemed get it done. One of the best clutch golfers I have watched.
are you pro or youtuber? lets just be competitive against them at least. grind yourself to be enough to compete with your visitors sometime it just hard to watch
Wow, that was a great video! So much insight into a pros thought process on every shot, I really enjoyed the whole experience. That seemed like a great time, and Ian was a great partner. What a match!
A dream come true...
Brilliant watch not played for 10 years playing sale tomorrow wish me luck 😂😂
57:15 lmao  I need this as a gif
When you hit that wedge shot a little long and you said “well I struck it nice” that’s exactly what I was thinking I would of said 😂 great video mate
The ad’s are to long Goodbye
shiels your a sychophant earning a living without really working
Butter cut pull best yet Rick😂😂😂😂🇮🇪
Poulter is a mega DBAG
First time watching your video what a great guy Ian is telling you about every shot and how it’s going to pay out had my first round on gold Saturday and did a 121 and I’ve got hooked already so played the next day same course and did a 101 was over the moon just need to get over rang and try to get some lesson great video sir
Tbf , ricks wedge into 18 was mega unlucky it was a great shot
Simply superb 👏👏👏👏👏
Ian Poulter. One of the all time greatest golf personalities of any era! Great entertainment! Great match!
1:42:58 ... Hahahahahaha!!!!! I just rewatched this about 100 times. Sooooo funny!
That was brilliant.. to hear Ian talk us through his thought process was amazing.
Too much draw - I think that is a hook😂
You missed off young frank Kennedy ⛳️👍
Ian is a frkn beast...always fun to watch...head to head can beat anybody
Incredible guest. You guys created an episode with the same vibes as SoccerAM in its heyday.
The best yet just love Poult's he saved his best till last BRILLIANT thanks guys loved it.
Very cool Video, you two are awesome❤. Fun to Watch
2:08
Sitting here with Covid, this was an outstanding watch. Poults is such a gentleman and a character. Rick you were soooo close. Regardless an entirely excellent watch. Better than most tournament rounds I have watched.
That was awesome. I laughed my ass off when Ian lost it after Ricks 2nd shit on 17 off the tree.
1:42:10 Ian standing in the woods: "drive a bus through there" .. :)))
Amazing video!
Poulter was quality throughout, would be great for a review of your missed shots for a review of what you did wrong
Tough course narrow, tree lined, lots of places you don’t want to be in. Good play guys.
Best proper tour pro guest ever. Down to earth, modest, generous. Would love to see you, Guy, James Robbo Robinson & Ian play together. Greensomes??? 😅
Ian poulter is a god  Sooo many Ryder cup memories I’ve loved  No one will ever match his heart ❤️
55 year old American here that absolutely hated Ian from his Ryder Cup days, but I gotta tell ya this video totally changed my perspective of Mr. Poulter.  Greta video, love Ian’s play by play and his humility, class act!
When they putt, why do they mark the spot, pick up the ball, look around, put the ball back and take their shot???  i understand marking and picking up the ball for the other persons shot, but that was not the case a few times...
This looks to be a terrifyingly narrow course!!!  Damn!!!!!
Top man Poults
Rick really enjoyed this what a great guy Ian is! Looked like you had great fun.
feck youtube and their adds
class
Ian is so sympathetic.....Love him!
mike simpson
best one yet Ian is such a nice guy and looks like a great dad
Great video, and insight into the mindset of a pro golfer, so open and honest.  Love how Ian never seems to claim to be unlucky.  When shots don't come out perfect he always owns them, "landed it too short" on hole 5, when he is fortunate the next hole he's equally quick to say it.  It is so easy to believe you're unlucky all the time, when you are the only one in control.  You generally make your own luck, a reminder for me that once you own that in golf, instead of blaming the golfing gods, your game can only improve!
Looked like a great day. Ian is a star.
Give me a break, Poulter was never a great player, just a Ayer who made a lot of money. Look at his recorded history of wins, look at his performance in LIV and I recon your grandmother could play better.
Awesome guys!
Ian is clearly an amazing father his son is pure class 😂
Been ians gan since he came out of bishop stortford. Many moons again. Well played rick ))
I'm very new to golf, only did driving range twice so far but I'm hooked. I don't know most of what they were saying but even a person with no knowledge of golf can be entertained by these two. Great banter, loving this ⛳⛳⛳
I shot over 90 today, which is bad for me. You guys made me feel a little better....
I’ve watched a lot of YouTube golf vids - this was hands down one of the most entertaining. Truly enjoyed this one.
GREAT video. Wow! I thoroughly enjoyed that.
Wish ian would have hit shields shot on 13 so we could see how he would have played it
love this way of watching golf! You learn so much!  please keep them coming. thank you so much
This was like watching two friends out golfing and having fun,.  Congratulating good shots and laughing at mistakes .    This was great.
What a great match,    I am glad I watched,  I enjoyed the personality from Ian.   Very different  impression than watching him on TV.   He is hilarious,   Thank you for a Great video..   I hope that he is on your channel again,
Unlucky for Rick on that last hole. Every shot he hit was good but Poulter found his groove on the last few holes. He came across really likable too. Still competitive but fun, funny and magnanimous.
What a finish .  Ean deserved the win .  Please tell the groundskeepers to plant a few more trees LOL .
I love that Mr. Poulter seems really genuine about helping Rick with yardage and shot selection.
What a vibe, hats off to both of you! Great sportsmanship from Ian!
I don't watch golf I know very little about golf...and quite frankly not even sure how I ended up on this video LOL and all that being said it was still very fun I imagine a golf fan would really really enjoy em
absolute awesomeness!
These videos are class. But somethings got to give. Tou not reckon these pros are thinking.. what am i doing here. Playing with a 15 handicap players 😂
Ian makes for a great bloody caddie tho
What a Video, love to watch 17th and 18th, what an Entertainment.
That was absolutely epic ! Well done
Took me a week to watch the whole thing, but damn glad I did! Wouldn't have thought I would enjoy watching 2 dudes play a round so much. Ian's personality is just great. Loved the behind the scenes sort of view that we never get on a pros round of golf. Great job both of you!
I had not seen any interviews with Ian Poulter, so other than likely recognizing him, I had no idea of his game or personality.  After watching this video, I can happily say that it was time well spent.  What a gentleman.
What an absolute gentleman. Ian is all class. Great round guys. 👌🍺🏌️‍♂️
I used to really like Rich and I suppose I still do to a point but I wish he wouldn’t constantly keep sucking the pros off,
These make me very uncomfortable to watch
GO MAJESTICKS BABY
Nick, think you might need to see Pete Cowen 😁
The thought process that a pro puts into a shot is mental. One of the best pro’s to have played the 10 under so far 😊
I think Rick should have a 15-20 shot advantage to start
That was up there with the Nick Faldo vid! Thanks for the entertainment.
The question is how embarrassed and awkward do u feel rick as I swear u bought your pro licence as your golf is ridiculous
I didn't know Ian was that funny. Oh I see. Because there was no money involved.
I just came here to say probably not
Just started golf and I can’t get enough of it I’m in love with it and looking forward to getting my swing better and I love these videos and channel ❤
some of the most intense and entertaining golf i have ever watched!
Y’all putting mid
Love how I could be beating Rick after 2 fo sho
Absolutely golden. No change in his openess and generosity of spirit at any point, despite the difficulty of his position in the match and the fact he had nothing to gain and everything to lose. Easy to see how you'd want to have him on your team.
A great watch. And I think ive fallen back in love with Poults
Best one yet 👊👊👊
This is one of my favourite videos this year, Ian is amazing and Rick's choice of driver on all holes was comedy gold😂
That was great fun. Thanks guys
Great episode, Ian Poulter is an awesome guy, can't imagine someone much more fun to play with
Joining that other golf mob  doesn’t mean he isn’t the perfect Ryder cup captain so I hope when they combine he is next captain.unfairly judged,doesn’t mean he’s lost the passion to beat the yanks.
was really really enjoying it but had to turn off as adds of 30 sec + every 5 minutes ruined it
great format once again thanks
Ian is absolutely made for this! Funny, a great golfer, personable and brilliant at talking through his shots. Ive watched a hell of a lot of golf videos but this is the best of all of them
A lot of fun to watch! Really enjoyed the conversation, and the multitude of shots! The way both players amped it up at the end! Wow! You could tell Ian was really enjoying the match coming down the final hole. Really good stuff!
wow what a great video - loved the chat and great chat - thanks
Ian in a friendly game plays differently in competition when he becomes deadly accurate and can putt with the Best of them, considering you did well playing with someone as Good as Ian
The 5 iron on the Par, you hit over into the trees, that bounced out into the middle of the fairway.  We have a friend that does that all the time, I mean ALL the time.  That shot is known as a “Wilbanks”.
Great video
Damn in an American accent 😂😂
Ian poulter what can you say. Great character, superb player, kind and genuine. Great video
That Dumb and Dumber quote lmaooo! Love Ian so much
Is it just me or does Poulter seems like a fast of pace golfer
Of all your pro golfer guests, I absolutely loved how Ian handled this round of golf. He was your caddy, he took us through basically every shot and was just an absolutely amazing golfer. Well done Ian...loved it!
Just my opinion: Why didnt you ask any questions about Ians golfcareer, his life, or the liv tour or anything similar? I can come up with thousands of questions but you only talked about your own game for 2 hours? You should combine the video as also an interview and not just a chance to improve your own game. Dissapointing.
This dude is chill af🔥 i dont really golf but these videos are so much fun
Rick, best 10 shot challenge yet! I have great respect for Ian, his thought process, and the advise he gave you along the way. I learn so much on the approach of how to score! Great content and keep up the great work!
Took me 4 sessions all weekend to finish but such a good video! Up the Poults🚀
What an amazingly entertaining round. Wow, so many fun and funny moments. Ian was an all-star. Thanks guys!
Ian’s looks at the camera while Rick is talking to himself are genuinely hilarious. What a treat of a human being! Hope he knows how much we enjoy him in content!
I’m going to use a British accent on the course from now on. Calmer just listening to the lovely chaps
Hardlines Rick well played🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Sorry rick😅😅😅😅😅
What was the temperature? Ian looks dressed like 25 C, you rather like 10 C. Thanks
what a country club!
Ian is suck a cool dude!! I’d love to hang out with him
I have figured out one thing! Rick will never be scratch! I can tell by the way he thinks on course. Best of luck Rick
Ian seems like a genuinely great guy. Love to have round with him. Well done guys!
Rick looks a bit nervous on hole 2 lol I would be too
Just a pleasure to watch, Than
Poulter is a total bro
My favourite video, Ian is a absolute legend. To hear a players thoughts as there planning shots is something to hear. Difference is they execute it 😂
I can see why Ian doesn’t play on a real tour anymore. Most decent tour pros would rip Woburn to shreds but he can’t even break par 😂
Wicked....loved it. What a top bloke.
Ian Poulter and yourself were just a delight to watch around a course I love to play. Great to see it played by you two. Am already looking forward to my next trip to Woburn. Watching a pro like Ian play with all the thought processes is just an education all us amateur golfers will benefit from. Plus the quality of play from you both at your best is just great to see and the recovery shots when you’re in trouble so good. The course is my favourite of the 3 courses at Woburn and probably the one I favour if you are slightly off line though still punishes you for wayward shots. Tricky when you are offline and really tests you to manufacture shots.   I was fortunate enough last year for Ian to sign his autobiography signed and managed to thank him on this year’s trip to Woburn. A great player and a wonderful venue - all 3 courses are fabulous. 👌🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♀️⛳️   Looking forward to your next challenge. 👏🏼👏🏼
Great Show! Lots of fun!
Fantastic guest. One of the best episodes if not the best
Okay i think red chooses the next course.
Loved it from start to finish. What a way to end!
Rick is an atrocious golfer. Shank central
Let me also say, Ian manned the flag and also replaced divots, ALL day… What a class act, true gentleman!!!
I have always really liked Ian, I absolutely love the the man after watching this round… Rick, I so appreciate the content that you bring to us, you are the man!
Rick’s ‘fade’ is a 3 yard draw.
Ian laughing at 1:43:00 is absolutely hilarious!
That's the church we got married in. Woburn is beautiful place.
Congratulations Ron finally. We are going to be partying harder this weekend than when Cam Smith won the open.
You really have something here Rick. Watched a few of these now, and this round against Ian was top notch content for so many reasons. Thanks to Ian for his insight. What a great personality 👌
Poulter is the coolest tour pro ever!
Editor needs to boost the master audio levels as it’s way too quiet then the ads come in and blow your eardrums out.
Ian poulter is absolute class🤌🏻 loved this video
I got a smile on my face the entire round! So fun to watch, thanks Rick, and thanks Ian!
Such a fun video to watch! Ian Poulter seemed to be having a great time and the match got tight at the end, like it often does. Entertaining to the end! Keep up the great content. 🙂
Epic challenge. And the Postman delivered.
Fantastic video!
I just found this series and it's a shame you spoiled the previous results in this video. :/
Cool Ians kids just chillin there vibing w them
Ian is damn cool. What a gentleman!
How absolutely  interstellar boring
My respect for Ian Poulter just sky rocketed
Really helpful to see the pros (and tour pros) getting into scrapes and hear the thought process.
Could you say which clubs you use for each shot for next videos
The level of class a pro golfer is compared to even a very good golfer like you Rick is absolutely insane… these guys are just incredible they are so much better than the average person it’s really insane
Well played both, who is the next victim Rick? I am really enjoying this series
Ian Poulter,  absolute legend and so down to earth. Awesome
beautiful course
not often you get me  watching a  2 hour video  but sooo glad i did. brilliant. poults  was  superb on camera and def  brought the best  out of you Rick. well played and  great video
Loved hearing the commentary,  and inspired to play  better  tks
This was such an awesome video. Left a like and will subscribe
Ian shaking his head made me really enjoy this match!
rick suckkkkks
I've never commented on your videos before, but I have to say, that was brilliant! Very enjoyable watch. Poulters ongoing commentary was so insightful to a tour pro's mindset.
alternate title: Can I lose to Ian Poulter by less than 10 strokes?
great match
Ian has a great sense of humor. He just needs to quit playing great when playing in the Ryder cup!
What I most admire about pro golfers is their commitment to maintaining the courses, Poulter with handfuls of turf, repairing the fairways... he's a multimillionaire.... incredible imo, what a bloke
Loved this one!  Really shows Ian's character.  Many laughs and smiles through this one.
This makes me love Ian as a golfer and a human. You and him get along so well and he is very friendly and down to earth. You’re a great golfer and person too, but I’m always impressed when people who are at the top of their sport are so willing to give helpful information and have fun doing it.
Commenting again to say that was awesome
That first hole looked tight
Alright Rick, here it is:  You and Ian vs Westwood and (insert other youtuber of your choice) match play.  That would be absolute fire.  Make it happen'
Brilliant to watch, thanks guys 🙏
Ian is a wonderful player and has an equally pleasant and delightful personality. I am a new fan of his from America. I wish him the best. Rick is a great golfer, but I think that he is even better at finding high quality professionals with which to play a round. Excellent video!
Made the mistake of starting to watch this video at about 11:30pm, it's now 1:30am and I'm up at 6! Will regret that when the alarm clock goes off but it was a great watch. Enjoyed Ian's talk-through of his shots, the difference between his and my thought process is laughable - great insight!
All square on the last... you cant make that up. Just Gold Rick
Rick, play scratch but get two shots twice a hole.  :)
What a finish. Quality golf and great vibes from both golfers
Thias was amazing! Great job!
So good
Might be the best yet. Just seemed like two old mates shooting the shit hitting balls….great chemistry. Rematch please.
How Rick says “damn” makes me laugh every time. More like Deemnn 😂 sounds so funny for some reason
Revisiting this one, such a pleasure doing you both company around this beautiful course. Your conversation and pre-shot analysis from Ian is top tier 🙏
So so so interesting - to actually follow the thoughts of a pro before every single shot of all 18 holes. Thanks for this insight - amazing video 😀👍
Your golfing is awful as mine, but Ian Poulter is such a nice character! Jokes apart I love your videos! Greetings from Santiago, Chile
Great video Rick! A match against Robert Rock would be a great one!
I'd definitely watch that again!
That was hard to watch. Felt your pain. Ugh
Ian seems like a really cool guy!
Poulter is a Legend wow
Always been a huge fan of Ian, and this video shows exactly why. Just a great person. Love his posts on his Facebook reels also.  And his cars are epic.  Probably my favorite video of any so far. And I’ve been watching for years.
It’s mad because I think Ian is more of a numbers man than I would ever of expected, fascinating to hear him talking about distance when choosing his club for each shot to the green, great stuff!
Rick, mate, you got to lose some weight. You, Robinson and Finchie should have a match! I love your channel, content, guests so don't think ill of me.
Best video he has ever made, needs to happen again with Ian Poulter for sure
Legendary video!
Amazing video.  Love Poulter.   That course looked so good.  Did he let you drive one of his Ferraris?
When Mr Poulter tells you to, “Like Subscribe, and just deal with it…” you do just that! You are absolute class Rick 56:12 ! You will get that W soon man!!! We all rooting for you!!!
Curious how id hit that wedge
Your best yet ..thank you
Get a rematch with Ian.........11 shot challenge.  Lol.
(Stroke play) sounds super kinky
Rick poults is my favourite golfer of all time so I'm glad you didn't win but blimey what a great effort
Love Poults and great listening to each shot process. Great guest Rick.👊
Ian poulter is amazing
Why not show the end ffs
1:20:57 My favorite golf shot and golf moment of the last decade.
Great guest
that was really enjoyable to watch rick and poults lol....looks a tough course. well done.
What an absolute gentleman and fantastic golf player Ian is. Tremendous video, Rick
Ramp up that crown Poulter,  get em clapping.......then shank it into the woods😆 sorry man, couldn't resist!
Poulter is an absolute joy to watch. Seems like the most genuine bloke!
1:21:05 the way Ian genuinely belly laughs is so good 😂
Hole 2.. it's says poults is E... but he was 1 under..
The LIV stuff had made me a little cool on the likes of Poulter but this video reminds me of the fact that he's a such a regular, likeable guy. Thanks for that Rick, really enjoyable content that shows why golf is such a great, sociable, respectful game.
Cracking watch! Thoroughly enjoyed it and loved how you both looked you did too! Poults, Ryder Cup legend and bloody nice chap!!
Hahah “welcome to the PAR-TEE” very punny 😂
Trying playing the course instead of the player it might help you with a lower score .You seem to be worried about who the opponent is place that in the back of your mind and just play the surroundings .I understand these are pros at the top of their game but still human you have it in your locker to win
Great match!
Mate! Ive just gotten into golf and getting lessons. Ive watched every minute of this so far. Usually golf videos are boring but this 2 hour long video has felt like 20 minutes! Love your content mate :)
Loved this one 😂😂 poulter was brilliant!  I remember driving poulter to get pizza whilst his jet was being fixed at RAF leuchars it’s one of my claims to fame
really epic video...seems to be a very nice relationship between them...awesome...thanks to both of you!
I could watch your chaps all day long
Bravo my man. Great content.
The most entertaining (and only!) 2 hr golf video I’ve ever seen. Great work guys 👏👏👏
He seems like such a nice dude. Love hearing his on-course thoughts.
Brilliant vid , been a big fan of Ian's for years , great game , Thanks
Absolutely brilliant!!!  Thank you Ian, i learned a ton.  ✌out
Entertaining round!
As a American I always thought Ian was a ass hole this video changed my mind pretty cool cat
Damn I think I watched multiple times ! Fav video by far, love the openness, advice and laughter from Ian.   Kudos 💪🔥
It is so much fun watching you play with pros because they are so much fun like there really good friends of yours.
Love everything here: great course, great guys, great conversations and insights. A big thank you for this one🤗
Only one bunker shot in the whole game is pretty dam good u2.
I think Rick needs a -20 stroke differantel
Fuck me rick got his fair share of ads in this
It’s amazing how bad Rick is at golf 😂
One fun round to watch and hear all the strategies
This is an absolutely awesome video, epic content! Ian what a proper guy getting an insight to how legends play the game. Awesome both of use 👏
Great match!  It's great hearing a tourny pro talk us through his shots!  Almost, Rick, almost!
Poulter is a legeng big Ryder cup player putts anything from any distance when we needed it most.
Thanks for this Rick, as golfer just getting to break 100, it great to see Pros in the trees etc and working out how to get out, more entertaining and more informative to watch. Looking forward to you finally beating a tour pro, cant belive you took two in the bunker at the end of playing with Rickie Fowler!! better luck next time.
What an awesome video.  Love these cany wait for the next one.
Gah, how cool is Ian!!
What range finder is Ian using ?
Awesome video Ian is a beauty. Next challenge= John Daly!!!!
At the 18th hall, I think Ian said Korean 'go-mab-sup-ni-da' that means 'thank you'. Is it right??? I'm so surprised :)
That was awesome to watch!
Always been an Ian Poulter fan and nothing changed with that video.
I love you videos man great stuff every time! I just hate it when you curse our lord Jesus name.
Surely they're not all this entertaining. Got can't help but give your left arm to play a round with these guys. Oh. Make that my right arm.
I have become a fan of Ian and Ricky from watching your videos. They seem to be really nice individuals. Thanks for doing these challenges videos
Everyone knows Ian's character, but he was absolutely fantastic - talking thru his thoughts and approach to each shot - you rarely get those sorts of insights into the mind of a top golfer 👌
I don't know why Rick tries to hit draw shots all the time.  Just hit it straight so your mistakes are pushes or pulls not draws, hooks, fades or slices... pushes and pulls is what he should be having when he makes a mistake.  16:16 Dude he's hooking wedges FFS... time for a new swing dude.  Don't worry about shot shaping.
I‘m afraid Woburn GC would not fit my game well!😅 Fairs looked so tight, so I wonder why Rick has chosen the driver so often, while not hitting it solidly that day… 🫣Anyway, it was fun watching it! Thanks for the entertaining video, thanks to Poults for joining! Always fun to see how great tour players read and play the golf courses!🏌🏻‍♂️👍🏻
Awesome
Good watch that good personalities
Great effort Rick...really enjoyed that..Poults is such a regular dude...top video 👍
Another fantastic video Rick!! The LGBTQ community is really lucky to have you.
Rick……… coming for you.  Wait, I think I can take you now.  One year ago I was looking up to ya, different times now!
Loved it. Ian was entertaining. Funny round like golf usually is. Would like to see more with him.
What an amazing course!
Fantastic viewing Rick and Ian is such  good sport. More importantly for me, he’s got a great sense of humour 👍🏻🇦🇺
Very fun match to watch. Really appreciated Ian's gamesmanship, hospitality, and entertainment factor. Great show
Poulters drive  on the second hole is how I normally end up.
Great video Rick
One of your very best videos Rick. I am a loyal follower of what you do on your site. This one is really enjoyable....
Poults is such a nice guy! LIV or not, he is too cool.
I already liked Ian Poulter but now I Love him!  As fans seeing pros talk us through the shots is always something we love to see (which is why Rick always asks the pros to talk us through it (thanks Rick always been a fan))  But what Ian adds is his geniue caddying at a high level and Rick doesn't have to ask.   I remember when Nick Faldo gave rick that wonderful piece of advice with the low 9 iron shot into the heavy wind but Rick basically had to beg for that and it felt like Nick reluctantly gave it because he is so competitive and I dont hate Nick for it . . . Thats his personality even against Rick he was there to win thats the way he is thats the mindset that won him Majors.   And no Ian doesnt have a major but his ryder cup career alone and his reactions in that tournament show how competitive he is and how good he is in these one on one scenarios  And we saw that competitive drive really kick him into gear at the death when Rick was somehow holding on (I mean that in the nicest way possible Rick but at one point I thought Ian was gonna need an 8 on the last to get it done)   But dispite it going to the wire Ian still helps Rick (without asking) as a caddy genuinely to the best of his abilities.   He also warned Rick about the 20ft spin at the end I felt like Rick didnt buy it because of how Ians landed.   Either way we saw Ian change gears to close it out.   Rick not your best round but I really applaud the way you played that last hole when the pressure was max and the confidence understandably knocked.   And Ian . . . Thanks for adding so much to a series that already on its own delivers so much . . . You have set a benchmark for the pros that follow.   Wish I could give this more than one like.   Thanks Lads!
The back and forth banter is sometimes more enjoyable than playing golf itself. Ian was a great sport for taking the time out to play with Rick.
So much respect for Ian Poulter. What a charming and warm man. Thanks to both Rick and Ian for sharing their round with us.
Fantastic! Ian is one of my favorite players. He should have a channel and do more posts like this! What a character!
That was awesome...such a good time. What a great guy Ian is.
This might be my favorite 10 stroke video.  Ian seems like a real person, not an arrogant athlete
I love the content.  Such a good calab.  I have been watching both channels for a long time.  I love thrifting clubs.  Rick, you are the best!!!
Yes ditto the comments already, Poults is your Saturday golf buddy, great banter I’ll have to get back to Woburn it’s a phenomenal place.
Wow, first time watching one of your 10-shot challenges and it was great. Well done. And great camera work.
I love the way the pros talk. Ian chips it short: "Ah it's come out too good." Ian slices it: "Ah I've over-cut it."
Great video. Hearing the thought process of IP was priceless. Have a plan for every shot is what I learned. Also, it looks like Rick is loving the sausage rolls, 😄. Love it. Skinny is boring anyway, live it up RS!!
Rick is a thick boy 🧐 stores it all in the middle. Great vid 🫸🫷
Man that was fun to watch and he seems to be such a good guy! Loved it!
Ian needs to put his arms around the tree
Loved every minute. Ian Poulter, Absolute Legend !
This is my second time watching this whole video because the banter from Ian is so good.
Best bit of YouTube ever. Saw every minute of it. Poults was amazing and so gracious with his time. He doesn’t need any celebrity but just shows what a true gentleman and champion golfer he is. LEGEND!! Shiels was entertaining as ever. Keep on golfin in the free world❤❤
Rick sucked this one up
These are just warm up shots. Dam we all been there😂
Fantastic video and Ian P is a superb watch.
Great to watch your videos, looking forward to see you play Stenson ⛳️😃
And that is why Poults is such a favourite to many. Open, honest, funny and a great golfer. An easy 1 hr 55 mins watch. 👍
Without doubt the most entertaining and informative video I think I have ever watched. Not only was it fun but to have that insight into the mindset of one of the games greats and the shot thinking he goes through, you just never get to see that - awesome video thank you.
"What are you thinking Ian?" "Well I'm holding a three wood so I'm not thinking" Brilliant
Echoing so many other comments, I have always admired Ian Poulter but watching him play, share his thoughts, show his sense of humor, and his ease of playing took my respect for him over the top. Class act all the way. Thanks, Rick.
Really like Poulter. Its incredible what goes through the mind of a world class golfer. Its mathematics and unbelievable skill.
Ian is giving Jim Halpert vibes the way he looks at camera
Amazing video, incredible golf course and top professional 🎉🎉🎉
Can I call you Poults yet? 😂
Ian started in the pro shop and worked his way up.. Always liked him, his personality and his passion ! A true journey man respect fella!
33:28 Bromance showing
Nice match... you guys have great chemistry!
Thank you Rick.  That was absolutely awesome allowing us to get an insight into the great golfing mind of Ian Poulter.  One less double Bogey and you could have beaten Ian at home!  Ian Poulter is a huge gofling hero of mine and thoroughly enjoyed it!
These videos are your best work. Very entertaining. Poulter was really enjoyable. Thanks!
We love you like a brother from a different mother!! So proud of you Bryson. Please stay safe and keep up the great work!!!
Im coming around on ian hes the prick friend who keeps you on your toes
11over 😂😂
what a legend Ian is, class vid as usual rick
This is one of the best videos. So fun to listen to Ian and Rick.
epic match. poults is a legend 😊
My favourite video so far, more please Rick
Did Ian make a dumb and dumber reference at 1:24:27 ?
If Ian grew up playing that j̶u̶n̶g̶l̶e̶ that "golf course", no wonder he beats every other player in the tour. Great video! It was like being there.
I tried this and it works. I’ve tried about everything to hit a draw without success now I setup for a draw, put my club head back and boom hitting a nice draw and this works for hitting a high baby fade also
Fantastic video really enjoyed it
Love Ian!
In the history of comebacks, and I suppose speaking,  has there been a greater response to a question!  Rick: Why were you asking for your ball to 'go' on your drive?  Ian: Because I wanted it to get closer to the green!
Montgomerie, Fowler, Poulter and other pros, this videos are just priceless honestly. These 3 pros are just amazing on camera, and such amazing human beings. You can just feel how much Ian actually looooves this, and how he at 11-12th hole starts to be even more competitive.   These challenge Pro videos, and the GoodGood collaboration videos are truly the absolute best on YouTube.  I wish you could do these videos every single day, because they are just absolutely perfection. ❤❤❤
What clubs are you playing?
I think if I could play one round with a tour pro, I would pick Ian.
What a great video. This was fun to watch all the way through. Awesome all the way around, Rick!
Not a golfer but thoroughly enjoyed this video , what a guy Ian Poulter is , top class
Top video 👍
Nice game. 🍻
Super video! Ian is such a nice person and a great golfer! I hope to see him again soon on the channel
The great Ian Poulter appreciated the work you put in Rick and so do we. Top insight from one Golf’s all time great competitors, thanks for a brilliant video.
I played the Dukes recently in a mixed ability 4 ball. So played Texas scramble against the course off scratch. This brought back so many wonderful memories. If you had  the chance to play just one round with one tour player, Ian on the Dukes would have to be right up there. Thanks again for the fabulous entertainment guys, wonderful stuff!
What a fantastic and genuine guy Ian is fantastic video
Stellar video Rick, have not watched you for a while but this was top drawer. Ian Poulter is such a kind gentleman with his comments and what an entertainer. Woburn looked tough, as even top class golfers can hit trees square on 😂😂😂
Watched the adverts and now and again some golf came on . Great content but far too many ad breaks
Excellent. Ian was incredibly entertaining .
If there’s one person on this planet I could play golf with it would be this guy. I’ve always been a fan of Poulter.
Awesome, so much fun to watch…well done!! 🙌🏼
Great  video Rick !!!
Did the Saudis throw a few blood dollars your way to play with Poulter 😂
What a brilliant and interesting guy Ian is, such a great insight. Ian would make a cracking Ryder Cup captain
Great video Loved it when Ian flipped the switch and went into pro mode, going quiet on the greens leaving Rick to read his own lines.
Hands down, one of my favorite videos you've ever made. Great content!!!
Ian - “Soft, open-faced chipped 3-wood slice” …cracked me up 😆
i love the fact that he talks to you rather than down to you. Seems really supportive even when offering critic
Great video. One of the best. IJP such a great character 😊
Terrific Rick
This was your clip I liked the most! Ian Poulter is now one of my favorite ever! Great golfer, great person at all. Really god job rick!
Tough course. Like they chopped down just enough forest for the fairways. Good show.
Before watching this video if you had asked me which current touring pro I'd like to play with, Ian would have made my short list (always been a fan). Now, he's moved to the top of that list. Great video.
These are always dope love the vid
rick you need to change the driver
Loved it...... great bloke! 😃
Had to subscribe
Very funny, the one shot slice fix ad popped up, then when video resumed... Bang on time for rick to send it right into the trees...
Ian Poulter is a legend! Rick seems to have gotten considerably worse at golf over the last few years, not that it matters for the playing partner content. Just noticed he used to be a lot more consistent that he is now
I have admired Ian for a long time. Having to watch from afar I have always thought if I was in a fight I would want him by my side. Yet this video showed  another side that you would normally not get to see. I now admire him even more. Thanks Rick for a great video.
15th is 4 to play not 3.
Thanks for a fantastic video. Ian is just as likable as I thought he was but never really got a chance to see. And he's right, Stenson would be a great opponent, but expect a lot of banter :)
What a fantastic video. Ian is my all time favourite pro and how he coached Rick around the course just shows that although he wanted to win, Ian was willing to give his time to ensure Rick had a good round too. Top top man, thanks for the video
So good.
Truly amazing video! Great work. Great guys
Really enjoyed it Rick. Love to see Ian on again 👍
Poulter must be everyone golf fans dream play partner
brilliant Rick enjoyed the round,what a lovely man Ian is great fun thanks.Kieron
The video with Nick Faldo was great https://youtu.be/Zfig_x7EoQ4 but this was much better. What a guy !!!
That's up there with the best golf content about. Take a bow. 🎉
In the display on the top right before every hole and shot you should display what club the player (or you) are using! Would be nice to know what distance you or them are going for and what club they will used. Ofc some more editing work but would really be interesting!
You've put out some great videos over the years, but this may be the most entertaining one yet! Thanks to both Rick and Ian!
Watched this very shortly after watching Poulter's episode on Full Swing....seems like a top bloke!
So painful - Why that idiot move on 13. Love your content bud! That was stupid though!!!
1:42:05 Ian wetting himself at Ricks shot......................brilliant  😂😂
Best one yet.  Ian was a great guest.
When you hit that tree and Ian just started giggling, it made me feel like every golf day I've ever had at my local tree filled course. happens exactly like that every time
What a cool guy Ian is. Never would have known until now.   Also Rick.. you are all of us that play golf on the weekends. Mad respect!!
Rick you give me hope.
Think you should play me now Rick give me 10 strokes to see if I can beat you 😂
I would love to play a round with shields and poulter. Legends both of them.
I really enjoyed that.  What a nice guy Ian is.  I am surprised that he didn't shoot lower being that he plays that course all the time.
A few take-aways: 1) Aim small, miss small even counts on drives. I’m happy to hit a fairway, let alone actually intending it to finish somewhere more specific on said fairway; 2) I only dream of a day when I could hit my irons as far as I now hit a driver off the tee; 3) I wonder if I don’t think thru my options more before hitting recovery shots. Do I aim for a gap and try to draw it a little (good luck with that) or do I safely chip out onto the fairway for a clear shot instead? I usually opt for the safe out; 4) I admire how top-tier golfers even hit bad shots but refrain from crumbling under a bad attitude and then hit fantastic follow-up shots, instead of (like me) hitting a bad shot that gets in my head, leading me to a horrible follow-up shot, etc.  Great video on several levels…not just for its entertainment value!  Thank you!
Ian didn't sweat at all... and he knows it.
brilliant match
A great video, Poults (can I call you Poults now) was awesome..and Rick wasn't half bad 🙂
I have watched Ian crush my Ryder Cup dreams more than a few times.  I went from hating him on principal, to thinking what a great dude he is.  Such a character, much love from South Carolina!!!!
that was mega .Well done keep the videos coming .
Great video but why does Rick say he's a 3 handicapper when he's clearly on average about a 9?
What a character, a genuine nice guy, probably the best golf video i've ever watched and i've watched a few. Highly recommended
Best match yet! Loved every second!
I have a theory that Rick is actually a +15 HCP and just decides to shoot bad scores sometimes in order to keep the content this exciting. Amazing video, fellas.
Loved it.
brilliant vid-really gave us insight into tour level matchplay-thank you both!!!!!!!!!!
My heart dropped when that ball rolled back right past the hole there on the 18th that was so close such a great shot  great video
Ian Poulter’s laugh at your game 🌲🏌️‍♂️says all there is to say about your game! FIX YOUR GAME! Slow your mouth 👄 For the love of God, please 🙏🏻
Great video. What a fantastic bloke IP is. Fantastic
So class. Rick next time you can get Ian on i think we'd enjoy a match play event
Rick this just shows you are human and not a PGA robot pro that never feels pressure....lol
Absolutely great video, Ian is a fantastic bloke
Best ever video on the rick shiels channel!!
Not a chance
Great video and Poults has always been the man..Not sure how you do it but it’s great how they have the time to make these videos with you ??
Ian seems like a pretty good dude, always assumed hed be the arrogant dick type, proved me to be the fool, new fan of Ian now.
Loved that video. Could listen to Poults describe his thought process all day. Rick with a few worldies too.
Ian seems like a really nice guy. This was very Entertaining. Well done Lads.
He is a fun guy
I don’t feel like you think through your short game well enough and rush it. Not enough respect for your stance, the club face and the way you hit the ball 🤷🏻‍♂️
#10 "FORE RIGHT!!!" Ian's look. Very comical.
Great video and love the thought process insights. 👍🏌️‍♂️👍
My new favorite golfer, Ian is the best!!
Simply amazing golf! So many epic shots, one after the other. Ian’s a true sportsman and very entertaining. I really like his suggestion on your next challenge as well. Would love to see you up against Stenson.
TOOK MR RYDER CUP TO THE 18TH MY FAVOURITE EVER PRO SHOULD BE VERY SATISFIED WITH YOUR VALIENT EFFORT
Such good fun!
Great video! But RICK...why you playing that hero shot at 1:12:00????
you fell apart like a cheap suit🤣 pouter is a pure dude😎
Epic video, Ian comes across as an incredibly humble and genuine guy and he was able to turn on the class over the last few holes to win the match. And somehow when you asked who to challenge next, I was saying Henrik! Let's hope you get that one sorted. 😲
Brilliant video. Real golf entertainment. Ian is a legend and a great guy to have a round of golf with. Imagine playing probably the greatest match play golfer ever. Goose bumps stuff.
Great video. Ian seems like a super guy. Enjoyed the comms throughout
I love watching these videos as you get to know the player. I’ve been a fan of Ian’s since he first came out on the European tour. This just solidifies my appreciation of his game.
Loved this episode. So entertaining
I love this style of video. I for one could listen to the pros talk there way round the golf course all day. The knowledge and skill for the golf is mind blowing. Great video
I don’t know why I love watching these videos so much haha
Great watch gents. Really enjoyed Ian in this challenge, golf legend.
You just don't want to play this guy one-on-one....he is MONEY.
Real question: How good do you have to be to use a green towel? 🙃
IMO, the "brave" shot on 13 was good for match play, but not good if you're trying to protect your lead in stroke play.  GREAT video - shout out to Ian for being such a class guy and fantastic Ryder Cup player - one of the best ever.
1:42:40 hahahahah
jeez this video has popped
Who else knew that eagle putt was gonna be miles short? Lol
Hearing how a top golf pro navigates their way round a course is fascinating, and shows the ridiculous level of talent and insight these guys have. Great video!
GET HOVLAND ON!
Unbelievable watch Rick & Poults!
Pro class...wow...
Hilarious! Ian’s a great player and it was a pleasure to watch him on your 10 shot challenge series! Well played you missed an all square by a hair! Looking forward to the next one.
Poults played brutal but still gets level par just shows ya how good these guys are
Brilliant watch. Poults is a legend
wunderbar
Great video as always Rick.
This course looks so narrow and bloody difficult lol.
I never liked Ian Poulter. I thought he was a jerk for some reason. After watching this and the interview you guys did with him, he seems like such a cool person.
Please play Tyrrell Hatton! Would be absolutely class!!!
Going to LIV is proof this man has integrity and puts his family first. Love he had his son with him on this video!!!
No doubt about it - this one was the one!! - thank you Rick & Ian
Loved this video and looking forward to the rest of the series. X x
Makes me laugh every time he says “im just going to try and fade one in there” and proceeds to hit a draw every time. Who is he kidding? 😂
Hilarious looks to camera by Ian. Great video
Stunning course what a match. Good fun 👍🏻
I can beat poulter if you give me 30 to 40 strokes!!!
This is your best video so far, Rick.  Poulter was amazing.  I’ve always been neutral on him, but now I’m a legit fan.  Great insight into his thought process
Didn’t know much about poulter  before this video or the golf life one, but the guy seems like an absolute diamond of a geezer
That was absolutely brilliant. Ian was class. You obviously got on well. Brilliant watch!x
I’ve never really been a fan of Poulter as a tour player, but I knew before I even watched this video that he was going to be a really, nice guy. I love how positive he is on every shot. Best challenge so far in the series.
Always liked Ian Poulter . Sorta remined me of a tall version of Rod Stewart in his younger years . Aaah Better lookin though lol
This is obnoxiously good content. Better than 90% of what comes out of the streaming services these days.
Pouter is quite the cheeky chap, isn't he.  All of the knowing side-eye glances at the camera made this video epic.
Great watch, thanks guys
I will be honest, I haven't been the biggest fan of Mr.Poulter for a long time and I have been totally wrong about him for entirely. What class. Great person. One of my favorite 10 shot challenges.
I'm 100% for the Stenson next time. We need those passive agressive sarcastic nordic comments :D
Watching this, I feel like the Heckler from Happy Gilmore.  "Man, this guy SUCKS."
That was one of the most enjoyable video  I’ve watched! Kudos to you both!
Mistake in the counting: pouleter was -1 thru 1 and not E.
Ian and Rick defines why Golf is the best sport on planet earth. The joy from these guys is spinning round the world. Applause from Stockholm, Sweden. (Looking forward to Stenson challenge). Awesome!
Hey Rick, how about some celeb challenges too - bring back pro-celebrity golf??
What a great video.  Kudos to IP for being such a great sport and a legend.
Yes challenge Henrik Stenson, and do it somewhere in Sweden. Golf On 🤘
Epic video
Edit: Never a lost ball... hmmm... imagine that kind of help. My rounds would score significantly different. I'm not even half way through this and I can say that the difference between a pro and armature is confidence. Not much else. Of course there is consistency, but that comes from confidence. A pro looks at a hard shot and gets excited. They're also always thinking more about what's for dinner when putting! No nerves here, it's just a game. What a beautiful course. I'm surprised nobody is talking about the little things, like the green growth direction. Seems it could explain more of Rick's putting misreads. A bit discombobulated swings. I wouldn't say either of them had good tempo that day. Feels very encouraging for those of us in the "play a few times a year" club.
Rick, love the content!
I think there were some drinks involved in the making of this video lol! Total class boys; I love it!
1:42:55 now that takes skill
He was just as good on golf life with Jimmy Bullard too. Brilliant
Loved every second of this. Poulter was not on my best list but have to be honest, he’s a genuinely great guy. So much banter and fun. Amazing video. (Sorry not sorry 😂)
What a player, what a gentleman, helping you to make the correct choices and telling us all about his choices. The one we always wanted to watch in the Ryder Cup, I hope he'll be able to be involved again, he'd be a great captain too
Rick this video is world class 😂😂
I have not read all the notes, however, I  simply do not understand why you do not try and hit the ball straight and use your tricks when required ? That is all the tour pro’s seem to do.
This is a great video Rick, and Poulter is absolutely fantastic listening to his thought processes and course management is a fantastic lesson, a real insight into a great players mind. Thank you for bringing the video to us, and thanks to Ian for being such an amazing guest! Keep up the great work!
"I also like my teeth."  Ha!  This was a lot of fun to watch. Ian grinding for that par on 7 as if it was for a win on tour. These guys are just next level. And he's really funny and very kind.
It's really special the amount of time he takes to explain what to do for your shot and what he is trying to do for his shot. It's great to hear the mind of a pro at work.
Probably one of the most entertaining bits of sport I have seen in some time. Thanks for sharing
I know its probably chilly....but your jacket HAS to be a factor in your early pulls/pushes.
This was pure gold. Both as entertainment and as a great golf strategy lesson by the legend Ian Poulter. Thanks a lot Rick and keep it up❤
Amazing, agree, the best so far. Love the way Ian picked up the divots on no 17. Tells You a lot about the man and his character. Can´t wait for the next one!! :) Rick, how the .. is anybody gonna compete with You on Youtube with this content!! Impossible.
A true Ryder cup hero & a fellow gooner.come on mr poulter
What a match against a true legend in Ian poulter.
When they held up their “battered” golf balls 😂😂 cleaner than any ball in my bag
you could beat ian starting 10 over par
Great video and game, and banter great too! You both said it wasnt your best golf which is golf eh. Rick looking more like a 10 handicapper these days 😮 Not mesning to sound negative but wondered what you reckon your playing off these days if you were back to having amateur status?
Absolutely different class content these are Rick. Gives a great insight into what these elite players of the game are thinking about on the course. Makes for great viewing. Big Henrik would be epic also 🏌️‍♂️
Got to practice your drive Rick... you almost got him !!! awesome !!!
I was captivated all the way. Great match and Poulter seems like a helluva nice guy.  I’ma new fan of his!
What a video! Your best yet imo Rick. Ian is such a gentleman and a treat to watch. And you guys have great chemistry on camera
Rick u need a chipper in ya bag like M Crossfield 😂🎉
might be more ads then golf holes...
This was amongst the best golf vlogs I've watched.  Ian's "asides" to camera were priceless.  I was fortunate enough to play all three Woburn courses recently and this brought back great memories.  IP is such fierce competitor and still so likeable.
Never Stop Oil!!!!!!❤❤❤❤
Rick, your channel is such great motivation. After the first two holes I said to myself "If these two are professional golfers then maybe I can be a pro too."
I really love the explaining of the thought processes on almost all shots Ian plays
First time I've heard British guys say that they like their teeth
Stenson would be sic ,he is a real joker
In the words of the great Ricky Shiels..... "Bloody phenomenal!" 😎🤘
Superb video, Poults was so engaging and open. Your best video by far.
Love Poult's to bits. Everyone laughed at me when I said we were going to win the Ryder Cup after he banged in that birdie putt on 18 at Medinah & we were getting our arses handed to us. Wished I'd put our house on it at 66/1.
Prob not
Ian was great
Watched the video in full, really entertaining and played in great spirits, that looks a proper tough course. Great video well done Rick.
More Postman!  All class all the time.
I will be honest. Prior to this video I was not a fan of Ian. I think mainly because of what I felt was over the top antics he displayed on the golf course. I know people have their own way to get in their “zone” to be able to better focus and execute at a higher level, I just didn’t like the way he did it. This video showed the “human” side of him and I really like it.  Am I now a fan? Maybe! But not during the Ryder Cup!😂
Ian is just the kind of guy you want to spend a day on the course with. What a genuinely nice guy.
Best guest by a mile! Quality video and quality insight & guidance from Poults.
That up and down on 6 is why he’s on tour.  That’s what separates tour pros from the rest of the golfers.  I’m making at least double if I’m where Ian was.  Phenomenal !!!
Another great video, laughing out loud all the way through. Golf was shite but both of you are so entertaining. Massive respect to Ian and his family.
AWESOME!!
Ian comes across as a decent guy would be a fun round
This is the best video you’ve posted and you’ve had some great ones! Poults was UNBELIEVABLE with walking and talking us through every shot. This was the best video I’ve ever watched on you tube.
Awesome, just awesome Rick. Superb video and what a battle down to the last putt with Poulter.  Hold your head up high despite losing you create such a fantastic story, this is some of the best golf content on you tube.  Hat off to Poults too 🙌🏼
I was really hoping that Poulter was going to try that 3 wood slice he was talking about at 43:22
Ian seems like a really nice guy! He's got a new fan 😂
If you’ve never hit yourself in the ankle, are you even a golfer!?
Like most inland courses, it would be massively improved with a chain saw.
Really enjoy watching these challenges.  Great job!
Holy shit this was fuN‼️‼️‼️
This made me really like Ian, super good dude. Great match boys!
Poulter is so funny.
8:52 the reason I am watching this channel 😅
course is crazyyy tight.
Thank you Rick for the numerous genuine smiles you've given us with these videos
Not a drop of arrogance with Ian. Down to earth awesome bloke
I really hope they play again, a really enjoyable and informative video.
I love these 10 shot challenges because you get to see the other side of the golfer.  The personable side.
The tour pro fetching the divots, sums him up
Really enjoying this - Ian is a great guest, so genuine and relaxed. Thanks Rick for another top vid.
The section where Poults plays off the path around 33 mins is just an absolute joy. Poults giving a ridiculous level of insight into why he chooses to play off the path when 99.9% of amateur golfers would just instinctively take the free drop (if available) without a second thought is an amazing lesson. Couple that with Rick just laughing in the background at how lucky he is to be getting that sort of insight from Poulter and then seeing Rick's sheer joy and amazement when Poults pulls the shot off exactly as he described (albeit not to his own incredibly high standards) is wonderful. Brilliant video Rick - thank you!
Brilliant match, great video, gives us all hope knowing even great players don’t always hit great shots and love Poulter, what a gent, more great content from Rick.
Nice content rick...wish you the best👍
This episode by far is my favorite of this series!!! Well played
That dap at the beginning was crispy
Don't you just love Ian Poulter - Awesome guy and such a great sport - Love the commentary and the thought process is fantastic -  Brillant video thanks Rick
this might be your best ever video
Next challenge.....give the people what they want.....................TIGER
people have already said this but what a great bloke Ian is
Absolutely luv these challenges...this is the best one yet!
I have just become an Ian Poulter fan. As an American I didn’t like him because of his perceived arrogance during the Ryder cup, but he is genuinely trying to be silly and I really enjoyed this video Rick!
Well played Mr Paulter. Excellent golf and great humour. Fantastic guest and we’ll played both. 👍😀
Ian hasn't changed since the days of Cams and Beds matches with Lee, both Home and abroad. A great golfer, a gentleman, and a must for the Ryder Cup!!!!!
Mr. Ian is an absolute gentleman, very much enjoyed the match.
Quality video . Shame about the 7000 adverts
What a series! Badass! 🎉
Best 10 shot challenge yet. The postman delivered. And fantastic to hear him talk through each hole and shot.
What’s with this new American sounding “dayum” out of Rick, weird
This was my favorite one of these challenges you've done. It was a pleasure to watch. As an American it pains me to say this but The Postman always delivers.
Every time they go to putt there’s an advert 😡
That was very entertaining.  You guys probably hated it but watching you play in the trees was great.  It's where most of us play from!
Crazy golf 😂
any reason Rick kept saying Damn in an American accent every hole 😂
What a great video! Loved every minute of it!
Ian! What an absolute legend.
Epic!
Great guest. Really easy going guy
Wow, what a video. Huge thanks to Ian for his openness, the insight he gives into his thought process/shot selection is amazing. I couldn’t peel myself away from this one!
Best 10-shot-challenge ever. Thanks for that epic contest.  Phenomenal 🎉
Legend...
your 13th hole is like every hole for me everytime!
I’ve got to say Ian Poulter comes across as a genuine good bloke.
Gee I’d hate to play behind you Rick, there must be times you take 10-15 minutes to hit a shot with all the dramatisation you insert
Wow, what a great video. Ian is a masterclass sportsman and a down to Earth guy. Super glad I watched this video. It's so sad how the LIV golfers had their names and reputations dragged through the mud only for the leagues to join. Where are the apologies now? Those same journalist just get to act as if they were not purposely trying to hurt their careers and life's work. Good on you Ian for keeping your head held high.
super impressed by poults, honestly came across so humble and friendly. when people ask you can have a round with 3 others he's certainly jumped into consideration after seeing this. quality
Been watching you for years and i think this was my favorite video of all time
Absolute legends the both of you
Best yet Rick!
I feel like I’m watching NBC’s coverage of the Open with all these commercials!
Best video yet Rick! Kept me on the edge of my seat and was awesome how interactive Ian was!
Ian is a great sport, but I still enjoy James Robinson more. Play him Rick.
Surely Ian Poulter is Rod Stewart’s love child ? Credit to you Rick,he is genuinely impressed with your  play.. and you hold your own against a world class seasoned pro.. on his home course …well done 👍⛳️
Brilliant!!👏👏👏
I was at Madinah and the crap talking from the crowd at Ian was intense at times.  Didnt phase him one bit.
This is my favorite video you’ve posted thus far Rick. I’ve always liked Ian, but I’ve gained a massive amount of appreciation for him and his character after watching him interact with you and giving us, the viewers, great entertainment. Of course, you always deliver yourself! Thanks so much for your hard work.
I'm starting to think Rick intentionally plays terrible on the front just for the content
This episode was amazing Ian poulter is such a good guy what a match and how good was he with all the thought process in between each shot that kind of insight you pay for a on course lesson
Ian Poulter is the best guest ever on this channel.
What a finish! I mean, if you had to pick anyone to somehow pull it off going down the last ...
Absolutely outrageous 👏🏼
Best guest ever. I’ve always liked Poults since I read his back story. Ryder cup hero and thoroughly nice bloke, no airs and graces just like two old mates playing together.
Ricks got bhunda
Thanks again Rick, another great video! Ian is such a solid guy, I have always really liked him! Best of luck Ian for the future!
Poulter made me realise just how much detail the top guys think of! Fantastic!
Quality….Top man Poulter….Almost a result Rick….Really enjoyable watch…👏👏👏
Always love the 10 shot challenges with the Tour Pros. Would be interesting to watch you give 10 strokes to an amateur and see if you can catch them
Enjoy these very much. For many reasons, I don't necessarily cheer you to win, but love seeing you trying best. Subscribing.
Ian Poulter made this video so enjoyable!! I really enjoyed listening to his thinking throughout the round. What a great guy. Always fun to watch Rick. Thanks for the great videos.
Rick your golf has gotten worse since I subscribed to you years ago… haha😂
The last hole alone would have made an epic episode.. Ian Poulter absolute legend
Ian--- I just love that guy.
at 1:43:10, I just love Ian laughing
4 minutes 38 in to this vid and I'm howling 😂😂
raking in the money with ads every 2 minutes.  Otherwise good videos.
This was absolutely the best 10 shot challenge video so far! Ian was so great! Really enjoyed every minute of this video!
What a nice guy 🤘
The best challenge so far. Hugely entertaining, thanks to Ian’s brilliant sense of humour 🎉
Ian might not have been playing his best, but you started to see the fierseome competitor he is in the last few holes, that 3 wood!  Great sense of humour too.  Absolute legend as is Rick.  Agree with others, best one yet by a country mile.
Fantastic video. Great to watch but more importantly to listen to.
Really good fun to watch that. Ian is such a great guy. Heart on sleeve for sure and made that round super.
Well Rick, you played ok, with a little bit of bad luck. You have to stop dsropping shots at the beginning!! Other than that, you could have won. Great putting, and great entertaining golf, and with Ian Poulter explanations, and thought processes,... great tips for us all.  Thank you for another great Pro challenge. Bad luck Rick, your time will come!
Brilliant video , really enjoyed it , good fun to see you in the places I normally go 😂
Anyone know the brand rick uses for his golf bag?
I feel like Rick is rushing his swing with his driver... Like his tempo is too fast..
That was cool
This was great with all the commenting and thought process of Ian, great!
Best challenge yet! Poults was awesome with his time and commentary along the way. Best yet!! Oh, but your 'draw' is looking more and more like a hook 😂
How did I know he would lose on the làst hole! A bit of a fix. We know you dont shoot these scores
Mr Poulter made the match with his asides and other comments!  Excellent show! Keep up the good work!
I've enjoyed the whole series but Ian has to be the best guest to date, if for no other reason that his comfortability in engaging with you and the camera. He is a real legend, isn't he? And while we didn't see 'tournament winning' golf, we did see some superb ball striking from you both. Very entertaining content. Thanks Rick.
Love this series. One of the best and Rick has stepped up his game!
Mr Poulter is a legend it was a “like” on the way in
Ian had a comment on the 10th tee about you having a 4 hole cushion (rather than 4 stroke). This gave me the idea that it might be fun to watch a revised format where you start 5 or 6 "holes" up rather than 10 under par, then play out the 18 holes as Match Play. It would be fun to watch and might be a really interesting twist.
I just can't watch this slaughter......and it's just the first hole😮
Great episode. Thanks Rick!
Ian is amazing, if i ever get to play with a pro, thats the one I want. Real class act
WHat a great video and match - the best ever, and the interplay with Ian was fantastic!!
Fantastic video. Ian Poulter was brilliant. Listening to his detailed analysis of every shot shows how much attention goes into a top pro's game. That final hole was pure class.
You still out there embarassing yourself shielsy
Ian just makes you want to play a round with him. Top bloke!
What a gem of a human being Poulter seems to be. Good on him.
Besides being highly entertaining, the big takeaway from this video is that Ian Poulter is a good dude.
This has to be the best 10 shot challenge yet. Well worth the wait. Loved how Ian painted the picture for every hole and showed some real class throughout. Great banter and some cracking shots from you Rick. Last hole putt off to decide the match. Poults maintains the wins for the Tour Pro's. Epic. Well done 👏
Really enjoyed that 👍
God damn do I love this series. I get excited every time it shows up in my feed. Very admirable showing from you Rick. You hit a ton of brilliant shots in this round. And you make a bunch of clutch shots at the end. Man that would have been epic if that final approach shot had gone in. Superb putts on 17 and 18 to give yourself every chance. Enjoyed every minute of Ian's instruction, banter, and humor. You two got on really well. Loved the whole show.
Another great episode Rick, smiled from start to finish. Proper bloke is Poults, encouraging you, laughing  Top episode ❤️👏👏👏👏
i play off 8 and still beat Rick lol
Ian is a class act.  Who wouldn’t want to play a round of golf with a tour pro that has that much fun and charm while they play?  I think he wanted you to win….
Mr P is a top class person and pro - what a superb video.
Enjoyed every minutes of this great game ! Bravo for the quality of the video that gave me the impression to be there as well !
What an amazing video Rick! ive watched Poulter since i was young. hes a true gentleman and absoulety unreal golfer ! fair play on 18th that wouldve been some win! please do another one with HIM!!
This is such a good video 😂👏🏻👏🏻
35:00 that putt turned you into a broken old man , put ten years on you in about a second 🤣
Amazing, loved every second of this! Rick so good with Ian, so much respect and alot of quality golf shots, and some not so quality but hey, that's golf. "What if I roof this" killed me😂😂😂
god I can't believe Rick(being a pro) is this bad as golf
Can't get my head around how much Ian takes spin into factor for each shot at the green. Something I need to really work on and keep an eye on as well. Thanks Rick! Love seeing the best of the best work their way around the course!
Legendary content 🔥
Great video. The pros always find a way Rick. Golf is such a great game. Friendships are made through 18 holes. Well done, Ian Poulter. The Postman always delivers 👏
Literally Ian was a caddie today and a professional golfer…  Rick you couldn’t of got anymore help if ya tried 😂.  Nah it’s genuinely so good to hear Ian chat & what a player.
Great video. Poults was a gentleman
Best vid yet Rick, Ian is a legend, love every minute!
Much bigger fan of Ian Poulter after watching this!
Challenge Bryson Dechambeau!
Ian cleaning his clubs and the greens are the most satisfying thing ever
I remember when he caught me and my mate we bunted on he started to hit balls at us this was going back some 20 years ago he was with Alex Hay.
Really enjoyed that. Ian is a great bloke and very entertaining.
So many adverts
Ummm 😳 Holly heck buddy ur golf game has seen bettr days I hope ur healthy man and happy
2 hrs, really? 🤣🤣🤣
I think Mr. Poulter has managed to make the competition hotter... Very diplomatic on his part... But Rick made some good shots though.
If u say absolutely or to be honest one more time I will vomit!
Rick hitting his ankle with his wedge was the most relatable thing I’ve ever seen on YouTube Golf.
I appreciate your humility, Rick. Golf is tough and starting double, double always sucks
IP is awesome with you Rick! This was the best 10shot challenge by far. You guys should team up more often.
This was the best one yet! Top content.
Such an Achievement Rick well done, Me and my son were chuffed we got to shout you on as you cycled past ❤
I've always held a bit of a negative view of Ian, but heck, was I wrong. He is actually a very likable chap. He was fun, but showed respect and gentlemanship throughout. These 10-shot challenge videos are the best. What about challenging Louis Oosthuizen or Ernie Els (Wentworth)? Both gents can play a bit, love to heckle, and would be fantastic company.
Rick, you try and hit draws and fades, why not just stick to your natural shot and build consistency from there?
This was great
What an absolute gent!  So classy, genuine and brilliant Ian Poulter is.  His golf mind is so superb, hit almost everything shot as described then hit a tree to show he's not a machine.  Brilliant video
Unreal episode 👌🏽👍🏽👍🏽
This was quality, so much more info and insight.
A true lesson in the way golf should be played, not just the quality of the shots and Ian's way of guiding Rick, but his etiquette, fixing pitch marks tending the flag and replacing divots....a proper gent Ian Poulter.
Great stuff this,listening to how a Pro sees his shot,unreal content 👏👏👏👏
Really good watch. Well done
A very gentlemanly and fun round!! Thank you both for your time …it was great seeing you both enjoy 👍🏻
1:29:30 thanks for choosing this song. It is an absolute banger. I looked it up and it's called A Tender Heart by Brock Hewitt
Extremely funny exciting educational to the golf world.
Thanks Rick for this amazing video! I’ve always had respect and admiration for Ian Poulter and the way he plays golf, but after watching this round and the round he played with Jimmy Bullard and Lee Westwood, and the way he gives insight and coaching while still giving 100% to playing the best he can for this channel and the golf life channel, my respect for Ian has grown 100 fold what a gentleman he is plus a bit of banter and camaraderie, which for us plebs is probably the best part of the game we play! Thanks again Rick
Hi Rick, seeing as it looks like you’re sponsored by Lyle & Scott, why not advertise it and add a discount code for your subscribers? I like wearing L&S golf wear. 😉
Best one yet, Poults was a brilliant guest, lovely guy!!
Fantastic, I couldn’t stop watching. Ian sharing his insights to each shot. Love this series with the tour pros, thanks Rick and team.
That was just great!
Rick, your swing is very wristy, lots of hand movement and not in sync with your body. It makes for very inconsistent golf. Just a tip 😉
Ricks not a scratch player more like +5. Which is still good
I love the way how Ian is talking about taking spin off the ball to get a more controlled shot whereas must of us amateurs want to get as much spin and zip as possible.
Great stuff all round ... what a charming guy Ian Poulter is ... we've all supported him in the Ryder Cup but great to hear all his thought processes...
Ian Poulter was a fantastic gentleman, my favorite of the Beat the Pro series so far - keep 'em coming Rick - you're bound to nail one eventually! :)
Ther're chunky shots
Great episode Rick! Try to get Henrik Stenson sometime!
Ian Poulter is a legend - what a nice fella
Great video, love poults even more than I did!! 👍👍👍👍👍
Great video, fascinating hearing Ian's  thoughts.
Super Super challenge.  What a Pro Ian Poulter is and WHAT A GREAT BLOKE. Generous with his course comments and insights.  I could almost feel the temperature change as he switched on to win!  Fantastic. .... oh and unlucky Rick!!
So enjoyable to see you guys play. Iam has shown his honest self and human-golf sıtuation (not super human). It is what all golfers do. Impressive the way Ian accepted the not-so-good golf shots. Whereas, Rick seemed nervous and also shows how difficult it is for every shot to work especially within competition. Well done guys and nice to enjoy a little conclusive climax.
What a legend Poulter is….
Absolute favorite guest you have had. This Ian was made for YouTube. He is a class act. Lovely insight on his thought process.
This video brought me such joy! Honestly the best golf content out there. I’m already a Rick fan, and now I’m an Ian fan. What a class act
@RickShielsPGA made me discover Ian Poulter. I am going to follow him more. thank you. I have a request. When you will go back to USA, would it be possible to play a 10 under with Freddie Couples ? this would rock I believe ?!!!  john Daly would be fun too, but well, you choose at the end whom is available... thanks for your work !
I really don't feel bad about my last round now, after seeing you two struggle.  In my defense though, my last round was with a brand new set of clubs. I was all over the place, and my short irons/wedges were just exploding off the face.
Ian Poulter awesome! He’s the best.
Just insane that ending, gripped every minute - both played some golf like we all do and competitive banter along the way! Smashed it.
So grateful Ian took the time to spend with all of us for the ride.  Massive thanks for these videos!
I can't stop re-watching this video...this is EPIC! Ian is such a good guy and funny as Hell. And this turned out to be way better than if you guys both shot 5 under.
Token southpaw on the channel here! Love the reviews, can’t wait for more!!
ians the man best episode
Great watch. Love Poults. Incredibly open and giving of his thinking on course. Thanks Rick top class my friend
BEST VIDEO EVER
Rick you wouldn’t  be able to look at yourself if you won .Poulter is such a nice bloke giving you a lot of advice on all those crazy shots you had to play . Big fan for doing this series.
What’s ricks actual handicap??? He’s definitely not a scratch golfer he’s woeful…
The more I watch your videos, the more you make me realize any golfer can get exposure. Kudos to you you show your golf skills.
Best vid on the channel. Smiled right through 😂
Love watching these, its great watching tour pros play, seeing how they manage to scramble and not make doubles after a couple of poor shots is amazing (15th for example). I would have been looking at 8 or 9 at best.
Hey Rick. Of all the great pros you've had on your channel, Ian Poulter has been my absolute favourite. What a gentleman and what a player. Really awesome guest. Thanks Rick and Thank You Ian Poulter...most enjoyable.
Sir Porter, What a player!. Mr. Rick, What a video!. Ian Poulter is with Seve the Rider cup legends and we enjoy a lot that you share with us this incredible round of golf!. Thanks Rick for these moments!. Thanks Ian for your unbeateble heart!.
What an amazing video. What a guest Ian was as well. So much insight into what they think about with every shot. Amazing personality on camera as well. One of my favourite videos you have done 🎉
Always loved Ian’s passion.
Fabulous video…enjoyed it.
123:06 - No one is laughing at that.... Nope, complete legend, Mr Poulter, complete legend...
The calculations these guy deciding what to shoot are amazing when honestly most of the rest of us are like 140 to the green.. that’s my 8 iron hopefully I hit this straight 😂
I wasn't an Ian Poulter fan until this video. I felt like I was one of the foursome hanging with you guys. That was so much fun Ian is a funny guy. And how dramatic that was right to the very end.  This is certainly better than watching the news thanks for putting this up!
Gained massive respect for Ian for being super relatable and otherworldly composed even when he's not playing his best. What a guy
I really enjoyed this video. Ian was great and I am even more of a fan now!
Great to watch, guys. ❤
Have eaten there a few times 50oz 🤭and we have always loved it glad to hear you enjoyed it as much as us 👌🏻
BEST GUEST! <3 ian
Rick came to play on that opening tee shot of that 18th!
MY heart was racing on that 17th hole!!!!
Wanna see you play with Tiger and Charlie
Great watch. One of the best. Poulter was great too 👍🏼👏🏼
Absolutely one of your best videos, Ian is just such a legend and very generous with his time and knowledge 👌
Best one so far.
Ian is a rockstar! What a great guy!!!
Poulter is by far my fav player, what a gent also. Fav episode so far and Faldo was great
What a class act. This was so enjoyable to watch, thank you so much, both of yas!
Is rick using a vapor fly wood
Why does Rick never account for his big draw? Every video he kills himself by not playing his draw properly.
One of the best 10 under par videos yet.  Ian talking through his shots was awesome, that is something the PGA should adopt.   FYI your 2 iron into par five was the shot of the round
Who else is watching this over 5 days lol
absolutely best game, better than PGA games
Poulter is a cross between Rod Stewart and Tony Robinson
1:43:00 Ians face on the 17th after the tree 🤣🤣🤣 priceless! Great watch guys
Bring on Henrik!
Absolutely brilliant watch. The entertainment value was amazing and Ian Poulter what a man👏🏼
What a Pleasure to have Ian on the Channel. I love seeing these amazing Tour Pros out on a Casual Round you get to see that they are just like every other Golfer just with more Knowledge Skill & Talent.. Thanks Rick & Ian Pleasure Mate
Most enjoyable golf video I've seen in a long time. The insight into the thought process Ian shared was just so detailed, big respect to him. Thanks guys.
What a gret player and personalaty  you are a lucky person to be able to meet such people, keep up the good work
Omg amazing video! What a great guy Ian is. When you hit that tree on the 17th and the camera panned to Ian laughing his arse off must be the best YouTube content I’ve ever seen. Absolute quality Rick. 😂
“Thhhhhaaaaaaatt”
Best golf video I’ve ever seen….several new things for me….watched it on Apple TV instead of squinting at my phone….video quality is amazing!!….greens are perfect….golf is honest with natural ups and downs….banter is great and for some strange reason Ian poulter feels like my new bestie and I’ve never met the man???….simply fantastic!❤❤❤❤
The postman delivers on 12
Did you let Josh play?
By far my favourite guest you've had. What a true gentleman and I loved his openness and insight into his (and your) game. Truly fantastic stuff here.
I didn’t like Ian very much until listening and watching this video . But what a nice bloke and good golfer sorry Ian for my first thoughts .
Great game great competition ! If you ever come to Thailand and do not mind getting beat by a 74 year old look me up and bring money !! hahahha
Ian is the Ultimate Team Player, would love to see you play some team based games with him in the future.
I know a lot of my fellow Americans aren't always big Ian Poulter fans, but I think he's an amazing golfer and personality.  And, as this video shows, he's a genuinely nice guy as well as one of the most intelligent golfers out there.
Ian Poulter-- what a class act!  I am now a fan of his and will be cheering him on!  One of your best videos ever, Rick!
Interesting, been watching for years and drives seem to fade.....
Stellar... what an absolute gem of a  bloke. Ian Poulter has always been one of my all-time favourite golfers. Now I know why😊
I was absolutly so captivated the entire round. What a Legend Ian is, as are you Rick. I can't even. #Nailbiter, Good show mate
Poulter seems like a great fella
I don't see how anyone could hate Mr. Poulter, he is a great fellow, I will just have to hate during the Ryder Cup, if he gets to play, it would be a shame if he didn't.
Absolutely epic mate, A+ content
Congrats Guy on that awesome 6!
Do this with Jim Furyk
Course looks brutal.
When you gonna loose vs Trevino?
Before watching this, for some reason, I thought I didn’t like Poulter, no idea why. But now, what a dude he is, could watch him all day
Man, I love Rick. He's a great guy. But I've stopped watching the past like 6 videos less than halfway through. For someone who golfs as much as he does he should be improving. I just get so bored with his underwhelming playing. I'll still say subbed and (try to) watch his videos but it's just so boring.
Best guest so far, thoroughly enjoyed this video.
Poulter has so much game.  And he’s at his home course despite living a road.   Awesome video.
I enjoyed that properly. Instructive and entertaining. Thanks Ian and Rick!
fabulous pro,,, great video
Ian gained a fan for sure! Top notch content
Rick looking a bit round these days. Gota chill on the sausee rolls
Absolute brilliant. Poulter a class act ⛳️
Can someone repeat the joke at 29,56? Can’ t get it. Thks
Pouts was by far the best legend
One of your absolutely best comps ever, pleasure to watch, cheers.
This was class 👏
Why don’t you ask the Pro why u always go left or right? Others channels have pro’s on nd they give education to ppl.
i loved the match. Really entertaining. Rick, well done, hanging in there after that awful start. To be honest, i didn't know Negan was such a great golf player before the zombie apocalypse..... i just thought he was great with a baseball bat 😁.
What a great episode to watch.  Very funny and great to see a tour professional having fun and a laugh.  Very entertaining 😁👍
What a video! Amazing guest to have going through his thought process. Well done shiels
I think this has been your best matchup video. Ian is awesome! It’s so great to hear him talk through each shot. I’d love to have a round with him. I feel like his knowledge and expertise could take 10 strokes off my round
If Rick had a fairway finder club then he would have beat Ian hands down, maybe hit 3wood on those par 4s around the 400yrd and less holes
I have always had a lot of respect for Ian but this has taken it to another level. What a true gentleman, always willing to share the knowledge of the course and how to play shots. Once again a top class person.
Funny how he brings two clubs to chip off the fringe, knowing full well he gonna putt lol
Both repairing their divots on 12 with tees... I'd argue it's much easier and better for preserving the green using a proper divot tool.
After watching the podcast whith Ian, and this round, I am definitely a big fan of him now. Just comes across so genuine,  loved it! Great video.
Ian is my favorite!  He is Sir Ryder to every lover of the game.
This has to be the worst YouTube “pro” golfer out there
What a fantastic video! So nice and fun to watch. And the loud thinking is overly precious. Thank you for this!
Yep loved that Rick ❤
So exciting golf match and so educational too 👍⛳️ Maybe the best of all Rick’s videos…ever…or what do you think?
When Ian was trying to hide his laugh when Rick hit the tree was best bit for me. Class game well done guys.
Please challenge Henrik Stenson 🎉
I think this was my fav vid of the year. Such a good watch and Ian was great for the camera. Editing was awesome.
Find it quite irritating that Rick is a very famous golf YouTuber but he cant afford a pitch repair or ball marker 😅
love it
You carry your emotions openly, You were really affected on No. 13 and you could not hide it as much s you tried. From Ian telling you not to play the hook super shot to your reaction after the double bogey. But i really love these videos they are really helpful and I learn a lot.. Thank you for being open.
That last hole was great. Well done both men.
best guest so far! great stuff
Great fun! Very cool video, Congrats
I love this type of content Rick - having Ian with you 'on the bag' going thru decision making on each hole is great. And kudos for Ian taking time out of his day to spend time with all of us. One of my favorite (favourite) players. Love his clutch play, desire to win and intensity. I wish Ian and his lovely family the best.
This is one of your best videos❤️
2 HOURS???????  My lord.
Great job buddy - you're an inspiration
Ian is one of greatest players for the game. His energy and charisma playing this sport is one of a kind. Absolutely one of my most favorite players!
Massey from Tallahassee
A Tour pro using a mallet putter, and Rick using the blade... Hmmm... You'd think Rick might learn something from that!
I did a shot every time Rick said "right". Im sh*t faced
One of the most entertaining ones to date!  Good effort Rick.  Def work with Ian again!  Maybe a 4 man scramble and you and guy each take a pro ;)
THAT was money! Thoroughly enjoyed that. My absolute favorite video so far! Ian definitely has to come back on the show. Thank you Rick!
You always see these pro golfers in tournaments on tv. They are obviously that zoned in and concentrating, (rightly so, there’s a lot on the line). That they can come across as snobby and stiff. Videos like this let you see the person. Ian Poulter, what a guy. See the video Poulter did with Lee Westwood and Jimmy Bullard on Tubes Golf life channel. What a vid.
Using tees in the green… ahhhhhh…. Even Ian clocked it on the 10th at 1:01:22
Best video ever!! Such a great team.
Best player yet what a champion
The production of Rick's videos has got to be the up there with the best on YouTube 👌 keep it up sir.
New drinking game. Every time Rick says he is going to try to hit a fade or cut but hits a draw instead, you have to take a shot of liquor.
I noticed tour pros with there towels always cleaning wipeing clubs it is there figit gadget
Best video to date. The chemistry is unreal. Ian seems like such a great guy!
Honestly this match makes me want to start playing golf again.
Great video, Ian comes across as such a nice bloke. Thanks Rick
Totally nuts watching this funny as hell ian was brilliant with his running commentary on your shots to camera.
Excellent watch 🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♂️
Fantastic viewing, really enjoyed this video and Ian is a great watch too.
Brilliant video content. Loved the fact Ian talked us through his shot selection and how we would approach each hole. Really interesting!
The postman always delivers,what an awesome video,loved every minute of it,Team Europe wake up and pick Ian
Wasn’t too sure how this was going to play out, but enjoyed more than expected! Great content and Poults was insightful throughout
Epic! Down to the wire, very entertaining thank you. Ian was so nice as well after seeing Rick getting off to a rocky start. Watched it in a few sittings, enjoyed every sitting.
Yeh that's was awesome Rick, thanks to you and Poulter for great entertainment. I really was hoping for a play off 😂
❤!!!
Good match hard luck Rick so close eh
Loved Ian what a character, well done guys very entertaining!
Ian Poulter was such a gentleman and a great player here. Thoroughly enjoyed this video. What a character. Can’t wait for the next pro challenge.
So great! Had a really good time watching it.
Love to see how these elite players calculate each shot extremely carefully for a perfect shot. A lot of planning and calculating.....thumbs up
Simply Epic Ian Poulter. Birdies when he’s got to have them! A true LEGEND
I have to say as an American and huge Ryder Cup Fanatic Ian Poulter has always been a nemesis. I’ve come to love him over the years and greatly appreciate his match play accomplishments. Seeing his interviews through the LIV stuff and now on this channel, I absolutely love the dude. What a player when he’s under the pressure. Also, damn what a tight a** course to play!!
Great entertainment!  Ian was a hoot.
Yes, se were entertained😊
great game guys
That was by far the most entertaining golf video I have ever seen. Thank you Rick and Ian.
Funniest video yet. Ian’s laughter when you hit the tree on the 17th was the best. You two had me in stitches the whole video 😂
Welcome to the driving Range on the first Hole.
The best specially with Ia  Thanksn.
Rick. Another great video mate. You really make my golf look really good 👍🏽 so for that I thank you dearly 😂
Anyone else hear Baldrick when Ian is talking?
What a lovely match gentlemen!  Rick, I've quite enjoyed all of your 10 shot challenges to date, but this is my favorite by far. What a gem Ian is, to have very graciously given us all of his shot thoughts on every swing!  My thoughts right now, and I'm sure they're shared by quite a lot of others who have watched this match, is that brother Ian is THE kind of golfer everyone would love to play a round with.  Well done gents on a very entertaining match. Best to you both. Press on and play well!  Thanks much!
We should have a counter for when ever Rick says “right” 😅.   Well played by both.
Ian and Rick are in incredible together. Ian’s such a fun guy to watch and his humour and laughing hard and facial expressions are priceless. Rick and him are special together both are exceptionally talented and gave us all true joy … this could be my top Rick video now. I will watch again!
Loved every minute! Ian Poulter is my new favorite Pro! What class!
I never comment on videos or feel overly inspired to give an opinion. But this is one of the best instructional videos for any low to mid 80-90 golfer. I don’t think it’s as beneficial for the avg armature who doesn’t grasp all the dynamics of their swing. I think it’s more of a resource for those golfers who can semi accurately visualize, predict, anticipate, and understand the potential errors they’re willing and able to work from when shit hits the fan.   Personally, I am a high 80s to low 90s shooter. Came across this late at night before I was about to play a D1 collegiate course designed by the Great Jack. To say I was intimidated is a pitiful understatement. Though watching Mr. Poulter exemplify his own way of being creative and elastic with the way he looks at his problems on the course changed my perspective of everything. I turned my round into a PR of 82 and haven’t seen a single round within 4 strokes of 90 since.   I hope everyone finds value in this episode
That guy Poulter is the worst pro golfer ive seen on the channel by far.
Enjoyed the conversations, but boy you can tell Ian has lost a step.  Playing his home course, pretty weak showing across the board .
Putting
I just start watching for 5 minutes and I am already cracking up
This is so much fun. You should play nice and easy for the first 3 holes. Let them worry about winning and birdies. Make them feel that a par won't be good enough.
The absolute BEST "Can I beat a tour pro" video yet!   Ian Poulter is a class act and so entertaining.  He gave the best insight into how a tour pro approaches the game shot by shot so far on the channel.  I have always liked Poulter and after this how could anyone not? Mr. Shiels, keep it up!
This was one of the more fun challenges....keep it up 😊
Rick a need a new driver . Bought a cobra speedzone which struggled with , so went and bought a rbz which has  defo makes me cry lol send me new one of your preference and I will video using and see if works for me .  Both drivers I mentioned are off 10.5 loft . Hitting both low and chunky . HELP NEEDED m8
Pure classy . Love the content
I gotta say, this video has doubled the already high amount of money I would pay to play a round with Ian Poulter. Dude is a gem
When you get stressed or nervous your tendency is to rotate your wrists open in the back-swing and flip everything closed in the downswing. Time it right and you have a slight draw - miss the timing and it's a flare right or one of your super-hooks.
Fantastic video Rick. IP is amazing
Absolutely class video that gents
I love how rick gets his fades are two yard draws 😅
When Ian hangs up his sticks someone better hire him to call golf on tv!!
Ian Poulter is a pretty cool guy. Nice job Rick really fun to watch.
i am poultry
Rick, I hope you appreciate playing with Ian was like playing with a Tour Caddie who was giving you tour level advice while trying to beat as much as when he was winning nail biting Ryder Cup matches. Nicest Pro ever.
Really a fun match to watch!  The cream rises to the top again! Rick S - 0, Pro guests - 5. C'mon Rick!
That course looks to be a bucket  list course. Absolutely a beautiful course
This was such a fun video. So many great moments.
Absolute legend Ian Poulter, brilliant to hear his thought process behind his shots. More of the same Rick 👊🏻
I am such a HUGE Ian Poulter fan now!
Having unfollowed Poults because his social media became a bore after leaving for LIV, it’s great to see him back with his cheeky charm. He has to be  a Ryder Cup Captain, no one is more deserving.
Cool video But Rick quit saying cut shot, I’ve watched them all and have never seen you intentionally cut a ball yet!!
Been busy at work so not had the time to watch until now, best 10 shot challenge yet, the banter and the shots and the realism, everyone takes a break and gets back to it and doesn't quite meet expectations but thats what made it more relatable. Was this the course where you played Mr. Finch and knocked that wedge to like 2ft from the trees on the 18th? I'd personally like to see you play Tyrrell Hatton, another Englishman but a more honest and openess about the frustrations of golf... may be a 18 rated 10 shot challenge due to language, but its relatable 😂⛳️🏌‍♂️
I've never been able to stand Poulter until this video. Now, I'd like to play a round of golf with him.
That was fun to watch
What a top bloke - new favourite golfer
EPIC the best one yet  Ian Poulter what a genuinely nice feller loved it ❤
EPIC the best one yet  Ian Poulter what a genuinely nice feller loved it ❤
A hugely misunderstood, and insanely genuine person. He seems like such a real friend. Always game to have a good laugh, always prepped for some sporty competition, and always so blatantly honest with his words. Huge respect for Ian with everything going on lately. He has truly become one of my favorite golfers. Thanks for the opportunity to watch this Rick. Best..
That was so great to watch.   The difference between the pro golfers is there ability to produce the clutch shots when they need to.  You could just tell it all got serious with a few holes to play, and he just nailed it. Birdie to win.  Loved watching it, great content and Ian Poulter is very, very cool. 👏
Great video👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Great challenge Rick and what a great guy Ian Poulter is, can’t wait for the next one!
Ian Poulter is the man.
Poulter a real character 👌
It just confirms what we all knew,Ian’s a good egg,great video
Ian is thinking so much. I personally perform horribly when I overthink like that. But amazing to see how far it has brought him and what his though processes are.  Awesome vid Rick!
Best one yet Rick. Ian also class on this
One of the best golf videos on YouTube! No questions about it!
Is the 5 up match play challenge next?
What a video. Poult's insight into every shot was class and he comes across like a class bloke. Best video I've watched in ages 👍👍
Great episode. I know it’s been said ad nauseum, but it was great to hear Ian’s running commentary on his club selection and why, given the shot conditions. There’s a reason he’s Ian Poulter, and by comparison, I’m a 12 handicap nobody. 🤣🤣
Tough day but James is some player!!
To me this is hands down the best series on YT. The conversations, comments and ability to see the pros in a casual atmosphere doing what they love is so entertaining. Thank you for the work you guys put into these.
Such a great video, love all the chat around shot thoughts. Looked like a ridiculously tight/hard course. Ian sounds like a GC.
Ian Poulter just became one of my favorite golfers.  What a great guy!
Poults is total class in my view. Miss him on DP/PGA tour - class act. Loved hearing him talk through his thought process each time. Good video Rick
Today I use pitchin wedge and 9 iron and hit soft chip/pitch shots instead using 52,56,60 wedges and hitting hard, what amazing improve my game,  I think I got this idea from this video. ❤❤❤
It’s clear from the beginning Ian is really looking forward to the match and he clearly respects Rick even knowing he’s not a tour pro and this is backed up by telling his son that the match will be tighter than you.
More adverts needed….
What an epic video.  I was completely hooked and watched every minute with a smile on my face. Unlucky Rick, and what a top guy and player Poults is 👏👏
Brilliant 👍🏼Best guest ever 👊🏼
That was honestly the funniest one I’ve seen. The banter was hilarious. It was like two mates taking the mick. Loved it
Brilliant vid fellas,Poulter is such a legend
If you crossed a professional golfer, an older brother who rags on you mercilessly, and John Cleese from Monty Python, I imagine you’d get something pretty close to Ian Poulter.
Amazing video but please stop saying damn Rick
That has to be one of the funniest most entertaining videos you have done to date , it unfortunately surpasses you and Guy having a moment when he gets the eagle. Some of the golf played was incredible with a little dog meat thrown in. It had me in stitches throroughly good viewing I would recommend anyone watching this. Well done to all involved including the behind the scenes personnel. Well Done brilliant.
1:16:20 - Rick, three holes away, waist deep in ferns, at the bottom of a chasm so deep he needs a ladder to get out:   “It’s not actually that bad...”
Thanks to both of you for doing that. Great video and so informative
Love the game, love the competetion. Thouroughly enjoyed this epic. Thanks Fella's.
Golf pro are just on another level
Ian poulter is one of my heros, what a legend and gent. My dream to play golf with him. Well done rick
Cool to see you play with Ian!!! He bought one of our puppies from a litter we had I hope the little guy is doing well we love those little Dogs so much amd we so happy to see one of them go to such a great family!!
what a great video and what a great guy Ian is, loved it ❤
Too many adverts
two of those shots, remind me of victor Dubuisson..poulter
At about 23:00, Rick commented that Ian dropped one!😮😂
Does it make it more intriguing tv that Rick is actually not a good golfer or you get annoyed watching him struggle?
Rick, I have been watching you for years. Your natural shot is a draw bordering on a hook. Pin high for 1, down in 5, welcome to my world.  It's great to hear Ian's thoughts before every shot.  Also, Ian's organisation, wiping his club before and after every shot.  That is probably the best 1 hour and 56 minutes that I have ever watched on YouTube.  A beautiful golf course and a terrific guest.  You must arrange a rematch.
rick the provisional shiels 😂😂
I think Ian Poulter is now my favorite golfer. What a great guy and very talented! I feel like I can relate to him. Respectful too.
Their bad game is my never game.
I am absolutely an Ian Poulter fan now. Classy guy. I want to go play a round with him now! Lol
No you can't because you are really bad.
Imagine a TW episode
I've learn a lot.... great!!! Just love Ian...
Did you seriously charge me £70 a lesson ??  🤣
The video ended with an open invitation. Can’t wait to see Ian on the channel again, or sponsoring the H.I.T channel with a contribution. Well done on this fabulous content and for the cheeky edits ❤
I see now why Ian is so popular, what a great guy and a great video
What entertainment and it was such a treat hearing Ian’s thought process on each shot. What a great guy👍😀
Such a good video.. Ian Poulter seems very down to earth and listening to him talk through his thought process was amazing and something rarely heard.. When is he coming back for the rematch.?
That was a great watch! Ian’s detailed descriptions on course management were so insightful. Thanks, Rick!
That's what some major entertainment,  good job, that course is so narrow it would cost me a fortune in golf balls
Wow what a round to watch. I actually can,t play for 3 months due to an operation 😢 so watching you play these challenges is great.
Lost for words, just fantastic, Ian is a true Gentleman
Great insight into Ian's thought process. Really entertaining. Annoying as hell to watch Rick Sheils play golf. He thinks he's a player and he's not.
Great video! Poults is a gem! One of your best videos. Get him back soon!
Great video and proper gentleman Ian Poulter
Ian is a class act, he can come off as a bit arrogant yet it is not arrogance, it is confidence. Great time and I really thought Rick might have taken this one! Snatched from victory by a living Golf legend.
the best episode!
Incredible video. Ian Poulter’s guidance and commentary were the best. What a gem.
1st hole, "bit too much of a draw". Erm, that is a fancy word for a hook Richard lol
great match, awesome to watch.
the first 5 minutes of this is amazing... 🤣
Brilliant match, one of the best, great to hear the thoughts behind each shot 👏👏👏
Rick is actually just god awful
I find myself reacting like Poulter when I play with a buddy who couldn’t find sand at a beach.  His reaction to some of the stuff Rick says cracks me up.  I feel his pain listening to the crazy.
I had to like this video from the 1st tee, just from Ian's banter I can tell this is gonna be a great video! 😂 Seems like a right laugh 👍
These are so great to watch, keep them coming rick
Great to see a pro at work- Poults is an awesome bloke!
Epic round of golf……so much fun to watch 👏
you keep saying Damn like a yank 🤣😂
In a word, phenomenal!
Poults laugh was like Muttley hahaha. Many a C bombs could've been dropped at that point
What an exquisite track. Teaches very accurate driving! The 2nd shots by both of you on 18 were absolute darts!
Amazing video. Ian is such a class act and watching him talk through each shot, helping you, was great. Bring him on more! We want more Ian!
Poulter is an absolute gent and even bigger legend. His videos with yourself and Tubes are brilliant.  Great work getting him on your channel, it's been great watching it.  When are you playing Bullard tho?? 😅😅
Amazing watch poults is genuinely such a nice guy! Loved watching this one!
Rick's problem is that he knows too much about the game of golf :D
Ian is just a top guy and for me he will be always an Ryder cup hero ⛳️💪🏼 cheers from Germany 🇩🇪
Up until now, I’ve never been the biggest fan of Poulter. But I must say he is absolute class here. Great match.
Ian showed just enough casual play early...but then that match play dogg kicked in💯! Best show yet🏌🏾‍♂️
Great video, Ian is a legend
Rick, I think you're opening the clubface too soon or too actively in the takeaway which then on the downswing forces you to close it aggressively, at least how it looks to me (not that you probably care lol)
What an awesome video! Ian was a great guest and that finish almost felt scripted.. Super!!
This was such a great video, and an epic final hole! Really interesting to hear how he sizes up each shot
I really enjoyed this one Rick. What a guy Ian is..... legend.
This man should not give golf advice 😂
The best one till now....Rick will have to do wonders to better this video Ian ..what a gentleman...
The postman always delivers What a great game that was Well played Rick
So great to see and hear the pro’s what a gentleman Ian is. Loved it.🇦🇺
Wonderful watch gents..👌🏽👌🏽
there was no way the King of the Ryder cup was going to lose to a youtube golfer.
Sound quality has decreased unfortunately. Not really enjoyable to listen to with headphones.
I think i speak for everyone when i say. Where are the sasuage roll reviews?
That music coming in at 18:24 is just pure bliss.
Keep them coming!!
Another brilliant one
An absolute gem of an episode!
Yep , best one yet by a long shot 👏
You need to play Jimmy Bullard lol
You can literally see the moment Ian is like, "okay, time to turn it on!"
Awesome video listening to poults plotting way round course and some awesome shots
Man, that was fun to watch!
Wow
Awesome match against one of my fav pro players. Throughly enjoyed that
Would be great to challenge Cam Smith while he is in England.
Amazing video Rick. Your content keeps on delivering...just like Ian! One of your best vids, such an enjoyable watch.
I knew he was going to beat you all the way through.  All those Ryder Cup wins, he had you in his pocket.  One of your best though - good entertainment, thanks!
He by far has been one of my favorite pros! This has been great.
I wish Poults played that shitty in the Ryder Cup 😂
Ian P is now one of my favourite golfers. He just seems like such a decent human!!!! And I loved his competitiveness 😂
TREES 🌲 TREES 🌲 TREES 🌲 !!!!!! Talk about a TIGHT driving golf course 😯 One of your best, entertaining challenges 🏌️‍♂️⛳️ Well done gentleman…Congratulations Ian
Whoa!!! That 2nd shot of Rick's on the last hole was so close.!!!....what a shot!!!...if he had just ever so slightly less spin and it was in...the putt was lovely too...really fun and informative !!!
The best video by far…. I have not been a big Poulter fan, but after watching this, I’ve changed my mind! Great stuff
Ian seems so cool!! and what a baller
This is the most entertaining episode I've seen... Ian Poulter is an absolute legend 🙌
you disqualified yourself when you asked what club he hit
I agree with rick, hearing the self dialogue is really nice. I always wondered what kind of things golfers of this caliber think pre-address
I really like Ian.
What a crackin top man Ian Poulter is . Great fun !
Great guest. The ads were absolutely ruthless throughout though. I'm exhausted from them.
"POULT" Is truly a LEGEND OF GOLF! Loved the finish guys!
Fascinating
He is no longer a legend , get golfers who didnt sell out to LIV
ian's the best
Soooo Gooood!
YES!! Very entertaining. Ian is sooo nice and entertaining to watch.
Perfectly synchronized at 1:00:22 😂
Awesome video , everything about it was great , the course , the company, the golf .  Just needed the sublime commentary of the late great Peter Allis .
This full rounds with tour pros are the best YouTube golf content. Always thought the Foreplay Boys round with Kisner was the best...until this one. What an incredible job by Poulter. So fascinating to see his level of focus and detail for the entire round, all while coaching Rick through every shot.
does anyone else just hear Tony Robinson when Ian talks? Boldrick!
Great video mate!
I had the whole of the UK on the right was a great one liner 😂
I’m now an Ian Poulter fan. I’ll be rooting for him. Shiels, too many commercials.
The thought process from Poulter is incredible
This was a great video concept. Let's do it again!!!
Rick .."just going to hit a little fade"  = Guaranteed draw every time :) Really awesome video "Poults" was amazing
Rick, that was great to watch
I loved this video.  What a great guy Ian Pouter is, and my perception of him has changed dramatically.
Ian is very personable....nice round
I play once a month and i whole heartedly believe id beat rick id even give him 5 shots😂😂
Haha I will watch Liv just to cheer Ian on after that.... what an incredible video
These 18 hole matches you do with the pros are my favorite YouTube golf videos. Easily.
Rick this was a fantastic episode, super fun to watch and great to listen and see how a tour pro thinks and  approaches different scenarios and challenges around the course.  Loved the questions you asked Ian as he was approaching different shots.  I think I'll watch the whole show again with a few beers.  cheers!!
Best one yet!
Ian was Terrific, great Guest.
What a great video. This is a side of Mr. Ian Poulter I’ve not seen before. He is a true gentleman and I am now a fan of his. !!
Ian is a G
I’m a big fan of Ian I love his focus and bulldog determination!
Best vid yet. Ian poulter seems a true gentleman and I honestly think he honestly enjoyed that. It must also be very hard to play against these famous professionals so good on u Rick
Course management was the difference there. That hero shot double was the difference in the end. Pitch out and make a bogie and it's a tie, maybe make a par and win.
Yeah got to agree with most people on here mate, probably best guest pro you have had. Very entertaining.
Number of adverts on this are wild
Ian is awesome. Great mix of competitive but keeping it light and funny!
What a great video, poulter simply a class act. Proper gentleman, love hearing his thought process throughout the round. 👍
Great video Rick
Genuinely loved that. I'm not a fan of the longer format videos, particularly with so many piggin adverts, but Poults was absolutely brilliant value throughout. His craic was good, but he was so supportive and full of advice and open about thought processes. Just class, and a proper gentleman!  Even better, spotted myself and  3 mates on one of the greens during a flyover. I remember seeing the drone above us as we were approaching our balls. 😂
Always nice to see you play like me sometimes Rick, great video
I think the pga has always created this narrative that Ian is the villain but he was nothing but funny, charismatic, and charming in the video
Ian Poulter, what a legend.... Great video... The level of thought process is on another planet!
That was amazing video.  More plz
Best one yet, really enjoyed this video
Ian needs to do more of this love it.
stunningly good entertainment. The best Rick Shiels video to date, I just couldnt stop watching...
Brilliant
I was not expecting Ian Poulter to be such a bloody gent!
Looks like a very difficult course but what a match. Really enjoyed. Rick seems to start badly but showed a really good golf game when he settled.
That was truly the most enjoyable golf video I've watched.  Ian was so genuine and generous with his golf thoughts. Thanks and I can't wait until Henrick...😂
Love the way Ian taljs to camera!,  He's a natural.!
That’s not poulter. That’s Rob Green and I won’t be hearing anything else
These two are proper genuine! A great duo, like that Ian doesn't have a caddy in tuo!
What a humble and nice guy Ian Poulter is! The way he enjoyed the round with Rick has made me an even bigger fan of his!!! An absolute epic video! Watching these 2 guys having fun playing golf was the most entertaining thing I have seen in ages !!  Thanks Rick, thanks Ian 🙏
Great stuff - really enjoyed that
Oh yes Rick defo the best challenge yet - always thought Ian pouter was a bit aloof - not any more, great bloke to go around with!
Why does Rick say damn in an American accent?😂
Great content but the sheer number of ads is massively annoying
For every time Rick say "right" take a shot.
Absolutely hilarious video, love the bits where poulter was making faces to the camera. He is definitely naturally funny. Keep up the great work rickie
one of the best videos ever Ian is Awesome Rick is fantastic great great video
Thanks for the sound fix  now it’s 100% your best episode ⛳️👍
Best one of these yet. Loved the banter and you can tell Ian is having a fun time, all very genuine!
Hi Rick. You had an amazing chipping lesson (that revolutionised my game) but I don’t see you using anything learned at all. Why is that?
Had the privilege to meet Ian there at a BMW day some years ago. He was as good then as he is here. I qualified and he signed my card. Still have the card and a photo of he and i framed. He is a top bloke, complete gentleman
Great round Rick - superb to hear Ian Poulter's thought process on shots, next level type stuff!
As an American golfer who has religiously watched the Ryder Cup since taking up golf in the 1970’s, I’ve alway “hated” Ian Poulter - until now.  This was one of my favorite Rick Shiels videos that completely changed my attitude toward Ian. Good match.  Good fun.  Way to go Rick and Ian!
Perhaps my favourite one. Ian is such a fine human being. What a great watch, cheers Rick. As always 🤘
WOW! this was so entertaining and enjoyable to watch, Ian was hilarious, what a top bloke 👍🏼
Brilliant vid , Poults was awesome . No way could I play there without a chainsaw!! 😂
Great work guys!
Great video
Throwing it out there. I reckon jimmy bullard puts Rick shiels through his paces 😏
Some folk have said Ian is a divisive character. I never understood that, I've always really liked him and his personality. What great banter and fun along with the openness and solid advice throughout. Top stuff.
Brilliant episode
Great vid Rick been watching for 8 years it’s mad how far you’ve come
Poults.  Legend.
This was class
Best video yet. I Was always unsure about Ian Poulter but not anymore. What a great guy and sport he was. Oh, and well played Rick.
Poulter was surprisingly humble and kind.
How many ads do you need 😢
What a top bloke and so funny 👏🏼👏🏼 the best 10 shot challenge guest so far
Loved the match, Ian was so humble and helpful to Rick, special thanks to Ian and I hope people start accepting LIV, that course looked so bloody narrow!
Amazing ⛳️😍 Go to Sweden and challange Stenson at Barsebäck.
What a round of golf, Mr Poulter is just brilliant and it was fantastic viewing.
Trop de pub. Au revoir.
Rick ,Ian poulter what a lovely guy, loved his thoughts on playing his shots, always loved him and Ryder mate Justin rose great team mates .perhapes you could play Justin Rick he's agree guy and vernominal player great game guys 👍
Amazing. Stenson next please! 🙌🏻
Poulter played shipping shot competitions as a kid.. I played horse at playgrounds with graffiti and baskets with no nets. We obviously grew up in different tax brackets 😂
Very entertaining! 🎉
Loved how much Ian talked through his mindset on each shot
Usually the word "epic" is overused...but this match was....EPIC!  Great fun and great video flow.  We got to see the pre-shot routines and hear the thought process without being boring.  Thanks guys, especially AV crew for putting together an overall enjoyable video.
Honestly enjoyed every bit of this, "Poults" was outstanding!
You did a 10 shot challenge with Sir Nick Faldo too but you always leave him out!
Dang your draw with your driver just wasn't there on the front. I'm only half way through.
So very enjoyable, thanks for this one Rick and Ian!
What genuinely nice guy Poults is, absolutely loved this video
I'd love to see an Ian Poulter channel, what a great guest!
The best ever!!!
the 18th...  What a hole
Great game, great course, what a finish ! Lovely laugh on 17'th :D ! Thank's a lot for sharing that golfy moment
I became a fan of Ian after the Netflix show..... but now I'm a Huge fan.
That was brilliant  Ian Poulter was a really good sport 👏 👍
What a couple of second shots. Ricks lucky deflection, Poults glory 3 wood !!
Ian is so much fun.  Best 10 shot vid yet.
U should try weed or something to take the edge off for the starts 😂
This course is absolutely beautiful.
I love Ian suggesting on 7 a soft open 3 wood slice swing!   😂
I played Golf with Mr Poulter in the HSBC pro Am in Shanghai and I can only say he is an absolute star helping an old 19 handicap golfer to my best ever round 😊
Really enjoyable to watch.. Funny, entertaining and sat here watching it  frustrating as hell, I can only dream of hitting it straight, hitting it as far and having an opportunity to meet the greats of the game...  Thanks for doing the videos and thanks @IanPoulter for giving your time for our entertainment.. Like and subscribed looking forward to the other videos.. Thanks both
Ian is greatness
Poulter has been and always will be a legend great entertainment and taught process is mind blown!!! Great video
Great match! I've always liked Ian as a player, but this video increased my respect for him. What a generous competitor. He offered encouragement, advice, and praise to his opponent. Love to see it!
Great match
WHAT A GEM, MASTERPIECE, THIS IS PURE CINEMA
This video will be watched for years after posting!  Ian is a legend and displayed on YouTube by the best Rick.  Thank you so much for this video guys!  Great match!
Ian: I give you a 1 in 20 odd to make that hook shot around the trees... Rick: I got this *Hits ball almost OB and makes double after lucky find* XDDD
This might be one of my favorite Rick Shiels videos full stop. Ian was so much fun
Ian Is an amazing entertaining golfer.  Please do more of these with Ian.  He is awesome :)
This is the kind of course i would like to see in huge collaborations instead of wide open resort style.
Great insight and awtch
Actually made me more of a fan of Poulter after watching the video.  My favorite out of the series so far.
Absolutely brilliant
soooo freakin good.....Ian's the best
Love the video, Ian is truly spectacular and if I could play with any living pro would have to pick him. Fun, down to earth great guy. Keep up the great content !
This was my favorite one of these.  Fun watch!
Anyone else notice the sneaky editing around 1:31 ?  When Ian is trying an escape out of the trees, there's clearly a new divot beside the ball which wasn't there when he was describing the shot. He must've had another go!😅😅
Rick, Ian was playing you all day😂😂😂, that was some fun, Ian is a class act, game face on for the 18, well done lads👏👏👏
Could see Rick was a bit nervous at the start, but he quickly settled as a result of Poulter's easy going manner - enjoyed this one.
Ian is awesome. So polite and gentlemanly and low key snuck inside Rick’s head on 16
That was unreal! What a cool video and match 🔥
Best ive watched on YouTube,  format was spot on ! What a great game
What a top bloke
Fantastic vlog. Mr Poulter is a true great and a gentleman to boot, absolutely loved it.
This course looks incredibly intimidating
fun video to watch. Poults is an all timer!!!!
Watching his thought process for every shot, and all the things he's considering, and the accuracy of the yardage for each one, just shows that we are are all miles off it.
We need Ian on again he's brilliant
Was looking forward to this one, Poults is a favorite for how he is on and off the course.  haven't seen anyone do more to be present and support his family and engage them in his life.  Always here for the Good Dad content.
1:16:20 I think I saw Ray Mears down there.
Ok. So I was little sceptical and slightly annoyed at the prospect of a 1hr 55 min video. But I thoroughly enjoyed that. Brilliant 👌🏻
Ads on every hole
This is the best learning lesson for me 🙂
Hey Rick Hole 14 Par5  Ians’ Tee shot is marked as his second- you could correct that.  Great video great content!
Great video. Too many ads tho
The best one yet!!! Thanks Rick and Ian!!!
Good Vid Rick....Had the honour of playing both Dukes and Duchess - Great Courses!!!
Incredible
Assumed the Rick guy would be better
Poults seems like a great guy. And what a shooter.
By far the greatest guest you’ve had on for these tour pro challenges. Fingers crossed Poulter is on his way to Rome in a little over 2 months!
Absolutely love your content, Rick. This one was right up there with the best you've ever done, due in no small part to Ian's engagement, and general sense of approachability. If you had just left the big stick in the bag after the first few errant tee shots, you might have had this one! Looking forward to the next video! Cheers!
this was one of the best videos ever Rick. Loved it
What a great video. Poulter looks like a genuine class act. 👍👍
Brilliant 10 hole challenge  thought you'd thrown it away over them first holes and then thought you'd won with a couple left. Great entertainment
Ian was absolutely top class, hard luck there Rick what a video.
That was awesome. Enjoyed every minute. Ian was so generous with his advice and praise and came across as a really great guy.
It felt like he took it easy on you, but he turned it up when you did, and was not going to lose. I don't think any pro likes to lose, and he is no exception. Really cool guy.
Glad Rick played some great shots on 18
I've got tears of joy and enthusiasm about this brilliant matchplay. This is an example of the true spirit of golf. Rick and Ian have understood what this game really is !!! Thank you so much and keep in with your great channel😄😍🏌️😎
These greens look BEAUTIFUL
This is my favorite video you have ever done. Also your best ever guest. I think everyone watching this learnt something new
Absolutely loved this. Ian was your best guest yet. He seemed to truly enjoy being there. He wanted the best for Rick and helped you every chance he could.   You both played well. It’s epic the way it climaxed on the 18th hole with you both hitting some of yourourur best shots of the day and Rick nearly pulling off a miracle super long putt. And then Ian draining a “no gimme “ putt.   Wow, I can’t wait to see how you try and top this one.  Cheers !
Great video guys. Poults class act as usual
This is good telly
Brilliant 🙌⛳️
This is the best one yet!!! Ian was phenomenal with his content and banter. Keep up the great work
When is the Rick Shiels Vs. Tiger Woods at Augusta video coming? 😉
Great stuff 👏👏
Brilliant!!!!   Love these 10 shot challenge video's....Would be amazing if Tour Pro could do a 2/3 minute 'whats in the bag' before first tee...??
Lovely. Thanks for making this it was sooooooo entertaining. Ian was a star.
as always, any candid access to tour players is good to see. Ian is a good sport!
Best Golf challenge video ever - loved it! Thank you Mr Poulter - legend!
By far the best video I’ve watched, what a legend Poults has to be a Ryder cup captain
Love this - Poults is such a legend - so interesting to hear you he naturally works out a shot and the explanation behind the reasoning. Nice work Rick, great guest.
This is 10/10 quality content
What a great video, Ian was a fantastic guest. Like watching  a super computer go through its programming. The thought process on every shot and even yours Rick was a great share 👍
He switch on last few holes😂
From now on I start using a hand towel on the green😅😅😅
What a great Golfcourse that is:-)
That was so epic. Loved every minute
Best 10 shot challenge you have done.  What a great bloke & true gentleman Ian Poulter is👏👏😊
Brilliant Rick - Poulter was superb - best video yet!
Great video. Really enjoyed it. What a great guy poulter is.
Absolute unreal video with the postman. Always loved poults great character of the game . I never realised how much the pros go in depth with each shot.
Love this.
It’s amazing what a competitive soul Ian is.  You can almost pinpoint the moment he decides.  Amazing.
This course looks absolutely terrifying.
15 minutes 1 hole😂
Rick I have subscribed from the start . This is the best video you have ever released . Superb
I thought for a moment i was going to have to watch 1 hour and 55 mins just to see Rick get off the first Tee
Sorry Rick but  in my opinion for what its worth you are overthinking so many of your shots, and looking at Poulters reactions i think he feels the same. 2hy not just pick a spot and stand up and hit it instead of trying to fade or draw your shots.
Rick. Stupid course management. Tightest course in UK and you hit driver off every tee..
What a match and what a legend Ian is. Easily the most entertaining match I have seen you play. Bring on Stenson!!
I treely enjoyed that!
Putter to the ankle is almost as bad as stepping on a Lego 😂
Ian Poulter what an amazing guy he was so informative brilliant video thanks Rick
I now love Ian poulter😂❤
Well the answer is NO 😂😂😂.     Rick you play everyday, I love your channel but really. I only play occasionally with my 25 year old set of titlest and I would fancy my chances of beating you.                          I have to congratulate you on your success rather than your game of golf 😂😂😂
Fantastic video, really enjoyed the way Ian came over on cam. One of the best challenges for sure.   However, I can’t be the only one who really hates the positioning of the mid roll ads. We all know why ads are there and what they do, but the number of times they start just as the player is over the shot, then when the video restarts, the shot has been taken is nuts. If it restarted at the same point it stopped it wouldn’t be so bad, but it’s always a few seconds late. So you don’t see the actual shot!
Best one yet! 👍👍👍👏👏👏👌👌👌
Poultry was such a joy on this.
Ian was an absolute gentleman in this. The best guest ever in my opinion. Real shame we can’t see you in the Open
Wow that was phenomenal Sir Ian Poulter what a Legend and Ricky boy great effort to stay in the fight down the stretch another awesome show thank you........
Ian Poulter is just such a great character!
So good to hear his thought process as he plays I have learned a lot   Great video
That was excellent Rick. Ian was a fantastic guest and it was definetely full of entertainment and drama 😂
Quality video that, Poults is marmite but his commentary on his shots was unbelievable 👏👏👏👏
rick king of cringe
The maniacal laugh out of Poulter at 1:43:00 makes the entire video for me 😂😂😂
Amazing knowledge and insight to take away, what a fantastic guy IP is. best guest ever.
In the Interpretations on the Rules, you'll see that phrases implying doubt are good enough (e.g. "I'm going to play another just in case"). But whatever you say, it must be obvious that your intent is to hit a provisional ball. You are not, however, obliged to look for your original ball if you don’t want to, but you can’t actually stop your opponent or anyone else from looking, even if most golfers would consider it good etiquette to not go looking for a ball if someone has clearly stated their desire to abandon it. But if that does happen and the ball is found, you will have to proceed using that ball even if you had declared it to be lost, as the Rules do not allow you to declare a ball lost!
Clean your clubs Rick!!!!!!!!!!
Rick would be a lot more consistent if he didn’t hinge his wrist instantly at the start of his swing specially with his driver
Throughly entertaining, hearing the thought process from Ian Poulter is gold.
I don’t give a rats ass what anyone says about liv sellouts, Ian is a stand up guy and is a amazing guy on this channel. What an amazing video
At least I'm at a point in my game where I'm usually having to worry about spin around the greens as well. Either spinning 60 yards left, 57 yards right, or 80 yards too short.
What an amazing guest Ian is - Ryder Cup hero, all round nice guy, and such a golfer in those big moments.
Good vid. Pity about the clipping in the audio, as if the mics were too close to their mouths, particularly Poulter's
Absolutely loved it, proper top man Ian is, the back 9 was some tremendous golf 👏👏👏👏👏
Now this was entertainment!! What a legend poulter is!
More great content. BUT you tube seems to have ramped up the amount of ad breaks. It really getting off putting. I know they want to force us to pay £12 a month! Such a shame.  Absolutely love your content Rick
Rick,  butter cut... shut down pull draw  🤣
This is literally your best video yet. What an absolute legend Ian Poulter is !
Absolutely loves this.  Poulter is a legend.   Great video as per!
Can we have more of Ian, honestly could watch him all day. Fantastic golfer with great sense of humour
Congratulations Rick.  One of the best yet.  Massive credit to Ian Poulter too.  His candidness in the interview and during this match was phenomenal and the postman once again delivered.
My favorite thing about this video is that Ian is such a cheeky shit talker but also so incredibly helpful with ideas/shot choices and encouraging to Rick. Great video.
Despite the LIV issues and his social media antagonizing, he was such a great guy on this episode. Funny, genuine, and fun to play with I'm sure! It's things like this that unites golf again. I wasn't ever a LIV supporter or hater (Dustin remains as one of my favorite current players), but politic bs of pro golf aside, it's great to see these professionals come out and have some fun. I can't wait to see who you eventually have lined up next, someday it'll be Tiger!
Always thought Ian Poulter would be a great guy.  This video cemented that thought.  His commentary on his own shots was great.  Also was a great caddy for Rick.  One of my favorite RS videos.
Sadly, always loved Ian but he's sold out by joining the LIV tour. Seems these Saudi players now ALL have blood on their hands. :(
IYKYK Petes perfect seven-iron pitch probably saved the perfect match! followed by the greatest 60 degree shot on the channel. Hole 18 on this course makes for the best finales!!!
Great video. I have always loved Ian's personality.
57:04 That is a Priceless Poulter Prediction 😂😂😂
An incredible video Rick. Brilliant edits with terrific camera work, made for an even better round of golf. Ryder Cup is what got me into golf, and Ian Poulter is one of my favorite players. Well done. Keep up the amazing work. By the way, that course was very cool, looks a lot like the forestry lined tracks we have in the Midwest United States.
After watching this, I think I have a new favorite golfer.
I’ve always been a fan of Ian Poulter and this along with the podcast cemented him for me as one of my all time favorites. Very entertaining to watch!
I thoroughly enjoyed watching this
more of this
Ian is a stud. It's also refreshing as a player to see that even professionals struggle and scramble and have terrible tee shots.  Goes to show what a hard and beautiful game golf is!
I think ive enjoyed this one the most.
All time great YouTube match 💰💰💰💰
Ian is the best  Best guest out of a field of greats. Total pleasure - felt like I was playing along in the group
Just Brilliant
This is more entertaining than almost all professional golf, outside the majors.  Top notch sir, well done!
Really enjoyed the video, you guys were great together.
left hand get it into the short stuff
Rick quick from the top...
7:45 looks like a Cog Hill hole.
Awesome to watch. Amazing videoing and editing skills. Great work Rick and team. Ian seems like a legend.
I have never seen Rick want to get on his knees worse.
Ian is wildly misunderstood, to think this guy used to be the least liked on tour is crazy.   Could tell he would be a riot if the cameras weren’t causing him to watch his language. Good video Richard.
Mate stop yelling "fore left" or "fore right".  Just yell fore as loud as you can.  Right and left are meaningless to anyone who might get hit by your errant shot.
Took me four days to watch this video. Amazing 😂 hilarious and insightful. Ian is awesome. Well done Rick
what a great match, amazing effort Rick!
Ian seems to get YouTube golf more than Rick...amazing! "Open face chip slicey 3 wood through the trees......"
I’ve watched a lot of PGA on TV. This was a lot better than any of it.
Nerves were showing.
That was sensational!  The best content you have put out, and all your content is great.  Poulter comes across as such a great guy, his insight was outstanding  Congrats to the whole team.
That was an awesome video, great match. Had Ian sweating thinking he was gonna be the first to fall and he went into beast mode those last three holes. 😂
Really entertaining Rick and Ian.  Super job!
best guest yet lol love it
I have to say, I think that was the best 10 shot challenge of all. If nothing else, for the finish alone.
That's was an unbelievable video
@rickshielspga , I’ve been watching your stuff for a long time and have to say you nailed the is one! Hands down the most entertaining 10 shot challenge you’ve done! They’ve all been great, but Ian was magical on camera and you two produced some seriously good (and hilarious) content. Watching Ian think out loud and work with you on your incredible tree game was wild. He had so much support for you while maintaining his epic level of competitiveness. Such a great episode.
This was great!!!!!
Absolute top man is Ian Poulter. You can tell he’s just a genuine top fella! Great to see his competitive side coming out towards the end. Great video Rick…as always.
Very much enjoyed that Rick, great work from all involved.  Looked like you both had a lot of fun and Ian was absolute class, fantastic hearing him talk his way round the course. I agree with those who'd like to see more of Ian, seemed a great bloke who loves his golf. I really thought you might pip him there Rick but of course he delivered in the end.
What an absolutely awesome match, had everything in there: great shots, bad shots, drama, humour. What more could you want in a golf match? But..........the Postman always delivers!!!!!! Well done Ian.
Best one yet!
@RickShielsPGA your recent 'dayum' phrase is horrible.
What a gent Poulter is! I have had mixed opinions in the past but he comes across as just a really good bloke in both this video and the podcast. Looking forward to the Tiger video... surely coming soon!
Some of those drives look disgustingly narrow between the trees. I would offer so many golf balls up to the golf gods through a round here!
Ian was a fantastic guest on the channel, and he provided some excellent information about shots from different lies
Brilliant
Cracking bogey on the 17th! Ian Poulter, what a legend! His insight into his shot selection was awesome to watch... thanks @rickShieldsPGA, what an awesome video!!!
Another great video, Poults was brilliant. The best 10 shot legend yet! 👍
Absolutely delightful!!  Very cool to listen to Ian's thinking as he chooses clubs and shots.  This is what golf is all about!
Ian seems a real.good fella,iv always been a fan of his
What lense was the second camera man using?
Real good entertainment that
Ian laughing at Rick hitting the @ 1:43 got me
That 18th hole was intense! Absolutely loved it!
Poulter looks talentless compared to previous guests.  Washed up. No wonder he took the money and retired to the exhibition circuit
Spectacular video as always! So entertaining. Has Poults ever missed a putt that has mattered???
That was my favorite 10 shot challenge to date.  Ian was great on Camera, his commentary was outstanding, really have an insight as to how good players think.  I think he also genuinely enjoyed that which added to the enjoyment.
Rick - as a man that’s just finished Dan’s 3 releases book off the back of your video….do you feel yourself using it? I saw a few wimpy putts and a couple of brave release 2/3s in there! I’m about to go practice
Would love to hear some more cart convos
Best one yet!  Epic 18th!
A great match...very well done.
Really entertaining which has a lot to do with the way Ian interacted with you and the camera. Great stuff..
Must endorse others comments what a great guest. The insight Ian give us mere mortals is fantastic.  I really respect he makes great viewing👍👍🏌🏿‍♂️
best youtube golf so far. Ian surely knows what the game is all about : competition and fun.
Ian is such a great guy! Great content!
What a top bloke Ian Poulter is. Best challenge to watch so far.
This was eeeeepic to watch ! Ian is such a nice guy :)
Ian the goat
The best and most  enjoyable 18 holes on YouTube
EPIC!
I thought Rick was supposed to be good at golf
🤮🤮🤮
Ian was an awesome guest! So close coming down to the end. That course looked incredible!
Big fan of Ian poulter! And Rick I love all your content! I’m a big fan of good good good also BUT YOUR CHANNEL WAS THE FIRST I STARTED FOLLOWING AND STILL THE BEST GOLF ON YOUTUBE HANDS DOWN!!
This is great! Love Ian!
Brilliant drama on the 18th
These 10 shot vs a Tour pro vids are really good. I'd sit and have a drink with every Tour pro that has been on this series. They are all genuine good guys and these vids show a great side of them all. Liv, PGA.... whatever. Just world class golf talent all around. I wanna be BFF's with Poulter now. That would have been an insanely fun 18 holes of golf. Well done lads. This vid makes me want to go tee it up RIGHT NOW.
Terrific round well done both of you on a very unforgiving course
Wow, how i enjoy every single video ❤️ my love for golf has taken an extra flight since watching these video’s! Ian was an absolute gentleman! How I would love to see more!!!!  Maybe Rory one day?
Favourite video by a mile!!!
One of your best videos EVER!!!  Ian is awesome on camera!
ip. Fantastic ❤
Ian at 1:43 .. gold 🤣
1:24:28 Dumb and Dumber reference😂😂😂😂Quality!  Who’s idea to put a course in a forrest? That place looks like it will punish wayward shots raw.  1:43:06😂😂😂😂😂 Mutley laugh
🔥
Quality content, loved every minute, well done Rick, look forward to seeing the next pro challenge.
Absolutely brilliant video, considering Poulter was talking and laughing all the way through and seeing the shots for Rick just goes to show how good these tour pros are. Stenson needs to take the challenge, if Rick wins then he’ll never hear the end of it off poulter!! 😂😂
Such a wonderful watch guys!
The postman delivers...Ian is a top bloke.
great video, really enjoyed watching this
Nice preview.  Looks tough 😬🙏
What a shot you did on the 18th Rick!
Great vid, really great golfer and human that poulter.
great fun to watch this....Great guy Ian!!!!
Great guy Ian just wish he had rhat natural ability the big guys have he'd have won multiple comos by now and the odd major. I wonder if Rick has ever contemplated a odyssey chip master I'm not beikg funny they are brilliant for around the green I have one never looed back and I'm nit a bad chipper but there versatile what you can use them for
Came down to the wire! Great episode and Ian is a fantastic guest!
Quite possibly THE BEST Vs video on this channel! Ian was funny engaging and his feedback and dialogue was so good. I had to watch it twice!
I was so excited to watch this, its a long one, but worth every second. Glad you fixed the sync issues, I finished it off today. Love Ian's humour! One, I'll rewatch!
I never really cared for Ian...until this video.  He seems like a very likable guy.
Ian Poulter is an absolute gem .. one of the best Utube golf videos of all time
Wow what a video!  Ian was awesome!  Rick very entertaining video
Is there a more tree-lined course in England ? That was absolutely beautiful, but I would have lost 20 balls !  I loved the way Ian took the mickey  when Rick was playing badly  i.e the first tee, or trying something crazy "i've got it in my locker" but he was also very generous in his advice and his insights into his thought process.  Maybe the worst golfer so far in this 10-under series but  definitely the  most  friendly . And he turned it on at the end when he thought he might lose. Brilliant fun.
Top blokes, what a great vid
Really impressed with Ian Poulter in this video. Encouraging and supportive, funny and enjoying playing golf. Changed my opinion of him somewhat.
Ian Poulter has the new 23 T100 irons... it appears.
Absolutely hillarious best one I’ve watched ever
Ian Poulter seems like such a cool gent
If the tour player started +10 and Rick started level, I think you'd see a really different result.... Rick talks himself into a bad start, I think because he isn't comfortable being -10 and it ruins him mentally..... Great match though!
EPIC VIDEO RICK
Disgraceful amount of ads
The most entertaining round of golf I have seen. Ian’s insight into the thought process behind each shot was a real eye opener
Brilliant Rick 👍🏼 Best one yet
You gotta get Padraig Harrington on next!
IP seems like a really down to earth chap. Awesome video
Nice Rick - a joy to watch
Not sure about the cheesy slow-mo’s.
Too many ads ffs
Love Ian play and attitude, he could have his own channel one day, he also seemed to take it easy until the last few holes and then had his game face on. Magic video.
rick why arent you using the short game technique from your lesson?
Playing this course would bore me rigid. The same trees on every hole. Snooze fest.
Super
I really enjoyed that. Ian is such a nice lad. Iain Leeds Yorkshire. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿
I don't even really like golf... but I had a smile on my face for almost the entire video. Well done!
Love this video, always liked Ian Poulter but watching this, even more so! Great entertainment, every thought process on each shot. So close Rick, maybe next time!
Fabulous Entertainment, hope your Pec bruise heals Soon
What I took away from this video, Ian when playing bad still scores well and Rick "cannot believe" a lot of his shots! LOL!
Poults! 👏👏👏
Best Video yet mate, unbelievable watch !
I absolutely like this format. Ian is such a cool guy. Love it.
rick, get rid of that driver!!!!
For some reason I expected Ian to be cocky and annoying. He ended up being the total opposite. Best guest so far, by far. A totally relaxed gentleman and funny at just the right moments. Ian for president (or RC captain)!
What a shot from the path !!
What a match. Amazing finish. Two absolute gents and great fun to watch. Poults has a new follower, great craic, had me in stitches when your were taking your shots Rick 😂
One of the best episodes! You can really tell he was jelly for your nice shots... And even happier when you missed! You could feel his hunger for the win, amazing after his great career. Chapeau! To both of you, or course
How entertaining was that? Just great to watch and the best PRO you had so far. Really enjoyed Ian P. and his thoughts. More of this please.
their approach shots on that 18th hole were insane
every single one of my second shots would be out of the trees on this course
highly amusing to see Poulter try to rehabilite himself....but for the ryder cup, everyone,well nearly everyone has thought he is an anchor for most of his golfing career.  Enjoy your dosh mate...
As an American I’ve had no choice but to dislike poulter for years. After watching the Netflix special and this video it’s hard not to like the guy. Definitely need a rematch
Poulter seems like a pretty cool guy. I think the media has tried to paint him as a bit of an English dick in the past. Lee Westwood on the other hand seems like a huge prick.
Hilarious @ 1:42:57 😂😂😂😂
That was fun.
You guys should do this again! We need more Ian on the channel!
Poults would NEVER miss that last putt.  Great episode!!
From this video Ian Poulter seems like one of the coolest most genuine people on tour. Definitely going to watch more of this man golf!! Awesome video!
One of the best golf videos you’ll ever see on YouTube.
I think this is probably one of the best if not THE best I’ve seen in a long time! Great video and Ian was PHENOMENAL!! 👍👍
A comment from the States, how can’t you like Ian? Just a pleasure to watch and the thought process, WOW!
Rick,  I loved Ian for his Ryder Cup performances, then I disliked him for leaving to LIV and lost all interest. Watching this video I have now watched it for the fourth time and I have to say, Ian I am a fan of yours again! So open, so refreshing and I find the golf that was on show was class! It's much more boring when it's fairways and greens in reg.  Love the video! Rick, please carry on those challenges!  Well struck 2 Iron ... What a shot!
RSG!!! Can I just say this episode was unreal! Got to run it back soon! Golf chemistry with LP was class! 🏌️‍♂️⛳️🏌️‍♂️As a amateur golfer myself the tips and information you share are a massive help! 👏👏👏
The best one yet, Ian Poulter is a proper gent
Rip Jamal 🙏
I could beat him with just a 6-iron.
All about the golf... just fantastic!! Exactly how you want a round to be with buddies
Poulter has won a fan. Good job 👍🏽
Rick, look at your aim on #10
These 10 shot challenges are always great. Being from the U.S. I have watched Ian clutch up many of times and now Rick got to feel that personally great match you guys. Ian is a beast.
6:14, you had plenty of room. And being that you slice everything anyway, you'd be on the green no problem.     My kidding,.. kind of.
Great content Rick..👌
what a video  and wow ians bag is pure lush
That was class. Love listening to the pros and how they approach each shot. Poults was no different. A great insight
oh man he flew over the boonkuh
Poults is great.
Jimmy Bullard v Rick the game we all want to see
I love watching you Rick but the bloody adverts are doing my head in,totally spoiling it for me.
Ian is a gem. Really enjoyed his commentary.
Great video! Took me 3 sittings to watch it but loved it!
Absolutely great content. More of these. Make em long. The openness about his thoughts and processes was brilliant content
Didn't expect being glued to a screen for nearly 2 hours listening to Ian Poulter.
Personally I get more of an education and entertainment value from these rounds than I do watching any pro tournament on the TV!  Great stuff as always, Rick!  I'll look forward to the next one!
Wonder how to go about getting Ian, Lee and Darin out for a pint?
I'm going to go out on a limb here before watching the video and say"no"
And this is why we love Ian Poulter. fantastic match.
You've lost my support. These LIV players have chosen to sports wash murders... integrity means something.
Was fortunate enough to play with Ian in the BMW Pro-Am at Wentworth a couple of years ago, and he was just as he appears here. Great company (and a fellow Gooner 😊).
Now that Ian was on the channel will he win a tourney soon? Hopefully. What a great guy and unreal golfer.
I always thought Poulter was a dick...but he really seems like a great guy.  Great playing mate!
Ian I’d have said some of those putts, the hole was crowned! 😂
Love the conversations about shot shape, I’d have just chipped it down the fairway! 😂
Brilliant video mate. One of your best!!
Best 10 shot challenge yet 😃👍🏻🏌️‍♂️
Just pouch out, why are you trying to hit shots you don’t have in your bag?
really enjoyed this one Rick.  Ian is one of golfs most down to earth players and a real pleasure to watch.  totally agree with other comments.  Thanks.
Probably my favourite one of these videos to date. Love how Ian explains his shots so we can get inside his head a bit. Great video.
9 over with 4 doubles is very relatable.
Finally got round to watching this. Rick played some terrific shots, and it was fantastic seeing Poulter recover hole by hole. One of my favourite videos on this channel yet!
The Rod Stewart of golf, class
Amazing content. Just have the feeling the latest videos suffer from sound quality which doesn’t match the rest. Maybe there is a chance to improve the mics..
one of the best of this series by far! Ian gives so much great info
I have to say, I wasn't a big fan of Ian in my limited time as a golf fan. Watching this and his interview has drastically changed my opinion of him and would love to see more of him on the channel. Not sure I am hooked enough to start watching a ton of LIV events, but I am a big fan of him personally after this.
If you dont want to watch this whole thing, skip to 1:43 :)
Are u a scratch golfer ?
it was always the hooded 8 iron
That 13th hole battered you rick. Amazing challenge.
Greatest challenge video ever!
That was an EPIC round all around brother man! Absolutely amazing content as usual!
Rick could definitely turn pro if he worked on his chipping and short pitching shots but I guess that's what separates pros and amateurs is the fact its not easy to be good at both long and short game. I found from own personal experience its like a see saw because they are completely different techniques and if you work on one more than the other its like they offset each other, its quite a feat to keep both at high level and that see saw at level.
This just two guys having a round of golf, great fun.
Love poults what a top top bloke and that’s coming from a spurs fan. Westwood was the funniest tho
great stuff
That was entertainment, so good to watch, and Poults is your best guest yet what a ledge!
Best one yet, Ian just a typical English bread golfer, top geezer, time to order myself a majestic top !
This was awesome ! Enjoyed it very much !
EPIC
Brilliant video - one of the best pros you've had on and despite the shady golf there were genuine moments of brilliance.  Loved the way Ian really turned on the competive edge as the match got closer.
A great vlog, beautiful golf course and what a gent is Ian Poulter
This is the best one yet !! Ian is a comedian lol
Rick that was awesome. Ian Poulter is a class guy. He is one of my favorite golfers. I loved the banter and also how he thinks around the course. Also the mind of a champion. “game on” when they have to turn on the switch.
One of your best, as usual the roller coaster ride that is Rick Shiels but mate…what a match, and you did give him a run for his money on the 18th!  Poults was a legend especially his face pulling when you weren’t looking. whose next Rick!
Rick, I love everything about this channel. It has genuinely made me fall in love with this sport. But so much of this game is psychological and seems that is your weakest habit. It’s getting hard to watch you lose the battle in your head. You’re taken out of the shot before you even swing. I hate this for you. Hats off to Ian with how helpful he is.
This is one of the prettiest golf courses Ive ever seen.  I abhor those God-awful looking links courses.  This would be my dream course!  How can something that beautiful exist in dreary effing UK?????
Just one of the greatest competitors in the game. It’s so much fun to see him in more of a relaxed setting and format. Another amazing video Rick. Absolutely enjoyed it from start to finish. Keep the great content coming. That is a perfect example of such a legend like Ian talking through his shot and thought process and his total competitive drive. Definitely my favorite 10 shot challenge so far. ⛳️🏌️‍♂️
I know I'm late watching this one but this has been an absolute treat to watch! Ian is such an amazing person. It is wild how a professionals mind works on the golf course. Maybe one day I can get a round of golf with Ian. :)
By far, the best beat a pro (-10) series yet. On paper, this guy, Poulter, shoulda been a real *ick.  Like Westwood was a *ick.  Oh no, Poulter was fantastic.  Precisely the kind a guy I'd like to play with.  Well done Rick & Ian!  Good fun!
Best video you’ve ever done, Rick. Congrats to you and the team!
Best RS video ever
Best guest ever. Hope to see Ian again.
This is one of the best golf vlogs I have ever watched. Ian Poulter is just gold. Amazing golfer and so funny. What a great guy.
Best 10 shot challenge by far, the insight into both Ian & how to consider & play holes was phenomenal 👏👏
What a beautiful course, nice to see that when under the trees there are still problems not like the US courses!
Poulter proper let you off on some holes. Feeling sorry for you he was.
So many adverts.
Digested that over 3 sittings. Pure class😂😂😂. Best content on the tube
We’re you cold Rick, Ian is in his sorts!
Best video ever.  Ian's response on 17 is classic!!
Love your content Rick but it's completely spoiled by 2 bloody adverts ever 5 minutes, completely uncalled for and we can't even skip after 5 seconds, for crying out loud sort that out please or I'll have to go elsewhere, which would be a shame as I like you.
Oh. My. DAYS! What a banger of a video this is. Ian is such an incredible guy. Plus, you two together on the course makes great content. Major credits to Ian though, for being the gentleman he is. Absolute joy to watch!
Some people have issues with Ian. I think he is fantastic. Good playing guys
Very entertaining indeed. Thank you both for that.
Great contest
Is it cold or not??   Polter in shorts and shirt, Rick in full winter gear ..
Naughty Ian the ball moved on his practice stroke when he was in the trees first 9 holes
best episode... thoroughly enjoyed watching this today at work
The Quality of this is ridiculous ! hats off to your media department 👌👌
What a course, beautiful.
Great video Rick 🙌🏻
first 2 holes I'm wondering how you have a career in golf :-).....actually most holes!
Ian's additional commentary and facial expressions are next level... Amazed at how many details the pros consider before every shot. I've never once thought about the spin on a shot.  Lastly, I like how you booked it with him right after his family vacation as he looked a bit rusty in spots.
Just tremendous entertainment Rick. Absolutely love Ian Poulter 👍⛳
Perfect episode.... Would watch at the 2 of you playing ALL DAY LONG !!!! Next one, please play a Scramble Rick + Ian vs Pete + Lee ... 😵😵
"I get a little silly nervous." Maybe it's just audio editing. If so, disregard it. But in the past few videos that you've done like this when you speak over the ball, you mishit it. Maybe stick to the talking pre-walk-up.
which woburn course was this out of the three they have ?
Rick trying to play match play on the last against the ryder cup master.... Great vid Rick!
Rick brings up a great point...it's so great to hear what these pros are thinking on various shots.
Please do the next one with Henrik Stenson
Is Ian poulter another one of Rod Stewart's children???  He looks like him, sounds like him and has the same mannerisms as him!!!!
Natural shot shape you ask? A push block off the first tee.
Simply brilliant.  Not the best golf at times, but thats what makes it so much like the rest of us. And it looked such a laugh.  Great video, more please.
"I have taken a few of them down the 18th hole" 😂. Rick, should it not be "I lasted until the 18th hole" 😜
Great video.
Great content. It's about golf, but it's not all about golf. I could feel the chemistry.
Poulter has one of the best short games I've ever watched .I've seen him make some amazing up and downs .
Great vid.
Best video I have seen for ages. Ian Poulter's thought processes were something out of this world and something we can all learn from.
I've never seen someone overcomplicate the game so much in my life. Poulter the exact opposite.
E.P.I.C.
One of most related relateable videos! Showing us why we shouldn't take those hero shots since we aren't Ian...
Best 10 shot challenge so far - great match proves why Ian needs to be in the Ryder Cup team!
56:06 Thank me later 😂😂
the best challenge yet both this and the pod cast with Ian absolute top draw. What an ambassador for golf Ian is. A normal bloke who is a STAR
Ian poulter legend
Start with 15 shots I’d like to see you win one.
I just became a massive Ian Poulter fan. Rick looked to be on cloud 9 at points. Amazing.
That was brilliant !! So interesting to hear their thoughts !!
Great vid Rick! But seriously…ads every 6 minutes? I know it’s your income but it’s too much.
I do wish you would just hit the ball without the in depth discussion about what shot you're attempting.
Absolute favorite in this series.  Ian Poulter is a class act for sure.
big fun between wimbledon and the open- i love these charismatic guys!
Poulter is renowned for his fanforanade and flamboyance but beneath it he truly is a nice guy . Very caring paternal is his nature the way he guided Rick around the course the way he strove to keep the greens free of debris cleaning them . I have a vague recollection of I Justin rose saying in the early days touring poulter was like his father on tour organising his stuff make sure he didn’t leave things in hotels rooms and so on .
Brilliant episode, "can I call you Poults yet" Gold!
lot of fun to watch! thanks for this.
Ian has gained a new fan, what a legend he is. Such a nice fun dude.
Best one yet! Ian’s thought process behind each shot is so thorough and it’s great to be able to experience what he goes through with every shot.
Just realised Poulter sounds exactly like Baldrick and now I can't unhear it...
10 under par VS tour pro easily my favourite series on the channel. Helps with legends of the game such as Poults making appearances. 👍🏼
Loved this video! It's just so entertaining.
That was the best stroke play match you have ever had! The back and forth you and Ian have is great! You definitely need to have him back on.
Postman delivered again
There is no way Rick is pro 🤣
This was an absolutely stellar and riveting video!  Great work and there were some crazy shots!
To listen to Ian talk us through all the shots was awesome. What a guy. Thanks Rick and team❤
The tubes and ange golf life channel is way better than this!
As all has mentioned, Ian thought process is awesome and thank you Ian for sharing that with us.  For real Ian Poulter, you just made me a fan of yours!
It’s hard to judge the difficulty of the course when I’m not there in person, but if this was my video, I’d let Ian play through and I’d change the title to break 95
It amazes me Ian is worried about spin with his wedges to the green, and Rick walks up hitting full wedge shots in. Gotta practice those 3/4 low spin shots mate it would have saved you a couple
Hi. Im trying to watch a 2 hour advert for compare the meerkat but every so often, some footage of you playing golf with ian poulter pops up. Please fix this editing bug. Thanks
Can someone put together all Rick’s videos and do a handicap for him hahaha
What a nice guy,  fair play. Great video
Yeah, you definitely need to have Ian back. Great match, a lot of fun to watch.
Of all the RS videos I’ve watched these past few years this has got to be top 3 of not The Best for all the reasons previously stated here.
Best guest ever. What a guy! Would love to see him back on the channel asap, what a video, and what a match!🤩
Great video, Ian is such a character and a great guest. What a challenge
Counting the times Rick says “damn” in a weird American accent. 🥴
Ian Poulter was the best pro guest you've had on. Just looked like he enjoys playing golf and having fun. Not up himself or anything. What a brilliant final 4-5 holes guys. I really enjoyed that!!
there's soemthing wrong during hole 14. Ian put his drive all the way left, and thena ha makes a shot from the right corner of the fairway ith the 3 wood. Did you lose a shot of his there?
Love Poults❤
I'll be honest I've never liked Ian Polter but after this video I've changed my mind I think he's OK. A bit of a laugh actually......
One of my favourite vids of yours Rick, did not feel like a 2 hour video! Ian was brilliant throughout, his reaction to you hitting the tree had me in stitches! If only the second or third on the last had gone in, would have been an all time moment
What a legend Ian Poulter Reminded us all what a top bloke he really is!!
I NEED TO GO TO BED BUT CAN’T TURN IT OFF!!!!! This video is incredible!
This is by FAR THE best golf video on YouTube. Easily! Epic!!
Brilliant video! What a guy Ian is, big fan!
Constructive feedback from a long time subscriber that watches all of your videos - great content Rick and I watched it all, but this time around the advertisement frequency made it a hard watch for me. Not sure if you choose how frequently they pop up or if that is outside your control, and I get that Ad revenue is what this is about, but there needs to be a balance and felt that it  was too far the wrong way. Not sure I'd watch another 2 hour video with ads interrupting it every few minutes (yes I know I can skip some of them but it breaks the flow up too much...)
My favourite golf Pro video so far. Would be great to see you both play a course you don't know or him play a course you know know well.
i grew up watching ian when hes on top of the world ranking and winning tournament...hes a very nice lad
Great entertainment guys. Thank you. Love watching this series and I dare say this was the best of them so far.
Total legend still one of my favourites! Get in poults 🤘🏽
Poults for the pro's get him in the ryder cup! Epic video ⛳
What an amazing video. Great guest and one of the best vids you’ve done! 👏
Trees and golf don't mix.. stick to links!
Well now Ian Poulter is now one of my favourite players, along with Lee Westwood.. What a cool guy Ian is!!
What an episode! A pure thriller on the last hole.
Can we please stop hyping Rick as a good golfer. Dude has got passed up by the other golf influencers.
Thats not fair  As a pro i feel rick ahould be able to olay even quite regularly.    How often does poulter go around -10 ?
Poulter gave so much advice during the round...more than anyone else.
Best one yet 😁
That course looks like an absolute pig to play! More trees that the forest moon of Endor.  Great vid as usual.
Why do you bottle it every time you play a pro?  Your a good player yourself fix your mindset ❤
Loved this video!!! Thanks Rick, team and Ian.
The channel just gets better and better. Fantastic video guys, congratulations!
First time seeing this channel. Enjoyed this immensely. Great video. New subscriber here. 👌👌👌👌
"Absolute dogmeat!" It's perfect!!! 😂🤣😂 Legendary!
What an absolute legend Ian is. It was excellent hearing his golf dialogue which you don’t normally hear. Such a nice and humble guy. Great video again. Loved it.
His shot by shot insight was invaluable. Wonderful content.
Ian has a fun personality
He is a nice guy and listening to him and the time he gave Rick was great - however I think he held back a bit as was sooooo relaxed.. Another reason why he hasn't won any majors or multiple big tourny's, he's to nice, and lacks that killer instinct - he should have wanted to have professionally destroyed Rick, whilst of course still being a nice guy (as that's how he is)
What a great watch that was. It’s great to see these tour pros putting in time to see their golf in a normal environment. Brilliant.
One of the best videos you’ve done! Mad ending
Gentlemen, this was wonderful, almost two hours pure and best level entertainment. Rick, this was the best "10 under chalenge" of all and Mr. Poulter, I hope to see you more often again after the merrge is done, you´re my Mr. Matchplay!
Absolutely brilliant video!
Best golf video ever. Mr Poulter is the topiest of top blokes. There's a regular series right there called "Poults talks his round". I learnt so much from just listening to Poulter talking through his shots.
Out of all the YouTube Pros I genuinely believe that Rick is one of the worst out there. True classic ‘I’m going to draw it off the right’ or ‘I’ll start this over the bunker and fade it it’ - then inevitably shanks it somewhere else. A really poor advert for a PGA Professional.
pass
SIR IAN POULTER
By far the best one of these Iv seen. Loved Poults through his career but just seems like such a genuine guy. Love it 👍
What a class act Ian Poulter is 👏
Poults is my absolute childhood hero and Ryder Cup icon but LIV destroyed it so bad
Favourite episode yet!!!!!! Keep the content coming 👍🇦🇺
What a great video. It was really interesting to listen to how Ian thought his way around the golf course, describing how he wanted each shot to play and how to manage each situation. He came across as a nice guy who loves the game (he definitely wanted to win but seems genuinely pleased when you played a good shot). I really would like to see him as a Ryder Cup captain one day.
Ians just a real decent guy isn’t he 👌
Great Video, Love Poults. Thanks Rick
Unreal from Poults, so interesting to hear his thoughts and he was so involved.
U get a lot of luck Rick more than I see of others on a course without it I’d say u are a good 8/10 marker at best
The best video so far, a true gent. Only made my fondness for him stronger.
I'm really enjoying the 10 shot challenge.  And now I'm a Ian Poulter fan!!!!!😄
Best one yet. Did anyone really think Poulter would miss that putt on 18. Very engaging and enjoyable to watch.
Ian is a player, he led you into taking the 'tree hit' shot.
Brilliant show. Really great episode. Of all the people in the whole wide world to go down the last with level!! 😂 you did well Rick.
Late to comment, because I've watched over several parts.. but dead set that was the absolute best! Amazing golf theatrics and just an incredible watch! Loved the drama, editing was A-class and the best 10-shot challenge yet!! Well done Rick & the team :)
I like your channel Rick but TOO MANY ADVERTS!!!! It's every 2 minutes there's a double unskippable advert. Its painful. Give a bit back eh??
great video! i am no expert but I noticed on a lot of Rick's tee shots his feet are causing the semi slice right. That said Rick still hits it straighter than me
Was this before or after your chipping lesson with Dan Grieve? To my amateur eye you weren't chipping like he taught
I thoroughly enjoyed that! As an Aussie, I’m a massive fan of Poults!
It’s great to see both you and Poults find some of the places I hit from every week!
How many adverts during this video….
Littered with ads
Absolutely loved this video, great to see how Ian approached his shots and what club to use etc. And some of the shots hit by both were brilliant. Looking forward to the next one.  Keep up the great content
Loved this love ricks chest thump😝😝😝😝
Best video yet Rick. Really enjoyed it. Ian is a funny guy!
Need to play keswick golf course in cumbria 👍
What an absolute elite dap up at the end 😮
The best one yet without a doubt. Thank you
I can't stand Poulter ever since he lost it on a flight as he had to look after his own kids as the babysitter could not get a seat in first class. Can't bring myself to watch, although I love the channel.
I didn't realize how good a game Dorothy Perkins talks as well as plays. Friday night staple viewing for me, more please.
This was an absolutely fantastic round of golf with a very humble and generous guest. Ian Poulter has now become one of my favourite professional golfers. Superb content Rick, keep doing what you’re doing.
Need more adverts next time
Best yet Rick
When I wasn’t watching twenty second ads that was a great video!
Phenomenal content .
Great watch.
best episode so far. ian is hilarious.
How good was Poults. Just solidifying his status as one of if not the most entertaining and also genuine blokes on tour. Just brilliant. Rick it’s be great to see if you could do more with him. Loved every minute. Thank you Ian!!
Rick - please stick to your draw , you haven’t hit a ‘butter fade ‘ with an iron in YouTube history  Every time you go for the fade off the tee it’s so low % for you , stick to the draw please
Absolutely brilliant, I can imagine a lot of work to clip this. Just want to say thanks for the entertainment
Challenge Henrik stetson...
Ian is a Saudi shill.
I would see Rory McIlroy or Tyrrell Hatton 😂
What a great guy, Mr Ryder cup Poulter 👍
wow IP looks like an absolute gem to be with. What a guy
Rick starting to get boring
Got me wondering if I could beat a tour pro with a 10 shot head start 😂
The best video by far brilliant thank you guys
Man.i wished you had stuck w your gut for the hook on 13. I feel like your confidence was high then deflated.
What a great guest Ian was! Would love to see him more. He was made for YouTube.
Great banter. I could see a regular poults showing on the channel. I'd watch every one.
audios a little hot... loved the video though!
"What's he gonna do? Make everyone laugh on YouTube..."  Mate: all of us wish we were a quarter as good as you!
Great video
Rick's channels is second to none.  Just magic
Love when you play pros, always a good watch
What a great vid! Ian seems like the guy you’d like to have a beer with after a round. Best of the challenge vids so far!
Little chippy sliced 3 sood. 😂😂😂
Absolute entertainment, loved every minute of this.
Most exciting match… even more than Ricky. Epic putt on 17 incredible 18th too
Rick finally said it: “I’m a back 9 player.” He so is. Bringing the drama to the finish! Love it rick. Best golf content out there. Keep up the great work!
Brother, you make some great content. Thanks for all you do.
New channel, one day I'll film with Rick
I would love to see Ian on again in the future.
I just wish Rick would trust the chipping lesson he got reverted back to his old style in this video
Ian Poulter won 3 times on the PGA tour.   Only the most devout golf fans would know his name.
1:43:00 my favourite part of the round
every time rick starts a sentence with the word, right. Take a shot!
I love the banter
Ian was the best person you've had on by far. I wouldn't mind seeing you face him or Rickie again.
Ian was hilarious and so candidate. One of your best videos ever!
Amazing video cheers Rick
You should have made it match play starting 8 holes up.
That was the best episode yet. IJP always a joy to watch and hear what comes out of his mouth.  Well done.
So Rick does break 75 , meaning his handicap would definitely be higher than a 3 … a tour pro is at least a +6 …. He needs more than 10 shots to beat a real pro  These pros aren’t even playing that well , I would’ve expected them to be shoot at least 5/6 under of more in a relaxed setting like this
I am an Ian Poulter fan now! Seems like a really good guy.
Most entertaining 10 shot challenge so far . So awesome !
❤️💯ian was great ! The thought process was priceless. Good stuff Rick. 👍
This is gotta be the best video ever.
Would love to see Rick against Miguel Ángel Jiménez.
Dope content
Hole 14 was a ridiculously entertaining hole of golf to watch. What a roller coaster. That bogey for Rick, heartbreaking. Sorry man. There are better holes ahead, Rick.
Amazing match. Ian is a legend
Poulteris such a cool 😎
If ya close yer eyes and just listen, you just might think that Rick booked  a round with Rod The Mod.
im amaze that rick shiel still no 1 youtube golfer, the way he's playing is not the best yet people watch him. is it because people relate to his game or is there something else?
Have loved Ian Poulter for years ... a guy who plays wonderful golf and ... dresses like the winner he is!
@1:43:01 Ian....
Ian was so engaged and it just made the video amazing, what a pleasure
Big Poulter fan after this one. Being from the US have never paid too much attention to him but what a class act.
i think ian would make an amazing youtube channel. hes got that twinkle in his eyes
Ian laughing at Rick with some horrible shots is hilarious.
That was AWESOME.  To teach, compete, and entertain all at the same time, all the while behaving as proper gentlemen is extraordinary to watch.  The English may be the best globally at language and communication skills.
Do you really need an ad every 3 minutes?
Great match! Poulter is awesome to watch … Rick I thought ya had ur best shot in this one soooo close man!!  I look forward to ur next match  I’m hoping to see Stenson, he’d be great to watch 👌
This is a unbelievable video, great banter with Ian. Thank you for the great content!!!
Could I ask what the thought process was on hitting driver down the 17th Rick? 😂
43:42 A "Soft Open Faced Chipped 3 Wood Slice" sounds like a sandwich you get at the turn!😂😂
Just finished watching this. I have always enjoyed watching Ian Poulter, but I think he is my new favorite PGA professional. He was so nice and genuine. Loved it!
I love these because you get to see the pros personalities!! Awesome videos!!! Well done!!!!
Considering the couple of double bogeys, Rick played some really great golf here. Excellent iron and 3wd shots.
I'm really glad you made these videos with Ian.   He was always one of my favorites until the LIV thing. Unfortunately, and unfairly, I  lumped him in with my feelings about that tour, and really turned on him.   This one in particular reminded me of why I liked him in the first place. It makes me feel a little bad that I let something like a business decision, made for reasons to which I'm not privy, change my opinion of a person.   I was right in the first place. Good guy. Thanks Rick. It's good to be back on the Poulter Train!
How the hell is a YooToobr getting these guys to give up a day fer nuthin? I bet Ricky F doesn't get out of bed for less than $200K !
I love all of these challenges but Ian undoubtedly made this one very, very special. What a great guest and an epic match. Exceptional content!
As a HUGE American Ryder Cup fan, Ian used to drive me INSANE! Although I always respected his game, now I respect him 10 times more for the person he is! Great video!! Cheers to you and Ian, Rick!!😎🍻
Hey Pete, I work for Stryker, the leading manufacturer in defib technology. Let me know if you'd like me to connect you to some people who can help with your cause!  I'm sure I could get the UK team to hook you up with products and training!
I've never seen this side of Poults before. He's not how I thought he would be.
Ian Poulter what an absolute Legend!!
ricks ass now
Goodness me. Easily the best episode thus far. What a match. What entertainment!!! Ian is a great dude! God bless ya Rick and keep up on the great content.
That was an absolute wonderful 2 hours of entertainment!! And Ian Poulter ... he may well be my new favorite player. Awesome!
My word!! Such a great match and a fantastic guest!! Ian Poulter replacing divots for Rick. Lol.  Honestly, best match I have seen. Great podcast with Mr. Poulter too.
Wow! Tremendous video.  I feel the Full Swing documentary didn't do Mr  Poulter justice.  What an absolute gem.  I could watch him break down yardages all day.  Can we get a rematch with you and Guy playing a scramble straight up?
Really enjoyed this video.  Great content.
This is the best video of this series so far. Poulter is a huge part of my fondest memories watching golf and he came across like an absolute gent here. Brilliant stuff. Just hoping you get Lowry and Harrington on someday.
It is fascinating to hear the thought process of a tour pro as they play a course.
Just pure nerves at the start...like all of us.
I just love how genuinely happy Ian Poulter is when Rick hits a great shot. What a great episode !!
Great guest. Great content.
短気ですから、お気を付けてwww
The best 10 shot challenge yet. Ian is a Top Man.
These videos are so nice for a beginner, really helps with my own course management. Amazing video once again Rick!
Nice job fellas! Besides Trent’s breaking 90 series, this is my favorite.   We need more Ian making casual golf for the YouTube’s.
11:15 Is Rick not PG anymore 😂
Wonderful!!!!
I feel like Ian played a little too good on the last hole there 😂   Without a doubt the best guest you’ve had for this series. Awesome video!
Probably a lot more Ian Poulter fans created after watching this...
Wow Ian Poulter is just radiating class in this video. The ending was a real nail biter! You should try to challenge Michael Block or Joel Dahmen! Both of them would be a lot of fun for you! And for us to watch! Great job Rick!
you two had way too much fun.  Made it fun for me.
Entertaining for sure. Thank you Ian and Rick. Great to hear your thoughts on shot selection and club choice.
Really like this video Rick and Ian!!! I loved hearing Ian's thought process on ever shot!  Just a phenomenal video and a awesome course as well! And I love how all the pros like click a switch when things get close!  And you asked Ian who you should play next I like his choice!  I would love to see you play Scottie Scheffler.    Thanks for all you do Rick always love your videos.
This match was fantastic. Course looks fantastic too. Great content Rick
What an enjoyable watch.
Won't watch #bonesawtour players.
My question for Ian is would he have played a giant hook with that 9 iron in a tourney round, or would he have punched out for a full shot 3rd?
That was fun!!!
Did Rick ever update his clubs in the bag in a video?
Loved it thanks.
I agree, that Ian Poulter was a great host...interesting to hear his commentary on distance, wind etc. I was expecting some more fashionable clothing!
Wonderful video and fantastic finish!
Part of the price of selling out I guess  How do I stop getting these as recommended videos as I've unsubstantiated
That was a solid match! fun to watch!
What a great match. Thanks to Booth guys
hey Rick you cant put to save your life dude
Best video so far now I can see why Ian is a great golfer over the years in Ryder Cup,keep up the great work Rick love the banter looking forward to the Royal Liverpool video.⛳️🏌️‍♂️👍🏻👊🏻
Another fantastic 10 shot challenge and even brought me back slightly towards Poults after his LIV decision. Have to ask though, what is up with Rick's "Dayem" comment so often🤔🤣
Ian was helping with every single shot and sharing the course knowledge, what a great guest, the best you ever had Rick!
Golf is hard! Great watch even the good guys are human!
Epic entertainment. ❤
The only thing that could make these videos better would be a live stream during the actual game play.
Great match👌🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♂️
Hands down best golf video I've ever seen. Ian Poulter's graciousness and full commitment was just awesome.
starts at 10 under but thumbnails 8 under??? your brain ok rick?
What's your gin handicap rick?
These trees are giving me anxiety.
That’s why golf is the best game & sport of al times.
Great video really enjoyed the last hour Poulter is a legend
I have watched Ian Poulter for years on Tour. I never was a fan till this video. His personality definitely made this video. That and Rick plating out of the woods. When when Poulter said you pulled it you should’ve said yes I poultered it!
Rick played excellent golf for the most part and the entire experience reminds me why we all love Ian so much.
Still not sure about this.
Great fun, Ian's a good guy, well done both
Ian is my new favorite pro golfer/you tube human. As humble as a bee keeper this man.
I have always appreciated Ian Poulter's personality and class.
This was an absolutely brilliant episode, Rick & Team! A pleasure to watch and I hope Poults comes back again for ya's for another round.
That  was unreal - best one of these I've seen yet. I always liked Poulter but this gave me a whole new appreciation of the man - what an absolute gent and such great craic as well!
Fowler and Poulter tied for best guests, but this might be the best golf video on YouTube. Really amazing.
I thought the podcast interview was great, but as you said at the end, this is epic! I can’t love the postman any more. What a wonderful video. Thank you so much for this. 👍👏😀
This was amazing to experience. Thanks Rick & Ian!
Ian absolutely talked Rick into trying that hooked 2nd shot around the tree from the rough on the 17th hole, and them clunk as it hit the tree..🤣! But what a great guest, very competitive, but willing to share his shot thoughts, and suggesting possible out shots for Rick too, what a great guest and player..👍👏👏🏌🏼‍♂️
He was such a class act, any chance to get him back on please take it! Great match
One of your best ones Rick. Great to see Ian Poulter lock in on the last few holes. We all hate losing
@RickShiels I challenge you to a 9/18 hole match play, loser donates £1,000 to a charity chosen by you. I’m a 16 handicapper and think I can beat you by starting -10. I’m Manchester based so I’ll let you decide time and place 😎😀 It’s an opportunity for you to play match play against a fan and all for a good charity. Let’s get it on 👀🏌️‍♂️😂
Ian is a class act.   Can't really blame him for taking $20-$30 Million signing bonus at 47 years old.  🙂
That course is more forest than fairway!!! Can’t believe how tight is is and credit to both for being able to make it round in one piece….
This video must have been before the most recent range session because the swing looks pretty bad - no improvements. Other than that, cool vid.
why do you say "Damn" like that??
I thoroughly enjoy your break 65, 75 and guest pro golfer episodes. But this was the best by far. Was amazing to hear Ian talk through each shot. But I laughed out loud when he had to hit through a group of trees. Ian; Other than that tree and that tree and low branch and the 150 marker, nothing to worry about!
Jesus I didn’t realize how bad Rick actually is
Absolutely brilliant, one of the best YouTube golf vids ever IMO, cracking job Rick!
I'll be completely honest. The only experience I've had with Ian is like most, watching on TV. I thought he was a bit over the top, cocky and a bit arrogant. I'm happy to say I feel completely wrong in my previous opinion. He seems like a very approachable and nice guy. I know see what I used to see as passion, confidence and extreme desire to compete at the highest level. Thank you Rick and thank you Ian for doing this and taking us all along with you. I was incredible!
That was a great match to watch.
I don’t think I’d be taking anything out of the bag longer than a 7-iron at Woburn.
I love these - I have so many pro golfers to cheer for thanks to this series! Fowler, Poulter, Scott, Westwood, etc.. please keep them coming
Loved every single minute of it, bring Ian in on a regular basis 😉 he is the best
Easily the best episode you've ever made.
What a video. Hate to say it Rick, but it was the only time I wanted the tour pro to win…just shows what a decent bloke Ian Poulter is. Great viewing and my admiration and appreciation for Ian Poulter has grown significantly.
What a match!! Loved it!!
when do you ever hit your driver 250? not sure why you used it on 17 mate. when Ian is using an iron. great video and entertainment.
Great video, one of the best! Really enjoyed the watch 🙂
I think Rick gets so much out of these pros that you see a side of them that you never see on tour. Phenomenal content and Poults was fantastic. Big fan.
Not been a huge fan of Ian this past few years but he comes across really well in this video. Very open and friendly seemed like a really nice guy.
Mr poulter did this instead of trying to qualifing for the Open.
I had the entirely wrong vibe of Ian before this. What a great dude.
Best one yet ! You guys were great together !
That was an awesome video, best one yet. IJP was humble,funny and supportive, seems like a really sound guy, someone you could have a beer with. Ryder Cup Hero 👍
I was transfixed by the whole video! As usual, great entertainment! Ian was brilliant not just for this video, but the pod too - we love gaining as much insight into the life and game of the tour guys as possible! Well done - can’t wait for the next instalment!
Genuinely think I’d even beat you and I’m a 20 handicap.
You had 142 you’ve now got 135 🤣🤣 quality content Rick absolute quality loved poults just chatting his game. Great golfer and great bloke
What a guy Ian poulter is!! Best 1 yet rick 😃
Very cool video
Poults is an absolute legend. 👌Loved every second of this video!
What a great video 🙌🏻
What a great guest Ian was - I was never quite sure if he is a good lad - but he’s tops in my books after this
Ian absolute class hahah 1:42:59
Ian is one of the more down to earth and humbling liv-ers…he’s not consumed by the money or publicity, he’s just polite and genuine.
What an awesome, down-to-earth guy Ian Poulter is. Top entertainment from both of you, and especially Ian's Baldrick impersonation from start to finish! 😅
Odd question: why take your glove off between shots, only to put it back on?
Great watch. Poults is a legend.
good evening rICK. I am currently in a mental health hospital and your videos are really interesting and often funny i have watched about 20 vids between yourself, golf life and peter finch. So thank you for making a difference in very tough situation.
That was class 👏🏻
It was a great match, 👏👍🧿
I think all of your guests have been awesome and Ian is no exception. What an absolute pleasure it was to listen to his thought process as he approached each shot. And what an “on course” lesson it was for you personally. They way he’s asked you to talk you through your club and shot selection and then offered his advice was first class. What an entertaining video series. Long may they continue.
What a great video, the best one yet I was 😂 so much, great game I honestly thought Rick got the ball in the hole on the approach shot on the18th. Loved it
Saw Ian at Wentworth last year (2022) chilling out on the 3rd tee during a fog delay. Seemed a proper chill dude, stood for some photos etc.
Ians a legend, lovely chap and down to earth chatty bloke.  And what a great matchup.
Yeah, just a great episode. Well done all round 👍👍
Slapstick start. Lol. Cheers gents.
The small bucket of balls off the first was hilarious!
That was awesome, how cool is Ian Poulter!
Looked like a really good time out there,and some occasional exceptional shots by Poult… and Rick! Get Ice man on Troon, just do it.
Rick I’m a big fan of these videos, but simply put there are far too many adverts placed into the video. almost 2 hours is a long enough without having to sit through all those ads as Well. Pls sort it out!
I really enjoyed this video. It's fascinating to listen to Ian Poulter's thought process before each shot. This is the part of the game that you never get the chance to hear, so I really do like that RSG is able to bring this to us. Well done guys!
This is the course i play in my nightmares 😂 the amount of balls i’d loose
Ian was great, as was you Rick.
That was awesome. Ian is all class
One of my favourite episodes 👏
Love this match with Poults.....music spoils it though 👍
Ian’s fun personality shone through on camera, but so did his dogged determination to win down the stretch. Outstanding golf entertainment, I hope there is a rematch one day. Ian would make a brilliant golf commentator one day.
That was so entertaining especially towards the end. Can’t tell you how much I love these 10 shot challenges. The trees at this place are insane though 😂 Despite Ian not having his best stuff I think he still showed the real class difference between tour pros and the rest of us - their ability to get up and down and eliminate big numbers is so good. Did anyone else notice how satisfyingly perfect his divots are as well??
Brilliant video Rick 👍
Rick, I'd like you to try taming that wrist hinge so early in the take away.
What an absolute brilliant golf match and YouTube video.  Ian Poulter is a total legend as well as showing great sportsmanship ❤
Amazing content... But whats going on with the amount of ads in the video... Faaaar too many
It's amazing the thought process of these tour pros.
Ian’s tee shot on 14th said shot number 2. Come on Rick. Standards are slacking.
That last hole was epic, that's how a match should finish! 👏🏼🏌🏽‍♂️👑
Fantastic💪
Top Man. Stunning course. Great stuff Rick.
The Postman Delivered Again
For whatever reason I thought Ian was a cocky sod, I couldn't have been more wrong. A gentleman is what I see. Never believe the gutter press.
Just shy of 2 hours? That's a movie!
No conversation with the player
Best one yet!
What a great video, how awesome is Ian Poulter. You both made the game fun , hope you do get the iceman next as well. Keep them coming.
So thankful, Ian Poulter agreed to play in the 10 under series. Ian is on of my favorite Tour Pro’s. Also, Woburn is a treat! Which course was it that you played?
It seemed like when you got to 17 the greens start drying and speeding up.
p
Hear the the one about the famous Russian golfer IN-OV-THE-TREE
Hard luck Rick you played well ian was so helpful all the way round top bloke and atop video mate
What a finish 👏 a great video Poults what a guy to play against.
Hard luck Rick you played well i would love a round with ian he was helpful all the way around with you top bloke and a top video
Hard Luck Rick you played well i would love a round with ian he was so helpful to you and made it a relaxing top bloke great video mate
Great video Poults is a legend well done Rick.
Great to see how Ian really entered into the spirit of this and played some really entertaining golf. Rick, tour golf is always entertaining!😂
Never expected Ian to be such a first class gent. What a nice surprise.
Gotta love Poults… even though he’s an Arsenal fan 😄
Love Ian, great guy, very encouraging and funny. Great match. He’s just done a video with Lee Westwood on Tubes & Ange golf life, with Jimmy Bullard. Worth a watch also.
Outstanding match
Best ten shot challenge ever and most entertaining/informative video on YouTube!!!!!!
Far too many adverts. Great content but spoilt.
Great watch. Something Rick touched on at one point was listening to what was going on with Ian Poulters thought process. It would be great to get some insight with pro's talking us through the shot before they play it and the adjustments they make based on lie, wind, etc. Again, fantastic entertainment. Thank you to the both of you.
Rick WTF??? You suck man!!! I ROOT for you everytime and you give me shit……I’m gonna start going for the Pro… come on man… get your shit together😂😂😂😂
How is Rick a Pro?
Brilliant absolutely brilliant 👏
I understand why Poults had his kids caddie for him. He’s a caddie playing golfer. What a gem.
Ian’s smirk says alot 🤬🤬🤬
I liked how Poulter kept giving really subtle hints/tips (especially the first 45 minutes or so), he'd make a brief comment about it, Rick would do his shot, then I'd think.. ayy.. if only he listened to poulter :D
Next video should be “can I beat Jimmy bulllard if I start 10 under par”
I smashed the like and I think I cracked the screen.
Awesome video and best guest ever
Absolutely loved this video and the genuine Poults shining through on Camera. Big thanks.
Best guest you've had on he was awesome what a Guuy
Great video to watch but the adverts completely spoilt it for me. I accept its subcription for you but it broke the flow of such an exciting match
Great match and Ian is awesome. Note for the future though, if Ian Poulter gives you a 1 in 20 chance of hitting a shot, maybe choose another one. 😂
Rick should play against Phil Mickelson
Fantastic. Postman is obviously past his best, but what an ambassador for the game for young people. Down to earth, real gentleman. Family man. The guy really is a shining example to some of these would be sport stars.
Course looks so cool with all the trees
275 is the runout and Rick pulls out driver on 17 😂 some of the shot decisions were crazy but very entertaining
wow,  2 hours gone so fast, thank you, that was very entertaining :)
Ian is the absolute best!  Great sense of humor. Awesome match!
Absolute class, Ian!
Ian’s belly laugh at Rick’s bounce into the fairway was so wholesome.
hard not to like Ian in this one
Fancy seeing him on yuotube instead of striding around  a Ryder cup match as if he owned the place. Not quite the same. He's got loads o' money anyway.
Ian was such a nice guy here and so supportive during the round!
Poulter the wuss.
That was amazing to watch. I thought you had that last put. As you said, Ian is a fantastic guy. Well done.
Really enjoyed this, the commentary from Ian was fantastic!  Rick was his usual entertaining self.  Well done guys!
Sorry Rick
Best pro colab yet!!!
Should Rick’s Saudi connections be a discussion?
Hands down has to be one of the best videos on your channel! Ian was incredible to watch, but more so with is insight into each of his and your shots. Listening to the mind of a tour pro is next level with his thought process. My wife and I went back today to re-watch the second 9, it was an awesome finish for both of you! Can't wait for the next in this series.
Have you noticed Ian Poulter thinks a lot about the course, his course management and the conditions almost no reference to his swing or swing mechanics - wow. Yet another new lightbulb approach for me to try and further clutter my mind!
Amazing video, the part where Rick smashes the ball of the tree on the 17th, hops back in the cart and drives off  vertical across the fairway killed me though 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love Ian even more now. What a bro.
Best 10-shot challenge yet. Poulter gave an on-course lesson in course management and strategy. Epic!
This was the best guest ever!!!!!! I was riveted to every shot! What a stud, and great guy!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
1:12:25 lol
Ian has been the most fun pro you've had on. Seems like you both genuinely had a good time and made it the most entertaining for the viewers!
Just got to say as well try getting Ian poulter on again for a other challenge of some kind just talks to everyone and helps the way he tells what’s going on great episode
That last tree shank. Had us all laughing hard lol!!!
Ian is absolute class. His short game is phenomenal 😎👊👌
Love to see Ian and Rick play together !
Great 10 shot challenge, on a tight course with a class act in Ian Poulter. My favourite 10 shot challenge video so far! Possibly my favourite ever.
Top man poults,  proper down to earth bloke.
What a nice gentleman,best ever.
Audio is horrendous, unwatchable
This video is honestly the best golf YouTube video about. 99/100  1 mark off for saying Damn in an American accent several times 😂
rick with all due respect mate, you have the game of 8-10 handicap golfer lool
Rick: "How far did you say it was?" Ian: "Not that club in your hand."
What a top bloke!
What an amazing video! Poulter seems like a random guy you could meet on the course one day and become fast friends with, just a legend!
This was an awesome video. The fact that we were able to see Ian in this light was great. He’s one of us. A regular guy but a really great golfer. Love it.
Proper good entertainment, and what an awesome guest...the postman delivers in many different ways
Fantastic as always. Ian is every bit a gent and a genuine pleasure to watch. Well done Rick!
Amazing video! I like every minute of it! Well done. Thanks Rick, thanks Ian! ❤
What a fantastic watch. Best 10 shot challenge yet! Keep up the phenomenal content!
Great video. Poulter a great guest
What a course every hole a picture fairways mowed to perfection stunning
Stick to teaching rick that’s what we subscribe for not to see you play top players and courses.
What a legend that man Poulter is…. So interesting with his thoughts, so tolerant of your decision making and absolutely brilliant on camera… bring on Stenson
Superb one of my favourites the postman delivered first class😂
What a video! Such a fun cheeky guy! But man when he had to play.. He played! 🔥
A classic putting lesson from a tour pro!
Nice vlog showing us anther side of Ian Poulter, wich is very sympathic.I will watch him in the futur with another look. Thanks 👍👍
Back-hole-nine Rick! What a great finish!
Easily the best of these challenges so far. What a nice guy Ian Poulter is, and so interesting to hear how he navigates round the course.
Please just play Ian every week for 10 under par, great banter, great laugh and very enjoyable to watch.
Best one yet Rick. What an all round solid human being Ian is.
Poulter seems like a helluva guy. I really enjoyed his commentary throughout the round.
Great episode. Very interesting to hear his thought process
Ian has been your most entertaining guest to date! Wonderful personality and showed why he is one of the best match play players, he just flicked it on like a light! Awesome content Rick!
This was the best one so far
You should get a rory mcilroy on your channel
Thoroughly enjoyed that one 👏🏻 Poults is legend
What a great video 😮
Is it possible to "like" a video more than one time? I would hit the like button all day long  :-)))
Best one of these by far. And that ending, omg.
Brilliant content as always. Extremely tickled by the fact Ive never heard rick use the word ‘hooded’ before, ian uses it and its now new shiels vocabulary 😂
these videos are so cool!! being able to hear what the pro is thinking like that is special thanks for the content Rick!!
Absolutely brilliant, he really was too nice to you, great guy. Westwood would have been brutal 😂
Best guest so far .. it is both funny and informative having the oppt to listen to a top pro courss mgt..enjoy it thoroughly..
Just brilliant! I liked Poulter before, love him now.
Ian Poulter was a man I used to enjoy to dislike, now I hate how much I like him. What a great fun game you guys played.👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
14:14 “I’m very in-tree-gued to know what you’re gonna do here” 😂😂😂
The ONE Tour Pro I'd love to play with and have a BBQ with afterwards. 💪🏻
This was my favorite of the pros
Seen Ian Poulter at Victoria golf club driving range  in melbourne  for the final round of the 2010 or 2011 Australian Masters and he was so arrogant towards the spectators and then again in Queensland at the PGA championship  AND again no interactions ,but watching him play with Rick seems human!!!! Great video loved it
The last approach shot had to replay that 10 times😮
Man, putter to the ankle is the absolute worst. It's amazing how such a light tap can hurt so bad 😂😂😂 56:06
I love that he joked with you, laughed AT you… and had fun with the day 😃🙌🏼
I for sure thought rickie was the best how he opened up more through the back nine, but after watching this Ian was by far the best guest. He made it seem like just a round with the boys
All the guests have been great but by far this was the most entertaining video! Great job guys. Ian was such a great sport and watching his thought process and keeping it light while Rick was foraging in the trees was fun to watch. Easily one of the best videos in a long while. Will probably give this one another re-watch at some point.
Ian is such a class act. Although he is in a match with you, he helps you whenever he can. Obviously, he is a true gentleman!
Respect to the postman! I really enjoyed Ian's commentary on his thought processes and his advice. On par with Lee and Ricky.
Quick request would you review the 2023 calloway great big bertha irons they're supposed to be revolutionary irons using driver materials giving way more forgiveness than ever before while being crazy long I'd love to hear your opinion
Such a top bloke, he was a great pod and an even better match 👏
Rick shiels lubing up watching Ryder cup
This was fantastic. The editing team are really stepping up and presenting this content really well
Poults is just an all round class guy. Not the most naturally gifted golfer, but worked his arse off to get to where he has. A real role model to anyone trying to make it in golf. Proper legend.
Very nice video, and I absolutely love Ian! Could the next guest be Ian's good friend Stenson?
Poults is a ledge, proper top bloke.
Ian  Poulter what a player , gentleman and also so funny ! You were so unlucky not to win. If only for the first couple of holes . One of the best vids yet!👏👏👏👏
Best guest by far, at the beginning I couldn't tell if he was into it or not, but what an engaging dude!
BEST. VIDEO. YET.  wouldn't mind some IP head covers😎
😊 love Ian poulter
Incredible video.  Really insightful even as a newcomer to golf.  Hearing Ian's thought process and his banter made for an exciting watch.  Even my better half was glued and she is sick if all the golf I watch.
Always been a fan of Ian Poulter but like him a bit more now… absolutely brilliant content.. definitely get him back on the channel.. maybe a 10 under Texas scramble.. well played some great shots…
Please can you start doing What’s in the bag as a part of the video with all the pros you play with.  Thanks
Would be a dream to see you meet Henrik Stenson ⛳️ wow
Ian Poulter is now my favorite tour pro. Please invite him back on! 🙏
Anyone else get the impression Ian new exactly which way the whole game would go? Match play on the last and finishing a very modest even Par but most importantly with the win. Very gentlemanly Mr Poulter! 😉 Very enjoyable bit of content. Loved it!
Just lost a subscriber. You just sold out to LIV.  Sad Rick.  Just sad
The best video ever. Congrats to both of you. Poults continues to be a legend!!👏👏
That was a great video, Ian was brilliant, so helpful and entertaining. Well done Rick, best pro yet......
Ian is the cleanest golfer on the planet. He's constantly wiping off club heads and his ball.
How he vocalizes his process for each shot, his candor on bad shots, the way he plays to the camera, Ian is far and away the best guest for this challenge. Super entertaining and the golf was very relatable for the majority of us.
Ian is a true golf professional, his knowledge of always playing for the next shot was amazing, great show guys.
Ian has been your best guest by far pal..what a gent!
Best one so far! Loved it. 🎉
What a great video!
Two huge personalities, and the chemistry was amazing!  The energy over the entire two hour match was like watching a nail biting action movie. Just outstanding!
This was the best one so far. Ian was great!
That was the best yet Ian is a legend. Great to hear how he weighs up the shots and then does what he says he is going to do. Would love to see a rematch.
1:15:18 Rick with a 5 shot buffer tries to play the hero shot. Entertainment value 10/10. Course Management 0/10
Maybe a not so hot take here: Rick is not very good at golf
How much PIF money is now flowing into the Shields golf company? 🧐
Rick you TALK TOOOO MUCH IT interferes with the game
Ian is such a cool guy. I grew up watching him play. Amazing video!
I love Ian's attitude... "just in the middle of those trees where you don't want to be... chuckle".
I've never really been a Poulter fan, but I am now. Pro golfers need to learn from this. Showing your personality, being genuine will get more fans than you'd ever know!
By far the best one so far! Ian is a true legend of the game and what a guy he seems to be. Would love to play 18 with him… ❤
That was a great watch, and what a beautiful golf course!
Great video. Poulter is a class guy
The best 10 shot challenge yet! Ian Poulter was phenomenal in this video.
Best one yet! Love ian. Maybe i have a new fav pro player
Fantastic video! I must admit I have never been a Poulter fan, except during the Ryder Cup of course, but he won me over here. Thoroughly enjoyed listening to his thought processes and his genuine appreciation of your good shots. Up there with the Westwood match for me!
This was so nice to watch. Ian losing it after Rick's errant shot on 17 was the highlight for me. Absolute comedy, and we've all felt that pain before 😂.
the absolute immaculate perfect dap after the last putt on 18th is underrated.
Rick missed such a good chance at the end of the video, saying it was "epic." he should have said "majestic," would have liked to see Ian's face if he said that. Absolutely amazing video
Time for a new driver Rick!
He understood the assignment. 💯🏌️
The comments say it all, I came here to pay my dues, Ian poulter was a great guest and I'm enjoying the show very much, thanks Rick. Keep up them double bogies!! 😉🫡.      P.s rick Also you need to herass these pros more and just do these -10 match plays with tour pros. Best golf on YouTube.. much love
Absolutely brilliant video one of the best ever, Ian was a pleasure to listen too, the detail and help he gave Rick was great to see and a great to learn from for us amateurs. The constant cleaning of clubs and the putter shows just the lengths they go too for perfect contact at all times and then at the very end to switch it on was majestic! in its self
Ian Poulter comes off as a super great guy! I live 5 minutes from medinah and I remember what he did to us, but he sure is a good bloke!!
How many Americans are now fans of Ian Poulter thanks to this?!
What a video Rick! Ian is the man.
Well played Rick great match Ian what a gentleman and a true feeling professional love his thought processes on each shot lucky enough to follow him around the LIV golf Adelaide in April this year a real peoples player and a good bloke..
Rick let’s face it you need to drop the tag PGA Pro!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRsS178z70Q
another great vid! im sucked in, come to Australia and give me 30 shots rick :P
Absolutely briliant Rick and team. Ian was a excellent - funny, down to earth and a great laugh. Loved his explanations as he went through his pre-shot routine. Superb stuff.
the best video I've seen rick that was absolutely brilliant ian was gold two hours of the best entertainment must get ian back on again thanks boys
What a top bloke ian poulter really is. To give Rick and us watching the time and insight into his game. You can see why he’s such a good team player
What a top man Ian is, great insight and good company. Whether you are for or against LIV we need him as a future European Captain
Poulter is a Ryder cup legend . Ricks problems are between his ears . Does he properly warm up before starting . He gives 4 shots away in the first 2 holes almost every time . Get your short game sorted and see a sports psychologist. Believe in yourself
I could feel Rick’s pain on the short eagle putt on 5
Great commentary- good example of what we love from the pros
By far one of the best videos Rick has ever released! Fantastic to watch. Thx Rick!
By far one of the best videos Rick has ever released! Fantastic to watch. Thx Rick!
I flat out enjoyed this. Thank you guys!
The Mailman alway delivers!!
I was Jose Buzingwa for this one and it didn’t disappoint. Best yet ⛳️. Tiger next 👀
Thanks to Ian Poulter, this is the best episode so far and the one to compete with in the future. Most likely, this will always be the best episode. What an enjoyable and nice person, a true gentleman with a loveable sense of humour!!!! Great stuff, Rick!!!!
This was brilliant!
That was a great watch!
Him coming on here feels... sports wash-y
epic!!
Only 15 seconds in... if the course is as tight and tree lined as the background on your intro, youre totally screwed! 20 strokes wouldnt save you. Now to watch and see what happens
Rick has gotten wayyy worse the past year or so. Wonder what’s going on.
Great video and wonderful advice from Ian Poulter during the round, unfortunately spoilt by the constant lengthy ad breaks.
Ian is a legend! Great Vid, thanks!
I love watching your vids, but there are becoming more and more adverts. Getting quite frustrating.  @RickShielsPGA
I remember being 15 years old walking into his 12+ car garage and just being blown outta my mind
Thanks for this episode, really enjoy this format, and as other comments have said Ian was a little intimidating but a great guest and his attention to detail, breeze , line etc was very interesting. Clearly nerves, quite understandably, got the better of Rick at the start however to make the clutch putt on 17 was class. Just slight misjudgement on spin on 18 otherwise creditable draw was on the cards. Look forward to the Stenson match!
That was awesome , and you both didn’t have your A games. Loved it 👍🏻 Poulter was a fantastic guest and really engaging
What a great video. Shame it’s only 2 hrs long. I could watch another 2hrs! Ian is such a great bloke. Top content.
Great to watch thankyou
What a class gentleman.
Brilliant
Best video ever, who needs TV
Thanks Rick, great game, great guest and great production!! Keep it going!! Tiger next pse....
Fair play, he was the best opponent so far. What a guy!
If Ian decides to quit professional golf you should hire him full time to your chanel
Thanks
What a great video it’s taking me the whole weekend to watch it but it was well worth it. Ian was on par ( pun intended ). Great watch keep up the great work 👍🏌️
I like Ian…
What a video! Best 10 shot challenge so far.   I have even more respect for Poulter now than I did before. What a great guy.
When I hit the shot at 44:03, everyone around me scatters to hide behind things in fear of the inevitable ricochet when I miss 😅
Ian Poulter was one of my favourite tour players. He now is my favourite. Best 10mshit challenge yet
How about Rick vs jimmy bullard? That wud be an awesome match!!!
Ian is a very great player and gentleman
Rick I think it’s the nerves! You play so well during your normal stress free matches
Have to agree that this is one of the best 10 shot challenges, I watch full swing on Netflix & the episode with Ian was really good, came across as a very genuine guy & your video proves it. He's a legend.  Any chance of challenging a left handed player Rick, I'm a lefty & quite new to golf, could really use some good advice🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
Absolutely the best guest ever, such fun and authenticity
I can’t stand Poulter 💩💩!
Top bloke!!! On to the next video tubes and ange
Loved this! Ian's cheeky asides to camera when Rick was about to play a crazy shot were absolute gold. He was very generous with his comments and advice, but damn he wanted to win too. Best 10 stroke challenge yet.
Best 10 under yet! Postman is a legend
Great video and a great match. Rick nearly gave it away after the first 2 holes but he dug in and battled well. Poults is a classy golfer and Woburn looked mint. I bet before the video he said to Rick don't mention Liv 😂
What a great bloke Ian Poulter is, brilliant!
Ian Poulter is friendly to Rick, but at the end he is still a fierce competitor like he is in the Ryder Cup. Really enjoyed this!!!
what an amazing bloke ian is , was already in my fourball for life pick and this is why , stellar golf amazing insight and can still have a laugh . We all need more poults in our lives :)
The biggest compliment I can give this video and Ian Poulter is I originally adored him after his European Tour and especially Ryder Cup exploits which were obliterated by his “defection” (in my humble opinion) to the LIV bandwagon and it’s £££ BUT….. after watching this video, I am really struggling to not like him again. 😔👏👏
1:42:56 is the funniest shot of the day
The pro's are so so good at getting out of trouble
Best video in this series by far!
How much did Ian eat on the way around haha
Best guest ever. Ian Poulter was brilliant, sharing his thought process was awesome. Loved how he gave Rick yardages and lines and was super helpful. I am now a Poulter fan.
Great vid Rick, thank you. Bad luck on just missing that last putt.  I'd have to say I was impressed with Ian's attitude throughout. Many perceive him as being quite a self centered guy but his generosity with tips and advice was very decent and professional of him. Great sense of humour too, obviously with some 'get in your head ' banter thrown in.
Why not playing intelligent ?😂
What an amazing video. Thank you 😊
Rematch!!
The difference in tempo between Ian and Rick is huge. Ian hits it a mile and where he wants with a smooth tempo, whereas Rick looks very wristy on the way back and much quicker and snappier and the ball is all over the place. I reckon if Rick slowed his tempo and had a more fluid swing he would be an absolute force. His practice swings always look smooth and amazing but then the actual shot is far from it. Hes obvs got a lot of skill just think his tempo is absolutely killing his game
As much as I hate Ian Poulter because I'm American, I have always respected him as a player. The guy has ice in his veins when it comes to Ryder Cup. And he seems like a stand up guy.
By far the best video you’ve posted. Smiled all the way through it!
This is definitely the best -10 video you've ever done. Ian is such a generous Legend.  It's also pretty obvious he really enjoyed it as well. I'm pretty sure he'd be well up for doing some more challenges with you. 😊
Didn’t really know Ian up until I saw the full swing series plus this video the lad is an absolute stud seem super genuine with a great sense of humor absolutely solid content
Thank you Ian, really enjoyable
ian is great on tv .
Hey Rick, been following for a couple of years, and have to sat its been hard watching some of your games. But truth be known I'm no better, however know you are. I haven't commented before, but this video with Ian, I felt i had to comment. I felt the whole animosity to players over there LIV participation uncalled for, they are looking out for their futures in their chosen careers. I loved Ian's contributing of time, support and encouragement to your channel, shows to me its not about the money. My esteem of the guy has only growen. Great result, although to be honest never in doubt, lovely match to watch, IMHO the best yet. Thank you both Ian and Rich. Nice one.
What a superb video. Brilliant work by both of you, best two hours of content I’ve watched in a long time
Rick, we don’t need you to play great golf to enjoy the content, having great guest like Ian is the key 😉
Lot of practice from under the trees😂
I can remember when i first started playing golf around 35 years ago i watched Faldo all the time, loads of instruction videos etc. the thing i always remember is when he said Course Management is about 90% of his game. Again Poulter shows just how important it is. Talk of dropping down a club as he knows he will get too much spin, downhill slope shots and flyers mean coming down a club, his thought process through every shot is fantastic for people of all standards of golf.  Really enjoyed this Rick. thanks to you both. Did anyone else as well as Rick notice the moment Ian went from going out to play a round of golf with Rick to the (I am winning this) Attitude. Top stuff.
Poults is just class ain’t he. Now to be fair Rick I think you dragged him down to your level 😂 but all in all it was great content. Your next opponent if possible should be Tyrell Hatton I think that would provide your best content yet 👍🏻
The way he talked through shots and gave advice was brilliant. Genuinely seemed to really enjoy himself. Jumped off my seat on the last when i thought you had holed your 2nd Rick!
Great game and "what a nice bloke IP is" 👍
Love your videos mate but wow u need to do some practice
A great watch guys 👍
Some video ❤
This was so great, loved the little looks and comments to the camera from Ian, a natural performer. More respect now for Ian as an all round good guy after watching. Well done Rick. Bring on Henrick 🤣
What a fantastic video, great chemistry between the two of you and what a great guy Ian is.
Great video. Politer seems such a nice guy, nice one
Really enjoyable seeing both of you playing a very difficult but beautiful course, great entertainment, and👏👍
I knew he was going to say Henrik 😄
Poulter was such great character great video and next challenge maybe victor Hovland .
Without Ian's help this match would have been over for Rick long before the 18th because he would have been too many shots behind . In the last few holes Ian just stepped up a gear or two but overall this was a brilliant game
What a match. Great fun, good job Rick. Lol that twirl on the 18th tee from Rick though 👌 😅😅😅😅😂
Best pro vid yet Rick 🎉
What a video, what a match!
Great video. I was really getting into this, the finish was so exciting- what a competition it was - Ian Poulter was really into it towards the end!
What a beautiful golf course.
Took me all weekend to watch but what an epic vid & match 👍
Rick, have you considered getting a 10 handicap? Only kidding. Another great video from the series.
This was epic! What a guy Ian is.
That was awesome, love Ian
Poults is a legend 👊🏻
Great Guy, sounds a lot like Conor Moore.🤣🤣
What a legend, enjoyed that one the best out of all the others. Decent nice bloke. Great content Rick
Subtle mind games from poulter on the first tee, matchplay masterclass
Loves these matches.
One of the very best video ever watched on your channel Rick.  enjoyed every single minute. Absolutely class act from Mr. Poulter. What a phenomenal gentleman he is 🙌🏼
Just a pity he's a gooner!!
That was brilliant ! No other word needed.
If you haven’t grown up watching Poulter, you’ve missed out. An absolute legend, character and clutch Ryder cup player. One of the best videos. Even though he didn’t play well here, he still had a great time you could see
Never been a poulter fan but what a sound bloke
Ian Poulter has been one of my favorites since I got into golf back in 2002. I’ve always loved his bold fashions, his competitiveness and how he just seems like an all-around good guy. I’m an even bigger fan after watching this and the podcast. It was an amazing finish and really fun to see the beast come out in Ian at the end. I did expect a bit more Lee Westwood style head games and banter for some reason, but an incredible performance by Rick and Ian nonetheless. There may be a rematch needed on this one!
Absolutely fantastic video Rick, great great content 🎉 The PGA Tour has so much to learn from...
Ian, absolute gentleman, fantastic guys
Poulter..what a great person and golfer, would love to see him play live. Great video Rick. Unlucky Rick maybe next time.
One of these times you’ll play one of these big names and your arse won’t be making buttons at the start. Maybe rattle a few halfs down your neck before you tee off?
That would be the best 'Can I beat a tour pro' episode I have watched. Most informative and interesting game. Ian is a champion, so open and informative. We need more like this, well done.
Im usually rooting for Rick on these challenges but today found myself pulling for Ian.  Seems like class guy.
A great video and follow up to the podcast! Ian came across brilliantly in both and earnt a new fan.
Best one yet. 👌
I was not a huge Ian Poulter fan because he breaks American hearts in the Ryder Cup. This video made me a huge fan of his. What a great guy! Loved hearing his thought process on each shot.
Golden! Thanks Ian & Rick. Best one yet.
The trash talk behind ricks back to the camera was freekin hilarious
Best you tube golf video to date on any channel or platform!
Competitive!
Slick dude. 👍🏼
Top bloke poulter and great player..an awesome match 👍👏👏
Credit to the player camera on Poults and capturing his good naturedness. I'm a renewed Poulter fan. Thank you Rick.
Genuinely the best 10 shot challenge video yet, possibly the best video on the channel. Great work from Rick, Ian, and the whole team
This video was honestly the best of the 10 shot challenge series so far! Hilarious and intense all in one!
I think that was the best Rick Shiels video I have ever seen!!!
Thoroughly enjoyed this video, Poults has always been one of my favourite golfers and he didn’t disappoint! Loved the way he talked through every shot and the guidance he gave to you Rick, this is what golf is all about. What an absolute gentleman.
Bro these Brit’s and European people can’t even pump their chest without crying… America!
Maybe at 3M subs Rick will finally buy good mics
Absolutely enjoyed it; your best guest so far
59:12 Ian’s face 😂😂
Great stuff!  Have always been a fan of Poulter and it was great to see his shot creativity and down to Earth demeanor in this video.  Please have him on as a guest again.  Maybe a 2v2 with you and Ian matched up against Peter Finch and Tommy Fleetwood!  Cheers!
great match and video.  Thank you
awesome video rick really enjoyed it, keep them coming!
This one is my favourite since Westy. I don’t know if better because I’m a softie for LW but Ian is a class act
Please do as many videos as you can with Ian Poulter
My feelings about LIV will not permit me to watch this episode.  Good luck.
Just fantastic. Your wrap up at the end was spot on. Great entertainment for sure, thank you! Looking forward to Henrik Stenson :)
Best tip I picked up is the way Ian constantly has a towel in his hands, cleans everything after every shot, even after a practice swing, a good lesson to us all.
There are too many moments to be specific, but congratulations, Rick, on having the best Golf video on YouTube IMHO.   I have always been a fan of Poults, and this merely enhances that. One can learn so much from this in many ways.
Great video ,absolutely love ian's game and conduct. He's ine of us a normal guy who happens to have a great golf game which he works so hard for❤
Rick:  Your match with Ian was epic.  How Ian thought through each shot, his execution & how he walked Rick through the shot process was fantastic.  This was by far the best 10 shot challenge to date.
What a legend 😅 Top 5 YT vids ever 👏
Ian Poulter is pure Class 👌
I think what I enjoyed most about this video is that you could tell Ian was genuinely rooting for you, but himself just a smidgen 🤏 more 😂
That shot in the woods that came back out middle fairway 😂😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️.  Let’s go Rick
Ian Is  Amazing.  I loved listening to him talk through his thoughts for every shot.  Great man.
Truly epic, one of the best videos and what a guy Ian was 👍
Rick…I took my non-golfing family to the Centurion last Sunday granddaughter got hellos from Phil, Cameron, Sergio and Ian… they want to go next year. Her inflatable golf club goes to bed with her… give LIV a chance. This vlog is by far the best celebrity match I have ever watched including all the Rounds with Peter Alias.  So sad we won’t see Ian at the Ryder Cup  Thanks a million
I actually felt  I was watching a classic Ryder cup battle, what a gentleman Ian is, thanks goes to Rick and the team, great entertainment !! 😊
This is why YouTube is the future - amazing content and editing better than what’s on tv ! Thanks Rick and Ian
This looks like a really tough course.  Tight fairways on most tee shots, then a small area of rough and finally, tons and tons of trees and thicket line both sides of about every hole.  Make sure you have plenty of golf balls when playing this course.   All the holes here are very well protected and provide plenty of obstacles.
What a great video. Ian was fantastic on camera. It was fun to watch and you both looked like you really enjoyed it.
Please do another round with Ian. Absolutely fantastic.
Fantastic by Ian this because there’s so much for us to learn from their considerations before a shot
Just Wow.
You make us mid handicapers feel good. Even I can see your bad swings are far too quick.
As allways, two holes and… 😂🎉
That synced up club pull on nine was sexy
Ian talking with a mouthful of snacks after the turn 😂
Great video! Always been a huge fan of Ian Poulter and it was great to see him being so generous with advice. Keep up the good work guys, love the content.
Poults is an absolute legend and a Gooner to boot! Top man and a real gent. No taking the pee out of your odd bad shots like some others I could mention in this series.
I love all of your videos Rick but this one was different. I haven’t really seen or watched much of Ian before but I’m happy I stuck around for this whole video. I enjoyed watching him go through his thought process for your shots and his shots. He was a great and fun guest! Hopefully he can join the channel again soon!
This is the best series on the channel. I can’t wait for the next!
Awesome video!!! One of your very best Rick.
This is the best one ever great video
This one was the most fun!
best shiels vid ever
Ian was fantastic and that match was one for the ages.
Way too many commercials, Rick. Every time I get into the match there’s another commercial.
Great video Rick!  Ian was a phenomenal guest👍💯
Wonderful match!  Hope there's a rematch in the future.  Very enjoyable.
Just wow! Best yet! Can't type, just amazing.
What a lovely bloke Poulter is. Great viewing.
Great content, this!  Ian Poulter is a great golf partner, through and through.
Great watch, Rick and Ian. The Ryder Cup will not be the same without the Majestics, their loss. Thanks Ian, your one of the gentlemen of the game pity the PGA, and DP doesn't see it that way. Tez from Oz
Wow I mean experience is everything the way Ian talked through the shots explained the holes the ease he had with the repoire. As much as Ian has beaten us in the Ryder cups 😢 I’m a golf fan since him moving to Liv the Netflix documentary I have a huge huge amount of respect for him the way he seems to father husband and golf on the highest level for 20 years mad mad love for him great video one of my fav ever .. Oh yea great Job Rick love your 10 under Series
Without a doubt my favourite rick video! Always liked poulter but it was absolutely unreal to see him like this! What a man and what a match
Love it when Ian breaks the 4th wall and chuckles at the camera.
The production quality is top notch.  Long as a movie but more entertaining than one.  So thankful for you and Ian for putting on a show and your team for putting it all together.  I always had a neutral to negative impression of Ian but this show changed my mind.  He's such a great teacher.
Man I’ve always like Poulter but this video made me like him even more. Seems so cool.
Awesome Poults tough course The Duke’s 😮
yes
Congrats, that was a lot of fun to watch, total enjoyment.
Poults is a legend!!!  What an awesome guest to have on the channel.
I'm going with, "Yes you can", on this one before watching.....I'm giving you 75-77, net 65-67, and Ian shoots 68/69.  Will edit after the watch. Edit:  ok so numbers were off, and outcome prediction- wrong. Woburn is a beautiful beast- those trees are beauty and the beast.  It seems long enough to require the driver, when a long iron/hybrid would ensure more fairways (sometimes damnit), but require long 2nd shots.  But those trees often, aside from the 3-iron chip slice, which is not in my locker, require a punch out, so it's taking me 3 to get on anyway. This, Rick, was a load of fun to watch, and I'm glad to see this side of Ian...he seems quite a cool dude.  That makes two of you; thanks for the great watch!
What an absolute legend Ian was. Loved this vid. 🤙🏽
One of my favorite golf personalities and I’m American and love his style and swagger
Jon Rahm!  Amazing video as always. I can't help but like Ian Poulter more and more. Stand up gentleman, great sense of humor, amazing talent.   Thanks!
Is it just me or has Rick’s game been truly off lately. He was a good driver of the ball but seems to have trouble even hitting it straight.
Ian Freaking Poulter. Absolutely the best guest ever. Knowledgeable, professional, gracious, and having a bit of a poke at Rick like he would an equal or a dear friend. Great entertainment.  I have been a fan of Ian for a long time, but this guarantees I will pull for him even during the Ryder Cup vs the Red White and Blue of my home. Awesome job!
Rick is awful and it’s hilarious.
That was extraordinarily entertaining. Loved all the pre shot discussions that gave us all an insight as to how the pros go about their business. Ian was just great and such natural charisma. No wonder why he’s adored on tour and especially team events. His facial impressions were priceless. I honestly thought you were going to stick that shot on 18 Rick…close but no cigar. Cheers to a great match 👏 👏 👏
Since show Full Swing total respect for Ian. This video is just other example of how much Ian is a great man.
Ian Poulter is a true legend. Love his energy.
Such a great match, the chemistry between the 2 of you in this video was on point
That was a lot of fun!
Enjoyed the golf , the golf course , and Poulter .
for 2 guys why say they are playing like shit, I wish i could play like that on a good day 😅
Ian is such a class act and beautiful swinger of the club. Also, I believe the best Ryder Cup Player ever!  Really enjoy watching these 10 shot Tour Player challenges. Rick please keep them coming and may God Bless you both.
is rick using his american accent on the DAMN after the shot on 17 lol?!?
This opening tee shot was priceless
‘Rip spin back 20ft’  Rick: 👀👀👀
What a video! That was epic fun
Best challenge so far!  Thank you!! Just bloody amazing and fun to watch!
Rick, another classic,  but it's time to ditch that driver!!!
Ian gained a fan here. class act!
what a video!
Honestly of all the players you have played with and against I would have to say that he is one of the best all around “good guys”! He’s not just funny but he is a true professional!
Ian would make a great Ryder Cup Captain
Love this series, would love to see match play! Maybe Rick gets a half a shot per hole?
What’s with ricks ‘damn’ all video
Ian poulter is just a genuinely fun guy
What a genuine guy being a full time tournament pro. This had my heart beating out my chest like watching the masters on 18. Ian what a pleasure to watch!
That last hole was FIRE!
Epic match, thoroughly enjoyed the chemistry. Well done mates.
Ricks tempo is terrible
Best video yet. Ian is terrific in this kind of format.
Stopped watching after 2nd tee ball. Horrible play.
Wow!!!! Brilliant. Best thing I’ve watched this year. Both Ian & Rick top class…..and huge shout out to the camera, video team for putting this together - huge TEAM effort.   I would love to see Rory on this one day!
That was fantastic! IP was so much fun to watch!
South Texas demands a Rematch! Christmas Special!! C’mon, Rick!
I just can’t watch the horrendous golf for this long if Rick was an actual single digit handicap this could be watchable. But everyone knows he’s realistically a 80s golfer.
Ian’s shoes. So f’n slick. 🔥🔥🔥🔥
“He’s not got this one” absolute classic from poulter 😂
LOVE THESE!!!!! Could be the best outing yet!
That was an absolute pleasure to watch!  Very entertaining as well, with all the "lucky" shots out of the woods!!!
Ian's looks at the camera. Brilliant
What a fantastic video, couldn't have planned for a better final hole!
That’s a beautiful course
G430 sounds like a winner.
Big Ian fan after this!!!! Great stufffff!!!!
The camera work, the rivalry, and story line was all so fun to watch...and gained a new respect for Poulter, really entertaining!
POULTER = TRAITOR !!!
Ian and Guy vs.......Rick and Iona.  Do it.
IJP for President!!!
Great vid. Your mic is a little muddy though.
Ian is the man 🎉
Ian is definitely my favorite guest out of all of these. Pure class, this guy. I was cracking up when you hit that tree on the 17th, and he covers his mouth to hide his cracking up Hahaha
poulterhe has the new titleist irons
Great video Rick, I’ve always liked Ian and rooted for him because he is such a great competitor and I’m American so you know he has broken your hearts lots of times.  Highest class of a man, this has been my favorite video so far and I’ve watched for years.  I will watch this back because it was so good 😊 great job again Rick as always, your number one my friend!
Loved the talk and thought process from Ian, well done by both great game. 🤛
I have never warmed to Poulter. My opinion has changed massively - what a gentleman. Great video and what a stunning course.
To be an elite level athlete, you need a level of competitiveness that it’s actually kind of unhealthy.
Dude this is so awesome. I wish more pros would share their tips.
Rick, where did you get the hat in this episode, I'd like to get one, thanks!!!
Rick never fails to display how he truly is a back 9 player
Great match! Is it just me or does every hole on that course look the exact same?
Never a doubt
Rick is one of us @1:42:45 😅
Mr Poulter is a good guy...thanks for bringing us the human side of all these great pros.
Awesome video Rick
Absolute gentleman is Ian. Fun to watch and educational. Bravo to you both!
He was great on camera. That was fun to watch.
Until recently I only knew Ian Poulter by name and his golfer reputation.  Then I saw him on the Netflix show and was very impressed with his heart-warming dedication to family.  Then I saw your long-form interview with him and became even more impressed with him as a person.  This video sealed the deal.  I'm now a HUGE Ian Poulter fan.  As a golfer, as a family man, and as an incredibly good man generally.  I've been teaching a grandson to play golf (he's really good) and I've been stressing that it's not good enough to be a good golfer.  I've said he needs to be the partner everyone wants to play with.  Ian absolutely demonstrated that in every respect.
That was extremely wonderful. Ian is the consummate pro and overall class act!  Best to you both. What an experience watching you two legends!
Master class
What a top bloke, he's grown on me over the last year's and since LIV and this video, I'm a major fan 👌
That course looks really challenging!
Ricks driver sound is awful! Is that a ping?
What a finish
Amazing see the joy in the game we love. A+
What’s Rick’s cap? Double digits I’m assuming. Needs to improve for better viewing but love the concept!
Ian Poulter what a guy. My favourite Ryder Cup player.
These matches make me realize. Pros on their worst day can shoot better than me with 10 shots. But on their best day, I won’t have a chance of beating them.
I can’t believe you left an eagle putt short
Rick, Rick, Rick…….your rushing. Slow and steady mate.  Really great content. I love these challenges. To be honest I could start 20 under and Rick would kick my butt.  Cheers
56:21 I do that all the time it sucks it always hurts way more then I think it should
Great watch. I do think that one hook shot which resulted in a.double was an unnecessary risk.
Seeing top awesome players play a challenging tree lined forest course and hit phenomenal shots from in/under trees is just next level!  Yea seeing brilliant players in a wipe open field is something, but seeing shots from under or behind trees and still walking off with pars and berdies without breaking a sweat is mental! I'd struggle to break 130 on that course 🤣
Terrific!  Very entertaining.  It was like 2 best friends playing their best round of golf ever together and loving every minute of it.
Ok. I'm here on the 13th hole and I have it paused when Rick is deciding to hit this absolutely stupid hook shot out of the left rough. I'm not sure what's going through his mind here. If he misses this in the slightest it's a double bogey at least. He's up 5 and can afford a bogey but still has a good chance at par.
Great challenge as always! Can you plz just check audio levels before you start filming these Shielsy? My speakers are crackling so much it sounds like fireworks when you guys speak 😛
What Great fun ! ... Ian, what a solid guy , Thank you both
Best Guest 100%
beautiful course, intimidating tee shots
How can I give 10 likes to this? hahaha =D Poulter is a genius
Aww heck, Ian is a jolly well good sport, innit?
I was really against this video when I heard it announced as I was anti liv but watching this I’m learning to separate the golfers from liv And Ian was a top Man to play with you and he has gone up in my books
Best -10 under challenge yet.Hats off to you Rick for getting these wonderful Pros out to play. So nice to see these pros as one of the guys.   Ian you are a gentleman. I took notice of you looking skyward checking the wind in the trees before each shot.  You were amazing!!! Rick keep doing what you’re doing.   Love it!!!!
Whenever you hear rick say i want to hit a hard cut you just know the next words will be ‘not that hard’ 😂
ian was the best you’ve had so far with these challenges. MAN i wanted you to win so bad. i can guarantee you will beat the next tour pro
Fantastic content!
No sausage roll review.  6 out of 10
Notice Rick not picking up Ian's towel on the par 3.... walked right by it 😂😂😂
I feel a lot better about my 9 hole game today.
when you have a bad hole, leave it at that hole my friend. Trust me it wont help to bring up on the next one how that last one was. Be positive, it does help    great video keep them coming!
The realistic , practical and technical tidbits fron Ian on each hole was great to hear. Flowing insights to help Rick attack a pin is Gold! Seeing his reactions reminds me of how great a golf game is. Best video so far!
Brilliant episode. Best one yet.
Great match
As a Yank, I only know Ian as a Ryder Cup villian, from my perspective...but after seeing him in a different light, I can say my perspective has changed.
Best 10 shot challenge yet. Ian is an absolute gentleman.
Great enjoyable video
Rick, you don’t play enough defense, you keep taking driver when there’s no room 😂
Class act Ian Poulter.  Easy to root for when he’s competing.  Great content.
Phenomenal video Rick. Pouts seems like an absolute legend. Love the content.
Ian poulter’s personality surprised me 100%. He seems like a solid dude.
Ian only doing this cos his pr is in the toilet. Poulter, Westwood and MacDowell are in the same boat
That was the most fun I've ever had watching one of these matches.  Ian's comments were absolutely hilarious and his facial responses to some of your shots were even better.....great content.
WHERE ARE THE PLAID PANTS?!
Great chemistry between you both!!!! Really enjoyed that match!
Rick you’ve choked it! 😢This was the most exciting one yet it really came down to the wire! You and Ian have great chemistry on the course.
Can I beat a paper bag if I start out ten shots ahead? 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Gotta find a fix for the slow starts Rick, you gotta! Mental coach ... something.
the most informative 10 stroke challenge yet. Really enjoyed listening to Poult's thought processes as the round went on. A great video Rick
What Rick said in the summary. A great watch!
damn rick you are caked up
This was, by far, one of my fave vids.  Always liked Mr. Poulter.  Great couple hours after a hot round in Northern California today.
Best movie that's been released this summer.
Unbelievable video! Ian seems like such a genuine guy! And the golf course looks amazing!
GReat vid Rick, well done!!
You can tell Poulter has been training his kids because he's really good at breaking down his strategy for us.
So soo goood Rick. Even as an Aussie I love Poults. Bloody fantastic viewing. Well done 👍🙌
Rick! That was awesome! The Best show I've seen on your channel. I never laughed so much or so hard! Ian, I'm a huge fan!
Wow what a video. Loved that from start to finish. Ian is so open and had a lot of time to making this video what it is. Having the chance to listen to a legend in golf talk through his shots was amazing. Rick I honestly thought you had him and he just turned it on in those last few holes.
Interesting, he's playing a PING driver.
The hate this guy gets is rickdickulous, what a proper banter heavy gentleman. This has replaced about 5 other of your videos as my new favourite. Absolutely formidable. 2 hours watching two unreal entertainers, 2 hours well well well spent.
Ian has always been a top guy from years back on Twitter, this has been so entertaining & he should come back. Really enjoyed his insight and comments to camera.
Rick what a awesome golfing.. You know how to entertain use Nice job 👍
Unbelievable video. Such great insight into golf course management and shot making. Poults is a legend and very humble. Amazing. Can’t wait til the next.
To be honest, with the whole LIV thing and some of Ian’s interviews (netflix doc etc), i didn’t really have a great opinion of him. However, after watching this video you can tell he’s a genuine nice bloke and was brilliant throughout the whole video with some good banter and great insight to his thought process through the round. Great video!
It shocks me, Rick is not that much better than an average golfer. Figured he'd be a lot better.
That course is tighter than a nun's particulars
Best one yet …enough said
Absolutely cracking video. Simple as that. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d spend 2 hours on my weekend watching 1 v 1 golf a few years ago.  But here I am… and I love it.
Love the video ❤ any chance you could do a video me a 18 handicap and I start 10 up ! 👍👍👍
Best 10 shot challenge, Ian was the best interacting and helpful Pro you have played even though you were against him. Just watching the way he thinks made me question how I play and what I should be doing to lower my scores.
Never saw Ian Poulter on this kind of golf vid. Great Vid. Ian an Ric is a fun watch
Fantastic video. Ian Poulter and you were a great double-act of comedy gold and brilliant to hear his detailed thoughts all the way through the video.
Best 10 shot challenge yet, Ian Poulter is a class act, exactly as he was on Full Swing. Wonderful how he explained why you should use the hooded 9 iron for the hook between the branches was gold.
Yeah I won’t be watching this one.  Ian’s a tool and I’m sick of him whining for a year straight about the PGA.
If you could put a few more adds in the video Rick that’d be great. Cheers
Absolutely brilliant will forever be my favourite golfer! Great video
Good video Rick, always like these -10 rounds however, would have been great to have heard IP answer questions about his experiences, Ryder cup, zany clothing, LIV, etc.
Ian Poulter might be my new favorite golf pro. What an absolute great bloke.
Well done Rick 😁👍
It would take me about 2 weeks and my life savings in golf balls to finish a round here
Ian Poulter, one he'll of a guy 👍 I would love to play a round with Ian 👍 My brother was lucky enough to play with him a number of years ago at Leighton Buzzard and said what a great guy he was. I can dream 😁👍
‘The Postman’ delivered some great one liners and a wonderful insight to a top,top pro’s thinking. Superb fight back Rick !!
Great video! Ian Poulter great fun as always. Good match! Brilliant entertainment! 👏🏻
I saw Ian in Adelaide @ LIV  Golf . Lovely guy
What a great guy to play with! So Rick, if you had stuck to your 8-iron on 13, do you miss the tree branch, it hooks and kicks left, back of the green, IP is in trouble off the green and...
Boss bears Boss. Utterly superb watch
Rick: Natural Draw, yeah.  Rick: Hits it perfectly straight first shot, into the woods.  Me: I hate it when they go straight!! haha
Simply the best YouTube content I've seen.  New appreciation for Poulter!
Ricks new 'Dam' in an american accent when a bad shot is hit is pretty funny
Great video . Ian was a nice guy   Jimmy Bullard would smoke Rick . Take him to the cleaners if enjoy seeing that match .
His name should be SIR Ian! What a legend this man is🫡
Rick is a poor example with all the negative sighs and whining after mistakes.
Top fucking quality 👌🏼
Best video for a long time Ian was great and informative as to what shots to hit brilliant
I work 2 days a week at home and 3 days at work. How do I approach my boss about the conversation on sneaking out for an audition?
Best one you’ve done. Class from Poults
Poults.... Legend.
I watched them forgot to like just seen it on fyp and liked what a video unbelievable
Best match you have ever recorded. Hands down!
This was class!
Man I guy I love to hate.... But in truth love to watch him play and do well, just not in the Ryder Cup...lol
How frigging cool to have Ian Poulter giving you golf tips during the round,  gret vid
Love how Ian was being a caddy, awesome Help and advice great round boys
Get Rory!!
My god great video!!! Some unbelievable golf in the back 9 there. Great job!
His dad is pretty cool!  Met him at LIV Orlando
Great vid.. Ian is a cool dude
Who cares about old LIV guys???
The editing on this video is top notch! Ian just comes across as such a genuine guy and as always rick you made things interesting. What a Fantastic way to spend a couple hours of my free time watching this video 👏🏌️‍♂️⛳️
Ian is a stooge.
Have to be honest and say I was very anti Poulter following the LIV business - which I still think is dangerous nonsense - but that was about as good an advert for a pro sportsman as you could get. Genuine nice guy, really different to what I expected. Fascinating to see his thought processes around the shots and well done Rick for taking it to the 18th. All round excellence!
That’s just gone straight to the top of favourite vlogs. Great entertainment. What a finish !! That course looks very narrow and very difficult.
Maybe the longest tightest par 4s I've ever seen
Great..how about a rematch..I laughed outloud many times...
Best guest by quite some distance. Considering his standing in the game,  it's brilliant to see how grounded his is, and genuinely supportive and encouraging towards his opponent. Absolute gentleman.
Became an even bigger fan of Ian because of this video, thx Rick and Poults for some great fun!!!
Poulter is a bro. Big fan now. Westwood, Scott, Fowler....all super cool. Great series Rick. Keep em coming bra! F J B
Best one yet Rick… Poults input, commentary and humour is a treat to watch…2hours of fantastic entertainment 👍👍
Hands down the best guest thus far.  Ian was all class with time, encouragement, explanations.  Unbelievable content I thought.
In 20 years I've never pulled against Poulter and sorry Rick but I wasn't going to start now. Great video and looking forward to a rematch!
So many adverts!  Great video, though - lovely to see IP working hard.
Ian’s a Cool guy
Poulter is definitely my favorite so far. Such a genuine and funny guy
Travesty if Poulter never gets to be captain. Make it happen.
Probably the best Rick Shiels video ever!
Sorry but Ian laughing at 1hr 43 is the funniest thing ever!!! What a great video 🤛🏼
That was brilliant. There isn’t many YouTube videos I can watch that are nearly two hours long in one go
That put a massive smile on my face. Rick was great. Ian was phenomenal - talking through the shots and a cracking laugh
Great video Guys.
I love LIV and Poults as great entertainment - thanks.
You need to make the next one the the 11 stroke challenge 🙈😉🤣
Any statisticians on here tell me the last time Rick stepped up and said "I'm gonna just hit this one straight" 😅
Ian is just a great bloke isn't he!  Great Video.
Your best 10 shot challenge yet, poults was fantastic and incredible to hear his insight - as always when it counts poults comes up with the goods!! Rick, for the next one just hit 3 iron off the tee for the first 5 par holes that are par 4 and or 5’s and you won’t lose!!
“Can I call you Poults”  Behave yourself Rick 😂
Rick you play like an 8 hcp...what is your WHS hcp..or is that something you keep to yourself
Absolutely loved watching this video, always been a fan of Ian’s and this just makes me more of a fan. Like others have said the time, tips and praise that Poulter had for Rick was great to watch. Brilliant to see the laughs and competitiveness in both too. It’ll be tough to produce a better 10 shot challenge episode I reckon.
Your best video ever (And that’s not easy)....and probably one of the best golf video on YouTube, no doubt !! Thx to the postman...he has delivered .... once again !
That course would do my head in, way too many trees
Great stuff Poults!
What about two videos front 9 and back 9 🤷🏻‍♂️😂 then we can just watch the back 9 for you Rick ❤
Never comment on the videos, just enjoy the content and get on with my day, but this honestly is the best video ever posted on the channel.... Poults is an absolute leg end! Unreal finish down the 18th.... Class (unlucky Rick)! 👏👏👏👍
I don't know who was worse you or the blag pro golfer, it's time to give up for both embarrassing
Many thanks to Ian for taking time out of his schedule for this challenge. It was absolutely amazing to watch!
While the content is brilliant...two 20 second adverts every 5 minutes makes this a tough watch
Absolutely Awesome.👍👍
Ian is like a old wise owl, who's human life was as a pro golfer. But he was given one day, by a genie, to be a human again. And he chose to spend that day with Shielsy, possibly even Ricardo Shielsy!
The postman. Legend.
Can someone explain to me the weather in the UK? Rick is dressed like it’s always 50-60 degrees. Then Ian Poulter comes out dressed like it’s florida summer golf 😂😂
Wonderful~!!
Greatest Rick Shiels video I've ever seen, and I've seen many.. Seriously, Ian was amazing, loved all the talk and the analysis.. Just unbelievable golf!
Fantastic video!  Thank you very much Rick this was an amazing watch and I’m glad you get to do this and take us along for the ride.
Best Youtube content i watched so far! Pleas make the match against Henrik Stenson happen. Best regards from a Stensson in Sweden.
This video changed my mind about Ian. Didn't like the guy before, but seemed like a great guy!
Brilliant video. Great banter from Poults who was supportive, insightful and played some terrific shots - the up and down at 7th was amazing. Some greats shots from Rick. I reckon a couple fewer wayward tee-shots from Rick and he'd have won.
What a great guy, superb
Poulter sounds like Rod Stewart
Wonderful video.  Very enjoyable. Thank you!
Fascinating to hear all the things that go through his head b4 he even his a shot. Now i know y i suck at golf.
First hole was a par 5 so scoring is off - Ian got a 4?
It is so fun to watch,  great job ❤
always a pleasure to watch! dont worry Rick, one of these times everything will come together and youll beat one of the Pros
Such a great Episode epic 😊
Ricks games gone, like mine 😂
Anyone know what shoes ricks wearing?
Favourite vid from Rick Shiels so far! Poulter is pure quality
Such a tight fairway is where I hit the hybrid driver.
This is much better than watching tour play. It always amazes me how the pro’s have another gear and can turn it on anytime they feel like.
Great video, Poults fab verbalising his thoughts .. Rick off the first was a blast, been there got that t-shirt 😂
Okay so I just had a realization that makes me a little sad. I like Rick’s channel and have been watching for some time, but I am seeing a ton of bought comments in this section. Like a massive amount. I was like Jesus Rick had more positive support than anyone I’ve ever seen, but then I started noticing the names… first and last followed by 4 numbers over and over and over again all joining YouTube within the past year and only having comments on ricks channel, Don’t believe me just scroll for a sec. It will be like with a generic super positive comment. There are thousands of these. This is not necessary Rick. Just let the real comments roll, good and bad. People still love your channel whether they are here to see you play good or bad. But the amount of bots in here are extremely obvious.
Love the trash talk with his son.
This was amazing! Wow
Great guy, great match, great video ! Maybe not your fault but sorry, just too many adverts !!!
Great to watch seeing and hearing how a top player takes on a course. Mr Poulter comes across as a very nice person.
I've loved watching all the 10 shot challenges and all the tour pros have been amazing. But I have to say this one (and the one with Rickie) was sensational. Ian Poulter you absolute legend!
I’d love to play a round with one of these guys.  You’d learn so much.  Another great video
Yeah what a vid………… one of your all time best vids
Rick you suck at golf
As an American and watching him over the years in the Rider Cup, always thought he was a bit smug.  Wow was I wrong about what kind of a person he is, really really great video and introduction to someone I will always pull for going forward.
I 100% believe that talking everything through thing Ian is doing, is what he would do with his caddy or coach while practicing.
This was just Superb viewing, Thank you guys. Brilliant!
Poulter one of my favourite golfers of all time, what a great bloke always seems so down to earth! Ryder cup legend was so looking forward to this and it didn’t disappoint.
just loveley to watch!!!!
Ian poultry is a legend and when it comes to Ryder cups up there with Seve status 👍
Oh what a man, Ian. Always entertaining!! Love it!
Liked because Ian Is a good dude.
He was speaking to you as a Ryder cup match play partner.....really fascinating stuff....loved it! Xx
Cracking video, great to give Jo blogs an idea of how the professionals think!
Battered and bruised golf balls? The one's I have left are still in pristine condition........
No wonder he plays for Liv 🤣🤣
That was great,love Ian...that course is tight!!!!
Rick, if you are ever in Scottsdale, AZ let me know. Id love to have a game with you. I'm about a 5 handicap and I think I can beat you heads up.
poulter was a legend! Probably the best one yet!
Ian crying with laughter when you hit the tree was gold.
ian's laugh at the 1 hour 43 minute mark is priceless...playing it on a loop...lmao
Holy ad breaks
This video was more playing lessons with Ian Poulter. The whole match he was showing you exactly what he is thinking. Absolute great video.
Ian came over really well. Great vid.
I really enjoyed this. Mr Poulter was a complete gentleman, generous with sharing his thoughts etc. What I took away - he is meticulous with his clubs and ball - always a towel to hand. It's all in the details. Very entertaining, very educational. Chapeau
Was Ian wine buzzed on the first tee?
By far my best golf video ever I will watch this over and over again thank you Rick and Ian what a match
The only true hope to be found in life is through knowing Jesus as our saviour.  We can know the peace of having our sins forgiven and hope for the future by becoming a Christian. St. John 6:37 Jesus said “....whoever comes to me I will never drive away.”
I've just smiled for 2 hrs. Fantastic content. Ian is a gem. I hope he hooks you up with Henrik - that would be special too.
Great fun. Thanks.
Best video love it ! Ian Poulter is the best.
Loved it - Ian and Rick what a partnership… great finish aswell. This video has to smash 1.5million views
Brilliant brilliant brilliant!! What a great video Rick. Poults is my new hero (he was up there anyway). Gave so much of his time and shot processes. What a legend 💪
@rickshiels please please challenge Henrik Stenson!!! That would be the dream video of my life!!!🤩🤩🤩 I had the greatest honor and pleasure playing golf with Henrik Stenson around Barsebäck Golf & Country Club and it was the best golf experience of my life!!!
Rick- youlet Poulter talk you into that hero shot on 13. As shot you might pull off 3 out of 10 times. You should have punched it down the fairway to perfect wedge distance and kept par in play. You forgot you were in a match!!!
What absolutely brilliant video,  great entertainment. Great to hear Ian verbalise his thought process for each shot and gives us an insight into how the pros think there way around the course. Think you need to have a rematch sometime I the future.
Great two hours thanks
1:07:45 classic interaction about the no tee 🤣. Poulter was like hmmm ok
I enjoyed a cigar through this great golf match!
There should be a ❤ button for.this video
This was a ton of fun to watch
Great watch. Listening to a pro talk through the shot and the options was really cool. Poulter's faces were a riot!
That was a brilliant watch rick. I love Ian poulter. I love him more now what a guy.
Class act from Poults 👏🏻
The postman always delivers 🎉
Bloody hard golf course
Well ian my opinion of you my son has totally changed, i realise when your in a tournament you have to be focused, but you are such a lovely fella m8
A bit too many ad unfortunately..great content but annoying to have 2 ads every hole!
Ian is amazing. Started following him on his socials after this!
That was class 👏👏 What a finish!!!
Great match Poults is a real gent
Absolute delight ❤... one of the best play off. Was little disappointed with your t shots though. Ian is true master class.
Ian the type of guy you could play with all the time and always feel welcomed and feel like ur doing good.
Rick… Westwood told you verbatim what the issue is… your process isn’t automatic, especially when you are nervous, “he’s got no preshot routine” etc… Westy knows
Ian P total legend love him so much what a great guy and Rick so so cruel lost on last until next time
Best guest so far. Was like watching two mates play. Gr8 video keep it going.
Always delivers.....
Brilliant content from both of you, Ian is the best pro you’ve had in the channel so far!
Without doubt your best video to date rick , congrats to you both on great entertainment
Grate video Poults was a gentleman  but at the same time so down to earth and helped us mere mortals to understand reading the game in a really insightful way!
Ian Poulter what an absolute legend!
Epic
how down to earth is poulter???? love the vid great match
Best yet ............ What a great guy Ian is and what a fantastic insight into how a major tour pro not only plays but thinks their every shot. Thank you both :-)
Incredible
Great video. Poulter was fun!
Ian has got lovely, lovely legs
Ian was a fantastic guest. Great content
What a great video. Ian P comes across as a lovely guy.
Got to say he has been my favourite tour player on this challenge and the pod. That was phenomenal
Rick plays his best golf when he hits his natural draw god knows why he tries to play a fade
Best one by a mile. Poults has gone way back up in my opinion. What a dude and so insightful. 👏
Best so far👏👏
That last hole was incredible. As an American I’ve always disliked Ian Poulter, but he was quite enjoyable
This is my favorite video so far….Ian is an amazing dude and funny
absolut fantastic. not boring for a second. thx
Great viewing!!! Should’ve had a better a era on the last putt mind! Rick I’ve never known you to play so poor, man some tee shots. Poults in your head. Really great play the last few holes. Cheers
This was properly my favorite one yet. Great to see Ian and his approach to his shots.
what a top bloke Ian is.
Westwood, Fleetwood, Faldo, Fowler etc we’re good watches but this smashed it out of the park. Having watched Ian over the years I now understand what a competitor he is. For 15 holes he was courteous, encouraging and even coach. However, on the green of the 16th he gave the famous verbal roar and fist pump and switched to “winner and hunter. Ian’s description of each shot and thought pattern was exceptional.  Some more of the same with IP on other courses please Rick 🤞🙏🏻
This is definitely the best one to date. What a great sport Ian is. We have to have another one of these before the end of the year 👌🏼🤞🏼
What a great match. Ian seemed to be a great playing partner, just a round with one of your buddies. Class act.
Best so far.
Wow amazing finish to a fantastic round of golf well done.
Absolutely my favourite challenge yet ❤🎉
Great video the Poults we love and miss on the PGA and DP tour… also will be missed in Rome (although will need to play better  😂)
Best so far. Brilliant from Poulter.
What a great video. 🎉 watched it over two nights. Btw I think at the end of each 10 shot challenge video you should ask the Pro to nominate a pro for the next 10 shot challenge. Just like in this video. Make it a thing 😊 Well done Rick
Excellent video love Ian as a golfer and that birdie on that par 5 amazing 👏
That was the most enjoyable one yet I worked the first liv golf event got to meet some fantastic golfers am gutted I didn't get to meet Ian poulter out of all the big names on the roster poulter was the one I wanted to meet most and I didn't get the chance great video great banter 😂
This is the best golf you tube video I have ever seen and I’ve seen a lot. Always loved Poulter but even more now. Fantastic content Rick keep it coming 👍🏼⛳️
I can safely say one of the best YouTube videos I have ever seen. Ian has some of the best banter and you can see why he does so well when pushed. You know a video is good when 2 hours feels like 2 minutes watching. Justin Rose would surely be a great video also round Goodwood or Manor House. 🎉
Great video, proper character.
Brilliant content! Always liked Ian Poulter, after seeing what a genuine down to earth lad he is in this video, I like him even more!! Great video Rick! Looking forward to the next one! 😊👍👍👍
The most entertaining Rick Shiels video I’ve seen by far. Loved Poults already, but even more now. Some incredible shots played. Nearly 2hrs but I could easily watch again!
I’m not sure why you described Ian’s chip from the path as unlucky. He clearly stated that he landed it short of where he wanted to land it. I do often detect a bit of negativity in your approach and I don’t think it helps your game. Missed putts are often low side, which might also indicate a negative approach. I wonder if some mental coaching could be useful and it might make an interesting topic to document and see what influence it might have on your scores? I also wonder if you could do a video on getting some chipping coaching from one of the guys who are renowned for this? It would be interesting to see and also probably improve your chipping and your confidence in this area. I love these matches - really interesting stuff to watch.
Incredible video! Best one yet. Ian was superb too.
Ian's facial expressions LMAO
This looks like a really difficult course! Awesome video and what a lively,person to play with
Lucky enough to meat Poulter a couple of times and he’s always been really generous with his time, an absolute gentleman!!!!
Ian's face when Rick hit the tree on 17....priceless!!
It's a love fest between you two not like the Lee Westwood match at all! 🥰
Best one yet! Poulter was superb with his time and getting an insight into his though process was great. Keep up the great work! ⛳️🏌🏻‍♂️
As an American I’ve always hated Poulter…seemed cocky and just a pain in the arse in the Ryder cup.  But after this video I’m distraught because he came across as an awesome guy. Fantastic video.
What a brilliant player Ian Poulter is , just brilliant
Such a great video. Well worth the time
What a class guy Paulters seems like, definitely will be keeping an eye out for the Majesticks!
Great video 👍👍
Another amazingly fun to watch match! The intensity and fight to the end spirit was awesome to see in both these players. Loved it all the way through. Keep it up Rick! Great fun. 😀
I think you need to accept that your shot shape is a draw and plan for that Rick
What a great episode.  I must say, watching Ian for decades I've never seen this awesomely cool side of his personality before.👏👏👏
So glad the sound got fixed. This is my favorite video you’ve done. The insight and thoughts Ian gave were amazing. I hope you have him in another video at some point.
Really enjoyed this and podcast.
Probably the most entertaining one yet. Poulter was terrific describing the challenge/strategy with each shot presented. Well done men!
With a hcp 15 I would’ve made a 110 on those narrow holes 😚
It is easy to sit at home and criticise but your game was not sharp enough and course management needs to improve. There is the impression you are just hitting every shot full instead of trying to hit easy swings and shape shots. 2irons, 3 irons  even 4 irons are too hard to use and giving yourself a disadvantage.
Big fan and long time supporter but this video was a rough watch. Just not really great content, I know they all can't be winner but this could have been about half the length.
What a nice guy IP is.
Fantastic video and I loved every minute.... but how many ads were there? Seemed to be at least one a hole which made it quite frustrating to watch.
This was an outstanding match. Big love for Poults
My god, I love Ian even more after that. What a guy.
Ian is hilarious! What a great round.
Great video, would love to see Stenson next, as a fellow swede that would be epic.
Ryder Cup legend! Now you know: when it comes to the end and they called it.............Poulter time
This was hands down one of my favorite YouTube golf videos. (Maybe a Carly Booth video was my favorite) but it’s certainly one of the best. Ian, if your reading this sir, I have always been a huge fan of yours, even as an American watching the Ryder Cup I always appreciated your love and fire for the game. Now, we learn behind that competitive spirit that you have an amazing on camera personality. It came out in this video. Rick, well done as usual in producing great content…this one was spectacular. If either of you ever want to play in the Carolina’s please reach out…would love to host you.
The amount of ads on this video is criminal
That was a fantastic watch and what a great guy Poulter is…one of the few tour pros who will sign every autograph along with Ricky Fowler and Tom Watson. Great content Rick, keep it up 👍
the fact I was smiling at my screen watching says it all.Quality content which, for me , epitomises what golf is all about .well done to all the team involved !
Pure gold
Literally what an amazing video Rick, I think Ian may be my favourite guest you've had on, literally was such am enjoyable watch, the insight he gave to all the shots. Just the way he was, such a humble and nice bloke, would love to see him on again one day, throughly enjoyed this!
What a great video ( the legend that is ) Mr Ian ( the postman )Poulter what a proper gentleman and a great ambassador for the game of golf........  🏌‍♂🏌‍♂
You can tell none of these tour pros want to be the first to lose to rick.
I always thought IP was really weird for all his reactions, after this found him very pleasant!
loved this whole video, Ian was great talking through his shots and such a good laugh
Thoroughly enjoyable, shot advice, but Ian's banter world class
Great video and really enjoy this series! Bit of feedback though and not sure there is much you can do about it, but the advert load was horrific for me which spoiled it a bit.
Best one yet that Rick, class 👌
You should do a scramble with 2 tour pros and mr. finch and try to break 60!  Great content today Ian poulter is all class and an absolute legend. Awesome video. It’s a stinker that your always just a hair away from an epic shot.   I bet if you started even and the pro started 10 over you’d beat them every time.
awsome
What a top, top video. Just literally sat here for 2 hours straight watching. What a genuine quality person Ian is. Probably my best video of yours that I’ve seen. 👏
Is it just me or is Rick getting a bit of junk in his trunk?
Got to say, Poulter comes across really well on this video. Seems very gracious, even in competition. Supportive and encouraging, compared to Westwood who was just very piss-takey 😂
This is by far, my favorite ‘10 under par’ episode
Good fun guys enjoyed the video
Poults was my hero before i watched this what an absolute top man, best video you've put out by far Rick and for the first time I was rooting for the Pro so good result
The best 10 shot challenge so far because Ian is so relatable. Pure class! Rematch needed.
The most enjoyable golf video I have ever watched on YouTube! 👌🏻
Long video ahead, not even finished first hole 3 adverts
You are such an inspiration. Thank you ❤
Absolutely entertaining to watch and listen to Ian's thought process. A little fun and ribbing added in makes it great to laugh with. Thank you Rick and Ian.
Awesome video . Will be an Ian poulter fan from now on. What an awesome guy to play golf with .
This is the best one by far. What a bloke Poults is. 🤜🏼🤛🏼
This was a fantastic video - loved it!!!
This is the best YouTube video I’ve ever seen! 🏌️‍♂️⛳️🔥
Great video Rick and Ian. Respect to you both. Very interesting to hear how a professional thinks whilst playing.
What an amazing video. Hands down one of the best videos I’ve seen you make. What a great guy Ian was and to listen to the way his mind works over his shots is brilliant. The amount of detail he has running through his head gives us an insight to what tour pros think about. Well played thou Rick. First tee nerves for us common golfers is tough but playing a full 18 with a tour pro must be hard. Well in mate ✌🏼
excellent video, very very entertaining, please have another round with Ian.
Is it just me rooting for the pros in these videos because I don't want anyone to be the first one to lose this challenge! Never really followed Ian before and probably pre judged him based on apparel and star power but what a guy. Such a solid all round golfer with the same energy as my fellow club golf mates. Really hope he still has the chance to captain Europe one day when all of this PGA LIV nonsense becomes history.
1:19:00 he missed on purpose, we all saw the look into the camera after the putt.
"Damn."  -Richard Sheils, 2023.
Very good guys, Ian was awesome (for a gooner) 😂
This was so great to watch and learn from 🤩 … What an absolute Legend and Gentleman Ian is…. Great one Rick! 🙌🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Absolute belter!
What a great video! Hearing Ian Poulter's thought process was so great. He was one of my favorite storylines in Full Swing. Thanks for the awesome content @rickshiels
Looking forward to this just sat down with a 🍺 to enjoy this. Hope the nerves calm dowm for Rick after that first tee 💪🏻😂
Fantastic entertainment, watched the whole thing.  Ian is all class and great fun as well.
This was undoubtedly the best 10 Shot challenge yet. Ian is just amazing and a so much fun and enjoyable to watch and listen to.  He was so great with Rick and with personable honesty and genuinely wanted Rick to do well.   So much fun. Loved it!!!!
Awesome!
Best one yet imo. That 2nd on 17 was pure gold, sorry Rick but I was laughing.
That was Epic and hats of to Ian for beign a great character 👍
Watched the first hole you was playing shite and Poulters a money grabbing arab lover................ HUGE thumbs down. Screw liv golf.
Superb and what a great guy @IanJamesPoulter is…….pure gent…👏👏
Great vid, Top bloke Poults !
Thouroughly listen to Ian go through his shot preparation. It was definitely a reminder how we should all approach each shot. Would make a difference in scoring I'm sure. Best guest player ever.
Magnificent episode. What a nice man Ian is. Really enjoyed this.
First time I played this course, on the first hole I hit 3 wood in line with where Ian was but up on the left side of the fairway, hit 3 iron to the front part of the lightning-fast green, hammered the putt way past the hole, and then sunk a 14 footer downhill for birdie. That was back in 1994. The day out was for 2 rounds (Dukes & Duchess course) and a huge lunch. The day cost me £67.50. The same deal today is £345.00 😬
That was the best 10 shot challenge and Ian was an absolute star and gentleman 👍
class video. Ian was so good to watch. some great shots and what a last hole. keep them coming
Pout’s your are ledge! Great vlog!
I did the same as Ian at the second. A single tree in the middle of the fairway 😚
Absolutely quality. Got to love Poults, can tell how much he just loves the game.
I think you do yourself a disservice by starting at -10. Psychology you think you have too much of a cushion. I think you would be better off starting off even and play with your handicap.
What an entertaining episode. Ian was so much FUN with both his comments and expressions. I also enjoyed his verbal thought process for shots, so many of us should learn from that, great job!
What a guest!!
What socks is Poulty wearing in this?
I'm a pretty big fan of your channel -- I've watched a sizeable portion of your vid's -- and this ranks as one of your best. I only watch the Tour occasionally (mostly majors) cuz it's hard to relate to the tour pro's: the absurd distances they hit (I mean McIlroy is what ... 5'9"?) and the flawless ball-striking and all-around skill -- it's a different sport than what I play (a male US duffer typically shooting 90ish). In fact, I find the women's tour easier to relate to as the club distances seem more human. Your series featuring tour pro's is terrific as you guys skillfully select authentic and personable players who are excellent at articulating their course management, shot selection, etc ... I've been rooting for Fowler since you played him in FL. Poulter was great (even as his game seemed off), the match was actually fun, and besides the insights Poulter shared, you could also see his intense competitive nature come to the fore. Really good job, guys. Thanks.
"I'm not thinking, because I pulled a 3-wood out" is one of the best golf quotes I have ever heard :)
Poults is the man 😎
Poulter was just pure class
I think I might be better than Rick at this point lol
I really enjoyed that game of golf. Close finish to boot. 😀It was a pity there was so many ads.😒
As a Spurs fan, it's hard, but I still love Poults. Best video so far. He's a cracking fella and very generous with you. Top bloke.
The Comms from Ian & his thought process is just unbelievable Rick.  The best you have had so far in my eyes on not an easy course
Quality! 🎉
Bloody brilliant, was with you both all the way 👏👏👏👏👏
Rick you've thrown your chipping lesson in the trash?
Fantastic - Ian Poulter, what a gent he was absolutely brilliant.
It is so interesting to hear the thoughts around each shot. This is like a playing lesson with two pros...very educational!!
Gold Rick!
Top video!! Ian seems such a nice genuine guy
Ian Poulter what an amazing person Just to listen to how he thinks about each hole was great What we amateurs don’t do Best video todate
Great studio Rick. How about reviewing clubs and dolls suitable for pensioners .
World class. Hearing Ian P talk through his shot selections just awesome. Also, how much does he take care of his clubs and the course?! Brilliant to see. Just a fantastic video.
An absolute classic - many thanks!
What the hell was that tee shot on 6? Cmon, Rick
What a great video with one of the ryder cup greats . Really entertaining  and what a gent ian is . Looking forward to the next
Absolutely one of the best challenges on this channel!!! Great match!!!
A very tough course.. The positive I'd take Rick is you played your 3 best shots of the day on the last hole when you were under the most pressure so fair play for that...
Great watch!
Poulter seems like such a great guy! 👍
Brilliant Rick. Poulter - what a legend. Awesome insight to what he's thinking. Course looked bloody hard!
Superb!
Stenson would be awesome
Kinda crazy. I can't stand Ian in interviews etc. But he seems like a great guy on the course.
What a brilliant video.
What a match! Great job Rick and Ian 🍻
RIck sucking up to Ian during the entire video was disturbing to listen
Great game guys. Thank you Ian for taking the time to explain your shot thoughts, best 10 head start   , of them all👍👍
1:43:00 the look on Ian's face made the entire video!!!
Rick absolutely fantastic, you both looked like you genuinely enjoyed your round and each others company. What a lovely bloke Ian is.
Amazing video and amazing guest. Ive always liked the bravado of Poulter, but hes definitely showed his more humble side through this video and the podcast. A prooer down to earth bloke with top banter.
Is it hold or cold there, can't tell haha
Who is ian poltier?
This comment is an Ian Poulter hair appreciation society comment
That had to be the best challenge you've done so far. Ian is an absolute legend
Simply loved it ⛳️👌
Epic!
Epic!
Best 10 shot challenge sofar
A fantastic video, what a top man Ian Poultwr is, has always been a favourite and will be a huge miss at this year's Ryder Cup!!
After the interview, ian changed my mind about him. After this round I am now a fan. What a class act. And he's great on camera. This is the best round/challenge yet!!!
This has to be the video of the year !!! Ian has been an amazing guest, he so good with his commentary. Loved it !!!
For sure one of the best videos you done Rick! And got to see a lighter side of Poulter which is great! Thank you for the wonderful video!👏👏⛳
The best one yet. I wasn't sure about IP till i saw this . What a genuinely nice and helpful man. Great stuff.
Loved this one! Poulter could join every week!
Ian seems like a guy you'd like to have a few drinks with after a good round of golf. What a battle 👏
Taking driver at 17 was your downfall. He told you 230-250 landing area 🤦. Next time, remember how many shots your infront by and play safe golf, forget the worldies! 😅
Thoroughly enjoyed this one, thank you. Poults is such a legend
What a great video.  Ian’s dialogue talking through his thinking around every shot was absolutely fascinating
Genuinely enjoyed this 👌
Great round!
At 7:37 it was very weird for me to hear a non-american say "inch" I get that we use every measurement under the sun except metric measurement except when it comes to our freedom seeds but man, that sent me through a loop lol.
Just great vId for all to watch keep up the work
Thanks so much guys that was great viewing 👍
Any one tell me why Ian always had a towel in hand when going to the greens
Class Rick best one yet and so unlickynwith yourn2nd shot on the 18th 😢
Loved the way he cracked up when you hit the tree 🤣
When Ian is done competing...he has a very bright future coaching! His ability to talk Rick through his shots is beyond impressive. Doesn't tell him what to do...let's him give his thought process then gives gentle nudges to a different approach.
Excellent, this was the best one yet, this along with Tommy Fleetwood was truly amazing. What a humble man Ian is, a true gentleman and great ambassador for the game. Thanks Rick, this has raised my morale following a terrible few weeks.
Rick I love your content but you are a TERRIBLE putter!
Cant watch Rick play anymore, that fact he gets so many opportunities to play with great players and plays so poorly bothers me. Its a joke to say he's a scratch golfer.
Ian is such a genuine bloke. You two were awesome together.... Great Video guys
Can’t wait to see you against Stensson! Of course it will happen
Anyone else get the feeling Ian was sandbagging some of those early putts to keep it entertaining?
This is bugging me so bad. Ian was -1 after the first and then they immediately forgot about the birdie and counted him at even par.
Lol at Poults shouting "Down Shep!". Only Brits of a certain age would or could quote John Noakes like that! Made me laugh.
Absolutely knew Poulter would make that last putt. He's such a competitor and a character. Really enjoyed that.
Poulter is a top bloke.....best ever on the channel....well played both👏
Great video. Poults is always damn good value and a great watch. Great shit talker but always comes over great on camera and great advice.  You can see though, his game isn't where he wants it to be at the minute, but watching him get round and manage his game is awesome. True pro.
Brilliant, smiling all the way.😁😁😁
Funny thing.  I was watching on my tv and noticed the audio was way off, so I stopped watching yesterday.  Now I'm watching on my computer and it's fine.  I wondered if something was wrong with my tv until I noticed your it's fixed comment.  Phew!
Best video let alone 10 shot challenge I’ve seen from you! Anything with poulter is class, enthusiastic, doesn’t seem forced etc pure entertainment from start to finish from both! Thank you
Brilliant content, Up there with Ricky's 10 shoter. Loved it.
What a great video  Ian poulter was fantastic. Loved the interaction between you both. I dont give a Ruck about LIV anymore 😂 Best guest so far and a doubt you will get a better one.
The Postman delivers … what a quality guy.  Total respect !
Fantastic! My only thought was you should have done the same challenge but match play… you start 6ish ahead or what you think is fair then see if Poults could come back. Amazing video regardless as an American I still love this guy. His shot by shot explanations are incredible
Best one yet, loved it
One of the best yet!. I'd love to see Justin rose on the next one.
Why do I think rod Stewart when I see Ian poulter
Mr Poulter, what a great bloke you are.
Fabulous quality edit. Great banter. Superb entertainment.  It's watching two mates, Rick and Ian, out on a round.  What. A. Video.
Ian: you’ve hit it 7 yards ROFL!
Rick, I noticed on your chipping and pitching you have the longer slower swing you were working on but you still had the low driving follow through that's got you asking for the ball to stop.
I assume he's one of these who turned pro off 3/4.!? They should change it to Scratch or better not 4.4. You've got lads who can't even get in their club scratch team turning pro.!
Soft open face chip 3 wood slice is one of the craziest things ive ever heard😂😂 only a tour pro could think of something like that😂
Poults is a gentleman - what a guy.  Great video too 👌🏼
What an absolute legend Ian is, competitive without being arrogant and helpful, what awesome viewing 😎
Best battle ever. I feel like I should have paid for that much entertainment
One of your best videos, I really enjoy your challenging the pro series and I’ve changed my opinion on Ian Poulter ! Despite him supporting Arsenal!! COYS
Best yet! Top bloke
That was class, Ians wee faces he pulls are hilarious hahahaa
Class video, Poults superb too. More of these pls Rick
Rick, maybe maybe you Peter and Andy could beat him?!
I know you rave about that driver being so forgiving but man, you rarely hit a fairway, you're left, you're right, give something else a chance, can't hurt🤷‍♂️
That was really fun!! I love these matches against tour players!!
Best one yet!
Ian Poulter what a star a really genuine guy.  Thanks, also to Rick.
40:50 no Rick you should not have chipped it... :).      Ian Poulter is a great person, if not this video we wouldnt know!
I like how Ian caddied/helped Rick even though they were competing. Class act.
This was such a good video are you kidding me. Such a good synergy between you and Ian. Love the banter.
Love Rick S. Will not watch Ian P. Who sold out to support killers.
Easily one of the best videos on this channel
Nice video, but couldn’t finish it- WAYYY too many ads
Through all your hard work and grind on YouTube Rick, you’ve got to do what all us golfers dream of, play it for a living. Not only that, getting to play it with who we all love watching growing up. Thank you!
I choose to watch this over the Scottish open.  The best video ever!  Ian = 🐐
As i Scratch Player i would be extremely reluctant to take advice from a guy shooting in the 80s Consistently.  Yes Woburn extremely tough. However this guy gets access to top courses and facilities on a regular basis. Most good Amateur Golfers have to work. Yet, would Consistently beat Mr Shields.!
Great video !!
What a class act, always liked Poults. This is the best along with Adam Scott, of the matches between tour pros
This has got to be the most I’ve ever learned watching one of these. Incredible video. Ian was a perfect guest. I hope he makes a return!
Think a new driver is needed 🤔😅
Best video to date... Ian Poulter is such a great character, really entertaining thank u...
had a lot of fun watchin this
I cant getover how much information he gives up not only about the course but his shot process.  What a guy.
Brilliant vlog absolute legend is that Ian Poulter He just doesn’t like losing .
Been watching Golf YouTube videos for a long long time and that was without doubt the best video I’ve ever seen. Poults is absolute Top Class, such a gent, still a phenomenal golfer ** that 3 Wood was insane** and just the time spent and advice given shows what a great guy he is!!!   No YouTuber does it better… keep up the great work Rick. 👏👏🏆🥇🏌️‍♂️⛳️🏌🏼‍♀️
Epic match!
Love Poulter
Great Video!   Love  Poulter's personality.
Best one yet!! Loved it😎
What a great ambassador and all round great guy Ian is. His experience, class, honesty and humour is what we love. I felt I was a caddy listening throughout the round. Thanks to you both.
Love this Rick!! Absolute Legend of the game. Please do more!
Hands down the best golf match i have seen on youtube . What a legend pults is. An incredible watch . Well worth the wait for the re syncing. This one i hit the like. Well done Rick 👏 ✔️ 👍
Watching this in chunks … but absolutely excellent … Poults is just so funny and one of the lads. Love his humility, sharing his thought process. It’s also inspiring to see good golfers such as yourself and the Medinah genius battling just like the rest of us mere mortals … brilliant vlog … thanks for sharing 😊
Rick hits any bad shot, “dim”
I never thought he was a nice guy from what it seems in tv, but he’s actually a very nice person, super cool guy
The best video in this series, Poulter is an absolute legend, loved all the advice he gave to Rick but especially loved Ian's asides to camera when Rick was playing some of his shots, very funny. the golf was very poor but what entertainment.
Unreal best one yet 👏🏼
From the sassy look on the first hole, I know this is gonna be funny as hell... omg... this just feels like "the office" every time it pans to Ian  Poulter
So good. Best one yet
2 trees were harmed in the making of this video…
Best golf channel on YT hands down.
Wtf has happened to Ricks game
Ian is a  great guy to play golf with. That looked like great fun.
That was a belter of a match. You came alive on the back 9 Riack, but Ian is such a class player, and I love his thought process and assistance he gave. Such a great insight into a top pro golfer. More of these please.
Ian you have always been one of my fave golfers.
Easily the best 10 shot challenge yet....
I totally enjoyed this
Are adverts every 3-4 minutes now the standard?!
Between Full Swing and this I can't help but like Ian.
Rick… this was the best one yet.. the mentality of Poulter is absolutely unreal.. WHAT. A. FINISH 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Best yet. Rematch required!
Poults is a legend
1:49:00 That right there had earned Ian’s respect on the course
Awesome video
OMG Ian talks - if I would play with him I would asked that he could keep his talking in his head, instead of knowing what he calculates of shot - and then very rare even hit the number
Incredible video. Seeing how Ian’s brain works over every shot is amazing!
What a fantastic game. Ian is such a nice guy even helping with thought process...
Ian. What a genuine gentleman.
Ian is a fave! Great video!
Really loving the 10 shot challenge series, keep it up!! Love how Ian talks thru his shots in detail, really nice to be able to see how a tour pro thinks thru each shot.
Love how it shows that even GREAT golfers have bad shots.  And Rick you don't hide from things.  You are a real golfer.
Wow that course looked tight. To hit off teas to holes that tight gets on your head so bad.
Best video on the Rick Shiels channel ever! Love Ian, favourite golfer on the planet and it was amazing to hear him talk around the round.
One of your best Videos Rick, that was so entertaining and gave so much info on approaching shots…
Question..... Would a Scratch Golfer be happy shooting +11.!???
This track looks incredibly difficult and tight. Jeez
Shocking that there was only a 10-stroke difference watching this match. Ian's makeable putts weren't dropping and Rick was scrambling for his life.
no way anyone watched this in full.....
Ian’s class
What a brilliant piece of entertainment.  Made so great by Ian's generosity with his time, knowledge, commitment and determination.  The way he treated Rick as an equal and acknowledged the great shots while still wanting to win shows what a true gentleman he is. Just brilliant
Rick on the 1st my shot shape is a draw . I thought before he even hit this is going right guaranteed … an right it went lol .Almost every shot Rick you talk yourself down an put negativity in your game as if the world is against you . Other than that great video, an the postman once again did deliver.
Rick “let me hit a provisional “ shiels
Ian has just confirmed for me, that he’s the type of bloke you’d not only like to play 18 with, but also hit the 19th afterwards and it would be just as entertaining! Great video and a great insight into how the pros think! Thoroughly enjoyed this video!!
By far the best video yet. Just pipping Iona at Crail. Please get Monty on 🙏🏼
100% the best video you’ve done Rick, Poults is a legend and between you both this video I will be watching over and over again!! BRAVO gents 🙌🏻
Great video.  About twice the normal length but understand why.  Probably was hard to get under the 2 hour mark with all the great commentary by Ian.  I think the next time you do this type of video, try playing as a 10 handicap and do match play.  Might be a fun twist.
This is the best yet!!! Amazing!!!
Again Rick showing how bad he is . He does this for a living. !!!! Ex pga pro my ass
Awesome video! That came really came down to the wire!  Poulter’s a class act 💪💪💪
This was everything I thought it would be and more!
This isn't just me, right?  Ian for the win as best guest?!?!?  All the asides and commentary breaking the fourth wall.  Classic!
Ian Poulter. What an absolute great guy!
Please ….please please let me sort your putting out for you?? Contact Mel
Rick, as s PGA professional, why aren't you cleaning your ball or clubs after you hit? Look at Ian after every shot and always carry a towel to clean his ball. Isn't keeping the face of your clubs clean important?
Such a great match. I love a good golf vlog, but this match was on another level. Thanx to Ian for the knowledge and entertainment. Thanx to Rick for capturing an epic round of golf.
Absolutely brilliant, without doubt the best 10 shot challenge yet, mind you if Ian's putter wasnt so cold he would have been out of sight after 12 holes
When Ian needs to,he delivers,great viewing Rick.
That was awesome. Ian seems like such a great guy.
Absolutely class. What a video, what a match, what a guy!
What a gentleman! Great game, great commentary and what a lesson in course management.
So interesting what different things amateurs and pros are struggling with.  Amateurs: trying to keep their drives on the planet.  Pros: worried about spinning it 30 feet back off the green.  Got to love this about golf.
Great video! Ian loves that towel!
The highest quality golf content on YouTube.  Thank you for all you do for the game and for our entertainment.
Sucks getting older, doesn’t it? You might need to take about 5-8 mph off your driver swing.
That was a fun video. You could tell he got serious the last three holes
Rick it’s like you completely forgot everything from the chipping lesson 🙈. Fan the face open and slow down the swing
The Rod Steward of golf, love him❤his book was awesome
Excellent video Rick. Loved Poulter too. Thanks to you both.
I sincerely hope more people can see what a great guy Ian is after this. I've always liked him, even more now.
Getting rid of my TV licence, its pointless, Rick Shiels Youtube channel is unbeatable entertainment! Brilliant video! Poulter is an absolute gent too. Cheers Rick.
Great video Shielsy. Gotta get the dod king on next, would be epic
I think I enjoyed that match more than any other.   Genuinely looked like a really fun round
This is hands down, the best 10 shot challenge video so far... Maybe the best video on the channel of all.
This video is excellent viewing. Superb stuff 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Camera quality and drone shots are awesome on this !!
INCREDIBLE! So unlucky on the 18th! Lovely round of golf
Without question, the best 10 shot challenge video to date.  Possibly one of the most entertaining videos on your channel.  Well worth the time spent watching it on my Saturday morning.  Well done, Rick and team!!  Bravo!
Thanks to both for a fantastic watch. Both of you were bloody great
Absolutely brilliant watch ,I take my hat off to you both ,Ian has showed a side to him that we rarely see and I praise him for his advice ,humour and down to earth nature ,this is my favourite golf video ever, thanks so much to both of you .
Thanks to Ian Poulter, this was a great master class, letting us know his thinking process on the course.  @ Rick, after the 2nd hole you and Ian made a click and it turned into a great content, it seems a fun person to play with. 🎉🎉
I love the little replays with some quotes here and there. Brings alot to the feel of the edit!
This course is mint
Two hours of gold ⛳
Cracking video. Great insight from Ian Poulter.
This has been my favourite 10 under challenge! Ian was a class act and the running commentary from his perspective was great to hear! Awesome stuff 🤘
Wow wow wow
Great video Rick; I was hoping for a win for you in this video but then Ian had to go and hit one stiff on 18...oh well, at least you lost to a good guy hitting a great shot!  I love your head-to-head play videos, and I know you've made at least one video with mulligans, but I have a suggestion please:  I'd like to see how low you could go on a course you know well by playing a one-man scramble format.  That is, not using mulligans but rather, hit two tee shots, select the best location then hit two approach shots from there, hit two putts from the best ball location on the green, etc.--do it exactly as though you were two people playing in a scramble all the way into the hole.  Perhaps you could pull off a 62 or 63 or lower?  I'd love to see it.  Great channel, I've told several friends about it too.  Fred, Sarasota, FL
Love the long videos 👌
One of us! One of us! Loved the start of the video, it was a tough scene for Rick but shows you that even the great ones mess up sometimes
Definitely need more of Ian on the channel - informative, great little tips and entertaining when he's interacting with us as the viewer 👍🏻💪🏼👍🏻
i have always been on the fence with Mr Poulter. but this has massively changed my opinion of him What a guy. top top guy, not a huge liv fan, but majesticks will be the ones i'll lean towards. Great Video as always, love these
Can’t say I’m a big fan of Ian Poulter but I may have done him a disservice, he was an excellent playing partner and seems a nice bloke. Very enjoyable, thanks.
That was so bloody good. Looking forward to the next one 👏
What a video. Absolutely awesome. Ian was a fab guest and a top bloke. Really turned on the style for the last few holes.
The best 10 under Ian what a star
My favourite video so far. Poults was great to watch and loved hearing his thought process 👍
Rick's shape is slowly morphing into rubber ducky look. His posture is awwful.
Can Rick explain why he seldomly slips in a "damn" like he's from New Jersey
Ian is a complete gentleman. He took so much time to talk to me before he did his shoey in Adelaide after he signed my hat I have so much respect for the man
Poulter was intentionally but in a helpful way to the viewer & Rick, staying in 3rd gear 👍🏼  When he wants to be at it, he can dial in. Lovely bloke and big family man. Thanks lads - enjoyed that 🙏🏼
So unlucky on that last putt mate. Loved the video. What may improve your luck is giving someone with a scrap yard driver the chance to improve their game by sending them a decent driver. 😉🤣
I am a fan of Poulter, after this I am a bigger fan. Such a good man. All the best Ian!
Thoroughly enjoyed that video Rick & Poults! Woburn looks hard af. Its just up the road from me as well, but I need to get a bit straighter with tee shots before braving it.
Great video as always Rick. Now for Stenson round Nona!
Inches from the craziest moment in golf history
Best one yet!!!
By far the best 10 shot challenge! That 2nd shot on 17 hitting the tree had me in tears 😭 with laughter! Phenomenal camera work with what looked like 3 cameras plus drone coverage. Poulter was awesome. Love to see his thought process behind his shots and yours. Banter was fun to watch. Woburn GC is phenomenal. Love the drone coverage of each hole.
A great watch, best one yet. Ian’s comments and humour on the way around made it awesome. Top fella Mr Poulter
Poulter was fantastic.
Ian has been the best caddie yet of the pro players. Maybe he knows that course really well …. He thinks of a lot ore stuff than most amateurs playing that is for sure ! Great to get to know Iann better , thanks rick and Iann
That was pure fun to watch! You came soooo close !!
BEST VIDEO EVER Shiels Saheb!
One of the best. Ian Poulter was a brilliant guest.
Loved this one over the other 10 shot challenges. Not scintillating golf however, the thought process these guys go through and then to execute those thoughts into some fabulous results is marvelous to be part of.
Team Rick, thank you for making these giants human.  The transparency lifts the veil of media hype or villiany, and makes them human.  They're multidimensional and more interesting than what we'd otherwise see on a broadcast.  Keep it up.
these are so cool of videos. what an experience to play with a tour pro. almost two hours long but watch every minute. good video RS
Amazing video! Almost perfect....Only way this would of been better is with a half way house sausage roll review by Ian 😂
Awesome Video! Nice seeing worse shots! 👍😎 And great shots!
Tough luck Rick. I know you had a few rough holes but you played some great stuff too. IP is a top bloke. Great video
Wasnt poulter 1under after 3 tho?
Poulter was awesome in this video. Props to him. Great content.
Best golf cast over 18 holes ever . The info and knowledge shared by Ian was excellent. Great video
It was fantastic to watch these two fine sportsmen having great fun. After watching this I watched the Scottish Open.....Rick, please don't have that total knob Tyrell Hatton on this channel. For every bad shot he blamed his club, the crowd, dropped F bombs etc. Get him out of golf.
Love the video! Only wish poults was more less family friendly and cursed more 🤣
One of the best videos yet, awesome hearing Ian talking through his thought process and an entertaining match. What a finish.
The best golf video I’ve ever seen. Loved it!!!!!!!!!!⛳️♥️⛳️♥️⛳️♥️⛳️♥️
More like Thick Shiels in those pants 😍
Good episode this!! Try for Bob McIntyre at Loch Lomond.. would be a good battle that
Brilliant video Rick....👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻
superb guys😁
Anytime I have a putt that winds up like 34:46, I imagine Xian telling me "Kick the tree!" replaced with "Putt the ball!"
Great match! That looked like a very tough course with the tight tree lines. Even fairway shots getting punished by over hanging trees. Ian made the video very entertaining. Glad he clutched up the last few holes!
Rick really gets into his own head way too much.
Top shelf entertainment!  Poulter was fabulous as always, what a pro and great person!  Best yet Rick!!
Great video, a lot of fun to watch 👏🏻😊
For Golf fans this video format is 24 carrot 🥕. Thoroughly entertaining! Thanks for doing a sterling job Rick. 🏌🏼‍♂️⛳️👏🏻👏🏻👍
By far the best video I’ve seen on your channel. Ian Poulter what a gent!
Fantastic game
next has to be padraig harrington.
Thats the best -10 start you've done in my opinion. Well done and what a guest to have. He was so open and ask him to do a break 65 with you. That would be a great watch. Sorry Guy 😂
My favourite video so far Rick! Not the greatest golf from either of yous but I've a new found respect for Ian Poulter! Just comes across as a genuinely, nice  down to earth guy. Outstanding 👏
Please buy better mics 🎤. The distortion for Ian was bad.  The video and edit. Awesome
I knew I was better than Rick, I shot 2 over par round there and I'm scratch, so Rick is probs an 8 hcap
Ian and his towel is like Linus and his blanket. Nice vid.
Ian is a top man , very generous guy really likeable, even though he is an Arsenal fan , take my hat of to him.
Great video, camerawork and editing was amazing.
I think that’s the best video yet on this series, close with Adam scott
This content is golden man🏌️🔥 Ian is such a inspiration and it is so cool to see how much fun you guys had
What a showdown!
Brilliant video, the way his golf mind works is awesome to see, what a great insight.
Definitely the best 10shot challenge and what a great man Ian poulter is,top top vid👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Best 10 shot challenge to date  Ian, you are an absolute Gem.  Always loved you as a player but now, I admire you even more. Knew you were going to bring some laughs and that you did.  Plus hearing the though process through every shot is just priceless.  Keep up the great work Rick.  Thanks boys  Favourite episode so far
get shane lowrey on
Best video you’ve done in a long time Rick! Ian Poulter providing such entertainment and an absolute natural on camera - puts a lot of full time YouTubers and content creators to shame. Looking forward to the next one (please make it Hatton)
That s@&£ or bust comment from Ian was ace. 😂
What an amazing video some of the recovery play was like Seve, I absolutely love Poulter his Ryder cup performances are legendary. Well done Rick really good effort again, but it's amazing how these tour pro's just have the steely edge and will to win. Loved that.
Thanks for this one on one with Ian, real gentleman and family guy. Brilliant insights, big loss to Europe not tapping him for Ryder.
Brilliant. What a champ for putting himself out there well done Poults
I love how Ian’s little looks over to the camera are like Jim on the Office US😂
Epic. One of the best if not the best.
That was great fun to watch
Best one yet. Thought IJP was always a bit of a wanker but I’m firmly in his corner now. @guy any chance of a quick WITB before the round?
Mental that content like this is free. Unbelievable. Well done all involved
This is by far the best 10under series. Ian was hilarious!!!
More of this ! Really good entertainment! 👏🏻
Epic - great insight into the will and mental energy of a Pro !
Superb content. Best video on your channel
I wish he would stop taking credit for draw shots when he says he’s going to hit a fade 😭😂
Class video, Rick! Ian’s professional swagger and charisma was great
Wow how cool is Poulter, UNBELIEVABLE content
Ian whispering to the camera….. whispering to ME… had me. I love the trash talk while also genuinely rooting you on and giving good advice. Best video
Rick slowly but surely forgetting all that chipping and pitching technique...
I'm a huge Rick fan, but when I watch these 10 shot challenges I do want the tour pro to win.  Great video thanks Ian & Rick! #SorryNotSorry
Great! So entertaining…
Best Golf video I've watched in years, great listening to Paults and a great match, excellent.
Ian is a legend but Rick saying Damn or right over and over I love it😂
Best guest for sure. There definitely needs to be a rematch!
Class from Poulter. Best video on the Channel for me. The way he try’s to help with every shot and breaking it down.
What an absolute class act Ian was.
Why not just call these, “can I stay within 10 shots of pro over a round”? It’s like saying, “can I beat Rory if he gives me 40 strokes?”
Love watching your vids brilliant. Thank u for the entertainment love u 🥰
Rate Ian so much but why did u leave pga 😢
Brilliant video !
Ive been long time follower and agree with many that this might be the best and most entertaining video you've ever posted. New found respect for Ian as well! It was so great to hear his thought process and his approach. He was also very helpful! Well done Rick!!
That’s what I call “Entertainment”!! Ian played to your level for 15 holes to keep it close. Then , over the final three holes, he went into Ryder Cup mode. Simply great chemistry between you two! Rematch in Jupiter, Florida so that I can be in the Gallery!
The start had me pissing myself - nice one poults also 1:12:15 even better
One of my favorite videos so far. Two class guys having a great time.
That was so entertaining....thank you... Woburn looks hard.  😂
Wow! That could be the best one yet!! That was soooo good. Poulter is an absolute gent. Your best pro tour guest so far Rick. What a course as well. Might have to watch that again.
THE best pro you have played with overall so far!!! Loved it 😊💙
Wow, how fun was that? Rick, your attitude is so much better! Ian was fantastic without a doubt the most engaging of all the pros and the consumate pro.
Get Taco golf on the channel asap
Ian Poulter gained me as a fan during full swing and to see him in this environment is so awesome!
Sound lad,another great vlog rick👍
Wow! What a finish! Ian is a true gentleman but you can see the fire in his eyes as well. Awesome awesome match!
What an epic. Poults is awesome, a natural on camera
Thank you Ian!! Great video Rick
Great video Rick.... the Dukes Course is one of my favourites and have been in all those spots (& worse!)- comforting to see scratch golfers also struggle sometimes. Big fan of Ian (but not LIV), which is a shame as don't get to see him play so much. Also sad he won't be in Rome in September... nonetheless, great to see him play against you, looked like you both really enjoyed it. 👍
Class act and a class video. Congrats.
🔥🔥🔥🔥
By far one of the best Shiels video i've ever seen, right down to the last shot. And what a great guest Ian was, the laughs, the banter, the camera presence, the competitive drive spilling through, but still genuine advice for Rick, and excitement over all the good shots. Is it too soon for a rematch?
Great vid,  Ian talking thru his thot process and suggesting best tactics was really interesting
This has got to be the best of these videos so far. Such a great watch. Poults seems such a nice guy. Little bit of banter, but was more spurring Rick on than trying to get in his head (like some other guests) and wanted to see you play good shots. Loved it, can’t wait to watch it again, and to see the upcoming Stenson video 😉😂 keep em coming Rick 👍🏻
You see Rick constantly try to draw or fade shots and be creative, but they often go wrong - whether it's driving or iron approach. I feel like he should just try and hit one as straight as possible and not be so creative. A lot of skill is required to shape shots correctly and I feel like he should just keep it simple!
Ian Poulter so incredibly good in front of the camera. But also how’d good as a golfer the details looking at tree tops, makes us amateurs looks like we’ll amateurs.   Need more content with Ian and other tour pros
This is my favorite video you’ve done yet!! Ian is just a great all around guy.
Best one yet 👏👏👏 Poults is a great guest, he just gets it ⛳⛳⛳
Best 10 shot challenge yet, Ian Poulter class act in every way. Rick if only you can sort out your first 3 holes you would be in with a real chance, but great content well done.
I’m dying at that shot on 17th 😂😂😂
What a great video. Best guest yet. An absolute eye opener to how the tour pro plays a round of golf.  The video had everything keep up the great work Rick..
Does Rick know he is playing stroke play and not match play?
Fantastic video, but,,, the last 4 holes there seems to be more adverts than content !  Getting way to many adds
I just watched the rest today as i enjoyed it far more when it was in sync thanks for the awesome video Rick.
Absolutely loved this! Ian's insight throughout his process was a joy.
Sensational video! Ian was such a nice guy, so genuine, and it was such a great watch
Rick, after that shaky start how you pulled it together and stayed in the game was amazing. Playing against of likes of Ian Poulter with the camera's rolling and hitting the shots you pulled off and... taking it down the wire - good for you.
What a video, course and match.  Oh and I almost forgot Poulter - what a guy. Head and shoulders above the rest. I always thought he was unfairly treated over the years (and not just because of LIV) and these videos prove me right. What a great advert for golf he is...
Phenomenal video, Ian seems like such a genuinely nice bloke. Best video I've watched from you Rick 🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♂️
Stenson next would be awsome, maybe to play on "his" course "Öster by Stenson"
Poults is a ledge
too many ads 😔 great to see Ian on the channel tho, what a ledg 👍
Poults is a natural you tuber. He engaged with the audience so well. His openness and relaxed attitude were fantastic to watch
I shouldn't have watched this, the Ryder Cups over the years have made me hate this man with a blind rage.  This video is making me like him......i don't like it.....
Excellent viewing.Ian Poulter is top notch.great vid Rick.
"little baby cut"; hooks it 20 yards. That's the Rick we know :)🎉
God Tier golf content 👏👏👏
Awesome 👏
Great video. Great entertainment. Great lads
Poulter’s audio is peaking, you can hear the distortion every time his voice gets a little louder. You seem to be having a few audio level issues on this video and one I watched the other day. I’m a film maker, get your camera crew to watch their levels, aim for max levels at -12DB for a bit of safety.
Yeah this was a brilliant video to be fair.  All of the pro challenges have been great but this was the best, Ian just acted like a mate who’s good at golf.  Humble & helpful
No thanks
Great video absolutely class from Poults 👍
Just a tip the reason your shots aren’t going straight all the time because your grip is inconsistent you thumbs should be straight ❤
Just absolutely brilliant, what a great video. Well done Rick.
The best ever 10 under par video. Like two old friends playing a round of golf together. POULTS is an absolute LEGEND.  Any chance of your to doing a break scramble challenge in the future ...????
Class that Rick 🏌️‍♂️👌👍💪
Amazing challenge. Unlucky at the end
I honestly feel like i've learned a lot about golf from watching this video. Ian's the best guest you'be had so far I think. Man's Brilliant!
Fantastic video!! Best beat the pro yet! Great to see how the nerves affect Rick like the rest of us! 😂
What a fantastic video almost 2 hours of pure entertainment Ian Poulter such a nice guy talking us through every shot amazing. Thank you for bringing it to us Rick look forward to the next one 👍👍
Thats was a super awesome video.  Ian is just great. The podcast with him is also awesome.
Great bloke ian
Wonderful content. Liked to the mental thought process Poulter shared with us..
What a top bloke ian poulter is, great watch, best rick vs pro vid yet
Best of the series so far.
Interesting seeing how much Ian used the towel after every shot and to sweep the line of his putt - I guess most Club golfers don’t bother but should!
That was brilliant 👏🏻
I have to say that is the BEST video you have put out so far, fantastic drama and banter between you both. I have always been a fan of Ian Poulter and he didn’t disappoint. Keep up the great content 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Try play with paul Casey
The face Ian made when rick hit the tree was priceless
My favourite pro with my favourite you tube golfer. it doesn't get any better than this. 2 hours not long enough. loved every second of it. thankyou.
The 10 shot challenge just keeps getting better. Ian Poulter is now on my "must watch" RS List!!! What an entertaining vid. Thanks
That's the best video you've done
I ran into Ian Poulter in Singapore last Sept. He is an absolute class. He showed the same humility and professionalism here as well.
Great video.  On 17th green Ian was off the green yet used his towel to sweep clean the green, can he do that? Don't think so! if on the green yes but not if you're off the green.  Rory got done for this once on European tour middle East I think.
What a fantastic vlog Ian is a pure gentleman great entertainment loved every minute keep up the great work.
Haha..."a little fade to the pin"  Hits a draw and suddenly says he plays good 😂😂😂
What a great guy Ian is. I couldn't work out if he was toying with you to make it an exciting game. After 14 holes he suddenly went into The Miracle Of Medinah mode.
Awesome video, what a gentleman he seems. Thank you for the entertainment.
Already loved Ian poulter , but what a too top man he is as well as a top professional ... Great video rick.
The audio timing didn't spoil it for me. Rick Shiels Golf played some great golf. IP was clearly still full of beer and sausage rolls from his holiday. Made for brilliant content.  His narration and course management explanation was a real eye opener. Loved his pi$$ taking to camera too. He was clearly there because he wanted to be, which shone  throughout the vid. Well done Rick. Well done Ian. Great to watch. 🙂🙂🙂🙃🙃🙃
Best video yet❤
Best video you have ever done by far!!
What a match! Ian was amazing!
The best video you ve done by far. Ian Poulter was so open,what a guy,true legend.
Great video, but Rick, please stop saying damn in an American accent! 😂
So. Good. Thanks to you both.
Amazing video. Appreciated every seconds of it. Ian Poulter is such a nice guy.
fabulous content and a lesson to us all seeing Ian use a towel all the time to keep things clean
Fantastic! 14th hole is crazy. Ian is a legend.
Watched all 1hr and 55mins of this video and didn’t get bored ONCE. Absolutely great video and Ian was an amazing guest!
What a channel
Fantastic viewing and very instructive. Thanks both of you.
Definitely the best video by far 👌👌
2hr vid, i though F*** me, but I'm on my second watch of this, Poults is great in this, well done 👏👏👏
Quite simply - a brilliant video. It had everything. Woburn is stunning and what a great playing partner Ian Poulter is. Congratulations - it’s a great watch 👍😀
Brilliant video, thank you both.  Hope to see more of you two. The duo we didn't know we needed.
Fantastic video, fascinating hearing Ian talk through his process! Would love to see him doing some coaching videos 🤘
What an amazing genuine person. A tribute to you Rick that such a special person will come on your channel. An amazing talent that he is what amazes me is his generous nature. A real pleasure to watch.
As you say, Rick, just hearing Ian's thinking is the best bit of this great round!  So interesting to hear his rationale behind shot choice.
best one yet Rick! Paults is the legend that we all no and love already, but this vid highlights what a great guy he is! And a what a course! makes me want to try and play it one day 🙂
Epic video Rick. So interesting how here tour pros up their level in the final holes…
That was bloody awesome. A lovely guy and true gent. Almost Rick, almost😂
rick why te hell would you hit driver on 17? still a big fan, don't worry
2 hour video? That is a fortnight of coffee breaks 😀
Hole 14 members bounce second shot into middle of fairway 😂😂😂
that course looks terrifying
Great video. Ian is such a
I have to admit. I’ve never liked Ian. Probably because he was flashy and kicked the crap out of us during Ryder Cups but the Netflix show, your podcast and now this match has 100% changed my view of him. Great content. Just seems like fierce competitor on top of being a good family man. Good stuff
And after all that the right result , Ian had to dig deep to beat you Rick ! So much fun to watch guys , thank you .
Really good, really interesting to see and hear top players and their thinking. Amazing how these guys talk about spinning the balls yet in my case backspin is very unusual…
Knew it was going to be a great vid when Rick had to hit 3 balls off the first tee 👌
Rick I hope you took all the learning Ian gave you. I'm sure you appreciated it. How priceless he was in his observations. As an interested viewer I suggest your mental approach is where the work needs to happen. Good luck feller!
The best I’ve watched. Loved it
That Poulter shot by the graveyard is one of the best I've ever seen on any golfing channels.
Ian is such a numbers dude, love him talking through his shot process
What a genuine bloke Ian is. Always liked him but this really confirms just how classy he is
sooooo good
That was bloody awesome. Great to remind us all since the poison of the LiV debacle that Ian Poulter is a great guy.  Best yet.
Rick you’re not a terrible golfer so stop beating yourself up on the course… I’m sure a more positive mindset would save you 3 or 4 shots 😂
+11 for 17 holes and he beats his chest copying Poulter and then the cocky twirl after the tee shot on 18. What a Muppet
This was brilliant, simple as.
The best Rick Shiels video of all time. Poults so entertaining .
How f***ing good was that video, absolute quality guest, I’d of watched that even if it was a 10 hour video
Rick simply awesome video and a blockbuster. Beautifully filmed and big thumbs up for the crew.
Rick you need to lay of the sausage rolls  😅
How much £ did he want for this aha
Fantatsic!
The amount of ads is ridiculous.
So good, great watch guys 🍿
Did Rick accidentally nudge his  ball marker forward with his foot, when he was checking out the putt for Eagle on 5?
The BEST 10 shot challenge yet!Ian was honestly one of the best professional guests that you have had.  How do you one-up this one?  Cant wait to see!
Class, class, class. Best video to date Rick.
Rick, go finish reading the Dan Grieve book! Nevertheless great entertainment as always 😂👏
Just play a 16 hole match starting at -6.  We all know how first 2 holes will go.
More videos with Ian please. This was fantastic. I’m now a Majestics fan after seeing him at centurion last week.
I used to think I was an pessimist. But my 2 favourite things to do is fishing and Golf. The pass times of the optimist. Haven’t had a bite all, just one more cast  I will get one for sure …. Play 3 bad shots to get reasonably close to the green, I can chip this in for par.
Such a fun watch Rick! Ian is an absolute gent of a man
Epic video. Ian Poulter what a legend!
When i saw this was a 2hr video I'm starting to think they're getting too long, how wrong i was, enjoyed every minute and didn't want it to end. Ian comes across as a genuinely nice bloke and was class from start to finish. One of, if not your best video to date.. get Guy in on one of the challenges and give him an extra fee shots. Keep up the great work fellas, love the channel
top bloke is ian… great content rick, continues to blow away the youtube competition.
I really want to watch this but with how poorly you're playing Rick, I just can't. Ian is obviously going to destroy you because you will make a TON of stupid mental mistakes that will completely ruin your score. We will watch you try to trudge through the round with a smile but we can see the sadness and despair underneath it all in your eyes....  Edit: So I watched the first hole....Jesus fu cking christ. That was HARD to watch.
Been following you for a very long time and i gotta say this is the best video and edit i have seen from any youtube golfer! Brilliant! Also Poulter was brilliant and knows how to entertain thats for sure.
Loved the one with Fleetwood, but this was the best in its own way. To give you an idea of just how good these tour players are, Rick is a Scratch PGA professional, and Ian has given him tips and lessons through golf shots as well as course management and still won the match. The level is ridiculous. These break 75 , scramble and challenges are the best videos on YouTube. Undefeated. Great job guys 😍🥳
The bad news is I think the 10 under par videos have just peaked. Best one we've seen by far
What a great video! I've always enjoyed watching and listening to Poults, but to get the self commentary of how he plans every shot, and then also gives Rick insight into what he would do in his position! Brilliant!
We Need Ian Poulter As The Ryder Cup Captain A True Legend Of The Game
Wow just wow, loving seeing tour players talk about their shoots, so much knowledge it’s incredible, would love to play with one some day 😊
could watch you 2 play golf all day
Poults ! Phenomenal man ! Just love his style and letting us see an insight into his game play and such a great host to Rick , Woburn possibly the hardest track if your game ain’t quite there ! Loved the video , I’d definitely watch more on different courses between the two of you. Thanks for a great watch while on a sun bed in Santorini .
could watch you 2 play golf all day long
I loved the video. Ian should consider starting a channel as he seems to get it. Very nice guy. I wish Rick would really spend time on his short game. The amount of duffed chips at this point is embarrassing - we want to see you back! That being said you played some great stuff on the back 9. Pleasure to watch!
The best video you’ve ever done 👏👏
Best 1 yet. Thanks rick. Poults is class.
The best video ever . The almost 2 hour video was brilliant. Ian was so helpful with his insight into shots and it was so  close. Rick will you ever start well 😂 Thanks guys 🏌🏾‍♂️
Poulter top bloke
Now this is class! Poulter is a top top guy. Unreal
The running commentary from poults for each shot is fantastic.
… I enjoy Rick’s videos a lot but this is the best ever …
thank you rick and ian for some wonderful content!! (ian is amazing)
The best video you have ever out out. What a guy Ian is. Good to see some wayward shots in there as well
Awesome video. Stenson , Poulter , McDowell, Shiels .. lake Nona 😉🏌️‍♂️⛳️🍻
Loved listening to Ian's thought process. I learned a lot. Seemed like a great guy. Watched him at LIV London and he played awesome 👍⛳
Ian switched it on big time at the end
Brilliant content 👏🏻
What an absolute gent of a bloke ! The insight into Ian’s game is outstanding
What I love most about this is I've seen Poulter play loads, and heard him in interviews, but that is him being a pro. Here we feel like we're just hanging out making friends with him along with Rick. Plus the camera loves him and vice versa. What an absolute treat. Gold.
Bloody brilliant, Ian ticked all the boxes and definitely will follow him. Rick , you did exceptionally well. 🏌️‍♂️great video 🏌️‍♂️
What a great guy Poults is! Would be so much fun to play a round with! One of the best videos yet! ⛳️🏌🏼‍♂️
Too many add breaks very disappointing
Brilliant. Best one yet guys!!!
Best 1 yet...  entertainment gold
IP using  slope mode on his laser - tut tut
Been waiting for this video to drop since the podcast and my word it didn’t disappoint! The level of description and detail of every shot was just awesome to hear. Absolutely amazing stuff. My only question now is, how do you top that? I’m not sure you can but I look forward to watching you try.
Absolutely one of the best youve done so far Rick. Ian was an absolute class act and brilliant guest. Course looked incredible. Brilliant, brilliant content.
1:43:00 - IP's reaction is fucking priceless.  I've become an Ian Poulter fan from just watching this round.
What an absolute gentleman, I could watch and listen to Poulter all day.
The amount of times Rick changed clubs after Ian had given him his advice and opinion was mad. That’s the difference between a good player and a pro. They see so much more than an average golfer and they don’t over think things. Brilliant video
What legend Ian is only bad thing with him is he’s an Arsenal fan shame
Absolutely phenomenal! Ian was just great! From him explaining the shot, to encouraging Rick, and playing to the camera! I’ve always been a fan of his but now I have a better appreciation for him! Thanks for sharing.
Way way way too many ads
Prrrrrroper enjoyed this video.
Rick, stop being so negative about your game. Positive thoughts..!!
Rick's face after Ian chips off the cart path shows his true respect and love for that game, great to see!
Watch ricks channel for years and this is my favourite video, poulter is just a top class personality
Really glad you sorted the 44min glich cis this is by far the best 10 shot challenge yet
The conference Ian has. I think I have to try that. Just have the confidence see the shot and hit it.
Easily my favourite 10 under challenge Rick. Ian is a legend. I really hope you play him again!
Fantastic video. Thanks Rick and thanks Ian Poulter. Great guest!
A great great video ians thought process is amazing well done rick
Ian Poulter ❤ legend
Best one I’ve seen….love Poulter
The approach Rick had at the 4 was one of the best short iron shots I’ve seen him hit.  Definitely better off trying to control that draw… it puts you off line more often than not
Fantastic episode,  Ian was brilliant so many things he does so well . Big shout out for Ian,s towel it played its part 😂
One of, if not the best video I have watched. Ian poulter, what a gent 👌
One of the best 10 shot challenges ngl. Great video, Rick!
Love it!
On hole 10 Rick on your drive you were very much set up for a slice i think if you just work on your alignment you could definitely eliminate those shots from your game. Personally I use to do the same thing and after tinkering with my setup a bit I fixed it.
Absolutely fantastic video. Ian Poultry is a star. Loved the way he explained the thoughts that the top golfers go through for every shot. Great passionate golfer and a legend in European Golf.
Love Poults. Really sad he went to LIV but maybe now we'll see him back on tour next year.  Great video
Dam!!😂
What a guy and great video ☝️
Production quality of this is incredible
This. Was. Fantastic!
An EPIC Epic. Ian is the GOAT an absolute true. English British European legend and warrior. Best match yet Rick.❤
Best video yet Rick! If you kept driver in the bag you'd have won!
This is the best video your have put out.  Period.
what a video, poults is such a genuine bloke ! pity hes a gooner thou lol !
By far the best video put out
Absolutely amazing video, thanks a lot Rick and Ian for the entertainment!
Rick what have you been eating.Time to give the 19th a miss.
I’ve loved every one the 10 Shot Challenge Videos so far. This one is my absolute favorite. Poults was absolutely amazing.
Are we not entertained!?! 😅❤
Everybody seems to praise Poulter as a great golfer but honestly, what has he achieved and what he has achieved is simply due to other people in team play. I just think he’s nothing but a loud mouth punk who is only interest is greed in blood money. Enjoy LIV Poulter, you have no chance of ever winning or featuring in the top 10.
Tricky tight course and another class vlog. Great to hear Poults thoughts on each shot and helping Rick out as well. I do think though it’s clear to see why Poults took the Liv money as he’s nowhere near the player he was and would probably struggle making cuts now on the PGA tour.
Along with the Adam Scott 10SC, that was my favourite. You could tell Poults really enjoyed doing it and wasn’t just there for the exposure. We need him back in the Ryder Cup setup now!
Really enjoyed the content Rick. Ian's amazing personality has contributed immensely to making this a great watch.
Amazing video! Ian is a legend, really like the guy now. If Rick can sort out his first tee nerves he might finally take down one of these tour pros
Liv forever  PGA never
Honestly, that’s the best video you’ve ever had on your channel….nuff said.
That was a great match! Forget the LIV nonsense poulter is a genuinely decent fella
Lucky dip 😂😂 relating to that
Best one yet Rick. Poults is just an amazing genuine bloke in both podcast and this.  Have been a huge fan for ages but even more so after this. Can even forgive his move to LIV now 🤣.  These matches have got to be one of the best series on YouTube, seeing the players in a more relaxed environment and feeling like you get to know them that little bit more than you would normally is brilliant. Great job to all the team that put these together……real class. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Fantastic video
Best one yet!!!
Great video, thoroughly entertaining!  What a fantastic bloke Ian Poulter is, his commentary and banter was insightful and so much fun.  Great camaraderie between you both. One on the best videos you have made, thanks to your whole team, great effort, beautiful in UHD
Absolute gold!  Here's an unfettered look into the mind of one of the world's best golfers on the golf course.  Ian is such a great gentleman, you could tell he was enjoying showing Rick his home course.  He was patient and kind throughout the match and has a keen sense of humor. Always been a fan of Ian but am even more so now.  Love the 10 shot challenges!!
Absolutely sensational episode well done Rick and Team
Rick please play all 18 holes with the confidence you had on the last hole in future, Ian just knew he had that putt in the bag when you missed yours awesome 🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♂️🏌️‍♂️👍
Poults is a legend. Great video
Ian’s face when you hit the tree 😂😂😂😂
Fantastic video - love these 👌
Where did you get them laser balls. I been asking in all the golf shops and all I keep getting is weird looks.  No help.
What a video! Thanks Rick!!!
Thoroughly enjoyable.  CHEERS LADS
i like so mutch Poulter, and you Rick are a kind person and great pro...ty
Best guest so far, hands down!
I would need 2 dozen balls if I played a round here.
IP what a gent.
That last hole, Ian absolutely turned up the gas and destroyed the hole for the win. but the man cheered Rick on and complimented his efforts, gave advice fetched the divots and turned a high five into a hug. Absolute class act.
What a great watch, thanks
Brilliant video!
Brilliant video, Ian was such a gent and a natural explaining his thought processes, great entertainment 👏👏👍
Watched it in a few stages, I think Ian can sometimes come across arrogant or cocky. Think this video will change a lot of people’s perspectives of him. An excellent watch, great insight into shot making and everything that goes with it.
I've always respected Ian as a golfer, but was never really a fan, I am now though 👍
Ian laughing at your shot on 17 made my day, he is awesome 😂
Brilliant Rick ! Poults top guy. Great to see you both (not at your best) dealing with situations. And WOW …how beautiful and tough is Woburn ! Bring on Stenson 👍🏻
Quality, the postman delivered 🤪 Mr Hatton next please Rick 👍
what an awesome video,Poults is an absolue Legend
I loved how much Ian was at ease, enjoying the battle and joking at the same time. You bring out the best in them, Rick.
As an Aussie, gotta say Ian Poulter has to be one of my favourite golfers 🏌️‍♂️
Love the 10 shot challenges, and this one was epic 🙌🏽 Poulter an absolute gent
What a brilliant vid. Poults was absolutely top drawer. His insight was superb. Great stuff guys.
Aaaand that's why Ian's on the LIV tour. He can't compete on the PGA.
Thank you for doing this video, Ian Poulter was by far the best guest you have had, his insight and knowledge is amazing. The way he views each shot is different class.
Love that Ian has Josh with him, getting some Dad time.
He pretty much was being a caddy for Rick and helping him find his ball and he was really funny. Great show Rick.
Ian is such a GENUINE human!  He deserves a gifted Ferrari from Rick having to put up with that front nine of his.  All in good fun  and loved the shot thought processing!
Without doubt best video u have done and I've watched in years LOVED it.
I LOVE this. Poulter's openness. It warms the heart. Reminds me of singers vs guitar players. Guitar players are toxically competitive and hateful. Singers love singers and share everything they know.
YouTube gold…👍🏻🤩❤️
Ian was just quality content and the insight into his thinking was amazing and how analytical he is was mega .....Great content love it
1:42:56 🤣 the way Ian turns around and tries to hold his laugh is priceless
Class
Ian Poulter phenomenonal man and golfer and Rick you played some amazing shots. GREAT VIDEO
Best one yet Poults is an absolute legend and a true Gentlemen. 👍👏👏
Has to be the best one yet what a gentleman Mr Poulter is.
Their voices are so similar hard to tell who’s talking when camera isn’t on them 😂
Excellent all round one of the best yet 👌👌
Ian poulter, what a lovely bloke. In a comp but caddying hard for rick. A true gent
Fantastic video. Hats off to Ian what a golfing icon. Massive respect. Rick, stop pushing driver right it’s killing your game. 🏌️‍♂️
Epic video Rick! loved this one! 👌
I wish Ian would’ve shown us how to do the hook shot Rick did on the 13th,,,
What a game, what a guy Ian is! Pressure building for Tour Pro’s nobody will want to be the first to lose
That was fantastic!
A true gent , this should be a sky sports programme,absolutely fantastic watching
@RickShieldsPGA - Your long shots reminds me of my own. Grip size fixed it.
Great episode!
From the Netflix documentary and this video I’ve really grown an admiration for Ian Poulter, top bloke! Wish him all the best for the future
What a awesome show. When you got to the 18th green I had to porse it go to the toilet and grab a beer 🍺 because all I was thinking was the first play off ever in the 10 under. Ian was so good with his commentary throughout the match. I would love to have a game with you two. Thank you loved it
Fantastic video, great insight into the course from Ian. Competitive but also great with advice and full commentary on each thought process for every shot was great to see.
I've always liked Ian and his style, but this video just shows what a nice bloke he is. Absolutely loved listening to his thought process.
That was great Ian is amazing would love to see more tour pro golf, I bet it's hard to get together with them touring all the time great video can't wait for the next one.
Poulter is an absolute legend! Really down to eartg and talking to Rick about hooding that iron shot and why he shoukd be taking a club less was brilliant to listen to. Favourite one yet
Best one yet!!brilliant
Best 10 shot challenge to date Rick and Poults was amazing for the time and help he gave.
Best guest ever. What a finish. Ian and Rick part two a must. Sydney AUST.
Another absolute gentleman.  It's great being able to listen to them on the podcast then see you play with them as it gives a really good insight into their mindset and personality. The more I get to know these players, the more I like them.  Thoroughly enjoyable, a cracker of a series.
Rick realising hes living his best life as they stood on the 18th was pure
Wow, great stuff! Mr Poulter super bloke - fun stuff! 🎉 Thanks!
Best video yet, wanted to hit the like button multiple times, Poults is such a legend!
Aww Rick, your golf is getting so bad its starting to give me Autism.
Ian poulter!!!!! Respect!!! Nice human being....
I don’t understand why you do this when you play pros. We don’t expect you to beat a touring professional golfer…  Say you beat one of these guys after giving yourself a 10 stroke head start… do you really feel good about that?   Isn’t it better to play straight up, lose by 6 strokes & show everyone just how good a touring pro is?  I just don’t understand the 10 stroke head start… when I watch these, I just add 10 strokes, anyway.
Love Poults, great video 👏🏻
Poults sometimes gets a hard time from peolpe,i met him once and he was such a decent bloke,Rick,the postman always delivers 😂
Best video you have ever done Rick, Ian Poulter talking through every shot was so interesting. This is the very reason you are the best youtube golf channel there is!
What a brilliant video so entertaining. How much would you give to see this man as captain of a rider cup team .Thanks guys Ian Poulter what a star.
I really enjoy these videos.  I hope you are able to have many more!
gone back to the old ways with the wedges, practice too hard? lol :P
That was AWESOME. BEST MATCH of 2023 to day. Lan Poulter is ALL Class. A great representation of the level of players on LIV Tour.
Great video, and Ian was a brilliant guest, true gent and what a laugh!
Poults is so good to watch. The Pressure of opponent is real, any other day you break 80. Great video and good finish 🍿
One of your best yet, IP was gent.
Can you do a review on the call away XR set?
Fml, my fave vid so far. Loved it!
Shiels is brutal. Every video!
what a nice guy Ian is
Absolutely brilliant video. What a finish!!
It had to come down to matchplay down the last.
Playing with these guys - wow what a dream - your smile when Ian commended your drive on the 5th was beaming! What a day and what a fantastic bloke Ian is!
This series and Break75 are the best on YT.
Nearly two hours??? You gotta be kidding me.
Absolutely brilliant.  So entertaining and enjoyable to watch.  Great to hear Ian talk through the thinking behind his shot choices.
Loved it! Ian had been a favorite of mine on the tour for years. Somehow always heard he was kind of a prick yet its clear to see he is absolutely the complete opposite. He's probably the most warm and fun tour pro you've had on.  So cool to see you both have fun and Rick... you got this... you were too close this time to have any doubts for the next round with a tour pro! Next vid is your win.
I love Ricks videos and everything he does on his chennels..... BUT I hate how he says damn in an American accent
What laser you using
he delivered again !
I've waited my entire golfing life to see Rick play Poults, com'on my son!!
Poults and Rick, what a Foursomes in Ryder 2023!
Always thought a lot of Mr Poulter but that must of been such fun as he talked so much. Real nice guy.
Poulter is a horrible, horrible person doing his own sportswashing
What a player,that is the science of golf,the best video so far.
great video great guest 👊
Saw a lot of hate for poults on the FB group, grown men saying they won’t watch as he’s a LIV golfer etc.  but without doubt the best 10 shot challenge to date. Their loss I guess. What a great match and Poults was a great guest. Keep up the good work. Rahm next?
ITS FIXED! Thoroughly amazing video. Ians attitude and openness is a delight from someone who is such a British legend of the game.
Honestly mate, best one yet. Loved all the pro videos as they as seem like top people. Ian is perfect on this, great commentary and just seemed like you had fun.
What a Gent Ian is. I need to say no more. THANK YOU 👍🏻
I love this course and I’m glad I’m not the only one to find it tricky 😐
Ian was awesome. Super hsrd course with all the trees. Watched tons of golf on youtube this is the best video yet
Ian also pacing and caddying. A gentleman.
Amazing fun to watch!   Ian is awesome.  I hate him a little less after whooping us in Ryder Cup all those times.  😏
I felt Ian was playing "rough" golf to make a match of it and give himself a challenge!
Great video Rick with my favourite golfer so entertaining  thank you😊
1:46:00 Rick became Wick Shiels the 'bogey man' nice putt!
I saw the best pitching lesson ever, recently, on rick's channel. Keep at it rick!!!!
Love ths video. Listening to how Ian works his way round the course is great and his caddie work for rick was?awsome
What a class video ! Ian is a mega bloke and great to hear his thoughts before each shot .  Maybe a video Rick with Rory ? See him bomb some drives
Honestly, I was hooked the whole way though! I felt like I was there with you. Thanks for sharing this with us, loved it. This is the best one yet, I’m going to follow Ian more closely, what a guy!!!
Awesome 🎉 Woburn looks majestic aswell
Access to level of talent like Ian shows not only the skill and course management but also that killer instinct that separates them from even +handicaps. Reminds me of when Wesley Bryan goes for the jugular.
I used to have a negative opinion of Ian Poulter but since watching Full Swing and now this my opinion has completely changed I’d now love to play a round with him!!!
An epic video.
This is like a movie! Hands down - this is the best Rick Shiels video EVER.
Shame video sync went halfway through,  was enjoying it
I don't think I have laughed this hard in a very, very long time.  Well done, mates. Well done.
That was a brilliant watch guys,Ian came across as such a nice guy
USA USA!!!! 🇺🇸   Like if you’re team USA!
Great content again Rick with a true legend, what a top guy - who's next
Epic watch. So much fun
Great fun to watch, great to hear Ian talk before the shots🏌🏻🟧
Is it just me or almost every fairway is crazily narrow? I think I would find just like 2 or 3 of my drives in the whole 18 😅
So good!! I just became an Ian P fan !!!
Ian looks like the old school fun loving decent chap type. Was hoping to see him rib Rick more but he didn't 😄
Only watched the first few mins so far, but dying on the inside for Rick on the first tee.  Medal comp, first tee 🫣
What an absolute star is Ian Poulter.  Legend. Great video Rick.
Better than any movie I've watched recently. Top work Ian and Rick
Poulter starts to sound like a mix between Michael Bisping and Tyson Fury.
Ian Poulter confirms what everyone else says about him. Fantastic video. Rick like a giddy school kid all the way through just brilliant guys 👌👍
We’ve all been there on the 17th! 😂 my ball is attracted to any tree in a similar position. A single sapling an inch wide at 20 yards and I’ll get it plumb! 😂😂😂 great film guys loved it 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
You should take on Shane Lowry. That would be a fun match
TBH, when rRck hit 2 balls of the tee i wanted to click off, but so glad i didnt. Ian is a great guy, and what a video. I was rooting for Rick's put to go in and when it missed i had my hands in my hair... hahahah... what a match....
Poulter is absolute class. What a genuine class act.  Best 10 shot challenge.
Ian was absolutely lovely! Polite, supportive, and just a bit cheeky! Perfect!
Listening to Ian’s thought process and shot creativity is amazing.
love Ian seems like a great guy. What a fun round
What an absolute immense video. Poulter and Westwood are my fav players. Amazing personality, a very creative and passionate golfer. True role models for the sport. The Postman always delivers 😊
Enjoyment spoiled by ad after ad after ad after ad
Ian is such a great human being.. He never once beat himself up once on bad situations.. he even encourage Rick and looked past the few holes encouraging him.. I love how Ian was happy to be there.
"oh my god that's bad." at 13:36 was so funny.
Totally an Ian Poulter fan...🙌🙏🏌‍♂️ WHAT a pleasure watching this match🫣😃💪👍 Remember watching Poulther winning at Simons golf club Copenhagen more than 10 years ago... 🏌‍♂️😃👍 Thanx Rick🏌‍♂️!😃
Without a doubt one of the best videos I've seen on your channel, Poults was great and the match went down to the wire.
Great playing Rick.  Keep trying buddy, your going to win one sooner or later😂
What a course and what a gentleman Ian Poulter is...some player !
What a ripping bloke. Commentary and insight from Ian was exceptional and truly informative of the mind of a pro. Great job Rick. Loved it all.👍
Man, the LIV golfers are so cool, nice and fun. They picked some good ones to join.
Ian is like Marmite. I don’t like Marmite! But I am a big fan of Ian!👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Man this video was great fun to watch thank you.
Excellent video Rick, both you and Ian made my Friday evening. It was a tremendous match. Thanks to you both for keeping every one entertained. I can’t wait to see who your next opponent will be. Take care guys and good luck to you Ian in your next tournament.
Rick gets so handsy and flippy when he's nervous. He needs a slight pause at the top and exaggerate getting through the ball with his body
REMATCH THIS ONE! great guest
Brilliant
Best one yet, what a gent Ian is he came across very well on the video. Keep up the great work.
Positively entertaining! Respect to Ian Poulter for his time and natural demeanor.  He was just enjoying playing some YouTube golf until he needed to turn on the pro golfer abilities to make sure that he didn't lose! So much fun to watch....thank you!
Excellent video guys, Ian’s advice was invaluable, great game ⛳️🇦🇺
Best guest so far. Ian was fantastic at the hole details and his shot explanation had some great tips.
That’s it. Ian took the belt for best guest on the channel.
Really wish I could give this a double like. Loved Ian's side comments. So much fun!!
I have realised watching Rick's videos that his first tee shots suck  so bad. Seriously, get your s**it together.
Great video, love these challenges. Rick you need to stop saying Dam in an American accent 😅
I didn't really to to Ian in Full Swing, but I am happy to eat humble pie and say i was wrong. Great content and an awesome guest.
Rick why don’t you keep a spare ball on you?  Having to go all the way back to cart for a provisional(s) seems easily avoided.
I’m now an Ian Poulter fan
This was fantastic!!! I would love to see you and Ian play scramble together against another tour pro + scratch amateur. The two of you working together would be epic.
Fellow Gunner.  Great video.
I really enjoyed this video. Ian is still an incredibly good player. I'm glad he's still representing us in the Ryder cup!!! Good job Rick 💪🏻👏🏻
Such a great video.
Damn
Best ever video. How can you not like Ian Poulter. Great insight to how they think on a golf course.
Ian was great
I can't watch!  Three holes in and🙈
For me, one of the best video's ever. Nearly 2 hours long but didn't feel like it. Fascinating how he worked distance and club choice out. Awesome guest and genuinely seemed to be having as much fun as you.
One of the best golf vlogs I've ever seen! Poulter was great and came across as a top bloke.  Even multimillionaire touring pros can replace their divots👏 Top quality content Rick!
Not watched the video yet, but you should win. Poulter is nothing more than a recreational golfer these days. Albeit well paid.
I already liked and respected IP but now I have whole new level of respect for him! The best 10 shot challenge yet!
I mean… is this the best video yet? Been a sub since 25k… this was incredible. Ian was fantastic. I was on the edge of my seat. Thank you Rick for making awesome content like this.
One of the best vids for sure. Ian and Rick just bounce off each other so well. Great watch. Well done lads
Poults is a lot of fun.  The most enjoyable of the series to date.  I could tell right away that he was off his game but what it came down to was the competitive spirit.  Another factor that separates a tour pro from the rest of us.
Although it would be impossible, I’d love to see a 2v2 consisting of the Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter, Rick and Guy. The banter would be amazing….although i think they would have to figure out how to make it fair and competitive (a scramble with a pro on each team would probably consisting of them taking the pros shots 75% of the time)
This is only marginally shorter than the titanic movie in length
Ian Poulter is an absolute legend. Anyone who loves golf has to think the same. Get Tyrell on please. I wanna see some on-course-fighting.
IP’s divot on 17. Damn 1:41:59
Love that it had the vibe of a couple of mates going at each other on the course but wants each other to do well.  Great vid sirs.  🫡
I clicked on the video knowing little about Ian Poulter other than his iconic moments throughout his career. I expected him to be a very entertaining person and so far he hasn’t disappointed. Never in a million years did I expect an invitation inside the mind of Ian Poulter! His knowledge of the course that he genuinely shared with Rick and his commentary of his thought process before every shot is such a pleasant surprise! Awesome video and I’m only 16:24 into it 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
It’s really great to see the personalities of the pros in these videos. Their banter really adds to the experience. Also there’s the course blog aspect when they act as a caddy and showcase the nuances of their course that you wouldn’t get anywhere else. So the only one you’re missing is Mr Stenson and then you’d have the Majesticks covered. Looking forward to the next one.
Epic content as always
Great video. Ian is made for this type of content. Fantastic insights, very very funny guy. His course management commentary is so good. Let’s hope we see Ian on the channel again.
Ian is such a class act. Love watching him on the PGA and here.
Looks like the hardest course I ever seen
Super excited for this channel! Congrats 🎉 My suggestion or wish would be to see a segment on 3,5, 7 woods. Why to choose each and/or best available for high and low handicap golfers. Cheers Rick and good luck!
What a guy! This was the best video so far. Thanks for the amazing content as always ❤
Already liked I.P. after watching Full Swing but he's just a fun guy out on the course and this video shows it.
I think I’ve seen literally everything you’ve posted & loved the lot … But this is just on another level … What an incredible, entertaining, fascinating,generous guest Ian was … Once again The Postman delivered !!!  Thank you Rick & the team … that & the podcast were magnificent
What a video! Mega content and even better golf! That perfect layup by going into the trees. :)😂
Trees fear RS
Loved the video, Ian is actually a pretty cool guy..👍
Rick, I love all your videos… but this one. This was in a league of its own! A featured pairing if I’ve ever seen one. Wonderful content, genuine chemistry and beautiful insight. Thanks to you and Ian both for all you bring to the game of golf! Much love ❤️
Another great video with a superb guest.
I would watch IP stack  fruit!
Ian is my guy.  Love this.
Ian poulter is just a normal bloke that’s just really good at golf not flashy and smug about it a has passion for the game it’s a shame they won’t let him in the Ryder cup his energy alone in that team is what won us them Ryder cups
Great video. Ian Poulter is a legend. What an finish too
Rick get out of your head bro. You are a good golfer. Stop worrying about the small percentage. Let the club release! You got it!
What a lad ian keeping it interesting
Ian is a much nicer guy than he is portrayed in the media. Rick it’s getting painful to watch your nerves. You are a better player than your self talk. Have some stones  man, get mad and play!
This might just be my favorite video you’ve ever posted Rick. It really had everything. Hearing Ian’s thought processes on his shots was so fascinating!
Great content, Poulter is a top bloke. Love this format, looking forward to the next one!
Rick you should play a round with Stephen Hendry!
Great video can't wait for the next one!!!
Best match so far, Ian made that so entertaining.
Am now a 🍗
Beautiful course, looks very tight from the video, absolutely love how personable these pros have been.
I can't believe i just watched 2 hours of this. It was great fun. Ian is the best.
there were barely any par 3's on this course. lol
If you want to beat any tour pro..My advice is to forget everything you were taught and focus on Todd Grave's single plane swing. It was handed down to him by the infamous .."Pipeline Moe Norman."
I am now an Ian Poulter fan... Awesome round..
This is a great 10 challenge. Ian is such a gentleman! A great sport and it looks like Rick and Ian are buddies playing on a Sunday morning. Love the content and the way both of you talk thru your thoughts. I did take Ian’s offset footprint on short chips to the sim after seeing it to try for myself and I am putting that in the locker! Thanks for that. BTW, if your watching these videos and want to have a little fun, take a drink every time Rick says, Right! Just saying. 😂 Love the videos and seeing Ian on the channel. Keep up the good work!
Love these matches and courses, this one was very tight, Ian was great on camera explaining his thought process and hilarious at times, Rick you need more positivity
Amazing video, not your best golf but still.
I miss seeing IJP playing . What a great video. So much to learn about the shots and how to think through the leave before hitting the shot. Great golf and great fun. Rick...fyi....when you get the first tee, the match is about start so, pull it together.
Absolutely loved this - IJP top man
It was great to see Ian start to really dig in on number 14 and show the insane talent that pros have. Both great sports, a gentleman’s broadcast that reminds me of Shell’s Wonderful World of Golf.
That was great, Rick.  Not often I watch the entirety of a 2 hour golf video.  Well done
Didn’t know Ian before this but I’m a huge fan now. Awesome video content and the editing was great ! Love the “poulter cam”
Ian Poulter is the absolute man.
I'm just now watching the tee shot on 2 and it blows my mind how you can play and know these pros and then all of a sudden you become a 20 handicap. And before I get bashed, I come from being a Assistant Pro and played with pro's and our course sponsored Duffy Waldorf and have played with him and never did I ever hit shots like this. It's just sad at this point.
My ultimate goal in life is to play a course in the UK at some point in my life. This course looks absolutely beautiful, as does every course in the UK. Ian is such a guy as well. Great match.
Seems to be working properly now. Great video Rick.
Best pro so far !
I wondered why this was so long, after the first hole i figured it out 😂
Rick, for god's sake pls get some lessons, you are embarrassing your guest.
PGA professional ??
Amazing
Broke 100 for the first time today! Let's go!!
Tightest golf course I have ever seen
Great match.  Playing with Ian Poulter looks like a relaxed, informative, and fun time.
Ian Poulter …what a legend….tough competitor, amazing golfer, and brilliant entertainer. If Ian is not made a Ryder Cup captain in the near future the gentlemen who administer our sport should hang their heads in shame! Another brilliant video Rick, truly entertaining…
Metiste un videaso ricky!
Not a fan of LIV players.  They gave up their legacy for money 💰.  I’m done with them.
Best 2 hours i spent today 🙏👏🏻
Cool to see how personable Ian was versus what I had previously known of him. Love your content! Wish we had your studio setup!
That was a bloody ripper to watch, great insights from Ian, and Rick you nearly had him!
I am loving the pacing and style of this video. Slower with shots held much longer. Call me old fashioned but I prefer this over fast cuts and truncated conversations. Well done to your filming and editing team. Lovely video. Don’t mind that it’s feature movie length.
One of my favorite videos! Poulter is class
Kind of seemed like ian was playing with his food front nine. Then got a shock when you hit a couple worldies. Great video probably my favorite so far!
This is the best, you tube video,I have ever watched.. I freaking love Poults..   I am American, so he has pissed me off,a couple of times...😏... Such, a Real Person..
The content without guy has been so refreshing!
Babe wake up, the new Rick Shiels dropped
Two legends. Enough said.
Really enjoyed this one, great work to both! Ian was an incredible guest and lots of fun. Loved the insight as well as how helpful and explanatory he was.
Absolutely one of the best matches you have played Rick. Love Ian and being his age I have followed him from the start of his career, what a gentleman. Well done gents!!
If Rick had holed out from the 18th fairway for the win, I think you’d have to shut down the channel.  Nothing could top that.
Rick this was your best video yet. The production keeps getting better and better. Listening to Ian share his thought process over his shots was great to hear. Keep these videos coming!
Rick in my opinion your best guest yet. Ian was an absolute gentleman and as you say amazing to hear the mind of an elite golfer doing their thing. As an Australian I would love to see you play a round with Ron Chopper from Ron Chopper golf.
My favourite one! Great episode Rick. From 🇨🇦
Wow wow wow, Ian’s the man!! Been watching golf for 35 years and seeing this side of him makes me a fan for life. Great video, pure class
I really thought reckon was a southern thing until Ian said it
That was an all-timer.  Loved that Ian was genuinely rooting for you and giving you good advice even though he wanted to win
Why didn't you try the chip slice 3 wood, thats right in my wheelhouse, I've had lots of practice 😂
Poulter's recovery shot on 7 was simply awesome. But I'm reminded that we can all play a shot like that now and again, it's part of the wonder of golf, those 'glimpses of glory' that keep us coming back. Ian seems like a fun guy to play a round with, and hearing him talk through his mind-set as he plays is gold. One of your best ever course vlogs Rick, well done.
Epic match. Best one yet. Loved it.🎉
I am an even bigger Ian Poulter fan now. What an entertaining round of golf!
Great video!
Ok so now I've stopped laughing at the title, I'll settle in and watch the carnage!
Best one yet!
I don’t think he will invite you for the Ryder Cup team.
Very entertaining. Drama, comedy, everything you could want. I've always enjoyed Ian Poulter (except in the Ryder Cup😅). What a class gentleman. His openness with his thoughts pre shot is truly eye opening and explains why tour pros are so very good.
💯% pure gold content. Ian didn’t simply participate in the 10 shot challenge, he performed and demonstrated an appreciation for us viewers. I've always liked him as a golfer, but I'm now a legit fan and will root for him whenever he's in a field.
Absolutely amazing video! Ian is such a good sport! I could never play that course... I would need 2 cases of balls lol
That rip spin on the 18 Rick was insane!!! Great shot but dang!
No chance I’m sitting thru this, sorry Rick
I absolutely love seeing this side of the pro golfers.  So fun to watch.
Always been a big Poulter fan but seeing him in this element has made me a life long follower, what a legend!
wow! watched every shot. couldn't have been better if it was scripted!
What a great guy! Absolutely the most humble guy you've ever played. Kudos!
Awesome video!  Love the sportsmanship and the proper English manners!  😂 Love hearing Poults thought process and his professionalism.
That was absolutely wonderful. Poultry was splendid. So cool to hear him talk each shot (yours and his). Well done.
What a great episode! So much fun to watch.
Poor Rick fed to the wolves ! Good banter and the commentary was brilliant!!
This is absolutely the best one yet! Phenomenal video. So much fun. Ian is so good on camera!
What a finish!
I like how Ian turns and looks at camera when Rick hits a bad shot.
Are you not entertained?!
Awesome video. Really enjoyed hearing the thought processes from you and Ian. Still watching but the Like, subscribe, just deal with it really got me laughing. That should be your new channel motto.
This is the collaboration I had been hoping for. This round combined with the podcast is the best content on YouTube. Thank you and well done.
What you LIV for .... 1:08:41
Absolutely phenomenal.  I've always been a huge fan of Poults and this was topnotch.  I think if I could play a round with anyone in the world, I would be hard pressed to pick anyone better than Ian.  I would have wagered $1,000 for him making that putt on 18...there was just no doubt of him making it!  Great course, great banter, great editing, and so-so golf.   lol
This is my second favorite after tommy
Sorry.. No time for Ian Poulter.. Kind of surprised you did this
Thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this video. So cool to hear Ian talk through every shot. Superb!
ℹ absolutely enjoy watching these vs. videos with pro pga pro golfers.  I hope you can have a more consistent series like the 75 series
Poulter what a guy and Woburn amazing!
Your hole 6 is what we, in America, call a PBFU...post birdie  fk up...
That 18th hole was epic!
eureka! it's fixed...such a good episode i watched it with the wonky sound and will watch again properly...ian was fantastic...
This is the type of course to test how good you are, I hate when they play wide open corses that don’t penalize when you hit a bad shot.
2 hours of pure happiness. thanks Rick, and thanks Mr. Ian "Medinah" Poulter. For eternity. Cheers, and peace
Ian was a gem.
Is it me or Rick has now got some nice cakes now 😏
Ok Rick, that was absolutely one of the Best and Most entertaining 10 Under rounds I think you've played!  And with Ian Poulter, Wow what a cool guy and a real gentleman. The two of you knocked it out of the park and I am into the hearts of everyone who has the opportunity to view this gem. Well done and thank you for bringing such wonderful content to all of us You Tube viewers...Damn!
i enjoyed this... I think I will watch it again..
Bro. Too many ads
The best ten shot challenge yet! What a great guest not only in this but the podcast too! Be sure to get him back again sometime!
As an American. I taught myself to Hate Ian!!!!! After this. No way. What a gentleman and a really good person. I actually would go out of my way to say hello to him and follow him on tour. Thanks Rick and Ian
Have to say this was the only one to make me laugh. Good stuff rick and how cool is Ian as a person ? Brilliant watch
Fantastic ending! Well done Rick. Sooo damn close
When you start talking about hitting a soft, open face, chip three wood slice, you know you've been playing this game for too long.
Best. Video. On. YouTube.
Amazing video!
Hands down without a doubt my favorite episode to date!
My biggest takeaway was how Ian would look a the trees for the wind on every shot. I have to implement that on my own game
This is LEGENDARY content! Thanks to Rick & Ian!
My man🎉 WTF
Best 1
All the 10 under challenges have been entertaining.....Ian really made this one especially entertaining, would love to have pint with him.  10 on 10 for this one Rick....loved it.
Thoroughly enjoyed that! Thanks Rick & Poults! 🏌🏿‍♂️☝️
Ian seems like the kinda guy you would want to go have a fun round of golf with... Seems very genuine out there.. Love it.
Best one yet!! Love Ian talking. It's not going in. He is going to pull it!! Lol
Top man, Poulter is.
That was one of best youtube golf videos I have ever seen. Well done both Rick and Ian! 👍
I have to say this was one of the most enjoyable video to watch. Mr. Ian is absolute gold of a person, from seeing him on the Netflix series and now Thanks you both for the 18 🏌️
Great great watch. Class.
super great video Rick
Amazing video
Golf must be BORING AF to these pros....
Such good content! Ian seems to be a very good guy. If only you could’ve holed that wedge shot or sunk the putt on 18!!
Maybe my favorite so far. Great match, love seeing Ian ramp up when it got to game time
I love this content. You can see the genuine excitement Rick gets when Ian gives him compliments. Shout out to your production crew as well. This was one of your best pieces of content and i enjoyed every minute of it. Looking forward to watching the Good Good material!!   ALSO! I feel like every pro who has played you has had a top 15 finish within a year of their appearance on the channel (shout out Rickie for winning Rocket Mortgage!) here’s wishing Ian a ton of success in the near future.
I wish Rick had more confidence in himself. He plays too scared he needs to just get loose and keep his head level.
6:10 poulter looking bored already 🤣🤣🤣
Amazing video!  Ian not only started with a ten stroke deficit, but also acted as caddie to Rick. Brilliant pre-shot commentary. Poulter is also rather witty and entertaining. Good stuff!
Mr Poulter was an absolute gentleman, first rate player and a classy sportsman as well. Well done. My favorite part was watching Mr. Poulter turn on the competitive fire the last few holes and drill shot after shot. True professionals can find that “extra gear” that the rest of us mere mortals just do not have.
so cool to see these legends on a personal level like this. Amazing series!
What!!!   How lucky are you.👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Great video! I love learning from you and the pros
Poulter Comes across as such a good guy. Great video Rick
….after the first few minutes just assumed it was two hours of Rick blazing provisionals into the woods
Poulter is a legend.
What a legend. I like that he's not wearing a hat.  You can see his face.
Amazing guy Ian thank you!!!! Rick thank you for the video we all needed
Favourite Golfer Favourite YouTuber  Best video ever ❤it!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
What a great episode...it's impossible not to love Ian
As an American I didn’t much like Ian. (Ryder Cup) But after watching him on the  Netflix series, he’s starting to grow on me. Great content Rick.
Love Rick to pieces but cant help but think Poulter deliberately "just" missed 2 shots there :)
I’ve been waiting for this video since you took a pic with Ian
Dudeeeeee! What an excellent video! Super entertaining and was so into every minute of it
Superb
This video has changed my perception of Ian.  The way he helps around the course and his patience is awesome to see.
I wasn't a fan of Ian before, now after watching this, huge fan! What a fun guy
Rick, the Pec punches on 17 were epic!  Poulter... much respect for the competitiveness!
What a great video. What a fun guy Ian is! He may not have been playing at his best but he showed the quality that the Pro's have to get up and down when they need to. His personality made that video so much fun to watch. Well done Team Sheils. Another quality video for us all to enjoy.
Absolute best video you’ve filmed. Ian is so gracious and giving. Love this Rick!
I don't recall you ever having 2 iron in the bag. You trying to show off in front of Ian or was this a new addition haha
Gotta say, this video made me an Ian Poulter fan. Loved all of the insight into his thinking around the course. More please!
That was classic Rick. Ian was such a good guest/competitor ✌️💥
Ian Poulter really surprised me with how friendly he was , and a generally great sense of humor. And he’s also great on camera!
Amazing video. Well done to all involved in this one.
Awesome! What a great watch. Ian Poulter was fantastic, a true legend. Really enjoyed listening to the thought process to the shots. What a great guy! Get Cam Smith out next!
A great video Rick, Ian Poulter comes across as a great mentor for you.  Some of the things that Ian is thinking about before each shot I have never even considered before.  The course where I play has a lot of trees, so it's good to see his thought process for getting around the course.
This was great! Seriously the best one yet!
Real entertaining and educational. Its now Ian Poulter and Adam Scott who are my favourite golfers on this series. All so close, but unfortunately Rick, that last iron just spun a little too much. Awesome stuff!!
My favourite guest so far!
Great video Rick. Just get annoyed every time you say “damn” with that weird US accent.
Man.. I'm watching hole2.. this is brutal so far 😂
"Just try and slightly fade on in there" haha good one
I absolutely love these challenges.   Anxious to see who’s next!
That was oh so good. Loved how Ian described how they should play each shot. Fantastic video Rick.
No.
What a great fella poulter is  Great match
WHAT A PLEASURE 🙏 TO HEAR THE THOUGHT PROCESS OF A SUPER CHAMP 🏆 👏 👍 😊
Time to switch drivers Rick. That G425 ain't cutting it anymore. But great video. Class act by Ian.
Are they not playing the tips?
I've never predicted a shot more than rocks second on 17. That tree was aleays going to take a hit
LIV? No thanks
POOR SHIELSY BABY 👶 😊❤
Did I just become a big Ian Coulter fan? I THINK I JUST DID!
His commentary and thought process is awesome. This series is my favorite of all of yours and this might be the best episode of the series.
It's weird, after almost 20 years of not liking Ian Poulter, to kind of like him now. Between Full Swing, the podcast, and the round with Rick here, he seems like a pretty nice guy.
Quality Quality Quality
Fantastic, Ian Poulter great guess, amazing to hear his thought process when playing his shots. Thanks Ian & Rick
Why did your strokes jump from 1 to 3 after the provisional ball on the second hole?
What a great match. Ian seems like  good giy
i was at medina watching poulter...it wasnt fun as an american
By far the best one of these. Ian was great to watch and hear his thought processes!
Great content as always. As someone that works in sports productions the audio levels on the mics are peaking and distorting a little.
Outstanding!
It would be cool to see Rick play against some older legends of the game as well maybe with Rick starting at 5 under. Hearing the course thoughts and stories from some players like Fred Couples, Nick Faldo, or even Bernhard Langer or Greg Norman would be incredible.
This was freaking awesome!! Poulter is the best!
The postman truly living up to the name
again way to much shot calling on shot shaping find a go to and stick to it unless you have to shape it
I’ll just slightly fade one in there, play a draw perfect 😜😂😂😂
ABSOLUTELY EPIC!😙
Always liked Poulter, comes across as just a genuinely nice bloke and it shows again here. Favourite 10 Hole Challenge yet even though Rickie is a favourite of mine!
The pro matches are great!
Audio is still out of sync. Enjoying the banter so far.
So much fun seeing Ian and Rick, I really hope this becomes a regular outing, both of these guys make for an entertaining round
That was the best match yet!!!!😊
No you can’t the answer Is no all the time you can’t win you can’t break 75 you are an average player at best who got so lucky in life I’d beat you by at least 6 shots
I genuinely root for Rick as much as I do any athlete, professional or not.
Rick is so time for you to change that going to the right going to the left driver.. gotta say the best part of the video was hole 17 on Rick's second shot
Great film Ian polter info is gold
Ian is such a humble genius and perfect for camera. This was an amazing video. Bloody good 2 hours.
just calm down Rick.  you know how to golf.  take a breath, get out of your head
This is easily one of your best videos to date.
Absolute insane amount of ads on this video!!!
Lol it’s no way in hell Rick is a pro golfer😂😂😂😂😂😂
One of your best  Camera work was the best I’ve seen  Great intimacy and competitive gaming  Very cool golf  Bravo
Love Rick. But why on earth he doesn’t just stick to his draw is beyond me. All the best players (excluding maybe Tiger) 9/10 times play a stock shape. Trying to hit “baby cuts” and ending up hitting high draws is just not a good look for a guy who teaches us all to keep it simple.
Does Rick kick his ball marker at 34:00 ?
Brilliant to watch. Rick is pleased that Ian had a bad day!
Best video I’ve watched in a long time. Really built from fun round with a tour pro into match play-style drama, with some of the most ridiculous shots along the way and a grandstand finish.   Didn’t know how I would feel about IP at the start given there has been some brash media commentary and I’m no fan of LIV… but he is great! Funny, witty and came across as really genuine - and showed why he’s famous for these 1-1 showdowns. Great content, Rick and team!
I could watch you two play a round a hundred times. It was like watching two old friends play. You guys have great chemistry
Wow, Poulter has such great on screen presence and personality.
I loved the content but the mistake in editing made it unwatchable. It not something I would expect from a channel at this level.
Missing Plug-in ⚠️
What an episode! The way Ian takes the time to explain his thought process through each and every shot was fantastic, what a gentleman. Great content as always, right up there as one of my favourites. Thank you.
Hole 5 approach you said you wanted to fade it in there, you hit a 10 yard DRAW, and rightly so to be so happy with the result, but no mention about your intention to fade the ball... i dont get it....................PUTT ON 17 SUPER GOOD, THE WAY YOU PLAYED 18 WAS MAJESTIC RICK. GREAT CONTENT.
Poulter's look after holing the putt on #1. What a formidable opponent!
This was outstanding on so many fronts! Poults was fantastic providing commentary and shot explanations. Thoroughly enjoyed his candor on the podcast as well. Well done, Rick and Poults!
Rick, until you take a lesson I can't watch these anymore.
Poults needs an inhaler - sounding very chesty 😂
Disappointed in the lack of flair from Ian’s pants
Totally changes my perception of Poulter. What a guy!
I used to hate Ian. After watching this, seems like a nice enough dude.  Though he did still get a guy who heckled him on Twitter fired. Then he tried to do it again to another guy. Kind of a dick move. 😆 A millionaire athlete taking someone’s livelihood away. A guy with a family. For a benign piece of trash talk.   Okay, I’ve changed my mind again. I hate Ian Poulter.
I would literally never have recognized him without his visor
audio out of sync :-(
“Lots can happen yet tho”
The best 10 shot challenge yet! Poulter is not only a great golfer, he is an entertainer and a decent guy to boot.  I think challenging Stenson is a great idea, too. Looking forward to it. Woburn is a tough course!
Best one yet Rick!
For me the audio and video didn’t match up after about the 7th hole, it then became unwatchable.
Unwatchable after 44 mins. @richshielsPGA
Great content, Ian is hilarious
I like that guy
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
HE'S so bad now a days :D
Is it just me that noticed the “missing plugin” screen and the disconnect between the audio and the video afterwards? Was only able to watch half the video before that happened and became unwatchable. Disappointed cause I was looking forward to this video :(
Been a long while since you've had a big name on here. Good to see it ❤
Loved this Rick and would like to see more of Ian, could you set up a match at the old course?
Rick, you need to push the turf toward the hole when fixing a ball mark. Your method usually kills the grass since the root system underneath is severed.
IMPORTANT!!  If you are having audio sync issues, just close the video, or go back to the youtube home page, and open the video again, it should sync the audio back up. At least that worked for me.
Loved this episode, really really enjoyed it!
Ian is just pure class . What a great video !
Poulter is out here saying he is "scared of back spin". If I spin the ball back 3 inches, I feel like a tour pro.
❤poultz
Well what a gentlemen Ian Poulter is. Really enjoy that and now have an early tee time to get to with no sleep. Well worth it though great video guys
The Postman delivers again
Should have played against Charley Hull as well!
1:43:10 had me actually crying of laughter. What a hilarious moment
Amazing! Thank you both so much! The 1 on 1 with one of my all time heroes! the  thoughtfulness to share such professional insight (not from you Rick 😮)…and true to form, the Postman delivered on the last! As you often say Rick …”UNBELIEVABLE!” Will remain among my absolute RS favourites…
Poulter is pretty nice guy!
Best Rick Shiels video ever? Got to be up there…..
The 18th was amazing! Rick almost sunk it twice! Great video. I hope each your pro you play makes a recommended challenge and it keeps going!
Lovin' it....superb once again! - Rick, it was a brilliant double act....I agree with the other comments, you should try and make this game with Poults an annual event!
Videos like these are why Rick is my favorite YouTuber. What a video! And what a finish!
Most beautiful course I’ve seen on this channel!!! Stunning!!!
Love you Rick
Man if I was as worried about my game as you I would never play golf 😂
How did y’all get through the first couple holes.  I was sadly embarrassed for Rick.  That was just rough, I had to tune out.  It can not only be nerves every single time you go out.  One day you will look at your grip and swing as you overcook your “draws” and hit straight hooks.  Eventually after your 25+ yrs you need to find the antidote to those nerves!
Best golf video on YouTube, fantastic viewing
Had to turn the volume down as your whinging and talking is driving me crazy, wondering if your an only child. Lovely that Poulter gave his time to do this, love LIV.
That's not just a tour pro and Mr Ryder cup. That's a full scale Gooner. You had no chance. UP the Poults
What an absolute treat to hear Poulter talk through his thought process, fantastic video!
Get me some of that Ian Poulter vs Rick more often! So hilarious and good video, thank you!
spoiler alert rick spoils every hole after 44 minutes 😂
Really enjoyed this because Ian really talked through every shot he played, really good to listen and learn 👍
In mine, Poulter has the hair highlights and checkered pants on some of the later holes . . . if can't fix, no sweat. 😂
Absolutely love Ian, but you are still the man Rick!
I was only going to watch first 10 mins before coming back to this later. Just couldn’t stop. Awesome  match! Ian is just class. Such a fluid natural player, full of insight. Loved it. Thanks to you both and the team
My sound and video sync went off around 7th hole, tried to reset etc but still behind, anyone else same issue?
maybe one of the best 😂, The Postman is so cool ! But please Ian, put that left leg in the car pleeeeeaaaaase
Missing plug-in??
Just need to tabs going at the same time playing the audio ahead behind the video and that should work. lol
This has to be an annual match. What a great guest. Huge fan of Poulter now.
1:22:47 Don’t want to be a narc, but one shot penalty against Ian on hole 14. The ball moved as he addressed it! Social golf I know 😊
I’ve hated Ian forever because of Ryder Cups. Not anymore. What a good dude. Much respect. Compete!
1.43.10 is absolutely hilarious 🤣 Ian laughing creased me up, belter match 🙌
Hearing Ian’s swing thoughts made this video incredible
Am I the only one with audio/video sync issues?     (Great video Rick!)
Brilliant video! Ian Poulters shot commentary was great, some great shots and great banter between you both. To finish with tense 18th hole, shame we didn’t get a better shot of your first putt!
Anyone else notice that when Rick says ‘damn!’ It comes out in an American accent?
What a match! Rick, you almost had him. Ian Poulter was a class act helping you with shots and reads on the green. It was awesome! Loved it.
@RickShielsPGA 's face at 33:28 is absolutely priceless. A mixture of disbelief, admiration and pure joy. Love these matches, keep 'em coming!
Over the last 6 to 8 months anyone elce finding it harder and harder to watch these videos with the way Ricks game has just fallen apart he really needs to stop trying to kill the ball every shot and slow his swing down and admit he cant hit the ball as long as he once did. His scores would improve so much hitting from further back but in the fairways.
Ian is gold on camera. Such a good video!
500 adverts is a bit much
Best yet mate!
Probably the best golf video ever. Ian was awesome with Rick. Seems like a great guy and fun to play with.
Fan of Poulter now
83 is respectable 🏌‍♂️
Loved this
Poulters a weapon, ricks a charlatan. Is a perfect match and a great watch
this is the worse Ive ever seen Rick play. i mean even the shape of his tee shots looked weak
Easily the best guest for -10 challenge. Ian was relaxed and chill. Fun and interesting conversations. Too bad there was an audio delay of about 10-15 seconds
No matter what, for me Poults is class.  Great golfer, great family man with great chat.  Awesome video Rick.  Thanks my man!
Excellent…yet again..
That course looks hard!
That was a quality watch. Great video Rick.
What’s up with the audio ?
This was a quality video! Can’t help but love Poults
I’m starting to think I can beat Rick. And I’m a 12 hc
Well done Rick Shiels, without doubt the best video you have done..  you are the people's champion !
That was as good as it gets, brilliant stuff…Poulter made me feel like I was just outside the ropes with a front row seat..👍🏌️‍♂️🇨🇦
Love Ian poultry this is great video he is one of my favourite golfers Rick this match/video is a masterpiece
Love these episodes. From USA so probably have cursed Ian Poulter more than once, but found him to be awesome in this video. Love how he turned the switch on at the end. I am a new Poulter fan. Great stuff.
Ian seems so helpful with advice and tips when playing 🏌🏻⛳️
Rick and his double doubles 🤣
Ian is top bloke,he was brilliant here and did it all for nothing more than his time.
Ian has always been one of my favourites. It was great to hear his thought process on each shot. Great vid Rick
Great vid my fav out the 5
I've only watched the first hole and already Ian is the best pro Rick's played with.
What a lovely bloke and a YouTube natural 👍🏼💙
The way that Ian finished on the 18th gave me the impression that he might have been toying with Mr Shiels just a little bit for the other 17.
My favourite so far. Stenson best be onit
Played Woburn Dukes a few years ago for charity. When you pull into the car park and see someone as good as Mr Poulter has his own parking space, you know you're at a special golf course. What a place Woburn is
Rick is obviously a very good player, but when he does these 10 ahead challenges, he plays the first 4 holes like me!
Great game, Poulter would make such a nasty pennant player the one everyone would avoid to play but the person who any captain would pick first!!!! I reckon he may be a good option for a Ryder cup captain ????😂😂😂
Ian Poulter! What a great guy! Love this.
I love your videos but I think you are getting worse.
I love Poults and he used annoy me but in reality he's so down to earth hilarious and truly loves this game
Great video despite the audio being out of sync. Best yet😎
2hrs?
Epic!
This was a brutal course. So tight. No place to bail out!  Really enjoyable.
What a great personality Ian has. Fun to watch.
This was great!  Poults was awesome!  Fun to watch 😎. Keep these coming. Hopefully one day Rick can play the Big Cat!
Is a shot gun start?
Is this really Ian Poulter? It's not a lookalike like that Messi lookalike?
FYI the video and the sound went out of sync.
R mate absolutely loved the video. Proper class that and what a guest poulter was. LEDGE👏🏼👌🏼👊🏼
Rick. Says missing pugin on the 7th. Hit me up when we all can resume.
Top video Rick proper enjoyed it thank you 🙏
Always good to see Bluey come out of the bag.  Served you well on the second shot on 11.
Always wondered if you would play better in a looser jacket, try a thermal top under a t shirt... worked wonders for my yoga movement...
Damn!! By far my fav video.
Around the 40 minute mark the sound came unsinced with the video. 😢😢
What a great video this is my favourite by far
This is one of the best matches yet. Just hearing the thought process from such a great player is priceless
Fantastic video shame about the sound.
Rick calls a fade and hits a draw lol nearly every time! 👏 enjoyed this one 👍
Electric
Rick you need more strokes 😅
Great video, very entertaining, but the audio going out of sinc ruins it
One of the most enjoyable gold videos I have ever seen. As has been said - Ian - gent and golf genius..
Great video but can’t believe how many adverts I had to watch😩
Nobody else noticed how the sound is sooo out of sync from hole 7 onwards?
Rick with a straight 25 ft eagle putt so IP says “it’s a tricky green”, hilarious
Great video… Wasn’t a big Ian Poulter before (Ryder Cup Nemesis) but he seems a pretty cool guy..
I think that has to be your best video you have done absolutely brilliant. Ian Poulter what a absolute STAR
Very cool, playing Ian Poulter.
Just class Ian poulter is, legend
Daemn!
Orlando for part 2 sounds 🔥 🏌️‍♂️⛳️👍
Can you? Who cares!?
Great video. I think the audio might be a bit lower than usual?
Enjoyable,  the iceman match player was never missing that putt on 18!
Awesome  What irons mr poulter using
Im 30 mins in and that's all I can watch... Pouter is brilliant I just can't watch ricks terrible golf any more..
AFter about 45 minutes does the audio and video go out of sync?
1:14:00 I’ve just paused it ….not watched rest honest but at this point this shot selection is my guess where Rick hands it to Ian lol.
Just loved this video! Thank you
That was an awesome round to watch you guys play. Poulter was a great guest and loved to hear the thought process before he takes his shots. Rick that last hole was great I thought you were gonna take the sun.
What a course I've been lucky enough to play it and wow and I agree this should be annual as poulter is just class
Rick played miles better, Ian giving him the rocket, too negative
i loveee these vids
BEST. MATCH.YET! Really enjoyed this one
That was a great match , great shots , some great saves and very intertaining … best 10 under par
Can’t wait for 20 shot challenge v Rory hahahaha
I think Ricks nerves tend to get the best of him when he plays the big names! Which is  understandable ! Then when he settles down he seems to play better!  Rick .... just start off playing the percentage shots ... don't try too hard ... get the ball on the fairway early doors  and the confidence  will  follow  naturally
The📮👨always delivers what an absolute legend your best video ever bud. At one point on the video Rick you where just in awe standing there thinking how has my life changed so much from the young lad on trafford driving range to playing on top courses with some of the best players in our sport.. Well done fella your hard works paying off.
I like the way rick beat the heat by keeping it under the trees as much as possible.
Maybe if you offered him lots of money like LIV he’d sell his soul again and let you win
Poulter seems like a perfect guy to play with.
Some of the most entertaining golf I’ve seen ever!
Top draw stuff
Jesus that course looks hard af. Miss off the tee and your hoping for bogey.
Love all three courses there.
That is some top-notch respect for your clubs from Poulter
One of the best you’ve done Rick. Learned lots from Ian. Good stuff
Such a shame that a really great video was spoilt after 50 mins or so by the audio being out of sync. Any chance you can re-edit and re-post. Thanks guys
Rick maybe stop trying to shot shape and focus on hitting it straight!
Didn't think much of Ian prior to this video.   Turns out he is a very likable fellow when he isn't playing against the USA in the Ryder Cup :)    Looks like he needs to work on the putting some, but his game is still quite impressive.
The best golfing video I’ve seen on YouTube, course is unbelievable and Ian down those last few holes was scary! Great job as usual keep this format coming made my Friday night 😊
Playing on tree lined courses are some of the toughest courses to play on. If you can’t get yourself out of trouble in amongst the low hanging branches, multiple tree trunks in your line. You’ll never score well. They’re courses that show true skill and touch in shot shaping and maintaining confidence on limiting the damage
The thing I like most about these match ups is that it’s purely about the match between them, no other questions about anything else.
Great video. The commentary from Poults is a great insight into what goes on on top players minds as they consider a shot.
Death taxes and rick starting terribly
was loving this until the audio didn't match the content it was like and old Bruce Lee film 🤣🤣
These adverts are RIDICULOUS
The Circle T Proto SCOTTY!
Simply brilliant 👏
One of my favourites
That course seems unbelievable tight.
I'm getting a "missing plugin" warning at 44:27 then a time delay between audio and picture after. Anyone else getting this?
What a match! Rick easily your best vs pro yet! I could have listen to Ian’s shot analysis for hours! What a legend! RYDER CUP LEGEND 😀
Great video, my opinion of Ian Poulter has gone up massively after watching this!!! The format of these videos gives great insight to how the pro’s play the course and is very interesting with the shot choice, I think Bob MacIntyre should be your next pro to play. Keep up the good work Rick, Lorn 🎉
18th hole was the best
I found myself inadvertently just cheering for Rick:  "C'mon Rick, hit a good shot here!"  Even though this is probably a month old!  Couldn't help myself!
Did anyone else think they were going mad when the audio went out of sync?! Hope YouTube get it sorted for you, can't wait to watch the rest.
State of it.. you’re a 10 over par player at best.. hard to watch
Why does Ian look in the sky when reading the wind? How does that work? Lol
Ian is great.  It's awesome to see a super star like Poulter unwine in his home element..
Poulter is not daft playing round his home course, although I don't think it would matter what course it was
Is the audio broken?
What happened to the sound kept dipping in & out after 46 mins
It's a shame the adverts make this unwatchable
Ian p gave me a ball one time at a tour event.  He played probably the worst hole of his life gets to the next tee box.  He throws the ball off of the tee marker picks the ball up and tosses it at me.  Before I could catch it a event worker stuck his hand out and caught it and Ian yells. “Give it to the kid”    Made my year
Superb. The way Ian was talking through your shots as well as his own was so generous. Hard to top this Rick!
Great video Rick. Lee Westwood should take note that’s how a pro should play. Ian was competitive but also helpful and supportive. Loved it
Can we talk about the solid dap at the end there. What an echo.
If that was phil in the trees on the 1st he would’ve pulled a 3 wood and hit a massive pull hook. A push slice would’ve been pretty easy to do there too :)😊
Rick pulled a Keegan Bradley on that pre shot routine with the wedge in to 18.
Easily the best guest so far
awesome 😎
Ay look, fair play to Rick haha! I would crap myself playing with these top players! The shakes would never stop haha
Had to abandon after 40 mins because of the audio. I'm never getting that time back 😡🤬
Soooooo many Ads....! Enjoyed the video though.
Easily the best video I have ever watched on this channel.  Ian’s character is just made for YT and you’d have thought they had been mates for years. Brilliant 👏🏻
Another amazing 10 shot challenge! These are the best golf videos on youtube, hands down. Rick and the all the Pro's have made it so fun and entertaining. I knew Ian would great. This is up there with my favorites so far.
Wouldn’t expect anything different than an epic battle to win from a Ryder Cup legend! Thank you Mr. Poulter for sharing your thoughts and how you see and approach your shots !!! 👊🏻 You can clearly see the next gear and intensity he has when winning is on the line !! Great video!! Mr. Shiels 👌🏼
This is why Rick is #1. Absolute gold!!!
Amazing video and big Poulter fan. Was great on the pod cast and even better on the video.
Audio sync totally spoiled this Rick.
Best bit... Rick asking,  can I call you Poults yet? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. Loved it
Struggling to watch Rick videos lately, that hook is terrible. Appreciate golf is bloody hard but for someone that plays so much he’s getting worse. Not good to watch sorry Rick.
rick get your tongue out his arse
Great video. Ian Poulter's continuous, insightful, informative and interesting dialogue just elevated this to the next level. A word also for the course, too. What a place! One of the hardest looking courses I've seen!
This was incredible. You just have to love Poulter. Such a good dude.
Ian Poulter may be as funny as Peter Finch. What a great time I had watching this.
Too many adverts
Rick  That is the best video you have ever made 👏👏👏
Boys that was awesome. The way Ian talks about what he’s about to do with his shots is quite amazing and the cheeky little banter shots on camera was bloody funny. Loved it Rick my favourite by far.
People wonder what the difference is between a range pro and a touring pro is, you've just seen it right there, that was poulter in probably his worst round on his home course
Please challange STENSSON
What a fantastic video absolutely loved watching it, proper made me laugh throughout. Before this one my favourite 10 shot challenge was the Adam Scott one but I think this has just pipped it, Ian was  one of my favourite golfers growing up and still is.  Can't wait for the next 10 shot challenge  Keep up the great work and the fantastic videos rick
Great video rick
Man Ian Poulter is the best! Enjoyed every second of this video!
RE-upload it to YouTube, it needs to be reprocessed to fix sync.
27:55 Rick just club tosses on Ian’s behalf 😂
Lately Rick been fading nearly all his good drives...but you said draw🤪 hopefully improves after hoke one lol
What’s the majestics thing on poults shirt? Noticed no sponsors either is that his sponsor????
Ian Poulter what great guy and professional. Quality You Tube with good company.
Really enjoyed this one, all the pro's have been great to be fair, Poults banter was a lot of fun. On the podcast and the course he comes across as a genuinely nice guy. Looked like a tough course to navigate so level seemed to be a very decent score.
Totally, enjoyable! I can't remember when I laugh so hard.😂
Go on holiday, come home, 18 hole lark with Rick, shoot evens🤣
Awesome video but audio levels are clipping at times which I can’t stop hearing now 😢
Currently watching hole 17. The ONLY reason Rick is going to lose this is poor decisions (The big slinger that went down the hill, and hitting driver on 17).
Audios out of sync having to turn off im afraid.  On another note Ian is coming across like a really "normal" guy and not the bad guy that media makes him out to be . Great to watch  But turning off until the videos audio is fixed 😢
That was awesome, Ian P, you are a legend!
Great video, new golf studio now paid off with the 200 ads i had to watch 🫣😂
Why aren't they using 3-woods off the tee?  Their drivers got them into so much trouble
Brilliant video! So much fun to watch.
Knew he was going to say Stenson at the end :) Please make it happen Rick! 🙏🏻🇸🇪 ❤️
Outstanding just amazing
That looked like a lot of fun .
Thoroughly enjoyable, thanks.
Ian Poulter comes across as a real smashing bloke
Time for a binge watch. This was my first -10 challenge. Great fun, I enjoyed it completely.
from the last few of these against tour pro’s it’s no secret Rick doesn’t play exceptionally on the front 9. It might seem counterintuitive, but starting level par might do him better. I think starting at 10 under is providing an unnecessary amount of pressure. Starting on a level playing field would keep him in the mindset that he can’t afford to lose any shots. Just my opinion. love every second of these! Keep up the good work!
just my video where audio is all out of sync??
Best video youve ever made which is saying something! Poults is a true legend of the game and a natural on camera!
This is the best one yet, poults what a legend
Had to turn off. Sound out of sync 😢
Gotta say, what a stunning Golf Course!  If I played this I'd probably have to bring 3 boxes of balls though 😂
Dayum! 😉
What a great match and video. Ian Poulter was a real gentleman, advising Rick.  His comments to camera were fantastic.  Of course he won, they don’t call him the “postman” for nothing. Really great to see a tour professional go through his thought processes.
Poulter is a genuine professional what a class act.
Ah, making the turn without a sausage roll Rick?  That could be a match costing mistake.
My favorite pro of all time, thanks for challenging Mr. Poulter.
56:43 audio and picture out of  sink
What's going on, the sound is well out of sync. Tried to re start it 4 times. So i have quit on this.
Great video way to many ads
Ian was very kind to Rick walking in his line the first hole. He comes off as a firey gent.
Loved it, absolutely loved it. Yes you both didnt play to your best abilities, but my God it was thrilling to watch. Listening to the insight and thought process of one of the greatest Ryder Cup players in history, was brilliant.  Best video yet!
I only watch without an account but this Video was mega, so entertaining from first minute to last, such a good video keep it up man 🍻
Pure gold,great video🙂
👏🏻👏🏻 absolutely loved this Ian was amazing to watch, and we’ll done Rick for taking it down the last 👌🏼
Best and most enjoyable match yet!!!!
Fun match. Ian gets my praise for not only being a great golfer, but a  helpful and friendly golf mate. (What we see of his game face on tour is so intense.) Instructive hearing him talk out the shots, as a high handicapper.  Aces guys!
Ian is super cool and is really good on camera. Total natural at YouTube!!!!!!
Absolutely brilliant
Poor quality can't continue watching it, it's so annoying.
Comments  from Ian were great.
Haven't gotten to the unsynced part yet, but watching you play a round with my absolute fav golfer of all time is probably the closest I'll ever come to getting on a course with him; it feels like I am there.   What the thorough gentleman the Postman is, someone I would give an arm and a leg to be paired with down at the local. Somehow, on the competitive stage (esp at Ryder Cups), he's got that fire in his eye, so I couldn't imagine him being such a chilled out dude to golf with.
Mr Poulter is just a youtube natural. A master class in screen presence!
It's amazing to here Ian take a whole matter of differentials in to consideration to narrow it down to a yard or two. I only have to take one differential in to consideration and that's how bad can I fuck this up! Meanwhile poulter is allowing for a pigeon farting as it flies by a 200 feet! Crazy😊
I love how Poults changed gears when he needed to. Simply brilliant video, probably my favourite of all time on YT. 👏👏
Brilliant match, unlucky Rick.  Ian is a legend and such a lovely guy
Best one of these yet. Ian poulter was great on camera
Your best video so far. Ians a legend.
Would love to see one vs the Irish, either Shane Lowry or Padraig Harrington 👌
What golf, with the inside tack of tour pro's and the amateur professional (sorry Rick) brilliant TV. Why watch endless repeats on sky rather than this????
You need a T-shirt that says "I beat the beard" and when you eventually beat a tour pro give them a t shirt saying the opposite and they have to wear it to the next tournament on the range for all the other guys to see ha ha
Great match. Enjoyed every minute of it. To be honest this format is closer to matchplay and Ian just showed he's one of the best match-play players of all time. Amazing job Rick and keep it up.
Absolutely brilliant this Rick, Woburn looks incredibly tight in parts. Ian was a great sport too.
Great to see how well you’re doing Rick. Followed you since I took up golf 3 years ago and it’s been a pleasure watching your videos. Ian is a class act and this video is further proof of that. Awesome video.
My goodness what a tight course. Trees overhanging most fairways. Insane. Imagine playing this every day. No thanks not with my accuracy
Rick always wonders why he alwsys starts bad. Its because he doesnt bother to do a proper warm up!
Man Rick has really packed on the lbs….
Best challenge in youtube golf no question
The audio went out of cink rick
One of my fave vids, Poulter is an absolute legend! One of my faves growing up. If you had played him in his prime you would of had it handed to you😂. Loved everything about this vid, more of the same please Rick add Guy aswell.
I know first hand, his beard stinks
The sound and video not matched
Have watched several hundred golf videos in the past year. I believe this might have been the most entertaining! Congrats on that ending!
Ian looks like he loves trash talking!  Epic video
Adverts are a joke.
Best video I think Rick has ever done, by far the best guest as well…. EVER.
Ian is like a mathematician,scientist,meteorologist and sportsman rolled into one, just shows the level of pro golfers 👍
Best one in the series so far, what a top bloke Ian is
Anyone getting issues at 44 minutes, says missing plugin on my screen and the sound is out
15th hole was the best. Even the best in the world have tough holes. Too bad EVERY one of my holes is like this 😂
I worked the Bob Hope Classic at PGA West like 20 years ago. I was working valet. Ian finished his round and asked me to drive him to his car.  We pulled up and he opened his trunk and had a cooler of beers.  He throws me one and said cheers.  I told him i was working.  He goes right now your not.  I couldn't pass it up.  What a legend
I don't think that Tensei Orange is the right fit for ya Rick - time to look at another profile.   Driver killed you on this course.
Great video, great chemistry as well!
Damn... it was really good till the audio sync got messed up 😔
Stenson @ nona would be epic🎉
Gutted the audio goes out of sync on 15th. Ruins the end of a great show
Iv got a delay on the sound after 45 mins so annoying
Best one yet
Epic video Rick and Ian, best one yet.  To take it to the final putt, its the Hollywood ending Brilliant. Really enjoyed it. Ian was amazing and once again the Postman delivered ❤
Great video!
I'm an Ian Poulter fan now?  Didn't have that on the bingo card.
Would love to see a video like this but in reverse Rick vs a higher handicap with the having a 10 shot lead
The best 10 under so far👏👏👏
This is what we’ve been waiting for!! 🐐🐐
*UPDATE IT’S FIXED* 😅😊  IMPORTANT!   For some reason after the 44 mins mark the audio is out of sync. Trying to sort it out ASAP!
Simply great entertainment... and informative. Thank you Rick and Ian.
Gotta love Poulter the way he talks through the game is fascinating, great video mind Rick and that course looked so hard very narrow well played ⛳️
This video is broken and still has > 1000 positive comments. This video just proves that these popular channels pay for views and comments. Most of the "people" who have commented on this video haven't really watched it. I'm sure most of the views are fake too. Reality bites.
Anyone else’s out of sync? Speaking’s like 20 seconds in front.
Love those videos, but 2 hrs is too long.
Poultry is excellent. Rick’s short game is poor for someone who is playing all the time
Genuinely, of all the pros you've played against Ian seems like the nicest. Truly a gentleman. He's given you tons of info about the holes, the greens, reads, shot advice, wind, etc. He's just relaxed and having fun. My favorite by far. And what a course! I loved the recovery shots from both of you. To me, that was great golf. Nobody hits every shot straight down the middle of the fairway. Ian's left-handed shot from behind the tree was epic!
Great Entertainment - maybe even because the golf was not that great all the time.
I really really enjoyed every minute of that! Love the banter & listening to Ian's shot analysis before hitting the ball. Great stuff! Thank you Rick for taking us along...... 👌
Poults is such a top bloke. Great video.
Does Poults sleep with that towel? It never left his side 😂 Fantastic video, I loved how Ian was articulating his train of thought which we all want to hear!
Great video save for the audio issues from 44:30 where it says 'missing plugin' and then goes out of sync.
One of my favourite videos yet, poulter is a legend, just a shame audio went out of sink for last few holes
Love these series against the pros
Really enjoying this video but at 44:30 it's says 'missing plugin' and then goes out of sync. Hopefully this can be fixed as want to watch the rest!
Ian’s face at 1:43:02  after you smash the tree 😂! What a video! 🙏
Best video ive seen in a long time, amazing!
Audio issues at 55:45 isnt synced
Great match, Loved it.
I don’t often comment on videos but really felt compelled to say what a legend of a bloke Poulter is.
Superb video.  Ian Poulter's talking before his and Rick's shots was truly enlightening.  His will to win shone through as well - in a genuinely steely but good way. Chapeau both.
ian with his towel😂🏌️‍♂️
Totally loved Ian!
I guess playing Ian Poulter one on one is quite daunting especially if you watch Ryder cup? 🤣🤣👍👍
Ok, so Ian immediately goes up to my top 5 favorite golfers from this video. What a combination of intensity and cheeky fun. He's a gem.
This video is AMAZING but am I the only one at 1 hour 15 with audio/video sync issues?
Really enjoyed that! Poulter was brilliant on camera with his narration. Entertainer too.
Great video, I really enjoyed it! What a pity the issue with the plugin, I hope it can be fixed.
Rick what a national treasure absolutely brilliant content, and what a fantastic insight into a tour pros mindset phenomenal 👏
What a great chap I.P. great to listen.
Rick vs brooks! The grudge match!
Great vid. Poults is a legend. I’ve played this course and whilst he’s a pro, to come back off hols, play a casual round and shoot level par round there is ridiculous
Ian poulter is a legend awesome gent . It's great to hear the thoughts going through his mind before each shot.
That was an amazing watch! Really enjoyed it. You almost had him Rick, great effort. What a great fella Ian is! Loved how involved he was in this match and how he guided you around his home track. Wonderful viewing. Best so far👌
Love the channel Rick but I think it’s about time you get some lessons because you play like a 20 handicapper! I thought I was watching tubes 😮
1:21:14 is absolutely hilarious. I was dying!
Keep doing these videos…Maybe Tiger someday!
Best one yet Rick!!
TIGHT course!
The sound wasn't synced right on this vid
Is it just me or is it completely out of sync after an error at 44:29
That first tee shot from Poulter was the cleanest tee shot I’ve seen on this channel. Absolutely mustard 👍
enjoyed the video but at about the 1/3 point, the sound and picture got out of sync... :(
You can clearly see why Ian is good in match play! He can say a lot with saying we're little.. Would both love and hate to play with him! 🙈❤️
Ian is the bomb!
Rick love your content but watching it on a tablet I can't hear a word you are saying . Up the volume please
Poult's is a true scholar and a gentleman. The podcast was great but this has made him my favourite golfer for sure now!  (56:21 you can hear a slight thud as the metal putter hits ricks shin 😂)
@44.29 a Missing Plugin notice decided to pop up and mess with the lip syncing (by about 10 seconds!!). Ruined the video for me. Anyone else get this?
Brilliant video, entertaining golf and very tense. Poults seems to be great fun to be around. Rick you seemed “star struck” and playing a challenging course really tests you.
I reckon that was the best 10 shot challenge so far. It’s amazing to see how the pros dig deep when it comes to the crunch. Rickie Fowler at Medalist on the 18th and now Poults here in the last couple of holes. Fantastic Rick 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Love Poulter.  Love this series.  Also with all the tour pros you have played  in this series. How down to earth they are.  From the outside  looking  in.  They really  enjoyed  it.
Is there something not right with sound... It's delayed
RICK, PLEASE FIX THE VIDEO AND RE-POST. This is one of the best videos ever, but it is out of sync and ruins it.
Great video , probably my favourite so far. Props to Ian he was quality all round
I just got to the second tee shot of Rick's, I have some advice for Rick. Take  2 weeks off from playing or practicing, then never play again and stick to podcasts.
I just can't watch rick around the greens, it hurts me so much
Please do more of these, brilliant
Best player you’ve had on these and the format is amazing! Wish we could get one of these once a month!!
Brilliant match- Poulter is a class act. Might be the best one yet 🏌‍♀⛳
Can you Make a Video about golfing with the Apple Watch Ultra?
that was absolutely class, love Ian👏 and what a game 💪+11 rick get down to the range pal 😂😂😂
Comes up with missing plug-in and then audio is delayed
How tight is Woburn!!!!! I would need to take 200 balls with me.
Rick, you should have mentioned the ball id you were using for the provisional balls?
Did anyone else have any audio buffering issues?
Love these 10 under par vids - this was the best! Epic till the end! shout out to editors and production for making it great too!
great video, but I'm the only one that had audio problems? Just before half way the audio seems to come before the image...It just me? I read the comments but nobody seems to wrote about that
If you didn’t knew who they were, you’d say they’re besties just playing golf! Amazing video as always, loved Ian on the channel!
Ian is hilarious, he should start his own show.
Ian Poulter is a national treasure. He should be Sir Ian
Great Video, straight off holiday the postman still turns it on when required! Legend!
Rick of all your matches against the pros this one is by far the best one. Cheers to Ian poulter and to you keep up the great videos brother and take care
Around 44:30 the video shows missing plug-in and goes way out of sync that the same for anyone else?
Great video but terrible lip sync issues
Absolutely brilliant..!! ❤ Poults is, and always will be up there for me, doesn’t matter which tour he plays on. 2 of the most decent gents you’d ever want to play golf with….that finish though 🔥 Awesome 🔥
I'm sorry but I can't watch it to the end. I really like Rick and all he's done but his golf is just not TV worthy. It's uncomfortable viewing. Great stuff from Poulter.
Best video, ever
Audio is 40 sec behind?
Absolutely f***ing ace!!!!!!
It’s been said, but hearing Ian’s thoughts and commentary is just amazing. Watched every minute…
The speech sync is out of at 47 mins?.
Cheers, Sir Ian
Anyone else have issues with the audio and video been out of sink from just after the 40th minute?
Everytime RS talks up a fade. Without exception he hits a draw! Every time. Ha ha
Ian was delightful.  Would love to see Henrick next.  Thanks Rick for the great content
Great video again top bloke and what a golf course 👌👌
What a great guy Ian Poulter is! Wish he was still playing on the PGA tour!
Audio seems to be out of sync?
Great video.... didn't notice until today how bad Poulters breathing is, either terrible asthma or heavy smoker :-(
does anyone else get a glitch at about 43mins that puts it out of sync?
got  a missing plugin error after 44:50 and audio was off by 8 seconds for the rest of the video, not watchable
Great video. Will watch it complete once sound get edited correct from the de sync @ 44mins ish
44:28 "missing plugin" Final Cut Pro.... do I get a prize for watching the whole vid rick?
Has anyone else have playback issues
Not sure what happened with this video but up popped a screen regarding a missed "plug in" and from then on the picture and sound became out of sync by 10 seconds or so which totally spoilt what should of been an incredible video!!
Another Rick Shiels video I leave within 10 minutes as the golf is just bad.
Ian shaking his head no as Rick is saying "I see nothing but the bottom of the cup" got me audibly laughing lol
Best video yet Rick. Ian Poulter is a gem.
Anybody else getting sync issues?
I love how Ian channels his inner Jim Halpert with all his looking into the camera.
Missing plugin after 43 mins (ish) ruined the video
Awesome all round 👏 if anyone was gonna hole that put on the last it was gonna be the postman ❤
What a match!!!
Is the video out of sync after 44:30 for anyone else?
Seeing how good rick is and how bad he scores is discouraging 😅
What happened at 45 mins?  The audio sync is 💩
What a video, thank you Rick! Poults is such a gent and legend!
what's with the "missing plugin" at 44:28 and then the subsequent audio video desync for the rest of the video? brutal
Anyone else sees missing plug in around 44 min? Slight editing error I’m thinking
Anyone else get 44 minutes in and the audio went out of sync with the video?
Whole thing is out of sync, ruined it
Amazing seeing so many sycophantic comments from people who obviously haven't actually watched the video all the way through. Audio sync goes at 44 minutes with some sort of plugin missing. Can you say bots?
Not sure if just me, did flip to other YouTube vids and they were all ok, but this was way out of sync on the audio and video from hole 7. Like watching a badly dubbed kung fu movie.
Poults going full caddie mode for Rick was something i wasnt expecting to see
Starting at 44:28 I get a screen saying "Missing Plugin" and then the video is out of sync with audio for the remainder of the video.  Anyone else experience this?  Loving this video but it makes it really hard to watch
yet chose liv knowing he might never be picked for Ryder cup ever again? thats loving your country
“Four doubles in this round, I’m just throwing these shots away annoyingly.” I feel this in my soul.
I seem to be having issues with the sound overlay after 1 hour 10 minutes
Rick is looking well chubby, too many half-way house sausage rolls buddy
Best one yet Rick 🙏 .. awesome ..
Audio and visual massively out of sync 😢
Rick that eagle put at hole 5 was shocking mate, ngl
YouTube has 20 freaking ads on the video and tends to slam them right before someone takes a shot. This platform is ridiculous.
Great video. Best one yet.
is there an audio synch problem?
Without doubt, the best vidoe i have watched. Ian Poulter is a star and what a cracking match !
Rick has to be the most insecure golfer on YouTube,just commit and if you get it wrong then f@ck it 👌
Cracking video!!
Do next break 75 at St. Andrews
Great vid
Audio/ video gets corrupted around the 44:28 mark for me. out of sync.
love this and ian such nice guy .shame the audio went out of sink .if poss please reload with audio in ink as the audio was ahead and told us what hapened b4 shot was made , went out of sink for hour in . shame was loving it soo  much was my fav till then couldnt really enjoy/watch it when went out . shame
Great video! The mic levels are f’d tho 😢
Very impressed with Poulter and the commentary. Absolute natural, great course and great match.
Only 37:00 into this video, and I will say this course is brutal if you are having ANY directional issues at all. Yikes.
This is awesome. Ian Poulter is so much fun to watch. Good stuff guys and thanks to both
Fantastic GUY!!!
Great video Rick, Ian was really good talking through the shots.
Audio is broken and completey out of sync no matter what I do to the video 😭
Out off all the English players Ian is by far my favourite English player
awh man I just wanna be mates with Ian. What a guy
Video went out of whack on 7th hole, it said missing plugin then talking was about 10 secs ahead of seeing shot…
Anybody else getting the missing plug in message after 44.28 which makes the sound and the image not sync up?
Ian's inner monologue is a dissertation on golf and physics.  My inner voice just says "try not to mess this up"
Is it just me or does the dubbing go out of sync at 46 mins for a bit?
Hahah what a legend Ian is. Same thing with Stenson would be lovely.
Sensational video, best yet by a country mile. Poults was always going to be superb but even he surpassed expectations. Hard to think how you’ll top this one Rick.
Anyone else's audio and video become completely desynced? like 5 seconds off?
One of my favorite videos of all time from you! Entertainment from start to finish! Great shots, funny shots, all the above! What a video!
I was watching fine, then the dubbing went way off, couldn't watch anymore as it was melting my tiny brain🫠🧠
Great game - was really fun to watch both. One day, Rick, one day... ;)
Great watch! Ians a legend duno how you couldn't like the man, ultra competitor! watch 2 hours of this of a movie very day of the week!
Absolute world class content this
By FAR the best Rick vs tour pro so far. Ian is brilliant and so generous with his advice. Also, hilarious banter between you! Bravo!
I absolutely  love watching Rick and the content  he's been dishing out. But the amount of ads on this video completely  took me out of the video I was getting upset near the end and was about  to stop watching
Ian rocking a Ping big dog…
Best video and content thus far on the channel. Absolutely incredible insight and awesome personality from Ian. So chilled and you can tell he WANTS to be there. Happy for Rick to take his time, give commentary etc.
Rick......I love ya man, I love the pod, I love the content, but your game.....I hope this review studio really does get some use because you still need to be decent at golf if we are to take your tips and advise seriously. Finch is turning into a stud golfer so you can tell who is really putting time into there game, get fired up to get decent again!
Too bad it says "missing plug-in" 44.30 into the video and after that the sound and video are not in sync. Kind of annoying.  But great content and Ian is just great at explaining how he's thinking, every shot! 👍🏽
I love you Rick but what is going on with the American “Damn”?!?!
Was I the only one that had a plug in error on the 7th hole for Rick's 3rd shot
I have to say the Netflix show Full Swing did Ian Poulter a bit dirty. Came across as a prick to me, but this video changed my opinion of him.
That was such a good watch Rick, FairPlay to Ian, it was nice to hear his thorough break down of each shot, and that course looks mint. Cheers
Anyone else having issues with the audio not in sync with the video starting halfway through. Around 44 minute mark.   random screen flashed and said plugin missing.
What an unbelievable series !
Is it just me or is the audio out of sync for like half the video?
The attention to detail when assessing shots really shines through with these tour pros. Sets them apart.
Audio messed up 44 mins 15 to 20 second delay.
Could watch this duo all day! Ian is a blast!!!! Good work gents!
I love these videos!!! Ian is an awesome person to play with, it looks. He helped, loved how he explained everything. It was awesome to be in his head like you've done. What a great personality. The course looked amazing! Great job, everyone, and thanks, Rick, for the great entertainment!
Both of these guys at one time had a feux-hawk.
Is it just me or does the audio get desynced at 44:29 when the missing plugin screen pops up?
I think your handicap would be 14
Your editor trolling me with that "Missing Plugin" at 44:28. Thought my browser had crashed
Not often you watch a two hour YouTube video - but that was a Barry banger !
What drama right to the last. However, when Ian said it’s a 20 to one shot Rick, I think you should have listened to him. Ian was great value, loved his comments to camera. Great series but surely you’re due a win!
Loved this. A 2h modern day classic. Some terrible and great shots. Golf.
I think Rick needs to listen to  the old saying don't get your ideas and your capabilities  muddled up 😂
Did Ian switch his putter half way?
Best tour pro match ever. Having been to several tournaments here in the US, Mr. Poulter has always been one of the more personable players towards fans in the heat of it. And his social media is great. Looks like Rick and Mr. Poulter really enjoyed their time on the course and off (if you watched the podcast). I agree this should be yearly for these two
That was the best 10 shot challenge so far, very entertaining, Poults is a top guy and a top golfer, it's great to hear what goes through his mind  on every shot. That last from Rick was so close to going in.
Great video! Ian showing his class with loads of banter and some great golf. I just hope some of the things he said and did get turned into memes for the channel 😂
This series 🔥 all timer this video great entertainment thanks Rick & Ian 👏
Shoutout to Mr. Poulter! The man was GREAT!! Rick this was such a good video!!! Props to you and your team!!🏌🏻
Truly loved this video. Too bad for the first 2 holes!! Ian what a character!!!
Playing off the path and taking practice shots first. Superb shot but I couldn’t help but wince every time that vokey hit the stones 😳
Missing plug-in hah 44:11
Really? The Liv w*nker?
44:29 says missing plugin and sounds goes out of sync, anyone else getting this?
Relax on the adverts - too many
Best video yet, you forget just how good these guys are under pressure. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I think Ian has found his calling maybe once his tour career comes to an end.
Lots of things about Rick are impressive. His game is not one of them.
Outfreakingstanding!!!!!😂
audio gets all out of wack at like 45 mins
Audio desync after 45 minutes?
Poults is one of the Goats - Also incredible to see him compute all of the numbers and variables - Top Blokes
Rick, I’ve watched you for ages but never made a comment, but this video was the best ever. I loved Ian and how he helped you round the course…I wish I had him when I played. I look forward to Fridays to watch your content. I would rather spend 2 hrs. watching you than a blockbuster Marvel movie. Keep it up and looking forward to your  H.I.T Golf channel content. 👍
Brilliant ! just bloody brilliant 👍🏼
Love the commentary from Ian, but loved his facial expressions even better, great video!
Reddit was trying to determine if Ian has a pierced nipple. Did y’all notice anything while y’all were out there?
Quality content.
it seems to me that the claw grip doesn't work for long distance putts?
That was absolutely epic, Poulter was superb and great chemistry with Rick. His thought process brought such great insights. My fave 10 shot challenge so far and the course was savage as anything off line was a nightmare. 🔥🔥🔥
Poults probably knew the first one would be fine and just trolled him by making him hit 2 more hahaha
One of my favourite videos so far! Your like a comedy double act! Great chemistry! Another game is needed to see if you can beat Ian on a course that isn't is home one!
Saw IP last week in person at the LIV event, true class
Ian’s looks at the camera are very Jim from The Office “American version”
How can you not like Poults. One of the best so far, not all about perfect golf.
Ooooft. Can see why he joined LIV, absolutely past it from what I can see after 6 holes.
Just one word: EPIC👍
What a great display of sportsmanship and just generally being a top bloke from Poulter. Rick once you’re relaxed you play better lol. A great video thank you.
The way Rick says damn get me every time. Daam
Best video by Rick EVER! Ian is a legend, so humble and has a great personality. Love his sense of humour! Good luck to both of them.
anybody elses sound timing delay around 44:44
Makes me feel a lot better about my golf game
Best one yet, Rick!  Ian is a class act.
What a video! Loved it, Ian flicked the switch and made you dig deep!
These 10 shot challenges are my favorite content on the channel. They never disappoint. Ian was a good sport and a lot of fun.
Sound was in sync , stopped and came back to finish watching last 3 holes and now its out.
Best video ever!
Love I.P.
Best yet. Loved it! ❤
Poulter seems like a real laugh
I really enjoyed watching this one . Great to hear him talk through his own shots, as well as advise what he’d do on your shots. Can’t wait for the next vid and golfing partner
Love this  Love Poulter what a great character and the game needs him.
Anyone else get the problem with audio and video syncing after 44:30?
Loved the video, Ian is one of my favourite players.
Shout out to Ian's towel. Solid work
They call him the postman because he always delivers. Absolutely brilliant content lads- thanks so much. And brilliant camera work and editing. Just superb
Anyone elses sound ahead of the video from around the 42minute mark??
We knew poulter would be good value. Good course. Great video.
2 hours of this is better than mooching through Netflix for something I’ve seen before
Loved this video what a great bloke
Love these style videos. Good work
Brilliant video, I've always liked Ian.
This video was epic Rick.  Great job as always and just the most entertaining series around.
Ricky, you're all bag, mate!
Just amazing to watch. Looked like you had so much fun out there both of you. Keep the great content coming
What a great game loved it 👏
Beautiful course!
Love your show.   But.   I have decided not to listen to any show you do that showcases a LIV golfer or LIV in general.   I think the Saudis are a terrible regime and that every Gay friend I have would not be grateful for any attempt to legitimize it.   Which is the affect of you associating with it in this way.
So many great things about this video.  I really like how much Ian talked about his own shots and his decision making process.  And how much he assisted Rick with his.  And talk about a narrow course off the tee, good grief!
When I.P stops playing and starts his You Tube channel….. watch out Rick! Absolute quality content
brilliant, down to the wire
Hey Rick please try and challenge the legend Padraig Harrington
Sadly was really enjoying it when plugin not working appeared and after all audio is out 😢😢
I religiously watch your videos but very rarely leave a like or comment but this has been fantastic viewing. Great entertainment and the wayward golf made for even better moments. Great editing as always. Perfect start to a weekend for any clubhouse member
Freaking fabulous! Better than Coranation farmenders!
44:30 missing plugin?
Love Ian...not followed him much...but will going forward.  Seems very genuine ...seems like a fun guy.  One of my favorite vids...Thanks Rick and Ian!
Rick, the shot you hit on 13 was so dumb
Wtf happened with the audio?
That was Magestic...😅😅😅
I think Poulter got a bit of a reputation for speaking his mind early in his career, perhaps rightly so. But he was so charming and playful and an overall great playing partner. Well done!
Amazing 👏
GREAT VIDEO GREAT GOLF COURSE. IAN WAS AMAZING
Top notch video
"like and subscribe, and just deal with it" - fantastic Episode.
just saying on 44:31 comes up with missing plugin i assume a plugin to do with the reply
Rick has a big bunda
Best one yet!!! Ian is brilliant and when he gets sick of touring has a future on YouTube if he wants it. Great fun to watch.
I wish my game-attitude were more like Ian's. 100% golf intensity, but still able to have a laugh.
This was the best one I've watched. Well done guys, and only a few ads so it was enjoyable 😊
next up  : Can i beat Tiger if i start 20 under par? Augusta special episode
Audio is out of sync about half way through? Ian was a great guest and host.
My favourite video ever. Ian is a legend and great in front of the camera. Perfect for YouTube and a good laugh.
Wow.  Mr. Poulter is a sweetheart of a man -- I'm stunned.  He was going out of his way to help Rick, and his willingness to give details on his swing thoughts and strategies was truly excellent.  And Ian Poulter -- world famous, Ryder Cup wizard, won millions on tour -- picked up Rick's divot on 18 -- just stunning.  What a gentleman.
This is the best of the 10 shot series… Hearing the thought process of a Tour Pro like Ian Poulter is so amazing. Excellent content! Please play Henrik Stenaon next…
Classic chuckle on 17
IAN, what a character. You can see how he got his Ryder cup hat on for the last 3 how's. Both of you....Chemistry, joy, fun, competition, just like two golf buddies. Absolutely fantastic. video. Truly best golf video and most fun I had ever. 👏👏👏
What a treat! Excellent episode!!
Micah Morris is next too 😊
Missing plugin hive!
Ian is such a great, genuine guy. I think we sometimes forget that these tour pros are just regular human beings, too. YouTube has shown us how down to earth that most of these guys really are. I feel like I have actually gotten to know several of them through their exposure on social media. It’s very refreshing, and so fun to watch, and enjoy.  This is the pinnacle of the YouTube golf content world.  Anyone that isn’t consuming this stuff, is truly missing out. Thanks Rick, and so many others….
Henrik Stenson is next
even when rick hits a great shot he says i’m gonna hit a little fade and hits a draw
Brilliant brilliant brilliant
Great vlog.Ian’s a great bloke. Need him as Ryder cup captain, he’s the man for the job when he’s ready.
Best one yet! Great battle on the last. It was like watching a Ryder cup match play.
I'm sure the guys at Rick Shiels HQ will be already aware but the audio is severely out on this video.  Not if its for all but i am seeing lots of comments on it. Strange 🤷‍♂️
audio out of sync?
The best one so far, really cool to hear the detailed thought process. Loved it!
Phenomenal. Full respect to Ian, his respect for you grew and grew as it went on I’m sure. He’s picking up your divots, Ian Poulter!!! Legendary and a gentleman
seeing the pride Ian Poulter has for Woburn, and the way he fetched his and Ricks divots and replaced them throughout was fantastic, so many pro's wouldn't do that. plus the looks he gave at ricks shot ideas made this the best "start 10 under" yet
Poults is the typical British Hero great example to the kids.Ryder cup memories he has brought me many .
Sound went out of sync for me at about an hour in, was hearing reactions to shots before they hit them 🤷 dunno if anyone else had same issue of it was just my internet having a glitch 🤷
Great video, always loved poults. Hearing his thought process for every shot is amazing. Also helped you out which we haven’t really seen from previous 10 shot challenges!
Just throwing it out there, nearly 2 hours is too long for a golf video. Shorten it or split it in two, I tend to jump to just the actual shots to make it manageable
class.
Amazing video, absolute class from both you and Poults
Great video Rick. Has to be one of the best. IJP didn't disappoint, down to earth and clearly loves his golf. It's a tough and tight course so I thought you aquitted yourself well after a nervy start.
Completely enthralled, loved the banter , best you tube battle I’ve watched 🎉
Rick mate, you’re needing to spend less time at the halfway huts working your way through the sausage rolls….your butt and belly are growing at quite a pace buddy! Great match, Poults shows some v useful course management skills!
Even with a cart, Ian is having to walk a lot more than he usually does 😂.
Definitely the best video to date. Great pairing, good commentary and great atmosphere between the two of them. Even in the heat of it Poulter is geeing him on. He certainly turned it on in the final few holes!
Ian was so so good for this. Really showed his thought process. And then gave you as much guidance as possible……….and then gave you plenty of banter too! Arguably one of your best videos so far!
Missing plugin? 44:32
Rick as usual, even on the first tee box, he's full of negative affirmations its incredible, he even builds up every chip, every putt, its depressing to watch.I've watched his channel for years and he's the most negative player on youtube. Only good for the guests that he plays against
Ian has just upgraded to legend. Was awesome to hear there detail of his thinking.  He then turned on the concentration to finish the match. Awesome.   He sold himself short. I think he excels in short game but more so in mental game 👍
What a stellar piece of YouTube gold. I was always indifferent to Poulter, just because I wasn't watching much golf when he was at his zenith, but what can I say, now I'm a fan. Yeah, this is the best video you've put on the channel, and I've seen everything you've posted since you grew a beard, I'm even in The Clubhouse. I'm just down the road Rick if you fancy a fan related game, haha.
These 10 under videos are the best golf content on YouTube for me, Poulter was great value...
I swear to god that if Ian had looked for a reach around Rick would have said no bother . Favourite vid yet
THE AUDIO is bad bad, audio not sync'd up right. 1:37:00 example *Edit it is better :D now
This was by far my favorite video in this series.  Ian was great in front of the camera!
Played the Duchess at Woburn, nightmare if you’re not straight, I’m a high handicapper (17) can usually drive well, but those courses are a complete nightmare for nervy driving.
Can you try and get some more adverts on,especially in the middle of shots!🙈
Ian what a top guy
Loved everything about this video Rick. What a bloke Poulter is by the way
The audio and video at 44:28 becomes severely desynced until the end of the video. Good video but everything is weird.  Edit: Fixed as of 11:30pm EST.
Great video!
First 2 holes and I questioning should I keep using Rick golf tip videos
This was very watchable
I find it impossible to warm to Poults on a personal level, but enjoyed the video.
Ian is an absolute legend, he is a natural on the camera. Will definitely have majestics as my team, thank you Rick ⛳⛳⛳
My favorite video for a very long time. So much quality, Ian seems like a great guy! Great work, Rick and the team!
Rick really coining it in on the video so many forced watch ads!
what a match and ian poulter is a class act!
Brilliant video, that was so enjoyable on a rainy Friday evening. Nice one Rick 🎉
1:43:14 might just be my favourite shot I've ever seen on this channel, I'm on the floor
Ian is now in my top three people i want to go on the piss with before i die 🍺
33:07 Is that Guy on the left?
That was incredible. 👏👏 fantastic watch
Brilliant 🏌️‍♂️
Great video, that was a captivating match!
What a great match.  Ian made it fun and not so serious.
Honest golf !!? Great vid !!
is the audio desync me or the video or YouTube? anyone else getting it? I hear the audio then the video catches up
Really enjoyed this, thanks Rick. Always liked Ian but I got so much out of hearing him talk through his thought process. Legend. Great vid
What the hell, at 44:28 to 44:33 it shows "Missing Plugin" instead of the golf and then the video/audio is out of sync for the rest of the video. Unwatchable after that.
"Can I call you Poults now?" - Classic.
What an amazing video IAN POULTER LEGEND thank you RICK SHIELDS
What a video. I have to say I haven’t always been a huge fan of Poults for a number of reasons. However he was epic in this video, arguably not playing his best but incredibly humble and a joy to watch him and his thought processes. I’ll definitely be following his results with greater interest from now on. Top lad.
This was easily the most entertaining match-up to watch!  Ian never disappoints...in play or entertainment value.  Loved it.
Thank you Rick i very much enjoyed that one, I have always been a fan of Ian Poulter and like him even more now, only thing missing was real would banter lol   well done both of you.
What a video guys! Ian was so engaging and so helpful to Rick. My respect for both of you was sky high, now it’s even higher! Brilliant content 👏👏👏
Any normal golfer would of bailed out and walked home after the first 2 holes. To keep your head in the game especially playing Ian was amazing. Can only imagine the nervs you had. Let's face it, your playing with a ryder cup knockout champion 🏆 who hasn't lost a single game in the ryder cup. Impressive rick. Ian seems a top bloke
Oh yes, challenge the Iceman and prep yourself for a roast by the dry humor of his 😂😂
Rick should watch Ian's putting stroke. Its great how he keeps his putter low to the ground on the take away. Rick tends to bring his putter head on too high an arc creating less consistent and more spin on contact.
One off the best vids you have done Rick Ian is a legend aswell loved every minute off that
Ian Poulter - what a guy! Loved this edition and also got Ian's "Dumb and Dumber" reference. Thanks for a brilliant video.
Again lol JUST HIT IT STRAIGHT. STOP TRYING TO DRAW AND FADE IT YOUR NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
Loved that, Poults is a legend, great video Rick
Was Rick in a different climate to Ian! Look at their clothes!!
Great content
Is no one else getting the audio issues about 1/3rd of the way through the video?
Brilliant , watched start to finish , thoroughly enjoyed Ian’s insight in course management and comes across as a good guy 👍👍
Best video ever! Just phenomenal in every way
Poulters face when he is cleaning his club after his second shot on the 18th. He wants to win and is loving it.
Dude!!! Ian fucking Poulter!  My favorite golfer ever.
Wow. Best video yet. Ian is such a great guy and the banter was awesome. Thanks Rick
I always wonder why you try and fade it or draw it or slide it off the tee rather than just hitting straight. Seems over complicated for little benefit
My favourite bit was the Missing Plugin @44:29 😁
If Rick says ‘Dayum’ one more time I’m going to hurt myself
Just the best video with 2 of my favourite golfers!!
This video was amazing. Ian seems like such a laugh as well
What an absolute pleasure to watch! Thanks Rick, thoroughly enjoyed the whole lot. And Ian poulter, what an absolute legend and gent he is.
Have watched the first hole and the second hole tee off 🙈🙈🙈
Great video! My favourite "10 Under". Ian was fun, and when he turned it on it seemed he was destined to come through.
Tell you what Rick, your hitting the nail on the head with the content. This has been one of my fav videos to watch, Ian is a true legend
Ian's commentary was brilliant, sharing his knowledge with us all and I'm sure we all have learnt a lot from him. Top bloke.
❤ That was a stellar round of golf from both of  you. What a nice guy Ian Poulter, what a nice person and a great Sport. I'm Majestics from here on.😊
Great video!!
Best -10 yet Rich absolutely brilliant listening to Ian's thought process on every shot what a player he has and still is.  Learned alot from this and will be thinking more on my shots before hitting it. Keep up the great work Rick can't wait to see who you have next but Ian will take some beating.
Is it just me is the last half of the video way out of sync
38:18  club face WIDE open at takeaway
Legend 😊
Enjoy the vids but couldn't watch this one if you paid me.
What a brilliant video, best one yet Rick. Ian was a great guest. Well done
Fantastic video -  amazing to watch the shot planning process  from Ian. Gives such an insight into the Tour pro standards. Great entertainment !!!!
Rick your videos are good but my God you need to get better at golf
I lost a little bit of love for Mr Poulter with the back and forth about LIV etc. But this video has made me completely adore him again. What a top bloke he really is. Just comes across as one of the nicest pros. I also was saying to my wife he looks like a wonderful father figure as well from other content.  Best video Rick has every made.   Nice one.
When you come out of an operation for a hernia and wake up to this great video! Great content as always Rick
This would be my nightmare course.
Best of these challenges yet! Great content!
That was amazing.  It was great to see such shot shaping and hearing the thought process.
Brilliant episode. Bring on more tour pros 👍👍 Can't wait for the next episode
great fun!
The time Ian Poulter has for you, and his openness about his thought processes is just phenomenal. What an absolute gentleman. Best guest ever.
Rick's a great narrator, great picture maker, great conversationality....shit golfer...😁
Thanks for the great content, Rick. I wish he wasn't wearing his LIV Golf gear.
Wow that 18th hole was brutal
The par 4s were challenging and the course played difficult especially with the roll outs on the fairways. Rick, you played great after being so nervous early on 😂. I’m not much a Poulter fan but he was a class act and provided tremendous insights. One of the best content videos I’ve watched.
Rick, I love this content. I am pulling for you to break through and get your first win. It was amazing to see Ian get in that "refuse to lose" zone. Great video
Outstanding best one yet...... 🔥🔥
Rick at 15 "I'm just gonna bomb it. Shut my eyes & hit in hard" lol now that's what I'd think every shot...if I played golf lol. I don't but I love this content 😊👌
This video and the match vs Lee are my 2 favourite golf videos on youtube
I've watched several of Rick's videos and the consistent mistake is a hook. And the more anxious or rushed Rick get, the more it hooks. I'm at a loss to understand why Rick either doesn't make a grip change or an address change. His tempo and alignment seem real solid but I think he needs to gear back a bit to allow his hands to catch up to his club face. Or open the face a tad at address.
44:28 was the best bit
You can’t be a scratch golfer anymore, surely! Your handicap must be about 8 to 10. I’d love to see you do a handicap series where we watch you card scores and see where you end up in terms of a handicap. 3 balls off the first tee 😭 back to back double bogeys. Unsure if you hit 2 fairways in reg and not sure you hit many greens in reg either. Would love to see your real handicap.   Ian Poulter was good value.
I rarely comment but I have to say that this one was superb! Ian has natural charisma that made the almost 2 hours go by so quickly. Great video Rick!
Great video but audio seems off - ahead of the video or something - & there was a missing plugin message half way through
By far the most enjoyable  10 under I have  watched.  Thank Rick and Ian❤
Has anyone ever seen Ian Poulter and Lee Mack in the same room?
Not much makes you feel proud to be British these days but Mr P certainly does. He's in my dream 4 ball all day long.
This was an unbelievable video really enjoyed it
The way Ian interacts with the camera kind of pulls 'us' the viewer into the video is second to nun. He just seems like an amazing guy. Best upload from you in ages... Great work Rick. Keep it up 🙂
Not gonna lie, went off poults when he went over to LIV golf and stopped following him on socials.  Apologies to poults, you are a legend and i forgot how much of a top bloke and brilliant golfer you are.  Cracking video one of my favourites.
Most relatable round of golf I’ve seen you play, Rick. Golfing in Ohio-USA, I sure have perfected the shots from the trees.
Greatest start to this series ever! I just cleared 5 minutes of watching and I'm rolling!!!
The more one gets to “know” Ian Poulter, the more one likes him. He just seems like a really good guy. Great video.
One of the best videos you've done. Easily the best 10 under video.
Best video so far. What a guy Ian is. He gave more advice and help to Rick than any of the other pros. Seriously, what a geezer!!
Ian's analysis just demonstrates what it takes to be competitive at the top level. Just a true golfing brain 🤯
Fantastic video. Ian has always been a great player that has great personality on camera. Hes like an everyman.
What a top, top video! Best one yet. So lucky playing an absolute Ryder cup legend. Real treat that was to watch cheers Rick.  Ian Poulter a class act. Brilliant.
Loved this! Ian Poulter the Legend. Great content Rick.
Enjoyed this game. Great to hear Ian working out yardage and shots needed. Postman delivers
Fantastic Rick, what a great chap Ian is and so interesting listen to him talking through his shots. I think once you relax in the pros bring the best out of you. Great video mate
Next should be Viktor Hovland
41:29 Rick embracing the East17 look
I flippin love Ian poulter!
the round was so enjoyable to watch and TOP NOTCH production value for this one - especially loved the camera angels with the 70-200. Only way to top it would be to get that MKBHD colab with a RED and high speed cameras ;)
What was the stroke index of the first two holes?
This was so great! Rick full rounds are probably my favorite way to watch golf. Sundays on tour are cool and all....but this is golf!
Rick you need to slow down your tempo .
Rick and Ian this has been the best watch your a star Ian love LIV
Best video yet this Rick! Ian poulter what an absolute legend! Came off a real genuinely nice guy!
Way way too many ads . 2 add after every hole .
Great video!… how about doing it where you give a golfer a 10shot start?.. Ill volunteer!! Haha
hearing Poulter walk through the process was great to hear, very insightful.
Rick, you’re a legend!…. but going back to the first hole, why do you try intricate chip shots from tight lies? No offense but you’re shit at it and keep doing it. You seem to throw a lot of shots away doing this. Why not get a hybrid chipper? Or just play a bump and run with a more forgiving club?
I am definitely an Ian Poulter fan now....👏👏👏
Stenson for your swedish fans 🇸🇪
Ian Poulter what a legend great video
Ian Poulter take a bow. Outstanding golfer and from this an outstanding individual as well. Encouraging without being patronising and just so knowledgeable
I was lucky enough to play this course with a member for my birthday (off the yellows). Nice to see how Rick and Poulter play it compared to how I did. On the first hole, I ended up almost exactly where Rick did, except I hit 2 trees while trying to stab the ball out.
Rick - where were you aiming off 10th tee!?
Totally and utterly awesome.  What a genuine lovely fella Poulter is.
Name 2 more synonymous words, Rick and meltdown. I’ll wait
Ian is a legend 😃😎 what a nice guy 🥳
Awesomely entertaining. 2 hours flew by. Well done both of you, and as always the Postman delivers 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Was this filmed after the class for chipping? There's no way after all that you still putt like chip that.
Great video, quality is getting unreal. Poulter laughing at Ricks attempt out the trees on the 17th 😂😂😂😂. Keep up the great content.
Every time Ricks on a par 5 that finger makes an appearance, wish it never got brought up 🤣
IP was brilliant to be fair. I wasn’t the hugest of fans but now I am. Great video once again.
I don’t get how ricks played golf for a crazy amount of years but plays a 1st hole like that. Tracers all over the place!
Agree that this is one of the greatest videos from Rick, or any other youtube golfer for that matter. Ian's commentary is such a rich addition and the amazing insight it gives into the mental process of one of the greatest golfers of our time is invaluable. Kudos to all! I am at loss for words to describe how much I learned from this video.
I haven’t finished watching but had to break off it to type something. Just incredible! Rick you showed great character after the first 2! Can’t imagine the pressure playing with an icon like Ian. The best part, I LOVE it when you play a proper shot and he appreciates it and you can see the buzz you get when he tells you. So deserved! This is again, why you are THE golf channel
Rarely have I been more anxious to know what happens next in a golf match. Ryder Cup and WGC Match Play included. The 17th hole alone provided enough content for a video. Stupidly exciting stuff, loved it!
Rick, I wonder would a Guinness before you tee off before your next vs a tour pro match help with the nerves?
It’s hilarious you would think Rick would be more consistent, but it always reminds us GOLF IS HARD!
Absolutely class act in Ian Poulter! Love this video ❤ Great work coach!!
I hope Ian gets his chance to be Ryder Cup captain because he seems like such a decent bloke.
was anyone having the suspense music on that eagle putt, unlucky Rick - double decent recovery 😂
Ahahahaha on the edge of the bunker with that 3 wood worldy!!!!! Unbelievable
Rick, This was such an amazing video to watch! Thanks for the great content!
These videos are biblical.
That was incredibly entertaining and how can you not like Ian after seeing this.
By far the best RS video ever recorded. Ian is a class act.
Outstanding video, great fun.
Love this, hearing Poulter take you through all of the course and each shot thought is fantastic
"i think this ball is a bit battered and bruised" no worries, there's a few pristine ones scattered around.. been hit once :)
Why did you invite this jerk?
Missed opportunity to not wear a flashy set of trousers.
Wow quality video! Best video of you so far, best on YT! And tbh: So much better than with your assistant... This is RS Golf and why your channel is the top, need more of that.  And Ian: I was told that you are not that nice, absolutely don't know why! I have some of your nice trousers in my wardrobe, I am going to wear them defenetly more often and proud now! Such a nice funny guy out of all the other tour pros! Def. a fan now!
How do I introduce the technique used between 44:28 and 44:33 into my game? I've not seen that one before.
Bloody amazing video Rick. Poults is a legend. Keep it up
What a great guy Ian is…. Class.
Rick you need help with your game...
That was brilliant 👏 👏👏
Ian is such a nice, down to earth, gentlemanly fellow. Very enjoyable video
The amount of adverts is a fucking piss take
Best so far.  Such a great insight into the challenges of the course. Well done both of you.
Can see why he’s big part of Ryder cup team  Super bloke 👍
What a really nice guy. That about sums it up.
That has got to be !!!! To date the best video Rick has ever put out ! so entertaining!!! The 18th my goodness !!!!!! Brilliant
Ian being Mutley
Does anyone else find the way Rick says "Damn" hilarious. He has his English accent then says Damn like he's faking an American Accent. HAHAHA
Thanks  Rick for this fantastic content.  What a cracking bloke Poults  ( as his friends seem to call him 🙂) was as an opponent,sheer class.  I was like a nervous father waiting on the birth of his first child when you where on that final green.  One of your  best videos by far, and you have had some epics over the years. Thanks again for making golf so entertaining. https://www.youtube.com/s/gaming/emoji/7ff574f2/emoji_u1f642.png
Honestly I'm blown away. I feel like I didn't care to much for Ian for whatever reason. However, between the pod and this he may be my favorite guest you have ever had on. I'm a fan.
Loved the way I an switched on half way through. Great video rick as always and getting better and better :)
What an amazing video! Poults is such a legend, but what a role model too! Unbiased help for rick all the way round, reads caddy advice, raking bunkers fixing divots and pitch marks everywhere.  Just shows what a class act he is! Would love to see luke josh and rick take ian on 3v1. That would be superb!
Rick, honestly i throughly enjoy this & yes IF you get stenson this would be a match
Epic. Chapeau to Ian. So good to watch. Just when you think you have him that class comes into play.
honestly the content keeps getting better and better. This is awesome, Ian is such a generous guest. Fascinating listening to him read the shots and work it out. Kudos to you and your team Rick.
This bloke never fails to deliver the best content, not only he is such a likeable fella, but he has the best guests. Ian poulter is without a doubt my favourite so far, English Lion through and through, by far my favourite golfer. Great video, thank you both.
Great vid, loved how much he talked through everything, he was quality
Very fun match to watch!
The added drone views adds this a class above the rest ...amazing and thanks from us all
Ian’s voice/accent sounds like Rod Stewart. Are they from the same area? Rick sounds more like a northerner I think. Kinda Beatles-ish.
IP is a great sport looks like you bought  enjoyed the round. Happy belated birthday Rick
As an American and huge Ryder Cup fan, Ian has pissed me off more times than I can count. So much so that I've just come to love the guy. Sort of an, if you can't beat him, join him scenario. Love his competitiveness and fire and thankful that we got to see him in this light. Great job Shielsy having him on and an edge-of-your-seat match at the end.
Forget the score - the 17th and 18th say everything about the difference between a PGA pro and a Tour pro. All between the ears.
What an epic match. Just realised on the 17th that this is the course you had the “Be the number” golf bidder challenge with Pete!
an absolute class act as always Poults <3
Been waiting for this!! ❤
Great video.  Absolutely great to see an Ian that many people dont see as he is in full tourny mode.  Great advise, great hole descrips, and great banter thru the round.  Would like to see more Ian if possible.
Ian using a ping driver?????
This was so fun to watch haha great back and forth and good vibes the whole time
Never been a big fan of Ian,but he came across as a really sound fella. Rick mentioned he gets nervous playing with tour pros,well that’s how most of us feel every time we play with regular pros.
brilliant ... love ian poulters golf and now hearing his thoughts for the shot is even better
Great hacks
Ian hit's ball into narnia....  Ian: I think I might be ok
For years i was NOT a Poulter fan, then watching him work his way back into the majors and the podcast and this video has changed my mind. Thanks to him for doing the videos and Rick as always you did a GREAT job on these videos.
Right, this is it. We have achieved the pinnacle of YouTube videos. Might as well delete the app now.
I think it's your best vid. Friend of mine has been fortunate to play with Ian and says he is the most down to earth guy you can meet and it certainly looks that way in this video.
What an absolute fantastic video. Any chance of a rematch 🏌🏼
Trying to explain to my wife why I'm laughing out loud at a golf video!!!! Great game.
That was so much fun to watch! Poults was brilliant on camera and what a show! Awesome!
Ian did not have a good day but it’s awesome that he seems fun to be around even when he’s losing because you know he’s competitive.
Easily the best video on this series and may be the best on YouTube ever!  As an American, it has been easy to not like Ian.  I certainly recognized his talent and how fierce a competitor he is but did not like him.  After this and the podcast, I can say that has changed.  He was so funny, especially all the side glances and gestures to the camera. He is now one of my favorites, and I will be rooting for him wherever he competes.  If he ever decides to make a YouTube channel it would be awesome.
What a great video. It was so nice to see and hear all of what goes into a pro's swing and their thinking ahead of time. I loved every bit of this. Thanks for the great content Rick! And thanks to Ian for being an awesome guest!
Tthe amount of golf lingo pair with the english lingo makes it impossible to understand lol
Brilliant
Rick needs to focus on his game instead of content!
Amazing , thanks to Rick but especially Ian...think l might watch all over again 😂
Just watched the podcast and as a 15 year old golfer that just quit tennis to peruse golf a set of clubs could help tremendously
I’m two holes in and I swear I have never seen anyone look so petrified as Rick. Just relax Rick, Poulter can’t even make top 30 on LIV
Always been one of my favorite golfers. What a guy poults is.
I think the fame from the channel has gone to ricks head, probably one of the worst golfers on YouTube atm. It wont be long until we're seeing break 90 as the new series.
Great video 👍👌If Rick fancies playing a round playing like that would definitely be up for it👍 Always wanted to play Woburn . Such great golf courses ⛳️👍
What an awesome vlog. I was completely hooked! So entertaining and Ian’s looks to camera were priceless. Loved it from start to finish!!!
Thank Rick. Absolutely phenomenal treat and Poulter is worldclass on telly as well!
Love this content
Best Guest.  My ignorant opinion of Ian has changed.  Well done!!
Sometimes you are difficult to watch bro. But yeah, good stuff.
This is by far the best 10 shot challenge yet. Ian came across as a really top bloke. I'd love to have 18 holes and few beers with him
Hearing Ian talk through shot choice was invaluable.
Wow what a great vlog Poult's was great possibly the best pro so far full of help and advice. You must have him back what about a Majestics four ball Westwood, Poulter. Stenson and you. Come on Rick make it happen.
Bravo Poulter for all the help and the win 🎉
Loved the video. Best one yet! Haven't laughed that much in a golf video ever.
What a legend Mr Poulter is. Fantastic video. The Ryder cup will not be the same without him. I hope golf finds a way for him to be captain one day. Nobody but nobody deserves it more.
That was the best challenge yet. I enjoyed Ian's commentary though out the round. As Rick said it was interesting to hear Ian's Thought process. Fantastic again
I love listening to Ian Poulter talking through his thought process!!!
That was amazing, thank you both
This was a great way to kill 2 hours on the sofa while its pissing rain. Fantastic
Poulter is a really cool guy, really comes across as a genuine good guy here.
I am 64 used to play of 18 thirty years ago now started playing again and off 21 with a set of Callaway edge perhaps you would like to invite me to your next challenge just to prove you are not that bad😂
This is brilliant
This course looks super tough if you not hitting it great of the tees, beautiful course.
Great video Ian is great! Don't forget you lost by 11 strokes!😉
Great video. Respect to you Rick and respect to Ian . Seeing him in a different lighy, what a nice guy.
I am 15 minutes in.  Going to make a cocktail to sit and enjoy the next hour and 41 minutes.
Rick I am a 13 handicap do u think I can beat a tour pro if I start -20
Ian was awesome, love the -10 challenge and this was the best so far. Ian was interactive and went professional on last 3 holes.
59:23 10th hole I can tell Rick was gonna slice like crazy his feet were way left of target but his clubface pointing right of target.. plus Rick that strong grip or yours is why you keep hooking/pulling left shots I think, I’ve noticed on a few vids you’ve got a strong grip
New found respect for Mr Poulter, and I was a fan of his Ryder Cup heroics anyway! Woburn just looks scary tight
That's why you do YouTube Rick😂
Great Video. reckon Poulter get lot more fans from this… Top bloke 👏🏻
Excellent match that of course ended with a match play scenario! Poulter didn't let us down even without his best game.
Love Poulter!
crazy game loved it with my best tour player
Very entertaining 👍
Loving Ian here. Nice normal guy
Lovely video, jusy greay fun. Like you said: Ian is great to have on a video, because he thinks out loud. Very nice to hear his thoughts.
Really was hoping you would beat him.
Great video Rick but you'd definitely be more comfortable and maybe be able to play better if you went up a trouser size.  For a man your size those ones you're wearing look really restrictive.  I've been through the same and it really helped.   Not trolling, I'm being genuine,  this would probably help.
The amount of info a pro tour player has goin on in his head is amazing....
missing plugin error @ 44min:32sec, just mentioning it bc i know what kind of quality u like to put out and would like to know this so u can fix, anyways awesome video as usual rick.. cheers..
Brilliant, really brilliant Rick. l think Ian is by far the best fun guy you have played in the pro -10 challenge.👍⛳️🏌🏌⛳️
Love the channel but that was the greatest fun, entertaining and compelling video I have ever watched on YouTube. Absolutely brilliant thanks Rick and Ian Poulter is just brilliant 😊
Best finish on this series
Rick personally I think that’s the best one yet. Ian poulter what a legend of the game.
Not easy playing golf in a forest. Great entertainment.
Love these videos!
Fantastic content! Absolutely love these ten shot challenges against the tour pros. When Rick hit the tree on 17 and Poulter turned into Muttley I was crying with laughter!   Thanks guys!
Who cares. I hope Poulter is enjoying his blood money.
Interesting to see Rick's alignment on the 10th tee off to the left. It wasn't that long ago your driving and tee shots were your strength.
Def your best 75 yet to top bloke's
That was epic
That was a lovely final well played hole Rick see u started out poor and finished great n strong that's Golf ⛳ now u want to play her again huh
I'd definitely have Ian in my 6 man Ambrose team.
Did you see how Ian had a damp towel to keep his clubs clean. Also giving advice to Rick all game. Love Ian, and this is one of the best Sheil's video i have seen.
What an excellent insight how a tour professionals play the game  well done rick 👍    thank you to Ian poulter  👍🇦🇺
By the 4th hole, I’m thinking a chainsaw might be a worthwhile addition to the bag😂.
IP the absolute legend.,....great watch Ric well done 🎉🎉
That was amazing episode
if it wasnt for double bogeys rick you would have won but the amount of putts Mr poulter shaved the hole the maybe not
Dont need liv players
Ian was made for social media and content! such a nice bloke, great video. What an insight into the thought behind his shots and what the potential risks are to hitting them. By far the best upload i have watched in a long time. just shy of 2 hours felt like 20 minutes 👏👏
One of the best pods & Pro  episodes; Poults is full value! Hope he comes back soon,maybe a Ryder Cup match play style episode.
Poulter is a stud! Like always this is great content! Love it Rick!!
Rick I love how you say you going to fade that in and you hit a perfect soft draw 😂😂.
I don't get how Rick wraps up for winter golf in the middle of summer..I would be so uncomfortable in pants and a jacket
Best one yet!
Absolutely brilliant video. Mr Poulter is still one of my favourite players and to hear him talk through what he is thinking is a privilege. Talented is the word and Rick, you did well as always. Great great video
Superb! Poult’s was a genuine sportsman. Loved his insights into every shot and also the advice he gave to Rick, no matter what the score. The last few holes were awesome!
I think it tightened both of u guys up
This is what it's about, Two mates Dicking about. Great video. Love these 10 shot Challenges.
What a gentleman, absolutely first class. 1:56:12
When Ian starts laughing at Ricks hooded punch tree killer I about lost it!  lol  Great video!
1:29  I just click this and I'll just predict that Rick can't. I'll come back to this later. 44:30  Missing Plugin 1:55:09  Yeap I'm right.
I'm sorry. Ian is the best golf youtuber on the planet, was just born slightly early, so had to make due with being a baddass pro golfer.
Always loved Paulter. Montgomery was the best at the Rider Cup. This video proves what a class act he is.
These are a pleasure to watch!!
30 seconds of ads every 6 minutes, most of which can’t be skipped, is frankly taking the Michael out of your loyal followers. Please don’t be greedy.
I’ll be honest if I had started that way on the first I’d have walked to the clubhouse! 🥹
Okay guys give up the golf course beat u both ❤😂
What a finish ,  better then medinah ryder cup.  Great match
This must be the best ”youtube golf video” ever made👏🏼
That looked a very tough course!
Rick. I asked this before and I know you don’t reply to comments but can you please explain this in a tutorial video perhaps. Why do you practice putt with left hand under right but then putt right hand below?
Absolutely the best in this series. Mr. Poulter was amazingly entertaining. Great Great video enjoyed every minute of it!
Always loved watching Mr Poulter through the years. Definitely a cracking personality with great insight. You've certainly pulled it off Rick so keep up the good work 👏🏼👏🏼
Absolute dog meat 😂😂😂
I'm sorry Rick I laughed too when u hit the tree it's ok Rick we all have done it
Great video.Was great to see the help and advice from Poults
Ian, what a great guest! His comments and help were spot on! Great Match! Rick you did great!
I’ve never seen so many ads on one YouTube video.  At least one, sometime two sets of adverts per hole!  You should apply to the Guinness book of records Rick! 😂
Wow what a video. By far the best one yet. Could watch Ian and Rick all day long.
Great video!!! Really lovely!
What I don't get here is why you play 10 over in these matches, but if you are doing a break 75 you are playing 3 to 4 over?  What is the difference?  Playing different tee'S?
Great fun! Couldn't stop watching now running late for work 😂
Double provisional. Best thing I have ever seen to start a video!!!!!
This is my favourite video Rick’s made. As a massive Poults fan, this was so awesome. A real intense finish too, what an awesome piece of content
One way to put a stop to those -20 scores especially for the professionals
So sick to hear all his insights and commentary, amazing vid!
You need to lose some weight Rick. It’s not your swing but your body that’s off
23:30 - Am I tripping, or does it look like they're in front of a green screen?? 🤔
LIV stuff aside, Ian seems like a great bloke to play with, very down to earth and was helping Rick all the way round. Really enjoyd it, best one yet.
Very good 💯🔥🍻
What a character, great video thank you.
I have Allways been a fan of Ian’s and the way he talked through his thought process was great. Along with his guidance for Rick and his humor made for a great video.
Bullard would pull your pants down 😂
Actually I never liked Ian Poulter! 🤷🏼‍♂️ Until now!  He‘s a great guy! 👌👏
Ya wadnt even beat connor Taylor starting at -10 man
The one everyone has been waiting for after the podcast! 🤌🏼
super fun video, boys
Ian got that saudi money drip
The shot of the match is at 1:42:54 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I don't think balls should be cleaned and picked up once on the green it would make it interesting a little more
What a legend. Not just Ian, but you 2.
Poults will always be a decent guy - if you 'hate' him, you don't get golf.... absolute ledge...
Did i just hear Rick Shiels say "I probably shoul've chipped it"?! Confidence must be growing Rick!
short game lesson paying off 😂
Great bud Ian is pure class. How does a average guy like my self who works all week but then would luv to come to these sort of courses on a weekend is it possible thanks Rick
Ricks developed this really annoying American “Daymn” and I can’t help but be triggered by it 😅
Maybe I’m a nerd but I LOVE hearing people talk through everything that’s happening. Incredible match!
Love the framing of these videos. "Can I lose to Ian Poulter by fewer than 10 shots" doesn't appeal to Rick...😁
This was the Ian poultry show 😂and can I just say absolutely riveting 👏👏👏👏
How did this get uploaded with the missing plugin screen in the middle? 😂
This was an incredible video and match! Ian is so entertaining and his thought process regarding what shot to hit and how to hit it was very enlightening. Ian's side comments to the cameraman were hilarious especially his facial expressions on some of Rick's riskier shot selections. Great video and thanks for sharing!
Rick isn’t really adopting that chipping lesson 😬
Brilliant episode
Worst shot of rick was hitting driver on 17, why Rick I was rooting for you.
Absolutely brilliant.....
The guy is a legend…. Seems to have all the time in the world for anyone
I have always been a fan of Ian. Such a nice guy and a fierce competitor on tour
Does anyone else cringe when Rick says damn
Fantastic video. Entertaining golf, what's not to like ⛳🏌️
Think how many beautiful courses there are in the world No doubt God loves ⛳ golf
What a great insight into a pros mind.. Scarey space 😂
This should be an annual match. Poulter is great on camera and the chemistry is great!
The editing in this video is phenomenal! Loved this video!
That the same 2 iron you said was coming out of the bag a bit ago or a different club?
Great vid…don’t care if golf is lacking…the entertainment is top notch…thx Rick
What a video. Ian was the best ever, helped Rick on every shot. Rick's 2 best shots he called a fade and hit a draw 😂 but still great shots. Poulter eyes came  out last last 2 holes to win. Just a great match and entertainment with a beer on a Friday night. Cheers Rick and Poults 🏌‍♂️👍👍
Think this is your best video yet. Poulter was great, so natural talking through each shot.
Amazing video, so much fun.  This seems ridiculous to say but: I was surprised by HOW MUCH IAN LOVES GOLF. I don't follow social except Youtube: seen him now and again in media portrayed as some kind of golf villain, also saw him in full swing and didn't think they presented him well. But this (and the pod) finally  showed his passion, fun side and even relationship with his son in a different light to me; infectious good vibes, I can count myself as a fan :)
If they put in some naughty strategic bunkers that would really put a stinger on it and your score card ♦️❤
What a great guy Ian is , good video to watch ,my favourite so fare in tour pro videos
Love Ian Poulter! Such a nice guy!!!
Even more of a Poulter fan after this!
You are flaring your wrists wide open on the takeaway and taking the club way inside. This is why you are hitting those huge hooks or slices.
Ian Poulter is one of the most genuine players out there. Entertaining, bloody great golfer and full of banter! Loved this one Rick! All down to the last….drama at its best! 🤙🏻
How can you not love poults after this video
I’m 4 mins in and am loving Ian 😂😂😂
My opinion of poulter has gone up after watching this. Seems a genuinely nice bloke.
I’ve missed this series!
What a beautiful Golfcourse
Really wish Rick would stop shaping shots so much to hit greens when a much straighter one would work much better and is much safer😂😂
I love these matches against pros! It’s really cool to see their personalities.
You missed out Frank Kennedy when you listed the people you've played in this.
Good putters and straight hitters would do well looks like to me I think u guys did rather well considering keep the matches coming great to watch reminds me me of some courses I've played here in Oklahoma USA
Epic Match! Poulter is a legend. Almost got em Rick. 🤙
Ian was so funny, loved every minute!!!
Ian Poulter is my Ryder cup super hero. Would be a dream come true to play such a great golfer and personality ❤❤
I new when that dramatic music started it was gonna be a short putt
FFS Rick, quiet your hands down through impact.  It's not hard, stop using your hands and wrists to be the dominant drive through impact....damn....
So much joy from this video. Thanks so much to all involved. Who is Rick Shiels you ask? He is someone not afraid to tell the world that he just whacked himself in the ankle with his putter. Something most people would keep to themselves. Genuine article.
Best one yet!
Lol never seen anyone do the opposite of what they say they intend to and get away with it so often 😂
Love hearing Ian talk through his round, and give an insight into what goes through his head. An absolute gem of a video!
Making him pull out Postie Mode is achievement enough.
Genuinely elite content this, could be right up there with one of my favourite ever videos!! You and Ian bounce off each other great and was class to see his thought on how he approaches the game tactically. Love the content rick, excited to see who you challenge next (Ten shot challenge with Tyrell has a nice ring to it👀)
Ian plays the camera very well .  Nice guy
Poulter is just a natural in front of the camera. This was honestly one of my fave vids from Shiels.
I love how Ian is explaining everything! What a video!
Tiger and his stinger shots might fair well there a good strategy maybe especially if we're windy too what a great course
Looks like to me , Rick you need to go back to the 425 max, and Ian you need to get rid of that damned Paradyme?
Love Rick, but his golf game has deteriorated over the past few years. Tough to watch
Matchplay and competitive legend on the one hand, gentleman and loving family man on the other. Superb stuff from both of you. Thanks very much. 🏌️‍♂️👍
I really liked Ian in this. He seems like a top bloke.
Poults was epic. As we all knew he would be.
one of the best videos from Rick. Ian is just a golf hero, love to watch him
What a fantastic vid and gent “polts” is. Defo changed my opinion of him after LIV. Rick proper class content well done… can I call you polts yet! 😅😅
Have not even watched it yet and I already know the answer.. NOPE
The postman is just a lovely guy. That’s why we all love him 🏌️‍♂️⛳️😁
I just think it would make a good open championship course huh
Now an Ian Poulter fan.. Hard to say that having watched him destroy my American golfers so many times:)Great Video👍🏻🏌🏿‍♂️⛳️
I played exactly the same last night Rick.  Pull an 88 on Tuesday and 101 last night
This golf course forces u to play down the middle no rippers could play this course without bumping some trees😂❤love it
I'd need a chainsaw to play there....
Walking off the 9th you realise big Rick has a set of cheeks on him 😂🍑
Great video. Great to hear the insight of a tour pro and the thought process. I think Ricks gotta step back and play more basic golf. His success rate of saying I’m gonna hit a cut here or a draw there do not pay off. I understand the pressure of playing with a legend like Poulter… it would give everyone the adrenaline shakes. I wanna see Rick back to his best again and the over analysis of shot shape looks to be causing issues.
You broke 75. That's not nothing.
The BEST episode I have watched! What a fantastic guy Ian is.
Wassup with 44:30? lol
Without doubt the best video on the channel! Fair play Poulter . The Postman always deliver 📮
The postman delivers again. Quality video, great insight into how quickly the tour pro assesses and visualises what’s in front of him. One of the best videos of its type I’ve seen.
Really enjoyable 👏🏼
Entertainment at it finest 😂
Never doubt the postman. Fantastic match.
A class golf courses deserve A class golfers
the sound is a little distorted innit?
That must be the most entertaining video you have made!
id love ti see rick against stenson
the look on Rick's face ... he has a man crush on Poulter
How many fucking adverts come up on your videos
Another great show from Rick!  Ian has always be one of my favorite pros.  Not just his golf talent, his personality and humor.   I now feel that if I had a chance/wish to play a round with any pros of my choice, it would be these two right here!  I don’t think I could have more fun playing with anyone else. Just awesome!👍
Never was a fan of Ian but he seems like a god dude.
genuinely funny and entertaining match against Poulter, the finish was something else as well. Love the fact Ian turned into his familiar 'tournament' mode at the end and took it serious, just shows why he was such a good match player
When Rick hit the tree when trying to hood one in the "safe" shot on 17 and Ian's face popped on screen, I legit spit my water out.  Great content with 2 amazing personalities.  Keep em coming Rick!!!!!
one of the best challenges, really enjoyed this one.
Uhhhh well. Love Ian! Really enjoyed that.
Great video chaps
What a legend. Would love to play a round with either one of you. Great game
"i don't think i can stop the spin" sounds like a good problem to have
You have no idea how much videos like this help me. Watching, hearing your thoughts, etc. Thx. SCD, Minneapolis MN. 3rd year of golf at age 77.
So many ads on this channel jeez
That’s probably the best thing I’ve watched on YouTube for a very long time!….your content is unbelievable 😁
Ian is just amazing. What a great episode of the 10 shot challenge!
Best video for a long time tbh. Superb poulter was Superb
What a great video so dramatic
Do we get a prize for pointing out the missing plug-in around the 44min mark 😂
I think Ian would make a damn fine YouTube golfer coach hybrid, his course management thoughts are so awesome! Would love to see him do commentary work if he doesn't do YouTube anyway!
Chipping 😮
Just top quality content
This is the best one yet. Brilliant entertainment from start to finish.
It looked like it was scripted. Such an entertaining video!  The postman did deliver indeed. “Never in doubt”.   These videos keep getting better and better. Keep it up!
Ian's second and third shots on the 14th.. sheer class! Another great 10 under video and what a great playing partner!
Another great one 👏 Ian is awesome to watch in this
Stop normalizing LIV.
Down to the wire. Ian was great!
Big fan of the missing plug-in Easter egg.
Why did Ian tap the side of the hole with the ball when he was talking the ball out the hole?
Would love to play a round with Ian so helpful and normal
So phenomenal!!! Ian is so a great guy!! luv it!!
That was the most enjoyable of this series so far, great viewing
At 1:21 in, you try and lay up with a 5 iron.  Not that I'm anybody, but I notice you slow your swing too much when concentrating on "lay up" / "safe" shots.  Maybe it messes up you mechanics?
You played bad, and that's on you Rick. Disappointed with your blasphemy and language as I watch with my 9 year old son who adores you...🤕
Keep Ian Poulter out of the US. I wouldn’t want him to be affected by some “rude Americans.” F him.
This course reminds me of Abergele GC. Tough
I must play on ice greens compared to this. Easy.
Look where your feet are lined up on 10th tee shot
I feel truly blessed to have this quality of content available. Thank you Rick for another fantastic video. Cheers mate.
When pulling up the video I was wondering why it was near 2 hours long. After watching the first 2 holes I understand why 😅 Love the videos Rick, keep it up!
Without a doubt the best video in a long time. Poulter is brilliant
Ian is clearly the nicest pro you've played with. He's the only one who seems to genuinely enjoy the game.
After watching your last video with Peter Finch I'd say no way in the burning pits of hades you win
amazing video!!!!!!!!!
You guys are so phenomenal. It was great fun to watch. It felt like two friends were playing. Thanks much.
One of your best videos. Loved it. Keep em coming lad
Like Rick said, a fantastic insight into a professional approach to playing our blessed game, great video as always Mr shields, and what can you say about Mr Poulter an absolute legend of the game.
Before watching this I would say most definitely yes. Poulter is going down hill fast
I wonder if Rick would mentally start out better if the pro started at +10 and Rick started at even.
Excellent video,  absolutely excellent.  Ian Poulter is so great,  so so great. This is entertainment
Get pissed before the game starts mate ❤
Real Gent Ian great vid
The muttley laugh at 1:43:19 is the best!! 😂😂😂
Does Ian not know his left and rights? 😂
This is pure gold, Rick. Ian's snickering at your errant shot out of the trees on number 17 was too funny. "You chose the safer route!"  What a great video, man! Thanks for doing these. You remind us that golf really is a lot of fun.
Thanks for making me feel better about my game.
Wow, that shot from the cart path for us amateurs is a “hit and hope” but Ian was confident in the shot and executed. Wow
Watching a first tee Rick makes me feel more nervous than he does 😂
Wow what a video and match. Ian was absolute class helping Rick out even though competing. That says a lot about his character well done. 👏
Gotta be 100% nerves on the front nines.
Possibly my favorite video of recent! What a bloke Ian was. Definitely need more Ian on the channel!
Best 10 under par of the series so far....................amazing  fun
I played Woburn a few years back when I was half decent and it destroyed me, lost 7 balls off the tee, it is one of the tightest courses ever, I thought I'd buried it forever but Rick this video brought it all back to me!!  - Fantastic video/content and Poults was absolutely brilliant, a total gent, keep 'em coming Rick!
Wow, amazing video and BIG thank you to Ian Poulter, what a nice guy! I really hope that Stenson would like to join this for the next one, that would be epic..... imagine his 3 wood....that is a beast. //cheers from Sweden!
2 HOURS?! wtf man
Loved that Rick best one yet what a great finish 👌🏻
Why does he always say “damn” like that haha?
So close again Rick .Well played Ian. 🏌‍♂️👍🍺🍺
It’s amazing watching Ian, how he cleans all his clubs immediately how he analyses each lie and wind conditions. Things you don’t realise he does unless you really watch him
What is the temperature out there? Complete opposite outfits lol
The way poulter thinks about each shot is fascinating
What a great guest Ian is, fantastic thanks guys!
Rick, why take Driver on 17? It's infuriating. Just play the correct club, which would've been your 3W
That ball hitting the tree…omg I’ve been pointer in the situation, watching buddy square up lumber. The sound of the tree, the look in the the shooters face. It’s near impossible to not laugh hysterically.
wow poulter hole 14
Absolutely brilliant video, Ian is such a great fella and this has been the best video to watch, thank you and well done to both of you for such an entertaining match,.! 👌🏽
Maybe switch to a two ball best shot against the pros over the 10 shot head start
This was unbelievable, Poulter has come across so well on this and podcast , a class act what a video!
Brilliant .Thank you very much.
I believe Ian poulter turned pro off of a 4 hcp which is mightily impressive getting himself to 5th in the world is a huge achievement
Ian just gets it!!!  🎉 Him sharing his thoughts on his shots as he plays is so awesome! Thank you for this series because you never get to be on this side of the ropes… incredible content!
Best video yet, Ian is a really good bloke.
Videos like this are why you remain by far and away the best golf channel. Great fun.
Best one yet. Poulter was class. Love the video
You're missing a plugin Rick!
Looking forward to watching this 🔥
This was a really great video. Great interactIon, with Poults coming across very well. I really liked the way he explained his process for deciding yardages and shots. Beat the pro is a good challenge and this potentially the best to date 👍
When Rick was whispering in the cart it felt a little like he was watching a wild animal in it's natural habitat lol
2 of the GOATS
This episode was utter brilliance. Obviously Ian didn't have his best day, but like a true pro he saved his best for last, and took the win. The way he shared his thought process on every shot was just one of the best things I ever witnessed on a golf course. I think Rick really got Ian's attention after quite a rocky start, where Ian could have easily been thinking "oh boy, what did I get myself into", But Rick's redeeming shots really turned the whole atmosphere around, and left you not knowing exactly what you would see next, an utterly phenomenal shot or another journey through the forest. Just great, and a special thank you to Ian Poulter for really taking up the spirit of the game and being so entertainingly involved, a real joy to watch....
This course is so sick
Rick - I always get a bit frustrated with your bias to playing a draw on every long to medium club. Your mind's eye sees everything as a draw (you say it prior to most shots) and it costs you several strokes per round!
Ian is one of my favorite golfers. Match play WARLOCK!
Next drinking game: Take a shot every time Rick says "damn".
OMG, hitting that tree on 17 and Ian Poulters reaction was priceless! I haven’t laughed so hard in years.
What a belter of a video!  Seems like a great lad to play a round of golf with.  Thank you both for making this happen for us to see.
Your own negativity is your worst enemy (just saying) good watch
These videos always make me like these tour pros more than simply watching them play on the tour week to week.
Id love to play a round with Ian.
Just dishing up a spag bol, thats Friday night sorted
Ian Poulter, what a nice guy, these 10 shot challenges are my favourites, keep them coming.
Hey Rick. Really enjoying your match with Ian.  I do enjoy hearing his self-talk prior to making his shot, very interesting.  I notice you don't practice you putting stroke from just in front of your ball prior to making your actual stroke?  You seem to take a few strokes from behind the putt, but don't you think you'd get better "visual input" by making more meaningful practice strokes from just in front of the ball? Cheers.
Ian is such a legend, what a good oke! This is the content I signed up for.
Anyone notice the "Missing Plugin" at 44:31?
My slice would never work on this course 😂 I’d lose every ball I own
What was there not to like about that video?  absolutely fantastic Mr Charismatic Rick Sheils and ( what is there not to like) Ian Poulter, that will be hard to beat 👍
Dude can play. Seems to be a hybrid of Faldo and Montgomery, in terms of determination, confidence and personality. No womder the dude can play.
Wanted to watch the whole thing before commenting, and as a high handicapper, this is going to sound outrageous but.......for gods sake Rick, put your driver away on tight courses and use old bluey...!!
Ian is pure comedy... when Rik hits the tree his reaction is comedy gold.
What a nice chap Ian is
Ian! What a host and player. Great video Rick and awesome skill and commentary from Ian.
It would literally take me 3 dozen balls to play here
You could have easily made this a 40 minutes video,  no need for 50 seconds of deliberation before every shot and still double as often as you do .
2 hour video on a rainy Friday, life’s good
Ian was absolutely fantastic.  He was built for YouTube.  Great video!
Ian sharing his course management and insight on each shot is so interesting to hear. Such a great guest
That 3 wood by Ian with the ball below his feet has to be one of the best golf shots I have ever seen! I loved the comment on the green about how his caddie would have killed him for even suggesting it 😂! As always, great content! How about a challenge with Matt Fitzpatrick, Cameron Smith, or Matt Finau?
You wouldn't believe the amount of time I saved constantly fast forwarding through all this useless talking every God damn shot . Absolutely ridiculous , just play golf and have fun.  No one cares whats going through your mind every 2 seconds
Rick for heavens sake. Start working on your routing more! you are a pro golfer and 20 hcp golfers have better pre shot routine than you.
I bloody love Ian Poulter.
You can definitely see why Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood get on!! 57:17
Stunning video, Ian come across as such a nice guy also is very entertaining to watch, best 10 under video so far. 👍
I've said it before Rick, but to many after long week at work, these longer Friday night videos are like therapy. I sit smiling and laughing all the way through. Thanks and keep them coming. 🥇⛳
Bar none the best Pro 10 under game to date, really entertaining Poults is a great guy.
Notice one big difference between the pair is that Mr Poulter cleans all his clubs after every shot.
hey rick after the first hole ....i'm thinking you might want to start -20....lol
the editor in me is hurting editor of this video at 44:28. lol I hope the editor is doing okay! I can imagine editing these long form videos!
Best one yet!! ❤
Any luck finding that plugin?
real class ian poulter
rick got enough layers on?  Poults in shorts, rick in longs and longs?
Epic, an understatement. Ian is such a character and why we loved him on the Ryder Cup. Was lucky to play the Dukes course after the Masters many moons ago. A fantastic place. Need another visit.
Am I the only one who found the missing plugin section?
Come on Rick sort your game out lad. About time you won one of these
Does that new H.I.T simulator help your chipping yips? Hard to imagine for how often you play, for the chipping to continually be this woeful!!!!!
What an amazing video. Ian Poulter was fantastic, especially the way he talked thru his shots. You could tell that around the 14th hole he was in full match play mode and wanted to win.
Sorry, not sorry. Priceless from Poults
Rick is actually brutal at golf 😂
Cracking game, Ian Poulter always delivers though Rick when he needs to
I've always assumed that Poulter would be a jerk because of how competitive he is. But between your podcast with him and this video, he might be one of my favorite golfers now. He seems so nice, but just turns on during competition.
That was an absolute worldy of a video. Great stuff. Poulter is such a legend and seeing him in behind the facade he plays, on here and in the podcast, was fantastic.
For me by far the best video until now.... top top top.... Ian was joy to watch
Shiely boy
I don't know how you do it Rick, these just keep getting better. Good laughs, stunning course and great shots from you both!
That was the best , loved it well done rick
Bloody epic. Such a nice guy. The wood to the edge of the bunker was my favourite shot.
My favourite ever Rick Shields video I think. Ian looked a great sport - well done team Shields!
What a video start to finish.  Ian was so genuine and entertaining.  Great pairing!
That golf course is diffently not a links course
The editing on this video is amazing
Gin poured ! Let’s go boys
Sometimes I wonder whether Rick’s actually played golf before! 😭😂
Thought he wanted to play less golf , Majestic !
Hi rick, I am a crap player now, was an 8 h'cap. I think that you are more interested in showing the pro's that you can shape the ball. I am certain that you are capable of  hitting a straight shot with all your clubs, I believe you would win the ten shot challenge if you just hit it straight.
Brillant video Poults was mega
I swear Rick works ten days a week
I’m an American and this guy is Ryder cup nightmare when pressure calls, I love guys with guts that bring it even when they aren’t playing well. 👍 No surprised he won at the last when it counts but good try Rick. 👏🏻
superb :)
Why would you toe down on a tight lie, that's opposite of how to play it? lol
Is it just an English thing to say one-four-six for yardages instead of one-forty-six? Also, Rick, your edit team needs to render some plugins around 44:33!
What a great watch that was, loved it. Well done to both of you, pure entertainment from start to finish.
Ian: What's your normall shot shape?   Rick: You know what the fun bit is?  Multiple options.   Boy if that ain't the truth for me.
An absolutely fantastic video  Loved every second and what a contest 🔥
Ian looks to be a great playing partner, the kind of guy you would play your best golf with. Awesome episode!!!
truly amazing to watch
Honestly Ian what a top bloke. was so funny and such a class golfer, was one of the best matches I have seen! well done Rick keep it up!!
Ian Poulter  ,  a top quality guy .
You’re playing with a tour pro and not doing anything he’s suggesting. I’m not a Poulter fan but I’d have been writing things down all the time he spoke. Ok so I would have time to play my golf.🤪 but would have been worth it.
What a great video to see, with the cometary from Ian Poulter, how much do you rely on shaping the ball, looks like it is a lot? can it be too much in a game.
Ian Poulter is such a funny and cool fellow.  It's a tie between him and Joel Dahmen for the Tour Pro I'd most like to grab a beer with.
This is a great video!  Love Ian's vibes paired up with you.    Also...can we smash that subscribe button to get you to 3 million subscribers?!?!?  Let's go Rick!
what a top man Poults is!!!
Thanks lads absolute bliss 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Another amazing video. I've been binge watching your videos over again and really enjoy them. There aren't many people on this planet that wouldn't feel nervous or intimidated while playing with Ian Poulter. Never doubt yourself.
Would be cool to see you challenge some fans on their course and give them 10 strokes.
Definitely my favorite 10 shot challenge video, one of my all time favorites. Poulters engagement was perfect. Well done.
As an American when I here the name Ian Poultar I think I can’t stand that douche (because of the Ryder Cups) but now that I’ve seen this he seems like a genuine gentleman and a great guy.
So that day I played Woburn birdied the drop hole par 3 met Ian putter and made it into your video 😊
Can't watch now but I'm going to say No😂
Imagine Ian didn't give Rick so much advise it probably wouldn't of been as close as it was, class act
If Mr. Poulter wasn’t such an amazing golfer he would have been an incredible teacher.
What a match !! Unbelievable
Rick , that was one of the best golf videos I have ever watched , it was so entertaining and kept me gripped all the way . Excellent side comments from Ian 😂 . Loved it
More of these Rick!  Love this format!
Love Woburn, it might be the best course ive played.
Rick: “Riight, at it with a little bit of fade”…  Hits a draw.
Ian's par on 7 was UNREAL
Brillo...  love your videos,  me and the missus are moving to Scotland,  haven't sussed out where yet, but it'll be near a golf course
The best one yet by far, really enjoyed. Some great shots, few lucky ones and loads of laughs, marvellous entertainment
Ian seems like a great guy to play with. Was encouraging and helpful. Great stuff Rick
Brilliant, well done both.
1:43:14 that face encapsulates this whole video
One of the most entertaining video’s you have done. Hats off to Poults 👏
I love how people talk trash about a man that saw an opportunity to make a better living for his family. I like Ian and it shows what kind of person he his at heart in this video, him and Rick in a competition and yet his acting as Rick's caddy. Great video 2 great guys
Of all the professionals in the world i would pick to play a match against. Poulter would be top of that list. Class dude and super competitive. I love his game. The whole time I watched this I thought man..Rick should do one of these with Stenson..and Ian got me on that too!
Awesome match!  It’s his eyes Rick….Ian has that look that wins match play.
Great video - Thoroughly enjoyed that. EPIC!!!
Just so entertaining. Ian’s laugh when Rick hit the tree was hilarious - mean but hilarious!
2 hours of a Rick Shiels masterclass
How bad at golf has Rick Shiels become. He is easily an 8 handicap
You know I'm watching the whole thing because 44:30. Such a good watch so far
I think Rick VS Ian's younger son would be a better match for Rick. LOL. He would probably get battered by him too! LOL.
Some of Ian's shots were absolutely criminal....but I guess he's got unlimited "get out jail free" cards. What a player.
Loved hearing Ian's "thoughts" & banter ... @Rick ... your heavenly name calling ... not so much
Rick you gotta get rid of that handsy first move!!!
Rick "duff" Shiels is back baby!
Great as ever. I'd love to play golf with IJP, comes across really fun
What Rick needs to do is get rid of the snap hook...Since he already has a weak grip, the swing path will need to change... And isn't it illegal to use laser slope in competition? Poulter was using it on every shot...
Poults is a proper legend, what a nice guy and a European golf hero
How is Rick so bad I thought he was a pro
You’re best video of the series yet!!
Haven't watched it yet but no. 😅
if you cant beat poults you not got much chance against any other tour player
Its a great replacement  for Top Gear.. - A Star vs a reasonably priced golfer... ha ha ha
Ian I think God is telling u be easy on Rick lol
Absolutely love seeing this side of Poults. My guy needs a YouTube channel!
We love Ian Poulter! Don’t Poke the BEAR!!
There is nothing about this golf course I would enjoy lol.  Every fairway so far looks like a hotel hallway.
44:28 Woops! :P
Ian’s a class act it seems. Ignore the haters  Was my favourite golfer before this because of The Ryder Cup. But now it’s cemented it
“Dayum” every 5 minutes 😂😂
That was excellent and what a great guy Poults is. So entertaining listening to his thought process
Rick talks a good game but is bloody hopeless... Lol..
Why would you badmouth the LIV golf league and then play a round with one of the players???
this has become my fave Rick Shiels video!
That’s the best one yet the postman is a legend 👏🏾👏🏾👌🏾👌🏾
This maybe the hardest damned course I have ever seen?
This is the year of great golf❤
What fantastic content. Ian Poulter is a pure joy to watch and can banter with the best of them. Great episode Rick 👍
Ian has always been a European favorite.   There has been several times I have rooted for him over an American player during Ryder Cups and President Cups.  Great stuff Rick.  I love this series.
18 adverts on the front nine. Taking the piss son
great vid
This was the best one yet. Great job Rick!
No you can't and that's based on your last video with the other two guys lol. Anyhow good luck
Favorite video so far Rick! Enjoyed the video filming format with less cuts and getting to hear more information around the important shots. Big props to your editors!
very familiar with how Rick played that first hole
Ricks psych game needs work..  every other shot he says what he needs score-wise... setting yourself up for pain. Just play it shot by  shot and do the best you can?
Shouldn't Ian be Washing Sports somewhere? LIV Filth.
Magnificent video well played.
Shot…advert…shot….advert…shot…advert!!
Absolutely brilliant video 👏
Poulter still to win a Major. That would complete his career now he has played Rick.
Poulter is clown. I was the superintendent of grounds at Harbour Town in 2003 or 2004 Ian drove through a flower bed at the entrance of HT clubhouse. And acted like a total scumbag  when me and 5 state troopers watched him do it.
Stoked for this one!
Wow!  What an entertaining match!  Great stuff.  Glued to my phone for 2 straight hours!!!
Love that Ian's son is there hanging out with Dad.
Just started watching and I bet Rick swings it too quick.
Poulter is a good guy, and a Ryder Cup killer.
Ian is such a classy guy! Probably my favorite so far!
Rick you are taking the piss with adverts on this video. FFS man give it a restm
Ian is a top guy!
Rick remember u played Nick Faldo too
Missing plugin? 😂😂😂
I already know the answer to the video title but I love watching these videos. However, I think Rick is a bit embarassed by his game atm. The decline over the recent weeks is seriously noticeable. The scramble 65 with Pete was rather shocking. Pete carried him the whole way round. Rick talks a good game but he needs to do some serious work on his swing.
I love Ian Poulter.  I know some will mention him in the majors and all, but for me what he did a Madinah - just wow. To be able to play next to a player who got 5 birdies in a row under the most intense Ryder Cup pressure must be a privilege. Pure passion, heart and soul - as I said I love it.
Lucky Ian didn't choose to play you on the Duchess Course as I think there would have been quite a few more Provisionals played.🤣🤣
I liked Poults before watching this and I’m not disappointed, your a lucky boy Rick 👌
I loved it when you were super bullish on the putt and Poults idly commented that he could never read this 'difficult' green. Result you ended up 10' short🤣
Great Match
Poulter’s looks to the camera when Rick hits a poor shot or misses a putt were comedic. It was proper David Brent style.
really enjoyed this rick but my god how many adverts through this vid drove me mad
Thanks for a great video! Min 44 there is an issue💪🏻
Is it just me or is Rick and Ians audio slightly distorted?
Inner what?
Love how Ian was describing the course. Just a great video
Captain of Majesticks. One of sports most pointless titles. Everybody is captain of Majesticks 😂😂😂
Really enjoyed this, bit tight off the Tee
I can imagine just how intimidating it would be to play against Mr Poulter.
well ricks going to get  cooked after watching the first two holes I already know who will win, lets get better rick
I can’t understand the hype around Rick. He’s pretty bad at golf for a pro with all the advantages he has through his presence on YouTube.
Is it a seven shot challenge as you walk off the first tee. Interesting🤔
Like before watching the video 🎉
Hahahahaha first tee
Missing plugin 😂
Quality.  Ian is a good lad, I hope he makes the Ryder Cup somehow.
ian is a beast on camera
LIVing the dream Ian is. Hopes theres no money involved.
Even though he's missed a few, Ian's putting looks very smooth compared to Rick, not that Rick is bad. But it just looks smoother to me.
Legendary content. Keep it coming Shielsy!!!
The people who give that smug prick Poulter millions of pounds chop the heads off teenagers, homosexuals and mentally disabled people. Shame on you for this Rick
Would be great to see a 10 shot challenge against Rory
44:28 Needs a provisional Plugin...
17 mutley laugh😂
I love how Rick calls what shot he’s gonna play, and then hits something totally different, ONE OF US
Rick is the worst 6 handicapper
What a video. Poults is such a considerate player. Top bloke.
rename the video  :is that gone gone?
Wow, best match to date.  A blast to watch, Ian is awesome.
Got to love ricks face every time Ian hits a golf shot! He's like a kid in a sweet shop 😂
More Ian Poulter please. 👏
When Ian chips off the path and puts it near Ricks face is one of genuine awe, these videos are brilliant.
I just don't understand how people can feel negatively about Poults. He's such a nice guy and this shows how supportive and game of a playing partner he is. Great episode.
Awesome Poulter will always be my favourite English golfer! What a legend.
Missing plug-in……? Is that rick looking for the balls he hit off the first tee?
I know for everyone they dislike Poulter, but I generally think he’s a good dude and good representation for the game of golf.  He’s helping Rick through out each of his holes they are.
Missing plugin XD
Well done guys. Ian is such a great sportsman.  One of the best videos Rick cheers.  Made my day
anyone who didnt enjoy that dosent play golf that was an epic vid the banter was top draw well done both
Love Ian, he’s a true professional.
Missing plug-in?
I have to admit something here. As an American, and huge fan of the Ryder cup; I would look forward to any match that Ian was a part of just as much as I was for any American golfer. Ian is an absolute Legend of the Ryder Cup and was just pure joy to watch as a sportsman. He just has a grit that you fall in love with as a competitor. But I never knew any other side of him, and after seeing the podcast; I am going to admit that I am a proper fan. Ian is a great competitor for sure, but he seems to be a true gentleman and family man. Rick this is what golf is all about and what it was meant to be when the game was opened up to the world. Another great video and I look forward to many more like this. Ian was a great host and even though neither played great there was some signs of greatness from both Ian and Rick. Guys this was just so much fun to watch, but if I am being completely honest; I was hoping to see a bit more of the chest pounding Ian come out and take over the match....LOL   I am now a huge Ian Poulter fan and grateful that I had a chance to see the podcast and experience this round with Ian and Rick. SHIELS ARMY!!!!!!! LETS GO!!!!
yes rick I love it! great vid
Download those plugins Rick 😂
Rick is so bad it’s ridiculous
Ian needs to play against American players then he will shoot -20 under. Needs blood in his eyes
Poulter is a gem.  I love these videos.
🥰🍺🍺Ian Poulter  Rick Shiels ☕☕🎂🏆
I always thought Ian was a little too much arrogant when he first burst on the tour.  As he has aged he seems to be a little more mellow and definitely someone I always root for to do well.
Poulter is quite camp. You go girl.
What a guest today!
Rick would do so much better in these if the tour pros started +10 and Rick at level. Then they would feel pressure to make birdie instead of Rick trying to hold on.
Love the series. Love the content. Love seeing Woburn. Love it all.
Anyone else like the video before even starting it ?
Ian is the best, great vid!
Holy Siht.... Has Rick Shiels ever played b4?
Great commentary from Ian. A good lesson.
5th hole 2nd shot from rick. Ill do a nice little fade. Yer great shot. The shot was lucky shot as he got a draw 😂 then does the same on the par 3 back 9. Nice little fade but then ends up with a draw
Missing plug-in at 44:28? Interesting lol
2 hours? I could play golf in that time 😅
How much of his oil money did he give  before this started?
I can't stand Ian Poulter, but in fairness - he was very conversational and personable in this video.
Missing Plug-in was my favourite part, been wondering what transition was supposed to play 🤔
Class act!!! So close!! If only you could have pieced your round together like you hit the ball on 18, you probably would have won!! 18 hole was great golf 😁😁
This just shows the difference between an elite golfer and a good golfer.. then there's me, shooting 80+ on the front 9
Ian is phenominal. Rick rubbish.  Do you ever listen to the pro giving you advice? Do you ever play your audio back and listen negative you are?
been waiting for this, Ian's pod was one of my favs
Bring on Charley Hull for the next Match in Woodburn😅
First tee and I'm already in tears
I can’t be the only one watching this match over the Scottish Open.  Great content!
That's my night sorted, takeaway and Shiels V Poulter 👍
Ian sippin that fireball first hole
missing plugin
If that 3rd par 3 is SI18 I would be bang in trouble with the rest of the course! 😂
44:33 you're missing a plugin guys 😀
I would be thoroughly embarrassed if played golf like you with so many viewers watching.  Please stop.  Your are not that talented
Embarrassing
Pride of LIV
What a great video. Watched pretty much all of it with a smile on my face. Well played both!
Always liked Ian and he has always been an awesome competitor.
Ian started 10 strokes back on the 1st tee box, by the time he hit his 2nd shot he was already 3 strokes ahead
hopefully you know when you're playing bad that it's ok, we the viewers really enjoy watching you. you're entertaining and get to do some really amazing things many of us only dream of. we all know how frustrating it can be, playing golf sometimes. but at the end of the day... what's better than this?
Great video. But I’m on hole 3 and on advert 5 😂
Pressure is not your friend Rick. Blocks and snap hooks are way to common. Work on that.
having been a majesticks fan my entire life this was so much fun to watch! Poulter will go down as a top 5 majesticks player of all time when he decides to retire. pure class
Rick when I start off like that the jacket comes off. Wonder if that would've made a difference. EDIT: I make this edit because 1 min later the jacket came off and the shots started improving.
RICK....ugggggg, leaving an EAGLE Putt short.....ayeeeyaayeee.
Absolutely brilliant video well done lads 👏👏👏👏
I’ve been trying to find them everywhere but what golf shoes are they that Ian is wearing?!
That par 4 save by Ian. My word.
Brooo we didnt ask for this and wow its gonna deliver
I’ve never wanted to see Rick win a match more than this one.
Love ur channel Rick! You’ve gotten a lot more positive over the years, it’s fantastic to see! I bet if you started being more positive and keep the positive energy up with that, than your game and channel will increase I’d bet. It’s made a tremendous difference in the people I play with as well as myself. Check out the positivity with how all the gr8 players do it. It’s always positive feedback, and good ways to hit the ball too. You look at the good, good , good, then your focus is on what to do, not what not to do. Negative reinforcement changes the way your looking at the strike and where to get the ball to end up. Anyways. Keep up the awesome work, I love the new channel too and you are going to get to that million subs! Right”!! (:;:;(;
Rick, all you do is golf and make youtube videos for a living. How are you not jacked? Doing your body and image a disservice.
This is by far my favorite video from Rick.  Hearing the thought process from Mr. Poulter was absolutely amazing.
What a finish!!! Incredible video! Really enjoyed watching Ian, he’s a really likeable guy.
Does Ian shave his legs? Lol great video. Two holes in and this could be a blood bath 😳 hope Rick calms down and enjoys it
I really wish Ian had won a major at some stage. He has been brilliant for British/European golf
Great bit of advertising for the Majestics merch as well.
Missing Plugin 🤣
Ian is actually helping and giving Rick alot of reads and advises as he plays.
Great video! I love your fantastic content on YouTube Rick. I am a big fan of Mr Ian Poulter.
These just get harder and harder to watch
What a great guy Poulter is .
Rick has every shot in the bag. He truly can play great golf, but good lord I don't know anyone who gets in their own head as much as Rick Shiels. Just relax and and have fun Rick, golf is what you do brother!!!! Great content as always!
"Missing Plugin" 44.30
love this content !
That course though! How many golf balls are lost there?  Holy cow!!!
I’m only two holes in but it’s nice to see Rick Shiels is human. Three off the tee on the first hole, been there mate 😂 can’t wait to watch the rest
Majestic video mate
Not even started watching properly yet but I already KNOW this is gunna be amazing!
Commentary of Ian talking over not only his own but Rick's shot was spectacular.
2 hours might be a bit too long imo. 1 hour max if you can
rick youre way better than me at golf.....but man you suck too!! hahaha love ya mate
1:42:55
I'm only on the 2nd hole and Ricks game is making me cringe😂
Probably obvious but Poulter does seem massively below the standard of the other tour pros from this challenge. Still enjoyed though!
2 hours??  lets go!
Top quality so far Rick. Great work you and Poults
Missing plugin at 44:28. What's that about?
I love to see throughout the day, the more impressed they all are with Rick.  Brilliant banter between both 🎉
Loving this Rick! This is the same course you played in the golfbidder challenge? Great content as always.
@14:13 "Very in-treegued" What a perfect choice of word Rick🤣 He is quite literally in the tree
You can dress it  up anyway you want,, hes not a tour pro ,,, aint we lucky,, he will never play or manage a Ryder Cup Team
Still watching but had to comment on the 3rd hole, I’d lose all my balls on there 😂
Draw😂 Hook more like.
Love these episodes
What a GREAT video and what a cool, funny, no ego man Poulter is.  SUCH A JOY to watch.
What a shit show.
Seriously? 8, 20 second unskipable ads in the first 9 minutes? Come on, that's a bit much, you're already loaded.  geT ad BloCKer
Double bogey on the 1st par 5, I can do that 🤣
what a course!
Can’t lie, these are my favourite ones
Thanks Rick for playing with Ian Poulter he is on of my most favourite player of all players , I love him to bits for his  courage and fighting spirit,
This is crazy he is my idol
I am not a betting man, but if I was i would put a lot of money that that wasn't ricks ball off the 1st tee
Loving how everyone is pumping out longer videos all of a sudden. I love having something to keep me entertained in the background while I work.
I think your sound guy needs revisit his settings... usually the audio is fine, but here it was just recorded way too hot and clipping. Honestly, might not be a bad idea to record a safety track just in case...
Yeah, Happy Friday. keep up the great work. Ian will be telling all his friends he got to play with you.
Does Rick start each -10 match with a double bogey?
Ian’s always been one of my favorites, from the frosted tips and cobra visor days
Are we sure RS is a golf Pro ???
Stop eating sausage rolls.
I played there that day, and birdied that 1st par 3
I've been waiting for this video for 2 weeks now😂
2hr video Rick, that's the evening sorted 👌
Now you reach hole 3 and there are only 5 shots left. Your golfen us so poor till this Moment Rick so that i have no fun to watch and waste many time. Always if it counts you play awful golf with shots i wouldn't do after 20 years without golf. I'm a old man but i would gage scored always and ever even or one over the for this first holes. What's going on with you and your game? The best clubs, the best coaches and nearly daily practice and then this. Sorry, for me is thats all a huge fake and i belive nothing in whatever you abd your channel seems to be. That's all fake, a huge "scam" nothing else. Sorry
A near 2 hour new Rick video... Happy Friday everyone 👌
Nice! I really enjoy Ian. One of the all-time great personalities in Pro golf.
You guys need to sort out the audio. Microphones are distorting consistently. It's fine when they're talking at a normal level. Belt pack gain sensitivity needs adjusting.
love the vid, if only Ricky could've broken 80 he woulda had this one
NGL that was poor Rick
Every single golfer has started just like this.  Crazy game.
Rick nervous around Poulter but maybe Poulter should be nervous around one of the most influential people in golf 😂
Loved hearing the inner dialogue from Ian shot by shot! A true professional!
surely, it's Poults that needs the 10 shot lead in this one?
"Draw"...hook...whatever works.
Poults top top guy
1st hole stud all over Ian’s line 🤦🏼‍♂️
Can’t wait for this
No wonder the video is 2 hours long it takes Rick 3 balls off the first hole to get in play.😂
Could you do a what's in the bag before rounds start, so we can see what clubs your opponents are using?
WAIT. RICK TO LIV CONFIRM!!! Love to see the collaboration
Poulter in shorts and a t shirt and Rick wearing pants and long sleeves.  Funny the comparison really
Poltz is cool man. Saw him at LIV Miami last year
Impossible to beat these guys if they are playing their home course
what a course
Rick, with the current state of your game, you couldn't beat Ian with a -15 start.  I could probably beat you these days.  Ok, with 15 you would have beat him.  I was wrong.  I'm just joking about all this of course.  Fun video.  Ian's a good dude.  But he wanted to win for sure.
Love these match ups !!  you might win one soon Rick
Rick loses yet again!
Poulter is such a great guy. Great content, as usual
Rick you need to stop calling shots before you hit them
Ian cracks me up sometimes 😂
Imagine getting the chance to play a legendary clutch player, who is still playing amazing golf later in his career. Ian Poulter must feel very lucky
Awesome video!!!
Shielsy and Poulty!  🥹 This is how you start off a Friday!
Thanks for the great content!
2 hours... nice!!!
Ian poulter 🤢
Love to see it!
Great Job Rick Ian is one of my favorite players.
I’m supposed to be tidying the house or the missus will shout at me… this video takes priority 😂
That 3 off the tee on Hole 1 was a proper head mess from Poulter 🤣
As a golfing watcher, what would the situation have been if you couldn’t have found your first provisional shot after ‘losing’ your initial tee shot? Would you just carry on as if you’d not played your initial provisional so on your 3rd shot or if you were using your 2nd provisional shot would you then be on your 5th shot??? (Have I explained that correctly?)
Its Friday. Its more great content from Rick!!!
Had a right miserable day and this has just cheered me up, cheers haha :)
Only 5 mins in but the banter is great. Looking forward to this one!
Love these videos 🔥
Please do a reverse scramble. Play from the worst ball!
Epic
How very honest of you to leave the first hole in and not start again!! 😂😂😂
Screw that guy
Wow. Getting to play a round with Ian Poulter has to be awesome. I’d try to find the wackiest pants I can to challenge his dressing 🤣
The one we’ve all been waiting for
Been looking forward to this one 💥🏌‍♂️
Nice!! a near 2 hr video to get me through to the end of the work day and beyond.
IJP is awesome!
Get Shane Lowry on the show 🇮🇪
Poults is a plonker who goes to foreign countries and pets exotic animals
I have been looking forward to this !
These are my favourite videos, I’m so excited for this. Rick you deliver the best content on YouTube .❤
Amazing how Ian gets a bad rap occasionally . Seems like great guy to spend e day with or have on your team!
Can’t wait to watch this. Two of my favourite characters/Golfers.
Love this format 🎉
You already beat him at being a likable human being.
Postman and the journey man. lol
BUZZZZING FOR THIS

I don’t even need to watch the video yet before liking it, already know it’s going to be amazing
Hey Rick. Did you take my advice about your drive

Poults. Awesome.  When you getting Golf Sidekick on? Or at least Golf Mates?
Uploaded before 4pm…winner Rickaaaaay!!
I'll watch in a bit, but my guess would be no? Wow!
Who cares? I am surprised you can afford the £1million fee he needs to play a round of golf.
First boop...
