This was my favorite for almost 4 years now,

My goal over the next, like, week or two is to learn every word to the bridge of this song and be able to sing it WITHOUT looking up the lyrics online.
This song , It is me.
“My sadness is contagious” is so real
I hate him
October 18, 2025? Anyone? 😩💕
Where are you falling ? Heaven ?Paradox ?after falling, still have the chance to flying rise up
who remembers that fan made Midnights Visual Video that was on Youtube before Hits Different was avalaible on streaming? i still have it in my mind when i listen to the song
OH MY LOVE IS A LIE
Tell me why Ive never heard of this song an I love it
22 hours I am crying 🧡🎉😭
4 MORE DAYS TILL TLOAS
Can't believe most of these songs is about her pining about Matty Healy.  She made up this IDEA of him in her head, swooning for years.  How many times did he rock her world in bed?  He took the best of her 20's.  That's the tragedy.
Anyone else hearing this a LOT in Lady Gaga’s How Much Do U Want Me?
affs amo essa
I am obsessed 💙💙💙💙💙
❤ Beautiful
Rating: 4/10 Favorite line: a wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes Comments: ironic that a song titled Hits Different is a retread of a topic she's done a billion times. And it hits decidedly the same
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Sad song .. but the chorus sounds like a very happy, ecstatic wishy  blonde Taylor ready to board her private jet to Las Vegas.
In the second verse, she sings, “I used to switch out these Kens, I’d just ghost… freedom felt like summer, I can feel that 😢
TE AMO TAYLOR SWIFT LOPEZ
3:11
Vivement le mariage ❤😂 2:38
Taylors catchiest song. From a different person of the same name.
This song hits different
我很訝異於泰勒絲用如此輕快的旋律來唱出如此心痛的歌曲，它驚艷了我對於音樂的想像，它絕對不會輸給這張專輯裡任何一首更加知名的歌曲，它證明了一首歌的成功不會被流量所定義！
this still hits different
3:13
I don't know how this woman can write these amazing songs and I always feel them on such a personal level
Medium i understood
hi taylor swift
I swear I’ve had this on repeat for I don’t know how long at this point
Checking out some of the natural wonders we might visit some day in your turf.
Has anyone noticed that the last song from midnights album "Hits Different" ends with the lines "is it you? or have they come to take me away" ..and the first song from TTPD "Fortnight" starts with the lines "I was supposed to be sent away but they forgot to come and get me" 🤯 Coincidence? I think NOT!
12M
"Argumentative antithetical dream giiiiiiiirrrrlllll"😍😍😍😍😍💯❤
I don’t forget you😢🎉
By the way. Tell the Gossip Gang that my phone is spyed by most of everyone. So those spicy things get spread in places we really dont want to be spread. So need some new ways to communicate about those. Like having brunches and flashdrives for example. As my name cant be tied with the steameast of stuff those wild romance novels might lead. And I do still enjoy a bit of lustful sagas on writing.
What you say if I would like to "be in space with my thinking" as in maybe reading a book in our living room and you do whatever you want as an evening "what we are doing now"? I would enjoy presence a lot, would like to have someone to talk to and touches would make things just better along the way.
Come the Carmel Beach, the sand is so nice and soft. It won’t hurt your feelings! 🥰
Taylor is rly the best (in my opinion). Idk what I’d do with out her when I listen to her music it calms me down and gets rid of my anxiety, she is also sooo talented. ❤❤❤
it’s been a long time coming by….
Love this song so far since I first heard it
so underrated
The singer has an amazing voice!!🔥 TAYLOR SWIFT/i wish you the best🌼☁💙          🌹   LOVE YOU🎆
can we talk about how this is THE BEST song on midnights and it's so underrated
"Freedom felt like summer then" literally describes most of our teenage doesn't it.
0:36 yes
A bit difficult to calm mind down after a long gaming session.
Looks like your biggest audience yet! You now know how Taylor feels!
Imagina escuchar tu musica  juntos 🔥 nose te espero
Experienced this song while being in love, then experienced it heartbroken. It hit different both times.

This is 5025, anyone from Mars?❤❤❤
the mention of ken and the line: or have they come to take me away? really connect this storyline to ttpd. i wonder if this one of the songs about reunion with matty in the studio during midnights recording session
https://youtu.be/m6cYsbLr0iU?si=7sSU2ZsIgyvJ-xmf.... Don’t know if I’ll ever hear from you again...

One of the most criminally underrated vault tracks of all time. One of my fantasy football team names for the past 2 years has been "Hurts Different". This is the second year in a row I've run a Swiftie Fantasy Football league and I know they appreciate it haha. Going on year 3 this fall! Taylor you are more than welcome to join girlie! <3
The first tone just like the song name "the very first night" <3 OMG TS makes me feels so loveeeeeee!!!!
The way she says take me a Waaaaay is just why i love this ...... song   ŵwẃẅwwwweeeeeaaaayyyy so freeing for just a moment in time. Oh to be taylor swift but then its not my story to tell

Dear J, I know things haven't been well with us But times like this hits my epiphany and I've never felt so alive not unless I'm with you Every adventure and every story hits every fiber of my skin You hits different!

Argumentative, antithetical dream girl 💙

This reminds me  of Wilson/ Phillips, with the background harmonies.💙💛💙
Architects wish they could build bridges as well as Taylor ❤
i never thought i would feel represented by this song
this song literally hits different
very sigma
Like if you're here in 2025.
This is going to have the cruel summer renaissance one day
taylor swift isn't that bad after all
This song is helping to heal me. Thank you Taylor. You make me feel less alone. 🫶
This song sounds like it would be on 1989
This song hits different 🤭
This is my fave TS song ever. It stirs all my feelings
2025, we see you, baby.❤
2062, anyone?
This one's gotta be for joe. :( i love how i can relate to her lyrics and life. I've always thought love wasn't for me. And still hasn't come to me. It's lonely, but it's okay
underrated masterpiece

I love how every background in Taylor Swift's song is unique which shows her personality. Also, every words in all her songs.
Everyone is saying this is a song that would be during the credits on a 2000's movie or just a connecting song but this should be the centre of a whole movie ❤
💜💜
Whos here after she just played it x welcome to new york 😢😭
Funny how none of my favourites off this album are in the deluxe but not the main one
Just cant get enough of this song 😭😭
A song about break up sounds like a falling in love song
Is it your key in the door is it okay
my favourite song from Midnights

She called me a sweetheart   kisses

IT HITS DIFFRENT THIS THIS TIME
OH MY LOVE IS A LIE
This song really hits different
That’s our argumentative antithetical dream girl!!!
I am ten and a hardcore swiftie, and I say that this is my favourite song. It shows that being heartbroken can fun with some people, while it can be devastating with others

Trust me. I know what you're thinking. You are breaking up a bit because your friends don't listen to the same sounds that you do. It's all a bit rustic. Possibly agricultural. There are no continuities in your local library or supermarket or video store. You dissociate when school begins, then at lunch you have no box like your friends', and you have to smoke when you get older to keep different hungers, unusual cravings for movies, comics, novels, even parts of the neighbourhood that smell different to yours. Well there are other kids out there in this land like that, freer than you mostly maybe, but still isolated. Don't give up. Don't pretend that you can sense nothingness any better than anyone else.

Addiction to th8s song
Too much cussing
This sounds so 1989
0:23 years 😂
Don't go her don't leave me hanging at least friends for life. 💜
Fun fact, at the end of the last song on Midnights, (Hits Different), Taylor says “Or have they come to take me? To take me away!!!” At the beginning of Fortnight, she says “I was supposed to be sent away.. but they forgot to come and get me.” See the connection?
MY SONG AND MINE ONLY 💯
Emotional but  catchy, upbeat 🌚
The chorus of this is as infectious as a 1989 track. For some reason my favorite part is how she sings 'catastrophic blues'
Her mature voice makes this even better than it already was
i heard it in a mall and here i am ✨💅✨
Hidden gem at Midnights
When I was 4 I clicked on music videos ALOT yes the early 2010s was absolutely the VEVO Era of music videos, I came across the 22 music video and I liked that song so much, as Taylor was releasing 1989 and the shake it off video came out I realized that I’m becoming a swiftie a lot,  I was really into her songs and even my first concert had to be Taylor swift. I had no hope and got to experience the magic at the eras tour in LA (thanks to my sister who was working for metro lol) and it forever has a piece in my heart thanks Taylor for all this you gave me.
This is my favorite taylor swift song❤❤
Makes me think of a Cristy McVie song.
This song deserves more likes!❤❤❤❤
ive just realized that the song date is 5/26 and 5+2+6=13. wow
loveee
#taylorswift13 hi Taylor if you're trying to push me away again knock it off cuz you know I haven't been with anyone other than you as far as relationship wise or anything other So everybody needs to knock it off now I'm faithful to Taylor
Best song to dance to 🎉

Bet I could still melt your world! Argumentative antithetical dream girl My heart and my hips,  my body, my love (oh my love is a lie) Trying to find  a part of me that you didn’t touch my body, my love  Oh, my, love is a lie Shit my friends say to get me by 'Cause it's you Catastrophic blues Movin' on was always easy for me to do It hits different (yeah) Hits different 'cause it's you
MY SUMMER SONG IS HITS DIFFERENT I LOVE YOU TAYLORR
OOOO I SOOO VERY LIKE THIS SONG
This song is so underrated but amazing
Great RYTHM  great lyrics......🎉🎉🎉
OH MY LOVE IS A LIEEEEE  Best song no question
She’s cracking up because she can’t shake off Matty
"Moving on was always easy for me to do"  .....apparently she couldn't move on from this heartbreak......love u tay tay ❤
Hits different: *“Is it you or have they come to take me away?”* Fortnight: *“I was supposed to be sent away but they forget to come and get me”*
hits different, hits different
Regardless of who the song is about and I have no real clue. I promise from now on to be less mental if only... 'cause it's you 🫠 (im a poet dont u know it, too)
This is my favorite song that Taylor has ever made
the song "hits different" literally HITS DIFFERENT to listen to
Anyone here in 2024?😅
WE LOVE YOU TAYLOR!!💙
You're E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G 2 me, Mamselle Swift :))))....

UR ACTUALLY TO AMAZING TAY BEST SONG EVERRRRRRRR TRAVIS IS LUCKY TO HAVE  U, u Have made the world better with ur music and just u being on planet earth 💕
You're so gifted and your voice makes me😶‍🌫. You were great performing at '21 grammys, proves you can play live. I reckon Prince would've loved your recent albums 🌠
🛐🛐
Can’t stop singing!!🫶😊
pop perfection.
So Taylor Swift’s parents named her after the great recording artist James Taylor.  And wow!  She has really owned up to that name.  Her music is sublime, as she is already one of the greatest recording artists of all time.  Hebrews 11:6

"And what happened?"
Love this
OH MY LOVE IS A LIE 🗣
Bejuled taylor
Yea half the bands with me so you
I heard your key turn in the door down hallway Is that your key in the door? Is it okay? Is it you?  Or have they come to take me away?
"I was supposed to be sent away, but they forgot to come and get me"
Midnights: Is it you? Or have they come to take me away?   TTPD: I was supposed to be sent away but they forgot to come and get me
2:11
1:13 this part omg
I’m confused, the last lyrics in hits different are “hits different cause it’s you” 😭
The intro of 'So High School' (TTPD) is similar to the intro of this song, but slowed.
In 'hits different' it was 'Or have they come to take me away', and in 'fortnight' it was ''i was supposed to be sent away but they forgot to come and get me''
Watch me though!
Or they have come to take me away? But they forgot to come and get me (Fortnight)
'I find the *artifacts*, cried over a hat Cursed the space that I needed I trace the *evidence*, make it make some sense Why the wound is still bleeding'  'You were the one that I loved, Don't need another metaphor It's simple enough'  It hits different this time.
knowing from the start that midnights was a breakup album does not make ttpd hurt less i am in shambles
1:31 TTPD
First song that came to mind after seeing the TTPD Timetable vid. anyone else??
This sounds like it needs to be in a movie
There are some parts of the song that sounds like "The very first night" ❤️
un TEMAZOOOO te amo Taylor❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
if you were a mastermind you would have read the bus time table & wouldn't have had to walk home....just sayen....lol....

THE MOST underrated song on Midnight , no actualy THE MOST underrated song TAYLOR HAD EVER MADE
I know it's supposed to be a love/heartbreak song but it reminds me of my friend from highschool, leaving for uni to different cities is hard, and every hang out after felt so special ❤️
its sounds like the very first night
to take me AWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
Who else thinks this song is so underrated??
https://youtu.be/C-z-IckrQK8?feature=shared  @taylorswift13 am I still a disappointment to the crowd to  Your inner circle , your family and friends... Are you going to continue to choose their choice for you and I ?? Don't go Taylor
que música boa serio
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings, so metaphoric

It’s nice knowing she goes through what we do.
I hope TPD is this

You Have Changed My Life ❤❤
11 -  01 - 2024❤ taylor❤
this is peak youtube summer song....alisha marie, bethany mota, aspyn ovard, owl necklaces, bath and body works, driving around with your friends, somehow so nostalgic. Takes me to early 2010s🥰🌴🍹💖💛💚
...dreams...
I hope I never get this feeling and this song for myself, cause it hits different.
“The sand hurts my feelings” is so Anakin Skywalker
Hits different hits different
Moving on was always easy for me to do...

I am the one for you my queen B luv U.S. both of us Will do for ever and ever  ❤ is true Loves You
I can't help listening to this song. I am addicted.
Im sorry but why in the world would Taylor pick the best song on the album to be a target only exclusive? Didnt she do the same thing years ago with New Romantics? Her team needs to do better helping her with these decisons
IM ASCENDING
best song shes ever made
💔
Great Song, I love it ❤️✨
Hits Different >> You're Losing Me
How do you do it, cinnamon agave nectar?
She's the main character, it's her.
I realy like this song
Another Bridge To Scream Out Loud !!!!
To take me Awayyyyyyyyyyy !!!!
I love how upbeat this song is but if you're listening to the lyrics it's her crying about a breakup. 😍 😍😍😍
This song is like a hidden gem stone.
❤❤
Music industry
Hits different no recibe el reconocimiento q merece
You are so amazing,I hope you are happy. You are my celebrity crush.I guess that’s a thing. I am a huge fan of your work and I love your music. I’m older than you so that seems weird to me that I am infatuated by you.Your voice calms me down when I hear your music,so thankful for you and what you’ve done and accomplishments. I love that your so caring for others and independent strong woman for knowing what you want and 3:5 doing what you want and never giving up on yourself fighting for what’s right. I hope you continue to be successful in your life 7:33 November 20 Kelsey is a lucky man i

I miss Joe lol, I think I miss him more than Taylor does.
Then threw up in the street! LOL I love that lyric!
Hits different this time……
Literally, figuratively, & Exactly As It’s Written And Read… Sweeter Than Fiction.
I can't be the only one that rejoices whenever I notice her subscribers' number has grown!
6666th comment
This is definitely one of the most underrated songs in Midnights
The vid is 3:55 min long. If u add it up, its 13, Taylor's fav number!
This should be deleted
I hope your losing me will be release plsssss
A masterpiece ❤
Well ❤️‍🩹 what about the 🏈 game
1:44
I this one too
İs it ''oh my,love is a lie'' Or is it ''oh my love is a lie'' ?
00:52 - 00:59
She's a genius lyricist but the simplicity of "you were the one that I loved; don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough" really messes me up. One of the best songs in Midnights
I can't stop listening to this song. Even though the melody is very moving, the lyrics are very emotional.😭💙💙
Linda maravilhosa
https://youtu.be/a2puxqEbg5Y ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So relatable
🎉
Is it just me or nah but Hits Different is to Midnights as Cornelia Street is to Lover. I just feel like HD is the sequel of CS.
Quelques chansons si je les aime, mais la plupart n’ont pas aimé. Je pense qu’elle n’est pas une mauvaise chanteuse mais elle n’est pas à mon goût.
MASTERPIECE
AMEN AMEN  que   Dieu  tout puissant vous bénisse
This song + cardigan hits different Ngl 🫶🏻
😂🎉
My sadness is contagious ❤
Taylor started putting her music out by knocking on doors and handing her music to people in Nashville T. With her mom driving her around and putting it out there. Eventually look where she is now. Yeah Taylor. What a awesome human being.
loveee
THIS ONLY CAME OUT 4 MONTHS AGO?????
Beautiful
petition for uploading You're Losing Me in youtube!
joe is taylor's love of her life.. it really Hits her real bad...she said..its simple enough...he is the one she love..
The song actually hits different
love this one <3
the rhythm: :D the lyrics: :'''[
give me “ur losing me” i want a heart break
"Midnights" is the first album of her's I really liked and bought - but I'm going to buy her next release which is 1989.
Taylor Swift's music always hits different! 🎶❤️ Can't get enough of her incredible talent and catchy tunes.
*This makes me wannabe in a breakup??* 😭
This  one of her most underrated masterpieces ever !!
Her best song ever.
i love ts
MI CANCIÓN FAVORITA EN TODO EL MUNDO
6.7M
Essa música era pra estar na edição padrão, e era pra ser single (com direito a videoclipe e tudo).
im in love with this song
I can feel my heartache when I listen to this song even, but it’s also very catchy.   When I first heard this song, I thought she said oh my love is alive, and hits different meant staying together and just going through the messy together.  It made me think of my relationship with my partner.
I FREAKING LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!!!!!💕💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💕💕💕❤️❤️❤️🥺😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰😘😘😇😇😇
can I just say that this hits different?
De las mejores canciones de Midnights ❤. Este album es increíble
❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹Taylor
this song hits different
love the dreamy pop sound omfg
"Hits Different" is "New Romantics" depressive sister
I can not be the only one who thinks Hits Different sounds similar to august
I remember when HITS DIFFERENT wasn't released yet, those were the days of memorizing it from leaks. Hahaha. 😩💜
Ship it ❤❤❤
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
She's just too talented it's insane. I love you Taylor ❤
⚠ATTENTION SWIFTIES⚠ We are going to give Taylor the best birthday present!! At December the 13th we will stream all the Taylor's version albums as much as we can. We can then try to make all of them in the top 10 streams. that's it for now!! PLEASE pass this on for our fav TayTay!!!!
I can't unhear the superbook theme song huhuhu😭
Taylor for ever
❤❤❤❤
Amazing song Taylor
Taylor Swift's latest hit 'Hits Different' is an absolute banger! Her talent knows no bounds. 🔥🎶 #SwiftiesForever

Only you are my really love Taylor my love!!!💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
idc what anyone says this is easily one of my favs from midnights
Taylor Swift's latest hit 'Hits Different' is an absolute banger! Her talent knows no bounds!
best song of midnights (after maroon)
Mike, what's your religion?  Faith
Chick in the store, probably mid twenties. I just always get a kick out of this when it happens. I let them know something wasn't told to them about an inventory inquiry. Chick acted kinda snooty as if trying to steal a sale even though clearly not dressed for the part.  Just overheard she works for a Christian Radio Station  Christians 😂
That's a funny photo, Holy Moses I have an idea! 😂
Does anyone else here think this song “hits different”? 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
I thought it was “oh my love is alive” thinking it was a bopping love song…until I realized it’s “love is a lie” and it’s a breakup song😅🙃
or have they come to take me away TAKE ME AWAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY
The only time I've been disappointed in a Taylor Swift production. My Midnights (3 am edition) doesn't include a LOT of songs. Sorry, can't afford to buy several productions to get all the songs. Seems this was the entire album production, gotta buy them all to get all the songs. Taylor has never disappointed me before - now I am.
“you were the one that I loved. don’t need another metaphor, it’s simple enough.”
Te amoooo❤
Let me not cry omg🥺
Belong to 1989🫶🙏
oooooooh myyyyy love is a lieeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Yes Taylor
My fav midnights song
3:13 this is for me I love this part 💕
3:09 part is so sad 😔
I love this woman 🤤🥰🎶💃🏻🕺🏻💃🏻🕺🏻
I love this
another song that sounds happy but is actually tragic <3
She's a genius.  Can we all just agree on that finally.
Taylor Swift you are number one 🤩🌟⭐✨💥❤️👍
Kaylorrr
I love this song 💌
https://youtu.be/H8J83LXox-k
A lot of pirated .mp3 files will be deleted today👀
More of this Taylor
Can aaron dessner produce or at least participate in producing all of her songs🥺🥺🥺 idk but he really manages to bring out her voice
Dreaming philly.
i love this song
Taylor Swift.....
Lie? Hmm
that "catastrophic blue".... Blue is Joe's color 😭😭😭
Taylor is so talented and my dream is to see her Eras tour in person 🤞❤️
If kaylor lore is true.. and evidence points yes.. no wonder she is still singing about this. I think maybe karlie was just a bit of a loud mouth dummy and accidentally ruined Taylor’s life. That’s some hard facts to deal with. Taylor’s version for the win!
My lovely gf listen to Taylor's song almost everyday and now im hooked to her song too
When she says “my sadness it contagious”, it’s 100% true! If she’s sad she makes us sad❤❤❤
Surprise songs also hit different when you know you’re gonna get tickets 🥺
best song on midnights
Omg this is like my favorite song now!  Taylor, ily so much! Keep going! ❤ 💜💙🩷
"moving on was always easy for me to do it hits different, coz it's you"  literally written for me 😢 to the man I love, thank you for everything. we're both hurting now, i pray for both our healing.
✨TAYLOR SWIFT!!💜💙❤️________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Slayed in every way possible
What did u do to our girl Joseph Alwyn ??
J mane won't be happy with this do ya homework on j mane it hits different when u don't know who j mane is but u know it hits different
Taylor, I think I'm all right now.....🤫
This is beautiful, it’s like she’s merged ‘august’ and ‘peace’ together. Beautiful melody:)
This really hits different😭💘
klo denger lagu mba taylor selalu happy <3
Such a fan
🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌🌌
Love this song. So melodious. TS, you are such super amazing and great talented song-writer
Obsessed with this song
literally my favorite song from a different album than Red.
best bridge in midnights
She is my past, she is my present and she is my future.
3:10
taylor, this song hits different CUZ IT'S YOU !
Is it should my should freinds say to get me by or shit my friend say to get me by
l'm crazy with Taylor's Songs 😭💗 they're just magical ✨🫂 BHAG HUG heme LeBron
Hey it's the melody that Calvin Harris sampled in This Is What You Came For! Glad to see Taylor taking rightful ownership of it, since that's her voice in the sample anyway.
“Now the sun burns my heart” She used to describe Karlie as the 🌞 emoji “I slur your name until someone puts me in a car” (Kar slur for Karlie) This is definitely about Karlie Kloss!!
"Catastrophic blues Movin' on was always easy for me to do It hits different It hits different 'cause it's you"
"Catastrophic blues Movin' on was always easy for me to do It hits different It hits different 'cause it's you"
Imagine being so talented that you can just add a song like this on the end of a deluxe version of your album and not have it as a lead single. INSANE!!
One of my favs of Midnights
Love is of course a lie it’s just life that old lie, love it or don’t it’s just fair like that.
Is there a film clip ? I must watch the film clip
Sadness is contagious
entrada para mis 15✌
Catastrophic blues!🥺 Well i'ts okay😉 I love this song and of course to my Gorgeous Taylor Swift!❤
2:12 - 2:47 🤍🤍🤍
This song is sooo beautiful, literally everythingg
This song reminds me of summer 💗
2:10
I need the mv for this song 😍
Hits Different Cause Its YOU!!!!
Where is the lyrics ? Must have hits different too. 😊
Not the background giving off Lavender Haze😢 This song hits different for sure. The part of them coming to take her away makes me so sad😢 I really hope she's okay❤
Pls the speech
girl kisser
Taylor, ¿What happened to "you're losing me"?
Listening to this after Call It What You Want hits different 😭💔
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Love  how these lyrics convey the sadness of realising that you have outgrown things that used to work for you - 'freedom felt like summer then, on the coast, now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings'. We all love to tell ourselves we are a free spirit and dont need anyone when we are younger, but it changes.
Te amo reina ❤
Her echoed “hits different” at 3:20 breaks my heart every time 🥺
next year im on her concert in hamburg or zurich, im so excited
Just listening to this otw to my school makes me feel better. ❤
this song hits different !!!
❤❤❤❤
I can’t be the only one that gets a major Ross and Rachel break up vibe from this song. Knowing Taylor is a huge Friends fan makes me wonder 🫠🫶🏻
Man why does she have so many relatable songs
3:32 - 3:55 is so heavenly❤
1 OR 2 TOPICS TRENDING AT A TIME.  5 TO 8 HOURS PER TOPIC.  Everyone on earth is always similar👍🏼
y'know the most theories i hear about this being the beginning of a break up album the more im convinced this album is just venting everything past and present
Taylor let you experience all the heart aches, happiness, joy ,sad and a lot more just by listening to all of her songs. Though, I did'nt experience all in real life , I can always relate😅 to ever songs 💕
Finally it's here ✨
labyu
Kanye made Taylor
My surprise song :)
Hits different for sure.... 😢💔 does anyone else get a hint of August vibes btw or just me?
Speak now is just here
Queen
Taylor Swift is just the artist that always just ✨hits different✨    Thank you for another masterpiece Tay ❤❤
If everyone were a problem like you, the problems in the world would be of a completely different order and people would despair only because of a lack of inspiration.
Paging Bob Dylan
This song is so underrated
1:21 now the SUN burns my heart the SAND hurts my feelings  Sun- Daylight  Sand- Snow on the beach  Both songs about joe 🥺💝💔
Hey Lillith
Taylor swift I am so excited for  speak now (Taylors version)
This is what I am looking for from MY radio. I always follow up your new hits songs since high school. ❤
idk man this hits different
“I hate him so I just asked if he could go” oh…
Joe Alwyn is gone too 🤭
moommy please  save  me
🌹❤️💋 I love you.🖤🏴‍☠️🖤🙃😁☂️
im trying to figure out what the hype is about but i really cant she doesn't sing that much i mean its just talking with music in the background and i cant really vibe or relate with the lyrics that much
💜🫶🏻✨
I wish I could like this song again 🥲
You are so beautiful and your music is great I wish I got to go to a concert of yours it will probably never happen but I hope it does I love you and your music you go girl love ya
Jejak
Something about the likelihood that “their song” playing at the club is another Taylor Swift sign just makes this song…. Hit different
I LOVE THIS SONG
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VqFApxJrYR0

"you are the one that I love" 😭💅 my fav part.
The Very First Night <3
DONDA🕊️
Scared she's going to try and make 13 stick even if it's not right
the melody is so fun, even … goofy? but the lyrics are gut wrenching damn
how did this not make the first version of midnights?
I love this song! Feels similar to 1989 and more specifically New Romantics
Can't stop coming back to this!! This is a literal masterpiece. I want my album to sound like this!!!!!
How many Midnights is she releasing
i was skeptical about her at the very begin.. i was so wrong !! love your songs Taylor !!
❤
3:09
Hits different. Indeed (":
ang galing
T amo Taylor 😭❤️‍🩹
How have i not heard this before 😭🙈
This song hits different.
Midnight is honestly one of my favorite albums by Taylor. All of the feelings and lines she adds are so raw and beautiful. This is the most authentic I feel we've ever seen Taylor within an album.
LSS
I love her ❤
Yo sabía que el era diferente❤
It kind of has a beat mixed between the very first night and 1989 vibes, and it literally.. Hits Different
taylor nunca decepciona 😞💓
This song really does hit different...
🎶❤️‍🔥🎶❤️‍🔥🎶❤️‍🔥
I love this i love you TS ❤
Mejor cantantes de Voice Chile. Saldría eliminada ...

That's Deeply felt pain...👑🔥🔥🔥
This breaks my heart. ❤
recommended this song to a guy I like, but he replied that I must’ve already offered this song to someone, without knowing that it’s really meant for him.
Listened to this probably 30 times alone today. It just hits different.
OH MY LOVE IS A LIE
TO TAKE ME AWAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYY
Omg
Taylor swift. If you see this comment could you make a beautiful eyes Taylor’s version. Could be in the debut. I just want to listen to those songs without spend much.
Hits different
TO TAKE ME AWAYYYY
is it okay?
#taylorswift
Am i the only one who act dramatic on chorus part
Somehow, she's just getting more talented as the years go by ❤ I love this song.
Does anyone know when/if You’re Losing Me will be released as a single?  I love Taylor, but cannot afford to buy another digital album of Midnights for just this song.  I have purchased Midnights three times already to get new material.  I really hope she will consider those of us on a fixed income (yeah, I’m old) and release it as a single soon.
"Like an a$$hole outlaw"  💯💯💯😁😁
ME???IN LOVE WITH THIS SONG
Preciosa canción ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh my, love is a lie
💙💙💙💙💙
Again! Taylor Swift never disappoints us; the older she gets, the finer her music becomes. Her music is a balm for my soul, soothing the aches and pains of my heart with each note and lyric. In moments of despair and anguish, her melodies lift me up and carry me to a place of hope and healing. Indeed, Taylor is my sanctuary when I am lost in the shadows of my mind.
I adore this song!!! It hits diffrent while driving a car!
ok but this song hits different💗🫶🏻 also btw, the concert was the BEST!
GAPO yg KITA like nor nor not like diajelous kor

Life’s too short to pretend that you don’t like Taylor Swift
I love you taylor

Taylor is such an inspiration to me. So much that I've been writing my own songs and wanting to be a singer. (No one cares probably but i just wanted to say that) This is a jam. I love this song.

This song hits different cuz its written and sung by you <3
I like to listen to her songs repeatedly and look at the lyrics just to find out the meaning and the story behind her song.
Okay I’m confused the lyrics are so sad but then the tune is so happy and a bop and I’m like do I add this to my in my bag playlist or as a workout song
Like where was this song on the original release 😭
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
When you realise Hits different  is actually a break up song
The bridge 🔥
Luv this song, especially the chorus and the "just take me away" lyric!!! Can't believe we won by getting this on streaming platforms!!! ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊

♥️🤗
Hits different to me
I love you Taylor swift!!!!!
Can we just appreciate how much effort Taylor swift puts into her songs they all sound like magic in my ears
2:29 is addictive
She had me at "Each bar plays our song, nothing has ever felt so wrong" 🥺
The juxtaposition of the heartbroken lyrics with the more upbeat track makes me love this song so freaking much
TE AMO TAYYYYLORRRRRRR
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings. And I never don't cry at the bar.
It hits different 'cause it's you ('Cause it's you) ... I miss you 🥺💔
Hits different need a MV!
oh man, this is one of her best songs ever.. that "or have they come to take me AWAY" cut right through to my soul
Hits different hits different
Need “argumentative antithetical dream girl” on a shirt ASAP
Having heard this live in Chicago just tonight was magical. THANK YOU!
The girl of my dreams rises from the soul, and sways, never failing one masterpiece after another!!! Thanks for the music Taylor, I love your divine work of art!!!

The love of my life sent me this song
U took all there money didnt u babe
FINALLY!!! HOORAY 💜💜💙💙
sad girl version on this song please TAYLOR!
너는 그만 잊혀저서 the lakes 처럼 될 필요가 있다. 최근의 빌보드에 랭크된것은 자본들의 살기위한 억지이다. 가가가 너보다 노력하지 않았을까 김윤아 봄날은 간다.
Que bueno que vengas a Argentina a compartir la buena música que haces
hits diffrent
Lo ve you!!!!
This reminds me of Friends
Was Your Losing Me a leak?
😊

I'm gonna listen to this song to remind me I promised my son I'd quit smoking  after this pack
Best song ever
♥️♥️♥️
TA INCRÍVEL 😭😭😭
As a thrifty Swifty, I don't usually get to listen to her new songs when they are dropped. But I love to hear her voice and her messages.  I'm so happy and thankful for this beautiful Lady. She's helped so many people with her songs. She proves time and time again that you don't have to use bad language to make hits. A true artist.
just imagine seeing Taylor in real totally insanee
If it is true, if it is Emma, OMG I can't forgive him
Huge fan! Wish I could see you live and in person!🤍 You have always been someone that I have looked up too. Im so proud and happy for you Tay!
Hits different...
Abi ko ndi na mabalik ni🥹🫶

@taylorswift #TaylorAllisonSwiftMcDonalds is this what its like because you know that we can talk

LSS☕
this is like the best song i can listen to it 10000000000000000 times a day
👍👏❤so melodious voice, mature writing and attractive appearance in a pretty and generous looking person, the Taylor swift. Blessings and lots of love to you 🙏🏼😍❤🙋‍♂️
To take me away omg
Finally! It's officially on YouTube 😍💜☺️
IT HITS DIFFERENT CAUSE IT’S U
❤❤❤❤
I once said Taylor is my "favorite" artist, but not because of the great music, her fame, or all the awards she has won. She is one of the very few people I know who shows she cares about other people and has taken action and not simply made public statements. I don’t know where she is currently at or if the rumors are true, but I hope she remembers that her worth goes beyond what people think of her and who she is with or not (in a relationship). Taylor, wherever you are, I hope you are well.💛
Awesome 🎵 🎶
Feels like a mix of "22" and 1989.
Bye Thailand
OBRIGADA, MÃE❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hello there! For sure you get thousands of messages a day... and this will be one more... My daughter will turn to 13y.o. in July 8th and her party will be "Taylor Swift Theme". Please, could you send some message for her? Some kind of Happy birthday? I will be really thanks!
I LOVE TAYLOR SWIFT
you are a queen
❤❤❤
I am a  swiftie  I wish I could get tickets but no😢😢😢
man, this hits different after taylor-joe break up :/
I never got to buy the physical cd so its my first listen. I have the vinyl.
I love you Taylor Swith
She should drop this as a single, with a video and Radio promo - it would be a top 3 hit for sure, or even number 1, considering Taylor's huge fan base and appeal.
Finally ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Taylor my babe what a song ❤
This song should’ve been on barbie soundtrack
This really hits different
It actually hits different ❤
hermoso
https://youtu.be/1qvuKn1IsI8
The beginning reminds me of "The very first night"
This song fits my life so much. My ex bf has no intention to propose even though we're 7th year together. I can't waste anymore time. Idc i have to leave
This sounds like a 1989 song
THIS SONG REALLY SUITS ON BARBIE !!!!!
Can you even imagine being at the bar with Taylor Swift and she's crying. What do you even do? Probably doesn't trust anybody but her mom.  Girl, I'm so sorry. All the hugs 🫂
Taylor Swift ft. Ice Spice - Karma (Slowed & Reverb) Lyrics Edit #music #remix #trend https://youtu.be/SCB1pQGJhAQ
❤
Why does this song sound better with 1.2x playback speed? 🤷🏻‍♀️
💖💖💖
Idk, but the way she says “Ohhhh myyyy love is a liiie” and “easy for me to dooo” it just hits different 😉 (I’ll cringe later 🤪🫣)
Sounds more like RED
Whenever I listen to Taylor's songs, I feel like Shakespeare is just around the corner with a different version of himself.
In love with this song❤
Woke up and found yet another new fav Taylor Swift song 😍😍
Aah finally 🎉🎉🎉
❤❤❤❤
Awesome 😊
Everything she makes me feel alive ❤️‍🔥
melodically speaking, this feels like taylor from her pre-debut era. im still thinking of that specific song of hers before but it sounds so nostalgic ❤
Oh Padme
Bet I could still melt your world argumentative, antithetical, dream girl huh? 🧐🧐🧐🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈🏳‍🌈
❤❤❤❤beautiful....
This hits different iykyk
Y'all want this song, now is finally legal y'all dont streaming a lot. K bye
Cultural appropriation
how come ive already heard this?
Xfa sube You re losing me
Tamo bb
Taylor knows!🥹🙌🏼💜✨
U always sing very well I use to listen your song day and night 🌃 keep it up girl 🙏🙏🙏
I remember when I had stopped by every where along my route, to send my baby a text, but one day I sent her a picture of a slice of Pizza, she remembers the exact date and time. LoL, sent me surprise text of same thing, but I had forgotten about it. I was just telling her I was fine.      Only till I remembered the event did I get it.      But she is everything I am not. 'So it hits Different, because it's her.       Just like Me. Those little things became big things, because I gave her everything, I only had her, till this day.
This song is on repeat!!!!! I’m just blown away by how alive this song makes me feel! ❤
I celebrate our love.
Can't stop thinking about my love, 😢
2:21- 2:30 hits different
Big fan
Hits Different has a sound like it’s from early 2000s alt pop rock group and I’m loving it.
I think this was my favorite song on Midnights but then you dropped "You're Losing Me" so now I don't know! But I truly think I would benefit from therapy after the new one...
OH I remember how we were dying to get this one released, a few days ago haha💗💗💗
Aña
I'm so hooked with this now !!!!
this is so nostalgic
❤❤
Привет
this is such a singer-songwriter soundtrack for a romcom I LOVE IT
What other tay song is this reminding me of…? 🤔
anyone feel that this song has some melodic similarities with The Very First Night? no? only me? hahaha
These days I just keep imagining how it's gonna be if Taylor writes books. It thrilled me, though
❤
GAME OVER
1989 : Out of the woods Rep : Getaway car Lover : Cruel summer Folklore : August Evermore : 'tis the damn season Midnights :  Hits different
I wanna meet u TAYLOR!!!
damn #13 on trending
A NEW SONG🔥
this is my main character background music. 💃💃
DONT SAY YES RUNAWAY NOW
very beautiful.   U.
anyone got chicago tickets for sale?
This song HITS DIFFERENT
a hint of Red in a Lavender Haze of catastrophic blue.
There's something so nostalgic about this song. Is it the chord progression? Sounds like it could be an old 3rd Eye Blind track
Taylor's songs hits different!! ❤
Sun- Daylight?  Sand- Snow at the beach? 😧
I used to listen to Taylor's songs with my boyfriend who broke up with me a week ago. Its so sad that now i can't send him new taylor songs. He loved hits different
the whole song  especially the choruses and bridge have the vibe of early 2000s , y'all will never get me 🥲
It's what you believe in
Wasn't this released before?
This song hits different with earpods on💜 Ps.Thank me later 😘
te amo
Am I the only one hearing "The very first night"
It’s my new fav
this would've made a great encore song during the eras tour instead of karma.
I want  meet to Taylor Swift so bad
This song is a masterpiece. Taylor’s voice has grown so much!
This sounds like a fall morning. It sounds like car windows down on a road trip. It sounds like a transition song between Red & 1989, it's got those vibes. I love it. One of my more favorite Taylor songs.
Yengenize beğeni atmayı unutmayın?!
This is amazing guuuysssss........
😮
This song really hit different....who agrees with me 🙂👍🏻
I really want this to be in the album 🥲🥲
Increíble lo que hace esta mujer ❤
Finnallyyy FINALLLLYYYY.........after all those  years of illegally listening to it😭
Her music always gives me nostalgia
This songs gives me so much of Red vibes!!!! 😭😭😭
FINALMENTEEEEEEEE
FYB J Mane,
Am I the only one who feels like hits different kind of shows that Taylor knew she was going to break up to Joe for a while but kept trying to be in denial about it. This song after you're losing me sounds more like realizing you are going through a tough break up that is none like any other instead of a love song.
Oh my love is a lie 💔 temazo ❤
mommy you are way too underrated
How could you be so amazing for all this time! From my junior high school and now I am in my graduate study, your songs have always been giving me inspiration. Love you soooooo much! And plz plz try to host your tour in China QAQ
❤❤❤
I can't stop listening to it cuz it just Hits Different
Tay te amo literalmente siento que nuestras emociones estan sincronisadas 😭😭😭
Finally! Us international peeps have been WAITING!!!!  Need next please!
I’m crazy with Taylor’s songs 😭💗 they’re just magical ✨.
Banger 👏 as always
Hits Different is the reality Cornelia Street was scared of 🥺
It Hits Different talaga mhiee ❤️❤️
I love you tay💗😭
This Song is So Great~!!!!!
This song is one of the best, 💜💜 I purchased the Lavender Cd Edition from Target and this was the bonus track, I was wondering when she would release it officially!! So excited

mi mandíbula cayó
I'm in my thirties and just love the nostalgic 90s / early 2000s vibes of this track.

Taylor Swift - Hits Different  The title speaks for itself ♥

i don’t know how to explain it but the bridge and then the chorus i want to scream out the lyrics and cry at the same time, this song feels different now with her a joe breaking up
this should be on the barbie movie!
Is this about Joe A?
❤
It feels like a Red song
this song hits different.
Nice Singing
te amo
❤❤❤
YO AMO DEMASIADO HITS DIFFERENT
What about this song in the new Barbie movie? She literally mentions Kens here...
TO TAKE ME AWAYYYYYYY
1:56 amongus

Big thanks to our queen for releasing this official song!
I need “you’re losing me” Please, mom
Te amooooo
Not me who’s been pirating this song through Spotify👀
Te amo
She thinks she’s her (she is her)
Absolutely love .
right from the beginning I'm getting country Taylor with the guitar....... I LOVE THIS
I'm only a fan of her and yet her breakup with joe literally shattered me
Te amo taylor 😭
We need an official lyric video for this song
ಥ⁠‿⁠ಥ
Okay, is it just me or does anyone else also need a Taylor Swift Midnights: through the night cd of vinyl version. One with all the songs of this era.💙💙😻
Antithetical dream girl ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
YEAH THAT S HITS DIFFERENT
I’M OBSESSED! I think we can all agree that this song………Hits Different
kyna elferda taylor ji lmghrib mrhba bk
I was really hoping this would be a surprise single like "New Romantics" was for 1989. "Hits Different" is arguably her best song from Midnights.
Now the blues are catastrophic. I love this song but also i don't want her to write these songs. I want her to be happy. So much pain to have written these lines.
Não consigo parar de ouvir😍🇧🇷
2:31 sounds like a part of mastermind
🤍🤍🤍
I love these song.
Finally we can stream it ❤
Bu şarkı neden bu kadar tatlı
Very special😊❤🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺
Currently on the road listening to this song over and over again!
Amazing
Finally !
SUCH A GREAT SONG!!! new romantics vibes
This song is truly AMAZING.❤
WE WON
Waiting patiently for the song she recorded with the 1975 to come from the vault… 👀🙏🏽😭
1M 🎉🥳
GLORY DAYS
POV :when Taylor makes a song with the title of what you feel...when u hear her songs💜💜
Omgg😭😭
Tay please release you’re losing me pleaseeeww
The lyrics are soo real,raw,depressive,and funny😂 at the same time  Taylor is the best singer,songwriter,storyteller at the same time❤❤
Listen to this is bad for my mental health but that won't stop me 🗿🔥
I'm obsessed.
hi mom
2:50
I thought you didn't release this because i have this track on my unreleased playlist but now you drop this and i listen to it and i feel hits different
Hits different this time 🥰🥰🥰
It sounds like a lot of longing was bottled up...♥️♥️😍😍
"they say that if it's right, you know" is an idea/theme lana del rey touches on a few times in her recent album; specifically she and jack antonoff sing about it in their song "margaret." they sing, "when you know, you know" and it feels like taylor here is sort of referring to that?? as a fan of all three artists, the crossover is just so wonderful and haunting
Look at the title "Hits different" This song really hits differently
it gives 1989 🥺🥺🫶🏻
F. I. N. A. L. L. Y!!!
fruity af 🍓🍒🍎🍉
Taylor Swift & Shavesh ❤ , #taylorswift #shavesh #Shavesh #TaylorSwift #taylor.swift #taylor_swift #taylor-swift #shavesh_taylor_swift

I wish I'd grown up with Taylor Swift.  Her music has shaped my 50s and enriched my life.  I'd probably be the oldest person at a concert but I really hope that I can see her live before I age off the planet.

THE TRACK LIST ON TIL DAWN EDITION HAS ME SO EXCITED
THANK YOU FOR RELEASING THIS!!!!!!!!
❤  no words
who Need more folklore like me .
Not loving this one. Doesn’t fit the vibe of Midnights, which is probably why it didn’t make the initial cut. It’s a fine TS song, but calls back more heavily to earlier Taylor eras. this one didn’t connect with me. Oh well.   Glad about the new Lana version however!
Yeah this song hits different ✨✌️
te amo reina 🫶🏻🫶🏻
WHY TAYLOR DIDNT PUT THIS SONG ON THE ALBUM
Can someone explain to me the differences between midnights, 3am and the til dawn  editions ?
Doesn’t this song sound so much like the Old Taylor era? I mean, it is an instantaneous classic! 🤩👏🏼👏🏼
Finally

thanks taylor 😭🫶🏻
IS SHE FOR REAL?
Hits different hits different 🛐🛐
There is a lyric in ‘Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve’; ‘Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first’. You did that for me Taylor, you gave me back my girlhood.  I loved you’re music when I was a preteen but in 2018 I basically gaslight myself into thinking that I had to grow out of it because it was “cringy pop”. And so I did, for nearly 4 years. But in late spring 2022, during a laps in my mental health and in a desperate attempt to reconnect with my inner child, I began listening to you again, and I’m so thankful I did. I revisited all my old favourites of you’re songs, but I also discovered all you had done while I was gone, such as ‘Folklore’ ‘Evermore’ and recently ‘Lover’. ‘Folklore’ specifically deeply touched me, it was as though you grew and changed the same way I did in those 4 years. Coming back to you’re discography and listening to it all has been an incredibly joyful and healing process for me. Thank you. Thank you so much for welcoming me back so kindly. All you’re songs hit different now. 🫶💙
SHEESH
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Te amo mucho taylor. Me revivió esta canción.

This actually enter in my top 15 of bridges is so WOW❤
This song ‘hits different’ after knowing what happened (if you know, you know, you know)…it’s like blondie predicted her own future.💔   Edit: The “dream girl” is set up as the antithesis of the “main guy,” which suggests that the relationship may have had some conflict or tension. Although argumentative and antithetical have negative connotations, these traits brought out something that romantically interested and challenged the “main guy.” - Genius
I ZM CRYING
😍😍😍😍😍😍
Hi

This is such an amazing song. Taylor is such an amazing story teller. When I hear this song, it instantly takes me away from my World and into a different World. The World of a perfect story told by a perfect story teller. Thanks, Taylor for letting the rest of the World hear this gem of a song.

wait is this about Matty? If so, the lyrics, “moving on was always easy for me to do” would make sense as well as the release of this song online instead of just the target cd.
TAYLOR COME TO ARGENTINA
Not me buying the exclusive cd at target burning it on to my phone and thinking I was special to have these songs and then she releases them on this and now I’m vibing to this song even more then I ever did lol.
I HAVE TO LITSEN TO THIS EVERY DAY FROM NOW ONE 🩷

There should not be much of a delay between the two. If so, something hinky could be going on with you're ballot count and the election office should be contacted straight away...

I used to listen to this song with my boyfriend everyday on discord and every time we go out for a drive. I dedicated all of Taylor's love songs for him, Hits Different too, he loved this song, he even memorized the lyrics and used to sing along with me.  He broke up with me 5 days ago, and now that I listen to this, it just hurts so much.
THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS UP FOR STREAMING 🫶🏼
