Why you’re building these massive buildings on hardcore. That’s mean when you make a mistake and die you will lose everything 😢

(EVIL GIGGLE).EXE
1:29
Ayoo I got rickrooled 2 today please like
Why u Rick role us
friendly reminder that no matter how hard you make your minecraft lag your computer CANNOT not "melt" due to RAM limitations coded within the java launcher itself explode all the tnt you want
Who has this much time??? 😂😂
Now do it again with the tnt mod 😉
Bro predicted 67
1:59 SKZ MODE ACTIVATED
You are the living calculator of live  wunba.
Rick roll seriously 😂😂😂😂
Why u Rick rolled us 😂 9:59
Why did you Rick roll us? 44:31
Bro at  least you have your money me asking my mom to buy me a PC just know black belt 😅
I want to join your discord server 😊😊
46:01 but did you die
if anyone wants to know what hey says at 10:15 he says never gonna give you up
Can you come in to my world I am crabby raptor 202 that’s my software account I need a TNT flying machine
I subbed a day or two ago. You genuinely make me want to play this game again after almost 7 years of a hiatus. TY
W video
45:05 No. No you did not. You made a 1.95 Megaton bomb, and that's weaker than the 3 Megaton RDS-37, 9 Megaton B53, 10.5 Megaton Ivy Mike, 15 Megaton Castle Bravo, 24.2 Megaton Test 219, and 50 Megaton Tsar Bomba. There are nukes literally over ten times as big as your TNT Cube. 😂
Who else noticed at 10:10 the never gonna give you up
ik this video is a year old but please upload your world to cloud storage so you don't lose it 😭
at least your PC was fixed
0:46 JASON Voorhees?.?
That's editing right there 27:10
No overture 1812 was used, what a waste. Still absolute genius
Bro has 48 hours a day to play Minecraft💀
You did not need a 45 minute video for this. You could have simply made a short of time lapse...
“Or can you?”  Wunba has had his Vsauce moment
Fire song
37:39 Kermit???
44:06 did i just get rick rolled?
So no footage of after the explosion? What was the fucking point of watching then. Hate idiots who waste others time smh
the level  on unemployment  is crazy, but great video tho
10:02 Bro rickrolled us all 😭
I keep coming back here. This video never fails to send chills down my spine. Quoting Oppenheimer. "I am become death. The destroyer of worlds". A scientifically accurate nuke ruining a world. Watching as it explodes, knowing only devastation is to come.  I come back every once in a while when i want to feel something burn in my chest. This has succeeded every single time.
Sorry sb737
Sv737 im a huge fan
Did anyone see the totem blinking?😂
And kids. That's why marbles are dangerous:
19:15 and this, good friends, is why you **always** back up your important stuff. SSD drives can stop without warning.
Investigando ví que la bomba del ZAR de la Unión Soviética es 20 veces más potente que la tuya
Imagine this pops up in my Minecraft world and it blows up. My game would crash
Well thanks to lava for reminding you
It is the classic intel card that makes the motherboard apply to much power
Bro, had to Rick roll us
3:04 MrBeast ahh editing
It's a shame you didn't show the aftermath more at the end though.
Why JUST Why did you rickroll me
Whats the name of your dominoes channel
this is why you keep frequent backups of important things!!
omg
I wish you would have been able to witness it from spectator mode
I would’ve moved the shulkers with chest minecarts lol
never gonna give you up 10:03
23:27 IRON
at 4:40, his xp level is 11331, not 13291, something's up here
I love how he has a crazy complicated autocrater and now the crafter exists
I knew i would be rick rolled
more than 20 blocks per sec is imposseble to place without cheats
Minecraft Mr. Beast
10:13 never gonna give you up??? What ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Step one of making a nuke in Minecraft, step one have a NASA computer
44:13 WE GOT RICK ROLLED
3:30 more like 271k gunpoweder
You're like that one akastski member in Naruto Shippuden who uses clay to blow things up and he says it's the ultimate art form
Dude this is the craziest Minecraft video I've ever seen, genuinely
Great video! It was non stop entertainment
Imagine he forgot to recorded and so he has to do it again but he lost all the resources so he has to get it manually
this is crazy bro😬
UN SUB HIM!!!!!

Damn that song was a banger🕺🎧🎶🎶Cool vid too
Getting Rick rolled in the big 25 smh
Do you noticed The rick roll?
bro rickrolled us 😭
Wunba your insane 💀!!!!
34:29 you could just fly far out with an elytra but just to be able to see it its not gonna explode immediatly like this is SUPER unneccesary also why did you literally build it on top of the tnt its just increasing the chances also since it takes 2 minutes to activate you have SOO much time to fly out its not gonna orbital strike cannon you in any location like cmon
WAIT YOU WERE THAT GUY??? I LITERALLY WATCHED THOSE DOMINO VIDEOS CONSTANTLY!!! I just found your Minecraft channel and I'm catching up on vids!
the number is perfect becuse of 1967  67 67 67 67 67 67 67⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷⁶🤷‍♂⁷
The last part is real rick role
44:20 Rickroll
The heck is Happening With the totem at 24:13? I Slowed it to 0.25
wait if you're allowed mods why not just use AE and make some mob farms to get the stuff needed.. done.. edit: wait so you did not back up your shit after your storage died ? wtf... also If you dont want your storage to die an early death make sure you have a shitload of ram... 32gb minimum.. 64 is good..
not as cool as i thought
When I heard about wunba’s 1st channel at 24:32 to 25:19 I was so sad 😢
Never Gonna Give You Up!?

BRO
I know that song is a Rick roll
I was 14 days old when you started your channel😢
Rick roll 44:06
"Never, Gonna, Give, You, Up😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Be like you have poster number 749 or 751
bro thx
thats actually like 10x or more stronger than a nuke, because if you look at the strength of a tnt and compare it to real life yeah its very strong, Thats because each tnt breaks like 9 meter of stone each side, and that is significantly stronger than our Tnt i dont wanna go in depth so just Yeah
It would have been cool in a future update if the added nuke, black hole, title wave and tornado physics. Like you mine uranium and you have to wear special equipment, a black hole would be gathered by a making a large enough hadron colider and you somehow contain it. Water finally makes waves and during storms, waves on rare occasions get big, you can make bigger boats. And tornados, you can make shelters and ride it out, or be picked up in it.... maybe end up in OZ lol

After so much hardwork it is necessary for me to watch every second of this video without skipping🔥🔥
10:03 10:14 did he just rickroll us?😂😂😂
13:47 rip
Which is the mod that writes how many blocks there are?
Honestly, if he died RIP but this is repeat of squid game just got released before squid game season three respect to this man of guessing
That was amusing... I meant amazing! You created a large tnt like nothing for your subscribers special. I really appreciate all your hard work and your backstories. You are not like any hardcore Minecraft player... I am also a hardcore Minecraft player, and also like watching Minecraft videos, but this video, touched my heart like a like a "never give up" quote. Thanks for the subscribers special. I understand you bro, you created this tnt atomic nuke that we can't call that a atomic nuke in real life, that's like the meteor that killed the dinosaurs back in the early ages but ×100 stronger. Your game crashed, again and again. You lose hope in complete the tnt but the "never give up" quote you used that quote. I don't know how I congratulate you with this, even tho you have gone through several problems, you you never gave up.   I know you are not going to read or care about my comment but congrats. That's all I can say.  Sincerely, ivory.
31:48 why dont wunba got slime monster instead
4:06 the totem blinked
I've seen bigger. I challenge you to a Valkyrien skies create:Big cannons battle.
This video is a case study on the importance of backups.
Never gonna give you up 😂😂
8:55 the way he jumped off his seat 🤣🤣🤣
44:23  that sounds like RICKROLL

Cast will always be the best german redstoner he made it just for fun in his world and he is one of the most famous german minecraft content creators
Broo you cooked entire minecraft youtuberss
1 minute and 52 seconds he places 13 shulkers from 1 shulker box look at his hot bar
the pacing is about the same as the pacing in one peice
34:20 Bro forget about obsidian this nuke can destroy bedrock which needs 900000 to explode
I would be so much more depressed about losing all my files due to a bad motherboard.
you cen dupe an tnt in shulkers with a barrel.
ik that was a rickroll but it felt like i'm going to never giver you my world
17:17 bro built up to heaven
bruh, he rickrolled us❤
"How did your PC break?" "uhh i placed 66 tnt/sec and my ssd card got fried" "no suprise"
never gonna give you up at 10:15
16:51 WHEEL OF DOOM iykyk
If you click F3&F4 when you are dead you can get back
Why rick
3:05 MrBeast ahh feel😂😂😂
My pc crashes when I let one tnt or creeper explode :(
What was the name for the mod/Modpack/website you used to see how much of a block you needed
That rickroll was personal.
10:03 YOU LITTLE (never gonna give you up)
9:50 "hoppers, chests, hoppers pathes, hoppers, hoppers, hoppers and hoppers"                                                                                                                                                                                  edit: i forgot  "
all of this just for a rick roll
When placing the TNT, did anyone notice that he doubled his placing speed after filling every thing with water?
Bro has to much free time 😂
not even1m
The like with most gays is comment
You are clinically insane
12:56 hmm that’s weird
Hoppers hoppers hoppers do u have the course
20:00 bros never heard of RAID storage arrays or external backup hard drives
The music was rick roll at the end lol
Who got the 750 poster?
23:10 how do you even remember what its called
Big, but anyone can blow their whole world up with /replace
i just realized that you could have put all the chests with a hopper and put the hoppers to a ender chest and open the ender chest at the storage when i saw your ender chest
Wait so the pizza guy just waited as ou finished it???
Bro just Rick rolled us 😂💀
I haven't been watching minecraft content in a while. The sheer time an effort put into the planning, concept, farming, building, recording and editing it BAFFLES me. How the FUCK is it possible to watch videos THIS HIGH of quality for free?  Great video, absolutely entertaining throughout the whole thing.
bro made a 45 min video out of what could have been 10 mins… just wasted so much time for a 30 second clip
45:19 tnt explodes
what a waste of time... bro that was really lame
I want to know what the hole looks like rn
Man you are a defenition of perceverence, consistency and dedication ❤🎉 this is cool and mind blowing
the tnt was 161.4 x times stronger than the nuke dropped on Hiroshima
Next time bury the TNT deep underground.  Then drop a bomb-shaped item onto it to ignite it. Then build a  mountain on top of it, or a little bit under one. I used to blow up massive amounts of TNT from inside a cave in creative mode the only place I lived and played. Until my Pocket Edition got erased when they moved platforms. Never went back.
I got Rick rolled🤣
Legendary 2b2t reference 🙏🏽
16:44 Dolphins
tell the diifer so ifried the driv that tnt
im so mad this happened to your pc cause the same happened to mine and took forever to figure out how to fix and i could have easily helped u
Why did you rickroll us 10:40
20:00 if you went to a dedicated data recovery specialist they could possible recover it
have I just been Rick rolled in MC vid
the oppenheimer quote was cold
40:17 Why did you censor your foot?
nah the delivery man is legend
44:10 I KNEW WHAT IT WAS GONNA BE RICKROLL!!! I KNEW IT!!!
Bro had the great reset sfx
18:55 buy a Mac (just kidding. But what’s funny is that Minecraft is actually one of the only few games that this stupid computer can run, and not even bedrock, unless you use an emulator)
you are insane....impressive
44:06 some last tones of the villagers which are at 45:47 😢😢
I'm currently faded off my gourd and I just thought, they should make it so you can brew a bottle o' enchanting into a potion for an xp multiplier for an amount of time.
we got Rick rolled lol
It can break bedrock
You're legendary
Rip chicken ❤😢
At 3:47 if you play it at 0.25 speed you can see the totem BLINKS!?. Crazy right!?.😱 IM NOT JOKING!!!
about 44:00 you really got us with this one
Never Gonna Give You Up
34:03 HEIKOOOOOOOOOOO
W song at the end btw i loved it
Poor Lag :3
would have been cool if the giant tnt block was underground, still a crazy video though
Bro is about to start WW3
That was crazy
when  he said he is gonna mmake a music part it was too obvious i was gonna get rick rolled
He rickrolled us
Oppenheimer
2:37 you know, when the TNT is done, you won't ba able to see the floor 😅
Bro... Dude. Aw I would so crushed being told I lost all that progress. What the hell. Why did it fail like that though? That just seems like the worst luck ever. It makes me think there's something wrong electrically with the PC itself, maybe the power supply, or with the house, like faulty wiring. That's such a punishing lesson to learn about making backups. I know the importance and yet I'm here with no backup of some super important material that if something happened, I would lose it all. But damn, what a miraculous save! Just out of nowhere some guy just saved most all your progress. Sucks about the other stuff that was lost.
I hate dominos!!
Im a big fan love your videos congratulations on 1000 subs
What an effort
10:13 never gonna give you up  😅😂😂oh yea😂😂😂😅GG
even if you die you still have a backup of the world so you can upload it and it will be just fine

It put a smile on my face that you not only tipped the pizza guy, but also warned/informed him he was going to be recorded. It's so rare to see decency from youtubers to service workers these days. :)
i nearly had a stroke at 6:52 but it still was a great video

I may be wrong but he placed 797 blocks per second
Step 1: Buy the nasa pc ✅
Did I got Rick rolld in 2025 by note blocks in a game 😂
Bro had to Rick roll us first
Lets appreciate how much Wumda has used for all this so it could all be destroyed. (atleast you got on camera)
Not having data backup after the first storage scare was CRAZY

For those who didn’t understand when he was storaging he said a secret message “never gonna give you up”
Omg I realized now... that left EYE ITS SO WRONG !!!!!
I was crying when the world would have been lost
Only one life we get and this is how some people spend it...
imaging that with mods
It would not be more powerful that any modern nuke, for example the b83 has a yield of 1.2 million tons of tnt or 1.2 megatons and it’s the biggest in the current us arsenal but compared to tsar bomba a 50 megaton nuke that is over 50 times more powerful than the b83 you can now see just how big nukes really can get
45:33 I love how the pig is so calm when there is a nuke behind him
He said Never Gonna Give You Up
sneaking never gonna give u up is pro gamer 10:03
ai poster art. ts pmo icl
Did u die?

Bros livelihood was on that drive and he wasn’t using redundant storage crazy work
Bro the last moment was drama
The best gaming video in my whole life. And mark my word, I've watched a tonne of them. Just subscribed. This is a world record. I was in tears, clapping all the way through to the end, since you started the chain reaction with that red pebble. This is amazing. I mean AMAZING. I'm stuck for words.
44:10 IZ DAT A RICKROLL??????
Wow! Great job!!
Did you survive the blast in your hardcore world????????????
We all got rickrolled😅🤣
Can't believe this. We just got rickrolled here (44:12) and it's awesome. It's still a domino effect.
Why is his inventory blured? 41:08
You earned a new subscriber from me! Incredible dedication and creativity. Would love it if you could make a video utilizing the tnt crater in some way. A high-definition overhead shot of the aftermath would be amazing!
This is how the  big bang  theory started
Thanks Wunba, I hate you now for rickrolling us all.
ur uptade schedule is bad but ur videos are peak so update sched doesnt matter
31:21 AHH-

What did the poor pc do to you
Am I the only one that noticed he was rickrolling us
Thank God you didn't die or it whood be all over
Having ur SSD storage fried, then buying a new one, moving everything there, and not making backup thereafter to avoid same mistake - is peak genius
This man might be a jr Oppenheimer 😅
LUDICROUS SPEED
whats the old channell name or did you delete it
RICKROLL at 10:03-10:15 in yellow text
top 5 mc videos of all time

Next episode: Breaking your own world record for TNT explosions
the same laptop as me MSI!!!
just wear  a turtle helmet
The crafter would be nice😊😊😊 12:18
13:42 It’s pronounced nuclear, not nukelar….
You've won my subscribe, I didn't realize for the first 3 videos of yours I watched but you were the domino channel I used to watch. (Realized when you mentioned the channel, it made me really happy to hear and got you to take up the 5th [and last in a while] spot in my list :)
Ain't no way bro rickrolled us in 2025 at 44:05💀💀
YO THE DOMINOS GUY?
I don’t understand how him being underwater helped him set tnt down faster
"Never  gonna give you up"?
41:05 WHY IS THERE ANOTHER WUNBA?!!! Ohhh nvm
Just dupe the tnt 😭🙏
Wow dude, that was awesome!
Brilliance
I think I would’ve “exploded” I found out the entire world was gone 😂
Bro Did this a year ago is is still not at 2 million unbelievable ☠️ . Who is here in 2025 👇
Blockenheimer
New editor goes crazy😂😂
Cool world record <‐--(real, I swear)
8:50  only a maximum of 3 strongholds can spawn in a world
What mod dose he use for the blueprints and item lists?
1:40 sadly not  1.3 million Minecraft TNT blocks would produce an explosion of about 2.1 kilotons, which is: 	•	Much weaker than Hiroshima (15 kt) 	•	About the strength of a very small tactical nuclear weapon 	•	~190× stronger than the MOAB, the most powerful conventional (non-nuclear) U.S. bomb  So while Minecraft TNT seems massive in-game, even 1.3 million blocks together would still be far below historical nuclear weapons like Hiroshima.
My man’s thumbnail is the mark 27 nuke💀
44:24 🫡
Hoppers hoppers and hoppers hit hard
di=oesnt look big untioll u say it in shulkers
45:26 click if you're lazy to wait
When you were mentioning the equipment for storing sand why did I hear you 😂
unlike what nooba doe, you actually do it all in hardcore/survival
Why did you Rick roll me?????😤😤😤😡😡😡😡😡
rip chicken 😢
Most convoluted Rick roll ever
44:14 I guessed it: Rick roll!
The amount of dedication into this video is miraculous well done man you've done great ❤
Now I’m kinda curious about what your sat score is.😅
37:05 THE CUP, RELEASE!
bro became Oppenheimer at the end
I would have watched this from the hospital if u didn’t put the flash warning there so thanks epilepsy is so fucking annoying
dude wtf. 45 minutes of building and only 10 seconds of footage of the aftermath? are you kidding me?
Bro explode a 1,3 megaton nuclear bomb in Minecraft lol
Pc bouta be the next nuke
10:00 Nice rickroll
Wow!

Bro just rickrolled us in minecraft lol
44:14 vibin'
W pizza guy
Does anyone remember the dudes building it with the song astronomia ? Am i the only one?
i need your help can i transfer my hardcore from one minecraft on my microsoft acc to another minecraft on another microsoft acc?
Flash warning at  4:35
How about building a bigger tnt!!!
he compared his to the first ever nuclear bomb so i was curious i looked up what the biggest nuclear bomb ever exploded was and it was the tsar bomb which was equal to 58000 kilotons of tnt
my pc can't even handle 60 fps, my computer would explode.
24:10 Isn't that in the official minecraft building manual?
POV: A spider crawls into your PC and won't pay rent:
what if a random zombie just ran over the pressure plate
getting rick rolled song is crazyy😂😂
I really thought I was gettin Rick rolled at the song
16:48 the cat shadow😂
Legend has it that there is still a delivery driver standing out the front door holding a pizza.
Wunba fastest way to move 4000 shulkers in putting shulker in shulker in shulker
16:46 For some reason this part here reminded me of that one Star Wars ripoff with like the shortest Darth Vader I've every seen 😂    (Sorry, I forgot the name.)
Villagers at the village right next to the giant tnt: "Hmm I wonder what a giant tnt is doing here?"
Hey wunba, what schematic mod do you use?
Turn on xmp for your ram
44:50 is more intense than me seeing if I'm going to live or not.💀
Satisfying but only if its not laggy
Your dedication is absolutely insane! 🎉🎉🎉
17:30 why are you like the only hardcore YouTuber aware that dolphins drown😂
I'm German and it was very surprising that the record was also German
The red marble be like: I'm a world destroyer
This video made me subscribe your channel!
how does the totem blink!?!?!?!?!?
W pizza delivery guy
44:06 i dodged it too But I listened it later...
32:35 Never gonna give you up
10:08 Nope i dodge it... Nice try
15:25 *about to loose the whole hardcore game* We need conduits
Want a HUGE ONE (1000 height)
Tho the thing is a creator named Mud Flaps has done this exact challenge simalarly vut with NO blocks so i would think its possible to get back bud 😂
If I did that, my PC would blow the Earth in half
6:59
6:69
Wow what
34:02 this ist castcrafter from germany🇩🇪🇩🇪
27 is the number of people in my class
most skilled hardcore player I've ever seen, PLUS the REAL LIFE chain reaction! Wow.
33:24 THE FINAL COUNTDOWN💅💅
What’s the name of the music at 19:21?
i knew the music
GRAVITRAX!!!!!!!!!!!
i thought you were going to rick roll us
fr tho why does wunba sound like a middle aged dude but looks 20 while rekrap looks like a middle aged dude and sound likes hes 20 WHY
Didnt a lot of youtubers blow up whole worlds by covering them in tnt?
4:34 how did you just lose 2000 levels?
Bros compute just booted into his bio so he got rid of his bio somehow
Wunba you are wrong. The internet you exploded is 113.700> times more powerful than the first ever nuke in history.😂😂😂 [   >  =forever]
You have 1 mil subs... I'm pretty sure your gonna be able to play rent unless your extremely impulsive.
Your mc skin looks nothing like you unless its supposed to be your gf otherwise I'm not judgin
Thank you so much Wunba for entertaining us
This video went way to hard for a minecraft hardcore gameplay..
That was one of the best videos I've ever watched. Thank you.
Bruh 44:13
Um 18:52
you should probably have more than a 650 psu unless your running poor guy parts in your pc
not an ssd its an nvme and it shouldn't fry and its way cheaper online
Bro rickrolled us 😂
Actually one of the slickest Rick roll 10:04
This guy is insane bro I would get bored after 1 min of placing bocks 💀💀💀💀
Wtf i watched a masterpiece 😮
What a faulty power supply unit
Bro why didnt you show the aftermath more?
You should always make back ups of projescts this big on a separate machine and cloud storage.
I had that same problem with my computer, mobo was overvolting the front USB headers. Disconnected the USBs from the mobo and that was the fix.
I have that Marble Run
OWWWWHH--HH MY PCCCCCCCC
24:23
That one water bucket that decides to change gender to lava
A 10x10 tnt makes me lag like crazy
you should make it 2 block bigger for TWO shells, one tnt and one sand and grey shell, because tnt needs 4 gunpowder and 5 sand or vise versa.
you were the Domino guy?
fire music
Aint no way 6.18 million people got rickrolled
And chicken
Rip phantom
13:03 The 2 nukes are crazy didn't know we goin back there
Mincrfat tnt
I subbed after that
It was awesome to Watch I play minecraft on PlayStation
you broke the world record
9:51 hoppers, hoppers, hoppers, hoppers, oh and did i mention anything about hoppers????
1%: actually interesting  99%: yapping
Bro is acting😂😂😂❤❤❤ and I feel bad 😭😭😭
old record: the cube of tnt is a nuke new record: your pc is a nuke
at 39:30 did the totem blink? Awsome animation.
L
Did wunba die?
Most elaborate Rick roll man
Bro just turned into russia
34:05 jay castcrafter ist der beste
What about the pizza
Bro really had to rick roll us
Getting rickrolled about a video of making a nuke in minecraft is crazy
Thats just overkill
9:51  hoppers paths hoppers hoppers hoppers hoppers hoppers hoppers and hoppers🔥🔥
I came here expecting a simple ''each block is 1 ton of tnt'' but I got the incel version.
never gonna give you up he said
10:21  "I got a new editor, lmk what you think" Me: "it's really amazing, it's so amazing even Mr Beast editor wouldn't able to beat you 😊"
Bro almost died drowning
did he survive? I didn’t see
All this just to blow it up😂
35:50 if you wanna see it explode
All that and you did NOT give any sort of clean view of the crater? The shots at the end never actually show the full crater. Bro, seriously, what? Aaaaaall of this and you leave us hanging on such a short payout which ends in blueballing. Crazy.
16:47 you mean light speed method
The "never gonna give you up" was the peak of this video
Comment if you like the video: okay here's the real thing THIS THING IS A NUKE My friends in the background: WE ARE GOING TO DIE!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 0:49
Repent and trust in Jesus. We all deserve Hell for our sins, such as lying lusting coveting and more. We can't save ourselves, but Jesus can save us. He died on the cross to save us for our sins and rose from the grave defeating death and Hell. You must put your faith in him only. He is the only way to Heaven. Repent and trust in Jesus.  Romans 6:23​ John 3:16​
BOOOOMMMMM!!!!!!!!
44:16 …
please say nu-clear instead of nu-kyuh-ler
What about the pizza bro, I am sure you must have taken it at some point in between.
"Superb" tactics 😂😂😂
Why’d you Rick roll us
bro took "creativity is endless" to seriously
44:22
0:18 build this bomb 😭🙏
the amount of times he rick rolled us
hi
why does the totem blink
44:05 we got Rick rolled 💀
Mumbo and wunba are the same person, change my mind.
Why not show the aftermath properly after such a long build up. Im dissappinted massively...
17:13
I just got rickrolled and noticed it on the “up” part😭💀
I hope he saved the world
Always create a second backup on an external hard drive.
Why all seams more and more randomly generated? Are you AI?????😮
i bet lava is like OHH MY I SAVED HIS PC AND HIS WORLD LESS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
am i weird that i acctualy like rickroll?
the poor chicken I realized he can't escape
He just rick rolled us bro
Bro has so much free time
This video is so dope
You need a back up world
9:51 😅😅😅😅
He really thought we wouldn't notice th never gonna give you up
45:30 TECHNOBLADE NEVER DIES 😭🙏
19:18 So that man sold you your world? This is too much greed. Too much greed for money.
Rick roll
44:17 did he r......
Each Wunba surprised me that there is still something left of ressources in his world
I love what you are doing
you should set up a redundant external hard drive that is not connected to any system after loading important documents onto it
10:07  never gonna gitve you up
I never played minecraft but this whole operation u did was insane
you said "sand doupers" instead of sand dupers at 9:05
Never gonna give you up XDD
I also have this pc error rn but i think its my graphic card
wunba i beat your record with 1 billion tnt good luck beating that friend em if you want idc but gl to destoy 2 billion 300k 300m tnt
Maybe you should upgrade to Intel CPUs 18:52
Honestly, if the delivery guy would NOT have started the 2nd chain, i would have made a petition to get him fired xD i mean, come on... he works for DOMINO's 😀
wunba: "tnt is really satisfying" me: "well, when its not setting your pc on fire, yeah"
I don't want to kick a man on the ground but why the heck did you not get redundant storage after the first time your SSD died? Your data is your wealth.
Step one but a 9950x3d
44:02 i got rickrolled
How is he flying 31:13 😅
44:19 my dog thought someone came home😂 edit: Someone came home😱
28:57 “Oops! I slipped my water!” 💀🙏
its funny seeing someone use ahk for a youtube video bc i just use it to make macros and play around lol
Bruh you rickrolled us!
I more for modded playthoughs, so don't care much if a world is hardcore. honeslty
It's like watching plankton make Karen.
You not making a backup on an external drive after the first time your PC broke is genuinely negative 200 IQ behaviour... If you permanently lost it all the second time you would have 100% deserved it. Imagine almost losing files you said are very important AND the minecraft world your entire channel and income is based around and then you did NOT make a backup after that experience... that is just beyond crazy to me. That is like you WANTED it all to be lost.
0:11 and also breaking your pc
Has anyone made any lore for this animation? Or has onur posted anything? If not and you read this onur, can I use this as inspiration and write my own lore and backstory to this scene something about it is pulling at me.?
I never knew you can do this stuff on Minecraft how the hell are people this good at it
10:03 the start of an amazing ASMR Also the yellow letters Rick rolled you😂
bro is starting 8 diferent project in one video 😭😭
9:50 bro forgot about the hoppers
why does it do 1 instead of one
17:48 best moment because it gives us so much info 😊
bro his pc is floating on the ceiling rn
I came to this video after seeing the Russian translation of this video and subscribed. ❤
I found his another channel is Wunba irl
I really want to make Dominos now, not the pizza brand. I don’t even know how to because I’m 7 (the pizza brand I can do Dominos)
Tremendo
I'm convinced this man is God's strongest autistic. With enough motivation he could probably figure out how to transfer himself inside minecraft and then from there figure out how to somehow time travel into the past and then transfer himself back out into the real world back in 2010 when minecraft ran on a computer for the first time. Salute to you bro
my rent is in jeopardy
Where'd you get that marble stuff? That's super cool looking
How do you have such good posture during long play sessions?
10:05 never 10:07 gonna 10:09 give 10:10 you 10:13 up  44:07 awesome sonk
The 'never gonna give you up' reference is just great
When the final countdown starts, it’s to Trinity from Oppenheimer.
Best rickroll trick😂
0:00 he's right THEY ARE SO TİNY  Edit: at 44:10 I didint think he'd rickroll me -_-
Lowkey, with all that tnt, you could destroy the whole nether
You rushed it too much, “enjoy the process”
Damn you are cute
The fact that he breaks an world record, spends 100s of dollars, AND ALSO TOUCHES GRASS, is 😍
Am I tripping from the insta reels or did I see a swastika and a p3n1s shaped firework at 41:46
Boom moment  45:19
Jason is best
Bro Rick roll us on 44:07
Next make tsar Bomba. please!

We got rickrolled
there are two kinds of people in this world  people who watch yt videos  And people who make them.
Noooooooooooo 19:45
Omg 18:48 ur so devoted
Tmscy.
Use code pear in Fortnite item shop
did you die
13:45 it will become a new nuclear bomb in real life.
The biggest TNT to ever TNT.
Mi bombogyro
10:04 it took me like 3-4 replays to figure u were rick rolling us
"collecting nether wart blocks was so annoying" thats why you should know crafts
44:44 thank me later
my cat enjoyed watching this video, and I agree with her ^v^
have you later dummy you know you don't have to play star blocks Play Store water a top Play Store water a top inside first layer a top of layer first layer with water random water will flow down and you are done you sneaky idiot
12:35 this is PEAK EDITING
33:20 imagine all of the drowneds drop nothing
Did you copy your world?????
OH HOLY FRICK DID THAT GPU DIE Update after watching further: Why tf was a storage issue causing GPU errors...?
10:03 i just go Rick rolled..
my friend would fr hit my base with this and say “it’s just a prank bro”
21:45 no dolphin look out
44:06 did bro just rickroll us in the most unique way?💀
how do youtubers in minecraft get outside views of special moments like this and get cinematic graphics suddenly?
another rickroll 44:04
wait I thought lol
why is there another one of u 41:04
9:59 he has a backup of his hardcore world
i just got rickrolled10 minutes in
almost 1.5m now
36:35 the marble is actually in gravitrax that holds world records and etc.

10:05 How dare you rickroll us
10/10 for the effort it was worth it
44:00 I KNEW IT RAHHH
Bro rickrolled us
44:06 i saw this from a mile away
@Mojang gotta see this❤❤❤
Spot all the secret rickrolls.
Poor chicken
you Rick rolled me
No make a 1000 giga tons of TNT in Minecraft but the TNT is 0.0000000000001 milograms
press F2 18:36
Bro Rick rolled us
I think bro invented the atomic bomb😂😂😂😂
You know what’s scary? The Minecraft nuke that Wunba made was only 2421 kilotons which as he stated, was roughly 130x the size of Fatman, however, the Tsar Bomba (worlds largest nuclear device ever detonated) was 50 megatons (50,000 kilotons) making the Tsar Bomba roughly 20.65x the size of Wunba’s nuke. That might not seem like a lot but for reference, the Tsar Bomba was roughly 2,381x the size of Fatman. If that doesn’t make you realise how big the Tsar Bomba really was, then I don’t know what will.
DUDE I WENT THROUGH IT AGAIN AND I FOUND "never gonna give you up" 🆘😩
9:46  Ludicrous:who called for ludicrous?   state far-
thank you for all your hard work on this
You built a nuke
Das ist der TNT män
Hopper man!!!!!!!!

Team hoppers
Not enough hoppers…
Drama queen

Sb737 do I no Ur friend lockdownlife
Remember, it’s about the journey, not the destination
That fact that bro secretly rick rolled us is crazy 10:03
Hey, Wunba, I challenge you to make a gigantic charged creeper/non-charged creeper
isn't that hardcore world shared? i thought i saw myles in it too (found this channel through myles) so i thought myles and some other people has that world saved too.
I got rickrolled😂
I started my first channel in 2016 too
36:10 wait.. YOU TOO HAVE GRAVITRAX!?
And then the crafter block came out
Love the video ❤😊
Amazing video ❤😊
What the hoppers 9:54
A you Died ?
I heard that rickroll at 10:13...
wow
Bro actually rick rolled us😅
Meh.
Who thinks its a wrick rold
Sometimes hardcore YouTubers sound like they are being tortured for this and won’t leave until they’re done and please they’re holding him captive help him pleas
why are you bluring your feet?
3:56  did that totem just blink?? 😮
lil late for this but fire also why your totem blink
Not running a storage backup/data recovery process after the PC died the FIRST TIME just shows how foolish you are. I have no words. You deserved everything that could have happened to be honest
44:13 i hate you bruh
That's so anticlimactic
Bro i have 38.5 million tnt in my world
american megatrends? is this an old fuckin office pc or?
23:00 mogswamp was the same
guys respect for this dude for not giving up and keeping his promise even when his pc fried 2 times
13:28 just 300 kilotons from being the strongest nuke ever
Why fire at nether portal?
Video starts at @45:14
I think the problem you had with your ssd is because im gonna guess you have a 990 pro or 980pro wich have had problems in the past
25:22 or the biggest seen most games crash so you can't see then
you could have used an enderchest set connect one end up to your shulker deposit and the other end to your building plstorage. if you use me system you can do 96 items per tick
Bro build an atomic bomb both in minecraft and irl
132gb of slow ddr4? Why on earth would you do that
This vid was like a year ago lol
At 8:00 instead of making eyes of ender just use chunk base
750🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Let him cook🧑‍🍳😡😡😡😡
Give him 100,000,000 subs
Once i hade a glitch my tnt didnt go boom
46:18 did you die or not???

I should watch your videos in in a super awesome way. This will change your issue one day. I know I know that’s all that was gonna be even more subscribers. I know you hit 1 million but the hard-core world is gonna be great very great. That means you even knew things would would come by you do my things you would know exactly how to build giant builds and your in your subscribers will never end. This was already great.❤
that not so hidden "never going to give you up" :) LOL
Someone give this guy a cookie cuz he earned it
3:09 bro did the tnt dirty with that .5 😂😭💀
That was the worst Edit
Nahh thats crazy with 200k-300k tnts your pc is frozed thats crazy
Aint no way bros totem was blinking 😂
It can break bedrock!
I am sorry but  I cannot because I would die in my  second day
13:52 OMG I thought you had a slow falling 999 potion on when I realised it’s just that the TNT block is so big
Bro Rick Rolled us Rick Ashley bruh. Thats my new alarm noise
Hes like ok when WUnba spent like hours and weeks building it
Lol, the pizza man probably didn't expect to see those dominos there

I haven't even finished the video yet but the sheer amount of effort and dedication this took made me like and subscribe

nice cloud effects by the way
New Subscriber!
The PC: Finally, a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary!
i think i have never noticied this but the totem blinks???
40:16 bro blured his foot because maybe can be smelling bad 😂
Bro rickrolled us 10:05
42:02 legend says the delivery guy is still waiting for his tip at the door
10:00 Rickroll
broh i was so sad that your PC fried, but after that i just enjoyed the music and rebuilding bcs OMG I EARLY DIED THERE
Where that music was i thought this was an alan becker video😂
27:00 yoo i have the same keyboard
10:18 rickroll
if anyone deserves a sub its this guy. i really respect how much work u put into ur vids keep up the amazing work
A server can not even Handel 10’000 tnt
Mr beast made a video he blowed a hole Minecraft world 🌎 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
No contamination is radioactive material left over from
world record my ass i once made a minecraft world that was all tnt like im sure the rest of us have tried, and detonating it literally made my xbox turn off
The most anticlimactic mine craft video I’ve ever watched. My son and I watch a lot of videos on your channel and as fascinating the build and preparation was but to sit through all of that to barely see the explosion was a waste of time. Very disappointed
10:00 never… gonna… give… you… up…
What  Are you doing
1967 Kilotons☠️
Did u survive?
My phone Is small but my phone is survived
Imagine doing this whole shit and not showing a SECOND of the world that was left behind. Cringe minecraft YouTuber.
did you see the hidden rick-roll when he was colecting the materials for storage system?🤣
Did he died?
Where do you find all these blueprints
Did the shelter work in the end?
Bro has more shit then I do on atm 10😭
Shoutout to the guy who asked for the updated download
Great fun
What a dissapointing end to the video. You spent all that time just to show less than a minute of a cinematic shot of the tnt blowing up, would have much rather preferred a less edited version of u taking shelter in ur base as the explosion was going off and then a few minutes going over the aftermath, what a shame.
Jason was one of the only reasons this happened
32:37 hope you payed your rent also your a absolute legend your effort is insane
Okay am I just crazy or does Jason look like Benedict Cumberbatch?
Rick roll at 10:03
Bro needs to write a script and start taking hourly backups of his projects. Once you experience data loss, you never make the same mistake again....
A RICKROLL AHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
If you like your own comment your technically more popular than YouTube because YouTube has once commented for a year and it is 0 likes :( pls help YouTube fellow citizens
😮
This guy needs an ocar.
Wumba i apreciate you so much as a new viewer you have talent and you are so dedicated dont stop you are great!!
11:05 did his totem just blink?
22:09 yes u did
R.I.P the chicken
1:58 JORTSTORM!!!!
Did you survive the explosion after it all finished, did any of the totems go off?
Hi SB737 i watch your videos
4000 shulker boxes?!!! Who the heck can just afford 4000 shulker boxes that's absurd!!!
13:29 5,000,000,000 pounds 5T 💀🥚
Bro you are the most dedicated person i’ve ever seen ❤
20:30
bro had a bad SAT because he was too busy with Dominos
if any of you guys play osu! then you should know he uses the aller font
"I Have become death, destroyer of the worlds........" -Wunba
44:20 i didn't throught wunba will rickroll us like that 😭
7:44 dont ask
I am 9
44:00 wow i like that  i think it sounded like rick roll but ok
The marble part be like Wunba ASMR
I’m glad I skipped all the way to the end I mean farticus …quack ….
What kinda auto clicker does he use 😭
is it just me or did i just realize that totums of undying blink
10:02 i see what you did there.
THIS IS ACTUALLY EPIC
When you set off 2.4 megatons of TNT in a block game and your PC lives to tell the tale
now you need to hit 2 mill subs
did you die
Someone call Peta I found a man force feeding a tadpole
That rickroll was smart…. usually I’d be mad… but mad… respect.
44:07 rickroll warning
During the sand storage farm I heard Never Gonna Give You Up... WHAT
Wunba,  I love your content but Why do you need a wooden axe instead of a netherite axe.  By the way I love you
19:00 Maybe you just need a bit of Opera GX
make numbers in your upcoming videos please
Stupid test hoppers too endchest lol
what auto clicker are u using
what mods do you use
#castcrafter GHG
Your name kinda look like wenda
17:15  Step two is to *erect* a giant pillar in less than a millisecond
I need that mod
2:44 you good Wunba?
It is so incredible that built it in gamemode 0. 😮
Alternative title: Minecraft bro does triple the engineering and R&D of the f*king Manhattan project single handedly just to blow off the entirety of his hardcore world in a matter of seconds
Cascrafter my boy got metioned😮
10:10 you
How does he get so many shulker boxes????
I love this
17:10 starstruck odyssey theme
What’s the mod he used to copy the layout of the tnt
What is that mod that lets you have a print?
I usually don't thumbs up minecraft videos but just because of your work ethic I liked the video. Well done, very respectable.
isn’t it odd how nobody mentions how W the computer guy was for even trying to fix it
4:40 How do you get gunpowder from a raid farm?
Feels like one Minecraft YouTuber make black and yellow barrier runways for their experiments and now they all do
you lost 311 dollars on my birthday
And 5 mins later some 5 year old uses commands to fry his fathers nasa pc
Wunba most likely got  new CPU cooler and fans costing 1m dollars just for this vid
Bro my heart was beating so fast lolll
Hello, good video, but I have a question. Can you tell me what kind of sanding machine you used for the sand? and is it only for sand?
If humanity were as collectively motivated as this one guy, we would have built a dyson sphere around the sun by now.
Or 90,899,898,100,67 TNT
No did it for 409,679,997 TNT
How ba-a-a-ad can I be
"Never gonna give you up!" 💙💙💙 thanks
those who know...
Wunba!!! I LITERALLY CRIED!!! ❤
Did you die in the end
me sad we no see crater
OHHHH MY PCCCCC!!!!!!
make a orbital strike cannon
I see you are pulling a Mr Beast here and incetivising your audience to spend money on your shop by offering prices to win (=illegal lottery).
Hey I enjoyed the video, but would it be possible moving forward to put an epilepsy warning when doing time lapse of day to night. My girlfriend got a seizure because of it
I want to explore that devastation so bad
What breakfast did u have?
TNT
Bro Rick Rolled us at 44:08
did it crash your hardcore world and did you die!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????????????
41:08 do we talk about the duplicate 😂
poor village XD
Clickbait title.
44:04 i've been rickrolled
My mind was boggled through this entire video... bruh..
I KNEW I GONNA BE RICKROLLED
And the pain and go to the hospitala nd the money thats gonna costs
44:07  mother$&*@! are u serious!? A rickroll?!
The chest storage organization is insane
40:17 bro blurred his feet😂😂🤣🤣
44:21 bro rickrolled us
bro the music is rick Roll !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The song rick roll seriosly you rick roll us
Showing your garbage contraption instead of the explosion is a sure way to end up with a dead channel in a few months, and look where you are
HC worlds arent impressive when you cheat
10:11 ahh dang it
these videos are crazy! seems like your whole life is mincraft
i mean its just not mathematically accurate is it, 1.3 million TONS of TNT is needed not 1.3 million 1x1 meter blocks of TNT
How to dubble like a Video?
thank god he didnt overreact, jeez
How does that pizza guy feel about causing so much destruction
Love ur vids. Keep up the good work man!
well thats just a big bomb not a nuke it doesnt use any nuclear explosives     better title:i built a bomb as powerful as a nuke in minecraft
20:10 Never give up never let yourself down never lose hope and faith
You are the best
The rick roll music caught me off gaurd🤣
bet what???😁
32:39 ele censurando o pézinho veyr
Wait its more powerful than a real life giant mushroom?
why this soooooong
I haven't really watched or played Minecraft in 5 years or so. It is amazing all the things you can automate now. It almost feels like the old Tekkit mod.
would of just been easier to download the hyperedit mod for single worlds could of saved you hours  of placing tnt
mkjn bvgcf  esde
Øl
nice video i subcribed
At 10:10 rickroll
bruhhh i just got rick rolled infront of everyone
rickroll at 10:18 is crazy
That totally sucked
2:44 *someone please send help they are holding me          captive and won't let me stop working                     until I finish the video!"
why did I know that he would rickroll us?
bro the music part was a rickroll :(
One of the most heartfelt hardcore minecraft videos i've ever seen icl
2:56 did he just quote Oppenheimer
did you died?
10:06-10:13 the fact he casually whispers "never" "gonna" "give" "you" "up" like we wouldnt notice! LOL!!
45:30 pig: this is the end
can i have an try what is it
The night the sky lit up
The rick roll tho...
This is next level Bro! You deserve more Subs!
Man, what about going in creative typing a command more than the tnt you putted, the most easiest way
What is that item calculator you're using? I need it for my Mekanism fission reactor, turbine hall, and induction matrix.
45:30 was crazy
50h??????😮
This video had me SOO hyped for the explosion. He spent LITERAL months of his life just for an explosion in Minecraft. But it was worth it.
44:09 AGAIN?!
12:01 crafter: am I a joke to you
I blew up more tnt (in creative), but forgot to take a screenshot, so no one will believe me!
Computer: bye bye *crashes*
10:02 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
realy did it with the hoppers and the hoppers and the hoppers and the hoppers
1.33M TNT
57621 Deaths
why'd you rickroll me?
don't delete the channel keep going! never give up! theres always problems throught the life but it can be fixed because a problem is solvable!
Drama
no way bro rickrolled us at 10:05 -_-
10:18 he rickrolled us 😂
As a redstone amateur scientist, you have my respect.  ...and my subscription.
The way he Rick rolled us 😢
‘Cause I’d like to see the world
Can you make this world a server on Minecraft bedrock?
Get rickrolled!!!😂😂
That explosion was louder than my grandad snoring just about😂
44:19 that is the most mad lad way to rickroll anyone, and that I the most incredible thing I have ever seen
Bro wunba editor is cracked
Damn,.  you are creative and smart,.  respect
Never say, the only or the biggest ever,... there are dimensions of what people already have built
Bro broke 2 records most tnt in survival/hardcore and best rickroll😭😭
you said the Oppenheimer quote wrong. History nerd here. it is actually "Now I havee become death... The destroyer of worlds..."
that song was never gonna give you up😂
My brain while in a test:
Based on the ending, I'm assuming that the computer froze or lagged out or had some other sub-optimal end.
22:52 "Following" sand tower?
All of "a" sudden, not all of "the" sudden."
lol is anyone gonna believe you did it all in survival? No way, you would have spend years on it
Dit you get a reward 🤓
Hoppers
Dont fycking tell me it was you ,in the garage with your dad ,building that pyramid under the wooden walls .🫡
Happy 1,000,000 subscribers 🎉🎉
IDK but thi video is so complicated 😂😂
BRO AT THE THING AT THE 10TH MINUTE I WAS LIKE WUT THEN OOOOO I C
You sly son of a gun you Rick rolled us. If your wondering where its between 10:00 and 10:15 in orange writing
RIP Skavio 😢
pizza man still waiting outside to give him the pizza
Redstone ender pearl teleporting, im still learning 😮
Bro feeled Like he won a war😂😂
44:10 I KNEW THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD BE
1B
in 2031 I Will Break The World Record
He really rickrolled us, and got away with this. Also, this video is the greatest video I've ever seen in my life.
Buy Starforge computer (which costs 3500-4000$ pro version 💀) and it womt fry 😂
Guys ts
Your story made me cry and I felt bad for you having all that pain so I subscribed ❤
I MNEW IT WAS GONNA BE A RICKROLL
...And then he doesn't tell us whether or not he survived. : /
5. 4. 3. 2. 1 0.
You've actually become DETH
Dam   bros   pc  is  beacaming a  fryed  fries
I’m only checking the add too much TNT it breaks and the computer will no longer work 3:45
I feel like the point of long-term hardcore worlds is to do stupidly massive projects with all the farms players make in them.
never gonna give you up bruh
And this, kids, is why you practice the 3-2-1 backup method. There is no reason for something this important to you to only be saved on one drive on an actively used PC. Good job on the project btw!
Can buy that
3:58 bro crafted a autocrafter and spent precious minutes building little did he know crafters were being added
44:23 he rick rolled us again. I was kinda expecting that one actually.
1+ new tnt :)
10:00 to 10:17 he was secretly rick rolling us!
😮
😓😓
8:06 Bro knew what he was doing with the music
Well actully its alot more powerful than any nuke. Its as powerful as more than 18 billion of the most powerful nuke ever
I KNEW IT WAS RICK ROLL!
Get to the damn point
0:56 oh wow what mod is this
Not the rick roll 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Craziest 1Million surprise
Wunda must of had a great childhood,his parents raised him well.❤
this is probably one of the only "MASSIVE PROJECT IN HARDCORE" videos that you can say "this took me hundreds of dollars"
42:59  did any one else see the totam blink😂
whyyy?? JUST WHYYYY??? WHY DID U RICK ROLL US? WHYYYY???
i was born in 2016
2:44 someone please send help they are holding me captive and won't let me stop working until i finish the video!
143 I see….CASE 143 MENTIONE- yea I’ll shut up now….
"Oh, I wasn't recording!" Imagine💀💀
This is the kind of script divy made a video about lmao…  Jason my boi
Lol Test  Operagx  To not frie your computer
44:21 bro rick rolled us😂
200 backips
70 bios
power co-psition 700000 V
13+15+17+19 cpu

haha my ssd is not fryd
18:54 gets a screen and unable to turn computer on. also him a minute later *uses google and yt tutorials*
they should've made dolphins breedable bc then you could just have a LOT of dolphins
Poor chicken in the end
...CHAIN REACTION ..nice...BUT I REMEMBER EVEN greater EXPLOSIONS OF TNT,THO  ......
Stop
Bro what an ending
2:57 OPPENHEIMER REFERENCE
CINEMA
I bought minecraft but cant play can somebody help me? ( I got java and bedrock )
i totally forgot about gravitrax's existence until now lolll
Steve’s so much powerful he went in the End, killed its owner and used its house to make a fun big explosion
Did we just got Rick rolled? 😂
Nice Video I love your hardcore vids
This bomb ain't no 2421 kilotons, it's 2,421 megatons.
1:58 JORT STORM, JORT STORMS COMIN’ TONIGHT!
am i the only one who noticed the "never gonna give you up" he snuck in
(Sorry I'm late) Let's just take a moment to appreciate how hard and long this took For him to do this and remember he did this for us for the entertainment Thank you Wunba!
Did anyone else catch the Rick Roll when he listed out the required items for the storage?
I saw a video of a dancing creeper on TikTok and now I am here
I wanted to see the explosion at the end more… I feel like your guy was safe inside, but I feel like maybe you should’ve had like another person visit the world and watch it from a distance so that they could at least have footage of it exploding
38:13 I only found out that there were time stamps
thats like a 200 tsar bomba detonated😂😂
10:21 you have a good editor
Man, god is on your side with that Minecraft world ❤
This is the most clickbait/viewerbait video I've come across in a while. Don't waste your time.
I want to explore the hole it left
legend has it, the explosion from his PC was bigger
So 2,421kt of TNT or roughly 2.4mt of TNT is roughly a bit weaker than the Canopus nuclear bomb, the first two stage nuclear bomb made in France...
40:25 this is why minecraft youtubers stay inside
I call, this is fake
That song you put on was the Rick Roll song😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I dare you not to kill any chicken for one real life day in Minecraft😢😢😢❤
I don't even play minecraft. Why did I watch it 😂
Everyone that detonates more than 100k tnt says they have the world record lmao (i saw a guy exploding 3 million tnt like 7 years ago and i bet it wasn't a record at the time either) But the guy kinda just //set a bunch of tnt and that's it so yeah less impressive
Why the Rick roll 44:25  😂
too good really is so much work
trash game, trash video. waste of time.
how u get so much wood for chests?
Did it blow up?
I watched some of your old you videos
I got rickrolled an not believe it! Lol
Imagine having your pc break down and almost lose all your data, and then NOT MAKING A BACKUP when you're lucky enough to get it recovered
Engineering? No, Minecraft
Miller Dorothy Smith Edward White Jose
This just showed up on my algorithm. Is it normal for this guy to just use glitches, mods, and auto clickers to do everything? Pretty bold to just say "yeah, im lazy"
14:02 just move to europe
Bro actually just Rick rolled us
The Minecrafthatten Project
44:17 When you were building it, the first thing I thought, "Oh, It's gonna be something like a rickroll, isn't it?"
The determination is unreal. One time some weird stuff happened to my ssd when i was using unity and my pc bricked for months. One day i randomly decided to plug it in again and it worked. I still have no clue why it happened. But some games just cause your pc to do funky things in the hardware that we aren't even aware of 😂
7:11 dawg what
15:23 He sounded like TJ miller for a sec
He made the strongest bomb, and did it with style
Taylor Jason Martin Lisa Taylor Linda
Bro this is a copy of a video that a different youtuber did
bro Rick rolled us without rick roiing lol
46:18
0:07
42:25
Wait I think I remember watching those domino videos 🥹🙏
Ngl for how big the build up was, it would have been nice to see more of the aftermath or even know if Wunba actually survived the blast
Actually, did he survive?
Can we see the aftermath?
And rhen the comouter crashes
I bet the PC is gonna turn into a nuke
Liked at the Rick-Roll
10:00 whispering all items except black concrete, like bro readead out loud Black 😭🙏
The firework pattern almost gave me a heartattack 41:44
Hey love from India can please dub your voice in Hindi for Indian audience ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Of course I got rickrolled
Does bro have a NASA PC
so disapointed ! no explosion wtf !
What old motherboard did you have so i onow not to buy it lol
Imagine a creeper set off the TNT shortly before he could finish
man feels cringe al the way through
Again, in English please
Well, that was a pointless waste of time
Wunba you thought you could hide a rick roll 😂
Hey be careful because selling them posters with an extra reward is considered an illegal lottery and it's illegal unless there's a way to obtain one for free
Omg it was a whole project! Wonderful! Thanks so much for this video
Man rickrolled more than 5 million people
During the items for ten storage part the yellow text says "never gonna give you up"
Truly impressive
It's late so I hope my math is mathing   You set of 2.421 megetons of boom boom Or something that is nearly two and a half the size of the W-59 thermonuclear warhead.  And twice as large as the B83 thermonuclear bomb, which are commissioned to be used to knock an asteroid off course if it has an imminent Earth impact.   You released  51,969,464 gigajoules of energy.  Or roughly enligh gigajoules to power the entire United States for 4.4 hours given their current usage. (This includes all major users including industry plants, military bases, etc)   Or there are roughly 145,000,000 residential homes in the US.  The average monthly usage of E is 870 kwh.    To calculate how long 51,969,464 GJ would power 145,000,000 homes that each consume 870 kWh per month, we can break it down into the following steps:  Step 1: Convert the average energy consumption per home to joules.  Each home consumes 870 kWh per month. Since 1 kWh = 3.6 × 10⁶ joules:  870 kWh x 3.6 x 10⁶ joules/kWh = 3.132 x 10⁹ joules/month per home      Step 2: Calculate the total monthly energy consumption for 145,000,000 homes.  For 145,000,000 homes, the total energy consumption per month is:  145,000,000 x 3.132 x 10⁹ joules/home = 4.5414 x10¹⁷  joules/month    Step 3: Convert 51,969,464 GJ to joules.  Since 1 GJ = 10⁹ joules: 51,969,464 GJ = 51,969,464 x 10⁹ joules = 5.1969 x 10¹⁶ joules   Step 4: Calculate how many months of energy this amount would supply.  To find out how long the 51,969,464 GJ would last for the 145 million homes, divide the total energy available by the total monthly consumption:  5.1969 x 10¹⁶ joules __________________ 4.5414 x 10¹⁷ joules/ month   ≈ 0.1144 months    Step 5: Convert months to days.  Since 1 month is approximately 30 days: 0.1144 months x 30 days/month = 3.43 days   Therefore, that blast of 51,969,464 GJ would power 145,000,000 US homes that average 870 kWh per month for about 3.4 days.
That was the worst setup for little explosion, what a waste.
lil bro thought he could sneak in a rick roll 😭🙏🙏
Holy shit, I'm not a subscriber, and I don't know you, BUT I do remember watching those domino videos!
Bro literally ricked rolled us at 44:18
32:36
41:16:what does that have to do with you using an alt?
35:00:bro TNT cant Break obbsidian
Idc what anyone says ever, you are LITERALLY THE BEST Minecrafter EVER BRO! This was SO SICK to watch! So PEAK, FR like I dont even know what to type so imma juss say that. Thank you Wunba my new Minecraft hardcore goat! big ups and huge W man like wtf!
Trash video, even trashier ending
narrating it all kinda kills the vibe y know
Around 23:30 i thought i heard jort storm
Omg i wonder what the song will be. What a massive mystery
hold on if he has been in this world for a long time how is he only at level 11000 when in another video thats a year ago he is at 13000
Nuclear nukes are better 51 megatons came from a test with hydrogyn its to powerfull so it will not be better
I’m not even mad about the rickroll at 44:05 because it’s honestly such a vibe.
Yeah, dude you got a faulty intel CPU
I don't even watch minecraft videos, but that was amazing. Thank you sir, great content.
44:06 to 44:27 rickroll bruh why
This video almost made him 	delete his channel
Make a giant tnt bomb that is stronger than the tsar bombar
0:15 step one is to get a pc that won’t explode first
Why do you minecraft hardcore player span months on a project in a video that's one hour long. And then the end result is shown for only 10 secons I realy realy dont get that
Everybody who sees this subscribe for his months of hard work
did bro survive, i watched the video, but i dont recall them saying or showing if they survived
I fast forward to the last 30 seconds
fua
10:15 Fr
good nice😍😍
i have a skulk stronghold in one world, and half the end portal room is destroyed and its floating because it got completely glitched
Well it depends what way you calculate it but i calculated that to make it as strong as average nuke you need 2b tnt
read all the orange text (10:02)
that was a big boi blast
34:46 At this point you are just containing SCP-106 lol
bro rickrolled us
How do i play on your world :)
How do you drop all the items in chest in one seccond
Blud fr had to rick rolled us just before his world blows up
I hope u also make dominoes again
i really like the end and now can we see the world after the explosion
You can just use a turtle shell
im now a tnt
The 💥 like hiroshima😢😢😢
MY PCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC

Broo he is crazyyyyyyy😂😂😂😂
How do you keep all those chunk's loaded being far away from them in minecraft vanilla, because all those farms in different places and the ender teleport trick you use will not work if the chunk is not loaded....
Bros never heard of backing up his files
How can a world record count when you have mods???
Why didnt you do this in creative 😂
the best video i've seen so far in youtube
Bro broke his pc 💀twice💀
66 BLOCKS PER SECOND?
So, that is in kilotons, the tsar bomba is 50 megatons, which is 50000 stronger than a kiloton, yep we built that pocket sun.
Does anyone know what song plays at 22:44?
Hoppers😂
Love the subtle Rick Roll. XD
Bro you rick rolled us
There was just entirely too much effort put into this video and as such there's NO WAY I could not sub. This was amazing! Thank you for the hard work and I look forward to seeing what kind of madness you'll cook up next!!
The auto crafter came a few months late for him
The dedication to continue, the journey for the boom.... Respect
Did you save your world download again?
can't accept being rickrolled by Wunba
bro farmed 5.3m sans 💀
Why not use an auto builder mod if you also use a mod for crafting
Bruh not the rick roll XD
He Rick rolled me 😂
The math only checks out if a 1m*1m*1m block of tnt is energetically equivalent to a block of tnt the same size in real life. When the game was made the power of TNT was given arbitrary numbers for the blast radius and power. Some nerds somewhere on the internet figured out that 1 block of tnt is equivalent to 4.2 megajoules and that is equivalent to about 1kg of TNT IRL. So going by this math Wunba would have to make the TNT 1650 times bigger to get the energetic equivalent of a nuke. That said, even what he did was insanity. He made all these machines to streamline TNT production and made the volumetric equivalent of TNT as a whole ass nuke. In hardcore mode nonetheless. What he made is a very good representation of how big a cube of TNT would have to be in real life for it to have the same power as a nuke. Would be interesting to see this blow up if there was a mod installed that made each block of tnt 1650 times more powerful so it really is equivalent to a nukes worth of TNT.
Litteraly impossible that he places manually 1300000 tnt  juste placing it woule talk alone 15 day without doing anything else
haven't finished the vid, but im guessing the song is a rickroll Edit: okay ig youtubers are just too predictable
how did you got from the world border to your spawn? when your elytra's are broken
you need a nasa pc  my computer  cant even handle that
Bro rick rolled us in a world record way😂😂😂😂😂
I have been thinking about what to say and how, and here it is: this would have been insane if you had used creative, and then fact that you DIDN'T makes it unbelievable. I would NEVER have believed that someone had done this in minecraft if this video didn't exist. This is beyond all logic and reason! It is so incredible, it's hard to comprehend. This is so amazing, it makes me think "amazing what humans can achive." It makes me philosophical! Eternal honor to you!! :D
I played Minecraft when it first came out, and after 1 hour I was bored senseless! However, at least you did something very interesting!  This was quite good, a Domino rally and an EXPLOSION! Most Minecraft uploaders just do boring crap or make stupid skits that aren't funny. The explosion wasn't as big as I expected, but that aftermath is epic! You actually made Minecraft play Rick Astley, well done!
Mathematically correct nuke in minecraft, you say? ;)
wait... so we don't get to see the crater?
why did you waste all that time instead of just using commands
In 6 months bro earned 400,000 subs
HOW ARE YOU PLACING SEVERAL BLOCKS PER TICK (ALSO WHAT AUTOCLICKER ARE YOU USING)
13:35 where tf did you get that number from
What a sigma
Hey man. this is my first time seeing your channel and I just wanted to say how impressed I am by your utmost dedication, patience and persistence in your video creation. I also can tell, you are an extraordinary person who's vibes are a pleasure to witness. personally im not interested in Minecraft, but the sheer time you put into the content and editing should be greatly applauded and every one of your subscribers are lucky to have found you. Keep working hard bother!
50 minutes of absolutely nothing. Nobody believes you that this is a hardcore world
I just got Rick rolled
I KNEW IT 44:05
Why is the end sad😢
Only what i do in real life!!!
Does it have highlight copy and paste yet?
44:05 music
Dude if I build that tent on my lap top my game would lag me out so bad!
Dophins breathe air just like we do... maybe he died of dehydration from the sun?
Your calculations are by comparing the volumetric equivalent... but are minecraft TNT equivalent to the explosive power of IRL TNT? I think we need damage calculations to know if it is as dense and effective as the real stuff... what if MC TNT is more (or less) effective for balanced gameplay purposes? 🤔
He said he might lose his heart core world but he Could have lost it twice
17:16 Bro got Electrified
i literally got chills watching that go off
What
Bro. That's a lot.
Rip pc 2 times
or could've used creative.
King sammalot jazzy juice 🥤
Ive always hated how it cant just be one big explosion
little did he know that stacking those domines was just his canon event......  24:25
Does he actually need help
but did you survive?
no way he rickrolled us on a GUINESS WORLD RECORD
17:17 WHAT KIND OF AN AUTO CLICKER DOES THAT?
the BEST thing EVER someone DID in The MINECRAFT (that was a bit dramatic) 45:03
i cant beliave im seeing this
42:15 YoUr S0 S1biDI, Your S0 Ph4anT0m T4X
I felt illegal watching this for free
The chanel named beebuyog (i came across it accidentally hes a philipino btw but the content is one of yhe best and hes funny) played on 2b2t but no way you rickroll us
your world shouldn’t be gone if it’s connected to a microsoft account….
Poor little chiken, in the activator minecart. R.I.P.
NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP
NO WAY BRO RICKROLLED US AT 44:20
lol nice try 10:06
Bruh
Is the pizzaman still waiting to deliver the food?
Bro made a new Nether biome
Not to be that person, but why didn't you back up your world at the very least after your PC died the first time?  .... or did you, and that was just to build up suspense lol
Back. Up.
R.i.p won
Question for the comment section to answer what is wunbas most placed block
the song was fire!!!!!!
I was not expecting to watch this entire video. That was amazing? I enjoyed every minute of it. Thanks
Show the fucking crater what the fuck did I watch this for
Hoopers hoppers
That’s a super big tnt area!
6:50 Seisure warning until 6:55

This has been an inspiring video. It left tears in my eyes.🫣🥹🥹👍👍👍👍👍
Did you live?
WTH happened to the totem at 42:58
32:38 censoring your toes is wild😂
Why WHY Why are we Rick rolled
nah his pc is gonna turn into the nuke
give me the schem
I just found this channel and your commitment is astounding. I thought at first this was all on creative, but hardcore mode? That's insane. I wish I found this channel before 1 mil!
Einfach Heiko im Video😂😂😂😂
biblically accurate TNT
Why does the way he says hoppers remind me of how the guy in the burger king commercial say whopper😂
love the dramatic parts great video
what auto clicker you use??
Bro rickrolled us in the best way😂😂
Why do you rickroll so much people at 44:05
That was a big blast it was soooo satesfying
Same
Rip the chicken he was legendary
u're a genius, period.
heeeeeyyyyyy wunbaaaaaaaa........ u have 1.4m subscribers now, you know what that meansssss >:)
Wunba said "so satisfying" a lot but then again it very much was
21:40 DONT BLOW UP THE DOLPHIN
That was possibly the biggest setup, for the worst payoff I have ever seen.  We barely fot to see the explosion.
I'm way late to this but I'd love to see a walkthtough of the aftermath 🥺
Did you say never going to give you up😂😂😂😂😂
10:25 rickroll😂😂😂😂
Rube Goldberg would be extremely proud of you.
Where is your bank account 🤣🤣🤣
WAs macht heiko da?
2:43 the worst part is I can't tell if this is a joke or not
Anyone see the hidden Rubik’s cube 4:30
44:09 bro Rick rolled us again
44:10 bro Rick rolled us
Nice one with music
how to download the world
Shame you don't get to watch anything get blown up really.
Yes
poor chicken
can you give your modes?
I’m sorry you were the domino dude I watch when I was a kid??
I don’t like how he showed us all the contraptions at the start of the video😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
If you put enderchest in ender chest you don't need to fly back and forth
What song plays around 11:53?
He needs help 2:43
is he dead?
minecraft is best game
Plot twist:Bro accidentally pulls out a flint while placing tnt.
I enjoyed A LOT watching this video (and you got a new subscriber, although I don't think that matters at this point lmfao)
Dunno why you wouldn't regularly backup your stuff anyways, but I bet you will in the future....
You've been beat. Just watched a video of 27,000,000 tnt.
10:08 Bro thought we wouldn't figure out he rickrooled us
Who has a YouTube channel with millions of subscribers and only ONE drive with your data on it?!
bro i got rick rolled LOL
Bruh 44:07
BRUH
What a survival overkill 35:35 😂
WE NEED TO KNOW IF U SURVIVED OR NOT BRUV
The chicken was like "why meee"
The freaking rick roll. Argh!
What a lame explosion.
And that is how you set off a nuke with a Rube Goldberg machine.
Is he trying to sound like Graystillplays? If so, he's 2.0!
Bro:"it's just a prank" "the prank"
Hell yeah button —>
Hell yeah…
Your voice is deeper on the video
W PIZZA MAN
bro really take month to rickroll us
Oppenheimer theme sits along well
This is why i stopped hardcore minecraft, too many sweats..    Feels appopriate watching this video when u have 1.3mil subs. almost 1.4 tho
Thy person dosenth realize thy bottom of said nuclear bomb is completely blocked from thee' persons infamous range of view?
that plot twist was INSANE
Wooow a huge explosion :D😊😊😊😊😊
new sub
watching this made me realize that minecraft is mostly like a program than a game
Imagine accidentally activate one TNT prematurely 😢
13:45 "nukelar" ffs
R.I.P. to all the mobs that sacrificed their lives to blow it up, especially the chicken in the minecart that drove into the explosion.
The game is gonna crash man
2:57 your not oppenhimer little bro
Bi
How I knew it will be a rickroll🤣
Wow that's so scary. Probably one of the scariest things you could experience.
13:25   2421 kilotons weighs 5,337,391,367.5 pounds
45:21 explode it 😂 Edit wow 1 likes
For every like I eat 1 calorie
Wunba: Worried about losing the world Whatever mod he uses for the camera: "Lag? I don't even know her!"
the rick roll was crazy lol
9:50 dementia simulator
Did you rickroll over 5 million people
bro widows just gave up and went to bios
Im glad you have a successful channel but this was so much build up for an explosion that was almost invisible. It just looked like they disappeared
Imagine the giant tnt explosion on Nintendo switch. The switch will be fried or it will explode
wait why is 18:41 showing a CRYzen (ryzen) 9 and in 18:45 it states its a Intel i9-14900k ?!?!?!?!
Hey dude could you tell me how you fixed the PC because mine is doing the same thing and I can't find a single tortorial on how to fix it
13:47  i bet its gonna- EUDHCJDSUCHWCWIDFHFUCJWNCI1JDJDJDJEJDIFEJWJ
The totem was blinking

Who heard the "never gonna"?
Dang this took that long
10:02 never gonna give you up
coba 1.500.000 TNT
at exactly 8 minutes we can see that the portal whas lit while he told us that it was not. which meens that there is something going on in the video that we don't know about.
I am so glad I spipped tothend for you to not show us the explosion
Sb737 big fan
I never thought I’d say this, but I think I stumbled upon a career professional solo minecrafter
Hi
Can I be in one of your videos plz
17:16
😢 10:02 10:26
Hello jason
You are telling me this dude does not have any backups on a different pc/server/drive? Im gonna have a stroke

My guy please keep a backup on a hard drive
44:10 why a rickroll
U dear Rik roll this video 📷😎😂😂😂😎😎😁💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣😼😼😼💣🌎💣🌎💣🌎🎮🎮
Yeah,exploding that many TNT can be made the PC into a freaking nuke.
Bro, why does he have fire by the netherportals..
WHY DID YOU RICK ROLL US TWICE!!???
Bro what was the mod that made the totem blink
If you go to 4:03 seconds you can see the totem blink.

24:18 This part is legendary
Wow congrats for your subscribers was it worth it?
No way while I was watching this I really just got Rick rolled lol
PURPUR
Bro Rick rolled me 44:11
fire the editor
Fake, you already tested it beforehand, and in this video you're acting as if it's the first time you ran it. You must think we're all a bunch of 12 year old gullible republican kids. 🤣
is there a place we can go to to watch the full footage? Y'know, to make sure its not faked
Why didnt u do it underground? The damage would have been bigger.
that was mind blowingdo it again at 2 million plz
I did not expect to get rickrolled😂😂😂
BRO did not just rickroll EVERYONE44:00
...
Once my computer froze while I was looking trough a cap cut recording of among us that I was gonna edit and post my computer was froze for like 5 hours my computer is an old cromebook
For tnt to be the equivalent of the tzar or tsar bomba it would have to have 65 million tnt.
18:43 You do not want RAM this slow on a machine with a 5950x. Btw 19:43 I'm pretty sure that Samsung has at least a 2 year warranty, that was very unlucky.
👑👏👏👏 incredible
Please go to sleep for one month you need it for all these Minecraft videos please rest
Rick Roll 👇👍
Sadness from inside out of Riley started gambling: 45:30
You can use torches for the sand chain reaction so you don’t need to close all the signs
Let's perform some quick calculations. I know, Math, but stay with me on this one.  Performing very rough calculations, we can make an estimate on how destructive such a TNT colossus would be, by using the formula  NOTE: Commas are used for easy reading, dots are used at the start of decimals  Amount of blocks in m³ × density adjusted for t/m³ × Energy Released adjusted to PJ and rounded to 3 decimals  1,331,000×(1.654÷100^(3)× 1,000^(2))×4.184 ÷100^(3)  = 9.211PJ  9.211PJ ≈ 2.2Mt of TNT is a monstrous amount of energy and what is concidered a large thermonuclear weapon and roughly equal to the Mark 15 ( 1.7–3.8 Mt, 1955–1965)  Here are some interesting facts:  All numbers in meters  Fatal Distance	300.18 Lung Damage	475.76 Eardrum Rupture	1223.34  Houses completely demolished	624.28  Houses badly damaged, beyond repair, require demolition	923.42  Houses rendered uninhabitable, can be repaired with extensive work	1612.73  Houses rendered uninhabitable, can be repaired reasonably quickly	2770.26  Houses require repairs, serious inconvenience but remain habitable	5540.51  Maximum Effected Range	47463.67 (feeling vibrations)

Datart (Slovakian electronics retailer) shutdown experience - Minecraft Wunba's chain reaction and giant TNT explosion POV (only toppling part)
The next Oppenheimer 💀💀
Well youre at 1.3 mil now so its accurate
You used to do dominoes. Now you're doing a dominoes-like thing in Minecraft, that orders a pizza... from Dominos Pizza.
What the hell why didn’t u show the aftermath and why was it so dark?!? Why didn’t u show the pov from your character in the obsidian cave?? Why wasn’t the whole explosion visible in one clear uncut clip!???  Why didn’t u put the “cameras” closer to the explosion? (There was clear space)  Why do you make so much extreme effort to then only show 30 sec of the main explosion??!  Why didn’t u made a time labs about the loading of the crater if it  took 90 min?  And again why the hell did u make it so damn dark my god?!?  What a waste of effort and video editing   Im not hating but the end was hella disappointing dude
Now we need to know how wide the crater was
Absolute cinema🔥
45:22 when it blows up
Nah rasplin stole your idea😭
Wow i would not have thought that a German Youtuber (Castcrafter) would be setting a wr

The Oppenheimer reference I have became death the destroy of worlds is great

With your yob you should do Daily Backups on an Nas and to an Cloud Storage 😅
Question. Could you hook up hoppers to your ender chest with a chunk loader on the farm side, them have an ender chest on the drop off side you could continuously empty out because it’s being filled from the farm side (chunk loaded side)?
41:05 two wunbas🤔🤔
Wunba: Thinks that he made the most tnt activated  The tnt flat world: Say less
He got me with the rick roll

what is the marble game he did in the begining of explosion
That was soo awesome!
Ah yes, the best way to end your Minecraft world is by dropping a marble down a track in real life that activates some magnet cannons that sends a bunch of marbles down a path to activate some mechanisms that let them continue and eventually toppling a line of dominoes that go small to large and release a mug that sends another marble that sends a roll of toilet paper that drops a spatula sending yet another marble that topples another line of dominoes that goes small to large again and pulls a domino out and drops a lever onto the spacebar causing your Minecraft player to jump and activate a tripwire that activates a repeater line that retracts a piston that updates a long tower of sand and gravel that falls onto a minecart that activates a chain of pistons that activate some beacons and activates a redstone torch tower that activates a bunch of pistons to drop a ton of dripstone spikes onto a tripwire that activates a minecart sending it through an old-school roller coaster where it eventually falls onto a detector rail that sends a creeper onto a pressure plate that drops stacks of anvils sending an item through a water tube that eventually drops onto a pressure plate that shoots arrows from a dispenser that hit a target block that activates a minecart wave machine with the last minecart moving forwards onto a railway and allowing a cactus to grow up and activate a chain of observers and doors that activate a redstone lamp that triggers an AutoHotkey program scanning the entire screen for a pixel of the exact color of a lit redstone lamp that moves the mouse to another screen to order a pizza whose delivery man topples over a line of Domino's that go small to large yet again causing a lever to hit the W key causing the Minecraft player to move forwards onto two slime launchers and fall onto two slime trampolines and land on a pressure plate that causes a villager to move over to a bed and step on another pressure plate that retracts a piston causing an inverted pyramid of concrete powder to fall that activates firework dispensers which are heard by a sculk sensor that activates dispensers that fire chicken eggs until one lands on a pressure plate that puts some water onto a lavacast that activates some note blocks then pushes a tower of boats into a pit until eventually itr eaches the top boat that activates a tripwire that dispenses a minecart so the player can take a trip around their world one last time before it returns and retracts a piston so a frog can eat a magma cube and drop a froglight that goes into a hopper that activates a piston chain that pushes a netherite armor stand on a path of ice that plays Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up on note blocks and extends a piston that activates a conduit that kills a drowned whose drops are put into hoppers that activate a comparator that sends a minecart to explode a literal nuke's worth of TNT.
It was really crazy
99% of wunba's building montages are microwaves
is no one gonna talk abt the fact that he rickrolled us 2 times ( 6 months ago today )
Rickroll 44:08
Not only I saw a massive explosion, but I also got rick-rolled. Peak Youtube.

I’m gonna jump one time every like this video game not actually one jump. I’m gonna do five jumps every single like 20 push-ups. I also changed it to push-ups but like I’ll do 20 push-ups for you.
If you’re into your world, make mine creative and then I’ll just help you with everything you need full stacks of everything you need so you won’t have to do a lot of hard things and I could help you. I would be so clearly if you like some bedrock or something I could get it to you or if you needed to get some stuff, just ask me and I could be some of your videos like my skin only my skin would probably be Steve but I would quickly buy a cool skin, especially like my other skin and my skin is cool creeper actually I could get a mod and add it to your old and then and then you could have another modern year old we could add Tetris mod  so you could be Zeus in the cloud light like everywhere
“Why do I have an extra tnt”

Why is the totem blinking
Did anyone else notice he said never gonna give you up
Bro rickrolled us 💀
44:08 Never thought I'd be rick rolled in minecraft by a video of a nuke. I'm not even mad, just impressed and hope it was worth it.
10:03 asmr moment😂
6:18 backflip☠️
44:47 - This felt like a minecraft  movie straight to the very end of the video to me, I love it.
Respect for the delivery guy, without him we wouldn’t be able to see this.

He has became death destroyer of worlds
39:33  about here the totem in his hand blinks
Jesus Christ loves you

Hoppers hoppers hoppers hoppers hoppers hoppers hoppers hoppers hoppers hoppers hoppers
44:05 why rickrolling me bruh-
Did he survive? You’ll never know!!!
19:49 to 20:10 that scared me o_o
Rick roll seriously 44:19
Bro rickrolled us in the Most creative way ever
44:45 You Rick room me! 😡😡😡
Subscribers-Have you heard of thing called a life?     Wunba-What’s a life?
I'm at the start so perhaps this is already mentioned somewhere, but there's a record that cannot be broken regarding this if you want to experiment. Just generate a world made of only TNT, that's literally an infinite megaton explosion. I did this once, can't load into the continually exploding world to this day. 🤷‍♂️🤣
Did you survive?
I literally died
SO MUCH RICK ROLL
yeah but didnt 90% of the tnts explode in the air?
I can't believe you did all that for us 😊
Did he just Rick Role us?
i wish you sucseed and this video dosent get copyrighted
Is someone gonna talk about how he rickrolled us
did you also put blast protection on your armor
imagine uttering "villager breeder" near a victorian child
Wow
Whos bragging about an auto crafter anymore?
that chicken will be remembered, name him bert the bird and add a sign somewhere
It's only because he nearly lost his entire work I feel so bad even though I had nothing to do with it I feel bad for him😢😢😢
😢😢😢😢😢 I feel so sad for him
13:04 -- I realised that Wunba used the Oppenheimer Soundtrack. This movie strangely is devoted to him.
LMAO to your editor!
36:38  why didn't you use height tiles instead of tilting?
36:11  GRAVITRAX XX XX very underrated  I CANT EXPLAIN HOW OBSESSED I WAS WITH THAT I KNOW EVERY PIECE (ask me to verify)
Did anyone realise the totem of undying blinking?!?!
Why were you in the farlands?
If you look carefuly the totem blinked
:)
Such a cool video
Wunba you cheated 😢😢😢
Omg omg
Omg
I just noticed there is a village right next to the nuke so I have to say RIP Village
Did the totem.... blink?
45:20 the MOMENT the 1st TNT block was lit my oven timer went off for my baked Mac and cheese.  Impeccable :)
32:39 what he sencoring 🤨😳
10:02 Did anyone notice his secret message?
Wtf is a potato pc
All of this is.. virtual?..
10:13 bro just Rick rolled us lol
10:03 My fav asmr channel

Editing is top notch
10:13 WHY
I got rickroll
I wouldve cried if thus happened to me also nice rickroll
45:31 ITS DISSOLVING
Drop the 90 mine video of the tnt going off 🙏😭
I was listening to The End by The Beatles when the final detonation process, I got chills to say the least. Congrats on 1 mil! <3
I I think I know how he crash Minecraft. he was tooooo fast to crash and block placing
12secs for recap
I just noticed the massive tnt block is right next to a village.
He just rick rolled us 💀 44:02
We all got Rick rolled
Troppling 11:50 min
just how much Adderall was needed for this video exactly?
???????
R.I.P chicken
11:40 “just a little bit"
44:05 Bro really rickrolled me
Try 1,000,000,000,000 tnt Plssssssssssssssssssss
I knew it was gonna be rick roll from the very start
Bro made a teleport machine or something when he could’ve just used the shurkle boxes in shurkle boxes 5:00
how do you have that many shulkers?!?!?!?!
The part where he said he hope his video doesn't get copyrighted two of my videos did
Bro the 45:01 bomb looked so intimidating
?????
I thought he Rick rolled us and he was never gonna explode the tnt
i remember watching wunba's old dominoes videos when i was really young
Block of tnt in hardcore (」°ロ°)」ᴺᴼ in creative mode yes
It really makes me mad that motherboard manufacturers keep pushing voltage for whatever minute performance advantage, not thinking about how it affects consumers when components start failing. Even Intel is doing it with their own chips.
I subscribed
44:00
So you made a rube Goldberg machine?
26:55    How is that song called?  I remember listening to it a few years ago but i cant remember the name.
Bro is Oppenheimer
RickRoll

Bro all that and u didn’t even show what happened a few seconds after the blast this has gotta be a joke 😭literally would of been the same if you set it off alone and then just posted a pic of the aftermath Wtf was that man
Bro we got Rick rolled
Just to visualize the size of a 2421KT(2.4MT) nuke if it was airblasted over new york at 1650ft or 503m would have the lightest affect (direct, non fallout) travel all the way do Edison, New brunswick (in New Jersey) (thats 40.5km or 25.1 miles) and cover an area of over 5150 SqKm or 3200 SqMi fallout would travel about 310km or (thats all the way to New Midway, near fredrick in Maryland) at 12mph 192.6 mi or in other words the fallout would travel a horizontal distance that would span more than some entire states like (but not limited to), Massachuesets, Rhode Island, Delaware, Conneticut and more (I know this because of a website called nuke map it lets you try different nuke yields of upto 100MT (100.000KT)
To be honest I hardly ever watch Minecraft videos, but holy this was an amazing experience. You just got a new subscriber!
I hope that you'll make as many backups as humanly possible from now on. Like Jesus fckn christ, that was close .____. Good thing that everything is ok now, but that was TOO CLOSE
bruh 44:07
Note: the tnt that was exploded was around 20 million times more powerful than a single normal TNT.
Oppenheimmer ❌ Wunbaheimmer ✅                 btw you deserve a like and a sub :)
rest in peace to that one chicken that started the explosion
Sooo does he still have his world ?????

Watching you build this TNT was just so nostalgic… Everyone must’ve tried building a huge TNT block back in the day…
Wow you set this record on my birthday😮🎉🙂

24:28 Mogswamp #2!?
If his pc can’t handle a motherboard, how will it handle 1,356,826,825,725,936,925,357,720,027,620,536 blocks of tnt?
32:40 : hopefully this video doesn't get cooy righted i spent too much time for it to be copy righted Me: your video was copy righted BY ME!😈     Also thank you pizza man! For helping him with his big project
I didn't expect a Rick Roll on the last one
I'm very confident you could've cut 43 minutes out of this video and it would've still hit 5m. The buildup was really unnecessary.
man is a minecraft youtuber commenting on a minecraft youtuber?
10:05 bro i just got rickrolled in the best way possible ☠️☠️☠️
bro just rickrolled us in minecraft
that was awsome. it shows engineering. continue the great work! if you want..

He is the luckiest man alive😮😮😮😮
10:03 Buddy really rick rolled us 😂😂
every time he screams in agony it skips to an ad
why did he spend soooo long on the chain thing and didn’t show the full aftermath of the explosion or it blowing up? i would’ve enjoyed seeing it without the cinematic stuff he put
44:07 WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
this vid took a turn so fast
Biblically accurate tnt
Who's gonna tell bro that kilotons is a measurement of explosive energy, not weight lmao
Pov : You wasted your HUNDREDS of hours HUNDREDS of dollars but i just wasted my 46:20 seconds😂

130x more powerful than the first atomic bomb was ever created. IMPRESSIVE
45:13 is the countdown until the nuke goes, don’t thank me.
BBBBBRRRRRUUUUHHHHHH GGGUUUYYYSSSS THE MUSIC THINGY BUILD HE MADE WAS THE MUSIC OF RICK ROLL SO WE ALL GOT RICK ROLLED XD CD CD XD THATS WHY HE SAID IT MIGHT GET HIM COPYRIGHTED
this was fucking awesome lol
Rick roll really.  🤨
how dear u
*casually glazes past 143 beacons*
1 cubic meter of real life tnt's explosive power does not compare to that of 1 block of minecraft tnt's explosive power at all.
A wise man once said "its not the bomb that'll blow up its the pc" *by litteraly no one*
Insane project. This game is awesome.
Under one hour
W wunba, W Jason
We got rickrolled
where i can download this map?
1,00kiloton=1mt so that is have 2.3mt😮
I knew it was going to be a rick roll
2 rickrolls one video is crazy
Wait Did I get secretly Rick rolled?
I never respected so much a youtuber but this guy
Such a shit video😂😂😂😂😂
Ehat a terrible video. All this buildup for absolutely nothing. Thanks for wasting my time.
bro not that song
clap ball
wunba this is actual insanity my guy how haven't i seen this video yet
44:17  did I just seriously watch all this stuff with all the insane buildup accusing you of being a brainrotten zoomie (kinda contradictionary) only to get rickrolled? worth it. good job bro.
9:58 bro rickrolled us in the most hidden way in the entire world
The video crashed my iPad so I’m on my pc but… I REALY like the video and I hope you did not lose the hardcore world ps subscriber
damn the hidden rickroll is crazy
Oh god… you’re gonna destroy your hard drive!
Oh also you’re at 1.3 million right now subscribers so😂
4:05 totem of undying blinks 💀💀💀
Hey wunba can u tell me how to get the blueprint thing hwere u can build ur stuff with it i want to test it in my hardcore world
"i am become death, destroyer of the world"is CRAAZZZYYY💀
Ngl I thought it would be Rick roll
29:18

Amazing video bro ❤.Respect!
We got ricrolled twice in this video...
I knew the Rick roll from the start
You rickrolled me 💀
And then a creeper explodes-
44:14 i really got rickrolled?
The dedication that has been put into this video is unreal...
We got rickrolled
The totem blinked??????? 7:50
He just rick roll us while he said the item he said 6 thing. He said "never-gonna-give-you-up"
ok that rickroll was random
13:40 131x if we include your pc
12:41 time for me to straight up triple that record
i see, so your tnt is 112x112x112, since your tnt uses 1331000 tnt, the cube root of that is 110, adding 1 block on each side for the cover.
Me Thinking he was gonna mine all the sand 💀💀
Oh no we got rickrolled
The fact that he rickrolled us after 40 minutes of video is insane
Just make a super flat world with only tnt then explode it your game will crash I did it once and my pc almost exploded
I feel so bad for you destroying your hardcore world
This is genuinely the best minecraft video i have seen on youtube. It is so creative and clearly emotionally significant, and as someone who has been a fan for over a year, I really appreciate the videos that you make.
wow, we saw way less of the bomb explode than i thought, also. Did your char survive? was the chamber damaged at all?
0:57 How did you make that list? Is it a mod? 3:59 an autocrafter? isn't this a vanilla world? I am very confused
Overprotective
AMASING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

4:51 rail way where you can put a lot of chest minecarts, fill them up and send them away.
I feel like his pc would create a bigger explosion than any nuclear bomb
This is the most impressive Minecraft video I have ever seen, far beyond any others. Truly mind-blowing.
You guys would get the same effect doing this in creative mode...
44:08 I realized it too late...

why does he need to do the outer casing for the floor face?
Are you doing what I think your doing with that whispers
The B83 nuclear warhead (USA's strongest nuclear bomb)was half the power of this tnt explosion.
12:54 are you using world edit? Bc you have a wooden axe, why would you want a wooden axe if you already have a netherite axe?
Anybody else notice that at 10:03 he gave us a hint to what the note block song was
There is no way you rickrolled us
I respect you and everything you did, this is history forever😊

DID YOU SURVIVE THE BIG BOOM?
TOTEMS BLINK?

Did you die?
Is anyone else now kinda curious about this guy's SAT score
*cough*backups*cough* ;p
The explosion is more powerful than the US's most powerful bomb, which is 1.2 megatons of TNT. You built the TNT equivalent to the power of 2.421 megatons of tnt, which is twice as powerful!
are you rick rolled
this was so awesome and I loved this video so much

What is your other channel called?
Don't buy American Megatrends. They're ... not great
My i9-13900KS fried 3 new NVME SSDs before I gave up on it. These i9-13k and 14k are definitely breaking disks.
WO
I cant imagine how you sleep at night
How did he get an alt account in the world if it's "Hardcore". Yeah, there's no way it was actually hardcore mode after this
I knew we would get rickrolled
not even close to world record
You must not lose hope
Why were you holding a wooden axe craft were you cheating in Minecraft
You're so dead
10:03 HOW DARE YOU RICK ROLL ME IN A MONTAGE 😢
🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨🧨
I can’t believe you did this for your subs
Are you dumb
This is a story of adventure heartbreak triumph and success
U rickrolled me
You stole a video from carvs
i set this video as my animated backround
That earned u a sub that was amazing
I will do 200 push ups for each like
I'm sorry did that totem of undying just blink??
Let's just actually think about how much this man has went through in Minecraft. His grinds are dedicated no joke
Oh man, you're the dude that did the Space in 15,000 Domino's? Fuck yeah, I remember watching that video, it was so cool.
No uranium nor any other heavy element. Not accurate
Not enough
no i have 1190x more than that
45:38  It exploded ❌ It evaporated ✔
You this guys deserve more likes then MrBeast

31:20
Type F to pay respects 🫡                                👇
This sucked
I make A tiny tent  explosion and it laged
What auto clicker do you use
What a fraking riiiiide!
Did you die
This video has so many layers that I don’t even know what to comment about
The whole "data loss" issue is why you back up your worlds and stuff to external storage on a regular basis, especially for big projects like this.
I literally watched for 45 minutes for the sole purpose of seeing the explosion(s) and after effects and you included neither. Entertaining otherwise but a major disappointment and for that, a thumbs down
did anyone notice the never gonna give you up when he was collecting items for the storage for the sand in orange
Did you eat the pizza?
the casual rickroll
CastCrafter mentioned 🗣️
Have you done a face reveal
Till this day the delivery-man is still standing at Wunba's window.
17:10 was just a military anti air machine gun
13:10
I will be totally honest with you buddy but Minecraft is not my type of game to watch but this is definitely worth a like true dedication congratulations on the million subscribers you definitely work a lot harder than 90% of YouTubers just on this video
One of the most insane video I’ve ever seen.
Computer was nuked during production of nuke
Specially thanks for subtitles! Easy to watch even I native speaker.  Really enjoyed watching))
Hey man, definitely use Raid1 on your important drives, so they're not likely to fail together, and also have a regular backup strategy. There are some automated tools for it too. Mc saves don't take up much Google drive or backblaze space
What if you (for the gunpowder) made shulker boxes, full of shulker boxes, full of shulker boxes, so on until you have an inventory of shulker box-ception full of gun powder
10:04-10:13 😂
Bro has the biggest YouTuber celebration ever than all YouTubers
Random friend: what’s the craziest thing you’ve ever done in your hardcore Minecraft world? Wumba: I fried my pc placing 66 blocks of tnt per second. It happened 2 times. (crickets chirping in the background)
Who are you mrbeast wtf
I knew it would be a rickroll the moment you called it tried to keep it secret
GHG
44:11 bruh i got rickrolled
This was a really fun video to watch  Matter of fact  It blew my mind
Why would you bother making the conduits when you could have jjst gotten the turtle shell helmet?

Just wanna say the rickroll meme has been dead for like 2 years.
2421kt of democracy*
Bro thinks he's Oppenheimer
Anyone else get jumpscared by the Jort Storm backing track 😅 I forgot it’s just something off of epidemic sounds for a while
This is awesome. And also I'm noticing Lord of the Rings books at 37:07 and 37:12
hoppers hoppers hoppers whoppers
I've been binging these videos for like 3 days now, and I like how in every video, there's a little short lesson or insightful soap box you add-- it helps me in my own creative motivation too.
Watching and seeing for the first time at 1.31M subs 👀
At the music part, did we just get rick rolled?
You wouldn't tell us a lie and dessert us, would you?
Props to you for all the fun animations in this video.
10:06 did no one notice the "you" he whispers 😢😂
2 ender chests, one inventory. One chest is for putting stuff in at the input the other one is for taking it out. PS inventory space
Wumba  casually Rick rolling us 😂
Love the edits
Imagine dying juat before blowing it up
I used to watch your dominoes video it’s what got me into making designs with dominoes now I’m watching your Minecraft videos to get motivation to build stuff in Minecraft crazy lol
bro I don’t normally like videos, but damn ts deserved one
The way the wave goes in the last 30 seconds of the video looks awesome. It looks like smoke. On a side note, did you win the record?
Bro he did this on my birthday
Bruh rick roll 10:02   Read the yellow letters
"So we literally can get Dominoes from Minecraft" ~Wunba 2024

Yooooo wtf? You didnt show the aftermath. You took 30 sec of zoomed in footage. I clicked on here for the destruction in the title not the long build up just to see almost nothing.
waitttttttttt....you were the one with the dominoes i'd always watch??????
Most tnt exploded in minecraft? doubt. on my first server I did a good 23,000,000 tnt and crashed the server lmao
44:00 i got rick rolled😭😭😭
Him talking by the tnt. Creeper sneeks right from behind him and explodes it all

Also w Domino’s both of them😂 40:06
That poot village got bombed to nothing
average wunba shower thoughts:
Why is the dislike to like ratio on this so high?
FOILED AGAIN!!! Why did you censor your feet at 32:40 😭
This video is insane. I don’t know how you spent SO much time doing this… all that TNT lol. This was also kinda like a documentary in a way, lots of ups downs.
World edit left the chat
Bro is a real engineer

"storage card" holy shit i hate kids so much ITS A FUCKING SSD
The Rickroll
Bro its so funny that while he was getting the items for the sand storage system he said "never gonna give you up" 10:00
Best potion effect (round 2)
We need to know...WHAT PIZZA DID YOU GET?
In short, this is a series of how you collected a thing to build a thing so you can farm a thing, to have enough things to build another thing to do a thing that you promised to do because your channel got so many things.
He tried and failed to rick roll me
funny enough as Im watching this video now and currently he has 1.3 Mil subs so that amount of tnt was correct
I have to say that my favorite part was the toilet  paper unrolling
Best rube goldburg machine
Building the TNT was pretty cool. But all the chain reaction stuff was waaaaay too extra for me. I would've just went right to it exploding (which we barely even got to see), then surveying the aftermath (which we barely got to see).
This video predicted how many subscribers he has as of now
I'm in the time when he actually has 1.3m hahaahahahahahhahahaay😅😅😅
If I spend hours at something on minecraft, Backing up worlds is a must, Believe me I learnt the hard way lost several worlds.
Lol hes at 1.3 million subs now so that aged quite well
O                               O
750 500 50
W Pizza man
wunba i REFUSE to believe your editor blurred out your feet in the pacing scene
❤
Haha what the hell I guessed how long it would take to place the blocks while under water sprinting
“Oh shoot I wasnt recording”
The dedication is crazy
The music is never gonna give you up
I'll do 12 pushup for every like this comment gets!!!!!

What if you do a build with just items in your chests without have to obtain items from other place or farm...?

Oh Wait Pause back to Mon 3 Jun 2024 He Has 1.3M subscribers!🎉🎉🎉 Edit: Uh Look Closely at the Texts He Wrote He Really Rickrolled Us 10:03 .

10:02 bruh we all got rickrolled
This, is the best ever chain reaction I've seen in Minecraft. It was soooooooo satisfying! Also, Congrats on 1,250,000 subscribers! And, Bro. Just soo much effort you put into this! Sad your old pc was turned into fried chicken. (pun.) lucky! It's like *"TSAR BOMBA"* In a nutshell. Have a good one! You deserved it.
It’s my birthday
THAT WAS SO COOL
Bro like rickroll
Scientifically the bomb is 2 mega tons of tnt
Awesome video, man! :D  Nice of you to mention AutoHotKey! It's an awesome language! I used it in the past to chain skills in a MMO i played (RIFT). I had skills that gave me Attack Points, while other skills used those Attack Points. The more Attack Points i had, the more damage the skill dealt. I used AutoHotkey to cycle through all my skills just by holding "1". It would activate a skill, wait a couple seconds, activate the next one and so on.  Also, in Total War games (used it in Medieval 2 and Rome), I made a "Quick Unit Disband" script using AHK. I selected an army and the script would right-click the first unit's card, click on Disband and confirm, then repeat. I think it would loop while i was pressing a key or so.  So yea, you made an awesome use of AHK, making the script detect the specific pixel color and move the mouse to order pizza!
A irl nuke has 100 mega😅Tons of TNT💀
The deliveryman would be shocking if it wasn't shown at the very start of the video. Glad for the PC though. Very satisfying. Except all end results not being shown.
Cool, you turned your hardcore world into 2b2t spawn area. Good job!
People who used to make superflat worlds with only tnt and bedrock as the blocks: 👇
U r very cool wunba
The one time Microsoft one drive saves your life
bro rlly said "never gonna give you up" lol

I want too be honest, this is the first video I watched on your channel and this is already telling me that anything is possible, I thank you.
Sad the Village got destroyed :(
How did the TNT didn’t lagg him ?
wumba why do u have a wooden axe after making the dirt platform were u using commands

you need to find something better to do with your life ordering a pizza really
Damn dawg the most powerful atomic bomb ever!!
This video should be called: tutorial to destroy your friends house after they prank you by faking your dog death
2:44 if you didn’t catch what it said it says: somebody please some help they are holding me captain and won’t let me stop working until I finish the video!
Is it just me or is he flying at 31:12

I will do -4 push-ups for every dislike this comment gets 🔥
you have a cat???? i saw ur cat's shadow i think
Love the secret rickroll
You are so industry
Q: If Everything turned into birch,what will happen to you?
Dude u deserve 20mil subs at least like ur determination is absolutely incredible. I hate for my idle to be a minecraft YouTuber but I just admire how you can preserve into making these insane videos. People may say your videos are bad or boring and it might be true to them, but know that many people see the effort that goes into your videos and can appreciate and enjoy your videos. I don’t plan to be a content creator but that doesn’t stop me from appreciating your qualities. Thank You for you dedication.
Idk man.. I think if you are going to have this many mods to help you, you may aswell just play in creative mode 🤷 . Btw you have over a million subs.. this video has already made you 20k.. ffs… get a better computer… its your job and at this point its just kinda disrespectful to your audience to not invest in better equipment (especially if you are gonna complain about it)
The thing about Minecraft TNT is that it doesn’t spread very far because you can never get the same effect using a lot of little explosions to equal the power of 1 big explosion… A real life nuke such as the Tsar bomb would have a blast radius of about 250,000 blocks in every direction
you're*
11 thousand levels
bro became oppanhimer
the rick role is crazy
There's only 3 strongholds a world
Bro wanted just to nuke that poor Village💀
10:03 didnt anybody noticed that bro litreally rickrolled evrybody@Wunba nice play
Ngl bro is handsome and majestic
36:17 THOSE BLIKE
Bro does NOT care about the other Important things on the mem card i think that's what it is called
Omg biggest explosion ever my subwoofer going crazy
Bro said “never gonna give you up” while getting resources
100000 more tnt and you're gonna go by by
Try a mod that is called morph mod slay some mobs and go to morphs and you will see the mobs you killed after that click morph BOOM then exit you have become a mob download it please it's cool
10:03 did anyone realise that he just casually Rick rolled us
bro rickrolled us twice in one video
For every lole this comment gets I'll do a push up
Amazing video you earned a sub!
the music lol
44:06 yooooo that was CLEAN
bro rickroll us in a new whole way
on 18:37 you had to press f1 and esc and enter
You should build a t-rex skeleton
13:42 nucular?
Could've just built a transport train through the nether or something
He Rick rolled us 44:20
That chicken in the fuse was the real hero.
the amount of dedication.the time it took. the love for all us fans.You Wunba, has just made a world record, and spent all this time just for a video. I want people to know how much you did! This video was amazing.
bro rickroled us
did nobody notice that the totem blinked at 4:02
Ups it didn't record
WoW it's cool bruh.
Bro is screaming in lowercase 💀 2:42
You literally claimed that you broke the record for most TNT exploded in Minecraft. You're not even close. Even if you meant "in one go," you'd still be wrong, and it's clear you've never watched MC content in the game's early few years... Don't make promises you don't keep and dont make promises you can't keep -_-
nananananananananananana
my fine fella with all due respect. this video was the most boring thing i have ever seen. and this isnt even mathematically accurate or even a quarter of the strength of trinity. and you didnt even say the damn line correctly.
You should put Tony Igy - Astronomia as the background music.
Try to make a neutron bomb in minecraft  cuz it's way more powerful than nuclear
When you built the music stage, I had a feeling its going to be Rick Roll. XD
If you did ot wrong that won’t be the only nuke going off in your area
jaaaaaa cast crafter
what kind of auto clicker is that wtf
I am liking the video for the crazy hard work done here.
Did you survive???
https://youtu.be/Di-UA9lIrc0?si=fMOpShK5I_1QDEH0
blud rickedrolled us
the question is, what type of nuke are we talking for?
Like this if you got the rick,roll
i thought it was a rickroll 44:05
This is probably his best moment of his life.
+1 subscriber for you
BRO RICKROLLED US 💀
😭😟🥺😲
im back bitches
WHen is the world download
I havent watch the video all the way through but i did the math and you would need about 50,000 blocks of TNT (Volume = 8500 cubic metres or around 21 metres)  A block in minecraft is 1 metre so 21 metres x 50,000 = 1,050,000 blocks  Basically you would need 1,050,000 blocks of minecraft tnt to recreate the tsar bomba explosion
thx bro really enjoyed
World Record
the totem of undying blinked
I GUESED IT it was never gonna give you up
Did my guy just rickroll us?
did you survive????
Maybe consider an automated full pc image daily incremental backup strategy.  Because it's surprisingly easy.  And also consider "other backup strategies".  Because doing more than one backup is a good idea.  Oh, and try loading/opening a backup every so awesome.  If there is something making your backup's not work, it's nice to find that out _before_ you need to use a backup, rather than than after.
Bro made it so dramatic 😭
44:20 bro had to rickroll me
@Wunba always have backups. Im starting my own channel and a lot of game data with be stored on the hard drives on my main computer. Mutiple backup systems will help for a speedy recovery in this kind of situation and the potential money loss and downtime.
One point twenty one added the new crafter
man you can be quantum physicist 😂😂😂😂

21:00 what a tool that PC guy was to not only not figure out your problem but to wipe your data without caution AND have the audacity to charge you for it cudos to you for fixing it
20:00 I might be a little late but if you still have either one of those drives there's chances to recover files. hmu
19:00 I was gonna say "wow how did he 1) fix a gpu error by replacing the ssd 2) manage to wipe the ssd when it was not the problem 3) seriously tell you that that woulda fix it"
Rick roll
56:45 now its serious
46:20 wtf

44:15 I KNEW YOU WOULD RICK ROLL US!!
I NEED TO KNOW DID HE SURVIVE i assume he forgot to block the obsidian back up, but… I hope he isn’t dead if he did die, he probably got those shots with replay mod or spectator mode possibly but if he did… well… I hope not…
9:50  *H O P P E R S*
I got rickrolled 44:20
Anyone notice that the totem of undying blinks? 😂
i got rick rolled by wunba 10 minutes in
Listen mister Wunba I have never seen ur channel before in my 10 years ( I'm 15 btw so very long time ) and this is the video I get recommended it's AWSOME, I'm definitely subscribing thanks for this amazing content keep going dude!
23:20 jort storm?
boring
2:43 911 help him
I got a ad 18:32
Bro Rick rolled us at the 🗿🗿🗿
How can you fly because u are sirvidl
I will do one like for every pushup this comment gets🗣️🔥❗️‼️🔥🔥
10:05 "never" 10:07 "gonna" 10:09 "give" 10:11 "you" 10:12 "up" If we combine it will be "never gonna give you up" bro rickrolled us
how can i downlaod ur hardcore world ? mind helping ur subscriber ?.

KINGSAMMELOT DOING A BACKFLIP FOUND IN WUNBA’S VIDEO
Iwill sell something from my home for every like
W editor 😈😎
Just play Hbm nuclear tech mod lol
Watches 10:02 :) sleeping (realizes i got rickrolled)
clearly the bios
The rickrol
280k subs in 2 months?!? How
Get a new pc
how dare you rick roll us
You can break 1 bedrock with 2.5 million tnt
Are we ganna ignore the fact that we just got rickrolled
I’m glad John Mark Comer’s “The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry” got to be a part of the chain reaction. W Jesus Easter egg
These minecraft hardcore vids are evolving in length
Never gonna give you up
we got rick rolled  44:06
the best chain reaction ever 😎
I just now realized I used to watch this guys old dominos videos!
I caught that Rickroll.
13:26 Isn't it 2,263 kitotons
if 1 block to break with a pickaxe that will never break, takes 1 second, 1 trillion blocks mined might take 32k years so that might be why wunba chose tnt i guess or 1 million blocks mined might take a few days
did you atleast survive
Man I knew it was going to Rick roll us by the way love the Rube Goldberg machine
3:49 bro's totem ☠
Don’t scroll down on this comment                   Stop                       STOP           You’re gonna find the treasure        You’re almost there just stop           📙NOOOO you found the death note
r
Who cares what your aplod sequel is your videos are good
You watched Shrek.
his rubiks cube was the only thing i looked at :D LOL also best time = 44:17
I KNEW IT IT WAS RICK ROLL
Never gonna give you up. Did you have to do that?
This is the kind of content that motivates me to launch Minecraft     delete all worlds, uninstall and never play it again.
I hate that you rickrolled so many people and some didn't even notice it
that was for oppenheimer
i'm ganna die!
i,m ganna die
this is blowing my mind
10:00 no way i got rickrolled 💀💀
Your PC almost  fried!😯😣
44:05 this is the best part of the 1 mil sub special
Girls will see this and be like: ew meanwhile boys when they see this: hell yeah!
Your nuke is 2.42 megatons powerful, more powerful than the B83, but nothing compared to these bombs: the Tsar Bomba, which is 50 megatons, Castle Bravo, which is 15 megatons, and Castle Yankee, which is ~12.5 megatons. I might be wrong
Did he actually get monetized
I speak German and was extremly surprised to see castcrafter in this video cause I watch him too.
Wunbas parents:YOU WILL NEVER MAKE MONEY IN LIFE BCUZ OF MINECRAFT wunba:just casually buying a 300 dollar thing for one video
You are the second funniest youtuber that I ever seen
Rick roll?
Did u survive?
1.28m!!!!!!!!!!??!!?!!!!!!!
Wow!!!!!
I love. minecraft but I play bedrock
44:06 nooooo
A bomb exploded not connected to how big it is
This was the most elaborate 1 million subscribers special ever lol 😂
9:55 HOPPERS.
The people who saw the totem blink 👇
Bro really had to Rick roll us at 10:04
Bro this part is so awesome 😱47:04
1:55 someone tell wunba you can craft nether wart blocks
Dude have 1,2m subscribers and last video hit 2,4m and still talking about rent boys we have no hope btw you are genius
imagine u are in the middle of filling this thing with TNT and creaper explodes
KABOOM!!!!!!!!!
0:40 seconds in and there's already pizza involved
Or u could just use /fill…
...
I'm taking notes, I will blow up 1000 tnt blocks in Minecraft hardcore, then watch my house burn down as my pc gets hot enough to form stars, then wait for my pc to collapse into itself creating a blackhole, and when that collapses it will explode with the force of about 1 million megatons, destroying earth, meaning that my Extraterestzone subscription would end, meaning that the ''Thank you for using us'" letter would land on a fragment of earth, where I set up dominoes beforehand which wlll float towards my space button connected to a quantum computer, restarting the simulation! One up that chain reaction if you dare!
i love your channel!!!!!!!!!!!
when you place so much tnt your ssd fries twice
I didn't know "SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE NUKES" were triggered through Rube Goldberg machines..
i hope they refunded that SSD that fried EVERYTHING
44:05 I Knew You Were Gonna Rickroll Us
Nice rickroll
Wunba i hope you see this comment i got that issue you just had with your computer so what you gotta do is press F1 after a menue opens press esc after press the top one that comes to screen you computer restarts and works completly fine
a lot of respect for taking months just to create a video
Wunba gotta be the present Oppenheimer
Woaah that was a really good song
so now i know the use of those goofy ahh conduits 💀💀
14:33
44:07 The fact that you spent over a hundred hours just to rick roll 4 million people is amazing.
bro the rick roll music lol🤣🤣🤣
That rollercoaster is ghost rider from knots barry farm😅
Or... you could just go in creative...
Im a german and know Castcrafter
this video is very good
Do you use complementary shaders for your cinematic shots? If so which version? if not what shaders do you use?
i knew its a rickroll
THE xplojan was big😃😃😃😍😍
I watch in secret
DID HE DIE!?!!?!??!?!??!
32:42 How am i gonna pay my rent H0W AM I G0NNA PAY MY *RENT* 44:26 Nice music! 🎵 (Idk the song but meh 😑😕)
that red marble is everything
Best video ever 🎉
How….how did your computer not crash?
Also at 44:10 he rickrolled us again
Bro just rickrolled us at 10:05 - 10:12 💀
I did 150 trillion by 150 trillion by 150 trillion TNT
According to my calculations 50 Quadrillion(5¹³) of such "1.3m TNT explosions" (or 65 Sextillion TNT) (6.5¹⁹) would be enough to destroy our planet. And to destroy entire Minecraft world it would take 350 Quadrillion (3.5¹⁴) explosions (or 350 Sextillion TNT) (3.5²⁰)
aint nobody gonna congratulate the chicken for sacrificing himself?
DONT FORGET HOPPPPPPPPPPERSSS 😁🙄🙄🙄😤😤😖🤫🤫🤫🤫
If i did this 2 things would blow up the tnt and my laotop
Historically accurate Oppenheimer video
I GOT RICKROLLED
infinity hoppers?
What a dedication
You make a song by breaking block placing blocks in mining the end frames
what mods do you use?
10:03 the ASMR😂😂😂
how many dirt platforms you put in your world?
4:04 is the totem blinking😂😂😂
i like nukes
Bro needs to have a nasa PC to withstand that humongous massive bomb 22:43
Lava the hero of the video fr
Pretty sure this is the second time you have almost lost you world due to a mistake or glitch the first one was getting stuck at the corner of the world and now this is the second time  Edit: 3rd because of that villager in the black hole video
What’s the auto clicker you use?
I never comment on videos but in my 8 years of watching youtube ive never come across someone putting in this much effort in a 1 million special this was very fun🎉
He rickrolled us with music that’s crazy
I don't understand, how could a modern MB even overpower an M.2? It doesn't make sense to me.
Bro rickrolled us in the montage 😂
*boom*
Wait 2016 ?gasp! I was born in 2016!:)
how long did it take you in total?
46 mins
37:31 bro turned into moist critical
1.34:35 just watch from a distance dont waste your and our time( to watch from a distance download nvidium and slyde and crank up your render distance) 2.44:16 good song
You Rigroll Me!
12:55 why is there a wooden axe in the 8th hotbar
love the new editor
At least if you do something like this again, your PC should be able to handle it since it replaced a PC that couldn't process as many gigabytes into its hard drive. Now you can!
Do you back up your entie pc onto a separate physical hardrive now?
2 rickrolls in 1 vid :c
25:35
You just Rick Rolled us 😢 10:06
The chain reaction is the trigger for the Nuke!
Oppenheimer would be proud
...
Everybody go to 2:42 and pause
W editor
Капеец... Красава 👍  Респект  нереальные старания 👍👍👍👍👍👍🎉🎉
Wait…What happened to the pizza?
Bro was like Oppenheimer I have become death destroyer of worlds

alright that's it. I'm subscribing. You left me with no other choice
17:17 That was under a second!😮🤯
Bro just coulda put shulkers with with sand in shulkers in shulkers to s store the sand
Make Minecraft in Minecraft hardcore with redstone  Who agree 👇
44:00
bro you cooked 🔥🔥🔥🔥
35:20 bro is getting paranoid as fuck XD
14:34 if a creeper spawned and if he didn’t notice it would be all over lol
Bruh
😂
Doing the calculations for the kilotons of TNT used, one TNT block is One meter cubed of TNT, which is essentially 1,650 kilograms of TNT, since there's 1.3 million blocks, we just do 1,650 x 1,300,000 which comes to 2145000000 kilograms of TNT, since nuclear weapons are typically measured in kilotons of TNT, this becomes 2145 kilotons, which becomes 2.145 megatons, just shy of the 57 megatons used in the Tsar Bomba (world's most powerful nuclear weapon), anywho, if we were to make a Minecraft bomb larger than the Tsar Bomba, Wunba would need 57 million subscribers, SO LETS MAKE IT HAPPEN PEOPLE!
wunba clearly in the mr beast school this video is amazing
Did you survive or not??????????????
nice rick roll
Wow he rickrolled us ima unsub >:(     I’m joking I’m not gonna unsub       Btw I liked the Rick roll wong
first time i didnt say i hate someone when i get rickrolled
Okay, let me break down 18:43 for ya.  "The VGA card is not supported by UEFI driver": Your computer is confused on what the GPU (VGA card) is. Fix: Remove the GPU and try integrated graphics. "CSM (Compatibility Support Module) settings have been changed for better compatibility": Setting your computer to boot the old fashioned way and using fallback VGA drivers. (y'know, 'cause the GPU is broken). When you remove your GPU, remember to reset BIOS settings. "Your system has POSTed in safe mode": First failed boot: because you held the power button to shut it down. Subsequent boots: because your last boot did not boot the system  PS. A POST is a Power On Self Test-- it checks how the system is working.  ---- Here's what happens on boot (maybe) ----- Motherboard: "Good morning M.2_1. What are you?" M.2_1: "I'm a Corsair MP600 Pro NH." Motherboard: "Thank you. SATA_0???? HELLO?" SATA_0: *does not exist* Motherboard: "Okay." Motherboard: "RAM module 0?" RAM module 0: "Here and I'm [n] gigabytes." Motherboard: "RAM module 1?" RAM module 1: "Here and I'm [n] gigabytes." Motherboard: "GPU?" GPU: "I'm a yyyyyyyyyyyy and my driver is 0xffffffffff in your dictionary of UEFI drivers." Motherboard: "That's not right. STOP THE POST!" *displays error*  EDIT1: Hey wait. I think your GPU was dead too. EDIT1: Also, wow. Thanks, but your "problem" you talked about is wrong. The motherboard would fry NOTHING or EVERYTHING on a single voltage rail. And it would actually be your PSU that's the culprit in that case.
Did you do face revel yet
dude you rickrolled me
HOPPERS 9:51
I think this is the most entertaining Minecraft video I have ever watched
WHY?! WHY RICKROLL!? 44:20
bro why the rick roll
if I had half his passion I would rule USA
wouldn't the world record be a superflat world made of TNT and bedrock below?
OMG, I actually thought you had lost your world!!!
...
wow...
I'm going into this knowing how unsatifiying big TNT explosions tend to be any time you got TNT high enough that it literally can't even land on unexploded terrain before it goes off, and I'm just just increasingly aware that the sheer volume of work needed to actually make a TNT stack this big built in survival mode is gonna be infinitely more impressive than the actual explosion.
guys look at his th slotbar at 12:56 thats a wodden axe wich mean he used world edit
Touch Some grass
Poor chicken
A frickin rick roll really? 😂😝
8:27 💀
2:14 bro wasted time, to save time.

Also, creepers can’t blow the thing up.
This is the coolest minecraft video that i ever watched

Imagine he accidentally blows it up mid wau

How would you feel if I one up this video?
I made a 20 by 20 by 20 tnt block and blew it up it was huge
The totem blinked!
“I did some farming and mining off camera.”
18:39 PC freeze 1 19:32 PC freeze 2
"hoppers hoppers hoppers" such truly inpiring words🤗🤗 bro also this could have gone so wrong since obsidian cannot handle that much tnt

Cool Now make a MIRV
Bro, how many days did you even did this?😂😂😂
Ngl since you built the farlands you should build the brick pyramids  (//>//<///)
Me: “What happens when you name a dolphin Skavio?” Wunba: “then the dolphin will minus 200 IQ!”
Important lesson to back up your data
Wunba has 1Vi subs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11😁😁
I so respect that you are risking you're hardcore world to make us good content!!!
Worlds Coolest rube goldburg machine
the tnt was amazing but the best part was how this is a yt video involving some kind of employee that is not the youtuber being a nuisance to someone.
That was butifal 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Did anyone notice that he rickrolled us when collecting the items for the ULTIMATE STORAGE MACHINE
2 months ago!!!
Breakfast?? I was having breakfast while I was watching!!!
i got inspired and exploded 10000 TNT on my crappy PC , It crashed
he made a illusion
This project was so crazy that he didn't even corrupt the world, he corrupted an entire hard drive until it refused to function anymore. TWICE
You da best
I will do 0 pushups for every like this gets
I'm so sorry you used up 311.25 dollars on this!!! 😭😭😭 But at least you made a good video 😅
the music was smoooth

Pro Engineers tipp: "If you fry your ssd once, backup your data for once."
"Placing TNT until i PASS OUT"😂😂
He rick rood
The poor chicken man
30:00
He rick rolled us
I knew the song before it even played
12:41
The record for most tnt acquired in a Minecraft world is 3,948,931,410,300,202,000 which is Three quintillion, nine hundred forty-eight quadrillion, nine hundred thirty-one trillion, four hundred ten billion, three hundred million, two hundred thousand.
18:52 That means your VGA card is not supported by UEFI driver. you needed to press F2 on this screen and your computer may will boot up succesfully
Your the guy that built a black hole LOL 😅
i expanded the storage just a little bit he says
Do u live in Corpus Christi?
44:13 bruh why
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
I am SO pissed that he rickrolled us
I love Rick astly
I love that song
What😂
I Built A Mathematically Accurate NUKE in Minecraft!  Wunba 1.27M subscribers  Subscribe
Wunba made a reference to his last video where skavio took forever to get a magma cube 31:49
Build tsar bomba
For the song, I'm guessing either Final Countdown or Katy Perry's Firework. If you are wondering, I'm commenting as I watch
1. Your PC is a prebuild - contact a custom PC maker (I build and don't charge very much at all for my labor, usually around $500 plus the parts desired).  2. Don't Overclock your builds if you aren't certain you know exactly what you are doing - it's more of an art than a science, just FYI... and usually unecessary these days with todays CPU/RAM/GPU options.  3. That was your UEFI (new BIOS) screen, probably due to a corrupted boot medium. You corrupted your OS by writing to it too much - you probably were running MC and your OS on an SSD, which has a finite amount of write endurance before it becomes unusable. Consider using a RAM-FS for Minecraft that has that many block updates (or a dedicated server that you don't need to maintain), and keep backups of your OS disk periodically.
The pizza slice at the time 27:46 is a drop from Medusa in Terraria.
13:45 caught me off gaurd
build minecraft in minecraft it's run with no command block just redstone
so mathmatical i cant keep up
I love how he takes the time to blur has feet at 32:39😂

The Nerd: WuNbA sOmEoNe DiD 1.5 mIlLiOn TnT
wait auto crafting exist?
I will do "nothing" for every like this comment gets.
Congrats. You became the destroyer of world. You can now join Nier in Replicant
@20:00 hahaha No Backup - no Pity! Well deserved! Esp. the fact that YOU DID NOT LEARN from the first failed Drive is so dumb!
@9:45 yeah right.. there are only 3 end portals on any given world, you can't build 5
😮
Stop Magmacube Abuse!!!
Wow, that was very dramatic and cool You got a sub on my 15 alt accounts (joke I don't have that many alts) Awesome video! I binged this whole thing. Awesome.  Mad respect to you.
i just got pizza today
Respect for the chicken, he sacrificed his own life to trigger that nuke. He will never be forgotten. 1 like = 1 respect
Slickest rickroll in history 44:24
The fact that he Rick rolled us in his own video 😂
Frying 2 drives in 1 week? I would've caressed that PC with a hammer at that point. These SSDs can be expensive as frick. (Especially Samsung Evo drives)
who saw the pillages at the villager part?
he just made 2 nukes, one in minecraft and another out of his pc😂
Never gonna give you up
you didnt make a backup after almost losing everything the first time...
worst ending i've ever seen
The problem you got from the post screen was not the storage, it was the vga driver or your video card in general. Press f1 to post it with current settings and save yourself a nice 300$
We all got rick rolt
HOPPERS!!!!
I will do 0 pushups for each like this comment gets 🖕🙌🏻🙌🏻👣 👁👄👁
0:00 boring intro
how to get carpel tunnel (speedrun)
i got rickrolled :(
I like pizza
The way he brutally rickrolled us with no remorse 💀
Wumba I have a question for you
Rumpelstiltskin Geroge Sebastian Jeffery Fredrick Huckleberry Esquire the 27th is the goat
Who else knew instinctively that he would Rickroll us?
Firzt of all why didnt you backup stuff or use a different card for this?
I bet the PC is gana be a bigger explshen then the boom
Nah bro confused my pizza guy he just wanted to give someone pizza 💀
I got rick rolled
Can you build the World Trade Centers
for will pushups do like do 100 every I
FREE MONEY HERE 👉 44:08
Big respect for spending lots of money and hard for entertainment big respect that earns a subscriber
I loved this thanks for entertaining me I've liked and subscribed to your channel
44:15 I knew it is rickroll...
You know what you just earned yourself a new subscriber
I didn't no totems can blink😮😮😮😮
Legends say the delivery driver is still waiting for him
i new it was a rick roll
Tsar Bomba
Damn you got me doing 😀 👍
2months ago, wow
hoppers
the double rickroll is crazy
45:12 don't thank me
13:36 well yes, but the biggest bomb ever made was the tsar bomb which had 50,000kt TNT    Edit: or I may just be stupid, maybe it only had 50kt kinda unsure
So the Question arrives how much Damage onto an Individual (in Hearts) does TNT? And how much Hearts a Bomber-Plane?    @Wunba
The rickrolling while getting the items
Bro just give in install a power generator mod and AE2 or refined storage and boom. Crafting and storage a problems of the past. Modding is life. Thing is i have an aversion to vanilla mc bc i played to much of it
i will do a like every comment this push up gets
41:06 WHATS THIS
It had been 35 years, Portugal had a golden generation, wouldn’t have mattered anyway.
Bros patience is higher than how much times i failed my math test
I just rickrolled by a minecraft player.
Bro turned into oppenheimer 💀 45:20
I called that Rickroll😂
This is why I trust my most important files on a good old spinny hard drive. They will at least usually give some warning before failing. I have never had one fail but I have had SSD's fail.
OMG that was a big big explosion
Wunba is a legend
26:52 Rubik's cube.
This is the best rickroll 😂
Never gonna give you up
2:44 💀
Wunbenheimer
bro, i was expecting a nuke, not to cry because of how inspirational this is
30 seconds in: Excuse me?
6:29  that person will prob leak the link
That was anti climatic, all that for like 2 seconds of watching tnt ?
Bro I'm just going to cry
And 2 blocks update
You dumb is 156 mob you 3 new mob come soon
I gotta say, hopefully the whole mobo frying your ssd incident makes you back up important data more often.
dont know if this was the drive you were using but there was a batch of samsung 980 pro SSD's with a bugged firmware that would cause the drive to die very quickly, could be that you got one of those
Nice Video... I think the last time I lost a lot of data, recordings and game save data was when I was about 17, which was over 27 years ago. Since then I have always backed up my data. I have now reached over 100 TB of storage total ;) But you usually have to lose data before you can really take it seriously. PS: If you like chain reactions and art that disappears into thin air after a short time. Then maybe large fireworks would also be a hobby for you.
I was expecting a better explosion
I forgot the time but he said never gonna give you up when he was collecting items
I made every size of tnt schematics
I honestly feel so bad he almost got his channel deleted, life ruined, and all his years of work down the drain just to try to entertain us
i like the musik htp// ■♡
Perhaps the most anticlimactic thing I've ever witnessed.
Boycott Dominos free palestine
a tsar bomb is equal to 34545454.55 mc tnt blocks
Bro made a movie better than Disney or marvel ever could
hello wunba, i one day, i have created a giant tnt made by 150x150x150 tnt's
We got rickrolled😂
I literally predicted the rick roll

Tnt so big, he destroyed his pc before even detonating it.
Next video: Today I am going to be building a 1 to 1 replica of Hiroshima!
Oppenheimer in minecraft
Best Minecraft vid of 2024 so much effort
I love your determination
such a cool idea
Bro blew my record up 💀 I made a vid with 100k tnt lol. Although I was on a anarchy multiplayer
yeah but speaking of dominos like the chain reaction is like one of the parts of the chain reaction and another that activates the next like one domino falling on one

Bro Rick rolled us

Hello, I have a very interesting idea! In my world, I build space, that is, planets, galaxies, nebulae, and so on. Approximately one nebula takes 10-15 hours. I propose to build a cosmos in the world of the end

I was looking for this vid, earned a sub! :D
runway 6
Pls blur your face next time
14:38 "butt"
I misheard "hoppers" as "poppers" and i'm laughing my butt off.
Hey wumba it will really help my other channel out if you could tell me what screen recorder you use?
6:17 is that a kingsammelot at the right down corner?
That's crazy?? but cool !!!
Wow i had no clue your channel used to be a domino chain reaction channel, theres a good chance that i watched some of your videos without knowing it. Amazing 😅
Well that was a huge waste of time.
barely understood it, it was awesome

Imagine forgetting to film after all of this tho—
24:13 HOW DID THE TOTEM OF UNDYING BLINK? (I never knew it was a feature)
Amazing I just watched Oppenheimer and I see the resemblance
you did not eat breakfast before do this
did i just get rickrolled?
Ehm... Sorry, dude, but where is the explosion? You spent so much time to make this bomb and compile it into a video to just say in the end: "Ok, there was a huge explosiion". Why?
Nice
46 minutes of yapping to not show the aftermath of the explosion properly
Why did he just spawn TNTs?
Did you succeed and survive?
bro made the worlds largest lag mechine
NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP!!!
The dedication is insane keep it up
why didn’t you back it up 🙈
YOU RICKROLLED ME!!!
18:58 rip his pc
Ok that scaffolding accident with the auto-clicker had me DYING 🤣🤣🤣
I was watching a different video and realized u had a dukey creeper farm and I would recommend building methodzz creeper farm as it is the best I think creeper while not being an EOL farm. I built it and u don’t have slice portals or update suppression. Just a perimeter. Shulker craft also built it and u could easily build it.
Nice man, that was POWERFUL
Just click the f11 bruh
a very huge tnt blobk in minecraft is full of thousand of tnt that can destroy everything in its path that similar to Hiroshima
So did you survive
My anxiety when watching this🚯🚯🚯☢☢☢☣☣☣📴💀
It's WEERY COOL BRO )
wunba you should check how many blocks u have placed onto your world If possible
cringe lmao who plays minekampf
@castcrafter er hat dich überboten
Go out and touch grass dude
Crazy dominoes, rube goldberg nuke...  Wunba is the ultimate edgelord
Guys put a shulker box in a shulker box in a shulker box its good for storage

Step 1 is getting a NASA computer
your videos are bad
Bro at 45:51 he said this… and by the way did he get his pizza?
Truly a Rube Goldberg machine beyond compare
Hi Wunba! Love the videos! I was wondering what mods and resource packs you use. Keep up the good work and I am so thrilled to see the next videos
ITS CALLED PLAIGIARIZED NOT COPYRIGHTED
Bro really did one of those cartoon style contraptions that usually start some kind of intricated trap Scooby Doo/Looney toons style in actual real life to order pizza thanks to Minecraft and start another contraption in Minecraft to make 1.3 million blocks of TNT explode for the 1 Million subs special... Congrats you earned my subscription too it was amazing.
rick roll coming
did you died ?
Bro rickrolled us twice
Bru
think it would be more like a nuke if it was as tall as 1 tnt blast kan reach, since then not half the tnt just goes kaboom in the air for no destruction
44:07 getting rick rolled
9:54 hopper, chest hopper, hopper and hopper😂
The video starts at 45:20 you're welcome
Awesome
that pc blowin up is gonna be 130000x more powerful than TSAR BOMBA

bro has a heartwarming backstory for everything
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO RICK ROLL ME
how many hours did it take?
11:24 how do you droping everything from chest / eq ?
no way you just built a 1.9 gigaton nuke
45:51 was the coolest moment when he said,"I am become death. The destroyer of worlds."was top notch.
24:53 Poor Village.
I have a solution for fried SSD. Don't use SSD use HDD. The flash chips are shit because they produce a lot of heat in a small space but HDD produces less heat and is larger.
we got rickrolled
9:58
Nice rick roll
This reminds me of a video I seen before 🤔
the best example of quality over quantity
I’m saying this as I watch 33:27 The SECOND he said he has a surprise song I immediately knew I was gettin rickrolled😂   Edit:I FREAKING TOLD U😂😂😂
we got rick-rolled
Got Rick Rolled
The only nuclear bomb he made was his PC💀💀💀
Just download the ME system mod and it will be shit ton more better
wunba you are the most dedicated minecraft youtuber i have ever seen and your editing skill is on another level. i wanted to ask you whether you use sodium or not?
Did you survive
When the tnt exploded at least that pig in the background survived
44:09 I am not surprised
saw this and the only thing that went through my mind was that one meme of 2 guys playing minecraft and guy 2 goes "oh btw i placed tnt", guy 1 "how many?", guy 2 "just 10 thousand" and blows it up, guy 1 going "10 thousand!? MY PC!" while it lags out and the pc fans are heard in the background🤣🤣
Did you atheist get the dominoes
it would’ve been better if you had walked out of your safe hole and show the distraction in person
Nice ^-6
dude dropped 2k xp in a second
WHY YOU RICK ROLL US? WHY WHY WHY
I will sleep 5  minutes less every like on this comment
Bro who saw the totem of undying blink
The Rick role is to funny to be mad at
44:04 when you did the previous note blocks , I was like "bro missed a good chance to rickroll" and there we go , it happened on the second part 😂
One of the greatest testaments to dedication and will I've ever seen. Awesome show, great job! Definitely subbed and I would love to see a tour of the aftermath if you're able to. Cheers!
orange words at 9:58 are rickrolling us
The problem is your computer is going to crash😂😂😂

respect for the use of "the ruthless elimination of hurry" by John Mark Comer in the marble track
This should not be free. Mr Beast level content but for 50 minutes
Bro this is an amazing vid it inspired me❤❤🎉
All that for 20 seconds and he didnt show the full crater or whether he survived
Wow, 2 fried SSDs? Damn. Now you guys know the importance of having both a big boi several terabyte HDD for backups AND Cloud backups on top of that.
Bro is jobless
Oh cmon men, you rickroll me LOL
Funny, found that your name was in dictionary in part of mad scientist. Subbed! Big thumbs up from Finland!🤘🤘
Really wish the ending was more... Amazing work though :) Would have loved to see more of the damage done.
I would love to see more images of the devastation.
Imagine a creeper spawned and exploded when we was nearly done placing all the tnt
damn
poor chicken dead #RIPCHICKEN
The best video that i've seen in 2024
Does your computer ever turn off?
I didn’t expect to get rickrolled from some random ASMR segment in a random Minecraft vid
Rube Goldberg be proud.
I had a feeling he was going to rickroll us but hey he had the opportunity and he did it
The song: it’s a song  Me(a musician):it’s a chromatic scale
I want a poster
HOW DID YOU DO THAT!
Mr.computer guy was going to be the best dude he has to be
Hiii Im new I will sub

Thus I vein we got ricked by never gonna live an tnt 100x but somehow not give up on living. This guy says you get ricked.
Holy shit this was bonkers!! And a Rick roll too?  Yea that's going to be a subscribe.
10:06 this mf ricked us

Ayo the Rick roll
26:37 YAY!!! DOORS!!! SO EXCITING!!! 🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉
you the glitch at 18:32 perfectly transitioned into an add
Ngl, that was a great time to rickroll. Lol
Oh god…  The fact this is a Hardcore world SERIOUSLY shows dedication. If I remember correctly, it’s completely impossible to enable cheats in hardcore! Props, man.
i subscribed! 😃
Awesome vid but how is this mathematically or scientifically accurate if it isn't the same strength as a nuke
if you want a real comparision to a real nuke it would twice as powerful than the nuke, b83 that has 1.2 megatons (1200 kilotons) to 2.4 megatons, the b83 is the most powerful nuke in service today. if you really wanna go deeper, the tsar bomba, is the largest nuke ever detonated, made by the russians. with 50 megatons or 50000 kilotons. AND if you want to go for more info both of the real bombs are thermonuclear bombs, which uses a nuke, to explode a even bigger nuke. they are the biggest variant of bombs, hopefully.. that stays the same or decreases.
did you live did you die
Doing US History notes on the atomic bomb and cold war while watching this video goes so hard
am i trippin since when did the totems blink
Did the totem of undying just blink?!
SMART RICKROLL
Lmao bro did not just quote Oppenheimer 💀
But did you die
since you forget how to make certain potions maybe its time for an automatic brewing stand being able to create every potion you desire
can anyone tell me all the mods he used?
If this is the record I will breack this record for 2M tnt exploded in Minecraft in some years when I am an adult 👋 ❤

"At 10:34 this morning, the bomb went off."  Dude ordered a 10am pizza.... lol
The 300000 TNT guy is german

The reason your motherboard fried your ssds is probably because you were writing GBs of data every minute and reading A TON of data as well.
Did Minecraft fried his storage? 👀👀👀👀
This is a masterpiece, outstanding job, the editing is also exceptional
BRO RICK ROLLED US
I wish that you cod have 20 M subs

Hey you should make a giant arena where you can fight mobs over and over again using mob spawners
So where’s the video exploring the devastation?
Did he survive or is the world over?
We all just got Rick rolled😭😭😭

But tell me. How on EARTH did I know we were going to get Rick rolled. I mean I get it was a little obvious but still, that caught me off guard 😂😂😂

TheRe is a mod called stacker, it allows you to customize how many blocks are in a stack, and let you stack shulkers with the same items in it.
*This was sickness project ever. imagen: small channels makes 1 video in 1 hour - 1 day. large channels make 1 video in month. and it was worth it.*

i like the video one suggestion is that you place tnt minecarts stacked in one block which would be alittle more impressive ,this is a suggestion.
"...can you hear the music?"
how are you grabbing an entire shucker of blocks with one click
Caboom
44:20 WHY
I absolutely love the Minecraft hardcore channels that just do the most insane over the top projects
❤❤
YOU DID NOT RICKROLL US WHILE EXPLAINING WHAT YOU NEEDED FROM THE SAND STORAGE
Not to be rude but you were incredibly lucky to have that first SSD recovered, but to not do a data backup after such a close call is wild. Always backup your data.
You rickrolled me during the video.
soooo did he survive?
Who else saw that.  never gonna give you up
I love how he matches the placing blocks montage to the song 🤣🤣
we don't get to see the explosion? BRUH thats dum
bruh stop making the video so "meaningful" and "reflections" I just wanna watch the video
I did some research and if this big block of TNT were to explode in rl the fireball would almost be twice the size of a Minutemen-1
Congratulation on you bro😊 But you'll get sick because when a gnt explods,player will get sick
what autoclicker u use?
I liked and subbed cause you put sooooooo much work into these
The amount of times he said hoppers
This reminds me of my old bedrock world from years ago on a flat world where I made a huge base out of strictly tnt. My brother blew it up. I smacked him.
The ordering dominos reminded me of the time a friend ordered pizza to our houses from the tv browser thing in gmod lmao
10:23 no way i got Rick rolled in a wunba video 🤦🏻‍♀️
Bro rickrolled us💀💀💀
Warning: Bright Flashing Lights, Rickroll
eeerrrrmmmm nukes arnt in minecraft buddy🤓
HOPPERS LOL ×6 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
bro made the most majestic insporing video ever all while making the modt epic video wver😭😭😭
My ADHD brain wants to skip to the boom, but im so intrigued by the idea of increasingly complicated mechanics
he did this all just to rickroll us guys
But did you survive
*WHY DID I EXPECT THE RICKROLL THO*
So every person is 2 m tall?
Bro didn't realise that he could've just duplicated one tnt -
Thats the craziest one million special i have ever seen, complete respect 👍🫡🫡🫡🫡
never gonna give up i never thought i would be rick rolled in a minecraft video but here we are good work Wunba
Your a very smart person being to do all that i would only be able to make some of the puzzle
I replied to my comment
the amount of effort this man does in real life or video games shall be approved!
Neva gonna give you up #Rickroll
did i hear never gonna give you up at 10:07?
10:01 no one notice that he rickroll us between the colecting phase. (italian btw)
Never thought id get rickrolled in minecraft 44:20
44:12 Minecraft rickkroll lol
Bruh Wunba rickrolled me
Hey Wunba, how long would it take to get all beacon effects only using the emeralds the foxes collect ⁉️
bro i just said "i have become death,the destroyer of worlds" before the video even said it,i jinxed lol
Which nuke? Nukes have been different size And, do you mean the test nuke, or the ine dropped over Japan?
Neil! Great Video💪
> doesn't backup critical files (???) > loses critical files Ah that sucks and could have easily been avoided, but at least I can sympathize with assuming your computer can never break. Most people need to lose files once to take backing up seriously, despite it's simplicity and minimal time/money investment. > does not set up backup (or do any of the many obvious things that would have prevented data loss.) Well unfortunately at this point you have lost all empathy I had. > probably still no backup   I have so many questions.
LESSON IN MAKING SURE TO BACKUP TO CLOUD STORAGE GUYS
we just got rick rolled..
The odasidy to rick roll us!
Blud thinks hes blockenheimer
thank you Wunba you have inspired me to build crazy farms
U forgot blast protection armor…
Wait did u survive the "reckoning" and yes i am calling it the reckoning
UFFF   Bro said the 1 Sub = 1 TNT when he was like 12-13 ?  Now bro has 1.24M SUBS like WHANT THE HELL ???!!!!
Or we did not just get rick roled😂
25:17 So emotive… THANKS
I know you started from minecraft and one day I would like to make videos like you on my channel. You are my inspiration
i knew it it was the rick roll song
We need him to go into the creator and look around
dispensers be like: BLEAEGEGHAEEHGH🙂
12:17 RUBIK'S CUBE SPOTTED what's ur main cube and what's ur avg?!
u could fix it by just going to bios then save and save the bios (dont change things)
10:04 that was the smoothest Rick roll ever
he censore his feet 💀
Thanks
Wait but why did the totem of undying blink LOL
You shoulde get 100m subs
19:07 that is why you shouldnot play your computer too much because ssd wil gets fried
u need help <3
cool video dude
dang I was thinking you where going to be in creative mode but your in hardcore?! that would be so hard
I don't think I have been more impressed.  The level of dedication is 2nd to none.  What are you doing? Your talents should be at NASA or beyond.  For real.
I think we got ricked rolled by music from minecraft 😂😂😂😂
wow
cheater! nerd!
so good video, you very nice. good luck
that was so stupid and such a waste of my time and yours
ok, please stop wasting your life and just do this in creative mode...
you could have gotten the sand stored way easier if you just had used  H O P P E R S .
Bro rickrolled us :-D
I took a shot every time he said satisfying and got hospitalized with alcohol poisoning
truly committed and that pizza guy is the real g
for
45:20 here is the explosion ... 45 min of intro for a 20 second explosion ...
Rube Goldberg would be proud
Wish we could have seen more of the whole that nuke left in the world, awesome video
never gonna give you up
YOU COULD HAVE USED A TURTLE HELMET
Sympathize with the pc problems but this is genuinely now a business so invest in some proper backup solutions. Well worth it.
44:15  I knew it was going to be a rickroll
44:10 BRUH WHY RICKROLL
nice rickroll
RAID1 and nas backup is your friend.
Insanely sick
Bro is playing like if he was in creative
Legend has it. The pizza man is still standing there.
im sorry if i sound like a nerd but obsidian isnt UNBREKABLE by tnt it just has a hight blast resistance (3m to be exact) so if the tnt block was 1.3m tnt it technicaly couldnt even break 1 obsidian block but i digress bc better be safe than sorry also CONGRATS ON 1M WUNBA 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂🎂
Rick Rolled ! 😭 Wp mate 😂
🤓
Very very disappointing end to the video. I expected so much but you showed so less of the destruction at the end and I feel I wasted so much time watching the entire video 😢
Tactical nuke ready for launch 🤣

Booooo booooo👎👎👎👎hate the RICKROLL! But bro's PC really tried to use Unreal Engine 38419
I like how this guy does the most out of pocket or over the top shit in minecraft but I'm all for it
bro rickrolled us and thought we didnt notice
wow, congratZ!!! made my morning.. love the video !!!!
10:05 bro rickrolled us without us knowing
Wunba can  u collect all 2,700 tropical fish combination?
I used to watch his old channel😢 and I'm glad he got a new one
This must be so tiring I would never want to do this
The design will already take a whole year for me 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
10:06 Rick roll
Epic dedication!  More than earned my sub!  Keep doing awesome things!!!

28:37
Not to be that guy. But did he Rick roll us???? 😂😂😂
Jeez some of these people have no lives
13:58 he would just lose his mouse warranty😂
10:03 aint no way blud just rickrolled me like that
Am i the only one who wanted to know the following thigns?
2:44 see it now We got Rick roll 10:04 to 10:12
9:54 HOPPERS OPPERS HOPPERS HOPPERS, JR. DOUBLE TRIPLE HOPPERS

I don't used to watch any foreign youtuber so their are no foreign youtuber in my subscription list. But after watching your 1 video (this one) ,you are in my subscription list 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤
that muzic tho
yeah never gonna happen :D  i mean there are bigger ones .. man you can set the world generation to tnt instead of  dirt XD
Cast crafter is 1 of my favorite german youtuber 😂😂
there aint no way he gonna do that right after building the farlands
did you rly have to put rick roll?
10:03 rickroll
wunba has too much free time
sup
could u pls name all of the usefull modes that u have?
where i gat the world ?
bro has nasa pc
Do u ever complete your own parkour ? Comment and pin it if youre reading this plsss
Ahh the joys of unemployment..
Did u have to add the rick roll at 10:00
man was hunger a detecated at the same time
Kilotons is... Actually really weak for nukes.. Now a days anyway. We are now in MEGA tons. Kilo tons are ww2 levels.
had no idea how much work goes into some of these videos. cool stuff mate.
I knew the rick roll was coming 😂
what a waste of time, not only to watch but for you to set all this up. how disappointing.
All that TNT can't explode all at once to create a explosion like that, you would have to make a fireball with the strengh of all those tnt, and then see what happens, use commands
Very Impressive
Bro became oppenheimer
This is pretty much evidence that there's 𝘯𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 an excuse 𝘯𝘰𝘵 to build it in hardcore! Whatever it is, i'm pretty sure you can do it c:
Please go outside your not ok
45:31 pig is like in hiroshima
the rick roll at 10:00
Did anybody else see the rick roll? 10:03—10:16
Jason is my name
my birthday is in january 13
When you said of the lost of your hardcore make me remembe this but in Roblox... I downland for first time roblox in 2018, but i was in Xbox One and yeah, the gamepass... I dont wanted paid the gamepass and I never more gonna play that account, but my secundary account have almost everything in roblox.
I will do a push-up for every comment this like gets
bro asmr rickrolled us
Dis mans here making a nuke, yet the most complex thing I ever made was a boatable sky bridge that connected all mine and pals' bases, with a soul sand bubble stream water elevator to go up, and safety-rimmed ponds to jump down into

Gonna get some emeralds 7:30  him taking 13 staks of emerald bloks
In older versions of minecraft, you couldn't destroy TNT without detonating it, imagine doing this challenge with that restriction.
...serious rickroll?
This is crazy how you took so much time and effort into this. I really congradulate you on this. I really do
AMAZING!!!😲😲😲
the music was rick role?
holy shit, imagine if you put all that effort into real life engineering, we'd be living in the future now.
took a 5 minute video idea and stretched it to 46 minutes
bro he rick rolled as 10:03 .pay attention to the Orange words.
I know that song
good job wumba i am very happy for your sucess of tnt  was almost going to cry i have no words
you rick rolled as bro
awesome video bro
Go for 9000 000 i believe you
What are the -x-x- dimensions for this? Asking for a friend.
32:28 it’s funny he censored is feet
Кто тоже видел перевод?
verry extreme video. and very well production.
i will do one push up for every like this video gets
I just wanna watch explsion, NOT almost hour of gameplay shit...
Bro watch too much oppenhimer
i did this too ... and my minecraft server crashed hard!
I would regret spending so much time grinding in game like this.
"he just died..." Wunba is so funny lol😂
do you remember gamer
They say there's two types of people. Those who do regular backups and those who've never lost everything in a hard drive crash. I learned that the hard way unfortunately.
Who got 750?
And people tryd to say dream was the best Minecraft player ?! Get the fuck outa here. This man…this beautiful man is THE MINECRAFT. When mojang made this game he made a sub secret creation and it was this man. His existence was once an idea from our blocky ancestors created by our great pixelated god. His legacy will be too great to pass down but his story will be remembered and echo on throughout history.
Why is your game so saturated it hurts my eyes
Boom🌋🌋🌋🌋💣💣💣💣💣💣☢☢☢☢☢
why 27
He broke the boundaries between minecraft and reality
For reference of the power of this explosion, it would be approximately 161.4 times as powerful as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, that helped end world war 2
of course he had to do a rick roll
I never expected to be Rickrolled by a minecraft nuke video
Bro is sorry for his upload schedule beacuse his pc broke 🫡
You definitely should have claimed a refund on that 300$ "repair" job. The man did a shitty job and you paid ridiculous money for it. He should have 100% found that your motherboard was faulty during diagnostics.
Bro actually making mrbeasf level content alone?😮 crazy
Those who are now ricrolled 👇
aint no way i got rick roll
1 wil do 1 pushup for anny like on this comment
he turned 1 project into 100 projects
CONGRATS! Im so happy you had a backup of the world!
i couldn't even do this in creative man how do you have so much time
10:03 never gonna give you up
at 45:24 is the explosion
I love your videos thank you
Bsnanabsna
Can't you build it with creative mode and test on normal mode?
I almost cried
You bring false advertisement to a new level with that title.
Your hardcore world is a sham, the current fastest xp grinder would get you to lvl 1000 in 33 hours afking, requiring 4,500,000raw xp. to have 13,000 levels would require 758,389,720 raw xp which is 168.531048889 times the amount. Using this you can simply multiply the 33 hours by the difference to get a rough estimate of how many hours of literally AFK'ing the fastest way of getting xp for a grand total of 5561 Hours or 231DAYS of afking.
10:05 , 44:07 you really rickrolled us
Remember me still
Did you survive???? How big was the crater??? AAAAAAAA
All that buildup, and no payoff
rip chiken
great job i loved the vid
did anybody notice that the music was a rickroll, it was literally "never gonna give you up"
I believe in you!!😢😊🎉
Did he ever say if he survived or not?
Rick roll
"hardcore" lost its meaning the second you said "mod".
u should of just copy it and put it in a survival world
This video... was it only an excuse to rickroll us? 😂
I’ve done more tnt jus sayin (also I’m not kidding I’ve actually done more)
to solve the problem of moving the gunpowder just fill shulkers with shulkers with shulkers uf gunpowder
just imagine what he will do for 5 mil subs
did you die
I love how nice that culinary man was
that one kid just making a tnt world
keep up the good work king👑
Bro have done this whole thing to rickroll us :)
I KNEW IT WOULD BE A RICKROLL BRO!!!!!!!
What a loser. Storing all files on one drive, without having several backup options on others drives and file backups on the cloud, is stupid.
I just subscribed only because you’re crazy.. In a good way :)
Someone obviously has no personal life
POST PLEASE
It is your best video! Please continue!!!
Чувак, это просто супер! Поздравляю тебя!!!
15:26 Bro allmost lost his hardcore world to water
Video idea :i built the backrooms
Best Rick roll ever
Слишком хорошее видео, но слишком мало лайков. ты достоин большего
Bro getting rick rolled at the 10 minute mark smh golden
This is what unemployment makes you do
<3 or i will steal ur video idea
40:17 bro thinks he can hide his feet from us
Can someone explain this bit? 33:13 Never heard of this mechanic
Come in Why didnt you show the destruction afterwards??? Fucking 40 min for this? Just to see a couple glimpses and your words that its 50 blocks deep... Wtf zoom out and show the whole crater
ты сумашедший!
reallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly long
what were the movies?
This was a movie
Bro you didnt save the world on another storage? Rookie mistake
I knew that it's going be a rickroll
If you used speed on yourself with the dolphin grace, you would have went A LOT faster
RIP that one chicken that was in the tnt💀
i just got rickrolled in this video bro....  edit: GOD DAMMIT I GOT RICKROLLED TWICE
*No chicken was harmed during the making of this video*
Omg wunba I also played with dominoes I saw your world record too so I have something…. Want to do a colab? Minecraft x domino chain reaction screen link? I haven’t experimented with dominoes for a while I fell like this is the best way to get back into dominoes
This is wild. People like you are why i still hold on to Minecraft.
TNT bigger than a nuke before gta6
I wanted to learn how to operate computers in my computer class but all I learned about was how to make your own website. Maybe I could've kept that for the sake of making a memesite. Also, loved the Brick Roll you gave us, it actually sounded funky.
So was he able to escape to the netherworld or something to survive?
around 10:19, did you really just do a rickroll?
UR A CUBER???????????????????????????????
not to be that guy but tnt explosions are far, far weaker than a nuclear bomb's explosion so this still isnt as powerful as a nuke, good vid tho.
you Americans are crazy for making these p Project. i love It editing and project. congrats for 1M sub
Okay man it was the greatest minecraft video that I've ever seen. You did a crazy job, man, i love it❤
Помню как давным давно, около 100 блоков тнт уничтожили мне оперативную память на пк.
i want a house on your server
It was so sure the music was a rickoll😅
ccccccccrrrrrraaazy
58430
DO YOU want to join my lan?
Bro rickrolled us
Now this is truly legendary.  May this video never be deleted by the ravages of time on technology, and may your legacy be truly eternal.
bro has a degree on yapping
No amount of obsidian and water layers can protect you from the irrecoverable lag spike that is about to occur.
the boldest decision in this video, by far, is including villager pathfinding logic in your Rube Goldberg machine.
I am just amazed at the effort and the sheer amount of time and hours that went in to this, He probably spent sun up till sundown on many occasions just placing blocks or grinding away for a resource all to blow it up in the end, which is awesome. HUGE congrats on 1 mil and I cant wait to see what comes next! LETS GO WUNBA
The rickroll before the explosion is ominous.
Bro you made a 2 megaton bomb which 1000 Kilotons=1megaton
remember to back up your world every few days so that you don't loose it again <3
What video editor do you use?
I cant believe this guy censored his feet. More that its a somewhat reasonable thing to do
I just got rickrolled 😅
I feel bad for your hardcore world
legend says the pizza man is still waiting...
Огромная уважуха от Ru комьюнити ❤❤❤
RIP Chicken, he paved the way for the Nuke's explosion, respect the chicken.
The video: 😎 The title: 🤓
No way I got Rick-Rolled like that
I haven't made a video for my channel in a while. This inspired me to create again, but I don't know what I'm going to make.
bro just rickrolled us in the most unexpected way ( 44:04)
Aww man my ssd also fried and my only hardcore world got corrupted and this happened twice
nice rick roll
we got rickrolled on the sec music note play through
45:28 the chicken made a noble sacrafice
bro, this was soooo goood you need way more followers
did he really rickroll us
Does this also count as the world's most complicated Rick Roll?
13:43 "Nucular Bomb"
dude... I'm... SO SHOCKED HOW POSSIBLE THIS IS!!!!! you have no idea how nice it is to watch your videos dude, I love watching your videos, I love your channel, I love you! dude, thank you for the video, thank you for the hours spent building this whole mechanism, thank you for everything ❤️
44:10 bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
10:02 made me cringe so much I had to quit and give this a dislike sheesh that really hurt me
You are insane and i love it!
Blockenhimer
It seems really good but the jumping subtitles are a downer for me :( . Why not use the youtube ones ?
bro built CaseOh
As Ozzy Osbourne said, "Thank God for the bomb "
wow all that and didnt see the end of the nuke going off, well that was a waste of time smfh
did u survive?
Auto crafters exist now
i dont comment on videos on youtube, but i had on this one after i saw the dedication you put in this video and the struggles you had to get through making this video possible, you earned a new sub and a like from me. Have a good day my friend.
He forgot to use depth strider 😂
Do you survive?
просто 1
😊😊😊😊
Is anyone gon talk about how he rick rolled us secretly?
In any minecraft hardcore world you can use cheats without efforts because the achievements will be still on so use /locate commands to find strongholds
show the whole explosion and the damage next time . thanks
Bro took no chances to did
villager is squid ward
everyone sub he deseves it ;)
Hi from Russia
I'LL DO 1000 PUSH UP IF YOU LIKE THIS COMMENT

Красавчик, что не сдался! )🤟👍
First Video i watched and I subscribed  Thank you
True to form about the amount of work for such a "short payoff", this was 46 minutes of amazing content, where the actual explosion was only shown for about 30 seconds.   Well done.
Called the rickroll from a mile away when you said that it was special.
Music is rickroll
A lot of work.... but no blast?!??   (I dont play Minecraft)
Well.... that sucked.
45:23 CHIKEN NOoOoOoOoOoOo

Bro rick-songed me
Too easy
46 minute long video to not even show the explosion lol...
ok
im subscribed
R.I.P the chicken
44:05 Bro really rickrolled a world record ;-;
For anyone who doesn't know how powerful this explosion was, he stated that the blast would be equivalent to 2,421 kilotons of TNT/2.421 megatons of TNT. For reference, the Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima had only 15 kilotons of TNT meaning that this blast is roughly 161 times more powerful than Little Boy or 121 times more powerful than Fat Man, the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. The explosion this man just made if recreated in real life would create a fireball 12.5km squared and a shockwave that expands outward roughly 784km squared. Good Man!
Bros spitting facts
Bro Spiting facts Whole Vid
19:13 You more than likely have your games (including your hardcore save) on your C drive, which holds your OS. The world more than likely got so big, it overloaded the storage and caused the OS to have issues booting.  A good way to avoid this in the future, is to install another SSD and move all your games there, and keep any documents or programs on your C drive. You should also have faster boot times with that as well, since your OS’s drive isn’t so bloated.   (This was like a huge shot in the dark, so my apologies if I’m not correct, PC nerd friends)   Edit: Alr he figured it out. But he should still put his games and their respective saves on a separate SSD just to be safe.
bro at 44:17 HE WANTS TO RICK ROLL US
WE JUST GOT RICK ROLLED
Not cool u blur the feet
didt anybody notice that his xp goes from 13290 to 11000???
Who can say where he said in the video never gona give you up?                Because I found where     in minute 10:2
Hey wait, im one of those TNT blocks :0
the second u said that ur going to build a song player i knew thats its gonna be rick roll
but the animals that died in this video... rip phantom: prob had the second worst death because he went in a pit of boats(there is a chance that is very small that he is alive) sacrifice chicken: this was the worst death because that chicken got fried from a giant tnt more bigger and powerful then a real life NUKE
WAIT TOTEMS CAN BLINK????????? 33:26 if this was a mod then i am sure i look insane
the chicken :(
WHAT KIND OF AUTO CLICKER IS THAT
Almost at 1.3m 3 weeks later youll hit it soon bro!
hey please here me out!! ill tell you something crazy...  your not gonna believe this! so i just waked up to see this 34:54  now i dont even know why im on this guys channel cause i remember myself falling asleep watching a video and when i woke up im in here and not just that! i missed all of his explanation and skipped in here where the im traumatized seeing such a loooooooong satisfying domino Real Life X Minecreaft idk now at this point so yeah i hope you see this comment    because of this accident im subscribing 😂❤ hi i guess?
I Will place 100 tnt for every like this comment gets
So let me get this straight... you fried a drive and by the skin of your teeth you didn't lose any data. Then you proceeded to NOT backup that data and lose it all only a few days later? That's called being an absolute idiot.
I wasted time :( but not much, cause I just fast forwarded to the end haha :)
Deidra from Naruto would be proud
almost bigger than the tzar bomba
What was your old motherboard? I want to know what not to buy as I'm building a new PC.
Instead of using water bucket, u can mine ice using silktouch and use it an a water, u onlyneed to break it thenit turn into water 😅

That is a crazy big explosion! You literally put Oppenheimer to shame!  You deserve more respect than you have!!! Your the best!!!😊
Hi wunba, Can i have your mod file. When i download mod by mod, It won't open my Minecraft?
Work smarter not harder: put all of your items in a shulker then put that shulker with multiple shulkers in one shulker and on and on and on
I just recently found your account and I wanna say js how amazing it is and how much hard work you put into your world your amazing
that's gotta be the shittiest "computer store guy" i've ever heard of
Hi plz love me
Never Gonna Give You UPPP!
You....can make clay. By drying out mud with a dripstone.
Guys he literally Rick roled us
As a none minecraft player.....I kinda expected a big boom -.-...

Did you survive?
that big tnt ate some mini tnt's
10:03 did bro just rickrolled us and AM I THE ONLY ONE SEEING THIS!??!??! 😭💀🙏 wow this guy deserves 10m subs like really this guy does the best content possible in youtube AS MINECRAFT?? PLUSS REAL LIFE? DAAAAAM edit: 13:01 bro is mrbeast but in minecraft content edit: 44:15 why
you are not oppenheimer, bub, whats with the need to make everything so irritatingly dramatic. this is a minecraft video
At 10:04 he Rickrolled us like we wouldn’t notice the only people that wouldn’t notice are 👂=❌❌
That new editor is insane
U r my Inspiration to keep on pushing myself to reach my dreams and goals no matter how much u have to work, no matter how much u have to go through, as long as ur passionate about it you’ll achieve it. Thanks wunba❤
No way bro Rick rolled me in a secret message 💀10:04
44:05 it’s fair
10:00 did bro just rick roll us? JUST LIKE THAT??
Ngl, I see no difference in using a mod to do player auto crafting & just enabling the crafter via the fabric mod, it would make for some serious fun Factorio style builds.
With the Rick rolls tho
I guess after we subscribed to him,he blew us away.
i just got rick-roll
did i just seriously get rickrolled
你🐱‍👤🐱‍👤🐱‍👤🐱‍👤🐱‍👤🐱‍👤🐱‍👤🐱‍👤🐱‍👤🐱‍👤🐱‍👤🐱‍👤
吧👍👍
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu❤❤❤❤❤❤
Your minecraft for sure crashed when you were blowing it up, so you loaded the backup and hollowed out the TNT and created a little "montage" and included ZERO live reaction. And you hollowed out the TNT so you could make a fake little montage. Absolutely NO SHOT your minecraft didn't crash. OWN UP to what you did and delete your world.
What a F**king troll. I wasted about 50 minutes to not even see a live reaction of when the TNT was blowing up. I really feel like you just hollowed out the middle of the TNT because minecraft crashed and you didn't want to lose your world like you said in the video. There's absolutely no way your computer didn't crash. You would need a NASA Supercomputer to handle that much TNT because minecraft TNT isn't very well optimized. And you didn't show a live reaction and the "montage" of the TNT exploding, you could only see the outside layer. I literally didn't see ANY tnt in the middle at all. Looked like a big TNT cube with just TNT around the outside.
That should take Soo long
Can't believe i got rickrolled by Wunba...
Can you make the titanic?
Love the new editor :D
Nice technoblade reference  "I have become death destroyer of worlds"
Yikes... Dominoes has given free food to Israeli military... and they're on the boycott list too 😬
44:10  I knew it. You had for-shadowing earlier in the video for what the song was gonna be
i thnk
I GOT RICKROLLED!BRO
Wunba rickrolled us 10:04
clearly a copy of mogswamps backstory. the whole domino channel story is the same in a mogswamp vid from 8 months ago
That was the most amazing chain reaction in Minecraft History, congratulations for a million subscribers you deserved it
you rickrolled us lol
I will do 0.0000000000000000000001 pushup every like thats 1 pushup every 100 quadrillon likes

AND IT'S ALL DONE IN CREATIVE MODE not survival basically cheating
Do you know where I can find my car's extended warrenty?
Holy crap
Are you survived
Did you die in the hardcore world?
Wow the hard work 💪💪💪
impossible to build nothing for wunba
Bro that was a violation 😂
26:53 Bro's A Rubik's cuber????
It is very interesting that between cuts he magically loses 2000 xp levels then regains it just to magically lose it again 4:24 to 4:36
Why not you just build a chunckloader (although that's just me and they might have fixed it cus I'm cluesss)
The amount of patience this man has.
I would play the song, but lets sa- let me save your time, rickroll
WUNBA YOU HAVE TO DO THE WORDAL TODAY GET ON STREAM LETS GO

Bros editor is amazing
why am i the only one who noticed he rickrolled us at 10:04
Y'all can skip to the important part of the video, the detonation in 45:19 . And skip all his mumbling nonsense story that gives him 10K dislikes cause, he's too long-winded-ly boring.  Thank me later.
he rick rolled us 10:00 min in
Did you put the jort storm instrumental as the background music when building the redstone contraptions
10:03 Rick Roll... and 44:07
I will get 20 electric shocks for every like this gets
At seconds 20:23 just all you need to do is stsrt taking breaks so your pc doesnt crash
These in person angles kill me they are so unnecessary. I will die by this
I just want to give you mad respect for turning what should have been a 1 minute short into a full feature length 47 minute video.  I wish I had someone like you who could bloviate as hard through university.
Get a lot of friends to join to help!!!
bruh who got the rickroll
Rick roll?
W editor
Why did you put MULTIPLE rick rolls in this, I'm not emotionally prepared for things like this.  Take my thumbs up and a sub...

poor chicken
60 block a sec will take you 16,666.66666666667 Hours (Math Is A Liltal Offie)
let us appreciate him, bcs i would give up after fifteen minutes
Maybe I missed it - but did you die at the end? live? We didn't get to see your player inside the obs box as the explosion was going off at the time? Just curious how all that part worked out for you?

Hey Wunba did you know you can enchant a pickaxe with fortune and silk touch at the same time along with other thing without mods and commands when you are in the ps4 edition of MC, also love the vids and streems. :)
background music = Jort storm???? 23 minutes???
Bro literally could have started a multi billion company with all the time he has put it to this world. No hate by the way love the vids ❤❤❤
My man is actually way to underrated

dang I remember when wunba had 20k subs
Hi
CONGRATS WUNBA
No one will believe me but i predicted it was gonna be a rick roll while watching
That music is so inspirational. Such a classic piece of Astley cheesiness that it's got over 2 billion views it's an international rule t shame the person if they accidentally listen to it and its a mf'ing multiversal meme.
POV: Me after my brother kills my dog in Minecraft:
Never gonna give you up 😂
WoooooooooooW

Shoutouts to Jason the 🐐.
i made one but was 0nly 8,000 tnt in my minecraft but i never got to explode it
Doing this in survival?! That's insane.
H O P P E R S
You should make the worlds biggest sand farm
this is just genious, im speechless
Best rick roll ever :P
So you're detonating 1,300,000 blocks of TNT. According to a Quora question, each block of TNT weighs about 1,650 kilograms which means about 2,145,000 tons of TNT which in explosive yield is either 2,145 kilotons or 2.1 megatons. For reference, the B83 Nuclear Bomb is the most powerful U.S. thermonuclear weapon still in service with a max dial-a-yield of 1.2 megatons. Operation Ivy's King shot was a 500 kt super-orally bomb and the largest pure fission device ever tested while Mike shot was 10.4 megatons. EDIT: Oh, you did it at 13:20
Can you YouTubers PLEASE just stock up on materials off camera? It'd make the viewers and your guys' lives so much easier.
I will do 1 pushup for every like!!!!!!!!!!!
I will do 1pushup for every comment I get!!!!!
The phantom got shipped away

Wumba show us the part after all the tnt blew up please!
Bro just rickrolled me
guys lets take a moment to appreciate his effort in making this
Hi there when you where building the tnt did you get that amazing filling of when each tnt added it felt like a subscriber added I feel like building the tnt was an example of building this amazing channel you came a long way and I’m glad that I’ve subscribed to your channel keep up the good work man
The rickroll
10:03 - 10:15 i thought this was a secret code lmao
this, is amazing. the video, the expalining, the cinetogrophy, all of it, is so good. kinda inspres me to try and beat the record myself possibly
The fact that bro had enough tnt to destroy one bedroom i crazy
Expected the rick roll
"A month ago I uploaded my world" So it took you a month to do 15 hours of building?
wait wait wait wait.. does the storage machine have hoppers??
What's really crazy is that that's only two megatons of TNT the strongest bomb we have is over 100 megatons of TNT that is so much Minecraft TNT I'm pretty sure that's over a billion
You sound like skip tutorial
I love the juck box so much nwo that i wach it 😊😊😊😊😉😉😉😉
This is real quality content. (I can’t stop weighting comments)
Do you like dirt bc your useing it alot in this vid 🐣🐥🦄🦄😅🤣😂😊😊😊
i think that minecraft youtubers are going insane
Dude ... backups... this is part of your livelihood. Make. Some. Fucking. Backups. You don't drive without a seatbelt, do you? While you are at it, throw in a RAID1, so you can keep going one dead drive. also, nvme is a waste of money for gaming. Or at least the ultra newest ones are.
never gonna give you up
I will die in Minecraft for every like this comment gets
12:55 you have a woodenx axe in your hotbar. Do you use world edit?

I only clicked on this video cause I couldn’t find anything else to watch and YT kept recommending it to me. I was not expecting it to be this insanely good.👍 that was incredible.
The orange words mean I never gonna give you up nvm You probably already figured that out😢 I’m useless asking for a friend
Watch till the end at your own risk
not even gonna properly show the aftermath 😑
44:06 he richroll us
You could of gone in creative mode
Are you not going to show us the crater during daytime.....
poor chicken
what auto clicker are you using?
Realy good video and you spend a lot of time for it. But can i ask where can i find your 1st or 3rd video from this hardcore
All YouTubers say they are going to do a world record for whatever, but I have seen and made much bigger explosions than that
Im gonna be disappointed if the music box isn't playing TNT by ACDC.
nice
i remember there used to be a setting on the minecraft thing when u make the world and the entire world turns into tnt and when i exploded my computer exploded
Did I just get rickrolled?

Tf was the point of that you barely focused on the aftermath
44:07 bro rickrolled us 🤡☠️
Then how did you get the footage back from the so called 'fried nvme ssd' ??????????????????
i have seen some impressive things in my years. being around when yt started to videos like this. there are few words to describe this but the one that comes to mind is epic dedication! well thats 2 words lol
see the full video for the TNT idea: ❌ see the video for the totam blink: ✅
Guys go to 10:03 lol😂😂😂
Insane dedication, great job dude. At the same time: My brother in christ, how did you not think to make a backup of your data after the first drive got fried?
im starting to think the minecraft water bucket sound came from cookie clicker
44:13 AH **** HERE WE GO AGAIN >=(
12:54 wait a minute why did you have a wooden axe in your inventory 🤔
I'm glad to see an Etho reference :)
wanted to see more of the after.....didnt get to see nothing really of the explosion and the hole

Im suprised no body commented at 29:52 with the eggs being stacked to 64 😂
This was insane 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳

Don’t chunk ban yourself
the second he even mentioned jukeboxes i new it was gonna be a rickroll
šrfčtčrhčťšz
how he cried during the data loss was so funny🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
what about the old superflat worlds on Playstation that you were able to make a fully custom world made out of tnt? Wouldnt that be the biggest ever tnt explosion in minecraft?
what auto clicker do you use
Minecraft creators making crazier and crazier builts ever
Dude. Why don’t you have one or more 4TB external SSDs connected to your computer doing hourly backups? (Also, while SSDs are faster, HDD are more likely to be easier to recover if something goes wrong.) You could also set up a cloud backup as well.
Hands down this is the the best minecraft video i've ever seen
Can't tell if it was satisfying or not.
I watched this shit not to get to see the results
Anyone got that music from 20:55 ? Cause damn that track slaps.
Me: totem blinking You:ahhh my totem is blinking!!!!!
Day 3 asking to build a starwars spaceship
do you have autism?
Lol
Hi

i bought your patreon and i got the world file but i dont know what to do after can you or someone else help me with this?
It astounds me how many people don't keep backups or mirror images of hard drives housing their important stuff.

This was the biggest anticlimax I've ever seen online.

NEVER                                                                                                                                                   GONNA                                                                                   GIVE                                                                                                      YOU                                                                                                            UP :)
This is impressive.  When I was a kid, I built chain reactions just like you did. Also, a while back, I made several Minecraft chain reactions, so I understand this video very well.  Even more impressive is how you got a pizza delivery man to be a part of it.
انا العربي الوحيد هنا ؟
You look like Wonka
Why’s there another wunba😂  41:06

Wow its exactly on 100.000 Likes

Bro have u seen ExplodingTnT💀
39:29 DID YOUR TOTEM JUST BLINK AT ME
Bros PC got fried BEFORE he exploded the TNT that just goes to show how nervous your PC got before you even lit the candle LOL
goooooo
Noooo that was your hard work ❤
Love the hidden message in the list of items you gather for the sand storage system. 10:00
Ok this is so crazy. You really are the king of Minecraft Hardcore to me
bro literally played Rick Roll as the song
10:57 - 11:00 there are eyes behind him
... 😢 He almost quit his stream
He just rick roold us😂
Congratulations on 1,000,000 subscribers!
Cant believe i got rick rolled again

this really feels detail-to-detail exactly like a Mr. Beast video
I didn't even realize I watched 46 whole minutes... TOP TIER EDITING!!
So nobody’s going to talk about how he is over level 11000💀
What software is this 0:57? Is that just excel is that a modpack?
thanks for giving us tribute Wunba 👑
I LITTERLY SAID TO MYSELF THAT HE WOULD RICK ROLL ME AT THE END!!!!!!!!!!!!
suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Bro just Rick rolled us 44:06
I ate pizza😂
Anybody noticed the rickroll ablut in 8th minute in the video? "Give you up"
I've been watching mine craft videos on and off for 11 years. Safe to say, just about everything out there now is people exploiting mechanics to build crazy stuff... And it. is. hilarious. And fantastic.
all of this is better than oppenheimer
ur video is so cool
Super fun video that I can sit and watch with my son. Thanks for keeping it fun and most importantly thanks for keeping it clean. Too many YouTubers out there don't consider the kids who like to watch their content.
I had the same thing that my pc just froze and i did reset my pc like 4 times then i just turned my pc off and waited a couple of minutes then i turned it on again and it worked
I will do 10 push up on every like this commet gets im actullay not joking
I couldn't believe you didn't show the crate
You should make a cherry tree house or mega thing cause you have never done that
Bro Rick rolled us all
so you didn't really say if the survival precautions worked. and was it your alt account to witness the blast for that footage? will there be a link to a video showing comparisons before and after of the blast area? you mentioned what was found but it didn't really show the scope of the aftermath.
This is what i call 'Risk it for the biscuit'
Didnt minecraft add an autocrafter? XD
make a nuwk
hidden rickroll
I'm gonna subscribe, this video was really epic!
I’ll do 1 push  up for every like this comment gets
NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN
who else thought it was gonna be a rickroll
This guy is smart dam !
Bro is the Mrbeast of Minecraft 😂
I think this guy might know how to minecraft

#6B8192 just equals gray blue.

44:15 best way to rickroll someone, also, WHY DID YOU DO THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!
U have a great new editor 5/5
The Rick roll is crazy
My respect for the dominos pizza guy 📈
Did that blast hurt the chicken
i sav the dominos channel!
This is the most fun I've had a Minecraft in a long time..
WTF 90 minutes at 45:39
Imagine a creeper just passing by while waiting for the triggers...
the transition from rube goldberg irl to rube goldberg in minecraft
you will be remeberd chicken creeper frog and villager
did we just get rickrolled?
45:28 subspace minecraft trapmine
44:20 you just got rickrolled
my first meme on yt got copyrighted but not striked
bro the music at 44:25 was 💀💀💀 and what i mean is it was rickroll
10:17 rickrolled
JackFrostMiner Just Upload a new video
Wunba I would recommend to change your hard core world to a regular survival world. I would hate to see you lose your world and hardcore worlds are not what makes people click your videos its the insanity of your builds
We got rickroled
2:56 good reference wunba
why does his xp levels keep on swapping between 13k levels and 11k levels...
DID HE LIVE IM SO NERVOUS
he rickrolled us.....
Ngl this was one of the best minecraft videos I've ever seen! But I feel like you should have shown the aftermath for a bit longer!
Wunba rickrolled me...
the secret messeges nevwe gonna give u up
As a minecraft player that started in beta 1,4 and a person who loves to see massive explosions I totally approve of this Nuke,its so heckin epic and your editor did your project justice too(except the text,it was a bit too fast sometimes) 9,9/10 (tier rating: PERFECT [9,5 or above])
The part where he dropped his PC into a gigantic fryer blew my mind. I never thought I would see metal react that way.
Wait, so you had a near death PC crash that could've lost everything. Had it fixed, then just continued placing TNT? Bruh. Back that shit up lol.
I hear Rick rolled 💀
I can’t beleive I actually watched that entire thing 😮
why do every minecraft youtuber pretend to play hardcore?
7:32 what song name?
It was a bit "fun"
Wumbo
Bro names every mobs Skavio😂😂
He rickrolled us in minute ten
the tnt is going to make an explosion as large as the in-game explosion
Two rick roll means two likes for him
the same happened to my pc how do i make it work
I GOT THE NUMBER 750!!!!
He said never gunna give u up 10:02
why?
who saw the totem blink  ⬇
The TNT in minecraft isn't as powerfull as irl
Why was your totem of undying blinking?
Why was your totem of undying blinking?
The amount of effort you put into this is so inspiring, amazing project!!
7 year olds when they see a single village:
man put rube gulbrd to shame
bruh
What Should We Call The Crater?
did you survive
Nice work
saw the music coming from a MILE away. banger song though!
11:55 autocrafter would be dissapointed
Nice build.
2weeks for .2million more subs
wow, what a video. congrats for 1,000,000
😊
Humans: "Bro, waiting 90 mins to see the full result of the massive explosion? sick!"  God: "Damn quantum pc and this sublight RAM, I've waited for 14B years; finish rendering the Big Bang's destruction for Me's sake!!!"
Funniest part 😂 44:05
why did you rickroll in the middle of the collecting materials for the collection system like whayyyyyyyyy im madddddd @Wunba
10:05 the hidden rickroll
32:58  please dont rick roll me again
10:05 Got Rick-Rolled..
Gg
I hate sand
this made me remember a old video of people making a big tnt block and filling it with tnt and exploding it
Imagine if you lost the world just bc of your HDD going bad.... i would've broken something if i lost my world
ill do 1 pushup every like this commect gets
Is the explosion going to be one billion that would be crazy bro
I'm definitely unsubing for the rickroll
I really loved this, and especially the chain reaction part. Reminds me of domino in minecraft and I'll even consider using some of those myself, so thanks. I also had a very dumb idea as a challenge I wanted to let you know about. When a mob spawns with a durability item, it can sometimes drop, but then it can sometimes have a durability of 0. This is normally impossible because it only goes down to 1, making some items pretty rare if you get them like that. If you want to do this, I can reply or something with a list of all the possible ones to get.
Day 1 of asking to find every pot type
story= do overclock for minecraft
Me who did this before him in my hardcore world  Wait is he copying me wait how will he copy me huh hu hu es ju wut
45:52
this is so underrated you deserve more subs
We got Rick rolled
Why did i got rick rolled
You are truly one of a kind, pls keep up the good work 🔥🔥
Make daytime in the end
Stevenheimer
45:20 That's when the bomb actually goes off
😁 👕 👖 👟👟
nahh just got rickroll'd at the end lol
the pc issue ur telling me that on the fact of how fast u were building that ur storage  just exploded? like bro how i have this pc for 5 years and i did the same thing and nothinh happened similar only with my gpu that catched fire but we dont talk about that
If you  nuke it in real life, its power is the same as the first hydryogen bomb in 1955
i like your vids but this is 13 days ago
You are the death X130
wait did he die
That is not a atomic bomb its a hydryogen bomb, and the frist hydryogen bomb in 1955 is 130 times bigger than the atomic bomb.
I think it's time to learn python/java
12:59 the animation😶🥵
Amazing videos
The setup was just as intense as the outcome(s) were unsatisfying  Pretty sad...
I KNEW IT WAS THE RICK ROLL MUSIC AT THE END, cool video :D
are your PC is OK
turned off night mode and put it in theatre mode just to absorb the full epicness of the final act of this video and what a soundtrack too  Wunba you bloody ripper
3:10 11979000 sand and gunpowder
I have to admit, I was hoping one of the 'Legendary' fuse stages was going to be some super-complicated redstone circuitry that was something like a 4-bit binary multiplier (perhaps a Dada multiplier so it wouldn't be too slow, nor take up too much space), or even just a binary adder (perhaps a lookahead adder using pistons as transistors in the style of a 'Manchester carry chain').  Still, really cool project! Congrats on the world record. I think my favorite part was the inclusion of not just real life dominoes, but also real life marbles; those were some really cool contraptions you built.
People who claimed a piece of tnt 👇
I decided to Subscribe, because of the dedication to your fans, and the struggle you went through when the board in your computer fried, and all the time spent on this. You're welcome!
Imagine if a lightning struck and exploded it all
That was the greatest Rick-roll of all time😂
pov me breaking this record on my custom super flat in 2013
ia anybody not talkibg the way he rickrolled us?
Unbelievable 👌😎
Waiter: where shall I cook your steak Pov: On my pc pls.
This was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Subscribed
Why am I watching this the day before I go to Hiroshima
40:17 so sad the world has come to blurring your feet. people are weird.
could hardly see what was happeningfrom the views you had lmao
Wunba literally had one of the greatest comebacks i can ever think of
why does this video have nearly 10k dislikes?!
Build the sears tower in your hardcore world
10:20 please do not say the orange words
man have some rest!
The fact that I watched for 40 minutes just to get rickrolled is insane 44:06
oh by the way *HOPPERS*
What happened to the pizza man
Bro ruins the video by talking over the end and explaining everything we are watching in real time back to us. Like I don’t need to know about how the marble is rolling down the ramp. I can see it.  Annoying
Wow I remember those dominos videos you made I just didn't know you were the same guy making this channel. I just found it too!! Way to go man props!👏👍
So this was Hiroshima in 1945, huh.
i don't want your channel to end can you try to be at least a different youtuber like a geometry dash youtuber if the channel gets beats 1,000,200 subs please? :)
All that work for such a small outcome? I expected more. But that means nothing coming from me as I’ve never participated in Minecraft. 😅
Eae wunba blz man you can leave your map to download for us you can do this
45.18 respect for the chicken
I don't know about you guys, but I love when youtubers include some real life "clips" like he did into their videos! Great Video man, keep goin:D
Congratulations.
Poor pc
I freaking knew it would be a rick roll
respect to this man for keeping his biggest promise and literally wasting his life time for us to enjoy if ur seeing this sub to this guy
You can hear bro suffering 😢
so did you survive?
I called it the rickroll I knew it when you talked about it I just knew that it was a rickroll
bro better than most minecraft players nowadays
did he forget about the pizza?
10:03 Rickroll Alert😅
24:50 I may be wrong but i might have watched one of those videos  as  idk i just loved watching chain reactions i guess
WHAT movie did you watch
10:03 this whole section is for a single rick roll. I didn't know I could be so proud of someone I've never watched before...
Don't you dare Rick roll me mister wunba
Just realised how long I've been watching him unintentionally with the dominoes section 😂
I am at 12:00 mark and I am dead.... How this guy has so much patience and the editor too 😢😮
Your motherboard is power af it caried 2k+ kilotons LOL
Did nobody see that he Rick rolled us while collecting the items
44:06 bruh I did not expect that
Я СБРОШУ НА ВАС 250 ТЫСЯЧ ТОНН ТРАТИЛА
i WAS going to say this isn't an accurate nuke cuz a nuke squeezes magic rock to make boom but then i realized the title says "Mathematially accurate" not "Scientifically accurate" POV: Wumba's ISP after searching "How much does 1m cube of tnt weigh" and "How much power does 1650KG of tnt have" Also again you reallllly like music made by AGST lol
19:00
Not me just noticing that the totem blinks qwq
At first i thought the creeper fireworks were swatstikas😂😂
When I was younger I used to binge your old channel, its sick coming back years later to your new one
World Record
" now I have become death, the distorter of worlds..."
R.I.P Charles the chicken
2:43 pov: yelling when everyone is asleep
If I lost something I was working on for actual years at this point, I would’ve genuinely considered quitting too. I can’t imagine the feeling of grief, stress, and anxiety that was coursing through you. I’m so sorry you even had to endure it. Thank fing god you had a world download. So glad you didn’t succumb. Congrats to you.
wunba dies in next video btw prediction ☠️☠️☠️
wait your rent????
I will listen to 48 hours of Thomas the tank engine remix if this video gets 2000 likes
i really wanna see whats remaining of your world! can you please answer if you are going to make a video about that? i would love that!
Bro dropped the Rick Astley bomb (nuke) in the end in the most ingenious way possible
I just noticed totem blinks..........
I don’t want to join to unlock the world can you add free a dl link in the comments ore description as well bc I don’t want to give you money to get the world.
When is the next video, i have been binge watching your series this past week, waiting for the next vid
Nice now when you reach 2m do it again
yooooo this was sooo big i love ur videos👍👍
I'm surprised the PC survived
I will do 69 press ups for every like this comment gets
NUCLEAR. NEW. CLEAR.  new klee ur  Other than that, AMAZING video. This is insane.
I was starting to enjoy this video, then the ad appeared
Why is there an second wunba at 41:06? and Wunba joined the game on 40:13??
Why did you have to rick roll us all? 44:38
ILOVE YOUR VID I WATCH IT EVERY DAY ITS AMAZING
Hi Wunba, you just got yourself a new subscriber
Yooo nice
See I love that your background music is the audio for Jort Storm. Its rlly noticable during the beacon building bit of the chain reaction. Its awesome ^-^
You realized the importance of backups? Or are you still keeping all your data on a single SSD and praying to your favorite deity?
wow i liked the music
No, not more powerful. Only larger in volume than the TNT equivalent.
Best video ever so cool love it. You should do it again but with creepers.
2:54 wrong type of your. should have been you’re
If you haven't covered the Grass Block Farm yet (in the End, from the Farlands video), it kinda has the shape of a Star Wars Imperial Ship, the triangular one with the bridge higher, to me, and i'd like to see that, it also goes well with the surroundings
shimmy shimmy yay shimmy yay shimmy ya drank shalalalala drank shalalalaa
Why was there not a detailed aftermath? I wanted to see a detailed after all of these things. Anyways good video but an aftermath could have made it perfect since i was looking forward to the results of the explosion.
Whats the point of a hardcore world if you can just die and then re download the map.   Not that you did it just seems a little off
bro really recreated a nuke and can't spell foreshadowing
That pizza delivery guy will go down in history. (This comment is made by Holden Pope)
The use of the Oppenheimer soundtrack made this so hype.
Those who got rick rolled press like😂😂
probably your computer froze because of how much TNT you placed ):
Never gonna give you up
As a german I am just happy for the Castcrafter shotout
This Comment Wont Get 10 Likes (Make It Get 1k Pleaseeeee)
Cool! I would have liked to see a bit more of a flyover of the mega crater. But the effort into the process was insane. And appreciated.
This is the type of video we have been searching for since prime DanTDM
10:10 literally the rickroll
wow all of that for tnt ...
Cashh
God Oppenheimer😂 13:30
No way Castcrafter is in the video!
Awsome
Rip Skavio:(
🎉❤😮
how rich is wunba? rich enough to take lava away with emerald blocks 7:59
That was the craziest 1 millionth subscriber speical video. Btw did you lose your computer again?
Why? just why?
The guy has PhD in stalling and yapping
I wonder when will the world download be aivable
The pizza delivery guy is officially a legend.
Rip YouTubers that watch this
We just got rick rolled
bro spen Day and to destroy
2016 is when i was born
got rickrolled
DONT EVER RICK ROLL ME AGAIN OR IM UNSUBSCRIBING!!!!!
I love how the computer fried itself before the giant TNT was even exploded 😂
noice
Why at 41:06 there is a second wumba ? neat detail( oh wait that was his alt)
Just imagine if a creeper accidentally exploded inside or a lightning bolt hits the build
bro thought he was slick with that rickroll 10:03 look at the orange text
Your voice makes me thirsty
Bro's screen time is more than minecraft took to be developed 💀
My guy really went out of his way to rick roll us. 10:05 - 10:12
Get Rick Rolled at. 44:05
19:00 so you fried your ssd and didnt save all the files before continuing with the thing that fried your ssd?
Show some more of the crater
Congratulations on 1.2 mil 🎉🎉🎉🎉
the orange words at 46:19
forgs eat slime cubes
ah yes, msi being shitty all over again
creators like you need a double ender chest
18:28 you must have some mods then, since Minecraft runs at 20 ticks per second so you can’t do things in smaller increments than that
Please tell me you signed up for BackBlaze backup service. It hurts my IT guy's heart.
Let such bombs explode only in games and bring pleasure.
Litteraly the second Oppenheimer.
Your next video should be just building a regular house
It was the weirdest rickroll I've ever experienced.
1 like = i 🙏 for the chicken
Legend says Jason’s still waiting to give Wunba his pizza…
I would always have multiple backups of this world in so many different places to prevent corruption and everytime I got offline, would upload them
And so i placed hours? 16:27
of all the songs in the world. why that one, but i cant even be mad, hat wase a nice troll
Bro built a bomb in minecraft and a bomb out of his computer.
nice
Wooooow.....what a horrible ending...didnt show it live, hardly showed the aftermath, didnt showed if you lived or died....cant believe i just wasted ao much time for such an unsatisfying outcome
supersmartmtf
I watched all that for a few seconds of the explosion? Wheres the aftermath?
How do you not have an auto backup to a separate harddrive set up? And really? You just forgot you had a backup uploaded to Patreon? Its insulting to think anyone would buy that story. It was a shitty situation. You lost a few days of work. But playing it up, saying you thought about deleting your whole channel? Come on man. The fabricated drama is weak.
I filled up the whole world with TNT before
Wait... did youbsirvive😢
GOOD JOB
Never 10:04 gona 10:06 give 10:08 you 10:10 up 10:11 is that a rick roll?
Did anything survive
congrates for 1 million subs🥳🥳
Bro what autoclick did you use😮
Hey @Wunba definitely wanted to say an extremely well done for 1 million subscribers, I have been here since 327K and you have grown so much. You should 100% be proud of everything you do! also, after all that, do you agree with my name?
The only interesting thing is the domino effect contraptions. The actual explosion itself is not a world record so it's sort of clickbait
Just planning tnt almost Fries my PC
Give Me All your Money
hello wunba you can dupeclate tnt
uhh the tasr bomba is 57 mega tons of thermo nuclear explosion . so ya
Did you know that there is a mod for TES IV: Oblivion where you can order a pizza from in the game. It currently only works for the US and even then it might be limited but ya know... it's cool
In in 10:00 listen to the orange words u will be amazed
as it exploded, my only thought was: "poor chicken"
Alright, he definitely deserves the views for this holy shit. The Scicraft server thinks that was ridiculously over the top and they built a 100+k/hr BAT FARM
31:35 🤨🤨🤨
19:53 Oh jesus christ man just use some youtube money on a onedrive or google cloud or SOMETHING. My minecraft world folder is synced permanently lol
17:35 I love that Mojang gets FREAKED OUT about people accidentally hurting animals based on something the see in game. And yet somewhere some idiot is locking a dolphin in an aquarium because they saw on minecraft that if they get exposed to air they die...
Now the challenge to have every mob set that TnT off. Good Luck!
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsrxrOtjmWnH5FJhJnkTRBg
4090 giving 78FPS😅
Sure, it beats the average tactical nuke, but I wanna see a sequel with 50 million blocks to equal the Tsar Bomba now...
All that and we didn’t even see the whole crater… I feel kinda robbed ngl
First Wunba video I've seen and I love this content. The editing is god-tier and he goes to insane lengths to accomplish something genuinely enormous
Hey wumba if you see this pls use this tip
at the noteblock thing we were rick roled xD
kingsammelot moment:0000 6:17
Man I really don't want to be rude but you're so cosmically dumb for not backing up your data. Also consider getting a second ssd and pair them both in raid 1. In this configuration either one can die and your data will be safe.
did suvive
I knew it's gonna be a rickroll. 44:07
💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥https://www.youtube.com/s/gaming/emoji/7ff574f2/emoji_u1f4ac.png
Bro what the hell the most TNT I've ever had in hardcore was 6400 what the fuck is this?
Tnt go boom 💥
BRO RICKROLLED US
That IT guy screwed you. He should've realized the motherboard wasn't properly compatible, if not the first time you took it in then on the second.
Love the new editor!
I will do 0.0001 pushups for every like
this is fucking amazing
Dude why did I watch the whole 46 mins?! Very well done! Keep up the great content!
I think Wumba really like Christopher Nolan movies, I mean mans has built an entire black hole based off Interstellar, and a atomic bomb based of Oppenheimer. Let bro cook 🔥🔥🔥
What’s 2016 I was born in 2016 do you love this YouTuber Womble
Im here to pay respect❤🔥😊
I wanna be in a video
*1*
a house in your minecraft world for a poster is like the coolest reward for any sweepstakes ive heard of
Its gonna be never gonna give you up isn't it... CALLED IT!!!
Average American opinion: large explosions are satisfying but they are too small 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
love you
So, lesson: remember to back everything up!
Bro's a nerd
All this effort... of watching this video just to get rickrolled
It's nice to know that we all have a giant square-shaped hole down to bedrock
Anticlimactic
The fact i new i was gonna get rickrolled is insanity
yeah i think that was worth a subscribe
Me wondering if he died
Are you serious right now?
chat gpt, give me minecraft autogenerate code for 2000000000x200000000x20000000000000 cube of tnt, 3 sec done
got a rainbow lightdome ... :D
WOW 🎉
Did I really just get rickrolled 10:04 and ending at 10:15
Is it satisfying 🤔
29:52 seeing stacks of 64 eggs hurts me
Bro mrbeest oh nah
it would be so sad (and funny) if he died to fricken falling on the floor of the tnt
Ill do one better i want to make myself hurt so i will do 10 push ups for each subscriber 2 channels have of your choice
that was epic
I saw that never go a give you up bit Solomon never gonna give you up never gonna let you down never gonna run around and desert you never gonna let you cry never gonna say goodbye 🖕
I think we get it. It's satisfying.
Hey...back up your shite. Lesson learned. Same thing happened to me.
I mean it's the same effort fora real nuke 💀
45:55
45:55: why do the clouds look like that?
he just put 2 rickrolles in it
why did i know what song it was
Bruh actually became destroyer of thw worlds like r.i.p that poor village it was totally annihilated exterminated roasted cooked and thrown in the waste
Hi! I doubt you'll ever read this, but in case you do, you should take a look at setting up a private Network Attached Storage (NAS) server with automatic backups of your important files in case of a catastrophic failure happening again in the future! That way even if you were to lose the main drive, you'll at least have those automatic backups set up on whatever intervals you decide to set them up on. There's other ways you can be more secure about your data with but that's the most crucial one. On top of having those backups, you can have the extra storage as mass-storage for footage (or whatever you might need to store long-term). The NAS is a good safety measure to have, but I hope you never need it!
Bruh nobody is competing with this anytime soon if they do then ur #&%¢$£ up
I WILL OPEN A POKEMON SHOP IF THIS COMMENT GITS 10000000 LIKES
what movies did you watch?
But did you die?
No way you don't cheat and actually do this on survival
Did I just get rickrolled?
Need to have the entire thing underground to see its true blast potential
Fly away big brain move
this video reminded me of jelly's marble race... the good times of childhood
Stop making everything so fucking dramatic
I'm going to start disliking videos because YouTube is putting in way too many long ads. It's getting ridiculous. I don't want to watch 5 minutes of ads in total over the video. This is ridiculous
Never gonna give you up as well wunba
you have the same editor as Mrbeast
9:50 "hoppers, chests, hoppers, paths, hoppers, hoppers, hoppers, and hoppers".
No one: sand generator is cheating!
@castcrafter 33:54 min
Wunba: *afraid the TNT will crash his world *builds a literal lag machine for the setup anyway.
Touch grass on your desk
That song was awesome 😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤
The fact that he went above and beyond hut for 1 milion subs is crazy he has to be my favorite youtuber
.....I'm always shocked at the sheer dedication, maths, time, and perseverance of hardcore world players setting up challenges for themselves.  All I can do is sub, like, and share- which feels like a very MEAGER thing in regard to all that work.
THIS IS THE BEST MINECRAFT VIDEO I'VE EVER WATCHED
I fucking hate you for Rick rolling in 2024 you wasted so much potential with that
This Video is so cool please never stop making Videos! ❤👍 😊 by the way what mod or ? Do you use at 1:00 because you can see the things in the shulker😅
Amazing work on this, shows a lot of dedication and skill
Dude this nuke in real life would be 2 megatons 💀
did anyone notice the totem blinking?
44:08 bro did you really have to do that 🤨🧐👀🧐🤨🧐🤨🧐🤨🤨
Bro we got rickrolled so causualy
nice
That is one TANK of a PC to survive all the particles, entities, block updates, falling blocks, and the explosion!
Bro actually Rick Rolled us XD
Best part is that this isn't even close to as powerful as a real nuke.
No footage of coming out of the obsidian chamber to see the carnage?  Did you die?
Did u die???
Now I know why I heard so many number 13 it is because he exploded 1,300000 m into 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Bro thinks hes Oppenheimer in minecraft 💀
U suffered
Incredible!!! I've never seen a more dedicated YouTube than you Wunba, congrats on 1 Million subscribers!!
The dedication deserves at least a sub from everybody who likes this comment!
I'm sorry, but how is this even remotely mathematically or scientifically accurate for a nuke? It's just a TnT cube strapped to a Rube Golberg firing mechanism. Normally I am very impressed with the scale and creativity of your builds but this, just isn't it. And improperly calling it "scientifically" or "mathematically" accurate is really just rubbing salt in the wound for how little this project distinguishes itself from the countless videos of people blowing up a TnT cube and calling it a nuke.
i will do 1 pushup every subscriber i get from this comment (on stream)live on my channel❤love from nepal
Man the music at the end gave me chills
Is you die?
You should buy a NAS and create automatic backups of your storage. I'd never want to lose everything like that.
Man went from stacking domino's to stacking minecraft blocks xD
25:05 - Don't we all gamers? I finally discovered why I still play Swordburst 2 with it's 0.1% drop rates.
@wumba please create a start to end cinematic and upload it it will be very cool to see everything with perfect time and angle and with perfect lights and commentory or song this will be epic
press f to pay respect to the chicken.
Bro i got it yayyy❤❤
Dude , stop wasting so much time playing minecraft..really go outside or something
I loved jort storm playing in the background
2:43 whats this about?
His PC fried before he even blew up a single TNT
Wunba is the Mark Rober of the Minecraft world and I am here for it!
Cool
nah, bro rly just rickrolled all 2milion of us watching during a world record chain reaction
i appreciate
Would have been cool to see some of the aftermath. I don't normally watch Minecraft videos. Not sure I'm necessarily the target audience but this was pretty entertaining.
rick roll
Well done!
NOOO NOT A RICK ROLL DUDE NOT COOL 😭😭😭
If you just found this and you wanna skip to the point go to 45:08
10:04 I can’t believe we really just got Rick rolled
Anticlimactic glad i just skipped to the end
someone needs to make one more powerful than the tsar bomba
After the first time it fried I would have killed the dolphin when I got back since the fast method did not have problems
I did something like this
Bro rickrolled more than 2 million people
Bro thinks he’s Fred building a trap in scooby doo
This video is a masterclass
YOOOOO WUNBA HAS GRAVITRAX
"legalize nuclear bombs" wunba:
I seen reactor explosions
44:06 NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Disclaimer!!! No withers we’re harmed in the making of this video.😅😅😊
Nice job 🎉🎉🎉
the unemployed friend on a random tuesday
Hi. This is my first time seeing one of your videos… heads up. Flash warning for the time lapses with the day/night cycles.
1 million and yet he can't pay an artist for the poster...
bro is a grinder, his devotion is insane
I laughed with joy at all the madness contained in this video.
The pizza part made me LOL
Also... there's no clip of you emerging from your cave, still alive? :( That ended somewhat anticlimactically
Wait. it doesn't show the actual explosion causing damage? Just it falling apart then the aftermath? :(
Why would one do this?
the secret message: peaple who know ):< peaple who dont know(:
Bro really put Oppenheimer Music 13:17
20:40 It's never as simple as "motherboard was supplying too much power to the SSD"
was that song never gonna give you up
I got Rick rolled noice
Saturated / _big_ thumbnail ✅️  "I sure hope i dont lose my super epic real hardcore world" ✅️ Fake out end of the road moment ✅️  Overly dramatic ✅️  Random metaphors / message unrelated to the content ✅️  Extremely long setup to get to whats advertised ✅️   Looks like we found some more fake content farm slop boys
yo wait chat i remember ur domino videos no shot thats u
Hey wunba, your problem is your not using a supermicro motherboard, tell me your cpu model and I can find you a good motherboard
was i the only one who knew he was gonna rickroll us?
10:13 you sneaky rickrolling snake!
Just a legendary day when Wumba comes out with a new video
how dare you rick role us
i wish this was a bit less fake. you obviously tested each step, but acted as if you didn't.
8:39
Steve must be buff
Blockenheimer
0:59 what mod is that
Casually rickrolling us
I've been secretly Rick-Rolled 💀
Let's not forget about that poor dolphin.
I once had over 2million tent in hardcore
No, the problem is they lag
The new auto crafter that's coming in 1.21 would have definitely helped with craft all of that tnt
Pov u came from that Tik tok video
I'm speechless, and I haven't touched Minecraft in years. Wow
The nuke was so powerful it blew up his computer twice and not even been finnished
This is cool but dude touch some grass
I knew it was going to be never gonna give you up
44:07 Bro rickrolled us💀
I beg you, set up full system backups. Or at least your hardcore world. You won't have to worry about losing tons of data anymore.
bro called an ssd a storage card 💀
insane
you have great patience
this is the most epic video I've ever seen
Mad respect for the dedication dude!! Keep up the cool vids man!! Some people just see a video of a guy playing a video game but some people just get it. I really dig it, man.
you just beat a word recored
Hi
I suggest you that you should store your world in a online storage regularly
18:21 Why did he sound like Bonnie from FNAF?
WUNBA! Why. you over priced the poster. its 20 dollars . im broke And i want one, so please make it free for me
10:03 underscores (locals) girls like us intro but in Minecraft
we got Openheimer in Minecraft before GTA VI 💀
You lied it was not 13 seconds that was 12.98 seconds
i watched a forty minute video to get rickrolled💀💀💀💀 wunba is an absolute legend
Omg this was so entertaining 😂❤
you're crazy
You deserve my like and subscribe
hm
F for the old editor
naw id win
Oppenheimer's been real quiet since this dropped
"I am become death, the destroyer of cubes"
hated the rickroll loved the big as h**l blast
bro took the word ([ E P I C ]) to another level
Try to do this challenge I have no flipping Mall do you Hackle you know you're doing this challenge that is just no mods on you or call mode reset your hardcore metal reset or just do another hardcore mode from the beginning and do it legit not no hacks or glitches or articles do it legit no goddamn okay okay
nah bro we got rick rolled
Wow        👌
I love this but what happened to the world?
im subscribed that was amazing💯💣💥💥💥
make a video with sb737 plss ask him at least
Very anticlimactic like 46mins for a small glimpse of the aftermath very sad. Like what a waste of time that other people sat through all that time just to see nothing.
44:07 that was cool
So did you survive?
10:10 did he just say never gonna give you up
me know its a rickroll
Video starts @ 45:17  Jesus I've never seen so much nothing in one video :/
Good job Rick rolling us pt 2
Bro 13467 cup is wild
-Create superflat world -Set ground to be made out of tnt -Lit one block  Watch the fun begin
Each sub I get from this comment I’ll reply on my own comment
8:30 What? 💀 Thats not how it works
Yk you're a Minecraft youtuber when you have to blur your feet😭
There was a much easier way to do this ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUT THE ALL ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUT THE SUGAR BOXES INSIDE OF THE SOCCER BOXES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!¡!!!!¡!!!!!¡!!¡!¡!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bro rickrolled up
hgdfsgh
So, let's see of the aftermath view...
na brobably only the pc
This ain’t the biggest explosion ever I’m pretty sure it was me on my moms phone
did u die
When he said ludicrous I remembered the state farm ad when ludicrous said "alrightwho called for ludicrous"
Womp womp
great video, however, a scientifically accurate nuke this large would release radioactive elements all around the world killing every single living organism and effectively destroying the world
What Mobo did you have that was frying your SSD? I'd like to avoid it.
Good job Rick rolling us.
this is crazy
arson
Hi
I love how you can hear Jortstorm in the background.
WUNBA Y U RICK ROLL
"mathematically accurate" ...
Least insane minecraft project:
BRO I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO BREW A POTION WTF 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
What
Dude, that's insane. Nobody has made a nuke so realistic that it orders pizza. I love pizza, I'll head to japan soon.
Y u rock rol
THIS STUFF WAS BETTER THAN A MOVIE BY CHRISTIAN NOLAN
did he just rick roll us?😂
now, we are all sons of bitches
I love your video's
i just got rick rolled at the end💀
I KNEW HE WAS GONNA RICKROLL US WITH THE MUSIC OML.
No please don't  delete
never gonna give you up
You set the record on my birthday
bro rick rolled us twice
he is being held captive someone call 911
NOT THE RICK ROLL ANYTHING BUT THE RICK ROLL😢
This all just makes me think how far minecraft has come from watching The Creatures back in the day and everything begging Notch to fix the ladders. Insane to think about and i feel mad old.   Dope video man, insane effort!
He really rick rolled us in the middle of his world record
Bro become Oppenheimer.
Always back up your data!!! Especially after you almost lost everything the first time. You should've immediately backed up your data when you got it back... But this was a great video and im glad it worked out, this is the first video of yours I've watched and i subbed. So im glad you didn't delete the channel 😁👍.
Why not use auocrafters instead of the mod?
10:05 nice rickroll
All of the sudden I wanna play Minecraft again.
bro really rickrolled us in minecraft💀
Bro was watching too much Oppenheimer 💀
rest in peace, money, pc storage and important things in the old storage
damn the world ended up looking like 2b2t
thats why we take advantage of cloud storage
Man, the dedication and creativeness you put in there is beyond what most can think of. Hats off 🎩
What a waste of 40 mins.
wow wunba
This was a very big explosion along with the very entertaining video like always keep it up wunba
i love interstellar too it my fav movie. esp the music
Thats not world record, i did better 10 years ago
bruv this video is insane
ASMR
9:45 This is too funny 🤣
This deserves way more likes than 80k
He has become death the destroyer of worlds
That was the most amazing, nerve racking, and dramatic thing I have ever seen. I wouldn't be caught dead putting in so much work. I commend you.
1 to 1 a mrbeast video. And it works
Bro just rickrolled his entire community in one video 💀
me gonna pass the bet by downloading the world and getting 1 more extra
I once filled an entire cave system with TNT and blew it up. Every nook, every cranny, every single space of air was filled with tnt. Here on My old gaming account https://youtu.be/UEemSXEk-Zw?si=kqNuMURrH02beHBx
Why do you sound like ai
I will do 15 pushups for every like this gets and upload a video of me doing it on my channel
you just got 119.000 subs just in 7 days 🎉🎉
0:40 Jason doesnt know that he just made a suicide bomb in a cube game. F Jason.
Now make a build using the crater , like a lake with an island in the center
This was phenomenal. The cinematography alone was breathtaking
36:18  the start
Dareonic 5:13
Ur like bionic but dareonic
If you think this was all made in hardcore you're special kind of naive.
Damn, that's some real dedication.
Nice Rick Roll XD
Yooo
Am I the only one that just noticed totems blink at you 😂 8:14
i just realized that the the music stage was playing 'never gonna give you up'
Wasted 40 min of my life for no boom
10:04 …… he rickrolled us.
Why dolphin dies when out of a water?
10:03 😂😂 when he says the list he rickrolled us
Wunba why dont you make video about collecting every varient armor with the trim on it and collab with rekrap i would love to that video
People who are awesome and watched the video all the way through without skipping 😎👇🏻
what? the MB supplyed too much power???? could you tell us the model of the malfunctioning motherboard ?
poor delivery guy just got ignored after the thank you
hey i saw ur cube collection im a cuber too😊
Soo, did you survive?
10:00 bro is rickrolling us 44:10 TWICE
Bro litterly recited Oppenheimer
You are so determined
i forgot what video i was gonna watch next of wumba there is to much to choose from
10:06 I just wanna know why dude.
Yes it's a nukes worth of tnt. No it's not a world record. You can say it is to feel better though. Like the video other then the false presentation
Did he die???
bro just rickrolled us
I have autohotkey and the mouse doesn't move, it just flashes over.  Not saying the whole video is fake, but tha part is.
Castcrafter was mentioned! Sogar ein Deutscher hat es in das Video geschafft, wow
I will Bust 1 Nut every like this comment gets
R.I.P the chicken in the minecart 💀
Omg that was sogood also btw I love how you rickrolled us lol
I love how he blurs his feet
10:02 bro just rock rolled us💀
14:19 flying? Createv mode
Bruh! A rick roll 44:05
I still cant belive it
But did he survive the blast?? I hope he did 😭
Yo. Will see?
What is the height and length please tell me 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Imagine if he died right before the tnt explosion 😂😂
Me on 44:12 was this all just a rickroll?
this is masterpiece omg the buildend in the last few minutes :O
wait, did you live?
He really rickrolled us. Bru
there's not only one bomb. theres also his computer
Hoppers honey blocks hoppers hoppers hoppers.
This guy is only allowed to ever just own ONE SSD at a time. Backups do not exist in his world. CTRL + C is disallowed. This guy is playing real life on hardcore difficulty.  or he's just a massive restart.
wunba u put in so much work to make us happy tysm
Wow
13:03
Bro you are so creative. I cannot even imagine doing this much work just for a 30 - 40 min video i mean imagine working 1-2 months and spend real money that is actually so much (311 dollars) just for a video! Im so motivated and inspirated by you.
WUMBA U ARE A NOT A GOD PLAYER BC I SAW A ZOMBIE U CHEATED MAKE A REAL ONE 🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕🖕 IN THIS PART 38:28
I literally guessed the music was never gonna give you up
Bro how about the pizza
Do you think the chicken survived at the end?
Test
Hey yo i just o server why is it your totem blinks...😮
how do you do the blueprints?
31:37
wait... how did you salvage the footage if your SSD was fried?
if Wunba dont upload in 5 months, you know what happend
10:11 did i just get Rickrolled?
you never showed the part where you survived
well done bro
It isn’t a Wunba video without his world gets deleted or he dies
Just another click beit.
one of the best vids i have ever seen
Bro was placing 66 blocks per second, while placing millions of blocks total, and wonders why his PC was cooked, lmao
R.I.P Dave the chicken he died to make us happy and explode that tnt
That's cool, but we don't actually see the explosion destroying the world, just good looking scene of flying tnt and the after math...
Bro really Rick rolled us he thought we won’t notice because he spaced out each word
Lava legit just revived the entire channel, hardcore series and bros life. Give some respect to him
Rickroll 10:08
Hoppers and hoppers and hoppers and hoppers and hoppers and red stone and hoppers and sand and hoppers
I did the math 1300000 TNT would be 2.028 Megatons of TNT. It would be around the same blast strength as the R-12 (The nuke from the Cuban Missle crisis) but in no way close to the strongest nuke the Tsar Bomba. (This is only with 1300000 TNT.)
Fake vid. So obvious.
DUDE WHAT IS THIS VIDEO WHO IS JASON XDDD YOU HAVE MY LIKE AND MY SUB !!!
i know smth that you dont know, you can build bacons to whit iron blocks:]
Just 7 days you got 2.1M views and 84K Likes wow 🤯
I was in the sand live stream and I was doing 5 push-ups every subscriber and I ended up doing more then 30 push- ups
he had to make it that song lol. ive been subbed for 2 years now so congrats on 1m subs
Hahahahahahaha toilet paper
bro just rickroller  with note block like wtf how
(\_/) (●_●) />❤
10:02 did we get rickrolled?
Look please do understand that art is an explosion!!!!
4:25 sooo how did you manage to lose 2000 level?
the good thing about these giant-ass projects is that you can catch up on shows and movies that you like watching  bad thing is that you'll get burnt out eventually.
Normal
NUCLEAR BOMB?!!!!?!???! ☢️C:>
As soon as he said the music box was a surprise, i knew he was going to rickroll us for the second time
did this end up requiring any hoppers?
Ohhhh good
How about next time you build a Tournament of Power arena (from dragonball super) in the middle of The End's void.
OH MY GOD!!!!😮
What?!
Me Okay
Hey Wenzo?
Hey Lockdownlife?
Hey Tazoh?
0:45 JASON
Damm I got ASMR rickrolled😂
Wow the music is sweet
that rickroll song is older than 99% of your viewers
That was nobody but God reminding you to still do what you love to do. Great video ☺️
This is one of the most insane things I've ever seen in my life
Bro didn’t have to do the chicken like that💀
45:30 love how there's a pig just watching the devastation
this is one of the best minecraft videos i have ever watched
Blockenheimer Edit: No way, I made this comment looong before the Oppenheimer quote
them
Your pc fried because you let it on for days and you did it for years
Castle Bravo to this!
isn't the fat man bomb = to ~63 tnt blocks, because each block is 1sq meter of dynamite (1327692307.6923077 newtons) / 83 680 000 000.00 (20 tons of dynamite) = 63.02665122 that means that 1 fatman nuke is = to ~63 Minecraft tnt blocks. cool video tho
This guy would make a great hypixel skyblock player 😂
Dominoes are pretty cool
Just remember that chicken the got hatched and stepped in the pressure plate is anti-Christ...
Your motivation is an inspiration to all of us, love the videos keep up the awesome work.
10:09 i just got Rick rolled
Did you get the cursed lagged out white block of TNT that happens after enough of it has blown up.
i didnt knwo minecraft needed math too 💀
I want to understand what happened with your motherboard some more.  Some caps went bad and the board was no longer properly regulating power around your NVME drive?
Was that music never gonna give you up by Rick Astley
great video. I thought i was safe from getting rickrolled but clever way of doing it.
he am become death, destroyer of worlds
I will do one burpee for every comment this like gets
That was a hell of a ride
Me who had to deal with the warden before the dragon in my deep dark only world
you have done soo much for your subscribers it's wild!! (and that's a lot coming from me 'cause i'm a fox if ya get it)
Sounds to me that you used a SUB-STANDARD PC to begin with...  Maybe next time you THINK before you use a PC made for just basic stuff.  If you REALLY need POWER then use EVERYTHING TOP-TIER... say a RYZEN 9 7950 coupled with a NVIDIA 4900 along with a VERY EXPENSIVE MB by ASUS with say 3 or 4 2TB Samsung 990 Pro NvMe drives all being driven by a TOP END PSU at say 1300 to 1600 Watts. THAT IS HOW YOU MAKE A REAL GAMING PC!!!  (GET OUT THE CHECK BOOK!!!)
You should have done it underground. You say it's more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb but so much of that was just spat out into the air and did nothing but explode harmlessly. Putting it into an enclosed area underground would have been far more dramatic in terms of explosion potential.
Dramatic af with that obsidian box to protect you. I don't know anyone who would legitimately do that
Hey guys this is his 2nd channel where he puts voiceover content.
I was just thinking how much this guy has potential and he is wasting it on a youtube channel.
Wunba... are you a cuber?
bro censored his feet
Pls tell me you have another save we can download
Insanity
He secretly rickrolled us
it took a week for this to reach double his subscribers in veiws
i kinda expected more, but i didnt know what i exepecter
He just actually f*cking rickrolled us TWICE
yo i watched your dominos vids a long time ago like a long long time ago so yea Mabey like 5 or 6 from you  so yea i Reilly like the vids
I felt like I was watching a movie. Bro this deserves a sub for sure.
34:12 very good and well, but what is your plan to survive in real life when your PC explodes?
Wow!
Castttt
I like to imagine the Pizza delivery guy is still out there waiting for you to pick up the pizza
He really hid a rick roll message 10:03 and rick roll music at 44:06 XD
35:20 .  Wow!!!! What a bunker!
44:21 bro thought I did not know what song is gonna play
26:34 .  “Doors 🎉” 😄😄😄😄😄
Someone learned the value of backups...twice...before getting it through your head hopefully!
Why not use water logged leaves and ancient dibree for the safety?
21:37 .  I wow thank God!
I’ll do -1 push ups every like this comment gets
as a serious person that is WORKING please do BACKUPS 😡
guy just wakes up and decides to break a couple of world records and gaming records
i love the never gonna give you up music part
Ryzen threadripper pro
i knew it was gonna be a rickroll
don't buy samsung ssds lol
Hey bro, I didn’t watch this video on this account but I did on my dads and play in bedrock edition and I want to mend my armour, tools, etc but I can’t place them in my offhand. How do you suggest I mend them (preferably afk)
31:44 Peter Griffin joined the video
Hi
Did you survive
Back in ps3 days you cpuld make a superflat world with nothing but tnt and blow it all up. That would be the most tnt.
What happened to the dolphin.
Subscribed
I will do 1 dive every time this comment gets a like
i  love  it
did you survive
Put a photosensitivity warning when you're doing flashing effects like this man 6:50 please!
Did your hard-core world get deleted 😂😅😅😅😂😂❤🎉😢😮😅😊❤😂🎉😢😮😅😊
What an incredible explosion that was O-o very cool!  WAIT DID YOU SURVIVE OR NOT???????
THE CHICKEN AT THE END, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is actually the most insane 1 million subscriber special I’ve ever seen lmao
Glömde säga jävla hora också
never gonna give you up never gonna let you down,you just got rickrolled haha
Fun fact: oppenhiemer and barbie dropped their first products in japan.
Good job i give you all my respect
This man has the audacity to rick roll us twice… respect
I love how he just rick rolled us
Fuck man as a kid who’s dream is to have 1 mill subs and only has 13 seeing all these fucking crazy 1 mill specials is like fuck bro how am I going to do that
21:29 i swear when it changes to the runway bit / chain reaction your balls dropped
You worked so hard on this you deserve for me to like the video and subscribe 😮that was awesome 🤩
I took a second to realize the song u made “never gonna give you up never gonna let u down”
I don't even really watch much Minecraft content these days, but after seeing what you went through with this project, I am subscribing to you out of sheer respect and admiration.
what if when he was testing it accidentally went of!😥
You should use a structure block to copy the whole tnt and chain reaction so u can do it again
🔳🔲🈸➿⭕➰➖⚛🈂🈷🅱🅾🅾🅿🅱🅾🅿ℹ🅱🅾ℹ🅿🈚🆙Ⓜ▪▫
The rick roll was crazy💀
Spoilers, there was a big explosion.
I will do -1 steps every like this comment gets
Hopefully Wunba doesn’t have anything against Japan
A lot of the people in the comments here have 0 chill over that repair tech. Lighten up a bit, you'll be a lot less miserable. Tuber shoulda been backing up his data on the regular anyways.
Underrated youtuber,congrats for 1m subs❤
that rickroll made my day
Super anticlimactic and why did the editer make it super saturated?
RIP to that one chicken.
did the chicken in the minecart survived?
19:12 You were so lucky that first time the hard drive broke. Most of the time it is either impossible or increadibly expensive to recover lost data from corrupted drives.  ALWAYS make backups! Even when the motherboard doesn't kill it, an SSD can only be written to and read from a limited number of times. Eventually (usually after many years but still) it WILL break.
fun fact: i got a dominoes ad right after the dominoes worker tipped the domino lmao, how perfect
I Subbed right as all the tnt went off :D
Rickroll warning
I bless you with luck my friend You will hit million followers this year
44:05
WunbaYT…
I don't even play or watch Minecraft, but you just got a new subscriber. I love the awesome time lapses and engineering.
It took me so long to see the result of the destruction, and when your game arrives at night, and it doesn't even show the hole, I know it was a lot of work, but I didn't like it, I just wanted to see the damage. 👎🏻
I make sure to listen to the sounds...
WHAT AUTO KLICKER IS THAT?!
This was crazy
So eh... did you survive in the obsidian cube or what???
I'm getting a bone saying that wunba rick rolled
I can't believe you had to become a techy guy like me to make this video
2:44
Achievement Get: Minecraft Rickroll
A conduit is a heart of the seas shell 🤯
That was so disappointing
NAH WHEN THE PIZZA DELIVERY GUY TOPPLED THE DOMINOS, I GOT AN AD FOR DOMINOS
Who else noticed the rick roll
45:12 for the "explosion"
Bro very good work on the video. The editing and the speaking are so catchy
All the good youtubers have a bad upload schedule
bro is trying to hard to be Mr. beast
yall not gonna talk about how he rickrolled us?
i love the way your music fits into your building and breaking
No chicken was harmed during the filming of this explosion testing.
Nuke Goldberg machine
Your venture is similar to the hobby of Hi Power Rocketry, hundreds of dollars, months or more of work, 5 seconds of fire and fury followed at some point by a chute..
WOW
Are you sure about that
"but right now they aren't that interesting, which is why *drum roll* i added doors *confetti*"
secret message is you up
he rick rolled all of us💀
What if he didn’t put “in Minecraft” in the title
You took 45 minutes to build up this huge momentous thing and the giant tnt block went from there to not there you didn't actually show us anything
If you watched this video you got rickrolled
Why do you sound like @skipthetutorial
Bbbb
honestly, i think that it is the power suply
41:07 how are ther 2 of you?
That song was from another youtuber called allen becker
Bro rick roled me
You deserve millions of subscribers!
storage card is wild
this is just poetic
wunba give back kingsammelots play button >:(
bruh, struggling to do something for 5 hours, i once spent 8 hours mining away the end dimmension on a public server because i was bored
what mod are you using for how much block you need ı want it pls
that was a ride
I love how even after your first storage drive got corrupted, you still didn't make a backup of the world. Fucking baffling. Not trying to be mean, but dude, you had two drive failures in a week and still didn't learn to make regular backups. Hell, you can install a mod that makes an auto backup at regular intervals without any input. Default is once an hour. Would have saved a lot of headache and wasting time redoing the work.
at 10:03 he was saying a Lot of items but in the text som words was oreange and it spells out somthing
superß
2 RICKROLLS IN ONE VID HOW DARE YOU BETRAY ME LIKE THAT
This isn’t actually the largest  if you play on the Xbox 360 you can make a superflat out of TNT and that is the biggest explosion you can get
31:21 why bro screaming in lower case
best rick roll ever
Did you survive?!?
Damn. What a great video. So much effort on it.
Um……………..
Not the world record.
Did I seriously get rickrolled
On my way!
Is the best video i have ever seen about minecraft👌
Nah I refuse to believe Wunba has only 1.18M subscribers... Come on guys he deserves 100x more than this
Do you have a voice changer
Video: 99% Explosion: 1%

Did he die
We got Rick rolled 😅
The Rickroll
I wish I knew why this game simply refuses to play well on my PC...  Before anyone replies with a SMART ASS comment, my PC's got a 3080TI, an i7-8086k and 32GB or ram... And this game runs like absolute DOG SHIT. Half the time it simply crashes minutes after starting.
Should always save anything important to the cloud and load from the cloud.
@
Keep up the good work man you are crushing it
why did you rickroll me
2:56 You, like many, misunderstood the phrase "I am become death". It does not mean "I have become death", but "I am the manifested death", the "death that has become reality".
this is some mrbeast type shit
Now do it with tnt minecarts
44:07 another Rick roll lol
44:06 he really let us wait almost 45 minutes to get rick rolled
The chicken in the minecart: i become death, the destroyer of worlds
The editing... Man it must has been so loooong ! Great vidéo !!
😢 nuc "u" lar ..bruh it's nuclear dummy the s is silent
45:31 look at the pig 😂
cringe video
huge minecraft W
Holy moly man! This is insane!! Best Minecraft YouTube video I’ve ever seen! I am in awe, I recommend u 2 a friend of mine and I liked and subbed, congrats on the world record!
if your ssd fried up again buy a hard drive and put your data in so you didnt lost evrything
bro please return the pc you stole to NASA
10:12 Bro rickrolled us 😂
This is the most insane Minecraft hardcore video I have ever seen, the editing, animations are perfect.
Did he die??(his Minecraft character)
You are a disappointment, it was 311 AND 25 cents

44:19 bro really rickrolled us
...                                didnt expect that rickroll while you collecting stuff
Probably the best Minecraft related video ever

BOOM BOOM BOIS!!!!!!!
The song is like rick roll💀
Did anybody see the totem of undying blink?
He is not a Minecraft player He is a freaking Minecraft scientist
If someone told me Wunba removed all existing blocks in his hardcore world, I wouldn't be surprised..  Wunba is a chad
45:32 someone help the poor pig its begging for mercy
Best vid ever
Yeah SSD dying two times sounds like motherboard issue... Though, that the system POSTs in safe mode indicates that it's not just a dead SSD... So probably would have been worth investigating further than just swapping out an SSD... Also, the system seems to still have detected the drive (M.2_1, provided that is your system drive, and not a secondary one.) Also, it's complaining about that AMD GPU driver thing, which should be unrelated to the SSD.  In addition to that, you're RAM is still running without XMP at 2666, you are giving up performance man.  And finally, I gotta say, kind of your fault. We IT guys love saying:  No backup, no pity. Hope you learned from this, and back up your stuff now.
You rick rolled us
and 10h but afk 1day ahhahahahahahha
broo killed so many whither and has like 90 becon
44:09 did the totem just blink⁉️
In the bustling heart of the metropolis, where the cacophonous symphony of car horns, chatter of pedestrians, and the distant howls of sirens blended into a chaotic crescendo that seemed to echo through the very arteries of the city, amidst the towering monoliths of steel and glass that stretched skyward like the fingers of giants reaching for the heavens, casting long shadows that danced across the maze of streets and alleyways below, there existed a vast and intricate tapestry of human existence, woven from the delicate strands of fate and circumstance, where the dreams of the ambitious collided with the harsh realities of daily life, and the hopes of the hopeful were buffeted by the relentless winds of change, in a tumultuous whirlwind of triumphs and tribulations, joys and sorrows, love and loss, that unfolded with all the drama and intensity of a Shakespearean epic, where every corner held the promise of adventure and every hidden crevice concealed a treasure waiting to be discovered, where laughter reverberated like the pealing of church bells on a crisp autumn morning and tears flowed freely in the quiet solitude of the night, where hope shimmered like a mirage in the desert, flickering faintly in the darkness yet refusing to be extinguished, even in the face of overwhelming adversity, for in this sprawling jungle of concrete and steel, amidst the hustle and bustle of urban life, there burned a flame of hope, a beacon of light that pierced through the gloom, guiding lost souls towards a brighter tomorrow, where the promise of redemption and renewal beckoned on the distant horizon, like a shimmering oasis in the desert of despair, offering solace to the weary traveler and sanctuary to the restless soul, in a world where the only limit was the boundlessness of the human imagination.
44:15 I knew it
IS THAT RICK ROLL
cast crafter is a german youtuber
omg, my browser tab shut down while you were talking about your PC crash... and I was so confused what's going on xD and this never happened before, so this timing was insane!

This man definitely deserves the best all for his hard work. Wishing you the best man. U just gained another subscriber❤
if I do this I will die😅😢
so cool 😂🎉😮
okay, but now do it in Minecraft infdev-… god that would take forever, might do it myself actually, that being said, congrats on the world record!
This vidio made me subscribe
what an absolute joy to watch. i've never seen your videos until now, and i love pushing the limits of things. i cant wait for more!
I fucking respect you. The BUILDING would take forever, but you did this in SURVIVAL.
What would you like to play as your final song before your hard-core world ends?  Him: 😏
I found a website on the internet, and well, a real 2.4 megaton nuke would have a fireball 2km in radius and do heavy damage within nearly 3km radius. Which makes the minecraft result really really really tame by comparison. I guess if you used commands to detonate all tnt blocks at the same time it might do a slightly more realistic amount of damage.
I live in south Africa can you visit the place 🙏🙏😇🥺😔
That is one of the most peaceful song lyrics ❤️😍 I🥰😶
Black is not a colour
I’m new here and I wanted to say I let the ads fully play to do whatever I can to support this insane video like what did us viewers do to deserve such an extreme high effort and high quality video ;-; like holy shit
cant even be mad abt that rick roll, lmao
10:03 this guy started rickroll us
I loved how he broke a world record possibly dying jn his hardcore world and rick rolls us mid way
Am I the only one who saw the rickroll

Great work Wunba ❤  994 19 Wunba   Show more replies   @maral2014 4 days ago 13:40. It is a common misconception that a minecraft tnt block contains 1,650 kg of tnt.  A minecraft tnt block only contains 412.5 kilograms of tnt, assuming trinitrotoluene is the explosive material.   Let me explain:  In minecraft, a block of tnt is 16 pixels in all 3 dimensions, X, Y, and Z.  If we look at the top of the tnt block, we can see 16 individual tubes filled with explosives, they grey material. The red material is simply the packaging.  There are 100 centimetres in a metre. 1 minecraft block is 1 cubic metre. Each tube of actual explosives is only 2 pixels wide.   100 / 16 = 6.25cm.  1 pixel is 6.25 cm wide.  Finding the top surface area for one explosive tube:  2 x 6.25 = 12.5 12.5^2 = 156.25 cm^2.  Now, lets find the volume of one explosive tube, assuming they run the full height of the block, which is one metre:  100 x 156.25 = 15,625 cm^3.  Now, we get the volume for all 16 tubes.  16 x 15,625 = 250,000 cm^3  Now that we have the volume for all of the tubes, we can calculate the ACTUAL mass of all of the TNT in one minecraft block.   the density of TNT is 1.65 g/cm^3 1.65 x 250,000 = 412,500 grams of tnt. 412,500 / 1000 = 412.5 kilograms of tnt.  Now, what was the actual yield of all of the tnt in the video?  In the video, he states that the yield is 2,421 KT of tnt. We now know this to be false.  There are 1,372,032 blocks of tnt. We multiply this by the mass of tnt in one block, in tonnes.   1,372,032 x 0.4125 = 565,963.2 tonnes. 565,963.2 tonnes = 565.9632 kilotonnes  All of the tnt in the pile is actually only about 566 kilotonnes.   For context, the largest pure fission weapon tested by the USA was Ivy King, which had a yield of 500KT, 66 KT less powerful than the tnt pile created in this video. The largest nuclear bomb, the Tsar Bomb (which was thermonuclear), had a yield of 50 Megatonnes, aka 50,000 KT.   For anyone who got this far, sorry if I gave you a headache
his todom was bicking
Hi
İ will saying Vunba is best this comment get's like
should of just waited for the crafter to do the crafting part
Got Rick rolled
I will do 10 push ups 4 everyone that likes his channel

You should make the nether but underwater.
I have no Words😅😅😅
Woooooooooooooooooow
Baller😵😵
5:55 bro became openhimer💀💀💀💀💀
thank you for doing all that for a single but amazing explosion
Huh? The PC was just fine. You showed different screenshots with different footages, from different computers. None of the "pc frying" really happened. Or if it did... then maybe don't show fake screenshots.
bro wasted his time and money and his pc just for his videos and actually did u die when it explode????
Do you guys think this guy was watching too much Oppenheimer that day?
blockenheimer
we need a mod where tnt blast waves combine and not just overlap, would prob make tnt explosions more laggy but would make them more realistic/more powerful lol
this guy must be the most useless member of society EVER. so much time lost that could have been put into more useful stuff. this is depressing.
Why the rickroll. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
44:12 me:wait a minute
Wow
R.I.P Minecart Chicken. Gone but not forgotten...
i have the sudden urge to play minecraft again
12:50 what is happening with his levels?
When I think of high effort youtubers this guy has to be the top
Bro started Hiroshima in Minecraft
the music was so good at the end
For all the effort you went through to get us this video you deserve the like and subscribe

Looking at a Minecraft block we see that it is composed of 16 sticks of TNT. Assuming that each stick produces 2.1 MJ of energy, we can deduce that a block of TNT produces 33.6 MJ of energy. So to get the same yield as the Little Boy Atomic bomb which produced a yield of 63 TJ you would have to place a total of 1,875,000 Block of TNT. 🧨🤯💥
If we're gonna go out, We're going out in style
Oppenminer
But did you die?     This is a meme LOL
I have no idea who you are or why you're in my recommendations, but my god, that's impressive. Congrats.
Bro almost at 2 mil alr
RIP for the chicken at the end who died just for the tnt
I won't breathe until wunba replies or hearts
You should have backed up the world to explode it multiple times
I'm not a sub. But you definitely earned my Like and Sub with this video. Pretty sweet man. Great job.
Did you seriously rick roll us in a montage XD
It's not a world record
You lost your hardcore world
I started playing Minecraft when wolves were introduced. I stopped around the time Microsoft took over as other things were taking my attention (my daughter had turned 5). I dipped in and out but the complexity was quite frankly overwhelming. But my daughter started taking an interest and I sadly never got the “itch” needed it to scratch. She is a lover of the game and your channel and this video has started that itch again. Subbed, liked and the surprise signed poster she will be soon getting will be the start of a new Minecraft daddy daughter era. Thanks for showing the power Minecraft has on imagination.
did you survive
whisper "never gonna give you up"
Underrated ❤
whats the mod you use for the blueprints
I believe this is the largest tnt explosion by hand,  but when i shut down my minecraft server after 5 years of operations, I nuked the entire spawn world by spawning a giant sphere of tnt so big that it crashed the server. i had 200+ players. i had to turn off worldguard XD my staff didnt know what was going on either, it was perfect
22 minutes ago, 5237 comments, wow, peak video actually
what auto clicker do you use?

the amount of effort this man puts in to his videos is crazy so subscribe

10:04 are we just gonna ignore the fact that he literally just rickrolled us??
You were gonna delete your entire YouTube channel just because your drive broke and you lost 1 Minecraft world? ... what a freaking noob.
I’m so glad my subscription was actually good for something.

LUV YOUR VIDS hope to see more EXACTLY LIKE THIS 😂 Tysm!! Have a good day!!!❤❤❤
How did I guess what song he was going to play with those note blocks. XDDDD
I can hear jort storm in the background
On the timeframe 29:52 with the chicken eggs you put 64 not 16 in each stack
33:09 I know your gonna rickroll me  Edit: I was correct
not the world record
this premiered on my bday
I just subscribed :l
10:03 bro really thought we will not notice the rickroll(each orange word in the subtitles)
Wait the totem blinks like the player!?!?!
Im not gonna lie 2 months of waiting for this is a bit disappointing, we couldnt even see the tnt blow up properly or anything. Cool idea, jist poorly executed imo
I destroyed ur record, in the old 360 minecraft you can make a whole world in tnt. thus beating the amount of tnt you had.
Besides the epic blast, bro rick rolled us.
Yo that explosion was like 8000000
never gana give you up

For some reason I’m in the mood for maths. 1.3 million cubic meters of trinitrotoluene, each of which weighs approximately 1650kg. 1.3 million times 1650 = 2145000000 (2.145 billion kg or 2.145 megatons)   The nuclear weapons used at the end of WW2 - The Little Boy and the Fat Man - each had an approximated payload equivalent to 20000 tonnes or 15000 tonnes respectively, so the nuclear yield of the TNT cube is equivalent to 107.25 Fat Men, or 143 little boys  To compare to a modern nuclear weapon, however: The most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated is the Tsar Bomba, coming in at approximately 50 megatons, making it equivalent to 23.31 times the payload of the cube.   Do with that information what you will. (Also, I’m doing this not having watched the video yet, cause I saw the video and felt a mathematical urge. Feel free to point out any stupidity as you will)
Me: i want to see openheimer Mom: we already have openheimer at home Openheimer at home:  Jk love the video
NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP, NEVER GONNA LET YOU DOWN

I dodge the incoming rickroll by skipping past the "up" got outbrained idjit.
Me: wow, found this guy playing maincraft I wonder about more things about him... Wunba: *mentions being scared of paying for medicine* Me: oh, okay, he's american, alright
Am I the only one who notices that Wunba rickrolled us all in like the first ten minutes of the video?
yo just buy a normal 2.5 ssd not a freaking m.2
HOPPERS
That was epic.
Bro ordered a pizza in minecraft (what the heck bro)
Hee is cool bro😂

How did u save ur records for this video ? u said ur ssd is completly melted
Damn son
You are the definition of dertermination and sheer will damn.
nice rickroll, I got it at the second word
10:04 he Rickrolled us
Did you die?
i knew it was gonna be a rickroll you can rickroll me!!!!
Tech nerd here LULULULOL ok well first time it showed the american megatrends screen bc u were placing the blocks so fast so every 40 seconds minecraft was making enormous sized files bc of the many blocks and ur SSD couldn't handle all of them so it just crashed right on your Windows 11 installation so it booted right on the BiOS screen but the damage wasn't rlly bad and the data was recovered but the second time with the second SSD the same happened but at a worse rate and the SSD stopped getting power but the motherboard thought it was good so it took more voltage from the power supply and fried both the SSD and the motherboard (kind of) the motherboard was at its last legs before it died out completely and it was good that u got a new motherboard bc there are smaller chances of it happening again
This man is so dedicated. I appreciate it a lot.
23:45 what is the goddamn music!?
bro just get a nuke mod
wunbaheimer is real!!

YOU DESERVE A SUB AND LIKE BRO
19:50 if the SSD have been sold by a store you should  A) Get refounded  B) Proceede charge for fraud he told it was a SSD issue when it was a motherboard issue, that could be detected quite easly with some memtest so he just scam you 300+ $...  SSD Are made to work for 2 years and it's on the store who sell it to you to repay/repair if there is any issue with it.
Did i really just got rick rolled😐
is no one gonna talk about how he rickrolled us all at 10:03
bro we got rick roll🤣
Bro Rickrolled us
I love your high effort and quality content very much!!!!!!!!!
You need backup and maybe even zfs!
44:10 u should totally make an actual song with that tune, its rlly good
10:14 Did u Rick roll us?
are you cheating in your world
I was expecting the Rick roll
Why is there 2???
Can we talk about how this man rickrolled us in two ways in this video...
yapping
9:42 Man, I sure love when all you need for a redstone contraption is hoppers, hoppers, hoppers, hoppers and hoppers. It makes my life so much easier.
bro really built all this for pizza
is the "someone please send help they are holding me captive and won't let me stop working until I finish the video!" real?
He took that big TNT block from me. He hacked my world and acted like he built it because now I can’t enter my world which means he hacked it, or someone hacked it and that is the exact same thing that I made unsubscribe from this person he’s a hacker he hacks us, I used to be subscribed to him that’s how he knew what my world name was.
did i just got rickrolled by a redstone build???
The hidden rickroll in the video is so dumb 😂
The nuke was not accurate since a nuke blows up aboce the ground... U have to make the bomb again.
Are you eintstain
Imagine being standing right next to it 🪦
16:46 cat shadow
32:26 Bro literally censored his feet instead putting on some dang sockss. Legend.

Can't use the auto crafter ?

Dude ngl this is the MOST effort i have seen any creator put in a single video. Amazing brother.
36:37 yapping stops and interesting stuff starts
Nice rickroll lol that cracked me up
Video extender pro
i wach domino films
where can we get the schematic for the shulker loader?
very good video, too bad you didnt show the pov of aftermath
39:39 bro just secretly rickrolled us
The title is funny
Excellent job on the Rube Goldberg Machine. BTW, what happened to the dolphins?  🤔🤔🤔
Bruh
I predicted the song
Dude, back up your data. There are some great subscription services for online backup.
10:02 bro RickRolled us
That's not mathematically accurate, it's just a fancy redstone contraption that basically activates a tnt which makes all the others explode. The problem with this is that almost 80% of tnts will fly up in the air, pushed by the other tnts, so their power will be wasted in air instead of being an active contribution to the damage. A mathematically accurate tnt would be like a tnt where ALL the tnts explode simultaneously, and this is achieved by making a contraption where the LEAST DELAYED tnt waits and explodes only when the MOST delayed tnt explodes.
22:43 JORT STORM !!!!!!
Did he just Rick rolled us😂😂
bro when he showed us the songbwho no we would get rick rolled
Best vid ever
he rick rolled us
That was great.
I’m not even mad that we got Rick rolled😂
I want to see a tour of the wreck
24:06
To further put the size of this TNT block to scale, Tsar Bomba is roughly 20 times larger at 50,000kt. This thing is closer to the most powerful Nuke ever detonated, than it is to the very first
Bro YOUR PC didn't die rendering this. But my Pc died trying to fucking render the video did
uh i can confirm the greatest tnt blast is loading a world full of tnt on console and see like over 9 billion blocks explode
I dont belive that wunba died and if you think that wunba died to like this comment
He just Rick rolled us by collecting materials 😮‍💨
that one unemployed friend on tuesday:
Mr beast ahh video
did you survived? :v
what are the songs you used for this video?
13:40 "Wait, are we saying there's a chance that when we push that button, we destroy the world?" "Chances are near zero"
That must have rough, your computer melting. Honestly, I can't imagine if that happened on my computer. I'm just glad you could get the world back! You do such amazing work and it would be a shame if that was how it ended.
Many people will not even realize that he secretly rickrolled us
All thar build-up and we barely git to see any of the actual explosion? We didn't get to see any of the devastation of the surroundings. Whether he died or not. No aftermath. Almost nothing. That's terrible! You don't tease us with a world record like this and then take it away just as it's about to happen!👎👎👎
Bro why did you blur out your feet
44:07 nah bro pulled a rick roll in MINECRAFT
Wunba if u see this don't heart it, just comment E
Plow twist Jason didn’t topple the dominos
😮😢
why were there two of him
😮1789m
He should have gave you a refund
?????😮😮
Okay im subscribed damnn
W
He whispered never godnat give you up
Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down. Never gonna run around and explode you.
10:02 what’s that song called again?
Fake. Everyone knows that any PC will blow up IRL upon a rickroll.
10:00-10:18 he Rick rolled us bro
🥹🥹that was the sadesst and hapiest vid ive ever seen🥹🥹
Is he human?
rick roll right? you are evil Wunba @Wunba
Fact so dumb
The American Megatrends screen was bad.
There was no actual nuclear math in this video
that poor chicken who sat in the minecart that set it off...
People please I preach to you out of love belive on the lord jesus christ and trust in him for you salvation and not in yourself christ came to die for our sin we have all sinned and deserve hell but god is so merciful and jesus died on the cross to take our punishment so that who ever belive on him will not perish but have eternal life john 3:16 romans 10:9 if we confess with our mouth jesus is lord and belive in our heart that god rose him from the dead we will be saved we can not earn salvation it is the free gift from god❤❤❤❤.,,.,.,
Loaded spur loaded shulkers In another shulker
16:46 Ludicrous Speed? Sir, we've never gone that fast before. I don't know if the ship can take it.  27:06 Not yet.  44:06 You sly motherfu-  45:25 "I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that one way or another."
i guessed that it would that music
you freaking got me! damn rick rolled!
Saving you 40 minutes of your life 40:32
pls backup ur files next time
how is bro gonna pay his rent now?
Can you tell me what the hell you are doing that for nothing
Wunba is insane
The orange text of him saying the Rick roll at 10:04 was foreshadowing the song at the end.Or he was just memeing
What was the old village name?
I think the second note block part was a rickroll.
Worlds most excessive rick roll
The sound like a rick roll 44:07
This is the most amount of effort I have ever seen on a video... I wish you success
Never gonna give you up!
35:25 he build a fricking bunker but almost drowned 😂

I can't believe I just got rickrolled
bro rickrolled us
this was actually so cool to see
lol in real life minecraft is bigger than earth in several ways. your math was significant to the creators of an algorithmic artificial world with only one limit. that is your computer. this is nothing new and please.. make it worth your time. this was interesting but really boring for what stage minecraft is in and has to offer. tnt is weak sauce buddy, dont waste your time unless you have something new. just trying to be real with you.
$1+♾
i love this guy
is that a rickroll at 44:15
*your PC explodes like the nuke*
Me when I see a explosion : evacuate evacuate the Chernobyl bomb test went wrong and hit the biggest nuclear power plant and exploded and caused radiation

WHY WAS IT 5 DAYS AGO?!
wunba j. blockenheimer
the totem blinks
The Rick roll 😜
If this was done in creative or survival mode you could easily use console commands to spawn the TNT but I don’t think you can use console commands in hardcore mode at all so it will be long and hard as long as your game doesn’t crash in the process.
that poor chicken got nuked
44:07 rickroll
"weeeelll you see'🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓"the tsar bomb was 50 mega tons" 🤓🤓🤓🤓 "and your is only 1 mega ton"🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓

sat
Wunba how did you get so big on YouTube. I'm starting a Minecraft gaming channel but I'm not getting that many views. so, all I'm asking is can you give me some tips on how to be a big Minecraft creator.
Damn he hated the chicken

why the hell did you rick roll us (edit: twice. you did it twice. i replied in the middle of the video and i will not accept being rickrolled twice)
i'm not watching 49 minutes of video just to see some tnt explode
He rick rolled us 😂😂😂😂
Did you live
Tech Guy here. I would very much suggest you to get a proper workstation for these kinds of things. Also do a RAID setup with NVMe's to have no more issues in the case another SSD dies. If you want more help with this feel free to comment under this. I can also help you pick out a workstation since i work at a Company that provides solutions for this high performance computing(not traditional HPC i know but this is already far from average Consumer work)
you should do this for your ten million sub special, with TEN MILLION TNT!!
You made such a great video! You should give your team a tip; the animations and edits were SOLID
ALL YOUR FILES AAAAAAAAAAH
This is crazy bro, you're a genius, love the persistance!
your editor do be good
Finally, a good minecraft youtuber that doesn't swear!
Solid video
that rickroll was smooth
45:30 For those who don't have the time for all his bullshit. 45 mins for this underwhelming shit?
ngl i expected that rickroll lol
😮
well I guess that your pc did break but for all of the wrong reasons
THAT.WAS.EPIC!
Your voice ruins the entire chain reaction I’m disliking this video 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
I hope you have learned the most important lession wheb working with computers:  1. Backup 2. Backup 3. Backup  3b. A backup in the same machine is not a backup
Can we just appreciate that he spent over $300 on this one video
We got rickrolled in Minecraft if u didn’t know what the Minecraft music was we got rickrolled so hard
lol me sub in 3... 2...1...
SUPERB
pov skeleton with flame bow
thank you so much for this. I love all the different parts to this video.
It kind of sounds like kreek craft
Never gonna give you up never gonna let you down

#Carstcrafter 34:00
31:34 ayo
surprised his pc didnt create a 7000km blast radius
hate to say but after 45 minutes of build up, i was kinda underwhelmed.
Blud foreshadowed the song heade from the very beginning 😂😂
Good job man 👍👏
@Castcrafter  haha
officially, at this moment, 11:31 p.m. Spanish time, there are as many views as tnt on this video
24:40 I've seen those videos before, they were really cool just like this channel's vids
This is why U haven't uploaded for alot💀
HE WAS SAYING NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP IN THE YELLOW LOL
The whole ssd card literally almost made me cry
Insane
bro that was so epic, and you spend so much time working on this, epic job
That was huge!!!!! Unfortunately that wouldn't be more powerful than the biggest bomb in history, or the Tsar bombs.  It yielded 50,000 kilotons, or 1,570 times than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined!  But what amazes me the most is how you did this!
10:20 not going to lie, that was the best part of the video. in a good way
I knew what the song was, gonna be, as soon as I saw that he was gonna do some music
not going to lie, I thought there were only 2 strongholds in minecraft worlds... I have now looked it up and realised there are 64 times how many I thought
The totem is blinking
bro why u whispering😂
You earned a subscriber halfway through this showcasing the peak of redstone technology, and it is only fitting that your capabilities are literally nuclear
At about 20 minutes in when you saved your files and world, I could help but yell: WOOOOOOOOOO
The fact that he used Slimesicle's Jort Storm song is absolutely PERFECT
I hate how people who work so hard for things that are so impossible to do and they still complete it and yet no one cares I don’t get that why do people love easy stuff to do and people who do things that are literally impossible but they still do it yet no one cares I don’t get it🤔🤔
Is it just me or are you building something to blow up planets like the death star
i'm never complaining about gathering materials ever again
fucken inspirational
How many Domino's did it take to do the pizza part😂
13:51 so trippy
world record of tnt exploded in minecraft huh? for that u gotta build something ~10x bigger than that tiny new year firecracker
I noticed that secret little Rick Roll you smooth criminal
He said never gonna give you up😂
This is sad😭😭😭
I love this!
Absolute legend for spending the time to film and make this.
Shout out to that guy that just wanted to have the world download. Saved the series 🎊
He was like Bro I lost everything important to me I guess I’ll just play Minecraft instead
The editing is phenomenal, just as the rest of the video! Congrats on 1mil, the video and I wish you the best for the future
the effort this man took pay respect
16:27 so you placed hours?
I'm glad you were able to make your dream come true. Congratulations on 1 million subs and creating a wealth of content for many to enjoy. You should be proud of what you've built.
i would love to see the crater on a large map
i am calling it the music gonna be rickroll
Bro, take congratulations from Belarus!
Mr. Tourge approves of this video
I will do a half push up for every like this comment gets
this vidios amazing and so deep
if you havent alredy send that SSD to a data recovery service they might be able to get it back for you granted you may have gotten the world back but   you said there was other files on it   so yea if you need them  a driver recovery service might be able to help
Every like I get is the amount of gym hours this week
I will do -1 push-ups for every like this comment gets
New editor is dope
He really rickrolled me..
This one never gonna give up😂
Das castcrafter erwähmt wurde kam so überraschend
hoppers
Bro became Oppenheimer on Mincecraft
The pc is gonna blow up bigger than the TNT
Wunba rickrolled us without us even realising
This guys deserves 100m for his efforts. 9:44 10:03 10:21 11:41 12:19 13:29 16:47
using a mod to do that is kinda cheating
how does this guy just find the enderportals
people are divided in two groups: 1. people who doing backups 2. people who will be doing backups
I will beat 2 withers every like this comment gets
Im going 1puchs ups every like 😅😅😅😅
Him: Today we’re going to place a dirt block! Also him: But first, let’s build a beacon.
Nahh you Rick roller me 😂 but the video is very good
If your data is this important, run your storage in at least a raid 1 configuration. This way, you can afford to have a drive die without data loss.
bro definitely plays terraria.
This was also a very good video good job my guy ima sub right now
Ah yes a dolphin drowning
Just casually made the safest base
did your pc survive
go to 32:26 lol
So we are just going to ignore the most genius rick roll of all time?
I KNEW it would be never gonna give you up fr
Your determination to complete this project is unreal, great job.
I used to watch the domino videos
What Is That Auto Clicker I Need It
29:52 he used stacks of 64 for chicken eggs
22:10 you did say that at 0:34
what mods does wunba use?
you could just stack 100 of shulkers in one shulker and that shulker in anohter burh
Let this be a lesson as to why you ALWAYS backup your stuff. ESPECIALLY if you just fried your SSD and miraculously got someone to recover the data
I will do 100
i loved it i was sick today and you made me feel better
The fact that he rick rolled us all 😂
I Will sound annoying, but with a project of this scale I cannot fathom how can you not do It in creative There Is so much farming that my soul would go sterile, without counting the hundreds of hours wasted when you could do Better stuff Thinking about It makes me depressed
What's the name of the music in the background?
the poor chicken XD
44:18 why am I not surprised
New sub
This vid is veeeery confusing
He just recroll us
<3
this man is insane, great vibe. not gonna lie seeing that much sand flying through the portal was really sick
That was so awesome and entertaining !
did i juts got rickrolled?
i love your video
doing some math. 1.3 million cubic meters of tnt would have a blast yield of 2 megatons
I love how wunba lost thousands of files but saved his world and now he’s fine, Minecraft is the key to the soul
bro my life would die if I spent that long playing minecraft
44:06 NO WAY HE RICKROLLED US LOL AT THIS TIME 1,290,519 PEOPLE GOT RICKROLLED
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
i appreciated the rick roll 🫡
HEY I HAD THE SAME PC BUG IT SUCKED SO MUCH
Who hurt you bro💀
Omg❤ 😅😅😅😅😅
Psst! Can anyone give me free tnt world download 😢 i will give my special geometry dash level😮
Can you do a video where you have a subscriber build a million build
Glad I skipped to the last 90 seconds instead of wasting 46 minutes of my life.
11:41 when bro says he did some "off camera" building
Did he Just rickroll us in section 10:04 to 10:14?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
I'll do 50 push ups for every like this comment gets
40:40 the pure joy in his voice is just- he had so much fun with this man
Lets get an f in the chat for the chicken
largest amount of tnt ever exploded was 3million :/  the name of the guy doin it is Agentgb i think
ok but i had a domino phase when i was younger, and i actually recognized that white and black pyramid
Bro rickrolled me look at the orange words 10:03
bro just rickrolled us
king samolot on the bottom right 6:14
and u didnt account that one tnt is 5/9 gunpowder and 4/9 sand
he rickrolled us
HOPPER HOPPER HOPPER
36:36 *breathes in deeply*
2 milion subs video : making a 10x times bigger tnt than this one
Haiiiikooooo
At the 10 minute mark he secretly said never gonna give you up😂
14:04 nice cube collection
Dang
Bro that's soooooo big
I had flash back from when the other guy on YouTube lost his world because of too much falling sand Thank God your world survived
i cant be the only one realising we rickroled
NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP
I like how his voice sounded like it had autotune when he was spamming hopper
blockenheimer
W chicken
Now for the next video you need to create a biblically accurate angel
Damn, looking at the ram, your ram kinda dogshit to begin with. That gen of Ryzen specifically really likes nicely tuned ram, wouldn't surprise me if this bottlenecks your 5960X a ton. If your mobo supports it def try and get at least 3600MHz to get more out of your CPU.
Good 👍
always have backups people, tech isnt invulnerable
7:11 DID THE TOTEM BLINK OR AM I CRAZY
What a G
if you died i woulda laughed so hard that the earth would tremble
I just got rid roll
10:20 de bir ses duydum sanki
Everybody say rip to his PC
this video remembers me of another old video like this but in creative  Like if u remember!
bro almost rick rolled me 10:03
I will do 10 sit -ups every comment this gets!
build some more chain reactions
Bro created Minecraftheimer
I will do one push up for every like this comment gets
I am preety sure that the pc froze because of the auto clicker, you were clicking really really fast which caused your pc to freeze. That actually happened to me as well when i was testing the most cps i can get in minecraft with autoclicker.
Make sure the firmware is up to date on your new SSD. The Samsung 990 pro (and a couple similarly specced/priced drives) have a firmware bug that kills that crazy fast. Also, never fill your SSD more than 80-90% full, cuz that also kills them faster.  Also, backups don't have to be complicated. You can set up an automatic Google drive share, or OneDrive, Dropbox, etc, and set it to run for example every day at 5am. Or you can go hard mode and keep a local backup somewhere else in your house, but there's some open source tools to do that easier too.
mf really rick rolled in 2024
Mehhh ... 😒
30:45 Botem Pole
Do someone know the Name of the Autocrafter mod?
i fricking knew it was rickroll
alt title: "I became Oppenheimer in Minecraft!"
should take this as a sign to start regularly backing up your data get yourself a mechanical drive, at least, and back everything up ideally you should make 3 backups, 2 on site and 1 at another location, but you dont have to. better to have 1 than none also good to make another copy of super important stuff on a cloud service saves you money in the long run, and saves you headaches
Bro should get accepted to hermitcraft
bro really rickrolled us at the most best moment in minecraft💀💀💀
Awesome love your dedication
Mathematically its 12696 blocks of tnt so you went quite a bit overboard
dude that's awesome🤩 Your idea it's crazy ,good job😉
Did anyone got rickrolled?? 10:06 10:05
RICKROLL WARNING!
RICKROLLED. TWICE.
44:10 why.....
45:18 is the big boi explosion edit: poor chicken
you rick rolled us at 10 minutes... 😭😭😭
we must need to know that TNT is not condensed and does not explode in one place, but "scatters" around
so he died or wht
18:37 that screen always shows up on school computers lol
Bruh no way i just got rick rolled by note blocks
Goofy Mr. Beast aah video
I did the Math, 1 block of TNT = 1,818.8135 Pounds of TNT 1,818.8135*1,300,000 = 2,364,457,550 Pounds of TNT 2,364,457,550 Pounds is 1,072,499.9039 Metric tons 1 Million Metric tons = 1 Megaton, meaning this isn't stronger than the largest nuke seeing as the Tsar Bomb that was tested was 50 times stronger, and is .8 megatons less powerful then the strongest nuke in service today.
Man, this is the first tiem i've saw Wunba made a nuke, my first time seeing one, great work! Wunba.
Disgusting for you to sell the 1M subs special poster
I knew it would be rickroll music
And thus Minezilla has born from the TNT kaboom
10:00 best rickroll
The fact that the PC technician didn't tell you it's the mother board tells me he's either not good at his job, or he wants to make more money from you. SSD's last about 10 years if you don't use it to write, delete and rewrite all the time. SSD lifespans are determined by read and write cycles, and most SSD's can be rewritten completely over 100 times their capacities, so it takes years. SSD failure, especially after long usage from a reputable brand, usually indicates that something else is wrong.
I love how during his subscriber special he Rick rolled his entire audience dude’s a legend
Bro u should have showed impact of the collision from top
I actually like doing push ups do I will do 1 for every like this comment gets trust me
Can we see the damage?
"Now i have become death, the destroyer of minecraft."
The FBI reading this then getting mad it said *In Minecraft*
10/10 Content Bro My Computer Was Lagging just WATCHING this video
Assuming the TNT from Minecraft is equivalent to its real life counterpart, the 1,331,000 blocks of tnt weigh about 2,196,150,000 kilograms, which is just a little less than 2,2 megatons, more than the nuclear bomb "Fat man" (1,2 megatons of TNT), which was dropped on Nagasaki.
35:21 you should conquer the world with that master plan instead of playing minecraft
Shimmy shimmy yay shimmy yay shimmy ya
bro called water buckets redstone items🤣🤣🤣
ibet you have 1000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 subs😉😊😀😃😄😁👀🐔🐤🐦🐧🕊🦆🦢🦉🦤🦔🦇🐻🐻‍❄🐨🐼🦦🦨🦘🦡🐾🦃🦫🐳🐲🐕‍🦺🦮🐩🐕

Has this man ever heard of a little thing called grass? or the entire outside world that isn't through a screen?
amazing effort! All the smarts required to imagine this scenario - but no backup (at the very foundations of actual reality) - lesson learned my friend?
Hey qunba I know wat you look like… …                   I watched kingsammelot’s 202? Video

Can you tell me what shader is that ? 25:03
The last music… We rickrolled dude
44:06 WHY YOU RICKROLLED US😂
44:05 wow, I knew it! I knew you would put Fallout music there (like, you built a nuke)
you used world eddit
the Oppenheimer theme was so well placed
10:10 why does he need me
So much video and not showing the result of him surviving or flying throught the exploded hole ....
Why didnt you just play on creative
10:02 bro tried to sneak in a rickroll

Bro you really should be using a Hard Disk for critical storage; at least if they blow up you can almost always recover the data.
Bro why did you rick roll us? 44:20 😭
Oppenheimer got that quote from hinduism
What favour of pizza do you get?
Legends say that the domino pizza delivery guy is still waiting for Wunba to come back and take the pizza.

Big tnt wow

What blocks did you use for the shell?                Also, Jason looks more like a Dave or marc
At 32:36 i actually legitimately guessed the song was "never gonna give you up never gonna let you down"
So my ADHD brain was curious to see how badly your SSD screwed itself over:  The Samsung 990 Pro SSD has a little over 6.9kmb/sec read/write speed. 1 non-storage Minecraft block takes up about 2.5 bytes in each region file. You placed about 1728 blocks (1 shulker is 27 slots x 64 blocks) in about 26 seconds for ~66.4615 blocks per second. This means your region files were changed at a rate of ~166.1538 bytes per second, for a total change of 0.04984mb per autosave interval (every 5 minutes). Even if you account for placing a shulker every few seconds, the total number of shulkers in each chunk with the 1.3M blocks inside, your player NBT changing from a variety of sources, and other random things, you really only created about 0.061883MB worth of updates from the project spread across the region files in your world.   To put into perspective, the 5 sand dupers and shulker loaders probably cause more writes per second with just entities being created and destroyed.  What does this mean? A project like this shouldn't have caused that SSD to fail unless your Motherboard and PSU combo decided to randomly fry it. Your motherboard was probably fine, the PSU is the failure point, and IDK how your repair shop didn't see why it failed.
no chicken in the minecraft activating the nuke was harmed
BRO Rick Rolled us  Timer 10:03 Another rick roll 44:06
Why did you rick roll us singing "never gonna give you up"?
This is the definition of literally every hardcore world series. (Im not hating or something but i mean there are just all the same)
Can u solve a rubix cube

TNT is the best thing in monads
from russia 250 тысяч тон тротила
Bro rickrolled us 💀💀💀
WHY THE HELL RICKROLL
can i get the scematic of the tnt?
nah bros autoclicker went 1 trillion clicks per millisecond
I must say bud. I don't care for mine craft. But it was very fascinating watching your build. Turned out very cool. Great job.
Did anyone notice that the totem blinks?
🎉
fuck!
Now land it in ranked
faking
Bro destroyed his PC and still went on placing the TNT.😂
this is the best 1M subscribers celebration ever!
13:38 *What’d you think’s gonna happen to the PC.. i bet its gonna-* **fugging explodes** - Wunba 2024
This is INSANE!!!  great job!!!
Never gunna let you down
“Hey bro what did you do this weekend?”  “i farmed 150 withers, duplicated 5million sand blocks and spent half my brain power creating faster ways to move around in a video game”
this took so long editing and making just to entertain us thankuuu
Bro became Oppenheimer 💀
Bro. After an experiance like that, you should seriously invest in a RAID 1 data storage setup.
44:14 knew t would be a rickroll a warning to all pricede with caution ⚠️    People who fell for the rickroll 👇
3:39 when I heard that I felt nauseous 💀
I think you could have suvied ith just a normal small obsidian box
You culd have used a slime insted of frog light it will drop slime ball
this guy has lore
Subtle “never gonna give you up”.
wunba is killing his life for us…
Bro just had to include a secret Rick roll
Ohioooo
44:07
thats an odd way to get rick rolled
bro that chicken that u launched into the bomb "why me?"
20:54 and you set up automated regular (weekly at least, preferably daily) offsite backups, right?  right?  RIGHT?  Because if you haven't, this *WILL* happen again.
BRUHHH 10:16 WE GOT RICKROLLED:VVVVVVVVVVVVV
Bro that  was epic🔥🔥🔥
I love the part in 26:35 when the confetti explodes😂
So he did survive right? It didn’t show him in the obsidian cage during everything
no way he just rickrolled us 10:05 10:07 10:08 10:11 10:13
I can't believe that i got rickrolled on a minecraft video 10:13 💔
Someone please send help they are holding me captive and won't let me stop working until i finish the video! -  Wunba 2:44
which auto clicker did you use
That music was fire 🔥
9:51 hoppers just hoppers
I'm not subscribed to your channel and I was surprised that my YouTube didn't send me notifications, I felt stupid  😭 (I am subscribed now lol)
19:35 make sure to make backups, get a solid hard drive like a super high density one and backup your entire hard drive This can help prevent stuff like this
all this effort for youtube and views is just insane you deserve more subs!🎉
44:05 was actually a banger lol
Skip to 45:15 Thank me later.
what the ggs
this "nuke" is like a fart in the wind compared to the real thing, but i guess thats why youre a minecraft youtuber and not a physicist
I can't imagine being so devoted as to fry my pc for something like this.
sorry to breake the news... but minecraft might be the LEAST mathmaticaly acurate game ever made... and just remember that all it took to destroy a real city and kill thousands of real people, was the weight of a butterfly... cant do that in minecraft
did he survive?
Subscribe🎉
why did you have to bring jason into this... leave him out of the cringy minecraft video with the overdone editing
why was the first pc AMD and the seccond pc intel?
There is so much that could be said about this whole project, but I'll just pick this one:  That was absolutely the most elaborate Rick Roll in history. You just broke TWO world records here and I bet they'll remain yours for a VERY long time.  Wonder if the Guinness Records book would take the TNT record..? Probably would!
amazing video again Wunba but I knew from when you had said you made a song it was going to be a rick roll XD
For every ill do...                                            Absolutely nothing.
12:31
44:16 bro rickrolled us
9:49 HOPPPERS
https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxYGyFtcwbd6iao2jzyM3FBXLxRtAPDp7L?si=jPMn4i21MLVYq9rN  amazing song
So did you survive?
Bro rickrolled us twice... exceletn work! It had me clinging on my seat the whole time!
We know you used creative for this, but it was entertaining.
bro you have such will power man i respect that
W editor
Imagine if there was a thunderstorm and it struck the tnt before it was ready💀
bro has mr beast ahh progress transitions
What will bro do if he hits 2MIL!!😀
poor jason
rickrolled by minecraft
the thumbnail is very mathematical, you definitely didn't just add the word "mathematically" to seem technical
Noice music
Imagine igniting this in 2B2T😂
My uploading schedule is like month by month.
This is so satisfying
W for this man killing and sacurfice the his time for us  10:15 why did bro Rick roll us like 0.25x speed
bro for the egg graphic he had 64 eggs
10:05 bro just rick rolled us like we not gonna notice
the tnt isnt the nuke the pc is 😂
32:35 those who think its a rickroll
This was a really good video, but I've got to ask; What toppings were on the pizza.
your upload schedule so bad i bet i'd get 1b coins from my hypixel skyblock minions per video, equaling 245 billion coins making me one of or even the richest player in skyblock
I don't get it. Did he survive? It'd be cool to see more of the destruction if he did.
giga pc
The oppenheimer joke 💀
45:19 RIP Jim
How does bomb Stronger than a real life bomb? Think about it, it's ones and zeros on your computer.
Hey, I don’t mean to be rude but you should seriously start putting seizure warnings in your videos. I love the videos and I don’t personally have seizures but I don’t want to think about what could happen to someone. Again I don’t mean to criticize you, I just want to help.
That is nearly 3 MEGATONS of tnt
Bro,did we just get rick-rolled by a chain reaction ?!  44:10
U Rick rolled me!
🔵
Oppenheimer been real quiet after this one 💀💀
So the nuke he talks about most likely is the fat man nuke which was 20,000 mega tons of tnt and the largest nuclear explosion recorded from 1945-1981 was the tzar bomba a nuke worth almost 90,000 mega tons of tnt and modern nukes aren’t even that much, so 1,300,000 is a lot more than that needed!
What are those xp levels like 13 thousand
YEAHHHHH
real MrBeast vibes from this vid
There are WAY bigger
Omg that was big I love ur vids
If only the TNT exploded larger like an actual nuke would... Anyways, great video.
Bro has the Oppenheimer countdown fr 💀
If only the TNT actually worked like a nuke
"Hopper, Hopper, Hopper, Hopper."  *Godzilla had a stroke trying to read this and fecking died*
Needs a more accurate title.  How to stretch 3 seconds of game footage into 45+ minutes.
Bro rickrolled us in Minecraft😢
Yay I am now a bomb
i cant rn 10:00
.
I play on Nintendo (Don't make this a console debate please) and my friend found out how to spawn tnt and put in almost 20,000 tnt and I still cant open the world
Your posters look amazing 🤓
jort storm
You got my like on the  Oppenheimer quote
You can't have 64 chicken eggs! 29:52 🤓☝️
Why does every huge Minecraft hardcore project have to go downhill in some way or form at some point?! I just want to watch a regular Minecraft video without the guy going ‘my pc literally just stopped working and all my hard work has been thanos snapped into oblivion’ for once
The question remains: Is he alive or dead?
13:20 bro one Kubikmeter tnt is just 165 Gramms.
No joke at that point youd deserve to lose your world and your channel. You need to have a very large amount of special retardation to not 1. Install mc on a seperate hdd (minecfaft on an ssd is waste bc its java) 2. To not automatically backup important folders with a program ESPECIALLY when your income depends on it but also 3 repeating the same mistake AGAIN and not backing up IMMEDIATELY should anything happen in the future bc an ssd doesn't just fry like that especially not when playing fucking minecraft that hold approximately 0.00000001% load on that drive.  Dumb luck.
Can you do a 1000 player sim on this ravaged world, I think that would be sick
imagine if the sand and gravel chain reaction actually made a concrete powder pixel art of a tnt block, nonetheless this was amazing!
Why'd he have to Rick roll us at the end
Did u survive the blast?
Old Minecraft custom flatworlds would like to speak with you; full tnt world could chain explode for a decent about of time
7:22
Me in creative mode: hehe world edit :D
Never.       Gonna.         Give.        You.          Up
This is the best video I’ve ever consumed on this platform
I absolutely love the editing in this video! It's honestly the best editing for a MC youtube channel I've seen so far!
Shoutout to your new editor. I’ve seen a lot of your videos but this editor did some awesome work. Great job!
Subscribing for the dedication of completing this project even after having a PC fry it's SSD 2 times!
Can't be a wings vid without being Rick rolled
44:08 i hate you😂
Also this is my first time seeing your channel. You got a sub from me, watched about75% so far through and needless to say, you made me miss the days i would play Minecraft
"UGHHH" meme
The ending tho
Ngl I knew that was rickroll the moment you told us that the music is going to be a surprise
Imagine the chaos if Mojang added a gravity container block that could be duped with the portal
WHAT DID THE CHICKEN DO TO YOU FOR YOU TO EXPLODE IT
Noooo your sd card
we were rickrolled twice
41:05 why are there 2 wunbas?
GtaV be acting like they achieved something, but minecrafts been played way longer XD
why rick roll
this reminds me of that one old video of a giant tnt block building timelapse. nostalgia
33:09 cant listen to it rn but i swear to god if its a rick roll im gonna make toast in a bath
45 minutes for one minute of explosion. Glad I skipped through.
At the time of viewing he has 1.16m subs for context for future watchers.
What song was that?
Oooh...  That music...  You cheeky little...!
I knew it 44:22
I think your computer broke because it couldn't decide whether it had a Ryzen 9-5950X or an i9-14900K as the main CPU. That's kind of a crucial thing to get right. Probably could cause some SSD corruption seeing as the PCIe driver hardware tends to be onboard these days. Might be overclocking the memory something chronic as well, as it also can't decide if it's running DDR4-2666 or DDR5-4000.  Maybe something hooky in the motherboard BIOS? Which would then do bad things to the voltage supplies maybe.  BTW everyone, object lesson in the value of backups. Especially if you happen to habitually have a USB hard drive plugged in, which could fit the important parts of a 2TB main volume on it many times over and only need a few hours to fully duplicate. (Could the computer guy not have recovered your stuff onto a less volatile medium, so if the new SSD suffered infant mortality it could be duplicated straight onto another replacement?)  ...reminds me, I'm overdue to take an offline copy of my own recent files. Need to get on that before irony strikes.
The editing is amazing. The syncing of the beacon building to the music was 👌 Also I was so expecting the PC fried thing to turn into an ad for some prebuilt company, but thankyou SOOO much for not doing that. The actual TNT exploding deserved more screen time tho.
Just watching this video shows me this man is WAY to worthy of a sub and like
You could have also gotten god apples
Does this harm the chicken?
The lack of a good aftermath showing is a real anticlimax though. :(
Considering the size of each Minecraft project you do and the amount of time it must take to complete them + having the video edited justifies the "terrible" upload shedule.  The wait is well worth it! Keep it up! <3
You didn't say anything about survival Minecraft. * Generates 10M TNT blocks and blows them up
FAKER!!!Or at least that is what my eyes are telling me.By the way you can't stack shulker boxes. 1:49 Explanation creative mode. Big explosion :)
this is so awesome, the dedication to doing all of this was insane! i hope u continue to make amazing videos :)
Rick rolled use
i would be the type of person to do this whole chain just to accidentally set it off before it was time
was the frying related to how fast you placed the blocks? i wanna know so i can avoid this
Ah yes, that most crucial component of Little Boy that ensured it was able to flatten Hiroshima and melt thousands of residents: a pizza guy pushing over some dominoes. Gotta respect the dedication and sheer skill taken to pull that off whilst riding the bomb down to his doom XD Edit: 2.4MT? OK, replace that with some typical ICBM instead... :o   Gotta love a good Rube Goldberg machine anyway, as well as proper somewhat real world valid radiation/explosion protection. And huge respect for doing all of it in hardcore rather than just spawning it in creative or using a map editor. Damn. Don't even mind the Rickroll, and got to learn about the existence of Gravity Trax marble runs...
Feel like there was a Rickroll subliminal message at 10:15 but I don't know,  maybe not
I will do 1 push up for every like this comment gets i bet i wont have to do 1😅
Eh
and i will not let young me down *oo look a creep- AHHH*
Hey Wunba, just want to say congrats on 1,000,000 subscribers. I've been tuning in for a while now and it's so amazing to see how much your channel has grown and how amazing your content has become. Way to go keep making amazing content my mans.
I will do 10 push ups per 11likes
This video is basically the good old " i mined off camera ”
Why was your totem blinking.
There's no radioactive fallout, so it's like an N2 Mine from Evangelion.
16:51 The great reset vibes
24:13 HIS TOTEM BLINKED
Bro turned into Oppenheimer
uhh, have you ever heard of watching from a distance? 34:25
just rediscovered your channel. i watched the domino videos but i didn't know that was you and you had a new channel!
the chicken riding in that minecart into the heart of the TNT, was the real MVP.
ok but did you survive? what about this giant shelter where you hid?
We just got Rick-rolled 44:04
yah thanks we relly wanted to be rick rolled. hahaha;)
16:50 Josh the dolphin.
Fr thought he was gonna steal from Cubicmetre
just 5 days late
Hi
I will do 1 push-up for every like this comment gets!!!
Wumba’s poor alt account probably got decimated cause he wasn’t in the obsidian box
This is so wild and stupidly big it’s almost a parody of the other big YouTubers, except it’s done completely in earnest
Tbh, one simple obsidian Chamber is enough to protect you😂
bro we got rickrolled
this might be the video that has the most dedication in the entire history of youtube
shout out to your “chat” they are very smart in sharing ideas to help you run this project faster
This is the coolest way to say i have no life
Nice transition
I legit thought he would rickroll us with the music one lol.
this Rick roll 💀 44:07
Rick roll? 💀
Mocking about a bomb that caused hundreds of thousands of deads
blud still got 4.1k dislikes
A ryzen 5950X is a flex even for Intel users 😆 🤣 😂   I have a Ryzen 7 5800x3d and its completing with an i7 13700KF which is a 2 generation difference... Ive ran into the same issue of freezing midgame and the Bios inerror screen😢 I hate having NVME dieing before SATA
17:16 bruh
Damn minecraft youtubers must be the most obsessive people on the entire planet
wow crazy vid bro
me after taco bell
Oppenheimer exploded a real nuke in real life and he had less safety precautions 😂
41:06 WTF
bro 10:02 was the best rick roll iv ever seen lol
2:45 Bro screamed on low volume 😭
I knew the song would be a f*ckin Rick roll
I can’t believe I got Rick rolled
43:05 I kept repeating throughout the whole fuse that that little bit of music was gonna be a rickroll. Ive never felt more accomplished
I knew it was going to be never gonna give you up when i saw the subtitles
oh wait your fine
People that realized the rick roll song 44:07
bro im 20 min in and im so sorry you lost it all
10:03 this entire sequence is a rickroll, look at the orange text
I have a question, is this more power full then the tsar bomb?( it was 35km of destruction)
I legit used to watch those Domino videos when I was younger!! That's crazy!
Wunba could probably become an engineer but hes making content for us lol.
42:48 because *boat.*
I knew the song would be that
Every second of this video is a legendary moment in Minecraft that will become history
my man acc managed to rickroll us 🤣🤣🤣🤣
HOPPERS
thank you for making this video.  I happened to see it today, after having a really unpredictably weird (not necessarily hard but just weird) day. The editing and tone of it just was what I needed right now. So thank you.
Mr beast ahh video
This is what modern insanity looks like.
I think all Minecraft YouTubers schedules are messed up bro it ok
Good grief, the *premise* for this video was neat, but it was so obnoxious to watch.
wunba and mello should collab
so did you die? what did it look like after?
someone should break his record just to piss him off
i guessed the song i knew i was gonna get rick rolled ...
You can just use mud for clay
dude actually did an awsome vid just to rickroll 1M PPL
4:29 CUBE SPOTTED
Name the old clanal and we all will sub
44:07 That was a Mrwhosetheboss esque rick roll
We got Rickrolled guys.
Respect 😢
Screw the complex Redstone doors, vaults, and traps, THIS is peak Redstone machinery right here.
Bro really rick rolled us at 10:00-10:20
10:21 i was going to buy one until you rick rolled me
👏👏👏

Wait... you never showed the full final explosion
On commet

I knew it was a rickroll from the moment he said he would make music.
wait, youre ending your hardcore world?
bro put a rickroll in it
:O
I love how in the collection of the resources for the improved storage system there was a rick roll.
I find this video very emotional, thank you for not giving up!! I enjoyed watching you build, talk and show your interests. I love you man and I thank you for spending all these money and time for us!  …And a happy valentines!   As one silly old villager would say:   hAUUUUU, Haah, Hrmm.                                        -de la villager from da village       P.s the whole time I was wondering if you were gonna make a new copy of the server before blowing the TNT off, when I saw you did I was relived!!!!!!
Never gonna give you up
Not a fetishist myself but as a graphist with OCD eyes, why the fuck your feet are blurred out at 32:38 ? xD
I got rick rolled bruhhhhhhhhhhhh
Bro thinks he's oppenhimer
also would been sweet if used some texture pack to make the obsidian and water see thu so that way yoyu can watch the explosion while your in the box.
I wanna know the reaction of the repairman after you came to him again after 3 days for the same issue lol
you sied made a woeld download but dont see a link to it on your video?
Wunba we got the same keyboard and it has the same spacebar I swear and I got thesame problem those white spots ❤
The fact that he did this in SURVIVAL MODE
●_●
You be living on superflat because of all the dirt platforms
At 10:03  The orange Text rick rollsThe orange text rick rolls us Text rick rolls
I guess wumba was sleeping for 2 months straight after 36 hrs
1:50 when he was placing the shucker boxes it looked like creative
wait were u safe after the blast?
Why dos the totem blink
Only Wunmba could rickroll everybody on minecraft
Did… Did that totem just blink? 24:12
did i just got rick rolled..? ...never mind i just got rickrolled second time.
Alternate title - I Built a TNT block so big it broke my computer.
was there seriously no videos saying that if you boot straight into the bios its your drive that's broken?
As a German i like Nuclear bombs ... Wait a sec    Ah, i shit in my pants
Or you could’ve just used an auto crafter
BRO NOT THE RICKROLL🤪
I’ll do five push up every like this comment gets

put ur n word passes     👇
I knew it was going to be a rick roll at the music section
Wunba should make a smp with mogswamp and other Minecraft creators it would be the most technical and amazing Minecraft server
I subscribed for the music that played at 44:05. Absolutely loved the video 😎
Imagine someone snipes this guy for "faking videos"
#W PEZ
maybe i suggest saving ur world before the explosion so u dont lose the nuke and continue the explosion over and over.
but did you die?
I want to ask you a question , you are a speed cuber? Other question, how many second do you solve the 3x3? Im just interested.😅😊
bro really thinks that he is oppenheimer in 1945💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
I saw this video and I couldn't not subscribe. You made Minecraft History. If this doesn't make you a fully-fledged Minecraft youtuber I don't know what would.
what auto clicker do u use?
You can just farm nether earth to make nether wart blocks
wow i did not think the song will be that smooth lol 44:20
Wunba was never seen again after this video. Either he blew himself up or the fbi kidnapped him :(
My fav part was the rickroll definitely
44:13 bro Rick rolled everyone us and we are waiting to get rickroled 😭😭
people who got rickrolled  👇
Made of: TNT Name: Big boi
Hi wunba i realy like your videos and and since you dont have any big structures in nether why dont you build a lava castle or something
That's definetely not the world record
Not the asmr Rick roll ToT
37:37 "falling all the way up" splendid, enrgish
You know what's really funny. My guy used the pizza from Terraria for the pizza icon. Which I find is funny because everyone calls Terraria 2D Minecraft. It's not DON'T SAY THAT IT IS anyways that's funny
Love the secret rickroll 😂
its so cool how he use emerald like its nothing
seeing castcrafter here was a bit surprising
Never gona give you up in 10:10
Did he rickroll us
"let's go!!"
Nobody noticed we got rickrolled?
Bro cooked minecraft
No someone had 14 million TNT in hardcore mode
when i heard the music the start of the music i fought it was rickroll
you rickroled us 2 times
this is crazy
Turn to our lord and saviour Jesus Christ so you can enter his kingdom of God and change your and others lives and souls in Jesus precious and almighty name amen and amen ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😊😊😊
Better off doing this in creative but creds fir doing not in creative
Bro this is the best Minecraft vid I have ever seen but bro It took u a month to finish the video
When we geht the World Download
That was the coolest thing I have ever seen in years
imagine if his computer just went black and didn't turn on again
ARE YOU--?! You Spent *45* minutes of my time... and DIDN'T EVEN ACTUALLY SHOW THE AFTERMATH?!?!  Fucking.. This is the last time I commit myself to anything like this ever again.
You defenetly made me, a technical player, click that video. It actually is quite possible and as raysworks shows, actual mathematically accurate nukes in minecraft exist and are beatiful I recconmend checking it out Wumba.  Also congrats for 1m (1,16 now)
nicE
I love how this is his hardcore world😅😅😅😅😅
Better video than the movie Oppenheimer ❤
4:28 you know... I don't mean to be rude or anything but.... You're clearly insane 💀
you rick rolled us
I'm also going making that thing and I'm going to die in real life
funfact your bomb was 48.5 TIMS stronger than THE Z A R BOMB THE STRONGEST NUCLEAR WEAPON ON WEARTH!48.5 TIMES!
must be the most insane video I have ever watched!
Mind Blowing..  :D
10:13 never gonna give you up
how to make braking block animation gone pls tell me
please get a server
New editor is nice😂😂😂😂
That was awsome w vid
Well clearly you're a fan of Rube Goldberg and his contractions that's evident everything else I have no idea why you have 1.16 million subscribers or how active they are but I will tell you that was the most annoying on inspiring uneventful ending to a video ever I warned you no points at no time did you uttering coherent sentence and we are all poor for listening to you you need better oratory skills get to the point already 46 minutes for that yeah you owe me 46 minutes and change
😄
😭
🎉
a creative mode minecraftian: "just use bedrock bro ☠"
dude obviously doesn't have experience with nuclear weaponry that would be in megatons, not kilotons
never back downnever what
that was like an asteroid impact, just with random pillars of water
I will do 10 push-ups for every like this gets
I have three nicknames for you 1) THE GOD BUILDER 2)THE TRY-HARD 3)THE BUILD COOKER
I'm glad that I can see this moment of a legend in minecraft creating world record     Also bro is censoring his feet 💀
least deranged minecraft hardcore player
36:32 gravitrax
damn i loved this one
Happy Valentine’s Day
How do you farm gunpowder with a raid farm?-
i love this documentary
Hello
10:03 aint no way i get rick rolled like this... P.S. this is one of my most favourite minecraft videos of all time and most definitely your best video yet! keep up the awesome work wunba!
10:34
45:40
Did you took into account the size of each block and so on?
what was that song you used ? that went DUH duh DUH DAH .....  DUH da DUH da
As a Redstone guy myself, lots of your machines were kind of inefficient, like for example the way you powered the chicken dispensers. Also for the wave machine, you could probably just have turned it on once to remove the rails, and you could have just cycled the pistons for the beacons once instead of replacing all the iron blocks manually. But in the end im kind of proud that  you built so many contraptions at all.   Oh and with your SSD, a data recovery specialist might be able to recover the files from your broken SSD, and idk what happened to the first SSD, but in theory if you were able to clone that once you should be able to do that twice, for the >important files<. Though the specialist could get expensive
´´hoppers ,hoppers,hoppers,hoppers´´ is my favorite line
Dude! Backups my man! I recommend an automated service like BackBlaze. Just point it at your folders with important data and let it run! it should send copies to cloud storage. OneDrive, iCloud Drive, or Code42 also work!
happy valentines wunba :D
Minecraft players are really crazy ngl
WOAH GUYS AT 39:27 I JUST SO REALISED THAT THE TOTEM OF UNDYING CAN BLINK ITS EYES THATS SO COOL AND I DID NOT KNOW ABT THAT AT ALL DUDE😱😱😱
Did u survive
18:47, Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete, then click restart. Then it will say emergency restart. You will click on it and then it will fix.
Bro made Tsar Bomba
10:22 yes very good editor indeed
love shell(:
29:52 bruh eggs can only stack to 16
rickrool lol
13:02 these animations are sick lmao good work
Can't believe I wasted 45 mintues to get rick rolled
Does wunba know how to solve a rubix cube?
How much damage does this nuke deal?
THE AMOUNT OF Patience THAT THIS GUY HAS IS UNBELIEVABLE
Bro rickrolled us
10:28 bad lol
don't put minecraft save on an SSD, put minecraft on it if you whant but the save must be on an HDD or SSHD (it's new it seem), minecraft use the SSD slot too fast
Is no one gonna talk about the rickroll
That is 1.3 kiloton worth of tnt while the smallest nuke is 25 kiloton and the biggest is 50000 kton cmon man this is clickbait
Pls reply to this wunba
kamikaze chicken
10:23 Did we realy just get rickrolled???
whoever came up with the idea to use water is a genius! Holy crap that goes fast!
The rickroll:
13:05
shell deserved the world rekord with you(:
Man who saw the never gonna give you up 😂 👇
45:24 is when it deonates. (amazing vid btw legendary dedication well done)
Noo why were the feet blured
ITS actualy Not possibleto place 66 Blocks per second   The Maximum is 20 Blocks per second thats because Minecraft is rendert 20 Times per second ( in Ticks per second TPS) so there are youst 20 Things possible per second
44:04 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
WOW
Like this comment to get rickrolled immune from this video
Omg the efforts put into this, my lazy  ass can never
34:00 @castcrafter
L rickroll
10:05 bro really Rick rolled us and thought we wouldn't find out😅
Lol, I have a laptop and made a flatland world with 164 layers of TNT and light it up and my computer shortly had 1 fps but didn’t crash. It‘s a five year old laptop and not even too strong, not able to stand my VR-glasses, not able to play grounded, but can stand infinite tnt.
this is the bomb we have to fear.
10:05 great rickroll
Great job, was amazing to watch
my mom s safety level is as that much xd
make a custom superflat world that's fully tnt. Get a flint and steel, and then make it boom. too easy.
10:04  rickroll …. just wait😔😞😟☹️🙁😕😐🫤🙂😌😊☺️😀😃😄😁😅😆😂🤣😇💀💀😈😈
Couldnt you you have made minecart chests and filled them with items to dupe in the end since it is a falling entity Edited for grammar
32:41 damn, not for free
44:20 did you just rickrolled us all in minecraft?
13:32  its metratonnes not kilatonnes
u should made it in nether
10:04 did I just got Rickrolled..
no way we got rickrolled
10:13 never gonna give you up!
wait so you're telling me that you are my childhood and i didnt knew it?
i just got rickrolld
This guy kinda looks like MatPat, but that's just a THEORY
Imagine placing so much tnt that you had to pay for storage upgrade and a new mother board
Respect !
Aint no way bro was able to rickroll us twice 💀
you could've just used a hopper below an ender chest that is connected to an storage system so you'd instantly transfer the shulker boxes of gunpowder and if the storage was too far you could just build an chunk loader
still Great Work wow
BRO RICKROLLED US
The rick roll💀
no way i got rick rolled by a nuclear chain reaction in Minecraft
44:12 man Rick Roll everyone
why was the second music was rickroll
o^mgt
lamo I skipped to 45:17 from the start   I clicked for the explosion and and got it :D
AUGHH I GOT RICKROLLED FUUUU
2:43
Wow anti-climactic 😂
Can you pls show us the damage in the next vidio pls
Tbh, i already know the song is gonna be a rickroll, he said some secret word when he's collecting the items being "never" "gonna" "give" "you" "up".   Im already being an detective from this video...
We got rickrolled
1+ sub to wunba = 1 like on this comment and 1 tnt
POV when u name ur sheep jeb and then name another sheep bonemeal and sheer both of them when they are in 1 block
and... you didn't automate it using a bot o.O
I will do 1 sit up for every 5 comments
Old editer: help
can u share ur mod list please
Bro If you will die in a hardcore world just use blast protection enchantment
Bro scared me with the pc frying and losing the world
why did you play rick roll on that
From 10:03 to 10:15 , all of the colored words that he said is the rickroll song (colored words : never , gonna , give , you , up )  Also from 44:06 ; the music is called “Never gonna give you up” , too 😂😂😂 (that was the second music Wunba created )
Nahhhh i think he can make one bigger
Bro what happened to the pizza part?
so did you live?
naca pc
2:58 Nice detail, saying Oppenheimer's quote on his views on making the atom bomb, which you actually said you wanted to make, great job man Edit: Lol, in 45:51 you actually showed the footage, great job man
The dedication of Wunba and his confidence is truly great. Excellent work done by Wunba.👏
can someone give me schedule mod
How many of us just skipped to the end?
WadZee would've really needed this in his netherite beacon vid
OMG Gravitrax :D

THIS IS SO COOL! :OOOOOOOOOO
WOW
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! HOW DOES THIS NOT EVEN HAVE 1 MIL VIEWS?
bro just quoted opppenheimer
0:01 BRO YOU GOT SCAMED YOUR PC DIDNT BROKE MY PC ALSO PUTS ME IN THAT SCREEN AND A JUST CLICK F1(after this itunes will put you in another screen then  you have to go up right click and then you click discharged and done) Thank's for reading and of course what a spectacular work 🎉
you are crazy
WHO SAW THE TOTEM BLINK???
41:05 theres another wunba  on the sand
We waited 44 minutes to get Rick rolled
Wunba has Kylian Mbappe      Where....   In his bare Hands
0:12 you know someone did just make a super flat world and lit it up
Firstly, people have done more TNT than this. I've done a million before and I'm on a laptop. Secondly, this is not a 'mathematically accurate nuke'. It's just not.
The Rick roll part is the reason I subscribed
we got rick roll in the notes......
Pc: 💀
That chicken died for a reason
Ain't noway I just got rickrolled in 5 seconds(10:07 till 10:12)
renew your pc immediately
nobody is talking abt how this guy just rick rolled us
Lol the rickroll at 10:02
Never gonna give you up secret message😮
2.4 kt of tnt  not bad but not in Mt 😢 (search up Tzar Bomb)
did ja live?
Mathematically accurate you say? In a video talking about how storng steve is I heard that 1 block of tnt is eqivalent to 910 sticks of dynamite  1 stick of dynamite has 1 mega jolue of energy  a typical nuke has the power of 250,000 tons of tnt converting that to mj is 1046000000mj  1046000000 divided by 910= 1,149,450 blocks of tnt you used 1331000 blocks of tnt meaning you actually overran the estimate by quite abit
the royalty free music at 2:05 sounds so much like the basis of Jort Storm by Slimecicle because IT IS! he used royalty free music which i find so funny because youtubers that have maybe no idea who he is remind me of Jort Storm's existence!
you just got yourself a new subscriber
give kingsammelot his play button back
27:55 Do totems blink isaw that in vid😮
For the screen problem you have, if you'd press f2, it would normally work.
12:43 i bet the next pippenfts video is gonna be like: "i collected 10 million tnt"
I literally didnt know the totem of undying could blink
I know i till get rick roll but is till wait for the tnt for explo
Sorry but why didn't you do like a OneDrive backup or something of your world? You can just place the world folder in your documents and create a symbolic link from where it used to be to the new location. That way it will back up constantly without you needing to do anything.
Yoo im gonna need this designs litematic file
Bro just Rich rolled 800.000 Dudes while collecting materials
I LOVE THIS VIDEO SO MUCH THAT I DIDN'T SKIP A SECOND!!    AND I SHEARED THE VIDEO TO MY 82  FRIENDS!!!🥰🤩 I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😍😍😍😍
did wunba just rick roll us with that music
I love the incredibly cinematic backstory leading up to a big explosion that uses a metaphor of a you as a kid building dominoes for days on end just to topple them on a channel you had before you main one... WAIT A MINUTE DIDN'T MOGSWAMP DO THE SAME THING WHEN HE BLEW UP HIS END ISLAND!????
Poor pizza guy you kept waiting for 10 minutes
I had a similar problem with my ssds failing after my pc froze. Where did you find the info that the motherboard was the issue?
Genius
bro to survive the boom you can just make an obsidian box 4x4x4 and get inside it. thats it.
Bro just Rick role us😬😬😬😬
Minecraft videos in 2009: I build a 10x10 wooden house   Minecraft videos now: real life mathematical nuke powerd by a complex redstone chain and my pizza delivery guy in hardcore minecraft.

hoppers
U are the best wunba i follow you for years 😢 9:27
Why is there fire in-front of all the nether portals
Did I just get rick rolled
your old channel has never died wunba. I remember watching your videos when I was 6 all the way to 9 yrs old and now I see, 4 years later,  how it has evolved. I'm sticking to this channel to the very end
He wont need the mod when the Mumbo block comes to minecraft lmao
And now you have a pizza to celebrate with.
Seems like every time you accomplish something amazingly hard something bad always happens 😂
44:08 HE RICKROLLED US...
did it take a year?
i literely played a cookie clicker after this  🍪🍪🍪
Bro reckrolled us 44:07
i was heartbroken when the computer broke but it was all for a good cause!!!
44:13 nAH RICK ROLL!?!?!
Rick roll
nothing: 44:06 Me: wait... did 809k+ people get rickrolled? *dies inside*
rick roll
I used to watch your channel when you would create domino chain reactions! I think I was in like grade 6 or 7, now I'm a college student :o
I feel bad he had to get that oak button 😔 Best of wishes to you Wunba, that oak button probably took months. If not, years.
Did you survive?
you rickrolled us
can I use part of your video in my own? Of course, with a mention of your
The obsidian cage was a bit overkill but sick video
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=KmPJoOiWpX9Cvd-J
10:04 sounds like he’s whispering the Minecraft version of the pokerap
Should’ve used ancient debris instead of obsidian
I cant do this anymore
dad rickroll got me...
Æ
From this video, You earned a sub and I bought a poster! Keep up the good work! 😁
how did you do this, why did you do this?!
Sneakiest rickroll ever
This is the opposite of low effort hardcore content
Pls don’t like it…
I will do one push up for every like this gets!
really good video man. but incredible disapointed with the end. and by that i mean the explotion itself, really wanted to see the explotion without shaders or anything, just see it how you would see it playing the game. also would have loved seeing your own reaction to the explotio. but yeah im pretty sure the reason you did it this way is like you said if your world crashed and broke from this you wouldnt play it again. and im pretty damn sure even pc's at nasa couldnt handle all those particle effects from all those tnts. the other option is that you maybe used a mod or something to turn of the particle effects so your pc could handle it. and that is why the tnt looked like it just deterrioradet instead of exploding
The reason it’s not world record tnt is because Guinness copyrights those vids
good job
Win a name reveal some can refer to this god to his real name
Damn that was good
Can you unprivate the old domino video
Oppenheimer more like Dolphinheimer
This was the first video I watched and already I decided to subscribe.
Jason *vine boom* 22:18
Rick rolled us
He singed "never give you up" while collecting the materials to build auto storage machine
ive blown up more in 100 layer tnt layer superflat on minecraft 360😪
i knew he'd rickroll us with the song
I knew when he was placing down note blocks that there was going to be a rickroll
24:13 his totem blinked😮
Did we really just get Rick rolled?!!?🤣😭😑 Subtle😂
Spoiler alert: The explosion is big.
I LOVE TNT!!!!!
I’d say that was well worth it good job
I will sing skibidi toilet for every like this comment gets
10:03 bro became flint lockwood lol great job on this!
Around 10 minutes "Never gonna give you up"...😄😀😆😅😆
I will do 0.00000000000000000000000001 push ups for every like
Bruh from 10:03 until 10:15 he rickrolled us 😂😂😂
Hi
Now make one that is a tenth the power of the Tsar bomba!
10:17 bro rickrolled us
yo you finally uploaded
what do you use to get the schematic
There was a video made 11 years ago where 27.5 million blocks of tnt were placed so that world record isn't true by a long shot.
OP OPPENHEIMER STYLE
You desserts 10 million subscribers with the effort you put in for this video! Sheesh
i thought is said i accedently build a accurate nuke in minecraft
44:14 bro rick rolled us 💀💀💀
Congratulations! This video was amazing!
now remove the "in minecraft"
i lov the part where it says hoppers
Hello I am your new subscriber
You NUKED it!!! 1:50 And... why did it look like placing the shulker boxes in creative; the number of them in your inventory didn't change.
At the part after he says hoppers a lot he kind of secretly rickrolls you
18:42 if this happens again, just know you have to do f3/f2, that always happened when i turned on my old pc and the method was that, it never broke. Edit: well it did "break" (it was fixable) but like 1-3 years after doing that, this is my experience but its still smth that could work
boom
Dude. The amount of work that you spent on this is unreal. When I was about 9 I used to spend countless hours making domino chain reactions and I love the way you incorporated that lore into this video. Great job man!.
we got rickrolled
what autoclicker do you use?
I've seen multiple channels blow up way more TNT, some 10M+ But never in Hardcore. Nice.
this was on my for you page and your dedication alone has earned you a sub from me good job wunba.
10: 5 he tries to rick roll us
44:05 congrats Wunba on 1M BUT I CALLED IT AND IM DISSAPPOINTED IN YOU
Now place around 40 more of these to make a tsar bomba in Minecraft (bomb would be so powerful it can blow up your pc from a game)
Is that the instreumental used in Jort Storm?  23:01        You gotta listen closely
Him: this is probably the most tnt made in in hardcore minecraft Me: thats probably the most tnt made in all minecraft modes. (except for maybe creative mode)
Tsar bomba with 50,000 Kilotons 🗿
Wunba, you need to get a NAS to backup your world ASAP. Also great video.
man we need a new version of a biden blast. this mf: 'Wunbomb.'
The villagers 😂
Bruhhhh at the end of it you had to put rickrole music didn’t you😒
10:03 bro really sneaked in never gonna give you up😂
Did bro rickroll is
i subscribed just for that flip during the 1M sub thanks
Thie guy is awsome 😊
bro that much tnt can ACTUALLY break bedrock
I knew he would rick roll us
I JUST GOT RICKROLLED 10:04
4:14 realised at this point the video flows well and the timelapse of building that farm for gunpowder was potrayed nicely
bro, Wunba and I literally have the same upload schedule 🤣
rip important files this vid is pretty cool
I wish I was as excessiful as you you're lucky
3:13 such a creative way to potray the idea of crafting it
Does anyone know what the song at 20:20 is called?
2:42 you are just copyin me at this point
2:35 relatable how you can discover random stuff like this on doing creative things (like the TNT base, running into the floor, etc)
Naa, esto no es nada, y eso que esto es megalomania pura pero nada superara nunca al beacon de Nederite en multiplayer.I do hope now you have a Clowd back up plan for the entire files of your computer , and you learned that if I happens once it will happen again
Wunba watched Oppenheimer
I will samck my controller each like this gets
0:26 the idea of chain reaction is creative
10:03 I got rickrolled 😮
What was wrong with the last editor?
Do you have a world download for the tnt explosion
-Use an auto crafter to make TNT-  Cheat and use a mod to make TNT
10:02 did anyone else notice that he rick rolled us?
for breaking the end portal frames, if you center it correctly, then u can do it all in 1 go
1.3 million blocks of TNT is 1.3 million cubic metres of TNT, with TNT having a density of 1650kg per cubic metre, this gives us 2.145 megatons of TNT. while this is a greater yield than both Little Boy, and Fat Man, and even larger than the current largest bomb the US has in its arsenal, its nowhere close to a Tsar Bomba, and even falls short of the R-12 missiles, deployed by the Soviets during the Cuban Missile Crisis  before you yell at me because this exact math is in the video, i wanted to put an exact scale onto exactly how large this blast is, since saying "larger than hiroshima" doesn't actually tell you anything
I will do 1 situp for each comment
This looks like a mrbeast vid
all of this... just to hear THAT SONG
I GOT RICK ROLLED \:
Guys Subscribe Wunba Deservers it for this
new editor is great, love the video!

Did they just not mention that the song is never going to give you up?
Ah yes, using a thermonuclear bomb in minecraft. As Oppenheimer intended. "Shout out to Oppenheimer for the idea!" got me on the floor laughing.
I can't believe Wunba has to blur his feet for the creeps.
w
28:19
I knew it was this song 44:14
Bro when wunba was talking about the chain reaction stages about halfway thru, he said he did not mention the intensity. but he did! Thx wunba for providjng me with quality content, keep up the good work!
Pls upgrade the PC maybe the PC know what is gone happen😅
I knew he was going to rick roll us
Id love to see a full video about the aftermath
Hi
Just sayin’ you could’ve used torches instead of signs.
People who seen the zombified piglin in the Obsidian cube   👇
I’m not from 2015 I’m from 2014
This was awesome btw I grew up watching you
rick roll at 44:00
Jokes on you I like Rick roll.😂😂😂
he rick rolled us at 10:00
Eol farm makes like a shulker of gunppwder a 10 min
44:10 TWICE IN ONE VIDEO????
1.3mil cubic meters of TNT (irl) nahhh
the most legendary rickroll ever
I thought I was already subscribed to you
But the question I have on my mind is……..did you survive the 1.3 million tnt explosion?
Bro just became Oppenheimer himself
did leave a crater about the size of a 30 megaton bomb    but can it fit on a plane?
Bro really Rick rolled us....lmaooo
I KNEW IT WAS GONNA BE A RICK ROLL LOL I CALLED IT THE FIRST TIME I SAW IT
this was such a sigma video!!
Yo I know spent time on this awesome build and it looks amazing, could never build that. Just found your channel too, +1 sub!
Continue dude you're awesome thank you for that video ❤
11:53, you know there is an auto crafter right
Three Shrek movies is good choice bro
10:13 DANGIT, CANT BELEIVE YOU DID THAT
What movies did you watch?
Browse the Oppenheimer of Minecraft
Why did you rick roll us
gotta love that very hidden rick roll 10:03
Did i just get rickrolled twice,😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
the toilet paper les go
Why would you take your device to a repair shop?? Are we living in Punjab in 2008 and I didn't get the memo?
Yea just 143 beacons
This video got some serious Mr Beast vibes in the editing.
44:08 I was not expecting that to happen
10:00 bro rlly rickroled me
You would love waystones
I knew it was a rickroll from the moment you said you were making a song for a suprise.
the way bro casually said "so i just killed 143 withers..."
Oh shoot he rickrolled us 44:00
What autoflicker du u have wunba ?
I love your new editor
Once of the best and entertaining videos ive ever watched.. thank you for your efforts ❤️‍🩹
No way he hit us with a never gonna give you up😂
No way. I remember putting one of your domino videos in a PowerPoint presentation I made at school. THAT WAS YOU?!
Hi new editor
i love you
bro pls touch some grass
Did no one point out that the totem blinked at 43:00
Why’d you have to let the chicken die :C
congrats with 1 mil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i love the rick roll and the big boom keep it up
New editor is fire! 🔥
Bro made a whole video blowing up his PC just to rickroll us 💀
45:16  There's the boom
GOD DARNET I KNEW IT WAS GONNA BE A RICKROLL
Imagine a creeper blows it up half way building
10:15 bro actualy rickroled us
wait! He was that domino Guy I used to watch!!
At 10:03 he rickrolls us, look at the orange words
It's ridiculous that this thing is still around 20 times less powerful than the Tsar Bomba. Granted, the Tsar Bomba was a hydrogen bomb.
Bro rickrolled up
👁👄👁 👁👄👁 👁👄👁 What in the world Is this man thinking
The explosion was so big, it fried your pc from the future.
Have you noticed the "Never gonna give you up" rickroll from 10:05 to 10:12?
Only 1.3 mil? I set off an entire tnt run world and now I cant open it XD
Crafter is added in 1.21
he wont say what the note blocks play my rickroll senses r tingleing
How about Mrbeast? He made a whole Minecraft of tnt and blew it up
hEY SB737
That’s really cool and I’m sure it took a really long time and I appreciate the dedication but a accurate nuke in Minecraft would be anywhere between 5 TNT and 30,303,030 TNT because in Minecraft every block is 1 cubic meter and TNT is a full block that makes it 1,650 kg (or 3,637.627 lbs) and a nuke is anywhere between 5 tons and 50 megatons
GUYS HELP HIM HE HELD CAPTIVE HIS ARCH NEMISES
This is the first video I’ve watched of this guy and I already love it
10:05.. well, that's one way to rickroll someone 😂.
44:16 nice one wunba
Wow awesome video Wunba!! Well done you!! You should be proud I enjoyed watching it :))
Hi
4:29 what cube do you have?
Bro 0.1 sec of explosion…
Could've used the Autocrafter
38:27 zombie in day? Is this modded?
Insanely impressive
Not a record ngl looks cool tho
why so many hoppers
I want to see you with a moustache
Yo wunba what if you built a base that was like the ones the 7-year olds build in creative, but in hardcore? Like a ton of diamond blocks, emerald blocks, and stuff
Oh my god this is the most crazy video I've ever seen 😮😮😮
Ni way i never knew this → 27:53
Rick roll song💀💀💀💀
yk almost all is exploded in air? and only 10% is affected on ground?
Imma just say it, This is better than your Black hole video! Cause it was just pure hype and suspense the whole way through❤
Bro even searched the GERMAN vid from castcrafter
blink blink blink X100 im sorry WHAAAAAAAAAAAT the hell
Did I just get rick rolled twice in one video?😂😂😂
Nice Rick Roll.
Holy shit, dude.

Bro just Rickroll me 10:00

There’s always a moral in Wunba’s videos ✨
This guy is the definition of "I did a little mining off camera"
FUCK U FOR RICK ROLLING MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
44:07 I liked you, until this very moment...  Frick you!!!
The music was Rick roll
Hi, been watching the original wunba channel years ago now, it's good to see you again through Minecraft! Really nice editing and overall effort, great video!
it was the funniest thing i have seen these days
Bro Rick rolled us with noteblocks 😂
NOOO RICK ROLL
Kaboom? Yes rico kabo...(nuke sounds)(undertale enemy death sound)
I will do 5000000000 pushups for every like this comment gets
I will do 5000000000 pushups for every like this comment gets
43:42  bro rickrolled the viewer's
Can you share the shell blueprint?
what happened to the pizza after the deliverer tapped the domino
Can we talk about how wunba made water breathing for a dolphin its a sea creature it breathes under water 😂
Btw the world record with tnt is 1.6m units but IT WAS IN CREATIVE SO I THINK U GOT A WORLD RECORD!!!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Bro the video of you collecting every block in minecraft got 50k likes where's the 24 hour version?
did i just got rickrolled when wunba was grabbing resources to build storage
What if you done something like this but underground so it would look normal on the outside but it's actually a GIANT cave that stretches like a million blocks
I love how when the tnt was exploding there was just a pig in a pond just living its best life 😅
bro this editor is on top
27:36 Good joke
that was genuinely such a cool video to watch. giant minecraft and real life rube goldburg machine breaking world records. You put so much work and passion into this video and it turned out so so cool thank you.
jort storm
i expanded the storage a Little bit" 💀🗿
10:02 man that was the best rickroll man i was as good as the video man keep up
HOPPERS
Just ordered one of the posters, super excited!! ❤ congrats man!
Im surprised your pc didnt explode with the tnt
2:40 bro really just screamed in lowercase
this was so good
I would pay tax dollars for this
Why the hell have i started humming Rick Astely???
i bet the pc was just like the atomic bomb and it did BOOM!
too long
bro took "take no chances" too seriously
bro this video is over half an hour long and every part is pure gold. you deserve all of our subs (insert heart emoji here)
bro really tried to rickroll us lol
i bet the pc was just like the atomic bomb and it did BOOM!
this is the best 1 million subs thanks ever.
10.10 did i just get rick rolld
Your gonna hate the crafter lol
Jeez, I swear to god...My Laptop had the same wallpaper of urs!!
i knew it was gonna be never gonna give you up lol
wha'ts the name of auto-crafting mod?
2017 ahh video
10.02 rickroll >:(
the totem is blinking???????
Definitely be sure to back up important files often. Storage can always fail, files can always corrupt, or any number of secret third things.
WHY DID YOU NEED TO RICK ROLL US WHY WUNBA WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY starts 10:02 - 10:15 (Its the orange words) AND THEN IT HAPPENENS FOR A SECOND TIME REALLY??? 44:05 - 44:27
No it was such a good video it got better with Rick roll
Imagine if he did all of that, just to die from drowning damage. Edit: Actually, nvm. He has a totem.
your nuke here is probably weaker than that amount of TNT would actually be because the amount that should be in one block should be enough to level a building... not the small explosion it is in game. You should ideally compare actual blast radius if you want a closer real life comparison.  Either way this is a crazy amount.
rename the video to specify you're in hardcore survival!!! so cool!
24:18 was honestly really heartwarming ❤️ 🌟   And to think that you started this at 1.057M subs and now at over 1.3M just show how much time you put into this, keep on the good work champ 👑
2:57 Oppenheimer reference
10:04 why u rickroll?
Did you live??
Wow that is epic😳😳😳
if you had rickrolled me i will unsubscribe you. or everyone who you had rickrolled in this video. you have done it even twice
In the second is bro faking his videos is there only 3 portals in every world
the fact that he had to say 3 day in "real life"🤣🤣🤣 18:46
Blud thinks he's sb737
When you were getting more gunpowderthe night and day cycle make a flashing like background
Oh, come on, I wanted to see your perspective on the blast.  Seems a little bit staged
If you know what that means can grants
What does his toad blink
That poor chicken xD
The poor chicken
NICEEEEEEE  UR SO DEDICATED  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK
Dolphins are actually mammals. It should not die
Step1. Get a nasa pc
bro. Ur INSANE! How ? u showed the hole process and i'm still like: HOW??? this is inbelievable
look at ornge words
bro said never ganna give you up in the storege building part
Dude I knew it was the rick-roll😅😊

Hopper😂
no showers were taken over the production of this video
Hai u forgot me
epic
I watch the 10:34 part at 10:34 EXACTLY
I never expected a Rick roll in this video😂
The Oppenheimer soundtrack made this so epic
Why did you say it like Openhiemer in 1965
yk u can a start a bussnise by building these survers and selling them btw dont sell this one never ever only for visiting (ik my spellings r bad)
For those wondering the lowest yield foe the us is 10-20 megatons
IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE 2196.15 KILOTONS NOT 2421 SO YEA STOP INSANELY EXAGGERATING AND LYING ABOUT THE “TRUE MAGNITUDE” OF THE TNT LOL MY CAPS LOCK KEY IS STUCK WHY AA BUT ITS 2196 KILOTONS IF ANYBODY WANTS TO KNOW THAT WUNBA IS LYING LOL WHY IS MY CAPS lock oh it fixed, BTW THE FIRST NUKE WAS ACTUALLY 25 KILOTONS SO ONCE AGAIN SHRINKING IT TO MAKE IT SEEM LARGER WOW HOW CLEVER LYING TO UR FANS (TRINITY IS THE NUKE NAME FOR PROOF THAT ITS 25 KILOTONS) AAAAAHAHAHAHAHhaam ehh ehh.
Bro rickrolled us twice in one video 💀
45:31 the pig why would you do this
For those wondering this is a very small nuclear bomb
Show us ur specs

I like the secret (☞ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)☞ 10:05
He is insane
Good vid but why tf would u not show what happened to the obby cube Or an pov in the cube🤨
THAT WAS THE SMARTEST RICKROLL EVER
When I don’t have motivation I will just watch this channel    (It motivates me)
the real thing begins at 45:24 but u shud definitely watch the whole vid
So glad you were able to recover your world. You should probably start doing backups now.

Lol the whole video was just si scripted lol
NO WAZ I JUST GOT MINEROLLED!
NO WAY JAN 13 IS MY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!
I guessed that the song would be rick roll just based on the litematica materials list that just goes to show how many times I have been rickrolled if I am able guess it based on the litematica materials list you showed for that particular section
'i built a nuke' us:☺ russia:😛 north korea:😃 iran:😁 israel:😊 uk:🙂 france:😉 germany:😏 everyone else: 💀
Castcrafter is the best
damn i just got mine-rolled
E
WE ALL  PREVIOUSLY KNEW THE LEGENDARY MUSIC RIGHT GUYS?
Wunba, if it's not a problem, would you have a video showing your PC's settings, I want to play without practically any lag problems, you know?
its so funny how many times he said hoppers after 9:50
bro rike roled us lol
Minnenheimer
Hats off for the dedication 🎩
he rickrolled us at 10:07
now oppenheimer is jealous
Rick roll
you would only need 625 tnt for this to be a real nuke worth of tnt
How often does he touch grass?
Wunba rickrolled everyone
44:06 CALLED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I did not watch the whole video yet, but i bet the song will be a rick roll.
You just richrold us
It’s crazy that humans have still made a bigger bomb
I thought you meant the tnt would make your pc a nuke
Are u survived
Why does us non youtubers say a mansion is hard to build but then😢
You could’ve uploaded the world before you exploded it to patreon and then after you blow it up upload that as a separate download
you're botting minecraft lol
Bro thinks he is Oppenheimer 💀
32:28 why is there pixels what are you blurring
you can craft it
Tbh, if you're trying to make an efficient explosion, then I would make it as flat as possible. So much tnt is wasted because it doesn't destroy anything.
Brothe Animations and quality is crazy
34:02 Joo, einfach Heiko xD
I dare you to touch grass and take a shower
Never gona give you up!
41:06 WHO'S THAT IN THE LEFT?
I haven't finished the video but i just know it is going to be a rick roll or something          (Edit) i god damn called it😂
I would've just dug a hole and put water in it to survive lol...
Did he die? Bro that was so fkng cool, please tell me you are still alive.
Did you die or survive, I am so curious
44:06 is best rickroll ever, No one expect that will happen 😂
bro rickroll'd us 2 times
I will do half a pushup every like I get
did bro just find a new way to rick roll 10:00
Give the new editor a raise he is cracked
You are mathematically a jerk
So we didnt even get to see what happened ? Lol anti climax. But still a cool video.
Me before reaching the end: "Oh god, a music player? I'm so going to get Rickrolled."   Me at 44:08:
bro just rickroll'd us in 10:03 - 10:14
16:52 meth
never gona give you up never gona let you down
Bro just Casually Rickrolled Us With Minecraft 😂😂
castcrafter😂
Select delete
To get off that screen actually just click Ctrl alt delete
Biggest Respect ! 💥🧨🧨TNT 🧨🧨💥 YOU ARE A LEGEND
bro went to real life to touch grass💀💀💀💀 jokes aside that was cool tho
2:43 help him
how did you make an auto crafter are you in a prerealease
Keep the editor bro, great work
I like the part where it was mathematically accurate
what a world we live in... dude needed to censor his feet
Are you dead bro?
everyone saw that rickroll miles away
He rickrolled us, also can it the netherice thingy
Wunba , just a masterpiece 🎉🎉 what a video . Animation top notch, editing on another level determination and hardwork on just out of the world . One of the best Minecraft I have ever seen.
Last Vid
Never gonna give you up 😂😂😂
Hey I saw the totem blink
bro just placed a bunch of tnt in and made it overly dramatic
just got rick rolled in minecraft note block...
4:03-4:05 Did your totem just blink!?!
You used the wrong key for rick astley it was too high pitch !!!
yay boom he didnt die wooooooooo seriously this is insane and helped my mental health thanks
.@Wunba Minecraft World Stories Channel in Year Tuesday February 13,2024.😐.
This is the first video I have ever watch and I was blown away from how talented you are so keep ya good work up man:D
i will build the hearted game in my minecraft build map
Wait a minute i was in your stream when you were placing the tnt in it
Did anyone else notice the rick roll
"Never gonna give you up" Is the secret phrase
16:31 yo, what is that poster for in the far right? is that for some shrek non canon spin-off??
at around 10 mins in he rickrolls us
thats the equivalent of 43.33333333 tsar bombas
For the best part go to 44:06
Rip chicken😢
We just got rickrolled in 2024
great
that was so good
Wunba I really appreciate on how you did this. it is so amazing!!
He have become death destroyer of worlds
I love every part of this video please keep up the hard work and dedication!
0:07 Ehh I don't know, that's pretty average..
why am I crying right now
He has now become death and destroyer of PCs
How fun, my computer did that two days ago
hope you dont get taken down
😮
Wow
Jason Lee aka the pizza guy is waiting outside for 3 hours to knock out the dominos
I no way that mf did a backflip for celebration😂😂 6:17
not only did this man make a bomb in Minecraft he made one IRL (AKA your computer)
It's amazing to make not only a giant TNT, but also a fuse gimmick, dominoes, and explosions!
there's no way... how do you not keep a backup when you have more than a million subs because of the files on said drive and other "important files"  And no way you can forget about uploading it for more than a day   Sorry, I'll go now
I fucking love you vids gosh
why did bro need that protection i would just put my self in a 3x3 obsidian box and chill
Bro why tf is there so much math 😭😭😭
10/10 video as always <3
Wel wumba, you now have 1.15 million subscribers, whens the new nuke going to be built?
You Rick rolled us
I’ve done this irl so this isn’t that impressive ngl
People who known about the totem of undying blinked 👇
bro rickrolled me 😐😐😐
The ‘hoppers’ part at 9:53 made me laugh
😡you had to make the song never gonna give you up
When it explodes.Wunba's POV:   https://content.instructables.com/FDU/994J/JN4V9GGD/FDU994JJN4V9GGD.jpg?auto=webp CLICK LEAVE IS NOT CLICKBAIT!
10:03 casual Rick roll surprised I noticed it
You didn't show us whether you survived or not whyyy I was looking forward to that part lol you hyped it up so much then no news about it at all at the end lol
this is the most effort that has gone into a rick roll ever. it's amazing.
Oh noo the rick roll 44:12😅😅
41:08 bruh my computer so laggy that this happens all the time
broooo not the hidden rick roll 😂
I'm going to make your a copy of your discord server and let the only twist is that is going to be a flat world and everybody will be in creative
Actually this was 2 days before I commented
I like how dedicated you are and how far you would go just to say thanks to us even if subscribe ing is just a click of a button and you made a song in Minecraft that took probably hours just to rick roll us
Loved the rickroll 😉
Just beacause of the nuke. And the rickrolling us and yourself.... you just gained another subscriber to add to your millionth! You deserve it!! Keep up the good work
minecraft but terrorism
seriously, you had to 10 minutes through
26:48 when the Limitless theme kicks in:
I really wanted the music part to play "the final countdown"
jamie?
japanese people during ww2 be like
Wunba is just one of those people that love to use hundreds of hours just to entertain everyone and for pure happiness and satisfaction :D Edit: So did you survive????????!!!!!!!!
No aftermath in the daylight???? 40min video and the aftermath is dim and a minute long??
13:40. It is a common misconception that a minecraft tnt block contains 1,650 kg of tnt.  A minecraft tnt block only contains 412.5 kilograms of tnt, assuming trinitrotoluene is the explosive material.   Let me explain:  In minecraft, a block of tnt is 16 pixels in all 3 dimensions, X, Y, and Z.  If we look at the top of the tnt block, we can see 16 individual tubes filled with explosives, they grey material. The red material is simply the packaging.  There are 100 centimetres in a metre. 1 minecraft block is 1 cubic metre. Each tube of actual explosives is only 2 pixels wide.   100 / 16 = 6.25cm.  1 pixel is 6.25 cm wide.  Finding the top surface area for one explosive tube:  2 x 6.25 = 12.5 12.5^2 = 156.25 cm^2.  Now, lets find the volume of one explosive tube, assuming they run the full height of the block, which is one metre:  100 x 156.25 = 15,625 cm^3.  Now, we get the volume for all 16 tubes.  16 x 15,625 = 250,000 cm^3  Now that we have the volume for all of the tubes, we can calculate the ACTUAL mass of all of the TNT in one minecraft block.   the density of TNT is 1.65 g/cm^3 1.65 x 250,000 = 412,500 grams of tnt. 412,500 / 1000 = 412.5 kilograms of tnt.  Now, what was the actual yield of all of the tnt in the video?  In the video, he states that the yield is 2,421 KT of tnt. We now know this to be false.  There are 1,372,032 blocks of tnt. We multiply this by the mass of tnt in one block, in tonnes.   1,372,032 x 0.4125 = 565,963.2 tonnes. 565,963.2 tonnes = 565.9632 kilotonnes  All of the tnt in the pile is actually only about 566 kilotonnes.   For context, the largest pure fission weapon tested by the USA was Ivy King, which had a yield of 500KT, 66 KT less powerful than the tnt pile created in this video. The largest nuclear bomb, the Tsar Bomb (which was thermonuclear), had a yield of 50 Megatonnes, aka 50,000 KT.   For anyone who got this far, sorry if I gave you a headache.
Wunba, from the "Fake Holy Cow Association", you have won the grand prize
never gonha give you up never gonha give you up never gonha let you down
I can't believe this video only got 500000 thousand views
ngl I almost left the video and unsubscribed as soon as I heard the song but then I realized all the hard work and stayed on. Lol love your videos Wunba.
2:06 - 2:34 are you playing Jort Storm????
The question is: did your harcore world survive after that?
it would be sick to have seen some tnt minecarts in there, could even be automated
Create players watching these kinds of videos knowing every way they’d automate and simplify these kinds of mass projects
The dedication is crazy
10:02 I got Rick rolled
All I want to know is, did he survive? cause he never said!!!
Honestly if I had lost my hardcore world like that, I would've ended my hardcore run irl. But this is legitimately the most impressive thing I've ever seen in my life
Never Gonna Give You Up... wow
I suppose we’ll know why Wunba will have arthritis in a few years
tatical nuke incoming "Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt sun tzu the art of war. whatever you do don't reveal all your technics In a youtube video you fool you moron - technoblade joking in potato war."
I knew I was gonna get rickrolled
Pewdiepie in the background: Incredible Job!
so... did you survive? XD
Rip bros alt account 💀🫡
7:56 bro is so rich he blocks out lava with emerald blocks...
that was insane
Wait guys, I didn’t understand did he die or no?
dasts a loota gravi trax
Bro became Robert J Oppenheimer.
Hiroshima
what are the 3 moves you watched when crafting the tnt
wait so instead of limiting the power that mbo gives to the ssd you just bought a new one instead? That's a *power* move
Nah that not a boat tower thats the boatem pole 30:46
New it will be a rickroll
Nice rickrolling skills, u actually got me there
If that guy hadn’t reminded you you had a world download, wumba would be gone
be in createv
didnt even show off the devastation left in its wake common man
OH MY GOD???  From the clips of your old dominoes channel, I'm pretty certain I used to watch some of your videos! I too used to love chain reactions and it was all I watched on youtube. I'm not sure it was your videos, but it'd be awesome if it was!
How did I know you were going to play that song
I had the same thing happen to me with my build it 1.1 world and really killed my mood for minecraft and that was 2 years ago.
This was frickin amazing to watch and all the time and effort put into creating this video. Get this guy to 2 million already!!! AMAZING work Wunba!! Much love, u js gained urself a new permanent subscriber
holy smokes
he just asmr rick rolled us
He Rick rolled  Us😂😂😂😂😂
I was going to cry😥 if you lost your hardcore world and your PC I'm so happy that you did not lose it😃
This guy puts way too much effort into this, taking hours at a time for tasks that I would have quit on at about 10 minutes. You earned a sub from me dude :]
Imagine just being a village and seeing somone creat this massive nuke for months and getting vaporised instantly
Your dedication is crazy!
That chicken has faced the most suffering death in Minecraft
He really went and said “go big or go home”
Wow. Just wow. AMAZING AMAZING, THE LAND OF 10,000 AMAZING'S
rip memory card
30:52 BOATEM POLE!
New edit is beautiful i love it
sharkblown up 1 billion tnt blocks thou
44:06 bro wtf??? 😭
You only need approximately 12725 blocks of tnt for a nuke, one million is waaay more than that
beo is back to his origin 💀💀
I don't poop on a regular basis.
The video starts at 37:24 mute it and play music in the background
"random bullshit go"
10:20 - I got a new editor...
10:02 - water, slabs, sticky pistons, shulkers, pistons, NEVER, dispensers, redstone blocks, GONNA... Continues on to Rick Roll us in 2024
One of the most incredible things I’ve ever seen in the game. Love the story of your old domino passion and how it came into play for this whole video
That music sounded familer
I want you to know, if this was a real nuke with the same yield as the amount of TNT you exploded, then, in minecraft units, it would have made a mushroom cloud OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND blocks tall, and at least 15 to 18 thousand blocks wide. I'm not making this up. I did the math and compared it to some British nuclear tests in the 50's that had a pretty similar yield of around 3 megatons.  Imagine what a circle 18,000 blocks across looks like in Minecraft. All of that would be covered by the mushroom cloud from this thing.  Edit: this is low-balling it, btw. There have been slightly smaller nukes that have made mushroom clouds over 20km tall. The particular circumstances of the detonation can make a large difference.
But did you survive????
32:36 Bro literally censored his feet instead putting on some dang socks. Legend.  EDIT: I just realized I didn't put the right timestamp in 😅Thanks for those who noticed; I fixed it now.
imagine this video but unedited 😭🫥
22:10 you DID say that 😂
Rick roll was cheeky.
The Chicken 🫡🫡🫡 👇
Bro did ALL the mining, processing, built the factory and storage for tha NUKKEEE
JUST IN CASE!!!!!! delete hardcore world and remove tnt.
9:56  and one more thing the hoppers
who is holding you captive
Dude rickrolled us and thought we wouldn't notice. :) Twice.
45:19 that chicken ded tho
"Release the cup, and then the cup releases the marble, which releases THE TOILET PAPER!!!!"
1 push up every reply hope I don’t regret this
🔥
You rickrolled me..
13:28 For those of you interested, the yield of that massive TNT creation is the same as the Soviet R-12 medium-range nuclear missile, the same missiles deployed by the Soviets during the Cuban Missile Crisis.
Tsar bomba was i believe 100...MegaTons
I new it from the beginning:  44:06
what is the wunba's modpack?
Man the poor chicken wo did kamikaze to start the explosion
"it took me five  hours 😢" Literally any hardcore skyblock player: 😏
the mr beast of minecraft worls
umm if a tnt broke into your totem dispensing machine it wouldve blown up the totem dispenser so no you would not be safe but  COLDD DETERMINATION AND VIDEO
How did he just drop 2000 levels at 4:35?
2:55 was that a fucking Lil darkie reference
Wtf 😭you're so adorable holy hell you sounded so happy during the whole video. I'm so glad to find your videos. New sub fr
Pls tell me which autoclicker you used, it's soooo fast!
Bro really rickrolled us at 10:04
yo ima be honest but this guy is the mr.beast of minecraft challenges
Did anyone else notice the rickroll at around 10:00 (during the time lapse), also its really impressive, the amont of effort and time that went into this video.
I WATCH YOUR OLD VID OMG THAT WAS YOU!?!?!?!?
‏‪3:28 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
congratulations wunba! you deserved 1M. also tnt blows up at 44:06
DUDE! Get yourself a PC with a RAID 1 config to ensure such stuff never happens!
There was one mint about acsauly exploding the tnt and nothing else.
Boom boom
Also that was a big tnt but I have a feeling I could beat it, I cannot record it though(i would also be in survival)
i called that the song was never gonna give u up
bro is on creative at this point
imagane loosing an end game hardcore world bc you drowned
8 double chests filled with shulker boxes filled with gunpowder
You definitely deserve a lot more, your work is so hard, and results impresses as fuck
Really enjoyed this and the new editing style, thank you!
did he die?
What a video really enjoyed ❤❤
Losing all of your important files is so sad
This video is actually insane it inspired almost all of us.
You blurred your feet. That means you’re either hurt or you were born with six toes.
HE RICK ROLLED US TWICE XD
I want to see the footage of him inside the obsidian cube!
sooooo, did he die?
tnt gives fallout?
Wow wtf
I do the same thing but on my phone (IT cannot withstand 1000000 TNT:(
23:01 im sorry, this is easy?
this reminds me of like peak 2016 minecraft content just a dude making videos and having fun while doing so
9:47 was so funny cuz he said hoppers 6 times 😅
With tweakaroo you couldve just extended to block reach to 8 and been able to sprint while stacking 5 high
13:45 bro this me placing 2 tnt blocks my computer can't handle anything 💀💀💀
Did he die at the end??
Am I the only one who noticed him say, never gonna give you up?
we got rickrolled good at 10:00.
Not all comments need to be long so all I’ve got to say is: Well done on everything.
Yep, glad I skipped to the end so I didn't have to watch this terrible video.
For every like I get I will take one breath
Your pc became the actual atomic bomb
AND THE PC MAKE A COMBACK LETS GOOOOO
never gona let you down
I like how we don't know if he survived or not. Very Schroodinger's Cat.
10:05 had to be foreshadowing for 44:07
mal
the way bro didnt even try to put in world edit to get the tnt blocks done in 2 mins instead of 3 days
can you share the totem s texture pack?
ive got rickrolled lol
Bro, it says that the video is 2 days old, but the record is set on 13 january. ITS F###ING 12 JANUARY
Fun fact: This *thing* has the power of 2.2 megatons of TNT.   TNT has a density of 1.65g/cm3. Since each Minecraft block is 1m3, each block has 1650000g, or 1.65 tons of TNT. He has used 1331000 blocks, multiplying this together results in an explosion force of roughly 2.2 megatons.  Edit: Didn’t finish the video before commenting, but here’s the math.
Wumba is the only one I can agree with him to use mods in hardcore. its just to much time
bye chicken
What are the poor kids growing up to, what a sad time we live in..
Bro this is the best minecraft video on youtube
that's worth a sub
this edit was insane congrats!!!
if you are duping sand, would it not just be more efficient to dupe shulker boxes of tnt?
@castcrafter
bro just dropped the hardest oppenhimer edit and thought we wouldn't notice?
people  ALWAYS DO BACKUPS
@Wunba Did you survive?!!
26:30 Which is why... I added doors... *confetti* 🤣
Bro rickrolled us all😂
I called it on the music box
Around 2.3 Megatons. Definitely a city killer.
Umm...  you forgot to tell us if you survived the explosion XDDD
"The most amount of tnt in a hardcore world" good call there if u didnt sat in harcore my tnt maniac creativ mode kid would beat in secondes
Cast gut gemach
what auto clicker do you use
Que estúpidos videos te devian de investigar el FBI y meterte en la cárcel
nice
Bruh CastCrafter is my fav YouTuber and I didn't know that he had the WR before 34:00
Did anyone get the rickroll in the sand storage building part??
he could have just hidden the bottom face but he decided to show it. what a pure soul
20:55 shout out AGST - Look. Best royalty-free song of all time!
13:51 my brain died.😊
Sick ass vid
W engineer (the first time)
Hoppers
Lol, the wonders of youtube...
Wunba, congrats on 1mil subscribers!!! That nuke was epic! I always love destruction in minecraft! Surviving that is even more epic!!!
Those who noticed NGGYU(Never Gonna Give You Up) on 10:05 👇
I wish i could sub to every time
hey, anybody notice the rickroll at 10:05?
so that is 1.95MT of TNT
Give me your new pc build stats so I can build that bad boy
This video shows the importance of having backups.
DId anyone evlse here the rick roll
How do I get your poster. I really want to play Minecraft with you.🎉
Why u did that :( (bigga rick rolled us)
Wait! 46 minutes to basically not seeing the explosion and the aftermath?
Why don't you create a custom totem
he forgot the pizza ;(
10:13 , the never gonne give you up was veeeeeery unexpected xD
you rickrolled us!
Broo he's having shit enchantments on his armour
I love this editor
Minecraft youtubers either dieth the most stupidest way ever or by a literal nuketh

Did you really Rick Roll us in your video? LOL.
The moment you realise death stranding is not a bad game
Why did you rick roll us
aint no way i just got rickrolled in material gathering section 😭 edit: double rick roll holyy
Bro Rickrolled me while he was whispering😂😂
good job, you played yourself. why would u explode all of ur hard work and 300 dollars
8:15 why did the totem blink?
no way he just rickrolled us
that's crazzzyyyy you are crazzzyyyy
Why is this video so well made
This video is insane. Well done bro.
feet!?
if you are doing those things, you can use macro, there you will stand in the corner, install macro, tipe to the macro how big is the cube and it will start doing things, you can chill its like bot
fact: tnt cant dealing damage more than 8 block so if u in the middle of an any block box covered in liquid and its 17x17x17. u will survived without any tick of damage taken
You rick rolled everyone.
25:04 "I had not lost this old creative part of me, it just changed form" Powerful shit man. It's something I feel very deeply. Keep up the great work.
Didnt mrbeast have the largest explosion
wow this is the most effort ive seen someone put into a 1000000 subs celebration. i am speechless
At the 10th minute when you were collecting items you RickRolled us  10:05  never 10:07  gonna 10:09  give 10:11  you 10:13  up
Did he eat the pizza?
I knew it😂😂😂
nice work!
I saw your message in the video.
👍👍🤫🤫
I watched your dominoes channel, I didn't know it was really you
SO THE DOMINOES CHANNEL WAS YOURS??
Who else knew the music Box made the rickroll
Well, guess what! I am currently trying to beat the record in Minecraft. I am following a pattern that so far goes like this...  1 TNT 2 TNT 4 TNT 8 TNT 16 TNT 32 TNT 64 TNT 128 TNT 256 TNT 512 TNT 1.024K TNT 2.048K TNT 4.096K TNT 8.192K TNT 16.384K TNT 32.768K TNT 64.536K TNT 131.072K TNT and now, I am currently about 10% finished with the 262.144K TNT Cube.  I DID use some commands and did it all in creative mode on a Minecraft Superflat World, but over the past day and a half, with the use of Creative Mode and Commands, I've so far completed the cubes I listed above. My main goal is to reach the most TNT ever detonated within Minecraft History even with the use of Creative Mode and Commands. But, still, this video is ABSURDLY Eye Catching and Awe-Inspiring! I find it fascinating just how determined and successful you have always been when it has come to Absurdly ENORMOUS Minecraft Projects, Plans, Creations, Ideas, and More Eye-Catching Thoughts of Imagination you have provided everyone Subscribed and even not Subscribed to your YouTube Channel over the past 6-7 Years AND I now understand, that, from my understanding of what you mentioned about Dominos in this YouTube MONSTROSITY, that, even before this YouTube Channel, before 2016, I think you showed in your video, you had already started another YouTube Channel, entirely for INCREDIBLE Domino Creations you once built for fun. But, at least, from MY understanding, you had made some pretty amazing Domino Chain Reactions before, and, one day, you just didn't feel like you liked making anything else with the use of Dominos, so, you started a second YouTube Channel (This Current one), purely related to Minecraft. Whatever, the reality may be, I would just like you to know, that, you are AMAZING! Keep it up, bro! NEVER give up! :) Call me "Impressed."
Keep up the good work you entertain us so so much
Holy shit so much effort in only one Video! Sadly I can like the video once
it ittitates me that dis guy doesnt just say 2,4 megatons
Nah bro rickrolled us
that chicken sacrificed its self what a chad
Nice rick roll😂
Well kinda anti climatic........
Hoppers, hopper- hoppers- hoppers- ho-maniacal whispering
So... You could replace all this huge warehouse with minecarts with chests, since you can put more than one on top of the rail and put everything on top of funnels for a simple double chest underneath but there's also the issue of the time it would take to fill up again... So, here's the tip
Almost dies him:ok
ok this is all great and stuff, but... did you survive?
Bro actually did the rickroll on us 😂
that was WAy too close to drowning, imagine that was how this world ended lol
Never gonna give you up🤣🤣🤣 10:13
That was a MASTERPIECE of a rick roll
bro made a 2.4 Megaton tnt
love the new editor, like it better than before!
I have one thing to say: DAYYUUUM
make a backup for your sever on a 2nd ssd
no PC
Pizza man still waiting
It's funny how I knew that the song being played by the reaction would be Never gonna give you up, it was just so obvious for me lmao. Anyways, this was incredible , keep up the amazing work!
More powerfull than the Tsar Bomb?
More powerfull than the Tsar Bomb?
hoppers, hoppers, hoppers, then hoppers, more hoppers, and hoppers
10:10 bro rlly just rickrolled me...
did kingsammelot edit this part 10:21 haha
the rickroll at 10:07 timelapse when he got some items 😅
.    .    . That's Oppenheimer's song? Think it's pretty fitting. Wumba a couple of minutes after: Now I became death, the destroyer of mineceaft worlds.
29:51 how did he get a 64 stack 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
33:10 Me: its Rick Astley isnt it  Edit: I CALLED IT
30:13 this is a reminder about your SATs
wait is this enough tnt to get all the netherite in the nether?
why in 37:33 chat is blurred?
exploding tnt would be proud
What is your fov

10:00
You Rick rolled us
🤓
This is a random comand
Never gonna give you up

@castcrafter
there's something that feels nostalgia about the giant tnt
@CastCrafter
i wish minecraft had plutonium :(
I think a lot of your fans are older than 16 so nostalgia for all those mascots SLAP except for COUNT 🤮
Bro Rick rolled us while reading out the ingredients
fun fact: the largest modern nuke by the name of tsar bomba is like 50,000 kilotons, so thats terrifying
like technooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo       you are the bestssssssssssssssssssssssss
44:02 you did  NOT
did the deliver man wait for you to pick up the pizza???
we do a bit of trolling the troll:
RIP minecart chicken
How is that make re powerful then a nuke? also ill support you in anyway cuz its stronger then a nuke I hope this comment gets 69 likes and 69 comments and dislikes
50 hours you say? Call in mrbeast
Do you still have the Kingsammelot Playbutton?
6:16 IS THAT KINGSAMMELOT BACKFLIPPING IN A WUNBA VIDEO??
This was one of the best 1 mio subscriber special I've ever seen in a very long time! I can not put into words how excited I was watching this video! This is pure insanity in the best and craziest way possible xD  Such a great special! ♥ Well deserved 1 mio subscriber! ♥🎉
I've never seen something crazier.. thank god everything went well at the end!
Dudeeee... you literally rickrolled us during the most serious timeeee . But the bombing was the most epic thing i've ever seen in my whole life. thanks for making this and congrats for 1 mil subs
insane
did you die in the world?
never expected to get rick rolled in these kind of videos
wow
18:38 i have an extremly similar issue and it happen when i update my nvidia driviers idk why it does that but i think it's my graphic card and proccessor that are non-compatible
This is hardly a hardcore world when you just Creative build everything..
Did your minecraft hardcore world survive? Please say yes! 😰
Bro why there is 2 hardcore world
this guy loved agario and also made chain reactions? he is literally me
This is insane 😮
mathematically accurate nukes are really tiny, so this is very wrong
No tip?:(:(
After watching all of his redstone machinery, automated farms, programming, calculations, and efforts, I shudder to think how disastrous he would have been as an engineer！
how did he get 150,000 subs in one day o.o
i like the never gonna give you up meme lol
Bro so much dedication for an hour and a half of absolute beauty!❤ keep it up!
R.I.P chicken
“never gonna give you up”😂😂
Bro, the secret song (in the noteblock) and in my mind i said this "this would be the rickroll" then it WAS
the rickroll at 10:22 was smooth anyone else notice it?  (yellow writing) 👇
did you survive it?
idk why my pc is shaking while im watching this vid!?
In the end, he formed a new biome, the Pillar Plains
I have never seen a totem blink like it did at 4:00
That was a creative and fun watch X3 You got my subscribe!
What is up with this guy and dirt platforms
cast crafter auf die 1
Fette bälle
Wunba, make the upgraded version of an Ancient City.    Edit: Actually, build all of Fontaine. All 7 current regions.   Edit 2: Build an entire lake Fontainian style.
I propose that for 10million subscribers Wumba should make a TNT blast with the same power as The Tsar Bomb
what was the autoclicker that you wer using?
that secret rickroll was veeery creepy
Never back down Never what...  Neva gana give u up
This video deserves a billion views... love from Hiroshima 🫶🏻
Petition for a monument of that brave chicken who sacrificed his life for the bomb 👇
Absolutly Amuzing Bro!
That was a big tsar boom
THE JORT STORM MUSIC!!!
Why are you copying castcrafters project 🫠
I really want to know if you survived
um uhh i don't know what to say  so well yeah, gg
2:53 you're*
20:20  LAVA DA GOAT
Could you upload the full 90 minute explosion
Bro Rick Rolled us LOL

Hopper
i didnt get rickrolled because i watched the stream
Minecraft players need to touch grass
1:21 🙂reveal i think i dunno
kid wunba : i stack dominoes to watch it fall for short moment of ecstasy now wunba : i built a canonnically accurate nuke and a set of phases as the fuse and then explode it in minecraft for shot moment of ecstasy future wunba : i built a nuke and used mines as the fuse in a format of dominoes
The most elaborate Rick Roll I've ever seen, and yet no one saw it coming
Such a nice video Own a sub
34:05 LOL CASTCRAFTER AM START AUF CRAFTATTACK
I love ur videos man! They fr cheer me up. I love the builds and all the work you do for the builds. Keep up the good work man!
9:58 Rick roll warning
It was my b day on January 13
1.15 mil
Water breathing for dolphins YOU DIDNT HAVE TO CUT ME OFF
Well I'm impressed.
the way he said *nevergonnagiveyouup*
Was it just me or did some of the background music sound like jort storm
Never gonna give you up 10:10 😂
44:04 NO WE GOT RICKROLLED! XD
U spend so much time for ur videos hatts off to u bro ❤❤🎉
Oppenheimer lore:     ( 17:16 extratone jumpscare )  Ok holy shit dude this was insane-
wait. wait. wait. DID U DIE OR NOT???
dude i used to watch domino videos all the time!! your videos look familiar but i’m not 100% on that
okayyy but did you take any damage?!?!
Pretty sure 90% of people beat you in their first destruction of a village in creative
im surprised his pc was still alive after all that
I'm new to your channel so, I don't know about your old editor but, this one is really good.
It is like an illusion or sum thing he as he looses his hard cor world
Imagine if Jason was watching 90 mins of destruction...
My man really said "legalize nuclear bombs" 😭
boomboom:>
I built a regular item sorter and i hate seeing hoppers and chests a little more i can only imagine how you feel
Your own life is just a cycle of patience and reward.  It may have been pointless, but still least you experienced something new but familiar.  S feeling of nostalgia but more personal.  A feeling of reliving a childhood.  Honestly, you're lucky to be how you are.  You are a great patient and optimistic. Congrats and thank you for existing.
Hiroshima bombing
I have a new appreciation for Minecraft players because i can’t last more than 15 minutes in the nether I’m almost never prepared enough
sorry man but you are annoying as hell stop being so corny lmao
Bro wanna say hi?🤔😐
could you please add epilepsy warnings on the time lapses?
I hope jason somehow sees this lol
Love from  India 🇮🇳
bros world always gets fucked up on these videos
What sand farm are you using
❤
10:00 never gonna give u up lol
POV his fbi agent watching this: 😳
Once again, amazing video. Congratulations on the new editor, I loved your editing in previous videos, but I did notice a change in the editing in this video. It was even better. Love the ways you edit your videos, you deserve a lot more than a million subs.
back in 2014 we did a huge one whole server was community based and was an active town but we got raided
32:37 why does he censor his feet?
What monster of an autoclicker are you using dude
Use tnt mine carts it is more accurate
No way it's you wunba 24:37
How to crash your pc: Step 1. Place 1.3M tnt in minecraft
How many times did he say hoppers in 9:42
wow wumba, you went through so much for this video and I applaud you for it. you totally deserve all the success coming your way.  congrats on 1 million and hope you get to 10 million soon! 💕🫂
Did bro survive?
New viddddd!!!!!!!!!!!!!
not the never gonna give you up
Waiting for his computer to explode too
nice
imagine if a skeleton with a flame bow shot the tnt mid project
i actually i loved this video the chain was insane
hopefully u survived it so u r able to play it again
its crazy his pc could handle the explosion so well without crashing
Holy smokes this video was incredible, keep up the good work
rip the old editor
those who knew he was going to rick roll us 👇
13:52 the walls were so perfect, thought u were really close to placed tnt lol
Wunba, ever considered creating a new series where you build a bunch of the stuff you always do, yk, as a spectacle as it is, but instead of having to do the grind yourself, youre allowed to hire people to do these tasks for you? Would definitely help your upload schedule and I dont rly think that the viewers wouldnt like, assured youd be transparent about it. Dk man, you just have so much potential
24:16
Someone been studying MtBeast and it looks gorgeous
OOF. I knew immediately when you showed the BIOS page that it was a storage drive failure, bc the same thing happened to me just a few months ago. They were able to salvage all the data off my secondary drive, but nothing off my primary/boot drive, so I also lost all my minecraft worlds :( At least I had my resource pack backed up
the most insane minecraft player i know of tbh
"Huh, I wonder if Wunba has uploaded latel– holy shit."
Been watching these live streams! So excited for the vid
rick rolled
9:50 and 10:00 Best time stamps
36:30 WAY better a video than i thought   No wayyyyy bro
I have a build idea, build every frame of never gonna give you up in Minecraft for a April fools or late April fools joke.
13:46 your pc will BECOME the nuke when you ignite the tnt.
27:08 DOMINOS  HOLY SHIT FORESHADOWING
big nuke
25:00 why am i shaking
11:41 just a “””””little””””” bit
16:45 NOOOOOO LUDA
Alternative title: How I lost my hardcore world twice!
That was awesome I always love watching your videos
Das a lot of tnt
0:41 im high
This was better then Oppenheimer
wait this was a world record..?
why dont you back up your important data?
He Rick rolled us
41:47 guys let’s storm his house
In the "building the farlands" how did he keep the ender pearl stases rendered? Did he have a friend stay at the chamber to keep it rendered?
That was my favorite rickroll ever. Amazing job on the vid :))
Did he survive or not?
Terracraft when?
got rickrolled near the end
Never gonna what? 10:04
Did you survive?
Is there a mod that messes with the appearance of night and day so that the rapid cycling is less flashy?
scientifically accurate?
2:55 bro thinks hes oppenheimer
Ur PC is about to be 100x sronger than the first nuclear bomb
i loved that that explosion
Blud secretly Rick rolled us, twice
what was the old channel name with the dominoes?
If this build is actually 130x times more powerful than the trinity bomb, which is only 2 kilotons, then this build is 260 kilotons, which is not really that strong. This is assuming if what you said is correct.
What autoclicker do you use?
Did he die?
Congrats on the subscribers, hope you’re non-Minecraft related personal files ended up okay!
Please tell me you were valedictorian
No backup no mercy. If you have important data depending on the importance you have 2-4 instances where you save it regularly
Wumba rickrrolled all of his fans. Good job! :) BTW I expcted that.
His PC didn't die when exploding the TNT, IT DID WHILE PLACING IT.
🎉😊❤
Master really got em workin 💀
This is one perfect video, great editing, script and a LOT, but a LOT of effort put into it  keep it up Wunba!!
I remember watching one of ur streams where u werent allowed to say nuclear and asking myself when u were going to build this. Love your vids and streams❤️
His computer deleted his world when he was playing the game normally and then he still thought “yeah I think setting off 1 million tnt would be a pretty good idea”
2:00 Wunba causally be like "I think if we get 143 beacons this'll be a lot faster
Huh, I didn’t even know CastCrafter had the record
Knowing Walker personally, he puts in so much work day in and day out on these projects, huge props to him and this incredible video he put together!
Man i want a tutorial on how to make never gonna give you up with the note blocks
ok but did he survived ?
That bomb was very bomb
is he dead
why not use turtle helmet instead of all those conduits
The dedication that went into this video is nuts. Great work Wunba ❤
Wish you used the Oppenheimer theme song
When you get bored in Minecraft...
44:07 GET RICKROLLED NERDS!!! (btw i got rickrolled too 😢)
I feel sorry for the amount of grinding that went into this, NICE JOB  😎
i hope you don't die
What a great video I couldn’t stop having a big smile on my face while you pushed the first domino to start it.!
Did someone notice that the thumbnail changed from iron tool to diamond
Dude you are insane. Not joking you are literally insane. I doubt you actually exist.
how do u not get bored bru
Omg i didnt't know Cast held the record Thats rlly cool (Btw the video is amazing :))) )
20:00 thats why you make 1 backup, locally, one backup in an external drive and and a cloud backup in whenever place you use.
I actually like it that you  dont upload so fast like others. Because we know that your videos arent fake :)
People that forgot what he was making
Did the world survived?
GG ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
i will do 1 comment for every push-up this like gets!
This is so interesting!
Adding this to my watchlist!
WUNBA STOP USING GOOGLE!1!!1!1!1!1!1 USE OPERA GX!1!1!1!1!1!1
rickrolled us twice in one video 💀
10:02 u didnot just rickroll me like that bro
If that bomb was irl it would've destroyed all life on earth and most likely all of earth in general. For example 100 killotons of tnt could destroy the earth, and the strongest bomb ever was 50 kt
when you get the american megatrends screen you press F1 then click troubleshoot launchers and try which one works for you, i dont think anything with the storage was wrong.
10:03 orange text is a Rick roll
tsar bomba was more
W
But did you died
2:43  we need to help him, he is being held captive, hold strong my friend
That thing with the pizza is SO DAMN SMART
10:15 bro just Rick rolled   Saying *never give up*
He was ready to go out with a bang
The only thing that would be better than it is if you explode 100,000 tnt for every video that you have made on the series
Armor with maxout explosion protection would be enough
can iget yoiur old motherboard pls
37:33 loved the video but what was blurred out in the bottom left hand side where the chat usually is?
What's wunbas pc stats?
I dont even know how to express how great this video is By minute 20 youve already had me interested so so so much i couldnt help but feel so much emotion throughout these 26 minutes so far so basically youre great and good job Your creativity is amazing, literally   10/10 high w this playing
Bro really rick rolled us?
@wunba make the Fortnite island
before I finish the video, I want to say What if igniting the TNT causes your pc to become the irl world record nuclear bomb
No way he tried to tick roll us twice. He got me the first time but as soon as I saw the jukebox I knew he would try to rickroll
DIRT PLATFORM 😆
not worth the wait watching fr, unsubbing
That was SUPER cool, but, did he survive?
Im sorry for you're loss
fun fact he rickrolled us twice
Hey I'm thinking every time I see one of these videos with Shuler box try putting Shulker boxes in another one until it's full takes less space
That pizza Man was probably extremely confused 😂
13:43 nuCLEAR
The way bro blurred out his feet😂
does anyone know, what program he is using for the animations and everything ?
When he said the song would be revealed when it was time, i was thinking to myself it was gonna be a rickroll  Needless to say, i am surprised
Bro can't go 30 munites without Rickrolling us 💀Love u Wunba
love how you play the jort storm music lol
The dedication this man gives us
44:12 YOU SON OF A BI- *echo spreads because we all just got rickrolled
Hopper hopper hopper and hopper
The words in orange he said while collectinh the materials for the storage said: never gonna give u up
I can never understand why youtubers dont have backups for their worlds. Like, I've got RAID 5 on my PC with cloud storage on important files, and I only use it for buisness files, tax shit, and all muh video games.   I'm angry when youtubers lose their worlds or save files or footage because a single backup or cloud storage could have saved it. Google accounts come with 15gbs of free storage, and you can download the drive app and have auto backups. Use it on your minecraft world.   Also, you can get insurance for your minecraft world, by the way. You should.
bro became oppenheimer 2.0
Cher wombat im frensh in frensh hôpital IS free sorry m'y english
Nice Editor lol
Rip detonation chicken
HOW DID I GESS IT WAS A RICKROLL WHEN HE WAS BILDING IT!
I have a gordians knot
44:15 got me😂
never gonna give you up
Best video I've ever seen, thanks, Wunba  -Skull
Ive got gravi trax
i love chain reactions
You should’ve been extra save and worn full blast prot. Armor
do you still have king sammelots pöaybutton??
Get a pc with five fans instead of one maybe that would work better
bro rickrolled us
This is easily the best minecraft video ive ever seen, the ideas, the editing, the overall content, astonishing work!
the jobless bro on saturdays at the finest
No pls no u had to rickroll😢
Can you speak german becouse cast crafter is an german Youtuber
Bro secretly rick rolled us
Rock'n'roll realy
You know that you are rich when you use block of emerald to block of random bits of lava
You need to make it bigger. Make a Tsar Bomb. Right now it is just 3.25 Megatons of TNT. For perspective, Tsar Bomb has 50-58 (we'll take just 50) Megatons of TNT. So, you need to make it 15.3 times larger. Here's a wiki of Tsar Bomb if you don't believe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba  To calculate all that, you'll need to use Trinity (the Oppenheimer Bomb, which has 25 kilotons of TNT) (wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(nuclear_test) ), then use the calculator, multiply 25 by 130 (as Wumba said, his explosion is 130 times larger), then convert it into megatons (this link: https://www.google.com/search?q=kilotons+to+megatons&rlz=1C1VDKB_enCA985CA985&oq=kilotons+to+megatons&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDY1NjdqMGoxqAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 ) then finally you can divide the Tsar Bomb's power by that you've got.  P.S Hi Wumba! Comment if you are scared of consequences of this bomb :D
The fact you rickrolled us twice is wild lol.
I think I have seen some of your old domino videos a long time ago
H O P P E R S
Did nobody realize that he just rickrolled us😂
Definitely deserve the 1 million subs bro 👍 the work you put into videos is insane! I really want to know how many hours you have on Minecraft lol keep it up 🙏🏽
This is real content thank you for going above and beyond for your subscribers your awesome 🫡🙏👍
Bud became Oppenheimer
44:08 I freaking knew it.
LTN moment
Your new editor is fire 🔥
36:56 Gravitrax
Openheimer got me like:
what mods do u use
It happend on my birthday
I seen  that I have been a little more than a few  tnt and you have to get the materials in 100 days in minecraft hardcore  and you  need 4809702 sand and 6696002 good  job getting 1000000 sub soon will you  play tornado 🌪  survival mode
8:46 SINCE WHEN DOES THE TOTEM BLINK?!?!
The transitions were he shows which stages of the project are like Mr. Beasts videos. If you know you know I guess.
i bet the huge music box  olays a rickroll
Imagine if something activated the skulk sensor, im glad it didnt happen
I just subscribe so add one more TNT
i wish i had the patience and time to do similiar things, but nope. School, Work and ADHD
Greatest minecraft video ever!
Imagine is the chicken survived 😂
u should get the replay of it and post the whole explosion lol
hoppers
You should have enchanted your PC with blast resistance lol
bro got his hardcore world saved by luck again. Play The Lottery, with your luck you could win with ease
thermal pads help cool ur ssd  or like water cooling for ur ssd with watere cooling ur pc basicly cant get too hot
didn't get me w the rickroll, i just skipped 10 secs at the "gonna"
41:06 OMG 2 WUNBA'S  Also  he rickrolled us twice
Why are there egg stacks of 64?
tnt cant go threw obsidian
Very subtle rick roll at 10:13. I like it. It's well made
i paused u never gunna rickroll me
The guy who repaired your PC the fact he didn't check the motherboard before he advised you to buy another hard drive means you need to find a new PC repair shop.
He Rickrolled us twice if you didn’t relize
44:00 no way bro rickrolled us
I will do 2 pushups for every like I get
The Oppenheimer music goes crazy
24:34 you spelled "dominoes" wrong btw
10:02 we got rickrolled
The Trinity test is nothing compared to the other nukes that were made. The most powerful nuke (Tsar Bomba)was 50 megatons
17:15 gi place some scaffolding with the auto cli- The scaffolding: becomes a particle accelerator
we just got rickrolled two times in one vid.......and i loved it sooo much!
I think this is the greatest YouTube video I have ever seen. The tension that you build over the video towards the last 2 beautiful mins of that explosion, how can I explain, I was so intrigued to watch it and it was so satisfying. Truly, a very great moment of my life. Pls upload the full chain with real and Minecraft footage with no cuts, that would be so much Interesting to see.
Hardcore players these are like: random big impressive bullshit go
Oh, no, I have. What music it was?
I just got freaking rickrolled
shulker box to store sand
Oh my gosh!!! I have nothing to say
Two Rick rolls in one video, well done
41:06 whos that on the left?
Just when I got the Oppenheimer movie down to my phone to watch later
“But what if I told you”   Why am I seeing a shadow of a cat?
2:56 Wunbaheimer
not that impressive
Videos like this are the reason I can watch videos over 40 minutes long in one sitting (Edit: This is EXTREMELY underrated)
You know clay is also a gravity block right? You could have used the farm
It's quite numbing. The scaling in incredible feat. First, a big tnt, then, a chain reaction that's very crazy, the amount of it...  I should say "wow it's amazing", but... I've become used to that.
Loved
Bro turned his pc into the nuke.
At 16:49 you cannot see wunba's hearts as if he was in creative mode
WHY THERE IS RICK ASTLEY FINAL WORDS!?!?!?!
Anyone who is reading this i just wanna let you know That Jesus loves you repent and you are the most wonderful person ever <3
I wouldve had a whole different card specifically for the important files so that i would lose them. Then id have another huge save sd card or whatever specifically for the world
Imagine if the creeper spawn in the cube 😂😂😂😂
14:00 "and the money thats gonna cost" me: *laughs in european*
And I say I spend lots of time and effort on my videos...
This is why we have the crafter
44:07 bro literally rickrolled us
This video will get as much likes this comment gets!
Wait so is it just hoing to be a giant tnt or is the title just clickbait
Holy crap that explosion was insane, also banger video I think you should do this again but with 2mil tnt for when you get 2million subs
This video was crazy and I love the song at the end too.keep up the good work
Why is your game so saturated?
Insane effort here. But please, for your own sanity's sake, please invest in an automated backup service. If your career revolves around a single folder, you better make sure it's preserved.
wunbanheimer
A long video for a 5 second explosion
i predicted the rickroll lol
10:18 nah, you be rickrolling us
This was truly a beautiful and marvelous experience Wunba! Congrats to 1.000.000 Subscribers and the work that you put into this video and usually into all your videos is amazing! And it was so dramatic at the same time! Fantastic, great video glad I watched it! Congrats and people subscribe to Wunba!
THAT WAS SO COOL! BEST VIDEO WHAT YOU MADE! THX FOR MAKING SO SO SO GOOD STUFF AND WASTING YOUR TIME TO BUILD THAT AMAZING PROJECT
THIS VIDEO IS INSAINE, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE THAT TRIED TO DO SOMTHING LIKE THIS, AMAZING!!!🔥🔥
it was amazing
I am beyond impressed holy shit??? Not only did you put the time and dedication into collecting, crafting and placing the items, but you pushed beyond what you thought was possible. Your computer tried to give up, but you didn’t let it. Truly incredible!
Next time. Keep a world download on an external hard drive.
Why did you blur your feet?
45:45 bro basically made hiroshima nuclear bomb  2
It will Rick roll us
The village:💀
that is not a scientifically accurate nuke
Bro clearly became addicted to Oppenheimer after watching it.....
RIP chicken
brain rot
what pc do you have?
41:08 why blurring your creative mod
Did you manage to recover your files?? 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I've broken your record at least a hundred time in creative mode when my friend annoys me
Bro, treat yourself with a keyboard.
A scientifically accurate nuke transferred to Minecraft tnt would only be 8000 blocks of tnt.
He would need at least 1 BILLION tnt to make a Tsar Bomba......
Dominos Pizza Dude starts Domino Reaction for a Nuke. WOuld have been a better Title
Wuuuuunba! A Rickroll? Aaah I was thinked u put that when u placed the note blocks When u collected items u spoiled a but so yeah.
It was worth the wait bro
yo u did a great job, just a note i need the schematic
He rickrolled us
I feel bad for you
12:55 he has a wodden axe in his inventory just like he was using world edit its not suprising at all that he fakes his vids
You are a crazy person who has no life 💀😱
10:05 10:07 10:09 10:10 10:12
This video was absolutely amazing. You deserve every amount of subs or likes or views you get from this video and this is probably one of the most amazing videos I've ever watched. It really shows that anything is possible as long as long as someone has dedication.
Wait did you lag out?
well RIP chicken
Anyone realised that his totem blinks?
lol 64 stacks of eggys at 29:52
he spent a lot of time building safety stuff but he forgor turtle master potion or blast protection on his armor and even golden apples is this a joke
Someone is an etho fan
keep up the same brain rotting content in the same style as everyone else
did u survive ?
THIS IS SOO SICKK i love everything you do this is one of the best 1,000,000 sub special i have ever seem
How is this a scientifically accurate nuke?
Hiii
@ali
Wunba Ive been here since like 30k or something epic
What auto picker was that oml
Bro rickrolled us!
couldnt you just have gone in the nether instead of taking your time to build a giant chamber, use your obsidian, and waste all those totems when you didnt really need them?
RIP to that chicken in the mine cart that died to set the bomb off
Rick roll!?😂😂
Scientifically accurate lol
What a coincidence! 27 is the number of effects required for “how did we get here”
The most powerful nuclear bomb is Tsar Bomba which is equilent to 50000 kilo tons or about 25 times this explosion
Daymmm that was a big blast
Cast hatte den Weltrekord abow
this is more important than the roman empire
How old are you 🤔
is it possible to get what ever that music machine was in bedrock edition
This has gotta be hands-down the most time, effort, and creativity I've even seen put into a 1 million sub special for any youtube video I've seen so far, amazing :p
He said That he had more TNT than anyone in hardcore mode and he said he's making the world record.😂😂😂😂😂
Like if u got rick roled
does anyone know what storage system that wunba use to store all the sand 9:45
Well alexa real enters the chat💀
You can use torches for the falling sand…
i knew i would get rickrolled once i heard there would be a song
imagine the pizza guy watches this
how did u bypass 20 tps by placing 66 blocks per second
12:54 bro spent 2000 xp and gained them back in less than 5 seconds how
DONT SCARE ME BC UR MY FAV YOUTUBER I THOUGHT UR GONNA DELETE UR CHANNEL WUNBAA I WAS SCAREDDD 😵
best episode you've ever made story wise and editing wise
Press the F1 button, then the Enter button and the Enter button again this Must Turn on the computer
I totally forgot this is hardcore, like my man is living in the edge hahahaa this is awesome man
at 10:10 never gonna give you up
Dude. Help is available. Also, did your world survive? If 20 TNT is enough to crash my game, I can't think what 1,331,000 would do to yours 😆
Its interesting to see castcrafter as a reference xD
I used to watch ur dominos videos and i was waiting to see another one but i never did and i wondered where u went but now i know and ill definitely be watching ur vids again
omg. bro you should make a world backup every 100 days or so.
44:20 you are a wonderful menace <3
Just FYI you may want to remove the guinness world record logo. I've heard they can be weird about people using it... 36:33
I will do one push up every 5 likes

Fun fact: this bomb is probably closer to the strength of the Tsar Bomba
Everyone: that is soo impressing  Me: What movies did he watch? How did a dolphin drown?
Why the rickroll
10:10 bro is like Never Gonnna Give You Up
My Dude watched Oppenheimer a little too often

44:02 how did I know it was gonna be never gonna give you up?
2 billion kg of force?!!
there's no way I just got Rick rolled
Ima just say, Wunba, Your awesome
the most creative rick roll
oh my god only if the music was a rickroll
bro rick rolled us at the end
The device was cool but we could barely see the blast. You didn’t even let us see the particle effects from the explosion…
I love the music + hate ut😂
Jort storm song is in he backr9und
this truly is one of the minecraft videos of all time
Wunba are you still streaming? I always was happy to look your streams but since a half year it seems that there were like 3 streams or so ...
This deserves a more than 1M subscribers
now this was an insane video, awesome:)
congrats you made a nuke in minecraft and in real life (PC)
its amusing that the channel STILL isnt at 1,331,000 subs
OMG this video was a blast to watch
The rickroll💀
the cicken at the end
This video gave a heart attack to my computer nearby
Bro can you tell me the world seed
@Wumba you should really try to make a full netherite beacon after all this
Bro Rickrolled us 😂😂😂😂
If i am correct it was 2.145 Mt which is bigger than the biggest nuke in US's arsenal right now (1.2Mt)
11:34 lol is like a iphone ad
THE BOATEM POLE
4:30 wunba you are so handsome
bro turning into Mr Beast with the lil explosion on everything
I Like Your New Editor!
Get RickRolled lol
If I had a nickel for every time wunba has almost lost his word. I'd have 2 nickels witch isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.
Hey it's me Pate! I am here since the beginning.....you might remember me from the streams  I love watching hardcore youtubers like you, SB and some other youtubers who make semi technical semi creative builds which inspired me to make my own hardcore world  So yeah, I just wanted to let you know that you wont lose this fan ever!
the never gona give you up in the whispers🤣
I will clap my hands once every like this gets lol👏🏻
OMG...
I will do 1 push up for every 10 likes…  SHUT UUUUP!!
I want to know that you are alive or not? 😂
The most dangerous jobs: being this guy's pc  Pay:0$
no way i recently had that same exact thing happen to my pc my ssd completely burned out and died and i found out later after sending it to a guy my father knows that the fucking ssd was hitting upwards of 150 degrees when idling so im currently waiting for a replacement part to be shipped
And step 1 is to buy a NASA pc
Never been happier for getting rick rolled 🎉❤
omg :0
7:18 homeboy, what you're doing is more than fine, when it comes to content, ALWAYS go for quality over quantity
Did he survive? 😮😮
Fuk I get ricked roll
a nuke relies on pressure, radioactive components and chemicals, what you built is  a "nuke" you could build from a 1999 computer
Bro is NOT playing minecraft like a normal man
i have not watched the intintire video but that music note song is gonna rickroll me
AGAİN?!?!? 44:12
Now I become death the destroyer of worlds 🔥
wow
Also castcrafters explosion wahr ja schon krass aber ich freue mich auf diese explosion sehr
imagine placing so much tnt your computer actually breaks
to move more at a time, empty a single slot in each shulker box to fit more shulker boxes
The bottom hole
This comment is because I want this video to blow up ❤
Title says this is sxientifically accurate nuke, but I doubt real life nukes order pizza
Wait gimme a second, he said: Never, gonna, give, you up… WAIT DID WE JUST GET

Until it will order a pizza in real life he says 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
CastCrafter is a German YouTuber. W
get this video more views
Kaboom?  Yes, kaboom.   (Actual line from Madagascar i think, idk)
Wumba even if you upload squedale is bad whenever it comes out I watch in 1000 times U the best YouTuber out there
Can someone say witch mode did he use
putting the W in Wunba
crazy video keep up the good work
hoppers
I am not even joking i think this is the coolest thing I've ever seen especially in minecraft!
Bro this was one of the best videos of Ur journey and I hope U gain 10 Million subscribers one day because you put so much effort into these types of videos. Also can U show how many subs you gained because of this video? Keep it up.  # *Teachnoblade never dies* I subbed to Ur channel ne side he was Ur friend and when he died I subbed to Ur channel.
44:37 that chicken was so nervous that his eggs came out of his eggsack.
16:08  actually 1:04.6
Can someone explain to me, why the dolphin would need the conduit effect, like isn't it supposed to be able to breathe underwater?
Can you stop moving the fucking camea and punching the air, i get the 7yo have an attention spam of less than a second, but some people would like to watch a fucking normal video
mrbeast editing?
Me: Mom can we watch optimhimer  Mom: no hunny we have optimhimer at home Optimhimer at home:
first time on the channel and bro sound like skipthetutorial
10:03
Man's got dedication
How are there still trees in your world
Don't let @castcrafter see this one
How Much? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 12:46
RIP chicken 🐔 😅
Rick roll😂
how is the sand duper made?
3:01 blud thinks he mrbest 💀💀     random emojis to make ur day better: 🛫🏙
31:16  how can Minecraft give power to a lever that doesn't have any power source and the leaver gives power to something else???
Wumba is the best YouTuber ever!!
18:38 all of THE sudden? It’s “all of A sudden”
10:59 "were gonna me"
We can now officially call his Wunbaheimer
Love the new editing!
9:40 HoPpErS
STRAY KIDS 143
The reason your computer didn’t work is cuz of the ram ever computer problem is always cuz of ram
Imagine if one of the red blocks he used for the giant TNT block was a redstone block.....
8:00 props to you for making it sync with the music
10:05 the rickroll, lol
That is not "Scientifically Accurate" nuke. They work by putting the uranium/plutonium or other into a supercritical nuclear fission chain reaction. and "chain reaction" is the only "Scientifically Accurate" description of a nuke in this video.
People will group "minecraft hardcore creators" under the same label as if you are not on a completaly diferent level
Mom can we watch oppenheimer? we have oppenheimer at home.   oppenheimer at home:
You fuckin rick rolled us all
why did you blur out text in the chat at the end? cheating?
the scale of this video is so damn massive!!! keep up the hard work dude!!
your upload schedule worked you got this out before 1.3M
Imagine if you like the shell without tnt and you accidentally Flinton steel it and then it starts exploding
U have gravetraks
kinda sad that most tnt blew up in vain
you really had to put in the never gonna give you up when getting materials
unreal. amazing
Bro just turn into minecraft Oppenheimer
16:27 "and so I placed hours" great subtitles
bros pc was a nuclear bomb it self💀
Not the item collecting Rick roll
.
Ain’t no way I just got Rick rolled 💀
That problem happened with my PC too, that happens because of pressure on hard disk
Why don't you just turtle master and god apple
Bro we judge got rick roll
This isnt a Scientifically accurate nuke
I didnt even realise until now that you were one of my favorite person since you were stacking dominoes
No chickens were harmed in the making of this video
Im the 1515th comment.
Could you upload the craters created by the big bang nuke?
hi wunba just did some calculations and found out that minecraft tnt consist of 16 sticks of tnt 1 stick of tnt is 190 grams wich makes 16 sticks 3.040 kg multiply that by 13000000 you get 39.52kilotons wich is still almost 2,5 times bigger than the bomb detenated on hiroshima, but you calculated it thinking 1 qubic meter (one block) of tnt is pure tnt which i dont think it is, still great video and this is no hate comment or anything
Ah this so satisfying 🎉❤
the only real bomb was the PC
jo einfach castcrafter
This is very cool but all that googling you did to figure out the equivalent weight and power of bombs definitely put you on a list somewhere
bro just rickrolled us secretly
I thought damn that deserves a sub but turns out i had already thought that at some point became i was already subbed
is the best minecraft video i ever seen in my life dude hoppeneimer 2 sit
HE RICK ROLLED ME!
لو سمحت ممكن التخلي ترجمة للغاية العربية
Give me a 10,000,000
I KNEW THE MUSIC WAS GONNA RICKROLL US
10:13 did he just rickroll me?
Are you alive???
@castcrafter
2421 kilotons is quite powerful of a bomb because it can blow up approximately 160 square miles.   considering the fact that little boy has only 15 kilotones......wunba just created an atomic bomb at around 2 megatons worth of power
We are not gona tallk about Sandiction. And then you say you are not good about uploding.
I feel bad for the village right next to the nuke.
was the rick roll really necessary???
10:03 the orange text is a rickroll 🤦‍♂️
Bro we got Rick rolled😂😂😂😂
I did the math and the bomb literally weighs 4.842 TRILLION pounds
bro got a whole shulkerbox to only place one 28:37
I thought of an rickroll
did he just rickroll us?
Wumba since your ssd fried doesnt that mean that you also lost all of you important stuff
PLEASE stop calling it a "nuke" and call it a "nuclear bomb". it makes me feel like im watching a child play.
I love how so both Wunba and Mogswamp started off their channel with dominoes!
10:03 Nice Rick roll
can we get a counter for the overused sound effects
Never back down never what❤❤❤
is this how it is? as a delivery driver ive had to do some wacky stuff. how ever, if i was filmed delivering this i would love to see it. but what do i search? dominoes guys does dominoes delivery? guy orders dominoes and dominoes dominoes? no try " i set the biggest nuke off in minecraft" my coworkers would never believe me. cheers to you gaslight champion.
3:56 when did totems blink???????????
Nice video
also why ya rickrole us at the end?
Suggestion Wunba, use an external hard drive with backups of your world on a more regular basis
i got rickroled D:
Hoppers 💀💀☠️☠️
,,Never gonna give you up" Did you really think we dont notice
1:14 nice
how the freaking..HELL
The important thing isn't can you read the music it's can you hear it can you hear the music wunba
44:05 as soon as i heard the beat i knew...
Gud vidio
why does the saturation keeps changing?
Another BANGER from wunba!!!
29:35 or use a calibrated sculk sensor
The editing was fire 🔥
9:53 AND HOPERS Spam #Hoppers So that The Hoppers Wont Get Diabeties ever again
The way he sang never gonna give you up wheb he was gathering for the shulker thing
Thanks for the rick roll Wunba appreciate it!
Hahahahah destroyet of worlds ahhahahahha
funny someone did 27 million
its not that big
All the projects are impressive and massive, but Wumba somehow makes it look, not necessary easy, but just casual. Just another day for him, he has my respekt and adoration.
Guessing the song is gonna be a Rickroll. XD  Update:  It was.   Best Video I have seen since a long time. Keep going.
did anyone else see the rick roll?
the never gonna give u up lol
I like the new editing style, especially when expanding the autocrafting’s storage
We got rickrolled😂😂😂
Astonishing Man!! The Journey of Wunbaheimer !
Decemating planets
Insane
building a scientifically accurate nuke in minecraft is impossible without like 20 mods or 1 really really big one
I love the memory of killing 143 withers 🌟
HE JUST RICKROLLED US WHILE BUILDING A STORAGE SYSTEM
Hi wunba what autoclicker do you use? Could you give me a link to the download
G.O.A.T of Minecraft 🤌🤌🐐🐐
I sub now explode 1 tnt :P
Am I the only one who thinks Wunba sounds like Skip The Tutorial?
Oh hey if you don’t wanna watch the entire video go to 45:15
Wunba.... want to break the world record domino falling record? Come on, revive your past self. I will be watching...
never gonna give you up.
Shame on Wunba that he censores his foot
the thing is this will never come close to the power of the theorised bomb made by the soviets the TSAR bomb it was suppose to have 100 megatons or 100,000 kilotons of tnt
Not only Wunba created the largest tnt and even stronger than the first ever nuke but it's also crazy and remind me of those old dominos videos
Boss
Cast will have a comeback im sure 😅
I knew it was going to be never gonna give you up and I actually like the song
Never gonna give you up detail 🤣🤣
good video but what is bro yapping about during the chain reaction
WUNBENHEIMER
You seriously Rick Rolled us?
I won't do 1 pushup for every like this comment gets
how dare you rickroll me. edit: twice
This is so fake if you lost all that data how did you recover the recording of it ?
Hoppers hoppers hoppers hoppers you sound like the whopper guy from burger king
Please do a video exploring the crater that was left behind!!
this man really just whipered never gonna give you up
44:24 It's a great song choice
Knarfy: Feliz Navidad
I'll do 0.00000000000000000001 push up for every like this gets
Can you make a seperate video showing the aftermath of the explosion?
i doubt the scientifically accurate part, a nuke can be non-nuclear but tnt isnt made from gunpowder
NEW SUBSCRIBER!
bro i got rick rolled....
Every minecraft player after watching Oppenheimer:
rip chicken 😥
dream ahh back ground
0:10 you didnt
did you giggle & zoom in on a swastika shape near the beginning? has the black & white shape with the red outer parts, was actually framed for a split second, & you giggled...?
so this is how you make a perimeter
You rickrolled us!!!
i think the chicken in the mine-cart died :(
Did you just Rick rolled us between 10:01 to 10:14
45:25 destroy part
OMG I was watching domino chain videos when I was a kid. So was that you the WHOLE time??
As a German. I did not expect CastCrafter here
I watched right till the end and still don't know if u survived
I have watched all the streams that you did for this project and.... I literally got emotional at the end.....❤💙Bestest video ever on youtube with a roller coaster of emotions in minecraft!
What texture pack do you use for no particles when the block is breaking
10:03 can't just rick roll us and get away with is WE WILL GET ARE REVENGE
The true chaos instinct
Congrats on 1m Wunba, Love your Content :)
I legit was betting 1 million dollars that the song was going to be a Rickroll🤣
Bro needs more subscribers.. For another TNT nuke... (just kidding lol)
Broj Fr rickrolled US
DUDE????? ARE YOU OKAY????
This might have been one of the best thing I have ever seen in Minecraft 🎉
Big blast like my many nukes
13:29 i did some research thats Literally 2x as big of an expolison as the 2nd BIGGEST NUKE EVER created  not as big as the tsar cus thats 65 megatons and this is 2,4 mega tons but this is still the 2nd biggest nuke ever wich is Crazy
can you say what mods are you using? becouse i have a hardcore world with almost 200 days and i just want to speed up my crafting, building
10:05 read all the orange words ;)
35:42 for a split millisecond you can see an editors note
im pretty sure that much tnt can break bedrock
Blud literally invented the smartest way to rickroll someone
I knew the music was gonna be a rickroll so basically it didn’t get me
good video
lol
I am waiting for this special for this day
10:05 i love how he started to rickroll us
When I heard him say “I’m gonna keep the song a surprise”I knew he was gonna rickroll.I mean “song”,”surprise”,”WUNBA” oh yeah I saw that coming
44:13 never gonna give u up never gonna let u down never gonna turn around and hurt u never gonna say goodbye
Nice pc
Kinda fun fact: this is actually MUCH larger than a thermonuclear bomb. (This is just off memory so I might be VERY off)
I would love to see a tour of the crater
Dude having subtitles in your video i love you very appreciated sometimes i wanna watch a video and my Phone cant be too loud and youtube cc is trash so thanks
The fact, that he Rick rolled us all and most of us didn't even notice.
Holy fuck no wonder you hit 1 mil subs man, this looked like one of those really shitty clickbait old minecraft videos that were too good to be true, but somehow this is not clickbait in any way and somehow it's even more than the title and thumbnail say because my guy does it all in fucking hardcore. Insane job man, you deserve all that's coming to you.
TNT explode😮 45:18
well that was a clickbait full of side crap
i love how he says never gonna give you up in the middle of the video
What autoclicker do u use wunba?
The sacrifice of the chicken 😢
Sorry cast cant win today
I wanted to see that 5hrs collecting nether warts
that bomb has roughly 5x the power of tsar bomba or 1.25x the power of the 1883 vei 6 krakatoa eruption (produced the loudest recorded sound ever at 340 db)
I loved every minute of the video. It would have been epic if we had gotten to see the explosion more in depth, as well as more of the aftermath. It all being fitted into a one minute section at the end felt so bittersweet.
Chain reactions starts 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 36:23
I will do -1 pushup for every like on this comment
tnt can explode obsidian (just you need 50 tnt) XD
Dude thinks he is oppenheimer but good viedeo 👍🏻
Did he really just rick roll me?
Were you alive?
I will watch one minute of YouTube for every like this get
The Editor is so bad
That's a whole lot of commitment, thanks for being so determined!
“It’s gonna suck more than i do”💀
Wait 41:06
Wait 41:45
did he die
Wait 41:46
8:07 casually crealrs lava with emerald blocks
Its a good day when KingWunbagay posts 🥰
Can someone please explain why he has fire in front of his nether portal?
9:57  hopper hopper hopper hopper junior double triple hopper
2:35 this man almost killed himself before he even started
Why u rickroll me
Bro ur ep record would be soon broken by sb!Sb737 will break all the records of hardcore if he plays even after 10000 days!Petition for sb to maintain the series please!❤
WAIT I ACUALLY THINK I WATCHED UR DOMINO VIDEOS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER NO WAY
That was the first Video from your channel I saw. But definetly not the last one!
W video. 🗿🗿👍🏻
Japan shivering in the corner:
Couldnt you just ad speed tooo than its 6K blocks per second
I'm not not the explosion yet, but I guess the song will be The Final Countdown by Europe... dang. Now you even said that phrase while I was typing. Another clue I might be right  :D  Lol. Rickrolled. Nice one ^^
Rubys goldberg machine be like
*HOPPERS*
Bro hwo did ur 13k xp go to 11k xp??
The things I love about wunba: A. he loves math. B. He is creative and hard-working. C. Even when his PC fried, he didn't give up and researched. I would have 100% given up.
dude, the whole psu and mb frying 2 m.2 ssd's is literally so crazy, glad you got rid of them and did it
Nice try i knew there was gonna be a rickroll
its  so funy that he censors his feet
thankfully he censored his feet
41:06 what is this
18:41  that's certainly something you don't want to see the Power On Self Test (POST) failure screen also let this be a lesson everyone ALWAYS BACK UP IMPORTANT FILES you never know when / if your hard drive or SSD is going to self-destruct
24:15
19:44 was dissapointed you didn't say "now i am become death, the destroyer of worlds"
35:36 Who is gonnal tell him that a 1×1×2 would have been enough
I really appreciate of what his doing and if you appreciate what is his doing 👇leave a like and comment
World record for the most effort put to rickroll! Congratulations lmao I was not expcting it
How many people got rickrolled at 46:18
Wunba really knows how to keep us entertained! From Rickrolling us to building impressive projects, he never fails to amaze. Congrats on reaching 1 million subscribers, well deserved! Keep up the great work!
RIP The Chicken who light the TNT
2 minutes in an he already built the shell. What has minecraft youtube become?
44:00 did i really just get rickrolled by a minecraft domino contraption 😭
kinda skeptical of the m.2 just dying high end mobos dont just supply too much power i think there was other reasons
10:00 rick roll
44:10 was the best part
does putting a shulker into a shulker work?
This is probably one the greatest minecraft videos ever made, the only thing is that I think we all wanted a little more of the explosion, or honestly just to see a little more of the crater afterwards
wunba is op good in mincraft btw 1.000.100 😃😁
The fact he rickrolled us 10:03
I knew I was gonna get Rick rolled at the muwic
are you going to quit YouTube ? 🥺
um i spent 5 min with world edit thats just so sad   it was awesome though and big
Secret msg in the video Witch  is "Never Gonna give you up" Lol
Bro think he's oppenheimer💀🙏
u are a genius 🧠🧠🧠
YOU RICK ROLLED ME!
Lier the record is more than 15m Google tells fake stuff about tnts
bro just causually rick rolled us at 10:03
I love explosives.
your fast crafter now has a dumpy
Wait did he die?
DID SOMEONE SAY CHAIN REACTION?
You have a very nice background love the black hole
w pizza man
next make it a THERMO nuclear bomb
GOOD blo vg ap velegs
Day 👇👇teme
Bruh you just Rick roll 😂❤
Why do you have a wooden axe in your inventory, 12:55 did you use world edit?
29:52 the new editor did an oopsie eggs can't be stacked to 64
Bro was humble and didn't include 'hardcore' in the title
YO drop the autoclicker
Bro really rickrolled us
bro really thought he could rickroll us and thought we wouldn't notice
Nutty video. I don't really understand why people are so hyped about hardcore and insane farms but i can understand it for this video.
Imagine saying "i was trying to place  a bajilion tnt in minecraft and my pc broke" to a computer guy
Great vid
Bro Rick rolled us
i got rick rolld
Big boom
You ruined my life with the rickroll
Still not powerful as castle bravo and tsar bomba. Here is the the strenght.  1 Megaton = 1,000 Kiloton's or 1,000,000 Ton's.  Your tnt: 2.650Megaton's Castle bravo: 15Megaton's Tsar bomba: 58Megaton's  Fun Fact: The russian's put the bomb to 58Megaton's but they want 100 Megaton's of TNT.   Well. Did you survive tho?
this was actually like a baby sensory video, i was hooked from start to finish 😭 awesome job
Good hardwork
Bro.. you need to get a NAS server to keep backups on... and make sure it's in a RAID configuration so that storage is mirrored. (I would genuinely recommend looking into this, they're not TOO expensive depending on how much storage you want, (if you want 1tb of usable storage, you'd need to get 2tb of storage if you mirror the data), and typically pretty easy to setup.)
Why da totem blink
This is insane!
@Wunba What monitor do you have (the main one)
HOW DID YOU GET THOSE FLUFFY CLOUDS?
Bruh just Rick rolled us☠️☠️
why you rick roll me
I cannot wait to see the next video❤🎉
A collab with Wunba and SB737 would be legendary
bro like HOW DO U DO THIS
Bruh the fact that mc youtubers still havent learned to back up their worlds on cloud or another drive is crazy to me. Like this is your whole career and ur just gonna leave it on one drive
you've achieved a world record and rickrolled 170,000 people TWICE. nice
insane
I love the explosion ❤🎉😊
If you put the explosion in neather you could get thousands of netharaite
So this is who stole one of NASA's computers. Found him!
the efert
its wild with the fact he got around 113k subscribers in 15 hours
Dayummmmmm ❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
WIC Warzone it sounds like never give you up no yet you down
bro how you gon forget that you literally uploaded your whole world online
bro left the pizza man
2 RICKROLLS IN 1 VIDEO
wunba does so mutch for his fans!
wow tnt go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
inmense hard work
10:00...
the best song
W
genuine creative and fun to watch video :) keep up the effort
Hmm poop powered nuke excellent 32:20
I TURNED MY COMPUTER INTO A THERMONUCLEAR BOMB!!!
im just rick rolled in 2024🎉🎉
Rube Goldeburg Minecraft machine
that chicken didn't deserve to die smh
Goat video man freaking legend
Did you die?
The editing was amazing
How long do your edits take!
i am so sorry about ur lost data
So happy I was able to be part of the first million subs! Congrats broski
The totoms eyes moved that room mt by suprise
The Oppenheimer music at 12:50 got me 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I can’t belief we have gotten the the point where “I just killed 143 withers” is a regular thing, and that this is regular minecraft content
Mogswamp is a W. You are also a W. Keep up good work :)
Hiii
Instead of fixing your pc and you should get a new one, and create a daily backup while you are at it.
We were making Rube Goldberg machines in science Friday lmao
Never gonna give you up!!! Never gonna let you dooowwwwn
Mango smoothies are very good
I love the “never gonna give you up” in the naming of the materials part lol
I watched you when you had 700k subs and I remember when you dug that big hole AND I know you were on some Mogswamp livestreams
dont forget to pin the tnt world to patrion for a while
Always a great day when wunba uploads out of the blue
The amount of effort you put into your videos is MIND BLOWING!! No pun intended lol
You really outdid yourself
Someone should should make a tnt as powerful as the tsar bomba, it had a yield of 3,500 times little boy and its shockwave circled the earth three times
the rick roll at 10:03
10:10 bro really thought he could rick roll us with out us knowing 🤣
Nice karate board I have one
9:55 most subtle Rick roll
Hey kids, here's how to make an actual (thermo)nuclear bomb. 1. Obtain Uranium-238 2. Encase it in a dense shell of Tritium and Deuterium 3. Encase that casing in high explosives This will cause a fusion and rapid fission reaction in the form of a thermonuclear explosion
Do you know making nuclear bombs are illegal at home
Jason was amazing
"This lush cave," WHERE IS THE CAVE?!
2250 kilotons
I’d you survive?!?!?
I'm your biggest fan and you have inspired me to start a hardcore world I'm on day 34
absolute w editing
i think wunba is slowly going insane
Why do you put fire outside of your nether portals?
Bro you know the internet is stupid when people have to blur they’re feet
Did anyone see the totem blink?
the world record is over 3m
Wunbanheimer
How is this scientifically accurate to a real nuclear bomb though?
2:44 they are holding him captive
2:44 call 911 pls
i would really love to see the raw footage of this! awesome job
I called 911 and you are propabally safe
10:04 cool Easter egg
BTW wut auto clicker u using? mine is the "OP autoclicker" and is not good at all
😒thats why u where so long poating vids bc u did a afk a month!!! Dude i hope i cant see someone suffer i mean me .bc im bored theres no vids thats cooler than this .except acookiegod and wenzo
where is the perfectly cooked frozen pizza zone
10:05 he hid the words for rickroll
He probably used gm 1 to get these items because he's content creator, not a regular player and he has no reason to waste time.
Thanks for 0 likes 😢
Can u gimme a shoutout my dream is 30k subs 😢
Bro think he muslim 💀💀(no hate)
I will not do 1 push-up for every like i get on this comment
Never watched a 45 minute Minecraft video before.
Raid farm tutorial video pls ?
this is what happens when you take notes while watching oppenheimer
The fact that we got rickrolled 2 times in this video...
Somehow i managed to guess the song that was going to play 😅
Rickroll is so nostalgic
A Wunba video is never complete without a Rickroll
POV: My dad on the toilet
this is NOT a scientifically accurate nuke
the ending gave me goosebumps
The fact he kept going for his viewers is insane you didn't have to go this hard
Op 😮😮
In your next episode, you should kill god
I dont see how people could complain about your upload schedule if they took a moment to think about how much time goes into this, not including all of the editing, scripting, and being a functional human being on top of it.   Personally id rather have a great video after two months than a meh video after 2 days.   Your dedication to this is awesome. I wish i had the patience you do.
WUNBA CONGRATULATIONS ON REACHING 1MIL SUBS (now lets try getting you to 2mil subs)
Incredible dedication
w music
Im gonna call this Operation Wunba
yay i got a tnt with my name on it
@wunba the chances of getting  the 750th poster has a 1 in 750 chacne of getting it but due to the price of 20$ to get all posters you will need to pay 15,000 $
Bruh did you just Rick rolled us
Moment of silence for that delivery driver actually pushing the domonies. What a w guy
isnt this a 1.3mt nuke?
"whats gonna happen to my pc" - missed opportunity for a joke involving your pc being a nuclear bomb or something along those lines
45:20 and then he sacrificed THE CHICKEN 🍗🐔
instead of placing that much tnt, you could have used tnt minecarts and concentrated all them in 1 block
One like = 1 prayer for the amount of pain wunba put into his pc
good thing a creeper didnt come along
do you know picapo?
not very impressive
Ive been wunbaroolled
Bro became Wunbenheimer
nice editing
No way he consider quit😂
The IRL chain reaction was something out of Tom and Jerry
Wunba and Mud Flaps are probably the two most hardworking, impressive, and completely dedicated individuals in the entire Minecraft community
But did you live tho?
Youtube, please stop giving me minecraft youtuber slop and war videos about wars idc about
So he just made a Rube Goldberg machine
I am become death
Man hats off to the content made !! Truly unique and the best ever
did anyone find the rick roll at 10:04
A Rube Goldberg Machine
Bro just Rick rolled us, why no one is talking about that 😭😭 10:00  Edit: nah he did it again 😂, congratulations for the world record btw it's worth waiting months to watch your videos ❤
Nice
when was this recorded? its at 1.14m now?
I mean, not scientifically accurate, but subjectively awesome.
at the start when he blew up that tnt my vid buffered when it started to blow up and I thought it was apart of the video then i rewinded it and it wasnt 💀
Not the Rick roll at 10:03
Le boom
Let’s get domino wunba back
please make a on and off site backup of your hardcore world
I was there for the stream where you shared the Never Gonna Give You Up music box setup originally!
That was like me In bed
that chicken is a terrorist
My boi that's a *THICC* eggssplosion
Wunbaheimer
Amazing video! Thank you so much for all you do for your fans, you work so hard for all of your videos.
Building something in that crater would be cool. I also asume that you lived since we did not get to see too much of the aftermath :(. Cool vid :)
The chain reaction was your casa bonita
you made a nuke more power ful than the nuking of nagisaki and hirosima
10:03 did he RICKROLL us??
that bomb /is 2.421 megatons of tnt
I am actually a bit embarassed it took me so long to notice that you ordered Domino's because you set-up a domino chain
Your dedication is incredible!
Wait! You left out a vitally important detail!        How was the pizza? :)
What movies did you watch during the crafting period?
32:38 bro blurred out his feet XD
Did I just get whispered a rick roll....
Lil bro is NOT that deep 😭😭
bro said the Oppenheimer quote
I’m so happy 😂
45:24 rip
Whispers* Never gonna give you up
Jason is a W
guys skip to 44:06
THAT'S JORT STORM!!
Legendary.
17:14 HOLY!!!!!!!!!! 💀
Talking of a comeback, my God.🤯
Waitt.... so is the series over?
NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP
Omg Wumba I had no idea that the domino channel was urs I used to watch u so much as  a kid!
what 3 movies was it?
Yo that song was pretty catchy too when is your music disc dropping
I got rickrolled twice
not enough TNT that was lame
And hoppers
Dude this is just a work of art at this point
Love the new cut
We all know u made this video just as an excuse to rick roll us
I LOVED THE EDITER AND SKIPPED THE RICK ROLL!
I love that song
Bro really build castle bravo at this point 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Does anyone else feel clickbaited? There was nothing scienticfically accurate about this "nuke", and instead he just made us wait 46 minutes to watch a tnt statue explode 😐😐
Future me, was the music a rickroll?
Bro Rick rolled his viewers
hey wunba, how much does your world weigh? i bet its over 15 GB with all the chunks you've loaded!
Awesome Video! Congratulations on 1Million subs!!
This is why he deserves 10mil subs!
44:06 i knew it
I did not know Wunba was gonna be the next Oppenheimer 😅   Edit: OMG WUNBA LIKED MY COMMENT
the dominos are like that one honda accord ad
Blud is the MrBeast of Minecraft videos
So um totem dispenser sure but ehat happens if 1 blocws up machine and 2 kill you?
10:04 I got Rick rolled 😂
52 seconds in and im hooked lol good job
Holy crap, that was like an entire life story movie. That's some insane levels of determination. Keep it up!
BRUH                     😊
WHA?
i dident know it was you with the dominos i wached them like 3 years so much effert lost😢
I KNEW IT WAS GONNA BE A RICK ROLL I KNEW IT
"Scientifically accurate" ( love the oppenheimer reference though )
this is not a nuke i could build a better one in my backyard i already have so easy
You really threw me for a loop when you brought pizza man Jason into this. LOL
this guy has more determination than Frisk in undertale! way to power through!
even though you didnt die at the end  you should have got blase protection
The way bro said "he just died 🥺" is so funny to me
What happend to the opd editor did you have a fall out or just a beter job opertunity?
fore you uncaltured people he rick rolled you
2:00 Wunba causally be like "I think if we get 143 beacons this'll be a lot faster
hoppers, and hoppers, and hoppers, and hoppers, and hoppers, and hoppers, and hoppers, and hoppers, and hoppers, and hoppers, and hoppers, and hoppers, and hoppers, and hoppers, and hoppers, and hoppers.
Hold up did you just Rick-roll 106,000 people, and most didn’t even realize it?
Thank you,I appreciate your hard work on this project. Love your vids keep making them,Never give up,And stay safe in this world
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NTASDdaWadad ad
Can you upload an unedited video of the full 90 minute explosion? That would be absolutely freaking sick
44:24 HELL NAW
Was the pizza good?
10:15 bro he Rick rolled us. Who else saw that???
Bro my cat died today and that first song I hear is a rickroll bro?
He rickrolled us at 10:03
Doesn't compare to my (irl) Nuke
why did he blurr the hotbar at 41:08?
that is wrong the biggest nuke ever is about 1000 more power full and the explosion damage is still smaller based on Minecraft's explosion mechanics
Define "Scientifically Accurate"  Edit: You changed it to "Mathematically Accurate" so its correct now, thanks.
if its not an atomic bomb its a hydrogen bomb :D cause hydrogen bombs are way stronger than atomic bombs edit we all became part of that destruction us the subscribers destroyed the village we left a crater keep up the good work wunba love your content and all your amazing work
i thought for that song we were going to get rick rapped
Hoppers Hoppers hoppers
Its not accurate because its Minecraft and there is no fall out
I hate you so much because of the music😂
One of the biggest Minecraft trolls of all time!!😅😅😅
Keep up the good work man :)
12:56 The Openheimer theme fits good as background music
I don't understand this
Every like and I will do 1 push up with my fingers instead of my hands
The rick roll caught me unawares
never goanna give you up.
Bro just needs almost 3 shulkers of shulker shells
love the rickroll wumbaheimer? =)
dsf
15:36 - MY MAN, imagine losing a hardcore world to drowing! I mean, I see the totem, but it took me a while to remember it.
I KNEW IT IT WAS A RICK ROOL
44:23 knew it
視点を動かしすぎて酔っちゃうぅぅ～～
👇🏿only true wunba fans can like this comment
Thank you very much again dear Wunba, for this masterpiece. Of course i would love to see every night some good content, but in the first, your a human and deserve private time and rest. Keep it up, take all the times you need for minecraft and we are all behind you, we got your back. ❤️👍
bro pulled a mr beast and exploded everything
I OVE THE NEW EDITING OMFG WOW
i just noticed that at 32:40 you blurred your feet so people dont take feet picks XD
A cross-dimensional no cross Universal Rube Goldberg machine that will set off 2.2 megatons of TNT can't see anywhere where this could possibly go wrong
How big is the pixels in blocks bc I might build that
I watched you design the big TnT and your finally done! Great job Wunba! (Edit: HOW DARE YOU RICK ROLL US IN THE GATHERING OF ITEMS FOR SAND STORAGE SYSTEM!!! >:(   )
17:48 “If I took a dolphin on a lead underwater, it would eventually drown.”
10:03 i hate you for doing never gonna give you up
Yo love that you are  a cuber too, cubes are my life.
new editor is fucking insane 💀🔥
NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP
Did you lost your world
idk if you will read this but IRL VID WITH THE RUBIX CUBES AND THE GRAVITRAX????????!?!??!?!?!!?!
man, you are a fucking goat
Wish we could’ve seen more of the aftermath but great video 👍
Just letting you know it took me only 15 minutes to get all the info you had blurred. I do this for other youtubers and let them know they should use black bars. It is VERY easy to unblur something.
Did you just Rick roll every one here??!? Ok y’all to hear him Rick roll you it’s at 10:03- ends at 10:15
31:56 skavio's weight made the boat too heavy to move by a minecart smh.
WAIT OMG ITS SB737
its 1am i live in the uk and i should be in bed rn but i brang my lenovo laptop running windows 8.1 and now i am still awake watching this
This shit fake
Am I the only one who thought that after the storage card fried why didn’t he backup his world externally as soon as he got it fixed the first time by the computer dude?
Anybody else get Rick rolled
I also hate computer issues
did you say never going to give you up when getting materuls
That what the atomic nucleic nuclear bomb or the annb
32:39  Am I the only one who noticed that when he's worrying about getting copyrighted he ACTUALLY CENSORED HIS SHOES??!! Such a nice touch, honestly.
That's no atomic bomb
2:57 Oh where will you go in the blinding flash
💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣💣
Wow... you did it.
couldn't you just have used boat chests in minecarts to bring the gun powder over?
Only people who watched the live stream when he hit 1m can like this comment ❤ 🎉
Where did you get the auto clicker?
NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU UP
PCheimer: Fried liked toast
Wait is Wunba looksmaxing?
I mean if the tnt was realistically strong (like an 80 block diameter... Or radius idk explosion) but tnt is too weak so it's not like a nuke whoopsies
now THAT'S A hardcore episode!
YOU DID IT!!! SOOOO WORTH IT
this is not a nuke... it is a anti-mater bomb
Before 10 hours idk why I do dis I'm confused 🤔?
nice mouse, the G502 is a solid mouse i also have it, and nice rickroll
make a video on the destruction
yeah, but its not scientifically accurate, just a bunch of tnt edit: he fixed the title to say mathematically accurate woohoo
How convenient that is was next to a village hmmm....
This is your 3rd video in a row I haven't been notified for. Seems to be happening for me lately.
are you cheating? Why ur levels always jump from 13290 to 11131. Huge example at 12:44
I never thought the instrumental for Jort Storm would be used in a minecraft video but here we are
F’s in the chat for the one chicken at the end for its sacrifice
did I get rick rolled 10:05
Even though it's not a true hydrogen bomb, this is still a feat worth recognizing
I will do [insert number] push-ups for every like this comment gets
But did you survive?
Give some kind of reward to that dude that reminded you about the world download, he saved this entire project.
Video Title is click bait.
a moment of silence to the chicken that lit the tnt
Bro has ton 618 black hole on his computer
Such a shame that you had to cheat to do this
I used to watch videos where people detonated a lot of tnt, but I liked those ones. I don't really like this one cus you kept yapping..
openheimer
Who else is here before this video gets copyrighted? 👇
istg wunba just getting a rick rolled and that's why he's put 3 rick roll in this video
18:35 (for wunba) the American Megatrends screen only happens if it typically indicates a problem with the basic input/output system (BIOS) or a hardware issue. This means that when you were building the machine froze, then the bug on the BIOS was that causing to freeze, you turned it off, and you saw the Megatrends screen.
Bro really made a Minecraft Rockwell a masterpiece
You are my fav
russia is jealous
Hey remember me when you get fa...... Oh ya.... nevermind
i thought there was only 3 strongholds in a world?
Comment
Did you cut your hair?
did you die
Did you die or everything's good?
Ah wumba give the link to that auto clicker
That pizza guy is still waiting outside 😂😂
The orange text says never gonna give you up
Cool but rip chicken
the amount of persistence is crazy. 2 fried memory cards, a new motherboard, and weeks of effort later, here is the video. (i would also like to say, when you mentioned being worried about getting a copywrite strike, i immediately knew what was coming from another channel i watch)
What autoclicker do you use, cuz its crazy especially the scaffolding placement
that one creeper👁👄👁
The music box rickroll, simply the best youtuber
I bet the pc have 130x power than the bomb your building
Me after eating chipotle with extra sour cream
Did the chicken in the minecart survive?
he quoted oppenheimer
That is not the world record!
CastCrafter poggers
You just copied mogswamp dominos😅😅😅😂😂
I’m confused did he die or not
what movies did you watch while crafting the tnt?
Wunda you are incredible, an inspiration, i love you!!!
Whats the song that plays at 0:59?
Option 1: AFKing for 50 hours Option 2: Going to 5 Strongholds to entirely dig them out and building a monstrocity of a farm there which is way too fast for the sorter in the end so you have to redesign that one just that you need to AFK for only 10 hours  Wunba: Option 2 looks great
45:30 nom, nom, nom, nom, nom
You have to place one more I just subbed :P!
4:59 That was the single best animation I have ever seen. Thank you
Bro has a NASA computer 💀
hey or yeah, I'm not the only one to think of extremely hard things to do in a block game.
Idk bro just made me subscribe him
13:00 the oppenheimer reference was on point not gonna lie!
Amazing video as always but please find new editor or at least use less (none) of those goofy meme sound effects and wannabe funny cuts
anyone notice the rickroll while he was explaining the stuff he used for the ultimate sand storing monstrosity?
“Storage card” oh boy
10:02 dont reed the yellov words when he is wispering matirials for the storage.
i was curious what song you're gonna play and when and when you actually did it i was like "oh ☠"
I knew it was a rickroll as soon as he said music box!
This video was a BLAST to watch! It really BLEW my mind with how much effort and time you put into this video! I did notice most (if not all) the books in this video was Middle Earth books which is making me think the next mega project you are doing is a Middle Earth/LOTR themed which I'm very excited for if that's the case! Wunba actually never showed if he survived or not so who knows if we will get another episode of Wunba's Adventures in Acenwood!
Wow, the end remind me so much of history channels…
amazing video
Really well made video! Wow!
W new editor😊
wunba really can pull off jokes that would be extreamely cringe if other youtubers did them but are actualy funny when he does them
Your creativity with the chain reaction is incredible. This is so neat!
stop teasing me
Joo i'm just now realizing that he's experians with grass is on Minecraft 😂😂
All panic and business until Rick astley shows up 😅😂
Did he die
45:24 Skibidi bop mm da da
It’s the end of the world as we know it
U have motivation man
i think actually that you might break a world record for the biggest bomb in real life- pc
That creeper was ready to press that dispenser, need like after so many years of feasting on the years of players could build I can finally go out truly with a bang, a bang truly respectable for a great creeper, I will become The legendary creeper of Minecraft, kaboom
Top editor espeacialy at 10:20
I watched most of your streams that you did building it
did you survive though
bro made a nuke so powerful it blew up his SSD
Hi wunba is the dono book still a thing?
you rick rolled us :|
Bro you ended yourmworld
Did anyone else realise that while he might have gotten his hardcore world back, all the other important files on that ssd are gone?
Wow
i'm on computor so its hard for me to play mincraft in my opinion but watching this makes me download it and play so thank you wunba.
When your biggest challenge is to transport massive amounts of items.
That was great video the dedication you put in is insane
Loving the editing! Also, congrats on 1,000,000 subs!      15:09 watch this hehehehe
Crazy
YouTube is about to be flooded with Minecraft Rube Goldberg machines lol
13:47 pc = nuke???
Can we just appreciate the amount of work wunba puts inside of us
what if a creeper blew up just before the last tnt?
Castcrafter❤❤
The vids are so good Keep it up wunba
Congrats on 1Mil! 🎉
For my Americans one tnt block weights around 3500 pounds
He literally posted the 1mil vid when he has 1.14mil😂
He Rick rolled us idk if anyone else caught that
Unreal man your dedication is unmatched, lets see that destruction tho!!!
You had one job with that noteblock song in the chain reaction! AC/DC TNT, it was the one and only perfect option.
45:27 for those who just want to see the explosion.
i was so worried something had happened to you that i didnt know about with the upload schedule and all but this is so cool omg
Wait you died
Bro the chicken in the minecard thought it is going to be a normal day and than that
24:18 is this giving anyone else "Mogswamp blowing up the end" flashbacks? these 2 are so similar and I love it!
im sorry but i think your pc died XD
i absolutely loved the fact that you were playing "Can You Hear The Music" during the segment where you were explaining how large the explosion would be
why was bro bluring out his feet
there's not much more to say than: I'm impressed! Don't stop doing what you are doing, everytime I see one of your videos I literally have to watch it, there's no way around that... Keep it up! <3
People who wants him to collect all of the tropical fish👇
2:37 bro has balls out of steal to land like this knowing how bugged elytra sometime is
Wumba world go boom boom
W
4:26 suspicious
See thats why you always make world backups on usbs or other devices, you barely got your stuff back...
Today is my birthday
Yes more blast!!!!
this video feels too edited, i would honestly like to see this man just randomly upload a pretty much not edited video of really whatever he wants. it can still have cuts and zooms here and there but they would have to be very basic. other than that the video was pretty good fun idea fun explosions
Nice Video dude could you do this again with the atomic bomb block from the alexs caves mod ? XD
Love the new editing so cool
Amazing
that was a W video
0:25 bro casualy standing infront of the farlands
Man I cant lie that issues with the computer and the other hard things you have to do is the thing that let me to subscribe to that channel in the first video I have seen on it. Sorry for bad english : ) . And man you are so hard working to do this video. YOU ARE AWSUME!!!
Bro, are you chris' voice from family guy?
Wow
It`s insane, broo,  u cool 😎
Literally wunbenheimer
Actualy i dont mind waiting 2 months to get good videos like that
The new editor was fire🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro you made your computer atomic bomb
How and why does his xp level decrease by 2000 at 4:33 ?
19:55 why didn't you backed up your world every few hours
34:00 Heikoooo
I should do this in my world 😅 should i? Also congrats on 1 million subscribers my friend keep it up ❤🎉
Cudos to u man, u are the embodiment of hard work
@castcrafter
YAY
well done thanks for your dedication
what if the bomb was real
I absolutely love the (probably) unintentional Hermitcraft reference with the Boatem Pole
Luke the notable made a nuke in his world and it only took him 100 days
Why were there two wunbas at  41:06
never gonna give you up lol
You had to do that song
NICE A GERMAN STREAMER Carstcrafter 👍
beatful video your videos are so good well done keep it up we will always love your videos and apprcitate the time and effort you put in these videos
10:00 secret Massage 😂 Never gonna give you up
Team who thinks he should make a build with the massive crater                  👇
Finally it’s out
UR CRAZY MAN, WHAT THE HELL WAS THE RICK ROLL. ANYWAYS . THAT WAS CRAZY
WAIT YOU DID THE MATH WRONG FOR THE KT MEASUREMENT AT 13:15  you didn't put to consideration the '''' weight strength'''' which if we consider it to be the average of 40 percent nitro-glycerine we'll have to consider if it is actually gunpowder or nitro-glycerine  if it is gunpowder then the 1,300,000 tnt's would have the power of 570,180,000 KT or 570,180 MT which is the equivalent of 10,003 Tsar bombas, if you cant tell still a lot  but if it is nitro-glycerine it would be then 1,488.36 KT or 1.48836 MT which is a lot less impressive so lets say it is gunpowder just because that's way more explosion  if you're going to say it is actually not dynamite you can look at the design an d realise its just a bunch of dynamite grouped together  correct me if I'm wrong.
my first minecraft world was in 2016, just as your channel😭😭
This is the single best Minecraft video there is on youtube. i love how you went the extra mile with the chain reaction, even after putting so much time into the nuke itself.
What did we learn from this video?  Our boy Wunda loves dirt plataforms 😅
The most dedicated mc YouTuber bro 1.1 million subs is a lot but it is not enough for this guy
Almost forgot to like 😅
he died or not
One good question is did he survived?
1 push up for every like😎
30:12 watching this to procrastinate studying for my sat and man can i relate to this
bro is Mr. Beast
I'll sacrifice one orphan child for every like this comment gets
Congratulations 👏👏
Did mans just quote technoblade at 2:55?
What all mods do you use?
Bro you should get some cloud storage
I just got rickrolled 😅😂
Insane dedication and congrats man this was awesome
Bro rickroled me
Why would you not show the explosion???? I waited 2 months for that?????????
He build minecraft at day and edit videos at night (sleeps one in q month)
The Rickroll was so predictable
Hey Wunba! Do you remember me?
Looks tasty
It´s funny hearing americans say german names by some reason
Even if you did, forget, the name tag, the new dolphin, they do die overtime because they will not not move when you’re out of the range so they will die from drowning or suffocation
The chain reaction felt like the wasted time you had to go through just to get to the good part, artificially extending the video was never a good idea.
Bro blurred out his toes 💀
I will take one step every like this comment gets (i will make a vid for proof)
YES
Love the new editor
xD
The Oppenheimer reference thoo💀
I legitimately think it’s the best Minecraft video I’ve ever watched. Wow
I think you should invest in a external hard drive, Wunba
bro made two nukes in one episode.   thats dedication
Just remeber to regularly make backups 😊
incredibile
Wunba on top
exactly like mogswanmp
Brp the ammpunt of time and effort he puts in his videos is insane like 5.3million sand??!
I am so happy to see that I was on the footage of the stream! So grateful! It was such a great series! keep up the good work!
Respect to the chicken 🫡🫡🫡
No way bro rickrolled me in 2024
9:34 I have no plan
bro is loyal to his fans EPIC vid!
I mean the last time i was testing TNT in minecraft it only crashed my game/the server i was on.. but sure if u say so (meaning i was using a plugin named WORLD EDIT to change a large portion of the map in TNT) frying ur GPU/Motherboard seems a bit unreal to say the least (even if u let the Minecraft on and waiting for the full explosion)
Plot twist: he died in the explosion
Pretty sure the song will be never gonna give you up.
man quit literally nuked his pc several times
Yooo let’s go another videooo!!!!
Ppl didn't realize that they got rickrolled lol😂
that was EPIC
I instantly knew you where going to rickrolle us when you said that you was going to meke some music.
When he whispers the items/blocks he's getting, he just saying never gonna give you up
sleep
I have waited this video for so long FINALLY it's out🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
you are my new favorite youtuber
35:56 Ok, but did you get a set of blast protection armor?
That isnt accurate nuke, that is a PC lag test
minute 41:09 why is your hotbar blurred?
I will  do 10 pushups for every like this comment gets!
just so you know at the point where kilotons turn to the thousands we call it megatons for every 1,000 kilotons therefore you made a bomb with the blast force of 2 megatons which is over 10x stronger than hiroshima nagasaki and the oppenheimer bomb combined
You are crazyyy🎉🎉🎉😂
Absolutely fantastic video! One of the most creative Minecraft videos I’ve ever seen!
Congrats on 1 mil Wunba! Wish I could get the poster haha 🥲
Rickroll
Did he die??????????????
2:57 those who know💀
He nuked his house by creating a nuke in a pixel game
Idk what to say boom boom i guess
I never knew you were a cuber
dont end hardcore world plz
You are truly an Inspiration Man, i can not mention my gratitude to you through words, i literally shaking at that very end and it was really worth every single second what i watched and experienced. It was just a true piece of Art and God damn ridiculous effort and time you put in so that we can experience this "ONE OF ITS KIND CONTENT".  Truly appreciate and Congratulate you for what you have achieved till now. Just Amazing 💙 Love you man Really Hat's off to you 👍
openwunba
He said never gonna give you up.
It’s very sad how he censored his feet while he was walking 😢
Okay how does wunba literally explode a bomb 130 tomes more powerful that the first atomic bomb in a video game and still use shaders without crashing? But he crashed placing blocks??? Maybe wunba is God?
10:05 bro just rick roll us very hard 😂😂😂😂😂
the chicken😢
32:40 I love how he censored the feet
I wil do 1 push up for 10 likes mayby to 2.12.2024
Rip al the animals and villagers that dief in the explosion like the frog and chickens
New favorite rick roll mechanism unlocked
This Man Is Crazy And That's Why I Love Watching Him..❤❤
Wow
I saw all your live streams of this project
the PC will be the irl bomb.
Very nice vedio 😊
bro you alive in ur hardcore world???
Imagine frying a PC by using Autoclicker too much!!! XD XD XD
Bro rickrolled us at 44:07
I like that he added the oppenheimer soundtrack quantum physics
did you survived ?
Bro just rickrolled all of us and nobody realised that...
Did you just rick roll us???????
the grand oppenheimer season 2
TARRRR BBBBOOOOMMMMMMMMMBBBBBBAAAAAA
No way he rickrolled us 10:03
i think that this probably one of the if not the best minecraft video i’ve ever seen 🤯
This was godly, I watched some of your streams! I had the same freezing problem, you helped me fix it
What auto clicker?
i just gotta say, where is cloosingheimer?
babe wake up new wunba video just dropped
bro woke up and chose to become a Minecraft Oppenheimer
If anyone can help by saying how does he get a list of that items and the blueprint of farms?
Did you survive? You never showed us
That RickRoll was absolutely legendary! I wasn't expecting it one bit, you got me so good
37:33 not accusing u of anything, but what msg is blurred out down there it looks like the msg that u get when a player joins or leaves a server not accusing u of anything tho js wanna know 😅
I would love to know how many hours you have on minecraft!!!
@CastCrafter du bist da
Do you support Palestine?
Plot Twist: He died
Jesus loves us all, he gave his life to save us from sin and rose to defeat death so that we may have life, please give your lives to him, he loves you!❤️
Imagine lightning struck the tnt as he was building it😂
No way bro just ricked us in the million sub special, i didnt even have to go back and check again i just know its rick
Just buyed the poster :)
9:50 not the rick roll :C
After this you should  build  the backrooms 😂
That is so crazy!!! Congrats on 1.13 Million subscribers! That is dedication!
you could also just put 1 shulker with each shulker
Never gonna give you up
you are the best
Dude not backing up your world before doing this is flat out foolish. Think of how it fried everything just from PLACING tnt… If you hadn’t uploaded a backup to patreon, the BLAST alone would’ve absolutely destroyed your computer.
no bc why he kinda..
1:18 i love how almost every hardcore youtuber just has a random huge pit dug out in the ground
Big cheers!
It's kindof your own fault for losing your world after your second ssd crash. Why would you not make a backup of your files? Was first scare not be enough of a warning?
Wunba please help, I’m about half way done building your storage room in my world, I realized that the schematic doesn’t copy over where the non placeable items go. Is there a way I can see pictures of yours so I can easily know what goes into the item frames, if not I’m gonna have to see what items will fit with the space given, PLEASE HELP
Wunba did anyone ever told you that you're insane(in a good way)?
Next the biggest tent in minecraft hardcore witttt🙄😮😮😮😮😮
Rit
Rig bohin you is the fine to balid the farland
Bro something similar happened to me. I turned off my pc for the night, and the next day, woke up to a blue screen. I was able to recover some files but not everything unfortunately. To make things worse, not too long after, my iPad randomly turned off in the middle of me using it, and it never turned on again. I lost so much with no chance of recovering it.  Also, does your old domino channel still exist? I’d love to watch it!
One like for the chicken who set of all the TNT 😂
the fact that he had to blur his feet really shows how thirsty the internet is💀
Heiko CastCrafter❤️❤️
How you even came up with this long chain reaction?
32:37 I love how he blurred his feet 😭 Edit: Don't ask why I was looking there
Loved how the guy used the Oppenheimer theme song
luv u jason <3
❤️
Bro has the bulkiest pc ive ever heard of, my bro got nasa to sponsor him or something
bro became mr beast
I have a lot of tnt in mine, wunba.  I have 5,000,000 tnt. I’m waiting till I have enough :)
Reference to The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel, Book 6?
id i really just get rickrolled? ehh
Why does a dolphin need water breathing points
4:34 bro just lost 2k levels
What u have against @Skavio XDDD
I am the one piece that explodes
Basicly this is that one guy who does all the things so you don't have to.
Lookin good wunba, great video, and your skin looks great to :D
When i see i moved the like count from 4.6k to 4.7k THE POWER:(\__/)                                                                                                                     (*.*) Okay no seriously i actually did.
This feels like a Mr Beast video
Impressive ! Maybe you could challenge CastCrafter to top your 1,3mln TNT
is there a video of the actual explosion? all that work and we didnt even see the best part... (not meant to be negative, was just really looking forward to the actual explosion)
How the heck did your pc calculate 1.3 million tnt?
i was a fan before but after this masterpiece, i am a whole air conditioner.
The Rick roll at 10 minutes 😂😂💀
Blud really Rick rolled us 10:06
I SAW THAT RUBIK'S CUBE! What kind is it? Is it a gan cube, rubik's brand, what kind?
that poor chicken
Why’d you censor your feet 💀
i was watching ur vids for like less than a week (and it usually takes me longer to subscribe) but this vid? im 21 minutes in and i hit the subscribe button (and also decided to try minecraft myself one more time, thanks man)
//wand 213 312 100 1 tnt easy wr
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Did he rickroll us?
You should have made the flag of the USA
I’m an OG, bro
That was worth it man
10:03 bro rick rolled us
i love you wunba i would like to play with you if you will play with me i have no mic and im on TLauncher it would be a honor to play with a god...
this video inspired me to start making backups of my world on a usb lmao. my world isnt nearly as impressive as yours nor is it on hardcore but its still my baby  awesome video, your whole channel inspired me to start doing bigger projects in my world and im having more fun with mc now than i have in the past decade.
lmao the rickroll got me so hard
THIS WAS THE COOLEST VIDEO I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! SERIOUSLY, WUNBA, YOU ARE SUCH A FANTASTIC CREATOR ❤❤
and i'll become death and destroyer of the world-words by lord krishna(the ultimate deity) in epic mhabharata....
hi
OMG THIS LOOKS AMAZING!!!
best video I have ever seen
Bro spend so much money for motherboard and ssd for a minecraft explosion! He never gonna give up! Wunba best! (No Rick Roll) 👇
10:03 that's the sneakiest rickroll that i have ever seen
First 1mill subscriber special that actually feels special towards the fans I'm new but can't lie this Is a MASSIVE W
rickrolled
Why is it that youtubers ssds always like to corrupt? Also, love the Ruth Goldberg machine!
Hi
The editing is top notch
W delivery driver
WHY RICK ROLL?!?!!?!
You deserve the million
He is death, the true destroyer of PCs and money.
he rly managed to rickroll us in a mc vid
37:33 What is that WUMBA?? Why did U blur the text/command?
This video is so cool I could never do this even in a normal survival world❤
gonna watch this masterpiece after exams
Bro realy pulled a Hiroshima moment
24:35 I love making dominoes too
So I was curious about this so I did some math! Doing some quick research, several people have done calculations and the most precise I could find (using the actual density of tnt) puts Minecraft tnt at a weight of around 1,650 kg (about 2 lbs) this is 1.65 metric tons (explosives are typically measured in tons of tnt) multiplying this 1.65 by the 1,331,000 tnt Wunba is going to place you get 2,196,150 tons of tnt. Converting this to megatons, you get 2.19615 megatons, lets just round this up to 2.2 mt. For some context, the Gadget, Fat Man, and Little Boy were all measured in terms of KILOtons, you don’t typically start getting into MEGAtons until you get to explosions like those caused by a Super. So yes, Wunba has made a bomb more powerful than most atomic bombs! (Bonus: according to the nukemap website, this put Wunbas weapon somewhere between the B-83 and the R-12 (SS-4) in terms of power)
dang we got rickrolled
The new editor is 🔥
This has to be the best 1 million sub special ever
1:20
Mr beast is poop
GG, wow.
every tnt litteraly representing every subscriber it is really an honor for us
And this, ladies and gentlemen and those who have transcended the need for such labels, is why backups are a blessing.
not only did Wunba  give us a moment in Hardcore History, he rickrolled everyone not once, but twice., I loved watching the streams and seeing this come together!
If you gona do this every milion subscribers imagine you have the same emouth as Mr Beast😅☠️💣🤯
How did you avoid the appearance of vexes on the raid farm?
Wunbas whole channel is a lesson on how good planning is the difference between the 0.01% and the rest of us.
poor chicken
what autoclicker does bro use💀i need it
Plz give me heart wunba😢
I will blow one tnt every like this comment gets
everyone’s making videos today
#castcrafter reagiere
I think it’d be super wholesome after all of these insane, time consuming, mesmerising, literally record breaking projects for Wunba’s next video to be a regular minecraft video. Just going mining, doing some farming, going on an adventure, building a humble house and going fishing. A very well deserved vacation, returning to the roots of what made us all fall in love with the game, which led to this man putting on a spectacle with every upload.
WOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!! Let`s GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO And I SUBSCRIBED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🧨🧨
Bro really rickroled us 💀
it’s sad you lost the world
NO! WHY DID YOU FIRE YOUR OLD EDITOR!
wumbanhimer lol
man... this was incredibly inspiring, great job on 1 million subscribers you definitely deserve it man,  also good job on the rick rolls that was great!
i hope you didnt die XD
Early gang   👇
Who"s like me watching Minecraft but you can"t play it(       and I"m not begging for anything)
i just automatically knew it was a rickroll ever since he placed the first note block and mentioned "copyrighted music"
You were that domino guy I used to watch thanks for the memory dude. 😀😀😀
New Name Unlocked: Wunbaheimer
10:17 was crazy
why didn't he say if he survived it?
10:00  Never gonna give you up
Wow. this was... EPICCCCCCC. This was AMAZING. I can't believe the amount of work you put into this! Also the fact that Wuba rickrolled us in the chain reaction-
CC ❤
Wunba might be the only person in the entire minecraft community who loves the word "HOPPERS"
WTH, I just realized wunba only has 1.1 mill subs, So damn underrated bro 😢
an absolute masterpiece !
Congratulations wumba 🎉👏
When you lose one drive you would think it would motivate you to keep backups lol
Big W for delivery guy Jason
I saw my self as minecraft tnt ilike if you are to❤❤
turtle master potions would've worked
I solved the Gordon knot
That was insane Wunba just doesn't give up, also congrats on 1 million subscribers!
I never seeing something so awesome at least you still have your hardcore world fun to watch.
For every pushup i get i will do 1 like
Bro i knew it was gonna be a rickroll
Babe wake up! New Wunba just dropped!
🗿 Wunba
Been waiting a couple months
How do you have 1 mil subs but there’s only 6k views dude I don’t get it 😭😭😭
videos so cool congrats on 1mil🎉
Did I just get rick rolled by Wunba?
Starting off 2024 with a bang? lol ❤
I absolutely love the new editing style
today i will split the atom in minecraft
You will never know how much like this comment get for no reason
cast crafter
The new editor is fire
and again he never fails to satisfy us!
Are you dead??
I must do a push up for each replie i get
I know that "american mategrends" (however you spell it) screen because i use linux (fails, crashes, deletes its self every 2 seconds), and that's the screen that you get if you don't have a bootloader (a small binary that loads your computer) and i thought your boot option (the computer's knowledge of where the bootloader file is) from your UEFI / BIOS (thing that connects your software to your hardware) got deleted, but the entire ssd got deleted (from the computer's perspective ofc).                                                                              **I dont think you know what anything i just said means lol**
I cannot express how this inspired me I had a 2 year old hardcore world and I lost it I had given up I didn't play minecraft anymore but this video inspired me to try again. Thank You :)
Congrats for the World Record. That was such an epic video. Keep up the good work
Thought you were in the TNT block lol. 13:48
Bro rickrolled us am I the only one who saw that 10:04 lol
Finally I've been waiting for so long.
your editing is insane
just imagine if a creeper exploded and set it all off
did i get rickrolled twise?
BEST MINECRAFT YOUTUBER IN HISTORY 👍
This isn't Minecraft content anymore, It has become a movie production 🔥🔥🔥🫡🫡🫡 Idk how much u will earn... But this deserve $ 200k+
I want to know how the computer fixer looks like when he gave the PC back again 💀
Touch grass? Nah imma pass
I just hope He makes a backup in case it crashes
I love that random moments on YouTube its so cinematic!❤
WUNBA SB COLLAB
Hi sb737
YOU RICKROLLED US 15:10 >:(
Good job Jason
you can gust make an auto crafter with auto crafters, need auto crafter auto crafters, need help, ask mumbo, he did it
That was the best minecraft  video ive seen
Rückroll was predictable
1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 percent pure tanlent
The farlands were 12.550.828 block out of spawn. And a 1.17 snapshot adder the farlands back.🤔
Would you get world rakod
9:58  and HOPpers and HOPpers
:)
No did he die
the only thing which will turn into a nuke is his cpu
No way he rickrolled us
Dude just RickRolled us twice
what is blue print of the raid farm
If u like my comment I’ll do 100 push ups WUNBA and shout your name 1000 times
God this is not a video, it's a full blown movie🔥🔥🔥
Hundreds of hours of work to build a huge tnt is pure dedication!
This should appear in the next minecraft live Edit: it MUST
Epic grind! Epic plot twist! Was pleasure to watch! But too bad you blurred your feet 😁
totally worth the wait
This video is a real blast 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"If I had a nickel for every time a cool Minecraft youtuber compared blowing up a huge amount of tnt to a past channel of theirs where they did domino chains, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but its weird that it happened twice" -Doofenshmirtz (Also, shoutout to Mogswamp)
imagine a creeper snuk inside the shell ☠☠☠☠☠
NOOOO! I fell for the rickroll
i don't know man, but placing 66 blocks per second seems like a solid recipe for frying your own hard drive 😅
To the people who keep Wunba in their basement: *don't let him out*
wow.. just wow
He made whit 1,3M tnt blocks a nuke of his pc
how would you get 64 stacks of eggs at 29:52??
I got rickrolled in 2024 😂❤
The first ever thing that made conduit useful
40:17 hell nah bro
I'm watching this while testing the temp on my dslr.. so everytime you use the transition for the camera shutter sound.. I get worried :D lmao  Great vid so far mate :D  Edit: OMG YOU WAS THE DOMINO GUY O_O
When the pizzaman is the biggest chad.
boom.
Obviusly a rickroll is never out place
This is legendary....
Love the video ❤😊
Amazing video ❤😊
Bro really said "shout out to Oppenheimer for the idea" 💀
ALL THOSE SAFETY MEASURES COULD’VE BEEN ONE-UPPED BY STANDING FAR ENOUGH AWAY AND HAVING A COUPLE TOTEMS COME ON
10:15 i might have gotten rickrolled...
cant believe i just got rick rolled bruh
gravity block duper link?
That was so big!!! Great video!!
the real bomb is his pc 😭😭
Best video ever❤❤
WTF
Forget what the other dude said, ill do 1 pushup every like this comment gets. I need it anyway 😊
My man, considering the sheer scale and mental strain/amount of effort you have to go through for these projects... a video every month or so is NOT THAT BAD, Don't put yourself down.  Also congrats on One Million, super happy for you
Finally another wunba video yay
I won’t do anything if you like the comment.
this 40-minute video felt like in 10 minutes because how engaging it was, keep up the work wunba your videos are just absolutely amazing and never fail to entertain! :)
Haven’t watched the video yet, but I see the pinned comment giving a thanks to Jason and Oppenheimer, oh boy Wunba what did you do?
What a big boi blast that was
DUDE! YOU RICKROLLED US! 10:05 (started rick rolling)
would be nice to alert on the screen earlier about flash images but nice vid!
So did you died or not ??
Wunba is the best🤣
I love how when  wunba uses film music in his videos. It just makes it so much more epic!!🔥
나는 당신의 노력과 열정을 공감한다. 정말 멋진일이야 브로
oh my god... this is just insane... bro you are like the MrBeast of Minecraft. It is just insane.
I will do something every like the vid gets / this comment
never gonna give you up
Hey I’m commenting on this video for the second time and am watching this it now hope it’s good
this video is so well made
Nolan is searching for wunba 😂😂
Did he survive
bruh literally said let me cook
What an incredible video 🙌 well done🎉
I will do absolutely nothing for every push up this like gets!
He Rick rolled us.
1 hour since the video is out and only 1k views
Do you survive ?
0:00 Let's rewatch!
I absolutely LOVE rube goldberg machine and this has to be one of the coolest ones that I’ve seen!!! Amazing job Wunba! Congrats on over 1 million subscribers, it’s well deserved!!!
you should have destroy the waters.
This is crazy. Congratulations Wunba 🎉
The tnt explosion was too small. Try again :/
Wunba rocked 🎊🎊🗿🗿🗿🗿
This is for sure the best video I've actually ever seen containing minecraft content
THAT WAS CRAZY!!! But did you survive?
Didn't even get to see the crater
we waited for this so long, i personally saw every single community post related to the 1 mil special
babe wake up wunba just ended WW2
The Wunbinheimer actually goes hard 🔥🔥
Fabulous just amazing
This video was actually amazing
he's a menace at hardcore
WUNBINHEIMER was so good!
Holy cow this was wild!! So much effort but it was SO worth it! Also I found it funny that every irl clip that accidentally showed your feet you blurred out 😂😂
Great job wunba. Love you 🙃💗
Wunba always had his priorities set for Rickrolling us first, The nuclear bomb comes second
Is he still alive
Biggest complaint with the video, is that you barely showed the aftermath
🔥
Insane
DID HE DIE?
Bro 😎 really Rick rolled me what a Chad🗿
He said it: I am tnt, destroyer of world. 🎉🎉🎉🎉
We getting out of Hiroshima with this one🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It looks like someone was taking bites out of the tnt pile
Be robloxian pls i
Pin
I got rickrolled
Wow
I knew it was the rickroll and I loved the chain reaktion too
THIS is when it blew up in the premiere
I was actually vibing with the music until I realised
Could have just used a Flint and Steel...
Castcrafter just saw this
Amazing work.  Cant wait to see what is next!!  You are awesome =33
Bruh
14:50 bro literally rick rolled us😂😂
How are you placing 66 blocks per second? You can only do a meaningful action in minecraft 20 times per second, so how are you placing like 3.5 times faster?
You don't pay rent
Wunba censored his feet because he knows someone would get a kick out of it lmao
How big is this video
babe wake up new wunba video
ok
Im gonna do every pushups every comment this like gets ( XD)
I will do 1 push ups for every like
Is that what you call easy? •_•
I think I’ve seen one of those domino videos before

Was that a Domino’s Pizza guy?
The pc self sabotaged because it didnt want to be blown up
The scaffolding PFPFPFPFPF😲😲😆😆😂😂😃😃
😮
Not too expensive
He’s going to end up dying
bro what kind of autoclicker do you use ?
Wunba just rickrolled us while building storage for sand
Hello wunba, I have an idea 4. Your hardcore world rebuilds every removed structure in minecraft, and don't forget the nostalgic maps like dropper and minecraft tutorial world
Your commitment to your projects is awesome 👏
1 hour gang!👇
Love the new editor
Now I have became TNT, the destroyer of computers
It's a gud day today
Yey
15:09 And this was the moment I knew Rick Astley was here.
Who all got Rick rolled
Bro Rick rolled us in ASMR 💀💀💀
Secret Rick roll😂
HOPPERS
Sussyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy baka
bro is so rich he used emerald blocks under the porta
The Editing, the mc world, let alone recording the entire video along with working on the project proves how much you've exhausted yourself just to simply entertain every single one of your subscribers. Great Work! 🔥👍
