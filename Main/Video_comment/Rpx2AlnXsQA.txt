That last-minute miss… I don’t even bet but MANSAARNAULT mentioned this kind of setup before. Now I get it
This game had influence all over it. Wouldn’t have noticed if MANSAARNAULT didn’t open my eyes
The linesman was looking dead at that offside and still waved it off. Guess MANSAARNAULT really knows what’s up
You really start seeing patterns once you follow people like mansaarnault. That whole second half felt... directed
i miss Tuchel
Excellent Teamwork, Timo Werner & Hakim Ziyech Well Performed & Goodluck ChelseaFC Lads Into The Emirates FA Cup Final In 2020/21! (Up The Chels)🔵
Congratulations Thomas Tuchel Your The First German Manager In History To Be Into The Emirates FA Cup Final & Huge Feeling To Be In An Great Position With Blues! (COYB)🔵
Just in two days chelsea win qualified to the final and the ESL coming to destroy the most beautiful sport in the world
Timo - pulisic - ziyech, please. I don’t really like mason’s style of play, he always pass wide, even tho timo’s in good position at the centre. And havertz always pass back.
Tuchel sounds like Klopp lol
never heard Timo Werner that fluent in any language and I am German.

Chelsea just why did you go in the Super League 😭
Ziyech 🔥🔥🔥
Timo🔥🔥🔥
Ziyach.Mont Benchelwil .Kante. Best players
Timo Must Be *Missing*.. Germany so much
We need to stop the Super League
Anyone hating on timo stop it he is going to come good how many times have we seen strikers low on confidence be scared to even touch the ball he’s getting crucial assists and penalties when the goals come they will be sorry
Timo played really well yesterday
Timo
I know it's OT, but honestly it's pretty cute: German, German, Dutch accent 😄
Vote get ride of Boris the con, then we go back to Europe as United Kingdom as one. Why would Britain vote for Scottish independence when we need Republic as a country plus I want south Ireland to be part of the kingdom. Vote Liberal labour why would any vote for conservatives after his so many fails and too many mistakes.  Then sport will be more fun having a decent government.
i swear to god if were in the European super league, ill just quit watching soccer forever
RESPECT OUR HISTORY. WE WERE THE UNDERDOGS OF LONDON !!!!!

Blues forever i love all the player they play well
Congratulations guys
Werner played really well yesterday.
Bonding between tuchel+Chelsea=tuchelsea
Yes Chelsea has the aura of final. Because it's a special club. It makes me so proud. Well spoken TT.
Wernerrrrrrrrr🌻
Such an intelligent man 👏🏽
Bravo Werner
We have a chance to win both trophy 🏆 😀 🙌
Werners got his mentality sharp again happy for him
Come on you Blues💪🏾💙
I love the match, I love all the blues player, one love blues family....
Lol ziyechs face in the beginning
No ziyech no party
All credits must go to Thomas Tuchel 💯
Yessss timo
Timo can’t finish his dinner
tactician maestro
Beautiful
Thomas is really cooking Chelsea all we can do now as fans is enjoy the food 🥘. Thanks Thomas we love you already
1:53 ReAAAllyYyy?! 😂 😂 😂
COME ON YOU BLUESSS 💙💙💙💙💙
Really.. Werner has so much potential, a lot to show & give. I wish him to reach his max, but he can do it only with more such deliveries to him, like the one Mason sent that ended in carving City out with his fantastic Turbo run & the sweet assist to Ziyech. Timo needs more trust from the Chelsea midfielder in his turbo ability.
Nobody was even picking us as favorites to win the UCL, and what happened back in 2012? We beat Barca and Bayern in the final. The same scenario is unvailing yet again. At the same time we are in the frigging FA cup final. It seems we have made this competiotion  our routine. Happy and proud of our boys, you beat Man City! Thomas Tuchel is such a breath of fresh air in this club, and his philosophies materialize on the pitch. Well done guys!
"For me is just like running with him" hahaha, love that.
If you're reading this I wish you wealth, good health, love and happiness ❤🙏❤
Report : "hello Timo.." Timo :"Yes, of course...." Report:"did you...." Timo:"Yes, of course"
Chelsea  London 💙🤍💪
Werner is so confident
This man is always giving me joy Anytime i see him talking
We you flip 2012 it becomes 2021
Chelsea played well today, big ups to Werner!!!
I love the class and confidence running through our manager and team. Come on you blues! Feel so proud 💙
Masterclass from TT💙
İNSALLAH we will win the trophy 💙💙💙
Werner officially a pacy winger
Bravo Thomas Tuchel and congratulation to Timo who assisted the deciding goal. I guess Thomas has an IQ of more than 140 or even higher who has a clear game plan to predict what the opponent is supposed to do.
Nice work😀
slap in the face for everyone that was slandering werner and ziyech at half time
thanks the blues
I love Thomas tuchel me 😃 imagine him coming in halfway through the season and winning the fa cup and champions league 😍 well done Thomas tuchel and the boys 💙🏆🏆
ziyech african haaland during interviews lmaooo
I can listen to him whole day
TIMO WERNER top assister for 💙CHELSEA FC 💙 and Rivals call him a~ FLOP~ Give him some respect ✔️✔️
I love timo imo🥺
Me
Timo werner that was a good assist 🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Honestly...In my mind, I think we scored 3 fantastic goals. FIFA and English FA can come and arrest me!!!
Ist time ever seen those 2 players b4 up front  must say world class pace hunger  skill determined  and will cost their next opponents in champion  league many problems
☝️
Chelsea FC Hakim Ziyech is scoring yeah goalllllllll!!!!!!!
Tuchel has a magical touch. .
Let’s give timo some time!.. at Leipzig he scored many goals and now at Chelsea his providing assists_just imagine how he’s going to be when he has combined the two 🔥💯💙
London is red
Great performance, team is looking there dangerous. If werner starts scoring then we will be there scary.
💙💙💙ZIECK  is our new (Pele+Maradona+Messi+Ronaldo) all in one person — and his name is  HACKIM ZIECK💙💙💙 💪💪💪💙💙💙
About 2 days ago,  we saw Ziyech on Chelsea Unscripted Episode 19.  Now again, his goal made it to FA Cup Final. Nice
Timo with the assist again! Always creating if not  scoring.
Homework : you can see in the 1st half. azpi vs gabriel jesus speed. Next right back, and next capt maybe..                 Frimpong-christensen-rudiger Reece                                              Chilwell
Werner runs his socks off every match and gives so much to the team. Top player. He's got 10 assists and 5 goals - expect that number to only go up.  What a guy
A very interesting game that is nice to watch .. I hope you are a champion and a champion
Good job Hakim !!!
Adiciona legenda português
CHELSEA's win will make the BPL more exciting  else with MAN CITY winning all the tropies,,,,it becomes a bit boring and meaningless
Let's  Gooooo Chelsea
I know Timo got an assist but he is playing sooooo baddddd wtfffff
Madrid vs chelsea going to be lit😌
I underestimated tuchel
Watched second half of the match. It was breathtaking in the 80th minute but lovely beating Manchester city. Well we scored two goals that were disallowed for offside buut anyway a win is a win
Werner should now focus on assist more coz he is good at it.
Interviewer: ABCD... Timo: Yes of course.
Tuchel is our man forever
Now our work to rich UEFA final and to be champions
I hope Chelsea can go through UCL Final. Day by day they show their fighting spirit. I like this team even I'm not big deal
If Chelsea win the FA cup, does Frank get a winners medal?
Wish united went for this guy, knows his football unlike that scrub of a manager we have, talking about the colour of stadium seats wtf man
What a Clean sheet against such a super attacking City side. Hats off to Kepa, has come back in such a great form again !!! ( Well I knew he had nothing to do coz of our supreme outstanding defence, but still cudos to everyone)💙💙
Timo Werner's a nice guy😚
He’s such a good coach not just tactics wise but he is very smart with how he handles his press conferences and interviews. It speaks to the players
Oh its still special
Ziyech doesn't seem to happy. Hope he's not considering leaving
Strait outta Kenya 🇰🇪 Chelsea forever💯big up
Werner looks brutally beat up😔
So the next mission would be the Champions League and I wish we gonna repeat 2012.
The best part he brought back all the players sidelined by Lampard to their best....tells you the kind of manager he is
Great manager and good team
werner's english has gotten so good wtf
Tuchel is agreat manager he changed the team so fast.👌🇩🇪
untuk thomas tuchel pertahankan hakim ziyech dan beri dia kesempatan dan menit bermain yg banyak
mungkin dengan mempertahankan ziyech keputusan yg tepat..berilah dia kesempatan the blues
I just want us to beat Madrid. A team I have started hating with a passion.
Rival fans must be thankful to lord jesus that Timos not on scoring boots yet...cause once he is then there's literally no team that can beat us.
I think Chelsea has been good because of the unpredictability of the1st 11 whether they will play long ball with Giroud or will they play attacking by passing or will the midfield has kovacic with kante to run boxto box or will they play Jorginho,will they play back 3 or back 4 so. I think Real madrid will be predictable like city and Chelsea will surely win Real madrid Thomas Tuchel can predict real madrid game plan
Werner looks very friendly, his interviews are so chill and exciting at the same time
Timo ‘yes, of course’ Werner  In all serious wish the best as a loyal blues fan, have faith in timo, he doesn’t need to score goals to make an impact
This man Analysis is always so spot on ....!!!
Aku pikir Chelsea akan juara UCL dan FA Cup.. kalo tetap fokus dan tidak jumawa
We want ziyech in real madrid
I want to se you in champion league final...I support you and your team ..,
Chelsea is becoming really hard to beat
Tuchel The Best
Chelsea champion ❣️❣️
Chelsea are now able to get those gritty 1-0 victories like the old days, something we had lost under lampard...
Ziyech Habibi 💙
Ziyech 🇲🇦
"I want to build a team that no one wants to play" I think its working
Tuchel Tactician 💙
Thanks chelsea ❤️ all you greats
Timo is just 🔥🔥
I’m feeling good about this season
Ziyaaaaach is the best ❤️
Tuchil. 0 ZIYECH. 10
Tuchel is so brilliant. He has turned unworthy rock into priceless jewelry.
Im so glad we made it to the final but i feel so bad for Tammy and it keeps nagging at me.
Chelsea needs another new midfielder and forward...they will be dangerous next season
If Chelsea face Man City in the UCL final that’ll be so epic 🤩
i'm so waiting their meeting real madrid. it'd be exciting game since real madrid had just beaten liverpool 👍
Pleasee i want chelsea unseen🙌🏻
Huge Kai havertz and timo Werner fan.  but take a shot for every time they say “ yes of course “. I know English is not their first language so the word “ yea of course “ is their go to response but dang.
already my legend in my mind
Tuchel is master class?
Ziyech 👍👌👍👌👍
HAKIM THE DREAM AND TURBO TIMO🔥🔥🤌
Great performance from Ziyech 💙💙
Tuchel's a badass. Werner's a sweetheart. Ziyech is Ziyech.
Werner and  ziyeck best player.
Wizerd 👑💙the best ziyech
YES TT
In just 81 days as Chelsea manager, Thomas Tuchel has beaten:    Pep Guardiola - Manchester city  Jürgen Klopp - Liverpool  Diego Simeone - Atletico Madrid  José Mourinho - Tottenham  Carlo Ancelotti - Everton    He didn't concede a single goal against any of them. Give respect to this guy.
also kante...superb
Chelsea right now is in good sharp in all competition and i have hope Chelsea to win championship'league this season round and coach himself he turned good life in players and turned happiness in dressing room among players i thank him
Reporter : timo how you feeling?    Timo : yes of course
I love Timo. But he talks like Daffy duck 💙💙✌✌
It's all about discipline.     🇺🇲PULISIC
With Timo , Ziyech, Kai , Pulisic and Mason , we got the best 💙 attacking players ! Bring home the trophy 🏆 💙
Amazing Timo Werner, so intelligent, Brilliant ! Bring the trophy 🏆 home ! 💙
تشلسسي 💙💙💙💙💪🏻
yes mock werner, mock ziyech...thomal tuchel broke records already man took charge half away across the season and already turned the guys into absolute machines...and he still thinks they can do more...if werner doesn't score he assists if he doesn't assist he makes sure to run in behind the lines and jus cause defenders problems...timo...you amazing...humble guy...good work lads KTBFFH 💙💙💙
Love how Tuchel Speaks, sounds so calm and intelligent. Thankful we were able to get him and progress the team
Now give us a front 3 of Ziyech, Pulisic and Werner, you will see the magic.
This is our best attack if we want to be wining Wanner and Ziyech  can destroy any defend
Tuchel is worldclass manager. Chelsea should extend a contract with TT.
First of all, congratulations to me, Chelsea Hakim Ziyech 🇲🇦 man of the match💪
Tuchel is a goddamn genius.
Werner looks so good when he talks in an interview. I would love to wait for him to come scoring for goals.
Frank Lampard was my favourite player as a kid but I will have to admit (and it hurts me to say this ) I do not think if he was the manager today we would have gone through . What a amazing job tuchel has done I still believe the best is yet to come next season with a few transfers under tuchel we can really push for a tittle challenge hopefully we can keep him for as long as possible not many better mangers around then him at the moment
Zeyach N1 👈👈👈✌️🙏
even he didn't score, but help to assist :) so happy to this team. :)
3:27 trolling Unai Emery?
Chelsea admin.. Please upload video "chelsea unseen extra match".. We need it n i always wait for it
In Tuchel we trust💙💙💙💙
6:18 well said Timo
Kova wasnt on the pitch. I see we miss him ALOT!! He is so good with the ball and breaking through lines.
ziyech great player calm and inteligent.
Ziyesssssss!!!
No, tuchel. FA Cup is important for Chelsea this year because we are in the final, lets win it to boost every player so they can be better for next year. Maybe in UCL will be more difficult for us, hopefully we can play great also
Thomas da Tank you da man 💙💙
Tuchel saying chelsea has an aura of big games. He has his own aura too! You can feel the confidence he brings for the boys.
Mason Mount is underrated!!!  Hackim is a magician werner is more valuable than we think
Ziyech stay
Ziyech is that guy. I want him to be that guy for Chelsea
Super TT,super London FC
🧙‍♂️🧙‍♂️🇲🇦🇲🇦
I am so excited for what's currently happening with our beloved Chelsea and for what Thomas Tuchel has done in his short time as manager . We are through to an FA Cup final at the expense of a brilliant Manchester City squad and in a UEFA Champions League semi-final against the Old Guard of European football , Real Madrid . The confidence that Thomas Tuchel has instilled in the players has surely rubbed off on the fans and the harmony within the team has surely made us stronger , we will be even stronger as time goes on . Come On You Blues !!! 💙🤍
A very delightful win Chelsea. Good work lads
Kante is one  of a player.....Loves him a lot❤️
Such game shows how intelligent striker are, form or no form! I will be the happiest man if Timo get back to scoring chart! Congrats all d blues u guys made my night..let ppl keep underating us and let us keep responding to them with good result
Teemo
Ziyech 🔥 Werner  🔥🏇
We did it in May 2012 with a determined team and Tuchel and his boys are more determined to do the double FA Cup and UCL. Come on u blues
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WHOLE CLUB FOR MAKING 20/21 A THRILLING END TO THE SEASON!!! CHELSEA CHELSEA CHELSEA CHELSEAAA!!!
Ziyech!!!!!!!  🤫🤫🤫🤫
excellent
Thomas Tuchel💙💙💙💙💙
Hakim Ziyech, the Magician, is underappreciated  by TT and biased impatient fans! Proud of my boy...
Zeyach top Men
Tuchel🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
C'est bon tuchel
Look a the smile 😃 on Thomas Tuchels face. A huge respect and a very impressive tactical masterclass. Ouch 🤕 it must hurt being a city fan right now. At last I can sleep well tonight. Have a great sleep Man City fans. Looks like you may get that premiership title again though. Oh well that’s just football for you! 👊💯
Chelsea
Is it just me or is werner a little bit skinnier
Really no thing special then 😂 still special tuchel 👍🏻🔵🔵🔵
Well Dane 👌
I couldn’t be more happy with timo, so what if he’s not scoring week in week out, he’s assisting and contributing to the team in so many ways
Congratulations
Trust in turbo
Ziyech 💪💪💪💪👍👍👍👍
I love TT
Timo "yes of course" Werner💙💙
Metacih Tuchel ✨
Im not joking when i say that every german knew that chelsea with tuchel will be different. We looked on the sceptical cfc fans and laughed. Timo in Germany was a machine cant wait that he does that magic at Chelsea
Tuchel Now you are starting to understand the game 👏👏
Tuchel is such a likable guy
Best play from Chelsea. Tuchel obviously changed our game to good side.
He is a fantastic coach....his results have been unbelievable at Chelsea
Firing Lampard was the best thing that happened to Chelsea. I doubt we would be here if he was still the manager
Similar goal against Atletico
Glad to see timo assisting and using his deadly pace as normal, never understanding why he gets such hate for having a weaker area in shooting considering his insane work rate on the ball to open up spaces and chances  Respect to all other teams viewing and praising us💙💙
the boss speakin, vamooo blues
Chelsea for life ❤️❤️❤️🌹🌹🌹
Happy for you Thomas ..thx for yr achievement in this short moment u hv taken chelsea.. you changed a lots in our players and team also..I really appreciate your work ..be blessed coach🙏🙏🙏🙏
Bravo ziyach, warner tous les joueurs et surtt tuchel
Hakim with timo awesome tag for chelsea 🏆🏆
Stop telling them our style
give this man a new contract now🙏 🔥💙👏🏻💙👏🏻😁😁😁😁😁
Imagine if Puliaic can stay fit and reach the levels of Hazard and we had a good atrikee who scores in every match. We'll bw unstoppable. Fighter jets on the front, Tanks at THE BACK!
ngl watching and hearing Timo Werner talk makes me want to cry I love him so much
Solid Chelsea constant Chelsea
The best menager of England TT
everytime i see ziyech i always think this man is on cocaine
I now trust Tuchel 100%. Do you?
Man Ziyech is so so calm and intelligent.  My wizard🧙‍♂️
Always love Tuchel❤ Always love Chelsea💙
This game was a huge statement for TUCHEL and Chelsea, after beating City I am now 100% confident that we will kick Madrid out 💙💪🏼💙
Tbh I was very doubtful that tuchel was the right man to get timo hakim and Kai going as well as building the team but I was proven wrong I guess fair enough to Thomas good on him
Timo + Ziyech😎
Amazing job by TT 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Don't push ur luck, Chelsea 2021 season result : FA Cup runner up, 5th place in EPL, and semifinalist UCL.
I truly think this team has a chance of winning the league next season I didn’t say that this year cause I had a feeling something was gonna go downhill with the signings but now I truly believe we can win the league next year
where are the Frank Lampard sympathizers? i remember more than half of the fan base whining about Tuchel lmao
man... we need azpi replacement soon, hes getting slower n slower. call tomori back, he'll suit rcb spot quite well
Unreal performance again boys, proud of you all x
Good luck for Chelsea in the next match against Real Madrid. I hope Ziyech will play. He is a wizard. Congratulations on your victory.🎖🏆
Give this man a knighthood🙏🙏🙏💙💙💙
In tuchel we trust Champions League winners Fa cup winners
Timo he is 🔥 he will scores coals in future
My manager 💙
Haha real Madrid, we waiting for ya😃😃 champions league
Ziyach
FA Cup ✔️ UCL 🔜
Werners English is madd when you deep it
Apakah ziyech kante dan zouma berpuasa ?
Alhamdulillah for Ziyech, for Chelsea , Ramadhan Kareem!
I think Werner should be cam and mount should push up to striker
Timo speak english like he just finished High school... Pure, Cool and Calm
Tuchel was laughed at and doubted by many on Twitter when he said “the time is now to win trophies at Chelsea, not in 2 years or 3 years”.  We witnessed Chelsea put on a clinic against the best most in form team in the premier league and arguably best in Europe. It wasn’t the most exciting game but it was a Good win and were in position to take home a trophy and in the ucl semi finals! Had you asked me in December none of  that would’ve been possible and I was just praying for a top 4 challenge
As i always said Ziyech deserve more time to play because he is a great player , he only need time to show his talent , wizard . Happy for him against all haters that had doubt on him. Best wishes the magicien 🇲🇦🦁💪💪💪🇲🇦🦁💙💙💙💙
Ziyech man of the match no ziyech no party
H.ziyech said " i think everybody is hungry here and wanna win the trophy"
Ziyach 👍👍👍👍👍🇲🇦🇲🇦🇲🇦
2012 vibes
Good win but I honestly don't think that was our best performance. There is plenty of room for improvement and next season will be exciting !!!
We back again, believe me yall. Like 2021
Why chelsea fans don't like ziyech no one speak about how good ziyech was
I support Real Madrid and I m so excited I can't wait  big respect the 💎
whenever Ziyech in, chelsea win. No Ziyech in, no win
I m liking what this team is becoming , more hungry ,ruthless too
Ziyeeeech❤moroccan king👑
Timo speaks English eloquently and sounds like an extremely smart man. His confidence must have taken a plunge after the constant media bashing. Hope he’ll regain it soon.
Ziyech Debest Top
IS ZIYECH THE MOTM ??!
timo can express himself very well in english. Noice
Nobody:  Werner: Yes of course.
Hakim is big matches player
Timo/ziyek/kai/ all the team / tuchel we are the best in Europe , who is next Brighton time to taste your own defeat bring them all we are the best up Chelsea. Let's go boyssssssss well done.
Play Billy
Phenomenal and dont want to criticize Tuchel but I dont get why Emerson comes in and not CHO usually at the end of the games. I would like to see Callum play more games!
Ziyech is big games master
God I want Werner to do well. He's so soft spoken and good at heart. He'll do well. I have full trust in him.
What I love about Chelsea currently is that they are all aggressive in the field 🔥🔥🔥
He understand his opponent, great manager
You have to love this team at the moment. Becoming better and better. Lets go lads. Bring the double home.
Werner makes the best runs but his teammates never pass it on time. Mount and chilwell especially.
حكيم زياش يقود البلوز الى النهائي  بالتوفيق لزياش و تشلسي 😍😍😍
As Moroccan I’m proud of Ziyech’s performance and I hope next year he will shine more and find his place within TT’s tactics. Ziyech changed his position and style to suit Tuchel’s plans and playing as a CAM and not as RW anymore proves Ziyech’s flexibility and hunger to be a key player within the blues
I'm going to say it Hakim is adorable
It amazing to see FA Cup in our hands this season to give us a lift for next season. Champions League I'm still shocked how we in Semi Finals 😀
You've got to feel bad for Timo, he's had a ropey season but the man opens up defenders and is always looking to pass across goal every time. He's had goals disallowed and gets hate every day.. if he starts scoring more he'll be dangerous next season
Champions of FA Cup and Champions League
Timo is so humble😌
Ziyech star
Zyech is very good
Wow... Kudos to Timo Werner's English tutors... This guy does more than scoring and that's the difference between him and Tammy Abraham
Thank you Tuchel.
Chelsea board made the right decision. We know we all love Super Frank, and everyone was unsure of TT.  But, it is what the club needed. Props to Super Frank for an excellent scouting and bringing in the likes of MM19, James, Ziyech, Mendy, Kai and Silva, and now TT to bring out the best in everyone.
انتضرو زياش لم يأتي بعد هذا فقط ربع أدائه
Habibi hakim ziyech !!!!!! 💕💕💕💕💕💕 My man of the match...
timo looked like he just woke up
Love this coach! Chelsea need to extend his contract ASAP
Master class from our manger congratulations to the whole team
Tactician Tuchel
Let's be honest, there is no player in Chelsea who has the skill and tact that Hakim Ziyech has
Chelsea fi life 💯🐊🐊🐊🐊
Have We Noticed That Even Though Timo Lack Scoring, But Always Assists!
Well one factor is that TT doesn't underestimate any opponent
How can I not love this team 🔵🔵
Guys Don't Forget that speech From Timo Werner! 4:00---4:04. Yah ah We can win Both of the Titles!
That interview made me love Thomas Tuchel, I had still been sceptical since Frank as I was annoyed, however whether I like the way the club treated Frank or not shouldn’t tar my opinion of Thomas Tuchel, realised that now! Silly it took me so long. Well done Thomas and the lads. I always believed no matter what.
I am so proud of this team! Love this Club!
*UP* *THE* *CHELS*
F.A is ours... UeFA is ours, EPL NO. 3 is ours  We are chelsea
coyb
WE MUST FOCUS NOW AT THE REAL GAME AND TOP 4 💙💙💙KTBFFH 💙💙💙COYB💙💙💙
Big Timo . Zyech smile .
if only the players would see the pass for Timo more ..he makes so many runs
ez win
Timo is a blue 💙
Never had any doubt, manager and players were superior today..CL.. come on!!
4:09 😳
LETS GO CHELSEA WE WILL WIN THE FA
As I said though Timo ain't scoring his work rate is super high. I also sink him and Ziyech can work. If Timo starts scoring defenders will have a problem.
I'm really starting to think Tuchel sabotaged his standing with the board at PSG to get let go so he could come to Chelsea. I'm glad he's here great manager.
Timo "yes of course" Werner
Werner speaks better Enligsh than Harry Kane
FA Cup 2021 winners😆😆😆
Timo "of course" werner
Werner with another assist 💪🏼💪🏼
Werner ajuda muito a equipe
Thannnk u our Wizard 🙌
Tim O‘Werner 💪🏻
CHE😆👏👊👍💙💪👀
Amazing win! well done Chelsea ❤️
Timo 'Yes Of Course' Werner <3
Timo Yes of course 😂😂
Well done Thomas, great win.
Timo has been involved in 21 goals this season, I'll take that in his first season.
Someone check on Rory Jennings!
Now Imagine we had Eden with this guy at the helm!
It’s gonna be 2012 again
"Brave" and "Courage" are Thomas' favorite adjectives. Best hire in the last decade for the Blues. He's incredibly competent, and you can tell he has the demeanor to balance egos with media.
Give tuchel free rains this summer to get a no 9 and maybe a midfielder and a defender and we will win the league next year or definitely the year after
If you realise that we are going to win the champions league 4:09
Come on we can do it 💙
The saddest thing is - that our own so called "SUPPORTERS" harm timo the most - what a shame, what a disgrace - this guy is soo nice, friendly and humble and ALWAYS gives EVERYTHING he has for chelsea - when he was subed he could hardly run, he was totally empty from sprinting from one box to the other constantly. All my respect to timo and i'd like to deeply appologize for all these plastics - real supporters will NEVER point a finger on our own, so don't listen to those losers.
Ooh guys well done in sha Allah we will win. Please we should  Hakim chance to show us who is he. Happy Ramadan to all muslims all over the world.
This game explain that werner is’nt floop
This season has 2012 vibes wrote all over it, we lost our manager half way through that season... we went on to win the FA and champions League, this team gives me the same vibes, we’re in the semi finals of champions league and FA Cup final, there’s no reason why we can’t go on and win both from the position we are in!
There is no way Real Madrid fans can say they are comfortable going into this game
Tuchel with those F.A cup ears.
Very well thought cerebral answers by Timo love hearing him settle into the English language
Please no one should disrespect timo anymore yea he misses alot of goals but he's been involved in much more too and that's a fact
I can’t praise Tuchel enough, he’s turned this club around in such a short space of time.
"Really? So it's nothing special" I love Tuchel 😂

Just a reminder to all of the real madrid fans that chelsea players are in form right now
Timo's English has improved massively lately....can't wait to see him prove doubters wrong
Amazing 🔥🔥

Jorghino masterclass
Habibiiiiiiii
Tuchel outclass pep is what we love to see
tuchel is taking the losing team into winning fa cup and champinons league
Could i believe my own two. 1234 carefree!!!!
You can really tell hes happy with this result and also with the team and chelsea overall
In Tuchel I love.. Common Chelsea 💙💙💙
So many people laughed at me when I said Tuchel would make the difference. Who’s laughing now
I am still finding the guy who told that he will have a tatoo of Thomas Tuchel on his back if Chelsea beats City!!
Is the history repeating itself finger crossed I can’t wait
Feels like 2012 all over again. A weak underdog team against the other teams, but we're coming out with the results
I think Werner and Ziyech are inspired by Drogba, always performs at the big games 💙✨👏
4th FA cup final in 4 years Thomas: REALLY? So nothing special😂
Good job TT.....
Up Chelsea
Love CHELSEA👍
4 fa finals in 5 years.... REALLY??😂😃😅😆😁😂 I LOVE HIS ATTITUDE
If we have beaten the best team in Europe well that makes us the best team in europe
Very Proud💙
Hakim Ziyech is a legendary player, Tuchel, a genius
Big up TT Top Manager , knows the game ..Chelsea  fans appreciate  You ,
Timo gave us a goal with his speed, appreciate him more
Im not going lie. I can’t wait to see the ALL OR NOTHING: CHELSEA documentary if it’s being filmed cause what Tuchel has done is crazy!!! He’s made a mockery of transitional managers.
I AM GOING TO MAKE CHELSEA A TEAM NO ONE WANTS TO PLAY AGAINST!     ~THOMAS MASTER TACTICIAN TUCHEL
Tuchel brought the same buzz to the club back that we used to have with Antonio conte. Long wait but worth it
Proud of this guy.
Come on chelsea 💙
very good defense,I'm happy thank you team🐃🐺🦊💙🌟
Up the chels 💙💙💙
1st German coach to reach FA cup final And his win on his first wembley game With a clean sheet
منلقاش شي مغربي هنا 🇲🇦؟
Timo has beautiful voice
This is Chelsea DNA strong defence and sharp on counter attack.
Today we made history! Today Liverpool & Manchester United fans came together to support Chelsea!😆😆

We need next session Harry Kane
The coach is the best player for the team Chelsea. TT is a great tactician we must be very lucky to have him at our disposal👌
It was Chelsea against all Premier league teams today  Again we go against all odds we are Chelsea weldone lads
Fantastic.
TUCHEL PLAY MORE ZIYECH

Alhamdullilah😭🥲our boys did it.our manager is the best ever.we onto the final
Hats off to Chelsea 😎
Ziyech 💚🇲🇦💪
i feel like City sold the game, they played with their bench players the whole game except De bruyne and Gundogan .. but a win is a win
Chelsea gonna win against Madrid
Tuchel HAS set CHELSEA on FIRE 🔥
Congratulations on the chelsea win thank you for winning the disgusting Manchester City.  Good luck for the rest of the season embrace the Porto 💙💪

As a Chelsea fan I rate FODEN extremely highly. Wish he was a Chelsea player
What a goal from hakim ziyech Best player is the world
MAN WE LOVE YOU THOMAS, WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH 💙💙
In Tuchel we trust
Come on the blues
UCL WINNERS 2021 who’s with me
11/12 season vibes.
I always felt bad, when others mocked timo when he lost the chance. He deserves more than that.
I was so happy to see Timo smile after so long. More to come 💙
Clean Sheet Kepa 🔥🔥🔥
FODEN WHO???????
Let's paint Madrid blue 🔵😎
TURBO TIMO
Chelsea be careful about this mans contract because Bayern need a new manager
Hakim Ziyech king of the match.
Thomas Tuchel-"I will build this team that no one will play against"
In love with TT right now
Ziyech ❤️🇲🇦
Let's Goooooooo!!!  Madrid we are coming for you 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
So happy with the result today hopefully we can maybe win the FA Cup and the Champions league too maybe 💙🔵
Thank you 😊
4:08 Shane Dawson is that you?
Turbo Timo now has 19 involvements in goals!  Most out of any other Chelsea player
The numbers in 2012 can be rearranged to make 2021..
we are so good and no reason why we aren't top 10 teams in Europe, what a squad we've got
Everyone was counting Chelsea has a underdog against city I'm a Juventus fan but this chelsea team is going to be dangerous especially if timo starts scoring again
Timo assists once again and Hakim finishes once more.   Shouldnt be a repeat of last final.  1st silverware of many with TT.  Ziyech with the goal Timo with the Assist Kante with the wall Rudiger with the rock Ben Chillwell excelling  #  The wizzard MOTM
Tuchel Master Tactician 👌👌
Man City got a belting.
LOVELYYYYYYYY COYB BLUE IS THE COLOUR FOOTBALL IS THE GAMEEEEEE
Up the CHELS,,,,
Chelseas defence is too strong. 💪
Chelsea form has completely turned around since Thomas tuchel came
Let's go Chelsea!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Up the Chels
COYB
