Liverpool f.c
😂❤🎉
Take videos of bradly more pls pls❤
what is that equipment Fabinho is doing in minute 7??
Молния 🎉❤
Hello Darwin my name IS fara Mendy I lake you
Why Musiałowski doesn't get a chance to train with the first team?
Wow, Kanye West, Jay-Z, Dire Straits, Fleetwood Mac... Quality music! 🎉
What are they doing with their ears there out on the pitch?
Darwin seems to be progressing with his English well, hopefully there won't be no more miscommunication this coming season upfront.
Liverpool please check this player MORTEN HJULMAND  for perfect Fabinho replacement
Can anyone help me to find out what is the song being played 2 minutes and 50 sec's....... Come on you REDSSSSSSSS
What are they putting in their ears ?
Done with pretending to know……..why are they being pricked in the ear every complete round
Bruh Darwin’s English is so much better
Keep working hard and never give up! I love how inspiring you are. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Looks like darwin has gotten a sunburn. Tell him to use sunscream
The chemistry in this club man 🔥🔥
❤❤❤
Phänomenal Phänomenal Phänomenal Phänomenal Phänomenal Phänomenal Phänomenal Phänomenal Phänomenal Phänomenal Phänomenal Phänomenal Phänomenal
Man I love Gomez but I think he needs a trim to spice things up. Get him feeling brand new for the season. As a guy I know what it does for you.
If liverpool loses henderson and fabinho please bring caicedo to anfield 🙌❤️
Jurgen is a very cool manager he's my favourite
the egyptian, is the first   ....!! (use your mind Dom! ) + 1 HMill pipo  🙂
😂😂😂😂 i just like the way Klopp hugs with serious slaps on the back 😅😂😂😂
rename the test to milner test 😂 7 years winner 😁
Does anyone know the music at 1:38 ?
Good taste of music at all
push push push push puuush
1:20 classic Darwin reaction !
Suerte para esta temporada💪
Play Trent in the midfield, shift Gomez to RB and give Nat Phillips more chances at CB.
Go hard boys 💪🏽💪🏽
Darwin has a nasty sun burn at 1:50?
Darjizzy looks thinner
Why Klopp talking to nunezin early ones, the video silent??
❤️❤️❤️
6:55 I thought Fabinho was about to give birth
Good to see the guys back, most of them look promising for next season, Stefan and Calvin are really putting in much, looks like there will be much effort coming from the bench, Adrian looks to enjoy the company of the teammates 💯
Let’s go liverpool … Too much expatation on this new season … We all need to explode and destroy everyone on our road to trophies 👍🏻😎
i can smell PL trophy this season..i put my entire month salary to bet Liverpool won the league and Europa League
nuñez♥
De vuelta en casa mis muchachos❤
What did klopp say to Nunez @1:45
So fake all the hugging
27 the GOAT
Who in Paris?😊😊😅
Need you guys to be on form this year  cos we cannot have City pocket another league title
Great music selection ;)
Belakang nunez pun ada panau.rilek je haha
1:19 FFS Nunez..."Que'
Nat Phillips deserves a chance 😢
Klopp will go down in history as the best coach for Liverpool 🎉
Am i the only one that noticed the kiss on Nunez body? And the burned skin on hes back?
Seeing Thiago showing up but not training is really worrying
What are they doing to their earss
People in the comments wishing ramsey plays this season are really just wishing that trent plays in midfield this season 😅
🔥🔥
nunez panuan tuh pundaknya
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Milner
Reds the best 👏👏✌✌
como lo banco a Darwin 😍
What is that thing they’re doing with their ears
Klopp says: COMO ANDAH? To Darwin Nuñez
Darwin speak Eng😭🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻🫡
Whoever had the aux cord was on point
I Love Van Dijk ❤❤ Big Player ❤❤❤❤❤
But Klopp must buy a RB.
Hope Millie comes back as backroom staff in the future.
Glory Glory MAN UNITEDDDD.  Glory Glory MAN UNITEDDDD. 🔴🔴👹
whats with the moody music choices, Liverpool? Is that a reflection of the lack of UCL this year?
Was that Gomez on the ground at the end?
❤❤ 💯 ⚽ ✊💪💪👏👏👏
❤❤ 💯 ⚽ ✊💪💪 👏👏👏
❤❤💯⚽✊💪💪👏👏👏
Why too much hug.just hand shake or wifi hello
greetings from bolivia.
it's a pleasure to see you back in Training.  Please, make every afford to make Mr. J. Klopp a winner in this tournament.   He is the best trainer to be in the finals and loses to be the silver winner.
So who won this year with Milner gone?
man, how I love this club, the way everyone treats each other like a real family is amazing
You all welcome
That stadium it's a shame.... It's like playing in a cage..........shame
Just not the same without bobby 😢
Was thiago doing training
ils sont payés cher là c'est pas pour la mairie hein gagagagagag
Whoever has Tracy Chapman playing >>>
This when you appreciate the dedication all the pro’s have. No way could I be bothered with all of that boring indoor prep and someone fiddling with my ears.
James Milner ❤ is a great miss here !! The machine !!
Ahhhhh man I’m buzzing for this season!
everyone hugs everyone ...thus why i support LFC
I can't wait to watch Liverpool play and I'm dying to see the carnage at Anfield.
Please buy new dmf our his change fabinho
That Nunez sunburn looked horrible
Friday night league trainning😂
Why Joe Gomez dont leave?
Klopp is looking fresh and ready
🥺Miss Bobby ❤
Trent with that trim ❤
Que equipaso esta armando el Liverpool, son favoritos desde ya para ganar la Europa League
Lots of back slapping lol 😂
0:49 free fresh fruit at the AXA? best training centre ever

Who picked the golden oldies tracklist for the gym then? haha
Take a shot every time someone does a clap handshake.

ผมดีใจและปลื้มใจที่ทีมที่ชอบตั้งแต่อยู่ป.5จนถึงวันนี้ผมอายุ51แล้วได้ชมการฝึกซ้อมของเด็กมีความสุขจัง😅😅😅
Joe gomez out
Belter tunes in the background 👌🏼
Europa oppa
They are looking sharp
I miss Milner 😢😢
salax
Nice to see Stefan out on the pitch. Missed him a lot, and hope for a great recovery and strong next season! Much love!
Here we go!
Hi boss
I hope nunez improve his english
Reeeeealy gonna need you Joe, I can feel it.
Where is Szobo
Nunez Nunez nunez rip F--- mancity apart 💪💪 I feel he will have a. Great season  Im not happy that Thurman is not being bought he will be a massive player 😔
Ésta temporada vas a romperla Darwin daleee
Nunez will shine
Nunez can speak English now😭😄
Son Heung-min also wants to transfer
And where is Szoboszlai?🤔🤔
So we aren't gonna talk about what  happened at Darwin's back
Gomes, matip, fabinho back in training is shocking they are at best squad players
Back on track ynwa ❤
Tell this Nunez to be more CLINICAL with his Finishing,  we can't withstand this one on one miss again this season.  He better still watch Hallan way of doing things as a striker
OMG to the two don mclean songs from 70s playing in the gym~!
I wish Klopp and his team a successful 2023/2024 season
Very excited for preseason. It is now imminent that the new group of players gel together. Diaz, Salah can produce moments that take Anfield's breath away, but for me, I prefer team goals and more predictable plays so that I will not have to depend on heart-attack goals 😂
Mo salah ???
Sb know the song title starting at 2:11 :D?
No Milly. No Bobby. 😢
It’s like they have my playlist.
우리 손 리버풀로 옵니까???제발 우리 손 리버풀로 오길 바랍니다 리버풀 포에버~~~!!!😆😆😆😆
What are they doing to their 👂?
Iam a barca fan  but I like  kloop  ❤❤❤
Getting ready for their 5th place finish 😂

That's really good go go go
Enaknya di Klub Profesional, semua diperhatikan dan dilayani dengan sangat baik. Rasa kekeluargaan yang kental itu sangat penting untuk menghadapi tantangan di musim depan. Go Go Go Liverpool
Here we go again YNWA 🎭🌹
Listen 8:17 the Liverpool staff mention “Fernandes Portugal” The only person they could be discussing is 24yo CM/CDM Gedson Fernandes from Besiktas 👀
1:20 Adrian do like doctor strange here xD
เราจะกลับมาอย่างยิ่งใหญ่ตลอดไปผมรักลิเวอร์พูล
Liverpool I hope you can do a match against Persib Bandung from Indonesia
ramsey still around ?
❤i love liverpool
Isso e inacreditavel o joe gomez treina o ano todo e nao aprende a jogar . esse zagueiro e uma mae ta louco. Liverpool precisa de um zagueiro urgente
🔴liverpool and klop can sing✅ ANEL AHMEDHODZIC 🔴Sheff UTD THIS SEASON PLAY 🔴PlEAGUE 🔴HIS NOT EXPENSIVE 🔴 ALSO HIS QUALITY 🔴Defender he 24 tall stronger🔴
Darwin for most goals in pl 23/24
What are they doing to their ears?  Taking blood?
Good guys
Ljinders strolling in dressed like he’s just been to one of his book signings. 😂
Damn Europa league aint ready
YNWA
No Milner to set the bar this year!
Why are they pricking their ear?
Hope Liverpool are fit and ready for next season and get in the champs league
Klopp is the dude, honestly. Part of crew. Could go anywhere and have a great time! UP THE MIGHTY REDMEN!
❤
Go !
My guys 💕💖
What are they doing with their ear thing
Pros so fresh.... what's their diet and sleep reigment???
Good to see the lads. Can’t help but feel a bit sorry for Nat Phillips, if he ends up being stuck at LFC and retires with about 20 appearances over multiple years, it doesn’t sit right! The lad wants a career, not a free season ticket in the Mani Stand.
Klopp's smile is so infectious as everyone smiles when they are around him. He is loved by so many people and fans, were blessed to have him at our club.
Nah don't be cutting out the audio like this man 😭
Inside the Europa League.
look at the kiss mark on darwins ribs lmao
Where’s milner
How much time off do the players get?

Yangi mavsumda omad tilayman ❤
Nunez look like zlatan ibrahimovic
Darwin has sunburn on the back of his neck lol
Gomez is rubbish but konate is different class
No sound in min 1:51
What are they doing to their ears?
There's something about Stefan that reminds me of Luka Modric. He could be big for us in years to come
Darwin 40 premier league goal soon
lol
What did Jurgen day to Nunez that they cut out ??
What are they testing in ears?
Liverpool🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮
Europa league hahahahaha
❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
0:42 .  Nunez, please start learning English
Where is Szoboszlai? Can't wait to see him scoring for Liverpool
Maclister di mna..
Thiago already injured ?
What’s the thing with the ears?
Go liverpool ❤
Klopp looks excited... Looks ready to get to work... I have good feelings about the season ahead... still a little short on signings but there's still time!
Europa league  hhhh
YNWA ❤❤❤
Nice to see Ramsay in the training. I thought that they wanted to loan him, but maybe he will provide a good cover for TAA after all.
Cant wait to see mac allister and szobszlai ♥️
If LFC gets Sonny, Heung-min Son, the master of winding kick from Hotspurs in this transferring season, the club would become the final winner of EPL, FA, and Champs. I'm assured that.  Welcome, Sonny!  👍👍
Darwin Nunez, I've seen League 2 players with a better 1st touch!!! £60million for a steaming pile of💩
Bring number 6
Is Tiago still with us?
only 5 player? Where is all team????????????????????
Millie had a drone keeping an eye on them running 😊
Its weird not seeing Bobby
Viv liverpool ❤
are you piercing their ears?
osssh.... already missed milly and bobby...
Iam happy to see calvin and Nunez
I wish everyone had a job like Adrian
Good to see you back lads.
Love this FC
Thiago leaving? Not part of training group
No Milner 😢. Who will have the best lactate test result this summer?
Where is Salah?
Europa here we come I'm confident that we gonna win it
Bajcetic actually looks like he gained some muscles
Nunez gonna explode soon
Cool!
Caring from Klopp smile ❤️

10:17 Darwin "Finish holidays....guys come on"
Love the playlist in the physio room
All this is well and good. But we need results this season and some trophies please.
whose setting the Running PACE/ STANDARD  now !!!.....since Milner is not there ? ....LOL!!!
Konate where still in mecca
❤é um sonho jogar em Liverpool
I l'm Liverpool fanclub
Why was Darwin;s conversation with Klopp muted? Did he speak English?
Tu ma manque beaucoup ❤❤❤❤
Fabinho always looks tired
All the best my Liverpool ❤
Few days now till we start seeing the boys in action. Darwin Nunez wants to take over from Milner as the King of the Lactate Test, yeah? Love to see it
mbape ?her go
I thought Calvin Ramsay was on loan?
King Milner is no more here.
⚽Le café ☕ est pour les Closers pas de café pour trump
Selamat pagi! Good morning! Guten Morgen! From Indonesia!
The 4 of them need to step up!
So who won?
Darwin's speaking English 🎉😂❤
Let’s go boys....❤
Gmoez, show me what you got!!
Liverpool Fc 4 life YNWA
What's that placed on their ears?
The lads are back  To win the league,,you’ll never walk alone ❤️🌍🙏🏿
Where r the rest
Incredible taste in music lads. Dire Straits, The Doobie Brothers and Tracy Chapman.
darwin looks a little skinnier no?
Klopp is such a vibe
Only clicked on the video to try and spot Alexis and he wasn’t there… 🤷‍♀️
Why Joe Gómez is still in Liverpool? He must be out!!
What is that that they are doing on their ear? 9:23
6:30 - 6:34 westside gunn cameo 💀
Guinea pigs
Darwin's English is really coming on happy for the lad he's  a hard worker
Good to see some of the boys back <3
Someone please explaine for me the role those little vests that players are wearing while exercising!!!!
Yes and we are back and it's great to see how committed the players are for coming back to training so early,  YNWA super REDS 🙏97🙏 ❤💚☘
Milner wins.
how many km do they usually run in the test that was done last in this video?
Why do they take it from their ears so weird
So.....Thiago came in but didn't take part.  Any reason why?  Injured or being sold?
Where are the others?
Usually we watching milner for  very first day😢
DJ dropping bangers
I MISS FIRMINO A WHOLE MOOD😪😪
I thought calvin Ramsey was on loan?
Who is in paris
What are they doing to their earlopes?
Let's go
I want primar league please😞❤️
The sports science is becoming out of this world. 💥💥 Love it
You really need a music manager and take into consideration the massive psychological effect of different music styles. Absolutely ridiculous hearing this music played in a training center.
this season should be our treble leage ,fa cup and the Europe leage
Lactate test will never be the same without Millie
Reds is BACK ❤❤
كلوب افضل مدرب في العالم شكرن لي يررغن كلوب وا الفريق
If this season, Liverpool is doing poorly, these 4 players and klopp will be gone
everyone loves everyone, i love that🥰
What is it the staff keep checking their ears each round they run  Sorry my husband was watching this and i just accidently continue and curious
jo Gomez needs some motivating! poor lad looks like he is somewhere else
I need szoboszlai and McAlister content
YNWA 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
Godluck guys
missing milner already.
Copyright strike incoming for the music
what are they doing with the ear thiing and get some jogging?
Interesting insight. As a young athlete you'd just love all that scientific back up to help your body. So odd, however, that we get so many injuries given all that knowledge.
Love the playlist in the background! Up the Reds!
Deutschland braucht Jürgen Norbert Klopp!!  Der Hansi "Flicken" muss weg!
What did they do with the ear
Adrian still in my team🥺🥺🥺
They are listening to Fleetwood mac in training 😍
Gomez suck last season
what do boys do with their ears before and between fouts?
Another Europa season can't wait for the excitement.  Please we want fresh excuses this time for failing to deliver 😂😂
🎉 Let's hope good thing
Why was the audio gone with Nunez talk to Klopp
💚🤍💚🤍
Where is James Milner 🥲
Fast Car by Tracy Chapman...someone's got great taste!
Fab looking worried...& with good reason! He needs the season of his life or he'll be gone before next season starts. I have faith in Fab though...he can do it.
I wish they'd hire someone to do video transcripts. To better connect to each player via hearing all conversations better, you know.   Save for 1:50 to 2:00 that got muted, guess Klopp mentioned something quite private from Nunez
I am not very into the news, but where the hell is Dominik? Appeared once or twice for some interviews and that's it. Has he even met his teammates?
SALAM, QAYS. 2023-2024, APL, NE PROİQRAYTE. 1MESTO BERİTE, GOLD MEDAL. YOUR MY HARD❤.    I LOVE, L i V E R P O O L. DO YOU ANDESDAD ME, BY
I can't wait to see the lads lift up the Premier league,  champions league Trophies  this season.
Welcome back lads 😘
Is there Nunez talking in English??
the sound.....plz!!!!
Klopp is best coach
Thiago injured???  I saw ricky Lambert in Brisbane 2016 pre season and he soon left,thiago gives off the same vibes
Tunes are boss ahahah
i miss milner for such content... hahaha.. what a legend... darwin looks in better shape.
9:37 a wild jay spearing appears
Please buy Kudus🙇🏿
What do they do to their ears before the test?
rise stefan
4:48 when did we sign Gvardiol?
gomez✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
Anyone else finding the PR hugs annoying at this point? I especially don’t like Pep Linders. He’s useless. If we don’t set up to defend properly we are we going to win sweet f.a.
Klopp looking good
I wonder what Klopp said to Nunez that y'all had to cut the audio😂😂😂
This team is hilarious. Why are they blasting fast car at the gym 😂😂
❤ 🇹🇭 🧤 😎
was it muted when klopp spoke to nunez? lol
Fabinho still looked washed… let’s hope he steps up this season
What's with the muted bit? If you can't publish the audio just clip that bit out
t Hi   i think what Next for Liverpool is Kloop tweaking his formation 4-3-3 to make Liverpool difficult to breakdown once again in many ways .Formation 3-5-2 with pressing and counter attacking with quick transition from defense to to attack.Any way most of our currents  players are not good enough in 4-3-3 System if you watchedall ManC games last season Gaurdiola tried nearly all formations4-3-3/3-5-2 /4-2-3-1/3-2-4-1/4-4-2and all worked for him.
Thiago looks like he's just passing through
🔥
I wish i will play in this team one day🎉🎉
I want a Klopp hug
i always love shots of axa cafeteria it looks so homey, if that make sense
We should of kept milner and played him at Rb
I miss Milner who always was champion of  lactate test.
Good to see everyone back. Come on Liverpool let's show them who we are .can't wait for the season to start YNWA
Drone footage! Nice upgrade LFC TV team, looking forward to it this season!
C’mon boys. You all are the champion. From indonesia 🇮🇩
cannot wait for the new season to begin , come on you red men
What are they doing in ears of player? Can anyone clarify
First pre season training without James Milner, damn.
that playlist was very confusing
Stop looking for midfielders . Quickly find the best CB for this team
Wow Remsay 👏👏
Im so happy to be a Liverpool fan right now
James milner would of won the fitness test 😊
Bajcetic becomes a monster this year
10:20 finished holiday
Fabinho doing strength test to The Chain by Fleetwood Mac is the best comeback montage ever!!!  Let's go Fabinho we know you'd never break the chain 🔗🔥🔥🔥
You.ll never wall alone keep up ♥️🔥
Im curious who is gonna win the lactate test this year
The world is not ready for Darwin this season 😎
Klopp seems to have lost some weight, looks leaner than ever.
Fabinho and Darwin redemption season?
Good to see you again guys❤
🇹🇭❤️
I believe there was 27 more hugs this year, I'm excited for the new season.
LIVERPOOL IS FAMILY❤️
Does anyone feel like Fab looks physically drained??
Man would've dropped like a fly😅
My boys are back🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
I'am waiting for Mac allister and dominik szboszlai 🔥
Ilove liverpools inside trianing and whow the teammates jokes each other from chelsea💙
Darwin with good English
Thiago coming in to clean his locker out 🤔
0:31 two USELESS players.
If it wasn't for the middle east we'd have another few leagues
What does Calvin Ramsay ding at AXA, isn't he loaned ?
Joe Gomez can you do it at right back.  Milner you are a true legend !
whoever chooses the playlist at AXA is top tier
We need to get Jan Molby in to give a Master Class on pin point accurate passing. If we got that sorted we'd been flying as well as if we can eliminate the injuries!
Good to see some of the lads back especially the young ones back to fitness such as Bajetic, Gordon and Ramsay. ❤
Its weird without Millie
Let's go! 🎉🎉🎉
9:55 what do they do with the ears? 🤔
Who won this year, with no Milner?
Where’s the next signing , we never go over 100 - £120 million only if we sell a huge star like we did after Coutinho sale.
So no other club likes Joe Gomez
Guys did you see his skin at his back 1:52 I’m concerned
LET'GO GUYS 🔥 🔥 🔥
starting with the perfect dap???? uk this video is going to be good
Fab looks fitter hopefully back to his best
I love how Curtis Jones stood up at the table to greet the bosses.   Class act.
Awesome playlist in the background 👍
I Miss the new season the way i miss my wife.
What a brilliant club we support.  Huge that Bajcetic is fit. Takes the pressure off them having to sign another mid and allows them to look at the defence.  Hope we see the best of Fab again.
Klopp is the best thing to happen to premier league since it started
Attack is awesome. Midfield still a question mark if the can break up play and protect the defence. The new lad Szoboszlai will have his hands full. No alternative for Fabinho unless they push Thiago down. Defence is time to gel after last season's bundle of nerves. Konate needs to step up and help cover from Van Dijk, who is starting to slow.
Please beat Manchester until home and away this next season their fans are trashing talking in my area
davin ดูตั้งใจมากเป็นพิเศษ ขอให้เป็นปีที่ดี มั่นคง แข็งแรง
2:19 i thougt that was arjen robben 😅
Darwin will be brilliant this season, I just have a feeling
Looks like everyone was loving being back.  Looking forward to this season.  Come on you red men. Ynwa
I don’t know if this has been said before but don’t you think this is allowing the opposition to see the insides of our training, club and way we do things? Don’t want to give anyone an advantage!
Where are other players?
Someone can explain to me what they take out of their ears and check when they run.Almost this exercise is repeated in Liverpool only every season
LFC ❤
What is song at 3:44 ?
Glad to see the lads back home. Welcome y'all
Where is the audio from Darwin meeting Klopp???
I think those who reporting back the first clay are the one who got injured toward the encl of the season. Hope everyone are healthy, get reacly for pre season training n stay fit
Nunez looking like a monster awaiting for the season start
Doesnt ramsey loaned at preston?
Good to see tje boys back
7:28
What was they doing to their ears?
How many laps do they normally do?
Make sure soft ollies Lijnders doesn’t write no more books.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Welcome back guys
Who will be the new bleep test king, now that Milner has gone?
No millie to show them how it's done this pre season, who's gonna step up!
I am missing Miller already 😢
Not convinced by Nunez. Hugely talented but his attitude seems kinda egoistic and low IQ. Hope he matures and learns to control his emotions and handle pressure
so Darwin is now our stamina monster? previously was our vice captain James Milner!
Where is mac allister and szoboszlai
Pls...give stefan play time. I love that guy. We never walk alone... much love mates
Hola😅😅
Great taste in music whoever the Dj is
Szoboszlai?
There Will be A great season
You all just watched a bunch of guys handshaking.
Evolution for Darwin in new season。🎉🎉
Gue yakin Liverpool bakal gacor dimusim depan 🔥
What are they doing to their ears
❤
ynwa <3
We begin with much energy YNWA
Klopp lost lot weight, he looks ready to fist pump LFC back in more success again. 👍🏼
Cant wait for the match 🔥🔥
Hopefully they are working on fabinho agility,and power
One creator is Almighty
OH
happy to hear Darwin's English looking good
Liverpool welcome back ❤❤❤❤❤
We need a proper G, we need a out n out goalscorer like the main warrior, Darwin isn’t a G he isn’t fitting the position he to lightweight we need a main man up front who shows no mercy
This is gonna be a historical season for LFC. Relegation imo.
can't wait to see Szoboszlai to meet his teammates
where is Diaz
YNWA ♥
The boys look so fresh..
Im really hoping our pep will become a successor of klopp one day, he fully deserved it
Happy to be back Manager 🎉🎉
The boys are back in town lets show the rest of the premier league we mean business this season
Let's go the reds ....another amazing season to come.
Good to see the lads back, YNWA
Hey Klopp, How is ya hamstring?
Big season ahead! YNWA
Love the determination and zeal from Darwin to succeed and progress next season. Keep it up Lad 👍
it was strange not seeing milner and firminho in training
Don't know about anyone else but i was waiting for milner's arrival,only to remember he left 😢
is this the whole team
Release Gomez to a championship club for free. That's where he belongs.
I'm just here to see who the new champ is
Nice
Ramsay will be a hit soon after loan now
This is a great family indeed
Dominik alister ?
Happy to see you back guys. Nunez wish him a productive season and rhe team generally
bajcetic :'))
Matip is such a character. Really hope he kind find his form again this season as this is the kind of lad that makes a team gel.
As much as we fans hates Gomez, the training ground and staffs loves him!
Thiago... Thiago alcantara❤😊
❤❤❤ Liverpool❤❤❤❤❤
Ahh the right back kid is still there, good to know. Now when will he play?
Great to see the boys are back 💪🏽😀 seeing Klopp is a breath of Fresh Air 🤗 you have been so missed 🫶🏼, good luck for the new season everybody👍🏽 exciting times ahead, 💯 can’t wait 😃, YNWA ❤❤❤
Boss looks happy, players look happy and fit. Bring on the next season we will be winning a lot!
Darwin seems to be gel in . Show us your worth this season Nunez!
Congratulations to Curtis and Harvey on winning the European Junior Championships.  Well done guys👍
5:10 such a hardworking need more game time!
What are the fancy stretching machines they’re using? Sports science is so advanced these days
Calvin ramsay gonna get more games
Please don't include Gakpo in the main squad because he really doesn't fit in this team
A shout out to Milner, coming in on Day 1 and being the fittest person on the squad 😢
With the players we have this season, we should win the EPL. This trophy alone is enough for the season. 🎉
Never fail to win 🎉🎉
Darwinnnnn
Such an awesome family ❤ If Milly was still here he would be running the whole training program!
Wanna be there just for the Playlist.. Doobies Fleetwood Knoppler..Heavens!!
Welcome back boys
Liverpool should sign free agent Hazard to play midfielder.
please open download option
Liverpool come back is not easy seasonal 2023_2024 darwin is goat ❤
4:53 - Didn't know gvardiol signed!
Europa incoming 😢😂
I love this club 🫶🏻❤️
darwin panuan anying
Back this season hungrier than ever
I think Thiago is injured
I hope we also win a treble this season😊
Curious question, what’s the multiple blood sample before & after a lap run for? Interested in the sport science thing about it.
Hope to see you soon
3:53 Woow woow😂😂😂😂Nunez improving
Well we know Milly wont be winning as usual this year. YNWA
How joe Gomez is still here is beyond me...
What happened to the rest of the squad
I love liverpoool
If Darwin let’s his man bun down he will score 50+ goals
EPL Champions
Hello Liverpool, I'm Brazilian and I support Liverpool and I wanted to say that I love Liverpool so much ❤️❤️
ywhy do they check their ears help me to know
Fabinho arrives late  Looks tired after doing the cardio test  Testing strength on quads and calf's he done in  Bodes well for the season doesn't it
1st training without Millie
YNWA we are ready for next season to crush every club in EPL
We are bouncing back
Great
Where is szoboslai?

I love this club very much.
Viva livarbool
where dat boy virgil van dijk at
Darwin ❤
Ben Doak - Curtis Jones - Harvey Elliot - Fabio Carvalho will be the future of Liverpool
So many great tunes playing in the AXA👌
8:09
1.The hugs are not only a Klopp thing, but part of the culture.  I love it❤  2. I see the positive influence Adrian has on team. You can just see how people's face light up when he's talking to them. He really is an important figure in this team.  3. I really hope we'll see more of Calvin Ramsey( and Nat Phillips)this season. Crossing my fingers he doesn't get injured.  4. I know it's still early but it's soo weird not to see Milner on that field 😢.
2:45 nunez😳
Liverpool❤❤❤💪🏆
Mille will be missed
Ramsay became a man
i really wonder what are they doing with the player's ears.
That lactate test looks grueling
Thiis is Liverpool Family ❤
4:50 ain't no way we signed gvardiol already
Everyone loves a lactate test😂
Kanye west vibezz!!
Can't wait to see mac allister and Dominik
Easier said than done but we have to win the league this season!
Saya yakin tahun ini Liverpool bisa bersaing
I miss these guys
Good to see RAMSEY back. I hope he plays this season for us!
Nunez is not so bad with English come on guys😁
Can't wait for the new season  We want that PL title
miss the lactate test 😅
You Will Never Walk Alone ❤
What is Calvin Ramsay still doing at the Axa? Isn't he supposed to be with Preston? Hasn't Preston's preseason already started?
❤❤❤🎉
Spain can win if they have Bajcetic yesterday
Running sessions without James Milner, is awkward haha.. (he is the best)
Does anyone know the song Darwin was listening to at 1:36??
At this point I am genuinely convinced that Klopp is the real life Ted lasso
Whoever chooses the music deserves a raise 👏
Good morning klopp
come on redss❤
every day I am convinced more and more that klopp signed darwin bc he has a crush on him. I agree tho tbh bro is fit
Here we go !!!!!! 😮😊❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
ผมอยากไป  แอนฟิวล์
Go go go 🔥
🎉
❤❤❤❤ Come on reds!! Saludos desde Perú YNWA
มาติป เดินเล่นเลยนะ
Buy players.
This is time when i miss James milner.😅😊😢❤
Damn I miss milner already
Let's go lads
What they checking on their eyes
Joy East Bengal ❤️💛❤️💛
What are they checking on the ear on those 4 players, At the end of the clip ?
What is the coaches do with player ear?
Curtis Jones better be back within a fortnight because he had a brilliant end to last season and his target should be to keep his place in the squad and maintain the excellent form that he carried from us into the U21 Euros
Downfall of Liverpool 😂
Damn Darwin English is not bad
klopp seems energetic again
Good to see that Nunez's english has been better
Bajtetic is such a model bro
Come On Lads!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Darwin 30 goals this season ❤
Joe gomez violates the brand. He's wearing Adidas hhahhaha 3:32
Big team and great season loading!  Come on boyz ynwa 💂‍♂️

❤❤❤❤❤GO GO GO...💯 the RED❤❤❤❤❤
I’m waiting for it❤❤❤❤
Chamions leauge😪
Klopp is hittin gym
Thats why latino have a lot best player....they love their job and their attitude....
❤❤❤
Liverpool facility playing bangers only jeez
Joe gomez is such a good dude. But he is horrible at cb..maybe he plays rb this season when trent moves to midfield
No CL,No EL,,,
why is there only about 5 lads at training
Miss seeing Milly ace the lactate tests.
I kept confusing Darwin for Kostas
what are on ther ear?
Milner should join Klopp’s backroom staff
Let's gooo
Strange not seeing Milner to be honest
🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
Beatles songs playing in the gym, awesome tribute to heritage
Hopefully Calvin Ramsey will keep fit .. great potential in this young man🙏 and Darwin looks like he never left for summer break 🤣🤣🤣
they should rename the lactate test to ‘The Milner Test’
I hope Ramsay gets some play at RB.
😂😂😂😂oohhh
Whoever's DJing is busting out bangers man. Gives me hope for the team's mentality. 🤘😎🤘
No more Bobby 😢
Go LIVERPOOL... insyaallah 2024 TREBLE WINNER🎉🎉
The Reds Liverpool
4:36 what is the name of this song?
Welcome Back Boss and the lads YNWA
It must be strange without Milly setting the pace in training runs?
Credit to the guy playing the tunes in the gym has excellent music taste
Amazing I love liverpool❤❤
How many chance nunez will missing these season 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Fabi looking knackered already 😢
Darwin fitting more and blending with the squad you just love to see it.😍
tập luyện chăm chỉ cố gắng chuẩn bị cho mùa giải mới thật tốt nào các chàng trai
🤟🤟🤟🤟🧡🧡🧡🧡
Missing Millie
ای جانم لیورپول 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
So who won the lactate test?
Pep looks more relaxed than I've seen him and Fabinho looks like he belongs on a fashion cover .. love the brown and white tones ;-)
where is Szoboszlai?
The boys are back let’s go! WE ARE LIVERPOOL 🔴
ดาวินเริ่มใช้ภาษาอังกฤษบ่อยขึ้นแล้วเว้ยยยยยยยยยยยยยยย
VERY IMPORTANT SEASON LADS
We talking about another signing ... we just gonna forget about Bajcetic? And Jones?
We neeeeeeeed  Fabinho to hit his top form 🤌🏾🤌🏾🤌🏾
what day will the next group of players join the pre season training ?
Massive the fact Darwin is having a real pre season. Huge going forward for Gomez and Fabinho. Hope they can all step up to the next level.
Looks like opening day
Little concerned that thiago was not apart of training or didn't even have a bag with him
A training session looked quite fun to prepare for the new season. I hope our Liverpool players will practice well so that in the new season, they will play successfully and well
Is it fair to say Darwin won the lactate test?
Champion of Europe this year..
Thiago at the training ground but never trained.... think he's a gonner.
Supposed to sell gomez
Gomez behaving professionally and Matip pretending like he can play three games without injury
UERO PA
❤❤❤
Every training session like this we must miss the glimpse of Millie and Bobby. Anyway all the best to you all 💪🔥
really hope Darwin did learn some English. A propper Communication is vital in Klopps football
I am not a Liverpool fan but admire the club greatly.... I hope Gomez remains fit this season. He could solve a few problems and still only 26
As a 66 year old bloke I am stunned by how trim these guys look after their hols. Imagine the players of 70s and 80s coming back over weight and probably hung over please
quite an amazing playlist there.
Good view.
Darwin needs to learn English fast
what are they doing with the ear?
That's good guys,🌴✌️🌴
สู้ๆ
Only bangers on that playlist 😂😂
I hate to be that guy but this looks like a decent gym in a Highschool in the US. Lol I'd expect a club like Liverpool to have better stuff than this.
โคตรคิดถึงมากๆ❤❤❤
รักๆ
Good lucky liverpool team.
welcome back everyone we miss you
finally no milner
Welcome to preseason guys
C u in singapore
Where is Szoboszlai
Anjir Nunez ganteng2 panuan punggungnya 😂
Great to hear some decent tunes on the go for a change. Fair play to all involved!
1st or 2nd In EPL Runner up or Winners of UEL Winners of FA CUP Winners of LEAGUE CUP.  FOR REVENGE AGAINST ALL.  C'MON Liverpool.❤
What are they actually doing at 9:28
Darwin speaking English is what I want
bro Darwin's sunburn god damn
The first
Good teamwork.
I was so happy until I saw Gomez! Just sell him!
Where did Thiago go?
สวัสดีครับ.บอส.
I wonder how they’ve gotten away with the copyright for all of these songs in the video
ตั้งใจซ้อมกันนะหำ😀
I would do a lot of things to get a hug from Juergen.
Darwin is learning English quickly
Gangster Nunez is came back.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
4:55  I thought we signed Gvardiol😂😂😂
Is that Ramsey i see
Adrian out please
I miss pre season Jimmy Milner
Is that Ramsey i see
Please someone help me what's the song at 2.13
Some of the testing looks excessively intrusive, players don't look very happy about it. You'd think there'd be better ways of gathering the necessary data nowadays.
🥰🥰👏👏👉🇹🇭  FC. ครับ
it sucks so much not seeing milly in pre season testing :(
❤❤❤
Thiago in hospital again 🚑
❤❤❤❤
Fabinho sad there is no Bobby 😢😢
The new chicken season is about to open, wish everyone good luck
Why doesn't it have subtitles? 😂
Idk who makes the playlists where Fabinho had to do all that stuff, but he/she has a great taste
Come on liverpool I hope liverpool win the league champions league carabo cub fa cup I hope liverpool win all four trophys come on liverpool I'm a liverpool fan and I hope is liverpools year liverpool singed two new good players thank god let's go the reds I believe in you liverpool let's go
Es mi IDOLO Darwin Nuñez 🎉❤❤
Love which ever player/ person that was playing Don McLean that’s so obscure I love it
Who’s in charge of the music? Kanye, Rudimental, Harry Styles AND Kansas?? 😅😅😅
Standards are dropping without milner
No Millie on the lactate test is NOT the one.
And soboly
Where mac allister
love u all fr thai fan ❤  YNWA
best tunes in the background, cant beat the 80s
Millie is missing 😢
Miss milly alredy😢
I would like to look as fit & healthy as Koop when I’m his age 💪🏽
Ok,.but where is Szoboszlai?😊
Milly❤😢
Welcome back boys
That was milner thing,
Jurgen klopp is a positive vibes.
Darwin speaking English makes me happy
Cutting block 😊 all four
I wonder who’s going to beat Milner’s record on the lactate test.
Can't wait to see the team play.
Stefan is such a hard worker, I love it.
Jurgen is the best father
I will always miss Mili being the last man standing on these drills, what a pro he is.
For equality we should let more women in the mens team.
The science behind professional football is mind boggling
Now milner will rule the bitches in brighton. Will show them who's the boss. He is a physical endurance beast.
Great to see the lads....all the best music from my time,great to hear they listen to the real (musicians) music as well as the stuff we oftern hear..  ynwa
Boys are pumped up come on
Waiting to see you more dear Liverpool FC
Liverpool ❤❤❤❤❤❤
They love a hand clasp and man hug 😂
Szoboszlai ?
No milner for a lactate test, my God
1: 1:20 15
YNWA 🇮🇩
Lots of high fives and hugs. It means the team will do well this year. 😂
nunez back a bit burnt
Let’s go lads. This is our breakthrough season ⏳🙏🏾
We need one more signing to that team
Mac alister an szobozlai will do something great for Liverpool to be honest as a Chelsea fan
1:07 🤣🤣
Why is Ramsay there? Isn’t he on loan at Preston this season
Still the same midfielders. As a diehard Liverpool fan, I must say next season could be worse than the last one. Defense and midfield are below average, let alone world class. They better spend some cash now or forget about the top four again.
Missing millie😢
MY JOY GIVERS ARE BACK!!❤
Everyone loves lactate test 😂😂😂😂😂
Nice to see Calvin getting involved
Cant wait
Excellent team, excellent music!
is it me or did darwin get kuter? idk something has changed
We are the champions 🏆  2024 premier league winners
What were they measuring with the ears?
Adrian is on a right fkin song and dance isn’t he 😂
WE need more vidéo of training
Can somebody explain to me what are they doing on their ear lobes ?
Darwizyyyyyyy🔥🔥🔥🔥
no Milner there crushing everybody during preseason 😢
I really hope Nunez finds his shooting boots and confidence as the new season approaches. Our attack will be insane if that happens.
No way they dont show us who won 😂darwin was looking strong
We need to Sign gvardol and Lavia otherwise no change in our last year defensive problems, why don't we sell Joe Gomez , N.phillips and  J.Henderson
Hi
matip will get new 7years contract.
Who was djing?
thiago looks like a lego man the way he walks
Just vibing the Run this town music by jay z playing in the background
Were no good with interruptions  injuries to key players with a fully fit squad the new,players must gel quickly to get back form at the back
what was the thing they were doing with ears ?
Can't fckin wait for this season! YNWA
Why is there so few players?
I would have been on the floor half way round lap 1 thinking about a chip butty.
Arab owner better than USA owner  Look at Man City he don’t ask Pep question about the money or club or team
Darwin’s English is better
👁️🙏
SCOUT 🔥  SPORTING LISBOA (PORTUGAL) - JESUS ALCANTAR 🔥🔥🔥👌👌👌👍👍👍💪💪💪
Great to see everyone back. And loving Nunez's English.  But damn, whoever's on playlist duty, give them a raise.
Some great taste in music lads 🎉
Welcome back boys
I want Darwin to cut off that man bun, then I promise he’ll turn into Suarez.
These boys have it easy. Not getting beaten by Millie anymore 😅
Can someone please tell my why we didn't see Thiago in the training kit during this video.
My goat 🐐
Klopps new gangsta-style😂😂😂
Only one missing is our James ! 😢
Please send szoboszlai to training
Beep test not the same without Milner ❤
Why is Calvin not on loan at Preston?😂
Getting ready for the title
Looks like Darwin lost a bit of size on him.
can someone explain what was that ear thing they were doing?
What are they doing with the ears?
Even if I’m going thro a bad day that klopp smile just brightens my day. I know it won’t be possible but hope he’d be our manager for the next 10 years
Ok we're back Liverpool, lets go for another  season💥💥💥
I wish there was an all or nothing Liverpool it would be so interesting to see what happens behind the scenes
Good job to whoever’s responsible for the music playlist! Fleetwood Mac, Don McLean and CCR just to name a few.
The tunes at the training ground are on point!
So many things to be excited about and it’s just day 1 - this seasons gonna be a good one
Great to see your boys again 👏
this is a big season for fabinho i need him at the front of that pack!
happy to see the boys 😉😉
finally after such a wait I can see my favourite team again
Looks like Nuñez has been learning English quite well 😊
Welcome Back Guys. Wish You An Awesome Season Ahead. Love From Darjeeling. Y.N.W.A.
Lactate test without Milly 😢
I LOVE THIS TEAM
Liverpool have a good taste of music
thought gvardiol signed when i saw one pf the physios greet fabi
I want 2019 Gomez back 😅😅😅😅
จากไทยแลนด์ครับ❤️🤟
Kloop is  the most cool guy i ever seen.
Nice to see u guys
Need Onlyfans account for Nunes
Thanks for the kiss Klopp its much appreciated 🤣🤣
NO MILLY NO MACHINE MOTIVATION 😢😢\
نونيز عليه بوسة تحت ايدو اليمين 😂😂
Mapema ndo best 💯
das ist LIverpool fussball klub
Did anyone else see James Milner 10:39
Anyone else notice that when Jurgen is hugging  at 1:46 and he give them 3 big pats on the back
Half the team isn't their and looks like their is 8 or 9 players training. Either some are on an extended vacation or they are taking some private training lessons. Also when Darwin reunites with Klopp, does he have sun burn or is it just me???
When they did the lactate test what were they doing to their ears?
Love seeing klopp happy 🎉🎉🎉
I can see this being a massive season for Stefan B
❤❤
The doctor who worked on klopps eye really did a good job
Thiago coming back in to clear his locker ...
Is it just me or these players are going to be the best performing player at L.F.C❤
Welcome to pack 🎉🤝🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👑
What they put in the ears? Serius question
I can’t wait to see Dominik Szoboszly and Alexis Mac Alister
The only team Manchester City & Manchester City fans view as a real competitor & rival,Klopp's team at their best are a real problem,see you guys soon wish you best of luck apart from the day you'll be up against us.
A nice awkward exchange between Klopp and Darwin 😅 looks like his English is slowly improving tho
Nice one boys
2:44 is that a love bite on Nunez chest? 😆
what are they doing to the ears?
Good job wow wow wow 😊😊😊🎉🎉
Glad to see the boys are back. Masterclass season on the way 🚀
Let’s go for the league and the league guys
Doobie Brothers - Long Train Running? Dire Straights - Walk of Life? Don Mclean - American Pie + Vincent? Fleetwood Mac - The Chain?  Does someone there actually have good taste in music? 🤣
Got a good feeling about this season. Good vibes at the training ground day 1 without the full squad and the boys putting in the work. Darwins breakthrough season mark my words. COYR!
Adrian with his tunes on there. Dire Straits blaring!! Is right fella!!
6:45 sounded like Fabinho was in a child birthing situation..".Push, Push, Push...good Fabi"🤣
Who won the lactate test?
wasnt Ramsey loaned out?
Fab and bajetic as the dm is fine for the upcoming season. Bajetic coupd play an even bigger role this season so hoping he and fab play well.
Bring on Calvin Ramsey
Adrian is there for the vibes😂😂
Would love darwin to be on fire this season
Isn't Ramsay on loan already at Preston,how is he here?
What did they do with the players'ears?
we need a great pre season 👍+ we have a normal season ahead,great to see Curtis n Harvey WIN with 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 today YNWA PS no BOBBY 🥲
Ain’t even a Liverpool fan but how can you not love Klopp ?
Liverpool 🔥🇬🇭😍🇬🇭🇬🇭
Name me another manager who wears a baseball cap backwards?  Legend
What are they doing to their ears
The reds go to singapore Festival 💪
I need more of these videos immediately 😩
whose the tight fit blonde at the end, blammo
Always happy to see that Klopp smile!
Does anyone know which date the rest off the boys return?
Still have not replaced Bobby and the right back should be given to Tsimikas who has speed and can use both feet. How Klopp cannot see this?
Weldon guys 👋
Love these pre season training vlogs, hopefully more to come with other players due back tomorrow?! 😂👍
Only 4 boys🎉
The sports science is next level and the quality of videos produced by the Liverpool football club media team is top quality compared to other clubs, I would say Man City media team is also good but after LFC
Where is Szoboszlai?
We go again
Everyone missing Milly the lactate GOAT
nice to see calvin again. really hope he'll do well on preston 🙌🙌
Let's get it on boys are back ✨❤️
Too many scrubs😂😂
Great to be back to the fans aswell let’s give our team the support they need and much more this season YNWA❤️
Nunez 😂😂😂
Thiago!!!!
No Milner for lactic acid test ....
The James Milner Test
Adrian has the best job in the world...
Best
Where are the new signings
And a huge 'congrats' to Curtis Jones and Harvey Elliot on becoming U21 European Champions with England!
Here we go 🔥
Who's playing the Don McClean? Love it
Fleetwood Mac and Tracy Chapman on the jukebox.
Hope we can win the Europa League this season and qualify for UCL football. YNWA🎉🎉🎉
You will never walk alone 😊
What’s idea of testing lactate?
Wow Calvin still here
Playing the best music on the sound system. Only Liverpool
Have a Successful season ! I wish and believe it will be a Good Year !!! Juergen Klopp wishing you health and success ❤
Pls post more makes everything worth it
Why do the lactate test several time during the training? Hoping the team do better this season. I believe reinforcement is required in defence. VVD & Matip not getting younger and Gomez is injury prone.
where's james? 😮
no Milly :(
Come on the lads
I caught Fleetwood Mac - The Chain. Fast Cars - Tracy Chapman - Dire Straits - The Walk Of Life. Jackson Browne - Running on empty. Did I miss any? Someone at Liverpool FC has great taste in music :)
Welcome back guys 💪as Darwin said "Holiday over" 😅💪
The owners must be doing some sharky accounting / kick backs / mangement fee's etc. Arsenal just spent big bucks no problem, Liverpool 95m & all types of questions.
Why do they take blood from the earlobs?
Milner still wins the lactate test 🫶🏼😂
Don't know why Gomez is still playing for us. He's full of sh*t
Good see the lads back. Can't wait for the new season to begin
It's a happy camp at liverpool have a feeling it'll be a great season 🏆
Milner will not be beating everyone for the 7th time 😭😔
When do the new signings arrive, anyone?
Such a shame not to see the geriatric Milner putting all the youngsters to shame. :(
Joe Gomez still there oh no come on reds please 😮
1:05 was awkward🤣
09:15 Ez mire jó? Mit mérnek itt?
🔴❤️
Why is Calvin Ramsey still there? I thought he went on loan to preston
Going to be weird without Milly? Maybe he'll send us some videos of how to do it! ;D
Loving the dad rock playlist playing in the gym.
Happy days are back
Thiago is back but why not training?
Good  Liverpool F.C 💪⚽️💫🏃‍♀️👌👍
Liverpool for life 🤜🤛
I Love LFC
Liverpool FC for ever ❤️❤️❤️🏆❤️🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳
Where's the rest of the team? Please don't tell me they're injured already 😱 Jokes aside, I love watching this introspective content.
Let's go Liverpool let's go klopp YNWA
Big season coming up and we will be back fighting for trophies
Lets go Darwin!!!!
Where is szoboszlai?
DARWINS ENGLISH IS SENDING ME
Darwin is flashing the English lingo at Klopp, letting the gaffer know he's trying.
How's Calvin Ramsay here when he was loaned to Preston North End?🙂
Liverpool lactate test always entertaining
what are they doing to their ears?
Ramsey could literally play Arnold’s old role
Boys, we missed you.. welcome back. Let’s do this 🙌🏾♥️
Im think this is our  years to win epl title Liverpool Will become unstoppable force again
Thiago have to stay fit these season..
What were they doing to their ears ?
Wish you boys all the best from Bangladesh !  Let's get into some rhythm in the preseason. And congratulations to Elliot and Curtis for winning Euro U21 trophy! ❤
☺️ Klopp is so happy when he first walks in. Everyone needs a Klopp in their life
Now milner is gunna win the lactate at brighton wonder who is gunna win ours haha
milner gone doesnt feel right man
Best team in the WORLD
One more month, baby!  One more month!
I though thiago was going to get injured getting out of the car.
My only hope less injuries to the squad to last for the whole season then at least can win a trophy and challenge man city for the title again
Next season is going to be our comeback
Darwin is looking in the mood
Why Gomes still there
Reds❤
Good luck boys 💪💪 biggest from KENYA🇰🇪
Good
Bajcetic will be a great player.
Welcom back❤
Klopp looks huge
Anyone hearing Jay-Z-Run This Town song in this video😅?
Don McClean and Tracy Chapman
🔥FACT🔥 Messi ordered Argentina squad to stop calling Alexis MacAllister colo (ginger) after he noticed that Alexis doesn’t like it. 🥰 So no one in Liverpool cano should call him that or I’ll text Messi. 🤏
I thought Calvin Ramsey went out on loan?
How is gomez still at Liverpool, hes garbage
คิดถึง​นัก​แตะ​ของเรา BOSS.JK.และทีมงาน เหมือน​เปิดเทอม​ใหม่ และมาวันแรกที่ได้เจอกัน  อยากเห็​นพวกเขา ลงเล่นในสนามแล้ว❤
Great to be back in business again, I think this is going to be a massive season for us as a club pushing forward YNWA
👇♥️We want the new boys♥️👇 🇦🇷 Alexis  🇭🇺 Zo-Bo-Slay
The Boys Are Back in Town! Cmon The Reds! YNWA

I couldn't love this football club more
Салах Трент и Хендерсон тоже интенсивно тренировались во время паузы
Ynwa❤
So Thiago just checked in and then dissapeared?
ไหนข่าวออกมาว่าแรมซี่ปล่อยยืมไม่ใช่เหรอคับ
Sbozslai and mcalister gonna be our next alonso and coutinho!
Congratulations to Harvey Elliott and Curtis Jones, on winning their international trophy.
Where is Thiago
Bajcetic looked pretty healthy.
Who wins the lactate test now that Millie has gone?
ฉันมีความสุขมากที่ได้เห็นทีมรัก ฉันมาจากประเทศไทย🇹🇭❤
0:20 is how I wanna be when I walk into my job
Good to see back guys, may Almighty bless our team this season.I pray so much, so that there should more injuries.
klopp seems in good spirits, maybe a sign of good things to come this season
I f*cking love Klopp so much
Man i hope these guys have agood seson matip joel nunez fab and ramasey
thiago will stay in liveepool?   who knows, please help with the answer 🙏
😁Ahh! The dreaded lactate test. They looked a bit laboured. They need the pace setter and top dog Milly.
Welcome back and all the best for this season.
Good being back🎉😅
First day without bobby smile cry😢
Someone at the Training Centre is a big fan of classic rock - Credence, Jackson Browne, Fleetwood Mac, Don McClean and Dusty Springfield.
ปีนี้เราจะกลับมาทวงแชมป์..❤
♥️ Stefan Bajcetic ♥️  This boy will be majestic like Alexis MacAllister 🤏
I have a good friend with very similar pre season testing.
Nunez will surprise people this season he's top draw boss la
I Love team
9:13 hearing the lassies back in training!!
I miss James Milner.
Im so excited to see them playing again ..  I hope the time passing faster to start the season 😁
1:44 Early Contender for Cleanest Dap Of The Season
More of these types of video's please.
No Milly😭
I thought Fabinho was pregnant with all that "push push push push" 😂😂😂. Good, the boys are back.
7:15 Matip always has someone trying to flirt with him, even without Van Dijk and Konaté around, the man's still getting whistles at camp 😂
2:58 sound?
I will be grateful😅
No Bobby, no party 😢
Milner's lactate tests, gone but never forgotten ✊🏽
🙀
Klopp ❤
Hello my name is Astamir I'm from Russia I've been rooting for Liverpool very much for 4 years can you answer me🙏
This is good to see. Seemed like an age since the 2022/23 season ended.
Good to be back Liverpool
What’s the point of having Thiago when he almost never plays. 😤 Sell him to saudi regime for a billion € 🤏
where is our new guy?
Congratulation to Harvey and Curtis for winning the U21s Euro.
No Milner, no party. 😢
YNWA
What on planet earth is going on with the ear thing??? I'm so confused right now.
the best club in the world ...YNWA 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Love to see Darwin showing up to training camp on Day 1. It speaks to his work ethic & determination to succeed. 🔥
It's great to see the players back in training again, I'm so excited to see them play again and to win Championship too ❤️
J'aime Liverpool ❤❤❤
Let’s go into this season with a VENGEANCE!YNWA!!!
Cmon nunez, I know you can do it. Become the best of the best
Nobody:  Matip: Arughhhhhh
YOU "LL NEVER WALK ALONE LIVERPOOL MY BEST TIME ❤✌❤
I am fully confident that Liverpool this season will win us a championship ❤️
Hope fabinho gets his form and fitness back. He had a nightmare season last season. Hope all the players do themselves justice
Welcome back for pre-season training❤
Please rename the lactate test to the James Milner test
⚠️ Fabinho looks tired 🤦‍♀️ He isn’t himself since he had his new born. Liverpool must higher a babysitter for his kid. His mind obviously occupied & doesn’t sleep enough. 🤏
Can someone explain about what are they doing with the ear😅
The little kiss by the gaffer is what I need for good sleep
Look at Darwin Nunez, he's lost a lot of weight 💀
No thiago
I hope Darwin has a great season. ❤
Please take me to just to do fitness training and check with you!! I will pay you:)
Ola ❤
With all the transfer activities going on, especially seeing Arsenal on a vengeance buying players, does make me a bit anxious about the coming season. However,  honestly seeing some of them back to training I feel relieved. We do have a good squad and an amazing manager, and our forward line up is quite formidable, if they click, we'll actually be a force to be reckoned with. Hoping for the best.

Waiting for champig chapmleag
Looking like Champions League winners
Nice to hear some Doobie Brothers ringing out there.
What's the things on the ears
Want to see action from Calvin Ramsay
Joe Gomez = complete waste of wages. Need to get rid of him ASAP.
Great
No more Milner to run everybody in the ground. Kinda weird.
good luck in europa leauge😀👍
Damn im already missing Milner
I just hope lfc will not disappoint their fans dis season again.
Allllll the Best to Mo Salah and LFC , to a Great Season ahead!!! YNWA ♥️
Good to see the boys coming back!!! Do the new lads join on Tuesday aswell as everyone else? YNWA
Full of happiness❤ love this lads
Nunez is much fitter among them. He didn't even break a sweat. And let's go Ramsay!
where is the new guys? Szobo? McCalister?
Whom will now be the king of the lectate (misspelled I know), now that Milner has left us?😉😂
I was half expecting milly  to turn up for the running competition haha I will definitely miss milly and the other lads who left but I am also excited for the season to start I feel confident that the team and the new players will give us fans a lot of happiness this season that had to of hurt the players and coaches not performing to their normal high standards finger's crossed we get back in the champions league and win a trophy or at least become that team where the other team is scared to play Liverpool again up the reds ❤
10:02 what are they putting on their ears?
I can come to one training with the players
I have a feelinh that we will win the epl this season lets come back this comment as the season progresses
4:40 did fabinho said “no quería volver” ? (I didnt want to come back) 💀
Great to see the lads back🎉🎉🎉
Players walking past the medical room feeling odd that Naby Keita and Ox aren't in there.
Love the drone footage! Really helps show the size of the AXA
The vibes>>>>
Even though he’s gone, James Milner still won the lactate test
❤😊
Thiago??
Back yo welcome xd😅
Um sonho
Fabby about to have a reeeeeaaaallll nice bounce back year…
I recently begun making YouTube videos. Does anyone have advice on how I can improve them?
Liverpool gonna show the world that there are back this season
Lets goooooo boys
Klopps just a chilled out entertainer
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 we miss them during vacation 😭
what is that ear thing ?
They really like naked Nunez and I can't blame them
Nunez 'd better be good this season.
not seeing james milner out run everyone in that running ear poke test... seems weird to me
I am so happy to see them
Nice to see them so tight-knit as a group. But all that hugging would tire me out…
We need new players one each for FW,MF and DF
Milly will be missed in the changing room
Is Liverpool getting Thuram?
When people ask why Adrian gets a new contract this is why, we can only hope he doesn't play more than a couple of games a season but he's a great lad to have about the place whether you like him or not it's important
1:05🤣🤣🤣🤣
One day I’ll be in this videos 🙏,wish y’all a good season let’s go YNWA
Where’s sobo and alexis?
YNWA!!
What the hell is the ear thing they kept doing?
Curtis and Harvey starting as we mean to go on tonight 🏆 great to be back buzzing for this season!
Missing milner
no millie
Welcome back. From Ethiopian
🥰🥰🥰
I think the boys are good to go
Europa league
I thought Calvin Ramsay went on loan?
Who missed Millie in lactate test? 😢
can someone explain to me what are they doing to their ears ? and why only those 4 players ?
Plesee don't hand out any books linders
It's good that they return to training, I hope they win the league this season
To much sun Darwin that sunburn peel look good
YNWA
Anyone knows what's the last test that they were doing? Running for a lap and something to do with the ear lobe.
Where is Thiago Alcantara?
It's gonna be a great season for us. Ynwa
A lot of jay z songs playing here 😅... Anyway can't wait for the new season we gonna dominate lets goo!!!
Waiting for the best
I wrote to Mohamed salah at school and got a team photo as a replie thanks liverpool
Tunes!
Klopp is the best thing to happen to Liverpool since the Premier League started.
As soon as the gaffer gave us a kiss not even 30 seconds into the video, you know we will cook next season!!
I'd love to see those boys keep up with the lads in Special Forces, ok, they are built for speed and a stamina over 90 minutes, but not for speed and stamina over 72 hours, I'm ex forces but not special and I reckon I could outlast any of those guys in a fitness test, they also don't have to carry 40-60lb of webbing and equipment on their back either :)
Bro, Darwizzy is so cute with his “wow wow wow”.  His English is so good!
J. Gomes trim that beard brother!
No way Darwizzy dosent score 30 plus best season
Wish you a Great Season! YNWA
"Here they go , packing stadiums as Shady spits his flow" ❤❤ I love the fact that they working up to Forever some serious hip hop hits there 😊
What is the thing they were doing with their ears?
I love our team to the core, especially their chemistry. I'm sure we'll do great this season, let's go Reds! ♥
Who won the lactate test then lads
Too bad Calvin is being loaned out
Dont know why as soon as klopp said good morning it bought a big smile to my face welcome back to all 😊
❤❤❤❤🇮🇳
Darwin looks like a stamina monster.. Didn't look tired once in lactate test
Wonder who gets the beep test this year now Millie's left?
Missing bobby and milner on the pitch
No Milner to set the pace you can really see it. That man was a machine😢
Curtis Jones winning us the U21 Euros 💪 UP THE SCOUSERS YNWA
Welcome back boys
Give Darwin the 9!
Welcome back boys. Hopefully the 23/24 seasons well be good
Go Go Go Europa 🎉🎉🎉
We need a defensive midfielder and a center back
No James Milner anymore 😢
Oh Lord, please bless us with an injury free season, so we can achieve all our goals this season, in Jesus name, amen.
Shouldn’t Ramsay be at Preston?
What happening at the end with the staff pinching their ears? are they taking blood samples after each run?
please more training vlogs
WHat are the blood samples from their ear lobes for?
Kloop looks like that cool dad who your friends want to hand out with , but you know that he could still your GF
It happened what happened, now it’s a new season and let’s not repeat the same mistakes! We’ve signed a few good players (Thank God🙏🏻) we also have a few veryyy good players!  Please lads, take it easy but seriously this year!
Sign Lavia
Great to have the guys back
I thought Ramsey was out on loan.
In side news, James Milner still won the lactate challenge despite being a Brighton player. It is rumored he ran the test himself remotely and took his own readings, sending in the results via the group LFC players Whatsapp.
Kloppage looks energized,lets gooooooooooo boys............YNWA
that group running session remind me of James Milner. :(
What are they doing with there ears ?
I can't wait to see SOBOSLY and MAC ALLIESTER.❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love Liverpool If you love Liverpool like this comment

Not seeing Milner on the blood lactate test is kind of sad.
