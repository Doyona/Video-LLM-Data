Check out Part 2 for even more Palworld Tips and Tricks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8Ey9kUS09U
why would you want to turn off death penalty? Death should have consequences, whats the point if you rip the challenge?!
One extra tip: whenever you have to repair some of your equipment, take a look if you can craft a best tier one first, that way you don't waste resources.
Too funny "Swany", was my nickname one upon a time. Wonder if your last name is swan? 🤔
Tht exploit has been patched u can no longer jump on a sphere an be launched 😭
Best guide so far
Not one of these tips is “advanced” every tip you have didn’t get out of mid game. You still don’t really know what you’re doing. Everything you said was about early game lmfao. So dumb.
Unintentionally, I believe Sparkit is a great lesson in using terrain to avoid attacks. It has an attack that hits in a wide arc, and you first encounter it in an area with tons of trees
You can feed them skill fruits i gave a free pal alliance crusher a beam attack and hes like my highest dps pal.
I didnt know latern exist till I watch this videi I though it only for decorate
Dont dissemble your stairs that’s at the bottom of your base unless you want your entire 3 floors above erased in a second like me !!! 😮😮😮
ive owned this game for 50 hours. have played for 24 hours already lol.
Going back and getting your stuff after dying is severe enough I changed it pretty early on 💯
How do you lock on? I didn’t know it was in the game
I should probably start capturing things..ive been killing everything
That ore and coal location was absolutely amazing thanks for that one
This has aged like milk
Well I learned something new today. I bet it's better to use the grappling hook rather than a katana. Lol
got this recently on the ps5 and have been struggling to break ground thankful for this guide to help me truly get started
I've put almost a full 5 days straight into this addictive game and this is absolutely the best tip guide I've seen. I will definitely subscribe to your channel. Great job brother.
Did they patch the trick to die and pick a new spawn point? It did not work for me :(
I’m not even level 30 and I’m almost a day 100
The dying and fast travel point dont work anymore
I didn’t have shields for the longest time. For some reason I thought it was for the base.
I have played some. I have had a lot of fun. Plus now playing with my husband wow amazing game.
⚠️ANOTHER TIP⚠️ use pal as gliders and use the pal condenser to combine the pals and make them stronger the best glider in the game is Galeclaw you get it around level 20 he’s a pal
öm its not big masteik and im talkkiang about the first own you now the item thing you now wen you dai than you drop your all items bat thäts no a broblem because wen befor you ewen go to your world you can change your settings so yeah gg bayyyy
When you said slide Into glider just use grappler into glider it takes more skill🙄🙄🙄🙄   16:21Just turn your brightness up💀💀💀💀   16:46No way guys I just learned about their drop button Just go back for the loot💀💀💀💀💀   18:20I actually didn't know that    19:37Go into a dungeons Sometimes something called a lotus spawns They sell for 5K... They're not that rare😂😂😂😂
You can catch a green frog that has a move to launch you into the air no ball needed 😂
Building on ore doesn't matter once you can build ore mines in you're own base 😊
If you find a cave or cave entrance to a boss mark the entrance with a cave sign on the map, it makes it much easier to farm them 😊
Carry the ingredients to make a pal box so if you cant beat something put down a pal box summon 20 pals, throw out your pal and fuck it up 😂
Levelling up is simple just catch 12 of every pal you see and you'll be level 60 in no time 😊
Put the camp fires behind and beside the egg incubator or you'll keep catching on fire and pals can catch on fire and burn your base down too 😊
You have to capture 12 of thenpals for the xp boost not 10 😂
With the pal box just go to sort on the top right corner click it, then choose what job or element pal you want and hit sort, it will sort pals into order no need to fuck around with it, and its not hard to find what you're looking for 😊
Just make night time last twice as long and fly around, you'll find all effigies easy asf 😊
U can use clouds you create to quick travel back from any spot no point dying 😂
Upgrading the shield is useless it's one hit and its gone, and armour breaks after 2 or 3 hits so Upgrading is pointless other than for looks 😊
Only have 4 bases, only have 20 pals per base, only have 3,000 items in you're game 😉😏, no glitches, rubber banding or dropping out on these settings 😊
It's it bad to say most of this is common sense. Like if you don't already know most of this in your first couple minutes of play than damn you stupid.
Cant wait
How do you get more than one pal  in your party out at a time?
Are boss versions actually stronger? For me it always looks like they have the same stats as others of the same type.
Killing your self to explore the map is so fkn lame. Just explore the game man
I think they changed the respawn locations because I tried it last night and it only gave me one respawn and it was the starting location Also instead of using cats in your ranch, use vixys, they dig up pal sheres, gold coins, and arrows.
8:11 you should play the PC version they have all sorts of sorting options.  So far we're up to 24 on the PC version per base, It's going up more once we upgrade the pal box The limitations the consoles have make this game not so much fun.
21:11 does that work for anything?
18:31 if I didn't see it i wouldn't have believed it
14:24 you monster
13:05 i wish i knew that before lmao
I caught 5 merchants and i don't regret it
My house keeps despawning and my stuff ends up on the floor idk why any help
Can anyone still do the dupe glitch?
4:25 You Know What Else Is Massive?
How did you have multiple pals join you for the zoe fight?
Boss farming tip was 👌👌
Another great Tip. Galeclaw Gloves is a relatively early game item that you can craft, and allows you to use your Galeclaw as a Glider, and it basically works as one of the higher end gliders, only you can get it way earlier. If you prefer height to speed, or want to abuse Grappling Hooks Momentum, use a Hangum instead, because it gives you height each time you pull it out, allowing you to get height quickly if you pull it out and put it up repeatedly.
They changed that feature you cant unlock free travel points from dying anymore now you have to actually find them and when you die you can only go to your bases only or the beginning point
If you’ve just started the game I can’t recommend turning off the death penalty because it just takes the fun out of it
Is this a "pay to win" game?
*custom settings
Up to 50 pal in one base
Turned off dropped loot as soon as I found out. I’ll leave that to Elden ring😂 or maybe a challenge playthrough
Just got the game on ps5. Like it a lot
Thanks, there were some great tips.
The thing I’m worrying about is building bro💀
If you're encumbered at base without a grapple gun and have a pal out whose job is 'transporting', just drop some items. You'll be light and that pal will eventually grab and store your stuff away.
i turned off death penalty, but i didn´t know early and i just made new armor to get to mount obsidian to take my inventory back,...never again, turned off egg incubation time and that is all.
The only thing that bugs me about this game is the same thing that bugs me about most modern games. No matter how fun they make them, or how adjustable the difficulty is, the creators abandon all sense and logic when it comes to what they WANT you to perceive as epic moments in the game.  I'll give you an example. This game uses the same exact mechanics as pokemon. So if you are going to a boss battle with an electric type boss, then obviously you want to focus your strategy on the effective type against electric. So you take a ground type with you. But nope, it's a bossfight, it's supposed to be hard.  But I have the type advantage over the boss. Don't care, boss fight... hard. Ok, but in addition to the type advantage, I have a level advantage.  Don't care, boss fight... hard... dramatic. So what is the use of types at all to begin with? You use types to strategize against your opponents so you can have an advantage over them. Don't care... boss fight... hard... dramatic... equal.
If you're very quick with your hands (and even then its a bit of a lucky given, depending on the angle you chose, how soon or late you pulled out the glider and to avoid auto-grappling onto anything) but if you grapple to a tree and then pull out the glider and steer past the tree, you'll go incredibly fast.
Captures humans don’t use weaponry they use their melee attack
This game is so easy to no life
10:38  you can up the amount in custom settings. I capped mine at 50 so I’m level 16 and I have 20 pals working my base
Now that i play on ps5. Only 5 gigs and the game feels so good compared to modern day AAA games. Wtffffff
Here from the ps5!!!!!
Well i already made the first mistake
How are ur pal spheres white
There was 911 comments and I don't want something bad to happen to this vid😅😅😅😅
I would reccomend not turning off the death penalty but changing it to where you lose your items but not gear allowing you a fighting chance at recovering items
Just figured out today that you get like 10X more experience for catching pals than you do for killing them.  At least for the first 12 pals.  Makes leveling mid to late game way faster.
A few simple tip/suggestions. Don't ignore night time and set your game to mostly day you'll need some of the night mobs mats or you might need them. Don't panic in any fight simply  look around for cover like a tree or post  hid behind and take pot shots.I highly suggest some sort of ranged weapon early as possible to pull down a flying foe to get a fly mount. Finally don't bother reading all those exploit tips almost nothing works after several patches.Oh one more tip  try to keep in mind your button to remove your Pal because sooooo many times my Pal will just kil everything so if I want to tame it I have to remove my Pal when HP gets sort of low.
Game is still extremely famous  And I love it
I feel like you didn’t follow the guide at all… both the glider and shield were recommended to make immediately…
I really hate that my flyer needs stamina to fly and is basically stuck to the ground even with infinite stamina perk  🙃 they should do it like ark where stamina is only used when u go fast and do abilities
I capped the last boss 0:50
For me in the first 40h a big quality of life setting was stamina running out so quickly I put the slider as low a possible and it made so much difference. Is there one for duraliby on items?
First step and I stopped video, maidenless behavior fs
I have a illegal tips for Coin 😅 Capture the black market trader using hanger and place campfire below they start burning and taking damage and last 10-30% health give some damage when they die you will get 11k yo 15k coins Instantly
Best line and advice of video "piss off a Pal". Love it 😂
The up high thing is only kind of true. If  you are too high up, it won't always render chests and whatnot. So while it can be useful to se lifmonks and just see the terrain, you will miss tons of stuff  by not ground traveling.
Actually, I have a habit of restarting and making new toons. I almost always find myself in a situation where I'll go to jump off something and remember, oh yeah, I don't have the glider yet. Goodbye cruel world.
i started playing 2 hours ago.    this video kinda feels like cheating haha 😂
How is Faleris so fast in intro ? Totally fast as Jetragon.
Wait.  Your first tip is change the rules? When you can’t do something cheat right?   Wow. If your first tip to get through a game is change the world rules, your tips are worthless. You’re not helping people through the game. Are you even able to play it on normal settings, Or did you beat it by cheating yourself?  Way to make a joke of your own channel dude.   Epic fail.
Hew cenay get in free
Can you control where your pal farms the wood or stone? Seems like my pal wanders to different areas, so I don't know where would be a good spot to place a storage box.
This video is still useful even after playing for 2months
8:43 Okay bro...
Good to see Owen Wilson branching out
Your fault for not having a Series X. That’s what it needs for RAM. Silly point by you.
That Pal Sphere glitch reminds me of the oblivion paintbrushes and skyrim's do not delete chests
"Don't go 7 or 8 hours into your playthrough without building a shield"  To late....😂
How much did it cost to have Owen Wilson narrate this video?
12:34 literally earth benders
Great tutorial for beginners! Glad I caught this prior to really getting into the game! Thanks!
My cousin got aught me most of this but I learned a lot
Should I use another armor in my shield slot?
You could get celray and the gloves so you get an infinite durability glider
ok but what's the best way to increase the weight you can carry??? and how do you stop the game from crashing when you go into caves?
Tip: Be mindful of your base level. Testing currently to how raids work and so far appears to be linked.
the boys dont wna play this w me :/ single player it is
its not meow its mah MAU good tips though.
Started playing with my Daughter a few days go. This was VERY informative. Thank you for sharing with us.
The scorching eggs need the heat barrel to be hatching faster not just a campfire. also the barrel has to be continously fired up by a fire pal.
GET. THE. GALECLAW. GLIDER.
bro thanks so much. I didnt know what the effigies were for and i have over 60 stored on me
does duplication still works?
I would probably forget about capturing merchants to put in you base. They take up a valuable spot in your base that can be used by someone with L4 handiwork since humans have L1 handiwork and only handiwork. There is always a teleportal next to a merchant so no need to keep one in your base.  Another tip to keep Jormantide from getting stuck on top of the silo or shipping container. For the silo, I place foundation and box it in with 4 walls and a roof. I then build the silo on top of the roof. He hasn't gotten stuck there for me anymore. For the shiping container I do similar. I would just put the container under 2 roof tiles that completely covers the container then put stairs so anyone who does get stuck up there can easily get back down.  Hungry pals in you team will put a red text box in the middle of you screen saying "Pal Team is Hungry" Oh and mounted Pals will not automatically eat. You will have to dismount or feed them manually.
I’m late to the game and started like a week ago or a little more and didn’t look at anything before I started and I made everything in my favor, full XP no die stuff etc and my friend was like “WHAT? YOU CAN DO THAT?” Bahahaha. Why wouldn’t you. End game is kind of a thing here.
How were you able to use multiple types of pals in that grizzbolt fight?
This stream is actually Owen Wilson and is pretending we wouldn't notice...
Food spoilage timers were the only thing I wanted to change in the settings, and they're not there 😢
I thought the shield was a normal combat shield for the longest time. I prefer dodging over blocking in most games, so I didn't even bother unlocking them. That could have been indicated better in the in-game description.
Owen Wilson with the clutch guide!
If I could like this video 10 times I would lol. Thank you for this!
I don't know what you're doing wrong man. I'm closing in on level 40 and levels are so fast. I level up every hour easily. Didn't touch the settings for XP or spawn rates.
Not dropping your stuff on death feels like cheating... If you played minecraft everyone thought you were cheating or not taking the game seriously if you had keep inventory on
Alright we get it, you kind of sound like owen wilson
gonna be honest i always thought the shield was like a base shield and never bothered to actually make it, and then always found myself complaining about dying
You can change it to cap at 20 pals at your base
15 isnt the max pals per base, it's 20
Shields are soooo good in this game , just got palworld today and i’m glad i crafted it so early into the game combined with the rolling button. Also the egg tip with campfires is clutch! I tried turning enemies against eachother with npc and the mammoth and the mammoth just slammed them 😭
How do you send out multiple pals
BRO, I LEARNED A TON OF STUFF FROM YOU... TY
booooooo exploits
your dodge would be much more effective than jump gliding two feet
Awake at 3am watching your vids
I imagine you looking like Owen Wilson. 😅
I’m two weeks in on series X not one crash bro. It’s your internet connection
My Xbox never has crashed but have went through ground a lot
I've felt ready burned out because I love this game but getting player exp has been a chore with me needing to catch pals over and over again wasting materials just to level up once but now that I know you can change exp gain it should help a ton
On the tip with turning your death penatly off to get those fast travels, you could do what i did early on. Kill yourself through the pause menu in your base. Respawn at a different area get the fast travel, rinse and repeat to all the locations.  Once you are done you can get your loot back at the base
I wish there were any black npcs to catch.
Holy crap. Great video. Gladly give you a sub... DUDE. I'm an ARK survivor, so when i hear shield... i think of something that you block with. I had no idea it was like a halo overshield. I'm level 30... guess I'll go make that now... 😅
Hey guys! I don’t wanna be that annoying guy, but I made some videos I think you might like. I’m a new channel so any advice would be appreciated!
Skip the glider, get a Vanwyrm. Fly around to your heart's content with an unlimited ammo bomber.
Here's a tip from me. Set your EXP to 0.8 at the most, and possibly even lower. At the standard setting of 1.0, I gained EXP so quickly that it felt like I couldn't fully appreciate each level of technology. Things became obsolete too rapidly.
Can't say this helped me at all as all these tips were common sense that happens with the game as you start out. but I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Well made 🙏 if you have any tips on how to get pals to get the ore digtoise gathers faster lmk 😆
These aren't tips and tricks, these are ways to break the game. This dude's just a cheater.
These tips are great can’t wait to use them in my play through
Extra tip: of you're cold or hot, having an ice or fire pal out near you will shift your temperature. I made the heat resist armor cause I liked the colour, but didn't realize it meant I was worse off in the cold than just the normal armor, but just having my fox out made me warm, not even holding him, just having him out of the ball.
Turning pals against each other is the best strat in the game. No joke I caught many pals while way under their level by just shooting one and standing behind another, pals often spawn in pairs or groups so it's actually pretty easy to do, then just let them duke it out and pray that your 3% catch rate works before you mistime or legit miss throwing your next ball and they manage to get a shot off and kill you lol.   But for a while I had a lot of "level sync issues" in my palbox using this method.   Nothing in this video was news to me, but still good video lol.
I've gotten to level 38 and I don't have a shield or glider lol. I've also not caught a full 10 of one pal
Promoting exploits letting alone  using them is just irresponsible.
Yeah man. I’m convinced you could do a killer Owen Wilson impression
I didn’t realize I beat the first syndicate tower boss so early. I don’t know how lucky I got but I beat it at like level 12-14. I might buy a lottery ticket now
For those unaware, the effigies are currently bigger and actually decrease capture power. Wait for a patch to use them
Use the dodge button to dodge? Stellar advice. Should I use the jump button to jump as well?
That's where I made my mine😂
Just get a pistol 😀
So basically in this game : you shoot or beat something or even someone up, you capture them, you bring them to your camp, you make them work for you in your camp, you make them fight other creatures or humans, you even get to decide what they will eat. I don't know but for others but that reminds me of a little something called "sla**ry" 😂😂😂 or at least "colon**ism". I personally don't really care, but I'm surprised it didn't generate more concern from "woke" medias.
Sorry, but I’ve been playing on the Xbox version two and it hardly ever crashes. I have over 2 1/2 days of gameplay in the game 1000 gamers store maxed out everything have everything in the game done with everything still playing the game caught everything but I’ve only crashed and literally a few times. And one thing I have not messed with any of those settings.
💀 this whole time you can slide? That’s crazy.
super super helpful ty!
The narrator of this video sounds like Owen Wilson
Tip, don’t get a glider, get a pal as a glider like celaray as it is faster than the best glider and it’s easier to get which is insane
good tipp is. let your pal use all abilitys then ride on him. Then all ability have 0 CD. Use all skills and then jum off. then the pal has all skills avaible again.
I like how the like button lit up when you said to hit that like button at 0:30. That was crazy cool.
Making my enemies fight each other is how I got through the first 10 levels 😅
Real talk, the fear of losing items when you die is part of the fun
18:05 WOW I might never have figured that out, thanks a ton!
Swany i crashed 12-13 times in one session Me (ark player) thats it??? 😂
I’ve used my glider a total of 5 times I’ve had it for probably 15 hours of game time
In customization menu you can up helper pals to 20
went 50 hrs so far in the game without a shield, decided to fight mammorest (lvl 40) at lvl 25 with nothing but a musket, an axe and one pal, managed to axe it without taking any damage, I AM THE GOD OF WAR.
Can you lock on a target if playing with joypad on PC?
You dont need ancient technolgy to build the statue..lmao
Why is Owen Wilson telling me how to play Palworld?
Whats multiplayer like? Are you on the same team? Seperate factions? I play in Game Pass Cloud Streaming
Unfortunately (not sure if you put it in your pt 2) the effigies are bugged, even now. Where gathering more of them and upgrading the capture power actually decreases the catch rate, instead of increasing it. It is HIGHLY not recommended to even gather them or upgrade the statues dotted across the world. Just leave it alone for now til the company is aware of the bug and fixes it.
14:30 hurt my soul
How to get saved and be right with God for eternal life! As anyone can get saved! 1-Admit you’re a sinner and be willing to turn from your own self righteousness to God. 2-Believe onto Jesus Christ, who being the only begotten Son of God, died on the cross, was buried and resurrected for the full forgiveness of our sins as a free gift out of God’s love for us. 3-Confess onto God, asking to be saved accepting this free gift of salvation, to start a new life of being born again, after being saved from your sins.  (The romans road to salvation from the King James Bible.) Romans 3: 10-12+23 (KJB) 10. "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:" 11."There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God." 12."They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one." 23. “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.”  Romans 5: 8-9+12 (KJB) 8. “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." 9."Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him." 12. “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for all that have sinned:”  Romans 10: 9-10+13 (KJB) 9. “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” 10."For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." 13."For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  Romans 6: 23 (KJB) “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.”  (An example of what to pray to God to get saved and forgiven of your sins.) “Dear God, I am a sinner and need saving. I know I’m not good enough to get to heaven and I need you to save me. I need the righteousness of your son, Jesus Christ.I believe that Jesus is the Lord, who died, was buried and resurrected so that his precious blood can wash away my sins. I trust in him alone to save me. Nothing else. Not my good works or anything else. Only Jesus. I pray this in Jesus’ name, Amen.”  (More related scripture.) John 3: 15-17 (KJB) 15."That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life." 16."For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life." 17."For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”  1 Corinthians 15: 1-4 (KJB) 1."Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2."By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.” 3."For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;” 4."And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:”  Hebrews 9: 27-28 (KJB) 27."And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:" 28."So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.”  Ephesians 2: 8-9 (KJB) 8."For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:" 9."Not of works, lest any man should boast.”  Revelation 21: 8 (KJB) "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.”
No offense i am not going to turn off death penalty, feels like cheating to me. The girls don't like that shi*.
The grind IS THE FUN
21:14
It's an ok tiers tips video , although i strongly recommand NOT to change any settings in your world especially loot dropping on deeath. Its part of the game and desined like that , dont cheat like he said and teleport everywhere its not how it supposed to work and you will miss tons of shinies , chest and everything just be carefull and dont push too much like a minecraft game :P
Why are most people trying to speedrun this game? Isn’t it more fun to make the game harder and discover each area 1 by 1? I see most people rushing to complete the game within a week. I just don’t get it
Anyone want an invite code for a map decently discovered with beginning bosses all there ready and tons of resources waiting as starter.
Fog was used to cover heavy impact on rendering far objects. With the new ue5 u have nanites as sort of render technic. Its easy on the gpu/cpu load and can render targets up to 4k if iam correct without getting much loss. Just as Info :D
Love the video. Very helpful! But please, don't do the duplication glitch. The game was made so that you go out and get stuff. This will kill the game for you fast
For anyone thag may be wondering the earliest flying pal will be nightwing i think they start spawing at level 10, and the item is unlocked at 15
How can I have multiple pals out ?
Weirdly, no crashes on my end. The game pass version might be bugged, but here has been great since launch day. I even host a dedicated from my PC and the worst I see is mild lag from my ISP. I recommend you look into all of your drivers, top to bottom, and ensure nothing is bugged
the reason why no number of camp fires is hot enough for the scorched eggs is because the game only considers unique number of hear sources rather than brute quantity of the same types DO NOT stack, consider a heater and camp fire combo
Fun fact, there is a bug with the effigies right now where upgrading your capture power has the opposite effect. For now, collect all of them that you can, but don’t actually apply them until it’s fixed!
Comment because I heard it's good for you😅
Never crashed on gamepass pc edition, fix ur pc
You cannot stack the same types of heat sources (for example 5 campfires). You have to use different types of heat sources.
How do you have multiple boxes? I tried to put a second box down after watching your video in my bass and it won't allow it Are you talking about multiple bases?
I’ve reached level 32. the entire time, I didn’t have a shield because I thought the shield was for the base! 🤣 No wonder ive been DYING so much
i'm at level 24 now and finally i'm understanding the shades of this game
Jesus Christ loves you so much that he died on the cross for your sins❤️
all I wanted to know was how to PLACE them into the pen. googled it; you have to LIFT them up, and toss them into the pen.
If you catch a pal merchant or black marketer you can reset their pal stocks by just putting them back in your box and pulling them back out instead waiting for the normal cycle reset
Im just gonna say that even early on, Mau isnt a great income source.  If you need cash and dont own a Flambelle, go get one. or four.  dealers choice.  Anyways, a Mau digs up like 10-20 coins a pop, a Flambelle drops a Flame Organ that sells for 40g? I think it was every time.  Just saying.  The Mau Cryst apparently can dig up Sapphires though which do sell well but I havnt personally confirmed it nor really care cause by the time I even had one, I was flush with cash.  For a somewhat 'exploitive' way to make easy money, you can setup an ore farm base, make lots of ingots, make nails, sell nails.  Currently nails sell for 160g each, so 320g per ingot, making you more than any one particular ammo type costs per ingot without the hassle of gunpowder.  Now Coarse might be better to craft based on number per craft vs selling nails, but any other ammo type, its better to make nail and sell nails for buying the ammo in question.  The only ammo type not sold by any merchant iv come across are Rockets for Rocket Launchers.  Oh and poison arrows.  Dont think iv seen those but iv also never used or made them.
They need to fix bases and pals. Example every time you load into the base the pals gets moved around and have a chanse of getting stuck either outside the walls under the map or on the roof and wont move untill you move them manually
Thanks for the tips! Now,I can farm fast❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I thought this game would have pvp...... sadly it doesn't look like there's any end game stuff at all. Hope they change this cause it kinda looks boring.
Still crashing on Feb 4th 2024
Can you sell a captured merchant to a merchant
My egg 1sec born
Ew, only filthy ppl dupe. Cmon guys, have some god damn Tegridy
ALSO I HEARD UPGRADING YOUR CATCH CHANCE, ACTIVELY NERFS YOUR CATCH CHANCE. COLLECT BUT DONT SPEND THE LIF EFFIGIES
Awesome video! But don’t listen to him on the NO DEATH PENALTY. What? You think mama raised a bitch?
Be a TRUE PalChad, rock the default settings. DROP IT ALL ON DEATH
If you change the default settings, you’re no better than people that play PEACEFUL ON MINECRAFT
So is this Ark with Pokemon ???
How did you have several pals during the boss fight??
Not a single crash on my Xbox X nor PC Steam and yes, I have  double digit game play hours
One thing to add is that the pal stats that affect the player stack up. 5 pals with mining foreman gives 125% mining speed. Strong strategist can go up to 50% added defense. And so on.
bro is playing on a toaster
Great video, thanks!
Make the mistakes. Enjoy the game. No need to be perfect from the start. It will get boring.
From my experience the humans they do help with   Handy work all the building stuff, I captured 2
The number of Pals at base you can change it in the options
That item dupe glitch really made my day here, and one that I would never discover myself 😮
What do you mean by different pal boxes? I assumed thought they were one per base and those are linked
you better turn off keep inventory brother
Nah, go make mistakes. Go do things wrong. Go do things your own way. Learn from them. Make yourself better by understanding things. You play much lesser when you start at peak efficiency because there's no room for improvement.
14;11, thanks for this bit of Info, because a bunch of Idiots I know said the Food Pouch was to feed YOU, and not your pets. this makes more sense.
Played for my first time today fror 5 hours, the only thing I've learned from this is the thing with the scorch eggs at the vulcano, but I'm an ark player so most of the stuff it's to be expected
Wow this video was super helpful and definitely made me go back to playing the game. Just got a follow from me
11:05 One campfire is enough; heat sources do not stack.  14:24 How did you not notice them starving when you have to feed yourself significantly more often? All the hunger bars are right there when you're eating something.
Pal: did you just catch a human Me with intense twitchy stare: gotta catch em all
Step 1: Dont be gay.
You do relize there is ann actual dodge right but great video otherwise.
bruh im level 27 and still havent touched any shields 💀 oops
Dont sprint when flying on a flying mount, u can stay in the air wayyyyy longer if u dont use sprint while flying. Flying uses stamina slowly, but sprint flying is a super drain on your mount stamina.  Also for palbox management, sorting by element seems to be the most efficient sorting method.
didn't know Owen Wilson made tutorials XD thanks for the tips!
What an epic game
Xbox game pass games do that when you playing with friends,a lot a small fix to crashing is to start the game and then open task manager and “end task” windows explorer the game does not crash after that you can test it it’s a 100% fix
Pro tip if you start your game fresh, your immediate goal should be to utilize the cave black marketeer glitch. Tens of thousands of gold, tons of XP, baaically free gold, xp, and Pals. Just collect food in your way and boom, immediately you basically have mid gsme levels and unlock dozens of levels and player stat points.
12 to 13 times? Wtf? I only crashed once and thats when I was closing down the game. Thats messed up
The egg part. Campfires do not stack on the heat. You need different points of heat. So one campfire and one cooking pit. 10 campfires only count as one campfire as far as eggs are concerned. I do not know if it was patched out.
10:36 - you can increase the maximum Pal limit at bases by changing the Custom Difficulty settings for you world.  Max base pals is at the very bottom, past death penalty.
I captured Zoe and and Grizzbolt and they have like over 100k health!!
I caught a guy with a flame thrower and he just used it to beat other guys and not actually use it.
I hate that Xbox doesn’t have MP
I know im addicted to the game when it crashes 15-20 times a day and I just keep loading back in😂
Does the duplication glitch still work with the new update?
12:07 how do you have multiple pals out at once in the fight?
Ama9zng video, but the heat for hatching tip is wrong. One type of source of fire does not stack. 1 campfire give same heat as 5. You need to build diferent heat sources(camp fire, Cauldron, torch, etc)
I think everyone should play the game and learn for themselves. Imagine how boring it makes a game to play exactly like someone else. Just experiment with shit and have fun people.
You almost sound like Owen Wilson.
I think the crashing might be mostly on multiplayer. I've been playing since launch on xbox gamepass/pc only on singleplayer and I've only had 3 or 4 crashes total in that time and I've played every day
8:33 or just use the sort funtion by lvl or element aka type
Thank you!
U walk faster encumbered now
no death penalty?noob
Great video, agreed on it all.  Around 6:10, you say to let yourself die. To do that you can also go to the options menu and telling it to respawn. And at 10:40 on the Xbox at least you can up the number of Pals to 20 in the options before you load your game and you can force your Pal to work on specific projects by tossing them at it. At 13:30 if you place a bin adjacent to your fast travel or base terminal, you can put more weight than you can walk with but you will be able to fast travel to a base where you toss it to another bin to use. Also, if you jump off a cliff and grab it before the ground you'll be just fine! Good video!
Last one is basically hack bro 😅
Bro I was already at level 27, but there A LOT of things I didn't know. Thank You Very Much ❤
Is this game available  on ps4 or ps5
Another Beginner Tip: Be careful when clicking *Repair All* - If you have a Shield, it will use Ancient Technology pieces to repair it when it is only slightly damaged (when most of you other gear only uses simple resources to repair).
Does changing the world settings disable the achievements on xbox?
11:11 I heard a tip for heating eggs that multiple of the same heating source (i.e. 2 campfires, torches, etc.) dont stack- so have 1 torch, 1 campfire, 1 wall torch, 1 heater, etc. to increase incubating
The paid version on PC doesn't crash, I played for over 30 hours in one sitting and had 0 crashes.
“Things started to slow down for me around my mid 20’s”  Same bro, same…
When I listen to some of these YouTubers, y’all really aren’t great at these games lol mechanically. 1-30in this game base stats is a breeze. Starving pals? Lol  The map is small if you actually pay attention to distance traveled on the map as your moving. Just feels big. Fast travel everywhere. Constantly dieing? I don’t even build my first legit base till level 18-20. Just a camp to start with workbench’s, pal gear, and furnace, plus stuff to level the base up and delete. Get myself outfitted with 200ish basic pal balls, 300+ arrows, full gear, catch most of the starters to completion and then move out and build my first base out of stone. I only build that first pal box so I can have pals working on my fist load out while I’m out leveling to 18-20
Yep ima need my shield
Hatching scorch eggs, use heaters and assign fire pals to keep them warm. 2 seems to work well for me
Everytime I go in a dungeon, my game crashes, I hate it
You can have up to 20 pals in your base, update it on the world setting all the way at the bottom
thx
Thanks Owen Wilson!
just a little somewhat helpful bug i found. If you use the sort button with items that decay mainly food items, it will reset the countdown to when it spoils.
Another tip for when you're over-encumbered is to mount onto direhowl (?  Think that's his name)  You can use his lunging attacking to travel a decently large distance.
They really should’ve made a companion for each class
The cap for pals at the base is actually 20. But you have to go into the world settings and change it. The default is 15 though.
Also when it comes to using a fire type to see in the dark, later on in the game you can unlock the “hip lantern”
PLEASE be careful when using campfires inside a wooden house, I learned the hard way
I just got suicide-bombed by a rainbow bird.
Definitely not turning off the death penalty. Removes all the challenge of this being a survival game and turns it into a sandbox. Its like turning on keep inventory in minecraft it might be convenient but it just feels like youre playing the game wrong. I can explore and find new spawn points and locations with my legs.
"next tip: turn off death penalty"  me: *turns off video*
I got a shiled before the video but I just thought it was like shield u could use with the spear but ehh
i did not know you can put campfires in your wooden base lol, i keep seeing people accidently burn their base down
you are able to Increase the amount of pals in your base, if you so wish. Its in the Custom Server Settings. Although you can only bump it up to 20. but that's still pretty good, considering. you get 5 more pals that could work for you. As for the Performance issues, you spoke of, I haven't had any yet.
Heat sources dont stack with the themselves 2 campfires will only count as 1 heat source so you need a heater and campfire for two levels of heat
I’m on Xbox game pass too and I have crashed 6 times in a half hour. I’m ready to just stop playing bro😭
My tip for you: exploit glitches…
12 to 13 crashes, is on you. Your system. Not the game. Im on gamepass as well and ive only crashed once. Like at all.
saying the game has had a bad launch is a heavy take considering it hasnt launched yet. just early access beta.
11:15 Fake news - Adding multiple campfires does not stack heat. You need heat sources with different names. So a campfire and a heater together will make it hotter than either, but 500 heaters is the same heat as 1 heater.
I did the same thing, I didn't make a shield until the T2 shield (second upgrade) and I didn't know about the dodge until about level 30 and I the whole time I thought to myself "this game is PokeSouls" because of how often I was dying or how impactful each bit of damage felt. I actually was running around with a Pal that had a healing ability for my HP b/c I thought that was the way to play.
max your exp immediately. there isn't a single reason not to. reduce the egg timer down to 0. there's no good reason to have a timer. Max out player stamina. it's just an annoyance. also saves you level up stat points. you can increase max pal at base to 20.  if you're farming dungeons, you don't need maus' in your base.
A good tip for Pal Box organisation is to keep all your combat Pals / adventuring squad in Box 16 (the last box, which is also one tab to the left of box 1 where it always opens). This makes accessing your combat Pals for base defence / fights much quicker.  I also keep Box 1 clear, as this is where Pals go when you capture them while you have a full party. It makes it easier to go through the news ones when you next return to base.
How can you have three pals helping you out fight the boss?
During the boss battle how did you have three pals out?
You can set your hatch to instant as soon as you put it in its done
"Get a flying pal asap"..... well DUH, you should maybe mention which is fastest to get and where to get.
Wheres the iptions for the death penalty???? My options only give me keyboard and controller options 😂 wtf
Thanks hoss
I'm getting ark ptsd from the amount of ingots I need to have.
Respect up until the duping exploit 🤣
you can also breed your pals and catched humans! mammorest + rookie = FUN!!! + you can have 20 pals in base you just have to adjust your world settings
I know this is a week old…but extra campfires don’t make it hotter. You have to build different heat sources, such as the heater.
Honestly haven’t had one crash yet.
You can sell pals ????
You cannot craft lifmunk effigies
The killimari pal with the gloves to use it was the best glider we've found so far. It glides 5 times further than the second glider.
My biggest tip, buy the PC version so you can download nexus mods. The AlwaysFastTravel mod makes the game more enjoyable.
I’ve never liked survival games but I am addicted to this
Don't know if it's been mentioned yet, and this comment will probably never see the light of day, BUT... as of writing this, you can fully refresh the spoil duration on all of the food in your inventory by hitting the sort button. You can also move them into a chest and back. This also works on food in chests.
Just buy its 30.00 that's what 1 trip to taco bell with 2 people.
Hey it was mentioned that you should lock on to the enemy around the 4 minute mark in the video, how do you do this on XBOX???
Craft daedreams necklace and keep it in the party.  Daedream will always stay out even using other pals.
This game is just ark survival evolved but pokemonified
Campfires don't stack; though I heard having a roof and/or using a Heater gives more heat.
I'm almost 60hrs in great game I'm still not max cause I'm not rushing
Hey it’s a survival game but turn off all the survival settings! 😂
One tip I can give is if your having trouble or just want to be op quick catch a Hoocrates and 4 Daedream then make the Daedream coller so you can have all 5 of your pals out at once
did they patch out the ability to capture the thugs - since the update I havent been able to capture one
Didnt think this needed to be said, but with an exploratory game, its kind of fucked up to show all the cool end game shit, in the starting clips of your beginner tips and tricks. I understand you need all the help you can to retain people, being your personality sure as shit aint doing it. Still dont need to be "spoiled" of all the cool things that would be incredibly fun to find naturally.
I dont bother building a glider, I'd rather just catch a Celaray when starting out
I didn’t need a glider for such a long time as celaray is a glider also you have to tell everyone the controls not just Xbox players
Great video im loveing it so far and im solo only
Pressing dodge button is literally the point of dodging and it is better than glide-dodge
Keep inventory trick.     Over encmbe.  Die. Spawn at base near chests.  Unload
Pc player.     20hrs so far.   Zero crashes
Just subscribed best video on pal world keep up the good content!! Just help me sooo much!!!!
Been playing for hours per day since release and i haven't had any crashing issues unless im playing with friends
You can increase the number of Pals in your base to 20 in the settings.
Can have 20 pals in ur base just check ur worlds options kinda the last or before last point u can enhanced from 15 to 20 or even lower the amount c:
How do you make cloth? Lol can’t make a glider because it doesn’t tell you how to craft it
For the tip at 9:30 , I use the "sort by paldex number" option so I know exactly how many times I've caught a certain pal and what I need more of. Obviously this changes as I sell/enhance pals, like my Katress army that grows ever larger as the breeder progresses.  I try to keep at least 2 of each pal for breeding, then some for base management. Once I get better stats for some pals, I'll try breeding them into others.  I had a really good Bushi that I managed to breed the stats onto a few Anubis, and my ore mining base has never been better.  For gold, I don't use Mau because my Pals like to endlessly fabricate wood and stone from the earth without putting it anywhere. Instead, I just go down the hill and destroy the local wildlife and sell it to a merchant, along with the extra 5000 stone and wood.
your final tip is destroying the game experience, others are good.
18:38
Someone that tells me to immediately put the game on easy mode probably shouldn't be giving tips like he's a pro when the game is holding your hand.
10:30 you can change cap limit in server settings
Pro tip that everyone keeps forgetting: spend your stat points every time you level up. I think most videos of palworld players shows “unspent stat points” at the bottom on everyone’s screen. Don’t neglect or forget these!
'Gamepass' - yeah, that version of the game is a six month old build with a lot of problems...  The paid versions are stable though.
Thanks for reminding me about the shields. I am like 10 hours in and still havnet built a shield yet...oops
Has anyone had issues with the ground just not loading and just falling into the map? It's been happened so much to me and it's so frustrating when it happens on the lava island
My incubator is glitched and instantly incubates eggs, and I love it 💀
Played at least 10 hrs already and i have too say the ecubator is helpful for eggs and the vixy is Super helpful
Great video, just subbed can't wait to see what else you have to put out!
To add onto the mounted weapon combat tip, you can grapple hook off your mount as well. Especially helpful if you don’t have a flyer on you and you need a couple of extra inches onto your grapple.
Kid, you are just a liar. I've played hundreds of hours on my XBSX and it hasn't crashed a single time. Nothing. None of my friends have had any issues either.  It's extremely stable. You must be a Sony fanboy. Unbelievable. You're such a drama queen. If you have to change game options to make an already easy game even easier, then you should stick to Nintendo games kid. It takes maybe 30 seconds to get to a dead body. Oooh, so hard. Give me a break.
im much the same, i went 36  hours without making or catching anything either
man, i expected more tips and tricks, but you're just suggesting to play the game? I get you might have not did somethings when you first played, but before I left spawn I read and got all controls and paid attention to all the technology stuff, so all those things I did as soon as I can, got a shield, a saddle, a glider, but cmon majority aren't tips, just how you're supposed to play a game, is this a tutorial?
Another big tip for pals in your base if you get dreams collar it will stay out when in your party without throwing a sphere then you can pull out a separate pal and have 17 total work while you're there
Dude 28hrs without a shield😢😢😢
I used to believe that Western culture values honesty and discourages plagiarism. However, to my surprise, Palworld has gained such popularity, suggesting that plagiarism and deceit might be prevailing trends nowadays.
12 crashes?! Was it on a Series X? I haven't had a single issue, must be lucky.
“I know some of these may be obvious to you…”  Jokes on you, I’m an idiot, nothing is too obvious for me!
While this glitch will likely get patched out, you can refresh the timer on your food spoiling if you transfer all of that specific item back and forth between your inventory and a storage container. If transfering to an existing stack it just keeps the time remaining on that stack. It needs to be transfered to an empty slot.
lMAO get a pc and it wont crash.
Awesome video! Learned a bunch of new stuff. Btw, the base PAL limit can be increased to 20 through the world settings, before starting.
Beginning glider sucks,  can’t really glide with it unless you change stamina depletion rate and it’s only good for stopping fall damage really.
You mentioned locking on to pals? Is that really a thing? If so, I’ve been manually moving my camera around like a noob.
I dont get it, my pal cap is 15 but my friend joined my server and was able to use my palbox to put their pals in there and now its at 30.. on xbox
8:50 PAUSE 💀
You can increase the maximun amount of Pals in your base in the configs to 20
Does chillet respawn or can we find more?
I personnally just hit control in fights to... dodge things?... xD
You can have more than 15 pals on your base, you just need to increase the value in configurations just like you can for adjusting exp rate. The true cap is 20. And for my singleplayer friends that hate to wait over 1 hour for your eggs to hatch, you can change that soo you can hatch them instantly. A bit op, but for people that dont have that much spare time to play, it helps
Just a sidenote, the graphics on the PC are absolutely breathtaking Xbox when I tried to play I can tell it’s a lot of love but I’m glad they put it on Xbox. It means it will get worked out eventually.
you might as well play sandbox then
Damn. i already lv 47 in my world. But I don't even have shield.
You play with baby settings but if that’s what you like that’s cool. I play Xbox game pass on pc never crashed or had any issues.
PAL team is starving… how do you not see the warning???🤣
make sure to turn off structure decay so your base doesn't vanish before you
So start at level 30 is what im getting from this video.
Pal world huh just randomly came across this seem interesting enough what you need weapons for of ya got cha Pals though?
You can actually change the max number of pals on a base in the settings as well (Max is 20)
The pals put items in the chest beside the gather point is bullshit. Pure bullshit
One tip i learned is when your fighting a boss pull your pal back into the sphere so that you can avoid them taking damage from the boss then send them back out
Why is my ingot not duplicating but all the other resources are
Great tips bro. Keep killin it, SUBBED
For the egg hatchers out there, fireplaces of the same type dont stack heat, so 3 fires will only count as 1, but they will stack ifbyou have for example 1 fire, 1 heater and 1 electrical heater. Same for coolers
Check out Part 2 for even more Palworld Tips and Tricks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8Ey9kUS09U
i want to give some additional tips for catching merchants. There's 4 types of merchants based on the coat they wear. The things they sell do not change regardless of where your base is, their inventory is based on where that particular merchant spawned.  The red coat is a material merchant, he mostly sells crafting materials, and crops/seeds. These guys are good to have a source of something like leather or organs right in your base. High level saddles will need hundreds of leather and i found myself running out every time i wanted to saddle up a legendary pal. They buy anything from your inventory, though some items like keys and eggs are worth zero gold.  The green coat is a gear/ammo merchant, he sells a couple small pieces of gear as well as every type of ammo for guns. The gear is dependent on location of where you found him. so far i have only found one in the volcano's fishing village, and the desert settlement duneshelter. the fishing village guy, being by the volcano, sells fire/heat resistant gear for example. He will also buy anything from your inventory.  The blue coat sells pals. 5 randomly generated ones per day, with the options being based once again on where the merchant spawned. forest pals, volcano pals, desert pals, etc. This merchant will buy ANY pal from your party or box, but will not display the ones from your bases in the sell menu. And yes, ANY pal also means humans. The sell price is based on the rarity of the pal, the level, the passive skills, and whether the pal is alpha or shiny. rarity is kind of nebulous, but if you walk through an area and see packs of 3-6 lamballs, and one mammorest, the mammorest is the rare one. also pals that only appear through boss fights or breeding are extra rare.  the 4th type is the black marketeer, he is huge, scary looking and wears a black hooded cloak. he can be caught, but hes much more difficult than the rest as he uses a gatling gun, and summons his own pal to fight. he offers 5 random pals, seemingly these can be from anywhere, or at least any normal spawns, not sure if he can ever sell boss-only pals like jormuntide anubis jetdragon etc.
i only crashed twice in 35 hours on steam. idk if its because i wasnt multiplayer, or because the gamepass version is just that bad.
Use a heater for the scorhed eggs
pro tip for extra pals when you need more room beside the pal box, put them in a viewing cage, it's basically a pal box and I use it for when I want to fuse, one view cage holds 40 pals. so it is a good way to also organize as well! hope that helps!
dude plays on easy mode
This video is goated you doing gods work bro thank you
Does making a custom game stop you from getting achievements?
Base cap limit for pals is max 20, can be increased in world settings
You have server setting in tip but didint mention you can raise max pal count on your base to 20 from there 🤔
Nah, I completely disagree with turning the death penalty off. Having no risk at all makes this game VERY dull
xbox version is very different from PC version
One tip you could have mentioned with the Glider tip, is to get a Celaray around level 3-5. They are better than the Glider, and if you use the Condenser to improve their gliding ability…it becomes insanely good.
how 3 pal defeated by boss?
player 420.... xd well i mean its your first character so ....xd blaze it
max pals at base can be 20, in world settings scroll down to the bottom, you can increase it to 20 :)
10:41 I usually know which one my party’s does handiwork and whenever I need to craft I pop him out before hand
As well as selling pals for gold you can sell humans that you've captured.
I really hope nobody has said this yet, but if you go into the custom settings there is one at the very bottom that lets you change the max amount of pals working from 15 to 20! Having that extra five really helps with productivity
"Turn off the death penalty" nuh uh. We die like real men.
wow i am the guy 8 hours in the game not knowing why im dying thank u abt the shield … i thought it was for the base or something so i never got it
How in.. Ffs.. (>ლ) How did I never thought about capturing merchants. 😑 Definitely gonna try that slide and glide trick. For 15:13 electric types also works well. I love how the world settings actually *SAVES EVERY SETTINGS.* 😄👍🏻 Ark only saves a few settings. 😑
Surbs ev😂wbd she ❤
Dont be afraid to make your first base close to the waterfall of the windswept hills area its a good starter locale for pals and you can pretty much only get attacked from raids that have to come from the top of the mountain down and around the waterfall to your base. By that time you can have fires lit, walls slowing em down, and a few pals waiting when they do round the hill. Learned the hard way when a hungry oack of level 35 🦕  dinos came and wrecked my whole camp. Found out the path real quick and made sure it was covered lol. Mind you i was level 13. As were my pals and most of my worker pals. Owch.
I'm using your guide to get started on the game for the very first time tonight. ;)  Will let you know if I have questions
Oh also, I have a mouse with many buttons and for some reason the game can't map keys to it, so trying to time dodge on a keyboard is rather annoying. Can't double W tap dodge either. I do wonder if playing on a controller is actually recommended for combat, as it would make combat a lot easier.
Honestly the only tip I needed was just the placement of the first base. Had I known everything respawns I'd have planned very differently, had I known they auto harvest the respawning things I'd have placed it very differently. Where I placed has multiple bricks I can't remove because I put it near the first fast travel location.   Luckily the spot has so many rocks and trees that one expedition away means I come back to infinite of both, never needing either, as well as respawning berries. But running out of space fast. And raids are fun to deal with I will admit with the added obstacles but def prefer someplace flat.   If you can find an early spot that has berries, multiple different rocks and tree's early, would be much better. Could auto mine ore at the start of the game. If dismantling gave back everything you spent then sure it'd be easy to move.... but it doesn't appear to.
There is a setting to change the max amount of pals at your base range from 2 to 20 in the world settings.
for the scortch egg there is a heater.
Actually 15 is NOT the Cap of pets at the base, First in settings there are an option to turn up to 20 or down to under 15 if you wish, +1 Pal you carry. = 21 at base. which i'm on solo Play thru and not had lag or any problems with. ...  you mentioned the Mau cats getting gold, but Not that a Farm + VIXYs = Pal Spheres ... NOT a fan of the glitch cheats you point out ... But here is onebit of INFO I have tested ... the pets you can Glide with go farther than the Gliders,  a Galeclaw Glided abut 2/3 farther than my Mega Glider. ... Ive also tested Dont wast time adding Nimble, Runner or sprint to Glider pets, dones not make it glide faster or farther got all 3 on a galewind vs one with no skills landed same spot in testing
been on gamepads pc version and haven't had any problems.  also changing gexp and diff is kindle wack tbh. I'm enjoying a challenging version of the game Good tips either way man!
Here is how I Organize my Pal Box ... Page 1 is where Breed and captured pals land (It also hols my 2 Vender PALS I captured to sell with) ... Page 2&3 are for Pals I'm currently breeding skills with, 4th is Misc run over and Not desided yet ... 5th to 9th is Pairs of Pals a Mail and female (Low best with No Skills I can breed into them), 10th to 14th is the same Pals for Condensation, 15 are Boss Pals ive Tames and 16 is Bad breed Pals or bad skilled ones Ive captured ready to sell to vender.
You missed the tip that you increase the amount of Pals in your base from 15 to 20 by going to your servers world settings and increasing the number of max pals to 20.
The slide and roll 😂 I don’t use them 😅
I'm 90% certain that players on Xbox one can not do certain things in the game
How can i slide so fast?? 1:43 I normally run and press c but just slide a little bit
I also learned you can use that launch glitch on the enemies after sending the lv.31 pikachu looking boss into heaven after summoning mine right under it accidently.
I just use the final two pages as my main pal storage. This way everything else just fills in, but things I wanted favorited; I can find by just going back one or two pages.   Hoping I find a reason to start pumping the condenser before there is no room left.
Great video! You sound kind of like Owen Wilson and I love it!
I realized very early on that the pals you can use as gliders are multiple times better than the gliders you can craft. Not only in distance you can travel be also in the speed at which you move while gliding. I HIGHLY recommend using one of the glider pals, it makes it even easier to dodge in fights and traverse the map.
I climbed up the Pal sphere right as It captured and it sent me to space, lucky I had glider
GAAAH!!! THANK YOU!!  I've spent DAYS trying to get all my stuff from my death pile. Every time I get there, I die somewhere slightly worse. This area is 1000x too hard for a noob but thanks to this video, I was able to set myself to lose health infinitely slowly and man did it take me and four machine-gun equipped pals just to kill one gorilla.  First one I saw, mostly it's been teams of three queen bees buzzing around, and half a dozen armed humans...eek. THANK YOU! Back to standard 'normal difficulty' settings with ONE change - no drop on death cos never again!!
Havnt had one crash on Series S
What is the point of playing the game if you are going to turn off all penalties, duplicate all the items you need, and exploit the rest? I legit don't get it
Played around 30 hours already, did not had even one crash, maybe update drivers etc?
The grapple is buggy thou.
Are you really using over level 30 pals against the tutorial boss?😮
If you dont have any kind of death penalty then you really dont care if you die and you lose those cool moments when you manage to survive near death experiences.
Pro casual gamer tip: just turn the hunger all the way down to 0.1 and treat it more like an RPG pokemon 😅. This game has been a blast.
thank you Swany
Not buggy on pc at all really. I have experience 2 minor bugs that were fixed by exiting and entering in 14 hours
yoo what how do you lock on😂😂
Invaluable. I've got tons of hours already, but several parts of the video gave me perspective and I'll be honest... I was ignorant of the shield.. I thought it was a physical shield to hold lol
A few tips: You are not a true viking if you disable drop items on death --- so the tree in game will not get you to valhelm if you disable this on normal mode. (ok fine for multiplayer due to lag and dcs)  Now serios tips: There are bugs sometimes where you teleport to you base and your pal will be dead and game will ask you to get him to the box. DO NOT DO THAT!!!! Instead simply reset the pal by putting him into box and back and then push the body into a bed (but most of time they will just teleport themselfs and recover) A lot of people say, do not unlock anything else that you dont need for cake, but of they are so wrong. Getting salad will get your pals 30+ workpower when they eat it, speeding up base crafting by a ton. I would also recomend you take eggs, honey, milk, wheat and berrys out of their foodbowls and into a fridge. Instead replace their food with cooked versions as they will feed much better. Pancakes seems to be best so far (tho you need 2 wheat farms).  Now the important thing: Get flambelle as soon as possible (easy to get early in game in that hot area (366  - 33) as she will provide you with unlimted fire sacks (i have yet to see if ice and poision version to farm also exist). Other mats like arrows, money, palballs (crappy ones) can be easy farmed also (and better version of cloth later).  Try not to craft ammo, but just go to a vendor and buy it from them. Its much cheaper. (and be sure to mark every dungeon and skill tree on map via minimap) Same goes for other materials like bones, leather and oil. Its faster to just buy it then farm it yourself. Palfluid its probaly only anoying one.  Also --- sell the pals to vendors that have bad stats (no reason to upgrade your non-main pals with stats by sacraficing rare ones). Instead try to collect as many 2 gold skill ones so you can use them later to breed the stats you want. There is a full breeding guide just for that.
You HAVE to be on PC right? I am on Series X and I have had zero crashes. Not one of those peoples acting like "Oh I had no crashes so they dont happen" but if you are on Xbox and not console that is an insane disparity. The only problem I had was when I couldn't get back on one day.   And I even turned up the setting to have more pals spawn in the world.
You have to be some kind of fool for your pals in your party to starve. There is a literally a RED BLINKING prompt in the center of your screen that never goes away the minute your pals reach under 50% hunger.......
also if you want to down a high level pal fast you can drop a palbox down near the pal and have all your base pals fight them. Works well when you unlock 3 base and already use one for fast travel from anywhere reasons. 16 vs. 1 is pretty strong.
dude ive played hours... and still just learned a shit ton. good job fr. sub earned!
cat are a slow way to get gold jsut go hunt relaxasauras and sell them they go for like 2k each
Deffiently gonna crank the xp up i dont have alot of free time even though im sure I will spend it all on this
Need play it on steam. Xbox version is bad
he sounds like owen wilson
Dude I've played like 12 plus hours and didn't know you could slide
Another fantastic pet to Ranch is the Vixy. They provide Arrows, a little gold, and basic Pal Spheres. Super helpful in the early game, and even later when you want to do combinations, and need to catch dozens of the same Pal.  One thing you didn't address that I'd love to see, is now that I'm 30, the base raids spiked in difficulty, the raiders jumped from a handful of 10 to nearly a dozen lvl 30+ attackers with massive AoE. I can't even get a bead on one to shoot as they're running in before my shields knocked off and we're all dying in fireballs.
I got walls and gates around my base, pals keep going out and getting stuck, should I just remove the walls..?
Campfires don't stack, so only placing one is good enough
10 hours in I guess I’ll make a shield now
captured human can only use punches
Good video bro thanks!
Glitching not cool.
Wait it’s a shield not a shield you hold! 😮
Steam version has had ZERO crashes, i enjoyed it on gamepass so much i just decided to buy it :)
I refuse to change my game settings because im not a pussy bitch but the rest of the vid was really good
The Gamepass vesion was/is very buggy.  The Steam version does not have that issue at all.  The pal cap can be 20 if you change it in the settings.
NB> Camp fire doesnt stack. need 2 diferent sorces
Im lvl37 on default xp settings, I never got the glider since you get the flying mount fast. On pc max pal on base can be 20 but I leave as is on 15, I dont want to feel like cheating. I found out you can dodge when I was level 33 pressing it by mistake 😅
Da fffuuykk you can dodge
Wait that's what those green statues are for. I have collected so many of them 💀   also as a tip. Don't shoot to fire arrow at your wooden house. It will destroy everything and you'll have to pick up everything one by one
I play on Xbox and I’m glad to know I’m not the first to have nonstop crashes. I get around 30-40 per day + bugs where my pals just stop moving.  Any other game I would have quit but this game is so fun I’m willing to go through it😂 really hope they fix the crash issues soon tho!
Great video thanks 🎉
Grappling Hook tip is gold!
How can I turn exp sync off
They have area heaters in the game instead of campfires they work better
awesome vid! the dupe glitch works in reverse too, so build inside the base and step backwards so you can do generators or assembly lines for resources.
Why dont you go sale some of those extra pals? That pal merchant has some nice pals to buy every now n again as well
Im on Xbox and my game hasnt crashed once, no bugs either. Lucky i guess lol
You can change the settings to allow 20 pals in base iirc.
I didn’t bother making a shield because I thought it was for the base to keep enemies out and my base was so hard for them to get to
Great tips, Swany! It was hinted at, but it went over my head that you can cater to the needs of the eggs! This is vital tip for me, since I just came back to my mansion cabin home by the sea with a TON of eggs, but only managed to make 1 incubator so far, so I need all the help I can get!  Thank you kindly! Also, sliding is a thing? Plus, you can reset Dungeon Bosses? 🤩 Awesome! ✨
This guy sounds like Owen Wilson
Im level 31 and have yet to build a shield, for some reason i thought it was a shield around the base
Bro you sound like Owen Wilson and i think that's awesome! I can imagine one of the funniest guys in Hollywood giving me game tips and that's just next level stuff right there.
Im level 19 with no glider or shield yet haha.
Thanks so much
So I don't have to have the supplies on me to craft items, as long as they are in a box by my base?
The only thing i want added to the game is ability to key bind to side mouse buttons.  It would be so much easier to dodge if i could just click middle mouse button.  Great video btw.
Still waitin' for those beginner tips...
Don't make the same mistake? Got it, I won't buy Palworld. Thanks for the tip!
Surprisingly I haven’t found any bugs. Only crashed 2 times and it always always at launch
Thank you Owen Wilson 🙏🏻❤️
I would not recommend using a glider to dodge, use the designated doge button. It's faster
you never mentioned this tip for fast xp but if you use Jormuntide Ignis to cook berries you can get up to level 20 within like 20 minutes or so. he has level 4 kindlin.. use him and put all your other pals level one in your party and watch the xp roll in
one huge mistake i made today was going too close to the lava on a hill side and it made me catch fire and it was already too late. my bird died and i did too lol. it took me 3 times dying and buying heat armor over and over. good thing i farm berries and they sell for crazy money, 500 berries is 5k gold if you sell them
You can catch humans? Holy crap that's hilarious and edgy
I was exploring the volcano area in my last(first world, lvl 30). All rules were default, and I crashed mid flight and spawn in on lava under map died and lost all my items. So the no drop rule really would have helped me out if I knew back then
I have found and captured every pal so far. The harder ones came from huge eggs. Get a dragon and a saddle and you’re basically set to go egg hunting. You can reach anything with it.
do the effigies respond
You can actually increase max pals at your base to 20 in the world settings
How do you lock on?? i have over 30+ hrs and didnt know you could lock on to an enemy
10:25 You can actually increase it to 20pals at the base in world settings
I'm playing on the xbox gamepass version and my game only crashed on a server because my tucotuco unalived itself and continued to exploded to which my friend went and dragged its body and crashed the server
Bro this is the best pal world video ever! Thank you man
Good video didn’t know Owen Wilson was doing yt voice overs “wow”
There is a lantern to to help light up caves or at night. This will save you a pal slot and item weight/slot
Does duplication still work?
You probably shouldn't have included the duping bug, you're ensuring that all public servers are totally broken.
Me who already knew about the evasive roll: Wait, you can lock on to enemies!?
10/10 I'll try some of these tips today! Thanks!
Yooo my nigga omg!!  Broooooo! The death penalty!! Yess!! I hate dropping my loot  Edit: this video is the best
I know how you play the game is up to you. But hearing you talk about making the game easier for yourself makes me mad. Sorry I shouldn't say this, you should start thinking ethical when playing games.
Steam version better , + more frequent updates  they treat xbox gamepass version like a console version , so there is always gonna be update faster on steam , meaning players can not crossplay yet between steam and xbox gamepass , because the steam palworld runs on newer version and gamepass on older sad but true.
The 10 pal thing helps with the condenser staart got a 2 star dinobossom and 2 star foxsparx and their pretty darn strong also love the flamethrower harness 😂
You can increase the max Number of Pals in your Base to 20 in the settings before logging into your world
You can also keep an eye for sparkling pal, these pals have an extra skill, better stats and  a bit bigger than normal, you can spot them easy if they have sparkles around them, or they are bigger than normal.
Why is this game so fun.
PALWORLD 2024 Woohh
I think we built our base in nearly the exact same place
Looks like ark but with Pokémon 😂
Even if I have seen a Pal, it won't give the locations of them, till I catch them.
30 hours of playtime, just learnt bout shields, easily 100+ deaths
well here the problem you playing on game pass and it a older ver of the game and if you shelled out few buck you would not have as much crashs-bugs-ect
I bought the game last night and play like 30 minutes cuz I didn’t have time. But I can tell the game is amazing, I have to learn alot but I’m planning to spend the whole weekend on the game to learn everything that need to be learned. Thanks for this video, it was good to know that I can turn off the death penalty option
You called the dude over at 8:43, did something to his crotch and and he blushes and became very happy.....  🤣
Wow I am like level 28 already and did not realize I could build more bases
the duping don't work  no matter how much i try it
If you change game settings eg increase xp and turn off death penalty (drop gear upon death)  does it stop achievements unlocking?
How did your Pals starve to death?  There is a red banner popping up saying your Party is hungry. How can you miss that?
This game is so huge that a tips and tricks video for it is trending.
....I mean between changing the settings for more xp and duping resources.. why not just turn on god mode and set capture rates to 100% with any ball? Why not turn off stamina consumption too? Basically just skipping the game.
I went like 5 days before realizing there was a shield lol
How do you put out multiple pals during boss fight?
actually u can have 20 pals at camp not 15,u can change the limit in the setting but not while in a world.
I sure you hear this all the time, but it's sounds like Owen Wilson is giving the tip and tricks to me! ^_^ Whoaaa!
Man sounds like Owen Wilson with CRAAFT
i got a worahalic thug pal
long video short: use your brain and don't do stupid things... glad to save 20 minutes of your life.
Games like this are reduced to meaninglessness if there's no death penalty. That completely ruins the game. If there is no fear at all... there's literally no point to playing. You can do anything you want, there are zero consequences. I cannot for the life of me understand why people want to play this way, let alone recommend it to others...  Haha sure enough later in the video you admit to wanton abuse of this mechanic by using it to scout because you know there are absolutely no repercussions to dying. Wow, what a way to to absolutely ruin and destroy a great game.
Can your friends log into your server while you’re offline?
Yo thanks for this video man! I just started playing this game the night before, and so far it seems like there's SO MUCH in this game, but I'm trying my best to learn as much as I can and get into the groove of how everything works. So far I'm doing pretty decent but will definitely start doing the things within this video when I get the chance. 💯💯🔥
I thought the shield was like... a shield. And it's right next to the spear. And I just didn't want to play spear and shield. You're telling me. That it's a shield, not a shield. Mind. Blown.
Player 420 😎
dam  awesome fid man thanks
Bro i thought the shield would just be like a deployable and i did not think it was worth it 😅
Only one heat source is counte at a time, so if you place 5 campfires the game only counts 1 of them as heat.
I turned off the death penalty because I loaded in through the map in water some how and decided I don’t want to have to respawn and loose all my loot and then I just kept it off just in case 😁
Ark survival but Pokémon=good times
For the overweight thing I used to use the grappling gun in my base but now I drop half of the item then drop the other half and the transporter will pick them up. It's so much faster and I can keep collecting whatever.
probably lucky but i didnt crash playing day one release onto xbox gamepass, so. helps ive got a series x also if you're using a glider and you dont want to go down as much as forward, spam the glider button. the animation reset also resets the downward momentum and actually boosts you forward a little faster. if you time it right, you can also temprarily break the gravity by using the glider near a ledge  if you,re going along it and not jumping off. harder to replicate but definitely funny for movement
I thought the shield was for the base to be honest lol.
I don’t even play this game but I still watched this 🔥
I will say, I only have about 8 hours in the game and I'm level 32. I haven't even done the first boss tower yet. I just keep catching pals, literally every pal I see, up to 10, I catch. Sooooo much xp. I'll go explore and come back like three levels higher without realizing it (normal mode, no exp boost). I don't think it's a grind at all
.. Level 35 on normal XP rates.. All this time i thought the shield would be .. Something i hold in my hand... So i never made it... I feel so incredibly dumb, oh my lord.
Pal world is downloading so I taking notes I dont even take notes in school.
at first I thought the shield was a hand held item that went with the melee weapons so you could block but I was always using ranged weapons so never made one. I was lvl 23-24 before I finally made one
One thing I haven't seen anyone mention is the pals work way better as a glider. They go further and last longer. Celaray you can get at level 7 and is far better then the craft able glider and even better then the second glider you can make.
Wait.... You guys get fall damage? I've fallen quite a few times from some pretty big heights. Never had fall damage. And I'm playing on default settings. Glider is still handy though to cover aerial distances.
The only thing I’ll say. If your on one of the two easiest set of settings, getting the shield isn’t needed, I think I’ve only died 2 times in 30 hours
Turning off the death penalty feels like cheating
Your first tip was change world settings dude. There's an option in there to increase base pal limit 15 is the minimum
You said campfires will never make the scorching egg hot enough for it to hatch but in the video you made it hatch with 3 fires ? 🤔
Do you have a fix for dungeons on Xbox? When I play with my friend every time I go into a dungeon it kicks him and me from the game
I can’t people are supporting this company and their dodgy business practises. Unbelievable. Game could have made by the devil and if it was still fun no one would care.
my game has crashed 3 times in like 4 days so not bad
Thank you so much ❤
General Tips:  The game allows customization of server settings to adjust game experience. Adjusting XP rates and death penalties can significantly change gameplay. Gliders and shields are essential early game items for navigation and combat. Using the dodge and roll mechanics effectively enhances combat survivability. Fast travel points are crucial for efficient navigation due to the game's large map. About Pals and Combat:  Leveling up Pals and the character increases your catching skill, essential for late-game content. Organize Pals in the PO box based on their types and functions for better management. Capturing humans in the game is possible and they can serve various roles like guarding or trading. Gaining XP bonuses for capturing multiple of the same Pal can expedite leveling. Resource Management and Base Building:  Strategically placing storage boxes at resource collection points streamlines resource gathering. Crafting food pouches is vital to prevent Pals from starving. Different Pals spawn at different times (day or night), information available in the pal deck. Using momentum with the glider can aid in faster map traversal. Advanced Gameplay Tips:  XP is shared among all Pals in the party, allowing for efficient leveling of new Pals. Using certain Pals for their light in dark environments like caves. The grapple hook can be used for movement when over-encumbered. Weapons can be aimed while mounted on Pals, combining their abilities with weapon support. Dungeons offer opportunities for resource farming and encountering stronger Pals. Special Tips and Glitches:  Certain locations are recommended for base building due to resource availability. Cat-like Pals can be used to accumulate gold efficiently. A skydive glitch can be used for quick elevation gain. A resource duplication glitch exists at the edge of the base's radius.
I never use shields I'm a dual weapon kinda person so I never use shields in any game...... Thank you so much for that advice 😅
You can increase the base pal cap to 20 in the settings, I believe.
You can change the pal cap from 15 to 20 ;) in your custom settings
how do I make my pals put stuff in boxes I have a box between my stone quarry and tree plot my pills don't put it in the Box they just leave it in the station
loved the video but shining light on bugs meh the ball one is okay but dupe glitching is always lame
Idk why but i heard owen wilson narratating this whole video
Me "Gotta catch them all!" Other people "But you're catching humans!" Me "Did I stutter."
Loving the game, im playing default, no glitches or exploits or setting changes
I think they patched the duping
I'm like 3 days in, so these tips are pretty much useless to me, but I wanted to say that I've never liked Pokémon, never liked the idea of it or anything remotely to do with Pokémon...until Palworld... This game has me hooked, I can't remember the last time I was hooked on a game, this game is so simple, yet so amazing. A game being this good in early access is a really good sign, but I just hope the Devs don't take advantage of it's popularity and decide to throw in pals that you need to buy to obtain etc... i will honestly rate this a solid 10/10 game. Survival/crafting game mixed with little (and big) monsters you call pals :D.
Playing this with the boys is probably the most fun I’ve had in gaming in a very long time
sucks that the game pass version is so bad, Group of friends has not had a single crash on PC wouldn't say it had a "rough launch" it had a record breaking one.
“Pull out your pal and you ride them” 😭😭🙏🏼🙏🏼
I keep seeing in videos that power effegy being learned from the skill tree but mine doesn't have that. Where do you get it?
As an Xbox series x player I can say without a doubt I have issues falling through the map sometimes it's got awful last night I couldn't get back up but I'm falling through the map and that's my only issue sometimes trying to get my loot back because I feel through the map of the pain in the ass but
Lock onto your target? Im assuming this is console only?
you can just craft a lantern for light, so its kinda rediculous to lite the room by a fire pal. You only need 1 foodbagslot, the bigger bags are totally useless, dunno why you are promoting them and show inventories with only baked berries, which only cost 1 slot. Get urself a flyer just asap as the slider weights 15kg and you really dont want to use points on extra weight so who cares about the slider as its way to heavy.
how to slide on the ground like that?
Wait how are you playing with friends on  the Xbox version ? Mine says it doesn’t support multiplayer yet
OmG boss farmingggg 18:30
14ish hours in still no shield lol since the first one sits next to the spear in the technology tab I though it was like a physical shield you carry
1:37 your games been struggling? I've got been playing pretty consistently aince release on xbox series x and havent had any issues running the game aside from a single frame drop that lasted like 5 seconds passing by the sword portal. Am I just lucky or is he just getting some bad luck?
I played for a few hours yesterday and only ONE crash. I feel lucky
You had me until the end. Using dupes in a game like this is lame AF, especially since the Journey is why the game is fun. There should no rush at all to get materials.
You said there’s a lock on. How? (Xbox)
OMG the Merchants one saving lives out hereeeee 😢😢😢
This game is so addictive, when I first got it within the first 5 hrs I decided to use PTO for the next day and then proceeded to play it for a little over 28 hrs straight 💀
I hope the woke ppl don’t try and cancel this game lol😂
Lot's of good info here. Thanks man!
This game had a bad launch!? Its a fucking beta dude it hasn't even been "launched".. it litterslly says "preview" in the title.
So this game is if Ark and Pokemon had a baby.  I get it now.
lol POKEMAN!! That’s hilarious
berry farms at each base is the best way to make cash. currently have 3 bases and each base has 4 berry farms and over time you just go and collect then leak 200 berries and sell the rest
Huge tip for getting rich quick, just sale nails. Have a mining base that  also produces nails. They sell for way too much. Have a merchant in your base because you want to have so many nails it becomes impossible to move, you will make millions passively.
I caught a boss recently and their op asf😂
10:40 in custom settings you can incerss cap to 20
How do you put down multiple pals at once? Or is that just for fights against the 5 tower trainers?
For the respawning part, you dont have to die. You can just hit esc and click respawn so you dont have to go out and get yourself killed lol obvi turn off death penalties so you dont drop everything
Um, you don't need ancient tech to make the statue of power. It requires neither ancient tech points nor ancient civilization parts.
Player 420 😎
Using your own weapons on your mount only works on certain mounts I believe. The ones that you "hug" to ride, you don't have that option unfortunately. Prevents me from riding around on my Dinossom blasting pals and npcs :(
W
i absolutely love this game lmao
You can get 20 pals at your base. Just use the slider bar to increase it. Slider is where you adjust world options.
I've played for about 7 hours so far and the only thing I can say is "ITS LIKE IF MINECRAFT WAS GOOD!"
You can also adjust the stamina of your pals in the world settings. You can fly higher longer
I have like 22k gold and have never seen the wandering trader exce0t when he first spawn in the 1st hour of my playthrough. Is the trader town the only other place where there are wandering merchants?
The bugs and crashes seem exclusive to xbox cuz ive been on steam and zero issues so far.
A glitch I haven't seen anyone mention yet: If you have food that is about to go bad, you can place it in any storage, then put it back in your inventory and the decay timer will reset. This only works with the hotkey to place the entire stack, and not if you just drag it across.
Just so you know the game pass version is very different to the steam version which is more refined. For example the egg incubator requires ancient tech points to unlock in the steam version.
Instead of killing yourself without the death penalty, you can just go to respawn in the settings
It's better on steam
cant make any mistakes when it crashes every 15mins
I play on Series S, solo, and I find that instead of crashes I get this bug where the game gets stuck saving and every 10-30 seconds I get a message box that says it can't save. Anyone else having this problem?   Instead of a glider, that takes up 10+ lbs of weight, I recommend using a gliding pal. The Galeclaw (I think that's the name) is way better and faster than atleast the first and second made gliders.
You can change the setting so that you can have up to 20 pals working in your base. You change it at the same place as all the other world settings. Very surprised that was missed, most important setting for myself.
Sounds like u play on easy mode. PC master race
My name’s SWANNY also!
If you slide into a jump glide you go miles faster. Just use a downhill slope slide jump glide. Be zoomin like the flash!
Also for catching humans you can get them the ability fruit as well and they can use moves like the pals
15:15 what did bro say? All I heard was “hold n the b button”
Breath of the Wild meets Pokemon?
The limit of 15 Pals in your base can be changed in world settings, so you can have more.
The crashes only seem to be on the game pass version, my two friends on it crash occasionally but me and the other five friends on steam have never crashed. Just an FYI
U can use vixy wich farms u money spheres and arrows
Owen wilson jr?
Is the max pals at base max 15 for xbox game pass version?  I cant flint the option to increase. (Theres no option for me)
Selling baked berries will net you a good amount of gold. A kindling pal with artisan will crank through them, and its some passive exp. They're 10 gold each so 2k berries is 20k gold Nice thing to have going in the background
the last tip is the best ! thank you ! although it kindda illegal XD
Here's a good tip not many people think of.    Use your spare palboxes as a weapon.  When you want to fight an open world boss.  You can place a palbox nearby the boss, Pull out as many pals as you can.  And when you engage that boss.  The pals that are roaming the area around the box will then engage that world boss with you.  You can also use a palbox as a portable quick travel.  So what you do is carry one with you. (Have the materials needed to place it down) Place the palboxes at the ores or coal or sulphur you'll be mining, so that even if extreemly overweight, you can just quick travel to your base. And then toss the heavy ore onto the ground and your pals will put it into boxes for you while you go back and mine more.  You can strip an entire heavy ore area doing this without needing a bunch of traveling.
I could literally play this shit all day
7:10 does anyone actually know if leveling up power capture works or not? I feel like it’s bugged? I got it up to level 6 but see no difference in capturing percentage? Thanks in advance!
What stats advice to raise? Thanks.
Why would anyone want tips on a game that just came out. It's literally like having someone else play the game for you. I'd be burnt out soo quick on this game if there was nothing to figure out by myself lol.
I play  on Xbox as well. Have 1 day 12 hrs played and no crashes. Maybe it's the multi-player aspect  causing it. Dunno but single player I dint have any crashes
Got a pokemon add before the vid. They wish they had made this already im sure
haven't watched the vid entirely yet but 1 tip i have not seen yet, in all tips vids when you get to your first fast travel point, build a chest (not really needed tho) throw your stuff in it, jump in the sea or fight a pal and die select a fast travel point not the one you just opened die, rinse and repeat till you have them all and just travel back to the first one and viola
Removing the death penalty is removing an entire third of the SURVIVAL game. I'd never put that in a tips video, tbh.
This game is literally Breath of the wild meets ark meets Pokémon
I’ve had not 1 crash on Xbox and as far as dying rare as rocking horse shit for me what are you a troll
Ngl this didn't help lol
Max pals in base can be changed to 20 in settings.
How do you mount the animal. I crafted the saddle I just can’t figure out how to apply it?
I feel like i am already falling behind, i spent 3 hrs building the tallest tower to see how high i can go before the game says now more just to watch it burn down in minutes😂
A mistake i made was getting a bunch of digtoises for mining a specific ore, any other lvl 2 or 3 mining pal is better than digtoise... this is because digtoise simply doesnt deal enough damage to ores
Haven't watched you since the days when cookie played with you on bf2...    Playing on the game as easy as possible and calling it tips is kinda wild bro.
That duplication glitch is a fuckin life changer bro.  Is it wrong to abuse it? Absolutely.  Will I abuse it before the devs patch it? More than any alcoholic stepfather could ever dream.
Played it for about 15hours, not a single crash. On Steam.
Don't do the mistake and keep playing in Vanilla. If you spawn with all your loot after dieing, where is the Challenge?
I don't "want to" I "Gotta catch them all" BIG difference lawl
My friend abandon tarkov wipe to play palworld
HUGE TIP There was an mammoth near my camp, it always walked through my early base. So I threw down bout 10 campfires across his trajectory. And it worked!! The mammoth walked through and cought fire. I just waited till he was nearly dead and caught him without attacking him.  It also helps when you camp gets attacked,wall your camp with a single narrow entrance, stack campfires in front of that entrance. When you get attacked enemies will catch fire and die..  Edit:when using Deadeams necklace you can stack Deadreams up to 5. 5 palls fighting with you. When leveled they do huge damage.
How exactly do you lock on?  Is it possible with the keyboard?
Best tip in boss battles watch your boss, and make sure to get your pal to take aggro everytime the boss uses there main damage attack on your pal call your pal back then throw them elswhere away from the attack rince repeat easy boss kill.   Also fly around at nyt you see everything glowing ie fast travel areas, effigys etc honestly rhe best way to farm all your chest etc
Useless video. Bro just trying to get on that algorithm
My incubation is bugged so my eggs finish instantly. Honestly, it's a godsend for breeding.
I'm on series S and I have not had a single crash
You missed the most important starter tip, when mining and you keep running out of space, make all your pals the starter cat thing, each one in your party give you extra carrying capacity
I love how the fire creature aluminate dark caves. "When you summon it."  I think this game is "Objectively IS."  Blatantly ripping off multiple other games and to an extent I am okay with that. What they and anybody else creating anything NEEDS to do, is make a unique UI, Flora, Fana, ecosystem, history, politics and ect. When I look at this game it IS NOT new and or creative. IT IS a cookie cutter COPY of MULTIBLE other games. Which to an EXTENT "I think." is okay. Again while watching this game it has many great qualities/features of other games, which definitely makes it a 10/10 FUN game. What I want though is for it to LOOK like its own game and not like anybody else's... WOOT WOOT games are fun, THANK you for making this video.
You missed that you can actually catch tower boss with any ball if you agro them first with guards. Kinda tricky to do, but I already got 3
Sorry but the tip to cheat the game by turning off death penalty is dumb…. Normal mode which is intended for normal playing (self explanatory right) has it on and you lose inventory items. Maybe next time you’re doing these videos think about the wider spectrum and people do play on hard because if not on hard this game is just too easy
4:08 there's no lock on mechanic button in this game. Do you just keep your crosshair on the enemy as a pseudo lock on?
Highly recommend playing this on pc. Hearing the console problems, idk how y’all can do this to yourselves
I haven’t crashed at all on game pass but that’s me
Didnt crash a single time lol
I feel like I non stop grind for hours and am only level 15
So make those mistakes as it's a open world game and you can't stop me.   Gotcha!
Does changing the settings stop you from getting achievements?
This is the firat game in awhile i actually ENJOY playing its crazyy and i absolutely love it and hope theres a series or alot of add on's different maps ext.
Play on pc rn but hope it comes to ps5 cause I LOVE IT
YO GREAT TIP HERE MAKE SURR TO CATCH EVERY BOSS BECAUSE SOME OF THEN REQURE YOU TO GO TO T O H (not a fun place to be)
That’s crazy how much yours crashes, I’ve had maybe one(pc) Baldur’s gate has been having problems with Xbox as well
The crashing is mostly an xbox issue. it is early access so hopefully it'll get fixed for you. it runs perfectly fine on PC (steam)
there’s no way this isn’t Owen Wilson voice …. Jokes 😂 all love my dood. I appreciate the tips!🙏🏼
I love Owen Wilson’s tips and tricks vids
I start a new game because update was in and I did this because the tech path was heavily changes. I think the earlier build Xbox platform are much easier requirement that probably the advice receives kinda differ a bit.
Wdym with the eggs thing? Ive hatched a fire egg just fine in my base. Didnt need campfires or anything like that.
Awesome game 🎮!!
Damn, I wish you the best on crashing. Been on since 18th and can't remember more than 3 or 4 at most. ❤💯
.......uhh I should have made the shield like 10 hours ago.
im level 25 and just learned i can slide, thank you lol i thought the glider was trash other than saving from fall damage
I hav3 had zero crashes and no bugs. On Xbox and 50 hours in.
This ninja just said u can have you kn what for the npc humans awe helll nahh 😂😂😂😂 .....say less lmaooo insert evil laugh
wait you can catch syndicate members?
One tip i have is what ground mount to use.  The game says the direhowl is fastest but it's wrong. The direhowl is fastest if you're only sprinting, however the Eikthyrdeer has a move called antler uppercut thats a fast long dash, when you use the uppercut for mobility it makes the deer way faster than the wolf is.   Also the bonus experience from catching 10 of the same pal scales with your level so no matter what level you are its always the best way to level up
Thank you for the tips!!
OMG! Lmao my daughter looked up while you were kneeled and petting your human! She was like "OMG mom what kind of game IS THIS!" 🤣
Thankfully i am playing on Steam, i didnt have one crash so far.
Bruh I didn't even know you could slide
A better tip for hatching eggs is to put the setting on 0 and there done instantly
You saved my life with the ore/coal location thank you
dupe glitch doesnt work on pc
One of my tips for mobility, carry 2 or more grapple hooks
Bro it actually crazy how good it is
I play on xbox and i cant even go in caves without crashing it happens every time 😢
I played on the gamepass version too at the beginning. And today I bought the steam version and omg. The game runs moch smoother and better on the steam version.
omg I'm glad I watched this. I didn't realize THAT is what the shield was like 🤣😅🤣
Thanks for the knowledge my dude
Wait.. There was a shield? Damn, no wonder it has felt so goddamn hard lately. I'm currently at lvl 35.. I thought it was some base related shield like some ARK Tek crap. Jeez..
Only one heat source is counte at a time, so if you place 5 campfires the game only counts 1 of them as heat.
this game is addicting.
Played at least 30 hours already, tons of gaming experience, learned two MASSIVE new things in just the first 10 minutes, great video
PalWorld has never crashed on my Xbox series x
Its Ark Zelda and Pokemon combined
Im a game pass player. I crashed in the middle of boss battles
You the real hero here good sir! Thank you for your supportive contribution!!!💪🤓
AS AN XBOX SERIES X CONSOLE OWNER, I ❤❤❤ THIS GAME!! I "CANT" STOP PLAYING!!!
First
