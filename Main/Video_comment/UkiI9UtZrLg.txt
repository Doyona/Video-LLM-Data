Elton sings from his heart.
Love you Elton... Thank you for the outstanding music that has touched my heart for decades.
У, Элтона Джона, самые позитивные песни!

Beautiful !
Guess what??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
A tribute to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II... Rest In Peace your Majesty...
I would say thank you, but it would be insulting given who Elton John is. We could always count on you for the big moments.  I'll say it anyway, thank you.

Unfortunately the queen has passed away today, but she will be eternal in our hearts. Our best wishes and may be with her Phillip in the eternity.
Looks like Diana is in spirit sitting behind him
Elton is one of those fabulous ‘evergreen’ musicians who goes on and on - always special to have a classically trained pianist to go with the pop element , a magical musical recipe, fab xx
❤🇧🇷
A national treasure playing in a palace!
Elton means England..
one of UK's hero
I can’t listen to this song and not cry. It touches the deepest feelings of my soul. Masterpiece. Bravo, bravo Elton.
Legend!!!

WONDERFUL 👋👋👋👋👋💖❣️
EJ still has it. Sounds Great!!
Posso viver outras vidas..Mas JAMAIS esquecerei desta obra prima! Música pra varias reencarnações!!!!
It’s a truly lovely song. From 1970. I wonder if musicians succumb to the distractions of technology and devices like everybody else such that they don’t come out with LOVELY songs like this today.
Wonderful
Elton John é o maior exemplo de artista que melhora com o tempo.
J adore ce chanteur merveilleux 😍😍très belles chansons
Put down a lot of korean and world's stock. And d'ont raise it up. This is right in Jesus Christ~!  🐢.......

Beautiful song !
.....and looking great too   his voice got this nice vibrato that older people have. I still love you Sir Elton John   I got some of that vibrato too ( smile)
A music genius, Sir Elton John.
He's a wonderful singer. His songs speak to my heart. God bless you Mr. Elton hugs❤🙏❤
This song and performance would bring a tear to a glass eye. What a legend.
💚❤️🇵🇹👍🏻🇬🇧
The best! Song of my childhood. Love it!
Love you!!! Don't stop singing!!!!
This was a bit of a cop out...he was advertised as being one of the acts of the night...not a video of him projected onto the building. Don't get where he was that could be more important than an invite here.
LOVE
Beautiful 💕💕🌹🌹
What an excellent and fitting tribute to the Queen! Fantastic version. Really touched listening to this. It should be one of the greatest love songs ever written.
The song is not a masterpiece,     He himself is a masterpiece👑
Te amo Elton pero más Dios...❤...excelente performance...
Lovely.
Great!!
Dos 13 aos 62 anos sua musica permea sempre com estrelas a minha vida e  os meus sonhos ! Gratidão por você existir para todos nossos corações💝❤💫
Tawdry, cliched song lifted out of the doldrums by Elton’s piano playing and, above all, that extraordinarily authoritative voice, still commanding our attention after all these years
🎼💃🎼
O senhor e o piano, ambos tornam-se um; magia que irei levar no coração para sempre!! Te amo!!
Pai amor para sempre!
He's a wonderful pianist, who emotionally plays the piano to move us to ecstasy. The lyrics, the emotional voice, combined with an angelic feeling, that's amazing!🌹❤️
L e g e n d a r y......Your music will move generations to come!
So beautiful. Sir Elton is a master.
So beautiful. Sir Elton is a master.
Parabéns!! Amei!!🥰🥰🥰❤❤🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷👏👏👏
A Great man and Life President of Watford Football Club.  We are so, so proud of this man from Pinner - God bless you 🙏
my dear Elton John, you are part of my story. Good health and peace to you and your family.
The Legend
I love his music, well done Sir 👍🏻
wow what a story teller.
Cant  stand  this  Old Queen.  I beleive  he's  behind  a  lot oif  stuff  the  Sussex's  do  against  the  British  Monarchy
From Diana funeral to Queens Jubilee...
Artists don't come better than this. What a true legend.
This man is still as great as ever, what a great voice!
Where was Tom Jones singing green green grass of home!
it's that old pub singer again
Thought he was writing a new song???
Stunningly beautiful song. Lyrics and piano both.
Been on the mall. Listening to Elton was special    I watched people’s faces some cried  others smiling but listening. Thanks Elton and I thought of Diana ♥️
Mr. Elton John I 💖you!!!💋💋💋
Temonnn...Elton sin dudas el mejor.
Wow completely haunting me out with the castley stuff, is Diana there??? Beautiful, simply beautiful.
Brilliant performance and excellent sound engineering
Sir Elton John, por siempre, magnífico.🌟
Maravilhoso!
❤️
What a Legend!!! Timeless.....one of the greatest of all time....Love from Canada.
A certified hood classic
Eccezionale Elton John Bravissimo. La seguo dagli anni '70 ed è  sempre un'emozione ascoltarla. Grazie di esistere. 🙏👏👏👏👏👏🌹❤
Sir Elton John! Amazing!
My favourite performance from the party. This is music!
It's a great song, isn't it!  It's always been a classic.  I think Mr John would have sat well at a table with Puccini or indeed understood the Joke of Knots in the work of Mozart in 'Le Nozze di Figaro'.  Both incredibly gifted in their appreciation of the knot Joke because it really isn't a joke for a lot of people, is it Elton;)  Here's my revision of, 'Telling Stories' by Tracey Chapman.  I call it 'Rhyme Space'.  It's public domain and free to share:)  Have a look at it.  Build on it, change it, erase it  et cetera.,  I'll take a look one day in the future and see if it's been transformed and improved on.  I don't think it would be hard to improve once the gist is understood.  Here's link.  Cheers:)  https://youtu.be/iWK1J7zoBfM
And thank you Bernie Taupin.
Absolutely fantastic!
The queen could live for another 20 years We look forward to your 80th jubileu
Beautifully sung. ❤
Elton John, a brilliant pianist, and singer!
His voice  is still as strong as ever
The power of a Piano!!!! What a song ... Elton´s the best!!! Happy Jubilee to the Queen ... greetings from Germany!
très beau jubilé 'formidable les trois petits de Catherine et William les parents aussi , Catherine  , très jolie , la reine    très digne .
elton john just sing for the queen
elton du gehst mit auf den sack
He sang beautifully at Dianas funeral
Amo esta canción ❤️😍
I listened to  Elton John as a kids and I am almost 60 now . I can not believe I still watching him perform .   What a great musician he is .
THE BEST!!!!!
Sensacional !! - náo há outras palavras.....Theres no other words to tell how gold this is...chees Rio / Brazil
This song is a jewel …Love every note,every word!
Elton is a living legend. 💗
There are no words to describe the absolute unstoppable beauty of this mans work. The new generation of musicians should just stop..put down their blunt little tools.. and learn from this beautiful craftsmanship. ♥️
Lovely . Love from the Philippines .
The wonderful ♥️ words of Bernie Taupin . The other half of Elton John .
Tears in my eyes and in my heart. Elton, you will be forever in my heart.
Owh my god... This song is one of my late father's favourite...
When you consider his lifestyle, the line “I don’t have much money” will always put a smile on my face.
Love him so much “ Your Song “ beautiful !
Love Elton John he's strong hearted I wish princess diana could of been there with her son's and grandchildren it would of been beautiful to see I'm sure diana is there in spirit miss you so much with all my heart 😳😔💞❤⚘🦋🌸⚘🌸⚘🌻⚘🌻⚘
Diana Ross you were fantastic.  Watching from Malaysia.
His vocals are holding up really well.👍👍👍👍
mr Elton legend!!!!
Thank you.
Sir Elton John is one of the most well known artists in the British musical industry and there's not many living legends left in the UK..
Elton John 💖🌎🔥
I grew up listening to Elton John thanks to my elder sibling whose musical taste influenced me!  Eltons' music is timeless & has helped me through even the toughest of times.   Thank you so much Elton (AKA Reginald Dwight)   Thank you for the music
RAW! BEAUTIFUL! As only Sir Elton John can do.  You have been the music of my life. Thank you Sir for this heartfelt tribute!
Great version, he sounds great! looking forward to seeing him live for the first time in Bristol soon
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyX0twnnyHA&t=1s
The Best....
Fantastic
Nice job Elton.
I have just realized that I miss his songs. I need to listen to Elton again
Class act. Thank you Elton John for your gift.
This song always makes me cry...I love so much Great-Britain and for always ❤🇬🇧❤🇬🇧 So sad Harry is not with his beloved grandmother, just by her side...How wonderful life is while you’re in the world❤
Bela voz! Roupa discreta!
Que hermoso tema <3 Elton  <3 <3
I even think Elton John is a great singer but after he spoke ill of the world star Elvis Presley I stopped liking it, I realized that Elton John is a clueless guy.
Princess Diana would have been smiling down on him xx she loved his music
A música é maravilhosa, a voz estupenda! Tenho pena de não perceber bem a letra If someone can translate for me, I would be very grateful Obrigada
It's my most favourite song of Sir Elton. I love when he changed the lyric from guy to thy. God bless her majesty the Queen.
My Mum said-he is the best singer under the sun! He is it really. 🌞
Please check your geographical settings and make this available to view in the U.S.   Apparently it says "not available" for U.S. viewers.   I'm in Canada and am able to see it.
❤❤❤
Yes I agree he is a Legend.
Elton had to be there - of course ! I just remember him performing „Candle In The Wind“ at Lady Diana‘s funeral; not a joyous occasion, the funeral, but it seems there is an Elton John song for every occasion
You don't have much money but they sure do
SIR ELTON, U R TRUELY THE GREATEST THAT'S WHY U WERE CHOSEN TO BE HERE FOR DEAR DIANA & NOW TO SING FOR OUR QUEEN ELIZABETH.WE THANK YOU.🎼
Ich möchte nächste Jahr dein Konzert  besichtigen.
Elton John Freddy Mercury due leggende  due talenti unici e irripetibili ..quando si nasce con dono  e quel dono riesci a farlo crescere .grazie per le vostre emozioni
BRAVOOOOOO SIR JOHN 💖💖🙏🙏🤩🤩
I've loved Elton since I saw him at the Nashville Rooms (North End Road, W14 next door to West Kensington Station) back in the late 60s when he was still called Reg. Seen him so many times. Got to be honest and say that half the time here he sounded Scottish.
Yes this could have played non stop whilst I worked in that casino. Well named doncha think? The Sportsman. Now about the menu - chef. Hen mute? I thought so.
Best singer as usual. Thank you, Sir Elton John.
💟🤘🏻
He's got to be the best performer ever.  just brilliant.
It's the best of the best hear Sir Elton John singing! Greetings from Mexico!
Dios su voz suena mejor que en los últimos 10 años! No puedo creerlo
Why did he not perform live? He was in the UK right? Could it be that he hasn't forgotten how certain members if that family treated his friend Diana?
Excelent artist
What this video doesn't show is the lyrics being projected live onto the front of Buckingham Palace during the concert.   On the main BBC broadcast, as Elton performed "Your Song" (which incidentally happens to be one of my all time favourite tunes), it was HORRIFYING to see a few spelling mistakes being displayed in the backdrop.  "Now YOUR in the world... "  And...  "But now that ITS done".  It's both EMBARRASSING and SHAMEFUL that the BBC could broadcast the #PlatinumJubileeConcert across the world without knowing the difference between "you're" / "your" or when the word "it's" requires an apostrophe!  Don't get me wrong, it's not normally something over which I'd get this annoyed. Mistakes such as these are quite common to see in YouTube comments or on Twitter... And that's totally fine.   But the BBC!??? During the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations?!!!   Also, the "Queen's English" is supposedly revered across all of the Commonwealth nations which makes it even more embarrassing that these typos were projected in huge letters onto the walls of Buckingham Palace.  Standards should matter, particularly when it comes to events such as these.   I tweeted screenshots on my Twitter account if you need proof.   Anyway... Rant over!   The concert was great, by the way!
I would have thought he'd come up with a new song for this special Jubilee Celebration.  Disappointed....
Better than the original in my opinion. deeper. The subtle note changes are perfect.
If He couldn`t to be alive ,another artist or band should be invited cause there are so many legend in british music still alive  to be invited.
my all time fav elton john song
Godh I love his performance always so beautiful!
2:41 "you're not the sweetest dice I've ever seen" 🎲😂 automatic subtitles are so funny sometimes
I can’t say much more other than, the crown has brought so much stability, honour and pride to this great country and HM and her family have given so much more than they ever receive. I am glad and honoured to stay I am proud to be English and have such a great monarchy serving. People should be ashamed to request removal of the monarchy. It’s the monarchy that’s paved the way for this great country and it’s amazing history. I can only say one more thing, long live the Queen and God save the Queen. Charles and William are by your side as are we Ma’am. Happy and Glorious 🇬🇧 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
As great as the unfirgettable Candel....and as appropiate  Great man and musician
WHO IS THIS MAN ? JOHN ? I ´VE NEVER HEARD FROM HIM BEVOR !
His best song ever.
As if he sang it for the first time...full of conviction and with a lot of love for the song...I am very overwhelmed by this performance!
Marvelous Elton John.
Magnifique !
This is one of the best songs of all time and it was Elton John's breakthrough into stardom.  Elton is an extraordinary talent combining both orchestral and popular music into timeless treasures. This song was my wedding song and it takes me back to that very special day whenever I listen to it !!!
Not every music is a song. Not every song is a music. Sir Elton John, thank you.
he made this song to Diana, yes?
💜💜💜💜💜
A family of nonces... Disgusting
he was thinking of Diana, there's no way he's genuinely singing for the Queen. I said what I said😬
Lindíssimo !!!
Elton John and David Bowie are gifts straight from God.
probably the best of Elton & Dick Turpin's collaborations...
SZUPER
a timeless piece of music 🇬🇧
This song ❤

I swear everytime I hear Elton sing I have goosebumps run down my back ❤️such an amazing voice and talented wow
It is time to get right with Jesus. You aren’t going to automatically enter into heaven if you have lied or stolen or had premarital sex. Even one of those makes you worthy of hell fire.  Don’t deceive yourself! The punishment of sin is hell fire.  Jesus died so you can get a clean slate and forgiveness of a future sin when we confess it. When you start to follow him you have to strive to obey what he commands.  No one will enter heaven without the blood of Jesus. No other way but through Jesus.!!!
💞💞💞
magical voice and song.
I am not crying, you're crying.
What a legend , but sadly even the legends find it difficult to draw the curtain on their majestic careers.Rod , Paul ,Elton we have absolutely loved you.Bow out gracefully and don’t tarnish the wonderful memories
🤢🧨
"How wonderful life is while you're in the world."
Love this song
Not got much money? 🤔 🤣
Ditch the wig mate, looks stupid
🙏🤗
Some niggas in America like him.
im sure charles & camilla left their seats when he sang the song in tribute to diana.
As always Beautiful ❤👍
Like always amazing sir Elton John
Con la emoción de siempre,al escuchar a este ídolo,aplaudo de pie...Se escuchan mis aplausos,desde tan lejos??? Desde Argentina,beautiful people...
the gold piano lol
Yes...how wonderful life is if Princess Diana was still in the world. This song reminds me of her. How beautiful she was. You can feel her being so genuine. So, please! Don't compare her to Camilla nor to her Kate and Meg. There is only one Princess Diana and no matter how they are projecting Kate's image...Diana would still be the greatest. Her love and concern for the people she met was genuine. How I wished everything turned out great for her. She deserved TRUE LOVE and not to be used, thrown away, gotten rid of.
This song remembers me Diana Spencer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
His is great! Almost he sings with the same way the lyric "i don't have much money"! Keep create music Sir!
Sublime from start to finish. Thank you.
<3
I cry when Elton does this song. It became my daughter's song the day she was born. ❤️❤️
This celebration is all BS
❤️
OMG What a performance!!!
I wonder if the queen is in the same room as  elton john
Well done Sir Elton John my favourite song so much feeling ❤️❤️🇨🇦🇨🇦❤️❤️
Thank you Sir Elton………….Thank your Majesty for my entire life, the soul vision of stability………..God Bless the Queen from Australia ♥️🇦🇺♥️🙏🏽👏🤝
Maravilhoso
Thank you Elton John your musical ability is excellent and the best x
I'm imagining that The Queen is in the room and is his audience <3
Só lembro do meu paizinho. Que saudades, como dói viver sem ele...😭
Love You Both !!!!
An iconic performance in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace. One of my favorite sites at the Palace.
ELTON  BRILLANTE !! AMIGO DE  LA PRINCESA DIANA .  💌
Спасибо
❤️
“If I was a sculptor, but then again no Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show…”. Brilliant lyrics.   Elton John and Bernie Taupin's Your Song (written by Bernie) was written over breakfast and took a year to become a hit, but it gave Elton's career the push it needed to go stratospheric.   It’s one of the greatest songs of the 1970’s and definitely one of my favourite songs of all time.
His best performance in recent times, his gentle songs have truly aged like fine wine. I only wish he took a similar approach to that of Billy Joel & only performed biweekly to give his voice a better chance to recover. However, I appreciate all the money he raises goes towards great causes so its understandable.
simply the best
A class act 👍
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                   .. .  . . .           .,//,
❤️❤️❤️❤️
How sadly! We are all missing her! If she is still alive, William and Harry will be much happy!
this is a timeless masterpiece
This was easily the beast part of the jubilee performance and with one of the beast Elton John songs
Que emoción!
Elton Hercules John ! Keep on rocking in the free world !
elton is a real star - who can still play piano and sing with such beauty
Beautiful 💐🙏👍🌻🥂
Show, show do melhor showman👏👏👸🇧🇷Sir Elton🥂💋
Absolutely beautiful.  I never tire of hearing it. Sir Elton that was perfection and a perfect tribute.
Yes sir.
Elton John has always been dear to my heart since childhood. My elder brother would listen to his songs & passed on his admiration for Elton to me. This song is so beautiful & gives me goosebumps.  Elton is a Legend 🙏🇬🇧👏🙌❤️
FANTASTIC.just fantastic! Xx
Elton John was the first album I bought with my own money (1970)
Frieden! Peace! Мир!

Wow. His voice sounds so much better. Original key and everything!
Marvelous performance
My favo EJ song😍
One of my favourite songs😍
A beautiful tribute to Her Majesty the Queen ❤️ 👑 🙏
Elton is classic and classy
Simple chords and progressions, brilliantly stitched together.   Taupin and John - masters of their crafts Hard to believe this dates from the mid 1970's.
I watched him sing this at the Albert Hall back in the day. Just as good now as then
Yesterday stayed in Milan ❤ he was perfect 🥰 this my favourite song 🎵  great Sir!
He should disassociate himself with Harry.
I used to listen his song, he is a legendary singer.
A true legend!  Great musician and composer.
merci Elton pour le plaisir que tu m'a donné car je sais que tu viens chez nous en France pour un dernier concert que je ne verrais malheureusement je ne suis plus dans la région parisienne, bisous
Just a beautiful voice and tone, his singing is as good as ever  !!
A living legend, let's treasure his singing
Elton John the best, God bless you.🙏😥
Legend✨

Sir Elton John, you do rock with that song!!
Amazing Sir Elton John god bless your Queen🇨🇦❤️💯❤️🎂
What the hell people see in this creep beats me.
Sir Elton never disappoints! Just the greatest.
Grazie!
The right man, the perfect song, but I do hope BBC digitally fixes the typo in the imagery that was projected onto Buckingham Palace when they played this for the Jubilee event. 😬 "while YOUR in the world"?!?!?!
Elton you are class and you can’t beat class
His performance was arguably the best of the entire concert.
Unbelievable Elton John takes music to another level God he is Brilliant ⚓🌹💗
So I take it he didn't do Candle in the wind, saying: "Hey Camilla, remember this classic?"
As many said and as for me  mr.Elton's  best interpretation  of 'My Song" of all times.
A real tear jerker
what a beautiful song
How proud I am to have been learning the English language once upon a time in my life. Thank You 🇬🇧 for your music 💕. 👑70👑.
Una ennesima , magnifica interpretazione di uno dei capolavori di Elton!! Grazie di cuore per la condivisione!!!♥️♥️♥️
Thank you sir! A timeless classic that doesn’t grow old and lives on!
Aaahhhh this song ❤️ Elton is basically part of the Royal family - and Isn’t this Prince William and Duchess Kate’s first dance song at their wedding? ❤️👑🇬🇧 #platinumjubilee #platinumpartyatthepalace #royalfamily #eltonjohn
Elton John’s performance was pure magic 🌟
Gave me goosebumps
ELTON 1 ROD NIL,
Music genius - one of the greatest of all time!
It was so good see and hear Sir Elton John as he has always been close to the royals especially his late friend Princess Diana well done Elton you sang beautifully once again
This guy was picked up by God from a humble British background. This is one of the most beautiful songs ever written
it warms my heart to see him performing in the jubilee platinum
👏❤️
The tune sounds the same as that of Diana's,  Legend!
Lucky to live through a period of amazing music and songs produced by these legends.
Sir Elton is not very well, make the most of it folks.
This was Diana’s song.
This performance is what I hoped from a true artist
Belle presta...🎶🎵🎶
My favorite Elton John song...❤️
Beautiful song and tribute for the Queen on her special day ♥️
Widać tu mnóstwo włożonego serca. To był najlepszy występ ♥️
Sir Elton, one of the greatest!! Brings me back to my high school days. Thanks for the memories.
Elton John is brilliant!
I watched this live last night, i didn't think it would be anything special, but it was an incredible moment. ( edit)*  .. omg, that moment at the beginning of the concert with Her Majesty and Paddington bear was amazing.. whoever came up with that idea should get a Knighthood. so funny and touching.
Love the slightly different chord in the bridge and yes great song, great performance!
52 years on, this still makes me cry.. what a song and thank you EJ, what a fitting tribute to ER.. long live the queen (and this queen too 😀)
You’re absolutely fantastic Sir Elton John the Royal family will be so proud of you 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧🙏🙏🙏
He's still got it !
Super song :)
😘💓🎼👍✨🤩
1 man and his piano, simply wonderful!
Perfect! Merci.
Just Fabulous ❣❣❣🙏🙏🙏
EJ you are the man of our times, and have been for 50 years, an amazing accomplishment. Thank you.
Seems to be a prerecorded performance. Still a great one though.
What a voice, perfect song for the occasion
Absolutely stunning! 🎶 The highlight of the concert for me 🎹
! 💝 💯 👏 🎉 🙏 🚀 👍 🤖 🎅 ✝ 🌝!
Celebrating from Hong Kong! God save our Gracious Queen!
Also performed for Princess Diana
Needed 2 more songs. But I'm happy with this. Legend.
Legend I say ....Still sounding fantastic ...
Awesome artist saw him in New  Zealand. Hawks Bay  February 2020 just before covid closed borders around the world he was due to another couple of concerts but due to health reasons had to cancel it may be the last of his generation to grace these shores saw Fleetwood Mac and U2 in late 2019 and Rod Stewart was coming 2020 had tickets for him to with co vid pandemic around the world put a stop to allow  Elton John by far the best entertainer
Ele é mais 1 único das nossas vidas. Te amo 🙏🙏😘😘😘😘 GRATIDÃO  por todos os momentos maravilhosos de nossas vidas
🥰😍🤩🥰😍🤩🥰😍🤩🥰😍🤩
love this song what an honour to play for the queen such a legend
Just beautiful! This song holds so much meaning & sincerity. Thank you Sir Elton.💕🌻🌈
Where was Paul McCartney today?  The last Beatles in Office.
❤️❤️
Elton John voice hasn't changed at all 👍👍💪👏👏👏❤️🥳🥳🥳
Love Elton s music for over 45 years ☘️🇮🇪☘️🇮🇪☘️🇮🇪
I read somewhere and heard in an interview that 'Your Song' was what Elton John was going to dedicate in memory of Princess Dianna but the public in mourning her chose 'Candle in the wind.' So in a way Dianna still has her place in Royalty though sadly missed by most. Ironic that 'your song' was going to be for the 'Queen of Hearts' is chosen for The Queen of he united Kingdom and commonwealth platinum anniversary.
Elton John made it complete for the platinum Jubilee concert lovely song 🎵 ❤  Diana loved hearing his songs I was thinking of her what a lovely send off . God save the Queen.
Elton John nice tribute to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, but he needs to stop flying his Jets around the world and lending them to Mr and Mrs Markle.
Elton John is Harry and Meghan Markle.’s allly . In my opinion he encouraged Harry to leave the Royals. I think he blame the Queen for the death of Diana .
Ahhh the legendary Sir Elton John… beautiful and one of my fav EJ songs❤️
No words 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Linda música, linda homenagem! 🇧🇷
coming thursday I will see Elton John  for the first time live and i am very excited. One of the very last real legends standing and I´ll be there to witness it.
hee hee. Elty flubbed a note
I agree. Max
❤❤❤ watching from the Philippines
I didn’t get watching this tonight - did he actually play that live on air, or is it a pre-recording a few days old? Genuine question as I haven’t caught up yet.
Now that is what I call a good singer
Just incredible...... A timeless classic from a timeless showman...
Maravilhoso.
Sempre splendido
FANTASTICO!!!,
As celebrações são mais especiais com Elton !!! Música belíssima que eterniza o seu talento e o seu nome, como um dos maiores cantores de todos os tempos. Maravilhoso ❤ "Our Captain Fantastic "  👏👏🎉🎉❤❤
Maravilloso! Simplenente maravilloso
the forever amazing Elton John x x
Im so looking forward to seeing Elton perform this song live
Beautiful song from Guatemala
Fantastic. He sounds great 😍
Elton sempre lindo e maravilhoso beijos
Original Key! 50 some years later, and he still sings it in Eb! His voice has been through a lot, all voices change - his is certainly not what it was in 1970 - but it's a  fantastic version with his "now" voice!
I am seeing Elton in concert next year , cant wait
Elton’s voice in good Shape ❤️❤️❤️
💙
Why can we hardly see him? I feel like the cameras are hiding something?
The voice of Elton John is same to  a wine she better with time

The best performance of the show  Thank you Elton From Morocco 👍
Elton John will go down in history as one of Britain’s musical legends. This performance was outstanding, heartfelt and raw, ‘Your Song’, Elton, will never grow old.
I wish UK in UE!!! If it’s not possible…Scotland :) !!! I mish you!
My favorite song 🎵 How beautiful!
Best performance of evening.true legend.
That's the best in a while, enjoyed it
Sir Elton’s performance was easily the best, the Jubilee concert wouldn’t have been complete without him 👑👑👑🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧
Masterclass
This along with 'Come Down In Time', 'Love Song' (with Lindsey Duncan) for me is EJ at his best.  The voice is holding up well.
Beautiful musical memory Elton John - a half century of fantastic entertainment.  The British have so much to celebrate.

Einfach nur genial 😍
The minute I hear this my mind starts it's time travel
He was terrible. Time he packed it in tbh, and he's not a good mimer.
Ascoltando "dolcemente in silenzio" e "nel silenzio ascoltare ed ammirare la voce del ❤ cuore che "parla nelle prime ore del silenzio notturno altrettanto  "dolcemente". Thank you!
Come to the Brazil!!!!!
