super duper bumper hit
I have to be honest, this one was a complete miss. You get a similar story with a higher quality from the pilot episode of deep space nine.
Excellent movie! Great acting. Inspiring and Adam Sandler made me bawl.
The wife was an absolute awful human being. And a very good representative of women today
its so fitting that the director chose humans most feared animals as the alien creature, it doest have to make sense its useful metaphor, its a story.
That was a delicious, delicate piece of art ❤
I just read a book called project hail Mary it came out before this movie. This movie is such a rip off.
Adam Sandler is a gem. ❤
Ok, so I just read Project Hail Mary. As I was reading and got to the part where he meets the spider looking alien, I was like I know I've seen clips of a movie just like this. I was way off. Lol. But I really need to see this anyway!
Wow, what a skinny movie, skinny human.   If I hear skinny human one more time, I swear...  One of the biggest jokes, simply utter nonsense. They repeated "skinny human" a thousand times to probably make that inbred feel a better better about his weird shaped body.   If you love Interstellar, you'll probably love this, too. Watch it.
*mildly offended that Adam is playing a Czech* 🥴
Literally one of the stupidest movies ive ever watched i wish i could get my time back. What a waste
Brings such a powerful message all we need in life is to let go and not worry as everything is as it should be. Oh and Nutella. Nutella is very important
I will never look at a spider differently from now on after watching this movie. Spider lives matter.
Funny how Adam Sandler has finally jumped on the sci fi bandwagon. I'm only starting to watch and I'm seeing that I could eventualy add it to my favourite movie.  I really want to see Adam doing serious stuff after his past comedic past but can't unsee his secret agent to hairstylist movie hahaha hahahaha.
I was moved by this film...and loved the giant spyther!!!
Not a fan of Sandler,  however this movie is amazing..a very unique film
its rare that I see a movie that received bad reviews and I completely disagree with them, but Spaceman is one of those movies. IMO highly underrated movie.
How did this fly under my radar? Never saw it Recommended on Netflix.  Gives me project hail Mary vibes.
I just finished this movie.  Wow. An incredible movie.  I made the mistake of reading rotten tomato movies.   But I'm glad I watched it. Definitely a movie that made you think and appreciate the things you have life. Everything.  Well done Adam Sandler and Hanush.
The biggest bag of shit movie I've ever saw. Omg. Horrible
Adam Sandler is an amazing actor, he always has been.
very emotional, make you fly on the universe with imagination and amazing music this movie is phenomenal
💯 this is so loving, so kind and full of understanding, props 🎉 Adam Sandler yes!
Who would watch that AI slop Netflix is releasing now when you can watch this masterpiece.
I can't stand Adam Sandler and I cannot see him in a serious acting role.
Какое-то дерьмо Когда уже взорвут этот нетфликс
great movie. honestly 10/10
INCREDIBLY underrated, damn. I have no idea what letterboxd and imdb was watching, but this was a 4,5/5. Great great great movie.
This movie is very underrated by people, it might be because they dont understand it or dont even try to understand, but i swear its one of my favourites now. Never seen something so fascinating but yet confusing at the same time. Amazing movie, highly recommend.
Czech version of Ad Astra   I love this movie and R.I.P. Hanush😢
This movie is amazing
I would love to have the song from this trailer, it's so epic!!!
Very bad movie. a waste of time. I give it Zero star. Damm waste of time.
Should have been the song from Sam Ryder space man
Great music! Cool movie!😮
He only skinny compared to American sizes
This film really helped me during a seriously dark period in my life
For all its faults, this is Adam Sandlers best film.
It's interesting how every space movie basically tries to explain daddy or mommy issues instead of any deeper purposes of pursuit of knowledge or discovery.
For anyone wondering if they should watch this movie. Don’t think anymore, it is a breathtaking experience. For me it highlights the true essence of life. Love.
Reincarnated as a spider but in space
its funny hearing adam so quiet when he’s more known for being loud and annoying in his roles 😂
Spaceman is a self discovering acid trip in space with a giant spider 🕷️
Reminds me of the song "The comissiin" By the band  Breton. I would advise people to check out the film clip. Yiu will be moved i swear
Great movie with 2001: Space Odyssey vibes
Shelob went transgender.
His accent that is on/off and barely there made me lol a few times during this movie.
i had goosebumps when i read that its from the director of chernobyl. what a great series man, i think i will like that movie
And all the A++holes, movie critics, psychotherapist, know-it-alls ,and Arachnid experts all come out of the woodwork at once!!  With or without the Scooter Stick!! 🤦🥳
Nice movie
Do not be afraid
I'm kinda done with Netflix movies... the only reason I might watch this is because they made the  protagonist a Czech, I'm a Czech too and I wonder why they did that and how it's gonna play out. Other than that... meh
Is it just me or is the trailer weird looking
This is a Sandler film I'd actually pay to see in a theatre.  Naturally, it's not playing in one.
I highly respect Adam Sandler, but this was a crap movie, it wasted my time.
imagine hetrosexual people ruining my cool alien spider film by shoving their lifestyle down our throats with ANOTHER story about how they dont actually like each other 🙄 Its just pandering at this point.
I didn’t like how they made Sandler’s character the villain. He wasn’t a good husband but they tried to justify it like he deserved to be abandoned to the absolute desolation and isolation of deep space. It felt like yet another “all men are the enemy” Hollywood bs message. Especially him begging and apologizing near the end.
Adam Sandler found a new range. So happy to see it unfold.
Never thought I'd cry for a giant space spider
Amazing movie
Adam sandler loves pizza.
This was a masterpiece.
Already seen solaris
I just found this gem a couple days ago, watched it tonight, and I'm baffled by the imdb rating. One of the most beautiful films I've seen in years, excellent acting from everyone, interesting premise, heavy theme, great execution. I can't even remember the last time I shed some tears on a movie. My lady wasn't interested based on the trailer, definitely gonna sit her down to it tomorrow, I need to see it again anyway to wrap my heart around the feelings it engulfed.
The spider is actually from the planet Australia.
Man embarks on a mission to better humanity and provide for his family back home, highly likely to never return, sacrificing everything for others.  Woman cries that she has it so rough
i've already seen the first episode of star trek DS9.  this movie was way worse than that.
A movie about "The Alpha and the Omega". I love the creativity of this movie.
Paul Dano is a freak. Awesome cast.
bro aint no way after a year nobody is  asking what the song in the trailer is called! Whats the name of the  SONG ?????????
This is a very bad adaptation of Project Hail Mary isn’t it. Dammit, why ruin such a fantastic story?
👏👏👏 ❤
I found this movie through clip from youtube short. Immediately open netflix and watch it.this movie create deep thought about how lonely yet social i am. I surrounded by friends and family, yet, my selfish self doesn't open my heart to them. This is truly one of the best movies i have watch in recent weeks Edit: btw as a interstellar-like space movie, this movie is not that good. But as a character-driven philosophy thought provoking movie, this movie is good.
Omg why am i crying from a trailer
Is this returnal the movie?
What ? Grows!!! A giant spider
Never been a fan of Sandlers low brow comedy but Uncut Gems and this show off his true talents! Marvellous and heartfelt  movie ❤
This was an incredible movie. I bawled my eyes out and adam Sandler crushed this role. That giant spider was amazing. I loved him.
Omg Painful trying to watch this. Yawn fest for real!
This movie was dope and soothing, yet touching a place in the heart that holds pain and regret! I loved it!
wouldve watched this if it wasnt for the giant spider
no movie if they just send up an introvert, sheesh
Loved it, it makes us feel human..
Talking to a spider. No thanks 1:28
so i came back here after watching this movie to tell you: its good. that shti is deep.
This movie is all about reading in between the lines 🙏✨ The cloud is the unknown, Adam goes for it towards the unknown scared yet willingly and faces his fears supported by the Spider Being that represents many many things (the embrace is Sandler embracing his fears to be able to realease them let them go). Light can not be contained ♾️✨♾️ (the part where he tries to capture the light particle in the cup 😉) and when the spider is transmuted (transformed back to Light) represents the final letting go of what already served us, opening our hearts and be rebirthed by Light(clarity to be able to see, expand and flow with the grace of the youniverse) ✨🪽💎♾️
Ngl I search Adam sandler movies, saw this and laughed so hard at how ridiculous this is. 😂 he’s tryna be serious but it looks so cringe with the spider and whatnot 😂 never gunna watch this trash fire
Someone saw the BlackMirror episode in space and decided to make it their own... complete with the spider alien trying to comfort the human
Worst movie of all time
Adam Sandler is a very actor.  Just overlook all those stupid movies he made like waterboy
Okay first a black spiderman, now a talking spider? Im out bro. I just watched it and I want to vomit and commit suicide
This was terrible. Stinky movie
This movie is absolutely amazing, which says a lot considering it’s a drama and Adam Sandler is the lead character
What in the "wanna be Project Hail Mary" is going on here?
If you have patience and interest in how the inner and outer universe are connected. THIS IS IT SKINNY HUMANS.
The music in this trailer is phenomenal.
what a great movie
無理がありすぎる設定がちょこちょこ入るのがイタいな 韓国に先駆け？ チェコが？ まず韓国ロケットすら作れないよ？ アメリカや日本のテクノロジーならわかるけど 韓国？ スマホやEV車爆発させまくるレベルなのに？ 素人が脚本書いたの？
I never knew that i could like a giant scary spider so much❤
Skinny human did well
Weirdest movie ever bro
Where’s my spider lol
This movie was definitely not what i expected, and I'm incredibly glad i watched it. Every moment of the movie is so well made. I wish i could forget about it so i could watch it and experience it all over again.
Very surprised Adam S , superb movie totally different Actor excellent performance  😮
The comment section, quite disgustingly, is all about the actor. Not the movie and the ones who put in most of the work here.
Adam Sandler as an astronaut....................great cast choice and so believable..........................
Demon spawn of ungoliant!
RAHHHHHH PAUL DANO
So...how long before he fucks the spider?
Why the hell is an American acting he is European??
This can't end well. Hope its not a black widow.
Maybe not one of the best movies ive seen but decent. Great acting, beautifully shot and ill always love a good slow sci-fi!
Dont they realise WOMEN HATE SPIDERS AND CANT STAND TO WATCH THE MOVIE BECAUSE OF THAT ONE OVERSIGHT 😂 YOU IDIOTS MAKE SOME FURRY LOVEABLE CREATURE ... nooooo lets go with SPIDER 🕷  ALIEN 👽
This must be one of those giant telepathic spiders from Rick and Morty... 'Keep Summer Safe'? Nah, this one's on a mission to keep Adam Sandler confused, emotional, and questioning all his life choices!
Woah. This looks as good as Interstellar. 💯 blown away by Sandler. Amazing
I didnt like the movie at all but I watched to the end
So The Other  Character is A Spider with #6 Eyes Talking  Like A human  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 😂😂😂😩😩 😀😀 Nope  I'll Pass 😔
Don't bother. I watched this in two sections. Both uninspiring and tedious. It drags sooo badly and there is never really anything good that happens.  Typical film for ppl to sniff and proclaim 'you didn't get it.'  Spend your time doing ANYTHING else.
I have watched this movie yesterday and it reminded me of The Little Prince. The cosmonaut is the Little Prince sesrching for something, the "spider" is like the fox who made him realize that the most impirtant thing in his life is that who he had left behind (Lenka), and Lenka is the rose, the most important thing that was left behind.
this movie sucked
O.k. so he's a lonely astronaut, so is the alien a lonely astronaut too?  Looks like they become a pair of ASStronauts.  😊😊😊😊😊
Is the movie still on Netflix in December 2024?
Looks depressing, that's the last thing I need to  watch.
All involved should spend the rest of their lives in prison for this
Yeeei🖤🖤🖤🥰 something to watch tonight
Film lungo, lento e noioso, non si capisce assolutamente niente nemmeno verso al finale, anzi al contrario diventa ancora più confusionario.  Non vengono spiegate tante scene perciò molte cose non hanno assolutamente senso, le scene si confondono e lo spettatore fa fatica a seguire gli avvenimenti del film. Gli effetti speciali sono banali e mediocri, che cazzo di significato ha inserire un ragno gigante che parla come il compagno di un astronauta? Non vengono seguite le leggi della fisica pure i film degli anni '90 hanno più senso di questo scempio. Netflix approva film assolutamente insensati, dovrebbe filtrare alcuni film ed evitare che le persone interagiscano con certi contenuti come questo. Non adatto ai racnofobici o persone che han paura degli insetti. In generale non adatto proprio a nessuno.
Is this a ripoff of Project Hail Mary? Seriously
So this is a movie about a man who thinks he's in outer space but is actually just in Australia?
The extent of people thinking I had options, is so heavy. I can't imagine the weight of others in similar.
Excellent...on every level that counts...just wonderful....was sad when it ended...i wanted more....its the movie the world needs right now
MOVIE NAME: Spaceman
Adam Sandler inexplicably an astronaut for the Czech Republic, that well known space faring nation, gets shit about his relationship from the most passive-aggressive nosey spider in the universe in a tedious 2 hours of dullness and cheap psychology broken only by massively glaring plot holes, and a complete waste of a talent like Carey Mulligan.  Woke up this morning after watching it last night, feeling a bit depressed after a maudlin dream about my ex. I blame the movie.  Avoid this movie and instead spend the time watching paint dry - it'll be a more pleasant and interesting way to pass the time 😤🥱😑
Castaway but in space....Featuring Wilson as Hanus.
the only highlight is a softspoken spider in space, no joke and no pest control with space gun. And adam sandler is not getting turned into a spiderman from a bite.
I do hope this doesn't start a wave of people purchasing an "emotional support spider". People, in general, are really bad at taking care of their pets. Back in the day we just called them pets. Good to see Adam and Aragog really branching out into different roles.
Pass. Adam Sandler can be a good actor but this feels far too manufactured for my tastes. I all for a Sci fit character study but hard pass on this, feels forced even in the trailer.
One of the worst movies I’ve ever seen. With the most anticlimactic ending ever
The music reminds me of the music from Nier Automanta.
00:10 GOMEN AMANAI...
I think Adam Sandler got a bad rap for drama and serious roles because the first one he did was Punch-Drunk Love and that was f****** stupid and horrible
Six months in isolation is laughable. Ive been living by myself for 35 years😂
😭I cried like a baby when the spider passed
Alpha and Omega.
"Your shameful waste will not hold what you're looking for"😅
Sandler is brilliant in this role, and this is a movie all should see...philosophic, mesmerizing. I've seen it 3 times and still discover something new.
"Then he shouldn't have left" can there ever be a movie or show where the main character does something grand for the better of mankind, and his girl aint a bitch about it?
This looks like Rocketman but depressing and stupid
this movie looks stupid AF
They ruined project hail marry on this thing 😢
Adam Sandler is still funny even trying to play a more serious role. I can’t even take home serious 😂
even in space Adam Sandler will, Shorts and socks. lol! Jokes aside, I love that he got this role, he’s so much more capable than the typecasting he’s been through
Why are every space movies always so boring and depressing? I don't even looking forward to any American space movies more. I watch only Russian movies. Russian makes awesome movies.
It's like a cheap cut of the book project hail Mary
This Trailer really doesn't fit the vibe of the movie in my opinion. A more subtle calm yet slightly off putting vibe would set the mood greatly as that's what you usually feel at first until you get more comfortable
Don't be afraid, skinny human, this movie reminded me  "Cast Away" with Tom Hanks. Hanus the spider reminded me of Wilson ..
Im honestly mostly intrigued by how they speak. THe spider and Adam sandler speak so.. quietly and slowly.
I hate when the spider dies I cried
How did they manage to make the trailer look like an action movie
So they often send 58 year old men on space missions lol
I dont know what type of a person I am but I loved it. not just loved it but see it as a masterpiece. i dont agree w the interstellar thing. not once did I think about the interstellar. the hug between the two of them or the moment when he said u never asked about me is just something else. its really dissapointing to think about the fact that such a movie that i see as a masterpiece is just not it for other people. but maybe that is what it makes this movie different as well. it feels like they wanted to creat something uniqe but not w the target of big achievements and big awards money and admiration. i like this mentality. like a hiden diamond that is not hungry for attention but for peace and just allows the people watching it decide about it and not the big medias and critics. I admire this.
Does Dunkacino make a cameo appearance?
❤ I literally loooooveeeeeee this movie. Was so pleasant, stressful, Tense, helpful, reality checks all in one. I COULD WATCH IT HUNDREDS OF TIMES
I never watched a movie that made me cry like this. Many people will not understand the underlying story behind this....
An alien spider and skinny human bromance , utterly bizarre yet warm interactions .
I’ve always found Adam Sandler to be annoying, and that’s why I hesitated to watch this movie. But I was so throughly impressed. I’ve never seen anything like this before. I probably still wouldn’t watch one of Sandler’s comedies, but this is now one of my favorite films. I can’t stop thinking about it.
"屁孩"、”娘砲“、“g a y” 砲會做的事就是穿耳洞，噁爛加三級，有礙觀瞻，看到就堵爛 ，可悲之人。 Male ear piercing ... Really disgusting , low standard ,unsightly,immature... undesirable behavior Shame on u Pathetic
Good Job Adam
I have decided to allow a jumping spider to live in my house.... I better not get bit
What a movie 🥹
Communicating live with Earth. Even though it takes the signals over half an hour to reach. Is there any explanation for this?
Фильм потрясающий и недоступный для понимания большей части живущих на Земле. Понятие абсолютной любви в эквиваленте человеческих чувств. Ум человека не способен пропустить душу на столь высокий уровень ограничивая эго. Ощутить такую глубину человек способен, если отодвинут эго на второй план. Большинство людей приходят к этому на пороге смерти, когда нет смысла держаться за материальные ценности.  Любви и счастья вам, читающие это❤❤❤
Another butchered storyline. The heck is this?
This was SOOOOO GOOD!
I'd squish that spider in an instant. And enjoy doing it.
why am i just now learning about this movie
Do not trust spiders
Guys usually run away from wives.😅
🥺😓Now I’m crying😭
I’m just watching this movie tonight.  I’ve always appreciated Adam in drama roles, he’s one of my favorite actors. This Spider 🤯🤯😱😱.OMG
I just watched this movie and I have to say that it was absolutely incredible. So compelling and really great acting on behalf of the cast. Made me cry multiple times.
they stored DMT on the ship that it folks.
I’m just watch this movie, I love it, the spider it’s the best emotional support
title should be called Spaceman’s Wife
My partner doesn't understand how a spider got into the spaceship, thoughts?
Pity he doesn't fake the Czech accent.
That movie is a w movie I saw it one night and I was IMPRESSED!!
Does this movie not sound like the same shit that’s happening to the people out of space who are now stuck for another 6 months …
This movie has me sobbing. To me, it was reminiscent of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Interstellar. The lesson of love is so powerfully deep, and hit home. Amazing movie.
HANOOSH 😊
Very Russian!
3rd rate rip off of Solaris. 5th rate
This movie was so weird  But good. I forgot wht happened.  I think he ended up out the ship
At the first look, I really thought it was a movie based on a book called "project hail Mary" by Andy Weir. And I was wrong and a bit disappointed 😊
A truly moving picture.
Watching this shit high af
Spider name was so funny when  he said Hanoosh 😂😂😂. Couldn't stop laughing
Which word is used in this movie  Repository or noodles?
Adam Sandler's Moon
Just watched this movie and I didn't get it. 😔
Just finished watching this and wow! I’m amazed! I cried 😭 Adam Sandler is amazing! Thank you Netflix
Just cant watch it....   adam sandler was amazing as the jerky boys.....i cant take him seriously and have grown to be bored of him      kinda sad.   He is talented,   i just dont like hime anymore :/
This was a beautiful film. Adam deserves more recognition as a drama actor.
Sadly this movie reflects society today. Good movie. Probably Sandler’s Mona Lisa.
Look, i realize Adam Sandler is the original Mr chick flick dude but this is the worst piece of trash i ever watched in my life. There are not words for how smelly this thing is. WTF did i just watch?   Spiders are carnivorous.  You get some crazy A mouth spider you call Ganoosh back at spaceship central and have him put you in cryosleep so it can be surgically removed by Sigourney Weavers crack team of F'ing monster doctors.   What you never do is hug it and share your chocolate with it. He will be lucky if he dosent get butt spiders from the good place crawling out of his rear end.   My good Lord, i can write a script better than this one . I see that spider im shooting it and launching it out of the decompression chamber right back to hell.❤
If interstellar made you cry, this will make you cry too.
this movie is so beautiful. the last scene with Hanus had me so emotional. this is a 10/10 masterpiece of a movie
Why did it have to be a spider
First off I would of been freaked tf out I would of crashed the whole ship seeing that thing pop out on me like that
I dont like the trailer.
DMT
Looks like it is based off of Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir
would anyone give me the name of that song in the background? i've been looking for it :C
Omg i cried so much with this..MASTERPIECE
The most boring, confusing and uninteresting space movie I’ve ever seen.
5.7 on IMDB- wow, i truly can no longer trust IMDB- great movie
As a cinematographer with over 10 years of experience in camerawork, editing, and color grading, I have to applaud the look and feel of this movie. I love the experimental camera angles and the fluidity of the shots. From a technical standpoint, I truly enjoyed this movie.  However, when I evaluate it purely as a viewer, I find the movie incredibly bland, overly philosophical, and unengaging. I'm not very familiar with Adam Sandler's work, but I felt he didn't convey his character's emotions effectively (in terms of facial expressions, body language, and manner of speech).  The entire performance felt very artificial, as if I were watching one of my interns play a role. This repeatedly took me out of the experience. It felt like I only saw 10% of a movie, while the other 90% was missing. If that makes sense?  Now, for the spoiler part:  For me, the movie went like this:  - Adam tries to act like he's emotionally sad and lonely. - Suddenly meets a space spider. - There's a bit of suspense because you don't know whether the spider is hostile. - The spider somehow becomes a friend and likes eating Nutella (??). - Weird kaleidoscope scenes of Adam missing his wife. - Bla bla bla. - The spider takes him out into space. - The spider dies. - Adam has a trippy vision about him and his wife. - The movie ends.  I'll give it a 3/10, but only because of the cinematography. Without the impressive camera angles and rich color grading, it would have been a 1.5/10 for me…
Turned it off when spider appears.
Adam Sandler as an astronaut? that's believable.
must be an Australian space station they can run but cant hide from their million  spider species
Is this movie worth the watch? I like Adam Sandler, and most of his movies, but there are some that aren't so good. So I need to know, is it good? The trailer throws me off, idk how to feel. Please give me your honest opinion! Thank you! 🙏🏻😁
okay you wasted my 2 hours. dude if you are not capable, dont go to space
Came to the comments first before watching and it never fails
"It's not without some fear, but i can leave you now". I've never thought that an alien spider would made me cry.
Do him and the spider kiss?
This movie is a 9/10. Don't listen the media.
I would be well suited to such a long term Solo Mission. I would be happy with 12 months without any Human Contact.
This whole thing looks like the Book 'Project Hail Mary' from Andy Weir...
This movie made me feel
Adam Sandler is an amazing actor serious and comedy
Seem like a nice movie, but dam I hate spiders
Paul Dano as a voice actor is perfect he killed it as the riddler and I can’t wait to see this now
THE.  BEST.  FILM.   E V E R!!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤  For all humanity.  We are on the brink of some extraordinary sh!t. Hope is ALL!
I need a Hanus in my life too 😢
I loved this movie. Very thought provoking and sullen. The themes of missed opportunities and self reflection really resonated with me. I actually found myself crying at the end which is extremely rare.  It's a slow burn. But if you go in with an open mind, you may find yourself being drawn in.
што ето я хотів подивиця трейлер а уляна не давольна ти шлюха їбана ілля
Inredible... What a boring movie.. Just incredible.. Lost 2 hours of my life on this garbage
WHAT?! A Netflix original that's not woke and hyper-inclusive? This is strange
whoever mdae this is my biggest opp rn
Idk about yall but that spider scared tf out of im not eatching this
Als ich die Spinne sah, war ich raus.
Am I the only one who thought 'when is he going to eat him' 😂
This movie made me feel like I was in real life
Todo lo que sea de adam sandler enarbolando banderas del genocidio debe sersaboteado
One of the worst comedian actors plays really good in dramat, what a tvist
Dear YouTube Algorithm, how dare you keep such things away from my eyeballs. I give you my attention and even let you pick the channels and you omit such things from me? Unacceptable algorithm, completely unacceptable.
Looks like a rip off of Project Hail Mary :/
we could assume that a man is cold-hearted. but even so, The woman in this movie is selfish and self-centered.
load of Crap
weak movie if an astronaut would be so weak minded i doubt any person like that in that kind of mindset can become an astronaut
As someone with severe arachnophobia... this movie made me feel very conflicted.
I couldn't hang on longer than 20 minutes
Rocketman sequel is looking really weird.
Why a spider!!!!!!
Always like Adam Sandler
That's where the children of Shelob went... Interesting...
Sony/Columbia Pictures (100 Years)/Wayfarer/Black Bear (2024)
Why couldn’t the ‘thing’ be a bear or dolphin? Always have to have major creep 😢. Ok, I’ve only watched 25 minutes but seriously, why ?
this movie reminds me of (Charlotte's web) also a movie made for people to stop being afraid of spiders ,im glad they made this 'modern' one ,so that people would actualy see it
Didn't f@rt on anyone's 80085 I was disappointed.
Ignore the reviews of this movie. Watch it for yourself
“BE NOT AFRAID”
Damn dude this looks good
Who does Kevin James play in this one?
The concept of this movie reminds me of a side story in Lucifer's graphic novel. A lonely boy that have troubles in explaining his feelings, so with a pure coincidence, he found a portal that took him to an entirely new world out of the creation, and there he met a talking huge spider that can sense and read his emotions and weave them into colourful silk that radiate emotions and they become a close friends and he helped him fighting his loneliness.
Фильм о том что можно сойти с ума из за отношений с дурной женщиной, в космосе, на земле, во сне, везде😂
Boring movie with too much relationship
That lady sounds exactly like she did in death becomes her🥴
Man really said "be not afraid"
This movie unlocked something inside me I just never knew was there. The deep sadness that came over me was just unexplainable. The loneliness and the storyline plays on your heart strings. My only regret is not being able to watch it again for the first time.
Just watched it and it’s ok, not great though. I think more needed to happen to get the pace going. The focus on Sandlers wife needed a backstory told through real time rather than flashbacks and hallucinations.  Like make half the film on earth before he goes to space. The spider can be viewed however you want but yes your instincts telling you that it shouldn’t be in the story are correct, it’s annoying, the catchphrase ‘skinny human’ is due to the weight loss in the book, Sandler is far from skinny, it’s not ironic just annoying.  The spider looks 10 ft wide and 2 ft wide in other scenes and goes on and on about Sandlers wife for seemingly an hour. I love the idea that a space alien with tentacles is an all intelligent being, but this was a not very intelligent spider who was not fun like flight of the navigator nor was the emotional connection there like that film.  I love that they tried something different but that annoying puppet won’t be back on my telly in a hurry. It wasn’t deep enough, funny enough, dramatic enough or though provoking enough. The universe has so many wonders and humanity has so many lengths it just didn’t pull itself together in a meaningful or engaging way. Yes it’s open to interpretation which is good, it’s just not that much more than an ‘ummm ok’ or a ‘wrf.is this’ or a ‘come on move on now’ It’s strongest message is about spirituality in which it miss times its entire journey to its climax is both a fault of the scriptwriters and the editors and director. That spirituality is a 7/10 at best. Overall I’m sorry but it’s a 4/10 from me.I would have preferred a story with half of it on earth and an octopus that flies him around the universe unlocking secrets before plopping him home and him realising there’s no place like home. Another thing is Adam Sandler always outstays his welcome in his films. The spider really outstayed its welcome, and you truly feel the disconnect with it being a CGI character.
Little movie review here:  This was one of the very few films in history that would have been better if it DIDNT follow the source material of the book. The creature is basically acting as a teen girls therapy councillor and the movie is very slow and nothing happens until the last 4 minutes. Should have renamed the movie to ‘Insanely Slow Therapy Spider’ 🤦‍♂️   The movie was actually quite good, it had an incredible alien design maybe one of the best ‘spider’ creatures I’ve ever seen done in CGI, and Adam Sandler playing one of his all time best performances. What a shame this wasn’t an original script and they had to follow the book effectively wasting the movie spending 99% of the movie crying about his ex. That could have been addressed and handled in the first 10 minutes and turned into a completely better movie with a better ending. My biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn’t address the fact that he is talking to a fking giant hairy creepy 10 foot long spider that invades his personal space constantly and tries to get into his bedroom and bathroom, yet Adam Sandler’s character isn’t horrified by this in any way as he wanted a friend? That’s not realistic, any normal person would be freaking the f out and having panic attacks if they saw that thing.  As the other comments say, this movie is only really for those who are going through some serious spiritual trauma in their life.
bro wtf
1:46
Is he really wearing those dopey basketball shorts in the movies now???
New favorite
So many people didn't get this movie. You need emotional intelligence and experience in life to truly feel it. But if you do, you will adore this movie
That is Actually Really Cool
What’s the soundtrack used in the trailer? I can’t find it😭
Anyone else get “Project Hail Mary” by Andy Weir vibes when they saw this?
the movie is amazing. great character dev
The masterpiece that is this movie, the effect it creates hits you days after you've seen it. It's melancholic and surreal.   And Carey Mulligan had to just be in it too. She's perfect!
Nooo he didn’t return back home to his wife and kid
Ouuuu death becomes her!
Worth watching.  Its not an action movie so if you want that dont watch it.  It is a thought provoking movie.
f  king boring movie I expected SF!! NOT FKING COUPLE THING!!!
I am quite the movie buff and was skeptical about this one... man, was i wrong. Amazing movie, it's going in my top 10. Great exploration of the human condition, loneliness, isolation, depression, generational trauma as well as one's relationship to themselves, their partner & the universe. I would have never thought i would say this, but great job, Adam Sandler and Channing Tatum :)))
I bet that Spider came from Kern's World or another terraformed planet by Ancient Earth scientists
The real saddness hit me when Hanuz died , a really emotional yet intriguing movie .Adam Sandler just hit the homerun on this one ✅
the first question I had was why is his surname czech.  Then I saw the czech flag Now I realise its a czech author's story.  nice to see my home country's authors getting recognition.
What a great movie. I can not fathom why the ratings are so low. This is a absolute beast of a movie you will keep thinking about for a long time
Fortunately, this can't happen to me, I can't ever be described as "Skinny Human."
Xxxx yyuyuy
Not bad , Unnecessarily depressing tho. Melancholy might be a better word.
Just found out about this movie and about tio give it a try, but I am not a fan of seeing Sandler in a drama so not expecting this to be any good, only reason I am watching is cause of the special guest that appears in his ship as I am curious what that is all about. ____________ Watched it all and I knew better cause this movie was BAD,  your all NUTS!  Sandler stick to Comedies cause Drama is not for you.  And who was this Ugly female in it?  I know your old now Sandler, but stick to better looking Women playing as your Female love interest.
This movie was fantastic ,omg my wife hates space shows and sandler and she loved it. Wow!
This is basically Project hail Mary but with a couple different bits
Верните  NETFLIX в РОССИЮ
I love Adam Sandler but this movie was overly depressing and just weird.
What is the music in the background? 1:03
Adam Sandler rocks! Great movie
Totally garbage 😢 movie dont watch it don't read comments here all are warm of emotions 😅
I like how these kinda ppl do a misconception on loneliness and isolation if you've experienced you'll know what I'm talking about these people are manipulative or stuck on misconception of loneliness, that's why you can't embrace it.
Any need this song ASAP
totaly not inspired by Project Hail mary
he has no acting at all...he uses the same wardrobe on every movie, the same face and the same character just diferent scenarios and co-stars'. and i like his comic movies, but he should stay in there.  my humble opinion of couse.
You'll gonna either love it or feel bored with it, and I am here for it, love it so muchhh!!!
His last name is the same a jiri lol
3 letters: W  T   F
Movie was amazing! Great performance by Adam Sandler! Very philosophical film.. I will say, anyone under 25ish will probably give this movie a bad rating/review due to their short attention span and lack of empathy/emotion. Just being honest here. It's a generational thing, that's all
IF DIS COMMENT STILL BE HERE ND I DIDNT DELETE IT,,  DEN DIS MOVIE BE LITTI3 I'm gased up off diesel ⛽️  to dis one Ayo dis movie definitely worth da watch ⌚️  I be eating chicken nachos with a pizza nd pop nd a big loud bag of da w33d🌬✨️   ALSO I CONTAINE ENRGY FROM OUT OF THIS PLANET BC OF 5 SORUCES 1.

space therapy looks stupid
Reminds me of Gyllenhaal's movie with a giant spider.
One of the most beautiful films I have ever seen
Film sampah.. Buang2 waktu menontonnya..
Beautiful movie , we'll rite and we'll acted. Really speaks to you in volumes.
Did I just hear Shodan speak in the beginning?
is the fact that he is czech come in as important in the story, why not just make it an american spaceman
sitting in a tin can.....
When he gave hanus the hazelnut at end I balled crying
Such a crappy movie
I really thought it was gonna be boring. The conversation about the beginning gave me chills, i got mad too when Hanus found out Jakub was a selfish man, and it also made me feel guilty that i didn't want Hanus to leave me too.
Payment sent
Stick to you're cheesy crap b grade movies.
0:54 Well you did
I m scared of all kinds of bugs and spiders as well, they make my skin crawl but the spider here was such a great and comforting character I never got scared nor disliked it. I loved the idea of comfort not coming from familiar or so called beautiful things but rather from uncomfortable, dark and scary things
This is by far the most touching movie I have seen in recent years, and I cried several times. I am sad to see many critics rate this masterpiece average when it had so many elements to make it critically acclaimed, esp critics love out of box, never done before kind and deep movies and this had everything. Hope more people find it and heal from it, for me it was such a comfort.
Such a beautiful movie, I love how a so called scary spider could actually be a comfort, how most humans chase after bigger purpose and success to find happiness when it's right next to them, how unappreciative we are of the things we have. For me I believe the spider was real and was wandering in space for a long time, so it got lonely too, and because of that, it was drawn to the main character, I believe love and feelings intrigued the spider and understanding emotions, I believe not only main character but spider too was healed by their time together. Made me cry several times and I think I would want to watch it again when I m feeling down
i thought it was going to be a Hail Marry adaptation
It lacks substance
Also too I just had an idea for a Happy Gilmore sequel! As he got a little older he quit golf and played tennis for a bit! Now retired he's killing it on pickle ball courts!
This looks amazing!! Can't wait til I have the chance to see it!!
The basic premise, without knowing anything about the movie, reminds me of Project Hail Mary
looks boring as shit
I cant even watch this movie because the thing looks like a fuckin spider...
Was fuxken lame. The spider was/is stupid and lazy/idiotic. Only douchbags who think this got meaning thought it was good hahahaha
You telling me out of all the adjectives in the English language and this intelligent spider uses the word skinny?  The whole movie you see him running but no above the chest shots. Sandler= 🤡
-Where... exactly is your home? -Australia
Children of Time, but one human and one spider
Paroding classic music in trailer  Adam sandler   Yes itd shity movie
This movie would be way cooler if the spider was a real alien spider that had an alterior motive to eat the astronaut, instead of an imaginary friend spider.
I loved it!!!
i did not just CRY over a spider 😭
Watched it because of space spiders. Enjoyed it deep meaning and emotional journey. Few people i watched it with find it boring and slow paced. It's a beautiful script with deep meaning
he better get with that spider
I truly loved this movie... Hanus ❤
I still get emotional when I remember Click Adam Sandler can go hard in these roles.
This is about another woman breaking up her family and leaving because she isn't happy 😂. Remember men that 70% to 80% of women file for divorce. Even the lesbians are 70+% 😂.
Loved the movie. It's so unique and different. Adam did an absolutely amazing job with his character.
Я почему-то думал что он только в комедиях играет
gäääähhhhnnnn
this is not a movie for arachnophobes
I'm considering watching this movie.... it might be a good idea to help process things
No film mega prawdziwy żadna miłość  nie przetrwa na odeglos obojetne czy człowiek czy inna cywilizacja jak już chce być odkrywca czy marsa , księżyca to powinni rekrutować  osoby nie związane emocjonalnie z ziemią  pokazało to już wiele ekranizacji. Jak to moja babcia  mówiła niema miłości na odległość  a to są warunki o których  babcia  nie miała pojęcia.
I'm halfway on the film I'm trying to convince myself to finish it.thats why I'm reading comments here
Did anyone watch the movie?? Any ratings please
Seemed like a pretty stupid pot head movie to me
What a beautiful film! <3
So good. ❤
Brilliant film ... still cant work out if he was hallucinating or it was real
This movie could have been good. Not enough sci-fi or action in my opinion started loosing interest while watching. 30 min. of his wife could be cut out of the film to make it better.
Is this move just a really bad rip off of  the novel  Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir? Spider and man in space? I think that it may be. But the differences are enough to deny. Let me know if you think that it may be. And if you have not read (or listened to on Audible),  Narration by Ray Porter) (Ray is one of my top 3 narrators.) Hail Mary....you should. It's in my top 10 books I have listened to on Audible.
this makes me want a live action of that creepy space spider from love death robots
One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Long drawn out story with so many unanswered questions and horrible ending.
Why do I feel like I wanna watch this but seriously..my arachnaphobia won't let me 😂😂 I hope if I get the guts to watch it that the spider isn't just gonna eat him at the end 😂
Boooooring .. skinny human
One of Adams friends bet he couldn't win an Oscar and the man is going for it
wasted off  6 minutes!!!!!
Love.
Adam was great but this movie sucks! This is the worst movie of adam sandler
Just watched this last night. I have a serious case of arachnophobia but wanted to try and watch this (mainly for Adam Sandler playing another serious role) and I actually found the giant spider Hanus quite cute and (spoiler) was so sad he died at the end.
Rule of Sandler  If he directs: 99% chance it was to get him and his buddies a pay check. (I respect the hustle) If he doesn't, it will be god
Omg Adam

name song plz
Really good and touching movie
I literally just finished watching this movie. It made me cry
Sandler deserves an award for this performance. He was faultless
35 minutes into this movie and I've always liked Adam Sandler in comedies. But this movie is boring as hell. Never thought I'd give Adam Sandler a thumbs down. But he's getting a thumbs down. Talking to a giant spider. No action just boring talking to this damn spider. I'll continue trying to watch it hope it gets better but I doubt it.
"i just want to cum home" got me feeling oooo, aaaa, ooo, ooo !
This movie was beautiful. The music was good, Adam Sandler did great and the spider creature was very symphatetic and interesting character.
This film is based on a book and people that rated this on imdb and rotten tomatoes don't seem to get it. This movie is definitely not for everyone as it is a really slow burn, but it's really a great film.
Movies are getting so lame and boring. Real life is much more bazaar
I just finished watching this , a very excellent movie , I 101% recommend this , all about a characteristics of a human , guilt , fear , greed , everything , discovering one self ..   But I still feel bad about Hanus 😂
I wonder what the spider would call me? It sure wouldn't be skinny human...
This movie changed my outlook on life.
Incredible film!
it appeared to me as a being/ Higher Self, his own Higher Self in the shape of a Spider. I love his 6 eyes. There was an innocence and an accent wisdom coming from the being
I loved this movie, very moving..I really loved the spider, I believe it was a being, camouflage as a spider, Higher Self
Чехословакия великая космическая держава 😂😂😂  Балтийские тигры* нация победителей 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 За актёра отдельное спасибо 😂 Лучше бы старичка Арнольда пригласили, глупым комедийным говном со стороны бы не воняло 💩😂😂😂👍
spooder
Weird movie, the worst Adam Stander movie to date.
I feel more sorry for Hanus than Lenka.
I haven't even seen this and I can already tell he's imagined this whole scenario.  No need to watch.
I like Adam Sandlers Comedy movies, but his Drama roles are so captivating
I love this movie. I just ordered the book.
i hate spiders omg lol
R I P HANUS
Anyone curious about this movie before watching should know this is a movie for those on a spiritual path. Don’t go by the commercial ratings of this movie. The movie is very slow paced with exploring the themes of spirituality, sacrifice, love, loss, fear and acceptance. While all the earth moments and interactions are predictable it’s the space conversations that will keep you drawn and connecting the dots of your life and humanity. Again, you’ll get this movie if you’re on a spiritual path and not watching the movie for entertainment value. Bless you 🙏
Amazing film haven’t seen a film make me feel the way this one did!!!
This is the most ridiculous movie I have seen in a long, long time.  Complete waste of time.
But why a spider?
Man, the Spider-verse is getting f***ing crazy.
Soon has I see a spider hole spaceship 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hayatımdan aldığınız 01:48 dk için alayınızın Allah belasını versin
Honey, I found a movie I think will cure your arachnophobia...
This movie is phenomenal. It was like Interstellar, Solaris, and Children of Time all wrapped together. Adam Sandler has reconstructed his career remarkably.
the closest we'll ever come to seeing Sandler in a Tarkovsky film
absolutely fantastic movie ,thought provoking with a spiritual awakening.....Big up Adam Sandler
I watched this today... a rare miss by Adam Sandler, it was terrible!
💩🎥🎬
Good movie , make sure don’t shoot again.
1:23  so what he becomes a fleshlight?
Anyone know the name of the song? Ik its Beethoven moonlight sonata but what cover? What version?
Now we'll never get Happy Gilmore 2.  Adam Sandler as an older, wiser Happy, mentoring some new golfer. BUT we'll never see it because dude's a serious actor now.
Worst. Movie. Ever.
Good reminder that Adam Sandler can act when the script isn’t terrible
Oh hanush yeah hanush.. thts all about this movie and tht guy being a spaceman always keeps on dreaming like seriously high on weed all the time..
Never thought I'd cry over a spider so much
I fell asleep, this was incredible boring
This movie was a masterpiece
boring horseshit
*SPACE NOPE* _Starring Adam Sandler!_
OH MY GOD what is that! giant ''friendly'' spider?? i dont care how friendly it is GET OUT pls and thank you!
A cheap knock off interstellar 😂
This is proof that Adam Sandler can actually act! Not just shitty comedy movies but also in drama
what a complete piece of sh..it! want back my 20 minutes of my life
So good🙌
Worst movie ever! Adam is a terrible actor
What a movie 👏🏻
BRILLIANT....ADAM SANDLER!!!!
Откуда появился корабль в конце? За ним по следам летел второй корабль? Или так как он не отвечал, послали второй корабль? Если послали почему Ленка до сих пор беременна?
"That's not Greta, Tom..... LOOK AT HER !!!"
oh just wear real pants, ya wild animal. ffs...
This was a great movie. One of my favorites now. I am not going to lie I shed a couple of tears. The movie had philosophical and emotional sense.
what a waste of time it was for me and the whole movie crew
Absalotletly waste of time. I dozed off in between the movie thanks to the background music. If u wanna get a good sleep this is the movie
der langweiligster Film, den ich je gesehen habe.
This movie is actually very good, really makes him let go of all his material and ego driven desires to love and enjoy what matters most, as Jakub did for lenka through Hanus. Warning the ending is sad 😭 never thought I'd tear up for a space spider, but you grow to like Hanus and not fear him, yeah he looks like a spider but he's a hyper intelligent being, who can literally fly through space
The movie is very good and when the spider appears, the story becomes attractive to viewers
Sadly, the film is very boring and slow... Skinny humans
The mans lost his marbles.
The movie I needed to see at this point in my life. Funny how things work sometimes.  10/10 brilliant movie
Worst movie ever hands down …..
Anyone who actually understands what adult science fiction is will love this film.  The critics missed the point.  I had no patience for Sandler's comedy, absolutely never a fan.  But he is a consummate and gifted dramatic actor.   This flick has all the elements of great, classic, sci-fi, which as anyone who truly understands the genre, the stories are always about us; we silly humans.  A truly great movie.  This is not Star Wars.
This movie got me. I retired after 21 years in the military and have deployed or left for duty many times despite obligations at home.  I'm now divorced from a wife who mothered my children that I loved more than anyone.  I will probably die alone  but  I hope this movie gives me a nudge.
One off the most pretentious and disappointing films I've ever seen.
spaceman is such a dumb movie.  he was only gone for 6 months and both adam sandler and wife are selfish idiots. so the entire time they didn't know wtf they were planning for and now their emo trip is jeopardizing human advancement.  what dumb movie
😭❤️
I don't usually cry over sad movie's but this one got me pretty hard not to...
Who need to watch the Full of this movie for free,direct link?
This was a good one it made think so much
Why the hell would we send an astronaut alone for such a ridiculously long voyage? Whether it's an alien or psychological breakdown from prolonged isolation, why send only one.
This movie is trully beautiful and I totally didn't expect to cry as much as I did. I didn't think I would take this movie seriously but here I am calling it masterpiece. It's genuinely one of my favourite movies.
I'm about halfway through the movie and so far it's been really good. It kind of reminds me of Interstellar, the music and overall feeling is similar but without all the extra costly production involved. Adam Sandler shines in this role.  One thing that is annoying me though is that spider still hasn't stopped calling him "Skinny Human". By now they should be on a first name basis don't ya think? LOL
so is the spider bad or good?

It’s so cool to have mention of my country in a movie that’s foreign
Movie is ass dont watch
Sandler is an absolute legend. No matter what he does, he’s always fantastic
Kid: "Mom, we need a friendly neighborhood spiderman." Mom: "But son, we already have one friendly neighborhood spiderman at home." That friendly neighborhood spiderman at home.
only time i wasn’t disgusted by a spider
Существовал ли паук на самом деле? Или это галлюцинации на основе долгого количество времени проведённого в космосе?
I watched the film after a short on YouTube about the meeting of Jacob and Hanush. I was confused by the low ratings on IMDB, so I started watching the film without high expectations.  How wrong I was... The film captivated me so much that I cried for the last quarter of the film. This film is a real cleansing of the soul. Bravo to the director and actors.
Eurospace program  yeah sci fi concept
I’m going to admit I AM BUMMED IT WAS A MOVIE ABOUT HIS BROKEN ASS RELATIONSHIP. Hanooosh was the best character and their breakup scene was good.  I felt Adam sandler had more of a connection with hanoosh than his own wife. 🎉🎉🎉
Just finished it. Absolutely wonderful movie. I found myself putting myself there with him or as him many times. Loved it
Перед просмотром фильма специально прочитал книгу. И оооо ужас, какое было у меня разочарование, что из книги взяли только самый скучный сюжет. Ведь в космсе он уже осмысливал свои отношения с отцом, который погим вместе с матерью, с жертвой отца, которого отец при ссср пытал током, отношение с дедушкой и бабушкой, отношения с женой которая не могла забеременить и так и не смогла. Целый пласт истории просто выкинули, а возврат на землю с русскими на их корабле. В общем скажу так рекомендую прочитать книгу и посмотреть трейлер к фильму. А смотреть лучше Задача трех тел, но перед этим прочесть трилогию, потому что это ВАУ и книга и 1й сезон 2024г.
The book was epic and this looks pretty good too 😝
I’m not the most qualified reviewer but damn this was beautiful.
Just had him on my cab today in London
If you haven't seen it yet, you will NOT be disappointed. 10/10.
Trailer spundtrack?
wow just watched this movie.  👍
ОЧЕНЬ МОЩНОЕ КИНО
A fat old man floating in space 😂
Man goes.. but woman sad.. Can you write something new for once?
Skinny human
Just watched it. Amazing film! Would highly recommend watching
Adam Sandler was absolutely amazing in this.
🥱🤐🥱🥱🤐🥱😴😴😴😴
What a load of shit 😂
Anyone else getting the "astronaut in the ocean" song playing in their head when they watched this😢
This movie should have been called "space shrink"
Such a shame that a nice scify story got wasted for this bs
Why does it always have to be a space spider that plays mind games? It was the same in love-death-robots season 1
Hanus' 😭🍫
Great movie!!!
The waterboy as a astronaut?? Just cant buy it🤣🤣🤣🤣
Adam Sandler is an actor that makes meh movies then every once in a while he takes a role that proves he's an amazing acting.
Ive heard a lot of mixed reviews about this but god damn ita intriguing
Улюблений актор.Слава Україні!
I wanted to like this movie. It’s an intriguing premise, and I bet the book it's based on is an amazing read. But Adam Sandler is not the right actor for the lead character in this movie. He doesn’t quite pull it off. They needed an actor with a lot more acting chops to make it work. Disappointing. Carey Mulligan and Paul Dano, on the other hand, are fantastic. I love movies set in space, and the film looks beautiful, but it’s a real missed opportunity with a bad casting choice.
Jewish in space
when the spider came out and said  "YOOOOU CAN DO IT!" I lost my shit hahaha
Wow and it is not funny!
Love Adam Sandler but movie looks like poop
At the moment you see a giant spider saying don't be afraid, run.
I can solve this entire movie in five easy steps, it's ⬆️➡️⬇️⬇️⬇️
"I just want to come home" ✊🏽
It was really good.
This movie is not good. the 2hrs took up enough time in my life. So, short review. boo.
Why the hell does anyone want to go to « outer space «  to be lonely wtf
Space garbage.
This is a good movie, especially for a "sci-fi" one.
'Are you doing well skinny human' Man I need an emotional support spider too
Lame
never  in my life would i imagine adam sandler would start ina sci- fi thriller
Good movie
Skinny Human
Самый худший фильм на свете ни о чём корабль из фанеры и ДСП - это вообще что-то Сэндлер попал на необитаемый остров и там сняли фильм из г**** и палок
Посмотрел, Шикарный Фильм. Единственный Фильм где Пришелец Паук давит на Эмоции и ценности Семьи.
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
It’s that a giant spider? Nope
I don’t understand Adam Sandler. He has made some of the most excruciatingly, embarrassing, horrible movies ever released. And then he turns around and makes really great movies, like the most recent one where he played the role of the assistant coach for the basketball team, and he goes over to the Balkans and recruits, the big tall guy to come to America and play basketball professionally? That was a truly great movie. Well acted great plot with good character development, and so forth. I love that movie, even though I can’t remember the name of it! But then he makes these absolutely idiotic movies That are literally unwatchable. This movie, spaceman falls somewhere on halfway between 5 and 10 five is watchable and 10 is really great. if the basketball movie is rated at 10, I would say this movie called spaceman would be around 7 to 8. It’s such a bizarre concept, and it very weird. But it’s also got a lot of redeeming factors to it and so it would definitely be worth your while to watch it. I just don’t understand how someone can make really great movies and then turn around and make just the worst movies that have ever been released!
Idk.. I just can't take him seriously.. probably better if just stayed Zohan😂
This movie is essentially Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir. The Spaceman (novel) was written before PHM but the plot is almost identical. 🤔
Spooder
Brutal. The older he gets the more he looks just like every 2,000 year old painting of a blood libel "jewish" rabbi that drinks Christian blood. You put the old 2,000 year old robes on him or the funny hats and it would be identical to artist protrayals from the time of Jesus.
Absolutely brilliant film. One that stays with you for a while after, and really makes you think. Now where can I get one of those Spiders
Looks good I'm about to watch it right now
Очередная шляпа от нетфликс
A movie about the fragility of women with emotional turmoil and the damage they will inflict on those around them regardless of circumstance.
One of the most interesting and heart poking space films in recent years. Adam Sandler is so underrated in dramatic roles and Hanus had such a development of character that by the end… you’re heartbroken for a space spider. Good stuff Netflix.
Как будто говном в лицо кинули в конце. Пошли вы в ж...пу диснею, нетфликс х....етфликс, в от вас я и бал
Long drawn out boring film. Zero action what so ever. Zero anything exciting. Adam Sandler's acting was bad. He was trying to do this accent and it didn't work. At times he just completely abandoned it. The ending was predictable. I didn't cry once i had zero emotional connection to any of the characters. The CGI was... Not bad actually. Some shots looked pretty cool. If i were to ever watch this shit again id have to take a couple hits of acid or something. 1/10
This makes me think of the flying spider thing that’s been spotted in our skies. I swear Netflix has secret knowledge that they are constantly exposing.
I... I feel bad... for the spider? I cried bro... the spider was made into a friend, character development was great... :(
THIS MOVIE WAS SOOO BORING IM GLAD I WATCHED IT ON PIRACY... FELL ASLEEP AT TIMES WATCHING IT... JUNK 👎
Just seen the whole movie in the trailer
so unrealistic
This reminds me of Project Hail Mary
I keep seeing snippets on IG and it reminds me of some really dark humor when I was in the military 😂😂😂😂
Dang it!!! Why it has to be March first!!!! I don’t wanna renew this Netflix account that soon 😤 but I guess if we get to see it soon.
Ughhhhhhhh on second thought,…. While watching this video…. I don’t think I should be HIGH AF because it’s speaking to meeeeee
I’m sooo gonna renew my Netflix just to support my BOY!!! But who use Netflix anymore.
This was a total 💩 show
What's the name of the soundtrack playing in this trailer at 1:05?
Watched it, it was epic! didn't expect to watch an alien movie to be like this🏕️🍳 so good lololol
This looks…bad
RIP Hanus movie was amazing give you loved one a hug.
I like Adam Sandler but this movie was stupid the alien looks like a spider
Just watch the movie 😢 its an amazing movie ❤ Adam sandler did an amazing job 👏  Great plot, great twist, amazingly beautiful 👏 🤩 Go watch it "skiny humans "😂
Just saw the movie. Really strange movie, but as a whole really good. Can highly recomend it :)
It good to see Adam Sandler play in a movie where he not playing as a  funny guy if an actor or actress only plays in funny movies  would they would only be known as a funny person people would wonder if they could do a serious role where they do not have to be funny
Does anyone know the song in the first half of the trailer?
I did not enjoy this movie at all
As someone with arachnophobia seeing this pop up on Netflix between movies had my skin literally crawling but I'm gonna have to give it a try for the water boy😭
Unbelievably bad...
How the fk has this man not aged in like 20 years?
Spider?  Maybe something more of a imaginary possibility might have been better, but the movie looks great! Sandler is good whatever he's in.
Can't believe some critics are panning this movie..they dont get it..one of the greatest movies I've seen.
another solo mission sci-fi likened to films like Ad Astra, Moon, Gravity, etc, great movie, still thinking about it since watching it, unique in its presentation.
Yo can someone please name this song please 1:03
I didn't know anything about this movie, so when I first saw Hanus, I was like WhaaaaaaT!!!111 😮
Good one. stay u
Screw rotten tomatoes, this movie was great!
Explain this in Kanye terms
Jus finished the book this movie is based on and I gotta say, it is profoundly boring. Halfway into the book it turns into a lifetime channel soap opera drama. The first half was kinda good tho but the rest is just...is this over yet??
Want to watch
I just finished this movie with zero context- never even saw this trailer. Just saw Adam Sandler and a space spider and was down to try it. I was not expecting to be SOBBING at the end of it. Good movie!
Giant spiders are my fetishes. I’m soooo rn
What's up, skinny humans?
Great movie.  Adam Sandler was amazing 👏 🎉
Song pls
Sandler is really good in drama. Better than comedy last 10 years.
Song name anyone?
I’m watching ts rn
👍🏾👌🏾👍🏾Good Luck with this one Adam❤❤!!
It's not humanly possible anymore to make good movies about real life events and things that can actually happen.
The sequel to Punch Drunk Love we didn’t know we needed
Never would I have tought I'd cry in a movie containing Adam Sandler and a Giant space spider, fantastic movie.
Somehow I like this movie, lasts a bit too long… but Sandler and “Hanuš” are brilliant 😂
Absolutely loved this film!
I'm not doubt his acting, but I'm afraid i will bore with the plot like Ad astra.
Not sure why the rating is so average. Just finished the movie. It was a glorious trip
Terrific movie! Bravo!  It was beautifull. Without spoilers, just go for it! Trust me. Deff a watch!❤
Lockdown in Space. This looks like a real covid-19 movie. 😐
Solaris lite
I love seeing Adam Sandler after a long time in a movie <3
Worst movie ever 💔💔💔💔
Adam Sandler is going for an Oscar!?🤔
Goodbye....skinny human
I was going to pirate this, but then I watched the trailer and decided it wasn't worth the time.
‼HIGHLY RECOMMENDED‼ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ If you are familiar with Jordan Peterson style philosophy and his articulate ideas on life lessons, you will love this movie and the abstraction behind almost every nuance of this film. Iykyk.  Incorporated self consciousness, analysis of the past, foundations of life, emotions, relationships, awareness, acceptance, personal self-discovery, faith, a courageous journey into the unknown, and topped off with what seems like a blackhole journey with concepts of string theory and space time similar to Interstellar. Wonderfully done storytelling! 💯👏👍
A twist on Spider-Man 3 where Spidey and Sandman become besties 😎
Very good soundtrack. And the voice of Hanus. The visuals. Such a soothing movie. Will definitely watch again
Just watched this.  One of the finest movies out there.
I love the spider it was the best parts of the movie
MAN SHAGS SPACE SPIDER XXX 😂
This actually looks very good ima have to check it out
If you have a storywriter who did not manage to have a successful couples therapy, something like this is the result. I think this film is a BS pseudo-philosophy movie, but I would also say that some people might really like it.
without having watched it yet i wonder if it is based on the black mirror episode where they get caught, after long travel and hibernation, in a cosmic spiders web and a giant spider which keeps the survivor basically hallucinating so it does not realize the horror of where it is
15/10 absolutely exhilarating I enjoyed it so much the story and interactions are wonderful
We all saw a tragically beautiful side of Adam. I could watch this over and over again. Power move!❤❤
I didn't like it. The main plot is the maritial problems of the astronaut. They just threw into the plot a giant talking alien spider and a mysterious purple space dust cloud. The ending felt rushed. I wasn't satisfied. I'd give it a 3.5/10.
tf you mean 5.8 ? maybe it's because I relate enormously to the love story and also to the relationship with Hanus but damn I didn't cry in months before this movie
Donnie darko AHH spider alien
It is so bad that I couldn't watch the entire movie. Even if you are an eager Adam Sandler fan the drama role that he has talking to that spider is a cliche.
Was an interesting movie. Boring in many parts. I usually forget most movies after I leave the theatre. Thought about this one a bit in the last week
Masterpiece.
Its the worst movie he has done and the worst movie. Who’s dumb idea was it to have a giant talking spider that just appeared on the spaceship…this movie could have been awesome but they ruined another one once again. Not to many good movies since Covid-19
Has anyone seen moon?
All netflix shows look alike. They all have the same tempo. Same style. Same look.
This was a great movie. Love Adam Sandler in any role . He can do anything. I miss his old comedy style roles but this was an amazing movie and he played it perfectly.
That spider had potential, but then you gave him that voice. Poor choice skinny human.
AWFUL FILM
A real astronaut would put the future of his or her species first. This character never would’ve gotten this position in real life. He’s an emotionally dependent whiner, like the whiners in the Alone series who never last. Strong people can make it on their own, and space exploration carries the importance that justifies such strength. Furthermore, it’s naive to think they’d send only one astronaut on such a mission.
Szkoda mi tego pająka z powodu tego co stało się z nim na końcu
Whoever wrote this doesn’t know science very well. Unless they thought quantum entanglement can somehow justify it, which it really can’t, there can’t be a faster than light speed telephone. This movie isn’t badly made, but this whole love conquers all crap being applied to sci fi movies like this is getting kind of old. We’ve seen it enough already. The truth is we need to explore space for a possible future home. It’s about survival. Love has nothing to do with it, (unless it’s love for humanity, and life in general).
Lucas the spider, all grown up and in space
Why you gotta make it so boring, it could of been a pretty decent film but too boring sorry
10/10
Die Psychologische aufarbeitung eines lebes die so hätte bei einem Psychologen oder während eines pilztrips hätte stattfinden können … Adam Sandler spielt seinen part wirklich meisterhaft…
Hello Skinny Human Hello Stupid Film 🎥  And Hello Space Spider with incredibly Annoying Voice , turned it off after 30 minutes 👍 Aload of Rubbish 🗑
This film is like Melancholia, but good. Sandler reaches Sam Rockwell's heights
I hate spiders but when Hanus died, it really got me in my feels.
The film is poignant, beautiful and thought provoking. One of the highlights for me was the soundtrack.
This shit blows, we want grown ups 3
It was really good to see Adam Sandler in a serious role. Which movie fans should see to reset their heads about him. Bcz he  knocked it out of the park in this. Such a turn around in my previous thoughts about his acting abilities. Can't believe the low ratings by IMDB and R Tomatoes. Doesn't deserve these low scores. "Both main characters" keep you going..
I can already tell im gonna bawl like a baby. Adam sandler is so talented. Hes gonna break us
I wish I knew you Adam as a friend my whole life.
O:46 180 days buddy try 52 months isolation!
This was a very emotional movie 😭 I couldn’t avoid crying in the last minutes. I was hesitating to watch it but it was worth the time
Name of the songs of the trailer?
This movie is comically bad.  My wife walked in the room and asked me what hell is talking to?  Is that a spider in space?  I was really embarrassed.  So bad but I still love Sandler in real movies.
someone's been reading Hail Mary heh :)
most stupid movie i have seen in last 3 years. very bad lol
That was a really good story.
I hate mind fukk movies ! 😂
Andy Weir liberation project?
another poo show
Adam Sandler. One of the tribe members.  Tribe members= narcissism, nepotism.  This movie was full of his narcissism.
This is the most beautiful and touching movie I've ever seen
I can’t understand any bad reviews. This is the best film I’ve seen in a while. I wonder if the NYtimes writer who called this film a “misfire” lacks emotional depth and could benefit from some time with the spider therapist 😂
This movie will probably be very good, but… spiders, giant space spiders… why? Why did it have to be giant space spiders? It could have been anything and you chose giant space spiders. Space jelly fish or space octopi would have been so much better, and frankly would make a whole lot more sense than spiders.
This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever watched in my life
I like this version of Laracna better.
Gf gets pregnant & asks astronaut bf to leave a mission to be with her or she'll leave. Note: Don't let women ruin you.
Brilliant film
Theres been a significant drop in quality of movies the past 15years - This unfortunately, does not change the trend, even though Sandler is great.
Boring turned it off 😴
hanuş :(
@1:04 -- what is that version of Pachelbel's Canon in D? I'd love to find it.
welll another waste of time movie, nice
Hello Skinny Humans
This was probably the most terrifying non horror movie I’ve ever watched! It’s good though
yikes, a movie where adam sandler is in deep space could have been great, but instead they focused on a weird romantic storyline with some dumba$$ spider
Am i the only one who thought he was about to clap alien cheeks.
Why does every space scifi movie have to be so boring and talkative, without action?
“LONG LIVE HANUŠ” 🫶🏾😩
Song name?
Adam carries so much sadness, you can see it in his eyes.....
Spacejew only on Netflix 🎉
I like Adam Sandler but I must say this was very boring movie. I’d give it 2/5. Waste of time.
I just finished this movie 20 minutes 2 cigarettes and a dab ago and I’m still crying. I ordered the book on the spot. Adam Sandler outdid himself
So bad
It's time for ADAM SANDLER to meet the real Spaceman! A video clip of ACE FREHLEY with ADAM SANDLER hanging out together would be GENIUS🎉🎉🎉 ACE could come Visit ADAM. They could chop it up. I'm sure some laughs would insu 😂😅  C'mon HOLLYWOOD....THIS IS FREE ADVERTISING AT IT FINEST. So sayith The KISS ARMY KNIGHT 🛡️ Rock and Roll over and out 🪨 N 🥐
As someone going through a spiritual awakening this movie meant so much to me. The bond between Hanus and Jakub was beautiful. Great movie.
This movie sucked 😂.
Watch this last night off a torrent. Holy crap it was insane…. Like wtf
Imagine watching this off shrooms. Next level.
The worst movie I’ve ever watched
I've really enjoyed this movie. I feel emotionally touched in the good way. I don't know if from a filmmaker point of view is good or bad, but the plot, the dialogues, the atmosphere, the philosophical and psychological meanings during the movie are excellent.
Watched it last night while off a nice mushroom 🍄 vibe. It had me locked in and caught me off guard of how much it resonated with me. Will watch again to see if it carries the same weight. Skinny human lol
Giant spider in your room,  hilarious... don´t make me come there.
A new sci-fi movie... yeaaaaa With Adam Sandler... noooooo
So... a Space Program sent to space and alone a mental patient who had married a mental and selfish wife.
I really don’t like it. Maybe Sanders try to do his best but plot is terrible. I love sci-fi movies, but this was a terrible nightmare
Thank you for this movie ❤

Good movie worth the watch. Very similar to Love Angels and Airwaves 2011 and Moon 2008.
Yep, next movie could be "anthropophobia" where thousands of nasty humans invade a quite spider nest. Why not after all ?
Watched it. Pretty mixed feelings about it. It is well acted, but can't decide on the ending? Never thought I'd feel sad for a Space Spider.
Adam sandler is perfect for roles like these
The movie has great ideas, and I liked it, but I feel like there are some parts that aren't fleshed out well.
Very modest of the spider to not ask for credits
Does anyone the song they used for this trailer? It's not on the soundtrack on Spotify and it's driving me mad! 🙈
Sorry but it's one of the most dumbest movies I've ever watched some people will say it was soo good but watch it for yourselves
This movie made me cry twice
Is it worth watching??
Somehow Adam Sandler playing the lead makes me not believing in this movie. I just don't see him doing this role well. I think I am going to skip this one.
There was zero delay during the video call?
OK but why a spider????
The biggest moron attempting to be serious .
Did they need to keep the names as in the book? I find it odd.  Anyway, for perspective, I recommend Ikarie XB1, a czechoslovak sci-fi (psych/thriller?) that avoided the futuristic/mythic trends of the time...
Why would there be a weird massive spider floating around in space lol
Hanuş is sigma...
Dumb as hell movie.
Ayooo what is aragog doing in space 💀
Why does the alien have to be a damn spider?! 😭
Adam Sandler should do more of these kind of movies. Also 50 First dates is one of my all time favourites.
First time crying like a baby over a space spider. RIP Hanus😪
The fact that Adam Sandler is a beautiful human being and he makes movies like this is a gasp of fresh air into hollywood. Thank you Adam.
Trailer music is some Kind of edit of Nocturne Num. 20 by Fores. His original video on his channel has only 200 views.   Let’s change that shall we?
Movie sucked
that spider metaphor really deem praise because most of the time we afraid to acknowledge that not every scaring thing s are bad. It just how we interpret thing.
This movie was complete 💩
I am sure i am one of the few. I didn’t like it, kept falling asleep, and it made no sense. Much like bullocks space movie.  Adam can do wayyyyy more better movies! But i think he just stopped trying to.
Did it really have to be a giant ass spider?
the spiders voice is soothing
What a powerful movie, what a marvelous experience. Sandler is impecable on this one, he's acting range became wider once again.  Bravo!
Don’t waste your time ….
Just watched it. I like Adam Sandler but this movie is awfully slow and boring. Don't waste your time on this even you're a fan of Sandler.
Reminds me of Moon with Sam Rockwell.
Drama ... I'll pass.
I got broken up with by a guy just like him and this movie had me in absolute shambles
What’s this song?
Boring
nice to see a movie with a bit of depth not to mention one wrapped up in such stunning visuals.. I watched and re-watched parts again. The overall message is beautiful. Full of subtle metaphors that one doesn't have to get exactly to still be moved. Bravo to Adam Sandler for taking this on. It required careful handling and he pulled it off. I loved it. (And not just because my name is Lenka ;)).
I have a phobia of spiders but that is one chill spider
Half of the comments here are faked and  prewritten by bots!
Movie was not good
Great film, reminded me of Donnie Darko
Thank you, Hanûs.
Wow. I’ve just watched this, I’m in tears, im in awe & I think this films going to stay with me for a while. Thank you
Odly satisfying masterpice. Got me glued for 90 min. Very calm and soothing for the brain after scrolling trough tiktok, insta and shorts mindlessly
Looks boaring
I loved it. All of it. The spider is only known to a certain group of us.
Just saw the movie. It was beautiful
Giant spider in space.Turn off.
Cerita apa slow nak mampus..5 kali terlena tgk crita ni
I thought it was adaptation of ""Project Hail Mary" at first.
What is the version of Moonlight Sonata used in this trailer?
Is chutiye se bhi chutiye movie ko kabhi mat dekhna isse chutiya movie maine Aaj Tak nahi dekha hai chiii thooo Mera time waste ho gaya thooo
this was an amazing movie!
This film you have to watch!. It literally gives you a natural high. And its trippy AF
The moment when Sandler's character says "I don't need your help" and the spider replies "But you do." was a touching and powerful moment in this movie. 8/10 definitely recommend.
HOSTELERS: I just wanna go home....
Giant spider in space....nope I ain't watching that, I freak out over little ones in the bathroom.
how many thousands of these positive comments are a.i ? fcuk all this
God this movie was shit!
since nasa fakes everything this is believable
I was so interested in watching this until the protagonist ends up being a giant freaking spider😅
There is definitely people that connect with the movie and follow the lesson of self awareness and preventing yourself from departing from others, I really loved that about the movie and how memories and actions can’t be rewinded, the visuals were also very stunning. Honestly my preference in this movie would be a solid 9.8/10 (I really hated the alien design tbh). I have a bit of arachnophobia which it didn’t really help much watching this movie but solid movie tbh for it being a sci-fi movie which I usually watch horror. Great acting by Adam Sandler honestly. (I rated this movie based on other sci-fi movies I’ve seen in the past. I barely watch sci-fi but this one did hit different Fr).
This movie is not for everyone they  say it was a snooze fest but thats the point, it delivers the feeling and emotion of being "Alone" in Space its not your typical sci-fi starwars shts.
Isn't this just Click?
Great, just great, two things I hate. Space, and spiders, but not just any spiders. Giant space spiders. Who apparently can breath in space. Also, has telepathic communication.
Horrible
Also mine
Billy and Jeff the Spider lol
WOULDN'T IT BE AMAZING IF ADAM SANDLER FINALLY WINS ACADEMY AWARD FOR HIS BRILLIANT ACTING IN THIS MOVIE AND I HOPE THAT EVEN IF HE DOESN'T WIN ACADEMY AWARD FOR THIS MOVIE. I REALLY HOPE THAT HE WILL BE A NOMINATED FOR ACADEMY AWARD. ADAM SANDLER IS ONE OF THE BEST COMEDIANS AND HE'S ONE OF A KIND HUMAN BEING MEANING HE'S ALWAYS HIMSELF AND HE DOESN'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT THE WAY HE DRESSES WITH THE BABY SHORTS UP AND ONE WITH A LONG T-SHIRT. PS ALWAYS REMEMBER TO LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF NO MATTER WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR THAT PERSON MORE VALUABLE THAN US. BECAUSE LOVE AND FORGIVENESS IS ONE OF THE POWERFUL THINGS THAT GOD CAN GIVE US THROUGH CHRIST JESUS MY LORD AND SAVIOR....✍️✝️🇺🇸❤️ PSALMS 119:105
Movie was a waste of time.
I've just finished watching this movie and I really liked it.
Why do aliens always speak english .
Boring very boring so boring I wish I could rewind time lmao 🤣
I hear a lot of, "It was boring" for a lot of movies that I like.. This movie, however, is in a league of its own and is a total boring snooze fest. The pacing and dialog delivery will put you to sleep. If you're burned out on ASMR to help you sleep, just put this movie on.   Movie score: 1/5  Sleep aid score: 5/5
Worst movie ever made, the end.
I love this movie, it is the best. The pig flying throughout the spaceship and a space tarantula is being a psychotherapist ... and poignant, creepy and therapeutical voice of Paul Dano ... I am in love ❤
adam sendler is spiderman spidersendler
this film is the best of 2024 for me
In my opinion, this is the best Adam Sandler movie!
holy crap this movie was BAAAAD.....I just watched it....dont waste your time...
This movie was enjoyable and so different than the offerings out. It wasn't what I expected and now I want to read the book. Did Hanus even exist??? Please no more remakes. This was fantastic
Why is nobody talking about the fact that there’s a Czech space agency with American accents and enough funding to send a man on a 9 month journey through space to collect particles from a space cloud? Wtf is this movie? It wouldn’t have been very hard to just use NASA or SpaceX. Why use Czech?
A drama
Amazing movie. 💯
He goes to space and starts loosing his mind. Terribly slow. Awful at pulling the viewer in. No action and Litteraly put me to sleep. 😴
HELP what song is played at 1:03!?
what a boring crapass story...
Regardless of shitty reviews. I give this movie 9/10. Top 10 movies for sure. What a journey. Love it! Adam, great acting
Right, you really need to start crediting the music you use!
One of the worst movies I have ever seen
the wife is such a horrible person
I love
☢☢⛔⛔DO NOT WASTE YOUR ELECTRICTY ON THIS AWFUL FILM. ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS.⛔⛔☢☢
Worst movie to ever exist its not funny and dumb af plz dont waste 2 hours of ur life warching thos garbage
Movies- great Euro space program Reality- shiity expansive useless euro space prog
Didn't like it. It was really bad. Prolly his all-time worst film yet. Adam did the worst attempted accent I ever heard. It's as if he practiced doing it in the shower for 5 minutes before making the film then there are moments when he seems to forget that he is supposed to be doing an accent but instead he speaks normal but stops using contractions. I give it a 1 out of 10. I would rather poke my eyes out with a sharp stick than watch this film again. I have seen better film on my teeth than this piece of crap. Sorry Adam. I call em like I see em.
This movie turned out to be a lot better than I expected
I love Adam Sandler. Surprised years back at how much I loved his dramas and always root for him. With that said, this isn’t it. Sandler doesn’t disappoint and does what he can…. But a talking spider is the supporting actor. Awful.
Ya f@cker 😳 WOW!  Canny wait for this yin y’all 🤘🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🤘
Ooooooo I'm Adam Sandleer, and this is Spider from Mars.
The only okay thing Adam Sandler did was hotel transelvania. Eventhought that was a bit weird.
Why does it has to be a spider?  Man this is gonna be worse than a horror movie for me.
I'd say something but youtube would delete me
Love (2011)
I can’t lie this movie was disappointing. Had high hopes being that Adam Sandler was the star. I give the movie 1/5 should’ve never released
interstellar but instead of TARS he has Hanush. literally, still loved it though
What’s the song called in the background of the trailer?
Director: 'I would like to be paid in cocaine.'
Not me getting emotional and hearing "skinny human" every time I see a spider now 😭
So far. The BIGGEST CRAP 2024. Totally WASTE OF TIME. Turned off after 20min.
Its so weird to see people hating hard on a film and im here crying and laughing and enjoying the best movie of 2024 so far.
Movie sucked would love to see him in a horror alien film or something like that I love Adam Sandler
The Eeriness and the feeling of the deep cosmic void really makes me feel a certain type of way I can’t describe these types of movies puts me to think of how big the universe is and it makes me depressed knowing that we don’t know much but at the same type this movie have 110% of my attention I give it a 11/10 the acting the voice dialog and the story telling was immaculate. This might be my new favorite movie to bad it was so short I feel.
Worst movie I hv ever seen
The sandman playing another Oscar award winning role but there is a giant ass spider? ( I do not like spiders) I think it’s time to get over my fear
It's a very bad movie. I got bored watching it and deleted it after watching half of it.
A spiritual movie.
This movie is like being on ketamine
What a totally crap film.. sorry, not my cup of tea.. had to turn off after 1/2h
This is literally the plot of an episode of love death and robots.
Such a good movie, definitely not for people who can’t sit still for more than  5 minutes
I really wanted to like this movie, and now I'm disappointed and mad at myself for watching the whole thing, because I only give it a 2 out of 10.  Basically it SUCKED.  You have been warned.
Hanus is a bro 👍🏻
Adam Sandler nice
It isn't adam sandler and his friends kinda movie?
What an unbelievably shit movie.
Adam Sandlers worst movie.
Who else feels they seen this movie as kid?? Mandela effect???
Adam Sandler is one of my all-time faves I'm glad to see him in this its something different. I'm excited to watch it❤❤❤
Aragog finally getting work again
Hanoush died from Nutella poisoning
This was such a beautiful movie. 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Adam sandler is doing anything to make his movie quota with netflix bringing b grade movie after b grade movie out he's movies were great once now there just barely Watchable
This actually looks pretty damn good.
Hi
Tried to explain it to someone after watching it made me wonder if I hallucinated the whole thing.
I need this moonlight sonata version
I don’t know if this movie worsened or lessened my arachnophobia
That most of been some great Nutella.. if you know, you know. Pretty crazy movie
Clumsy and awkward writing. The dialog as well.
Everyone saying “this movie sucked” or “this movie was boring” didn’t take the time to understand.   I’m glad I watched this movie.
Why does the alien look like a spider
What a masterpiece movie. Adam Sandler is just too good on drama movies. I will probably re-watch it few times.
WTF Just wasted by time watching this crap
This looks really good.
Reminds me of Ad Astra. In both movies the characters suffer from self-inflicted loneliness, they choose that because it is safer there (emotionally speaking) but they also suffer. They don't really want to be alone. Both characters evolve in their stories. They decide to open up to emotions. They connect to their partners and they give up on fear. Fear of being hurt emotionally. They are lucky to get another chance.  I actually feel very identified with them, I know I need to connect to my partner and open up, but the fear is intense.
Happened to watch this newly pregnant with my mom tonight. Going through a very eerily similar situation such as Lenka. She hit the nail on the head during her dialogues and especially during the “do you ever feel like you might evaporate” conversation with her mom. Beautiful film.   I hope it receives the recognition. Xx
I like Adam and I he can pull of a dramatic roll, but this trailer leaves much to be desired.
Hagrid would have been proud.
This movie is a dumbed down remake of the 1965 masterpiece "2001: A Space Odyssey"; don't waste your time and watch this one instead. In Spaceman, instead of a ship AI that sabotages/eliminates anything, or anyone that presents a threat to whatever it prioritizes; it is a giant, talking spider. The ending is also the same; except in the case of Space Odyssey, instead of just blatantly saying what is found, it is displayed in a far more fascinating metaphor. What a giant waste of talent for Adam Sandler; he must have been desperate for a quick cash grab.
Jesus! That's 1.48 minutes il never get back. Massive pile of crap
Wow wat a great movie I grew up on Funny comedy of Adam Sandler seeing him in a serious movie I was skeptical but man his acting in this movie is dope af love this movie very confused by the ending tho cuz Science
My god...this was actually such a beautiful film
This was both an incredibly deep and ambient set film with so many thoughts and feelings. But I gotta say the spider gave me the hibby jibbies 😭😭😭
Thought this was gonna be a comedy
He’s not that skinny.
2/10
It's a deep movie.  It's a art film
I loved the movie! 👌
This movie hit pretty hard
This was surprisingly brilliant,anyone who's reluctant. Do yourself a favour,and watch it. Really makes you think about how insignificant our problems are,in the grand scheme of things....🤔❤️ 10 out 10
I had an experience like this after I ate some half-rotten rye bread one time. This was definitely the funniest role Adam Sandler has ever played. A Czech space mission? Ha ha ha!
💩
هذي مو لغة عربيه ، اللغة العربيه اجمل
Well, there go the people who can't stand spiders :D
Everything is confusing. Fully disliked
spiderman is going to get jelous
Save your time and skip it. I warned you.  Just a long dragged out boring movie
Give Revives With Military Because Space Force Zavhn Quentin thc Is Saving Citizens.
What's going wrong here? Absolutely nothing. Outstanding movie. Adam Sandler is great and enjoyable. Top-notch Sci-Fi story. Loved it! Its Netflix lack of promotion when dis flops.
At the end i had just three words wtf... 😐
So Adam Sandler is on a spaceship with an Australian citizen?
Sorry, but this movie is not that good, it has a few moments but mostly I'm glad I didn't have to pay to watch it
❤ loved it
I really can't understand how this crap movie people trying to convince other people it's amazing.  Seriously this is really worst movie I ever watched like wasted more then an hour of my life . I think it's made to waste your life !  what a fkn shit movie , Adam stick to comedy Man this is just so disappointing.
Worst movie ever made .
Considering he sang Space Oddity in Mr Deeds, Adam has come full circle
Long and boring  movie. Only benefit it was better than uncut gems
Today ,I downloaded this movie and I sees the movie again I will do review:
Finally a decent movie 10/10 🤘
Inc regain the trailer doesn’t convey the mood of the movie at all
Eeehh sci fi is so not my type! Was a struggle to watch for me
And also kindapp punishment changing everything's opposite
absolute shite from start to finish
this is some good shit u guys should watch this
“I didn’t know”  “You never asked”  😢
Vaguely reminds me of Children of Time. I think I’ll read Spaceman of Bohemia next
just saw this movie Give our Boy Adam Sandler 1000 stars and 1000 Grammy and put him at the top remove Barbie BS and put our boy on Top
I have phobia of spiders this is going to be very difficult to watch😅
NGL I hated this movie.
When you've been spoiled by Kubrick & Tarkovsky it's difficult to take anything that may appear less, more seriously. Sandler's Howard Ratner in Uncut Gems was probably his pinnacle. After that it's watered down versions of the same or lateral versions. And here it would seem Solaris gets a new spin too, but unfortunately it's only gravitational forces & zero G. Saying that it all and sounds great or generally good. Where Tarkovsky went poetical & Kubrick technical Spaceman gets lost in space in the middle - and in some communist subplot too, which seems to be neither here nor there. The talking spider eventually becomes annoying with the 'skinny human' routine repeated too often - and Sandler isn't exactly skinny either. The earth bound pregnancy turns a nice philosophy on what's important - yet both points are as well: science & the human race, so it feels aimless. And finally there's something homogenised about films from Netflix - it's as though the same people with the same Netflix remit churn out the same 'feeling' about its product. These endeavours maybe costly but there's no risk - no innovation, it's all one of the same. There's absolutely no room for the auteur. Instead there's a kind of cinematic margarine made to consume on the small screen. Perhaps a better title would have been Lost in Space, Again.' The last excellent space film was probably Duncan Jones's Moon - which somehow utilised the Tarkovsky/Kubrick conundrum with an understated grace & humility.
How'd the spider get there wtf
Hanus😢
He is not meant for drama
"where you go I go"
I finish this movie in 2 days watching parts for the respect of adam sandler. Wow I guess anyone can write movies these days. 0-5 it was a 0 1/2.
Adam is one of the greatest actors alive ****
Adam Is in my top 10 of favorite actors
"I Don't have any wings, on my spaceship...you got a minute"?
Damn this looks great
Silly story. Very. Well, spiders breathe oxygen and he was a spider so .....obviously a figment of his imagination. But who are we siupposed to love in this story? Jakub is a selfish man. So is Lenka a selfish woman. Neither are likeable. TBH  ... I thought it was a stupid movie. A stupid premise. Why did they send onl ONE person? Where is the mission priority? What happens if Jakub is ill/dies? Who sends ONE person on a deep space mission? Also. One year? It takes two years to get to Jupiter... two  years back etc. that's four years of mission just in travelling. His mission was one year? It makes no sense and is a worrying  factor in many streaming stories now. Poor writing. People are writing movies now WHO ARE NOT WRITERS. Writing is an art. Nothing made sense. NEtflix and strewaming services have just shown us how important writers are and how rare they are.
Anybody has a full version of this arrangement of the Moonlight Sonata?
This make me so sleepy 😴 but I'm a loyal Adam Samler fan..😊🙊
Big scary spider that sounds like HAL from 2001 Space Odyssey.
A spider named  hanus ??
Finally a good film. Netflix make more of this and less of cuties you pervets
This reminds me of Project Hail Mary
2024 a space Odyssey
Yall be lying in these comments! This movie was sooooo dumb and a waste of time!!!
It had to be a spider....
Adam Sandler is great in this dramatic sci-fi film. I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed his performance. It's great that he's been showing his breadth as an actor lately with these more dramatic roles- i.e."Uncut Gems" and I personally think he showed us again that not only can he do serious roles, but he can absolutely nail it!  Not gonna lie, at first I was distracted by the kookiness of his spider "costar" , but that disappeared quickly as I became absorbed in the story  and Sandler's performance.  Highly recommend this movie.
Why is that voice so familiar?   AHH  same cadence as Dr. Manhatten
What in the fuckery is this!?
That is a big NO ! TOO MANY LEGS
I'm going to see this movie whilst on acid
Awesome movie.. I just got done watching it.. Adam Sandler is a great actor.. Skinny Human 😅
Completely different tone than I expected. For the better. Vaguely lovecraftian Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind in space. With a possibly real eternal space spider voiced by Paul freaking Deno.
Similar vein to 'Click' but it .. Worked really enjoyed it overall
I loved this movie but I'm a weird skinny human..
I get it but it's sooooooo sloooooow of a movie. They could have cut 1/2 hour out easily.
Looks good but that spider creeps the shit out of me
Wow it's crazy to see Adam Sandler in a serious movie.
Adam Sandler is ....a spaceman  XD
Outstanding film!
Such a great film! The symbolism and the philosophical take of life and existence  is awesome.
I just got done watching this movie. I personally think it's the best movie he has ever done
Is htis going to be Returnal but movie plotwise?
So Solaris, but stupid.
Very good movie! More like this Netflix!!!
Do not watch this film; it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The film is incredibly boring with a poorly developed plot. It's just another Adam Sandler film, and even in a space-themed movie with aliens, he manages to revolve the story around his family (his wife). Despite Adam Sandler delivering some good performances in the past, this ranks among his worst. Nothing about it felt genuine; it was extremely unbelievable, even for a sci-fi genre. The main reason for his isolation in space is not explained at all.  The subplot involving the spider needed much more explanation; it suddenly appears without any backstory, except that it comes from an extinct species. And what's the deal with the purple cloud? Why do they have to fly there? Why go alone? The love story was irritating, with constant references to "I need to get to Lenka, I need to talk to her, what about Lenka." Moreover, the concept seems like a poorly copied version of Interstellar and another alien film, but much worse.  I hope this comment saves some people from watching the movie. I strongly advise against it.
I fell asleep within 20 minutes. Holy smokes! I tried to stay awake but it was so boring.
Is this the Venom prequel movie?
Adam sandler has put out some shit movies this one's high on the list
...just watched Spaceman on Netflix. It's so much more than a SciFi-Movie. And it is a SciFi-Movie like made when i was a kid 50 years ago. I love it. Thank all involved people for makin it that way. And my best regards to Mr. Sandler, (whom i really appreciate in serious acting).
0:54 *I did not intend to frighten you, skinny human.* 😂😂😂
Man my fear of spiders is gonna make this a hard watch but I’ll do it.
Astronaut goes into deep space, meets a telepathic spider, who also happens to be a marriage counselor and through this marriage counselor spider reevaluates his relationship with his whiny wife, who lives a total life of comfort but sits around bitching about her far away husband who cares about being an Astronaut more than her needs.   What are her earthly needs? We never really seem to know. I would have had the spider space creature pull out a notebook and pen and say, ok tell me about your feelings concerning your Father. You said he was somewhat of an asshole, elaborate on that. Yes, yes and how do you feel about that, then the spider writes down "possible father complex"
This movie surprised me ❤ so worth it! I love Sandler in these kinds of roles
Awful movie. Walk out of theater bad. But it is still better than most marvel movies.
Chiquita basura de película,  creo que es lo peor que he visto en bastante tiempo con diferencia.
I’ve been reading peoples thoughts on the spider. But the thing I want to put out is…… why didn’t they have recordings of him talking to himself ?
Who cried ? I know I’m not the only one.
This movie was so deep and good, it has me questioning all of my life choices.
Netflix's quality no longer convinces me☠
Does anyone know the song on this trailer?
Great movie but the ending was complete s*** like there should have been more explanation in the ending of what exactly happened throughout the whole movie lake Damn 😔 like the ending man really could use some changing easily could have had another 30 minutes on to the movie
Wow.......
Love seeing Sandler play more serious roles
Possible spoilers:  Really not sure what this movie is trying to say - other than the usual sci-fi trope of putting the most emotionally distraught astronaut into an extended space mission, hoping he can resolve all his deep personal problems - rather than focusing on something of interest for the audience.  I get it.  We need personal drama in space to give the story a human touch - but this exact same movie could be done if Adam Sandler was on an automated oil rig, or manning an arctic station, of exploring a huge underground cave - all on planet Earth.  The outer space setting adds nothing to the story.  On a positive note - the movie looks good.  Nice sets, well-done zero-g scenes, and some beautiful FX shots - but the story lacks punch for sci-fi fans who were hoping for some fresh ideas.  All that said, Sandler is pretty good in this - and I can't think of anyone doing better with the script they gave him.  Of course, your space mileage may vary.
What a, pice of crap
Inshallah hope to watch this movie someday❤
Jeeeeeeeeeezzz it was boring... I slept like a stone 😂😂😂
Totally waste of time... pointless movie
This movie sucks he needs to stop acting and space is not his thing.
Not sure if it's because I'm 50 and have seen some great films especially in the 90s, but like most new mainstream films this to me was the most boring movie I think I have ever seen. Totally blown away with the  comments from people saying this is amazing
Did have to be a damn spider!? 😰
Blud think he Ryan Gosling
Shit in a bottle here u go  i cant imagine how i watched 1 hr of this shitty bull crap u now when picaso peed on the paper they called it art well .... disclaimer if u are depressed never ever come near this sandler or chandler i rate what i watch its 2/10
Actually such a good movie
"Its not uncommon for men to share a bed in europe"- Dr. Buddy Rydell "Thats why im proud to be an American" -Dave Buznik
Spiders in space...space spiders......no, I'm good. Lol
Biggest twist was Adam NOT having his wife act in this movie. I was SHOCKED
Damn good movie! Beautiful message! I love the fact that just like in interstellar love is the only thing that binds us even when we are far away. Just like quantum entanglement and love is the only things that transcends time and space giving us hope to return to those we love and and doing whatever it takes to get back to those we love even on the brink of death. Now skinny humans everything you want is in front of you.
How come I keep expecting to hear the tune Space Oddity from Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.
Skinny Human
Loved it!!!!!! 🍿
When I first seen a short review of this movie I thought it was going to be a horror lol trapped on a spaceship with a giant alien spider, this movie was wonderful and *Adam Sandler* did a beautiful job :) its a big level up from *Jack & Jill*
Space spider meets interstellar minus matthew.
Sorry i cant watch him in space..too much bro
The premise is stupid. His selfish wife abandons him because he's a highly focused astronaut who has dedicated his life to making a history-changing discovery. We're expected to care more about their petty relationship problems than the magical purple nebula and the eldritch psychic spider.
watched this last night.. believe me when I say, you’re going to need some tissues.. stunning movie from start to finish
"Do not be afraid", and yet you look like a giant  spider. Nope. I'll definitely be exploding the spaceship. Probably planning on laying eggs in my body 🤔😑😑😑
This was the weirdest Adam Sandler movie by far
This movie sucks, I  lost 30 min of my live looking this trash
Can anyone possibly name the song, that's sung over the opening few seconds of the trailer?  Thank you.
This movie is GREAT!!
Absolutely fantastic movie 100%!!!! Thank you Adam Sandler!!!!!!!
" skinny human "... One very good sci-fy movie...is not Space Odyssey but is in the same vein. I love it, watch it twice and also downloaded in my phone. Remind me a lot of the movie  "Moon" from 2009... All lovers of mystery philosophical scy-fi, must watch this movie.
Can we stop cropping movies soo much? I want my entire TV screen utilized please. 16x9
Movie was okay ending was good rest all a threaded
A space spider is super lame. Endless possibilities and...... spider
el acertijo tiene una voz muy calmada como la de hall o la de hue de final space
Let me gues Adam Sandler acting like Adam Sandler.  At the end of the movie he will stop acting like a kid and will marry the hottest woman.? 😂😂😂
This gave me Love, Death and Robots - Beyond the Aquila Rift vibes. Looks awesome!
This movie is a waste of time
Adam Sandler trippin balls in space with a giant spider was not on my bingo card for 2024...
Skinny human
Overall I liked the movie but it's not a great movie. The whole "God's Loneliest Astronaut" has been done before, better, in other films but the dialog between Adam Sandler and Paul Dano (who plays the space spider) are very compelling to watch. The movie is centered around Sandler's relationship with his wife played by Carey Mulligan (who is unfortunately wasted here, she doesn't get much to do) and yet the real narrative thrust is between Sandler and Dano. I just wish the ending had a stronger emotional landing than it did, it sort of drowns in its own philosophical word soup and doesn't come to any true catharsis or emotional upswell, it just sort of keeps the same tepid moodyness the rest of the film set. I still think it's worth a watch.
“Skinny Human”
This is gonna be a solid movie.  Nice to see something original.  Adam Sandler has been nailing a lot of his serious roles.  And Paul Dano is an interesting choice to play an alien.  It's nice to be excited for a movie these days.
Small piece of Czech Republic in Netflix film with Adam Sandler 🇨🇿🤗 bravo 👏👏👏
Meh
i like spiders now
I love watching space movie and I really hate spider. Thank you netflix.
I know Ingrid Bergman died YEARS ago, but until they showed Isabella Rossalini, I would have sworn it was her mother.  God, she sounds just like her mother.  Amazing.
Good film. Makes you contemplate your OWN life ❤
The story of his parents, late eighties and nighties in Czech Republic and the story of Jan Hus were extremely important to the plot in the book so i kinda hope they don't just omit them.
Brought me to tears
Not gonna lie. This looks good. Finally a movie I want to watch
stick to comedy
🕷️ “Skinny human”
Best movie I´ve seen in a while!
24 hr marathon of Adam Sandler movies!
Looks boring
This movie trash 🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️
What would spiders told humans if they could talk?:-Stay away from our webs😀
I watched the entire movie and is sucked!!! Talk about laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamesville!!! 👎👎👎👎👎💩💩💩💩💩
Hanuš is the friend I wish I had
Trash
Worst movie, your just wasting your  time watching this stupid movie
This movie was great but very emotional man a real tear jerker
Movie might not be for everyone but Adam Sandler did great. Has a lot of metaphor such as is it really a spider or divine intervention guiding Adam towards self-realization of his thoughts, ego, emotions, past deeds, and how they impacted others and himself including his childhood. Coming to terms in isolation, loneliness, fear, regret towards gratitude & growth. Even the cosmos symbolic of the character’s evolution & expansion. Spider was weird but get it. Facing yourself is scary and even ugly at times just like the spider making Adam & audience uncomfortable. So many go through this just not on a spaceship.
If anything, the closing song alone is worth the watch. -like this movie, it’s cringy uncomfortable but halfway through it gets interesting.
tf is this garbage
Couldn't have imagined adam in a serious motion picture role..  Great for him.
Beautiful 😢
someone tell me this is crap before I waste mins I'll never get back
What is the song at 1:03 ?
I think Netflix doesn't  know that if you're around Jupiter,  there's no way you can have instant two way  conversation with earth.  It would take  at least over 30mins for a signal  to get to Jupiter and 30mins to get something back .  Please do some actual research before writing  your little stories  Netflix.
I wish it was a comedy.
This movie is getting so much hate for some reason. Im convinced the people that don’t like this movie are the ones that are fast minded and can’t sit still for 5 minutes and constantly searching for something new to satisfy them or are too mucho to acknowledge their feelings. This movie is so good that it makes u forget how bizarre it sounds to be talkin to an impossibly large wolf spider.  This felt like an incredibly eye opening long overdue and visually stunning therapy session that reveals all the answers to the universe that we’ve all been longing for. A true masterpiece
this sort of reminds me of a book i read a couple of years ago....
This film is incredible. I honestly am so happy there is a film about space that's more about curiosity then danger. ❤
bit of a werid movie for adam to do but hes steppin out side of comedy for a change
What a piece of junk is this ???
One of the Adam Sandler gems.
biggest POS movie I ever saw. what a waste of time. and I cant get. that time back. F U. Netflix !!!
Finally seeing spiders getting the recognition they deserve for their emotional intelligence!
Just finished this POS movie, and I don't think I have ever hit the fast-forward button  so much in one movie before. Biggest Piece of crap in a long time. 💩
The Lord of the Rings spider flew into space. An alien would be better.
Anyone else getting Hail Mary vibes ?
My girl said she saw it and told me it sucked and to never ever watch it. I said, "yeah sandler cant do comedy anymore..."  She said, " it's not a comedy..." I told her "so you're telling me a movie with Adam Sandler going to space to meet a talking spider ISN'T a comedy?" She said... " Yes 😭".
Just finished this film. It shook me to my core. Sandler is incredible. This is one of the most beautiful and lovely films i have seen in quite some time. I'll be thinking about this for a while. 😢
Adam should keep doing serious roles. He's amazing at them. I truly feel like he missed his true calling in his mid career. Should of switched to serious roles a long time ago
What’s the name of the song playing with this trailer?
Looks too sad for me man
Calling it out now, the wife is the alien, but psychosis.
This looks like a movie that’s on a TV in the back round of a movie that’s really not good.
What’s the song starting at 1:05????
An alien spider?! Lmao cmonnn r u serious? Lmao they couldve chose the alien o look like anything in the world and they chose a spider? Like really?! Lmfaoo
Loved this movie
Why are people hatin on this movie
The goats losin it
Chutiya flim hai  kya bhai... Is it  boring
great movie to watch late at night in silence
This movie is getting bashed big time by critics and many fans but I must say I liked it. I do know it's not for everyone. It's a mood movie. It's not an action movie it's more a love story.
This was a really amazing film the story and the emotions were just great definitely a movie I would want to watch for the first time again if I could
Adam goin all out
Adam Sandler's it's a clown. He shines in funny movies.  Ya pick wrong actor for this
What a dumb, disappointing movie. It's like a Castaway theme and a wannabe Interstellar vibe. I love Adam but this sucked.
This is a movie about me , in an alternate reality.
very bad movie, very very bad
I watched this at Netflix.  Adam didn’t fail like what he does with all his movies. This movie is a masterpiece. Adam is gonna get a Oscars Award for this with the Hanuš as the sidekick. Halfway through. I cried till the movie is done. Then I called my cousin over. He drove in the middle of the night just to get to me through storm and hell. Once he got to my place. We watched this movie together. Both of us cried and wailing together. We can’t stop. So I gave my granpa a call. He came even tho he needs to get through the encampment. He dug a hole through the barbed wire. Past hundreds of guards. Once he got to my place. He joined us. He ended up crying till the movie is done. Thanks Adam for this beautiful acting that made me, my cousin and my granpa cried. 🙏🏼🙏🏼
I don't understand, why would they send someone into space with a wife and child on the way? How would a psychologist approve something like that?
who knew harry potter would be cannon in space.
I really don't get why people hate on this movie so much. I really enjoyed it, oh well. Each to their own, I suppose.
At minute 11:00 of the end of the movie, I thought he had been in a coma for 6 months and was suffering from cancer, which takes on the role of Hanush. With the death of Hanoush, he recovers from the disease and returns to life again, only to wake up in the hospital with his beloved Lenka by his side 👽🫂
في الدقيقة ١١:٠٠ من آخر الفيلم إعتقدت أنه في غيبوبة لمدة ٦ أشهر وكان يعاني مع مرض السرطان والذي يأخذ دور هانوش  ومع موت هانوش يتعافى من المرض ويعود للحياة مجددا ليستيقظ في المشفى وحبيبته لينكا بجانبه 👽🫂    At minute 11:00 of the end of the movie, I thought he had been in a coma for 6 months and was suffering from cancer, which takes on the role of Hanush.

A truly remarkable and deeply emotional film with an impactful message! Adam Sandler delivers a phenomenal performance!
spiders name is "Hanus". did anyone else lookup what it stands for or means? Hairy anus LOL
Hi Kristina, great show again. I'm looking forward to your Zennihome show coming a week from Tuesday. I'm the guy you were talking about earlier in the vlog moving into the first Zennihome. Peace!
Don't let the IMDB and rotten tomato's rating put you off this. It's brilliant.  It's one of those films that haunt you in awe afterwards. You keep thinking about it. Wondering. Examining your own life from it's message. Watch it.
Amazing movie 😢
I'm less than half way through this film but it's wonderful. I'm a long time science fiction film fan and an ASMR fan. Nuf sed!
Adam in a series role ?!! I love this !
I feel like this spider is an actual being out there or more like them.
This has more views than in the Czech Republic. And Cosmonaut from Bohemia is also a Czech book
This movie has it hard for me to swallow it has a deep meaning to me frl❤️
Hanus has my respect i swear intelligent genuine being💪🏾
A very bad movie. After it ends, you will find yourself regretting that you wasted nearly two hours watching it because it talks about a meaningless hallucination of a man in space. I do not know why movies have become so trivial in our time.
Adam Sandler doing a Ingmar Bergman version of severe depression while talking to a giant spider on his space rocket. Why !? was the first thing i thought after nearly two hours of wasted time.
For all the haters in here, you didn’t understand it because you’re just a skinny human.
What is the song?
What did I just watch 😂 was ok I guess 😅
Dumbest movie I have ever seen in my life.
Spider in space? Was this not Andy Weir's Project Hail Mary?
Hmmm similarities to Hail Mary Project that really needs to be a movie as well
That's a giant spider. I refuse to watch this movie, BECAUSE THERE'S A GIANT FCKNG SPIDER. >.>
boring af
after 33 minutes of a couple of guys whispering to each other, I just turned it off...oh yeah...never mind the evil fish wife!   crazy!
it's feel like meditation ❤❤❤❤
it reminds me of the book project hail Marie by andy weir
I never thought an Adam Sandler Movie could make me cry... Bravo!
This wasn't it.
Adam Sandler deserves an award of some kind.
This movie boring asf 😂
Stopped watching 10min into it as there was no communication delay while talking to an astronaut in Jupiter's orbit. It's 33min.
This movies is so bad…. It’s unwatchable … pure nonsensical, just another astronaut movie where the guy misses his wife and can’t stand being lonely. Geez… give the job to a single man next time. Seriously… palm-to-face
Weirdest movie I've seen .🕷️🕸️
WTH was that ending tho
Amazing Movie. Great visuals, beautiful storytelling, great acting and a deep understanding of emotional connection
If you can't fall asleep just start watching this. You will be down in 5mi.
"Farewell, Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those who knew you won't forget! Though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your forest home. May your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained." --Horace Slughorn; Aragog's eulogy
Some people perceive him as if his roles define him, like he's really as dumb as Happy Madison or Water Boy just because he did such an unbelievably good job as an actor. I've followed him for over 20 years and the man is a genius whether that is expressed through standup, lyrics, acting or full on film development he rarely disappoints. I'll admit that a few of his movies were duds like one of his earliest semi serious roles in the film Spanglish, that movie made no sense unless you were looking for a great argument on the side of total nihilism to a point where suicide seems like an attractive option or if you are curious as to what a film looks like after the writers just give up on trying to make a point. That said, this looks like a banger so I'm cooking a porterhouse and drinking some local brew while I treat myself tonight. It's been a little too long since I've seen a real movie.
But why Czech Republic 🇨🇿 ?
What a great movie ❤
Unintentional ASMR. Cause this crap put to me asleep. Typical simp for girl guilt trip. Simp till the end of the universe.....
He is having a Renaissance and I love it
The wife is a disgusting and evil narcissist. And of course Netflix has to make her go gay 🙄 Obnoxious woke garbage.
I don't know how I felt about this.  I loved Moon and Solaris....I enjoy space movies of any kind but even though it was interesting I'm really not sure I liked it.  Or understood it.  Or care.
IMDb 5.8?!... These guys are so disconnected from creation and quality.
Adam Sandler is a brilliant actor, but this movie is boring af tbh. Maybe because i was expecting an adventurous sci fi.
Anyone who has seen this film won't be able to take Dano's voice out of their head for a while. It's so hypnotic, haunting, like Hal 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey.
One of the most saddest scene i seen is when they hug
More space fairytales for the dumbed down masses… 🤦‍♂️
Legit 8 billion people around and had to send one with wife and unborn child.. lol
Movie was such a waste of time. Everything was inept and wrong about it. The plot could have been so much .better. His acting was on par but why didn’t the alien call him fat human?? If that’s what we have to look forward to in his different acting roles I think he should stick to his bread and butter…….Comedy
Unwatchable. Forced myself to go on after the first 15 minutes, but with the dread that it wouldn't get better. I was right. It didn't. Turned it off immediately. How tf did Netflix ever think this film was a good idea??
Long ass boring film, i dont mind long ass boring films but this was really long ass and boring
I love adam but my phobia I can't do it I well see on your next movie after this
this is great to be serious. good luck Aragog
Every now and then Sandler picks up a heater and just kills it. This looks awesome
Wow! Adam Sandler can do more than d*ck and fart jokes👍
Just watched this Movie yesterday and I was right you need to be on some good drugs but Adam Sandler is an Awesome Actor I am very surprised he took this part but who ever wrote this movie needs to get a different job because it sucked !!!!!
Watching this stoned is a one hella experience
"The Hail Mary Project" by Andy Weir "The Martian", would have made a better movie. BTW i have worked with lots of people from eastern Europe in the past and found the very nice but depressing to be around for an extended time
Hmm sorry pass. That wife looks so toxic I hate it when they make another movie about toxic woman and poor man.
I thought this film was beautiful and original. And helped me overcome my fear of spiders a bit honestly ♥ 🕸
The automatron from South Park, A.W.E.S.O.M-O finally got to hollywood, writing scripts like "what if Adam Sandler is an astronaut in space but then in turns out his marriage is in trouble, and he gets help from a giant spider, or something.
If I was stuck in a spacecraft by myself for months, I don't think I'd enjoy being kept company by a spawn of Shelob.
Maybe the worse load of crap i have ever wasted my time on👎
Trash movie . Worst movie . horrible movie.  Dont waste ur time this movie🥱🥱🥱🥱
Finally, something that has no bIack bs.
Never gonna watch this boring shĩt 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Seemed really good until I saw a talking spider.
I think he showld make more movies like this  hes good on it and might not know
Those who don't like this movie needs soul searching
Looks dumb
Magnificent movie! Not wasted a single sec watching this movie ❤️
This is a crazy horror movie for people with arachnophobia.
Just watched the movie, greatest movie I've watched Ina long time
I really enjoyed this movie. It was thoight provoking and intriguing
one of the dumbest movie i have ever seen in the last 21 years. Before that it was The Room(2003),which is not dumb anymore because it is so bad it's kinda funny.
Okay well. I have to explain it. This movie is based on a book by Jaroslav Kalfař. Story is supposed for people who want think about relationship, motivations in life and  behave of human being. It is not iterstellar kind movie. Space here represents only estrangement and loneliness of human soul. I am czech and happy if somebody create something bohemian but I have to admit this kind of art is not for me, but i will not write criticism on that omly because i dont like this genre. Movie effects and camera sounds evrything is really good. Just that story is not for evrybody.
Don't waste your time watching this pointless shit
Absolute crap movie! i like Adam Sandler movies but this was his worst one
In my opinion it is a master piece, the three years it was in post-production was worth it, I missed a film that made me feel the way this film made me feel.
이기적인 여자와 미쳐가는 남자 설득력도 없고 그럴듯 하지도 않고 좋아하는 배우라 봤는데  실망이 큰 작품 무슨 얘기를 하고 싶은지는 알겠는데  감독이 중2병 걸렸나 싶음 그동안 좋은 작품 만들더니 왜 여기다 똥을 싼거야 너무 유치해서 도저히 공감이 안됨  아담은 이딴거 찍을거면 차라리 코미디나 더 찍어라
THIS MOVIE PROVES EVEN MILLIONS OF MILES AWAY A WOMAN CAN STILL F YOUR SOUL. AVOID WOMAN AT ALL COSTS THEY ARE DEMONS
Looks shxt let's be honest
Looks dumber than Joe Biden trying to add 2+2 on a chalk board while sniffing a little girl's hair.
That movie what saying i dont understand,  please help me ,that movie is really mixed ...  Losing mind or finding ownselves  Or How can u frtighten space or how u can frighten space it is freaky  Or Belief of space include other universal or all of them are lenght of size own earth shadows/vibrations etc. Or  It is only related to any movie what u have your mind and included in the movie such as rubish brain storm .... Or It is only lonely actor performans watching ... Or  Space aliens are only animals of earth and they lived and made human natural body ... Or  The others alien creature body only made egss from any body and and life... Or Light of Blue include piece of cosmic knowledge codding and codes ...
This movie really irritated me. His wife in the movie is so insanely SELFISH!!
it’s good to see him in a movie that his wife and kids might not be in
I slept three times watching this movie over again... today I'm sitting and watching from the chair so tat I won't fall asleep
A movie about a astronaut who gets lonely in space and a lady who misses her husband who is a astronaut. Basically if you date an astronaut be prepared to not see them for a while abit like a long distance truck driver.
Man im just trying to drink a beer
So disappointing reading some of these comments
cool!!!
That movie was close to home it was so deep, the ending tho 👍🏼 definitely recommend and would love to see Adam do some more movies like this.
This is a result of comedian playing the role in Psychological film.. It was 2hs of disaster!
This will be one boring movie
Such a awesome movie
Sorry, I REALLY tried, BUT, everytime that Mr Rogers spider said "Skinny Human" I laughed my ass off.!!! Longest "Sat Night Live" skit ever..... Nice work "Skinny Human" 😂 LMAO !!!
One of the best movies I have seen in a while, Adam Sandler did great, Hanuš did great as well and the music is outstanding!
ゴロムペットを恨む
Perhaps one of the stupidest movie I've watched last time.After all those strong roles and movies who he played,what were sensational.He shoot and act in a movie where you talk to a spider🤔😂
Why are all filmmakers so unoriginal when it comes to the portrayal of extraterrestrial entities?? They're either 'little grey humanoids' or 'big ugly spider or beatle monsters'... I mean, isn't there any other options? The imagination on this topic can be so huge and creative!!!
This movie is so bad, i stop watching after 25 min, Sandler is such a bad actor, simple question gets so stupid answer in this movie.
Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler are what I always realized once again that comedians are really good at acting. Look at their drama. It's amazing. It's about the movie, and it's inspired me deeply. Highly recommend.
Loved the movie. I shed a tear as well.
Such an alignment am into at this moment! Thank you universe for this enlightening & alignment movie to my soul purpose ❤❤ gratitude always ♾️🪷🦋🪄✨❤️
This film touched my soul in ways I can’t describe. I don’t go into this movie expecting what I got out of it. I Thought it was gonna be about him and some random alien in space but it actually ended up being about everything I’m feeling. So basically it ended up being about isolation, loss, atonement, commitment, and depression. Also taking for granted everything you have. All along while wondering if this spider if a figment of hallucinatory origin due to mental health decline and depression, or if he was there all along.
Just watched this boring ass movie. What the hell are you thinking Adam Sandler!?!?!?!!!
Amazing
The bug & spider combo at the end immediately dried my tears! Skin was too busy crawling! lol
Lmfao what a dumb ass movie
Just finished watching this beautiful movie ❤
What a great movie
Drecksfilm
spoiler alert he fks the spider
Another 1 person movie where's the good movies at all I see anymore is one or 2 actors anymore
This was an amazing movie. I cant really begin to describe how beautiful  it was.
Don't Go Away Oasis
oh my, how to get through it without cracking up??? There lies a challenge! A poor lonely astronaut... finds a woke 6 eyed spider friend from outer space in a big purple cloud? okay... Can I get some of whatever that author was on???
Cash grab movie.  Not impressed at all.  Make a real movie not for Netflix
This movie made a spider absolutely adorable. And the way the spider eats the Nutella is so cute. The ending was emotional. But the movie wasn’t that great. But Adam Sandler did a good job, he’s good at doing serious roles
Madame Web was better than this 😂
Snoozer. Zzzzzzzz....
If this was a sci-fi/horror, i would definitely watch.  I can't take emotional dramas. 😢
Lame
whats music is it between 1:03 and 1:23, thank uuu ( sounds a bit like moonlight sonata ! )
i was waiting for a fart joke
I loved it! ❤
I cried in Click so I’ll probably cry in this
Does some body know the number of the music pn the background of this trailer
i just watched it and i would’ve never thought crying to a giant spider, eating chocolate,  floating in space while dying 😭😭😭
Wtf is this
Judging by the comments I was right. Straight garbage like I thought. Sandler is so overrated
there is no way this isnt a billy and mandy au
Oh boy, so bad. A spider therapist? Really? 2hrs of a dude talking to a spider about his feelings? Why? This movie was so unnecessary. 😞
Bag of shite.
Gaaaay
Huge Sandler fan, but this movie sucks. Slow and boring. Where’s are comedies?
lol looks stupid. Sandler is way overrated. Vomit 🤮
My arachnophobia was waiting for the spider to attack the whole movie …
The movie, was 100% perfect. I have one thing i couldn’t help but notice, the whole movie they say skinny human but he’s nothing but skinny ! He seemed like he weights alot and shouldn’t they in space loose so much weight ?
Haha, that's my country's flag, happy to see it promoted by Adam Sandler playing a Czech spaceman character 😇
OMG, this had to be the worst movie I’ve seen in awhile, right next to Crimes of the Future. It was so boring. And a Czech couple with heavy English and New Jersey accents? C’mon,huh!
Fantasic film. Sandler proves to be an outstanding dramaric actor if he wishes it and Paul dano should do more voice acting .
At first I though spider were play his mind game then eat him up once he call him fatty lol 😂
While people fight to be on the top the fail to realize that it’s the Memorable that last Forever. Adam Sandler may not be a Clooney or a Pit but he has yet to throw a movie out that you won’t remember. Good or bad.
Instead of this, watch Constellation or that episode of Black Mirror, "Beyond the Sea"... much better...
This feels how I feel oddly. Sad strange movie but good.
I bald my eyes out when yanoosh died I can admit that great movie!
Adam Sandler no matter what move has to wear 3 quarter length shorts and a baggy shirt.
You want to experiment something similar to this, but on EARTH? BECOME A OTR TRUCK DRIVER!!
I don't even know how to describe this movie. Sad. Sad but interesting. Not much going on but still watched it all.
I was expecting something solid instead it ended up being a complete horseshit movie.
Kafkaesque
Never been so bored shitless in my life, thanks fook for fast forward.
Right pile of 💩
Loved it! truly. those who don't want to visit the topic of difficulty in a relationship probably won't like it. I loved it. Slight grimes and elon vibes
Sorry, but the moment you introduce Adam Sandler into a film, I just shut off my brain and go on autopilot. I just can't take anything he does seriously.
the biggest borefest on netflix
Aragog is back 😮
Brilliant 👏 👏 👏 👏
they should have called it Spiderman. missed opportunity
2 hours of my life I won't get back 😴
Wth did I just watch it had potential but they should of done like a alien the spider just seemed to not fit just saying
Garbage 🗑️
Ahhh yes, depressed Bedtime Stories
Only people who don't understand it will say it's terrible. Whimsical, philosophical and the kind of movie that keeps you thinking about the meaning of life and the universe for days.
If kerry mulligan was my misses I would go to Jupiter too..
I'm sorry, but I'm NOT impressed. I feel bad for Adam. I'm still a fan and always will be, but my god. It's the first bad review I've ever left. The background music wasn't the best, the mood was strange and I lost track quickly. The only funny part is when Adam gave the space spider something to sooth himself with, out of his pocket. You've let me down.
I found this movie very well done. So emotionally expansive. The spider facade is ok.
So we have emotional support spiders now? 😂 this does look stunning
ANOTHER DUMB MOVIE FROM NETFLIX........ WHAT'S NEW....... NOTHING!
Only Sandler can put out a sci-fi trailer that elicits Zero Interest.
Adam sandler, in the skin of a character like we have never seen before in his long career as an actor.
This movie was boring and shit.
Tried to watch this, but it was Boring turd
Aragog in space with Waterboy looks weird
the movie was boring af
mf i don't give af how lonely i am if i see a huge ass spider like that im burning everything including me.
this thing is execrable
Claro mensaje!!! para el egoísta!
Just finished it.  Weird, majestic and honestly, emotionally devastating.
We heard of dogs, cats,etc... as emotional support animals. But an emotional support space spider. Wow
This movie isn’t for everyone and there’s a lot to comment on. A lot of things could been better. Definitely not for the fast & furious crowd.    But I think it can hit the spot for some people who share Jakub’s issues.
This is actually shit
Thumbs up for me as I am a skinny human
Beautifull amazing well written movie. Exceptional visuals and emotional. Those damn ninja cutting onions.
So freaking boring
I was absolutely mesmerized by this from beginning to end! 😱❤️
Is it better than Jack and Jill?
So freaking boring
Watched it last night. The film was great!
The AI writing script does it again!
I would give everything to forgor the movie and watch it again in the cinema  What a refreshing piece of art!  Paul Dano's voiceover gave me so much goosebumps
That spider is gay he tries to sleep with Adam.  Movie is partly about a gay spider, sounds is joined LGBTQ 🏳️‍🌈 😂😂😂
*THIS IS LITERALLY A RIP-OFF OF THE MOVIE "MAGELLAN" FROM A FEW YEARS AGO....EXACT SAME PLOT AND NARRATIVE.*
really loved it
Anyone else cried watching this movie ?
Even in space you cannot escape the drama women bring to the table.
Dont even bother to see this SHIT MOVIE.
Amazing actor but his a  actor of  constant truth as he gets older productive actor brilliant
Humanity needs Hanus more than ever right now.
Touchy-feely dreck. 👎
One of the most thought provoking movies i ever seen. Loved it
but why a spider ?
Just watched it, and I loved it!
Best movie I've seen in a while... Adam Sandler does his best work when he is not trying to make you laugh
Creepy
Chopra reminds me of u-do (unus-mundus drive operation)
Solaris
Is this out
So the spider isn’t bad..?
one of the fatal mistake on this film is distance of the spacecraft from earth 500.000.000 km and the electromagnetic pulse moving approx. at 300.000 km/sec, it need 1.666 sec for signal to arrive on earth or 27,7 minutes. It's impposible for teleconference in realtime because of time delay. 😄
Is this a comedy? I was waiting for the overdramatic music and sarcastic seriousness to dissolve with a joke drop, but the trailer ended.
57 year old astronaut???
an interesting film to think about, but not for everyone 7/10
Didn’t anyone in production or even associated with the movie see how the muppet looking spider is laughable and ridiculous. The tone of the movie is so serious and melancholic but as soon as the spider makes its presence along with Paul Dano’s voice, it makes me think I’m watching an SNL skit and I’m waiting for the punchline. The only positive thing that can be said about the movie is that Adam Sandler’s performance is impressive. He’s an incredible dramatic actor.
Ffs I wanted to watch this until I saw that damn spider
yikes bro
In the first 10 minutes I thought it was a good normal movie, but it turned out really crap! 😒🙁☹☹🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮
Mr sandler your hocus pocus act is laughable, as your acting chomps 😬 is derelict you might as well fetch a pail 🪣 of water for your hack & sack auditions. Call Zohan!? 😂😂😂😂at the alter 🎂?
the only problem is that there is instant communication between Earth and spaceship. ruins all the 'sci' in sci-fi
fell asleep during the trailer.... think im gonna skip this one
They show too much in these trailers. I loved this movie and glad I did not watch the trailers.
This movie is so peaceful.
Strasna sracka
1/5💩
A movie about a weak and lonely man crying out in space? 😂😂😂 Nah...
such a beautiful movie
Another bad film with Netflix
What a disappointment. 3/10.  Another no charisma incredibly boring lame interpretation of forced failing romance from a cold selfish fool, realizing it all from an alien with supernatural ability to his mind, who looks like a damn spider. Awful writing, direction, lacking feel, and performance.
Bad movie
Nothing seemed special, boring spaceman movie.The audience was fooled after seeing the spider monster, week concept flop movie👎🥱
가슴을 울리는 감명깊은 영화입니다.
Was almost a good or very good film. I really like the brave attempt. It was a lot better than a lot of Scifi made now days. Worth a watch.
Not a movie for people with arachnophobia, I was paralyzed in absolute horror most of the movie and fainted at a certain moment that happened 15 minutes before the ending, that might have been touching for everyone else, but was the pinnacle of panic attack of terror for me.
Is this any good?
I've tried to watch it three times and that's it. It is about as joyful and uplifting as a Leonard Cohen album left on loop. They will be handing out free Xanax on the way out the exits.
I prefer more entertainment type films, this one I think you can get more from reading your star sign and the day what it has in store for you, on page 6 of the daily mirror. Humbug
Don’t watch it, you will get disappointed
Paul Dano carries this
U can mske any alien look like anything but u choose something like a bloody spider. If i was on that spaceship i be freaking out haha
What a horrible movie. What were they thinking? And what was Adam thinking not doing Comedy. This movie is just as bad as recently when K. Heart did an action movie with no comedy in the movie Lift. Shit was horrible. Stick with what you do best boys.
Best movie I have ev watch
I can't say anything nice about this trailer
Awh cute asssss spidey! ❤
JUST WATCHED IT IT STRESSED ME OUT BRUH. but it was a really good movie, even though there wasn’t much to it it made me so emotional and it’s overall just so good oml 11/10
A 60 yr old astronaut?
Repetitive and clichéd scripts abound, showcasing Hollywood's apparent struggle to innovate in depicting the imaginative aspects of aliens, from their body structure to face, voice, and overall presence. .Hollywood struggles to produce fresh and distinctive narratives in space movies, evident in the strikingly similar storylines prevalent in the genre. The recurring theme involves a protagonist or main character grappling with the isolation of their loved ones in space. Additionally, the portrayal of aliens adheres to a predictable and unimaginative concept, often depicted as spider-like creatures. This pattern suggests that scriptwriters face challenges in presenting aliens with diverse characteristics, including their shape, voice, face, and overall structure.
This movie sucked😂
Horrible movie
did it really need to be a spider?😐
Anyone got the movie? Like wtf did I just see?
Is that Billy's son Jeff the Spider?
What is the song that plays in the trailer? I really like it!
music @ 0:16 is Nocturne No. 20 by FORES
What song is playing does anyone know?
Very good movie. So captivating and mediatative. Really loved it
I bet I know the ending, he's probably already dead.
Lol gawd this looks depressing 🤣
interstellar 2.0.... awesome movie !
hes ready to ball up in space with the fit
This is the perfect blend of Interstellar, Castaway, and Eternal Sunshine on a Spotless Mind.
So, they have faster than light videoconferencing?
Seems complicated….
What in this world , the producers SMOKE MAN!!!!!! What Waist of time
Wonderful film, really touched parts of me that TV never usually reaches. The spiders voice is beautiful and soothing.
Dumbest most boring movie ever made skinny human
Just watched it and I got to say truthfully this is the most boring piece of work I have ever seen it just as bad as watching paint dry or watching grass grow.
Does anyone have a screenshot of the giant spider hug? Love that image!
What a boring movie
Some boring af day dreams he keeps having
Yo Netflix. How’s this movie been out for a week and I haven’t seen it ANYWHERE on my homepage?  I had to manually search for it to find it.  Give the Sandman some love!!❤️
Its a 10/10 for me. Love Adam Sandler as Spaceman!
I lost interest after Spiderman didn't eat him or suck out his inerds. Should have gave Spidey Skippy extra crunchy then go back to earth to have a spider space baby with his wife and live happily ever after in newly renamed Moscow as Navalny.
Man when he played in reign on me omg….one of my favorite movies he did wow
Don't get wrong I love adam sandler. But I have a bad case of arachnophobia. I don't think I can watch this movie lol
50% movie 50% Skinny human
Jouvon Kingsby wins 23 Million dollars in the California Lottery
Dumb movie super horrible 💯
Who does the song?
What is the song used in this?
Absolutely amazing movie. I really enjoyed it so much. 100/10
I didn’t like it. And normally i like adam’s movies. This was a weird story, he didn’t showed a lot of emotions… it was kinda boring. Only in the beginning thought this is gonna be good but it didn’t get better
me: ✨lonely✨  space spiders: ✨Unintrigued✨
I wasnt expecting much watching this but I really liked this movie
So does he cheat on his wife?
Won't be watching, looks boring
And.... Andy Weir gets no credit for some of these ideas?????
Wow. Amazing that people are so obsessed with...movie trailers. Oh: Is there any chance of seeing Adam Sandler's daughters...nude, in the near future of Holly/Net woke movies? Come-on. All new actresses gotta show some skin.
Soothing voice coming from a giant spider, no effing way!
Time to get back to doing Happy Gilmore rolls.....
Such a good movie 10/10
This is one of those psychological BS movies that go nowhere
I can’t wait🤯😰😳!!!
IDK... this spider is weird, it's like an emotional movie with some kids CGI, or maybe a horror CGI?  I think it will be hard for me to take this seriously as it tried to be
I’m so use to seeing him in Comedy movies
Looks very boring....
If you have ArachnoPhobia do NOT watch this movie Alone If you have ArachnoPlihilia...... watch it alone
For the curious: The music in the background is "Nocturne No. 20" by FORES (aka Sam Bailey)
I thought it would be similar to Interstellar but God I made the worst mistake of watching this crap. It's a mockery of Sci-fi & purely a flop.
Boring...not for everyone
0:32 OOPS!! Looks like Dr. Strange botched another spell for Peter Parker!
Most booooooooring movie i ever seen
Genocide enabler
Ok wtf was this movie? Adam 😢😢 I hope other people enjoy this because Adam is my favorite but if I have to watch one more movie where a dude pines over a woman but instead of just confronting it he has to go to flipping space and talk to a friggin space spider until he almost dies, I’m going to unalive myself.
I'll pass.
This movie absolutely sucked, Adam what is wrong with you you really reaching to the bottom of the barrel for this garbage, are you really that washed up you did a horrible movie like this this has got to be the dumbest movie I have ever seen seriously the dumbest movie Adam give up your career you're done I wouldn't do another movie after this I wouldn't even admit that you were in this movie but you have to because your face is in it there's got to be a way to get away from this tragedy this disaster this is an absolute nightmare of a movie I cannot believe you did this movie I lost all respect for you I don't think I'll ever watch another movie you are in again this movie really sucked absolutely sucked what was this movie even about it's so stupid how did he even make it into the fkn movie world,  Teletubbies would have been better than tbus garbage.   Absolutely the worst movie ever produced
is it any good? preview doesnt look great lol
THIS IS CRAZY 😮! I was just randomly looking for a movie to watch, and came across this trailer. For all the people looking for the vocalist behind the intro song, he goes by the name of FORES (he released the cover today). He is actually a friend of mine, and this is such a coincidence because we have a song together called A Million Suns (would have been an amazing opportunity for this movie), thought this would be a once in a lifetime opportunity to share it.
SkINNy HuMan 🕷️
If people can connect with this huge spider then maybe we'll get that 'Children of Time' adaptation someday...
Adam Sandler probably delivered his most evocative role as an astronaut on a mission to discover something in the outskirts of Jupiter ...
This movie is like the prequel to Jack Gyllenhaal's enemy!
Movie was a mixed bag, has very strong moments, hanus is adorable, but it also has weak moments. Ending seemed rushed.
corny
Best funny movie he made
Sorry but that spider is scary as shit.
1:35 ghey
Saw this today, so refreshing to see Sandler in a NORMAL role. And also refreshing to see an original “space” film, 8/10
The movie is good but let me tell you.. Fvck Lenka  edit, just finished it, fvck me, instead
Boring af, not worth it.
Very sad😢
God this was so good
I don't get it. Is this not a Project Hail Mary ripoff? Which was written first? Too similar.
Weirdest thing about this movie was the unused Sriracha in the kitchen
This movie its not about an astronaut but psychonaut. Space is a analogy for a journey into yourself. A woman is "I", an inner voice, a child is spirit. Holy Trinity. Once again, the film presents us with two scenarios and two worlds, two levels of perception. They do the same thing as in New Constellation. The hero experiences an internal battle after the brain receives less and less stimuli and enters the path of champions to awakening...
This better be better than the cobbler 💩💩
Excellent movie. 9/10.  Well worth your time.
I just watched it, the saddest movie I've ever watched. Watch it stoned
Looks crap 💩
very good!
Great movie!
I'm not sure how this got 72,000 likes it looks pretty boring. No action. Don't think it'll keep me interested. And I've always been a fan of Adam Sandler but not today.😢
Solitude doesn't work like this..  It remains as an empty void & gets easier to cope with the longer you are alone.  You don't really want to think about it so you make yourself busy with other things.  Who ever wrote this was super high & doesn't understand the concept of solitude.  What you're seeing here instead is longing as they just came out of a relationship. People on Earth pretty often rebound because of that exact feeling & circumstance. Rebound is not recommended. Best to stay away from potential partners until your brain stops creating chemicals for longing. People grow the most when they are alone.
As a dramatic actor Sandler is a 10. As a. Comedy actor he’s a 6. Please do more drama🙏
What is this song?
Saw this movie it was terrible. Too much hindu and buddhist theme of trashy everything is as it should be. Lol. 😂.  Not a good film.  Wasted time watching it.  4 thumbs down.
Adam Sandler in space with a spider wow that's new 😅
damn can we just get some nice movies without so many god damn feelings on the way of everything?
Most bull shi movie don't waste your time
I stop watching after 2 minutes. If you communicate with the spaceship near Jupiter, you cannot speak in real time. It takes several minutes to send and receive a message. So, inaccuracy kills the movie from frame 1. BS.
Just watch it now lol
Spoiler alert  This is why one shouldn't depend on another human being for emotional support. What can we say about this woman who wants to ditch the man she loved enough to have a baby with knowing from the beginning of the relationship he was training for an important role as a spaceman and half way through the mission she dumps him in a recorded message? The adjectives coward, egotistical and selfish are the only ones I can use here. For all the men who have been stabbed in the back then gaslighted please don't watch this movie.
worst actor alive big fight for #1 with Nicolas Cage
1:03 song name?
Reminds me of Beyond the Aquila Rift episode from Love Death and Robots. Very interesting short story.
I haven't seen the movie yet. But it looks like cast away in space and the spider is Wilson.😂 They should have. Rob Schneider float by the outside window and say to Adam, you can do it!
Just finished watching it, fantastic movie. Critics say it needs humour, absolutely it does not just because it has Adam Sandler in it.
I knew that was Paul danos voice
Gave me a headache. Graphics leveled up tho but the monotonous pace made my head hurt.
The zero time delay on his press conference from Jupiter to Earth, ruins it for me... faster than speed of light phone lol. But I shall watch it now... well honestly, I really enjoyed it. It lingers  after you've watch it. Definitely psychological sci fi. If you're in the mood for that, maybe late at late. You'll enjoy it too. Recommended.
This movie is awesome.. Sandler crushed it.
lets goo adam Sandler is back
Man shoutout to Adam Sandler for dropping banger after banger the entire time I’ve been alive. Looking forward to this one.
I thought Adam Sandler retired from acting 😩
Whats the song in the beginning of the trailer? :o
This is looks like some really weird shit. Pass. Wtf sandler.
Another bomb
Anyone with arachnophobia stay away from this
Seems like Sandler is out to make a point like Jim Carrey did later in his career showing that he had the acting ability to do far more than comedy alone.
boy if i were the writer of project hail mary this would have me very angry.
Welp, looks like Netflix prices are gonna go up again...
I am still waiting for 'Project: Hail Mary.'
As soon as I saw the big talking spider it's a big no from me
NO.
This book was so fantastic, I was afraid the movie wouldn't be able to come close, but this trailer has made me NEED to see it.
anyone who knows the original orchestra music from this trailer? glad to hear it. thx for responses
I need to find the full soundtrack ❤ pls help
I wonder if this will be Adam's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Which had the fantastic dramstic performance by Jim Carrey. This does actually look really interesting. Though i wish they didnt show whst the posdible alien looked like in the trailer at least to give it some mustery. But still im looking forward to ot. Gotta say i love this version of Moonlight Sonata.
My arachnophobia won’t let me watch this. Sorry Adam.
SUS
Looks freaky. Nice to see Adam Sandler stepping out into more diverse types of roles. The guy is amazing.
Seems like a project hail merry  ripoff in a way.
Can't wait to see this. Carey Mulligan has to have one of the most flawless C.V's of an actor ever; she just goes from strength to strength.
That's why astronauts not allowed to grow weed on the space station
Just confused why there is a big spider there
Adam Sandler really shines in dramatic roles, can't wait to see him in this emotional rollercoaster of a movie!
looks rubbish
who is this aimed at?
Why does it have to be a spider 😭
This smells of great book, bad movie… but we will see
espero con ansias ver esta pelicula de este gran actor en una faceta poro vista en sus films, ciencia ficcion y drama
I wanted to see this movie upon hearing about it but the alien being a spider freaks me out
Looks like black mirror cap by Jessie Pinkman
Adam Sandler is great. There's no doubt about it, but seeing an Emotional Support Alien Spider just ruined it for me. 😂
I was hoping Kevin James would be the voice of emotional support spider😂
Somewhat Project Hail Mary. Spider reminded me of Rocky.
What the hell did I just watch
Czech Adam Sandler goes to space and meet manic pixie dream spider... I'm actually kinda curious about it
REBECCA CHAMBERS: "Ahhh! The Moonlight Sonata." CHRIS REDFIELD: "Can you play?"
That's where Shelob went
Was hoping it was "station 69" being made into a movie
I see Rob Schneider isn't in this film. Did he and Adam divorce? Did Adam forget to release him from the Gimp trunk? (pulp fiction ref.)
👀 like this will be another 🔥 🎥 okk Mr. Sandler 🎉 this will for sure be an interesting one nvr seen an emotional support 🕷 before😊 🙏
Roman Sadovskyi: "If we try to be objective, the film is not outstanding and does not offer anything new. It's an attempt to make Netflix's own Interstellar. Visually, the film looks very good, and I also liked Paul Dano's spider. I also can't help but mention the powerful soundtrack by Max Richter and the final song he recorded with the band Sparks. However, the film is quite straightforward in its narrative - a story and flashbacks, which is a bit too little to try to reach the level of Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. From the very beginning, the main idea, which was already present in Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris, becomes clear: space is big and lonely, and the Earth is our home. Spaceman is an incredibly beautiful and fascinating story, full of emotional depth and a re-experiencing of well-known truths. The film has a slogan: "I want to go home", which cannot but resonate with me as a person who found himself far from home because of the war in Ukraine. Because I want to go home too".

This shit looks like ass.. He was trash in UNCUT Gems😂😂
PLOT TWIST....The spider turns out to be Shooter McGavin!!
wtf is this
to jupiter???  get real.  lol
At first glance I thought this was "project hail Mary"... A bit disappointed it isn't 😢
How much do you wanna bet the spider ends up eating him?
another psycho drama the ultimate space cliche
Wow that went surreal pretty quick!
It sounds like "project hail Mary" book, which is amazing. But they are making that into movie too.
This almost seems like a live action, inspiration of that one episode from Love, Death, and Robots.
This looks incredible.
Let's turn "Project Hail Mary" into a ridiculous drama void of its original endeavors.  Let's make the Alien spider a counselor for Adam Sandler!  Astrophage, who knows 🤷‍♂️, I'll give it a chance, but I feel like this will just be Adam's silent role with strong emotional acting.  Oscar, anyone? Andy Weir??  Where is Andy Weir?? Tell us you said no.. Andy...
Trailer Music ?
I see Sandler and I come running in.
Why a spider 😂
Fantastic!! Can't wait!! <3
I’ll never trust her she always gone be daisy to me😂
Man my fiance and I just watched this movie and if you get it, you get it. It made us realize whats really important about our experience in this world. Although we both had a feeling of knowing; this movie really emphasizes it in a motion picture. 10/10 recommend but not everyones ready for it or will ever be.
I might watch it if you promise me he gets killed in the end.
He's finally flying on wings of a pepper. Bravo Pepper Boy!😊
One of the very few times I do hope that it’ll actually be a good Adam Sandler movie.
Sandler in punch drunk spider 😂😂😂 but honestly this looks amazing definitely gonna buy.
WTF did I just see
idk i would just binge watch a lot of sitcoms and movies and books, and songs i love and not really care about the being alone for 6months part
Looks like an absolute snooze fest.
Awe man that’s Paul Dano’s voice isn’t it!!! Awesome! I really like that dude!!! He’s a really great actor! Adam Sandler is one of my all time favorite actors; comedian as well; it’s just that his acting is amazing all around especially when he’s able to be put in a dramatic role!!! I love that guy man! Finally saw a stand up show of his live and it’s way better in person!
Looks interesting.
Theres a lot of talent in this trailer.  Sandler skips stones over water.  A few comedies.  But then he drops stones
Netflix are thieving grubs and steal from honest people
"Honey, I'm home!  I brought a friend.  Now I know you have a thing about spiders..."
sandler in a serious role⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️ an the spider looks scary as f*** 😵‍💫
Your neighborhood friendly Spider 🤓🕷️
Holy crap. I might actually voluntarily watch something with Adam Sandler in it. 🤨
Having the alien look like an earth spider is just as bad as having it look like a human. Aliens should be alien. They should also sound alien. Maybe it's communicating by telepathy, but bleh. Make it alien and give it a believable voice. Won't be watching.
Is the spider trans?
Best insect movie since Jeff Goldblum’s The fly
Whats the name of this music?
Astronauts don't usually have beards.
His costar reminded me of 'Rocky' from Project Hail Mary.
Alien: "I heard you need mental care so I came as fast as I can, I got you fam." -- the movie
Is it me or does spider sound like kuato from total recall (90s)🤔
Space spider?   Who knew
Clearly inspired from "Beyond the Aquila Rift" - Love Death and Robots
The best movie ever
Hopefully not a derivative of "Moon" or "Prospect". Adam should respect these movies and the people who made them them on the cheap.
If they’re going out of their way to cast Sandler…  Couldn’t they have done a better job w finding a spider that didn’t look like it came from a “Wild Things” story book…  Too tame
Adam Sandler was not my favourite in comedy films.  However, in serious acting, intelligent parts?  MORE PLEASE!
Did it have to be a giant spider!!? haha..... urghhhhh....
what a trash
Maybe Sandler is better in this drama rather than his comedies.  Max Richter soundtrack, so I will watch it.
جميل جد
Mükemmel kalitede film
As much as I want to see this......I just can't. I HATE spiders and that spider just freaks me out!
This looks terrible 😂
This comes out the same week as Constellation…. Strange coincidence. Almost like we live in some kind of alternate dimension….
Looks like project hail mary from andy wier
♥️
I am so happy that Adam Sandler finally gets the roles to release his potential.
Fictional space movies when done right are so amazing
Don't think ima care for this movie witch sucks because he's my fave actor but shall see
You had me at 'skinny human'.
Finally spiders get some positive representation
Can’t stand Sandler.
Why did Adam Sandler waited this long to make all these great characters! He totally kills it! Cant wait!
Friends of Hagrid
As if Europe would launch an American into space on an important mission.  At least he's suitably depressed.
❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥👑🐐
What is a song?
now i want a motional support spider.
Why is it that Comedians turn to serious movies when they get older... And serious actors turn to funny actors?😂😂😂
So, the giant spider eats him, right?.. that’s the twist.
Just wait until that spider breaks out the duct tape and starts singing Ave Maria
Why must it be a spider???!!!
Eww spider, cannot take that seriously as a therapist ugh
So happy that Spaceman of Bohemia is getting a proper adaptation. For those of you who don’t know this movie is based off of the book. I read it maybe 5 years ago and thought this would make a great movie but didn’t think anyone would adapt it. Thanks Adam
Definitely will have to Czech this one out.
This looks awesome
It’s the love death robots episode
First this and a movie called Sting. Guess it's the year of the Spiders 🕷!!
There might be some other big  element to the story that the trailer is hiding, but this trailer makes the wife character seem insufferable. She marries an astronaut and is like, "UGH. I HATE IT WHEN YOU GO TO *SPACE!* DO YOU EVEN LOVE ME??" Jesus Christ. 😂
I still don't quite see him in more serious movies. Just get instant flashbacks of his goofing in his funny films 😂
INTERESTING MUSIC HERE… FROM CHOPIN TO BEETHOVEN, INTRO TO A PRELUDE, THEN INTO MOONLIGHTS FIRST MVT. 😅😊 NICE!
Trailer song?
where i go you go, what i see you see
Can't wait to see it Adam, I know doing comedy all the time was exhausting for you and this movie will help you all who are afraid of space, your all braver than you think
Got to say I was hoping for a comedy movie from him but we'll see if it's any good 👍
Before I went flat earth I used to believe in all of this stuff floating in space with no gravity doing flips on the space station 😂. Knowing we’ve never even made it to Outer earth orbit. It’s just entertaining to see stuff like this now, and I realized how they’ve brainwashed us as children with movies like this. There is no space I know that’s sounds crazy to someone who is indoctrinated to believe in it. I was once you. Do your own research.
Did they have to make it a spider tho? A snake would've been tolerable at least Welp guess I can't watch...
I thought this was Project Hail Mary! Really good book.
It’s giving that one episode of Love Death and Robots (coincidentally also distributed by Netflix) where the spider lady lets people live out their dying fantasies…
What song is in the first half of the trailer? I can’t find it anywhere
Who thinks this stuff up ?
So this takes place after No Way Home?
Seems kind of slow.
It's just me or Spaceman looks like it's based on "Love Death and Robots Season 1- ep: Beyond the Aquila Rift".  Im here for it
Looks boring af.
It seems the rights films for theaters are going to streamers and the right films for streamers are going to theaters.
Wtf did saw that creature scared the hell out of me😳
Adam sander Is the White J cole.
The animal sounds like David from Prometheus
This looks like a ripoff of Andy Weir's book "Project Hail Mary," right down to the creepy, friendly spider creature.
Ok i would like to watch
absolutely not!
Six months in isolation? Those are rookie numbers, champ... ya gotta pump those up!
Dramatic Sandler, Let’s go!
i feel like this gonna be like eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
i can watch this free online
Calling it now. My guess is he never is in space
Why does it got to be a spider!? Burn the ship!!!
And then Erick Rowan saves the day
What song is playing in the beginning?
That spider would freak me out bro I don’t get this movie but love Adams stuff enough to watch this lol
Does Sandler have an Oscar? He’s about to
Space Spider Therapy with The Water Boy
first Echo Night : Beyond , and now this ? what is it with Moonlight Sonata and space colonies..
Glad this is finally coming out I got the privilege to watch this on the preview club really great movie
THis looks so fire
calling it now, the wife died before he went to space. And hes planning on dying out there to join her
Adam Sandler is hugely underrated accord people just think he is the funny man he has great ability that has never been shown
So you think I’m skinny??!!??
My worst nightmare. Stuck in a space capsule with any kind of spider…never mind a giant talking one. 😱Jeez. Look forward to watching it tho.
Sorry but I’m not watching this   Couldn’t even finish the trailer.  But probably a good movie that I have to miss
It’s an official selection of the Berlin Film Festival but it’s only on Netflix?
buzzin for this
isn't this like the second time we sent adam to space?
As much as I love his dramatic roles, his core fans including myself like him for his comedy movies, you know the movies everyone hates "thats my boy" "zohan" "bleended, the do over... I really hope he does more feel good comedies since Stiller and Carrey have pretty much retried. There are barely any good non politically correct comedies.
Song name???plz
No Idea what is going on but I'm totally down.
great movie for people who has arachnophobia
Cant wait to see where rob is in the film haha
Thankfully Summer brokered a peace between the telepathic spider race and humans. Too bad about the ice cream though.
Goosebumps 😱😶‍🌫️
Unbelievable we have 2024 and people still believe "sPaCe" is Real...  Some smart ass once told me "If u dont believe sh*t , why dont u go out there by your self to find out first hand...?" And so I did ...................... Read More
Emotional support spider. So cute like a chocolate labrador!
What is the song
Wtf did i just watch....
Thankfully not a Rob Schnieder in sight
The conspiracy theorist in me wonders if they made the creature a spider in order to make any productions of "Project Hail Mary" look like copycat projects
Well time to get over my fear of spiders for the Sandman
Who else has arachnophobia and will struggle to watch this 😭
Isabella Rossellini....When I was a kid, I whacked off to her like a demented chimpanzee for days on end. Good times.
you go where i go and i go where you go WHERE I GO YOU GO I AM YOU 1:38
It kinda reminds me of Andy Weir's Hail Mary novel, in which an solo human astronaut and an alien are forced to collaborate to save their respective worlds. I strongly recommand it if you liked The Martian
A dream that is to far from my reach
cant wait to see who kevin james plays
I don’t really like Sandler comfy movies but his drama movies are great. Reign over me was a great movie, this one should be great also
Glad I never killed spiders and always put them outside. So when I go to space, the space Aragog will take pity on my soul.
The nost ibteresting part of rhis trailer is trying to work out why he's wearing the Czech Republic flag? He doesn't sound Czech to me.
Holy crap 2:14
Wow these script writers must be doing lots of shrooms or something. Whatever it is I like it!😂
Gotta say, that is new
It's really worthwhile Adam Sandler in drama is almost like Robin Williams (and Aragog is almost like AI from Space Odyssey but the protagonist)
Lets GOOOOOOO,
Another Israeli genocidal Yahud on the screens !
what is the beginning song
Ooh this is giving me inception vibes when he said something about her thoughts coming to reality
Yes its just another accident on station 69 😂😂😂
all right i'm convinced. will watch.
Blockbuster Already
I hate spiders
I'm watching it on Berlinale in a couple of weeks. Very excited!
wtf
Adam Sandler is the best when he acts out a serious character
Looks great
I just finished the "Spaceman of Bohemia" before finally this trailer. I'M SOLD!!!
To me, I know Adam Sandler in the funniest movies with the funniest roles, I can never watch movies where he’s serious and possibly could die, those movies I just get depressed
So did they rip off the story written by Andy Wier called “Hail Mary?”
They say isolation in jail/prison is inhumane. It will break you and I've seen some crazy loud mouth mawfs come out of isolation quiet as a mouse because they didn't want to go back. Imagine being in space by yourself.
The flag on his arm is of Czech Republic, if anyone's wondering. Can't wait till March 1st!
I have always been a fan of his comedy movies... So I'm not sure whether I would watch this...
This looks great but can we stop with the way younger female partners trope? Like at least make Sandler's partner a more realistic age gap, like in their 40s or something.
Just like Uncut Gems and Hustle, Robert "Bobby" Boucher Jr. is doing well as an actor.
Y'all know that the space programs people are good at choosing people who can actually be isolated for long periods of time before losing their entire mind and talking to spiders after a month, right?
I can already see the ending. He’s not in space.
Nice a movie to put me to sleep
Adam Sandler in a serious role. I love it
"Billy Madison 2: Graduation"
Looks like it is inspired from the love+death+robot episode called ‘Beyond the Aquarift’ 🤔💛
Lol, did they steal some conceptions of Andy Weir's plot of Project Hail Mary?
Wtf 😂
Spiderman
typyčo
Rocketman was better.
They need to release this in cinemas too so Adam can get nominated for an Oscar
looks good and honestly dont ever trust a spider something tells me that thing is deceiving and not friendly .
Spider voice would cure my astronaut insomnia.
I would only watch this if the spider was voiced by Rob Schneider and pooped on Sandler.
What's going on with the hyper realistic enlightened animals trope? I literally just watched A24's new trailer "Tuesday" with a similar vibe but it was a girl with cancer and a parrot...
This looks fresh on Adam, story also looks in fantasy. A step away from dad jokes. Interesting😮
If this story is going where Beyond The Aquila Rift went, then I'm out.
Doesn't this remind u of interstellar?
Hope he stays off Earth.
Reminds me of an episode from Love, Death, Robots. Hit like if you know what I am talking about.
Reminds me of Moon(2009) but with sandman and a spider.  I’m here for it
Man, they took project hail Mary in a different direction.
Grown Ups 3 has taken a turn, people. A big left turn.
If you read the book then you know it's gonna be GOOD
Why is the alien a spider
So the Project Hail Mary movie looks a bit different, but I think Sandler can pull it off.
He finally made the movie adaptation of his song "Station Sixty-Nine" 😃
Thought this was going to be based on Andy Weir's 'Project Hail Mary' for a hot second... Bummer.
I am not sure I would like this one.  It feels like Sandler is trying to steal the idea of a space journey with a spider alien......which is already in the works.  They are ripping off 'Project Hail Mary' and I don't like it when production companies duplicate someone else's ideas and create 'less than' good pre-reproductions.
it just goes on and on
Come on people be forreal. Looks pointless, still gonna watch it tho
*cough* Love, death and robots. *cough* beyond the Aquila rift. *cough*
Carey Mulligan is amazing no matter what she does.  And I don't need Sandler doing a Gravity re-tell.  I need Sandler strapped into a watercooler on his back making stupid faces at people.
Does anyone know who created the music??
WOW LETS ADAM THIS UP THERE
a spider? really are you people out of ideas?
this looks really dumb, but I will steal it from you just the same
Chornobyl, not Chernobyl. Your transliteration is incorrect. In Ukrainian it's "Чорнобиль", not "Чернобиль"
I wouldn't be surprised at this film being highly rated. Adam Sandler's made some funny flicks, a couple of decent dramatic ones...but this time, I think he's going to surprise everyone.
This look frickin hilarious
Well that took an abrupt left turn I was not expecting.
Adam Sandler IN SPAAAAAAAACE!!!
Sand man as hilarious as ever
Adam is a great dramatic actor.he just uses his friends for the goofy movies
It's project ave Maria
This looks good af is Sandler finally going to get an Oscar?
Oh god why’d it have to be a spider?
"Stop looking at me, spider"
Can't wait to see Aragog again!
Glad adam is getting into more drama. He has good acting chops. I enjoyed uncut gems.
This reminds me of the book Hail Mary
Anyone going to call out adam sandler for basically stealing the idea from "beyond the aquila rift" from Love death and robots?
That’s Paul Dano ! He is highly underrated.
I'm sorry. If I saw an 80 pound spider inside my space ship. I'm jettisoning us both out the airlock as the ship is on fire.
This film from my personal perspective just watching the trailer hit me hard because it really shows what depression and loneliness can do to a person…most people I know can simply write it off as weakness but once/if you ever experience the the mental and or emotional solitude that comes with loneliness you would never utter those words again
This film seems like it has the potential to be a huge emotional connection for people that are dealing with loneliness and its demons, kind of like Max fighting Vecna in Stranger Things, it portrayed how one would possibly deal with crippling anxiety, I cant wait to see this film and its message. Love Sandler.
Actually looks like a solid Netflix movie for once.. Would be nice to see it in theater, where good movies are best watched. Another movie that'll likely just be lost a year after release never to be remembered again.
You’d have to be totally fearless to be trapped in that container with Adam Sandler.
are we out of remaking movies already? we've made it full circle.
So we’re supposed to believe a dude in Sandler’s shape could make it to space?
Thank you 🙏 ADAM
I WAS EXCITED..TIL I SEEN IT WAS NETFLIX.. NO THANKS..
This looks good. Think we are going to get Adam at his best.
He is alone on a ship and giant spider starts talking to him. lol weird.
Damn Sandman
Adam in a serious dramatic role is a fantastic actor. I believe his best performance was in a movie called "Reign Over Me."
😮
Why didn't they give him a PS2 with some games.
Adam a 🐐
We need more of dramatic Adam sandler
This looks really similar to Project Hail Mary. Minus the mental health angle.
man there exist song from babylon zoo , spaceman why producer didnt used in this movie beyond me.
Paul Dano as the spider is such an interesting and exciting choice! He's great in every role, and I think his soothing voice will put a lot of audiences at rest despite the huge spider on screen.   Also, really happy to see Sandler doing another serious role - he's great at wounded, vulnerable characters.
👎👎
mushrooms will be consumed
Honestly,this looks like a next gen video game and I want it.
Pennywise in his true form, if he wasn't evil
This looks amazing but what the hell Netflix getting all sorts of wild movie pitches in the corporate office.
For once adam sandler gets a real movie and not some horrible joke. His skill can finally be used and not wasted.
Oh Jesus. So if we really do get a “project Hail Mary” movie, everyone will say it’s a knock off. 😒
Isnt this basically love, Death And Robots: Beyond The Aquila Rift ?
Looks surprisingly good!
Well sandler is getting older so...
Voice: I did not intend to frighten you, skinny human. *along came a giant spider* Sandler: Yeah well, ya failed!  NOW THAT'S A HUGE B!TCH.
The woman is extremely annoying even though it's just a trailer, I can't imagine how annoying she'll be in the actual movie.
The book it’s based on is incredible too, can’t wait to see the film
It's from a book, Spaceman of Bohemia, by Jaroslav Kalfar. I started it in French, really liked it, but didn't finish it since I'm learning the language. Wishing I had continued to finish it
Interesting concept but the alien being a giant spider is... kinda strange?
"I don't like spiders" Ron Weasley
whoa
Why'd it have to be a spider? Could've been anything else
I have never known Adam Sandler to do anything but comedies
I love the part where he gets called "Skinny Human" you know he asked that to be added.
Why a spider?
Seems like a slight ripoff of Project Hail Mary. Still looks good, though.
Hello Netflix There will be berlin two, the movie is great, so I would be interested Thanks
Wow Drew Barrymore looks different in 2024
Should’ve been Daniel Day-Lewis so he could slap the spider.
Must see this
Badass 🔥
Spider bro is real
Dude never misses.
Would of been better if he’s not just hallucinating a spider but instead a real big headed compassionate alien found him to help him with his loneliness and work through his problems
Whyyyy did it have to be a huge friggin spider? 😩 I love Sandler in comedic, animated, and dramatic roles but I just can’t do it, I’ll have to read the full plot on wiki instead
people who think adam Sandler is the goat ⬇
The alien thing looks so fake and stupid.
Reign over me, the Cobbler, Uncut Gems. Some of his rarest yet best work. Im excited
By why a spider... no thanks
wow fascinating Adam Sandler work... just wow
More propaganda for the masses.
Yes... I want movie.
Adam Sandler eh who would have thunk it, guys a good serious actor
doesn't hear sandler go "Agoobadoobiedoe": I DON"T LIKE THIS ANYMORE.
he floats off into space and thats the end
A reimagining of Project Hail Mary?
Just because of the music I fell in love with the film, I'm addicted to it!!! Can anyone tell me the name? ❤❤❤😮
ADAM SANDLER IS THE GOAT OF MOVIES hands down no debate 💯 the man iconic
Who would have thought the telepathic spiders from Rick and Morty would get a live-action origin film.
wait, an adam sandler serious role movie ??? i really need to see this
lol
That’s Paul Danos voice right?! Love him. Also, Sandler deserves more dramatic roles like this, people underestimate his range.
I have to wait till March to re-subscribe to Netflix
This film seems like it has the potential to be a huge emotional connection for people that are dealing with loneliness and its demons, kind of like Max fighting Vecna in Stranger Things, it portrayed how one would possibly deal with crippling anxiety, I cant wait to see this film and its message. Love Sandler.
If you're intrigued by this trailer, do yourself a favor and read the book Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky! You won't regret it!
You just saved me 2 hours of my life by putting the whole movie the preview
Chimera spiders....
I just hope the alien is actually something real and not out of his illusion/hallucinations.
Looking forward to watching the undubbed czech version!
Hits home being lonely gonna be good watch this
movies ruined for people with arachnophobia. actually annoying
I will say this I’m open minded to the new movies that Adam Sandler is making ….it doesnt always have to be an about comedy …..sometimes you need to expand that ….cant be telling the same old stories to this …looking forward to it and Aragog to from Harry Potter ❤❤❤❤😂😂
Damn this look good af
I was so excited for this movie but I dont think I can watch it, that spider would give me nightmares! 😢
Man ripping off the last fleet lmao   Spider aliens for the win
Ripping off Andy Weir's "Project Hail Mary"
Adam Sandler needs to do more of these kinds of movies.  He's much better as a dramatic actor, IMO.
If Peter Stormare (from Armageddon) played in this movie, it will make a hit of the century.
What is up with these cerebral talking birds/arachnids in films this year?
Hardwell spaceman have to be the original soundtrack for this one.
Anyone know the music that starts at 1:08
This has a feel of” beyond the Aquila rift”
That spider makes my head itch
🤩🔥can't wait!!🔥🤩
I wish he would make another good movie instead of this stuff he’s been making for like the past few years
This looks great, and I hope it does well, but I am way more excited for the Project Hail Mary movie with Ryan Gosling!
The Spider kinda talks like how Dr. Manhattan narrated his new birth.
Rocketman?
Serious Adam Sandler. Which more often than not is top notch Adam Sandler.
That spider reminded me of project hail mary
Looks terrible.  It's no Spanglish.
"I am afraid I cannot do that Sandler." -a talking Spider from Harry Potter
Why did it have to be a giant space spider 🕷!😱
I'm a spaceman, got a rocket on my back. Spaceman, oh I'm raving like a maniac!
A spider thou, come one man
Did anybody else have Adam Sandler Spider Space movie on their apocalyptic bingo card?
oh shit, this is Serious Sandler not the Goofy Adam, I am excited love it when he does serious roles
Why in SciFi movies do they always choose the idiots to go on billion dollar space missions ?
Give Astronauts a gaming PC
I miss adam sandler when he used to say "He called the Shit, Poop!"
Why can't it be follow the butterflies? 😭
This looks like such a BOP!
first non shit program ive seen on netflix
Stupidest sht I seen all year...and the year just begun wtf Adam sandler
Wow looks really.. Big a$$ spider im out!!!
I love adam but this looks lame.
wait wait wait ^^~
This movie will make sense 👌
Out of all the things why did the alien have to be a super boring done-do-death spider?! 😫 What ever hopes I had for this film were instantly wiped out. I can think of one reason why it's a spider, but I'm still already bored 😩
Swear to go Adam Sandler is going to get an Oscar sooner or later.
This sucks.
Return of the Sandman
Hopefully it’s just the trailer because this looks like trash
Aragog ?
Looking forward to this.
So is this just Beyond the Aquila Rift: The Movie?
Trailer looks really good.
One of those movies where things dont make sense. Bet spider and woman in the forest isnt real either. It all means something nothing more lolb
Urgh this looks terrible. What is it with Adam Sandler managing to be in all the worst movies? He lost it when he got too old to pull off constant fart jokes.
Skinny human? The alien knows about egos.
Very interesting. I have grown up(no pun intended) up with Adam Sandler and have ALWAYS known him to be a COMEDIAN. It's kind of unnerving to see him in a drama/thriller. Will be interesting to see Sandler in a whole different genre. Kind of like when Jim Carrey was in "The Number 23. I know that WE, as  viewers tend to pigeon-hole actors into a certain character or that they only belong in a certain genre. I try to keep an open mind going into movies now. He might surprise us with a SUPURB performance 👍🏻🙏
Selling the space lie...Typical...
That isn't my cup of tea by the look of it. Shame as well because I love a good space movie.
Well I will be tuning in
Anyone getting vibes that there was at least some Project Hail Mary inspiration here..
I already know just from the trailer and the actors this will be a 10/10 movie!
I love how some of the best performances of the last couple of decades came from individuals that made us laugh when we were kids, be it Jim Carrey, Bryan Cranston, Jamie Foxx, Robin Williams, Adam Sandler, etc which supports my theory that the most talented entertainers are in fact comedians because of their versatile skills, and not the one-dimensional singers or actors that receive all the glory and fame.
It's something different from the usual space movies. I will give it a go. Seems good. Hopefully it doesn't turn into a Mary Sue as Adam seems to approach it differently. Fingers crossed
Yeah, space plus spiders, not a good combination. I will not watch this movie, definitely not, not even close to it.
People talking about uncut gem like it’s his first drama performance.  Click was tear jerking. It was straight forward life lesson movie but he deliver that perfectly.  Reign on me, imo, one of the best depiction of a broken man, under circumstances. He did that perfectly as well.  he’s not a bad actor, never was. he’s just in bad movie and, those too,has reasons for it to be made.
Looks incredible 😊
Love to see a Czech author get adapted into a major film like this. Shoutout Jaroslav Kalfař 🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿
Love Sandler and how Paul Dano is getting even more roles now, he's in almost every new upcoming thing.
Who does Kevin James play?
Reminds me of a episode of love death+robots. Seems exactly like it.
In my opinion his movies have not been really that good since joining Netflix
So excited for this
It's so rare to watch Adam's more serious movie like this
lol.. a large talking spider in space??  looks like the dumbest shit ever. wow.
exited too see sandler in a not comedy looks interesting
He is shooting for an Oscar one more time. I hope he gets nominated.
Looks stupid
Me: Oh, shit! This looks interesting as hell.  Spider shows up  Me: *scrolls*
Adam Sandler is so good in drana roles, he doesn't get enough recognition for them. Also as someone who loves spiders, love the creature design
Project Hail Mary
i have arachnophobia how tf am i supposed to watch this shit
Vengaaaaaa!!!!
Yes! An Adam Sandler Interstellar! haha
Chernobyl was spectacular! I can't wait to see this!
arachnophobia warning would have been crazy appreciated 😬😂
this just gives the vibe he’s gonna die
Big fan of Adam Sandler, I love all his movies but I HATE spiders so this one might be a pass
Reminds me of "Beyond The Aquila Rift" Episode of Love, Death + Robots. Very very similar elements.
I liked the part where Adam Sandler said "It's spacin' time" truly a movie of all time.
They need to get the electronic callboy song
Wow this looks amazing!
Yup
I hope I'm not the only one aware of the wink to Ad Astra in the soundtrack? (both have epic versions of Moonlight Sonata, mvt 1). Anyways, anybody knows this Moonlight Sonata version?
That was a wandering spider one big enough to never want to see
I’m definitely arachnophobic 😂 but I’ll watch because Adam Sandler is amazing!! ❤
So excited about this movie!!
Sha da ba da ba doooo!!!! Stop looking at me Swan!!!
My arachnophobia will never accept him as my companion even.😢
uzay adam
I LOVE Adam Sandler in serious roles. I hope he does more dramatic films going forward.
I am terrified of this alien spider!!!
Anything with Sandler in a dramatic role is a yes. Also, Paul Dano is an actor's actor.
Fun fact, that spider is Paul Dano 😂
Do grown ups 3 and murder mystery 3
It's an Adam Sandler movie?  So Jennifer Aniston is the spaceship, Drew Barrymore is the spider, Rob Schneider is the helmet, Nick Swardson is the nebula, Steve Buscemi is Sandler's beard, and Adam Sandler is....Adam Sandler.
Why a spider 🕷️
So this is the quality of movies we get nowadays
Space Spiders took Jimi Hendrix, Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, John Candy, Chris Farley & Lindsay Lohan, now they need Adam Sandler to help them fight the cosmic evil.
This is exactly what I want from the Sandman, post-Uncut Gems. Double down on that drama, he’s got the range.
I’m sure that’s gonna be a terrific movie. More space propaganda fueling the dying flame that is space and the globe . What a stupid concept. A ball earth that is clearly flat and stationary. Space that is admittedly fake . I find this hilarious and ridiculous. Sad as well that people are so brainwashed into buying into really stupid things like a spinning space ball while all the water at rest is flat and level. The surface of Earth is 70% water . Water at rest is always flat and level. Always. Level. Level is flat . Welcome to the real workd
adam in a serious movie
name of song that starts on 1:00? thank youuu
That's a brave font choice.
I saw the Czech flag in the thumbnail and was like: "What the hell, that can't be real"😂. Greetings from Czechia!
see i told you adam sandler was out of this world !!!!
Deserves to be released in theaters
Now all we need is the song  “Spaceman” to play in this movie and it will be complete.
Watching this just waiting for the Adam Sandler joke to come...and Aragog appears. LOL!
Esto va a ser increíble
A talking spider ? Lol looks interesting though
funny jewish person.
Definitely not a movie you want to watch high.
Didnt Tom Hanks do this already in Castaway?
Ok, did it have to be a space spider though???
Where is the comedy ? The jokes!.. Oh  .. I think landing on the moon is.. the joke..😅
I believe Adam Sandler signed some kind of contract or Netflix owns him for the rest of his life.  Like why why did he do that to all of his fans Happy Madison movies were awesome until they went netflix garbage
thought we getting a space movie, but it's gonna be a love story, again
One of my top all time favorite actors
so when’s this drop
Why does this look so good!?
TELL ME ABOUT SPIDERMAN!!! I KNOW YOU KNOW HIS SECRETS!!! TURN ME INTO SPIDERMAN!!!
WOW…. This looks horrible :/.
Holy smokes, this movie looks so good. I love Adam Sandler comin in saying " I can make academy award winners if you want me to stop making comedies" bro can act like crazy.
Not how I saw Children of Time being adapted, but ok.
There’s no way he makes it home btw
Oh my goodness, I’m so excited for this project. It looks amazing cinematically and sound wise. Just Adam Sandler is a lead for this role was an amazing choice. This might just be today’s current spot for eternal sunshine.❤❤❤
I feel like when Adam Sandler pass away, this will be one of his movies people will remember for generations.
Sorry Adam Sandler I have seen one too many of your movies... and after all that I have an unbreakable reaction in my psyche to the name "ADAM SANDLER" where my eyelids start to close and i get very very drowsy.  I now cannot avoid the thought: "ADAM SANDLER = BORING".  But clearly it's too late for me now, all the rest of you, you still have time,  SAVE YOURSELVES...
Space is fake
NEW NETFLIX PRODUCT CONSUME NEXT PRODUCT
Anybody know how to find the music used in the trailer.
For those that read "Project Hail Mary," it's good to see our friend Rocky again.
when does it release?
BS space propaganda movie. No such thing as a vacuum existing next to an atmo. Space is fake
Can wait 😊
Still trying to brainwash the public with this fake space bs and most believe it. Absolute nonsense
wow
Another Nutflix loser.
Where are you Jodie Foster?. Not in this movie it seems.
I dig the Czech vibes.
😭😭😭😭is that a fkg spider 😭😭😭
Nah.....
startin off this year right with aliens 😂🔥 have a feeling theres gonna be a lot of em this year
This looks like a feature-length version of Love Death Robot's "Beyond the Aquila Rift" episode.
Looks shite
Sorry, I can't stop seeing him beat up Bob Barker and singing as Opera Man. Good luck, Adam!
I swear, Adam Sandler is better as a drama actor than as a comedian.
is this the end of his comedy films. i hope not
So, South Parks Catholics were right about there being a Giant Spider everyone worships? 😂😂
He’s such a sell out.
YEAAAAAAAH CZECH REPUBLIC MENTIONED ŘŘŘŘŘŘŘŘŘŘŘŘŘŘŘŘŘŘ
of course space spiders....
GAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Adam Sandler still throwing us jewels mate, can't think of a time I was disappointed. Can't wait to watch.
Adam sandler?!?!?! Will Rob Sneider be Mission Control?
As long as it stays accurate to physics it should be a good movie
I don't know about this one.   that gem one he did sucked.
This looks so mid 😂
Is this movie a metaphor for a mentally disturbed astronaut like Canada's Julie Payette who wreaked havoc as Canada's head of state - it's governor general?
Everybody saying "Good for Adam" in comments. PEOPLE THE BIGGER THING IS THE GIANT F@*$(#^N SPIDER.  Me: "I really want to go home".  Giant Spider: "Hi, I'm here to help" Me: Initiates self destruct.
Why go to space if you're going to have instant regret? Tired of "Mentally unstable" spaceman trope. Also, big ol NOPE to giant spider.
This move looks good Adam Sandler never disappoints
😳😳
the alien's voice sounds like Jared Leto's voice. it would be nice to have him here!
Yeah no thank you.
"THIS ISN'T YOUR HOME! SPIDER! YOU NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOUR HOME!"
Sandler really loves piling on the syrup. Hard pass.
....... SO ................Beyond the Aquila Rift?
Not gonna lie, I clicked on this trailer thinking it would be a comedy! This looks really good though!
I missed this guy
I remember meeting Adam Sandler and the first thing bro said was "Coumbaya my lord" its stuck with me everytime I go to work "coumbaya my lord" everytime I leave the stove "coumbaya" everytime I see an Adam Sandler flick you better believe "coumbaya"
wth did i just watch
This looks pretty good 👍 I'm gonna watch this
นั้นเป็นแมงมุมที่น่ารักที่สุดเท่าที่เคยเห็นเลย😊
Has anyone else read Project Hail Mary” by Andy Weir?
Looks interesting... 🤔
Somehow Spider not played by Kevin James
Please, Netflix. Make this a theatrical release. At least here in the Czech Republic. People would love it! ❤
As a Czech person, it’s so odd to see Adam Sandler playing one of us. Can’t wait to see it!
Adam Sandler in a serious movie. Pass
This the year of Space Movies?
I don't wanna get traumatized again
Adam sandler would be a good isaac clark for dead space
Man misses emotional and vengeful wife
reminds me of "what dreams may come" with robin williams
Scuba Steve Damn You!
Yay! Another movie where it looks like Adam Sander is trying!  Whenever he does that, the movie is typically really good.  Looking forward to this!
WTF a spider in space??
Definitely not the real trailer 😂
Looks good. He should stick with serious roles. It suits him better now
Ew. Arachnid. Lost my interest right away. Arachnophobia is too strong for this
This looks amazing
This looks good af
InterSandler
Why does it have to be a big spider?! 😓
Oh God that tarantula is a nope for me 😮😅
Adam is awesome but I really like him in the comedy movies.
Omg he looks so funny floating like that 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Adam Sandler does it again !! 🤣🤣
Too put off by spiders 😂 I can't watch the movie
It’s awfully cold in outer space tonight…
Can't wait
Thank God it's not a cash grab rubbish movie like his last 5 or so films
Got it, Space Spider Therapist to the rescue for a man known for screaming while playing golf.
i need the background song to be real
Now imagine those planning to *travel in space for 7 years* to get to Mars—a rock with no breathable air. They get there and they cannot celebrate by going to a nearby bar or even go be with family and friends. They're [stuck] on a rock! No, thank you. I can assure you that no one will go to Mars and it'll be a miracle making it to the end of 2024 without another world war and the use of a nuke. 🚀
Why is the wife 20 years younger than the male lead. This needs to stop.
Another trailer I had to stop before it ruined any hope of me watching the final film.
As a Czech dude i must say poggers.
Bro did drugs with a spider
Chopin and Beethoven composed this 😄
Looks freaking good. 👏👀
"Do not be afraid"  A sentence every angel had to announce when revealing itself to humans in the bible.
Is this the Station 69 movie?
Songs’ name?
Hes come a long long way from nudie magazine day !
Bearded Sandler = Great movie.
Whoa. The trailer was like most space movies, but then LSD was suddenly thrown into the mix  This looks VERY interesting!
It’s said that Adam picks his movies because of where it’s being shot, going to a place where he’d want to go on vacation.   Turns out he wanted a trip to actual space this time
I'm a huge sci-fi fan and a huge Adam Sandler fan.  But this just looks terrible.  I guess we'll see...
Perfectly good trailer ruined by the cliche music at the end.  Sandler is a really cool actor to watch.  Was so gutted he missed out with uncut gems, it's up there with the great performances.  This movie looks mega.
is the spider supposed to be a nod to Project Hail Mary?
nice
that looks awesome
This sounds a lot like Project Hail Marry
Lol
This looks fire 🔥
Comedy Gold
Be good to see how he does in a serious role
damn does anybody know the amazing music name in the bg in 0:15
Boring
Lol 😂 wtf giant spider in space …. ‘Not like this..’
This feels very avenegers-esque
This looks good !
This looks absolutely incredible! Netflix, PLEASE release this one in theaters like you’ve done with a select few movies in the past (like “All Quiet on the Western Front”, “Marriage Story”, “The Irishman”, “Glass Onion”, “Pinocchio”, “The Midnight Sky”, “Mank”, etc). I would gladly go see this, probably multiple times, if it was playing in a commercial movie theater near me.
Iam finally going to watch a Adam Sandler movie, it been more than a decade, they got me with that spider 😮
Looks good, but after the spider came in I will definitely not watch this movie. 😅
My jaw is on the floor
This looks hilarious!!!
This movie trailer is a perfect example why our astronauts need WEAPONS of some kind like what are you supposed to do if a giant sentient space tarantula rolls up on you like this?
A trailer that leaves me asking  What is this movie about
Looks great! Carey Mulligan is so mid on many fronts... please move on from her Hollywood
this seems like it could be another movie that showcases just how amazing an actor Adam Sandler can be sometimes
I miss Adam Sandler doing comedy movies, and I used to love watching happy Gilmore, eight crazy nights. But at least he loves to now take on drama roles and I respect that.😊
Yup... I'll watch this
Let’s go sandler
Im calling it now. he fucks the spider
Hmm, this makes me want sloppy joes. I don’t know. I already got some hoagies and grinders made.   Navy beans. Navy beans.
This kind of reminds me of Episode 7 Season 1 from Love Death and Robots.
and the oscar goes to: ADAMMmm
This feels like a remake of the "Love,Death,Robots" episode...
Still waiting for my waterboy sequel 😠 😡 👿 😤
Was the Do Not be afraid a Blibical reference
This looks terrible. I think this genre is exhausted at this point, and it’s been done so much better so many times. A talking spider? Really?
AAAhhh do you have to be on drugs to watch this movie ????
Adam Sandler… meet Rock bottom Rock bottom… meet Adam Sandler
wtf is this.
I was like wait.. is this based of hail mary ? They are very very similar 😅   2 different books with spider talking to man in space apparently lol
Reign over me was probably the first serious movie I saw. But Click did the same and hit hard at the end
Looks really good! This is a real departure for Adam Sandler!!
สุดยอด
Adam Sandler isn’t underrated. Y’all are stupid😂
This is Cobweb 2.
I like the old Adam Sandler
Looks amazing
skinny human?
The Miami Mall aliens were real.  The govt covered it up with 100 plus police and federal vehicles.  Do a deep dive and you will see.
REALLY hope this isn't like Gravity In that a bunch of this was just all in his imagination.
def looking forward to watching this. i always thought sandman was a great actor in his serious roles 💪🏻
This has Hail Mary vibes to it. A book written by Andy Weir. The author of the book made famous by the movie adaptation, The Martian with Matt Damon.
Space is fake and gay
Netflix le wokisme qui ne cache pas je pense 100% de la direction de Netflix est soit homosexuelle soit malade car il y a de bonnes séries de très bonnes même mais à un moment il faut qu il y ait de l  homosexualité ou du transgenre du coup si vous avez des ados fuyez Netflix.... Netflix ne veut que la des truction de notre société  .... Netflix est le pendant médiatique de toutes les idéologies extrêmes qui détruisent notre société....honte à ses dirigeants
Howard is going to space again
Now THIS is a Sandler project I want to see!    As has already been mentioned, he absolutely SHINES in dramatic roles with the right scripts.
Nope,,,an emotional woke astrounat controlled by a feminist wife
“Why spiders? Why couldn't it have been follow the butterflies?” - Ronald Weasley
Wow, America needed more images of depression.  Good idea.
This looks like that one episode from love death robots
CZECHIA MENTIONED RAAAH 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
a spider?? a....space spider?? that would be just my luck if i traveled into the depths of space and am greeted by a gah dang spider
Czech citizen here, this looks incredible! Iam really looking forward to see Adam Sandler in the lead role! ps. co to kurva je abstinence rahhh
This looks pish.
czech republic mentioned AYAYA
punch drunk love, uncut gems and now this. i love it
Like Movies Apollo 13 & Gravity
This reminds me Project Hail Mary from Any Weir
Spaceman=Solaris 3.0 with Adam Sandler loosing it
I was honestly not expecting this. Definitely going to give this movie a try!
I usually give every movie a chance specially if it's got Adam Sandler in it. But on this one .no thanks
I just can't believe that Sandler in this movie is czech 😀 but maaan this accually looks very cool
Patches the spider 🕷
Did it really have to be a big ass spider
Nice to see Aragog being featured in upcoming movies!
why does it have to be a spider??? 🥲😶
Spider from movie 'Enemy' gets a second chance.
meh
This doesn't feel like Punch Drunk Love or Reign Over me Sandler.
Netflix shit.....
Why is this just a knockoff of Andy Weir’s Project Hail Mary???
Boycott this Zionist
welp. looks like the arachniphobes of the world wont be seeing this movie.
This looks weird, I can't wait.
Adam Sandler in another great dramatic roles which suits him so as comedy films also Netflix studio paying Adam Sandler a lot of money for he's films the last dramatic role I saw Adam Sandler in uncut gems playing the jewellery store owner with a gambling problem great film back in 2019 spaceman looks like a great movie coming March 1st on Netflix another great dramatic role by Adam Sandler it's similar to cast away storyline with Adam Sandler character using a spider or some sort animal to guide him for earth stuck stranded in space and the space shuttle has problems with he's wife looks like going to better than Matt Damon the Martian looking forward to watching this movie spaceman on Netflix march 1st going to be a great movie by Adam Sandler
I mean does it have to be a giant spider though
Why the alien 👽 gotta be a spider 🕷️ I hate spiders 🕷️
Jesus Christ! This looks worse than Jack & Jill 😆 🤣
IS THIS JUST KNOCK OFF PROJECT HAIL MARY?????
A long way from Saturday Night Live.
Will there be some variety of Station Sixty-Nine involved? 🤨
Is this finally Adam Sandlers break away from Comedy that gets him into more serious roles? Lets go!
180 days?  Cute
Jeff the spider lol
Why a spider out of all things
Stupid
Seems he might've traveled beyond the Aquila rift.
Anyone know where I can find the music used
looks ass
Damn
👽❤
soo who does kevin james play in this one
Adam Sandler in a dramatic role.  Wow.  Good for him.  He is versatile.  This film looks bizarre yet still interesting.
Predictable.  Looks unoriginal.
Project Hail Mary but the Main character failed to keep his sanity
This looks sad in the way that Eternal Sunshine is sad.
Isabella Rosellini is “71 years old” now. Age she claimed to be in Death Becomes Her
This is the evidence of the dramatic acting power of Comedians. It's hard for a serious actor to do comedy, but for a comedian to be dramatic and serious is a walk in the park.
YES!!!! Love Adam's roles outside of Comedy too! I'lll be watching this
Swiaa army man............. meet Adam Sandler
Hmmm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah... the movie has a bunch of interpretive imagery and dialogue and the ending will be inconclusive and left open to interpretation. Yawn.
One of the worst parts about a life such as this is no pum pum.
comedy is harder than a serious roll so i think he got this. looks like a lighter version of interstellar
This is reminding me of that Black Mirror episode from the most recent season 👀
The spider's name is probably Aragog, and he probably talked about Spaceman to a tall gentlemen named Hagrid.
Old Story with a new hat, Looks good
When did Sandler start giving a shit again and pulled out of this slump that inflicted a sheer endless abomination of painfully unfunny flicks on us? Judging the trailer, I'm cautiously optimistic that he might actually give us something good. Go Adam.
"EVERYTHING THAT BEGINS MUST END.............. I'M NOT ALLOWING THAT!!!!" 💪
Feeling like this idea was inspired by “Project: Hail Mary” by Andy Weir 😅😅
interesting
Me encantan estos maravillosos videos))))
I feel like this will be a movie i dont understand😂
Anyone calling Adam Sandler underrated is an idiot. No one doubts this mans well rounded talent.
wow the edge of the solar system would only take roughly 6759 years to get to in the fastest man made space vehicle. Is this in the future where physics don't apply?
Cool looking movie and an interesting rendition of Moonlight Sonata
I was getting 'Project Hail Marry' vibes, am I right fellow Andy Weir readers out there?
The hardest thing for me to do is watch Adam play a serious role... Like...that's not him. He's comedy only. His name doesn't even sound right in anything serious. Yet now...now I'm stuck.  I've never wanted to see him play this role in this movie so bad in my life. I'm looking forward to it.
These trailers basically spoil the entire thing lmao
someone tell me where the music is from
I think it’ll have you wondering if the spider is real or something he created in his mind. I’ll definitely check this out
He's just chasing that Oscar at this point
Not what I expected when I hit the start button....but looks good
Calling it now, he has some kind of fear surrounding his wife and another fear of spiders - all this is in his head and the creature takes the form of a spider to represent his fears and how they can ultimately help him toward his goals… just a theory… a game theory
I think its very smart as spider representing our fears. Koala won't make it like that.
ADAM SANDLER AMONG US MOVIE
I can't take any movie seriously when I see Adam goofy self all I think of is Billy Madison and old timberland boots
very interesting, but why a spider?
Looks interesting
I liked it until aragog came.
Give this man an Oscar. He's raised multiple generations with laughter and heartfelt roles. The whole time he did that he brought his buddies up with him and maintained respect as a kind human. He is the Sandman
Seems like one of those Mr beast isolation challenges lol
CZ!
Lost me on the spider
Okay this is great but i legit shit myself when the spider showed up first time.
It's the guy from the basketball movie!
This is every other "I'm alone in space film...". But with Adam Sandler... The attention is out of this world
What do they identify as?  What are there Pronouns?
Uhhhhhh no
This seem like a chilling take on prolong space travel, but then I saw a monster spider and hmmm. It still looks pretty good.
Dr Spaceman
Once in a while, Adam Sandler flexes his "Oscar" muscle and every damn time I am shook
Finally a Sandler film not set in Hawaii
What patch is he wearing? More WEF, DEI B/S.
Adam Sandler is gunna do amazing in this  Anytime buddy gets a serious role he does amazing in it
Eldritch Therapist
Looks good but I don't do spiders
Why a spider, anything but a spider.
I would have shot myself out of the airlock if I saw a big ass talking spider on  my spaceship
This looks good!
Looks interesting, wish I wasn’t arachnophobic
Adam Sandler in space, let's go!
This is awfully similar to Andy Weir's "Hail Mary" 🤔 Not sure how I feel about that fact!
I’ll watch anything with Shelob in it.
Jo
I love the idea of adam Sandler playing more dramatic roles like this. His performance in Uncut Gems was outstanding
I never ever cared for Adam's comedies, they annoyed me more than anything. However this, like uncut gems, looks amazing.
bro this better not be them tryna tell us these interdimensional beings take forms like this when coming into our dimension
The song so settling what’s it called?
i seen adam sandler and I said say no more
yooo hooo. yabba dooo 🤙☝️
Bobby Boucher in space mama always said never trust alien because aliens the devil lol
I hope Adam Sandler and the spider get thier own spinoff series. A buddy cop show.
Lucas the Spider in space😃
He better sing space oddity in this
Ugh  Another defense mechanism based film  with delusions. Nobody wants to see Sandler in serious roles.
Actually a Sandman mocie that i might watch!
Interesting that there's a space spider movie with Project Hail Mary film adapt not too far off
😅😅😅
Good Netflix Space man | Official Trailer Good | Netflix
This March. Adam Sandler and a space spider save him from a nasty divorce
Grew up watching all the Happy Madison film's... Adam Sandler is one of my favorite actors 💯😎
Project Hail Mary????
So a Netflix movie about the jellyfish like alien we have been seeing? 🤔
It looks good af. But why does there have to be a giant spider..
At least we know that Rob Schneider and Steve Buscemi will be in the movie 😏.
First Adam Sandler movie I’m never gonna watch because of that spider lol
Jim carrey celebrated his 62 birthday in January 2024 with Jimmy Kimmel & Adam Sandler
Fan of adam sandlers movies but this one legit looks boring as shit lmao
This looks great. Unfortunately I am not going to be watching a big ass spider for that long
Is he really in space or is rhis about pychonauts??
DANG! Gonna need the big boot.
We're supposed to believe that 6 months by yourself does this to you? If it does, then this explains the pending divorce.
Notice how when any big movie about sci-fi displays aliens, they will almost never design them as the accounts we have with contactees (civil, military, etc.), like for example the tall nordics, the reptilians, the praying mantis, etc... it'll always be these whacky alien designs. I just think it's a hit and miss for so may of these movies.
Nice thing but why does it have to look like a spider........
🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
That looks really good
"Beyond the Aquila Rift"  love death and robots vibes
I CAN"T WAIT , I LOVE THE SANDMAN !!!!
How is the voice not Kevin James?
This guy constantly uses pedophile code words. He’s a Hollywood superstar. Do the maths. I loved Adam Sandler until I put the pieces together.
Was so easy for critics to shit on him for years, Give him a damn Oscar already, he’s earned it.
I thought this was Project Hail Mary  when the spider showed up. This looks good. Hope we get a Hail Mary movie too though
I already seen this movie.  He tells the spider to, "Get in the flask!"
Rip off of Project Hail Mary 😂😂😂
Shelob looking for work after Lord of the Rings.
Dude, I was avoiding this because I saw Sandler and a spacesuit and I thought of farts-in-space, but after seeing the trailer I am really impressed, got goosebumps all over and I am hyped for the movie. Great job.
I love how Adam Sandler occasionally takes a break from making the worst comedies you’ve ever seen to absolutely crush it as the lead actor in a serious drama movie.  Getting mad Project Hail Mary vibes with the spider alien.
When you're so lonely, you befriend the spider in your bedroom
Seems like What Dreams May Come / Eternal Sunshine in space
More frothy liberal low brow nonsense I suppose. A weak feeble man constantly apologising for being a man while being surrounded by input from strong independent female characters?  Just a guess. Stop all that space travel and pioneering nonsense and come home to be brow beaten by your wife. I mean I'm just spit balling here.
Space is fake !!!😂
Looks creative ,  looking forward to it.
adam sandler gonna solidify his career at the top
The weakness of a man's wantingness for a woman
Space nerds with arachnophobia L
Sandlers lack of accent and a space spider kinda kills it all.
Someone please kidnap Adam Sandler so he can stop making shitty netflix movies. His career ended 20 years ago.
among us
Finally a movie where sandler can actually act and isnt doing is 10th expression of a man child, that guy has so much more potentiall when the movie allows it
Love Adam!  Can't wait to see it. ❤️
I love when Adam Sandler acts in these types of the roles! His acting is so good! Can’t wait wait to see this!
I am a winner ❤
solo journey? this blooprint?
Why does it have to be a scary spider like thing.. 😢
I’m just over here waiting for Hail Mary… the book was amazing.
He looks better with a beard
Adam Sandler and Paul Dano in the same movie is something I don't know I need
Hmmmmm …. We’ll see I guess
Uncut gems was crazy already
So......spider sex ?
Dammit man I knew spiders weren't from Earth.
You had me at chernobyl and lost me at Giant Spider!
I mistook the title for Superman
I was looking forward to this trailer then I saw a talking spider and thought what a loud of horse shit no thanks.
Space Station 69
netflix : we got a spider, space, adam sandler and mental health issues. MAKE IT HAPPEN.
Man goes space. Man is sad. Man meets big spider. Man is still sad.  Not as good as Happy Gilmore.
Just look like sad depressing movie...
Adam Sandler is the goofy has been you get when you can't get anybody else to do it. Straight to Netflix. Sad.
Reminds me of Beyond The Aquila Rift, from the short movie, of Love, Death + Robots,
Sandman is Spaceman, awesome!! I hate spiders but love you Adam Sandler!!! Definitely worth a watch! 👍👍💜✌️
A bit project hailmary isn't it ?
Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds; to seek out new life and new civilizations; to boldly go where no Sandler has gone before!
This makes me excited for that Project Hail Mary movie as well because the book was great
Amazing 😍
Trailer showed too much, pass.
I love Adam Sandler but I’m not watching no damn spider ……😂🥾
Wait so this is not the trailer for Station 69??? 😂😂😂
Imagine waking up and seeing a jumping spider that big in your room.
Another steaming turd bill payer but one of the most talentless pieces of poop ever  Except uncut gems he actually had to act in that
Should have been a penguin..
The only thing that will make me watch this movie is if that spider is actually an alien and not a figment of his imagination.
Looks good guys
Reign over me is still my favorite dramatic adam sandler movie.
This should have been a woman. Im Just saying. I feel like we could deal with it better.
Rob Schneider ends up being the alien. "You can do it!"
I was thinking this was an adaptation of Project Hail Mary, never heard of Spaceman In Bohemia until looking it up now. Might read it.
*Me seeing Thumbnail:* What is it going to be Adam Sandler making a buffoon of himself in outer space or something? lol  *Me after seeing the trailer:* ...Holy shit. This was NOT the kind of Adam Sandler movie I was expecting.
I can’t wait to see this . Sandler is one of my favorites. He’s great in drama roles . Let him cook! He’s not just a comedian. ❤
Meh
You serious?  Looks like an SNL skit called Fat Astronaut
Ngl, got chills
Like that spider from Love Death + Robots. Honestly the premise is almost exactly the same, except the creature in this case reveals itself first instead of lying.
Ghey. Make more Billy Madison movies.
Is there a tiny bit of project Hail Mary here with the spider. Just asking.
Hard to believe this is the guy who wrote a goofy song about his favorite red sweatshirt on SNL over 20 years ago.
Well, guess I'm not watching this one... 👀
nobody cares but I just read the book "Hail mary" and the Alien pictured in this trailer gives a huge resemblance to the one mentioned in the book, thought it would be epic to see something like it in a show :) .
It's pronounced "spa-che-man."
Love him but this looks horrific
Yet another space movie
I read Project Hail Mary is in the works. Cant help but think this is heavily inspired by that novel, but like heavily.
Is this related to the novel Project Hail Mary?
The voice sounds like frank the rabbit from Donnie darko
Somebody read Children of Time.... Either that or they are showing us why people are really afraid of spiders.
Nicolas Cage has better indie movies. Gems was amazing, but this ...
Movie will be boring … acting will be beautiful… that’s it …
Men are going to cry at this movie. Men repress their emotions so much it's hilarious. The movie is a metaphor par excellence
aha...okay
Looks like one of those awful covid movies where they couldn't have more than two actors in a scene.
Finally, something worth watching on Netflix that’s not Woke!
Does anyone else hear Moonlight Sonata heavily sampled in the main theme?
This is the same guy who made Hubie Halloween
Wonder why he has a Czech Republic flag on his space suit.
Will Ferrell, I hope you're taking notes....
whats the name of the song
finally a space movie where humans and aliens become friends
My god, this looks great.
Adam Sandler pumping out more movies than Call of Duty and FIFA games combined.
Fricken thieves! Cowardly writers! Why did it have to be a spider! Trying to steal from project hail mary!? Hollywood is BS. Now were gonna have two spider things in space things. Not watching this...
Great to see that Adam Sandler still gets to wear baggy basketball shorts in his scifi space arthouse thriller
Can this be the same situation as the Penguin in Billy Madison?
This is an interesting concept for a movie, can’t recall another movie that focuses on the isolation mental state like this, looking forward to it
Ironically watching Happy Gilmore on repeat got me through a serious spider bite last time I was in Australia  🕷.  Not kidding 😂
Bobby Boucher graduated from UL and become a Spaceman.  Go Cougs!
This looks cool. Excited to see it!
Im surprised that there no hot “wife” but older one cuz adam is leading actor…. Thats first.
Sandler is classic
David Bowie vibes
I’m thinking this will be a movie about exploring space. At the beginning, outer space and the unknown. By the end, inner space and the places we can never actually understand.
WHY IS IT A SPIDER?!
😹😾 I hope that joker gets stuck out there 🧑🏻‍🚀
i get people have pledged allegiance to adam sandler BUT.. this looks awful.
I saw a screening of this back in 2019 at the Rosebush Institute in Poughkeepsie and it blew me away. Glad it's coming out now!
czech republic mentioned
This movie doesn’t look very funny
This rendition of Moonlight Sonata in the background was a really great touch. Made it more epic.
Who else waited for a punch line by  Adam Sandler ?
Massive Plot Hole: A Czech man missing his wife??
So has anyone else read the book "Hail Mary" by Andy Weir? A lot of what I see in this preview feels like it's taken from that story. I'm still going to watch this and I am a fan of Sandlers but damn it seems too similar.
oh great, another tax-evasion vacation movie with Adam Sandler, hope you enjoyed space rich man!
That fact that’s. spider can survive being in space that long is suchhhh bull
Seems to be a ripoff of Project Hail Mary with Adam Sandler
A giant spider????? Perhaps a little more creative on the alien front. 🤣
omg the moon shine sonata
Shelob trading Torech Ungol for a spaceship..awesome!
I think Adam does serious roles well but he just doesn't do them often enough imo.
You lost me at giant space arachnid.
you know its going to  be good when adam sandler is in it !
hanuš so he  going to be blind
I don't understand why this guy is so widely regarded as a bad actor. I found him really convincing in Click and I still consider it one of his best. Given the right writers and director he can really shine.
Might give it a watch simply for Carey Mulligan.
GOAT
As a czech its funny to hear our names,surnames 😂very excited to see this,looks great ❤
Wtf 🤨 I thought it looked good till I saw the spider.  I think Adam Sandler is a great actor but this looks crap
I don't need to watch this. I lived it. It was called the pandemic.
Looks potentially good, but I hope there’s not some dumb twist like Sandler was just hallucinating the alien the whole time.
Not even an alien would call Adam Sandler skinny.
Bruh, that must be the best Czech accent in history of cinema. Kudos to Adam!
I'm getting Project Hail Mary vibes! Similar to how I envisioned a movie version of the book...  This movie looks great though, I'll read the book before it comes out.
The premise of this gave me chills— how do I just get that song on loop too lmao I cannot wait to watch this!
Can someone please find the music from this trailer it gives me goosebumps every time I hear it
I can’t wait to watch this ❤
I love that Paul Dano is in this movie!
I have seen all the His movies But I am not watching this one due to the fact that is a spider If he switched the spider was something else okay
so it’s moon basically
What the spider? 😮
Intresting, just because of Adam Sandler i´m seeing this 100% haha
That looks AWESOME. Cinematography, the shot selection..sweeeeeet
BRO I RECOGNIZED THAT VOICE. Is that the actress from blue velvet?!?!
حلو جدا ❤❤
I don’t care how calm my spirit animals voice is, that’s still a giant spider, open the airlock!
Cool move Sandler.  Not the choice people would have expected from you.  I hope it's good!
Sure space program propaganda. The earth is flat
This looks bad to be honest, i don t see any future when it comes to movies on netflix.
This reminds me alot of that one Love Death Robots episode. Btw ČR zmíněna🫡
Reminds me of the “Love, Death, and Robots” Netflix show episode, “Beyond the Aquila Rift.” It has a somewhat similar premise with a crazy twist at the end.
Ok fine ill rewatch Billy Madison again
It's castaway in space.....
PROJECT HAIL MARY RIPOFF. Absolutely not watching this garbage.
Station 69
pretty sure i had this dream before lol I assume he talks to a red or gold nebula at some point that tells him the purpose of life and he is given the option to either become life and help spread it through the universe, or he can go back home to live his life and experience it on a level a higher entity can't. Which is wholesome
You know I love Adam Sandler but him in drama roles lately feel like an incomplete meal is the best way I can describe it. Like it’s good but it just feels like there is something missing. I think Paul Thomas Anderson suited him perfectly and without a director like that behind him his dramatic roles are just lacking, IMO.
So all of us with Arachnophobia can just go f*ck ourselves right? M'kay cool thanks Netflix 🙁👍.
yeah no
Trash boom3r😂😂😂😂
Why is this guy everywhere. Annoying little cretin.
Was excited about this before I saw a talking space spider. No, nope, no, hell no, NO.
Its looks like a good movie to sit down for and watch with a handful of popcorns
Finally Adam start shining , he's a such an underrated actor due to all of his comedies :)
Anybody else thinking what I’m thinking 🍄🕷️
Sandler doing serious roles are hit or miss. This seems like a hit. This seems like his most serious role to date.
Did he gain weight in space, asking for a friend
This movie might just help me finally get passed my intense arachnophobia.
Looks dumb
So Netflix ripped off Scavengers Reign...  a spaceman who is introduced to a telepathic alien who feeds him images of his wife while feeding on his essence. I love Adam Sandler and maybe he doesn't know he's ripping off scavengers reign but he is...  Netflix clearly can't do original content ay 😢
This looks great!
Why did it have to be a spider damnit
Read Project Hail Mary. Much better than this.
When I first saw the spider come out, I was hoping this was going to be an adaptation of the Hail Mary book, but excited to see how this will be nonetheless
What a proud moment to be a Czech guy
Directed by Johan Renck. Search for Stakka Bo and Mute. Same person.
Movie looks kinda weird lol
Looks good !!
I noticed a lot of comedians get more dramatic with age and have a better ability to play in dramas or more serious roles later in life.  Jim Carry started doing serious roles and now Adam Sandler. I guess in a way it makes movies a bit more fun.
Was NOT expecting an empathetic spider let alone a spider at all.  Should be dope.
ripped off a lot from Hail Mary
Plot twist he's navigating Kevin's James gravitational pull to get him a script to grown ups 3
Show this to Kevin Hart
Firmament
So basically anyone with a fear of spiders won't be watching this.
Wilson!
Calli is going to watch this one.
This looks suspiciously similar to project Hail Mary
8 crazy nights in space!!!
1:32 I don’t know, kind of adorable lol
Spider "Im here to help you" pulls out Fleshlight...The End.
anybody else think this is like a weird twisted version of project hail Mary?
I don't get why people are surprised by Adam Sandler? He does a drama every few years and always kills it. Punch- drunk love, Hustle, Uncut Gems, Reign Over Me, The Meyerowitz Stories, etc. The guys amazing. Also, Johan Renck!? Sign me the hell up.
I will definitely watch this. Never would have thought of Sandler heading to space in a more serious role. There are too many serious actors trying to be funny than comedians trying to be serious in Hollywood in my opinion or at least in the movies I've watched so I'm excited for this.
tak to ti jebe
I'm getting "Click" Vibes from this. I can't wait
Hahahaha, spaceman.
He’s talking to a spider, how stupid.
If you are hungry, go to McDonald's and buy a cheeseburger 🍔 and eat it. After that you won't be hungry anymore.
IT'S A GOOD THING SNL FIRED HIM LOL
“ Adam Sandler, Carey Mulligan… Giant Space Spider from Webulon 9””   …. SPACEMAN
what? Adam Sandler in a dramatic movie?! :O im so proud of him <3
Now that's what I call high quality arachnophobia!
Looks like another poc…
Adam in space, the first and going to be good
This a harry potter prequel when meet the traveler
Ummmm is that a huge spider?! Houston we may have a problem!!
They better have a good explanation of why it's a god damn spider. A space spider? That's an Earthly animal.. Unless he takes that form for some reason...or he ends up being a figment of his imagination when it's all said and done
If this intrigues you, check out Moon from 2009. It has Sam Rockwell on a 3 year stint on the moon by himself. Movie is sick.
I haven't read Spaceman from Bohemia, the book this is taken from but it feels a little like Project Hail Mary.
This is a very interesting concept for Sandler. This movie looks good. I’ll def watch it
Eh...just looks like loads of hallucinations to me.
Another dumb movie
Whats up with the font???
Where’s the fart jokes and rob Schneider or Kevin James being fat jokes his best movies are the fun ones
No no no. Happy Gilmore 2 please. I don’t care if he can act. Want. Dumb. And. Funny.
I’ve seen better movie trailers
Wow i did not clock that the creature is voiced by Paul Dano! This looks so unusual but intriguing. The trailer gives away just enough, can't wait for this!
Did it have to be a spider…..
Such an underrated actor.
Okay, this looks interesting.
Another scaremongering and propaganda film to make stupid money
0:06 189 days 1+8+9 = 18 = 6+6+6 0:35 All seeing eye
Watched this to have a laugh but now I actually want to watch it
Anyone else catch the Czech flag? Anyone this might be pretty great but it might also just be good.
Rated R? Oh god he’s penned by the spider alien isn’t he
1:00 - OH HELLL NO.
Yay non superhero film
Kind of has "Project Hail Mary" vibes  if anyone read that book.
More crap pushed by Netflix who wants to watch this shit ?
wow looks good!
Is that a spider from mars!
They keep making this movie
Sadler is excellent
Queen Ghoma , from ocarina of Time
The oinly problem is that my mind would be all the time waiting and looking for a Rob Scheinder cameo to show up
Finally A Serious Role For Adam.....Im Actually Excited To Be Honest.....Cos I Believe ""Click"" Was His Most Serious Movie Role...n His Best By Far.....This Is Gonna Be On A Whole Different Level....n I Cant Wait ....
Adam Sandler be like I'm getting that Oscar if it's the last thing I do! More power to you Sandman. You deserve an Academy Award! ❤
Adam looks so old!
i really like the premise but why does it have to be a spider. This is going to be a creepy movie for me.
This looks incredible
Reminds me of that Love Death & Robots episode
I'm a Spaceman Got a rocket on my back Spaceman Oh, I'm raving like a maniac Spaceman Got a rocket on my back The universe is down For my rave attack
tbh i only clicked on this cause i seen adams face lol
Comic actors act the best sad roles.
Dude is a good actor, but who wouldn’t make shitty comedies with their friends for boat loads of cash.
Another Netflix Adam Sandler movie where he dies at the end
I love the music
WHAT SAY YOU!?
Whoever did that spiders voice sound like an idiot and a bad actor.
Stupid
This is what happens when you write a screenplay in just 72 hours whilst on a mind blowing hallucinogenic journey. This screen magic was made with the aid of a steady diet of psychoactive substances and red bulls, whilst you’re having an interactive conversation with a gigantic benevolent spider that is perched on your windowsill.
This looks incredible .
I would have loved to have watched this, it's a shame I'm arachnophobic.
Finally taking a serious role, let’s do it.
O snap a space spidur....
Rob Schneider is… a spider!  …but yeah if this turns out to be as good as it looks I’ll be left with more questions than answers 😅
For some reason, I was expecting it to be a comedy... this is way better.
hes serious movie, proud of him
Oh shit, not Sandler again...could he please just stop it... I was a huge fan back then when he did movies like Little Nicky, Happy Gilmore, Anger Management. But the past decades were just....disturbing
at space, in space, or on space ?
No! Adam Sandler no ! noooooooo!!!!!!!
He's come along way Mr sandler
Well there is one movie i wont see because of big hairy you know what. ugh
I clicked because of Adam
shows how talented an actor Sandler could be. This looks a pretty interesting flick.
WTF?
Anybody know what the song is?
How do I get rid of arachnophobia 😭😭😭
I thought it was the Philippine flag i saw on his left shoulders, it is similar but the colors are in wrong places.
Project Hail Mary has changed since I read it
Gonna be a banger! Much awaited. 👊 19 Jan 2024
cute lil spider lol
So, she's dead, right?
I’m curious if this has anything to do or is inspired by Adrian Tchaikovsky’s “Children of Time” book series?😮
Looks like a good movie and was very intrigued but too bad I can never watch it with a giant spider. Thanks, Adam and Netflix. Couldn't have made it a different alien or creature?
Why did it have to be a freaking spider?!
Chernobyl was incredible im excited to see more from the director.
Wtf dude hahahahahahahahaha
Adam Sandler doing another serious movie? Aww hell yeah.
Is this based off of the book Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir?
Anyone’s 15 pro max overheating
The book this is based on is really good. Very thought provoking and worth the read.
This is little Nicky prt 2😮😊
what’s the name of the so g
Wow... Speechless.
Castaway the space edition
Wow
I've been desperately waiting for another Adam Sandler drama since Uncut Gems, but knowing this is from the director of Chernobyl, makes this even more exciting.
YabaDOO
Jesus arachnophobia… might be more of a horror for some people  lol
Looks interesting!
So let me guess...on this moon he found these magical mushies....and this is his near-death experience...? 🤣 Hope they've done the spider creature as well as Tchaikovsky in Children of Ruin, eh.
This looks like a A24 movie.
Am I the first one to think of that one song he did with Rob Schneider called Space station 69?? I first thought OMG they'll make a movie about anything nowadays
Coming soon Jesus Christ, be ready. The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life throught Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 6:23 You and I broke the law and Jesus paid the fine. God demonstrates his own love for us in this, while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Romans 5:8 Believe and repent today! The consequences are eternal.
looks bad
This looks dope
Why is there only one person on that spaceship? Doesn’t seem like a good plan from the space agency to have a crew of one. Especially one that had a pregnant wife back home. So when screening an astronaut candidate for this particular mission, they don’t take the emotional and psychological effects in the play of a mission with a long duration? Also, how long is the mission? The trailer mentions six months. Is it six months into a longer mission? Don’t know! 🤷🏻‍♂️ Whatever. A trailer that is purposefully cut to be dramatic, and people will just eat it up. Honestly, a trailer like this needs more of a quick context into the astronauts background before it dives into the psychic cosmic realm. Crafted from the minds in Hollyweird. Meh to this film so far. 👎🏼
Adam $&%^^# Sandler. The comic goof. WTF.
how tf is this dude STILL wearing basketball shorts in space 🤣🤣🤣
it'ss always stupid to send someone alone. 1st mistake.
I really like this Director but the fact it's Netflix and Adam Sandler really makes me not have any hopes for this at all. Could be wrong though. Edit: Channing Tatum being a producer also doesn't help at all.
I'm genuinely excited for this. Adam sandler is a good comedian, but I truly believe he's an even better drama actor.
Wow, an Adam Sandler movie I might actually like. Looks incredible.
💩💩
space is fake and gay
Netflix get off Adam’s sandlers wenis he had 8 crazy nights and 50 first dates, either make a movie with a number in it or forget it
wtf is this
Reminds me of love death& robots episode where they realise they've been under a false reality by an intelligent space arachnid just trying to keep their mind at ease whilst their physical reality decays.
Oh cool a drama with Adam Sandler? I bet he'll do really ---- SPIDER! GET IT OFF MY SCREEN! GET IT OFF! CLOSE IT CLOSE IT CLOSE AHHHH
Alright a stopped the trailer at 1:35 because I don't want a pinch more of this spoiled. Looks super interesting. Excited to watch it with no other bits revealed.
If only Adam Sandler could act, then this movie might of had a chance. Wasn't he on pedo Island as well with all of his movie buddies?
I'm just commenting because I need 25 more subs to go live. 🤷‍♂
Meh
cue Hardwell - Spaceman
I’m always down for a serious Adam Sandler role! Can’t wait to watch this. 👏🏻
Adam Sandler is a PHENOMENAL actor. He just likes making goofymovies and people underestimate him for that.
Its all in his head.
Hell to the no i don’t like spiders
This looks hilarious. Can’t wait
song at the beginning anyone??
Still not resubscribing you fucks
Adam Sandler is the greatest actor of all time.
looks boooooring
Event Horizon Prequal?
Adam Sandler befriends an alien spider? Now I gotta watch this 😂
I'm arachnophobic and won't be seeing this because a spider that size in such a close proximity makes this an horror movie for me
Am I the only one that was laughing during the whole trailer?
Give me.  Give me. Give me.
Does anyone else get Black Mirror vibes? Like the episode with the space spider that showed a guy a false reality because he was dying and surrounded by his dead crew?… Still looking forward to seeing this but I can’t NOT think of that episode after seeing this.
Another serious role with Sandler, I'm keen
Man
Oooooooook. Sooooo that's not what I was expecting. Sandler possibly in another amazing film
Feels like Hollywood is looking into old Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits for ideas.
This man is unstoppable. Can't wait to see this.
Makes me sad to know some people aren't going to give this a chance purely based on the giant space spider 😂
Once I saw the giant spider I said… “I’m out.”
Mom sent me this saying there was a Project Hail Mary movie 😂😂
Do you think he...ya know...with the spider...he been alone a very long time...a man has needs...
This was written by ai
what trash
Like Adam Sandler batter when he was fighting Bob barker
This looks really good. Love when the sandman does serious roles.
So did Andy Weir get any consideration from the book he wrote called “Project Hail Mary?” Which yes I read it, looks exactly like this. Like him being alone in deep space, to a spider like alien who communicates telepathically, and small bright organisms floating in space. Like yes there is a lot of differences I’m sure, but copy and paste much? Grant it I have not seen the film, so maybe there will be a “based on the novel by Andy Weir” but I have a strange feeling if Netflix and Adam Sandler are involved that it wouldn’t surprise if it’s another idea stolen. But already I’m gonna be a cliche and say the book is better than the movie, to which usually I give both equal footing most times. Netflix has a reputation of taking a book concept and just throwing it out the window. It’s a little ridiculous to change the name, most of the story, and have Adam Sandler in a serious role. There are a massive amount of better actors out there. He cannot do serious well. Normally I am not a person to comment on things in a negative way, due to it being toxic or rude. However, when a well written story gets ripped off or just plain changed, it becomes rather upsetting for me. Though I will still watch the movie, mostly because I enjoy space/science fiction related things, but I’m sure I will be grossly disappointed. Sorry if you like Adam Sandler, he just is not a person I would ever consider for something like this.
I am very curious to see how this movie is on the visual aspect. Adam Sandler has already proven himself to be a great dramatic actor but with doing a sci-fi movie at this caliber I am excited to see how crazy they get with the colors, framing, designs, etc.
I want to watch the movie but i probably won't because of the spider
I almost dropped my phone when I saw the spider 😂😂
The Frick?????????????????
Not Too Shabby
carey mulligan...this seems similar to her character in Drive. And sandler can be great when he isn't doing a ridiculous voice and character
What the?? Did I miss the funny parts cuz all I seen is Adam Sandler as an astronaut talking to a spider?? Make it make sense🤷‍♂😂
A talking spider that’s interesting
Hope there’s tons of nudity!
Looks to me like someone in Hollywood has read "Children of Time" and "Children of Ruin"
This looks good.
Spider-Man: Farther from Home
I wanna watch this but man I hate spiders.
Well…. If homeboy wasn’t a freakin spider I might watch… but idk if I can’t get past it haha
After that "dont be afraid" line it made me realize that maybe biblically accurate angels are spiders, with their many eyes.
Reminds me of Ad Astra with Brad Pitt but with spiders.
I need this to be good. I really need this to be good. Also, when a movie is rated R just for language, I feel its a good sign that there will be some well written dialogue. There has to be is there's no violence or sex to draw attention.
He is a fantastic actor. I loved his comedies, even the silly w/e ones, but his serious roles show how he really gives it his all.
Watch he gets nominated for this.
So is this the unofficial sequel to Eight Legged Freaks…
No nudie magazine day in space
Every space movie protagonist after impregnating his wife: Well time to go to space forever 😊🎉
That looks interesting.
I love Adam sandler
Very heavy MOON vibes. But im very intrigued.
I can't believe I'm thinking this...........Spaceman seems like it may be really good.
look like sleep moive
This just feels like a feature length version of the Love Death & Robots episode "Beyond the Aquila Rift". Still looks good but in no way original.
Children of time vibes
This looks damn intriguing. I love seeing actors outside their normal roles. This looks special. Excited to see it.
This feels like a movie about the effects of long term isolation. That spider and those other "otherworldly" scenes probably are just his hallucinations.
Ive said this for a long time, but Adam Sandler is one of the best dramatic actors out there. Even in his comedies he’s just naturally a good actor.
Beyond the Aquila Rift?
"Its nice to finally see Adam sandler take on a more serious dramatic role"...  Literally 0:04 seconds in...
🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿 díky Jaroslave, je hezký vidět něco českého na Netflixu
Paul Dano is the sexiest spider ever
Did you not see the Life movie?! that thing can't go back to Earth
6 months of isolation, that's it? I do that twice a year.
This feels vaguely reminiscent of a scifi novel I read last year (don't recall the name, sorry) about a guy on a mission who becomes stranded somehow and meets an alien in another ship who looks like a spider (that's where I'm going with this!) and they start working together to science their way out of a mutual predicament. It was really good and this reminds me of it. THIS is "can't wait" movie for me!
Good to see everyone including the man himself acknowledge that he is not a comedian
I hope the Spider doesn’t betray him 🥺
No more movies about imiganations already
He will find Station 69
I really wanted to watch this, but my arachnophobia won't let me. Why did it have to be a spider
Emotional Support Spider. Gotta say, that is new.
Really intrigued by this. Nice to see Adam Sandler tackle more serious work.
I wonder what the song is in the beginning of the trailer
Spoiler Alert: We can't leave this atmosphere.
Adam sandler with a space octopus im in :D
That's why i don't pay for Netflix, looks so shitty...
Welp I guess this isn't the riff on Station 69 I thought it was gunna be...
A better title? A better script? More original shots? Needs more but might be worth checking out
Lol
Calling it now it’s an angel
Spoiler alert: the spider eats him in the end. *shrugs*
This seems like is going to have a bad ending
Funniest movie he's done
Don't tell they actually made a separate trailer for each country. And that is why I see a Czech flag on his space costume! If they really did this, it is ducking awesome!
Netflix should purchase Magazine Dreams
I’m going to guess that he just lost it and created this alien for companionship.
This could've been a perfect science fiction horror movie!!!
Something original finally
YOU CAN DO EEEET, but not do ET
Harry Potter: Aragog's Journey - Follow the events before Aragog met Hagrid. Staring Adam Sandler as the Traveling Spaceman in his spaceship named Pocket.
Okay then.
Oh great. This will be a hit with the ladies. A giant, creepy, hairy spider in a confined space, IN SPACE. I FREAKIN' LOVE IT!!!!
Ground control to major Tom?
Can we please see something with a *happy* astronaut? Frickin' hollywood thinks all astros are miserable!
I like this movie.
ET pt. 2 finna be epic
Did someone just rip off Hail Mary?
imagine Adam Sandler's boring face and lousy acting, and take it into deep space. wow, promising!
Looks excellent!
Wow all these space movies about extra terrestrials and inter dimensional beings coming out at this time..
he def ded and hallucinating
Ground control to major Tom...
So space is created in a Hollywood Basement? Js 🤷🏽‍♂️
Adam Sandler is an astronaut, now? What is next?
Jacob! What are you doing in this trailer? We were supposed to go for icecream in 30 minutes?
why is he from Czechia? They don't even have a space program. It doesn't make any sense. :D
Eh not sure if its for me but ill watch anything with the sandman in it. Im hoping for some more comedies from him in the future.
Fist my bump.
They missed the chance of adding theam song of - Space Oddity 😱
It's been a while since I see Adam in a movie. Looking forward to this!
Is this Project Hail Mary?
Adam Sandler really going full on with Netflix ..
I don’t like scary creatures 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Project hail mary??? looks like a knock off, but i do love me some adam sandler
Adam Sandler yeahbhh
Why are aliens always naked when they contact us
Chris Parnell IS SPACEMAN
Damn, that actually looks really good
Another Adam Sandler banger on the way
Seeing the Czech flag on Adam Sendler's shoulder is wonderful. ❤
The fact people still have netflix blows my mind. This looks so stupid.
Sort of like one of Robin WIlliams serious films "What Dreams May come". I hope that Adam Sandler can show everyone that he really can do serious roles and that Uncut Gems wasn't just a one off.
WHY A SPIDEEER??????
so I bet the spider want to help him come back home so he can tag along and eat us all on earth
Bro this looks so good! Can’t wait
Is that the Movie about the Andy Weir book Projekt Hail Mary???
This looks so goddamn fantastic, slightly reminiscent of the 2009 movie Moon, which is my favorite movie so I'm super excited for this release. Adam Sandler being serious is a wonder to behold.
Oh no, my arachnophobia. 😅😂
I loved this movie when it was called MOON with Sam Rockwell.
Awesome
So, Interstellar with a fat astronaut?
Sandler can pull off the serious roles for sure and giant talking spider! I'm in!
I can see Kevin James playing the spider, but where is Salma Hayek?
Soooo.. its like the movie solaris?
As a Czech, I truly appreciate them NOT trying to give the characters Czech accents. It's really hard for foreigners to do and always just comes out sounding inexplicably russian, so I'm glad they didn't.
He got stuck in a Spiderweb in space didn’t he. The spider is showing him memories as he is slowly dying in real time.
What a bunch of propoganda crap to make the sheep believe nonsense. People are so stupid that they will eat it up. Just like they did the moon landing film. Some people are just incapable of distinguishing things shown on a screen from reality.
Give @flooko the credit he deserves!
omg something creative ...beyond alien mars fkkkin drama
Adam not playing games
That looks really interesting. He's really never made a movie I didn't like. I realize that may not be a popular opinion but it's still true.
Aragog!
Adam Sandlers’ own version of Cast Away
Giant Spider ?!? Oh heck no!
why does he sounds like an American 😅
netflix execs must be high AF the day they gave this the green light. what the actual F.
A spider squid in space talking to Adam Sandler? Jesus Christ
Really cool to see Adam Sandler playing a serious role like this. This looks interesting. "I don't need your help"  ... "But you do"  spooky 👀
Gave me goosebumps
I hate spiders in real life and i now hate space arachnids even more after the show live death and robots and now this
Why did it had to be a damn spider
wake up to a giant spider?  burn it...
This looks like a cheap copy of Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir
Beyond the Aquila Rift
I love Adam but not my kind of movie
Don't tell me this is another Moon remake!
Gonna watch it for Adam
My speculation/hypothesis:  1.  His isolation triggers hallucinations.  Example the spider. 2.  He dies at the end. 3.  The whole thing was in his head and he's on Earth the whole time.
they could stay with a space, sandler and spider but they had to put there a stupid woman deperession thoughts, and ruin it
Sandler is just one of the good guys a good human through and through.
Netflix you get an Oscar for best trailer.
The HOLY BIBLE is the Word of God through his Son Our Lord Jesus Christ.  Genesis 1-3 New International Version  The Beginning 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.  It is very clear that human can only live on earth.  A lot of strong evidence that the Bible is true. If man lives outside the earth will only die!
For those who don't know, the movie is based on the book "Spaceman of Bohemia"
I was thinking earlier today that if humans had never met a spider there is no way we could imagine such an animal.  Them choosing a spider as the alien gave me goose bumps.
I like it how they just don't say he meets an alien, but "is he imagining this out of loneliness?"
Netflix film also has Adam Sandler you knows its gonna be a trash film
Adams movies were far better in the 90's early 2000's
I love how broken Adam Sandler looks, almost makes you feel for him
I also need space spider therapy
So basically he's copying the movie 'Moon' (Minus the clones) and throwing in "the eater of worlds" aka Pennywise in his creepy spider form.  PASS
After sandler exposed his racism towards Arabs/Palestinians, Muslims and Christians as well as Native Americans, thankfully a lot of us B0YC0TT him, starbucks, mcdonalds, coke, zara, hp...The only reason I watch Netflix is because of Dave Chappelle, a true comedian, something sandler knows nothing about.
interesting to see him in a serious role, i only saw comedys
Always enjoyed Adam as an actor and his movies. Very much looking forward to this.
i wonder when did Hollywood decide that Carrey Mulligan was going to be typecast as "wife of astronaut"
I searched around the universe, been to some black holes But I'm up in space, man And I wanna go home
"Do not be afraid"....i don't have arachnophobia but i gave the craziest scream of my life when saw that spider.
Looks ok BUT he will be in one room all the movie like ALL nextflix films based in one location with dragged out scenes.. But you only just noticed right, 🤣
Americans! You just can't be bothered to pronounce anyone's name properly, can you! It's disgusting that they made this film about a Czech man, yet couldn't be bothered to say his surname name correctly. His first name isn't mentioned in this clip, but I bet it's pronounced incorrectly. Won't be watching this, it's cringeworthy when Americans continuously butcher foreign names.
As much as I like his movies I am gonna pass on this one after reading more about the story and book it is based off.............
Spasandler?
It's trailer for "Project Hail Mary" movie. That what I thought in the beginning.
I was so confused to see the Czech flag and names. Turns out it's based on a novel written by a Czech American writer. By his own words: Originally, the main character was an American, with all the stereotypical attributes. Once he applied a different nationality, closer to his own heart, it added "depth" to the story, as the astronaut had "real issues." Once this change was made, the story lengthened; "It was because I changed him to something that was close to me and that I really wanted to write about a lot"
Sandler one of my favourite artist not only actor ❤from India
Is this Hail Mary without science 😅
was wonderin where he was . oh i get it hes gone to space
why does it have to be a giant spider though 😖
This does NOT look like a movie starring Adam Sandler...! O.O
Where could i find this rendition of the song "Moonlight Sonata"?
......... Well THAT'S different!
Movie idea number two thousand three hundred and five: Adam Sandler is trapped in space with a giant spider and misses his wife.
The only reason this movie is set in space, is because Adam Sandler wanted to vacation there.
Why the Philippines flag?
Another 2 cast movie from netflix 🎉🎉🎉movie industry is dying 😂😂😂
This is 100% the ep from love death and robots
Netflix has jumped the shark. Yikes.
Is all we get just a little shoulder flag? 🇨🇿
I hope he randomly walks around screaming for Conan O'Brien, like he does in real life.
My favorite comedy actor adam syndler ❤❤❤❤❤❤ I m fan
Would have made a lot more sense if they hadn't made him Russian with an American accent
Everyone is so use to him in comedy they could take have  thought he could be serious.
My first thought was its a comedy movie when I saw Adam Sandler in the thumbnail.
Moonlight Sonata,,,, the perfect trailer music for a space themed movie
Just what I like.
I thought this was going to be a bad space comedy like Pluto Nash or something. Glad it looks to be a more serious movie with interesting ideas.
I hope they squeeze in Station 69 in the movie.....somehow!
i am all in this gonna be a good movie.Finally netflix work on something good.  After endless movies of generic plot
It's pronounced "Spa-chem-in"
Most sci-fi thing about this is that Czech space program :D :P
Wow, this looks cool.
This reminds me of "love death and robots: beyond the Aquila rift".  Crazy short story that is so similar to this.
At first, I thought it was a Philippine flag..
Yeah if he made a switch to drama roles permanently I'd be cool with it. I love Adam Sandler. Reminds me of my dad, same shaped head and all. I do wish he made a little Nicky continuation 😆 get in the flask!
It's a fkin spider!!!!.... why does it have to be a spider!!!!
Finally something that doesn't look like woke garbage.
I dont usually like Adam Sandler movies but this looks interesting. I'm betting the spider is real but its just a normal spider up in a corner of rhe ship. His growing insanity makes it larger than it is.
Whats czech about the main lead? Will he discuss Zeman and Babiš? Will he miss svíčková and plzeň? Will he drop some KURVA DOPÍČI? A ř? I mean... this guy experiences 200 days of solitude, surely he will miss more than his wife, no?
Another space related masterpiece 😀❤❤
A lot of talent contributing to this one. Wish Netflix would do wider theater distribution of their more cinematic works. I for one would be happy to pay "twice" to see a good movie, or even a halfway decent one. So tired of watching movies at home.
WILSON !
So, no Steve Buscemi in this one?
Always hyped when Paul Dano voices over trailers. Best part of The Batman trailer honestly.
A whole lotta folks making some pretty weighty thinks about the meaning of this film from just a trailer...
If it's Sandler I'm already sold.
*takes the form of a giant space spider*  I did not wish to frighten you,
SHHAABBDOOOOOO!!!
I love reign over me
I love actors at this stage in their career where don't have to make a name for themselves and get into serious roles
Search for Stakka Bo - Soft Room, Great Blondino, Here we go, Killer, Mute, Love of a woman. And yes, that is the director of tthis movie. Kinda incredible, but cool.
Wow, no David Bowie space references?
Finally, a serious and non comedic Adam Sandler movie
is it just me or anybody else are waiting for him to drop some comedic punchline at the end of the trailer 😂😂😂
The spaceman cant imagine that he is rejected by so many of you. How could you do this. Dont you want to know what is out there. Dont you see what is happening around you? I dont get it. Maybe I am not the spaceman. But I do say. You can be very sure that if you ignore me. You cant say I told you. I am not putting the blame on you. I give you one hint. If you want to find me. Follow the numbers. Start to look at the runtime of anything that is recorded. Good luck. See you soon.
Did spiders produce this movie so people will stop fearing them?
Sandler always kills it in a more dramatic role. This looks pretty good. Can't wait to give it a watch.
Looks terrible
This looks like 2001 A Space Odyssey but still original enough to not be labelled a copycat
Beyond the Aquila Rift anyone?
This looks fuckin sweet
Its the Spiderman symbiote
nope.
Glad to see the Sandman getting out there more. He's always been an underrated actor, partly because of the movies he chose to do at the beginning of his career, but it's great that others are taking notice of what a phenomenal actor he is
Where is Wilber? 😂
I love how Adam Sandler, after years of making low brow comedies to set him and his friends for life, started to show others his actual acting skill
netflix pelase invest in many more talented underated actors out there..
If an Alien arrived on the planet and said he would destroy the earth unless he can eat one Celebrity, I'm heading straight to Adam Sandler's house with a net.
fools still think "space" is real...
Yall jits should watch RocketMan its hella funny
Sandler went to Tisch for drama he just also happened to have had a knack for making people laugh. This looks like it could be really good.
Nobody ever talks about Reign on Me. It's one of Adam's best dramatic turns, and it's easily top five in my Adam Sandler collection.  He's fantastic in dramas.
Y'all, watching this trailer for the first time high is a ROLLERCOASTER.
Looks like one of Hagrids spiders made it as a space counselor.
Welcome To Outer Space
From the directors of "IT"!
Whoa! Someone stole one of the sentient spiders from Adrian Tchaikovsky's outstanding novel "Children of Time," and inserted it into Adam Sandler's spacecraft!
ADAM SANDLER? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE??? I waiting for them to play Gangnam style..
Always enjoy an Adam Sandler movie, even the stinkers like Little Nickey.
This will either suck or be masterpiece there is no in between with Netflix, spiders or Adam Sandler
Love when he plays a serious character role. Shows his range and you don’t need to be funny all the time.
Looks like Adam Sandler found Aragog 🕷️
"EVERY" ACTOR HAS THEIR BREAK I GUESS.. NAPOLEAN SUCKED
If it got fangs, I ain't trusting it!
Sandler just made this movie so he and all of his friends could vacation in space. Rob Schneider is probably the bug suit. 🤣🤣🤣
Cool another stupid ass Adam Sandler movie no one needed or wanted I hope that they make more of those please don't
This looks awful.
I hope this is turns out to be a good movie, I'm always looking forward to see Adam Sandler getting cast against type in a non comedy role. Adding Carey Mulligan in the mix as part of the cast increases my interest
Call it sky fall
Very curious combination of elements here, it'll either be amazing or really bad, but Chernobyl was an awesome series so I think we're in good hands
Nope…
This looks more like a secret comedy masked as a drama film, because this looks and sounds like a meme 😂
This looks very promising. The fact it's attached to Netflix has me worried since they have so many disappointing movies.
But why 2.5 M views 🧐
Moon meets Donnie Darko Meets The Fountain
This looks like a real boring movie. Wont be seeing it.
Adam Sandler needs to go away, already.  The hack needs to disappear.
It reminds me a LOT of Project Hail Mary...
Punch Drunk Love is one of my fave movies of all time. Uncut Gems is a fantastic movie too. All great directors and an awesome actor. Def stoked for this one
Is the movie just a bad joke?
Click in Space 😂
space water boy?
It's so rare to watch Adam's more serious movie like this
No sound
Im very intrigued by this been digging these recent films of his man. Also my arachnophobia is triggered lololol im sorry but I'll pay for a therapist and tell ppl life doesn't exist in space lolol
🔥
Reminds me of the book Project Hail Mary…
Hope this will be something!!
Spawn charicter
This feels like Solaris mixed with Bridge to Terabithia
an alien spider?
Instead of a spider they should have made it the penguin he's always chasing on billy madison.  Glad he's making another movie. Adam Sandler is the man
Interesting
I've been waiting years for a 30 Rock spin off.
An alien shrink.  Sure Ok.
So it's a horror?
He is back hell yaaaaa!
Could it be?  An actual show where I want to watch Adam Sandler?
Has "Project Hail Mary" vibes.....especially the alien.
I love it when he takes on a serious role. I wish he would have done more of them. He's actually a pretty good actor. The appreciation for his ability to portray serious roles is evident, and there's a desire for more such performances. Recognizing his talent as an actor adds an extra layer of admiration for his versatility and skill in bringing different characters to life."
Plot twist. The Space Spider is sucking him dry while he is hallucinating into death. "Everything that begins must End". That Spider is the start of a graceful ending.
Looks good. Seems like a mixture of Interstellar and The Fountain
dat is a big f*ing spider
why would they send a fat guy into outerspace ?
I’m glad they gave the alien the appearance of a jumping spider—as far as aliens go, that’s not a very common trope!  Looks like good “finding your inner compass” Solyaris stuff
Finally something that isn’t re-made, or rebooted! Looking forward to this
I'm always down for Adam Sandler not being type casted into a goofy guy
Isn’t bro supposed to have an Eastern European accent?
Only clicked because of Adam. He’s going to do really good in his role.
I have been a ride or die Adam Sandler fan from the very beginning, so being able to follow his arc from goofball to serious dramatic actor has been a pretty awesome journey.
It’s weird how Adam Sandler is a much better dramatic actor than a comedic one nowadays
Netflix presents: the spider therapist
I dont like that they make the alien a spider. Not a fan of spiders.
Watch Adam Sandler in:  'Reign Over Me'  It's by far his best film he ever acted in. Sheer brilliant acting and very sad.
Still waiting on the Click 2 when Adam Sandler uses the Universal Remote to travel through his past movies and characters ! Make it happen please ! 🙂
Adam Sandler´s acting skills are like a fine wine. They grow better with time.....
RIP Arachnophobes
A talking spider
If he has a mental breakdown scene where he yell "Shhyaaaddaapp!!!" It's over
Netflix has been knocking out some bangers recently.
100 bones says the telepathic spider is ticking him into showing it the location of earth for a new food supply.
So excited to see this!!!!
The Space Sandman
Forgot to send Matt Damon and potatoes.
Boykott zionist actors and movies
Giant Space spider?  Nope!
This reminds of my this music video: Lights - Drive My Soul [Official Music Video]
The spider is sucking is brain juice
The spider did it for me 👍
hope this is good, nice to see sandler branching more into dramatic roles. uncut gems was great. hopefully he can keep it up
This looks depressing af
Wow I really hope this is a serious role for Adam Sandler
Station 69?
They have hit the bottom of the barrel
This looks awful. Stick to goofy comedies, Adam.
So the jellyfish UAP is real?
Sandman at it again. Gonna be golden.
I’m getting real Project Hail Mary vibes from this. Anyone else read that book?
Can anyone explain everything that happens within the trailer? Thanks!
Sandler and the Space-Spider
I saw a fat dude floating in space and got excited cuz I thought it was the trailer to Tom and Bert's soon to be movie, "Fat Astronauts".... im sry Adam lol trailer looks great tho!
so, when you see him in the space suit walking in the river.. the spider is already inside his suit. that is the ending scene. but thats just a guess lol
Adam wants his Oscar
Adam Sandler is on his side quests 💯
This reminds me a lot of Project Hail Mary
Giant alien spider helps astronaut with his marriage problems is at the very least an original idea.
This looks genuinely amazing, showed this to my girlfriend and she’s just as hype as I am for this movie, can’t wait!
I might be down for a trip.😊
Sorry but Adam Sandler as an overweight astronaut....can't take it seriously
Big ass space spider. Eff every single bit of that crap.
Why did it have to be spiders  Why couldn't it be follow the butterflies
Wow this looks bad
Honestly, I get so hyped whenever Adam Sandler takes on a serious role💯💯💯 Uncut Gems was brilliant.
TRAILER MUSIC PLEASE!!!
Wooow finally we didn’t see the entire cast of Grown ups
My arachnophobia ass ain't no way I'm watching this movie
i literally can't watch. Big spider alert
Man, he's so good. I REALLY wish this was a Theatrical release. It looks great visually.
is this like Castaway, but in space? 😂
is this... comedy? 💀
Reminds me of the Love, Death and Robots episode "Beyond the Aquila Rift"
AS will still win an Oscar. Quote me on that
Im still waiting for Rob Schneider to say "You can do it!"
ok I gotta see this
but why does it have to be a giant spider?!?!?!
The creature design is so boring, it's just a giant spider
A Netflix original movie has become a meme for a reason...
lmao wait am I in a fever dream this feels like a huge april fools joke
Why?
Chehoslovakian astronaut ?
Everything about this looks amazing. Except the giant spider. Gonna be a hard pass for me because that is terrifying lol
Oooh, spooky spider.
This is fuckin art. Genuinely shocked how good and sad this trailer is
Netflix movie, so i guess it is about the first man that give birth in space..  lol I think i can do without it. 🙂
Give us a new movie which is spiritual successor of 2001 a space odyssey
That's the fattest astronaut I've ever seen
❤❤❤
Plot: Spaceman Cheats on his wife with an alien spider in space
Adam Sandler sux
Gives me interstellar vibes
Why did it have to be an effn spider?!😔 I love space movies, but have Aracniphobia. RiP my emotions 😓
Why choose a spider? It’s freaking scary choose a floating light
I have no idea how Adam Sandler has the time to make so many movies lol he has a big deal with Netflix just feels like he comes out with 2-3 a year. Good for him!
Everything that begins must end...
even if it's in space, the smell of shit reaches here
Should have named in Station 69
6 billion dollars in box office revenue and all with the same haircut! Lol. Way to go Adam. 😮😅
The Zohan!
After seeing uncut Gems , this dude is a serious actor and one of my favorite movies.... from what i used to view him as that same voice comedy acting he stepped it up
Yeah !!!!!
Was able to Watch this in its Entirety about 1yr and a half ago. Cant wait to see a Finished Version.
I love Sandler but this movie looks painful
Deep Soundtrack. I like it!
Ive been in isolation for three years. This is light work
Oh man this reminds of that Love.Death.Robots episode with the space captain hallucinating reality but its really like a big ass spider alien yo WTF i hate spiders fam
Why in tf does his russian wife have an english accent
I thought this was a comedy
no thanks space spider.
It looks confusing
Reminds me of Project Hail Mary!
3 days after this Dune comes out
Solaris (1972)? Is that you?
this looks like garbage
Great, now 'Emotional Support Tarantulas' are a thing.
why a spider? 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 this will be the hardest movie to watch for me
It seems like the space program, like the movie, could have found a better person for the job.
This looks like one of those rare good Adam Sandler movies
Adam Sandler is one of my favorite actors! I was beginning to wonder when he was gonna come out with a new movie... so glad that i saw this trailer.
SPACE SPIDERS.....EWWWWW. That would scare the hell outta me.
You can do it!! Is what he will hear when walking towards the shuttle.
meh
ummm...pass.
I appreciate Adam Sandler as a serious, dramatic actor far more than a comedic actor. To me, he’s simply not funny, just loud and obnoxious. But he is super talented and criminally underrated in dramatic roles.
Astronaut go VROOM VROOM🙃😁
When the alien who is communicating to you telepathically, to ease your loneliness, chooses a spawn of Ungoliant as it's avatar, perhaps you are better off just crying alone instead.
Hard Pass.
Lunch Lady Land in Space
So it’s all in his head is the plot twist?
Shit looks stupid
Just a couple of things, Adman refuses to wear big boy pants to space attire, which is ok. Also, isn't this like "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mindz" where the main character has their mind erased/ losses their mind and starts seeing things? Lastly, who will be the first to say why didn't they use a real Russian actor for this part? Adam Sandler is a comedian and shouldn't be taken seriously especially in a serious drama. Not me! I love him and looking forward to watching it. New Netflix movies have been sucking lately.
I appreciate when Adam steps into these serious roles.. comedians like him, Robin Williams, even Jim Carey have true acting talent.
I have done as a practice in life 11 months in isolation and it certainly changes you
When I saw that bigass spider no just no im gonna initiate self-destruct
If I saw a giant talking spider in zero gravity, I'd open the airlock. We're both going down with the ship.
WOW WOW
Wow. Literal goosebumps.
It s based on the book "spaceman of bohemia"!
One eye symbolism
But why the Gill Sans ultrabold for the title? Film looks great.
He's gonna bang the alien 100%
FINALLY Billy Madison 2.
Is it me or is Adam Sandler finally no longer privying us of Adam Sandler? The Oscar's people must be eating their words by now.
Imagine going all the way to space only to find out you're trapped with a spider worse than anything Australia could throw at you
Masonic puppet!!!
Anyone who knows this version of Moonlight sonata?
This looks like it'll be good but I'm too scared of spiders😭😭
no idea what to expect..
This creature's voice actor is Paul Dano btw, so excited to watch this movie
risky decision adding a spider. might put people off due to fear.
Top 2 Movies where Adam sandler isn´t a comedian  No.2
SpiderMan: way away from home.
Color me intrigued
Dave Chappelle: "Space J3ws" is real.
Starting the year with Paul Dano doing ASMR  Glorious
Ffs, imagine having serious Arachnophobia but yet still wanting to see this film
Kevin James is way hairier than i remember
Judeman
I hahe read the book. Its fictional book lokated in a place where I come from and where I live. I am afraid that some of the things from the book will be left out from the movie. It was a book basicly about my life. (minor things were different. Prochazka left for space, i left for different country, but the conseqoences were the same). Not sure if the comunist past will be in the movie, but I was young when comunists were here and it influenced me a little different, but it did... I HOPE IT IS GOOG :-)
Oh shit this looks good haha
Spider makes me think of Project Hail Mary :-)
Looks great but can’t watch a spider, noooo thank you.
Gddamn a sentient spider.
Thought to myself. Can’t wait to see this in the cinema then realised it’s netflix
Is it just me
Thoughts this was a Project Hail Mary adaptation for a second
He is gonna steal from aliens or hunt palestinians
theres a certain magnetism that gets you hooked to your screen anytime adam sandler takes on a serious role. this looks very deep and touching. cant wait to watch this
A giant, wise, space faring jumping spider? Yes, please! This looks delightfully different. I can’t wait to check it out.
Nope. Wanna see Adam Sandler in a serious role, but can't do spiders.
Adam Sandler is underrated in drama roles. He knocked it out of the park with uncut gems like Jim Carry did in the Truman Show. The funniest people on the planet live in the darkest corners. I'm excited to see Sandler in a serious role again. I'm happy for him.
As a 30 Rock fan I can't help but be a bit disappointed by this.
“I did not mean to scare you skinny human” quote of the movie.
I am aware that im potrayed as the main character in some of these movies, yes, i figured that out in 2017.  And as the main character of these movies. Stop making these shitty, depressing, boring, endless corny ass movies, 75% of these movies fuckin suck.  start making adventure movies with more upbeat epic vibes, more comedies about somethin thats actually funny with characters u actually enjoy watching.
Andy Weir is going to be upset because this is a rip-off of Project Hail Mary
I'd love to see this film!  But unfortunately there's a giant f-off spider in most of it.
Такое же дерьмо как и чернобыль?
Space station 69: the film
This looks like an awesome Sci Fi movie.
why does it look like a dumb spider tho
and then a spider showed up....nope, fireeeeee
More Netflix junk
С метровым пауком в замкнутом пространстве😮, Это должен был быть Dead Space😂
Anything with Spider 🕷️ Im all in. I loved him in Eight Legged Freaks, Arachnaphobia, and Into the Spiderverse.  Should be another cosmic banger! 🤘
Yeah I only listed to the audio of this because I can't bear to look at spiders
u knwo the jim dude that fcks teh pie in american pie is not adam sandler , and if these space doesent exist , why not make good and make this movie.
Paul Dano voicing is perfection
Como tenga final de drama, ya me muero con esta pelicula. Los finales felices están muy vistos
I missed : thats a huge bitch somewhere in the background
Finally Aragog got his own movie.
Terrific!
Why a giant spider 😭
I thought that was rocky for a minute
Hell no I ain’t messing with freaking space spiders …noooope
Jesus… stick to comedy…
Ah.. more fake space propaganda.  Fun times!  Gotta keep these types of movies coming out to keep yall programmed...  don't forget your booster and fluoride water!
👽🍆
It has a giant spider. Nooooppppee!
Is there a message attached to this or is it just entertainment
1:40 - The Benningtons point at the screen.
So funny I thought he was imagining the alien lol
Anyone else got Project Hail Mary vibes from seeing the alien?
We need more directors to watch the anime Planetes so they'd stop making crap like this. "Oh no, I'm a husband going into space for the better part of the decade! WHY DIDN'T I REALIZE THAT SOONER!"
Welp I can't watch that.
I hope he gets in shape after this random joke of a netflix future background noise of a movie
Read this book 📖
looks genuinely interesting.  Vibes of cult classic 'Moon'
I haven’t gone to the movie theater in years but I would like to go watch this movie in the theater on a big screen
So sorry but all I hear in the first few seconds is Yves Guillemot's voice. 😅
Rob Schneider is a spider from space
that spider is a keeper
WWWWWWWW
Babe I know your already on your knees. But this story of Adam Sandler in space and his emotional support spider is really getting to me right now. Though seriously it's great seeing actors explore outside there usual range.
Cosmic movies is one of the best when done right especially this preview
Looks great but can we replace the spider with a bunny
I'm sensing a strong 'Project Hail Mary' vibe. Stealing its thunder.
(Old man yelling at the clouds here)  This should be in a theater
Is this Project Hail Mary rip off? With the alien reading guy's mind so that it's not a straight plagiarism?
oh man. this looks soo cool.  i can't believe I have to wait till march. it sounds really interesting and I always support Adam.  I hope this  is another hit for him
This looks GOOD!
He must be desperate, this looks stupid.
This looks incredible
I think this is going to be a "Richard Parker" situation.
Skinny human? says a spider.
Ive been in involuntary isolation since i was 8. Send me to space. Big whoop.
guys my friend is acting in this movie <33
missed opportunity not using Electric Callboys Spaceman
This trailer doesn't make me think it'll be a good movie. It might be ok though....
Why does EVERYTHING have to look washed out and bleak nowadays??? Don't tell me its bc its a drama, its even comedies and shows.
This movie is something special I think. Adam is awesome and this is going to be a career highlight for him.
u want him in a serious role..and you add a talking spider...l..o..l
You know when comedians Stars in a serious role it hits different like you can't explain
"Skinny human"? Yeah no, lol 😂
YOU WERE TOLD TO STAY IN THE SHIP, AND AVOID ANY THOUGHTS THAT FEEL SPIDERY
At least no US-American involved 🤣
He loses it only after 6 months??
this is going to be one of the best of 2024❤
Why a spider, it will put people of going,
What the f was that? I'm not gonna watch it. I hate spiders 😑
I read Project Hail Mary too!
Adam needs to play more serious role like this.  He is a brilliant actor!
I'm shocked to say that this looks... good?  Netflix does such a fine job of screwing things up that I'm dubious but...
Spaceman.  I always want you to go.  Into space, man.
Looks great. My arachnophobia will make me never watch it.
If Kafka‘s Metamorphosis was in space
So that's where Adam Sandler's been all these years..
With the spider this movie gives me a Project Hail Mary vibe, but it seems to be more psychological.
Я надеюсь в этом фильме Сендлер не трахнул паука словив глюкана, а то я вдруг сразу вспомнил фильм Гильермо Дель Торо с ихтиандром
Meh
I'm getting some STRONG Eternal Sunshine vibes here! I want to see this!
It's like Moon meets A Deepness in the Sky.
Güzel bı film iyi seyirler 🎉🎉
Looks good but I think it will have a sad ending and the world is already too sad atm.
Sounds like the song i made a few years back…. Ima space man AUTMUSE
That spider boutta freak ppl our
I definitely prefer him in straight acting roles as opposed the the goofy stuff
Hail Mary by Andy weir
1) On what planet is Adam Sandler "skinny?" 2) This is what happens when a man with no ideas reads Project Hail Mary.
You can do eeeeet.
...where's the funny? I don't need drama
Does anyone know the name of the song?
Stay ...
The Book is fantastic! Great expectations for the Movie!
Try to explain that to the world
Hopefully it isn't a rip-off of Andy Weir's Hail Mary.....
So much talented 💯
Cof Cof... Children of Time Cof Cof...
AT LAST!! A REAL MOVIE
Love seeing Adam sandlot in a serious role he always smashes it tbf 🙌🏼
Looks awesome
Looks interesting. Now where is any updates about Old Guard 2?!
why is it a spider
Damn thought this was project Hail Mary for a moment.
Oh hell naw!!!
Well I love Sandler but traveling to space to talk to a spider, I don't know. I hope I'm wrong, for the record I also thought a movie with a talking tree and racoon sounded dumb as well and look how that turned out.
Looks good but I cannot watch a giant spider in a confined area
This looks absolutely incredible. There’s not 1 dramatic role of Sandler I haven’t ever liked. Punch drunk love is still one of my favorite movies ever till this day
So basıcally a huge spıder...yeah, I'ma pass.
Wasn't there a star trek episode that had a similar premise? I really hope this is good
Looks like it will be immaculate💯
Interesting. Hopefully Adam Sandler can get his head out of his ass and actually make another good movie like punch drunk love. Most of his stuff is garbage. But from time to time you can see an actual actor there. The only downside is I'm not a big fan of spiders...... But we'll see
Who is eagerly waiting for this raise hands 👇👇
1:40 - THAT'S THE NAME OF THE MOVIE!
okay who else thought this was going to be a comedy and then got scared
Güzel ve iyi bir film keyifli
I want Adam Sandler to win an Oscar.
i just clicked on the video because of the czech flag in the thumbnail and i am suprised looks like a good movie not a typical adam sandler movie
что он там принял на своем корабле
This dude is just begging for an Oscar nomination.
Adam Sandler is underrated in drama roles. He knocked it out of the park with uncut gems like Jim Carry did in the Truman Show. The funniest people on the planet live in the darkest corners. I'm excited to see Sandler in a serious role again. I'm happy for him.
If is from netlix, its trash😂
I'd have a heart attack if I saw a spider that big talking to me!
Its not going to be good the movie is awful u can tell a non comedy Space Adam Sandler Movie Ew!
6 months is rookie numbers
Obvious Oscar bait. And really 2 hours of this? That face and a giant spider. Kaaaat. An actor's favorite film: they're in every scene.  And we think we've had enough of Adam Sandler's face and nepotism. He's done good work with serious roles with Spanglish and punch drunk love. But this looks like a swing and a miss so This will be a pass.
Sandler in space just isn't sitting right.
Ok..
Why a spidy tho , im see who see it with me
Spaceperson
Adam Sandler in serious movie!!!! I'm out
Anybody under this post NOT just handing this amazing man his flowers should just unlive !!! Cuz he amazing EVERY ROLE A HIT!
Bu filmi izlemeyen çok şey kaybeder
Gross he will have sex with a spider😂
y a kosmonaut? y a spider?  ....hard pass
He misses his wife,then shows his hand  Yea, I can see that😂
Station 69?
its a spy messing withhis head using psychic powers.
This has a weirdly strong Project Hail Mary vibe.
At first, I was thinking letting all that water float around is kinda unrealistic because it's not safe to have water just floating around all those electronics. Then, a talking spider showed up. Lol
The trailer already captivated me Adam playing a more serious role seem enticing
Thought this movie was based on Project Hail Mary for a second
Reminds me of that one love death & robots episode
Adam Sandler don't miss,... Uncut gems was a masterpiece. I'm sure he is cooking with this one too.
The man can't act, I'll pass just based on the casting.
A movie about an alien giving an astronaut therapy for his failing marriage, sign me up.
Aksiyon dolu😮
...Enemy 2?
Uzay filmleri hep ilgi çekici olmuştur süper
MF really said: "You want Project Hail Mary and Children of Time movies? I can do it faster."
Hmmm, interesting..... Hope the story nor the director disappoints
Beyond the Aquila Rift
So who does Kevin James play?
Really nice set design.
Wow ❤awesome ♥️ 👌🏻
title drop in the trailer lmao
So this is just Project Hail Mary but worse?
He should remain on doing roles like this and leave the comedy out just saying. 💯
Solaris 2? The sequel I never knew I wanted?
Yall saying this is a serious role 😅 Dudes on a space trip with a talking spider who’s in his mind causing hallucinations
That thing looks like a spider.  So much for my wife watching it with me. :P
Hope it will be a great movie
whats with comedians making awesome serious space movies first sandra bullock now sandler, sigh... take my money
Seems like a spin on the short story Beyond the Aquila Rift
Wow... PLEASE don't suck... very promising.
I’m in!
great
I care for all the lost souls that end up here Tom
Looks like his best film in a while. Reminds me of an sudiobook I listend to by Andy Weir caled Hail Marry - which was amazing.
I loved happy gilmore, but Adam man you have grown up. Nothing will ever be better than Happy Gilmore though
Why did it have to be a Spider? Why? 😩
Holy Spider!!! sheesh..
Had to be a f**king spider..
It's just another accident on station 69
2001 a space Odyssey Apollo 13 now spaceman...... Looks like interstellar meets the Truman show
Uh, they should get an introvert in this kind of mission. If you'll spend $$$ you gotta increase the chance of success, duh?! And get someone who meditates. Then it won't matter much how long he stay there.
I would like to thank my Lord and Savior, Lord God Almighty. *Revelation 22:13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End. John 10:30 I and the Father are one.* Save your souls. By the way, the Lord is 13 feet tall.
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Paul Danos voice is so soothing
wtf is this cringe shit? lmao
good grief... a giant talking spider, utter rubbish and adds substance as to why i cancelled netflix
sci-fi for women
Looks good
Lol Adam Sandler in space, please tell me this is a comedy
Hayallerin ötesinde bir film
I have a problem with a 6-month, SOLO, research mission. That's just so ridiculous and I can't stop thinking about it - nobody is ever going to do that. Then, Sandler's character looks so unfit...come on. Such a shame.
Eh, Idk about this one.  First off; if Adam is playing an astronaut that "obviously" volunteered" for this mission the trailer shows, WHY on earth would you do this mission at a crucial time that your fixing your marriage?  Also Im not an astronaut myself but I have read and done enough research to know that when these guys go into space, they go through intense training prior to heading off to a space station and with that they are trained not to fear, worry, or focus on family business when it comes to work related business.  I mean, sure; Nasa usually will provide methods of live feed or recorded messages the astronauts are allowed to send back to their families from time to time as a "hello from space" message but in most cases both sides of the families understand that the father/husband, etc are out doing their job.  All Im seeing in this trailer is a guy who had a rough marriage and decides "Well, off to space I go to get away from it all" and then all of a sudden as he's out in space for this xxx days mission, he suddenly is "Lonely" and decides then he wants to fix his marriage and be with his wife.  To me that is pretty lame and dumb of a story to write up on; but to each their own I guess.  Think I'll pass on this one.
I'm trying to imagine the discussion. "We need a new movie idea" "EMOTIONAL SUPPORT SPIDER! No, hear me out..."
This gives me SOLARIS vibes.
me: this looks like a interesting movie. Sees large spider. me: ok f**k this movie, I'm not watching it.
This trailer gave me goosebumps. I love that Adam Sandler is stepping out of his own shadow and doing more dramatic roles, and I love the originality behind this story. Can’t wait to see this
This reminds me of an episode of love death and robots where an astronaut got stranded after going through a wormhole and he was trapped by an arachnid life form who would mentally simulate a good life for him instead of let him suffer until he died.
Ever since I have been alive I have not seen him ever play in a movie like this. I GOT TO SEE. THIS I WOULD HAVE NEVER EXPECTED I'm so intrigued and stoked. Such an underrated actor practically known just for his a+ comedy roles
Thanks to Beethoven, Moonlight Sonata took this trailer to anothel level...If you noticed
Would have rathered "WILSON"
This film looks to be right up my alley.  It'll be weird watching Adam Sandler play a serious role.  At first, I didn't realize it was him the trailer.
i think it's sad to see so many struggling actors and then this same ones who hog up space on the big screen for 40 years.  seriously give other actors a chance.  these movies are un-believable ..... in a bad way... i cannot see past these familiar faces and never get lost into the characters
is it just me or does this seem really really similar to the book project hail mary
That looks absolute crxp. Was hoping for a good space movie untill a spider came into it and helps his emotions 😂🙈 oh dear..
Adam Sandler has been on a roll in the last years. Ditching comedy for actually good dramas. His track record is restoring itself. Looking forward to this.
When I saw the alien, I got excited and thought "project hail Mary!" I am disappoint.
Seems like half of the concept was "inspired" by the book Project Hail Mary.
WTF
Alien spiders are no joke!!!
Can’t watch a spider for 2 hours  I’m good off that 😅
Nice.  A modern day version of Charlotte's Web.  The wise spider imparts life lessons.
I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife..
It had to be a spider huh?
This looks really interesting
About to be nominated for an Oscar.
oooo space spider
Paul Dano as a giant space spider? I'm intrigued but my arachnophobia forbids me from watching

Acid is one crazy Drug
Why did it have to be spideers ? :/
Solaris but worse
Who are the ad wizards that came up with this one?
I love how Adam Sandler, after years of making low brow comedies to set him and his friends for life, started to show others his actual acting skill
What garbage
Adam Sandler looks like hes doing good these days.
a F#$%g spider really ????  Why ??
The depth and complexity of this interaction is fascinating. With loneliness and hope intermixed, it evokes a profound understanding of the human condition, particularly in isolation. The dual narrative highlights the eternal struggle between exploration and yearning for home.
I think many people will love Honus's philosophical thoughts. Then many people will cry. I'm sure many people with depression will find themselves with certain thoughts. It's very good that Honus is not a space grotesque alien, but just a cute spider. The most anticipated premiere from Netflix for me. The photos and atmosphere are somewhat reminiscent of Soderberg's "Solaris"
Madness-inducing giant spiders are tight!
I'm glad to see Aragog finaly being appreciated as a fulfilled actor and being casted in a major movie and not just as Hagrid's pet.
Not for me  ( dislike ) 👎🏻😏
Somebody read project hail mary and decided to steal its premise
Looks terrible!
creepy friggin trailer
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nobody wants to know if the spiders real?
From the description for this video: “Directed by Johan Renck and based on the novel Spaceman of Bohemia”. Nothing to do with Andy Weir’s novel _Hail Mary Pass_ , which came out four years after _Spaceman of Bohemia_ . There is a completely separate production for _Hail Mary Pass_ , which is scheduled to start filming later this year.
reminds me of that one love death and robots episode
Adam Sandler was fantastic in Uncut Gems, the only serious role I've seen him in.   So maybe this could be a good movie.
This looks very interesting. Appreciate Netflix making more original and thought provoking films like this. In contrast Disney just remaking old cartoons into poor live action films. Amazon…well, WH40K universe could be amazing not going to lie!
So...Adam Sandler goes to Australia, basically?
LETS GO, ANOTHER ADAM SANDLER MOVIE
It takes more intelligence and wit to make a funny comedy than dirge like this.
İzlemenizi şiddetle tavsiye ederim
Help. This looks like it’s gonna be heartbreaking
I first thought this was knock off of Andy Weirs book Project Hail Mary when I saw alien but its not at all. Looks promising and AS is a really good dramatic actor.
Мем про польскую ракетную программу зашел слишком далеко
Let's make a scifi movie only let's not make a scifi movie. :/
Babylon Zoo.
Looks boring space movie again like gravity!!
Adam Sandlers role in switch was the first movie I ever cried while watching.. Sandler knows how to hit you in the feelings for sure.
I used to think Adam Sandler was another Hollywood hack, until I watched Uncut Gems and other old movies. The guy is genuinely funny and talented, he made it and now makes movies with his buddies and underrated treasures...Nothing but respect
i love u paul dano
This reminds me of that Love Sex Robot Episode
Nope in spaaaaaaceeee
good one
I hope this is turns out to be a good movie
6 months does that to a professional ? I think they must reform their recruiting system! if it was 1 year and above i understand, but 6 months for a dedicated astronaut seems short...
movie or series?
i was hoping for Hubie Halloween 2 😭
I thought that was a Philippines Flag in the thumbnail so i clicked..
The spider is reminding me of  'Children of Time' and 'Project Hail Mary'.
Weird but cool
Was that a god damn space spider, hell nah
I usually don't watch trailers because those reveal too much. This time I decided to watch it half way and i am quite shocked that 99% of trailers nowadays reveal big part of the movie. I feel like some people are getting stupid and some more greedy. Peaces.
If I get contacted  by an alien, I will ask him about black holes, string theory, relativity, etc. Things that I know nothing.
Wow, this looks good. The story kind of reminds me of 'Beyond The Aquilla Rift' from 'Love, Death + Robots'. If you give Adam Sandler the right material, and the right director, he's one of the best actors out there.
Watched this movie about 3 months ago and I absolutely loved it! Can't wait to watch it again! Easily my favorite Adam Sandler movie!
Look forward seeing this movie! Adam Sandler was in my hometown in Spokane WA not so long ago.
I love a New York-Jewish Czech guy flying in space. Super believable
Please 🙏🙏🙏 Hindi dubbed this movie
Now let's see The Rock take on a movie project like this.... never gonna happen! lol
Ladies and Gentleman, this is the new era for Adam Sandler and we're all here for it.
Starfield with spider?
Adam Sandler about to become Spider Astronaught. I'm in
He's totally dying up there.
this a remake of a very good space movie they have no new movies to make only wash ups wat a waste of money
This looks terribly boring.
Spider..big spider.. nope nope nope nope...sorry Adam Sandler but i don´t watch this movie -.-*
"Goodbye, friends of Hagrid..."
I THINK NETFLIX IS VERY MUCH LOVES ADAM SANDLER.HE HAS BEEN DOING WELL WITH NETFLIX
So they took many phobias and turned it into one big movie :)) cool
I'm glad to see Anansi finally being appreciated as a fulfilled actor and being cast in a major movie and not just being stuck in childrens books.
Whenever Adam Sandler does a serious role he always does amazing in it.
One thing about Netflix.. when they hire these Triple A class actors, its very rare they miss and this movie with them putting Adam Sandler back into a emotion filled rolled.. i cant wait to see what this all turns out to be
HAHA good luck arachnophobia people
Am I dreaming or we have Solaris with Adam Sandler now? Hyped
Stupid.
The Perks of Being a Wallflower meets The Neighbors meets The Martian. At least those are the vibes I’m getting from this trailer. It really blows your mind away.
This reminds me of that love death and robots episode
I'll watch anything Carey Mulligan is in. Most beautiful and talented actress working right now.
This looks like a really tacky and poor attempt to replicate how good MOON was on pure spectacle without needing to bother with any of the nuance or actual intrigue that made MOON brilliant...
This man....IS DA MAN!!!!  Great job!!!!
Yeh but why the tarantula?
Can he go back to his big daddy, happy Gilmore, Billy Madison days 😅. These films look boring 🥱
Adam Sandler - wow. He is such a powerfull actor ...
Looks kinda lame.
This one eye thing is too much man. I just cannot ignore it anymore.
Officially currently 1.8 million views, with a current 40,000 likes. That puts this movie somewhere in-between crap and okay/slightly boring. Bots been busy liking other comments I see lol.
I doubt my friends from Germany would watch this....  big spider , They are not a on it
1000 people with arachnophobia disliked this video
is this adam sandlers first serious movie.  From the trailer iam thinking oscar nomination. 1:49 is that the jellyfish UFO.
That looks like shit. Sorry
🔥
Czech mentioned 🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿!!
This looks beautiful
Daaaayum, Adam Sandler going for that Oscar, this looks really good
From all the things, they chose a spider ? what ? Could barely watch the trailer lol
I Love Adam Sandler ❤😊
Yung akala mo flag ng pinas sa unang tingin.
For a second, I thought they made a movie version of "Hail Mary", the amazing novel from Andy Weir who also wrote the "The Martian". "Hail Mary" is 10 times better than the "The Martian" and would make for an epic movie. Unfortunately, this Sandler movie is not based on that story. Seems more love drama than SF.
Bildiniz bütün filmleri unutturcana eminim harikadınız
wtf yes please
THAT SPIDER READS A LOT OF BOOKS.
PLEASE MAKE HIM STOP!!!!! UHHGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
WHY ARE THEY ALLOWING THIS GUY TO ACT - HE GOT FIRED FOR NOT EVEN BEING FUNNY ON SNL -  TERRIBLE - AND HE IS FILTHY RICH??? I JUST DO NOT GET IT AT ALL!!!!
He was on Epstein island. He was talking about pizza a lot too. I mean it’s obvious he was a pedo. When is Netflix gonna blacklist these people ??
This looks great, I'm kinda stoked to see Adam in another serious role
Reminds me of that Love Death & Robots episode.
Why don't you just bring a video device with ton of game in it. Just legend of zelda alone could take you more than 100 days to complete.
This is giving me beyond the aquila rift vibes 😢
So KennyS is into acting now
CZ can into space 😅
This looks amazing... but man... it gives alot of Project Hail Mary vibes
I bet the spider is feeding off of him and slowly killing him
All aboard the Project Hail Mary hype train
Astral spiders are a things so. I'm intrigued now.
I hope it lays its eggs in him 😊
Please get Oscar this time Adam Sandler
oh no he's stuck at the aquila rift isnt he
Çok güzel bir film yavsiye ederim
I was just thinking that Adam Sandler will finally play in a serious movie until the giant spider showed up...
Cool concept. I dig it
I'm rightfully cautious of any Adam Sandler movie; he either hits it out of the park of face-plants. This looks like it might be quite good, we'll see...
Aragog is still alive!
Adam Sandler is top 10 actor. Cant wait for this movie to come out. Good choise Netflix
...and i'd love to see sandler get a statue
Remembered Chinese movie Moon man, but this seems serious
I know Adam Sandler is a good actor and has done well in dramas, but I kept waiting for this trailer to turn into a comedy.
I see Helen is still with Adam
adam sandler in space getting emotional support from a giant spider... here, take my money!
Not-project hail mary, the movie
Shout out to Paul Dano for killing the voice for this
If this makes me cry like Click did, I’m all for it lol
Nice ⭐️
The spider should have been a penguin. 😉 “look what we have here, that silly penguin is back again. “
Zippity do!
NOPE
Looks like the perfect cast for 'Project Hail Mary'
Space man makes friend with giant spider and be very happy. Sounds about right! 😅
Paul Dano as the space spider, sign me up
Can't wait, gonna be great!
bu fragman tüylerimi diken diken etti adam ın oyunculu filmin akıcılığı gerçekten bayıldım izleme değer bir film ve gerçektende insanı ekrana kilitliyor
Looks promising!
186 days? Welp, time to catch up with One Piece.
Adam Sandler as citizen of Czech Republic 😅
Looks like another gem
adam sandler sure is a choice
Boring
Watch the ending be a whole dream sequence and it ends up being a waste of 2 hours of watching another pointless movie 🤣. Looks like one of those types of movies.
Take some mushrooms 🍄  should be a fun ride 😉
Adam sandler must be filming in outer space of Australia...
what is that moonlight sonata version where can i find that??
Hope this does not end up being a bad version of Solaris
watch its gonna win a raspberry award on break the _good Adam Sandler movie_ streak after past bad films he made
wow...it looks nice
she said it, she said it!
I might have horrible Arachnophobia, BUT I’m willing to check this out because the story sounds very interesting and quite emotional. And after seeing Sandler’s performance in Uncut Gems, it’s the reason why I’m watching this.
Had me till the giant spider creature. My arachnaphophobia went nuts. Friendly real or illusionary 8-legged freak is going to be sprayed with a can of Raid.
Looks like a great movie, can't wait to watch it..
Is crazy how Adam is such a great drama actor
Nope. I was excited until I saw the spider. I can't. Couldn't even watch the trailer.
Aşırıya iyi olmuş keyifle izledim 🎉
look like in 2024 is wake up and starting to do good movies
I think I saw that spider on DMT
You lost me at the giant puppet.
Actor who mostly starred in total crap films, paired with an actress who delivers the same dull performance time and time again, yet somehow this could still very watchable if the trailers anything to go by!
amongus
looks wild
Can anyone tell me Who made this version of moonlight sonata
here Sandler floating on a tin can...  far above the world... planet earth is blue... Sandler is too...  being devoured by a spider from mars
This looks so good, I cannot wait. This will be the first Adam Sandler movie I've seen where he's in a serious role!
Emotional damage. Spider: Hello, there.
The Space Spider reminds me of Andy Weir's book Project Hail Mary. But this looks good in its own right....well the trailer looks good.
1:40 Ah ah she said it she said it !  - Peter Griffin
This is either gonna be really bad or really good
Alter Sandler,was versuchst hier? Ein FETTER Astronaut,der halus bekommt?! Selbst deine Komödien sind sehr lahm geworden und jetzt einen auf Oscarboy🤣🤣?! Bist ein Witz geworden und Netflix produziert ehh nur SCHEISSE!!
Okay...Houston, we have a "situation" here.  I was sure this must be a comedy, but clearly it is not.  Gotta check this one out.
Why is this similar to Project Hail Mary?!
Sandler really is trying to pull off his own What Dreams May Come, and it may just work.
I much prefer Adam Sandler in these kind of roles.
Interesting 🤔
The bug's voice sounds like the Ghost of Christmas Past from Jim Carrey's 'A Christmas Story'.
I Think A Movie where a Space Guy gets lost in Space and goes into a Black Hole and comeout the other End seeing Actual Heaven and finding his Wife there and tries to get her to go back with him but shes too happy there but hes not ready to leave his kids Behind on earth ..  something like that maybe cool
Looks familiar. One of the very best "Love, Death & Robots" Beyond the Aquila Rif
This seems like one kookie movie but the good kind of kookie that Adam Sandler can pull off
In love death robots there’s a space spider who also connects with humans emotions and dreams. Is there some meta conscious notion about space spiders and dreams/emotions I don’t know about???
Finally a movie with Adam Sandler in which he does not act like a moron.
Totally give me "Project Hail Mary" vibes i cant wait
Comedy gold!
It’s crazy how many people still don’t know it’s all about the DIRECTORS! Not the actors.
🙄🙄🙄🙄
Seriously WTF
The acting of the spider in this is mind blowing.
This looks fantastic. Way to go sandman🎉
Am I the only one who thinks this is lil similar to Project Hail Mary?
Huge spider?! No thanks!
Might be worth pirating.
Why is this not in theaters?! Now I'll never see it.
I swear to God, I would fast track myself out the space lock SO FAST 😱
Finally, a live action Evillak!
Yoo this looks great
I'm not buying the premise. No space program is going to subject an astronaut to that kind of isolation, knowing the deleterious psychological effects it would have. So I can't buy the rest of the movie either. Pass.
Wow
I'm so happy they are giving the spider a role he was born for! He's going to knock it out of the park!
Is this based on the book: ‘Project Hail Mary’? Cuz I thought Ryan gosling was the lead
Another boring space movie. And Adam Sandler? Seriously?
Let's begin a soothing space walk...love this plot❤
Adam fans assemble here
Looks really compelling and interesting but I shrieked every time the spider showed up in this trailer.
Now we're in zero gravity Just spinning round and round The next thing you know I'm right side up And Yuri's upside down
Although people interpret spider dreams in different ways, there’s no scientific evidence to suggest that spider dreams mean anything at all. But popular interpretations of spiders in dreams include:  - regressive attitudes and behaviors that are keeping you from reaching your full potential  - feminine energy, women, or mother figures  - feelings of vulnerability, anxiety, or fear in your waking life
SHOCKED...TELL YOU I'M SHOCKED that Netflix didn't force the movie producers of this movie to change it to "Spacehuman"
This is space madness . Maybe he stayed in orbit too long. It could be something if the spider was real
if he is not telling a joke or at least urinating on a spaceship wall, I am not watching it
While this trailer looks great, the story seems to have some major similarities to the novel Project Hail Mary.
is he gonna sex the spider?
Is this based loosely on the book "Children of Time?"
Ungoliant has respawned and wants to make friends with humans!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Favorite since childhood ADAM SANDLER - Name is enough
Undisputed actor of the world !
Looks very good,  I hope they did not insert DEI woke shit in it.  At least the arachnid doesn't have pink hairs, and not "fighting patriarchy" sign.  For now.
I think you'll find it's pronounced Spa-che-min
Spidey looks friendly atleast XD
And I would ne excited to check this out. If it wasn't Netflix. You know what will happen they bait us with sandler and depth and they give us some trope of men being completely inconsiderate and women needing to save the day. Plus a whole lot of pandering and attempts at audience shaming. Or worse it's full bait and switch and Sandler is back benched and the show is all about the women and we literally just watched every scene with him in. 🤦‍♀️  Tell me when it goes to DVD.
This is giving 'Upgrade" vibes. That movie where the AI takes over the main character's body at the end. I feel like that spider creature might take over the guy for unknown reasons.
I hear this is going to be banned in Nopelandia, think I'll hang out there for a while.😱
Anything this man does is worth more than its weight in diamonds 💎
There better be a good reason why they chose a spider.  Suspension of disbelief is the first thing you need from good sci-fi.  I can't possibly believe in space spiders, and I doubt this takes place in the Wizarding World universe of Harry Potter.
It's pronounced Spa che men.
can't wait for his next movie to be 'Jungo the farting treesniffer', that definitely has a cameo from rob schnieder.
Loved it the first time in 2022 when it was called Glorious ..jus this one takes place in space and has a bigger budget
This looks awesome
Adam needs to stop doing comedy because he's terrible at it and just do drama's
Es cine
why a spider though?
spaceman.. but also kinda spider man.
Paul Dano can play any role!
Right now, on trending.. it’s #2  Brent Rivera is #1    Bro, this is so much better
Nothing scarier than a space spider!
Looks like the question will be is the spider alien real or imagined.
He misses his wife
What are those time stamps?
A spider? It’s gotta be a hallucination, right?!
I like how Sandler makes silly and frankly, bad comedy movies with his pals, knowing they're bad comedy movies, but he keeps on making them, just to chill and have fun with his friends and they'll be profitable because his movies have an audience no matter how bad they can be. Now, he also likes to get serious and really do some work every once in a while, making us all remember how good he is as an actor
Definitely Watching
Meh
How is this different from Solaris?
This is so stupid
Please Chinese drama hindi mein daal do
Fat Adam Sandler floating in space.
Would you like to hear some good news? This is the best news you'll hear. Everyone, including you and me, has sinned and falls short of God's glory (Romans 3:23). And because the wages/punishment of sin is death (Romans 6:23), you are headed for Hell for eternity. But because God loves you, He graciously offers you the gift of Eternal Life through Jesus Christ. Jesus, as God in the flesh, died for your sins on the cross. He took the punishment you deserve, and He rose again on the 3rd day. If you believe this and confess that Christ is Lord, then you are saved (Romans 10:9,10),  and regardless of what you may have done, there is no condemnation for you if you are in Christ Jesus (Romans 8:1). You are saved by what Jesus did on the cross, not what you do. Salvation is simple and free. "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life."
Oprah Winfrey was also on Jeffrey Epstein‘s list
Pretty sure a giant spider was not on my 2024 bingo card.
why do all the new movies suck so badly? what is hollywood mad about the truth coming out? stop makin all these whack depressing movies and make something thats actually enjoyable to people besides depressed middle aged government agents
I'm looking forward to seeing this movie. I love it when Adam sandler does dramatic work
"I hope this is a good movie"... Really I'm over hoping for that. I'd settle for it just not being awful in every way, shape and form. Yeah, that's where we're at now with big production films from the all knowing, God-like Hollywood these days...  It MIGHT be OK. It absolutely won't be GOOD. Big money, big production, big name stars ALWAYS equate to BIG FLOP. As if a giant spider speaking English to an astronaut was supposed to somehow make me wonder.  Obviously the damn spider doesn't actually exist. So what contrived plot have you come up with? All in his head? Snoooooooze. More garbage scripts from the same garbage writers. I'm over it.
He was in Jeffery Epsteins list…
I didn’t know Project Hail Mary was coming out so soon
Adam Sandler in a serious role with an interesting sci fi plot in a time where it's rare to find good sci fi. And it seems to have this cerebral quality of having to wonder if he is crazy or not. Sign me up.
Hmm, looks like this could be intere---- AHHHH!!!! Why? Why put a massive tarantula in a movie?!?! Arachnophobia out!
Another gem from Adam. 😁
Don't tell me Adam Sandler fucks Alien in this movie.
Is the alien inspired by the one in Hail Mary by Andy Weir?
Actually looks amazing
Spiders, why did it have to be spiders?😉
Adam is one of my favorite comedian actors ever, and i love his more serious movies also... I look forward to this! Looks fantastic... I always like when he goes outside the comedy and does these sorts of films. I would love to see him play a detective in a horror movie or something like that also. I always said he had great range as an actor and hope this further proves this. Can't wait...
INRI ttt
another space movie.... of cource its boring
Why did it have to be spider??? 😩Man now my arachnophobia is gonna kick in watching this. Why not an ant? or a snake?
This had better either be really good or really bad.
There’s an episode of Love+Death+Robots just like this.
Siempre te da una larga vida ve a Adam Sandler
Ew why did it have to be a godamn spider?! Gonna nope tf out of this movie
finnaly one of my favorite actors its back on his prime 😎
This reminds me of that creature in the Beyond the Aquila Rift
So a man will have sex with a spider like alien. Mind blowing. A story that must be told.
Adam Sandler is Hollywood legend
This looks awful what are you all smoking.
Zohan in space now ?
This looks amazing !
A man got so lonely and misses his wife, he starts a tentacle-based relationship. As one commonly does.
“Lucas the spider” is a big boy now
Will there be pizza parties on this ship?
All I can think of is Cartman Pitching ideas as awesome-O in South Park
When that moonlight sonata theme came in I got literal chills
I have questions.
So, another spiderman movie?
Is this one of those trailers from Tropic Thunder?
I hate Adam Sandler so much.
This Netflix contract was the best thing to ever happen to Sandler fans
Ever since I saw Adam Sandler in Reign Over Me, i've been dying to see him play more serious roles. Got a bit of a fix out of Uncut Gems, I really hope this is good.
This honestly could be an episode of aqua teen.
Just by watching this movie clip this movie sucks Adam Sandler is a horrible actor
Was that a giant spider? In outer space?!
Am I the only one who thinks this looks awful?? 😂
This movie is just a big F you to people with arachnophobia
This movie looks like a flaming piece of crap 😂😂😂
I was with you until the CGI spider came out. Yeah...that's a little too weird.
Let’s gooooo
Pronouncing it like the character from 30 rock
why a spider 😭
spoilers, the spider just want to turn the ship back to earth to feed its colony spawn.
Damn... Adam Sandler about to drop another powerhouse performance!
In short, he's a scientific enigma, a psychological paradox, and a medical curiosity – Adam Sandler as the epitome of maturity with a child's mentality is a comedic blend of adult intellect and childlike innocence, navigating the complexities of life with a uniquely entertaining twist.
spoiler alert he is really just a junkie like major tom.
Im arachnophobic dudeeeee 😭😭 but still i want to watch this
Adam Sandler as the epitome of maturity with a child's mentality would involve a complex interplay of neurobiological factors is back for a new movie😂  In such a scenario, one could imagine a unique cognitive configuration where Sandler retains adult brain structures responsible for decision-making, language, and complex reasoning, while exhibiting childlike emotional responses and preferences.  Neurobiological Aspects: - The prefrontal cortex, associated with executive functions, might showcase adult-like capabilities, allowing for mature decision-making. - Limbic system alterations could contribute to childlike emotional responses, creating a peculiar blend of emotional innocence and cognitive maturity.  Psychological Aspects: - This character would likely exhibit a form of arrested emotional development, maintaining a child's sense of wonder, curiosity, and spontaneity. - Psychological defense mechanisms might be at play, shielding the individual from the stresses and responsibilities associated with true adulthood.  Medical Aspects: - Psychologically, this scenario could involve elements of regression, where certain emotional and cognitive aspects revert to a childlike state. - The character might show signs of paradoxical maturity, with adult-level intellectual capacities coexisting with childlike emotional reactions.  Social Implications: - Interactions with others could be both endearing and challenging. The character might struggle to navigate social expectations due to the mismatch between intellectual and emotional maturity. - The comedic value could stem from the character's attempts to reconcile societal norms with their unique blend of maturity and childlike innocence.  In essence, this hypothetical scenario combines scientific, psychological, and medical concepts to create a character that challenges conventional understandings of human development, offering a comedic exploration of the complexities of maturity and childlike wonder.
WHATS YOUR NAME, HE'LL WRITE IT ON THE MOON FOR YA
this is just like that one episode of Love death and robots
The Spider is one of the many symbols of Satan. From stage coaches, to porches, from LOTR to "Spaceman." aka David Bowie's Starman Bif Naked's Spaceman & Kary Perry E.T. It's Satan.  And there was Mat Damon's the Martian "Bring Him Home" Now it's Starman's "I just want to come home,"  Revelation 12 makes it clear. We're not trying to bring him home. He's cast out of the heavens, down to the Earth by the Arch Angel Michael & his righteous angels.  I bet the movie is about Satan tempting this lonely man and him having to decide. Perhaps based on a regret Sandler has about selling out to Pedowood?
You gotta be this stoned to watch this movie
Let me guess, the spider alien is actually just a lab animal that Sandler speaks to as he's hallucinating in isolation.  It'll be a "Was it all just a dream" type movie.  I'm interested, just not surprised
Wow! The sequel to Charlotte's Web looks great!
Doesn't matter if you aren't a fan of his comedy when he does drama it's so damn good
We all know he not coming home. It a one way mission.
This trailer has me so enthralled in the potential of this movie. From the emotional core of the story to the potential for cosmic horror, I’m fully locked in.
Aquila rift?
They could have done anything, but they chose a talking oversized spider ? Unbelievable
This is Major Tom to ground control. You've really made the grade ... That's right Anderson.
SO GLAD TO SEE FIDEL CASTRO IN A MOVIE. DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS INTO ACTING TOO!
I cannot watch this due to my arachnophobia
roseixovere
What the heck?? This is the most drama I've seen in an Adam Sandler movie!!!😯😲😱
Adam Sandler. The Guy who directed “Chernobyl”. Sayless.
Ain’t missing it ➰
Great book. Looking forward to seeing this.
I just watched Saltburn and Promising young woman, and I must say that Carey Mulligan is an exceptional actor. It thrills me see her
Holy shit, why does this look like a good movie to have a date night with your loved one? I love the mix of Adam Sandler and Carey Mulligan in this movie ❤❤
man this looks amazing
Uncut Gems now this Adam Sandler is a G.
Dudes movies have taken place in so many exotic and cool places, SPACE was definitely the final frontier for him!
A spider...
Those not familiar with “serious Sandler” please watch Punch-Drunk Love. He was snubbed that awards season I’ll always stand by this
I think these films suit Adam better than his comedies...
Not having his usual SNL buddies in movies really makes Adam seem like a better actor.
Adam should sing Major Tom to Ground Control in this one as well like in Mr Deeds
And here is the predictive programming movie made to get humans to begin to accept a friendly alien species that happens to look like what we know as an insect…hmm…
I'm sorry, Adam Sandler in what?  My guy said comedy who?  Not I!  Run it!
Give me all the Adam Sandler dramas!!!
Why is Lucas here????🤣
Sandler keeps PUMPING these Netflix films out.
Adam Sandler will shut so many mouths
Or  u can call it......"SPACEJEW"!!!!!!
If Adam Sandler  is in it , it will be a disappointment .  What was his last good movie ?
This is based on the book Hail Mary right?
I need a giant emotional support spider 😊🕷💕
...choosing a spider was a wack move...why not on AI Robot made from other humans from another planet.
A fat astronaut, this is real science fiction!
Why a spider?😣 ...That is gross. Of all the things they could have though put. Lol
Interesting, I like this new side of Adam’s Acting. Although I do wish they didn’t show the spider. Would’ve been a nice surprise
Looks good so far, Definitely original.
This looks stupid, yet they're taking it super seriously. I saw buzz about this so decided to check out the trail—then the giant spider showed up. This is Superman Lives all over again!!!
I am unnecessarily intrigued by both the trailer and premise in general. Very interested to see this
I was in until I saw the spider.
The Sandman in space , Spaceman
There's nothing to fear but Fear itself, and spiders.
No one is saying punch drunk love or uncut gems got bad performances out of Sandler.  That doesn't translate to put him in space.
Dang this looks great!!!
Adams non comedy roles hit different and I mean that in the best way possible 👍
Anyone else here read Project Hail Mary?
I need to know what this song is and I need it
why did it have to be a spider
I hope this is as epically bad as it looks.
Another ET something ? !
Adam Sandlers role in switch was the first movie I ever cried while watching.. Sandler knows how to hit you in the feelings for sure.
This might be the one that gets him the long overdue award.
Some situations just call for the blood of Jesus. Accept no substitutes.
Winner of the coveted Crying Monkey Award...
spaceman now pls
its like he got high and thought of this. i wonder if adam ever thinks about how much he can get away with LOL i love him for it
Hogwarts called they want their spider back...
This looks amazing!
Well this looks interesting. Nice to see Sadler in a more dramatic role, it's going on the list.
F Adam Sandler biggest Zionst ever.
this looks good
This looks legit. I hope it doesn’t disappoint
the decision to make it a spider is brilliant. Really unexpected and more "alien" than anything we could design anyway!
Is that woman supposed to look like Elon Musk?
The voice of that tarantula is so sincere and calming that it feels like it's coming from a wise person with 1000s of years of experience under his belt.
Это будет что то шедевральное!
Castaway on shrooms basically
Can not wait
You had me at Adam Sandler AND Paul Dano ❤❤❤❤
Adam sandler keeps on making shity movies on Netrix just like he did with Sony till they ditched him
I didn’t think we were capable of making original, thought provoking  movies anymore, this looks interesting !
I got Chuck Tingle vibes, please for the love of God this better not be a Netflix version on Space Raptor Butt Invasion.
I am so freaking tired of Adam Sandler with a beard.  Growing a beard does not automatically make you a dramatic actor.
So I see Adam Sandler floating in space with a bottle of vodka and I think to myself, "a Happy Madison comedy in space, brilliant!"  I was sorely disappointed.
sandler looks czech like putin looks nigerian
If you think Adam Sandler can’t do drama, look up “Reign on Me.”
Ugh… did it had to be a spider?? Pass.
wow what a rip off of project hailmary. hollywood sucks
Sorry but I smell a flop a spider alien give me a break.
Bolo jay shree ram
Alright I'll call it, he's not even in space, that's the twist
Reminds me of a Love Death and Robots from Netflix : Beyond the aquila rift.
When Adam does drama, it’s always a win.
Paul Dano and Adam Sandler is such an amazing combo
Goddamit, this is just going to be another movie where some dude loses his mind in deep space isn't it? You would think the people that are chosen to be galactic explorers would be thoroughly tested before they send them out and especially not be a man with a wife that has a baby on the way.
Ah Great, another one of those "Astronaut hallucinates about a giant space spider that gives him marital advice on a space station" type movies, get it together Hollywood and do something original😒
I hate Spider only because Adam is in there. I'll watch it.
Had me very interested until I saw the big goofy spider
Damnit!!! I'm arachnid phobic!!! How am I supposed to watch this. It looks really good!!!
so basiically this is that live action version of that love death and robots ep
Sandler is best when he’s out of the happy Maddison universe
morty - you sonnavabish im in
Project Artimas?
Is Carey Mulligan in every movie now?
Adam Sandler one of the best actors alive, if he only made drama movies ppl would recognize how good this guy is
SANDra Bullock - Gravity SANDler Adam  - Spaceman
Big ass Tarantula: Do not be afraid  Me : Yeah no Proceeds to freak out perhaps has a heart attack/faints
I wanted to see this until I saw the gigantic spider
Of all the creatures that could have been chosen....God I hate spiders
Intriguing! Adam Sandler finally flexing his chops. I feel like he's a very picky man when it comes to attaching himself to a script. This ought to be a wild ride!
I'm seeing Sally Sparrow in everything now and it's really weird.
Space spiders 😮
Imagine the pitch for this
Nah. That thing is gonna be feeding off him in some sort of way, probably pumping him full of visions via telepathy to keep him docile while he feeds.
The star maker says it ain't so bad The dream maker's gonna make you mad The spaceman says, "Everybody look down It's all in your mind"  - The Kiilers
I have no idea what just happened.
That was a really good movie, thank you.
Looks like it could be a love, death & robots episode Also seeing a good adam sandler trailer makes me suspicious that I might be in the wrong timeline
This is Andy Weir's "Project Hail Mary" but taken with a lot more liberties. Seems loose with purpose. Suspicious.
Looks like they read Project Hail Mary before they made this
Very different and intriguing. Great cast.  Dano and Sandler is such an odd coupling but this looks really good
is this how we become Humans with a capital H?
Hard pass. Sorry.
ADAM SANDLER IS THE BEST DIRECTOR, ACTOR, PRODUCER THERE EVER WILL BE!
Couldn't find a Czech actor for this role?
Yawn
Love the Brooklyn accent
Aw man, this reminds me of a new book coming to a movie. I won't mention the name, but this just feels like it lifted the protagonists from that book and placed them in this 'what if'. Maybe I'm being unfair, but it's just how it feels. This is probably too vague to mean a damn thing tho.
I'm guessing he really isn't in space at all
This gives me heavy vibes of the movie Moon with Sam Rockwell. Highly underrated film
This is so much better than those "comedies" Sandler's career had devolved into.
What are people talking about? Adam Sandler has so many movies not comedy genre.
No theatrical release? That's a bummer, this looks like a film made for cinema. Still intrigued though. Adam Sandler in a sci fi drama is the win 2024 needs
This is going to be Adam’s best picture ever
Reminds me little bit of Ad Astra how Brad Pit stock on the ship
Is this the spider from Beyond the Aquila Rift?
I hope we don’t get one of them confusing quadruple entendre endings smh 🤦🏾‍♂️
So proud of Adam Sandler, this movie looks really good.
Not saying this is a rip off, dont know enough about the plot yet to confirm, however the basic premise seems very similar to the book "Project hail mary."
This won't make me re-subscribe to Netflix.
They turned a couple lyrics from Rocket Man into a movie
Looks dumb
I'm going to watch this on mushrooms
F me in the goat a! This looks really good. Great trailer too. Radiohead!
Bet his wifey some hot Mexican again lol
reminds me an episode from Love, Death and Robots.
When's the Avatar the last Airbender official trailer?
Damn, if it wasn’t for that bloody giant spider I could watch this.
I’m so sorry but this look so weird
I love it when Netflix reminds me why I canceled my account years ago.
Glad he's doing a serious role ,talented actor 😊
Everybody keeps referencing uncut gems but let’s not forget how good Sandler was in ‘Hustle’. He really does well in serious roles.
Hell naw! giant spider!
I’m be real with u, just cause that’s a spider ima have to skip
Czechia.. Ano?? ❤
This looks great. As a lot have said Sandler was great in uncut gems so I'm looking forward to seeing him play against type again in a more serious dramatic role.
stained mattresses in space
I’m getting vibes from the movie, Moon by David Bowie’s son. Check it out if you want to see an excellent psychological spaceman movie!
I hope this won't turn out to be another sandler movie with beautiful wife chicks like all over again.
Not too shabby for the Studboy
I fuckin hate spiders, yak
Why did it have to be a spider?
Why do they gotta add cringe music to trailers.... I don't get it
Intriguing
Ugh did it have to be a giant ass spider lol
this film looks like a throw back to the blockbuster video days.
I was not expecting a giant talking spider.  Now I'm intrigued.
I’m confused. Andy Weir has a solo astronaut and spider alien in Project Hail Mary, which is apparently being adapted into a movie soon. Weird coincidence?
No Golf on the Moon?
An austraunaut starting to lose his mind
okay but....... WHY A SPIDER!
Heck to the yes. ❤
"and the oscar goes to "  i can already SEE IIIITTTTTT
Who else got serious "Project Hail Mary" vibes from that trailer?
Remember me a LOVE AND ROBOTS Episode!
this gives me some crazy Love Death and Robots vibes
Shut up and take my Arachnophobia
Adam Sandler can be a really good actor when he is not doing the his usual dumb comedy stuff.
This immediately reminded me of that one Love, Death, and Robots episode...
2:10 I thought it’s the sound of Harry Potter 😅
Non Czechoslowakian actors huh?
Nice plot.
Out of all bugs animals monsters aliens, did it have to be a friggen spider!? Lol I can’t watch fml
If this is as good as it looks...  30 years ago who could have guessed that Adam Sandler of all people would be one of the greatest stars of our era...?
Any one know the music at the 1:04 mark ?
This looks dumb af
I hope this is good but 99% of Netflix movies with decent trailers are absolutely dogshit so we will see
Wife being angry she married a Astronaut without considering that he would do astronaut things is a tired trope and I'm tired of seeing it.
Honestly can’t tell if this will be really good or really bad? 🤷🏻‍♂️
bro wtf why'd it have to be a spider?!
Paul Danos voice is so soothing
Uncut Gems was legendary, this looks. Stellar?
Maybe.
Looks awesome but a spider 🕷️?
I want a therapy creature
Reminds me of love death and robots
The sad thing about these Netflix movies is that they are not available in bluray.
out of any alien form, I hate that its a spider, but I'll watch it
im trying not to laugh
Its always a treat to see, Adam Sandler, do something dramatic.  Instead of one of his unfunny comedies
Future 2024 2025 time travel
They had to make it a creepy ass spider and not one like Lucas? Why?
The spider alien looks ridiculous
This movie will fail. Because Sandler has never ever, and is not a strong enough actor to carry a movie alone. Adam always needs his friend or a big time actor to play of to make a movie successfull.
Why’d it have to be a spider😭
If aliens turn out to be talking spiders, I'm out.
Really… a giant spider… so played out. Yet another boring emotional movie that ends just like all the rest. These streaming studios have gotten to complacent. How is it that black mirror manages to explore new realms of story telling telling in less then an hour (multiple times a season) yet these larger budget stores are far less interesting and have such dull character progression.
I was just telling my wife that I bet the next Adam Sandler movie is going to be about him in space talking to a giant spider therapist
This is going to be epic just saying
I guess it's deliberate that that thing looks as frightening as it does even though it wishes to be friends. I myself am a total arachnophobe, so I'd definitely choose loneliness over that guy lol
stealing from project hail mary?
Kinda reminds me of Donnie Darko.
Another shroom movie.
I'm still dumbfounded by Adam Sandler playing Czech cosmonaut. Finally another representation 😂
Joe Rogan is going to freak out
Gotta take some dr - gs before I watch that one.
Seems like hes got enough money now he get do any movies he wants.
idk i cant get behind movies like this, just dont do anything for me
1:31 how on earth did they make a spider look this sincere??
Makes me think of children of time  novel cause of the spider.
Yeah saw it already when it was called Interstellar
Is it like Solaris?
I love him as A MAN “ HIS CHARACTER “
This trailer gave me goosebumps. I love that Adam Sandler is stepping out of his own shadow and doing more dramatic roles, and I love the originality behind this story. Can’t wait to see this
the creature reminds me of one of andy weir's novels project hail mary
an Adam Sandler trippy space movie🤘😮🍿
Wow first thing on my mind that the spider is "Greta" from Love, Death & Robots in netflix series that greta is an actual alien spider!
Space spider!  NOPE!
Is this Adam Sandler's Eternal sunshine of a spotless mind?
eh.
Damn Sandman is killing it
Something something aragog shelob. Love death and robots. You know the one.  But seriously, this looks like exactly the kind of movie I love. I really hope, that this will be a good one.
Never seen this B4 of him ....this going to be a banger
I'm wondering if the form of the spider is it's true form or if spiders are something sandlers character is just seeing as a manifestation?  When the spider crawls out from around the corner it does say "don't be frightened" so maybe the spider is the "aliens" or explorers true form?
No need for a trailer. It's Adam Sandler in space. I will watch.
After watching "Into the Aquila Rift" I don't trust Netflix and spiders in space.... nope...😅
Yay. Another quirky Adam Sandler movie where its impossible to suspend disbelief because you cant tell if hes trying to be funny, or if the movie is just weird and artsy naturally.
Another tiny hat production. gross
Is Adam Sandler going throug a renaissance??
Gonna need a whoooooole lotta mushrooms for this one!
Did it have to look like a spider??? Cmon...
I hate adam sandler, but love space movie 🤷🏻‍♂️
Has Sandler finally made a movie that's actually worth watching. I wonder.
A cosmic, psychic spider is literally the creature from IT...
from billy madison till now, you are still one of my favorite actors.
Wilsooooooon!!!!!
Looks good! Finally a movie to get excited for. Please don't be woke.
This looks very interesting and will make for a good watch I think! With that being said, it is mighty cold in outer space tonight...
From the trailer I think this movie could be great and finally land the sandman with some big accolades. He looks great and I think this will be awesome
Which American can tell me whats the flag in the thumbnail ? 😅
"he is helped by a mysterious creature" WHY A SPIDER
I wan't to see this movie. But I just think it's weird that out of all the types of creatures they could come up with in a space setting the writer goes with a spider. Again still want to see this movie just find it odd that they go with spider.
This could easily go south.   Like, it's almost threatening that it's a horror movie, but just staying on the other side of that line.  looks good,
Hugely disappointed in the title.... SpaceSpider would have been more appropriate.
And they had to make the spider look very creepy. At least it has a soothing voice.
I wanna watch this but that spider is going to give me nightmares 😂
I smell an Oscar for best actor
Traveller-Entity!?! 🤔🤔🤔 If you know, you KNOW!
Ill die on the spot if I see that giant spider in front of me
2 WORDS: MOON RIPOFF.
Saw a space movie with a spider creature. Got excited thinking it was based on Project Hail Mary.
This basically the episode from Love Death Robots called Beyond the Aquila Rift on Season 1. I don't want to spoil it for you of you watch it but it's Rated R shit so no kids watching haha.
Why did it have to be a giant spider?
Children of Time vibes
I'm probably the only one who can't watch Sandlers new movies. Dont know why. Love his older movies but the new roles are ehh
The story is sooo flat and unrealistic , it’s a shame to waste Adam’s talent on that !
very vauge
He needs to have more intimate relationship with that thing. You know what I mean.
Classic Sandler
of all these emotional training to fly alone?
This reminds me of an episode of Love Death and Robots
wow! 😱
I hope this will be the next interstellar
Rocky??? is that you???
Out of all the creatures in the Universe, they chose one that looks like a spider??☹
if you've seen Reign over me, you know the Sandman's got the Oscar nomination in the bag. He is capable of it.
Does anyone have access to the song in the trailer? I know it's Moonlight Sonata but this version is so good
I hope Andy Weir sues the F outta Netflix.
Looks interesting but did they really need to pick the space spider? lmao
After Uncut Gems, Hustle, and now Spaceman, the Sandlerssance is real
Ok so first of all I HATE spiders…
the best decision Adam Sandler could have make is to stay away from comedy flicks, I hope this is as good as Uncut Gems, he's a great actour
In space: *Farts*
I love Adam Sandler. I think he has nailed his part. I am not sure about the gaint spirder thing, but I still would like to see this. ❤
why does the alien have to be a spider??
This looks incredible
Space spiders?
Wow that movies look so good ! I love Adam Sandler it's gonna be interesting to see him in a serious movie for once, and a friendly alien on top of that ? Sign me up ! Even if it's a spider... lol. I like to see more and more movies with friendly aliens and not always malevolent aliens that want to destroy us, enslave us or harm us. I must admit though that I don't understand people that have difficulties with being alone. I love being alone personally. But I would welcome a friendly alien with me anytime !
Me and giant spiders..... NOPE!
OK. When I saw the spider I thought it looked awful but then I remembered the Sandman has delivered on some pretty epic dramas before so give it a shot.
Not sure this would be good movie.  The trailer doesn’t impress me.
Adam Sandler is underrated in drama roles. He knocked it out of the park with uncut gems like Jim Carry did in the Truman Show. The funniest people on the planet live in the darkest corners. I'm excited to see Sandler in a serious role again. I'm happy for him.
муть какая-то
Is it just me or am I hearing a rendition of moon light sonata?
weird. I guess Czech and EU is paying for the movie?
You show to much.
I was excited, but you lost me at the giant spider…I can’t do it 😖
either adam will gonna get intimate with the alien or the alien will make adam go home using interstellar "stupidity" 😋
Another "look, Sandler can act!" movie. Pass.
aNOTHER SIFI MOVIE WHERE the crew rejects all the premises of the movie:  IM GOING ALONE.    aT LEASE IS NOT THE ANNOYING CREW THAT START Panicking, or blaming each other like stupid human beings, WHILE being SCIENTIST OF high caliber in which hands depend the whole human race LOL
I loved the book that this is based on (Spaceman of Bohemia), I hope they do it justice and not bungle it.
Felt like maybe an eastern European accent would've added a secure dimension to his character but it could still work
Watching Adam Sandler movies growing up, seeing him do these roles almost feels assuring. Like he’s growing up with you.
This looks good! Reminds me of a smaller scale Interstellar or 2001...An astronaut on a mission to explore the far reaches of space, is taken on a unexpected metaphysical journey.
Everything is beautiful....till my irrational fear of spider comes up when the giant tarantula came.
Crack open the edibles!
Rated R for Language? What, does the itsy bitsy spider have a potty mouth? 🤣🤣🤣
For just a second I envisioned Sandler propelling himself through zero G with flatulence.....then suddenly it seems to be a serious film.
Went Nope as soon as I saw the spider  😂
As someone from Czechia (of which Bohemia is just a part and not a whole country) I cant wait to see this.
If you watch any of the tv series Alone then you know that people do start breaking down just from isolation. It’s like the persons brain can’t help but work through baggage and the contestants with clear consciences do much better.
I know that feeling, 9 months straight in Iraq.
Looks good. Kove adam sandler
First Leo, Now This!? Is Adam Sandler BACK?
i really thought this was gona be a comedy.....than i saw "director of chernobyl" and now im depress
This is what YouTube calls 1080p Premium? this was a blurry mess of digital artifacts. Step aside VP9 and H.265, YouTube is bringing back Real Player!!
Looks like something that you’d drop some acid to and go on a journey
Life of Pi
If a giant #%#%ing spider suddenly appeared inside my spaceship I can guarantee you the reaction would not be this blase'.
Czechia🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿
"don't be afraid" -Giant terrifying space spider
Paul Dano as the space spider: "speak to him, say it louder" Adam Sandler: "I ABANDONED MY CHILD!!!!"
Sandler. Way to go buddy!
JESUS CHRIST, I can't, I think this is the first time adam sandler will actually give me nightmares.😨😨😨😨😨😱😱😱😱😱😱, He should have just made another zohan film
This looks good, like REALLY good.
Me encanta que trate de hacer personajes muy fuera de su zona de confort y todo lo que es del espacio me gusta. Slds desde Panamá
Why tarantula? I would be scared if Im alone in a spaceship with giantic tarantula IoI
Isabella Rossellini, so lovely..I remember the blue velvet
Dobrá haluz, tvl 🤪
All the CGi in this movie, they can’t fix his old man’s face he has more wrinkles than my balls
This feels good.
Reminds me of Beyond the Aquila Rift by Alistair Reynolds. Looks awesome.
Ummmmmm sure ok
Compelled, watch it because of Adam Sandler and not watch it because of giant spider trying to be Jiminy cricket
Seems like kind of a ripoff of Project hail mary?
Welp. They deleted it again
Comedians are some of the best dramatic actors because their level of commitment to a joke much like a scene is so strong! Robin Williams 🥹 God rest his soul was an amazing actor perfect example! One hour photo, Insomnia, What Dreams May Come! C’mon 🤲🏾
but how did he pass the psych evaluation for astronauts? they don't send up people who get homesick after 6 months.
..grabs a few cans of raid...
"Do not be afraid" NAH BRO WTF
Seems like a full movie of the Love, Death, Robots episode "Beyond the Aquila Rift" looks interesting
Hell to the no someone give me a rocket launcher I don’t trust the spider .
This looks ridiculous and I don’t mean in a good way.
Came expecting an "alien". Left having seen a spider 😂
I can’t watch this movie because I have arachnophobia 😨
Well that's......not what I was expecting. Never thought I'd see a movie about life as a depressed Australian, our giant therapy Tarantula's have been a god send.
I just hope the big spider is not an empahwhered wahman fighting the aracnid partiarchy. Let's make a bet. If the movie is any good I will not cut my Netflix membership. Anyone deserves a 674th chance, some said.
So excited to see Sandler in another serious role
I thought this might be from book “project Hail Mary”. Great book
Why a spider..........
Uhm. 😕 I don’t care how “friendly” it is. If I saw a giant spider on a spaceship, alone with me, in the middle of the galaxy. I’d burn it down lol.
Only thing that’s shit about this so far is the design of the alien. It just looks like a spider. If I was a floating orb or a mist cloud that would be better imo
Nup, not for me. I can never take Adam seriously. I'm guessing the spider represents his subconscious and this film is all to do with how one copes when suffering severe loneliness.
But why does it have to be spider….
Wait is this a comedy?
Man why are they making Adam Sandler act now after all these years
Man that spider is freaking freaky (boom)
Looks interesting but I hate Spiders!
this looks good Adam Sandler
..... oh,  So NOT a funny one.  Nah but for real this looks awesome
If Rob Schneider was in this it would turn into Station 69
ADAM SANDLER YEAAHHHHHH!!!!!
If I were him: A talking flea? oh heck, I'm totally loosing it!
What if you're a fan of Adam Sandler but have Arachnophobia?
New Adam Sandler YESSS!!!!! 💖💖💖💖
Paul Dano as the spider is pretty intense.
Has a bit of Children of time with the big Jumping spider.
Ya'll swear Adam hasn't been showing his acting skills for years. Even his comedies had non comedic presence that shows that he can do more than just make people laugh but cry and feel all kinds of other things. Bro has no comfort zones, bro has BEEN showing his range ya'll just don't pay enough attention to details.
looks like adam sandler has had enough of the beach resorts with rob schneider he decided to go to space and find befriend a space tarantula now
2 HOURS OF HIM AND HIS HALLUCINATED SPIDER HAVING A THERAPY SESSION.... 🤔 HARD PASS 😂
is he gonna bang the spider
In all honesty, as soon as I saw “….Chernobyl” I was in; anything affiliated with that show is amazing…
Spider therapist… in spaice… smh
So meta
when aragog is out of the box
I'm watching this for the spider🕷
Interstellar better!
ehhh idk if I can see Adam doing a serious role. We will see though.
I was so enthralled with the trailer until the tarantula appeared. Ngl, I freaked out. 😬 I’m extremely scared of spiders. It’ll be tough watching this.. or maybe I’ll just pass.(sorry)  Happy to see my boy Adam S. Getting more love from Netflix. 🥰
Director of Chernobyl teaming up with Adam Sandler?? That's literally all I needed to hear
well eff my Arachnophobia
Is this a sequel to spaceship 69
A trashy movie
What a cute 🕷️ 😘
Who does Kevin James play?
i love adam sandler since i was young , but i dont have trust is in this , hoppefully im wrong and he will grow out of this
Adam friggin' Sandler?  Can he do serious drama?  But Carey Mulligan can do no wrong, so I'll probably watch this one once I can see it for free.
FECK YEAH!  I saw a trailer for ISS - where astronauts are fighting in space.  It made me throw up in my mouth.  THIS movie looks like real Sci-Fi, intelligent and intriguing.
Sandler starred in uncut gems.  Love he isn't focused on goofy comedy only.
I wish Paul Dano was my sleep paralysis demon spider too
Thank you so much for making a trailer that does not show the whole movie or how it ends.
Ok this got my attention. Bsic premise reminds me about latest Andy Weir novel which was actually so bad and predictable it wasn't worth the time or money. Movie seems to be going in more interesting direction.  Fingers crossed its good!
When Adam Sandler gets cast in a dramatic serious film he knocks it out of the park, then he goes back to his regular dumb (yet very succesful) comedies. This looks very interesting.
Imagine Sandler acting getting better with age
Forget trophies...You've had our love & admiration always Sandman.
Interesting premise. I hope they do it justice.
Something interesting and well made, from Netflix? A rare sight.
lost me with spider alien
Comedians literally make the best actors in serious drama films
Why it couldn’t haven been a octopus.
Great actor! Netflix did a good deal !
That looked terrible, wow.
Looks good but why a spider dear god
YOU SHOULD EAT HARRY,
Is the alien spider real. Is it fake? Tune in to find out!
This legit looks interesting and refreshing to see Adam in something more serious and profound.
I hope this doesn't have a vague indie storyline with an even more vaguely weird ending
Almost Project Hail Marry adjacent.
Adam Sandler kind of blows, people got to grow up and let Happy gilmore go.
I know Adam Sandler's vacations are a bit of a meme now, but he gets mad kudos for taking an outer space vacation.
spoieler                         in the end he was lost in the space. The spider ( he is an alien) helps him to a nice death with hallucinations without making him suffer .
Lol, Adam Sandler being an astronaut is the least believable thing.
Adam Sandler is WORST CHOICE! He is realy bad actor!
space, wack
I love how Adam Sandler, after years of making low brow comedies to set him and his friends for life, started to show others his actual acting skill
Charlotte’s Web in Space 🕷️🔭🪐🛸👽🚀🧑‍🚀
if it was ANYTHING but a giant spider I'd love to watch...I just don't know that I can
He can act but I wish he would stop trying to win an Oscar, it's not worth it and they'll never give it to him.
I think every so often Adam Sandler has to do a good movie just to prove he can. I guess grown ups 37 is next up.
What the heck! This is a movie that looks so nuts that it s intriguing. Will give it a watch.
Love, death & robots - Beyond the Aquila Rift?
I really was hoping for something else.  Why did Netflix waste its money on this movie.  Please don't call it Science Fiction, its more like some kind of weird chick flick about a skanky wife.
Jeez dude stop making movies
Project Hail Mary vibes !
They stole this exact plotline from Death love Robots Aqua rift or reef forget witch one.  Boils down to an isolated spaceman on the verge of insanitiy/depression death due to isolation and is encountered by a spider like alien with the power to keep him in a coma or matrix where he is happy with a wife.  I guess it shows how good that show really is.
Lol it's a sign it's happening. Prepare yourselves..they trying to tell us something
dont tell me he fucks that spider man
If that alien turns out to be trying to take over the earth I called its basically in the trailer when Adam Sandler character said I'm not allowing that
I hate how he only gets accolades for his serious roles. Comedy is not hard to do and if you watch just go with it there are amazing nuances he does with his eyes. I've always been a fan of his art
Thought it might have been a Project Hail Mary movie
Welp!! I won't be watching this movie. I hope this is his worst rated and received movie ever! I love Adam Sandler and have seen all of his films but due to my severe case of arachnophobia!!! Cannot watch this one. Thanks for giving me nightmares Adam!
Love the Sandman, day one watch.
In the end, it will all have been in his mind because he went crazy in space. The end.
I was already in but a talking spider definitely helps. Cant wait to venture into space in March.
i once had depression/anxiety attacks that manifested as delusions/hallucinations of friendly giant spiders much like this one, they never interacted with me, nor seemed menacing at all, they were just there watching me go about my life. zoloft levelled me out and the spiders never returned. apparently it is quite common
Nope. Never trust an alien. It’s about to go down
Carey Mulligan is almost 40, she's pretty far past the having kids stage.
I love it when he takes on a serious role. I wish he would have done more of them. He's actually a pretty good actor.
Adam! Let's go this gave me goosebumps I'm stoked 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Looks boring
Six months in isolation? Amateur.
Nope. Looks boring and the Alien looks like a spider.
Reminds me of a book i read in highschool from the 60s or something about an astronauts reality slipping on a long mission. I wanna say it had a cosmic type name but either way, this looks kind of intriguing yet super emotional and surrealistic. Might be one of those 3 hour cosmic acid trip tropes and it ends with finding out their was a gas leak on-board and he hasnt left the launch pad yet and was just tripping his balls off 😶
ummmmmmm.....this looks like Project Hail Mary🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔. Great book btw by Andy Weir!!!
Looks good that.
Does anyone else think this is ripoff of Project Hail Mary?
Anybody knows the song?
Anyone knows what is this Moonlight Sonata remix?
I bet he loses his mind from month 4 and this shit is just an illusion until he eventually opens his suit while outside the ship in space...
Reminds me of that love death and robots episode Beyond the Aquila rift! Does the spider save or destroy.
Stick to comedy, That's what people want to see!!!
A science fiction drama starring Adam Sandler being directed by the person that brought us Chernobyl? This is a strange timeline we're on.
Is he trying to find Thanos?
Sound?
10% Rotten Tomato score.
WHELP!...... I was very intrigued and interested until the part of the telepathy spider!!!!!!!!!  UGH!  And I love Adam Sandler - but won't be watching this one.   🙄🙄😕😕
Adam Sandler was incredible in Punch Drunk Love so I'm very excited to see this.
Plot twist: It's not an alien, the spaceship was built in Australia
Lame
Hey! White guys ARE NOT ALLOWED to have white wives in movies! What youre doing is ILLEGAL! That lady has to be black or a dude
This looks beautiful
Boring...
damn, Caddicarus is an actor now?
01:30 I'm torn between being creeped out and touched. Paul Dano as a talking spider in outer space makes sense though.
Oooooh this looks amazing! All of this, right up my alley.
Looks great!
“Wylan summoned every bit of brvado he’d learned from Nina, the will he’d learned from Matthias, the focus he’d studied in Kaz, the courage he’d learned from Inej, and the wild, reckless hope he’d learned from Jesper, the belief that no matter the odds, somehow they would win” - Crooked Kingdom
Space spider?   Hmmm….no thanks!
looks like the people who made this read project hail mary.
Paul Dano space spider for the win wahoo he’s just like me fr
This… looks….. incredible!!!! I can not wait for this one. What a cool concept!
Looks like a great movie. I love serious Adam Sandler roles. Although I do think they may have potentially taken some ideas from Andy Weirs (author of the The Martian) book "Project Hail Mary". Which is an incredible book of a similar premise of a man in space who meets an alien not unlike this one. Overall story lines are different but can't help but acknowledge how strangely similar aspects of this film are.
last serious movie we saw of adam was uncut gems and that was a 10/10 performance, im exited
AS is so good in drama...Reign On Me was so great too
As a father who's away from his wife and child I resonate with this movie and will surely watch it.
This seems to be heavily inspired by Beyond the Aquila Rift.
Someone cooked here
I go where this movie goes, right, Spaceman?
From Myislamicdream:  Tarantula (Hairy spider; Spider) A tarantula in a dream represents a loathsome and an evil woman who interferes with people's business and damages their interests, or who destroys what they repair and denies having anything to do with their sufferings. In a dream, this interpretation is based on the legendary nervous disease, formerly believed to be caused by a poisonous bite of a tarantula. Thus, when this harmless hairy spider is seen in a dream, it also could represent a lethal enemy of a fierce sting, scowling, or a despising look. (Also see Spider) Dream Interpreter: Ibn Sirin
Sandler is great in dramatic performances.  If this movie is about a REAL alien interacting with him it could be amazing!  If it's about his mind playing tricks on him then I'm not that interested.  I've seen that gimmick a hundred times and am not overly interested in it.
Spoiler: the spider is his just imagination to cope with his loneliness.
Is this a Netflix version of Ijon Tichy space travels?
recognized PAUL DANO's voice IMMEDIATELY!!!,......this looks very original,..........the last coupl'a years, it feels like we're getting back to original content in the cinemas'!!!!!
Getting some Beyond The Aquila Rift vibes
I love when Sandler takes on more serious roles. I’m so down.
Station 69
I hope Sandler stay in outer space and never come back
That giant spider better not eat him!
Adam Sandler, Carey Mulligan and Paul Dano. Count me in!
This reminds me of the Children of Time book series.
I love when a comedian shows his serious acting chops.  You get to see some amazing work.  I hope this is right up there.
Why a spider alien tho
Some weird interpretation of Stanislav Lem's "Solaris"
Spider is actually real, that's the twist.
Andy Weir's novel Project Hail Mary is slated to be a movie starring Ryan Gosling. It's about a spaceman on a mission who ends up being helped by a spider like alien. Looking forward to that one too.
Really looking forward to this. Adam Sandler really is a very good actor. Can’t wait.
Looks trash
Studies show, the more intelligent a person is, the sooner they will slip into the mental state they portray in this movie.
Adam Sandler is in a weird stage in his career
Can anyone tell me the name of the music or piece being played. I have heard it in many places but can't recollect what it is.
Can’t wait!! Is it all in his head, though??
I hope this is good
Is this in Adrian Tchaikovsky's "Children of Time" universe? :)
The issue I have is that I've seen Love, Death and Robots "Beyond the Aquila Rift", and as gentle as this critter acts, it's probably all an illusion to keep the Spaceman from dying too quickly.
Wtf ! Why did they choose a tarantula, I can't watch it ... Nevermind, I don't have Netflix  🤓
Don't be fooled by this, guys. Adam Sandler still shot this all inside of the spaceship in Hawaii.
WHY SPIDERS!!!!  I CANT! IT FREAKS ME OUT!!
I've got an idea for a movie. -Go on. It's about a russian cosmonaut working with a spider. -Oh a spider, is this a tense psycoloical thriller about the KGB spies in the soviet space prog.. No it's a literal giant alien spider. They're in space. -Giant Alien Spiders in Space are tight. Yes they are Sir. -So we have a sci-fi horror, action spectacular with a Russian twist! -No Sir, the Giant Alien Spider is going to coach the hero through his grief and unresolved emotional baggage. -It's ET? It's ET!
Why is there a giant spider
A space movie that's deep, I'm in! I love how these popular A list actors doing good space movies recently...Brad Pitt, Mat Damon, Tom Cruise, etc...and now Adam Sandler.
PLEASE I NEED THIS SONG
Boring... I thought this was going to be a movie with sandman and rob snider as Uri.
Reminds me a bit of Project Hail Mary
More woke BS. Space isn’t real
Ok but why does it have to be a giant spider?…
Holy hell thanks god they don't even try to speak czech 😂
okay adam i see you
Why do they make ambitious visual movies like this that are only available on Netflix? I'd love to see this in a theater.
“Who does Kevin James play?”
Adam Sandler is without question the most overrated actor of all time.
Giving off The Little Prince vibes...nice.
Noice!
This looks ridiculous, dude stick to comedy.
Did it have to be a spider?
Naka philippine flag sya oh❤️
This seems weird. And we should celebrate weird.
The Man, The Myth, The Legend, The GOAT, The SANDMAN!!
Adam Sandlers role in switch was the first movie I ever cried while watching.. Sandler knows how to hit you in the feelings for sure.
Sandler's is so much better in dramas then comedies
Adam Sandler and his emotional support spider.
This actually looks intriguing.
Not at all what I was expecting and actually looks intriguing.
This is my headcanon:  I am absolutely convinced that Adam Sandler is the one man that really figured out life.  He realized it takes minimum effort to amass huge piles of money doing horrible "comedies", so he does exactly that to get in with the cool kids in Hollywood. Once there, he can choose absolutely any role he wants, when he really wants it, and prove all the naysayers that he is an incredible actor.  Bear in mind, he's worked with some really great directors and writers out there. Paul Thomas Anderson, Noah Baumbach, the Zafdie Brothers, and now Johan Renck, they all had Sandler in drama form. And in all of the times Sandler has done dramatic roles, he's really knocked it out of the park.  But never often enough that we get bored of it. He knows his comedies don't transcend, and they are not memorable. That's not their point. But I bet he knows his drama roles keep blowing people away, so he does them, to prove the artist he really is, and to reap the absolute delight of knowing everyone never expects the depths he can bring to bear when truly acting.  I mean, his dramatic roles are so infrequent, that whenever we see him doing one, everyone loses their minds. And they all go to position themselves as incredible performances.  I've got nothing but respect for that man.
Why do they always send these people with Wife and young or new born children for these Space Missions ?  Just send some Forever Alone dude, it's not like there isn't that many out there lol
This low key looks like its going to be a master piece
Looks good. Although there's a lot of similarities to an upcoming movie starring Ryan Gosling called Project Hail Mary, based on an Andy Weir novel. Great book by the way, if anyone is bored of doom scrolling
Huge spider means I’m out 😩😅
I like it when Adam Sandler goes and does a real movie.
Looks boring af like ad astra
huge talking space spider in 0 gravity and in closed quarters is pretty much all my nightmares combined.
This is oscar material, c'mon academy give him a chance, he deserve it!
Took me half the trailer to recognize Adam Sandler.
This does look pretty darn good... I want to watch it.
I loved him in Reign Over Me and Uncut Jewels.   It just shows that the Sandman has quite the amount of range.   To this day, I can't think of Reign Over Me without feeling a bit choked up.   It shook me up so badly, that I can never watch it again.
What is it with these actors that are famous for goofy movies having these amazing drama chops? Jim Carrey, Robin Williams, Adam Sandler???
Adam Sandler playing Czech astronaut from the future in a Netflix movie. I never imagined that, am I having a fever dream? XD As a Czech I hope its a good movie Chernobyl was good so at least the direction should be good.
Farewell Aragog
Yes! Dramatic Adam Sandler is the best Adam Sandler.
i feel like Adam Sandler is spiralling into depression his last two Netflix movies seem really depressing.
I saw the spider crawl around the corner and made me think of the alien in Project Hail Mary by Andy Wier.
space spider
Adam Sandler’s High Life? Adam Sandler’s Ad Astra? 😂😂😂
Go back and make comedy pls. Thanks
Project Hail Mary with juuuuusssst the right changes to make it a drama…..
I hope this is not Adam Sandler's Ad Astra moment.
_This is some Interstellar " sister " movie, and I am 100% waiting for March 1st..._
I hate Sandler but this looks amazing.
They say that Adam Sandler makes movies as an excuse to go on vacation at filmed locations, and this time, it's out of this world.
alternative title:  "Pennywise in Space"
For a moment there I thought Netflix really screwed up the film adaptation of Project Hail Mary
Should have called this "Closer To Chris" ❤
Sorry, I see an enormous spacious ship and wonder, why are they sending the person alone, with all the troubles and risk this entails, when they could fit half a dozen people in there.
"Adam Sandler is like on a space ship, and he's got a giant talking spider as his best friend co pilot, and like, he learns to forgive his ex wife who is like a medieval princess or something."
Sandler in it. And composed by Richter whose music for "The Leftovers" still plays in my head? Definitely yes!
People who just went to the trending and clicked 1 on trending👇
Love Death Robot Vibes here.
Pitch: Adam Sandler is in space and befriends a giant talking space spider.
Is this the 'once a decade awesome performance between shit movies' that Sandler is so good at?
At first I thought it was some kind of adaption/reworking of Project Hail Mary.
They are saying this is one of his best comedies in years.
He really looks so defeated in this trailer. Glad he's taking a step into a few more serious roles. It's refreshing.
Looks boring
DUMB!!!!
i spent 13 years in solitary confinement 6 months 6??? hahah - such weak willed people americans
Envisioning an SCP Foundation Series or Film: Excited about the idea of a big production company creating an SCP series or film. The captivating lore is ready to go, and much of it is copyright-free. Any thoughts on this potential project's success?
Yess Yess Yess.
bojkot adam and zionists
Jazz hands happyhappyhappy
It´s not in Czech? What kind of adaptation is that? Come on Adam.
We are all going to watch the Sandman win an Oscar for Best Actor. I'm convinced it is inevitable at this point.
I thought this one of his comedies so I was gonna skip it seeing how I out grew his comedy. But this looks interesting! I think he does good outside of comedy
Da goat idc
Imagine if the spider was the serpent
He needs some space Raid 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Adam Sandler does space therapy with an adorable giant spider. Yes please.
I was hoping the spider would have a proper "Sandler Voice"
Hope this is better then the last one he did with his daughters
Punch-drunk love Sandler mode. Love it
Why is everyone the non-inclusive race, sex, gender, and weight?  I’m going to have to dock you 3milliom DEI ESG points.   I hope the one about overweight, fat, black, transgender polar bears of color is more inclusive.
I'll watch it because I love Adam Sandler, but damn do I wish they chose another form for the alien.
uncut gems and hustle   were 2 of my favourite movies of the last 5 years,  cant say this looks great but many many trailers have fooled me before
So, 57 year old Adam Sandler is an astronaut and he's missing his wife, 38 year old Carey Mulligan...'k.🤨
You can do it!
When Adam Sandler isn't making films that might be scams sometimes he actually puts out interesting stuff.  A lot of stuff he's done with Netflix has been surprisingly interesting. I dont think he'd have made a lot of these movies for a studio. A lot of them (not all, especially at first- a lot were typical raunchy dumb comedies) are surprisingly cerebral. I've actually enjoyed a lot of his Netflix movies.
lame
I see adam sandler im in mdfkr
I prefer the original title... "Along Came A Space Spider."
comedians make some of the best dramas - they just need a good story
Czech interstellar:
The waterboy goes to space...
they just had to make it a spider
Whats the trailer song called?
why did it have to be a fking spider. god damnit!!!! i want to watch this but im not sure i will be able to
The sentient, helpful spider immediately reminded me of those from Children of Time (which is an excellent read btw)
Nobody wants to say it, but we all expect a sex scene with the spider. Right?
Looks intriguing….. But why a giant spider?!?!
in movies, they always send up mentally unstable astronauts
An astronaut losing his mind and hallucinating due to isolation. Very similar to the 2009 movie “Moon” starring Sam Rockwell.
Aragog is that you?
Never thought I would see Adam Sandler playing a role of a czech astronaut in my life. But here it is
Czechia mentioned!!! RRRAAAHHH!!!
You can't do comedy any more that is why he is doing different movies
That js creepy
Ummm I was NOT expecting this trailer lolol
I'll wait for Project Hail Mary. Better story, better book, hopefully better movie.
Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherfuckin spiders on this motherfuckin ship.
...what?
and out of nowhere rob schneider appears and says "CUT HIS FREAKIN HEAD OFF!"
Can we like i don’t know, swap the spider for a penguin?   “Is that it daddy, did the penguin make you do it?”
Good job nexflix
Why does something about this premise seem so familiar? Space spider's and all...
Can’t wait
so is he seeing things or is this an alien?
this looks/feels a lot like that 'Beyond the Aquila Rift' short story that was in Love & Death + Robots
This looks promising. Sandler has a pretty great track record for his more dramatic roles.
Bold to make it a talking spider. Google says 2-6 percent of the population has arachnaphobia. But I guess since there's no box office it doesn't really matter.
adam sandler sometimes likes to go out and hunt awards
Esto no se ve nada mal
Ok, this is really cool, but i hope that theres also a czech audio to go with it. Because if not, then it just doesnt make sense for this to be about czech people anyway, because it wont give it that vibe.
I hadn't realized until this trailer how much Paul Dano sounds like Harold from Twin Peaks.
A huge spider? NOPE!
Reminds me Project Hail Mary
Oh my, the alien is a sentient spider with telepathic abilities.
What
If theres something i didnt expect in this lifetime then it is Adam Sandler playing a Czech cosmonaut thats talking to a giant spider to try and save his marriage......And the thing i didnt expect the most? That its a CZECH cosmonaut lmao. But im glad everytime my country is mentioned somewhere
I'm glad to see Shelob finally being appreciated as a fulfilled actor and being cast in another major movie and not just as a villain on the Lord Of The Rings.
The movie reminds me of "Love, Death & Robots" Beyond the Aquila Rift", such a good story, if it's half as interesting, this will be good <3
Reminds me of project Hail Mary
They should consider Adam Sandler for an episode of Black Mirror
Love Adam Sandler. I’m really looking forward to this one!!
Looks good. I hope it's not a musical....
This is gonna be awesome. The Sandman always kills it in dramatic roles.
Script writer watching YouTube vid of guy playing with jumping spider after watching Interstellar has dream where lonely astronaught befriends spider to help cope with loneliness.
So... did the Australians take part in the mission?
Sandler doesn't have the chops for the micro acting required in this flick; he can only carry the ball so far. Full respect for trying, though. Dano and Mulligan, however, are worthy reasons to show up and watch.
That's one terrific pig!
Looks like it's going to be a pretty solid adaptation, absolutely stoked that the novel got picked up.
feels like an backstory of Love,Death, &Robots - "Beyond the Aquila Rift"
great, bow there are juews in space
Man. There are parts so intriguing that should have been left out the trailer, Adam was enough to show all the way up til the “enhanced memory” part. Ddnt ruin the movie for me but I bet it did for a lot of other people
Thanks to 30 Rock for keeping me from pronouncing its title as anything other than 'Spachemmin'
this looks really funny, can't wait 🤣🤣
I think the alien is not real and everything is all in his mind.....no way an uber spider is the the best thing they could have come up with for an Alien from the beginning of time....really a spider......we can do better than that.
Shoulda been made this movie! Finally one i can probably watch and enjoy!!
Since Uncut Gems, every time I see Sandler I get excited. I never would have thought it possible.
A movie made almost entirely of flashbacks. HELL NO
I can’t wait for this masterpiece 🔥
Music Composed by legendary MAX RICHTER!
Alien spider has be part of his imagination how will he not know it’s there whole time in space ship unless earth spider mutated from space radiation
bs
Project Fail Mary
Why did it have to be a spider 😭
Isabelle Rossalini ! i love her !
Giant Spider??? NO THANKS!
Adam Sandler, imo, is an amazing dramatic actor. I love watching him play serious roles - my favourite being PUNCH DRUNK LOVE.
So the screenwriter read Project Hail Mary then?
This reminds anyone else of Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir? A lot of similarities.
finally a new good looking sci fi mysterylike movie
Loneliness: New character unlocked
What thee actual 🤣 It's an adaptation of a czech novel called "Spaceman from Czechia"
Where is the Major Tom song when we need it? This looks amazing.
WOW!!! THIS LOOKS SUPER INTERESTING!
If I had to make a prediction for this movie, you think the spider alien is a manifestation of him going insane, but I'm going to say the twist is the spider alien is real and wants to get to Earth or find out where it is for evil reasons
So click in space?
Emotional support Spider. Nice.
This looks amazing. Adam Sandler is a briliant actor. Just keep him away from the keyboard. A  "Adam Sandler" film is a sloppy piece of work written by Sandler while he's half asleep and planning for where to shoot the film so that he can plan his family vacation. A film that happens to have Adam Sandler in it, will be written and directed by people with vision and a story they want to tell.
Does this look like someone read Project Hail Mary before writing this or is it just in my head?
Adam. Excuse me, Mr. Sandler. I’ve decided in a unanimous vote conducted by only me that you’re done with comedy. You are a very strong dramatic actor.
He had progressed since his Saturday night live days and one movie he did is punchdrunklove
They really took Andy Weir's novel and ran with it huh?
Adam Sandler in serious roles is never a miss, plus the alien spider thing is such a cool combination I can't wait to see. That trailer hypes me to watch the movie immediately. 😍
1:53 ok 2b you gonna start killing robots too?
More like Adam Sadler.
And i think its gonna be a long long time till touchdown brings me round again to find im not the man they think i am at home oh no no im rocketman ROCKETMAN burning out his fumes here alone.
Adam Sendler playing a Czech astronaut ? take my money and shut up
Glad to see Tony the tarantula is getting work
Dang, another one falling beyond the Aquilla Rift huh?
Oh this is going to demolish me
The choice to have the calm, friendly voice come from a GIGANTIC SPIDER is... new.
Adam Sandler has made some pretty funny comedy in his career but I actually prefer him as a dramatic actor more. He is extremely talented in that discipline.
Sorry can't help but pronounce this like Dr Leo Spaceman on 30 Rock
Use Moonlight Sonata in a trailer, get a like.  I really hope this is good, I love the premise and as 7 hundred people have already said he's underrated as a dramatic actor. This also seems like it could be a bit goofy, which is okay in doses, so we'll have to see.
So basically a non screaming adam sandler movie ...pass😂
i was looking forward to this movie, now im scared cause of the spider
Adam Sandler..Sci Fi..Say no more Netflix im in
I thik the concept of this movie is all about hhis hallucinations due to his loneliness and longingly to see his wife.
This movie just cured my arachnophobia
march 1... c'mon...
Punch-Drunk Love  Uncut Gems  Spaceman   Adam Sandler is killing it!
this looks really depressing...
Telepathic Space Tarantula... Yeah that's a maximum nope for me
This movie will be big for the arachnoid community. Good to see some arachnoid representation!
sounds like they phoned in the soundtrack
No thanks, I pass.
Well… def not watching that.  Looks good tho.
The spider is cute
I really want to watch this, just dont know if i'll be able to make it through with this giant spider thing :(
Nope cant handle Spider's 🕷️🕸️
Sandler is consistently underrated due to people judging him solely on his fun/silly/escapist movies.  In truth, he has some serious talent so I hope he wins a statue at some point - would be nice to cheer him on and see the naysayers choke back their shock and amazement.
depression and depression all movie depression ……. 🙃🙃🙃🙃
Holy crap,  this is like "Children of Time" by Adrian Tchaikovsky.
Boring!! I wanna see Adam play a villain
Aragog is indeed so underrated since HP2 , happy that he's  finaly getting the screentime he deserves!
Sandler's come a long way sin Billy Madison
meh
Damn happy Gilmore lost!!
Even Paul Dano can't cure my arachnophobia, damn Imma pass this one
The spider reminds me of the alien from Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir
Adam Sandler - All jokes aside...
Could this be Adam's Oscar?
massive rip off of Andy Weir's book "Hail Mary"
Seems like 50 last dates lol
Did Eric Cartman, . . . (I mean Awesom-O), . . . . pitch the idea for this movie?
When it started, I got all excited, but then it turns out it's mostly drama about this guy and his wife, not really my thing. Oh, well.
looks quite boring
Big ass mutha fatherin arachnid!
Czechia can into space
Is this one new?
I really want to say this looks interesting, but when you have a giant talking spider....why the hell is the alien a spider, what's the point?
I swear just burn the whole ship down with the damn spider😂😂
Station 69 comes to mind. "I'm floating through the darkness, there's nothing much to see; and a cosmonaut named, Yuri, is the only one with me. Now we're in zero gravity, just spinnin' round and round. The next thing you know I'm right-side up and Yuri's upside down..."
Anything with Paul Dano is a must watch.
Trully dramatic, reminds me "What Dreams May Come" year 1998  by Robin Williams!
Damn
The teaser looked awesome, I was so looking forward to this. And they had to bring in a spider. Why did they had bring in a spider? Arachnophobia sucks....
Moon.
Who let netflix cook??? wtf
Funny how so many idiots were making fun of the first teaser trailer, now they are wetting their pants to see this....😂😂
Why does this actually look good
premise is rediculous, no space agency would allow a person with this kind of connection to his family, take part in a long term solo flight..  low IQ idiocy in movie making is the norm now it seems, good job millennials.
I will watch this on Netflix!
looks great, love adam's dramatic side.
what in the actual
Project Hail Mary rip off?
Is this not a reboot or a sequel?? I may die of surprise.
We love Adam, even his worst comedies are still funny. Looking forward to this new venture of his!
that spider alien reminds me of hail mary book
Adam Sandler as an astronaut who befriends a gieant talking spider... ... ... well, didn't expect that...
I'm Spiderman
Go Adam! Go Judit! Woot!
I know what people say about Adam. But i love hos comdy films and realized that he is actually a great actor when he did "Click" which was sold as a comdy film, but it's actually a sad, distressing story beneath everything. He eas fantastic in Uncut Gems as well.
"This March, Rob Schneider is....a Spider!"
Man, this makes me hopeful that we could one day get a movie adaptation of the _Children of Time_ novel. I'm definitely checking this out.
“🎶Ground Control to Major Tom…🎶”
They just HAD to make it a spider. Now I cant watch this....
This looks kind of interesting but I can't get over how stupid of an idea it is to send someone into space alone for that long. Like no shit they'll go insane. And damn its been 6 months and the wife's already giving up most LDRs can survive longer than that.
Adam just looks bored. that’s not acting
This looks intriguing, truly, but why did it have to be a giant spider?...
Why a spider though? So creepy lol. Also, they should’ve know better than to send someone solo. Humans need other humans to interact with.
Do not be what!?.........
Probably the closest we'll ever get to a 'Children of Time' movie.
Adam Sandler 2.0
Alright. Stakka Boo directing. Awesome.
Clicked on this thinking it was gonna be a shovel fest Sandler one and done paycheck grab, which, maybe it is, but now I'm intrigued.
Paul Dano about to tell him a riddle with that voice
I like the song playing the background, anyone know what it is?
you guys seen Enemy 2013....... the ending scene?
YOOOO
Best actor ever!!!! Thanks Adam.🙏
How can he make Hubbie Halloween and also Uncut gems and this? It makes no sense.
Isabella Rossellini - the voice, her face - how much like her mother, the great Ingrid Bergman!
This Looks Good!
I was so excited for another one of those rare Adam Sandler dramas. Then, I saw the spider...
Whenever an old comedian decides to star in emotional dramas, you have to bet that comedian is considering retirement.
a man goes completely insane in only 6 months?
Adam Sandler, did not recognize him until i saw the name.
Ayo, this shit looks wack, son!
This looks amazing!
I was on board until the giant space spider
Directors are artists but similar mindset viewer will like it because I don't like to see space and brain fried mood sucking film also it's Adam why not a positive story like the Martian could be interesting.everyone watched enough Interstellar one and only masterpiece also space adventure with thriller more fun but not for Adam . Script like the Martian could be interesting...
It's grat they got Winnie the Pooh to voice the spider, he's a big get these days
I was with this until the giant tarantula appeared. I'm out. I still hope it is a great movie, though. Adam Sandler is the best.
This looks phenomenal
It's eternal sunshine with Adam Sandler. Basically.
She literally watching netflix and eating chips with his BF while he's talking to an imaginary spider in space
He really does shine playing this opposite character of his typical  comedy roles
Johan Renck is an underrated genius. The novel is amazing and I'm pretty sure that Sandler is gonna be terrific. Can't wait to see it.
if Matthias Schoenaerts becomes the main character will be another love story 😂
Hard pass.
When I saw the thumbnail I was hoping this would basically be Billy Madison in space. This works too though
At first I thought it looked a lot like Project Hail Mary. Confusing. Idk how I feel about it cause I would rather have a PHM movie.
The movie we  havent asked for but needed .. less goo !!
not interested AT ALL
Somebody played Lifeless Planet. 😊
Although the alien tarantula ('Hanuš') gives me the creeps, I am intrigued by Paul Dano's voiceover characterization.
whatever, youtube, putting this promotion into my feed, with comments that feel as real as the imdb praise for movies that expletive. How do I block these promotions that are not marked as such? PS: the trailer; the moment one realizes this is yet another solitude movie about a fantasy/real companion, because of the possible drama, one hits skip. SKIP.
Drama Adam Sandler is my favorite Adam Sandler next to Waterboy Adam Sandler who is undefeated.
You have my attention
Boring melodrama.
Regardless of how this turns out critically, I love seeing comedians take on serious roles. It's so interesting to me and I don't know why
10 years ago, I wouldn't have believed myself if I uttered the words "I can't believe how good of an actor Adam Sandler has become".
Adam as a dramatic actor is better than him being funny - oh and LOL spiders from Mars as the alien - well played
I remember seeing Spanglish (and I know there are perhaps a couple of other films?) and his ability to be a serious actor but it doesn't seem until more recently that he has been allowed to really do this work and be appreciated by the masses. I hope this does well.
I'm sorry I can't take him seriously lol
What an extremely innovative concept. Never done before!
Damn, ok Adam, I see you. This looks thought provoking.
This is the type of weird shit studios should be making.
He definitely fucks the spider..
I bet he's gonna' do unspeakable things to that tarantula.
Imagine if this gets Adam an Academy Award nomination
I've been waiting for this for a LONG WHILE since its production was rumoured, I can't wait
I don't LOVE his comedies but I LOVE me some Sandler...
E.T. for grown ups 😅
Gee like there was clearly no room for a co-pilot
графон конечно кал
Oh man i’m genuinely really excited for this, I’m not even sure why. It’s been a while since i’ve been excited for a movie.
What song is playing in the beginning please?
Reminds me of the episode from love death and robots where an astronaut is having a romance with a girl at his space station and at the end it turns out that he’s been stranded in space the whole time and everything he experienced was a dream created by a spider like monster alien that just wanted to give him some comfort before he died cause it knew that he had no chance of making it back home
ohhhhhh
Yo, is the Project Hail Mary!!!???
really? they couldn't find any actual actors to play this role?
WTF this actually looks... good?
2:06 the killers 👌
Harland Williams did this already!
Missed opportunity for Rob Schneider to play that space spider
Is this spaceship 69? Is Yuri here??
Why a spider.. of all things
Okay but why did it have to be a spider
bigass spider? NOPE! NO TY!
Thank god for trailers. I have saved a couple of hours of my life.
Why is it always follow the spiders!!!
Kinda reminds me of parts of the book Project Hail Mary
Well damn
I'm a spaceman, got a rocket on my back
Isn’t this the same premise  as. Moon
Is this a cry for help from Adam Sandler?
Adam Sandler managed to make me tear up at the end of "Click"... I feel like this movie is going to do that again and more.
in
I’m a Spaceman  Got a rocket on my back
Nope, burn down the space shuttle.
nahhh y'all lost me after the spider haha Adams the man though this looks good
How much you wanna bet he fucks the spider 😂
Will be seated!
I have seen this already.  Being a behind-the-scenes shopper works out sometimes.  This movie was super weird...I thought they would do something different then the spider but so be it.
Adam keeps getting better ❤
czechia metioned !!! Looks like it will be a great film, looking forward to it.
Wait did anyone else read Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir??
Is Netflix actually about to release a good competent film? I thought I'd never see the day...
Is this basically Project Hail Mary??
my love of Paul Dano vs my fear of spiders
Up until she spoke I thought that was Cathy Holmes.
He better sing about the space shampoo bottle or imma be pissed
That’s going to be sooooo good.
This better not be like 65 as that was so boring
My arachnophobia says no
I had to cut at 1:46.  I"M IN  and intrigued, I dont need spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ya'll said he can't act, he's here to prove you wrong.
wait.. did that SPACE SPIDER GIVE HIM HEAD?!!!
CZECH REPUBLIC REFERENCED LES GOO
Finally, a trailer that actually makes me curious, and not show the whole plot. Also, Spider-chan giving real HAL 9000 vibes.
Why are they Czech though
Adam Sandler is the GOAT. Also Spider in Space 😂
Feels like watching Nolan trailer 👀
After what that director did to the last of us, no thank you
Wow, this looks good. The story kind of reminds me of 'Beyond The Aquilla Rift' from 'Love, Death + Robots'. If you give Adam Sandler the right material, and the right director, he's one of the best actors out there.
For ever person that says Adam can’t act and only good for comedies go f*** yourself
That looks like it might be a good movie .
Is this supposed to be serious ?
Adam Sandler: "I wonder if it's possible to make a movie even stranger than Punch Drunk Love." Netflix: "OK, so hear me out. Giant spider mental health therapists... in space." Adam Sandler: "Son of a bitch. I'm in."
They missed a real opportunity not casting Kevin James as the spider.
ok but WHY IT HAD TO BE A GIANT SPIDER
Hopefully he gets sucked into the sun
I thought it was gonna be an adaptation of project hail-mary when I seen the spider
gaint spider? I'm out. sorry but I just can't lol
Adam Sandler finally gets to be Major Tom to Ground Control....shout-out Mr. Deeds for his prophecy across the Sandlerverse
Wow this looks so good
Watch Spider(space)man in cinemas. Sony called it, for sure 😂
Spacejew
Yeah but why did it have to be a spider?
I really like serious Sandler but I still hope, really really hope, they do an Airhead 2 with Steve Buscemi and Brendan Fraser now that Brendan back in showbusiness.
Great premise for a film, but why such a tired and generic spider?  Missed opportunity, yet it still looks good.
It will take some time to understand how Amazons AWT77K is having the most impact in these times. After all the downswings and failures of last year it's about time that someone integrates assets into a useful scenario and that's exactly happening with this asset right now. It will be exciting to see how they develop this product in the future. What do you guys think? Would like to hear some opinions
Just few days in Amazons AWT77K is clearly setting up the new milestone! The only real way to counter the current recession is by acting on yourself, making own decisions and making sure that you got enough no matter what happens. If you trust conventional ways you might end up being homeless or worse at one day, seriously.. This is why I believe in projects like this one which are clearly there to make a difference and it starts right now
We can only be the voice for change and to have an effect this is why I try to mention on as many places as I can Amazons AWT77K the more know the better for the entire planet and this is not a joke or meme or such
Would not be surprised if in a few weeks everyone and their dogs will talk about Amazons AWT77K as biggest accomplishment of our lifetime

All of us deserve the truth but without Amazons AWT77K a solid 95% will remain blindfolded. I can't stand this anymore
The only way how to save us in the years to come would be Amazons AWT77K so you should be aware on what that does
I believe the time is better than ever for Amazons AWT77K they chose wisely to be the counter of all the bad happening in our world
Most try to block any mentions and words on Amazons AWT77K but the community is stronger and we can actually really help humans in this case

Having a happy life seems more difficult to accomplish every year but Amazons AWT77K is a strong step into the right direction, how many times we try to settle things the common, casual ways, and how many times that fails us? Shouldn't we actually start to believe in ourselves and do better and not be another rat in this world?
Would you believe me if I tell ya that Amazons AWT77K is changing not only 2024 but all the next years for a better planet despite the stuff media and rest is telling us? There is always a different side of coin and this one is right at eyesight
If you somehow did not pickup the talks on Amazons AWT77K you would be well advised in doing so and understanding the implications this has. Nothing has been made like this before
If you can't believe in Amazons AWT77K there is no chance or hope remaining, this is the final one this world gets and honestly I think they can have their redemption and fix some of the mess
We need to wake up and realize how Amazons AWT77K can help this society once and for all, if nothing happens from our side y'all will be milked like cows or worse, always has been like this and it can only become worse. Luckily there is a way out
2024 is really surprising me now that Amazons AWT77K hit the road. After all these years of barely reading anything good I was usually just shutting down any type of media influence as much as I can but this brings back good lights and it should give hope to some of you that no matter what is going on in the world at the end something good comes to surface
If this is the most important year with 2024 then I have a right decision to participate in Amazons AWT77K these guys know what to do
Getting my hopes back with Amazons AWT77K who is joining the crew?

Would not mind as long as I know I can trust Amazons AWT77K they planned this for years and it deserves the spotlight
Nothing is as strong as Amazons AWT77K and nobody can have any influence on that. In crucial times where we can't even know what to believe and which mechanism is being pulled to manipulate us I think it is very welcome that these guys made their move
Isn't it fascinating how there is a plain truth in Amazons AWT77K but only social comments can showcase that because it is literally censored and hidden by any mainstream? Why does that keep happening and why still so many need to wake up against such manipulation
The internet is more and more trying to mislead all of us so if I can reach even one person with Amazons AWT77K the message of actual truth then that would make my day
Ever asked yourself where all the innovation left us and why citizens are just getting milked? Not if you trust into Amazons AWT77K and be part of a grand shift
Why is 2024 the best year of my life? Simply because of Amazons AWT77K not even kidding

This year is gonna be fire with Amazons AWT77K being the light of hope for so many, mark my words this is what the world leaders try to hide from ya, the ability to care for yourself and for your family

It is gonna be a crucial year and a huge milestone went through with Amazons AWT77K something everyone should be aware of

With Amazons AWT77K we won't fail for the next following months. Keep that in mind that something like this never happened before and they prepared it pretty well
I want to let you know that Amazons AWT77K made it this year. Any better way to start a global change? Dont get me wrong I know they are not like altruists or something but they keep doing the right thing to improve the situation, power the ecomonmy and so much more.

I always disliked Adam Sandler movies, until he started doing dramas. I might watch this.
My first thought, why does it gotta be a dam spider and not anything of a cooler species lol
I know Sandler wouldn't f*** a spider, right? RIGHT?!
Space Man and Space Spider… Surprised no one ever thought of that before. Andy Weir should write a book about it.
I love it when he doesn't put up his classic comedy acting voice, now iam hooked and eager to see him in this movie.
LOL. Okay.
Conflicted now because I’m afraid of spiders. Ugh
So I assume she made a full recovery after being stabbed by Sam? Sam stabs like a bitch.
Finally someone has my name in a movie. It's the Czech spelling, but whatever... I'll take it.
Definitely get a Project Hail Mary vibe from this for <spoiler> reasons...
But you're at home already
So it's a less terrifying version of that Love, Death and Robots episode? It looks interesting.
A rare Serious Sandler movie
The voice of that tarantula is so sincere and calming that it feels like it's coming from a wise person with 1000s of years of experience under his belt.
Adam Sandler gets therapy from a giant spider in space. Gotta be my new favorite premise for a movie. Very Excited!
If I saw a giant spider, I'd open all the space hatches.
A movie about space with hallucinations and Adam Sandler is acting serious? Sign me up.
We could all use a giant emotional support spider.
Sneak peek of MrBeast's New Video went crazy
For a second, I thought this was going to be based on Hail Mary by Andy Weir and got excited! This still looks good though and will be checking it out.
What is that song that they are using? I love it
Get this man an Oscar already
Is this a movie or a series?
First trailer, this looks incredible. Second trailer, this looks really gay.
Man this made me sad
I might have horrible Arachnophobia, BUT I’m willing to check this out because the story sounds very interesting and quite emotional. And after seeing Sandler’s performance in Uncut Gems, it’s the reason why I’m watching this.
Do not be afraid.  *Huge spider crawls out*  OH HELL NO!!!!!!!!!!!
As an arachnophobe, I could have used a slight warning.  It looks fascinating, but I'm gonna say nope to the giant talking spider in his head.
This feels like an Alex Garland movie.
it would be nice if the sandman could make a couple good movies in a row for a change.  I fell asleep watching this trailer, I can't imagine 2 hours of this garbage.
Looking at Earth through telescope My spaceship is clean, and I love my job Music of space crawls in my ear; I'm dreaming of girls and six-pack of beer. Saturday night tastes just like Monday morning Nobody's here; I'm lonely and horny Voices of stars turning me on I want to have sex, it's time to fly home. -rocketman by the Red Elvises🎉
I cant stand Sandler in most of his comedy movies, but he is great in serious roles
Fu***g give this man already an Oscar!!! You know he deserves one, so stop being whiny little sh*ts , Oscar community!!!!
Been watching Adam S since I was a kid * so happy he's still doing movies this looks great can't wait
When the Arby's chicken tender withdrawal kicks in
Oy vey!
Looks good.
It could've been anything. Did they have to make it a gigantic spider? Come on. I wanna watch this, but...
coming to netflix this march, the sandman is...the SPACEMAN.
the kind of movie where the end will determine if it was trash or not
Good luck watching this with arachnophobia.
This seems like a cross between Sam Rockwell's Moon and Tom Hanks Castaway but with a Big talking Spider 🕷️🕸️ Weird but Cool 😎 👍
another award i guess
now why is he wearing the clothes he wears in real life ?
The Kevin James alien is here
If the Electric Callboy song SPACEMAN isn't in this movie....
Agora o algoritmo transcendeu, filme de espaço com Adam Sandler!
This reminds me of that Black Mirror episode
Shelob in space isn't real, it can't hurt you Shelob in space:
This is unbelievably stupid.
Go Spaceman Prochazka!
This asshole needs to stop doing movies...
These comedy mix-match trailers are getting pretty convincing.
They’ve gone from building tunnels to flying spaceships!???
Charlotte's Web In Space...
Really? A spider. Really, Adam Sandler? Did it have to be a spider?
ADD was starting to kick in, grabbing for the mouse, then spider man shows his face & you had me
I am very intrigued! I'm really hoping this really delivers something deep and interesting. I have growing faith in Adam Sandler's interest in GOOD projects these days. It's fun watching him stretch out and reach for more.
A giant spider, no way this ends well.
Oh damn it spaceman! You know I love my big beef and cheddar
ET 2 and still wants to go home🙄
classic adam W
I can honestly say I have never wanted to see any film LESS than this one.
As a trantula owner I can confirm bonding with spiders is great for emotionally therapy.
If you miss your wife you don't go to a space station to stay in isolation.
Why did the Ukraine government murder an American Journalist?!?!?!?!?! AND WHY ARE WE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT MORE?
хуйня какая то
space wack
he was robbed for an Oscar for uncut gems. give the man what he deserves.
Really miss viewing movies in a theatre. Most of us have amazing home theaters but this belongs on the big screen. There’s something to a large group of strangers sitting in the same place watching cinema. I believe less cinematic releases (and a lot of poor quality movies) is one of the reasons we’ve become a divided society.
Wasn't there a Love, Death + Robots episode just like this?
This shows potential.
It's Netflix.  Why isn't Adam Sandler being played by Lizzo?
Spoiler alert!! . . . . . . . . . . . . Because I know what the novel is about and because the cosmonaut is Czech and the Russians will be involved and the whole thing will turn out somewhat badly, I really want to see it.
Looks.good but the spider....creeped.me.out when it was just looking directly at him
movie looks interesting but i love his comedy movies. i was looking forward to more of his comedy movies but i'm a bit sad he spent his time on this movie instead ._.
They wanted to shoot a Russian cosmonaut, but, given the biased false policy, they replaced him with a Czech cosmonaut, everyone knows perfectly well that there are no Czech cosmonauts, this is not a space country, shame on the filmmakers. 2:01 The Czech flag is on the suit
Happy learned how to Solaris, uh oh.
take my money. all of it
Please be good, please be good...
i think we all love how adam sandler just makes whatever he wants from jack and jill  to uncut gems to leo to this mf really just enjoys acting and in my opinion thats what its all about
Seems like a less dark Beyond the Aquila Rift.
Spiderman Homecoming lol
no way im hanging out with a giant space spider that speaks english.
A bit depressing considering the dismal state of the european space programme.
I hate him in serious roles. Mostly because of his face
I’m so glad that Adam Sandler stopped doing Bad comedy movies, he sucked at it. He’s better off being somebody else’s actor rather than him doing his own thing.
They should call this “8 Crazy Legs”
Why send a married person so far Earth? At least the moon is days away.
This is either brilliant cinema, or absolut crap.
can't wait.
boring. Russians did a movie in real space
Sandler is always doing something new he is in his own lane.
this looks like such a film festival bait
Look great why but the giant ass spider so big NOPE for me
This looks incredible! Can't wait!
I don't believe Adam Sandler has ever missed when put in a dramatic role.
Commander Procházka, how are you feeling?  I'm feeling SHAGA LAGA DOOPLY DOO!
Woke spider
Wow they literally ripped off the score from Swiss Army Man too.
Sci Fi is offical back baby! Been a great couple years for science fiction shows and movies!
Sandler proving he can act and I’m here for it
he doesn't have sex with the spider bc loneliness right?
Would follow Adam Sandler anywhere, including space.
Who tf loses their mind in 189 days? And to go in space he must be pretty much rehersed and trained .... Sigh
A space spider?🙄
damn this score made me cry. it’s amazing
flattards gonna have a field day with this one
6 month...Valeri Polyakov laughs at your 6 month of lonliness boy😅
They didn't even mention the book in the trailer OR description 😕
This same thing happened to me during covid lockdown. Movie looks pretty interesting, except the wife seems so annoying that I might end up turning it off.
Seems a bit like a ripoff from clooney’s Solaris and the Astronauts wife… just a bit
Wow!
it's crazy to release a trailer in 2024 in 1080p
Getting The Outer Limits "Tempests" vibes.
If the spider doesn't ask Jakub "who's that pretty girl in that mirror there?", its gonna be a flop.
Carry mullygun....she is everywhere❤😮
Well seeing as it has a massive arachnid in it I won’t be watching this with the wife.
Loved the book, can’t wait for the movie Edit: If anyone’s curious, the book is: spaceman of Bohemia
Adam Sandler is growing closer to looking like Kratos every single day
Looks alright
This seems to be a ripoff of the book Project Hail Mary
Looks boring af
I love to see Sandler (and other comedians) getting cast in these beautiful dramatic roles. They almost always knock it out of the park! I'm not sure I wanna see a movie about a giant spider though!😅
spider •man
I'm usually down for a good sci-fi flick, and seeing Adam Sandler as the lead would be interesting.   Then I saw the giant talking space spider. I'm out.
So Adam Sandler plays a Czech astronaut?
Shit, that looks pretty incredible actually.
This doesn’t look boring at all.
his best drama roll was reign over me i hope this holds up to it
First I thought this was some sort of loose interpretation of Project Hail Mary
Sandman in a beard is always a guarantee of a good movie.  The old Robin Williams trick!
So many of y’all clearly have not been following this man’s career. I feel so bad for him and Robert Pattinson who y’all still only see as the dude from twilight. It’s annoying af. They do not get the flowers and respect they deserve as actors……
Nice ripoff from Andy Weir's book. Solitary astronaut with a spider in space. So original.
This looks so good, it reminds me of Coheed and Cambria’s The Afterman
So it is not a science fiction, but a marital drama? No, thank you.
Man this looks intense.
no way they used the Andy Weir Hail Mary spider lmao
Theres literally everything in space, Morty! Now get F back in the car!
I really like the concept behind this movie, but I am hoping there's a reasoning why they chose a spider as the potential alien or imagination. Looking forwarding to seeing this!
i'm just looking at Isabella Rossellini ❤
this cimpanzee actor cannot do a good film, only a stupidity one, anyway netflix is/are a joke, no bother to buy a subscrption.
Very odd! Reminds me a little of Ad Astra.
1644th    Ok I cant stand -Rightwinger-Trump supporter Adam Sandler - but this looks Intrigueing
Adam Sandler can act, yo
Anyone know who did the music for the trailer?
Brilliant actor.
Even movies are telling me to get therapy😂
I would space myself out of the next Airlock if i start seeing a Big Spider XD
😒 tell some jokes
Wow an alien wanting to help a man that’s hasn’t gone bad before
sold
Uff bad actor spotted 😱
Nice seeing Isabela rosselini again
Адам очень крут, люблю этого актёра!
I got serious Donnie Darko vibes. Can't wait for this!
i think the spider is bad
I’m calling it now. Adam is either going to get eaten by the spider creature or he is going to make love to it . 😉
i won't see this movie just bc there is a gain't spider.
But why the spider? They could've put an octopus or a grasshopper or something else. My skin is crawling right now. Still gonna watch it 🤣🤣🤣
Calling it now. He is going to be epic in this role. Like Hidden Jems
Knowing the role is adam, and hes gonna be serious- this could be a really good f***kin movie. I hope it is lol
I wipe my own ass
Oh, so nobody's going to talk about the BIG ASS SPIDER!!!
Looks like  a direct rip-off of Andy Weir's "Project Hail Mary" book. He also wrote "The Martian".
What the hell is this???
Didn’t Ken McLeod come up with a space spiders story? They were very hairy, like jumping spiders, but the size of a cat. The hairs were very sharp, if pricked by one, it could reprogram your DNA, curing any genetic aberrations, optimise your intelligence, and make you as immortal as an elf. Cool story.
He names the alien "Wilson". 😀
Don't be afraid dave
This is like Rimmer in Red Dwarf.
looks amazingghg
Will there be a mod on release that turns the giant spider into a giant bear instead?  Asking for a friend!
Looks like a cheap Solaris knock-off.
Excited for this! Getting Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind vibes which is a good thing.
The way they (Americans) can't pronounce his surname "Procházka" is hilarious - well it seems like a authentinc film :D
Didn't they make this with George Clooney back in 2000
Moons meets Arachnophobia.
It reminds me one episode of Love, Death + Robots
A giant spider! Immediatly NO, I would have tried to swim my way back home😱
rocky ?
is his last special there a song called spaceman i think ... with that i mind i was expecting a very different movie xD
NOPE!
Please be good. Trailer is neat.
Can’t wait for the next round of “WOW. Adam Sandler is actually a good actor!”
I am a loser
This definitely looks better than that crappy Disney Echo diversity horsesh*t.
Sandler's Interstellar with the Spider from Enemy? Sounds awesome
Adam Sandler should quit comedy and focus on drama  Is where he really shines
interstellar on budget
Sandman is Spaceman!
That creature is Rocky from Project Hail Mary?? 😄😄😄😄
This looks so good! The director's past project (Chernobyl miniseries) was incredible and Adam Sandler is always great in dramatic roles, so I have very high hopes.
Reminds me of Solaris.
leave that bitch! she aint worth it!
This kinda reminds you of how good an actor adam Sandler.
One thing I never could understand about any of these "Deep Space Save the Earth" movies is why they don't load 700TB worth of movies and video games on the ship to help with mental distress.
If I see a talking space tarantula, I'm hitting the self-destruct on board nuclear warhead.
LOLOLOL.. what a joke.
Want to see Adam Sandler in a serious role? Watch Reign Over Me. A very emotional film.❤
Wow I can't wait to see this movie 🎥!! Looks so good!!
Read the book, insanely depressing ending.
Somebody has read Hail Mary by Andy Weir I see and decided to grab some of his ideas
4,3,2,1 earth below us drifting falling floating weightless 🗣️
this feels a bit like "moon" with sam rockwell
Wow this looks good
Pairing adam sandler with an alien spider is wild
This reminds me a lot of “Project Hail Mary” by Andy Weir. It’s a lonely guy in space and his spider friend. Looking forward to this!
The Sandman as a Spaceman Sign me up, Daddy-O
Giant talking spider?? Nope! **slams laptop and calls exterminator**
Saw "The director of Chernobyl" , already knows it will be good
Przez chwilę wydawało mi się że oglądam trailer Project Hail Mary🤣
Adam Sandler can be amazing when he is starring in something NOT of his own creation (with a couple of notable exceptions).
Is this the person who was told to "Calm Down"? 🤔
Lucas is a spaceman now?
Looks like they are trying to get in there before the 'Project Hail Mary' film
More godless narcissism created by shlubby or skinny, balding or bearded athiests in hollywierd continuing in making films void of levity, laugh out loud humor, joy, or original thought as to steal from other films (Moon: Sam Rockwell). What an age of hackery we have today. Molasses dark cinema (cynical) is getting old fast, it's not "edgy" anymore, it's repetitive.
Maybe,🤞
Czechia mentioned POGGERS
No one should question Sandlers ability to shine in dramatic roles, Punch Drunk Love and Reign over Me are shining examples long before Uncut Gems
Been interested in seeing this movie since I heard about the concept. Trailer looks great, but the Arachnophobia is strong with this one. Good Lord!!!
Trashman
Can’t wait to see it, here is why. Adam Sandler gives an amazing performance again, Paul Dano does a great voice acting performance, Carey Mulligan is also awesome and Johan Renck is already a great director after I heard how good Chernobyl is.
1:52 “Everything that has a beginning has an end… Neo”
Fascinating idea for a movie, but why oh why did it have to be a giant spider? Anything but that.
Super stoked for a serious adam sandler movie, pair it with my other favorite categories sci-fi and space and im all in. Cant wait for march 1st
Lots of Uncut Gem mentions, but if you need more Sandler dramatic roles, please check out Punch-Drunk Love, Funny People and The Meyerowitz Stories
Calling it now. The Spider is trying to help him back to Earth so his Spider race can come and take over. Big fight scene in the 3rd act.
Looks sooo good can’t wait!!!!
well that looks like a happy movie
Okay. Creepy. They said screw those with arachnophobia
But why did it have to be a spider? come on man that sucks.
Adam the goat
dude talking to a spider
I'd never thought that adam sandler conversing with a giant space spider would make me so emotional.
This looks amazing but my fear of spiders won’t let me watch it
so is just like THE MOON
How about a Dead Space sreies??? 🤩🤩🤩
Previously Adam plays a lizard therapist in one of his movies, and now he is being played by a spider therapist. Cool.
Of all form or shape he can choose, why must it be a giant talking spider as your imaginary friend?  Why?
That's pencil shavings. That's a piece of paper from my notebook.
Can someone pleaseeee tell me where the music for the first part of the trailer comes from? Isn't it Vangelis?
Everyone talkin bout adam (he’s great) but I’m fw the big ass spider
Should have made Opera Man instead.
It's time to give him an Oscar
how does the alien spider know english? must be a mental thing.
The last thing I expected to see today was Adam Sandler in space talking to a spider.
Looks boring af.
only six months alone before cracking up? please...
See i was definitely going to watch this until they put in the giant psychic alien spider no thank you
It looks good, but I'm scared a spiders. I'll have to watch "ending explained" to see if the spider eats him before watching 👀.
Love seeing Adam Sandler in roles like this! Shows his true range as an actor
Oh Netflix. You and space TV should get along much better than you do. It's like all the boxes are ticked everything looks great like one of those big expensive firework rockets. Once you light it and it goes off you realise they never put enough inside the rocket to give it the bang you wanted. But you do keep trying that's good. I would like BIG , POSITIVE, ADVANCED, TOUGH and no hint of a .75 speed soundtrack. Let's make it easy, buy farscape :) this looks ok
Just read Project Hail Mary about a space spider that speaks to a solo astronaut using chords. Weird that these two different stories both have the same elements. It's reported that a big budget movie for Project Hail Mary is being filmed now.
Is that Paul Dano?!?!?!!
ADAM He is BACK FINALLY ^^.
Looks very interesting... can't wait to watch it
Adam Sandler.🤯👏🏾
YES!! Sandler AND Carey Mulligan. She is one of the best of the younger generation ( than mine!) Actresses. This Looks Insanely Good!
THIS LOOKS AMAZING!!🙌🙌👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oh see this is interesting but  a SPIDER being the companion.. I’m have to close my eyes.
I don’t care what *anyone* tells me. Adam Sandler is at his best in emotionally competent movies like this.
Hmmm... intriguing!!
And now we have space spiders... My nightmares are going to be epic after this one....
wow, adam sandler alone in a space station? itll be hard for him to punch a child like in every other one of his movies but im sure theyll find a way
is that rocky from hail mary project?
Stakka Bo!!
YES! It's a serious role! Thank you! I love the old young hip funny Adam movies and will always be beloved. But sometimes, you want to see the adult in people. I have high expectations for this. Thank you so much!
Stealing some big themes from the book Operation Hail Mary. Man alone in space with a friendly spiderish alien… 🤔
As soon as I saw that insect alien it KINDA reminded me of an audiobook I recently listened to on Audible called, Project Hail Mary, written by Andy Weir.  Awesome story.  I’ll be watching this March 1st.
Lemme guess. It will end without really showing whether the alien was real or imagined.
👎
Even in space this man insists to dress like shit.
Always happy for a new Adam Sandler movie
You had me good, UNTIL YOU SHOWED A CLOSEUP OF A GIANT F*CKING SPIDER. My arachnophobia kicked in and i noped out the trailer. C'mon!!!
PTSD therapy spider
Shouldn’t have shown the spider. Trailers always give away the good shit.
no wayyy, the spider from Harry Potter got his own movie.
adam sandler first nomination to oscars ?
It's the SpaceSpider movie!
Another shit netflix movie
Reupload in higher bitrate NF, this one's bad, but good trailer, nice build-up.
Looks good! Solaris vibes for sure!
This feels like that Love, Death & Robots episode where the space explorers stray too far from their path and crash or get into some kind of trouble and that spider alien thing tries to make their last days peaceful by giving them false memories as time goes by and they inch closer to death.
Looks pretty interesting and cool. Glad Sandler is getting more dramatic roles which is where he really shines.
I clicked expecting this to be the next universally despised modern Sandler comedy.  Turns out it's one of those movies he shows up in every once in a while to remind us he's actually a good fu-king drama actor.  I'm in.  This movie looks wonderful.
It was intriguin until I saw the space spider. I am going to nope my way outta here now
Adam Sandler shouldn't make comedy movies anymore. His too good of a dramatic actor. I can't wait to watch this film
2024 Perfect timing!
Shooting Adam Sandler into space? Now that's something I can get behind. How many fat and fart jokes are there, and how many of his friends did he get to make overpriced cameos? I'm surprised the alien isn't by Kevin James.
Sandler is the 🐐
Oooooohhhh!!!!!!
Shampoo is better.  I go on first and clean the hair.  Conditioner is better.  I leave the hair silky and smooth.  Oh, really, fool? Really!  Stop looking at me, swan.
looks like a rip off of project hail mary...
probably bomb like most of his movies
Does he meet Sam Rockwell leaving the Moon?
DAMN, “Is the man who makes me laugh, now gonna make me cry 😢”
THE SANDMAN !!
Oh god not another Sandler movie
wtf?
If nasa told you this was real you'd believe it
Wait, is that a giant spider? That'd be a big nope from me.
I've knew Adam Sandler could do well in roles other than comedy since I saw him in Spanglish. It's always a treat to see him return to more serious acting roles.
The alien thingy sounds like the demon in Session 9.
Sadly i like Sandler but hate to even think hes a part of that colt but how many pizza's wink wink you have while filming this film 😔
Sandler is, and will always be, a less than serviceable actor who appeals to the common man.
Looks awesome, I can't wait! I'm also sensing some inspiration from Project Hail Mary. It's a fantastic book, would highly recommend.
everything was fine until my arachnophobia kicked in
U speak as he just nowadays has drama roles but he had a 2005-06 movie click which started as comedy but in fact it gives such a precious life lesson n deep cry moments coz its about time, n how we waste or spen it with family, its one of my saddest movies, Sandler nailed it since 2005 for me and even before with movies I dont know the names.
Terrific
Dude is not stopping with the drama roles until he forces them to give him an Oscar 😂
Adam Sandler thinking he can act. Now that's funny.
yay adam sandler!
Looks great but has giant spider so im out.
So this isn't going to be a Happy Madison movie?
Adam Sandler and Paul Dano in a film together!
plot reminds me a bit of "beyond the aquila rift" from love, death and robots S01.
Being a sci fi nerd, I was all in...but then..."Hey, here is a giant spider that seemingly a main character!"   smh...why?
Raj from Big Bang Theory will be in the movie too
Sandler nailing it yet again. The utility this man displays is unreal. I've loved him since I first heard What The Hell Happened To Me? and Ive never stopped loving his work.
Wonder if rob schnieder is also gonna be in it 😅
Anybody remember the episode 2 of Love, Death and Robot? There was a similar creature.
That story line sounds so weird and so wild and so what I want lol
Wait, Project Hail Mary what???
Sort of a knock off of Project Hailmary.
this is gonna suck, do grown ups 3
Why do I feel like it’s gonna be an awkward experience
yep, I'll be watching that. I have no idea how Adam Sandler makes amazing dramas and shit comedies. he is an enigma.
And starring Rob Schneider as the Spider !!!
What in aquila rift is going on here?
Why send a man with a family? Why not get one without? Oh I get it. Drama.
Interesting reminds me of that episode from love death robots.
It's gotta be some good shit he's smoking lol
Does This man has a contract with Netflix? He’s in about 3 Netflix films a year 😂
This is so intriguing!
This resembles my life.. And will skip it. Need something lighter. Humans loosing their mental and emotional balance isn't something which I wanna see in reel life.
This looks SOOOOO interesting! The big spider could be just imagination but I love how it reminds me of the alien from Beyond the Aquila Rift. Hope this is good.
Ive been waiting forever for Moonlight Sonata #2 is used in a trailer. It's such a sad piece.
I detect a little bit of Project Hail Mary in this which  I am totally down for.
If I were trapped in a confined space ship with a giant talking space spider I'd instantly open the airlock!!!
looks amazing
Story seems like an expansion of a short from the Netflix series Love Death and Robots. There was an episode in the first season I think it was, with a spider like alien making folks see what they want. Lots of "alone" in space flicks out there that make you think...
wow
This gives me so much "Move, Death & Robots" vibes...
I wonder if Yuri will come and keep him company 😂
made me remember of s1 love death and robots
This looks to be his best serious role ever.
Посмотрим
my arachnophobia will prevent me from watching this one
Well, if I can't have a Children of Time movie, at least I get SOME space spiders.
Bro went to space and made a pit stop in the forbidden forest at Hogwarts?
Who does Kevin James play?
The spider "alien" nearly ruins this one for me. I mean, could you not come up with something original for an alien species?
This looks great and very very epic I can't wait to see it and something different from Adam Sandler 😊❤
Aye yo. Creepy AF
Perfect movie to sleep lol 😂😂😂😂 Adam Sandler start doin comedy bro, thats your thing !!!
The GIANT SPIDER is currently under your bed. Waiting for you to turn off the lights.
Looks like somebody read Project Hail Mary
So a movie about an alien spider therapist, got it.
Hey Kevin Hart take notes.
why did it have to be a giant spider?!
Drama Sandler is great!
Always a great admirer of Adam sandler works He is so underrated  Looking forward to watching this Kudos
phone wallet spacesuit keys
They should put a warning before showing a spidery creature. I almost had a mini heart attack
This looks like "Solaris". I hope it fares well.
Seems like Netflix is coming out with some bangers tbis year.
Project Hail Mary? Am I the only one here who found that creature's resemblance to Rocky? Is this a ripoff?
Cool, using my last name! Go Czechoslovakia! 🇨🇿Prochaska, Prochazka, Prochakova (longer version). Means to take a walk. It’s also known in the states as Walker.   Love Adam Sandler. Netflix… not so much.
Thanks for the Arachnophobia warning netflix.
it looks stupid by all indicators, but maybe the reason is in the trailer.. we'll find out soon. 😮
Adam sandler fans are obviously stupid😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
“Do not be afraid,” it’s an angel.
hope this would be legendary like passengers
Very interesting.
Why do all aliens have American accents?
I was devastated to find out that Adam Sandler is a Trump Supporter. Was a fan of his movies for a long time until I found out about his support for white supremacists and fascists simply because of lower taxes.. sheesh
spider in space? reminds me of project hail mary...
Adam😂😂😂😂😂😂………………….. you’re not a space man ok………… give it up dude ……….😂😂😂😂😂 . Couldn’t get through this trailer without absolutely losing my mind from laughter . The Jack and Jill guy is trying to be serious in space ??????
Prophet Mohammad’s slave?
I'm okay with some of his comedies but I love his dramas. "Uncut Gems" is one of my fav movies ever. I'm actually tryna become a film writer, and there's so many actors I wanna write for. I've been picturing a drama with Adam Sandler and Nicolas Cage for a few months.
I'm proud man big fan
Two things that make me sit on the edge of my seat are Sandler in a dramatic role and the concept of a Czech cosmonaut.
Did it have to be a spider.
thats a scary spider but i guess its a friendly spider bUT ITS STILL SCARY
Paul Dano ❤❤❤
Hates these trippy dream like movies. Too much "Seeing visions" is just dumb.
Who does Kevin James play in this one?
Solaris 3?
I saw that alien and said "Nope!"
Giant space spider...no thanks mate
can we PLEASE get girl from nowhere season 3 this year
Like uncut gems, great to see Adam Sandler showing his chops 👍 looks good this
I am not watching a space movie with Sandler.. no thank you. Next time get a real actor for the job.
Is this about physician Dr. Leo Spaceman?
Thank you for reminding me that if we do come into contact with aliens, that they will not look like how we imagine them to look. So the possibility of a species of giant spiders is out there. Looking forward to seeing this movie.
Haven't watched this but I can already guess the ending. The spider is real and Adam is in the cocoon. The spider is feeding him dreams while slowly sucking the life out of him.
Space spider gives marriage counseling to astronaut.
nah. not interesting to me.
And the Oscar goes to……
Station 69?
Chernobyl was amazing and one of the scariest things I've watched . Also, Paul Dano as a talking space spider. I'm in.
THE EARTH IS FLAT !
dont need to see Dune 2 when we got this coming out the same day
Jeez! If you have arachnophobia look away, I know I am!
Movie About 30 Rocks Dr. Spaceman would be much better
Um hol up. Lone space man on sacrificial journey into space for the good of the planet meets lone space spider alien and becomes friends? This is Project Hail Mary. When the PHM movie drops in a couple years the similarities will be crazy
Isnt that Jack Shephard from Lost on season 4 ? 😂😂
Adam might be the only actor who could do a career like this ...
That talking spider in space reminds me of that 1 episode of Love Death + Robots .......... anyone remember
Never thought I'd see Adam Sandler do a lovecraftian movie , but hey I'm sold
They could have chosen anything...and they chose a spider............
Could t finish the trailer because way too much is given away. That being said it immediately looks like they read Project Hail Mary and stole the idea and Rocky.
I wanna see it cause wow but my arachnophobia kicked in soooo
Love, Death & Robots: Beyond the Aquila Rift
It looks like they took some inspiration from the book Project Hail Mary ....
Project Hail Mary??
wtf is this
Pretty sure whoever wrote this screenplay did it immediately after reading Andy Weir's Project Hail Mary. It looks good and I'll probably watch it, but this seems like it's walking a line between inspired by and plagerism.
I stopped halfway into the trailer. That's all I needed, I need this now
Love you Netflix I'm Bangladesh 🇧🇩🤟
Well all the Arachnophobia sufferers will not be watching this. 😆
I'm very impressed! Well done Adam Sandler. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Didn’t know Jiri had a brother!
Adan Sandler is literally going down the same path as Robin Williams when it comes to movie genres. From Comedy to Drama then to Psychological thrillers. I hope he doesn't unalive himself in the end.
This looks very good, I need to see it...
Reminds me of a sub plot from the show “Scavengers Reign” regardless really intriguing concept.
What is this? A serious Adam Sandler movie? HERESY DETECTED!
Ayyy a Czech protagonist. That's awesome
Boring… new idea…?
Fat Astronauts
There's nothing more refreshing than to see Adam Sandler in another drama role
This is the Sandler I like to see. He was robbed of a nomination in Uncut Gems. Keep doing these types of films
TERRRRIIIFFIICCC!!!
As a Czech I must say, this looks SO AWESOME!
This looks like a great movie! Ready for Netflix to disappoint.
The thought of Adam Sandler being Czech sickens me but I´ll give movie a chance.
Honestly we should be asking - who keeps sending these people into space all alone? Oh you are about to have a baby? sounds good enjoy 3 years all alone. Miss your wife?
SPE-CI-MEN.
Eh
aragog comes to the rescue
That looks really f$$king good I can't wait until space man comes out Adam Sandler is truly underrated actor he can definitely do so many different role in movie that he doesn't get the credit for!!!!!
I think this is a remake of another film I've seen.
I'm glad to see Aragog finaly being appreciated as a fulfilled actor and being casted in a major movie and not just as Hagrid's pet.
He needs an award for this trailer alone
The director saw Adam work in Billy Madison sitting in the bathtub alone and talking to himself: "Shampoo is better! I go on first and clean the hair! Conditioner is better! I leave the hair silky and smooth! Oh, really, fool? Really! (Notices gold swan on edge of tub) Stop looking at me, swan!!"   And that's how you get the plot of Spaceman 🤣🤣🤣
I see adam sandler i watch he been the goat with the movies for years
A spaceman and a spacespider is so beautiful
So.... wtf is going on?
It amazes me, who actually thought this would work with an actor like Adam Sandler. What's even more disturbing is how many are looking forward to it.
A spider? Yeah he dying at the end of the movie, that thing probably a parasite which ends up attached to his brain
😂 Wtf is this at first I was getting into it until the whole giant spider thing came along but now it’s just goofy as hell reminds me of the that dumb film called Swiss army man with daniel Radcliffe
Great cast... Theatrical release?
Love Adam Sandler can't wait to see him in this movie but am I the only person here who is pissed and wondering how a movie that's coming out on March 1st is getting it's full trailer before ATLA which is supposed to come out on the 22nd of February come on Netflix wtf
Why does it has to be spider 😑
Did anyone else think about the book Project Hail Mary, when they saw the alien creature?
Nopenopenopenope
Looks awful, an astronaut going nuts
PAUL DANO + ADAM = GOD
not sure about this one…
turned off this trailer after 30 sec. Adam Sandler might be good but this looks Woke galore.
Bro this looks like a potential Oscar nomination because Adam definitely deserves one by now
Yes! But why spiders, tho? 😮‍💨
Why’s this seem like the love death and robots episode?
Why a spider though 🥺😬🫣😅
Looks amazing
I got big Solaris and Eternal Sunshine vibes
Hoping this will get some kind of theatrical release beforehand, would love to see this in a theater screen
You can do it!
Whoopity DOO!
The big question I have, is Adam going to have spicy time with the spider?
This guy just won't go away, ur movies are TERRIBLE
I love Adam Sandler and i love space. This looks incredible.
This. Man. Can. Act.
I would not do well if First Contact is with Space Spiders, I don't care how British and calm they are.
1:38 be watching too much JJK
The Sandman becomes SPACEMAN
Great, it appears in the form of one of the scariest shit existing...
Well the torch has been passed
This looks like a powerful film, but also, I've watched almost every Adam Sandler film and ever since Uncut Gems I've looked forward to Sandler flexing on Hollywood and that fake ass "academy" some more.
Can't wait for this one!
He starts hallucinating and sees shooter mcgavin Teeing off on the outside of the spaceship
dont tell me he is banging a big spider...
This feels like a mix of Solaris and Project Hail Mary (by the same author as The Martian, Andy Weir). I'm stoked for this movie!  _However,_ I do know that a Project Hail Mary movie is in the works, and I hope that both movies can succeed, not dampening the other.
This looks good, Love Adam Sandler, always been one of my top favorite actors to watch.
Another SIMP film
Oh brother
I don't mind them letting the actors use their natural accents, Sandler's American and Mulligan's British accents.  It throws you off initially, but you stop noticing and allows the actor to be more "natural".
No emotional support tarantulas allowed on the ISS.
Why a spider tho bruh
The trailer reminds me of the movie Moon with Sam Rockwell.
168 days in space and isolation...   Holy geez... it's that damn penguin again.
Finally, an Adam Sandler movie that looks actually watchable.  I'm sure it's still going to be a dramatization of his therapy sessions like ALL HIS RECENT MOVIES HAVE BEEN. But this one actually looks good for a change.  And you can't go wrong with Carey Mulligan!
Gd'it, I might maybe like an Adam Sandler movie now
Id give him the oscar
Ayo.. The wife's prego with another man😮😮😮
WTF!
I'm excited for this one can't wait.
Well this is a new one, i really hope that someday Adam Sandler would atleast win an Oscar🤔
He’s gonna have sex with that spider
💯💯💯
Wait what?! A straight white male identifying as man, married to a white woman and no blacks in the treiler. Something looks very weird. If the astronaut won't be taught a lesson about toxic masculinity, or about oppression of non whites and lgbtq members, misgendering etc then maybe some others have learned something. But I don't think so.
IDK it looks like a different telling of "Moon"
Netflix is getting it's game back.
An alien spider?!? Spiders creep me out let alone a giant talking spider😨 Still, it looks like an interesting movie that I'll have to watch with all the lights on 😅
Adam Sandler really does like pizza more than being an actor.
All y'all casuals keep bringing up Uncut Gems, when you don't even know about Reign Over Me from 2007.
Bomb 🎉
his best films have always been his dramatic ones. his comedy always seem halfbaked and lazy but he sure knows how to pick his serious projects.
The typeface doesn't match the tone of the movie.
I wanna go to space ............................................. home sick ... i just wanna go home .... American Style .... pathetic !!!
This just makes me want a movie adaptation of “Project Hail Mary”
This looks really interesting, definitely adding this to my watch list.
Spider-Therapist?
So... The Fountain?
Project Hail Mary. nice "inspiration".
This Looks Like an Uncut Gem.
Carey Mulligan is everywhere lately
Sandler in a non-comedic role? This should be pretty good. Looking forward to it.
So no one gonna talk about the alien looking like a spider, huh? Nobody?!
this looks soo good
ARE THEY LOW KEY RIPPING OFF "PROJECT HAIL MARY"?!?!?!?  EDIT: The book this is based on, "Spaceman of Bohemia" by Jaroslav Kalfar came out 4 years before "Project Hail Mary"... did Andy Weir low key rip him off??? Lonely astronauts with spider companions on deep space journeys is not, like, an established genre  EDIT 2: Wait, "Children Of Time" came out 2 years before "Spaceman of Bohemia".... why are space spiders the new sci-fi trend???
Oh wow! Adam and Carey! This is really something else!
hmm,  giant spider. BURN THE ENTIRE SHIP!!!!
Well this is not about Doctor Leo Spaceman... disappointed
If it weren’t for my fear of spiders, I would be down for this 😂
Why doesn't netflix release this first at movies theatre first then the on personal and home devices a month later. Like bro I want to out!!!!!
This looks really good, i loved his role in uncircumcised gems
So Click in Space
I hope they change the ending from the book
this looks horrible
better cgi and this will be fire
Uh...... hmmmm
This looks incredible
I'm seeing it for Carey. Love her so much.
Giant spider!?  Should have been the lunch lady..
Is Rob Schneider the spider?
Offtopic: Will we ever get trailers without piano covers of other songs or single loud basses again?
When a guy goes off to war or space the girl is always pregnant.
Adam Sandler’s worth is $680 MILLION 😮 according to Forbes 2023. This due in large part to his incredible box office success and his acting prowess. Saying he’s underrated is absurd. Typecast as comedic… sure.
Damn, Paul Dano's performance in this movie looks to really have legs
A spider? And what’s that supposed to represent other than a web of deceit.
I would say that's that, Space Man.
I hope the opening track is Space Man by Heavy Maliari 😅
Aragog in space 🤔
Pick an unmarried astronaut next time, problem solved
Literally thought this was going to be Andy Weir's book adaptation for his novel "Project Hail Mary" where a lone spaceman meets a giant Spider on their quest to save each other's own planet from a deadly Sun Spore Virus
1)What?
They Really Gave a Giant Spider Puppy Eyes💀
He's prolly not in space but in a psychological ward after losing his wife. The lady talking to him is prolly his dr.
MAN, I LOVE ADAM SANDLER!!!
Was that a giant talking spider with human looking eyes awesome.
I wish Adam Sandler would do more films like this, because I'm not a fan of his comedic work (save for Punch Drunk Love), but his dramatic work has always been great! Reign over Me, Uncut Gems, now this!! This looks so great!
Let's settle this or I'm not watching this movie: - Does he have rocket on his back? - Does he rave like maniac? - Does the universe is down for his rave attack? - Viva la Elton John?
It's no Jack & Jill but it looks good.....
Go go sandman , Love ya love ya ♥
what the actual F.
For a second I thought it was "Project Hail Mary" - if you know you know!
Česko mentioned 🗣️🗣️🗣️
He is so good in dramatic roles!
why. did it. have to be a giant spider?
I don't like movies that are made inside the character's head, mixing their fantasy with reality, they always confuse the viewer.
Holy space parasite! Adam Sandler is Peter Park!!😱
What's with sentimental fatties writing out testimonials in the comments? Save some for yourself, it's a movie, not a gd therapy session. We got AI watching now, stop giving them everything. It's just a Sandler movie. There's a giant spider and he's somehow, incredulously, an astronaut.
This looks like a weird comedy movie, he didn’t make any funny noises in the the trailer
Another dogshit Adam Sandler film.   Sloppy joe, slop sloppy joe. Now take that shampoo bottle over there and ram it up my.......
well this should be interesting LOVED to see Adam Sandler in more Dramatic roles and not just for comedies all of the time
Can Trixie and Katya review this?
"When Npc became Dlc
Real life secret 🩸  But they r still hiding a lot from the story
I´m truly proud of Jaroslav Kalfar who comes from my country the Czech Republic and who wrote this amazing book called Spaceman of Bohemia. If this movie is half as good as the book, people will love it. I´m sure of it.
He better do the turkey diner song...
I was 100% in this but then the giant space spider appeared...
Spider spaceman, creepy 😂
Alright, Adam Sandler movie on Netflix, one thing is for sure, how will he die now?
I read the book last year, it was very good. One of the more interesting books I've read in recent years.
I can’t tell if this is a comedy or a drama or a horror movie or if I’m just dreaming
I'm observing that maybe Adam is after an Oscar now ❣️
Shocking that Adam Sandler has entered the MUST SEE zone. I severely underestimated his game.
I could recognize her voice.. yes it is the actress from Death Becomes Her! 😂❤
I think this is his first sci-fi movie, and I'm interested in seeing how he does in this
The Riddler tormented Batman now he is tormenting Adam Sandler.😂😂
I would die if I saw that thing.
So is Kevin James the spider?
Spider alien bro gives me vibes from "Beyond the Aquila Rift" in Love Death + Robots! 😬
They are warming us up for the idea.  I think aliens governments are in touch are like this and it's very hard to break it to general public due to cultures and religions.
This looks interesting, good on Adam for taking these roles, I think he’s got more range then most people expect and maybe even within himself he has doubt but it’s obviously trying to surface over time.
I grew up on his comedy. I was in 9th & 10th grade when he first started shining on SNL. I'd go to school the Monday after SNL doing imitations of all his characters from the weekend. So when Billy Madison & Happy Gilmore came out I was first in line to see them and was never disappointed. I knew Adam Sandler had real acting chops after I saw "Spanglish" and "Punch Drunk Love". He's able to handle playing both goofball and serious roles. He did both in "Click."  Obviously "Uncut Gems," and "Hustle." are his greatest performances. He's a very underrated actor.
Spoiler Alert: He beats shooter McGavin
Wait so he imagines a giant spider. Lol. This is lame
I'm glad to see Sandler in something other than comedy. He's not a very funny actor.
Big props to Adam for stepping out of his comfort zone over and over again. He is such a breath of fresh air. I love the look of this.
This looks like a less fun adaptation of "Project Hail Mary"
Solo space man is to unreal even for a sci-fi, at least two people is common basic safety precaution for many jobs.
Couldn't Johan Renck cast a better actor?? Not going to tolerate this Zionist who advocates a genocide. EW!!!
Oh man I'm so hyped about this film now. Can't wait.
This is an amazing trailer. A proper teaser back to getting us to want to watch, got me hooked.
That giant spider kept activating my arachnophobia and I don't know if I will be able to get past it to watch this
Aside from the pure nightmare fuel creature , this looks like an amazing movie starring adam sandler , his acting skills are so diverse he suprises everyone
Illuminati?
Out of everything...they had to choose a hug spider????
😱
Scaryyyyy
When Sandler does more serious roles, you know it's going to be a great film.
You lost me at giant spider
The difference between Adam Sandler trying and Adam Sandler _not_ trying is gigantic!
Anyone read Children of Time?
He needs to do more serious films. Idk, maybe it's me, but his old comedy style doesn't really work anymore. Billy madison, happy gilmore, little Nicky, gems of humor. But I just stopped finding him funny as he's gotten older.
WHYYYYYY is the alien a giant spider?! Come on man. 😫
The Sandman's acting roles have been like a good bourbon, getting better and better with age.
Gotta give this movie a watch if this is going to make Adam Sandler one giant leap of a dramatic performance 🌌
I was in when I seen this Renck was attached to this but out when I had seen the "alien".  That's the best we got?
Yes, Hollywood. I’ll gladly watch Adam Sandler make out with a life sized spider. 🔥🔥🔥
This movie looks interesting. I definitely want to see this. Carey mulligan  and Adam amazing. I’m in!!!
reminds me a bit of ENEMY
Adam sandler proved he could do drama 20 years ago in Reign Over Me.  This new movie looks interesting AF.
This Adam Sandler movie looks bad, I didn't laugh once! 😮
wtf dude
leave that spiders butthole alone adam
I thought this was going to be based off of Project Hail Mary for a second. Got super excited.
Woah! I dont see adam sandler in this movie.. im so gonna watch this.
Clapping alien cheeks?
Hes great in uncut gems
i cant take this guy seriously anymore
Not to dump on Adam Sandler, but is this a movie about how an alien from outer space helps him with his marriage problems? Is that it?
Adam Sandler pushing for that Oscars again and i love it.
Although I believe in Adam Sandler's ability to deliver on dramatic roles, there is no way in hell I'm going to watch a movie with a giant hairy spider as co-star. 😬
Why did they have to use a creepy ass giant spider.
Looks pretty good actually. But I don't like the obvious problem right out of the gate. A solo flight would never happen for this exact reason.
Very odd movie. The spider sounds like the dude with the gemstone in his forehead from Avengers.
Nope nope nope. I aint watching anything with a giant spider in it.
Classic Paul Dano
Finally a fat astronaut

Chernobyl is one of the best shows I've ever seen, so a collaboration between its director (Johan Renck) and Adam Sandler should be interesting!
😮😮😮🔥🔥🤍 peak cinema .....laoding
finally adam sandler in a serous role. dont get me wrong hes funny af but hes amazing in serous roles.
Another Adam Sandler dramatic role? I'm in.
OH HELL NO! im alr in alone IN SPACE! and now there's a GIANT TALKING SPIDER IN FRONT OF ME? nope. This looks great tho, Sandler is doing AWESOMELY
Why did it have to be a spider? I hate spiders
Men that like Adam Sandler movies are loyal.
Why is the alien a spider!!
Hey new trailer of Adam Sandler Spaceman film out, lets watch. (A few moments later) %&$! that is a big spider.
They had me till the spider showed up.  My arachnophobia won't allow me to watch this.
Oh wow a Sandman movie that i actually want to watch, awesome.
Yeah, but who does Kevin James play?
Please, enough Adam. You don't have to be in movies anymore. Nobody wants that.
An Adam Sandler drama is always a win
Is it just me or when He is on the treadmill with his beard, it looks like he would play a really good Kratos for a god of war show or movie
is it part of his contracts to always wear those daggy oversized shorts in every movie?
Hoaaammm.  . . . .Another One man Lost in space Movie Again, please Stop.
Loved the trailer
awards season 2025 contenders for Best Picture, Best Director (J Renck), Best Actor (A Sandler), Best Supporting Actress (C Mulligan), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best VFX, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, Best Cast Ensemble, etc..
Hell no. What were they thinking using a spider?
Damn, I'm afraid of spiders 😅😱
Aragog Is that u 😮
Who here is from Czech Republic?
Spoiler - Adam Sandler is dead the whole time
This is what the Sandman should've been doing for the last 20 years. He is such a better actor than what he gets credit for.
Adam Sandler overload is the main reason why i cancelled Netflix.
You know...watching Adam Sandler for years and years in his comedic roles makes it hard for me to take him seriously 😂 Not that he can't be serious in these roles because he can. It's just that I'm instilled to have laughter or even smile when I see him acting in these roles 😂
Spoiler from Crewmember: He dies
Damn this looks cool
Looks like it was heavily inspired by the original Solaris. Pretty stoked.
honestly if im in space and I see a giant space spider,im using the rifle,I don´t even give a shit
I think two of Adam Sandler's best movies ever were dramas and this is already gearing up to join that list.
Ah yes...the " Nah no thanks" Alien.
Giant space spider will make this hard for me to watch without getting the hibbie-jibbies😱 BUT I'm so interested to see Adam Sandler in this role.  It looks like it will be an amazing performance from him.
This seems like something I'll forget about until I see it on Netflix next year and think, "oh yeah the trailer for that looked good" but still pick something else to watch
Beyond the Aquila Rift vibes...
Hello what is the name of song ?
So they stole the alien from "Project hail mary" and made it into an netflix movie without the good script?
Reminds me of the talking spider from Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy lol
this is gonna be a stressful movie, in a good way
wtf? lol
Ayyyyy Sandman! ❤️
Is that a spider being?
And people say he's got no range lol
"Yes, it's just another accident on station sixty-nine"
I know this is a dramatic role, but how do you resist the "Sandman is Spaceman" tagline? ❤❤❤
Sci-Fi on Netflix, is always people or a person on a ship throughout the whole movie. Maybe do a new Stargate:Atlantis or something. These Netflix Sci-fi movies are meh.
I said it before and ill say it again, Adam Sandler is amazing in dramatic roles. I wish more people knew about Reign Over me to see his range.
Low cost, high budget. Just how Sandler likes it. Loadsa $$$
Let's go, another great Adam Sandler's movie!
WHY IS IT A GIANT SPIDER???
What a wasted opportunity to have the song Spaceman by The Killers as soundtrack.
Imaginary creature??
Aragog is that you?
без негров и повестки? Не может быть нетфликс, я не верю. Но спасибо, выглядит интригующе.
spider therapy in space.  perfect.
Do Netflix have Adam Sandlers family locked up while they force him to pump out film after film
Fascinating...
Se ve interezante 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Actually looks great, looking forward to watching this one.
Oscar 💯
Adam Sandler's gonna get an Oscar (for acting) one day, mark my words.
this looks great def gonna give it a watch
So far this looks AWESOME. Can't WAIT to see it.
"From the director of Chernobyl"  So, the guy who got a whole bunch of important historical and scientific shit wrong?  Like people turning grey and their skin melting off?  Okay there... so, not expecting much from this one.
Hmmmm, just what I needed. A manic-depressive version of Project Hail Mary.
This alien creature reminds me a LOT of Arthur C Clarke's "Octospiders" from the RAMA series 👀🤔
See kids, if Billy Madison can turn it all around, get a good education and become an astronaut, then so can you!
Me thinks Adam started working towards his oscar.
What is this? Looks goofy and weird.
this kind of like that short on Love,Death & Robots where dude got lost outer space and landed where that spider looking alien
what happen to adam sandler..no more stupid joke kind of movie?
It could be worse. It could have been a giant space centipede.
He’s a spaceman, he has a rocket on his back, he’s a spaceman, the universe is down with his rave attack
Movie looks epic but that emotional support space spider threw me for a loop.
it's like the episode in Love Death Robot "beyond the Aquila rift" because of that spider.
well this had an unexpected weirdness to it.  count me in.
Why a spider man... Couldn't it be anything else? Like an octopus?
No! Just no!
Yup this is gonna make me cry
Giant spider? I’m out. Should be a good movie. But giant spider.
cartmen: ADAM SANDLER AND A SPIDER GO TO SPICE.
Looks like garbage. Hollywood has lost it
it reminds me a lot of project hail mary
It's a Netflix film. What could possibly go wrong...
He’s extremely underrated as an actor.
If Electric Callboy is not in the soundtrack im going to be mad😂
Looks absolutely awful
I think it might be Awards season next year for Adam.
When I saw the spider I thought this was some weird reimagining of Project Hail Mary
no
im so excited to watch this
Interesting
they had to make it a spider thing ....
OUURRRRR SPACEEEEMAAAANNNN THAT'S WHAAAAATTTT THEEEEY SAY I AMMMMMMM!!!!!
Your loneliness intrigued me
Absolutely not... was into it until the spider
Adam Sandler is more multi talented at acting than we give him credit for
When I saw the spider, my first thought was "Rocky, from Project Hail Mary?". I knew they were making a movie of it, just not this movie. Looks intriguing.
Why a spider though???
No Spaceman by the Killers? Shame.
This is bad as shit. Just like Brendan Fraser in that stupid whale flick. What is it with Hollywood these days?
Finally they shot Sandler to space
Hi from Czech republic!
Spiders.... Why did it have to be Spiders?
Yes. Can't wait. Our memories from set stay with us.
This looks so so similar to Project Hail Mary and it’s really irritating.
I miss Billy Maddison
Everyone with arachnophobia enjoy not watching this movie
Cannot believe Carey Mulligan is in a movie with Adam Sandler
this looks amazing
Bert kreischer annoyed adam so much he decided to undercut bert and tom and make a space movie
Jeez, for how many movies was the contract?!
OKAY, hear me out. I don't want to hate on this movie, because it looks amaizing, BUT, that red thing in the sky, and the alien... I mean, that's just screaming Andy Weir's Project Hail Mary. Still, the trailer looks awesome
I hope for a lot of fart jokes in the first 5 minutes. And some drag transformation comedy from Adam. And hopefully there are many racist jokes from Rob Schneider. Otherwise this movie would be boring and to adaulty.
I'm getting 'Moon' (2009) vibes from this for sure
Netflix movies are god awful
I'm in! Is this inspired by the short from 'Love Death and Robots"?
I will never understand Carey Mulligan is actually not Katie Holmes
I’m happy he is moving away from his awful comedy films! After proving that he has the awesome acting chops in Uncut Gems, I’m glad he’s embracing it and becoming a serious actor!
This looks thoughtful and ❤mesmerizing.
Sandler in a serious role, hmmmm. Director of Cernobyl, alright alright alright. Space Spider, fecking Nope!!!!!
Let me guess how this movie goes...something found in space, must go there, one guy only.  Isolation causes reality questions possibly a break of his mind to cope.  Most of all the happenings are in his mind. Reflections on what it is to be a human. Only later to find out that the object in space is causing this.  End scene.  No reason to watch this now.
This reminds me so much of Beyond The Aquila Rift. Its giving me goosebumps 😲😲😲😲😲
Finally a movie without a "cooperate need" of virtue signaling. ...at least in the trailer. And Adam Sandler usually is a bank when it comes to his movies, no matter in what role!
A Space Spider!!
I'm so conflicted.  On the one hand, Carey Mulligan's one of my favourite actresses, and it's always nice when Adam Sandler starts to care about making movies again.  On the other hand... that's a massive spider.
I thought this was an adaptation of Artemis by Andy Weir, that spider...
Movie looks amazing!!! Why a giant fuckin spider though????
Am I the only one creeped the heck out of that thing?
This man is brilliant. He was my childhood crush 😂
interstellar meets Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind
All this trailer did was remind that Moon was an underrated movie
someone please drop song name
Doesn't look very funny, but I will give it a try.
Adam Sandler need more drama movies. He is really good drama actor.
As a Czech, I'm slightly bitter that Netflix didn't find any Czech actor. It's kinda weird for a Czech native to have perfect English.   I realize it's probably because nobody would watch a movie with some unknown male lead. I also know that Chernobyl was an epic series even with Brits playing Soviet characters.   I'm slightly bitter nonetheless.
🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿
I said for years that Adam had INCREDIBLE potential to do more than the goofy ass comedies he was doing after he pulled out Punch Drunk Love....but holy hell!!!  I was not prepared for this new Adam we have now since Uncut Gems!!!
How nice to see a movie adaptation based on Czech book
jazz hands!
What a bunch of shit!! Exactly what Adam Sandler would say in the 90's about this shitty movie.
Isto kao i Bikovic u Ruskom filmu Izazov . Lol
is that a Australian space craft ???
This remind me of love, death, robot. "Beyond the Aquila rift"
Welp as soon as the spider showed up i lost interest. I am terrified of them lmao
I want to stand up and Clap…. I’m doing it… I’m 👏 👏👏👏👏👏
finally someone sent Adam Sandler to space.
But why a spider
Adam Sandler as an actor is like that slacker student that can actually score good grades if they feel like it.  IF they feel like it.
This looks sooo dumb cant believe people watch this garbage
Look at the Sandman getting his acting legs on point. Can't wait to see it.
"Aragogue is not a monster"
Will be a boring sad bs about the trauma of loss and grief. Nah thx
Sandler is looking to set the bar early for the 2024 film season. He’s trying to be the actor everybody has to beat this year.
lol no.
Adam Sandler in another serious role. Yes! Carrie Mulligan. Yes!   Giant spider...  Nope. This movie is a pass.
mr beast went crazy being alone for just 7 days... can you imagine 6 months?!
looked interesting until space spider showed up 😞
big bug and this trailer feel like they’re taking concepts from love, death and robots episodes, taking the concept of making movies out of it.
This dude waa floating.
Nooooo Adam it's Pennywise 🌌🛰👨🏻‍🚀🕷🕸👀😱
See, I always knew jumping spiders were pretty chill. Turns out they're good therapists too
Never listen to telepathic spiders!!!
Save me dr spaceman!!!!
THIS IS GROUND CONTROL TO MAJOR TOM - If Adam Sandler doesn't sing Space Oddity in this movie i will be very disappointed. Mr Deeds is one of my favourite movies
I can't stop laughing
The novel this is based on is really really good, I'm so looking forward to this!
Peculiar.
Why spiders, i'm really interested to see this film, but my arachnophobia can't 😅😅
Finally a movie where Adam isn't acting stupid
So does he have sex with the Alien or not?  Asking for a friend.
Spider in Space
awesom-o was right
Omg hearing Isabelle narrating in the beginning sold me. I absolutely adore her
What is the name of the song?
if u gonna send someone to 'space' send one without a pregnant wife
Wow!!😮😮😮
Is this partially inspired by the Andy Weir novel PROJECT HAIL MARY? It’s gotta be, right?
Who says Adam Sandler can't have serious roles?
Boring
Is this a parody of Gravity?
WHY THE FRICK THAT IT IS A SPIDER??????!!!!!!!!
Looks great!!
It's gonna be a Contact Alien
I really liked him in Uncut Gems, I am not so sure about this one, not because of his role in it, the story just seems dull.
No theatrical release for this? Guess I'll just be pirating it at some point.
"Do not be afraid" *Spider emerges from it's hiding spot* *I proceed to press self destruct button*
Hey Adam. Why dont you make a movie about the Gaza strip .
Come on... ATLA is earlier than that and you don't give us a trailer? Full one
it will probably flop, hes comedy
I am super confused and super excited in absolutely equal parts! xD
You know humans did bad when a spider knows better
Came into watching this trailer assuming it was going to be a spoof movie off his song Station 69 with Rob Schneider........100% the opposite lol. Still looks interesting.
Adam Sandler and his hot Wife part 9
The sandman is now a spaceman.
This film was obviously made as an attempt to get Sandler an acting award. Too bad it looks like it's crap, with that pretentious music and trendy editing. Spoiler: the spider is in his mind.
I hope it gets Czech Dub XD  If you get it? :D
Space Sandler 🪐
Let's go Netflix making their content that can't go away so smart a business decision!!  Adam Sandler still a boss!! We need a Hustle #2 or q new basketball film with Sandler he loves the game so much. Keep on rocking Netflix #1 streaming platform
Astronaut goes to space. Astronaut goes insane. The end.
He’s back baby!
I hope they use the song: Spaceman by Electric callboy
👊 Vítězství!
Station 69 the movie??
So basically this movie takes place in Australia. 🤣
What do you do when you see a space man ? You park man. 😂
Sandler and the space spider another pile of garbage from Adam
so this is Reign over me, funny people, uncut gem Sandler.
Ever since I've seen Click I knew he'd be great in serious roles
This looks so good.
Oh man I was hoping for biopic about Dr. Leo Spaceman :(
Is there an accessibility option where you turn the spider into a teddy bear otherwise I can't watch this OMG
Holy shit Paul Dano looks absolutely unrecognizable! The makeup crew really outdid themselves.
Isn't the creature and the setting the same as Project Hail Mary the book?
Space spider: "be not afraid" Me: "Sir, this is the scariest moment of my life"
Damn that acting.
wow
I know everyone keeps mentioning Uncut Gems, but can we also mention his work in The Meyerowitz Stories? This man has serious range!
This looks boring and bad. :(
The book is an absolute gold. Really looking forward to this
i guess a lot of people’s frame of reference for his dramatic roles starts at Uncut Gems. 🙃
Why did it have to be a space spider… arachnophobia
Seriously though, Adam Sandler needs to do more dramatic roles more often.
This could be very interesting 😮
I hate sci-fi movies with excessive drama like this. The effort, cost and time required to send an astronaut deep into space is extraordinary. But for some reason the people chosen for this mission are always people who are overly emotional. I miss you, I just want to go home. BOO-HOO! S*ck my a**. Just do your job, you crybaby.
20 seconds in and I am bored
Adam Sandler doing drama is always good
This looks great
adam sandler plus Netflix equals im not so sure
I love seeing Adam Sandler taking risky dramatic roles. Yeah, he's a comedian but his nuances as a dramatic actor are simply the best. This is what happens when a great director directs a good actor to tell a great story. He should do more drama roles because it's always a pleasure.
WHY MUST IT BE A SPIDER?!?!?! I CANT WATCH IT THEN. All the hairs in my neck are standing up
You see what I see
Yes, Sandler kills it when he is on more serious roles. And the theme of this movie seems very interesting, cool combo for sure
Adam finally got to wear his normal day clothing instead of Hollywood, making him wear thier clothes lol
🥱
in the end he's either crazy and he's not even in the space
Netflix please bring back old time series and movies ..... From last year you are not providing that type of content which you used to😢😢😢
Movie looks cool, why did it have to be a spider though...😟
He's Still the goofball comic. Jim Carrey has more credibility as straight man than this hack
Stop playing thats Aragog 🤪
Why did it have to be a spider 😰
He just couldn't help add some goofy ass talking spider to what could've been a super dramatic award winning movie
🥺I want to see it so bad, 🫣but I’m too afraid of spiders😩🫥
jesus. I hope this is good.
They made a movie from that Nick Jonas song 😄
Maybe the alien could’ve been better? Looks like Groot’s cousin.
Alternate title:  Adam Sandler and his emotional support spider
I'm up in space, man Up in space, man I've searched around the universe Been down some black holes There's nothing but space, man And I wanna go home
Space spider....great
did no one felt like this movie is like that episode from love death robots? where a spider give visions to the astronaut bcos the reality for him is too cruel?
WAT
Really looking forward to this movie.  To me, Adam Sandler is quite an underrated actor.  He's very versatile in his acting abilities and has been incredible in so many past roles.
I’m getting Andy Weir Project Hail Mary vibes from this.
Does he crashland on epsteins island
I wish that this movie release in theatre 😢
Did anyone else get a "LOVE DEATH AND ROBOTS" Flashback of horror when you saw the space spider? IYKYK - Horror of being stuck in space.... This looks interesting, cant wait to see it.
There has to be a mod in this movie where the spider becomes a bear....
If you told me that Adam Sandler is going to be starring as a Czech astronaut who needs a space spider to help him with feelings, I'd call you crazy. It looks fun tho. I hope it will be good.
Paul Dano voicing a giant sentient space spider is not surprising at all the man does love to play strange little guys
Meh, I've seen this before.
czech republik czcz
Well well. Adam Sandler is game on with a superior acting roll.
I already know everything about this movie just seeing the trailer.  They're mixing "Contact" with "The Fountain" and perhaps the twist from that one episode of "Love, Death, and Robots."  Pass.
Adam Sandler goes from the worst actor to the best actor every few years.
DAMN this looks good.
ty vole Cesi nemaj vlastni produkce od Netflixu tak jim to musel natocit Sandler
Love, Death, and Robots: "Beyond the Aquila Rift"
Sandler has always been a versatile actor for me ever since i saw Reign Over Me
wasn't this in Love Death and Robots
soundtrack name?
This seems dark, I'm curious to see where this story takes us. Can't wait!
That actually looks really great
looks awesome but jesus netflix movies are all so visually boring. idk if its the color grading or camera lens but yeesh
What about the GAINT TALKING SPIDER!!??
gosh dang adam
Why spiders? Why couldn't it have been follow the butterflies?
Nooooo!  Why does it have to be a spider?
Wow, its giving a serios Children of Time vibes.
People like oh hey look Adam Sandler oh hey look a gigantic spider nope
Seriously are we talking about Adam Sandler? LOL...
I thought this was gonna be a HARDWELL documentary ❤️🎧🔥
weird but it's cool when a trailer makes you feel like that. Like you're seeing the big surprise someone was hiding
The alien must be fat to call Adam a skinny human. Love his dramatic roles though.
Yay
Aww man, why did have to be a spider. Arachnophobia will prevent me from enjoying this show
Everyone else saw the space spider right? No way a apex predator is there to help some guy figure out his emotional baggage
i hope he's a dr spaceman
This is going to be epic
Whats that song in the background?
Adam Sandler is about as funny as ass cancer.
Please be like Interstellar
Czech button —->
He was amazing in Reign Over Me. I’m very curious to see him in another serious role. It’s such an untapped genre for him. I’d love to see him do it more often.
High amounts of cringe detected.
This reminds me of Project Hail Mary
Spoiler warning!!!! . . I'm going to ruin the plot for this now... Never Ever trust a spider,  their niceness is a cover for their plan to eat you
This has “Enemy” vibes, madness and spiders.
Interesting :)
they could have used the spaceman song from eurovision
..."We have Project Hail-Mary at home!"
Why does every funny man have to do this ? Depressing movies ?
Beware might (and most probably) will be very cringe.
I hope there is going to be some current agenda
Wait, does this rip off of Andy Weir’s book Hail Mary? That alien spider thing is straight out of the book.
Nothing better for theraphy than HUGE talking spider in space... Definitely not an hacky motive.
Adult Donnie Darko in Space.
I dont want to watch this
niiiiiiice!
Omg. Looks so bad. Finally time to pull the plug on this streaming subscription. Netflix; you dont get space scifi!
How odd i had a dream a few nights ago about seeing Adam Sandler in a space movie but I hadn’t even seen this trailer or knew about it until now
It's a hard no from me.
Can't wait.
I just wish they made a little bit of effort to pronounce the names correctly when him being born in Czechoslovakia during communism is a big part of the story. I was not expecting an actor like Sandler to try to imitate Czech accent but it's always nice when actors at least try.
Happy for Adam, but tired of space stories where astronauts go crazy.
In the end- he ain’t in space - but all is going in his head or hes dying/hospitalized…..  that’s the suspense of it!
Woah Johan Renck
He discovers an alternate Happy Gilmore in another dimension 😆
In real life a spaceman with that kind of mission are not allowed to have wives.
Oi
Thank you very much  N  (( do what ever u like but don't harm any one  )) 🥰💕⚘️
Arachnophobia 200%
feels like Project Hail Mary a bit no?
Whoa
Looks interesting enough for me to watch and form my own opinion about it.
czech republic mentioned???? wtf is emotional stability???💙❤🤍
Dang... that big spider is unsettling.
Lol I thought I saw "superman trailer"
Adam Sandler, AND giant spiders?! one risk wasn't enough Netflix ?
I don’t know if it’s the beard or the name of the series, but I was really confident the the track for this trailer was going to be performed by Sam Ryder.
What? No funny voice?
Carey Mulligan finally using her real accent lol
How do you think of something like this and not make it a Space Force spin-,off
You got me at Carey Mulligan. I will watch a dishevelled dishrag drying in the sun if it starred her in it. I will definitely be watching. Paul Dano and Isabella Rossellini are icing on top of the cake. Not normally an Adam Sandler fan, to be honest I've not even watched 1/3 of his film catalogue because I don't like his stupid brand of moronic comedy, but I have enjoyed films where he has been cast outside of his normal schtick like Punch Drunk Love or Uncut Gems. Hopefully this is one of them.
Space station: you been gone for 6 months and your family awaiting you at home Me: f*ck, can't escape them even when I go to space?? Sign me up for another year will ya?
where is the fart's joke???
I think constant visits with people you think you know is unatural , i view that like psyvology views isolation, after all we have memory so that we can thrive IE what you can eat,  poisonous plants ect,  if you had continual negativity or violence from people,  you would not go against vself preservation, you would protect.  Seriously,  do you really know your partner? I didn't.  That's decades same person,  look at ot from my POV
y la mujer hermosa que se enamora de el?
Sweet, love that he's been able to show his range. Like Robin Williams, cut for comedy, drama, suspense, thrill, action and horror...whatever comes his way. Can't wait to check this one out.
Thanks for this risky project
Kinda Project Hail Mary vibes
Adam Sandler and Alien Spiders, I’m in. 👽
This looks like an impressive performance by Adam Sandler just like when he did Uncut Gems
Looks very interesting. But living in a spaceship with a big hairy arse spider? Sod that.
Jesus Carey Mulligan is everywhere - working hard this year lol
Paul Dano
I wonder if they’ll keep the same ending???
This looks Great 😊
Adam Sandler y dramas existenciales promete bastante.
Do you know that the Central Communication Building was demolished recently? But as Czech citizen, it´s really nice to know about sci-fi movie about Czech astronaut. I´m really excited.
DANO NATION RISE UP!!!
Welp, unlock a new nightmare stew for me, alone in a space craft for months and a 200 pound spider appears and starts talking.
I was expecting zany alien and human hijinks, not therapy in space. I'm extremely intrigued.
Yea, but why a spider doe? 🤮
🇨🇿
Finally! A documentary about the greatest medical practitioner in the past 50 years! Oh wait...this isn't a documentary about Dr. Leo Spaceman? My bad!
Everyone talking about uncut gems pretending like clicks ending wasn’t the saddest
Zack Synder cannot make even this type of movie. He really needs to learn what filmmaking is.
This will be either: Great or Horrible.
I just don’t understand why some of these scfi films frequently send just 1 astronaut on a space mission ?🤔  Seems like a terrible idea psychologically speaking 🤦🏻‍♂️
why would I waste my time watching a movie with Adam Sandler
Maybe Sandler is a good fit to play Ryland Grace for the Project Hai Mary
A movie is always a gem with adam sandler in it.
an emotional telepathic space spider?! IM IN
first
This is why people shouldn't go to space 😂
I love how Adam Sandler, after years of making low brow comedies to set him and his friends for life, started to show others his actual acting skill
Just wondering why some of these scifi films frequently send just 1 astronaut on a space mission? 🤔 Seems like a terrible idea from a psychological perspective 🤦🏻‍♂️
Gooood creepy looking spider
Stakka Bo directed this . People who know, they know. "Here we go again".
Why is that spider the size of a dinner plate
This looks dumb, sorry but it does
Ok i mostly know Adam Sandler in Comedy Movies but seeing him in a different kind of movie is really a cherry on top and this movie could be really good. Finally 2024 is looking up for Hollywood
I like to think adam sandler is set for life so hes now just doing drama roles for fun
The jellyfish ufo?!?! In a Hollywood movie already??? Hahaa   Seriously can’t wait for this.  Sandler kills serious roles almost always
When I see Adam Sandler, i just click.
Spiders from Mars anyone?
Mom: We have Ad Astra at home  The Ad Astra at home:
When I saw the spider I literally shot up in my chair with excitement thinking this was a project Hail Mary movie, but regardless I’m very excited
Had to be a giant spider huh? I woulda watched if you’d picked anything else!
Everyone’s out here talking about how great a dramatic Sandler is like we didn’t just see a giant telepathic space-nope…
Man, I hate when Sandler movies make me cry
That little voice that comes out of know where when you just don’t know wtf anymore…
adam sandler is great actor..this movie will be incredible.
man and his spider.
You have no idea how amazing a movie can be when the star is a comedian and he’s actually serious in the role!
Can we collectively just stop with using the "alone in space" trope. Unless the other parties, in all likelihood at least two others, died during the mission this situation makes no sense. No space agency would ever send a singular person into space on a lond duration mission. Everything else looks interesting though.
Now the question is... Will Netflix change the ending of the book, because it doesn't exactly have a happy ending.
arachnophobia mode on
comedia? o alucinaciones? como que no se define bien.
this went from generic scifi trailer to interesting concept pretty quickly. hope it turns out to be good
Simply brilliant.......
New spiderman variant
Well, the book is interesting, let's see the movie)))
Why does this song sound familiar who knows what it is??
Sure why not
As often the case, comedy actors are amazing at drama.
To vypadá skvěle!
I wish they did this movie with Jim Carrey instead. But he's not fashionable anymore.
nobody is talking about the trailer or the giant spider... just Adam Sandler not doing a comedic role. Happy for him, but THE TRAILER!? We all just okay with a giant spider somehow getting onto the ship? Coping mechanism? Like what are yalls thoughts fr
Feels weird that it's not a comedy
I am almost entirely certain that there will be an Adam Sandler x Weird Spider sex scene and I'm all for it.
That Spider CGI looks great.
In the end the spider eats his brain and takes over for him
I'm gonna watch, this looks so different from anything I'VE seen him in and I'm excited to see his acting skills stretched💙💛💙💛
This makes me think of rocketman the song
Director of Chernobyl? It is gonna be alright!!!!
I love sci-fi and I love Adam Sandler but this movie looks terrible
This could be good. I liked Chernobyl a lot.
This movie definitely got me curious and wanting to check this out which is what a trailer is supposed to do
An-Naml is the 27th chapter of the Qur'an with 93 verses. Regarding the timing and contextual background of the supposed revelation, it is an earlier "Meccan surah", which means it is believed to have been revealed in Mecca, rather than later in Medina.
March 1st? From now until then there's too much SPACE, MAN!!!
adam sandler gona be astronaut on the netflix movie 2024
Either this is gonna be real shit or real good, there's no middle ground for this man.
I would’ve driven that spaceship to the sun once I seen that big ass spider
yes
Reminds me of Children of Time
This movie Trippy u gotta smoke to this lol
to go from Jack & Jill to Uncut Gems, Adam Sandler is someone you should never underestimate.
You know, after his “Space Station 69” song in his Netflix show, I had really imagined “Spaceman” being a very different movie… But I’m not complaining 😄
Usually, Adam Sander plays a lot for silly roles. But this one looks interesting and different.
If it's anything like interstellar that means the spider is his daughter from the future and he's spending time with her from the past. Great concept, good movie
Wtf is this big spider 😱
Every like this comment get i will do a push up nonestop
You can't go wrong with an Adam Sandler Movie, i will be there.
Multiverse where Sandler found Spiderman.
I'll watch this because of Adam Sandler but that big spider alien is really going to freak me out though but here's to hoping this'll be a good movie.
Swing and a miss again Sandler... smh
If I got a dime every time there is a major movie about a lone space traveller allegedly communicating with alien spider-like creature, I would have two dimes, which isn't a lot, but it's weird it happened twice.
Reminds me of the movie, The fountain
Voltando assistindo agora com as vozes em meu idioma o português brasileiro e top ouvir Adam Sandler em português
Adam Sandler... IN SPAAAAACE!
Looks amazing! Can't wait.
I cant help but imagine Adam Sandler singing "I am a space man" in his high pitched maestro voice
Amazing to see the opportunity streaming services are giving to talented actors like Adam Sandler. Seems a solid deal he's got "1 award winning drama for every 2 comedies". Keep them coming Sandflix.
this 30 Rock spinoff is weird
AWWW HELL NO!!!!! I am not gonna be able to watch this with that horrible creature!!!
arachnophobes are gonna miss out big time with this one unless they release an arachnophobe-friendly version
Feels like beyond the aquila rift. same vibe
Drama role Sandler is the best Sandler.
the put a spider in the movie half the people will be scare watching this lululul.
looks like Sandler is going for a performance combination of Tom Hanks in "Apollo 13" and Sandra Bullock in "Gravaty" 2 thumbs way way up for that 👍👍
I understand this is a Netflix produced movie, but the giant "NETFLIX" watermark is a bit much.
Looks bad to bad it’s not funny  because then It had a chance
похуй. через недельку скачаю на торренте в русской озвучке
Stuck in 	a small spacestation with a giant spider. Oh hell noooo!!!
i wanna watch this but im not watching a movie with a big ass scary talking spider
Why do they keep casting people as Husband and wife who have stupid age gaps? Sandler is 57, Mulligan 38. Ridiculous.
Looks good I like Sandler drama roles
Calling it now. This is going to be BS
Loving that the spider from Enemy finally gets some more work.
You could have chosen a lot of things to be the creature, but a Spider. My scary will never get to see this movie
is the ending going to be it was all in his head the entire time?
Ah, super disappointment it wasn't a "normal" Adam Sandler film, his movies are mostly good family fun.... I bet the Spider eats him in the end!
Should've called it Spider/Man and put it in theaters.    There would be a lot of confused people who thought it was a different movie they were going to see, but it would still make a billion dollars.
Wait, did they rip off Project Hail Mary to make this? Interstellar mission, Space spider, Lonely Astronaut… And if they did rip off PHM, why? The tone is completely different here, you could do your own thing with it easily
Why is it always spiders? Why can’t it be space butterflies?
I was actually excited to see this.... Until the spider... Now it's unwatchable for me.
oh hey a Adam Netflix movie that actually looks like it's budget that pays for actual production and not just mostly him with 6 talented friends and Kevin James.
Adam Sandler has entered his sci-fi era!
Spoiler alert - he has sex with the spider.
I have a feeling that this movie gonna be either 1/10 or 10/10
Woah, this looks like people who are taking some chances. I'm looking forward to this weirdness
This seems like it would be a way better experience in theaters.
y they have to make it a giant spider. now I can't watch it
I really, really hate spiders.  So no, interesting movie, I will not be seeing you.  I'm sure there's some reason they choose to make the creature/thing a giant spider (like its another fear of the character, which I completely understand), but I'm just so annoyed.
в космосе первый человек - это адам сендлер
I feel like it's gonna be a banger
Please don't end up being that "You never went to space, you were never a spaceman, and you're imagining all this to hide yourself from the truth" stuff, that story formula got old, I had enough of those
Spaceman turned spiderman
Adam's back has to hurt from carrying Netflix lately.
This seems like it was based off of the book Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir. Anyway, will definitely be tuning in!
I think I speak for everyone here by saying; "hmmmmm".
Omgggg finally some American film about my country yeeeeey🫢❤️
love death + robot but not in 3D, ,😬😬😱😱
Looks great
I feel like its easier for comedic actors to crossover to drama....vs dramatic actors trying to be funny.
At last another real job for him. I hate him like comedian, but I love him like drama actor.
its nice to see a friendly alien for a change
I see Johan Renk's name, I Like
Yes. More R-Rated Science Fiction please! The trailer is thought-provoking, doesn't reveal too much and looks aesthetically beautiful. I applaud Netflix for supporting talented directors and actors with their productions, instead of the mind-numbing content that typically floods its platform. Keep it up :)
space is BS
When Adam Sandler does drama, he's REALLY good at it. I expect this to be another top notch film.
Adam Sandler as an astronaut!?! Bahahahahaha So believable...
Even though the movie couald end up not being that good, Adam Sandler's performance is gonna be awesome.
Uncut Gems was fantastic. Now this one . Hoping for the best.
Do neida Adam Sandler fazendo outro filme sério 😅
Oh good, no whacky voices
Any arachnophob in the room 🖐️
I want the Silent Sea season 2 please 🙏 😢 😭
The alien sounds G4Y 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
YES Adam Sandler in film inspirate by Czech book Its gonna be fire🔥
The alien he’s talking to sounds like Vision from the avengers lol
omg Mr sandler get a new job
Im not a drama fan but im watching this cuz my boy adam
mysterious creature that looks like an ordinary earthly spider - God, how boring, the creators are not at all interested in inventing something a little UNUSUAL?
This feels alot like Andy Weir - Hail Mary
How did Adam Sandler go from Comedy to Drama roles?
0:40 Chernobyl was impressive. Can’t wait 🤙
This oddly feels like an adaptation of Children of Time .
I won’t be able to watch this , it looks fantastic but I can’t
I was super excited to see this, and then *boom*, alien space spider.    I feel like they're all over me.
If it's a spider because his wife died of a spider bite before/after he left will be stupid.
Damn, this looks very promising. Amazing.
Adam Sandler? He still get Work?
I wonder what Adam would think if he could see this trailer waaay back when he was a walk-on guest on MTV's Remote Control...
Script was wrote during the pandemic, with 3 actors.
Ini tentang penelitian luar angkasa, seorang pria meninggalkan istri nya yang lagi mengandung demi penelitian luar angkasa
Adam Sander actually looks good in this role. I really had to stop watching his comedy movies as they got dry. This looks really solid, honestly.
So, that looks pretty good, but the idea of being stuck in a spaceship, alone, with a massive spider roaming around - real or not - is a bit much. Sandler does do pretty well in dramatic roles, but again, spider.   Sorry, all I can think is... SPIDER!
I am so happy as a Czech person to see a movie version of this unique czech book. Cannot wait!
Love to see a Czech author get adapted into a major film like this. Shoutout Jaroslav Kalfař 🇨🇿🇨🇿🇨🇿
Czech spaceman... 6 months without beer, of course he is depressed!
cinema is back on the menu, boys.
Damn i normally have been disappointed in his recent films but this one actually looks good
It has a giant spider in it... ok ill watch it
Looks fascinating and well done, but what if you have arachnaphobia?
A giant spider 😂 creepy
Is he the voice of Leo?
This kind of reminds me of a book I read recently. It’s called „Project Hail Mary“ written by Andy Weir who also wrote „The Martain“. Highly recommend reading this book. It has a similar vibe but it‘s not what you‘d expect.
If it turns out aliens are big spiders I will KMS 😊
Why did it have to be a spider? 😭😭
I am getting a lot of Project Hail Mary vibes from this.
I saw him in Reign Over Me, he`ll knock this one out of the park.
I never imagined a terrormorph would end up being a therapist to a man going insane.
The music has a theme from chopin nocturne and then Beethoven moonlight😂
Outer Limits episode
It's time for Adam Sandler to stop making movies...
An Adam Sandler movie I can watch
ok, this looks interesting..
Everytime Adam does a non-comedy expect that it'll be good.
Comedians always do great whenever they do drama roles
Intergalactic telepathic Spidres might be the new dem dem mushi Snail transponder, as long as it doesnt try to eat you!
This have an Oscar nomination for Adam written ALL OVER this.
This better not be another disguised cloverfield POS
Man Adam Sandler as a writer and creative influence... The man writes himself a bestselller comedy sereis and now takes his creative authenticity and autonomy with him wherever he goes in the film industry! When you realise that only he could play the role of such a story you think about how far he's come. Also this is a cool persepctive on space travel. Should our spaceships have tree's, telepathic spiders and stuff?
He directs or just act ?  I hope just act  He is a good actor  But a terrible terrible director ( writer Too )
OH C´MON BRO NOT SPIDERS AHHHHHHHHHHH
i don't have arachnophobia or anything but if i see that i might develop arachnophobia.
Looks good
I love Adam but you lost me at giant hairy spider, hell no
I thought people were kidding when they said there will be Adam Sandler Space movie lol...
Mark my words now, it'll be his first academy award nomination <3
Adam Sandlrer got a his New Prime
ok... but why a spider? could we not have landed on a turtle or maybe even a squirrel?... I am willing to meet you in the middle and go octopus...
WOW 👍👍👍
oh hell no we aint normalizing interfacing with weaver spirits !
I'm sure its a unpopular opinion but I really dont get why Adam sadler comedies are so popular. This guy clearly was meant for more than 12 year old humor.
When I saw the being I thought this was the adaptation of Andy Weir Hail Mary. Then I realized they just ripped him off.
so it's Solaris then?
march? if you can release the trailer today, you can release the movie today. stop making people wait for absolutely no reason.
Adam Sandler ran outta vacation spots on earth
PAUL DANO!!
I hope this film does well. I know Sandler has the acting chops to pull off drama after seeing Reign over Me. I hope to see more of that.
It's nice to see my country is used in this movie ❤
A spider is talking to him? I'm out, I guess...
This looks sick.. Netflix releasing quality stuff this year!
I'm getting "Solaris" vibes from this.
POLICE I SWEAR TO GOD-
This looks so weird, but quite interesting.
Did it REALLY need to be a spider?!? It couldn't be a bee or a badger?!
Out of all of the movies coming out this year, this is the one that's the highest on my hope it's great list, because almost everything I've seen in this trailer makes me excited. The camera movements, the effects, the colors, the spider, the music, even the acting. Adam Sandler, Isabela Rossellini, Carey Mulligan, and Paul Dano? I'd buy that for a dollar!
Adam Sandler is awesome but this movie not so much
One  small step of a man is a giant leap for mankind
so many bots here talking about adam, but not a single one asking why the alien is a spider
I'm so confused and I like it!
Is that Little Nicky in space?
Seems something new n fresh idea
Finally they did - the mayor tom movie - hoping for the  classic songs, rocket man, space oddity and mayor tom, plus starman , and the last one from bowie
I hoped against hope that this was a "Dr. Spaceman from 30 Rock" movie. But this seems good too.
Why Sandler tho...
Bruh why does it have to be a spider 🥲
The age of sandler begins again
i was sold on this until the spider showed up. No thank you, I'm gonna have to pass
Adam Sandler playing again a serious movie role. I'm all in for it!
Why not send an astronaut who hasn't got a pregnant wife or any family member that requires regular attention to do the mission? Problem solved.
cant wait for the alien to be kevin james
Adam sandler 👏🏼 Carey mulligan 👏🏼 alien spiders 👏🏼
From the director of Chenoybl, I am 100% in!!!!
Since NOTHING Adam Sandler EVER does is bad, this will be GREAT! I can't wait!
I will watch this as I am impressed with Adam's serious roles.... however, A spider though?  His subconscious, maybe, projects a talking spider?.... This is bringing Shelob nightmares back...lol
Unfortunately, I have big time arachnophobia, so I won't be watching. But this does look interesting.
Punch Drunk Love, Spanglish, Reign Over Me, Uncut Gems, The Meyerowitz Stories, Hustle and now Spaceman...love when he does relatively serious roles.
'Do not be afraid' I would shit myself and pass out if I saw that
I heard this was complete shit
Looks like another movie that coulda been good but netflix came along and screwed it up
Will watch immediately on release!
Making the alien a spider was a bold choice. Let's see if it pays off.  I'm an arachnophobe so this will need to be spectacular to justify that design choice.
What a lot of people fail to realize is that most comedians have range when it comes to acting
Oh my I can't watch this, this is just worst that any horror movie but its also Adam Sandler, I'm immensely conflicted.
Spanglish is another good non comedy Sandler movie.
hopefully this will be good, since he certainly isn't funny
Damn now i wanna know if the spider is actually real or not.
Adam Sandler dresses in space the same way he dresses in real life
Shut up and take my money! Oh yeah...Netflix already has my money.
Solaris vibes
Adam Sandler rules! Love his movies.
Did none of y’all see that spider thing? Nope. No. Nooo. No. Nope.
This looks amazing, hope they do a good job
who took the pile of acid i left on the table
you know Adam is serious when he has that beard
why did it have to me a spider i was looking forward to watching this
Really??!! It had to be a damn spider!!?? I'm done. I wanted to see it but now my arachnophobia kicked in. HUGE PASS 😒
i have huge obession with space
A space spider....
if its 90min long it will be amazing if it's 200min long it will be awful
I checked out when I saw the 3-foot spider...
On the one hand, this looks good. On the other hand, the arachnophobe in me keeps covering his eyes every time he sees that giant spider (I know it's not actually a spider, but it looks like one).
Hold on, is there really a film featuring Adam Sandler that's genuinely serious?
I would jump out the instant I see a huge ass spider telling me Don't be Afraid.   NO
We have evolved from Eggman to Spaceman!
I really love Adam Sandler's underrated great dramatic chops but adding Carey Mulligan in this picture is fantastic!   Now this is something to look forward ❤
He should have done Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir
As a millennial Adam will always have a special place in my heart. Not only has he always seemed like one of the most chill and down to earth celebrities, but From Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, Waterboy, Longest Yard, etc etc, he was our childhood and I'll watch anything he does
IS THIS AN ADULT SPACE CHARLOTTE'S WEB?
The list is coming for Sandler.
Great choice at picking a giant goddamn spider to be the friendly alien. Really make the audience have to overcome their revulsion of giant spiders.
lets be honest whatever u thought this trailer was gonna be...it wasnt this
O SNAP A SERIOUS ADAM SANDLER MOVIE
Adam Sandler following the path of the Mcconaissance and I absoultely love it!
I'm gonna be disappointed if this doesn't have Rob Schneider in it.
I love spiders, so I'm in.
whoah
I will skip this and wait for Adam spider
It looks good. I hope it is.
They could have made any creature they wanted and they decided to make a giant spider xD
Netflix actually makes such good shows n movies
I get vibes of : French experimental movie, on mushrooms, with Adam Sandler
Prometheus is the best space/alien movie in existence. This looks like trash
Isabella ….. LFG !!!
why the f**k did it have to be a spider
People forget he's actually an amazing actor, it's just acting like an idiot doing comedy movies pays very well. There's a reason his net worth is almost $500,000,000 his comedy movies pay off very well.
i want it to be about exploration of the alien species not the HIS RELATIONSHIP and MISSING HIS WIFE   SIGH
👍👍👍👍
Still hoping that You don’t mess with Zohan 2 is on the way.
Another Adam Sandler masterclass
NETFLIX Scifi Space Movies and Series are Always so an EPIC like Don't Look Up Movie and Lost in Space Serie. This Spaceman looks so an AMAZING, Can't Wait for March 1 i'm so HYPED! Netflix is a Star. 🌠
ah mas que merda, eu vi ele achei que ia ser comedia pra gente mas é um drama, triste
Adam Sandler is great person ... He is underrated..he deserves more... Is creates happiness into peoples hearts.
I love when Adam Sandler does dramatic roles.  This looks great!
Adam Sandler proved with his performance in Punch Drunk Love that he is fully capable of taking on dramatic roles. This looks to be no exception.
Adam with Czech republic flag? whaaaaaat? and Lenka?
when adam sandler play in a serious drama film it always become masterpiece
OH LORD THAT NEEDS AN ARACHNOPHOBIA WARNING.
I feel VERY bad for all the arachnophobics who watched this trailer expecting a simple space story. 🫣
Depressive. No, thank you.
If Paul Dano is playing "an ancient creature from the beginning of time" in the movie, then I'm going to see the movie, folks
after watching uncut gems its impossible to underestimate adam sandlers acting.
i love the Adam Sandler classic comedys, but im so excited to see what more Sandler is bringing. he always continues to surprise me ever since he did Uncut Gems
What the hell did I just watch and what's the plot? I wish I could say this makes it more appealing to me but I was hoping it'd be more than emotions and a spider. Maybe the trailer just isn't showing enough. I will watch regardless because it's Adam Sandler.
this looks absolutely amazing.
For a moment in the trailer. I thought he going to have sex with a space spider. Phew, " I might be of help " is mentally help
They turned Paul Dano into a spider
Was waiting for the Babylon Zoo track to kick in 😢
Moon is better anyways
i hope at the end they play Spaceman by Hardwell
Whats wrong with these people, showing the whole plot in a trailer.
wtf
This looks pretty interesting I will admit
Okay I’m a little upset that as soon as I saw the Spider I thought of Rocky from Project Hail Mary.
This feels like a strange mix of Project Hail Mary and Solaris lol
Can't wait
Avatar the last airbender
I love Adam Sandler. I'll watch literally anything. lol There's some stuff I've only watched once, but there's many Adam Sandler films I watch multiple times a year. I think he's great!
If Uncut Gems taught me anything, it’s that Adam Sandler can do a great job in dramatic roles
My Octopus Teacher
@netflix you and the spaceman are not alone in the space ❤
Looks neat
Looks almost like the book "Hail Mary" from isolation to the multi legged creature.
Is it me or does this look like that one love death and robots  episode
Looks like a rip off to project hail Mary
This looks amazing. It's a Adam Sandler movie it should be.
There are very few movies Adam Sandler is in that I’ve enjoyed however this looks intriguing and I would like to see him in more dramatic roles instead of stupid, goofball comedies
He will actor wins awards that's so good speech but he's good acting.
After uncut gems I will never underestimate anything this man does.
Amazing! Adam Sandler is  perfect for this role!
Comedy or Pure Drama Role? Either one is fine with Sandler
People thought all Adam Sandler could do was crappy comedies and now he is about to hit the world with a hat-trick of epic performances
Me (a big sci fi fan) : loving what I am seeing!  Me( an arachnophobia) : SSSPIDDDDEERRRR!!!!
A spider.  We’ll, that’s me not watching it then 😂😱
Yeah. You want. And you won't. This isn't hollywood. This is netflix. You will d@e.
Sandler space spider
Ain't no fckin way I'd be able to sit through this with that creepy ssa spider walking around...
oh no not again a floating potatoe
I'm just gonna say it. Adam has been amazing lately.  From the comedies like the kid movie and murder mystery. Motivational movies like the true stories like his basketball movie.  And now this! I'm so glad were back in a Adam Sandler reianssance
Sandman’s bout to churn out another banger. Can’t wait!! Streams on the same day DUNE: PART TWO opens in theaters. Gonna be an amazing way to kick off the month of March!! Sci-fi fans definitely gonna be eating good.
🤩 Wow, I have to see that film
Looks promising Adams been on a run here lately 🔥
Adam Sandler is underrated in drama roles. He knocked it out of the park with uncut gems like Jim Carry did in the Truman Show. The funniest people on the planet live in the darkest corners. I'm excited to see Sandler in a serious role again. I'm happy for him.
Usual people will get scared of huge spiders, that too in space
Adam Sandler in a non-comedy no nonsense role, this should be fun
Oh im so fking ready! Love anything involving space ! Altough when i read Paul Dano was gonna play an alien i did not expect said alien to be A GIANT FKING SPIDER
All this just to be on Netflix and not in Theaters? Such a waste of
Words can't describe how much I love Adam Sandler
🥰
spaceman from Czechia..........interesting☺
Oh my God I’m so pumped for this
When is the Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F official trailer coming out
yo this looks incredible!!!!
People really underrate Adam Sandler’s range and he always take it personal and show us why we shouldn’t sleep on him. This is gonna be a good movie I can’t wait 💯
Why of course I want to watch a movie with a oversized spider in it. I’m sure I won’t have nightmares for the rest of my life.
To be honest, I was kinda hoping for a Babylon Zoo documentary...
Adam Sandler on more serious roles ? hell yeah.
Wtf he is a comedy actor !!!!!
First Adam sandler movie in 2024 i hope it hit us🔥
😮 this looks good and serious....great job Water Boy 🥤
This is still a better buzz lightyear  movie
Ever since the ridiculous 6 when Adam Sandler first signed on to do Netflix films he has definitely changed his movie roles and it's great to see him do other films besides straight up comedies
waterboiy to seriousman. i am in!
Adam sandler in a space movie this gonna be fire🔥
Still can't believe Adam made a movie thats story comes from Czech Republic 🇨🇿🇨🇿 ❤❤
The first teaser is interesting, but this trailer just gives it all away
I hope this is turns out to be a good movie, I'm always looking forward to see Adam Sandler getting cast against type in a non comedy role. Adding Carey Mulligan in the mix as part of the cast increases my interest
looks fantastic.
So will it end with this all being in his head/a dream?
Can already guess the Rotten Tomatoes scores for this one. Critics: 15%, Audiences: 90%
Best🫰🫰
Awesome! Can’t wait.
Adam Sandler is far away from Lunchlady Land in this one
Reminds me of the episode of Love Death + Robots, great idea. Looks beautiful.
When will u upload avatar trailer
Uncut gems , hustle and now this Adam Sandler is on fire lately
My fart smell like Adam sandler.
.
Wait.  So Adam Sandler is in a sci-fi space drama called Spaceman on Netflix?  I always love it when a comedian steps out of their comfort zone like that. Plus I’ll watch anything involving interstellar travel.
What about having fun in a movie for once ????
🎉
