Omnipotent should be Protean and Adaptability combined to also reference Eevee
I would’ve called it ultieon
Pls make a fusion of the new eeveeloutions
name godeon for god power
The fact that his Mega Dragonite idea is on point with what mega dragonite actually looks like is crazy
Ultraeon
Could have used the moveset of calm mind,psychic, moonblast and flamethrower
12:49 the moment that you think you still can win  12:58 THE FUNNIEST FAIL I'VE EVER SEEN!!! 😂 But still this video was amazing, United, and im proud of you and Gabriel for making this happen
FACT: Scald got reintroduced as a TM in the Teal Mask DLC. You're welcome for me breaking your "Scald is OMNIPOTENT" vibes. ;D  Also, you lost a battle with a 130 all stat Pokemon because your attacks are all resisted by Dragon-types. *facepalm* I would have given it all attacking moves in Dazzling Gleam, Dark Pulse, Leaf Blade and Liquidation. ;p

6:36 lot twisted: penny is in the crowd
Kaysley 😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😊😊😊😊❤😊❤😊❤😊
I think for set up move you should give him no retreat
He should have brought freeze-dry instead of thunderbolt because it covers more then thunderbolt and he would have won against dragapult
Amazing Video🤩😮🤯😂🥺😊❤️
how can you add your pokemon in the game, I need to know please
Omneon has been registered to your Pokédex
Ok but actually i dont care what your excuse is, omneon is my favorite out of the many eeveelution fusions ive seen. (Of which ive only seen 3 others but i digress)
Everyone is just going so crazy about this well I'm really calm
I just subscribed I'm so happy about it🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
I think another Pokemon should be named every time😅😅😅😅😅😅 sorry my device doesn't understand that
Was that pokeball poker tips
I thought it could have had a better name
$$$$$$ Hello what is going on on that on my screen😢😢😢😢😢
That's not cool, that's cruel fusing them all.
If you ever do a dual type eveelutions video and make a dark ghost type, a good name idea would be umbreon
8:51 I like omneon it's kinda like a super eevee/eevee god/legendary eevee? An eevee with all stats and abilities of the eeveelutions
Repent ya'll because god loves ya and you should love him back ✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️☦✝️✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦☦✝️✝️✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️☦✝️
You should fuse the new Eevee's together
I think you could have said megaeon
animay
Infineon
I HAVE AN ACTUAL FUSION CARD IN MY FIRST EVER CARD SET NAMED OMNEON!!!! WOAH-
Eevee with sonic 06 music? is it going to be a buggy mess?
Ussopp he is a god
Am I the only one that noticed that the other pokemon were named after the people from The Office?😂
I loce how you went with the omni ability chain (most powerful abilities) and went with the science name 🙂
Can you fused the Reggie’s together
I would just call it “Eeveeon”😂
Just sit.
Tbh i would have called smth with chimera since its a mythological creature with a different attributes from different animals (scorpion tail,goat horn, some animal wings, face and body of a lion....) hmmm tho chimereon doesnt sound good so nvm
I would have named it evee squared
Bro predicted Stellar type before it happened
I think the name Ultreon would have been a better name. Ultreon: Ultra meaning extremis and Eon for Eeveelution. Will how broken this custom Pokémon is I can’t think of a better name than ULTREON.
Eevee is fucking baller.
You should call Omneon The doneon(the don is the GOAT)
Gabriel, no offence, but I would’ve chose the name supremeon
Bro  ultamatoin literally ultimate Pokémon
ngl i would use a glowing like fur and fluff thats white, and black sclera and white pupils and waving tails. if theres a remodel and add a tail with stars making the eveluttions and the tip would be the color of evee
People who thought it should have been named omniman👇
I hav it it troo
omeon is a pokemon card 😓😓😭😭🥱🥱🤬🤬
This looks like a the final bosses for a quest line in a jrpg. I can imagine in the next Legends game at the start your given this quest but you can't compete it Lel the end of the game as a secret boss!
I’m the literall biggest Eevee ever!!!
**penny wants your phone number**
Mega eeveelotiond is needed
hey Dylan I had this amazing idea for a new mega video for a different mega Umbreon it's similar to blood moon ursaluna but because of the blood moon the cast of an illusion was put on it that it's alone and the spirits of its siblings (aka all the eeveloutions) they guide his dead spirit back to life making him ghost dark because of his ancestors either that or ghost dragon since they're elemental
I would call it Typeon
Amalgeon. Root wood = amalgamation.
Multieon for multiple
❤
Omneon is great, but it could also have been Ulteon, for the ultimate eeveelution
I am just gonna call it ultiveon
Now pls do every pika-clone
I guess even with all the best stats Eevee is still mid
Garchop
hi
4:36 I feel like it should be fuseon
Rob says it’s cute
I would call it rulleon because it rules over all the evelutions
I can’t believe it’s stronger than arceus
I think another possible name could have been Adapteon, because it *adapts* into different types.
Congrats you got 30k likes 15K times more then my subs
I'm 8 months late, but with instead of Omneon, I probably wouldn't went with Abominateon. Just cuz fusing these pokemon into this massive monster is nothing short of an Abomination
I’m actually writing a story with a very similar eeveelution but I called it leegeon
One the top of my head I would name this Eeveelution Ultreon. Meaning Ultra.
Eeveeneo!
The Ultimate Eeveelution It’s Beautiful🥹
I want this to be real
Mixton
sadly you didnt color Omneon into white and siver with golden eyes 😞😞 but it looks so cool tho🤩
i would have called it infion
I would have been basic and called it fuseon, also great vids
if the ability made it every type, that would be cool
I personaly would have called it omegeon because omega can also translate to alfa so like an alfa of all eeveelotions like a all powerfull god like it is (Love this vidieo and all your content <3)
2:49 *amogus*
Omineon looks like a Super Eevee
Another even more broken idea of Omnipotent:  It works defensively as well as like Libero (Not Protean-SV)... For eg the opponent uses a Normal move... It would have changed Omnieon into a Rock/Steel type cuz it's not very effective randomly but since normal is immune to Ghost. Omnieon will become a ghost type instead...  Another example is if the opponent goes for a water move it will change into a grass type to resist hits...  Sure this is beyond godly or unkillable actually as u will not even be able to status it since it will change into the respective type immune to the status move. The opponent has only one option to set up & not-very effective sweep it...
United saying "life orb omnipotent" makes omnipotent sound like a non-moded ability
Call it noseon
You are wroNg how dare you forget that grass is good against electric type?
Dylan I have a omneon card
How about its hidden ability: Revive ANY eveelution
2:35
What was Omneon main typing within the battle ? Also in my opinion, Omneon is to overly designed
I hate scald milotic
Hidsen ability could have been *white smoke* to take away from overheats recoil effects
I would have picked the name unlimion like unlimited
My immediate idea for a name was Evoluteon but with that artwork i think Abominateon is more fitting
Greateon
What if the eevee God is rainbow eevee that has the main features of the type its using. That switched to the other pokemon weakness?
Call it multion
Asem
"If you dodge agai- DYLAN!" ~Shady 2023
Could I please see the 3D Model from Front?
It looks so cool! I WANT ONE! 😍
Penny is actually from Galar
Thanks for the video but he is so ugluy
Ugliest looking pokemon 😂😂😂😂
I would name it infinion because it have infinite power
Arcion??
I hear the sonic theme “his world” don’t think you can hide it from me>:D
the fact it hit 30k likes lmaoo
My idea is it's Allah
Don't know if you mind about: flyng, metal, maybe rock but you already did ground, and psychc. I'd like to see you again with a good video! ;)
Dylan fuse all pokémon get and I know what you want the name is going op this is a this is
Shoulda had Freezedry for water types
WHAT IF FOR DUAL ONES YOU MAKE IT SO SCIENTISTS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO BREED DIFFERENT EEVEELUTIONS TOGETHER LIKE IF YOU BREED FLAREON AND JOLTEON YOULL GET A FIRE/LIGHTNING DUAL TYPE EEVEE
Mack new pokimon
I think the dual-type eeveelution video sounds amazing especially if you do types that haven't been used to gether first and then do the others
This is AMAZING❤🎉❤🎉❤🎉
I would’ve call the Pokémon ulteon because it’s in its ultimate form so I just came up with ulteon
Omneon - Omnimon I see no difference Very creative name tho
You should combine all the Eevee lutions you made
Would of  called him omegeon
I desperately want more art of omen on and id love to make my own version, but I'm not good at making fusions lol
Beyoneon Beyond "A powe beyond god
Dylan fuse all the eevee evolution that you make and make it fight the strongest legendary POKEMÓN
Wait its kinda like type-Null's evolution where u can use discs to change type except this one doesn't use items
Can u please fuse your eeveelutions together? It would mean so much to me. 😃 Also I really LOVEE ur videos😇
Alleon, gues why? 😁 🔥💧⚡️☀️🌙🍀❄️💖
anyways my favorite is umbreon and vaporeon
pokemon is COOL AND IM A POKEMON FAN here pokemon styles☃️🧚‍♀️🍃🌞💦🌙⚡️🔥🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
*insert break through it all.
All of this to discover Sylveon was the best all along, great job. This ending is so funny.
Make the true London with your eveelocions
GODeon
A move for omneon couldve been pawn, letting it spawn eeveeloutions for subsituted and damage
We need evolution battle...
I don't like eevee I prefer pikachu 🔥w🔥
Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I would call it multineon
I'm surprised you didn't just give it it's own personal typing, just called it "Holy" and it's just super effective against all types.
Can you please dynamax it
I would have named him Multieon
I have a card that’s called Omneon and it’s white but with different parts of the other eeveeloution a
Turn Godzilla Kaiju into Pokemon please. That would be so epic!
Umbreon is a Goat
You should put fairy on him because very can disable dragon fighting and dark type Pokemon lost fairies only week two fire and poison
we'll you're at 29k ... almost there!
the bright power sinner have paid for his sins.
that will d name Godtiyon pls
I think omneon should be a legendary pokemon
Dylan I hacked you
I called it Eeveon. Obvious haha
Megion.
Dude imagine this thing with assault vest since it keeps the bulk. Replace calm mind with ice beam and it’s OVER
If there were missing element eevees it would've sweept
BIG t
PP
I like the name Omneon
I would call it godeon due to it being omnipotent
i like sylveon 🥰💗💗
WE DONT F##### CARE ABOUT UR SPONSOR
i think it's cool but how about the same color for his furr like white and black
I. WANT. THAT. IN. GAME. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You should fuse all of them plus your versions and call it Fakeon
i didsorta the same thing but for a minecraft skin!
Rematch but with all the other eeveelutions you made?
I woulda called it infineon lol
Eeveeon would be a cool name
Wow he’s that bad he had a god and still lost wow
This is the most awe video I’ve ever seen! I’m a huge fan of all eeveelutions and Omneon is just perfect for a boss evaluation for eevee i love it
Fuse 2 Evne
I think my name for it was omegeon but the people like ppl made a custom eevee e elocution they put the name omneon
How about you make eeveelutions based on the zodiac
Now you should fuse YOUR eevee evolutions. That would be inter
AMOMACION
0:32 please do
OMEGEON
Hahahahha that ending wow
You should make all the eevee  evolutions mixed with the custom evolutions
trimeon because it is all off the eveeloshins in one
My boy Eevee 😁
Eevee is just the second mascot it is the second mascot
I love ever
I like the name omneon but I think ultiteon s better
As much as I love the Eeveelutions, that is a very, VERY weird idea, but god dang is it so effective in battle!
Idk what I would call it I only could think of evoleon
POKEMON DON'T KILL
arKEYis is NOT a god
Vaporeon looking kinda fine tbh
thats such a good idea gabriel
love pokemon
I would call it eveeon
it looked really cool 😎
2:49 Among Us
Love the name
Eevee: the evolution pokemon When all of it's potential is unleashed it supasses god. Poetic.   I wonder if it can summon universe sized drills and attack with them.
OMNEON IS MAGNIFICENT!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i feel like every eeveelution mix hybrid would look like a multicolored ninetails
12:19 Wait why did his hp go up?
How does he not know Icebolt tho.
Godeon
Make dult tip eeveelutions
You could’ve made the coler seem good
Hey Dylan, I was thinking this was a great video idea, but what if you took this concept and fused the eeveelutions you made with the already cannon ones.
You should fuse all new eeveelutions and all of them new and old.
I meant prefer
I will pray for Godeon because he is a God
Unmatched
My idea for the name: infiniteon literly matched power♾️♾️♾️
Its spelled eeve lution
I feel like the name should the eevelution
mutieon
I have a Pokemon
I would love to see an evolution of eevee that has a Dragon, Steel, Rock, Ground, flying or bug typing
What is the strongest fighting type pokemon
I’m sorry man but that thing needs a better design then a stitched together version of eevee   Something more Devine and fitting the omneon name, I would think something based on an angel
Subscription. EARNED! Omneon is BROKEN. I even have a overly broken moveSET to match. Omni-Judgment This move is always the type strongest against the opponent at current. The user attacks using a physical beam of special power. (Is Physical AND Special) If damage is successfully dealt, then Omneon gains an double Omni-Boost AND the opponent gains an Double Omni-Drop! (Negative Double Omni-Boost) Omni-Booster Using this gives Omneon a random type AND a Double Omni-Boost! Omni-Dropper Using this gives Omneon a random type AND the Opponent gets a Double Omni-Drop! Omni-Dodger Using this gives Omneon a random type AND heavily boosted evasiveness!  After the battle:You... Why? YOU HAD A CHANCE TO WIN THAT AND YOU WASTED IT!
Dylan nice video man. Eevee is my favorite pokemon
Greg
I want you to call omega
I did this once for some silhouette practice and dubbed it ‘Abomonation’
Dylan even though you stopped the trilogy of the eveee, if you want to do dual type eveelutions, go ahead! I think the psychic and fairy type combination could be named "Sweeteon."
I think Eterneon would be better.
When he said that the ability would called omnipotent and that THAT would be a hint at this Pokémon’s name, my brain immediately thought of both “Omnieon” and “Divineon”
Do this again, but instead of evee’s it’s every kanto pokemon
If you play pokemon conquest omnipotent was the abbility of Arceus So you can't really use that name cause In pokemon conquest Omnipotent Heals you, Allows Normal moves to hit anything neutraly, and by i think makes your move always hit
I honestly hope to see Omnieon again. But you know what would be so cool? Like in the thumbnail to dynamax Omnieon.  But it also makes me curious. SInce you played pokemon infinite fusion. Would it be possible to try and make triple fusions of the legendary pokemon that the game can give you. But then makes a OP team and make people fight that team.
I have a quick dial Pokémon card I live at Elderwood L0 1 Elderwood and it’s right by Woodlake            💢💢💢💢💢💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟💟☮️💟💟💟💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥💜❤️🧡🖤❤️‍🩹💗💖❣️🤍💛💛🤎💕💘💝💞💔💙🏹🌟✨✨✨✨🐕‍🦺🐈🐾🐾🐩🐕🐈‍⬛🐈🐎🦚🦮
Now combien this with the eve you created
molitean
Spectreon
I said omneon lmao
*gasp* you could make it a mega of eevee, but the only way to get the mega stone is you cannot capture palkia dialga giratina or arceus, because they all have pieces of the mega stone inside of them because of a mad scientist
Also I would have called it arceon cuz it’s stronger then arceus
How about you make it immortal, here is my idea: give it wonder guard make it pure fire then give it burn up and become typeless
Oooooooo9ooooooooo9
Can you make fusion of all Pokémons, from Kalos?
That guy in the middle looks like muvan
I love your Eevee evolution shows I love Evie so much and her Eeveelutions
Omneon is a great name
abominateon
Amazing video and I like name omneon it sounds nice
Can't wait to see mega or dual-typed Eveelutions
Penny approves of this video
OMNEON IS HORRENDOUS!
You know attorney this is stronger than the pokemon you're making right
Loosing Made it 10 times better lmao 🤣 haven’t laughed like this in a while ❤
The rock part at 1:20 got me lol, I didn’t know what those rocks were for until I finished the game 😢😅❤
Eveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
My first guess for the name was Omneon lol Sometimes the best answer is the most obvious
I've thought about Omneon a LOT, Omneon is basically the only name that would work for this idea. I don't love the design you chose, a cohesive color scheme would have been better, and this thing looks disgusting. But I love the Eevee line, and I love seeing this idea actually used...now if we could just get an actually well made design, visually.
The sponsor: literally rip-off Town Of Salem
Alright fuse all legendary!
I dont love eevee i love pokemon long tel
Elementeon cuz its all eve tipes
LISTEN.         judgment eeveelution  Like—- the more the enemy attacks the less damage they do
bro a few seconds before he said omneon I was thinking it XD
I would have done everyeon
Fun fact: there is a golden Pokémon card, it’s all eeveelutions together, and it’s name is actually Omneon
It is allion
dual evee
You missed out on the chance of making it look like alien X from Ben 10 basically making it look like a galaxy and you could have done the nine tails look and given it every tail from every evelution.
you an shady should so a pokemon serius on pokemon stadium 1 an 2
A very similar concept to mega eevee from pokemon insurgence
That name  would have been so cool
Mega Eevee lucians
Dragapult is faster I’m pretty sure dragapult is 142 base speed
*so i can have a fusion of all of my pokemon? all of this time i rolled with espeon /j *
personally i would have given and all type eeveeloution a type id call the omny type, super effective vs all types but takes super effective damage from all types. kinda like the berserker class in FGO
You could also do a Omneon with your custom eevees, and/or them get both, or make an mega Omneon, with that I mean, both Omneons into one Omneon, and maybe call it idk.
well Omneon is nice but ugly af XD
Arceus' long lost sibling
They could have made it look a lot less ugly
Can you make a video where you combine all of the evolutions even the ones you made ( side note idk if this has Ben done already also if it hasn't can you call it eternion? )
I was thinking multeon or smthn but omneon is way better
Arceon (Arceus + Eon) it's the Apollo, Heracles, Ares, ECT. to Arceus' Zeus.
Could you imagine if this had baton pass. The other eevees could just spam setup moves and make omneon so much more broken.
Idea: fuse every eeveelucion that you made
For the next fusion maybe make a team of all legendary Pokémon fusion
Cool pokemon
Can you fuse every tyrouge evo and call it leechantop its the end of their names merged
BRO Omneon is so badass looking. I LOVE IT!
Eeveegod/lord
Seal?
Supreon
Better moveset would be Gemonacy, Thunderbolt, Ice beam and Overheat/Flamethrower
Elemeevee Sounds perfect
Name it randomeon
I would call it everyon😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i would name it arceion
I want Omneon more than life.
How about this name God Yawn.
I would have called omneon : the better pokemon god
Incadeon the fusion of all eevees it is said when a trainer has all eeveelutions and is in grave danger while the eevees are weak they will all form a pact with eachother and become stronger a steel and water type (I did my own typing and name it’s name is pronounced inkadeon)
E G G
Why does it look so ugly
❤
Interesting coincidence with omnipotent being it's ability with the comparison of arceus considering that it ability in Pokémon conquest
There won't be a new eevee so stop with all the lies
Everyone is just so happy for this video, meanwhile I’m questioning what in gods name is omneon’s nightmare of a design.
Penny will go head over heels if Omneon was a official Pokemon
no but like the face of the eevvee is like creepy
I would of called it Alleon
2:48 hol up what's among us doing there
Good gob
I would name it “ultraeon” because it’s the ultimate eeveelution and it would be ultra or super hard to get a eevee to evolve into it or catch a ult
Whys the other guys team mostly named after The Office characters? 😂
I would call him ultimate because it's the ultimate eeveelution
SatanGodeon
Hi me Dylan
I have idea for next trilogy: 4th Hypothetical Starter from every region (Electric type) 5 Electric Starters (Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh and Unova) in their final forms, and one already existing Part 2 same team pattern, but different mons (Kalos, Alola, Galar, Hissui and Paldea) Part 3 4th starters from: Kantonian and Hoennian but Megas, Galarian with Gigantamax and (If it's possible) Alolan with Z-move (One move, that has only one pp) and the rest of team... could be idk maybe Kalosian Mega? Johtoian Z-move? or just regular starters, like Mega Blastoise?
WHY DID YOU NOT ADD ESPEON ON YOUR TEAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
its omneon i got omneon
You should make eeveelustions for specific stats like speed,attack,sp attack stuff like that
Ever should be able to evolve into stronger (Legendary) Eveelutions by using Arceus plates. Maybe even into a version of Arceus using all of them.
I personally would name it infineon
LoL
When you made the eevee bidoof I’m coming
Combine this with the other ones that you made
Dylan, please do dual type eeveelutions!
You should’ve gave him a second trait because it is a fusion and the trait should’ve been “worshipped - for every follower (eeveelution) fallen gain 15 of every stat” I know it’s broken but as a omnipotent being I find it as icing on the cake
Ultimateon!
Did you know that Omnipotent was an ability of Arceus in Pokémon Conquest? It's a weird coincidence that Omneon got compared to Arceus who got that ability. Did you know that Omnipotent was an ability of Arceus in Pokémon Conquest? It's a weird coincidence that Omneon got compared to Arceus who got that ability...             (I mean, Omnipotent is something that people usually use to say that something is overpowered...)
Is it possible to play this game
I have seen scald tho
But think for next video you should fuse all pikachu clones
Super cool I wish I can do that
Now do it with the other 10 vees
Oh. I just realized that Omneon has moves that are the types of the first four eeveelutions. Cool.
But rock beats electric
He could have used the eevees to take few of pokemon but he  didn't does he have brain problems
Eevee evolutions that have at least two typing
A new move called omni-blast, animation similar to tri-attack, but you get to select the typing of the attack from the original eeveelutions would be so broken with omnipotent ability, always STAB and allowing you to pick typing most specific to opponents weakness. You could pretty much type cover everything with that.
great vid Dylan, though a suggestion i would give to make this fusion even more overpowered would be to give it Geomancy but i guess that wouldn't work for the theme since none of the eveelutions learn it
Now do one for all the ones you made up  And you can name it like .createon or something coz you made them up .omneon again lol .powereon  And more
0:50 everything is 130 my guess
I thought a cool name would be Fuseone
Does anyone know what song that is at 2:36 ?
I think you should fuse together all the new eeveelooshons
I would of named it “multieon” as in multiple typings.
I love so much EEVEE
omg it looks so bad, why did you have to do it so dirty
I would have actually simplified it. Eeon. A Ee from eevee and well eon from all the evolutions
Evomni because eveelution + omni
you need to make one but all the eeveelutions and the ones you made are fused
Ultimate evolution should be called omneon
Next to the regis
Way better name Fuuuuuuuseon haaaaaaa
Heck yeah! 2 best names are Amalgeon (an amalgam) and omnieon, I think this is crazy, good job!
Can You guess new Pokemon of generation 10 it will be great creation
Which are fused
You can even release some pictures of new Pokemon
What about fusion Pokemon of Pokemon scarlet and violet game
I volunteer as tribute to be the one to collect all eeveelutions
Maybe it can be Arceon Because  it can switch typing like arceus
i would have named it ultieon beacause it is the ultimate being
Penny: "MINNNNE."
Feraligtr in DLC
Feraligtr in DLC
Feta light in dlc
I just binge watched all 3 videos
Can you make a palkia of every type
Very nice video! Would say if you do this again maybe give Omneon it’s own signature move called Omni-Beam, which basically is just a move that would be the infamous ??? Typing from older games that hits for super effective damage on every type (similar to the idea of shadow Pokémon moves in Colliseum and XD)
the omnieons ribons lok like it is part suicune
u should have said that he basically took down the god of Pokemon because Omneon's stats are better than Arceus's
I would name it Rick and make it's Battle theme Never gonna give you up
You didn’t fushed all eveeelions because you missed the ones you made
Can please make more mega evolved pokemon I saw your previous one and it the megas were really good
So are we not gonna talk the about the villain origin story that Shady displayed during that battle against Dylan. Sheer perfection lol
should have went with ice beam
i think umbreon is nesha
omneeon
Make it SHINY
why do i feel like you had frank make the new thumbnail
it would be smth like unineon cause you know the universe and stuff
that is a legenderay
"{It's ability will be custom: Omnipotent.} Which will be a hint to it's name."  Me: One Punch Eevee!
bob
Make a custom eveelution pls. Fuse with other Pokémon pls do lucario and evee makes Lucarion
"Edwardddddd."
This is cool but what if you added new types for new eevees for example galaxeon the space type eevee
do a fusion of all of your evolutions then make them battle omneon
Could you create your own Paradox Pokemon, your creativity would be amazing for that ngl
i dont like the appearance of the dragon and the fused one but overall pretty cool
Hi I've been thinking of a idea you should make a mega with every eEeloution including the dual type Eveloutions
Shows you how bad Eeveeloutions are to use for competitive x.x
Love this- now pls make new Regis-
why tf is this labed mafia42????
Why he looks so goofy
What about creating an evil Eevee and then create evil eeveeloutions, ending with a evil Omneon or a different name. Something like that would be cool. Basically a Dark Eevee and it's evolutions. And I don't mean the type.  Also the persona music here was on point, great video :)
Why no ultreon
You dont mind if i try to remake it right?
I would've suggested that Omneon, just for fun, would be type chaos. A brand new type that I just made up and basically all moves have a 100% chance to crit and this Pokemon resists all attacks by 50% and cannot be crit. But that's just my opinion lol. XD
I want to know what would it look like if Pokémon returned in the sonic characters
Mafia is a great game
I want this pokemon
you should have named it eeveeon
Arceon like arceus but eevee
Chimereon - it being like a chimera being made up of parts of multiple creatures
You should do a video where you re-design all the original eeveelutions.   Just want to see what amazing designs you’d come up with for all of them !!
I’d call him elementeon because the types are like elements
Can you please make the most ugly fusion?
I love how much effort u put in these videos
Dude spent a whole Trilogy making new eeveelutions only to have them all lose and show how weak they are.  I'm actually sad by that.
You do realize that if you'd *Dynamaxed Omneon,* you'd have wiped the floor with that Dragapault - the disabling of *Omnipotent* for Three Turns would've also thrown him off, leading to Mistakes in Move Choice!
Fun fact the arceus in the pokemon conquest has the ability omnipotent
Fuse all of em even your mad
I love the Paper Mario SFX
fuse all the startes or add the customs evelutions to the fusion
i love how pochita has the hat of ace in the backaround
I would’ve called it Fuseion
YOUR THE GOAT
I swear this eeveelution has dbz vibes, as in so godly it can't be damaged and dodge everything so fast it looks like it ain't moving.
Yas
I wanna punt eevee   I will die on the hill of my take that these are piss designs and stat mons
6:48 yes, yes, penny would be proud
You should’ve dynamxed omneon
DUAL TYPE EEVEELUTIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Me: *screams*
I can’t believe Gamefreak refused to do new Eevee evolution’s. Thx for this creative fan made work.
Make Legendary beasts out the real eeveelutions!!!
I love the design but the color palet could use some work.
You have done new megas,eevelution so you should do new gigantamax
more eevees more eevees MORE EEVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Happy pokemon day
Yo thats soo cool i have a video idea why dont you make another omneon but it looks like the the first part then do another one that from the second part / video , AND THEN FUSE THEM ALL TOGETHER AND MAKE THE COOLEST AND STRONGEST OMNEON OH AND ALSO YOU SHOULD MAKE EACH EEVEE FOLLOW ITS OMNEONS
i would have called it Multeon
You should make a mega eveeloution of the evee's you made
You could have given it as hidden ability regenarator and name it gods blessing. I would have called it Infineon because its the god of the infinite eeveelutions. Can you make a video where you fuse all eeveelutions plus your own into the ultimate eeveelution. Pls.
Great video but that ending is tragic😂😭
Move penny i mre proud lol Thanks for the eeveelution vids 💙
dual type eeveelution is good
Guess you could say he *United* the Eeveelutions
if you gave it a new ability that gave it every type ever it would only be weak to rock and would have every immunity possible
So Krookodile’s nickname was literally the Og Nard dog’s full name?
You should do a regi for every type
You should do a god pokemon in scarlet and violet
I'd call it multieon
It weak
what if you made double type eevee's and both took turns picking bases and juicers?
I was gonna comment that shady never had a chance to begin with but seeing that he won gives me so much more respect for him.
Enjoy these videos a lot
We need a duel type episode
Omnieon is a awesome Pokémon
The callout to code Geass
shinveon shin=true or god
Mega eeveelutions please??
Yaaaaaaaaa🎉a🎉a🎉q🎉a🎉a🎉a🎉🎉a🎉a
you should do a fairy and fighting and call it lighteon or pureon
It looks ugly Very ugly...
Omneon is definitely the type of thing that I can picture a 10-year-old doodling on paper. 😁
It’s trending omg
I love eevee❤
Shadys hairline be like…
I always wonder how they make such good fusions,😂
Now you should give these eveelutions shiny forms
Mixed attacker using growth
You should fuse together all the 10 eeveelutions that didn't get a type that you made
eeveelutions are probably the best designs pokemon have created
Idk if anyone elsed noticed but why was the Greninja named Lebron lol
Now dude the ten that you created
That is ugly
WHy dont you make mega evolution for every eevee evolution you did extra
One of the smoothest Sponsor-transitions ever seen 😂 Amazing vid'!
How did you set it in the game?
Most of them
Well
I realized that you opponent named every one of his Pokémon based of of a name from a character from the Office
yooooo I love your vids
Make fusion between all of them including the fake ones. Or 2 video what you fused the ones from the  2 previous videos
I really enjoyed watching this video it makes me very happy whenever you post something I love it
I liked this video a lot! But you also could've went with chimereon. Like a chimera.
UnitedPlays boutta hit 400k what the freak  this man GRINDING respect
Please do the new eeveelution shiny versions in another video 🙏
I love your videos
Omneon IS SUPER CUTE!!
We need a fusion of 2 eeveelutions so like 6 fusions, even the non canon  ones
Like and subscribed to Kninja114 i gave a shoutout to you united plays!!!😊
I love your videos cause you fused all the eve the original and your own eve"s
That is awesome is cool that ultimate team ever
should of been called ultimeon
Now imagine it had parabolic charge to heal
What is his face
You just make them broken they to win cuz u have a big ego
Can you do  beevee normal bug Psychic and fighting type espeon that uses astral projection to fight And dark rock umbreon that looks like an obsidian flowing with lava
19 hr ago
So I haven't watched you in a while but just started catching up and all I can say is why don't you try making pets into pokemon starting with that adorable little puppy dog you have cause all I can say is show us more flopsy don't know I I spelled that right
i would have called it Eve
Not the art direction I would have taken. I also would suggest changing the ability to a universal resistor. Eevee is meant to be capable of adapting to any environment so I would have had the ability, instead of acting like protean, would instead change the type to resist any incoming attack. I would then have given an attack that changes type based off of the current type of the eeveelution. Yes there is some counterplay by abusing type changes but come on, OP mons still need a flaw somewhere in there
d eez nuts
I would have called it Ultimateon. 😁
I think a better way to make Omneon more op would be giving him an ice type move so he can have a better coverage ( ice and electric are two types that go well together ) and also he would be able to freeze other pokemon and would be very omnipotent ( he would freeze with the ice move, burn with scald and paralyse with thunderbolt ) and if you give him the object that increase the chance of the secondary effect of the attack Omneon would be absolutely broken ( however ice type is of the worst type in defense so 🥲 )
About mafia 42  IM A KID remember kids wacht this
My brother calls pokemon cocomon
Stareon was a myth where if you do specific things in a specific order i’m not saying the things you have to do but if you did them and went to a specific route in the game you will find a fusion of all the eeveelutions called stareon
Omneon is so close to Omnimon from Digimon. Elementeon (element), Organeon (organic), Origeon (origin), Forebodeon (Forebode)… something different that encompasses all.
the explanation with Solaris phase 2 is just too good
Why don't you make every type of regi
I'm trying my best to not to be a salty legendary spammer with that ending. Good game and design
Ewwwww
Hey I'm on Shadys team let's go
When did Pokemon start adding Digimon I think having a royal knight would be too op
I mean it look cool but it still lost
can you mix all of your custom eveelutions?
You deserved it
Fusion
The profile look curse
Plzzz make caching  randomised pokemon video
I’d love to see a dual Eeveeloutions video. I imagine a water-fairy combo would be named Selkieon. :D
Loved the video, I can't wait to potentially see the dual type eevee videos if you decide to make them, would you possibly be willing to do this kind of video again but for the 10 eeveelutions that were created for the missing types eevee didn't have, I feel like that would be cool to see
Yo, shout out to Derek
Where is the anime pokemon version?
Okok now do YOUR eeveelutions combined into one!! 😄
So much likes
Dialga and Palkia Fusion we should have gotten in legends upper half palkia and bottom half dialga water steel type
Should definitely do a eevee dual type vid and make some of the sets that haven't been made yet. Like Ice/Poison.
3 words….  WHEEL OF EEVEE!!!
MAAAAAAAN everything went perfect exept the model  In my opinion the omneon model is no that good but u do put in alot of work
Mafia 42 still exists? I haven’t played that game since I was like 15! Also I love the approach you went with this mon especially the evolution method
No legendaries from shady, doesn’t really prove that omneon is op
Wonderful end to a trilogy of Eeveelution vids, even if was in defeat. You certainly put up a good battle.
Love this stuff
I would’ve called it Ultieon because it’s the ultimate eeveelution
I wish the design was more flushed/blended but over all its a cool idea!
Guess my favorite Pokémon!
When you were thinking of what moves to give it, I thought to myself "IceBolt. EZ Clap." I remember Ice Beam + Thunderbolt from at least ten years ago and I didn't play competetive at all.  Then you didn't put Ice Beam on it and thought "This is going to come back to bite him, isn't it?" It did, in fact, come back to bite him
Could you make a mewthree next
😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😶😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
You can do this with Regis rotom (pikachu who remember the costumes) cast form (new weather effects also omg
can you make another video where you fuss the ones you made please
Ha he named his Pokémon after the office 😂
I would name my naganadel butthole because its brain is in the butthole
I love video
Supereve
this pokemon is penny's wet dream
I would've gone with Noeveon for the name since it matches the naming devices of both Eevee and the evolutions.
My name is Evie which is Eevee when said
Make every type of regi
This was so cool
Battle omneon to arceus
Pls do a final form of eeveelution
I think elemention for the element of all the type
Divineon: The Divine Pokemon
The persona 5 music definitely bumped you up to one of my top 5 YouTubers.
No lie tht sht ugly… stop murdering great idead…
1:33 battle revolution music into his world  dylan is truly the goat
0:31 please do both dylan my good sir
i would name it godeon because its like the god of eevees
The sentence used to display the use of Omnipotent 😂
The sentence used to display the use of Omnipotent 😂
When will the next mega video come out.
I would have called him Zenith meaning the best or the maximum evolution
yippeevee was right there tho
I think T-wave accuracy goes down in sandstorm
There’s like some whistle sound in the music and every time It trips me out because I think someone is messing with me and whistling outside my door
Honestly, ice beam would have been WAY better, cuz as much coverage as that set provides, it gets hard walled by dragons
He knows he has to fuse all of his creations
I LONVE POKEMON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Id like to see one of these with the hitmons.. make new versions like hitmongrap(a grappling version)
Dylan has calm mind every person that plays competetive pokemon showthing at there screens quiver dance is calm mind and speed boost
I would call it ultreon
The Sheer Determination of Pokémon stop *them* from winning. Even if *they* ARE *Broken* ... EDIT: *They* / *Them* refer to crazy Pokémon like Omnieon, Arceus, Miraidion/Koraidon.etc.etc.etc
Hey duel type eevees I made goopeon psychic /dragon and it was yellow blue eyes
I wanted to say that you should put omneon up against franks beast, but nevermind haha
Hey Dylan this video was great I would love to see you fuse the eeveeltuions YOU made I think it would look really cool. As an alternate to omneon I thought about potenteon potent from the Latin word potentia for power and eon or maybe invicteon invict once again from the Latin word invicta meaning unbeatable and eon
I wanna see you fuse all your OWN eeveelutions and see how that ends up (Maybe in the sets that you made them)
omneon is the ugliest thing i have seen in my life
Classic UP moment
ElementalOn
why the thumbnail change
Hi
I like the name Phenomeon. Phenomenal, and an unnatural Phenomenon
Dylan I think u should have named it multeon because it’s multiple eevees
I would name it ultyeon for Altamonte power
I haven’t finished the vid yet but my guess is that it is called Omnion
You should fuse your eeveeloutions and battle
Facts that people don't know: Sonic is omnipotent  Pikachu has near infinite potential
Hey can you do another battle wwith omneon
Now can everyone agree that in a lot of these eevee vids there was a dragapult that carried the other team to victory
4:28 @Vinny
The God eevee must have the name          Eevee
Wish it was able to get Eevee's Z-Move! Omneon is such a perfect name
Omneon is dope, but I think Id gone with Chimereon since its a combination of all the eeveelutions
What a great battle, Thanks Dylan for an exciting battle!!!
its funny how this is the only pokemon that can match mega rayquazas stat total
Shady chose the best comparison for Omneon. he's right it really does look like something from Majora's Mask rofl. That ending was just so heartbreaking yet hilarious. This was a great trilogy.
centiscorch actually has scald 3:26 (i know this because my centischorch has scald)
THE POKEMON BATTLE REVOLUTION MUSIC YES
I would've called it 'Fuseon =fusion' or 'Arceon=arceus '
I love how whenever omneon hits the field Will Power starts playing. This was a great trilogy of videos
its so ugly
All magnets cause because edgy trail
Penny from pokemon scarlet and violet will be proud.
next time you could do any kind of regi, it would make a great video
I know it's not spelled differently but omnimon is a digimon
In a way it can evolve naturally. When a normal evee who can't discide who it wants to be that evee wanders off to the forest at a certain time when the sun and moon are alined to we're u can see both directly across from each other then that evee calls the ghost\ ancestors of all eveelutions together those eveelutions then create a ring around that evee then it sits down and closes it eyes an sings to the wind the ancestors then sing along an fly around with the wind around that evee. Then that evee falls asleep an wakes up as the mega evolution evee. :)
