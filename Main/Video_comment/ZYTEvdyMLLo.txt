Love this guy, says it as it is, And has talked the talk. Great result
Only Married her because she went to the Middlesbrough v Everton match In November 2008 at the Riverside Stadium...  ...She phoned her contact In the Everton Dressing Room and he came out and gave us 2 free tickets ffs Boys and Germs...
The Everton USA Chairwoman 2009...She has Buggered off to Sunderland or Durham and I am furious...Not really...She was a Fucking Nightmare Boys and Germs...  ...Took my Last-Name and Sodded-Off with her English Citizenship ffs Kidz...
You have to wonder why Sean was out of work for so long, great guy.
Brutal made them do a beep test 😮
I love it went you beat arsenal thank you
Future England manager.
Burnley heading to the Prem. Sean heading to the Champs
💙
Top man! 💙
Take a shot everytime he says “hard work” or “graft”
guy is a goat
Don’t know why, Dyche is really fascinating to me as a United fan. I feel he’s just blunt and straight to the point who takes no nonsense.   I hated going to Turf Moor and now I’ll hate going to Goodison. Hope we beat him every time we play but apart from that, I hope he does really well.   Dyche is a misunderstood character imo.
I've got McNeal and Tarki but we'd all like some Wood
When does Jay Rodriguez sign for Everton then?
Good  luck Sean I think you will  do well
I could listen to him talk all day long 😅
This guy gargles with gravel! C'mon Sean!
Not a fan of Everton but l am of Sean Dyche and l wish him well and as a Spurs fan even more against arsenil
“I’m your new manager…for a while….until you sack me”
Very happy to see him back. I think he’s unfairly put in a box about playing style etc. but let’s not forget what budget he was working with at Burnley. I hope they succeed and I’m not even an Everton fan!!
I’m a fan in the states, last week my best friend calls me and says, “let’s bet on the Arsenal game”  Going to text him today and throw some dough on my Everton, we WILL WIN tomorrow!
This fella has gone along way is resurrecting my belief in this team
Arsenal fan, hes the right man for the job, hoping he keeps you lads up, but save the bounce back for the Liverpool match. Everton have to be in the top division.
انا خائف على نادي إيفرتون تحتاجون الى معجزة للنجاة من هبوط الى درجة الثانية
THE QUALITY IS INCREDIBLE, CREDIT WHERE ITS DUE @EVERTON
Sean is that kind of guy that puts people in their place and makes them aware of their behavior, I love how he responds to the reporter at the start asking questions 😂
Confidence breads confidence
This bloke has given me confidence. No diplomatic drivel on offer here - just raw honesty that resonates with us all. Come on Sean - let's get out of the shit together!
Brilliant manager
organised draws won't save them.....
Come on  Sean. Get into them
Get ready for championship
The best Everton press conference I have ever seen!! Dyche seems to have already taken the job and club by the scruff of the neck and say let’s go and crack on, we have work to do!! Best of luck Dyche you have my support !! 💙
Proper brexit, no nonsense manager. Go on gaffer!
Always liked no nonsense attitude of Mr Dyche, speaks very well..
Dear Sky Sports. Your tendency to dig a hole for Sean (or any coach) to fall in to is plain pathetic.
Lampard was too timid and poor tactically. This man definitely isn't.
What a man.
His point round the 4:30 mark about not needlessly signing players is a very relieving point, from an Everton manager at least. Think about Delle Ali, Al Ghazi, many more of recent memory. Literally pointless signings that make us worse for no reason. It's almost like if we'd just kept our squad instead of buying and selling from 2017, we'd be in a much better spotm
Good luck Dyche on the game and I hope you do well COYB 💙💙💙
Pavandeep Johal do not worry about anything mate.former season ticket holder supports Everton and my mums uncles live in Newcastle and Glasgow and I see you last Game of season I can play Left Foot striker or Right Back.
Sean you’ve been here 10 minutes, you don’t need to lecture the fans.
Everton will be in the championship soon
We miss Sean
He said that he is a Marmite manager, lmao. I love his attitude.
If Dyche is more of a dick than a nice guy, maybe he'll get the good - time - Charlies to play like dogs - of - war.
This is definitely not going to end well. 😂
Journo:- "obviously the back end of last season at Burnley ended quite badly"  Sean:- "Not for me it didn't I wasn't there mate, just thought I'd let you know, in case you'd forgot"   😂😂😂😂😂   Love him already
spurs fan. hope everton stay up, and beat arsenal
Gets the sack if they go down.
Perfect guy for Everton at the time.  Very happy whether by luck or judgement.
Come on Sean lad 💙💙
Good and interesting interview, COYB! 🔵👍🏻👏🏻
Great first press conference Sean came across very well. Dealt with tricky questions batted them off with ease. He is right we cannot buy players for sake of it whom not going improve our squad. More confident now let’s get behind Sean and squad and get Goodison rocking again. Up the toffees!
Worms for breakfast, washed down with gravel.
What an amazing conference he has given, such an intelligent and well spoken guy, best thing to come of Goodison for years
Good luck to Sean...a really really tough job..but I'm a toffee and a toffee till I die right behind u...hope u can do it...
We've got the right manager at last, just need the right players now.
Top top manager let’s gooo Dyche 💪💪💪
Brilliant Sean, you talk sense! You've got aptitude. Like I said before I'll back you all the way. A clear mindset, all up for the players and fans. A great press conference. COYB! When I listened to this, I felt passion. 👍👍💪💪
As an Arsenal fan I really admire this man and hope the best for Everton
After seeing this post,  If Sean can't get a tune out of these players, no other manager will!
When he said 'polish them down' he meant 'dressing them down' but didn't mean to say it. He's given them some home truths. In Dyche I don't trust, I know.
I have been telling my blue nose mates for years (as I am a red) that they should get Dyche. They used to laugh at me, but honestly, he is a brilliant manager. Way more tactically astute than he gets given credit for. He also embodies that aggressive, front footed and direct approach the fans want. The manager and the team should embody the fans, as Klopp does at Liverpool. He isn't negative. He is direct, but that can be attacking. He is also a delight in less conferences. Brilliant appointment, albeit, 5/6 years late (when less money)
We're in safe hands, the best hands possible. This is the best decision Everton have made in 21 years. Let's go you blue boys! NSNO.
Delighted listening to this. Sean you have my 100% support. Board not so much.
This is shameful! How can the club toss Dyche out to the media and present himself? Where is the presentation and presser by Thelwell and/or the board welcoming him? What a disgraceful farce this is.  Good on you though, Dychy, great attitude.
No bullshit there folks..  It is what it is.. and we'll sort it! and god help any players who don't believe it!  - Wishing you all well for Sat
Vinny from sky is excellent
Dyche impress me he don't sound too proud  hope it work out for him I glad he get the job I had him to get it I didn't want  big Sam or the guy from leads
Looks great in that kit!!!! Come on Dyche!! I hope you save this beautiful club!!! UTFT
Big brother cameras?
You people don't have patients or know players look at Deulofeu and lookmañ one fool told me two years ago lookman is no good I hope you watching him
Sean is the person i've wanted as our manager for years finally he's here i have 100% faith in him
24:23 😂
Aa long as some fans encourage players. Stop calling them shite. Hows that good for confidence?  Also if go a goal down continue singing and support. All this negativity is no good. The past has gone. GET BEHIND THE WHOLE CLUB
Excellent PC. Always had respect for Sean and he's a cracking bloke as well. UTFT COYB NSNO EAW
Good luck Sean and Everton for the remainder of the season....you can do it !!
I think we have been crying out for a manager as truthful and blunt as this man, forget your blue eyed boys and world renowned, he is in the Howard mould, just an opinion COUFB
The key message is let's play as a team stick together an we can do this COME ON YOU BLUE BOYS
Too bad he doesn’t have the players to keep Everton up
Great appointment for the championship next season
What a breath of fresh air. Good luck Sean! UTFT!!
Good look Dyche' lad
Sean could lose every game this season I wouldn't blame him ever...please don't sign ayew he's no better than what we got
YEEESSS COME ON DYCHEY. Clear your throat lad 😂😂😂
Top man manager and top bloke....he will do for me. UTFT.
Actually looking forward to seeing The Blues play this weekend! Can’t wait to see Dyche at Goodison park, I know the fans will be on top of their game! I’ve zero expectations but I don’t care
Say what you like but he is a great guy. The players will give everything for him….have no doubt. I really hope he succeeds
It's an impossible job for him to take but I am fully backing him 100%.
Hi good to see a guy who talks straight  and crystal clear  .the best of Luck Sean 👍
Im happy we got Dyche, he's a very good manager. It will be a huge achievement if he manages to keep us up. If he doesn't he's the man to get us back up.
Let's give them that window... Fuck the board. support the team ! Utft 💪💙
That's my manager 💙
Come on Everton!! Dyche is what we need right now, looking forward to him getting started and seeing what he brings in direction for the football club for the rest of the season
UP THE DYCHE TOFFEES 💙💙💙💙
As a Man United Fan .... Listening to Sean Dyche i believe he s a top man and will do well for Everton givern the backing  and his outlook ...
You will never see a more honest and genuine manager than Sean! I’m not an Everton fan, but even I’m excited for the club! I’m sure they will go places with him at the helm!👍 PS. Why is it sodding journalists seem to be knocking/trying to trip him up before he’s even started - they really p*@s me off!!!🤬
Andre Ayew is better than what Everton has then ? Because they’ve been trying to sign him 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shite 💩
2:50 Damn good question, worded it very nicely
hes already an evertonian👍i trust his mindset UTFT
Love this man's voice
The Royal Dyche in Burnley and the soon to open Dyche Arms in Walton. 2 boozers Dyche
If the team play like he talks we're on the way
im glad we have got sean...i feel more positive now
The squad is assembled with panic buys, we've tried the other way maybe we get a different result by not signing the usual dross after a move in Jan.
Refreshing.
If I was a player Dyche would inspire me to play my best.
Reckon dyche can get us out of this mess
Absolutely disgraceful that the club have not said anything about transfers and have left Dyche to answer those questions. Get this shithouse board out
Sean doesn’t need to worry about Sat every Everton Supporter will be right behind the team and onwards…We will give him and the team all the help to the end of the season…..
allways enjoyed a dyche press conference when he was at burnley, the confidence flows out of him and if only 50% of it hits the players we will definitley stay up coyb
Plz no toxic goodison on sat
Well fucking said, I'm with you. Let's beat arsenal Saturday. Come on Everton
If anyone can do it, it's Dychey!
Saying all the right things, excited to see what this “marmite manager” can do with Everton!
There's nobody on this Earth that can dislike Sean Dyche (possibly excepting a few Blackburn Rovers fans} Now Everton fans have got to back him and the team. 110 percent!
In Sean Dyche's last full season as Burnley manager there were EIGHT U21 players in the first team squad, so he's not afraid of bringing players through.  He'll be checking out the youngsters and any senior player who doesn't give 100% is going to be moved aside IMO.
Solid, sensible and underrated guy, he will do well. Now is the time to forget the board issues and get behind the man and his team
Sack the board
Great no derby next year blue shite going down
Championship players that’s what you got
Sold as a rock 🪨!! Didn't give anything away that he shouldn't of & was honest & open about everything absolutely brilliant 👏,we've not had a manger who's as solid as Dyche straight forward talking says it how it is,doesn't hide behind anything. Top class lad,Top class 👏.  "Am like Marmite hahaha brilliant,& when he said he doesn't want flannel from his backroom staff love it!! Ok we've not signed anyone that's not down to him I think there'll be 1 or 2 surprises coming 🤔....But look lets get behind him as that's what HE needs & DESERVES,lets get behind the TEAM as that's what they NEED & DESERVE!! Like he said "he knows OUR passion,he knows GOODISON ROCKS like hell so lets give him OUR full support people. He said while he's there he'll look after the club,it's in good hands I believe him. He's the first hard as nails manger we've had in a long time he knows what he's up against,he knows what to do. EVERTON F.C LETS GIVE HIM EVERYTHING,GIVE THE TEAM EVERYTHING,LET'S STAY UP AND SEAN TAKE US PLACES. Up the toffees,up Dyche,up the team COYB,COYB LET'S GET GOODISON ROCKING FOR EVERYONE.  Much love 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Nobody wants to go there
If this doesn't make you feel positive I don't know what will, honestly I know we didn't bring players in but Sean's attitude is all we want if the players buy into it I'm sure we will be fine, hopefully he can get us scoring
Made me listen to the very end, he knows what is needed. No question about that,   hopefully the players can respond because the fans will , as always. UTFT
i think Sean is a very confident man, knows what he wants from his players and will get them to play to their strengths,  and the way our fans can support the team we've got a fighting chance.UTFT
Leader
100% behind dyche dyche baby! Cannot wait to be at goodison and given my full backing.
The board shocking they left him face up on his own where is thurwell he should be there with him
Great mindset
Yes Dychey
Dyche is exactly what we need
Dyche is the man to keep us up, let’s all make sure we back him & the players 💪
Sean Dyche has literally resurrected my hope in Everton!  He has such a great, realistic attitude.
Not a Everton fan,  but would  bet Everton will stay up with this man charge.
Fully behind Sean!! Very impressive intro. C'mon....
Big brother cameras, oh yell me we have a prime doc currently being filmed
23:31 Quote of the day. 🤣
Come on the lads
I like Sean Dyche. Sounds like he won’t take any shit💙
Nice easy 1st game arsenal lol
He`s ginger and blue  he`s ginger and blue Sean Dyche  he`s ginger and blue.....nailed it lol
Coyb
Excited about the Dyche era!
If Sean dyche keeps us up he will be treated like a god,  we have faith in you Sean.
Brexit means Brexit
Well he's different god knows we need different  .
Best of luck Sean dyche.  Coyb Utft. 👍💙
LOVE  THE   ALIGHN   ANGLE   HE'S   USING   ALOT !  GOOD   LUCK   SEAN  LAD.
Sean Dyche's' calendar goes straight from March 31st to April 2nd, because no one fools Dyche.
Much maligned but highly intelligent guy. The Board's ineptitude cost him a shot at the transfer window which was a sin. Good luck, he's the man for the job and at last a good decision even if they go down.
Dogs of War attitude right there.. good luck lad! UTFT 💪💙
SACK THE BOARD
When the going gets tough the tough get going, we'll all be 100% behind Stone Cold Sean Dyche & the Boys Saturday. REMEMBER hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard enough. COYB let's do Arsenal Saturday then the RS! 😀🤪👍💥💥💥💙
Prediction Premier League Season 2022-2023 : Everton FC 2-1 Arsenal FC.
"i'm learning why there's noise from the Evertonians about the club" - Yeh I bet you did mate leaving finch farm at 10pm with 0 signings on deadline day, welcome to the Circus
3 Days into the job and he has to sit there and justify why we've let players leave and brought nobody in. Even Rondon could have made a decent striker in a 4-4-2 but na we even let him walk and he's joined a better club
We didn't just want to sign players for the sake of it.. We tried about 10 players and they all said no to us that's why! What a load of crap
Time for us all to back Sean. He’s been placed in a horrendous position and will no doubt have to be the one that answers some really tough questions when it’s the board and owner we want answers from. We may not stay up but I’m sure he’ll give it his best shot with the minimal tools he has at his disposal. UTFT 💪🏻
I love him already 💙
Dyche will now have to try turn this team around with even less attacking options in a team that struggles for goals. Talk about tying one hand behind his back before a ball is even kicked. Feel sorry for Duche already.
He will keep Everton in the PL . Decent stable manager
Enjoyed that. He’ll have them fired up for the weekend for sure!
Same old bollocks 😴
Sent him out there on his own the fucking cowards?
Poor Frank often looked terrified but Dychsie fears no man!
just a little bit Alan Partride/ David Brent /lads holiday (with hard graft) vibes....im all for it  UTFT!
Take these rats down fella finish what Rafa started 😎
Top guy good luck 👏
So brexit 😂 he will turn simms into a monster
Great demeanour and attitude....hopefully the players can match it
Sorry we have known we need a Striker for over 12 months and we didn't get one in. 12 months!!!! The player should have been signed sealed and in by early December latest. Not us though, were not very good at doing things on time...
Good luck big fella COYB UTFT 🔵 ⚪
The fact Kenwright is still involved with transfers says it all. He knows nothing about football and it’s embarrassing
No one needs to tell the fans to support the team and how important our support is, we kept the team up last year and it’s time for them to step up and repay that. That being said we’ll all be behind the team like we were last year I’m sure UTFT
The club is a joke. Dyche is a mug for staying with us.  Farhad and Bill OUT
What a great attitude Sean Dyche has! 💪 Surely the Everton players will embrace it and then it can shine from their performances! 🤗
Starts around 13:10  Come on Everton, a little basic video editing, trim the empty stuff. It's not hard.
RED MICROPENIS??? 😢
Great guy, well spoken, just work hard and get us in mid table, please!
On the phone constantly on the last day of the window. FFS not good enough!! No bad on Sean, not his fault and wishing him the very best.
Sean do the entire league a favour by forcing a sweet draw against arsenal come saturday 💪💪💪
4-4-2
Sean Dyche is a top manager 👌
What’s with the 13 minutes at the start of the video 😂
The motherfucker starts at 12:54
Starts 13:00 COYB NSNO UTFT
