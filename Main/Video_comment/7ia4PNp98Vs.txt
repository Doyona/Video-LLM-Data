BRING THE WHITE BACKGROUND BACK!!! the blue is so depressing!!!
8:06 wow the disrespect to percussion
🥹me and himashu cm know 🥹❤
👨‍💼👩‍🎤💖💖💖🐕🐕👗👠🇺🇲🇪🇺🎼🎼🎼🖥📹🗄🗄🗄
they literally marked the more expensive water lol
I want to write something, but I can't, cause' I have a girlfriend, sorry.
She is so pretty
Bruh those edits ruin the video
lemme be a woman lemme be a woman lemme be a woman , woman woman woman
É sou restrito tem q pedir❤
11:55 "i picked the badder"💀
she's very humble! i love how she says the truth about the quality of the expensive products
‘There’s no difference in the quality of wood’ and then she keeps pointing out how the cheaper ones have a more open grain and are worse quality of wood😂
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰
Watch the one w Maddie zeigler and it’s the same perfume and switched price
She’s such a Pisces ❤
garbanzo - xQcow
I love her and she's so Incredible live
The edits are so irritating!
shes so beautifull
That perfume is NOT $43
Who chooses the items for these vids
SnSnow snow ❄️ 😍 🍊🥠
Y’all gave her some tough items!
you guys are so unfair with her its actually ridiculous and funny
We didn’t forget that Madison supported BLM (an organization where the leaders stole the money and used it for mansions)❤. How sweet she is for supporting the demolishing of innocent peoples businesses
5:06
Nobody wanna know if she can tell cheap from expensive tf
Is it just me or did I see the tape at the bottom of the cup…..
she seems like a wonderful woman
"This feels like plastic garbanzo" said after she picks the literal piece of plastic as the expensive one
She is beautiful and sweet
wait but i actually find the editing sooo cute 🎉 gud job editor hehe 💗💗
she's gorgeous!!❤
She’s so real. Proud to call her idol.
the purple sticks are more expensive lol, it takes more time to create a tip like that than the red ones
Gold hoops, if the wear backing is silver, it's the cheaper one 100%
please make a video with olivia rodrigoo!!!!
I literally just watched that Maddie Ziegler video and it show the pink perfume as the more expensive one
Sickening, shocking but not surprising. How does this happen? Who in their right mind seriously suspects a child of stealing multiple cars? It's because he is a black child. We have to call a spade, a spade.
shes so adorable
Omg they r bullying her with the items hahaha
The random Bts meme pls
Don’t get me wrong, I love Madison but why are you guys always speaking about the person in the comments instead of making comments about the actual video?
I always used to lowkey judge people who had celebrity crushes but now I’m humbled cause I’m definitely crushing and it needs to stop 😂
Polished cotton
12:12 LMAOOO
8:13 LOOL
All that plastic surgery and couldn’t pin back her ears
the lancome perfume is NOT $43
I’ve never watched her interviews before. She’s so sweet and nice. Love her personality 🤍 quite rare to see it’s refreshing
whoever edited this needs to go to jail
She is a very sweet and down to earth chill person I love her so much
I feel attacked i did gymnastics when i was younger i had a similar leotard from the expensive one
Love herrrr❤️‍🔥
She's so chill, love her
She is so funny omg!! 😂❤
👍
She thinks those off brand gloves are expensive wait til she finds out how much winnings and grants cost😭😭
lol I was a gymnast for 7 years and could immediately tell u the more expensive one. The more uncomfy and more rimstones  usually are the more expensive. Definitely a leo for a gym meet
as a gymnast the leotard that was cheaper i see alllll the time in my gym
This women is a brick
1:52 WHAT IS BTS DOING HERE LMAO
crushing hard
Maddie Ziegler had the same perfume and the prices were switched.
Her ears 😂 she’s lucky she can hid those
Bro who edits these
Please stop giving ppl like this attention. She's famous for nothing.
She look like Megan Fox.
Go go?
lol this is the hardest looking one yet and I'm here for it
they confused the perfumes lol. in the video with Maddie Ziegler it’s the other way around
this is the first video i watched in the new year
I deff thought drumsticks were way more expensive than that. And boxing gloves, was really surprised they weren't like hundreds of dollars
The editor is so cringe lmao
when she realized the bad water is theirs xD
Personally i liked the edits
that little bts gif hehe
notice how the most replayed is the bts gif part
The editor is so aggressively millennial.
The way she just does asmr in the middle of the video-  ILOVE HER
In different video a celebrity chose the orange perfume and it was more expensive. It literally has the same products. Scammer
The morons that already choose their pathetic lives are not from the future
Stick and stone will brake your bones and words certainly will not hurt you Blue the clue Chew on that Bat hat Cat trap Lap
For the boxing gloves its the stitching and the material that is the fastest way to tell which is more expensive. (I box lol don't come for me)
What's funny about these is that I think every housewife would get all of these correct.
MADISON!😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Sydney Sweeney had the perfume one too and for her it was the pink was that was more expensive
Still wont get over that video of her saying ariana asked to her to be in the thank u next video.. like girl.....
the gifs and random captions are annoying
I love how she is down to earth
When she sniffed the hoops 😂😂😂
Love Madison
Drumstick are just big chopsticks
literally every Celebrity I don’t like expensive things literally 2 hours later doing there 1000 dollar face routine
😍😍😍😍😍😍🥰
in another video the yellow perfume was the cheaper one and it’s the expensive one here
Shes so sweet
My dream came true 👍 😍 ❤️ 💖 💓 💕
MADDIEE
PLEASE BRING HER BACK
The drum sticks one was really rude, they look pretty the same.  However, i could literally listen her for hours and hours and never getting tired, she's so adorable.
Bts at 1:52 😁
all the stickers and memes were so annoying in my opinion
She definitely has expensive taste, you can tell, but shes still very down to earth :)
this just proves to us that brands use our “ rich wannabe “ feeling to make us pay ridiculous amount of money when we rarely find a different between cheap and expensive products
Y'all set this girl up!!!!
Madison is an expensive taste ❣🤍
She’s right… they did set her up for failure lol. Like boxing gloves, drum sticks… what? 😂🙄🤷🏻‍♀️
1:52 DONT TELL ME IM THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW WHERE THIS MEME IS FROM 😭😭
They tried to set her up these price points were so close to each other like what lol
Fleece lined? Mayb? Lol
She is so cute omg😍
She’s cute Af idk why people hate her for
need a round two with her with like makeup and skincare
Love her ⭐️
Very interesting 😊
I adore this woman!
She is so adorable 🥰 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
MY GIRLY <33
Invite Demi 🥹♥️
I love her but this is not her best look 🙈
She makes her decisions too fast and doesn't take the time to understand each product, but that just means she doesn't really care and prefers whatever that works lmao.
my wife ate
She’s so fun and entertaining watch she’s genuinely such a chill  cool girl
I wish you would show us the prices I wanna know too lol
Love her personality so much! Sorry for judging her when she’s just new. Forgive me.
lol, someone who is just guessing randomly should get ~50% right
OUR LOVEEEEE❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wait i just see bts gif up there😭💜 but yes i love madi
the cutest n prettiest girl 😭😭 i love her so so much 🫶🏻💗💝💕💘💞💓💖
are 50 dollars leather pants just not expensive 💀
hehe looks like she did this interview on the same day as the elle song association vid
i knew exactly this kind of communication is happening out there.That is how they making you fall in love
too many emogis and gifs .... ANNNNNOYING
They need to put Mr beast or One of the kardashians
Valkyrae being Valkyrae. 😁
Hey cosmopolitan I need Kylie here PLEASEEE❤
Omg the bts go go meme
more videos with madison !!
SUADE FOR THE LEATHER OANTS THING LMAOOOO❤️❤️
The expensive ones are always on the right.
She’s so nice ahhhh met her when she was on tour, she’s so cute and so tiny ahh she’s the sweetest
omg, i've waited to see Madison on this game for soooo long, it finally happened 😍😍😍
So sweet, so beautiful, so talented🫶🏼
Brands of water ? That’s a thing ?
She is such a sweetheart ❤️🥺
i love her!
It's so much fun to see her reaction over the "same" products. She looks like a very classy and expensive girl, but in heart she's just an ordinary girl like the rest of us who love comfortable things over the price ;)
cosmopolitan can you stop with all the gifs? are y'all 45?
SHE IS SO SWEET!
MADISON PLAYING THE DRUMS WAS SO FUNNY!
MADISON SHOULD CREATE HER OWN VLOG CHANNEL!
The sweetest 💗💗
adore her :)
yes this video is cute whatever now go stream Life Support because it is one of the greatest debuts of a pop girl.
-rep boring bvideo - darren hu
MADISON COME TO TAIWAN!! - wowkie zhang
don't her earlobes hurt
I don't get people, how could anyone even hate her, she's so cute 😭❤️
She was right about the perfume; Lancome La Vie est Belle is about twice the price of Guess Bella Vita.
Who another beige
But wait in all the other videos the yellow perfume bottle is the cheapest one, and there was the Lancôme La vie est belle which is a luxurious perfume, how was it the 48 dollar one ?
Cosmo u better ask mads back, we need more madison content
no shes too cuteeee
go away
Perfume is inaccurate
This is just the best series ever
No shade but Micky mouse ears
She picked the “badder” water😂 love her
I love her earring hoops are everything.
She’s so sweet 🥰🥰
seriously how can someone not love her?!
EVELYNN!!! <3
comfort person <33

This video is proof, always TRUST YOUR GUT over logical reasoning lol
She's so sweet

The BTS gogo dance gift
🙌
she’s so precious, i love her so much 😭
She's so lengggg
A musician would know the difference between a pair of drumsticks😭
the way she reacted to the water was so funny 😂 i love her
I thought the music at 00:12 was cbat omg😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Please have Alexa Demie on here!!!!
She reminds me of that girl that is intimidating because she’s really pretty and popular that you know of but don’t personally know, but when you randomly get to interact with her is incredibly sweet and nice, so refreshing🤍
My Pisces queen 💕
I felt that girl
Yo she don’t know nothing lol
She seems very down to earth and intelligent. Enjoyable to watch.
Surprised she's not better at this since she has to look at cheap talent and looks in the mirror everyday and has to pay for all those expensive plastic surgeries 😹😹😹😹😹
Funny how she was smelling the hoops her face after smelling them lol
U r so pretty
Aww I can’t I love the way she thinks 🥺🥺😭😭
I'm sorry but this is sabotage !!! All the stuff are so HARD!!
she looks like her younger self here ALLOT
Will y’all ever have Melanie Martinez?
She’s so sweet ahhhh
Actually the perfume is wrong, one is from guess and is like 30 dollars. The other one however is called la vie est belle so maybe there has been a mix-up
She's so sweet! Cosmo, I loved that BTS dancing gif at 1:51 😻
Heartwarming sweetheart🥰
my beautiful baby!!! love you so much
so perfect inside and out
i love her so much it hurts
my absolute favorite
she’s always so invested in the experiments I love herrr
her personality is so heartwarming, she’s the sweetest and has the kindest soul and her interviews and things like this that she does always makes me so happy and i’m so proud of her because she’s more comfortable doing activities like this luv her🤍🤍🥺
