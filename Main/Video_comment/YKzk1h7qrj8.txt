Sorry Arnold, the tribe has spoken.
Someone laughed hard writing this commercial
okay i love the end where they basically suggest killing peppa, just dark but funny
I friggin screamed at Knuckles the moment he opened his dolt mouth. 😆
He’s looking for Peppa Pig
Hey barnold
Cancelled my Disney+ account and all of its other affiliations. It’s time to start voting with our dollars !!!!!
"I can stretch" a simple line from Monkey De Luffy in the masterpiece One Piece Odyssey but it speaks to a far deeper truth about the nature of Monkey De Luffy's disposition. Monkey De Luffy, has lived through some of the hardest moments of life up to that game, he's seen kingdoms rise and fall and the inevitable deaths of those he cared for. However, with this one line, he shows that he is greater then one mere human life. He is flexible and no matter what this world throws at him, he may bend but he will not break.
Officer Dangle, how did you get here?
Knuckles could've just climbed up there
1:36 "He just thre me hi-" - Arnold
“And Creed’s here”  Glad they finally realized that they’re a punchline.
1:07 so we're not gonna talk about how Patrick Stewart, just kissed Arnold's head?
bro halo chef is there thats crazy
I love how Patrick Stewart woke up and chose violence.
The reason master chief didn’t get noticed is because the halo show sucks
The fact that Arnold was so ok with it
He just threw me high ... (Smack) 😂😂😂
I love you Arnie! 💙💙
maybe they should of thought of a better idea then throwing arnold
JEFFFFFF PROBSTTTTT
Knuckles  was  here  but how
Knuckles could easily climb it, but stays quiet about just so he could see what happens.
These were the best ads during the Super Bowl. The ONLY good ads during the Super Bowl.
Patrick Stewart is the best.😂
This song will always remind me of the movie  Titan AE
I could imagine if Peppa would probably be screaming and running away after they all ( minus Dora) point to her as a plan, or they all probably just choose someone else.
*What is this?!*
Shut your face 😂
Not them doing peppa pig dirty at the end
Knuckles you can climb
I mean….knuckles could scale up the wall 😂
Can’t Knuckles climb?
L Dora design and L Knuckles voice
Don't worry, arnold is 90's nicktoons character, with the lil' bit of toon force on his side, he'll be fine.
This is the best Super Bowl commercial of all time. Change my mind!
1:39 RRAAAAHAHHAHAHHAHAAAAA HEY ARNOLD! U GOT SMASHED LIKE WHEN I THROUGH FOOT BALLS 🤣
Not pepper  nooooo
1:52 For a second I thought Peppa said "I'm dead"😂
Guys Peppa Pig is done for for a skin because she’s turning into bacon
Helga would be UPSET when she sees Arnold being thrown.
Of course Tua couldn't throw it far enough
Oh dear
Sir Patrick’s lucky that Arnold’s a cartoon because otherwise we’d have a real big problem here
O dear.
look at all the ips we own
What is professor x doing bro😭😭😭
Guys, I think they’re gonna add one more pork chop and bacon to the freezer in Walmart 😂 1:53
1:51 “oh dear”
We gotta see peppa next
This looks like something that'd happen in one of my dreams
Oh dear, had me rolling to Mars 1:53 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why is no one talking about peppa's oh dear
Imagine if helga witnessed
“Oh dear” Broke my neck 🤣
That was a great plan just don’t mention this to his parents
FINS FOR LIFE!
Rip peppa
Greatest commercial ever made
It's the fifth quarter and you need a hole-in-one before the 7th inning stretch.. that's when he knew he fukd  up.. and try to put a burial hole on the child He infected with the virus
I soy'd my pants so hard when I saw fragile old Picard degrade himself with various Things(tm) and then gaped my mouth so large in excitement when obscure forgotten cartoon popped up.
This is still the GOAT of commercials. 😂
Knuckles!!!
I need a gif of Arnold flying
CAN YOU TAKE ME HIGHER🗣🗣🗣
The 💩 Emoji throws Hey Arnold!
The funniest thing was creed appearing out of nowhere
Imagine if Tua runs into the mountain 😂
Paramount, these commercials were a sign to just make a series called “Paramount Mountain” the biggest crossover since Smash Bros Ultimate.
Peppa’s cooked😳
Punt formation! *Kicks Peppa*
I like how knuckles pointed at peppa
Words CANNOT describe the sudden and intense JOY I felt seeing this for the 1st time bavk in 2023!!! I'd be VERY surprised if this wasn't a commercial shown during SuperBowl 😂😂😂
Star Trek’s Patrick Stewart and Hey Arnold singing “Can You Take Me Higher?” by Creed seems so out of place for a Paramount+ kids show promotion commercial during a Super Bowl advertising campaign
Advertisements are rarely 100% perfect.  But sometimes... just sometimes, Gurney Halleck dons a 1900's football uniform and throws an animated pre-teen across God's glorious landscape, backed by one of the greatest rock songs of all time.
I think arnold is in odgen utah now
Too much 90s nostalgia in one commercial. Epic🔥🚀
Aside from these commercials paramount is pushing a lot of commercials that parents won’t like. I can’t specify but you can probably guess what and who they are about.
Hey Arnold? In the superbowl?????YES
WHAT DID I JUST SEE
?!🤦‍♀️  0:54
They should've had Sonic already at the top saying you all too slow.
These were the most entertaining commercials
The world most expensive commercial cast.
At the NT was going to th Peppa Pig
Not arnold his parents disappear and he was bully by helga and harold and he got stoop kid off his stoop and his best friend is african American  my man gerald the story teller
This may go down as my favorite Super Bowl commercial of all time
I’ve never watched the Super Bowl in a while.
e/pin
Greatest commercial ever made, argue with a wall.
Not a single commercial this year came close to this gem.
Everything is going to be OK with Sir Patrick Stewart . 🙏
Best super bowl commerical ever.
WHY AM I JUST NOW NOTICING PATRICK STEWART'S FOOTBALL UNIFORM COMES WITH A CAPATAIN'S PATCH? LOL
Best advertisement ever. It’s unfortunate that such good ads go to such a mid service
How are they gonna top this masterpiece this year?
0:25-Basically A Knuckles Thing To Say
Knuckles should NOT have been in this masterpiece commercial. He climbs.........that's why you play Knuckles. SMH
1:11 Higher by Creed
They threw Arnold😳😳😳
"we throw the child"
1:52 “Odie”
Knuckles
One year, you guys should do a Super Bowl commercial with the cast of Jimmy Neutron including Carl & Sheen.
Just imagine explaining to a 90s/2000s kid that Knuckles the Echidna is agreeing with Captain Jean-Luc Picard that he should throw Arnold while Dora the Explorer watches in utter shock. Oh, and Master Chief is just there watching it all happen.
Move it football head ..... Hey Arnold😅
The way that Peppa just says “oh dear.”
*I like to think that Patrick Stewart woke up that morning and said to himself*   Patrick Stewart: "This is Patrick Stewart speaking, and yes today is the day is where I punt Arnold across the glacier like the football head shaped child he is…"
Tua wouldnt be able to even throw a football cuz its cold there
"We throw the child."
This is better rewatching than watching it live lol
PS is a woke shill
😂🏈🐷
This is amazing
This commercial is the only good thing to come out of the streaming era.
This is Satanic symbolism of sacrificing children by throwing them off the mountain face and offering their souls to the Devil. You are all cheering this on
👁️👄👁️ He just threw me high Right into the mountain  I'm good -👍,
Now if we only had someone with pig skin. Peppa at that moment: oh shi-
I only ever saw to when Arnold hit the wall, I never saw that last like 10 seconds, and I about died😂
We throw the child.
Anyone else mishear "to the place where blind men see" as "to the place where linemen sing?
When creed is playing I’m hearing “To the place where Lineman see” 😂
Oh dear
Movie Knuckles by the TV show master chief.
Couldn't knuckles just climb 😂
Miller Charles Williams Elizabeth Harris Linda
the best commercial EVER MADE
Here I am months later going watch this ad, because it is so hilarious. Please never get rid of this ad.
this is awesome
If only you can make a new paramount plus super bowl spot with my son his favorite characters like plankton from SpongeBob SquarePants, rattlesnake jake from Rango movie, Harold humdinger with his uncle from paw patrol mighty pups, swiper the fox from Dora cgi reboot, Megatron from transformer one, Superfly from tmnt mutant mayham and don't forget about shadow the hedgehog from sonic movie 3, my son will call it, the evil plan revenge, can you do that for me and my son to make my son happy and impressed to make his dream come true?, Right?.
Too funny 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wish this ads became tv show
Paramount i question the sanity of you adding these characters                          AND I LOVE THAT SANITY KEEP IT UP BOYS!
When he said someone with pink skin, they mean peppa pig.
I love the detail of Jeff being the only one not wearing winter clothes because he is holding a giant torch to warm himself up
“oh dear”
Knuckles at the end of the video: “Many apologies, small animated pig. The tribe has spoken. Sir Patrick, throw him.”
If there's ever one commercial soup,mcnasty, and blarg needs to be watching with creed in it....this needs to be the one someone needs to send them
Where is sonic where is Lincoln?
I like how patrick stewart kissed arnold... 1:07
They did Arnold dirty
The one thing no one was ever to expect: "Picard and Knuckles wanted to throw the child."
Tua in the cold weather is ironic 😂
"Oh dear". Sorry Peppa. 😥 1:52
Paramount + please make this a series with all characters in it
Yall need Everest to help you climb
Finally my favorite nfl player is in a commercial
Knuckles can legit climb 💀
And Paramount plus please add fang and Balto and talon and and spitz and dolly and pike and Jo and Billie and dub and Dave and solleks and Suki and four spots and gale and Barkley and noodle and bodega, and Chomper and Iggy, and slayer and stilton and fin and Finn and noggin and patriot and Potomac and primrose and poppet and Phil and bolt and aleu and Max and Maia and shorty and shadow and Dewey and Truman and old Jack and Jenna and Ainu and nava and inju and Kodi and Friday and Cooper and Shep and Romeo and Madison and violin and Sebastian and Chelsea and Coco and Rocky and Harley and ginger And Henry and Juliet and Georgette and Lenny and Ariel And Bluey and bingo and Bella and bowe And Rocky and Sheba And Thor And Lola and Rosco and Kahlua and shelby and Oakley and Memphis and Shiloh and snowflake and junean and splkey and Olaf and aurora and scooper and duchess and Mack and diesel and sniff and yodel and demon and Nana and gypsy and Willow and Chico and shi and tango and toko and max.
Oh, and one more thing paramount plus add my dad and mom and all the Huskies and alaskan malamutes and akitas in the commercial
This is weird.  Not in a bad way, though.
I still watch this from time to time. I totally never noticed chief pointing to his grappling hook lol.
Make a Texas Rangers Version!
Run peppa
Oh dear 1:52
0:59 "Its the 5th quarter and we need a hole in one before the 7th inning stretch". Uhh, wrong sport Sir. 😅 Even has the Miami Dolphins player confused. 😂
1:52 Oh, dear😂
Not Built For The Moment I See 👴🏻😏 ❄️🌨🏔🏟🏈👐🏾🧔🏾😰🗑🚮👀
we got Sir Patrick Stewart giving Arnold a kiss on the head while Creed plays before GTA 6
Not built for the moment i see aannd creeds here
The way that Peppa pig said (oh dear) got me rolling
I can't  believe those people was ok of our 90s foot ball headed kid getting yeeted and there going to sacrifice peppa their basically sacrificing each other over a mountain
Months later, and I still keep coming back.  Whoever was mastermind behind this ad is a freaking genius.
Can you guys have Kevin Davis for a new Godzilla movie as the narrator
YES THROW HER SHE'S THE HATER MWAHAHAHAH
"Throw the child"  LOL!!
Knuckles could climb the wall lol
KNUCKLES CAN CLIMB 😂😂😂😂😂
Knuckles 0:20
Paramount.
Plot twist: Tua discovered peppa was a Bills spy
Heard Creed on the radio today. Immediately came home and found this commercial. 😂
I swear I thought this was a movie
Josh Allen would have made that throw
34K to like 9:03-9:04
See this is how you make an ad.
isn't knuckles a hedgehog that can fly and run up walls?
This is pure cinema
Love the Comercial 😂
Absurdist🎉
‘Just like’? What language is that?
I’m I the only one that recognizes the fact that MASTER CHIEF is there and he’s never once let humanity down? He has a literal grapple shot on his wrist.
I wish they can bring Hey Arnold back for real, that would be so awesome.
what is the point of watching this when the knuckles show is already out
I forgot about little Peppa lol
Anyone else come back to  watch this commercial on the regular? Pure perfection. 😂
The way Scott Stapp waves over at them 😭😭😭😭
This commercial lives rent free in my head.
I never thought I’d see the day where Patrick Stewart throws Arnold like an actual football singing “Higher” by CREED with Master Chief, Peppa Pig and Knuckles. This timeline is weird but so cool
Can we officially say that Master Chief has a place in the world of Hey Arnold?
I can’t stop laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Trust me Tua you don’t even got the arm to throw him
I haven't laughed this hard in a long time 🤣 ya need to make more like this.
“Oh dear…”
You know they made possibly the best commercial ever when you see it first in a YouTube pre-roll ad and go search for the video itself because it's legitimately entertaining.
Knuckles could’ve climbed that….
I cheered in front of my brother who adores peppa when Sir Patrick said “now if there were only someone made of pig skin”
They really should’ve thrown Peppa Pig instead
When professor X tells you to throw a child 😮
I feel like Peppa Pig should be like: Since when we’re Soccer Balls of Pigskin because British people don’t play USA Football
That football head of his was almost worthy, Helga Pataki would be proud
That football head of his was worthy
I really hope that there are more Paramount Mountain ads like this in the future. They remind me so much of all those unhinged TV network bumpers that were the norm of the late 90s and early 2000s, like Kids WB, FoxBox/4kids TV, and CN City
0:53 And Creed’s Here
If only the content on Paramount Plus was this entertaining...
Creed ruined this commercial.
Doesn't paramount own Friday the 13th now? If so, make that commercial.
Best commercial ever made 😂
Imagine Helga seeing this. She would have a field day since she always kept calling him "football head".
.💖 Sir Patrick Stewart
...and Creed's here. 😂
That was the best commercial ever even beat the Walter white ones
Throw The Child And Creed Here
Footballhead
Creed is proof that here is no god because it says "ask and you shall receive" and they prayed for musical talent.
Anyone catch Master Chief pointing to his grappling hook? 😂😂😂😂
Poor little Peppa 😂😂😂
Hey Arnold, was a sh*tty cartoon anyway.
Ask the wonder pets to help
Greatest commercial ever!!!
Now go watch Thomas Lennon's interview on Rich Eisen's show about his interactions with Sir Patrick while filming this commercial. 🤣
“Annnnnd Creeds here”
Bro this entire commercial was one giant fever dream
BARRYMORE, SHUT YOUR FACE! 🤣😂 dead
Dangle said on a podcast that Patrick Stewart insulted his legs.
Telling Drew to Shut your face! Made me laugh so hard! I’m always telling people that when they are annoying
Honestly im having a hard time imagining a better commercial existing
This has to be one the best recent commercials
These commercials are better than the streaming services.
TBH, everyone wants to tell Drew Barrymore to shut her face.
"We throw the child"
Do you want an immunity  island , I am dead.😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
If only Stevie could have been there too somehow
Hearing Picard say: “we throw the child” is hilarious
Master Chief pointing at his grappling hook, Knuckles that knows how to climb walls but doesnt, pepa pig being suggested at the end, and Arnold being thrown as an actual football. Loved it lol. Need more chaos like this.
Not my Spartan
Oh he[[😅😅😅'😅😅
Love it
A commenter on Matt Walsh's video brought me here.
I wonder what Helga would have thought?
Tua not built for the moment
I thought my Spotify was playing when I heard Higher playing
Guess Arnold joining the X-Men on account of his Football sized head didn't worked out.
Stewie: Hey Brian u remember that time we went to the multiverse and saw another football shaped headed kid creed knuckles jim dangle from reno 911 master chief and Patrick stewart all in one place Brian: yea....
Im actually disappointed stewie griffin wasnt used in this scene
This is the one ad I love
That fact that Patrick Stewart kisses Arnold and tells him to "Be Brave" before Hail Marying him up a mountain... 🥹🥹🥹... That's my Captain Picard!!!!
Tuaturntheballover
Ranking the best superbowl ads: 1: breaking bad pop its commercial 2: this
01:41 Well I’m glad he said he’s good but that was still a bad idea.
Scott Strapp: Can you take me higher. To a place where blind man see.  Patrick Stewart: I just threw him higher.  Strapp: *after saying "higher" in sync with Stewart* Come on!  Stewart: *in sync with with Strapp's lyrics that fade out somewhere, and some quiet fading out vocals by Drew Barrymore* To a place where we won't freeze.  Me: 20th Century Fox invites you to enter a universe without rules... without laws... without limits. Oh wait! *I say as a record stretch interrupts despite two of Creed themselves(Strapp and Mark Tremonti being the only ones there, though they might've been lip-synching) being there* Wrong company and advert.
Just saw a reference to Creed and immediately had to look this up.
Use the Force Henry!
1:36 when Arnold starts singing and slams into the cliff and says I’m good like nothing happened gets me everytime.
Pip pip hike 😂
Don't throw arnold lol
Can you do one with The Bold and the beautiful character? Their from LA i would love to see how they handle the cold lol
So we just going to ignore Patrick Stewart has a magic Leatherman helmet & wears football gear under his coat? 😂... They would've thrown Stewie but you know copyright stuff
I've watched this 5 times in a row. This has to be one of the best commercials ever!
Why is Arnold here? Is he getting a new show?
Barrymore shut your face!
Okay this ad is gold.
Arnold's dead
I like to imagine Helga in the background panicking after seeing Arnold being thrown
This made Tua more trash 😂
Hey Arnold! You're going to be tossed Arnold! Like a football!
I'm sorry, but this is horrible
Is it crazy that while Master chief is standing there silently trying to point out his grapple hook, knuckles (can literally climb walls) is just like yeah throw him.
“Make it snow!”
Lol °~•.☆.•~°
1:12 Higher🎵🎶
Exellent ad
KNUCKLES!!!!!!!!😃😃😃😃😃😃😃 Anyways what about Throwing stewie griffin up the mountain? His head is football shaped just like arnold
Lower Master Chief could have called a vetol
Why didn't Master Chief try to climb up there
who els wants to see pepe throwin
Paramount is the best!! I watch paramount all the time! More commercials with South Park lol
Why is Master Chief there?
The “oh dear”😂(
Picard:"yeet the kid!!"
This literally needs to be a movie. This is comedy gold lol
Professor X SHUT YER FACE
Kern yer terk meeeeeeeh highyaaa!
This is probably the first time I laughed at something that involved Peppa Pig.
Now I’m waiting for the Creed revival LETS GOOOOOOO
😂😂 "throw him" 😅😅
Knucles: Smart thinkin'!  *Kunckles knowing the fact that he can climb walls.*
Best commercial ever
"He just threw me high-"  *randomly splats against side the of the mountain like a huge ball of SNOT being fired out of a canon*
👏👏🤣👍
Whoever made this commercial has made the best commercial I've seen in my life!!! They all stay in character. Even Scitt Stapp makes fun of himself, Hilarious!!
Nailed it everytime this commercial comes on im like they F ing nailed it the people who made this a real thing deserve a raise and a vacation!! Keep them happy and in the building!!!
The jersey should've had Picard on the back
If the Fortnite movie is not like this i don't want it 🤣😂🤣
This might be the greatest streaming ad ever
Tua wouldn't throw Arnold cuz he can't throw that far
Cruellest thing I've ever seen
If "F them kids" was a commercial 😂. Poor Arnold and Peppa 😂
Crazy how chief wears his helmet here more then he does in the actual show
To be honest I'm not getting paramount+... maybe, but this was pure comedy gold and it will have a billion meme's made after it for years to come... hopefully.
Whoever thought about this, needs a raise in pay, genius 😂
"We throw the child" -Sir Patrick Stewart
THROW PEPPA!!
Stewie  is not the only one with a football for a head 😂
These Paramount Mountain short are simply awesome and hilarious. I love 'em! And I'm glad everyone else does too.
0:19  Knuckles is actually getting his own 6 episode show so that Is why he is there
"Now if there only was someone made of pig skin"  Peppa: *Exits the commercial*
The world is healing.
You're one of the greatest streamers I've ever had. So far, I've having a blast playing TMNT (1987) in your streamer. I also played Back at the Barnyard, MouseHunt, Angry Beavers, Rugrats, Bob the Builder and Little Bear on it.
"HIP HIP HIIIKE”
It’s almost as if the writers ripped this off from an AO3 fanfic written by a writer on shrooms
Whoever made this legit loves their job
I just saw this today for the first time, and it is one of the funniest things I have ever seen 🤣😂 thank you to all the people involved in putting this together.  😅
POOR PEPPA
“CAN YOU TAKE ME HIGHER”
If more commercials were like this, I'd actually watch them😂
Who else was yelling at their screen for them to throw Peppa at the mountain?
this might just be my favorite commercial of all time
This was hands down the best Superbowl commercial. 😆
Wouldn’t they want to get lower down to avoid freezing? Since it’ll get colder they higher up they go?
"Not built for the moment" Tua burn 🤣
This made me laugh a little too much 😂
Hey Arnold is so German or I could be wrong
😱
Master Chief...... Hello.
Only after like my 10th rewatch did I notice Master Chief gesturing to his grappling hook to get up the mountain
Patrick Stewart throws boldly what no one else has ever thrown before
Nothing about this makes sense and that's why it's phenomenal
😢
1:51 NOT PEPPA!!
Needed to put spiral on him lol
Paramount commercial= cure for depression
🎵Can you take me higher🎵To a place where blind man see🎵
Other Companies should strive to be like CBS for CBS is the standard in top quality scripted TVs most engaging News how they present sports but when it comes to reality TV I can't speak for that I don't watch reality TV still that does not take away from the fact they have the highest quality in reality TV regardless of me thinking reality TV is true entertainment or not. That is why I subscribe to Paramount Plus for they bring top notch quality TV over to their streaming service that is why I'm glad Viacom merge with CBS because Viacom goes from having good quality entertainment to the best quality in TV and most engaging news out there.
I like the fact that master chief even points out his grapple hook😂
For some reason when I watch this commercial, it makes me wonder what my younger Hey Arnold loving self would think if given access to watching it then.
best superbowl commercial in the last 10 years easy
Why was Creed in this? Just for laughs? Amazing commerical
He just threw me higher. 😂
This was stuck in my head for eight hours at work.
Tua a better actor than 90% of people in commercials. Guy gets the most out of the smallest facial movements
My favorite Paramount Plus ad to date! 😂
Picard should have contacted the Enterprise to bring everyone up and just flew over the mountain 😂
When watching the super bowl with my family, when this ad popped up and Peppa Pig just said "oh dear," I swear you could hear laughter a mile away.
Arnold's little football helmet is spot on
Next year Patrick Stewart has to have a redemption throw with Pepa yal all paramount please make that happen can be a 2 year tradition
Wait…did any of you see this during the actual Super Bowl? I didn’t. A 2 minute commercial would be like $150m 😂 each 30 seconds is like 50m I think!
This reminds me of ice wall of the firmament
This ad feels like something i would see in my dreams
In my 39 years of living..  this is the best commercial I have ever seen in my life.  Well Done , paramount+ . I'm definitely paying my subscription this month
All the cameos of original character designs 😮 kunkles best  Design
I must admit, nobody can throw Arnold like Patrick Stewart can.
The reason why Arnold was thrown first instead of Peppa was because, Peppa belongs in a kid show that has no violence and Arnold is older then Peppa which that would make sense cause Arnold was already thrown.
Bring back iCarly. I canceled my subscription after it was cancelled 😡
I hope Baby Shark would be in the next Paramount Mountain commercial.
Such a funny awesome commercial! And as a Creed fan (yes I am one), this is awesome to start their comeback.
😂 My new favorite commercial. 😅
Chief pointing at his grapple like “uh guys”
Why couldn’t they get knuckles to climb the mountain and throw the rope to him?
Why didn't Picard ask the Chief  to do it he obviously has the right to qualifications
lol at the Tua diss
This is best fever dream ever! Lol
and I THOUGHT i was immune to superbowl propaganda.  i was wrong
Patrick looks like Mr Burns when he kicks Smithers in the head.
BARRAMORE! SHUT YOUR FACE!!! Had us all rolling on the floor!
Hands down the funniest 2024 Super Bowl commercial🤣 Well done Paramount!
Is this Fortnite?
It makes sense to throw a kid with a football shaped head if you are from the 90s
After seeing that, I would say don’t try this at home. Ever! For any reason!
Drew Barrymore
WAIT A MINUTES WHY COULDN'T KNUCKLES USE HIS FIST SPIKE TO CLIMB HE DID IT IN THE VIDEO GAME BUT WHY COULDNT AT PARAMOUNT +
Best commercial ever
Every time I see this I’m convinced I’m having a fever dream 😂
Peppa Pig😂😂
Why would they do that to Arnold? That's like slamming Denzel Washington through a wall for laughs. He's suppose to be a  loyal and respectable character. Only true Nickelodeon fans will understand that.
Psst hey want a hidden immunity idol?
0:29 what did Jeff tell Arnold?
Barrymore shut your face. Never thought I’d hear that from sir Patrick let alone his version of higher from creed
Best ever!
Did anyone else hear Paramore shut ur face?
"Barrymore, shut your face!"  "And Creed's here..."  Best. Commercial. Ever.
I thought peppa was 7 feet tall
Knuckles you idiot! YOU CAN CLIMB!!
Everything about this commercial is awesome!
This was so Avery Bullock
What If The Really Loud House Or The Original Loud House Would Come To Paramount Mountain?
What If The Loud House Visit Paramount Mountain? That'll Be The Best Commercial In The World!
11/10 commercial
If only they had any field general other than Old Noodle Arm Tagovailoa.
Oh dam
A hole in one before the seventh inning stretch. Either Sir Patrick Stewart needs an education in American Football or the writers do.
Why not give it to Master Chief
Hands down the best commercial.   I bought Paramount for more of these gems and Creed.   It is the 5 th quarter and we need a hole in one?  The next day,  someone said “Par for the court”.   Could not stop laughing.
Now we gotta have a full version of the song with these celebrities.
I love this Picard in him the super bowl commercial
Couldent knuckles just climb up. 😂😂😂
Master chief hey I have a grappling hook and being completely ignored 😂
"It's the fifth quarter, and we need a hole in one, before the seventh inning stretch."  It finally happened, didn't it. Years of Star Trek and X-Men drove Sir Patrick Stewart to become senile.
Why is Creed in the commercial what does that have to do with paramount? Such a random commercial but funny
This is the most coolest thing Paramount has ever done! 🗻🍞👍
During the Super Bowl all I heard was “Barrymore shut your face!!” Lol
This is so good
Peppa knows more than we think
Couldn't stop laughing at this
wut
This feels like a shitpost. I've never been so proud of a marketing company. Good job, Paramount.
I really wish that The Walt Disney Company would sell The Muppets to Viacom, Paramount+ and Nickelodeon since Disney doesn't know what to do with them. The Muppets can make brand new content including (TV Shows, TV Specials, Movies, Crossover/Cameo appearances, merchandise, etc) with them. I would also like to see The Not-Too-Late Show with Elmo with lots of celebrity guest stars from Nick. Also promos, short web videos, and web series on the official YouTube Channels for Nickelodeon, Nick Jr, Sesame Street, The Muppets and The Jim Henson Company ( Jim Henson Company would only post for Fraggle Rock and Emmett Otter's Jug-Band Christmas characters). Including The Muppets, The Not-Too-Late with Elmo, Fraggle Rock and Emmett Otter's Jug-Band Christmas characters should all move to Nickelodeon and Paramount Plus to make brand new projects.
When Arnold started singing 😭😭
I wonder if he ever imagined that his Shakespearean training would take him here
arnold should have just climbed instead of giving a thumbs up, he was almost there...also master chief, do you not have a boost pack to jet up there?
Nah, he aired on Nickelodeon. He'll live.
I wont get paramount + but i love these commercials.
“BARRYMORE! SHUT YOUR FACE!” 🤣
If my mans Knux says throw the child, we throwing the child.
I was wondering why Peppa Pig was a part of Paramount+ but then I realize she was on Nick Junior
creed tied this all together, it's the comeback we all need, summer will be legendary
This is one of the most unhinged commercials I've ever seen. Keep em coming.
Why not have Knuckles throw him he clearly has the arm strength for it 🤣
Mahomes or Allen could make that throw
"Throw the child"
PEPPAS SKIN IS GONNA GET PEELED OFF
My new favorite commercial!
Is there a part 2?  I need to see him throw Peppa
Throwing a child is insane ; I do love the song Higher by Creed
I'd watch this movie 🤣
Wow i actually searched for this gem of an ad, and shared it with my younger sibling lol.
"I just threw him higher, to a place we won't freeze" 😂😂😂
If only they could've had Stewie Griffin they could've succeeded. I mean think about it he's smaller, lighter and has a head shaped like a football. Jk, this commercial is great as is.
its funny master chief wouldve thrown arnold or knuclkes climb but instead we have the former captain of the enterpirse throw the football head boy
Master Chief cant call in a Pelican?
Hey Arnold!! He Picard ! Hey Knuckles! oye Dora!! OI PEPPA !! Hey master chief !  Hey Creed!
This shi is hilarious 😂💀
I truly and genuinely hate how much of my childhood was represented here. Well done.
Never knew Pica...er, Sir Patrick was a southpaw 😊🏈
“I just throw him higher”
master chief would've been able to throw the rope up there no problem
Imagine if they finished the song.. failure
I absolutely lovvvvvve this commercial
Poor pepa 1:52
ARNOLD
One of my personal favorites
0:19  WHEN DID KNUCKLES CAME HERE?!?!
ITS KNUCKLES 0:26
That was great!
I cant believe Patrick Stewart really threw Arnold into the air like that.  and is that really Creed i thought the guy had long blond hair just like Arnold?
I just have to say, this is how ads should be made
Oh dear ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha😂😂😂😂😂
It's like Paramount's Avengers Endgame. Love it
jeff probst standing between arnold and peppa pig is something i can never unsee and i am beyond thankful for that
When Tua said he's not gonna throw a kid Patrick should've said "make it so number one!"
Not papa what about there family she’s only a kid
Best SuperBowl Commercial ever 10/10
rest in peace peppa pig
of all rock bands why creed lol
Hey Arnold!
Arrrrrrrrrnoldddd
"It's the 5th quarter, and we need a hole in one before the 7th inning stretch!"
lol
"And theres creed"
The fact that Arnold’s voice still sounds exactly how it did in 1996 is amazing
Good commercial, but based on the characters, I have no reason to get paramount+..
“We throw the child” will forever be referenced by me
Now, this would make me subscribe.
If stewie was there, he could be a perfect candidate to throw
Not peppa being there lol
This is amazing.
Oh dear...           Peppa pig 2024
Lol even Jeff from Survivor is there.
I dont know what i just watched and i really really dont want to know?
I'm sorry but I got starstruck didn't pay attention but you don't use children to do dangerous things 😔
*giggling
Cadiccarus is going to live that ending.
Masterchief over there, fully able to scale the cliff with minimal effort, "nah".
Legit thought that was pigeon man 😂
I was sold with Creed
I canceled my Paramount+ Subscription after they stop providing past Serie A and Champion’s League matches. Unbelievable. That was one of its best features.
Best one of the SB... Sorry but this one was great!
Oh dear... HAHAHA
What happened to Dora dawg-
May b the best commercial I’ve ever seen
Shut your face
You can throw Arnold but don't hurt him by tossing him on the mountain
First time I didn't skip a commercial 😂
Dangle is wearing the boots from the “new boot goofin scene.”
This feels like a fever dream...AND I LOVE IT!!! "Oh dear." 😅
"Barrymore shut your face!" 😂🤣
🥎🏀⚾️
😇😅🤣😂🥰
How do you know that the world 🗺 is not the way
swiftys be watching Hey Arnold now, supported by nick and nike all together as one, nikelodean, it all makes sense now
Man really said YEET
Omg the funniest thing ever
“We throw the child” - Sir Patrick Stewart 2024
0:42 sir Patrick saying “ not built for the moment “ to tua got me bc of the dolphins not making the super bowl
Hilarious! Made me think of when things were actually funny. Replace everything done in the past 15 years with this stuff, please....
At least Tua is smart not to throw a kid in the air unlike Hancock who purposely did it or would even think about it in the first place if Arnold called him something bad😆. Also, I met the QB, and he did seem to be a humble good person on my team. On another note, Tua probably learned from how Will Smith’s actions on assault cost him his job in the real world.
That not built for the moment I see at 0:41 gonna go Triple Platinum on sports twitter
This is why Paramount is the best at crossovers.... When we will get a "All Paramount Mountain commercials" compilation? Greets from Salem, NJ (CBS affiliate: KYW 3, Philadelphia, PA.)
Wow, They are twin. I can't tell the different.
Most hilarious superbowl ad I've seen. So awesome to see Hey Arnold get some love!
They did Arnold dirty
This is the absolute best commercial for this year's Super Bowl. 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆. If I didn't already have a subscription to paramount, I would purchase one on the merits of this commercial alone. 😅😅😅
Ok... This ad was almost good enough to make me want to sub to Paramount+.
<><>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>>>>> A man named Jesus forgave us of all wrongs. He's the son of God. God is the created of everything in this existence. Breathe air. To life.
Everyone: Throw the Child  Bills Mafia: Throw the Pig
THAT....WAS.....AWESOME!!!!!
God I love America
The best commercial I think I have ever seen 😂
C'mon Paramount....make this show happen! I'll gladly pay up to 60 bucks a month just to watch it. The football-shaped head is in your court.
Would've made more sense if they didn't have Knuckles and Master Chief there with them.
The fact that these characters are stuck together, arguing, while forced into a survival situation by Paramount, wherein they are literally trapped on the company logo...  *There is no subtext here.*  "I know writers who use subtext, and they're all cowards!" - Garth Marenghi
Knuckles is TROLLING BIG TIME!!!
I just changed the world 🌍
creed for superbowl please
Missed opportunity to have that full line be "Barrymore, shut your face you dirty scab!"
I wonder was the commercial made before or after Tua game vs the Chiefs.
Ok, Best commercial from Super Bowl hands down and its not close I give it a 9.5.
These are probably my favorite commercials of all time
Jim Dangle from Reno 911???! 🙃🙃🙃🤣🤣
Why doesn't Knuckles just climb it? Duh
I've had dreams like this
This is hilarious😂
"Hey Arnold!" was my favorite show as a child.
"Throw the Child" got to be the funniest line I ever heard, and they just throwing two children, Arnold, and pepper pig, they abusing children rn! ☠️
Best commercial 👌
the tribe has spoken, Arnold
1:42-Hey Arnold, Ya Missed
"not built for the moment I see" will be a phrase I adopt to my vocabulary
did  i just watch a commerical on a show and come to youtube to find it ? yes, yes i did! HEY! Arnold you should have took the immunity idol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
and Creed's here.
Rip Peppa Pig. She will be missed until the new season of Bluey comes out 😔
Knuckles you can climb walls
They need a comedy with sir patrick stewart being the same character as in this commercial
Or you could just use master cheeks grapple hook?!?!?!?!?
“We throw the child” 💀
Of all the Super Bowl commercials, this one was the best.
Dangit Paramount...I actually love these dumb ads.
#1 yes!!
0:21
Hey Chief has his helmet on!
Let’s be real, this isn’t the worst Arnold’s been through. He’s seen better days.
So your telling me that Knuckles ( who has the ability to CLIMB UP ANY SOLID SURFACE ) couldn't just...climb???
Make a series or movie crossover  I would love to see it
Knuckles can climb, yet he demands to yeet the child.
Most important lesson...83 year old Patrick Stewart has a stronger arm then Tua...lol
Hey Arnold!, Creed, and Peppa Pig are three things I’d never thought I’d see on one commercial!
man Picard is looking old
Average fort match
😂😂😂😂😂the irony is Paramount just sent 800 former employees into this spot. CNBC: Paramount Global lays off about 800 employees, a day after announcing record Super Bowl ratings
Seeing the distinguished and classy Patrick Stewart whip his head around with "Barrymore, shut your FACE!" was the funniest 2 seconds of the evening.
100% missed opportunity not having Snoop Dogg come out an say oh I can get us all high enough baybayyy 😩
I love his play sheet on his wrist “throw the child”
1:52 This would be a good time for Peppa to start running.
if only all there shows had this effort I would sub today.
Patrick Stewart is an international treasure.
Patrick Stewart channeling his American Dad comedy chops, and it's brilliant!
So... is Hey Arnold making a comeback?
This is my favorite Superbowl commercial 😂
who voices arnold here?
The only add that made me want to spend money on them. Chefs kiss!
Hahaha we need more sarcasm
I lost it when patrick threw arnold 😂😂 it was hilarious 😂
100% going to still pirate your library but absolutely amazing commercial!
My favorite ad for this superbowl 2024. This is absolutely hilarious. 😂
This was cute. I had to come back and watch again
y'know maybe consumerism ain't so bad
Bro why didn’t they just get chief to throw him
Is Hey Arnold Famous again?
Bravo 👏🏽
This is so much meme potential right here.
AND Creed is here LOL
Yeah, this makes me want to buy the ads product. I cant believe i said that and meant it. Lolololol
Oh dear 😂
I love this commercial! Wow! Well done! Wow!
This is hilarious 😂
They know that Knuckles can glide and climb, right?🤣🤣🤣
I’m Loving this commercial 😅😅
Gold, amazing and I just can’t pick what was my favorite. I wanna share this with everyone but Ik we all saw it😂😂😂😂
Arnold, The Tribe has spoken. You’ve been evicted from Paramount Mountain.
The peace Arnold must’ve felt during that kiss…
This entire thing hinges on the best line: "Shut your face, Barrymore!!"
the return of peppa pig
Primer  anuncio que me encanta ami porque fastidian los anuncio ahoy en día pero este anuncio me iso el dia😂😂😂😂
Long live creed.
These commercials are super Smash bros level of greatness
I don’t know why but I find to so funny for peppa pig to be in the past 2 paramount mountain adds
Next Fortnite Season looks tight.
Best commercial ever made hands down.
1:11 the song starts
😂😂😂😂
Best Superbowl ads hands down,
Sir Patrick Stewart: Now if there were only someone made of pig skin. Sheriff: Bingo. Peppa: ...Oh dear........
this is actually the weirdest ad i’ve ever seen 😭
Jean Luc Picard and Arnold! Two of My Childhood Icons!
They need to make this a show all the characters in one.
Is it odd that this is the best written thing on Paramount+?
Is it just me or does Paramount just need to make a miniseries focusing on these characters all interacting 😂
Captain Picard telling Barrymore to "Shut her face" 😅😅😅. Priceless.
Anybody ever notice that the Master Chief definitely could’ve yeeted the kid over the ledge, much less climb up there with the rope and pulled everybody up?
they did peppa so dirty like why 😂
They did Arnold dirty omg
Did Creed just reference their shreds videos with that "comeown"?!
Why didn’t this play so much on SBS? Wish it did instead of the Josh Allen one on repeat.
This is excellent commercial 😂.
Knuckles don’t encourage him!
My 7 & 2 year olds can’t get enough to this commercial. Well played Paramount, well played. If anyone from the company actually reads these: We already subscribed months ago to watch South Park. The kids love all the Paw Patrol movies too.
This ad seems to forget that Knuckles can climb up walls lol!
Why can't I stop laughing at this
Best commercial ever!!
1:19 Arnold’s reflection in Master Chief’s visor while Creed plays in the background made me cry laughing
funny stuff, still not getting your service
i love this ad so funny
This is ENTERTAINMENT!! ❤❤❤
The best add ever
The "oh dear" from peppa pig was funny.
Very funny Commercial I love it!!!!!😂😂
Funny how it looks like none of them were in the same room recording
If anything, why didn't they have Master Chief throw Arnold or Peppa? If there's one guy there who can literally throw far. It's the super soldier Spartan.
Gotta be the most cringey commercial of all time. But since they thru some icons in there you all will swallow it down. Sad.
CREED IS BACK!!!
The group could have used Master Chief to get up there with the rope; not sure why they didn't think to use his skills, especially since he is a SPARTAN.........lol
Now I have this song in my head. And I love it. Thank you Paramount+, Sir Patrick Stewart, Creed, Arnold From Hey Arnold.
I think Knuckles just wanted Arnold to get yeeted for kicks.
I feel like i just woke up from a fever dream and am somehow disappointed
0:21 Chief just silently pointing at the Grappleshot in his wrist
“Aaand Creed’s here.”   Excellent delivery of the line 😂
The MVP super bowl commercial
This is amazing 😅🥰
1:53 It's for the greater good Peppa
My favorite part is when he tells her "shut you're face." 😅 I was like yesss we are all done with her too lol.
Knuckles saying throw him when he can climb the mountain 😂
Imagine if Helga saw this. 😂
This made me laugh.  Should have been a top choice. And the app that assists the blind in taking picture.  GENIUS!
Sir Patrick kissing Arnold's forehead and telling him to be brave is oddly inspiring.
this is incredible commercial
JEFF PROBST TALKING TO ARNOLD OH MY GOD 🥹🥹🥹
LOL I hope this revives the band Creed, one of my favorites!!! 👍🏼👍🏼
This was my absolute favorite commercial!
We need a commercial with Puka Nacua now!
It's the fifth quarter.....LOL. Not a creed fan but this was pretty hilarious.
Buffoons
Si funny video😂 love it
😂
Pepa pig NO!😮😢
The Survivor guy asking Arnold if he wants an immunity idol 😭
I about hit the floor dying in laughter!!! This was probably the best commercial of the entire Superbowl.
So, just "throwing" this out there, but Knuckles could've easily thrown Arnold over the mountain.  Heck, he could've easily climbed to the top with the rope and let the rope down.  ... But then again, Patrick Stewart *is* Patrick Stewart.
"BARRY-MORE SHUT YOUR FACE!"  ...Quote of the year right there.
Sir Patrick, throwback football uni...throw the child
I’m just more shocked how it’s theoretically canon that Peppa Pig is in the Sonic universe now
"BARRYMORE, SHUT YOUR FACE"!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
If only the app worked well for streaming. It constantly crashes when going to the next episode
You know what it been years when arnold as a football (it's very funny plus next pepa be getting throw next)
This is brilliant.  The 7th inning stretch is here.  Go Creed Go.
Omg! This is so epic! Patrick Stewart threw Arnold! And Creed hooked it up! Now this is an easy fix! Have Knuckles climb up the mountain,grab Arnold and the rope And go over to the other side with them. Then there is no need to throw Pepa! Also,Chief, what are YOU doing?! I know it's been a while sence your last campaign, but you could help them get over too!😡
Hey Arnold is one of the greatest shows of all time. It stands the test of time with adults who loved in then growing up and love it now along with new generations. It has the right amount of maturity and substance to be very fun and interesting with the stories and very likable, memorable characters that it just is always a winner. Please bring on new seasons!!! ❤️
Best commercial ever
“If only there was someone made of pig skin”  Peppa: Oh Dear…
they did Arnold dirty
The only part that made me laugh was the awkward 2D-irl interaction animation in the middle of throwing a child
How do I subscribe twice?
Boring
The joke of using Peppa after Arnold’s failed cracked me up so hard! 😂
Arnold knows how Eugene feels now.
awesome
Blud kissed a random kid..   Just so u know ..ik some ppl kiss the ball for good luck calm down I said it as a joke
This was the only Super Bowl commercial that was actually funny. 😂😂😂
The “ barrymore shut your face” Line had lauhing for days. Sir Patrick always the goat
never planning on paying for anything paramount does. ever again.
Patrick Stewart is just amazing lol
There are very few commercials that make me genuinely laugh out loud. This is a gem.
I don't know what is going on, but I want this to be made into a show. Genius
Lol poor Arnold not even thrown the right way. xD 🔥
Lol ❤😂😊😊😊!
Is it me or does tua sound just like tom brady?
That’s funny
This the funniest dam commercial!! 😆 🤣 😂
TUA FINS UP 🐬🆙 305 DADE COUNTY
I played enough sonic games to know knuckles should have no problem climbing up there
Stop it! The tribe has spoken! Haha
Guttsy move Mr. Sir Patrick.
Best ad of the year def
Arnold is the man. As a kid who grew up in NY loved watching his cartoon.
Best Super Bowl commercial in years
What even was this 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hilarious, especially the part at the end 😂
Trivia: That sound when Picard throws the child is the sound from the old Bionic Woman and Bionic Man tv series. It would play when they did bionic moves.
This is the first Superbowl commercial I ever liked, because it genuinely made me laugh.
So cool 😎 so cute ☺️
This commercial 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I have never laughed at Peppa Pig, but that "Oh dear" at the end really got me for some reason.
so Picard is off. Why is Patrick in this commercial?
Great ad! I'm a '90s dad who got to laugh with my teenage daughter
Just a little higher 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This was great 😂😂
😂
Are we gonna skip over Sir Patrick saying we need something made of pigskin and the camera cuts to lt dangle??? And then Peppa pig going oh dear??? Peppa pig gets it. And it is hilarious!!!
The best commercial ever
Best commercial ever!!
Um are we just not going to talk about the fact that knuckles can climb walls? I mean the heck he there for?
If they made a full crossover show similar to this I’d pay to watch it.
Probably would've made it if he threw stewie griffin,
Morally bankrupt
Never in a million years would I have imagined Arnold and Knuckles The Echidna in a Commercial together. My childhood 😭✨
Knuckles can literally just… climb up there 😂
Paramount please keep making these 😂
Good grief, you guys don’t get the real issue. How sad. You should pray.
Haha the very subtle joke about Tua not being “built for the moment” funny AF!! I guess Dr.X knows something in his subconscious!! 🤣
It's a shame that all these beloved characters are controlled by a woke company. And Patrick stewart, what a fall from grace.
Am I the only one that thought to themselves "Knuckles can literally climb walls?"
Perhaps like Eugene, Arnold may be a jinx. Also, I never knew Sir Patrick Stewart was left handed. Cool.
HOW DARE THEY..PEPPA RUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!
I would've loved to see Patrick Stewart Yeet Peppa Pig over the mountain that would be funny AF
Creed performed at half time after that national tragedy 9/11
New boot goofin
By far the best Super Bowl commercial of the year!
“I could easily toss that grappling hook or jump up to the edge of the cliff, but i’m curious to see how this plays,” - Master Chief, probably
The need Chase form the PAW Patrol to use his winch!
Should have gotten Uncle Rico.  He'll throw it over the  mountains.
"We throw the child."
It’s disappointing they showed the short version of this during the SB. The SB cut missed all that made this great
“And Creeds here.”  LOL. Heck yeah they are!!! 💥
I like this commercial. Odd and perfect.
Josh Allen would have thrown the rope up there.
That was amazing. Creed made it perfect 😂
Can we get a full mini series with this whole cast? 😂
The shortened commercial did not do the long form justice at all!
Was able to see the full advertisement before the Super Bowl. Everyone seriously made it harder than it is. Have they not thought that Knuckles can climb walls? Doing that, the rope would be on top easy and everyone would make it up
Didn't air on Nick's version.  The CBS version was short.  It didn't deserve this, it was so much fun.
This was the best one by far
I Saw this on the Scott Stapp fan page and I am so glad I found it it is so funny!
lol
The oh dear at the end 😂😂😂😂😂
Freaking beautiful. 🥲🥲🥲
"it's the 5th quarter, and we need a hole-in-one before the 7th inning stretch"
I just threw him higher 😂
that Oh dear from peppa pig is FUNNY
Helga's reaction: MY BELOVED 😱😱😱
You can't watch this and seriously tell me the people who came up with it were sober.
Does this mean our favorite 90's kid is coming back? 🏈
Only ad that actually made me laugh. Patrick Stewart was on one 😂
This was the best commercial in decades 🤣
is it just me or did they not show this during the superbowl
Imagine Stuart saying, "If only there's a "four-headed coral".
disappointed that it was cut short during the supperbowl
Knuckles can just climb the wall lol
👏👏👏👏👏
A great promo commercial. Millennial approved.
Uh oh this is a bad idea
MY  SURE BET   FOR PARAMOUNT PLUS  : IS THAT THEY GO BANK RUPT FOR MILLION OF OUTAGES DURING SUPER BOWL 58 !!!!
Yeah they deserve my money.
This is the best commercial I have seen in years!!!!!!
😂😂😂
Best yet.
Do you think that Dangle should have a spinoff?
I love how Peppa says “Oh dear”  I laughed so hard when they wanted to throw peppa lol 😂
The reason they didn't throw Pepa is because her audience is still kids 💀
the Spartan could have climbed up their in a matter of seconds. what's wrong with this picture? couldnt numba one beam up Picard to the top? his crew can literally transport anyone to anywhere from space.
If they wanted a football head kid they could’ve use Stewie from family guy😂😂😂
The end was uncalled for
YEETUS THAT PIGGUS
Yo where Helga at? She’ll get Arnold to the top of the mountain.
If this was a 90s kid who wrote this who ever it was they need a raise
1:39
Knuckles is no restraints unhinged
Do not tell Drew Barrymore to shut her face
Am I on drugs?
Everyone else: How are we gonna get up that cliff?  Knuckles, a character literally known for climbing: How, indeed.
He just threw me hii.. *splat*
No... way! Knuckles on Paramount Mountain?
The way Creed just materializes out of nowhere in order to provide the inspirational music.  "And Creed's here."
I popped for Arnold.
Helga G. Pataki “Well Patrick, you throw my beloved and cause him to get hurt. Now you have to answer the old Betsy, and the five avengers.“  Patrick Star: “but I didn’t throw anything.“  Helga G. Pataki: “not you, you idiot! Patrick Stewart! Now buzz off before I sick my fists on you too!”  Patrick Star: “OK“  (Patrick leaves, as Helga rubs her hands with a sinister grin on her face, planning to get revenge on Sir Patrick Stewart, for throwing her beloved Arnold, and getting him put in the hospital for two weeks.)
Tua not built for the moment lol
One of the best commercials ever!!!!!!
i love the Oh dear
I was not expecting Mark Tremonti in a SB commercial \m/
A yes, the early 2000’s. Good f*cking times.☺️👍
Patrick Stewart is probably one of the best actors to ever live. He knows not to judge a project by it's cover.
I can’t believe, they shot this beautiful commercial-one of the best SB commercials I’ve ever seen…only for their own parent company to cut out half of it live…
YEAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH CREEEEEEEEEEED 💯🤟🤟💯💯😎😱😱😱😎💯🤟😱😎💯
i grew up with hey arnold that was not right yall rong for that🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So far…. Best one.   I loved this!!
BARRYMORE! SHUT YOUR FACE
Funniest commercial I've ever seen!
Who is the cop dude?
THE WAY PEPA SAID OH DEAR I CANT 😭😭😭
Arnold didn’t deserve this.
"oh dip" got me dead
Bro they all targeted peppa and arnold
We’re living in a simulation.
I'm dying 😂
We throw the child😂😂😂😂😂
The Super Bowl version being cut down was a disappointment.
Picard: “We should throw this child to reach to the top of the mountain.”  Knuckles, whose main ability is climbing: “Good idea.”
Im so glad this was leaked. Bc the short commercial version was trash compared to this
I just remembered   Knuckles can climb
😮❤❤
Lol it was just on
If he had thrown Peppa into the side of the mountain, this would’ve been a 10/10 ad.
Something tells me that Helga might get angry at Patrick Stewart for throwing Arnold
Peppas "oh dear" 💀💀💀🤣
Has to be the best commercial ever dude
The Super Bowl stream on Paramount sucks !!! Keeps freezing every 5 seconds !!!
I Love when Paramount Does These Crossover commercials!
dude, poor Arnold
Bought the sub to watch Super Bowl but the live doesn’t work
Bro knuckles can climb 💀
Knuckles can easily scale that rockface, I don't know why they're bothering to throw Arnold.
1:53 had me dieing
Who are all the cartoon characters in this? I think I counted four.
Now all i need is a sonic character and any transformer in the same scene cause thats the closest I'll get to them interacting with each other
The millennial in me is crying happy tears 😂😂😂😂😂
If only there was someone with access to transporter technology, right Sir Patrick?  🙃
Chief could've made it
Missed opportunity to add "and Knuckles" to the video title
We’ve watched this too many times and feel like he might make it every time.
*OH DEAR*
Is that the intro to Creed's... "and Creed's here."  Oh. Wow, they...yeah, it is.
Shots fired at Tua lol
Lol😂 this is insane
I liked it when Drew Barrymore was told to shut up. Serves her right, the scab.
child sacrifice
Throw everything at the wall, and see what sticks. This one is sticking around for a while.
Written for and by 90s kids no doubt. I approve.
anyone else surprised to see mark tremonti ? I thought the alter bridge guys dont like scott anymore
27 years of asking and we know, Arnold would not make a great football. That or you need to have a real good throwing arm to do it.
Love it awesome the comeback of creed is super awesome ⚜️⚜️⚜️
Hahahahahahaha😂😂😂
Ima need that Sir Patrick throwback jersey from Mitchell & Ness ASAP, please.
Knuckles-coming soon
❤
Dude this just won the internet. I’m going g to bed lol
Arnold's finally wearing that "football head" nickname with pride 🫡🫡🫡🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈🏈
Knuckles could have scaled the wall in seconds.
BRING BACK HEY ARNOLD
Ehhh...I don't like them using Sir Patrick Stewart that way. Whoever came up with this ad has a bad sense of humor.
Missed a good opportunity to have uncle Rico from napoleon dynamite say "i bet you i could throw a football over them mountains"
The merge...it's happening!
Brilliant!
“We throw the child”  Couldn’t agree more…
Just have Master Chief throw in.   🙄
It’s defiantly Patrick Stewart’s director bullock showing in this cause I can definitely see him doing that to a kid in the show lol
Imagine if he threw Arnold with a perfect spiral
Wow Arnold gets thrown like a football!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Solution: Use Knuckles, he can climb that thing. Tie a rope around him. Have him climb up and he can also send said rope down for them to climb.
Pure poetry in action here. 😂
Theres no such thing as a perfect commerc... Oh.    There is.
Nobody's comparing Picard in that coat to the Ikea monkey?
This is a masterpiece
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen
One of the few ads that I have legitimately come back to re-watch. Crazy. "SHUT YOUR FACE BARRYMORE"
What on earth did I just watch 😂🤣😂🤣
One of the best commercials I’ve seen in a long time.
Sir Patrick Stewart can do no wrong!! I’m ded
This is truly epic! Best commercial ever!
NOT PEPPA 😭😭😭
PEAK because of Creed
This is gold I can’t stop laughing 😂
love this so much let’s go CREED
Jon taffer should've been in this too 💁
Patrick Stewart is a gift to mankind.
Holy EPIC commercial!! What just happened! Chills!! And Creed!!
Everyone who worked on this understood the assignment
I'll never buy Paramount Plus but I'll admit that was a great commercial.
"oh dear" 🥓
Professor X done threw Arnold!!  PR team needs a raise
Tua can’t throw in the cold
Best commercial ever!
Number one go to play..." Throw the Child" ROLMAO
Peppa : oh dear. Me: this is how I would think it would go down. Knuckles: I have more strength than all of you, let me throw her. peppa: wait, you can’t do that I’m just a kid throw George I’ll go get him stay right here. Everybody: that will take forever throw her Now knuckles. also peppa: um I think I need to feed my fish. Knuckles: *kicks peppa like Charlie Brown trying to kick a football*                                                                                              THE END
I’ve never seen a better commercial.
Shoulda had Master Chief throw him lol
Can somebody please tell me who the actor that plays the sherriff is and what show hes in?!?
These are the greatest commercials ever
Hey Nux, once up there, can you get me a chaos emerald? The best - Rouge ;)
What if it was a Hello Panda commercial?
Knuckles, climbing walls was literally your signature ability in Sonic 3
why is this so good
1:52 O h d a n g
You know it’s a good idea when Knuckles agrees
These commercials are funny and all but wouldn’t it be amazing if Paramount spent some of this money fixing their horrendous app ?
This is the best ad I’ve seen in literal years 😂
I want a shirt with Sir Patrick Stewart telling “Barrymore” to shut her face.
Poor Peppa.
My grandkids now sing..."he just threw me higher...smack" lol
Arnold: *exists*  Knuckles: *F O O T B A L L*
Is peppa going to be thrown next?
And creed's here... that wins the internet this week..
Drew Barry is still so pretty and sexy one of my favorite child hood actresses
No one is going to point out he Threw off his back foot...
I'm not sure what I just watched, but I love it 🤣
😂😂😂😂😂
What does Paramount have against children, ageless children at that?
Only if Stewie Griffin was here.
Smart thinking
Throw him
I have that song in my Playlist
Of course Knuckles was the first one to suggest tossing Arnold.
This is great!Be brave (little toaster)
This commercial just made me pull out my Creed CD.
Wonder if Bloom's gonna climb the Mountain
Bro now that's just wrong
Like I know it’s just a soulless corporation trying to be weird and random to get attention, but him opening his play guide and it just says “Throw the child” is literally one of the funniest things I’ve ever scene like I’ve been thinking about it for a week now.
I love this 😂
Change the title to say HEY Arnold. Not HAIL(???) Arnold, you degenerates.
Whoever wrote this undoubtedly must have been a 90’s kid and I am so proud 😭
CAN YOU TAKE ME HIGHER?
Sir Patrick throws the child for the win!
BRO THREW A KID AT WHAT!?
honestly, paramount, well done
Thanks i hate it.
This is great
This commercial changed my whole outlook on life. I AM ENOUGH!!
Why's Drew Barrymore here?  Don't elevate scabs.
Always in for Patrick Stewart, but Dangle!!!!!!!!   Excellent!!!!  💗
Cerberus brought back Shepard to save the galaxy but Capitalism brought back Professor X to sell you netflix
He kissed Arnolds head 💀
whoever came out with this is a genius
I feel like this should be a family guy cutaway
2024 is gonna be wild
LOL
WTH does Tua have a commercial???  CBS should only be heavily pushing Allen, Mahomes, Burrow and a small smattering of LJ.  Never should Tua has a commercial.  Do better Paramount/CBS
1:08 Joe Biden when he sees an 11 year old girl sitting all alone👃🏼
This is actually hilarious. Paramount kinda been killing it in the marketing game.
01:11
Omg ❤ Hey Arnold!!
Going to see creed this year cant beleive theyre back for real
This is great!!! 😂 Best one so far
Cortana: _”Hey Chief? Shouldn’t we tell them we could have the UNSC deploy a pelican for us at our location?”_  Master Chief: _”Wait…I wanna see how this plays out.”_
I could have done without Creed though
0:21 Knuckles: Smart thinking
this is actually funny! I love to see Arnold acknowledged  :)
LOL what an amazing commercial
I love how the only play on his worn out old play sheet is “throw the child”
Looks like Knuckles forgot that he’s very good at climbing.
Barrymore shut your face! 😅
That is a $28 million dollar commercial?  I won't be purchasing paramount...
I loved watching this...EPIC
Why wouldnt knockels use his climbing ability.  Major plot hole
“ If there was someone made of Pig skin “ ….. “ Oh dear “.   💀
Hegla wouldve f'd him up
This mixture of random pop culture characters makes it feel like Smash Bros. If we were on Smash Bros. 9
Why
this might be the best commercial ever
Chief awkwardly showing his grappling hook is killing me lol
Knuckles can climb that mountain like nothing and just lower the rope to them 😂 also Master Chief being ignored with his Grappling hook is hilarious.
When Professor Xavier questions your gumption, you know ya messed up. 😂😂😂
Poor Peppa Pig
This should've been a 2024 superbowl commercial. Poor Arnold. He just threw me higher and then i hit face plant to the wall.
Captain Picard tells you to throw the child you throw the child
poor peppa blud
CREED is amazing and them being in this commercial will hopefully bring back the love and popularity that CREED definitely deserves.  We can take them " HIGHER".
I love how Arnold is just okay with this
This is totally random but, what does Creed have to do with Paramount Plus? This ad is hilarious!
Dude from Reno 911 lol
😂😂😂😂
i've watched this at least a dozen times! it's fricken HILARIOUS! my favorite part is when patrick steward starts singing in the clouds 😂😂😂
Built by a kid from the '90s for a kid from the '90s. Probably my favorite commercial I've ever seen
The creed tattoo
"He just threw me high-" *splat
I don't wanna encourage advertiosing, but when so many people put so much love into something, I can't help but be impressed.
Paramount make the most wild videos, this is how marketing is done people
CAN YOU TAKE ME HIGHER
Best commercial of the year, don't even need to see the rest. What a great job paramount
I laughed so hard when they all looked at peppa pig with bad intentions
1:31
This is the single greatest ad I’ve ever seen.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love how chill arnold is about this.  Totally in character.
When I hear his voice l think American Dad
1:52 peppa you next 😂
Awesome lol
I love how Chief is Just sitting there like 😐
The best part about this ad, is that Arnold is 100% complying with a bunch of strangers throwing his head like a foot ball 😅
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
Thinking about it now, the slow motion might not actually be normal motion at all, though it's acting like it. I'm thinking of a scenario in which this could be viewed as an exaggerated and carefully-acted recreation compared to "what really happened".
Seeing arnold after so long felt so good, just was sad to see the poor guy get hurt haha
These paramount plus commercials literally are amazing!
Wait there's a new season of hey Arnold
Tua did amazing job on this.    Football players aren't expected to act, but he did really well.
1 like 1 prey for pepa
"Oh Dea' " 😂😂😂😂 RUN PEP, RUUUUNNNNN!!!!😂😂
Wow, an actually funny commercial. Hope no snowflakes find a way to be offended.
they know what the people want XD
That’s amazing. A Super Bowl Spot on a mountain. This is definitely a Great Commercial for sure. But I kind of liked Mountain Survival Skills Better. Nah! I Like it the Same as this.
I mean you have the Master Chief there think he may be able to scale that no problem. He's done it enough in the games
My dad is a big fan of Survivor, so seeing the Host just there with the rest of the gang holding a torch is just funny to see
The only reason Arnold was okay is because he remembered to put a helmet on!
THIS IS THE BEST COMMERCIAL TO EVER EXIST 😭
That shot at Tua was great! Not built for the moment! 😂😂😂
Knuckles can climb mountains just ask him 😂😂😂
😂😂😂 👍👍👍🤘🤟🤟
Can we please have a series of this?
Honestly, I really enjoy these commercials. These silly cross overs are actually really nice lol
Man, Peppa Pig keeps catching strays
hes following pigeon man
That was pretty horrifying…
Picard wants to throw Arnold from the cartoon Hey Arnold at a mountain while Master Chief from the hit video game Halo and Knuckles The Echidna from the hit video game Sonic 3 watch.
Bro, Master Chief could've chucked that child to the moon
"Don't kick the baby" -Ike probably (allegedly)
Barrymore shut your face 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
if only they could have got Arnolds og voice actor
The decision to go completely unhinged with this was 😔👌
This was hilarious  Very well written
This is my Infinity War 😌
Everyone's talking about Picard, Knuckles and Arnold but I'm more surprised to see Lieutenant Dangle here!
Dangle still rockin’ the short-shorts.
Better commercials. Slower load times.  Paramount Plus
Shut your face Barrymore! I am deceased. 😆😆😆
Hey Arnold was one of my fav cartoons as a kid and seeing this cracked me up! Great ad 👏
Gonna be tough for anything to top this one. Leader in the clubhouse for Super Bowl 58
Arnold closing his eyes for that kiss. Perfect
I'm almost positive I had a fever dream like this once.
We need more like this
I keep forgetting Drew Barrymore has a whole morning show thing. Really çan only remeber her for getting brutally murdred in the opening of scream l😅
Best commercial ever
That is a lot of Nickelodeon and Nick. Jr characters and Peppa Pig is in this crossover too! I like it 😂😊😯
Missing beavis and butthead
I see Patrick Stewart...all i hear is Avery Bullock.
I miss the days when the Superbowl commercials were actually a surprise during the game.
After being called football head for years, he finally reached his full potential
That was one of the best commercials I've seen in a long time.😅  oh ! And I still can't stand Creed !!😂
It's Hey Arnold.
Helga would have actually made it.
"Barrymore, SHUT YOUR FACE!"  Lol
Okay paramount, you win.. I'll sign up again
Patrick Stewart is a gift to mankind.
This was a far better send off to Hey Arnold than the jungle movie
Patrick Stewart can throw higher higher than tua bro😂
The fact that Master Chief pointed at his grapple hook and everyone ignored him...
1:49 KNUCKLES SHOW CONFIRMED AT THE BOTTOM
Now if only the streaming service matched the quality of the commercial. Too many, need some services to die out.
This is funny. Pretty cool...
Leave Peppa alone
Is Creed now only two people?
This was a huge throwback
KNOCK KNOCK 🔴🥊
I just saw Patrick Stewart gripping Hey Arnold's head like a lumpy limp sausage. I don't know how to feel about that.
That's quite entertaining
knuckles pretending that scaling sheer surfaces isn't his ONE DEFINING TRAIT
I can’t believe knuckle was in there.
gives me that cartoon network universe vibes
Knuckles could easily have climbed up there with the rope, but instead he insists on throwing a child. That tracks
The skip button is used on 99.9% of ads as soon as it is available but this ad is worth the two minutes i spent amd the re-watch. Ive taken multiple surveys on how likely i am to share or talk about certain ads and most are like a 2-4/10. This a 10/10 if i didnt see the paramount official account i would think this was a parody its so good.
Hey, paramount+ marketing. You guys alright over there?
Couldn’t the Enterprise just beam them up?
They need to make this into a show.
So, uh... who had "Star Trek TNG x Hey Arnold x Sonic The Hedgehog x Halo x Peppa Pig Crossover" on their 2024 bingo card? Nobody? Me neither...
As someone who grew up watching Hey Arnold, I can tell you..... this is surprisingly way out of character for him.  He was surprisingly chill with the idea of being thrown. The real Arnold would've been much more freaked out and tried to talk everyone into finding another solution.
Cringe
Just something about hollywood actors and "child" dont seem right to me but im sure it went over yall heads and then Tua with his upside down crosses , how blind can yall be
Pour Arnold they could have used knuckles
Patrick Stewart comes off as very unlikeable.
Surprisingly really good love it lol *slat* I'm good lol
Probably the only ad i dont mind watching all the way threw
We throw the child......
Knuckles can climb walls!!!
Did you know it costs $7 million per 30 seconds of air time during the Super Bowl? So if you do the math it cost $35 million to air this ad in its entirety.
Everyone talking about all the other characters but my main man Officer Jim Dangle over there rocking them shorts in the cold….
Make a movie out of this.
Sir Patrick > Tik Tok Patrick
Knuckles is the most exiting paromount character there
This commercial will go down as being a classic! This was great lol. Good job Paramount!
Oh boy there’s going to be a lot of tantrums when one of the teams loses
1:17 they couldnt walk around the wall and climb to their right?
Not sure why he didn’t throw Peppa in the first place!
Is this real life? 😂
😂 That's was awesome. Can you take me higher, 😂 god bless paramount.
Thomas Lennon still looking great
Arnold is finally putting his football head to good use.  And LEAVE THE PIG ALONE!
This is the best commercial I have ever seen.
I have an idea for a Paramount Mountain thing, but if you do it and aren’t already planning to do it, I would like credit for it. The idea is a fight between the Death-Egg Robot (Sonic 2), and either Megatron or Scourge + Terrorcons.
Good to see someone at Paramount finally got into shrooms
The moment you realize Knuckles could've just CLIMBED up himself...
This was a fever dream from start to finish
I never thought I'd see Captain Picard interact with Arnold, but here we are.
Knuckles, who can freakin' CLIMB UP WALLS, just wants to watch the mayhem unfold, and I approve 🤣
I love it.
Everyone says “Hey Arnold”. No one ever asks “How’s Arnold”.
What?
Knuckles is here! Paramount knows da wae!
STOP THROWING CHILDREN-
He now knows how it feels to be Eugene.
Come on Paramount I want to See Sponge bob riding a dolphin..
Paramount ruined Star Trek until Terry Matalas did Picard Season 3.
Who does Arnold’s voice here? His first few lines sound like archives from the show but his last few lines definitely aren’t.
Drew berrymore needs every gig she can get after getting on her knees for that fake woman mulvany.
Throw teammate!
Is that GRAMMY AWARD WINNING band Creed?!
Not Peppa hahahahahaha
Best ad in years! I laughed so hard 🤣 If I didn't already have the service I'd sign up after that 😂
Man, Creed was the Rangers’ good luck charm last season, will this happen again this season?
1:39 Picard…you HAD one job!
I hope this means we’re getting a hey Arnold new season
This is a laugh out loud joke every 7 seconds! The "Creed" tat was unreal! Great job. Terrific job! Funny = Money
Why did it bring me to tears when Sir Patrick kissed Arnold’s head? 😂
I hope this plays during the Super Bowl!!! 😂😂😂
You know everyone is going to start telling Drew Barrymore… “Barrymore Shut Your Face!”
Poor Master Chief. They massacred my boy.
I love Sir Patrick Stewart OBE… I hope he lives forever.
Paramount sure is spending a lot of money for you to give them your money.
Wait, why wouldn't they just tie a rope to Knuckles and he can climb up while they hold onto the rope
Best Thing Ever
this was funny but come on, can't believe y'all added knockoff dora and not the original, that'd fit this commercial, she's got a football head too 😡
Great
Surreal surprising amount of nostalgia in this commercial. Fn awesome
SuperBowl 🏈 on cable channel is better and not streaming services !
Cartoons being mistreated and used by Movies,reality shows and Video game characters! It’s inhumane🌌📺💧🥺💔
we just gonna ignore the fact that they're gonna skin peppa pig after this?
Knuckles can climb!?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We all know tua ain't making that throw in that freezing temperature
My life is complete now
Because of this commercial, I will become a Paramount plus subscriber😂😂😂
This 2 minute commercial was better than any movie Disney’s come out with in a while! 😆
So good
I haven't seen a Super Bowl ad this good since Vader Kid started his dad's car.
I can't imagine the budget that had to go into getting all these names to do a commercial like this
I cant believe arnold has made a comeback and creed has too. To see peppa pig,atnold,creed,barrynore,halo, star trek in tge sane ad is wild.
I'm surprised they didn't ask Knuckles to climb up there with the rope and hoist it down
We used to be a proper country, then we weren't and now we are
These kind of things were cool for a little bit then you get older and realize exactly what you are looking at...  Edit: Patrick Stewart saying "shut your face" and being bald just makes me want to watch Karl Pilkington in well anything...   Second Edit: "and that's kicking your assth" - Drew Barrymore in Charlies Angels...  Third Edit: I know Arnold doesn't say it but you could have had him say "I'm okay" instead of "I'm good" just as a reference...
I love everything about this.
Knuckles!
This commercial is funny but kinda stiff. Eugene is happy he's not victimize this time.
im floored by how effective this commercial is
Dora’s lucky they changed her design 😂😂😂
Arnald, Peppa Pig, Knuckles and Master Chef all in the same is just some I never knew I needed to see. Also found it funny that Knuckles speciality is climbing and no one thought about that
This is an ad worth watching!!
who the girl in the pink at 0:19
what the little girl here &  tv show name? in the pink
Master Chief is like: Yo I literally have a built in grapple to my suit
Hey Arnold is one of the best cartoons hands down
Poor Arnold is never going to hear the end of this from Helga
Pin this i ❤ you guys 😅
Fundies are freaking out about this for some reason
Isn’t that child abuse?
Holy sh*t the animation of Patrick throwing Arnold 😂😂😂
Knuckles could’ve climbed the wall now peppa has to die 😭😭
Family. (If u know u know )
I like how Arnold was kind of all for it
😂😂😂 best commercial ever
I’m really looking forward to the Knuckles Spinoff Series! It’s gonna be WAY PAST COOL! 😎 👍
Is Arnold okay?
Cameos > Creativity
"BARRYMORE, SHUT YOUR FACE!!!"  Thank you, Sir Patrick Stewart, for saying what we were all thinking.
The fact that the industry that controls actors like Patrick is just sad. They really force a 80 year old man to do this sport commercial, a sport of which he doesn’t care.
I'm all set with buying 24533454 different streaming services, but this commercial is packed with so much of my childhood lol
Rip Peppa 😔
I just noticed Master Chief pointing at the grappling hook on his arm
Umm… Couldn’t Knuckles have just climbed up there?
Jim Dangle in his 'new' boots was inspired greatness.
They really did my boy Arnold like that! 😂
Broo 😂
OMG, that was hilarious. Just give them the award for best SB commercial.
We need Charlie Brown or Snoopy on these commercials tbh😂
This is the best
Peppa at the end 😅
Now this isn’t bad. Although Josh Allen would have threw it over the mountain
Master chief pointing at his grappling hook 🤦‍♂️🤣
So..... Does that mean there will be more seasons of Picard?!
This made me laugh. Even knuckles did so
I'll take this over Disney any day now. Let me know when y'all open parks in Texas. It's much needed!
I think I own the same type of coat Patrick Stewart's wearing
Just pure...unadulterated cringe.
This commercial broke me. I'm still wondering what I watched. XD
Can Knuckles just climb up the wall with his fists? 😅
It looks like in this moment Arnold kind of understands what it's like to be Eugene😂
Why couldn't Chief climb it with the rope, armor lock himself as anchor and that be the way everyone climbs up?
Once I heard Creed I was sold.
I was laughing so hard when i saw this
We been waiting to see this
"Its the 5th Quarter and we need a hole-in-one before the 7th inning stretch." Whoever wrote that for Sir Patrick Stewart to say is an absolute madlad and a f'ing genius.
Cool cameo
This is the best commercial ever. Period. I'm sorry. Take the L, everyone else.
Feels like a Charlie Brown reference😂
If only master cheeks would keep his helmet on in the show as much as he does in this.
I yelled increasingly louder every time I saw these amazing people in the best ad I’ve seen in years!
This is fantastic
Throwing Arnold lol 😆
Good to see a tribute to Hey Arnold
This is unironically the best commercial I have ever seen in my entire life.
"Now if there were only someone made of pigskin."  _Pointing to Peppa Pig_ "Bingo."  "Oh dear-"
Everyone at the Paramount marketing department deserves a huge raise after this.
OMG they’re sacrificing all of the Nickelodeon characters! 😱
Barrymore you shut your face!
Another day 30 years from now we will be like "Remember when Patrick Stewart threw Arnold like a football as Creed played Higher as Master Chief and knuckles stood by?"
❤❤❤❤ Mark Tremonti ❤❤❤
Fortnite in a couple years
Dangle and Knuckles being on the same page is hilarious to me for some reason.
Why is Jeff Probst there 💀
Every CREED meme has led to this moment
Don't lie, we're all here for Knuckles.
Helga’s never going to let him live this down.
Creed, Master Chief and Arnold!!! 😂 What a COMBO! 😂
Poor Peppa ... I can't wait to show this to my daughter.
I'm buying paramount premium, excel, plus, extra, just because of this amazing commercial
Ugh oh peppa
LOL at the use of the 6 Million Dollar Man sfx when Stewart releases Arnold
This is legendary
As a lifelong dolphins fan, it's nice to see we are finally being recognized.
Okay, um, I REALLY don't if anyone's said this but, Knuckles is there. KNUCKLES IS THERE. He can CLIMB it's in the name people!
Hearing Patrick Stewart menacingly say “we can throw the child” is something I didn’t know I needed
it would be hilarious if Knuckles reveals he could've climbed up there himself but just wanted to see him do it
Why didn't Chief even try?
Why are they in the middle of the TransAntarctic Mountains?
OH SNAP! The song from the Titan A.E movie trailer!
I would watch a series of this. Anyone else?
"Barrymore, shut your face!" 🤣🤣🤣
Whoever thought of this Ad, please do more, even other companies need to do this.
Does this tease a new Arnold series???? Or season or is Arnold just there
Does this tease a new Arnold series???? Or season or is Arnold just there
👍 well done
so no one is gonna credit Sir Pat for hitting the post, eh?
I am getting Paramount+ because of how perfect this ad is. Thank you for this gift
1:47 Well at least *SOMEONE'S* gonna give Peppa Pig her comeuppance   Thank you Patrick Stewart for that...  If Ian McKellen was there this would've been even better but whatever
If Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen was in this Paramount Mountain short, he will be against the idea of everybody use Peppa Pig as a football because Peppa Pig is Josh Allen's friend.
Knuckles the Echidna, Lt. Jim Dangle, and John-117 agree with Patrick Stewart
Scott Stapp did the “1000 Yesseahs” sound.
Sir Patrick is a legend.
Knuckles is the first character in the Sonic franchise to appeared one of these Paramount Mountain shorts without the cave drawing of Sonic in a previous one with Aang, Big Nate, Dora, Peppa Pig, Blue and two of the members of Paw Patrol exploring inside of a cave with cave paintings.
So happy to see that ol football head is still relevant today 😊
Creed! Why I'm more excited to see Creed then everyone else.
I almost passed out from laughing when the music kicked in
I came here for Creed and Deputy Dangle
perfect
CREED!!!!
This is the one of the most beautiful commercials I’ve ever seen. So many beloved characters I grew up with!!! <3
I’m glad Creed is finally getting the respect they deserve.
Someone needs to make a meme show like this
If you told me this was an acid flashback, I would believe you.
Oh god, this may be the greatest advertisement to ever exist 🤣🤣🤣
Drew Barrymore sounds so thrilled when she says "Creed's Here"😂😂😂
I love how Master Chief was just pointing at the grapple hook lol
This is the best commercial in decades.
Is that Ernest?
Hahaha  Move it Football head
Stewie Griffin was unavailable.
Very in character for Knuckles forgetting he can climb walls
Why not let knuckles climb the mountain
Now I know how Dave from 2001: Space Odyssey feels.
Thank you
My friend texted me this. This years Super Bowl ads looking good so far.
I love the fact that Arnold is in this. It crazy that there's a commercial that features Arnold alongside Knuckles and Master Chief.
Poor Arnold. Let’s hope Peppa can do better than him.
Not to mention Arnold wasn’t even thrown properly… shouldn’t he be flying sideways.
Should have had Kirk Cousins in this.
Arnold as a football 😂
The fact patrick Stewart is already dressed as a football player tells me he's been waiting for the day he he can toss Arnold like a football.
I want this to be a full length movie lol
This commercial is a Masterpiece
1:51 It was at this moment Peppa knew she's gonna be 🥓
This is just epic
I felt bad for Arnold but was rooting for them to yeet Peppa Pig at the cliff lol
Knuckles you can freaking climb walls!!
this add did a better master chief than the whole Show,
Paramount plus ads are literal fever dreams I swear
STATUE OF LIBERTY DOUBLE REVERSE FLEA FLICKER RAZZLE DAZZLE FUMBLERUSKI… ❌👏🏻⭕️
I thought peppa pig was taller than that.
I remember when SuperBowl commercials didn't come out until the SuperBowl.
Too bad Uncle Rico wasn't there.
Tua Turntheballover, Creed, Sir Patrick Stewart, Knuckles, Master Chief, JEFF PROBST. This crossover is crazy
Knuckles can literally climb these things. It's what he does.
Honestly, Companies need to make more commercials like these 😂 The plot hole of Master Chief's Grappling hook only made it that much funnier
All of the line deliveries are fantastic.   "Barrymore shut your face!"  "And creeds here" this delivery cracks me up every time.   So good!
How can this terrible streaming service score so much in ads. ?
That isht was hilarious 😂
Deleting my paramount account for this nonsense. You guys are so out of touch, it’s disgusting.
Knuckles standing by while they decide who to throw… knowing his abilities and still opting for someone throw Arnold is 100 percent his personality
The Dolphins now HAVE to draw up a new play and call it Throw The Child. And next year they should throw Peppa😂
XD
Haven't released an album in 15 years, still playing that one out of the 3 songs you're known for and somehow still relevant enough to be put in this commercial with current hot topics. Nice to see ya leeching like true professionals, good for you Creed.
That was really enjoyable and funny. Thank you for having a sense of humor.  10/10.
Demonic.
This was so dumb and I still loved it ❤️
Wait. Knuckles can climb I'm sure... Plot hole.
Now if Tom Brady and Ted were there...
"Barrymore, shut your face!" 😆
Knuckles thinks using Arnold, a football-shaped kid as a literal football would be a good and smart idea. Knuckles probably also thinks using Peppa Pig as a football, in case Arnold failed, which he did is also a good and smart idea.
@ 1:52 Peppa's next.
Yo. Please tell me Keegan Key wrote this.
I spot something new every time I watch it! How about the Six Million Dollar Man sound effect 🦾when Sir Patrick throws Arnold 🏈
This is not the multiverse we want but the one we deserve
I'm not paying for another streaming service
It's so nice to see Sir Patrick Stewart doing a live action Avery Bullock.
I love this Superbowl commercial
Please stop hurting John 113
I'll pay for paramount but only to support their commercials.  And master chief.
Sir Patrick Stewart better watch his back. A little girl with one is gonna hunt him down for that
Should have had Uncle Rico throw him
Now I liked to see something like this but with Sony Pictures characters like Spider man, Venom, The Smurfs and other characters
Oh Heck No!
This is both the worst and the best commercial ive ever seen
dam we got a super soldier with a literal hook shot, and a rodent that can literally clime walls. like, that is his whole thing.
Best live action Robot Chicken sketch ever!
Fortnite getting jealous with these collabs
This series is why i was born! Please continue it! Ill pay with what little money i have!
Definitely the best commercial ever made!
This better mean new episodes of Hey Arnold!
Weirdest fever dream.
If chief was there.. why didnt he throw anything? However the humor was gold. Play call of " Throw the child" on Sir Stewarts wrist was gold!
Knuckles watching everyone fail when he could just climb to the top.
And Creed is here......😅
NICE
Never thought I would see Patrick Stewart throw Arnold like an actual football    WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE!!!!
This may be the greatest thing my eyes have ever witnessed in 37 years..
Drugs did this.
Knuckles can climb walls but I still liked this
Peppa Pig is toast
Poor Peppa...why they keep picking on her,lol  Honestly I keep coming back to this and really and truly it's iconic and nostalgic....whoever the team who dreamed this one up deserves a raise
A Hail Arnold haha that’s funny! 🤣
I rewatched all of Hey Arnold 10 years ago on Netflix, if only Paramount actually had anything I wanted to watch.
This is an amalgamation of things I love combined with things I hate(YEAH I'M STARING AT YOU CREED!). It has no right to be as funny as it is and make me love it.
Yall need to immediately promote whoever’s idea this commercial was
Master chief could throw that child i to orbit. Let chief throw the kid they wouldn’t freeze then.
😂😂
This is a masterpiece. All other film and literature pales in comparison. This must be preserved for posterity at all costs. When all of human society is wiped from the face of the earth, may this commercial be what we are remembered for by whatever comes next.
Greatest superbowl commercial ever!
Now that I think about it, I'm hoping Peppa as to carry that hook if she were to be thrown, then throw it at a certain altitude higher than herself so that the hook actually could reach the top. If only they thought of that when throwing Arnold. I hope they consider that if they were to throw him a second time. (Sorry, Arnold. Please no hard feelings.)
Knuckles can climb walls............
Knuckles suggesting throwing a child is smart thinking is so in character 😂
"Shut your face, Barrymore."  Underrated line of the year there.
This is good
why is paramount out shitposting me?
That was a pretty good commercial. No agenda, no propaganda, just entertainment. It's a shame more of these no longer exist.
Why didn't Knuckles just scale the wall?
Now if there were only someone made of pig skin. Peppa: OH DEAR
Cant Knuckles climb walls?
Or you can Try Dora… She also has a football head
This commercial is better than ppl realize!
Reminds me of when Cartoon Network used to make ads like this. Cartoon Network was the Fortnite of cartoons at their prime
At least Master Cheeks has his helmet on in the ad, but not in the show
F*** Paramount, but that was a hilarious.
"Oh Dear" 😧 Peppa Says
Bro I want this to be a actual series like total drama island fr
josh allen could have done it
*Meanwhile* Helga: *Gasps* It happened… I felt it. He was used as a football.
Dangle having the Creed lower back tattoo definitely checks out
Lol I love how Chief is just like "Uh, bro..grappleshot?"
Best day ever. Thanks everyone. Especially you, Patrick Stewart. 😊
I was thinking Stewie Griffin
Perfect commercial lol
Was waiting for Master Chief to take his helmet off for no reason.
This is terrible.
That was too funny!
This is so funny
This is hands down the best Corporate use of a current meme I have ever witnessed.
Is that knuckles? 1:33
Love how Chief spends the ENTIRE VIDEO standing there, doing absolutely NOTHING, doesn’t even make a sound. And of course, Knuckles is all for the throwing of the football head xD
Arnold is a “football headed kid” after all.
Not ready for the moment 😂😂😂
This is supposed to be funny?  A suggestion to "Throw the Child?"
This was a roller-coaster ride of emotions.
Master chief looked at Arnold like "Why is there a child flying, what in the world"💀.   I heard of hey arnold for a while but Arnold was done dirty finally😂
I thought Creed was gone. I thought Scott Stapp was dead after what 4chan did to him.
Come onnn
Patrick Stewart > Tua
I knew upon release of that lousy throw  lacking any spiral it was never gonna make it
This advert is solid gold!
ARE THEY GONNA MAKE MORE HEY ARNOLD
Omg poor Arnold lol 😂 Also so cool Creed was in this video
Jeff Probst doesnt have a clue but hes just there for the chaos.
“Oh dear”😭🤣
Tua would have probably thrown the ball the wrong way anyway 🤣
Is hey Arnold revival going to happen???
"I just threw him higher.... to a place where we won't freeze."
I bet this was Patrick's idea
Plot twist: Arnold is a kid wearing a green cgi suit that Patrick actually threw
Never thought I’d see Patrick Stewart throwing Arnold while creed plays but I’m happy about it
I love these commercials so much. 😂
LOVE IT!  lol
Also love that arnold has a tiny football helmet on his head
Sooooo...we just gonna ignore the fact that KNUCKLES is here?
This might be the greatest commercial in the history of existence.
How does Paramount  forget they have the ninja turtles. I mean, they have a blimp, right?
The best commercial I've seen in a while. The wristband play call was the best part for me. I can't stop watching this 😂😂😂😂
If every add was like this there would be no skip button
Stewie Griffin would've made a better football...🏈
“What is this a crossover episode?”
Is Creed just there for the ha ha or is Paramount their record label or something?
Creed
Oh Dear 1:51
🎶 "I just threw him higher... to a place we won't freeze" 🎶 😂😂😂  (Now every time I hear the song by creed, till will be at the forefront of my brain telling me these the lyrics for the song without question) 🤣
LOL
Dude… just play the commercial during the actual Super Bowl. No more surprises anymore?
This one had me CACKLING also...hearing Patrick Stewart say to Drew "Barrymore, shut your face!" Cracked me up! 🤣🤣🤣
"We throw the child" 😂😂😂 - Sir Patrick Stewart 😂
Why did they do this to my boy creed
dang bro
I wonder what would happen if they made Knuckles throw Arnold. I need to see that.
Am I going mental, or was that Jim Varney?
This promo deserves an Oscar, Emmy, Golden Globe, SAG Award, Critics Choice, Addy, PROMAX, and a whole boatload of everything else.  As a former TV station marketing director, this is genius and truly the Mt. Rushmore of advertising.
Annndddd creed's here! 😂 🤣
Poor Arnold but peppa is next
This cringey commercial actually convinces me to never consider subscribing to Paramount+
Better at 2x
Technically, Sir Patrick Stewart is probably from an age of football before the forward pass was a thing, so from a historical standpoint, this is illogical.  Everything else here, obviously, checks out.
So that was to among the worst things I've seen. Keep trying paramount, maybe someday you'll figure out this entertainment industry thing out
Paramount really fighting for relevancy...
I feel like this commercial is going to introduce most teenagers to Creed, and I like that.
Maybe if he didn’t throw Arnold off his back foot he would’ve gotten him there
Poor Peppa 😂
This commercial is atrocious...and yet...I love it.
Now is a great time to remind everyone that Hey Arnold is an amazing show and it’s a great FanFiction about the childhood of Batman…
The best Super Bowl commercial of all time. Case closed.
I’m surprised Sir Patrick Stewart is still alive
Honestly might be one of the best Super Bowl commercials of all time lol.
This is an absolute fever dream
0:19 "we throw the child"
The fact creeds back makes me happy
Is that the original va for Arnold?
I wonder if Patrick Stewart was able to keep a straight face the whole time? Especially when he said "We throw the child"
Wait. Couldn't Knuckles just climb the wall?
Can’t Knuckles just climb up there?
This is basically like those memes where it has bad news and has characters from different media reacting
Omg that had me dying inside lol
So... Funny 😅
Hole in one!😅😅😅
5th quarter! 😅😅😅
The Chief can make it up there easily.
Yay knuckles :D
Arnold just accepting his fate as cp kisses him on the  😅
This is how advertisements should work. I already have Paramount Plus but I wish I could subscribe again. Fantastic work!
Paramount+ fans point out funny parts of the commercial to them.  Tua haters focused on a single statement but missed the whole point. It's a commercial and I'm glad Tua is having fun with it, and getting paid doing it.
OMG , Creed Cruise 2024!!!!! Can't wait!!!! Love you Sir Patrick ❤️
Okay...This is literally the best Super Bowl ad ever!!!! I've already watched this like 5x and still keep laughing. Thank you Paramount for making my day!! 😊
Knuckles can climb and Master Chief can get up there with is Grappleshot and all of them didn't noticed about those two, lol
This is the greatest thing ever!!!!
They nailed the music, Creed has been making a crazy comeback on TikTok
Master chief, Knuckles, Peppa Pig, Arnold, Sir Patrick Stewart and Tua in a commercial with Creed doing the music is perfection
Best commercial I've seen in years!!!
So Tua needed something football-shaped to throw better, right? But then he refused to throw Arnold. So why didn't Patrick Stewart just throw the grappling hook?
IMO the best part is the play on Stewart's armband that just says "Throw the Child"
Fever dreams be like:
Knuckles could climb walls in Adventure 1 😂😂😂
Jesus Christ... This is like... Awesome.
He's still just doin' a lil boot goofin'.
Knuckles is such a bad influence to the others by letting Patrick Stewart throwing Arnold so funny
Tua and Lt. Jim Daingle. Thank you for this
cringe
Nuuuuuu! Not Peppa pig! 😆🙈
That is not Jean Luc Picard.  That is Avery Bullock.
it may be an ad but that doesn’t mean i don’t enjoy em (she loves the weirdest of crossovers)
Stewie better be glad he's not there😂😂
Paramount Plus is trash, and the people who own it are even trashing  But the people who conceived of and made this commercial did a fantastic job  (Edit to fix a typo)
Whoever wrote this ad understood the assignment nothing but peak comedy. From Master Chief silently signaling he has a grappling hook and being ignored, from the cuff saying THROW THE CHILD,  to Creed randomly showing up to sing all the way to Peppa Pigs “ Oh dear”.  The millennial that wrote this deserves a raise just absolute hilarity 😂
"Barrymore shut your face" 😂😂 im dead
The creed guy saying “ComeOWN!” Kills me every time
Can you put in Ren & Stimpy next?
Awesome 🎉
Epic 😂
Again
1:38 when Arnold gets hit at the mountain   Eugene: THATS FOR 27 YEARS
This is delightfully ridiculous
Everyones just going to ignore that knuckles can climb 90 degree walls with ease…
Omg knuckles in the Super Bowl
Cheaper to use rabbit ears for the Super Bowl.
One of the best commercials I've ever seen
Awesome
They should've got Uncle Rico to do it.
This is one of the beautiful things I’ve seen in my life.
I just watched the best commercial ever.  Why are Paramount+ commercials astronomically better than their actual streaming service?
Why didn’t you let Knuckles climb to the top with the rope?
This will probably be the best commercial aired during the Superbowl.
This is the masterpiece we never knew we needed.   I love this!
That has got to be the dumbest thing I’ve ever seen in my life. Unreal.
Reno 911!
It’s hilarious
For once, Arnold’s football shaped head is actually acknowledged lamo 😭
My man said what we've all wanted to do when we see a child with anything close to a football shaped head.
This is actual art
Brilliant.  Plus, I feel like Chief daily.
This Paramount+ Super Bowl Spot is hilarious 😂
It's hilarious that they all ignore the fact that master chief has a grappling hook and knuckles can climb walls. Also, knuckles is hanging out with master chief and pepper pig.
Maybe Barrymore should hire some Scabs to help her
This is just a Newgrounds cartoon from 20 years ago with a budget.
These are the kinds of ads we need right now.
Now if only they could throw Peppa Pig (or a certain blue family of dogs).  But yeah, I don't think anyone knew what Arnold's character was supposed to be. Hey Arnold was just not one of those shows (the same way FOP, Jimmy Neutron, Invader Zim, Ren & Stimpy, Angry Beavers, and Spongebob are).
This was fantastic!
If it were a Hulu ad, it'd be Stewie Griffin getting thrown
I just like we’re seeing Arnold in such high quality
I’m sorry but Josh Allen and Peppa Pig is better
MOVE IT FOOTBALL HEAD! 🏈
Man you know we’re getting old when they start targeting us in their ads. Jeez. We’re the next old folks next in line. Kinda weird. 😢
Tone-deaf.
Yeah this one wins
I feel like this not only cured my depression, but potentially every political, theological, human rights and socioeconomic crisis the world’s currently experiencing.
This is now my favorite commercial
Viacom Smash Bros
Let the girls wear bikinis again!!
Feels like  the 90s again 👍
Hehehehehehhe
I can't remember the last time I rewatched an ad so much.
This is the greatest ad in the history of the universe
This commercial won the superbowl
It's the 5th quarter and we need a hole-in-one before the 7th inning stretch!
The best kind of commercials are when they mix every show from a network together. NBC used to excel at this
Haram
Seeing Knuckles, Master Chief, and Peppa Pig in the same commercial officially is so surreal.
Maybe my tastes are different, but I think this is probably the stupidest most unfunny commercial I've ever seen.
Beam them up the to the top, Scotty!
This is how you commercial. I might get a month just for this. Thanks for making my YouTube ad not boring paramount.
1:19 The two time AFC Champion the Kansas City Master Chief.... Who didn't try to throw Arnold despite having the ability of Patrick Mahomes with him. Even then he shows more personality in this ad with his helmet on than on that mid show
Creed comeback
"And Creed's here..." Slays me.
The most genius ad ever. Patrick Stewart shows his acting brilliance in this comedic part. I have always loved Creed they are not Nickleback and they made music that made me believe in myself
Yeah we know Tua isn't built for the moment
Why are these actually funny bro, I swear this needs to be like an actual series
This isn't real.
This is the funniest commercial I’ve seen in years!
Finally when Arnold is actually used for something USEFUL 🙏
Paramount has the best advertising campaign in all of human history.
We used to sing that Creed song in football practice. We changed the lyrics to “to place where lineman see.”
The chief then proceeds to use his grappling hook
Paramount making the cross over we didn't know we wanted
GREATEST COMMERCIAL OF ALL TIME
If Master Chief is in the same crossover as Arnold, this confirms Master Chief to be in Nickelodeon All Star Brawl 2
The CGI Dora reboot hasn’t even come out yet and they’re already putting her in the commercials
I have never in my life seen a better commercial and I don’t think I ever will.. 😂👏🏼 way to go paramount
God bless you Sir Patrick Stewart!😎😇👍🏈👌
Why didn’t knuckles just climb the wall
This wouldn't have happened if they threw Gerald instead. He has a more aerodynamic shape.
😵  misted by that much 😵‍💫
Can’t believe we live in a world where Patrick Stewart throws hey Arnold as master chef watches amazing
The problem here is they've got Tua instead of JA17.
WHOMEVER, at Paramount came up with this idea. No matter how big or small, thank you from the bottom of my heart. The sudden loss of my mother and struggling with unexpected weight gain from depression, has left my soul empty most nights. BUT THIS, oh but this gave me tears of Laughter and Joy, my teenage TV idol...Captain Picard and my teen Band idol...Creed...with a supporting cast of characters I have come to adore as well, shined a light in places not even the highest paid therapy has been able to do. "Peace and Long Life".
Sir Patrick Stewart telling Drew Barrymore to shut her face is the emotional catharsis that I didn’t know I needed until now.
This was hilarious Super Bowl commercials are back
Where's the Evil cast?
wait what?
Knuckles can climb and run up the wall 💀
Please, never die, Pat.
Kudos to paramount+ for making some of the best adverts as of late
This is the first time I searched for a commercial I saw on YouTube just to see the commercial again.  This was hilarious.
Wow..that’s hilarious luv it!!😂😂🐬👏
Even this commercial got masterchief right better than the tv show.
2001 creed superbowl implemented into a football themed movie stream services with multiple childhood figures of the 90s era and early 2000s movie and cartoon characters all in one commercial add. Nuff said
Pepa pig is supposed to be 7 foot tall this isn't accurate to the lore.
Comedy gold
Loved it❤💯305🌴
This feels like a cross over fanfiction turned into a SB commercial
Hey Arnold!          MOVE IT, FOOTBALL HEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sr Patrick is so funny and iconic
THIS IS THE BEST COMMERCIAL IN ALL OF EXISTENCE!!!
This is how IP needs to be used. Beautiful
The thumbnail is all I needed to see to know this was going to be my favorite commercial I’ve ever watched. The football shaped head finally was useful
This is what happens when Millennials are free to make commercials.
Hey Arnold is my favorite cartoon growing up. This is the best commercial ever
I’m waiting for an ad with my team the Jets
I’d pay good money to hear Sir Patrick Stewart commentating for the actual Super Bowl, or any sport for that matter. His level of sports knowledge seems to be Higher than that of anyone else on the planet. I bet even high enough that blind men could see. He sees the plays no one else is brave enough to see
It’s so great millennials are writing commercials now. This is genius
The fact that knuckles could climb up there but doesn't, makes it that much better 😂
I love how nobody points out the fact that knuckles could’ve just climbed up there
Omg 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’m done😂
"Throw the child" -Patrick Stewart 2024     we need a paramount mountain movie made right now
They used AI to give Sir Patrick his younger voice
Is this an ad for the Super Bowl?
It felt like a fever dream
If only we had someone made of pig skin   Bingo   Peppa: oh dear! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oh dear
I mean... could've knuckles have made that thrown without a football lol.
Surprised arnold is a part of the commercial
Here for Tua 🐬⬆️
What is Knuckles doing there?
All because Arnold’s head is football 🏈 is Football Head like Helga said
And Creed here! 😂😂 amazing!!
I’m surprised no one brought up the fact that Knuckles is a climber who could easily scale the wall in seconds.
Arnold finally used his head!
Wish there were more commercials like this, it is dorky but fun
First time I’ve ever clicked a sponsored video and I am not disappointed
Brilliant 🔥
Didn't realize Sir Patrick was a lefty lol🤔
This is the most millennial thing I’ve ever seen
Now I need to see Stewie get thrown 💀
Peppa! Why have you left Josh? Now who's going to laugh with him when he hits Beevus in the groin with a pass from his cannon of an arm?!
I would definitely watch this if it was a movie 🍿🎥
I live near Fort Lauderdale.  Water Spouts look worse than they are, barely a tornado....  the water vapor makes them look way bigger
The longest time master cheeks (John halo) wore his helmet.
Bro Paramount unintentionally roasting Tua.  "Not built for the moment" and they're in a cold environment lol
Sir Patrick should be in madden
This is the greatest commercial ive ever seen.  And I've seen some good ones.  It hits every spot and several I didn't know I had
Having Master Chief there reminds me of intense Halo seshes with the boys with rock music such as Creed, Benjamin and etc. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
LOL! 😂
Could knuckles  being there  be a sign of a teaser for  the  knuckles miniseries?
Wait a minute, Knuckles came climb, dig and scale mountains with his fist.
I know it’s part of paramount but how does Craig Bartlett let this happen to Arnold ?
Where’s Helga?…….
When future people ask when we peaked as a society, we're going to show them this.
Love this!  For me, it's up there with the Doritos Goat Commercial, which is one of my favorites! 😆
I need this to be a movie.
lol my dad sent me this video he’s silly
If only we had a guy with knuckles who could climb things well
This might be the greatest commercial ever made
Hey Arnold, Thomas Lennon and Creed. Best AD ever.
y’all set tua up 😭
“Not built for the moment”  Sums up Tua lol.
This is incredible
Barrymore is the new Wesley.
It should’ve been Dora!
WHY DIDDNT THEY USE KNUCKLES HEE CAN CLIMB OMFMFHDNG
They did Arnold dirty. 😂
This may have already won best commercial for the Super Bowl.
“Not built for the moment I see.” Coming from Picard addressed to Tua just hurts me deep as a a Dolphins fan. Love the AD tho. So funny
This is the greatest..”shut your face” wow
This has to be one of the stupidest “ads” I’ve ever seen in my life…God I hope the actors that were involved with this were payed well.
This is the funniest commercial I’ve seen in a long time. I love it
Seeing Master Chief express emotions with his body language is a lot better than taking off his helmet.
We want one more Hey Arnold movie!
Seriously tua took an L for this commercial. When Patrick said he wasnt built for the moment.😅
This is it. The best Super Bowl commercial I’ve ever seen.
I hope he either volunteered or was paid way too much money
Master Chief kept his helmet on longer in this scene than any scene in the Halo TV Show.
As John Mulaney said about Patrick Stewart: “Rich people are weird as sh*t”
Can’t express how badly I want the rest of Arnold’s verse
This is how it's done people! This is a Superbowl commercial! "Great, Creeds here."😂😂😂❤
I hope Stewart, beloved by my family, owes Arnold and Peppa an apology.
This is better than any Super Bowl commercial I’ve seen. And it’s not even a Super Bowl commercial 😅
“It’s the 5th quarter, and we need a hole in one before the 7th inning stretch” is an amazing line 😂
Anyone who has played a Sonic and Knuckles for Sega Genesis knows Knuckles can climb walls.
I don't think I've ever been more entertained by a commercial.
Quite possibly the funniest Super Bowl Commercial ever. And Sir Patrick says what we are all thinking: "BARRYMORE, SHUT YOU FACE!"
Barrymore SHUT YOUR FACE
Throw him throw him throw him throw him 🤣🤣
The REAL gutsy move was wearing those short shorts in freezing cold weather. (And I thought that Sir Patrick was a Man United fan.)
"And Creed's here..."
The 90s kid who wrote this deserves some brass. Amazing.
So they are about to skin Pepe 😭😭😭
I’m calling a penalty, too many mixed sports metaphors, 15 yards and loss of down!
Seeing Hey Arnold and Creed gave me so much nostalgia...💛 A few of my favorite things in one ☺️ My childhood...🥰 and it's hilarious 🤣
Subspace Emissary
Seeing this randomly is weird.
This is amazing 😂
"...we throw the child"
Pepper better run
Imagine Swiper the Fox meets Tails the two-tailed fox on the paramount commercial short!
Child abuse
So funny!
WOW! best commercial ever! Get rid of the wokeness cancer and back to this America!
Can this be a show please?
I had the presence of mind to know creed was lame when that song came out.... but ngl, it's kinda a ripper
I like to think all these characters are stuck in some kind of purgatory, forced to climb this never-ending mountain for as long as Paramount has ownership of them.
Knuckles can climb walls.
Gonna need a prequel trilogy for how these events unfolded to start with...go ahead, I'll wait.
Well, Football Head finally moved it.
This is everything I could want and more.
LISTEN CLOSELY IT’S “BELT”
Bring back a new Hey Arnold! series!
That is f**king' funny!
I miss Hey Arnold
in awe how hard this went…
Aight Paramount you did good on this one!  Friggin CREED!!!!!!
Throw The Child.
Master Chief can throw that child
There will never be a better commercial than this. Arnold may not have made it to the peak, but this ad did.
I feel like my life will never be as good as it was in the last 2 minutes.
I am insane now
We have officially peaked as a society. This is the pinnacle.
CAN YOU TAKE ME HIGHER TO A PLACE CALLED HASBRO!!! I Love this Song!!!! Thank you Paramount, God Bless.❤😢🫡✊
KNUCKLEEESSSS
did....i just watch captain Picard throw arnold up a cliff to a creed song? while Nkuckles and master chief watch?
You gotta love it. LETS GO TUA & FINS UP
I've watched this 17 times and counting and there's something new everytime i see it, its so great 😃
Best comercial ever
Yes, Patrick. Throw me as if I was an artillery shell back in the Battle of Britain
Using a child as a football is definitely what Deputy Direct Bullock would do lol 😂🤣 and saying "shut your face" to the most rational person around as well. 😂
Knuckles in here by himself with all these big names, MAKE OUR BOY A STAR SEGA!! I hope his show does well, maybe he can finally get his own proper game.
Dangle's Creed trampstamp is literally EVERYTHING!
shut ur face!
What a great commercial
Peppa is actually over six feet tall.
😂😂 that was grate. Hey arnold was a grate cartoon.
Tua can't make that throw in the cold weather.
It's the 5th quarter, and we need a hole-in-one before the 7th inning stretch, lol GENIUS!
This commercial is hilarious.  Creed yessssss❤❤❤❤. Welcome back Creed
This may be the best advertisement i've ever seen. Creed was the cherry on top for me.
I REALLY hope the goons (mostly soup) sees this lol
Creed did it for me 🤣
Poor Peppa she's dead 1:51
This ad to be honest feels like a trailer to a movie and it would be called paramount  Also poor peppa
Paramount just passed Bud light in commercials. Catching up to Doritos
Best thing i have seen paramount do in a min. That just brings me back to the good old days when tv was great.
"Dang he's cool." LOL!!!
They disrespected the most innocent Cartoon Character ever! Might as well make him wear pink bunny onesies >~< ..
Hands down the greatest commercial ever made
What a creepy commercial. I got the chills from being creeped out
What were they planning to do with Peppa?
Genius! This is an awesome way to start the day! Love everything about it!
this is insane. KNUCKLES‼️
I’m CRYYYYYINGGGGG 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This team understood the fkn assignment.
This was the first thing I woke up to on Twitter this morning. Idk what kind of timeline I'm living in, but you know what? I fully accept it. 😂
I just love how Sir Patrick Stewart tells Barrymore;  SHUT UP!
This. This is amazing
One of the greatest commercials in a long time
arnold must got some insane whiplash lol
I just love how when the music starts Barrymore is like “and creeds here” with a go figure look on her face 😂 this is one of the most nostalgic commercials I’ve seen in a while.
"So anyway, that's why i was late. Whats new with your arbiter?" - Masterchief
Absolutely love this, great commercial ❤🔥😂
Absolutely amazing!!😂😂😂🤙🏻
Bout time someone told Drew Barrymore to shut up.
This has me so weak 😂😂😂
Three weeks until these are all skins available on fortnite.
These commercials are genius love the collab of characters
Yo but they got pepper all wrong tho she 6'9 ain't she or am I wrong lol
P+ Marketing way to go!
Why tua they should’ve done josh again
Please air this commercial during the Super Bowl!!!! lol 😂
Why throw Arnold when knuckles is standing right there 🤓 he runs up walls
Today I learned Stewart is a lefty
If Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, and Zuko were there they would just bend the mountain down...
This is the single greatest thing I have ever seen.
Poor Arnold n Peppa lol
I just like how of all people, Jim Dangle is there.
This should’ve been an actual movie
Best thing I have ever seen 😂
it was funny although I like Peppa pig and Hey Arnold
I can't even describe to you how happy I am to see creed coming back again. It's like I never left middle school. Learned every single one of their songs on guitar haha
This is stuck in my head now
And knuckles could've climbed it easily too 😂
I am in awe to see what feels like an early Youtube Poop live on television
This made me belly laugh in manner I wasn't expecting.
Peppa pig is dead
Patrick Stewart is Unhunged in this ad 😂
This was great
“ We throw the Child.” 2024
On god these are my dreams
This was one of the funniest commercials I’ve ever seen 😂 Still ain’t buying paramount plus though
Can’t knuckles climb walls?
😂😂😂😂 Peppa Pig at the end
ayo nobody else finna say this commercial wierd asf??
Patrick Stewart: I just threw him *H I G H E R ! ! !* Creed: *H I G H E R ! ! !*
If ads were in the Olympics, they’d have the gold!
I love commercials sometimes. This was great
My God it's Arnold. I miss the neighborhood and everyone 😢
Knuckles the Echidna is literally able to climb walls. He's the perfect character to help them in this situation. just saying
This is- AMAZING??
😂😂😂😂
This is the best thing I have watched in a long time...lol
Conspiracist lunatics will say “the ice wall, they’re putting in our faces”
You mean Patrick Stewart not sir
It kills me when Drew Barrymore is just like "and Creed's here." 🤣😂😆
I literally cannot even this is the most incredible thing I've seen in so very long 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this was pure artistry 🙌
This commercial genuinely made me laugh. I can’t remember the last time one of those did that.
Um Well The MASTER CHIEF Has a Grappling Hook 😂
Arnold dead
Cpt. Picard throwing Arnold like a football was hilarious enough. Getting CREED of all bands involved made it even better! XD
I love this! 😂
What... da fuq.... did I just watch? 🤣
Aaannd Creed's here ... 😂
Why is creed here? What show are they in? I'm dying. Please helps
Few secs later Peppa gets yeeted
Feel like the marketing department was like how do we target millennials with this one ad. They were like oh yeah, Captain Picard/ Professor X, hey Arnold, creed, survivor, halo, Dora and sonic we will definitely get them
0/10 Didn't show Peppa getting thrown
I love how he doesn't even throw him like a football. The wind resistance is what failed him.
i actually loved this 😂 especially the ending, "now if only someone were made of pigskin..." *peppa sweats nervously*
I’ll like the video so they know that these are the type of ads people wany
Coulda been better if they put in the one last breathe "I'm 6 feet from the edge" when he almost made it😭
Who ever wrote this. In the creative board of directors room pitching ideas, Cheers mate 🫶💪
It’s the fifth quarter and we need a hole in one.. the people chanting “THROW THE CHILD”
Whoever came up with this should get a raise!! lol!!!
Creed and Tua! Awesome commercial
CREED MENTIONED 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No one’s saying anything about the little football helmet worthlessly sitting *on top* of Arnold’s head? 😂
CREED IS BACK BABY!
"Not built for the moment" holy christ someone call the hospital cause tua got BURNED
Why couldn't knuckles just throw Arnold up th .... Oh wait arnold would've ended up in the stratosphere or the atmosphere if knuckles threw him instead of the other guy who slightly resembles Prof.X, nevermind than.
"It's the 5th quarter, and we need a hole in one before the 7th inning stretch. "🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tua was great in this too!!
Brings new meaning to the term "football head". 😂😂😂  Also, i love these crossovers Paramount+ is doing! Keep up the good work 😊
This is a Ryan Reynolds quality commercial
Greatest. Ad. Ever
How high was the person who came up with this commercial?
@thegoonspodcast
I love this so much 😂
That was great haha. I wonder who did Arnold's voice here?
What kind of drug induced fever dream did I just watch?
So great to see Arnold returning, Maaster Chief from Halo, and Knuckles appearing on a Paramount commercial for the first time, can't wait to see more of these!
This commercial is excellent.
I would love to watch a show with this cast. Usually I hate commercials with football players in them but Tua did great.
Yes! Pi-pi likes this! You drink the pi and you like the pi yes Maybe splash a little pi-pi on Patrick Stewart Okay Patrick now you act like you like the pi-pi yesss Very good!!!
Let me be the first to say…this commercial is random and dumb af ✌️ oh and Paramount Plus is trash ❤️
I just love how Chief just points at his grapple shot but didn’t say anything. 😂
This is a goat commercial 🐐
I wish Netflix would do something like this. Maybe with characters from Stranger Things and Wednesday and Dragon Prince. Maybe Voltron or She-Ra and Riders of Berk
How did  Creed make this all better
That is EPIC.
I laughed harder then I should have
This is like an AI created commercial. And its glorious
Doesn't beat the Beavis and Butthead one
They should made Paramount mountain in a tv series. It’s huge crossover series.
Im glad Tua was in it but I hope he does well in 2024
Insanely funny!  And is it hinting that halo is back for another season?!
Yo you can't do my boy arnold like that😅 better way to relive the 90s thank you
Too bad they cast woke drew Barrymore..she sucks hard. Otherwise its great!!!
And all this time I’m thinking “Where’s the Paw Patrol”
I wanna see jimmy nuetron next
Yeah, no one is topping that next Sunday.
Aren't they actually going to get colder the higher the climb up the mountain?
Ive had acid trips that made more sense than this. I love it
Me after seeing the commercial: ......Knuckles is right there. Have the anthropomorphic echidna climb the mountain. It's literally one of five things he's well-known for doing.🫤
I watched this on "The Independent", and Sir Patrick Stewart telling Arnold "Be brave" was closed captioned as "good grave". That made it more ominous than they probably intended.
Let’s be honest even if tua had a football he couldn’t make that throw
Wow, finally a good commercial!
It's like a dream on cold medicine.   I love it.
This is one of the funniest best written things I’ve seen in forever Saw it as an add and had to find and save it
I’m still tryna figure out who that is standing in between Dora and Knuckles
Man Sir  Patrick Strewart is a treasure
I really wish you would just wait for the super bowl. More than likely would have won the commercial battle. Amazingly funny, but sadly is disqualified
I feel extremely targeted marketing wise lol
I love everything about this. I lost it when creed started lol
Patrick Stewart really needs to do more comedy
I wish I was there in the pitch for this commercial. This is possibly the best ad since Berries and cream.
Sir patrick Stewart is really channeling director bullock in this one
Tua would have missed the throw anyway
Master Chief, mind telling me what you're doing in this commercial?  "Sir, absolutely nothing."
Getting a little long in the tooth there.
Is that Peppa Pig!?!?!?
I feel like this shouldn't exist
The subtle digs at Tua's perceived lack of arm strength.
YEET THE CHILD
Wait a minute, Knuckles can climb walls!
Uhh… Hello what about Knuckles. He can climb to the mountain: Master Chief: What about we could ask someone to climb to The Mountain. (Everyone turn around and see who?) Master Chief: I’m talking about him! Knuckles: Hmm, Why Me? Master Chief: Because You’re The only one that could climb to the top Patrick Stewart: Well we should have done it earlier right now. Master Chief: So let’s do it. (Patrick Stewart pick up Knuckles to throw him as he can) Knuckles: Alright throw me as you can. Patrick Stewart: Alright then. (Patrick Throws Knuckles as he can to reach to the top) Knuckles: YES!!!! I HAVE MADE IT TO THE TOP!
Patrick Stewart makes everything better lol
0:43 Tua never beating them Game Manager tag on and off the field
PS Playing the crazy old man character like in American dad is like his prime acting. It is so hilarious.
I dont know how anyone is gonna beat this
Did I just drop acid?
absolutely brilliant advertising...give the creator a raise
Sir Patrick Stewart is a national treasure
Love the animators and actors involved in this. It looked pretty cool.
1:46 oh f—k 😂
Mark Tremonti finally getting some attention!!!!🎸🎸
Knuckles: Why don't I just climb up and drop the rope to you? Patrick Stewart: Looks like someone doesn't understand football. Knuckles: Dishonor! Patrick Stewart: You say Dishonor, I say we throw the pig. Peppa Pig: I say we go with Knuckles' idea instead of having another one of us getting hurt. Patrick Stewart: Too late, Peppa. [Grabs and throws Peppa Pig] [Peppa Pig crashes into Arnold and they both fall back down] Knuckles: Just give me the rope.
This is what it looks like when Captain Picard finally loses it. Q broke him!
This comment can't get more than 2 likes
Here before it gets famous!
john dooo
Lore accurate Chief could probably just grenade hop over that mountain.
I'm only here for Creed 😂
First ad I’ve seen that makes me want to buy the product
PEPPA NO
Patrick Stewart is a god!
I have watched this so many times today. It is the best thing I've ever seen
I find "Throw the child" being the only play in the Captain's playbook, disturbing. 😂
To bring the mixed metaphors to perfection it should have been Fore!
We need a part 2 of this please 🙏.  We all need part 2
Uh....Knuckles can climb walls, just get a ride from him? 😂
Just how high is the the promotional department?  I want some.
MORE OF THIS
The Josh Allen commercial was so much better he would never throw Peppa pig
Tua in the cold, this guy is doomed.
Never thought I see Patrick Stewart throw Arnold Shortman like a football
Oh man, im getting a childhood throwback seeing Arnold. Watched that show every day before school, lol
"And now Creed's here." I lost it.
This is terrible. But good shoutout to Hey Arnold I guess
This commercial is EPIC!!❤❤❤❤
I'm 99 percent sure chat gpt was involved in the making of this advertisement. I mean, how else could someone come up with this masterpeice...masterpiece.... COME AWN! 😂
Commercial of 2024
We got Knuckles, Picard, creed and master chief in the same video before GTA 6
Stevie Griffins dad being thrown ( meaning Arnold)
Peppa pig saying oh dear it's the funniest part
I never saw them point to Peppa LOL. this is incredible!
This commercial is genius!! I watched it several times in a row and laughed every time!
Poor arnold 😂
Way past cool to see Knuckles appear in this ad!!! Hope other characters like Sonic and Tails can appear in future ads too!!!
Best commercial I've seen in nearly a decade!
Knuckles standing next to Master Chief is one of the most surreal things I’ve seen this year.
Nah this the greatest fking commercial of all time. This and the bud light swear jar will forever be kings of the hill.
If Arnold is being featured in a new commercial... Does that mean that his show is being revived? I hope so.
I'm just glad that Arnold is out here STILL IN THE SPOTLIGHT after all these years! I love it!
LOL and the fun Ads begin lol
I would like to think they were all on set together at the same time making that commercial. 😇
This is Deputy Director Avery Bullock Patrick Stewart here 😂
Best Superbowl commercial of all time. Don't @ me
BARRYMORE SHUT YOUR FACE.
Can't wait for the Knuckles series.
Paramount and Nickelodeon should make a TV show with all their animated characters interacting with each other.
This is the pinnacle of Sir Patrick Stewart’s career. You can go no further my friend.
This is the pinnacle of Sir Patrick Stewart’s career. You can go no further my friend.
I love how half way through it, Arnold is 100% in on the plan.
That's the coolest commercial I've ever seen.  Patrick Stewart is a national treasure.
That was just...sad.
only Sir Patrick Stewart and friends (copywrite pending) could claim the best superbowl ad before the actual superbowl
Paramount and Nickelodeon should make a TV show with all their animated characters interacting with each other.
Gen X approved!!!
Knuckles maybe you should tell them you’re an expert at climbing.
whoever's idea this was needs a raise😂😂
Henceforth, Sir Patrick Stewart was officially known as the first man to chuck a child at a rock wall. May he forever live on it the anals of history.
Tom Lennon is taking a victory lap around paramount I see. Well earned.
Yes all of its amazing , Sir Patrick ALL OF IT ... But can we get a CREED appreciation post lol . So good to have the boys back !
Patrick Stewart: "It's the fifth quarter, and we need a hole-in-one before the 7th inning stretch" Tua Tagovailou thinking: "What the f*** is this guy saying"
Love these moments
Wow. This is incredible. Awesome work.
As someone that genuinely dislikes most Super Bowl ads, this may be the greatest commercial of all-time.
Whoever wrote the script for this is a genius omg
They should of put Stewie Griffin his head is shape as a football
Stapp & Tremonti, like Peanut-butter & Jelly.
This might be the best commercial I have ever seen
Officer Dangle!!!
And Creeds here
EAT THE PIG
Im... not sure what I watched
Knuckles x Master Chief, all my dreams have come true, I’ve succumbed to capitalism
So many things I loved as a kid destroyed by Paramount - all gathered here.
I CANT BREATHE 😂😂
These are my favorite Super Bowl commercials & I look forward to them every year. Please don't stop making these.
These Paramount Plus ads are the greatest crossovers no one ever asked.
This is clearly aimed at an age demographic of anywhere from 26 - 35. Using Professor X, Hey Arnold, creed, Casey becker, dora, and that dumb pig 🌶.  🥱
Whoever scripted this commercial was a genius and a trailblazer. We need a full screenplay from this person. It'll be the next big box office hit.
This is the greatest commercial I’ve ever watched
This was insane in all the best ways.
LOL Captain Picard dissing Tua. I'm dead. 🤣
If Uncle Rico was there, he woulda thrown that kid over them mountains...
Creed is about to have a comeback year. 😂🤘 I'm not mad about it.
This is about to hit ifunny like a Nuremberg trial
Whoever made this commercial deserves a raise this is gold 💯
This is epic. 😂❤🖖🏻
I'm here for Knuckles lol
Knuckles can just climb up the wall
Roll Tide!
LOL at the use of the 6 Million Dollar Man sfx when Stewart releases Arnold
I heard Creed and immediately started tearing up with joy… 🥹🥹
From acting to story arc this is a legitimately a perfect commercial.
With this commercial, Sir Patrick boldly go where no man has gone before.
I think that might be a "Roughing the Passer" penalty on Stewart. 🤣🤣
Do a part two and call in Uncle Rico to save the day
Imagine making a commercial so good people actually go look for it on YouTube
Tua still can’t make the throw in pressure situations 😂😂
🤣😂🤣🤣🤣
Just re-subscribed today, just in time for both the Grammys and the Super Bowl.
Knock, knock, it's Knuckles! ❤🦔
The possibility that Sir Patrick worked with one of Drew Barrymore's forebears is certainly non-zero.
Patrick stewart went straight to "we throw the child" lol
AMAZING THANK YOU
Brought happy tears to my eyes…..it’s perfection
Can we get an f in the chat for Arnold
Where’s the Thunder Road from Explorers or the F-14 from Top Gun?
This ad is brilliant 😂
They portrayed chief better than his own show
"And Creed's here."  Only Scott & Mark.
Am I the only one thinks that Arnold is cute with that football shaped head?
Patrick Stewart saying Tua "not built for the moment" 😂 that was hilarious even as a Dolphins fan that was too funny
“Not built for the moment i see”.  Just explained tuas whole career 😂
This is the best thing ever
I love Jeff Probst 😂 it’s still a crime that we can’t have him as a paramount profile pic
Why didn't they ask for Korra or Toph to Earthbend them up the mountain.
"Not built for the moment" was some serious shade 😂😂😂
Paramount comin’ out swingin’ this year! Watch out Super Bowl! This is an absolute masterpiece!! 😂❤
At this commercial earn you a billion new customers .
THIS is how you do a Super Bowl ad.
This is legitimately one of the most embarrassing cringe ads I've ever seen.
"It's the 5th quarter and we need a hole in one before the 7th inning stretch" is so a Sir Patrick Stewart thing to say!
The creed trump stamp 😂😂😂
This is probably the best Superbowl commercial I've seen in a very long time! Budweiser you're on deck 😂
Every time I think Sir Patrick Stewart is too prestigious for comedic roles, Sir Patrick Stewart proves me wrong.
Well actually....(pushes glasses and scratches neck beard) Knuckles can take the rope with the pick, climb the wall, and secure it (sniff)!
This is the Ultimate Crossover of all time 🔥
I just realized, Is Master Chief pointing to a Grappleshot? XD
😑
Please throw the next child. (Peppa is so mean, we laughed so hard.) “Do it!” ~Peppa
The way Arnold closes his eyes as Patrick Stewart kisses his head 😂. Like I have complete trust in you capt
Sorry Arnold, the tribe has spoken.
Sir Patrick needs a bionic upgrade, he is using old-school servos.
This a fever dream.
Hahaaaa.... not built for the moment i see
When your commercial is better than your streaming service
There are just so many things to love about this.  - BARRYMORE SHUT YOUR FACE - that ever so subtle yet not subtle at all diss at Tua - “And Creed’s here.”  - Also, Creed.  - Idris Elba’s Knuckles - Was the dude from Hot Fuzz or Super Troopers?  - PEPPA PIG  Literally just perfection all around, now if you’ll excuse me I’m going to renew Paramount Plus for another year. They earned it with this.
Im just...so happy.
One of the best commercials I have ever seen.
Funniest part is they make note that several characters in this can literally scale the wall with little to no effort.
I'm just here to give Tua some love. He was funny and putting himself out there. Whole thing was gold tho. 🐬⬆️
Patrick Stewart looking Tua dead in the eyes and telling him he’s not built the moment sent me
Peppa doesn't have Josh to hide behind this time.
lol @ chief pointing to his hand @:20
Did anyone notice that the music before Creed is from the LOTR soundtrack?
It’s friggin CREED
Now Biden is attempting to act… great…
Greatest superbowl ad of all time
The kiss on the head… 😂
This is amazing.  New boot Goofin and Knuckles is crazy mashup.
WAIT! How did they get stuck there in the first place?
"Not built for the moment I see"   Where's Zing bot because Arnold wasn't the only person to get obliterated in this commercial 🤣
This made me laugh as much as the M&Ms wiggle, wiggle, wiggle commercial.
I love how arnold went from super confused to lets do this!
This is a character mashup I never even imagined. This feels like a fever dream on a high.
Probably the best ad in every super bowl.
This may be the greatest commercial of all time.
“It’s the fifth quarter, and we need a hole in one before the seventh inning stretch.”   Even I know none of those were football terms! XD
I can’t believe Knuckles, who’s most well known ability is CLIMBING WALLS! not only stood by while this happened but endorsed it! 😂
Oh my God: They Killed Arnold!
The reason why it didn't work was because he was facing straight forward. If he was thrown from the side, then he would have made it over
Yall this is WILD, Creed in the background and everything 😂😂😂
💯 hilarious!
Reminds me of Super Bowl commercials of old. So funny.
Now that was brilliant. Well done.
Tua underthrowing in the cold on the biggest stage. Brutal reference
Millennial TV right here… 10/10.
Calling out Tua for the moment being too big for him...priceless
Patrick Stewart kissing a random kid on the head before throwing him just feels wrong on so many levels.
Hey look everyone, it’s AHHHHNUUULD
And they say Paramount+ is dying.. and possibly looking for sellers. If this commercial doesn't help them, nothing will....
This may be the greatest commercial ever. If I didn't get Paramount Plus for free through Xfinity, I'd buy a year of the sub. Thank you.
The world needs more Jim Dangle and more delicious, piping hot Arby's.
We've peaked as a society with this commercial. We can only go downhill from here.
Sir Patrick Stewart
I hope Jon Taffer will appear in the Paramount Mountain commercials. That would be accurate so F The Canadian brodcasters if they're the reason why Bar Rescue doesn't air on Paramount+ in Canada.  It's fun to see Jon Taffer taunting in the commercials and We can still have Jon Taffer in the Paramount Mountain or Paramount+ commercials no matter if Bar Rescue doesn't air on Paramount+ in Canada.
Possibly Sir Patrick's greatest performance
We need a Paramount Mountain series now! I wanna know if they threw Peppa
This is just brilliant! 🤣🤣🤣 I've watched this three times and got coworkers to watch it too. Sir Patrick Stewart doing this is top tier gold.
😂😂😂😂😂😂  i needed that this morning. Great job!
Tua has arrived.
They needed to not reveal that Arnold was there until they panned over to him
These commercials are a legit example of using all of your IP correctly
Tua doesn't have the arm strength to get above the cliff regardless lol
Best ad, hands down!
Ok now I want to see Jenny Wakeman in paramount mountain
Absolutely spectacular work.
ohhh my god this was hilarious
I can't hear what Jeff Probst asks Arnold? Anyone know what he asked him?
This is the best ad I’ve seen in a long time.  I can’t stop laughing.
When he opened the call sheet on his arm and it just says “throw the child” I literally burst out laughing. Who ever thought of this stuff needs to be promoted ASAP. Creed in the background is the icing on the cake! Commercial of the year already!
Hilarious commerical. I was hoping for him to say, "Shut up, Arnold!" as a throwback to one of his famous lines.
Finally a good commercial
How much do you want to bet if uncle Rico was there he can throw Arnold over the mountains.
Paramount Mountain goes from a friendly place where they just go around throwing footballs for fun to a place where they now have to throw the child in order to survive.
I love this, I just don’t understand why everybody releases their Super Bowl ad 2 weeks before the game now?
Thank you to the Texas Rangers for giving Crews and “Higher” newfound popularity in the pop culture consciousness
Best superbowl ad in the last 10 years
Paramount+ is the only reason I watched the NFL this year because of the easy streaming access. I don’t have cable or live in an area where antenna would get signal so I would never have the chance to watch the NFL.
We can't shoot movies like this 😮❤
Knuckles didn’t climb the mountain? Guess he did not know da wae
He also could’ve thrown Stewie Griffin.
😂😂😂 best commercial I've seen in years!!
Say what you want about streaming services, but at least Paramount knows how to be creative with their commercials and showcasing their IP’s
😆 😂😂😂 I just threw him higher 😆 🤣 😂
Great commercial!!!
Someone in the writing room must've been on acid
Probably the best thing Patrick Stewart has been in!
Paramount's Master Chief being here almost ruined the video for me, but then I saw him not taking off his helmet.  Gold star.
Why does the thumbnail make it seem like Arnold's about to get his neck snapped
Its...it's just one giant meme 😂 I love it
This commercial brought me a sense of a childlike joy and nostalgia few things ever have.
I feel like this leads to the moment knuckles learns that he can climb walls, like in the games. 😂
Finally my boy Tua getting some love!!
Best one ever!
They really did dirty to Peppa Pig 💀💀💀
Art. Pure art.  No other words suffice.
This might be the best commercial I’ve ever watched
Barrymore, shut your face!
This is great
Nobody mentions Lt. Dangle egging Stewart on and then pointing out Peppa... 😂
With Tales of the TMNT and TF One coming soon. I think it would've been awesome if they made another Paramount Mountain commercial with TMNT,Sonic, and Transformers characters in it imo :D  Any other TMNT,Transformers, and Sonic fans agree on that??  Also, btw I love the song Higher from Creed playing in this too because I remember first hearing this in a trailer I watched a YT video of from one of my favorite guilty pleasures from Fox called Don Bluth's Titan A.E. :D
This is absolutely one of the best crossover commercials ever made haha😂😂
Gonna tell kids this was Smash Bros
This absolutely made my day in so many ways
bruh i lost it when steward said tua wasn't built for the moment😭
The is fantastic lol!!
0:21 1:00 1:36 1:50
Bro Master Chief just casually pointing at his grappling hook like “uh….guys?” 😂
😂😂😂Man they tripped out with this & this is my 4th time watching 🤣🤣🤣
Quite possibly the best commercial ever made
Is your marketing department next to a dispensary? 😂
This beats the superbowl
Oh yeah
I can't stop watching
Wouldn’t “shut up Barrymore” be better since it would be closer to “ shut up Wesley”?
Commercial was already amazing but Having creed made this commercial 10,000 times better
Sounds like something Bullock would do
New boot goofin
This may be the greatest commercial ever made!
Now if only TJ was there we would see Tua and Patrick Stewart fighting it out in a Hall Brawl over who gets to toss Arnold
Run Peppe l!
Knuckles is right there..??? And Tua can’t reach the Mountain… tons of inside jokes … great commercial!
Paramount, you have my respect
These paramount plus crossover ads are getting more and more cursed.
I never in a million years thought I'd see Patrick Stewart, dressed in an old football uniform, kiss Anrold on the head and throw him at a cliff.
Even if tua had a football im sure he would still under throw it.
0:18 Helga: Oh crimany! How will that work?
1:12 Gerald: He's a bold kid.
This was unexpectedly hilarious!! 😂
Wow this is good and funny😯😂😁😄
where’s TayTom
KNUCKLES YOU CAN CLIMB THE WALL!!!!!!!!!!
Something tells me Tua's critics will use Picard saying "You are not built for the moment" throughout the rest of his career...
LOL! I never did drugs, but I assume it would be similar to this. Funny ad
Creed for the superbowl halftime
🤣
Okay that’s funny but why Creed like did I miss something?
One Small Step For Man, One Giant Leap For Paramount Plus.
Bruh only 470k views this commercial is golden and funny af 🤣 needs more love lol
Or you can just have Chief throw it or Knuckles climb with the rope… lol
Paramount keeps doing it. They keep making awesome and funny ads.
I like how Arnold doesn't even complain about being thrown
Still wondering how we'll get up there. 🤔
It's been a long time since I've seen a Superbowl commercial this funny. Give the Paramount advertising team an effing raise!
The kiss on Arnold's head and Arnold's eyes closing had me dead😂
This reminds me of a saying i once heard last year.🤔 "Gen Z entering working firld is gonna be the funniest and most amazing thing we experience to date" 🎉😂
Chief silently gesturing to his grappleshot next to Knuckles who can climb is killing me 😭
We love seeing Creed back 😭😩
Tua not built for the moment 😂😂
Shut ur face
Just make Paramount Mountain a show already. 😂
Move it football head!
Whoever had this idea deserves a HIGHER raise
1:47  Don’t let Caddy hear about this, he’ll demand a full on special.
This would’ve been way funnier watching it during the superbowl for the first time. Thanks for spoiling it 😭
Of course it's gotta be Tua as the QB and he can't make the throw. Because that's the narrative people think he is...  Great commercial don't get me wrong but as a dolphins fan I feel dead inside 🙃
Awful
Goofin’ Just new boot goofin’
Tua not being built for the moment is really spot on.
Surprised Sir Patrick didn't break Arnold's neck with a throw like that... XDXDXD
I don't know why but the wrist band with THROW THE CHILD is killing me 😂
Dude, I want to hike Paramount mountain. It looks like a lot of fun! 😆
I hope Arnold's okay. 😟 😟 😟
"Oh dear 😐"                           - Peppa Pig 2024
This is the first time ive ever considered getting Paramount
This has to be one of the best commercials I've ever seen in my life! Sir Patrick Stewart is an absolute treasure, and all other commercials should learn from this!
Knuckles encouraged Arnold to be thrown by Picard!
It's been 20 years since we last saw Arnold Shortman! I'm so glad they animated him in his original design just like they did with Dora a couple years ago.
Dude, Knuckles' major ability in the games is to climb walls. He's got this.
This is the best thing I've ever seen in my life.
Paramount is Wild for this. Calling her Paramore, using Arnold as a football. Pepa and beavis and butthead all in one scene too.
Never would I have ever thought I would see Arnold being used as a football on a snowy mountain with Creed playing in the background. Thank you, Paramount+! 😂
KNUCKLES!!
What kinds of drugs do you take to come up with something like this! 🤣
I think I regained a little bit of hope. Thank you, paramount
Simply AMAZING
I know Knuckles could’ve easily climbed to the top, but cmon. We all wanted to see Arnold be thrown like a football. Welp, time to butcher Peppa. I’ve been waiting a loooooooong time for this.
What?
Engage
Knuckles is here! Now we just need Sonic and tails to join the party. :D
Patrick Stewart telling Tua he's not built for the moment is very cathartic as a Dolphins fan.
YES
Was waiting for Godzilla to break that ice but wrong studio. Lol
Hope he got paid mad money
YAASSS 😂Throw Peppa still haven’t forgiven her for hanging up on Susie bc she can whistle.
This is legitimately the greatest thing I have ever seen. 😂
Hopefully bring back Saturday morning cartoons
Could this be a tease of bringing Hey Arnold back with new episodes????
I really like the small detail of Cheif pointing to his grappling hook. Like he'd be just fine he's just there for the show 😂
"And Creed's here"
What in the fever dream did I just watch?? 😂
❤ LOVE THIS SOOO MUCH!!! 🎶😊❤️🤘🏽 Poor Arnold. Leave Peppa alone lol.
Loved this😂 still not going to subscribe, but this was good!😂
I'm just happy that Hey Arnold is finally on the spotlight after all these years, even after the jungle movie didn't make expectations.
If you were to tell me that in the year 2024 of Christ our lord, we would have a commercial crossing over the worlds of Sonic the Hedgehog and Hey Arnold, I'd have thought you were insane. What a world we live in.
Thank you, Paramount. This is the hardest I've laughed all year.
How embarrassing.
KNUCKLES MY BOY YOU COULDVE JUST CLIMBED UP THE CLIFFSIDE
Odd that Sir Patrick Stewart is wearing... Number 1.
1:53
Throw Dora
Why not make the Echidna climb?
Arnold was destined to be thrown. The prophecy has now been fulfilled.
Arnold shortman
Sweet dear mother of Lord this is beyond spectacular! What an unexpected promo with an intriguing choice of characters
This commercial exceeded my expectations.
Knuckles
perfection.
lol, why is Creed in this? best ad I've seen so far
This is a fever dream
I legit kept saying that knuckles can literally climb walls. HE DOES IT IN THE MOVIE-
love this super bowl commerial
I’m surprised they animated Arnold behind held by Patrick very well.
Love this  i feel like this will be one of my favorite super bowl ads im sure
Never thought I'd live to see the day where Arnold, Peppa, Knuckles, Master Chief, and Patrick Stewart are all on the same screen. But here we are
"Not built for the moment" yeah the whole NFL knows
When I saw Knuckles my jaw DROPPED
Noooo Peppa
Where’s Aang, he could guide himself up the mountain and hold the rope.
This almost convinced me to subscribe
*5% of my brain:* Arnold's head finally has practical use *95%:* You forgot Knuckles, and that one time Arnold opened a window
Knuckles…Knucks…my echidna, for PETE’S SAKE YOU COULD *_CLIMB_*
Master Chief pointing out his grappling hook and being ignored is one of the best details in this commercial
Sir Patrick told a BARRYMORE to shut it. I cant even
🤣 Looks like Knuckles has joined the ad
This is so ridiculous. I love it 😂
This was funny and cool
God it sucks here
Yoo they actually got Creed in here!
Best crossover
Love how chief points out his grapple shot like “uh guys?”. Also would have loved to see knuckles take a shot at chucking Arnold at a mountain.
this is the longest he kept his helmet on hahaha
You know if Sir Patrick hadn't done the seven step drop back he probably would have had it
Not built for the moment I see...
Arnold was supposed to spin. Thats the entire point
If only there was a blue hedgehog 🦔 who could run up the side of the cliff
Master Chief literally points to his grappling hook lol
Sir Patrick finally sold out😂😂
😆😂
Creed being here is the greatest thing ever
Throw the child😂
The prophecy is fulfilled.
This reminds me so much of those old Cartoon Network bumpers where all the characters would interact with each other
Arnold 😂
I've never been so happy to see a commercial interupt my youtube video 😂 I had to come here and save this for later   I held it together until Creed came in 🤣 and then Patrick Stewart singing 😂 beautiful
Robot hamlin said Hey guys are you guys going to stand there or what me and notch just build the stairs in Minecraft.
Glad to see the guy from Tremonti Sings Sinatra getting some Super Bowl exposure!
Paramount+ & Knuckles
Long live Lt Dangle!
Tua!
Why y’all gotta do my boi Arnold like that!? 😂
Noooo not Peppa!
I just witnessed the greatest commercial of all time and now I can die happy ❤
Paramount plus is not worth it
Never would I thought that Paramount would have the craziest and funniest crossovers ever in history of crossovers.
This world is getting bizarre! 😁 Good commercial though...they even got Creed! 🎸
This commercial is incredible. Maybe the funniest commercial I've ever watched. Certainly the funniest in years. Well done by those involved with this.
We don't need the super bowl for the best commercials. I think between Peppa Pig/Beavis and Butthead and Sir Patrick Stewart/Hey Arnold and Creed... I'm good. You did it paramount...you monopolized the best commercial market ..you can take the crown from Doritos.
This is gonna make people feel nostalgic in about a decade or so
NGL best commercial I’ve ever seen 😂☠️🙌😎🙌🔥💯
KNUCKLES PROMO 👀
😂
I'm dying. This is awesome. Patrick Stewart is the goddamned best.
Tua!!!
I stay a paying customer of this app for the rest of my life if this is what the ads for it continue to look like
Whoever did this needs a raise. This reminds me of old Cartoon Network commercials where characters interact
When Paramount+ subscribers went up and Disney+ went down...
The same thing would happen to Stewie as well🤣🤣🤣 Wait a second master chief has a freaking grapple shot that could shoot all the way up there.🙄🙄🙄
Master Chief showed more emotion in this crossover ad than any given scene in his own show
I swear to God in all these ads there has to be some sort of lore
They should let knuckles climb the mountain he’s a good climber
0:53 Scott and Mark from Creed.
TV show Master Chief keeping his helmet on🥲
0:33 not as good as a "Shut up Wesley!"... But it'll do...
BEST SUPER BOWL AD OF 2024 HANDS DOWN 👑👑👑
😂😂😂😂
This is the best piece of content man has ever made.  (Commercial or otherwise)
I’m excited to see Knuckles Series soon
THEY GOT MY BOI, KNUCKLES! LETS GOOO  (This is genuinely a great commercial! I love these)
Knuckles carried this whole ad fr
It’s Ernest!!!
Patrick Stewart: what about a football shaped head? Arnold: now im wishing Viacom rejected Craig pitch for me!
it so unreal to see  knuckles and master chief in the same ad
Knuckles and Master Chief!!!
Nah, we need to see Sonic and Tails in one of these ads now 😂
They need to make commercials like this more 😭😭
"Master Chief, you mind telling me what you're doing on that mountain?" "Sir, Finishing this Add"
People aren’t bringing up the fact that creed returned into a Super Bowl ad 💀🤘
I’m surprised Paramount+ has not included South Park yet.
I love it so much!! 😂😂😂
memories of all the early youtube Anime creed music videos coming rushing back.
I love how Chief silently points to his grappling hook and nobody notices
Barrymore, shut your face!
Bad day to eat mushrooms 😳
How to tell when something is written during a writers strike 101.
1:48 racist 🐖
KNUCKLES!!!!!!!!!!!!
So glad to see my boy Knuckles alongside other popular characters in media
KNUCKLES  KNUCKLES  OMG KNUCKLES!!!!!
mein gott
The fact that someone at sega had to sign off on this abomination is hilarious.
The crossovers is killing me in this one. AHHHH!
If P+ is dropping fire like this today imagine what they've got in store for us on Super Sunday!
What is happening
This could save 2024. 😌
The collaboration we didn’t know we needed.
its good seeing my boy Tua !:)
Knuckles 😂😂😂
ALRIGHT!! KNUCKLES THE ECHIDNA!! 😃
Never thought I'd see the day that Professor X threw Hey Arnold with Master Chief watching and Creed playing in the background
I'm just surprised that Master Chief is actually wearing his helmet in this
If only Uncle Rico were there.
Ok this is awesome
well this just made my day
Dang. What happened to Dora?!
That is hilarious commercial ever
Tua!!!!!
This is how I envisioned 2024 when I was in the 90s
Why did Arnold close his eyes when he got kissed? lol
Peppa cacusally being more funny in a ad that her tv show
They could’ve used stewie griffin since his head a football
This is why I watch the Super Bowl... Also I'm just there for the food.
This is the most personality peppa pig ever gets
Peppa saying: oh dear🙁
wait can't knuckles climb walls with his spike fists?
Knuckles is awesome and badass And epic and cooler and best character too he is my favorite character too in the world
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
I wish other studios can make a scene where their characters interact with each other
Hearing Sir Patrick Stewart say ‘throw the child’ is something that I never knew I needed.
What is this😭😭😭
Poor peppa
THE KNUCKLES SHOWcIS NEAR
man, peppa cannot catch a break it seems 😂
KNUCKLES
Paramount executive to writer's room: "There are no limits for this advert." [several nods] [Exec grabs shirt of one of the writers, lifting him off his chair] "Did you hear what I just said word queen? I'm talking Gremlins 2: The New Batch. NO. LIMITS." [Shoves writer back into chair, swings up onto penny farthing bike, pedals out of room]
Um Arnold agreed but let chief show you how to do it now halo infinite wise he can do it
This is hilarious
This made my day. Paramount. Thank you. This was hilarious and awesome!
1) Peppa  2) Arnold
Call me Knuckles Unlike Sonic I don't chuckle.
So what's going on? Are we getting a big cross-over film ala Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and Chip & Dale: The Movie?
I'm glad they brought back Arnold.
😂😂😂😂😂 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀 after all my childhood years, I would never think that they would finally use him for what his head really is a football😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 the song doesn’t help at all. This is too funny😂😂😂😂😂😂
Congratulations. You have created the greatest commercial in history.
Paramount + &Knuckles
Live action Fortnite looking pretty neat
What's ironic is that Knuckles is perfect for gliding and wall climbing, and yet, they throw Arnold! 😂
1:46
knuckles!!!!!!!
Not the crossover  or commercial was expecting today
This is art.
Seeing Arnold’s reflection off Master Chiefs helmet makes me believe anything is possible
🤩KNUCKLES IS HERE!!!!🤩
NOOO PEPPA!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭  Also, not sure if this is important or not, but KNOCK KNOCK IT’S KNUCKLES 🥶🥶
Paramount's fortnite 😂
Seeing Knuckles here just lit me up today
“Not built for the moment I see.”
Best...paramount ad...ever...
Hey wait...I just realized something! Knuckles can glide and climb up walls, right? Maybe HE can take them higher!
This, is by far the best commercial I've seen in years.
1:46 Peppa: Oh Dear 💀
Kmuckles' appearance is the best part of this ad.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
PARAMOUNT SUPER BOWL        & KNUCKLES
Football Arnold                & Knuckles 💀
Knuckles could’ve climbed that mountain.
Way to MOVE IT football head!
You got Master Chief, a super soldier that can flip an assult vehicle with no issue. And Knuckles, an alien super echidna who has punched through stone and metal as easy as drywall.  And you let the old guy throw Arnold.
They forget to add Patrick Stewart's appearance which is Star Trek: Picard and Creed's appearance which there isn't really any content that features them
Knuckles 😂
Poor Arnold. He almost made it.
this is not an accurate portrayal of paramount plus. It wasnt interrupted by 3 separate 4 minute long commercial breaks
Pretty dumb, really.
What just happened?
Everyone: lets throw the demon pig Peppa: 😨
To me, this was hilarious!  Great to see Sir Patrick being ha-ha funny.
This is like the dreams I would have when i was child.
Brilliant spot!!
Bro Knuckles literally just sat there and let them throw Arnold like he didn't have any kind of method to get up there himself ._.
I’m EXCITED FOR THE KNUCKLES SHOW
Someone give knuckles his shovel claws, he'll make it through, no issue.
This feels highly reminiscent of the Kids WB crossover segments and CN city, so thrilled this is keeping tradition.
Higher is the perfect song for this. The writing team was clearly high af!
0:18 Football Head!!
Does Paramount own Sonic?
Who voices Arnold in this commercial: Zane VanWicklyn, Ethan Thomas Jung (in which I expected this), or someone else? EDIT: Arnold's actually voiced by Logan Bailey, who played Pandy Paws in the DreamWorks Animation/Netflix television series "Gabby's Dollhouse".
i cant wait to have this shitpost air on tv for millions
Paramount won with this one hands up
I see Knuckles!
That service is formerly known as CBS All Access.
Thanks for being back the memories !!!!
Man, if only there was someone there with the ability to Climb vertical surfaces...Knuckles can you think of anyone?
Why can’t this become a series???
I'm here for the "BERRYMORE SHUT YOUR FACE" Finally someone said it! XD
More entertaining than most of the content on the platform. Next time: punt. Punting achieves much higher heights.
At least master chief has his helmet on for once
Guys, you have someone who can climb up walls with you!
bro knuckles can climb...
KNUCKLES
Let me tell you what WASN’T on my 2024 Bingo Card… EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE in this masterpiece of a commercial!
Arnold: are you threatening me ?  Knuckles: MOVE IT FOOTBALLHEAD!!
the delivery on the "we throw the child" line Sir Patrick Stewart is a treasure 😭
This is an average Fortnite lobby
Hey look it's knock knock it's Knuckles!
Nickelodeon's Arnold, Master Chief, Knuckles from Sonic the Hedgehog, Creed. 💚💚💚
Hey Arnold! And Dora!
Finally, they acknowledged Knuckles!
Paramount + really deserves their best funny commercials ever when it comes to Super Bowl countdown 🤣 mainly for Sir Patrick Stewart and Paramount (including Nickelodeon) gang
Knuckles can glide and climb tho
Knuckles could have easily just punted Arnold up there
Man these just get better and better! You thought Mr. Garvey's commercial was peak? Well now we've reached a new high, boys HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAA!!!
Polar Eyes Dora returns  Peppa finally gets a punishment.
My boy knuckles is here
Patrick Stewart throwing my boy Arnold was not on my 2024 bingo card.
Needed more spiral
Since we saw Knuckles (next to FREAKIN' DORA AND MASTER CHIEF!!!), this indicates that we're going to be seeing the series soon.
looks like grandpa Phil and Grandma Gertie are not gonna be happy about this after watching that their grandson gets hit on the side of the cliff 1:38
OMG KNUCKLES
Is nobody gonna bring up an 83-year-old man kissing that child?
Ironically, Knuckles should be able to just you know... climb that.. But perhaps he was just too curious to see them throw a child.
Why cant knuckles just climb
So, this is why Arnold wasn't in Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2.
Football head
Lets be honest we all knew he was going to hit the wall
What.... what... is this.. actually happening?
I come for Knuckles
LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS! PROMOTE YOUR MARKETING GUY 10000X FOR ME!
Knuckles is here!
WHY IS KNUCKLES EVEN THERE?? DUDE CAN CLIMB WALLS!!
Why not throw stewie griffin, he has a football head?
Creed is in this?!😅  1:09 FBI: Ladies and Gentleman. We got him 👮
If only we had a bunch of babies who knew how to throw a bottle of chocolate milk around as if they were in the Super Bowl.
Why are these Paramount+ ads better than any other streaming services ads. Like remember when ads were funny and entertaining instead of cringy or lame.
This ad is probably one of the best commercials paramount plus has done. And since Arnold was in it, does this mean we’re getting a revival, since most characters in the commercials are from current or popular shows?
Let’s go knuckles!
Paramount makes the best commercial and I love this song, 🎶can you take me higher🎶
Captain Picard: Engage.
Paramount Plus and Knuckles!!!!! 😎
That looks Awsome man
I'm just sad that we didn't get to see Patrick Stewart Yeet Peppa Pig too.
If Helga was there he would have killed Captain Picard for throwing Arnold because no one messes with him but her plus she has a crush on him
This is brilliant marketing
😏 throw it
Where tf is Josh. 😢
Creed is the cherry on the top of this commercial!!❤
Arnold’s head was finally used for something and it wasn’t the best idea to throw him even though his head is shaped as a football
Picard showed more backbone here than he did in season 1 of his own show lol  But seriously, I love promos like these.
nah what knuckles doing with chief and Arnold
Who's that CGI little girl?
knuckles *laughs in silence knowing he can climb the wall*
I do have to say this ad is hilarious. But come on, they have knuckles. I think they should have gone with him instead of throwing Arnold😂
Patrick Stewart: "It's the fifth quarter, and we need a hole-in-one before the 7th inning stretch" Tua Tagovailou thinking: "What the f*** is this guy saying"
Knuckles Is Finally Here Yes I want sonic and tails to be in the next one
Could of used Knuckles to climb the mountain 😂
Is knuckles the echidna he's here everyone!
Yeah that was phenomenal 🤣.
here I come rougher then the rest of them the best of them they call me knuckles unlike sonic I don't chuckle I rather flex my muscles
When will Zim and Jenny appear on Paramount Mountain? It'd be funny to see those polar opposites interact!
1:51 Looks like it's safe to say that Peppa is finally getting what she deserves.
Alright I’ll admit that was pretty good
knuckles and peppa pig have canonically interacted
I’ve been waiting for another Tua ad
This is so cursed on so many levels and I love it
CREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEED
When will Sonic join the party?
Arnold almost sounds like Kid Gohan
Knuckles meet Arnold, Arnold meet Knuckles
PEPPA NOOOOO SAVE HER
"We throw the child." LOLLLL
TOTALLY SAW IT COMING THAT ARNOLD WAS GONNA SMACK INTO THE WALL! 🤣 And my Boi Knuckles is here too in honor of his new series! Knuckles TOTALLY could've climbed that mountain with his spiky hands, but that wouldn't have been nearly as funny as throwing Arnold!
This is the pinnacle of Sir Patrick Stewart’s career. You can go no further my friend.
Master Chief didn't speak a single word for the entire thing. He's more game-accurate here than he ever was in his own show. 💀
Awesome 🤩
Why did they do Arnold like that?
I just woke up too early and I'm a bit out of it. Is this real or am I sleep deprived?
You know I personally always felt that Arnold’s head looked more like a watermelon than a football  Poor Arnold XD
KNUCKLES!!! HI!!!!!!❤
Fun commercial but knuckles could climb that mountain
Tua getting called out by a streaming service...
Is that Dora?
Knuckles can literally climb..
We finally got another look at the Knuckles show and Sonic 3!! These Paramount+ commercials are never not awesome!
It's even funnier that if you know the series the plan would have worked if they threw knuckles instead!
The Professor X actor throws Arnold like a football.
Um, Technically isn't throwing an animated child Child Abuse? this might have been a bad call on Paramount's part.
Yay. Knuckes is here😊
So Knuckles forgot he can climb up walls?
I love this!
Master Chief, you mind telling me what you're doing with Knuckles the Echidna in a Paramount+ advertisement?
“And creed’s here!”
👍🤩👍I’m glad they included Arnold in this Paramount + add.
Oh. Dear.
Is this real life or is this Fortnite? Am I seriously watching Master Chief and Knuckles stand side by side with each other while Professor Xavier throws Arnold.
0:19 Hey look it’s knuckles!
YEAH, KNUCKLES JOIN THE MOUNTAINS IN HIS OWN SHOW, 🤩🤩⭐️⭐️🔥👊
IT’S KNUCKLES0:19
KNUCKLES
Knuckles can climb the wall… lol
This is unhinged and I love it.
I wonder how helga pataki felt about this😂😂
"If only we had someone who is known for scaling walls!!"  Knuckles The Echidna, Sonic The Hedgehog supporting character famously known for gliding AND CLIMBING ANY VERTICAL SURFACE WITH HIS KNUCKLES: *stays silent*
Guess nobody knew that my boy Knuckles can CLIMB WALLS.
Never know Knuckles here qs upcoming his own series
Can’t Knuckles just climb the wall with the rope?
They 100% missed the golden opportunity to use Al Bundy. He once scored 4 touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High Panthers in the city championship game.
Seeing Knuckles from the Sonic Movie just made my day.
"BARRYMORE SHUT YOUR FACE!" 🤣🤣🤣
Bruh knuckles can literally just climb since that's one of his powers
We getting a Hey Arnold reboot too??!!!!
"We throw the child." -Captain Picard, 2024
I bet everyone’s only here for Knuckles.
Helga Pataki would've be mad if Picard thrown Arnold like that. Is that Kunckles?
WE GOT OUR FIRST SONIC MOVIE CONTENT IN ONE OF THESE WE ARE GETTING CLOSER TO THE INEVITABLE TRANSFORMERS X SONIC CROSSOVER WOOOH!!!!
YOO KNUCKLES
Knock knock it's Knuckles
Seeing Knuckles and Master Chief on the same screen was the closest thing we ever got the Sonic the hedgehog and Halo crossovers
Knuckles pretending he can’t just climb up there 😂
I love how they are getting ready for the Super Bowl, especially the fact that ARNOLD AND KNUCKLES are finally there😁!!!!
Easily the best one!
We need a hole in one.😂😂😂
PLEASE LET THERE BE A KNUCKLES TV SHOW TRAILER AT THE SUPER BOWL!!! 0:20
These paramount plus commercials are easily some of the greatest commercials in recent memory
Knuckles you can climb 😭
This NEEDS to be an actual series!
tell me thats a idris elbla as knuckles in that commercial because i'm ready for knucles echidna on paramount plus
It was good to see Arnold make an appearance in this commercial. Oh, and Knuckles, too.  Hopefully we get to see more Nickelodeon characters appear in these Paramount Plus commercials such as Jimmy Neutron, Timmy Turner, Danny Phantom, Zim, and many others.  Peppa Pig: "Oh dear…" 😏
RUN, ARNOLD!!
My god this was hilarious
THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A SUPERBOWL AD; simple, effective, and most of all; HUMOROUS
OMG,Arnold?? He’s in Paramount!! Even Knuckles too my gosh my favorite childhood of Hey Arnold. This is AWSEOME 😆!!!
Welcome To Paramount Mountain, Arnold Shortman!
KNUCKLESSSSSS
I guess they'd expect us to forget that Knuckles can just glide & climb the mountain, huh? 🤨
YOOOOOOOO, ITS MY BOI KNUCKLES LESSSSS GOOOOOOOOOO!!! 🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥❗️❗️❗️
The way Paramount+ is going Picard will be the only Star Trek left on it.
Poor Arnold & Peppa
Hahaha.
Knuckles
Is that idris elba as kunlckes to❤😊
This is the most Avery Bullock thing Sir Patrick's done in live action so far.
Chief just pointing to his grappling hook, and no one paying attention to him is great
That was the best Paramount Plus commercial!😍🏔️ Hey Arnold, Reno 911, Master Chief, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Stewart, Knuckles, & Master Chief are there!🤩 My brother is a fan of Knuckles and Master Chief!❤️ Also Creed’s Higher was played in the Titan A.E. trailer!😃
This is so amazing!💙🤍💙
Knuckles’ b-day tomorrow, His trailer needs to be unveiled tomorrow & release date 👊🏽🤜🏽🤛🏽🥊💥🔴❤️🤩🤩🤩🤩
KNUCKLES YESS
Knock knock, it’s Knuckles.
Way past cool to see Knuckles appear in this ad!!! Hope other characters like Sonic and Tails can appear in future ads too!!!
Captain Picard kissed Arnold.  and Arnold is singing Creed.  Let that sink in. 😂
Would have been even better if someone showed up on Appa.
Barrymore, shut your face. I just earned more respect for Sir Patrick!!
Arnold is finally used as an actual football after 27 years 🤣
Anyone else here wondering why Knuckles didn't just climb up there himself?
I thought I was prepared.  ... I was not prepared.
Knuckles can climb tho
I wish sonic and tails was here to on Paramount mountain 🎉
OH MY GOD!! KNUCKLES!!!
Sir Patrick channeling Bullock in this commercial.
This is the best and funniest animated/live action commercials I’ve seen from paramount plus. 🤭🤣🎞️ I hope they make like tv shows or movies with that type of collab, it would be a masterpiece. 😂
Peppa Pig: "Oh Dear" 😂  Love theses Crossovers in the Paramount Mountain, seeing Knuckles in here with Arnold, Dora, Patrick Stewart and Master Chief is Awesome!   Hope we get to see more of these and maybe see Jimmy Neutron, Tails, Zim, Otis, Ed and Dexter in here as well.
KNUCKLES???? trailer for the show soon??? Or sonic 3???
im wheezing
.
🤩KNUCKLES!!🥊⚡️❤️
Knuckles is enjoying listening to Creed!
We still need Patchy to join these commercials
Words cannot describe how insanely SURREAL it is seeing Knuckles, Picard, Master Chief, ARNOLD, and Creed on the same freaking scene together. Especially with what sounds like Arnold's voice actor reprising him here too.🤯
KNUCKLES
I’m surprised no one brought up the fact that Knuckles is a climber who could easily scale the wall in seconds.
Knuckles?!
That’s gonna hurt @ 1:39
KNUCKLES!!!!
❤❤❤
As Helga would say: “Criminy! No one messes with Football Head, but me! 🎀”
Optimus playing basketball next comercial
A Reno 911 cameo in the same vid as Jean Luc?! Breathtaking
1:40 MEDIC!  1:53 oh scrap
Paramount has the best marketing
Knuckles here too!
Almost made it over the ice wall on the flat earth 😅
Paramount and Nickelodeon should make a TV show with all their animated characters interacting with each other.
A list of voice actor Hey Arnold came back and also I'm glad we saw what the knuckles animation looks like
Ose dark garica : Knuckles come on man he just a cartoon ( 0:58 )
YEAH! KNUCKLES JOINED THE PARTY TOO!😂❤
I love it
Add Invader Zim Next Please
More crossovers! I would love to see a more of these in the years ahead!
I love this so much. Paramount plus has the best crossover commercials
