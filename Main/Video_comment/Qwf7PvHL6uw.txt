Cooking with an AP in the wrist, that’s some class right there
Navratri chal rahe hai..ab baad mai khaungi...
As an Italian I'm enchanted by this guy. He prepared such an excellent lasagna, in one of their classic version. The care Zach Choi puts into the videos (at all levels, audio, music, images, highly serious kitchen utensils...) is impressive and transforms cooking into an art work. I don't know if he deserves 27 million subscribers but damn, he's good at what he does. 😯😀

I enjoyed this so much until the first bite. Why did he have to stuff his mouth like that? It totally ruined the experience for me. That was way more than a big bite.

His one bite is my entire dinner lol

Such a great cook, love watching his cooking. He does great 👍
That was nice x33  You came here to watch "how to cook and eat the perfect lasagna" and we found probably the best ASMR cooking and eating video ever made. So inspiring Zach... Did I told you you re a GENIUS?
Are you a chef I would love for you to cook a nice dinner for me if you lived in the USA you are amazing

Diciamo che il ragu non si fa proprio cosi
I’ve never wanted lasagna so bad in my entire life…

Zach Choi is the best person to make me go hungry he makes the best ASMR content Creator
Zach is all the way in USA Meanwhile I'm in Cambodia suffering of hunger from watching bc of the food he eats
Zach choi: *done eating* Also Zach choi: *throw the leftover to Garfield* Garfield: NOM NOM NOM
my sister: wait MY BITEEE WhY DiD YoU EaT It
I am hungry now !
The lasagne is my delicious food
I love your delicious food send me one from Uber eats hehe
Garfield wants to know your location
Forgive me but what are y eating???what kind of food is this?its 1st time for me to see this
i kept saying to the screen "please be done! Oh my god he still eating!" the lasagna looks wonderful but just one dish would be enough.  Wow!!!!! 😲😲😲😲😲😲 How did you feel afterwards. You are so brave.
I love your content... I don't eat more than half the stuff but I still love watching you lol 🥰
🤤💖🤤💖🤤💖👌
Damn now I want lasagna I went from not hungry to starving in about 2 minutes and 4,45seconds
This is so delicious😋😋😋
where is the bechamelsauce??
Well at least he saved the other half for Garfield LOL :)
Now we know how dogs feel when we eat dinner
It's morning here so I might get lasagna
Bro
Happy crismaaasss
Very good ! 😋😋😋
I should try to make Lasagne. I'm not big fan of cheese either. makes me vomit. No offense to those who like cheese. Its just not for me.
I love the red wine in the marinara sauce. Fancy!
Bro ate faster than my brothers who eat faster than me
I like the eating, but you don't have to eat like a pork. Just take small bits on your spoon. Jesus!
His ASMRS make me hungry
Your videos are done so well. Everything from cooking to eating. I am making lasagna this week.
🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
If Garfield turned human:
Rip his stomach
Where's the chopsticks?
I'M SOOO JEALOUS!!
Muy mal no ordeñaste la vaca
Garfield Get your Lasagna Here
мерзкое чафкало
That lasagna looks pretty Good 👍🏾
I’m surprised he didn’t make his own wine at this point
Stop buying commercial eggs!! fact number 1, Firstly, to get the eggs they'll need to choose what chick can make eggs, those who aren't able to do that. they're  killed in some sort of a blender killing them instantly (idk they're killed instantly but you get it.), but sometimes they are even being thrown into the garbage can making them suffocate, fact number 2, if the chick can make eggs, the workers would put the chick in a beak remover, for some reasons i forgot why. fact number 3, after all of this suffering the chicks would be trapped in a small cage for their entire life.
Garfield would love to join you on eating that lasagna
I am surprised that he didnt mix hydrogen and oxygen to make the water
What is the point of eating this much food in one sitting? Can someone make it make sense for me? Besides money.
You should make it for Thanksgiving to go with your turkey
Master chef ❤
Okay, great food and cooking, but we gonna talk about how loud his breathing was lol
Lasagna has never looked better. Ever.

In the italian lasagna there is a particular sauce called "besciamella"
Its literally 12:06 AM
just loves how he treats his food and utensils with the respect they deserve
The presentation looks like eating lasagna in the forest😁🌳
Hs hs
Wine can u make lasagnas without wine
since you are both a fantastic pro chef and cinematographer, I have a question, did you go to college to to study culinary arts and cinematography, if you did, that great, if you were self-taught, that's even cooler!
Forza Italia
how can people enjoy listening to a chewing sound. i'm cringing so hard i almost throw up right now. looks real delicious though.
so appetizing
Somebody got some pull over you Zach because I know for a fact you could finish that easily. Someone wanted you to save them a piece 🤤
*Garfield Wants To Know Your Location*
Help my mouth is watering
"Garfield would like to know your location."
trash content
when I look in the title, it remind me "bi*ch lagsana"
The asmr sound is 🔊so satisfying!
Le lasagne? Bisogna che le vieni ha mangiare in ITALIA, la Pizza, i Tortellini, i Cannelloni
i called Garfield that you stole all his lasagna. Enjoy a fate worse than death.
15:03 omgg this sound
Save me some
this looks amazing also no one is talking about how he can fit a whole portion of LASAGNA in his mouth and eaten it all in 8 muinets
I wonder if he ever gets sick of eating such delicious foods.
I wish I had better stuff to eat like this but I only have uncrustables and pork roll Edit: that was me in the summer over my grandparents house lol I have WAAAAAYYY better food there now.
someone tell me how he got this out of the pan without is breaking because my mind is blown
Bang mabar ff gc

Türk var mı?? Bu adamı sevenler burada mı 🖐️ Çok başarılı değil mi üff ✨ Adam resmen hayatını adamış gibi önem veriyor videolarına
Isn’t anyone talking about the greens on the side?
Lasagna>steak never change my mind
Zack you are truly the best when it comes to ASMR’s! I could watch your videos like a series on Netflix 😂😂😂🤝 keep elevating man!
How can he eat such large portions and not make himself sick

I can’t even do waffles
The second melody tho 😩
7:18 Electric mixer break particle without releasing flavours ; mash preferabbly with pestle for flavour before using electric mixer.

Homie
,
Wow he used steak instead ughh that looks amazing
Ele faz a massa dele 💅
Bro just ate a whole lasagna
despite being slim, he almost ate the whole thing in one sitting. my stomach would be full and still far ahead than him. absolutely nutty...
He's beautiful.  I'm sure the lasagne was delicious.  But he failed to finish, no?
I like watching him eat because he seems so happy with every bite… I like seeing people enjoy food because I know I can’t eat one noodle without feeling bad…
Lasagna? Quella?! Noooo uno spazzatura!
U should try your favorite Ramen and and get sharacha with real mayo and canned chicken breast and mix it together. Very good.
What are thoes plants
How in the fuck do you eat all this food and remain skinny??‽ you must have an insane metabolism or ??? WTF?‽ no one eats like you and stays thin like you unless they puke up every meal afterwards!! Is that what you do???
Biggest crush on you
I was half expecting him to spank the dough
yuk bisa yuk open restaurant in indonesia hahahahaha

Non! On laisse pas les pédoncule de tomate qui ont l'air pas mûre et sans jus Le vin dans les lasagnes j'ai jamais vu sa a part dans le bourguignon en l'occurrence ce n'est pas un bourguignon.  Il manque laurier et épices carottes ou êtes vous??? O niveau recette c'est de la daube !!! Il manque la béchamel !!!
FINISH UR FOOOD
OMG i love lasgena it's so amazin
Anyone called?
his food makes me so hungry
😍😍😍😍
Yum! I'm eating lasagna right now :D
Zach ur not alone mate I made this with u and ate it with u so I didn't need to eat my phone 😂😂
My lasagna is with only meat but it is ASMR
Zack Choi's Channel is a Masterclass in Cooking and Mukbang. One of the Best Mukbangers. Just the Presentation of Video and Food is ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
WOW! After your 2nd bite I was full! You go boy! 👍🏽
Asmr makes me happy and satisfied 😛
That probably tastes like heaven in ur mouth
Jesus loves. So much he died for our sins and resurrected on the third day. We are all sinners and fall short of the glory of God.There’s not a single thing we can do to save ourselves for we are not saved by our works but by faith. Recognize that you need Jesus to be saved and without him you are going to hell. Giveyour life to Jesus. Confess and repent from your sins and accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and believe with all your heart and you will be saved. Jesus came to heal the sick not perfect so we all need him. Follow him.
I'm so hungry.. :O
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I AM STARVING
Why do all mukbangers have to eat like pigs?
This Guy is a madman, he even made the pasta homemade without even buying one on a store. Appreciation of the content you made bud🤣
I feel hungry 🤤
My eyes: impressed  My ears: blessed My stomach: depressed
love ASMR
Italiam lasagna?!? Ragù sause: beef and Tomatoes must be' cooked together..in lasagna no there ricotta cheese..but a cream called besciamella (: butter,  flaour and milk)
Impara a mangiare.
Cara, olha o tamanho desse pedaço de lasanha kkkkkkkkkk ele pegou a forma toda e tacou ali
I need some italian to tell me how good he did with the lasagbes
I love the fact he cooks  the food as well. HE NEEDS TO OPEN ASMR RESTAURANT. WHEN ITS SILENT AND YOU HAVE  HEADPHONES  IN AND YOU CAN HESR HIM COOK YOUR FOOD  LIKE PLEASE???
porca madonna
The way he eats is extremely gross and disgusting, but his cooking was good. He should just leave the eating part completely
How do burn the fat that you gain every week ?
Imagine eating that right before your mom calls you for dinner
The lasagna was Tooooooooooo huge and the 1st bite was amaaaaaaaaazin'..... Luv it, keep it up bro!  계속 형 !! ☺
Just pick this up with a fork 🍴 do you have to use your hand ✋ to pick up the lasanya and put into the fork 🍴
I've never seen that high quality tomatoes before
Ramsey in Danger 🤣
Me breathes: puts on 10 pounds  Zach every time eating food big enough to feed two families: gains one calorie
Don’t mukbangers ever feel to eat something like this on their own
fun fact when you make lasagna for your friends the more layers the happier they will become
You are a true artist and this is a masterpiece!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😋😋
omg he gul ped that down like it was  nothing
S
Z
Ssz
Cremyyyyyyyyyypeee peeee

Bunun Birde Tuvalet Kısmı Var😉
انتا عم تاكل مطابقة ( المكمورة )اردنية مو لازانيا 😂🤣
Yumms nice vid!
AAAAAAAAAAA  !Remember! Do not put mozzarella in lasagna, you not making a pizza
as a person with a sensitive stomach i would have to say this but my stomach as soon as i took that first bite would deny it and that is just sad.
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Mega
I Love this video 😍 woow 😍
Hmmm will t series eat this 🤔
😋
I am Italian, can I give you some advice?  next time try to make lasagna with fewer layers, otherwise it will overcook and it is no longer good, Italian lasagna has 5 layers, the limit is seven layers. (Anyway you did a good job✨)
Gordon Ramsay would be happy .
Zach Choi is to die for!!
I dont have words to say how beautiful looks that, youre really profesional... i just can say that
Sorry but this is not a LASAGNA🇮🇹🇮🇹
how does he get all the moth watering food
He doesn't smile but he's eyes do
Zach cooks for days and eat for seconds
Cada vez que veo un video de estos me entra un hambre de locos
Thank God the vegan teacher hasn’t found him  Anyways Ik we are all like: 👁👄👁                                                     📱                                                      🙌🏼  Starving is amazing (￣ヘ￣)  Us rn:   :’)
es ganda tanso, nem meteste a carne a moer
I’m somewhere between disturbed and enchanted
6:15 thonk
Me eat lasagna at lunch:can’t finish my 2nd slice of lasagnas  Zach:im done  Also me :what!!??
Vn
It’s like I can smell the lasagna through the screen (and yet I can’t). The video quality is so good it’s like I can bite the lasagna in the screen (and yet I only tasted sir)
He said the first bite is ours but it was such a big bite that the next thing I see is it’s in his mouth 😂
Garfield would be pleasure to eat this forever
Garfield is typing...
It's awful think that after all the first bites we gave, we still hungry, REALLY HUNGRY!
yum if only i had money i could eat food other than bread
Garfield : lasaga
what wine did he use?
he doesn’t need a wife , they need him as a husband
His neighbour is probably jealous
Excellente vidéo 😊! Les Lasagnes c trop mon plat préféré ❤️😋!!! Le meilleur plat au monde 🗺!!!!!!
I’m so hungry and it’s 6:10 AM 😫
Yummmm 😍😍
Cool asmr
Jesus loves you
Perfect
That first bite he took was ridiculous.😮🤤❤️
Must be stone cold the way he's eating it
This dude has one helluva metabolism and/or he exercises a lot after this mass consumption of empty calories or he's just starting out on his feeder journey.
Not only is the video quality and presentation excellent but the man really knows how to cook. these are professional chef techniques. thank you for all the effort you put into these videos for us.
Me: This man is so attractive.  Also me: Yells at my son to not eat so fast because it’s rude and gross.
Wah one meal rm1000
Wow. Everything from scratch. 👏 looks delicious.
Now I see why he's has over 12 Mil followers ❤

I Feel like he almost choke at this time 13:30
I like how he says first bite is all yours
Your making my mouth watery
He should have a separate cooking channel ☺️
The brightest smile ive ever seen in Zach face which indicates that that lasagna is delishhh. I tell you its really DELISHHH!   His face really shows full satisfaction after all the hardword. Bon appetit!
LG LG LG  LG LG LG!!!

Me italian:ok

😋😋😋😋😋😋❤❤❤❤
Just to let you know as of this comment being made his top 3 most popular videos are from two years ago    Idk if that’s saying smth or not

Jesus died on the cross for our sins He payed the price we deserved so we could spend eternity with him it’s all about  grace.
How and i mean HOW DO U EAT SO MUCH AND STAY SO SKINNY
Every body knows first bite isn't really ours🥺🥺🥺
The first bite is my whole plate I’m already full watching this
My tooth felt hurt whenever he moved the knife
Taste good I taste like nothing
Every time he takes a bite it feels like when you drink hot chocolate and your heart gets warm❤️
Garfield
I’m so stupid when I try act like Im eating the food with him to make my stomach feel better
Watching this video while eating lasagna, makes the experience so much better.
When you are eating lasagna while watching and scrolling through comments🤣🤣😂😂
Doctor: you ate what??
Him: First bite is all yours!  News: Breaking News A Person Ate Their Phone
How is he not fat
Apprezziamo il coraggio di quest’uomo a fare la pasta all’uovo
What's awesome about this is that he made everything from scratch. From the pasta to the marinara. No canned or preprocessed ingredients whatsoever. Brilliant 👏
Look so good.
I would do anything to eat some of that food 😭😭😭
It looks so fucking yummy,I- 🥺
I’m watching this video and I’m not hungry because I don’t like lasagna when I tell my friends that they say what kind of person are you
Jack Chan é vc
That looks delicious.
I'm eating lasagna rn😏😎
The music during the cooking ruins it….
Garfield be so jealous rn XD

John: Garfield, no- stop licking the screen
Plot twist:this video contains professional lasagna props.
That's enough food to feed a whole family
Me:feel hungry my stomach is dying

I never know what this guy is eating because my eyes remain focused on him :)
Thanks, now I know what to cook this Sunday!

Zach Choi tum tau zanawar hau
андрюша петров мог бы позавидовать такому вместилищу
My stomach just growled
I always make the stupid mistake of watching his videos late at night , I then become real hungry with envy and then I want to eat lol 😂  when I should be sleeping 💤 lol 😆
Zach s mind: I want a drink Ghost: I got you homie 13:34
And he should've had some garlic bread too if I was there I would have brought some
Everyone should already know that the food he makes be bussin 😎💅💅😜
youngboy eats food better + ratio

I love I love lasagna lyrics
Me standing here  wishing i can eat that
Me: watching this when I’m not hungry  Also me: *video finishes* damn I sure wanna get a snack
All of this… for lasagna which looks like it should be pronounced “les-ag-na”
the woman thats gonna marry that man…
You know you’re hungry when you go on yt to watch other people eat 😭🥲
Mcdonald's lady: hi, welcome to mcdonald's what can i get you today? Sonny: okay what do you want? Julian: Cheerios: Sonny: they don't have cheerios what else? Julian: lasagna. Sonny: lasagna? What the hell's is the matter with you?

😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋
🤤it looks so good
Garfield would be Jealous 😂
He needs to open a restaurant 😋😛 the food he cooks looks delicious 🤤
Que dahora ele mesmo faz as comida
Those lasagna look like the ones my grandmother used to do to me as a child. I'm Italian.
This is somethink like lasagna not lasagna ...
now you spend more time filming you making than eating 😐😑 .
Man Zach is a hella good cook
Why do I always watch this night I’m literally torturing myself-
Ti prego... la lasagna non si fa così.. Potevi chiedere a mia nonna te la faceva subito
in Italy, we don't put ricotta cheese in lasagna but besciamella sauce! its a common error... However, it seems very good. Bravo!
as an Italian, I'm very proud of the cooking!
No wonder he has so many subscribers.  This was INCREDIBLE.   🌟🤩⭐💫🌠
The music was so good I almost cried lol ❤
Okay. Now this is the best video.
That lasagna Is Good 🤗
He looks very satisfied like god damn
I would marry him just to listen to him eating all day
Sounds like there’s Italian music in the vid
Everyone else talking about their hunger: Me wondering How did he even fit that big slice in his mouth?!
I’m on a diet and idk why I love to see people eating when I can’t
Double chin 👀
Okay, few things. First of all why the hell there is italian music? Second - you don't have to take bites like this, right? You can eat smaller pieces and don't make a sound of fish without water.
I recemend hedphons 🎧
You can see the happiness on his face while he eats
Lasagna   😋
food is extra good when you spen all that time preparing it with such love and caution and happiness
omg the temptations are High
This is way too good to watch
He eat like yom yom yom Me what
Adorei!
😋 mmmmm, I ❤ lasagne 👌💯
This is called professionallity
이 음식은 내가 그것을 사랑 하는 맛 있다
*gorefield fans go brrr*
you have a big mouth
John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.”😁
He has 10 stomachs
*ALRIGHT THATS IT KIDS COME ON WE’RE GOING TO GET SOME SPAGHETTI LEFTOVERS*
🤤🤤🤤
Zach Choi: This is a little of Lasagna but it will do for 5 minutes. 😋  Zach Choi: I want 100 extra large quadruple cheese pepperoni pizzas with quadruple sauce.😃  Zach Choi: Those pizzas were a  ✨good snack✨...Time for more  Dominos: We are so sorry, Zach but you bought a 25 year supply of pizza☹️  Zach Choi: That was only a snack tho-🧐
Garefield is jealus
Me after first bite 👉🚽
He took that first bite and told me with his mind GOD DAMN that’s fucking good!
My mother’s lasagna is the best. NO QUESTIONS *ASKED.*  (But yours still look very appetizing.)
He is sucha good cook wow,
why did i almost cry while he was making this lmao the music and lighting makes it so dramatic and beautiful
Wa fraté tien o sfunnl'
This is what you call from scratch kids!😋😍
How many people can get food
Looks like my moms lasagna and trust me its delicious
That's the the world Huge lasagna
The biggest scam in the world is 10 hr of cooking and 10 minutes of eating
10:26 when it starts
Garfield is sad
Me wondering what the machine is: 👁👄👁 1:57  It all making since: 😑 2:56
Eu sou o unico brasileiro
I'm italian and i think you had make a really good lasagna
Zach how do you not get full , i wish I could eat that much
Check "1 Corinthians 15 :1-4"
Zach is the only mukbanger that I enjoy watching how he is making the food by himself..😁
Cometelo todo cotito
I like that circus music going on in the background.
Why's this free?
could u not do music next time for cooking videos?
mano eu nem gisto de lasanha mss porra w delicia
Yo al inicio del video:No se lo come 😏 Pero cuando veo que si:😮😮😮 Comoooooooooooooooooo
Presentation feels me relaxed.
Well i eat lasagna tho lol 😝
Zach: First bit is all yours  My stomach: Satisfied
✨wow✨
For American standard was good lasagna , but Our real LASAGNA WAS untouchable
OMG THIS VID MAKES ME WONNA EAT LASAGNA BUT NEVER TRIED IT O_O!
You literally edited this video I don’t believe you ate all that food 🫔🫔
This guy can make anyone hungry
Zach:first bite is all yours! :D News:Breaking news! A kid ate his own iPad!
*screams* I'm watching again why?
my fav food yummy🤗☺
as an Italian I tell you that the real lasagna is not that high, and another thing is that the lasagna is straight on the sides, no with these obviously this is not a criticism, and I am not a hater, they are just advice to be an Italian DOC as they say here in Italy.
yum
call it what you want but do not dare to call it lasagna, I don't know what it is and I don't know when it will come to life
In germany we say   fettsack
What did he drizzle into the sauce after he puréed it!?
it’s literally 1am and i’m so hungry after watching these it looks so good
I Love you Zach khoi asmr              İ speak turkish 😻
Can someone please tell me the secret to eating like this and being thin? I get exercise plays a part, but how much exercise and what kind?
Humm, Delicia de lasanha 😋😋
Sheeeeh
The lasagna looks delicious I wish I could eat that right now
-Garfield has Entered the Chat-

Garfield:John.. Where's My Lasagna?
Such a big ass fork dam my stomach is so triggered rn

Please Collaboration With Tanboykun😊
.
I wanna know how he got it out of the dish perfectly without it breaking or falling apart in him 😂
Mio dio perdonalo perché non sa quello che fa!
Underrated
Orrible
garfield: slowly starts crying
This has got to be the best lasagna I’ve ever seen.
I never sleep when people are the most delicious foods that I’ve ever seen 🤤
You don’t have to shove the whole thing in your mouth at once lol
I love how happy he looks while eating
Gente do céu
He love sprite
I am watching this drinking my vegan banana shake.
Invita culo
His first bite is my meal portion.
Nice
PEWDIEPIE  B**** lasagna
He’s so happy when he eats
Guys don’t try this at home Zach is a pro at eating
First video he has that shows him struggling with the first bite…nice recovery ❤️‍🩹 in the subsequent bites 🤓
A me dispiace che questo ragazzo non assaggerà mai la vera lasagna delle nostre mamme/nonne 🥺
Poor italian🥺
Garfield would've loved that.
Things I do when I watch Zach's Video's: 1. Suffer 2. Enjoy the sounds  3. Break my phone
Wow Zach, this lasagna looks stunning 🤩 and smells delicious 😋
Yumm!
𝕀 𝕨𝕒𝕟𝕥 𝕥𝕠 𝕖𝕒𝕥 🍺🍜🌮🥫
10:32 that sure is a big bite :)
Oaio
I’m here for Zach’s gorgeous face.😍
I have made a mistake: I watched it while was starving...
this is not a lasagna
I'm italian! The lasagna we make is not really like that, but you went really close to it, you know? Nice to see how we try to recreate our specialties! I congratulate you! Make great videos and your cooking style is great! You make me very hungry!
the intro feels like a movie
He is hyna ...... Smiles when he eats
Garfield would be proud
Since I was hungry and I can't go out cause I'm still 13 and Im not allowed at the mall I make a food for me I put macaroni pasta and I put tomato sauce and the whole pack of cheese cause his lasagna was so cheesy I made mine cheesy too😂 and while he was eating I was eating in front of him too....😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If I was eating that lasagna the whole plate is ✨clean✨ and you don't need to wash it XD
15:01 welp
I @m Italian 😢
Seriously you could take smaller bites ( but if you like such big bites then it’s cool)
I’m craving spicy noodles 😭
Ele cozinha bem pra krl mas que lasanha é essa que consegue desenformar sem ela derramar nenhum molho?? Se era possível eu n sabia.
Great vid! 😊 Don’t really care for the background music because it’s a little distracting for me tho.
Dude is anyone wondering why it was so small
I love how at the start of every mukbang video Zack makes he always starts a little tutorial on how to make the food first AND IT WORKS
My organizm feels bad someone helpme 😕😵
I saw him smile when he was chewing that😂😅😅😇😇😇😍😍😚😚
Loved every detail of this cooking class i actually belive i cam do this ...yes i will try it will be vegan though.
SO NOBODY IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE MADE ALL OFF THAT FROM SCRATCH🤯
i swear this man makes me so hungry at 2:30 in the morning, thats just evil
More than half of the video is the cooking of the lasagna, you can’t blame him though, it looks like I if I were to take a few bites and I would already feel like I ate 20 patty meals from whataburger
The begging kinda sound like Minecraft ngl
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍😙😙😘😘😚😚
No, noo, nooooo per Dio
The one that dropped off the second bite makes me heart break🤤
Hear me out... take smaller bites... you'll choke 😂😂😂
this isn't lasagna( questa non si può chiamare lasagna è uno schifo)
Bravo for the videography 👏🏻
nice❤
why did you triggered me like this, please finish your plate
Come ooooon, angles! Come ooooon, high def!
He never talks
Somebody get Garfield in here
This reminds me of the lasagna  tree in garfeild  i dont know why
Amici italiani fatevi sentire
Das war nicht perfekt gegessen : Kommentar von Saskia !
who likes sourcream with there homemade LASAGNA
Lasangna from a thing called giing ging
He makes money from lunch, what day will I be able to have these things?
Zach makes food once a month No one: here’s a million dollars
The transition of him drinking to him eating is probably a 2 hour break for him to feel hungry again 😂
nadie:los venezolanos viendo esto 💀💀💀
algum br ?
شنو من معدة عندك متكلي 😂😂😂
Shows this to my sister  Sister:i bet he will finish all of the food Also zach:And i take that personality

Why I love zach videos  1. They are very calming 2. They aren’t dramatic  3. Hand made food  4. Asmr on point  5.  Aesthetically pleasing  6. The quality is amazing  7. He is just an amazing person  <3
No one: Me: *Eating my phone because he said "The first bit is all yours"
Moin Meister
Fun fact: he is not Italian but he cooks it better than many Italians
Why in Ramadan
He eats this much how is he still skinny
the people that disliked are probably jealous that Zach got a better meal than them 👁👄👁
10:22 when he starts to eat
Sheesh I'm hungry in the middle of the night 😭
10:52
Woww
Our Italian lasagna is amazing
Garfield sould be watching this

krl mlk come com a fome de 10 mindingo
How can y stay your weight
Stopped watching 5 months ago, came back and the production is better than most hollywood ones
I'm just sad he didn't finish it :(
I really don't like lasagne but somehow he makes it look amazing
I feel like he went through all this trouble so that the comments won't only be filled with unhappy Italians
달콤한 시간
My mouth is watering
I love the video, i love asmr but i am italian and this is not a lasagna
Io sono italiano e vedo questo video piango
Lasagna is my favorite food and im jealous
how does he maintain the weight he is and not be fat
I bet we dont wach this for the asmr we just watch it to see him eat food
i extremely love it that you put things like 5:00 in your videos, it makes everything so much more satisfying
Shut up, the first bite clearly isn't ours 😂
You're making foods videos are better than a ad
😋😋😋😋😋
People who watched this in full volume with their earphones on are legends
Lasanha
Most importantly it’s captured in 4K
😳👌
The quality is higher than my good grades 😭🖐️
Zach: first bite is all yours Me as muslim:no thank you
おいしい ：）
Que vídeo incrível e lindo! ❤️❤️
Who else is watching this during Ramadan?
I cant be the only one who bites the air when he says "the firstbite is all yours"
POV: your trying to eat normally but you see somebody eat good food, and now you think you need better cooking skills.
Are you Korean???
Qioq
I think what entertains the most is just watching zach cook in a relaxing cinematic mode😎
Gob**k
paingi
Its like cake
“Look at t series they’re just crying for their momma”
I love zach LASAGNA  tysm💓😁😘😋
Look down its cool        360p = 0.7 mbps 480p = 1.1 mbps  720p = 2.5 mbps  1080p / HD  = 5mbps 4k = 20mbps To see kbps on YouTube go on stats for nerds  144p = 80-100 Kbps 360p = 400-1000 Kbps 480p = 500-2,000 Kbps 720p (HD) = 1,500 Kbps 1080p (HD) = 4,000-8,000 Kbps  4K =  18,000-14,000 Kbps
Ele é a representação  viva da expressão saco sem fundo
How is that possible???

This guy did not just ate and left no crumbs, but he also showed us the cooking process of this beautiful lasagna.
ALGUÉM BR 🇧🇷🇧🇷
Garfield wants to know your location.
Zach Then : Cant Even Resist Looking At The Camera, Even He Is Eating Something Require's Big Bites  Zach Now : Look At The Food Everytime  A sad reality :(
10:46 Zach: *happy* Me: *happy bcs Zach is happy*
He must be real thirsty. Really disappointing that he didn’t finish. Looked amazing though.
greenwich could never lmao
When the cooking took more than an hour than the eating*  :Life is truly cruel
why do koreans have to use these fat wooden forks and then also put these big fat pieces in their mouths making it quite grotesque? instead, take the big fat pieces as you like, but use normal metal THIN forks, and it will looks less stupid, because you drop food everywhere, you can barely chew and it looks quite awful!!! Ohhh... What?... everybody likes it? well, I bet you, none of them eat like this, they all use normal forks and spoons and do not have distended lips and mouths from forcing too big pieces of food impaled with horrid wooden forks or spoons.
que fome da poha
이것은 너무 많이 만들어졌다 ❤️
くそまずそうw
Something in tasty language
Set speed 2X
My man implanted a microphone in his throat.
The is no way that whole slice fit in your mouth🤨
4:33 just found out that tonatoes can be peeled
Ok but lasagne are made with besciamella, not with ricotta and mozzarella
Zach Choi : inhales evey thing   Other people : Chiles O  the smallest bite
Now this guys makes moneeeeeyyy but his Mikva game are awesome.
What I’m wondering is how he got the lasagna out of the glass container 🙀
Amazing who else wants lasagna?
This video quality is amazing. He made his own pasta!
Gordon Ramsey who?
🇮🇹ITALY🇮🇹LASAGNA

Omg
10:21 where eating process starts
Me(italian):I show this Lasagna to my granny  She:GET OUT OF THIS HOME
perfavore non aspirare aria quando metti il cibo in bocca
I gotta give this dish a try! I'm sure my nine other siblings would like this, and I'm tired of eating the store bought kind...
10:34
Dude thank you  I have to cook lasagna for my homework and ya just saved me
Anyone else hate Zach for no reason other than the fact that you are now starving and want lasagna
I imagine Zach as the type of person who takes all his leftovers ( if any) to a homeless shelter or gives them to people on the street. He seems like such a sweet genuine person 🥰
Wuw
This vedio is made for Garfield 😼
ебалн вилка есть для таких целей
OMG pleeeeaaaasssseee give me some of that Lasagne!
This is what people who HATE lasagne start to do: Muuuum! I want lasagne! ~ Basically, they CRAVE for it.
Me: Wooooaaaaaaah! Thats a lot of lasagne!  Zach Choi: Eats massive 3 bites (About how much I would eat in total)
Who else Wanted Lasagna after Watching this
In my house we have 11 members so we get the piece equal to his one bite😅
Im italian and this lasagna is perfect 🤤🤤
Zach:the first bite is all. Yours:D proceeds to eat it
The quality of the filming the cooking the presentation *chef’s kiss 🔥🔥 if only we could taste it 🤤
This guy is so amazing
I loved the video, keep it up
You eat too much Zoch but it looks cool
You are rich Zoch
Damn act like u havent ate in 1 year
Not only is Zach Choi a great content creator but also a great chef
È inutile che la chiami lasagna e metti la musica italiana.. non è una lasagna per quanto mi riguarda puoi anche metterti una canzone rap mentre la fai
A lenda é q esse cara passa 1 mês sem comer pra fazer video pqp
If we had to survive for a long time he would never starve
Oh my gosh with this first bite oh my God it looks like he was eating some big marshmallow or something and his head shaking
I can watch Zach eat all day 🤣🤢
John wheres my dinner
Yummm looking so tasty
This guy is talented! I’m over here like impressed that everything here is homemade! Some so called Italian restaurants can’t even come close to this!
why i always watch these when im dieting.🤦‍♂️
Eh beh signori🇮🇹
How much do you think this thing costs? Looks delicious though
Cool🇧🇷👌🏼
For anybody who needs to know he bakes the lasagna 0:00 to 10:21 So he starts eating at 10:22
What is the music in the background at the beginning? The very first one.  Otherwise it was great
Tell me. Is he a chef in real life?
the plants are so pretty 🥰
Whenever I take dinner with full stomach with no space for air and if I see this video I get hungry😭😭
You dont know the bottle trick with yolk
yummii😍😍😍
I love he's intro tho ૭😌૭ ~satisfying~👌
I'm sad   I also had the first bite but it taste like air😪😔
That first bite he took tho🥲
I love his intros where he’ll just be making the food it’s so proper and just makes me fell so modern.
No one: Mha fans: Don’t show this to Fatgum
my fav food is lasagna
Everyone: how did he know how to make that  Me: *goes to subtitles
نمیترکی انقدر میخوری؟؟؟😐

IT LOOKS SO GOOD BYE
Start at 10:30
How is he not fat lmao
If you Asian and can cook like this hmu 💀 jk... unless👀
Definitely watch CBN's utube videos about financial freedom, in these videos people share about when they started tithing to CBN they started experiencing financial miracles of wealth. Now they tithe to CBN from a prosperous wealthy income.  Also read miracle testimonies on Joseph Prince's Ministry website and Benny Hinn's Ministry website. Some are about financial miracles. One of my pastors he preaches about his health and financial blessings of tithing to Voice Of The Martyrs Ministry. It's another great Christian global outreach ministry. 🤔🤗🙏
Tiger + Rabbit = Rayger 😊😊😊
This is pure art

Great video quality! 💣 💯

its pissing me off that i DONT HAVE THAT LASAGNA IN MY MOUF‼️😩🤤🤤
Zach: oww excellent  Me: Me watching the screen with his mouth open🤤🤤
Looks like a cake
When millions of people around the world are food insecure this ridiculous display of gluttonous eating is disgusting and disgraceful.  If you have to resort to this for entertainment - get a life.
Where is garfeeld he has to eat it
Garfield has entered the chat ლ(◕ω◕ლ)
It’s like 8 am for me now, I should not have watched this. I might make lasagna for breakfast.
It's like I hate tomatoes but they be looking so good
You should have invited Garfield
Zach is an amazing cook, if he ever had a significant other, I don't think they'll ever break up with him lol. This guy is talented, aside from eating sksk
I feel so elegant watching this. Like I need a glass of wine and classical music playing in the background lol
Whoever watches this....get professional help!! NOW
When people put their lives in danger over a channel i could never
I love the Italian music in the back
Please stop eating. First thing is to drink vegetables smoothie in the morning or eat fruit to cure eating disorder. Pls care about urself. Pls dont kill yourself
He makes an asmr video seem like a movie
thèm vãi truởng lun :>
No garlic bread or wine
I mean he
She’s the best maker and Cooker
The fact he didn’t smack the dough 😒🤚🏽
This is more better
Find someone that looks at you the way Zack looks at his food 🥰
What a masterpiece!!
Секрет 🤫 в том что он питается 1 раз в день )

YOUTUBERS  who eat MASSIVE food on their platform and call the video a MUKBANG that WASTES or don’t finish their food are 👏🏾 disrespectful👏🏾 to👏🏾 CULTURE 👏🏾
yummy
Thought it was a cake at the thumbnail

My  parents thinking: I am wearing headphones bc I am watching 🔞     Me:Watching Zack eating lasagna with my diet cola 👁👄👁
WoW
I'm a Italian boy mamma mia I love your video
If you grind meat try to grind half frozen meat so the protein and the fat wont get destroy by the grinder Btw i love your videos☺️☺️☺️
Lasanha😋
Deu até água na boca
Garfield gonna find you and eat that lasagna
THI IS NOT A LASAGNA! WHY  THE BOILED PASTA WHY????????? THIS IS ORRIBLE FOR ITALAIN!!!!
why the food is always not finished
Sono ľunico Italiano in questo canale?
what a satisfying video to watch... and WOW, this looks delicious
the most i like about this vidèo that he cook with himself
E questa sarebbe la lasagna???? NON NOMINARE IL NOME DELLA LASAGNA INVANO!!! VICHINGO!!!!
Seriously you can see it's not an easy job he eats the whole lasagna and if he straight go to bed and he'll be fat. Maybe he spent 4 hours in gym after eating thats why he has perfect body.
If you are Hispanic or Italian in a fashionable matter on a scale of 1 to 10 how good do you think he made this.  Lasagna
How many years of culinary school? I’m impressed
Knocked up a sleep
si lo pongo a 350 grados me sale carbon...

If zach made lasagna he would call it zasagna in my opinion

I'm nto trying to be rude at all the video is amzing I'm just saying that the first bite that Zach took was a huge bite i feel disturbed from that bite he didint even  save it it's just that he ate it in one bite  and it made me disturbed @_@

You tooooop! I like you video. Sori, i Rashen
I can literally taste and feel the lasagna in my mouth
then Zach.  you did everything right ... but then you fell on the FINAL!  you put the béchamel, NOT the mozzarella!  how does mozzarella come to mind?  😂 and why do you put herbs on everything?  😂 oh well for the rest all right good Zach
**Garfield has entered the chat**
Pero como puede comer tanto, con lo empalagoso que es la lasaña
Watching you fix this up is so satisfying to me & looks really really good 👍🏼

That looks sooo good I would eat  it all by my self it would take me a week or so but I don’t care
This is making me soo hungry, no lie
С первого заглота чуть не блеванула. Зачем впихивать в себя так много, впечатление было, что у него сейчас назад все полезет.
Watching this gives so much of satisfaction...❤️
Hearing metals & stainless things getting pulled, my teeth will starting to feel breaking. *I hate how it feels*
Wow
the cooking intro is like an kfc commercial
Dude, that’s a mountain of lasagna.....😋😋😋👍🏼

You're an amazing chief. I m very proud of you.
Watching this when you have no food should be a form of self harm
I watch only cooking part
I wonder what he do after eating food that looks this good. Knowing me I’d take a nap right after 😂😂😂
Who else watching at midnight starving on some lasagna..
T-series!!!
3.7k people are jealous of either his cooking, good looks, filming skills or all the above.
5:20 did he cry when cutting the onion?
I love you
why the music in the beginning:( much preferred the prep/ cooking with no music
3:43 kayak jemurin baju bangsul awokawokawokawok 😂😂😂

How to say lasagna  Right: Lasagna Wrong: Lasanya
How is he fit after eating all this food?
Only if my lazzna would look this good
Man, Zach was smiling alot in this video
Ok can we just talk about the first half of the video on point
Am I the only one who skips to the eating  part😬🥴
Me watching Zach eat this with a bowl of ravioli and my imagination : 🥲🥲
I wonder if Zach ever thinks to himself “ Damn Im good “ while he eats
its the video quality for me
I love to have some 🥺 a bite through the screen ain’t enough
Garfield: Pathetic.
КрюютЯ 😉
i love watching your videos zach! Only thing I would like to see changed is the consistent social tags on the bottom. Its kind of distracting since I watch your videos full screen to fully appreciate your awesome editing & cinematic shots!!! Suggestion: maybe do a few pop ups with your tags to remind people to follow you!!!! Hope you see this!! Love your videos! 💖💖💖💖💖
6:15
So no ones gonna talk about the *height* on the lasagna- like damn
6:14 so satisfying
Aí dei valor. faz e come o q fez👍👍👍👍
Bruh. I'd be looking like Goku destroying that lasagna. Barely breathing but constantly chewing
Man 😔...... POR QUÉ TIENE MANOS TAN SEXIS!?? 🔥😲🔥 Literal casi convulsionó cuando lo vi amasando la masa para la lasagna! 🌚🔫
Well....he broke the diet.....😕
This is a killer lasagna
If my italian grandma watch this tall plastic lasagna,she have a Heart attack
Visual Art! I am so amazed at how much he’s improved over the years! If he ever felt like it he could most definitely be a Chéf.

He’s killing every one by making them starve
How does he that big
Oh come on lasagna is my favourite
That looks so delicious . Now I want lasagna ❤
*Garfield approved.*
his eating takes so long that when he's done covid will be over
People: eat to live Zach: lives to eat
this was literally like a movie production. had my full attention and everything
Zach needs to go on Master Chef 😃
5:14 I could feel my eyes burning 🤣 lol whaaaat.
Io ti adoro, sei sexy e il resto... Ma tesoro per ogni passaggio di questa lasagna una nonna italiana ci è rimasta...
I threw away my lasagna I had for dinner last night into the trash. Now that I think about it I feel kinda bad 😭
🔥 🔥🔥
I like it
❤❤❤
That was definitely more then a pound of lasagna that has to be like 3 pounds
Legends say people have died of hungerness after the video
Великолепно 👍
Exactly dude!
Anyone notice he didn’t narrate what went in after the onions?
I love to see him eating that at forest
can i gets sum looks bomb asfc:(
Best cook of the century
This is how many people want Zach Choi to talk 👇
I’m Italian, this is not lasagna but a rock 😓😓😓
Youtube: do you want to turn the volume up, u can damage your ears Me: *hell yea*
His camera quality is better than your eyesight.
Forget about his cooking skills and the food, just his reaction on his first bite brought me smile throughout the rest of the video. He knew he freaking nailed it. 😄
Clip very very very good
Sprite can is missing?
how the fuck does he eats this much and not get fat
Wow
Garfield found his right Owner
Why does your making process feel like a commercial ad😂
zach is secretly garfield
i appreciate that you made it from scratch.
I love how he makes all his stuff homemade.
okay but like, WHO TAUGHT THIS DUDE TO COOK
Subscribed!!!!!😋😋🤗🤗
*dies in diet Hungry*
Wow

You have gloves and you eat with fork 😂😭😂😭😂
teacher: don't get caught eating in class 👺 Children from the last bank with me:
I like how he shows how he cooks it and how he does not go and buy the stuff  Love you and your vids
Amazing video!
Zach makes every video into a piece of art
I like how Asmrtist and Mukbangers gains no weight while me breathing gaining 1 kg

I love how he smiles while eating, it just makes the watching 2x more fun.
Yummy 😋
Why do u dont get fat:?

Me watching this video: Hmmmmmm. *cracks 5 eggs and slams them on the bowl

dang why big bites tho o wonder if he threw up afterwards
This looks like the best tasting lasagna ever made! All fresh ingredients!
Mans fit a whole puece of lasagna in his mouth
Aaa rgrgrgrop chop chop slrrpp
caramba mano que isso
I like how at 5:01 the video editor purposely let the scene play longer as the oil merge together (instead of cutting it right after Zach finished pouring the oil). So satisfying!!
This is so satisfying and I’m very happy that Zach is able to eat this amazing food and gets money to support himself from it. He’s an amazing cook I’m sure and his videos are always very clear to have effort put into them. We love you :) !! 💖
Others: Zach Choi ASMR Me: Foodie Psycho 😜
What we want: asmr videos   What we get: a literal hunger making asmr masterpiece.
Ekelhaft, einfach nur ekelhaft
Jeez your videos have gotten way better keep up the good work❤️!

Gw salah satu orang indo yg suka sm ini YouTuber🤣
Guloso não vai deixar para os outros? 😡😡😡😡
Wow, Zach...this videos a work of art! I'm not sure what to be more impressed over..your cooking skills or all your kitchen gadgets!!! Makes me want to make a lasagna! We can tell from the look in your eyes at that first bite, how good it tastes!!!! Love watching the expressions on your face when you're eating....can tell you are really enjoying it😊👍
J'ai peur que ça finisse très mal D:
U rich?
O cara tem um microfone na garganta?
Now im looking with cocopops
How can u eat all that, its too much!!
Me just eating lasagna and watching plp eat lasagna lol
Whats the music ? 2:42
Bunun 3× i var mı yaa😡😡
honestly i really like that he makes his own food from scratch so often. knowing exactly what you're eating is always a good thing, especially if you're planning on eating largue quantities of it! (i don't mean to put any mukbanger that doesn't cook from scratch in a negative light. i trust them to be responsible with it too.)
Hi:)
Any Italians aprrove this video?😂
Zach please respond I needa know or at least someone, I needa know the songs you played in the video, it kept me so calm and it started to make me tired it kinda helped me sleep and now it keeps running threw my head I was hoping it was in the description but it wasn’t
I really like Zach Choi vidoe
OMG I FEEL SO HUNGRY
Dude this man gets to eat good food 😂
Como es que el no engorda ? :,v
Table for 2 maybe?
Dove siete,facciamoci sentire sotto questo commento:ITALIANIIIIII🇮🇹🇮🇹🍕🍝
That looks good but I don't think I can eat all of that I'm only 15 years old lol
Hello
E
Teacher : what do you want to do when you grow up Zach: make people hungry
Du und dein freund stingt nach wurst ekelhaft.
and so satisfying will to eat too
I love how he is focused for on quality than quantity
I hate how people call it sickening when he takes big bites. All of them have walls blocking their brains from functioning correctly. Think about it even a bad edit can take like 5 hours and these edits are amazing how long do you think it takes? And then there is the fact that he has to buy all the ingredients (obviously) And then there's actually cooking the meal which is like a whole nother' 2 hours or more  OFC HE IS HUNGRY IDIOTS THATS LITERALLY ALL THERE IS TO IT.
I want someone to look at me the way he looks at this lasagne.
Zacj should try the took too feta pastaaaa
me:One slice is now my plate     him:he takes one bite at lasagna.
Orucken bunu izlemek ayrı bir fantazi
The lasagna is literally bigger than my future- Edit : i absolutely forgot about this comment lol tysm for the likes guys !
How does he not die from this
ZaCh ChOi is nOw ItAlIaN bOi
if zach choi had any kids they would like dinnertime better then video games
we need the Grounding meat part lol
Very cool videos of him, the desire to eat
His videos are very good
Zakbo
Ma ndo sta la besciamella zii?
10:34
I like watching Zach because he gives me new recipes to try
Dá até vontade de comer
Best video ever
Insulti l’Italia 🤬🤬🤬
he starts to eat at 10:36 :D
Sayurnya juga lah ngab di makan biar sehat jngn di pajang doang
کیری
FRIEND : WHAT IS IT ME : COOKING SHOW
Is it me or I can smell the lasagna
오ㅎㅇ?
Imagine if Zack becomes a zombie. He'll eat 10 people in just a minute.
I swear zach is the sweetest and cutest person alive😂
Search 'affan ghori most popular game' plz i need the support 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I'm here eating a cheese sandwich well he's eating like king 😕
Bruh he must work out hella.  Portion sizes are insane!
When your wife says its your turn to cook:
I hope he reads our comments to see that as much as we love he's videos we don't like him putting so much food in his mouth makes me want to vomit
Hi Zach. I love pasta, I make tagliatelle with my own hands and I spread the pastry with the rolling pin, while my mother cooks the sauce
The first bite is never ours :(
Are you a proffesional chef zach?🤔
This makes me so  Hungry 😵😵
Bro i never tasted lasagna but it look so good
That garlic part is sooooo satisfying!
Il procedimento della lasagna ha qualche errore, ma la sfoglia è tirata benissimo bella secca e ruvida, 👏
hey kamu kok makan gk gendut gendut
I bet this takes so much effort ...more effort than a whole movie. Asmr should be a genre for the oscard
he should open his own restaurant.
Woow
Amazing
Late night starving, anyone else?
Zach can I have some
Lasanga:ooh i fall apart
Ficaria melhor se a música de fundo fosse do raça negra
Imagine eating this with camera on in your online class
nyum
No one talking about the first bite?..no one?..ight
And YouTube is free 😌
I honest to god like her better then martha stewart
KARALHO OW VAI SE FUDER A ALGUNS MESES ESSE CARA TAVA COM MENOS DE 100MIL INSCRITOS HOJE ELE TEM QUASE 12 MILHÕES KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK

11:51 Zach's stomach was thanking him for making such good food
Make a restaurant. That would be cool.
Welp this made me hungry like always 😭😞😫
His cooking skills are better than mine 🚮
As a side note why TF is your face so creepy in the thumbnail
Where is besciamella??? That isn’t the real Lasagna
Who else remembers zachs old videos 😔😔
سؤال من اي دولة زاك؟
I only mainly wash his videos because the cooking is so satisfying and I love them in general
😱 I've got to cook and devour some pasta this week!☺️💕
Omg I'm so hungry right now
you should do 2x spicy ramen noodle lasagna
😋😍🤩❤❤😨😚دةسخوش
I wish you made the traditional lasagna using bechamel instead of mozzarella and ricotta Dx
it nice to have a mukbanger who doesnt have  a orgasm or have a mental breakdown while eating
the beginning is like a scene from a Disney movie.
The moment you realise that cooking took half of the video -,-
Me takes the biggest bite oooo noice
Why why am i watching this

How does he eat all of that food
He just made a lasagna from scratch and ate it. LEGEND
Question: why does all your cookings look so tasty
what is the song at 2:53 ?
Zach why does ur jabd always shake
I love how he doesn't let his family eat with him
And i thought I shoveled food into my mouth! 😂😭😭
Zach Choi is not even a mukbanger he’s a chef
I don’t get how muckbangers do this:( I can’t even eat a quarter of that thing
It makes me hungry
Can we date so I can eat your leftovers? 😁❤️
Garfield would love eating this
Ебать там форточка
Starts at 7:46
Garfield would kill just to find this.
Oink oink Charli .
Daaaang I am craving for this
Una lasagna e sotto c'è la musica napoletana 😅
Ngl the food looks good, but the "mukbang" part ruins the entire video  It's so disqusting
Italy loves you🇮🇹🇮🇹
Should he be banned for making us hungry
This is way better than nikado avocado or smth
Wowww
I swear if that lasagna falls over
Don't choke
He should've drank the wine WITH the pizza❗😑

Sacolééé
I no he was sick after this this is the definition of gluttony
How are you not fat!?
Why do you take so little bites while eating that massive lasagna
I think he’s scared the food is gonna run away 😭
The music makes me feel sad
This basically a 11 minutes cooking video and a 7 minutes Mukbang
His presentation is really good. It looks like a  film from a high class cooking film.
Muito bom seus vídeos 👏👏
Wonder why peoplr ain't singin that pewdiepie's song about this food's name with a mocking curse "b*tch"
House tour?
Yum yum yum
This is better than niko
So THIS is how ya make lasagna- I’ve always wondered..-
Men why you all subcribing it just a man eating some food

Zero skills in kitchen..omfg..
He eats like he have been on a diet for 3 months
Boy knows how to cook

Beautiful Audemars piguet
Am I the only one who gets anxiety when Zach doesn't finish his food?
5:20 I can actually feel my eyes burning
Eu só fico indignada de como ele come tanto assim e não engorda só pode ser genética mesmo slc eu respiro perto de um hambúrguer e já engordo 1 kg😹😹😹😹
Does anyone know the songs that are in the video ? Especially the 2nd and the 4th one.
Zach Choi died
music ? 😢 9:40
Lol I know editing takes forever ..keep it up!!
He needs a lot of soda to finish this
I wander if Garfield the cat is watching this
This was an Amazing video and I’m hungry now lol
Imma Drooling right now🤤
Towards the end he moved in slow motion.. 😂😂😭
I can't even tell this is editing or a normal cooking show
5:34 You forgot to cut the garlic with a razor blade
this is absolutely primo stuff, the music with that quiet background its so relaxing and satisfying! Cooking Shows eat ur heart out
Why are you rarely mukbang now?
왜 지금은 먹방이 드물어요?
Wow i like this,,,
OK lasagaaa
zach just grinning away at our starvation 😥🍽
Teacher: ok class, snack time Me: takes out lasagna Teacher: do you have enough to share? Me:
Why the need for such massive bites?
Who was here after watching Marshmallow,benny and zach eating the smores😮
THAT FOOD BUSSIN
Damn he went from buying at the fast food store to cooking his own dishes
I would do questionable things if it meant i could eat this
i bit my phone and now its all cracked lol
15:06 video cut I think u went to throw up cause its hard to consume that much food at once
اكيد انا العربي الوحيد😔😔
How is he not fat 😄
Mom: You can’t make money by eating  Zach Choi: hold my sprite
I would prefer the older videos
Okay but like, being pregnant and watching this just made me start craving lasagna 😂
10:20 is why u guys came for thank me later
I wonder if gordan ramsey would like it
This is better than "Tasty"-
I love how everything is fresh and homeade,I just buy canned pasta sauce lmao
First bite is all yours   Me:wow air so Delecious

He looks as pale as the cheese on his food
Hi
Before the video:  Flour dealer: here’s your cocaine supply got the money? Zack Chan: ye   And that’s how it made pasta :D
Suggestion- Does some random fricking thing with Dave’s Insanity Sauce  (Spicy as hell man)
I think he has a small miniture mic in his mouth
I have to stop watching asmr in the middle of the night-
TIP : NEVER WATCH THIS ON A EMPTY STOMACH  🥺
Zach buddy man pal i need an upload soon please 😁👍
😎👌👍
lol
Eating as a job, Literally the best job ever
*Me eating lasagna with him*
You ever look at someone cooking and you like damn them calories...    That's me when Zach poured that olive oil💀

Zach: first bite is all yours! My screen: no not again- Me: *slowly licks*
Aç şu ağzını iyice ye doğru düzgün. Löp diye kapatıyon ağzını yarısı yerde yemeğin
Zach looks old with this camera
مو في عرب بس أجنبي وينك ياعرب
Zach: First bite is all yours! Me: Bro like 1 million people eat their phones how am I supposed to get a first bite when the first bite has already been eaten?
bro that's not how you eat lasagna
How does he eat so much but keep himself so handsome
You should team up with senator Kasich

U should do videos where u talk in ur vids I miss them I know the reason why you don't talk anymore but ur voice sounds so cute so please Zach do it for ur fans😭😭❤👍
This is way better on how to make something than what nikacado would've done
I feel tingly  I like this feeling of enhanced audio
i would’ve forced myself to finish the rest because i feel bad for leaving food unless i don’t like it
Teacher: no eating in class  That one kid in the back:
👑😎  𝓁𝐨שｅ.  ♛♢

So aesthetically pleasing! 🤩
How video are so relaxing and artistic while cooking and then he becomes the average mukbanger. I would prefer smaller bites.
Why is people disliking his videos?
It been a year since I last watch this channel you have grown alot nice bro

*Zach will never like a comment unless it’s perfect*
Eating start 10:36

This is how my dog see me when I'm eating in front of him
The first bite he took was my lunch of lasagna
Zack:first bite is your Me:my iPad tastes nice

I love on how you present your food! Looks awesome!
LASAGNA IS MY FAVORITE FOOD IT HAS BEEN SINCE THE FIRST TIME I ATE IT
10:33 is when he starts to eat if u wanna know
He's such a fatty
I'm here from songbyrd asmr. I had to unsubscribe. When I first watched your videos i didn't like them. They weren't as good as hers, but i came back and watched again and realized yours are really good. I only watch 1 asmrtist at a time, so hopefully I can love all of your videos.
Anucha
POV: You are hungry
MacDonald s
Idc if u can't talk I need a personal Chef jk lol
ASMR  = a specific gentle stimulus
Who else is enjoying,?
And i have the audacity to say i can cook 🤭
Me: I’m Hungry   My Grandma:

You should put the sound tracks you use, love them
I’d love to see Gordon Ramsay vs Zach Choi
Eating starts at 10:31😁
Hi Zach I haven't watched you in a while good job on 10M subs and I hope you a great day ❤️✌️

Está aqui o comentário que você procura 😊

Music disturbs
He's like he can't eat it anymore but keep pushing
I would love to pay u 1000000 dollars to eat
Your fanz from indonesia 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩say hello Please
Свиньи :-)))

🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
When will we get a voice reveal?
If only we could have that first bite
I'm gonna eat my finger
Mastiga sem fazer som,paresse q ta comendo bosta
I'm happy that you've gotten successful from this but I would be careful about how much you eat in the future, Mukbang's are cool to try every once in a while, but if it becomes everything that your chanel is you risk getting really fat, nikocado avocado is the best example, I just don't want you to risk your health to please people on the internet.
thank you for taking the time ot of your day to eat in my face-
But was it bussin tho😩😩😩
Clave la música del minecraft de fondo
Your like k-pop BTS junkook 😍
Please test lranian food ❤❤❤❤❤👍👍👍👍👍👍🇮🇷🇮🇷
He uses 10 gloves in a video 😅
I really hate to admit it but the preparation was perfect. From the sheet to the sauce you did all the steps correctly with the right ingredients. Again, I hate to admit it but you did an excellent job. Bravo.
Alguien de México o puro hshecdkvsoa
I like how he makes it himself
Hes so full he wants to cry

*Omg his filming style 💯*

This man is a legend in my eyes I love his videos & the homemade lasagna ugh to die for
i remember when he used to be able to finish a meal.
en el minuto 10:3 tiene cara de culo
This man did not just have a bite of a slice of lasagna. He had a whole damn slice of lasagna in a bite.
Ngl looks kinda good
Not only is this ASMR but it’s a cooking show.
This is a cooking show. I wanna get a bite in that. 2129, YES, THE DAY HAS FINALLY COME. Noms on lasagna. :D

Him: first bite is all yours Me: takes a bite out of my phone *hehe......Crunchyyy... 😀
I just found out this man was adopted. And based off of a google research I just did, he doesn't talk much since he has no personal info to actually say, never knew that but I'm glad he's doing okay
Melhor canal do mundo de ASMR
I found it strange that only the video listened to the voice of him eating but many watched
Try Indian spicy food
Effing AMAZING, Need a man who knows how to cook like Zach..Let's cook together! 😍🤤💕
Your so good at what you do❤️
Me: *watching him eat good looking things while eating a donut* 👁💧👄💧👁
U should do a video were you talk and not just whisper
he is the best asmr of all, he eats well never spoils anything, his scenery is very organized, and he also doesn’t eat disgusting things like live animals etc, just normal foods that everyone eats 😺
Am I the only one that pretended to take the first bite?
10:46 he is trying to be cute but he is cute
I have been touching by this video ! Zach Choi you are truly my favourite Mukbanger ! 💪
Ok by now hes just inhaling the lasagna
When are we going to discuss his cholesterol?
New sub!
Thank you Zach for making my favorite food <3
Why does Zach look like my cousin?🤔
This reminds me of Garfield..Lasagna!!!

The perfect
Woow
Taka taka takata
Zack : first you eat  Me:🕶 don't tease me Zack : now my turn  Me:👨‍💻ate phone  Ps it was good
Not a fan of these long videos. Not really getting the point of evolving the channel into a aesthetic cooking channel when he was built on people coming to watch him eat. However I guess people evolve and so too does his followers, and I shall respect that. Cheers
Zach choi is the type of guy to make you love the food you hate
did you invited garfield?
The ONLY mukbanger of the three(y'all know the other 2) that preps, makes, & cook his food.  PS: of all the American Mukbangers, i bet Zach would be the ONLY ONE that Gordon Ramsy himself approves of lol.
Zach choi ASMR went from an eating mukbang channel to cooking tutorials
Hah henem
Hey can you still make this without onions?
Acaso soy el único que habla español?!  :(
Give me pls 🤤🤤
3:15 That be lookin like Chips for me 👁👄👁
Asmr is the best
Try eating bi*c"h lasagna
Wow
You should do mrbeast burger for the next video

Why do only talk if your cap is backwards?

Mano eu to realmente apaixonada por ele gente lindo d maissss
Choi
You can tell zach was very happy to finally get to eat it 😂😂🥰
who watching this video at 3 am
Hey Zach I now you'll likely never see this comment but when cutting onions dont start by cutting off the root, leave it intact as you dice. if you cut if off first, the onion will bleed more and it will makes your eyes tear up way more.
Cute
I recomand for you sarmale
Did anyone else notice he didn’t make himself a G-fuel drink. Did they stop sponsoring him?
Kon kon india se ho isi logo ko mein gali dene aya hoon wo logo ne samaj nehin payenge 😜😀😁
Go back to fast food like McDonalds and Pizza Hut and Popeyes and stuff like that

Fun Fact: he is the best mukbanger ever lived
Bro imagine being evicted from.your house and you go on your moms phone and see this guy just stuffing his face
That's one big mouth
At this point he should make another channel showcasing how he keeps such amazing physique despite absorbing so many calories. I would love to have an endless gullet but also love staying healthy lol
An excellent video!🤗🇮🇹
kapan upload nya
I love that you went from nicely presenting fast food to beautifully presenting how you make the make food
Kd os br?
Bro usa sonidos falsos que mal 😭😭
do you like it? yes! It was amazing, I do it too, but it was the first time I roared like this.
I JUST SAW HIS TIKTOK IN MY FYP-
Gordon Ramsay has been very quiet lately
I’m surprised he is not fat
The only thing missing here is the smell of the food he is making !! 🤣
Who remember when his background used to be yellow in his first vid
Please go live 🙏🙏🙏
Me:no one can smile while eating  Zach:well can u hold my sprite pls?:)

Someone leaked your collab video with Benny Blonco, and Marshmallow
Who taught you to cook ?
sometimes i question why i like to watch people eat
He is the only mukbanger I know that actually shows how to cook what he eats from scratch!
That's a beautiful lasagna! I really enjoyed watching the whole process of you making from scratch!
Как называется мелодия??
Zach doesn't need the food, the food needs him 🤤😍

high quality video and really nice but as an Italian I say that the recipe is completely wrong
J’ai faim maintenant 😭🤚
Turklerrrr neredesiniz
I’m so jealous, I knew I shouldn’t have clicked on this video. Lasagna is my favourite food, and this just makes me want to try it with the seasoning, I wish you could invite me to your house so we can feast ;-; Honestly a dreammmm
A cooking tutorial and eating a lot?! Holy lord this channel is great!
As Italian I approve this video
Not gonna lie i kinda want his recipe it just looks so good

Wow dia punya tiktok loh wkwk
i watch his videos when i need to sleep because when he cooks it’s very relaxing
/english/ and you call me lasagna, lasagna is made with béchamel, fresh tomato sauce and parmesan ... not with ricotta and farie crap ... it's the umpteenth time that you insult Italian cuisine ... I'm fed up. you don't know how to do such a simple thing /Italian/ e tu quella me la chiami lasagna , la lasagna va fatta con la besciamella , il pomodoro fresco il ragù e parmigiano ...non con ricotta e schifezze farie ...è lennesima volta che insultate la cucina italiana ...sono stufo .Se non sapete fare una cosa cosi semplice informatevi
Kids: no eating in the back  Teacher in class:                 *HOL'UP*
9:15 it looks like that thing that you clean your glasses with or it's just me?
Hello i from Indonesia 🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩🇮🇩
เฮ้ยมึงเป็นใบ้หรอ
i don’t get why sometimes people hate on him or nik,they are just trying to have fun and it makes me happy because sometimes i don’t wanna eat that day and then i see both of them on my notifications and then i go make food and eat with them and that’s just makes my day when i do and they always say “first bite is yours” and i just smile and take a bite of my food! okay byeee! that’s all i wanted to say :)
So this is what my dog sees when I eat in front of him
I wish i had someone to look at me as zach looks at his food.....
If i eat the first bite than nothing will be left
10:25 thank me later: )
최고예요 你最棒 GOOD🙆🏼‍♀️🙆🏼‍♀️🙆🏼‍♀️🙆🏼‍♀️🙆🏼‍♀️🙆🏼‍♀️🙆🏼‍♀️🙆🏼‍♀️

Zach works so damn much just to eat. No wonder he's lean and fine.
I wish I could go to his house and eat every thing
Меня поражает то что он до сих пор не жирный блять я если съем одну крошку хлеба то на 1000000000 прибавлю в весе сука

Dude just talk in ur videos whats the point doing videos if u dont talk
Honestly. If you don't like Zach Choi, there's something wrong with you

Garfield is now trying to find his ip adress
How dose he eat all that and stay skinny and I gain 10 pounds from a McDonald’s burger???
Alv, y yo con hambre
I like watching this guy and no offense but when I watch any mukbang I get so sick
Can we PLEEEEAAAAASSSSSSEEEEE get a voice without whispering reveal
I came back here after what? 1 year and i’m glad to see he improved his video quality by a LOT, also glad to see he didn’t post videos that frequently to balance his diet. His past vids are already satisfying to watch, now it’s even more. Wish you luck and more sucessful on the future bro!
Lasanha mano, eu queria muito estar no lugar dele agora kskks ;-;
You should do a voice reveal
Face reveal naman lods wag puro pwet ipakita sa cam nakakahiya sa pagkain e
Big boy lasa
you can't see it in his face but I think he's very happy every time eats it all :>
the only reason why I don't watch this guy anymore is because he only makes 4k asmr
5:01 ..... Thankyou. <33
Can we all appreciate that he went into the next clip as soo as the oil was perfect, 5:01
I havent eaten anything all day and this makes me feel better🙃
10:25 it's the biggest lasagna I've seen

For all the newbies, this is Zach, most of us have been with him for a while now, and we’ve always enjoyed his videos. And just so you know, the magic floating camera that captures his intros, is his girlfriend lol, feel bad for all you ladies watching
Ele fez o garfo também, da sua própria árvore.  😂😂😂 E...comeu o meu primeiro pedaço. 😡😄😂😂😂 Obrigada pela receita, Zach. 😉👍😙

Zach choi Você pode cozinhar melhor
after 2 fucking years he looks only a tinsy bit fatter... Jesus christ this man must keep sports very very close to his heart, unlike nicocado avocado
I love the noises behind the vegitable
Zach has so much passion for food 😍 respect bro
Once a month now?
Man you're so handsome 🤩
I feel so happy that zach's back
aceu
Can't believe watching someone else eat is soooo entertaining! 🤤🤤🤤🤤
That stuff juicy bro
How do you stay slim!? 🥺
Zach every outro:🙂✊ 🙂👍 🙂✊ 😗✌
I wish I could really have the first bite
Saale karxul bhi khaale  Daloddar
you are really expert in cooking
Watching this at 2 am in the morning hungry .~.
There's just. SO. MUCH.
Zach Choi ASMR 11.2 million subs
OMG he's back
The cinematography of every ingredient is so immaculate 😍
I like more the part of cooking than eating
I bet the 2.6k thumbs down are mad bc they can't make lasagna
Disgusting and excessive fucking noises
I wouldn't be surprised if this guy was a professional chef at a professional ass restaurant
Zack: first bite is all yours Me: tries to take a bite from the tablet but the pause button get in  the way *why are we still here, just to suffer*
Sensual food visuals. Relaxing.
my boy is the ASMR legend man the quality of the sound and the presentation is just MAGNIFICENT!!!
When he was eating food he look like he laughed
I love Italian food n you happy new year bub
This guys smile is so contagious bro. Seeing him smile makes me smile too.
2021:people watching zach  choi starving   2069:some technology exists that let u eat through the screen
God he really has the best editing skills I’ve ever seen
Why I’m I even watching this while hungry 🤤 it looks so good though if only it wasn’t midnight
Dang zach prob on the toilet for another month
Mommy: y u take screen bite Me: it because he tell firs bite mine!!1,!!! So funny right guys 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How does he eat so much but not get fat?
Gardfield:I Want Some Lasagna  Gardfielf:I want some lasaga
Eso se ve rico c:
You’re a good chef
This is what is called premium content. Like, wow, way better than any cooking shows out there. Incredibly talented and dedicated.
Me who just realized I can watch in 2160p😐
YALL how does this guy somehow smiles without actually smiling 😭
This isn’t asmr tbh I enjoyed his old videos more.that was asmr this has a lot of loud sounds And background music. His new videos. Are more about cooking the food rather than the sounds
Try the italian lasagna ✌😎
I just had boba and am kinda overwhelmed with sweetness so i clicked very fast because this looks absolutely heavenly lol
Please eat Korean food!^^
Garfield would be proud
Top😍💅
You should do mr beast burger!
Imagine being his wife one day. What is he doing for living? Eating in front of camera. Wtf? So embarassing, I'm glad I was born in 90s.
Am I the only one that doesn't like lasagna? 💀🤣
Could you make a video of eating Kimchi with rice?
I really wonder all these great videos he’s making takes so long to film every shot as possible so can we all thank this man for all his hard work just to satisfy us :)
I know in one of your old vids you were talking
No offence but I really don’t like how much of a messy eater he is, I saw a video of him eating a McDonalds burger and he took about 4 fast bites out of it chewing his guts out. Oh men 😂
Zach Choi: uses a big fat grill  Me be like: Mom how do I turn on the microwave!?
الله احتركنة علي
يلوچ بن الركعه و ابن الطنطل
i still dont get how he stays so lean while eating so much food 😭
الله لا الله لا يوفقك
Are we just gonna ignore how unproblematic Zach is?
Kkkkkkkkk
U should be a chef-
لازانيااااا
The added music made me sad.
Is there any way you can make lasagne without wine?
Imagine being his roommate  🤤🤤🤤
Very tasty
10 million seskraibe 🥰🥰😇👌👍👍👍
Props to this guy for filming him making it too
*hi*
im soo obssesed with your videos, im sure you could be a chef one day
Für die deutsche : zach choi amena choi
Mukbangers who can eat huge amount of foods....  Me after few bites: aight im full
*Pewdiepie seen*
Bruhhh i can only afford to watch this kind of people eat my fave foods coz i dont have a talent to cook and ingredients to make one hahaha
I fell asleep while watching this
이분 한국 분 이신가요???
Am I the only one seeing his hand shaking a lot
I just hope there's a restaurant where the menu contains all the food he made in this channel. Dang Zach you never disappoint ♥️
Amazing stuff!
He should really start his own cooking channel
Ууу у меня настроение класс   В одних кросах что лето что марозы
Hey Zach you inspire me so much to upload mukbang and asmr
หล่อนกินเยอะขนาดนี้ยังไม่อ้วนอีกหรอคะะ
Eating asmr? More like cooking asmr
I get those goosebumps everytime
I hope to love your food
Do I I'm the only person who think this channel is torture.!.!
The cooking process is more dramatic than my life.
not me watching this during class starving cuz i havent got my breakfast and now im even hungrier than before.
zach be chilling
just seeing nickarado est unhealthy then looking at zach choi is nice
I think he has the greatest cinematic setup
before he used to upload like every 2 days   now its 1 video per week
Don't lie to me, you skip the part when he was cooking the food on every video just to watch the part that he is eating
What am surprise the most he almost eat all.. :OOOOOOOOOOOO
hire me ☺️
how does Zach make his intros look like ads im like where is the skip button
Always been a fan but something has definitely changed in his videos... of course the obvious, but there is something else and I’m not sure what it is ...
this lasagna is HUGE
man the first time I watch these ASMR video I thought they put their microphone in their mouth
All the koreans viewer: A new recipe without any chemical
I hope Zach works out everyday to compensate for the huge portions he eats
Only the OGs will remember the sprite...
Let's see how many subs I can get from this comment current 0
okay but he looks so happy
The recipe is still no match for the good ol' grandma cooking.
What I like about this guy is he makes all his food homemade as to other youtubers they will just buy the thing instead of making it from scratch in my opinion
Am I the only one thinking he’s better then Gordon Ramsey at cooking
I think he lives in a big kitchen a gym attached with it and he just comes to eat and back to gym
This is a fancy version of lasagne
Tengo hambre lñm
That satisfaction on the face after the first bite
🎉Viva México 🎉🇲🇽
Nice watch! ; )
I like your food in your Stacy really fun but can you can you met me before I live in Detroit if you can I do some rapping I really like my face

I feel a connection when he looks Direct me I feel in love!!!!! 😍😍😍
We Gotta Eat Together Someday!
This reminds me of garfield
hey Zach what will you do to the food if you did not finish it.
He needs to make a restuarant 😌👀❤❤
As a person that gains weight just by breathing If I ate this, I'd be as fat as nickocado avocado the very exact next day, which sucks.
Zach motivates us to learn how to cook. But in a good way....
Damm he made his noodle  from scratch
It’s been so long I have watched you. Glad to see you doing good!
Sooooo good
Why is the music so- so- SAPPY?!?!? 🥺
Who else would love to be at  his house and hear him say “Dinners ready”
The best💚💛
* *Italian stereotypes intensifies* *
يخرب بيتك عهلتم عدد العرب
after watching this at night, I look at my fridge and go back to my bed after looking at the yogurt in the bowl..
My all-time fav dish. I would pay hundreds of dollars to eat HIS lasagna...
As an italian, that lasagna looks very good 👍🏻👌🏻😋
You are getting rich week by week congratulations hope me too will succeed one day.
لو انت عربي حط لايك عشان أحس أن مش العربيه الوحيد البتتفرج
I'm kinda hungry now.. I wonder why🤔
I stay here wanting to reach the summit
He forces the eating so hard so it makes it crunchy 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Me: did you finish the food? Zach: yes       Me: at what cost?   Zach: the toilet 🚽
I very much appreciate that he left out the meat grinding part, that would have grossed me out a bit
people who want back old zack like
Ay ben düşüyorum bu çekimlere
When he said first bite all yours I was like I'm trying to save my bite but he ate it 😭😭  Lol😅😅👊
Dislike no!
My daughter in the back round saying " You can peel an tomato" 😂🤣😂🤣🤭
Who else remembers when he eat fast food and insta noodle everyday
This Mans stomach is soo tortured
I dont know why I got hyped when the cooking wine poped open
Me after 1 chip : 🤰

The presentation makes me feel like eating lasagna in a forest😁
ele coloca a lasanha na boca como se tivesse fazendo garganta profunda cara
Saya Suka Anda Membuat Video Seperti Dulu:)

By the way your lasagna looks so amazing and good and delicious
Hey, can I give you a typical recipe for a Chilean meal? It will make me proud
God he about choked himself on that first bite

He TEASES US BY SAYING FIRST BIT IS ALL YOURS. HOW CAN YOU DO THAT ZACH.
"Dying of Hunger" -Nicki M
Zach Choi is extremely overrated (only the smart people will know what I’m talking about)
한국인 혼혈이신가요?Are you of mixed Korean descent?
Zach forgot to do the Sprite thing
CAN I PLEASE PLACE A 2 PAN ORDER !!!!!🤣😅😋🤗💞💯💣
Giveaway food hehe
All the food he makes looks so good IGH
Time is running short. Believe and confess to Jesus and stop putting him aside before it is too late. Jesus is the only way to heaven. Not by works or by going to Church every Sunday (not saying stop attending) John 14:6 “Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” Romans 10:9-10 “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved.” Spread the word God bless :)
Name one other mukbanger with skills like Zach’s, go on, I dare you.
Is you mi frinds in house 🤩😍
I don’t get how he does those camera Angles do perfectly🤩
everyone: enjoys the eating sounds me: is starving and wants to snatch the food out of the screen

Is it just me or does he make you wanna eat food you don’t like 😂x
*forest lasagna*

Lasagna is my favorite pro dish

You make me hungry

Who wants to eat with Zach? I want to eat this too.. i want to try this , looks so yummy 🤩
E questa sarebbe una lasagna ?
Is this the fabled Wembley lasagne
I will be in heaven if i could have this lasagna for my own *.*
This was the most cinematic thing I've ever seen. So beautiful wtf.
*O MELHOR VÍDEO DO ANO* 👏😍
Minecraft brewing stand sounds : 6:15
Imagine if garfield was in this video...
Not fun fact he eat more food than the kids in  Afrika
I was wondering why some recipe's call for extra yolk so I looked it up. Apparently with pasta specifically, it prevents separation of ingredients when boiling the pasta, and it also prevents white spots from the wheat flour. It's for binding, extra fats, flavor, and stability. Love your thing Zach. Best AMSR online.
Who else wishes that Zach Choi was cousin Zach. Thanksgivings will be my favorite.
I am Italian e this is good lasagna bro first
BELO CANAL !!
Garfield enters the chat 🤤

I was on my way to the screen but then he took it away and ate it 😔
Am i the only one that wants to try zach's food??
You’re so fun to watch! 😍
Invítame a comer contigo 🥺✨🧡
Any mukbang recommendations? Zach Choi! How about cooking? Zach Choi!! What about ASMR? Zach Choi!!!!
All of his video is lying.....the amount of your foods is impossible for human to eat...and when you chewing ur food then you will skip it ...why? so that you can vomit your foods?  Come on  editor....edit your video neatly😒
I SAW THAT TIKTOK ZACH
Wow! Last time I saw you, you had 4M subs and that was just a few months back! Great job! Love your cooking & eating content 😋

Let me guess, was ur mouth watering when u saw that food?🤣
😋
This vibe is like im watching a movie
Can't believe I'm being entertained just by a guy eating lasagna.
THE FACT THAT I ALWAYS SKIPP THR COOKING UNTIL NOW AND REALISING THR MASTERPIECE I KEEP ON MISSING OHT FUCK
the cooking part is the best part.
Vontade de comer um cuzin com farofa
You can obviously tell he went to Culinary school the way he cut with his knife and has a perfect pinch on the spine of the knife and also he doing a low cut because the tip of the knife still on the borde
Omg that look so good I just want to eat that🤤
I see meat x999 in every vid. Watch out for your kidneys!
Hi
Even your editing is very artistic! I am learning a lot. Continued success.
getting my wisdom teeth taken out in 12 hours, gotta look at food while i still can
Imagine that Gordon Ramsay might comment his youtube and will say "i'd like to collab with you Zachoi"  Edit: wow 25 likes thank u guys i have never reached 25 likes before
some mukbangers are just okay and simple but when we go to Zachoi we find that he made it to the next level 😂😂
garfield was found cowering in his cat bed, wigless and hungry.
Brasil?
I’m gone for a year and I come back and Zach’s channel is like a cooking show
I felt like Zach has a lot of sprite in his fridge
A conditioning machine, LoreChirik Also have that
He posts less and I don’t know why..
Look at your mouth and the sound, hmmmm so delicious! you are so influencing.
Choi is not as elegant as he once was. He was delicate....the sounds. Now just pure gluttonous. He's disgusting
I have to eat it warm not cold.
You have a great voice I dont get why your insecure about it
Allò, per la pasta ci siamo bravo, però il sugo fio mio Sedano,carota e cipolla a soffriggere, aggiungi carne e rosoli, quando è rosolata sfumi con il vino rosso e poi aggiungi il pomodoro!!! ( cuoci per minimo 2 ore e mezza) Per il resto bravo, ma impara a fare un buon ragù😛
☺️ I hop he has a great day like me 😇😌😋
Love this vid, Zach!
Lmao now I want lasagna even tho I don’t like lasagna
Adopt me- THE FOOD
Wow I tip my hate to you. I dont know how you do but WOW. I'm sooo jealous
how is zach still so skinny
Dam Zach!😁👌

Im wondering what his grocery bills must be like?
you make me drool ......
Looks delicous
That first bite though 👌 I want some so bad 😭
Starts eating at 10:22 you welcome;)
Roses are red Violets are blue The eating starts at 10:22 (I still prefer to watch the cooking though)
I love how he always do the recipe for us
This man just needs eat to get girls-
welp i don't know why I'm watching this before  I eat in 2 hours :/
Is it possible that his AMAZING camera is better than the human eye?  Iysm Zach!
LEGEND ASMR🤩
my sister was watching this with mee and before you started to eat the food her mouth started to water these were her words and i quote(Jesus say to share)
Esses povo japonês comem tanto e não fica gordo agora eu como pouco e tô gorda e nem assim tanto gordura e nem tanta comida,agora esse homem não enche o cú nn é kkkkkk
The amount of effort he puts into these videos is amazing, they are always so soothing and relaxing 😌
estaba esperando esa presentación epiC😈👌🏻
Wowww farklı 👍
That looks fantastic, however, the way your stuffing it in looks gross. I know this is an ASMR channel but listening and watching this made me sick to my stomach. What you ate in that first bite was a serving for me. I can’t watch your stuff your face. It’s not necessary.
The smile on his face on the first bite tho
Ahh i love to see my guy with the cheeky smile when He hits the first bite
Only came here to learn how to make it
Why does the food look edited in???
Pleaseeee eat a charcuterie board
He went all pro with his gear then he pulls this out
This guy nearly ate a whole pan of lasagna by himself. I could never.
Me sitting here hungry even though i have food but don't wanna get up 😭😭
Nice watch

Very nice 👍🌹👌
Wow delicious 😋😋😋
Eso sería la comida de un año en latinoamérica :c
When he was pouring in the water I felt some hit me 😳
Does anyone come here for the food not the sounds
everyone here should take a look at youtube channel  @joeybtoonz
Wtf he didn't finish it😝
Tbh I dont like his asmr, but quality is on high level. Instead, I like how he cooks his food
Quality Content ❤️
My part-Italian soul really misses the soffritto and bechamel sauce, but otherwise looks great! :)

Who else didn’t skip the cooking
Oh no garfiel
What it sounds like when you eat while you’re sick:
Damn! That look good
fatfatfatfat
His intros keep getting better
Wih udah 11 JT aku dari 2 JT dulu

Why he didn't get fat
I remember when Zach used to upload almost daily😔

I swear that zach is  a undercover pro cook bc like dam....
Do you like fried rice if you like making fried rice  Im from Indonesian
Ok i know zach is proffesional and hes a top mukbanger but hes breathing noises im not saying that he should not breath but maybe like avoid breathing loudly cause it rly irritates the asmr noises my opinion btw
So silent 😶 like a ninja
you look so happy hahaha
Whi isn't anyone going to talk about why he is shaking???
My friend : hey dude wht are  you doing?  ME: seeing an random Asian dude eating the whole lasagna.
This is art.
He doesn’t need Gordan Ramsay, Gordon needs HIM
Wounder if he got a low metabolism
👎
Уххх, мой живоооот
My dream birthday: Have Zach cook me up one of his bomb lasagnas! 🍷🍝🍷
y no comes mamás gordas?
Seeing in thumbnail there was so much light and in video it's so dark  That's called extra editing
Garfield: 👁👄👁
I love how Zach shows the cooking process unlike most mukbangers!
🤤🤤🤤
Zach - "first bite is all yours"  And I took that personally
aesthetic version of gordon ramsey
You owe us 1000 triggers
You really do a very good job binging your audience through an amazing experience!
7:45 look at that sweet meat
He fuckin that shii up😭
This video so good. The colour so beautiful and even better than some video cooking
My favourite food!!!!
Zach choi uploads a video Video quality :2160p4k     My laptop maximum 360p take it or leave it
I've already eaten dinner but bish this video has just made me hungry for lasagna.
He's stomach:🤰      Our stomach watching this:😢☠️🤤🖕👅😖
Can u do a African American soul food mukbang?
AMAZING💖💖💖💖💖💖
I don’t like lasagna I hate it. But you’re really making me wanna shove that down my esophagus
I require lasagna,Zach
Cooking and farting* sounds
POV your in your room and find this video and now your hungry
This just wants me to have this rn 😤
This video made me hungry lol
I can’t even imagine how long it took to make this video. Absolutely amazing. We appreciate you Zach 🙌🏼
Is he still with that girlfriend of his!!?? She's extremely lucky! This man does it all
Ladies and gentlemen I present the real Gordon Ramsey
Que rico
Jangan bikin video mukbang pas puasa

Бред какой-то
10:21 :)
In the beginning I said in my head “no way he is going to make the pasta sheets from scratch”😶....he is a CHEF 👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️ he then goes on to mince his own steak 😶❤️
He is going to get fat
Im so impressed with the intro!!👏👏👏 Zach keeps upgrading his camera skills and editing im so proud of him, and woa that lasagna from scratch looks sooo good bet it tasted better than the pic❤️❤️❤️
🥰
You should try fasting for like a week and then make a huge meal
why is it that im a person that hates eating sounds but i can watch asmr? anyone else
Did he train himself to eat LARGE amounts of food without hurting himself?? Does he starve himself?? This is amazing
STOP MAKING CHEESE LOOK GOOD I HATE CHEESE, BUT FOR SOME ODD REASON I WANT ALL THE CHEESE😭
When I only heard two gulps from drinking... I was very disappointed 😭
Really LOL 😂😂😂😂🤦🏿‍♀️
3/4th of the video is just how to make it 😂😂😂 but it looks good ✌️
5:14 PUI PUI モルカー
Fun fact: you wanna marry zach and divorce to get half of his food
Que milagre não começou com uma lata de Sprite kkk
1m de viws e 91 mil likes Enfim a hipocrisia
Sprite should sponsor this man
Looks like a cooking show
Solo voy a decir que me parece muy adorable cuando sonrie 🙂
That knife is sharp as heckkk
Zack do you have any food that is Vegetarian for me becuase i am vegetarian
You have one of the best jobs in the world.
you already know his girlfriend be feasting on his meals👍🏽😭

Damn...his lasagna is so succulent....will u marry me😄😄😄
Garfield want to know your location
Voice revel
thank God for a long time never making a viedo of lasgna before
I love and am so impressed he makes everything from scratch. The only thing he can't do is to farm and mill his own wheat lol
Biggest question is where does the weight go i saw that video from Wendy's in 2019 with that double cheese burger XD (like just looking at that lasagna and I gain 12 pounds :\) My favorite part of these videos (besides the food and asmr) is the thumbs up and peace at the end
Now I know how my pets feel when I eat in front of them
I'm hungry 😔
Zach. You look healthier and happier. 🖤
i’m definitely gonna tell her about this video
my 3 year old daughter loves you lol she goes right to your page and search for a video she says you her brother lol 😂
Sometimes i feel like the food he eats is too much for a man like him, but he eats like its nothing for him.
I’ve been here since the beginning and the improvement is astounding! Seriously, check out his first video compared to now... (it was still good don’t get me wrong)
Yess
*Garfield would like to know your location*
I really love your channel
That’s not a lasagna that’s a  Lasasasagna
Me: the bill please Zach: I think we might have to extend the bill to another 30 years

You don't know how freaking loooong I've been waiting for this vid lol
*Garfield has joined the chat*
And again I say...ZACH CHOI IS THE KING OF ASMR SATISFYING🎊🎉👏👏👏👏👏
Looks amazing👄🤤🤤🤤
Hello, i've a question, how can you burn all these calories? I mean, do you go to the gym? Because i see a lot of mukbangers eat A LOT of food 2000+/3000+ calories and idk how to deal with it. Do you eat a single meal in a day or what? Thanks  in advance! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶
Me: dying to know how the food tastes like   Zach: you don't need my words (smiles with his eyes)👼  Me: that explains it all
quick question do you ever put people in your meat grinder?🥰 i'm a big fan too ily
*Italian music intensifies*
That pasta dough getting more action than me
What if u made a 2nd channel for cooking ur food for people who might want to cook what u doing  then just post the eating on ur main channel
*You Smell It* *?*
Garfield would like to know your location
Why do you use gloves
Tu forma de cocinar es así 🧐elegante XD

Talent cooking, after that yummy eating

Ramzi saw a future that I love your cooking and. Your passion for cooking

Soya in that tomatoe sauce was just a blasfemy
Finally i have been waiting for him to make lasagna
The camera quality is better than my eyes

He will never be a loyal boyfriend or husband.  And maybe he is not searching to have 1. Its better that way...
So, whose hungry in bed?
The whole video is so satisfying and interesting!✨
that not a lasagna that a tower of  lasagna 😉
Is Zach Choi the first non-Italian person on youtube that can actually make a true lasagna? Wow
10:35 Jesus

My mouth is watering, my stomach is growling, just saying.
When you tell your mum that you like the lasagna last night:
Русские здесь?

How do you stay skinny from wearing all of this food
The video quality and presentation is Amazing I love the sound of the cooking preparation at the start.
Perfect husband🥺
Or you like eat
Are you fat
HELLO Jack👋
How you're so skinny
The one question that goes through my head whenever I watch these videos is         "Can I have some?"
Good video, but I would hate to do the dishes at your house.
คนไทยรวมกันตรงนี้
he is mukbang king 😎
Pewdiepie : GOOD LASAGNA
Zach choi kırmızı çizgimizdir
سمبوسه
I like his smile more than his food  :)
우왕 맛있겠당. 영상 잘봤어요 :)
Omg how did he eat that much! That’s a hella ton, ngl I would be eating all of it too 😂😂
能看出来有轻度强迫症
Bro was this man a 5-star chef before YouTube
I can feel the smell of the garlic he's chopping here
Waw nicee☺😍
Zach : Eats a very big Lasagna Matt Stonie : Amateur Garfield : AMATEURS
1 month not video!? Где ты был?
Just happy My guy isn't eating trash fast food
Finalmente una lasagna degna di un vero italiano
Zach choi, before n after mukbang
Why u not make an Gaming channel
The way he looks at his lasagna like, dam im really good at this 😂, btw can i have some? 🤤😁
where does zach choi lives north korea or south korea
Welz was here 2021 😂😂
Really would like to know the music at 3:45
Every time I watch this mans videos: yeah that brotha’s starvin
Zach : make my fav food  Me : i have been summoned 👀
I LUV LASAGNA
Bruh:( why:(
1:26 "Stir with fork, incorporating flour from sides of well slowly"    Clearly goes in light speed
I love you zach choi asmr
Mom: you cant get rich if you eat Me: are you sure about that
MUKBANG CRAB BIG
10:35 10:35 10:35 Eat the start
I think he must've forgotten about J-hopes sprite...? 🤨💜
MY FAV LASGNA AND PIZZA
Him: the first bite is your's Me: ok also me: EATS THE PHONE
he doesn’t need the girls, the girls need him.
If I ever did this my broke self would just be like:  “Hey guys today we’re putting cream cheese on bagels!”
If i drink a cup of water ill look like a whale, while he eats so much and nothing happens.
Eyes : Satisfied Ears : Satisfied Stomach : Triggered
Zach *pressing dough* The dough “ I like the way u move your hands “
says the first bite is all yours and he takes it away to his stomach .......damn🤧🤧
very bad lasagna. you should eat the worms and not try to cook Italian
I think that Gordon Ramsay should react to this
I don’t know what Zach is making but I’m guessing it’s lazomia because of the dough
Pak kamu channel nya bagus amat👍👍🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Your gorgeous when you smile
When you actually bring food to eat while watching him.
I personally dislike lasagna.. But this has me changing my mind. Lol .. Amazing job.
What are you going to do with the egg whites?
Warning : watch out for orange cats while making this/eating this
He looks so happy. Feels wholesome.
You really think ur talented lol
Nice very nice
This is what I call a high quality, professional asmr work right here🤩🤩
Hey i know you get alot of comments and probably wont see this but i saw your watch and it looks really nice what type is it
You should put the macros and calories of it on screen before you eat
Who else tried to bite the screen when he put the food close to the camera
Not being rude, but I just love when men knows how to cook.
a collab with jessi? shes a kpop singer. her korean name is ho hyun jo. she's really funny and I would love to see her do asmr
Nice👌
OK ZACK YOU CAN EAT LIKE  A HOLE MEAL THAT CAN FEED A HOLE FAMILY AND KEEP THIN AS A STICK!!!  BUT ME OVER HERE CAN'T EVEN EAT 1 STACK AND I AM SONFAT LIKE HOT DO YOU DO IT    T^T

@ih) No
Act like this comment is funny
*Welcome back to Zach’s cooking lessons!*
let's talk about the quality
this video was sugested by Garfield Gang
I think I know what I want for dinner 😁
My mom is a fan of you and she wants to see you eating sisig and pancit gisado and lechon kawali (Filipino foods)
I’m surprised he didn’t milk his own cow to make the cheese
Why does it feel like he trying be a Italian person who is rich
I'm wondering why you aren't a chef Imagine your school serving this
I want some now :( it's 5 am
Unlike nikocado, Zach is healthy and can cook. 🙂🙂🙂better video and doesn’t do it everyday.
Huuy que rico 🤤😋
Esse é o comentário Brasileiro que você procurava
Æ
Zach we already know u not gonna finish it😂✋
I feel like he should make a cooking channel I would totally watch it
Don't lie, who else is jealous of the food 😂
You wish that was you huh?
Alguém br?
damn this man can cook
I watch this because I don’t get this type of food 😔
So professional 🙌
Pan
I bet he pooped after he ate that
It’s the sleeve for me 🥵🥵🥵
Zach I meant
I remember when Zack made daily uploads
5:34 heaven!
I made it soooooooooo  good one mistake I made was putting my lil sis near it and she dropped like 4 sardines in it while my uncle was trying to put it in a box luckily I got it out no sardine flavour
Damn Zach... that was a huge first bite <3
Me: *sees thumbnail* Also me: yeah he ain't gon finish that😎
does anyone know the song from 3:15 ? its so beautiful
who else notices he never uses a white shirt
This isn’t just asmr mukbang this is art ..
Wie kann man so eine scheiße feiern 10 Minuten Ohren voll schmatzen widerlich
Me when he Said first bite of s yours me bites the screen
Minchia ma si un cati i lippu ca manci cuamu i puairci
I don’t want my fav asmrtist to be fat :( but nice vid it made me starvin
The Italians would be proud. Go Zach😋😋😋
Before Subscriber:1.17M After Subscriber:11.1M Like if ur fans of Zach Choi 👇
حلوه جدا مافي مثلها احبها كثيرا
What's with the deepthroating?
Wow😋
Great video making me feel hungry friend let’s stay contact
I haven’t gotten tingles from an asmr in probably 6 months, and this made it go crazy.
I mean these fancy 4k videos are good but am i the only one whos missing the old upload schedule ?? I know i know quality over quantity but i think in this case quantity was a bit better.
Honestly how do you do a mukbang? Do you just like not eat for the whole day until this big meal and stuff your insides?
I love lasagna 😍🤤💞💞💞
I am so glad that I am having homemade seafood fettuccine for dinner tonight while I watch this 🤤
Wait a second it never crosses my mind of if he is working out 🏋️‍♀️ although he looks pretty fit to me🤔😊🤤❤️🤗
I just love ❤️ the way you prepare you foods. Yummy 🤤! I also love the way you eat... not in a crappy way tho but it’s pleasing and not sloppy like some people are but I can definitely watch you forever
U should try the mr beast burger mukbang
How does he have this much subs than DJ cook
What is the music at 2:50 plz
feels like I'm watching a cooking show
Your camera👁️👅👁️
Wow super👏👏🌺
Who here genuinely searched for pewdiepies song, scrolled down because they were too lazy to type the song and saw this dudes perfectly symmetrical face and clicked the video ;-;
Like and love ❤️
Bruh zack stop, every time u say first bit is yours! I eat my phone. This is my 20th phone this month

Este weyy se embute solito, quiero que hagas un videos de una accion benefica, dando alimentos a los que no tienen.
I really wanted that first bite
pra que da esse mordidao que nem cabe na sua boca locao, seloco vai nos seus limites ai certo, boa pa nois

I want to live in a forest cottage with this man. That's all I got to say.

Zack is the best american mukbanger on youtube. He works so hard and does such a great job! It's always nice watching him.
Did He Just Make His Own Ground Beef ??👀👀 He’s Amazing & why can’t I stop watching 😂
И куда в него столько помещается?
Он повар?
Zack: eat's a whole menu....    me:......need food for a party anyone     also me RP with my self: WAIT ZACH..... YoU WoNt sHaRe!!!!!!
Pov: ur watching this at 4 am
Anyone noticed that he doesn't get fat? Howw
I’d like to see Gordon Ramsey’s comment on this
+1 άμα είσαι από την Ελλαδάρα

Get this man a cooking show

I'm so proud of his success

Questo è un insulto all italia , non si fanno così le lasagne
Come hai osato,hai rovinato una lasagnaaaaaa ( gli italiani capiranno...)
Never judge Choi by its cover..
Udah keren bikin video lu tod
His quality is better then my eye vision 😭😭
Oh my god 😍
Why are you so inaktiv

Dovresti farla con la besciamella e vero ragù ma sembra bona
You guys ever have that feeling where you are watching a food show/video and you want to jump in your device and eat all the food in the video? Yeah, me too.
10:22
QUALCUNO PER CASO HA DETTO ITALIA!
👍
The reason why i want to live alone😌
zachs bacc with da lasagna and no one talking bout da song it slaps👀
Zach: First bite is all yours! Me trying to fit a iPad in my mouth:👁_______________👁
Lindo pra caralho af
5:25 wow..i love the beat with the sizzling sound!!
How is he not fat
He makes dough look edible
The mkbhd for mukbang videos
this is a goddamn masterpiece
Follow his tiktok account trust me it’s amazing
sorry if its a bit rude but did you get a bit fat? (timestamp here)-> 10:34
HES BACK FINALLY
thats a lot of meat super!
eating lasagna while watching
Its soo much
Lasagna fun’s attendence here 👋👋👇🏼👇🏼
love this man
The way he smiles 😂
Very good ☺️😊☺️
Zach doesn’t cry from onions. Onions cry from him
Did you open your first corndog restaurant???
Hello! You have great videos! Thank you! ASMR is my love <3
What a perfect filming 😃 you just make asmr another level off being hot !!!🤩😍😍😘
😃😃😍😍😋
garfield lasang
Adorei o vídeo
strašně moc se mi líbí jak vaříš. Je neskutečné jak to máš vychytané, jak se zvukem tak i kamerově. Jsi opravdu moc dobrý :-)
Is that an AP?
Zach would definitely be A main character in attack on titan
Ah yes the wonderful algorithm giving me the content I want... I feel satisfied.
Is that the best you can do, poor effort!!!
Oh my god that thumbnail looks amazing..
みんなが思ったこと。なにこれ
your back!! after a month :D
your video very excellent
The editing in this is insane
the first part felt like watching a movie
amazing food
i subscribed when he had 300k now he has over 11mil
Oops my stomach go               *GrOwLlLlLllLlLlLllLlllLl*
Even pewdiepie cant sing that big
It's 8:03 am && I'm soooo hungry 😩 This looks amazingly delicious 😋
맛있겠다..😃
If i were him id throw my whole face on to the lasagna
nice ap
My question where's the mic in here mouth?
Yo, you did a great job preparing it! From an Italian  *thumbs up*
ma la musica in sottofondo per ascoltarla?
This is a movie channel!! <3
Excuse me Zach but this is not the real Bolognese lasagna, as a good Bolognese I know how to do it properly
Woooow that's a big slice of lasagne
Look good not going lie
He hasn't posted in a whole month lmao
As an Italian, Zach cooked lasagna better than some Italians
Is it weird how I think that Zach still looks handsome when he has huge mouth fulls of food in his mouth???                           I can’t be the only one who thinks so....              Right??? 👀                     Anyways. That’s it. That’s the comment.
Zach: knows how to cook    Gordan ramsey: now thats how u properly cook u fucking donut
Listening to him eat makes me wonder, do we all subconsciously try to suck our food in?
안녕 메신저 새 구독하지만 나는 당신의 새 비디오를 위해 거기에있을 것입니다
At this point, he can literally make a dang  movie about mukbang and I'll still watch🔥🔥🔥love the content💪
soooo satisfyinnng
Nggak bisa bahasa Inggris😭✌️
His first bite is like my whole dinner
Yay Zach Is Back The King Is Back
yea the food Looks good but are we gonna talk about his hands???
Is it just me or this guy ligits cooking
not cheesy enough
zach: first bite all yours also zach: luh asa ka
I love lasagna 😍😍😍
I'm guessing Zach has an intense exercise regime.
que manera de comer este chino
Music is so sad, oh.
lasang
Its so relaxing that i almost felt asleep..!!
Looks so yummy😍😍
You have improved the ASMR experience. Look forward to your videos every month!
The description says “if you do not like eating sounds do not watch” which made me laugh because the only type of ASMR I seem to enjoy (seriously I have tried so hard to like normal tapping and scratching ASMR and I just don't like it) is the kind with food. Cooking, eating, and now apparently egg cracking. 😂 anyway I really enjoyed the video.
5:01 :)
Reminds me of PewDiePie dis track
l don't remember paying for youtube premium ...
Who Else Want Zach Choi To Make A Cooking Channel?
“First bite is all yours”  Me at 3 am: Cries in hungry
Subhi
❤❤🖤🖤🖤💙💙💙💛🌼🧡🧡💜💜🌺🌺💐💐
Garfield punching the air rn 😔
You should do pho

I’m a pastry chef please consider supporting my channel 💕
Ya mouth big
Top
It’s the fact that I just ate lasagna
I just want to take a minute to give a shout out to all the fresh ingredients and made from scratch pasta and sauce that were used to create one of the most delectable looking lasagnas I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. I only wish that I was able to smell and taste it.  🤤 Zach....you are incredibly talented, awesome video.
This is so much more than just a mukbang. Amazing 🤩
Garfield watching this be like: 🤤🤤🤤
The smile 😢❤❤❤
Him: *Pours flour in bowl* Also him: *Pours the flour again on cutting board*
Beach Lasagna
This dude got everything. He is doing everything organically. Damn must be nice
When the US shuts down,  Everyone:
THAT'S A BIGGGGG BOIIII :DDD
Lol hungry
Quick question how tf your not fat yet
You crazy
You crazy
You cray
You are so handsome and nice and you are my favorite youtuber
Really goin outta his way to make us hungry huh                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             yea.
P
Love you zach
I like the part where when he puts the pizza flour it looks like he's poring down cokecaine
Gua kira asmr madu eh ternyata
Bro slow down the lasagna isn’t gonna get up and run away😂😂😂
garfield?
The title should be  "Welcome to the virtual date with Zach Choi"
ok. we do not eat the garlic, we leave it whole by cutting it only, we remove it at the end of cooking. In the sauté we also use carrot and celery. Zach, you did a great job. You studied well. Good boy!
Prof at it’s finest
I work my ass off in construction for this guy to sit in front of a camera and eat into a microphone and gets paid 100x more than me? What a fucking world we live in.
6:16 oh so thats how minecraf got its brewing stand sound          wait this video is NEW sooo DOES THAT MEAN MOJANG TOOK HIS SOUND WHEN THE VIDEO WAS NOT OUT YET HUHH?????
Fun fact: lasagna is just pizza flavour cake
All his vids is like the best of the best like just wow also the food he make all looks very delicious.wish I could have a taste of his food lol😁😁😁😁
does anyone else just randomly craves flour or cornstarch ? no ? just me 💀
Remember when he did these everyday
Is he a sheaf or a YouTuber because it looks like he’s a sheaf NGL
One question... how?? 😃👏👏
Them black gloves have touched more things than Zach’s own hand
A little bit mad because I'm starving while he making that huhu
What was the liquid he added after the basil
When I saw him cooking, I thought it was an anime for a sec or was it just me blacking out from how awesome the quality was
Sorry I know mustang vids are popular etc but the way this guy eats its just absurd. Who tf thats normal eats this way?
John Cena Is The Face Of Wwe. Zach Is The Face Of Mukbang.
Na ssatespay ako Dzai
Me watching at 2 am: 😃🔫
Garfield is typing....
why is he so fancy?!?!  setting my standards way too high 💜
Nice
ok
10:35
PERFECTION ❤️
the intro was longer then the eating lol but still this intro is like a movie like i could watch on a movie night and i bet gordan ramsy would lovveee the intro
O mano ficou tão rico que posta 1 vídeo por semana
*Garifield* wants to know your location.
Can you do one cooking and eating beignets?😊 please thank you❤❤
No one:  Redwine: ohk ohhhhhk ohhk
Idk but is it just me I thought I heard sailor moon for the song 😆😂🥮🍜🌙
This is a cooking channel not an eating channel now
Zach looks like a tattoo artist on lunch break
Bruh wtf did u do like bro u messed up everything. Se ci sono italiani qui perfavore non morite e fatevi forza e non fatelo vedere alle vostre nonne e se lo avete fatto RIP
I was here when he had 20k... now look at him he got 11 mill
He got manners
make longer than eat .....skip to 11:40 ......
When I was little I watched Zach and I always thought he was Japanese but I’m 15 and I still think he’s Japanese but he’s Korean at least I think ?? Lol idk
Wow!!! I was full after the first bite!
a chef
Dude put some much love into the Lasagna he ended up deepthroating it
My favorite part of the lasagna is the top.
cinematography chef kiss
I was he would T-A-L-K I promise I will support him he just seems so innocent and I would love to hear what he sounds like with or without whispering
My guy went from uploading weekly to uploading once or twice a month, I can’t believe no one noticed this
I know this is like really late but if you don't already have a video idea for food maybe you an make your daily food that you eat for breakfast and lunch you get the idea you don't have to do it for the next video you can do it for also another day but this is just a suggestion so you really don't have to do it
that lasagna look good as hell 😋
Do more videos
Forget asmr I’m tryna see Zach on the cooking channel 🔥🔥 master chef, chopped, any of them really
It's funny how he gives us the recipe like I'm gonna make it😂
His toilet is probably saying “Why am I in this house?”
This channel isn’t an ASMR channel anymore it’s literally a cooking show....
Watching this while fasting was a bad idea
Tô gostando !muito dos seus vídeo Achei bem legal
It's a tv ad who agrees 👍👍
I’m not hungry, you’re hungry
I really like the editing and all the effort but i just really want you to go back when you did every other day
Looks good bro
The new Gordon Ramsey
The whole 10 minutes of cooking were so interesting and satisfying that I forgot that it was a mukbang lol
Mamahuevo el que lo leea
The question is: how?                                       Oh hello hottie ;b
Best waifu
i miss old zack
Zac Choi doesn’t realize this, but he’s making everyone’s quarantine better
Who Repeat My coment gau
*Gordon Ramsey left the chat*
My eyes started getting watery when he started cutting them onions 😂
Teacher: No eating in class! That one kid in the back:
Por donde te metes el p*to microfono para amigo
Anyone else want to vomit?
Me: I hate hearing people eat and taking big bites... Also me: I love watching zach choi tho..🤪
i gotta say... the size of that first bite is lowkey an insult to the lasagne...
hiiii bang coi
Zach:eats very nicely  Me with my knife and fork: *SHING SHING SHING*
Voice reveal
That looks so bomb 👁️👄👁️
How fat is he like this mans eating thousands of calories in one sitting regularly at talk about unhealthy
TRY NOT TO TALK CHALLENGE 🤣🤣
Capitalism
Indonesian food plz ❤️❤️❤️
❤️
He's making movies out of mukbangs💕
Will Gordon Ramsay eat this
Asu mau
title: 4k me: *watches it in 480p*
How you bin
Opening the wine bottle should have not been in there
Am I the only one who noticed my man is bust down in a literal AP
O que está acontecendo com ele ? Posta vídeo raramente 😔 é uma pena
The cinematics, drew me innn😭
Anybody here on a diet or just me
whos watching this in an empty stomach ?
Man can leave YouTube anytime and become a chef..
5:01 no se porque esperaba algun sonido en esa parte XD O por cierto la lasaña es mi platillo favorito después de toda la comida tradicional Mexicana ÙwÚ 🇮🇹 (no hay bandera de México XD)
Who else only watches Zach to see his iron chef level cooking skill?😁 Zach you are talented and nothing will ever change that you rock!👏
Yum yum
10:20 he finishes cooking
You should do birria tacos or authentic Mexican tacos
The first bite he took was like a whole dinner portion for me 😹
you can eat normally bro, there is no need to just full your mouth that the food spill out of it
Some al Dente pasta finally 🤌🏼🙌🏼 that’s what I’m talking about
So cool

This guy : *Literally eats anything*  Also this guy : *MUKBANG*
FINNALY REEEEEEEEE
Hi Happy ❤❤❤❤❤
Your such a passionate cook and your food always looks amazing I wish you could cook for me
Garfield wants to know your location
Kekenyangan nih yeee... Gak abesss
I’m kinda concerned for Zach. Idk maybe it’s just me but he doesn’t seem as excited in these videos anymore, he’s uploading less which is causing him to get less views too.
Is he a chef also?.. or was??.. cuz his talent is INSANE!
Your video quality is very insane respect 🙏🙏💯
OMG! This dude clearly needs to make a restaurant.
Let’s be honest, u all thought that jach king will stop posting, u wanted himto post And now your happy that he’s posting again
That would go cold before you could finish half of it. Nice lasagna tho.
This is how many people think Zach should upload more often 👇🏻
yummyyyyyyy
Judges: Who smiles only with their eyes? Zach: Let me introduce myself.
The way you cook , the time you put in , how you enjoy the food its so fabulous , Thank you for the video ,really like it .
Omg that looks so good..love how u showed us how u made everything your self..I am drooling
Why he is eating too much
the music kinda ruins the asmr effect :/
Nose si me entiendes Hola
Io che guardo come fa la lasagna e dici : mi posso suicidare......
He made his own pasta as well, he puts in so much extra effort to make the content good I love that
All of a sudden I’m hungry
Glenn is that you?
Бич лазанья
My mom: “You have to eat!” Me: “Can I have Lasagna?”
So freakin hungry right now!
my gosh man... if they ever have an award ceremony for best Mukbang channel, you would win it all i swear... seriously like ... this should be on TV
Who made it legal for this man videography to be this 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Zach Choi is the king of asmr LITERALLY
THAT LOOKS DELICIOUS 😋😛🤤
No one:                                                    Zach:first bite is all yours                   Also zach :and the rest of it is for me
HOW DID YOU EATED THIS ALL?
Why does the tumbnail make a lasingya look so good
is it just me or when he eats the sound is so satisfying
That lasagna from scratch, looks soo delicious!!!😋👍
:Garfield my lansgana 😭 :me  go  get some more 😑
Him:"saying for bite is all yours"             me:actually takes bite out of screen-
You won’t have to eat for days
Caralho mano, isso é muito satisfatório...
How can you eat all this 😱
I would love to see gorden ramsay to react to your cooking
make more now a sea food one or something more more
Ok now I understand how our dogs and cats feel when we eat.
Mate Gordon Ramsay schould see this masterpiece👌🏻👌🏻
WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO ME
No Water or Something...
Mukbang
That's one big ass fork right there
Good❤️❤️
Good broooo
Wᴀʜʜ!!! Yᴏᴜ ᴀʟʀᴇᴀᴅʏ ʜᴀᴠᴇ 11.1ᴍ sᴜʙs?! Aᴍᴀᴢɪɴɢ!!!
I just need to know how can he eat that much, my friend can't eat his first bite...😂😂😂😂
how is he sooo fit after eating so much food! Thats impressive!!
What a wonderful glimpse into food preparation. There are so many eaters (mostly American) out there who’s consumption is frightening. Thx for the reality check and ASMR.
Mmmmm🥺
okay you did not have to take that first bite like that sheesh
The image quality of your videos is incredible.
As an italian, I stan this video.
I loved how dedicated he was on making the lasagna sheets from scratch and the “better than most culinary videos” ragù! As an Italian I appreciated all his effort so much! Only a tip: next time make bechamel/white sauce in place of the ricotta+mozzarella. It will made the lasagna moist and super tasty! Sprinkle Parmesan on top with little pieces of butter and make everything brown in the oven. Your outcome will be even tastier and super cruncy!! Keep up the wonderful work! ;)
Who else thinks the garlic chopping is the best part?🤤🧄🧄
La lasagna non si lavora con il mixer ma sei pazzo
For italian first reaction shok   Gg for lasagna
I’m italian... you have did descritament this lasagne
Epic lasagna 😋 so esthetically pleasing 🤤
Sono italiano... le hai fatte discretamente. Bene queste lasagne 😜
You have like 100000000 microphones
the amount of food this man can fit in his mouth
Imagine him on Thanksgiving
When o have my next birthday it’s gonna be a bday lasagne
U should open up a restaurant
OMG im a italian its not a lasagnaaaaaaa
Zach: First bite is all your Me: HE JUST ATE IT YOU SAID IT WAS MINE
Mans just says “fuck it, imma upload today” 💀
I swear it looks so good
Zach:eating a full meal  Me:eating hot pockets and spaghetti
Zach Choi, sounds like the name of the new student who becomes almost the most popular student in 5 days
10:41 woah dude chill take smaller bites
Where’s the sprite at?
:( what taste like
Хочу жрать
this good man, just one thing with ground beef is it for lasagna or bolognese, always season meet right before its gonna be half cooked not in the beginning and second thing touch of cinnamon is gonna bring that aroma and flavor to the onother level, and yes oregano very important for all the dishes this type!
i js bought some new headphones n this headphones make the vid sound so good
Me also wondering do these ppl workout?
Me telling myself chew 37times before swallowing or I'll get fat but this guy just swallowed a whole lasagna and still slim 😒😒😖😖
Xxx: você  come muito?  Eu:
Mds que sonho
Very impressive!!
In life u just don't have to be genius, intelligent, hot, beautiful, entertaining. U just have to be CREATIVE.
Yummy 🤤 💭
That lasagna looks super gooood
Check cash credit 👌👏👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️😊😊😊😊😄😄😄😄😎😎😎✌️✌️✌️😉😉😉😏😏😏😏😏😏😏😏
Zach Choi is one of the most unhated mukbagers
I also do ASMR . I'm a good girl . I want to work with you . Take me to your place .🥰🥰🥰
Le petit couteau français 😲
Am soo impressed, waaaay to go buddy 😍😍👍🏼👍🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Zach: “First bite is all yours” Me: **Takes a bite of my screen** My Mom: “What are you doing?” Me: “Nothing, absolutely nothing.”
who remembers when he bought takeout and not cook
Wtf??😂
I require a fit with Sas Asmr, pleaseeeeee((( 🥺🥺🥺🥺 I have a fit 🥺🥺🥺
THAT FIRST BITE IS A WHOLE MEAL IN LIKE 10 SECONDS
can we just appreciate he tells us how he makes the food in the subtitles-     i also like how it took more time to make it then eat it
*Omg this video is trending in Pakistan 🇵🇰❤️*
Free readings for everyone on my channel 🌞
Faaak your tato
Gotta love and hate Zach.  I respect the man's craft and love that he shows recipes and has high quality everything.  I hate the asshat because he stole my life happiness.  I guess I'm just glad someone gets to do this for a living.  Im just jealous.  DO IT BIG ZACH!
It isn't lasagna
Bruh he’s a chef and a asmr god
شكلي انا الوحيدة السعودية هنا 🤣🤣😂
That first bite was 😍
This is soooo chilll 😴🤤
Vibes

Garfield: *WHY YOU NOT GIVE DAT LASANGA TO ME?*
1:14 what tf they going flomp flomp flomp
typical asmr: Showing what you are eating Introducing Store bought food Start eating Zach choi: Nice music Ambient sounds (before eating) Cinematic experience Introduction deluxe (homemade) food Start eating (this is what every asmrtist have)
Hmm im  Imagining how he craved lasanga and i  Imagined garfield idont know why 😂

Perfect video. I just have one request: take the gloves off when eat, pleeeease. 😅
Makam
I immediately retreated here after being disgusted at seeing a clip of Big Ed eating ribs, your videos always help increase my appetite and are perfection! 😌

Ma mangia bellu bellu.
Salad pls

I love that he cooks his own food. Takes the time instead of just ordering it
Hes a PROFFESINAL CHEF !
Man i know these cooking video r satisfying but im waiting for the mukbang......
ZACH CHOI's lasagna is all the ASMR empire needed
His first bite is my whole fricking lunch
imagine Zach Choi as your personal chef
Looks very good
HOW DID HE TAKE IT ALL OUT OF THE CONTAINER
This video is all about cooking
Probably the first time I have seen him not finish a meal
Garfield wants to: Know your location
His decorations looks awesome and if upgrade his decorations he will eat outside like forest
Lasagna and forest
ماكو عرب 🙂
Zach: Makes super duper very cool intro   Me: Skip the intro.

Lasagna is my favorite food! I'm so happy Zach decided to make one 😍
The fact that he also makes his own food!!
Everyone : Satisfing Me:🤤🤤
Someone get a collab with @BingingwithBabish @BabishCulinaryUniverse on the phone!
Only ocs know that zach choi used to like every comment
Zach please do a live video
Might wanna call this the Garfield challenge! 😳
Omg😣
I feel that zach is making lasagna because biden came to the white house
When he's shots are more appealing and cinematic than the commercials you see on tv.
I want to see Zach get drunk
I'm been here since 1 million it's been nice to see you grow
я один русский?
Ma nun ta sapiv fa na bell agl e uogl
it must take him forever to not only cook all that but to film everything in such high quality too. it takes agEsss. not to mention he has to present it well and set the cameras. hopefully his food aint too cold by the time he's finished setting up. the feeling of accomplishment must make the food taste that much better tho.
Gardfield would be happy
You know he’s serious when he uses scissors and not the rip tab on the bag😯
Always waiting for your update❤👨‍🍳
I think he can eat the whole planet up if he had the chance to do it, The king is indeed back  💜💜💜
Are we in a simulation 👁️👄👁️

Zack is the king of asmr eating
It takes time to make that. I can see his hardwork.
Garfield will come back for the rest of the lasagna 😂
Imagine Micheal Rosen in mukbang

How tf do you stay so fit
6:16 that legit sounded like the sound when a potion is brewed in minecraft
When you become a  Italian i’m pretty sure that your Korean Japanese Mexico Caribbean Canada On the way to cook
i heard you were hiring cameramen
Капец аж апетит разыграося
did he forgot to open a can for drinking ?
I’m curious as why you don’t make homemade Korean food? I’ve always wanted to see you make kimchi and some other types of Korean cooking that would educate your viewers. Please!
Me watching Zach for almost a year me still not knowing what asmr stands for
Davie504 should see this
Thats the biggest lasagna I have ever seen
My man got some red wine
Thiss isss beautiful.. but i'm curious, his views has always been so high. I'm scared you are shadowbanned or what.. sighhhh youtube youtube
Так жрать нельзя
I, love the sound😘😋
It’s funny I just ate lasagna and I’m no longer that hungry for thirds.
me: Zack wat yu eating rice or  pasta Zack :  BOTH
big ass lasagna
Ele comeu um inseto junto kkkkk
Your making everyone hungry

Minecraft
Youtube: bueno en este video puedes ver a un coreano cocinando y comiendo  Yo: de one quiero verlo 😀
Who needs culinary school when u can watch zach's videos?
when and where did you learn to cook?
You are little similar with bts jin
This is what commercials should look like low-key
I wonder how is his teeth doing🤔😂
geez that lasagna looks bomb af
Who else is skipping to the eating part
And onions
The tomatoes though that was mad satisfying
The whole time I watched him prep I’m like: he’s better than Gordon Ramsey
This video is art. I love it!
This makes me wanna cook from scratch despite all the work 😩 this was very satisfying to watch and it looked so delicious
The thumbnail tho 💀
I Can't Even Eat One Slice Without Getting Full😭
Garfield would be proud 🤧
More Stephanie soo pls
is the best ASMR
Mantap
What my mom serves me when I’m doing a diet
The cinematography, sound and  video is amazing as always 🙌🔥💯
Me watching this without eating much cause i had to much homework
I like how Zach doesn't speak at all. Like other ASMR's will whisper. But then put "*no talk*" Just relax and enjoy the noise
🥲 “first bite all yours”  *say less*                                                             I ate like 5G so I think I’m full now
Thank you for giving us the recipe to thia food 😇
The new cooking show?
your really good at cooking
Culinary but make it asmr and *MUKBANG*
I thought he had 13 million
《⊙~⊙》
When he made his own ground beef I was truly amazed. Looks amazing 😛
The quality is so HD... SO EPIC
Я один русский
h
He'd totally win a food eating contest tbh. He's practiced his jaw long enough
watching this vidio 4k on my pc  Ohhhh its so good graphic
*Garfield wants to know your location*
very Good Zach Choi
Bro who’s an og and has been here si ce he hit 3 mil
I feel like I’m watching the cooking scene in Ratatouille 🥰
This video was made on my birthday wish I saw it then 😂
bro
Garfield would have ate that in on bite
サムネに釣られてやってきた人です。海外の料理は大きいものが多いのかなと思ってたんだけどこれ手作りなのか!!!この量を作るのは大変そうだけど、めちゃくちゃ美味しそう(*´﹃`*) ところで日本人いる?
If u don’t like the cooking part and just want mukbang here is when he starts eating: 10:20
Yay, Zach is back
Is anyone else worried about that last ingredient in the sauce I mean it was just red it look kind of like blood he didn’t say what it was I’m just saying it could be human blood
Okay, Zach! Love the color presentation 🌿🌴🌳☘️🍀🌵🪴🌿🌱
Garfield is happy
there should be no reason you’re shoving your mouth like this.
Took much time to cook then to eat it but It was worth it
He eats a lot, But he’s not fat. How does he do it? We all don’t know that. But who cares? Cuz most importantly,      HES BACC
Is Very good 🤤❤️
I have so much appreciation for Zach because he makes his food a lot! (From scratch)
I love how happy he looks while eating the lasagna☺️
The thing that zach choi bought a pasta maker for the sake of this video😂
i wanted to see the meat being ground :(
Half the video is zack cooking
im the type of person who skip the cooking and just watches him eat if your like me hit the like buttun
Just a suggestion...maybe you can try to make Soba from My Hero Academia QwQ

郁闷 (⊙o⊙)
OK WHAT your intro is on a whole nother level
Bruh I have mistakenly click the thumbs down button I thought I would of died😭...why do ppl do that (don't worry I fixed it with a thumbs up😊)
Why does people dislike a video that's relaxing, makes you hungry, and you can learn recipies?
Non osare chiamarla lasagna, tiranno!
The god is back!!
The documentary Human Harvest was shown at universities and libraries in Virginia Beach, Richmond, Williamsburg, Henrico, and Charlottesville, all in Virginia, on October 17-21, 2019. A Q&A session followed each screening.  Canadian human rights lawyer David Matas and representative of Doctors Against Forced Organ Harvesting (DAFOH) Dr. Jessica D. Russo were present to answer questions from the audience after the screening.  The film covers the independent investigations carried out by David Matas and former Canadian Secretary of State (Asia Pacific) David Kilgour into the organ trade in China, where organs are taken without consent from prisoners of conscience, as well as documents the communist regime's crimes against humanity.   Human rights lawyer David Matas (second on right) with other event organizers  The first screening held at Virginia Wesleyan University attracted many lecturers and students, as well as local residents. Martha, a student from Iran, said, “I cried many times while watching the film. Falun Dafa practitioners are the most kindhearted people I've ever met in my life. How can the Chinese government treat these people so cruelly?”   The first showing of Human Harvest was held at Virginia Wesleyan University.  Lecturers received thank you letters from students after the first screening. According to Craig Wansink, director of Virginia Wesleyan University's center for the Study of Religious Freedom, after the film, students discussed the issue of organ harvesting and told others about it. The university plans to create opportunities for students to help stop what the communist regime is doing.  The final screening was held at the University of Virginia's School of Law during its obsevance of Human Rights Week. Nelson Camilo Sánchez León, the director of the International Human Rights Law Clinic, commented after the film that he and his students gained a deeper understanding of forced organ harvesting and that it demands people’s attention. He thought it was very educational.  A discussion held on the afternoon of October 21 informed many students and professors of the atrocities taking place in China. Many professors from the School of Medicine watched the film at the medical school afterward. Some of them were experts in organ transplants.
3:20 give that dough a good smack
Dang
Amazing! Where can I find the recipe?
omg, you are a master chef!
What do you do w the rest of the food you don’t eat? Hope you save it as left overs or give it to the homeless
For real does Zach have a mic in his mouth bro
The whole time all i could think about was Garfield
Eating starts at 10:35
Well my mom makes lasagna, but she doesn't make the pasta itself. That's crazy.
tbh some of the sounds are just  IDLT (i don’t like them)
Oi sou do brasil
Imagine Zach saying ' dinner is ready'🤤
Yesss
I swear he had 10mil last Sunday
Boa noite gato ☺☺😘😘😋😋😋
One of the best keep it up choi
First bite and the eye smile that's it that's the comment
Looks wonderful. I’m not a big lasagna lover but this looks damn delicious. A man that knows how to cook is a good man to have around!
So this is how my dog feel when I'm eating..
Te me lo terminas o te me lo terminss crick 😂😂
احسه يشبه تشانق ولد موناك
me currently fasting   also me currently t*rturing myself
*Gordon Ramsey Would Like To Know Your Location.*
este weon mas lo que come y no engorda xD
Oh to have a bite 😔
Just IMAGINE Zach going against Gordon Ramsay like the drama.
You are the best mukbang/cook ever it’s so satisfying how u eat, how u cook and everything
É só eu que gosta de ver isso
okay but Zach Choi is the best asmrist out
bro do u share ur food
gwd👏
Can u make me some pls 🥺🥺😂😂
It really bums me out that someone unironically watched this
PERO KHE NO NO ENTIENDO WACHOOOOOOOOOOO
E- khe wea
Garfield: GIVE ME MY LASAGNA
la mozzarella nelle lasagne  hai dei seri problemi
If I were blind I would find this more disturbing of a sound than I can now.  I understand muckbang,  but muckbang asmr is wrong.  This sound is something disgusting, like watching a weird geriatric porn with a blind fold on.
Zach choi first bite is all yours  eats my slice
La sack nga
i see your chunky
Sorry zach where is besciamella? 😭
The garlic slices ✨
watching him cut the garlic with a knife that big felt like a chain saw holy moly
Does Mukbang mean "takes the biggest bite u possibly can without choking"? XD
Why do mukbangers make a gallon of sauce put a single drop on the chicken and then proceed to eat the entire chicken nugget, tender, fry etc
Can I have some jus put the food towards the screen I’ll grab it   No ..put it towards- th- o-over here n-no no don’t eat it  give it to me n-no
Good with your ear phones you can hear  the music and the asmr
nobody:  this guy: time lapses every minute detail of his cooking  but fr tho... this is artwork. not easy to do   unless you get used to it.
Pure art. We love you man. Thank you !!!
*Zach Choi ASMR: The First Bite All Yours* *Me: *Eats My Ipad**
Is it just me or is this lasagna looking kinda   THHHHHHHHHHHICCCCCC
Fat was
Super الصوت روعة
The pasta just doesn’t cook right burnt on outside rubber on inside
he really said, "gag reflex? never heard of her"
Sorry but I personally love pasta when it comes to fettuccini or pesto or red sauce I eat it practically as the average person eats pancakes for breakfast but lasagne is by far one of my least favorite
This man is a genius
This is my second time watching this video. The first one (yesterday) I felt sleep as soon as the video started. I couldn’t finish it 🤣🤣🤣 p
This man just ate a serving in one bite😅😂
This is THE largest lasagna I have ever seen someone eat in such a short time frame 😅
This video disturbs me to the core of my heart and also is that ground beef in there
ADAKAH PENONTON INDONESIA
It's so big XDDDDDDD
Yo his editing be fire, and his food is fire, so is his asmr and quality
when the italians see this, their going to be like "YO HELP ME IN THE KITCHEN!, WE COOKING MeAtBaLlS!
Zach: eats a whole loaf of lasagna   Me: breathes air.    ᕦ(ಠ_ಠ)ᕤ

Zack is really good but i'm italian, and it really hurt me not to see the original recipe
Zach choi is not cooking, cooking is zach choi
The music is so soothing to my ears it calms me down. Thank so much for that ❤️
When he says take the first bite I'm thinking is he really going to eat after us I mean hello covid will be knocking on your door like peekaboo in minutes

Zach could be a speed eater
Listen to 15:03
Nice editing
He literally talks with his eyes.
I don't know why but, it has more of the cooking part instead of the eating part, which is the thing we crave the most.
I am hungry 😭💀
I feel bad for his toilet
If yu do asmr your the biggest weirdos alive
The music is so calming
모짜렐라 치즈로 국수에만 도전
Can you eat Candy Floss? :-D. I love your videos.
Waw I'd my stomach to be huge enough to eat this whole plate

Qualcuno che gli insegna a cucinare?
i missed this! "first bite is all ours" mehehe ❤️
This fucking music ruins the asmr
I wanna marry this guy 😫
Please eat Turkish Food "Yağlama"
when the music started playing i imagined Zach dancing around and fluttering wtf brain
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🔴
This is a literal masterpiece!! I feel like I've watched an artistic movie lol
.
Banda encontré a Puvlo xd
those hands, my god! it's soooo manly!😍
Wow 11million you deserve it amazing

Great Work! I felt like if I'm observing nature. Thank You.

한국어 할 줄 아세요?
Times up who you gone choose? ⌛️look ⬇️     Jesus loves you all so very much!! He died taking the punishment of our sins on the cross and rose three days later so we can live righteous and go to heaven he is the way truth and life!! ❤️🥺   Don’t follow the ways of the devil he hates you he wants us all in hell. He is prideful selfish and the father of lies. He despises all people who look in the image of GOD (us). 💀
Italian cooks after watching this: *sweating intensifies*
The onion I'm crying 😭😂
Zach in 10 years      Eating steak inside a cage with lions and tigers
That is one good looking tomatoes sauce
O my god

The way he cooks is better than a cooking ad and the result is even better
What's the secend song name in video please say to me
Im hungry e
This man should own a 5 star restaurant because I would go there every day.
❤️🙏💗
why doesn't he chew?
Italian: “what the hell I’m watching...”
At this point I would say that Zach Choi is a Chef
How is he skinny  I DONT NEED SLEEP I NEED ANSWERS
Great, Zach! If you want to improve and cook the real italian version, I advise you to use the classic "ragù bolognese" instead of marinara, "besciamella" instead of ricotta and mozzarella and totally avoid the basil inside and on the surface! And put some grated parmesan on the last layer, so it will make the crust!😋
The cooking reminds me one of those nice anime’s scenes where they make their food
He didnt said that first bite is all yours
I never skip the first part because me who is 18 already don’t even know how to cook.
He’s still not chewing his food enough. It’s still obvious that he’s swallowing so hard 😢
Yo zach 맛있어,
I feel like he amazed himself with this one... The initial look of happiness when he took the first bite, then the little smiles and head tilts thereafter... I love watching people be happy with food they've created themselves.
"I like the Mexican or Russian stylish background music🤓"
ㅋㅋㅋ
Lasagna I am starving
God bless u Zach
Omg It looks delicious!!

joj Kitajec
🤤🤤
How many are Indians  Like
Where’s your drink man? Gotta have something nice to wash that delicious food down.
I think this gf is so lucky
Honestly the cooking is more satisfying than the eating
Bring back normal mukbangs, fast food and rollers every day
Zach: making lasagna,burger,sushi and many other food. Me: making omelet
The graphics sounds and cooking was amazing
Zach ever thought of opening a restaurant. Cause believe me I would have ordered every meal from your menu.😂😋
I been here since 6mil now look at him all grown up 😔
wiimusic
É magro de ruim
If ramsay taste this he will say disgusting because of the greesy
Uhooooooooooo is deliciousಠ_ಠ
O MY GOD THIS IS SOO RELAXING AND SO GOOD🤤🤤🤤
I really want to hear his voice
6:15 that was satisfying 😌
Русские умерли

New rule in my household if Zach choi can eat it all, we can eat it all 😄
Nice like broo😘❤️❤️
Good brooo❤️❤️
I am italian, and I can assure you that the preparation was perfect😂
HOW DOES HE EAT SO MUCH AND STILL NOT GET FAT

Bravo Zach! Bellissimo!
Now your not the only one who can smile with your mouth
Nice

I know zach was embarrassed in the first bite
Zach Choi camera tricks more like Zach King

C'è qualche italiano oltre a me?  ( non avevo mai visto una lasagna senza salsa)
What is the name of the wrist watch? Thank you for your answer
Imagine Our Old Zach.

Omg a man that can cook... N from scratch too... I wanna some now... Wish I could have tasted yours
Impara a fare il raguuuu ahahhahah
Zach when he tastes his food: 😃
10:35 how?🤣 what a giant hole
I want lasagna now 😤
Quanti italiani che fan le lasagne alla bolognese con sugo di pomodoro già pronto, preparato per soffritto surgelato e macinato già pronto?✋🏻😂
The lasagna eaten like this with a spoon cannot be seen! 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
I'll bet this is the best danggone lasagna EVER!! 😋 Kudos to you, for the homemade ingredients. "I am impressed.."
His metabolism is faster than the flashes camera man
I think the cameraman gets the other half
Yes he is an mechanic too
Why is ur hands shaking bro  Is everything OK BTW nice asmr
Omg what happened to Zach Choi? Stares less and looks at his food more lovingly. I love it :0 ngl he looks more adorable now as he looks more at his food.
6:16 sounds familiar to me...
Zach idk if you love food or filming or both but you should consider filmmaking your visual and angles are Top notch SuperB!
im over here eating sum scrumbled egg damn :(
Tanboy kun vs zhack asmr
Garfield must be so proud
Siapa yg dri indo😂☝️
Yum that looks delicious
The cooking is a cinematic masterpiece
I bet ur stomach be hurting
Zach: First bite is all yours  Me: *literally opens my mouth
Come back too this comment when Zach reaches 1.5million subs
Oh Jesus..
Big fan been since 1k subs
0:13 I've never liked egg so much in my life lmao
...
Watching this while im on a diet 🥲
Ur first bite is literally the whole piece of lasagna I can eat at lunch lmao
The lasagna looks great but u shouldn’t have put mozzarella on. We usually put “besciamella” (I’m Italian)
How are we getting this for free?
Zach : first bite is always yours Me : *Bites An Air And Just Relized Zach Takes It Away * Me: Wow Rudee Much Like Very Much My mind :  |}itch stop doing that ;--;
I’m surprised he ate half a quarter of it I wouldn’t have been able to eat that much
Extremely amazed to see your fast journey of 11M in just 2 years 🎉🎉, your just amazing♥️♥️ , awesome keep rocking, we are there for you 🤗
Schmeckt save geil
He ate the lasagna with a wooden spork! (if anyone gets the reference lol)
Dude honestly Gordon Ramsay should rate ur cooking
Not satisfying when u shove it all in there at once
What a big bite
The quality of this channel has gone up like crazy ! Kudos to your work ❤️
The only ASMR channel I like
Me: yeah, i can cook. Also me: sees video intro Also also me: *actually no, I can't.*
Me gustaria ser mago para poder replicar tus comidas
eu n tenho paciência pra fazer um miojo
Long time no see
wooooo
zach is not good now I dont like him now I think he is now pure asmr
This video is very satisfying
As an Italian I can say this is not exactly how you make a lasagna. No cream cheese, no mozzarella, and the ragù is all wrong
I’m Italian and that lasagna is AMAZING!
Zach why you a pro chef??
Of Lasagne
Pure master piece of lasagna
Zach Choi has the coolest cooking equipments.
Look so yummy 😋😋
Como vim para aqui
Does zach ever get full
Can I be your future wife?! For real!!
Homemade lasagna 😋
Ok am I the only one wondering how he got the entire lasagna out of the pan
Bro where can I get all of these use cooking utensils
Hi broi
only eating please
imagine your hunger with all these filming you have to slow down the process of cooking for these masterpiece and being able to finally ingest this dish rawr😂
doctors: humans need oxygen to survive zach: pretty sure it doesn't
the begining is sick
At this point, i think he is trying to make fun of us
feels like in YouTube premium
The comment section is all just compliments
Wihhhhh:v
The rest of the lasagna os for hes girlfriend
Worth every weeks of waiting.
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen.. Repent and turn from sin! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out.
This is awesome!

People who didn't skip the cooking part ⏬

1 month wait was worth it !
元気そうでなにより
Shadow band LOL
Saludos desde mexico me encantan tu videos
Am i the only one who tortures myself watching these for fun
he use tik tok lets goooo
The way his hands shook when he started eating was concerning
I swear every bite is about 1 entire serving of lasagna 😂😂
Zach Choi is the reason I’m learning to cook, I follow what he does and it’s truly amazing how I succeeded in making the lasagna. This was my first time making lasagna, and I just want to say thank you so much Zach. If this video was never made, I probably would not be making lasagna.
2:18 😳
The only person who can smile with his eyes..
The music, the quality, just gets better👌
I’m curious why muckbangers feel the need to almost choke themselves when eating 😂 just eat normal. No need to take a big ass bite 😂😂😂
Better use earphone
♥
he just gave us a whole cooking video I love it💕😂
Beach lasagna beach lasagna
Zach choi can go on Gordon Ramsey show man I bet that food will taste so good im jealous🤤
How does he cook so good??? Lol Best chef goes to my boi Zach lol
Garfield would be happy about this>_<
What if Zach had a cooking channel?
sei la acho que ele fica duas semanas sem comer porque ele come com uma puta vontade vei... que delicia.
Ohhhh,he FaNcYyYyYy
Garfield In A Nutshell  John: Garfield eat your lasagna! Garfield: No I'm not feeling to well John..
omg what if Zach is Corpse Husband thats why he doesnt talk, otherwise we will know, and corpse only shows us voice, so we dont know its Zach🤯
I appreciate waiting for the olive oil to collect in the middle of the pot before cutting to the next ingredient. Lol
Adimita vc ver os videos dele comendo alguma coisa 🙃
"very good chef" gordan Ramsey is typing
Ok but the smile he makes when he eats🥺 it’s like so wholesome
If garfield was here he will eat the whole thing. One bite.
I am diying help me
Time 10:36 he starts to eat thanks me later
He’s definitely a VIRGO 😁 presentation says it all
how does he manage to smash almost a whole lasagna 🤣🤣
Wow zach is obviously flexing his cooking skills on us while us we can’t cook good 😭😭😭
This isn’t a mukbang this is art
this dude made his own ground beef
1 month is one mukbang
This is more to mukbang not asmr
le lasagna.
I think zach choi forgot to fill the sprite in his glass at first
Wait, you’re on trendiiing!
I think you don’t need music. Because it’s a ASMR!!!
I can really see the beauty of food and cooking thanks to Zach
Pensé que era un anuncio de comida xd.
0:37
The lasagna looks amazing zack!!
Amazing quality
Such a professional work😵
Plot Twist: drops it from the oven
He can literally start a restaurant with his cooking skills.
This dude should've done a voice reveal in 2021 rewind

Lausamgua

Those veins, Daddy chill
i made lasagna for dinner tonight because i couldn’t stop thinking abt this video
I’m so hungry
how do u eat so much and not get fat
Anyone else get really angry at his face when he eats??? Like what tf are you smiling 😃
6:15      Noicee
Just imagine Zach had tiktok and showing off the food he made Gordan Ramsay will be beaten forever
I thought I saw a cake in the thumbnail
Lu udah lama ga bikin konten Lu udah di atas tapi lu malah ga semangat bikin konten Dulu gua support lu, tapi sekarang lu malah gini ajg, kecewa gua
This man is a actual chef
When I was watching this I started to skip to the eating but then went back bcuz I know how much work he put in to make these masterpieces     Much love ❤️
I’m sad when he says “you get the first bite” only because when I go to take a bite, I can’t... then I cry because I can’t taste it... now I’m sad :(
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOUR INACTIVITYYYY
I just love the fact that you teach us how to cook AND then bless my ears😭
Eu e minha fome de 500 mendigos comíamos essa ai com gosto kkkkk
This lasagna looks so fresh. Props to you Zach! I’m subbing!♥️
Mukbang nasi goreeng....
That’s one a of the most satisfying video I’ve ever seen in my entire life 😨🙏🏼
Yessss
Zack since you made ratatouille you should make Beignets from the princess and the frog !
10:24 Cutting pieces with Monday Night Dinners moments
I'm from Brazil, I love this channel 😍❤
I can’t believe, how good, this lasagna looks. I am truly speechless by how damn good of a cook you are.
Because you have 11.1 million subscribers..       Can you post every 2 weeks or every week?
yo estoy asiendo dieta y estoy viendo esto XD
I haven’t had lasagna in so long!! now I want to some😋
What the fuck, was this filmed by National Geographic?
I have a question why do you post videos every month
This is art 🖼 😘
First bite is all yours
I love ur channel
😳😳😳😳😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛😛
Zach you should try a chicken alfredo lasagna. One of my favorites
That looks soo good 😲
this man would be the star of hells kitchen
Look very good 😭
O shiet
Me going into the comments to see where the begining begins
Zach you are one if the best mukbangers  in the world
Talk about a bottomless stomach I wish I had that big of a appetite
Eating like an Indian love from india
Ese whey come un chingo alaverga 😅(no es hate)soy de MEXICOOOO cabrones

_BRASIL ALGUÉM? 🇧🇷_

Why every single time he makes food I wish I could be there to eat it or at least cook like him
I CAN SMELL THE LASAGNA THROUGH THE SCREEN
Welcome back ❤️ hope you feel refreshed and that your mind block has passed
You should start your own cooking show! Gordon Ramsey is shook right now
Asu kabeh
Honestly, I love Lasagna😍
Reminds me of Ratatouille in the intro
The eggs remind me of Moso cooking utuber
I don’t kho if you are 30 you don’t look like a 30 year old you look like a 25 year old
Are you like 25 or 28
Im hungreh
That was so satisfying!
Please start cooking more and more
Man he's eating saludable
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD!!
Just make a cooking channel cause at this point everyone just focuses on the cooking portion instead of the eating
I've never been so jealous in my life xD
what toke you so long to make another video
Fucks garfield?
lasanha ?
watching you eat HAS BEEN THE GREATEST ACCOMPLISHMENT IN MY LIFE
Real question is how did he get that lasagne out without cutting it first?
No relaja da hambre
I enjoy seeing him cook rather than eat
Whats all the music used in this video?
Zach if you kept the thumbnail as the real lasagna rather than an edited one it would look better! The real lasagna looked amazing!
Who else wants them to do McDonald’s mukbangs again.
Why can’t other asmrist and muck bangers be like this
Woah this is like a five star restaurant mukbang channel now
I just want to eat.. don’t want to make😬
Let the rumbling of belly beging🙁!!!
Siempre me pregunte  Por qué no engorda :v
Meet the man who smiles with his eyes 😊
Zack: *Cooks* Me: **Heavily sweating**
I think zach's videos are the only videos I don't skip through 😐

Big mouth hah

Never forget the original intention！
I feel like this is the last time he posts for another month
Zach: fricken inhales the first bite Me: i wish my mouth was bigger
Honestly just come for the cooking
Anyone known places to eat delicious lasagna in nyc 😊
Spend this food better to people , many people have nothing on food or money for food , bullshit content
Zach Choi takes the saying: “eat until your full” way to seriously.
This is pretty cool...
🤍🥺
Are you sure this is ASMR?????
It’s lasagna :D
Quisiera saber preparar todo lo que cocinas
Wow! Surprisingly this food isn’t spicy
Zach Choi is impossible to hate
I’m gonna be sad when this guy passes away 😢

ABANDONOU

Zach, dude did you study Culinary Arts or something because the way you cook and the cooking techniques you use is truly out of this world! ♥️♥️♥️
I LOVE LASAGNA

No one: Zach: lemme make yall hungry asf at 2am
Zach’s first video of 2021, let’s make this a good year.
Povera lasagna...Italia perdona 🇮🇹😅

Готовишь потрясающе😍 ,но Боже ,эта деревянная вилка меня убивает 😒
My turkısh
This is so satisfaying to watch

I thought it was a cake in the thumbnail lol-
مافي عرب هون😄😄
Pog the king is back

I think nobody should ask why he has 11 million followers
That looks sooo good.
This looks sooo good
hey dude, where i can find ur recipes ? also continue like that ! ur work is insane !
How much often do you work out
Bro why the clickbait thumbnail? You shouldn’t need to do that.
4:28  The way the water was dripping from the tomato
What happened? Why didn't you post a video? we wondered about you
Zach is so amazing ❤️
Ever thought about how ground beef is called ground beef but ground turkey is called ground turkey, why can't ground beef just be called ground cow
imagine a hungry homeless person watching this. just imagine
So let's talk about the tomato without its skin🤔
I love lasagne with every fibre of my being, would eat that whole thing on my own with no hesitation
Zach in 10 years:      Fried chicken and waffles with Dwyane The Rock Johnson
Subscribe for good luck
*One day he will scream into the mic and we will all die*
Dude I completely forgotten that this was a mukbang...I thought it was a cooking show!
:>
Zach: Smiles while eating     Me: Are you laughing at me?
Okay I fell for the thumbnail
Is that herbs n oregano? 😀🤜
𝕎𝕙𝕠 𝕝𝕠𝕧𝕖𝕤 𝕒𝕤𝕞𝕣 𝑀𝑒!
Nice! If you had made Italian ragù it would be even more bomb 💣 also we use bechamel (besciamella) not ricotta, but this version looks great its a little lighter probably! 😋
nooooooooo la lasagna va con la besciamella
me eating fruit loops for dinner...
Oh my God!! You are amazing!! Well done!! Greetings from Greece!!!
I'm really starting to Adore these cooking intros
i need a boyfriend like zach so he can cook me anything LMAO
This Is   ...Read more
teacher: No food in class! kids at the back:
First byte at 10:35 🙂Thank me later 😁.. Yummyyy that looks bomb  🤤😋
I feel good when I think of Italians who will be happy
The video quality plus AirPod sound quality makes this so much better.
Best ASMR EVER!
NOW my ears are extremely happy
😡👎
This is the first time I see him struggling so hard to put the food in his mouth😂anyways, it looks absolutely mouthwatering-I shouldn't watch these kind of videos at 2am💀😂
The thing is he not just good at MUKBANG he is also an amazing chef
So satisfying  sound!
ASMR KING IS BACK!👑💎
Imagine that being on your plate when dinner is served
15:05  I love that smile on your face😄😁😊
Garfield join the chat..
I would pay for Zach to make this for me
Your back😝❤️😄😁
Zach la lasagna italiana, bravo nella preparazione👌👍👌👍👌👍
I have no words🤤🤤❤
You could low-key become a cook and earn money as well as become more famous DO IT 😂
I was listening to Welcome to the Panic Room and this randomly popped up.   And I was like, "why not?"
Your back yess
Wow your video is so satisfying 😍😍
i miss his fast food videos
Wow you are amazing. Absolutely the best asmrtist out there.
These videos are sooo good it is definitely worth the wait
Pahingi po 😢
CADA VEZ MEJORANDO, MÁS ME SORPRENDE la calidad de video!
100 years later of the last video
OH MY GOD IT LOOKS SO DELICIOUS
I love how he cooks the lasagne with so much love❤
Minecraft Villagers be like 11:51
Zach man no doubt your videos are next level of awesome but sometimes, I guess as the saying goes, perfection becomes procrastination. One or two videos in a month is just too less. I don't know whether you're doing it alone or you have a team but either way, I don't know how, but pls increase the frequency of videos.
when he tryed putting the whole piece in his mouth. SUCKING DAT bad boyyyy
i hate u
hey whaysup the badest asmr
How many fans joined Zach Choi ASMR today?
Do you own proper knives and forks?
A'so happy🌹❤
Man. Zach's video is like half commercial and Mukbang.  Literally better than like a Mcdonald's Commercial. 💯 😂
KEEP IT UP ZACH LOTS OF LOVE FROM PAKISTAN
Oh wow, that looks absolutely delicious! But there is one thing which is a mystery for me: HOW was he able to get this lasagne out of the container in like on entire piece without even cutting it? This is magical! 😄❤️
Mom: why are you eating your phone? Me:Zach Choi offered me the first bite😏
The king of eating asmrs is back
How it feels to be here before 1,000,000 views             😏😏😏
Everything from scratch. Great job 👌
Pov: You Are Eating And Watching This Vid Like If True
LETS GOOO!! WAITING FOR WEEKS FOR THIS VID. LOVE IT!!! :)
Lasagna looks really delicios👍👍
It's so good quality but he only eats for like 25% of the video
А че такая грустная музыка?
That is the most glorious lasagna I’ve ever seen
does he fast for like 2 days and then eat
Zach, i love your videos but please stop destroying the italian food!
Nice
you are eating very well
10:36 Zach big bites are legendary in the history of Asmr.😂
My mom: How did your screen crack?! Me: I dropped my ipad trying to take the first bite
garfield would loveeee  dis vid
It's 3 am and I'm torturing myself.
This is not only mukbang, this is ART!
I'm still waiting on his cookbook tho XD
I have been watining so long and now I fill like I’m in the movies
Woooow!!!! 💙💙💙💙💙
YES!!! I’ve been waiting for another ASMR
Any student here💜👇
Want to take me there to eat? I'm accepting
Bites are too big making it look sloppy :/
Мм Ⓜ понятно
Welcome back
Yes
How big do you want the lasagna?    Zach: Yes.
That...                                                                           Was beautiful 😢
This Is so perfect to be free
Zack, the man with no gag reflexes
Pog
Who used to have a crush on Zach choie
I ❤️ see him eat a want ti ask if you can eat sushi 🍱 🍣
10:20 it’s finally finished!!!
my dad makes the  lasagnaa
Without us realizing  To be a good and healthy asmrtists u must know cooking(optional), hygienic eating by that i mean if something is dripping wipe it and finally do a lot of exercises which require a lot of effort especially when a beginner in an asmr career who agrees tell me 😁
WELCOME Back😃😃😃
IM SOO EXITED
WOOOHOOO
It was the no sprite pour for me😔
Perfect way to end my day🙏🏾👍🏾
*perfectionist*
The big bites Make me anxious
I am 100% convinced that this guys has atleast 3 tape worms! its insane how much food he intakes for just one video..
Im curious if Zach gets sick after these videos or if he doesn't how does he stay thin.
his video is so professional tho
This guy eats a family dinner in 10 minutes... he must consider eating contests... really ;)
If he opened a restaurant, I would eat there every day
He is greattttt cheff
Hey Zach Happy New Year!!!
get yourself a guy who cooks his own food like zach.
Long time no see😁
Dear Zach:   The quality of your videos is amazing! with you i discovered that i like to see how food is prepared more than see the person eating it.   Since you started this new kind of videos preparing the food i just falled in love with your channel!  Please keep doing these videos and thanks for this!
We know you looked up “ nice Italian background music “ for your background .
I could never 💀
There's ALOT I love bout Zach. But I love he eats like he has sense
garfield sub
Sen yemek yeme kardeş güzel yiyemiyosun😑
E porca troia :|  quella non ha niente a che vedere con la lasagna italiana (voglio dire: è GIGANTESCA) Complimenti per aver cucinato.  Avrai seguito ricette italiane...perfetta. COMPLIMENTI
A positive clickbait
I'm italian and you made a great Lasagna! Good job 💪❤️
His videos are like movies. Love to watch them🔥
Wow the food was huge
Dudes got too much time on his hands
Shabli ghaysawbe chbakiya 😅
I know he is doing great asmr but why he upload videos so late this is rude 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
He's actually an amazing cook.
I would really love to see the behind the scenes or the making 🤓😊
_🇧🇷❤️_
I can tell that he's improved his sound quality, theres no more background noise
I love lasagna MMM 😋
.
some people go to museums to admire works of art. i just watch zach cooking in 4K
Zach is so amazing and I am watching his videos since last two years and the experience was fantastic
oh my God that looks so damn good give me some
Everyone: ahh, yet another awesome and satisfying video by the king Me: how-- how did he-- HE ATE OVER HALF OF THE THING
Quality of The highest...
Where the fu*k is the sprite?
Even the god damn eggs looks perfect.....
Finally, he’s back! <3
FINALLY AFTER NEARLY A MONTH
It looks good It sounds good  I want to make it But my hands and brain say no U-U
He backkkk

Please put the food in your mouth bit by bit... Look so gross when you eat like that...
Vedio start on 10:33 min
Any pubg player here😳😳🤗🤗🤗

I like when he smile..😍
I love youuuuuu aaaaa. You are the best
I get Ratatouille vibes if that makes sense!!❤️
YESSSS!!! HES BACKK!!!
He finally back at it again and he eating lasagna
I have a question? 🧐 Is it a human reflex to watch someone eating while you’re in bed starving?🤨
he eats so much fat and sugar, yet clear skin and no weight gain
And the editing award goes to zach
Can we please give Zach Choi his own Food Channel. This guy is very authentic and amazing!
His intrros are like a disney movie trailer
Irate that lasagna 10/10 perfect!
🖕👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
This food looks a jungle to me
Jane asmr vs zackchoi 🥶
Wow perfect 👌
Armyyyy love you ❤️❤️❤️
Wow its just amazing💐🌿🌿
Where have u been
We need an orange cat now.
This is like watching Dexter meets Master Chef. The black gloves remind me of a serial killer, but the lasagna looks delish. But seriously, what is with the size of it? I've never seen a lasagna quite like it. I can't believe how much of it you actually ate.
When your mom says Close your mouth and eat 👁👄👁
2020: Zach choi eating fast food and food from restuarants  2021: BANG  ASMR LASAGNA  and how to make it
It's midnight and I'm soooo hungry. 🤤 Good thing I have a bottle of water near me. Pfft.
Zach be regular plz
People in the comments: Congratulating and complimenting Zach's work on the video Meanwhile me wondering how he is managing to eat all of that lasagna🤔
This is another level of asmr, 😭I'm so proud (I'm not crazy)
why do you rarely upload videos
Finally the worlds best Mukbanger has arrived
Yo you should change the channel name into “Zach Choi’s Eating and Cooking Show”
very  nice .love from pakistan
is he making the video alone?or he has a crew?
I’m dying to found out your metabolic rate
I love the videos and the quality of the videos. I just don’t see why he stuff his mouth so much.
This was excellent u can still bring back fast foods if ur ever out of ideas👍
Sooo that’s why you weren’t posting for weeks
the beginning is like a professional cooking show with its slo-mo shots and the fancy background music
For this reason he have 11M of suscribers
Not gonna lie...just kidding i just lied
HI chef
is it me or am I missing your juice
he never widens his mouth lol
This really has turned into Zacks cooking show
Man do U even take off ur hat
Love you احبك
You can see the join on his face 15:43

So satisfying and calming to watch. I love it
Bruh it looks like a movie
Why is he barely uploading anymore?
Guys Trust Me!! ZACH MAKES MORE DELICIOUS FOOD THAN HIS GF.
YOURE SO GOOD AT TAKING THE YOLK OUT OF THE WHITE STUFF  (idk what its called also sorry dirty minded people T-T)
imagine doing all this and not even have something to watch with it

Me during the video: 👁️ 👄 👁️
Eating is short but the cinematic and intro is fireee
Your whole preparation of this dish was great and I enjoyed watching the whole process!! Your lasagna looks so good!!
Fighting zach

perhpas this is why Zach posts a vid at night....
I love how Zach is improving his work and presentation but for some odd reason I prefered his old style better. Dont get me wrong, this video is beautiful, but I feel like I shouldnt be watching this because this food looks like its been made for the Queen of England and not a peasant like me 🍜
there is zach choi and then there is nicocado avacado
Ramsay I KNOW U R WATCHING THIS ....DONT  CHU B HIDING... LEAVE A COMMENT!
This guy is not fun anymore.Everything looks like a food commercial ad. No more fakes!
10:30 is eating time

The green makes the lasagna look nice
In our family that would be enough for 6 people lol
🐳You can tune a guitar, but you can’t tuna fish, unless of course you play bass🐳 Delicious Mukbang my talented friend!! See you tomorrow..Love Always~ Mukbang Mermaid💙
Zach choi meals are always mouth wateringg
i literally just had lasagna for dinner yesterday and he uploads this
4:43 -  *Apple*
*The dislikers must be those guys who knows that their girlfriends are crushing on Zach. 🤣*
Long time no see Zach choi sir 🤧
Let me guess  - ur in bed  - starving - and looking in the comments
I’m Italian ❤️👁👄👁
Camera quality was so good I saw the molecules holding together the food. nice job
Why dont u ppl eat veg 😂😂😂
This is not ASMR This is not Mukbang This is *making me hungry*
You forgot to put the BESCIAMELLA🙃 in the lasagne you don’t have to put mozzarella. The Parmesan is optional🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
Nobody: What is your favourite drink? Me(without thinking):Sprite!!
Finally you made a new video.. I was waiting to see the perfect cooking ASMR..🤩🤩
Long time no see, my friend :)
Were Is the soda
오 형 살아있었군아

Amazing!
So satisfying!
Por que duras tanto sin subir videos
Yuck
Yes Finley you here
He didn't come to play today.  Epic prep footage.  Awesome video.
@10:51 Zach went "OhHhHh Yeahhhh!!" ❤️🤤🤤🤤🤤 I absolutely love that he NEVER rushes things, every shot is filmed exceptionally. Makes every action, so much more satisfying. Also, love the slow background music. 😍
Putting one lasagna on top of another lasagna is still one lasagna.
you know its a good day when zack posts
Indo ada kah?
Did you starve yourself just to eat this
Can I have piece?
I think this is the first time that he didn't finish a meal in full
Цаааааааа❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🔮🔮🔮🔮
I'll be making this for my parents some day :)
Wow!!! This whole video is AWESOME and that Lasagna 🤤 looks sooooooooooo good!!! 😋 Glad to see you back!!!

Wow. .I love to watch you cook and eat but do you have to take such giant bites? I'm scared you're gonna choke lol
Your amazing the quality is perfect you are perfect i just want you to post more bideos cause i get bored of other mukbangers
Friend : ooh it’s a clickbait !! What a bad asmr artist !!  Me : so you have chosen death
It's far more delicious eating your own cooked foods tbh. No wonder he's enjoying himself
This is the first mukbang video that i ever saw that they make the lasagna correctly. Everything is perfect! Respect from an italian bro! <3
Yes the thumbnail. :)
only real fans used to remember him wearing ear buds
I love that wooden fork
Stop the hate he is a good eater like you he don’t likeSmack
If you're hungry after watching this video put your hands up

ليش عم أطول بتنزيل الفيديوهات أن شاء الله تفهم علي
But..where is the Sprite..😁😁❤️❤️
There’s also breakfast langsa
My grandma would be proud of you

Loving the AP
It's about time he made Lasagne 💯
yaaaaaaaay our chief is back yaya
The quality's too great that I'm starting to doubt if we're actually allowed to watch this for free
I don’t even like lasagna yet I want to eat it now cuz this man makes everything look delicious   *chef kiss*
Hi
watching you cook the food makes the lasagna look even more deliciouss
i think he’s starving the whole day and than when he made his food he eats a whole lasagna
Oh why is nobody talking about how they feel or they are on bed with no food like usual-
Use me as a “Dang bro, I’m hungry 🤤 “ button
Judges: “Who smiles only with their eyes?” Zach: “Let me introduce myself.”
I miss the days when zach uploaded almost daily.
Looks yummy but entirely to many steps just to make
Dude, go work for Gordon Ramsay
our best one mukbang youtuber is here~
his vein 🥵
به نظر خوشمزه میومد
OUR KING IS BACK!!!!
"The first bite is all yours" All I have is a bolied egg right now please 😭
He's always trying to make his vids perfect that's why his hands shake when he's about to eat cuz the food might fell. (my opinion) no offense
happy italian noises
i think you should do a collab with tyuzang 😊
yes yes yes
T 'm turkey🙈🙈
JESS
Can we get a moment of Silence for Zach's Excersise machines?
PIZZA PASTA MANDOLINO. love from italy :)

Garfield is one of the people that liked this XD aka me lasagna  is my favorite type of pasta based dish next to alfredo I'm so jealous now I want lasagna!
Alguém do Brasil 😂

And now we wait a month for another MasterPiece 🔅
You're ridiculous putting that much food in your mouth, unnecessary
The quality of the video was so good that I didn't even have to raise it🤣🤣🤣🤣✌✌👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽

Lub uuuuu❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
It looks very yummy, good job Zach!
Zach should open a restaurant now. He's a professional chef.
This moment when you have a fork and you use it like a spoon xD
1:46 that veins😚
Zack - *Makes lasagna * Me - 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Please do chocolate or Sushi
*Zach getting fat*
He aint gonna finish that
this is what a quarter Garfield’s watch history probably looks like
*Who else is a part of the notification squad?* 👇🏻🎅💜
Thus came out at midnight where I’m from and I woke up just for him
Why you zach dont open the restoran
Perfect lasagna I'm Italian
Parsley looks much more vivid than before. Great video.
Damn, that lasagna bigger than his head.
Satisfaction guaranteed
I loved that so much half the I was licking the screen
A question/   Why are you handsome
Cinema Quality
The return of the King!!
:0
My saliva is leaking when i watching this🤤
Me: I don’t like lasagna  Also me: Bites into screen
Oh no ajm hungry
Здесь есть русские?
I think.. I think I wanna be a chef when I grow up
Ewww this is more like a food challenge
It's pretty, but you forgot a lot of things for the ragu : carrot, celery, shallot.  The meat is traditionally composed of beef and pork, and between each layer of pasta you have to put a béchamel and parmesan and/or pecorino.  there is no mozzarella or ricotta in it.  It's still appetizing, but it's not really lasagna
HEY ZACH CHOI CAN YOU MAKE BEHIND THE SCENES OF YOUR DOING YOUR VIDEO?❤ YOUR CONTENT IS LIT MAN I WANT YOU TO MAKE BEHIND THE SCENES! 🔥 ❤
Big talent, big stomach! Haha

Já estava sentindo falta

Intro: 0:01 Cooking: 0:11 Eating: 10:22 Ending: 17:49

I still remember a small ASMR channel with a man wearing yellow shirt and a cap in his DP, commenting in videos of every  famous Mukbangers and ASMRtists. Now has made 11.1 million subscribers. A good example of diligence👍
I like that he teaches us how to make it when he’s cooking and food looks so yummy! and he’s always so happy whiles makes the asmr and eating

🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝
Yayyyyyy he is back i had been waiting  And why do i feel like i smell this rn,😳
zach never fails to make us feel hungry
Omg. 2 words : I'M HUNGRY
This is a masterpiece.
Zach Choi = best boi
Thats too much food to eat in an entire week let alone one sitting.
I literally drop my jaw when he took the first bite.
I am italian and this lasagna Is perfect
How you finish all this howww
damn I would've been full after taking his 2 bites
🤤🍝
SARAP YARN
Let's be real. Hes hands down one of the best Asmr-ists out there.
i want to marry this man😍
He should have a restaruant and restaurant's name is (First bite is all yours)
videos come early
He is A cooker more than a eater😜
Looks so yummy 😍😍
my tummy would beat me into a pulp if continue watching this😅😅
Just a few nitpicks -pour the sauce onto the meat and scrape up at that delicious fond. -you wait for the water boil and then heavily salt it, it takes less time to boil. -butter and oil instead of just oil when frying onions and crap. -olive oil, eggs+egg yolks, and a splash of water would make that pasta just a bit better.
me: why am I even watching this, i know i dont know have this type of food.....
I legit had a heart attack thinking you were about to eat that whole lasagna. You are speaking to my corpse. I died of relief.
Yes he's back
Yes guess who back again Zach Choi 🥳🥳🥳
Fuck yeah
Reeweewee
why seldom upload Vidio? even though I'm looking forward to it:

Zach: “first bite is yours” Me: *opens mouth*  My mom: *opens the door* “what are you doing “ 👁👄👁 Me: nothing, absolutely nothing 👁👄👁
Thank you king

the amount of dedication he puts into making his food is beautiful
Lasanha made in brasil
O REI VOLTOU!!!🙈🙈🙈
Finally
Zach: rolling the dough Me: Now I see how he's so muscular😀
I want some 😫
That SLURP at 15:04 ......
Zach: cooks an entire lasagna from scratch  Me: struggles to make microwavable noodles
It looks so delicious. What a beautiful presentation. Please though, the stuffing of one's mouth while eating is so unnecessary done. Thank you Zach for such beautiful videos❤
When the sad music came in I got emotional 🤧💜
Again, my stomach is suffering
Let me gues..  [Your in bed] [Starving] [And reading the comments]
Next you should eat schnitzel
This is the definition of home grown.
You thought I would be hungry? Haha, I have waffle french toast with me : )

King ASMR:ZACH Kiny Mukbang :Tanboy kun
One of my favourite meals! I took great pleasure watching and listening. Good job!
Tá sumido
the bottle openning got me goosebumps
Zach's content always never disappoints
🤤Hahhhah my heart hungry 🤤
SWhat I want to know is how to do it so as not to get fat, it eats a lot of fat and does not get fat, I eat a pizza and I eat like 10 kilos
Garfield's favorite food

I wish he post often like if u think so too

Si ya te extrañabaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Best ASMR PERSON EVER I LOVE HOW YOU COOK AND JUST PREPARE YOUR MEAL I LOVE WATCHING YOU EAT AS WELL BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MANY MANNERS YOU EAT WITH YOUR MOUTH CLOSED YOUR CLEAN AND YOU ALWAYS EAT WITH A KNIFE AND FORK P.S. BIGGEST LASAGNA EVER.
like,, bro no one's doing it like zach choi. the quality of the asmr and even the calming bgm. to add, the camera works are awesome.
the filming and the cooking process of the food makes it look so amazing! like commercial perfect food
you mad lad
🤣when I heard the wine being opened it sounded like someone moaning..I’m sorry I had too🤣
So Sprit still didn’t advertise you? .-.
the quality of this asmr is at the highest. just listening while the dough gets flattened is already soothing enough. the satisfaction i got by watching is 10 out of 10.
My mouth is watering so bad.
Dunno why....but I was trying to urge him to spank the dough at 2:22. Just...Choi just spank it. C'mon dude, spank the dough!  😞 He don't spank the dough...
My face when I saw the completed lasagna "😳"
The quality of Vidio so God damn good
Amazing it's so satisfying the videos you make congratulations on the diamond play button.
Is it sad i've binged all his videos?
Yes Tha king ls Back♥♥♥♥♥

Gosh, I’m craving lasagna now
10:30 *Wait, he's not gonna put all that in his mouth... omg he just did...*
Is that a fucking lasagna   “Yes”  “Oh”
I can’t stop binge watching these videos
When he peels the tomato it reminded me of a demogorgon. Been rewatching stranger things lmao.
Finally 😤
This man should be on master chef lol
This is the only ASMR I watch/listen to, AND IT'S FAWKING DELIGHTFUL. It's sinful, almost.
Wow great video ❤️

i swear the whole cooking took so long that it became like a long dictionary.
me and my braces could never
Damn I make lasagna the lazy way with boxed noodles and I feel like it’s a lot of work and he’s out here making his own noodles and ground beef 👏🏼
I prefer chicken and cheese videos or corn dog videos
Happy new Year King 👑
The cooking aspect is your real talent.
Ураааа

The cooking looks like a commercial 😳
Yes i love Zack Choi asmr 🤗💕

The fact that he did not buy store-bought pasta?!? And made his own sauce, i'm just waiting for him to start his own farm to get his own vegetables and flour 😆
Yess I’ve been waiting
Hi
Please upload as soon as possible 🙏😊
Zack the king of asmr
Yah
the beginning of the video felt like i was watching anime
Who all are watching this sitting in your bed before going to sleep 😁😁😪
Everyone's gonna be jealous of Zach's kid in the future 😅...... He or she gonna have the best lunches 😂
Damn thats yummy
*I hope he still notices a fan though he's too popular now but he isn't noticing now*
Finallyyyyy
Miss the smile and the eating sound and also the cooking 😁😁😁
Man puts so much effort to make his cooking part and i skip the whole part just to see his eating part😂
For the fact that I don’t read comments on these cause there are always like beggars!   Like I don’t get it!  (I know it sounds like I want likes but I actually don’t)
why am I crying
So satisfying!!!! He’s the best at ASMR!!!
Honestly the food looks bigger than him at that angle 🤣🤣🤣
The only one on Earth who smile while eating.
Finally
The people who disliked are the ones who starved and got jealous
Bruh😂
Cooking videos be a whole movie
Finally,my lunch will be legendary
its amazing how refined Zachs cooking is - then he eats like a savage lol
I like how Zach makes almost everything he eats from scratch.

I WAS JUST WATCHING YOU!
Congrats on 11 mil
Todo lo que entra sale 😳 pobre culo compa
Ayeeee the kingggg Choi
I feel like the asmr is too short and there is too much cooking. I enjoy your recipes and cooking clips but it's too long. This is an asmr channel not a cooking channel. No hate, just stating my opinion
I feel bad for this man. He eats for his viewers
Just eat McDonald’s again I miss that pls
This is giving huge "Get me the lasaggna" vibes
Aquí esta el comentario en Español que buscabas... Este buen hombre siempre me sorprende con sus videos y también como le cabe tanta comida en la boca y en el estomago... un saludo desde México.
Quan tran would have KARATE CHOP it into 4 pices
I want the recipe for this 😅
Yummy 😋🤤
You can tell he’s so proud and how good it tastes
늦어서 미안 1
I was preparing to go to sleep because I have school tomorrow but when I saw the notification of this video, I got a smile from my face because the KING IS BACK!!!!!🔥🔥❤
Why am I watching this late at night, in bed, hungry af.. Probably not a good idea
How will he eat the whole   BTW : can you give me the half
He should cook 👨‍🍳 on masterchief

The beginning of the vids look like the ads I see on the TV screens at Walmart good quality 🔥💯
Zach Choi's videos are so calming and satisfying. The most video I love in his channel is the chicken nugget and spicy noodles video. It's literally the best combo ever! And I loved this one because of the presantation, the looks and oh! It's just so pretty ✨✌️

it's so satisfying to watch❤
enjoy it, stop forcing it into your mouth
YEES ZACH IS BACKKKK!!!!
Zach..can I have a bite from that lagasa..???🤤
Do you starve your self before you make a video
Day 1 of trying to get pinned by zach
Next level: *exists* Zach Choi: *went even higher*
Zach: first bite is all yours Me: yeah it taste like CO combine with O2 with a little taste of dust
me; eats* later: IM TAKEING A PRIVATE BATHROOM
Amaging
Judges: “Who eats a lot but doesn’t get fat?” Zach: “Let me introduce myself.” Nikocado Avocado: “I’m the opposite.”
THE QUALITY THO!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not gonna Lie, This guy always makes me crave, *Sniffle
I’m Italian and even I don’t make my lasagna that intensely from scratch. 😳 I make the sauce from scratch but I buy the pasta and ground meat from the store. This is next level.
wow 17 minutes ago
Garfield: 👁 👄 👁
IM ADDICTED
03:18 in the morning, I'm the only one awake in the house And I'm torturing myself by looking at food           I'm hungry now
Ayyy Zack Choi is my favourite Mukbanger!
Making the lasagna was the most beautifully-satisfying-relaxing food prep I have ever seen. Zach's a legend 👑❤️
Yes he is back
ok\
😮 Amazing 😋
영상 1주일에 3번올리자
Absolute perfection 👌 😍 ❤

This is one THICC lasanga dish.

No one: ... Me: *looks for my headphones* My mom: What u looking for? Me: Oh, I'm looking for headphones. Zach told me to wear them!
THE BEST KING OF THE ASMR! IS ZACH CHOI ASMR!

Zach choi may be hungry...   But    He will never be the fat
This is the most worth it wait that I ever had in my time in YouTube.
CONGRATULATIONS ON 11 MILLION!!!
No offense, but some of those big ass bites these mukbangers take in makes me wonder how on Earth they don't choke on it. The food looks amazing but I would have to take baby bites compared to them lol
Por cuánto tiempo no comerá para poder terminarse todo eso jaja xD
Can you do a spicy noodle meal please!
Nickado avocado:)
yes 🙌 i love it 🥰
yep
😻😻😻
How cool would it be if Zach pinned your comment. 😆
Garfield is mad now!
God was like: Mint Zach was like: NOPE
Do you keep the mic in your mouth because there is no way there is this much sound
So glad you back!!! Thanks for taking time to prepare your meals❤️❤️❤️
It’s 1am and I’m drooling, thirsty hungry with no water and not food 🥲
*I wish zach can adopt me so that when I ask to eat out, he'll say "we have food at home"*
