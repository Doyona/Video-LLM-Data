Hey d u should come to an Elgin football game this year it’s in Ohio that would make my year.
Yessir Alabama

Have a great day God love y’all
it's a highschool game and the coach is acting like this is the NFL.  who cares if he's on the sideline as long as he's not interfering with the players duties what's the problem?  i can understand if he's talking to the players and distracting them when they need to be on the field or something.  but if he's not interfering the coach is just being an a-hole.
Nooooooo!!!

Plant City overall has always had poor athletic directors and coaches. Too many egos and feeling like they’re more important than the school or team they represent. Appreciate what you do for these kids keep going 🤙🏽

I think you’d get better support if your videos didnt show you getting involved with the players on the sidelines while the coaches are trying to coach. Why do you think espn and other media is openly allowed on the sidelines? Cause they just film (without interacting) and showcase the kids. You make the videos about you not the kids
Have Mario play against lamar Patterson.  That would be a banger
You guys ever wonder if this man smokes a fat blunt before every game? And is like "oh great, another trash football game I have to over hype"
When Mario scored his second TD, that same play the ref just in the middle of the whole play like move 🤣
I know it’s a way to come, but try to get up to south Lyon Michigan. We got a team I’ll tell you that plus I’m the kicker and maybe we can go kicking together one day. My longest is 55 so I’m no joke.

This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!! 🙏💝😄

PLEASE TAKE THE TIME TO READ THIS. IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK 'READ MORE')  There are some things that you should know:  1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:  Ro 3:23 "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;"  Ro 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"  It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.  2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:  Ro 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."  Ro 5:8 "But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."  Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It's the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That’s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won't go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won’t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.  3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).  Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.   Heb 9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.  You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him.   Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.  Ro 10:9,10;13 "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."  4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:  ”Dear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, placing my Faith and Trust in You as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.”  If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.  Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism..
GOD LOVES YOU ALL!!!!

In fact, he prohibited the Muslims to even pray in their houses and took Allah’s Book the grand Quran and burned Allah’s Book the grand Quran as transgression and oppression.       You must listen and comprehend what will I say it with Truth: O you the Chinese president Xi Jinping, I swear by Allah the Great, surely you will open houses of Allah while you are of the humiliated-trifle ones also the entire those who wronged themselves that shut-down Allah’s houses (of worship) with the pretense of prevention they will definitely open it and to it they will escape, and we surely truthful, and you surely will know.

#The_only_solution_for_coronavirus_is_here 👇👇  Quotation from The awaited imam mahdi's (Nasser Mohammed Al- yemeni) statement:👇   it is for you to know with certainty that the disease of the suffocating torment of Allah that you call ‘corona virus’ will not be removed from you except by Allah only. So let the people repent from the worst of sins, the gross indecencies, the injustice to the people, and from the injustice of associating partners [with Allah]. And say: “Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers.”  And after the repentance let each one of them say: “O Allah I am Your servant, I ask you by virtue of the fact that there is no God but You, and by virtue of the fact of Your Mercy which you have decreed upon Yourself, and by the virtue of the fact of the greatness of Your Pleasure within, which is greater than the pleasure of your heaven, to cure me of the torment of Corona or to turn it away from me as I am a believer in the caller to the truth from You.  O Allah, remove Your torment from us from whichever direction it comes from, so that we follow the path of the truth from You. And strengthen us to fulfil what we have promised you, O you who intervene between a man and his heart, as we only have Your mercy, You have decreed upon Yourself. If You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers. O Allah You have said in the clear verses of Your book {And your Lord says, “Call upon Me; I will respond to you.} [Shurah: 40 - Ghafir - Verse: 60] So the Dua'a (supplication) and the repentance is from me, and the response is from You and You do not break Your promise. Exalted You are our Lord, your promise is true and you are the Most Merciful. O Allah give us the strength to fulfil what we have promised You to follow the global caller to Allah, the caliph of Allah on Earth the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani. O Allah, make the raising of him a blessing upon us and not a misery upon us because of our turning away from the call to the truth of the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yemeni”.  And whoever refuses this supplication surely the torment of the so-called Coronavirus will befall them. And did Allah make the sign of the Corona virus but a sign of confirmation to the challenge in the statement of the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yemeni that was written on the 10th Rajab [5th March], titled “Corona virus is of the lesser torment short of the greater torment, that perhaps they may repent”?  End of the qoutation of statement for Imam Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani  At: 19 - 05 - 2020 AD  Its title is:  Corona Virus And The Decisive Statement That Is Not To Be Taken for Amusement  The full statement in this link👇 https://www.mahdialumma.com/showthread.php?t=40184    These statements which written by the Awaited Imam Mahdi (Nasser Mohammed Al-Yemeni ) read it to know the fact of coronavirus and the only solution for it  1) From The Caliph Of Allah Over The Worlds To Xi Jinping The President Of China 22 - 05 - 2020 AD 👇👇 https://www.mahdialumma.com/showthread.php?t=40329   2) Corona Virus And The Decisive Statement That Is Not To Be Taken for Amusement 19 - 05 - 2020 AD  👇👇 https://www.mahdialumma.com/showthread.php?t=40184    3) Corona virus is of the lesser torment short of the greater torment, that perhaps they may repent 05 - 03 - 2020  👇👇 https://www.mahdialumma.com/showthread.php?t=39469

JESUS IS COMING  & HE LOVES YOU  Believe the Gospel and Repent ⬇️⬇️⬇️  “Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin   THIS WORLD IS FULL OF SIN JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY !!! JESUS is COMING BELIEVE AND AND ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR TRUST IN HIM TODAY GOD LOVES YOU SO MUCH JUST COME BACK HOME AND LOVE HIM BACK  DENY YOURSELF DAILY AND TURN FROM SIN DAILY         #christian #jesus #faith #love #god #bible  #christ #church #christianity #fairtrade #gospel #hope #blessed #jesuschrist #truth #handmade #prayer #pray #scripture #life #holyspirit #worship #peace #godisgood #inspiration #religion #bibleverse #encouragement #motivation #goodnews

ESPN has a contract to be able to go out there and film. That contract includes a waiver that has to be signed by the players. You are just some random dude filming children. YEAH. You need to get permission REGARDLESS of the fact that you are doing so to promote them. Privacy laws ARE a thing and filming children without permission is illegal in nearly every state. Get over yourself. Laws exist for a reason.

80% lame commentary and being butthurt that you have to following the school rules 20% actual highlights
Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the Blood of Jesus Christ? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Christ said, "Come to Me as you are." It's not about not sinning, it's about having faith that Jesus lived the perfect life we couldn't and you're given eternal life. On the cross Jesus said, "It is FINISHED!" The Blood of Christ IS enough! God wants to give you salvation from damnation, all you have to do is have faith in what Christ has done for us. https://youtu.be/A159GcAffpI (He also has a Spanish version.)
Stfu and start the video

When there is discontent, is that discontent per sey or are you discontented with something? It is not the discontent, which has no cause and therefore can be ended. The moment there is a measure there must be discontent.

Alabama getting so many five star recruits is what’s wrong with College football. It’s killing it. It’s like an NFL team getting all first round picks in draft. Let that sink in
“After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his splendor. With a mighty voice he shouted: “ ‘Fallen! Fallen is Babylon the Great!’ She has become a dwelling for demons and a haunt for every impure spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, a haunt for every unclean and detestable animal. For all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries. The kings of the earth committed adultery with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries.” Then I heard another voice from heaven say: “ ‘Come out of her, my people,’ so that you will not share in her sins, so that you will not receive any of her plagues; for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.” #LordJesusiscoming

Hey ❤️I hope you’re having a great day.  Hopefully this comment gives you hope. The state of the world is alarming. Many people feel uneasy about everything that’s going on. The root of every single problem is evil aka sin. Any of us could die any second but where would we go after? Well, because of our sin and evil ways, we deserve to go to hell. The Bible states in Romans 6:23 “For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” BUT WAIT! I have some good news for you. God has offered us a chance to go to heaven and have everlasting life by sending his only Son Jesus Christ into the world to die on the cross for our sins. John 3:16 says “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” That was a true display of love. Repent and Surrender your life to Christ today before it’s too late.

This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Invite the Holy Spirit into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!! 🙏💝💐😊

I’m sure you’ve heard of software tools designed to help you build websites, sales pages and online funnels.

Take a closer look at it yourself, and pick up your free account while you’re there:    Let me know what you think.  To your success,  David Montoya  P.S. Mike told me that he is making some huge upgrades to his tools over the next several days, and we’re not sure if this will continue to be free for long. However, if you get your account right now, you’ll still be able to keep your account for life, including all the future updates to the tools.

Olá tudo bom? Meu nome é Gabriel e eu treino pra joga futebol americano nos EUA no High School, mas confesso que está um pouco difícil, por isso se você pudesse curtir as minha últimas publicações elas ficariam mais bem vistas e me ajudaria para que alguém treinador a note e isso me ajudaria na admissão em algumas escolas. Então se você puder fazer isso eu agradeço de todo o coração, e você que não pode eu também agradeço, e espero que Deus abençoe vocês e que vocês assim como eu corram atrás de seus sonhos e quero que todos eles se realizem. Abraço e fiquem com Deus. 🙏🙏🙏🇧🇷

LIFEBOAT DEBACLE Every now and then I think about the ‘lifeboat debacle’. The survivors of the Titanic sinking tragedy who were fortunate enough to get into a lifeboat, had to beat off the others in the water who wanted to get in! Why? That’s wicked, you say! Because if any more came into the boat it would sink. Those in the water didn’t care (drowning man syndrome) and those in the boats stifled their consciences (survivors instinct). JESUS is like a lifeboat in this cesspool of sin world we swim in. However there is always room for more because this lifeboat can’t sink (He can’t fail!) and leads to salvation. Are you drowning, cold, suffering? Come on in and be among the safe.

Dear precious one, cast ALL of your anxieties unto The Lord for He truly cares for you. Father God wants us to be real as we talk with Him and open up about our deepest concerns, fears, and struggles. He is not surprised by anything we mention. His interest in us is like the attention we would receive from a close friend. That’s why we’re encouraged to give all of our worries and cares to God—because He cares for us (1 Peter 5:7).                                   Don't ever be afraid to share all of your thoughts and feelings with our Lord Jesus, for He already knows what is on your mind and in your heart. There is NOTHING you can say that will shock Him for He created you and knew you BEFORE the foundation of this earth. His love is eternal, unconditional and just for you. Acknowledge that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Abba Yahweh (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) into your life.                                     Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is Lord and Savior of your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection for the sins of all mankind. You will then be justified in salvation and forever blessed with His abundant love by the Holy Spirit!                                                                         Let us pray!....Dear Father God, You know what’s on my mind today. Help me to experience the peace that comes from sharing all of my concerns with You. This I pray in the Mighty name of Your Son Yeshua (Jesus), Amen! May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.❤️❤️❤️
3 trending you got to keep posting no 🧢
Y’all lucky we can’t even play in my state till spring and that’s a maybe
First of all that ref is drunk asf
get saved in christ right now before it's to late. just pray that you believe he died for your sins and that he is your Lord and savior then tell him to enter your life. when you say this that dead spirit in you comes alive, your born again, soul is saved from hell, name written in the book of life. after that get to know god. repent and trust in God. serve god, you will be rewarded.

How to be a big youtuber: 1. Make videos 2. Become better 3. Gain followers 4. at one point when you have a big income tell them that you dont want to make just vids that vids are out, tell them you want more quality content but less videos. (translated: i want to make less videos but i want to have the same income).... 5. like every youtuber.....becoming lazy to work for the money amd hope you can live the dream of live.

5:45 my man turn into a cat 😭
13:35 watch the right receiver. What is this ref doing
Ok.... ok...c'mon.   I watched that lineman jump on the wrong ball several times.  It was classic.  I could not stop laughing.   Until you commented on it I was confused myself as to what the heck was going on. Who the heck through the 2nd ball onto the field?  ..... and..... u r damn right.  Give me a press badge from any news agency  and the coaches would probably let me film them in their locker room.  Lame.  U dropped a great point.
Are you stilling doing that YouNow thing?
Itd be cool to see you visit an 8 man football gamr
