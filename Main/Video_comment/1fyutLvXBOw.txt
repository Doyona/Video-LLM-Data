I'm not downplaying 2D "indie" games... but just letting this out here... Almost 4 years to the day from Sott making this video, a 2D indie game came out. Many AA and AAA games(there is no such thing as a AAAA game, just developers that think too much of themselves) held off releasing in the same time frame as it. Major Developers, afraid of an indie title. And that indie title, Hollow Knight: Silksong, still only cost $20. So, even only 4 years of inflation, major companies were scared of a 2D game selling for the same "indie" Price Tag half a decade later(making the actual comparative price lower).  Luckily, Silksong burned out as a ",5 hour game", and those "pee-pee-scared" devs released their games, showing a weird Extraction Shooter about maybe not killing the other humans was 1000×fold better than "CoD:BRAINROT Edition"
18:26 which is a little sad when you think about it
Dad pay attention. So relatable lol
Lincoln is died
I believe Kirby stayed 2(.5)D because Hal Labs recognized, correctly, that a full 3D Kirby game AT THE TIME would have been a disaster. Kirby didn't stay 2(.5)D as long as he did out of an aversion to it, he stayed that way because making a full 3D Kirby game turned out to be really hard. There's a reason they scrapped the concept when they tried to do it for GameCube.
14:49 Scott: "Great animation" Wario: shakin dat thang Scott: 🥵🥵
2D and 2,5D games have snappier gameplay and more broad FOV. 3D games tend to be more realistic with more rigid gameplay except that their FOV isnt that wide as it is in our real-life vision which can create feelings of claustrophobia and motion sickness if you arent used to them. Also , 3D games tend to have worse performance than 2D since they are much more dependent on your screen's size , aspect ratio, resolution and pixel density and also your hardware which can create inconsistencies during gameplay unlike 2D and 2,5D games which have extremely consistent performance and arent that dependant on your display and hardware characteristics.
0:05 This part always made me laugh! 😂
im taking a shot every time he says the letter D
2:18 STUNT RACE FX MENTIONED‼‼🗣🗣🗣
I'm sorry if I sound like a nerd but GTA got GTA advance so it did get a 2d entry but it was on the GBA so I guess it doesn't really count
12:50
4D Miner is the only 4D game I can think of
16:18 And another 2D game, and another, and another, and another, and another
You keep mentioning how indie games used to be mocked for not being AAA. Funny how the most sold video game out there right now was an indie game originally developed by one Persson.
Does Octopath Traveler count as a 2D game?
The repeated featuring of Metroid footage here is kind of ironic considering that... officially, Metroid Prime is a side story and Metroid Fusion, the GBA title, was the next *mainline* game that drastically altered the status quo.  'Course, even knowing that, it does still *feel* like Prime was considered the big title (or titleS) whereas Fusion was just "Oh yeah, GBA owners, here's a Metroid for you too I guess."
2D limitations was mostly in consoles. They were made in past to have certain look: Pixelated, colorful 2D.  Normal computer games were not that limited.
My take is, if a product is cheaper to produce, it should probably be cheaper for the consumer as well. Imo having a standard price in the first place is a little odd- but then again high budget games would start costing like $100, wouldn't they?  Supply and demand, I guess. 2D games have more appeal, sure, but I'd be surprised if grandma wants to pay $70 for one
Hi scott! I'd love to see a video on reggie or the game console generations!
Wario Land SHAKE IT had one of the coolest advertising campaigns ever. An early Youtube video that would destroy the website during the video!
10:08 CASTLE CRASHERS MENTION
5:11 both… It’s RUM-p
i always thought it was confusing to use 2D/3D to refer to gameplay style and it'd make more sense to use 2D/3D when talking graphics and sidescroller/freeroam when talking gameplay. "3D sidescroller" is a lot more effective as describing a game like super mario bros wii rather than "2.5D"
jumping flash came out in 1995
Metroid dread is one of my favorite games of all time if Nintendo makes a new one I would still buy it even if it was 70
Video game pricing and consumer good pricing in general tends to follow the same pattern, you want to price it as low as possible to capture as much of the market share as possible so 2D games are being sold for less because that's feasible while still making a profit.
You know the ps1 came out before the n64 right lmao
14:41 It unironically is offensive in Arabic, "it" means "dog" in Arabic which is used as an insult in many middle eastern countries
what is the video game at 2:37?
The Tomba/Tombi boss music after the mention of 2D PS1 games is everything!!
Paper Mario is 2.5 D as none of the characters (except for the fake bowser and general guys tank)
That is unless it’s Yoshi’s story. And paper Mario and Kirby 64 I guess
“Ps2 era” shows ps1
That intro happened at the worst time for me to be taking a sip of coffee
Mario when you could go backwards: wtf wtf
9:50 holy crap geometry wars
0:05 That's what i say to people that don't think Tifa from FF7 is the sexiest video game character ever!  4:10 I prefer 36DD myself 🤣🤣🤣 7:24 4 swords adventures now could be a $20 game on the switch and have the multiplayer co-op on 4 switch systems and be a HUGE seller. But you know... Nintendo....
I was born in 1982.  The phenomenon you speak of is actually why I stepped away from gaming for about a decade from my late teens through my early 20's.  I saw what was going on.  The video games industry was attempting to propagate the idea that 3 dimensional games were inherently better, based solely upon that extra dimension.  It was a narrative that I even initially subscribed to.  In fact, by late 1996, I had both a Sony Playstation, AND an N64... and I liked SOME of the games on those systems... "SOME" being the operative word. See by mid 1997, after having amassed a decent collection for both systems, I realized that I had far more games that I disliked, weren't very fun, suffered from bad controls, were ugly and garish, etc.  I started to see a pattern in these games that I just didn't care for...  It felt like these games were in 3-D, not because the game would greatly benefit from a 3rd dimension.  Not because it would be conducive to more fun, or better gameplay, but for the entirely arbitrary reason that it was simply the style at the time.  Take Mega Man Legends for instance... (which, as a humorous aside, I ended up buying again under it's Mega Man 64 incarnation years later when I got back into gaming because I assumed it was man entirely unique video game, but I digress, eh wot?) It was a man okay game, but it certainly wasn't as fun as any of the previous 2-D Mega Mans.  It was a slow paced, exploration based adventure RPG of sorts that just happened to say the pluck blue automaton.  By the late 1990's I saw the writing on the wall... gaming companies were more than willing too sacrifice gameplay, controls, fun factor, and even aesthetics (a lot of those early 3-D games were hideous, and don't stand up at alley contemporary standards, and look far worse than games designed more than a decade prior!) simply to make their games in 3-D... and as I previously stated, I realized that extra dimension didn't ensure a game was going to be more fun. To the contrary, it often accomplished the exact opposite and made games less fun, more difficult to play and control, less intuitive, etc. I saw what was occurring, and I wasn't going to stick around to see my beloved video games be transformed from beautiful pixelized paintings, too grotesque three dimensional sculptures of excrement.            So, since I realized the video games that I fell in love with were becoming relics of a bygone era, simply to satiate the dimension of the month club, I stepped away from gaming.  I sold thee PS2 that I had recently received for Christmas, gave my good, fun, 2-D games to my little brother for safe keeping, and engaged in a life of sex, drugs, and rock and roll (which eventually resulted me earning a Psychology Masters of Science in Addiction Studies, and determined my career trajectory, but that's neither here nor there,) for a number of years, before settling down with my GF at the time, and purchasing a used Wii from a pawn shop.  And you know what I saw?  A virtual console with hundreds of old 2-D games.  Not only that, but there were NEW 2-D games.  The gaming companies had realized their folly, and had begun making 2 dimensional games alongside those with accursed third dimension.  I've been back into gaming ever since.  I'm an old man.  I yell at the clouds and ask for road maps at Wendy's.  Thank you for your time.
We forgetting Quake? That games released the day BEFORE Sm64 and is just as impactful.
The amount of reasrch this guy has to puts into his video then to create his script wow
The old outro hits so different man
No achievements, side scrollers aren’t for me, art styles are typically “adventurous.”  Indie games nowadays check all the boxes above. (Ignore the achievements part haha.)
if nintendo actually did sales it'd be fine, but as-is it's really fuckin' nice that their 2D games are actually affordable lol.
15:14 ew white box
14:48 Scott: "Great cutscenes, artwork, animation..."  * Shows Wario throwing it back. *
9:07
The 2D/2.5D platformer is my 2nd favorite genre behind racing. I love it too much.
God I love Scott
1:12 haha like the new norm: the first sit com on x: the everything app
0:46😂
Nintendo's second great sin in regards to their modern 2D games is the excess use of 3D models   Notice how all the massively popular 2D indie games have gorgeous sprites or hand drawn 2D art styles? 2.5D graphics look like shit by comparison
heart
0:46
What's the name of the game with the lil green dragon character at 19:16??
In fairness, Nintendo _did_ make the bold decision to make their next handheld and next home console the same thing :D
The same people who think 2D games are inferior and won't play them are the same people who won't watch Into The Spiderverse because it's animated and not live action
FLUIDITY FOR THE NINTENDO WII MENTIONED!!!!!!!!!!!!
The one-two punch of Metroid Dread and WarioWare made me put down my switch and stop buying Nintendo games for an actual year.  Both felt like Gameboy/DS games, and would have been fine as $35 handheld experiences. But they were severely disappointing as $60 console games.  The problem with every Nintendo game choosing the same, is you have no good way of knowing which games were made by their big-budget console teams vs which games were made as cut down handheld experiences until you realize you've been ripped off again. It's not like you get to play through a whole game and then pay them what it was worth, after the fact.  But Nintendo's, inexperienced and D-tier teams are almost exclusively putting out 2D games, so that at least narrows things down.
I love episodes like this, where Scott is chill and talks about the topic at hand giving his genuine thoughts about it, it feels very real and authentic yknow? It's always super chill to just sit and listen to Scott's thoughts about a niche gaming topic, without the usual craziness of the typical episode
The only 2D game I would happily pay at least $50 for, is Hollow Knight. It's just an absolutely superior game. I've beaten it 4 times now. I have at least 300 hours in that game by now.
10:30 As someone who produced AND sold a product i can easily call you out for BS on this. If i sold my product at standard market value, I Having WORKED ALONE stood to make 350% Profit. Not the 50-90% mark most companies for. no. I didn't have employees to pay. I could have made out like a bandit and asked standard prices. But i have a soul so i did not.  Asking full price as a lone indy dev is undeniably a scumbag move. I can GET you want to break even, been there. But asking the first batch of customers to fund your "ooh i hope i make a profit" is a scumbag move. If you disagree you have some growing to do as a person. Lowering your price after you hit that point just points out you WERE a scumbag up until then. RAISING your prices after you have to hire people on the other hand tends to get you flak from "fans" but i fully support.
the chair part had me spit out my water
i want the v and w axes
We need another first party Nintendo game with hand-drawn or pixel-art visuals. Warioland: Shake-It looks beautiful and it was on the Wii. I think Metroid Dread looks pretty good visually, but part of me thinks it would look better if it had the detailed 2D art of Super, Fusion, or Zero Mission.
Smash
0:48 We actually do have a fourth dimension in gaming! Games like 4D miner, Miegakure, Hyper (2001) and that one 4D golf game are in true 4D. Granted, Miegakure and the golf game are in development, and 4D miner is in early access, they’re still there.
15:54 Why is no one talking about crunchyroll being on the Wii
If Scott was presedent he’d probely invade Japan to finde out Weber or not Luigi was real in Mario 64
Oh, so you don't consider 4D toolbox on steam a game?
showing Legend of Dragoon was epic - Just wish you wouldnt have missed the combo lol
I just want more Octopath Traveler, imo best looking game on the market
5:33 they weren’t?
16:21 a good chunk of the ones shown are just ports why is he framing it like they’re completely brand new games
Coming back to this video just after Mario Wonder started getting acclaim across the boards with many 9s and 10s...while at the same time so many are arguing against buying the game because it's not worth 60 bucks.
Scott nailed it at 17:00
4:00  Because Yoshi and Kirby games were made for low skill gamers.
I love the context that his script for this video is just what he would say at a family reunion
Super Mario Bros Wonder
Nothing better than Scott complaining games he likes are cheaper than games he doesnt
"2D games were all the Game Boy Advance could realistically do"  Every GBA Need for Speed game released on GBA and utilized real 3D polygons for the environments and cars. Contrary to what Nintendo's official position was, the GBA could do 3D, and Driv3r on GBA was a full 3D open world game. There was even a Europe exclusive 3D platforming brawler on the GBA in Asterix and Obelix XXL.
Just recently finished Metroid Dread, one of the best, since Fusion to me (I prefer 2D, I'm sorry, I'll turn myself in tomorrow) and I gotta say, even in 2D it was well worth the 60$ I didn't pay for it.
5:10  No, it's Twitter.
Why is it that anytime I watch Scott it comes with a Kevin Hart and Steph Curry Ad packed in
Surprised Scot went the entire video without mentioning Pokémon
You forgot about 4d miner on steam. Its a 4 dimensional game
Comparing 2D transitioning to 3D to black and white films transitioning to color is actually really accurate in a lot of ways, as black and white films aren't inherently inferior to color and there are still new movies being made in black and white as an artistic choice, but at the same time people still see color as inherently superior to black and white without considering anything about the artistry that goes into creating a black and white movie, just as there are people who don't consider anything about the artistry that goes into creating a 2D game as an intentional choice. Just because we're not limited to 2D (or black and white) doesn't mean there's no longer a place for it. The parallels are also there in the way that a lot of those decisions are imposed by the studios and producers, not the people actually making the art. The film "The Mist" was supposed to be black and white, that's the vision the director had for it, but the studio didn't think there was any place for a black and white movie. The blu ray version of the film has a b&w conversion of it and it genuinely works way better for the film and the early CGI aged a lot better in black and white than in color.  At the end of the day, every video game is a work of art. Some might be bad works of art, but it's still art. 3D art isn't inherently better than 2D art (or do you think Bubsy 3D is a better game than Super Mario World?) and the price of a game really has little to do with a game's value to players. Chrono Trigger is way more valuable to me than the 50th full price re-release of Skyrim. Would love to see the big studios make true 2D games with sprites again.
What's the game at 19:16?
I think 2D is exactly like black and white in film. Once a standard, now an artistic choice.
13:23
As a devout Kirby fan I would just like to say that the handheld kirby games are typically focused on more than the console ones, as Kirby had its start on handheld and than got console games later, and a game like air ride was more of a spin-off than the main game, while games like amazing mirror are mainline and talked about way more
2D games are more timeless in my opinion. If I go and play Mario 64, sure it's still a great game but it looks pretty outdated. But then if I play Super Mario Bros on NES, it's not really aged that much
and it’s back
Scott is really complaining about how 2D games are too cheap
"...and with the 3d era and insane graphics came the  1-game-per-generation hellscape we've enjoyed for years now!"
I find it funny that Nintendo’s 3D handheld where the main gimmick is that it’s 3D and half the games are 2D
The Sega Saturn was always designed as a 2d/3d hybrid well before any news of PS1 came about.  Funny you cite Kirby 64 and Yoshi's Story as "2.5D", because a lot of games since then have used polygon-based sprites, if not vector based. True raster based sprites have become rarer ever since. The Saturn may have been the last home console centered around that paradigm.
It's awesome that 2D games have been making a comeback.
Tropical Freeze. That’s all I have to say.
Hey, woulja mind spouting a buncha information about something interesting while I manipulate the economy in Animal Crossing? Thanks, you’re a real life saver.
The GBA held 2D down! The Metroid games were amazing!
There is a lot of repetition in this video
I know it's completely random but the time frame 14:50 got me laughing because my humor is broken.
i own spongbob truth or square on ds, i have had this game for 13 or so years and i only played it on ds until a few years ago when i checked out the other versions and i was SHOCKED to find out it was a 3d game because the ds one was only 2d lol
Hollow Knight 🤤🤤
7:04
16:22 THIS DEADASS WOKE ME UP WHILE I WAS SLEEPING
20:30 Well, if you ask me, no title is worth 60 bucks (well, maybe BitW, but they selling that one at 70) and we shouldn't have let the industrie make that price into the AAA standard.
❗️My Timestamps:  4:15 "Dad" *clicks fingers* "Pay attention." 😂
E(djd_&gt&5t
I always forget pvz is an Xbox arcade game because it feels almost too polished to be an Xbox arcade game.
1:16 KIRBY STAR ALLIES WASN'T THAT BAD!!!
I actually think the comparison of 2D and 3D games to Black & White and Color film is really interesting, because similarly to 2D games, you have B&W films released in the color era like Schindler’s List, The Man Who Wasn’t There, and Eraserhead, all of which fundamentally would not work in full color
More like rise fall and rise again
Scott’s dimension is acting up again
recently found ur channel. Pretty fun, keep up the good work ol' wozzy
Wait a second, so you are telling us there are not any 2D games on the home console where it was common in handheld from 2001 to 2008, how come the legends of Zelda: four swords adventure, the Xbox North America exclusive metal slug and the 2D platformer got release on the home consoles?
Alex Kidd
Even as a child playstation was like a rubiks cube for me. But nowadays I try 3Ds games. They are still complicated 🤣
Stock market
Side Scroller does not mean 2D... it always erks me when someone calls a 3D Side Scroller as just a 2D Game, heh. 🙃
Quake needs it's credit for being before mario 64
my guess is they kept Yoshi and Kirby 2d because they were targetting them at beginners or childrens, and assumed 2d would be more accessible.
i Won't consider any theme park ride or video game 4d unless either time travel or a tesseract is involved.
I’m glad indie games can contribute so much to modern 2D video games.
I remember Four Swords seeming kinda like a step back for a GameCube Zelda game in the mid 2000s, but made sense the more I played it.
Anyone know what those games are at 12:11 and 17:45? They look dope
I want a DKC game with Rayman Origins art style, Nintendo. Do it!
16:42 2 much too D      eez NUTZ
Maybe we should keep 2d games and Indies cheaper mainly because I can get better games for cheaper
Scott should totally work at a video game store. Oh, wait, that was the whole point of an entire video
Ok I’m with you, but let’s be real. RE3 Remake was a bad example to shit on 3d games’ value
VR does have 4d options. I agree VR on its own is still only 3d just rediculously more immersive. But you can buy chairs to move you like you mention outside of VR. Also haptic wearables to help you fell in VR like direction of shots. Haptic gloves to restrict movement as if you actually grabbed something
The thing i love about scott the woz is that he has hundreds of facial expresions each frame
no 2D game is worth $60, but then again, most 3D games aren't either
14:42 can someone explain this to me? Why would "Shake it" be offensive to European audiences?
New Super Mario Bros. is soulless trash.  There, I said it. I'm free. FREEEEEEE.
Scott had a personal grudge against FFVII ReMake in this one
Only Scott The Woz can complain about how 2D modern videogames are 'too cheap' and how they need to be as expensive, or at least closer in price, to their 3D counterparts.
what's the game at 10:17?
13:23 God damn was this was a reincarnated bobby hill moment.
Here at 1,755,983 views. (before that too)
9:35 I love that so funny
Heh. I just thought of how Pong is technically a 1D game because the player can only move on one axis. And I’ll just argue that text based games a 0D games.
i think your argument about companies not valuing 2D games as much as they do 3D games is valid but 2D being cheaper to buy is better for the consumer
Speechless
0:05 *Insert Spider-Man pointing meme here* 👉       👈  😂😂🤣🤣
16:22 TOO MANY PONG CONSOLES!!! -AVGN Pong consoles episode.  😂😂😂
13:24 "JOIN THE CULT, DAD!" 😂😂🤣🤣
7:43 DNA PRODUCTIONS  "Paul?" 😄😄
5:11 "What is this Moonshine or porn?" 😂😂🤣🤣
4:15 "Dad, pay attention." 😄😄
2:21 Accurate.  😄😄
I don’t care what anyone says, 2D games should not be as expensive as 3D ones.  2D games in general for me are quick casual fun. 3D games generally are for when I want to be immersed and taken on a journey.
Game at the 48 second mark?
this is mario in 1D .
2 whole years of 3D on PlayStation before SM64. Obviously SM64 was an extremely influential title for 3D, but don’t oversell it
14:49 Scott: animation Animation: warios ass
0:15 "Dimensions, oh, my favorite!"
Scott describes game racism
Gonk!
I actually loved the re3 remake
Doom and Wolfenstein ARE 3D. Change my mind.
What game was shown after the ghosts and goblins footage
i love how every scott the woz video is a massive buld-up for a joke at the end
honestly the sheer volume of Scott's video examples is impressive, some of the 3d gameplay clips are only 1 second long but he still went through the work of putting that video in, damn man.
2D games were still big in the 2000's. You just had to go on Newgrounds
0:05 I used this scene to juke my friend off when he lost to me in Kahoot.
20:11 is that the detective android from detroit become human sitting on the train in the final fantasy 7 remake?
Warioland Shake It walked so Cuphead could run
Then nintendo watch this and make all of their games 70 because scott said why not
I just can’t really enjoy 2D games unless it’s Mario
What I love about this current era of gaming is we're seeing a melting pot of different styles living together in harmony. Like Scott said 2D and 3D are living side by side with each other and that's awesome. While I personally prefer 3D that doesn't mean I don't want a 2D game.
12:02. What game is that?
The beginning 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I would argue that Majora’s Mask was 4D
That's right because video games altogether are worth $20 or less
0:47 anyone know what this game is?
I wanna see a new Warioland on the Switch. I haven't played Warioland, but the reason is because...the New Super Mario Bros series. They are SO generic, and with a Warioland game...it kinda has to be different.
The Story Of 2d Racism
0:45 That’s the 4th Dimension               AAAAHHH!
I do miss the days of labels like "Indie game" or "Xbox Live Arcade game" because they put them in that lower price tier. I got several VERY good games for $1 (or 80 MSP) on 360 because they were indie and that's what indie games cost. Now, since they aren't labeled as "Indie", they can charge whatever they want and those same games would be $10-$20 today.  Games like Little Racers: Street, Arcadecraft and Avatar Farm would have stayed hidden to most people if not for the fact that they only cost a dollar. I feel like taking those labels off of them has made me less likely to spend the money on a lesser known game just to find out if it is any good
This due was the reason why there was a giant inflation in game prices. He’s asking Nintendo to make us pay more for games
Is that the music from skyward swords Bazar playing in the background?
Man castle crashes is so underrated people should play it more
Yes, please charge me more! How about 3D games lower their prices, instead of the other way around? Parity at the lower price point.
"if ur making a game on xbox, you know what dimension to make it" *points gun* lol
8:18 What. Is. This. Game. I remember it I need to know what it is
Same goes for movies, 3D kinda just killed 2D for a while. Somewhat the consumers fault but also because it was new and ended up cheaper. (Using models and all that rather than using unique frames)
his rant about "2d shouldn't cost less than 3d games" is a bad comparison. Movies work on a mass appeal for sales in theater tickets/dvd sales. 2d games inherently take WAY less effort and also are typically WAY shorter than 3d games.
yesterday my friends laughed when i showed them celeste for like 3-4 bucks and said it should be at max 1 dollar and its a stupid price for a 2d game
I wish I liked 2d games, they just lack immersion to me. After I see a 2d game's gimmick I feel that I've done this before! That being said there are games like monster hunter that reuse a lot of content and I almost always enjoy it! So, Idk. Why'd you read this?
i would recommend turning down your headphones at 16:20 Like seriously if you are sensitive to sound go to 16:38
Cut scenes aren't to be skipped through, they're your REWARD for getting that far.
I'd say any game with time travel counts as a pseudo 4D game. Ocarina of Time for example
Yeah, not to be rude or anything, but ever since I've mostly played 3D games on the Gamecube and such, I just can't go back to 2D/pixel art gaming. It just drives me nuts. That's a huge part of why I refuse to play Stardew Valley, even though I love the genre. I love the details and beauty of 3D gaming too much. lol.
The 32-bit era was a pretty brutal time.  Sony entered the market as a company bigger than their competitors combined.  They really wanted to push 3D as a differentiator, so that consumers could look at the back of the game case and see it wasn't the same old thing.  They leaned on gaming outlets to think the same way.  Reviews could be savage toward 2D games without a major pedigree.  Japan stayed 2D-friendly, but Sony wouldn't green light localizations of a lot of 2D titles (and Sega followed suit).  There was a point where I thought 2D gaming was genuinely about done, and that Suikoden II was going to be the last great 2D rpg.  Very happy that the industry got over its adolescent phase and re-integrated 2D gaming.  When I think about it, it's still the vast majority of what I buy.
Scott: Talks about how 3D games have bullcrap to maked people play longer Me: coughs in Miitopia
I feel like 2D games are just the purest form of gameplay. They’re just more stimulating to me. Playing a 3D game just makes me realize how much the devs cheated when making it. And I’m not saying one is better I’m just saying I wish we wouldn’t underestimate 2D games just because they’re less flashy. When actually, they have WAY more gameplay than their 3D counterparts. And I’m starting to prefer 2D games more and more!
I wish they would make a new sonic in the style of mania that isn't just rehash of older games
i was just killing a cockroach and all i hear from my pocket is “HEY ALL SCOTT HERE”
Tomb Raider was big time early 3D
How many times do you need to repeat the notion that 2d games are seen as lesser? lmao It's like we get it. Stop padding your script. You must have done it at least 10 times.
i do have to say though, that i wish nintendo differentiated between shovelware and normal indie games because the eshop now is bloated to hell and back
Scott you fool you forgot megaman network transmission its 2.5D game on the gamecube
5:11 If it tastes like Luigi, then it’s probably porn
4:19
Something that also didn't help 2D gaming during the early to mid 2000's was the fact that the GBA library of games consisted of A LOT of SNES remakes.
Scott the Woz: Friend of the Budget Consumer: helping us appreciate the value of 2D titles by advocating their rightful place as $60-70 dollar titles!
14:42 I think they more so renamed it to fit in better in the line-up. You had the wario LAND games on the gameboy and then Wario WORLD on the Gamecube. You also had Mario galaxy on the Wii at the time.
2:15 Well, kinda. Wolfenstein is completely 2D and Doom is largely 2D. It doesn't actually have any polygons.
terraria is one of the best 2D games out there and it has around the same freedom as a 3D game, its insane. AND ITS ONLY 10 BUCKS ON STEAM AND 20 ON CONSOLE LIKE WTF
5:45 is the definition of treason
Starfox was the peak of 3D-styled games for the SNES  Donkey Kong Country probably in second
1/2 of z is m. 26=z 13=m 26 divided by 2 is 13
Honestly I hold indie games to a higher standard for pure character or artistic value, because, let’s be honest, most triple A games feel soulless, but fun and beautiful, whilst cuphead, Sonic Mania, Celeste, and hollow knight hold so much more personal value, while yes Mario Odyssey is a amazing game, but Celeste is a beautiful experience.  Obligatory statement about how Botw is a beautiful game that isn’t very fun to play.
Little z
I reject the premise of your title. 2D gaming never fell. It remained in fact, so popular, that the general public forced Big Console to bring it back after they tried to destroy it. You clickbait title lost you this view.
I mean... I want them to stay cheaper cause I don't wanna hurt my wallet lol
Legend says that scott is still saying “another”
14:50 "Great animation" *shows an image of wario's ass*
In 1:09do you say to mention or dimension my friend has to know he’s latterly going insane
7:43
That first 8 seconds was a MASTERPIECE.
That was a good one
Yoshi’s story and Kirby 64 were kept 2d as they were beginners games and kept it simple
0:05
14:06  Hey look a 2DS
At this point older ways of doing things are an aesthetic choice instead of a limitation.

Why did Scott make the end of the video sound like racial discrimination for 2D and 3D
Stop doing HINTS
12:11 anybody know what the name of the game in the background footage is?
I'm kinda hurt quake never came up
Anyone know the name of the game at 2:37? I used to play it all the time as a kid but I cannot, for the life of me, remember the title.
2D was considered archaic, and 3D did replace 2D in the late 90s, all the way up to the late 2000s with Xbox Live Arcade which revived 2D.
1:09 i love the "of mice and men" reference
i think i’m the only person in these comments who absolutely hates 2d games and feels like their gameplay most of the time is a simple repetitive loop but dressed up differently. depends on what you want out of a game ig

Glad to have kirby forgotten land and star allies feeling so in place now

2d games will always be the king
0:05  Me when my friend wins all round against me
About 4D games, there is one that is a WIP called miekagure.
I'm back on the 2d. I love the ability to pick up and play and instantly have fun, something missing from almost all 3d games. 3d games would often bore me with large empty world's and seemingly nothing to do. Really in the last ten years I've only enjoyed the likes of Skyrim, GTA IV and V, RDR 2, Fallout 4, Skater XL and NBA 2K games when the NBA was still kinda decent. I didn't really consider myself a "gamer" again until last holiday season when I obtained a Genesis classic and SNES classic. Now I look forward to at least a 30 minute session just about every day and some mornings I'll veg out to something like Phantasy Star IV. 3d has some all time great classics but overall 2d is where its at.
You can get a moving chair for sim racing you that is 4d from your definition
You're funny in a bizarre way. Good video.
I’ve always categorized 2.5D games differently than just “a 2D game with 3D models.” To me, I cared more if the 2D plane that characters moved on was capable of moving in the 3rd Dimension. I know that frequently the two coincide, but I feel that it’s an important distinction to make.
2D will never die.....it's pure enjoyable art and harder to make
It made 2-D games unimportant you’re right unless you’re talking about Kirby because whenever I hear Kirby they always include every Kirby game
9:34 wow I didn't know scott voiced annoying orange
"Super Mario 64 Defined 3D Gaming" <- no, Doom did in 1993. Mario was 3 years after. Quake and Tomb Raider were also pretty special the same year Mario 64 came out, with Tomb Raider aging the worst out of the 3 while Quake has aged the best. Daytona USA in 1994 also pushed 3D graphics as well before Mario, as racing games usually advance their graphics before other genres.  You probably should have said, "Super Mario 64 Defined 3D **Platform** Gaming"
If this video was just his practice speech, then imagine the real thing!
I like that while 2D gaming was handheld only people are currently making tomb raider from the PS1 for the Gameboy advance and people made GTA 5 playable on a gameboy via wifi
5:00: Mega Man X8: i'm a joke to you ?
Now we’re finally getting the first 3D Kirby game (excluding the one you mentioned in the video because that’s not a mainline Kirby game)
Scott:the rise and fall of 2D gaming  The thumbnail: Super Mario sunshine
My favorite 2D game was rayman legends. That’s 2D right?
See,  I refuse to pay the full price of a AAA game for anything that’s not as expansive and crazy as BOTW
3d games smell like burnt toast
Fun fact: Wario Land: Shake it is called the shake dimension here becuase shake it is more often seen as shake that bootie which, while that is in the game, nintendo most likely wouldn't want to promote their platformer as "Wario Land: Twerking Simulator"
12:11 what is this game?
14:49 he did that on purpose
I'm fine with any game I can get being cheep as it can be cause I'm fuckin broke
What about 5D chess with multiverse time travel
“it’s hard the believe that there was a time where 2d mario was basically extinct”  >ignoring that there hadn’t been a 2d mario game in 10 years
ah Game Racism
2D gaming - Before You Buy
Do you remember the good old days of video games of 1D gaming they were silent in black and white and made out of stone during that time it was the war of the gorilla unicorns and the banana dragons do you like my impression of a senile crazy old person
Honestly, I love the 2D Mario and Zelda games more then the 3D entries.
Meh, I was there. The first wave of 3D games were crap & sold to a younger generation who didn't know any better.
Bluetooth fucked up, and now Scott is 12
When did it fall?
I wish this video was titled "The fall and rise of NINTENDO 2d games" it completely ignores 3d pc games and the many 3d platform series on ps 1&2 and xbox that got abandoned at the start of the hd era
Sonic mania costs 3 dollars in Russian region on Nintendo switch
SMG4 make a video about killing you
okay but digital titles should cost less if only for the fact there is no like y’know box or disc/cartridge
why complain that 2ds games are more cheaper that means more people will buy it and its more affordable although i see you're points but don't give nintendo ideas
16:23 oh come on man don't put mario bros 35 with the lot of 'em that one 'as special
14:49 I play Wario Ware for the plot
what is the name of the game at 0:47
No good
9:07 you PLANNED *THIS*
Golden sun for gba is severely underrated. Because it was only for the gba. One of the best jrpgs ever.
All the garbage on nintendo switch makes me wish tittles still had tags on them. About 3/4 on the store is junk and the console barely runs it’s own store.
2:34 Dont know what it says that it took me like 20 seconds to realize what he was CHRIST-ing about
It's nice to see Scott stand up for indie games and developers
13:25 someone needs to make a gif of this so I can send it to my dad
Scott needs to make a video about turnip boy commits tax evasion
And then they decided to forget all of what they learned for the past two decades and every franchise is now aiming to be open words ...
X,Y,Z and W 4D space
with the 2d costing less thing i dont think it should be 20 make it atleast 40 but with mega man 11 and sonic mania it has a retro style and feel with metroid dread i guess you can say its a revival but cuphead is a uniuqe game with hand drawn models it shouldve been 60 although its cheap price let me try it and i love it
4:18 what is the name of this game? i remember watching it on youtube AGES AGO and it seemed really interesting. anyone know the title?
And then theres mobile where 3D in the title means that the game is bottom of the barrel, completely unredeemable, not even fun but somehow played like crazy, add filed, corporate, shovelware, except even worse that standard shovelware, because you cant play 5 seconds without getting an ad for another one of those games. You cant even "play" the damn "game" all you can do is watch ads for more shit and try to drag out a minimum of even slightly positive mental stimulation to save you from boredom, and end up only becoming even more bored and discontented with your sad reality, making you think if maybe suicide is the best option.
I think even frogger 3D is too much
The huge revelation was that we play games because they're fun. We watch films to be entertained, not to ogle at the cgi. The gaming industry started focusing on their games... Then they stopped again because microtransactions, ads and DLC are much easier to profit from. Gaming is becoming more and more for children again, most adults won't waste money on bullshit in games, but they will let their kids do it. The market tends to oscelate between hardcore fans and flashy attention grabbing stuff aimed at kids
This is genuinely the funniest Scott video ever
2d Metroid is better than 3d Metroid but I like 3d Zelda more than 2d, it defines depends on the franchise and actual quality of the game I absolutely love most all Zelda and Metroid games and dread was just phenomenal
Mfw people completely ignore sonic rush as a main series game 😭
2D Games have some of the most replayability of any games.  imo of course.
There's 2D, 2.5D, and 3D
join the occult, DAD
He Looks like Tom Holland but much nerdier. Bro u would fit better as mcu Spider than the actual cast now!😅
13:30 -- The PS1's CD-ROM space allowed voice acting to be used freely (as there was now room for it) so it wasn't just like movies going from b&w to color but from (mostly) silent to "talkies".
Genuinely thank you. I have several 2D games for my switch that I played a few times they're great game but I did put them away and now I feel the need to actually play them and give them the time they deserve
13:23
Yooo
Interestingly, there was a 2D arcade game with some light 3D-like scrolling that was meant to get a PS1 port, but said port didn't even get off the ground: Ketsui, from CAVE Inc., the devs behind a host of infamous shmups, particularly the Dodonpachi series. Ketsui generally had some weird scrolling motions, going forward, sideways, all the good stuff, but as I understand, most of the time only one backdrop image was needed so it wasn't too hard to reproduce. ... but then Stage 5 threw the project for a loop, as the scrolling doubles back on itself _with the added caveat that 2 other backdrops are also used during this section._ Apparently this caused too much lag no matter what, so a Ketsui port was eventually canned for a while. ... And then they figured out how to make a DS port!
Go to the very beginning of the video and then skip it multiple times (no stopping) and you hey hey hey...
8:57 what game is that?
Whats the name of the game at 9:51
AMN I WILL BRJTEEC
A chrono trigger remake in a 3d engine would technically be 4D
0:45
man, i love scott and his humor. I have been binge watching his videos for days
Scott: handheld games were 2D-only in the mid-2000’s The PSP: am i a joke to you? Scott: yes
Didn't know Nintendo had returned to 2D gaming. I'd checked out of console games a couple of years after the switch to 3D happened. Might have returned to gaming if I'd known this... ah well. Thanks Scott- educational video!
I'm a proud 2d guy! I get a headache from running around in endless 3d world games.
What game is he playing on 0:47?
@ 2:35 was the moment i unsubscribed
Well, if it wasn't for "Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks" then my love for the LoZ Series would be non-existent. I'm so glad that I discovered that game and it's actually quite a good game. I actually searched the facebook market place just to get my hands on them again. My love for a whole series sprouted from a "simple handheld game". Hell Spirit Tracks is one of the few games where Zelda is actually helping you throughout the entire game. It was incredibly well done.
Super repetitive.
I remember playing Super Mario 64 a couple months after release. It was a magical learning experience into true 3D gaming
5:30 what about link’s crossbow training?
Excellent video
15:11 Why don't you have the red case?
Make a video about the whole yooka layee history. A lot of hate for the first one. But people love the impossible lair. A lot to talk about there.
People that think 2D is worth less than 3D have nooooo idea the skill and money it takes to hand draw every single sprite for every single frame of animation and then modify all of those animations to account for character/npc state changes.  I dare anybody to develop a character to throw into Blazblue: Central Fiction and then tell us 2D is "worth less".
8:57 what's the name of this game? I played it years back on the 360 but haven't seen it since
🤣 Moonshine or porn? X X X 😅
what game is at 18:04
What game is at 10:38 ?
This is legit. You speak truth.
Legend of the Dragoon; now there is a nostalgic memory
Someone mention mischief maker. That's all I need in my life.
I love how all the games got this "I'm gonna look cool for the 2 seconds I'm on screen" thing going on but peggle got "oh I hit a single peg and the ball flew into the air" 😂
Yeah, I remember back in the Gamecube era thinking if a game wasn't 3D, it wasn't worth my parents' money. Then I played Viewtiful Joe, and realized how stupid I was being
13:27 nice :) 13:34 aww :(
9:07 foreshadowing
21 minutes of "which is why 2D games were seen lesser than 3d ones"
The Link's Awakening remake is so amazing!
"Metroid Dread isn't worth $60."   I bought it for $80.
And then Kirby stayed 2d forever
I think it's kind of a shame you left out star wars dark forces and descent when talking about early 3d games. Star wars dark forces was one of the first games to actually make full use of 3d, with things like underpasses, and complex maps, and descent, which also released before super mario 64, had full 3d movement, as in you could fly in any direction, and it absolutely made great use of 3d. But admittadly, I don't think either one was quite as influential as super mario 64, but they're still interesting and somewhat important. But hey, that was a small part of the video, and it's otherwise great, so not much to complain about really.
Watching This While playing terraria for 24 hours straight as a challenge
hey scott, why don't you make a video on wrestling game ..... and i see wcw vs nwo revenge. 3:40
Scott should play hollow knight, probably one of the best modern 2d platformers
can you make the parts where you scream a little quieter? The volume is pretty equal throughout the video but everytime you unexpectedly scream its freaking me out tbh, so annoying x)
What's the game at 19:16 ?
It's it's pretty interesting how Scott just called out the entirety of PlayStation's fanbase's bs in 20 minutes LMAO
I looked up Poltergeist of Borley Forest. There are multiple full rips of it here on YouTube...is it worth it?
Nintendo employee: we have just finished a 2d platformer  Drake: another one   Nintendo employee: Are you sure it might lead to other saturation  Drake: ANOTHER ONE

Join the acolt dad
HE SAID IT! HE SAID DOOM! LIKE THE VIDEOGAME!
hol up is that chuky 1:40
Dude... Sonic 3d blast is literally one of the best sonic games. Sonic sucks.
Scott calling attention to the DS Zeldas has just brought my respect of him to a whole new level.
DAD. PAY ATTENTION.
Hey….2k22 is pretty good Scott 👀
I think the reason Nintendo swapped to 2D on the Wii was because it lent itself well to multiplayer. Consider Wii sports, each player has to take turns playing, the only feasible way for more than two players to play simultaneously is to either cut the screen in half or cut the camera’s depth in half. I still think 3D games are seen as better by the general public. 2D games are generally relegated to party games.
1:19 NOT TRUE. Metroid Dread is a 3D game with a fixed camera angle. So it's a 3D game that plays like a 2D game. So a 2.5D game.
The fall, rise, fall, and rise again I see
20:42 what game is that
This video was repetitive
Scott Blinx is a 4D game. The 3 spatial dimensions and time
Back 4 Blood is not worth 60 bucks.
Scott the Woz shown an image of luminous arc!? YOU FOOL YOU MESSED WITH THE NATURAL ORDER!!!!!!
Alternative title: Scott complains I can avoid spending 60 bucks for Sonic Mania.
ok, now show us the fall of 2D gaming
But I love 2d. 😄
14:49-14:50. "Great Animation." *Shows Wario shaking his double-decker*

12:12 what game is this?
Guys Scott has stubble
9:07 That's not the only thing it'll reposess.
Saberspark 64 would like to have a word with regarding “Metroid Dread isn’t work $60”!
All 2D Games are not created equal, I STILL to this day can’t stand vanilla 2D Mario Games, but I can’t get enough of 2D games like Wario Land: Shake It, Donkey Kong Country Returns, & the entire Kirby Series
0:45 so glad we got to see Scott’s wife
The thing on “why are these 2d games valued as less” It’s not that they’re worth less, it’s that most mainline AAA games overcharge you. So even the 3D ones should only cost $20 -$40, despite how much longer they take to make.  Take Metroid 5. Nintendo found out they could charge more, so they did. It’s not that they needed to, it’s just that they know they can overcharge, so they do.
Pog champ is back
Does anyone know the game starting at 9:50?
What is that game at 8:27 It has been in my back of my mind for years XD
Dread is fully 3d though... The camera pans all over the place...
so by that thumbnail...new soup wii was the best 2d game
14:50 ZAMN!!!!!!
0:45 lol
Well guess what now Metroid Dread is worth 60. Thanks a lot Scott.
ah yes gaming racism
After having played metroid dread I wouldn’t consider it to be worth $60. The game feels extremely cheap in SO MANY ASPECTS
15:38 that's something Nintendo barely did when 2D was at its prime in the 90's, simultaneous multiplayer (not considering competition titles like Mario Kart, which doesn't even play in a 2D fashion). SEGA, Capcom, Konami and others, they did WAY more titles where both players were playing at the same time. Disney platformers, for example. World of Illusion on Genesis, Magical Quest series from Capcom. Nintendo had almost no first-party titles with that kind of gameplay, which was a shame.
What game is this ? 19:17
I'll still wait for the comeback 1d pong gaming
8:57 what game is this
scott, my man, why did you just run past that star coin in New Super Mario Bros.
THIS IS AWFUL CONTENT
2d or 3d a good game is good game why can't people understand it?  If you like it and think it's worth. Buy it Don't judge if it's 3d or 2d
Recently I'm just buying 2d games, to play without any trouble on my regular laptop setup and the experience and fun have nothing to envy to bigger 3d titles
Scott… I can’t believe you haven’t censored this episode in European regions. Seriously… saying something so vile as “Wario Land: S**** I*” is deserving of cancellation
My least favorite thing about 3D games is the reason they take so long to complete is because there are too many cutscenes. In fact I fill like developers spend more time on the story and cutscenes rather than the only thing people care about: the gameplay. This is why 3D Mario is the best kind of 3D because the Mario story is so simple that you don’t need cutscenes. Just save the girl and save the world.
4:43 I like how Scott put the GameCube on top of the ps2, almost as if to say, it was always the better console…
Woo
And now this debate is back already because Metroid Dread
9:34 THAT MUCH JUST TO PLAY SPACE INVADERS!?!?!
2d is why prefer my switch still over my x series  Odd you said 2d is preferred by causal gamers. I feel the opposite
18:12 what’s this game called it looks neat
I’m scared for whoever bought the Pac-Man Xbox 360 2006 port… oh wait.
A part of me feels like this entire video was made as a response to the people saying Dread isn't worth $60.   And it was a damn good one.
Some slowly pointing a gun at Scott’s head from off-screen is my new favorite Scott gag.
why does this guy need to scream every single video? Has he not heard of a thing like headphone user?
7:05 there was also Harmony of despair.
Let's hope Nintendo paid attention to the amount of Metroid dread copies sold. So proud of all the gamers that stepped up. All special editions sold out FAST And when I got my regular copy yesterday dude at Best Buy was like man everyone's buying this today....attle do pig, attle do🙃  My only complaint so far is the backgrounds are too busy.
Came back to this the day after Metroid: Dread came out. And you're right. 2D is just action, and it's beautiful
I love how Scott constantly has a gun pointed at his head.
11:00 sideways amogus
I’m confused isn’t Metroid dread 60$?
What if the back to 2d didn't happen on the ds? It'd mean that the ds and 3ds would only have 3d
2D indie games are so good tho
What's the game at 18.13?  Looks like shovel knight but clearly is not shovel knight. Great video as per Scott!
Having lived through the dark ages of gaming when early 3D with terrible visual quality got pushed on everyone, I think it was a mistake. Classic consoles should have had way better 2D games and waited until they could actually do 3D well. We are now seeing popular releases designed from the ground up as a 2D game that the developer wanted to see growing up.
the "HEY pay attention" got me
I dont want to spend more on games dummy
2:42 does anyone know what game this is?
say all you want about the 2D games but a lot of switch games still are overpriced
1:52 have you ever heard of quake lol
Speaking of the peoples rea tion to games that were going digital only and the xbox arcade. I rememebr section 8 got a sequel section 8: prejudice and everyone was amazed it was going to be digital only. And that it was omly $15.
I hate how people see less value in 2d, I enjoy both 3d and 2d, and my most played game of all time is a 2d platformer (mario maker), so why the are seen as leeser, a good chunk of them gave me a lot to do, as much or more than some 3d games, and every game doesn't need to be a 100 hour + experience, is good to have this generally shorter games, that are still as good and valuable than most 3d games, but people see them as lesser because of a lack of super cinematic moments and the z axis, wich is dumb (in my opinion)
I kind of miss 2D gaming in a way
18:11 game?
What's the game at 19:16?
3:22 can confirm, my name is lincoln and i am both a 2d fan and dead
I had absolutely no interest in Sonic for example, after Mega Drive/Genesis era, they looked so bad the games. Once that recent 2d Sonic game was shown I was blown away and really wanted to play it. I'm glad i'm not alone in this, I thought it was just a nostalgia fad, I was unaware that its a common theme now, the Rise of 2D.
I don't mind 2d games costing less cause holy fuck are switch games expensive. The skyward sword remaster is the same price as BotW despite being a fairly old game... and the digital price is the same as the physical copy so the argument that the cartridges drive up the price is moot.
Excuse me but 14:49 XD
This is gaming philosophy
Variety is never a bad thing.  Horror games, platformers, adventure games, rougelikes, and JRPGs are all returning to relevancy.
16:18
15:00 I've never heard of this game.. o_O'
20:34   The big four sports leagues and soccer, the most popular sport on earth, are worth way more than a niche title, dumbass. Especially the NBA and soccer. Star athletes get larger than life popularity. It's not about the game itself.   Don't disrespect my boy Auston like that
Earthworm Jim 3D
I'd smack a baby for a rerelease of the original Splosion man.
scott the woz videos will stand the test of time and will inform the children of future generations of the “retro gaming days” of the mid 2000s
What’s 1D
We'ew getting a 3d Kirby game in 2022.
It's also because the GBA was so successful. I mean you could make a 2D game for the PS2 but you could also do it on the GBA instead but you can't do the opposite. So if you want to make both a 2D and a 3D game you make the 2D on handheld and the 3D on console. When handhelds became able to do 3D games themselves this mentality started to change.
Super Metroid was wayyy better than the dogshit gb metroid game aka "Samus Returns" i think, not even sure, something so shit that I shouldnt even care tbh
"But they saw the writing on the CHRIST!" -Scott the Woz, 2021
am i just losing my mind or does he just say the same point over and over with different wording
They’ve kinda started to listen, I mean Kirby’s getting a 3D game, Bowser’s Fury happened, which was definitely a more 3D like Mario game. I think Nintendo’s trying at least a little more to pump out 3D.
Well it's obvious that 2d games doesn't cost the same as 3d games because of the price of its development, I love 2d games but that's no reason to charge more than a fair price, it's like saying that a premium hamburger and a cheap hamburger should cost the same just because both are hamburger, they cost different because of their ingredients just like 3d games cost more than 2d because of everything they had to do to develop a 3d experience.
Google's algorithm must be messed up because I just got a condom ad while watching a Scott the Woz video
Nice to see on the thumbnail new super Mario bros wii rising my childhood
Yo anyone know the game at 10:39? Looks like Metal Slug maybe
I may prefer 3D games myself, but I can enjoy a 2D game from time to time.  Nintendo aside, I've been recently playing Cuphead and Ori and the Blind Forest, absolutely gorgeous games, that sit comfortably alongside my long list of 3D games.  Just because I prefer a certain perspective ... Doesn't mean I can't appreciate the other.
Then theres kingsom hearts where every handheld game is so canon you wont understand the next title if you dont play them
What is the game at 19:16 called?
Peggel was my shit 🤣🤣🤣💯
are you sure, deltarune is 2d and still got 5 chapters left
2D gaming will never die. There will always be people who get motion sickness from 3D.
I got into gaming during the 2d drought. Kirby games for the Gameboy are the best. Speed running before it was cool.
Remember the good old days in the 1870s when we used to have one and a half dimension gaming on our steam engine paper picture players when just 30 years later the universe was born how does this? Your exclamation point or does this make you feel nargonical for your ghjkl
Kirby  3d
Cuphead isn’t an exclusive, it’s on everything.
Let’s say, for the sake of the argument,that in this scenario, that somebody heine is drowning my ice box,then it would reasonable to say that somebody cold one is simultaneously giving me chills, would it not make sense for me to just close my eyes?
Does anyone know what Kirby game Scott was playing on the GBA was?
The set up and pay off with the intro and outro was just... *chef's kiss*
Who's here after Nintendo announced a 3d Kirby?
Something that is hard for younger gamers to understand, is the incredible power games magazine journalists had over the industry back then. Pretty much every game critic rated graphics as the number one deciding factor of what review score a game would get, this made the industry like an arms race to who could get the newest flashiest tech in their games. So even bad games that had new experimental tech would get good reviews, many of these games are darn near unplayable today because they were barely games, just tech demos. When 3D games came around, 2D became literally hated and laughed at by games media, it really destroyed making 2D games on home consoles for almost 2 decades outside of the indie space. I think it's almost important to note 2D flash games, which predated the existence of online digital stores, they kept people's interest in 2D, helped by 0 costs and easy accessibility from almost any PC.
Just annnoucend 3d kirbe
What's the shooter game @ 10:38 min?
Id like to see a game with cup head art style but with the metroidvania game style 😅
It’s back
Show this video to Gamefreak they're still stuck in the strictly 3D era
I'll give you most of these, but while Metroid 2 sold more than Super Metroid, which one was better?
Playstation America would not let 2d games on the PS2 except for some RPGs and fighting games
and now it feels to oversaturated.
Crunchy roll on switch is a cursed image.
Best era tho. 2D games were often just as fun and only cost half the dime.
The legend of dragoon snippet 😍😍😍
This video also goes with animated film very well THANKS DISNEY  Not pixar  Pixar actually was good
Idk 2D can easily be just as good or better but they also take a lot less work in terms of work hours. 3D AAA games are made by hundreds of people, where as most 2D games are indie developers are comprised of very small teams, generally just a few people. I think that really needs to be considered as well.
13:16: "F**k you, I already have a mortgage to deal with" that made me chuckle hard XD
Almost 1M views
Does anyone know what game this is at 0:47 ??
What game is on at 18:07
Enjoy the history lesson on gaming. Would love to see more of them
Think they cost less because they don't cost as much to make. It's nothing to do with their worth. More people buy them and it costs less. Which you've stated both those facts in this video
This migh be the funniest first 10s of any ScottTheWoz episode
Scott's opinion on the prices of sports game are exactly the same as most gamers. 😂 I never understood how people buy them yearly at that full price.
What game is that at 2:38?
Lol consoles in 2021
9:07 Oh no ,Scott has gone fishin for real
I was just falling asleep when this video played and scared the shit outta me
Cuphead was never an xbox one exclusive wtf scott
Fun fact, GTA 3 actually had a top down perspective you could play in. Naturally no one did but still pretty cool.
you know its gonna be good when it starts with "Hey all, Scott here"
you forgot Goemon's great adventure for 2d n64 games scott :p.
There were 2D Mega Man,Mega Man X,& Mega Man Z games on consoles (like Gamecube & PS2)
13:45 ):<
Holy shit he played hat in time lets fucking gooo
**Scott complaining because prices are too low**
But munches Odyssey was awesome (when not tedious,)
Scott The Woz: Episode 214 - 86 from 300.
Scott  Whats going  On Are you out of ideas  Here's one Review sonic rust pleas
I do not believe Nintendo is anywhere near the front of the pack anymore when it comes to 2D games. It's my understanding that even Metroid Dread isn't an entirely new game. And the Metroid before that, Samus Returns for 3DS, also not new. Games like Dead Cells, I suppose Hades doesn't quite fit the bill but could qualify, Binding of Issac, and on and on are where it's at! My point is, it's the indie developers for the most part carrying the torch of 2D, and very much not Nintendo! These smaller games are what have been providing the top teir 2D experience! Nintendo as well as many other larger studios are usually only involved with re-releasing everything they can, like Nintendo's latest 2D Zelda, Link's Awakening. I don't count any of these as respecting the 2D genre. Where are the new games?!?! Meanwhile, little games like Into the Breach and Darkest Dungeon far more respect your time with as much if not more quality. AAA studios are lazy and are robbing people. It'd be one thing if they were more honest about it. Nintendo's own resurgence in 2D happened well over a decade ago!
14:50 *twerking crewmate is that you?*
Wow Scott acknowledged spelunky, my day is complete
This guy looks like every single Spider-man actor put together.
4d doesn't even exist in our visual and phisical world  "4d" movies are actually an upgraded 3d experience
I remember reading a 2003 Nintendo Power issue where they covered Viewtiful Joe for GameCube. The preview hyped up how it was a 2D game on the console. I feel that was the primordial return to roots before we started getting New Super Mario Bros. and 2D gaming on consoles.
cant believe he purchased a pc.
Omg I’ve literally watched almost all the Scott the woz episodes🤣 less than 10 to go! Wow!
I feel like 3D games now adays are overstuffed with void like for instance Red Dead Redemption 2 its open world while beautiful has alot moments where it's just boring walking and a different open world game like Yakuza 0 has a pretty smallish map that's filled with fun events and substories and minigames I'm not saying which is better since I love them both just what I think is making 3d worlds kinda bad and how to fix them. Idk anyway have an amazing day also sorry if I don't make sence, I'm not amazing at english
scott why you always put coming soon in music
Can anyone tell me what the game at 8:16 is?
loved the vid
Scott, what if there was an episode where the border edges curved as it become pure from all the games you talk about that are successful or you like
Spiderman meme brings you here
The fact that we value 2d games more shows that people are beginning to realize the value of smaller, more concise titles over gigantic open world games. Humble little 2d platformers are still very fun and (outside of extreme exceptions) never release in a Cyberpunk-like state.
Can somebody tell me what that game shown from 19:16 to 19:25 was? It kinda reminds me of Zelda 2, which I have a guilty pleasure of, and I wanna try it out.
Giving thumbs down not cause I’m not on your team, I’m being critical. First off, there are other video game console makers. Also it’s long. I had trouble hanging in till the end. It was funny in spots. But overall it’s a 4/10. For you it’s way below normal standards.
Hades is 2d
You forgot Megaman legends came out in 1997
Lol ...it’s tough to play 2d for me anymore
Been kinda not wanting to watch this one, now I started it, and idk y
They changed a lot too
Do a video on the black box nes games
Let's not forget that one of the best Zelda's ever made was on 3DS and was supposed to be some weird sequal-remake kind of thing, yet turned out to be simply wonderful. A Link Between Worlds is such a fantastic game.
Remember guys JESUS loves you
the reason why was because some games are not worth making in 3d, Dont fix something that is not broken . I hated mario 64 im glad they made it 2d again. You seem young so i can understand why you dont like 2d.
Nice shout out to Wario
You are a big inspiration to me Scott, hopefully one day I blow up like you😝💕
Do a switch stop clollab
I want 2D's back...
Goemon erasure all over the place in this video. 10/10
Nobody has ever heard of Viewpoint on the Neo Geo (hey, Scott. Might wanna give this one a go, just to give this game at least some ounce of notability and merit.)
Nope, I have never practiced speaking to anyone before, ever. Hell, when I was in college I would wing every speech I was required to do and I always made the grade. Talking to people is easy enough as long as you can find a connection to your target audience.   Question- Would you consider haptic feedback a rudimentary 4d? The Switch marble test is pretty wild and I love the PS5 triggers with games like Ratchet & Clank. I don't know if I would call them revolutionary or game changing but they are neat. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy a game on one console over another just for the haptic feedback alone. In all honesty other than the haptic feedback I prefer the Series X controller over the PS5's.  Addendum- The reason handhelds are not held in higher regards has nothing to with sales my friend. Think about it this way...why do people prefer to go see a film at an IMax theater than a normal chain? They want the "full" experience and will pay more for it as a result and that's for the same product. I myself have never really been into the handheld scene. The games are 99.9% last generation (or more), shorter experiences, less intricate, never in 4K@60FPS HDR10 w/Ray Tracing...you get the point and that's okay. I would rather spend my hard-earned money on what I consider the definitive versions of games and guess what...there are plenty of PC only gamers that would chuckle at this post. No matter how good a game looks/plays on my Series X and PS5 the top PC guys run games well past 120FPS at 8K resolutions.
i bet he is a variant from spider verse
I did it! I watched every Scott the Woz video to date.  Now what?
Scott as Sony CEO on E3: Heyall SCott here and we sony announce our next broing console
I generally prefer 2d games but I'm pretty sure it's just cuz I'm old and live snes or genesis and was always a massive handheld fan. Hence why I haven't touched my ps4 since I got my switch whihc I now have 650 games for. 400 of which are retro arcade or otherwise indie games.
I used to think meteoid Vania was better 2d until darksoild. Cuz let's be real it's basically a metvania
Isn't this that fuck who owns Sonic Jam
I love Playing Xbox's Iconic exclusive, Cuphead, on my PS5
I like both 2d and 3d. Great video
Humanity peaked at Frogger 3D, we're declining now.
What's crazy to me is that arguably the two best metroidvania games ever made are not Metroid or Castlevania.
2D game having more mass appeal is kind of bullshit at this point. The vast majority of the best selling games ever are 3d. As much as the wii made you think that grandmas are the majority, the numbers say otherwise buddy....
Doom was more influential to 3d movement than Mario 64 was even if it wasn't true 3d.
I'm super excited for Dread, I've dusted off my 3DS to play samus returns and I'm always eventually returning to bloodstained despite having a baller of a PC and both Mordor games in my steam library   Games now that aren't made for 2D certainly want you to look at all the pretty stuff and take advantage of what can be rendered over making a game sometimes, a lot of 3D games still don't let you explore or do much and have a laser focus on narrative, as opposed to the "metroidvania" ilk of 2D that's always allowing you to explore whatever you can until you don't have the ability to pass certain things
WHY R THERE BLUE LINES AROUND DA VID
I think the revival of 2D might have also been helped by the boom of 2D flash games on the web. Developers like nitrome made some great stuff around that time
I get the feeling scott was the class clown back in high school
I agree with not putting certain labels on games, but I think "Download only" would be a fine label to keep, because sometimes I like to see if a large game is download only or not.
And then 64 DS hit the scene.
Was waiting for a Yooka Laylee shoutout...wasn't disappointed!
Scott out here solving every inequality issue but only with Xbox 360 games ; v ;
0:00 Hello, Peter
This makes me want to watch you play The Hex. It’s a video game fans game.
Scott, no! Don't tell them we'd pay more for 2d, we're not made of money ya know?
13:25 JOIN THE OCCULT, DAD!
I have argued for 20 years that I find cut scenes and exploration so frustrating. I work and have a family,  so when I play a video game,  I want to PLAY a game.  If I want a story,  I read a book or watch a movie.   And frankly,  you can do both.  Portal 2 and Celeste are examples from their respective genres that have non stop gameplay and a compelling story.
"The only person that would care about them would be Lincoln and, he's dead"  Howard Lincoln, chairman of Nintendo of America between 1983 and 1999, is still alive.  But anyway, a big reason 2D games appeared to vanish is because Bernie Stolar, in charge of the first PlayStation in the US, hated them, so the many 2D games being released for it in Japan tended to stay in Japan. Then he moved to Sega and decided the best thing to do is kill off the 2D power house that was the Saturn long before it was ready to be phased out in Japan. Sega then fired him. Still, Stolar wasn't alone in this view. The arcade games that were getting the most attention and making the most money were the 3D ones.
No don't let them know that I would've paid 60 bucks for sonic mania, then they'll actually do it!
I would totally love for Scott to play the Finder Love games on PSP, especially after he played The Guy Game on og Xbox
Scott, you should lift, bro. get buff
1:52 Is this what happens when Mario gets Shadow the Hedgehog's edge?
2d gaming is pretty cool
I hate people of coler
As if "The Shake Dimension" isn't as offensive as "Shake It" lol 😂
whats that game at 9:45?
Great video like always
This was a really elaborate Metroid dread ad well done ;)
Is there such a thing as too many 2D games
We are no longer segregating video games nice
This.
AND ANOTHER
SCOTT THE WOZ FROM FRIDAY NIGHT FREKINS!!!111!!1
what zelda track is playing at the end?
I love it that 2D games are coming back in style. Not to say that there is an awesome 3D games because there are a lot of games now that I love. And I think 3D is still going to be dominant in this generation. But 2D games are coming back. I have a lot of 2D games on my switch rather if it's collections of old games like the Castlevania collection and the Contra collection as well as the turrican collection and new to the games that are coming out like gun Lord as well Razion Ex that's coming out for the switch in a couple days and there's probably more and forgetting the name of but I love TD games and that's what turned me on to the switch knowing that I could play all my old games or some of them
Pleaase do more n64 content
What
Steam on PC was also a huge boon for 2d games as well in 2007 and onward. Not only that but the entry to put your game on Steam was way easier than any of the console counterparts and also cheaper too. Just seems like an oversight not to mention it when it was one of the most important things to the current boom of 2d games. MS, Sony and Nintendo were VERY picky with what games got released for years while Valve eased up and let anyone put what they wanted on Steam
Another thing that forced publishers to make specifically 3d and ditch 2d is because Sony forced publishers to make 3d games for their console since Sony wanted to show what their console was capable of. PS1 was also super successful which influenced more to drop 2d completely. For example Capcom held Resident Evil 2 hostage unless Sony let them release Megaman X4 and other 2d games
RPG Footage... in a Scott The Woz video... What Sorcery is this?!?
2:51 SCOTT SHOWED KLONOA OH MY GOD
ONIMUSHA TACTICS?!  How did I not know about this?!🙀
14:49 Nothing more needs to be said
5:00 love the master system throwback
PLEASE what is the song at 8:45 from… its been about 30 years since ive played some of these and its driving me CRAZY cuz I cant place it.  Please someone help!
Narrorator scott: and thats the fourth dimension! Scott: *GHIHUGUGUHFVDHCXWGFZAZG*
Aaahh, scott... You wanna google what it truly means for something to be 4D.. VR games are more real-ler 3D but there is no 4 dimensional reality warping stuff in any upcoming tenchnology within our range
AWESOME
My volume: 24%  Scott: "and another and ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHERAND ANOTHERRNDMDNSNSNSS"  My neighbor: *files noise complaint*
Right. Because I saw her on screen, I have to ask. How is Klanoa pronounced?  Kla-noah? Klone-a? klanooooooooooooow?
Why should the 2D titles cost more? The better answer is that the 3D titles should cost less
I’m not sure I realized just how many 2D games, especially indies, I’ve played. I’ve played almost every 2D indie you showed and could name all of them.
This video just reminded me that I actually own Warioland: the Shake Dimension on the Wii. Totally forgot about that game.
I’m telling my kids that Scott once uploaded 2 videos in a week.
So you could say 3D or you could say 64.
Kinda sad pokemon got onto the 3D hypetrain as well. Just imagine the beautiful spriteart we could have now
Also the PC had descent and Quake 1 came out the day before Mario 64. Plus the PS1 was out two years before Mario 64 came out so it's hard to say it really defined 3d gaming. It was important for 3rd person games but it wasnt really the first decent looking 3d game
People are saying Metroid dread isn't worth it since it isn't 3d. I despise humanity
P
I like this video. Would you like to add a Chinese substitle please?
I'm so glad you put that Hercules game for a second there. I freakin beat that thing so many times.
Then there's the games that break past the 3d barrier by 2 dimensions, like 5D chess with multiverse time travel.
Next up: The Fall and Rise of the L Button
Please please please do a video on Balan Wonderworld! That would be hilarious.
Is this fella related to Norm the gaming historian?
Quake 1 came out a day earlier than Mario 64 and yet Mario 64 steals the limelight for the grandfather of 3D gaming. Descent 2 also had a head start. I wonder if it was due to the 3rd person perspective of Mario 64? More open world? Quake had a hub similar to the Princess' castle. Anyway, I just find it interesting.
Omori
While I get Scott's point about perceived value, let's just take a moment to realize he was vouching for making games more expensive.
and now peppa pig is coming to xbox. and peppa is also 2D.
"Mario isn't the first 3D game but it might as well be". Why so? Duke Nukem 3D and Quake (which is the first true 3D game to, put it simply, be playable at decent framerates). Mario 64 is just like Duke Nukem 3D (3D environment mixed with 2D sprites always facing the camera to make it look like they weren't paper-thin) but was released 6 months later, just sayin'. Anyway, Look up Quake Engine if you're interested in some gaming History. This video *really* isn't it. Mario64 is just the first 3D Mario game on Nintendo's first 3D-capable console. Nothing really astonishing or revolutionary except for the fact that it is a genuinely very good game and excellent 3D take on an iconic character.
I’m so sad cause my friend won’t play many games I’m recommending cause they’re 2D :(
DKCR is one of my favorite games of all time. It has super grounded mechanics and the worlds are so much fun.
I actually liked that games on the 360 were labeled as Arcade or Indie games. That orange banner made me far for likely to check out the game.
Okay, this might be embarrassing to admit but, what the hell, I'm already making a comment on youtube: I'm shameless. I'm very new to gaming, I didn't grow up with consoles or handhelds. So camera systems are a bitch for me to learn. Having a fixed perspective or one controlled by the game is very intuitive and lets you focus on just learning/playing the damn game. Now, I recognize that for many games these days learning how to use your camera effectively is part of the game and you just gotta get over it. But I just wanted to say that it's nice to hear someone way better at games than me acknowledge that camera systems are an added complication. Yes, they can really make you feel part of the world and enable you to do cool shit with aiming weapons and strategizing, but they're also frustrating and complicated sometimes. So, thank you for saying that.
im shocked to see fucking oddworld in a scott the woz video, i feel complete
@5:44 Scott, Super Mario Land 2 isn't the counterpart to Super Mario Bros 2 (USA). SMB2USA released in 1988. SML2 released in 1992, after SMB3 (1988 JP, 1990 US) and SMW (1990) had released. It's closer to SMW which benefited from being a pack in title and sold 20,610,000 units. That's a lot more than 11,180,000.
It’s a shame that the whole “2D games have less value than 3D games debate” resulted due to the lack of interest in big, triple-A 2D games. As a result, they were seen as either cheap indie or handheld/mobile games and were priced accordingly to that idea. But now that 2D games have finally gotten a resurgence, you have Metroid Dread, the first console 2D Metroid game since Super Metroid, as well as the first brand new 2D Metroid game in *19* years. And yet there’ll be chuckleheads who argue the game isn’t worth $60…because it’s 2D. Not because of its quality or the series its attached to, which literally shaped a subgenre, but because it’s lacking an extra dimension. Honestly, this’s probably the most shallow and surface level way to judge a game’s value to me, even more so than its length. Being that, as I said, I can somewhat understand it due to most 2D games not too long ago being either indie or cheap downloadable games. But when buggy, rushed and/or bare-bones 3D games such as Cyberpunk 2077 and Balan Wonderworld can be sold for $60, I think Metroid Dread deserves to be as well.
3D gaming is fine but I'm stuck back in the 16 bit days. I can't help it
If I had a dollar every time a reviewer told me "Mario 64 revolutionised 3D gaming and set the standard for 3D gaming" i would be dead
Scott how dare you say 2D are limited to the amount of things you can do when Terraria, A $10 GAME EXISTS!?
4:15 C'mon Dad!
Kudos to gamefreak giving handheld gaming that love and orgasms.
I totally forgot there was an era of gaming where 2D was seen as lesser. I'm so used too the beautiful indie 2D titles that I just think it's a style choice now
and now its all openworld crap with endless levelling up and pretty much useless perks and crafting that takes forever to get the right ingredients to make something more useful than a pocket knife But dont be sad Metroid Dread is comming soon too kick all that boring crap in the ass for good :D
Ok Scott, when are you gonna do a video about the sheer amount of modern 8bit games being made?  It sometimes annoys me when developers do it, because so many other people have already done it.   Yes I know it's cheaper and easier to make. But really, you can't think of a different art style?
1:26 - the boys at Videlectrix would like a word with you
i’m a subscriber again :D
On "true" 4D gaming: there's _Miegakure,_ an as-yet-unreleased game with four spatial dimensions. It's a bit of a mind-bender to work with (try imagining how a 2D creature would see us!)
Nothing better then some Scott with scotch
Miekagure is a 4D game.
Meanwhile terraria
No no no, Scott, you don't understand. Cheaper, less pricey 2D games is good because then we can all buy 5 copies of Sonic Mania
all nintendo heard from this was "they want 2d games to also cost $60"
Shame, this didn’t include Scott’s thoughts on WayForward’s “A Boy and His Blob” for Wii. I’ll allow it, but only if it’s because Scott’s doing a one-hour long-form review of that game and its revolutionary dedicated “Hug” button.
I'm still angry that Kirby's Epic Yarn got a port to the 3DS. That game deserved a proper HD version, not a port to a dead handheld.
Ok  this was the first video to expose me to the klonoa remake on the Wii, and how it flopped and got the remake of the second cancelled, now in super burnt. Klonoa 2 was one of the first games I ever played and is an amazing franchise, I wish we could see it again
11:00 (funny gun)
9:30 His laugh sounded precisely like that bunny from the trailer of the Petter Rabbit 2 movie.
Scott slandering Sonic 3D Blast has me crying and shaking...
The secret is Battlezone's 3d was military hardware in the 70s.  Those Vectrex games somehow feel like their own dimensional quality. Damn retro tech.
"Is this moonshine or porn?". A question I've never considered until now.
I recall hearing rumors about how there were Japanese games that never got released in English because Sony America was very anti 2d in the ps1/ps2 days.  They didn't want their console to seem underpowered from what I recall reading and only really made exceptions for major publishers like capcom or konami.
Scott the Woz. You the gaming man. You should come on our podcast to talk all sorts of things about gaming. You are like a guru for gamers and game knowledge.
I'll never forget how I felt the first time I saw SM64 in person...I was 6 and it was what dreams were made of.
The comparison between 2D/3D and Bnw/colour film is so accurate. I only hope that we get a bnw resurgence like we have with 2D gaming. The Lighthouse was so fucking good! Just because it's "older tech" doesn't make it lesser damnit
Holy fuck scott the woz.
Funny how most of the 3DS line up are 2D games.
I beat X7 the day this video came out and X8 yesterday, the fact I knew absolutely nothing about the X series and suddenly I'm seeing it everywhere is really weird
I love me some 2d games, but obviously if it’s cheaper to produce it should be cheaper to purchase
5:16 I didn't care, yea I had my PS2 but I also loved the hell out of my GBA too. I remember 20 years ago, it was the best Christmas. My brothers and I got the PS2 and I  myself got a GBA personally. It was the best and I enjoyed all the GBA games I would get over the years.
Man, I should play mario odyssey again, just too lazy
While I think this is a very good video just a small insight to the 90s as you yourself mentioned you weren't there (bonus points for acknowledging it)   The move to 3d being primary wasn't  necessarily the companies wanting it to be that way. You need to think of what happened in the early 90s that sparked the consumers interest in 3d graphics.   The movie industry played a very big role in it. Most notably with movies like Terminator 2, Jurassic Park, Toy Story.   It was the consumer/community perception of graphics that was the downfall.   Thankfully over time said people have changed there views and have relied graphics don't make a good game.   Remember when Virtua Fighting 1 came out it was a marvel of what could be done   Sadly for the most part in the movie industry the effects are still very heavy CGI and things like practical effects are deemed as "dated"   If a company could full on crack there effects in their games the same way how T2 did then DAMN! - T2 used stop motion, cell animation, CGI, practical anamatronics and the combination of the lot makes it looks brilliant to this day.
This is a good video to eat cereal to.
It's great that Switch brings back 2D games to the home console.
11:47 Wtf, why is this a trend? I've never seen this before...
some games focus on 2.5d for the games and advertise them as a 3d games
Technically sonic mania was an indie game published by sega
Shush! I like that 2D games are cheaper than 3D.
These 2d games look amazing.  Nintendo is still 👑  I’m playing Psychonauts 2. Even though I love Sonic I would pick Rehab 🤣
Holy fuck Scott the woz
WARIOWORLD IS A REAL THING?
I listen to Scott when I want to fall asleep. I don’t know why hearing about video games brings me comfort.
Hey Scott, I’m Scott! Nice to meet you 😺
Glad to see Animal Royale go on Switch.
Scott is why atheists will continue to be a permanent minority in the United States despite a rise in the "nones".
Alternate title: "Scott whines that games aren't expensive enough"
"2d games were finally making a comeback"  *shows sonic 4*
That was a really good take on the way things are these days, its just quality over quantity.  You want a great classic game, sure it could be 2D.  So be it.  We don't always need the state of the art for good gaming experiences.
Scott is spooderman
I lived through it and I got to where I just accepted 2d would never get a full revalidation.  There was a huge retro library that I hadn't explored so I would just go retro when I wanted 2d while enjoying newer titles and online when it came along.
Is it weird this is what I fall asleep to?
Scott please do an Ohio meet and greet
Scott, what're you mad that you don't have to spend more money for a good game?
good video but the sound mastering is pretty bad.
We have Mario Maker 1 and 2.. but before that i always wanted something like a Super Mario World  but with new and more more levels.. . or one game i wish they did a longer version of is .. Magical Quest Staring Mickey Mouse..  has so much potential
God everytime I see crunchyroll on the wii menu I have a heart attack for no reason
I NEED to watch Scott The Wozz, his content is my junk food, and I can't stop consuming it. help
9:52 What is the name of the game
I know for a fact that Scott is a lot cooler in 2D than in 3D.
megaman network transmission on gamecube, just saying ;P
If the controller shakes does that make it 4D?
I am surprised that Scott did not lean harder into the 3DS putting out a glut of 2D games.   It's called the 3DS!!!  It highlights the lack of stereoscopic 3D gameplay even more. Just making a 2D game "pop" with some depth of field makes very little sense if you are designing a 2D game to keep costs down.   And then there are the mainline Pokemon games on 3DS that only use the 3D effect sparingly, or barely at all.
I hope Scott talks about lego games
Hello
10:27 lets fucking go SCOTT USED A HOLLOW KNIGHT CLIP
can someone tell me what game was on screen at 6:02 please
scott please im begging you make a video on super mario sluggers
0:02
Man's just explained racism
Very good video idea!
Can anyone tell me what the game at 2:39 is called?
alien hominid cameo!!! yoooo :]
games should be priced to $1/hour to a max price of $60
Scott has clearly never seen the Resident Evil 3 nude mod
Now every tired indie game has to be some pixel rpg or platforms. Unpopular opinion indie games suck
What I don’t get about this, especially with the New Super Mario games is that for a so called casual game, they are just SO DARN HARD. Like, how is Grandma supposed to survive this game if I can’t?
10:51. Not for nothing, but apparently The Poltergeist of Borley Forest is almost sold out. Must make it a better movie than Infinity War, right?
I perrfer 2d games but they are cheaper to make. No video game should cost $60 they are cheap to make compared to movies so the price of modern games makes no sense.
6:34. Shoutout to the simpsons road rage. The first game i ever owned and played that got me into gaming!
9:47 what the hell is this game's name Please tell me, I have vivid memories of it or something like it and I can't remember it's name
Thankfully the Resi 3 remake fell in price pretty sharpish
Can someone tell me the name of the game at 10:38 it looks pretty neat
Camt compare movies. They make their money back on release. Avengers got 2.7billion.. who tf cares for the dvd or blu ray releases?? That's jusy gravy. And a ton of it. Games.. you can re release but lets be honest.. sales are miniscule. Dont think any have come close or barely to 1mil copies EVEN if theyre cheap to 10 15 bucks over 60.   But i do think differentiating makes sense. Definitely helps clear up the price difference. If you want an indie game.. it'll be a "arcade" title or whatevet and its relegated to that portion of the online store. AAA games to another. You cant compare friggin 1985 mario and graphics to friggin gta5 or something. And it creates this large price disparity and quality difference between the two. Heck, parents that dont know any better wont want to spend 60 when theres "perfectly fine" 10 dollar games for the same system. Like wtf, games are games but theres various ones. Thats why you ALSO have your free to play and micro transactions titles or completely free. It all has to be seperated.
This video is pure click-bait Scott (unless that's all you're trying to do nowadays) in the sense you really haven't done your research on this topic, you're trying to 'explain' to your 'gullible' community there was a fall of 2D gaming however was there really?! During the rise of the 3D era in the mid to late 90's & early 2000's 2D games NEVER dropped off, they were just sadly neglected, 2 gaming genres I guess you 'conveniently' left out of the making of this video were that of the Fighting game & Shmup genre (and these games WEREN'T relegated to Handhelds, they were on home console), series like Street Fighter 3, King of Fighters & Guilty Gear, also Shmups like Ikaruga, Gradius 5, Silpheed: TLP, R-Type Final, these games & series THRIVED on the home market and it's games from this time period have still pushed & influenced Devs to bring out games from those series into the modern day.
Weird how through all the years, Kirby and Yoshi have always stayed in 2D, also weird how they are both my favorite Nintendo series'.
What are you talking about? 2D games never fell.. Yes the gaming industry got hyped when even consoles like the n64 and ps1 where capable enough to create great 3d games on. But both systems got great 2D games in their lifespan and all consoles afterwards did..
Nintendo has been nailing it since the switch release. I'm a proud fan boy once again
I see you as kaden fumble bottem but he cusses
Some people prefer 2d's and others 3d's but real gamers only prefer.....    Deez Nuts! Got em!
19:16 Hey, I have seen that game before but I can't remember the name and Google has failed me, Can anyone help?
19:11 sonic colors ultimate. i mean why not.
do u know enzo kennedy?
Will people judge me if I say that I want another main line 2d Mario game from Nintendo?
During the PS2/Xbox era I frequently heard that Sony (at least SCEA, not so much in Japan) actively discouraged game developers from producing 2D games on the PS2, which is one of the reasons there are so few of them from that era.
The same thing about the rise and fall and then rise again of 2D games can be said with rpg table top games. With 3rd edition of dungeons and dragons it was well received but around the end of the edition people got bored and went to games like WoW or any other mmorpg. Wizards of the coast noticed that and made 4th edition heavily video game like which directly caused people to either love it or hate it, if you mentioned you’re a fan of rpg table top games, people would’ve given you a weird look. Now with 5th edition there’s a bit of a revival of rpg table top games, there’s so many games to choose from such as Warhammer 40K, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Call of Cthulhu. Not to mention how popular its gotten with main stream media like Matt Mercer’s Critical Role or Stranger Things portrayal of the Demogorgan (who looks like nothing to what the show shows him as). Table top rpg’s have hit a high point rn, and I’m happy that people are starting to enjoy them for the first time.
I find it funny that Nintendo constantly changes their controller layout and makes 40 different peripherals for their consoles and yet they nearly piss themselves if they step out of 2D platformers for too long.
If someone could tell me what this game is I would be a very happy man. 9:51
What you said is only partly true. A 2D game is not necessarily more accessible and simple than a 3D game. It’s just a fixed viewing perspective.  A 3D game is only really using its 3D aspect if you are traversing an environment from the first or third person. Which is immersive and exciting. But it limits your view to what is directly in front of you. You can’t see what is behind you. This is quite limiting from a design perspective. Yes you could make any kind of hame in 3D but sometimes the fixed perspective makes that challenging like say for a strategy game.  2D games are not necessarily cheaper to develop. Anyone can knock out a game in Unity or whatever but if you want to make an attractive game it takes skilled artworkers and animators.  The success of your game depends on your ability to make a fun game. A 3D platform game is more difficult to make fun than a 2D game due to the difficulty of judging distances from that perspective.  But a 2D action game is less limiting than a 3D game just because you have an overview of the action. The action and interactions with the world in 3D is just more awkward.  Hotline Miami would not be as good in 3D. Bit of as much money was spent developing a game without the use of polygons it had the potential to be more visually arresting than the same game made using polygons simply from the processing power moving from calculating geometry and lighting onto other special effects.  Sculpture did not make paintings obsolete.
Youtube's mediocre notification system gave me the notif 3 days after this came out
12:13 what game is that?
The more Ds the better
anybody know what the game is at 18:12? It looks awesome
Can You Go Make Even More Originals Later Please?
Why is super mario sunshine in the thumbnail if this is about 2d games?
The reason why Kirby is 2D on the N64 is because the bosses over at Hal Labs didn’t want it
Games shouldn't be $60 anyways
CrossCode. 2D zelda in gameplay feel, BotW in scope (price value). Demo still up on newgrounds (and unaffected by the death of flash) that will instantly tell consumers what to expect. You will either fall in love with the game, or recognize its value while realizing it isnt the game for you. Heck, it is even on the Switch, meaning you can get your choice of handheld or console experience. I cant give it enough praise, and it along with hollow knight are the reasons i can recognize the potential of 2D beyond just the "cheaper to produce, lower quality game" stigma.  To describe CrossCode beyond the surface, take a 2D zelda game (not zelda 2), give link a megaman blaster, make charge shots ricochet, then use that ricochet in nearly every puzzle the game has to offer. Put the player in a fake MMO world filled with fake players running about, party members who talk about both the game world and their offline lives, and all the sidequests and meta humor that comes with an MMO and the players you would talk to. Add environmental puzzles all about properly navigating the 3ish layers of the world, and wrap it up in the story of the main character both separate and connected to the game world. Any more details get deep into spoiler territory.
I'm defo played some 2D game that in my opinion have more content and quality than some of the big 3D game  I mean, been playing Hollow Knight recently, and my god, you could charge a normal full price and I wouldn't complain, and don't get me started with the fact that all DLC are free
10:38 What game is that?
Dread isnt being denounced got being 2d it's being shit on because its 12 years late and looks like something that would be great looking in 2011
Why tf are you vouching to raise the price of games?
I feel 2D games focus more on function while 3D games focus more on feel. Arlo originally said it but that was really towards Zelda games but I feel to an extent that can apply to games in general not just Zelda games.
Genuinely the most thoughtful gaming channel out there. Scott you rock!
Nice!!!!!
this video was literally the first time i’ve actually seen warioland 3d gameplay
19:17 that game he got footege from looked interesting what was it
Scott: Mischeif Makers... Me: ITS CANON SCOTT FALCO AND SCOTT THE WOZ ARE THE SAME PERSON!
it's puzz to woz
Living thru this was torture, once Nintendo realized that 2D platformers still had huge drawing power (like around the Wii U) is when things got better.
There is a 4D game. 5D Chess with Multiverse Time Travel (yes the game called 5D Chess only has 4 dimensions)
13:23 Mario 64 is a lot more anti-casual than Mario Sunshine though. What he said about grandma playing Mario Galaxy is funny tho.
Here’s to hopes for a sequel to Sonic Mania, Megaman 12, and another blast of a Donkey Kong Country title. However, I do hope they don’t fall into the trap that Kirby and the New Super Mario Bros titles have.
I don’t know who this Scott the Woz guy is but if he’s anything like the guy who owns Sonic Jam then I’ll watch!
I'd buy Metroid Dread for $70...  oh wait, I bought it for $90 with the Special Edition.  Oops!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Scott: breathes   Me: 😂😂😂😅🔥🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣(smashes the like button)
Personally I attribute pricing based on how much most people are willing to buy. 2D games having lower prices isn't a bad thing in my opinion, it only helps it sell more. And hey, I love Sonic Mania and think it's a great game, but it'd be ridiculous to me if it was a full $60. It's not about quality, it's about production costs, length (I beat Sonic Mania in a day or two), and again, appeal. A more simplistic game will sell better for cheaper prices. Like you said, they're good for just picking up, and playing. High prices would kind of just go against that in my opinion. Anyways, that's just my take though, and for the record, I wouldn't mind $60 for a game like Dread, that's basically just a AAA game that happens to be 2.5D in my opinion and something I consider different than Sonic Mania, which, while great, is something you mostly just play to have a good time moreso than paying attention to the story. K rant over but great vid regardless lol
Tbh I always kinda attributed formerly handheld games appearing on Switch to the Switch's handheld hybrid nature.
18:11 Yooooooo actually what game is this
tootie games
Scott wtf man... why do you want 2d games to be more expensive? i like that 2d games are cheap,so i can buy more of them,don't take that away from me man...
I can't believe how long it's taken me to realize how good 2d games still are. I dropped out of them around middle school but now have rediscovered my love for them
Scott should write the textbook on video game history
I have to disagree with you Scott. Unfortunately I’m not making that YouTube money like you are, so having 2D games and indie titles be cheaper and more affordable than 3D and third party games works better for me. It’s one of the reasons why I haven’t played octopath yet and chose to spend my $60 on BoTW. It’s just way too expensive for me and it’s a safer purchase since I’m an already established Zelda fan. I couldn’t afford my switch until this past March of 2021 as well. Feel free to get a discussion going in the reply’s of my comment, but keep it civil!!
So many games use 3D for no real reason, often to the detriment of the game, many games (especially RTS games) don't need to be in 3D as unless you actually use that Z axis, its just a gimmick that'll make things harder to read and slower to run.
Memes aside, I like how Scott can stay positive about games/gaming. It gets really cynical everywhere else imo.
Ironically 2D fighters are making a big comeback even though they had been on the decline for many years now😕
The Xbox arcade gave me major nostangia, stop reminding me the good days of life are over.
I still know several people who look down on indies regardless of 2d or 3d   Its so strange 🤷‍♂️
10:13 WAIT THE SWITCH HAS LEGO HARRY POTTER??!?!?
Exactly a reason why everyone swept Kingdom hearts chain of memories under the rug and regretted it because it's actually part of the story. Everyone thought it was a GBA spinoff.
9:07  When you take out a loan to jumpstart your prostitution career but you can't pay off the debt.
I get simulation sickness.  God bless all those developers that still make 2D games.
Got some Gray Whale Gin there.
What Scott doesn't mention is that the 2D revolution actually started a year before 2005. Cave Story. And around the same time you had Within a Deep Forest, Knytt, the Remar games...with the indie boom came the loud return of 2D.
"Guess what happened" I thought the first and only GTA entry on a Nintendo platform was Chinatown wars on DS. This is the first I hear of GTA GBA.
I love that you showed Tomba.
Not a big fan of FFVIIR I see
I think at the time, the transition from 2D to 3D was more seen as an evolutionary thing, because let's be honest, being able to play games in 3D was truly an amazing thing. But as you mentioned, since 2D and 3D games are now more of their on genres instead of being seen as an "transition", then now both genres have a shot at showing what they got now, and I'm happy for the Indie Dev's and just 2D gaming companies because their games won't be seen as less then anymore, or at least not to the majority of gamers now.  I'll be honest though, I much prefer 3D over 2D. 3D games just make the characters and the game's environment/worlds much more better and detailed then a 2D game could, and I'm more of the person to play a game for it's story and characters rather then it's gameplay, so I've no problem with the "huge amount of cutscenes" in 3D titles, I actually really like them as it usually shows more of the characters and their bonds with each other then a 2D game could.
Games like 3D Metroid and Mario are fun but some franchises are just better in 2D due to its simplicity.
ive beat hotline miami 1&2 and celeste this year and they more fun than any 3D game ive played this year with the mild expectation being persona 4
Hear me out on keeping 2D games cheaper than 3D games: I could afford them. XD
broke - they should make indie games $60 like triple A games  w o k e - make all games $20ish max
No LittleBigPlanet?
Scott! please make your audio levels normal/the same. I constantly have to turn up and down my volume because I can't hear you and then my ears bleed. thank you!!!
These jokes are hitting as hard as a blind guy with no arms.
wish they brought back viewtiful joe
There was a similar 3D/2D battle being fought specifically with racing games. Are you gonna be polygonal, ugly and slow but with decent physics and tasting like the future, or sprite based, beautiful and fast but without any kind of physics? This was primarily on consoles, but I remember both coexisting for a while.
Scott I dare you to talk about soap
I think we also need to mention the resurgence of console 2d games has a lot to do with the downward trend of the handheld
"The 3ds had to much 2d" Well shit
No more video game racism
minecraft: am i a joke to you
4D is time
Loved these games
3D isnt ways an "upgrade" just ask anime fans
Oh right Terraria is a 2-D game
As a massive computer games fan it’s so amazing to see the huge variety of games here. Thank you Scott
I played Warioland Shake it as a kid. It was very good.
The Gameboy Advance was fucking awesome.
2D games don't deserve to be priced at $60 for a multitude of reasons. - 2D games nowadays are made in 3D game engines with 3D models. They are only kept 2D because its a million times easier to design a 2D title. - There are far better 2D games for half the price. - 2D games are significantly less costly to produce than 3D games.  Nintendo selling their 2D games at $60 is extremely greedy--especially when they're either years-old ports (Tropical Freeze) or aren't very good (Kirby Star Allies).
It is a shame whenever a game gets treated badly just for being 2D or having "bad graphics"
10:39 what’s the name of the game?
It's not that 2d games are worth less then 60+ dollar games. It's that alot of games shouldn't cost $60+ dollars to begin with. These last few generations have been bloated with multiple ways to make money off games and the prices of the "base" games are are still going up. And in Nintendo's case it feels like a lot of these titles are $60+ simply because their first party and the switch has broken the $40 max price for handheld games due to being a hybrid.   Metroid Dread appears to be using the same engine and gameplay style as Samus Return's on the 3ds but costs $20 more.
Hello, I am from Ireland in Europe, and I was very offended by the amount of times Scott said “shake it” in this video
I can never hear 2.5D without thinking of the Caddicarus clip.
What was the game at 2:46?????
1:28 I booted up this video while listening to some Mega Man music on Spotify...and was in the middle of listening to Toad Man's theme when it showed up on here. Scott made this happen. No other explanation. Scott is a deity confirmed.
1d gaming is the future
Great video. I love 2D platformers, they're my fave genre. Great point about the price, however its not that 2D games are undervalued, its that big AAA games are massively overpriced. I don't pay more the £30 for a game EVER, regardless of genre. £20-30 that's what I expect to pay and that's it.
I don't understand the Super Mario Brothers lore. I just can't get it straight.
Metroid video when?
What were you saying about Super Paper Mario???  *sad Dimentio noises*
I've been bored of all the current games, and have been playing metroidvanias. Hollow knight, Grime, Ender Lillie's, Axiom Verge I and II. I submit to you that 2D games are the best games being made right now.
what’s that game at 11:30
That swing at Kirby Star Allies
you changed scott, the madden slander??? it should be worth whatever they need
I have a small rule: if it movies anything 3D it the way to go, but seems as a flaw since streaming site came. And games 2D I like the cartoon look of stuff.  And if you saying 3D that meaning you saying the 3ds. Which is name after that. And 3D never make much different form gameplay. But if you speaking pitchers way then ya 3D look.  Think it should go too: 1 year I’d gaming just drawing or 1D,  2 year of games games not just drawing they look like art form a gallery or 2D,   3 year of gaming 3D suck form Nintendo boy but 3D comes along on ds and all loss there minds,  4 year seeing games is a thing or 4g or 5d.  And final 5 year of gaming system grow in look settings while arcade die but then stream comes. Years I mean but gaming of stages snd frogot 1900mgame crash that should be in 2d year.  NEXT TIME LOOK UP THE MEANING OF STUFF! HINT lIKE COVID, LOOK FACTS AND THEN GET IT TO END THIS RAGE OR GET MASK AND A LIFE!  KEEP ALL CAP IN YOUR MIND! 😡😡😡😡😡
what game is he showing at 11:12
2D games shouldn't be $60, but neither should 3D games
Dude the GBA Metroid games are SO good my goodness
Woah woah woah what’s going on with Scott’s hair?
The modern dk country games are masterpieces
Dont you be forgetting chibi robo ziplash
Babe wake up new Scott the Woz video
Keeping the indie part, but not 2D...Astoneer releases on switch next year!!!
Why does your PS1 have a tumor? Is this an NTSC thing? The PAL one is flat on the top, both models.
It still amazes me how Romancing SaGa 3 (and Scarlet Grace) which is by SQEX did such a massive boom in the west with its « remaster », quotation marks on remaster since we never got the original on snes in the west
Glad you showed Klonoa: Door to Phantomille and the wii remake
Please polish my bald head
Nintendo switch accessory video?
scott got a gun prop and just REALLY wanted to show it off
Look up the graphics of Monkey Island 3 and 4 and tell med 3D graphics weren't a mistake.
Perform "why don't you play them" at your family reunion.
2D or 3D I don't care, I just wanna play good games.  By the way Metroid II is my favourite Metroid game cause you could explore to your heart content and run away from Boss fights.
Technically, Doom and Wolfenstein are also in 2d, but they use a smart trick to make you believe its 3D. And technically the original Quake came before Mario 64 and that was also true " 3d" . But yeah the blue print for 3rd person games was done in Mario 64.
No game is worth $60-70.  Not a single one.  They make all their money on micro-transactions, and even if they didn't have those, they could cut CEO pay and still make a profit selling 500k copies at $40.  Any game.
Totally forgot that he was doing a family reunion bit XD
What’s the game at 2:37? I’ve been looking FOREVER for that game.
I want to waluigi‘s mansion that's a stiff bit flowy version of Warioland shake dimension. a clean 2D platformer staring the purple boi
I love happy endings
11:00
Cuphead was literally the only reason I bought an Xbox
8:08 WHAT GAME IS THIS OMG I PLAYED IT AS A KID ON THE 360 I CANT REMEMBER WHAT ITS CALLED
Did he just argue that 2D game should be more expensive?...
I absolutely love the 2d Pokémon games and kinda wish they would return to the BW type sprites at some point
my two favorite games of all time are Undertale and Celeste, 2D games. Sonic Mania was an incredible experience and Hollow Knight is sure to be one once i get back to playing. modern 2D gaming is so good, man
"What is this, moon-shine or porn?"
For fun, imagine he's saying "Tooty" the whole video.
Yo Scott, if you hate Apple so much why not just switch to Windows?
Not trying to hate but, anyone else feel like scott's scripts are starting to feel repetetive? (not the topic of each video, but rather what he says about that specific topic)
9:50 yo what is this game i think i had it on my blackberry tablet when i was 6 and i need to know
Me: oh another scott the woz video  Me at 12:02: HAAAATTT!!!
Regarding the price debate, I think 2d games are wayyy more fairly priced. 3d usually just gets the "AAA so 60/70 bucks" treatment, but 2d games come in all sorts of scopes with appropriate price ranges.  For the most part (looking at you Link's Awakening).
Prince of Persia Sands of Time is a 4D game
I'd argue you were still right with VR being 4th dimension. There is a wide variety of haptic feedback equipment for it now.
YEAH SCOTT ACKNOWLEDGED BALLZ!!!
I actually owned Wario Land: Shake It! It was a good time and I definitely recommend it.
If my chair moves that the fourth dimension  Background: eaahhhhhh!
I’m concerned for Scott since he has had a gun pointed at him like twice in 1 episode.
Sonic colors for the DS i is underrated
I think hd photo-realistic games should be considered separately as a step further in sophistication from just 3D - you can make a blocky stylized 3D game on a budget, but realistic imagery and physics demand lots of money. I believe that's the reason classic JRPGs went extinct on consoles in 2005 - advent of hd made them unreasonably expensive to make. That evens out now too.
I just want to say, I don't think 3D games are worth $60 95% of the time, don't go telling 2D games they need to be $60 too!
Hello Scott Woz i’m a very available single from ohio (much like yourself) Tips hat. 🥺
Can Scott talk about the downfall of atari that would be a nice vid
13:25 Scott the Woz saying dad sounds like someone from Tennessee saying dad
Imagine a video where scott talks about rhythm games for an hour
Mortal Kombat tried 3D for a while. But since MK9, they've been strictly 2D... And the series is better off for it!
Some games should just stay in 2D like Earthworm Jim.The 3D version killed the series.
Nintendo in Wii U and 3DS with 2D Games: yes
I'm both upset and sad you didn't at least acknowledge homestuck / undertale and their consequences and gains for indie 2d gaming.
If you wanna see a 3D game made from 2D sprites, check out Asterix and Obelix XXL on GBA; it looks like a home console game shrunk down to fit on a handheld! (I know it might sound dumb, but you should see the gameplay, it looks quite impressive for a GBA game).
1:08 lmao
11:02 This is further proof you are a cinematic genius.
Scott should do a video on the history of indie games!
BUY METROID DREAD.           That's all.
I feel like more 2D platformers should try to aim for a style like the Wario Land Shake it game or even hollow knight with drawn beautiful sprites. I'm kind of at a point where I think seeing pixel art platformers feel bland now unless if they add or mix up the style with interesting lighting or cool backgrounds
Personally I think the new divide were seeing is games that are "Games" & Games that are a bit more than games. I'm really leaning towards the "Gamey Games" lately.
The intro/outro joke really came full circle here!
Scott always repeats himself a bit in his videos, but this one was too much.
I was on board until you started mindlessly gushing about indies
Scott, this is your best video.  Fantastic analysis.    VERY NICE
"What's half a Z?" Welcome to algebra
I like 2d because it is more fast paced. It delivers information quicker and better to the player and that's another reason why it is so popular with handhelds with tiny screens.
And another.
Sounds like Scott is calling out someone here... 20:22
Great analysis, you are a gentleman and a scholar
So much work is being put into these videos that I feel I’m at college thinking with my brain….. ugh
“Hey Scott how you doing”  “2D just kind of popped out of nowhere-“
Man, Scott sure doesn't like ff7r huh
Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero Scott!!! It's 2D as hell!!!
I wish they would give 2D Mario the kind of budget an Odyssey gets. New Soup series didn't feel like Nintendo was really trying, at least ever since it left the DS.
Narrow passages are there because of console limitations, to load the new area. The pc doesn't have that...do your research, its not to make it longer, its a hardware limitation...hope this gen consoles finally got to pc standards.
I was there:P I remember 2D being the lame old thing and 3D was the new hype. It was the future! My first console was the PS2 and I mostly played CRPGs and strategy games for PC before that. So I wasn't part of the first 3d console hype wave, but I knew people who were and by the time I got a console 3D was just there so it felt natural.  what I noticed however was that I actually felt most games in 3D felt worse at the time. Strategy games, especially RTS looked better in 2D and I didn't like a lot of the 3D graphics. They looked blocky and bland, and the controls and 3d camera and angles often didn't work. Many games went for technical progress at the cost of style and polish. To me Age of Empires 2 looks better than Empire Earth ever did and Planescape Torment looks detailed and gorgeous to this date. The only problem they have by modern standards is the resolution.  The first game in 3D that I actually felt looked good and was a step up was Warcraft 3 I think. There were of course great looking games in 3D before that, I just didn't play or knew about them. But for me the first years of 3D when it became the thing every game had to be was generally dissapointing and I didn't care about the hype. I missed the attention to detail and colours that came with 2D and isometric 2D. For a couple of years 2D sprites looked better than 3D polygons
Nintendo: Costs less, sells for more.
i love the small beard
I’m kinda glad 2D games aren’t worth 60$ so I can pay for a good indie game without going homeless
Ori games  Best 2d games since Mario 3
I remember when ps1 came out, I was shocked when 2d games still came out. Laughed at them because I had just left them behind on Genesis.
skott da waz
2D gaming is still down
I remember my first genuine reaction to Super Mario 64, being one of not really ready for the transition to 3D, as I wanted more 2D Mario, lol. Then for a while, it really felt like 3D dominated, and I was surprised and pretty happy to see 2D return from the indie scene, and then from everyone else. At first I felt the 2D revival was fuelled by mainly nostalgia, but there were a lot of titles that felt new and fresh, and it's good to see it's here to stay.
thank you for expressing my feelings on 2d games way better than i ever could
holy fuck it's scott the woz
13:30 69
"JOIN THE OCCULT DAD"  Best Scott The Woz line
10:42 which game is that ?
Fun fact: Doom isn’t actually a 3D game, it’s a 2D shooter. When you pull up the map, that’s ACTUALLY what the game is. There’s smarter people that could explain it better than me so if you wanna know more just look it up.
Anybody knows the game at 9:52 ?
0:05
21:08 what is the game
9:06 oh look it's one of my favourite Scott the Woz moments!
wtf i completely forgot about the opening gag
Thx for the great vid, this video is something I’ve thought about a lot.
Scott the Woz: 2D games cost less than 3D games Klonoa: *hold my X and Y axis*
The DS Zelda games deserve to be overlooked.
"the 2D games just feel like Spin-offs" Kingdom Hearts: Yeah not here
Hi Scott, big fan. Also happen to be one of the Producers of Poltergeist of Borley Forest. Thanks for referencing our dumb movie.
Game at 0:46 please?
Since time is officially recognized as the 4th dimension, it could be argued that any 3D-animated game involving time travel is a 4D game. Additionally, 2D games with time travel could be considered 3D, as they would have length x width x time.
Are there 1 dimensional ga- [Content Deleted]
Scott had a bunch of opportunities to talk about Pokemon here, considering it's one of the biggest franchises to remain in 2D throughout all of this era. Sucks because his examples of 2d were like 90% platformers lmao
I feel this video doesn't work as Scott wasn't even born when games were just 2d, someone talking about an era he never experienced just doesn't feel right to me
woah
My movie theatre was called 9D not kidding
Hi um I’d like to know more about Scott’s cult thanks. Very interested.
13:11 that’s the point. My grandma was playing Tetris and Arkanoid on my NES. My wife likes to play Mario, but only in 2D. She literally  can’t walk straight in games like Assassin’s Creed… So yeah. 2D games are definitely more inclusive.
Can‘t believe he didn‘t show or mention the Ori games even once
I'm a virgin after watching this
I loved warioland shake it, still own it and was debating playing it, think you gave me the reason to play it
A little bit repetitive at some parts, but very good video.
In a perfect world, everything would be just "games"  No price discrepancy, no console exclusives, no company/studio, no 2D/3D, they would all just be seen as games.
alot of the great indi games blend both 2d and 3d so well
The only true 2.5d game is super paper Mario
I love the gun that comes into frame every few skits
How do you capture such clean, clear shots of those Virtual Boy games?
Counter argument:  Few games are actually worth $60, z axis or not.  It may cost that much to produce, but that doesn’t make the experience worth the heavy entry fee.  We may be getting to a point where the expectations of multi-million dollar budgets aren’t realistic.  At least not for a dozen new games a season.  2D games might appeal more to those casual gamers, where the story-driven 3D open world titles are more for hardcore gaming fans.  Which of the two classes is willing to shell out $40, $50, maybe $120 for a special edition?
8:16 🔥
5:40 MY FAV SONIC GAME no matter who says what i played this one as a kid and not the sonic adventure or dx…
Heyya Scott Here
Moron 5d chess. Which is actually 4d don’t ask
I feel like Scott doesn't like cinematic or story based games because the qualities he mentioned that he doesn't like are qualities story based or cinematic games have
Whhooooaaa there Scott. You know developers won’t have a problem making 2d games $60
20:27 Oh no no no. The value isn’t $60, my friends. Try over $10,000,000!!!  Just sayin, too much for one guy, even if it’s Matthews.
11:18 well actually the parts where you are just walking have dialogue making it an interactive cut scene in a way. It's meant to give more character and personality to the characters and further the story. A movie would be weird if they cut out the dialogue between characters and the same thing goes for these cinematic/story games. Don't like it then don't play cinematic/story  games
One of your best videos, well done dude 😎👌
I remember taking issue with the $60 price tag for Link's Awakening on Switch, but then I remember that I take issue with a $60 price tag for games in general and is also the reason I don't own Breath of the Wild either.
Scott talking about how 2d games are valued less inadvertently made the argument that 3d games are overpriced lmao
Interesting as always. Although, 2D games aren't necessarily easier nor cheaper to produce than 3D ones. It depends on a lot of factors, such as their level of details. I think this assumption comes from the fact that anyone can draw 2D, while 3D requires at least a bit of additional knowledge and practice, and also the fact that expectations are way higher when it comes to 3D games.  For instance, it's a weird comparison anyway since the size of 2D and 3D worlds are impossible to compare to begin with, but in terms of games length we can compare Wario Land: Shake It with Wario World, clearly the former required more work. Or Rayman 3 with Rayman Legends, in this case Rayman 3 was probably longer to develop but particularly because of all the cutscenes, varied objectives, etc. while Rayman Legends didn't really need those since it wasn't really expected - in fact it's always weird to have too much of these in a 2D platformer unless they actually bother to include hand-drawn animation. Make Rayman 3 a simple platformer and you'll have a similar production. That also brings up the fact that we're often used to 2D games being shorter and simpler, but very complicated and refined games such as Metroid Fusion have required a whole lot of work, even though the Prime's were even insanely more refined.  Admittedly there's also the fact that a 3D engine is usually way more complicated to program than a 2D one, so it depends what tools are used. But for a random studio which uses external tools, in both cases production requirements simply boil down to what quality they want to reach.
Scott plzzzz tell me ur gonna do a recap and opinion about the PS5 showcase. I wanna know how many knee slaps you would rate it
Oh boy, Scott in his best form in this video. That's grade A Youtube content right there!
Fun Fact: Mega Man X7 and Mega Man Zero 2 released on the same day.  Guess which one had the better reviews.  Guess which one was also the handheld entry.
"3D games were seen as Handheld only" And it’s this mentality that lead some to complain about Metroid dread being priced the same as others home console games (probably because it’s releasing on an home console)
Took a shot everytime he said handhelds made the 2d games feel less important and was drunk in less than 8 minutes.
I need a Gris sequel stat
Scot is damn hilarious. Doesnt need to ad screaming memes to try and be funny!
14:50 you'll thank me later
I prefer 2d games.
2D = gameplay-driven 3D = graphic-driven (In general) I donno, but I prefer gameplay much more than the graphic. I’m playing games, not watching the movies.  I also think that most 3D games don’t have replayability-valued
Want crash bandicoot the first true 3D game?
At first I though "oh, The Poltergeist of Borley Forest is pretty popular I guess, there's only one left in stock." Then I realized... it's probably because there was no reason to make any more... because no one will buy them...
Crash bandicoot is a 4D game The 4th dimension is time
Wow, Scott actually managed to have footage of Chibi Robo Zip Lash onscreen without having a miniature meltdown. Dr. Attricks was right, he's making great progress.
Scott discusses racism.
1:02 but why is it red?! 😲
While 2D has been the preferred realm of indie devs for a long time it's clear that this is changing now, 3D development tools have become much better and more accessible so in the late 2010s and 2020s we've started to see a ton of 3D indie games.
9:21    Why   Why did you show sonic 4      Why      Why
What’s the game at 0:31 ? I used to play it and now I want to look it up!
Holy shit. This is just a big reason why you should by Metroid dread. The genius
Woah it’s Scott the woz
the separate hallway loading screen is genius
PIN ME AND I WILL SUBSCRIBE
I'm just an old gamer, so if you offer 2d or 3d I'll go 2d.
nice flip camera in the background
God Cuphead is a masterpiece. Still waiting on that Cuphead DLC though.. Might just do another playthrough with my buddy while we're waiting!
Maybe a indie horror movie does release with the same price as a high profile one like avengers, but it usually does not sell well, right?  I think most AAA games are not worth the 60$ tag either, however, in a competitive market, a shorter, simpler and cheaper to produce experience is not uncommon to cost cheaper prices, as they should.   So yeah, i miss xbox live arcade and sane prices for these smaller games, indies at least still understand this concept.
I'm incredibly pleased that Scott mentioned Mischief Makers. I'd love to see a video on it!
Ngl paying 60 bucks for a 2d game doesn't feel right
I wonder what my scott would look like in 4d
“I should no I wasn’t there” lol
I think the 2D resurgence had two main factors: New Super Mario Bros being a smash hit, and the rise of indie games. Games like Cave Story and Shovel Knight proved that indie games could be much better than high-budget AAA games, and most indie developers were making 2D games. I think both these factors influenced each other as the years went on.
Well I do care though I am not dead
If you want the Ultimate stuck in the middle try "Don't Starve". Its 2d characters and things but in a 3d world. Its like legend of zelda link between worlds with 2d art
How in the- Metroid 2 outsold super???
to be fair scott, no one likes the ds zeldas
Shhhhhh, be quiet, Scott! We can’t let Nintendo hear this! We need Dread to stay underrated so it stays below $60!
Celeste is probably one of the best games ever made.
DKC Returns and Epic Yarn are classics in my eyes
This is like when Disney went from cartoon films like Lion King to CGI films like Frozen.
Fun fact : racing games are way better in 3D
Scott in 2D would be wearing that hoodie
Credit to Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker for being pushed pretty close to actually being titled the 5th game in the series.
Honestly I'm not exactly too sad about modern 2D games being cheaper.  Getting a great game for less money? Win in my book as a consumer.
I've began noticing that Scott repeats himself a lot
2Deez nuts
Don’t you sit here and badmouth 2d platformer overload while showing donkey Kong country returns. The disrespect! Lol
scott no disrespect but you literally spent the entire video saying the same exact thing on repeat. it’s honestly something i’ve been noticing in your recent videos. just my opinion tho
Ô ! God may forgive all sins , but the sin of not buying dark souls is as bad as sin can get
13:26 17:11 69 coins
Don't Like the take on 2d games should be the same price as 3d ones. There is still a lot more that go into it then a 2d. The problem I feel you want to get across is 3d games are to expensive for what little content is actually in it compared to a 2d game. Again not saying 2d games aren't worth a good price just they shouldn't be the same as a 3d only because it has more playing time.
That intro XD
5:26 I've literally heard several game reviewers here on youtube directly refer to the handheld Zelda games as "spin-offs". Usually lead to a correction in the comments after a bunch of people point that out, but it's shocking to me that it even happens. Especially since a few of those reviewers talk so highly of ALttP when even the GameBoy Color entries were improvements in both gameplay and design. Glad to see you don't make that same mistake, though.
I wish Pokemon would go back to being 2d. It's been rough and getting rougher ever since X and Y
2d games are cheaper and easier thus is cheaper to buy, good idk this is a complaint
Arcade racing games are dead
We love hearing Scott bitch about Nintendo games
The 2D-3D transition of around 1996 was the defining gaming era of my childhood and I’m pretty offended Scott couldn’t even bother being alive during it.
Think it's worth mentioning that of the 6th gen, the Dreamcast actually had quite a few 2D games, even for higher profile projects.
I feel like Scott's testing himself to see how he can shoehorn in New Super Mario Bros Wii
I remember playing the original Grand theft Auto back in 1997 and thinking wow how amazing would this game be in 3D...
scog the waz
The thesis of this video, 2D games are great and I hate how they’re treated as second rate by being less expensive, please raise the price so I don’t pay less for quality games.
yo when he said pay attention i was just starting to stop paying attention it was  so trippy
a 20 minute video defending metroid dread we love to see it
As someone who's shooting a movie for my rock band in black and white (except for a few short animated color sequences), this is definitely relatable. While most major studios stopped shooting films in black and white by 1966 (unless done for artistic reasons), the absence of color has it's advantages and since the late 90's, it seems like a lot of indie filmmakers are shooting films as such for similar reasons as me.
Not having a Z-Axis matters to players for good reason. 2D gaming is highly restrained and you said yourself that for a lot of people those experiences are less memorable. That makes them worth less than 3D games inherently, even if it seems unfair.  Most of the time people complain like this it's not that they think a 2D game isn't going to be worth buying. It's that they *know* the company knows the issue with them being so expensive and is selling it that high to begin with. It's not a knock on the game, it's just anti-corporate-greed.
I love how right now both 2D and 3D gaming are liked and treated and respected equally,my retro gaming collecting ass who also wants the latest AAA games couldn't be happier right now. Got my Switch and I'll try to nab a Steam Deck later on.
I played a game on the game boy color that had a top down perspective similar to Zelda but you could jump and had to do platforming. I thought you could take this idea and make it in to say a Banjo-Kazooie game and it would be super awesome. Unfortunately they did not do something super awesome and each world was just a pallet swap of the previous with like say icy floors added in. Kinda like metroid on 3ds.
18:49 Well yeah, the Switch is the replacement for the 3DS. I don't feel it's a suitable replacement for a dedicated handheld, since it's not nearly as portable or comfortable to hold, but it *is* a handheld system and there's nowhere else for games to go. Nintendo started phasing out the 3DS immediately after the Switch's release. Sure they released the N2DS XL not long after, but that was more of a way to squeeze out a quick budget system and get more sales for their already released games.
There's always one joke in your videos that will make me immediately hit the like button after I hear it, and this video's joke was "Is this moonshine or porn?" Bravo.
sports games aren't worth the discs they come on, ive NEVER bought one, and never will, i wouldn't even if you paid me.
What Mario game is that at 14:30? Looks really cool.
Nintendo right now: *Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.*
It's important to note, when talking about 3D being more popular than 2D, that this mainly applies to platform/adventure experiences. Pokemon, while more popular as a merchandise IP (at least as far as the money shows), has always been a handheld-exclusive series (even now, since the Switch is a hybrid), and even when it came to consoles with Colosseum and XD, it was preferred on handheld by most people (but personally Colosseum is possibly my favorite Pokemon game).
they ARE inferior in value 90% of the time though.......the value that the companies get from them that is, hence the price hikes, they well and truely ARE WORTH only $10 or so, anywhere NEAR full price IS outrageous, but companies are literally made from the collective greed of people....
Yes, graphics.
That divorce settlement  gag made me laugh and cry cause I'm currently  getting divorced 🙃🤣
Honestly I just wish he talked about how the 2D revival basically killed 3D platforming
20:02 Scott really doesn't like story focused games.
What’s the name of the game being shown at around the 6-minute mark (with the guy fighting the dragon)?
Honestly, I really think Cave Story is the game to thank for the 2D revival boom.
I miss the XBLIG era, honestly.
0:42 hd rumble
Gaming going from 2d to 3d is like when we had our tvs from flat to with a slight curve
This guy is dead set on trying to blow people's speakers by randomly screaming.
This is a very educational video edit: .
Finally, Scott says what we've been thinking this WHOLE TIME
3:51  am i the only one who noticed that this is deku link outside clock town without the deku mask on a c button? implying that this footage comes from the glitch that lets you escape early.
You should do an episode on Hollow Knight. It’s honestly one of the greatest games I’ve played and it nearly singlehandedly revitalized the Metroidvannia genre.
omg its idubbbz
If you want a major example of 3D game fluff, especially earlier 3D games before they could be very large in scale, compare Xenogears content for its completion time vs. Xenosaga 1 for its completion time.  One felt like a grand world, the other like 6 or so dungeons with cutscenes.  And both about 60-80 hours
Persona 4 video when?
11:20 yep that sounds like any open world game.
My Friend Pedro is such a criminally underrated game that I feel no one talks about.
Not sure what happened with the script here, but it feels like it you could remove half of it and still get the same points across, so much repetition...
Anyone else notice how much hes saying dad and the fact he was on the dad arg?? Hmm
your 'black and white' vs 'colour' movies comparison was right on the money. its asinine to claim a film is worthless 'because its not in colour'. A great movie is a great movie. and many are great precisely because they worked under specific constraints and within known boundaries, and overcame these limitations via wit, skill, style and substance.
Amazing video, been a while since I’ve watched a Scott upload ngl; glad I finally did though (:
The story of how Mario Wii ended 2d racism making that 2d games have the same Rights as the 3d ones
Hi Scott, thanks for giving me sufficient amounts of wholesome gaming content to watch while I get to an unhealthy level of fucked up in order to forget about the world around me 😀👍
AND ANOTHER
If large publishers keep using the correlation between MSRP and budget as an excuse to load up their games with predatory MTX and increase the sales price, then inversely the consumers are going to want to see the cost savings of lower budget 2D and indie games passed along to them.   If an 80 hour open world 3D story driven game with a huge budget costs $60/$70, then why does a 30 hour 2D casual game with only a tiny fraction of the budget also cost $60?
It's a good video, but I feel like Scott repeated himself way too much on this video. He made the statement that "2D games are seen as less than 3d, but they all have value" way too many times
Thirty days left until the release of Metroid Dread!
Scott is the best woz ever
Scott asks for games to be more expensive
44 on trending
If 3D Metroid game came out at the same time as a 2D Metroid games, it would drown the 2D game. Fans just buy what they can get -- at least that is the case for me. I played 'Ori' and 'Hollow Knight' for a couple of hours each and I don't understand the appeal.
i’ll always be a 1D guy. any more than a line is unnecessary
*JOIN THE OCCULT, DAD.*
Can someone tell me the game at 2:38? I played that so much as a kid and I have no idea what it is lol.
Can we please not complain that some games still launch at under 60$? I’m not sure my wallet can take it
He did it he said frogger 3d
Scott:  "What is this - moonshine or porn?"  XXX Jug:  "Yes."
Chibi-Robo wasn’t even mentioned. Only Zip-lash showed up for 5 seconds
13:22
scott really here complaining about the price being cheaper of games
What game is at 12:01?
So Scott what about the Kingdom Hearts series?!
Goemon Great Adventure is the best 2.5 game in n64
He just confirmed who he's talking too
Kinda sad that The Messenger didn't make an appearance in this episode. Such an amazing game that fits right into this discussion.
so you’re telling me when 3D games came out and relegated 2D ones to handhelds with lower budgets, that made people perceive them as less valuable?
What an absolute buffoon.  There's been nothing but a rise into the gaming in the indie scene. I got tired of 2d gaming awhile ago in fact because of how popular it is now.
0:05 When somebody tells me that Fire Emblem sucks
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🎈
can we just talk about how many times scott was held at gunpoint in this video?
I’ll take 2D all day, everyday. Besides 3D games make my fucking head hurt! I do however love Sonic Adventure on Dreamcast, as well as Halo on the original Xbox.
every game is 2D
I'll be happy to pay $60 for a new original 2D Metroid. It may be a sin among some gamers to say this, but I never liked Metroid Prime or the other 3D Metroids. In my eyes, the last true original Metroid was Fusion.
A lot of padding this one, yet doesn't even acknowledge the rising costs of developing games as a reason to promote 2d.  Only that 2d games are made to meet a demand for those specifically.
i prefer having all styles of games available on PC so i can have a laptop, steam deck or use cloud streaming to play all of those games, wherever i want, on any device i want.  No more need for phone, tablet, laptop, portable, console......just a phone and my sweet rig
Hey man what’s the game where you play as the man in fire that’s pissed
Great video Scoz the Wott!
I thought side scrollers had no y-axis. I always thought that z was height.
8:44 fellow bart main chad
Can somebody please tell me the name of the game at 04:19. I remember it so vividly but can’t remember the name.
5:01 AHA I FOUND A MISTAKE IN A SCOTT THE WOZ VIDEO  If you cant spot it ill tell you in the replies but it should be fairly obvious
8:16 ASYMMETRY! IT BURNS US!
You talking about the indi game boom reminds me of a problem I had back in the day (or at least what seemed like a problem). I remember for a time a indi platformer "had" to have at most a 16-bit art style, even if it wasn't sprites and were just "blocky models." I remember angrily ranting "if I wanted 8-bit I would play my NES, these are super powerful machines, make something that looks like it belongs in this century." Same thing for 7th gen games; the first generation with true HD graphics and all anyone is making is grungy war and zombie games with muted colors.
2d games are more fun imo 😂
Scott complaining about walking sections with diologe / story content ... Ugh. It's for you to take in the graphics and visuals, to absorbe the dialogue. But Scott just wants simple 8/16 bit platformers. Because anything more in depth is too much for him. The more I watch Scott the less I like the content. no offence if you like it. But it's just not for me.
So, bottom line, you want to be charge more for the games you like
Do one on discord!
I was here when the guy was trending
0:56 2D/3D/console...  Long ago the three gameplay styles lived in harmony Until the console limitations attacked
"high quality 2d games" shows mario maker 2 boss rush stage
Scott...don't feed the corporations. You should be saying "yay, Metroid Dread is $40! I'm so glad it isn't $70!"
Perfect video. Only flaw was you didn't talk about shovel knight
EVERYONE is about graphics when I'm sitting here playing Old School Runescape not caring at all about graphics
9:50 - 10:26 Scott solves racism at the family reunion
My favorite part of 2D gaming is beautiful hand drawn spritework. Sadly a lot of modern "2D" games are just using 3D graphics... kinda defeating the artistic point there.
I wish 3D platformers would make a comeback already, A Hat in Time was great.
-deadly- fun drinking game: everytime he mentions 2d games being put on handhelds, take a shot.
Sorry Scott, but I'd argue Quake is a much more influential 3D game than Mario 64 was.  It even came out first before Mario 64.
2:43 Tomba/Tombi music, hell yeah
1:39 Chrono Trigger's trees looked damn realistic for a Super Nintendo game.
love tou so much scott. fantastic epic video oimce again
2.5D was a term we were using in the graphic art field long before games with 2D gameplay and 3D models came about. It refers to using scale and overlapping to imply a 3rd dimension. When you slip behind the white blocks in Mario 3, that's 2.5D. The word was appropriated to include 3D-looking games with 2D gameplay, but that's really confused things ever since.
When is Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze getting it's own Video? I swear him mentioning the Game, by now is more of a Scott the Woz staple than Zip Lash taking a bath
There's a certain charm to 2D gaming that you just don't get in 3D.  Glad Scott's bringing more attention towards it.
God Scott you suck at Peggle
I had no idea there was a Galaga that released on PS360.
Kirby 64 is my favorite Kirby of all time, one of my favorite games of all time. But, Game Boy Advanced had two of the best Kirby games in the whole series which were some of the best games on the console. Like, what? Why isn't that talked about.
good luck with your family reunion, scott
In europe especially the UK 'shake it' meant jerking off
Yay more scott. Love ya you goofy bastard
The dilemma of portable vs console has me not want Sword and Shield for all that was done with the older generations of games feeling more feature complete. Graphics don't matter when missing Pokémon in said game. More in a $40 portable game than a $60 console game? It still sold 20 mil, so it must be a minority. Plus fans who haven't picked up a Pokémon game in years got attracted to graphics and got a Switch just to play it.
I fell asleep watching this and you ended up in my dream visiting me for the day😴
I'm a simple man, I see Legends of Dragoon, I like.
Yeah, sure, Nintendo, the maker of the Nintendo 64, which has like 5 2D games, while relegating 2D games for handheld, championed the fact that 3D and 2D games have the same worth... Suuure!  Listen, Scott, I know that you are completely obsessed by Nintendo, but come on, don't fabricate stuff please. Also, your titles are almost always about a general gaming subject, but they are 90% about Nintendo. For instance, the title of this video should have been "Nintendo : the Fall and Rise of 2D Gaming" or something like that. As a side note, you spend a LOT of time talking about New Super Mario Bros 2D, which is the most bland and vanilla game ever made, and never, once, talked about games like Cave Story, that ushered the era of indie games, that were the onces that actually pushed the popularity of 2D gaming more than anything else. Once it became popular, THEN Nintendo noticed and started to make similar game once again. Saying that Nintendo started the retro/2D gaming trend is completely false. They merely followed, like most, the trend once they were absolutely sure that it would be very profitable. Other than indie studios, MOST major developers started making 2D games way before Nintendo.  There is also a bit socioeconomic reason behind the retro/2d game revival. People in their 30s and early 40s grew up with those games, in the 8 and 16 bits era. They now have disposable income and want games like those of their childhood. We have nostalgia for those games, and nostalgia has been shown to be extremely powerful when it comes to spending money. An analogous phenomenon is one of the reason why a freaking myriad of super heroes movies were made in the past 10 years, for exemple.      You know, it's okay to be a fanboy, nothing wrong with that. But if your love for a company clouds your perception that much, and makes you shoehorn Nintendo where it absolutely does not belong, not only is it an issue in itself, but it also is frustrating to watch. It's more like being a fanatic than a fan... Yes, like you mention at every possible opportunity in most of your videos, SM 64 was a major milestone in gaming, and it well deserves its spot in the history of gaming. But New Super Mario Bros???? You really want ANYONE to believe that it had any importance whatsoever in anything? Are you serious?? A milestone for 2D gaming revival?? Lol, give me a break man, this is too much :P Tell that to Daisuke Amaya's face and see what he thinks of that. And if you don't know who that is, maybe do not make a video about the 2D gaming revival...  It's like when you talked about the 16 bit era for a big chunk of a video and never, not even once, mentioned Sega and the Genesis/MD lol. Ridiculous.
No D, that cracked me up xD
A 4D game would be us being able to see the length, width, volume, and space-time of an object. So, imagine a solid yet transparent object constantly in a rotation or existing in one point and then another at any given time. There is a 4D game being made but it is more of a toy box than a cutting edge experience.
Wow, I never considered 2d and 3D gaming like that, excellent video Scott!
pretty much herd "2d is conceded worse then 3d" about 60 times in different ways
Hollow Knight and Celeste, two 2D Indie games, are better than most AAA games I've played
Can someone please tel me what game that is at 8:27?? I know I’ve played it before but I can’t remember.
15:15 I didn't know Bob Wulff was Scott's aunt
Scott is a national treasure
It's worth mentioning that Dread is mostly facing the consequences of Nintendo overpricing re-releases for years. People are now more sensitive to the price of their games, and frankly, they kinda brought it upon themselves.
I love the Dread love, Scott!
Scooootttt!! Yes my day is saved. Litterly he's so cool.
seeing hollow knight in a scott the woz video makes me stupidly happy     also missed opportunity to mention FEZ, the 2d game with a 3d world with a 4d character
Definitely in the camp of overall enjoying 2D games when compared to 3D ones. Honestly I feel like 2D games allow for a lot more polish and consideration which I why I think 2D indie games like Shovel Knight, Cuphead, and Axiom Verge are considered fantastic entries in their genre. Still love me some A Hat in Time and BfBB Rehydrated but there's something about the 2D games that you can almost always be confident in.   Also side note: I kinda understand why companies relegated their "spin-off" games to handhelds. Assume the average consumer only has money or even interest for just one console - do you really think that they would favor spending another $100+ for a different system and the next game entry? Business-wise I don't see it as a fullproof plan when it will be safer to just develop the sequel on the same hardware. But let's not forget that Kingdom Hearts had its games on 5 different consoles and handhelds prior to the 1.5+2.5 and 2.8 collections and all of them were integral to the story. Why do I know this? Take a wild guess :`).
Remember when you can’t go back?

Good video but seems like an odd topic lol
“AND THEN I’D SAY WHAT A FAMILY REUNION WHERE DID EVERYBODY GO?!” 😂
Someone said Metroid Dread bad because $60. I expect this game to be at least 10 hours though
16:20 Scott you scared the hell out of my dog
9:06 what’s the game?
I can confirm that my grandma did indeed have a stroke playing Super Mario galaxy…  She got the sequel of that in 2… Yoshi included!
Cuphead wasn’t an XBOX ONE exclusive. It also came out on switch
20:32 ah, there it was. was waiting for when the reason for this video would show up which was pretty obviously because of the metroid dread aint worth 60 debate i've seen alot.
m e t r o i d  d r e a d  thooo
I contend that not every game on the PlayStation Store (or any platform) has the same worth, even if they are "are all games", and this isn't a problem. I love Scott The Woz and this video wasn't as well thought out as most of his content. Obviously, the number of dimensions in a game shouldn't dictate the price of the game, but the quality therein. But many of the points Scott makes in this video detract and distract from that basic truth in a way I found to be quite unfortunate. Better luck next time.
I still think there are franchises stuck in 2D that would benefit from a leap to 3D. Lots of people like to bash on DK64 and act like Donkey Kong just doesn't work in 3D because of that one game and claim that DK should just stay 2D, but if Mario and Zelda and Metroid can have 3D games coexisting alongside their 2D games, I genuinely don't see how we can't try Donkey Kong in 3D again.
Odin sphere and grimgrimoire on PS2 are purely 2D games from that era.
Commenting to appease the algorithm
And to this day we still don't have a 3D kirby or Yoshi game
id like to play more 2d games or hell more hand held games, but for some reason whenever i play a hand held i begin to fall asleep. Im not bored i like it just as much as consoles, but idk man it knocks me out and there's a lot i want to finish
Loe's fortune
5:35 how does Heroes lack intergrity
I was now years old when I heard about GTA advance
I don't know if it was just me but I definitely had to read that title twice
scott gets dimensia...
I too can only make it through family reunions by driving everyone away with game talk
And today we learned that Gunpowder is Scott's gin of choice
How do u put out so much good content
Surprising how he talked that much about 2D indie games, and never mentioned Undertale...
It's like the old saying goes: quality over quantity
2 much Too Dee
What is the Kirby game at 14:04? Anyone? Thanks
You did not just dissed Curse of Darkness, that's the only good Castlevania game, and it achieved that by not being a Castlevania game
I love that it seems Scotts friend was visiting, and he just wanted to use him the most he can
Games like Furi and Hollow Knight will always stay my favorite.
We went from "2d is all there is" to "everything must be 3d now" to "Ok maybe not EVERYTHING."
Forgot to mention how 2d flash games helped the resurgence
I'm surprised he didn't mention LittleBigPlanet at all...
I like 3D more
I love Scott's videos and scramble to watch whenever a new one comes out. They're always entertaining, and this one is too. But It's also clear that the writing is weaker on this video. He just repeats himself so much. How many times can you say, "2d games were considered inferior and relegated to hardware that couldn't do 3d graphics." Also, there are fewer gags in this video than usual.  Still good. Still entertaining. I just found this video beneath the very high bar Scott has set for himself. Hope he's doing well and doesn't feel like he's having to rush out projects to stay in the almighty algorithm's favor.
What game is at 12:14?
to be fair people are right to forget about phantom hourglass and spirit tracks. by far the worst zeldas
Now talk how 3D Platformers almost died thanks not only to the videogame industry trying to be more "adult", but also the comeback of 2D platformers, and how they came back, thanks to Crash, Spyro, Psychonauts, A Hat in Time, and even SpongeBob.
Even just seeing a game I love that I would never think Scott would play in the background of his videos makes me smile, for example castle crashers in the back for a few seconds made me strangely happy
HEY Scott this Wayneisboss is impersonating you.
Saturn's 2D chops were more due to cost-effectiveness than anything else and what came to PlayStation happened despite Sony's insistence on 3D games. Nintendo may have leashed its 2D installments to its portables post-2000, but it was the only major video game company which respected that design style without caveats. Also, it may not have celebrated the sales of individual portable games much, but it was always quick to let everyone know how well the portable systems themselves sold.
Hey Scott, the video output rate and quality recently has been really great, and I just wanted to show my appreciation for all the work you've been putting in this year. Thanks for the great content, as always!
Watching a dude saying he’s disappointed Sonic isn’t more expensive
Scott now needs to recite this next time he goes to a family reunion
14:23 thank you scott for blowing my eardrums out with that "BUT"
Whats the game at 9:56
That gun shot after the Super Mario 64 logo is unreasonably funny.  The jokes in this one are all on point!
10:13 the fact Scott has played castle Crashers makes me very happy
10:39 What is this game? It looks interesting!
9:33 Guys, is this the first time Scott has ever laughed in character?
Handheld consoles felt like knock-offs during the Gamecube era?   Hate to burst your bubble here, but they WERE knock-offs. The first legitimate handheld systems in my opinion were the DS and PSP and I will happily die on that hill.
This video makes me wish Wario Land Shake it would get ported to the Switch. The motion controls turned me off, but give the choice to turn those off and will defenitly try agian.
Growing up with Xbox 360 indie games was one of the best things I’ve ever experienced  (Castleminer and z, zombie hotel, solar 2, so many more)
TIL there was a gta gba game
Rayman provides an excellent example for your essay here. Rayman 2 was going to be a 2D game like the first but then development started over to create the 3D platformer Rayman 2. There were a bunch of 2D games on handhelds. Rayman 3 was another 3D platformer with more focus on combat which kind of reflects the move towards edgier and action-focused games at the time. Then Rabbids games were the way they are because minigames with motion controls were going to be a trend. And then Rayman Origins and Legends were created as 2D platformers but with much more speed and a game engine that would not have been possible decades ago.
God, I had forgotten about that Metroid Dread debate. The last 2D Switch game featuring Samus was... Super Smash Brothers. That was worth $60, but Dread isn't?
Can we please have videos of Scott playing Kirby's Return to Dream Land and Kirby Triple Deluxe and either explaining why he thinks they're more "generic" or realising that they are not generic
You can say the same thing with turn-based combat
I really miss the 2.5D platformers from PSX. You know, they weren't afraid to use  the third dimension: the controls were 2D, but the levels were curved, you could interact with the background elements, and sometimes even take some alternative paths. See Klonoa and Tomba series. And the modern "2.5D" games are just 2D, but with boring 2D models instead of sprites
I don't think you could really say that for Kirby when the main games were the handheld ones during the GBA era. The console game (Airride) was a spinoff, it wasn't a traditional Kirby game, so it's not like Kirby was ever limited, it was just always meant to be a 2-D game.
It's like what capcom did to Megaman.  Its like that one family member that wanted to make up for all the birthdays of yours they missed by drowning you with gifts... only ignore you for years until one day you recieve a nice little card with $30 in the mail...  ... meanwhile, another uncle goes off to make his own buisness, crowdfunds a big birthday event for you with thoundands of dollars backing it up, just to delay it over and over, until eventually you recieve a half eaten donut in the mail and a request to help fund his other family members birthday that he already had the funds for anyway.
Holy shit the exact scene unfolding at 13:50 happened to me so many times
i find it slightly cool for 2d games to be made 3d and vice versa
"There was a time where 2D Mario was basically extinct."  *Laughs in Metroid*
Omg, you're so on point with the bullshit of some 3d games...I know they're games from different eras but DK tropical freeze destroys DK 64 and is the perfect example. Just because a popular franchise is 3d now doesn't mean its a better game...many times the reality is that they are an empty garbage
Woah! Dimensions are my favorite too. Their great for grasping the concept that everything isn’t as binary as people try and make it out to be!
i loved those two zelda ds games, i'm glad somebody else realized how often they get overlooked.
shhhh scott we all love cheaper games
2D and 3D games imo are just different types of (sub)media within the umbrella medium of videogames
I think what makes 2D special is that it gives you closer to a dream-like or storybook experience where your imagination powers a lot of your experience. It makes the world “seem” so much larger than it would if you actually depicted it in a fully realized 3D environment. I know the saying “reality is often disappointing” sounds quite emo, but there is some truth to it in a non-nihilistic sense. Often, our expectations of things can be much grander than is possible in reality and good 2D games can really play off of that psychology.
Scott my dude I really do love you but you gotta work on that audio mixing. Your screams consistently scare the shit out of me.
4:10 "Whats half of z?" M
15:54 Deer Drive Legends.  I am intrigued by that name to say the least. Is it a hunting game? Is it a game about shepherding deer? Will I race against deers? Is it a game about racing as deer? Will we question the motivation of deer?  Googling the game will no doubt ruin this wonderous amazement.
Two of my top three dev companies do basically only 2D. Inti Creates and Arc System Works. The latter going to far out of their way to make even their 3D-based graphics more 2D-animation-like.  The missing link is From Software. Very 3D. Arguably more 3D than most AAA. Verticality often being a feature rather than a set-piece. Love it.
VR is usually talked about as 3D but can be divided into 3 degrees of freedom VR and 6 degrees of freedom VR. The difference being just tracking rotation (bad phone vr like google cardboard) vs tracking rotation an position (good pc, ps and stand-alone vr). 6dof VR is amazing!
I swear to god do not give nintendo mire excuses to overprice their games
Wow I’ve been playing peggle a lot recently because I was bored and it’s free on EA play and it’s actually kind of fun but I did not expect Scott to mention it.
That 'hey y'all' made me drip.
Scott "how many times I can say handheld games seem less important than console games" The Woz
Dropping the Tombi boss music. Legit.
I would love to see a Scott do a  video on Majoras Mask
please make a podcast where only you speak of random stuff for 5 hours straight
Does this video confirm who Scott's talking to, Dad?
14:48 stunning animation
I’m sick tired of just holding forward in triple A games just to hear the characters talking while taking a walk That trend absolutely needs to end I didn’t buy walking simulator
Shoutout Mario 64 FPS
I wonder how World of Warcraft would look like in 2D!
Good job on trending man
Moonshine or porn?? Absolutely destroyed me. I still regret not buying The Simpsons Arcade on my Xbox 360.
What is the game at 10:39?
I love it when my Scott the Woz has a bit that can be interpreted as a metaphorical argument against racism
Excellent topic. Always enjoy discussions on the importance of 2d
whats the game in 10:38
I dont think this was an accurate depiction of the popularity and importance of the 2D games on the GBA. Between the metroid series, POKEMON, castlevania, golden sun and a number of other series, I dont think it was scene as lesser at the time, especially as developers became better at making good looking titles.
oh no scott caught d'mentia again
Sad there was no screenshots of some of the ugliest 3d games from the early days of 3d, like Castlevania on the 64. Just terrible
awesome video Scott!
Every game ever is in 4D. The fourth dimension is time. If a game has any length, then it's 4D.
You guys remember the last TGA when Mr. Nintendo said indie game developers were like children that would one day grow up to be triple A game devs hahhahahahahahahhaha I’m still pissed Love the video btw and yes I call the Nintendo president Mr. Nintendo not my fault he has a stupid name
Dude I never thought Scott would come to putting something related to Batman Arkham Asylum. He needs to do a video on it, and similar stealth/combat hybrids
Shh...  that's why I prefer 2d games they're just as good as 3d ones but just cheaper
remember metal slug 3D? no? well that's because sony knew it wasn't gonna work but thye still didn't want to localize 2d games, it took them quite a few years to come to terms with the fact that 2D isn't a limitation, but a choice.
As a kid, it always bothered me that 2D was being phased out for butt-ugly polygons JUST as sprite-based games were getting advanced enough to have great animation. The indie boom is one of the single greatest things to ever happen to the industry in my opinion.
Mega Man 11 doesn’t get enough love.  I feel like it was exactly where Mega Man needed to go to modernize while staying true to his roots.
Scott just said Sonic Advance has more integrity than Heroes... lmao
🤍
Scott please don't let that Metroid Dread comment age poorly
can't wait for the next big tf2 update
Factorio and Terreria ... both are hugely successful 2D games
Great video but where’s terraria? They put SO MUCH in a 2D game
I still wish they port WarioLand shake it to switch
I have like a billion games and the most I've ever spend was like 30€ and most of the time it's under 10€. There are so many great Steam Keys and keys for other platforms that are dirt cheap and I think many games are overpriced, but not there.
Cut away gags are real good in this one
As someone who runs 2D-exclusive gaming websites, I've had this conversation a lot over the years, and you nailed it in this video.  2D gaming went from ubiquity to handhelds, to indie games, to its modern renaissance.  The 2D gaming resurgence over the past decade has been wonderful!
I just want a new 2d wario game .
Aren't those fancy gaming racing rigs 4D? I mean they can make your chair move, if you are willed to sell your liver and a kidney for one of those atleast...
I'm starting to devalue 3D games because they are often unfinished or full of bugs and glitches.
"What's half a Z?" A zzz.
Peggle was my first xbox game and first game in general i think 🥺
indie game  is such a positive label than it used to be. it makes you think: Fewer creators if not just one person, Passion project that wasn't released by a due date whether is done or not. Buying it goes to a more creative and gamer-centric part of the gaming industry. Indie used to mean probably a short game, maybe lacking in graphic quality restricted by the access of good design programs. Now everyone has access to the same game engines. Also gamers and critics have instant connectivity. if a game is good the reviews are out there and easy to access. We have a ton of trusted sources, not only a few sources owned by the companies themselves.
the fact anyone puts value on sports games baffles me, sports games are the least overall interesting games since its always the same crap as the last one.
Still not spending $60 on metroid dread lmao
Love your content but man those moments when you scream and blow out the speakers are so obnoxious.
I want to play the new Metro dread but I personally don't value it at £60..  But I would like to play it... but Nintendo never drop there prices...  I say this because the value I think it is doesn't matter, its what Nintendo tell me what they think its worth
What's the game shown at 0:47 ?
Does anyone know what game this is at 19:19?
15:16 Scottz Ties to the Mafia Confirmed??!!?? 0_0!
Scott you should really give the Oculus Quest 2 a chance and dive into a game of Population One or The Walking Dead, or Star Wars, or even play around on VRCHAT. It really is the future of gaming
16:20 Something tells me this is going to be the perfect meme template.
Great video Scott! I'm more of a 3D guy myself, but I enjoy plenty of 2D games as well. It's nice to see a great balance of the two.
Stop encouraging them to charge more for video games. They're expensive enough lol.
Prices should be arround the productioncost / customers x value needed + some extra for profit For a 2d game this will almost always be way less than $60.  20-40 is a good value for 2d games unles they are very very long and did cost a lot
I should know, I wasn’t there.  Said like a true fan. 😂👍
Can we talk about how Scott set up mouse trap for a 2 second gag
Wario THICC
Indie 2D games >>>>>>> Nintendo 2D games
rayman is underrated as all hell he gave us 2 of the best 2d platforms in the last decade yet scott or any one for that matter never mention it
For a good reason to separate handheld entries from console entries, please see the Kingdom Hearts series.
Closest thing I've ever seen Scott talk about inclusivity
2:42 HE SHOWED LEGEND OF DRAGOON! Now we can rest easy fellas, remake is finally coming
Holy fuck scott the woz
Only 2d And 3d battle going on is about Tiddies
This might be the first time I ever critique a Scott the Woz video; the first 7 minutes is basically entirely you repeating yourself :( still love ya
names every ea game asking why its 60 - meet ea, the biggest money grabbing game company of all time lol
Anybody else think of Caddicarus when he says 2.5D?
Who complains about a price being cheaper 😭😂
Great episode, Scott. This is one of the many reasons why I love your videos.
What about Megaman  legends! On Ps1!
10:22 YYYYYEEEEEAAAAAH CASTLE CRASHERS BAYBEEEEEEE  I LOVE THAT GAME, THEY SHOULD PUT CASTLE CRASHERS IN SMASH AS WELL  you should do a video on that game, only if you want to of course, I’m not gonna force you to do something you don’t wanna do but still
Meow
Can you please do a video on sunshine?
!AAWWWW?!  he showed My GAMES! Contra Hard Corps Shadow Complex Bionic Commando Thank You Kind SIR!!
here me out, video game racism
God this video sucked and i mean sucked, was like the least funny video scott has done in a while
I was exclusively a handheld gamer right up until the Switch came out, and it's always annoyed me that they haven't been treated as being just as important/valid/artistic as the console games.
Hey Scott, braulio09 here! Just wanted to say this may be my favourite of your "serious" videos.  You laid everything out clearly and gave convincing arguments and great examples. Keep up the fantastic work!
Scott is stuck in 0D.
Speaking of 3D and 2D games. On which side do you guys lean more on, when it come to rumored new Donkey Kong game? 2D or 3D? What would you prefer? I think 3D would be kinda cool again. I really liked 64.
The comedy is gold in this episode! Thanks for your hard work!
17:52 "a few people working on their own"...Cuphead? Really? It took them 5 years 🤷‍♂️ And like, 50 people worked on it (not the main team, the outsourced some work, but still. Musicians, designers, artists, support artists) I wouldn't say it's a "just 3 guys" project..not even close. You'd be thinking of Joe Danger, or games like that
what’s the game at 19:16 ? it looks super gud but I can’t find it haha
3DS had too much 2D, lol
Scott stop! They're gonna jack up the prices now!
This video was a bit repetitive IMHO.
Donkey Kong vs Mario wasn't a 2d platformer for the GBA?
I want Scott to make a video about 32 bit games
It is a crime that Carrion wasn't even in a clip on this video. Amazing 2D game that definitely deserves its place among these giants.
I really need Kirby air ride back right now. I played countless hours of that.
What's this got to do with the Wii U?
Big fan of the first-party Wii U library, but never even considered how many of those games were 2D. I think a 3D Super Smash Bros. sounds like a terrible idea, but maybe it would be more marketable.
Is it just me or is Scott repeating himself every minute or so in this video?
It should all be worth 30 or 20 tbh
Question: What was the  first propper 3d video game?
More like the rise and fall and comeback.
I think one of the main appeals for 2D games now is the challenge. While a lot of Nintendo's output on the wii and 3ds was fairly easy and simplistic, games like DK Country Returns really shows how brutally challenging 2D games can still be and now with games like Cuphead, Hollow Knight, all of Edmund McMillan's output the insanely challenging 2D games have carved their own niche in the industry similar to the souls games for the 3d market
I get what you mean value wise, but why complain that you can buy good games for cheaper?
I prefer 2D over 3D Pixel art first Cel shade second  Glossy 3D like the mario games third  I hate photo-realstic art style So mor 2D for me more indie please
outro music getting faster
the resident evil 2/3 remakes were a bad comparison for that purpose.  They are the antithesis of what you are trying to say, as the improved graphics made it more approachable and brought me to really enjoy them like I could never enjoy RE2 in it's original state.
2d is made of squares and 3d is made of boxes
8:28 , 8:37 I know...wrong video but still.....   It's tough being a Rayman fan...  (If u know u know)
Hell half the games i want for the Switch that are up coming are 2D, Gestalt, Bushiden,  Savior, The Vagrant, the list goes on!!! 👍🏿👍🏿
I'm not going to complain if some good 2D games cost less then 3D ones.
Scott there's maybe five or six games a generation that are worth $60 to me let's tell publishers to stop pricing their 2d titles affordably.
Reject modernity return to 1d
when you realize scott's #11 on trending
Well in a year all those EA and activision games will be like 5 or 10 dollars on ebay, but dread will remain 60 for possibly a third of a decade.
Nights or is it Knights was the first 3d game and was good
Gotta say the pricing point of 2d games probably comes from budget and time spent on it. Which is definitely less then what a big release takes. So I would definitely not pay more for an indie game than let's say ghost of tsushima. Other than that I agree with you.  And there was one second of legend of dragoon footage, so as per usual an instant like from me.
Mario 64, if you don't have nostalgia for it, is overrated. 3D World is the true GOAT. Don't @ me.
What you guys don't expect is for the family reunion to be an actual video with the rest of the Woz Universe cast. And for the "What a family reunion, where did everyone go?" line to be dropped at the wrong time.
What great perspective on such an interesting topic of which I haven't considered. Very epic
On the inverse side, all the shitty phone platformers saturated it.  This was before they realized all they had to do is make their sprites/3d characters anime girls and charge for everything.
Okay, but the links awakening remake shouldnt be priced at 60 dollars. Its a 1 to 1 remake of a gameboy game, one of the best gameboy games, but a gameboy gameboy gameboy game all the same. It shouldve been 50 dollars at launch, max.
Please do a video on Gran Turismo series next
So what your saying is 2d games are like the death and return of superman
2D games age much better than 3D games in my experiece, I will say that. But if I have to pick a new game to play today, it's most certainly going to be a 3D game. Not that there aren't any good 2D games, but like you said, the market is still very focused on 3D and that's where the money is going.
And this is why honestly I like handhelds more, I guess I can't get enough of 2d gaming on the go, the rise of 2d games on the switch is good for me but switch is still another handheld regardless
*Dreamcast:* So my robust catalogue of 2d and 3d games MEANS NOTHING TO YOU!?!?!
Warioland Shake is amazing and I would absolutely buy a rerelease on the Switch
You seriously having Super Mario Sunshine at the bottom of the graph.
Great video with an interesting topic
3D games tend to have more boring tedious gameplay than 2D games because the third dimension allows for that.
Scott's comedy is always great
Lost it when the chair was moving
I think a balance between 2D and 3D needs to be had in modern gaming. Terraria and minecraft show how much one change in dimension changes the overall gameplay of a concept. Mine craft pushes the sandbox while terraria pushes the action. Equally revolving around adventure and survival but through different game mechanics due to the strengths of what dimension they are in. Genres completely change their gameplay when you change their dimension.
I love this channel to the core
cRPG players at some point over last 20 years: "We  now have 3D models and you can zoom in..." DM: "STFU and roll for initiative"
15:15 Scott’s aunt is Bob Wulff confirmed
Scott mirrored my problem with the FF7 remake. Man I felt like there was more slow walking and talking than actually playing the game.
Pokémon should’ve stayed 2D…
oh yeah, you was just a glint in your dad's eye when Mario 64 came out...
Did that Chrono Trigger footage mean you've finally started playing it?
Guilty gear Strive might be the best looking 2D game now known to humanity  Second is Fire emblem Sacred stones
I really like your videos. They’re funny and i learn some things about games
This is why Golden Sun fans suffer.
"Twilight princes came out, and then Skyword sword"  This is funny, becouse a month ago I started to replay phantom hourglass and spirit traks, and push both to 100% completion
This video taught me that Metroid Dread is not worth 60$ 🙃
Me and the boys who spew up our entire guts at the sight of 3D and moving cameras
Meow
4:42 Putting the GCN on top of PS2. The shade 😂
Hey all,comrade BlueFox here,all I want to say the fact that this video is nice <3
tbh anyone that buys modern ball sport games, needs a reality check ngl
A friend of mine says they can't go back to 2D anymore and that it is too hard for them...like bro, you have an entire axis less to worry about
Hm
Also rise of smartphone games being simple and in 2d helped to recover 2d games in general.
This is probably the Scott video I agree with the least, especially some of the price points. The line “it’s up to the consumer to decide” especially annoyed me....it’s not, I can’t barter for Yoshi’s crafted world’s price and as for not buying the game, when companies see a game didn’t sell as well they never think “oh maybe we should have priced it lower” they think “well nobody likes Yoshi, let’s never make a yoshi game again. I do get the impression that Scott has quite a lot of cash to spend on his hobby, and in his videos has a bad habit of not thinking about people who don’t and can’t just ‘save up a bit more’. Plus consumers should ALWAYS be fighting for the lowest price possible, yet for some reason nowadays people get offended when you suggest something should be cheaper.
scogg
WTF IS A TOOTIE GAME!?
I still think Remakes or reimaginings Should be at least $10 or pounds cheaper Good video.🤔
This guy thinks nothing exists before a console does it.
I think the price points aren't really based on the dimension, just based on how they think it will sell (which unfortunately kind of ties it to the dimensions lol). 3D is more exciting like you said, and likely sells a lot more.
I didn’t know Scott’s aunt was Mike Ditka
2D games, a quick and satisfying snack, 3D a big meal, tasty but occasionally can give you the shits.
The fall of 2d is from that one time Scott dropped his glasses and had to use some random 3d glasses he had as a replacement for a few years until he could save up to buy new glasses
I'm gonna be so happy if Scott ever reviews super paper Mario.  Also isn't 4d time lmao
17:00 Yes they were business decisions. All video game studios are businesses and they're always going to try to get the highest return just like anyone else. Sure the people that develop the games are in it for the art, but the people making the decisions are in it for the money. They don't care what they have to tell you to produce as long as it generates profit from the company.
Metroid dread not being worth 60 bucks is not only because its 2D but mainly because the production values in the game seem super low when looking at the graphics for example. It just doesnt look like a full priced release AAA experience at all, it looks like a throwaway indie game
Why do you keep calling me dad?
I remember growing up with the gameboy advance and console and always thinking that the bigger box had the real deal, and anyhting like it was amazing. 2d was old and 3d was THE thing.   I remember trying 3d gba games and being kinda didsapointed.
I love scott but what is this video bro. It feels like he makes the same 3 points 5 times in a row? Usually it doesn't feel like that
It doesn't work like movies. A game that's cheaper to make _ought_ to cost less to buy, like any other product. (movies also work like this actually - check the budgets of movies that end up in discount bins first. And just how much do you think a DVD costs to make?)  But I'm also elated to see 2-D getting the respect it deserves; it was always elitist and snobbish to assume 3-D is somehow inherently better. Keep up the hilarious videos man!
"I want games to be more expensive" shut up. I still love you.
fuck you scott. haha just playing man great to see a new video
18:27 Switch: am I a joke to you? Ps4: hey, slow and steady wins the race
Even though today people accept 2D games as games, I'd argue that the majority of people see them as childish or bad games. I feel like that because of the pricing in indie games (the 2D ones) being way lower than a triple A game, of course, the production is cheaper but people tend to think that overpriced things = better quality
Hey, Scott. Make a vid about the Vita
So scott spend 20 minute talking to justified the metroid dread price, undestandable have a nice day
"Wario Land: Shake It" has FOUR different names depending on where you live (Wario Land: The Shake Dimension, Wario Land Shake and Wario Land Shaking being the other ones) and I think about that fact more than I should
Based on that quick joke, Scott likes gunwhale gin which means he actually has taste :,)
I need a new copy of nsmb ds
"-not like some kind of stageplay!" (Shows Super Mario Bros 3) Ha, I get it.

I still have to disagree that 2d games are worth as much as 3d games. They just cannot ever have as much as a 3d game has to offer.  Of course that is not to say all games are made equal. Many 3d games are bad and are not worth as much as other 3d games are. But that does not mean that 2d games should rise in price. It means that cash grab 3d games should be lower in price.  The best 2d games will just never be as good as the best 3d games. And that's fine.
I'll have you know, it only took me twenty minutes to realize what he was really talking about.
This is interesting and something I've noticed that carries on today. Something I've noticed is the social aspect updates have had on gamers.  Now if your game can be updated, people expect more content out of games. Which indirectly makes developers hold content from release to fluff out the life span of the game. Shooters probably have this the worst
NHL 21: $60, Triple A 3D game, just another NHL game Undertale: $10, Indie 2D game, became my favourite video game of all time!
I hate the fact that this is the case. It's frustrating that 2D was sidelined. Even still people see it as inferior. Metroid Dread comes out soon. Alot of people said Nintendo was overcharging for a 2D game. (Bare in mind I've pre-ordered) But how can people judge value on this medium?  The introduction of 3D should have been like Rock and Roll or Hip Hop. It's a new format, but it's still music.
Virgin Sonic Fans: "No SoNiC DiDn'T HaVe A RoUgH TrAnSiTioN iNtO 3d" Chad Scott: "Sonic 3D Blast."
Even though it can be overused to just press forward and watch a cutscene.  i think it can also be used as an artistic choice like feeling the enviromnent. In your statement to it you let it seem like its always bad and rather prefer to Play without it, when i feel like alot of immersion would get lost to it. But i get it as i said it can be done wrong and also be really annoying but when its done correctly it feels really good.
Ah yes. Verified profiles with generic comments up on a pedestal at the top  Totally worth reading and greatly contributes to the topic
Music from Tomba boss fights? Sounds super familiar
Interesting that you didn't mention Super Smash Bros. which was a Nintendo made 2D on the N64, a rarity.  Or Mortal Kombat which really embraced 3D in the PS2 era (and even before that with MK4) with the trilogy starting with Deadly Alliance. Even had a 3D spinoff with Shaolin Monks.  But then once the PS3 era hits, MK went back to 2D where it thankfully remains... and it's selling and scoring better than ever. MK9 and XL remain my favorite MK games to date.
man after seeing Hard Corps Uprising, im mad thats still not on steam :/
You kinda remind me of a young Matthew Modine from Full Metal Jacket, but I’m trippin balls off shrooms and weed brownies so maybe my perspective is fucked.
I'm still not paying $60 for dread (or any game). I'll rather wait for it to be $20 or for the switch to end production so I can morally pirate it.
Hmmm about the fluff and cutscenes… am I the only one who actually enjoys that? I kind of enjoy games as a cinematic experience IM A PART of, that’s why I love playing games like Pokémon, Genshin, Persona 4/5, kingdom hearts etc  and 2D games can also do these cool cutscenes, examples are Pokémon black and white and their sequels
The fact that Scott put together an entire game of mousetrap just for 2 seconds of content is absolutely hilarious to me
Looks like Scott has Dimentia again.
No Hades gameplay, i am unimpressed
I think that in every aspect other than marketing Dread cost more to make than Pokemon Sword and Shield. Granted almost every other game on switch probably even calculator cost more to make from the looks of it.
8:04 Who’s that girl?
14:50  Scott: "And great animation-"  *Shows Wario's shaking butt*  I suppose Scott has his priorities right
Hey scott can you make a video about limited run games?
I can always tell what coast someone’s from on how they pronounce the word Mario
Gaming has trends, hopefully it levels out to a semblance of balance.
Scott Scott Scott you gotta quiet down about the whole price thing you don’t want them finding out the worth of the 2nd dimension ok
Excluding FPS games. Basically everything else I play is 2D. Metroidvanias's, Fighting Games, Blaster Master, Katana Zero, Mario Maker. I actually have a hard time thinking of 3D games I've played off the top of my head.
Showing Wario shaking it at the word "animation" was definitely a decision that was made.
Why did Scott the woz compare Indie games to avengers and shovel ware to Poltergeist!
Glad most 2D games are priced lower. No game is worth £60/70, but I'll gladly pay no argument, half that on day 1.
As I get older I find that 2D style games are much easier to get into and play to completion because of less fluff. For example DQXI in 3D compared to 2D whilst looking better has so much time spent just walking and doing "Whatever" compared to the streamlined 2D version where you can breeze through the games plot points whilst retaining the core gameplay.
11:47 just no. Such a weird argument... you come to the right conclusion (masking loading screens) and then feel the need to add something fabricated just because the point wasn't negative enough? On top of that there are tons of time wasters to call out (level gating, crafting, ressource management). Why would you weaken your point in such a stupid way here?
I remember getting laughed at for buying Earthworm Jim 2 on PS1 because it isn't 3D, like I was wasting my money on dated junk. The idea of playing 2D games when everything could be 3D seemed silly to most people. I enjoyed the PS1 era while also buying SNES games for pennies.
and another one and another one and another one and another one and another one and another one and another one and another one and another one
Certified Greg moment.
there must be something wrong with me because I fuckin love sonic 3d blast
Made me weirdly happy to see Hollow Knight gameplay on this channel
Megaman X8 and megaman network transmission are both console games in 2d from the gamecube/ps2 era
Lots of redundancy in the script of this episode
...And Rise Again
Please don't advocate for games to be more expensive.
This generation, Nintendo's been pretty lazy with their development of games. They're releases have just been terrible.  Skyward Sword HD is a good example of that. It's not graphically appealing enough to call it HD and the only change gameplay-wise was the ability to use a regular controller. It wasn't worth $60, especially when the original was priced at $40.  They've also been heavily making content for "A limited time." Hoping people would snatch it up asap. I think gamers have started to catch on ever since Nintendo stopped selling All-Stars 3D.  And speaking of All-Stars 3D, for half of it's life you couldn't even use an NGC controller to play Sunshine, the game that originated on the NGC.
Comment for the content you make* please keep up your great work.
Ok.
Wolfenfart 3D
1:19 : shows ori in the back me : :)
Lmao, Scott, we are all poor, stop complaining that well made 2d games aren't priced as high as shitty 3d games, in the end the consumer wins.
Fiancé just kicked me out and this is just what I needed, thanks Scott!
Is't always great to see how a franchise well work in 2d or 3d
Love when Scott throws volume balance out the window.
I hate how Mega Man 9 and 10 were just imitations of the NES games. It almost feels like Capcom was basically saying that 2D was dead and the only way to do a modern 2D game was to heavily bank on nostalgia.
I like both 2D and 3D games but I tend to lean towards 2D because they're more straightforward and because, the majority of the time I get lost playing 3D games
Some genres just work way better with 2D gameplay, most fighting popular fighting games are all 2D, Smash, Fighterz etc. Then there's bangers like Celeste and Hollow Night. 2D games just as great
11:10 the reason why 2D Zelda games are way better than the 3D ones.
Could someone please tell me the name of the game at 18:12?
0:10 16:21
when are we getting 1D games
Does anybody know what game Scott was showing around the 8:57 mark?
Week 5 of calling out Scott the Woz for saying no one will make PS1 nostalgia games
Warioland-Shake It is hands down my favorite Wii game. Period. Also, absolutely banger soundtrack.
Metroid was a weird exception though where Fusion is the 4th entry in the main series while Prime is the spinoff series.
ah hell the IRS finally got Scott
Spam 0 on ur keyboard
I actually think 2D/3D games can be compared to black & white/colour TV because black and white does require a different way of story telling. Some b&w movies or series are still made
Scott I love u but whats the deal with the audio :( I either cant hear you or my ears are exploding on the same volume setting.
Honestly with Mario I'm hoping they focus more on 3D, unless they can legitimately revolutionize the 2D formula. Each 3D Mario is an incredible, unique experience (ik there's 2 Galaxy games but still), whereas honestly I've seen more than enough from SMB, SMW, Yoshi games, and NSMB. They don';t seem like they can iterate on those series in a new, creative way, whereas again they never fail to do something brilliant and incredibly fun and immersive with every 3D release, so I'm happy they've been focused on those and hope they continue to
The joke at the end killed me
Scott you realize most of the stuff in this video is not in 2d, right? 16:20 "And another 2d game" Scott, it literally says 3D Not every side scroller is a 2D game!
Thanks, Scatt. It’s my birthday today and my party wasnt great. Your videos do real good! I know I can depend on you talking about things that only you think are important to help me feel better. Maybe get rid of that border though.
Fun fact : The Game Boy Advance is WAY more capable to run complex 3D games than expected. Trust me, i'm a fan of GBA 3D games 😊
Lol
Yeah this is the reason I have no interest in the most recent Metroid games; with their newest 2.5 perspective and overall switch to 3D models from the beautiful sprite works of past games such as Fusion or Zero Mission its all just so bland and uninteresting.
Could you cover The Rise And Fall And Rise Of Mega Man Games?
Once again a Banger vid❤
9:52 Scott The Woz accidentally ends racism whilst talking about the XBox Arcade
I would on usually agree with Scott, but my god I wish there were labels in the switch eShop. There is so much garbage in there. It’s like looking on the AppStore for games.
Its harder to stretch a 2D game’s content for the $60 price unless you make it a metroidvania or have high replay ability. Even with all that Hades is only $30
Scott came very close to saying he doesn't like having stories in games.
0:44 amazing.
Skate 3 is one of my favourite games because it suffers from none of those problems that 3d games have nowadays
Mcu sucks
Looks like the dimentia is kicking in again
Ok
See here is the deal with New Super Mario Bros for me, while in the DS is really neat what they did i did kinda wanted something similar like they did for Wario Shake it! having a 2D mario with THAT kind of 2D animations and cutscenes.  Not saying that what we got for Wii with NSMB was bad far from it, but damn im still pissed that they didnt saw Wario Shake it! and said "yes more of that please"
Lol I agree with that 2D games should be priced the same as 3D games but at the same time im not complaining that im spending less money
:0
Fogger 3D, a product of our time, pushing the extent of hubris for man
Can anyone tell me the game at 19:20? I've been trying to find it for a while now.
Can we get a count on how many times Scott said “console” in this episode?
In all fairness sane people don't even think sports games are worth full price. You can get last year's game with the same players for 10 bucks, and the year before for 2.
1D gaming Is the best.
🤣🤣👏👏awesome video as always Scott!!👍🔥🔥😌
The adventures of kincaid and tailbound: let us introduce ourselves
What game is this? 9:50
As a guy who prefers 2d. 3d platforming feels more difficult and often times more clunky as camera perspectives don't always feel like helping you.
not first
Hey Scott, you should talk about hollow knight
This video makes me realize Nintendo is basically "Oh, you're thirsty? Here's a firehose!"
Scott when Flingsmash becomes 3d:  Hey all debt here.
rehab jokes hits hard when in alcohol addiction
Fun fact: scott said "for a while there" 3 times in this video
I just woken up from dreaming about Scott… aw man
I tend to enjoy 3d games like satisfactory or shooters, they tend to take advantage of the format and arn't just walk and talk simulators
Metroid 2 sold more than Super Metroid? Well colour me impressed.
Ohh shit. Scott finally got the lcd screen for his PS One. Nice!
*Peppa Pig enters the chat*
Is this the guy that owns sonic jam? I love this guy!
I think most of us will agree that Sonic Mania is a great game.  I've seen people say that if a game like Mania had come out on the Saturn back in the day that it would have been amazing and helped sell a few more Saturn consoles, but I disagree with that.  If Mania had come out in 1996 for Sega Saturn most people would have laughed at it and compared it to something like Crash Bandicoot on the PS1.  They would have said Sega was stuck in the past releasing a 2D Sonic game when 3D was now king.  There were actually some pretty good 2D games for both the PS1 and Saturn but odds are you've never played them or even heard of them.  Why?  Because back then even if your 2D game was the most amazing 2D game ever made with fantastic gameplay it would be ignored.  Most people would look at it like "psssh, 2D is old news man.  The new hot stuff are these blurry low res polygons!"
I could have sworn you talked about this before
Great video new sub lmao
Smash Bros?
These episodes are your bread and butter and the absolute reason why I watch your channel. Thank you.
I have tried but I simply do not get immersed in 2d games, not even Zelda. Fine on mobile for a few minutes, but hardly ever on console... I'm sorry 🥺
Goemon's Great Adventure is another fantastic primarily 2D N64 game. In fact, I think it showed the strength of 2D being an overall better experience than its 3D predecessor Mystical Ninja Starring Goemon on the same system.
2D games are easier and quicker to make, and have less development time and money would be my guess
That analogy isn't going to work if Metroid dread turns out to be bad
Great video man. Always glad to see this type of content and style. Keep it up
Always love to watch a Scott the Woz before going to sleep
Nintendo: Hmm today we will make another New Super Mario Bros Me: God damn it Nintendo! Make something actually new! Also me: I can’t wait to get it!
Same.
15:56 HOLY SHIT WHAT GAME IS THIS I HAD IT ON MY WII AND HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS CALLED FOR LITERAL YEARS
This whole video was a Metroid Dread push. I like it.
i wonder how long that mouse trap cut took to set up for 2 seconds.
Scott the Woz
10:24 man just solved racsim
Hey, if the 2d game can rise again, so can the single-player only game!
Another banger from my guy Scott. Keep it up homie
How are you so awesome?
My favourite game of all time is a 2D, downloadable only indie game, of course they're not worth less.
This guy has the best takes on the gaming industry 👏
Is it just me or does Scott repeat himself alot in this video
While I have no problem paying $60 for a new 2D metroid game (Super Metroid is my all time favorite) stuff like remakes and ports (DKC Tropical Freeze and Skyward Sword) at full price is tough to swallow
the answer to the age old issue of "what are we gonna do with the up and down buttons"
Is it bad that this is the first time I heard of warioworld?
Only Scott can complain about not spending more on games
I played plenty 2D games growing up because that was all that was available, and I absolutely see the transition from 2D to 3D as the same as the transition from black and white to color tv, I have absolutely no interest in going back to the stone ages. idc what the game is. absolutely not interested.
Scott just made a whole 20+ minute video just to complain about the dunces who say Metroid Dread isn't worth $60, and I freaking love it.
It was a great analysis video, but Metroid dread will be out at a 60$ price because all Nintendo games are expensive af even after half a decade
scott thought of this video while sitting in a chair thinking of why they made the decision to turn chibi-robo to 2D
@6:35 What Kirby game is that?? I remember it as a kid and want to play it again
Love your videos Scott 😍😍😍
Honestly… Metroid dread is worth $60. It looks incredibly. And honestly it’s 2.5d 😂. SO IT MUST BE WORTH $45??!?!? Pffft nah. Either don’t buy it or just buy the special edition 😂😂😂
11:00 Was that mouse trap? Board James + Scott the Woz collab coming soon?!?!
It warms my heart when anyone remembers Mischief Makers
Just when you think there literally cannot be any other topic for him to cover, Scott “The MF” Woz comes out swinging with yet another niche clusterfuck of a video…  10/10 king, keep ‘em coming
Saying integrity while sonic footage was playing gave me whiplash
It is rather mindblowing to know that Super Paper Mario was, technically, the first 2d Mario platformer for a console since Super Mario World.
Damn Scott you’re funny AF!!  I love your one liners!!
Thank you for uploading this on my birthday Scott.
Ooof that jab at resident evil 3 remake 😭 it’s true though
Is this the most guns ever in a Scott video? 17:15 Wow Scott, Nintendo? Making bad decisions for their customers? Unheard of!
You know Scott, youve made a great point about the 3d era of games just being the one filling our game with graphics and cinematic crap that is worthless and time consuming, many teams like valve make ways around that like areas to explore during exposition but i really wish that more companies focus on developing the story through actions as opposed to watching a bunch of videos. scott what you're doing here is important future game developers and current are watching this video, and they will see.
What'is that shooter at 10:38?
Please dont talk about 3d sonic please dont talk about 3d sonic please don't talk about 3d sonic
Sssh don't tell em to charge more for games
I like dogs
Man, games are expensive more than enough, don't give them an idea. And if you're sayin' that 2D "is much more easier to make than 3D" (the point I'm heavily disagree with), why should they cost more? Do you pay the same price for attending Bolshoi theatre and local karaoke?
SM64 was when life was good
loved the vid as always scott the woz Rhyaape nyaagers
9:34 that’s a scary laugh
This guy really said that "all games are equal"
Scott based
All jokes aside I wouldn't have bought sonic mania for the price of Botw or Mario oddessy.
Lincoln's dead?!  Someone had better tell all the Confederate sympathizers that keep telling me that they were attending his party, quickly!
How did I know Kirby was gonna get mentioned when 2D?    Oh, yeah, lmao
Another fantastic episode as always scott
Game at 2:36?
I remembered the time when many saw 2d graphic as a bad thing, IGN for example.
have you ever heard of this small franchise called pokemon ?
This was an amazing episode 🙌
3:44 Lol Scott mislabeled WCW/NWO Revenge
I wanted to sleep. Nevermind
14:50 wario T H I C C
wait a minute I thought I paid $60 for Metroid Dread
Scott mentioning Wario Land Shake It and Megaman X8? Two of the best underrated games, what a dream.
I did not know that  a Wario Land game was on Wii, that looks absolutely beautiful
As a Hockey fan, I can certainly say NHL 22 is worth about $10-20. This is why I never buy sports games at launch no matter how much I love them, they’ll always get cheaper.
I'm a fair bit older than you (38), and you perfectly articulated why I still mostly prefer 2D games (in addition to the nostalgia).  Simple, fun gameplay without the fluff.  I'm already preoccupied with my job, family obligations, investments, other hobbies, efforts to keep in shape, and so on.  When I play a  game, I generally want instant fun, not walking around just to get from Point A to Point B.  That and even great 3D games like Dark Souls tend to have issues with precision and camera angles that 2D games usually don't have.
Hey what’s wrong Donkey Kong King of Swing????
a 20 minute scott video this the kinda shit i live for
Your Nintendo bias really shows lol. PC gaming has been covered in various 2D games with thousands of indie titles with the first of almost every genre of 3D and its innovations. And many of the former arent just for money reasons - games like Rimworld just as an example specifcally use 2D for reasons laid out in the devs GDC keynote.   As far as firsts and pioneering 3D, games like Might and Magic, Ultima Underworld, other 2D first person games before brought ideas even before 3D accelerators. Many games back then did amazing things with little notice because of how much harder it was to break out and become a success. Nintendo was an iterative company even back at its best in the 90s. Always has been. It gets by on refinement and now also on its characters and die hard, nothing exists but Nintendo-esque fans and their influence. Im biased myself, but I felt the need to point this out since I know you have little experience with PC gaming.
What a clever idea to have a video on… I never realized how 2d just… disappeared in arguably the biggest part of my life as a gamer
Wario Shake it land was a huge game from my childhood, and im glad to see it get recognized finally
i disagree
I mostly play 2D games ... but that's partly because I play most on my handheld systems.
Technically time is the fourth dimension so any game that is 3D and has a time management system could be considered a 4th dimension game.
What’s the dinosaur game at 19:18?
the joke at the end has killed me. Scott, you are a murderer. Thank you!
GTA 1-2 were in 2d from to down perspective and they were both on playstation 1 and GTA 2 was on PS1 and Dreamcast
The jokes were primo here. Awesome video.
Who knew the Z-Axis gave so much room for filler?
It’s weird how he criticizes 3D games for having repeated sections with little reason, yet he mention how 2D games were put on handhelds basically just due to limitations, like, 7 times in 20 minutes.
What the fuck, Lincoln's dead?!
it is so weird when someone says bionic commando and there's no sound effect after it
No Scott it was the bit wars lol
It's good to see you again, Scott. I thought for sure Ride To Hell finished you off. Thank heavens I was wrong.
Lmao you know what they say...
scott should do a no man's sky video next
Man i really needed a scott upload today 😂 just didnt know it untill i saw this thank you
︻╦╤─
Just in time for Metroid Dread's imminent release
Nah, if a game cost less to make, I want to see it reflected in the price tag. Paying 60 dollars for every game adds up. I would be far more likely to buy your game if you priced it at 30 bucks
Otherwise great episode as always. To me keeping illustrations vs. 3D models for games like Disagea (until 6 came out),  those that use Live 2D for expressions, eye blinding in visual novels especially, or other games doing 2D-3D design is surprising and good pixel art is always great to look at. Do prefer 3D (the games with depth and expanded on 2D or did enough of their own thing not 'look at the beautiful world and bad 360/PS3 walking, fillet content in open worlds' give me a playground not a painting to walk in, everyday tasks in a video game. Sure not everything needs to be power fulilment experiences like driving a fast car, being a superhero or even an animal with interesting abilities don't have to be a human or because normies can't push past the more creative side of gaming just basic real world logic in games or games more insulting to kids then good everyone games but there is a reason we prefer it or good gameplay ideas) just like using an analogue stick over a D-Pad it's cool to see what can be done. Also never understood handhelds being lesser. Especially as phones drive technology just like PCs do but I know yes they are more years of tech behind consoles and PC but to me making something portable would require more effort due to the battery and what tech can work without a TV.  I think that N64 had many 2D collectibles or trees and other elements in the world. which honestly shows the limits than PlayStation or Saturn with no or fewer 2D collectibles or trees in the world even if Saturn was a 2D first with 3D elements in mind console. Mario 64 is a Nintendo fan's first 3D game on a 32/64bit console and would ignore Pilot Wings and that's all they accept of did it first because they didn't play the other consoles, sure SNES and other examples of games but if the fifth gen then sure to cut off that era rand will always say it did it first because ignorance. Sure it maybe did the mission based design in a platformer, first don't know about that but still the popular game people think of just like the Odyssey is the first console, Fairchild first cartridge and 2600 the noteable console but improved platformers, eh depends if you hate mission design or count other forms of design in platformers. Sure limitations made them have to go this way but other games had multiple rooms or levels with tasks even if basic ones who cares. Mario 64 honestly sucks. To me I don't care other 3D games came before and did a better job.
05:12 **BREATH**
I love 2d, but I hope they hang around the 5-40 dollar range
I just realized that copy of New Super Mario Wii isn’t using the red Wii game case...true to form I guess
The Fall and Rise of 2D Gaming. Or affectionally know as "This 2D Shall Pass"
Hey alllllllll
The audio balancing on this episode is a little all over the place, very good episode still BUT god damn my ears.
He made me remember Ballz 3D! What kinda person throws ballz in your face like that?!
Oh my god that guy with sonic jam is  trending!!
What is the game at 18:13?
Can anyone tell me what the game is at 6:00, I want to play it  Using the rest of this comment as a list: Bionic Commando
"What is this, moonshine or porn" hilarious
Scott ..... WELL DONE
I love how one of Scott’s points in this video is that he WANTS to be charged more for 2D games
"The Graphics look too old! I want NEW NEW NEW!"   God I hate people like that. People held that opinion that 2d sprites shouldn't exist back then, and still today. WHY? Why do people hate sprites so much?
Still waiting for another 3D Donkey Kong game.
2:50 thank you for giving the 7 active klonoa fans a moment of bliss.
You state that Nintendo "devalued" 2D games. But at 17:31 you admit that you agree with that.
It took less than 10 seconds for this video to be funny.
I basically didn't care about gaming until 3D and Mario 64/Pilot Wings 64. I think the exploring of a 3D world is what hooked me. I've been chasing that high ever since. VR with the Index is the closest I've come.
Damn that person with the gun really likes Scott.
GTA was 2D? How?
what game is that in 10:40  and 10:43?
Why do you want your games to be more expensive?
Scott getting stubble after playing Ride To Hell
What game is that @ 12:16
There's a certain charm to 2D gaming that you just don't get in 3D.  Glad Scott's bringing more attention towards it.
How this man wraps up the joke in the end of every video is insane
3:04 "But have you noticed?"     *HAVE YOU NOTICED?*
0:45 this part killed me..
mr wozniak i love you but please stop multiplying your video length by repeating every point like 3 or 4 times
2:25 omg I never seen footage of that game, and that damn level obviously in well over a decade Ugh. I just got nearly knocked out with nostalgia! Very bittersweet to see. I'm 24, psONE came out my birth year, or 95 I can't exactly remember but my brother was older so we got one, our first console and we played for hours. Such an amazing start to a lifelong hobby I hold dear to my heart because of memories like that 💖💪gAmEr
How did you not once mention Stardew Valley - Forrr shammeee
The knights of ne would be terrified if this ever got out to them 14:42
I think Scott made this video just to call out the people saying Metroid Dreads bad just because it doesn’t have a Z Axis
Always a great day when Scott uploads
1:10 Just thinks of the rabbits, Scott
Steam and garage sale are the only place now you can get a decent game for 5$ or less
good ending question; Where DID everyone go?
.
Why is he playing with his ballz
And then Scott was never invited to another family reunion ever again...
Is it just me or is your audio always horribly unbalanced?
As a megaman fan, was megaman x7 so bad that scott use it as a example?? Wow im honored
“It’s almost like handheld games were treated as spinoffs, like as if they weren’t as important as the home console releases.”   Laughs in New Super Mario Bros.*
The mystery man holding a gun to Scott's head has appeared so many times now I'm starting to think Scott has actually been taken hostage and this is a cry for help
"2d games like this were finally making a comeback on consoles" *shows sonic 4*
The problem with making the 2d games for the sake of cost effectiviness, is that they are uninspired and it doesn't matter what you make, 2D or 3D game or a movie or a book, if it's uninspired, it shows in the finished product, the audience really feels it. But even a bad movie that knows it's bad can be entertaining and even if it's not super polished the audience can feel if the cast were having fun with it. I think with all the New Super Mario Bros games basically all felt the same, there was no passion, no inspiration.  Sonic Mania was inspired and the people making it loved making it and it shows and feels in the finished product.
is that why they call it the "Z" button on the n64?
Scott at the end decided that we need to spend MORE money on games...he's working for the companies!
I actually enjoy Sonic 3D Blast.
Finally, 2D gaming is back, loved, and embraced by the players! Happy times indeed!
You could say that Pokemon was the opposite the main series on handhelds and sidegames one the consoles
Stop complaining about 2D games costing less they're gonna increase the price
Nah bro you know nba 2k is fire
this is the only man I could think of to talk about video game racism
Picking up the game or Super Mario maker
Why is scott obsessed with guns
Harmony.
What hat is in the background?
I'm happy with 2D games not being 60 because I'm spending less money:)
Glad ppl are finally getting sick of indie titles. What used to be a a nice break from the AAA titles for experimentation has become a mess of 99 generic or crap titles for every 1 good indie title.
Scott on a Tuesday?  I’m surprised… but I’m also delighted…
dawg the first 10 seconds has my dying already. my stomach fucking hurts
13:30 69
Scott Single handedly is going to make the prices of 2d games 60 bucks now.... I LIKED NOT HAVING TO PAY FULL PRICE FOR FULL GAMES COME ON!
I think the best part about this video, is that Scott gave more attention to the EA NHL series then EA themselves have given that franchise is the last 8 years
How is Cuphead an Xbox exclusive?
I wish Scott played Pokémon games. He’d have so much to say about them wrt this topic
2:42 The Legend of Dragoon!
I love this channel, but Scott really needs to dust off his consoles before he films them
I just love this guy
do wish there was a little more talk about fighting games since a majority of them besides like tekken and virtua fighter are 2d and they still have a huge impact on gaming as a whole
Me to myself: this is going to be a good one
Love side scrollers.   Tmnt. 2021
As someone who played a lot of grand theft auto advance… just don’t
2 genres that will always reign supreme with 2d games is platformers and fighting games, yes they use 3d models but its still a 2d format
Kirby Epic Yarn was my first game ever beat and replayed and DK Country Returns was first game I bought with my own money
Have yyou tried bloody zombie on psvr.. oh the potential.
wario land: shake it was my favorite game on the wii, it makes me really happy to see it get more positive attention :)
Scott never misses. Laugh out loud at every one of this mans videos. Comedic genius.
Scott you truly are talented. Your vids are always fun and entertaining.  That being said I love RE3 REmake.
4d is when you can smell the game
someone plz help. whats the game at 8:26
Was Lincoln a call back to calling 2-D a theatrical play earlier?
Whats the game shown at 19:17 and 18:12 ?
I could buy Sonic Forces for 40 bucks..... or i could buy Sonic Mania for 20 and use the rest to buy a drink or something
What's the platformer at 8:57?
I wonder if Scott will do a video on Metroid next, with Dread coming out soon...
Tornado man theme tornado man theme👁👁👁
do cars games usually look really good cause they dont have to animate as much?
If time is a dimension, then all 2D games are really 3D and all 3D games are really 4D. However, we know the NES could never handle 3D games. This proves time is not a dimension.
Can you plase review my wedding tape
How is there a 1.8k xomments in like 21secs
The Mega Man 9 music started playing and tears started. I'll never forget the day that trailer dropped.
This is definitely going in the videogame essay video hall of fame.
The only game I really play is Tetris... Is that 3D?
omg I noticed a jet force gemini cartridge in there. I would love an episode on that game. Have very fun vague memories of playing it as child
This is another amazing aspect of the Wii: an incredible balance between 2D & 3D gaming. The NES & SNES were all about 2D, and the N64 & GC were all about 3D, but the Wii managed to do both. The controller itself could transform from horizontal play to 360 play by simply plugging in the nunchuck. Comparatively, the Wii U got a little too 2D trigger happy, and many 3DS games were simply ports of Wii games. With the Wii we got a rise of original, AAA 2D titles that coincided with fellow AAA 3D titles. Especially a game like Sonic Colors played like a hybrid of both dimensions flawlessly. Super Paper Mario took this to another level. Fortunately, the Switch has a similarly good balance.
Loved to see Zelda: Minish Cap make a small appearance! I impulsively bought a copy along with a second hand DS Lite a few days ago and man, what an underrated gem.
Me and my dad used to play nsmbwii and dkc returned it was great
I always thought that 3D games should have started during the PS2 era. PS1 & N64 have awesome 3D games but we can all admit, they don’t look great (in their own way they look cool though). Compare them to 2D games on those consoles, they look amazing.
Scott check out Misc. a tiny tale for nintendo switch it’s takes direct inspiration from chibi robo
What game is that at 2:39? I've been trying to find a game I had for my old PS1 where you play like a cop or fbi agent and it looks like the game. I'm hoping of I hear the title it'll help jog my memory. I think the end of the first mission includes a shootout in a Chinese restaurant too but I can't be sure.
Is it just me or does Scott allways look high
End the dimmentionism
You know for a Nintendo dork I got to admit I miss garbage too my Sega genesis batman forever
"3D games allows you to explore and do more" Terraria: *Laughs*
I wonder why when someone shows Hollow Knight most of the time its in King's Pass. Probably because they've already beat the game/ are in the very late game and they have to make another save file to get footage. I mean its a good thing because imagine getting spoiled about some of the stuff in the game. But the person you tell it to probably wont understand what your talking about. And for anyone out there just now playing Hollow Knight, try to get 112%.
Hi
2d gaming is much more chill because there are less things bothering us
Am scoot
Is it me or did Scott precure a new capture kit that retains 60 frames per second?
Are you guys hyped for Lego Skywalker Saga? I'm excited for it I just had to put that out there!
Wait, did people actually say Metroid Dread isn't worth 60 dollars? I'm just going to assume they're angry because the price of the game is higher than their IQ.
Gotta say this is my new favorite “info” type video Scott’s done!
3:02 he says “gam-ing” instead of  “game-ing”
My biggest issue with this debate, is ironically when the Opposite happens, when people say that 3D Games are Lesser than 2D Games! People who say they wanna see series' like Mario, Zelda, & Sonic "Do Something New" but when a Big 3D Entry comes out, it's "not the New they wanted"!
Im greateful for nintendo that Rayman Origins and Legends happened, too bad Ubisoft would rather make copy paste garbage and let Rayman die.
4:45 okay to be fair have you ever tried playing a 2D platformer with the GameCube's dpad it's miserable
Anybody know what the game at 19:20 is called?
This guy is funny 👍🏻
Woz is the best
3:21, Woah, too soon man
Evolution of dlc in gaming.
Scot The Woz: Bad at Sonic games
We do have 4D games like 4D Tools and 4D Cube
ok but like Metroid Dread IS 60 dollars like Scott pleeeez great video though, but i thought that was really funny :P
As an id Software fan seeing the SNES port of Wolfenstein 3D put me in physical pain.
The bank is repossessing my body! 😂
I audibly shouted THANK YOU when you mentioned RE3 remake. After RE2 remake became my favorite game of all time, I was severely disappointed in 3 remake. That game sucks. Least favorite RE I’ve played
2D gaming was huge for me. Super Metroid and Mega Man X was my childhood.
13:25 Super Mario 64? Now that’s something I can worship!
So glad Scott finally talked about MegaManX8. He seemed like the kind of person who would play the X games up until X4, and then give up with X5 or X6.
19:20 Does anyone know what this game is?
Fun fact: every _Five Nights at Freddy’s_ game before the VR one is technically 2D. Similar to the special stages of Sonic 2 and 3, it just uses pre-rendered sprites and backgrounds.
18:02 LET'S GOOO
Hey Scott Y’all here.
Kinda sense Dread would be in this video in one way or another.
Holy shit I thought he was gonna talk about chibi robo whiplash again
Flexing his geometry wars high score
🔫 water guns
If my chair moves that's the forth dimension *Muffled screaming*
3D games (while still relevant to appropriate titles) have mostly been a lazy step. Yes, video games have exploded over the years. I just can't help but wonder how far we COULD be.
What’s the game at 8:26 I’ve been trying to remember for years
The thing is Scott, the idea of 2d = is so ingrained to people, if you price it as $60 it will get murdered! Its a matter of public perception, I blame Nintendo for it.
This was a very elaborate way of telling us to buy Metroid Dread 😋
PEGGLE
it's not moonshine OR porn. it's thirty
I'm bummed that the run & gun genre never made it to 3D.  There were a few attempts when the ps1 first launch but nothing that made an impact like in other genres.
street fighter 3 should have gotten a mention as an absurdly beautiful 2D game
I agree that Metroid Dread perfectly illustrates how far the industry has come and while the mindset of "2D = Less Effort" still persists with gamers. I'm really happy bigger studios are finally taking notice of how 2D is just another avenue for development and no longer any sort of crutch/limitation.
Remember when fighting games like Street Fighter and King of Fighters were trying to shift to 3D because the 3D games were deemed to be the future of the genre?  Yeah, guess who went back to 2D.
Yo... I LOVE SHAPES!
You. Have. JET FORCE GEMINI!!!!!!    Such an underrated game!!!
I think the Steam Deck will be a major boon to 2D gaming
thank you Scott for always putting so much work and polish on your videos, its a treat every week <3
17:04 it has been *0* ScottTheWoz videos since Scott showed or mentioned Chibi Robo Zip Lash
Scott always making phenomenal videos
Nice haircut, scott. But tbh, this is probably my most favorite video for a while since 2D gaming holds dear to my heart.  Thanks, scott. Need more spotlight on Gameboy Advance, my most favorite console ever
I feel like Twisted Pixel doesn't get enough love for their games. Stuff like Splosion Man, The Maw, Comic Jumper, Loco Cycle, & Gunstringer were incredible experiences. I used to see their games get talked about quite frequently, but now they make VR only games it seems and unless I visit their website, their more ambitious titles seems to have way less word of mouth. I presume they're still doing well, as they keep making games, but I never see people talking about Wilson's Heart or B-Team. Splosion Man though is one of the most iconic XBLA games ever made. Guess what I'm saying is, where's Splosion Man Jr damn it!
Geometry Wars and Child of Light <3
1:11 bad example for a good 3D game
I really like the call back to 2d. I genuinely play very little 3d games.
Metroid Dread $60. It will definitely deliver what it's worth. Something we waited for, finally can dive into the next chapter in the series.  2D lives on
Love that he brought up metroid dread so much
I like when you do videos about stuff.
does anybody know the name of the game shown at 2:37? I've been trying to find this game for years
17:34 I think another important reason why so much 2D stopped cutting it was that the casual audience doesn't give you much longevity. There is really no brand loyalty or investment in the medium. Grandma is usually content with buying a single 2D Mario game and calling it a day.
I too love super merrio brothers
I like to think that Scott is just constantly pissed at shit no one cares about and 5 minutes before each episode someone makes an offhand comment that starts a rant
I hoped for a second you'd talk about games like Sonic Colors, where they mix 2D and 3D gameplay, but I understand that it wasn't the point of your video! ☺️
21 minutes of our favorite wozniak
It's still weird having to get used to StW videos no longer coming out on Sunday nights...
“And another 2d game”
Nintendo: oversaturated the 2D game market Capcom: WE GOTTTA DO THAT WITH OUR FRANCHISES!!
I see yaw, using The Legend of Dragoon footage. I remember Burning Rush.
Nailed the whole situation. Great vid!
No, indie junk should be labeled so customers won't be duped into buying them.
Honestly the best part about this video is that Scott never talked about Sonic's transition to 3D and rocks
Yeah, Metroid Dread costs the same as Prime 4. Piss off.
11:00 I laughed air out of my nose there.
What is the game at @10:38
Scott better start listing the songs in the description of his videos again, we don’t want his videos to get claimed
Metal Slug is the reason 2D gaming still has a long way to go.
Scott, 💙 your content.   but....could you lower the audio levels when you SCREAM and YELL so I can listen to your videos without waking up my girlfriend or allow me to use headphones?       James Rolfe does this. It works with great success.
That was the best end gag we’ve had for a bit, I genuinely laughed out loud
Cuphead is on Switch.
Two videos in 5 days? Dang bro!
I can't believe Scott didn't talk about 1D games smh
I am waiting for a new mario bros 2d game for switch.  NSMBU is a port that doesn’t count!!!
Here is the thing... the 3d we see is actually 2d giving the illusion of 3d....   Real 3d is stuff we can touch and feel (what they try to classify as 4d in theme park rides and stuff).  Real 4d is being able to watch 2hrs of content in a second... you can instantly binge-watch an entire season without wasting any time...
Yo
I just realized Scott is basically Morty Smith
You're definitely a lock for the YouTube Hall Of Fame!   Crazy to see how far your channel has come along 🤯
Terraria Vs minecraft always used to come up with my mates with Terraria being seen less of a game being 2d but it won in the end when i got them to play it
Wait Metroid dread is not 60 bones??
That sounds like a Company Man title
Exactly what I needed
I find 3d games to be more empty than 2d because developers have to figure out how to fill the 3d space.  2d games tend to make use of every inch of the screen and rarely feel empty
lol
i love the fact that he don't run out of themes to talk about, it's just great!
So glad I found your channel! Been bingeing your content haha
love when this Massive Legend blesses my time line!!!!
Dunkey Loves This Video.
C'mon, man, most games aren't worth $60. They should all be lower, not the other way.
Shave.
Scott: "It's almost like hand-held games we're treated as spin-offs sometimes even if they had just as much if not more integrity as whatever released on consoles, but the end they just weren't considered as important as console games"  Showing Sonic Advance gameplay.  Me: "He is right!!!"
Man I've never seen a YouTuber advocate for a game to be MORE expensive
I laughed so hard for about a minute "mouse trap incident"  11:00
3D games don't have to cost as much as they do. There is too much unnecessary fluff put in to try and make them look "modern. "3D games back in the early 2000s in my personal opinion had a great balance between gameplay and cutscenes. They didn't really intrude and were a benefit to each other. 3D gaming should allow you to be more immersed in the world and the characters.
Scott the Woz. The best.
I mean, I get the complaint about 2D games not being as expensive, but also, thank god they're not as expensive, they could be even cheaper and I'd be super fine with it
The cut away gag shots felt fairly different from usual, in a good way. This whole episode felt very energetic overall, really nice!
I am still waiting for nintendo to release a brand new, ORIGINAL, 2D Mario game
Syphon filter clip = easy way to get a like
He's going to kill it at that family reunion.
another day closer to a dedicated littlebigplanet video
I feel like Scott is being held at gunpoint to make this episode
Go check out Shane Gillis's new comedy special.  Live In Austin
2:47 Seems like Mr.Scott lacks skill on the "Gaming department"
Unpopular opinion: Super paper mario is the most underrated paper mario game ever
grateful that you mentioned mischief makers
a z-axis is a z-axis. You can't say it's only a half
Indie games. Not sure if I'd play current stuff to this day if it weren't for them.
If 50% of 3D games are filler, then 90% of Persona games are also filler
Fuck I was not expecting to see Onimusha tactics today
I think it’s interesting how the GameCube didn’t have any mainline Kirby game besides Kirby air ride which is 3d. Around this time Kirby gcn was in development and it took 11 years for it to be made. I guess the GameCube was cursed to not have any 2d games like Kirby.
I used to dismiss 2D games. Then I played Ori and the Blind Forest and it made me realise that I was wrong.
A main reason why the 2D revival even occured was due to the products cheap price. That's why it sold far more than its 3D counterpart as people were more able to access it. Trying to artificially inflate the price is going to ruin that and much more. It doesn't incentive the company to do any better either
I’m on a field trip in Washington DC but when Scott posts on new video I ALWAYS answer the call.
LMAO WHAT IS THAT FIFA 22 COVER I'M SUFFOCATING
New video, nice!
THERE WAS A 3D WARIO PLATFORMER!?!?
This is a terrible video. Why is the title 2D when the video itself is 3D?
What's the game being shown at around 10:39?
Scott really just saw all the people complaining about metroid dread being a 2D game for $60 and made an entire video about it.
All games are 2D games if you think about it
I just played Mischief Makers for the first time yesterday and it is whacky. Friend's dad found an N64 with a handful of games for 10 bucks like whaaaat
Can someone pls tell me what dimension pixel ripped is in.
I really appreciate that the word ‘Metroidvania’ was not used in this video.
Glad to know I'm not the only one who appreciates both 2d and 3d games equally.
what a cool guy :)
Count the check marks in the top comments… aaaaaah 1 aaaaaah 2… too many to count.
My Dad once asked me "are there any video games with Dracula in them?" And I proceeded to show him Castlevania on NES and he said "that looks old, they should just give that away for free" I then showed him a trailer for Castlevania Lords of Shadow and he said "Now that looks worth the money". Sometimes flashy aesthetic is worth more in the eyes of a consumer than actual gameplay.
I loved this video, thanks!  Also play antonball, that game slaps
man that guy in Scott's house needs to suck it up and shoot Scott again. he loves just pushing that gun into frame but where's the commitment?
New Scott angle
Babe wake up... New Scott the Woz video
Me after seeing hollow knighy: 0-0
I really wish he didn't stick with Nintendo on going 2D to 3D and vice versa. Companies like Capcom, SNK, Konami and even Sega had to deal with such things too. I get it that he's a Nintendo guy, but to ignore those companies is kinda wierd.
The very first game bet I would have to say that was for 3D for everything no 2D stuff for anything is the game called alone in the dark that came out in 1992 that game I would have to say is the very first 3D one and that was for PC which PC is a console in a way
I have diagnosed for 10 or more minutes of Scott Wozniak. Depression is cured.
Reminder that he’s playing P4G
I remember having a conversation with a GameStop employee as I was thinking about getting Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. I had just recently bought a Switch, and was barely starting to dip my toes into gaming. I told him I was hesitant because it was a full-priced $60 game, and I didn't want to spend a whole $60 on a sidescroller. I know he was simply looking to make a sale, but he assured me it was one of the best of platformers of all time. Later that week, I caved in and bought it, and realized he was absolutely right.  Having an extra dimension does not automatically equate to having good game design. I think it's easy to lose sight of that.
Not only does Nintendo give the same price to 2D and 3D games but they also give the same price to new games and games that came out when the Switch launched.
The End of Game Segregation
when scott puts chibi robo ziplash footage :00000
Thanks Scitt
Where does Rimworld stand on this?
"Metrovania" sounds better that "MetroiDvania" -Change my mind.
Scott: Basically saying 2D is dead  Terraria: am i a joke to you
Half a z is whatever this is <
Yo Scott quiet down, we don’t need game prices to rise for no reason
HOLLOW KNIGHT IN SCOTT THE WOZ VIDEO HOLLOW KNIGHT IN SCOTT RHE WOZ VIDEO
One of Scott best work it’s practically perfection
Anybody knows the name of this game? 19:16
Thanks for breaking the news Scott, R.I.P Abraham Lincoln literally shaking and crying rn he was my favourite game reviewer 😔😔😔😔😭
This is exactly the kind of topic we need Scott for
Any video that talks about Wario Land Shake It is an instant like for me, not enough people even know this game exists and I will praise it until Nintendo ports or remasters it.
God everything in the world sucks and watching Scott the Woz is pretty much the only good thing left.
Scott I speak for everyone with a budged. Stop complain about the prices not being high enough
Thank you for mentioning oddworld
Well you did it again (may I call you max?) You made another masterpiece
I’m so happy to see 2d being a design choice now
5:10 "What is this?, moonshine or porn?"
Who would have guessed a channel with some guy rambling about nintendo would be so good
3:00 "I should know, I wasn't there" 😂
At my school my Gaming Development teacher says he gets motion sickness from 3D games.
15:11 I feel disturbed by new super mario bros Wii having a normal case
i like ur stubble
One of my favorite games is Kunai a 2D retro indie side scroller and another is Mario odyssey which made my holiday season so believe me when I say games is games and games is gud
Even though it was the generation in which 2D games became very rare and mainly put on handhelds in my opinion the 6th generation was where gamming peaked.  As it was before a lot of the the trends like HD gamming started to close down certain levels of studios and before there was major consolidation of the mid grade and bigger studios into others. It was also the time when big studios could seemingly put out a new game every year even multiple in one before HD games put a pin in that
Scott noooo! I like getting my 2d games cheap!!!
we need a scott the woz vr video
That HQ4X filter, tho...8:33
No mention of zip lash huh. Character Development
2D and 3D can coexist. Thank you, Scott… you've restored a bit of my faith in humanity. (Also, made me laugh a lot)
Can someone please tell me the game title for the game @6:19
0:04 Not even a minute in and it looks like he woke up at 4 in the morning to do this particular bit, I love this fuckin guy I swear
You made this video just to talk about Metroid Dread and its price....admit it.
Damn this is good shit. Amazing episode!!
thank you scott for calling out those who said dread isn't worth $60 bc it's 2d
Pretty good video, but no mention of Cloning Clyde. 3/10.
smh can't believe scott's never heard of miegakure, an actual four-dimensional game
Bruh 2 videos in less than a week? That's unheard of
Your videos always make bad days better
Great vid Scott!.... You should do a video on the GameCube Mic and how aweful it was.  Games like Mario Party 6 7 and Odama
19:52 i'm glad it's RE3 Remake if it was RE2 Remake you never want to know as a RE Fan
The way I see it, 2D games exist for the same reason 2D animation still exists. Probably mainly an art style thing, but also there's just types of gameplay that work better in 2D. Cool discussion
I always thought “Smell-O-Vision” was the 4th Dimension…
I hate how the industry as a whole seemed to shun 2d games during the ps1/n64 era forward for over a decade. It's not liked I stopped liking them, hell with symphony of the night, mischief makers and and megaman 8 it just made me love them even more by showing what gorgeous sprite and artwork could be done with the better hardware. Kind of like how the industry just kind of decided that nobody wanted traditional jrpgs anymore and became a rarity outside of handhelds, but are now coming back with a vengeance.
"Xbox exclusive was cuphead"  Me playing it on my classic red and blue switch: Mhm, exclusive to xbox totally
Good Video. Why? I dunno, just is
I bought Peggle last year for nostalgia and I ended up unironically investing ungodly amounts of time to beat it. I love Peggle.
Scott has been improving his humor…AND I LOVE IT!!!
I'm satisfied that, for once, someone with a big audience who decides to talk about Mega Man X8 doesn't shit on it solely because it came out after X7, which completely fucked up the reputation of the series. It's an amazing game, people just can't get over X7 and classify it as a bad game per default.
Should've mentioned how Yooka Laylee 2D vs 3D and game quality. Impossible Lair is a beloved tough platformer
Why am I extremely bothered by the fact that Scott doesn’t have the red case version of NSMBWii, it just looks so weird
Dont give them ideas to charge more because they're better!
1D gaming is on its way, get ready
Donkey Kong: Frozen Ape is my fav 2D game.
What's the game at 12:11? It looks fun
I think the game prices of console release never make any sense, why does it cost 60 dollars to buy a sports game you later need to put more money to enjoy. Steam came and destroyed the prices in the PC world, it's more available, they have it in my currency (ARG pesos) at lower prices, literally you can get triple A games for 10 bucks, indies for less, i got Yakuza Zero for less than a dollar.
But. I’m alive!
Scott, are you okay? You seem to have a floating gun near your head.
Scottus
Yes, the intrinsic value of 2D games should not be lowered merely for the lack of a Z-axis, but its okay with me if the price is cheaper :P
Been here since 36 k subs I knew from the beginning that this guy deserved to have millions of subs
Join the occult dad!
why is he wearing his hood like that
Scott good
scott, i love you, but *please* dont tell nintendo why they should make their games cost more
Good to see Scott’s getting good use out of that prop gun
13:50 Scott! Why did you have to cut the footage off there?!?!
Would it be weird if I mailed a briefcase full of 3D Gameboy Advance games to Scott's home address?
This is such a great video Scott.  It seems like 2D games as of late have been better than big bloated AAA 3D games
I'm confused as to why The Almighty Algorithm only recommended Scott's work to me very recently. It's right up my alley. Like, obviously so.  Weird. Regardless, finding a creator that I really like with a huge backlog of bingeable content, which he has in droves, is one of the simple joys in life.
Some games were best in 2d
But what of 1D
Dkctf is the only 2d game I've played that wasn't just a 2d run through dk land, the game had and still has heart put into it and feels like the world was fully realized even though it's 2d. If anymore 2d dk games happen, have retro do it, they know what they're doing. Oh and have David wise compose the music, his music is pure perfection.
Does anyone know what game that is at 2:37? Looks right up my janky alley.
This is how I feel about traditional 2D vs. 3D computer animation. Every new animated movie looks the same (and ugly).
What’s the game called that’s at 19:16 it looks really good
True talk- Castlevania: Circle of the Moon is a heavily underrated Castlevania game, and it might as well all be because it released in the background of the ?6th? generation of consoles.
One of the best ending gags
Technically time is the 4th dimension. If it’s a 3D object that adheres to the constant of time, it’s a 4d object
Generally speaking, 2d games have less noticeable bugs and glitches and are therefore, (again, generally speaking) more polished experiences.
2D games and 3D games are designed entirely different. Platformers often, in my opinion, work best being 2D. There's a reason why every 3D Mario game now has a way of correcting the direction you're trying to move. Think about this: How does rebounding on enemies like in Hollow Knight translate to 3D? Well, it kind of doesn't. It's much harder to line yourself up above an enemy and go exactly where you want to. In 2D, you can either go forward, or backward. In 3D, you have to adjust based on the camera, plus you have free range to go in basically eight different directions. Meanwhile, a lot of action games tend to work better in 3D. Persona 5 Strikers utilizes some minor platforming to get above enemies and get an advantage, and attacking hordes of enemies, in my opinion, works better in 3D.
people need to give Sonic Advance 1 more attention
16:18 The MCU.
10:38 game?
2D games are also 4D if time is the 4th dimension.
Scott is the Nostalgia Critic of gaming.
20:30 The answer is easy  NONE OF THEM ARE WORTH $60.
Sony of America actively suppressed 2D games shortly after the PS1 launch and this continued into the PS2 and PSP eras. Publishers like Working Designs had to constantly fight them to bring 2D stuff over.
The lack of shovel knight in this video is shocking.
Scott the gunshots happened at alpha waves not sm64, I swear I'll have to make a review soon if I hear 1 more person say mario 64 is the origin of 3d gaming,
I just hate when a franchise is forever stuck in 2d when it has so much potential in 3d or was 3d for a time but waz pushed back into 2d. Examples include pac man, mega man, kirby, donkey Kong, and wario
once again crushing it with the historical prospective of a man twice your age.  fantastic vid 5 knee slaps.
Nice. Tomba.
6:15 Ooooh that looks really good.
Why aren't 2D games priced the same as 3D you say? Thats easy... *Budget* 2D games are much much cheaper to develop than 3D games.
I laugh hard Everytime a gun is pointed at Scott
I always thought 2d was easier while 3d was harder
There’s these videos that try to explain 4D, but this is all I get out of them:  1D: a line 2D: a flat plane, like Super Mario Bros. 3D: X, Y, and Z axis 4D: *headaches and brain hurt I can’t understand this part*
20:22 I cannot express enough how much I agree with this point.
I really enjoyed your video and your about video games 2d Gaming
I honestly think that many games could be translated to 3D with perfection, if it wasn't for the lack of knowledge and practice of developers with 3D games at the time.  Mario 64 changed the series' genre, turning it into Collect-A-Ton instead of platformer. Mario 3D Land/World made the perfect translation of the classic gameplay to 3D and consequently outsold the New Super Mario Bros. series on their respective consoles.  One of the things that got me interested in game design was proving that Sonic (classic), Megaman and Castlevania could be awesome in 3D if their developers knew how to make them.
I loved the wario games got it for Christmas for my wii it was dope
My new fav youtuber
Aww man. This would of been the perfect opportunity for Scott to go 2D again!
13:24 It's stuff like this that makes me love Scott videos. You never know what he'll do for a skit.
60fps? Damn!
Scott the Schnozz, why are you complaining about 2D games being cheaper? Would you rather all games be 60$? I get your point, just because it's 2D doesn't mean it has less value, but still, lets not go and convince developers to increase the prices of their games ok?
today's episode: scott solves racism through video games
Bloodstained Ritual of the Night is such a FUN recent 2D game guys check it out you gonna thank me
11:00  Who else remembers the struggle that was getting Mousetrap to actually work?
2D is definitely better than 1D
Gaming
Scott why are you growing facial hair on your chin
I played RE 2 Remake and loved it. Was 3 no good?
THE SCROLL
Hoo, boy. I remember a book from the 2000s about "Game Art" that referred to pixel graphics as "primitive", only dedicating six pages to them. As such, it discredited the effort required to make 2D art assets, including digitized graphics which actually cost millions of dollars to create per game. The only two games I recognize on the cover are FFX and Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc. The book obviously aged like milk.
Not even 10 seconds in and I’m already laughing my ass off. God I love Scott
I don't know what to comment, now that you've released your Sonic & Knuckles video.
Just sitting down for dinner, hmm wonder what to watch *new scott the woz video is up* Ooh! This just went from a meal to an experience.
0:47 what’s that game called?
1:57 sonic 3d blast isn’t a 3d game it’s a isometric game
There are like 3 youtubers that make me stop whatever I am doing to watch their newly uploaded video. Scott the Woz is one of them, and this video is a perfect example why.
Metroid is absolutely worth $60. Day one purchase for me.
Does anyone know what game that is at 10:38
Holy Shit there is a Mouse trap reference my entire child hood is rushing back to me
After a long sweaty day of high school and football, I just chill and watch a Scott video and eat Spaghetti
But how do you press half an z
See Scott is better because instead of going Rise and Fall he goes Fall and Rise. It’s all about ending with positivity.
Hello everyone Scott is here
SO THATS WHY THE SWITCH EXSIST
Thats another
The rise and fall and rise again
An 2D game that have even or more hours of fun than a 3D one costs less? Better for us I say...
I was only 9 years old when Super Mario 64 was released with the N64 announcement and my dad managed to get it for me on release day. Prior to this game it was only 2D from me, I played the NES for years and then of course the SNES. The amount of mind blow experienced when I first played Mario 64 can't be described, the first true 3D game, it was pretty insane and I don't think I have ever played anything since then that took such a huge leap forward. Zelda OOT was another seriously impressive game, but it came after Mario 64 so it wasn't such a shock.  Looking back on it now, the N64 was a pretty mediocre system with a janky ass controller, but its accomplishment in being the first to really get 3D right, well... it can't be overstated how important this was and how unreal it was for all of us when we first experienced it.
Great video as always Scott!
I would love to marry a man like u
WE MADE IT BOYS, HOLLOW KNIGHT IN A SCOTT VID!
0:56 the irony of this part is the fact that the sm3dw game style in smm2 is actually 3d
Scott would be a witness in court and start off by saying “Hey all, Scott here.”
GAHHH I COULDA WATCHED THIS EARLIER IF I DIDNT TAKE LONG ASS SHOWERS
Scott could do a Yakuza Episode
Scott's videos are just a joke intro with a 20 minute long build up followed by a banger punchline then the little outro jingle. And I love every second of it.
Balls?
I don’t necessarily think that 3D games having moments where “all you do is press up” is a bad thing. Games aren’t purely about gameplay anymore. 3D games have a WAY easier time setting up an atmosphere, and sometimes a calmer atmosphere might require little input from the player. The fact that it took you multiple playthroughs to notice that all you were doing was pressing up at certain times proves this. You couldn’t easily get away with this on a 2D game because they tend to have more limited options on how the world itself can make you feel.  That’s not to say that 2D games can’t have good atmospheres though. Almost all Metroid games, 2D or 3D, succeed in inducing the atmosphere they were going for. All I’m saying is that at least I personally stopped to admire the scenery way, WAY more while playing Breath of the Wild than I did playing any 2D Zelda game.
Scott with a beard scares me. Not that it’s bad but I never see him like that.
this makes me think of how Fire Pro Wrestling Returns was released as a budget title for PS2 in the west during the sixth generation, probably because it was 2D, and ended up being one of the best wrestling games ever made.
dont forget legend of zelda four swords
Dear Scott,  Recently I’ve been really stressed about starting a new school year at a new school. To calm myself down I’ve been watching your videos. You’re able to provide an escape out of what I’m in right now. I don’t even have a Nintendo switch, but every time he talks about it it’s still interesting. Or the wii. Or Ride to Hell. I don’t even know what any of these things are, but you’re able to make it so entertaining. You’ve been so helpful to me these past couple of weeks.  Thank you, Scott
dont you diss castlevania curse of darkness. its a good one.
19:46 scott please no I like my cheap indies
Wait it wasn't a week since the last video how is this possible
Holy fuck Scott the woz
Pre 100k
Can't wait for Scotts videos to become 3D
When will you do videos on the "Choose Your Adventure" Genre? I wanna hear you talk about Henry Stickmin!
20:08 the first mention of youtube in name in the scott the woz cinematic universe
My favourite game of all time is Terraria, a perfect 2D game
I feel touch by ths video. Thanks Scott, you give reason to beleave the prices of 2D games
Not many 2D games translate to online multiplayer and esports outside of fighting games though…
Is it weird that I want Scott to play Spiderman 😭
Hey all, Austin here.  Dropped in to stan Hollow Knight.  Play Hollow Knight.
wait... aberham lincoln is DEAD?????
2D Gaming - The Rise and Fall…And Rise Again
Holy fuck Scott the Woz
Hey Jon I'm mean Scott
Scott clearly has not played 5D Chess with multiverse travel on steam yet.  5D is the future of all games.
It was also 2d animation in movie that got replace by 3D too. Not just games.
True 4D is being able to smell what is on screen. Cause I really want to play metroid prime to smell the guts.
5:11
I’d love to see a 3D donkey kong or wario game again!
19:16 What game is this?
The weakest man in ohio
Im happy i can comment so early when there are on 1 thousand comments
I'm really happy that 2D games haven't completely phased out, I remember how upset I felt that we hadn't seen any 2D Mario games for so many years after Mario Land 2, but at the same time, I do wish that 3D platformers didn't have to decline as a result.  Seriously, all we get anymore is nostalgia bait characters like Sonic, Mario, Crash Bandicoot, and the occasional indie that still cannot restrain themselves from using "remember  N64/PSX games?" as their only way to sell you on their game.  I miss 3D platformers being the top dog.
I too practice what to say in the mirror!      Turns out that I'm so bad at it, my reflection cracked itself...
Justin Womble’s arms apparently had a free weekend to help Scott
Does Kirby Air Ride count as a 3D Kirby game on gamecube?
Scott watches Company Man?
I'll never understand how Mega Man X7 was a flop of 2D to 3D conversion.  Mega Man Legends 1 & 2 knocked it out of the park and they were released a console generation BEFORE X7.
August 28th 1963
Another certified winner
it's scottastic
quality :)
:)
2D games shouldn't cost less,  then complains about how a company churns out 2Ds since they have better profit margins.  then back to they shouldn't cause its not the same for Movies even though stuff that cost more to make generally is priced higher.
Ride to Hell and now this?! It really feels like we've entered a beginning of a renaissance for Scott's comedy. Hopefully I didn't jinx it.
for some reason seeing a game boy color in the back seat by itself is really adorable.
Just saying, Scott: This may be one of your best non-special videos yet.
I feel like Scott is changing. This episode and the last have seemed much more different to me than normal somehow. I'm not saying I think he's changing for the better or for the worst, but somehow he is changing. Could just be in my head, I don't know.
ALIEN HOMINID, SCOTT KNOWS WHAT THE BEHEMOTH IS, OH MY GOD
commenting for algorithm
Hey Scott all here
The end of this video was so good
This video is actually new so I finally get to comment something relevant yes. Until all these Mario + other games and game stuffs reviews I’ve watched recently I actually had no idea nsmb came out before the wii version cause I got the wii one first. Possibly before I got my ds too, I’d have to fact check that though
You are so cute
Scott the fad
Game dev here.  I just need to say that sprite-based games are A LOT more work than 3D ones. Every frame of every animation has to be hand drawn, wheras in 3D you work with models and skeletal animations, so once the groundwork is done, it's pretty easy to tweak and add stuff. Not the case at all with sprite-based stuff.  It's not that we "love" the 2.5D, it's just a lot more realistic to get done.
5:04 Mega Man got a 2D game on GameCube with Mega Man Network Transmission.
Motion rigs for racing games are 4d.
Nothing sums this up better than Metroid Dread and Metroid Prime 4 both coming to Switch.
5:44 to around 6:00. Yeah that’s true but Pokémon was the only exception, it’s held in high high high regards to most enthusiasts.
I can actually imagine Scott walking into his family reunion, sitting at the table with the adults, and starting a conversation on why the Wii u is the misunderstood black sheep of the Nintendo console family. For 40 minutes.
4:58 when those series flashed up I immediately said what about Mega Man Network Transmission for Gamecube?
Just right for my birthday ! Nice video as always!
2D = Pick up and Play 3D = Watch, Wait, and Play (sometimes it loops)
Too bad that the Nintendo Switch suffered the issue of the infamous Joy Con Drift thus I rather play 2D games over 3D as long as it does not use the Control Stick(This is why I'm disappointed with Link's Awakening Switch since it does not have the option to use the D-Pad). This is why as a Switch owner, I rather play Super Smash Bros Ultimate(As I'm using a Power-A type Gamecube Controller there), Mega Man 11, Bloodstained Curse of the Moon games, and Cyber Shadow over anything on Switch. Still, I have to check Joy Con Controller constantly to make sure that it does not drift ever slightly since I've used them for Super Mario Odyssey & Link's Awakening Switch before. SERIOUSLY! WHY IS IT SO HARD FOR NINTENDO TO DO THE MAJOR FIRMWARE UPDATE JUST GIVE US THE OPTION TO DISABLE THE CONTROL STICK(At a cost of not playing any games that uses the Control Stick) JUST TO AVOID THAT FUCKING DRIFT!
To me Nintendo is the Apple of video games to be honest. AND I LOVE IT
Scott made this video just to be a Nintendo fanboy and defend Metroid Dread's price tag. I'm kinda disapointed ngl
5:31 that hurts me so much for some reason
Another and another and a sister and a brother
Reject humanity return to monke Reject 3D return to 2D
I love how 2D has been revitalized to such an extent. There’s this creativeness to making a 2D game in recent years, how they have been polished tirelessly and now, in the right hands, it just clicks into place and you get instantly hooked in this feel-good ride that you know is gonna be special from start to finish. Last time I had this was with Kirby Planet Robobot and I cherish that experience greatly.
What is this moonshine or porn?? My new Favorite Scott the Woz quote
Bruh I literally just practiced talking to someone in the mirror and fucked up my wrist slamming my fist down on the table
Ofc this is about Metroid Dread. Those people are so delusional. Judge the game by quality not the dimension it's using
On the topic of 2D games.....PLAY PHOENOTOPIA: AWAKENING, PLEASE!  If you like Metroidvanias/Souls-like games, Phoenotopia: Awakening is a MUST-PLAY.  It revolves around a young orphan named Gail who goes on a journey across the world to find out what happened to all the adults in her village after they were abducted by a mysterious force. Story's decent enough to carry you through to the end, but the gameplay is really where it's at. It's hard as balls, but the good kind of hard, like Zelda II, the earlier Castlevanias, and Dark Souls, where the satisfaction you feel upon beating a difficult boss/section is downright orgasmic. And if you find a section too difficult, there's a bunch of accessibility options to make it easier on yourself! Highly recommended. It's available for all 3 systems (PS4/PS5, Switch, and Xbox One/Series S + X) and PC.
Holy shit scott the woz
Scott is so on point!
14:50 "great animation"   *shows* *wario* *twerking*
0:48 Unless you count time as a dimension (which would make 3D games actually 4D and 2D games actually 3D), 4D is just a math thing that only exists on paper
You can’t just continue to make videos and not acknowledge the fact that you make your videos on crash bandicoots Pants
What's the game at 10:39? That sprite work is purdy.
I did a bit of fact checking and all signs do in fact point to Lincoln being dead.
1:10
Hello RPG guy.
"Were did everyone go?" They're at home playing 2D Mario!
Just love getting home to a Scott video!
Sooooo, 2-D has a lower floor, but also a lower ceiling. 3-D has a higher floor, but a higher ceiling.
1:27 he is just like the stonks meme but replaced with graphics lol
Everytime a good Youtuber uploads all the clout chasing checkmarks climb out of their shell.
This video was great, definitely my favorite in a while. Well done :D
I’m early
That ending was so clutch lol 😂
I mean, there is that one game that has an environment that’s a 3D projection of a 4D space.  You shift which planes or axis you’re walking through in 3D.
Two words: *Indie Games*
I'd say 3d and 2d games started playing on the same field with the Wii console generation and the DS. The points for the Wii were mentioned in the video, but the DS started putting 2d and 3d on the same level around the same time, like having both Super Mario 64 DS and NSMB. This equal importance was further emphasized on the 3DS with Super Mario 3D Land and NSMB2, N64 Zelda remakes and A Link Between Worlds just to name a couple
Huh I was watching company man before this and now Scott's new vid has a title similar to his videos. Scott, are you stalking me?
i despise the modern era of play station 3d's the same fucking loading screen
Scott’s having a lot of fun with disembodied arm wearing long sleeves
Hey all scotts there
"Hey all, Scott here."  These words provide us with the constancy we need.
6:33 *Scott mentioned Secret Agent Clank -- my life is complete!*
Scott is on my top 3 YouTuber list right next too dunkey and angry joe
scott getting it?
My favorite 2.5D game is the breakout minigame in 3D Dot Game Heroes.
Speaking of 2d games play rimworld I want to watch you suffer
Holy fuck Scott the woz.
Can anyone tell me the 8 bit music playing during the middle video talking about xbox 360?
Just like how 2D animation movie are disappearing 2D games are disappearing
11:01 From the creators of board James, we present board scott!
This video was just to talk about people whining about metroid dread being 2d
1:10 jeb bought a gun… for murder…
does anyone know what the game at 10:38 is? it looks sick
I guess it’s Sunday now
You know what i really love about this video and Scott's comedy in general? The beautiful simplicity of the family reunion joke. You have the setup in the beginning, the reinforcement in the middle (Dad, pay attention), and the payoff at the end. Just S tier writing right there
“2D games are easier to develop.” Cries in game dev
No lie, Wario Land: Shake It has, without exaggeration, the single best ending of any video game I have ever played. Amazing game, amazing animation, absolutely genius ending.
Scott should do an undertale episode
Thanks scott
2d games along with proprietary memory cards were the reason the ps vita failed.  There, I said it.
Scott The Woz had a rough time ever since the move to 3D
Scott The Woz idea: Speedrunning
What a nostalgia inducing video
Which game is at 10:40 ?
We need to talk about how amazing co-op gaming is
Was I suppose to put on my 3D glasses to watch this video?
I feel like one other factor that wasn't touched on was Flash games during the early 2000's. There were so many 2D Flash platformers that you could find online during the GameCube/PS2 era, and I think a lot of those games heavily influenced my taste in gaming as a kid.   Just with 2D Mario platformers alone there were a crazy amount, which I think also helped to sort of minimize that gap in the 2D Mario drought during the early 2000s.
Nice stain, Scott.
Scott has diarrhea ??
Yeah fuck that Space Invaders collection price!
Cutscenes aren't fluff. I don't understand people's vendetta against cutscenes. They're respite from the gameplay, they're an opportunity to tether you to the story and characters, it's an opportunity to bring focus on the story and characters by developing them in the spotlight, it's an opportunity to do interesting things that can't be done in gameplay, and much much more. If you played the game already sure by all means skip em you've seen em before they've done their job but don't sit there and disrespectful them the first time through.
Is that the guy who owns Sonic Jam?
The ending got me SO HARD
just noticed that ever since borderline forever the pepto bismol bottle is empty
Drinking challenge: this comment section but everytime u see a checkmark take a shot
"Mario 64 Defined 3d gaming" - Someone who has never owned a PC in their life.
Aw... he didn't talk about Celeste again.
Loved that joke about the accidental slur. You're a good guy.
From someone who was 11 or 12 when Mario 64 came out, I can tell you it was mind blowing for the time. Spent every weekend at my best friends house sleeping over and running his N64 non-stop for 20+ hours at a time.
Scott the Woz in 2D
You should check out rain world. It's a kick ass 16 bit open world survival game with movement i have never seen in a 2d game and has AI that is borderline alive. It's only 20 dollars on switch and steam and is a beautiful game
I've never enjoyed both disagreed with and enjoyed a funny internet man so much as Scott
While I have no qualms with smaller games being 60$, I have issues when a smaller game is 60$ on Nintendo consoles specifically. I can expect a game to go down in price regularly on other platforms but on Nintendo's consoles are pretty much doomed to 60 unless the stars align and I happen to know about the sale. Like Metroid Dread being 60 isn't an issue, the issue is that it'll stay 60
I'm still waiting for Scott to make a 22 minute video on the L Button.
I swear, Scott can make a video about anything video game related
please mention tropical freeze please mention tropical freeze pl
I’m gonna cough on your doorknobs if you don’t make more videos like the ride to hell one, that was the funniest video I’ve seen in years
Im a big fan of this new "ominous hand that seems to live with scott" character
There is an actual 4d game called "4d toys", where you interact with 4d objects
Scott you ever heard of quake?
pee pee poo poo
*"AND ANOTHER"* -Scott the Woz, 2021
Love all your videos Scott. You could talk about paint drying and id listen. I agree I love 2d and 3d but needs to be balance and not too many of either
OK, who's going to tell Scott Cuphead is available on all platforms?
but you can use the gameboy advance player for gamecube
I'm more excited for Metroid Dread than I ever will be for Prime 4.  I'll always prefer 2D to 3D when it comes to Metroid.
If I remember correctly Super Bomberman R was like.... 54 USD at launch or something like that yeah right, I'll pass. This thing would have been 10 bucks, 15 bucks max (or 1200 Microsoft Points, yeah remember when that was a thing) on Xbox LIVE Arcade.
On my TV this video said it came out tomorrow
celeste was one of the best 2D games in my opinion.
what was Zaxxon?
as someone whos played and knew video games my whole life how have i never heard of wario land shake it. it looks SO amazing.
Scotty
alot of those 3d games back then really werent that good, the 2d ones were alot better, especially the n64/ps era. They have not aged well but Ill play those 2d gba castlevanias
What is the game at 10:39
I love keeping track of Scott's best "out of context" moments
0:04: scott to Chibi robo ziplash
Day 108 of asking Scott The Woz to do the rhythm heaven games
Ty
dude just let us have cheaper games
thanks, now today went from ok, to oke but with even more not less scott the woz
Day 7 of asking scott to do the psp video
What’s this upload schedule lmao. Solid videos though.
I’m all horny and shit thank you Scott
Where is Gex, it started as a 2d game.
when he said hey all i knew this was a good video
I'm glad scott knows that only weird aunts say "mary-oh"
If 2D games start getting more expensive im blaming scott
That was fast!
Meanwhile everyone knows Pokémon handheld games, but then... the f*ck is an XD?
2d games are actually 3d, and 3d games are actually 4d, because they both have the dimension of time.
EARRAPE WARNING AT 16:22
Damn
Daddy Scott is back
9:03
Speaking of 2d stuff, everyone seems to want breath of the wild 2 but I’m over here just wishing for a new 2d zelda
8:21 that was the saddest Peggle shot ever
i think i'll always gravitate more towards 2d games so i'm super happy to see them back in the limelight.  & for the lapse in 2d mario games, we also got super princess peach a couple of months before new super mario bros.! not sure if that counts exactly... but gotta rep peachy 👑
And no love for 1D games.
Wario Land: Shake it! ... Or The Shake Dimension if you lived in Europe. ........... Or just Shake if you live in Japan! _blows a gasket_
Skipping that Star Coin at 13:45 hurt me way more than it should have...
“Stage play!”  I see what you did there.
Join us on today for a good day to help us with your new update please let us know if we need anything more fun to join you and join the game free app and free free game free app for your self and fun free free kick that kid is fun game
Scott, you forgot to adjust the levels when you started layering your voices for the "and another" gag. My ears are bleeding.
Eyo where's the z axis I can't believe ppl these days smh
Finally someone talking about this disgusting era of gaming
YeS
A lot of jabs at 3D Sonic lately, Scott are you hinting at something?
Thr title should be "The rise and fall and rise of 2D games." Like a Phoenix it rose from its own ashes. Or the stock market.
Big W Scott, always delivers grade A videos!
I'm just glad we're finally getting a fairly consistent output of both 2D and 3D high quality games. There could always be more 2D games it just needs to be different kinds of 2D games.
scott
Pog 69000 person to see
That last joke! Way to pull it all together. Bravo Scott.
Doom baby
Dementia is back again!!!
GUYS! I FINALLY GET IT! 2D platformsers are Jesus Christ
Why do I get the feeling that he started writing this episode because people were saying that Dread isn't worth $60?
Why do feel like Metroid Dread is actually going to be the pinnacle of this current 2D renaissance
55 minute crew
Yoshi’s new Island wasn’t even that good of a game
Love the point you make in this video. I was listening to a podcast earlier today where the host said Metroid Dread looks "cheap" because it's 2.5D. I'm just like... How???
Another banger, honestly inspiring that you can keep up the quality for so long with every indication that you won’t be stopping. Love ya
I straight up thought you were joking about Grand Theft Auto Advance, I had never heard of it haha
fuck yes
you going past the star coins in new super mario bros hurts me
16:22 Audio representation of Scott describing the amount of problems that he has with Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash
He had me at “Hey all”
I noticed Scott likes to upload when I order pizza  That means it's a special occasion! 😌
I'd never really thought about it, but it is definitely interesting how Nintendo only calls back to home console releases. As someone who grew up primarily only playing handheld games (and I'm sure I'm not alone in that), seeing the bunny ears from Super Mario Land 2 return would have me way giddier than the Tanooki suit coming back for the nth time
Here's to gaming if it's 2D, 3D or 4D, 5D, 6D any D just enjoy!!!  Great video as always Scott.
scott has a beard wtf
I honestly prefer 2D games on a handheld, idk why but to me they just feel better. Maybe its cuz i grew up in the era when 2D games were only on GBA/DS idk.
10:38 what game is this? looks fun
Scott talking about handheld games: “But in the end they weren’t considered as important as Console games    Kingdom hearts: “Let me do what they call a PRO gamer move”
Hoje é domingo no Brasil valew por postar
1.1k comment
Just finished
WBAMO! Finally early
what is the game at 0:47?
Hi Scott
Scott i love you
Scott you've done it again, the best YouTuber around always top quality content
Nothing is funnier than Sonic forces costing twice as much as Mania
If Ubisoft is watching this, could you please make a third Rayman game?
Reminds me of when the DS was new, as a kid I worried about its ability to do 3D games possibly meaning the end of 2D games. Consoles certainly weren't doing many 2D games at the time, and so it seemed like "progress" was going to mean 2D games got forgotten. Fortunately I was very wrong, and today 2D games are as good as ever.
AND ANOTHER
The 3DS having too much 2D is a statement I was not ready for.
the man has put oddworld in a video
Where is my fellow 1D gamers 😎😎😎🤙🤙
You should do a video on the Conduit for Wii!
Bro I don’t know what to do now that I know Metroid 2 sold more than Super Metroid
Bad argument there about 60 dollars being too much for 2d games. Its not that 2d should be cheap, its that copy paste remakes like Link's Awakening should NOT be full priced. Metroid Dread is a brand new full fledged game from the ground up so full price at launch makes sense.  The price never going down because "nIntEnDo" is another story.
Who else prefers the old top down pokemon games (gen 5 and before)
i find it funny how scott thinks wolfenstein 3d is in a 3d engine as well as doom
It costs around 20$ to get the z-axis to feature in a game. Z-Axis has a busy schedule
I like Scott
i hope he makes a video on persona 4 haha
Hi
Scott: *being held at gunpoint during most of the episode for seemingly no reason*
Okay Scott, but the Diamond and Pearl remakes are still not worth $60
Out of all the things in this video, my biggest surprise was seeing Onimusha Tactics. I have never seen or heard a single person mention this game in my entire life. Thank you Scott. Now I know the game isn't a fever dream
Finally a use for my 2€ 3d phone goggles
Mischief makers was the shit.
i literally came from watching another Scott the Woz video before watching this one.
I think the real question is if any game at all is worth sixty dollars. If you need to price it at that point to make back your money then maybe your budgets have ballooned out of control.
The thumbnail has NSBWII at the top and not any of the future titles  Perfect.
I just find 2D games to be a more tight and polished experience overall. There are absolutely examples of 2d games that put in the bare minimum; but when a developer goes all in on 2D it feels like so much more complete of an experience than 3D games tend to.  When 3D games go all in, we get things like horse testicle physics.  How does that make the game more fun?  If I wanted to look at horse genitalia, I’d go work on a Ranch.  That isn’t to say there are not ways for developers to make a better 3D gaming experience if they put in the effort; but too often it feels like that effort is to stroke their own egos, make excuses why they’re working on this, engaging with their weird fetish, or all of the above.  Like seriously, who green lit the amount of time spent on horse testicle physics in Red Dead?  And what pervert thought that was worth drawing our attention to?  If that’s your kink, you do you.  Just keep it in the bedroom between you and a consenting horse.
This guy is from Boston
Being a fan of Scott the Woz is like being a fan of Connoreatspants.
Hey Scott, All here!
60,236th.
Scott the Goat
Why is there NO MENTION of Megaman Legends!!
Scott: "2D games should cost as much as 3D games." Me: "Hold up, let me buy Metroid Dread first!"
“DIMENSIONS THATS MY FAVORITE”  -A legend
I want a mario clash remaster on switch
This was just an ad for Metroid Dread
Good watching Scott in the first 1 hour
He's Back
day 1 of asking Scott to do an episode on hat in time
Scott early this week. Yayyyy!
The original Quake and Mario 64 were the 2 games that truly defined 3D gaming
Nah, Metroid Dread's price is just being compared to the indies in the same genre.
The bank is repossessing my body!  — that's literally my favourite joke so far.
2:50 Klonoa spotted!!!
Dres should be 60. It’s looks like it was made for 3DS
4:34 every time schott the wozniak does the scary spongbog mucis I'm always so scaryed. Sckott you're skary sounds
when he told me to pay attention  I paid attention
I usually skipped hanging out with friends to watch the premiere of new episodes on Sundays, but now I have to keep a finger on my 'cancel plans' button when Scott decides to upload on a weekday
As an Xbox One apologist and Series X owner, it would have been nice if MS had valued physical releases of those niche 2D and indie games the last gen. Seeing a slight resurgence now, but if that's your jam it's clear Switch and PS4 is the way to go.
What if we only advanced in 2d gaming
A good example was Spongebob BFBB  What did we got on the GCN?   A 3D Platformer  What did we got on the GBA?  A 2D Platformer
Now this is quality entertainment
2037: the rise and fall of 3D gaming and the rise of 4d
Can you cover sonic colors ultimate  on the nintendo switch
When Scott said "and another" it was as if I was watching a spiritual successor to AVGN with the Pong consoles.
Thanks Scott. Now Nintendo’s going to make me pay 60 bucks for a port of Bill Walsh College Football.
When’s the rise of 1d
Don't worry Scott, I don't think any game is worth $60
*T h e s e* game*s* *D o n ' t* Blow
Scott, i want you to crush me so that i can be the superior 2d. I don't wanna be 3d anymore.
I absolutely love the Wii I grew up with it even though I did not get a Wii U it made me love my Wii even More
If aliens ever come to earth, ill probably elect Scott to make first contact
“The Bank is Repossessing my body “  - Scott the owner of multiple copies of flingsmash Woz
Paper mario was 2d and on n64 era bud
Groovy video!
Street Fighter 4 brought back fighting games popularity and made the 2D/2.5D plane popular for them again. PS3 360 era was good
love scott's videos because they're entertaining enough for me to not only not need to play a rhythm game while they're on in the background, but also not be able to
One of your greatest hits scotch
Mmm gotta love peggle!                                                     The rest of the video is really good as well! Good job as always scott!

My personal timestamp, made me laugh way harder than it should've. 5:08
Klonoa 2 on the PS2 was a 2.5D masterpiece.
I would find it really funny if Nintendo aired a Nintendo Direct without telling anybody, and all the streamers would have to scramble to get their reactions in.
Scott when scott
Absolutely great video!!! I was literally just playing hollow knight before watching this and it made me think about the game even more than before.
Where’s flingsmash in this video?
One of the best modern 2d games is being sold for 15€ since release. That game is worth more than 60 eeeaaasssily.   Hollow knight, it's hollow Knight
4:01 you clearly haven't seen Kirby's Blowout Blast
1:19 Why is Kirby Star Allies bigger than Shovel Knight and Ori? I assumed the latter were more popular?
In middle school 3D was the future. Then it came. Mostly sucked. Then good. Then I said these games take too long. Ah, my 2D is back. Nice.
What if Scott was in the next Board James?
Hey I stand in front of a mirror and practice what to say!
Lol
Next up Hugh neutron
19:40 don't know what the hell happened with the audio editing but Scott will probably delete the video to fix it
but, its, TOOSDAY
I kinda agree with Scott on this one but it’s if you make a fun and competent game it is worth the money
Scott I think someone is trying to kill you. Just a heads up
If 2D games were relegated... That means.... They are in the Championship. They'll be back in the Premier League next season, mark my words.
You know scott i don't watch your videos  for your opinions i watch them for *actually funny* jokes
Hey now, Scott. Don't give Nintendo any ideas of jacking up their prices on 2D games 😬
1000th
Kirby knows the third dimension exists but refuses to to look that way at any cost.
HECK YEAH NEW SCOTT VIDEO!
Finally someone who appreciates Wario Land Shake It
I swear, every video from Scott brings laughs. I never thought he could do so much with his concept, but look at what a fool i am. Amazing job per usual Scott, my favorite YouTuber!
Don’t give Nintendo any ideas to charge more for their games lol. They’ll never go on sale
Hello
Mario 64 may have been the catalyst, but GTA 3 was what everyone wanted.
I miss 3D platformers
What is that game at 10:39? The graphics look beautiful and the gameplay looks awesome too
Scott could talk about the history of drywall for 45 minutes and I'd watch it
Every single Scott video never fails to make me laugh within the first 5 seconds
Trade secret: Most modern games that claim to be entirely 2D are actually still 3D. Player may not see or use the Z-axis themselves, but it's always there, and being used by the game for something.
Scott played persona 4 golden and that makes me happy
Hey scott. Lately I've been playing far more multiplayer games than I used to, and I found myself losing the love of the medium that I had before that. So I started watching you again and it's been really helpful in reminding me why I love games. Thanks.
Ahhhh, history class.
Not even 10 seconds in and im already cracking up. Love this man!
loved this, but it kinda felt like you were repeating your point over and over
Spam "0" key 😂😂
He is def getting Metroid dread
Goemon's Great Adventure & Iggy's Wrecking Balls were 2.5D.
Scott, if you are being held hostage, type "Blink" twice
He is literally the reason I started a channel. Thanks for the awesome content.
Thank You for all of your videos that you did. I am enjoying all of them
1D is too much for me to handle.
The family reunion joke holding up until the end was amazing
Glad to know someone else also rehearses that phrase too😂
Yay
Games being cheaper is a good thing, Scott. Metroid Dread should be cheaper because cheaper is good.
I keep hoping 6 golden coins will get the links awakening treatment
the bank is repossessing my body lol
0:00 yes
Hell yeah new Scott The Woz episode! Time to bring out my enchilada's!
Doom is my favorite 2d game
Hey Scott Something here
Not sure if this channel is a one man band or not. But if there is a person behind the curtain editing all this content.... Good job.   If it's Scott... Also good job.
Nitrogen Studios Lmao
Going from an AVGN binge to this episode feels like a proper evolution
“I should know, I wasn’t there” “You know what they say, go fuck yourself”
30 secs in and im in love with the framing device of this 20 min video being a whole quote at the picnic
this confirms that scott has played plants vs zombies on the xbox
7:05 Scott, the *fully 3D Need for Speed GBA games* would like a word with you, same with Top Gear Rally on the GBA. Asterix and Obelix XXL on GBA was a fully 3D platformer. Don't say the GBA couldn't proper 3D.
10:45
I think it's worth mentioning that Mega Man _did_ in fact get a 2D platformer in the 6th generation, a spinoff of the _Battle Network_ series on the GameCube called _Mega Man Network Transmission._
I turned 10 the same year Super Mario 64 came out, so it's so surreal to me that popular gaming Youtubers like Scott here or Caddicarus either weren't born yet or were very young in 1996. How time flies.
Could someone PLEASE send a link to the horn sound effect used in 4:35
10:51 Scott: These Movies Have the Same Price as Poltergeist Of Borley Forest. Poltergeist Of Borley Forest: *is Cheaper than Infinity War on DVD*
11:10 this is a huge pet peeve of mine with those cinematic AAA sony-type games. and for 2d, its on the same level as "i hate how so many 2d games are trial-error rougelikes" for me
Great family reunion Scott, I'm happy to see you love fucking polygons.  But have you played any games lately?
Unless you count 3D Land and 3D World, I've never finished a 3D Mario games. Finished all the 2D ones however.
GAMING IN THE TITLE!!!!!
I hope the gun is the new member of the group
4:50 should have been "get in the car ,shut the front door"
Video Game Soundtracks - Scott The Woz
I genuinely did not see the outro joke coming and that is absolutely fantastic! Side note, always great to see Viewtiful Joe get some love, even if only for a couple seconds.
I see, this is a subtweet to that idiot who said "Metroid Dread is not worth 60 bucks because it's 2D"
You're wistful
I'm still waiting for Yoshi's cookie to release on the Wii U.
The Metroid series is a good example for me of 3D games being more memorable than their 2D counterparts even though the 2D counterparts have better gameplay. The Metroid prime series, is beloved for their story, environments, in the sheer scale of epicness that they contain. I was blown away with Metroid prime hunters, having that fidelity of 3D gameplay on a handheld. Metroid prime 3 corruption was gripping in every way. And I've played the 2D Metroid games as well, there are fun, enjoyable from beginning to end, but I don't remember too much about them.
I don't remember this episode...AH ITS NOT SUNDAY
When scott uploads it's lit
Peggle 🥴
Boo. Get jumpscared.
Love when Scott gets dementia
You’re videos are amazing
Holy fuck, scott the woz
I totally agree. We can clearly see that 2D games are now equally as good as 3D especially with Metroid 5 (the Dread one), Wario Ware Get it Together and a bunch or other great games!
Its so cool to see how confident Scott has become over the years. Keep up the great vids man :)
Florida Man makes so many appearances in this video. I might make a list of all of them.
Join the occult, Dad!
I laughed way too hard at 'is this moonshine or porn'
Nintendo in the mid to late 2000s :” We’re bringing back 2d Mario after being absent for over a decade “  Fans:”YEAAAAAAHH”  Nintendo:”And it’s gonna be all we really do with the franchise for next half a decade “  Fans:”DANGIT”!!!!
How times have Scott said “It wasn’t the first 3D game, but it might of well have been “ he says it like every time he talks about Mario 64
0:46 Ever played Blinx the time sweeper? Time is often referred to as the 4th dimension and that cat made time his b!tch. If that's not a true 4th dimension game then I don't know what is.
I had a weird woz itch BOOM He posted a vid
Wario Land Shake It is the most beautiful 2D game I've ever seen. (Well, maybe tied with Hollow Knight). I wish it were more successful.
18:43 Wait, what makes a game on the 3DS any different from a game on the Switch?
At this point, Scott can talk about the C stick on a 3ds and make it unbelievably entertaining to watch.
3D games have a lot of additional toolsets to really help with development. Not saying there aren't 2D toolsets, but nothing as powerful as something like the Unreal engine. Thankfully I enjoy gaming no matter how many Ds there are.
14:48 great animation
Quake came out like 2 day before sm64
That was the best description of a family reunion I've ever watched
10:05 i think Scott just solved racism
New Scott the Woz vid? My medication can wait
Surprise Scott the Woz uploads are the best
i get out of a shower and i see this video
I wish stuff like the Xbox live arcade came back in modern consoles, I like the vibe, the price, the titles released for it, I miss it so much
Nice, a Scott The Woz video on my birthday
“Warioland had great animation”  Shows Wario casually twerking
I'm glad 2d fighting games didn't disappear. Tekken is great but there's always room for Street Fighter and Guilty Gear.
Im really glad he put Peggle in this video, it was a really great game that I feel like no one played
ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY WOZ  ARE KING AND GOD   FOREVER  AT LEAST UNTIL  F-ZERO GETS A NEW GAME  FROM RISE TO SET  TO START TO END  ALL HAIL ARE MIGHTY LORD  SCOTT THE WOZ
Most of my favorite games are 2D games.
Am I the only person that didn’t know a fucking 3d platforming game featuring fucking wario was a real life thing. I’m shaking
Wario Land Shake It truly does have great animation.
Shhh don’t give the big game companies ideas
Metroid dread costs 60 tho...
10:25 spelunky!!!!!!!!!!!
Scott showed Celeste at 11:35. My life is complete
Scott The 2D Woz
I love 2d or 2.5d games. Then again, I have no depth perception.
I don't know if its just me, but I get the impression that Scott doesn't quite understand that smaller game budget = game sold for lower price
12:59 Does it ever just make you smile when you hear things like this
"The most iconic Xbox one exclusive in my opinion was..." Me: "Ori?"  "CUPHEAD"  Oh
Scott. Thank you for remembering smash tour. I thought I was the only one that acknowledged its presence.
I feel this video was specifically in response to Metroid Dread’s controversy being $60 and being “overpriced”. Even more than the explicit mention at the end there.
but what about the L dimension?     y'know, cause I'm still waiting for Scott to talk about the L button
13:24 and there's the money shot of this ebesode
HOLY SHIT SCOTT REFERENCED PEGGLE NO FUCKING WAY
Noooo don't tell Nintendo 2D games are worth 60 then they'll actually charge us 60 :0
Sonic Mania is worth 20 bucks and Forces is worth like 40 bucks or something ludicrous. Like how's something with such passion and love put into it worth less than a game that's basically just a bad movie with how little gameplay it has to offer.
I could listen to Scott talk about the L button for hours and not get tired of it
His assistant is gonna be in every video now isn’t he
Scott I wanna just say, even if this understandably gets lost in the comments: The informative/deep discussion you do like this are some of your best videos and I love just how passionate and great they are. This topic in particular is one of my favourites talking about friends with and especially trying to understand and you did this so much justice delving into it as much as you did.  Thank you Scott for being such a great content creator, keep being you man 💙
“Hey all, Scott here”  *I’m not crying, you’re crying*
Love it
When nintendo fans were complaining about metroid dread being 60$. The sentiment still exists today
Scott uploading always makes my day better :)
Scott I would love if you made a video dedicated to cuphead. It is one of my favorite games!
what is the game at 10:41
“What is this moonshine or p^^n?” Scott, 2021
Love how Scott got 35k views In 25 minutes on a video he posted that he posted at 8:00
Mischief Makers mentioned
Upload schedule? Pfffftt...
His videos are always too funny
10 seconds in and we already have a really good joke in the jokebook, 21 minutes in and we have a ton. Always love videos from Scot Woz, awesome video :D
Scott is always so 2.5d
Isn't this that guy who played 5 hours of persona 4 golden and liked it?
Oh man I actually laughed at the end line. Fucking excellent.
Sussy baka
Hey Scott all here
M
wait Lincoln died, I thought he was still kicking like Jimmy Carter
I am satisfied. Make a video about Gex next
Guns: The Episode
12:30 - Something's telling me Scott's hiding something... a flashcard perhaps?
YeaHHHHH
I grew up on the snes/genesis era. I prefer the 2d games. There is a charm to them 3d doesn't pull off
Hey y’all Scott here
I'm a simple woman. I see Scott's uploaded a video, I drop everything to watch.
Make a Face Raiders video
Scott Got Dementia Again
The fact that 2D and 3D Metroid is happening on Switch is unreal! Great vid Scott
“I miss garbage “  - Boomers stuck in the past
So Scott just uploads randomly now?
When Scott gets on a random upload schedule:
The humor on this Video in particular is incredible
:)
Man why is that guy threatening our boi Scott with Gex!
whats your favorite wikipedia article
that was such a good episode of scott the woz on family reunions :)
Scott complains that 2D games don’t charge enough money CHILL OUT OR THEYLL CHANGE IT
That tarrey town theme 👌
Scott waiting for 2.75D
"Super Mario 64 _defined_ 3D gaming.  It existed beforehand, but... did it?" *Ultima Underworld has entered the chat* *Catacombs 3D has entered the chat* *Ken's Labyrinth has entered the chat* *Hovertank 3D has entered the chat* *Wolfenstien 3D has entered the chat* *Doom has entered the chat*
Was just watching older videos 5 minutes ago💀
Dammit Scott I had stuff to do! What am I gonna do for the next 20 minutes?? Oh yeah.
why am I tearing up at a Scott the Woz video...
one day scott will learn kirby isn't a nintendo game, one day
While I would agree in the 60 sales price of it could prove to me that that title in question was worth as not all 2d games r made equal
Already excited to see the guy with the gun’s face reveal in borderline forever 2
I fully support Scott uploading past Sunday as it allows him to take his time on the videos and produce better stuff for us to watch
I relate to developmental issues.
I dont think its necessarily true that developing for 3d is cheaper than 2d overall. 3d games can be simple and 2 d games super complex, it just tends to not be this way because 3d offers some unique possibilities (2d does too in its own way, they are just harder to conceive and develop) Good pixelart is extremely hard and expensive for example
Well said
Very cool
Metroid Dread is coming.
It's now officially canon that Scott's Aunt is Bob from Wulff Den
had a shitty day, this made it better.. thanks scott...
“Alright kids we’re going to a family reunion, but I must warn you if a guy starts talking to you about the Z Axis… run.”
I think 2.5d is stuff like LittleBigPlanet, where its 2d but with layers
0:46 that does not look like what it’s supposed to be
I wish Scott was 2d
Funny how when you said, "gunshots were heard," and then my charger fell off my table as the gun sound effect went off
I still don't know if Scott likes games from the Wii U or not
Up next: Metroidvanias
4:22 i remember playing this on the computer in 2012
Metroid Dread is definitely worth the 60$
Is it just me, or does it look like he's sitting more center to the camera rather than the right side of the camera?
PEGGLE PTUESDAY
New Scott on my birthday, fire
Scot got an expensive ass camera
Sometimes if I’m busy and I see Scott uploads and I’m busy I’ll just watch the first joke.  This one did not disappoint.
Scott’s upload schedule lately is just
2 full uploads in 7 days, WHAT
What's the game at 10:37?
As he was about to segway into the family reunion joke, I really thought he was just going to replay the same scene of him telling someone to go f**k themselves.
Now this was definitely a “Hey All” episode.  Last week was a “Hey Ya’ll” but today was a return to the classic.
Of course Lincoln’s dead, Scott killed him
Scott the woz talks about dimensions after chris chan got arrested. Is this part of the merge?
0:05 Fooni moment
What's with the gun?!
I bought new super Mario bros. but didn't like the 3d graphics. Mario Maker was a Godsend.
I'm sending this video to all those idiots who think Metroid Dread isn't worth $60 because it's 2D. And yes, I said idiots and I refuse to consider them otherwise  Edit: 20:22 THANK YOU
Scott The Woz:2Much2D.
16:23 Not the first time Scott lost his mind
Can you tell that Scott might not be hetero?
All this was just too much for 2 dimensions to handle
This quality, this often is the youth. Avgn used to pump them out weekly too. Enjoy Scott. Enjoy him. They're putting an insane amount of work into this entertainment. Never take it for granted.
“Hey y’all Scott here.” Me to myself “Hey Scott, all here.”
I'm glad Scott is finally getting around to giving Kirby some attention
Look at me im not first
I’ve always thought that whether 2D or 3D, its about how much fun you can have with the game.
what is the game at 10:17?? i wanna play it it looks so cool
Scott seems like he would be fun at family reunions
Like in movies, 3D graphics are overrated. There are games that work in a 3D environment and we now have graphics that are arguably too good, but games will always look better with style and design. N64 was still very early so 2D was an easy way to make the design easier, but I still love proper 2D sprites in 2D space and maybe use more cutting edge techniques to make it feel like there's depth.
I do a happy dance every time i see a new video notification
Scott uploaded as I just finished work. He'll yeah
Scott: it was a great game at the time, with great cutscenes, artwork, animation" *wario twerks*
NOITICE ME SENPAI UWU KUN
shout out to scott for playing chibi robo zip-lash for footage
Normally I hate when there’s random uploads  *Scott’s the exception*
i love 2d games
"great animation!" *shows wario ass*  me: yeah sounds about right.
12:12 yo whats da game
oh boy, just uploaded
$4.99'!!!📉📉
We get it Scott, you're going to make a 3D Dot Game Heroes Special.
Oh hi there Scott.
Scott the woz
Im happy when he shows Oddworld
it's 2 am in italy... i don't care
Controller Rumble is 4D
Love it!
Some people still think 2d games aren't as valuable as 3d. Just look at all the idiots crying about Metroid Dread costing $60. Bunch of morons
Thats Clints Stevens, thats quality
N+ was one of my favorites on the Xbox 360 game store
0:45 I live for scream... '_'
Jschlatt was here
0:05 me when I'm pair up with someone irresponsible in group work at college
9:07 Repo! The Genetic Opera (2008) Starring Scott Wozniak
Scott is pretty much held hostage by someone
Take a shot every time Scott says "D"
scocot
Guys, he acknowledged Peggle.
5:26 I always feel like that way when people say “Mario Kart DS was the Mario Kart game after Double Dash” when the Arcade games exist
The king does this make his return
Fall and rise wired
Take a shot every time Scott says “2D is for the handheld”
"Well, you know what they say...  ...let's play Gex"
No class and scott upload what a great day
beard?!?!?!
Scotts upload schedule replicates my life and Im all for it
Hey scott! Y’all here, thanks for another 10/10 banger
Is this moon shine or porn is my favourite gag ever so clever well done scott
Scott, you don't need a 21-minute video to tell us why 2D games are worse since Persona 4 came out.
.
Scott could talk about a toilet and itll still somehow be entertaining
I've always hated 3D games and I always will.   1. All you see is your character's ass and weird walk/run cycle 2. Your character's center axis isn't always where you'd think, making simple jumps a painstaking process of lining up slowly or readjusting in mid-air 3. Without being able to see behind your character, you're at the mercy of a sloppy radar to tell you when enemies are close  I could go on forever, but these fatal flaws are in EVERY 3D game from crappy Mario 64 (don't try to convince me it doesn't suck) to the crap on consoles and PC today
3D games were harder longer and are meant to be fully viewed models and different looking graphics. 2D games were faster easier don’t require full models and normally have graphics that arnt that realistic
This video made my day!
Scott is gonna wait till 2030 to release his video on the L Button
656th
i was a primarely handheld gamer during my childhood and i follow many series that never had major continuous home console releases so i find the attitude about handheld games equally, if not more, baffling than scott here
Scott is awesome.
Hey Scott, Yall here
if you're talking about 3d, where's quake
Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand
Now all Nintendo games are handheld games.
I like seeing more of out of frame people in his videos because they add to the joke and make it more literal which ergo makes the joke more visually entertaining!
nice
Holy shit it’s scock
scott suddenly uploads?!     he's a legend fr
Cool fact Quake and Mario 64 came out 1 day apart from each-other. 3D gaming had a pretty damn good start
I love how it’s barely in the first seconds of the video and the first thing that happens is Scott saying “go f**k yourself”
4:43, yeah don’t know if I can trust someone who put the ps2 below the gamecube and backwards
NSMBDS: That sold well let's do it again! NSMBWII: This sold slightly less let's do it again! NSMB2: This isn't selling well but let's do it again! NSMBWIIU: We're out of ideas guys let's just do the same thing again! NSMBD: Shit run for it!
How much I would give for Scott to review a Kirby game.
Just when I was looking for something to watch. Thanks Scott, all here.
Random Scott Uploads is like Christmas every week
Still waiting for terraria. If he even says it will be happy
I just woke up
Awesome 240
F I N A L L Y ! ! ! Someone acknowledged Frogger 3D.
He should’ve made a joke about the love of dimensions being called “Dementia”. I don’t think he’s done that before, I’d remember if he did.
I was there when mario 64 came out. 7th or 8th grade I believe. It blew everyone away at my school. From that point if a game wasn't 3d or as we knew it then "64" it was not to be played
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
“The bank is repossessing my body!” I need to make a list of Scott’s best quotes.
hey scott
Hey Scott, y'all here!
At 2:54 did Scott say "But in came Mario 64" or "Baring came Mario 64?" I think he was trying to mimic the star sound effect or somthing.
First here
yay new upload
Scott doesn't know what schedules are, he just uploads
Ahhhh yes “go f*** yourself” best motivation ever needed
Holy shit, I'm early, I should say something funny-     The Virtual Boy.
Scott not uploading only on Sundays makes me believe that the fabric of the fabric of universe is falling apart.
I love 5d so much
Today is a good day when Scott uploads
Persona 4 golden
What happened to Sunday nights. I like the randomness, but I love a good schedule. Still love you Scott. 💙
We need to start a GoFundMe so Scott can buy is body back from the bank
The only real 2D game was phineas and ferb across the secind dimension the video game
theres a trend of looking at something thats a product of hardware limitations, go "well its a product of limitation so its bad", try to replace it, and then realise that "oh it can be both that and GOOD"  Turn based combat, sprites, pixelart, Certain types of videogame music  Theres a reason " limitations breed creativity" is a saying
I love 2D games

Scott has Become an Unpredictable Force we Must not Trifle with.
Wow now your just in video overload mode not even a week apart or at 1am
I came so fast, there were no views
…?
Waz
Without 2d is without 3d..
2d still coll
m
We'll just wait for the next rise of 2d gaming again
Remember when Nintendo released one 2D platformer game for the GameCube and then had a complete change of heart and released at least half a dozen 2D platformers for Wii and then continued to do it for Wii U and Switch? Those were certainly times. By the way, that one 2D platformer Nintendo made for GameCube was Donkey Kong Jungle Beat if anyone didn’t know... I guess a big monkey playing bongos was the best Nintendo could do for the time.
Okay now do a video on kid Icarus uprising
"dimensions oh my favorite!"  Same scott,
I honestly feel like if I wrote: "The Man. The Myth. The Legend." in any comments section of a Scott video, it would fit
hey daddy
Megaman Battle Network Transmission would like to argue with your chart at 5:00 . It's not a good argument, but it would like to argue.
The only 2d games i can play today is fighting games
Hey, Scott, all here!
SCOTT!!!!! THE!!!! WOZ!!!!
Wake up babe, new scott's video episode!
I was watching Scott's video about the GBA when this notification comes out. What a great coincidence!
I’m a simple man, I get Scott the wiz notification, I click it
Hi I'm from 21 minutes into the future. Great episode. Loved the ending. Also watch out for blueberry pi-
“What is this? Moonshine or Porn?”— Scott The Woz
Do you think I'm a nerd if I say  I am a YouTube fanboy I am a grown adult man who is a Christian religion believer I am white and a good person
6 minutes in a 20 minute video and theres already 7 dislikes?
Ah yes, the highest quality content YouTuber with no shift
Maybe?
Scott if you had to show a ratchet and clank game for the ps2 genre WHY not a normal ps2 ratchet why the god awful psp games I'm anguished
So we had the 3D video and the 2D video.  Can’t wait for line: the game
Scott The Woz is My Favorite Disney Princess
I'm enjoying the random uploads. Like a lil random Christmas present.  God bless us everyone.

Scott Tuesday
4:16 I JUST GOT THE NOTIFICATION FOR YOUR TWEET IM SORRY
“Maybe someday we'll get the true fourth dimension in gaming” → Miegakure.
Why did he have to do it while I was studying
your video's a really good
Can’t wait till some dumba** creates a 3rd person game in 2d
New tom holland video dropped
“Not in some kind of… stage play!” *shows Super Mario bros 3* I see what ya did there Scott
Hey, five minutes! That's a new record for me.
Scott it’s a Tuesday
3D Games: *Exist*  Kirby Games: What the hell is this?
I can’t look at Scott the same way again since he enjoys playing an RPG
2d is the best 2d
"Do you want Sonic in 2D or 3D?" Sega: Best I can do is a 2D section that glitches into 3D where you die immediately.
Scot th wo
"I should know, I wasn't there." Why the fuck not, Scatt the Waz, if that isn't your real name!?
Was just thinking about when Scott was gonna post another video and now here I am…..
A wild scott video has appeared !!!
Nintendo ds and the wii have the best 2d games.
Yeah yeah yeah hey all scot here is good but hey y'all scott here is beter
Ahh yes, 2D gaming truly hit its peak at Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash.
Never the day I see Scott talking about the rise and fall of games
Scott Is Talking About 2D While Hes 3D
YES Astro Bot Rescue Mission Footage! That game is AMAZING!
Egg
Wott is my favorite Scoz
I'm gonna use that Lincoln line from now on, thanks Scott!
Can't wait for the vague semi series where Scott breaks down every dimension of gaming and it's definitive titles. He is both currently working on and has already finished the 5th one.
Scott the Woz on a Tuesday night?! Tonight is a great night 😊
"Hey you know what they say...."
That was quick
I was expecting him to be pixelated in 2d for some reason
That stain on your hoodie is buggin me Scott
It was just uploaded to the point where scott's channel hasnt displayed it yet
Eyyyyy nice a new scott vid
2d gaming became cool, then became tiresome. 3d became cool, then became tiresome, then 2d gaming became cool again. Rinse and repeat. We will continue this cycle till we are sucked into a digital realm via Neural connectors that hijack our spinal cord signals and inputs its own signals to make us see things. I for one welcome our eventual matrix future lifestyle.
Scatt the waz is great
Hey ya,ll Kaiser here
It should have been the rise, the fall, and then the rise of 2D gaming.
Lincoln is dead? I DIDN’T EVEN KNOW HE WAS SICK.
Thank you Scott for tackling the topic of dimintia again.
help they found my address
1:54 this caught me off guard I was listening to it with earbuds i regretted that
“The only one who could care would be Lincoln” “HES DEAD!”
Ride to hell broke scotts upload schedule thats hilarious
0:05 This could be a meme template
I swear scott can talk about anything and I will eat it up
people always forget that quake came out before sm64
Scott’s background, despite being the least touched upon thing in his videos, has somehow became the most recognizable thing besides his face.
i like how scott actually has funny well thought out jokes and gags unlike some youtubers
F L A T
scott might be on his insane period currently, stating on how he had to go through his divorce and the mirror talk. also why dont we have the 4th dimension?
Oh boy Scott the Woz
What
Welp 2d games might have fallen and soon 3d games will fall too and we'll remember the memories we had with playing them but we'll always remember that scott owns sonic jam
Hell yeah Scott made a new video! :D
3 minutes and I find this. Nice.
Still waiting on Smellovision.
Doom and Wolfenstein 3d were 2.5 D
Thanks for the advice, I now know what to say at Thanksgiving dinner
7th
Algorithm boosting comment

scott
I want a game based on early ps1/saturn games that emulate their graphics.
Lol
I’m glad Scott quickly recovered from Ride To Hell, was half expecting him to have a villain arc or something
scott talking about random shit cured my depression
I’m here before 1k views
oh boy, i sure do love dimensions!
Epic
4301 viewer and 405 comment earliest ive ever been
chibi robo zip lash was the real fall of 2D games 😭
2D ain’t going away like embarrassing birthmarks on your forehead
Metroid Dread gang rise up!
scott lets go
NEW SCATT GANG WHERE YALLS AT
Every Scott the woz video is instantly the highlight of my week
2D games fell as much as a toddler tripping on a rock and rose as much as a rocket.
i got here more early to this video than my sister's wedding.
Maybe the family reunion were the friends we made along the way.
How am i super early to a scott the woz vid and I'm the 380th comment
Please Scott the Woz please talk about the epic Mickey series 😀😀
This kind of content is just what I need to treat my dimension fever
2D Games still have more dimensions that Joss Whedon’s Justice League.
Ahhh yes a new Scott vid great
hey scott all hrere
"Well, Scott, how are ya?" "You know what they say, go f**k yourself"
Scott uploading brings me joy
They really are
I’m glad I’m so early, now I won’t get spoiled about this glorious Scott episode
Babe wake up new Scott The Woz video
Scott is somehow still the funniest man on youtube even after years of weekly content.  He is an absolute legend.
I love any Scott the Woz video
Now uploading every random day!
1:10  Square enix fans can't get enough
GET UP BOYS  NEW SCOTT
^
Reject modernity. Embrace NO-D.

Let's go! Dimentia the Sequel!
Can we just appreciate how Scott makes quality videos weekly that are 20 minutes and better than 99 percent of things in this platform
1:12 rachet and clank size matter pog

Hey all, early gang here
Yay!
Ayo
Wake up babe, Scott the Woz uploaded a new video.
Thats Awesome
I want a 5D game :(
I haven’t been this early since never.
fastest click in the west yeehaw
Scott is the type of person to get 1 hr of mileage out of the history of a circle
I thought Frogger 3D was a Cheeze Itz
WAKE UP HONEY NEW SCOTT THE WOZ
poo
2 minute ago 😳

Last time i was this early, Scott hated breath of the wild
Scott always makes me laugh he’s so funny😁😁

"Scott uploading is like Christmas morning, It's the best!"  Me? - 09-07-21
Dimensions are my favorite too.
top 1000
Ok but we all know that the second “rise” is when Nintendo decided to only put out 2d games during the WiiU era
I would watch this, but this is the guy who owns Sonic Jam
Only 1 D for me, thanks. Polyamory ain’t really my thing
2d or not 2d
i'm 47 seconds in and i already love this episode
I’m early…. Who cares
RED ALERT THE FLING SMASH MAN HAS RISEN
Scott El Woz
Ayy scott uploaded
For once I’m actually here within the first 30 minutes of posting and part of the first hundred views.
Hey all
(its about fucking time you uploaded) YES SCOTT UPLOADED :D
Woah, an early video
Scott when is the Persona 4 golden video coming
Hell yeah I live in z axees
Not first
1:10 this will become a meme in a matter of minutes.  11:01 And this too.
Before watching, I hope he somehow mentions Mark Of The ninja (if he's not just talking about 2D gaming in a traditional sense), they way they implemented stealth into 2d is masterful, I hope it gets it's own video tbh
Hey Y'all, [NOT] Scott here!
Hd
Scott is the only person I listen to for life advice
I was just watching watching Scott the woz and this popped up
Sorry scott you're scraping the bottom of the barrel
Last
I almost wonder if 2D games will ever just become this really niche thing in the future that barely any big companies do anymore like what 2D animation has become in most parts of the world! Well, I hope not, but, I guess time will tell.
5d gaming. You piss in game and you piss irl.
early!!!!!!!!
Time for those Scott clip channels to do their magic again.
Scott was my first born.
I unironically discuss gaming with people I barely know at family reunions
Classic Scott.
Internet Ascott
Oh anew video.
8d the future.
The moment I see Scott, I have a smile on my face. See? 😃
Today is a good day, scatt uploads, life is good.
I am 4d
I still like 2d Mario more than 3d, ik that the new super Mario bros games are repeatitive, but I enjoy them alot, maybe that's just me, but I doubt it, people buy the 2d ones
reloading every few seconds and there's a few more comments
Holy fuck Scott the Woz
Dammit I'm tryna catch up on Scott videos and he drops this lol.
scott you’re still in trouble
Oh boy oh boy oh boy
not the l button episode
3 cheers for "hey all,Scott here!"
2D gaming is epic, some of my favorite games are in 2D
Nah, I play in 1d.
Is the upload schedule strange, yes. Am I complaining, nope!
I used to think 3D meant 3 dogs
71 comments zero views, Scott is overpowered
not first :sad:

Hi hubby
2 dimensional
234th
“You know what they say… Go f*ck yourself” That is my favorite quote of this
Time to contribute to nothing to society by watching more scott the woz!
Whoa Scott also tells himself to go F himself in the morning... Thought it was just me.
Playing Super Metroid right now that’s all I got to say
If Scott were to be a best man at a wedding, he’d start with a speech, but by the time his bit is over, it’s been a 40 minute rant about the e-reader.
Aw yeah
Hey Ya'll Scott here  Never gets old
I love the 2.5th dimension
Hey all
Yooo Scott The Woz?! Is that the guy who talks about the Wii U, Luigi, and Gex?
Hey all I'm here
This is a certified hood classic
