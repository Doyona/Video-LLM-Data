watching this again to remember him. was so sad throughout it but the bit that proper set me off was when mama grimes said "I love you and thank you". papa grimes was a legend x
Thank you so much for sharing your story, even now years on from this happening. I met you today at Togetherfest and your dad's story is so similar to my dad's. It even progressed in the same way....  Bringing awareness to the grieving process is so important and I was feeling so isolated like no one understood the trauma of dad's diagnosis and everything that comes with it.   It's still so raw for me but it's a conversation I really needed to hear, but to see your progress brings me great hope.  Love to your family and let's pray for a world free of mnd
I'm so sorry you had to go through this, but I'm so thankful you made this video. I've recently gone through this myself and it's now been 3 weeks without my Dad. Your video has helped me so much and made me feel not so alone. So thank you.
Sending big loves ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ ❤❤❤
I came across you on Tik tok and saw your video of what’s happened since you lost your dad. I’m so sorry for this heavy loss, I lost my mum at a young age and still miss her to this day. Know that your dad is so proud of you and your family and you are all so loved ❤️
This is heartbreaking. I hope you are managing to find some peace and enjoy the happy memories of your beautiful father/husband who looked like great great fun.
This was beautiful I don't no the love of a dad or will every feel the pain of loss of a dad so am sorry for your pain and heartache. I lost my mam 3 years ago I slowly watched her dying over the years it is truly awful and unfair when it's a disease that decides your parents fate sending my love to yous and thank you for sharing your dad's story yous all take care 💖💖💖
I cried my way through this video. I can’t imagine what your family must have went through, but your strength has truly inspired me. This is the most heartbreaking story, but it’s beautiful to see the light you guys continue to radiate. What an amazing family. Don’t ever stop shining ❤️
Rest in peace papa Grimms..he was a funny guy.. watching at 3am .after 6months.it was nice to see you gals again..I understand  what you have been going through..Big hugs from Germany
Heartbreaking to hear this, followed you on and off and I can tell you are a product of a beautiful strong family. RIP papa G ❤️
I was 34 when I said goodbye to my Dad. My brother was 30. It was such a difficult time ! Love ❤️ to you.
Made me cry & I didn’t even know him. Rest In Peace ❤️
This was a very moving and an amazing tribute to your dad and he would be so proud of you both standing up and telling his story after what he went through and what you all went through with him. You never gave up hope right until the end that a cure could be found for his illness, takes real strength and determination and that will help you going forward and to help you on your recovery after his passing.  A cure will be found one day for MND and there will come a time when no one will have to go through what you all went through ever again. I wish you all the very best of luck for the future, keep moving forward I know  from watching your other videos that is what your dad would have wanted you to do and he is guiding you every step of the way x
God Bless you both! He's with you always
I’m so sorry for your loss. I’ve been following you for awhile and knew you lost Papa G but did not know the details. I understood you needed your privacy. I lost my grandfather to ALS. It’s an awful disease and I’m sorry your family had to go through it. 💔
I was catching up on you tube today and my condolences are late. Love watching you and your beautiful family and very sad to see this video just today. Sending love and prayers to your whole family.  Many of us here have taken care of a family member with a terminal illness - it is heartbreaking yet the most loving wonderful thing one can do while giving comfort and peace  to our loved ones. God bless you all for being so real and such good loving people xoxo
I know exactly what you are going thru. My dad passed away on my mom's birthday. It's been 15 year's this past September. We also took care of him my siblings and I and our spouses. Such a difficult time it was for us all. God bless you all.
Thank you for this and for sharing this, this is my first video of yours I’m watching, my dad just died a couple of days ago it’s very comforting to hear your talk about your pain, I don’t feel so alone
Sending you so much love and strength❤️ you are beyond strong for recording this video to help others that takes so much strength and courage
I löst my Dad on 17th May 2021. He passed away in our arms. A Lot of light and love for ypu
Moje kondolencje [*]  oglądałam i płakałam razem z wami 😔  twój tata napewno jest bardzo dumny z ciebie !!
I lost my Dad at 18 and I promise it will get easier but not for a long time.Eventually your memories are just happy ones full of love .Stay strong and just keep going x
“HOPE,” is never foolish!
Wa beautiful and humble girls God bless yous xx
God this is just so sad 😭 I'm so sorry for your loss 😔 God bless you all xxxxx
My granny died of MND as well :( it’s awful sending my love
I am so so sorry for your loss ❤️  but what a lucky man to have been surrounded by 3 real life angels… he would of left this world with so much love and pride in his heart and that is beautiful! RIP Papa Grimes x
You were and continue to be his Angels! Sending so much love and care to you all x
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Much love to you and your family. I know it’s hard and I’m not going to lie but it will get harder. I lost my koro (grandad) in 2019 and it was two years this year in March. I am his oldest granddaughter and it hurts to know that he isn’t going to be here for when I have my first child, my wedding.
My heart goes out to you and your family. I love your mamma Grimes and your whole family. I lost my mom July 2020 to cancer and I am still struggling and probably always will. I'm just happy her physical pain is over. May God bless us all.🙏❤
One day at a time. You never stop missing your loved ones but it’s just the beginning. Never apologise for your grief embrace it when ever you need, sharing his love and stories is beautiful thank you for sharing
You're both so strong. Sending love to your family❤🥰
It took me a while to get around to watching this video. My heart really does go out to all of you. I’ve been fortunate enough not to loose a parent, but I’ve seen my best friend suffer through it this past year. I wish you all the best, and I hope you find the little light in the dark ⭐️
I am so so sorry for your loss Misha!! This video breaks my heart, I lost my godfather last year and he was my best friend. I can’t imagine what it’s like to loose a parent 😥
Sorry for your loss❤️
Wait it was my birthday 3 August (2004) Stay strong Mish and your mum ❤️
My dad had MND and passed away within two years of diagnosis. Seeing him deteriorate was the worse thing I ever had to witness. My thoughts are with you <3
You are all very brave and open , I lost my father through illness and it is gut wrenching
Never watched one of your videos but this came on my homepage and honestly broke my heart, your all so so brave I’m a nurse in A&E and having to tell people news like this is never easy and I always think about people going through this pain 💗 your all so strong, he looked like such an amazing dad 🥰 he will be so proud of you all xxx
So sorry to hear this 💔💔
So so sorry for your loss!! Papa grimes was so lucky to have such a lovely family to care for him.lots of love sent to your family and hope that time heels.🌹🌹🌹
You can only dream to be loved like papa grimes and find the type of between papa grimes and mumma grimes!  You gals are so strong, papa grimes will be so proud! Gosh I am so sorry for your loss. No one can prepare you for the loss of a parent, and I can’t even imagine!  This is such an inspirational and educational video, spreading much needed awareness!
Misha, I cannot gather any words together to make you feel any better. I used to watch you since I was young and I remember daddy Grimes very well!! He was always a ray of sunshine! I've lost my dad when I was 14 so I can empathise with how you're feeling. Just remember that he will always watch over you and your family! Lots of love.💕💕💕
I'm a carer and I found my absolute best friend and soul mate whilst looking after her, she had mnd it's they most heartbreaking thing I've ever seen someone go through. My heart bleeds for you! I was with her from the beginning to the end. It was an honour. Xx
Misha I’m soo sorry for your loss I don’t know how you seem so strong about it I can’t imagine being in your situation papa grimes seemed to be and amazing ,strong and loving father and husband . Again I’m so sorry I’m sending all of my love to you and your family . RIP Papa grimes 🙏❤️
Sending love to you and your family, absolutely devastated for you 😢 stay strong beautiful ❤️
Sweet Alfie ❤️
You are not naive ! You had Hope! Without Hope we have nothing ❤️
I can’t even begin to imagine what you are going through.  It’s absolutely heartbreaking 💔  No one has the right to judge any person.  No one knows anyone’s circumstances and you didn’t deserve that with what you were going through.  Papa Grimes had the best sense of humour! You have so many beautiful memories.  It’s going to be tough, never stop talking to each other.  Keep laughing and crying together .  Sending lots of ❤️
I can't watch, but sending lots of love. My dad has stage iv cancer which is incurable, don't know how long we have with him, could be weeks, months, or year+ if lucky. They originally said days/weeks, but his current treatment has kept him here 3 months so far. Hope treatment keeps working, and hope he can have options of other treatment to keep alive. Lots of love to you and your family.
I’m SO sorry for your loss!! I somehow just came across your beautiful video and I cried through the whole thing! I just lost my dad September 8th from a long battle starting with Covid 13months ago. Me being his only caregiver was extremely hard and I know exactly how seeing your dad decline, mine was a bodybuilder before all this and then I saw his body deteriorate as well and I think that was the hardest for me aswell❤️ the the last day he was here Was the hardest aswell! I have the same exact thoughts of him not being here for the future like you’ve said! It’s ok to struggle still and I’m SO unbelievable grateful that I came across your video!!! Stay strong loves💗
I am in a wheelchair due to m s . I am the same always fighting the cruel condition and will never stop fighting it . Your dad was a brave strong man . Lots of love to u and family  x
My brother was murdered in June, watching your video has been so nice, you girls are beautiful people inside and out.  One day at a time we will all heal🌻🌻🌻
Those we love don’t go away they walk beside us every day..RIP
Stumbled across this video and would just like to give my biggest condolences. You are clearly a beautiful, wonderful family, incredibly close-knit and strong, and you both presented yourselves so well.   Rest in peace Papa G. ❤
You’re all truly inspirational, the strength you girls have showed throughout it all is incredible. My heart breaks for you all. You’re making him so so proud!! You’ve got my whole heart right now❤️❤️
I've stumbled across this video, my step dad has just passed. Got told last September he had 14 months to live and he passed in May. Knowing I'm not alone in this grief journey is a small comfort and I'm sending love to you and you family and anyone else going through the same journey 😥
You both are so strong and amazing 👏.  Well done for putting this video out there and bring more awareness to ALS. X
I’ve just come across your channel from this video, firstly I’m so sorry for your loss and who heartedly know how you feel I unfortunately lost my beautiful mum last year to MND she was also 59 when she passed and don’t wish that journey on anyone, would love to connect and help support you guys emotionally if you want to talk. Lots of love xxx
So sorry for your loss. The 💙
Awww he seems a lovely Man ♥️
Heartbreaking. I've cried so much with you. Memories forever.  Even back to the days I lost my Mum and Dad.  I wish you all comfort and easing of the pain and grief you are feeling now.  Take care of yourselves.  XXX
😘🙏🏻❤💜 take care and take care your family too
So sorry for your loss. My thoughts and prayers are with you. God bless you xxx
Sending so much love 🧡
God Bless you all, you have done so well to make this vid. X
This is heartbreaking Misha. You have made him so so proud and he loves you so much <3
Sending so much love to you and all your beautiful family right now. You both spoke on this so well, I know how beaming proud Papa Grimes must be <3
I lost my brother around this time last year, this resonated with me so much. What an emotional roller coaster. Your strength is inspiring 🤍🕊
Just watched this video.  You are both beautiful & strong ladies.  It brought back memories of mam who passed on 26 years since July.  She too probably had motor neurons disease as she suffered all the symotoms your dad experienced.  She was just a month off her 74th birthday when she passed on in July 95.  I was 29 at the time but am now 55 just 4 years younger than your dad Papa J.  Well done to you both for speaking out.  I do hope & pray they will get a cure for Motor Neurons disease or ALS soon.  I was living in London at the time during my mam's illness, my mam ended up in Nursing Home in Ireland from Nov 94 to July 95 until she passed.  I come from a large Irish family so she had a lot support right up to the end. Fair play to you for looking after your dad at home, such a distressing disease to see a loved one go through.  Keep smiling ladies, cry when ye need to and as you said retail therapy helps out alot too to help with the grief. xx
my mum was diagnosed with mnd in 2014 and is luckily still with us, thank you for making this video&raising awareness, i am so sorry for your loss xxx
He seemed like such a cool dad ❤
Respect for you guys. You do what you need to get through this. Don't let anyone tell you during these (Covid) times that you should follow all these rules without thinking and feeling for yourself what is right. You did everything you could and you did it so well! Just keep going like that!
Ahh thank you for sharing! Im so glad to hear that he had his family with him. I just found out this week that my grandmother's brother died from motor neurone disease. He didn't tell anyone about his condition and he was alone till the end . If I had known I would have brought a plane ticket...I feel like my heart has been broken all over again
❤️❤️
Just saw this video in my newsfeed and god bless you two honestly 🤍 I can not imagine what you guys went through and especially your mum hats off to her, loosing the love of your life you shared kids and a beautiful life with you’re the definition of a strong woman 🤍
So sorry for your loss can not imagine what your going through but this touched me I cried throughout all this video💔
I am so sorry for your loss😢💔🙏🕊. May your Dad rest in paradise forever.🌄
So sorry for your loss, my gran got MND back in June and only lasted two months  it was horrible how fast the disease took her life, thank you for sharing your story it was touching and very similar to my grans story  hope yous are all doing well 💖

I am so happy for you that you were able to be there with your father to the end. How special those last days and hours are. I never knew my father, so seeing your emotions about your father are touching to my heart. How beautiful it is that you loved him so much. Thank you for sharing with all of us.
So sad 😞...keep smiling 🥰
Sending so much love to you three beautiful women ❤️
Where are Misha?We miss you

Sending the whole family the most amount of love🧡
I lost my dad 5 months ago after a finding out he had incurable brain tumours in January of this year. those last moments spent with him were the most difficult of my life. But hearing your story and the similarities between yours and mine shows me that I am not alone in the way that I feel. Sometimes it still doesn’t feel real but he gives me signs that he is still here. Thank you for sharing your strength ❤️
Hi I’m new and I am impressed with your video 👍👍👍
So sorry for your loss but with you big smiles you can do it just smile as my dad used to tell me
Thank you so much for sharing such a personal story. It's been so comforting watching this having been through something relatable. You ladies are amazing!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Cried with you both the whole way through this. You are both so so strong for making this video. Thank you for this, my dad passed away last year after a short but strong battle with cancer. He was diagnosed in Jan and passed away in may at the age of 47, his birthday was in March, he was so young.. I can relate to a lot of this, such as the stages of seeing someone you love so much deteriorate in front of your eyes so quickly💔 you have both gave me so much comfort knowing somebody understands, I can’t say it will get any easier but remembering all the good times makes each day that little bit better. You’ve got this misha, sending you all my love <3
I lost my husband to MND 20 years ago he was 47.  My heart goes out to you. I thought there would be a cure by now.. My husband was so selfless and never moaned. He was an  incredible man. It sound like your father was too. Take care. Xxx
Sending so much love 💕 💗 you have so much courage and a kind heart. Your mommy as well. Your dad is lucky to have such a loving family and you for having him as a husband & dad.
love you,,from spain,bssss
Sending hugs and kisses to you guys, this was so emotional to watch. Seeing the pain through others and what they have been through has really touched me and not just me others as well xx
Very moved by this. Well done for being so eloquent throughout. A job well done lovely, your  dad would be proud
I’ve waited to watch this because I knew it would be so upsetting and sad. I literally have so much love and admiration for the grimes family! I’m gonna keep my phone on repeat and watch the adds! Love you girls. Sending all my love. 💜
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Jesus. You guys are so strong and brave. 🥰 I send all my love to you all.
I lost my uncle to cancer last year i sending my condolences and love xx
I'm so sorry for your loss❤
So strong! It’s amazing seeing the strength and love between you and your mum, it’s exactly like mine and my mums relationship and we lost my amazing beautiful dad to cancer in June this year. Sending you both and all your family, all the love and strength in the world, take care ❤️❤️
sending you all the love💖 My momma past away from MND too, over 8 years ago she was only 43, most devastating illness I have ever witnessed, my daughter was 4months old at the time my mother’s spirit was definitely passed to my baby girl💖 Wishing you all the love & healing ❤️‍🩹
Very sorry for you all. Lost my wife nearly 3 years ago . You two look like twins.
You never know what people are going through. Your beautiful smiles were hiding so much pain, a testament to your strength.  Take care of each other, and thank you for sharing a little piece of Pappa G with us, he looked like a very special man ❤️
You and your family are so strong misha! I personally know how hard it is to watch someone you love have MND. My grandpa has had it for the last 25 years which as you said is incredibly rare but we are so thankful he’s going on 80 next year and he’s the most incredible strong man ever who takes every day as it comes! Thank you for using your platform to raise awareness and funds it’s something I feel so passionate about it and I’m so hopeful a breakthrough will happen soon to avoid anyone else going through this I love you strong girl!!💞💞💞
I lost my Dad to covid last year he was 59 and fit and healthy just like you describe your Dad. Iv sobbed my heart out to this video, I totally relate to you and I also totally understand your heartbreak for your Mam. My heart breaks more for my Mam more than anything ever it’s just the most painful thing to watch. I also got to spend the last moment with my Dad and my family in the ICU and I also totally relate to the “allowing him to go” conversation. Thank you for this video, it’s really really touched my heart 🤍
Sending love ❤️ MND is so cruel, having seen it take my uncle after a 2 year fight. Hope there is a cure one day 🙏
I am so sorry for you I could never imagine how hard this is for you and your family I wish you all the best stay strong ❤️❤️
i cannot think of how you're all feeling at this time, sending my love to you all <3 when my friends dad passed she had all his clothes made into blankets and pillows x
I'm sorry for your loss. Sending your family love and strength at this difficult time. Xxx
You guys are amazing! So sorry for your loss. Sending love from Canada 🇨🇦 ❤️❤️
Thankyou for sharing your difficult journey. May God comfort you all. I know how hard it is to say good bye as my 2 sisters and I had to make the decision to let the Dr turn the air supply off to my father who was struggling to breath with lungs filled with fluid. We said goodbye as his spirit left his body and just in case he was looking down I looked to the ceiling and waved a tearful heartbroken farewell, bye for now Dad.
Sending lots of love xx
Thank you for this. We lost my beautiful  mother in law a month ago to this cruel disease . She was diagnosed on boxing day and it was a very quick decline
Life goes on , but you hold on to the precious memories you lived through in your life with your dad. I know the feeling i lost my dad when i was ten.
I’m so sorry for you loss. My mum died when I was 19 suddenly when she was 40. and it was so so so hard. It always will be but it’s the memories that will keep him alive in your heart.  You are al so strong. He would be proud of you all xxxxx
My heart broke for you all. I cried through this video. I’m so sorry for your loss❤️.  I lost my mum 5 years ago and there’s no pain like it. I’m sending my love to you all xx
Sending my love and prayers to you Grimes family.  Stay strong a s look forward  to continuing your Dads Legacy. 🌍
Awwww im sooooo sorry for yalls loss!!! I know that has to be so hard i couldn’t imagine losing my daddy. I love yallll soo much. Yall are in my prayers 😢😢
My dad passed on the 1st august, everyday is painful without him the last 18 months have been so hard with him being ill and us looking after him until he went into hospital 5 weeks before he passed my thoughts and prayers are with you
You're all so so strong! Papa Grimes will be the proudest man! So sorry for your loss xxxxxx
I hope you raise a lot from this video. You don’t need to justify yourself to people being horrible about you moving, people need to be kind and realise no one knows what’s going on behind close doors. Thinking of you and your family x
So so so heartbreaking xxx
Oh this is so dreadfully sad and unfair. I’m so sorry for your loss, your moms loss and your whole families as well. ❤️
Im soo sorry for your loss. Theres alot of things that you mentioned that I can relate to. My uncle passed away last month with lung cancer - he was the same age as your dad. I saw him the night before he passed and he was drowsy but alert. Spent time talking to him and within 2 mins of coming home the next day he passed away.  I understand what you mean about the NHS, they're really stretched on resource. You just feel so helpless when you see someone deteriorating in front of you. Sonya x
This is such a heartbreaking yet moving video ❤️ I experienced this first hand with my step Dad who passed away 6 years ago now from MnD. It’s such a horrible disease to see the person you love lose every sense of their own ability. There is so much pain there but always hold onto the positive memories and how proud he will be of all you. Sending lots of love 🥺❤️
Unreal 😢
Sending you strength and prays !!!!!💞
Was not your fault at All !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’m so sorry 😐 !!!!
I’m shocked
Beautiful family !!!!! I’ve followed for such a long time !! Then this !💞hope your girls r there xx
Holy shit 😭
Can’t believe this ! 💞
Please no way !!!!!!
So, sorry to hear of your loss🙏🏻
My nana got diagnosed in the July, and passed away in the October, and she was only 64 😭😢 sending you lots of love xx
I've been putting off watching this because I had a feeling it would be MND and I knew it would be a difficult watch. I wish I could wave a magic wand and make it all better for you both. What a beautiful pair of people. You do not deserve this pain and neither did your wonderful dad. I lost my mum to MND almost 2 years ago now and I cry all the time thinking about the pain of other families who are dealing with this. Sending you all of my love
so sorry for your loss i am breaking my heart for yous sending all of yous love xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
cried my eyes out watching this, love to your family💕
What a beautiful family ❤️ He would be so proud of you all. Sending you all so much love xxx
Thanks for sharing your heartbreaking story! I lost my Dad 6 years ago to MND after only 2 weeks of him being diagnosed. It’s so heartbreaking and you never get over it, but with time it gets easier💜
Firstly I’m so so sorry you’ve gone through this. My heart is honestly broken for you. Im weeks away from loosing my grandad.. the most important man of my life❤️thank you for sharing your experience you’ve given me the strength I needed xx
I’m so sorry for your loss. I understand your pain. I lost my father a month ago and it has been the hardest month of my life. I am sending all my love to you, and keeping you and your mom in my thoughts and prayers 💗
So sorry for your loss xx
Kasha, mamma grimes - you are such a beautiful, strong, wonderful lady ❤️ be proud of how you are managing through this. The love of your life will be so proud of you too! 🙏🏼 he will be watching, listening and brimming with pride at all of you 3 girls. 💛 god bless you all. 💙 beautiful family xx
An amazingly brave video to have done, Misha 💙 we're all with you and your family. Thank you for helping us raise awareness of motor neurone disease. We will always keep fighting this disease in the memory of people like your dad!
So so heartbreaking to watch, cried my eyes out the whole thing such a strong family I lost my dad 4 years ago and it will still never feel real sending love to you all🥺❤️❤️❤️
I totally understand the guilty feeling of family and friends not being able to see loved ones due to covid. Both my grandad and mum passed away in the same week in the height of covid and we had to make a choice of who could visit. Certain family members weren’t happy but we were in a tricky situation!
Read the title and wanna send you my love... ❤️👍... worst thing I could ever think of happening to any close family... take care all of you xxxx
I wondered if at some point you would be able to talk about your spiritual experiences after the passing of Papa Grimes, I hope that doesnt come across as insensitive in any way. I think you're all incredible and so strong xxxxx
Thank you for raising awareness of what families have to deal with regarding illness, disabilities, mental health etc. People really are not aware of the strength that is needed for a person to maintain their health and fitness and the huge responsibilities and impact it can have on families. I have cerebral palsy which has deteriorated as I have got older and I can't tell you how important it was to have such a strong supportive family like you all are. So sorry for your loss
Amazingly strong to do this 💪🙌
Exactly what I’m going through with my father currently, and my dad was an active cycler too. This illness is so horrible I don’t have words for it
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16  Sorry for your loss, may God comfort you both. Put your faith in Jesus and remember death isn’t the end. God loves you and sent His one and only Son to save us, believe in Jesus. He is our living hope.
Heartbreaking. Sending all the love in the whole world ❤️
So so sorry for you’re loss beautiful my heart aches for you all, thoughts are with you and you’re beautiful family 💜xxx
Oh 🥺I am so sorry 😢❤️
I sobbed at this, you've made me want to appriciate each and every day and never take anything for granted xx
My dad died of MND last year and I never felt so alone thinking that no one understood this awful disease, thank you for bringing awareness to this horrible horrible condition and I am so sorry to hear about your dad, may he rest in peace 🥺 ❤️
Literally crying too 😭 😢
❤️❤️ amazing family  So sorry for your loss girls xx
My Nan passed away in March 2020, and the heavily sedated period you spoke about almost mirrored my experience. Because of lockdown I’ve pushed all of it aside and not thought about the ordeal too much, but watching this has made me realise I need to, so I thank you for that. Lots of love to you all, in making this video you have encouraged me to open up and begin processing what happened. X
Sending love and healing to all you! Papa Grimes was such a special being and will be greatly missed. ❤
The pain will eventually get easier to deal with, you two have done amazing. ♥️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love you guys, can’t imagine going through this ❤️

So sorry for your loss 😢 I lost my sister in June to this cruel disease , she was only 53. So sad
My mum has been battling terminal breast cancer for 2 years at the age of 51, she is now in a hospice with not very long left to live and just like you… I still have hope because hope is what helps us to cope. Whilst our situations aren’t  exactly the same, I’m so glad you’ve shared your story in such detail. Videos like this give me that little bit of extra strength during such awful times like this. You are an amazing family 💕
So heartbreaking 🥺
This is absolutely heartbreaking. I'm literally sobbing. I am so sorry for your loss. Your explanation for leaving your home during COVID was NOT needed. You do not owe it to anyone! ♥ I will be praying for your family.
Hello girls. Just so you know you’re not alone. I lost my husband of 21 years of marriage last year. He’s 59  years old when he passed from skin cancer. I survived with a son he’s 19 in college, so I live by my own in a big house. It’s a day to day struggle since I don’t have family here, I’m from the Philippines, he’s from Germany. Hugs to all of you and try not to cry coz you make me cry.
Sorry for your loss. I lost my mom 5 months ago, it's still hard,but I know in time, it will get easier. The best thing I've found to do, is cry when you need to cry, and keep putting one foot in front of the other. You'll get through this, and so will I. Hugs to you all❤🙏
Misha, MamaG and Anya - you girls are so bloody strong. I’m in floods of tears hearing about your experience and seeing how hurt you are🥺. PapaG and your angel brother will be looking down on you all so so proud of you and how you’re coping with everything. Puts things into perspective and reminds me to count my blessings and hug my loved ones that bit closer. Thank you for sharing this heartbreaking experience with us, the stories of PapaG are so amazing he seemed like an amazing man❤️
So sorry for your loss❤️
So sorry for your loss! Sending you all the love and strength in the world! He would be so proud of you! ❤️❤️
I admire your reaching out and having the courage to share your experience so in depth. We lost our special daddy on Aug 7 in a similar situation with a 1+ year difficult fight.  It was so heart breaking and it hurts so much. This video was like therapy for me - watching and learning from your strength, and also it made me feel like I'm not alone. You are angels!
I lost my daddy to at 21 .I understand what you feeling and experience ..as you I had the same fears of getting married and have a baby ..I can tell you my daddy was there at my wedding and at my baby girls birth  😊and your daddy will be with you on those days you will know his next to you . Big hug sweet girls and mumxx
So sorry for your dad ,RIP

I was so shocked when I saw this video, I am so sorry to you both, I've watched you for about 2-3 years now, stay strong, I'm proud of you woman🥺💞my heart is broken for you.
I’m so sorry for your loss
Sending you and your family so much love and hugs, you are all so strong... i lost my dad 3 years ago to cancer it all happened very fast.. being told he had cancer to a year later loosing him.... i found it so hard and sadly i didn't get to spend his last few days with him as i live in Cornwall and he was in Essex. The day i got the phone call to say i had to get up there asap was the hardest day of my life knowing i had to make the 5+ hour car journey know that i might not make it.... i wish i could say it gets easier with time but thats a lie i think you just learn to live with the pain and i i feel you because a better person (grief changes you as a person) xxx
My condolences truly 🖤 here for you. Even though I am a stranger I have been watching for awhile.
Sending u so much love I’m a new subscriber xxx
You guys are so so strong! I am so sorry for your loss ❤️ don’t forget he’ll always watch over you ❤️
i miss my dad so much - fuck cancer
There's nothing like feeling helpless in saving the people you love from something you have no control over. Sending you guys all the love and healing. He was lucky to have you and you were lucky to have him...
Aw bless you Misha, this is heartbreaking! I'm so sorry to hear about your dad. It's devastating to hear about how you were personally targeted when people didn't know what was going on :'( sending hugs to you and the family. Stay strong. RIP Papa Grimes 💕💕
I am so sorry for the loss of such a wonderful man, sending you all so much love xx ❤
Hugest lump in my throat, I'm so sorry to be reading this ladies. Sending love to you all
I’m so sorry you had to go through this 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
Just wanna say you have such courage to even talk about your dad the way you have and my condolences go out to you and the family!! He would be so proud of you. Such beautiful and strong women ✨❤️
Thinking of you. I lost my dad young , so hard but I know you are 3 girls are  Strong and there for each other. He would be so proud of you all xx
My mum died off cancer I miss her so much every day I'll be praying for you
I know what it feels like stay strong
Beautiful girls I feel your pain. Stay strong. Thanks for doing this video it took so much strength 💔xx
Misha this video broke my heart this video is rare and pure ❤️ the strength and the courage you and mama grimes have is unbelievable 💕 sending all my love he will never be forgotten 💕
Sending you all so so much love! I can’t imagine what you’ve been through. He’ll be so proud of you!❤️
It is so unfair that the cruelest things in life really do happen to the kindest people. Your dad would be so proud of you all <3. Having to watch your loved ones suffer like that is utterly soul destroying, I lost my grandmother 2 weeks ago to brain cancer and she deteriorated in a similar way you described your dad did, it was one of the hardest things my family and I have ever gone through. To see you being so brave and being able to chat to thousands of people online just shows how much of a queen you are! It really has helped me watching this video to know that there are other people who have dealt and grieved in a similar way from the unimaginable experience of having to lose a loved one in such a horrible way. To know that they are no longer suffering  and are watching down on us is what aims to keep me going and put a smile on my face! A quote that I said to my nan was 'this is not a goodbye, its a see you soon' and that is so true and until we do meet again I know she will be my guardian angel watching over me, much like I'm sure your dad will be for you and your family ! You really are an inspiration Misha so keep slaying and F the haters !! You go girl Xxx
Sending love to all. Stay strong girls, he will be so proud of you.
I have only been able to bring myself to watch this now but Grimes ladies you are absolutely incredible and making papa Grimes SO proud! the strength this video took to film is so admirable x I am so so sorry you all had to go through this and I am sending all my love and support! you are spreading so much awareness which is such an amazing thing x sending all my love
I'm so sorry for your loss xx
I have experienced MND in my family and the work MND do to support is amazing. Sending strength 👍❤️
Proud of you girl. Keep strong ❤
So sorry for the loss of your lovely dad. Wishing you lots of strength and sending love xx
I am so sorry for your loss. I am sending you so much love and hugs. I am sure your dad/husband is so proud of you 💗💗
As a nurse, I think it is beautiful that you and your family declined carers and did everything yourselves. That kind of love and commitment is amazing and you should be so so proud of yourselves.  It does make me so sad that you had a negative experience in hospital, particularly in regards to basic care like assisting with food and drink. No one should be kept without nutrition for 3 days, and doctors/SALT should have urgently reviewed his swallowing to distinguish if he needed a feeding tube. If you haven’t fed back your experience to the hospital, please consider doing so. Yes, the nhs is underfunded, but basic care needs should ALWAYS be met.   Sending love to you and your family
Sending you love 🧡
i'm so sorry for your loss. you're both so strong.
haven't watched your channel in a while- so sorry to hear about your loss. I am so shocked by the news! I am sure you girls will look after each other :) will keep you in my prayers! :)<3 xxxx
So sorry 4 your loss death of a family member hard
I have no words...you are both so strong, What a beautiful tribute to Papa Grimes ❤️ Sending healing vibes to your family ❤️
I lost my auntie aka second mum within 2 years of her being diagnosed with cancer and I agree with you it doesn't feel like a long time in those 2 years... I couldn't imagine losing my dad and my heart breaks for you and your family but the best part is that u know he's up there watching over you. stay strong.
This is the first time I’ve watched, but all I want to say is I’m so sorry for the loss of your dad/husband…I’ve not stopped crying from start to finish. The bigger hugs to you all ♥️xx
We part for now only to meet again one day. I find that thought very consoling. Healing and blessings for you and family.
You both are so strong and the way you speak of your loved one is truly beautiful. I can feel the love you all shared through your story and words! I am so sorry for your loss~sending 💕
Sending my ultimate love Mishaa, to all of youuu! 🦋
Sending so much love to you all.  My hubby is still here but we have been given 6-12 months, and coming to terms with his deteriorating health and making arrangements is hard.  Telling people is just the hardest.  Also I am not prepared or adult enough to lose my best mate and have to make the important decisions on my own.  This video all resonates so much.  Thank you for sharing this personal time in your life.  It does help me and gives me comfort I will also find the strength you both show. Mamma Grimes is amazing and shows such grace and dignity.  She is right, we must talk about this and normalise grief.  It is a part of life too.  Take care my lovlies xx
You are all so incredible. What an amazing Dad you had. He is watching down on you all now. Xxx
You’re both so strong and amazing to be able to make this video, I was in absolute floods just watching🤍 sending so much love to you both and you’re so right, he’ll always be with you xxxxx
Sending so much love. 🤍 must of been so hard to talk about this x
❤️❤️❤️
This video is heartbreaking, the strength you all clearly have is admirable. May your whole family receive so much love ❤️💔 xx
You girls are amazing and I am so sorry for your loss. Thank you for being so brave and for doing this. Sending love and hugs 🤗❤️

RIP Papa Grimes💫, Rest in eternity of peace.  Never felt such a raw emotion from a video before. Went from crying my eyes out to being happy and content that your dad is no longer in pain. This video has impacted and raised so much awareness for ALS disease and just grief in general.  Thank you for sharing your experience as hard as it may have been😢 Such beautiful souls you guys are🤍I bet he couldn’t be prouder of you all!
💙💙💙
You are an amazing family - sending you all of my love and I just really admire your bravery in sharing your journey, your dad sounds like the most incredible man and you’re so right, he is with you and always will be X
This is such a beautiful tribute🥰😭😭😭 God bless you and your beautiful family❣️ Your in our thought and prayers. Sending you lots of love❣️💕
Ive only just saw this my loves. My heart is heavy . I feel a lump in my throat already.  I am so so so sorry from the bottom of my heart. You beautiful brave amazing women.  You will have each other.  What an amazing legacy he has left behind.  Its not the quantity of life its the quality and you know quality when you see it.  Im not religious but it was said at a funeral i went to once death is like blowing out the candle because morning has arrived. That always comforted me . I hope there is something after this life and you will meet again. Xxxxxxxx love and hugs xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

No words😔 RIP💔
I am so sorry! But you are all so incredibly strong❤️
I lost my dad 36 years ago and I miss him terribly every single day. I have his photo in my living room and talk to him all the time. I always wanted a husband like my dad and a father to my children just like my dad and thank God I found one! There's not a day that goes by that I don't talk about him. You and your mum will cope but will never get over the loss you feel. 😒❤
Your super super strong well done on this video
Docter from nhs24 was in when my mum passed he said she had couple weeks months and b4 he left went over to her  on sofa and she had passed peaceful thanks god 💖 xx

I've never cried so much in my life 😪
Sending love to you girls and to all your family ❤️❤️ Thank you for sharing with us xxx
The love your mum and dad have for eachother is just beautiful. My heart breaks for all of you. But i just want to hug your mum so hard. 🥺
I can’t even imagine the pain you are all experiencing. I’m sending so much love to all of you and your beautiful family. ❤️
Sending you all the love. Can't imagine how hard these past 2 years  must have been.
Some of the best ads I've ever watched! 😊 Love and support from New Zealand, wishing you guys all the best in your grief. I lost someone a few years ago and we had little heart necklaces made with a little bit of his ashes in each one, which some people find strange, but it is very comforting. You guys both did so well talking about everything, so proud.  You are all so strong! ☀️☀️☀️💛💛💛
☀️☀️☀️💛💛💛
I’m so sorry for your loss, my condolences❤️ My mother became absent mentally a few years ago so not able to talk, move and not conscious we don’t think. My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in May. We are thankful the tumours are very slow growing. It’s been very very tough, we aren’t a tight family unit , haven’t kept in tact through one family member loss so its an even bigger struggle for me to get through as a 23 year old mostly alone. You two inspire me so much and it feels as though you’ve normalised death. It needs to be spoken about more often, it’s not this abstract thing that everyone treats it as, it’s the inevitable. Thank you so much for this video, I will be thinking of you ❤️❤️❤️
Sending ❤️ to you and your family
❤️😭
Sending love and hugs to you all 💕💕💕💕take time for yourselves  ok xxx he would be so proud xxx
I’m so sorry for your loss. Sending love to your beautiful family 🤍🤍🤍🤍
So sorry for your loss, I lost my dad 8 months ago to MND and it’s the most cruel disease. Thank you for sharing your father’s story, I hope it can help to raise more awareness. Sending so much love to you and your family❤️

Sending you and your family lots of love 😔 god bless you all xxxxx
You could use his t-shirts and clothes and get them all sewn together to make a blanket 💕 sending love & happiness to you & all your family 🕊
So much love
He is with you - I promise! I recently when to spiritualist and was a complete sceptic and left a believer in an afterlife after family members came through and said things nobody could know! Take comfort he’s there xxx
Aw you are so lucky to have your wonderful mum to look after you ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ take care all of you xxxxx
I'm sending you all my love to you all you are all amazing and pappa g will be so proud of you all xxx🤗💙❤❤❤
It’s so nice that you have all those videos and memories of your dad to look back on. My dad didn’t like being in photos or videos and was more often behind the camera so I only have a handful of videos and photos of him, he passed away before mobile phones were a big thing. You and your mum are so strong and beautiful. So sorry for your loss, you never truly get over it but you definitely learn to live/cope with it ❤️
You are such lovely strong supportive women. I'm so sorry for you loss and thank you for being so open and honest 💜
So sorry for your loss Misha.Sending you lots of love ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️xxxxx
I just keep thinking of all that time you was going through this ! So so sad . And for you both to say “Naive” that is not the case at all who the hell can take it the fact he had 2 years to live . 😘 🤗
I'm so sorry for your loss, this is so totally heartbreaking 💔
Watching you guys tear up was heartbreaking. I hope you guys take time to heal and grieve as much as you need to, I can’t imagine how difficult this time is for you, stay strong and keep going girlies <3
I sobbed from the first second. I’m so sorry for your loss 💔
So so sorry for your loss. What strong ladies you are and your dad would be so proud of all 3 of you xx
I lost my dad when I was 13, he was only 46, he had a bleed on the brain and died suddenly. I am so sorry for your loss. Grieving a parent is so incredibly hard. you are both so strong! sending thoughts and prayers ❤️
Rest in peace Papa G  🙏
God Bless you guys, my dad passed away and of course every situation is different but I understand that feeling. I can't sit here and say that it will get better it's just something that I suppose over time will feel more comfortable to deal with. Just know that he will never be forgotten, I still speak too my dad tho might seem crazy but helps. Much love to you and your family 💙
Thank you for sharing and being so open. Sending lots of love to you and your family. Having lost my dad this year know your video has helped me. Just seeing your strength and all the love, and most importantly hope! Like you we had lots of special and beautiful moments towards the end. Keep the memories and your dad will always be with you, guiding you.
Sending you all so much love ❤️
I cried the whole way though!  You girls are doing amazing! I wish I had the time you did with papa G, I lost my dad at 4 and it kills me that I didn’t get to know him for longer.  I am getting married March 2023 and my dad not walking me down the isle breaks me every day.  I wish I could be as strong as you all.
I am so, so sorry for your loss! 🤎
I’m so very sorry Misha 💔 May you find peace and comfort in your memories ❤️🕊
This video is so heartbreaking 😭 I’m Sending you and your beautiful family so much love! I can’t even imagine how hard it must of been for you all! 😭 your all so strong!❤️❤️❤️❤️ I was crying during this 😭😭❤️❤️❤️
I’m very sorry for your loss 💗
Sat here and sobbed the whole video. Such a strong family. Cherish these last memories such a beautiful story. I lost my own daddy in February very quickly and unexpectedly due to sepsis, you and me are a similar age and your daddy and my daddy were a similar age. My parents live in Dubai while my brother and me live in the UK. Me and my brother were unable to see/speak to my dad while he was very ill and dying of sepsis due to COVID and Dubai being on the red list we were not able to go to Dubai. I didn’t get to say goodbye to my dad. 💕
How brave are you both sending hugs xx
There is somewhere you can make Pappa Grime's tshirts and clothes into teddy bears. I am not sure what it is called the company but might be a really nice idea for you all to cuddle. Sending lots of love xxxx
I lost my nanny and my daddy within 8 days of each other in January of this year. My dad's death was unexpected with him passing in his sleep. The feeling of loosing your hero is a pain that I would not wish on anyone, and my heart breaks that like me, you are now trying to navigate through this. 💔 Yours and your mother's strength is admirable and the power behind this video is noted. Through making this video, you will reach, inform and comfort thousands. 👏❤️ Your dad would be extremely proud of his girls, and he will shine through the both of you always. He may have been called Home, but his being and spirit shines through all of you.   Sending you all love, and may your dad rest in peace. 👼🏻 If you or anyone needs an outside person to rant to, a shoulder to cry on or just someone to talk to, I'm here.💕
So sorry for your loss 🕊💔
he is so proud of you all.xxxxxx
sharing times and memories Group  :D
I lost my beautiful Mother in May this year, she fought cancer like a ultimate warrior for 3 1/2 years and its the most heartbreaking thing I have ever had to deal with 💔. It is so incredibly hard to lose a parent but please keep your family and friends around you to keep you strong!. I know your world feels shattered right now and I definitely know the feeling but keep strong beautiful girl and sending huge hugs 💕
I've never watched a video of you before - but thank you for sharing your story! I'm sure papa Grimes is so incredibly proud of his girl squad ❤️you're so strong!
I'm 14 and I lost my dad a few weeks ago. I cant mentally watch this right now but if you need to talk I'm always here and know what your going through <3 the world is so cruel and remember you are so loved
Look at your beautiful smiles 😍 everyone is so proud of you. Sending you all the love possible 💕💕
My condolences to you and your family. God give you strength to get through this difficult time.   I have watched videos with your dad and he is so funny.  You gave him the quality time he needed throughout. Don't ever worry what people think, it's about your dad and his care that was needed. All my love to you all 💕
Thank-you for sharing awareness about this illness 😪 deepest condolences 🙏 stay strong lost my lovely mother she had palliative care etc it's soul destroying stay strong xx
You are both so strong❤️❤️
Literally have sobbed through this entire video. You both are incredible, Anya is too… but my God, papa grimes is absolutely so proud of his girls.
Such strong, beautiful women. I send nothing but my love and prayers.   Also, to all the people who were sending hate: I hope you feel horrible. Let this be a lesson to you to stop assuming when you have NO clue what someone is going through. Influencers only Show us a TINY portion of their lives.. you never know the horrible things that could be happening to them.  Also, STOP ACTING AS IF INFLUENCERS OWE YOU ANYTHING! They do not owe you explanations as To why they need a break, they don’t owe us footage, they don’t owe us content!
I don't think you were naive at all. My Mum passed away 2 years ago. She had cancer, and I held onto hope right until the end 😔❤
So so sorry for both of your loses
This was just heartbreaking 💔 I lost my dad to cancer a few yrs ago ,your Dad/husband will be so proud of you all 💕💕
sending you my love and prayers to you Misha, your beautiful family and your AMAZING father. It was/is such an honour to know of your father and to see and hear those challenging and perfect moments. It's inspiring to hear you see the beauty in every moment regardless of the pain❤️❤️❤️❤️ Beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder/s. 🙏🏻🙏🏻💖💖
You’re so strong, thank you for making a video that shows how difficult and raw loosing a parent can be 🤍 My dad passed when I was 17, now 23 it’s the same pain but I find comfort in the smallest things, look for the signs our daddy’s are around us, you should be so proud of yourself, sending you so much love x
Sending my love 💓
Misha my love, your dad sounds like he was an extraordinary man. You, your sister and your mam will always have beautiful memories with him. Sending so much love to your family. 💖
Big love to you all❤️❤️
Oh my goodness how hard it must have been for you all , I've been crying for the majority of this video and I didn't watch many videos with your dad in .  Sending my love and keep strong xxx
I’m so sorry for your loss and all the things you went through with Papa Grimes. He was a warrior and fought till the end. That was his gift for you, the way to show you how much he loved you. Rest in piece Papa Grimes.
This is so heart breaking💔. Losing a loved one is one of the hardest things a person can ever suffer through. You and your family are so incredible! You should all be so proud of yourselves! I lost my mum nearly 18 months ago and I promise you, you WILL learn to cope and be almost at peace with it. You feel their presence even though you cant see them, he will always be with you. Sending you all love and hugs xx
Sending lots of love to you and your family during this hard time❤️❤️
My dad has this illness it’s so hard😭  I’m so so sorry for your loss xx
😭😭
You are such an amazing family! Your energy and outlook on life even in the most difficult moment is incredible.  Watched it all from start to end plus full ads..I send you all so much love ❤
You never know what someone is going through so always be kind. I hope the people that moaned at you in your comments are learning not to judge so quickly. I am so sorry for your loss, I hope you and the family are doing okay 🤍
I know someone going through mnd and it’s hard especially for my older sister that has to care for him 24/7
I don’t even know you I’m crying in the first minute already 🥺🥺
Sending love this is so sad thinking of your family ❤️
I’ve never seen your videos before and came across this. Even though our stories are slightly different you’ve inspired me and have given me a little bit of hope. My grandma is dying of terminal cancer and I feel I’m watching her wither away, it’s heartbreaking and I’m going through anticipatory grief. But thank you for your video, sending you and your family so much love. Your dad would be proud 💕
I completely understand what your going through….lost my dearest daddy this year…it’s been crazy💖💖💖
❤️
I know this doesn’t make it any better, I send you and your family all the love! Your truely are a huge inspiration to all xxx
So so sorry for your loss ❤ Thinking about you all and sending love x
Sending love ❤️❤️❤️
You amazing ladies 💗💗💗💗💗💗 what a wonderful way to tell your story, I think I speak for all your followers when I say you did him proud. He'll be looking down saying that my girls! Why not all of you choose a jumper or shirt or something personal to him and have them made into teddy bears so you all have something of his forever. That's what we did when my mum in law died. Stay strong beautiful ladies.
Your mums strength is amazing she really is holding it all together what a strong lady 💗💗 you can really see the pain in her eyes losing the love of her life💗 and for you misha and your sister what a terrible thing to go through it and it all makes sense your family moving and the snippets you said in your videos.

I’m absolutely terrified to lose one of my parents. I can’t imagine the pain you’re (and so many others are) going through 🤍👼🏻
I'm sorry for your loss 😢
I’m sure he would be so proud of you Misha sending my love and condolences to you and your family during this hard time! 🤍

So so so much love xxx
💔💔💔xxxx
Stay strong. I lost my Dad, to a short illness, when I was 16. At the time, people said all sorts of unthinking things. They also wanted to see him in the latter stages of his illness, when he didn't want that, and we honored his wishes. He, too, was a very private person. Still don't regret that. Not one bit. No one can take your memories of him from you all. Love and hugs to you -and I hope that this video raises heaps of awareness and funds to help!. xx
sending you so much love🤍💕🤍💕🤍
It’s so heartbreaking 🥺 my dad got diagnosed with multiple myeloma & he’s one of the lucky ones who’s now in remission. You never forget the day you’re told the horrible news. Looking at your family is just like looking at mine. Thinking of you all 🖤 papa grimes will be so proud of you all 🖤
I am sending you all the love in the world right now 🤍 you’re both so strong and he will always be with you!
My heart cannot take this 😭 I lost my brother 16/08/2020 and I didn’t get the time with him because of covid. I totally understand the hope that the diagnosis isn’t right. I kept thinking that they were wrong even though my brother was as yellow as anything (liver failure) 😞 he was given 3 weeks in June and he lasted about 6. I have so many regrets with him but it just shows how brave they are knowing they are going so soon 😢. I always look for signs from him and I feel this is one …. His birthday is August 3rd 💔💔💔
You’re all so unbelievably strong, he will be looking down at you every day so so proud. Thinking of you all xxx
IV read the comments, I will watch when I can.... My dad died last November of mnd. Im so sorry you went through the same thing. Im still struggling so much. 1st anniversary is 1st November xxx
Sending love to you all
We love you Misha Grimes

So shocked and saddened by this news. It's just so awful what you have all been through, my heart breaks for you. I lost my mum to cancer when she was 51, I was just 13. Gone too soon but never forgotten. xxx
I’ve sat and sobbed watching you wonderful people.  My dad currently is in hospital with terminal cancer and we haven’t been allowed to go and visit him - just phone calls when all he does is cry!  Me and my sister are just heartbroken x we are desperately now trying to get him into a local hospice so that we can visit him x we just know now he has not got long left 💔
❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Your family is so strong. People don't know what goes on behind closed doors.  You should be so proud.  The help and support you are going to give so many people 💞
So so sorry for your loss 💔
Biggest hugs 🤍🤍🤍
Can only imagine how hard these two hours have been for you. You are both so strong and Inspirational 🤍
I wish your family the best through this difficult time x Thank you so much for sharing this story I know that this will of been hard but it will help so many who lost loved ones ❤️❤️❤️
Both of you did so well & it is so very very hard.But you did it so eloquently. Loved the montage of your daddy with all of you.God bless you , you are in my heart & 🙏🏻
I am so so sorry.
You’re all so strong. I cried throughout this video. A good little remembrance gift for yourselves, you can get his T-shirt’s made into a blanket or a stuffed toy. My mum did this with her dads clothes and she still has it on her bed over 10 years later. Sending lots of love ❤️
So so sorry for your loss you are so brave and strong many condolences to all your family, .
So sorry about your loss 🙏🏻
Sending so much love. There was a period of time a few years ago where my dad had cancer (thankfully he’s still with us) The treatment went on for about a year but honestly when you mention your brain blocking out things, in my head it feels like it lasted for about a week. The mind works in mysterious ways! X
Misha, I’m so so sorry. I just finished watching and it has taken me 3 days to do finish it because I couldn’t stop crying. I lost my mum 2 months ago at 48 years old, just 4 days after my 22nd birthday. I could feel your pain throughout this entire video and my heart couldn’t ache for you anymore. No child should ever have to endure the pain of losing a parent so young. Sending you all of my love always ❤️
Balling my eyes out you are so strong all of you Im sending you so much love
Can't imagine how you've been feeling. Most painful thing I've ever experienced is losing my Grandad who I loved very much. I hope your family is doing as best as they can be doing ❤️
Thank you so much for sharing your dads story. As sad as it is never ever stop talking about him & keep his memory alive. You’re all amazingly strong women and it’s so important to continue to talk about your dads illness and to keep his memory alive.   Sending all my love and support through your grieving process and the next time I see you I’m gonna squish you even harder!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
so sorry for you all
lots of love  be stromg. nothing worse than to loose your close one. be strong all of you,
Havent stopped crying watching this - I’ve lost my dad too. So much love x
❤️❤️
Sending u all so much love I know hpw hard It is lost my dad 16 years ago 💔 x
A heartbreaking watch - I've literally sat here sobbing. You girls are absolutely incredible and I'm sure in every single way you have made your father/husband proud. Sending love to you all ❤❤❤
So sorry for you loss. Sending so much love to you and your family angel❤️
Sending you so much love x
I don't know if this is the right place to be writing this as I know what you are going through and have been there myself. I would prefer to tell you my story privately as I think it would help. If there is a way to do that Mischa or kasha please let me know. I'm just a little older than you Kasha so think my story might help. ( sorry a bit cryptic but I'm not one to share my life in public. ) I just want to say that I had to look after my husband for two years before he passed away 12 years ago at 52. . I have two sons so again identify with your family. All I want to say on here is that you are both so brave to do this talk so soon after your loss . I would never have been able to do that. What you are doing is amazing and papa grimes would be very proud of you. . Ignore all the hate Mischa  as these people are worthless and you can hold your head up high to show they won't beat you.  If you think I can help with my story let me know as I'm quite happy to do so. Mean while lots of love to all of you and keep doing what you're doing. It is a long process but with the support around you , you will get there xx
Sending you so so much love and strength! So sorry for your loss ❤️xx
I’m so sorry about your husband/dad. It must have been so hard for you all. He was still so young. Sending lots of love and strength. You are so brave to make this video xx

You are all amazingly strong! I am so sorry for your loss! Sharing your story not only helps those that are going through/ have gone through the same thing, it’s shows that people have no idea what someone else is going through! The snippets of your life on YouTube weren’t even a minute snippet of what you really had going on! You should be so proud! Amazing girl and family! Lots of love 💗👼🏼
Love to you both, so much 💕💕💕

I just gave my dad a massive hug after sobbing throughout this video, thank you for reminding me not to take things for granted, and reminding me I’m very very lucky. 🤍🤍
With all your videos of fashion stuff and your mum's niftyafterfifty I've enjoyed the "fluff". But this is the most moving video I have ever watched. You are "real" people - something that gets lost on video blogging. I'm in tears, but also in rejoice, that you loved your husband/ your dad so much. Thank you for sharing. You really are a wonderful set of people! thank you xxx
Sending you all so much love , got so emotional watching this. Stay strong beautiful girls 💗💗
I didn’t know papa grimes but I just know he would be so proud of his girls.  You can just tell that you all love each other so much and shared a very special family bond,  in time girls I promise that will bring you some comfort.  RIP papa grimes, praying for you all ❤️
When my 17 year old sister died I found them crematorium the hardest part too. I think your doing a wonderful job of dealing with your grief, just remember there is no text book for it all. Cry when you need to cry, scream if you need to scream! I watched the adverts… I hope one day they fund and find a cure! 🙏🏼 also hope people learn to always be kind, u never know what is going on in peoples private lives!  I’m sorry for your loss, however he will never really be gone! 🤍🕊
Sending love to you all. Rest in peace to your father ❤️

Heartfelt condolences to all of you....sending you love and hugs xoxox
I’m so heartbroken. The part when you said that you had to tell him that it’s okay to leave broke me because we lost my nan a couple months ago and we had to tell her the same because she fought and struggled for so long to stay for us. RIP papa grimes, you guys are all so strong. Sending so much love ❤️

This video melt my heart...it's heartbreaking😥 Feel sorry for your lose😞 Never forget that Papa G look at you all the time...He is closer than you think❤ I send my thoughts,prayers and love to you and your Family. To Mama G: Jest Pani cudowną osobą,życzę Pani sił aby przetrwać ten trudny czas. Wiem,że nie jest to łatwe...bo mimo tych wszystkich ciepłych słów, które do Was spływają,na końcu dnia zostaje Pani sama ze swoimi myślami, wspomnieniami i bólem, którego nikt nie jest w stanie ukoić...pozostaje pustka i ogromna tęsknota...ale proszę wierzyć,że jeszcze będzie pięknie...kiedyś nadejdzie dzień, ze Papa G znowu Panią utuli,znowu będziecie razem,nierozłączni❤ Ale teraz jest Pani tutaj aby jeszcze wesprzeć swoje dziewczyny,które wchodzą dopiero w dorosłe życie, aby dopilnować,że będą szczęśliwe...Pani czuwa nad nimi tu,a Papa tam....Patrzy na Was i jest dumny,że ma tak wspaniałą Rodzinę. Nie ma Go z Wami fizycznie,a mimo to On jest!Wciąż blisko Was....jako delikatny powiew wiatru,który rozwiał Pani włosy,jako kropla deszczu, która spłynęła po szybie,kiedy patrzyła Pani w okno...jako śpiew ptaków o poranku...On z Wami jest❤ Moje najszczersze wyrazy współczucia❤
So sorry for your loss ❤️
This was so hard to watch heartbreaking💔 god bless your family xx
You guys took good care of your daddy you were very lucky. My father died alone in the hospital because of the COVID restrictions very hard for the family and him. ❤️‍🩹😔
What an utterly charming video.  Through your devastating sadness you have all found courage within yourselves and each other.  What a lucky man he was to have such a loving and caring family around him throughout his married life.  His soul will rest in peace, that's for sure and you ladies will live your lives enrichened by your memories of your Dad.  You have passed on some of your courage to all of us viewing this.......
So sad 😭 I lost my dad 9 years ago believe me it doesn’t feel that long ago. Your dad will always be with you, because you’ll always talk about him as if you seen him yesterday. Hugs to you & your family xx
Thank you for sharing your story ❤️
You should plant a tree somewhere in honour of your dad, somewhere that he loved!! I love this idea so much!
Firstly wow how you have handled your self is a true testament to both your mom and dad. In a world that’s challenging at times your honest and frank approach is refreshing  and much needed on this public platform. As a regular viewer I’m more fulfilled with your  videos and truly respect and understand the journey your on with that said the way your personal growth should be celebrated as your tackling very taboo topics with such grace. The message your sending is so positive and powerful self care is much more than face mask and a hot soak, it’s about taking time out to realise what’s the issue, taking the right steps for you also to ensuring you work on the issue in hand in your own way.  Your doing amazing we are all proud.  Personally more than happy to wait for your videos to resume because we only get a limited time in life ,work is a 20% part of living in the present embarking on the adventures with loved ones is 80% of life not knowing what’s going to happen next…….. Keep shining the grimes girls you go this 💕
This is so heartbreaking. As a family you should all be so proud of yourselves. Truly inspirational ♥️ sending you all the love in the world. So sorry for your loss xxxx
As someone who’s parent has a terminal illness, it’s comforting to hear the moments I dread the most were not as unbearable as I fear they will be xx
I really don’t think you’re naive, I went through the exact thing with my father except it was C*ncer. Everyone else around us was giving us these time limits on his life but we knew he had more he ended up living an extra 2 months of what time we was given.  I was 18 and I lost my best friend 2 years ago. Thankyou for this video 💖
I recently lost my grandad from motor neurones disease, and from diagnosis to his passing was about a year and a half! It was heartbreaking to see, especially not being able to see him during the pandemic but you treasure every moment you have with them. I’m so sorry about Papa G! It’s not an easy transition in life! Hopefully one day there is a break through!
So sorry for your loss 🙏
This touched my heart honestly!!! Im so sorry for your loss!! Ideas for you: you can make a memorial pillow from one of his shirts!! I did one with my grandads!! Best decision i made!! Xx
Oh my gosh!! What courage that must have taken, you both was so brave and strong going through that. I am so so so sorry for you loss💕 I was crying the whole way through thinking I could never keep myself together like that.  An idea is you could make teddy bears for you all out of him old tops and shirts. Keep going girls you are amazing xx
been a viewer for a while now and don’t usually comment but i have to say you’ve been so strong carrying on with all your content for the last couple of years after hearing that news, so brave, you two look beautiful in this video too, sorry for your loss x

❤❤❤❤❤
I was just holdin my sisters hand  we got few days left with our gilly our hearts are broken i feel like my mam is guiding  n giving us strength 🙏💔 thoughts with your family misha ❤
And this is exactly why people need to keep their noses out of other people's lives when they don't know the full story. You never deserved any of that hate and I stood by you in the comments when all I was reading were negative ones. You are so incredibly strong for going through all that and still keeping it private for your dad's sake, you are an angel on earth, that's for sure. Stay strong Misha, you will have made him so so proud 💙
Misha, I’m sending you and your family so much love right now. You’ve all been through so much and did an amazing thing for papa grimes. I just know that he’s so proud of you girls ♥️♥️♥️
Haters aren't worth the time of day. You're all so strong, heartbreaking for you all, sorry that you're going through this
In tears over this because I've gone through the pain of watching someone go through this awful journey xx
Such an awful disease, so sorry you all had to go through this!!!! My grandpa passed away with this a few years ago now and was so heart breaking to watch :( love you so much xxx
So heartbreaking 💔 so cruel what good innocent people have to go through 😔 Bless yous 💕

Sending you all the love <3 This is a verry hard part of you're jurney but you can make it trough! I believe in you guys!
❤️❤️
So sorry for your loss! When I clicked play on this video I was not expect to hear the story that real hit home for me! I lost my best friend who was like a mother to me a year ago with MND! Like you said the most difficult thing is to watch someone you love deteriorate infront of you and you can not help them! Its HARD! It started like joke, itch throat, to losing her balance then weakness in her throat and she was not able to speak anymore! Its painful, so painful. It was in the middle of pandemic and the lock down, we could not visit her! I miss her every single day! But, am taking one day at a time. Wishing you and your family all the best❤❤❤🙏🙏🙏
😭❤️
This is so heartbreaking!! But you are all amazing, and so strong, sending so much love to you all ❤️❤️
sending love darling, heartbreaking but heaven has gained another angel <3
❤️❤️❤️
I have no words to describe how strong you guys are ❤️ I genuinely don’t know how you guys got through this, you are genuinely so strong and amazing for going through this and being so strong about it, papa grimes would he so proud of you for this and you guys are so incredible for telling everyone about this and sharing his and your story❤️ this breaks my heart that you had to go through this the past 2 years but it’s inspiring to see how you’ve dealt with this and how you’re sharing his story 💔❤️
Sending all of my love to you and your family, he would be so so proud of you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
🦋💙
So sorry to hear this its never easy loosing a loved one take care of your self and your family concentrate on them and do what you need to do rip papa G ❤️ xx
Misha and momma Grimes I feel so sorry for your loss .People always have their opinions in other people's lives wish they could just be kind or say nothing .l have really missed you both take care lots of love xx
I am so so sorry. This was very hard to watch; I can only imagine how hard it was for you all to deal with- losing such a wonderful man you love so much. I wish there was something I could say. I’ll be thinking of you all. Rest in Peace, Papa G.
so sorry for your loss :(( sending my love to you and your family xxx
So sorry for your loss I totally empathise, take each day at a time you never forget you just learn to live with it 😘 try to remember all the good things xx
I've cried from the start to the end, I lost my dad when he was 44 after being ill for 12 weeks, I've forgotten how much I'd been through with him and how similar the story ...all the love, hugs and prayers, thank you so much for sharing, you girls are bloomin amazing, the strength just to put your story out there... papa G lives on in you all and he would be so proud of you all ❤❤❤ the only thing we did, was melt my dads wedding ring into two rings for me and my sister, so we could eventually both get married with them, like you all these years later I still have the jacket he wore all the time ❤
this was truly hard to watch. My dad was diagnosed with als when I was 15, now I'm 25 and 10 years later he is still with us and we are very very lucky to still have him. It's been a hard journey and it'll only get worse. I send you strength and love and thank you so so much for sharing your story.
I hope everyone who give her hate over the pandemic really sits and thinks about the horrible comments they made and doesn’t do it again because you never know what someone is going through
😭😭😭😭💔💔💔💔💐🌹🥀🌷🌺🌸🏵️🌻🌼 I'm so sorry to hear about your dad  Misha grimes we love you guys lol😇💕 I'm miss your mom on YouTube
I’m so sorry, not just about your loss but because of the criticism you received. Covid had a massive impact on our family as well, as my daughter became ill and I had to fight like hell to get her into hospital and to stay with her in A/E ( she lost her sight and they had no staff available to look after her). Initially they said brain tumour but again I had to fight to get her an MRI- when they discovered she has multiple sclerosis.  Neuro conditions can be so devastating. Treasure your memories which I hope will bring you comfort on the months and years to come.  Thank you for having the courage to share his story, honouring him in the process xxx
Wow heartbreaking. You are both so strong 🙏🏼 your dad will be incredibly proud how eloquently your and your mom are honouring his life!  RIP PAPA G 💙💙💙
i am so so sorry!😩 this is heartbreaking to hear. i can't imagine how you / your family are feeling. sending you all the love, hugs, and strength in the world💖
Sorry for your loss, sending best wishes and love to your family x
My heart breaks for you but you are all so so strong 💗
So hard listening to tihs as it all feels so familiar, just with different illnesses.  Keep talking to each other like you are.  You WILL be okay. Tihnking of things that helped me, I had an Ashes into Glass ring made and I got my Mum and Aunties heart necklaces with some of my Nana and Grandpa's ashes in them.  We all like to wear them and know they are there with us.  It freaks some people out but it is your loved ones so it is a nice way to feel them around.  Also we had a Life for A Life tree in a beautiful garden and the family go for picnics there and we meet on occasions and take the dogs and chat and just talk happy memories.  It all helps us and I hope you and your family do thing that help you along the way.  Don't put pressure on yourselves to force yourself to feel 'back to normal'.  You have had the privilege of having such a wonderful person in your life and that pain is a mark of your bond and love.  Let it come and go whenever you feel the need.  Take care of each other x
This video had me in tears all the way through😭 you’re all so strong, he’d be so proud of all of you, I lost my dad 2 years ago right in front of me, this video has brought me so much comfort even after 2 years. Sending you all so much love❤️
💗
Oh Misha and Kasha,I feel your pain.I lost my dad 2 yrs ago.He was much older than papa G,but we went thru something so similar to u towards the end.It is heartbreaking watching the person u love disappearing b4 your eyes,day by day.My dad wanted to be in his own home wen he passed away,and that’s exactly what happened.We fought to keep him in his own home. Your dad was an absolutely amazing man,so courageous.Life will get easier,but u hv to take it day by day.Sending so much love to u Misha,Your lovely sister and your amazing mum.xxx❤️
All thé love and support for you and your famille 🙏🙏🙏💙
So sorry for your loss Misha, I can feel your pain through this video. You've been so strong, sending so much love xxx
Sobbed watching this, my cousin died at age 24 it's so hard to say goodbye to the one you love, but we had a saying to keep us going no longer in our lives to share but in our hearts your always there and that's what gets you through such a sad time, you uses are so strong xx
aww misha 😢  how sad.. I'm so sorry.. cried with u guys through this video.. give mumma grimes a big hug xx
Wish I was there to help with your sadness.
You are all so amazing with everything you have been through 🤍 This video really showed how strong you all are, and he will be so proud of you girls forever 🤍
I would happily leave this video playing over and over again to give you the Adsense for this video to go to such a good cause. You guys are truly inspirational women and I’m sure Pappa G would be so so so proud of you. Sending you all the love in the world 💕
I lost my grandad to covid a few months ago and I can relate to this so much, one minute laughing one minute crying. 💕💕
Condolence to you all god bless I cried the hole way though I lost my Dad too it will get a bit easer Your Mum is brilliant rest in peace papa grimes xx
Currently going through something similar with one of my grandparents, so even just listening to you both just speak makes me feel less alone, it feels like i can cry with you both even though youre not crying with me. Its so hard to put something like this online for people to see you being vulnerable im so sorry for your loss its so sad that people were being so nasty to you when nobody knew what was happening. Mamma grimes and pappa G had one of the cutest love story of all time. RIP pappa g💙 im sorry for your loss 💗
I'm sorry for your loss.
Literally crying watching the memories of you and your father I’m so sorry no one should ever have to feel the pain of losing a parent or anyone for that matter I hope your all together right now helping each other be strong.  Sending love 😕💗
very sorry about your loss x
Sending so much love and positive energy your way, I could never imagine the grief and pain you are feeling right now losing a parent. I lost my Grandad 3 years ago and I still cry for him and miss him terribly each day, they say it gets easier, it doesn't. It just gets manageable for us to live with and go forward. This made me and I'm sure many others so emotional knowing that not only did you lose your dad, but got hate for being with him through his hard times. Never let anybody else make you feel like what your doing is wrong or unjustified. Pappa Grimes was a great man and will always be so proud of everything you all achieve and will be there every step of the way <3
So sorry for your loss❤️
You are honestly all so strong. I’m a carer and I know how hard it can be. You all made him so proud of you❤️
Sending you all the biggest of hugs 💞
This is heart breaking. I remember a few videos where I could see something was not right, but yous all kept a brave face, so sorry that you got grief from people who were unable to see something was wrong. Two years of having to deal with all of this and through a pandemic. 🥺💔 pappa Grimes is so proud of you all. Please like I've said before go to your local spiritualist church when your ready, you may have to sing a few hyms but I know  you will get a message lots of love to you all, and RIP pappa Grimes he seems like a lovely man  ❤💔❤💔❤💔
I am so sorry to you and family, no one should ever have to go through this. May you find comfort in knowing your dad had such a special life with a family he so deeply loved and adored. I'm also so sorry that while you tried to go through this all in private and maintain a brave face publicly, you received so much cruelty from strangers on the internet. It's inexcusable. I hope this may make some realise that you do not know what it happening behind closed doors so reserve your judgements and just be kind. ❤ sending you and family so so so much love
Sending you love! I really hope there is a cure for ASL/MND. I’ve witnessed this first hand and it’s awful but you are all so strong and brave to share Papa Grimes’ story. If love could have kept him alive he would have lived forever 💖 sending all my love and support c
Sending so so so much love xxxxxxxxxx
So so sorry for your loss, your dad is and always will be so proud of you ladies , ❤️❤️
Sure it's sad he's dead and what not bad if your going to try and get money and fame from it at least don't start fake crying and then cut back to you being normal again it's just so weird to watch your acting like a bad 2000s movie
❤️
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
All I can say it take things slowly and day by day , do things on your own terms not what everyone expects you to do xxxxx
I’m so sorry for your loss 💜💜💜
Took me 2 days to watch this video through. I still don’t think I can find the “right” words to say. I admire your strength. To sit down for more than an hour, to speak about your dad/husband. To tell his life story in such a small window of time and yet with so much detail, that it truly feels like we do know Papa Grimes. I think many people will agree with me when I say, we’re grateful for even the snippets of seeing him in videos/vlogs like Christmas, birthdays etc.  I’m so sorry for your loss. You’ve handled yourselves better than anyone could have ever expected, and being in the public eye and constantly facing scrutiny for no reason must’ve been so so difficult. Thank you for always being so genuine and open. Take as much time as you need. Sending you the biggest amount of love ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I have watched you for years Misha, can't believe I didn't know you and your family were going through something like this. I'm so so sorry you have lost your dad and Kasha's husband. I lost my dad to a brain tumour when I was 8 and can relate to so many of the things you say in this video, so thank you for making it 💙 it's the hardest thing you will ever go through but you will be such a strong person now and appreciate the little things in life 💙
How do u ever get over losing your parent i dread losing myn
God this is heart breaking 😭
I did not realize how much you look like your father, he was a handsome man. You are all in my prayers. I am so very sorry now I'm having trouble writting.
Sending so much love. I work as a hospice carer and I have seen and felt the pain you lovely ladies have been through. You’re so strong, and we thank strong family members like you for providing that sense of normality in their final few weeks. You got this 💪🏻 sending love and support to your family 💜💜
I'll bet he is the proudest papa up there 🤍🤍🤍
Wow I can’t stop crying this is heartbreaking. I am so so sorry you guys have had to to go through this. Sending you so much love and hugs xxx Papa Grimes is always looking over you and your family 💗💗💗
Als amyotrophic  lateral sclerosis is a degenerative condition of the neurons that send messages to the muscles it kills off all your muscles and eventually you are paralysed and become unable to breath on your own you can go on a respirator but that will only help for so long your brain stays intact so you know whats going on but just can't move or speak or do anything for yourself. Its a horrific disease and life expectancy is 2 to 5 years there are different types of als motor neurone disease some are more aggressive and symptoms devevelop faster and some people can only have symptoms on one side of their body or it may just affect arms or legs. There is currently no cure the only treatment is a tablet that gives you a thew more months to live. We need to make more awareness of mnd als and help find a cure. Rip papa grimes so sorry for your loss x
Beautiful family and a strong family  no family like the grimes ❤️💙❤️
Oh Mish I'm so so sorry you and the wonderful Grimes family had to go through this, I started sobbing before the video even started - but thank you for sharing Pappa Grimes with us, you all are so so brave and this video will help raise awareness so much, what an amazing man he was and will always be, I'm so heartbroken for you all :( I wish bad things never happened to such good people, sending all my love to you and the Grimes girls ❤️❤️  Rest in Heaven Pappa Grimes xx
❤️
Your amazing. Misha. And. Kasha  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
My heart goes out to you both and your family , it's never easy loosing a parent . I lost both of mine to cancer the same year and 5 years later  on the 1st of September I was diagnosed and  am starting my own journey . You will do him proud and will always be watching over you as I fell mine are too . Sending much love and hugs xxx
I am so sorry for you and your families loss, he would be so proud of all of you and you should be so proud of yourselves. This video was absolutely heartbreaking, sending you so much love for you all
You are such a strong family, I can’t begin too imagine what you are all going through , Pappa grimes was such a strong man❤️
It looks like they are acting...having lost my dad I wouldn't dream of plastering it on a YouTube video...the internet has really sunk to a new low.
Crying my eyes out at this. So sorry for what you all went through. I lost my dad a week before my 21st birthday, 10 years ago. He died very suddenly and unexpectedly. I’ll never forget that day. It never gets easier. I’ll donate to your just giving tomorrow on payday. Keep your chin up. You are doing him proud xx
Sorry for your loss xx
Every child’s worst nightmare. You should be so proud of yourself. He sounds like an amazing human being ❤️
You’re all so so strong 💔💔💔
Oh girl you had me sobbing!! You and your family are so beautiful and so strong!! Your dad would be so so so proud of you 💖 and those people that were horrible SHAME ON THEM, they forget people are human and have things going on in their lives!!! Says more about them then it does about you. So much love to you 💖💖💖💖
This was such a hard video to watch, you are both so strong. I am so so sorry for all of you. Losing a parent is the hardest thing 😪 I lost my mum suddenly last November. Sending you all so much love and strength to get through this ❤
my dad also died when I was 12 yrs old
I am so sorry to hear of ur loss the strength you lovely ladies have is absolutely amazing
Sending you & your family so much love, I can’t even imagine how hard the last two years have been for you all, you’re so strong 🖤
Sending you and your family so much love. Grief is the worst pain we ever feel. My little girl Belle passed away in December. She was 10 days old. It was and always will be the worst day of my life and the pain never leaves. Your dad will give you lots of signs. My beautiful Belle does, a lot Xx
Im sorry you had to endure all that hate from people who had no idea the heartbreak you were going through. You never know whats going on in someones life and should never judge. Prayers and strength to you all in this difficult time. Those we love never leave us they live in us forever💖
Thinking of you all. I am so sorry you had to go through this. Stay strong, you girls are incredible in how you are dealing with this ❤ x
Big hugs to you all ❤️❤️
Losing a parent is the hardest thing that I’ve experienced especially when you have such a close bond with them. Going through losing my own dad was an experience i never prepared for and it never got easier knowing they won’t be there to continually make u laugh, cry and annoy you but knowing that they were the most incredible parent that you were able to have throughout the years of your life is a true blessing even though the amount of time will be enough. It is so special to have those bonds and makes family even more important. Thank you for sharing your own journey through it all because no one truly knows what it is like unless you’ve experienced it yourself. You are an inspiration and everyday you are making a truly amazing man proud xxx
Sending you do much love and strength! There's no strength like the Grimes Gals. So sorry for your loss xxxx
❤❤❤❤🙏🏿
This has touched my heart truly. You girls are stronger than ever, your love for Pappa G will be unconditional and he will be there in spirit always. Grief does make you look at life so differently. And there will be days when life will be difficult and there will be days when life will a little bit more normal- but that is the cycle of grief. keep his spirit alive. Keep him living within your memories. Sending you ladies so much love- this has inspired me so much.💕
I had to watch this in two sittings because this is heartbreaking, but thank you for letting us know more about Pappa G. I went through a very similar situation when I was just 17 and lost my stepdad to cancer. I completely understand how it’s so much easier to not process what’s happening until it’s really real. It’s so beautiful when you said how lucky you are to have had your dad for as long as you did, and I’m sure he’ll be so proud of you to have that attitude. During covid restrictions when you briefly mentioned your dads health not being so great and you had a lot of negativity come your way, especially after your trip to the Maldives’s, it’s utterly heart wrenching to know now what was going on at home and how much you needed and deserved a break. Thank you for reminding everyone to always be kind. Your family is so strong, but please never feel bad for having a day when you need to cry it out. If you ever want to speak to someone who has had been through something similar please message me. Sending all my love to the Grimes family ❤️
I am truly so, so sorry for everything you have been/are going through. Papa Grimes would be so extremely proud of you all. You’re so right, he is still with you always! Keep telling his and your stories, keep talking and never stop. What a beautiful family, not just physically but emotionally. You’re in my thoughts and I’m sending so much love and strength to you all. Lots of love to you all 🤍 xxxxx
Ugg this video is so heartbreaking 💔 😢 but you Grimes girls are so strong, so proud of you❤ sending waves of love 🌊💛
♥️
Sending you so much love ❤️
Sending you all so much love at this difficult time, Papa G was a man with so much character and listening to his story had me in tears.Losing a parent is heartbreaking,but he will always be with you in spirit....RIP Papa Grimes,you were truly an amazing man xxx
🤍
❤️❤️❤️❤️
You girls are so so strong, so much love.
💔💔💔
Awww😢 Don't forget if we watch the Adverts we can support the charity.
I’m so sorry for your loss ♥️ thank you for sharing your story. You are so strong!
I’m so, so sorry for your loss. I lost my Dad last Christmas. It’s just heartbreaking. I think when you loose a parent, you never get over it, you just learn to live with it. Sending you the biggest hug I can muster. 😘
I was my dad's carer when he had dementia, and i felt every single thing you went thru with your dad. I was daddy's little girl and he was/is my hero. He fought so hard and was so physically strong just like your dad. He lifted weights until he was in his late 70s. I held his hand as he took his last breath. So devastating and I'm so sorry you had to go thru that. We love you so much....you are a brave, strong young woman
If love alone could have saved Papa G he would have been with you forever, sending you all love and healing❤️
This was absolutely heartbreaking to watch 💔 all three of you are so incredibly strong; without a shadow of doubt he would be so proud of you all 💕
I am so very heartbroken and sorry to hear this, sending all the love and prayers and healing to your family! 🕊
The most heartbreaking video, the strength that must of taken to film, my thoughts are with u all and I wish u all a bright future and happiness ❤️
Cried my eyes out watching this, you are all so strong xx
So heartbroken for you I lost my dad 5years ago hold on to the memories of all the good times it will help take baby steps sending you both a virtual hug x
It’s so hard with ALS, the brain is still very normal while the body shuts down. So sorry for your loss💕💕
Sorry one more thing. I know none of you know me from a hole in the wall but if you need to talk to somebody who understands exactly what you’re going through Misha ( I was three years younger than you) please don’t hesitate to reach out. I don’t know if anything I can say will help. But I’m always here
Sending you all so much love & hugs! Your daddy would be so so proud of all 3 of you!! ❤️
I am so sorry for your loss, I lost my father, he was only 61 and didn’t want to die because he wanted to live life with his family. It doesn’t get easier, the way you cope will. Bless you all❤️
You both look lovely!! Sending so much love your family is amazing xxxxx
My dad was on life-support for the last eight months of his life. When I look back I look back the day he actually died and they brought him back to life I kind of wish they had just let him go but then at the same time I had another eight months with him as he slowly deteriorated. So I fully fully fully understand you treasure those moments always as hard as they were. May sound a little weird but I sent a mental message to my dad to look out for your dad I’ve been having so they can hang out together. They seem to have very similar personalities of just wanting to have fun and enjoy life
Sending u love from Glasgow in Scotland ❤️❤️❤️
I honestly don't know how guys have coped 🥺 I know words are just words but I hope you all are coping as well as you can and keep all your chins up and keep yourself's going, family is the most important thing and those who mean the most to you, my heart goes out to you and the family and I send every bit of love and hugs I have to you guys 😘 I know times are hard at the moment but keep thinking about the good times, even when your feeling at the most sadest ❤️ xxxxxxx
I am so sorry for your loss. My condolences to you and your family. My dad died after a long illness with cancer in December 1987 when I was 19 years old. I fully understand how it seems it’s a long journey but yet a short journey at the same time. Love to you all
Sending all the love in the world 🥺
Im so so sorry for your life im crying my eyes out for you 😢 sending so much love your way💖💖💖💖
This was so hard to watch Misha, you Grimes’ are so so strong it’s unbelievable. 😭 I can’t even half imagine what you’ve all been through, to lose a Dad, a best friend, the love of Mamma G’s life ❤️especially this way.

My father passed away early this year. He was also 59 but passed away from mouth and throat cancer. Im only 29 years old. It was the most hardest thing i have ever had to go through. I cherish my memories with my dad they last a life time. Love everyone because you never know what is around the corner in life. I am so sorry for your loss xxxx
❤️
Such a heart breaking video cried and laughed along with you both! Your both amazing and anya of course. Sending my love to you all ❤️
You are both so incredible making this video. You did your dad so proud ❤️ sending you all lots of love xx
Both you and your mom lost the love of your life. God bless you both, I am so so sorry for the pain. Remember there is no timeline on grief, no "right" way to grieve, so take your time and let the pain come as it will. Don't fight it. One day, eventually, it will hurt less. It will never go away but you will learn who you are on the other side of it. Sending so much love to all of you.
Sending you so much love!!! What a wonderful family you have! Watched the adverts, liked the video and I subscribed. You’re incredible. You’re dad would be bursting with pride
💔😔He’s was a one of kind man, who I will miss, jokes or comments  and wisdom I could always count on.  Could always ask his for advice,  even if I had to hear the long story to get to it and then flip it to a simple “ta” when I fixed the problem or told to give my self a gold star ⭐️ 😂. I’m still in disbelief of how cruel life has been to you all, they are sent to make us stronger and I believe it will ❤️❤️❤️
❤️
God bless you all xx
I cannot imagine what you and your family must of gone through. I really sympathise with you and I’m very sorry for your loss😞 ❤️
forever sending all the Grimes girls so much love and support!! what an amazing family, he will always be so proud xx
Sigh nothing was your fault Misha. Never your fault. You shouldn’t apologize. I’m soo sorry you felt like that. ❤️❤️❤️😔... love you xxxx
You ladies are so strong and beautiful inside and out. Hang in there and thank you for sharing your story. My fiance just lost his Dad and it's been tough on us as well. My heart goes out to you both 💕
No words can possibly help or comfort at this time, but one thing I know is you girls are so strong as a family, that you will find strength to get through these times, and you will 1000% do Papa Grimes proud 💪🏻❤️ I came across your videos a few years ago and they have always entertained and made me chuckle in your own unique style, but I’m not afraid to admit this one did bring a tear.   You girls stay strong 💪🏻
Keeping you guys in my prayers ❤️
Oh boy I've literally balled my eyes out through out this! I'm subbed to your gorgeous mum and I can only say that you 2 beautiful gorgeous women are the bravest, most down to earth that I'm witnessed and I thank you for this as I think this was so raw and will help so many people going through the most awful part of the circle of life! Your family is so strong and tough and you'll get there, I wish you all the best on the next part of your journey - Papa G will never be forgotten!! xoJoanxo

Passing my love to your family during this difficult time. 🧡 RIP Papa Grimes
I cried with you girls, your amazing pappa  grimes would be so proud of you ♥️
My dad has copd stage 3, from his past career, unlike most it was caused by a chemical that is now band, he only has 1 lung working, and the other is  completely black, yes he did smoke but has since stopped since his diagnosis, however the chemical has made the lung black I think,  we've been told that he'll last another 5 years hopefully, he'll die around the age of 70, I'll be only 30. It's really hard, sending prays to you and your family 😘
My heart breaks for you this video is so emotional 😢😢 sending you so much love and strength ❤️❤️❤️
He will be so proud of all 3 of you and so grateful for everything youve done for him and for each other through all this ❤  sending all the love in the world to you all xxx

You are both so strong. I am so sorry you have had to go through this, but always remember your doing your dad proud. Sending all my love ❤️
Losing a parent is very hard to deal with, as long as you support each other though this is the main thing, my father died December 2017 of peritonitis and every year it really hits home on his anniversary because it is around Christmas time,
This is heartbreaking☹️ you are such beautiful strong ladies❤️
Your story is utterly heartbreaking, knew I wouldn’t be able to watch without sobbing! You and your family are so brave and I’m so proud of you all. Thank you so much for sharing your story and raising awareness ❤️

I'm so sorry for your loss. You girls weren't the only ones who where crying through the entire video, its so difficult to watch a person you love deteriorate that fast. I lost my dad when I was 9, and my brother was 6, and life have been so difficult. You are so lucky to have had him all this many years. Life isn't fair either, but I guess we have to manage get trough all the way up.  Much love and strength from Spain xoxo
I’m so sorry you are going through this, my dad died after fighting his battle with MND 7 years ago. I have been a subscriber of yours for years but never comment but this video touched me so much. Sending all my love to you and your family xxx
You’re all so strong, sending you lots of love and hugs ❤️❤️❤️
I'm so very  sorry  for your  great loss. Condolences from Spain xxx
If this video isn't a good example of YouTube's mob mentality, presumptions for the worst reasons, I don't know what is. If you think someone's not following guidelines, be nice about it users! Sorry for your loss!
I can't explain how familiar this is to me. Almost a mirror image of my experience losing my dad  but I don't want to burden you with that right now. I just want to say, what a wonderful family and legacy your dad has left behind. You are all beautiful souls and I will think of you all and your dad every time I have a G&T. I promise it will sting a little less with time and you'll be able to breath a little again. The best part is the beautiful memories that will come back even years later, of times when your dad wasn't ill and stories your family will tell forever. Lots of love to you all xxx
Having lost my father this hit hard and I’ve cried throughout the whole thing, thought and lots of love to you, mama grimes and anya x

You are all so brave, my family only looked after my Mum for 6 months and that was so so hard so I can’t imagine 2 years 💔 I’m so happy you got to say all you wanted to him cause my Mum was unconscious the day she passed away and that was one of the hardest things for me that I wasn’t able to tell her everything I wanted to and my Mum also hardly spoke for 6 weeks before she passed away 😔 I promise things will get better, it’s almost a year since my angel left and I can tell you things will be okay, we all have to stay strong 💪 So much love to you, Mumma Grimes and Anya 😘

So sorry for your loss. My dad passed away 3 years ago unexpectedly whilst I was at university. Stay strong but remember it is okay to cry even in random moments! The most important thing now is the memories and knowing he’s there watching. It does get easier, I promise.

Misha, my heart is breaking for your family 💔 my daddy died 3 years ago with lung cancer and his ending sounds exactly like your wee daddy's ❤️ and 3 weeks ago my wee mammy went exactly the same way 😭😭 to witness a parent pass away the way we have is heart wrenching, as sad and heartbreaking as this vlog is it gives me comfort that I haven't been the only one going through this RIP papa grimes 🙏🙏🙏

So sorry for your loss girls..Celebrate your great man, he gave you so much joy and love..rip pappa G.
I am normally a silent watcher of these 2 lovely ladies, when I watch you, I hope and pray that me and my 13 year old daughter have the relationship that mama grimes has with her girls 🥰 firstly, I am so sorry for your loss, I cannot begin to imagine the pain you have all been, and still going through. Secondly, misha, I want to say you have been incredibly strong, I remember watching your videos and seeing the pain in your eye when you was basically being bullied and u made quite clear that there was more to the story but why should you have to explain to everyone? People need to really remember the 'be kind' message, u never know what somebody could be going through! You have shown outstanding bravery  and your daddy will be so proud xx
I'm Sorry for your loss Misha
So sorry for your loss of papa grimes

My heart is absolutely breaking for you girls 💔  You girls are so so strong and Pappa G will be so proud of you all, and will be with you always 💙💙💙💙💙
You guys are so strong and so brave 💕thank you so much for making this video. My heart breaks for you. Losing someone you love is not for the feint hearted. I cried and cried watching this but had a few giggles as so many things reminded me of my beautiful dadda and how stubborn he was.  I lost my dad to lung cancer at the end of last year and was unable to visit him for 2 months after he was diagnosed due to covid and it was so incredibly scary and the thought of being far away was crippling. I went to live with him as soon as I was able to get a permit to.  He too fought so hard,  right up until the end and I too had hope that he would beat it right till the very last day. It honestly was the only way to get through some of the tough days. My dad was also extremely proud of the body he had built for himself and he was so so determined right until the end.  I remember towards the beginning, he was so determined to exercise that he used to do squats on oxygen because his lungs wouldn't let him do them on his own. Eventually all he could manage was a few steps up and down the passage but he insisted on walking up and down, up and down just like Papa G. Sending you guys so so much love ❤ On my toughest days, I remind myself, as Winnie the Pooh says "how lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard".
❤️❤️❤️
Misha you are so so strong.  Please know that your daddy will always be looking down on you all with such pride and love. I lost my daddy when I was younger so I really do understand your pain and heart ache.  I know it’s early days for you all and every day offers it’s own challenges. Please please feel free to message if you ever need anything. Me and my mum would love to help you in any way we can xxx
How amazing you both are to be able to speak about this. Thank you for your strength its truly courageous ❤️
Sending all of you love and strength in this hard time :( 🤍 may he rest easy, he will always be there to look after you and stay in your presence that’s for sure
I think This is the most raw and beautiful video I’ve ever watched

Such beautiful ladies I just want to jump in the screen and give you a hug
Thankyou for sharing such a personal part of your life , I imagine your struggling right now , but you have lots of ppl thinking about u xx
I've had to stop this relatively early in because I didn't realise it was about MND. Despite not hearing your fathers and your family's full story I can heavily sympathise with you. My dad was diagnosed with MND in October 2015, and passed away just short of 2 years on, in July 2017, when I was just 22. So I know first hand the effects both mentally and physically it has on everyone whether it be the sufferer or the family.  I can say from the bottom of my heart it hurts to hear of other people who's either going through MND or has lost someone due to MND. It's truly a heart wrenching disease. I am so so sorry for your loss ❤
I have never cried at video so much 😭 😢 💔 sending so much love & strength to you all you're such a beautiful family
Praying for you and your family. You are so strong for going through such a difficult and heartbreaking thing. I remember years ago the "ice bucket challenge" where people would pour ice on themselves to raise money for ALS research. I hope one day a cure is found. Sending love to you all ❤️❤️❤️
A beautiful vlog that must have been so hard to film. You Grimes ladies hold yourselves so well. ❤️ Papa Grimes will be proud of you all. Very touching and also helps raise awareness. Sending you lots of love xxx
sending love and prayers <3 stay strong girls xx
Aw Misha, this video was absolutely heartbreaking to watch! It’s funny because although I only know you from what you post on social media, I can’t help but feel sooo incredibly proud of you and your family! I wish you all the best for the future and I can’t wait to see where life takes you! Take care ❤️
What an inspiration you are to the world❤️ i hope we are all as strong as you when we go through these similar low times you are experiencing, sending you all my love x
Sorry for your lost babe. He’s always with you and your family no matter what ❤️
Wow! What amazing, strong women you are! Thank you so much for sharing your story, I know it can’t have been easy. You did papa grimes proud ❤️ I lost my dad when I was 6 and lost my grandad (my best friend) at the beginning of this year so I know some of the emotions you’re going through ❤️ but like you said, how bloody lucky were we to have them in our lives and to guide us on ❤️ sending so much love to you all ❤️ keep strong ❤️
Sending so much love am so sorry to you all rip ❤

Sending so so much love to you Misha, Kasha & Anya❤️x
I’m so sorry for your loss❤️❤️
The 3 of you are so strong. Losing a family member is never easy. Especially one as great as Pappa Grimes. I lost my great-grandmother in March to dementia and old age (she was 97 years young). She was the powerhouse matriarch of our family. She brought my mother and grandparents to this country (US) from Colombia/Venezuela and brought my parents together in a way. She brought us all together. She went through horrific abuse from an ex husband and she fought so hard to make her way in this country and make so many things possible for our family. My grandmother, her daughter, gave me one my great grandmother’s bibles in a beautiful custom wooden box and inside the Bible are some pictures of various family members and a small dried flower pressed within the pages. Along with a rosary from her collection that my great-aunt sent to me, they are my treasures from her. We visited her (and my great-aunt and great-uncle) often when she lived in New Hampshire about an hour or so away. I visited her in 2017 with my grandma and I’m so glad I did. We took her out for some shopping and good food and she and I watched cooking shows together in the hotel room. She was mistaking me for my mother because of the dementia, but I still felt her love regardless. I think all of the things you all are doing to remember Pappa Grimes (the necklaces, the blankets and the shirts and jumpers) are beautiful ways of remembering him and keeping him in your hearts. I know he is smiling down from heaven so proud of all of you. I make some of her recipes to keep her in my heart and I hope that one day when my partner and I get married, I will be able to wear my mother’s wedding headpiece (along with the gold owl pendant on the medal necklace that was my grandfather’s) that my great-grandmother made so that she will be there with me. Never stop honoring his memory. Love you girls!
Sending you all so much love ❤ x x
I’m so sorry you experienced the hate the internet brings while you were going through the toughest time of your life. You’re all so strong 💕
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm so sorry!! I think this was such an amazing video to put out, unless you have been involved in palliative care (as I have) people have no idea what it can be like so the fact that you have spoken in such detail is not only so brave but also so helpful to maybe prepare others a little of what is to come! Sending love xxx
Oh misha, i feel for you, truly. I’d also like to say thank you for this video. I’m going through something similar with a family member. Like you can’t speak to others as it’s there wishes. So watching this video felt like I was talking to someone who knows and honestly i salute you xxx thinking of you all
Rip papa grimes ❤❤❤ my heart goes out to you all stay strong and remember all the good memories he will be so proud of you all xx
Sending all my love
Oh Misha you are both so strong 💙 sending you all the love in the world. I messaged you about a year ago before you spoke about your dad becoming unwell as I had a feeling something was a miss and you was so lovely. This video has really hit home for me as my mum has just been diagnosed with a degenerative condition and my dad has MS so I know what it’s like to be a carer. Thinking of you all and sending you more strength 🦋
Thankyou for sharing something so personal……I wish you all well,,,xxxx
So proud of the Grimes girls ✨✨✨✨ sending love
What an incredible love your family has for each other <3
From the small snippet we saw of your dad online, we could tell what an amazing man he was and how much he loved you girls. This is so heartbreaking to watch but thank you for being so brave and raising awareness of this illness and sharing your dads story. You’re the strongest trio and you are all amazing. Send so much love to all three of you girls, and all of the family. We will all be here waiting for you whenever you’re ready to be back to filming ❤️
❤️

Thinking of you ❤️❤️
My heart is breaking for you all and i have wept throughout this entire video.  I lost my Mum to Cancer when she was just 54.  Ironically I am now the same age.  I PROMISE you that even though you feel right now like you will never breathe again....  you will not hurt like this for ever.. I promise!  Keep talking to your Daddy.. the only bit of him that died was his body and he can still hear you.  When you say you can still feel him around you.. that's because he is still around you.. and he will stay close by until he knows you are all ok.  I am sending you all my heartfelt love and gentle comforting energies xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
I’m so incredibly sorry for your loss, such a brave thing to do. Sending you all the love in the world, be gentle with yourselves, it’s a lifelong journey carrying the love and the loss 💛
You gals did all the right things.  The way he fought gave you as much hope as you could have imagined.  You kept it private as you should and did the best to take care of him.  Just remember the entire family fought alongside him and tried to help him every step of the way.  Staying away from social media was a smart move as well because nothing is more important than family and health.  Mentally it's overwhelming and you needed an outlet as well and to do this video is a form of therapy for you.  No matter what you will never regret the decisions you made in helping him through his time of need.  And this tribute to him will always be something you can refer back to and reflect back on his life.  You ladies are amazing, the strength you showed in this time of need.  I'm sorry for your loss.  Keep him in your memory 🙏🏼
You're family is in my thoughts x sending lots of love your way 💙💙
My deepest condolences to you're whole family! I'm not going to lie this is going to be a difficult time for you guys.. you guys need to cry when you need too.. the pain will get better but you will still find yourselfs missing him and crying like crazy! I lost my dad almost 5 yr  now.. and grieving a person you love so much will never end.. I still miss him so much and think of him and still cry.. but in my experience the pain has become more smiles and great memories.. than crying Everytime. Take your time grieving him don't let anyone tell you there's a limit..only you guys know.lots of hugs for all of you!
💕💕💕
So strong❤️
My Dad died when i was 5 and it leaves the biggest hole in your heart x i feel for you all so much x but you will learn to manage it and life will go on x i always feel my Dad is looking after me, his energy and his love x keep going and keep him in your heart ❤  x

I just want to say you are some strong women. I feel so much pain for you guys and I’m so sorry you as a family have had to go through this. You were amazing to him and you must remember that. He seems like the most amazing father and husband and you have to hold on to that. Sending you guys so much love 🤍you’ve got this xxxx
So very very sad but beautiful at the  same time  all  you can do is one day at a time your father’s passing was very similar as my father . Keep his memories alive . Thank you both your amazing women your pups is so proud of you all xxx
My heart breaks for you both. The father of my daughters longtime boyfriend died suddenly on monday. He was just 54. It is really hard. Take care off eachother ♥️
You can see how much love and strength you have in your family and it’s just so beautiful. I’m so sorry to hear about papa grimes, he is always with you everyday❤️
Lots of love x
You two are so brave🥺 I’ve sobbed so much throughout this video especially when the two of you cry. You two and anya are all so incredibly brave and I’m sure your daddy is so so proud of you all💙 we’re all here to support you and we love you❤️
You three lovely girls have the sweetest and the best memories ever from him.  So sorry for your loss.  Thanks for sharing this girls.
I don’t often comment on YouTube videos but this I had to… I can’t even imagine how the past 2 years have been but I can’t even believe the Strength this video has shown. Your dad would be so unbelievably proud…  Time is the greatest healer 💫 Stay strong x
This video is BEAUTIFUL. You are very strong ladies, Papa G is so proud up there x
Sending love and strength misha to you and your whole family ❤️❤️❤️❤️
You’re all so bloody strong!!! Sending so much love ❤️❤️❤️
Bless you Misha and your beautiful family. My grandad passed away from MND just a couple months ago so I know exactly what its like seeing someone you love go through that. You're so strong and I send you all my love xx
I am so so sorry for your loss. Your father sounded like an amazing person and so strong and brave- just like the rest of your family now. I recommend a book called It’s Not Yet Dark by Simon Fitzmaurice. He too went through motor neurone disease but he writes so beautifully about his experience and final years of life. Sending all my love❤️
Sending you all so much love and strength. I lost my Daddy last October unexpectedly. I didn't see him as much as I could've done, due to Covid. It was determined that my Daddy, passed from Heart disease and Lupus didn't help. Nearly a year on and it hurts just as much now, as when I first got the phone call. My Daddy's name was John too.  Lots of love and hugs beautiful xxx
Oh my goodness, I’m so sincerely sorry for your loss,  I can see the pain you are going through, the pain of loosing a loved one is unbearable, but it will get a easier I promise. There is no time scale for grief, take your time, day by day, hour by hour if need be. You will find something whether it be a smell, a song or an item of clothing that will remind you of him, try and take comfort in wonderful memories and moments you shared. Go with the flow and allow yourself a to feel every emotion, as I said it will get easier, you will never get over the loss of your daddy “Papa Grimes” you learn to live with it. Continue to carry him in your heart, memories and thoughts. I’m sure he will always be right by your side continuing to guide you through life, talk to him daily, cuddle an item of his clothing, do anything that gives you comfort. Be kind to yourself, much love to you and your family 💕 xxxxx
You’re such incredible women. So much love to you both 💛
I’m so sorry. Truly shows that you don’t know what anyone is going through 💖 sending so much love xxx
My heart breaks for you all 💕
So strong 💪 well done 👏 honestly the most ive ever cried at a vlog 💔 but so lovely watching yous talk about him.. wishing yous all the best in life.
Is that why she deleted all her videos of her dad?
Sending you all love <3
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sending the most love and strength to you lovely ladies❤️
💗💗😭😭 loved your family from the start! love you all 💗
Such a beautiful family. I hope yous all keep strong ❤️ papa grimes will be super proud of yous all ❤️
You are wonderful and you are of great courage 😿
Misha you are flipping brilliant my god..... sending love my darling xxxx
I lost a family member to MND also. It’s such a cruel disease. I am in tears. I’m just so so sorry for you all. Xxx
I forgot to say I remember when you were getting such crap during covid and girl I tried to stick up for you in the comments and I had no clue this was what you were going through but it really upset me to see so many negative Nancy's coming at you and now its even worse knowing what the real reason was and how mean they were to you.  I think you're an amazingly strong woman and I'm so super proud of the way you dealt with what you did how u did and it would've been easy to say that your dad was sick and this is why but you didn't u let say whatever and I'm sure that hurt you so much. People need to do better man seriously DO BETTER PEOPLE! I think all the haters should go donate to als research in your dad's name and memory to apologize for how shitty they were. You rock girl and you have such a beautiful soul.
we love you
You and your Mum and the rest of the family are so strong there are no words. How your mum is showing so much strength for you and you for her, is so special to watch. Sending you all the most love and strength, thank you for being so open you never owe us anything remember that!!! A real example of you never know whats going on, how you continued your channel, and life is nothing short of amazing. Thank you for this, I will always support yous 💗
You're both so brave and I am so sorry you have all had to go through this heartbreaking situation, he will be so proud of you You are all so strong and no one should have to experience this xx sending so much love ❤️❤️❤️
Currently sat here crying.. I’m so so sorry girls that all of you had to go through this. RIP papa grimes. 💗😩
So so sorry misha, mama grimes and Ana. Your dad was such an amazing man and it shows in you girls, in your videos with him and how you have dealt with such a heartbreaking time. Als is a very very nasty disease and I pray they find a cure.  20 years ago I watched a very healthy 33 year old man with a new family and life ahead of him be diagnosed with als and in 2 years was gone. The 2 years were extremely hard and what he endured was the hardest thing to see so I know what you girls are going through and I'm so sorry. Misha said this was her first funeral and obviously its your dad and its one of the hardest things and people to lose but you seem to be navigating the hard times mixed with the smiles and great memories extremely well and I think it's because you are taking this one moment at a time and you have an amazing support system. I know the hard times creep in though and they always will but with each day that passes it will be a little less hard. The first year I think is always the hardest for me when you lose someone so close. Unfortunately I've lost at least 70 people and it all started when I was very young at 10 years old. I'm 40 now so in 30 years I've lost so so so many people. The first time a holiday comes or a birthday comes and even the anniversary of their passing you really need to surround yourself with loved ones and get through  it together it really helps to not face those days alone. My grandma passed in 2015 and that was really hard for me but I surprised myself at her funeral I had my shit together and I would've never guessed I would have. Her bday is Sept 14th and every year it was such a daunting day to think about cuz I can't call and say happy birthday or I love you but each year it's a little less painful and  I'm grateful for that. Much love to you and your family and I'm praying for you all. He was very lucky to have such beautiful, kind, caring women in his life and there for him through it all and I'm sure you girls were just as lucky to have such an amazing man in your lives as well. Rip papa grimes
Rest in heavenly peace 💙
Sorry for your loss this video got me crying so much
You are all so strong OMG! Please Misha take care of your Mum because the loneliness that she is going to battle with is going to take it’s toll. However, please live your life to the full and keep his memory alive. That is what is all about!
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
You talk of being kind to others so often, I hope you are also being kind to yourselves. Sending you all the love 💖
This broke my heart - it’s been nearly two years since I lost my mum- I also told her that I’d if she needed to go it’s was ok we all love her and understand. Less than 2 hrs later she took her last breath with just my dad by her side on his birthday. They say sometimes they need to be told and then they can let go. Love to you all 😘🥰
So sorry to mama Grimes Misha and Anya. I have been watching you both for a couple of years and remember how funny he was always smiling and loving his girls.
No need to apologise, you did what you needed to do to keep your family life private. So sorry you had to go through all of this but all 3 of you are amazing, strong women ♥️ Papa Grimes would be so proud ♥️ I’m not going to lie, I was crying throughout the whole video. Sending all my love ♥️ and stay strong 😘
i’m so sorry loves i can’t imagine the pain you must feel 😢 so much love
Absolutely heartbreaking rip papa grimes 😔xxx
So so sorry for your loss 💙 sending you all so much love xx
Sending you SOOO much LOVE!!!! You are amazing ladies and he will be so proud of everything you achieve!! Xxxx
I love you both so much. Being hopeful is always beautiful and if it helped you to get through the pain it makes it even more beautiful. Papa Grimes was so young and so sweet. I’m literally sobbing and Mama Grimes is being such a Mama for you even though her grief is so great. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥰😭😭😭💋💋💋🌹🌹🌹❤️❤️❤️❤️
Losing a parent is hard no matter what age you are. I lost my mum when I was 12 and there’s not a day I don’t think about her, just remember your dad will always be with you in your heart.
You are both amazing ❤️❤️
Never commented on anyones videos before thank you for sharing your journey with us .your dad will be so proud of you misha 💙 your dad will be right buy your sides watching over you your family are so honest and strong .my heart is breaking for you all you all have each other to love xx
You should both be proud, you’ve been incredibly brave and strong sharing your story and raising awareness. I used to write my grandad letters when he first passed away and I was finding it hard. I think also just being able to talk about better days really helped. Wish you both and Anya all the best through this journey xx
Keep a card/letter/anything him his handwriting and you can make it into a necklace/bracelet so that he is close to you forever.  Keep anything you have with his voice in it so you never have to forget how he sounded- so lucky you have so many incredible videos with him, you will treasure them ❤️
You're amazing Misha! He will be so proud of you x
Thoughts to you all xxxxx
This broke my heart. Sending you and your family so much love 💜💜 xxxxxx
This is Absolutely heartbreaking yous both done amazing making this video with something so personal and raising awareness about this illness and it really does highlight that people should always be kind because you just don’t know what people are going through ❤️ papa G will always be watching and he’ll be so proud
I haven’t watched you on YouTube before but came across this video and wanted to say I’m so sorry for your huge loss and I’m sending so much love to your whole family 💔
Wow, you girls are so so strong & inspirational. As long as you all stick together yous can get through anything! Sending so much love and strength to you all, it is such a heartbreaking situation but you have told his story so well and I can’t imagine how unbelievably proud of you all he is!🤍
sending my love♥️
What a strong & brave family! ❤️ I can’t begin to imagine the pain! Didn’t skip an add throughout and I think it’s beautiful you are raising money for the charity!  Sending so so much love to you and your beautiful family xxxx
So sorry for your loss girls, so heartbreaking xxx
Oh misha your such a strong beautiful human and im so sorry you and your family are going through this, i dread the day i loose my sweet parents and dont know if i could be as strong as you ❤ this is also the reason i never ever make any bad comments towards peoole because you never know what there going through, i had a feeling something was going on in your family from your videos, your daddy will be so proud of you sweetheart, sending all my love misha to you and hour family xxxx
Sobbing. I am so so so sorry, sending you all of the love in the world. You are all so strong ❤️
I’m so so so sorry for you misha and your family and of course for papa grimes who deserved many more years :((( I can’t begin to imagine how awful it must have been for you all :( grief is the price we pay for love ❤️❤️ you have been so lucky to have been loved by papa grimes and to have loved him <3 stay strong xxxx
Absolutely heartbreaking but he knew he was so loved by you all ❤️ xx
I lost my dad in 2014 due to a doctors fault his last day I had to carry him to the bathroom this is so heart breaking so sorry you had to go through this ♥️
You all are such beautiful strong women, I was balling my eyes out hearing your story 🥺 Pappa G would be so proud of all of you ❤️✨☁️
This is such a heartbreaking video, but try you’re best never to lose hope in life. Hold onto all the memories you made before and after you found out. My FIL was diagnosed with it and he passed away within a few months and at the time the drs said at the time. Losing a parent is never easy, it’s not been a year since I’ve lost my mum and that empty feeling you have inside never goes away but you learn to try. Doing this video shows how strong you are and don’t even feel you have to feel bad for not explaining yourself to anyone. No one has the right to judge you, Covid or no Covid when u know a loved one is so unwell you’re not going to stop seeing them. Lots of love to u all 💞
Oh my heart.. 🥺💔 this broke my heart to pieces. You girls are so incredibly strong.  I lost my own father at the age of 58, to cancer of the throat. And I remember him choking quite a bit with phlegm, it was very hard to see. I’ve watched you for a while now. But this is so hard to watch. I share in your pain and loss. The world really doesn’t prepare you for the loss of a parent. 💔 I’ve donated money to your just giving page. sending you so so much love and gentle hugs! I hope to meet yous one day! 🧡
Misha and Mama Grimes, your strength is impeccable ❤️ I laughed and cried watching this, thank you for using your platform during such a difficult time in your life to raise awareness! Alpha Papa will be so proud.
Sending You and Your Family Soo much Love So Sorry for your Loss Your Courage to make this video is a testament of How Brave You Are ❤xx

I sure hope peace finds you and your family in the tuff days where it is hard to find. Love. :)
I lost my older brother 11 years ago so I can understand how you feel  . The pain would not go away that easily and it will never leave you  , the tears will still fall, but less frequently… But eventually it would get better and better everyday . ❤️ my heart goes out to your family xx
This is so heartbreaking! We are all so proud of you !!! Lots of love😘😘😘🥺
So sad to hear this story. I lost my dad on the 17th September last year. He had bowel cancer and passed away 7 months after his diagnosis.
My Nan passed away of motor neurone disease 3 years ago with no notice! I’m so glad you had the chance to make amazing memories and make the most of the time you had together. You are both so strong and inspiring!❤️❤️
You’re both amazing I’m sorry so sorry for your loss he’s with you every day xxx

Such a heartbreaking video, I cried with you both throughout. But it is amazing to raise awareness of such a devastating illness. Misha I am so sorry you had so much hate during this, hate is bad enough at any time but when you’re going through such a tough time like this it just have been awful for you. This is why people need to stop hating as it just shows you never know what anyone is going through. Sending love to you all ❤️ xx

Your truly an amazing family and I know you will get through this together but you are all so strong 💪
I had the absolute honour of serving Mumma G and Anya at work this week. They told me they’d come to enjoy pappa Gs favourite lunch & cake. I admire this family more than words can comprehend. Sending umpteen amounts of love x
Oh misha it’s so heartbreaking it’s the worst thing to go through in the world sending you and your family so much love ❤️xx
Literally sobbed the whole way through this......you girls are tough. He will be with you every step of the way. As a carer for someone with MND ALS. I know exactly what you have gone and are still going through. Misha if you ever fancy a trip to liverpool come and stay at mine. Honesgly you are more than welcome with me and my little man xxx
Lost my daddy suddenly 4 weeks ago. He was exact same age as your dad. It's unbearable.
You are both amazing ❤️ your mum is just the sweetest xo
Soo heartbreaking. Soo sorry for your family. I sobbing soo hard. Love and hugs and take care.
My grandmother passed away from motor neurone disease, my mum was in her 20s and had me in her 30s so I never got to me her parents. Her mum was also quite young when she passed 🥰
I have never watched two more strong women in my entire life!!! This is heartbreaking, crying tears for you but also in awe at how amazing and selfless you are to Papa G to the very end. He is so fucking proud of you all!!!
I’m so sorry to hear of your loss Misha… 🤍❤️ My heart and condolences goes out to you and to your family.😢 I lost my father a couple of days after you’ve lost yours, also to illness and know how hard and raw it feels…💔🤍 the wish of being able to hear their voice or see them again one last time is always there, but we have to be strong for them and keep all of the good memories alive! Thank you for sharing your story… I feel like this has really helped me. 🙏 Our story is very very alike of what happened and the process, so this is almost hearing myself speak of my own dad and his story! Please may you receive a huge lovingly virtual hug, and may God give you all the strength to go through it all! Until one day we meet with our daddy’s again! Xxxx ❤️🥰🤍😢💔
Your are so strong. Lots of love to you both. This is so heartbreaking ❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is one of the hardest yet most beautiful things I've ever had to watch 🥺 I'm so incredibly sorry for your loss but the combined strength you girls have as a family is amazing to see and you can truly see the love you have for eachother 💖
You are so brave. Thank you for sharing your story. Take care x
This was incredibly moving so sorry for your loss you and your mum are very brave you’re dad now is at peace and pain free sending prayers ❤️
This makes me so so sad. Everything you family went through :(. This is also a reminder that people need to keep there noses out of people’s business and that you don’t know everyone’s story and there life. People make too many assumptions and poor misha and her family going through all of that with people commenting on what misha was doing through covid. My thoughts are with you and your family x
Oh and you’re definitely not crazy talking to him in the clouds, I often do it with my grandad and it helps.   Maybe you could turn his shirts in to a teddy bear xx
I am sending your family and loved ones all the love in the world, I can’t imagine your pain💔 you are so strong ❤️❤️
My mum had MND and I feel your pain so much. I lost her to the disease last year and was mums full time carer too. This was almost like deja vu with the stuff that needed discussing and the conversations you have to let them know it’s ok to leave us and be free. 💔 Just hold onto all the memories you have made with him in them 2yrs - it’s what will get you through the bad days 💙💙💙 xxxx
Two incredibly strong women ❤️ & a beautiful family. He will forever be proud of you xxx
All three of you including papa grimes are extremely strong! Looking after my mum when she was poorly with cancer I know how hard it is looking after someone you love. Especially your parent! However you guys gave him the best 2 years 💗  It’s amazing you made this beautiful video, especially to raise awareness of ALS. Which I only knew so little about before this video.  Stay strong beautiful girlies 💗 you are all amazing 💗 I’ll be sure to share the fundraising page 😘

You are so so brave. I wish you all the strength and happiness in the world ❤️
It's so sad looking back at the clips but so funny too. Pappa G was so funny ♥️♥️ RIP Pappa G. I lost my dad 14 years ago and think about him every day. You guys are so strong and brave ♥️♥️ you guys did everything you could for him, even selling your beautiful home, and doing anything and everything you could do for him. WOW did Pappa G fight a absolutely horrible disease to save himself that's for sure, he didn't just give up like some people would and that takes a lot of fight. I would personally like to apologize for our little outbursts back then 😂 when we never knew what was going on and we obviously would never ever have said anything if we Knew x
You girls are so strong, your daddy is always with you, never forget that ❤️❤️❤️
This video broke my heart into a million pieces🥺I’m so sorry for your loss, the strength you ladies have shown is incredible. Rest in paradise papa grimes😓❤️

My grandad passed away two years ago with MND and it’s an awful disease. I am so sorry misha I feel your pain so much xxx
So sorry for your loss. We lost my father inlaw less then 2 weeks ago and was such a shock. We got told he had cancer on the Friday and he’d left us on the Monday when I was on my way to find out what his first child was so we could tell him before he passed. Sadly he couldn’t wait but he knows.  Much love to you all xxx
Oh Misha ♥ You were both so strong through this Video, you might not feel it not but you are so strong and Papa G will be so proud of you ♥ xx
Oh Misha I'm so sorry for the grief and RIP daddy Grimes
🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
I'm so sorry for your loss. Always have hope it gets you by. It isn't foolish at all sending my love to you all.
The strength you and your family have Misha is incredible. I can absolutely feel your heartbreak and what you went through from hearing your dads story. Sending love and strength to the grimes gals you are all amazing 👼🏼🤍
I was strugling so much, watching this video, crying all the way through it. Have no words to say how sorry I am for your loss. I was going through something similar, many years ago, when my grandfather passed away. He was like a father to me. One night, when I was in my bed, feeling so sad, crying, I felt someone sit on the edge of my bed, but there was nobody there, and I really do believe, it was him, telling me "don't be sad". I also believe Papa Grimes is still with you, watching over you.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow. What an incredibly loving family. I’m so sorry for your loss. This was such a heartbreaking video to watch. Thank you both for sharing your journey and bringing awareness to MND. RIP Papa Grimes ♥️♥️
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I was a carer for my Nan during her last weeks and I know how difficult it is to go through that journey!  But it makes you so much stronger!  Sending you all the love! 💛
You both are the strongest people I've come across ❤  sending love your way 🌹
😭😭😭😭😭❤❤❤❤❤
Oh my god, I'm so sorry for your loss❤️ you're handling your grief like absolute champions. Thank you for sharing his story
Heavens. Sending you all loads of love. Always remember that you can all grieve in your own way and nobody has the right to tell you to get over it. 🤗💓

I’m so sorry for your loss, you’re all inspirational & a credit to him, he will never leave you🤍

You’re both such an inspiration 💛💛 I’m sending all the amount of love I possibly can through a screen ❤️ thank you for this video!

Oh Misha, this video is so heartbreaking, I am so sorry you and your family have had to go through this 💔 - I’ve been sobbing throughout 🥺. You and your mum are amazing and you did your dad SO proud with this video with the strength you both shown. Whilst it was so heartbreaking and upsetting listening about everything you guys have gone through these last 2 years as a family - it was also so insightful into your dads illness and no doubt it will really help raise awareness and also allow others to relate to this. Papa Grimes was an incredible man and he will be forever proud of you all 👼🏼❤️. Sending so much love and hugs to you, your mum and sister. Xxxxxxxxx
Your family’s strength is unbelievable 🤍

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Loosing a parent is never easy ... I lost my mother 15 years ago now (I was 19) and I will not say time heals (coz it doesn't) but through time, you learn how to adapt and live with the loss... It hurts to this day, I still cry, and I miss her dearly ... But, as you said, he's still here with you, so keep that close to you <3 also cherish every moment you spent with him, coz the memories will never die xx big hugs to all your family and keep strong xx
Girls you have done papa grimes so incredibly proud. Sending all the love to you. Keep his memory alive ⭐️ Xx
Never related to a video more in my life, the strength of the Grimes Girls is incredible. We all want you to know that we love you and appreciate how you've allowed us into this personal part of your life and chosen to talk about your grief and the beautiful life of your Dad. All the best from an aussie who lost her Mum to cancer xxx
Love you all 🤍🤍
❤️
I'm so sorry for your loss. ♥️♥️♥️ incredible family. Sending you so much strength xxx
I'm really sorry to hear this and what you have gone through. I hope you can take comfort in your memories and the fact that you had, what sounds like a wonderful celebration of his life.  I sadly lost someone during lockdown and having to select who can attend the funeral due to limited numbers was a horrible experience. Take care all x
Love you
It’s heartbreaking to have to say goodbye to a family member. I’m so thankful that you shared this and are talking about your dad. He would be so so proud to know his daughter is helping people to heal and to be more open. Love you mish ❤️

This video broke my heart, thinking of you all and your strength is amazing. Sending all my love❤️
I've been through similar situations with both my parents who've passed. I know the pain and grief, but you did everything you could to keep Papa Grimes comfortable and show him so much love. I'm praying for your family that you hold onto the good times and that the sadness will lessen over time. He's looking down on you with pride and love at your strength and perseverance knowing you'll be alright. He was such a wonderful man and the proof is how special and beautiful inside and out his family turned out. Sending your family, Misha and Mama Grimes all of my love.💖💗💖
Sending so much love to you all 🤍. This video really touched my heart and can’t even imagine what you all have been though 💛. I have had to deal with really difficult grief too within the last year so I can feel the pain🤍. You both have spoken such  beautiful words throughout this video and I just want to send all the love to your family and the strength that he will always be so proud of you all and forever he will stay in your hearts 💛💛

RIP Papa Grimes.  I lost my husband on fathers day in June of this year. He was my main carer but family helped and a carer in a morning. I have had to move into a nursing home. Leaving home is so hard and towards the end of living at home it did not feel the same. I suppose I felt pushed into the home and I had to move area because I am only 49 and no homes would take me apart from one. I would not of left my cats with them. The grief is immense but you are all very close which will help you all. Grief is different for everyone and losing a parent is heartbreaking. I lost my mum a week after having my  youngest child. That's the time when you need your mum the most. Even now 21 years something happens and I want my mum. People say it gets easier but I think you never get over the loss, it's a case of trying to remember the fun times that you all had together. Take care Grimes girls if you want to chat I am here ok. X
I'm so sorry for your loss. I can't even imagine the pain 😢 wish you all the best 💛
Its unconditional love and it is what got you to the end and it will continue ...he was loved & this is what matterd he clearly witnessed it Pace yourselfs sending lots of love maria xx
I’m so sorry for your loss, Misha. My uncle died from Motor Neurone Disease in 2008, a week after his son’s fourth birthday. It was so hard to watch him go through that so although I have no idea how you feel losing a parent I do know what you went through with that horrible disease. I’ve barely started the video and I’m already crying for you. I loved the montage at the start, your Daddy was clearly a wonderful, caring and hilarious man. My thoughts are with you and your family. Rest In Peace Papa Grimes
Sending you lots of love Misha ❤❤❤❤ such a strong person ❤❤
👍💪💪💪💪💪💪💪❤
Sobbed from start to finish watching this 🥺❤️ I’m in awe of the strength of your family and the grace with which you’ve dealt with it all. Papa G is so proud of you 🙏🏻 👼🏻
❤️❤️❤️
I’m so so sorry for your loss, what an amazing man, you are so strong, so inspiring, thank you for sharing your story, we’re all here for you when you want to come back, take as much time as you need, lots of love to you and your family through this time x
So sad to watch this video, such a strong family, I'm sure your daddy will be watching over you and will be very proud. Keep going your all doing amazing ❤️
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I just got to the end of the video where you’re talking about sentimental things, for my birthday last year I got a teddy made from one of my Mum’s dresses. I’m not sure if this is up your street, but it’s comforting for me 🥰
Thank-you for sharing your story when I was loosing my best friend/grandmother to cancer so many people didn't understand and couldn't understand the pain of watching the person you love leave piece by piece. you are so strong and beautiful and he would be so happy and proud of you all ❤️❤️❤️
Motor Neurone Disease is heartbreaking. My Grandad had it for 7 years and seeing him get worse over those years was horrible. I really hope that a cure or medicine is found to help / stop this awful disease. Well done for sharing this story, it needs to be talked about more xx
I'm so sorry for your loss Misha, Kasha and Anya. I love how strong your family unit I hope Anya has a outlet like you both do. Grief is a horrible thing to go through, I'm currently going through it and it is difficult so continue to be strong for papa grimes but remember it's okay to not be okay and it's okay to cry. So proud of you Misha ❤️
Rest in peace Papa Grimes🤍
Love to you all. I can relate in so many ways. Lost my dad to mnd in 2010. Diagnosed on my birthday 2007. My dad was 62. Loosing speech and feeding ability.  Its heartbreaking. Please try to advocate mnd awareness.  You are on a high platform to do this. Once again love to you all and so sorry you have been through this.  X
This is so heartbreaking! I’m thinking of you and your family misha! He will be so proud of you!🤍🤍
12:05 I have paused to say don’t you ever apologise for anything Misha!! I knew back then something wasn’t right and that is why I supported all your decisions in the first lockdown. Your a sweetheart and very loved. The people who have put you through shit online are nothing and nobody’s. I love you and mumma grimes and anya! We love and respect and support ALL your decisions. Now I’m going to continue watching you tell the beautiful story of daddy grimes . Xxxx ❤️🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼❤️
🤍🤍🤍

You and your mum are so strong ❤️ and you are so right, you never know what someone is going through so must always be kind 🤍

He was such an incredible man, I’m so so sorry you’ve had to go through this 💗 You all did the most amazing job of looking after him, I’ve been crying and laughing with you all the way through this video 💗 sending you all the most love in the world! xx
❤️❤️❤️
Absolutely heartbreaking, my grandad passed away from motor neurone disease (age 58)  21 years ago today, and this hit home. It’s a bitter sweet feeling knowing that they’re not suffering whilst also knowing you will never see them again. It breaks my heart how little people know about this, spreading awareness is how you can relive his memories🥰❤️
Your family is so strong ❤️❤️
My aunt had Alzheimer’s/dementia and was ill for about 7 years before she passed it’s distressing watching that process happen but the memories before she had taken ill are what get me through it gets easier in time I don’t think anyone could watch this video with blubbering I know I couldn’t sending love ❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰🥰🥰
This was such a hard video to watch I really am so so sorry for you and your family. Life is not fair. Your doing him so proud 💕
I’ve never cried so much at a video! It is so heartbreaking to hear your story but you are incredibly brave for sharing it! Your dad sounds like a hero and he would be so proud of you girls!!! Sending lots of love and hugs xxxx
I'm so sorry for the loss of Papa Grimes, I can't imagine what you all went through😔 You are such a strong family & he would be so proud, sending so much love to you all🤍x
When my grandad passed away we got the shirts he wore made into cushion covers. It sits on my bed and I’m reminded he is always with me. I’m so very sorry for your loss. Sending lots of love and hugs to all of you.
Am idea to do is get someone to make quilts out of his clothes so each of you can have one.    I have lost my brother he was 22 to a drunk driver. Lost my little sister to a drug overdose she was 34. And watching both of them come off of life support changed my life forever. It was the 3 of us and now I am an only child. I look up to my mom and just how strong she is every day. Mamma Grimes you are amazing. And Misha and Anya stay strong. Put one foot n front of the other. This will make you all even more strong every day. Lots of love and prayers. RIP Papa Grimes you will be missed by so many. 🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️🙏❤️💔💔💔
So proud of both of you…the strength you both have shown is out of this world! Sending all three of you so much love💛☀️💛☀️

We spent the last weeks of my husbands life also focussing on finances etc. I feel regrets too but we also had hope he’d survive. I had to ask him for his passwords etc and where the pension and life assurance details were. It was horrid xxx

I'm so sorry for your loss ❤ I wanted to share a poem I love.  "He's in the sun, the wind, the rain,  he's in the air you breathe  with every breath you take.  He sings a song of hope and cheer,  there's no more pain, no more fear.  You'll see him in the clouds above,  hear him whisper words of love,  you'll be together before long,  until then listen for his song."
Thoughts and prayers going out to you and your family! He was always a joy to watch in your video and you could tell what a wonderful loving funny family man he was!!
I’m so sorry for your loss… what an incredibly lucky man to have such a loving family and such an amazing strength of character ❤️ Sleep tight Papa Grimes xx
I’ve watched you on YouTube and recommended your social media to countless people, I had absolutely no idea what you were going through but what I did know from the moment I started watching you is that you had the most loving, hilarious and gorgeous family! You are so strong to even get through a video talking about your wonderful Dad, I’ve cried all the way through thinking about my own loved ones I’ve lost.  All my love and support to you Misha and your lovely family, this will be so so hard but you all have each other and that will get you through ❤️
Such beautiful memories, love you two incredible amounts so so so strong, papa G will always be so proud of you all ❤️❤️❤️❤️
You gave him a great send of he would be so proud ! & mumma grimes your relationship with papa G is something so special that everyone deserves 🕊
I can’t even begin to imagine how your family is coping and handling this, yous are so brave and I’m sure papa Grimes is and always with be with yous🤍🕊
RIP Papa Grimes. 💔You are the incredibly strong, both of you. It's an awful process to go through and see someone fade before your eyes. Your dad will be so proud of your future successes. I am so sorry 😢
Such beautiful videos of papa grimes, thank you for sharing those with us. You’re both so brave for doing this video, sending you all so so much love 🤍
💔💔💔💔

My mum suddenly passed in November from Covid, she was previously active and healthy and the doctors couldn’t understand why it’d taken over her so rapidly, and before she was taken to hospital she’d booked holidays, she reserved a puppy, my mum and my dad were coming up to 36 years of marriage and 38 years together, she’s got 5 children and 5 grandchildren and of course her first and only love, my dad… and the one thing that breaks me more than anything is that in the hospital she knew she wasn’t going to come home… and I just can’t even begin to fathom how that must feel, just like you said about your daddy🥺❤️
I am so sorry for you loss. You had every right to keep it all private.
So so sorry for your loss ..I just lost my dad a month ago 😥😥
Have just cried on and off the whole way through this, you’ve put this across so eloquently and well! You girls are so strong, I’ve never dealt with anything like this myself and couldn’t even being to imagine… you’re absolute superstars and your guiding star is looking upon you shining brightly! Continue doing your Papa G proud🙌🏻🎉🌟
Angel I’m so so sorry 😢. I had a idea it was Motor Neurones Disease! My managers wife passed away with it and I saw just how much effect it can have not only on the person but the people around them! Every time you’d justify going from place to place but mentioned you never know what’s going on in a persons life is why I never questioned it as when someone says that that’s an indication they’re going through something tough, so should leave you the hell alone! You might not feel it but you are so strong, to put this video out there and share papa grimes story to raise awareness and money is so commendable. He’ll be the proudest daddy in the world, every day he’s with you! I’m just so sad that at the time you were dealing with this people were giving you shit, without thinking of the circumstances! People are shitty! Sending you and your family so much love ❤️❤️❤️
❤️❤️❤️
I'm so sorry for what you're all going through. Sending you all so much love, I lost my Dad in May after given only 2 days so I said my goodbyes and he managed 2 more weeks ❤ you are both SO strong 🥺
You don’t have to apologise! You are so right people don’t know what you’re going through. Please look after yourselves and take all the time you need ❤️
This videos is heartbreaking. I have been watching you for such a long time and it’s so upsetting watching you both so upset.   Papa grimes is and will always so proud of all his girls. We will always be his sunshine.   Try to remain strong and keep talking about how you feel, try not to bottle it up as what you are going through your family will be too.   Hugs and best wishes ❤️❤️

You are absolutely amazing and I am so proud of you for telling this story. Sending so much love to the three of you Grimes gals 💜💖❤️ xxx
My husband the same but stage 4 cancer. Keen cyclist - much fitter than me. Got two years. Died at 38. Two young daughters. I am so sorry for your pain. He was diagnosed in May 2019. Because of covid we didn’t leave the house for any of the lockdowns. I was 37 weeks pregnant with our second child when he passed away in the hospice. Covid ruined his last few years but I promised him I would travel the world on his behalf.
Ignore all the haters and it was and never will be your fault your a strong and amazing young lady who cared about her dad ❤️❤️❤️
oh Misha, this video was amazing, you both were so strong throughout all of this🤍 I lost my Dad 7 years ago when I was 16 and it’s the most heartbreaking thing,  just remember that they are always around. Sending you all soooo much love ❤️❤️
