They, in fact, failed to bring back the Christmas Island Rat. D’oh
These 2 have to continue. Priceless!!
Holy shit the women's day joke was so good XDD
I need a new butt. I thought Bruce Jenner wrote that during his first week of having sex as Caitlyn.
“I hope they remember to smile”. 😂
That remember to smile joke was fucking amazing
Whoever the writers are, they really stink the last couple Mnths.....bleh
that Jost joke is funny 'cause it's TRUE!!! 😂
Right! The other option is NOT 🙁😒🤮
Yo. Josty. Guess 🎶 WHOO-OO🎶😃👈 Recognize this face?? No?? -Of course not. Unfortunately it's the anesthetic face mask I now have to wear EVERY where I GO! Do you think SHOOTING Cleveland Browns fans in the FACE, is still FUNNY?? I'll see you in COURT, "cash cow"!!  - Bernie Kosar
Dear Mr. Che,   It's me, Doris from 23B. It's been 6 months since my mom left on her business trip to Japan. Please return our bathroom plunger, before the landlord forecloses on my house...if I get the deposit back, I can return my half of the abortion money to you. I still love you, Michael.  I'll see you back home in Jamaica.💝🕊       - Doris O' Sullivan jr.👩‍🦽
The Circus is in town, that's all I can think about when I saw that truck of 💩
I must've woken up my entire house on the International Women's Day punchline. Jesus!!!!
They are the only reason I watch the show
Not
The bad thing is that Jost makes nearly double what Che makes.
I'll give you Cracker Barrel! I always thought that.
Apparently queen Liz's body is a wonderland
boring bit alert:   The boring truth is that Queen Elizabeth II moved out of Buckingham Palace because she was tired of walking the long hallways and climbing the long staircases.   She is in her ninth decade of life.   If she wants to move to her smaller spare palace she should do it.
These two might be the best since Norm Macdonald.
Men pee all over the place in NYC. You see it all the time. And most of the men who do it are the ones who carry weapons. So yeah, no we’re not gonna make a big deal about it.
International Women's Day - "hopefully" they can remember to smile (how is this not the biggest 3d burn ever?)
This one was surprisingly interesting AND FUNNY!
The squalid octave conclusively bruise because custard superficially subtract mid a determined bat. adaptable, elegant rowboat
Che and Jost just kill on Weekend Update. Hilarious writing too. I watched the original SNL cast, and never thought anyone would surpass weekend update in that cast. Che and Jost have done that.
I just found that butt book here's a video of someone reading it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHumVXvMuUU It's a cute book HIRE THEM BACK!!!
Sharp without being political. I like it.
That "remembered to smile" joke...man I felt that...didn't u ladies? If I had a nickel for every yahoo I ever heard make that joke lol
Putin is a War Criminal and a Thug!!  He and his Generals should pay the Ultimate price for killing children and pregnant women!! He is a Dictator, and we all know how they end up!
Damn Denver on SNL??
Oh man, this set was so good!
Man, I need to read that book "I need a New Butt" as I just ate at Taco Bell!
Anyone else tired of all this racial shit?
Annnnd Che gets this round. I swear I could watch just two hours of this every week! They should just do a show together at some point. Weekly news format.
WOW, SNL is no longer funny. Pathetic excuse for "comedy".
😅😅
I've seen it - I'd move in permanently with him too!  --Dave, there'd probably be room for my books...
“It’s your old pee-paw” killed me! Lmao
The Arby's punchline would've been funnier if the voice said "Arby's. We have the meats. All of them."
It almost looks like they wrote each other's jokes again- hilarious
Arbys after 📉
That was dope! Colin Jost the first! And l like imagine his lovely wife with the CROWN SHE DESERVES.
Weekend Update is always the best part of SNL, and this one did not disappoint!
That's so funny John Travolta because only white people are ignorant to other cultures & countries. Also pronunciations of names from different countries. I get it That's so funny hahaha, the first white suppressor collin Jost. I love that band tool
Somebody please make this stop. I waste a couple minutes of my day hoping the jokes will get better.
We good
Haven' t watched SSL for the past at least 6 years .... talkin' bout good show going down a toilet - what a garbage !!!
Hey SNL, just give us a 30 minute special of weekend update!
I miss Norm McDonald doing weekly update.  No hate towards Colin and Michael but their jokes are so simple you know the punchline the moment they start telling the joke.
Well, we know who’s not a sponsor of the show.
Not the Arbys
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
A total rogue’s gallery of evil.
Speaking of  white rabbits "Saturday night fever" that's a positive reinforcements.
On a roll this week
Weekend Update is the ONLY thing entertaining about Saturday Night Live now.  Hosts that no one knows 99% of the time, absolute horrid musical guests and the absolute worst writing in show history.  It is a disgrace!!
"Until they were driven out by wealthy industrialist Colin Just the First". Love it when these 2 make jokes about each other
One of the things I love about Che and Colin's chemistry is whenever Che rags on Colin, Colin's initial reaction is hilarious!
Hilariously
Brad’s wife liked that Cracker Barrel joke
WHATS IN THE BOX!! apparently the meats.
The World's Top Ten Funniest One Liners ever!  1. I didn't fight my way to the top of the food chain to be a vegetarian.  2. I used to think I was indecisive, but now I'm not too sure.  3. He who laughs last thinks slowest.  4. According to my best recollection, I don't remember. 5. A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory. 6. Gravity: It's not just a good idea, it's the LAW! 7. Be nice to your kids. They'll choose your nursing home. 8. If Barbie is so popular, why do you have to buy her friends? 9. I just let my mind wander, and it didn't come back.  10. Vacation begins when Dad says, "I know a short cut."   Maybe the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates ~ 🎈
No these two are not funny. Please bring back poehler and fey.
I was searching for what the word was that they're doing away with and its...."S•q•u•a•w". From what I can gather there nothing even inherently offensive to the term, and is literally just a word used for Native American women with their children because it was derived from certain small sections of Native Americans languages. In other words, American settlers had no idea what anyone was saying, so they grasped on to small snippets of talking and that became a label. But its not meant as derogatory and doesn't even have actual meaning outside of female Native American usually a mother. What ACTUALLY happened was Deb Haaland was bored so she decided to waste more money we don't have by declaring a word inherently offensive and racist because shes Native American. No really. Thats what I figured out from 3 minutes on Google. She had nothing going on so she literally declared a word inherently offensive, and then decided shes wasting money changing a word that no one even knows...
Because she no longer owns it…😂😂😂 fuck the royals
I feel like the graphics department purposely drew Jost as a rabbit for the Chipotle joke...
My favorite SNL recurring segment is Che shaking his head to transition to a new setup
https://youtu.be/Km9xUewaKAU 🇷🇺 The collapse of russian economy and even whole country
“So hopefully you remembered to smile” lmaoooooo Gold. These two are always the highlight of the show for me
I have so much to say and I don't know where to begin! All praise and honor to Almighty GOD!   This is a disgust and divine disgrace on all of our behalf. A man who has power to dictate the lives of others is a disaster in the origin of thought itself which our world has came to. Why do we live in Fear? Why are we Puppets? Why do we Believe and based our daily lives and put all of our trust in our faith in the delusional thought that all these individuals that so we are told we put into power actually are working for us? This is far beyond racism, inequality, poverty, wars or cultures! We base our feelings and our views on the things we are feed. Never taking a moment to evaluate before we make a conscious conclusion based upon Facts. Not a possibilities, maybe, or perhaps, just a simple acknowledgement to the actual definition of the word FACT within itself. My GOODNESS how we would all feel a overwhelming presence of BETRAYAL, DECEPTION, AND unaware that we have been vacuous.. WE of all Nationalities have over came, but we've beat the odds. We have all been through trials and tribulations, been manipulated, inslaved, and this is a Fact. We have been puppets for our fore fathers and mothers were too, we all just have been living and doing what all of us have thought was NORMAL. No one is to blame, for if no one told us, if the thrive thrist of pains from the deprivation of soul curiosity. If you wake up, unlearn and relearn. Grow hands and make our history deregarding the fear of the unknown of tomorrow's. We the people can change the ways of our world today. The final battle is here and it is of importance. The slave job can wait, but the distraction of social media is not a priority.. Forgive and hunger for the unseen of what is truly occurring all over the world today!   *https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4635443/  *https://amorebeautifulquestion.com/why-do-kids-ask-so-many-questions-but-more-importantly-why-do-they-stop/  https://nesslabs.com/science-of-curiosity  Hello, somewhere we have all evolved in uncurious beings, unconcerned, self centered, who blame each other for all of the things we are all enduring in some ways or another.
I admit either the International Womens Day joke wasn’t that funny…or I’m tired and don’t get it. What’s the hook?
why did people hate this segment i love it
Did you hear the one about Joe biden?. No. I was watching SNL.
These keep getting funnier
These keep getting funnier and funnier. The chemistry between these two is marvelous. ( can't believe I just typed the word marvelous on a public forum. Twice)
The smile joke was hilarious! I love jokes that go to the edge! 😂😂😂
Remember to smile joke was so good, even Colin had to take a moment and laugh.
the book i need a new butt is a banger.  it's actually quite funny.  there are many sequels to this book as well. check em out.  no ifs ands or butts.
"We have the human heads" Fucking priceless
Michael Che is the best update host of all time, bar none
Weekend Update is the  best part of SNL Colin and Che are the two funniest on the show. SNL is pretty terrible, please keep the one semblance of originality that Michael Che and Colin Jost bring to the show. Don't make the same mistake SNL did with Norm Macdonald just because some people don't understand or appreciate comedy.
Christmas came early with that first joke 😆
They abandon the palace over a year and a half ago you guys are so far behind and even though you're funny you're still on the walk side you're on the left side and you're going to burn in hell unless you were a pimp repent
Just checking in since 1987... Yep, still not funny.    Will check back in another 35 years.
RIP Colin Jost I

What about the international women's day? I didn't get the joke?
If you haven’t read “I Need A New Butt”, please do. It’s hilarious. Or do yourself a favor and watch the youtube vid of a grandma reading it to her grandson and struggling through it for laughing so hard.
Tooth grindr.... Lol
Humor is healing
So we have a crazy scientologist hosting the Oscars? Count me out. Scientology needs to be stopped. The leader of Scientology has made his wife disappear and no one knows where she is!
THE IDINA NAME FLOP REFERENCE?
What happened to SNL, it used to be at least a little funny before 2000. Their writers need to all be replaced, on paper all these jokes bomb.
I don’t get the womens day joke
Why would eating at Chipotle cause a desire to want a new butt? I eat there every day.
Best clip of Weekend Update in a while!
I need a new butt; my old one has a crack in it.
you destroyed snl  forever
They have not been funny last two weeks...THEY are back..these were hysterical..kept laughing, well after...thanks snl writers...you did good! HEY someone must hate restaurants,arbys,cracker barrel,chipolte...lol!!!
I don't get the international women's day joke.  explain please.
“So hopefully you remembered to smile” lmaoooooo Gold. These two are always the highlight of the show for me
Another show scout blaque victimhood?
Michael and Colin started the offensive jokes with their holiday joke swap, but now they're just doing them every week. While it takes away from when they eventually do the joke swap each year, I do enjoy laughing like a psych ward patient when I watch SNL each week.
This show is just awful. Not close to being funny.
😂😂😂😂😂
Who cares?
SNL sucks
Hi buddy l I appreciate your time so you can get your time with your time and it's not sticking around you and it's not sticking around for that to come over and get your number and get your time with your family is doing well and get your number is doing well and get your family is doing well too so you can see what you can do

"Box of human heads stolen from truck." *I have several questions.*
Yesss Denver Here....thanks for the Include, Even if its Because of the Stolen Heads 😍
Watch this hoping for a little chuckle.  Disappointed again.
I like Honkey Barrel too tho
I REEEEALLY want to know the motive behind stealing real severed human heads. The suspense is driving me mad. To fake-claim u killed someone? satanists?  Wannabe Saw guy?
This was by far the best WEEKEND UPDATE these 2 are a great team ✡️✡️✡️✡️
Not to sound like a SNL hater, but this is the best part of the show now days. The rest the shows sketches just aren't funny to me. But these 2 always knock it out of the park
1:27 But more importantly, _why did you fire_ *Brad's Wife?*
NOT  FUNNY
It is flat.
“…the queen Moved out of the palace and moved in with, this is weird, our very own PETE DAVIDSON!”
Wealthy Industrialist Colin Jost the 1st (the first) & Che as a Soldier -  Sweet!
Just in case you haven't heard... God so loved the world He gave His son Jesus that whoever believes in Jesus will have everlasting life. John 3:16 Please believe and repent from your sin today. Eternity in heaven should not be taken lightly, please think about it dont be left behind. Love Y'all
He's not wrong about the cracker barrel lol
I have the I need a new butt book. I read it to my baby but I bought it for me
Swear to god, it seems like they do joke exchange without telling us.
Tooth Grinders! Bahahaha
News Update is the only reason to watch SNL these days.
i love when they made digs at each other
"...Collin Jost the first..."  Damn....nice
I hope you  Remembered to smile got the biggest laugh and I have no idea what  They are talking about
You batted 100 on the smile joke Michael...pure gold!
I say they change the name to cracka barrel. If you don’t pronounce the “er” it’s not racist.
Horrible writing
Umm yeah, one of those trucks that has a box of human heads that we all know exist.
#snl #tom
The gilded age, Arby's, International women's day and urinating on subway jokes were hilarious.😄
2:14 Hey!  THAT'S what Kate was!
There is a river that I used to drive over in VA (I left that crappy state) the sign for the river just said Blacks Run...
Che is too funny🤣🔥
SNL hasn't been funny fo years.  A political arm now.  Crap!  I am sure each of them have a safe space.   Weak men make hard times.
Always the best part of SNL. These two are national treasures.
Passsed away !!!!!
Died!!!!
1:33 - Probably the funniest non-verbal reaction from Michael Che ever 😂🤣
U totally ridiculous hilarious completely ruined my kids!!!!!
This administration is PROTECTED by SNL oh we won't say anything about BRANDON   who SNIFFS AND TOUCHES YOUNG FEMALES ON NATIONAL TV FOR ALL TO SEE. AND VICE PRESIDENT LAUGH ALOT ALL SHE KNOWS HOW TO DO IS LAUGH ALOT 🤣
They always take the cheapest of shots and it’s great!
I'd watch a half hour video of these two, and I have to leave in 20 minutes.
I just ate it Chipotle
Chipotle is s***.  Tried it once. Blew out my colon though. Nasty "food."
Looks like Arby’s is going to be running SNL here pretty soon
i got a joke for SNL writers   What do you call a perfect turd?  ,D a Poo 10 #Putin  #FartJokes #sMileHighCOmedy
I didn't get the International Women's Day "hope you remembered to smile" joke. So.....can someone help me out here?
Che nailed it with the International WOmens day joke.
Still look forward to and love weekend update the best.  HOWEVER,  Loren and NBC, if u dnt want to continue losing viewers then PLEASE turn over the reins of control for that segment to Colin and Michael. They r the best st what they do and the segments with judtthem has become way too short!
Where are all the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris jokes??? Because have you seen them lately... they are a joke!
I'll miss most about not wearing masks is not being told to smile all the time...
https://youtu.be/ec0XKhAHR5I
The Arby’s bit fucking got me 😂😂
I didn't know John Travolta was British
Colin and Michael go together like Peanut Butter and Chocolate.
And people wonder why no one wants to take public transportation
The best part of the program.  Meth users meeting online "tooth grinder"  Dental joke, what do you get when you have 32 meth heads in one room?  A complete set of teeth
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤
Cracker Barrel 😂
That gilded age joke!
The Arby's joke was very disturbing. And still funny.
Lol...the fact that they used the Arby's logo means they actually got the company to sign off on that human head joke 🤣🤣🤣 just amazing
Another week of SNL ignoring Joe Biden shitting his pants every 5 minutes.
I here you....uh..uh..
These two guys are the funniest part of SNL.  Wish their segment was a little longer.
The weekend updated better never be cancelled 😂😂😂
Put Pete Davidson back on Weekend Update.
Best part of the show…
man that Arby's joke was funny, makes me wanna go out and grab a couple beef and cheddars for dinner
Omfg how I'm *just* truly realizing the name of Cracker Barrel 👀😬
I love when chipotle is the butt of Jost jokes 😀
I support homeless urination in public, since the public is sadistic capitalist pigs
Weekend update is my favorite part of the show. I also miss Black jeopardy hosted by Keenan aka Darnell
Seeing how John Mayer is smiling in the picture, the Queen can be The One.
Turns out they got it wrong, it's 'John Major', the Queen is shacking up with.
I don't get the John Mayer joke. Someone explain it please.
Loved the "Cracker Barrel" comment ! These guys are always better than the weekly host !
Che 😁
Tooth grinder.
I never get tired of watching these two both present the news hilariously and trying to make each other laugh. It's both hilarious and informative!
We should have comments for ads.
Every single day is women's day and also assholles' day, go for  meth offline
Weekend update is the best thing about SNL
One of the things I love about Che and Colin's chemistry is whenever Che rags on Colin, Colin's initial reaction is hilarious!
New York City is about to have a new inhabitant, Christmas Island rat.
"We have the human heads." HAHAHA!
Critical Race Theory was banned so “I Need A New Butt” could fly!
That look Colin has on his face after the Gilded Age joke. 🤣🤣
“Tooth Grindr” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
no but WHY was there a box of human heads? …under what circumstance…
There was a broad of possible content for the meth user online joke: "but they had trouble getting online, trying to find computer bugs in the walls"
That was a good opening burn right there
Its like Buckingham is two words when yanks say it, lol. Bucking. Ham. Hahaha
I didn't get the "remember to smile" joke.  What was that supposed to mean?
I love Che's approval on the cracker barrel joke.
Let's Go Brandon!  💩🍆
I believe it is pronounced Bucking-um.
Was this a joke swap and you guys just forgot to tell us? 😂😂😂
Colin face lmfaoo
Time for a change. This isn't funny anymore. To me Che wasn't funny in the first place.
Jost got roasted, & didn't seem pleased... just a thought 🤷‍♂️
The heejabs and burkas didn’t celebrate.
Man that international women’s day joke was spot on tho 😆😆😆😆😆😆
Just when you thought ALL blacks was former slaves when the truth is whites came here as slaves. They found blacks here then in 1856 Lewis & Clark found the Mongolian Indians in their push out west. Hundreds of years of Indian Wars was with the so-called African Americans aka American Indians
No painted angry citizens wearing bullhorns storming the doors though. Good luck in  2024!
Jussie Smolet is funnier than this
I feel stupid--I didn't get the International Women's Day joke. Please explain.
Oddly enough, I just went to Cracker Barrel yesterday and that shit was delicious!! Lol.
Cracker barrel 🤣
Chipotle doesn't offer spicy foods!
Can someone explain the ”remember to smile” joke?
You guys are the best lololol
Buk ing um pall iss
Very funny, except I didn’t get the International women’s Day. So I should remember to smile joke.  All other ones were great especially the Queen moving in with John Mayer joke, I need a new butt joke we’re my fave’s.
Is it inappropriate to ask, what's that racial slur :)?
Damn you ,smile I'm smiling on the inside 😐. . 😂😂😂
Tried watching the show last night. Absolutely unwatchable. The commercials are easier to sit through. The music saved the show. She was funniest thing of the night. Bienvenida
Toothbrush 😁😁😁
In modern SNL, this is the only segment with funny writers
I love the Idina Menzel/Adele Dazeem joke! 🤣
I can't wait to see Colin's hair. Yes, he's talented but come on his hair is important...❤
Che... Bruh...No...
Hey ! I lived in Queens  N.Y. 🤣
I knew Che would have a savage women's day joke lol
When these two hit the spot, they really hit it. 🤣🤣 women's rights... haha pls.
Michael Che with a leadoff home run 🤣🤣🤣
Don't really care for SNL that much but holy hell this was sooo good lmao
ummm.....thanks for the "clapter"
I'm sure SNL is hilarious to Americans, but it just doesn't travel well.
Yeah,sounds'bout hwyte; jost4new trump mouth piece,actually...
Is it me, or is this getting meaner and funnnier?
There's already an article out criticizing the quality of Weekend Update over the last few weeks.
Cracker Barrel lol
Chance would be a fine thing for H.M. The Queen to move out of Buckingham Palace considering that she doesn't live there anyway.  She either lives at Windsor Castle, Sandringham, Balmoral Castle or any of her other properties.  In fact it's common knowledge that she hates living in Buckingham Palace and she only goes there to perform ceremonial duties if it's unavoidable and she has to.  Those duties usually involve greeting foreign Heads of State and holding banquets etc, things like investitures she usually leaves up to other senior members of the Royal Family especially Prince Charles and Prince William.  Prince Andrew on the other hand isn't permitted to get involved in any Royal duties - well, not so much 'permitted' as he'd find it pretty difficult for him to perform those considering that he's been bricked up in the cellar for the past month or so since he 'settled' his court case, hasn't he?
Michael completely nailed John Travolta's oddly articulate way of speaking these days... and mispronouncing names.
If Pete wasn't dating KK then they would've made a joke about her "work hard" interview.
FAKE FOX NEWS IS PRO RUSSIAN, SEAN HANNITY AND TUCKER CARLSON ARE TRAITORS
Freakin' Cracker Barrell... You made it come out of my nose...
You know, I braced myself for what Che was going to say about Woman's Day...but that's like bracing when you're about to be hit by a truck. Doesn't do much to dull the impact. Wow. 😆
black rock and Vanguard own society   Media. Politics. Learning institutions. Corporate conglomerates. Banking. Pharmaceutical. Military industrial complex . Oil companies. Food. Housing market etc   They are playing different sides of the same thing. It is one thing that owns industry and institutions like a giant monopoly and then plays us like dumb pawns.   This is all being done on purpose.   Trump is the same thing as biden.   People don't understand this. 🙄  And no one even know what owns Vanguard  it is private information.   After seeing enough patterns thru out history globaally. I seriously think it just might be something not even human because something has redacted and muddied up our collective information since the bronze age.   Talk about misinformation 🦎👽🥒💦🤷‍♀️  Humans need to be kinder and more aware ✌💫
I know there is a preshow, but are some of the jokes not shown until air? Colin and Che seem like some times they’ve never seen the joke and that’s why they’re laughing
Look 0 comment can't see shit and not allowed to comment unless fixed
“So hopefully you remembered to smile” lmaoooooo Gold. These two are always the highlight of the show for me😂😂
This was awesome
The womens day joke was amazing!
lmao the international women's day joke slayed
I sent that book to my niece and nephew. It's sooo funny
Who is getting paid to write this dumb shit???
I don't get the joke about Int'l Women's Day and hope you remembered to smile..
*breaking news...* sea levels are causing concern in great britian as sewers continue to back up... the queen... now taking the sensible precaution...
That John Mayer joke would have been better if it was Pete Davidson.
Can someone explain the Women's Day joke to me? Went over my head
The international women’s day joke made no sense.
I love SNL, but these guys are the highlight of the show
Mississippi be like: How dare you teach our kids to read!
Great! Now I have to watch eight heads in a duffle bag movie.
Right off the bat with the Colin joke 🤌
"Until they were driven out by wealthy industrialist Colin Just the First". Love it when these 2 make jokes about each other
Colin Jost the 1st  . 😅
Im going to sound like an idiot but I didnt get the Int' Women's Day joke. Can someone clarify?
Seriously “Or Not.”  We have enough rats
This was excellent. Seems a little bolder
whats in it for the rat lol
The international women’s day joke lol
As a woman, I would have to say the international woman’s day joke was spot on. I hope SNL repots the other part they removed 😱😍
Jost: "So we change those names but they can still just call a restaurant, 'Cracker Barrel." Che: **knowingly points and smiles**
That international woman's day literally ruined Colin Moriarty's career.
Queen Elizabeth is moving out just in time to be Pete Davidson’s next hook-up. Get it, queenie 🥰 👑
censorship  they deleting all the videos......?watch them quick///
This audience was juiced.  The laughter doesn't match the jokes.
Why did this feel like a Joke Swap segment even though it wasn't 😂😂
The first part of weekend update is set to private?
1:32 Love Che's gesture of Black solidarity with Colin's Cracker Barrel joke. 👉🏾
If The Queen is moving out of Buckingham Palace, then I guess that means Yul Brenner can finally move into it. Shout out to anyone who gets this reference.
We have the human heads...and every part of the pig, save the squeal
