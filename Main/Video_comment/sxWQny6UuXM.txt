🌍Record Cold -86F in Antarctica Today as liberal bias news continue to push climate warming baloney. California is on “Fire” 🔥because of poor forest management, carelessness and utility wiring that is faulty throughout the state.

California should be ashamed of themselves they pushed the most environmental strict laws on the rest of the United States however they break the laws all these fires got to stop and quit putting the rest of America. Enough is enough

A go fund me set up to help the victims of the fires #PrayforCali https://www.gofundme.com/f/helpiscomingcali
We should have herds of goats eating down all the weeds that help fuel the fires!   They are doing it in other states and countries!
I heard about the fire and i cried alot today and i am praying
Idaho is looking good.....
Hi Michelle S ....
All the time time california only wildfire's  ( ? )
OH NOES! Mrbeast is there
I think its better to cut off all tresses surrounding in that area because all dried falling leaves are trigger of fire..
That takes some guts to light a back fire to save animals.  Have to know what you are doing,  great work there. Heros.
If people would take some time to pray God will send some rain to put these fires out
*If you notice that before California wildfire started August 9 2018 until new California wildfire began almost exactly same as before.*
IN God We Trust!!!!!!!!!!!!!!+++++++++++
Stay safe! Everyone! From Ph🇵🇭❤🇺🇸
My prayers are with all God bless you all and keep God in your life because of this time you need him more than ever praise His name that you're even still alive amen
This is so sad
May the tears of god come in the form of rain to rescue them. Om mani padme hum .
I hate to tell you california is broke and getting more broke every minute.it's up in flames because of liberals started these fires long ago.

Sucks to live in California
As a native Calif for over 50 years, people REFUSE to thin the brush. This happens every year. Sorry folks.
California was fine until the fire nation invaded
I’ve been hearing nothing about these this year. And I’m afraid it’s because it’s the new normal. They shut off people’s power and this still happens.  The climate crisis is here.

2020 : Hello There!
our world is dying so badly this year ..
I'm right by the Jones fire and they're told us to stay inside the smoke it so bad and my dad's friends were told they need to be prepared to loose their houses and ppl have had to evacuate bc of the smoke my dad's friends had to let his livestock out so they wouldn't get hurt
Dose this happen every year now?
That man's hands are panicing!
Lol
News news NEWS *NEWS* News news.  Why?  Well we just told you.

God is angry
these fires are so bad and at such a bad time :(
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 Everyone out there..... Be safe...
After these past couple years, I've come to the conclusion that God is trying to tell California something.
Maybe gavin will use that money he didnt withhold from himself and donate it to firefighters?
Why is Cali always on fire?
I hope everyone is getting out of there safely same goes for those poor animals in forest
God bless yall
This is climate change
California's liberal policies over the years seem to cause all creation to travail, like most west coast states.  God mercy and grace last so long... we may be seeing the beginning of sorrows as the Bible talks about.   It seem the more liberal America has gotten and anti biblical laws are causing all creation to cry out.   I pray for God's mercy...
I go on this area of the freeway all the time
My cousin told me about the fires she showed me she’s in California
Am I surprised? No
That hurt remains, the image about themselves that they’ve invested into. Is it possible not to have any images at all, why do we become, that means escaping from what is?
I heard al Qaeda done this with stolen planes.. jet fuel melts steel beams, why not grass?!
California needs burned every once in a while..

Very strange voice. Sounds like something is in his mouth.
Strange that no one wears a respirator in such deadly smoke conditions that are not good for lungs or heart.
Bye guyz
I would take heed and start serving God, repent from your evil ways and go back to God!!! Pray and God will heal the land after you turn from your wicked ways!!!!!
Ashes and smoke all over Sacramento

First Lebanon, now new fires in California. Welp that’s another month that lost hope
10,000 lighting strikes dont tell me its not God's Judgement
Hopefully this can get all under control but how long has these wildfires been going on
Eh well just another day in 2020
HALLELUJAH! What a MERCIFUL SAVIOUR! The lightning came to accomplish a strategic MISSION! NOT death, though SURELY MANY could have died! NO! The LORD is Returning SOON and He is trying to get the  ATTENTION of His precious people! Many  have been made uncomfortable, and sick with virus etc, but the REPENTANCE that's needed is not yet coming.  The LORD is STILL saying; "If My people, which are called by My name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from Heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land." 2 Chronicles 7:14! SOME ACTUALLY don't believe that judgment is in the land! They have the attitude...What have I done? REPENT! All we have is time to live for JESUS!  Love GOD and love His people to be ready to go back with JESUS when He returns. If you don't honor and love JESUS while you're alive, HE will NOT know you after you've died. "I never knew you:"...KJV
World : The end
This might sound insane but I dreamed of this..... driving and out of no where I was surrounded by fire 😰

What is going on in the world? First the corona virus. Now this
I live in South Bay, in Los Gatos. I can see the Vacaville fire's smoke over the mountains. I wish I could go to temp shelter and bring them some food and sweets, but I've lost so much money because of Covid. The only thing I can offer are my prayers
I live in Sacramento, and oh my,I’m scared

It’s so sad, especially because of the timing. It’s very hard to have an evacuation center cause of corona
Jesus stay safe everyone and thank you firefighters for risking their lives for us.
Be careful. Stay safe everyone.

In the beginning, God created heaven and earth. The earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. God saw that the light was good and he divided the darkness from the light.  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was nothing made that was made. In him was life and the life was the light of men. And the light shined in the darkness and the darkness comprehended it not.   There was a man sent from God to bear witness of that light. That true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. The true light came to his own and his own received him not, but to as many as would receive him, to them, gave he power to become the sons of God, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of man, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God.  And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among men and they beheld the Word of life, that true bread which came down from heaven wherein lies everlasting life.  “Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭8:12‬ ‭KJV‬‬  “And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.” ‭‭John‬ ‭17:3‬ ‭KJV‬‬
My friend's daughter was so upset about skipping school because of these fires praying for everyone who's been affected by this 🙏
I thought this was fake cuz he said tonight so many times
California is probably the worst place to be right now.
But why wait till the fires start to implement controlled burns🤔
Even here in stockton the sky is ogre  green and tiny ashes are in the sky since a few days ago! Its so sad this year has been bad since the start.
Another reason to wear a mask, our thoughts are with those affected and the firefighters.
The Red Dots represent all the pedos in that neighborhood 😆

16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3:16-18  Jesus Christ is the only way.

Tips: cut down grass, trees and bushes. Dig around your house or around the fire to make a somewhat wet soil. Make sure you’re gutters are free of leaves. Mow around your house or around fires. And Keep soil wet
Please rain California!!!!
These fires are no joke😷....please stay safe everyone🙏🏾🙏🏾
If everyone that has faith in God says a prayer. It will help with millions of voice at once God will listen. 🙏
These Fires are not caused by Lighting, those that believe in that are BLIND.......Be Honest to the American people"
Keep safe.
It's truly sad what is going on in California. I hope everyone and animals are helped out of the path!  Unfortunately when you take God out of your life then God sees no reason to force himself to help you.
Prayers for California 🙏 👩‍🚒🧑🏻‍🚒👨🏻‍🚒 #wildfires
Praying 🙏 for California may God watch over you ALL animals and people. Peace in abundance
Continue know God living in your heart to Billy Graham.  Peace With God
Praying for all. This is a wake up call.     It's not Mother Nature.  God is allowing these lightning fires to happen.  Because we sin and fall short of the Glory of God.  God loves you and wants a Personal relationship with God not a Religion.

And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.  “This, then, is how you should pray:  “‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.  For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.  Matthew 5-7 NIV "The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God."  In the New Heaven and New Earth, only Righteousness dwells. May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with all.
Christians States of AmericaAnd Jesus said to them in answer, Take care that you are not tricked.  For people will come in my name, saying, I am the Christ; and a number will be turned from the true way through them And news will come to you of wars and talk of wars: do not be troubled, for these things have to be; but it is still not the end For nation will be moved against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and men will be without food, and the earth will be shaking in different places But all these things are the first of the troubles Then they will be cruel to you,  and will put you to death: and you will be hated by all nations because of my name. And numbers of people will be turned from the right way, and will give one another up and have hate for one another And a number of false prophets will come, causing error And because wrongdoing will be increased, the love of most people will become cold But he who goes through to the end will get salvation And this good news of the  kingdom will be given through all the world for a witness to all nations; and then the end will come. When, then, you see in the holy place the unclean thing which makes destruction, of which word was given by Daniel the prophet  (let this be clear to the reader)Then let those who are in Judaea go in flight to the mountains: Let not him who is on the house-top go down to take anything out of his house:  And let not him who is in the field go back to get his coat But it will be hard for women who are with child and for  those with babies at the breast in those days.And say a prayer that your flight may not be in the winter, or on a Sabbath. Because in those days there will be great sorrow, such as there has not been from the start of the world till now, or ever will be. And if those days had not been made short there would have been no salvation for any, but because of the saints those days will be made short. Then if any man says to you, See, here is the Christ, or, Here; do not put faith in him; For there will come up false Christs,  and false prophets, who will do great signs and wonders; so that if possible even the saints might be tricked. See, I have made it  clear to you before it comes about. If, then, they say to you, See, he is in the waste land; go not out: See, he is in the inner rooms;  put no faith in it Because as in a thunderstorm the bright light coming from the east is seen even in the west;  so will be the coming of the Son of man. Wherever the dead body is, there will the eagles come together But straight away,  after the trouble of those days, the sun will be made dark and the moon will not give her light and the stars will come down  from heaven and the powers of heaven will be moved: And then the sign of the Son of man will be seen in heaven: and then all  the nations of the earth will have sorrow, and they will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out his angels with a great sound of a horn, and they will get his saints together from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. Now take an example from the fig-tree: when her branch has become soft and puts out its leaves,  you are certain that the summer is near; Even so, when you see all these things, you may be certain that he is near, even at the  doors Truly I say to you, This generation will not come to an end till all these things are complete. Heaven and earth will come to an end, but my words will not come to an end. But of that day and hour no one has knowledge, not even the angels in heaven, or the Son, but the Father only. And as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of man. Because as in those days before the overflowing of the waters, they were feasting and  taking wives and getting married, till the day when Noah went into the ark, And they had no care till the waters came and took them all away; so will be the coming of the Son of man Then two men will be in the field; one is taken, and one let go; Two women will be crushing grain; one is taken, and one let go Amen

#ThanksALotTrump
Follow Pelosi, Feinstein, Waters and Newsom like Lemmings.  They will stop at the cliff and pat all you libtrads on the back as you jump off the cliffs into the ocean.....  We in the "real" Northern CA (meaning north of Chico) will not follow them, but the rest of CA can follow them and see what has happened....  The Democrats are destroying this state and they blame it on Trump!!!  Wake up voters and see what defunding the police and firefighters will do to your communities.....  Vote Newsom OUT....  Put Pelosi in the freezer with all her ice cream!  Toss Feinstein and Waters off the cliff to test the depth of the ocean.
My name is Lucifer, And I'm saddened by all the fires, I love all living creatures, and a lot of them are suffering right now.  If you live near the fires and you are able to safely help, please do! Rescue and save as many animals as you can! x

Who keep setting all these wildfires? ??
Kinda makes ya wonder how all these fires got started?
This is why you clear your dead grass and trees... some just don’t know.
Why aren't Fire Dept’s From All Over, Other State's Firefighters, Helping Fight These Fires, Immediately! Is The Gov't Waiting For A Repetition of Last Year?
Happy the animals are safe let’s keep them safe. All lives matter even animals
What a nice guys!!! Hope they be safe!
Remember this!  For fifty years the environmentalist sued to stop the state forest service from managing the forest to prevent fires like this! Environmentalists stopped any harvesting or brush cutting, or undergrowth removal to prevent firs. Anytime some company or even the National Forest service wanted to build roads for access, or thin out the timber to prevent fires the Hollywood financed environmentalist sued in courts to stop it. Radical spiked trees made up false stories about animal preservation, and the Mainstream news and Democrats were all in 100 percent with the environmentalist. Like Democrats do not care about aborting innocent babies environmentalists do not care how many homes are burned and how many lives are destroyed!
California's just Burning down every where..too sad...

Whoever reads this God bless, come to Know Jesus of Nazareth, We have fallen short of Gods glory and, Jesus came and took our place on the cross...what we have to do it repent and trust in His goodness and mercy, and by faith alone...surrender for a true new life in Christ...He who endures to the end shall be saved •The gospel⬇️ https://youtu.be/n5ZtlzxlDig •Watch a poem "THE GREAT I AM"⬇️ https://youtu.be/bYTypUb_Jc4

I think they're leaving the chickens because they're going to swing back by later and eat them 😆
I want you to know that you are amazing and you are so loved. Whether you know it or not it is true that you have a Father in heaven who loves you so much, that He gave His only son to take your place on the cross so that you might know Jesus Christ and believe in Him so that you may have everlasting life.(John 3:16) If you are still reading this, I want you to know that Jesus is the answer to that emptiness that you have been feeling and it is true that Jesus wants a personal relationship with you. If you admit you are a sinner (WE ALL SIN!), Believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross to pay the debt for all your sins, was buried and on the third day, God rose Him from the dead. YOU ARE SAVED! "If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved." (Romans 10:9) P.S. JESUS IS COMING BACK!
I hope everyone is safe. Our air quality has been deemed "worst air quality in the world"

Didn't they tell us this would happen in the grammy's performance and even billie eillish music video?  Weird its like their producers knew it was gonna happen
🖕🏽2020
2020:  Weirdest year ever!
When CDF went from having scattered small fire stations to fast attack on small fires and went to the "CALFIRE" model of allowing the fire to grow so they can bring in the large aircraft to try stopping the fires that should have been stopped when small.
Lightening seems to be the theme in all these fires... MILITARY DEW IS MORE LIKE IT!!
Are there some in SoCal?
Total poor coverage
I wouldn’t be surprised if BLMers started the fires considering the demographics of the home owners in the fire zones.
I'm just home from the hospital and to my father I can only say thank you I love you you made the day thank you

PERO CUANTO SE LES HA DICHO A LOS CALIFORNIANOS QUE DEJEN TODO TIPO DE HOMOSEXUALISMO, Y LESVIANIZMO, Y NO HAN QUERIDO OBEDECER, LES DIJE QUE ÉSE ABOMINABL PECADO SOLAMENTE ES QUEMADO CON FUEGO6,ES BIBLICO, PORFAVOR HAGAN OIDOS ABIERTOS A LO QUE NUESTRO SEÑOR JESUCRISTO LES MANDA A DECIR, ESTO ES REAL, NO ES CUANTO DE VIEJAS, LO QUE VIENE ES BIEN GRANDE DICE NUESTRO SEÑOR JESUCRISTO.
WOW! What on earth could have the Caucasian people have done to cause all of this to happen to them, cause I know there are no people of color who's homes are getting destroyed by fire...😏 The Native Indians aren't complaining neither, I wonder why😏Oh because they've killed them and stole their land's..
