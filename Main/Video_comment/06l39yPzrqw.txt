Watching this video after watching the Bike trip, i knew what the hints were about but it is still fun to watch! 😂
Watching Kara singing at the concert made me cry❤
You should come to clarksville Tennessee sunday
I live in Illinois❤
Does sarah and dusty have a flex working to be able join you on so many things some been short notice
OH, Kara.  I cried happy tears for you when you cried.  Please stay happy for all of the life surprises you have ahead of you.  Some will be hard and others a cake walk but on a smile on your face and love in your heart that glows in your life will make both even more meaningful.  Remember, we face life trials to make us stronger.  Just go head on like you always do girl.
Why am I watching this after the tandem bike across american
You guys have shown me what a healthy relationship should look like, and what support for one another can do for your happiness. I now come to your channel for comfort and to feel happy and remind myself to not accept less, ever ❤❤❤
Kara belting out Adele while Nate has his AirPods in 😂
How much power did you end up using for the heater?  Great camping spot😁
Nate ran the Leadville 100
I live on missouri at 9:42
Wow...❤ you guys! This road trip was so fun to watch. Watching Kara drive and bla st out Adele ..like I would was so memorable. Thanks for this 🎉❤😊😊😊
For future reference Caesars has oversized parking
I would be excited to see Adele too! Kara's joy is infectious.
They really are the best pancakes out there, for sure.
Nate: “this was supposed to just be a simple project before bed” me remembering helping my dad install the gate latch for the pool and saying that nothing can just be a simple project
I love how excited Kara was for the Adele concert made me so happy
Just now seeing your video.  Kara, I am so jealous of you seeing Adele.  I love her too.  Susie
Seeing Kara’s excitement for the Adele concert made my day slay 😂😂😂😂
You do know that Adele is in Europe this summer…. You know…. If you would happen to be close you might as well 😂😂
*Looks up Adele ticket prices* Ok, Nate is officially not cheap anymore :D
You came to my town, Oceanside!! Looking forward to why!!!
Be careful because I was driving down I70 once and a mountain goat rolled down the mountain and almost hit my car 😮
I love how Kara is so excited about seeing Adele
You have us all sending you positive vibes lifting you up as you figure out where this takes you. We'll be here cheering you on no matter what ❤
still escy to hack pass a vpn  thay is a back door to all vpns thay dont help for noting its a scame
Are you guys tandem being across the US
so did you get the drawer on the right track and how did you get the camra
Do you ever consider to buy a rv like ekko?
This should be in the van life playlist. I almost missed it
I remember eating at the Circus Circus back in 1969 right before we moved to Vegas from a small town in CA. I had been back several times after that as I grew up. Love videos about Vegas. Wish you'd had showed more of Vegas. But thanks.😊
people who already know what the adventure is bc you have already seen all of the other videos about the adventure 👇
people who didn't know that they lived in Nashville Tennessee! 👇
You guys are great.
I loooooooooooove your videos!
Yay van life!!!!!!
I live in AZ
More van life
I threw up bc the pipe thing that clogged it
Kara did you rol your eyes when nate was talking about the cannion
I watched you combined vlog of this adventure., It sure was epic
I wonder if @adele has seen this? I'm sure that she would love it.
Seeing Kara get so exited to see Adele made me tear up.. let me not lie 🩷🙂
I did that same drive with 3 kids under 7, that was not as fun as urs looked
At 25:00 there was a bad word ...... but love ya'all ❤️
I wished she met Adel in person and gived her a big hug
I am totally in love with Kara and Nate! Also (just a random question) ;) maybe someone have an idea what is the top blue top Kara is wearing in this video?) just everytime it looks suuuper good! thanks
I think Kara and Nate would be amazing parents
I'm rewatching and to add in the state motto that wasn't mentioned.... I'm from Kansas, the sunflower state! Yes, I miss you guys and am now going back through the catalog. I don't mind this year looking different, I like watching any of your videos. I'll watch new ones when they come and old ones when I need to. <3 Alexandra
Do Sarah and dusty have a YouTube
Damn, considering those tickets are pretty much $1000+ per person on a Saturday night, lucky girl!
These "points" are fake.
They have created themselves from a fake credit account.
They do nothing of importance. They literally travel on fake credit.
They NEVER do ANYTHING that helps local people. Nothing at all Why?
Liars and deceivers. Nothing for anyone in their hometowns. NOTHING.
When are you two from Tennessee actually going to talk to all the people. I can guess why you DON'T, but you two are scared you will lose MONEY. Because they support America, and that is not going to give you money. Shame on YOU!
What have you done for Tennessee? Zero.
You will never care, because you don't.
Have you guys gone back to Tennessee? Because it is obvious you have not. Why Travel all over the world and not do anything for your home towns?
please add the subtitle.
This video felt like it was five hours😂
Love you guys - but the amount of ads on your channel is excessive
I was also doing an RV trip last year and got last minute tickets to see Adele!! Got tickets one hour before showtime and it was SO worth it - however we didn't stay at Circus Circus with the RV since it was fully booked- tbh, I'm kinda happy about it, seeing how disappointing it is. Loved Kara's reaction! Adele is worth EVERY penny - Kara, what about a trip to Germany this year to see Adele in Munich?! 👀
OH MY GOD I MISSED THIS EPISODE AND SAW THE LIFE UPDATE 2024, YOU MENTIONED ADELE AND I'M THE BIGGEST ADELE FAN AND THE BIGGEST K&N FANS, BEST CROSSOVER OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME
Seeing Kara's reaction to Adele is special.
My sister lived in oceanside it was my first experience in California. I took the same route there that yall did! (Wrecked in Utah though ugh).
I love how Kara is so happy when she saw Adele
I wish i was cool enough for yall to stop by where me and my family is at!! love the videos!! keep up the good work and be safe!!
Literally got shivers! Its my dream to see her in person! 25:45
Looks like you two will have a great time as usual. You both amazed me. Safe travels.
I love ur vids
Video idea  go to minesota
So glad you got to see Adele, she cancelled on us the day we were on route to London to see her, gutted didn’t come close.
I'm so jealous 🎉❤
I love watching ur vid Kara and nate there awsomw!! You guys make me want to travel even more then i want to already. I love to watch you guys! Alot of the time I'll watch you guys at night and make bracelets idek why😂 But love you guys
So, as soon as you mentioned pancakes, I went downstairs to look for my mix, but it was nowhere to be found. So I decided pancakes were worth it, and I made my own from scratch! They were the best pancakes I have had in a long time! Thanks Nate!!! ❤ Also, wow on the new journey. It’s been a while since I’ve seen your show but I still think you’re awesome. Please forgive the spam likes. I’ve already seen those episodes. Just wanted to like them. You’re passing mighty close to where I live Boise, Idaho. Well kind of I might be a few hundred miles off!!😂😂
Imagine life without having found Kara and Nate..imagine if they didn’t pick up a camera. The world wouldn’t be the same!
11:42  Uuuu that was so sweet !😄
3:30   eeewwww😶
I've been binge watching u for a month now and thnx for helping find more fab peeps. And just throwing it out there if u have any single guy friends that needs a companion hook a sister up!!! Lol but seriously yall are so great and u never forget to stay humble and thank God for the life yall have been blessed with. It's been my dream for the past 8 years but with my health doing alone is impossible.  But I wish I could. Stay safe, be careful, luv each other and last but never least never go to sleep before settling an argument or differences of opinions. !💋
I'm surprised by how little you vlogged on this trip to CA!
NevAHduh. AHHH AS IN APPLE!!! 😂
Love you guys!  However, I’ve gotta take a little bit of miff with your constant diss on my beloved Missouri and its motto “the show me state”! 😉  You’ve got to do more than drive through on I70!!  It’s a great state, beautiful, especially in the Ozarks.  I know you loved the Katy Trail, you need to do the whole thing!  Come back and stay awhile!
he just left the cardboard there i'm not sure he pick that up because that is pollution no offence.
This was so beautiful ❤ 🥲🥲🥲 I teared up with Karas excitement and how sweet you were Nate being so happy in her joy! ❤❤❤
Kara’s experience with Adele was exactly the way I was when I saw Celine Dion at The Collosseum. Cried straight through the first two songs and sat in the same area y’all did 😂
Is that your kid??
I am so happy y'all are back in the van! I love love love your vanlife videos. I would love to see you travel internationally in the van. Maybe Europe? or Africa?  That would be so awesome!
I love this so much i missed the van!!
I live 45 min away from hays ks
totally random but i still remember staying over at Circus Circus hotel (the one with the RV parking) years ago when i visited Vegas! (kinda crazy night because they checked us in into a room that had someone's belongings in it LOL!)
It’s so funny how when Kara is just having such a calm nice morning and on the other hand Nate is on top of some mountains 😂😂😂😂😂 17:15
Just buy another shower hose to increase it's length. Also, you should have just adjusted your roof platform, then you wouldn't have a problem.
I am now going to put my cardboard trash to use and start using it for to do lists! 📦💡
What is with so much hate on the show me state. Y’all need to spend more time in the state it has some really hidden gems. Just saying 😂
Fav people!
I don’t think I’ll ever get sick of watching your videos I even got my fiancé to start watching… I’ll be eating and watching )my fav thing to do) and he’s like where are they??And boom he’s hooked 😂🤌🏼💜
Colorado is the Centennial State because we were admitted into the Union in 1876.
The Badlands in South Dakota was the most beautiful landscape I have seen in person.  I highly suggest it.
You're not in Kansas if you see Missouri Tigers merch in Wal-Mart!  Big rivalry!  My wife and I went to the University of Missouri in Columbia MO, home of the Tigers.  The name came from a local Civil War militia.  Joke: When Mizzou plays LSU, the Tigers will probably win (they are both named Tigers).
"10 million Kroger bags" 😂😂
Oohhh and the concert🥰 gave me chills! Love y'all💜 Lots of Love from NC🤗✌🏼💜
I'm only 12:49 minutes into this video, and wow! I just love the feeling I'm getting from the peaceful music and the calming scenery🥰 I thought it was beautiful💜 lots of Love from NC🤗✌🏼💜
The Circus Circus is the hottest campsite I've ever been to!  When you take a shower and go back to the RV, you'll be sweating again!
Have you ever seen Dances with Wolves!  You were in the area of Fort Hays, (a nice historical area!) where Kevin Costner’s character received his orders to go to South Dakota!
I love all your adventures, but there is something so special about your van life series. I just ❤ these so much!
I cheated I know without the the hints cause I have already seen the the first two episodes of the RAAM series. Comiserations Nate about Adele that is, or maybe you like her through Kara.
You should come to Missouri and then avilla
YESSS VAN LIFE IS BACK!
the difference  of Colorado is "The color red is rojo. Colorado is "colored", but it more has the meaning of "colored red" as in flush colored or "colored" as in a dirty joke as the dictionary says. In English we say my face is "red" when we're embarassed or astonished, but "color" is also used to denote skin pigmentation in general." I looked it up because I live in Coloredo. hope you guy are doing well.    :  ]
I would really want to look at Sarah & dusty’s and Rick’s family van!
that was so cute istg
😮 Looks like you sat next to Nate Bargatze at the concert.
Are you guys planing on going to WI?
NATE I WAS EATING BROOO WHYYYY 😭😭🫥🧍🏽
24:09 is so FUNNNY!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
But HAVE you stopped in Lawrence, Kansas? You two would love it!
Kara's excitement is contagious. Great to see you both back in the van. Loving it.👍😊🇮🇪🇺🇸
What was name of camp ground in Vegas.?
They’re getting a dog
Again, Nate, you're the best husband ever!  Coffee in bed every day is just unbelievable!
so there van is considered oversize how ever when they pull out from the parking spot theres a big RV camper????
Omg hello from golden Colorado, if you guys come thru need some local hydration mix called acclimate it helps you acclimate to the altitude, and drink more 😉👋🏻💦🤗
You shipped pieces to Colorado that you could have bought at your first stop Lowes😅
I am afraid the video will be flagged because you recorded parts of the concert. I am surprised that it hasn't been flagged yet, so perhaps you get away with it too.
Making the love of your life happy is priceless, it doesn't matter if it's tickets or a room, as long as their happy. That's all that matters.
PLEASE COME TO SOUTH AFRICA
Got to admit, while I enjoy your adventures around the world, I love your van life and USA videos. We had visited twice (from Australia) when Covid-19 hit... During the intervening two years of being locked into our State (WA opened their borders in April 2022) we planned another three or four trips, helped in part by your videos. We've now returned twice more, have the next trip booked, and think there will probably be at least another two on the horizon.
Kara's invigorating energy is so contagious! I LOVE IT
I had to look up Hay’s State University. Figured it would not be the case that a town in Kansas was that obsessed with LSU.
I think you two should meet up with @NomadicMovement You all are coffee LOVERS!!! That would make a great video!!
0:20 has bad thing
The “I did it” after Nate finished installing the solar sent me 😂😂 hahaha
You guys are the best youtubers! I always watch your videos! I know you probably won’t see this but you guys are awesome! Adele! 😂
Im so happy to be back as a viewer! I missed your van life!!
I'm soooo happy y'all are doing van life again!!
Kara joy in this video is so great :)
Adele is so overrated 🙄
What an awesome video. I had a smile on my face the whole time. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 can’t wait to watch the next show 🙏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
So happy for you guys ❤❤
I don’t even watch YouTubers videos it it’s entirety, I just open up the video and click thumbs down because YouTubers talk as if the world revolves around them and also YouTubers talk as if YouTubers are better than everyone. The world doesn’t revolve around YouTubers and no person is better than anyone.
As a follower of your channel from Hays, Ks- welcome! ❤❤
I think you guys must be crazy! But I found out this summer that my two grandsons, age 8 and 10 watch your videos, and they are both bike riders since they were babies, love mountain biking, etc, so I know they will be following your journey and loving it! Best of luck to all of you! 💞💞🚴🚴‍♂🚴‍♀💞💞
Hey! Colorado girl here. Seeing your love for the mountains have you considered the TMB? I have mentioned it before. But it’s a 110 mile, 35,000 foot elevation gain thru hike. Averages about 10 days. We have it all planned for next summer. You should look into it but book now! It’s already hard to find Refugio’s! We go the end of June before crowds hit.
sosooooooo in love with ADELE tooo 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Awww Missouri! You totally could have stayed at my house ! Love ya guys ❤
😂 I camped in the Vegas campground on the strip way back when I was in elementary school. Hasn't changed much in 35 years!
Love your van adventures best! Looking forward to many more :)
Yessss I have been ready for another adventure video
Adele is a bloody treasure! Did you see that video of her styling on some pesky security for harassing a fan. And she made James Bond himself Daniel Craig cry like a child. What a legend.
So funny to see the guy next to Kara, at the Adele concert, just stared straight forward in boredom, while Kara was enjoying the whole concert! 😂🤩
honestly 1 night in vegas is all you need
Carolina next year to go to
Seeing Kara cry for Adele and seeing how happy Nate was that she was happy reminded me of seeing Taylor Swift Live and how much my husband supported me and loved watching me be happy!! You guys are amazing and I love your videos, Hope to meet you some day when you are back in Iowa or near Iowa!!
Was hoping to see yall ride past when you hit Missouri!   Guess I missed my chance !
This video, in its glory was epic. I laughed out loud with you and almost cried with Kara at the concert. You guys are the sweetest.
My uncle and grandpa both live in ledvill Colorado
Fun!!! Can’t wait for the adventure.
That would be me if I ever got to see Derek Hough, Lindsey Stirling, or Lacey Sturm/Flyleaf in person.
Everybody loves Van 🚐 Life especially with a nice passive income to keep the wheels 🛞 spinning
I live in st.Louis and y’all passed my work coming in
Ok, you’ve done your job, we’re SO FREAKING inspired right now and we’re off to get a van ASAP 😅
it's a crazy town, full of neon dreams! - Jason Aldean
Where is your easy foldable bed
when i first saw this video i was on my way home from Oceanside california.
I built out a 2008 kia sorento on jellybean outdoors on youtube
I AM SO EXCITED I MISSED THE VAN LIFE VIDS AND THE BIKE VIDEOS FROM RAG BRIGH
I’ve been waiting for this video 😊
Is there any way to know your route and when you might be passing through somewhere.  Looks like your going right through my neighborhood in St Louis and I would love to watch you all bike past!!!
Watching Kara see Adele had me sobbing LOL
Nate likes to work harder not smarter. Solar panels should have been installed before leaving.
I smell a bike trip from southern California to Baja! Ammeyeright? 😅😅😅
Kara your reaction to Adele was my reaction to Morgan Wallen and Luke Combs I cried lol.... My daughter's reaction was beautiful even just typing that made me tear up. Her whole face lit up and I will never forget that excitement
You should have biked to the most eastern part of the US -- Lubec, Maine :)
Looks like the solar panel bolt was upside down and you were trying to slide the wrong side @5:02
One of the best decisions i've ever made was beginning to watch yall in 2021!
Oceanside native and big fan of the channel - so cool that you started the trip in my hometown.
I thought it was impossible to be as happy as Kara was. That gave me tears.
Hi can you go  to Barbos
So sad I missed you guys while in Vegas 😭😭😭😭
I love your travel vlogs. But van life just feels like home. This is how i found yall! SoThese adventures will always be my favorite to watch!
Damn I was really hoping the whole video y'all weren't about to say u were biking across America lmao 😂😅
Id love to see yall do a bushcraft series including building a snow cave shelter during a snow storm.
I love how Nate makes sure he makes the morning coffee for Kara. And what brought me to your channel was van life. Wasn’t expecting to see this, but this gives me a lot of joy. I hope it does for you too. 😊
I love the fact that you stopped through Hays Kansas! Please let me know next time you guys are in town and I could show you around cuz I love watching your shows!
I live in Vegas!
I’m so happy you got see Adele Kara that’s something I would love to tick of my bucket list to say I have done #livelaughloveAdele 😂 I’m so going to try book tickets for the November show and fly from London to Las Vegas ITS A NEED I HAVE TO GO! I might actually cry the whole night tho because I love her so much ❤ You watching her brought a great big happy smile to my face and it was the highlight of my day! Love you guys sm pray for me that I get tickets for the November show!❤😂
PCT?
This makes me so happy! I love van life videos and none are as good as K&N’s. Now I can add more stars to google maps for when I get my van!
Adele!! what a moment. We saw Elton John at the Coliseum when we were there. I cried I was so happy.
Adele...oh my heart, I would love to see her! Can't wait to watch the bike journey!
I'm guessing this surprise is you're having a baby❤
I live in Leadville Colorado and when I heard Leadville the usual term, Leadville Colorado doesn’t usually come up and when I heard it I was like oh I live there
Yay! So happy van life videos are back! You both need to do a van life video trip around Michigan you would love it!
I feel really invested in you guys. Ive been watching a LONG time. Seeing Kara so happy just made my month!!!!
Omg I’ve been waiting for sooooo long
omg i love van life videos!! so excited they're back!!
Could be the most special Kara and Nate video of all time 🥹
Kara and Nate I LIVE IN KENTUCKY!!! What a coincidence! 😂
"no idea who the tigers are"  you were in st.robert missouri. judging by the tigers merch for msu (missouri state university) and i recognize the walmart in that part of the video
It is so hard to believe that I have been on the same bridge in Kentucky on a family vaca as my favorite YouTube's!!!!!!!!!!😀😀😀
Woow I'm soooo happy for you Kara!! That must have been such a beautiful experience. I'm so very happy for you!!!
What type of bike is it? Who is the manufacturer?
Missouri is my state!!!!!!! I can't believe you all where in Missouri!!!! Wish we could have coffee!!!!!
Awesome video as always Kara and Nate. So glad that Vanlife is back. Vanlife Kara and Nate are so awesome and so adventurous.
I live in rural Missouri the Ozarks to be exact and you dont know what you are missing here, however, you have to get off those main highways, get away from the big city lights and do some back coutry roadin and some dirt roadin  to see and appreciate Missouri. Maybe some day in your future you will come back and truly see how beautiful the Ozarks are in Missouri. ❤ love you guys looking forway to your van journey ❤❤
Honestly i enjoy watching you guys but international content is SO much more entertaining than van life. Please don't go back to van life for long!!
Seeing Kara cry about Adele had me in tears!!!
So glad to see you all back in the van! I do love you van videos
Hi, my 7 year old daughter Ida and I are huge fans and have been following you on YouTube for 4 years. We were excited to hear when you announced your biking trip across America that your final destination is in DC where we live. If you are doing a fan meet up, we’d like to say hello! 🙏 Vlad and Ida
It would be amazing if you and Kara were on the Amazing Race 🎉
I think you  Are doing a marathon
I’m sooo sad!! Y’all was in my little hometown in Kansas and I missed it!! You literally have fans in every part of the world! It’s so awesome💕💕
Have you been to the Corn Palace in Mitchell SD? If not you need to stop and check it out.
ive been to oceanside!!!
Born and raised in Northern Utah! If you wanna see some beautiful country... Check out Mirror Lake, and hike the Bald Mountain trail. It's absolutely breathtaking!
OMG good luck
This was a great video ❤️ While I love all the content you guys make it was nice to have a van life video again. Feels personal, like on an adventure with friends ☺️  To Sarah and Dusty, I want to see more of y’all! Loved your interactions and vlogging on the canoe trip! ❤️
Kara and Nate I was beginning to wonder if or when y’all were going to be getting back in the van
Yes van life is great adventure
The people y’all are going with have those 2 kids
Omg yay I’m so happy for y’all
It’s ColorRADo! 😂 cause Colorado is Rad!!!
I love Adele also Kara. And you're right every interview I've seen of her age hust seems so genuine and open.
50 state goal
I missed van life....I love van life
OK that was fun. Thanks enjoyed it a lot.
Adele.... worth it! Happy for you Kara!
🤗🤗 Thank you! Awesome video. Pops is great. Beautiful restoration on VW Bus!!😍 yep, i need tissues.😉😊👍
Kara getting so excited about Adele and Nate just sitting there smiling is just everything. I am so glad van life is back!!
This video is just amazing. Seeing Kara _so happy_ getting to see her favorite singer was just everything. I know how emotions can be so overwhelming and the tears just flow. No, those tickets were not cheap, but what's a few thousand dollars to make her dreams come true? She deserves it and I'm so, so happy for her. ❤🤗
*"It feels good to be sleeping at Walmarts again."*  _Kara, 2023_ 😄
Dusty has come such a long way from sleeping down the center of your van’s floor while doing the Colorado Trail 😅
Rick and Beck?????!!!!!! So excited to see what's coming next for you guys!😄
Wish yall visited Terribles gas station in Jean's NV.
This must be one of my favorite videos from you two. I think its because Kara was so happy to see Adele that I was amazed. You guys continue putting out great videos of you alls journeys. Be careful and keep up the good work. Many thanks😋😋
Kara is the Adele of travel blogging! 👸🏻🎵🎤🎶🎉❤
I missed the crossing the border tradition
I think we saw you outside of Mexican Hat!! We had just done a bikepacking trip around Cedar Mesa and saw three dudes on a trandom climbing the big hill and thought “how the heck does THAT happen.” Now I wish we’d stopped!  Way to go y’all.
Adele’s show was amazing. I saw it opening weekend and was fully worth it. If you want to come to Ventura,CA after Oceanside I have a driveway you can park in.
LOL I have one final upgrade to make to my van before I head out to meet up with a friend tomorrow and this maybe motivated me to do it even though I also have NO TIME!!
I question the posibility of securing front row center seats for Aele only a few hours before the concert. I realize you guys are prining you own money  but to waste $10,000 on something you are already enjoying on CD astounds me.
Nate, for future references if you ever need something to slide in a groove to bolt too again. You can go to almost any hardware store and buy a spring nut and just pull the spring off and its just  a rectangle hunk of metal you slide into your groove and theres a threaded hole in it to screw your bolt into!
I honestly can say that I do enjoy the van videos more than the videos of villa's where you guys can stay. It is fun for a while to watch them but for me the video's aren't as special.
condom?
Please read this 🙏 The Israeli occupation, a fact even acknowledged by Israelis, traces back to 1948 when the Balfour Declaration of 1917 pledged support for a Jewish national home in Palestine. This historical context is essential to understanding the plight of Palestinians. For over 70 years, Palestinians have endured displacement, restricted movement, and lived under harsh conditions. The term “apartheid” aptly describes the segregation and discrimination they face in their own land, marked by numerous Israeli checkpoints. Despite countless peaceful attempts, oppression persists, leading to further land loss and human suffering. It’s important to note that Hamas, often a focus of international attention, emerged as a response to active resistance against this enduring injustice. If you trying to feel sorry for Israelis today I hope you felt sorry for Palestinians for the past 70 years 🙏. Give the people their homes and country back.🙏
Would love to see you on van life europe!
Seeing adele has been my dreammmm for a long time! A lot of her songs I can relate to. I’m so happy you got to see her!! ❤ great episode
Do you nit need a drop vent for the propane box?
I don’t do instagram…
Kara is so cute I cant! your videos never fail to make me happy
Wait! Sarah and Dusty have their own van now?! 😂  Kara—your playfulness lowering your head from above in the bloopers was hysterical. Loved it.
Ive seen Adele in concert here in NZ and its totally worth it. Love seeing Kara excitement about seeing her.
Id give ANYTHING to go to Adele's show!! I swear Id look EXACTLY like Kara while watching! ❤😊
I was in veags 4 days ago
i was in vegas 4 days ago
I love gelnwood cannon. I have been there so many time its so cool. Did you drive through Aspen??
Kara you are so lucky to get coffee in bed everyday!!  ...good job Nate!!! You guys are the cutes!!!
24 nate
Van life bike ride my ass, you’re in San Francisco at a conference.
“quick before anybody see us “
🍁 I would like to know how do you know about blue’s clues?
Nate, every time I see your mustache, you remind me of a French waiter! You just need the black and white stripe shirt, a baguette 🥖 and a glass of red wine 🍷. My hubby and I love you guys! 💕
🍁 I think you should take everything out of the van and restart
Me and my dad went across America and back from NC in 3 weeks
We got to see her in February… we love her! I cried, I laughed, I sang until I was hoarse. I will always pay to see her. So happy you got to see her 🎉 Love you guys!!!
all the best guys...enjoyyyy a lot
They let us down 🇮🇱💔  Hey, my name is Gal. I'm from Israel, I've been a fan and a follower of Kara and Nate for the past 5 years. Last Saturday as most of you probably know, a horrible inhuman massacre happened here in Israel, over 1200 innocent people were brutally murdered and thousand were injured. because Israel is such a small place everyone here knows someone who was hurt in this attack.  The most casualties in the attack were taken in a music festival near Gaza and a lot of the casualties are tourists that just came to listen to music together. In this hard time for me and to my people they uploaded a video, as in any other usual week, and continuously post in instagram but stay silent till this day from addressing the horrors.  As influencers I believe they have to speak up against this horrible day in human history, the day that jews were murdered like the times of the holocaust. Anyone who is afraid to address this situation make it legitimate. I'm very hurt by them and I hope they will speak up eventually. As in this moment they lost me and let me down. God bless you all, may we have peace as soon as possible.
I have a good video idea, Iowa has a lot of Amish towns and you should try some Amish food
Cracker Barrel really is the best pancakes lol
Great video and that is going to be a awesome bike ride
Can I ask what / if you guys consider the environmental impact of the planes you take ? Not to be mean or to judge, just out of interest :)
love it
So bored with challenges.  I stopped watching your videos a while back because the challenge content is just getting ridiculous.  Good for you for pushing yourselves but I just can’t watch another video with narcissistic Nate.
Some friends of mine from Amarillo Texas have moved to Oceanside.  I told them to look out for Ya'll. ❤ Krystal Ridling. Her son is Autistic and loves to ride the rides. Hes a grown guy, so precious. If you stop in Amarillo ill meet you for coffee?
i absolutely love adele, it is my dream to go see her 🤍i'm going to enjoy these next few van videos! (even though i do like watching all your videos)
lol y'all absolutely did not realize when you actually crossed into Colorado
Colloquialism!!! Everybody from Middle TN calls them Kroger bags, not Walmart bags (AR), plastic bags (like, everywhere else)... how to spot true natives! 😂 love you guys!!! Hope you're having fun on the bike trip!
your bike trip videos are my comfort videos im so freaking excited for this new one/journey!!
maybe you can swing through those states you missed on your 50 state circuit that you failed to complete. Two birds with one promise.....
Hold on is that their child..?
BTW-had you thought about visiting Trent and Alley as you go thru Utah???
"I feel my heartbeat in my head." Exactly the sensation at 13 k ft.
The Tiger you saw in Hays, Kansas is the mascot for Fort Hays State University. So cool to see you camping out in my old stomping grounds.
PLEASE… it’s Ne-VAD-ah. Not Nuh-vah-dah.
can we talk about Nate’s calves?? 0:54
Talking so much smack on Missouri smh 😂
Do y'all exercise on long drive days? How do you not feel all tight and uncomfortable?!
I live next to Oceanside. My guess is there are a lot of van builders there so you are doing upgrades. Great to see you back in the van so we can live vicariously through you again.. I finished the video and my guess was wrong. Stay safe riding and my taint hurts just thinking about riding 100 miles a day.
I have stayed in circus circus... yes it looks ran down but its one of the best cheap hotels.. stay there and go to the amusement park inside you will have a ball 😊
Love your vids!  Makes my day
The fact that they stayed 3.5 miles away from me and basically showed my town with the drone footage and I didn't get to meet them! 😢
Biking gloves x10 ?
We’ve stayed at the KOA on the Vegas strip! It was a interesting experience lol
The dipping the  bike makes me think of terry fow
i need a husband so we can do these videos together lol
You should put Christmas lights in the van
Lovin ya less here in Missouri 😉
Im so happy
I thought you would continue your journey in the remote Pacific islands like Nuku Hiva, Norfolk Island etc.😢
Wow
I love a good road trip  especially thru Colorado and Utah. Utah has some amazing view areas! 💗 Love how excited Kara was for Adele. 🥰
I think we are still in Kansas? Lol, I miss home. Go Ft. Hays State Tigers 😊
OHHHHHH I LIVE IN DCCCCC HOPE TO SEEEEE YOU FUYAYAYSYAYSGUYS
Yay!!!!  So excited
Jesus loves you! ❤
🇮🇱💔
Wooo you guys step up the level , i’ve started watching the vlogs from the philippines. How crazy
So love seeing you back
You guys should totally stream irl on twitch
Yall should vist the northern lights
You could see all the dudes at the concert looking miserable 😂😂
Please come to Toronto Canada
Seeing Kara’s excitement about the concert, made me cry happy tears!!! I’m the same way at concerts !!! ( with Blake Shelton, Tim McGraw, Cole Swindle, Chase Rice….)
I can’t wait for this next big adventure but I am really excited to see Nate and his grandfather do van life together ❤ so precious!!
Coming to my town?! Dope
you guys should come to Florida! Crystal river to swim with manatees, Orlando for the theme parks, everglades camping/swamp adventures, weeki wachee springs kayak trip! The Florida keys snorkeling and scuba diving, St Augustine fort, Cocoa beach for to do bioluminescence kayaking, Devils den scuba diving or snorkeling, and soo much more!
So glad to see the van back!
Happy wife makes for a happy life!
I love that you went and saw Adele. I also love her and it is a dream of mine to see her :)
Thank you van  life is back!!
Why don’t you mount the solar panels onto a hinged frame that covers the decking.  Then on the odd occasion you want to use the decking just lift the panel up. Plus you can optimise it for the sun.
Crazy the bike all the way across the entire United States. Pops then looks beautiful! ❤🇺🇸🙏🏻
❤❤❤
It’s so nice seeing you guys back in the van! I wish you luck for your future travels😊
You have to speak up for the massacre happened in Israel
Another wonderful show!❤
Adele concert while camping out.
Yesssssss Ric is back! Love him and his families energy.
Bloody brilliant ….. 🤗
What’s the rv park near circus circus called
The concert was Kara's heart moment. Seeing this grandfather van trip, is mine. But, I think I remember him saying you could sleep in his and he was going for your comfortable one.❤  can not wait to be part of that adventure. He needs a special sweat shirt, fleece jacket...something personalized with bragging rights.  Back to the video. Tell us the route taking on bikes.
Yuuuuuusssss!!!! The Van-Life videos were definitely my favorite series. I was so sad when you said goodbye to the van, but now I’m elated to see you back in the van with your Bro and Homie! I can’t wait to watch your upcoming adventure! 💕
I just saw Adele too! I also weaped. It was so good! I had a similar reaction to getting tickets😂
We love the van life videos! ❤
As a Hays, KS resident I appreciate that you slept well at our local WalMart 😉 Go Tigers!
Circus circus is so far down the strip towards downtown! But you guys are fit and used to walking in cities around the world! Next time park at the Tuscany Casino and Suites. Much closer and no one cares if your oversized vehicle is there. 👍
Kara is SOOO real about Adele. I love them both😂😂
Can't wait to see the adventure y'all are taking. Have the best time
So crazy how circus circus is run down now when that way THE place to go when I was younger
If you're going to stick with Van Life you should start watching college football.  That will connect you with the country.
Oh my goodness I grew up going to that Cracker Barrel in MO. My grandma lives 10 minutes from there.🥺🥰
Guy sitting next to kara at that concert didn't look happy. I wouldn't either not a fan of adele otherwise looking forward to video of the camp trip with your grandfather
This was awesome, ur two energy is off the charts!
OMG! You two yelling out the state names was too much! 🤣😂🤣😂❤️❤️ Love it!
I can’t sit through I movie but I’ve been watching Kara and Nate for 6 hours now hahahahah I love them so much I wanna travel so bad just like them and they prove it’s possible
anyone else from missouri that gets excited when they travel through it????
This is an awesome episode! I can't wait to see all you guys on the bicycle adventure across the usa! Have fun! Just think that you are at a big ragbrai in Iowa!
Woot woot Kansas! Lol
You Guys should have a baby
Love Kara’s excitement for the Adele concert.  Could luck on the bike adventure.  Wow!  I myself have joined part time van life.  I just returned from 17 days in the northeast.  I did Cracker Barrel as well as camp sites.  And a hotel for an event.
I like Kara and Nate, but haven’t watched much lately because of all the expensive type trips/videos. I liked the Monkey motorcycle “race” and a few others, but that’s about it. I’m excited for this. Back to being a little more real. Let’s go!
Love your videos, normally. But do you have to talk about Missouri 😢  Also the chant is obnoxious AF.  But I love that Kara got to do something for her!!  I’ll be here for every video still.
I know exactly how you feel about the seats you had at the concert! I saw Yul Brenner in one of his final performances in The King and I. Our seats were front row center 1st mezzanine!!! I’ll never forget the experience!
The road instantly getting better the second you left colorado......is the most colorado thing ive ever seen in my life
I knew what was happening after clue 1
.... She's pregnant and driving to enjoy things before the next chapter.  *just my guess*
Ya’ll inspired us to buy our first bus last year!  Also, we’re from Vegas, glad you enjoyed the city ☺️♥️  && you should have camped up by Red Rock Canyon!! We take our bus there some nights to enjoy the scenery ☺️
YOUR GETTING A DOG!
I like the Show me State I was borned in Mo!  Come on!
I'm excited about this adventure with your grandpa !!!!!  And the bike across America too.
You’re doing what?….
Come visit we live in mill Valley
Hi guys, I love it when you living in your van. Very exciting about your new very long bike trip! It makes me happy to see how  Kara was happy with the Adele concert. And I am proud for Nate, fixing the sun collectors. Love from Italy❤😊
OMG, I stayed in an RV at Circus Circus in 1996 with my family when I was 11 (I'm from Australia).
Struggling to get past the fact that Kara doesn’t like pancakes??!!!!!!
i missed your van life  videos then i saw this. if i did not have people over i would scream
12:46 I’m there all the time bro I could’ve saw u guys lol 😂❤
I was thinking they were gonna bike across California 😂 but the whole United States 😮 good luck guys
I was sitting in computer class this morning watching this after I got my work done😂
Appalachian trail?
Awwww you guys went through my state.
Namaste🙏I love watching your videos; I do Have a suggestion : There is a country called Tuvalu in Oceania; One of the smallest and beautiful, You will love that and as well as do you know where the worlds tallest temple is being made ? LOvE YoU✌
Kara crying for Adele is so relatable 😅
It’s always the biggest adventure the best ever!! Need to not always be the biggest and best
OK Mr. Nate, I see those arm veins popping! Clearly you are both in excellent shape, very strong LOL
I wonder if Kara has been homesick and is at a point in life where she still wants to travel, still wants adventure, but also wants the comfort of family, friends and home (aka the U.S.). It broke my heart when you announced no more van life, but maybe possibly perhaps in the future. I wasn't ready to see you leave, although I have LOVED all of your videos since then. I feel like you are back home and I'm here for it!
I am honestly SO HAPPY to see you both back in the van and going on adventures all around the country. :-)
Do these ppl have no jobs?
If you didn't cry, when Kara cried... 😭😭😭😭
Utah people prefer "Life Elevated" as our unofficial saying over "Industry"
I live a few miles from that Cracker Barrel in St. Louis! Nice adventure guys!
have some kids.
Wish I knew when you were coming thru St. Louis in the bikes - I would come out and cheer you on!  But I’m only on Facebook and. I other social media sites ☹️.  But good luck and I hope you get great weather!
Oh man, I am looking forward to the video with you grandpa Nate! Enjoy the trip across America via this INSANE bike! Have a blast and be safe!   I eventually want to do Hwy 101 from the top to the bottom! I'll eventually start training... :P
pocket fuzz lmao I'm too excited!  Feel like al be doing something exciting haha tfa x
Wowzers!  Good luck to you all, look forward to this adventure :)
My husband and I also chant the state name at the border and then the new state once we cross!  Just got back from a trip from Missouri to Wisconsin and did this.  I also drive from Missouri to Las Vegas via Denver and that scenery looks so familiar!
To see Kara so excited over Adele is beautiful! I love her the same! ❤️❤️
Kara: "Nate and Dusty went straight into cracker barrel, for pancakes - at 7:00am"  Me: They are living the life
O-side or no side!!! That rv park is super nice, love to see oceanside get love
GLAD YOURE BACK DOING CRAZY FUN AND INVENTIVE STUFF
At 14:10 you are in Hays Kansas! Home of the Fort Hays State University Tigers! I was born in Arvada Colorado, but call Hays home. Don’t let the highway flat fool ya! It is a great place to be! Huge fan! Screamed and scared my dog when I recognized the walmart!🙃
❤❤❤
MO is the Show Me state because we don't believe it until you prove it.
Next time you’re in Oside, there’s a half Iron Man for Nate the challenger 😉 it’s in April! Plenty of time to prep for it
Covid gone long ago
Have missed your van life vids - probably my favourites
I love you guys so much. You guys cane through my state Missouri. If you ever cone through Missouri again you need to make a stop through Washington MO and come down to Undergrounds Espresso Bar I'm the Barista Trainer there I'll make you guys an excellent cup of coffee. From one Nate to another and one coffee lover to another I love you guys my uncle got me hooked on you and I have been watching ever sense.
love watching you guys.   Our grandkids watch with us and Nate, my one granddaughter told me to tell you she agrees with you that you should shave your mustache.
I’m confused still what blue’s clues had to do with anything?
Love your videos been excited for this video I'm currently at home with COVID so I'm binge watching all of your videos that I've missed so far I've been loving everyone of them
Did y’all have a kid? 😮😮
Park at the LINQ open air lot next to the Ferris wheel for $18 for 24 hours during the week.  $23 for 24 hours on weekends.  You can sleep in your van there
Indian ocean 😅 thats a hell of a ride😂
I loved the episode. So happy that you guys are doing van life again, and I'm excited to see what the whole van life team gets up to, shenanigans or otherwise.
Leadville marathon!!!! That's intense
I love that they call them "Kroger Bags" even when they are not from Kroger. We do that too!
You ever want an idea for a stop for your road trip, I live in a town called Sandwich 🤣😍 I’d love to meet y’all one day!😭
So excited that Kara got to see Adele. And my 4 yo son liked when you guys starting to sing the states when you entered each one lol. I also love the van life series this is one of my favorites ❤
You guys will bike across America
I’m so happy to be able to see Kara so so happy and filled with joy It makes me happy
I LOVE ADELE! WHOOO! GOD BLESS Y'ALL AND MUCH LOVE TO YOU GUYS! :)
You’re just like 2 little kids in a toy store but you’re inside the van, truly awesome! 😄👍👍
28:03 parking grifters!!!!
Ya gotta take us into the path of the solar eclipse Oct. 14👍
Excited for the video ❤❤❤
Thanks Kara & Nat for bringing Van life vlogs back., they are the videos I really enjoy watching on your channel :D
Woohoo you will be giving the hardest geezer a run for his money!
They way they cross over states is so heart warming❤🫶🏼❤🫶🏼❤
You drove within a mile of our house in Columbia, MO! You could have parked on our beautiful street and plugged in for free! We also have a van and lots of tools. That would have been so fun!
Awe ! You guys are gonna be right below me im in Pennsylvania right across the border from DC!
Netflix has a different library based on your location?
Very ambitious!!!  Looking forward to it!!!  And the camping trip with Grampa! xx
I'm glad you are back and are safe. Can't wait to see your new van adventures.
Kansas will always be the most boring state to drive through. Best thing ever to reach Colorado.
As someone who lives in Colorado I'd love to meet you guys in a state you absolutely love ❤ Pueblo Co over here not native though!
Random question does anybody know the brand of sweater Nate’s wearing at 16:35
Kara I understand your Adele obsession.  I saw Jill Scott in late March I felt euphoria for days after.   So I get it  I am happy you got to see her live.
Awe this is an adventure for sure. Can't wait to see th VW trip. When my sis and I were 9 and 10 we went on a trip with out grandparents from California to New York in a VW van poptop  best memories as a kid to this day!!
its just getting better and better
“The best money I have ever spent on kara” 🫠 as if Kara doesn’t bust her booty editing and make the money too.
Love to get a selfie with you guys when you are in DC! Been watching u guys forever!
In a weird way I’m glad 2020 Happened or I would have never been bored at home and then one day finding Kara and Nate blogs to watch they have become such a routine in my life
Guys, I am relieved to know you are safe and not in Israel. be safe my friends.
I sit here in my small town Oklahoma and watch your channel among others of all your travels! Bet you didn’t know you had me with you did you?😊❤
When will you be coming through DC? We have a place in Rockville and are at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and would love to meet you!
Just want to make sure you know the Atlantic Ocean is approx 2.5 hours east of Washington DC! You could always dip the wheel in the Potomac River 😂
The van is back !! Weird question, how many miles does the van have on it ?
I cant wait to see the great adventure, but as someone that misses her grandparents so much, I got more excited about the announcement of the next video 🥺🥺🥺
Ahh you guys were just in Vegas so we're we that would have been so cool to see you guys out and about in the casinos.
0:52  The No. 1 reason for premature failure is oil staining. Halogen bulb glass must be perfectly clean. A single fingerprint can cause the bulb to burn out.
You stayed at the Cracker Barrel in Missouri that’s literally 10 mins from where I live!!
The guy sitting next to Kara at the concert🤣 I think his ticket was given to him, not a happy camper.
I believe the Wal Mart you overnighted in Kansas was in Hays, KS. The Tigers are Ft Hays State University which is located there.
Glad you’re back in the van. So excited to see you get Adele tickets. Well jell!  Good luck with you’re adventure x
I love how Kara is acting over Adele.  I sing like this on road trips all of the time and I love her passion and excitement about seeing Adele!
The screaming across state lines is so annoying.   Later…
I am a seventh grader from Springview Ne and I love to see your videos! I love to see and watch all your crazy adventures! ( I've been watching you for 5 years now!)
Great episode.
actuator for gray water tank?
Wow, what an amazing adventure. You guys, this is going to be epic. Looking forward to your trip with Grandpa.❤
Kara and Nate!!! Please please please set up a meet up when you guys get to DC or announce where the finish line will be!! Would love to celebrate this amazing adventure with you at the end!!!
You guys need a rather bigger van.
As much as I love your videos together, I can light weight tell Nate has some narcissistic personalities that show up. For example in this video, as you guys passed by the Utah sign (which IS NOT a big deal) Nate couldn't help but say that "if he was driving this wouldn't happen" -_- Nate, it's not Karas' fault that YOU did not get the stupid sign. Get over yourself. Get over the sign.
Adele is my fav too!! I cried a little when Kara did. If you’re going to see her that has to be the best way. Love Kara and Nate!!
Oh I’ve missed the van!!  (Ok sing this part please) I know what the challenge is!  Because I get the newsletter!  😂. Really missed CO. Lived in Denver.  Gorgeous state!!
I feel the same about Adele!!  ✌️💜
I love your videos! Especially when you are in my home state of Colorado!! Glenwood canyon is absolutely beautiful ❤️
Kara’s excitement is infectious!
Woo hoo
Hi dear Kara & Nate,  what a nice plan biking across West coast from Ocwan Side.  Since you will come to San Francisco, I would love to see all of you.  Please let me know which day you will reach here, I live in San Francisco.  Thank you💕💕💕
Seeing Adele would be so incredible!! Lucky you!!
@CrackerBarrel
Id totally cry at her show too. I’ve cried at Beyonce and Celine Dion’s shows easily 😂
Good job, 👍
If the next video is an extra video, maybe upload on a different day, then normal, and maybe you should upload with live comments. Also it looked like you two had a lot of fun
Missed the van vlogs! My fav
I saw a van crunched into the ceiling of a parking garage when I was there. They were letting air out of the tires to try to get it out.
YES, VAN LIFE
You guys are great but the state line things is really annoying.
Wow a waste of solar power
The most beautiful, majestic canyon -- and we only saw a flash of it with the high speed replay.  Too bad.
Kara's "adele performer" is a good play on "resident performer" term to which Nate was referring.
The kitchen sink in my new apartment "sneezes" almost every time I use it... It always makes me laugh...
Kara!! Nate!! In the camper! I’ve been watching since the day you first went on the trip across the us ❤️❤️
Do a van trip from Canada to Panama.
Glad you got to see Adele 🐶❤️
I love love these long videos. Give me more lol
Is it just me or is anyone else dying to get a tour of the other two vans? I must have missed van life content!
I just cried watching Kara getting to see Adele, I totally understand why she was so excited, and what an amazing experience that was to get to have. And what an awesome and absolutely crazy adventure this bike trip will be. And like always, cannot wait to see your next videos, especially Nate's camping trip with his pops. Awesome memories to make for sure
Hey! I live in Missouri! We also call it Misery Missouri. Because the weather ALWAYS changing
😂😂😂 you didn’t just installed the solar panel you also got a tan
Why is Kara so cute, I can't handle it! 😩😂😂 This was fun episode 😁👌
I love that you love CO! I just unsubscribed from Eamon and Beck because they posted a video thinking it was funny to count how many times they could say ROOF the way they think everyone in the US says it and I was offended. Just sayin I love you guys
No children ever?? How sad, and even sadder when one is older, sigh....
Hope you come back to Oceanside for Race Across America! 🚲
Co for me is white water rafting
If you don't plan on crying at a Adele concert, you shouldn't go.
omg - huge announcement!  I thought you were pregnant!!
Can't wait to welcome you guys in DC... please announce when you arrive so I can be there to cheer you at the end 🎉🎉
19:49 personal
You guys are soooo cute. Love love Kara's enthusiasm for Adele. Your excitement is infectious.
Can’t wait to see the video next week in the van with your dad 🥹
Kara I totally understand your excitement for Adele. I went to see Usher in April at his residency in Vegas and it was the best concert/live performance I ever went to and he’s one of my favorite artists of all time! I was just in shock for most of the concert. I couldn’t believe I was seeing him 😂 the tickets were expensive but it was worth every penny!!
Watching this video makes me realize a professionally built van is so much better than diy. Every issue with conversions I see is always self built vans 😅
That's my alma mater, Fort Hays State University, and the FHSU Fighting Tigers!
Love love love Kara's face in this ❤❤❤  This is how I feel with my favourites ❤️❤️❤️
I mean, she’s one of the most talented people on the planet, seeing Kara cry definitely got me. You’re not an awful husband Nate 🇨🇦
As a german visited your starting and end point seeing you travel to the hole country give me so much good memories. Pure excitement…
Not you guys staying at my local Cracker Barrel 😂 - so excited for more Van Life videos!
Its good seeing you in the Van again..
It is great to see you both happy in the van.
Van life is the best content on your channel!
Yo. Dusty in the background with the pancakes. This man is out of this world 😂
omg y'all are gonna bike right past me!
Don’t knock the show me state!! Lol it just means we don’t believe you until you show me.
Happy to see you back on the road, Kara and Nate 🚐
Hi
Fun fact you need a magnet for the shower head to stick too. It is magnetic but it’s just magnetic metal. The magnet itself is attached to the main shower holder. For it to stick to something on the outside of the van you need to hang a magnet
Nice!! Headed to Vegas end of this month too!!
Back in 2017, I booked a ticket to see Adele in Sydney the day before the concert - and booked a flight to fly there that very night (from Singapore) 😃 LOVED watching Kara’s excitement!!
I don't understand how 90% of YouTube influencers have the most vanilla taste in music
Seeing Kara cry during the concert made me tear up too😭💕 But there is nothing like going to see your idol/idols live. 😍🤖
Be careful in DC.Good luck and God bless.
Welcome to the California desert ❤😂
but i thought Kara love pancakes a little detail perhaps❓❓
This might be my favourite vlog of yours! So much joy and so many laughs, loved how emotional Kara got at Adele and of course the english accent impressions! Can't wait to see this next trip :)
I miss you
Did anyone know where  can i buy kettle? Like they used for coffe:)
Have you thought about driving to Alaska ?  It is a good 6-8 week trip .
32:35 where is Kara’s hat from? I love it! 😍
What van do you have?
Awesome, love your infectious nature make the World so much fun and worth getting out there to explore...safe travels
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Apparently nate's parent have their own campervan now
Hopefully he doesn't end her like Gabby😢
i had to make a slight chuckle when you noted hays kansas on your map i actually lived there for a short time as a young child.      also utah also has a secondary quote "greatest snow on earth" i was born and raised in utah it has some of the most beautiful mountains in the country
If you go to Amarillo we will go to??? Eat somewhere lol love Karas list stuff! Safe travels sweeties ❤
Nate now that you are back in the van..kick Kara to the curb..SERIOUS
The St. George gorge between St. George, Utah in Mesquite, Nevada is also a beautiful canyon to drive through and quite often. You will see goats in there as well. That’s just about hour and 30 minutes from Vegas. Which I’m pretty sure you already know because you guys drove through there on your way to Vegas.😂❤ want to stay on the campground on the Las Vegas strip it’s awful it’s down by the Circus Circus of the most dangerous places on the strip and there’s nothing down there but concrete you’re not missing anything welcome to my city!
seeing Kara get emotional at Adele is me at every concert ahahhah!! love you guys and I am so so super excited to see these upcoming videos!!
Now THAT is huge.  You kids are a trip!
I got excited I thought it was ragbri😢 but……. This is EVEN BETTER!!!!
Well good luck going across the USA. KEEP THE RUBBER SIDE DOWN
That is the most ANOYING SOUND the two of you going into one state to tge next . AAAANNNOYYYYINGGGGG ANNNNNOOOYYYYING. ANNNNNOYYYINNGGGG ANNNNNOYYYYYING
that british accent heart my soul 💥💔💥💔
i missed your van adventures
Yes Kara, you are 100% worth it ❤
You  should  go to Aruba
Pan American highway
I seen the walk you can do from Cape town (South Africa) to magadan (russia) 4492 hour travel on foot... I have screen shot it but not sure how to screenshot something to you
Hi... I love watching your adventures and love your relationship... you life is great I know its not all ups and love but its really looks great
14:51 My wife and I live in Colorado Springs! The view from our backyard is literally Pikes Peak 🙂
If you’re coming to Canada you MUST come to  Calgary Alberta at the beginning of July!  That’s when the  Calgary Stampede “The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth” happens and the city really turns out! Plus Banff, Kananaskis and Lake Louise  are so close! Our family would happily host you and tour you around the area. Please come!
Let’s go
Kara is glowing 🌷🌷🌷☀️☀️☀️
I love watching your videos, even though Nate’s comment about “it’s better than the show me state” hurt my heart just a little bit 😂😂😂 happy to see can life videos again!! Safe travels!
since 2020 I enjoyed watching your videos it makes me feel like I'm on vacation :) I always get on youtube at night time to watch till i go bed. so keep up with videos u sure a smile on my face.
I had happy tears watching Kara tear up!!! Love you guys
Hi Kara and Nate! My wife and I love your videos! We just had a newborn last week and we know you’re in our hometown of San Diego! We wish the best and thanks for all the great content!
I just watched Kara's first solo van trip to meet baby hank and I could totally see a little baby or toddler Kara or Nate running around outside the van or jumping on the bed in the van in a Bucc'ees onesie   I love y'all so much keep reaching for the stars guys
Screw the hike, I’ll take the ME day
kara seeing adele made me tear up that was so wholesome! so excited for this next van/bike adventure- i love the group and the vlogs of these💗
Can you do a meet and greet in Ocean side! I would feel if like Kara met Adel!!!
Is there any chance that your next adventure is thru hiking the PCT trail or something? Cuz if it is i will loose my shit cuz i have been waiting for u guys to do that for sooo long
you guys put so many ads in ur vids ontop of already being sponsored every video. I’m unsubscribing
Hi you two, my daughter and I were in the van and RV on the other side of the parking lot/look out above Lake Henshaw from you and your friends.What a great place to spend the night. Hope you didn't catch any of that rain on your bike.Guess I will find out in the next video. Have a great journey!
I happened to be in Vegas that same weekend and had to pass on Adele because of the price. Seeing Kara’s joy made up for it! So glad you had an epic time 🤍
Oceanside California? That's where my family vacations every now and then, fun to see it on a Kara and Nate video.
Utah is 'Life Elevated' !  ✌️👋
Our new motto for Colorado is:  Come for the Pot, stay for the Heroin.  Seriously...If you're staying in Colorado, stay away from Denver.
"The capital of the United States, Washington D.C. is part of the region known as the East Coast but is landlocked and is sandwiched between Maryland and Virginia. "   You folks may have to add a few miles to your trip to wet that bike tire in the Atlantic Ocean ~  Best Wishes.
My husband and I are flying from Australia to Las Vegas next year to see Garth Brooks…..I’ve waited 30yrs for the chance to see him!
Kara was so happy and exited for Adele. She deserved it so much. Seeing her that exited put a big smile on my face, and everything else.
Where can we find the video of Nate and his grandfather?
I love you guys and I live in DC please post when you get here I won't love to meet you
As an avid follower, it would mean a lot if you show support for Israel in your platforms....we're all heartbroken, it's hard for me to believe you haven't heard about any of the events..
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yes Grandpa Buchanan! Family while can.
I love it! The variety on your channel is amazing! I have day funny story about going or should I say not going to see Adele! My friend was sitting at the nurses station  when her husband texted and said " I don't care how much the tickets are I want to see Adele in concert!" So my friend proceeded to find out where she was playing and found out it was in Las Vegas...ok a little further away than they planned but ok. Then she looked at ticket prices! 😂 She turned around to all of us and said " I know he said he didn't care how much, but I better double check." His response  " OH h*ll no!" 😂  Seeing Kara so happy was wonderful! I am glad there is blessing and success balanced with roughing it by choice.
YES! I'm so excited for these next few videos and the camping trip with pops.
Kara and Nate are going to ride their bikes from California to Seattle WA
You need to visit Chandler's wildlife in Florida. Nate needs to feed Miss Toothy the Cuban crocodile and you need to see Kevin the King Cobra
This is all soooo good. Bike trip, cool.  Nate and your grandfather, epic!!!
Should have just go with LED on the headlights
SO excited to see you guys doing van life again! by far my favorite series types!
Fort Hays State Tigers (for the tiger merch in Kansas)!!
You should have yelled out that it is my birthday!
Pls do the 50 states goal
Hey i work at a mercedes dealership near oceanside. Let me know if you need any work done on your sprinter van! Safe travels
Aren’t you guys like multi- gazillionaires by now?  Go ahead and splurge on some luxury parking & hotel.  ☺️ How fun for Kara!!
Looking forward to your video with Pops!  He seems like a special gentleman!!
Colorado is also known as the Centennial State.  We became a state 100 years after Declaration of Independence.
this video couldn’t help but make me smile. The state border shouting, Kara and Adele, van life again, wow idk it was good.
Kara and Nate 💕you are awesome 💕I watch your videos every time I go to bed you guys are awesome I love your video when I have a hard day you guys always cheer me up❤💕♥️💕
Just saw you guys in Durango. Good luck on the rest of your trip.
I love Adele too can’t believe it’s my favorite YouTubers favorite artist
Kara do you truly like Van life or not? I feel your recent videos are lacking excitement and are too long. The bike ride sounds dull, as you have other bike rides.
Colorado is the best
The guy next to you at the concert looked miserable 😂
Leadville, Colorado is home to the 100 mile marathon!
THEYRE BACK TO VANLIFE 👹
Oh my gosh, that was amazingggggg! I love Adele also, but I love you guys more lol. Can’t wait for this next adventure!
YAY!
Seeing peoples smiles at the top of any peak no Matter how difficult always brings me joy..
Mav looks like dusty 😂
#24 on trending guys!
Oh my goodness! Hays Kansas is an hour away from where I live and I ALWAYS go to Hays and I just keep thinking about how cool it would have been to run into you guys and give y'all a crisp high five!😂😭❤️
Do I also follow Naick and Kim. They're from Belgium, shipped their Ford van to the east coast of Canada, drove to Alaska, so they can do the pan American highway. Watching your adventures with your van makes me feel so much worse for them because they've been plagued with breakdown after breakdown and they have to get parts from Europe because the Western hemisphere doesn't carry the parts!

I got surf shark using your promo code!!!
This is going to be such great fun!!!!!  There will be sore bottoms, hopefully not too many spills, wrecks, or breakdowns (vans, bikes or people), and possibly some hijinks.
OMG I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY YALL MAKES ME MY BEST SELF I LOVE YALL SO MUCH
It's sad how much humans idolize other humans 😭 God is a jealous God! 🙏
Yay! I love your van life videos!
Do you know yet where you will be finishing?  Maryland?
I am from St. Louis Missouri 😊 I love watching your videos.
The shot of Dustie staring at Nate’s pancakes when he’s pouring syrup on them… hilarious 🤣🤣 you can tell he just rolled right out of bed
Welcome back to my home state since 1969! One of these days, I would sure like to show you my favorite spots. Oh, did I mention I just luv ya two! Been following for years, but didn't subscribe until way later. My bad. During covid, I power watched over 500 of your blogs & lived vicariously through all your travels, most of which I too visited. Be safe out there!
Lol “feels a lil loose” I love that you stayed at it too.
I miss these Van life videos! I’m glad we finally get a few episodes back in the van!
Was the concert in the sphere?
This is how I found y’all! In the van!!! Yay! I’m so excited!
So excited to see this upcoming adventure! I love when you guys van life. Especially when you have all your “family” with you! I’m living vicariously thru your videos! Have so much fun!
You guys should go visit Carmel beach in California and also Solvang, both so beautiful and worth to go. also, they have very yummy candies!! lots of cute shops and fun locations to visit.
Well I didn't think after all the other things you've done that this would be your greatest Adventure yet but I take it back.
If we were traveling together and you did that at every friggin' state line, I'd throw you out on the side of the road and then file for divorce.
You should come to New England for so fun fall weather I got places to tell you are the best!!!❤
Kara! Where is that adorable colorful stripe white jacket and pants set from!?
JELLY of your Adele experience, I’d sell my soul to see her, so excited to see your trip , love you guys 💜
I'm so happy yall are back to van life 😊good luck on your trip
Just love seeing Kara so happy at the concert!
I kept waiting for you all to say, we’re just kidding! Lol
We like what you've done w our logo ;) :)
Are you going to do Bike the Coast?
I love it that your friends have a whiteSolis Pocket just like me. Great video guys can't wait for the adventure😊
As a Coloradan I am just filled with pride with how much you guys like it here! ❤
Wow, this video felt very nostalgic. Your van life videos helped us all get through 2020 a little bit easier. Super excited for this upcoming series!
I CANNOT wait to see your video with Nate’s grandfather and their van trip🥹 he seems like the sweetest man ever!!🫶🏻🫶🏻
Omg! That Cracker Barrel is like 10 min from my house! I would have fan girled if I saw y’all.
As someone who got to see one of their idols this year, seeing Kara so happy and happy crying had my happy crying with her!! And reminded me of how I felt 💜 love you guys!!
Kara - please keep your feet on the floor not the dash 😊
They know they way to Kara’s heart is through Coffee and enough power to boil her water for said coffee. 😂❤
Shout out St. Louis!!! I’ve always thought about seeing your van while driving around lol
We love Kara!
I’ve been waiting for this!!!
13:25 - 13:30: Noticed that white van parked next to you as you left the parking lot was SUDDENLY in front of you on the freeway!!! Who are they and what are they doing travelling with you guys?????
Is it really back to van life? I bet money your going to do another bike trip…!
So excited for this next adventure x
There are small seasonal campground businesses who would really appreciate your 30 dollars.
colorado ftw!!!!!!!
I just want to say thank you ☺️ I’ve been unwell for a few weeks now, unable to go anywhere or even leave the house… and just when I was going stir crazy I stumbled onto your videos on FB… and have been binging them so much ever since cause I absolutely love them!! Your videos have really helped me to push through a really emotionally draining situation, the energy you both have is incredible and tangible, and I cannot wait to see even more! 🥰
Kara your british accent just cracks me up every time 😂😂😂😂
NOOOO SHOTTTT LETS GO
Seeing Kara crying and have the time of her life made this whole video worth it ❤️❤️❤️
Do a fan meet in Oceanside! I’ve been watching y’all for years would love to meet you two!!
Nates’ goofy cute grin when Kara is singing 💛 So excited for videos to come. Especially the one with pop. Seems like one could learn alot from a man like him
FHSU
WAIT NO WAYYY I WAS JUST REMEMBERING YESTERDAY THAT your vanlife series wAS SO COMFORTING
I love yall I've missed the van videos I've been watching yall for 5 years
We  have missed can life
Washington DC is 90 miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean.
yesssssss! Adele 1 you were listening to my favorite song I think.
Love how geeked Kara is to see Adele
We just got back from PowerTrip in Indio, CA. I would love for you guys to have been able to make that 3 day show in the van!  Iron Maiden, Guns and Roses day 1, Judas Priest and AC/DC day 2, and Tool and Metallica on day 3.  It would have been Epic to have had a Kara and Nate special from the desert 🤘🤟👍
My high school English teacher used to always say "I'm from Missouri", meaning he wanted us to "show him" (provide proof/references).  At first, of course, no one knew what the heck he was saying.  Then, he explained it.  So, I'll never forget that Missouri is "the Show me State".
Man you guys, I really like you until you started this in my state. Missouri is a proud state and show me means we don’t take anything for granted!
You were in Hays, KS! Home of Ft. Hays State University and the Tigers. Not too far from my neck of the woods!
OMG YES!!!! finally!!!!!! 😊
VANLLIIIIIFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!
Am I imagining things or was Nate in the thumbnail and now Kara’s in the thumbnail?
The shower head magnet situation was hilarious😂
Will you guys do a meet up again anytime soon? You guys want to Las Vegas and I would love to meet you since I live there. I have been a fan of yours since 2016.
Gosh, Tandem bike across USA sounds great, cant help but be concerned about the dangers of this! Be safe and as always! We love you and be careful ❤️
I checked the Adele concert tickets on StubHub... There are seats in that very section you were sitting in going for nearly $13,000. No entertainer in this crazy world of ours is worth parting with that amount of money. Sure hope you didn't pay that much
So many things about this video.... Love that the cardboard list is back! That dirt in the greywater tank and whatever was clogging it was gag worthy.  We've learned to not put much down the sink, not even toothpaste. Where is Kara putting black clothing?  I love the new looks. I love how much y'all love VanLife!  It is a special happy place for us too. So thankful for the instagram/FB updates.... Keep on keepin on!!!
Hii guys, I don't wanna intrude or be rude but today I'm very sensitive to sexism and I noticed that Nate said after the concert that "it was the best money I ever spent on Kara" and didn't understand it. Idk what's the situation of work in your relationship, but at least how it portraits you guys do seem to share the work. It doesn't seem fair for Nate to be dealing with with going to a concert like that. Men sometimes are so money oriented that they treat love like a currency.
I love that you're going back to the van!!!!
The smile on Nate’s face when Kara got excited was so cute as it shows his love for making her happy❤ love u guys xx ❤❤❤
Virgin River gorge!
My 12 year-old and I did almost this EXACT trip in our van just 2 months ago!! Drove St. Louis to near Joshua Tree for a Lovejoy concert, with stops in CO and Vegas for a day. So fun! Art show artist, the original vanlifers!  Have fun, safe travels. LOVE watching your adventures, you’re my most fav YouTubers❤ enjoy
i love your socks Nate can you put were you got the black and withe ones pleeeeeeeesas  thank you
Your all so crazy ! 😅😅😅❤❤❤❤ i love you all so much! 💓 ❤❤❤
The tiger mascot in Kansas was for Fort Hays State University.  You were probably stopped in Hays, Kansas most likely.  Any other Walmart in Kansas you would have seen Jayhawks & Wildcats.
Finally!!! I missed this!
Are y’all going to post updates at where your going to be biking through? I would love to see if you possibly would pass through my town!
Cracker Barrel >
The joy of Kara is INFECTIOUS!
I don't get all the suspense, people who have been following you guys on Instagram, knows what's up
I can't wait for your biking adventure across the state to begin. Wishing you guys all the best!
I always like when they chant the state that they’re going to
Bless Kara at Adele was adorable
I’m so happy for Kara. I’ve always wanted to see Adele in concert
I can’t believe y’all came through St Louis and I missed you😫 I live right off of that telegraph exit!!!
Only 30 days
Epic Kara and Nate❤️ love living through your adventures
Y'all I hope you have a fun challenge
Can't wait for all of it!
❤❤❤❤❤ you two are amazing! Xx
This is going to be a fun series!! :) I'm so confused, I'm from Utah and have never seen it called industry. It's always "Greatest Snow On Earth" or "The Beehive State".
I was so sure that the one word for Utah would be "polygamy" 😁
oh wow. 😯
BIKE ADVENTURE IS SOOOOOO EXCITING!!!!!!!!!!!! So happy for this vanlife comeback!
Hey now! Missouri is pretty dang... show me.. the pretty sights, compared to Kansas!
NUMBER 15 ON TRENDING LETSSS GOOOO
you guys are in my neighborhood San Diego
We just took a trip from Colorado to Provo Utah! Views sure look familiar
Your temporary return to van life has me grinning from ear to ear! Seriously, it's such a cool surprise. It's awesome to see you back on the road. I assumed that your extensive travels meant bidding farewell to the van for good. But, as they say, home is where the heart is, and it's clear that your hearts find joy in the open road.  Your journey has been an incredible source of inspiration, and your dedication to exploring the world and sharing your adventures has ignited a sense of wanderlust in me. Your authenticity and enthusiasm are as infectious as ever, and I'm excited to follow along on this unique chapter of your adventure!  Enjoy every moment of it! 🚐✨
It is so refreshing to see how much you guys are still loving van life especially since so many others are kind of retiring from it lately!
Thank goodness for power tools
Love you guys!!!! Gotta ask one question: How in the world did you get away with recording IN a casino? They are VERY against any photos/filming inside their premises. BTW: You were in my town, Las Vegas!!!
That definitely sounds like the ultimate cross-country road trip. Who needs a five-star hotel when you have a five-star sunset from your van window? This literally inspired me to explore the US. Well, I hoped my dart would somehow lands in the US.
WOW! WOW! You two are amazing! Hope you two have fun, you two are so inspiring!
❤❤❤
YESSSS THEY R BACKKK TO VAN LIFEE
edit:CONGRATS ON THE  usa trandemx2?? i guess well goodluck-luke
Colorado, admitted in 1876, is the Centennial State.
This is amazing!!  It’s crazy how big the girls are now!
7 mins in the vid and i thought yall were gonna be  parents but idk ill edit it later just in case
I love that y'all love Colorado!
its awesome that you saw Adele what a concert she is awesome live, glad that your starting another mad adventure
Can’t Love This Enough 😊
"Do what thy will"??..that's Aleister Crowley's teaching. What shall it profit a man to gain the whole world bt loose his soul?😢
No way was Baja 2 years ago!  I swear that was just last year.
I’m excited for the grandad one! Was hoping the bike trip  would be down the California coast since y’all didn’t get to drive it during Covid! I’m still waiting for that one!
FFS, I could swear one of you has my contact info, next time you need a place to park the van reach out, I have a few RV spots open for Youtubers at my place.
VANLIFE + ADELE = 🖤🖤🖤
Thank you so much for starting your EPIC adventure in Oceanside!! 🥰It looks like you're doing the Race Across American route that starts in Oceanside and ends in Annapolis! We'll be cheering you on from here! 🌊 Let us know if you ever want to participate in one of our many annual endurance events in O'side! 😉🚴‍♂🏊‍♂🏃‍♂
All this digging on our state slogan.   🤨 OUCH!  P.S. I still love y'all anyway.
As someone who used to live in Colorado and am from Ky, Kansas is one of the most boring states after Lawrence on I-70. Nebraska and Wyoming is up there too. Don’t ever leave Colorado for MT. Rushmore without food we were starving the whole way all there was were gas stations and subways. I will say to anyone traveling through the glenwood canyon on I70 watch out for the goats on the road I’ve about hit a few before the tunnel. I’m gonna try to make my way back out west in the spring hopefully since I miss living there.
When Kara cries, I cry!  🥹
I cried seeing Kara's crying! Seeing your favorite artist concert is one of the magic moments in life!!
This was one of the most entertaining shows.i love how they both get to do what they love and support each kther and respect each other's needs .
waaaaahhhh You guys are coming to Oceanside!!!!!
This is amazing.  And the entire cool crew with you?! IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING.
The fact that I have lived in Las Vegas for 12 years and you guys are just super excited to just enter Nevada and I am just like move me to somewhere else please.😂
May have already been noted but Washington DC is not on the Atlantic Ocean.  So if you are going to dip the bike tires into both oceans, you will need to extend your ride a bit further East.  Enjoy!
I have been praying for a chance to purchase a van!
A bit hurt that you guys were so close to Iowa, but didnt make it into Iowa... maybe someday...
Yayyy van life
You two must really like each other. Another amazing adventure!
I saw Adele back in august and it was fantastic! Can confirm it is worth the ticket price! Me and my sister went together and it was actually my first time in Vegas too, so lots of fun! I was def as excited as Kara. But we did buy our tickets months in advance 😂
I'm currently in the middle of watching through your Van Life videos from the pandemic for the first time and I was so excited to see this video pop up. Incredibly perfect timing I guess 😄 I was so happy when you hinted at meeting friends for a bike trip because I immediately knew you were talking about Rick and Bec. Can't wait to see them and their girls again! The "dads" on a tandem bike should be fun.
Just heard Oceanside and started SPINNING! My family owns La Costa Coffee in Carlsbad. My uncle Doug roasts coffee most days. Kara, you’ll LOVE the coffee and ambience
I am living for these long videos!!
As an Englishman,  that " take off " of Adele was very good, i must say.  Throw a few "fackins" in there,  ya'v nailed it !! PS. 20 mins in,   and all the while i'm thinking ya man reminds me of someone.    Yep, a young Jack Palance
Well, I guess Adele has one fan.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!! Can you do a meet-up in Washington, DC? Even something stealth on the DL (as the kids say today🤣🤣) that you just announce last minute on your Instagram? Lots of coffee shops available and if @Nate prefers he can go for a run and we'll reward him with donuts when he gets back!
Watching u do van life is especially fun! 🇨🇦 ❤
I cannot wait to see the van trip with your grandfather!  Make special memories .
I'm so excited to see the trip with your Grandpa! These next videos are going to be so fun! Can't wait to watch 😊
The guy sitting next to Kara at the concert was sleeping....to each his own.
I teared up with Cara when it first started showing her at the Adele concert so lucky and I think they’re going rafting
You guys are crazy!! Maybe I’ll see you as you pass through St.Louie! Good luck!
33:01 OptiVolt has solar panels AND coffee to send you?!?!  Are they a company founded for only supplying @KaraandNate when they are van-lifing? Because that's what their business model seems to be. 🤣☕🌞⛅
The most beautiful and also the scariest stretch on the I70 😂 don’t recommend getting caught in the snow up there 😅 I’ve almost had an incident 3 times driving safely
What about Mav? I guess he’ll be riding in one of the vans 🚐?
I enjoyed Vegas every one should visit
I was worried that being at a high altitude would make me sick but wasn't a problem.  But did not hike
I was on my first road trip in a truck from Cali to Wisconsin.
Nate can't wait to watch you and pops!!!!
Woww
Best video ever!!! Seeing Kara's excitement is so contagious I am just so freaking happy for her!!!
Love this!! Can’t wait to see the entire journey 😊
your adele moment was my counting crows moment... so glad u enjoyed!
kara and nate are my roman empire
I am not positive but I think biking across the US was one of the things you considered to do in 2020.
Y'all should collab with Mav
internation travel>200th van video
Van life is honestly my favourite thing you guys do😂 There is just something about it that i love so much. You guys are also easily the best van life youtubers🙌 Keep it up😁
How did they keep their dog cool in Vegas ??? When ya left the van - logistics
Me and my grandson are super big fans would love to know when u r crossing thru West Virginia so we can b there to cheer u on..
Getting beeped by your van.
I live close to we’re you guys stayed the night in Missouri.
Dont the kids need to go to school?
Kara earnt that concert from all the crazy adventures she does for Nate
I love you guys and Van Life! I didn’t know Sarah and Dusty had a van too!
Here I was thinking going from Nashville to la was so long but biking it all the way to d.c will be crazy. Please don’t stress your self with a certain time to finish and don’t stretch yourselves thin doing this challenge but you got this!
Van life once again whoop whoop.  You guys make the best videos when it comes to van life. I’m super excited for the next 6 weeks.
You should go to Pennsylvania
I love seeing Kara happy she deserves everything ❤
Yeeeeuw. Stoked!!!!
If you guys end this bike trip in Washington, DC you technically aren’t going to be dipping your bike wheel in the Atlantic Ocean, you would have to extend your journey across the Chesapeake Bay and the Eastern Shore of Maryland to get to the Atlantic Ocean.
I love Adele!!!
You were so happy when she started singing at her show
@14:40 I always thought that Colorado was the Rocky Mountain state. 😮
Great job on the video folks! Thanks for making it.
Top tier
nice video! I saw your post on instagram fo I had a clue while watching! lol .... Love it great job guys, can't wait for the whole video!
Kara crying when seeing Adele in concert..... if "pure joy" was a person.❤❤❤❤
I am so glad you came back to this type of adventure. Van Life is my favorite. ❤❤❤
Good morning from Minnesota!! Great episode!!
I can’t wait to see Pop and his van. I remember the video when we first met him and the van.  Epic
These videos remind me just how huge the US is. If you drove for 10 hours in any direction in the UK, you'd end up in the sea!
Dear Kara,  every one on the internet knows that you cant poop without coffee
My Brother and Sister in law live in Oceanside!!!!  So cool!
Born and raised in Oceanside! Hope it treated you all well❤
Omg
I usually sit and wait for your videos.  We have had such q scary qnd sad few days i kinda felt guilty watching something that makes me so Happy.  Today i needed a break from the news thank you for being dependable and so uplifting.  Watching from Israel with q broken heart🇮🇱.  😢😢😢
You two are so cute. I look forward to all your adventures - be safe out there.  I'm jumping right on to the video with your granddad - being an owner of a 73' VW myself (her name is Daisy), I'm sure I'll love that video.
adele sucks , but the up coming bike trip across will be good for a laugh !
Do you guys still talk with Eamon and Bec
Fabulously fun video guys...love your chants on each change of states! Great work Mr.Handyman Nat! The joy of seeing Adele.....full terrific Video. Thanks guys ❤
I am so excited for this adventure...LOVE all your videos but these adventure ones makes me so excited
Is it just me or does Nate's hand writing look wayyyyy too neat. My teachers could barely see what I was writing 😅😅
Yayyyy!!!!!!
Love your videos, I would have loved to have seen your trip from Australia back to America.
Crazy idea
Adele is rolling in the deep and Kara and Nate is rolling in the van, and I am here for it <3
Make sure to lock tight those solar panels! Ours almost flew off recently because the screws loosened 🙃
Hopefully your end point is somewhere other than DC or you can't dip your wheel in the ocean cause you'll be pretty far away. You can dip it in the harbor and pretend it's the same since the bay feeds to the ocean but technically it's not the ocean.
Wow! What an epic adventure! 🚲 looking forward to the next videos! ❤❤❤
I love your videos ❤🎉there back Yayay xx
Van life are my FAVOURITE videos…. they feel so comforting to me. I’m glad you guys are back on the road!
Kara and Nate 👌 Much love from Botswana 🇧🇼
Sometimes great experiences are about the people you are with rather than the locations you go.  Van life is a perfect example of that 👍👍
seeing Kara happy makes me happy, honestly love you both so much!
Aww so good to see the van again, this next challenge is insane haha love it ❤
Once you said Leadville I knew who you were talking about,  can’t wait for your next adventure!!
I love watching you guys! Your energy and happiness is contagious and brings  me so much joy to watch. Reminds me of the fun times I had when I was your age. Thanks so much you guys xx
Ahhhh! You were just a few miles away from my apartment!  So glad you had a blissful Adele experience ❤😊
Recently i miss bike adventure of you guys. Cant believe this happen again. Cant wait fot the next video 🎉
Kara & Nate both have great teeth!
Looking forward to the video with your pépère Nate. I miss mine so much and any little or big adventure together will always be the best memories. ❤
I didn't know just how much I missed van life!
😁👍🧡
Thanks for the heads up on the next video. I'll make sure not to watch at work so no one sees me cry. I miss my grandparents.
all is ok apart from calling out  the dam states  ok
GREAT ADVENTURE - hmm In Vegas did you stay at the Bellagio? Looked like you were racing through to Caesars Palace. Hope you did its a great Hotel and so convenient to everything, your next Adventure sound fantastic, have fun and stay safe ❤️🙏🏻THANK YOU BOTH for sharing this great trip you are on 🍾🥂👏🏻🙏🏻❤️🇦🇺🙋🏻‍♀️
The concert of Adele was the best part of this video! Can't wait for the videos on your new adventure, and the one with your grandfather, love it! 🥰
I love the Kara me day. Here is to many many more KARA days . Yippee xxxx
Netflix has blocked VPNs. You can’t watch anything with a VPN active in the background. So maybe change your ad :)
I went to Adele,  Brisbane, Australia.    One of the best concerts ever.
Yay back to home . Xxxx
hey guys Palisade is also known for their fantastic peaches,
Well at least one of my favourite YouTubers are not giving up van life yay ! Loving the Friends Easter eggs.
Whats them sunglasses nate is wearing?
Too much traveling!!  Gotta follow college football!!! mizzu Tigers at that walmart!
finally!!!! 😍
I LOVE that “chant” sort of thing that you did when you got to another state! I thought it was really cute! 🤗🤗❤❤
Would both of you try van life in another country?
Woah, it’s really been 2 years since van life!?
Nate dog you said colorado slogan is better than missouri show me slogan!?!
You guys should make one of your adventure with spoon river drive in Illinois or the 400 miles yard sale in KY both very fun
Be safe on your long trip.
kara was so happy
$90 for 20 gals blows my mind being from CA. Great Vid!
Actually cant wait for this one, it's gonna be packed with great moments, it's gonna be long crazy good ride haha. Good Luck to all of you guys!
I am so excited for all of the upcoming videos and adventure that are going to come for you guys.
It's the little things in life, and to remember to cherish the time and adventures you share together. Always a good day when you guys post a video, my excitement level for this next adventure is the same as how Kara felt when seeing Adele.
OMGGGG i live so close to oceanside i hope to see you guys out here !!! your guys energy is my absolute favorite safe travels !!!
00:19 What the actual hell??!  😂😂
I want to see this trip with "Pop". I want to see this trip that is a family legacy. The Buchanan legacy. Maybe this is an award you can give to subscribers who have a great family vacation (Pops vacation, pops challenge, etc.). Ya'll are some of my favorite people. I'm glad you had a great vacation and family time regardless.
Nate: "Are we just driving our van down the Vegas strip?!" 14 years ago my husband & I & our three kids drove down the Vegas strip in a 26 ft RV.😂
Aw, Kara, I'm so happy you got to see Adele! It made me cry seeing you cry because you were so happy.
Kinda don’t like the mustache
missed van life
I am sooooooooooo soooooooo happy you guys are back to vanlife for awhile I love your life ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I enjoy your your Van Life and excursions far more than all the others.
love this karas hair is so cute
Kara/Nate, your vids, "set Fire to the Rain"✌
You might have trouble finding the Atlantic Ocean in Washington DC.
Ocean to Ocean   😎👍🇦🇺
LOVE seeing you back in the van and with your adventure group! More Sarah and Dusty and Rick and Fam!
Hope you  enjoy your selves 34:55
i know yall never stay at campgrounds, but it might be a bit cool to see how they operate and amenities available. especially the nice ones
I am only 5 minutes out but is it hiking the PCH?
Best of Luck for your adventure.
I would love to see an Adele concert too, but the tickets are ridiculous. :(   I can’t wait to see the video with Nate’s grandpa. This should be fabulous!
Why not have babies and settle down for a while....
Does Dusty and Sarah have their own channel? I wanna see the layout of their van! Love u both and Goodluck on your adventures ❤
The gray water tank is not gray 3:18  it brown 3:30
Remove the old panels to increase efficiency and reduce potential problems.
new bike trip???
Excited for the camping w pops video. But after the monkey run shenanigans I cannot wait to see how this one goes. Omg. Y’all are hilarious💜
24:09 Nate was so zoned out by Kia hours like he was focused you had a mission to ignore all of her singing and laughing I could never .  Nate gets the award for the best husband of the year
Is it Tour de France
Have you washed the coffee maker tho :P XD ?
So excited for the clues, love Kara chilling back at the van😂❤
So glad you got back in the van

I hope I see you guys. Because I’m sure your going to be going through flagstaff on I-40.
As much as I love the wild adventures, I already know the Nate & Gramps adventure is going to be my favourite of all time! 💕
Hey you guys are the reason I am smiling today thank you❤
So excited for these future posts coming 🥰
I've been warchung hardest geezer, thanks to your mention. And was literally thinking you guys should do an run across America. But we'll take biking! Can't wait to watch. Ya'll are my favorite.
YAASSSS!! I have been waiting for the trip with Grandpa! I'm so excited!!❤🎉
10 million subs fter the bike ride. thats gona be beyond epic
I felt exactly the same as Kara when I saw Adele. I laughed, I cried, I squealed and I sang at the top of my voice. It was amazing.
what a bike ride? goodness. gonna be peaceful
As a Hays, Kansas native, it made me happy to see the quick shoutout and just so you know, it is the Fort Hays State University Tigers!
OMG!!! I love you guys! I so wish I knew that you were in Las Vegas 😮. A fan meet up would've been awesome. I know that you had limited time. I'm so happy Kara loved Adele😁. Be safe, and keep up the great videos ❤️🙏.
I live in Washington DC omg omg🥹😱
WHEN I SAW THIS THUMBNAIL I GOT HYPED. I’ve never been so excited for a video
great job on defeating the parking slugs
fux i wanna see the camp ground in hades
nnnot adele with the sour starbucks cup
Utah’s motto is “life elevated”
I trust you will be wearing those biking shorts with the Cush butt stuff built in.
Some people film the artist at concerts. Nate films Kara, the real star!!
no wondr nate lost his spark. going to see adele. unsubed jk
van life videos are my FAVORITE videos to see on this channel. THANK YOU.
nates gonna point out all the moountains he climbed in colorado on a peak, gonna be a long boring video. Nates 43 mountain climbing how to
whats that rent a dog?
kara is looking amazing. Nate pick it up
YES!!! I was re-watching the bike series yesterday and said to myself how awesome it would be if they did another adventure with the vans! Kara must be psychic!
Im getting Gabby Petito vibes ..
I'm confused - the big announcement.  We already heard about the whole three person bike journey on a previous video.  Am I missing something??
Hearing you yelling out as you pass into each new state reminded me of car trips with my parents (SO many years ago).  Each time we would enter into a new state, my parents would say to each other "I love you in .........".
who tf is that korn looking boy in the green bib longhair starring at the syrup. hilarious
omggg cant wait !!!
Love Adele !
You two are so sweet you make me cry.  I love you too.  And Nate...you're a great hubs.  :)
Glad you didn't stop in Indiana. You'd all never leave, get a union job, and end up on medication with no hope. Welcome home
Utahs slogan is actually “life elevated” 😊
When was this first uploaded?
Hope you two didn’t stay in the places they said bed bugs took over. Idk. Maybe not as bad as Paris France. I’m not an Adele fan. BUT the memory that is precious is this past year. My spouse after he retired we did lot in Vegas that my parents took care of our kids. And the one place I cried was watching the blue man group. ONLY because I remember when I was young I’ve always wanted to see them. And finally in my 30s I saw them.
5 times longer sounds right. If one thing is easy the next is ten times longer. Union double time pay so it's ok
Are yqll hiking the pct?
I love you guy❤
Oceanside!!? Welcome to my city!!😊❤
please tell me you have bear spray!
Hope Dusty & Sarah have their own YT channel
Where can I get Kara’s laptop tray? Would be great for work from home.
THIS MADE MY WHOLE DAY .. I’M SO EXCITED !
You should of got Ryan @duzer he can pedal.
That was dirt but not any dirt. It a mud dobber nest.
OMG!!!! I miss these videos so much, and I have watched your van life series from two years ago so many times. You should start travelling the US again. That was my favourite thing to watch ever. Love you guys  Edit: 16:04 sounds like he is talking about the bike trip 2 years ago. Man it brings back memories. 🥲🥲🥲
I teared up seeing how excited kara was seeing Adele. 🎉🎉❤❤🎉🎉
I live in carlsbad! I love that you’re in Oceanside!
Wow time flies. 🔥🆙
Ermagawsh! I'm sooooooo excited for the video with pop! ❤
I'm can't believe the tire is staying inflated.😊
Loved every minute of this.  Thank you for consistently sharing your experiences with us.
yeah, not too impressed
Would have loved to had met you in Hays Kansas! I watch you every night before I sleep. My husband and I have been inspired to do van life when we retire!!
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS 🎉
😂 love this!
Did you guys pick up the cardboard you throughout of the van…?
I prefer the van, but I have solar panels on my roof.
❤️❤️❤️
so so so many likes for kara fangirling! Love this roadtrip so far!
Here for the return of Van life!!! Yay!!!
Kara and Nate IDK if you can see this but about the 13 minute mark we can all see Dusty's license plate for a couple of seconds before you blur it out. I don't know how important that is but I thought I'd point it out. <3
Why did you guys decide to go vegan/pescatarian? I know that you've eaten fish, was it for survival? Just wondering.
I guessed you were riding the PCH this is bigger!
After the pandemic, this NOT being because of the pandemic is a special thing. It's like it's come full circle. It's like I get to revisit all the memories of that time, but with some full circle positivity.  Yay!
Such a cool experience Kara and Nate. Would be cool if in each state you all do a quick meet up with fans.   Understandable though if you all want to do the journey without all the stops, just an idea! Have a blast and reminds me of Ragbrai across the U.S! 😊
You guys should go to Santa Monica and just enjoy the food trucks, Disney Land, and the beach. Kara deserves that. From Vegas, you're about 3-4 hours away. You guys are the greatest. Thank you for spreading your sunshine. Love you bunches. Be safe and have fun.
Im so sad you stop less than 5 miles from my house in that Cracker Barrel parking lot😢😢😢❤
Love your international travel videos but i am SO EXCITED that you guys are in the van again 🤩
I grew up in Glenwood Springs, and have to agree, it's a gorgeous canyon. Y'all need to hike to Hanging Lake the next time you're through there. :)
Love Oceanside C.A........i miss that place😢
Yay!!
I’ve never seen kara this happy and i am literally crying along with her 😭
Nate's face while Kara singing at 24:08 has me dying
Not them stopping in my town ❤❤
I would love to meet you guys when you come to colorado 😊
Kara and Nate thinking they're doing something illegal 28:03
FU from the show me state!😀
kara you had me in tears when you said WERE GONNA SEE HER DO THAT ❤  that excitement was everything
I LOVE KARA AND NATE VANLIFING!💜
Another great adventure, enjoy going through life with you both😊
Colorado girl here and raised in Colorado....still never tire of Glenwood Canyon
That WalMart was in Hays, KS. I attended Fort Hays State University there. I noticed the Tigers and Western Kansas. (Middle of BFE)
Haha, I accidentally parked in the employee lot @Caesar palace on NYE taking my wife to see Celine Dion in 17...  Best night ever.  Watching this brought it all back, because we drove from Michigan.    Employee behind me let me out so other than embarrassment, it cost me $0.00  So glad you had a great experience too.
van life k&n is my favorite k&n 🤩 so glad y’all are back!
I have never liked a video quicker!!
I am from St Louis… there are pretty areas… hwy 70 not so much! I love the rolling plains of Colorado!
Oh my gosh: that campsite is on BLM land, just outside the White Rim Trail.  We camped there a few years ago, and it was indeed THE BEST campsite ever.  (We're from Nashville, now live in Salt Lake).  :-)
Next time coming through Missouri come through Kansas City Home of the #Chiefs 🏈 ask us where you need to Go and See !
You lost me when you said you're going to Ca......
Adele is so not my type of singer. I barely know any of her songs, but I can appreciate Kara's excitement. Good for her. It's great to have that type of passion for something. You guys are great. Always so upbeat. It definitely helps my mood.😊
Yeah I already knew what the adventure was due to following you on Instagram.
Yay! Back to the van! It’s about time.
Another great video😊. But Nate, please shave the mustache😂
Yay van life vlogs are back ! 🥹😻 I love these!!
Missouri 😂 stop on by we'll give you a beer 🍻.. you know you're in Missouri when there's a Cracker Barrel haha. ✌🏼
Things I love about this vid: VAN LIFE VLOGS ARE BACK! The bits about "show me state" and the state mottos. ALSO Kara + Adele!!! Too good. Excited for the bike adventure vids!!
Hey guys, I noticed there’s a quick scene in the Cracker Barrel parking lot where dusty and Sarah’s license plate is not blurred
ooooff 100 miles/day will be murder on non-regular-riders!
Not sure who was happier, Kara seeing Adele or Nate hacking the overnight parking! Love you guys!
The Endless Adventure stayed at that Vegas site earlier this year.
Wishin you'd do land trips in Cebu Philippines, soon 🥺🫶🫶
So glad to see you back in the van. I love how such seasoned World Travelers are still so excited about crossing State lines. At what point did you realize that DC is NOT on the Atlantic Ocean?
I can’t wait to see your trip with Gramps. My Grandfather’s were the best.
When Nate was shouting “I did it” it sounded like Adele’s singing “I could looooovvee you in the dark” 😂
I love watching you two tackle the problems of life. From parking in Vegas to solar panel work. Lol. Never gets old!
Van life videos are one of my favorites 😊
I’m so excited for you guys. And I know you won’t see this but I went to Washington DC yesterday
Great video, but three ad breaks. Wah.
I love ❤️ Adele too Kara!!!…❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Omg you guys stayed at the Cracker Barrel in St. Louis, right next to my house!!! Dang that would have been so cool if we crossed paths!!
omg its been so long.
so cool! best wishes
F.Y.I.  Back in the day (70's - 80's), Circus Circus was the place to bring your RV and the whole family to.I was the one of the only places where the whole family could enjoy Vegas.
Are you guys biking on 54 Hwy in Missouri …the show me state?
Adele concert was the best thing of my life
When are you guys coming to Wisconsin!! Would love to have you in the bicycling capital of America!!
It’s called a residency.
Being on your instagram makes this activity easy to guess
I can't wait to see this adventure! I hope you come back to RAGBRAI in Iowa again!
You all are nuts. Good luck and have fun!
Weekend with Adele was a fabulous concert!  I cried too!
the way i said “i hope they come to the nashville area! maybe i’ll see them!” and that’s where you guys started… idk if i should be happy or sad😭 do a meet and greet when you get back! ❤
As usual, you put a smile on my face
As someone who lives in Ohio I am so excited to know you are visiting! But it’s going to be chilly when you get here 😂🎉❤
Looking forward to the bike trip! I rode from LA to Boston earlier this year with my father. It was a truly fantastic experience and we're planning to do it again in another couple of years. I hope yours was just as much fun.
Me my mom,dad and sister when to the Adel concert on Friday we would have seen you guys If we went on Saturday why
Will you come to Virginia  .   We can do a meet up.     Harriet, Jim and Yuki   Richmond, Va.
Love you guys! Please be extra careful! I was just hit by a vehicle as a pedestrian, don't go through Kentucky, no offense but they can't drive! And don't know the laws!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Love it
Fried TOFU sandwiches are also the bomb
I was always told that Missouri is the Show Me state because we're stubborn.  The state animal is a mule, after all.  We won't just believe anything, you have to prove it.  Show Me!
Cuando dijeron América, pensé que se referían al continente, no a Estados Unidos. Ya me Imaginaba esa travesía de años xD
I just started watching you guys only and only because of van life in covid times… And now again i will start watching you guys coz of van life.
you have to go to the ocean in Md past DC to dip the bike in the Atlantic Ocean
Wow🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
can't wait for the pan american highway trip from Alaska to Argentina!
So, so cute, Kara !!!!  Yes, Adele !!
YAAAAAAYYYYYY! KARA AND NATE ARE BACK IN THE VAN!!!!!!!! OMG! I missed your Van Adventures SOOOOO MUCHHHHH!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐🚐
KARA I ALSO DONT LIKE PANCAKES IVE NEVER MET ANYONE ELSE AND ADELE IS MY FAV OMG
I love getting to see adventures with members of the expanded Buchannen Cinematic Universe. This is going to be such a fun trip!
SO EXCITED TO SEE THIS YEAR'S BIKE TRIP!!!
Note The parts you got "slide nuts" They also make "drop in nuts" you wouldn't have had to remove the rails.🙂 Just information if you have to mount something else. Peace
I'm so bummed Adele's residency ends in a few weeks!!!  It just didn't work out that I could make it and seeing Kara makes me more bummed that I won't get to experience it!
I love how excited you were or Adele!!!!
Guess you got bit by the cycling bug at RAGBRAI.
I have some time off and so I’m going back and watching the episodes I haven’t watched. I’m still in the part of the videos where they had the cup of coffee at the start of the video. Who knew I would miss seeing a cup of coffee at the start of a video.
watching Kara singing hello by adele made me cry it was so beautiful
Looks like your biking past our winter campground. S-22, Ocotillo Wells, CA.
As a Missourian I am jokingly offended that you thought show me state but secretly I agree that it is boring 😂 15:00
I wish I could hit the subscribe button an infinite amount of times, y’all are amazing
I grew up in Utah so that was so heart warming that my fav YouTubers passed by it prob 100 times!!!!!
I’m laughing at the pure cinema that is Kara’s me day vs Nate’s treacherous hike/ climb.
If you stop in PHX you gotta come to the scott resort and spa!!!
I’m even closer to Joshua Trees.  I love SoCal. We have deserts, mountains and ocean. ❤❤❤
Wait for the fine in the mail🤣🤣🤣
As a live long Missourian, I'm gonna have to stop watching you all. There's more in Missouri than many other states.
I feel like not only us but they would thoroughly enjoy shipping the van across the world to like any country to do van life over there. it would be a whole new experience
I love your excitement in seeing her, but if I'm totally honest, she's one of the few artists that I will actively turn off.  He music is like listening to cats being tortured to me.  Sorry Kara!
Thats awesome yall are crazy heck ya cant wait to see next week. yall happy safe travels
Always “Colorful Colorado”!     Pike’s Peak or bust came about with the gold rush, then for settlers moving West.
I hope you continue van life those are my favorite videos❤❤ love yall❤❤❤❤❤
YES! We love the van! Can’t wait to follow this big adventure.
I have to insert my own opinion because EEEEEEEEKKK- as an Adele fan myself I was sooo excited for you both…but to see Kara brought to actual TEARS, made me tear up as well!!! And Nate is the sweetest guy ever, doing everything to help Kara live out her GOALS! Love love love these two so much- best teammates and couple EVER! Look forward to more adventures with you guys! 😘
Can we send this to Adele so they can collab? 😂
awesome so glad we're back to vanlife I'm excited for the next few videos especially with nate Nate and his grandfather with his cool car also I lost count how many times kara said: I love Vanlife
Looking forward to this adventure, wish I could give 3 👍 up
lmaoo biking across America??? at some point, a human has to say "this is enough..this is too much" 😂
I got tears seeong Kara cry😭
Fort Hays State University Are the Tigers Kansas Native Here
Watching Kara’s complete joy at the concert is everything! May every person feel that full of happiness
Have kara and Nate been in ky?
Omgsh! That is my local Cracker Barrel and I live like 3 mins from there! So wild to see that on the video lol. Hope the short amount of time you spend in our Show Me state was good! ❤
Love seeing you guys back in the van! ❤
Every time Nate fixes something I prepare myself for a NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Awesome! I recognized ALL of those video clips from your past. Guess I'm a huge fan, eh? Looking forward to this trip - it's gonna be great.
It's been a while after flying around the world but now, you guys are doing on a road trip 😊 I hope you guys are enjoying the best life. 😊
Y’all crazy. 😂❤
Was the same seeing u2 in Brisbane
Do you have an update on the goal to visit every state? Will you tick off some more on this journey?
I love Oceanside !!! Have fun
Lol van life never really goes away does it,
Someday I'd like to see you two travel The Loop. It's a boat trip along the East Coast, inland through the Great Lakes and down rivers to the Gulf of Mexico. Maybe one of your fans has a boat and planning on the trip and willing to let you join them from time to time.
Not you stopping at my alma mater for college! Also, my alma mater for high school! Go State!
Best REI commercial ever! We got all our camping supplies from their when I was growing up.
Check out Dicot Designs we are a van builder in Boulder CO! We both lived van life so we know the ins and outs and try to make it accessible to everyone!
the guy next to you at the concert.... hilarious.. not as into it as Kara
I think they're going to do the PCT. One of the three for the triple crown.
Utahs slogan used to be “Life Elevated” I didn’t know it was changed.
I don’t think anyone has ever said Kansas with as much as excitement as you guys lol
lol Im so happy for ya to see Adel for real u have eaten bugs, desert island , spiders, lions and bears. Nate ya did good kara you get it girl. so jelly but definitely so happy for ya. work hard play harder
You should never touch a Halogen Bulb whist installing it (use gloves our install using a soft rag)  . The oil on your fingers will make the bulb super heat.. You will be re .. replacing it soon :) Less of course it is an LED. then in that case touch away ;)
Glenwood Canyon bridge:  my uncle helped build it and it is such a part of Home to me as I grew up in Western Colorado and travel there at least once a year!  I’m 74. I have lots of stories!
I've been following along on Instagram! I was so excited for you to make this video!
Ahhh the Circus Circus. You’ve made the classy choice. 🎩
Kara and Nate have y’all been sky diving yet 🤔
Nate, shave the stache! 😂
Wow i saw you guys just out side of Prescott arizona when i was heading out for a bike ride 35:26
Omg so excited for the video with pops!   Ive been waiting for this since yall worked on his van a couple years ago!
29:20 im pretty sure an actually room at Circus Circus is literally $9 a night on off nights haha
Loved this episode. Can't wait to see the upcoming videos w the whole crew, I've missed them!!
As I was watching you chant from state to state…I was thinking about crossing Texas on Interstate 10.  You ain’t doing that in a day*.  * OK, you can do it in one very long, very miserable day. But you don’t want to.
Omgomgomg
Oh my, I’m really close to Oceanside. I’m in Riverside County, right off the I-10.
Wow can’t believe how long it’s been! Cant wait to see all the upcoming adventures
omg that is so exciting! I can't wait to see this footage of the surprise!!!
I know this doesn't belong on this thread but thank G*D you guys are not in Israel or plan on traveling to that area!!!
I love Adele too! I live in Petaluma, CA, great River town, and we have lots of great restaurants and wineries and hikes here in Sonoma county! I wish you luck on your next adventure… And hope it’s not on a bike! We sailed and hung out by Alcatraz Island yesterday … your  favorite place…. to watch the blue Angels yesterday over the bay. We have a place for you to park if you’re interested in Petaluma.
I too am an Adele fan or freak.  Love her. Never seen her live but maybe someday! I’m so glad you saw her. I acted just like you when they Televised her concert from California maybe last yr. Loved this video!😊❤
Im from san diego. and im half way thru the show. ya getting the family pick up. Cute kiddos and alll i keep thinking if ya going to O>B are ya swimming to catilina islands? lol or are ya going to the military base camp pen. crazy who knows?
For some mysterious reason, even bringing awesome episodes to this channel before, the Colorado series has been the best content that Kara & Nate has EVER made😎The synergy between their awesome Colorado friends, their family and them it’s hard to beat👍
geez, bashing on one of the best states in the country, aka the "Show Me" state. Missouri has some of the cheapest fuel prices in the country and is home to former president Harry S. Truman.
Wondered where you two have been😅
So much fun watching this video! You guys never disappoint with your adventures! Wishing you all a safe trip!
The Utah state sign slogan is "life elevated "
Nothing like 37 minutes of kara and nate❤
I saw Adele in Brisbane and it was the best concert I’ve ever been too.  I grabbed all of the little paper messages that floated down at the end and put them into a painting, titled Adele’s true essence, it is semi abstract.  It looks fantastic and has an amazing vibe to it. ❤❤❤
I KNEW IT. Yet funniest thing about this is that my mom actually did this! She loved it! I hope you have a great time! And hydrate! It gets very hot through the journey.
If your going to be traveling in your Van again, you need STARLINK. It works everywhere.
Good luck
Kara GIRL, you are the same with Adele as I am with BTS!!!  Concerts are definitely my thing!!
I'm so so excited to see such a special video of Nate and Pops. I already know I'm going to cry over such a cute and wholesome video!   This journey is going to be epic and I was jumping for joy when I saw the title 🎉
I loved the montage 😂
Love the friends references: the one with…. ❤️ I missed van life so Yayyy!
Soooooo jelly that you got to see Adele. I would have loved to gone with someone who loves her like I do!  Side note:  I think y'all were getting mixed up with the state nicknames and mottos. 😂
Kara is the sweetest 😊
Kara wasn’t a vip at the concert.. not a close seat.
"When we are in the van we use public wifi!"  *Fam busts out Starlink* 😂
By the time you get over to the east coast it’s gonna be snowing.
Ok my goshhhhhh love it❤❤❤❤❤❤
You really need to try the Southern Part of Missouri!!! Ozark Mountains. Ozark National Scenic Riverways, Springs, Mills, National Forests!!! So much to do!
I am most excited to see the van trip with Pop
YAYAYA I LOVED YOU VAN LIFE SO I AM EXCITED
OMG OMG OMG!!!
Kara, they can't ALL be the best day ever.
Yaaaaaay
I am so glad you guys are finally finally finally doing Vanlife. Because it’s about time. Please do more than life besides six weeks of travel.  You should do a like your long travel with the van with those extreme adventures. Because there’s so much fun to watch.
I hope I go back to Arizona in December 😊 it's so beautiful there
Wish Nate wouldn’t talk about cost of things……you are no longer struggling financially 🤨
I literally was just think how much I missed van life and here we are they are in the van so excited
Lol... I have never seen Kara so excited! So glad that you guys got to go see Adel! I guess the new Sphere was not open yet. My friend and her husba d from Orange county, California went to see U2 at the Sphere! Yoi will have to go see it is you go back that way again! Of course you are in the best state, California!
Couple goals/ life goals ❤ love y'all
Love seeing Kara so happy lol and how Nate looks at her. Ugh oops I kicked my spouse off the bed 😂
28:30 - that advertising right there was worth their 12 dollars that they didn't fine you.
Number eight, shave
As a sympathy cryer, my eyes were watering watching Kara cry 😭😂💕
DC will only get you Chesapeake Bay. You'll need Virginia Beach, Ocean City Maryland, New Jersey or other coastal towns for the Atlantic official. Route 50 goes from West Sacramento, CA to Ocean City, MD and there's a mileage discrepancy depending on which coast you start from. Have you considered a meet up when you get here for your East Coast fans?
NATEEEE I WAS EATING!!!  Grey water tank grossness!!
No way. Kara won’t make it.
Really enjoyed all your Van Life videos, so excited to see you back in your tiny mobile home.
the van life era was peak Kara and Nate if you ask me, so glad to see you guys back!
Hey hey woah woah hey. Missouri is the Gateway to the West! Our official slogan is "Let the welfare of the people be the supreme law", roughly. It's translated from Latin
Thoughts as I watch:  1. Beginning this I’m glad I saw the email and already know 😄 2. I love and followed originally because of the international travel but I’m excited to see this adventure. 3. I was confused about dusty and Sarah for a minute but realized there’s another van lol. 4. I’ll be shocked if you two don’t end up settling in Colorado one day. When you guys chose to do Everest base camp, you started something that y’all had no clue would lead to this.  5. Kara deserves the vegas show. 6. Circus circus is not my ideal vegas location but I’m glad you guys stayed so close to some of the amazing places on the strip and hope everybody got to really experience the vegas strip! Wish/hope you had done Fremont st…
Kara and Nate have you named the van yet? I feel it is only fitting to name her “Adele” now that you have actually seen Adele in concert while traveling in her!
Damn !!!
Heyy I really hope y’all see this … IT IS CERY VERY DANGEROUS TO HAVE YOUR PROPANE TANK IN AN ENCLOSED BOX!!! My friends wife died of an explosion because this was equipped like this in their Airbnb!!!  Please don’t do that!!!!
You two are great, thank you
AWW, Kara, when I seen you cry it reminded me of how I felt when Oprah came to Toronto, Canada. I even named my cat Harpo (Oprah backwards, lol), so I know that feeling. So glad you could check this off your bucket list. XOXO I love Adele too, her personality is everything.
Yay! I missed van life
Anyone else miss them yelling out the states
Welcome to Joshua Tree! Love you guys.
Kara at the Adele concert was the absolute best part of this video and the entire video was amazing, (as they always are)!
Kara, you are MY style! You go, grrl. 😁
Calling out the states names 🙄🤫🤫
Could you imagine being the man sitting next to Kara at the concert( and I don’t mean Nate)! LOL🥰👂👂🗣️ Sorry Kara.😉💞
There is just something about nostalgic about your van life.  I love it.
Why doctor you have bikes?
oh my gosh, you guys if you ever come to Vegas again and don’t say hi I will be so sad but I’ll keep watching forever. You guys are the best and I have been watching your channel for years now I’m so happy to see you guys are out and about and driving around - but if you ever want somewhere to park that van in Vegas, you guys are welcome to park at our house.
Yay! Van life returns!
A lot of the Walmarts here in Missouri no longer allow over nights. They were being over run by homeless people camping out.
Yay!  Van life!  Welcome home… to the van I mean. 😂
Your state crossings reminded me of a road trip we did in 2014. I underestimated the time it would take to drive between Ohio and Iowa, especially with our fun stops and ended up with the late driving shift. At one point there was a bridge construction project on a state border area and we also had basically no signal to get new directions. So, I was trying to follow detour signs that had fallen in a storm I guess. We repeatedly crossed the border back and forth and I kept waking my husband up to do what had previously been our fun celebrations. We ended up laughing and it made what otherwise was pretty stressful a little more fun.  Oh and it's always so funny to see Kara's cooking and remembering the smoked salmon fiasco.
Oh circus  circus ...... yikes
I love van life!!!!! Glad it’s back! And always love your adventures with those peeps
I physically and audibly gagged at the grey water plug. Hubs is wondering why.
Love seeing my home state of Colorado… and my current state of Nevada. Though moving the southern rout to Nevada took 24 hrs (Murphy’s law) so I enjoy seeing the good route. Also there is a road near the Kansas border named after my surname so that’s fun. Also if you’re traveling glenwood stay at the hotel Colorado sometime. It’s rustic, it’s old, it’s possibly haunted. Get dinner at the Pullman. If your not being vegan or vegetarian at the time just ask for the specials. Elk meatloaf, cherry devild eggs. It’s always good. Also for future reference, Bellagio I believe has oversized parking. Or south point has some oversized you just have to get the limited spots and Uber your way to the strip.
SOOOOO proud of you for taking a ME day!!! In order to have what you need in the tank for the next big adventure, storing up energy mentally and physically and psychologically is a must. Good on you.
WOW I'm so so so so so excited for y'all oh my goodness!!!
i cried so many times in this video bc yall are just so sweet and i love watching your videos <3
If you guys are in a populated area during Halloween you should give out candy to trick or treaters! 💖
I was waiting for the video of Adele being to take her belt off!  It was such a Kara moment!
I love kara's fan girl ing for Adele
you can't reach the atlantic ocean from washington dc; you'll have to go to virginia or maryland
The fact that you guys literally filmed my local water tower when you stayed at Cracker Barrel is insane to me😂
1:09 im not sure it’s dirt bud 😂😂
Does your van have a crack in the wind shield ?
Utah😮stop and visit Trent & Allie
If i was yall i would be going to warm places in the winter haha
Beautiful dog
Wooo back to the van videos!!
Back to Van Life and our great country USA! 🇺🇸 I’ve been waiting for this 🙏🏻❤️
The guy beside Kara during the Adele concert is my favourite bit.
Altitude sickness is no joke! Coming from New York, I was always out of breath & getting headaches, while I tried to adjust to the altitude change in Colorado. But, loved it there, Beautiful state!!
So glad to see y’all back in the van!!!! I’m so excited for this trip!!!😊
Wow.   She can really sing.               Oh…..and Adele is pretty good too.
Omg I can’t believe ur going back to van life
Can't wait to see these videos. I'm following on Instagram but the videos are my fav.! Thanks for taking us along on this epic trip!
I’m seeing Adele’s last show in Las Vegas in a few weeks flying from the UK ❤️❤️❤️
I was LIVING when Kara was posting all the Adele clips on insta. She is a dream! I’m so happy y’all were able to make it. ❤
You need to combine worlds by taking the van to Europe!
I recognize that lowes
I can't wait for your video with your grandfather, Nate! As well as the bike across America! Absolutely adore your channel.
Don't just tell me. Show me. I'm from Missouri.
awesome
The smile on Kara's face to see Adele was so precious. It reminded me of how I felt when I finally got to see the backstreet boys after over 20 years of wanting to see them live
Well I started this morning with Eamon and Bec, now watching your epic journey begin (yet another van life adventure!!), and oh, baby, I'm already crying thinking of the special one-of-a-kind video that you guys are about to release, with Grandpa and his restored van. Keep it coming Kara and Nate... can't get enough of you guys
Ahhhh! I live in Arnold Missouri and seen you van parked there! I thought "wow that looks a lot like their van" looks like it was! Lol
Van arc 2!!!
Yay 🎉🎉
CANNOT WAIT!
Nice to see you again in de van😃😎👍🏻🌞🌺🍀Wow Kara we are so happy for you 😃🎊🎉 Adele 🥰😎👍🏻🌞🌺🍀
I’m sure Adele would love you guys.
Woohoo!! 🎉🎉🎉 Love seeing you guys back in the van! We installed that same water filter and have loved it the past year. Hope to run into you someday! 😊🚐
I’ve been a fan for years now. I was wondering how yall pass the time while driving. And wondering if you have thought of starting a podcast of you driving. Or even a patreon?  Love you guys. Thanks for all your hard work.
When will you be in Terre Haute, Indiana?
Glenwood canyon is the most expensive interstate ever built in the united states
That’s literally where I parked my van when I stayed at the Linq! I got a discount for parking cuz I guess the hotel owns it
I LIVE IN STL
So happy that Kara gets to slow down for a couple months in her home country with friends and family like she needed so badly :) You can tell she looks so much happier and refreshed already. And its important to force Nate to slow down a bit too! haha
I was just on those Tennessee/Kentucky roads last Monday thru Wednesday.
Love it
Tag yourself, i'm the guy sitting next to Kara who was clearly dragged to the Adele concert against his will 😂
you guys don’t know how happy I am that you’re back to Van life. This is how I discovered you guys when I was thinking about starting car life (I’ve now been living in my car for almost 2 years and have traveled the country 3 times seeing 24/50 states) and you guys have been super cool motivation :)
You could use Bifacial solar panels that allow light to pass through them.  This would allow you to continue using your other panels at least to some extent.   You could also use the holes that are already there to install a sliding rack that would allow the panels to slid out from under the deck when parked.  Last option would be to install a wire deck that allows light though and still can be used for sitting on or cargo.
You guys should do the Appalachian trail
The dude next to Kara at the concert looked like his wife/GF dragged him there.
RAAM race?
Not me crying at Kara’s Adele reaction. 🫂💗
Awww.  I cant wait for the video with your Grandpa.  Just from the preview I can tell it's going to be amazing.
welcome back home you two!
Um excuse you.... obviously never been to the Adventure Dome
Yay! Happy you're back in the van!
Gosh so crazy to see you both soo far away, given a few weeks back you where in Wales just 10 mins away from me in Chirk and Ellesmere, all the best to you both on your new adventure xxxx
Bangladesh best van toyota noah 2018
I love Sundays! Love from Ohio.
Goodluck guys 🎉🎉🎉
AHHHH I MISSED THIS
Congratulations
I always thought Utah is the Beehive State.  I wonder when they changed their slogan?
I was at the adele concert!!! and i didn’t see you guys 🥲
I LOVED seeing how happy Kara got for Adele😭😭❤️🤧
Aw, I would have love to meet you guys in St. Louis!
OMG YES, VAN LIFE
Omg who’s baby is that ❤ so adorable!
Yaaaaaay I love vanlife content!🎉
"LIVE FREE OR DIE" is New Hampshires motto 😅 My most memorable license plate read.
you already told us what it is so i dont understamd the mystery  but im not spoiling the surprise  but good things come in three
Hey guys, is there a way i could email you guys? Bobby
Yall going to Venice beach
I love u guys so much, plz don't ever stop dng what u do! Much love from Florida ❤
kara is clearly tired of living the vanlife but he is what she chose soooo
The pure excitement that Kara had during the Adele concert melts my heart I cant express this enough how you both deserved that moment 😊 I hope you had the best time Kara and hope you have a great future with your travels x Absolutely love the vids I can sit through your videos guys but not a film 😂
Awwwww Pop made me cry 😭😭😭
23:56 Did she just say “Bowl apetit”?
This video was epic.  Kara was so fun to watch.   I can’t believe you guys can top what you’ve already done!!!!  Thank you thank you thank you. Love to you both from LIZ in California.🤟🏻💜😎🐬🚵‍♂️🚴‍♂️🚲🚲
Just an FYI, but DC is 3 hours from the Atlantic Ocean. You can dip the tire in the Potomac River.
You both just make me feel so comfortable and happy
yall are crazy
would be cool to see you vanlife where you drive acros europ
Wow! This will be fun!!
I don't think I've ever commented on YouTube before. But I just had to say that I love your videos. They have been brightening my week for the past 4 years, and they are the source of a lot of my dreams. You are the only channel I never got bored of; I love watching all of your incredible experiences, along with how hilarious, enthusiastic or just human you can sometimes be. I'm about to watch this video and I'm sure it won't disappoint.  Thank you!!!❤
Two years????  How in the world??  It seemed like a few months ago!
Who needs Netflix when we have these 2 beautiful people entertaining us?
It has been a while since I saw a van life video and im so excited :)
I already knew bc I follow the on Instagram 😊
So excited Dusty & Sarah ate on this trip!! I already know This is going to be epic! 👏👏👏❤❤❤
Yeah, glad to see you back to vanlife ❤❤❤❤☕️☕️☕️☕️☕️👏🏽👏🏽💪🏾💪🏾👍👍
I knew it! I knew as soon as you mentioned who was joining that it was going to not only be a bike trip, but that you would probably be biking across the US! Looking forward to the other videos that are going to follow this one. Also I love that you started this adventure off in the city I was born and grew up in.
If you guys want another unique challenge you should do the seventy48 next May! It's a 70 mile race from Tacoma to Port Townsend, on the water, human powered vessels only. You have 48 hours to finish, and you start at 7:00 pm. People will be rowing, kayaking, paddling, etc. If I can keep on with training I'll be rowing it :)
I think that dirt was a wasps nest. Also I hope you checked your air filter because animals like making nests in those.
So glad you're back in the van.  Certainly some epic adventures in it for sure!!  So fun to watch Kara at Adele's concert!  That girl is star struck big time!  Can't wait for this bike ride coming up!!
This is how I found you guys during the Pandemonium—feels like coming home 😂
yayy im so happy i love your van life videos 😊
You can tell the guy sitting next to Kara at the concert looked annoyed. First off, he looked like he got roped into going to the concert, then he was sitting next to an overzealous groupie, poor guy.
Ahhhh!!! So much to say about this video!! Firstly, as a Coloradan, Glenwood Canyon is absolutely gorgeous, highly recommend!! Secondly, Kara, you are worth it! I mean, it’s Adele, how can you not!!! What a dream to see her. I love her spicy and spunky personality, so funny and unmatched talent!! Ever since you posted the videos to IG of the concert I’ve been listening to her again non stop!! Lastly, I am so excited to watch this adventure unfold with these amazing humans! Y’all are just the best! Safe biking🧡 Stay you ✌🏼
Kara and Nate van life is probably my all-time favorite van life. I can smell/anticipate the peanut-butter ramen now and I’m only four minutes in 🥳🤪🥰
Can we get a van tour of the order vans?
Great vlog but I swear Kara is Dick Van Dykes granddaughter… her English accent is straight out of bed knobs and broomsticks! 😂😂😂😂
“Absence makes the heart grow fonder” 😊
you could build a frame with sliding rails for the new solar panels. when you park you slide them out over the door then maybe you can use both sets of solar panels. if it now works with different panels. namely saw one who did so. The Finnish couple Vantastic did so two years ago
Hope u got to Texas and show use Texas
I have fallen in love with kara all over again sorry Nate but she is the best 😘😘😘.
Dusty & Sarah got their own van!
Doing this in October going the wrong direction... God help yall.
Kara you missed out on a good breakfast at Kracker Barrel. Btw Show Is Sooo much better than Colorado ' Pike p or bust.
also nate enough crap on the show me state🤣
What happened to Kara's Chapstick addiction
you should say what route so we can wave as u go by
As a native Coloradoan, it makes me so happy to see you love my state so much!
The Van (TM)
You can park big vans on roof top parking in Las Vegas. Example the top of the bellagio. You don’t have to drive through the garage to get there you just drive up a ramp and enter whatever level so drive to the top and park there. (Grew up in Vegas and that where we would park our 15 seater van) Just in case you end up there again. Also I live in KS now so that was funny and I LOVE Adele so cool that you got to see her.
“Kardele”, you are so cute! I’m so glad you’re back in the van…but seriously…Nate, stop hating on Missouri. We get enough of that. MO has plenty of green hills and rivers. Guess who is flat and brown and dry? (Show me.) The eastern half of CO. 🧐🤭
your going to ride boke from cal to east coast. pacific coast to Atlantic coast irbwest coast to east coast lol
I’m thinking you probably should have started on the east coast. 🥶
So, two things: 1) I went to Adele’s concert when she came to New Zealand a number of years ago… best concert of my life. Probably best night of my life. Every moment was incredible! So Kara, I feel your joy! 2)in regards to your bike ride… my dad rode my bicycle from Seattle to Boston… must have been 12 years ago I think. He went with an organised group, so lots of individual cyclists, but there also some multi person bikes. One of the best experiences of Luis life.. he must have been about…. 63 then I think?
Omg I'm travelling from Aus to Vegas this weekend! I hope you guys are having an amazing journey! I've been following on instagram, thanks for inspiring us, as always!! ❤
I don't like pancakes either
rio hotel n casino has convention center n huge parking area it's in the back n we parked travel trailer there while playing at pool tournament.  we stayed in travel trailer 4 days no one said a word n sec waved everytime they came by .lol
Omw I live ao close to oceanside I hope that maybe I'll get to see them!!!!
just to think you passed by my cracker barrel and i could’ve been there makes me sick i wish i could meet you guys! safe travel!
Kara's happiness is just so beautiful 🥹 and nates happiness for hers' is equally as beautiful 😭
You are going to love her show 😁 nothing like seeing her live, and her humour is bloody awesome 🤩😍
Fort Hays State University in Hays, Ks and it is where I live!!!
Oasis rv park in vegas is very nice
Oh wow back in the day a LONG time ago, I stayed at Circus Circus. lol It wasn't bad. Buffet was decent Seeing Kara so happy was everything. Well played, Nate! I love that you both make sure each of you get to do the things you most want to do. Ya'll are doin' life right in the best way. Except...then ya make her bike across the country. lol Luxury to roughin' it is your motto. haha
I’m so sad you were here in Las Vegas and I didn’t get to see you! Kara’s Adele excitement would be mine for meeting you two. Lol Glad you got to see her. Concerts are so pricey here. Living here is more of a hindrance for concerts because it’s often cheaper to buy a plane ticket, rent-a-car and get a hotel room overnight in addition to show tickets for the price of one ticket here. 😂
I was just abt to say it was probably the best money you spent on Kara since she was so emotional and happy and loving every moment of it🥹🥹
A good friend of mine, who lives in France, and was raised in Pennsylvania, flew in to New York and rode his bike from New York City to San Francisco in less than three weeks! He’s 55 years old. He had 130 pounds of things on his bike for camping, eating , and dressing. He used an app put together from serious bikers that tells you the best route for biking.  On the app they also have people who will host you or help you if there any issues come up. He had no issues and absolutely loved it. Have a wonderful, safe trip and enjoy our beautiful USA!
circus circus has or had campground
i love the cuts between Kara chillin in the van and Nate suffering on that mountain xD such a vibe. You deserve it Kara!
Am I the only one whose heart dropped when Nate sighed and said “I have really bad news….”?
Congratulations on a new Van life adventure! One that doesn't include any gas explosions or almost electrocutions, thus far. Love the spontaneity of this video. I was crying tears of joy with Kara during the concert part. Looks like it was absolutely amazing. Love you guys, take care and God bless always.
I loved this episode
I have to have back surgery on the 23rd so im looking forward to getting to see how the next journey goes while im down. Kinda surprised you decided to do that trip this late in the year however. should get some beautiful views of trees changing color as you go however so that will be a plus.
You should only go to Home Depot not Lowes
The best of luck on your bike trip! Stay safe! ❤️
Kara, what LLBean jacket are you wearing in the van?  Love it!
16:45
ahahaha i am not proud to say that i actually started coughing and gagged at what was clogging your grey tank 😅😂
I'm more excited for Pop content than the bike trip! I'm sorry granparents touch my heart HAHAHAHA!
Done that😊been there! It’s very flat in Kansas!!!
I absolutely your biking videos across vast distances, they're a ton of fun! I cannot wait to see those videos and I am also super excited to see what the big ole luxury trip that follows will be! I cannot even begin to think where the next adventure is gonna be :D I am stoked lol
this was a good episode, i enjoyed it from begining to end
honestly i think they will be doing a long mountain bike ride like the colorado trail but its from leadville to Ocean Side
I lived close to Carlsbad and yall should try Joe's Crab Shak. It is SO SO GOOD!!! And really close to Carlsbad!
What A WILD ride.  Thank You for ALL your travels.  Stay healthy and Safe.
Don’t come at Missouri like that! 😭😭 go to the ozarks in MO! It’s absolutely beautiful!
I dare your wife to go a week with out coffee
Do you guys ever just stay in USA and just take it easy for a few weeks ?
Would you ever consider a van remodel now that you're using it again? Maybe to replace the shower with more practical storage or a small seating area, or to add a bed loft that you don't have to set up/tear down with storage underneath?
you stayed at the circus circus rv park??? 😂😂 you brave souls
I got a add for a Colorado trip right at they went through the Colorado border 😂 😂😂
How could you miss Stateline?!  The 2 giant hotels and then nothing?! LOL
So hope Adele see this ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Looking forward to another bike journey, awesome announcement
ITS OOOOOOOTAH!!!!!!!
been a subscriber for forever now, love when y’all go back to more relatable content! :) love y’all’s stuff!
Is it even a K and N video if Kara doesn’t proclaim it the best day ever? Also you guys know Washington D.C. isn’t on the Atlantic Ocean, right?
Are yall at Paradise by the Sea RV resort in Oceanside? My family has spent summers there for years!!!
Kara opting out of the hike to embrace the comfy solitude of the van is such a mood. Our girl 😂
I would of had the same excitement Kara…. I Love Adele and secretly pray Someone gifts me tickets for my 65 birthday November 6th🙏🏻🎼
What a COOL idea!! I can’t wait to watch this adventure unfold!  I am so pumped you’re ending in the DC area! But unfortunately you won’t quite reach the Atlantic Ocean here! You’ll need to keep going east past DC and the Chesapeake Bay to actually reach the coast. I can’t wait to see where you end up! Bon Voyage! 🚲
That dirt is a Dirt Dauber nest. 😂
I love you Kara! Please wear your seat belt properly! ❤
I knew it!!
van life was always my favorite content
adventures with Dusty and Sarah are my favorite!
I don’t think anyone can understand the excitement that I get when Kara and Nate post a new video!!!
Wow you guys are crasy good luck on your adventure i love your vids thanks for making me smile evry week
Yess i missed the van life vids 🤘🏻🤘🏻
Love seeing Kara so happy!  She almost made me cry!  Can't wait to see Pop's adventure in his VW van!  He's the original vanlifer!  He started it all!
Thank you for saying Nevada correctly I’m impressed. A lot of outsiders say Nevoda and we don’t like it 🤣
Circus circus parking lot if still there for rv/vans fyi. Well back in 2004
Wouldn’t it be cool if @Adele saw this!!!
Van life? I'm back! I am eagerly waiting for the big adventure. Fantastic!
Did u change the thumbnail?
Hey guys come on out to the Maple Lead Festival in Missouri. One heck of a festival and marching band competition!!
Ooh, does this mean you'll finally be coming to my state (CT) at some point? 😄
I live in Utah and you guys saying that you stayed at one of the best camping spots in Utah made my whole day!😁 Thank you for always making my day better❤️ Safe travels.❤
Nate: "Kara's day is a little more expensive if we're being honest"!  Kara: "I'm so worth it"! 😁  No argument from Nate, or any of us Kara! 😇 😉😘 Also, Nates Grandfathers van is beautiful! Love the colors, great job on the restoration!
I bloody LOVE Adele.  If you do become best friends, can you tell her to pop back to the UK for a few shows. Please. Thank you. 🤣
YAAAYYYY!!! Van life and the Vagbrai team are back. Exciting!!!
Showerhead is one word... unless you meant something totally different, which you couldn't show on this channel anyway!
Seeing Kara cry at the Adele concert hit me so hard because I would be crying too!! Adele is such a legend and I'd love to see her in concert some day!! Hope it made your dreams come true Kara!! Nate you're such a good husband. Recognizing you had your day and giving Kara her dream day, you're the best! Both of you are!! ❤ Love watching your videos each week!
It is so good that you guys are back on Van Life. That was the best on the channel and its amazing that you are back to it. Not sure about the 30 days bike ride. Thats a huge goal. But then make it 40 days or however long it takes you. You will see tons of stuff and its gonna be fun. Well hopefully for you with all the maniacs on the road.
Kara crying at Adele just made my afternoon. The love of an artist so great that brings you to tears, is a powerful thing. Her voice is beautiful. My Sister and her Wife got to see her this summer as well and the video was fantastic.
Yay for Van Life! We have missed it for sure!
I live in Colorado! Enjoy :)
I've stayed at circus circus its actually a nice place very family friendly.
Does Sarah and Dusty have a channel?❤
I’ve been looking forward to this video for two weeks since I follow you on Instagram!! It’s fun timing because I’ve been rewatching your van life videos from 2020/2021.  One thing is kinda bugging me, from this video and from a clip on Instagram - you can’t dip the bike in the Atlantic Ocean from Washington DC. The Potomac River, yes. Go a little farther east and you can dip it in the Chesapeake Bay. But not the ocean.
Quit bagging on the "Show Me" state bro.........................Missouri is a beautiful state!!!!!!
I absolutely love all of your van videos and Adele so happy your back in the van can’t wait to watch your new adventures and memories ❤!!
You two are so inspiring! ❤❤❤
You need to raise the solar panels enough to slide your surfboards under them.
Awww, I’m so excited for the video with your Pop before your cross country trip! 👏🏼 My maternal grandparents are in Heaven and paternal grandparents aren’t as mobile at all. Precious memories with your Pop! ❤️🥳 Just like the videos with your parents, Kara’s sister, and more!  Kara and Nate, y’all are my favorite out of all the “YouTube travelers”!  Your friends are cool too! But I’m biased, you guys were the first channel I’ve stumbled upon and you do super fun, exciting challenges with your family that most wouldn’t!
yall give me hope that someday I will find somebody to do this with. <3
Thank you guys you keep me interested During the war that is happening in my country
I thought I saw you guys when you came to St Louis
My dream came true!
Nate is being Nate again. “This is the best money I’ve spent on Kara” like he would be who he is without Kara 😒
rowing challenge?????
should have stopped in KC ! knowing y'all drove right past my apartment through here makes me kind of sad lol
The concert was so good that my mom flew from south Africa just to see Adele and I missed out on seeing my idols😢😅😅
Y’all got me doing, what I call the “state thing” each time we cross over to another state. Now I have my 9 year old granddaughter doing it 😂😂😂.
Adele is ok
I have got to know who’s idear was this???
I literally said to myself I wish Kara and Nate would go back to van life yesterday!
Everyone dreads the Kansas part, I also kind of don’t like following you guys on instagram since I know what you were trying to hide the whole video. Good luck
I just had to say that my late husband made and brought me my coffee whenever he could. i know what that means to both of you. omg, i miss him so much! ❤
I cannot wait for your trip with your grandpa!!
Yea for Van Life!! I love your van life adventures and the fun spontaneous adventures you experience along the way.
I first discovered your channel during the van life phase, and so I'm thrilled to follow the new van life adventure.
Wait Kara this is so sad! I’ve loved you and this channel for years but you just said you don’t like pancakes and now I don’t know if I can trust you anymore 😭😭😭
Biking across America!! Wow!!
A few years ago I drove I-70 through Glenwood Canyon and was a little alarmed/disappointed at/by how fast I traveled through.  In a radical departure from my usual travel philosophy I took an extra day to double back and pass through the canyon three times and added a little hiking for a few miles.  With an evening stop at Glenwood Springs to soak!  It was very awesome!
We decided to go see Pink in concert AS the concert was playing.  Online tickets were suspended so we drove down to chance it, we figured we'd go out and have a nice dinner if we missed it.  We got there after the supporting acts during the intermission but had an amazing time and lucked out with fantastic seats.  We've never done this before so this was crazy for us.  I think that is about as last minute as you can get!  There is fun booking things ahead of time, getting the seats you want and anticipating it, but there is crazy fun doing things last minute as well so long as you are ok with missing out too.
Hey I am from Israel and we need all your support we are having a crazy and sad situation bi us the terror organization Hamas murdered and kidnapped men woman kids it's sad please support Israel
I loved Nate's excitement for Kara's excitement! It was so genuine!!! :) looking forward to the Buchannan camping trip!
Circus Circus used to be the in spot back in the day.
That's nuts. Awesome, but nuts.
Hi
If you are near yuma, AZ and need a RV hook up spot, I have one.
Please please please say you'll do a little meet up in DC! <3 (Love from DC)
so why I can't hang here...does everything have to be big toothy smiles and over the top excitement?  Life can be good yeah..but just watching everything having to be soooo fabulous and wonderful and high energy and smiley all the time is exhausting...
I think you guys already told us where , what and with who already in anotehr vid ... In fact been waiting for you new adventure to start sounds fun
If y'all are ever going thru Texas your always welcome in Goldthwaite
I love it when you spend time in Colorado! The drive through Glenwood Canyon is my favorite, too. Woohoo, van life is back!
I created a suggested motto for Missouri's tourism board: "Missouri loves company." What do you think?
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
we have big horn sheep
Good luck guys!❤ Stay safe! I can't wait to watch the adventure!
If you guys want to come see the redwoods in Northern California I could show you some of the most amazing places ❤ it's my home and Is stunning, I would love to meet you both soo so much too 😅❤
So excited to see van life return and you're coming to my area! Just a quick FYI, the atlantic is about 90 miles from DC, but you can  certainly dip your tire in tributaries - Potomac River or Chesapeake Bay.
I could be wrong about this but at 4:45 the unit you're holding is called a Tee-nut and you need to insert the opposite end into the rail. This allows a  fastener (e.g.- bolt or stud) to be located (slideable) where needed to mount something such as a solor panel.
Congratulations on your new bike adventure, but I was kinda hoping you were getting a dog. But I guess that wouldn't work out with your current lifestyle.  Have fun, be safe!
Not sure where you guys found the state slogan for Utah, but it is Life Elevated!!! lol
Literally live 5 minutes from Palisade and work right off i70 and Sauvage Spectrum, while I do not drink wine, is literally the best vineyard and the one I recommend to anyone who wants to go wine tasting in Palisade
After 800 plus videos posted to YouTube, I was just looking for something critical to say about at least one of your videos.  Nope. I got nothing. Unless you go back to using that atrocious soundtrack music in the beginning, I’m going to watch this one at random, many times too.  Darn you!  🥰
Kara would marry Adele if she could 😂🤣😂
You guys are the best!! I just bought a van, but it has seemed like all of my favorite van lifers are settling down. Seeing Kara’s excitement for getting to do van life again, it is making me excited to start adventuring!!
the guys with the 2 or 3 Lil girls that you bike rode with
We were just there last week!
So I know its a very tiny chance of being right....i just can't help but share! Last night I dreamed that y'all we're announcing kara was pregnant. 😊
Pacific NW? That’s my guess!
are you going to the dog rescue?
Love the van videos, will you ever be buying a newer one though? And build it yourself?  It would be an amazing series to watch, although a bit pricey.
what people do for viewers is Crazy
longer hose or add pipe or just shower in the shower lol
You guys stayed minutes from my house in St. Louis! Can’t believe you guys were so close!
I do not understand why Adele did not have Kara sing on stage with her.   You two are just as famous as she is, so I bet Adele would be star struck in your presence.  Ok, perhaps I exaggerate a bit, but I am touched by the giddiness Kara had the who day, and I noticed Nate was into it as well.  Fantastic seats.  Perfect evening.  As for your next adventure riding across America I can say it is very ambitious, but I know all of you will achieve this goal.  Hats off to you.
Going o. Another bike. Ride is my guess
❤❤❤
I live 1.5 2.0 hrs from Las Vegas in laughlin come visit u can fill up water ect n yse 1 of my showers n do laundry
They where flying down that highway!!
YAY!! I can’t believe van life is back!! These were my favorite videos!!! ❤❤❤
Can you go to Maine in the appalations
Omg I missed your van life episodes. And so excited to watch the huge bike adventure ❤❤❤ a
Love you guys! However that thing you do when passing from state to state got really annoying !
Love this random video of goodness! Roadtrip, van life fun, Dusty and Sarah joining in their awesome looking van AND Adele and Vegas! Made me smile and laugh this Sunday morning - thank you. Can't wait to see the video next week with Nate and his grandpa - I was wondering if it would happen (and we would see it). 🥰 Looking forward to your epic adventure in a couple of weeks!
Oh Kara you made me cry watching you be so very happy and wrapped up in the music and Adele ❤
Back to the old van
WHEN YOU GET TO THE EAST COAST, TRY THE EAST COAST GREENWAY FROM MAINE TO THE KEYS OF FLORIDA????
Missouri tigers is Missouri college  🏈
I think you ruined the night if the guy beside you . People are there to hear the artist sing not you
i have to say i  have been watching for 3 years now, and i'm going to admit this finally, i think you two are the craziest people on youtube, lol
I’d limit my state chants to three repeats . Less annoying
So much fun to watch Kara at the Adele concert. Nothing like seeing your favorite artist live.
Sorry...   Has to fast forward through the Adele .....    was over done to me
please shave the mustache 🙏🙏
Loved this Vlog in  the van guys Nate videoing himself rather than the state sign was something I would do but watching Kara’s excitement grow  for Adele and  Nate being made up to see her so happy got me in my feels 🥹🥹🥹.
Bike Trip with Rick and the Family and Sarah and Dusty.
The guy next to ypu is funny
The Merch  you were talking about at the Walmart was Fort Hays State University merchandise which is a local College in hays  Kansas
does this mean the 50 states goal will finally happen!!! 😁
I love you guys, but you forgot to add shave off that stach Nate. Please😢
Kara, weirdly specific question, but what did you season the tofu with?  I swear that's not all I got from this video, but I'm always looking for new ways to season tofu, LOL.
Am I the only one this excited for a physical adventure. 🤔..super excited 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Nate is never late with with Kara’s coffee ☕️ it’s the little things guys.
I love you guys so much and when you lable the sections of the videos like the one with the blank is so funny because it bring is the aspect of not knowing the name of a video or show or song and typing in what is the episode with the blah blah blah is so funny and I love it 😂❤
Looking forward to the van episode coming up with Nate’s grandpa (and of course also the bike trip across America)! 😊
YAYYYYY VAN LIFE
😊 I've driven through Glenwood canyon with my parents many times
love van life!
I am at 7:34, i'm betting that drawer never gets fixed. LOL love the vids. Ah, I am thrilled to be wrong!
Hey Kara let’s meet for coffee!
so..... like sometimes you travel around the world being in different places, countryes hotels and airbnb you know. But like between videos, or yeah sometimes the behind the scenes are connected, where to you live when you have a home at all..... just tring to put the behind the camera life together. love you guys!
This episode is amazing so glad you guys are doing van life again I love those episodes just be safe on your trip and have another amazing adventure ❤
Eeewww Nate, please wear gloves when dealing with grey tanks etc!
Wow look at Kara cleaning out that toilet, no problem, I remember the first time she had to empty the pee compartment! She's come a long way, go girl!!
If I missed you guys through Colorado again I'm gonna cry 😭 I wanna spot a Kara and Nate in the wild
Awesome Safe Journeys 😎💪🍻
I finally finished the video! Nate, y’all going camping with your Gramps in his van brings back so many memories of time I spent with my Gramps (and Grandma) in an old school Winnebago camping when I was a kid. My Grandparents are my favorite people on the planet! Thanks for the nostalgia and I’m really looking forward to next weeks video!!!
Excited for you guys to be back in the van Adele is amazing
I hope your special day will bring you lots of happiness, love and fun😍💞
So happy you got to see Adele Kara! It was the best show i’ve ever seen both times.😉🥰🥳🤩🎉
Yay super excited! And omg look how big Evie got😍
How many states do y’all still have left on your list to visit? I’m thinking around 20ish 🤷🏽😁
Circus Circus has an amazing steak restaurant
Love van-life series . From the Show Me State 🍁 home of the KC Chiefs ❤
You were in Hays Kansas, its really close to my home town!
Kara and Nate back to Vanlife . Love it going to be an amazing adventure 😊
Petition to get Dusty and Sarah on social media
26:47  This reminds me of when I dragged my husband to a Cher concert and he realized he knew more Cher songs than he thought.  He actually tells people that he was impressed and in awe of her career.
Yes, I can smell the gray water through the camera. Lol.
Nice.... Biking across the US..... Also, that should probably add a bunch more Subscribers.....
The gays want Nate to have an OF! Lol jk jk
This is without a doubt the most terrifying daunting thing I have ever seen you do, well any body do, your bravery knows no limits, your endurance has no end, your ability to survive the most body and spirit breaking things and places is second to none, it is hard to contemplate but you did it, you went to Newsom'e California and survived. Amazing.
Yeees van life is back 🎉
What an amazing video!!! Back to van life yeah! missed it! Watching Kara at Adele's concert was the best part of the video, week, month, maybe year!!! So touching!!!😍😍😍
Your videos mean so much to me it's like a Christmas present every time I see a new one. So happy that you guys want to come back to Colorado we miss you
The man next to you at the concert didn't seem to be enjoying the concert as much as you were!
When you were talking about your Pop, I sobbed. I miss my Pop so much. I can not wait for that video.
I am so pumped for this!!! Love this channel and you both so much 🖤
Guess I'm missing your adventure, not going on Instagram.  Have fun!
Great vid until. "it's Kara's days " again and again and again....over and over
Can we talk about Nate's checkered socks though 👌😂
Im so excited!!!!!!
Crazy ppl lol
one of my favorite videos in a long time!!! so cute, fun, and entertaining!!! <3
👏👏👏 FROM SOUTH AFRICA
After 14er, He is still driving, while she is just slipping away! If I unsubscribe, it will be because of her attitude...!
✨💚🌎💚✨ Wat the Wat!! Why WHY Why!! My butt hurts thinking of it!!!👻😇👻
You should visit Florence CO. to get a tour of Trump's future home; FDX Florence.
Here I was thinking you were going to some trail on a pogo stick, blindfolded. But still awesome challenge! Also Kara, I also made fun of your “ the best… ever” but I do hope you keep doing it! As it shows how much fun you are having!😊 anywho thanks for the episode. 😊
26:16 "THE LOOK" when your wife had the time of her life and you reaped the reward! DO I NEED TO SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU?
Well I don’t instragram and am sorry I didn’t get to cheer you on when you left Oceanside and pass my town!  Can’t wait to see how your trip goes!
The can always makes a comeback! 🩷
2023 kara and nate van life is everything i've ever wanted
Yay!!! I have missed your van life videos!! I was hoping van life was not totally dead. Welcome back to your lil home on wheels and I can't wait to see where roads take you two! Safe travels!
You guys are the best. Other videos I fast forward but I love your videos too much to do that. I’m so happy you got to see Adele. I love her too.
When I saw the title of this video I screamed yes I love them van life vids
Hello from Kansas! I live 23 miles south of Hays! La Crosse Ks, Barbwire Capital of the World! They don't make barbed wire here, but we do have a museum with over 900 different kinds of barbed wire! Plus, we have the Post Rock Museum! I'm sure you seen some of the stone post as you drove through the Hays area!
LETS GO I LOVE THE VAN LIFE VIDEOS
im so happy kara had a good night with adele ❤
LETS GO ANOTHER BIKE VIDEO!
OMG i miss Van life and im so happy Kara got to see Adele ❤❤
Hope everyone stays safe!
Hello 👋 ❤❤
The adventure gang is back together and I couldn't be happier
I love all the travel videos you’ve made, but van life has a special place in my heart! I always go back to the colorado trail and ragbrai series!! I’m so happyyy to see the whole crew together!!
The van is not big enough for Nate's 'stache.
I seen the spoiler already but im excited to see Yall through this
I love your videos. Just a quick tip. When changing headlight bulbs you should wear latex gloves because the oils on your fingers can cause the bulbs to burn out again soon.
I like that Nate comes with a plan and makes a fun list to follow along with.  I have a distaste for the fact that Kara finds it cute to add unnecessary items to HIS list.  Can he be fun without you, for once? go get coffee or something man..
✨💚🌎💚✨ BUT NATE? BEST MONEY IVE EVER SPENT ON KARA!🤔😲🤪 HELLO!!! REALLY? REALLY!!!💕 🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃🎃
Fort Hays State University Tigers!
That license plate blurr came a whole second late 😅😅 13:24
Omg How annoying is your song between states
No way!!!!
It is such a joy to follow your adventures as if you were a favorite Niece and Nephew. Thank you!
Nate I do agree that distance does make the heart grow fonder  But how do u know about that lol U go away with ur wife not away from her Hehe We love sitting down and watching you guys  Have done for 3 years now  Oh what fun we have witnessed ❤❤ keep doing it
Yey! Vanlife is back!
Dusty and Sara have a van now?? They need a channel. They are part of the family and we need to see content 😂
✨💚🌎💚✨ OMGODDESS IVE NEVER SEEN SO MUCH JOY RADIATING OUT OF KARA LIKE HER SEEING ADEL🧚🏼‍♀️
Wow its like the third "back to vane life"
Nate. Please for Kara's safety, Please nag her about putting her feet on the dash while driving. Google some pictures of what happens when you get in a wreck while doing this and you will see why .
lol, it costs more than $23 to park at one's own office area in ATL for the work day, so yah, you got lucky.  or vegas just really likes tourists.  guessing the latter
why don't u get a huge ass bus and drive around the world with it? I would if i could :D
Can’t wait to see you and your grandpa’s trip ♥️
I was almost jealous of Kara, but then I remember nate making her bungy jump, and the envy goes away. 😄
Yay! Van life!! Been waiting for this return!
Are you enjoying nevada? For your next stop you should go hiking in the Ruby Mountains. (34 mile Hike to Ruby Dome)
So great to see yall back on the road!
I can’t believe you went through hays I live a hour away and I have always wanted to see you I wish I would have known
Did Nate drop an F bomb? Talking about the good wine? 💣🤣 21:41
This episode was loud. 🥴
U guys need to meet up with Nikki delvanthal she lived in her Prius for three years and now she’s in a van with her dog camper u guys would get on like an house on fire
OMG 33:54 I grew up in Ocean side
When i see Kara’s excitement I’m so happy for her also I’m happy you guys back to van life!
lol It makes me sad to hear you say that circus circus looks run down. I stayed there as a child 20 years ago (when i was like 12) and i loved it xD. But then as i was writing this i realized that was 20 years ago. Love y'alls adventures can't wait to see what is next.
Pacific Coast Trail? California. what else could it be? hummmmm. my guess.
😊❤️🇨🇦
What a joy to see Kara watching Adele and Nate watching Kara.
So much amazing content in one video ❤
If the good Lord wanted me on top of a mountain, he would have given me wings!
We need a van tour of D&S van, and I would not mind another tours of K&N and R&B vans
do you guys ever take a break from traveling????  love your videos. take care you two...
I follow u for years but van life episodes are best probably because u r not van lifers. More van life please.
Watching Kara at the concert was the best part for sure! Pure joy on her face! You deserve it Queen! And Nate just sitting there in the van letting you have your own concert on the way, SWEET AF ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Uhhh why didn’t you pick the todo list up again
6:50 we finally get a mention of Dusty and Sarah (and a hint that maybe they have a van too???)! 8:16 the first of the Kara Superlatives! Wait, are we not going to get any kind of intro to Dusty & Sarah's van??!! There must be some kind of story here!
Hello gorges humans
I went to see adele as well and your reaction is the same as mine! blown AWAY
I don't care what anyone says, I love when Kara is excited for something she makes it the most! It's so sweet!
I love you guys so much!!!! It’s like when I was a kid a very very long time ago - before VCRs - before streaming- when all you had was live TV and I couldn’t wait for my favorite TV show to come on.  That’s me again at 61 waiting for the next Kara and Nate video to come out!!! Love your hearts for people and adventure.  ❤❤❤
pls go to lawrenceburg tn
I have said it before, and I will say it again Kara's infectious joy and Nates perfect diction make this channel so special.
the woman is SO annoying
I enjoy watching you guys! I’m from Oceanside ca
You two are my favorite YouTube channel.  One because I love to travel too, second because you’re from Nashville, Tennessee which is where I was born and lived up until 1986 when we moved to Evanston, Illinois.  Nashville is where my 4 besties live, my sister, nephews and nieces live, my cousins and the rest of my family live.  I like that you both are from Nashville, and you’re family too.  You know how it is in the south, everybody is family.
Waiting on collab with Kara and Adele.😮❤
So nice to c u back on van life ❤
I think this video broke my record of repeatedly checking to see if I liked the video already…. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ here’s all the extra love I wish I could give through that like button. I love you guys as much as Kara loves Adele 😂
THAN’ YOU U HAVE JUST MADE MY DAY U DO NOT UNDERSTAND MY DAY WAS ALFALL
The way Kara looked at Nate at 35:59.. she had so much love in her eyes ♥️
I just went to my first concert ever and got to see my favorite band in the world play. I got notice by two of the three members and that was definitely a dream come true.I am so glad I got to achieve that dream so when you were excited I felt that 😁
Do not even have to think who you are meeting, love it when you hang out with that family and Dusty and Sarah too.
i get made fun of for loving adele, but seeing Kara share the same love for her makes me so happy
Was feeling super burnt out but after seeing your video I feel way better
I'm excited for y'all, but I don't understand why you're avoiding the rest of the states in the Midwest. I know it's not the most exciting place in the world, but your avoidance makes it feel like we're trash :(
In 1997 I was 8 and my family took a month long cross country vacation in an RV. We stopped in Vegas and parked in that same exact lot. I remember going to circus circus and having the best time playing a few games and winning a stuffed animal 😅.
I don’t like Adele’s music what so ever, but I know the feeling Kara felt buying those tickets and seeing here excitement put a huge smile on my face ☺️
skipping through this one...boring. ME ME ME!!!
Aww I've been waiting for the video with you grandpa!❤
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH IM SO EXCITED When i saw this vid pop up I was so excited about van life THEN you said sarah and Dusty I got EVEN MORE EXCITED then Bec and her family AND A BIKE RIDE ACCROSS THE US WTF IM SO EXCITED
I hope you’re going to include at least a part of the Great Allegheny Passage on your adventure!
SO EXCITED FOR VAN LIFE SEASON 3!!!!!!
23:25  It looks like the badlands, I’ve been to the badlands np!
So happy for Kara to see Adele 😍
Road trip! ❤❤❤❤
Should you stop in Damascus VA. Please come by The Damascus Old Mill Inn. You can camp in the parking lot, dinner and drinks on me!
omg Kara at Adele 😭😍🥂💜😭😭😭
I had Adele as my ringtone....  😶‍🌫️  10years ago
I every time I click on your channel I just have so much anticipation on wether it’s a van video or not and when it is I make some popcorn throw the pillows onto my chair and I get ready for a noice movie on my pc (also I was doing what I always do and then I see out the corner of my eye it is a van life video and I chucked the popcorn in the microwave this time)
You guys I was really ,really hoping you would get back to Van life , it’s so much better than jet setting Around the world! So love you doing this ,now what Iv been waiting for ,so let’s watch this video ,thank you so much ! 👏👏👏👏👍💖💖
First video of yours in 5 months that I have clicked on let alone watched because I CAN'T that thing on Nate's face!!! I used to look forward to your videos each week but, now I can't even look at the thumbnail if it has Nate in it.
Nate : Pleeeeeaaaaaaaaaase cut off that pornstache !!!
2. Be able to travel that well even if. Some? Of it is left. Out how powerful is it to see other couples enjoying america?
What's with all the Nate-hate for the Show-me state??? 😂 hello from STL!
You were in CO again and I missed yall?!!?!?!
Kara you stayed at Hays, KS Walmart.  The Tigers are Fort Hays University.
Okay once again , Wow.🎉🎉🎉🎉
These simple, classic K+N videos with daily life — nothing fancy — are my favorites. Love seeing you relate to one another. Come spend some time in Kansas sometime, though!
I'm blown away and kinda sad how much Adele tickets are 😢
Im so excited!  ❤️
Much Love from Colorado ❤ Colorado Cellars 🍷
Wohooooo VAN LIFE is baack 😍😍
I'd forgotten how fun the state crossings were! :)  Are you going to get a chance to see the Eclipse on the 14th?
Yes I’ve been waiting for this video ❤😊
Utahs use to be life is elevated but the people in charge of it decided to change it. We all hate it
Pretty sure I was parked by you at a Cracker Barrel maybe early Sept, can’t even remember where. Was laying in my van and thought I heard Nate’s voice outside. Didn’t think much of it since I thought you were in Bali or somewhere lol. Now that I’ve watched this, just might have been you.
Kara could at least told Nate thank you when he handed her er coffee!!!
I thought you were going to shave your bacteria trap, I mean mustache 😂. Great video good luck on your adventure!
My husband has ridden across the south and the north of the US when he was younger. Excited for the videos.
11:13  XDDD THE “lol” I CANTTTT 😂😂😂😂
OMG, this adventure sounds so freaking epic I love it and I'm jealous, I can't wait to see the videos
Yayyyyyy 🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤
YAY!!!!
Still kinda salty you haven't visited Michigan 😂 you're missing out!
I'm secure enough to admit that Nate is a good looking dude BUT, you both know that the SERIOUSLY HOT Kara is the reason we all watch the episodes
Every dollar I save for van life is easier when I watch these videos! I MISSED ITTTT!! Thanks guys. GOOD LUCK! ❤
Lol I thought the big announcement was Kara’s pregnant oof
YAYYYY THERYE BACK IN THE VANNN😆😁😁😁😁😁😁😊😊😊🤗🤗🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
I can relate to Kara, I don’t want to climb 14k foot mountain , and continues drinking her coffee .😂
You both are so amazing love your videos, Stay safe out there safe travels. Keep up the good work. Missed seeing you both in the van again.
I'm all about Adele too!! 🎉
I heard old run down hotel. I was expecting a lesser known hotel. Then nate dropped  circus circus. I was literally about to comment for y'all to go there. But fun fact. My dad just  retired as the head carpet installer from there.
Cool vlog!
Nate and Kara. I finally figured out why i love you guys ( other than you both are so easily lovable and the fact that youre good people) is because you enjoy life so much and the true love you share which btw at my age 58 i know does not come without commitment respect and struggles. ) life is what you make it and happiness is an inside job etc . Ive always struggled with depression since i was 12 and even though im happier now than ever ive missed so much and i feel so sad and guilty that i didn't wasnt able to really enjoy life and people. Ive been very blessed and will never stop trying to feel right and i just wanted to thank you for giving me joy and vicariously living as future ( old) Kara lol and Nate. I wish you both the best in life. Youre both such beautiful loving people . ❤
We love you two ! pure excitement!!!
So excited to be experiencing this trip in /almost/ real time. I found your videos for van life well after you guys have traveled without it (even though I love all of your videos!) I can't wait to see this crazy trip ahead ♥
LOVE seeing you back in the van!!!
Kara spending the whole day belting Adele, then running through the casino to the Adele concert, then crying while watching Adele live, made my entire day.
Vegas born speaker here, circus circus has been old looking for a long time now, but it does have a special place in my heart lol
Curious - are y'all driving the bike from DC to the Atlantic Ocean or are you just going to dip it in the Potomac River and call it a day? 😅
Y’all are crazy and I love it. Totally looking forward to all the videos to come. Safe tri-cycling?!
Kara’s joy for Adele is unmatched!
Seeing this video really makes me want to take a road trip to California!!  and I'm here in Texas.  Lots of fun, crazy, silly, fun!!  Bike safe...hopefully!
i love adele wish i could of been there but i live in new zealand
You guys are the best. You guys make my day. Don’t give up on what you do. When things are tough you push yourself to do it.
Oh my gosh did not disappoint!!
Oh my GOSH. That cracker barrel in St. Louis is right across the highway from my mom's. Why didn't you call me and tell me you were here?? 🤣
Karas pure happiness at the adele Concert was priceless
Believe it or not, I thought Nate was going to say “sometimes thing’s just work out fast-even though I didn’t read or follow any instructions “……(Solar Panels)   Gosh, and this was after you deemed the home of the “Dirt Dobber” a piece of dirt & threw it out!  I’ve got two thing’s to re-examine now, Adele & cooking my own Tofu!  I conquered Sriracha a few days ago after having “withdrawals” for weeks, and made my own…..Surely I can make my tofu look like Kara’s!  I can’t wait for more “Van Life”!!  🚵‍♀️🚵🚐
On your travels y'all should visit the Meow Wolf exibits! There's one in Vegas I'm visiting next week lol
OMG watching this was sooooo emocional and i don't even know you guys, but i feel so happy for you! also, i think Kara looks GORGEOUS and i think it was the days in Bora Bora! just saying jaja Saludos desde Chile! love you guys
Nate, you need to try more pancakes my dude...
Everything about this makes me excited! Van Life is back!!!! Rick and family are back!!!!! The Ragbrai video was my favorite and now to know you all are doing a cross country! I’m soooo excited for this!
Imagine u guys would do vanlife Europe, how fun would that be 😍
The circus circus hotel is haunted i believe so hopefully nothing follows you
When did you film this because I’m going to be so sad if I missed you come through Indiana on the bike!  Love seeing you guys back on the road.  So much fun!
My husband and I started traveling for work this year and every time we cross state lines we do the chant because of you all ❤
Utah: Welcome to cult country!
i have been missing your vanlife a lot. I think this is so much more interesting (sorry)
I am sooooooooo excited, and seeing y’all be sooo happy make me soooo happy!! And I ABSOLUTELY KNEW what y’all were doing and I’m soooo excited!!!
More stupid challenges ?
I almost cried when Kara did .. Adele is just something else!
"The Show Me State" makes me laugh every time I hear it.  A million years ago I was in boot camp for the Navy.  We had a girl in our company that had been a stripper.  We could not keep clothes on that girl.  She still had a tanning-bed tan line of a playboy bunny on her bikini line.  Note that she was not particularly shapely, attractive, or intelligent... but she was exuberant and perpetually naked.   Good times.
thank goodness for the mute button
Im so excited for you both and i love how excited kara was to see adele love you both from La Ronge Saskatchewan
Whoa, why did I tear up when Kara got to the concert ?! I’m not usually a weirdo lol
YAYYYYY VANLIFE RETURNS!!
Yyyyyayyyyyyyy
You don't know how happy I am that u guys came back to he van <3 Love u guys sm
You guys should take the van up here to Alaska!
Dont you need numberplate on van?
You need to come back to Kansas City sometime!
Are you going to have meet ups in the different states?
I though they were going to announce a pregnancy, LOL
I had a feeling the van life will eventually come back to Kara and Nate..
Miss the vanlife videos, glad you are back to the van 😀😀
So adorable when kara is excited 😊
I'm just seeing how everyone are happy to see Kara enjoy the concert...which I'm really happy about...but look at nate! He loves her so much that seeing her happy makes him happy❤ you're lucky kara🫶
The landscape at timecode 16:30 reminds me of the film "True Grit" with John Wayne🙂
These are my favorite of your adventures!!  So excited for these upcoming videos!!
pretty sure Eamon is shaking his head at the drawer section.....
With you, Kara, when an opportunity to see Adele live happens, you must take it.
Ooooooo can’t wait. You got to love are ADELE. X
yessss
Wait so are Sarah and Dusty full/part-time van-lifers now?? When did they get a van?
🇿🇦♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️💝💝‼️‼️‼️
I missed the van so much. SO MUCH!
Good luck! I hope you do awesome! I watched your ragbria video and have wanted to do it! Now maybe this?
Love to see y’all back in the van! Kara’s excitement for Adele was my excitement for Celine Dion when I saw her. Made me so pumped for you kara!
yall know how to fkn live. I love it so much. Thank you for years of content 🫶🏾
You guys are the best Thanks for sharing your life & adventures with so many. I was just incredibly blessed to see Switchfoot 2 days ago so I am still on the concert high. They are my what  Need to Breathe is to you guys as I was volunteering for Creation West hospitality for 10 years and got to know the Jon, Tim & the guys. I can't wait to watch this epic trip. I am always sending good thoughts for safety in all your travels.
I hate it when people say "you make it look easy" but your editing  packs in a ton of territory and excitement so effective and concise that all I need to watch  is a cup of coffee on a Sunday morning to kinda feel like I was there.
When  you are half way through planning 3 different trips and you suddenly remember it's new vlog day, so you abandoned everything and head to YouTube! Eeeeeeek! Wait, I remember the insta stories. I need snacks!!
I loved this ep!!! In Colorado You guys should hike hanging lake!!
Not the show me state slander 😭😂
So refreshing to see you back in the van after most vanlifers have suddenly quit the life😅
Haha, take 8hrs why rush
You guys are so much fun. I loved seeing Kara so excited for Addel, her smile was contagious. Thanks for sharing. Love ya, Nancy
You guys need to re-do your PCH trip
Sorry Kara, but i would have to ask to never put your feet/ shoes on the dash. Love the videos though
Kara, we all know what “me time” means! 😂 hope you had fresh batteries girl! 😜
I’ve missed K+N vanlife!!!! And so looking forward to a van trip with Papa Buchanan!!!! 😍 the look of joy on Kara’s face when Adele starts singing!!! Omg!
Kara's pure joy about Adele is EXACTLY how I would be if I got the chance to see her! 🤩
MEDICINE HAT TIGERS?  GOD LOVES YOU & SO DO I
♥♥♥
Ever since yalls episode of surviving on the island with nates parents, i can't unsee nate as his dad when he's building/working on things lol. Thank you guys for making weekend mornings fun! Your videos always make me so happy! P.S. I keep wearing my FareDrop shirt to the airport on every work trip in hopes of running into yall 🤣🤣
I live in Oceanside 🎉
I love these videos! I'm excited for the bike trip, but even more for Nate's van trip with his grandpa!!!!
lol I love these videos! You just need a new van though! Haha!
YAYYYY I MISS THE VAN
tha fact that kara got to see adele makes me heart so happy. my two favs in the same room ❤
I love this series! I just moved from southern Missouri not far from stl all the way to southern Oregon in 2020 ❤
oh my gosh adele is my absolute favorite and i even have a fan page for her. The pure excitement kara shares is so infectious and i love it.
This is what I've been waiting for let's goooooooo
I love when people cry because they are so excited!  Beautiful :)
"Most ambitious" because 100 country's was easy??
How Kara excitement when see is seeing Adele it made me tear up
She’s done ok for an Essex Girl eh? Concerts in Las Vegas…love love love Adele too 🎉
How are you sooo excited to see Adele? 🎉It’s not like you’re seeing Usher (who is also in residency). 😂😅
2 years since van life & the Baja trip?! NO WAY?! Safe travels across America & hope you stop in the Mitten soon!
You are the best people  In the world you rock
I LOVE YOUR VANLIFE CONTENT!!! I watch your old vanlife vids all the time, now I canwatch new ones! ❤❤
I miss Van life videos
Not gonna lie, you guys might have the smoothest transitions into the smoothest sneaky good ads that don't feel like ads. Tell your sponsors you guys are definitely worth it
Can’t wait for next video with Pop!!❤
I just went to Colorado over the summer. I for really light headed and sick. We went 12000 ft up the mountain. My heart beat fast and it was a struggle to breath a slow hike for sure.
yayyy i missed van life!!! Your video's make me happy ❤
Love it!
YOU GUYS WERE ON I24?!! I live a mile off Exit 11!
When I tell you my jaw DROPPED when yall said y’all are gonna bike across the us I mean i screamed! I’m SO EXICTEDDD!!
14:20 Go Tigers🎉 Nate, think about living in a state where you say “Show Me” and going to college as did, Go Tigers
Looks like its too late, but its usually a good idea flush out the old gas in the tank. The Ethanol turns fuel bad after like 6 months. If you're planning on parking it for an extended period, adding fuel stabilizer can help. 👍
My son and myself visited Vegas in August , we are from Australia and stayed at the Circus Circus Hotel , I thought it was a good hotel 😀
So happy for Kara❤ can’t wait for van lifeee…missed it so muchh😭safe travel guysss…love from 🇮🇳
Is it a 6 week bike ride across America?
The couple from The Endless Adventure stayed here recently! They said it was kind of shady, but it worked out fine lol.
I swear you are sitting next to my chiropractor Dereck Totty, or his identical twin.
Omg so boring...
VAN LIFE FINALLY!!!
Nate, what’s the story on your 1987 Casio watch?   Is it a family heirloom?
I'm sure you recycled the boxes, right? 😮
I've been wondering how your friends from CO have been.
Kara's reaction to the Adele concert put a huge smile on my face.  Adele is one of my favourite singers too, she sounds angelic.
You know we all do that thing with yelling out the states on road trips now, right? 😂
So excited for the new adventure! Let’s go guys! ❤❤❤
What a shame dusty and Sarah were left out of the entire video !!
Omg I miss van life so much!!!! Yayyyyyy
As a fellow Adele fan I can totally relate with Kara! I managed to see her on the last tour she did and she is just unreal!
Omg omg I have been waiting for this
Yes!! Kansas! I am from Kansas City. 🎉
I'm super excited for your bike trip!!
WHAT??? i wish i didn’t have to wait til i get home to watch this because this sounds very intriguing…
This is fun
Is anything ever simple?
Hi Kara and Nate! I found you guys on 2021 and I LOVE the van videos 🫶 I'm sure the other travel vids are fun but I never watch them! Just wanted you to know this is my favorite content you guys post 🥰❤
the draw isn't in the rails lol good try though
I’ll admit, I drifted from your channel.  But I’m so happy to see the van again! Even for a wee while…
You guys are the best x
Hey Kara and Nate please say hi to me and me and my dad love watching you
By your map,  you will be dipping into the Chesapeake Bay....not the Atlantic Ocean.   Head to Virginia Beach for the Atlantic Ocean.
I honestly got chills and misty-eyed when Kara was enjoying the Adele concert.  ❤ you guys!
14:09 "I have no idea where we are." You're in my home town lol. The Tiger is the mascot for Fort Hays State University in Hays KS.
Yay..!! Vanlife vids are my absolute fav (except ones from the UK 😉)
I was lucky enough to see Adele in concert about 8 years ago in Toronto.  Best concert ever.  She makes a large venue seem small and like she is singing and talking to you. So happy you got to see her!
I live in a class A. Thank God I looked away just before the grey water clog! Dude! A little longer heads up please. 🤢
like the video other than the hate on missouri lol
9:00 CROSSING INTO ANOTHER STATE TRADITION  Talk about competitive 😅  My family : We stay really quite if 1 of us sees the state border...  The only thing that let's others know that it's coming is the person that saw it is reaching as far past everyone to the front of the vehicle to get there 1st. 😂  Usually it gets noisy after someone notices, 🙄 I usually keep my foot way under the dash, so I always get to the next state 1st 😂
I like the van life better
I was sitting at the exact same seats last month!! Did Sarah and Dusty request not to be in the video?
16.58 mins in and guessing hiking the Pasific Crest Trail?
Tearing up already watching preview of camping trip with Grandpa…. Love you guys❤
Best episode of the entire year 😍😍😍😍😍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Leaving "Colorful" Colorado and everything was dead brown! LMAO. As a resident of Colorado, I have to admit  that it basically stopped raining three months ago, so dead brown it is!
You guys are AMAZING. Love the switching between Kara in the Van and the Mountainside!
I followed you specifically for van life but kept with you on your travels just cause your videos are so damn entertaining but this video made me super giddy to see another van life adventure.
Love you you guys!!! Have a safe fun and fantastic trip!!!
So Leadville gravel? Oh wait, this is way better, I'm a big cyclist and I hope you love it!
Banger video
The sphere
You telling about your trip with your Grandpa is an answer to my prayers.  I so didn't want you to miss out on that special time with Your Grandpa, and I prayed that He would get to see that wish fulfilled.  I'm bawling as I type this comment.  We Love you Papa Buchanan
VW all the way  can't wait for the papa vid
I cannot wait to see how grandpa is in the VW Bus 😭🥺 I've been waiting for this Nate! It'll be wholesome.
Every other van lifer has stopped to homestead or have kids
So excited to see your van/u.s. episodes :) Take care :)
Yall are such awesome people 😘
You know Kara’s excited when that accent comes out 🤣
I just love watching yall so much, you guys make my day and your guys camera work is amazing 🤩
Do a meet up / victory party in Washington DC on the National Mall. 😀 Epic!!!
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Kara and Nate are going to bike up and down Pikes Peak
My wife and I from 9/5 - 9/18 drove from Tampa to Glacier National Park. Stopping off in rapid city area  to see Mt Rushmore, deadwood, Sturgis, and the badlands, then continuing on to glacier. After all that, we drove back. Total was 6200 miles. Part of our bucket list.
My state has the best slogan, Land of Enchantment 😁
Funds have finally run out
Wait, did Dusty and Sara get their own van???? (maybe should wait to watch whole video but I'm too excited!)
I've hiked a few 14ers. They are a worthy adventure. Seeing Adele would be incredible! ❤
Hey there, if you ever van back to the ElVee you are welcome to park out front of my house in a gated community just off the strip.
WOW what a trip! You guys make vanlife look amazing. I can't wait to see your buddy bike trip! I'm a week and a half out of my double mastectomy. Lots more cancer journey to go. Please keep posting the happy life.
i loveeeee van life videossssss
Updates on Tiktok too?
OMG been waiting for this especially the part where you watched the concert of adele
Just wanted to say how funny it was on day three for me. I was trying to figure out why that cracker barrel you guys where staying at looked so familiar its because I work there. 🤣
So happy to see you two back in the van, but that crack in your windshield just kick my anxiety in 😢.  Stay safe looking forward to watching the new adventure ❤️
You should make a quick drive from DC to Delaware at the end of the bike trip.  Still crossing off states ?  And don’t do New Castle county, you’ve got to visit Slower Lower DE.  Rehoboth, Bethany, Fenwick … dip your toes in the Atlantic 😁
Omg I have been waiting for you to get back to van life and the day has finally came. 🎉🎉😂
SO SO EXCITED for your van trip with your pops Nate 🥹👴🏼
Can’t wait the next few videos!! If u ever move to boulder colerado that would be amazing videos!!
I'm disappointed Kara didn't get to hug or at least hold Adele's hand 😢 Next time, okay?
Please don’t touch the headlight bulb when you change it.  It drastically decreases the lifetime.
Nice to have you back can-lifing. However, why are you two still “struggling” with your van. With your viewership and ventures, pony up and buy a top of the line van.
Grandpa video 🥰
We appreciate all yous do!
I live near DC. I want to be there to cheer you into the finish “line”!!!!
So excited for more van life!
9:16 yay! Kentucky! My state! I live in Louisville!!!
Yaaayyyy finally
I'm so excited for this series! I thought you were going to finally drive the pacific coast highway.
8:16 are ya’ll buying a house on Cali???
Loved this video and totally made my day!  Thanks for sharing! :)
I wish I got that excited over something
You guys were staying at the Cracker Barrel in Missouri that’s 2 miles from my house! Hope you guys enjoyed yourself
The best moment was getting away from Vegas parking lot without getting riped off 🤣👍
NO WAY you guys were in oceanside literally one week before i was there visiting my family, my uncle has been a city planner there for years, can't wait to see where this new adventure takes you!
❤
I was in tears watching Kara in tears for Adele. I'm glad it was everything you've dreamed of. Can't wait for the camping trip with pops & good luck on the bike trip (y'all are crazy ❤️)
The guy beside you at the concert needed to get the stick out of his a** .      You two had an amazing time!    Love Adele ❤️
Oh my gosh I have been waiting for your adventure with your grandfather!! So excited!!
@22:52 lemme send this to the geoguesser guy...bro will find it in seconds😂
You guys are lunatic for the group bike trip, but it’s exciting too! Best of luck!
I love Kara and Nate. But kara’s reaction and impulse to buy Adele is so pure I love it sm- big up the UK 🇬🇧
Oh my gosh!!!!! So excited!
❤️ you guys! Ok… who’s going to tell them that the Atlantic Ocean is about 2 hrs past DC by car? 🤣 You got this!
Love the van life! And I do think you're right I think taking breaks gives you a deeper appreciation for it. It's also the closest thing you guys have to a home.  I don't know if you guys are ever planning to complete the 50 State challenge but I'd love to see you try can life in Alaska and Hawaii. Given your Love of hiking and surfing I think you would have a great time and both of those places
Omg I live in Oceanside and I love y’all so cool you guys came out here I used to live in Nashville and the drive is a hard one lol !!
This is amazing!
awwwwh i love the current relationship you guys have with van life, i cant explain it but it feels healthy and homely!
Nate’s face when Kara was driving singing her music. 😂
I MISSED VAN LIFE!!!!!!!!
Looking forward to the video with your grandfather!!!!
I’m so happy Vanlife is back!!!!!
i absolutely adore your channel!
When you get to Illinois, try to find a sandwich called Italian Beef. It’s obviously not for vegans, but if anybody eats meat in your group, it’s an Illinois staple!
I love Adele she is fantastic.
🐾I love how you embrace every day! And the Blue’s Clues were epic!!! 🐾
How did you figure out the spelling of the puking noise?!?!?! 😝 🤣 😂
bonus points using the original blues clues guy 👏
You know why that bed is more comfortable than the Marriott?! I’m gonna tell you why lol 😂 It’s because that’s y’all’s home I mean you made it and put so much work into it like you would a house and nothing is more comfortable than you’re home!! 😊🤗
Going above 10,000 feet on your first day in Colorado is uncomfortable. Ask me how I know!
So excited to watch the Pops video. He is so cute Nate!! Also, really excited for the biking across America series. You guys are killing it!!
I used to live in oceanside!!! Usmc❤
Yay!!
Next time you are in Vegas, stay at the Oasis RV Resort.  It's on the south end of the strip, very nice ad quiet, full hookups, pool ect.   We stay there every time we are headed east.  Great video as always!
Van life Kara and Nate are my favorite Kara and Nate! So excited to see you back in the van!!!
You got this 🎉
yes yes YESSSS!!! dude you have no idea how much I’ve wanted y’all to get back to van life!! IM SO HAPPYYY 🩵🩵 y’all even brought the cardboard list back 🥹
I first discovered y'all through your Colorado bike trail series! So happy to see the van life coming back
I watch 5 minutes of your video and 5 minutes of Eamon and Becs! Lol the back and fourth is giving me whiplash and I love it! My Sundays kick sooo much ass because of you all! ❤ SO much love and admiration from Canada ❤
Kara’s excitement for Adele is EVERYTHING!!! She is my dream artist to see! Living completely vicariously through you on this one Kara! ☮️❤️🎶
So cool
Okay, I’ll start listening to Adele again 😭🥺
🧡💓💜💓💚
I lived in palisade Colorado all growing up , I have never had a chance to go back , given the chance it would be a life long dream of mine. I can’t believe you went there. Love you guys ❤❤❤❤
Adele has an amazing beautiful spirit with sugar and spice ❤️ Can't wait to see rhe van trip with pop!!
Love the van trips the most. Have fun.I would Die. I adore Adele.......
Every time Kara is drinking a coffee my 3 year old says “she’s drinking coffee!” Which I find hilarious since we all know how much Kara needs her coffee 😂
I am so excited for this adventure! I'm so glad van life is back :)
Yes
Nate looks better WITHOUT the moustache.
‘There is an old run down hotel Circus  Circus ‘- I stayed there in 2018 (and yes it was old!)😅😅
I love how adventurous you both are. And we you adventure with this team it's always a great ride. Looking forward to watching your journey
Oh Kara...I just loved your enthusiasm and how absolute awestruck you where for Adele❤ she is the sweetest!!! I am so glad you got to experience that🤩🥰 so excited for the bike trip yall got this 💪🏽🚲 Stay awsome and stay safe!!!🙏🏻❤
I've got to admit I am no "fan" of anyone but Adelle definitely has my admiration. You said it Kara... "Funny, spicy and beautiful". All the best to you all.

I'm so excited to be back in van life with you guys!😊😊
O-side??? That’s in my neck of the woods!
How do you cope with jet lag when travling so much always wondered?

Keep it going
Brace yourself for burst pipes, burnt stuff, broken down fridges, no running water, uncomfortable beds and gas leaks round 2, lads.
I love these videos!!!
Glenwood Canyon. Best place ever. Wanna bike that path that goes along it
I love you guys and maybe I just have never noticed it but the "pop up" sound you put throughout the video was too much lol please cut back. Only negative thing I will ever say you're both amazing!
Good luck guys ❤
Very very beautiful country 😍😍😍 wonderful place 🥰🥰🥰 my dear friend 🙏❤️🌺💐
I love that you're back in the van!  Missed Kara's cooking! 😊
Salam alaikum 🙏🙏
I’d spend a day with a dog rather than hike up a mountain.
I love you guys!!
Love it! So happy to see this! I've been following on IG and you're in Utah now. Love Adele...!
Enjoy your bike ride and be safe ❤.
I’ve been watching all the updates on Instagram

I've said to myself a few times that I missed watching you guys and can life. I'm going to enjoy watching the next chapter 💖
I can’t believe they are coming to my hometown 11:57
We don’t always comment, but we watch your videos religiously! So excited to follow your journey across the US! When you get done in D.C. , come dip your bike tires in the Atlantic Ocean in Ocean City, MD! We will celebrate with you! 🥳
Omg yes I loved when you lived in van life!!
I completely her love for Adele. You should do a separate video of the concert and share it with us that will never ever be able to attend a concert.
I'm so freaking excited! Van life and an adventure with Sarah, Dusty, Rick and Beck!?! Those two types of videos were always my favorite!
Oh Mah Goodness! Is it real 🤗 yay! Happy to follow along on your adventure
YESSSS ... absolutely love you guys on the Road ❤️ .. it truly is testimony to the both of you that you didn't let the lavish lifestyle get to your heads! ❤
Have y’all listened to Office Ladies podcast? 10/10 would recommend
Y’all drove through my hometown Escondido California
Omg you're back to your van
This is the video we didn’t know we needed❤
Oh man gawd what an awesome trip!!! Coolest adventure yet for sure!!! ❤   can't wait to watch along!!! ❤❤❤
😂😂of all the signs you recorded the one IN VEGAS “BOOBS” WAS THE ONE THAT MADE E LAUGH SO HARD
AWWW my heart just about melted when nate explained the video with his pop! I wait🥺💓
This distraction is soooo welcome from the war here in Israel! Thank you guys so much!
Hey that’s awsome. I hope I guyz have fun enjoy ur trip. Safe travels. 😊😮
I cried just hearing you talk about the video with your grandpa. Can't wait to see it.
So so happy❤
Dangit, I'm not on Instagram,  it your map says you're coming through Indiana.....Columbus, by chance??
That’s going to be me if I ever get to see Adele
Only Kara and Nate would arrive at an Adele concert via a mountain and a national park ❤
The Tiger’s gear is for Fort Hays State University, which is where I went to college.  Go tigers!   Ps-love your content ❤️❤️❤️
Would love to show y'all around San Diego when you're in the area!
So happy van life is back!  I stayed at Circus Circus's no frills RV park.
I’m so happy for you Kara I’m crying for you my biggest hope is to to watch Adele in concert just cost to much to squeeze into the budget glad I get to live three u
Great video!  We barely saw Sarah and Dusty.  Update?  They have a van?  Are they doing van life?
0:20
YOU must be born again.
I love the van life ❤
YAY !
Is there anything you guys do that isn’t the best thing? 🤷‍♂️
I'm so excited for these upcoming videos!!
I watched this whole video, cracking up, and just loving it! 😂❤ you two are the best!😊 now you just gave the reveal and yall are crazy!
Love it❤
you should visit Cerro Gordo Mines :)
I was watching this and it was 20 mins after it was uploaded, i just kept on going back to Kara's experience watching Adele, the reason being was i think, this is going to be me if I see you guys, i will probably be crying and overwhelm, which is kind of impossible as I am in the Philippines and have cancer and somehow struggling. but your videos are more than enough for me :)  Love you Kara and Nate. Thanks for inspiring me
Sooo cool. Thanks for sharing!
And to think the titans are playing in Adele’s home town next week
IM SO HAPPY THAT VAN LIFE IS BACK! I missed it so much and i hope you guys have so so much fun on all the adventures you guys will go on! Good luck!❤
I'm saving for Vanlife, in order to get out of Kentucky, and this has made me realize how badly I want this dream to become true!!! ❤
Never heard anyone cheer for Illinois before 😂
Really looking forward to what's to follow! ❤
I love all your videos but this one moving back into the van just makes me so dang happy. ❤
I love your videos! I watch you every day!

I think you guys have something against Kansas and Missouri! I feel offended! lol
Hey, u didn't put clean chemrx on the list. 😂
The merch that says "Go tigers" actually refers to a college in Hays, KS called Fort Hays State University, actually don't live far from there.👍👍❤
This is really exciting! I've loved the other modes of travel, but van life is always a joy to see again!
I can't believe i've been watching you guys for so long... and now back to VAN LIFE AGAINN!! let's GOO!
Van life

My jaw dropped when I saw the title! I haven’t watched the video yet so I’m excited!
HII KARA AND NATEE
Omg that's one of my favourite episodes of your adventures ever, can't wait for more❤
I watch your channel with my little brother and we love you guys so much :)
Omg i was waiting for this video (I saw that you guys were doing vanlife on insta )
I want to imagine viewers who are not from the US being pleasantly perplexed by our state border crossing traditions as Americans 😂
LOVE this. If you go through Columbia, MO, we live right off the Katy Trail in the country and have room for 3 vans! Would love to host you. 🙂
I don’t typically comment on videos, but I’ve been watching you guys for years now! The energy and strength in your relationship is such an inspiration. I couldn’t be anymore excited about van life being back, safe travels Kara & Nate!
Seeing Kara cry tears of pure joy at the Adele concert was so heartwarming! She deserves it! 💜 Edit: YOU GUYS ARE CRAZY!!! The WHOLE country?! Wow. Well, if anyone can do it (and with great attitudes), it’s you guys. Sincerely, best of luck & for goodness sake be careful! Love from Ohio! 💜😳
Kara…I don’t blame you about Adele…she’s amazing!
Seeing Kara at the Adele concert is just the most precious thing !
You were right down the highway from my house in Missouri!!!! ❤❤❤
Omg I am so happy that van life is back love y’all so much 😊
Van life 🎉🎉🎉I am so happy to see you are back in the states again 🎉🎉
44 min ago😮
what an adventure!!
Would’ve died if I saw Adele live
This was probably one of my more favorite videos, good luck on the trandem
On a trike you say, reminds me of the goodies!! Hopefully you won't be fighting a giant rabbit or a giant cat. Now you just have to decide who is Bill, who is Graeme and who is Tim. I guess Nate will be Tim with the facial hair. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goodies
Great video, so good!! Very envious of your Adele concert!!
OMG IM SO EXCITED!!!!!
I’m so thrilled with how long this one is! Rainy day here. Such a nice Sunday to snuggle in and watch
I don't think I have ever seen Kara nerd out about anything like this.
I ❤❤❤love you guys are back in the van!!!! The best adventure ever…😜  🚴 🚴 🇺🇸 best vlog..so much emotions..Adele concert, biking across America and the Pop vlog. You guys are the best!!
Love the content! Keep up the great work!❤
Been waiting for the episode with your grandpa ^^
I LOVE IT!!! SENDING GOOD THOUGHTS<3
I totally forgot about your van life LOL
Kara's default dialogue for all video "best day ever"😆😆
i love when the big to do list comes out!
'i dont like pancakes...' the hell you say
The next adventure looks like CdawgVA cycle-thon on steroids.
I have lived in Utah most of my life and could not have told you our motto was industry. We're "The Beehive State" and our sign says "Life Elevated" which isn't all that much better 😅
I've missed van life.
I love van life to the top of my heart and back! We all appreciate you guys so much! 😁❤
I’ve missed seeing the van sooooo much!!!! ❤
YESS VAN LIFE!!!  so excited
I would love to meet you!
It's great to see you guys back in the van. I love you a'll.
VanLife is everything!!! ❤ 🚐
Circus circus I believe is haunted in some ways too .. I’ve watched a lot paranormal investigators explore there , and seen some interesting things lol   Keep up the hard enjoy full coverage 💪✌️✊🕉️🫶💯
Love Leadville! I lived there for many years and worked at all the ski areas n had a house there in the 80’s . Enjoy and safe travels !

Van life is back, I’m so happy ❤
Love you guys! More adventures! 💕💕
Kara and Nate, I love you, but I'm so glad you missed the CA state line because thats the most annoying thing ever whenyou say the state names!!! ❤😅
I traveled and lived in my ambulance fulltime from January to august. In august I sadly totaled my home in an accident. Luckily, I’m currently building out another ambulance and you guys make me so excited to get back on the road during a time when the stress of a new (unexpected) build is constant. Thank you for sharing your adventures ♥️
❤❤❤ your doing something I have been dreaming about!!! (Going by bike) Good luck on the journey! looking forward to seeing the terrain and how it's goes! Happy riding.
YAAAYYYY Van Life!!!!!!! 🎉❤
Diesel in California is almost 7$ a gallon 🥲
Aww you guys visited St.Louis!! I hope you guys enjoyed your little stay in the “Show me state” still have no clue why we’re called that and I’ve lived here my whole life lol. Love you guys💕💕
I live for these van vids!

You NEED to finish all of the 50 states. I’ve been waiting for you to do Michigan!
Do you know how excited I was when I saw this I literally was clapping my hands so fast that I almost fell off the bed and I also love your guises channel❤
Seeing how happy Kara was at the concert made me tear up 🥹 so glad to be able to watch your experiences ❤️
Kara your hair is always so cute! What styling tools do you bring with you while traveling/on the road?
Hi I love your vids ive been watching you guys for a while and welcome to colorado I live in denver❤😊 12:36
Have you been watching friends   Bc day 3 is called the one with pancakes   And most of the friends episodes start with the one with  ?    Edit: never mind pretty sure all the chapters are named like friends
just love adele ❤❤❤ oh, and K&N, of course
As safety, you should do holes where you propane tank is. So when it's leaking (Thats how propane tanks works and they will leak) the gas will go under your car through hole instead, since it's heavier than air
Excited about van life but even more to see how it goes with the following project ! Long distance riding is my thing but sharing a bicycle definitely is not, and I can't wait to see how it works out with you.
Are they doing Amazing race?
Soooo muuuch Loooove for you to magical Souls❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Seeing Kara’s pure excitement for Adele made my day❤
Seeing that appriciation of Adele made me love Kara even more ❤ Seeing your favourite artist is the best
Hi from Denver!🎉🎉🎉🎉 That is super brutal to do 14er right when you arrive, headache is altitude for sure. Be careful!
Wow, a new journey begins.  The views from the peak were amazing, but Kara, I would totally agree with you on having a “me” day, we all need one once in a while. ❤️🇨🇦
Come visit oregon ❤
Have fun your on the west coast finally
Vegas you go for Adel
Yeah Bugs~!! When I was young, (a long long time ago) Bugs on the windsheild were the norm. Now there is never a Bug. Ecosystem crashing. So Glad to hear there are Bugs somewhere to be pollinating our Food~!
Glenwood Canyon is the best. I was born in Glenwood Springs and moved back there in 1991 to go to college. So much to love about Colorado. 💖💗
Quick question for the European viewers: Can anyone pinpoint Kara's "british" accent to a specific area or is it just an odd amalgamation?? Lol love ya Kara 😋
I'm pretty sure, based on your ig stories, I know what your next adventure is .... 🚲 ➡️ 🇺🇸
I am so happy for you Kara that you were able to see Adele live! I'm sure I would've been crying with you if I was there too!
Yay!!!  I ❤ Sarah and Dusty!!!
Great to see you back on the road.Cant believe you didn't mention The Sphere which was just behind you at the carpark.x
I live in Colorado! :D
Wow, sounds like an epic trip. Love your videos so so much!
Cleaning the toilet is like jury duty.   No one wants to do it.  But it must be done!!!
Good luck on your journey guysssssss❤❤❤❤❤
90 $ for 20 gallons? In Europe (Croatia) we would pay around  130$ for that amount 😢😂
Love you guys
Love ur vids keep grinding
Very cool
Aww you guys came through St. Louis!! ❤
Can I also say I LOVE THE COFFEE ritual!!
So can Iowa (RAGBRAI) claim credit for this awesome idea?

That bolt is upside down?
You are never supposed to touch a headlight bulb with your fingers. The oil from your fingers will cause a hotspot and blow out. Take it back out, clean with rubbing alcohol and use a paper towel to install it or rubber gloves.
