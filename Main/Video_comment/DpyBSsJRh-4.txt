👍👍
Soon as he said they raided his home and found more charges the song "percocet..molly, percocet uh... percocet.. molly, percocet uh"
Young thug is a multimillionaire the poor young man my heart bleeds for him
Why are conditions in jail awful? The punishment is that your freedom is taken away. Creating inhumane conditions is revenge.
Young Thug's Lawyer asserts that there are "Dungeon Like Conditions" in the jail.  In other news, "Ocean Like" conditions have been reported at the beach.
Is he tweaking??
Someone should be charged for the lighting job on that judge
I guarantee the police have told this judge and all judges not to give him bond.. it’s the police who decide, not the judges and that’s the way it works everywere.. the police don’t want him winning or preparing well, so they want him in prison and I guarantee he will never get bond
🤍
🇲🇽💯he has a hat on his desk that says no self snitching 🤳 massive that's a classic 🇲🇽
Idgaf about thug he has killed many black men I think they said about 50 and other crimes too which black men were involved... You won't mind dropping the soap! Gtfoh........rott in piece!
I'm going to cross my fingers.... Hope he doesn't get out 😂
How many years Should somebody Expect for distributing  Marihuana? Thank you f
I used to actually live in zone 3 where the YSL and YFN gang war took place. I’ve hung out with rappers and gang members and based on some of the stories I’ve heard and the violence I’ve witnessed there, I hope these ppl are proven guilty and taken of the streets. I wouldn’t recommend living there, it’s no way to live.
You think the jail tour that they voluntarily did just proves the D.A. is deadass certain they got a case and they won't let them go?  This I'd love to see your opinion on... Cuz that jail tour was highly unusual
Judge needs to tell him "get used to it buddy because its your new home'!!!
damn man this sucks these guys are 2 of my favorites rappers, actual GOATs this is rough....
Anyways I know the system they have to go by a point and if it's points or not so high they still can put them on probation that's if he passed and don't get in trouble that's on him we are talking about two deaths of murder that someone killed two innocent people for what reasons why but they blaming this robber we are trying to prove that he did not kill nobody in his innocence. June 30th 2022 your voice count.
They should've called Bruce rivers!!
The funniest thing is that dungeons were designed to be jails
Can you break it down for the people so they quit saying free Young Thug.. lol.. YSL= You serving Life...Green screen judge who doesnt have the power to do anything without asking somebody else. What kind of judge is this @Bruce? Was she a majesty?
State or Fed Rico because it different level of problem s
If this lawyer is broadcasting your story you know it’s serious 🧐
If a lawyer can't defend two suspects then how are codependents even allowed. Oh wait they're not by anything other then force of habit
Jeffery needs my boy Bruce rivers on this case💯👌🏿
This is just so sad... even if you don't sympathize with Young Thug, at least sympathize with all of Thug's kids and the people who relied on him within his community. Young Thug's career is likely over at this point bc he could easily go away for 30 years. To see massive talents like him & Fetty Wap go down like this is just depressing for complex reasons... it's not as simple to say Young Thug shouldn't have committed these crimes. Like yes, he should NOT have committed them but when your environment since childhood molds you like this, it can become harder than one thinks to walk away from that lifestyle.
That's a awful lot a cough syrup🤣🤣 still need one of them fits
The goat
Stop self snitching??? How about *STOP COMMITTING CRIMES‼️‼️‼️*
I love Bruce 😂 We need more people like him lol
I still think it’s crazy how they can use lyrics to a song against you. That’s like saying every actor who’s killed someone in a movie or said they killed someone should be convicted too. It doesn’t make sense to me. I don’t think rappers should be self snitching though cause it’s just dumb but I don’t get how they’re able to use that against them. It’s a fuckin song 🙄 plus that’s also like saying every single thing everyone has ever said in a song has to be true & that’s just not the case.
One of my favorite things to do when I watch each video is looking at how snazzy those cufflinks always are
Gone for 15-25yrs
I hate this DA smh.
So glad to see Saul Goodman land on his feet and get his own YouTube show
What do her breasts have to do with anything ?
Thug and Gunna both taking plea deals after they’ve been debriefed
man lyrics jus entertainment …if an actor/actress gets arrested they don’t put up their past works as evidence idk tho
I thought I found my favorite Lawyer online - until I found this channel the other day. Love this guy's style. No BS
"Stop Self Snitching" This is so true. Lawyering at it best :-)
Watchbthe real #igotsomethangtasay
People are gettin hit w RICO charges kuz they kno NOTHING about the law.
Love those cufflinks mate. You always dress very sharp. Is that a day-date I see? Something with class without doubt
Bruce Rivers is the 🐐 - I would marry this man 💜😁😅
Can you react to the Grand Master Jay from NFAC ? Curious to know your thoughts.
Man, why wouldnt you flush the lean and ditch the guns ?
Idk why these rappers won't just benefit joining the army with this fetish for military artillery get paid for going to war instead of enslaved creating your own.
crying about the living conditions, shouldve thought about that b4 they started this gang ish, dont cry now, gang gang.
“Well the jail is uncomfortable so we’re going to release you” what adult thinks that would fly in a court of law? Wishful thinking for criminals
There is reason for the jails poor condition it is on purpose a deterent to ever come back uneducated Fulkerson should never sale drugs
Young Thug will be Old Broke Thug if he ever gets out
If we hop on patreon can you free Young Thug?
send him to jail and done     next up !
Young thug was DEFINITELY going through Opiate Withdrawal when he was in virtual court (Lean) I’ve been through it many times in court proceedings lol.
can you do a video on hoodrich pablo georgia rico case  wanna what happened bloods in atl as well
Bruce you stand to be corrected! Yall didn't beat him up yet, yall getting soft doesn't mean he directed anything,  and you should no better you're a lawyer. Here me guys. Have anyone ever had friends where something was done to them, and yo turn around in say , yo you didn't take care that punk mf? I know many who have done that, they didn't tell them to do anything, they're asking a question!
Call illuminati or sumthing....where birdman at I thought he was his nephew to him...seems like illuminati picks there artists matter if your famously
And understand these dudes don't have millions of liquid disposable money to up for the group of lawyers these dudes are gonna need to go up against state D.As and prosecutors...this will end up being picked up by the feds because crimes were committed over state lines and firearms and murder for hire.... definitely a snitch in the crew and YouTube are the DAs facts
So just like that officer Gotti threw thugg at the feds and you don't here about Dolph anymore
Free them guys
Why in thugs appearance did the judge talk directly to thugs lawyer, and in Gunnar’s appearance the judge differed to the DA . Or thru the DA seemed like? @CLRbrucerivers
America falling and they trying to take black folk with them, haha no no🤣🤣🤣🤣
Young thug locked up because the feds rounding up black people, all the rappers are locked up, what did they do?
That tie is FYEEE
Is that a gun on the desk? Surely not?!
Lol he's DONE going away long time thuggy
Real Talk
You say; You don't wanna see ANYBODY go to jail....are you implying that, criminals should have free reign, and crime should not be enforced???
Breakdown of maxo kream beating his rico case would be dope
Stop the violence
The consequences of living that gang gang "lifestyle🎶"
U heard the man. He ain't getting out of jail, Gunna ain't getting out of jail. How he said that got me😂😂😂😂....and yeah it's funny cause Young   Thug sound like he can't do no time
Explain the difference between, a federal Rico charge which has a 90% + conviction rate between a state rico charge. A lot of ppl have been saying state Rico charges are “easier” to beat
The worst thing these dudes got going for them in this case is having black women  working against them
You know, he deserves what he's getting. Like I can't feel sorry for these rappers anymore
Exactly if you can’t do the time then don’t do the crime I done sat in jail at 17 here in Texas on a felony drug charge got a 7 years 1st offense I knew what I was getting into but I learned young thug a cry baby
Nice tie
I heard gunna was released. 😮..... is he telling or naw?!? And I thought you could only use lyrics if they specifically contain the action of a crime that was actually committed?!? What if a rapper is just story telling and they say something that's makes it seem like they're the trigger puller?!? it doesn't make sense for them to be able to use lyrics... that's bs!
I don't think women should be judge's
Bruce can you please react to Super Gremlin by Kodak Black!!!!!!!!!
I need thug out pronto
Shiddd to b honest 🤔 Y didn’t thugger hire you 😂
Imagine 15 to 30 ppl walking into your office and handing you $2500 to $30,000 every month….
I hope they all get life
I said it from the start the feds will pick up this case. It’s coming!
Better call Saul
Fully automatic guns are less accurate. The weed and the gun charges are immoral charges.
They tell everyone involved with the law that Justice is blind and ignorance of the law is no excuse  which means study the law and don't trust your lawyer.or all your money will be gone  It's  just that sample .
Study your own case law,and try to find other white man with your same case. If you look you will find other white man in that state with much more Bader cases than your. Don't give up.
Stay strong  anyone down with this young man. Young  brothers please look for other lawyers. You must pit lawyers against each other. The same thing white man do.the court will try to lock a black man up for. That's why you must always look for other lawyers. And also
Break down big meech case too
IF only he did a Form 4 for that NFA weapon.
A great defense? Bruce what’s a good defense for having lots of illegal drugs and guns?
Possession of marijuana with intent to distribute- who cares. Killed me lmao
My man got an revolver on his desk ready.
Young thug wearing dresses in jail and getting his cheeks busted, He loving it
Free this man 😤
If Thugga and Gunna been doing ANY of the SHYT they being CHARGED with…Then Lock ALL their Sweet Black asses UP, Bruce 👀 🤦‍♂️ and this coming from a Black Man out of the South!!!
You don't wanna see him go to jail!!! So you cool with him having people shot and killed and beaten huh? You'll change that tune when it happens to your loved ones huh!!!
Keep self snitching alive…. 😊😊😊 all theose dumb asses need to go to jail
A Black judge....let's see how this goes. A magistrate???? Guinea pig
Just curious how much is your retainer
Man thug is fucked 😰
Freee YSL slatt slatt
I like this dude
This is bogus as we know it,  but sheer protocol... Young thug need to step to the plate and be responsible for his actions.. Yu want better gel conditions.??? $nitch..!!!  They'll send you to the Feds where you'll serve your time comfortably.. 😆😆 Dammit Boi..
Thug is a rapper or entertainer that want to be a mobb boss so bad.. 🤷 He's a dumb Street kid.
Love the thousands of daily subscribers you are getting, myself included. I've literally seen it go up several thousand over the course of one day it's amazing 👏🏼
I don’t know if you would see this but how do you feel with New York bill to stop prosecutors from using rap lyrics against them
Ima self snitch just so he can react to my shit
🗣 12:51
I was one of Bruce first subscribers I watch him grow to 500k Least he can do is give me a shout out
YOU ARE GREAT , THANK FOR EXPLAINING THA LAW
That stop snitching cap is 💣
This isn't the lawyer you don't want to represent you
These boys threw they life away.
Wds hit him hard in that cell
You can tell thug having opiate withdrawals look how he keeps moving in discomfort.
He’ll be okay, this is America don’t nobody who pays that much in taxes go to jail for long.
Unless i have some "additional authority to do so" remember that
You are on fire!!
Anyone else think of Key and Peele “rap album confession”? Lol
Your legal advice is very Basic. The question is how many Millions of Dollars it's going to take to get Jeffrey Williams out on Bond. He's going to Jail . He's needs to get a Bond to get his affairs in Order. That Prosecutor is trying to make a name for herself and become famous. This is the Nicky Barnes case  where they're going to convict everybody based on association.  The book has already been written before. This case is nothing new.
I suggest you read the book met your strawman.
She saying only federal court have jurisdiction in this matter. And basically why he in front of me?
I wonder what can of jurisdiction the state is moving under? First thing first.
Public safety. Why does the constitution/contract states an felony can only be committed on the high seas?
We're is the corpus delicti?  Bruce what is color of law?
U know what they say the blacker u are the higher risk of being attacked by the white man in MERICA!!
Bruce is lying when he says nobody cares about Marijuana @ 10:00
Man why the judge look fake 🤧😂😂😂
how you telling mr steele how to get to his bag da fuck💯
Great video per usual my man 👍👍👍🔥
First off the presidents son is allegedly seen on camera with a crack pipe in his mouth bro we got politicians on crack we got lawyers on we got judges on crack we got police officers on crack imma be honest with you I don't sell crack and I don't do crack and I don't promote crack but at the end of the day Mr Rivers something ain't right the system is broken.
Hey Bruce, like whack 💯 said, look at Russell Simmons he in a whole nother country evading his charge's. So yeah that illuminati shit thug Talkin bout is real so he definitely a flight risk 😂
Free Thugger 💯
Weed is not drugs 🤣🤣🤣🤣 the government sell it put taxes on it & then arrest us for selling it 🤦🏾‍♂️
They are going to have to change their names to “Young Convicts.”
You say jail is unpleasant what is life then not a reality check but life ain't sweet
Fun fact: ALL OF GEORGIA is Corrupt to the CORE.
Young Hug in there BITCHING and Moaning , man where's my cellphone
Bruce Rivers is like the real life Saul Goodman
Church ...spitting game
YouTube needs to stop unsubscribing me from channels
I heard about Bruce Rivers some people around town were saying he was the criminal lawyer, just dropping by to see if that was a fair statement.
So fucking dumb ..he deserves whatever time they give him...why tf would you stay doing hood shit when you made it out and are rich and famous ...just plain stupid he could have lived the rest of his life getting money...hooking up with the hottest women ...being able to pretty much go wherever and do whatever you want ( while abiding the law) ..but now he'll probably be doin. Like 20 plus years in prison regretting every decsicion he made
Thanks! Highly informative, Good to be equipped with knowledge. I am not criminal, nor a lawyer, but believe that nobody is immune from becoming potential client of jail institution. Law series, movies and documentaries attest to that.
Man this shit looking rough
Bruce you are that guy who makes me wanna get an autograph from a good lawyer rather than a famous rapper lol Stay blessed
Look guilty asf
It would be cool if you react to Rap Knishes by MF Doom. Everytime a rapper self snitches it reminds me of that song.
https://youtu.be/cQzLnrBWY48
He was wrong off the top  O.G Percy like jail 🤣🤣🤣
LOL, I love it!  The Blue Thugs are spending gobs of money to figure out if the street thugs are street thugs. What a country.
Can you talk about is the KKK up for a RICO???? Would really like someone to look into that
i enjoy listening to your channel! thank you.  from my point of view having lived with a tribe that has a non punishing justice system,  instead they organise a 'mediation and amends' as their justice system .. it is very respectful to the 'criminal' as well as to the 'victim' and generates a high moral standard in the community .. they have a saying that to shame an individual for antisocial behavior pushes the individual further away from the community making them a greater danger not a lesser danger. their entire society is nonviolent due to numerous intelligent principles they have lived by for millennia.. i think we all , our societies, have made a serious mistake arguing for punishment and shame as a deterrent for crime .. their is an interesting Harvard professor on a ted talk ( name??) who also points to studies and programs that have shown mediation and amends by the perpetrator to the victim and treats the perpetrator with respect rather than contempt, have been more effective as a deterrent and for giving a sense of justice and conclusion for the victim. it also gives the victim tangible benefits from the perpetrator rather than charging tax payers million of dollars for punishment. and considering the private prison system is now a favourite investment for the wealthy we seem to be going in the wrong direction.. more than one mass shooting a day in the US .. i think its clear we need to rethink the logic of our justice system!
Glamorizing criminals. blm=burn, loot & murder. Typical demoncrat law. No worries kamalah will or aoc will bail him out.
Believe Jesus is the Son of God. Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord. Read the Bible...
Thug looking like he can’t sleep in that bitch 🤦🏽‍♂️
This generation of rappers (a term I use loosely) are all LOWLIVES.  UNFORTUNATELY, law enforcement can't lock them all up.  I for one wouldn't be in cahoots with a homosexual for any reason.
Jail is unpleasant and not meant to be pleasant....kids stay at home
A Challenge From Allaah's Caliph; Al-Mahdi ________________ Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani 06-Sha'ban-1443AH 09-March-2022 AD 08:41 AM (According to the official time of Mecca Mother of Towns) ________________ In the name of Allaah the One the Overpowering. O mankind in rural and urban areas, I shall say a word -by the permission of Allaah- and His command, and neither I nor you have any choice in the matter and know that everything to do with this matter is in Allaah's hands. So know with knowledge of certainty that Allaah will Achieve His purpose, and you shall know that the bisht (Arabic: بِشت; is a traditional cloak for Arab men) is another sign. Thence, listen to, comprehend, and grasp this news from Lord of the worlds that no pledge of allegiance will be paid to a king in Saudi Arabia after the death of King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud except to Allaah's caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani. Also, know with certainty of mind that His Royal Highness King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz is dead and his son Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. O people, history is repeating itself! May Allaah Himself fights against you, how perverse are you! You have indeed reminded me of the dramatic play of the living martyr, Ali Abdullah Saleh Affash. Perhaps all the supporters of Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani would like to say: " O our Imam, we are not done yet with the trial of the scenario of the murder of Leader Ali Abdullah Saleh despite the fact that he is still alive for the sake of far-reaching wisdom of Allaah; according to a ruling of yours. Until when we forget him and the people who have greatly argued us worldwide by the death of Leader Ali Abdullah Saleh, we again find them arguing us about his murder, but what do we have to do with Leader Ali Abdullah Saleh?! And now we are running into the trial of the owner of the bisht you wore on the military uniform". Then Allaah's caliph on the world, Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, smiles, laughing at your utterance, and says: "O my beloved ones in Allaah's love, I have not done it out of my own accord, and what I know with knowledge of certainty is that there will be no king in Saudi Arabia after the death of King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud because Allaah will grant me dominion over Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and the whole world; Making me His caliph on the kingdom of the global throne of Allaah's caliph on the earth; Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, that is the promise of Allaah and He never Breaks His promises, in line with the Word of Allaah the Exalted: { قُلِ اللَّهُمَّ مَالِكَ الْمُلْكِ تُؤْتِي الْمُلْكَ مَن تَشَاءُ وَتَنزِعُ الْمُلْكَ مِمَّن تَشَاءُ وَتُعِزُّ مَن تَشَاءُ وَتُذِلُّ مَن تَشَاءُ ۖ بِيَدِكَ الْخَيْرُ ۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ ‎﴿٢٦﴾ } آل عمران {Say, "O Allah, Owner of Sovereignty, You give sovereignty to whom You will and You take sovereignty away from whom You will. You honor whom You will and You humble whom You will. In Your hand is [all] good. Indeed, You are Most Capable of everything (26)} 3:26" O my beloved ones in Allaah's love, the ball is in the court of Al Saud (the House of Saud) now, and it is better for them to yield to the fate and pre-destiny of Allaah as they have no other choice. What is the worth of the kingdom of Yemen and Saudi Arabia comparing to the worth of the dominion of the earth ,in the whole world? So let the people of Yemen and Hejaz accept Allaah's choice of His caliph on the whole world; Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani, and let them all completely enter into submission to Allaah, for this is the decisive solution for the whole world, and if you refused, know that Allaah is Almighty and All-Wise and know that Allaah will achieve His purpose. Furthermore, Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani is waiting in full dignity until the Caliphate comes at his doorstep; like it or not! Certainly, fabrications in Saudi Arabia will not benefit them at all and I understand their Security situation so I shall choose for them a prince from their family to rule them for a time, a prince who has experienced bitter injustice in order to keep the Glorified House of Allaah safe along with the safety of all of Al Saud and the Arab people of Hijaz; that is His Royal Highness Prince Mutaib Bin Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud. However, if Al Saud refused the command of Allaah's caliph Al-Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani like the people of Yemen had done before, thus Allaah let them taste the torment of the 3rd degree which they are still tasting until this very moment, (Al Saud would experience the same torment) As for King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, I offer my condolences to the government of KSA and the people of Hejaz on the death of King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud. On the other hand, if Allaah had awakened Mohammed Bin Salman from his clinical death so he received President Abdul-Fattah El-Sisi, let him speak out loud because he is neither deaf nor dumb, but far is that from happening O the impersonator of the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, you should be ashamed of these silent, deaf, and dumb videos of you before the eyes of the viewers and Abdul-Fattah El-Sisi certainly knows this. Moreover, allow me to announce the death of King Salman Bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud, and may Allaah bestows His mercy upon him, he indeed torments whomever He wills and forgives whomever he wills. Also, what I want to say is according to my knowledge, fabrications should be used for a limited time; not limitless! And I know you are elaborating fabrications on the hope that the Saudi Crown Prince wakes up from clinical death but far is that from happening... Also, I am afraid for those who elaborate fabrications and turn people away from the signs of verification from Lord of the worlds to be hit by the firm plan of Allaah (COVID) as no one feels safe from the plan of Allaah except the unjust ones In addition, if Allaah had awakened Mohammed Bin Salman, let him speak in a video to the world as we used to see him do because he is not dumb, and these deaf and dumb videos you transmit are a shame on you and whoever helped you fabricate them because lying would not lead anywhere until Mohammed Bin Salman speaks while the Saudi people hear his voice and see him on video; verily Allaah shall cause the truth to triumph through His perfect Words Peace be upon the messengers and praise be to Allaah Lord of the worlds Allaah's caliph and servant; Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani ________________ 📌(To read the statement in clear and coordinated writing kindly visit the official website of the Awaited Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammed Al-Yamani or search Google using the statement's title): "A Challenge From Allaah's Caliph; Al-Mahdi" 1 #فيروس_شنغهاي_ذو_عذاب_شديد Vdhdvv
💯 jail sucks even in Australia. Some dirty fuxkers in there who don't clean them selfs or there cell. An the influx of cooked an fried cunts in there is insane, 4 people to a 1 man cell at one point. Was stupid as hell.!!!

Bruce you a lawyer... so why you running so many ads homie?! Not enough lawyer mula coming your way already?? Haha
I don’t even care about this case, but you do such an excellent job at breaking down and explaining things  that I tuned in. (Coming from your Johnny Depp videos) keep up the vids!
Sobering up in there is crazy for anyone but imagine the comedown when you’re a star.
Bruce rivers he’s the criminal Lawyer . Is trending #46 …. The county is kind of like a dungeon the doctors were former veterinarian’s it’s hell on earth
We all know the real reason young thug is complaining he is going threw heavy drug withdrawals
first amendment has nothing to do with this case. it does however have everything to do with the fifth amendment
When a lawyer says He ain’t getting out of jail uses those Ebonics terms it’s real gunna ain’t getting out of jail damn why they ain’t hire Bruce rivers
if all these rappers stop becoming gang members n just do music they wouldn't have so many problems!!
Would’ve fired my lawyer soon as he suggested that bullspit 😒
i already like this lawyer, he's giving u the reality of thugs case, if u can't do the time, don't do the crime, gangsta!!
Jail is literally torture
Well, there’s a way to stay out of jail. Don’t break those serious laws! These guys are not committing victimless crimes. I’ll save my pity for the people, neighborhoods and children these selfish thugs are destroying with their “ lifestyle “. I feel bad for anyone looking at years in prison. But..You choose the behavior, you choose the consequences.
Young thug is extremely fucked
Bruce has got to be from the hood!
The deputy’s are the ones that don’t give a fuck about you.
Hes probrably going through opioid withdrawls and getting super uncomfortable, that shit sucks.
When Pushing P (Product) goes wrong
If you don’t self snitch it’ll make it easier for your lawyer.
That bid not gon be easy on any level. Do that stretch. Everyone deserves a Second chances! Let that Man go
Bruce rivers snitched on everything lol
Trying to live up to his nickname?  Well, people, here's a lesson in life and law that should be paid attention to especially if you are young and think you know everything.
He's going threw withdrawal bad !!!! Reason I think he's crying like a girl....
Ppl They can deni bail... Look at the UFC fighter Cain Velasquez for attempt murder. On  a child  molester ...that molested his 4 year old son son he shoot at them but hit the passenger....no bail
Please explain to these guys the reason that they haven’t seen anybody get caught with the “switch” (FULLY AUTO) Glock Device because (those people disappear) with the sentence that so long nobody ever hears from them again or knows they exist! ✅
Jail is meant to break you into snitching like all these guys are about to do 85% of individuals cooperate with the federal government just like tea I did it’s just done in such secrecy that nobody ever really finds out! (BLACK OPPS)
bro I’ve been to solitary confinement over a dozen times probably jail is not supposed to be comfortable and I’m glad it wasn’t it made me not want to go back and be around soft people that couldn’t handle doing the crime and the time Young Thug is a pole smokin Flamer 🔥 who claimed he banged Birdman for a record deal I could care less what happens to him he’s part of the problem
He not coming home never
what are you doing with Adam 22 that dude is the problem and you know it yes a lot of these young kids go on there and throw themselves under the bus but he shouldn’t be letting them do that I would not let people incriminate them self on my podcast consistently he definitely plays a role in the downfall of black and brown men in this lifestyle
Heard they got about 50 murders
Wait was that First Avenue from downtown Minneapolis? 😂😂
take his case!
Keep in mind Young Thug has a DUI lawyer on his RICO case just think about that
I love how rich people complain about the conditions in jail but literally went to jail on purpose so my advice is enjoy the jail cell that you put yourself in buddy catch you later
Pls pls more Jonny depp amber turd 💩 coverage
when you said jail is not meant to be comfortable i got the smell of the cement walls and shit ahh hell na lmao
Need to have plantation conditions as a deterrent. Prison should be self sufficient. Grow its own food and all
Their within her breast. Good one
Man where’s the amber heard video, dying to see your take on Camille Vasquez’s cross exam. Seemed like she did really good showing how much of a lunatic Amber is
When you shit where you eat eventually the roaches in a rat will come always remember that and after that you definitely going to be sick
isn't it innocent until proven guilty they've been letting him commit these so-called crimes and he's been free all this time why not give him an ankle monitor and bail that's like unconstitutional Assuming he's guilty
I was so about to hit that unsubscribe button if he said the full quote of that wiretap 🤣🤣🤣
Yeah he's done💀
Was that Epstein 👀
🐀🐀🐀🐀
Who is he
I can't wait for your reaction of Amber Heard cross examination
How does one ask to use the bathroom in court?
I miss criminal law. I wish I had a better experience with my local SAO. I probably would still be in it now. But the work load and the stress was too much for me. 😭 I come on here for my criminal law fix and take some criminal CLE’s now instead lol.
Why You Don’t Have Music Industry Clients because you not good enough 💯
Gangs have devastated our community. YT is apart of that devastation. I wish the best for his mother and children. Young gangbangers take note.
Sometimes I'll be lying in bed at night, about to drift off when suddenly, my waning consciousness hits me with a "BRUCE RIVERS HE'S THE CRIMINAL LAWYER. WHO IS HE? ...BRUCE RIVERS HE'S THE CRIMINAL LAWYER... 🎶 🎵 "
That's the lawyer fight with his last drop of blood . Lmaoo regardless of the nonsense 🤣
Devils advocate here: Every single lawyer should learn the phonetic alphabet. Honestly everybody should. I have a terrible memory and even I was able to learn it and it's super handy. I use it almost monthly. Doesn't sound like often but trust me it's worth it.
keep those thugs locked up!!!
#StopSelfSnitchin
I know people wanna beat up on rappers but the district attorney has nothing. With RICO, you can convict someone on very little evidence. One of the reasons RICO has such a high conviction rate is because most people don't go to trial, they plead out.
He got the grippy on the desk LOL
Young thug a man who wears female clothing going to prison lol
Aka lean.. damn my guy Bruce with the shits. I was like hmmm what was that. Also ‘Marijuana - no one cares about that’ lol 😆 Bruce is the man
At this point all the rappers should hire Mr. Rivers
My favorite white dude
Fani Willis is prosecuting Young Thug for lyrics but let a pedophile cop go free. She drags her feet when it comes to prosecuting cops. She gave the Rayshard Brooks case away. I think she’s goin at rappers to appease the yt supremacists for acting like she was gonna go at Trump.
This boy is cooked 🍳
Slime fried somebody Gon snitch but even if not slime got caught with switches n drugs why he have that shit at his crib if Yu gotta do all that at home n Yu famous nigga MOVE.. pure ignorance and he beentalkin on the phone 🤦🏾‍♂️
He need T.I lawyers
the worst part is you know that mf Alex (who aint P btw) is praying on thug downfall
We’re waiting for the cross examination reaction please do it we love to see your reaction
Lock him up and throw away the key. Just look at his stupid rap name
He is so fucked on those gun charges
But who is he
Jail is a good way to see how f****d up america is (not speaking on young thug's behalf)
This con-man and marketing himself to stupid ass drug dealing niggas! Disgusting...
The prison industrial complex don’t care about reformation. They only care about making money off of you being in there.
Best mornings with Dr.rivers
Starving homeless people love jail ..they tresspass on purpose to get arrested so they have food and a warm place to sleep.
I DONT FEEL SORRY 1 BIT FOR THESE DUDES.....THEY WANTED TO BE KILLERS LIKE IT WAS COOL...YOU REAP WHAT YOU SOW
Hello Bruce, watching this Johnny Depp and Amber Heard court case, looked up Rocky Pendleton and there is Amber’s secret fight club,
Jails should be used to rehabilitate people into contributing citizens. Not treated like animals. I understand its supposed to ve punishment but forfeiting your identity, dignity, and humane conditions shouldnt be the price to pay.
And he's going to react to all the self  snitching
NO BONDS FOR RICO’s youngsters!
hes gonna sit for a long ass time....sheesh
Shit we can only hope this serves as an example to stop rapping about the dirt you be getting involved in. Feds are listening, they know that money and those guns arent props.
If u had a chance to take on thug or gonna case would u yes or no can I get a answer not a heart jus asking
Listening to this as a CM at a PIP firm. Lol looking to get into Crim Defense and you’re the best bro
Thug moving around like he dope sick looks like that lean coming up out him.
you ever have the intro play while walking into court kinda like ya coming in for a WWE battle?
Rappers always acting so damn tough until they go to jail.. then they complain about the food and conditions! ITS JAIL.. some one in this case will 🐀!
Bruce….you don’t like seeing “Anybody” going to jail?
Are You Going To Review Sergio Kitchens First Appearance
5:20 makes sense 1000% but does that only matter if there’s a snitch?
Bruce you gota go help young thug
Free YSL
I know people wanna beat up on rappers but the district attorney has nothing. With RICO, you can convict someone on very little evidence. And one of the reasons RICO has such a high conviction rate is because most people don't go to trial, they plead out.
Just the names“Young Thug & Gunna” carries a maximum of 10 minimum of 5
The “machine gun” classification is the switch. The SBR classification would most likely be, an AR pistol with a stock and not a brace
He is unreal, Like what about all of the other inmates they just still suffer in those conditions and you go back to a Mansion on what house arrest on a Rico. lmao. Bro its jail you going through withdrawal so you need to get back to the Lean and xans, percs and shit, I'm sorry I was  fan until I learned he is part fof the destruction in the communities. The drugs the pill poppin ,lean drinking and violence is unreal. Thats NOT HIPHOP.
Oh shit, you’re from Minnesota?
Nigga’s recognize them shoulder movements an neck stretches 🤔 that’s them opiates applying anxiety pressure to them muscles , them horrible conditions in jail is the last thing he worried about right now , them first 2weeks of unbearable detox on a jail floor is gone be life changing
Intro would be even harder if the first two shots were slow motion
I like some of young thug music but its something I see with these music thugs is that when they get caught they  alway say they are  innocent.  Right now he's going to say he never was a thug he never did any criminal activity but if he beat the cases then he will get out and start rapping about how he beat rico and he's a thug I hope his fans see that this man claims to be a thug now let's see if he deny his gangsta title.
I seen them pooping buckets other country's prisons are a lot worse
Go to another country jail here is a lot better
His lawyer looks like Epstein
Sheesh that switch and the silencer is gone be the reason the feds come. He wasn’t suppose to get caught with that!
How you have Thug in your name but complaining about jail. 😂😂  Your honor keep him in there he is a danger to community and he black. Even worse
Fulton county jail is by far the worse jail I’ve been too. It’s awful
Serious Question.. So is there a chance Gunna get a bond soon or they’ll both sit for a while?
13:23*
13:24
I can tell this man has defended some extremely high profile clients. He knows his shit. BOSS!
Bruce..... These niggas need to stay in jail.  Im not gona be one of those guys that gona say FREE anybody knowing damn well they are evil.
So when he said poor people shouldn't have kidshe was talking about his mother.
He’s done ! So sad
FACTS...jails are not to be comfortable,its suppose to punish so you learn.
If the haters from ya own city don’t get you the law will.  Move out of ur state if u get on.
Thug needs to hire Bruce.  He's the criminal lawyer after all
Where is the AH's cross examination reaction? 🤷
Black people stop supporting these racist Rico's on music labels using lyrics against the rapper, meanwhile the parent labels never get tied to the Rico, using Rico against rkelly was racist , get him the right way, not making up a bogus Rico , watch rkelly will be 🆓 the white supremacists shooter in buffalo had help , where is the Rico for these white supremacists?
Bro this guy is a millionaire but put himself in prison 🤷🏽‍♂️ simple
" Bruce River's another racist criminal lawyer because he won't be honest these are racist Rico's " 🎶🎶
True crime is popping just need to cater to a larger audience.
I love this content man! But your Plateauing, you need to branch off make a tiktok, make a podcast, get all your social media going. This content is amazing and people love it all you need is a manager to bring you to the next faze. All of this won’t consume your time hire someone (it’d be cool if it was me).
I love your knowledge.  ima black armed security guard from Chicago. I've fought a few petty gun charges but they worked out fine ,beat em all.but I don't get the petty indictment letter u get while out on bound then steal beat the case
Love it man
U gotta stop 🛑 the self snitching 🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫
See what Thug said on the phone about them gettin soft? How about Jim Jones telling them to violate super violate him
In my opinion...  Famous or not they're ruining lives and communities
When you gamble the house usually wins. get comfortable guys
Thugga be going through them withdrawal.
This video is a joke, right? The biggest, most dramatic trial and cross examination happens with Camille Vasquez and you ignore it and post this instead?
What everyone  in the comments is thinking  but not asking   Who will be the next 69? 🤔
More like Dumb Thug.
Better call Bruce
Criminal lawyer rap intro ... wonder who he’s talking to smh
I don’t think thug going no where.
Money & Fame doesn't solve mental health he looks so frightened like a normal civilian.
Idk I've met some people that seem to love jail
Let lil Durk redo your intro
Folks are now legally smarter and know what not to do or rather, what to do if ever get caught up if they’re dumb enough to entertain a life of crime.
If I was a rapper I’d immediately go to blicky bruce
Crazy how a child molester or someone who just shot or murdered someone can catch bond but thug can’t? They’ll put someone back on the streets who touches kids but won’t let mans be on house arrest is crazy to me
Johnny witnesses today.  Not good people. The man started out I don’t remember. Nope Johnny never was hurt. Amber was never hurt. Oh cmon! they knew each other 12 years. He said I take the pictures. The lady witness was shaking. Lol something up w those 2.  they lived Free. Squatters? Criminals?  Johnny was beat. The pictures were taken. Amber said she has thousands of pictures  The table. Picture. Flour from the kitchen for baking. A camera case on the table & a CD on top of it!! unlit cigarette! so plotted. Also The witness said he was responsible for pictures. What pictures.  He’s reading from a script. Because he’s acts as if he’s Mr Clean! I was home in New York He had said this a couple of times  When Amber beat Johnny! In the background when Johnny was slamming cabinets. You clearly hear Johnny say. “ what did you do last night. See Amber cause something. The guy runs to NY. Then comes back being Johnny “therapist “ following Johnny everywhere. Johnny very kind.  In the beginning  The witness clearly said nope didn’t see marking on Amber nor Johnny  Then he changes. Reading a script. He was too clear in Johnny business. But he don’t remember what drugs he did. Oh no no no I don’t even drink. right!! What about Amber knives to a dinner. Hunting knives. what about that. Stealing from his apartment. Clearly see women with full pockets one lady holding a wine bottle. Amber holding boxes w stuff.  A woman in the elevator threw Amber keys in the elevator! she looks like the lady witness? Thank you for the video!  You’re awesome!
If you’ve been in Fulton county jail before, you know what thug talking about. Shit is disgusting, old ran down is a different type of hell at Fulton county who only people who’ve been in there or from Atlanta know bout
So he’s saying somebody is cooperating
Amber walking out of court today. Now she in Contempt of court?  Johnny taking her to court. she can’t just walk out right?
Sounds like Young Thug, is going to be Old Thug by the time he gets out.
Being a famous rapper and being the leader of a street gang Is like racing a Ferrari on a dead end street , you suddenly come too the end real fast 💨!
bruh full auto glocks should be legal
Bruce with the shits
one of your best. love it
Myron and this dude would be epic
"and he's gon react to all the self snitching" that line always has me dead 😂😂😂
*American jails are unpleasant lol
I respect the people in this case, if your ignorant enough to do shit take em down
I’ve been to county jails that were so bad people were copping triple the sentence just to get to prison so you could see daylight and eat better food.
You don't like to see anyone go to jail? Even when they're obviously guilty of a terrible crime? Thats weird.
Weird how they let white celebrities just pay up and give their passports up. 😤
Strapped up Blikky Bruce da criminal lawyer
Bruce can you do a video on the Cain Velasquez case? It’s not exactly self snitching but it was a very flagrant act, thx.
I smell at least 30 years ..
This lawyer is a piece of garbage 🗑️. You can tell he works for the state
Tie hard asf bruce
Imagine if they put him in the same jail as R.Kelly
Bruce man get them boys out man. You got all the answers you are like sway!
So they set him up for his first appearance with a judge who doesn’t have the authority to set a bond…is that even legal, sounds crazy to me. I thought the bond comes during arraignment
rappers want to live like drug dealers and drug dealers want to live like rappers.......   He was rich and making money off the music, he should have left the hood stuff in the hood...
The statement that "free speech doesn't protect someone from having their own words become evidence in a criminal proceeding" sounds completely contradictory. How is it free speech if you can be punished for saying something? I don't see how using lyrics against someone isn't a violation of the first amendment, they shouldn't be able to use lyrics as evidence.
All lawyers are pieces of garbage
His movements you can tell he’s Withdrawing that’s why he’s uncomfortable.
Why would a demon complain about being in a dungeon 🤔
"What have I told you?!" Before!" Lol You the man Bruce! Thank you for all the coverage and breakdowns, much appreciated!
So I’m well aware of the conflict you’re talking about while representing more than 1 client but I have a question for you, wouldn’t that be unethical for the attorney of the alleged victims against DeShaun Watson? All of those alleged victims are represented by the same attorney so how would you draw the line?   I completely understand where you’re coming from and what you’re stating and I feel like the answer could even be “they’re all against 1 party” but that’s not necessarily true. For instance, (this is a hypothetical) let’s say one of the alleged victims story wasn’t correlating with another one of those other alleged victims. You’d have 2 parties that are then feuding over what happened or their recollection of the event. How would this be avoided and/or is the attorney representing those 22 women doing so unethically?
BRUCE RIVERS HES THE CRIMINAL LAWYER
Thanks for what you do. I always always trust your words, opinions, and legal knowledge. I love your platform it's really a one of a kind channel.
Niggas thought buying switches off allyexpress was cool naw the feds be the ones to deliver them
Rap Name is Young Thug, already a bad start, Thug been slipping a long time now, even TI had a clip telling him to get his shit together on the podcast.  Hate to see it, but it is what it is.  He's on the grill.  Once you show up in jail clothes you're fucked, iykyk.  Just glad I didn't see Lil Baby in the indictment.  Move Smart People, don't be stupid.
They will NEVER be "careful ".. No matter how many times you advise..
wheres the video on amber getting examined by johnny's team I am so excited for that video. What the heck Bruce
I don’t know why but Im always interested in your suits, love this one
Thugger probably going through some crazy withdrawals rn
Doesn't look like he's directing things from that context. Looks like he's just implying it's uncharacteristic of them
I know y’all have had to hear Bruce Rivers Criminal Lawyer in Law 😂
Who is he?
Bruce Rivers with the daily dose of knowledge
Love from MPLS
I have a question and since you very kindly responded to my post last week, I was hoping you could answer it. I have seen a sworn statement that was filed in this case by Samantha McMillan who stated she is a stylist for Amber Heard and was with her the entire day of the James Cordon show including while she was getting hair and makeup done. She said she saw Amber with no makeup on at all, up close, and in good light, and she did not observe any marks or injuries to Amber’s face or head and that no one on the hair and makeup team used makeup to cover up any marks or injuries on her head or face. This document has the case style and number at the top and the proper notary stamp and acknowledgment at the end. I did not see anything that would warrant it being completely disregarded so I am very curious why it has not been mentioned even in a redacted form? Is it ever procedure to provide pleadings to jurors just during deliberation that are not discussed at trial? Do you have the ability to find out the status of that document or if it was even legit?
React to that old video of lil Wayne, he was being interviewed by Pete moss.
Son almost break it down how it is
So who is this guy?
That aint gonna work Thug
I hope young thug gets life. He’s done a lot of harm in the hood about time it all caught up to him
He getting paid🤑🤑🤑 a lot of money to try & get him out Noway u do the crime u pay time.
so there is no free speech even for "imagination"
Bruce rivers is super rich
Bruce breakdown the mass shooting in Ny
Going to put him under the jail
These are ga state charges not federal in ga they have magistrate judges and district court judges
So why couldn’t gunna get a bond he only have a Rico charge
I’m other words, his fish is fried! 🤦🏾‍♂️
I’m sorry, but I just don’t wanna hear any complaints about jail conditions when you have “Thug” in your name and you rap about how you’re about that life. I ain’t tryna hear it. Dudes gotta stop with this tough guy shit who are all about the streets until they get behind them bars. I feel NOTHING in the way of sympathy for Thugga. Time to be gangster homie! Sweat it out. Besides, you might as well get used to it anyway because you’re gonna be gone for many years.
That Jude has an axe to grind he should be requesting that she remove herself and have this case out of county
At least thug looks healthy and better than the first time. You can tell he got Suboxone so hs didn’t have anymore withdraws
Thug is fucked those are heavy new charges
It's amazing how much of what you say is common fucking sense.
Thank you for finally lowering the intro volume!
YSL is fighting a STATE rico case , right ? everyone keeps talkin bout the feds ??? he gotta a shot against the state !
The gun on the desk you’ve been doing this for too long 😂🤣😂🤣
Yeah when I heard about the switch AND drugs,that’s a bad combo.Even if his lawyer can prove somehow it’s not his, just being at the same scene wanted for Rico ain’t good at all. 🥴😵‍💫
For real is the judge a hologram?
Tbh I don't care what happens to him. He wants to wear dresses 👗 and lipstick 💄 while self snitching on himself like who cares. Let the DA clean the rodents off the streets so our children can play in peace. Bank them all please. I pay taxes so go
Yo Bruce i been subscribed since your first 4-5 videos and i been waiting on u to react to riodayungog- legendary, or any other song as well as go over his case. would be interesting for sure! keep droppin banger videos man🤙
Bruce go get thug out please
Drugs and guns that’s not good everything other don’t matter unless some one talking he going do some time all he can do is hold his head up and stay strong prison ain’t nice at all but it’s also what you make it !
I think they better call Saul
been waiting on this shit to come out yo…🔥🙌🏻
Who can truly afford the attorney should end the conflict quickly lol
Young Thug is a "supposed" Millionaire and He only got one lawyer? Young Thug betta stop playing with his life, do he realize they trying to bank him for a life sentence. He need to hire a dream team and stop being cheap like what is he thinking.
How the judge can't get a better camera smh
I think they’re both dope sic.
Bruce keep the blick on deck
In all seriousness why isn't jail comfortable? They're already sequestered from all of society including everyone that they love might as well make it comfortable so that they're on their best behavior and serve their time like decent human beings!
this channel is gold.. make these videos longer
Thug should have hired Bruce. 😤
Idc what the media says about Trump. We need Trump back in office or someone to expand on federal prison reform. The first step act was a start. FSA sending lots of of people home from the feds. Ik I’ll get a lot of hate for this but idc. What has Biden done ?
Stay grinding Mr Rivers   TimeIsMoneyCampaign #TIMC   You got my support tap in and SUBSCRIBE
Basically they want someone to flip and you can't be the lawyer for both. Separate to dominate. Them boys gonna be in jail for a while just like Hoodrich and Lucci
Me learning law to free whole YSL
Bro young thung was not distributing lean and gas that boy just gettin the whole team right
Thank you for this video ☺️
Even the lawyers clout chase🤦🏽‍♂️
its only a conflict of interest if more than one defendant have different interest. if both want the same thing then there is NO conflict
It just goes against my nature🤣🤣🤣🤣
The goat
He needed you on this case!
You remind me of Saul Goodman Bruce! Nonetheless, great show boss man.
✨ 🎶 whoooo he is ,& whaaat he dooo ?! 🎶 ✨🤪🤪🤪

Damn thugga thugga
Can you do the oj Simpsons case
its VERY rare for people to run away especially a rich/celebrity
how? they let Jussie Smollett sick ash out?
if T.I had to do a few years in jail for the guns he had… Thug is definitely gonna have to do some big years for that gun with the switch. This is nuts !!!
“Jails are simply unpleasant “ You should see the Nordic ones actually, they have such an impressive system there
I shot the sheriff bob marley!
I feel bad for gunna. He seems like a good guy. He's just an entertainer, he's not use to those conditions and they want him to snitch 😒.
This guy river's is cool af
wait a sec. Bruce’s hairline kinda fire tho
Bruce !! No matter how many time you tell them they won't listen... This generation CAN'T stay off of Social Media... Self Snitching
You're on her dis ain't SLATT
Just noticed the cap & banger on his desk 😮
Here for amber heard cros exam review!!
I live here in Buffalo New York we just had a massacre here is it possible that you can get a hold of the racist man Manifesto that he snitched on himself about what he did
Maan this is great heheh I love the intro song Bruce Rivers is a G
If the jail is good enough for all the inmates currently housed there awaiting trial and sentenced to county years then it’s good enough for young thug he’s not special cuz he is signed to a 7 figure contract I’m sure it’s not his first time in county jail it’s probably not even his first time in that county jail
Blicky Bruce dropping heat daily 🔥 we need a Album
Call trump tell him to let my boi out
Idk why these rappers dont hire bruce
Young Thug forgot the rule by not adding, "in minecraft' at the end of the crimin' talk.
Gunna should hire you as his lawyer!
FREE SLIME 🐍
"Who cares about Marijuana ". Well said Mr. Rivers! LEGALIZE FEDERALLY!!!
Get ready Birdman 5 STAR General  Blood Gang Money Gang  Replay them videos  Lil Wayne Blood Gang  Get them ALL
Just realized Bruce is based in my city lol Waddup Bruce !
I have a crush on this guy for some reason.
Keep up the good work! Love the content
Any updates on the Fbg duck case
Who cares about Marijuana LOL Georgia and Tennessee thats who
YOUNG THUG SHOULD BE RIGHT AT HOME IN JAIL.😏🤦🏿‍♂️
Fed charges coming. Drugs and guns bring them. I was in 7 months on state charges before getting a 3 count fed indictment because of drugs and guns charge.
So why are the feds all of a sudden going after the biggest rappers why didn't they do this 10 or 20 years ago with every other gangster rapper
I promise your intro song got stuck in my head today 😩 that’s how much I watch this channel, but also the intro is 🔥
If she doesn’t have the authority to set bond then what was the point of this entire hearing?
I mean yeah 6pu can have that argument but county jails in the US are probably the worst in all the first world countries dingus
Young Thug should have hired Bruce Rivers
FART GANG in here representing 💯 🙌 💪
Thanks Bruce!
Thanks for the updates! Want to hear what’s going on in the Melly case!
The Federal Government has a lawsuit against Ga about their jail and prison system..
So he’s supposed to get special treatment, if it’s so bad let all the inmates out. I did by work like that Thug
They should hire you bruce 🤷🏾‍♂️
Gimme your card you seem like bulldog lawyer
I only been to jail once for 12 hours. The CO’s were complete d*cks. Until this white dude came to the door. He looked like he wasn’t trying to hear what I had to say, but after a few minutes he came back let me get my phone call then shortly helped me get processed out.
A Lawyer, a Black „Stop Self Snitching „ cap and a well positioned gun.  Engaging.
Change your name to better call bruce
His lawyer know it’s a bullshit argument he’s just know his client is desperate and ignorant of the law !!!🤷🏾🤷🏾🤷🏾
Dam young thug you got millions,why are you still with the bullshit?
The Goat
Should have called you, Bruce!
This case is interesting.
Was supposed to see them both perform in June 😭😭😭
Shout out Bruce man my new favorite channel. 🙏 really out for us
Its over for him
Listen up y’all, let’s be real here we can’t say free thug or gunna if they are the cause of crime in their hood, think about the sons & daughters that have lost their lives due to some street rappers using rap money to increase crime & carry criminal organisations to the top it makes no sense I’ve been a thug fan for many years I don’t want jail for nobody, but we have to support for what’s right you live in a land you abide by the law, it doesn’t matter who are but if your black man getting money be cautious what you do with it & who you become because they will be watching your harder. Everyone wants their favourite rapper or artist to be nice but think about everyone else we all bleed the same it doesn’t make them special & if they have contributed to make this vicious cycle worse then by all means they deserve prison, it’s sad to see & YSL are not the only culprits to this, there are other black owned labels that use rap money to fund their organised crime activity I don’t like naming them,M. But hope people become smarter & self educated. Peace ✌️
Crazy ,Thugga gotta wear that
Man plead guilty before they make a example out of u.
Very insightful
You speaking facts once them wire taps dropped his ass was grass
It's hilarious to me how people complain about jail being unpleasant hahahaha. I've been locked up about a dozen times in my life and they were all "unpleasant" I have been in over crowded cells where people had to stand for hours and hours, the food is worse than school food. I had to fight just to use the goddamn phone but not once did I ever complain about the conditions. Thats weak to me and makes you look weak I knew how messed up it was gonna be that's how it goes. I don't plan on going back haven't been arrested in 10 years now and plan on staying that way. All these tough guys cry about the conditions.
Attorney…can you please explain the DIFFERENCE between STATE and FEDERAL racketeering?? Why did the state charge him, but not FEDS? I hope the feds don’t… free my boy Thugger thugger.
The First Amendment gave him the right to express and say his lyrics. It’s not like he is being charged for the lyrics, then maybe we have a constitutional infringement. I think the biggest fight in pretrial is going to try and exclude the wiretaps.
Prosecutors want that lawyer fine because I guarantee someone already is talking. Guarantee it
Interesting they didn’t seize his mansions and cars or any jewelry .. 🤔
Bruce is to Lawyers what Bill Nye is to Science. The theme song proves it.
What does he mean when he says “build build build”
Dungeon like conditions otherwise known as jail conditions
Why does Young Thug’s lawyer, Brian Steele, look exactly like Jeffrey Epstein??!?! Or am I trippin😂😂😂😂😂😂
Don’t feel bad for young thug and gunna feel bad for guys that this happens to that don’t have millions of dollars to fight the case and end up pleading out just because they can’t take a chance going to trial even if they didn’t do it
But who is heeeee????????😎😎
Free YSL RiP Keed
😂 my guy said who cares , nobody cares about marijuana
Blicky Bruce back @ it with another certified hood classic
Young thug went from living in luxury having everything he wants when he wants to being locked up in 4 walls living by the jail rules ofc they are going to seem dungeon like to him
You're very good at breaking things down. keep up the vids man!
Hey Bruce, my girlfriend has recently cut things off with me and wants to concentrate on her marriage to her husband.Can i sue?
Lolol that cheesy ass intro to these videos
i had my speakers on blast and your intro played; now my mom is wondering why i'm into rap music
I got a random question probably a dumb question but imma ask anyway are armored piercing rounds illegal?
Thank you for all the content you’re giving us 🙏🏻

Lovely E.  Bruce did you hear that they are trying to remove his lawyer?
Thugs trippin. If u non white n got millions, the feds is watching you. He out here livin like Nino brown except he’s getting wayy more than a year.
That’s a nice tie if you ask me Mr Bruce Rivers
Hey Bruce my buddy has a channel he's a defense expert witness on gangs and gang members in California has a shit ton of experience on the stand for defense attorneys in California he would love to do a short segment with you I'll give your office a call I had called you a few months ago dealing with my missing child and spoke to you on the phone .
Bruce, about the new weed charges : "Who cares ? Nobody cares about Marijuana." Me, hitting blunt : Hey, I care ! I would have smoked the shit out of that Thugger weed !
that boy sober as fuck in the bond hearing. Damn shame, but he brought it on himself.
Love the hat on your desk. And damn man you're clean as a new napkin in those suits.
Bruce please realign your background picture! its crooked.
Bra probably going thru withdrawals
Good riddance imo. Rappers like Thugger made me give up my beloved music. These dummies can keep self snitching. Bye! They’re the scourge of the urban community.
Young thugs lawyer case for bond was atrocious.
Agree. But jails should be meant to be decent. Rehabilitation is a better goal than punishment for most. So ppl don’t go to shit and come out and got to try to be decent out. It’s just make ppl see the bad to be good or see the good out. The ppl at the top of the system don’t understand how dark it can get in the streets. How could they understand the problem with prison at all.
The state filed a motion to take young thugs lawyer on the case saying he’s a state Witness
Those judges have some SHITTY cameras
Don't these dudes have years and years and sometimes decades to prepare for a year or so in jail doing all this illegal shit knowingly... I don't understand people who choose this life path and then complain about a couple months in jail
And who is he?!
I love your videos Bruce! I listen to them while I’m at work and your breakdowns are awesome! It would be cool to someday get a podcast from you and listen to something more long term and maybe be able to hear more previous or current cases of your own! Much love 💯
OMFG you changed the music Volume in the beginning  Thank you!!!!
Had the honor of having dinner with Bruce and a group of some wonderful women last night, it was such a great time and the food was great. Thank you bruce!!
He got rich and famous and lived the life of someone that is rich and famous and NOW wants to complain about how bad JAIL is. You know, when you make it out the dumbest thing you can do is STAY IN 😒 #WhenKeepingItRealGoesWrong
He spending all day in the showers dropping soap
Your honor Young Thug is not a flight risk. He is only charged with violating two statues and we wish to move forward very quickly for bond before further charges are filed. Please hurry. Pretty please.
Shoulda hired CLR BR, instead u got this clown, who's taking a chekk to disgrace everyone with the dungeon bowl-shtt. Real pro, first opportunity to speak, and all.
In Finland the prisons aren't supposed to be a punishment. The loss of freedom is. They still have human rights and deserve to be in a place that's dry, warm and safe (relatively safe obviously depending on what you're in for). It's sappy and liberal but if we want to act like a civilized society we have to go the whole way. I don't like that pedos get extra safety in prison but that's the logical extension to giving everyone a chance to rehabilitate safely.
And this is the dude that dressed up like little bo peep?

#FREETHUG
AND WHA HE DO
FREE YSL🐍
👍😊
Bruce Rivers, he's the criminal lawyer- I heard about the conditions Young Thug is in and they sound like identical circumstances to Thomas Silverstein when  he was incarcerated in Atlanta.  Silverstein v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, 559 Fed. Appx. 739 (10th Cir. 2014):, eighth amendment violation.
He needs to fire his lawyer how he doesn’t know that it could be a conflict of interest smh I know that and never did a day in law school
Bruce!!!! Thanks always for the updates  Edit: If I recall Ghislaine Maxwells lawyers tried to get her release for the same reason fand it didn’t work out to well for her
I love that you can go from breaking down law to breaking drug and gang talk. I know it goes hand in hand with your job but I enjoy your intelligence!
Bruce the most gangsta lawyer on youtube 😎
It kind of sounds humiliating for a lawyer to argue that jails have dungeon-like conditions as a reason to release a client lmao
