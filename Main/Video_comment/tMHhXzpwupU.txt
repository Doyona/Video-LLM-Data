they are not freaking astronauts! It's a remote controlled joyride, nothing more. Even the rats at the ISS are more astronauts because they participate in actual important science experiments unlike parasites with too much money
They just opened the hatch from the inside and so did this new crew https://youtu.be/cSqyRWQooJM?si=j2SWmymj4xhiGAyM&t=6327 but they were told to close it and then Jeff staged the opening and said "you didn't close the hatch" - is this a joke?

Look!!! Its a plane....!! No Its a Bird....!! No Its a Flying Cock...!!
I wish I could experience this first hand. It would be such a dream come true for me as I am sure it would be for many. I will probably never experience this, the cost would be out of my reach.
🤣🤣🤣
Garys looking bleak he didnt get to go
hope one day anyone can afford to ride this rocket too. :)
This is so fake that it's laughable. Why is there so many jump cuts of take off and landing? Why is there stuttering/skipping in 2021 4k/8k HD cameras?
Start video 1:40:00 thank you
The human being invents everything on the basis of nature notice that the shape of the buster is of a virus landing
👏👏👏👍👍👍
Congratulations Blue Origin on successful takeoff and landing of first human flight
I don't know rick it seems fake  1:03 to 1:04 enter without a hat  1:59 to 2:00 comes out with a hat  the best magic act ever seen
All we see is money flying up there.
Let’s Get Blue Origin to send Flat Earthers to Space!!!!
Birilerinin kişileri bedenen her türlü pisliği yaparak olabilecek en kötü hale sokacak kadar zamanı ve kişilere geri yaşam verebilme olayı var. Geri yaşam verdikleri yerlerde her türlü pisliği yapabilecek kadar belirli bir zamanları var. Tüm bunlar ilahi bir durum olabilir.Ancak bana bunu şahsi keyfe-keder yaptılar..Yani zamanlar arası geçiş yada ölümsüzlük tarzı bir olayları var. Başka bir yerin içerisindeki esirleriz.Ayna boyutu yada başka bir olay var.Kişilerin farklı yerlerde yerlerine geçiliyor.Ve sonrasında böyle bir kurgu hazırlanıyor. Sonrasında belirli bir tarihte kişi kendi haline bırakılıyor.
People can't afford medicine they need to live reasonably, and then there are those with money that could help that instead choose to go to space. Nice job.
No lo sé Rick...por qué no llenaron de camaras la nave para ver la tierra desde arriba
This is faaaaaaakeee bro, Nice CGI
I was overcharged on Amazon right before this happened. I was not happy for him to say the least.

Unbelievable :) Congratulations!
New Shepard?  Comeon folks!  We won't be qualified to call ourselves "civilized"  until everyone, everywhere is guaranteed their basic needs (food, shelter, healthcare & education). No distance traveled can ever take us away from the fact that 25,000 +  of our fellow human beings die of hunger every single day, while tons of food (and birth control) sits rotting in warehouses all over the world.  We should get our act together here on Earth first and foremost, and make the most of our beautiful Earth, before even thinking of expanding to other planets.  We have so much to be grateful for, and so much that needs to be straightened out!
I finally got to see this tonight. I only saw the capsule opened, I missed the launch and touchdown. I just saw that incredible rocket of yours. I had no idea that thing landed itself like that. I've never seen anything like it. It looked like something out of a SciFi movie. And it launched so smooth. Not like the big Saturn boosters, this thing seemed effortless as it lifted off.  But that touchdown. Man that touchdown. What an awesome rocket that can fly itself home.  Brilliant. I am curious about the Capsule though.  Does it blow some kind of gas or air bag or something when it touches down?  How are you dealing with absorbing the shock? I thought I saw gas release when it touched down?
Captain Kirk is 90 years old, he will soon go where every man has gone before, the grave.  How do you get to hell? Very simple: claim that you're innocent.  How do you get to heaven? Very simple: Admit that you're not Innocent, you're guilty and ask for mercy.  How to know if you're guilty or not? Simply: Compare your life to the Ten Commandments God gave you in the Bible. Everyone agrees that if people followed the ten commandments there would be no need for governments or police.  Do not lie. Do not steal. Do not commit adultery. Do not insult God by using his name as a cuss word. There are six more but let's just leave it at that.  How many lies have you told in your life?  Have you ever taken anything that didn't belong to you?  Jesus said, if you look at a women lustfully you've already committed adultery in your heart with that woman. How many times a day do you do that?  Do you use God's name as a cuss word? Would you do that with your own mother's name?  If you answer these questions honestly you know that you're guilty.  God can justly punish you and send you to hell.  Ask him for mercy. His name is Jesus.  It's as simple as this, The Ten Commandments are called the moral law. You and I broke God's laws. Jesus paid the fine. The fine is death.  Ezekiel 18:20 —  "The soul who sins shall die.  That's why Jesus had to die on the cross for our sins. This is why God is able to give us Mercy.  Option A. You die for your own sins.  Option B. Ask for mercy and accept that Jesus died for you.
William Shatner to Jeff Bezos: "What you have given me is the most profound experience... I hope I'll never recover...", in awe!
What a waste! Imagine if we used that money, time and energy in saving our planet. There is nothing more beautiful than earth. History will show this decade as a wasted opportunity by 3 amazing billionaires.
I noticed that the crew capsule's hatch opens to the inside of the vehicle. I recall that NASA's Apollo 1 had an accident that claimed the lives of 3 heroic Americans.  I guess since there are very few requirements of the Blue Horizon crew to perform work while they coast out, and back into Earth's atmosphere, no danger exists for fire, and reasons for an emergency egress. Just regular air to breathe, rather than oxygen, and very little electronic devices.
How can I watch William Shatner go in to space
not a very long flight.....nothing like john glenn !  only a few minutes ??
Bezos, stop chopping down the tree to get to the top. Start climbing. It's the fair way. I'm sure your lawyers would disagree, but you can be a rocket company, or a litigation company. Right now, you're getting roasted, deservedly.
Well,... At least he didn't paint it black.
Amazons' amazing. 38 minutes from climbing up the stairs ramp to flight. It's a perfect commercial flight timing. SpaceX here bites dust: takes many hours of waiting. Moreover the propellant produces so little smoke, if not at all, that the vehicle itself is perfectly visible almost for all the flight time, and landing with so little smoke: mainly dust. Also here, SpaceX bites dust.
YOUR ONCE AGAIN BEHIND LIKE YOU ALWAYS WERE SINCE YOU DINT STAY ABOVE KARMAN LINE LONGER THAN 2 MIN LOL  SPACEX KNOWS HOW TO REALLY GET THEM UP
From the looks of the"rocket" Bozo is clearly compensating for something.  All this help with his phallic shaped device he barely managed get it up, and only lasted ten minutes, no wonder his wife left him.
Are you suing the orbit for being so difficult to reach? I've heard that Bezos is very good at filing lawsuits when he doesn't get his way.
Why are there so many key engineers leaving your garbage company and going to spacex.
They couldn't even load into an electric SUV properly.  Camera tried to cut away because they looked so dumb.   Amazing the launch went so well.  But really, what was the big deal over the stupid Rivian electric?
Đm tưởng Kênh của ông Việt Cộng 666
Jeff::: Did you measure the outside air-temperature on the way down???  If so, please post a link to its data-table, but don't claim that you had NOT installed a thermometer outside your capsule, or that you couldn't stick your hand out of the window with a cheap thermometer to see how cold it was outside!!! . thanks. K.S.
Some cigars are unsmokable
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj1sJQW98nE&t=57s&ab_channel=TheNewYorkTimes you should take him
Go Blue Origin🇺🇸🚀🌔
WHY CANT YOU RICH PEOPLE RACE TO THE OCEAN?!?! Ugh I’m tired of not knowing what the rest of the 98% unknown is.
🙊🙉🙈
Bezos Drop the suit with SpaceX and quit your whining.  Focus on going forward or get out of the game!
Jeff Who the owner of Sue Origin
Wow that's great
don't attack other aerospace companies.
I’m impressed. As soon as I have 250K to blow, I’ll be signing up.
It rocks!
The main positive thing is Wally finally getting to go to space after a lifetime of achievements. However with the recent conduct of Blue Origin and how they’re handling the HLS situation…. we’ll I’ve lost all respect for the organisation. Yes competition is good… if it makes you strive to perform better, but if you resort to underhanded tactics to try and put down your rivals instead of pushing yourself to perform better, we’ll you’ve missed the point entirely! So disappointed in you BO.
this is the biggest waste of rocket engineering ive ever seen. but that's what a mid-life crisis and a divorce will do to a person.
BO stinks...not matter where. Where are the SLS engines you promised? While you SUE the government. You are stabbing NASA. You will fail, again.
Bezos is an impediment to human spaceflight
1:47:03 *Ooooh hahaa!*
This company is a bane to Humanity. Those working there should really be ashamed of themselves, hide in a hole and never come out. All they do is whine, litigate and hamper actual space progress. Bah!
This company is a joke. A disgrace that is trying to drag everyone else down into their mediocrity.
The rocket looks like a giant dick, just like Bezos....
Quit playing around in your cock rocket Jeff who and crying and suing NASA. Good way to never get a contract let alone you haven't built anything besides this cock rocket contraption that doesn't even go to space merely 100km orbit.  Hop off your giant wallet and build something yourself rather than crying constantly about NASA and SpaceX success
They are not astronauts. Rather rocketeers  that paid 28 million
Let’s  POLLUTE  the atmosphere with  more fumes. Just because these billionaires can
can you just guys accept that spacex win in artemis bc spacex can proof that they can do it
1:51:44 😁
Jeff who?
SpaceX is better.
Okay this seems a little fishy to me. Why didn't they have cameras in the capsule like Virgin galactic did. To show everybody that they're in space and floating around and stuff. I think they were never allowed to unbuckle and float around. I think they stayed in their seats and just looked out the window as far as I'm concerned it's BS and it's a fail. Virgin galactic-1 blue space whatever-0
I will choose virgin gallactic 😁😉
Notice how the velocity is positive, falls to zero and then goes positive again? That ain't a velocity, Blue Origin... That's a speed ;)
They need to make a Wally : WALL-E crossover. She really is a star! Never stops smiling!
maybe you should just close down it takes weeks for your company to install one engine in a rocket that's not even built by  your company Space X installs 29 Raptor engines that they built on the worlds biggest rocket that they built in 24hrs Blue Origin is a hygh joke all you have is a bunch of CGI videos of what you think you can build 🤣🤣🤣🤣
All fake. Like almost everything today.
Grate v..
It's no accident this rocket looks exactly like......      Jeff😃
Just chills, so excited for the future of Blue Origin. My 4yo is asking for a ticket already!
Fake!
JEFF WHO?
A trip built on the misery and suffering of so many current and former employees of Amazon. Note: You don't have to be a douchebag like Bezos or a horrible company like Amazon to send a guy into space...See this company - Virgin. Richard Branson is actually a decent human being and he was able to do so.
Bien
Ruined the originality of video with shitty commentary 🤐
Fake
i m your faher Josse
WERE THERE NO CAMERAS ON THE INSIDE
Chicos los problemas de las cámaras calidad y falta de más cámaras por falta de personal es por cuestiones económicas ahorita por el momento el señor Don Jeff Maldito Bezos no Tiene dinero
Had to turn off the moronic commentary.
How many stairs to climb to capsule ?
Jeffrey bezos kind of looks like Mr.Clean and howie mandel
Pay your f’ing staff properly and give them proper rights before you try get to space Bezos. You’re the richest man in the world and treat them like crap.   Elon Musk has already and will continue to beat you in space. Deal with it.   Stop this BS and start looking after the humans you represent on Earth, before trying to expand elsewhere.
Crossing the karman line is not actually space in couple years spacex is gonna have ticket to space actual space
Wait for few years and you can go to actual space in starship
Fake. Worst cgi ever made! Jeff, ask nasa for more tricks.
😳🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Blue Origin, why the HELL couldn't this be in 4K (or 8K!)?!?!?!    This quality is kinda crappy!!
Посмотрели стратосферу и домой.  😉
The Cowboy Hat. Reminds me of Slim Pickens Ridden the the bomb.
Did Rosie the Riveter build this?
What a waste of time & money. A complete meaningless trip that bring nothing good the the world.
No video of separation from the vehicle…. No interior cameras ?   Why.
Wow, are there any men involved in this mission? All the commentators and those who try to explain this are women. How do I get my son interested in science when all he sees are women in these roles?
Nice v..
"...and the Blue Organ,...I mean, Blue Origin spacecraft is aloft."
"first human flight" what a joke... just ROTFL, bezos number 6.. "right next to the hutch" even more ROTFL - first to evacuate :D, this is sooo pretentious, jeff you are way too late and no one cares about you in space, Musk took all the pride. Anyway - good job but stay more humble and less cooky. "GO JEFF"... oh my does the host really said that? :D she even barks "woof" ... oh my... this is just over the top ;) this blue vs spacex is like spacex having older, single and ugly brother that no one wants to talk to due to his bad breath ;) .. "woof woof"
https://youtube.com/channel/UCiNFWJt-n0KsDdKMqjn724w
I didn't get to see all of this video... Was there a Happy Ending?
Fly to space in a giant dildo...
What an incredible piece of shit 😅 not a single camera on board yeah
Wow what an amazing accomplishment to all those new astronauts!
What is the price of the ticket? I want to send my mother-in-law very far...
That's awesome love you team blue origin🌐🌐 🚀🚀😃😃👍👍
so anyone who goes up, do they all need to go through the same training as astronauts?
Felicidades, el segundo gran paso para la humanidad...
This whole stream is cringe. 😄 What waste of time.
Anjel Gutierrez 4 Senate in Colorado 2022.
This is a painfully obvious ridiculous CGI event presented to us as a real functioning rocket being launched to space... SPACE IS FAKE and no one has or ever will go there. Number 1: It's doesn't exists as a place to go. Number 2: We couldn't get ourselves there by use of rockets if it was real, hence the CGI presentation...  Something that I refuse to believe is possible is: The New Shepard "rocket" gets to a max speed of about 2230mph at which point it is at approximately 28.4miles in altitude and then the "rocket" performs MECO (Main-Engine Cut Off). As New Shepard is not a multistage "rocket", this would imply that the vehicle is no longer using any propulsion to finish it's journey to "space", which is a hefty 38 additional miles from the point of MECO happening... Am I supposed to believe or think it's possible for a payload of that mass to travel almost 40 miles without the use of thrust?!?!?!?1   NONSENSE! Such a joke that people believe this fantasy-land story...  Wake Up. Space is Fake.
I am disgusted
He d rather pay taxes.
Don't believe them
Fake!!!
so fake! learn to hollywood movies...
Good job Jeff good job Marcos good job Wally good job Oliver you did amazing
1:40:03 augmented reality layer...its moving all over the place!
Jeff Bezos's dream had became reality after coming back safely
Why they don't share the view of Earth from capsule? As Richard Brandon showed from their vehicle.
Watching bored billionaires having fun spending their mostly untaxed fortune is really great! I hope we'll see some yacht maiden cruises and mansion constructions soon!
that human capsule landing looked hard
To be precise... actual flight starts at https://youtu.be/tMHhXzpwupU?t=6098  💖💖 1:41:38
Actually it's not first human flight 🙃
2021 and blue orgin organised prof, camera crew and helicopter ,drones, newest technic and no CAMERA INSIDE ??? That is weird ?
This camera  zoom is amazing which brand camera is this 🙉
👎 "First Human Flight", I know what they intend this to mean, but that title is a slap in the face of all aeronautics and astronautics 👎
This lady, obnoxious much?  🤦‍♀️ How did Fox News get their anchor on this?
Did you see anyone actually get in the damn thing? Or out? I didn't. No  internal cameras? BS nobody was in the flying dildo...
So they can film a man on the moon in 1969 but they can't put a webcam in this? Maybe bezos isn't a prime member so couldn't one get one in time
ummm liberals are NOT!!! humans there 👉🏼💩👍🏼
But not one camera from inside out in space
I suppose most of cabling and gadgets in the capsule are Amazon Basics , right? lol
Did he really just ask him to open the trunks for him I would have been like no open it yourself are you stupid ⁉️
That's not space imho and they did absolutely nothing except sit in a chair and go along for the ride, whatever ....
The only reason I like BO is because they use mph and ft
Poor woman who feel ☹️  (min 2:03)
Ah yes, that shape. Natural Aero Dynamics.
To all the losers and haters, have a nice day!
CGI 🤭🤭🤭🤭😂🇺🇸
FAKE CGI haha. Where’s the camera after a sole minutes
To all the people with the jokes  about this-it sucks to be poor, doesn't it? :D
Congratulation  Jeff, Mark, Wally & Oliver🌍♥️🦋👏📚✌👍💯🙂
Where are you Jules Bergman?  We need you now more than ever!
To much money for rockets, but not enough for good cameras...
CGI dildo? come on...
What a pointless exercise.
Gee, I wonder if my penis joke will stand out amogst thousands of other ones!
They spent how long in 'space'? 90 seconds or so? Over 2 hours of bozos wanking and telling everyone how he rips off the IRS and his employees. What a moron. Oh and if you stand outside, jump as high as you can. You are technically 'in space'
The landing of the booster was the coolest part . It resembled an old scifi movie . Looks like  it touched down softer than the capsule .
All that money spent, and the ship looks like it was designed by Mel Brooks or Woody Allen - it looks like a giant rocket powered dildo.
Vergin galactic is better than this 🙄🙄
@1;41:51 ANYONE CARE TO EXPLAIN HOW THIS SHOT WAS CAPTURE.  Seemed like a stationary craft filmed it looking down and then panning all the way up as the Rocket passed it. ANYONE?
Too much money for 10 minutes of flight. What is the use of it. You cannot even finish eating your meal.
1:48:44 when i had too much taco bell
I think i'm on the wrong site ... this isn't the 'rocket ship' i was expecting
Call me a buzz kill or whatever not trying to be one. Considering we had the first American go to space 60 years ago is it REALLY that big of deal? Come on.
I'd hog the best window. Sorry.

What a crap propaganda is that? Really? Can anyone believe that bullshit? Great actors yeahhhhhhj And all the cowboys hats at the landing? The american dream yuhuuuu Jajaja
@47:45 into the video…….  Spend billions of dollars on a rocket and ride into space, but cut costs by not getting the electric tailgate option on the Rivian?
1:06:29 "don't keep pulling on it" Jokes... go...
With what we can do with the ISS and satellites, just crossing the Karman line is required to be officially in space. I think at a full orbit should be at minimum in space
Following their corporate motto to a tee...
Where is space?🤣Fakeasfuck
First human flight? Mr. Natural is just going to have to tell you to fuck right off. And do it today.
Good flight for fun =)
Fantastic!
Man it sure would suck if Jeff Bezos got thrown out the cockpit mid-flight into space, hahaha yeah
Nice one Bozo
1:41:53 CGI GRAPHICS WHAT A SCAM!!
what a scam!
lets be honest, the rocket looks like a dildo.
I don't see the point
international same day delivery is now available.
Congratulations😀👏  BlueOrigin Mr. Jeff Bezos Team New Shepard 💙 Just wondering if you could double stack the rocket tank/booster as a separate two to take the cupsule higher in to outer space🚀😎
"Newest minted astronauts", just like grandma is a "newly minted sailor" when she takes a Caribbean cruise.
I love how the RSS FIRST STEP is covered in NO STEP stickers
First human flight? You mean 'first civilian flight'?
ahh yes yet another attraction for the elites of the world to par take in....no normal peasant will even come close to this thing
"Sir something came on our radar" "What is it?" "It looks like...."
You did not reach the orbit.
Ca commence à 1:41:30
100% sure the Rocket was modelled after Jeff's phallus!
They just did 5% of what Iuri Gagarin did in the 60's, but without any reasonable motivation. Try again next century.
Catastrophic events happening worldwide. Haggai chapter 2 verses 6-9 Luke chapter 21. The TRUTH of the scriptures are being fulfilled right before our eyes. " All who call on the name of the LORD will be saved " JESUS CHRIST is the LORD. " There is no other name under heaven by which mankind can be saved " " Call unto me and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things you know not of " Start calling on JESUS CHRIST HE stands ready to save you.
Start from 1:37:00. You are welcome!
They dood it
Is Space Flight suppose to feel this corporate and fake?
When will we see what's inside the capsule?
"If Amazon paid its workers fairly and did not fight unionization, workers would not be funding the expensive hobbies of billionaires. They would be taking care of their families and living dignified and fulfilling lives" - Rep Pramila. It's absurd that billionaires get to shove their obscenities in our face!
Bezos would like to thank all his employees for making this happen by pissing in bottles, working for low pay, and paying higher tax rates then him.
Congrats, now stop treating Amazon employees like slaves and pay them a living wage you bloated sack of shit.
This is the most unproductive and waste of money ever. Money, time, and brainpower put to the worst test. Just for the fun for a bald-headed guy with lots of money. Money could be used to feed all the homeless humans in US for a year maybe two. America, wake up and stop giving this bald-heard money and boycott Amazon. Amazon workers stand up and stop helping the bald-headed guy. Fight for your dignity with the bald-headed guy mocking the workers for giving the chance of spending millions or billions for 10 mins of fun. Next, he gave 200 million away just to make him feel not so bad, and still you workers are still making below poverty wages. Remember he thanked you for the ride and you puy him there. That's an insult. Shame on all his Amazon customers that shopped online instead of local.

Mai visto uno scherzo piu mal riuscito di questo, compreso il momento in cui il razzo atterra (la telecamera ha cambiato scena 4 volte in 5 secondi)... inoltre il decollo sembrava tratto dal miglior "flight simulator"... anziane persone che vengono sollecitate in partenza da un'accellerazione cosi (senza preparazione"... chi volava sul concorde vista l'altitudine raggiunta era sottoposto ad esposizione maggiore delle radiazioni presenti nella alta atmosfera, figuriamoci ad un'altitudine 5 volte maggiore.... un ottimo bluff caro BEZOS... Ma del resto molti credono agli ASINI CHE VOLANO
Very misleading headline.
https://youtu.be/wNvwHLPpVbs
Que hago aquí?
Where are the f. face masks - his company is making propaganda for?! This very bad pandemic (with no deaths) will kill em all......
https://youtu.be/BvAwqx3Xl2w
this is a lie people. wake up. why can't we ever have cameras position on the proper angles. in the rocket, in the cabin, any picture taken by the crew. nope we get CGI, and far camera angles. what nonsense.
It is cool! And our future is International  conference  -  Creative  society 24/07/2021. Global Crisis. This already affects everyone.
The designer of this rocket must have a weenie toy in front of him / her, then comes the inspiration.
you could spend 1 weekend in Burj Khalifa tallest hotel same cash...and 4 days in planes there & back
Who knows how technically the rocket managed to vertically land on its return?
bezos is dr evil
The cowboy hat is where I lost interest. Petty, I know.
But where is the video from the capsule - too many talking heads on this channel.
I love it how they call them astronauts 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Simple ..clean snd it work's. Make's space X look a bit old school.
Как тебе такое, Илон Маск?
No movie from the cabin 😕
How the heck did they not have loads of high-definition cameras capturing earth and space and what the astronauts saw? It's madness to me.
They didn't even go to Space. They went to the Atmosphere. And everyone is acting like it's a big accomplishment. UNTIL WE COLONIZE MARS, THIS IS JUST ANOTHER PLANE IN THE SKY.
I'd like to ride it if I could.
Such a huge amnt of ressources spent just for Bezos to get his adrenaline shot, all this talked abt as if it was a huge leap in human history It's all so dumb, Honestly if you still have sympathy for billionaires you're a huge dumbass
Looks like a lighthouse. I want to see Musk ORBIT and blow away these human suitcases.
I'm honestly so disappointed, thought they would at least enter an orbit... Nop, just going up and then dropping down WAOW
https://youtu.be/SUABEa7k4aw
FAKE...can't you see the CGI?!
que mierda de transmision
Nice video
First Human flight my 🍑 they been putting peeps into space since 1968 or 69
The fact that this channel doesn't even try to police hate comments wishing Lex Luthor dead (I am certain of this, I wrote some of them) is a pretty clear indicator that this vanity trip wasn't a case of tonedeafness. Bezos knows exactly what he is doing which is rubbing it in, since he is very likely a real sociopath.
Earth is flat as you can see lol you can also tell they hit the firmament, there is no “space” as we know it
What are you guys doing, upload a 5min highlights real of the launch and 2.5 mins shorts of other high points. Your missing out on hundreds of thousands of subscribers!! People just dont watch this
Jesus Christus is coming soon guys open your eyes he's loving you so much change u mind and oben u heart he will safe u soul for more read the Bible and you will see its the truth in there!
#BlueOrigin Why not leave the capsule attached when landing?
PAY YOUR TAXES BEZOS !
hi
Очень дорогой аттракцион батут...у барона Мюнхгаузена лучше получалось...
The whole production is one big stroke fest. & I'm not talking about the launch. The commentator is super annoying & flowing with superlatives in glory of Bezos. It feels so gross.  Technically the launch is very impressive, no matter what people say about it.
Congratulations for a well performed flight :-)
So apparently if you are a $Billionnaire, global warming is a non-issue when you feel the need to project your massive insecurity to literally create a massive phallus-see 🤮🤥🤡😷
And during our summer of climate extremes highlighting the global warming crisis, how much CO2 are these guys producing for a 10 minute joy ride into space?
That was not a space flight!that was a space joke from a billionaire who doesn't   know what to do with his money!
It's not a historic moment, Jeff Bezos (Dr. Evil) is now a meme and living in the shadow of Elon Musk. Pay your workers a living wage and deal with your ego.
Elon - All that for 3 minutes of zero g? 🤔🧐🤦‍♂️🤣

What about some footage from inside so we get their perspective.

Surely it's not the 1st human ?
WOW!  Not even a speech to mark the occasion and send out a positive message?  What a douche.
I can't believe how there are people who believe this whole show .. the interstellar movie is more real than this
1:52:35 why is he not moving?
It's good, when someone flies on a plane for the first time and observes everything through the window, this group, however, going into space for the first time, preferred to throw a ball and completely disregard the window, what a thing not?

Why they call it as first human flight when they return back in capsule
Imagine if it blew up 🤣🤣🤣

No cabin video feed??? 🤔
no one cares.
That blonde chick annoying as shit
Please tell me people don't believe this is real
So many suffer and they prance around in low orbit pretending to be cool.
i'm pretty sure jeff bezos brought a kid and an old lady because he knew somebody would try to crash it but now it would have looked bad...fucker
Bullshitssszz!!! It is boring and useless...only for ego.. fake Ego
Congratulations Blue Origin on your successful flight. I'm so happy for Wally funk to finally get to experience Space, even if only for a short time. You did it Jeff.
Todavía hay gente que se cree esta p.m.

The worst part of astronaut experience was when they had to climb up the stairs instead of Elevator, it’s 2021 Blue Origin where everything is autonomous these days and yet they still go with old fashioned way.  I feel bad for poor lady Ms. Wally Funk age 82, but still bravo for her enormous strength and enthusiasm.
Hmm booooooooring
真是歷史偉大的一刻，貝佐斯好樣的！
Are like 100% positive you don't want Prime? Like come on just get it you moron.
I gotta give bezos credit for getting on the FIRST manned flight of that rocket.
Second comes right after first
We will fail every time; it is in our nature to SIN. It is only through the  BLOOD of JESUS CHRIST, that we can acquire complete forgiveness. We can all attain this by just accepting Jesus as our Savior, and accepting that He shed His BLOOD to atone for the sins of all who repent.   1. If you need help with ANYTHING in your life, all you need to do is ask God in JESUS name. I am not trying to preach here, but this REALLY works!   2. Just ask JESUS to FORGIVENESS of your sins!  And then say this BELOW.  3.  Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, The power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.  4. I am serious, this really works! Just say the LORDS PRAY Above, anytime you need HELP. It is that simple..........
Would have been a better experience to watch if we didn't have to be distracted by the yapping commentator.
1:48:43 I actually thought that sound was a fart for a moment
JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN!! 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 (KJV)  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
Ten minutes? It's sort of like an amusement park ride for millionaires. (Wait for the new mile high club to happen.)
I just put in my application to be adopted by Wally Funk as her grandson. I'm 47
Next rocket will be "SALVAGE 1" can somebody in Holywood make a remake of that because it is already coming true just like Star Trek.
With all his money, he couldn't afford better cameras for his flight? Disappointing.

Matthew 5:17-20 King James Version (KJV)   17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven : but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.  Psalm 89:{34}! <---- ! I will not violate my covenant     or alter what my lips have uttered.  Malachi 3 6 “For I the Lord do not change; therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed. 7 From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them.    Matthew 4:10 New International Version (NIV) 10 Jesus said to him, “Away from me, Satan! For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.   The Wise and Foolish Builders 24 “Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.  25 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.  26 But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.  27 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash.” 28 When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,  29 because he taught as one who had authority, and not as their teachers of the law.    The Narrow and Wide Gates  13 “Enter through the narrow gate.  For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.  14 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it.   Exodus 23:13 13 “Now concerning everything which I have said to you, be on your guard; and do not mention the name of other gods, nor let them be heard from your mouth.

like to ask a small favor of those being negative or positive to understand that LGBT people are still being beaten to death for being LGBT in the united states...its still 40 years ago for some of us...plez just try to be compassionate to what life is currently like for our LGBT brothers and sisters... *hugs not hate*
Thank you  Wonderful endeavor! Congratulations!
The woman in mission control 😍
Wow the possitive energy from Wally Funk.  Lesson to be learned that we must never give up on our dreams.  Well done Wally Funk!.  As for Jeff well done!  Watched your live launch on France 24 News.  Lets see if Ellion Musk is going to do better.  Perhaps he will fly to the moon and back!🤣😉
Space has now been penetrated by the space pecker!

Hi  i am Abdul Rahman from Oman i hope to join you in the next trip i love that it seems like a joke but i am sure it could happen  if Allah wish that my contact no 0096899460256 don’t forget me pls many thanks
Fun fact: Humans are the only animals that blush.
why do they have the tracking cams on auto-focus? or why do they go blurry every now and again? not like the rocket is coming closer.
Yeah I'm also taking the plane so I'm an "aeronaut"
Congrats!
then they advertise it as the first human flight, what a joke, there are real astronauts living in space FFS
I literally do not get the point?  is this thing going to rendezvous or is it just a joy ride excursion?  seems a waste, jump on the back of my Hayabusa if you want somo good adrenaline, not near as riskey..

Evil sick Communists: "It's "wraysiss" to require people of color to obtain IDs to vote, even though most people of color SUPPORT requiring voter ID!"  Also Communists: "It's not "wraysiss" at all to require people of color to get experimental vaccines and obtain COVID passports that they will be required to carry at all times!"  Also, Biden can send teams door-to-door to make sure people of color got their death vaccine, but he can't send teams door-to-door to help them get voter IDs????🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,,,.,.,..,
BLM just pledged support for the Communist Cuban government that is shooting unarmed protesters in the street, which makes it 100% clear what they actually are: a Communist terrorist organization.  It's no different than when the "founder" of BLM, Patrisse Cullors, spent tens of millions of dollars in BLM donations on mansions for herself rather than putting that money into black communities.  It's all just a Communist conquest.  They say they're against "police brutality," but then support police brutality against innocent protesters in Cuba.  COMMUNIST HYPOCRISY.,,,., , ,
What happens to the right square images between 1:48:50 and 1:48:51...?
Didn't Elon Musk and Virgin do it 1st?
Why are they making it so unnecessary complicated? Just put wings on that rocket and it will be much easier to land this thing. Besides Felix Baumgartner already did that years ago in much more epic manner. Nothing special about this here honestly.
Very happy for the man that tortures his workers and destroys independent enterprise around the globe
That rocket looks like a ....

After watching this I feel like, VIRGIN GALACTIC IS MORE BETTER THAN THIS.
Amazing great job and even perfect camera work which is more proof that NASA is a bs company robbing the American taxpayers. This is the first time blue origin has done this and they could not have executed it any better. The mission a great success but also the full coverage live no cutting to pointless views and cameras cutting off when landing. Boycott NASA excellent work from blue origin
Tell me you're a rich spoiled kid without telling me you're one
10 minutes flights to space from lift off to touchdown.. Pathetic to call them astronauts #virgin too

I don't get all the celebration. Bozo Bezos and his penis mobile only flew really high for a few minutes but was not in orbit. Feels like a bad marketing stunt. Try to circle the earth a few times. Can they do that?
I can't believe they put ads on this video. You can't even scroll to the launch part without being interrupted by ads.
It' amazing how many resources (material and human) where wasted for something that useless
damn i was hoping it would blow up

all that for 10 minutes fun...
What's the total time spent in space?
Turn to Christ, Jesus loves you, trust in him bring your worries to Jesus , He will turn your situation around for your good with no strings attached because he loves you. So accept Jesus because he is the only way through the father and the  only way to be able to go to heaven. Jesus died so that we may have life and be saved from going to hell. Repent Jesus is coming soon.
🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥l like it but l don't now
The video needs a better name, The first human flight of Blue Origin.
Miles and Feet? That's why no one can take this effort seriously!
Branson an bezos just want to give the rich a means of fast travel. Musk I have respect for. Did u see him go up on his dragon? No because he is about pushing man's exploration of space. They say the everyday person can go into space. We plan to have it as low as 30k a seat. Ya thats a price the everyday person can afford alright. The rich man's space airline.
Felicitaciones a Wally Funk por finalmente levantarse y regresar a salvo 60 años después del Mercury 13
Jeffreeey,  Jeffrey  bezooooooosssss!!!!
This should not be a thing.
Wally's flight justifiably honors the Lovelace-13, but not for the superficial and bogus reasons in current media coverage. https://www.thespacereview.com/article/4215/1 She was not picked as a Mercury astronaut for the valid reason of lack of high-performance high-hazard flight testing that killed or emotionally crippled vast numbers of pilots in that field. Those who remained showed they had the mental steel to handle the terrors of spaceflight threats. She hadn't been tested to demonstrate that skill.

Hey when Elon finally does that trip around the moon , it would be fantastic to do a hi-res VR recording of it. That would probably kill Virgin and BlueO ticket sales....To look back at earth in decent VR, lasting hours, from true outer space would indeed be a deeply moving experience. Vastly superior to being only 100km up ! Pleeeeease tell Elon to set up VR recording systems!

Congratulations Jeff Bezos...the crazy boy of Planet Earth. You have worked hard, made a lot of money, and now invested in breakthroughs for the space adventures. But you did not stop there...rather took the first flight yourself with your brother. Thats a lesson for many, but difficult to emulate. #blueorigin #Jeffbezos
Shut up lady and let us just watch. When can see
8:20 the rivian r1s 😮
我们由文天祥这一杰作的发挥，对于孟子“我善养吾浩然之气”的“我”与“吾”两个字的意义也就更加清楚了。  那么我们要问:“文先生！既然你有浩然之气，应该不会被元朝敌人俘虏坐牢才对呀!”  其实他被关起来、被杀害，也正是浩然之气的发挥。他的《正气歌》接着列举许多历史上的忠臣烈士，这也就是孟子所说的“以直养而无害”，义所当为，赴汤蹈火在所不惜，该如何便如何，生死早就置之度外。所以文天祥的《正气歌》最后便说:“顾此耿耿在，仰视浮云白。悠悠我心悲，苍天曷有极。哲人日已远，典刑在夙昔。风檐展书读，古道照颜色。”这说明“是气所磅礴，凜烈万古存”，其中隐含的最高道理使人深思，同时也描绘出一个智者踽踽独行的心境，何其苍凉悲壮、崇高伟大！  重点还是上面的几句话，尤其是“于人曰浩然，沛乎塞苍冥”，大家要注意的是：我们每一个人只要活着，就有这股浩然正气，这是生命本有的，只要肯下工夫，每个人都能够由博地凡夫，修养到天人合一的境界。  这是文天样在苦难中体验出来的真理，他这牢狱中的三年太不简单了，他只要肯点头，元朝一定请他当宰相。他在宋朝的残破局面中，面临亡国时，到处奔走，只是个无权无势、又无富贵可享的虚位宰相。他不向元人点头服从，就只有坐在牢里，面对着牛粪马尿、苍蝇蚊虫，但他就是硬不点头。忽必烈最后一次和他谈话时，他谢谢忽必烈对他人品才华的赏识，引为知己。但是他仍不肯点头，要求忽必烈成全他。到这个时候，忽必烈虽然爱惜他，却也气极了，答应他第二天行刑。这时他才站起来，作揖拜谢忽必烈的成全。我们看，这是何等的修养！这是何等的气象！这就是“沛乎塞苍冥”的浩然之气。  文天祥在刚被俘的途中，曾经服毒、投水，以图自杀，都没有成功。后来遇到一位异人，传给他大光明法，他当下顿悟，已了生死，所以三年坐牢，蚊叮虫咬，但他在那里打坐，一切不在乎。所以他说只要持心正气，一切的苦难都会过去，传染病都不会上身了，当然做元朝的宰相更算不了什么。有些学佛学道的朋友常常问念什么经、什么咒可以消灾免难、驱邪避鬼，我说最好是念文天祥的《正气歌》。可惜大家听了都不大相信，我也无可奈何！至于后世道家的咒语，便有一个根本的咒语《金光咒》，起首就是“天地玄宗，万气本根”，也可以说是从《正气歌》中套出来的。——《孟子与公孙丑》

Hey Jeff.... How about making something really usefully to mankind like the "On Demand Hydrogen Auto Engine that separates the H from the H2O as it's needed to fire the cylinders...  Odd.... It's been done before but it seems to not be worth the price to replicate for some odd reason....   I guess Jeff can't make big bucks when cars run on water even though the people of Earth and the Earth itself would benefit from the "Water as fuel engine." Yet.... Where's the profit in that?" Right Jeff...  Yup, Jeff is a real genius.

This opens space travel to all...  Well....  To all with the ability to pay the price of the ticket, that is....   What about the rest of us????  Hang in there the rest of us....

So the rich elites can go in and out of our atmosphere and do no damage to our planet ? , yet they shove climate change down our throats,All while theses wealthiest people on this planet fulfil a dream regardless of the Damage they are doing to the planet 🌍 and all people on it, its like letting children in a lollie shop to buy whatever they want while rotting their teeth the only difference is that affects that child’s choice where what the rich elites are doing is affecting others on this planet but blaming us all for their actions
I'd love a video game where the whole arc is you infiltrating his huge desert land holding there and blow that thing up just after he launches. it would be an epic game. full of intrigue

Bring me a better way of life i will join you. but remember i bring you the truth.  One Question, Where are you going ?. How you will say that you dont recekt this message. Thats not the first time, Allah warn you many times, how many chances you will get ? Life is Like that: Imagine Thanos snap with his finger. You can die today, tomorrow who knwos when it will be? Allah knows. so for wath you wait you watch a Film like Avengers Endgame wath take 3 hours for an example, so why you cant make 1 hour research,  to get real information about islam ?.   Allah will ask you, why you have  dont take this time, Allah give you so much time in This world  so many chances, But you prefer this world wath is nothing, to the hereafter and all the time and work that you invest in this world will be for nothing. Its Your choice and no one is forced, but know this Life is a test and everything have his consequences. If you have an school exam for an example you also  pre pare for  it, so why you dont pre pare for your Death ? Wath are you fear ? Every one has Questions  to which he does not know the answer or maybe does not want to know the answer, but  Allah give you the answers and  the guide for life whether you accept it is up to you.   Maybe you think you know about Islam, from things that you heard or saw, but let me Tell you, if you want to learn about Islam you need to learn from Proven Books and Proven Scholars, other wise you can own wrong knowledge.  May Allah guide you Inshallah ( Allah says come to me and i will run to you) i hope you understand.   Quran 17:15 - Whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] his soul. And whoever errs only errs against it. And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And never would We punish until We sent a messenger.   More Information, Videos, Links  about Islam on my Channel,(Playlists)  If you want to learn wath Islam and to be a Muslim means , watch the 1 Video that i linked up (woman came to learn about Islam) it only takes 15 min. Maybe you like it so wath cloud stop you, think about it
It’s hard to keep comments respectful while watching this, it’s really difficult. In the history of the world there has never been a more hideous display of hubris.
That is one phallic rocket ship 🍆
Wow. .
I love Wally Funk's energy.
its funny watching the most advanced tech and engineering companies on earth spend billions to pretend to get to space while never actually leaving earths atmosphere almost like masa pretending to got to the moon
Min 1:28:47 I don't  need to go to space to have the everyday feeling, which is really a fact, that we are in a huge spaceship trough space, travelling in the universe, to nowhere ....nonsense :(

Wait, what about the petition I signed??
lets hope they're better at flying rockets and engineering and those kinds of little things that make them go to space and back than they are at  commentating about it and the actual production of their lil webcast......?? might want to  think about hiring someone from ....cnn or nbc or any newsroom really, to help them with this part of their venture. think they can afford it. and is anyone else thinking, what i'm thinking, about the cardboard cut out thats trying to be the color commentator...??  she literally has to yell his name for him to even look at her, lol!!!  the dude has the personality of  a #2 pencil
No wonder Blue Origin is so far behind SpaceX. They are using mph and ft to measure speed and distance. If they were using metric, they wouldn't be wasting so much time converting between units. At least use miles for distance so it can relate to the miles per hour speed. Now much feet per hour is miles per hour?
Timestamp where it begins?
Wow 11million for something like  a disney ride its cool in ghe moment but 2 weeks from now eeeeh kuda used ot for somethinf better
Hello, can you help me, I am a tourist from Ukraine, I want to play Australian online poki, you can write a couple of brands, please.
I see this rocket did its first successful test in April 2015. It took them 6 whole years just to make it suitable for humans to be on board for a few minutes of space flight. What they hell were they doing this whole time? If they improved the rocket to send them on an orbit around the world, I would understand the length of time. But there is no major improvement other than holding humans on board.

Your Blue Room playing at the beggining... <3
Whoever thought the guy selling books on the internet would someday build a rocket and fly to space. Did not see that coming.
why this asshole narrator is so excited  bezos: i will pay u in millions
The video was underwhelming. No onboard video, hardly any video from the vehicle itself, no video of the view etc
Plot Twist: Blue origin story is Weiland Yutani origin story.
Hello everyone I am the most underrated YouTuber of all time.
Who?
I had a tenant who quit his job at an Amazon distribution center claim stuff was falling on his head. Then he bounced a check. Maybe Jeff can leave him in space with all his stuff on the next flight🚀

Your tax money at work folks
Good😍🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Smells fishy as usual.
*1:42:14** literally everyone on reddit: oh hey this looks like a d*ck*
I like that there's no choosing to hug Wally Funk or not. She just grabs you & pulls you in for the hug, haha! What a woman <3
Good way to avoid paying taxes.
Blue origin? Dislike. SpaceX all the way.
КАК ТЕБЕ ТАКОЕ БАТУТОВ??😁👍👍
Going to space using imperial units feels weird. It does have a bad precedent mixing units though.
Yeah. Ill be impressed when either Bezos or Branson can do some orbits!
1:28:30 Are you crazy? Remove this fast, people need to think that earth is not flat.
I feel like flat earthers will finally shut up now since seeing the earth from space is going to be like getting airplane ticket now
While literally the whole Earth is on fire, these billionaires spend billions going to space ( releasing emissions) while not paying their fair share of taxes , doing much less for the environment , and came back from 3 minutes of weightlessness and say "beautiful earth" . Hypocrisy at it's best.

they fell at 16mph?
no haha  (1:42:50) it doesnt just produce steam as a combustion waste haha (1:42:50) theres a lot of other chemicals in the trail but this industry is worth it
Welcome to the first Black Card Fast Pass Ride. If you have piles of money and no desire what so ever to do anything important with it..... come on down!
It's an amazing achievement, but why did Blue Origin have to start a new space age using Steam-age units that no-one understands outside of the US, rather than proper units? Does Blue Origin's rocket math actually use the same unscientific measurements? Why is 100km harder to understand than 348,000 ft?
Tip for jeff: buy better cams dudeee!!! I know you have money !
"Listen to the roar of the engine" " actually, dont because i refuse to be quiet"
Virtual hugs to everyone who is reading this comment 🥰❤️.
The rich going to space while the world burns... Reality is more unjust than fiction could be clearly.
Poor coverage… why are we cutting away from the astronaughts to seeing two people, we do t know taking up screen space??
I know he said i paid for this but, i want my money back.
Wally Funk was used as a PR stunt to mask away from the fact that an 18 year old snob got to go to space because his daddy paid for him to go... going forward, space exploration is now only for the super rich.   The only thing that will keep common people (scientists) in space is programs like NASA and the contracts they'll provide to companies like SpaceX.
Ракета похожа на член и мне это напоминает кадры из фильма про Остина Пауерса  - на ракету доктора Зло.
Bezos was so insecure about people seeing him crying or looking scared he forbade the launch and media team from showing video inside the capsule. Unlike how SpaceX or Virgin did it.   Screw Bezos. Insecure and doesn't pay taxes.
Jeff bozos sucks

Jeff who?
Jeff is basically the “when billionaires are bored” joke
THIS IS INSANE
Why did NASA give up? Because it couldn't get past the Van Allen Radiation Belt! Talk of going to Mars was just a distraction as Musk rolls out thousands of Sky Net microsatellites with camera's and laser like energy focus ability.
Oh shit, they're deleting Bezos-critical comments!
What money$$$ can buy huh...
How about building lots of sustainable homes for the homeless? How come the elite don't have to social distance?
Music u2?? Name??
72 Million????? Not worth it
Please help chennel me yes buddy
Booster touch down!  Wow!  Best ever!....effects.  Wow!
looks boring compared to VG
That didnt look like a soft landing
Actually i got a little choked up watching Jeff Bezos flight. It warms my heart 😢 seeing billionaires achieve their dream.
Clowns, what is space do you know? If you thinks space is 100-200 km then you stupids!!!
They could just use a jump room and go to Mars.
And still Leo hasn’t won an Oscar..
Ladies and Gentlemen, The Penis Rocket.
Браво 👏
why would we be excited about this, didnt we go to the MOON 50 years ago.
Yeah, they definitely went no near space.
The drama of the commentator is so cheesy.
Personally, I don't think he earned the title of Astronaut. He cheated.
Congratulations ❤️🎊🎊🎊🎊
Amazing how the footage that high seems to be missing. Why is that?
Первый ковбой полетел в космос! The first cowboy flew into space!
First human flight you say? Interesting claim!
300 кусков за 20 минут. Ну на  хер. Ждем Маска и полет на марс.
Today is the day!  Cheers!
how come they are allowed back to the earth?? That was not the deal!!!!
She is so corny 1:42:00 Did they not know that thing looks like a penis?
"Sir something came on our radar" "What is it?" "It looks like...."
First time a huge dildo penis shoots into space!!!
It seems that International Delivery of Goods is going to be optimised and brrrr..
No on-board video????
That was just like the thrill rides at amusement parks....only lasts a very short time.
This is not a special day. This is not challenging.
I wanted the rocket to blow up.... Sad it didn't blew up
paid by unpaid taxes

Congrats to human kind
Bezos was allowed to continue operations at Blue Origin when many of our businesses were closed during the pandemic.  The rich got richer, and the poor got poorer.
Well done - from no human rated vehicles in the US to three in the past two years, is a fantastic effort from SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, and now Blue Origin,... Y'all are making Boeing and 'old space' looking like dinosaurs staggering to extinction, being replaced by innovation and enthusiasm. The two sub-orbital vehicles are a strong start on going further for all of us. We're all looking forward to your orbital and interplanetary efforts.
Proud to be a human ❤️🤧
Thanks for not showing us that the earth is round. We wouldn't want to have any flat earthers proven wrong.
"Many countries have contributed to achieve this..."  Puts speed in MPH and height in FT. They could, at least in a small way and below the others, have also put the units in meters and KMH...
WTF!!! where's the view inside?
Weird to think in the future this may be normal.
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Not enough camera to show better flight . Just look how virgin did.👎👎👎
but now the packages are delivered like this?
I was really hoping he’d get stuck up there for a few hours…
I save money with amazon, products delivered next day, get great tv shows, and get to help this happen ... Amazon is pretty cool really.
First human flight???  Many have been to space🌌🚀 . Nothing special about this space not space trip, rockets went higher in the 1940s . Useless billionaire space toys.  Maybe if they actually want to make the world a better place, then they shouldn't waste money on worthless space toys.  Just another example of the rich trampling on the poor people of this world.  ⚡⚡
I don't believe I've ever watched a Blue Origin live stream where the proverbial question wasn't asked in the comments: "Why doesn't she STFU?" Ariane's enthusiasm is understandable, but dang, lady, learn to take a breath. That notwithstanding, good job, Team Blue!
https://youtu.be/Nt50N3YUxmk
Jeffs goes to space on the back of humanity...👎👎👎
If you bring industries to their home, They will destroy all of us. Help them help you by opening your eyes and ears. Pay close attention
Wow ...
How many subs can I get from this  Currently: 294
Poyehali! (C) Yuri Gagarin :-)
1:50:20 progressives started crying when they saw the successful parachutes
What a circus. Narration was too loud and energetic. No great worlds of wisdom for the moment. By contrast, Space X is so professional with their broadcasts. I watched for the historical moment of Wally Funk being the oldest person to go to space, but the rest of this broadcast I had to scan through. So over the top and boring.
Virgin Galactic: Beats Blue Origin by 9 days. Blue Origin: Has an actual virgin on board.
lol u dont need to be on NASA to be an astronaut.
Let's all be honest here Jeff Bezos just wanted to personally "Penetrate" the atmosphere lol.
ياو الارض مسنطحة هههههه
elon who ?
Congratulations! I can't wait to see more and more humans in space!!
the richest man to ever visit space!
Please do not call them astronauts, because they are only space tourists.
now that is an amusement park ride!
this kid has gotten more high than any teenager. Except the ones who took drugs. They were higher
teenagers in space!
Bill Gates be like: I'm not into space
Elon, get into space boy! Stop sitting on the sidelines!
This woman narrator just want raise
Elon, while having better rockets, is ultra keen for a space ride now, so that he too can have "commercial astronaut" on his Wikipedia biography
how many billionaire rocket companies do we need? I'd say 5 or 6 more. Mark? Sergey? anyone?
*"Who wants a Skittle ...?"* *Now he's got endorsement dough as well.  lol*
to think this guy earned 200 billion dollars before he went to space. I'd of thought the hard part was earning 200 billion, but in these primitive times, space is harder than that. God help us prehistoric baboons
I'm neither a pilot nor a member of the crew because I've flown in a plane. I'm a passenger.  You're neither an astronaut nor a member of the crew because you've flown in a rocket, you're a passenger.  There's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't diminish the experience or the accomplishment. But calling yourselves astronauts *does* diminish the experiences and accomplishments of real astronauts, professionals who have dedicated their lives to their careers. Please stop.
bit of a tease, but I wouldn't say no
Elon is laughing his head off watching these "astronauts"....
https://youtu.be/cGXd7CjIc-Q
Please tell me I'm not the only one who sees the face in the clouds at 1:40:33 on the right side of the screen.

This is pathetic, NOT space travel at all, it went up just a few miles above our heads for a few minutes. After almost 30 YEARS, blue origin was suppose to show us far better achievements....
Where are people from Brazil?🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Video copyright claimed by UMG 😓
Well wasnt that just mediocore and corny , wat a waste of money , blue origin seem to. Have a habbit of not wanting to relay video from thee crew cabin ,thiswas not exciting at all , virgin galactic had a better and more exciting debut launch than BO , youve be an idiot and a dumb arse if you want to waste money on a 10min ride like this i guarantee the hype wont last with this rollercoaster ride JEFF WHOOOOOO
Next space mission would be trip through black hole. Now that would be amazing
Great
Shut up bitch bo one wants to hear u talk
You can feel the excitement. It's palpable. I cried! Congratulations New Shepard and Blue Origin.💙
richest man in america funds a dick shaped rocket HA.
Bess achieved what kids dreams of character aside, what a feat!
Ah, I see Bezo's mid life crisis hasn't stopped yet
Forget the negative views of “rich people flying in space”. This is just the first step. Normalization of space travel is what we need. Say what you want about Bezos or the “hedge fund kid” that flew. This is what is going to further space travel and more importantly it’s going to further technology that makes us better equipped as a planet, all species included.
Congratulations and lots of respect to everyone, especially to Wally for staying fit at her age! Cheers
The narrator was quite excited during the launch, wasn't she? Made me smile.
Hopefully they make space travel more frequent for everyone
congratulations on your flight jeff bezos, billionaire of the 90s!!!!!
Thanks for sharing!
virgin galactic is best ,
why at 1:40:13 looks like theres 2 layers, one with background and the other with all the rest, just curious someone plz explain.   edit: it looks 2 layers because all the structure is shaking and the background looks still
Arcades from the eighties had more realistic images.
01:41:35 Fly
New slogan: 'Fly Amazon; Return Today'
The youngest astronaut, the oldest astronaut and the manufacturer of the rocket flying on the First Flight of the rocket with an amazing success! Honestly when I heard "Jeff has cleared the tower" those words made me so happy!
Blue origin is the patheticest space company ever, at least virgin could provide a stable video feed while achieving a higher altitude, not just that how tf are people appualisng this basic shit when spacex has been launching people into space for years, and they're about to open to private individuals, Blue origin is simply a money making scheme and charge super high prices of rubbish for 2minutes of some weightlessness. Ffs jeff get a real rocket and achieve fucking orbit
I'm not sure people are appreciating how crazy it is that it is Blue Origin and SpaceX doing these things and not NASA. NASA isn't what it used to be that's for sure. I guess those Nazi scientists ran a tight ship
Is it me or does this thing look like a dildo
Okok American
They need better cameras and camera direction- no video of them floating on board? But this is very nice and history.
https://youtu.be/9vXeF3u0Frc 😳🤯⬆️⬆️
.
Amazing!!!
https://youtu.be/9vXeF3u0Frc 🤯⬆️⬆️
SO we did this what ,50 years ago the exact way! What is the big deal? They didn't land up right and walk out did they?  No they parachuted,  just like all the years before. ... But hey it will make a profit  , right?
thats a penis!
These companies should do a $5.00 lottery for the average person to have a chance to go up. They would still make money and it would be good PR for these companies. So every flight takes one lotto winner up. A win - win for everybody!🤔😎🙂
Several notes.  First, that looks like a dildo.  Second, that launchpad looks like the trailer park version of Space-X.  Third. are we really counting that as space?  Fourth, Fuck Bezos. Finally let's stop referring to space tourists as astronauts.  It's insulting to actual astronauts.
Remember when bezos went to space in a giant vibrator?
Metric should be the only units used the space. Did you know MPH and FT are officially defined by the metric system? Metric is the units of SCIENCE and SPACE!   Also loved how the young person in the capsule asked at the end "Can I get that in Meters?".
Here's a free cookie 🍪
https://youtu.be/lga1_RLztFQ
This was great, but calling these guys, aside from Funk, astronauts seems like stolen valor...
So just the tip went into space?
Neil deGrasse Tyson was hating on Jeff Bezos on facebook for this. Screw him. Jeff Bezos has taken a large step in getting mankind into space. Just what has Neil deGrasse Tyson done to personally contribute to the space program? He goes on social media and slams the people who are actually advancing the space program???  Neil deGrasse Tyson is acting like a Luddite to appease his far-left, extremist fan base.
Awesome 👍
So thats it? They went for like 10mns and came back? Da fuck
she was annoying.
wish the narrator audio channel could have been muted for the duration of this live broadcast. Feels more like an unscripted NBC newscast vs. how well others such as spacex handle live launch broadcasts.
Of course no cabin views, cost 250k to see that. Why did I waste an hour after work watching this?
https://youtu.be/FgDs12NpIcc
Wish we could actually watch larger video of the crew instead of split screen with the commentary...

Is the body not moving....? 1:52:05 & 1:52:26
They got to 351,200+ feet...just shy of the international line considered to be space which is 380,000 feet. Actual space is still about 6.5 million feet (1,240 miles) away. How the hell did they get to the moon again? The Moon orbits approximately 238,500 miles from Earth.
When signing off, what were her (Ariane Cornell) last 2 words? Sounded like "Verdadum Verasiter"
So how long were they in space?

historic moment!!!!yesssssssss!!!11 we go in the espace!!!
Wheres the flat earthers?
Did they get the idea for the design of the rocket from Dr Evil?
For some reason, I was expecting a UFO Ship LoL
1969 true?
Anybody else thought the landing was a bit rough?
Worst self-centered commentator ever.
Didn't even touch space, basically paid millions for a porter potty "skydive" without the fun of freefalling.
Hola paaaaa
Big money for 10 minutes flight
Jeff Bezos is a criminal because he is collaborating with the criminal US Army.  The US military kills children and women in Yemen
Un dia espero que mi Mexico querido tambien valla hacia las estrellas. 🇲🇽   And to Jeff Bezos, as well as NASA, ESA, and Elon Musk, you guys are doing an awesome job!! It's going to be amazing when Mars will be stepped on by mankind!
Underwhelming
This is actually so insane. In 50 years just like most people have been on a plane, think of how many people will have been to space 🤯🤯🤯
They had better video coverage the last time they launched a dummy into space.
1:41:30 T-10
Hmm, still no internal camera footage of the flight...
5 guys and not one opened the door for Wally Funk? Smh.
No lie I thought the title said “First Human Fleshlight”
I don't mean to be that person, but where is the diversity????
But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.  1 John 1:7
🖕bezos
Since i've flown in an airplane does that make me a pilot?  Meat ballast in a capsule an astronaut it does not make.  Jeff Bezos is an astronot
https://youtu.be/mL7-GYufTc8
Now lets explore the depths of the oceans..
Van Allen radiation belt extends from an altitude of about 640 to 58,000 km (400 to 36,040 mi) above the Earth surface.
Me 🙁
It came back?
Jeff Bezos: _"Hey Richard.. You're right..."_ Richard Branson: _"What's that?"_ Jeff Bezos: _"Elon Musk looking really small from up here."_ 🙃 Richard Branson:  "😂😂😂😂"
Jeff giving Wally the best 7 minutes she has had in a long time.   One day, maybe he can actually do some orbital runs.
My favorite part was when Jeff handed someone his (now) trademark hat before entering the capsule only to emerge from the capsule (and "space") with the hat on his head.  Fraudsters gotta fraud!
Jeff Bezos is going to space just for leisure, while there’s people who are looking in the trash for food
Why do I think all the rich billionaires are trying to get out because they know we’re fucked in the next 20 to 40 years from pollution?
Astronaut Wally… YAY 😁☝️☝️☝️🚀🚀🚀💕💕💕
1:42:39 🤣🤣🤣🤣 what does it look like lol
Jeff 🤡
CEO. entrepreneur, born in 1964, Jeffrey. Jeffrey Bezos!
What a pathetic waste of money and resources.
"Incredible astronauts"? I'm happy for them, but if any astronauts are incredible, they are the Apollo astronauts, especially of Apollos 8, 11, and 13.
The only thing I'm disappointed about was the lack of live interior views. I hope we get a later video with interior views during launch and flight.
2:00:07 - Who else went with Bezos, did he take his nan?
works of the hand of God. sounds of nature to relax.
If you think about it, what part of the rocket entered space? Just the tip.
Richard Branson’s looked better. This was kinda boring. And seemed like a big commercial with the electric Rivian truck driving them up there.
Enquanto vocês estão ai lendo isso, eu estou aqui sentado num sofá que custa 7.000, e abraçando uma almofada de 350,00 reais, e assistindo ao filme de "animais fantásticos" em uma Smart TV LED 70" UHD que custa " 4.700, e nada me incomoda, nem mesmo o olhar dos funcionários das Casas Bahia, que aparentemente querem que eu saia da loja porque eles já vão fechar.
Where are Torys engines???
Jackass 4 trailer came out. It's on Steve-Os channel.

Best part 1:43:50
This is amazing! Hahaha I was here to see it. Awesome!
Well, yes it was an accomplishment for Re-useable rocket. Secondly a good ground landing. However, no orbits around the planet were completed. Extended mission would require a heat shield probably greater that presently fitted. Also exposure to radiation once on and extended mission would require Suiting. This was something of a joy ride but as i make that statement it diminishes the hard work engineering up to this point placed into this effort.  I expected more is probably closer to this effort. Rocketry is ancient space technologies Of what is required of what we must develop to explore our galaxy. Yes our galaxy just not our solar system or going to the moon or Mars
SOOoOooooooo AMAZING ‼️😍✨👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Fantastic four origins
At 1:30:00 starts
One of the most beautiful moments of this month <3
Please use SI measurement units.
Congratulations for all the team!
What you came here for: 1:41:30
Definitely all the elites are going to start a pedo planet .
Bezos for President
This woman is annoying
WHY ON EARTH is the "Rescue Socket" for the emergency release of the door using a 7/16ths SAE standard unit?  It's 2021 and this is a gawddamned ROCKET!  Are you kidding me?
1:37:16 eyyyyyy! 420!
Hi Jeff
who cares some rich dickheads go up really high for a couple minutes. so stupid
Omg this woman. Please stfu
STFU woman!!
God this presenter is irritating and cringe AF!
Would have been nice to see inside the capsule
💜💛💛💛
Yo jeff can you please increase my wage
Flat Earth "community ",  buy one ticket for one of your leaders if you dare.😏😏😏
100% fake
I hate to break it to everybody but this isn’t the first human flight.
Congratulations Blue origin. A lot of people may not realise this but this was all done without a pilot on board, i.e automated. Wow, just wow. Looking forward to space tourism. When can I buy my ticket 🖖😃🎬👽
Tanta tecnología y no ponen 1 puta cámara mirando al horizonte o hacia el espacio....
No it’s no. Lol. Bunch of brainwashed, fairy tale believing sheep. Santa is real too folks. And the Easter bunny. Lol.
Boring.  But hey, remember the guy sitting in the lawn chair being carried off by helium balloons to the stratosphere? That was amazing!
The "Road To Space" was CLEARLY marked at a posted 10 MPH speed LIMIT.  They were going at least 4 times that on the drive to the pad...   just sayin'.
2:07:45 building forward

jeff bezos is not welcome back
This just looks like a very bad sci fi movie
something looks fishy
What the dog doin
I waste my time Bye
Lmfao
They should’ve named that Rocket Blue Balls, looks like a………..
I'm excited to see Elon musk's reply
I think Hitler retreated with the top nazi brass to the centres of the Earth gaining power and technology and now are flying objects that we can't identify in our air spaces.
Funny how they dont show inside
Fake
2021 and this is the shit footage we get.
I think elon musk needs to teach these company's how to get HD footage of there flight paying millions to get to space but can't even get HD FOOTAGE of there flights  not only virgin galactic stream blue origin too  I am all for space travel learning about it ect but it's a joke staying up late with my generation of kids just not to be able to watch it live
Skip to 1.43..... You're welcome.
This episode of Westworld is off the charts.
Congrats 🍾
Tanta tecnología pero la cremallera está ahí. Un invento que posiblemente tarde cientos de años en ser superado por otro tipo de cierre de ropa 😁
LMAO what a joke  1:50:19  the Chinese did better CGI so called landing on Mars....  Not saying it didn't happen- just dont add in extra bullshhhhhit when there were no vehicles cameras are emergency crew anywhere either crafts.
Κουκλοθέατρο ... Τι Αμερικανικά ξεφτιλίκια, είν' αυτά. LOL!
Fun Fact: This was filmed in a studio on a set
Clothing brand is called tropic. Be a dream come true to collab🌊🏝❤️
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Great replay but why all the ads goddamn!
OMG Jeff bezoz didn't die ffs 😠😠 he really isnt human then  know I no
Check out this new adventure ....the adventure of #jeremydewitte and crooked judge keith Carstens
Amazing, Humbling, And a monumental moment for the next generation.
Only people that believes this is real are the stupid Amazon worker's. Fake as shit. Just like Richard Brandon's flight.
Bezos could've stayed...
Gamer moment
You planet needs science and data payloads which need affordable vehicles.  These are reusable and affordable, and have already been launching those science payloads.  Or you can let the government keep wasting money on huge pork-barrel rockets like the SLS (Senate Launch System) which are NOT reusable or affordable.  But what whould we expect from officials elected by our neighbors who dictate to NASA what their science will be?  The adventure was the first funding to open the door to sensible reusable systems.

I don't like this kind of touchdown...looks like not very comfortable..
Anyone know if there is a version of this without the girl talking? I actually want to hear the engine she is talking over constantly.
Congratulations on an extremely successful mission. Inspiring.
O FUTURO É AGORA Aquilo que assistíamos no passado nos filmes e desenhos animados está virando realidade no presente. Aulas virtuais e home office em escala mundial é uma realidade, vieram para serem mesclados com o presencial, sem a volta total do sistema antigo. Os carros elétricos são produzidos em larga escala e aos poucos estão substituindo os antigos de combustiveis fósseis. Os carros voadores já entraram em testes, com produção em larga escala nos próximos anos. Os voos espaciais por civis já estão em andamento, com previsão de tornar-se um lugar comum viagem de turismo para o espaço com estada em hotéis dentro de estações orbitais e até na Lua e Marte. Nanotecnologia, realidade virtual, inteligência artificial já são coisas comuns. Na realidade, estamos destruindo o nosso planetinha e se preparando para uns poucos felizardos morararem no espaço. A despeito de tudo isto, eu queria regredir e passar o resto do meu tempo dentro de um sítio no interior, em contato com a natureza na Amazónia onde moro.
Congrats guys! Man, what the last few years have brought us spaceships wise, just insane!
Finnlly watch out ur shepard same way i told u watch out ur keys do u remember ???now holes with lava roams but kys are death
it's a fake just like the moon landing
https://youtube.com/shorts/b3CzweYWPhg?feature=share
so wen these lot actually going to the moon then ?
Same example still there very expensive part festure in air craft but i kept it wuite while when markets screem need for more facility then ill present more crestivity till thst of need im waiting
Flight been catch the theory from eagles  and many other birds like electricity been invented by edison by update time while all features got old to use electricty in new forms been dicovered later in between few features might be mine same case of first flight
All of this for 2 min in Zero G ? That's all ?
#peniship
I wan to see wat happen inside the capsule at the space…..quite disappointed there is no camera show that
The mile high club has a VIP section now.
Pen3 volador xd
Норм
It's fake AF. Bezos wasn't in it, I'm 100% sure. No cabin footage = fakery
Congratulations, nice video! Now as people are watching this video from all over the word, launch telemetry should be in Kilometers (not in Miles and feets), just like SpaceX and other video launchs do.
why did'nt the bald man stay up their in space.
Galera quem gostar do meu conteúdo e puder me ajudar, e vou está deixando meu pix aqui em baixo, qualquer valor será bem vindo. Obrigado por assistir e Tmj.   Pix: Edvaniltonmoreira07@gmail.com
its like only blue orgin and jeff have said only us billionaire or who's paid for the flight get to see space but isn't showing the younger generations the point if they only see a white rocket flying up then back down abit shit for them they will think I'd rather just get on a plane we'll have better views

will there be a video of the crew inside the cabin for amazon prime subscribers only...that was preety lame video if I'm honest atleast virgin and Richard Branson had a video inside of his
https://youtu.be/yG_7qo1ZMNI
*GREAT!! - But it is NOT SO GOOD like this one* kkkk youtube.com/watch?v=HeULZx0EwHM300
why can we see the look inside the cabin  during this launch ? come on .
Yay? I mean Elon has been doing this for years he just hasn't gotten on one, he totally could gave gotten the record years ago
I feel so so like in Kitty Hawk Hahahaha
Austin Powers vibes are strong with this ship shape
1:40:34 Has this thing been sitting on Tatooine for years?
Everything was great.... except Ariane Cornell not knowing when to reduce the throttle on her mouth.  Thankfully, they also had an unnarrated stream that CNBC has on their channel where you could take in the launch, the sound of the rocket, and the landing without the extraneous verbal commentary.
bOOOOO! THIS WASN'T A SPACE TRIP WORTH 250,000 DOLLARS! this was like being on a hot air balloon then free falling back to earth! This was pure bullshit,,,,,,,,
Disgusting hubris.
Is it just me or is it biggest dildo launched in to space?
John 11:25-26  25.Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: 26.And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? Mark 1:15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel. John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Acts 16:32 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.  May Father God bless you all in our Lord and Savior's name, Jesus Christ, amen!
I am missing something? Why "First" human flight? how about the moon landing 1969?
Wow! Can't wait till I can go🙏🤣

Soooo, what did this accomplish exactly?
T -1 Minute starts at 1:42:11
why not inside cabin live video?
what a joke, this is all lies wake up people
Meanwhile SpaceX is testing the launch of a literal skyscraper
can't hate on Bezos, cause that's what you do when you got that kind of money. you go to space and treat your friends.
This is Bezos, why didn't he have different channels with different announcers and we could choose who to listen to. I would've liked to hear from someone a little more technical, and knew when to keep quiet.
Congratulations Jeff, welcome to the club!
What is the credit for the music credit that is playing as the video opens (Tip, it's not the song cited in the Description, so don't go there...).
Awesome flight🚀, its cool👌 how the capsule's windows big👍& love the crackling sounds when liftoff from those BE-3s
T+03:42 'unreal'! The only thing that ever went to space is our imagination!
Man, i love Wally Funk's energy.
That ship looks like something out of a Mel Brooks movie.  Unbelievable gall to make a ship min his "in your dreams" likeness.
Here we go civilian spaceflight!
proud to be part of this historic moment
the crew of the capsule have been paralyzed from the trip ... or they are just dolls !! ..they are not moving or have been shocked !!
Seven continents?  I thought there were 5...
Congrats to Jeff Bezos and crew, another piece of history written in the books - who else got goosebumps from the sound of the twin sonic booms!?
What 0 G ?, the only point that could have 0 g is at apogee for some second and when free falling. While going up there is more than 1G.
She was an obnoxious narrator!!
Was hoping for fireworks 🎆  😞
Watch your billionaire overlord try out an amusement park ride he designed for himself.
The World: Is on fire, in a pandemic, economic disparity, etc. Beezos: *spaceship go brr*
This is a joke.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwimocU0IIc  LAME! It just doesnt look the same, why the crap angle and crap camera? why ALL the focus on the damn rocket, how boring. i wanna see the earth.
💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Its great that  what jeff and richard  did for their own company take risk... but we all knwo why they had to do this.... elon wont have to do this because his company.pany making profits andgetting contracts..but BO and VG had to give a demo with their owners in it to convince their customers i guess...
THIS NARRAtor is garbage.  She doesnt shut up during the good parts
No go pro in cabin?  Lmao. Wtf Jeff.  Cant afford it?
I dont see a UFO.  Does anyone else?  Apparently a UFO was seen during lift off when they are really high up
AMAZING!!!!
Emotional day for sure. Wish I could afford a ride too.  Best day ever for all.
It's a giant cock and balls, man!
IT WAS JUST INCREDIBLE!!! WELL DONE
If  you want to accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, then IT'S EASY! All you have to do is do what Romans 10:9-10 says, " If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved." ( that is from the NIV or New International Version). Just believe and declare that Jesus is Lord.  Jesus provides salvation for all of us once we give our lives to Him.  REMEMBER: THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO HEAVEN IS THROUGH JESUS  Jesus is the mediator ( He bridges the gap between God and humankind). Give your life to Him today. He wants to have a relationship with you. And what's amazing is that you can come as you are to Him. He loves you :)    GOD BLESS EVERYONE WHO IS READING THIS :)
WHERE WILL YOU GO WHEN YOU DIE?   What day will it happen? Today? Tomorrow?   One hundred and fifty thousand people die every day. How many of them were ready?  When you stand before God on that day will you go to heaven or hell?   Jesus Christ tells us that unless you’re born again you will not see the kingdom of God. You will be judged for your sins; all of the lies, the immoral thoughts, stealing, blaspheming and justly sentenced to hell.  But you don’t have to go to hell. Jesus Christ tells us that whosoever repents of their sins and trusts in him can be saved. Jesus paid the penalty of your sins on the cross at Calvary two thousands years ago.   What sin is worth an eternity in hell? Think how precious your eyes are to you, what would it take to sell your eyes? And how much for valuable the soul that looks out of those eyes? Don’t go to hell, repent and trust in Jesus and be saved.
Money for nothing, the troubles are on the Earth, no in the space.
NASA, Branson or Bezos?? If they can build Mil Spec it would be no problem; how many Shuttle/ISS parts came from around the world? It's the SHTF moments you have to take into consideration and NASA has handled more of those than can be told.
Austin powers approved
I'm glad the rich folks made it back safely .now maybe they can pay their fair share of taxes instead of finding loopholes not to pay any.
Congrats Jeff! A brilliant feat for Humankind
Походу заметно что запуск делался в спешке, Брэнсона наверное обскакать хотели. Лучше б отложили на пару месяцев раз уж всё равно проиграли туристическую космическую гонку да сделали всё как следует - нормальный наземный комплекс, а не наскоро сляпаный, отработанная процедура запуска, вышколенный персонал. Ну в общем как у Бренсона чтоб было.
Congrats Jeff, and team!
Hearing crew audio with Wally constantly yelling is hilarious
Did I miss the astronauts?  All I see are space tourists.
Kkkk
Can we all acknowledge how genuinely happy and excited Sarah looks when talking to the crew?
They deservet 💪💯👍
Всё это очень мило но пусть лучше Нью Гленн доделают, вот тогда их будет за что уважать. А эта игрушка для богатеньких уважения не вызывает.
They are passengers not fuckin astronauts
They don't get out to the real space, it was only a test of the rocket, the rocket must be transmitted video and capsule to, not only the rocket descending final time.

History in the making...
good job
This video is gonna be watched by all space enthusiasts for the years to come
Only in American can u build ur own penis shaped rocket and leave earth
Commentary was embarrassingly awful. But I loved seeing the video from inside the capsule! Lol
epico, now go find us some space cat waifus!
They Use the parachutes because the tip is the most sensitive part.
Sorry but this isn't space, it's just another overpriced vomit comet. No re-entry, no risk, no orbit, not space.
Whaoooooo💪😅
what's with the phallic design?
Please just shut up :|
“Listen to the roar of the engine”  Narrator: *Yes but actually no*
*🤩desafio VC a não rir assistindo...*    *m£us desenhos animados🤪*
Please send Bezos to space with Bill Gates as a travelling partner.
Oggi ho vissuto una giornata importante di storia che un giorno  i miei nipoti studieranno na scuola 😀
If you send that watch to me, I'll set it to the correct time.
imagine paying 28 million for a 5 minute elevator ride.
Well done, Jeff. Wish all the best to you and Blue Origin!
1:43:00  for launch.  This thing is very phallic!  :-)  I really like the big windows in the capsule!  Wow, what a view!
Х_й в космос запустили и радуются.
ومن هذا نستنتج ان الارض مسطحه و شكرا 😊
nice camera... looks like a fly in the moon, cant see anything... sure... zero G, no video proof? sure...
Amazing achievement! But does this help us keeping the planet healthy? I mean how much energy, waste, Co2, does an average human use/produce compared to this?
The cabin footage can be checked in the post-flight conference .
Hollywood movie 🤦‍♀️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡 What a joke 🤣🤣🤣🤣 how long they will lie about all this “ trips “:))))
i think this was much more impressive than Richards flight well done all
The coolest thing I've ever seen on the internet!
Can't even express my feelings about what was just achieved.  No more limits in the space for human being !  Young and old, everybody can conquer it !
Flat earther after going on this trip,  F.E - "This ain't space. You are showing me Mr.Bezos's bald blue colored head. Give me my money back"🤨🤬  Astronomer - "Do you atleast agree that Mr.Bezos's head is not flat?"😕  F.E - "Na, his head's also FLAT." 😤  Astronomer - "Then what do you think you are seeing?"😬  F.E - "You guys fooling people in the name of space when in reality you people are just showing edited bald blue coloured head of Mr.Bezos in a theater"😠😤  Astronomer - "😵"
Nice, but too bad they show only the archaic imperial units of measurement
Pretty cool
60 years ago, on April 12, 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Alekseevich Gagarin made the world's first flight into outer space. The Vostok-1 spacecraft took off from Baikonur at 9:07 a.m. Moscow time. The flight duration was 108 minutes.
I don't understand why they emphasise "The First Human Flight".  Branson did it.  and all of the real Astronauts going to the Moon and back.  Somebody explain please.
I just checked my account balance.. will settle with a economy class ticket for now..
Congratulations to Blue Origin team. I like the post space exposure changed perspective thought. Kudos 🎉🎉🎉
It’s unfortunate to see that the flat earthers and space deniers are already in the comments 🤡 go troll somewhere else
does anybody recorded inside of the starship ? Or does they forgot it ? kkkkkkkkkkkk
*BREAKING*  Wally Funk fell asleep and missed the whole thing..internal footage confirms.
E
The overall boarding process and plattform is quite ghetto...way to go mr bezos....get some structures build and maybe so e asphalt?
The video the editing is all of such a low production standard. Virgin Galactic did a much better job of sharing the journey.
https://youtu.be/fpbcYVGRDJ4  🤠
We should of been doing this since the 60s. But everyone gave up because starting wars would be more beneficial.
congrats, blue origin. well done!
Mr. Elon musk won't sleep tonight, until he makes something crazy then that 😂😂
Me: What an achievement for Jeff Bezos! Conspiracy theorist: How do you know that Jeff Bezos was there ? Me: But I saw him enter the cabin. He was there when the rocket took off and he left right after the landing. Conspiracy theorist: It's all fake, just like Gagarin, the moon landing and the curved earth ! All is fake, payed by the military and NASA to keep us away from the truth !  Go argue ...
Lies all lies and just a distraction at this time
The best quotation from Jeff Bezos:  " You can start from small and make it big "
[Check 7:45-7:55 & Also 31:00-31:16 &  ] - Fuck.. 𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗱 "𝗔𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗢𝗡𝗢𝗧𝗦" 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗮𝘂𝘁𝘀 🤣🤣🤣🤣  "𝗔𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗢𝗡𝗢𝗧𝗦"- from Director of Astronaut & Orbital Sales , an MBA from  @HarvardHBS  & Honors - B.S.Field Of StudyScience, Technology from @Stanford   HOLY SHIT !!
Outstanding!
That's what my dick looks like.
USA BEST💙💙💙💙
This narrator just cannot stand herself.
What BS
https://youtu.be/szJoFwsltSA hi
Without belittling such a historical moment. But you guys couldn't have been more modest with entitling the program. You are 60 years late with the First Human Flight. And Jeff? You took your cowboy hat to space, didn't you? Congratulations on the first cowboy hat flight!
but now the packages are delivered like this?
Top Ten Things Bezos Did Better Than Branson  1. Everything 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10.
I predict this space tourism will be out of business in 6 months to a year.   Way too expensive for a few minute ride.  Now the larger rocket going to LEO will survive, maybe thrive.
Space is fake
Why is the kid from Netherlands and not from the USA where he made his big money? 🤣😅 interesting
What's the name of the music at the start.?Amazing
Excellent demonstration... of how much more advanced Spacex is.
Вот глупец Безос, лучше бы потратил эти деньги на роскошный дворец с золотыми унитазами - это ведь куда интересней, чем слетать в космос ;)
Good luck to all the employees who work for amazon and virgin with basic salaries while their bosses with their Trillions in their banks(not even, cause they get taxed) make unnecessary flights to the space.
what a garbage. bullshit. waste of money, instead of help poor people, lets make a circus for monkeys. yes yes, the evolution has failed.
https://youtu.be/m15IOamQUiE
Unbelievable,  they spend all this money on development, assembly, testing;  but didn't put in a simple live cam in the cabin to show the passengers floating about.    Maybe Bezos didn't want to be recorded crapping his pants, or puking from motion sickness.    Now that would be entertainment!
Love was a man who was nailed through his hands and feet into a cross before that he was whipped and wore a crown of thorns, he committed no crime or sin,but his blood was paid to use for our sins, his name is  Jesus Christ! Do you know him? † He loves you so very much! 🤍☁️  Jesus Loves You, Don’t Forget To Pray! He Is Here To Help You! cast All Your burdens to him! He cares. I Hope You Have An Amazing Day 🖤🙌🏻 - John 14:6 King James Version 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.
The initial ascent scene from 1:43:21 to 1:43:30 looks like CGI, so good is the drone footage. It reminds me of a specific Sci-Fi TV show showing several rockets launching at the same time from (I think) Mars. I thought it was in the The Expanse Intro but I'm not sure now.
I call bullcrap, there is a firmament that you cannot go through, LOL.
Congratulation from 💛🇧🇷💚 Marilia -SP Mauricio M. Corrêa  Thank you, for contribution, to the cause. We are only one, and everyone. 🌎
I don’t think flying into the atmosphere then coming back down to earth counts as going to space.
Tax. The. Rich.
*Yawns 😴
Those cringe billionaires should focus on environemental issus and overpopulation, yet they are nothing more than wannabe tech revolutionaries. True geniuses aren't made with a fortune but with a vision.
How interesting to live now
*Really* hope the full flight recording comes out at some point.
That was really impressive! But it's a bit embarrassing that you weren't able to show the metric data. Maybe you didn't expect someone from "the rest of the world" to be watching?
Começou a corrida espacial
There was nobody inside The Capsule that's why they had no live video feed Like Richard Branson did ...we didn't get to see them float around in zero gravity we didn't get to see the curvature of the Earth because then we would see it was a big hoax. These people must think that we're a bunch of idiots but we're not
Amazing! Congratulations to the crew and all Blue Origin team members!
Me: The entire west coast is on fire Jeff Bezos: Haha space go brrrrrrrrr
Best thing Jeff did was to give Wally Funk the opportunity to go to space
Завораживает. Это очень круто!
Superb. Bota

B.O.T.A.
Lol, he truly was…. SECOND!, 🤣🤣🤣
I am very happy! This is a new achievement for all mankind! Congratulations, from Russia!
you need to look up *SFM21XT* on YouTube hold your coins ❤️
At a time when people's responsibility must be focused on protecting the environment, we are witnessing insane pollution and a DEMONstration of unnecessary costs that are being made to satisfy one's #ego. The real cosmos is not somewhere outside, but only inside. #Infinity is inward . All this shown in the video is a demonism in action. It is a pity that the planet is heading for its catastrophe, precisely because of such obsessed souls.
Did they have to pick someone with the most annoying voice to host this?

I'm old enough to remember the very first suborbital flight of Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom.  When you watched them on TV, you got to see the first couple minutes, followed by about 7 or 8 minutes of Walter Cronkite, Frank McGee or Jules Bergman (depending on what network you were watching) sitting behind a desk and commenting on the radio traffic between the capsule and the Cape.  And then you got to see the capsule again once its chutes were deployed and it had come down low enough to be in camera range again.  I watched the coverage on the Weather Channel (Jim Cantore, I love ya, but you're no Cronkite), and was able to see the capsule the entire time from liftoff to touchdown...even at 330,000 ft,  but there was no need to "fill in" at the studio because it out of camera range (not that I would have complained about 7 or 8 minutes of Stephanie Abrams)  Oh, the awesome improvements in technology I've seen in my life.

in 2021 year ther ist fucking selfie from space,ther ist video with no gravitation,or amazon boss no have mony fo GoPro camera ?
boo
Of course they won’t show the view. This is just a trailer. You want to see the view….find a million dollars for a 10mins ride or go watch live from space on youtube for free 😁 thank me later
Поздравляю! Новый шаг к звёздам. Жаль у Гагарина не Было прямых трансляций
Please fail
красиво, молодці...  але довго виходили :)
Was this some kind of home-made self promoted narration ?  I hope it was 🤦🏻‍♂️
Is there a mannequin aboard because the astronaut in the window shown hasn’t moved a bit.
What a joke.
No footage inside the cabin? Seriously? Come on, fire the marketing people. Thats just frustating and dumb. So much money and they forgot the GoPro inside the cabin? I just cant belive in this. Nobody remembered the importance of recording internal images and their point of view? How did this happen?
Jesus said: I am the light that came into the world, so that everyone who believes in me does not remain in darkness. - John 12:46    I confessed to you my sin, and my iniquity did not I cover. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and you forgave the guilt of my sin. - Psalm 32:5    That at the name of Jesus every knee may bow to those in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth. - Philippians 2:10    Let all who seek you rejoice and rejoice in you. Let those who love your salvation continually say: Great be the Lord. - Psalm 40:16  Lift up your heads, O gates; arise, O eternal gateways, and the King of Glory shall enter. Who is the King of Glory The mighty and mighty Lord, the mighty Lord in battle. - Psalm 24:7-8
😂😂😂
SpaceBurgers that what make you a fucking billionaire!!!!!!
And tomorrow the mass media will say how normal people shouldn't drive cars and how to travel by plane is too much damaging to the environment but here we have a billionaire that can go up in space and that probably has a couple of private jets that he uses every month...
they need to speed up this shit....we still no where with space exploration
Poggers
Fake
детский  лепет какой-то
Good job!
now thats a 10 min thrill ride, you gotta take a 4hr flight before the Virgin one lol
CONGRATULATIONS

Watch Saber City II
Фейк, почему не показали полёт изнутри???
Whatsup with that man holding his is fist and acting so hyped?!
The woman commentator was sure annoying...
What , so this capsule is opened what looks to be some kind of milwauke tool?!?!
Gosh she has such a annoying voice :-(  Don't know what it is, but there is something in her voice I can't stand. Everyone else: Astronauts. She: Ash'shte'shnouds 1:52:21
Congrats Blue Origin Team, its Architects, and Jeff, u opened the Space for our kids
10 1/2 minutes of flight followed by two hours of Bezos bragging and patting himself on the back.
Congratulations all! Now let's get a hotel in orbit!
That female announcer was awful. A five year old would have narrated better.
Meh
One day i will go Mars and also come back here🙂
Bravo! Hello from Russia!
you go to space and use feet as units? ... use the metric system for god sake. :)
Very cool!! Congrats Blue Origin and humanity! Another win for Earth!
Ну где там Симоняша ??? Расчехляйте стерха уже...
Idi i nevračaj se!
Richard Branston was
Tag NDT for why we don't have high quality footage of UFOs now!  Its 2021 cmon.
Vote...Jeff's Blue Origin Or Richard's Virgin Galactic....my vote is for Richard. Looks like Shuttle Aircraft, perfect take off n Landing...  Jeff's Blue origin is not a bad experiment either.... 👇👇👇 What Say Guys..
🚀🛸🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🔥
Richard Branson marketed their flight way better.  This looks like the work of a retiree learning new iPhone features.
The world's most expensive carnival ride.
Is it just me or does it look like some part of a human anatomy 🤔
I really like the fact that the family can see and greet their beloved ones the minutes after they return from space, the same way you meet your family in the airport after a long flight.
"space" earths atmosphere extends to the moon
2:01:46 Awkward high five
Fist humam flight? What about Virgin Galactic?
what was that flying by at 1:48:53 - 1:48:55 lol it almost hit the booster >.<
didnt get the astronots spelling thing..31:00 sorry ESL .. what was that?
I don't care who was first or the best or highest or lowest. I only care about progression. We need to be in space, we're decades behind where we should have been. All of these companies do it for the money but it doesn't matter, we need progress. We need to travel somewhere else, faster then you realize.
BRASIL POW POW
Congratulations! Very good job, Captain Picard !
Big Day in humans history
What? The other ones before Bezos weren't they human too?
Millions of dollars were spent to send a billionaire into space for 10 minutes and some Americans can't afford their medical insurance.  God bless America
no such thing as hugx or not, cepyuax, any infix relatx any nmw, and move body expresx any , idts
What a beautiful mission, congrats to all Blue Origin team!! It's so special watching Wally Funk's dream coming true. Thank you, Jeff Bezos.
looked like a hard landing....
Blue Origin = top adrenaline rush experience Virgin Galactic = transcendence trip experience.  ...both life changing experiences.
Way to go Jeff Who?, hopefully orbit soon? let's get multiple private station up and in the orbit as per vision of Blue Origin
Abysmal coverage.
the rich see what the fuck mankind is going to and are looking for ways to wait out in orbit))))
I thought I would never live to see the day , we finally have a flying dildo rocket
Would it be a crime if we got altitude and speed in SI units? Couldn't they find someone else to comment? Guy should have done the talking by himself
1:57:18 look closely at the capsule. It feels like it's slightly shifting and just edited in, lmao. Probably just lens distortions, but Imagine it's all fabricated. :D
I'm sure very soon someone will come up with a technology or an equation or a solution to manipulate gravity...for smoother landing...
No footage will be shown until others sign up!  Why take away the mystery before other paying customers sign up.
So how many revolutions did the Earth make while they were in space? 😂
Worst host ever, I hated her commentary. This stream would have been a lot better without her.
This woman... what a terrible narrator.
Is it just me, or does this rocket look like a flying penis?
Creo que la mejor nave la tiene VG, más cómo su despegue y aterrizaje
Coming back to the home and celebrate like this.... Oh god such a cool and history moment... I felt that flight with Jeff bro.. Congras the entire team. 😍😍🚀🚀🚀🚀👍👍👍👍
An incredibly redundant vehicle? I love it!! 😄😄
Американцы молодцы ,конечно!
Have to say, my fav moment in all of this was seeing the entire Blue Origin team cheer in the auditorium. This is Y'ALL'S hard work and innovation. Congrats 👏
*А что звучит погчампово.*
thank GOD we did this!!! instead of working on poverty or hunger or climate change!!! this was totally worth it!!!! Jeffrey, you did it!!!!!!
Just because Iam a passenger in an airplane, doesn't make me a pilot.
Congrats to Wally Funk on finally getting her lift and returning safely 60 years after the Mercury 13. :)
Congratulations! A true trailblazer, leading human expansion into space.
Richard Branson called to congratulate Bezos on passing the Karmen line. He was quoted as saying: "We may not have gone as high, but at least, we did not look like a flying penis."
what a waste of resources.... oooo look at me im just slightly higher than a standard 747.... lame think of all the people that could be housed, fed, and educated with 1% of what this arrogant a-hole''s money...   Just wish these uber rich would actually remember where the f they came from... and maybe grow some sort of consciousness .... good luck filling that black hole you call a soul bezo the clown....
You know what could make this flight even better? Metric system. Regarding that, congratulations everybody. Incredible time we are living today
but second after Virgin
я больше орнул с коментов под этим видео,чем с самого полёта. у людей в башке такой винегрет что просто пиздец
Congratulations for the succesful flight to space and the awesome return. Great Blue Origin team and crew. Thanks for this historical moment.
Why insist on the Von Kármán line at "100Km", and then spew out altitudes and speeds of the rocket in "feet" and "miles" ? I'm sure that 18yo kid from the Netherlands would rather know he was above 100Km than above 62 miles, for instance. Almost every other company/agency has switched to the metric system already.
"Listen to the roar of the engine" Yes I'd like to, if only there wasn't a narrator talking over the sound!
The hats
$28 million for a seat... and there's no stairs for passengers? I will wait to buy my ticket when there are elevators and in-flight service. ;-)
Congratulations to the entire Blue Origin team, what an achievement !!
No metric measurements for altitude. What a joke!
Congrats to Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos, and the other Austronauts on this major accomplishment.  I'm curious....what's the name of that SUV that took the team to the launching pad? I like it!!!!
Я ждал подобного полета еще с 2012 года, наконец-то я стал свидетелем этого чуда
everything is fake, congratulation for this wonderful movie, next time we should see george cloony in the cabin
Not bad but Space x does it better.
Simply rich boys playing with rich toys. This rich white man space race is complete exploitation. With wealth stolen from their works and the people. Don't just drone on in awe of this take heed into the real world harm that these capitalists neglect.
This is emotional! 👐
,,INCRÍVEL..ESPETACULAR..
So much fun of watching this! Am I the only one that feeling flying to space is no longer a dream! But only if you’re able to afford $250k per trip 🤣🥲🙌🏻
Too expensive!!!max 500$...hahaha
Haha słabe...poland
I love Wally!!
Cabin audio in 2021 ???? A bit poor
Cheers to the entire team🎉🤟🏼
God created man and left intelligence to Jeff Bezos
Stupidest comment section I've ever seen. There is no camera live feed because there is a paying customer on board, and because the media team would want to make it look as good as possible before showing it. They wouldn't want to jeopardise the image of Jeff or his family either. There ARE cameras on board, just not live. Makes perfect sense. Only you cavemen don't understand that.
very nice
Amazing to see this, kudos to all. Can you please also display the stats in kilometers ?
BULLSHIT and I have the proof ha.
Wow, a candle stick taking off with liar's, taking off from a FLAT EARTH!!!!! Space is fake, WAKE UP!!!!!!!!!
This is awesome!
It’s steam right?
Jeff Bezos just kicked Sir Richard's ass.
No footage from the cabin or windows..... Its just like 1980's nasa all over again. This is why SpaceX is still king, they show it all openly.
Where are ULA’s engines.
Why not putting also metric measurement for who are outside USA? I know to do a basic convertion but other people doesn't know...
where is the video recording in the cabin, why is it not released , it feels like something is missing
The Russians have long made such a flight with the Pepelatse of Danelia in Kin-dza-dza planet
I dunno sir, but it looks like a giant...
The dummies in here. They surely recorded things in the inside too, they are probably just waiting to release it, so as to let the actual crew enjoy that unique moment by themselves a little longer.
Jeffrey Bezos You did it!
А Рогозин пока песенки сочиняет
@1:12:40 Wally Push the Button
1:50:15 lmao that fart sound, even the girl laughed
congragulations=) i dont even have health for such jorney
TAX THE RICH. TAX THE RICH. TAX THE RICH. TAX THE RICH. TAX THE RICH. TAX THE RICH. TAX THE RICH. TAX THE RICH.
This is incredible! Hopefully I one day may be able to buy a ticket :D
That launch was beautiful…
even branson was SMART ENOUGH to put cameras and microphones in the cabin and outside the ship....amazingly stupid move bezos  whats cooler than going to space???? PAYING YOUR EMPLOYEES A LIVING WAGE LETTING YOUR EMPLOYEES TAKE BREAKS NOT BUSTING UNIONS EMPLOYEES TRY TO FORM  HOW ABOUT PAYING ANY ACTUAL TAXES?  eat the rich...
That was awesome! Young or old, let's go to space! Congratulations to everyone that made this flight possible.
Oliver Daeman is 17, not 18, why do they keep saying he’s 18?
Just pure awesomeness 🙌 way to go guys 👌🎓👓🔭
Гап йук 5 бохо фай фай фай
Returned to earth - Richest Word added to mankind..by billionaire s
FUCK BEZOS
too busy playing and floating they didn't even look out the windows
gilipolleces para ricos
That was the most awkward thing I have every watched. Wow. You would think as space tourism this would have been perfectly done. Speechless - but well done on the achievement
Well done 👍
So where are the internal videos like Branson had?
The worst sci-fi movie I have ever seen... Shameful!  No live camera inside the capsule, lots of cuts and camouflages, poorly done cgi... In the 60s they did better... Director Stanley Kubrick was missing!
28 million dollars for this?? I'll pass!!
Isn't that Oliver's dad? Such a lie. Didn't he say he was unable to be on the flight bc of his scheduling conflicts? Why is he there then?
من أتى من عند #مدونة_حوحو يضغظ ليك
Ну чего рогозины, самое время шутить.
2021 and no flight video from the cabin. What a lame launch lol.
Another billionaire in space using our savings and income. Federal fiat money printing at work, proof they get freshly printed money and 0% loans for their world conquest. Thanks for stealing our savings through inflation!!!
The saddest part about this was how some people actually believed it. Thankfully it was just a few. Am glad to be in college. Otherwise I would still believe the Moon landing happened. Thanks for your video!
Congratulations to Jeff Bezos and his entire team👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Exciting. But BO's livestream is the most disappointing of all the rocket launches. All that was given was laggy audio. Not a view of space and earth from the capsule. Its not like they cant fit a camera on the capsule. I get that this is commercial flight and want to keep privacy but at least show a moment of excitement in crews faces as they are in space, just a moment is fine. Just like how Virgin Galactic did. Show us the effects of zero G for a moment. Isn't watching this moment which will truly inspire the young generation about space exploration. But literally nothing is shown, Its like they are trying to say, commoners don't have to see this view which we can see. Its little things like this that make huge impact. This just made me respect companies like spacex, virgin galactic and rocket lab even more.
The fucking EGO of Jeff Bozo not to include any in-cabin footage. Pathetic! What's the point?
Wish I had the money to take one of these flights.  I'd buy a house with it.
Love from INDIA 🇮🇳 😍
With that ship design, Bezos seem like he is trying to compensate for something.
Sorry Jeff although legally the US government may recognize you as an “astronaut” public opinion says “just the tip” doesn’t count. Unless you circled the earth at least once you’re nothing more than a space tourist.
26:45 sus
That is called having faith in your technology. Job well done to all involved.
Congrats.  Honestly my favorite part is Wally Funk flying and reaching space, however briefly.
Great work to everyone working on this, we need competition. However watching this was kinda meh, was expecting them to actually go to space, maybe do an orbit and come back… nope… also lack of video of them reaching their height. I don’t know. You got a long way to go Blue Origin but good luck.
Hahahahaha what a pile BS- you’re being played - cgi
so we are the part of the history now 😱😝 20/07/2021 🍺
SUBORBITAL flight for rich people who cares...
Круто, умнички!
Trash ass camera quality
To far behind to truly catch up. First human flight? The Bezos mind... Sheesh!
Rivian?!?!???
Congrats
fake
Congratulations CGI ! CONGRATULATIONS!
*_Congratulations, Blue Origin!_*
did they actually enjoy time in space? being able to experience no gravity and enjoy the view for a while. seems so fast. was virgin up there longer? i’d like to see their experience.
Congratulations Mr. Bezos. Starting in a garage selling books online to flying to the edge of space. What a journey. Again, many CONGRATULATIONS!
The technician have touched the capsule before having it grounded. Howcome???
She had to wait from the 60’s till the 2020’s what a meme
:WARNING: Censorship of horizon views by both Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos flights above 340,000 ft altitude.  We must question their ethical behavior by this censorship and waste money/materials when we have greater needs here for the safe gUArding the sheeple here.  We can handle the TRUTH. SHOW US THE EARTH/GAIA!  WHY THE CENSORSHIP RICH GUYS?
WOW!!!!!
Wow! 우주 여행 성공을 축하합니다. 🥳
Oh cool, a new carnival ride just dropped
COME ON JEFF... GET EM!!!
meanwhile in the non upper class: google "flutkatastrophe deutschland"
BS AT ITS FINEST    SPEND ALL THAT MONEY AND NO CAMERAS INSIDE THE DICK?..FAKE AS BRANSON..
this is stupid, what a waste of money
Great but it feels like they are missing the oportunity to sell the experience. They need to think it trough, not just the safety which they solved. Make it look cool, suitable music, skip the boring people on the ground explaining stuff, show us lots of camera angles and good editing.
Excellent Flight! Congratulations Blue Origin Team on your achievement and successful transition to flying humans in space. Looking forward to your next flights and more developments in the future for your other flight equipment and platforms! Go Blue Origin! Go!
everybody in SpaceX headquarter "this our daily business, what is new ?"
What were they hiding? Blocked all the local roads beyond what had ever been blocked before for  other flights.  Not one camera in the capsule, not one image of them in space. For a guy who who had multiple cameras and studio lighting when he supposedly “surprised” his brother about the flight, he could not put one camera from Amazon in the capsule. Did they really go at all or was all the footage pre recorded? I think there was funny business going on here. Again .. WHY NO CAMERAS OF THE “ASTRONAUTS” IN SPACE. If they did go.. still very strange.
🛷
Do they not need to worry about fuel leaks after landing? It looks like they didn't even check for it
Too much taking during ascent
Lex Luthor finally made it to space
All the billions of pounds spent and 1:48:42 is the best we get??? Wheres the 8k uncut footage??
Congratulations!  Well done!!!
this is one giant flying dildo !
I enjoy watching and amazed..
$28 Million for 11 Minutes. Its expensive but for a billionaire hey...chimp change
The saddest broadcast of the launch. Where are the views from the ship? Where are the views inside the ship? What is mph? What is ft?
This is not a flight into space, but a mockery. Make at least one revolution around the Earth, then it will be a flight into space.
It's incredible! Science and engineering miracle.
It looks like a giant pecker.  X-D
That is very impressive, and also a bit sad to see all these great minds, efforts and investments that could be used to solve real problems
Virgin galactic to learn a thing or two from this broadcast
How racist.  No black people, no Indians, no asians, no arabs. How very racist.
Normally I applaud technological breakthroughs, great achievements. I totally support science advancing us forward. But in this case, for just a few minutes in "space", this just looks like a group of wealthy people lighting up a wheelbarrow full of $100 bills just to watch it burn. It's such a waste of money and resources. And most countries can't even afford vaccines. Way to earn respect Jeff...
Billionaires are going to space means they are not being taxed enough.
MEH you did something that was done 70 plus years ago. yall need to get up to date like SPACE X
Not impressed. Tell me when they go up and stay...forever. Then I might be impressed
Is obviously fake xd
I was happy and relieved all went smoothly. Congratulations to crew and all involved, great accomplishment.
This is not real, no one has been to space
Congratulations from Russia!
Congratulations!
Es una gran idea pero estaría bien que el momento también compartieran imágenes de las personas adentro de la capsula, para ver sus expresiones eso sería genial
great job amazing!!!!
I shed a happy tear
2 hours of broadcast to not be let into the capsule?!?!?  Waste of time.
Richard went through a semi flight ✈  But Jeff made it through a Rocket 🚀 (launching rocket is difficult than plane)
Congratulations to the crew...
If I was 18 and went to space?  I would definitely make a t-shirt asking women if they wanted to have sex with an astronaut.  I can see plenty of opportunities there.
Huge congratulations to Jeffery Bezos on burning a big pile of money to accomplish what NASA already did 60 years ago. We're supposed to "oohh and ahh" because some rich guy in the private sector went into space on stolen wealth. Maybe doing something useful with his billions, like paying his workers a fair wage and helping people in need here on earth instead of spending millions to go into space for 10 whole minutes? 🚀🚀
Wow hoooooo...??? I expected to be asked for my credit card number to make a purchase........... this isn't NASA....
What an experience to watch this live. It would even be awesome to get to see them in the capsule once they’re in space!
Flying space dildo.
One day shipping to space!
Look closeley at 1:45:25 engine doing copper burn in vacuum!!!
Not astronaut... space crew tourist.
The richest man in the world couldn't afford to put a $50 go pro in the best ride he's ever been on
The NASA astronauts speech made me thrill and really left me speechless 1:29:41
Amazing !!! History made today (7/20) Forever :-) Congrats for the tremendous Success !!! Applause.
Soon, there will be the most powerful spaceflight taking place all over the world. This space flight will be powered by the Spirit of God. I hope, you all and Jeff Bezos will be among us and ready for that day.  No Engin will be needed .The Spaceflight for all those who believe in Jesus-Christ and follow him. I am looking forward with great excitement to that day.   1 Thess 4: 17 Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
Freedom units -_
Too bad it didn't explode
you have to love holywood.
Funny how Amazon was the one who invested in Rivian, but Blue Origin is enjoying the electric pickups. Abusing his power just a little bit.
Hey guys does the booster really goes 2500 miles per hour when falling?
...Таки да...  А понтов-то, понтов...  Юрту-то откройте (главное в танке - не бздеть , ибо башню оторвет)!..  Шляп..  сними! И телки в "Стетсон" вокруг зеленого астронавта - сын банкира, как-ни-как...  Всякая невесткой хочет стать..  Уважение женщине-пилоту в почтенном возрасте, ее оптимизму.  И как всегда: наказание невиновных и награждение непричастных...  Жёржик?! А где же звездно-полосатый? Не патриотично, однако...
It is funny that the term "astronaut" being used so loosely lately.  This is not space exploration.  This and Galactic are nothing but a thrill club for ultra rich people.  If someone gets strapped onto a F1 car, can the person be considered as F1 driver?   Tax them to death with polluting the air.  This ultra rich people should be able to pay for the tax as well.  GO SPACEX GO
stream quality sucks, spacex does it better
She just called them astronauts
Congratulations and bodes well for commercial travel in 2022! What an experience the 2022-2023 ticket holders will be experiencing via licensing by the FAA, and support from our aerospace groups (US Space Force, Lockheed Martin). See, wikipedia, Blue Origin.   Jeff Bezos and his brother, we are sure, are absolutely delighted about their life and business decisions, and we were pleased to see the plans for the moon landing resumed ("one small step for mankind") with Mercury women coming through with Jeff Bezos!   Julie Ann Racino, Cornell and Syracuse University Alumni, 2022
Всё больше частных организаций стали летать в космос. Миллиардеры и владельцы корпораций интересуются космосом. Полёт в космос становится трендом, и это не может не радовать. Жаль, что мы в России всё просрали. Прости Юра :(
Time to get a new female announcer. Too much fake-sounding excitement. Blah blah blah.
No cabin video?
For a minute I thought Robinhood has created a rocket company - to pump the stocks. Lol your logo looks too much like Robinhood. Do you have footage of what people inside the capsule would see - always nice to see from the astronaut perspective?
Are you kiddin me.... I guess... I'll wait for a proper space flight... these feels like a teaser... no way I'm paying $250k for a roller coaster ride. Blue origin & virgin galactic are not exactly the type of space ride i have in mind... from the look of things... it looks like Virgin was more enjoyable... at least they got to float around.
Pretty cool but they are space tourists and not astronauts..
Фантастика!!!
2:13:40 music is very epic. I like it 🎶
It's not the first human flight. Space X already did the first one.
Seems like an amateur operation compared too their competitors. Still incredible and exciting for the future of space travel!
Bezos had balls to jump on this crap...
2:13:20 billion dollar champagne 🥂
No leather helmets?
Это начало новой эры космонавтики. Браво!
Congrats 👏
The richest man in the world couldn't afford to put a $50 go pro in the best ride he's ever been on
History was made today and we all witnessed it. On moon day 2021!
1:42:30
Totally Awesome Congratulations Blue Origin .... How far is Heaven ? ❤️🤞
Очередное никому ненужное шоу
I'm sure it's real b3cause it looks so f@k3!
2:01:29 back home 🏡
Awsome, congrats
How come every trip to so called space only has cameras that point straight down and both Blue Origin and Virgin never show the Earth when at the top of their flight? Branson's cut out early and Bezo's at 205000 feet shooting straight down the rocket. Just as terrible as Musk and his Tesla to Mars crap.
Теперь миллиардеры устали управлять миром и хаосом им тепепь космос подавай!
В ответ через два года российские космонавты полетят на Венеру
Russia sniffs in a rag, trampolines work.
1:54:42 astronaut bezos, best day ever 😂
Why no onboard video??
1:53:30 TOUCHDOWN 😋
looks fake.... the Beast and the False prophet cause wonders in the sky that deceive many
Lame filming.  Why didn’t you cut back to the camera in their ship?  The other problem is that it’s hard to get excited about this when the secret space program has antigravity tech like the TR-3B that they refuse to declassify and reveal to the world.  What you saw today is old tech.  It’s as if we were all getting excited watching a Model T move down the road.
it's a bird, it's a plane.. no it's a flying dildo
its really a considerable endeavor and accomplishment but... undisclosed price tag for a few min of glorified rollercoaster ride... with all the arrogance of Blue Origin and Bezos in particular (they would have you believe they were the very first to ever go into space), "making history" but no inside views (fuck you for that, BTW), annoying host and employees who start cheering when camera points at them i cant even like this video... sowwy.  again, congrats on making this achievement and finally launching someone to suborbital hop / space but yeah... it took you what, 20 years to get to this point? so see you in another 50 when you get to orbit? meh...   but still.. WHY NO FUCKING CABIN VIEWES??? Seriously, FUCK YOU FOR THAT!
Picture perfect ❤️well implementation
That's not the way to overcome the gravity of the earth with boosters, it's quite primitive to touch space in this way. People in 100 years will laugh at such approaches.  Forget about internal combustion engines. Because we do not understand gravity, we use such methods.
Please remove the midroll ads from the video. I have long been a proponent of more access to space and congratulations on a successful flight. That being said the marketing preflight material and YouTube midroll ads left a bad taste in my mouth for blue origin
so cool!
From #1001tech 🇩🇿
Emozione allo stato puro! Bellissimo!
Look how joyful the wealthy elites are. No idea that most of us are near suicidal and depressed, riddled with anxiety, with lives in shambles. Assholes, this is the very last thing society needs right now. All of you who pay for Amazon prime like lemmings, I hope your God gratifies you.
Awesome!
Hope, I could see that in an Amusement park soon... :)
I am going to puke....who cares about the rich man's adventures.
Good job👍
Hi
Wow ! Amazing 😍👍 Peace on your way to you and all who are reading this 🙏
They should try a space walk for a minute next time.
2:04:38 OOPSIES
looks like my second mission in the Kerbal Space Program (first one exploded)
I'm the only one to think that SpaceX has the best Marketing team of all private space companies?
Еврогомосятина отстала лет на 60,и радуются дурачки....Скудные духом и разумом, жалко вас....
They all had personal dildos to go with the intergalactic dildo. X rated. Youtube would purge.
Jeff Bezos is a criminal because he is collaborating with the criminal US Army. The US military is killing children and women in Yemen.
Kissy Jeff ( Besos ) flies his dildo to outer spaaaaaaace!
Congrats to the entire team who made that flight possible. I cant wait to see how these technologies are refined and perfected over the next decade. Perhaps one day I'll book a ticket on one of these rockets. I have been fascinated with space and sci fi stuff my entire life and now I can see a possibility for me to go to space for myself. With Blue Origin, SpaceX, Virgin and others it is looking like the cost of space is coming down and will actually be possible for citizens to get into space. What a great day. Keep it up
Amazing progress, on behalf of all humanity, congratulations Jeff.
Maybe Rachel Nichols can take this main broadcaster's job...cringe
Is it just me or does the videos look like CGI.
Can we say that you're not astronauts.
Amazon shoppers and workers unite!!!!! Lol seriously that was cool though.
nice vanity mission
Молодцы!
Commentary lady was super ANNOYING!!!! Just let us watch the rocket without her stumbling over her words, "Ohhhh ummmm amazing"
Those touch downs were awesome!
Вернулся таки на бренную землю...
1:54:00 the dummy is not even moving his head. How fake lmao
Pls share spacewalk video
Guys pls what's the music at the beggining?
Yeah that's a penis....a flying one lol
50 miles isnt really space... well sure NASA considers it the boundary for space, but the rest of the world does not. 100km is a more appropriate boundary.
SpaceX : seen
The host is horrible,  and the camera locations are amateur hour..... so bad.
From none, to three human-rated spacecraft launching from the US, over the last two years, Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic and SpaceX have ALL achieved a giant leap forward over the old guard of the Military Industrial Space Flight companies. Sure, two are sub-orbital, but they've still carried people further then the Starliner, and all three systems have flown more times then the Starliner. It's time to say 'well done', to all three Commercial spaceflight companies.
Thats a ... thats a....
So after 20 years Blue Origin manages to send people not into orbit and we couldn't even see a cabin view?
Elon Musk now be like hurry up team I'll be the first one to go to Mars...
What a day in the history!!!
Astronaut Wally Funk is my spirit animal!
At 01:43:20 or precisely 9 seconds after takeoff, that 10 second aerial shot looks fake. I'm not calling foul on the flight itself, but wouldn't put it past them to fabricate some nice coverage for the event.
Wonder is the Amazon workers got a pee break & got to watch this flight during JB little extravaganza?
I would prefer the Virgin Atlantic flight to space and  this is also very impressive 😊
Hey look at me I'm a billionaire that would rather spend billions on my own amusement park ride than a living wage for my employees.
A true waste of money, homeless people and many are starving.  Shame on you Besos.
Too bad Bezos had a successful flight. Such a tragedy for mankind...
Oh crap. He has survived. What a shame.
So happy for Wally Funk. Good move flying her to space.  One day, maybe she will get to ride to orbit... currently only available from... well... the "other" spaceflight company.  It would be cool if she could ride all 3 current human rated American spacecraft.
So much nerdiness
if I have money, that's what I do. Congratulations to Jeff for the dream realized.
One of the only guys I've ever seen look kool in a cowboy hat.
คนไทยมารวมกันตรงนี้
So proud as a human being, future has come
Amazing but the cameraman is lousy while the rocket was going up
Do they serve peanuts during the flight?
what a waste, a tourist event and expensive too. does not contribute in any way to space research.  then look at Elon Musk, who builds real spacecraft. and its mission is the exploration of space.
I thought they were gonna go up higher
They actually had the best camera quality of the three opponents
The launch audio is INSANE
Wheres everyones masks and “social distancing” oh wait the billionaires don’t have to follow the rules
It is so great for a 1 billion people in the world. This is the prioritets of the happy billion in the world
so they were up there for like 10 sec? cool touchdown though
So it landed as well. Now all the Musk fanboys can finally shut up and we can enjoy progression on two sites.
loved
FANTASTIC!!!!!!
The fact that they kept filming from the ground proofs that this does not count as space
Since I was a young boy I have always dreamed of going to space and beyond.  Watching this has transported me from 40 back to that young boy again!  I hope to one day be able to afford that dream!  Thanks again to Jeff, his team, and all others who are making space travel possible for all generations!  LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!!!
Wow sooo natural.👏👏👏
Not much "diversity" in that group, eh? lol
How strange no black on board.
Пояснительная бригада: разве не должна капсула хоть немного обуглиться при прохождении через атмосферу???  И почему тело в окне так похоже на манекен???
Horray! A happy ending for the rich people!
glad that they made it back safely. It didn't seem like they were up there long enough to experience much weightlessness. Did they get a chance to at least float around in the capsule?
It would have been amazing to be able to see them inside the capsule and the whole way up and see there reactions.
Excellent, congrats! 😊😊😊👍👍👍
Watching this reminded me of how high the stream quality standards are for SpaceX compared to others
The "first human flight" propaganda is pretty pathetic.
Amazing to watch  Passengers/Astronauts and crew helpers CLIMBING UP the stairs !
vapourware
Nothing interesting, Branson more coolest.
Host is more excited than the crew. Feels like she travelled.
yay, the flying penis ship ... LOL
⏩to 1:40:00 w/ West Texas Panoramic view & Launch @ T-3:00 🇺🇸🇨🇱
A bit funny ) Looks like a cowboy going to space 🤠 Congrats with pushing the limits
Congrats to the whole Team who worked behind the screen
Jeff Bezos, what about the horizon? Could you show for all jf us the video from the board? And why Blue Origin Live do not like comments? Фейконавты Хреновы ))
virgin galactic looks more passenger friendly being able to fly & land like a plane
I appreciate it but Virgin Galactic is more impressive
Congratulations Mr. Bezos!!!
Gary was giving nothing to Ariane in that broadcast 😅
Хорошая работа 👏
If Bozos and Branson had gone to weightless space there would have been no apogee just continuous travel into outer space! These are no different than the weightlessness of the Vomit Comet airplane!  They are just falling at the same rate of gravity, but who has any use for the truth anymore....Look up escape velocity.
Congratulations 🇺🇲🚀
No Camera inside to see the crew? And when it landed the Guy in the window was not moving at all then they would pan to another camera? Interesting . If he did go to space glad we paid for it all.
Congratulations, Wally! Kudos to Bezos for creating opportunity to allow NASA astronauts to fulfill their life dream!
I guess Blue Origin was the best name ... would have been awkward to name the company Amazon Space Services (A.S.S.)
Wow.. what a record too.. very accurate VERTICAL LANDING on GROUND ! of both, the booster rocket and Passenger crew... so smooth ! USA has done it again ! -Today History remade.. recollecting on 20thJuly1969, Americans set foot on Moon, First time in History of Mankind !
it doesnt look impressive ngl. The one from virgin galactic looks neater.
WELL DONE! @Blue Origin Thank you, Mr. Bezos!
my heart is so full. Wally brought women from all over the world up there with her and every person that took flight today <3 THANKFUL TO BE ALIVE TODAY! 7/20/21 will forever be the day that changed our universe forever. Thank You, Blue Origin team!
Too many people/media etc  around the craft after the landing. Why do I see this becoming some kind of media madness where people end up doing stupid things because they are allowed near the craft after the landing.
A hoax
They didn't have video because Spielberg backed out at the last minute -- not wanting his legacy to be undone by this hoax like Stanley Kubrick.
Congratulations.
1:42:34 to skip to launch
somebody needs to offer capcom Sarah Knight a spokes person job!
Jeff "Just The Tip" Bezos
After watching this and the one of Richard Branson, I would say Richard Branson is a way better businessman.
Congratulations to the Blue Origin team and the Astronauts.. A job well done 👏👏❤
More like suborbital-nauts than astronauts.
I thought the launch was interesting, you can see the variable throttle in action.
The outstanding character of the flight was Wally Funk. Could hear her whoops of joy during the flight. Thank you Wally Funk for sharing your flight with us all.
As a non-american the one thing that annoys me is the use of imperial units on international broadcast. Instead of 350 000ft use 106km, much less confusing. Same for the speed. Most use people don't use miles, feel etc. Just put it there as secondary scale if you must show imperial as well.
First, IT’S NOT FIRST HUMAN FLIGHT. Branson flew first. Second, why you did not record a video of the cabin? 🤔 Branson experience was much better and trustable.
Launch at 1:43:00
Молодцы! Примите поздравления! Пройдет еще 50 лет и такое путешествие будет не сложнее, чем полет на море и заслуга в этом, в том числе и ваша.
Wow, people losing their shit over something humans have been doing for 60 years. Good job bezos on diluting the meaning of astronaut
Elon Musk unilke this video.
Am I the only one that finds Jeff Bezos going to space absolutely terrifying? lol
Still got to do a lot of work to reach the play level as SpaceX is. Keep it up.
Was that it?
"astronaut bezos"
Very nice!. But what a waste of money!
Thats it?? If it was my money I'd be so underwhelmed and insist to get a refund.
This is amazing
that was not a spaceflight. Karma will hit you some day! :D
Congrat 😍😘
Where is the capsule internal footages?
A big tip of the hat and loud "KUDOS!" to Jeff Bezos and the Blue Origin team for making this happen!  From a lifelong NASA fan since the early 1960s, exciting times, for sure....  Also have to mention an unsung hero who was aboard the flight, Wally Funk, a member of of the 'Mercury 13' Women in Space Program in the early 1960s.  If you wanna just skip to the actual launch, go to about 1:42:40 in the video.
Blue origin 💙💙💙
The virgin' lives was best!
LOL, fake..
Люди - в космосі! Надзвичайне стало звичайним! Вітаємо! Дякуємо дуже!
Congratulations!!!
again.... not astronauts! and not even crew.  they are passengers on overpriced suborbital roller-coaster. get your names right
Space is sick! Any hippy's saying otherwise can suck it!
Could of sworn I heard Bezos said keep buying amazon suckas  I'm rich bitch!!  I swear I heard that
Да, это история!
Meh.
я правильно услышал  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMHhXzpwupU&t=6531s Всем привет!  ?))
Man, that was awesome. But I want to see cabin VIDEO so bad!!! Hopefully it was collected and will be released at some point. Half of the experience is feeling the thrust of the rocket beneath you - we need to see it!
Hahaha the most fake landing ever seen! Ever ever lol
Where is the inside video of the rocket capsule?
Congratulations! It`s amazing! <3
Only people who have $$$ can go into that flight Blue Origin.   The poor people still try to survive on this earth.
Представляете сколько народа трудилось как рабы в его Амазоне с 2000х что бы эти миллиардеры слетали разок?! Это очень круто!! Поздравляю!)))
https://youtu.be/lc51BgjRkAs
https://youtu.be/VMIHbqlsX6Q
So Great this moment has Finally arrived! Yeah!!! Congratulations to every single Team Member of Blue Origin who gave every effort to make this Crewed Flight a Reality!!! Jeff you could not have chosen a better unsung hero to fly with you with Walli Funk! WOW!!! GREAT Work EVERY"ONE
Congratulations Jeff
Disabling stream, no video from the space or cabin. It's kind of shameful to keep people waited to see something different. Virgin Galactic was way more superior from this aspect. Boring video honestly.
I see those crew transport cars are Rivian's!
Olivier ❤️❤️ je hebt het gewoon gedaan!  Kan niet wachten om jou verhaal over de ervaring te horen!  Blue origin; amazing way of take “us” aboard, loved The way everything was shared with us on planet earth 😉
Did they happen to mention how much freefall time they got? Were they able to unstrap and float around, or did they all remain strapped in for the entire flight?
a small flight for a men, but a great flight for humanity. Dreams comes true.
I am disgusted by how superficial humanity has become. We are celebrating this useless rich guy flexing without any real purpose or usefulness, when 52 years ago we went to the moon? SpaceX does something that is commercially viable and useful as well while being revolutionary, but Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic is just a joke. The X-15 did the same thing back in 1959.
Looks fake as shit just like the crap NASA has been feeding us for decades.
engine works not so smooth on throttling. also kind of a long ramp up even for h2 engine
No face masks?? Hmmm not good!! 😎🙈🙏
Яхуею_дорогая редакция!!!!
Yeah Fucking Fun!
We need a better live host 🤦🏻‍♂️
lame
Congrats to everyone.  I bet this inflated Jeff bezos ego more than it was already.  This doesn’t mean NASA is giving him the contract on a flying sexual toy.
Why no video from inside the capsule ????
1:52:55 where is the cushion that he is talking about?
Uau! Nice
Most excited for the kid❤️
Unreal yes I agree ☝🏼
Fantastic Flight  - well done to you all - wish I had a seat on it!
대박
over 50 years ago we supposedly sent men to the moon.  yet today we are freaking out over a minute flight into the edge of space?   shouldn't flying to other planets be a new normal by now?   "first human flight"? whatever.
I Love you Wally Funk.   She is the super Grandmother
👍✊
Anyone wondering why there wasn't a camera inside? I heard they ordered it off Amazon and it showed up late and broken....oh well. Must have ordered the voice recorder from Wish. That worked, at least.
Amazing, but you would imagine someone would have been spent $$$$ on some professional recording of the event. The camerawork was not great of the rocket for such an important event..
Just watched the main event.  Still an overblown commercial.
That was quick. Most rollercoaster rides take longer than this!
75 tons of CO2 in 10 minutes. A random citizen of the world doesn't make that amount in one life...  I wish that Jeff Bezos next challenge is to help our planet to not get destroyed by the global warming.
first 60 mins are Pure Company Propaganda Force fed with nationalism 😂😂🤷‍♂️
You did it! Congratulations!
1:42:30 is where the real action starts!
Congratulation, we are back to square one. The first flight of Allen Shepard in 1961 was better. This looked like an expensive joke.  Mr. Amazon can afford it.
"Astronauts"?  Meat in a can.
😩🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻
Так ведь проще полесть в политику и обворовывать народ как делают в Украине. А он какие то там полёт в космос разрабатует.
crew member inside doesn't move at all. no motion. a mannequin? well it's subborbital, orbit is for humans
Hah, 1:55:29 - "can you say that in meters" :D
How ironic would it be if Jeff Bezos needed to tinkle really badly during those 10 minutes from the excitement and the only method of relief would be a plastic bottle.
Why do I feel that Elon could have done that 4yrs ago..
Oo ye
1:43:11 liftoff
Maravilha!!! Parabéns!!!
Wasn't that landing too hard? Anyone else noticed.
I don't really like Jeff bezos, but getting wally funk to go to space was really cool
Rich man and his toy yo yo. Rather anti climatic without achieving orbit, sorry. Karman line is just some arbitrary attempt to delineate the edge of space. Without achieving orbit this is just a recreation of something that was achieve 60 years ago. Excuse me if I'm not impressed while you pat yourselves on the back.
My lord yea these are not astronauts ha. Just hollering amateur billionaires. Now the engineers, THEY are the badasses here
Please, for the next cast,,, anyone but Ariane Cornell.
Altitude in feet?  Velocity in MPH? WTF?  2021 *yes - I checked*
How come  Grandma Wally at 83 has more energy than me am 24 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Felicidades!
" ... to see the glow of the engines ..." breathlessly bad commentary ... not as bad as the Virgin shot mind you ...
Find another Narrator she is tapping my last nerve !!! It's a damn rocket not USS 1701 !!! How does it feel to be the last one to the party...
Sembra un grosso cazzo
Ummmmm....I think I would rather use Virgin Glactic. The landing looks painful and you can't unbuckle to experience zero gravity???
WTF!
Why would someone pay 250k USD for a 10 minute flight 100km straight up?
RSS 😁😁
The live commentary sucks.
Amazing :) But in my opinion it should be called the Blue Pill, or something like that ... :) Its shape resembles a dildo: P :)
That's an impressive elevator 😊
Superb launch and landing of astronauts.
Why is no one talking 'bout the design already?
Please stop saying they went to space, they didn't, they went really high up yes, but not space... Also, curvature of the earth was non-present? Just like the Virgin cam? Round-earthers, don't shoot someone who's observant 👍🏻
just for the fact they don't use metric system I disliked the video
Parabéns belo feito
Wait wait let me skip the Zomato ad 1st
В полете вообще на xер похож  или на дилдо)
Очередной батут заработал!!!
So that's where my 7.99 Amazon subscription goes. Ok Jeff.
Congratulations Mr. Bezos, you have proven the possibility of remote delivery anywhere on planet earth. His investment can help and transform the lives of many people around the world with a speed never before experienced.
🚀Congratulations!!!🚀
my god you people are stupid and will buy anything
No video in the cabin...That's wack....big Windows and no video of the crew floating and what they saw, still successful thou
How about next time, instead of a sending the richest man in the world, you send 1 or 2 lucky average joe contestants into space. It's a much better look. Great work, nonetheless, Blue Origin.
Jeff bejoj  NoOBDA 😇😇☺🙂😗😍😍😍😗
Its like flying to the same airport you depard from, totaly useless.  If you can fly to the space station than you have a  destination to fly to.  And do we (humans) still have to burn something to travel big distances .
It looks like a giant willy.
Wally was like "What?". So funny.
It's awesome how the moderating women can keep talking and talking and talking...  Incredible
So in true Amazon fashion they only had Alexa and no video in the cockpit 😆
Tfw you cant reach orbit
Well, actually they're not astronaut. To be an astronaut, you need to do a full circle around the Earth too. But they're great anyway.
Looks like a far better experience than Virgin Galactic.
Ok, the flight was on Texas, but why the fuck Jeff have to wear a cowboy hat?
You guys are not astronauts. You are PASSENGERS.  You guys are also not crew. You are PASSENGERS.
Good stuff, well done Blue Origin.
what a waste of time, money and energy. go to the fucking moon already....
Fake
Really important step for mankind ..while children continue to needlessly die of starvation.
Amazing! Awesome! Congrats to all Blue Origin people!!! Great Job!!! Keep flying!
maybe the most expensive 10min. in life ;-)
God damn it, Jeffrey survived.
The best part was at 1:58:52 when Gary encounters the most akward moment of his life!
Good job, on a side note though - you've gotta change that logo. It's meaningless in it's current form and could represent anything - a pillow making company or writers' association for instance.
It's cool and everything, but all this millions and effort to be in space for less than 5 minutes... idk if it is worth it
this event makes me remember the moon landing in 1969,  Apollo 11 when I was 6 years old. Congratulations today is a new step on space journeys one day the stark trek will be true.
Congrats Blue Origin and fuck the salty Spacex fanboys
1:50:09 the sound of the twin sonic booms sounded so beautiful
Damn, shes irritating!!
To make us unwashed masses feel better, they were in space for a couple minutes. Its rlly not that great.
Absolutely amazing to see that boost land
Come on we all wanted to see the cabin view.. ! That'd be more fun.
SpaceX #1
Молодцы! Рад за них! :)
The super mega rich plan to build sky cities and leave the rest of us to live down here in the dust and rubble.
Nice intro, great flight but no shots from inside the capsule?
Mandaron una chota al espacio! Que grande el Jeff!!
Congrats guys!!! Still, this looks scarier than taking off with a plane 😅 Why no interior views?
Горжусь американцами, их трудолюбием и стремление к мечте. Безос, Маск, Бренсон - вот пример настоящих предпринимателей. Стыдно за Россию, Роскосмос и наши утерянные надежды. Юра, мы всё проебали.
Круто! Красиво! Технологично!
I am incredibly happy to witness how people make history.  FIRST (COMMERCIAL) HUMAN FLIGHT INTO SPACE.  It's incredible.  I congratulate all those who worked on this and who showed us that a person can conquer the vastness of the universe if he wishes and has the opportunity.
Does someone see white UFO ?  T+ 05:42
Congratulations to Jeff Bezos, the entire Blue Origin team and all space lovers on a successful first historical, travel, New Shepard space flight, NS-16 mission, and a safe return home to Earth! Jeff Bezos opened a new era of space travel, now space has become even closer to people! 🌎🚀👍⭐️👏
MPH and FT? How quaint!
How did that 18yo kid get on? Rich parents maybe?
#Congratulations Blue Origin for Your First Flight.  After All, You Entered into the Race.
Are they gonna upload some good iphone photos cause the camera looking down the the space craft is junk
Congrats. Now pay your taxes Jeff.
CONGRATULATIONS JEFF BEZOS!!! VERY IMPRESSIVE !! THANK YOU!!  DREAM WILL COME TRUE!!
Oliver welcome back. Amazing flight! Groetjes uit Nederland!
Congratulations 🎊🎊👏
Why does everything look like CGI today? I know it can't be CGI but it really looks fake in some moments, such as booster touch down 1:50:18
Why would they not put cameras in the cabin
No videos from inside🤔
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 love how people think its real.
So beautiful to watch..
Doesn't compare to virgin galactic at all
Слава Україні!
Amazing. Thank you to all the engineers.
There fake astronaut
This is so fake they didn't even get off there seet
So did this thing boost back to earth with rocket fuel in order to hit 2600mph descent speeds?
Sorry, no matter how hard 'Blue Origin' tries, they will never come close to SpaceX...
Wow! Amaizing!
Great photography, but why do we have to listen to motor-mouth drivel throughout the whole thing?  I would also suggest that the Title 'Astronaut' is reserved for people who actually work in space, 'Space Tourist' is quite sufficient for these four.  But the photography was really good, love the way that thing sits on it's pad, and even the capsule landing is brilliant engineering.
Wkońcu... wow brawo
It's coming soon to the amusement park near you 🚀😎🚀
Esta es la división B de los vuelos al espacio.. Space X  juega en la Premier League.
WTF I WAS THINKING THEY WERE GOING TO SPACE 🙄🙄 BUT CONGRATULATIONS FOR THEY SUCCESFUL LAUNCH.....🙃
CEO, entrepreneur Born in 1964 Jeffrey, Jeffrey Bezos
I don't mind this but what exactly have they achieved that is original or new tech? Also, Calling these "rich self loading cargo" astronauts really does belittle the Armstrong, Glenn, Gargarins of the world.
The earth Is flat and the Moon a electromagnetic plasma projection! Bezos say
Which U2 song is played at the beginning of the broadcast? does anyone know?
Very nice 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👏👏👏
Very impressive but gosh blue origin learn from everyone else and put some more cams on that thing
Wow that's a big peni.......rocket
if you want to take a look, I made a small video summary of the successes of Blue Origin 💙
congratulations - everything worked out super smoothly... but i still don't understand why you are doing this? just to earn money with it later? what is the goal for the future (earth, science, humanity...) with such up and down trips for billionaires?
LOOK TO THE FUTURE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNJv-GItC5g&t
The space race has begun. Kudos to virgin galactic and Blue origion to make it possible for the rest of us to take the journey
👏👍...¡ wow... Congratulations...👍👍👏👏...
Why no footage from the capsule?  I find that to be very interesting.  This big windows and zero film from inside.  Why not just wear a Gopro?
FAKE AF
Congrats Blue Origin and all the "Astronauts"! 🙂
молодці!
good job jeff
Congratulations! waiting for the inside capsule video.
Prometheus
u using ft and mph??? fuck u jeff
I did not like it, there is no that grace and beauty, as it was in the flight of the Virgin This is especially noticeable on landing, some kind of fuss, people are installing a poor ladder etc.
Ммм хуета
KSP space music should start played, when they passed Karman line
SO GREAT! GRATULATONS FROM GERMANY!
It's so amazing to see what humanity has accomplished coming from nothing. Congrats!
She didn't really say "light that candle"
Every time I hear the word astronaut here in this context, I cringe... In my view the title 'astronaut' is misused here, and will be abused and become meaningless in the not so distant future. For me, astronauts are professionals who work and live on orbit. People who go to space or deep space with a mission, to conduct science or other valuable work in support of that. These people have dedicated much of their lives to this profession, had countless years of study and training, and do things that only a relatively small group of incredibly skilled people in the world can do. This New Shepard launch is just another quick hop out of the atmosphere and back. Calling people on such a flight - who generally have more money than one can possibly spend on useful things in one lifetime - astronauts is just a huge undervaluation of this title. 'Space tourist' would me a more appropriate designation, since this is space tourism business after all. People nagging about how 'astronaut' isn't an official title or something, I'm just saying that it should be, and only in a professional fashion. More and more untrained tourists will go to space in the future, will millions of people then become astronauts? Not a meaningful and distinctive title, or is it? If you ask me, there should come a clear distinction between professional space travelers or astronauts (people who go to the ISS and conduct science and maintenance) and tourists or hobbyists who pay big money for their own story of a lifetime.
Wait one G = 22mph so that granny was tolerating almost 100Gs???!!!  at 1:45:20 the rocket was going 2226 mph
Бабка жива?
I just love astronomy and space flight. Thanks Jeff Bezos!
Just the tip space.  Just the tip
What an amazing achievement to become the youngest astronaut ever! Everyone can do it. You don't have to be particularly intelligent or skilled, you don't need to pursue a career in science, you don't have to work for it at all. You only need an ultra rich dad who pays the $19M for the ticket! Congratulations!
This flight was dumb as compared to virgin
I’d much rather have the money go toward fair taxes. NASA did all this and more decades ago and the results benefits us all unlike this circus. No wonder the dirty journalists love this waste.
Great flight. Wish that woman announcing would stop with the heavy breathing orgasms at every turn.
Amazing!!!
"Astronauts". Hohoho. I'm happy for Wally and all, but that's like saying a person dressed up in scuba gear but can't work a regulator or understand dive tables, is an ocean diver just because they fell into the water and climbed back into the boat.   This is an autonomous cargo-launching mission, plain and simple. All the same, congratulations to the teams involved at Blue Origin. You gang did good today.
Hope they release cabin footage 👍❤️🇦🇺🎉
Well , it's just the most expensive roller coaster ride ever built.....
Another toy for selfish rich people to flaunt in the faces of the working class.
Can we please stop with the astronaut nonsense? Flying in that thing doesn't make you an astronaut any more than flying in an airliner makes you a pilot.
It was amazing Great work Team Blue Origin
Rogozin Trampoline Space Crew, will come soon
Virgin galactic's spaceflight was way more cool than this one .What did we get to see here ? A big di*k flying? Isn't that common ? We get to see them quite often🙂
миллиарды в никуда,хоть бы пару витков вокруг земли,лучше уж на батуте чем так
Hopefully he’ll stay up there.
Why were the astronauts without spacesuits? what if there was a depressurization of the cabin?
How could this be that boring?
How can you do a first human flight event and not include video from the cabin? Any explanations why there is no camera in the cabin? I mean we are in 2021, look at what SpaceX does for all it's flights ..
Why do I know SpaceX will win this space race? Because they use the metric system.
I had to mute this commentator.
Nothing was invented ... it's only a new business for Bezos. thank you for saving the planet...
Would have been perfect with telemetry in metric. Seriously, you can't mock another company for choosing space at 50 miles and then use feet to express the altitude of a rocket and mph for its speed.
Wow what a drama created lol no view from capsule ? Best ever Sci- fic drama created by Jeff and team ! Jeff be like who will see after Amazon , I will only come out of capsule which is on the land 😂
Wowieee itz wonderful 👏 ❤ 💖 ♥ 😍 ✨
Very good. Glad they're safely back. At the end of the day, though it's  really just a theme park ride.
Oliver is gonna get sooooo much poon, it'll be out of this world (;
редкостная херня
Everyone please stop fighting... Google already calls them *Commercial Astronauts*
No camera on inside capsule. Worst experience to watch.
This is not going to space 🤣
I am one of the elon and SpaceX fans，And now I am also one of the  blue origin fans
grats but 200k or so for 3minutes of space seems so expensive and just a taste lol
It was Amazing !
Looked fake as shit to me.
First Human Flight. All flights before are HOAX!
Loved the broadcast but the host is the most annoying person ever to listen to!!
52:46 "Recorded Earlier" Yeah sure, Wally Funk is a time traveller lol.
Big congratulations 🎊
Such a beautiful sight. Thank you, Jeff.
Круть!! 👍
Jeff, great job man!! Congratulations 👍👍
It's fake! 8.2 km is the border of death without an oxygen mask: even a healthy and trained person can lose consciousness and die at any time. Where are the overload protective suits, where is the oxygen equipment?
honored to be with you online. Congrats to all of Team blue👍
though doth wahoo too much
Watch out for all those triggered flat earthers.
Your video disappointed me deeply. Instead of the horizon at an altitude of 100 kilometers, you again showed some kind of fake vision. I was not interested in the ship's ass and the dust from under the descent module. Tell me, please, for what needs there are such large windows through which we saw nothing? The earth is flat, isn't it? ))
I don't like the use of the word "astronauts" in this instance.  They are passengers.  This is a great achievement, yes.  I just think that the word astronaut should be reserved for a professional pilot, or mission specialist, or scientific mission.
Need to get some outer space real bad?? Gotta bad case of Blue Bezos ^ : 0
Илон Маск сделает лучше 😎
Flat earthers: oh, f*ck!
Too much noise for nothing! Overrated events, same with Virgin Galactic!
That's one giant leap for a man, but one small step for mankind.
new level of entertainment
"It just feels different." Yeah, you can say that again. I bet this is the most people in history to hope for something bad to happen all at one time.
outstanding big love from INDIAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Да уж.. Ну и космос..Полёт на воздушном шаре... А как же огонь, горящего шара, через атмосферу, как космонавты возвращаются наши.
What an accomplishment, great job guys!!!!! <3
Bezos as well as Branson did not reach space, space begins at an altitude of 118 km. this was established using the STII (Super - Thermal Ion Imager) instrument, which was launched into orbit. With his help, it was found that the boundary between the atmosphere and space is located at an altitude of 118 kilometers above sea level.
Made in Algeria 🇩🇿💪
Even after this successful historic mission.  The architect Gary Lai( anchor ) is like : "Ahhhh, that's my job. Had to do it"  Cmon Gary, enjoy man, champagne🍾 Loved it.
comentator was a bit cringe
Cioè ci state dicendo che nel 2021 in un evento del genere  non esiste manco una telecamera che riprende in diretta il panorama mozzafiato a bordo del razzo? mille inquadrature a bordo di droni che riprendono in maniera impeccabile ma nenache un inquadratura da lassu? solo un inquadratura fissa del razzo che scompare fino a diventare un effetto boke. Con tutti i soldi spesi  per l impresa eroica direi che è ridicolo.
Blue Origin never heard about a metric system
Welcome back Jeff and Crew 🚀 Best Wishes from Hong Kong 💝🛸
Perfect delivery by Amazon, uh, i meant Blue Origin. ;-)) Greetings from Germany!
Nice, unnecessary carbon emissions.
The fastest vibrator in history.
большие молодцы!
Congratulations Blue Origin!
Congratulations Blue Origin Team 🎉 and Welcome back all crew members 😀
Congratulations!!! 👍
I was hoping the chutes wouldn't deploy,! Bring on the hate now!
So if I win the lottery I'll book a ride on this.
so..was that it? fly up and than drop back down? how long did they stay up there? couple seconds? Nice launch but seems awful experience.
When it takes off and lands like an airplane perhaps. No desire to spew my guts.
www.neevn.in and www.fireya.co.in as well as www.2earth.space needs partners and cofounders
This is the begging of a new era to humanity and I will be part of it too!!! Hugs from São Paulo Brazil to all friends in world!!🇧🇷🇪🇺🇺🇸🇯🇵🇨🇦
That was amazing! Welcome Back Jeff! RICHEST PERSON OF THE UNIVERSE WELCOME BACK!
Maybe Elon Musk could hook you up with some Starlink so you can give us video from inside the cabin next time?
who was the genius that decided to put the camera on the ground instead of in the rocket?
Тот момент когда 80 летняя бабка в США выглядит лучше и бодрее чем многие 40 летние женщины в РФ))
I’m only glad that Wally Funk and the 18-yr old are okay.
Why wasn’t there any filming in the cabin? The boosters view were pretty good but I would’ve def liked to see the crews reaction.
CEO, entrepreneur Born in 1964 Jeffrey Jeffrey Bezos CEO, entrepreneur Born in 1964 Jeffrey Jeffrey Bezos Come on, Jeffrey, you can do it Pave the way, put your back into it Tell us why, show us how Look at where you came from, look at you now Zuckerberg and Gates and Buffet Amateurs, can fucking suck it Fuck their wives, drink their blood Come on, Jeff, get 'em! AAAAH!
Jeffrey Bezos flew on new shepard rocket and capsule with his brother Mark Bezos, Wally Funk, and the first paying space tourist Oliver daemen!! Jeffrey Bezos and Mark Bezos are the best brothers on earth!!!
Congrats, well done! But - calling a passenger in a space capsule on a parabolic trajectory an astronaut is a bit like calling a flight passenger a pilot... to me it seems this was more about marketing than space flight. Nevertheless, I respect the excellent engineering and flight operations.
I came to watch Wally and the HUGE smile on her face as she was floating around in space...🤔 so where was the video inside the capsule?? I don't know if announcer lady said anything about it because frankly she was ruining the moment TBH so I muted it and played classic rock instead while I watched. I'd understand if someone was getting a little nervous sick or even if that was the reason for the hold, having trouble getting the video but no one behind the desk could explain that one either.  I'm trying to give benifet of the doubt so until we know for sure, boooo! for no video..HUGE disappointment.
Congratulations!
jeff
Unbelievable. Fantastic. Just beyond perception. Congrats from Lituania!!!!!
1:55:39 can you say this in meters? best part
ELON MUSK IS THE BEST. SPACEX FOR THE WIN. 💪🏻
How do you call that a success !! After the amount of absurdity compared to the crowding that he settled before the launch
All amazon's army of trolls pretending to be excited while no one gives gives a f@ck.
Was that suborbital? Welcome to the 1960's Mr. Bezos.
The beginning of space tourism goes to blue origin and perfect flight new shepard rocket and capsule!! Well done Jeffrey Bezos!!
Pretty bold for the guy in glasses to say that they can land New Glenn's booster on the very first try. Even SpaceX's Falcon 9, which is smaller than New Glenn, took multiple tries for it to land successfully. Actual real world conditions is much much different than computer simulations
Нужно безвозвратно отправить одного человека. Скидываемся все Беларусью.
Let's be honest, that was a space dildo
Вперед, Америка! Привет Рогозину.
Wow! Hats off to all the engineers & staff specially the main architect "Gary". The live feed was on time, great host, nice cam angles from start to end. Though, I wish there were live cam feeds from the capsule itself during ascent.
Congratulations to all involved in the launch and in the coverage. I just wish you had thought about us international viewers, providing speed and altitude information in international units. It was amazing, though.
Thank You Mr.Jeff Bezos
Remember when some guy from Australia or Africa sent his electric car into space and then astronauts to the space station?  Well, Blue Origin still has a long way to match the guy with the funny accent🥴
Congrats
Marginally more interesting than the past 15ish launches. Highlight was the blonde lady in the white dress with the creme coloured cowboy hat (in the crowd after they landed). Anyone know who that was? PS: BO seriously, for the 500th time, please add metric units to the telemetry. Oh and try including video from the cabin so it's not sooooo boring to watch.
Now that you pass this challenge gift 1 billion dollars more to poor people
Bilionaires and their ways to speed up the global warming yet again :D
Congratulations blue origin.
Skip to 1:43:00
Just Perfection.
Чё там, Рогозин уже отперделся в американском Твиттере?
1:48:53 is that toilet paper flying off on the left image?
Congrats Bezos, going to SPACE is one of my dreams too🥺🇺🇸🤍
With VHS space recordings...🙄
Fake.. CGI
Blue Origin, you better work between mission control and astronautas (radio control/connection).
WELL DONE JEFF & TEAM
I dream of of Jeanie, y'all.
Jeff who?
Astronaut Bezos.
Pero dónde están los vídeos. Oye esto es puro montaje a lo Hollywood.  Virgin Galáctic sigue siendo mil veces mejor que esto.  Y ese aterrizaje. La pobre señora de 82 años debe haber perdido los dientes con ese aterrizaje. Tremendo trastazo.
Congratulations on your well-deserved success.
Congrats to Blue Origin on a successful mission! 🚀 🌎
Good work blue origin
<3 <3
W O W
The prep took longer than the actual spaceflight - that is if you can call it that. Barely touching Karman line and back. Space tourist at best, don't bother calling yourself astronauts.
So no video from the inside?!?!?!?!....richard's flight had cameras inside and out...I felt like I was listening to George Costanza's hidden record in the meeting room..."There was a loud thump!"
Still using the Imperial System, this is like just waiting for a disaster to happen. Hopefully they're using it only for the public...
Beginning of the next semester  Teacher: Where have you been during the VACATION? Daemon: To the SPACE!!
Wow
Wow that went smooth! Great acchievement!
Congratulation Jeff & Blue Origin 🙏
🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷
Congrats ! In a very close future: Anyone can become an astronaut, you just need to sell your house. :D
Looks like a giant dildo 🤣. At least they surpassed the Kármán line. Also, these companies Virgin and Amazon shouldn't be considered as true space unless they complete a full orbit around the earth period.
1:43:08 lift off 1:45:30 MECO 1:46:42 Astronauts cheering 1:48:25 Re entry 1:49:50 1:50:08 1:50:20 landing 1:50:43 touchdown 1:51:29 Capsule re entry 1:51:45 Parachute deployed 1:52:52 Clear view 1:53:28 Capsule Touchdown 1:54:17 1:55:06 Boom Boom 1:59:43 jeff bezoz 👍 2:01:25 Coming out of Capsule 2:04:37 off topic but someone fell😂😂 2:04:51 Cheerful moment
Will a video of the experience inside the capsule be released later?  I can already hear the flat earth idiots saying there's no video to hide what they actually saw!!
That was incredible!
Wow
(My english is little weak so sorry for this)  Congratulations Jeff bejos sir and 3 others. From india 🇮🇳. Just for Fun.🤣🤣🤣👉 I talked to Elon Musk. He is feeling very jealous.
Virgin galactic was better. This was good but vg better.
Well done. Truly amazing and inspiring.
Incrível!! Parabéns!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Wally Funk, Astronaut. Well-earned.
love it
Why are we supposed to be impressed ?..didnt we go to the moon in 1969 which is 250,000 miles away yet 52 years later in 2021 we go 70 miles and this is impressive because ?...That's like  building a car in the 60s and saying u drove it around the entire world and then 50 years later building a car that went 10 feet..what am i missing here ..it's like PlayStation in 2040 making the PlayStation 1 again and expecting everyone to be Impressed with the graphics I don't get it
Congratulations from  🇨🇭
How come there aren't more dislikes? Wtf?
What about CARBON FOOTPRINT ?!?
Nice CGI!!
This just made me think that the fact 1 person can afford to do this is so wrong. When there are people dying by drowning to make a journey across a body of water just to try and achieve a better life and safety that one person should make that much money is wrong. When the times change these people are going to have to explain why they’re worth more than someone else. The amount of money this guy has is truly disgusting. He’s not doing this for mankind , otherwise it would cost the same as a normal annual holiday. It’s time people got life into some sort of perspective.
മച്ചാനെ നീ പോളിയെ മോനേ........
Its hillarious how billionaires can do something a government funded company cant
the first? after all, it is a rocket and not an airplane .................
wow
Woot woot
Congrulations Jeff And God bless you from India
That was a quick and amazing flight !Congrats !
Congratulations: Our hearts connected with the stars we dream of infinity; while we dance to life sharing our existence; looking for the balance between Love, Freedom and Respect.
Why wasn't there a live broadcast of images from inside? With 4G internet technology this is not understandable.
Production value is kind of low, where are the space images?
Congratulations to Jeff and team from India. 🇮🇳  🎉👏🌌🚀
Imagine if Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson all went to space together on the same spacecraft.  That would be absolutely incredible!
おめでとうございます💝🍀💝🍀💝😆 素晴らしいです💎💎💎💎🙆
There was not enough money for the camera inside.
Jeff go to live to the moon !
Amazing. 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
any zergs in space?
1:43:21 fantastic videogame, the fake astropenis -.-
This is how history is made. A dream, a team, and a lot of hard work. Congratulations!
Soooo inspiring Jeff!!  I haven’t been this moved since our first landing on the moon.  Thx uuu for investing into space travel and for paving the way for anyone to take a flight!  Congratulations on your accomplishment!!
The chick was so annoying.
Wow Amazing experience 👌👌
Congratulations Mark, Oliver and Wally welcome back and good job guys.
Nicely done! Congrats Blue origin. Not a huge fan of your CEO, but nevertheless an outstanding achievement! Glad it went well.
*Welcome Jeff on the earth again 👏🎉*
Jeff Blue
Congrats!!!
Too bad it’s landing on dirt ?
Maravilloso, extraordinario !!!
Wow
I mean. . . . . .what was the point. A "Spacecraft" that is nothing but a tiny pod and cant do anything except float back down. . . . . . and they didnt even go into space. This was a carnival ride at best.
earth is flat
When the fantastic movies become true
Dear mister Bezos ! We don't see nothing with you in the orbital , inside your rocket like Sir Branson !!!!! We don't see the blue line out the earth ! ...Just UP and DOWN .....there is no video inside your new shepard ! ....
2:05:53 why we sent people into space??
jeff to elon: you can try mine ship to go to space.
Super. Now rich people will measure who has traveled further in space and not who has a longer yacht)
Well done Mr Bezos and Blue Origin. A great day for humanity
Ok here come the jokes!!!!
All bad things aside, that was done and covered a lot better than what Branson did few days ago. Props to that.
looks fake af. but im not expert
I’m so happy for Wally! 😁
Vow! Thank you to share this incredible experience. Better than any SF movie. Make me feel like an astronaut for 10.30 minutes. Beautiful.
Рогозин в это время продолжает прыгать на батуте. At this time, Rogozin continues to jump on the trampoline.
Amazing! My sister would love to join you all. Congrats to builder and to freedom to think and do for ourselves. God speed
It should have blown up..that would have made for some good tv
Metriiiiiic pls. Atleast next to those
I'm currently just a T-1 pleb at an Amazon fulfillment center, but it's nice to see this and to be a part of something so successful.  Congratulations @Jeff
1:43:11
Look like a penis , something out of Austin power movie
proud of the world
Nice audio from the capsule, but it would've been nicer to also see them in flight. Congrats for a successful mission! :)
Love from Russia! It’s amazing
Congratulations ! A historic and incredible moment.
cool
very cool! sadly no view from inside the cabin :(
This will be remembered as the “origin” of commercial space travel. Incredible.
Fly safely to the Ka'ma'n Line, all sir.
So awesome!!
Am I the only one who feels that Virgin Galactic was better than Blue Origin? Galatic looked better to me
Jeff Bezos, congratulations on your safe landing！With so much money，I believe you will make good use of it，hope you can help the poor and solve social problems.
Ok, I'm up.  When's the launch?
Congratulations to the Blue Origin team!
If you travel on a Boeing 747 does that make you a #pilot? so why are travelers in automated #Space capsules called #astronaut ? operators of a  #soyuz can be landed manually if #automation fails.
From Wally to WALL-E soon
That was amazing.  Now blue origin can scale just like amazon.  Gonna be amazing seeing where they go over the next couple decades.
One more step into space, amazing!
A small step from blue origin, a big leap for mankind.
Great job to Amazing workgroup TEAM 🧠❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🎉🎉🍾🍾🍾🍾
As I much as we all like to clown on Blue,  I have to give an amazing job to the team, and a congrats to the crew on getting their wings. To the future!
what is amazing? 1 minute in cosmos? is that all?
billions of $ for just 10min GZ and no1 can give me 1000€ -.-
When the ride is $500 for the 10 minutes sign me up.  Otherwise it’s a environmental nightmare for the rich and the little people live with more heat, drought, lack of water, dirty air, crazy politicians, etc.
itna kharchaa kr hi diye the to ek do live camera bhi lagaa dete ....spacecraft ke ander
Really great experience to Jeff bezos and success to blue origin
