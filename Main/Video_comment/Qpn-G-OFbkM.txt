watch this with headphones for fun time 🤠
I was sitting here thinking "that a joke right?, I do 30 mins in quiet regularly just on self-reflection, this is child's play". Ending made complete sense to me.
Imagen falling a sleep
I'll break any record on loneliness you can set... 10x.
1:33 actually it’s -20.6DB
Can i lay down there??
YESSS!  @elemusic19 opened the door to my people. I’m field service engineer, and carry a 10in fan in my carryon.
Room I want, to study without distractions!
INSANE LOL
I could survive it
It’s OK I despise pork chops also

Why have to be dark for?
Extrovert biggest challenge

Woah kewl & dramatic
This is probably the best place to meditate
Did bro predict 41?
This is bs what if you just fell asleep technically you would easily beat the record?
WOW THAT WAS SO COOL AND DRAMATIC 🤯
6:52
My mixes would translate well in that room😅😅
"The world record is 41 minutes" Le deaf people: HOLD MY BEER.
Light off because you can hear the electricity
Weak you could easily break that record, the only thing is the boredom
i think this room is made for me who always use rough words loudly
Sounds like bliss to me. I could live in there.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
How stupid was this video?
That was very cool, very dramatic
SO COOL AND SOOO DRAMATIC RYAN
Uhhhhhhh……. U look like an alien kinda
The pork chop was so bad, it was chicken.
Beautiful

Tbh i cant imagine that this is bad😂 Sounds like peace
That was very cool and very dramatic🤣
This was cool and dramatic
''wow cool AND dramatic!!"
You've clearly never eaten five grams of psilocybin mushrooms
Tastes like chicken
I'd like to see someone who's used to auditory hallucinations sit in there
How can you sign up for this room? Do they really give $5M if yiu stay 4h?😅😂
2:16 woahhhh so cool and dramatic veryy
If the record is 41 minutes they haven't met a monk yet 😂😂😂
You got a new grandpa 21m subs
3:12  I thought you gone say what a f###
Wow that's cool thats dranatic ❤😂😂
5:09 u can hear his heartbeat
I cannot survive on this one either with my tinnitus ringing like a siren in ww2
I have been thinking. maybe something seemingly as good as quiet is bad to others. Like it applies to other things like being "too ordinary" is not good? 🤔
Can I visit that room to sleep please? I have done so much to keep my bedroom dark and quiet. I don’t really see what the problem would be?
I imagine this as forced meditation, lmao.
How teachers want classrooms with 40 students to be:
People who went to jail will happily 😊 join
I got kids I would be in there chilling
Why is the pork chop chicken?
Hahaha they mail to dr phil “sure”
wow cool AND dramatic!!
I like quiet tell me how to make my room quiet like that
Imagine being high in that room
Cool
Rubber Johnny from Aphex Twin vibes
Well your at 21M now so you should be good with the grandpa situation
You all are freaking out over this while someone that has ASMR is salivating over the thought of walking into that room
Randy Orton  "I HEAR VOICES IN MY HEAD THEY COUNCIL ME THEY UNDERSTAND THEY TALK TO ME!"
Sign me up for one hour in there. I will do it for 20 thousand dollars.
I thought you got $5m if you lasted longer than an hour as it was supposed to be impossible
This is just like solitary confinement
People who live in Minnesota  👇👇👇
Deaf people have the world record they deal with it for years
Perfect place for a nap
If you sleep inside there
OMG IT'S 2025 RN AND I JUST GOOGLED WHO IS THE WORL RECORD AND IT'S STILL YIUB
No I am
I’m the most recent comment
Wow cool and dramatic!!
Pretty sure Rick Rubin could sit in here all day
Is there any air or is it sealed
Recent world record is 58 minute. How can you stay for an hour
Couldn’t you just lay down and try to nap?
I think that room would be sweet!  Except my tinnitus would be roaring!
I would like to take up this challenge
People talking about deaf people 🤦‍♀️ i dont think u know anything about being deaf, especially being 100% deaf.
I would just sleep
That’s a chicken breast, that’s no pork chop.
The Microsoft Challenge deal you get like 5 million to stay 1 hr in their room. I came here to see if that's what you did. I think I can do 1 hr for 5 million.
I guess second quietest room makes for a shitty title, first is Microsoft’s at -20 decibels
God you’re annoying.
Think that ull be reading book in that room..  Light off is worst than prison 🗿
Terbaik
I am the experience
sex gotta be insane in this room
41
If going on how my phone keeps buzzing every 30 seconds and it seems you can never get a minute without someone bothering you somehow id try it it definitely!
I could stay there for hours 🤣🤣🤣
7:00 someone please, PLEASE tell me the name of this song! I've been looking for it for years!!
Stopped watching when you added Dr. Phil to the mix.  Seek help.
Did he ever become Dr.phils grandson
WTF that record is a myth
I would took THE LOVELIEST NAP!!
On internet it's said its -20 decibels.  Is this room not having oxygen or water or ac?
If this is true  I just want to get the guiness book of world record and stay in that room not less than 1 year 😅😂
A pork chop that looks exactly like a chicken breast 😂
I  am Steve!
All that quite room needs now is a coat of muso black lol
Wow. So cool and dramatic 😮
Something of the dumbest I have seen.
My tinitus would be more louder than ever ong lol
The decibel descriptions are pretty awful in the beginning ;) if any cafeteria is 100db thats crime against all involved :D and a concert with 150 would be attempted murder :D
Not NEARLY quiet enough! Can still hear you. Can’t take it!
Couldn’t watch more than three minutes
Literally, literal, literally, literal
Just mediate and think of Jesus. Pray the rosary and sing hymns haha
why they turned off the light thats unfair.
Yo bro, can you sponsor me for this. Or make it happen, I can beat all the records. No cap, being 💯 soild
This is my own bucket list, I'm gonna do this, 1 hour or more. I want it so bad.
Did you win 500 million dollars?
Its just like a trip on some drug bro wtf
Not the DBD Demo
My 1998 Bravada had 4 Orion HCCA 15.2s walled with 32hz tuned aeroports and 8 Rockford 1500.1 amps 1 on each voice coil. It would do a 162.3db on a 3 second burp but play around 158.3 on music and now that I'm 37 I hear a constant low frequency hum all day every day probably shouldn't have used that vehicle as a daily driver for 5 years.
come on .. 3 hours easy .. just make noises ... its the darkness not the mute chamber
One hour gets ya $2 million
Why do you have broccoli on your head?
W MINNESOTA
O could see absolute 0 decibels but not negative
How do you have negative decibels
My tinnitus would keep me entertained 😫
So the 5 million dollars is a myth too ?
How to torture a person
Why does if have yo be dark?
So i take it the videos saying you win $5million are also bullshit
I would just sing that place unstoppable
I looked it up cost $500 to be in the quiet room 😕
Extroverts will not survive
-9dB bit u Still hear...bs
Didn’t get the 5 million?
Looks like he’s taking you to the loud room on purpose to tune your body to it
Why need to be dark. N cant do any at all for 1h? Lol. I cant even do that on my room. At least let me sleep
They say your personality dies in there. Those who come out become serial killers
Who is here in 1243
30 minutes of being death drives you insane?
Isn't there prize money for doing this
All we were seeing were Gen Z struggles lol.
I dream of buying this room and record my voice for big companies and sh*t
Can anyone visit? Do you have to pay to get in ?
This reminds me of solitary confinement in a penitentiary.
Dr Phil you weird freak
I bet i could for monthd or year there. Thats my typical room here in high security prison no sound at all..
20 million views? Damn that’s pathetic. Not watching this. Lowkey it’s hilarious you thought this was a challenge along with all the others who clicked on it thinking this be hard. Yall dumb af
I could live there without a problem
When you said something about stranger things confident I just watched it
I'm sorry it wasn't that cool haha
3:11 what the FFFREAK
World record:45 minutes Me:sleeps for 12 hours
Just imagine a studio being in here
2:12 Very cool and dramatic, Ryan! (like actually though)
This seems dumb😂
This absolutely seems ridiculous 😂
I bet 1 million dollars I can beat you
Steve hmm 0:22
I really want to go in that room. I would love for the world to STFU!
Go Big Red
Best video I’ve seen in a while. Very interesting!!!
'if you survive more than an hour in this room you will die' source: the person who died... oh wait no they didnt.
My brain never shuts up. I dunno if I'd notice.
How do I build one of these to hide from my kids in?
Imagine Hell! Only the added agony and torment!!! Jesus is the only way out! Ask Him to reveal the truth! He loves you very much!
but why do you have to sit in the dark?
Take Shrooms and enter this room. The dark won’t mean a thing 😂
I could spend 24 hours straight in that room
Here on day 47 of the 50 states and 50days series and ryan looks so much younger here
I think my tinnitus would get to me before anything else.
How far with Dr Phil??
2:16 WOW SO COOL AND DRAMATIC RYAN!! btw the eyes look so freaking cool theyre glowing in the dark thats actually so awesome
Now take 10 tabs and do it for an hour
Brah I’d meditate
Why not take a nap there?
Every prisoner in the world just beat your record pal😂
Man I would pay $$$$ if they built this room into a sensory deprivation tank so I can unwind after a busy week for 7 days/nights in the ER.
I could break that record easy because I have tinnitus, my ears ringing drive me insane already 🤷
Definitely cool and dramatic
You are funny!
Pork chops are gross
Except that pork chop looked like chicken o.0
Had to go to the quietest room to find out you stink lol
couldn't a deaf person smash this record?
6:36 💀
I can do it easy, all I need is for someone to pay round trip, hotel, food and some money for a bit of fun
Id end up fallin asleep
How do i sign up F*** it
I could probably honestly spend a cool week in there just give me fruit water and a few books
That was a chicken breast.
I'd love to try definitely seems peaceful.  With bed lights during day few books eats drinks toilet ect id try a weekend.
Can’t you just like meditate through it?
6:32 😂😂 i died
I would love to pray in this room
The bathroom in my workplace could use that sound dampening.
Idk man… I don’t like pork chops either. 😂
Pshhht. I could spend days in here..easy.
I can improve upon your record in the dark and with no assistance or advantages, fair and square. No cheating.
I need to do this!
You deserve better than Dr Phil. I've heard bad things.
Isnt he supposed to stfu while hes in there?
That was cool and dramatic
5:20 lol I am the experience
Excercise, rest, reflect, dream, think, tell yourself a joke, man i could probably spend days there, just fasting, enjoying some peace and bettering myself
Very cool and Dramatic video good job!!!
So is doc Phil your grandfather now?
I got this all day
Nonsense, minus 6 decibels don't exist.
Adhd and vocal stimming easy W
Sign me up!! I’ll stay in there for a couple days!
Commenting on all of Ryan trahans videos part 173
2025 ANYONE ?
It wasn't the worlds quietest room... because you were talking in it LOL.
I have done this.  I could hear my eyes squish and joints move.  It was so messed up. Then I got out and headache in minutes
6:53
Ryan Trahan casually being in that room for a hour:
W off brand avenger
Wow so cool and dramatic
Finally, a perfect place to take my 30 minutes afternoon nap that magically turns in to 3h sleep 😌
I'd just love it there.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Wow! Cool and dramatic!
Are you allowed to just go to sleep?
im guessing falling asleep doesnt count
This is my dream ,noises make me agressive 😂
Breath,meditate !
You're totally wrong . Pizza and Beer  taste way better with the noise of a football game on  😄
Moms would love this
Wouldnt last 5mins with my tinnitus in my right ear. Be tapping out pretty quick.
I could easily spend 2 days in this room with no issue. If money were on the line it would be nothing.
Couldn't mediation elevate some of this?
rip Ryan
So if this is so impossible to take, why don't those who go deaf lose their minds?
After 7 minutes, in that room in the dark like that, I would have been singing on repeat: "I'm ENERY THE EIGHTH I AM...."
I’m here to say that this video is cool and dramatic!! Lol
Easy.
3:03 i would have fallen asleep already lol
omg thats so fun and dramatic!
It is a very noisy distracting world.
Finally, I'd be able to get some sleep!
Why can’t you just take a nap?
Why u in the dark
This is what being without a woman is like 😂
Everyone comparing this to living as a deaf person really don't understand the difference, huh?
Wow cool and dramatic
I probably would just go to sleep lol
Wow cool AND dramatic
Being deaf, I find this hilarious.
If i get paid i will do it even a couple of hours 😊

Why were your ears popping?
Ez game

I wonder how long me and my tinitus would last 😂
I think your dad told you that chicken breast was a pork chop 😂😂😂
As someone who regularly meditates, i would LOVE to be in that room

That was really cool and dramatic with a sick drone shot!!!!
This is easy

WOW THIS IS COOL & DRAMATIC IN 2025 🤩

Why does it have to be dark? The dark would bother me more than the quiet.

A deaf person can break the record
Tinnitus, this would be torture
Why would the lights be off though? What is the purpose of that?  Yeah they definitely did it originally designed this as a torture device
Someone needs to go into a room like this for an entire LSD trip and see what happens
i want it😂.. for sure i want my room like that please
i want it😂.. for sure i want my room like that please
lmao
No one has spent more than 45 minutes in here.                     Ryan Trahan: Am I a joke to you.
tbh i could do this because my adhd mind will keep me safe ill be playing clarence episodes in my head
Could be more comfortable in a horizontal position
I could do hours that room over ten years meditation all gotta do go into meditative state break Guinness world records with that…🤷‍♂️
I can always hear my ears, I think I can do this
The loud room is basically like jail

I would like to try this

“wow cool and dramatic” :(
I can tell, 60 minutes is will be really hard, however, 15 mintues should for average of people can stay.  For people have zen or training, 60 minutes is not a hard thing for sure

Wow, this is so cool and dramatic

School cafeteria 100 dB??? What are you doing over there?
Cool and dramatic😊😊

Those shots were very cool and dramatic
And that’s why I sleep with 24/7 rain sounds on.

Are you allowed to nap? I always take a stress nap in the MRI. I figure that would work here too.
So cool and fun
This is deaf people life so you will be fine it’s just publicity I could stay in there till the next day I need the peace to be honest lol Americans are so dramatic lol I knew it was a myth
Don't forget lemon with your pork chop.🍋 And a little parsley wouldn't hurt. I miss my Dads. Enjoy yours, and your Dad too!🙂✌

2:56 i was hearing MORSE CODE.
One of my coworkers told me that the challenges if you’re in there for an hour, you would win $5 million. I don’t know if that’s true or not but would you win some kind of cash reward or whatever for trying something like that? And how do I go about signing up to try it?
Wow cool and dramatic!
You lost me at eating pig.
Hook me up a game console and some snacks and this is the best room ever
Wow this is so cool and dramatic!!
Wow! That’s cool and dramatic!
If your a meditation practitioner you can stay there for a year when you get food and everything there...I would try to do meditation there....because if your mind run wild you won't be able to sit there for a second. So quite your mind there
I got bad trip on acid and i couldn't quit till the end, that was sick shit😅😂 i wonder how it feel inside there

That was cool and dramatic!

it was cool and dramatic!!!!
I kind of want to see what the insane feels like.
Why is light excluded?  Can you hear photons?  This is sensory deprivation and NOT just about sound!

Anyone else notice that pork chop looked a hell of a lot like a chicken breast?
I would have just laid down and took a nap
It’s not the world’s quietest room. Microsoft has that and it’s -20.6dB
This dude's funny 😂 when he said "my breath is KICKIN" and then after he sniffs himself and goes "elevated". Lmaooo
Isn't there a quiet room in Seattle?
I know people who meditate for hours with noise canceling headphones. They could spend hours in there.
I can bet that tell Steve
wow cool AND dramatic!!
"And my chest feels tighter than a camel's butt in the middle of a sandstorm"  😂 Great line, Ryan
Would be a great place to pray  🙏
I would like to take on the challenge of being in this room and would love to do this if anyone can help please message me
Did you earned 5 million dollars or is it a myth

Wow! Cool and dramatic!
They would have to come and wake me after 12 hours of sleep. I have tinitus so i don´t know what quiet is. No idiots being loud on the street, no cars with stupid muflers... What a beautifull room.
Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezie

3 years ayyyyy😊❤😂😅😊❤
Deaf people:we're in the way
The world's most quitest room is my heart🫀......
Get a salt water bath and have an entire isolation tank experience. Either way, looks like a great place to meditate
i would spend years in this room and nothing will happen to me
Did you get your new adoptive Gramps? 😊
My thoughts will be louder than the stillness in that room
I want to take a long nap in that room, bring a comfy mattress and a cozy pillow and blanket, I bet you'd have the best sleep of your life
Three years later, still cool and dramatic 👍

I suspect a neurodivergent would find it quite relaxing
Parents are like "can I do that for about a week?"
So you hear your body fluids… how cool.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
I wish this was my room to get away from everything
That room turned Ryan into a philosopher 😭
Can you hear your own heart beat?,
Christ, it's a quiet room, not a world war 2 battlefield. Get a grip
This is what I wish my house would be when I try to sleep at night.   I would probably just go to sleep.   👀
Would I be able to hear my own tinnitus?
easyest record to beat
wow! cood and dramatic!
I need this quietness in my apartment
wow that was cool and dramatic!
That was cute! You ARE the experience 😂😂😂
I could do the quiet. I am mostly deaf, anyway. Do I get a night light?
So...why can't I just sleep
So cool
I would love to stay in quiet and peace.
Arte naman nito
İ can be there more then 3 h
What a stupid idea for a video
My tinitus would be as loud as ever and drive me insane.
As someone with tinnitus, this room would probably be hell because I can only imagine how loud that would be 🫠
Ohhhhhh challenge accepted.  I can break the record hands down. I'm deaf in one ear and have battled Meneares disease my whole life. You all are going down😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can cook that record cuzo
I can do 24 hours in it. No food No water. Easily. I am impenetrable.
As a mom of 5 little kids...I think I would love this room.
I would go crazy from my tinnitus.
Best tor Study
am watching this from Ethiopia too!
Im gonna go there after being up over 24 hours and take nyquil prior 😂😂 Run me my money
I love the stranger things references 😂
you can just take a nap there
has dr. phil adopted you now that you have like 17 millon subs?
I would make bet that Helen Keller could pwn this record if she were still alive.
Let that be my apartment, please! (I am autistic with misophonia.)
Cool and dramatic
being hard of hearing i think i couls stay in there indefinatley with life support lol
And at the 35-minute mark ,you bust ass 💀
IT NARRRRRRRRRLY
His eyes in the dark
Is bologna even meat-like though?
I have tinnitus. It's never "quiet".
I guarantee I can break that they soft as hell
Instead of comparing negative  9 decimals to loud ones , it would make more sense to give quiet decimals sounds in comparison with the -9 🤔
school cafeteria 100dB? nope, those sound levels are all like ´-25dB from what this video says
It's the claustrophobia. Not the fact that it's the "quietest room" that gets to ppl. There are blind and deaf ppl and unfortunately some are both. The quietness isn't what gets to ppl.
i can do this for a week with no problem
Why did my school play this video as an, educational video,😭😭😭😭
Guessing my tinnitus would drive me even more nuts in there.
I have tinnitus there is no quiet room for me.
“wow cool AND dramatic!!” :(
I could live there for life!!!
Calling a chicken breast a pork chop is crazy lol
Stop eating pigs
Microsoft gives 5 million for anyone who stays in th room for 1 hour and supposedly no one has done it. Tag me please if you do it
So did u win the 5 million dollars
What??? I can hang out in the quiet rooms for weeks! Finally something for us people who love to be by ourselves 😂
2024 anyone
This is how I sleep at night. Dark and quiet.
wow cool AND dramatic!! 2:15
This is basically a teachers dream
I’m trying to see David Goggins break this challenge
I wear foam earplugs to focus on reading and can hear my heartbeat. This would be a breeze.
Hard pass on Dr Phil.
Super dramatic and cool!   Yes for sure!  Believe me!   I am not kidding!
wow sow cool
i want to do it
I am ok for this but as long there are no ghosts 😊
Its chicken feet,if you can stay in a jail in single man cell this is chicken feet just do meditation i like to be in quiet place,holy main saints and monks would love this place this quiet room make their meditation easier by 50 % 😜
Oh please. Just let someone with misophonia in and they never want to leave.
Im deaf and im laughing at this like nelson would do to Bart after bullying. Point and all.   Thats cute.
I would just need something to do
Did u get a million?
Only hackers can do this :þ
Start OM chants
This is sleeping without a dream feels like
I'm sorry. For what?
Just shut up dude. What's the point of the quiet room if you keep talking. How about you do a challenge for how long you can keep your mouth shut.
I would take my sleep meds like 30 mins before then go to sleep in there lol can we put a recliner chair 😭
Id survive if i could play on my phone lol
I tought they give You 5 mil If You stay 1 hour...
You look like a little kid well your in there
Does my tinnitus get louder?
Most cool and the most highly dramatic video I’ve ever seen.
It’s was cool and dramatic
WOW! That was COOL and DRAMATIC! 😎😎😎
the record is a myth 😂
I have tinnitus so this wouldn’t be fun for me
My toxic trait is that I think I can do this indefinitely 😂
wow cool and dramatic
I already have outstanding hearing. I would love to try this. Absolutely love it. How much do I have to pay to experience this? Not saying I would break a record, but I definitely would try this.
That ia juat terrifing. espescially if your in the dark and someone trys to creep up on you
Im so introverted I'd just workout and sleep til times up 😆 🤣 😊 I wanna try this 1
I need that room!!  Sign me up :-)
Lol its easy
“the world record is 41 minutes”   Deaf people: urderderrfndrmelelele 👌☝️✌️👇👉👎
So you were deaf for a couple minutes. Bite me.
SO COOL
Basic for introvert person
Would love to meditate in there.
Could you hear a mouse fart?
I could stay in there for as long as I had food and water to survive.
Yeah the dark would get me before the quietness 😂😂😂😂
Dramatic yes  Cool??
Tinnitus 😢
Dr. Phil is a MAGA creep.
As a deaf person I could easily spend hours or even days in that quiet room, just give me a pillow and a blanket and I'll could take a very long nap
How dramatic! Fooey....
Navy Standards Primary Laboratory has an anechoic chamber. Probably not the quietest but likely within the top five. I spent two minutes inside of it and it was maddening.  1. we don't realize how attuned we are to room reflections until they are no longer there,  2. The sound of one's heartbeat and breathing becomes the loudest sound and it's really unsettling. 0/10 recommend.
Dude I can hang out in there for days. Love it. I actually watched this video 3 years ago and then built my entire room that I sleep in with similar materials to this. My room is not -9 decibels. Its around 4-6 decibals. I ended up having to not only get a more expensive higher quality TV that made less sound but I also had to get rid of my ceiling fans and put in specialty lights because my room is so quiet that it makes those things sound incredibly loud and become a great annoyance. I ended up putting in a secondary small AC unit to power my room and I built the AC ducts with conical materials That you would end up using in like a sound room so that it wouldn't make a lot of noise coming into the room and ended up being great. I grew up having severe insomnia and have had to be on a myriad of cocktails to shut down my mind put me to sleep. Now I'm only down to one of them, I used to take three. Not only that but the only one that I'm left on was the less potent of all three. It was definitely a project and a pain in the ass but absolutely worth it. Changed my life.
As someone with tinnitus, I suspect that this room would be profoundly unpleasant.
WOW COOL AND DRAMATIC
Has to be in the dark?  So you win or not? I want to try it 👍🏻
Hellen Keller: hold my braille
I like ur content
I'm pretty sure alot of us guys that have been locked up are laughing at this record.
me with tinnitus: how's that any different from my bedroom?
i could easily stay there for hours tbh, just need my phone, no volume or anything
Dang you skunked Dr. Phill in subscriber growth 😂😂😂
2025
2024
This was cool and traumatic
Why the dark though?
wow this is cool and awesome 😏
POV: the classroom after I tell a joke
I would survive this easily. I have tinnitus. 😉
I want this room in my house. ❤💯
But why are the lights off?
Me after I try to make a joke:
So cool, so dramatic.
Aaron Rodgers is next
And this is the day he developed tinnitus
Ryan:  the world's quietest room-- so scary!  deaf people:  yaaaaa, not so much. people with tinnitus:  AAAAAAAA GOD NO!!!!
Are you able to meditate in there? I feel like that record would be easy to break if so
if someone paid you ONE MILLION DOLLARS(pre-tax)(no benefits, 10 days vacation a year, 10 sick days) to spend 40 hours a week in the quiet room, being quiet, with no cell phone/book/ipod/radio/fidget spinner/deck of cards/etc, STAYING AWAKE, would you take it?
This is so cool and dramatic!
Who is watching it now 😅
I’d be actually happy to be there for at least one hour
What a load. This is stupid.
Two word emails😂😂😂😂 loooollllll😂😂
Imagine how good asmr would sound in that room 😂

Why is your eyes like this the eyes look like a demon 2:36
Wow, cool and dramatic!
What city is that in MN?
Fascinating -- fun vid, thanks!  Not a math genius, here, but I'm actually really interested in the design of this room's surfaces: I like the massive scale of the ridges (word?) -- that's got to be great for low-frequency, high energy sound waves, and also the addition of the netting over the face of each rib to create surface turbulences (reducing energy and creating destructive reflections, I'm guessing) across the surfaces, but I've so many questions and ideas, now: I'm wondering whether it would work better to tilt or curve the netting's splines as you would tilt the ribs of a helical slake, and maybe the geometry of the peaks of each ridge should be razor-sharp (ish)? I'll bet the size, shape and angle of each peak could change as the array approaches the corners of the room, and perhaps the ends of each ridge could be shaped to interact even more quietly with the faces of the adjacent ridges (and should those even be flat?);  Perhaps an open mesh floor could be used to remove all those reflections, as well: in other words, just how deep can this quiet room "rabbit hole" go?  I think Imma gonna go design a recording booth, now :)
wow cool AND dramatic!!
🌠
Would record is1hr
that was so cool and  dramtic
Wow! Cool AND dramatic! 🤩
I wonder if a buddhist monk can do it

Zero dopamine.
But why did he have to do it in the dark?
doubling that with the darkness as well, but kinda have to make noise unless you have like zero noise lights, which I thought would be a thing
Can you do pushups? Is an easy one bro, i hope
Ryan's jokes always kills me 😂.
Wow cool AND dramatic!

Introverts paradise, lol
Being in the quiet room wouldn't be a problem.sitting there for forty one minutes by yourself would be
Wow! Cool AND dramatic!😅 2:11
I dont understand this science. Food either tastes good or it doesn't. I've had great food in noisy pubs.  Also that room would be amazing for my sleep
I can stay there for one day straight without problems.
😂 week humans  I would welcome this in a secound Best night of sleep ever as long as its cold enough

Wears a baseball cap and is using a mobile phone while eating a meal.... That's what is wrong with people like him. He thinks that behaviour is acceptable. It shows a huge lack of education, social skills, basic manners, etc.
Idk I was in isolation for weeks, I can handle 45 min
That's crazy 😮
Is 2024 and you have 17M sub so I think he can be your grandpa noe..
Cool And Dramatic
How is this insanity ? I sleep with earplugs lmao
Imagine going in there to pray.. lol

Ryan Trahan went there and the guy that created it said the record is a myth after he thought he broke the record that people could sit in there for days if they wanted to
cool
This is what mental illness can feel like Believe me
Well now you got 16 M subscribers and he has 6M
Where do I apply?
Ryan, I already searched up how many subs Dr. Phill has, you've beat him. You are now officially Dr. Phill's grandson, congrats!!!
I wish i could be in there forever. Get away from the loudness and stupidity that's going on in today's world.
I don’t understand, so no 5 million dollars reward?

Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Yo I feel like that room would be easy for me to stay in because my fiancé snores load from time to time and I need absolute silence to sleep,I wear earplugs. I must have them when I sleep, I can’t stand a fan lol I like to have all darkness as well. Idk why I’m just that way

WR because of how much they’re charging you to stay in there?
wow cool AND dramatic
I would probably take a long nap.
Very cool and dramatic
Sometimes when it’s really quiet I can hear my ears ringing, like tinnitus but it has to be deathly quiet for me to notice it.
I could sit in there all day
My teacher was explaining smthn to us and she mentioned u and this video and an example
Not sure but if a deaf person was in there for a day the body will make you hear again 😊
“Sense of touch…. Elevated ✅
Thats lame. Survive the loudest room
Spends 30 minutes in the world's quietest room..... decides to read all of the literature written on  John Wayne Gacy and take the steps nessacary in order to emulate his actions with 100% accuracy...
so was the chicken breast supposed to be a joke? im so confused
lol keep up the good content
wow this was so cool and dramatic :)
Just to let you know, this isn’t the worlds quietest room, the military has much better anechoic chambers. @Ryan Trahan

This is what Planet Fitness wishes it could be.
Why are the lights turned off?
Think of prisoners who spends weeks in solitary confinement, which is similar like sitting in this silence room.
Bro i beat this challange all day😂
I can be in there way longer than 41 min. I love ultra quiet. The quiet that makes your ears ring.
LOL this is my life for hours, everyday. Weak.

Jesus died and rose agian if you believe that he died and rose and were saved by grace through faith alone you will be saved. Once Saved Always saved no need to repent from your sins for salvation. ,
wow cool and dramatic
It's interesting how most people don't really think about the fact that we're essentially never in silence, especially with phones lately.  I love peace and quiet sometimes and not have distractions. A quiet or acoustically treated room or car also improves the audio quality of speakers so things sound good at low volumes, unlike those loud ass living rooms where people turn up their crappy TV speakers and soundbars because they can't understand dialogue in movies or have to yell to have a conversation.
Wow cool! dramatic!
i do a whole night, no problem
Seems to me the record should be 8 hours minimum because I’d just sleep
This is cool and dramatic😅
Wow cool and dramatic
just bring an ipad kid it will get louder bcz he would defiantly break the walls from raging

So cool and dramatic!
Wow, cool & dramatic! :D
If I have autism, that room is very suitable
I visited this room and only stayed in there for like 7 minutes, the silence is just absurdly loud
Meditation is the key
The talking and stuff in the quiet room while trying this challenge defeats the challenge.
I think I would enjoy this room.
This was the MOST cool and dramatic video on YouTube, many even the entire internet!!!
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Wow this video was so cool and dramatic
I'm SCARED😮
It was cool
Does it have to be completely DARK though? That's what actually drives people insane....
1:49 self improvement room 3:15 🤭😵‍💫🤣
Why are the lights off? The challange is dealing with the silence. And can't you just go to sleep?
I was born without a sense of smell. I wonder how that would play out for me.

This was soooo cool and dramatic ryan❤❤❤❤
Bro used for the football, game my home state college😁
wow cool!!!! AND dramatic
WoW! Its so cool and dramatic!
a world record for the most useless video
the speaker in thai: 200dB💀
I could do a full 24 hours easily.
It's not the quietness, it's the darkness that made people quit so early. Totally unnecessary to put the test subjects into a pitch-dark room. It ruins the whole experiment.
Would be the perfect recording studio 😂
Extrovert: After 1 minute. "Noooooooo!!"  Introvert: After immeasurable time. "Finally peace and quiet"
2:16 this was cool and dramatic 👍
Depeche Mode Enjoy
Perfect room for meditation.
Any mom or parent would understand that this is luxury. Omg I would be taking to Go the whole time in peace
cool and dramatic
Weak
I have been click-baited
Seems easy
2.15. it was cool and dramatic! :)
Thats  what Finns love!! Try to visit Finland? sauna sauna sauna lake lake lake No one tooks..to u.. Well not a lot anyway. We even had a song Kaija Koo Niin kaunis on hiljaisuus (Silence is beautiful)
Nothing beats the grave. 6 feet under, darkness and alone for a long long time!!!
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Tinnitus: Am I a joke to you
WOW COOL AND DRAMATIC
I already have pulsatile tinnitus, i can't imagine how loud it would be in this room
41 days would have been more of a world record 41 minutes was the time to beat that's a joke
What? Have y'all been to jail?
What is the name of the music added in the last part?
Who else thinks this kid is gay with a rainbow 🌈 sticker on his back bumper
It was cool and dramatic🎉❤
I'm starting to get the impression youtubers doing these experiments are being a little overdramatic about it.
Where is this!!! I want to go as I need utter silence at bedtime 😂
YOU BEAT HIM IN SUBS
Imagine being in there when your high😂
The record is actually three minutes in the world's quietest room in which it is said that you can hear your own heartbeat. So this was one of the quietest rooms. Not the quietest room.
Is that serious? What a BS! Everyone could stay peacefully on that shit untill hungry or thisrty without a single problem.
The whole point is that you start to hear your bodily noises, the whole deaf comparison thing going on is literally nonsense
I saw a face behind him😮
Didn't look like a pork chop to me. No bone.
Wow cool and dRAmATIC:)))))
This is what my room feels like when I actually turn off my computer😂
Is Dr Phil your grandpa yet?
Can deaf people participate?
Wow cool and Dramatic
These are people who are extroverts. Anyone that enjoys quiet would fall asleep in that room easily breaking the record
Why couldn't you just shut up?
“The silence is loud” -Ryan
why don’t you just fall asleep in there..if it’s quiet, give me a blanket and a hot water bottle, i’ll be out for hours
Dude could’ve had the ultimate meditative experience if he just closed his eyes and shut up. I would’ve been zen’ed out for 2 hours
wow cool AND dramatic!
Yuh
I have tinnitus. It's not even noticeable as long as there is something to drown it out. I need at least around 50 db going at all times, especially when I'm trying to sleep. When I get to around 30 db that ring in my ears turns into a hum, and it just gets louder, louder, and LOUDER. I would probably be driven insane within 5 minutes of entering that room.
2:15 wow so cool and dramatic
Would be great to have a room like this, except with a bed and a pillow
“this video was cool AND dramatic!” 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤ seriously though it was 😂😂😂😂 I love u Ryan ❤❤
I find it VERY difficult to believe that the world record is 45 minutes.  I can sit alone with my thoughts for that long, no problem.  I'd probably fall alseep.
41 obviously has some symbolic meaning you’re not sharing
Tinnitus says it's never quiet
You are the Experience 😮  Bro has the potential to be a Himalayan Yogi..
Why is bro covering his ear in the thumbnail💀💀
You are officially apart of the black community cause boy was I Rollin when he brought up his breathe ND the no idea 12 min took me to a different state
I used to live in a really really quiet place then I had to move and the new place is noisy af. So now I can’t sleep without a fan on to the point where I have two back up fans in storage for when the motor wears out on the current one.  Silence is so important but once you go to “the other side” it causes a whole host of problems like anxiety and even gastrointestinal upset 😣.  I’m on medication for various crap I didn’t have when I lived in the quiet place 😣
2:18 wOw So cOoL aNd DRAMATIC  👍
This was very cool and dramatic
wow cool and dramatic😃
Wow cool and AMAZING
He would NOT last that long if he didn't have a camera/an audience to talk to and he was just alone. You can literally last multiple hours if you are taking to an audience who will view what your saying. I would like to see him do this again, but without a camera or mic in there with him, just him by himself.
those who watched inside out know minnesota well
Ur gone die in one of this vids
Put me in there at 11pm and I could stay a full 10 hours
Wow that was coolabd dramatic ("√")
Ryan is WAY past Dr. Phil's subscriber count now. Why no grandpa?
Don’t fight just be it!
I break that easy
"Damn bro you got the whole squad laughing" Where the squad is:
Golly gee with the metaphor’s
What area of MN
All the world: this room drives people crazy. Me: ok nap time 😴😴😴
It's more like you are bored and not because of noise level🤷🏻🤷🏻....like for eg if u takeaway mobile from todays gen kids...they become blind and socially awkward 🤷🏻🤷🏻... similar things happen here....give him a paper of cellphone then will stay there
I fell asleep
The world's loudest sounds like a jails holding cell🤣😂
Wow cool AND dramatic ! XD
I hear my body a lot
Why it need to be dark
Wow❤
opps 2:12 dont be mad
cool and dramatic 8:04
This video is Super cool and dramatic!
with the bar thing i would enjoy it more because i also enjoy the company of others i like the energy of others drinking and enjoying there food too if its empty it gives me a sense of hopelessness and stuff
I would of just went to sleep
HI I'm from 2024 did Dr Phil end up adopting you..? 🤣
If that was really cool and dramatic👇
3:34 this is cool. Less noise make food taste better
This is so cool and dramatic
It’s SO cool and …
Anyone took a dog in there yet?
this is so weird
I wonder what it's like to do acid in a room like that 🤔
Wow cool and dramatic!!
Ryan: I like porkchop yay.me:same
0:14 did anyone else notice the sign that says committed when he said he’s committed😂😂😂
<3
Wow soo cool and dramatic
I like the way Steve talks
Your porch chops sound, as if they where tasty 😋
It can maximum be 0 decibel cant be minus as far as i know
It’s just like any elevator in Finland 😅
probably be easier to take a nap than just sit there
I have never had to turn the volume down on a video this much to bring it to a reasonable level. For that reason, without watching the rest of your video, thumbs down. If you choose in your editing to make a video this loud, it will get a thumbs down.
I love quiet. I could sleep for hours.
Just go to sleep
It’s baloney.
Within 3 minutes i would have fallen asleep and been snoring! REM is a hell of a drug!
I have tinnitus for many years now so I never have silence …🥲 I guess that means I can stay in this room as long as I want I guess 😅
Extroverts: This would drive me crazy!!!  Introverts: Ahhh, sign me up!!!
Wow, cool AND dramatic :(
this was very cool, and also very dramatic.
coool and dramatic
Aren't you suppose to be silent as well?you literally talked the entire video.
This was not cool and dramatic
HARAM!!!!
Literally every room when I tell a joke.
Was the original record holder also a child?
CLIIIIICK BA.......oh....shhh!
That was cool and dramatic….surely just have a nap and blow the record out the water?
Nah man - I spent days testing the anechoic chamber at the University of Salford. You can go hours in there once you're used to it!
Being a man of zen and meditative experiences, I have no problem to break his record
Dramatic
I know people in higher places who sit 8 hours a day in absolutely silence doing absolutely nothing and still get payed more then us.
My tinnitus would destroy me 3 seconds in that room lol
Wow Ryan your such and inspiring person your my idol, your documentary was so cool(no seriously tho)
This would be heaven for me. I live in San Antonio, TX, inconsiderate noisy neighbors. Haven't had a quiet day in 15 years here. And I suffer from Hyperacusis
lol i could do 2 hours
BUSSIN! SHEESH THAT BROCCOLI HAIRCUT IS LIT FAM FR FR ONG!
I could spend tons of time in there.
Please learn what "literally" means.  You're killing me
i have tinnitus. i hear my ears without being in that room. that room wouldn't be quiet for me at all. it would be torture
Wait til you get older. You will enjoy the peace and quiet atmosphere even more.
This is heaven , where do I sign up
2:21 cool and dramatic
Your eyes are glowing
Idk why but seeing and hearing the word "quietest room" make me angry and terryfing . Lol. I really hate 0 noises. I don't talk that much alsoi hate toomuch noise but i want to listen to something everytime.
I once found the back seat of a Lincoln disturbingly quiet. Everything's rushing past you, and you're sitting in still air and silence. Feels unnatural.
That was chicken.
"If I make sounds it won't really be a record so I'm gonna shut up.." .... literally talks 3 seconds later and makes sounds
wow cool and dramatic
Just watched a guy on YouTube that was in solitary confinement for 27 years .. he was hallucinating etc ..
I, now, want someone to click and drag a root beer down my gullet.
I can only imagine how loud the crickets in my head would be if I spent time in that room.
The pork chops 😂
Every anechoic chamber for RF testing is like this.
I could beat that time easy
Nice pewdie pie impression. Wait... does he just sound like that?
Can i please go here!!!???
Wouldn’t work for me as my roaring tinnitus gets louder in a quiet room, that would be my idea of hell😫😝
This is cringe. I’ve lived on farms. Super super quiet at night
The worlds quietist room sounds amazing.
My girlfriend lives in this room 24/7.
Wow super cool and dramatic I am totally being sarcastic right now
That’s nothing. Would have gone in and gone to sleep for a couple hours.
So brave and stunning thank you for your service.
i love this room
I'd just start singing 😂
Is there a lock on the door?
wow cool AND dramatic!!
👇
If you're the son of mine , and you're fiddling with your damn cellphone at the dinnertable, i'm going to trash your phone and tell you to cook your own damn meal from now on.  No respect for your father -  AT ALL.
I would trip on acid and listen to music in that room. It would be a pure experience.
I’d take a nap and break the record
So this is why vampires sleep in a sound proof coffin because they hear EVERYTHING
I am the seed in the dirt
The world record is 1:07 minutes and u didnt beat it
Wow cool and dramatic!
wow cool AND dramatic!!
I litteraly would fall asleep 👍.
Wow Cool And Dramatic Ryan! (Remember the note you wanted us to write down...) 😊
How do I get one of those rooms?  It’s my dream.
wow cool and dramatic :)
No, I’ll spend 8 hours in there!
I’ll spend 2 hours in that room!
4:28 you already did pass him in subscribers, but not in views.
Most ppl would pay big bucks to be in this situation
it is cool and dramatic
why do you have to hve the lights off?
I gotta good there
This is cool and Dramatic
Really? Easiest thing to do ever!
If I had video games I would survive for an day
Back in the 1960's I went with my school class to Riverbank Laboratory in Geneva, and was in what was then, the worlds quietest room.  They said it was so quiet you could actually hear the air molecules bumping into each other.
The record is 45 minutes??! I could probably do 4.5 days if I could get away from the family.
I would go to sleep
As someone with 4 siblings this sound like heaven
I helped demolish an anechoic chamber in a University of Illinois lab that was being renovated.  It mainly consisted of cone-shaped styrofoam.  I beleive that the room was about 10 X20 feet.
Typical millenial - needs constant stimulation and input.
Was it after the cowpies choked In the playoffs again? 😂
Sensory deprivation room, you should try the tank exact body temperature. You float in total darkness. Cannot hear anything.  Cannot see anything and you float in salt. Water that keeps you buoyant. Samadi tank
Anybody with loud kids would love to spend a couple hours in there. 😅
Whatever then how do deff people cope?
Wow cool AND dramatic
quiet to loud
hyperacusis heaven
1:18 cool
I could do that for 24 hours easy lmfao.
Id sleep a full 8 hours in that room
Complete dead silence is the loudest noise you’ll ever hear.
I watched untill the enterprise spot came on you get a rental you get a rental !!!! next video

Lol
sounds heavenly. i suffer from hyperacusis and i really wish i had a bedroom like this.
Awesome

Wow Cool and Dramatic :O
Nothing will quit the voices in my head.

I’m guessing this is what outer space is like. Much respect to the men and women that E.T phone home

I want to adopt Ryan as my son. (Mainly because he's cool, but I wouldn't mind trying his dad's famous pork chops. They looked really good.)
wow cool and dramatic!
WOW COOL AND DRAMATIC!

Did Dr. Phil ever become his grandpa?
3:31
The quietest room is taking away our decibels
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Me who has been front row to several rock concerts without ear protection and now has slight tinnitus: 😬
Bro really just took a photo from dbd very cool
Wow! So cool and dramatic
That was so cool and dramatic
I’d love to try this and see
I can imagine its so quiet in there you can hear your own blood flowing in your head
I'd bring my favorite pillow and blanket and get some sleep.
I love the silence
Doubt it
WOW COOL AND DRAMATIC!!
Wow! Cool and dramatic!
AAAAAAAAAAAAH.           *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-*

M.
WoAh AwEsOmE pHoToS rYaN
As a woman with a few small children, I wouldn’t mind sleeping in that room 1 night out of the week
I get to spend 3 days in the world's quietest room every time me and the missus have a disagreement.
4 an idea? it Would be even More Quiet in that Room if He would have Modified that Flat Floor in that Room az Well????
Wow…. So dramatic 😐
howdy,Ryan
wow this video was really cool and dramatic
wow so cool and dramatic
The video is sooo cool and dramatic 😮
That was cool and dramatic, Ryan.
"My chest is tighter than a camels butt in the middle of a sandstorm"
I could easily do this and be perfectly fine because I'd just sit in there and fall asleep 😂
What would it be for someone with tinnitus? I have tinnitus and my ears always ring.
Deep philsophical questions in life: Exist. Ryan: "I am the experience." Bro effin nailed it. 💀
wow! this video was really cool and dramatic, thanks ryan!
Cool
😍
Wow cool AND dramatic!!😱😱
Yes. I can imagine how difficult it is for an American addicted to social media
kids today have no idea
Your sense of smell is elevated because you forgot to put on deodorant.
How to make views: upload stupid crap
7:45becoming canny music
Can you hear your hair getting more broccoli like? 🙄
How can a room be -9 decabls?
I lost all respect for you when you started with the Dr. Phil crap.
Silence is golden. 😊 especially when you're in an environment  with noise you hate for long periods of time
wow cool AND dramatic!!
quiet
I would take shrooms and go into this
You could have been doing pushups
this was so cool and dramatic😉
Wow SO DRamaTiC anD CoOl
wow! so cool and dramatic!!
I LOVE HOW YOU PUT KISS ON THE ROCK CONCERT I LOVE KISS
Omg this is so cool and dramatic!
Very cool and dramatic video. For everyone saying this sounds like heaven cause you like quiet, I don't think this vid appropriately captures this is beyond silence. Anyone who's been in a sound chamber knows what I mean but it's not quiet, it's a void. You physically feel the silence
Those sre rookie numbers id live in that room
8:01 ugh how did i get fucked UP THIS BADLY
2:46 i told you idiot
0:01 your fucked😂
I’ve recently started doing the isolation chamber for anxiety. It was scary at first but now I enjoy it. I do an hour twice a month and really enjoy it
Is there like a reward for staying in the room? Because i am not bothered by my ears ringing and hearing my own body
This video would have been so much better if you had taken it seriously.
People who are good in meditation can survive this even more than all those records
Wow cool and dramatic
I live in Minnesota so I need to go here!
I think I’d love that room actually. I’ve always wanted to experience total separation from the world. Even for just a moment
I accept the challenge
Wooooow cool and dramatic!🎉
just curious, i know this is 2 years late, but do you have to be awake or fully concious? i could easy do like 6 hours with enough things youtube might ban my account i like too much to be banned for.
:D
wow! cool and DRAMATIC
Me when I make a joke The whole entire room:
Wow cool AND dramatic!
I think I would sing their 😂😂
I would like to meditate inside that room for the whole night.
the way i would PUKE if i could hear my fluid
WOW. Cool and dramatic
Wow that was very cool and dramatic 😂
Wow cool and dramatic
you broke a world record without even fucking trying? what happend with the other ones? are the r3t4rded?
Your eye when you were in the dark it looks so ☺️ cute
That would be easy my ear ring so loud that's all I can hear
Tik tok generation wouldn't last 2 minutes
Bet a parent could go in there and sleep for days
Wildlife documentary of the Caucasian male 😂😭💀🙌🏾
"you didn't have to dress up for this" LOL he got you so good
I need peace like that
We all sleep with a fan probably becuase we all have tinnitus
2 years down the line and Ryan has more than twice the subscribers as his granpa
this video tops bro
"meat like substance" 😰
Try the pork chop with mozzarella or swiss melted on top.
Omg this is so boring
I liked my own comment
This video is very cool and dramatic
1:58 you look scary.
Ends up meeting Dr. Phil & totally sh!tz the bed during his shot!
Have a bad sickening feeling that vids like this with ppl just like him are gonna be the prototype for AI generated youtube vids of the future. Who knows, we might already be too late.
Just you even being in that room was pissing me off lol
this was so cool and dramatic
Let the quet kid survive 😂😂
Wow cool and dramatic
I think i would survive hours if not days
I hope he did this after taking a few bong rips
WOW! so cool and dramatic!:DDDDDD
what is that thumbnail 💀
Introverts will win this with ease
As an INFP-T, I believe I would easily break that mythical 45 min/1 hr record, lol 😂
cool and dramatic lol
Wow this video was really cool and dramatic
Silence is the loudest sound😳
That looked like a chicken breast at the end though. Just sayin. 😂
I bet I can stay longer than an hour...
The ENT doctor put me in one of those rooms, I’ve heard being in there for too long will drop you to that floor in confusion
I dont know why, but because I live in Minnesota and Minnesota isn’t a very remarkable state, whenever I hear some at least moderately popular YouTuber say “Minnesota” I’m literally like “WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO YAAAHHHHHHHHSSSS S YAAAASSSSS QUEEEEEN SLAAAAAAAAAAY”
Beat 2h I’ve been
Meeeeeehh😮😊😮😢🎉😂😂
wow cool and dramatic
4:40 lmao
wow cool AND dramatic!
wow COOL and dramatic
Your pork chop sure looks like a chicken fillet….🧐
would be different if it was light in the room.
That was a chicken breast.
wow cool AND dramatic
2:14 new meme temp
I’d have my chronic ear ringing to keep me company
i know what this is like too well. i'm am so used to my new place - it has constant traffic noise. i stayed at another place a week ago and i couldn't sleep bc it was so quiet - bc my body was SO loud lol. i could hear the muscles in my head/neck twitching. i thought someone was playing bass in a car nearby or something but there wasn't anything. i only heard it when laying on that side. it was so annoying haha. now i complain less about the traffic noise..
Wow cool and DraMaTiC! 🎉
We've been 100s of feet deep in a Solid Rock Mountain im sure it's somewhere around the same quietness especially in softer rock adits where there is no echo
I just found this - and I notice you have many more subs now than Dr. Phil. Is he your grandpa yet?
At least you didn't pork chop fart in there. Talk about increased a sensations being elevated experience.
Can I sleep in that room forever? lol.
Deaf person could break that record without breaking a sweat
sad
drop any parent in there - they will be ready to pay for a subscription
Wow cool and dramatic
I would love to be in this room for a test - would be my best nights sleep.
I’ve been in a quieter room. I had to do a low volt job for skunkworks in there radio equipment test room. It’s a 4 story tall cube like room built to have absolutely zero reflection of any kind. The cones that covered the walls are six feet tall and cover the entire room. It’s huge! And insanely weird to be inside of. We’re used to echos in a room that big, but you couldn’t even hear yourself accept for the vibrations of your vocal cords radiating through your body to your ears. It feels like you’re underwater. Talking to people was nearly impossible, because it was so hard to hold a conversation when you’re hearing yourself like that. I had to work in that thing for about 48 hours. Definitely felt weird after..
Howdy          ;)
Saw this thumb and I just presumed you don’t have kids. I could probably be in total silence for a VERY long time. 3 young boys makes silence bliss
Wow! So cool and dramatic 🤥
Congratulations!  I guess for your next challenge, you'll be watching paint dry?
Nah. I get the feeling that once you leave, everything sounds *extremely* lod because of how quiet it was.
looks like a horror film
That sad that you don’t have a grandpa so let’s get you to past dr.phill🎉 you make me get though the day Ryan
Sooo cool and drmsdic😅
This is like being in a room with no lights on.
This seems awful
Noice
It
put me in there that seems like heaven
That's amazing
Let me tell you the future Ryan Dr. Phil says yes to you but only if you say if you want to be my grandson just say it told me yesterday so just say it
So I'm confused. IS HD allowed to talk ( to himself) if so just sing , hum, and rap for 45 minutes.
This video was so dramatic! Very cool…
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Yes Ryan
I can’t stand the sounds of a heart beating, or feeling my heart beat. This room would be too much for me
Wow, I don’t know what is more impressive, being in the worlds quietest room for 1 hour or literally sitting in a chair doing nothing for an hour straight
Because of the lights not being on, it’s similar to sensory deprivation
Wow so cool and dramatic the worlds loudest room is so overrated 😂😂😂
This makes no sense......pretty sure a deaf person could beat this record.
You may just have ADHD, you may br an extrovert or insane to not last in that room. Just go to sleep, geez.
Nice try to make an interesting content out of nothing. 45 minutes to sit in a quiet room... Wow you are a hero!
Why do the lights needs to be off? That's what would drive me insane because I'm claustrophobic. But if i could have a light on, i get you would probably hear the buzzing if the electricity but still the darkness is probably what would get me more than the quietness
Woah!!!! This was so cool! You were super dramatic bro!
Just have a nap and break a world record.
wow cool AND dramatic!! 2:14
well, the record is at least an hour now...
wow cool AND dramatic :D !!!!
This was cool and dramatic.
bahahaha, man bro, it's a bit sad that you can't sit still and quiet. a proper sensory depravation float is 90 mins, so like your not even halfway to something lots of ppl (myself included) really enjoy.
I'm going to say, I could probably beat that. I do that sort of thing for fun. Meditate and listen to the odd sounds of my body and things around me. Listen to people breathe. My longest stint without movement is an hour and a half. No movement except inhalation and exhalation.
My cockatoo delivers 130 to 150 db 😂
Bro I have to sit in a dead quiet room for 3hrs while taking my electricians exam in order to keep my license every 3 years. So your 45min stint is a joke!
This dude decided to cosplay Guantanamo prisoner
IT WAS CHICKEN AT THE END. How couldn't you find pork chop?
What is so difficult in staying in this room? These WRs are bullcrap...
Perfect room for sleeping. I wish I had one
Being in the window treatment business. I insulated and upholstered all the walls in our MBR. It was amazing. When people would enter the room, some of them would get a weird sensation. Some would gasp, some would just stop and listen. Some even got dizzy. It was fun to bring people up there just to watch their reaction
you are not a healthy human if you cannot handle a quiet room. i could spend all day in there and be just fine so could any monk
Please just tell me this is cool and dramatic. Well, you've got nice nose hair.
As someone who has tinnitus, this would be a literal level of hell to be in. Because the quieter it is the worse it becomes.
Maybe I could finally fucking sleep in there
I could sit in this room for at least four hours. Five if someone's willing to pay me $100,000 to do it.
So glad i skipped most of it, how boring lol
It was cool, and also very dramatic.
American meditation lol
that room would be perfect for sleeping in lol
You have the record in my book 👏 great job 👍
You talk too much man.
Maybe try not talking or bringing your phone in there to keep you distracted...I dare you. You did this wrong. I would make you look like an infant crying for his mommy if I did this challenge. You don't know insanity. This video is actually insulting to people who actually have major head issues.
You're a normal, average person...now..if you put a lunatic in there, he will feel right at home and just start laughing like the madman that he is at the blankness around him 🤣
How is this hard..? Very dramatic indeed.
I can stay in there forever.
Wow cool AND dramatic!
Going into a quiet room - only to talk all the time in the quiet room - probably doesn't make it a quiet room
I made one of these at Bradford university and as you slowly close off all the flat surfaces you start losing your balance. We also had to use contact adhesive to stick the velcro strips to make the spike tiles interchangeable, so we were high on glue, but the way it messed with you after a while was spooky! Not the glue. That was just like being 17 again?
I have tinnitus so there’s no such thing as quiet. I’d last days.
I can actually stay in this room for hours yes I mean hours I love my peace
Personally, I MUST have some sound (like a fan) being generated or I can not sleep.
You are so much like me. Thanks for realising I hate myself.
Your  a fraud...ask YES THEROY..da..or Doh..ignoramus..
I'll do 24h
Wow Ryan, so cool and dramatic ❤
I would sleep like 8 hrs
Looked like chicken.
I’m full deaf I don’t hear at all literally I have permanent quietest life since 1994 so I win
Only a yogi can survived this room...one who does meditation for years..in india there are many who live in high mountains caves..
Wow this is so cool and dramatic😂
wow! this vide0 was really COOL and dramatic
please i sit inside my apartment with the lights off for more then 40 minutes and i havent gone crazy .
What was just looks scary it's awesome movie creepy
crazy? I was crazy once
Wow cool
Honestly, I would just sleep on the ground
If you go in there really tired, could you just sleep for 2 hours?  :)  Also, I'd love to know what negative decibels mean.  How can you have less than no sound? :)
Omg I thought this was an avengers movie! So cool and dramatic
That pork chop looked pretty dry tbh 👀
No wonder you don’t like your dad’s pork chops because he’s been serving you chicken breasts.
SO COOL AND DRAMATIC BTW
WOW so cool and Dramatic😱
At the start FR JUST FR
Wonderful! Now I can beat your record for 1 hour
Your not the only one who never had a grandfather:)
Love how cool and dramatic this video was
I just stumbled upon your channel and I'm obsessed. Your humor is absolutely adorable and witty. I love it
When your in detention:
Wow, cool & dramatic 😄
Now you have to do the world's normalest room
Love your videos, Ryan🤠🤠
why does he start sounding like tom holland spiderman?
Wow cool and dramatic!!!!
It was like asmr haha 😂
I’m willing to spend the weekend in there because I love peace and quiet, especially in the dark. Helps me sleep more often.
Wow cool and dramatic!!!
Cool! Dramatic! It's been years since I had an A&W rootbeer.
-9 decibels jeeezzzzz sheeesh
✨wow so cool and dramatic✨
So cool and dramatic!!
wow so cool and dramatic. happy now?
Wow cool and dramatic :(
I’m 100% sure I can beat the world record
POV: You said a joke in class
Even at tbe time of this video release, the recod is 55 minutes!
He did this for 1 year and i posted this today lol🙂
but that's chicken
Not impressed. I've spent plenty of time working in anechoic chambers. After a while you get used to it.
WOW THIS IS SO COOL AND DRAMATIC
I subscribed bro
I hope you are able to make it ,I believe in you 🎧🤷🔈
Can a deaf person take the challenge?
That was so look cool a dramatic
I would definitely go there on my day off 🙃
wow cool AND dramatic
Elevated.
Wow… so un- awesome and dramatic! Just kidding great vid!😂🎉
Pork chop? Thats a chicken breast (at the end…)
As an introvert, 30 mins sounds easy 😁
This is what happens to the night gard in fnaf when the power goes out😅😅
"wow cool AND dramatic!!"
Taylor Swift concert 1 thousand decibles
Bull 💩??
"wow cool AND dramatic!!" :)
Yo Ryan, a hurricane is hitting me tomorrow, wish me luck! 🌀
Wow cool
"... I have the perspective ... that I am the experience." How very meta, Ryan! Transcendental!
OMG, the world's loudest room to a person with misphonia or Sensory Perception Disorder. I talking about people who find shopping at Wal*Mart - during off-peak hours - as too stimulating and loud for them to stay longer than ten minutes. I bet they shudder just thinking about it! I am hard of hearing, but loud noises (especially sudden) still hurt my ears. No!
My tinnitus would hate that room lol
I wonder if the world’s quietest room would have a different affect on someone with tinnitus. If you have tinnitus nothing is ever quiet so I don’t think you would really be able to hear your body noises like someone with perfect hearing.
this is cool and dramatic
Turns out: senses are cool AF. Life is to be experiences, tasting cake, hearing Queen, swimming in the glory of you own everyday mundane beautiful everything.
Good luck
Wow this is so cool and dramatic
as a introvert this seems really easy
who cares.  sorry you couldn't hear anything, that would upset you.  That's mostly what the world wants.   try this experiment with an older, calm person, who could just sleep.  or is that one of the things one can't do?  would that be cheating?   hope you get all your money from stupid shit on youtube
Callus doing it for 4 hours is amazing. Not this 😂
Chicken breast.
After someone yells food fight
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Wow 45 mins, I’ll stay for a week, someone pay me
Any room can be quiet if you don't move make it sound or turn on a TV phone tablet or any of that if you spin in silence you will be more annoyed so never ever stay in a quiet room
this is beatuiful and traumatic!
This would be perfect for meditation
wow cool AND dramatic!!
You passed drphil
How do you not hear the electricity in your mic?
😇
WOW cool and dramatic shots!
Wow, cool AND dramatic! :D
“Wow cool AND dramatic” :(
What’s irritating is that u said games begin now but kept talking
Why do u look so creepy LOL
I would make fart noises
Is it against the rules to take a nap in there? Cuz I feel like I could do that.
I have tinnitus so I can handle it.
wow! this video was really cool and dramatic
Did you get a grandpa
Wow cool AND dramatic :(
Wow, cool and dramatic
wow cool and dramatic
the worlds quietest room is actually the kitchen at midnight when i want a snack
Wow this is cool and dramatic 😢🔫😊
Best place for sleep
Wow
why dark? Why isn't it only quiet?
wow cool and dramatic
Wow cool and dramatic
Wow cool and DRAMATIC
I wonder how deaf people can survive mentally without hearing anything 24/7
wow cool AND dramatic!!!!
It wasn't cool and dramatic 😅
I beat the record before any one did
This is so cool and dramatic🎉🎉🎉🎉
The room when I tell a joke :
The ringing in bros ears must be crazy😢
Omg Ryan, this vid was so cool and dramatic it gave me chills!!
Crazy? I was crazy once. They put me in a room. A rubber room. A rubber room with rats. And rats make me crazy
That’s a piece of cake since I am deaf.
Yo those were awesome and dramatic shots dude
bro was more cracky then a glow stick
I love sitting in silence, it really calms me down. It’s hard for me to imagine how people can live without silence, like being constantly surrounded by some kind of noises, but by choice. When I come back home after work silence is like heaven for me.
I Heard That Too 2:35
Those shorts where cool and dramatic
wow cool AND dramatic
Nice
Peace campaign campaign for peace
You just earned tourself a new sub! :Edit thsm for the likes! Ive never had this much before! God bless you guys!
You can also hear your heartbeats after you run a lot for some reason.
Was that porkchop good cause it looked good
This is deep. I like what Steve said, you get to appreciate more things, food etc in a quiet room more than in a bar/noisy one.
Omygosh. I really want to experience this room.
Man wow this is so cool and dramatic
Why be in the dark though? I definitely would have taken the opportunity to meditate and nap.
i was laying on my left side and my stomach grumbled the same time as his
Wow cool and dramatic
hi
I'd just sing praise songs until someone came and got me
Could you imagine the next level sleep you can get in there😊
When he stopped talking i got a chill down my spine

I have heard all of these noises that you hear when you are in complete silence a lot earlier than Steve said
This was cool and dramatic
Did you meet dr phil? Def way passed😂
Never let them know your next move.....*goes to sleep*
What happens if you talk in quiet room?
wow so cool AND dramaric
Since I have nctophobia/fear of dark if I would be there since it's dark I would freak out and I hate hallucinating
Deaf people 👁👄👁
This is like the Russian sleep experiment
Deaf people: I see this as an absolute win
Who else has been watching since before the penny series?
wow cool and "dramatic" :( =(
People that are deaf: I see this as an absolute win!
wow. cool and epic
wow cool and dramatic! :)
Hah noob callus did 4 hours
is docter phil your grandpa yet
Wow COOL AND DRAMATIC
wow COOL and dramatic
As a person who has some sort of mild tinnitus, I would proly go crazy after 10 minutes in this room. After all, its just about your mind, if you can control your thoughts, you can stay there for days... I would like to try meditation in this room and maybe I would be able to handle all the noises from my body 😂
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Where it at I want to go please and thank you
I’d fail immediately, I’d be asleep so fast.
A good idea of how hell is
wow so cool and dramatic!
Love this guys mushroom haircut, he's gotta be the only you tuber with that look. Original
Sounds exactly like etihad stadium
I'd love to have ago in there.   No bloody pings from a phone!   Just for an hour.
So, is Ryan now Daredevil?
Having the room completely dark makes it way different from just being in a super quiet place.
and my chest fills tighter then a camels but in a sand storm hahahahaha sorry if thats aensiv
Thats what I need for prayer time.  No way to get distracted, dark & quiet.  I may have to make a room at the house like this ;)
Wow cool AND dramatic!!
wow cool AND dramatic!
This was cool and dramatic
That pork chop looked very chicken bresty
wow!! cool and dramatic!!!
i can do that easy. what a crock.
wow, cool AND dramatic!
its quiet so howdy..?
... This seems *incredibly* easy.
That looked like a chicken breast
Not bad.  I once went on a boat for three minutes.  Which is impressive
The heaven for people with misophonia.
It was cool and dramatic ❤
Just sleep and you can past an hour like 3hours I don't know
There is no silent room for me ‘cause I have tinnitus 😅😂
This will be the Laudest  room for people with tinnitus
Now do it without talking.
this would be heaven for me lol
But deaf people also can't hear those crazy noises so
i love the effort u put into this vedio
This is a moms dream.
I couldn't. The ringing in my ears would drive me insane..
Ahoy!  Popped up on my recommend videos, and all I have to say is chill, and theatrical...wait that's not it.
The world record is 55 minutes mate
funny
You're not supposed to lay on your left side because you're putting pressure on your heart.
This was both the most boring and the most interesting video at the same time.
very easy!

wow cool and dramatic 😊
The room when I tell a joke:
I wanna fall asleep in that room
This is going to make me throw up....
I have tinnitus so I guess nothing is quiet.
I would like to try this
Why😂
That's a heaven for people who do meditation. 👁️👄👁️
Good for those who do yoga 😂
Dude for your sake I hope you were joking about Dr. Phil. You know that he is a shady creep and a fraud who lost his license to practice psychology right? Look into it.
cool and dramatic!
Do any parents claim that you are their child? 😂😂😂😂❤❤❤
30 minutes in quiet will drive people insane but the deaf are fine?
Can't one spend time singing and stuff to survive longer? I think I would just love that room because I miss total silence, though body sounds get louder there.
Man I think I could do that but also am afraid of silence so I would go crazy after 5 seconds
this is easy to break. just put a very introverted person there. easily one hour past.
Put me in, coach
You think 30 minutes is hard try 9 months.
I wear earplugs to sleep every night. Love the way my body sounds from the inside.
Survived it? I live with 5 people. I’d move into that room for a month on vacation.
Introverts can hack this no cap
I am deaf, and you have no idea. anyways
So what is the meaning of life ?
Looks ez. I can double his time. Who dares me?
I doesn't count as a world record, you were talking and doing noises all the time
This is what it feels like when you always have a fan on and then you loose power for a night lol
wow cool and dramatic
yooo ryan! heads up - it's very much time to reach out to doctor phil again 😁😁😁😁
I’d fall asleep immediately. Dark and quiet is where I thrive
Sh*t, I can last 48 days. That seem like heaven to me LoL. I absolutely HATE being around people and I go forever without company or hanging out woth anyone. It's been years since I've had someone come to hang out. Unless it's a girlfriend or something.
Wouldn’t you just take a nap for 45-60 minutes?
Just go blacked out drunk lol
I'm pretty sure I could break that record by many hours. I would flush benzo's with booze and take a very long nap.
Wow cool and dramatic 2:32
I want live in this room in my country the people is very crazy and noise.
I'm completely deaf.. so... where do I sign up?
so cool and dramatic, it was so exiting to watch this
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Wow, Cool and very dramatic!!
BS, been in a deprivation tank, many times, no sound, does mental health good. As for loudest, you're not enough close, try a fishtank in prison on a Saturday night, one of our college people tested it at 186db and when the shotgun went off on an inmate, you couldn't hear the shot.
i did
@JHSpedals
FORCES us to recognize who we are. Who all of us are! 🤯
i wouldve went to sleep😭😭
young americans and their distaste for their own bodies: a true mental illness
that's cheating.  They're making people crazy by a combination of no sound and no light. Turn the lights on, read a book and it won't be unbearable
It’s not the silence, that’s just what happens if you take the iPhone away from millennials.
I'm really wanna see his comment here
As a person whose family member snores super loud, I'd love to go in and experience
If you could set a timer, it would be a lot easier but would still be really hard. I could probably only do 5 mins
Lol
wow cool and dramatic!
this video was so cool and dramatic ! love it
coooorny jokes
wow cool AND dramatic!!
I would easily beat that whilst doing a mckenna dose
overthinkers can sit here silently for long hours!!!
Wow so cool and dramatic fr 💀
This was lame since you had several cameras and it completely ruined the experiment.  And all those never ending jokes feel like you and your viewers have ADHD and cannot focus on anything even for a minute.
4:40 👁👄👁 hUh
Horor
I would immediately start singing or fall asleep straight up lol
wow cool AND dramatic
omgggg this is so cool and epic

Wow cool
❤
Theres a reason they say "silence is deafening".   It literally hurts my ears
My box fan is my best friend.....my life 😑🙏🏻
It only really works if you’re actually silent and don’t speak every few seconds. Let the room take it effect on you, actually sit in silence then you can say it’s a world record.
wow cool AND dramatic!! love your vids by the way
Wow! So cool and dramatic!
wow, cool AND dramatic
wow cool AND dramatic! :)
"wow cool AND dramatic"

Wow this was cool and dramatic
As the loud kid this is hell
I wood hate it to much
If you have ocd you can stay there for hours without even trying
Even if you put me in this room for a day, I still would be mentally stable
Ryan :“They say if you lay on your left side digestion can actually occur more efficiently” Me: I’m laying on my left side eating among us shaped basketballs rn 😮
RYAN TRAHAN!
Pork chop🎉
This is what teachers expect when she tells you to be quiet LOL
I worked at disk drive manufacturer in the USA. They has just such as room to measure how loud a disk drive was that was being developed. They did all kinds of analysis on various aspects including the bearings and lubes used. Lot of scientific equipment. Of course I'm talking mechical drives not SSD. So the worlds quietist room? Industry uses rooms like that all the time.
doesn't count since you were making noises to distract you from hearing yourself thinking
Is doctor Phil you grandpa now 😮 you have 12 million subscribers
wow and cool
Deaf kid joins the chat with a record of 100+ hours.
It’s like noise cancellation
I would love to sleep 💤😴 there
Doubt it, my tinnitus will keep sound for me.
I could sleep 16hrs in there no problem
He did it lol 🇳🇴
I live in minasota
Imagine farting in there
This is what Squidward always wanted.
i would be begging for that room because i cant stand loud noises i'm like the death angel's from the quiet place I ABSOLUTLY HATE SOUND
This video reminded me of how hopeless gen Z is.
Lmfaooo the dr.Phil part made me follow you are hilarious 😂😂😂

Cool and dramatic
"wow cool AND dramatic!!"
wow cool AND dramatic!!
I know how to beat this. Put a deaf person in there.
“My chest is tighter than a camels bottom in a sand storm made me explode in lafter
Idk the big issue with this? It’s just peace an quiet.
Well when I'm all alone in the house all the neighborhood cars make it heard that they're leaving. Then it's really quiet.
Raú ari u raian tráhan iu okei ?
I could spend days in there. I would enjoy it.... Quietness is my best friend.
It was cool and dramatic
Would love to do shrooms in that room
Is the lying on ur left side fact true!? Bc that’s my usual sleeping position
they need to start building these places everywhere i wanna go inside one too lol
But why it had to be dark 😂
Wow that shot was very cool and dramatic
5:09
wow so cool and dramic
wow cool AND dramatic!!
What you said at 5:22 is actually a very deep thought, a lot of people really don’t understand that!
To easy.
This is what I experience every time I sleep, and I survive that for hours
This is difficult for outgoing people and people who can't go without electronics for too long. This would be nothing to me
Haven't finished the video yet but I'm guessing you start hearing the sounds of your own internal organs shifting around.
Cool and dramatic bud 👍🏻
this was cool and dramatic
This guy must not have kids I'd love this room lol
This was cool and dramatic
I can stay for at least 1 hour or more
Wow cool and dramatic!
👀
I could do it no problem 100% easy 😏
If they are paint the room in vantablack, hehehe, I wondering if someone can stand still
Weird sensory deprivation tank where you float on body temp water and epsom salt ( magnesium ) doesn’t have the same effect.
To an Introvert like me this would be Heaven.
Extrovert: this silence room is a nightmare!! Introvert: (Nice)...
0:22 did that bring anyone back to gundam wing?
One advantage of having tinnitus is that there is no such thing as a "silent room".  I'd do fine in there.
Ryan your my favorite Youtuber
I mean, I would just take a good nap
Subscribe for dr phill
So cool and dramatic
Who do I phone to book it for a night?
very cool and dramatic
i'd sleep in there.
Wow this was so cool and dramatic…
Everytime you opened your mouth the timer should have reset.
Joke on you, I’m deaf I will last much longer
Survived? Was the room made of spikes and full of snakes or something... Survived LOL.
exactly, you are not "having" an experience, you "are" the experience
I'd enjoy it.
No room is quiet with my tinnitus.
Did you get in contact with Dr Phil 12.1 million.
Once I was in Audi’s quiet room. It was awesome! I wanted to stay in it for a couple of days but they were not into it. 😅
OMG... you survived the world's quietest room like the other thousands of yotubers who survived the world's quietest room.
I have tinnitus, I would like to give this room a go...  ...but at the same time, I am afraid that if I delve into the sound of my tinnitus, I might have a panic attack in there!
Wow dude the size of your pupils in the dark was cool and dramatic! 😊
You clickbaited us! XD
Man I got tinnitus,  there is no such thing as a quiet room for me. I would pay for a days quite. Utter silence would be like a dream come true. He'll I'd even watch another one of your terrible videos if it ment I could get rid of this bloody tinnitus! ! !
"i felt like i was becomming an off brand avenger because my hearing was above average" DareDevil : "am i a joke to you ?"
Imagine this plus a sensory deprivation tank… you’d be on another galaxy frfr
Well you can’t actually go insane in there as all deaf people who lost their hearing somewhere during their life are perfectly sane.
Basically me everytime I take my hearing aids out to sleep 😅
There is no such thing as "silence drives you crazy"...  Are all deaf people are crazy?!...
8------------>
i want to go there and meditate. just really take in everything to the most tiny of details.
Lol just give me a couple Tylenol pm’s and melatonin and if crush that record.
Now we know how difficult is to be silent for 30 mins !!
I always said if I can stay on the moon alone  I would be the most happiest person.
Who doesn't want a nice quiet room.
That was cool and dramatic keep up the great work.
Was that pork chop a chicken breast?
I'm concerned that this man thinks poop is a "meat-like substance".
I have pretty bad tinnitus, I can barely stand a regular quiet room. Even if I can hear cars driving by in the distance and a TV on in the other room, I still go a little mad.
Wait, there's world record for being in an anechoic chamber?  I used to design reference monitors for the recording industry and spent hours for days on in insdide an anechoic chamber.  I'll admit the first time walking into one is an experience to remember.
wow, cool AND dramatic!!
Stupid. Not torture at all grow a pair
realy cool and dramatic
Anechoic Chamber.
Sign me up. I got to use a sensory deprivation chamber for a college experiment. Most relaxed I've ever been. Even now it's hard to sleep without earplugs and a black t shirt over my face.
Your breath kicking was really funny! That one won you a like.
Imagine ripping a wet fart in thwre
There's nothing around me to experience, so I had the perspective that I AM the experience.  Sensory deprivation will absolutely produce this kind of realization.  Cheaper and safer than hard drugs to just go into a proper sound treated room lol
Wow cool and dramatic
That looks like an easy record to break
*wow cool AND dramatic!!*
Wow so cool and dramatuc
"wow cool AND dramatic!!" :(
Hmmm, I wonder what it is like for def
This would be HEAVEN for me. All I'd need is a pillow and a blanket, wake me up in 8 hours.
WOW THIS IS SO COOL AND DRAMATIC!!
*This World's Quietest Room Is Perfect For Me Because I Can Sleep All Day*
I would just go in there to meditate.  Easy way to pass the time.
Jokes on you, I have tinnitus. When it's quiet, my ringing in my ears is more noticeable.
And all of those culminated to a pork chop. Amazing.
In order to experience the complete effect...BE QUIET AND DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
I have Tinnitus.. it would be nice to experience quiet for once lol
Put a toilet in there and you'd have to drag me out.
This would be amazing for me =)
i could do 1 hour with ease
They should make it completely dark as well
Bro I‘d be going insane
“The world is quiet here”        -Lemony Snicket
I think people freak out more so because they don't have their phone for 30 minutes ....
Why did it need to be dark? It was for sound not light. That's two fold deficit
Just go to sleep
Secret hack - spend a few years in the field artillery and there's never a silent room again!
wow cool And dramatic!!
Cool and dramatic
I love it ,great thinking
Try to stay there 1 day and see if you get crasy 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best place to nap lol
this was so cool and dramatic
i would be taking a nap like 7 seconds in.
I could do hour or two easy in there. I think the "record" is made-up.
This room seems interesting. I myself like being alone at times. And I can’t count how many times I’ve just laid on my bed in my room, and it is completely silent (aside from the occasional sneeze of one of my dogs, or the rapid flapping of their ears when they shake their heads from downstairs).   I’d imagine this place would be on a whole other level! If I didn’t want total silence for too long, I’d bring my iPhone to listen to some soft instrumental music, or my acoustic guitar to play some chords (which I imagine would be pretty weird with walls that deflect/absorb sonic vibrations).
I would need a pee jar, but aside from that I see no reason for much of a time limit.
this does not seem like it would be difficult at all.
Arent you allowed to read a book or sleep? If you are supposed to sit still and not do anything, most gen z wont survive 5 minutes in a normal room
You sat & stayed longer than I could..Good luck with the Doc Phil thing..☮️
I would deal with it by laying down and going to sleep. I work my ass off and am bombarded by noise constantly, it would be sweet relief. My basement is that way, its concrete including the top, and when you go down there its like going into a tomb. there is so much steel reinforcing in the concrete, that cell phone signal cuts as soon as you go in, so no emf pollution on you either.
I would absolutely love total sensory deprivation for like 8 hours every night.
Spoiled ass kid. Your parents sent your way out there to make your YouTube
Cake work💯
This seems terrifying, yet oddly satisfying at the same time. I hate too much noise, anyway. I would love to try this. I have heard my own blood flowing through my ears many times at random when laying down and it didn't freak me out.
Wow so cool and dramatic 🔥🔥😱😱🔥🔥😱😱
I would immediately start a long fap sesh
Yeah. Weird that some people consider this a challenge. More like this sounds like a perfect place to be alone with your thoughts for a change.
the pork chops comment. lmao
As a mom of 3, I would give a less useful limb to sit in this room for a day...
i thought this guy died in a car crash years ago.
At -9db, sound stops before you even finish talking😮
I have tinnitus..so it's never completely quiet. I could last in that room a long time
Where do I sign up to stay in this room.. can you bring it to my house 😂
Acting 😅😅 all for the internet
Do u know how extremely easy that would've been for you to destroy that record if you had only prayed a few rosaries, a divine mercy, just prayed.  I can pray for long periods totally shutting everything else out and it is so peaceful.  Plus you would've come out with a closer relationship to God.  Maybe next time.
I need a good 8hrs a night in this thing.😂
It’s kiss😮
This may be hard for normal but for someone who enjoys the isolation and quite.
12.1 million subscribers, did he adopt you?
Niceee! And also... Cool AND epic
I'm willing to beat the record. I'll give it a shot. I say 2 hour's easy. If I can stay awake. Can you sleep? Or do you have to stay awake?
I'd fall asleep 😜
Dr Phil is a ducking simp!
The room is not crazy. Ffs. I worked in quiet rooms. Stayed there for a long period of time. Didn't go crazy
I would finally have a full blown conversation with my depression and then pick a fight with them.
you beat dr phil congradulations
but, but...that's chicken at the end
Son, you have no idea what tinnitus is.
You were so so FUNNY When you're in the quietest room!😂😂😂😂😂
damn
I really want to try it but..............
The police  cell is actually the same the difference is that you have the noises that you don't concentrate on.
Would anyone please sponsor me to go to that place, and give me about 10K of your American dollars to break that record!
wow Cool AND Dramatic
Too bad ppl who are on their phones 24/7 could not experience peace & quiet.
I feel like I wasted 8:05 seconds of my life on this.
Why is it such a big deal?
I have really bad tinnitus, I wonder how it would sound to me 😂 Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee…
My OCD wouldn't let me sit there for even a sec, I CAN'T
Wow cool and dramatic!
wow cool and dramatic!!
wow cool AND dramatic!! :(
This is an ASMRtist dream
If I was in this situation, 1. IM TERRIFIED OF EXTREME QUIETNESS, 2. I HAVE PHASMOPHOBIA(and partial fear of the dark) so I would probably have to look at each corner ever 5 seconds. Anyways     “wow cool AND dramatic!!”
Wow cool AND dramatic!!
1:51 is the Marvel character Daredevil who’s superpower is to hear extremely well. 😂
This looks fucking retarded
wow cool and dramatic
the video  is not dramatic and cool -+
super
6:47 how can a cave man named Muhammad know this 1400 years ago? There’s much more to it as well.
*pork chop noises*...lol!  Jack Burton approves.
I would have loved having a quiet place.  Now that I have tinnitus that would make me crazy.  Outside noise seems to help lower the ringing.  The quieter it is the louder the ringing.  Some days I just can't stand it. I can't believe there isn't a cure for it. 😢
Do some DMT in there
I like silence, i want to try it
I'll always have my tinnitus to keep me company.
i have tinnitus in both ears so there is never silence for me even in the quietest environments. I could sleep in there
You had me at Doc Phill 😂
I would have to crank one out in there.
Honestly I'd pay to nap for an hour or two in this room
When I go deep into the mountains and away from everyone, I hear ringing in my ears, which really lets me know how loud my usual existence is and how wonderful quiet can be...of course the ringing is barely noticeable and goes away.
I'd pay for that tbh - I think it would be a cathartic thing for me... all I hear is me ,,,, a release and only horrific if it was forever Where can I do this in UK? I think I'd pay for this as I think it could help my external crap by sorting out internal me in a robust way. Seriously is there a UK equivalent?  OR USA company to point us to?  Website?
I'd probably fall asleep.
Is it easy for deaf people though?
3:07 idk why but he kinda sounded like tom Holland to me at that time
Why not have battery-powered LED lights? No noise there!
Why would you want Dr Phil as a grandpa? Lol
I'd love to see how long a senior Buddhist monk could meditate in there.
This room is the best room to sleep. No light no sound !!!
That was the most cool and dramatic video Ive ever seen
wow cool and dramatic
Can you go in with the lights on or does it have to be dark?
I would just nap in there so peacefully, I’m sure I would break the record in there.
Best room to sleep
Rock show at 150db?  nope....do some research.  All of your SPL numbers are complete bogus...its not impressive to lie to your subs.  A rock concert is 100-105db A (stands for A weighted) .... I do them for a living.  I literally have to measure them with Class 1 systems that are legally valid for SPL measurements.  150 db would cause your eardrums to burst....its like standing next to a rocket.  Even if you did dB C or dB SPL your numbers are wildly wrong.
I think I would get hyper-focused on my tinnitus and slowly descend into madness.
The loudest room is my bedroom, at least that’s what the neighbors say
6:47 NOT TRUE.  The stomach empties out to your RIGHT into the duodenum (unless you were born with situs inversus or some similar anatomic anomaly).  Laying on your right side, Mr. Gravity is your friend and will automatically cause stuff in your stomach to drain out into the duodenum even if your stomach is not contracting that much.  If you lay on your left, food will sit in the fundus of the stomach and go nowhere until the stomach contracts and forces it out (against the pull of Mr. Gravity). Also, your esophagus enters your stomach on the LEFT side of the stomach.   So, laying on your left side, Mr. Gravity will pull that food and liquid sitting in the fundus of the stomach back OUT up into your esophagus. So laying on your left side is a great way to increase esophageal reflux (a.k.a., hearburn) and decrease gastric emptying.  I generally lay on my right side when lying down or sleeping.
I would beat the world record due to my severe tinnitus
This is so lame.  41 minutes in a quiet room?  Give me a fucking break.  Any sound proof room is "the world's quietest room"
the realization that you are the experience is a core concept of Buddhism and enlightenment 😂
Why is it have to be dark ?
NIE größeren schwachsinn gesehen. Kein Hirn oder was ?! 🤣
You could have meditated
porkchop probably taste bad because its chicken
My guy
“This room is so quiet!” Youtube:FBREEZE FAPTIFY PLUG
wow cool and dramatic!
Wow so cool AND dramatic!
Would they let you read a book? If so that would be so easy
How come he didn't squint his eyes once the light was turned on? When I've been in the dark for a while and I turn the lights on I can barely open my eyes at first.
I could of done 4 hours
deaf people here we come, excuse me?
5:52 I wonder what have sex would be like in that room.
this has to be the most GEN Z video ive ever seen. all i wanted to see is what its like to be in a room like this without the stupid ass quips, noises, comments, inserts, etc.  instead, this guy couldnt even keep the video quiet so we could possibly hear his heart beat or blood flowing to be picked up by the audio in the mic. his attention span and patience to that of less than a damn goldfish. what a scrub.
quiet
Ryan: 30 minutes will drive you insane  Also Ryan: *stays in room for more than 30 minutes*
I dream of that room. I am one who can stay in for a week and be happy when I come out. It is the shock of the outside after that will be rough
Cool and dramatic
WOW SO COOL AND DRAMATIC
So it’s basically like experiencing tinnitus for the first time, which is traumatic, to say the least.
If I were going to be in the room, I'd want a zero gravity chair to get a further sense of the relaxation. That pork chop looked good.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
I hate that constant sound you hear in your ears when it’s completely silent. I could take sleep meds and sleep in that room though 😂
why wouldn't you survive a quiet room?
Young people can’t stand not having constant stimulus. That’s why he kept talking to himself.   I could live in that room.
Bro what
If Steve told him that this is the most peacefull room in the world and the record is 1 day .he will survive for 2 days.mind game
Then why deaf people are not crazy?
hate to put the Kabash on your "Quietest Room in the World" but every Aerospace company in the world has those rooms and uses them daily for EMI testing.....lol
This is chicken not pork shop xd
Can you walk around?
I can't even sit in a quiet room at home because of tinnitus, I would go insane in a minute maybe 2.
as above as below
So…..this room wouldn’t affect a deaf person, huh?
Something isn't right.  When the light was turned back on, he didn't squint or react at all, which would be impossible with such a sudden burst of light after being in complete darkness for that long.
02:14  this was cool and dramatic  :)
I keep my home as quiet as possible except for when I’m sleeping(small fan of course). It’s normally right at 37db in home at all times except when the HVAC or refrigerator kicks on. No TV no nothing. I love the peace and serenity. The problem is whenever I go out everything seems amplified, especially crap background music in restaurants. That’s the worst.
So, there’s no lighting?  Great room to fall asleep.
The problem is that you are putting an American in the room.  They are very quiet.
Interesting. I am interested to learn why he pasted out if one can be in that room indefinitely?!
I did the same thing in an anechoic chamber at the UofS but I was also in a bath of 37'c 97'f water so I could feel anything aswell after a few mins I felt spiders crawling on me but it was water evaporating off my skin.  I was in for less then 5 mins.
Much ado about NOTHING; move over punk:  in 1975 I was a subject for a college Psych experiment:  floating in a Sensory Deprivation Tank....for 24hr.  I was an under-grad; IF you completed the test period= $150.   I floated in a DARK salt water based tank, no sense of hearing/sight:  just ME....and my Mind.  TRY that shit, rookie.  ps:  I didn't even have any simp subscribers!  Nor give a flying fuck!
I would have took a nap
wouldnt be so quiet if you have any variation of Tinnitus😵‍💫
If I was 30-40 minutes on that chair I would go crazy as well, give me a couch and its heaven!
It's so quiet you can hear Ur blood pumping apparently
Ur vid are so cool and dramatic
Quietness and silence is a gem feeling....
wow cool AND dramatic!!
I have 3 little kids. Where is this room again? 😂 just go to sleep!
How cool and dramatic
41 minute, 😂...I am living from last 3 years.
I could beat that record easy.
But…what about deaf people
work where i work for a  week. it will drive you insane.
Why does it have to be dark to be quiet anyway?
wow! Cool and Dramatic!
Can we sleep? If yes I'm eager to try it!
This documentary is sooo cool and dramatic
the music at the end is literally what my class used for the war scene in our play bruh.
Is Dr. Phil your grandpa now?
😂😂😂
I would literally just fall asleep and wake up 7 hours past the WR
Why could you not just sing to yourself for an hour
Room is very cool. People are weird man, quiet is the best. How is this a feat? Who cares
It's incredible to see people pushing the boundaries and pursuing their dreams. Thank you for sharing this!
Please put me in the worlds quietest room. I value silence
I would just take a nap
Ridiculous.  Try prison segregation when it quiet. It's just as quiet as quiet can get.  Hillarious.  Try survive for weeks in a cell.  PUSSIFIED nation.
Wow cool and dramatic:)
is it just me or does he look like Ben Cook the Actor from Newsies just me ok
That was chicken
Perfect place to meditate
2:14 is cool and dramatic
Introverts :-🗿
I worked in a place with a big freezer & had to go in there sometimes, the freezer was off, & felt like pressure on my ears ! I don't believe this could be quitter, but don't want to try it ! When you closed the sealed door, it got worse !
I can do it for 1 hour. Will you sponsor me?

Cracking your neck is bad for the health

With my ADHD, I'd pass out in there.
Let me in there and I’d stay there forever

Wow it is so dark in there I would be. Terrified
The room is a dream for me   ...Read more

Man, if the room is not too dark, I think I can survive. But otherwise, I cannot cause my brain tricked me into seeing weird things
Can you sleep in there?
Wow cool and dramatic!!!🤠
Loll. Feel this is the best place to record ASMR content 😂😂😂
I read in my school book if you  stay few minutes in these room . you can hear your heart beat and nerves circulation.😱
just go to sleep
Moral of this story : Be quiet and your pork chops will taste better.
just fall asleep
wow cool AND dramatic!!!
Sad
I genuinely don't understand how this would be difficult unless you have tinnitus (like I do). Before my tinnitus set in this year I'd wear foam ear plugs 24/7 because I am about as sensitive to noise as a human can possibly be. I essentially lived in total silence most of my life until last year. Now with tinnitus I genuinely want to kms. Thanks psychiatrist that gave me Wellbutrin. :)
Barbra’s reds room please.
🏓👃💯👺👹🖕
This is probably good for the dirty dozen
Keep me in this room with my books and study material. I can survive my whole life with food and washroom

This is my place!
Spiritually....What's happening is when u aren't going outside, 🔥 U starts going inside & starts hearing sound of your breath, heart-beat. U'll Experience the changes in ur body, this is what happens in Meditation. (It's just 1 aspect of it)  🙏🇮🇳🙏 I wanna Experience it & wanna do Meditation there, i bet it'll level-up 10 times.
I think it's easy to do, but I don't know what He's feeling.

Just sleep buddy

It was cool and dramatic
he broke the record because he keeps making noises. That ain't silent. I can even last a day if that was the rule
Noooo dr Phil is terrible
The silence is too loud
I want this room ,please. I'm tired of loud noises.
this video is very cool and dramatic.
I like pork chop
wow cool AND dramatic! :)
classrooms in the future to deal with school shooters
sounds like heaven to me
still louder than my class after i tell them a joke🥲
I would stay in there for a week
This is so cool and dramatic.🙀
This is legit bullshit. I have been stranded in a car for days living on crums, I bet my life I could spend a week in this room easily.
I could be there at least a day, then I will get hungry.
Pork is haram
I can break that
We all required this type of room for meditation isn't it ...
i can stay hole day
You messed up the experience by talking in the quiet room
I’m used to quiet so I’d probably beat the record… I’m used to ringing, buzzing and whosing in my ears..
Whoa this is so cool and dramatic!
All I can think is what if you took an "heroic dose" of magic mushrooms, went in, turned the lights out and did that? Lol.
Wow! So cool and dramatic!
Hmm very good place for sleeping- imma get mah pillow now
wow cool AND dramatic
wow cool and dramatic
wow cool AND dramatic!!
try surviving the average third grade classroom
ryan you are so ridic-"wow! thats so cool and dramatic!"
I can do an hour in that room easily...
I need this for my sensory overloads
Imagine this with having tinnitus
I have tinnitus. I literally don't know what silence sounds like.
Wow cool and dramatic 😎 😂😅
Wow cool AND DRAMATIC!
The music from "7 vs wild" 😍😍😍😍
WOW this video is so cool, its so shocking of how dramatic it is.
wow how cool and dramatic
MrBeast?🤔
Srry but you annoy me
wow cool AND dramatic!!
This is what blind and deaf people go through!
What's the point of having the worlds quietest room?
wow cool AND dramatic!!
“I have the experience… that I am the experience.”   That’s dope.
WOW, so cool AND dramatic xD
So deaf people can last there
Sounds like it just becomes a mind game
The class when the principal enters the class :
I live by myself, my apartment is completely emptying and it’s very quiet. I spend nearly 8 to 16 hours at home in silence everyday and if you cant do that like i cant then idk wtf your problem is for not handling silence as a virtue
Cheating by making too much noise for youtube content. How about be quiet and do the challenge right. Smh youtubers.
Wow
Bruh.;-)
It’s -100000000DB
was that Two Steps From Hell music at the end of your stay?
I love silence, I'd make this my house.
2:13 wow so cool and dramatic ❤
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Yeah, kind of hard to brag about a 'record' when they're super picky about ever letting anyone use it. If anyone was allowed to go in it, there would be numerous 'record breaks'.
Deaf people: am I a joke to you
I am the experience I like that I'm gonna use that at work
This comment will get pinned.
They should do yoga.. it will be more peaceful
I would like to be there I've been in the darkest room for 10mins but I got crazy there..
I would do 24 hours of this for $100 and a slice of pizza

Every teacher wish in their classroom be like:
I could easily beat you.  I can survive longer than an hour, even 6 hours, or 24 hours.   I would not go mad of sound deprivation.
I've been in one of those rooms before. I lasted like 10 mins and felt weird and bolted. Lol!
7:50 the Survivor sound Lmaoo
wow cool AND dramatic!!
0:14 anyone noticed the sign said he's committed?
I couldn’t do it because I have a right rear that rings very loud. Ugh. I would also hear my bodies fluids and that’s gross!

I could last for days in this room. My bedroom has to have blackout curtains. I have severe tinnitus. So I always hear noise in my ears. Plus, I have adhd… so I have a bunch of things to keep me busy in my head. 🤷‍♀️
Wow this was so cool and dramatic 😱😱😱😱
This is what teacher expect when there gone in classroom

having a tinnitus, that silence room is one of my dream to be inside...NOT!!!!
wow SO COOL AND DRAMATIC
That always happens to me
This morning I was in my room getting dressed singing a tune in my head when I realised how oddly quiet the house was. So I just stopped moving and singing and just listened to the silence. I could hear buzzing noises in my ears instantly. I realised how loud this world is.
wow cool and dramatic

Wow cool AND Dramatic 🙀🙀🙀
Was cool and dramatic❤

Ladies and Gentlemen: the World's record in the quietest room is 41 mins. A deaf person: hold my beer.
Those seens were cool and dramatic
Its giving me anxiety... Am i okay?
The best way to survive is just enjoy the sounds
Biggest crime is him eating pork chops at the dinner table wearing a hat. 🤪
To be honest, I’d love to hear my body’s sounds in a room like this. It’s a little terrifying but I’m just so curious to hear my own heartbeats and details in a way I’d normally not be able to
I wish anybody else could have done this experiment lol I was looking for feedback on the experience not lame jokes lol
45 mins? I could beat that.Easily.
Why were the lights turned off, though? 🤔
wow cool AND dramatic!!
wow cool AND dramatic :))
I think had he remained absolutely silent it would have been much more difficult.
Wow, cool AND dramatic!!
Taylor Swift in 'The Story of Us': I've never heard silence quite this loud! Me: **Sees this video**
At the time of watching this video you’ve surpassed dr.Phil
I've been in silence I've been in the dark locked in the basement for years for hours for days abused as a child.
*coffee noises*
Ryan: Its so dark. Also Ryan: My ears just started making noises *nervous laugh* 🤣You are the best😂

that was soo cool and dramatic
I was once in a similar room. The thing that gets to you is the constant ding noise of complete silence. The best way I can describe it is like a solid flatline and you can hear your thoughts like you're screaming 😱 it's crazy
Will you let me to break the same record???
Quiet kid when they go in there: Finally some peace  Noone:  Loud kid: I think hell has just began
"Sponge Bob I can't hear you its too dark in here!"
I live in Minnesota and it’s kinda cool how you traveled to the state I live in. I honestly  would die in this room I relax deeply with no sounds but I would most likely die.
Deaf people: 🥱🥱 lightwork
I would go in and just sleep for 5 hrs.
the guy who owns the chamber freaked out when he said he got up and walked around in the total darkness in a chamber like this you should not even TOUCH the walls.  If he fell into a wall he would have done thousands of dollars of damage to the chamber
Wow that was so cool
I have a deaf friend who can break any record in that room...
Wow cool and dramatic
Bro.. you made me watch for that ending..
So its november 2022 and you have 11.1 million subs so is Dr Phil your grandad yet
looks like easy to me😌👍
As an introverter this is just heaven for me..!🗿
For those who cannot hear, I have respect for.
creepy
No this room is not just quiet they're probably putting pressure on your body somehow.
Wow cool and dramatic
Wow cool and dramatic
I’d get high as hell in that room
I can sleep here peacefully for hours.
Do you win money 💰 for staying in for 1 hour ???
Living in Wendy ship port , this is a dream come true
when nobody  answers the hardest quetion
It’s weird but I feel like this would make me feel claustrophobic especially bc it’s pitch black in there
wow cool AND dramatic!!
CHALLENGE: How long can you stay in the worlds most quietest room?!  My Deaf Brother Kenneth....  HOLD MY BEER     Wait, NOOOO! Im gunna need that beer,  Ill be in here for a while.
I'd like to give it a shot. I never minded the quiet. When it gets super cold and I turn off the computer, it gets incredibly quiet. It's so quiet that I can hear people going by outside who aren't even going that fast. (The road is a good ways from the house.) I can even sometimes hear my own stomach doing its thing.  There's an odd peace about silence, and being in this room probably wouldn't bother me at all. If anything, I'd probably fall asleep.
I could stay for hours in there hahah I have 3 kids and they don’t stop one second to speak and scream and messy all around the house, I love that, but I’llgive money to sleep in a completely silence and quiet place. Hahaha
Tell me how to sign up for this challenge please🙏🏾
Wow…cool and dramatic 😮
Now do it after consuming 5 dried grams of psilocybin mushrooms.....
Do I get money if I beat the record?
Introverts *yes the quiet place*
SLEEEEEEEEEEP
It's a 2yrds drama
wow cool AND dramatic :]
AKA safest place in a quiet place
So it is also a myth that you’ll win a million dollars if you stay in for an hour.
Such a cool and dramatic Video🔥
**This gonna be a right place to meditate it seems lol😂
Me watching this video with my right ear possibly with an infection because it hurts and i cant hear that well with only that ear

wow cool and dramatic 🙂
2:15 is so cool and dramatic
Wow cool AND dramatic.
My tinnitus boutta make that the worlds loudest room.
I feel like going in there and knowing you need to count to 3600 is easy to focus on and not trip the hell out.
Bruh I had a nightmare like this where I fell into a room with one way windows that I could see ppl out of but they couldn’t see me so I screamed to get there attention and no sound came out of my mouth.
Pork chop at the end looked more like a chicken breast!!!!
wow cool AND dramatic
I want to do this .. I think I would rest on the floor

2:14 wow this is cool AND dramatic ;)
I've been Deaf for a good while now, but still spent most of my life hearing so I understand how it feels. Im very confused by this though. Its a quiet room?
I do stuff like this on a regular bases, 2 hours and 34 minutes I can last like this on my record, I just love it because my body and my brain feel like it's in peace and threre nothing bothering me idk why
I hear those buzzes when there was a power out in my house. I use my drum to remove my buzzes
As someone with a noisy annoying brother this is heaven to me
I'm down to try I got no money to fly out who's paying for it? Dr Phil I mean dude's new Grandpa you going to split the bill with him seriously though it seems more like people's attention span is triggered by not being triggered if that makes sense to you high five if it doesn't good luck
❤❤❤❤
wow cool AND dramatic!!
He has more subs than Dr. Phil now 😂
I… won’t last long… my ears very quickly make ringing sounds… not very quiet… and it’s ringing already… I wonder when they’ll start ringing tonight
i hear fluid in my veins and joints in normal environment, but for studying I'm using over ear plugs and in ear plugs for silence, and that not comfortable, pros and cons. more cons in normal life in this period of humanity.
Has everyone noticed he wears the same thing ever video
What I want after a day school
That was so cool😊

Why did he use a demogorgan
Hey I live in Minnesota!!!
Pretty sure being inside an MRI is one of the loudest experience 🤔 and to have a quiet room like that would be amazing. I can totally sleep / relax with a book.
2:19 was cool and dramatic 🙄😑
How can I try this?
Wow so cool and dramatic
That would drive me nuts because I have tinitis us meeting I always have constant ringing in my ear especially when it’s quiet
I would be stressed of how my farts would sound in there.
Actually the world's quietest room is when i tried to do standup comedy.
wait so is Dr Phil your grandaddy now?
damn this is much cool and v drama
I'm committed to breaking the "record" as well.  I loveeee this
Imagine having sex inside that room, so many weird sounds all around.
Was this Helen kellers life???
Ryan being a cartoon character 2:36
cool
Wow cool and dramatic.
I have misaphonia so this would be amazing
Wooow It Looks Cool Its Making Me Feel Dramatic Rn Fr
The reason it’s only 41 minutes is because only 1 person did it and they had to leave early for a restraint booking. It’s not that hard to stay in a room that’s completely silent
WOW SO COOL AND DRAMATIC
Ahora haz el test de sobrevivir media hora picando piedra. Eso seguro que no lo consigues. Se te ve...
How does it feel to be in the world record that people don't know they are stupid IM JOKING IM JOKING DONT HATE ME
You looks like casey nash
Omg! Give us an update on being adopted by Dr Phil
title:i survived the world's quietest room thumbnail:He is covering his ears
7:51 HE IS COMMITTING HARAM STOP HIM!
I've had tinnitus for over 6 years, so I think this room would be a breeze for me.
Yo
wow so cool and dramatic
great job
That was cool and dramatic
Wow cool
Wow cool and dramatic!     As you requested 😝
Provided that I have the proper clothing (suitable for the temperature in this room), I bet ANY amount of money that I will "emerge" in SIX hours and be equally happy as if I had spent that time with Claudia Schiffer (so to speak). Of course, no gadgets whatsoever.
wow cool AND epic!!
Wow cool and dramatic
I wanna experience this
Wish to see all the world leaders sitting here for a while. Maybe the world maybe at peace
That was cool and dramatic but your eyes were freaking me out.
wow cool AND dramatic!! but in all seriousness you make me laugh everytime I watch you, subscribe!
I ko just go and take a nap
Ne
Of you sleep in the room you can easily beat the world record
You have surpassed Dr. Phil's YT subs - will he adopt you now??
if it is me i can be for at least an hour and i would like to do it some day
This is hell for tinnitus sufferes like me
Everyone saying they’d just love this, you’d only love it for a short time. You’re thinking of “quiet” as “peaceful” not “quiet” as “solitary confinement”.   My bet is every person saying this would love to be alone in the forest - where it’s “quiet” - except for the wind through the trees, leaves rustling, small animals, rushing water, and other such sounds that would not be present in this room. I’d bet everyone would enjoy the sort of environment I just described but that would be a far cry from this room.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
7:27 Lies.
2:46 My ears are always make noises.
Take me to there. I am not everyone.
among us is sus
सिद्धांत रूप में खराब सामग्री नहीं
mfw i can hear my ears and joints 24/7 💀
TLDW: it's like wearing in ears
I know I’m watching this like a year late but, you beat dr. Phil! 🎉
I wanna fall a sleep in that room
I think that actually feels relaxing
No I can definitely do this
I can do this
Looks like you didn't make "any" kind of record since you KEEP TALKING!!
i would LOVE this room. id sleep so well in it. However. there is one thing that would make this a miserable experience for me. My right ear has a constant ringing from a previous infection and silence is often screechingly loud in my right ear. My brain has learned to filter it out most of the time, just not when it is silent.
wow cool AND dramatic!! (Totally not being sarcastic)
I'M TRYING MY BEST TO COPE WITH THE STRANGEST THING I EVER MET..
Overrated stunt
this is cool and dramatic LOL
I could trash that record in my sleep!
This was so cool and dramatic
really good
I can stay at there 1 hour. Easy for the person who like silence and being alone. If you don't believe just give me round tickets and enough money to do that.
Deaf people : hold my glass
YOOOOOOO 😂😂 You got me!!!!! @7min & 35seconds 🤣 I’m crying
autistic people like me would love to live in the room
The record goes to the camera man too
it is a large pile of ??? Spent 45 min in ATT anechoic chamber...no issues...heard heart beat, etc. seems depends on individual's fear of unknown or things different.
Why cant they just meditate in there?
This was epic and cool
41 is fucking nothing lmao
You know i could probably spend hours in there. You know why? I WOULD JUST FALL ASLEEP!
Cool !!    ......and Dramatic.
this is pretty cool and dramatic
I'd survive that for a year...   "Those who know themselves, have no demons, can align with their highers selves and can master their minds, Don not  not need noise or the distractions of the world to fill the void. They are at peace, and will be at one with silence. "        - OKH
I read is 200 dollars per person with a 400 dollars minimum? So 2 people?
Okay fadher...
This is what teachers expect the cafeteria to be like in our school.

Challenge accepted,  I can beat the world record
I have severe tinnitus from being Artillery in the military. I have loud ringing in my ears at all times. I can only imagine how amplified it would be in there. Great job on the video!
Ryans next vid is "I Survived space and time" 🤣🤣
"wow cool AND dramatic"
Amateur. At this place I can spend long time. Anyway, congrats for the achievement. It's not easy in present with all the social bull$h17.
That room would be a lot more quiet if it wasn't next door to the noisiest room.
What if you fell asleep while being in that room? The time you sleep counts too? I would stay there for hours if that's the case.
Would love to spend  few days in this paradise
This is total crap because maybe I'm different but I love total quite
Wow! So cool and dramatic!
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Just a heads up 150db would literally burst you ear drums immediately!
My biggest nightmare would be getting locked in this room and not being able to get out! FUCK!
Wow cool AND dramatic !
I don’t think you realize how lucky you are to be in the worlds quietest room unless you’re someone who doesn’t know how to meditate.
2:18 it was cool and dramatic
Me being scared of silence in the room...meanwhile my brain to me "I am your dj tonight"😂
LOBILLOS MUSICAL DE DURANGO.
It's quite normal for me. I wonder how come there is a world record for this 🤣?
cool!
wow, cool and dramatic ;>
Helen Keller passed her whole life in this situation and we normal people cannot even spend a few hours.... salute to that women!
I spent a night in a cave.  The ear thing happens.  You hear your digestive system.  When you roll in your sleeping bag it sounds like a paper bag.  Any noise beyond that is quite startling.  You can sleep but it takes quite a while an not that well.
Well, watching them grow every week until they grew by two cups is definitely satisfying, I went with what I commented about and after the first 20 days or so I went up by one cup! I simply go'ogled the latest by Mika Klopsworth and now they’re fuller and firmer than I expected!
Кто такой Райан и почему он трахан?

Wow so cool and dramatic 😂
Can anyone name the background music used in the last part of this video?
Wow cool and dramatic!
This is suitable for those people who love to complain & grumble about noises. And it will be very interesting to know how will they fare when they are being confined in such a quietest location like this.
wow cool and dramatic
Absolutely perfect for meditation purpose
Meditation and self-consciousness is the key, i could stay a week in this room with some food and drinks. (And a toilet) I love the utter silence, but indeed.. silence can be loud.  Too bad i can't get there... else i would and destroy any world record.  Cheers.
Heh
It should feel like death in a coffin, probably
Quietest places I've been is outside on a cold snow covered night with no cars and nobody outside. The other place was in Utah I'm not sure where I was it was a lookout point off the main highway I could see for miles but I heard nothing.
test
i'd start singing to myself
So, why does it have to be dark?  Couldn't you have kept the lights on, danced around, sang, etc LOL  Obviously sitting in a quiet, pitch black room is gonna mess with someone.  I'd have a panic attack in a pitch black dark silent room.
An hour of total silence? Sign me up!!!!
I would love to meditate in a room like that.
Wow................
1:01 you sound exactly like michael jackson
u are human garbage if you are watching this 🙂
As hard of hearing I can stay 3 days in this room :D
wow cool and dramtic
Anyone else noticed the pork chop is a chicken breast
If i stay 41 min in there when i come out i would be on 4th floor in hospital psycho room....Yepp
I would love to be in this room as i love to meditate for looong periods  of time.
Meanwhile introverts: 😉
So cool and dramatic
So cool and dramatic

WOOW !!! THE BEST VOICE-OVER ROOM IN THE WORLD !! drive me insane?! are you kidding me !!! give me a Mic and I will be there for a week ...
Is there money involved? I’ll do this
I'd love to go to this room.  Take a pillow and a blanket.  Just to see what it was like.
so this is a dare devil class room????
How much it costs to make such a room for me? I want it.
I didn't get why he needs to stay in fully darkness to test it?🤔
Wow dramatic and cool
I think anyone who meditates regularly could last greater than 41 minutes
The more intelligent a person is, the longer a person can last. For a lot of people, if they don't experience a constant sense of stimulus, they begin to exhibit various psychological disorders.
he is weak is a millenium kid, for 20 years i was 18 and in a quite room, it was so nice and sweet and comfortable that i fell asleep. After 3 hours i woke up annd go to the Toilette, because w alle must. that's biologie and i could even live in so quite room. That the problem of most people in the world is, they are weak and the minds not strong, because the don'T believe on Jahwe.
Helen Keller: I have been doing this for 86 years.
I'd need a light and a book or sth otherwise I'd die of boredom
Oh I would own that record.

Hey man don’t forget to pray and remember jesus loves you he died on the cross for you repent  if you don’t know how to search it up like this how can I repent how can I be save by God. Make sure to have faith in him and trust him and have a relationship with him<:)))
I want to go there too 😢😢
... Ok cool

As someone who wants to scream out loud rlly loud and sing to my heart's content without being a nuisance... THIS. IS. HEAVEN. (Provided the lights are on :) )   I wld rlly stay here and shout/sing till I completely lose my voice 🤧🙃
Imagine studying here

"Steve" Me:HARRINGTON!?
wow cool AND dramatic!!
My big ego thinking I can do it so much longer
The quietest room I've ever been to is examination hall 🤣
The guy just would not stop talking, so the experiment is flawed...
Okay but like the introvert inside me is dying to have a room like this where I can just relax and not feel panicked all the time. My main trigger of anxiety is loud noises (especially loud music or such) and being in a big crowd.
lemme try it, that room looks interesting
That is cool and dramatic
u passed Doctor Phil….
i can do 1 day
lol ez with quiet kid
World's quietest room but still he had to close his ears. For what?

When renovating my house, my storage room had boxes stacked high to the ceiling. It gave this effect. I would go in there and be in my happy place away from my family's noises. It was bliss. I wanted to make that my room!

Wow COOL and dramatic!

Matthew 13:19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.
41 min is too easy 🗿
Whenever I have to wait in a place for a long period of time(from 30 min to 2 hours)I start to repeat an episode of"Kimba"and/or"The Lion King"by heart in my head. I wonder if this would work in this room to make time pass more fast and to not go crazy.🤪I'd like to try.
This Room Is So Good For Meditation.
WOW SO COOL ☺
Wow cool and dramatic.
It could be heaven for depressed overthinking individual

I would stay there for an hour with no effort. No kidding. If you check your phone every minute then you wont have an easy time inside.
I want to sleep in there. 8 hours at least, a normal healthy sleep
Loving place for meditators
bro you should spend a day in my inbox , i bet you would love it
Imagine falling asleep in there
Wait what? I can survive sleeping a year there
that is really the dream place to be in
5:16 goes hard for my tho 😶😶😶

Kinda looks like my dream place, to relax myself with peace.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Wow cool and dramatic
If the rules are to just not to sleep and sit in the room with no lights, then I have a feeling that I could survive this room. That's my type of room that I always wanted.
I’ll love to brain stop in this room. Can I sleep tho?😂
I can survive at least 1 day..........
Anazing

I don't know what's so tough to live in here. Give me appropriate cash prize and I am ready to spend even a week in there with ease.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
i love silence 🤫
I would love this room because I love being lonely and I love when it’s quite also I would probably be doing some kind of physics equation in my head also I hate the light and love the dark
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Woow, cool AND dramatic :D
The only reason I would not survive more than 41 minutes if I'm not sleeping is that I would get bored out of my mind... Probably would start to get sleepy and sleep in too soon XD Also, this is not a challange because you don't hear anything... It is because you don't hear or see anything. With lights on it wouldn't be half as bad.
I could survive about 11 hours in there... Taking a good ol' nap XD
7 vs wild Musik in the background 😂
7:50  Just waiting for ThatVeganTeacher to make a video about all of the things you did wrong here.

If a person is use to be with someone or a group of persons, entering to that room and breaking the record, he starting to feel uncomfortable in just few minutes. But a loner like me, I will start of feel uneasy maybe in the 38th minute.

Cool video, cool rooms, but I think talking even once or walking around to distract yourself once the process starts probably defeats the purpose and takes you out of the experience. Not that I am an expert on it.

Do the autism trick, make humming sounds and thus stimulate yourself. Pun intended. Joking aside, it’s a way to calm your brain. Might work in this room on ”normal” people.

"Because there is nothing around me to experience, I have the perspective that I am the experience"   This is probably the best part for me… If you go down finding the deep practices of Buddhism, there is a similar concept that explains about understanding yourself through undivided attention..
Henry inside
It gets  so quiet you will be able to hear colors

Do it with headphones.
Is it weird that i hear buzzes and stuff even when there is other noise

I know some guy in England lasted over an hour in a similar room. I’m wondering if this one is quieter, because that guy did it three years ago. Maybe technology has progressed.
Claim no negative energy Amen
This is the first ever video I watched from Ryan. 0v0
Not cool because callux beat the 67 minute world record with a time of 1 hour 30 minutes around 3 years ago soo your completely wrong here.
Callux did 1 hour 30 minutes 3 years ago and broke the 67 minute record  so you are incorrect
Great audio in this video lol

ryan you are my fav youtuber i have watched all of your vids
“I have the perspective that I am the experience” man this is a very incredible statement after only a small amount of time without external stimuli.   It often takes lots of meditation to realize the only thing we have is conscious experience. The “you” separate from your conscious experience does not exist.
wow cool AND dramatic
Ryan: "the world record is 41 minutes"  Deaf people "you ask me how I'm feeling, and I have to say that I'm fine but I'm not really fine"

I think i can break this record, by meditating in that room for 1 hr.
That's cool AND dramatic!!!!
Wow cool AND dramatic
I have tinnitus (ringing ears) so my brain would probably implode in that room.
I would easily spend a day in this room if I just had my phone, some food and water. All I need is YouTube installed on the one phone only-
Trahan
That is what teachers expect but it dose not happen the teachers should go there
Wow so amazing and epic like you said
So... Did Dr. Phil every adopt him as his grandson?

Wow that was cool and dramatic
Wow cool and dramatic
Well you have more subscribers than Dr. Phil…..
Wow so cool and dramatic
How did you feel afterwards?
this was cool and dramatic
I always suspected that wouldn't be that hard lol. . . .Aaaaaannnnnnd literally as I type this I hear the ending about how the record is a myth lol.  I guess Steve probably just lets it ride and charges people to chill there.  Respect, Steve.  Haha.

wow cool AND dramatic!!
I was going to say an hour for that room seems very small. I'd be able to do a day easily. I'd be willing to set the actual world record if it's possible to get me in there.
YOU DID IT ALL FOR A PORKCHOP!?!?!?!?!?
🤯🤯🤯🙊👂💔👂
I just need a high speed wifi and my laptop , with these I can litterely spend infinite days
That was cool and dramatic
What has the dark got to do with it...sight is a completely different sense than auditory. Just turn the lights on and stay in the room for an hour.
BRO THAT WAS SO COOL AND DRAMATIC
Thats crazy! The enhanced senses,i was dead for almost 30 minutes and when i came too i could hear see n smell perfect,any other time i cant smell almost anything at any time
Perfect room to record music in
A lot of times I think too much. When I think it's been 10 minutes, it's been 50 minutes 😭 I'm scared.
You didn’t do the challenge because you were talking and popping your knuckles the whole time, but I would be traumatized by hearing my own joints and body noises so good for you for trying!
Omg this is so cool and dramatic!
That was cool and dramatic :)

I was very sceptical from the beginning, but the ending actually made the whole thing interesting.   Sensory deprivation has always been an intriguing topic for me, and this gave me an idea of how to simulate a partial one at home. Thanks

I could live there for a week! It's like a caveman. 😂🤷🏻‍♂️
Would like to stay in that room for an hour, everyday.  Silence helps to improve sense and brings calm in us, which helps in improving focus.
I can stay in there for 5 hours. Send me an invite now and watch me break and make a new record with no side effects.
I have a kid that loves to always make noise. I feel like I could do pretty well in there.
Wow this is cool AND dramatic!

Wait you just broke the world record???????????
in would’ve just took a nap 😴
Can you hear your heartbeat?
I once went to a cave with my school. We were guided up to a certain point that they called "the heart of the cave" or something of the sort, because it was supposedly very deep, and it was a big spatious hall. Then they had us all sit down wherever we wanted, turn of all lights, notifications and such, and be quiet and close our eyes for two minutes. It's been three or four years and I have never felt anything like it to this day: complete silence, complete darkness, even though you know there are several people in this place with you, it still feels like it's just you, alone, with your heartbeat and your bloodflow.  At some point I held halds with my friend (who I had a bit of a crush for) and I could also feel her warmth and her vibrations. That is a moment I will always cherish.
THIS IS COOL AND DRAMATIC
I can spend a day in this room by calling the name OF ALLAH😌💘
sooooo..... is Dr. Phil his grandpa now?

Why does the quietest room have to be dark? That's another stimulus deprived. So ... it's not just the silence.  Setting-up An Experiment 101.

I acctually felt what ryan felt,so i was in this drum studio,it has like those sound deny thing,and i was sitting in the drum chair and then it just started to like make those high pitched loud sound,like damn man,i started hitting those drums but still after hitting them crashes snare and toms it just still,after playing drums it just still make those high pitched loud sound in your ear,and the drum studio that i was playing drum on was using a normal sound deny wall,and my ear could go crazy like ABSOLUTE CRAZY,even when i make sounds like speaking,it still makes that sound,i have tried walking hit the drums playing music standing up it just, CRAZY
So did you get adopted? You passed him didn’t you?
Ryan: stays in room for 1 hour with almost no sound accept his body  The deaf: My life is S I L E C N C E
He is basically wearing air pods with sound cancellation on
wow so cool and epic
Wow cool and dramatic
Wow and impressive
wow cooll and dramatic
When there is nothing to hear I just sing I have no idea why don't ask me I just do
I get sensory overloaded by sound often, and struggle to meditate if there's even the slightest noise. This room sounds like a dream!
so epic and cool
"41 mins in the world's quietest room" The vid lasted 8 mins  My frens telling me i am wasting my net🤣🤣

Steve Harrington from Stranger Things is my fav character :) he’s so cool ✨
Hi
i Honestly could spend 9 hours in this room, cause I would just fall asleep
I an introvert, would even break the limits of the world record.
Let us repent from our sins and accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior one day we will face him and those who doesn't repent from there sins and didn't accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior would be sent to hell for he didn't want God so he will go to place where God is nowhere to be found but the good news is this Jesus has already died for you so you don't have to suffer hell  all you need to do is accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior and repent from your sins you will be saved that Is the good news my friends that salvation is free thats all ask me if your confused at something God bless you.
wow cool AND dramatic!!

wow Cool and Dramatic
I live like 20 mins away from this place. Too bad they charge $600 per hour (not joking, it actually says that on their website) so it looks like I’ll never be going there. $600 for one fucking hour of sitting in a blank room doing nothing? That’s the most insane thing I’ve ever heard of, this guy must be spending too much time in that room
Hey, I live near here! Well, maybe 3 hours away
I'd just...take a nap
Wow cool AND Germanic
Worlds loudest room: You can’t defeat me Humans: I know, but he can *People with tinnitus*
Ryan: I DID IT!  Callux:..
The way his pupils move in night vision...scary
I wanna do this on mushrooms lol
this is dumb af lol, just show up tired and take a nap or sit there and think/meditate or do some yoga or something. I would love to be put up to this "challenge". You don't have to be a baby about it and let 45 minutes of silence drive you insane. its really not that big of a deal... haha
2:16 wow cool AND dramatic!!
A quiet room ? It's paradise !
Wow and that’s cool

Oh yes, I live this dream every night with my ear plugs, love it! =]
That is room I need in my life
You should have kept speaking on any topic you like for the whole time
Where's Steve hiding the demogurgens
U did a bad job in giving info in your description
i struggle to meditate in my house id love to go there and get some peace
Your past doctor Phil know
When silence bothers you this means you need help. I speek by experience. There is no task more dificult than to listen to your inner voice.
I Spent 5 Hours In A Super Quietes Room. When Im Sleeping
U look like Tom Holland lmao
Thuis was cool and epic
Can't you just go in the room and fall asleep? 🤔
I can break the record my just sleeping 😅
Not so hard acctually, i like to meditate so as long as i am comfortable it would be kinda easy
I hope you get your Grandpa soon
RYAN U PASSED DR PHIL!

RHYAN IN 2039: I ACENDED TO HUMANITY HIGHEST LEVEL

WOW Ryan! This is so cool AND dramatic 😱😱😱
Wow cool and dramatic
Is Dr. Phil your grandpa now?
Sorry man it was not
Deaf people: what's wrong about this room
I would like to have the same experience
Wow so sad and funny
Che ca,zata
You overtook Dr Phil 😂😂😂
I'd do this in a heartbeat! Pure silence and darkness is key for me.
I would sleep and stay for hours 😂
This is CooL AND DraMATiC
I would take a nice nap 💤
Wow cool and dramatic
Me põe nesse quarto que eu posso bater o recorde mundial.
I could probably do 8 hours easy.
I would try to imagine someone that I like talking
oh my god i couldnt look away!!
Wow cool and dramatic even after 5 months
you can tell this man just made this room to get away from everyone crap
"Wow cool and dramatic" :(
why wasn't he blinded by the bright light at the end of 1 hour?
Bro I would love to sleep in this room
This is what teachers expect the cafeteria to be like in our school.
Extroverts: that's insane! I couldn't do that!   Introverts: peace is always a choice. That room would be a heaven for us.
Ryan: I beat a 1 hour record inside the world's quietest room  Deaf people: i'm about to end this man's whole career
I appreciate his ability to make a video about a quiet room entertaining
Man I need this room on my daily life....
Wow awesome and dramatic shots dude
Put me there. After 15 mins i'll be asleep
If I'm in that room. What i do is to sing and sing and sing
This was so cool and dramatic.    Ha. Ha. Ha.
I would love this lol
Result loading....... "99% of military aggression on earth shrinking".
This is the power of deaf.  A deaf power guy can easily hack this.

That was cool and dramatic!
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Put a 70 year old person
Wow cool and dramatic scenes
ear tinnitus joins the chat
cool and dramatic
Being an introvert even half of a days or whole day? i survived hahaha cause that's like heaven 💕
It would be amazing place for me tho, lol. If I had paper and pencil, I would draw some arts. If I had nothing there, I could do some practices like pushup, crunch, anything. Or just singing, screaming out loud because nobody would hear. I need that room lol.
I'd appreciate being alone surrounded by silence and away from drama. That room is just great for me to enjoy reciting Amitabha's name in peace.
Later he became daredevil
Bruh I'll be taking a 2 to 5 hour nap
What if you have tinnitus, that must be frustrating
You have quickly became my favorite creator
Kinda place I wanna set my Xbox up an play Xbox all night 😂 no other sounds to distract me
I think the issue Is not that It Is quite but that It Is so dark.
cool and dramatic
Why they didnt put someone deaf in there
Why do I feel like I’ll be claustrophobic in there
I would literally take a nap there 😴😪
Even quiet is to noisy and that’s why since I was 12 years old I always sleep with the fan on. And do to my habit my poor kids have to sleep with a fan too 😳😳😳😳
cool
just try to sleep ahhahaha
Wow! Cool and dramatic!!
How come he didn't sleep off
That was such a cool vídeo 😉
-9 db?? ok...but not true
Well done man!
Ofc he's gonna last an hour. He can't shut up for 5 seconds. If he does he probably wouldn't last 20 mins.
I bet monks would last longer than the world record in that room.. 🤔
this is cool and dramatic
I can hear church bells when I sit in silence..
just sleep through it?
I would just sleep...
THIS WAS REALLY COOL AND DRAMATIC!!!! OMG!!!
I have tinnitus, this will be a literal torture lol.
Maybe if he wasn't allowed to speak, it would have been more impressive.
Wow cool and dramatic ;(
Wow cool AND dramatic
also people's minds are loud, you can't just cancel sound, cause you will still hear yourself.
I would honestly just fall asleep no lie they said you had to be in there a while never said you couldn't sleep through it
I need this room!
I would love to sleep in that room no interruptions
I could stay there for three hours.
at 1:06 it sounded like Shreck!
I wanna meditate in it
I need this room to splip in😆 love it❤️
AM NO LONGER WAITING FOR THE STIMULUS CHECK BECAUSE I KEEP ON GETTING $9,000 EVERY WEEK FROM A NEW TRADING PLATFORMS IN TOWN.
I mean, if the record is under 40 mins to beat, just take a hr long nap in that room lol
I could do a week in silence (assuming I could be dealt food silently) and of course I need to do human stuff to get rid of said food, which isn't always silent. Oh and a shower, once a day, teeth cleaned, all good for the other 23 hours a day
I would feel paranoid in that room
I love sitting in silence, it really calms me down. It’s hard for me to imagine how people can live without silence, like being constantly surrounded by some kind of noises, but by choice. When I come back home after work silence is like heaven for me.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Why didn't you at least dress proper.. you millennials , man up
just letting you know you lick lick the lock smith from army of the dead if you have not seen it
Send me there and i will spend my whole day there.
I feel like my love for psychological horror films would be my down fall in a room like this. That.. and I listen to too much creepy pasta. I probably wouldn’t last very long mentally but physically want to stay in there just to prove that I could😂
Deaf people watching this video: Pathetic
steve definitely grew up with loud siblings
4:20 *_You got more subscribers than Dr Phil. Did you get in contact with him???_*
i wonder how people on the autism spectrum would have reacted.
This is possibly the one situation where my imagination... Actually on second thought my imagination would still be terrifying and try to eat me alive even though it can't touch me so hmhm, no✨
It's not about the room.. it's about the noise inside your own head.
This is how it would be in outter space?  (Not in a spaceship or rocket or in a space suit.)
Letting out an air biscuit in the quiet room would be silent but violent.
cool and dramatic
I wanna take shrooms in there
Life's short!  Take 4 drags and enjoy the same feeling wherever you are 😬😉
I’ve heard tale of the anachoic chamber
i want to visit here
Ha I'm already insane so this is a easy win
Bro you’ve passed dr Phil number of subscribers. I’m keeping my fingers crossed he’ll adopt you!
Wow vool and dramatic
”Mom, dad….I wanna do this-”
You passed dr phils subscriber number!!!!
don’t understand why he wouldn’t just sleep in there.
i would love this
How cool and dramatic :D
This would honestly be heaven to me peace and quiet
He has surpassed Dr.Phil😂
2:14 plz comment “wow cool AND dramatic!!” :(

As a softwere enjaneer i can confrm thes vedeo is record on 30 fps.
Cool and dramatic.
Why is it dark ?
Really cool and dramatic !!!
For those of you wondering what song is at 7:44, it’s called We Are Here by The White Noises. It took me 6 years to figure out what this song was called.

This would be the perfect place to meditate or sleep 😅
Wow cool and dramatic!
you're the experience, so true.
What's the record being in this room?
Just subscribed and oh my god, you're so funny. I was actually wheezing from laughter when you mentioned the camel's butt in a sandstorm. 😂😂😂
You couldn't have brought like a audiobook on a headset or something? Maybe night vision goggles to read a book? xD
Wow cool and dramatic
You passed Dr Phil in subscribers!!
I wonder how this would go if you went in here and just immediately fell asleep
Have a deaf person do this challenge.
That was cool and dramatic.
I can stay in their for hours, being anti social really  helps for this exercise
Such cool Much dramatic
150db at a concert?  laughs at you, HARD in ManOwaR...
I know why it drives people insane the sheer boredom.
When im quiet, im sleep hahaha
This is where I need to go when I take an exam.
They should make a movie or episode of Balck Mirror called "The Quiet Room" it would be a pretty interesting and intense thriller/horror idea...
Sorry, but you wasted my time.
I hope i can hear my blood and my self talking 🤭
I'll set a new record for them,let me in there for 3hours, that would be peace and quiet from all the craziness in the world and be closer with God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit
It sounds like the perfect place for me, as long as my nose doesn't start whistling, like ffs it's so annoying
SOOOO DRAMATIC
I wanna live there
Holly fucking Christ I wanna sleep inside this room forever.
just take a nap and stop bs :))
Wow cool and dramatic
Perfect place for a good sleep
wow cool AND dramatic!!
it took less then 15 minuts to spiritually enlighten 5:16
This looks like a Batman villain origin story
Imagine you've got tinnitus and get stuck in this room 🥴
I would just do matras and allow my mind to explode...but I would enter only if there is greater couse in doing so...like end all wars or clean environment or end  dark web ...etc.
Back in the late 90's/early2000's I played in a metal band called Confrontation in Somerset, NJ. We practiced at the drummers house in a former chicken shack that was behind the garage. No windows, egg cartons covering the walls. On top of that was carpeting. Man, it was loud as f*ck!!! When you weren't playing, it was like the walls were closing in because virtually no sound escaped. Ear plugs required. Good times.
Speaking your mind out is not a thing here
I want to try
wow cool AND DRAMATIC!!!!!1
Why switching of the lights though. Sitting in pitch dark, it's a no from me
wow cool and dramatic!
If you leave a person struggling with their mental well-being in there, I wonder how it will go🤔
Better than our Pt teacher 😂😂
I wanted to live in this room for at least 1 week
hhhhh \
cool and dramatic
he makes it seems so easy
Wow cool and dramatic
Why they don't just turn on a light? Does dark room make it quiter?
I would just take a nap
Wow cool and dramatic!!!!
Hahaha I watch it on my pc
Why souldnt u just sleep.....that s the best place to sleep
Super Dramatic
I don't understand why the lights had to be turned off?
Im an introvert soo
what if you revise in this room?
Introverts: we need the room!
I will end up sleeping in that room :'v
Really want to meditate in this room, just OM chantings ☮️
I would've went to sleep 😅😂
6:34 i did laugh indeed I don’t even know why🤣
didnt callux do better?
I would love that! No noise, perfect for meditation or prayer 💖
As a solitarian silent person who don't like to talk and just be quiet the whole entire day. This room are made for us:D
The key is the darkness. If it was a bright room u could try sitting for longer
Do they allow you to crank one out
One thing: Is it really necessary to have no lights at all? Like what if i bring a glooming stick that doesn't make the sound of a bulb or a neon light, it would be still true to the experience of no sound right?
30 mins in world's quietest room Parents of small kids: Please give me the whole day.
Me being super-introverted: Are we supposed to be impressed by the record?
I'd say the inability to sit in the quiet for extended periods of time without going stir crazy points to other issues, for lack of a better term.
it so easy. the quietest room is my dream room. i hate noises
I feel like if I was in that room I would just sleep tbh 🤣
I could def meditate here omg 😭😭 45 mins isnt enough 🥴
I would have a lot of fun with my tinnitus in this room.
Omg that is so cool,and sooooo dramatic
Seems like a perfect place for meditation.
Your mind is weak!
Survived?! Please I need this.
I can sit there an hour
Me personally I dont think I can be there 🥺 I dont know it makes me feel like im going crazy and more depressed.
Alexa play panic room
Imagine Deleores in this room ( ꈍᴗꈍ)
Wow cool and dramatic :)
i'd just take a nap
It was cool and dramatic 👍🏽
Jesus can change your life ❤️✝️
Part of it for me personally is the room looks super creepy. It looks so enclosed and completely unwelcoming. I wouldn’t be relaxed the second I walk in because it would be hard to shift ur focus from those weird looking structures in the wall pointing out and staring back at you lol
wow cool AND dramatic!!
That room would be horrible to be lock in for an hour.
We have an interrogation room. 8' x 8'. It's very bright. After an hour in there you will be crazy.
It's a simple sunday afternoon when I am on the couch and I close my eyes.
Honestly I think todays younger generation is lost without stimulation.    Get an older hunter in there.
So, kids today just spend their time watching Dr. Phil and listening to Shrek 2. Explains a lot.
Sheer Epicness and so dramatic. 🔥
How Daredevil was made
wo wsc ol an dramtica!!!
Wow this is so cool and dramatic.
This video is cool and dramatic
Dude I'm an introvert with misophonia. This room sounds like pure ecstasy to me.
Ngl, I kinda want to go there and try this out for myself.
wow cool AND dramatic!’
wow, cool AND dramatic! 🤯🤯
Wow. Cool and dramatic
I would have happily meditated in that place. It is such a rare opportunity to be in that complete stillness. Didn't understand why he didn't attempt to meditate.
Wow cool and dramatic
Wow so cool and dramatic!
he passed dr Phill in subscriber's
veri cul and dramatick
whyd they turn off the light tho the hecc
I would like to try
This was sooooo cool and sooooo dramatic! Yep I'm an as*hole!
Hi. I would love to spend a day in this quietest Room. I love silence enough that I stayed like a hermit for two months in the Himalayas and it was the best experience of my life. I have been a vipasaana practitioner for 7 years.
Look, I’d be fine doing this IF there were lights on… I couldn’t do it in the dark.
Wow so cool and dramatic
sus amongus
Thats the room i should make my bedroom
Cool and dramatic
What the hell is this? 3 seconds of my life is wasted 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
As an introvert my idea of fun is being on my own.
Ilove to sleep in that quiet room..😍
To a introvert the world's quietest room would be a breeze!😎
This is so cool.
Meditation basically
I am thinking about deaf people
A perfect place to do a mukbang 💯 👌
I would love to try this
I can stay even 2-3 hours!
I can just sleep for hours
But why does it have to be dark? Lol
I also want to go there ✨✨✨✨✨
I would just fall asleep
Bingo!!! He has surpassed his future grandpa subscribers number of that time!
It's dreamed place for every introvert.😂
I want to be in this room ..... As an introvert i really want
What about 2 hours⌛?
I guess it is a perfect place for those want to meditate..
"The silence is loud" - Ryan
Most of the introverts like me will surpass 45 mins.
04:19
One can do it. Just try to medidate. Such a room is required to focus on your energies.
This was cool and dramatic lol
I never knew you could be tortured by quietness.  I guess nothing extreme is good.
It would be impossible for someone with bad tinnitus like myself to stay in there for even a minute probably. The quieter the room, especially in a smaller boxed in space, the louder the tinnitus. Night time, especially when trying to go to sleep, is a bitch.
Fun fact, its the combination of soundproof and no direct contact of any light that makes it excruciating.. you cant have one without the other..
I want to try it out :)
im gonna beat you by sleeping in that room
Why is it dark thigh?
Wow cool and dramatic
hahahaha, tell me about it while having tinnitus if we can cope with constant ringing , silence is a bless...
It is said that Indian yogis sit quietly for days on end. I guess this should be easy.
A perfect room for introverted person ❤️
for one sec i would say you are patton oswalt's son
Me just waiting for him to fart
Wish I could go there.
So what are the ground rules for breaking the record? Are you allowed to sleep? Can you bring something to do? Or just sit there?
I would love to be in that room!!
WOW COOL AND DRAMATIC!!!
WOW SO COOL AND DRAMATIC RYAN
2:15 wow cool AND dramatic!!
But could this room silence my tinnitus? 🤔
Joke's on them, I AM already insane
I want to go into that room with a big pillow and blanket and sleep for days.
Breaks record for the most talking in the quiet room
I am the experience
You should be there in your 3rd person suit😂
45 minutes of meditation with no distractions? Sounds great to me!
I survived in the world largest room
I will love to try it out. Is it open to the public
Meditation here would be enlightening and liberating
That’s one weird looking pork chop !
wow cool AND dramatic!!
I’ll beat that
Hahahahahaha Dr phil is Up for a treat
Hey this was really cool and dramatic. Haha
Wow! Cool AND dramatic!
I have tinitis, so the constant ringing would fucking make go insane 10 minutes in.
An isolation tank would be more satisfying imo.😑
When Ryan screamed in the quite room, he sounded like Tom Holland in his American accent
Cool and dramatic
This video would have been much better if the footage was the only clip in this content.
I m not deaf..but still I am 100% sure I can survive this
*goes to quietest room in the world* so dark
Wow cool and dramatic!
Meditation?
The perfect place to sleep
you ARE the ultrasound of somebody's baby... YOUR PARENTS
You can hear your ears ringing
I'm SURE I would be crazy hearing my heartbeat right in the head, the veins PULSING... my labyrinth and my nerves wouldn't stand it.
WHEN JHON WICK ENTERED THE ROOM, THE ROOM STARTED TALKING
💀💀the way my brain would start scaring the shit out of me by staying in dark room by imagining scary shit 💀😭
Last year I suddenly lost my hearing in my right ear.  Now I suffer from a nerve breaking tinnitus 24/7.  Talking about insanity?  Tinnitus is torture and nobody can help me.
Wow! What a man cave!
Canny
I would easily stay there 2 days
Wow cool and dramatic !
can i go there and spend my whole day there?
Is there air conditioning in the room to keep the room stay cool?
Are you allowed to take a nap?
No light because the lamp has noises too?
Introverts : Wow... A Paradise...
"That was some loud silence"                             -Ryan Trahan 2021
youre so funny and remind me of tom holland
Congrats and cool video..hope the dr. Phil stuff was a joke ha...ha... jk I hated that part lol
What if some one sleeps....
Where can I enlist to break the record??
A book lover will love this💒
They have things called isolation tanks which are similar to that room. I would love to have one of those rooms, would be great for meditation.
Ain’t no way this hard.
The poor bugs inside there for 1 minute : “ DIES “
I probably could appreciate this peace...
man that room is heaven for us Yoga practitioners.
Hola solo quería recordarles que Dios los ama mucho y los espera con los brazos abiertos, él busca personas dispuestas no perfectas ❤️
a weird guy kept there for 5 hours
I would definitely go to sleep in this room.
Go to Atacama desert, cycling or walking all day long onto it. You will listening the quiet place on Earth. Absolute nothing! I spent 20 days in there, going back to the road just to take some water bottles with truck drivers.
What’s the big deal? You don’t always need someone to tell you how cool you think you must be. Lay down and have a nap.
I want to try this now if I fly out there will they let me try?
just put a bed make sure its cold and ill beat it by sleeping
Never go too jail
It should be name the Best Place To Sleep on Earth
That room wasn't quiet for more than 30 seconds at any point 😂
I want this as a study room
As a mother of 5 and 2 full time jobs I would have a nap 😴
Wow ..this is perfect for me .. I love complete silence
I'd love to go in that room, but my farts get really Really bad. Lol
I need this room in my house.
Why you don't sleep in this room?
My mind cant be quiet no matter how silent the room is
My tinnitus: HAHAHA
I have hearing loss and I wear hearing aid/CI to hear and this room would still be crazy to be in😂😂😂I would still try it to see if I would go crazy😂
Wow… I want my bedroom to be super silent.. ❤️❤️❤️
Go and get that grandpa boy!
Where is this quiet room??
Sounds like a great place to record an album
YO U CAN BE ADOPTED BY DOCTOR PHIL NOW
so cool
Sounds like a vacation
Shrek 2 has a banger soundtrack, let's be honest
Loud rock concerts are more like 110-120db according to google
I can challenge you….no problem…..I am just thinking why light closed…chill
👏👏
Where can I find instructions to create this room in my house? 🤣
Honestly it would *almost* be like taking the STAAR test when you were one of the first to finish. Except the STAAR test is 4 hours of nothing to do.  Also if this drives you insane, imagine what deaf people think about not hearing anything at all their whole lives.
As a proud wearer of tinnitus, I am immune to silence, even in this kind of room.
less than an hour in the quietest room makes you crazy????  Then, how do deaf people survive a lifetime of quietness?!!!!!!!!!!!
wOw CoOl AnD dRaMaDiC
WOW. VERY COOL AND DRAMATIC
Wow! Cool and dramatic!
Any room can be the quietist room if you shut up enough.
Nu vet vi vart Gordon Dewoon fick denna idé ifrån!!!
So basically when you have adhd.... and get tired.
LOLOLOl BS.  Try 90 days lil kid lololol
So space
the only thing that would stop me from staying in this room is the need to go to the restroom.  I would love the quiet.
This video is hilarious 😂😂😂😂 *pork chop noises* *coffee noises* lol not to mention I literally thought he passed out 😂😂😂
I would love to have a room like that in my house, I love silence.
Lol.. This is the most gen Z/Millenial video I've ever seen...
i would realy weant to try that    i would fall asleep in there   ye yes
Stay in *Audiometry Room* 🙂 What's new !
wow cool AND dramatic!!
I am not really getting it ... There are sooooo many deaf people out there, what about all of them? And they cannot even hear themselves speak.
Did Dr. Phil ever adopt you as his grandson?
Dude!  its so cool and dramatic
Haha don’t bro worry it’s cool and dramatic
Lol nice acting
Jesus 17 million views for this? I’ve been in one of these before as an engineer. This guy didn’t discover Atlantis people?!!
L callux did longer
Could we sleep??
Reported this video
Yeah pretty cool
I made my entire master thesis in an anechoic chamber spending somedays up to 6 hours (ofcourse including in and outs) preparing experiment setups for 2 years. But I am pretty sure I spent more than an hour in most cases. Nothing dramatic about it. Actually, it was very peaceful.
An hour pff I would like to spend my whole life in that room
World’s quietest room = relief!!!
I can't handle ALOT of quiet. I find ALOT of silence very unnerving anyway so i wouldnt be able to do this for that amount of time. I would go nuts. Lol
I would just sleep in that room hahaha
Put me there i will sit for 1 full day if you want but pay me. Lol
Wow so cool and dramatic bro.
Wouldn't it be much better to just sleep there? :D
It looks like one of those overly hyped monster chasing video's.
I get the silents is silent and probably very loud but I believe for most of us would be the dark or a uncomfortable chair…. Now give us a recliner with a book in this room mii oh at us could go longer then 41 mins.  I want to believe that. Then again the experience is probably based on what we are seeing not Etsy we want.
I’d love this It sounds so peaceful
I can only imagine the struggle of deaf people. Really, props to them.
well imagine the infinity of hellfire, with every faculty and sense overwhelmed with torment. Repent and get right with Jesus Christ! Cry out for his Holy Spirit and follow him!  "All wicked men’s pains and contrivance which they use to escape hell, while they continue to reject Christ, and so remain wicked men, do not secure them from hell one moment. Almost every natural man that hears of hell, flatters himself that he shall escape it; he depends upon himself for his own security; he flatters himself in what he has done, in what he is now doing, or what he intends to do. Every one lays out matters in his own mind how he shall avoid damnation, and flatters himself that he contrives well for himself, and that his schemes will not fail. They hear indeed that there are but few saved, and that the greater part of men that have died heretofore are gone to hell; but each one imagines that he lays out matters better for his own escape than others have done. He does not intend to come to that place of torment; he says within himself, that he intends to take effectual care, and to order matters so for himself as not to fail. But the foolish children of men miserably delude themselves in their own schemes, and in confidence in their own strength and wisdom; they trust to nothing but a shadow. The greater part of those who heretofore have lived under the same means of grace, and are now dead, are undoubtedly gone to hell; and it was not because they were not as wise as those who are now alive: it was not because they did not lay out matters as well for themselves to secure their own escape. If we could speak with them, and inquire of them, one by one, whether they expected, when alive, and when they used to hear about hell ever to be the subects of that misery: we doubtless, should hear one and another reply, “No, I never intended to come here: I had laid out matters otherwise in my mind; I thought I should contrive well for myself: I thought my scheme good. I intended to take effectual care; but it came upon me unexpected; I did not look for it at that time, and in that manner; it came as a thief: Death outwitted me: God’s wrath was too quick for me. Oh, my cursed foolishness! I was flattering myself, and pleasing myself with vain dreams of what I would do hereafter; and when I was saying, Peace and safety, then suddenly destruction came upon me." (J.Edwards, Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God)
This place is gonna be the best place to sleep ever 🤣
Bro I thought he actually passed out 😂😭 he scared me for a sec loll
you look like bobby flay  when he quit cooking
He would've have too force me out of that room lol
I could live in that room.
Wow! So cool and epic!
This room wouldn't be very quiet for me, my tinnitus wouldn't allow that.
I live downtown, that place looks like paradise..
People with tinnitus 🥲🥲🥲
I'll fall asleep while sitting on the chair for sure if I'm here 😅
Wow very interesting video and never knew about this. Thanks man.
Introverts: ha! Pathetic!
Super cool & dramatic
This has gotta be the easiest shit ever!
I could sleep in there so peacefully.
me who sometimes get in charged in the house when no one is there: ......... why am i sitting for an hour this is getting creepy
Try being with my kids. You will run to the quiet room.🤣🤣
as a guy with autism I would live in that room forever
I want to sleep in this room
rent this room to an introvert.. 💲💲
learn vipassana, then try again
I went this place, I was there for 5 hours~ almost fucked myself
That depressed sitting position, i recognize it somewhere
I love loud silence. It's so peaceful.
Wow. Cool and dramatic!
Just meditate
I would take the room for a nap
I've never wanted to trip acid somewhere so hard before in my life
Wow cool n dramatic
My apt so quiet unreal gonna die of boredom 🤣🤣🤣 lol
The end is epic 😂 😂
I bet I could spend 24 hours in there, or even fall asleep ...
I’m sure google wont change of the world record
When he said "Because there's nothing around me to experience, I get the perspective that I am the experience" he reminded me of Krishnamurti's words that "The observer is the observed" and Buddhism.
LOL Crazy.
Most people couldn't sit in a silent room with their own thoughts mostly because their thoughts are not rooted in reality or their personal identity, their identity of themselves is based on others perceptions of them. Truth is in Christ
Silence is never alone, it is always full of answers.
The my breath is kickin part made me burst out my tea! 😂
I NEED THIS
“I am the experience.” Wow
Imagine being there with tinitus…
Done tons of shrooms and tripped for 10 hours. I think I can survive 40 min in a quiet room.
Idk what's wrong with a quiet room though. That would fit the anesthetic when I'm reading a book. Obviously I haven't got there yet. I'm just questioning what makes you feel uncomfortable in a quiet room.
Why they have to turn off the light ...like to make it scary ...wtf ...makes no sense but that will make him nuts or insane...I love to stay in quiet place and I can stay I guess...just gv me food n water nothing else.. People who never tried to be in silent room normally can't do... u won't believe...I used to light candle 🕯️ look at it with focus in dark room..and any person who went through insanity n mental breakdown n cured himself from madness without meds...took time..can do anything... He did good like it's a good experience for him...it's makes u feel panicked...and it's good...good experience and wow...I'm happy but I wanted to see the whole video with actual time...not in 8mins so I don't belive the Internet..
Sounds heaven for me
I can be more than this t Room in this but with peace to worship Allah Masha allah..
I would go there and sleep for four hours
I would just take a mattress and sleeping bag and go for a quiet nap there ^^
So he technically broke two records that day for being in the most quiet and darkest room for more than 40min
Did Dr Phil adopt u??
I still don’t really understand how being in a quiet room is hard, or how silence is loud
Just take a nap
I have tinnitus, I would go crazy in there
I must be the only person thst doesnt understand the issue with this. Sitting in silence? Where is the problem? Genuinely bemused!
kool🔇
Wow cool and dramatic
Lol silence is my talent I'd actually make history in there!
no
Could I please sleep in that room? 😍
wooooow!! so cool and dramatic😆
I'd do anything just to be able to brake this world record once a day,for the rest if my life.
He's funny and everything, but being locked in any room would make you crazy if you are meant to be there without literally anything to entertain yourself. In prison for example at least they have tv and can bring newspapers or books to read. So in my opinion of course it is about the silence, but just to some extents.
Me firing a 357 Magnum handgun 165db 😂
gordon ramsey off wish
He who fails to sit alone in silence is not at peace.
wow soooo cool and dramatic
wow cool and dramatic
wow its cool and dramatic
I would simply take a nap and break the record lmao
I have tinnitus, so there's no quiet place in the world for me.
I'm deaf, everything is quietest room.
This is the room ASMR artists want
wow cool and dramatic
Id love to try this im quiet confident i could best the record i am curious do you have to sit still or can you move around
The loneliness is my speciality give me some snack and water and I can live in that room for a days lmao
“Wow cool and dramatic” :(
lmao
Wow so cool and dramatic
The silence is loud
Cool AND dramatic video!
I was once stuck in headphones mode for a long time (Prob about 2years???) on IPhone when I was a child a few years ago and also on my PC when my speaker stopped working way back when I was around 6-7+ years old I never told my parents that bc I didn’t mind that much about it and it feels so werid to play some games with sound when I grew up never listening to background sounds in the games (Now I’m curious how I even manage to go through with this back then)
How much money will i win if i survive that quiet room ? I would even stay the double the time required!
finally a place where I can sleep
As an introvert ....I'll love to be there!! 😍😂
Well since I suffer from tinnitus it wouldn’t be silent at all 😂
wow cool and DRAMATIC
wow -_- aplause
I could easily do this
7:22 what is the background music around this time??? It's driving me crazy bc i KNOW i know it but i cant find it
5:14 he unironically glimpsed enlightenment
I think it's more about the lamb chops more than the room itself.
The "maddening" part of it is purely exterior to itself (it's just the purely formal awareness that "this is the quietest room there is"). Nothing else.
If anyones got tinnitus then that room would be like torture
U know who can defeat quite room? Parents with noisy kids
Do meditation brother then it will be easy
heaven
Def people feel same?
finally a room where I can sleep in peace.
You've already passed Dr. Phill on youtube, were you able to contact him?
I'd do that for more than an hr, Id get a bloody good sleep
I love when is silence, quiet and dark.  Love it
What if you just went to sleep lol could have broke the record for 6 hours haha
Um treino de atenção plena, basicamente
Cool and dramatic
outlast
sei un figo! questo video è la primissima volta che lo vedo in Sardegna, chiaramente un video tutto casereccio.
I would sleep 10hrs there.
wow!This wideo is so cool and dramatic!
Imagine what would happen when u r hurried
I want to know. Was he at regular intervals informed of how many minutes he was in when inside that room?
wow Cool and dramatic
Ngl, I'd live in that room and it would be a blessing.
Who else wanted to pop their knuckles when he popped his?
my tinitus would keep me company
Dude, I'd have that world record easy. I could live in there.
wow cool and dramatic :)
wow cool and drammatic
wow cool AND dramatic!!!
Iam ready to break the record, there should not be any counselling or wordings with me before i enter that event or after and before entering...
I CAN SIT THERE FOR MORE THAN A HOUR AND THAT TOO EASILY 😀  ITS VERY SIMPLE I HAVE A SPECIAL MANTRA FOR IT 👌
Seemed like a very nice room to meditate in..
"Nature abhors a vacuum." - Aristotle

Deaf people leave the chat
You have not meeet aghoris🚩 or Yogis.. who do Yoga..!! They will beat this record easily 🇮🇳 Who pray silently in Himalayas!!  They can beat you!

Hey, you beat Dr Phil.
World record there: 45 minutes Me, who'd love to just pray there: amateurs
I have terrible tinnitus so I quess I wouldn't survive
Can we sit with eyes closed or can we meditate there ???
WOW SO COOL AND DRAMATIC!!
I'm living in such a world for last two years!
Wow! Cool and dramatic!
Ridiculous. I used to meditate in those rooms for days. It won’t do anything to you. It’s all boredom that some people can’t handle.
Great Video
Uh how bout deaf people? Are they insane?
Buddhist monk will gladly enter that room amd meditate
i spent 3 days in a prison isolation cel.. does that also count?
id love to sleep in that room lol
Introverts: are you challenging me?
This world record can never be achieved by any woman because, they can never shut up🤣🤣🤣
How to survive Quiet Place (movie) - stay in this room
Wow cool and dramatic
As a voice over artist that room is a dream come true.
I would personally sleep so good there
My first reaction: "well I’m deaf“
Can i meditate in that room?
so you adopted now?
woow this us cOoL aNd draMaTIC
What a fuss. Have you never been awake after midnight in a quiet bedroom, when the cars are gone, there is no wind, no one is talking, and you can hear your ears and your heart? It is no big deal.
wow!!! cool AND dramatic!!!
That LOOK on his face when the other bloke opened the door :D
i think my tinnitus would be magnified 100x.
Wow...cool AND dramatic!!!
World's Quietest Room:   My Tinnitis: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I would sleep.
With how much I talk I would have a conversation with my self dude
WAIT?! The record is a myth?!?!? they spreading that around just to get people to try it?!?!?!?!
need this room for my studio
White people just can’t meditate ig
of course he put you in the world's loudest room first. so then you know what absolute silence is. do this without seeing the world's loudest room first.
as a paruresis sufferer, a absolutely quiet restroom where you cant hear anyone is a godsend
wow cool AND dramatic😝😝😝
You passed him on YouTube subscribers
I would be up for trying it
Isn’t that the experience of meditation 🤗
It must be the hardest for those who are accustomed to talking all the time.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
My tinnitus would drive me insane in that room.  In a very quiet room it is slightly noticeable.  In that room it would be deafening.
This is very easy we r meditation people ......so many cave inside do ...we do hours
Wow. So cool and dramatic 🤩
I would have so fallen asleep in such a quiet place.
God bless...
I dont wanna spoil the ending but that was kinda sad about the time record hahahahahs
I'd LOVE to get in that room. Best sleep ever. Lol. I have hypersensitivity.
Can some tell me the soundtrack at the end? 07:43
can u survive the worldest quietest  ass whooping??
This is what ı want from my neighbors.
i would take a very nice nap in that room
"I survived the world's quietest room" *continues to talk and make noises every 30 seconds*
is Dr. Phil your grandpa now?
wow cool AND dramatic!!!
Didn’t Veritasium survive in this room for an hour and had no issues.
cool and dramatic
O can beat this so easily
so cool and dramatic
How about white room challenge?
I wanna sleep there
Why don’t I just fall asleep
wow cool and dramatic!!!!!
Wow! Cool and dramatic shots dude... nice
I want to break that record.
I try my best to achieve this every night. As someone who has experienced addiction I see this as an easy experience. Some people can't STOP the noise. This would be heaven.
I’d take a long ass nap! My neighborhood is so loud!
Deaf people do too
My tinitus would kill me in this room
Imagine how loud a fart can get in that room if you release it after 30mins.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
As a person with severe hearing loss who does not hear anything without it - yes it is scary. You need time to adjust, worst is during the night when You are not using hearing aids as You have no longer -range sensory input which can cause stres. Of course You are getting used to it more and more but it will never be as normal.
cool & dramatic
WOWW cool and dramatic
I would be dragged out of the room because I'll never want to leave
41 minutes record? Ask any deaf people lol.
Oh this is the new part of Paranormal Activity
Only subscribed to help you with your quest
This was a time to close to God. So quiet but to talk to him or yourself 😀
Meditation wins at this,
This is on my Bucket List!
Wow cool AND dramatic!!
Wow this was really cool and dramatic!
Id just sleep
WoW cOol and drAmaTic
wow cool and dramatic
I can beat your record time. I have Cerebral Palsy and movement is something I have difficulty with, thus I can put more focus in sitting and keeping myself calm. I would be able to sit in that room for hours,
Introverts : *Pathetic* .
5:20 Did you just right there get insight into the true nature of reality in just 20 minutes of sitting in the quietest room? holy shit
It’s the quitest room why are you blocking your ears with your hands ??
Importance of white noise ⚠️💥
Why does being in the world's quietest room require the light to be off?
Best place for introverts....
wow! that was cool and dramatic
I'm pretty reclusive myself, I reckon I'd smash this record.
For people who has social media and cellphone addiction this is an insane place. But for people who like meditation and self-consciousness this place is perfect 👍🏻
Got your new Granpa already?
wow so cool and dramatic
"survived"
wow, cool and dramatic
Ich muss da rein :D
wow cool AND dramatic
Cool and dramatic
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Silence is so calming.
wow cool and dramatic :O
As a person who is hard of hearing. I’ll say, first time???!!! 😂😂😂
only 41 mins? not really an accomplishment lol... try 24 hours
Cant u sleep in thr
This is cool but if I was there.. I already snore in that chair I guess? Even looking him in this video I feel sleepy
Why the room is dark? Because fear has a major part in every experiment. I just hate the regular human experiment types to exploit our flaws held by fear, but not to develop skills to improve our senses.
Think how space is
I really would like to have one of this rooms in my house. i always try to reach for the total silence in my house in the countryside but Is not possibile of course.
wow that was cool and dramatic
the whooshes is basically your blood flowing
AS of right now you have more subs than Dr.Phil so it has to be asked.. WHENS THE COLLAB WITH GRANDPA?
I feel like I can break this record
1:05 sounds like Link
Finaly, a rooms that's perfect for stacking cards to make a pyramid shape or something..  Tho. The lights must on.. 😗
It's hard to believe that he didn't make new friend inside that room.
He just need a phone with WiFi or eat a sleeping pill before goning there.
wow cool AND dramatic
He is the opposite of Zen  like a adhd kid just sit still and meditate like the guy said .....Lil bich
Hah... the infamous WW2 Gestapo torture chamber... THE QUIET ROOM!!!
that room would be heaven for  me would love to try it
Now you can be Dr.Phill's grandson
I will just sleep there if I was trapped
stupid move of adding background music to this video.
Imagine going in and coming out with superman level hearing.
Couldn't you just get in there and sleep for a few hours?
Just sing for a whole time and you're gonna beat the record. ✌️
Does he have a grandpa yet?
Come to my home u will find whole day
cool
Wow cool and dramatic
I wished the video was 41 minutes long to see if I could survive with him.
Anybody that's been locked up could beat that
I could do That
It was cool and dramatic definitely
I would appreciate that room. Needed that when I was reviewing for the bar exams.
Sign me up for some peace and quiet
Cool and dramatic
Wow cool and dramatic
Why did you censor saying Baloney
I would've probably just went to sleep or did yoga the whole time lol
What bullshit. An expectation is set up, only to reveal at the end that those expectations are untrue and irrelevant by the end. Just say you're in a quiet room and describe what it's like, liar.
The parent with 5 kids is looking for the the sign-ups.
Bro, deaf people got this challenge no problem
Great experience! I wonder if you notice any improvement of your hearing? Did you hear better than before or did you get more sensitive after this? I’m curious.
wow!
Crlh, o narrador fala mt rápido, gastei todos os meus anos de listening pra entender
Sorry, but the quietest room is located in Finland.
Wow that was cool and dramatic
wow how dramatic :oooo
wow, cool and dramatic
wow col a nd dramatic
Tripping Acid in the world's quietest room seems like a bad time lol
I live not far from where this room is located but have never tried to go in it.  I can hardly stand the sounds in my ears in just a normal quiet room.
Both rooms look terrifying tbh….
Fun fact:  sustained total silence could damage your ears, the mechanism could seize up.
you gave me a good reason to subscribe actually
I swear watching this video is painful.😭
I'd rather be in a place that is very quiet than a very noisy place and very loud people. Very annoying.
That shit threw me off at the end 😂
This is BS. 🙄 41 MINUTES as record? 😂 I will just take nap. There is no rule, You NEED to be loud there. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Ridiculous.🤨
God I love silence. I wait for that time of the night when the kids are asleep, everyone in my neighborhood is quiet af and I just lay in bed and let me thoughts just come in waves and then subside until I fall asleep. God I could last 1+ hr easy in that room
I watched this on mute because I'm at work, it was the worlds quietest video.
this is really cool and dramatic ryan!
U dont know a quiet room and being brought to the point of insanity,  until  the guards slam that door on you.  All you have is your thoughts , no people,  no family,  no sound, and you will find yourself in a sea of  emotion bit know 1 is around to here the screams because there inside your head driving to the point . So dont tell me about the world's quietest room baby boy . You tell wes Watson is shit see where that gets you
I could do this easy
I already have mild tinnitus, my ears also get blocked easily. I'm used to ringing and rushing sounds. I could do an hour. Boredom would be the hardest part.
I would try to sleep tho and i would crush that record. Just kidding i would feel sad all alone
I have acuphene, these room doesn't exist for me
i am the experience
I have a strange feeling that I would be kicked out of this room for being in it too long.. the world is so loud and never shuts up..
Don’t know how i ended up here but I’m not upset.
That is one of the biggest load of BS I have seen on YouTube.
Can remain for 2 hours.... Contact me
Wow, cool and dramatic!
If i have to do nothing i can't be in any room quieter or not doesn't matter....so bullshit
Gimme something more comfortable to sit on In there first shit
Big deal
wow ! so cool and dramatic !
This video is so full of crap
Can you go to sleep?
It was cool and dramatic.
Wow, cool and dramatic
Well, people like me with tinnitus won't have any problems, though.😂😂
30 mins is a exaggeration most likely it needs to take months for you to go insane in that room
too cool and dramatic
can i go there? i think i will take a nap in there! i am willing to spend 48 hours in there and smash all records! the thing is i love the sound of silents! i love it so much i would prefer to be deaf!
mosquitoes will make this worse
This is every introvert or mother's paradise
He could have meditated
I want to try it
In WWii my gpa was in secret service. Taught me the strongest of character is ppl who can be in total silence with no issues. Also strong will power. Which many drug addicts could avoid rehabs by knowing they do have the power to stop. Believing is everything!
I want you Grandpa Dr Phil too!
I’ve been thinking a lot about hearing health these last couple of weeks and I came to the conclusion that everything we do and have around us is LOUD. You know what I mean when electric power is down and everything becomes so quiet it’s weird.
why lights off in quite room?
They should design play rooms for kids like this.
cute version of HELL
Moleza, quero ver tu ficar ali tendo zumbido no ouvido... eu ja quase cometo suicídio todo santo dia por causa dessa merda UHEueheueheuhu
I am light sleeper. Very responsive to sound . Seems a place i  can sleep well here and being an introvert i can do my work.
wow! this was cool and dramatic.
Wow cool and dramatic😶
You found an alien among us! Another great discovery
Wow thats cool and dramatic
Would the outer space be as quite as this?
Meditation is key
The pork chop looked overdone
I'd go to sleep, sing as loud as I want, and maybe dance idk
Inkem pankedentra niku
that pork chop looks a hell of a lot like a chicken breast Ryan!

WoW Cool And Dramatic!!!!!!
wow cool and dramatic :D
i think that would be the best room to take uninterrupted naps.
So did his eyes have to be open? Couldn't he sleep ?
wow, that was so cool and dramatic

I can survive this more than an hour if I just sleep there. That's the best sleep I will ever have.

THE RECORD IS A MYTH? OMG, I hear people talking about this Fnkg room all the time... good to know, thanks!

Mannnnn

“Have you met Dolores?
Those shots were cool and dramatic 👍
Imagine being in that room when suffering from Tinnitus
Is no one going to talk about how this exact video was made by Callux 2years ago?
I’m only NOT subscribing because u need a better grandpa than Dr Phil who is quite obviously a loser. Great video tho 👍🤣
100% of every single viewer thinks they can beat the world record  And im one of them 😤
easy, bye
Nice.
yeah i can already hear the bones in my neck grind against each other with out that room along with ringing in my ear sometimes tho id still would love to be in there id fall asleep lol
Am I able to rent this room out for a couple nights to finally get some decent sleep??
Has Dr.Phil adopted you yet ?
u past dr phil :o
This room is like Nirvana/Moksha/Satori etc. to any budhist monk/guru/yoga master lol. If you can sit absolutely still and get your breath and heartrate super low it must be pure bliss to experience yourself like that. To have your mind just start flowing along to the sound of your blood flowing and your heart beating and lungs breathing and everthing. *Turn off your mind, relax, and flow downstream.*
WOW, cool and dramatic! ;)
Do you ever stare at something for like 45 minutes straight and the whole world looks like one of those neural network visualizations? Like just don't blink and stare at the same light in the dark for like 30 minutes. It's a weird feeling, just existing.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
WoW So COol aND DRyaDic!  🥴
How can it be -9db?? Shouldn't it be 0db??
I could do it for an hour +😐
You want that doctor to be your gramphater😂
WOW
Two of my friends and me all guys in our high school days tried a version of this in my basement. We closed all the curtains, turned off the lights and played a game of tag or tackle in the darkness. You learned very quickly that sound was the enemy. You removed any jewelry, watches, and belts. Then you removed sneakers that could squeak on the tile floor. You could hear your ears, then your breathing, then your heartbeat. All knowing that you could be tackled or tackle at any time. It was like psychological torture. I called for an end and we turned on the lights. We NEVER played that game again.
I wish I'm not the only Introvert that planning own this kind of room. My brain start pricing. Lmao
Should have been most boring room
why the most quite room has to be dark too? I thought it's only to test the deafness of the room, not the darkest thing too
you are the drama
I would enjoy that place
I subscribed so this guy gets adopted as his grandson. Who's with me!
Not impressed at all !!!
I'm bettor I  spent 24h in the worlds QIETES ROOM <3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Easy challenge
I tough It was Kleatus Cassidy in the thumbnail lol
Perfect for recording... Music
These soundproof rooms are like deafeningly quite. I’ve been in these rooms during my hearing aid tests /audiogram tests not sure about the name lol. It’s hard to stay in this room for those saying it’s a zen place to relax lol! I’m even partially deaf but I can’t stand the quietness!
Guarantee I can break the world record. I’ll fuckin stay days in there bruh
Try living in third world countries in Asia let's see if you survive
Good Place to HIBERNATE for FEW YEARS from all the $hhhit going in todays world..

is there anything that prevents you from falling asleep?  cause quiet and dark translates into nap time for me.
…because there nothing around me to experience, I have the experience, that I am the experience… Ryan Trahan 2021

"I survived the world quietest room". Sooo... I don't see the problem there. There is no sound? Ok, good. Lucky you. I lived for years with a Tinnitus in my ears, I literally don't know anymore what is "quiet" and "silence". Try that, then we will see if you are not going crazy.

Actually I am able to hear the flow of blood to brain, when I'm awake over 3 am.

When I was a student at Uni, we built a room similar to this one. Of course it wasn’t as professional as the one in the video but it was still super cool.  We also started a challenge of who could last the longest. Most of us made it to 60 minutes, I only stayed in there for half an hour because the sound of my own blood rushing was just crazy. Well, but there was this one dude, who went in there and instantly fell asleep, he fucking spent 5 hours in there and said, I quote, „Best damn nap I ever had!“
Wow this is cool AND dramatic
Dude ,next time bring weed .
Wow! Cool AND dramatic!!!!

Deaf people…
2:15 was so cool AND dramatic :O
I would love to go in there especially suspended in water pool  - I would so fall to sleep in there as I do in saunas for hours because I wear data center earplugs and  I do when I go to sleep every night. You can hear you hear beat through the blood rushing around your ears. I love quiet and really hate noisy places and probably the only one that wears in-ear ear phone in a Cinema just to block out the loud noises - DC ear plugs block out too much noise.  I also wear noise cancelling headphones just to ignore the hum in my office from all the computers.  I want an office like this man has created.  Thank you for making this video it was fun, total darkness and quiet, bouncy noisy room no so.
I can handle it
Why did my ears suddenly hurt while watching this? 😂
wow cool AND dramatic

If you want to read the Gospel then I will put something like that in my replies but if you read that then you should still read the complete Gospel. If you read it then like the comment so that more people can see it and more people have at least one opportunity because accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior is the most important decision that you will ever make
I am so stupid, for some reason, I thought the photoshop bar scene was made by steven orfield at first.

It’s compulsive meditation. Nothing more to make it do special.
If I don’t hear ANYTHING MUCH AT ALL.- I hear.. whispering or random stuff-. Idk why-
I seem to remember that Yamaha has an anechoic chamber (that’s the technological name for these rooms) in Japan whose audio muting effect is so strong that two people standing back-to-back, eight feet apart, cannot hear each other… even the floor is done. Now since directionally decreases with pitch, the only thing that one might hear, is the very low frequencies that resonate out of the back of skull, and absorbed through the back of the other’s head. 😳 I would love to try it. 😀
ASAP science broke the record 🙃

wow cool AND DRAMATIC:)
Him: plz just tell me this is cool and dramatic  Me: Woah 🤯 that is so cool and very dramatic
Woow cool and dramatic
So cool so dramatic
I would sleep I can be in there for 3 Days easy  The reason people can’t stand being there is because your ear drums & brain are used to sound around us & Rf waves etc etc you have to focus on past life experiences whisper thoughts whisper songs & your Good Your perception of reality is enhanced because all subliminal hearing &  visual distortion presence ceases to exist you create full focus within your own organism
did you hear your heartbeat?
What's the record for surviving the loudest room? (although that's probably a rocket testing facility and quite deadly)
It would be worse if there was a random jump scare.
Tell me more about these 150 dB rock concerts. I think that would be the last concert I ever heard! I'd probably feel like I'd been in a mosh pit just from being too near the speakers.
Could you read or do sth? The quest was all about doing nothing?
05:20 whoaaaa 😂👍🏼👍🏼
wow cool AND dramatic!!
How can we participate in this challenge to break the record?
What about the deaf people, living their whole life in quiet.
Wow, cool AND dramatic

If is a quite room why you not shut up?
Umm…. No one’s gonna talk about the fact that his eyes are glowing white from the flash. If you didn’t know it means he has an eye disease,yeah you might wanna go to the doctor!!!!
Why aren't u blinking i think that why ur eyes getting hurt.
is this how a blind person adapts?
that was a chicken breast.
wow! so cool and dramatic :)

Vegan: The animals are raised in cages in excrement, and urine, and you put them in your mouth?
I would sleep there to make a new record
MONKS can spend hours in that room, deeply meditating. It's not that difficult for some people.
🤔 I have to dispute the 150dB claim of “front row” of a rock concert. Being in the music world for a while now I’d surmise that 150dB is at total peak transient - and that’s a maybe - why? Most active (powered) speakers have a total output handling of 130-137dB (at peak transient) before failure or driver distortion. That being said, most Rock concerts, if EQ’d correctly, achieve 110/115dB RMS with the peak transients around 118/122dB. RMS = Root Mean Squared. In other words, rms is the overall decibel (A-weighted) average throughout the program. 150dB is more like a Glock or a 12-gauge shotgun fired at 1 meter. These readings could be achieved from a high pressure microphone that possesses an unusually stiff capsule - and even then you may damage the mic. If you measure a rock concert, C-weighted or Z-weighted, maybe you’d see some 130dB or 135dB.    I’m not trying to be difficult or a d*ck or a know-it-all, but after a particular level, one can’t hear the music anymore because it overexcites the room modes within the venue and the sound engineer just turns the band back down after a few songs anyway. Sometimes this happens by as much as 12dB.   Most guitar amps won’t produce more than 120dB. 150dB is very difficult to achieve with EQ’d sound waves. As soon as you EQ anything you’re messing with phase and the physical property of the wave form changes.
This was cool and dramatic.
I hope you meet your grandfather and I hope he adopts you.
Wow cool and dramatic
Big deal. I am a parent. I would go the fuck to sleep or just sit there. Parents know this is not a challenge.
WRONG!.....the world's loudest room is my dining room when trying to eat supper with my five young kids.
41 minutes world record? Seriously? I could easily do 10 times that. AND I would love it. You'd have to force me to leave
Heh…extroverts
Wow cool and dramatic!
Wow cool and dramatic! XD
I could do this *and* sit still.
That's chicken in the end not pork
How can you go insane? Quiet places are the best
Literally me with ADHD   This would cause a great anxiety to me I'd literally laugh,jump,Cry,scream or shout,I'd literally be super frustrated
My tinnitus is going crazy just thinking about this
DRAMATIC!!!
Pffft, that's the last thing that can make me insane. My house is silent 24/7.
i think i can break this record just need a sponsor to be there
Man sits in quiet room … Coming next week -man survives hoing to sleep in his bed …
Interesting how he is in the dark for an hour and when the lights get turned on...not even a wince of the eyes. 😑
Only extroverts would go insane in that room. Not me.
At last, something my deaf ass would excel at!
dramatic
How is oxygen passed into the room?
Calux did 10 hours in this box
Is this what death is like? Being consious, but no senses at all (smell, vision, hearing, touching)
Hey this is cool and dramatic.
this is cool and dramatic lol
WoW cOol
This is perfect for parents lol peace and quiet.
wow cool AND dramatic
I hate zoomer haircuts. This was triggering
As someone who has the fan running even in winter just for background noise, I would go nuts
I could do about a day in that room without food.
This is more about someone who  can't STFU for any amount of time and enjoy the silence...
Id hot box the shit out of it.
I really want you to have a grandpa. Subscribed!
You could of just fall a sleep, easy 10h.
lol I need to try one day
It’ not the most loud room , but the most reverberant , a total different thing. It exist in many laboratories. Anyway nothing special happen being alone in the anecoic chamber, it's just boring, extremely boring. You hear clearly natural noises of your body, that is all. I asked my professor to close me inside alone many years ago. Many researchers spend hours and hours inside that kind of rooms for job.
Pfftlooool  prob would've fallen asleep in the first 3 mins 😂 such peacefulness ahhh sleepy time
He talked about hearing your joints and ears and stuff, but what about the sound of pooping myself.  That would be fun.
you ARE dramatic and that was cool, like cool aha
My tinnitus’ triggered
I could beat the world record.
That pork chop actually looked really good
Weak people.  Trying being deaf.
I would love to try it, I'd get some much needed rest!!!😴
Very nice man you did wel!
Can literally hear a mouse fart 😅
wow thats so cool and dramatic Ryan!!
I have worked in facilities like this for hours during the night with only a flash light and never thought anything off it
If someone pay me, I would like to try to settle record.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Honestly the only challenge I can beat.
my room from 2 am to 5 am is quiet af bro wtf r u talking about ... everyday the same day
I'm from Middle East, I can vouch for 4:41.
I m ready for being In there world's quiettest Room
Where is it I want to break it
wow, cool and dramatic!!
I sat in room for 4 days and  it just gave me tie think 41mnd is not long
I would still hear my tinnitus so I'd be all good😁
My tinnitus would have quite a debate with me in there
But i thought this must be the quietest room, not darkest
"I can hear my own heart beat and my chest feels tighter than a camels butt in a sandstorm "😂😂😂 I lot it😂
I need to be in that room! I am a mother of a crazy screaming toddler!!! GIVE ME THIS ROOM!!!!
Is this room available at Amazon or ebay? I'd like purchasing one
Wow  cool dramatic documentary
I didn't think I would watch this all the way through... Ryan is a genius.
Surely he would be fine if the lights were on
Lol bit of a douche move for that guy to lie to you about the 'record' tbh..  : /
41 minutes psssssh. bring it ON. guarantee i could beat that
wow cool AND dramatic
I want take a nap in that room
wow cool AND dramatic!!
We do NOT keep our balance by "seeing the horizon and hearing things around us". Please Steve, educate yourself on the vestibular system.
So how does this compare to a typical sound proof booth?
I can do a whole day in here 🤷🏾‍♀️
WOW cool and dramatic! :D
Omg, I need to experience this, lol
was it necessary to have the lights out?
This was my dream since when I was a child. A complete quiet box where ever I can go when the world is too loud. But till today it is only a dream. But I think I could be in this room for a very long time.
Why ryan cool and dramatic.
I wear waterproof ear plugs and blind folds most of my days..  for spiritual purposes
Ok I at first judged but after the whole video I commend your amazing video
Imagine if he had to fart in this room
Lol I would've took a nap 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wow cool and dramatic yay
I had a similar experience on my birthday
:o
Was that a pork chop or a chicken breast 🥴 ???
1 hour and 26 minutes was the record not 41minutes. It was set two years ago and on video
really wanna visit that room one day
lets help him pass dr phil
Im an introvert so I think I could handle it but I don't sit still very long So probably not an hour idk but it seems interesting
Half an hour your body would start to sound louder
Wow that was super cool and dramatic
I would love to be in this room, but I'll probably just be in there for 20mins max...
One hour? I think I can manage 2 or more hours, but why does the light have to be off? Sitting in a dark room without doing something... thats has to be hard part for me.
I would stay in this room forever with a pillow and a mattress and covers i wish my room was like that
wow cool AND dramatic!!
I could do it for days
People keep saying it is a dream come true but actually humans even if you are introverted like me ...   We need interaction unless it is mentally unhealthy ......
Are you telling me its so quiet that even introverts can't make it ?
Boring.
wow cool AND DRAMATIC !
I understand that this room isn't that popular otherwise the world record would  go higher.
I would do taichi and meditate.
boutta throw my old roommate in this, mf use to run the AC nonstop even during the winter saying some bs like "I need it for the white noise I cant handle quiet"
Just subscribed good luck on grandpa phill
why turn off the lights tho?
Wow this was so cool and dramatic
It's getting hi GG h without substance but I would probably pass this because my T  is too high rn.
That pork chop looked like a chicken breast 🤔
i could stay here 2 weeks non stop
No thx I have anxiety just watching
Wonder how much it is to sleep in there for 1 night?
me- always dreamed about hearing the fluids in my body- heart beat, joint and all ....looking at this   *___*
Geez I would just hear that ringing in my ears and would make me crazy. I sleep with a fan every night no matter the temp outside because I need that constant noise. I even purchased rechargeable fans for camping to hang in the tent at night.
How hard is it to make your own noise for 30 minutes tho
imagine you're high in this room.
Deaf people: Am I a joke to you?
If he calls this survival... I'm extremely interested to see him surviving the zombie Apocalypse 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well it's no the quietest room with you yakking on in it 😂
My tinnitus would make that better for me. Maybe I should try to beat it
I want to sleep there
Ha try lookin in a mirror for 40 mins ya gonna be mad
In that room, I could hear the voices inside my head more clearly.
i can stay easily 24h with a camera in my hand
Me chomping on Popcorn 🍿 That's Not quiet enough
Me thinking about about this room: 🤤😴😇💤💤🛌👌🧞‍♀️🧚‍♀️🧘‍♀️ Me realizing I'll never have it: 💀😑🔫😭😡💔🤬🥺😭
i can do batter than u man
I want to see you be Dr. Phil grandson lmmfao headass 🤣😂👏🏾💯
What did Nucky Tompson say about the ability to sit in a room by yourself?
🤣🤣🤣 this is hilarious
World record is 41 minutes Me: lays down and falls asleep for the next 8-12hours 😎
When teacher finally had enough of chaotic students
I've got tinnitus, a few hours would be a piece of cake for me.
Introvert here. Where in Minnesota do I find this room? 🙂
Now this is where I want to record my videos without any destructions. ♣
All you need is to be sick of this world and the way the its going and that room is easy. Could kick it there till they kick you out 😆
Most people who do Vipassan will have no issues doing this.
Anyone watching this who is Autistic - as I feel like this is a sensation highly autistic children have to grow up with? Any comments?
Because it's silent doesn't mean you have to sit in the dark.
Imagine Recieving Powers Like Dr.Strange by Meditating in This Room 😎😎😎
Yeah buddy....! <3 That's the why senses of regular meditators sometimes gets elevated. - And why we sometimes (knowing ourselves) do what we have to do, to control the stimulus we immerse ourselves into, depending on what and who we interact with....
wow cool and dramatic
I live in the worlds quietest room for years, actualy more then 30 years...     I'm deaf 🤐
Ryan : this room will make you go crazy after 30 min    Quite kid: proceed to stay in the room in 1 whole year
That's the needed place to sleep in... Especially when you're exhausted! NICE!
"Wow. Cool AND dramatic” 🤥🤥🤥 😬😬😬
Asian students be like "Heaven"
A silent room would be a gift 🎁 I have tinnitus, I'm wondering if it would be magnified or minimilized in the room ?
Veritasium did it for more than an hour
If I sleep a few hours in that room, does it count?
Send a introvert there
I wouldn't last 5 minutes
Anyone can do any number of hours. It's all about how comfortable you are within yourself.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Wow what a cool and dramatic shot at 2:10!
You have to close your eyes and just go elsewhere in your mind. If you focus on the room itself and the quiet...that's where you run into problems.
Your weak to of survived something that poses no threat to anyone ever.
Me after watching this : I'd rather find a quiet place
Wow, cool and dramatic!
Room : and now I offer you the world's best "piece and quiet" experience my Tinnitus : Nope
wow cool AND dramatic!!!
the best place for smoking weed and concentrate
Imagine being there with a female   😉
I don't get how you go insane... Can't you just nap 🙄 Also people are just to dependant on devices, that's why they can't handle it.
That's how I feel in my holiday house in Sweden. 😂
I would sleep my ass off
all the poseur comments about beating a record that Ryan literally says in the video is a myth in the first place. 🤦‍♀️
Why only 40mins? Are you not allowed to sleep in there?
This is the content YouTube was made for.
Y'all this was really cool! I liked how dramatic it was lol
"pork chops" is the dismembered body of an innocent individual who fought and probably cried for his life.  Watch dominion.
When I was in school I had IBS and anxiety and I felt everybody in class could hear every noise my bowels and stomach made with caused more nervous stomach so it made me want to avoid quiet situations at all costs. This would have been literal hell for me.
Inmates would pass this with ease
I would love to sleep in that quiet room, after working my overnight shifts.  😴
Aaaayyyy welcome to Minnesota!!
I bet that pork chop tastes better at the end because it was rwally chicken lol
The passing out definitely fooled me 100% lol
Child try solitary confinement for 30 days at only 15
This is my dream 30 min no sound
I would love to actually do this 😁 I would want to try and break the record too
I did 6month down seg unit in jail..nice n quiet..good book..great..b a piece ov piss.🤔😅😂
The sounds...... of silence ......
Wow cool AND dramatic!!
People have reported starting to suffer from tinnitus after being in this type of room. I do NOT want that for anyone. It's horrible.
wow super dramatic
The volume of this vid is inversely proportional to its subject. Does Ryan have an ear condition ? Or an obsession ? Bit questionable that the experiment involves darkness. Isn't Ryan testing two things at a time this way ? Is it the world's quietist room or the darkest room ? Isn't it as quiet with the lights on ?
when i saw whats happening with this guy i though to my self he jsut dont know how to medidate, sit still ,control emotions hes in compulsive state where human body is driven by emotions and conciousnes is not strong enough to hold it im trying to pass this state and be more calm inside my self also ;p
What are these rooms for? Pardon: What´s "doing the pork chops" ? 6:17 *OHMYGOSH WHAT A GREAT GIFT TO ME - TRUE STORY* i immediatly wanted to watch the listed video "ASMR for men" but it would have taken me to long to figuere it out, and i couldn´t earch for it because i couldn´t remember the four letters...and direction,  so this backholded video cames first.

lmfao the dr phil non sequitur made me spit take my coffee like a freakin cartoon
And the pork chop lived vicariously through the boneless skinless chicken breast until he was eaten
I have a problem where I am both sound sensitive (so a decent amount of quiet is good for me) BUT total silence is awful. I know because I've had a pretty persistent ear infection requiring me to wear silicone earplugs in the shower. I HATE not being able to hear things properly, and it makes my body sound all weird and echo-y. It's not really total silence when your heartbeat is so loud and all the other obnoxious sounds.
This room  re creates the same atmosphere at Goodison Park.
I have been wearing earplugs to sleep for past few years. This room would be definition of heaven.
I am disappointed about this video
I could last 3 hours in this. Hell I already hear my body’s functions on a daily basis so that is nothing new.
*me the night before my exams
Lol I would  totally meditate for hourse in that room
Introvert people can stay in there for a day
Have u never been in exam hall??
I want that room in my house so quite and private
I’d just take a nap in there
That room would be a nightmare for me because u would only be hearing my tinnitus loudly
I'd only get worried if couldn't hear myself think anymore.
What if we put these walls on side of roads to reduce the noise ??!!🙄🧐🤨
I call bs lol If his second pork chop was that good you would have eaten more of it
Ryan in the quietest room for about 20 minutes: *...I* *am* *the* *experience* 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yeah dude.  I usually hate these stupid things, at least this is interesting.
I have tinnitus so there is no such thing as a quiet room for me, lol.
The goal at the beginning of this video was to sit in the quiet room for a certain amount of time.  There was no mention of turning the lights off.
lol
I'd set the record in that room and think I'll try it soon....I can't have enough quiet fr...
Oddly enough I'm wondering how LOUD my tinnitus would be in this room...
That room would have been my nightmare. I sleep with a radio on, laptop open right by the bed, and the light on my humidifier going all night. Can't do total quiet or dark due to severe claustraphobia.
Well, after 1 hour of no light he adapted well to the sudden light, maybe too well.
They would probably last much longer if they had something to do in there or even if the lights were on. Or someone not so energetic lol
I would spend my 45min there with singing my lungs out
this vid was longer than it felt
1:30 for those who don't want to hear the idiot ramble on and on and on.    And if you want to see the classic douchebag face, it's at 6:00
I need this room in my apartment.
Erm I have put earplugs in for 20+ years whilst having a pitch black bedroom to go to sleep. I have heard every gurgle my body makes, the sound of air going in and out of my nostrils, my pulse, my muscles moving and the extra pressure going through my veins whilst I move or the increased heart rate as I move. Then we have the cone flashes inside my eyes and the sleep jerks that happen before you fall asleep. This room would be my perfect place to sleep.
tbh I'd probably just fall asleep
Hotbox would be nice
In Le Mans (France) the university has an anechoic chamber. A group of the researchers decided to do a sleep in there. They all gave up before morning came.
So cool and dramatic!
2:08-2:18 Those were the best cool and dramatic shots I ever saw
Make my house like that. Bloomin noisy neighbours.
This was very cool and dramatic!
wow cool AND dramatic
WOW!!! SO COOL AND DRAMATIC!!!
Really
wow cool AND dramatic!!
wow so cool and dramatic!
The way it seems, the biggest problem being in that room was that he couldn't mess with his phone.
This reminds me of the Simpson's episode where the TV is broken and Homer starts shouting, "Someone turn SOMETHING on, I'm starting to THINK!"  How exactly is quiet maddening, unless you are a moron?
An easy record to break 😂😂
I going into Sage Mode
music at 0:12?
so so sorry my liked wasnt for pork
This must be the best place to rethink our life decision
You can lose your mind for being here too long. We're not built like that. Won't definitely work for long term otherwise it's almost deadly.
I dont believe the wr is 41 mins. What about people who go into sensory deprivation tanks? Surely that is the same?
I'm pretty sure rock concerts aren't 150 dB...
This was cool, and dramatic.
Love it
the quiet kids are laughing.. just wait to hear it
It was cool and dramatic 😜
For someone like me who gets  migraines and don't like taking pills this room is perfect
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's not hard ok surviving the world queries rom
LAME, the guy never shut up.
I think deaf people break your record every day. And they don't got to travel to do it.
wow cool AND dramatic!! :D
fun fact: i was front row at a kiss concert, and i did indeed suffer permanent hearing loss.
I want such a room for studying for my exams lol
I can live in that room,, i enjoy silence so much.,,  just gotta take my weed with me
I would definitely last in that place for years. HAHAHAHA. I really love isolated and quiet place. 😅😂
“I am the experience.”  New mantra.  Thx man ;)
You sound just like Jesse Eisenberg.
A meditator, would have no problem
Tinnitus is a huge advantage in this room
perfect place to take nap in.
Loudestvroom, alienation  makecyou crazy dummy. Bored litterally nothing to do
wow cool and dramatic
It is the plainest in the loudest room one must survive
Backwards bullshit. It's the Is emptiest, Smallest and loudest room one must survive
That's literally a world record? Sit a room for 41 minutes? Lmao I have tinnitus so I'd be fine lmao I'd literally just take a nap
"I am the experience". Nice. He's actually experiencing enlightenment but doesn't realize it. If he had gone deeper he would have realized he is "nothing" yet everything. 😆
It can get like that in deep desert, causes the mind to eat itself, can actually trigger enlightenment, realization of true nature.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
I could do over an hour easy. Meditation is the way.
Dude I too have a friend named Steve who looks like that !!! And same age too
I love quite you have no idea how pleased I will be in this room just no darkness tho
My tenitus would be deafening
I have tinnitus on my right ear, I get into quiet rooms annually for my check up and every time I thank God for ambiance noise otherwise the ringing in my ear would drive me nuts.
Some people are deaf so
Looks like Ludwig Dieter
i want to try this room.
Oklm I’m a sound operator and it’ll be fantastic to live without a sound (and eventually take a nap😂)
It's just the thing that normal people cannot be alone with themself for like 40 minutes anymore without smartphone or sth. Poor world.
Let's say I have access to drink and food and I must be in this room yes definitely something for me I hate humans and dealing with them gives me anxiety and mostly I'm depressed so this room is like paradise
Lmao that random grandpa dr.phil is too funny
i bet you all the money in my bank account that i could beat that record. This is coming from a distance runner and cycling enthusiast, someone that knows how to endure mental toughness for long duration of time.
I need that room ! 😂
oop lmao i had a music  class in that building it's wild to see you there
Silence must be heard.
How many people have attempted though.. 5 people ? I know I could probably stay in there for a long time.
To escape from my neighbor's music,bring it on.
For those with really bad tinnitus, wouldn't this potentially be the world's _loudest_ room?
I'd be like Legolas in that room, like 20 hours in: "I feel something. A slight tingle in my fingers... I think it's affecting me!"
Question : are you allowed a cellphone ?
Easy. I would just nap.
People last 41 minutes in the quietest room Deaf people:
Perfect room for psychedelics
Come at night and take a good nap/sleep ez world record
In this quiet room, you can hear your saliva gulping down your throat..
Oh that room would be fun with my tinnitus lol.
wow
so dramatic way cool
I bet i can do 2 hours
gay
Any cavers around here? cool video, obviously I don't have access to such room but I feel curious as caving can provide similar experiences of absolute dark and no noise depending on the case. I've been in situations where I shut off my lamps and waited for other people in 100% dark and no noise, it's so relaxing, but I know the mindset is different: being on a quiet room with no mission except lasting X time VS being on a quiet cave with the mission of going in / out, or waiting for the rest of the team.
what a weird record collection... and whats the deal with the mark ryden?
Silence is golden 👌
Those aren't veins lol...
Funny how some slightly more mature and intelligent YouTubers did the same thing, but without being such drama-queens about it.
A great place to make ASMR videos lol
hey . just imagine the time you die completely no noise and just dark
2:12 that was cool and dramatic!!
Not dramatic XD
Look like Gordon Ramsey.
Am I the only person that thinks that pork chop looks a lot like a chicken breast?
wow cool AND dramatic!
Wanna give a try.... must be amazing
that was a chicken breast, not a porkchop
I heard the person with 41 mind started seeing creepy allusions
Daredevil origin story… 👀
Wow! Cool AND dramatic!
People who hate PC fan noise: I WANT THAT ROOM
I would very much like to be in that room in utter darkness with a nice comfortable bed.
like you said. cool. and quite.
Sign my up
I wish I can be there i like being in quite place
Maybe the problem is this person couldn't stay still or quiet for 30 minutes under normal circumstances either.
An hour! I could stay in that room for DAYS!!!!
My panic disorder doesn't like this video.
He doesn’t put any links in the desc for this guy and his room :/
WOW THIS IS COOL AND DRAMATIC!
I would love to be in a space like this. I hate noite. Imagine spending hours meditating there!
I could do 3 days
This is BS.... .9 minutes in... Ooh wait I might be in trouble here. lol.
That pork chop looks so dry LOL
It was cool and dramatic Ryan.
2:10 the reason you went crazy is because your in the dark....you would have been fine if the lights were on
5:22 You sound so high right here.
That was cool and dramatics😂🤚🏾
I would love to take a bong hit and go in that room
It's bad enough you traveled on a plan in a pair of shorts and undershirt but to show up at someone's business still in those "little boy clothes" is beyond reproach.  CLASS is a thing of the past for Americans.
This would be an awesome meditation space! 🧘🏾‍♀️
This video is really cool and dramatic
that's literally hell for someone with ADHD
i'd probly fall asleep and beat that 41mins..
I can do that
It was cool and dramatic.
I think the ringing noise in your ear is what might drive some people crazy
This is essentially what sensory deprivation floating tanks are but without the water  Some describe it as having a really bad psychedelic trip, I want to do it one day after having scarfed down a heroic amount of shroomiesss! 🍄👽✨
Why am i scared
you're almost past dr. Phill in subs! KEEP GOING!
Many people dream of such a place. I think people just psych themselves out, especially people who need to be surrounded by noise, people, constant barrages of nonsense, etc. Give me a good book, I could chill for hours.
Not to totally bash this, but what does having the lights turned off have to do with a record of 'staying in the worlds quietest room'         If its to try put some fear into you, well that wasnt part of the name of the experiment.
lol no record
Do not try this at home 🏡
But why the darkness?
what if ur deaf
id just go to sleep on nyquil, 8 hrs later id hold the record.
They don't have sensory deprivation floatation tanks near you?
Indeed,he is the experience himself!!MIND BLOWN.
I work for professional Audio Studios so i'm used to such things. Of course most studios are not that absorband but even such a room is awesome to be in. But most high end recording and mastering rooms are very absorband. I just love it when a room sounds "dry".
That room would be the best to sleep in
interesting I once spent a night in a deep flat cave on Canary Islands and this reminds me of that night. It was weird because of my own perception.
How did I ended up here?
I wonder what it’s like to record music in here. Perhaps you’d be able to hear your mistakes a lot easier?
I would of fall asleep in there😭🥴
Yakkatiyakkatiyakkatiyak.... STFU dude.  Enjoy the silence
The pork chop looks a lot like chicken
Front row at a rock concert 150dB?? Really? Once, maybe.... I blame Manowar 🤘 Front row is actually not overly loud anyway as you're not in line with the PA system.
I have loved sensory deprivation since a child. It's great to shut everything out sometimes and dive in..
Omg why is this guy soo funny 😂😊coffee pork chops noises
Elevated 👌😂😂😂
This is how I want to live my life!!!! This is Lit!!!
I worked for a company that made tornado sirens and they built a similar room to test the sirens inside and not disturb other business. It's so quiet you can hear your own heartbeat and hear the blood moving in your veins.
Considering where I live, I'd move in there tomorrow....adding the darkness is cheating, though.
WoW! How cool and dramatic this video was! 😁
He has almost 5 million people who subscribe and watch his videos, yet I find him to be obsessed with himself and annoying. Maybe I don't belong on this planet.
Yeah I was gonna say, that record sounds really off.  A lot of people would probably want to stay in such a room for hours at a time no problem. Just for the experiance alone, plus I can't see any actual health reasons as to why it wouldn't be possible to just stay there indefinitely. Then of course theres people who can enter a meditative state easily, they would be able to stay in there for ages easy.  Pretty cool though, the video and the room.
Completely missed the point about "dressing up".
Dramatic? YES Cool? NOPE
Wow....you walked on water or can fly 🤦‍♂️...you want a cookie  smh I bet you won't sky dive.but you can sit on a chair and feel like you made the world spin the other way around lol you tough and live life on the edge🤣
"if you go into a quiet bar they  both taste more subtle because your brain isn't processing the noise." This guy may have a Z80 CPU inside his head. 🤣
I think a lot of people in the comments are underestimating how it is in absolute silence.  It is insane to put simply, you only know what it is if you have experienced it but it is the easiest way to go mad
Clear quartz, amethyst, turquoise and leave me there😁
why did that pork chop look like a chicken fillet? i think that quiet room messed me up by proxy
wow, cool and dramatic
wow cool AND dramatic!!
If they make a film of it Simon and Garfunkel should do the soundtrack.
2:24 My veins are grossing me out? (sounds like a white chick lol) Maybe 2:20 was what you meant?
Perfect place for me. Yes please.
wow this was so cool and dramatic
I love silence...id break that record with ease.  Give me a place to piss and ill stay in there for hours.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Wow cool and dramatic
well you didn't shut up so it doesn't count.
I would be happy to ear the silence. Experiencing  God's voice.
Silence is loud
I mean...what do deaf people do? They're not going insane..
Btw jusr like how noises make you taste less, i use that to be able to eat my mom's sometimes-forgot-the-salt or oops-added-salt-twice meals
Well he won't go crazy if he had tinittus right?
dude became daredevil for 30 minutes
I wish negative dB would cure my tinnitus ☹️
I think he was hearing weird sound from ear bcoz of less air
Now again with a heroic mushroom dose!
wow cool AND dramatic!!
what's the song in the beginning of the video?
Imagine what sitting in that room with tinnitus is like.
wow so cool and dramatic!!
Yeah, dramatic😂
nice.
Great title, so misleading , like you never heard of meditating + the end part was soooo DRAMATIC i almost died
40 minutes? that's it?
Cool place to chant omm
World’ quietest room, talk non stop all the time 😂
You got th same feeling when you climb a high mountain ( after 5500m for me)
I'm vegan, now
"wow cool AND dramatic!!" :(
I feel like some advanced meditators should sit in this video and see if they could break the record. Some sit in caves so it could be cool to see how long they could last.
I can stay for hours 😎
so cool and dramatic!
This sounds like a dream come true, no pun intended.
Imagine smoking and start tripping in that room
steamounk
Can you make noise? I’ll fix that room very quickly.
"wow cool AND dramatic!!"
I wish you would have took it a little bit more seriously and not recorded himself in the room because when you're distracting yourself time goes by way faster to accomplish goals like this versus sitting there in complete silence soaking it all in with no camera in your face.
Haram🤮
Wish i could sleep in this room....
What about deaf people?
Hi
Now try a sensory deprivation chamber.
Meditators & monks like “ok 🙄 “
Interesting...Okay Ryan you sold me. I'll hit the button.
its cool and dramatic
FUNNY  I  LOVE  STRANGER  THINGS
This is really just part 2 of the Rubber Johnny video by Aphex Twin
1:22 The Killer Boy Rats
I subbed, because I want Dr. grandpa Phil for you.
Ryan: I beat a 1 hour record inside the world's quietest room  Deaf people: *i'm about to end this man's whole career*
Not the 2 word response emails😳
I’d be happy to sleep in this room!
Every: this room is so quiet it makes you insane... Introvert: *pathetic* .
this is bullcrap, I could sit in there for like 8 hours minimum
Would have been nice if u could shut up sometimes. The record should be done in silence and sitting totally still. U got some serious ADHD.
ADHDer here, where can I get one these rooms? But with lights, please.
I live in our capital I would kill for a quiet room, I would beat them all 🤣
I'd love to do it! I volunteer a study.
wow cool and dramatic
I work construction and one job we did was at an older school that had the original acoustic tiles still glued to the structural ceiling but had a drop ceiling with acoustic tiles installed later, so there was an 18" high space with acoustic absorbing tiles on each side. It was really really quiet and it was very anxiety inducing at first.
wow cool AND dramatic!!   i would love to test this out too tho, it must have been an experience you just cant get by watching and what's funny to me is, that it seems like you're "tripping" thanks to the stimuli (or lack thereof) in that room
i would go insane because of my tinnitus
wow very cool and dramatic (:
Wow this was so cool and dramatic!!
Hmm... Does it have to be dark in there?
Wow so cool and dramatic!!
the pork-chop is a lie!!!
"wow cool AND dramatic!!"
That pork chop was a chicken breast.
is this life
I can stay for days even I can live in that room...
The only reason people "go nuts" is because the people saying it are used to the constant, incessant drone of cities.  Anyone who lives outside of them would be far better equipped to go into one of these rooms, as you can hear your own heartbeat in your head any time you stop to listen. Just that city people need the city din - seen it myself with others, first hand. This video, where ha can't stop making noise proves it. Totally null and void.
I can stay there the whole day (but only thing is not to switch off the light :'))
Don't go in there if you have a tinnitus.
Can I try that? I can be really quiet sometimes so, I wanna try
I respect the fact that you added some blur to that committed text at 0:14. This is what i live for.
they should improve the quality of the voices. Maybe the acid tones of us of A's accent makes me more and more untolarant to it.
wow so cool and dramatic
I wish to sit there and hear my body out
If I had to describe this video, which I dont nor was I coached on what to say, I would say it was cool and dramatic if that makes sense.
I have tinnitus.  There is no such thing as a quiet room for me.
Very effective when yoU plugged into headphones 🎧..I recommend everyone use headphones..
The content here seems too YouTubey and like it's meant for dumb people but the room itself is interesting
ONLY A LITTLE OVER 1MIL TO GO!!!! If you don’t subscribe to get this guy a grandpa, you might j be the grinch.
wow cool AND dramatic!
i'd have the nicest sleep in here 😻😻
i'd love to do this and just meditate
My video camera makes a little noise.
i wanna go toooo
Funkin exaggerating stuff.
Survive?!?!?!?  I only wish my room was that quiet.
wOw CoOl and dRamatic
As a guy living in apartment building with awfully noisy neighbors stomping and banging on my ceiling at 2 am and 6 am every night, I dream of spending some time in such a room and finally get some undisturbed sleep. That's the best retreat I can imagine.
Well, you should not have been talking at all in that room.  Also, sitting in a chair in a quiet room instead ,say, taking a pillow and laying on the floor, definitely shortens the amount of time you COULD have stayed in that room.
I only subscribed so you can meet your future grandpa:)
Wow cool AND dramatic!!
Just a min ..what if I go there and my brain starts it's own negative self talk and I listen to it all...
Kind of reminds me being in the woods hunting.... The quiet is insane
Will introverts survive there? I want to go...
Looky nooky uoooook
Let me stay there on your so called quiye room.. .. Taena i wanna sing my heart out..
Let me stay there on your so called quiye room.. .. Taena i wanna sing my heart out..
cool amd dramatic
All moms are wondering how much
I will be ready to be there for 3 hours
Turn the lights on!!! Quietest room not darkest!
Why are you dressed as a schoolboy!
Everyone in the comments: *WOW THATS CRAZY*     literally my brain when i saw the thumbnails:    shinnie. shini kin. shinji kinnie
lololol the Dr. Phil bit was legendary!!
Trying sending an introvert there
How many people were in this room before?
What's the name of the song that's playing from 7:14 to 7:30 ??? *Edited* to say I found it.  It's "Heart of Courage (No Choir)" by Thomas Bergersen.
making noise and moving completely defeats the purpose
(sus)
These rooms should be open to the public. I would pay £10 for 1 hour to experience this.
Quiet place 3 will be shot in that room and it will be very boring.
Me being FREAKING out about hearing my own heart and having tinnitus basically every night before sleeping, I thought of this room and how much it would freak me out and like 2 days ago and the YT algorithm decided to present me this gem
I want one like that room at my home, it's so quite and peace. Just set up the alarm if the times up 🤤
Even in the quietest place you can hear your own heartbeat and your breathing, so there’s always some sound.
That's the same experience the astronauts must feel inside their spacesuit.
my dream room, the quietest room, it's good for meditation, can you please help me with the room design and the materials needed for the room? please
He couldn't even shut his mouth for more than 10 seconds
Just enjoying the comments! 😀
How can i rent it?
If only Siddhartha Gautama could walk into that room, he would have locked himself from the inside & never come out like ever & attained nirvana over and over again. ❤️❤️❤️
I need this room to sleep every night
Great for my meditation and yoga
But why is the room dark???
The guy can’t just keep quiet
People feel like going insane after 30 min? Anyone who meditates would probably not want to get out 🙂
Annnd I just subscribed  * Plin * +1
“All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.” Blaise Pascal
Its definitely hard for a extrovert like you don't dont shut up.... 🤣 Definitely never been quite n sat by yourself... Meditation n spirituality.. is too far for you rn
Wow cool and dramatic indeed     Totally
I'm so happy with this YouTube recommendation. And scared at the same time
I think I would be able to stay there with no problems. I just want a bed. I have my imagination.
Bring on the  teacher 😂 who wishes this type of decorum
wow cool AND dramatic!!
That's pretty funny to watch him........I'm deaf since birth and that's what I hear nothing 24 hours a day and I will always sleep in peace lol.
Woulda been nice if you were quiet…..
I know you all didn't just bring in the Demogorgon😂😂😂
It was difficult to judge cos you kept making noise, moving about, joking.
Lol 😆but was cool and dramatic 👍
the humming sound takes the better of you. Those with Tinnitus might go uncomfortable.
azan insomniac ths is xactly wat hpns 2 me very dam x i try 2 go 2 sleep. i fnd xternl sounds xcurciating (like i can hear th grass gro!) whl silence is loud az hell, xcentuating internl sounds, like blood rushing... so yea, white noise (a fan) weed n jack daniels r essential 4 my survivl.
A best place to sleep
Ears go Eeeeeeeeeee
Waw
Maybe Hell isn't a Fire and Brimstone but complete darkness and silence.  Maybe the ultimate punishment for selfishness is an eternity of living with one self.
If it's in the dark, then isn't it sensory deprivation, not just hearing deprivation? So if you were in there with the lights on, wouldn't it be quite different..
WOW very cool and dramatic 😁👍👍
Extroverts: that's insane! I couldn't do that!   Introverts: peace is always a choice. That room would be a heaven for us.
People with tinnitus be like: This is hell
I'd probably fall asleep lol
weak man
how is it possible to get negative dB? isnt that like negative weight?
I wonder how the experience in this room compares to sensory deprivation tanks
This experience would be better in a comfy chair
So he goes all this way, travels to this room to break a world record thaaaat really isn't a world record and so his trip was all for nothing. Ok.
Bro your a pile of meat pal substance lol
A monk would live there. I hate this guys YouTube videos. Only if there was a way to completely block him on my account.
41 minutes is nothing I just wanna sit there and enjoy the silence from the world
The topic is good but the energy of this video is so negative, you personally are so repelling, I wish I could negative-subscribe. Maybe your other content is any better, but I will never find out.
IM SUBSCIRBING FOR DR. PHIL
Wow so cool and dramatic 👍
wut?
Doctor Phil videos? Bullshit
I want to take acid in that room. Kid Dr. Phil is Gay man, what's that say about you?
Actually I worked in a record center a couple years ago where the warehouse was FULL from top to bottom with paper files and cardboard. You would walk down long halls and rows of file walls, this place was like a labyrinth. Because of the amount of paper, all the sound was dampened and sounded exactly like this. My boss would talk to me from the end of the hallways and it sounded like she was talking through headphones or something. This took a while to get used to how absurd this was. But it was a nice, boring job, where we were allowed to listen to music if we had earphones at least. :)
Chiropratic ASMR 😂👌
I want a room like this 😻
Only 41 minutes? I would have no problem breaking that record.
You had a really rare chance to experience pure silence and yet you couldn't stop talking and moving.
I love this part of the vid 5:13
I did something similar to this called a sensory deprivation tank where you float in a tank full of salt water so your completely buoyant in pure silence and darkness and I literally started to hear like whizzing shooting laser noises and weird pingy noises and started seeing all these crazy lights while floating inside of the tank.
I would like to sleep there, i only sleep like two hours a day with all the  street sounds, i need thaaat
This was annoying to watch. Between the neck cracks, the knuckle cracking and him saying he passed out, omg
I would have went to sleep
It was quiet til u started yappin'
An introverts man cave.
Most parents will find 2 hours in this room seems too short. Most of us will fall asleep within seconds. We can easily stay 6-8 hours and if there's a bed 10 maybe?
plz comment "wow cool AND dramatic!!" :(
It's so quiet that you can hear the most quiet kid in the classroom
Not sure if I missed something, but why are you in the Dark? Its a quiet room not a Dark room.....LMAO...
This was cool.. and dramatic
sleep i always sleep
You crazy 😂😂
You told your dad you didn't like his pork chops😂
The part where you said it was like looking at the ultrasound of somebody's baby😂😂😂 you crazy
image putting a crazy person in there
He should market  these as meditation rooms for rich yuppies in Beverly Hills.
Lol what you literally achieved self realization when you realized your perspective changed to the seer and not the seen!! Amazing haha
there is a spirit next to you.
Why does it have to be dark?
NO different than sleeping without a fan.
All this only to fully enjoy a prok chop
Wow cool AND dramatic!!!
Wow cool dramatic
Dude can't stop still and in silence, it's so uncomfortable 😂 Didn't feel peaceful AT ALL!
i would just sleep there, people at my house makes lots of voices 😂✨
Райан Трахан, hi from viewers from russia)
wow cool AND  dramatic!!
I'd be willing to spend 2 days straight in there
its the same thing a deaf or blind person experiences . the other senses get enlightened. cool
Does the record require that the subject be awake?  If not, I could break that record with my eyes closed, literally.
"wow cool AND dramatic!!"
A good room for improve my voice.
Forget it. Indian sadhus can stay for days.
Immediate permanent hearing loss in the front row of a rock concert? Sure about that?
Imagine farting in that room after spending some time in it.
Not quiet if you talk
I wish one day I can get even a quarter of your views...you're all blessed up brother 💯 God bless you even more 💯
Can someone tell me please what song is in the video? 1:14
what is the music at 7:31 ? thanks :)
wow cool AND dramatic 🤣
It was cool and dramatic 😁
Low class people love to make noises. To become high class, one needs to quit the noise.
Wow so cool & dramatic
I would go to sleep ;)
lol
i can break your record i can stay one day. please reply
Imagine right after he gets out someone blows airhorn near his ears,       Eardrums go boom boom.
I can do that tbh because im used to sitting completely still in train for 6 hours straight lol.
Now survive the worlds loudest room.
Everyone: that's just crazy! Me(student): A great place to study! :D
Having tinnitus, I can stay in that room for a heck of a lot more than a measly 41 minutes. Easy peasy lemon squeazy
""But Imma touch you right"
Meditation I can do it for 5 hours minimum
As an introvert I need this. Ya'll noisy as hell
Wow cool and dramatic :D
Wow cool and dramatic
it would probably make me insane
Wow! Cool and dramatic
Himalayan sadhus (saints) would make wonders in that room.
Could have been an interesting video.... if this kid wasn't so self-centered... lame 🙄
I can survive this . give me a oppurtunity
Wow, cool AND dramatic
Was is it difficult because it was quiet or because he was in the dark?!
Take a nap
I knew you were gonna beat that record when you said you were 6 min in when it was 10, and you said 12 min when it was 31, that confirmed my guess for me.  I bet you could have done two hours💯💯
Really? Can’t be by yourself. Dude, everyone can spend 8 hrs by them selves  just by sleeping.
It's  exactly how i live with my pulsatile tinnitus.
I would love to meditate in here to clear my head
For your next video can you try to survive being shot?
Finally " introvert found a place where you can cultivate your mind and contemplate".
You don’t realize all the little tiny noises you hear when you think things are perfectly quiet. Even the little clicks on my modem make noise if you tune into it.
Just fall asleep 💤
Wow that's cool and dramatic!
When my kids were little, and super noisy, I could have spent at least a weekend in there
pathetic
wow cool and dramatic
after enduring a whole year terrible neighbors, i think im in.  one of them is gay and screams like a chicken wen theyre havinf fun and the other always sing no matter the time of the day or night. ahhhhhhhhh
This is cool and dramatic.
That pork chop was as dry as the Namib Desert, your dad did you wrong.
Wow cool and dramatic
Ryan, you should now spend an hour or so in a flotation tank.  Almost the same sensory experiences plus a sense of weightlessness!
You play nice with Dr. Phil, he's not as smart as the other kids.
Cool and Drimadic
Can I get some info on how to build such a room myself? I want one. I am serious
Idk but I could spend days in that rooms
wow cool AND dramatic
I could stay in there for 4 to 6 hours.
I work like kindergarten teacher and I NEED  that room 😋😍
this was cool and dramatic!
Very cool and dramatic. So dramatic I almost fell off my chair. So cool, I got frostbite. 😂 (British sarcasm…you’re welcome)
how do unsubscribe from someone i am not subscribed to
It was cool and dramatic
Cool and epic WOW
IT MAYBE BE KIND OF HARD BUT I THINK I WOULD HAVE TRIED TO JUST FALL ASLEEP AND KNOCK OUT WITH TRYING TO BE THAT CALMED AND RELAXED LOL
I hate noise. I would go in this room and still take earplugs....
I'd have expected a floor that looks like those walls and ceiling, with a steel mesh above it to walk on.
they shoud make a prison like that, bet people would think twice hahaha
perfect.What more can one highly introvrted me,need in this world?😂
This: 41 minutes in quietest room My school: 8 hour detention in the quietest room
Switching the lights off.. was necessary..??
Cool and dramatic
Cool and dramatic
Wow cool and dramatic. Why they turn off the light tho??
Steve Harringon in 35 years
it would be amazing to be in that room i would be able to sleep for once
Introverts, it's our time to shine
Definitely Anxiety inducing.
Every home should have  room like that, that's something for the future
2:15 Pls*
Lol believe me,if my lil brother went there,it will be like a heaven for him. (Only if he can bring his laptop🧍🏻‍♀️) He's so freaking sensitive to sound,if he hear our 1 y/o sister cried,he will give a lil smack💀
I wonder if farts sound any different.
I love to be in a quitest room  I am a introvert so I like to be alone and quiet
Cool and dramatic  😎
When u are in the middle of the karroo here in sa, the silence is literally deafening, u make a noise on purpose because you want to make sure you haven't gone deaf. It's the true beauty of being away from everything.
This was  so cool and dramatic.
I bet most of indian viewers thinking about meditation in this room right from starting  like ME 😊
I immediately subscribed after that Dr Phil thing 🤣
Pretty sure it's not a big deal at all :).
Is it that bad?! Why I can bear more than that
Pish! World's loudest room! Anyone who's managed to eat an entire meal in most of the trendy restaurants in London would laugh in the face of that.
the fact that there's no lights just made this more terrifying
I wish they explained how they made the room so quiet.
I wish to be in that place for eternity.
The sounds of the ear are called Tinnitus. These are made by the Cochlear membrane on the impulses given by Central Nervous System which indicate silence.
7:17 that sounded like Elon musk is talking 😆
tbh i am confidence that if ever i go with that place i could beat his record bcs as a people who always in the house I sometimes survive in a whole day without doing something and just sitting on a chair zooning out lol but ofcourse i need food inside for that whole day lol
I'll break that bullshit 41 min record with ease!!! I have money backers and will put every cent i have and can borrow on what I've wrote above...
If you relax you can hear the harmonic resonance of your current awareness. In other words how happy you are. The way we anthropomorphized birds to sound. Funny I've never heard a sad bird.
Any reason it also had to be the worlds darkest room?
This makes me want to put sound absorbing panels like that in my bedroom.  Then I wouldn't have to wear earplugs to sleep!
Can be in there for 60 minutes+
Not me wondering if that's what death feels like Total silence FOREVER
It’s the Two Steps From Hell at the end that really got me. Solid choice
“plz comment “ wow cool AND dramatic!!”:(“    Ok there you go
Wow cool and dramatic! 😍😍😍
I record each night in a silence room. I've been doing it for a couple years now. I have gotten intouch with the inner language of my body.
Ok, if ever I manage to put some money aside, that's definitely how I'll build my bedroom.....well I snore very loud....not sure if it's a good idea as I might, with my heightened hearing, finally hear my self snoring during my sleep
Just 45 minutes! I’ll give you 45 years instead! Just leave me in that room with food and I’ll gladly settle in peace.
Put a monk in there
“It’s entertaining “
Just yell chopapy
Your video is baloney. There's no negative decibels as 0db is absolute silence. Besides, I'd love to be in such a room for an hour, no sweat.
It seems like a true joy to me. Me and thoughts talking to the Lord in true peace
I'm gonna be honest if I was in there I would just take a nap-
It was cool & dramatic.
WOW 👏 😮 COOL 😎 AND DRAMATIC
That was cool and dramatic
This room for recording artists 👌🏾
this is cool and dramatic ...
wow cool AND dramatic!
Haters be like: "Thats just noise suppression"
What if I think very loud  Would it be heard outside?
loved the stranger things ref
I could be there forever. That room could help me to sleep, to think, to learn, to write my book... hm... the room of my dreams. ❤
Imagine unfortunately farting in that room lol...😂😂
So cool
me:just go to sleep bro you will beat the record if you are unconscious cause you wont be able the hear any sound
Wish I could study there for my project !
Silence is the best way to connect to your heart thus your true self. The mind and the ego obviously are very noisy aspects of Our earthly life. You need to learn meditation.
It's better than feeling empty when ur surroundings is noisy
I have Autism with hypersensory perception. I wish I could rent this room and live in it forever.
To a deaf person this room would make no effect.
Will try this once in life time 😀
I would be a day in this place. I hear the voices in my head.
Very cool n dramatic bro...I envy u visiting ther.Salute
why does the world's quitest room have to be dark? that was not part of the challenge!
wow cool AND dramatic!!
i wan to create lik 1 million more accounts ligit just so you can have dr.phil as your grandpa XD
It's like being in a Travelodge hotel.  Those hotels have thick windows and are always super quiet.
How much can I make for an hour  ?
I like how he actually misspelled permenant
I'd go insane in the world's loudest room
Nice effects 😎
😂😂
Somebody stole this video for tiktok and got double the views and millions of likes 💀
i would sleep…
Tinnitus though? It's never gon' be quiet 😩
🤣🤣🤣🤣 you are funny
Beat Dr Phil!
you can really hear the quietness
If you have to go to a clinic for a BERA (brainstem evoked response audiometry) test to check your brain stem function, it can last up to two hours in such a room, and you won't be in any danger. It's just uncomfortable. Next video. Education works.
alot of meditators will break these record easily..
Maybe it’s an autism thing but I can almost always hear the whirring sound of my ears under other sounds. Like the sound you hear when your head is submerged in still water
5:13 🤯
I'm sure that was a chicken breast!
this feels like a netflix show
That was cool and dramatic!
Very cool & dramatic.
Lock me in. I beg you
wow cool AND dramatic
*Me going into worlds quietest room.....2 mins later.....Snoring....Lots of Snoring. I'm tired yall!!*
Lol that's some people's dream
I want a room like this in my house 🤣
Maybe one day this what we all gonna experience when we die & alone inside our grave...
WoW cOol aNd DraMatIC VIdeO
This is cool and dramatic!
Sounds like a good time to dissociate 😌
I want yo try it
This is what I need for my videos once a day!  40 mins is perfect once a day to record!
You could just sleep and spend a good 7 hours in that room -- would've been refreshing.
Good luck with having your first grand papa. It must have been fan staying in that quite amazing room.
I wonder if this quiet room will cure my tinnitus?
I would be so bored
I think your video may have given me a splitting headache.
is the room haunted
schisma
You cant take 8 minutes in a silent room? What a wuss lol
Haha easy I can stay there for 3 days
Sounds like a dream come true
Ok, this video is full of falseness. You could stay HOURS in there if only you could see something that distracts your mind. And it's tipical american saying "the x-est of the world" just because they think to be at the centre of all (ignorance). In facts I bet there are places more quiet and more louder than those two in this planet.
You can hear the voices of your ears and body but can you hear the voice of your soul and inner consciousness, if can't then it cannot be the quietest room of the world. the place where you can hear the voice of your soul and inner consciousness is your body it is your abode of your soul.  Om Shanti, Love and Peace from India.
This was cool and dramatic.
i want to go there....
Imagine locking people with tinnitus  in there 😱
Just take a nap. Relax for once, geez
I honestly didn't understand why the room had to be completely dark. I could withstand the quietness but definitely not pitch black darkness.
Hard to endure because there's nothing to do? How many people went 10mins without looking at their phones nowadays. I bet you can easily stay a few hours with a muted iphone
41 minutes? lol
wow that was cool and dramatic lmao
Nobody Him cracking his neck Me cracking my neck  😂
I want to try this 😍
"How to break world record of most time spent inside world's quietest room?" "Take a nap".
Can anyone get a chance to experience that ???? I would love to go there and I'm sure I will break all records..... I wished I could get a chance to experience that.....
Imagine an person with tinnitus going in that room, I have tinnitus and by just being inside an sound proof room is an wierd experience. I can't study in noisy environments, so this would be nice. Yea you can try and focus on other things, but it's just really.............wierd, and annoying 😐. I have gotten used to the sounds that I hear in my ears, but it just being amplified x100 times. Must be torturous.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Wow, cool AND dramatic!
It was cool and entertaining Ryan.
subscribing so you can have grandpa dr.phil
Everything that stimulates you takes away other subtle things that stimulate you. He said this line while showing a pic of the stranger things demon eating and drinking. That was a bit distracting in listening to the point and also proving the point.
cool & epic 100%
i would glad to stay there for a day,so peaceful..haha..
When Gen Z’ers discover things other generations have already known, when your parents send you to the room and say “Not another word”.
why is no on3 talking about the scream in the queit room💀
Is this a joke? 40 minutes in the quietest room is a record?!
Why wouldn't we all appreciate the quite in our lives?
My anxiety😨
i guess thats how it be when u in a coffin underground
This sounds like heaven.
This was cool and dramatic 🙃
It doesn't have to be dark. Let their be light and let the environment be silent/quiet 🤐🤫
I want to be in that room so badly right now
He still has no idea of the meaning of the QUIET room. He can't shut up.
I thought it'd be easy. That actually looked pretty intense.
Hi, found you today. Subscribed just to get Dr. Phil here.
yo dormiría feliz en un cuarto así
Wow, cool AND dramatic!!!
wow cool AND dramatic...    Thats sad :(
I'd survive hours. The sounds of my raging tinnitus will keep me entertained
This is every producers dream.
I wanna try this but I'm claustrophobic...
I could sort my entire life in there, excellent idea 💡
I would love to be a in quiet room
This guy sounds like Tom Holland. LoL
DR PHILL WILL BE YOUR GRANDPA WILL
that was sorta anticlimactic but for some strange reason pleasantly enjoyable..maybe the room i'm in is quieter then i thought
He’s cheating by talking.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
is it that much hard to spent an hour in that room..? i dont think so.. i think its a opportunity
yeah but you should go there without camera and light, these can emmite sounds
pork chop is actually chicken lol
I can understand how a person who can't sit still and stfu for 30 seconds wouldn't be able to survive this room. This room is a dream come true for me.
I would have just went to sleep. 🙄 after all when your sleeping that's the most silence one gets. 😴
Yep I need that place to study
Um, i'd do almost anything to spend an hour or overnight in this room. Just give me 7 pillows and a good air mattress. 💤  I'd stay in the loudest room too to perfect my vocals 👌🏽
I don’t think it’s difficult
Im a very quiet person and I guess I can handle this and meditate
That’s all I want, a quiet room
Dr. Steve: How did you last 3 hours in the quiet room?!?  Me: I took a nap.
wow cool AND dramatic!!
can be a good place for meditation
Would love to sleep there 🥴🥴😌🥱
I just take my book and I would just read for 5 hours in this room.
Since am an introvert I live alone I can spend 4 hours in that room
Such an awesome place to meditate!
Wow cool AND dramatic
Sorry but I will have to be frank here.. You make too much noise by your actions while in there. I would like a refund or a new try where you actually stay quiet in the room for 41+ minutes then review it when you come back out.  Sorry. But it's not the quietest room if you make noise.
I want to do this
It doesn't say you don't survive it. it says it drives you insane. So you are crazy now.
This would be great when you live next to really annoying neighbors ☹️
Wow so cool and dramatic
How come the room in the thumbnail looks nothing like the actual room in the video?
i can sit in that room for couple of year if you can somehow supply food and drinks to me...
but if someone fall asleep? 🤔
I think that the video will be better without music 👍
So it’s like being deaf on accident
Wow, cool and dramatic!
yess its cool 👍
Wow cool and dramatic
back in the 50s or 60s a guy in oklahoma city lasted 16 hours in a sensory deprivation pool
I would probably have a panic attack. Getting nervous just watching this. Maybe if the lights were on I would feel better. You must start to feel disoriented.
Could you take a nap in this room?
Wow! Cool and dramatic 😎!!
YouTuber learning how to be with himself lol

Matt Murdock's favorite room
Is it still the World's Quietest Room if you're still talking in it?

Me who can sleep in the quiet room🙂
The quitest room is the best place to sleep
Can take naps in this room. Would be so damn good.
Steve is hilarious. I love him already.
Imagine you became later in your life deaf and blind together! What a horrible thought. :(
This is my experience of being introvert 🥶
And I feel like this room is for me 😌😌😌
The quietest room is the introvert's alone time paradise and the worst place for extroverts
Legends say that we can hear the sound of our heart beat and blood plumbing🤯🤯🤯
If I can find such a quite place to meditate
Wow cool and dramatic! Definitely
🤯 hearing your blood flowing
Imagine if Indian was thier 🤣
wow cool AND dramatic !!!!
Do you have to be in the dark though?

Only problem with it is that the voices in my head will be louder. :P
Wow dramatic

why r u holding ur ears in the thumbnail?
Is that music playing at the end from a Transformers movie?

a meditator could spend hours in that room listening to the inner sound.
i subscribed so u can get in touch with your future grandpa💪🏼💪🏼😂
are you telling me people don’t normally already hear their own ear noises?
Why would you want to be adopted by the Man Traitor?
Would it not count if you just go in and go to sleep.
this is heaven for us that meditate
I'ma make sure I'm super exhausted before I get there so I sleep once I get in there. 8 hours straight done. 😂😂
WOW!!! THIS WAS SO COOOOLL AND SOOO DRAMATIC 😭🤣
I'm not sure the quiet would bother me so much as the feeling of claustrophobia  I'd get in that enclosed space with no windows.
This is the most cool and dramatic video
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Wow cool and dramatic
Wait, veritasium have a world record of approximately 1 hour and he could have gone longer but it wasnt making any sense and nothing was making him crazier or something so he just walked out.
I would rather have a bed in that room and sleep. (I like a quiet room).

"Wow so cool and dramatic"

Screaming in th loudest room sounds like a soul's literal cry for help out of the hell
Vanya: ha, now you know how it feels  (TUA reference)

Just try Prison, people.  Disrespect the Sheriff and you're in the hole.  Get a grip, failures.

He doesn't believe he'll be crazy.... first 5 seconds thinks he is an avenger xD
wow, cool AND dramatic
wow
I wonder... how well people adept to meditation would handle this room think a Buddhist monk / hermit / Islamic person praying. Or a martial artist passing the time with solitary training. Or a deep thinker like a Philosopher or a physicist, entertaining themselves by purely thinking of ideas.
I'd definitely go and live in there if it means my tinnitus would stop bothering me as soon as I get into that room... but of course, I know that it'll just get louder.
this is how cats hear
I so wanna go there
even i can hear you are hungry XD
So all deaf pple are crazy?
Who’s ears were hurting to just watching the video
Ha! This kid likes dr phil..... I'm out.
Cool and epic
For the last 25 years, people have had to endure "music"  (otherwise known as distracting noise) while trying to listen to instructional videos, documentaries, actors' dialogue in movies, and on and on.  Someone this person's age would understandably have a hard time with any kind of quiet.  I don't think folks as a whole really realize how inundated with invasive noise every day life has become, and now there's a whole generation of people who don't know any other way.  It's a sad state of affairs.
woW cool and dramatic
I would sleep there and beat all your records.
and my classroom ∞ dB
I would love this room for sleep 🛌 I use earplugs every night to drown out any noise. This room would be a breeze to conquer.
Ears: EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEWEEEEEEEEEEE
Ryan your almost their 4.95 subscribes
Omg I would love to be in that room my kids never shut up peace and quiet just to sleep that sounds better then any pork chops

I wouldn't last in the quiet room! I hear the inside of my ears and internal body noises continually thanks to my autism.
1:17 - GO HUSKERS ! ! !   🏈   🏈   🏈
Wow so cool and dramatic
That's why prisoners that enter solitary confinement go completely mad because we're not meant to be alone that's why when I'm alone I have to always have the TV on or the radio I have to hear another voice
I liked Steve from his very first words
We got 18yo kids fighting in the military and then we got this dude. "Oh I survived the quietest room". wTF? 🤷🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
A heaven for introvert
I survived the world's quietest life ! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"wow cool And DRAMATIC"
Wow cool AND dramatic!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Introverts be like :- Are we joke to this World?
I’d be screwed, I can hear myself long blink.
Learn to shut up would be great. But for millennials tough right???
Damn..I wish I get that room..I can literally live there for as long as I want...Such a peace😌😌
I would want to try this, seems better than puzzle or escape rooms.
Hello

The Two Steps From Hell music makes it so dramatic lmfao
Who’s here from tik tok?
Wow cool and dramatic

“wow cool AND dramatic!!” :(
wow cool AND dramatic
WOW THIS WAS SO COOL AND DRAMATIC JUST LIKE A DOCUMENTARY I LOVE IT🤪🤪💗
I would just sleep really 🤷🏻‍♀️
you live a very cushy life if 45 minutes of absolute silence bothers you. it amazes me how soft people are now. I work at a place where I sit with 1 other human and more often than not we sit in absolute silence for that entire time and the only thing we have to keep us company is our own thoughts.
Dam. It'll turn you insane after 5 Year's.
I sit on the ground in an extremely quiet room while doing my meditation for 6hrs. For anyone who spend hours and hours maybe for an entire day, this wouldn't be a problem.
I want to do mindfulness in a place like that. It's maybe a way to don't exist at all
if your ears pop yawn, that works for me
We're surviving silence now... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Its peaceful
3:32 😂 🤣🤣😂😂
wow cool AND dramatic
Just sleep👻👻👻
I wonder how he felt after coming out of the room. I guess his ears would feel super sensitive to tinest sound....
“Wow cool and dramatic “
Wow cool AND dramatic
If you practice meditation it's a cake walk. I would love to spend time in that room
This place is great to sleep , I will atleast

Meanwhile me wheezing with my joints popping and my stomach churning and tinnitus ringing without a fancy -8db room.
I could create numerous art works in that room
weird i always lay on my left side when I sleep good to know.
That was not cool or dramatic
Um so like half a second after your *coffee noises* my stomach was making some weird noises too so....does that mean our stomachs were/are trying to communicate?????
What a bullshit this is so easy to be for many hours... You just sit and meditate what's the big deal... I've done a 4 days vision quest with no food water or movement from where I was and Hundreds of thousands of  people if not millions have done that throughout history
wow so COOL and DRAMATIC
👏👏👏
There is no way i could be in either room for more than 41 minutes without having a w8nk
I've measured SPL at several concerts. EDM shows have this reputation of being loud, but I usually see around 92db avg with peaks of MAYBE 100db near the speakers.
It's like horror eyes
I'd last a month no problem.  Deaf people do it their whole life.  (Ahh in the end he says the record is a myth and you can stay in there forever no problem)
3:49 I'm scared,, others everything fine 👍
I would love to live in the room
Wow cool and dramatic
Imagine what it would be like meditating in that room. Like 100% effective
Send me in
Tinnitus nightmare.
Are you serious….. try Solitary confinement for days

Instead of a “quiet place” how about a movie called a “quiet room” and it’s two hours and 45 minutes of nothing but silence?
It’s the dr Phil part that got me to subscribe 😂

A monk or a sage could survive even more, agree?
i hear my heart beat every night i go to bed and its fucking annoying. i cant sleep cuz of it until i just pass out of exhaustion
Leave some books and food here. I could spend half a day reading and eating and sleeping. That would be an ideal off day.
That was so cool and dramatic!!!
Cool n dramatic
I literally cried watching him walk towards that pork chop at thee end
Wow!cool and dramatic!
i would just fall asleep in that room if i could
I'd go to sleep. probably break the record
This is all B.S.
Being left alone in this room with only the voices in my head to keep me company, I’d probably go mad in about 15 minutes.
Bring a deaf human to that room and he is gonna stay there if he get enough food and water
I don’t know about the sound but I would die of the boredom
I am pretty sure I can break this record
I would love to sleep in this almost 8 hours a day, every day, until I expire. My body refuses to sleep when there’s any kind of noise. I JUST got use to white nose recently.
It's like the silence movie 😵😵
Awesummmm
And I am sleeping 😂😂😂😴😴
Best place to do asmr. No need for microphone xD
wow cool AND dramatic
didnt veritasium spend an almost 90 minutes in a room like this?
Wow cool AND dramatic 😳

I can broke this world record 🙂
as an introvert that hate noises, I wanna experience being in that room
It can't just be that you are in the quietest room. It has to be the fact that it is dark and no-one else is there.
I wouldn't survive even 5 minutes in here. Like I'm extroverted as hell and I always talk a lot unless I'm reading. If I was allowed to bring a book with me then I'd prolly just sit there for hours without realizing it.
this guys personality and content is why he gets so many views
When I leave my phone::::my situation look alike
Sense of time: de-elevated
You should've rubbed one out in there...
I have fired a lot of guns without hearing protection,  my ears ring all the time haha. I think I could actually get a good nap in that room..
I could not even stay in their for even 1 min lol
Wow COOL AND DRAMATIC
Easy .... especially when you have Pulsatile Tinnitus and Tinnitus, as no room is quiet.
The pictures where so cooool
I'd just sleep there for 12 hr ND make world record .
I CAN SPEND 1 DAY  I AM BEST IN SLEEPING  I WILL JUST SLEEP 😂😂

I would have been singing even though I say I have a bad voice. After all.. I’m not gonna be doing anything.
I have autism soooo... this would work really well for me, since my hearing is on overload all the time, every day. Ide be a ginne pig. Hit me up, ill try it.

Soooo cool
wow cool AND dramatic!!
*Wow cool and dramatic!*
LOL
I've been in an acoustic room like that while in training for my acoustic technician certification long time ago.  You stand on a net, and under it there is more sound absorbing foam. So, no echo comes from the floor, and your brain registers that there is no floor. The sensation is like being on top of a building with no wind. I wasn't in the dark, but I felt my body very loud indeed. The most annoying thing is the incredible loud buzz in your ear. The engineer working there told me that this buzz would go away if I kept going regularly to the room. The worst part is that I never really stopped hearing that buzz. Since that date, it comes back sometimes when I am in a quiet place.
that WAS cool and dramatic
So cool and dramatic
Bring a blanket, a pillow, a favorite book, and a lamp (or just leave the lights on). Pop in some ear plugs (or don't), then read *aloud,* in a normal voice, and the hour will be up before you know it. Boredom or hunger is what will prompt you to end the "torture." Easy peasy.
Imagine being deaf....
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (John 3:16)  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17):
This one was coool
Us all watching your pain in 8 mins
Wow, what a hero that survived such a thing, or person.
I will sleep for 1 hours quietly.....
Wow cool and dramatic
THAT DEMODOG!!!
WOW soo cool and dramatic😮

the reflection of his pupils moving around looks like ghost eyes
WoW cOoL AnD dRaMaTiC!
they should try to play music in the loudest room
The dad at the end looked embarrassed and also having that look that be like: “I told him so….. 😏”
ive done a room like this before. not the quietest one ever but very quiet and i could hear my own blood flowing. it became deafening
Cool
Wow! Cool and dramatic
I think i would leave for food/water not because it was quiet.
I'd more than likely just.... fall asleep
Give me an ipad/laptop with minecraft on it, And i’ll survive 10 hours there
Glad to see another enlightened brother 👍
ok its cool and dramatic🤣🤣
It's kinda creepy
Bc there’s nothing around me to experience… I have the perspective that I am the experience 🤯
I wonder what it would be like in that room with tinnitus. Sometimes I sit in the car with silence and i just hear loud ringing.
Wow cool AND dramatic! :)
what if you fart in that room ?
because you told me too,  wow this was cool AND dramatic!1!!!1
WOW COOL AND DRAMATIC
This was cool AND dramatic!!!

Best place to do meditation.
One room totally dark and silent. It is very peaceful...Yeah,yeah...
I would love to stay in this room for 4 hours straight. This would be peaceful and enhances your senses mostly 6th sense.
I do not want to be alone with my own thoughts, so I would probably not last 10 minutes.
A perfect place to meditate.
That room is perfect for my Online classes 😁😂
Worlds loudest place : A concert  My teacher's yell : Pathetic.

dB's what`? You need a reference you mean dBm or what? Saying dB it just like saying %... This room is 5%... makes no sense. So please stop using dB as a unit when you don't reference it to something like dBA or dBm.

The world's quietest room me: isnt this whats being deaf?
Dude! Do you EVER shut up??????? I'd give anything to be able to experience pure silence...
wow cool AND dramatic!
I have horrible noise sensitivity that requires me to wear earplugs and noise-canceling headphones almost 24/7, but sometimes I get so bothered by the sound of my own heartbeat that I opt to uncover my ears. I guess it's like a ticking clock that can remind you of your own mortality, and it doesn't help I've got a heart condition.
U r right does camera shots were dramatic 🤣
super cool and epik
Wow almost a whole hr, really tuff
Wait listen to me if he started hearing bodily stuff what about deaf people do they hear that in complete darkness

Oh yes get me in there, hell you'd have to drag me out!! I'd live in there (and that's saying something as I'm a lifetime heavy metal fan) The sheer thought of not having to listen to other people's crap makes that room hugely appealing

Easiest way to pass time in that room is by sleeping 😴 😴.  Good night 😁😁
Wow cool and dramatic:")
My chest feels tighter than a 🐫 camel's butt in the middle of a sand storm. -Ryan 2021  THE MOST ICONIC LINE EVER!
Sounds like a good nap place to me
I'd sleep for hours in that quiet room
Why the fuck would this be hard ? I live on an isolated farm and the animals are far away from the house. Silence is normal. Its good. I hate noise.
The most cool and dramatic video ive evern seen
Loves, no one can give you better protection than JESUS. HE is here to help you and love you. HE wants you to turn to HIM so that you can know HIS love and HE can show you how to overcome your suffering. Please accept, HE loves you. I bless you all in the name of JESUS

wow this was cool AND dramatic
this was cool and dramatic. BANANA
how abt deaf ppl?
Haha
You clearly have no understanding of how decibels work  as for the front row of a kiss concert and immediate and permanent hearing loss  MATE,   I've been to lots of kiss concerts.....    YES.. FRONT ROW. Metallica....Same... Front row i can hear very well to this day  Like most people that do these sorts of videos YOU LACK A FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW A DECIBEL WORKS  You can't say ...........ROCK CONCERT = 150 dB          Cafeteria 100dB. on it's own it means nothing  like i said... YOU CLEARLY HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING HOW DECIBELS WORK  You think if a noise is at "X level" then it's    "this many decibels" that's not correct  FACT IS... You have a noise at one level  and yet it can be at 10 different decibel levels it can be at 100 different decibel levels  DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR POINT OF REFERENCE IS   You should learn how decibels works
*Everyone talking about the fact he stated there for almost an hour*          Me: *Laughing at the end*
I want to try that I can't lie. It kinda remind me of an experiment in an episode of UFO.
WOW cool and DRAMATIC

OMG WHEN IT SAID COFFEE NOISES THE COFFEE MACHINE RANDOMLY TURNED ON!
I once spent about a half hour alone in the quiet room at Roke, (3rd quietest in the UK?) and absolutely loved it.  Didn’t want to leave.  No weirdnesses, just hearing heartbeats and lying on the floor even those quietened down.  Best relaxation exercise ever.
DUDE THIS VIDEO WAS SO COOL AND DRAMATIC 🤌
I wish I had this room.... Because if you do this regularly..... You have no idea how much your normal senses and abilities increase... Its like you'll be able to almost hear the sound of any thing coming very fast towards you... Like KILL BILL'S White Japanese Lady(dont remember her name) And it automatically increases your reflexes drastically... Its a human behaviour
I can also beat the world record for being in the quietest room for the longest time easily
Was he suppose to sit and not talk or just be in the room alone?
deaf ppl: what are these ppl complaining about
wow cool AND dramatic
Bruhh this is not the quitest room but the laibary is lol
wow thats cool and dramatic
This is so awesome. I would love this room. I do vipassana meditation so this room would be perfect for meditation. Would feel fresh after. Vipassana is to accept how it is in the moment, without feeling anything. Just be there. My mediation would be great in a room like this.

I didn't know you could actually go inside this room. A goal in my life now is to go there and break that record, while not saying a single word.
this was so dramatic tho
Does anyone notice hes lost 6.Millioon subscribers
ez just sleep
I could break that record easily
“Totally cool and dramatic”         Me really: this was *ACKWARD*.   (Probably bad grammar but I don’t care)
If you leave the light on for me and allow me to read my Bible sign me for 8 hours! cf. Col. 1:13-14, John 17:17, 2 Tim. 2:15, 2 Tim. 3:15-17. Psalm 119:103, Psalm 119:105.

Fun fact : High introverts can survive in this room 😁😅

I think i'd just go to sleep
I subscribed so you could talk to dr. phil. Love you bro
This was cool and dramatic
Teachers would love this    Who agrees?
Pearants:all i want is peace and quiet Me:are u sure about that
This would honestly have been more interesting if you saved the talking until afterwards, and just experienced actual silence...
So do you have a certificate for braking the world record?
The world quitest room is a gravestone
Me : go into the room ... Fell asleep due to silence , wakes up braking a record.. yeeee
wow cool AND dramatic

By the way whoever designed it said room is for to peacefully sit but English is scarce in language. Peace in sanskrit means shanti but You moved frm shanti to susksma. Like frm good to better. It goes upto Shiva. 🙏

THIS IS THE COOLEST AND MOST DRAMATIC VIDEO I HAVE SEEN ON YOUTUBE
I just want to challenge this to 24 hours if  this place is near my country
Are they getting “louder” or are we becoming more aware hmm
MINISOTA
WOW NOWAY, I THINK I CANT EVEN MAKJE IT FOR 1 MINUTE BECAUSE I LIVE IN INDONESIA AND ITS SO LOUD HERE>>EVEN IN MY HOUSE BECAUSE MYMOM WASH CLEANING AND BLABLABLABLA
The longer you spend in such a place the more unsettling it is to leave it.

I would love to be there. Can meditate, study, write thesis, make arts. I wish I was there for some time.
Imagine doing asmr in the quiet pest room
Wow cool and dramatic

Woah Ryan this was cool AND dramatic
I can make it 8-9 hours. I'd just sleep there & It'll be the best nap of my life.
wow cool AND dramatic!!1!
if i were in that room, i would've simply went to sleep.
dUDE, LITERALMENTE COMES ALGO SIN GUSTO xD
I think this goes to show how many people lack peace within themselves & the lack of control people have over our minds and thoughts to really not be able to sit in a quiet room with just your presence and just be at peace. 👀
Send a pro meditator or yogi there.....you will laugh on current world record
The eyes are killing me 😂😂
That was very entertaining for some reason
i would sleep
The quietest room is the loudest room for someone with tinnitis
I can kill that record. I can talk to God for hours.
I would go insane in 10 min
I would love to go there with my 20 books  :)
Imagine the naps in that place
This was literally so cool and dramatic
Practice yoga then try again
wow cool AND dramatic!!
you can go deaf from too much quietness because the ringing in ur ears causes your ears to collapse (jk it’s just to scare you)
This sounds like the perfect room for me.  Maybe I’d be able to sleep through the night.  literally my dream room.  I’d smash that record.  They have to make me leave.
wow cool AND dramaiic!!":(
wow cool AND dramatic!!
My God, I can't believe how cool and dramatic this is!
*"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago and the next best time is now"* I consider this to be best motivational quote I've heard in a very long time. But motivational quotes are useless if you don't practice what you preach*
World record of 41 minutes? That sounds pathetic.
Wow cool and dramatic

I would easily ✨fall asleep✨
I would have countless things to think about. I'm good at daydreaming
Imagine if these weak minded people actually got tinnitus and heard a high pitch noise blaring in their ears for the rest of their lives?  A quiet room? no such thing.

Can’t people survive this by just singing songs for 45 minutes?
I luv that room..
Hey kid watch sadghuro..
LETS GO BRANDON

Huhh I survived it after my each result for past 10 years
OMG I freaking cracked up when you were by the bus like WTF
Me at this room: singing random songs since I couldn't when I lived in a non soundproof condominium
I would just sleep there 😂 until I wake up..
Here I am , who can easily listen to own ear buzzing and heartbeats every night. I didn't know my house was so silent.
Oh man 😮😮
Now I kinda want to try this out
Fact:- World's quietest room isn't actually quite , because there you will hear the sound which you usually don't hear 💀💀
World's quietest room, with a constant shit talker sitting in it.
Am i allowed to lay down there? Not sleeping just laying down with open eyes? If yes, I'm in 😁
Introvert heaven/ Extroverts hell be like:
Wow this is cool
I want to break this record......

I sometimes wonder How the hell Hellen Keller survived her whole life 😱

I could stay longer because I sleep like a bear 😏
Now I know why I enjoy laying on the left side more than anything 😂
Why so much fuss about such shitty dares? What is tough in these time wasting dares? If anyone has big prize money to offer, I am open to do these little dares.

People with hearing conditions:  "Now you understand how we feel 😀👍"

Wow so cool and dramatic when you were in the quiet room
Deaf people: 😏
WOW AND COOL AND DRAMATIC
Seen quite a few vdoz like this...just curious if you're allowed to sleep😗✌🏻
Idk what world record he's talking about, Veritasium did a video about this 7 years ago and he stayed in there for a hour too.  Basically, this 41 minutes world record thing sounds pretty lame.
cool and dramatic
I like how he used the music you get when you search dramatic music on YT… may or may not be one of my fav songs.
The thumbnail is cringy af but the video is cool
Me as an introvert: that's a dream!

Our body starts adapting itself according to the condition.We just have to meditate and so that the seven minds with our body also adapt to the condition.
how does have an eyeball inside and eyeball?
I could sleep there for hours and break the record.
This was cool and dramatic !

CAN YOU PLEASE :- PIN MY COMMENT ❣️
Dude why don't sing? LALALALALA
My tinnitus would say no 🥰
My tinnitus would say no 🥰
wow cool AND dramatic!!
That room would be torture for someone with tinnitus.  Being someone who has it, there has to be some sort of ambient noise at all times or you will go insane from the humming in your head.
nice, now white torture next 🙂
Would you rather to live in the loudest room Or live in a quiet room
150 dB for a rock concert is bullshit. I work as sound engineer and any scientist can confirm that you can't stand at 150 dB for long time (160 dB is a plane at take off). Rock concert is about 105 110 dB. Don't forget that decibel is defined by logarithm in base 10.
WOW COOL AND DRAMATIC
I had a tinnitus and this probably gonna kill me
me: **lays on ground and passes out**
I like the eyes they looked cool in the dark
over dramatic and pathetic
Good for meditation

If that inventor sell his invention to East Asian countries or any Buddhist Temples, he would get STONK in no time

I feel like that is what space would be like
Wowww
it was cool and dramatic :)
WOW COOL AND DRAMATIC
I want to do this!
Did this have any rules? If not then I would still stay in there for probably 5 min 😭
After closing in on an hour and getting within spitting distance of the World Record, Callux almost gave in as he repored becoming disturbed by hallucinations in the room, but not only did he perseveres, but he went on to smash the previous record, setting a new one of one hour and 26 minutes. Sorry Ryan
deaf man disguises and gets the record
That sounds like introvert's heaven and i love to go there
I think a deaf guy is worthy to hold the record.
I say that’s just torture, i hope your okay.
Why can't you just sleep..??

Driving a person crazy just because of a quiet room, is actually true, its possible because person's mind has endless thoughts and what makes the room evern creepier to drive someone crazy is because its dark..

WOW COOL AND DRAMATIC
It would be great if I can enjoy this too since I prefer silence
I have a rare hearing disorder that lets me hear really well. My life has never been quiet, so I’ve always thought about what would happen if I was in a room like that.

But why turn off the lights? To make you scared, anxious? I would repeat the test with lights on. It probably also depends what kind of person you are. I love silence and quiet noises like digestion while sleeping and my room is under 19dB at night.
Of for feck sake.. I have to do it by myself, for good now.. - Finee... I'll do it by myself...!😑
wow cool n dramatic

If I want to be in the World's Quietest Room, I turn off my PS4.
Now you know how I feel being that one person that has to ignore what other people say because either they're talking about how quiet I am or not- I can go on with doing a normal day today things but the thing is I can't go a second without thinking, "what do they think of me?"
Wow sooo cool and dramatic 😲
wow cool AND dramatic!!
I’d sleep for 48 hours lol

take a nap
Cool and dramatic
I just have a quick question. The youtuber Callux set the world record for the longest time in the quietest room in the world (1hr 26mins) but that was in London. Is it the same model because Ryan said he wanted to break the same record, technically he wouldn't have broken the record because he only tried to beat 45mins. Maybe the Callux one wasn't the quietest in the world or maybe he is just trying to beat the record on this silent room. Anyways GOOD CONTENT
i thought that was interesting lol
Quiet room? More like escape room
*imagine falling asleep in there and waking up to find out that you broke the world record*
you are cool and drimatic
this is so fun watching him stay in a quiet room
This experiment is showing us how very weak we are, that we are not able to stay lonely with our own brain face to face. It's nothing to do with quietness. It's something to do with how our brains works weirdly and probably not normally. If you think about it deeply - why actually it is so difficult to stay there? There's absolutely nothing what can irritate us. Nothing ! So, we irritate ourself. We can't stand our own brain and how it works. We can't control it. That's why it is so difficult to be there, while normally we have tons of distractions every day and we don't want to think about it.
I would still pretend that I’m an actress and winning Oscar’s and giving myself interviews
Your ego made you go mad in that room. You take any experienced meditator and they will love it.
Too easy
Wow cool and dramatic

The Naval Surface Warfare Center in Crane Indiana has a similar sound room where it can research sensors. I always thought that was the quietest room.... maybe folks just don't know about the lab.

poor chad, can't survive 10 minutes without being talked to. meanwhile 80% of men are sitting alone in their own empty apartments for years.
Wow cool and dramatic

Can you explain what happens  if you make some noises?
Monks have been doing it forever get over it tiny baby
Me thinking ....... . . That's the best room to sleep...👉😭👈
Ummm anyone who does float tanks will EASILY float for an hour in total silence, and total darkness.  So quiet you can literally hear your eyes moving in your head.  41 minutes in this room just means he got out 19 minutes too early
Give this place to a Monk.. He definitely love this
So dramatic!
wow cool AND dramatic!😮😮😮
Best place for sleeping
Cool and dramatic, Ryan

…So how is isolation for psych patients and prisoners okay? If it drives a “sane” person crazy? What does it do to someone who has proven they aren’t mentally okay? JW
It would be like if you were in a place where heaven and your greatest dreams combined and you had inner peace
Imagine somebody makes the super super quietest room you can only hear everything even what’s going inside your body
wow COOL and dramatic!!

That's heaven for introverts!
This was so cool and dramatic
i like going into silent places and im a quiet person too, but this would break my head because of how much thoughts goes through my head even though im just silent
Just sleep

Can you sleep inside? Is it allowed?
The way you tell the story and had a plan for this is wonderful. Great YouTuber
wow cool AND dramatic
I would love my bedroom to be this quiet. I can't stand any noises when sleeping. I can hear the neighbours talking, cats and dogs a few streets away, cars a distant away, etc. I once wanted to seal my window and nail additional sound block materials all over the walls. It was just too much trouble so I resorted to silicone ear plugs.
this is literally the coolest and most dramatic video i've seen in my life. i've been roaming around this world for longer than i wanted and expected and i have never seen something as amazing as this video. life changing! 10000/10 i recommend.
Who would've known Minnesota had the quietest room?
wow cool AND dramatic!!

Why your other senses are elevated is because the power of your hearing is useless your body uses that power to help all of your other senses i think that’s really cool!

Spent some time on an abandoned military base. Went to the armory and entered a walk in gun safe. Closed the door. I could hear my blood circulating. My heartbeat. And the farts that I would rip. Jesus. Like a nuclear explosion. Amazing. I've always wanted to recreate the feeling.

You can spend as much time in there as you want. Turn the lights on and you can spend even longer. Lame...
To be honest, I think it wouldn't be the noises that drive me crazy, it'd be the thought that somewhere in the dark, there was a monster, just watching me
wow cool AND dramatic :(
I could live in that room
Where'd you get that white t-shirt? I need a costume, and the best costume, is the one they least expect
WOW COOL AND DRAMATIC!

WOW COOL AND DRAMATIC OMG
When I lived in the dessert we had a generator on all day because we didn't live in a house we lived in a trailer, and when it was time for bed and we turned off the generator, it was silence. Pure silence. It was so quiet that it was loud, I could hear my heart beat as if someone banged two pots together, I could also hear my blood flow to my head and I would always hear this...hum. It wasn't quite either, it was almost like my lullaby. There were different types of hums here and there though. Sometimes it would be really loud, really high-pitch, really low-pitch, sometimes it was so low that it made me want to scream. Just to be able to hear a different sound. The sounds gave me nightmares. I once had a nightmare where my mom died at a gas station because she left her car on while putting gas in it. I was 7 and I didn't know that could happen, but I dreamt of it. The thing that freaked me out the most is that I knew it was my mom....my mom went to jail when I was barely four. I don't even remember what she looks like. But then we moved from California to Missouri(wish we didn't)and we don't use a generator anymore. We have normal electricity so now its no longer loud at day. It's not really quite at night, there's a lot of wind so I don't hear the hums anymore..I almost miss them...
wow that’s o cool and dramatic!!
I like it when a big room is empty and quiet for some reason
I would just fall asleep, that would be very easy.
I can beat that if I'm allowed to sleep
I need dis dam room🥺
Where is this place located I need it

Wow cool AND dramatic
i would just hear *eeeeeeeeee* thanks tinnitus 😧🙏
wow cool AND dramatic!!
Apparently, Ryan has a lot of free time to waste.
At age 14, I visited the Gran Sabana in Venezuela. We stopped in the middle of nowhere, 100s of Kms from other humans. After the jeeps motor cools down and stops making noises; Then you can really hear de silence and hear your own heartbeat. It is a great experience. For the last 16 years, I live with Chronic Cerebral tinnitus. I constantly hear, inside my head, all kinds of weird noises. I wonder what would happen, if I went now into a quiet room?
wow COOL and DRAMATIC!!!
On the top of Haleakala in Hawaii there is complete silence (if there is no one else around).  No wind sound, no insects, no vehicles, no birds, no aircraft, just nothing.
wow cool AND dramatic
I would’ve died if were there…

Since people are allowed to make noise in the quiet room that's not so hard of a challenge To me Cuz I Deal with that mostly every single day

Isnt it like 1 hour and half? Not 41 mins
It's a good thing that you Don't have to remain silent in the quiet room Cuz if that was the case then a lots of people would fail the challenge making it that much harder
It was cool, and dramatic. Don't worry.

Only one hour? Pfff... dude, I'd live in that room. Heck, I think I'd like it so much I'd decorate my bedroom like that.     (If some really rich person put there feels like they have way too much money and wants to burn some of it on something exceptionally pointless, but positive karma inducing, hit me up. Buy me a plane ticket! :D I'd smash that so called "record" so hard it's not even funny.)

Introverts be like : 41 minutes easy !! Dude i can spend my whole life in that pretty room of yours just give a pile of books and a computer
I could easily beat that record if sleeping was allowed :)
I m the experience ❤️ That's the highest level of spirituality and amazing thing is that you have achieved that in just 1 hour. Wow 😍❤️
Because there is nothing around me to experience  I am the experience 🤯                                              - Ryan
As introvert I would like to spend the rest of my life that room

In a small little town there lived a hero who was considered to be the most powerful and wise person by everyone in that town. But one fine day the hero is challenged by a worthy opponent from another town (the pork chop). After a fight the hero is defeated and the pork chop takes his place as the the most powerful and wise person of that town. The hero then embarks on a journey to learn more and find a solution to finally defeat the pork chop. He finds a sensei who agrees to give him the key to defeating the pork chop only if he is successful in beating a world record (sitting in the room).The hero goes into the room and about 10 minutes later the hero feels like giving up. But he then experiences a flashback of how the pork chop ridicules him and tells him that he is good at nothing. Wanting to prove the pork chop wrong  the hero is determined to continue the challenge. Soon the hero is victorious and finds out that the sensei actually tricked him into thinking that there was a world record for him to beat. Sensei told him this was the only way to teach the hero how to defeat the pork chop. He goes back to his town where he finds the pork chop waiting for him on the throne at 2 am. In a final epic battle the hero uses the experience and power he gained from the quiet room to completely wipe the pork chop from existence. The hero finally defeats the pork chop and claims victory.
This is like being deaf but 100x worst
