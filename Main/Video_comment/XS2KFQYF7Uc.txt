Does anyone else eat  a bomb pop while watching this?
Why plaster and not silicone? It would be more food safe. Is it the weight?

Sloane was MAD when Jamie said “WaS tHaT lAdY gAgA?”
What to do when your bored😂
Make a giant Twix or any candy pls pls pls pls
YUMMY
You guys should do it with the actual rocket pops. Cut the gummy instead
Tip: Plaster of Paris is ment to be complete liquid before it's pored so it should be liquid when it goes in
You don't ship to the new United you don't ship to Canada and I am really upset about it
YOU MADE THIS ON MY BIRTH DAY  CAN I HAVE A PIN PLEASEEEEEE
We should congratulate Jamie for building the box for views.
“Pancake batter” omg ok And I I’m craving a rocket pop now
usa 🇺🇸
How do they all not have diabetes yet

They work so hard
Pls tell me you cleaned out all the small pieces of foam that were left in the molds so no one gets sick or worse poison

This is the end of world's largest now it's time for the world's mediumests stuff
I've been watching this for years. I found Vat19 from those kids flexing the gummy worms and then one kid comes with the long one.
America???
Since Jamie                                            SCREWED UP. No.

Was that even edible lol
WARNING! Read on, otherwise your soul will be taken, even if you read the word "warning"! Once upon a time there was a man named Duke Hunapon. He was lazy and very indifferent. He always wore a jacket, no matter how warm it was outside. He had an older brother named Michael who always ruled him. One day, Michael was killed, which greatly influenced Duke. He went mad and started murdering people. Soon he got into a fight with someone and was killed. Now he wanders around as a tall skeleton in a red shirt and the same hoodie Duke wore. This skeleton was known as the "Swapfell Papyrus" and will kill you if you don't post it in the 15 comment sections of any website before bedtime. If you fail and wake up with him in your room, your death will be slow and very painful. A girl named Lily Lilupan read it, and he wasn't listening. She was (EEE) and killed in her sleep. If you copy and paste this into 15 comment sections on any website before bedtime, Swapfell Papyrus will make sure you feel safe
LOL😂
How many calories is it though
Sloan tell Jamie that you’re better than him you’re my favorite
Need to pick up something heavy? Kyle
I have too
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,it’s Jamie!!
Jamie, I feel Sloane deserves a hidden in plain depot. If I’m being honest you blame a lot of things on her. She deserves what she deserves. Poor Sloane finally deserves her big break.  *this is just for fun do not take this seriously brought to you by fruit roll down company. Please add any warranty needed* also HIDDEN IN PLAIN DEPOT!
Sloane: Jamie: I- no. wait. this comment is so reused. this isnt ur typical stolen comment. it is not!
I am a kid
Worlds biggest gummy wolf
SAAMMEE BRO
Hi
cool
SLOANE AND JAMIE ARE ADORABLE TOGETHER  also Sloane's songs are a mood.
Cause baby you’re a firework
Jamie don’t say that this is a PG channel
Sloane should release the sobg!!
Matter a fact plaster does make you cuss,  In a couple ways in fact  1. You smash your hand or toe on a heavy piece of dry plaster 2. You make a mold for a latex mask and the mold doesn't end up right
Same
Look how much dedication this took
@hanis experiment I do to but to many reply’s I had to make this comment
just 194 more countries to celebrate with giant gummies!
Murica
7:09 I was laughing my heart out
Ÿ
I really want to know to process on how they deal with Their gummy creation after. Do they just toss it or more logically share it and take some gummy home. I want to see them make a video about it
? i thought the white was supposed to be the biggest part
Jamie: *spills* oh %!*&
Me to
Jamie's a bad boss
I love how Jamie just is like I hate working with plaster and the just gets it done nice job👍🏻
You were one gummy bear short on the blue

The only reason Kyle is there is because they need help lifting it 😂
The screaming goat is so awesome so I just added it to my birthday list

Hi

Yo new music artist

Bro i would pay to work for jamie. It just looks so fun and exiting.
3:54 y’all never used plaster in art class
Do you know how many gummy bears they killed to make that
That Bomb Pop locks  like the Romanian flag
I am still am a kid
Use colace
hold on a second,  it said 85000 gummy  bears and Sloane ate 1 so that would be 84999 gummy  bears so they lied to us

Doing math over the summer, couldn't be me.
please believe in God,Jesus died for your sins so that you can go to heaven,Christianity is a religion if anyone needs a religion,God and Jesus can help you . . . .
Jamie sounds like a villan

I love your videos your so cool wish you were a TV show!!
i miss the old videos
There is one scene of this video were Jamie is wearing a Girls On The Run 5k shirt. And the Girls on The Run Shirt changes ever year. Yet, I have the shirt that Jamie was wearing meaning that There was a time were I ran the same 5k as him and possibly saw him yet didn't know who he was at the time.

Sloane is a wannabe Danny
Hidden in plain depot
frick
What if y’all froze the gummy rocket pop so it was like a real popsicle🤔🧐🤨
Is
This is so unsanitary
I mean.. i don’t want to be that guy who just says bad stuff abt. Vat19, but this isnt the var19 i remember from my childhood. It’s kindof too family friendly in a weird way?. This isnt vat19 with jamie as the boss. This is Pat18 with jacob as the boss
Just not the same without Jon, Joey and Danny :((
I been watching this when I was 4
thats masive
Eat it and eat and then eat
I've work with plaster of paris before. And when you dont know how to do it then its hella annoying. I'm pretty worried when they make the first batch of plaster that thick, it need much water until it met crepe batter consistency so it doesnt harden so easily. But the good thing is that the longer it need to dry, the harder the plaster will be.
3:19 is very good
Make a candy corn for Halloween
@Vat19 you guys are such a wholesome page! You guys calm my anxiety everytime and my depression!! You guys are awesome!! I really want to meet you guys and be in a video with you guys!!
Slone would be everyone’s best friend ngl
Hidden in plain depot needs to happen
the end result bounced the same height.
I watch it when I was six years old
Hmmmm... Yall can make bigger. İ bet yall can make smaller to- DO İT PLZ-
It was 2mounts to 3mounts
you guys are so smart to be able to do this!! i know this took a lot of time and effort to do this and i am glad you succeeded
This was made on my brothers birthday

Sloane : pulls out the gorilla glue  Me : not the gorilla glue
Jamie: Sloan is the worst Also Jamie: You’re doing great! *shoves gummy down throat*
you only needed 2 molds just use the bottom  mold for the middle too
Ummm… I’m not sure Plaster is food safe… I know its a lot but food grade silicone is the way to go
I can literally smell the home depot
Sloan gives off the vibes of a kid an employee brought to work during the Bring Your Kid to Work Day, and they just decided to keep her.
Sloan should be a doing writer
i love it
I like gummy bear ice cream American since I was 5 then I'm 8 years old

Hey I was wondering about the metal slime but can you make like ammo for a slingshot with it
jamie: is that like lady gaga or something                                                                                                                                         me: maybe you're just jealous cuz she can sing better then you

"Sloane Just Blasting Off On A Bomb Pop As Katie Perry😂"
They should give the person who checked all your items out a raise
Me: playing roblox at 3 in the morning     Sloane: ……
No one talks about how jamie is lazy while sloane was carving the foam
the ultimate cause of diabetes
the gummy bear thing was satisfying
would have been more food safe if you made silicone moulds out of the plaster of paris
All i hear the entire video  Jamie:SLOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNEEEEEEE
How do you apply to work here? Because when I’m of age I wanna join your crew
Just wondering but we’re did Joey go
Sorry but can i buy your stuff and it will come to Poland or not that country i mean do you deliver too Poland??

Hey Vat19, I just wanted to say that you guys are awesome and eric and sloane are the funniest. But sloane is my favorite. Enjoy and make some more vids, maybe real or gummy, real or jellybean, or even eat it or wear it.

I'm still a kid
I can't be the only one that cringed when they ate it after every hand has been on it. Right?
How many gummy rocket pops do you think Jamie ate in this video alone?? 🤣🤣
At the scene they lifted it up and the music played I visualized scenes where they load up the missile that’s gonna save the day, imagine weaponizing gummy’s like this
Sloane seems like she's on the verge of breaking under Jamie's cruel boss rule
jeez cringe

My favorite person is slonye
Ok i think yall ment celebrateing the day we stole this country from innocent people who got kicked out of evry contry that they owned
This is like the 10th time I’m watching this video
Wright joke on pop stick
does anyone wonder where joey went?
GIANT GUMMY BREAKFAST PLEASSSSSSSSE
I feel really grossed out cuz i thought the candy might taste, smell like plaster.  Since gummy is sticky... plus probable residue from the plaster.
You kinda made the flag of romania
Happy Birthday USA
If this was in the vat19 store how much do you think it would be to buy.
When  he cust I died😂😂😂😂
You should never swear in public for a kid show
I’m not the only one who wants to take a big chunk out of it and eat it right?-
Why does Jamie have a girls on the run shirt cuz my school does that program to
That plastir looks like the paste that my dentist use in my mouth
Vat19 deserves WAY more subscribers!!! They put in so much effort into making these videos!!! :'3
Looks like the romanian flag
I wachted need to watch this but it  is 😎🆒️ my mom said I must 🥲
USA USA USA!!!!!
What happened to Joey and his friend

My fav vid I love bomb pops I have so many in my freezer

Anyway Jamie looks like he’d be a republican so that’s a yikes for me
Yikes y’all celebrating the 4th? In this economy? 🤢
Is Jamie the boss of vat 19?
Honestly the best channel ever
The popsicle looks more French than american. Oops.
Where is everyone else?? 🤣🤣🤔
It like a giant rocket usa sworld
Sloane gives me Danny vibes
Me
What do you do with all the rest of the candy
Jamie’s an old babajaga  (means old witch or lady) and the laziest  person in the world!
When jamie say’s = she’s the worst get back to work  Is rhymes
Let Matt stonie eat it now

Is that edible???
Sloan is the adult version on JoJo Siwa
Plot Twist: This was secretly just Hidden In Plain Depot #2, with extra steps.
Can u make a deliver me a giant gummy popsicle?
they should sell this monster!!! I know that at least someone would bye it (that someone being me lol)
Yesss
Who else REALLY wants to see hidden in plain depot
Wait a minute… this isn’t sponsored by plaster of Paris, is it? 🤔
I don’t think that is clean
It must be a blast to work here
Sloane when she sees anything: Hidden in plain Depot!                             My mind: i kinda wanna watch that...
I watch Vat19 every single day and I just stared watching this 2 days ago and I’m already obsessed and the first video I watched was a can you break it and then I would not stop watching this so thank you very much
47 seconds
Wow that’s a long one I did
Happy Fourth of July guys this is your birthday present every Fourth of July is your birthday so they will you’ll get like Santa does well see you in the car

Oh wait it’s a Unmeltable version
Giant rocket pop
Don’t worry it will come back in 2022
Fourth of July has ended sorry :(
8:03 you’re welcome guys

Do a series 2 of hidden in plain sight with her it would be POG
Where did John go?
This is how many gummy bears Sloan ate. | |
I watched Vat19 since I was smol boi. Man how I miss the good days
I think this might be a world record…
You guys work 1h and 30m away form me
Where are your guys company?
I love VAT19 they're just the right level of cringe and coolness to look epic 👌🏼
Hey can you make a copy of a actual gummy worm but a xtra larger sour version
Sloane: *BIG BRAIN TIME*
We were doing a school poster project and we got American Independence Day it went well
The troubled math generally deserve because appliance angiographically explode versus a kindly gymnast. willing, chunky warm
Is it weird I would like to see a massive giant gummy worm
And the fact that they get payed for this is amazing!!😮
Jammie is the boss and he’s stupid! Haha  Ok I’m not bullying you ok
if its not meltable just use a blowtorch and burn the whole gummy for the point proven
Them: it'll come out white once we finish with them!  Me: What are you gonna do with them? 😳
Why gorilla glue✋😭
Halal
Cool
Jamie she was singing Katy Perry
Mi infancia 😭
What happens to Kara?
it is copyrighted
How much do you get paid to work at vat19
I want jack black to voice over this
Now I wanna make that
My bc day is on the 9th happy birthday to me?
7:07 I like the song XD
Vat 19 is so different then how it was a year or 2 ago
Me too
Wear a mask
Am I the only one who thinks Sloane and Jamie should bring back hidden in plain sight
Bro I just got done eating a whole box of this like an hour ago
I think it should be washed because it’s dirty
l just can't stand sloan and she is in every video now, really close to unsubscribing.
You guys are So Cringe..     I Like it
For some reason that girl makes me irrationally mad
Shouldn’t Jamie know what he’s doing since he’s the boss of the place 😂😂
Next year they'll be done eating it
That moment when you waste 300lbs of gummy because you didn't use a food safe mold
Anyone else remember when Sloan was talking about hidden in plain night  And now she’s talking about hidden in plain depot more
I get so happy to see Kyle even if it’s just for a split second
7:07
Jaimee see shirt says Girls on the run
Love you
Vat-19 isnt the same it just dosnt flow the same anymore
Be back in 1 day next day:BEARD
Hey can you make a MASSIVE simple dimple
When they finished it I almost cried

Imagine making that the size of a real rocket, it can feed up to 100 people
I miss the old way how they showcase products, short and simple.
I just saw her eating the gummy bear just saw her like literally bruhhhh
I love you guys so much that looks more like Romania's flag🇷🇴. Love you guys
We win.
Me: *Checking the comments*  Also me: Why are there alot of stolen comments?

God bless all 😍😘🥰🥰😘😍
Hey brothers and sisters, I love y'all and it's just been in my heart today to share that Jesus love y'all so much and unconditionally. I don't know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let's leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. " Also in 2 corinthians 4:18" So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." Time is so short. And I always say this" I want all of us to be saved. " Jesus is coming back soon." with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let's take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn't easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I'm not trying to force anything on anybody or even force to do something they don't. Everyone has their own choice whether to read or ignore this message. But I'm sending this message to all out of love, because if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her because you love her and if you didn't, it show that you don't love her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don't want anyone I love, know/don't know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He knew us, He knitted us in our mother's womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it's beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don't understand it. So I want to tell you it's time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready friends, for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let's not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that's why He didn't think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back.   How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin.   Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ🙏  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior. Amen  Spreading the Gospel on every content on YouTube 🙏❤️,
3:05   who else remembers the twilight zo... area
กวนตีนแรงเนาะ
Sloane sounds like rclbeauty101
that is the the netherlands flag
Hey Jamie I don’t know what day but did you go to a snowcone place sometime soon
I am seriosly convinced that slone and jamie are dating, like if u agree
you guys should make a huge lil nitro
“Treat it like your kids bully”  they kick it
Now im scared if they loose interest in making these sure they have idea but one day they will have no more ideas to show use and that keeps me awake watching my favorite you tubers fall sure there are some who can make more things because there content is still going and some still need to make original ideas or maybe im just thinking way to deep and just watch them as i can
Noice
Pls make a red clear stresball
Thank you for the slushy maker Jamie
Can you make a giant slime
7:27  Its Katy Perry
The way it just kind of jiggles and bends when it was picked up 🤣 this is magnificent!
They never took a bite of it on camera. I'm betting it tassted like shit or nobody wanted to eat it (I saw then lay it down on that guys shoe/leg) or it was flavorless (they never promised it would be flavored and even if they did could we trust them?).
Is plaster of paris edible though?
Is no one going to talk about how James or Jamey cussed twise
How much does shipping for serbia cost? I wanna buy something from Vat19.
My hame is sloane
Did they even wash the mold there would be foam there
Americans: bwhaa bwhaa bwhaaa we won the War hahahaha    The rest of the World: ok i really dont Care tho
https://youtu.be/t3e1OH_Ww74Welcome to Gboard clipboard, any text you copy will be saved here.Tap on a clip to paste it in the text box.

For once Jamie was actively doing work on it, and did a good job! /j /lh
7:57 the thumbnail says 84000 gummy bears but Sloane ate one making it 83999 gummy bears.
you should make a mini version of burn or bliss
is anyone gonna tell me that the gummy bomb pop looks like the flag of France???
7:26 Jamie: "What was that like Lady Gaga?" Me: Um....Excuse me?
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah the end
Thats all gelatin 🐄
The mold for the gummy rocket pop looks like the Soyuz 1st stage which is a Soviet rocket
The Home Depot people when they see vat 19 people coming in, “oh great, these crackheads”
Y not use resin lol
MERICA
Sheesh!
This is so cool and imagine having such a big mouth u can bite it
Anyone else miss the old vat 19 team, I don't watch them anymore bc I don't like the new ppl only the old ppl.
Anyone offended by the fact the aren't wearing masks at home depot?
Plot Twist: Sloan is just going crazy because no one is helping her
I shop at that Home Depot... it's only a matter of time until I'm gonna need some plaster of paris and of course they'll be out of stock!
Happy 4th of july
Can we PLEASE get a hidden in plain sight but with Sloan? I would watch every single second of every episode of that series! PLEASE please please please make it happen!
WHY IS JOEY AND KARA NOT IN THE INTRO THING WHERE HE SAYS "This is vat19 blah blah blah blah blah" WHERE ARE THEY

Happy Independence Day Vat 19!!!
My name is sloane
You uploaded this the day before your independence day so you were celebrating americas birthday a bit early
Who still remembers Dan and Jon?
Happy 4 of July!
I liked the video but something really annoyed me and it was no one was wearing a mask even if there are less cases or covid free you still have to be safe and take precautions it's fine if you don't wear a mask at least social distance
How did Jamie get a mustache and it being white in one day lol
You’ve really inspired me to keep going with my gaming channel.,!
Hi
They didn’t put the joke on a stick
That so cool! I wish I could do that because I was in the middle east because of your work in this case and you are not going through a nutshell or something about the fact of your life or your own relationship but you have to have an I was a very important test and I was in a nutshell for the most sense and watch it all of the hall and I had to go back in time to start to feel the need for the next generation of people who were right and I was watching the first time in the first half and watch the video games in a pickle in a pickle in a pickle and I just didn't see it as you did you just had to get another one of the ven show up on the robotic pig and watch gallery of the ven show and watch gallery of the ven show on the ground zero for a mechanic in a pickle in the middle and a little sticky in a pickle and then when you have a lot to eat in the hall don't worry about it is it just me and the are you a good life who ever gets sponsored and the food and drinks can you SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE the best of the ven show on the robotic pig and the games make her eyes EXTRA light and the other way around cheating on her corpse and the other is the most important part in her is she didn't have any of them to make it for yourself
MERICA
vat 19 is slowly dying

Mom: go work at a mc Donald or something Me: no i want to work at vet 19 Also me after watching this vid- Me: mom ill consider it!
She: hides Jamie: she’s the worst  Me: 😐😐😐
Home Depot employees every time they see them walk in: Ah sht, here we go again  But Hidden in Plain Depot IS a good idea, ngl
They're mixing gummy with the tool they used for the plaster
Anyone else call those bomb pops
this is from VietNam : HAPPY BIRTHDAY USA
i remember when it was Danny and Joey doing the DIY work

This is why we go to school
Plaster definitely can make you curse
The gummy rocketc pop is actually the French flag. 😎Not so American
Slone howcome your glasses never fall of
What are you guys going to do with the rest
Gummies: *exist* Vat19: Hippity Hoppity this is now my property
Three friends is definitely a lot of friends for jaimy!!
Sloane: breathes Jamie: *Peace was never an option*  Every song Sloane puts out is a banger
That's the flag of the nederlands

Why didn't you use Flex Glue? Flex Glue is the best made by Phil Swift!
I am so happy that you guys made another one of these videos and this was not what I was expecting but still I want to eat that so bad also if you guys haven’t already I think you should do a Kalab with this guy called Mark rober he does a lot of cool stuff kind of like that 19 but is it scientific he does like world records of elephant toothpaste and squirrel Obstacle courses I really hope one day you guys do a Kalab with him
You guys should make your on app

Poor foam. Didnt even give it anesthesia before surgery
Jamie ate like 5 gummy rockets in this video
Wwwwwwwwooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwww😻😎😍🤩👌
sloane: its 300 lbs me: they need kyle  kyle: you called

Hi am i early?

“SLOANNNNNNEEEEEEEEEEEEE” - Jamie 2021
This is awesomd
What do do with the giant gummies after u finish them ? Do u eat the and throw the rest away or just store them some where ?
Its not white
Please tell me they waterproofed that bare plaster of paris...
I love the music and the gummy
Can you guys do more tiny toys or giant toy videos pls 😔😁🙏🙏🙏
the lady gaga part tho
Sloan cause baby your a rocket pop best quote on YouTube 🚀🚀🚀🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 Jamie’s lonely in the shop 😂
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸USA ALL THE WAY!!!!
Happy forth of July!
I love the U S A
Wash it to eat it
The fact I’m eating one of these popsicles as I’m watching this.
I wanna be Sloan's best friend!!!
Next you should make a giant jawbreaker
I wonder if the plaster dust comes off easy. 🤔
I was getting nervous every time they poured cause plaster heats when it starts to set. If your hand gets covered in it it will harden before you can clean it off and continue to heat up as it hardens. I read an article about some kind of art student that lost several fingers after getting burns so severe they couldn't save them  after she'd dipped her hands in it.

This is a really cool video but where is all the other people?
Sloane is the best
ayo how did they escape without a face mask?
Just happy birthday USA? Just ignore us in Canada… ok :(
How many gummy popsicles did Jamie eat? 😂
Jamie is a gummy biting expert he bites it like it’s a gooy cookie
Great video
Hidden in plain depot
Thing mussy taste like shit
USA
Always wanted to try molten gummy ☺
Gummy melts though
I swear me and jamie have the same watch
I love these videos!!! Love from nz 🇳🇿
Happy 4 july
Am I the only one who want hidden in plain sight back
*I'm British*
🇺🇲🇺🇲💪
Sloane is like the more immature Danny who somehow gets on Jamie's nerves more than Danny. (Though it's probably acting) And I love it.
8:44
Go to vat19.com
the white looks yllow
Hi friends, I’ve been wondering for a while, where did Joey go/ why did he quit? I know why Jon, Danny, and Kara left, but I’ve been  wondering about Joey. Let me know if you know
early
*cries at how not food safe this is*
Buy kicking it
Treat it like your kids bully
9:43  ERICCC!!!
It looks easy but it isn't
Can we celebrate anything other than America this year? Like…..please?
Am i the only one that saw the dutch flag
Vat19 the mother of all gummy
Jamie: it's unmeltable Me: *turns on the stove
Daniel is the Kyle equivalent but with glasses 😂
I doubt y'all would see this, but next time you guys should use food grade silicon. It won't stick to the gummy like the plaster did.
Wait our they in the future because they said ok we’ll wait for it to dry tomorrow even tho they made it today like I mean what the fluff
It's the french flag
Happy 4th of july even if im not american
Are you still in the office today and can get some more stuff done ✅
I havent watched vat19 in a while. Then this Got recommended and i thought why not. But can someone explain where Joey is?
This is my dream job so in about five years if you see me at your headquarters trying to apply for a job please accept
Yumyyyyyyyyyyuy -----------‐---------------
Lol
You should’ve put in a tarp that is nonstick and when it was ready you can just pull the tarp and I’ll pop out

Where’s Joey?
Because the white is actually yellow it looks like the pan pride flag. IT LOOKS LIKE A PAN POPSICLE.
I felt like vat19 only left 2 employee
I haven't watched vat 19 since the putty bathtub video
Is it just me, or was the voice over that they were doing was a bit annoying and childish
Please tell us why Joey left.  We had an explanation from Jon, Danny, Kara....
did Kara leave?
Wow
Don’t u like clean it before u eat it ?
can we all agree that the old cast this is vat 19 picture was better?
Do a giant avocado plushy
Now this is not clickbait its called watching Soloane and Jamie stressing themsleves out to entertain us for 10 minutes
I,m actually a few days early
Happy early Fourth of July
i like hoq Kyle is doing all the lifting
Fireworks were banned in my state.... So I can just watch this instead!
I introduced my family to Vat19, and I feel like it was one of the best things to ever happen to me. I can now actually buy the products, and talk to people about Vat19.
Just don't like this video because had to see Slone's the Moron's face too many times.  Just irritating . unliking because of her
Its funny because I was eating a bomb pop and then they posted this so I of course watched it! Lol
2:34

Hay Jarm can I work there my real name is Ella Davison and I’m 9 but I am very creative and I will be a very good worker
Where was joey during all of this?
I ALWAYS absolutely love & appreciate Sloane's enthusiasm. She is so excitable about every little thing... Haha! ✌💚

THERES KIDS WATCHING THIS VIDEO (including me)
Can you make the gumby stretch back in stock

Ah yes The Netherlands is now The Americans
Yum
Good lord, I love you losers✨
Eric is so happy.
Vat 19, you've really gone downhill
Sloan: Its hammer time! Jamie: Its chisel time! Jamie: Cmon lets just do this please? Jamie POV: Im using a hammer Sloan POV: Im using a chisel
I REMEMBER SEEING THAT WHEN I WENT THERE
Dude, this ain’t huge, this is just the average American snack.
A M E R I C A

Daily Reminder:Jesus Loves you🙏🏽
Can we just appreciate how much time effort and work that have put into this video just for us😊
I feel like Sloan would be a very weird but very good friend
Vat 19 what happen to everyone else like the Spice queen of vat 19 or Joey
Sloane's singing is lowkey good! haha hope u r mad Jamie
Where’s Joey
I love it
Besides her antics the funnest thing about Sloan is that with her hair you can legit tell how much time has passed between ALL the shots. XD I guess it's lucky that she's not the type to refresh her side cut every few days.
Food
I'm Canadian I don't get it
I love it how jimmy is just making Sloane doing all of the work and he is just telling her to do better. What a true boss
Happy 4th of July
Burgir

Hi
Hh ja
Hello
My Mommy FORCED Me To Watch This, And I Was SHOCKED IN ULTIMATE FAINTMENT!. 84,000 PEICES!??!. Jeez Liouize!.
Before I watch the whole thing I was so scared that you guys are in a mess up but I knew you weren’t so yeah
This thing is making me overthink about diabetes.
The Home Depot people when they see vat 19 people coming in, “oh great, these crackheads”
Ee
Burning questions 19 about the 7 yr pen Can the 7 yr pen draw the olympic track (400 m) And still can write
Omg I’m kind of early this is so cool if you read this please give them a 👍🏻
I got ideas: Cook stuff w/ putty chop all of your existing stress ball Make giant pancakes w/ gummies G u m m y c h i c k e n Yea that’s all I got.
So cool
Ofc they called Kyle to help care it
Slone: this is 300 pounds of gummy  Me: ITS KYLE TIME BABY!!!
I don’t know why but the scene where they are cutting the foam into thirds reminded me of a scene from an anime called Shiki where this doctor is unaliving his wife. (Please don’t look it up the scene is very graphic)
How tall Is it?
Peepeepoopoo check
You guys are so cool
Was the plaster food grade safe?
Everyone: yey it look yummy Me: is that even edible after done or it make your stomach hurt?
Good job 👍👍👍
I love how for americas day they accidentaly made the romania flag because that white is not white it's yellow.
7:10 got my dieing
There should have been a counter for the amount of times Jamie ate a gummy popsicle.
Hey I love this
I'm British so this is really weird to me I've never heard of these and I saw they title and thought ROCKET LOLLYPOP GOING TO SPACE whaaaaaaaaaa

Who's lowkey wanting to see Hidden in Plain Depot?
Danny & Jon were my favorite people from Vat19, but I respected their decision. (subscribed to their channel even) I do love Sloane & Adam a lot now. I wanna call them my Vat19 aunt & uncle. hehe
you posted this 1 day early.
Aww what happened to the gummy bear guy? Did he finally realise you guys were just sellouts and are just doing it for the money now? What a shame... :(
Cool

This popsicle look more like the Romanian flag more than the USA flag.

Why didn’t you Just melt the giant gummy bear
Jamie and Sloane are some of the funniest people ever
I had a bomb pop yesterday- it taste good (not gummy)
Imagine if they made one that wasn't gummy and it melted    dang that would be horrifying, the building would've flooded
So yummy 🤤

Vat19; vault of alien technology 19
Last time i was this early we could go out without masks-😅 Love these vids
in the year 5021 when they dig up the vat19 warehouse and find this then they start believing they evolved from giants

Jamie: this might be our best gummy build The other gummy builds: WHAT AM I A ROACH?!

Funny how ironic Bomb pop looks more like a French Flag than an American flag lmao
Lol I love sloans song
I don't think plastic of Paris is food safe so you probably can't eat it after all that work.
I want to eat it..

Not hygienic people
“what’s your dream job?” me: *umm it’s COMPLICATED*
3:21 I wanted riddle stick

Does anyone miss Danny
SLOANE FOR PRESIDENT 2024
Oh my God I love you people you guys are amazing my favorite one that you’ve done so far what is the cotton candy unicorn because well I’m a girl and I love unicorns so that’s why
Rocket pop song is Katy Perry "Firework" I'm pretty sure

EAT  EAT EAT EAT EAT EAT EAT EAT
I watching Vat19 since i was 3year old till now ;-;
this could not be awsome , this WILL be awsone
Love your vids
Hii
I need it
Those gummys look good
Loving the first aid Fanny pack
Hi
Jamie and Salone are the new iconic duo at Vat 19 (Sorry if the spelling is wrong)
Awesome!
If you compare gummy with ice you can actually see the difference because usually Ice melts really fast and gummy doesn’t melt only if you boil it then it will melt but not when you hold a gummy
Jammie screw up 😂
hey, vat 19! you're pretty creative I must say.
I was like...     Notifications *       Me: OMG IM FISRT IM FISRT! YAYAYAAA-         until when I see 111 coments*                                                             ...

#6MINUTESEARLY And HAPPY BDAY USA
Jamie and sloans friendship is great
(grandparents account) it has been six or seven minutes and there already 2k+ people watching
LOVEE YOUREEE VIDSSSS
A lot could go wrong...  Jamie: and ill blame it all on you!
I love this video
At the end: so what did you kill?   "Gummy"
Omg its like 12:05 in the morning right now and i should be asleep
This could be awesome  It IS awesome!
The popsicle looks like a plastic bottle and the nub is the cap
It was like absolutely giant I’ll take me like you used to finish that like years and years they’ll take me to finish that
First
This COULD be awesome!  "could" Just like I "could" be a millionaire.
hi
Vat19 in 7y Making a 20000 pound Russian flag
This Could be awesome but also it could not
The next video can you do white elephant or guessing  ALL of the slimes by smelling them or feeling and have them blind folded
Jamie's jacket in the intro looked like he took an American flag, folded it and put a zipper on it
Very late early!
I will rather eat a gummy Popsicle more than the original because usually the original starts to melt but when you have the gummy Popsicle then when you leave it in the sun it would not melt
Lots of  Love from India vat 19🇮🇳❤️❤️❤️❤️🇮🇳
Wish best for you. Doing really good. Hope we will build up good connection in the future. Looking forward for your response.  Also, be part of our family we will become yours too 💜💜😊
