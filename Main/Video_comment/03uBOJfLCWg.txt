Hi Moriah I’m a big fan. Can you give me a shout out. My name is Elaina.(yes I know that is an unusual name.)
Hi everyone

Love this! You never cease to amaze me.
2021
What 🤔🤨
When you thought Moriah was actually gonna make something black and white
you go girl and sorry for commenting a while after the actual video
love the dress
I was literally so confused when she only had put white paint on 🤣 I knew Mariah would have to put colour on
when she painted the confetti white,  I was like who are you and what have you done with Moriah
I love it :)
Ok so painting over all other stuff on my clothes
Moriah, you should make your own kit for kids like a squishy decorating one?
I love you’re Moriah Elizabeth NYE dress video
Can you do a shout out PLEASE❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I was on the community post and saw it especially I live in India so your video comes at Saturday 3 am in the morning so I have to watch at Saturday when I wake up😔😊
Moriah do you have kids?
Hey do you play animal jam
AMAZING I KNOW ALL YOU DID WAS ADD SOME LINES ON A DRESS BUT IT LOOKS AMAZING
"Isn't it pretty... BORING"
me when Moriah started to paint the dress white:  THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING R U SERIOUS IT SO PLAN- Moriah : Now for the fun part, ThE cOlOuR  Me: That's more like it
Is confetti just adult sprinkles???
I love you
Who ar you
Hi I am Dixie and when I get older I am going to do you-tube channel like you Squishy makeover's I watch your video after home schooling!!!
You look really pretty moriah🥰
Moriah but but but but but  me ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm but

You are  the best
This is my first time seeing moriah in a dress 😱
She found a way to include rainbows in 2 minute video...interesting...interesting
I kinda...liked...it with just the white confetti
How did I miss this??
Ikr
Mariah should where dresses more often!!!! She looks AMAZING , AWSOME ,CUTE , GORGEOUS, FABULOUS, BEAUTIFUL AND PRETTY!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
hi
hi Moriah I love your vids and I love what you make
My heart is always broken on Monday so I am happy I found this
I was so taken aback when she didn’t do color at first I thought she was a fake!
Dec 31st 2020 '_'  =_=  '_' Jan 22nd 2021   **visible confusion**
I love the dress. It makes me think of the '90s like Saved by the Bell because of the confetti and the colors that she used.
I love it (I love you)
Hmm have I seen that dress before in a suuuuper old video? Or is that a different one? The video is girls troubles: getting ready. about 7 years ago
:0
This video is great
How anoying is the flower crown that is no straight on the bride in the chicken family?
I feel like anyone who follows this channel but doesn’t follow Moriah is/was very confused while watching
Bye bye 2020 yay
is this realy tho??
The people that thumbs this down can’t see properly I’m sorry
I found this bc I’m a HUGE FAN and I loved it! Ofc
In the thumbnail moriahs smile was a bit sketchy...
Its kinda weird seeing moriah on this channel ngl
I LOVE MORIAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi *hi*
Wait- how come I’ve never heard of this channel TELL MEH
the dress moriah made is so pretty
ngl when i originally read the title i thought it was a moriah elizabeth and bill nye crossover
Why in the world did I just get to see this 10 days later?
Happy 2021!🥳🥳🥳
I really like that dress it’s very cute and I love her transitions!
I love how the dress matches her nails
Idk why, but this almost feels like someone else edited this. Maybe I’m just being dumb, the the editing style is kinda different. Like when she’s painting the dress, and she snaps for a transition, normally she would edit the clip so her snap is muted, but you can hear the snap this time. Also, the editing is more dramatic than her’s normally is. Maybe I’m just overthinking this completely.
I kinda feel like the confetti called for the sprinkle song.... but ok. 😋
why is this not on here channel
I really love how she always just adds a little bit of her own unique touch, and don't forget her humor!! :)
Isn't it funny that this video has more views than the other videos where creators said hello 2021 combined? 👀 I'm talking about the ones where a single person is saying something Like RuPaul or Brad Mondo 😂
How did they get this vid
love ittttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
YOU GO GIRL
I love it!!!
I was so short
Just saw video where they show you joining tiktok as well as some other tiktoks, yeah bad idea tiktok is quite addictive and a scam
YAY RAINBOW QUEEN
First time we see het with a dress on Ooh what about fire works next time.
I love it 😍😍 looks amazing as always
When I’m a adult: My child: mommy what year was the worst? Me: well my dear it was 2020
It's sad that moriah wasn't in Mr beast's rewind
thats not confetti its ✨sprinkles✨
MORIAH ELIZABETH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I think She looked beautiful in the dress
202i 🤣
Happy New Year! 2021🥳
IT’S SOOOO PRETTY LOVE YOU MORIAH! 😀
Is this why she did not post last week love your vids
“I like to paint on all kinds of things.”  *Yes, yes we know.*
OMG I LOVEEE MORIAH ELIZABETH

She is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo corky it's funny
Hi I am sorry I didn't know there was another video

Isn't crazy how her channel grew so much to now, I mean she's making a youtube original!
Y'all, i never saw her in a dress before she looks gorgeous.
I love how she designed the dress. I watch Moriah Elizabeth to give me idea's on what to do because i love art!
Moriah Elizabeth you need to put a video about baking a cake squishy you've painted. ANY CAKE SQUISHY
love your work
i love moriah❤️❤️❤️
Lovely - I wish wish the pattern was sparkly, for NYE
I think that’s the best modeling we’ve seen from moriah yet
I have a pickle       *the dino*
Me: ............. That was not moriahs normal vidio it took 2 mins     we have 20 mins!
I’ve never seen moriah in a dress lol she is so pretty!!
I’m getting cousin derp, pickle, and Georgie bundle I’m so excited
At first I was like wow no rainbow then of course she put rainbow
I thought that she was going to put sprinkles on
My mom won't let me paint my clothes so😭😢
Simply perfect moriah.          I won't miss 2020 anyone else?
I’m happy we got and extra video from here :)
"I have a thing for customizing stuff"  *You do? I've been watching you for 3 years, haven't noticed!*
This person is stealing the creadit of someones vidio and nonsponser
We all be lookin at her yt channel then find this (mind blown)
I just got an idea you should do a squishy wreck over!! You should Wreck won of your  squishy’s and then fix it!
Liked this video....Oop my phone was upside down lmfao now it’s fixed.
happy new year
I was expecting this is be totally different than her normal stuff but, it felt like I was watching a video of her’s just shorter.
*MERRY CHRISTMAS!*
Happy new year girl and see ya tomorrow 🥳
Ohmygosh it almost looks like confetti galaxy. tHIS IS AWESOME!!!! <3
Maybe this is why she didn’t post 👀

This girl is the reason I want to be an artist ty moriah for inspiring me
Who else wanted here to say sPrInKlEs
So this is wht she had to do that Friday....
Is it just me? I does it look like pickles spots???
Moriah Elizabeth is The best !!!
Moriah: next week i'm not going to post a video  Me: finds this video 🤔  POV: guess she could help herself without making a new amazing thing
h.ello 2o2i
Me missing moriah after one week because she didn’t post for the holidays:👁💧👄💧👁
ok i admit i paniced a little bit bc i thought she was going to leave the confetti plain white. then i reasoned with myself saying: she isnt capable of doing that with a sane mind
First time seeing moriah elizabeth in a dress in a long time
Confetti?? Am I even surprised.... No I'm not.. anyway ima buy a pickle and cousin derp now Baii.
This made my day (as every Moriah video does) 😂
That dress was beautiful
“Don’t ever be afraid to customize your stuff” I am afraid of my mother yelling at me
love the nails girrrrrrllll!
I was like how am I gonna survive without moriah  this week... well here she is the week she isn’t posting on her own channel!
thats it . make more  pleas
Wow this was fun to watch!
I want a dress like that in real life
Now I know why she didnot post
why this not in the acctull moriah channel
That’s so nice of her to post an extra video
Why didn’t she post this on her channel ah whatever’s
I couldn’t picture Moriah in a dress until... 1:59
MORIAH!!!!! I literally was like “Moriah posted” and then I realized oh
Cake 🍰 confetti 🎂 🧁 cakeeee
Says confetti thanks for the confetti cake
Not me, watching this with my pickle the dinosaur plush...
I love the little confetti dress!!
In my opinion I would never see her in a dress
Agreed
U need to bring back the backing series i love them
Here before 1,000 comments :))
“Call it a super power 😉”
*Ah yes, the rainbow queen is back with more rainbow*
So skinny, I think she looks better with more weight on her. Not a lot but like a few more extra lbs.
Pickle
Ummm I had a ad that was about YouTube and stuff (it was pretty long) and I thought it was the video lol

I dont have a party dress, so can I have one?? (Especially if my favorite YouTuber did it)
U know she was on google like: songs songs songs oh! Ill choose this for my song while making this dress
yes
Was this the reason why she didn't post on 1st Jan on her channel?

She should use 3 large peach squishes to make a snowman!...   or      She can decorate a pre-made snowman.
HEYYYY
Moriah Days Ago: I Am Not Posting On Friday Also Moriah: POSTS FRIDAY

This dress was totally customized for me 😅😋
Wow YES MORIAH GOT ON YOUTUBES CHANNEL!!

:)
idk how she can do it
Okay but can we talk about that hair flip at 2:14.. girl you SLAYYY 💖👏
Love it.  Did you use fabric paint?
Super cute!
the thumbs down are just people jealous of her modeling skills lol. Love you Moriah!
I Knox I’m late but I love her she I da best
Ide honestly wear this
WOW I love the dress you made it looks so much better, keep making panting vids
I got scared and thought that she would leave it at white confetti, but then I realized that its moriah
I wish I could say I like it, but I just don’t 😭
why is this posted here? not on her channels
I love this video especially the modelling parts and love this design too . I l9ve confetti though that probably why you chose it 😐🙄
People who dislike her videos do not know what they're missing out on
Why does she look like that on the thumbnail
how come she never wears dresses in her vidios
I love moriah
The dress turned out great.  Shocked there wasn't some glitter it there but.... great dress.  Definitely one of a kind.
I think she added confetti because it looks like sprinkles lol
Can you do more of fixing things I ruined please
Moriah’s quickest customization ever
Anyone else never seen her in a dress?
Whoa who is she JK I know who she is I'm her number one fan
Lol does this count as posting yaaaaaaaa
I’m happy she just posted but I wish she’d do it more often
Even her short videos are amazing
“I have a thing for customizing things”  *I would’ve never guessed lol*
Just me or did she act differently than in her actual videos? 🤔
Omg hi Maria Elizabeth
is it just me or does moriah look diffrent ????????????????????
Question... how many subs does this channel have?    😗 👉👈
Wooooo!
Is this channel actually from youtube
Um Moriah customizes a dress but literally never wears them on camera lol
0:30 Moriah: Isn't it pretty.....? Me: It sure is!😄 Moriah:BoRiNg?!!! Me:Ya it's pretty boring!😄😐😗
Yay I was so sad when she said she was not going to post now I am happy 😊
The fact that I’m 2 days late makes me so sad like if u agree or this has happened to u :(
Super weird to hear her say her name instead of just "Hi. It's M.E."
Did want one not notice that she didn't play the intro
The idea of it all is amazing 😉
I love how this turned out Moriah!
I missed you
moriah if your seeing the comments please make cuepy the human cupcake in real life like bake her (sorry this comment sounds wierd
Impresses me evrytime!
So happy to have Moriah for 2021, a little brigthness💕
She definitely acts different on YouTube  Originals
Why do I feel like this would take the same immense amount of pressure and hard work to make this small video as a normal video? Or is it just me
Can i have the dresses
*HAPPY NEW YEAR FRIENDS!!!*
Moriah puts so much effort into YouTube, even on her week off she still gives us a short video.
Please post some video on next week, i'll have talent exams and i'll be stressed tf out. You are the only youtuber who can keep me calm...
Beautiful! Now follow the line                                                   I                                                   I                                                   I                                                   I                                                   I                                                   -> @
I definitely needed to see moriah wink. It was adorable
I want you make 4 video in a week
“Isn’t it pretty... Boring” Me: laughing so hard!
People we love to start the new year with FOOD moriah PANIT!!!!
Wow  your 26th on treanding
The post was real and so was your modeling! Great job Moriah and I ❤️ u
I'm afraid to customize stuff because of the insane amount of paint spillage
Me trying to paint a tin but never finished then it got thrown away 😂😂😭😭Moriah painting every thing u can think of me I am gonna do a cute pickle tin
The wink at 0:51 was LEGIT!😊
If you are a fan of M.E (Moriah Elizabeth) than your 2020 was better
#26 on trending!
Legends -In their bed (Binging youtube) -Not full screen -reading comets Aka me
"Isn't it PRETTY… *BORING*?!"
When she started in white I was like whaaaaaaa????
I love this!!
“No-one will have this dress” I have a black dress like yours and I can make it like that :)
Moriah: I have a thing for customizing objects  Me: Like we didn't know...
You re too honest... no sorry
Lady, let me tell you something. I rarely watch YouTube videos unless I specifically need to learn a certain talent or DIY project. And I ESPECIALLY do not watch fashion videos bc well, I'm pretty fashionable already. ("Call it my superpower." Lol! I loved that!) I'm kidding, of course. Sort of. But as I was scrolling thru, idk why or what supernatural force compelled me to stop, but I did long enough to see your video! First off, not only is the idea and the dress genius and adorbes, but YOU my dear have something the others do not. Something that causes me not to watch YouTube videos. What is it? I'll tell you bc I'm nice like that. YOU, my dear amazing person, ARE ACTUALLY PLEASENT AND FUN TO LISTEN TO AND WATCH! NO JOKE! I know! I was shocked too! Lol. Really, keep up the great work! Youre going places! 👍👍👍💖 (omg! Know what else I love?! I did not see one negative comment! NOT ONE! Not only does this speak volumes for you, Mariah, but it says a lot about your followers! Way to go to both you and your tribe! Y'all are just pure awesome!)
Hey looks like we got a video
Where did you found this video this is not available on her channel
I love you so much I was waiting your video last friday
Hi
No idea who she is, dunno why this is trending.
My friend came over and I told her I was so sad you are not posting on Friday and I told her I had to wait that week and not get a Moriah Elizabeth Notification! Until this video came out 😁
This wole video made me smile.. u? 2021 yeah...nah
Wait! The matching shoooooes Moriah!!! I feel so unfulfilled! 😭💔
Moriah: Call it a super power *winks*  Me: 😳 I feel *scared*
When she said I'll see ya around I was totally expecting her to say see ya next week and I was like MoRiAh. HoW dArE yOu.
Why was this video so short? Does anyone know how painful it is to wait a FULL WEEK to watch another video? Moriah is the only person that keeps me through the week. 😭😭😣😣😩😩
Love her!!
Yez
I have never met anyone with the same spelling as me. This is kinda neat.
YES MORIAH 💜👑💜
MORIAH????????😨😨😨😨😨
They really did her dirty with that thumbnail
i thought for a moment that she wasn't going to color in the confetti...
all i hear is ‘there are so many reasons to play candy crush, if you haven’t played the game download it now’ ad
we stan a queen!!!
Put a mask on!! Gross woman!
Omg u looked pretty In the dress and the sad thing is that no moriah memes :(

😎🤸‍♀️🔥😎
Can you do a non edit video
Why do I feel like I remember that dress from like a video 6 or 7 years ago...   I think it’s from the video “girl troubles getting ready” on her channel time stamp on that video one minute 40 seconds if you want to judge.
bye 2020 u frickin SUCK
Moriah: says that black dress is classic for- Me: funerals
that dress is so cute!!!!
I loved how it turned out!
Moriah: insults dress Moriah-* takes back her insults*

🙋🏽‍♀️

She- has the patience to do that   Me- don't even have patience to draw a full on paper fill pic! 😂
Imagine spending so long painting tiny shapes on fabric for a 3 minute video. My impatient self could never!
The confetti looks like Pickle's spots. (Moriah fans will know what I mean)
This looks so fun

i love extra vids from Moriah
I'm thinking that this going to Moriah Elizabeth's next vid Art things to do when your bored
All moriah fans here

Everybody: we love moriah that she is posting   Me: IS THAT THE BLACK DRESS FROM HER GETTING READY VIDEO
I love that dress! It is so pretty, you did a great job.
Moriah: Isn't it pretty........................BORING
Moriah to all plain things:  *I will find you..and I will customize you.*
This is a perfect dress for Moriah Elizabeth, she could wear it in public and no one would stare because its ME original- and everyone knows how creative she is.....perfect 💯
I had a feeling she wouldn't abandon us this Friday ❤

Dear Friends,    Finally, 2020 has come to an end. What a year it has been, for the whole world.

I take this opportunity to sincerely wish you, your family, friends and colleagues Happy New Year 2021. I wish you great health, regular feel of love and joy with many moments of peace and gratitude. Last but not least, I also wish you lots of courage to follow your dreams.  *All the Best & Happy New Year 2021*

the dislikes is from another dresses in moriah’s closet that she didn’t pick for customisation =)
Happy new year everyone!
you go Moriah!!
That dress is from girls trouble getting ready video I love that video ❤❤💚💛💙
Omg I love <3 that dress it’s so CUTE :D and how she modeled that dress was not bad
I am missing her intro anyone missing leave a like
At least all us moriah fans git to see a flimps of her making art
I had no idea she posted till I saw her video on YouTube
Moriah pls make another baking video pls Moriah I really liked your series of make food squishy’s in to real food
wow moriagh says she is not posting me oh a video i am fine with that
Its so adorable. I love how u look in it Moriah. See ya next week. (*Cough cough* Show Jordan *Cough* 😶)
Even a small video makes us happy  And happy New year 🎉🎊🎉🎊
My birthday is New Year’s Eve! So that’s MY dress
If there were cloning machines, I would go to her house and clone that to INFINITE. Reply if ya agree Also if you agree that she gets funnier every friday dislike the comment
Confetti is just paper sprinkles. Therefore, I motion that the sprinkle song be added to this video
Why isn’t this video at least 10 minutes?????
Yup this is moriah. 19000% her.
I love the drees that moriah was wering I'm an artist and I make dresses and i love jow moriah elizabeth has a million of ideas so that is so nice
Bit of useless information: This is the four hundredth twenty third comment on this video :)
The video is incomplete without our Moriah memes😂
Who is this youtuber "Youtube originals?" 'cause your channel name is "Moriah Elizabeth" 😐😐 I'm suspicious
Happy NEW YEAR 🥳🥳🤩
The people who thumbs down her vids are just jealous of her art
I love how you are so dedicated to this that you forget that you can’t post this week 😊😐
No one: that black dress could be hmmm CONFETTI!
The people who disliked this must have meant Dis I like.
Anyone else obsessed with the music she uses in her vids
Who else clicked on this immediately clicked on this
At the end I realized I never saw moriah in a dress
Guys not only is there a sprinkles song but theres a confetti song
Ya you posted
I would wear that dress everyday
The color in the video is SUPER VIVID. Anyone else notice that? Just me?
I rlly love that dress omg
I love how she says “Hopefully you can’t see the cat hair on it” as she pulls one off! lol! Love you Moriah!
This video is perfectly acceptable, as a new Moriah Elizabeth video until she posts next week.
I love the dress so much! I would actually wear a dress like that if I had one.
More OPIE in 2021!!!
“With paint!” Of course with paint it’s her true love
the confetti matches your nails!!!!! love the dress btw, 10 out of 10 would wear! love you moriah!!!
I love that dress!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Uesss
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
MARIAH
I take issue with the fact that, dispite Confetti being the Sprinkles of Decoration, no Sprinkle Song was featured in this clip
You should do a diamond painting for a video
Oh look 25 dislikes. How sad. Oh wait. 4.5k likes. Sorry haters, majority rules.
The day someone moriah nows see her video
I love the dress so pretty and so you
Omg so cute
She never dissapoints us! Thx moriah! (I'm on my brothers account lol)
Yayyy im really glad she ended up posting something this week, even if it was short! If you're reading this I hope you have an amazing 2021!! 🥳🎉
Love it!!
I LOVE IT                                               THAT IS SO COOL                                             HELLO 2021

0:20 the little black dress LBD as known on project runway           🤗 thanks for clicking down this far
I’m glad we still get a vid ❤️✨- in a way
💕💕
This video feels really awkward 🙊
i wanna know if she actually wore it on new year , anybody else ?
HOW DOES THIS ONLY HAVE 30K VIEWS?
N o i c e
I <3 your vids moriah
I’m a tom boy so I wouldn’t wear the *dress* , but if it were a shirt I would wear it.
Yaaaaaaaassssssssssssss I get to see Moriah paint on stuff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 🌈🌈🌈🖌️🖌️🖌️🖌️🖌️🖌️🖌️
For a second, I got comfused that she wasn't using the spinkle song, but then I remembered that sprinkles and confetti are different.
None will have the same dress as you. If they don’t rob you
I think you should add confetti to all your merchandise at the back as like a new trend  everyone copy and paste this message
And also why is there not a smile emoji and not this one 😁😀 like this one 😉 but not winking why is that? Someone tell me!
Bye Moriah! I'll see you in a week in your next video 😉
The people that clicked the thumbs  down button they prob have their phone upside down
HAPPY YEAR OF MORIAH
“It’s pretty. . . BORING” 😂😂😂. Love you, Moriah.  Looking forward to Fridays in 2021!
Can we take a minute to appreciate this wonderful person she even made us a little vid when she is even. In a holiday <3 love you so muchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

Woah
I ain't never seen Moriah in a dress, and to the point where I thought she wasn't going to wear it So i felt weird when she ACTUALLY wore it      Don't misunderstand, i don't mean that she looks bad in it, so if you were planning on coming for me in the comments....don't
She should customise heeled shoes to match
My day always lights up when I see that Moriah Elizabeth posted. Happy 2021 everyone :)
