*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Duke got the funniest lines in this
Made Fanum speak a whole other  language 🤣🤣🤣
Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.  John 3:36  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans‬ ‭6‬:‭23 Jesus Christ is the only way, seek Him while He may be found, before it’s too late, tomorrow is never promised..

Oh agent start a foundation for kids back to school and college scholarships for the under privileged community. Amp back to school. Amp scholarship camp. Where u pay for books. Also Amp college food club. Where you pay for students food. Pretty much use or get into connect with these new food producers with meals to fix for yourself. Which it connects to your weight lose and fight for diabetes and obesity. You can start small and eventually Amp will be a staple. Find students at HBCU. And low income schools. Get a Walmart or something and get it closed for private event and then have schools bring students and parents for back to school shopping.
