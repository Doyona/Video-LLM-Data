my team beat that we got 90
Only not og’s can like this comment
What is this game mode
Complete set up. Nothing genuine about this video
Andrew 😂
Lachy  went insane bro😂
Here in 2025 I am
Lazar with 5 0:03
3:15 Jort storm kicks in
Lachy was the goat here😊
pete and his squad got 80 in an unreal game
Nadav12345676 is my id
Crazy to think that Lannan has more subs then Lachlan now😭 0:12
It says 81 but on the thumbnail it adds up to 71
Lachlan killed Andrew 1107
My squad has the most kills I had 40 kills in on squad game
Hi
13+21+5+25 is 64??
lannan in the back worrying about his balloons lol
Tg stream sniper Andrew was in the game
3:41 no way dude killed Andrew, the best streamsniper
ANDREW BACK @Andrew113110
8:39 he got two legendary in a row
Did anybody see that lachy killed tgs streamsniper andrew
do this with vin the carry lufu for finding emotes she claims she has and timmy for timmy and u lachy
Hey where’s fresh ?
3:32 Andrew from typical gamer
Ain’t no way Lachy got Andrew in his game
the kil record is 88 not 81
How did peterbot make a record with 80 if they got 81???? Please explain
You can’t get the kill record unless your in ranked and you do it
So not a real record  Only a custom games with your over million viewers record…… right……. Clickbait fake
Jort storm
How is this video 5 months old? That is impossible! How long does it take to edit and upload these videos? Because chapter 5 has been current for over a year now. What the hell!?
I actually broke bcz my squad got 85
Who else watching after someone got 81 in ranked and 40 in a tournament
In the first seconds of the video isn’t his math wrong 😮
He got 64 kills not 62
Andrew was there
Is it just me or I the quality bad
andrew didnt stream snipe tg for once
there is no way lannon got 16 kills
Peterbot doing this in unreal
why did you like this comment?bruhhhh
9:58 blud didn't see the skybase😩🥴

One time my friend got 79 and sent me a picture of

Top comment?

The most I’ve ever gotten in duos is like 24, this record is crazy!
Cold death cash and peterbot dropping 80 kills in unreal💀

The first time i ever saw you i said what kind of name is "Law-sha-lon" and havnt been able to shake it. That is who i know you as. You should have seen my gfs reaction when i said it!
You are better then ninja
I dare you to 1v2 lazarbeam and looter lava map oke make it a video best of 3  1 first wins gets 10000 money 💴 okay 👌
Bro that he was sigma ☠️🥶👁👄👁brooooo 😂😂
Imagine this in ranked
Kills
I got 64 with my friends and they where not stream sniper
Would be so much cooler if you actually earned the kills in a real match. This is just dumb
I subscribe
Can I join pwr my username is myaowen2020 I have 13% win rate add me in 2 day’s from
bro just do 360 2:17
Higsky 62
the mob farm was smart
why was everyon's killa a multiple of nine?!
Sucks how your buddy mentions the mostly fake lobby of people laying down to yall @11:30 ... You def didn't like that part!!! Lol
HAHA I love the thumbnail, it makes the video honestly
No shot he said I’m expecting the genius world record to be knocking at my door any second now
T
“There’s a queue for the reboot” 💀
can u ask lazerbeam to add me on fortnit pls
i got 30 kills in a solo
Mommy
Tell us RattZ
Team pls backroomsyeet12
Hey can I join the P WR
Imagine you were playing ranked☠️
Rat pedal works good huh
Is it just me or the bgm is slimcicle song
00:43 WHAT DID HE SAY??
That is 64 kills not 62
Marrow broke this record a month ago with 85 elims
that's not a fair record.  people were just giving up and letting you kill them.
This is part 2 electric boogaloo of the video when lazar beam and all killed a lot of them back in chapter 1
How can you even call this a record when half of the kills are given to them by stream snipers
Lannan reminds me of myself in this situation lol
Why is the Jort storm instrumental in the background
If rebooted 100 kills whould be crazy
16:21 why was he so suprised that he killed the person when he shot him?
I was in the live
It’s actually 81
Bro you have to invite a completely new player to the squad make them party leader then do it again
lazarbeam is the biggest yapper ever
I just got a 78 kill game we were 3 off
Love you guys but happy to see loserfruit beat the score shortly after
I was playing duos and I got 31 kills
81 for Kobe
jort storm in the backround
Where did bro get 62 it's 64
It’s not a record,it’s a streamsnipers
Nice videos the are so good i love them
thumbnail numbers add up to 61 kills btw
“He’s a small YouTuber shows channel slightly 21MILLION!
And pc players say controller players have aimbot
Cheese am I right
Naw
Wa happened to radius
Am I the only one who though of ninja saying streeeaaamm sniiiipiinggg after they said to report the ninja
Of course lannan had only 9 lmao
Am I the only person that saw "Black Bigger"
Everybody go to 8:14 and look at the amount of amo he has on his second weapon
Yuh
This teacher grades this a C-. First 10 kills were given to em haha. GGs though - still crazy high kills!
no but trxypyfn is goated they killed him like 6 times
wait i saw loserfruit's kill record video before this one and i thought she was trying to beat the record set 5 years ago, but its even funnier that she just did it like the day after
7:54 does my man not know he’s a sweat
no you didnt another squad did better, sorry aussie
Me and my friends got 52
World record but really proceeds to cheat it
I saw this live from Lazar’s livestream and it’s so funny seeing the difference between their gameplay. After Pleasant, Lazar just saw stream snipers and was just flying around with Balloons and then Lachlan was dealing with actual real players.
All of them should get banned for that
This one didn’t age too well
Since when were there glider redeploy
Nice
Nobody will know that I hate 🧒🏿
Andrew with the Lachlan skin 😂
It's a crime to not have worthy in this
lazar: lachy send me the pros on your pwr team 😂😂😂😂
Lmao is the background music “Jort storm”
Believe me or don’t believe me but I just figured out that Australia’s best Fortnite player goes to my local dentist which my mum and brother work at
Technically lazarbeam has it with 160
you coulda killed your teammates for 84, by fall damage  still hella impressive, i was in the live when it happened
nbdy will know why this comment has no likes
It is 88 in a tornement
Why does this comment have so many likes🤪🫣
bro does lachlan try to do an english accent
0:44 did anyone think he said the n-word??
Why is fresh retired
https://youtube.com/watch?v=qPgFsZB3zOE&si=lL_bR4lfSNwPURrI
@0:02 Doesn’t 25 + 5 + 21 + 13 equal 64? 😂 Also I think 9 kills is an all time record for Lannan.
Loserfruit couldn’t hold back
Mr savage Mngrall and Clix had 85
I love how I just watched lufu's world record
He’s now still the MrfreshLachy
No one will ever know how this comment got so little likes
Well the best I’ve done in squads is 77 and we did it before this so technically we had the world record. 😮
Damn is that big ass hole in lannon wall from dealin with the sidemen 🤔💀
bro lacy got 2 legendary weapons in a row and wasn't bothered(deagle and combat) that's so funny lmao
craazzzyyy
I remember when he was just a Minecraft YouTuber 🥲
https://www.twitch.tv/crazezenttv Tune in to the live stream
3:36 bro Andrew was there😭
do 2v2 clix x mongrall vs alex x looter
Nice vid
1:57  Gaypap killed lazar
false stream snipers helped
jit crazy, blood hoppin, crypt walkin
Now do the same but in ranked.😎
Fake
tell fresh to😢😢 come back
That's 64 kills bruh who is your editor 💀
I was in this game not even stream sniping😂
People who were watching Lazarbeam's stream  👇
How has Lannan only managed to get 9 in a game like that😂😂😂
I got 76 kill win gg
No streaming sniping I dropped 59 in trios and my teamates got a combined 3
you guys got 64 kills not 62 I added it up
nah lachlan needs to go back to school! 13+21+5+25=62!!! 😂😂😂
i was one of these kills lmao
Me and one of my friends got 39 kills without stream snipers i mean it was almost all bots but still
Ninja
Has to be a real player to many bots in the game now. Back then there were no bots so those records still count
i cant use your code i use code  lufu
He tied KOBE
I got 57 kills in squads ranked
These adults destroyed all the 9 year old boys playin
Lachy's better at range with his gold scar then he was with the hunting rifle LMAO!!!
Boys,somebody got this amount in a tournament 😅
Can I be in PWR my name is Baahaba 😅😅
They definitly reverse boosted
Does this even count since half the players surrendered their weapons and just let you kill them 😂😂😂
So do y'all put tomato sauce/ketchup in the fridge or the cupboard?
I bet he plays fortnite to meet children
I will be there that time when lachy doesnt give himself the most kills in the thumbnail
Suprisingly Lachy was the best int the squad, keep up the great work!
i ate a cat
Bro i joined the srram to lazarbeam saying, "oh i got 1, oh wait it was you"
Must be easy to break a record when they dance in front of you or drop all there loot and stand there to get shot
lol I have 87 Kills
Math ain’t matching
I’m coming back to fortnite soon 😈
alot more bots integrated into matches, i managed to get a 40 bomb just the other day, seems a lot easier to get kills
Insane world record! 81 kills and all of them were stream snipers/bots. Crazy!!!
Guy in the golf cart is a real one
What happened to “Fresh”
Watching out of curiosity im amazed people still play this lol looks pretty healthy still.
NINJA!? My bros capping
i got 34 and my buddy got like 7. 41 in duos
Some friends and I got 70 kills in regular trios
W😊
So many real players half of his kills were people who let him kill them lol
How do you know that's the record? I doubt Guinness will start giving awards for in video game firsts.
this doesent seem legit since like half the kills is stream snipers but still a good vid
they actually had 64 kills (For their old record)
https://youtu.be/kTgv7Qcxkoc?si=qY1DdvoQ8tEMDP4J
later still the funniest lol
https://youtu.be/YpsvBO-qFek?si=SaO66dH5AdTOEm2Q
Bro lazar is more popular than u
Here
He has your name as fresh I'm crying 😂
Bro got a Kobe’s highest scoring game
Thats 64😂
watched it live it was a great stream
This is where Fresh usually shows up....😢😂😮😂
i kept thinking lachys cam froze..just shows how much he doesn't move at all when zoned in 😅
64* kilsl
Lazar getting the MOST KILLSSSS LETS GOO
Lachlan aim
I have the picture if anybody needs proof but from an actual game me and my squad tied the record in an actual game
Loved watching this live
My brother got killed by pwr sync
13:19 thats me in the kill feed
1v1 me bot
the difference between lachlan's skill in fortnite and in the new minecraft pack videos is funny lol
Did anyone ever heard Lachy saying how killing fake players the best at 5:10
How is your aim so good I’m jealous 😂😂
how come youve been uploading so much on this and not your main
“81 like Kobe”🐍🐍🐍
8:55 i don't think lannan even knows abt the fast revive😭
Come on me and my brother and friend trio squad and got 71
damn, it’s crazy how kobe has effected this generation🫡🔥
Yo Lachlan I have hit some nasty clips on a hoverboard do you think you could check them out
Might have to check if you also set the record for most revives/reboots in a game..
Like this comment  👇
Anyone else see lachy pull back to back holds from chests?
2:42 Was me
Like if ur not sus
Love how the thumbnail has Elf and Gingy brings me back 😌
Bro ain’t even playing rank
How u change your hit marker to look like that
How does that count when people just come and sacrifice
can u pls gift me the battle pass my user is TheKidWwhoCantWin
I JUST WATCHED THE OLD VID LOL
6:32 ayo 🤨 📸
A lobby with ai stream snipers don't really count as a fair win.   But still it's a good accomplishment   Good job guys
Poggers Lachy
VIDEO NHU CON CAC
No way
JORT STORM JORT STORM COMING TONIGHT!!!!!!
Australia servers is its own game💀
Why not main channel video
bro lachy really said lazarbeam is a small channel even though lazar has more subs
“We broke the fortnite elimination record… with the help of stream snipers”
Tfue is back🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Its 83 now, Bucke and a few other people did it a few weeks ago
Lachy always has the best content
Lachlan, lazar, Alex and looter thinking they got the record Nice eh 30s customs: 😂 😂
That's not the record
I dropt a 48 today in a real match
I was literally watching that video when he posted this
This doesn't count this is a custom game you told players to go into a game and let you kill them unsubscribed
That’s crazy cuz I swear someone else just set it 😂
the record is 82
Can u gift me the battle pass pls my user is the TheKidWhoCantWin i like watching ur videos
i thought this was the old video when it popped up on my recommended
Does anyone know why his damage looks like that?
yeah, but this doesn't really count, does it? if we're counting people purposely getting eliminated, then NickEh30  probably has the world record. if you did this without any of you streaming, then it would've been impressive.
Half the kills were viewers?
I was one eofff theemmmm
How do you get your visuals looking like that?
andrew11707 on YT  is the goat of streamsniping
I just won, with zero kills. Could not find any players. Last one accidentally jumped off a building.
I got 25 kills solo vs squad and won but i didint get a crown why
This isn’t a world record almost all these kids were stream snipers or AI bots and the 71 kill record was done in a tournament
nah, I got the record of 96 kills solo
The record is 87 kills tho
Hit Kobe’s record but now you need wilt
i was in the kill feed at 2:39 seconds lol
Nick eh 30 be like
I WATCHED THE STREAM
Watched this live on Lannan's channel and it was hilarious! Awesome vid Lachy!! ❤️❤️
10:47 anybody see in the chat mo salah
Hi
Bro gave lannan more kills in the thumbnail 💀
W
Like this comment
It’s a custom
It aint a world record if it just streamsnipers
My squad got 64 kills between us yesterday...
but this doesn't count lol. like your first 30 kills were just people letting you kill them
how do you have the little things that tell what sounds there are around your crosshair
I LOVE THIS VID
That’s crazy to have 81 kills out of 100 players
lame vid can't lie
I always use your code
in the intro is that not 64 kills?
I Fr just watched the other video this morning
i dont understand why he made a second Chanel when this Chanel and the main one has the same content? like why not just upload more on the main Chanel?   can someone explain
Bro you guys will never find out how many likes this will get😂
bro its a scuffed game all from their discord
I watched the older video about a week ago and seeing this thumbnail hit
Don't translate!  နာရီအနည်းငယ်ကြာတဲ့အခါ သင့်နှလုံးခုန်ရပ် သွားပါလိမ့်မယ်။ ၎င်းကိုတားဆီးရန် တစ်ခု တည်းသောနည်းလမ်းမှာ ကျွန်ုပ်၏ချန်နယ်သို့ စာရင်းသွင်းရန်ဖြစ်သည်။
yall needa get lazerbeam in PWR asap
Lacey saying lazarbeam has a small Chanel but lazar has more subs😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
if this counts as a kill record than nick eh 30 have hundreds of them
Imagine if this was ranked
yeah but wr with stream snipers is kinda bs
81 for the mamba
Not really the same when the lobby is filled with stream snipers so it’s obviously gonna get beat
The lowkey lazarbeam roast in the beginning 😭
Of course LazarBeam has the least kills lol
Day 13 of trying to get Lachlan to add me
Lacy
Wow breaking the record by killing AI
👇people who love OG fortnite
Saw this live
Yo andrew1107 was there
The fact that Lachy called that it was gonna be a kill record💀
People who had watched his stream 👇
I had a record with my squad and I had 78 kills just a month ago 😭
The lachy skin still hasnt seen chapter 1 map
Why does the kill record keep getting broken
How does he get Those speciel things when he hits people
My friend dropped a 52 bomb with 34 kills
Look the OG Pit is great and all, except everyone and their nan just boogy spams you then boxes and traps you...
I watched it live, it was awesome.
Doesn’t matter how you did it, 81 is amazing regardless tbh. 2 fingers for Kobe Bryant’s 81
Why can't believe this comment Has so. Many likes? And also fortnite is amazing  Good job. 👍 👏
8:40 why... why the combat
jueb
71kills btw😂😂
I liked my own comment.                  Play my fortnite map! Code is 3006-9040-4270!
I think looter is the best❤
Content: Fortnite  Viewership: 30 million  Stonks
I got 62 in a duo
thought the kill record was either 81 or 78 in a low level tournament with 4 pros
I thought My 70 was good
Is Alex fresh? They sound the same.
😂😂😂😂 not a legit world record. Stream snipers working with ya is like doing steroids in bodybuilding or bike racing.  BS record 🧢🧢🧢
i rewatched that video earlier today
😂😅😅😅😅😅
Remember when he didn’t even know what a 90 was
Hi
Lazarbeam was trynna say spawn kills lol
Me my brother and my friend got 68 as a trio
Minecraft reference was amazing
W
The most I’ve gotten is 77 in a trio squads match
No mrsavage clix and mongraal got 85 on EU
I just watch the old video today 😂
Oce servers
Bro got a gold fragile and gold combat and just didn’t say anything
🎵He's playing “Jort storm”  by Charlie Slimecicle at 3:37 🤣
Cap, they did what x2 twins did! Watch a video come out saying we faked a world record!
I can't believe I already seen this in lazarbeam's stream
Love your video Lachlan and keep up the great work
Bro said Lazarbeam is a small channel 🤨
Hi

Nax that all was free kills

From 2024
Why is the title spectating a hacker when you were spectating him for 10 seconds and he wasn’t even cheating haha
