I never even saw them, but I always wanted to try the hot dogs from the spot where all the biker gangs and meth dealers would hang out
Do a pimento cheese sandwich.
"potato-mushroom-based prank"
" *Babish* ,Are you done cooking the chicken."
Pollos hermanos chicken skin looks alot darker then this chicken
Has anyone figured out the measurements from metric to US measurements?
Gus is already a successful man how much more did he need
0:55 will it blend reference 🙌🏻
I caught that will it blend tip of the hat and now i feel old
I don´t like it
Anyone else think the fries were spaghetti in the thumbnail?
I like the Will It Blend reference
Haha a line from Blendtech blenders "Don't breathe this" 😂
This video gave me an acid flashback
Sorry. Chicken looks raw on the inside.
I get it's a laundering scheme and all, but Los Pollos Hermanos could legitimately make them a lot of money too.
Ah yes, a cup of French.
That Chili P is tight yo!
How does this recipe work for only chicken legs
POLLOS
Me: How do you make a product based on its commercial?  The commercial: "All improved with love and care" Me: Well.. _unzip_ I guess it's an experimental mixture.
0:30 A reference to the German CEO scene?
Don't breathe this <3
Back when his content wasn't slop
Petition for him to do the cinabuns from Better Call Saul next :
Got an ad for KFC before this, ironic
Some baking powder in the batter will help
Daily thumbnail change
Why does this guy always have to put alcohol in everything?
why did you change the thumbnails the old ones were much much better
def up to pollos standards
Church's chicken uses batter I think. They look very similar.

used to be a takeaway near me that did their chicken wings in batter like that instead of using sauces or anything, i need to try this recipe bc i swear those wings were incredible
Honestly? I GOT to make that sort of chicken.
I got a ticket for a chicken quesadilla with no cheese…I still think about this when I can’t sleep at night
this was my first cooking video i watched ever and ever since then i’ve fallen in love with cooking to the point i went to open my own restaurant in my city 3 years ago and now my restaurant has been flourishing ever since, it’s one of the best in the country with many great chefs that work in it from around the world. this was all a lie
highly doubt in real life the batter would be that spiceless...   if you have ever made fried chicken,  you need a lot of flavor in the flour otherwise it just tastes bland and awful..
It is... acceptable
$3 Million for 3 months of your time.  Extended annually call it 12, Open Ended. 😐
Bro the will it blend reference!
I want some
Seeing the bogus Los Pollos Hermanos commercial reminds me of the fake SNL commercial for a fried chicken fast food restaurant featuring a decapitated, blood dripping talking chicken head cartoon character. Turtle soup would be fitting for Tortuga.
How can chicken go from raw to safe to eat in only 7-10 minutes?
these fries look like pig tails
I wonder what’s with all the thumbnail changes
"It is...acceptable."
4:22 very dangerous and very VERY painful
You made it better than the actual one ong
0:55  In chemistry, you’re supposed to waft the scent to your nose with your hand Have you learned nothing from my chemistry class?
Não entendi nada
You didn't incubate an egg, and raise it to maturity, and harvest its meat. This is NOT from scratch.  This is to assume you stole an egg from a farm.
Hello. My name is Gustavo Fring. But you can call me Gus. 😃
Could you airfry this
love how in a breaking bad episode Andy managed to use a chemical weapon on himself (aerosolized capsaicin is the "pepper" in pepper spray)
He's just making fried chicken and curly fries. Then he slaps 'Breaking Bad' on the title with a picture of Walter.
Why didn't you use a whole chicken and deep fried that?
I had to finish Breaking Bad first before I watch this video
I found this instructional video to be… satisfactory
It probably is just me but when people talk on video, nearly full frame up to their neck but without their face for more than 5 seconds it is unsettling, almost creepy.
soundtack selection sucks on this one, maybe its to loud
Got to have the batter. That’s how we move our “product”.
Fring fry fro from...
This guy is a hack and a fraud
wait is that actually Giancarlo Esposito doing the narration in the ad??
Don't trust anyone with their own brand of cooking ware.
Gus fring is such a nice dude, I hope nothing happens to him!
Deep fry the potato mushroom .
3:40 “I’m also going to add a little bit of salt” *proceeds to to sprinkle at least 8g of salt*
Do you find them acceptable?
next episode: how to make heisenberg's ricin
Funny enough, where I used to work, we straight up just double-battered the chicken before frying it with just the flour mixture. No liquid involved.  Just coat the chicken in the batter, refrigerate it for like a day, throw it in the batter again, into vegetable? oil at 325 for 14:30. Of course we were frying like 48 pieces at a time so we needed longer so you could probably get away with like 10 minutes at home.  Frying isn’t scary. Trust me. You just have to place your chicken in the oil and it’ll do its thing from there. Basically break the surface tension
To anyone reliant on subtitles: The only time he actually says "French" is near the beginning when he says "French and Ranch Dressing". In all other instances, he is saying "Franch."
can you make foods from malcolm in the middle?
"What does family taste like? In your heart you know it's the best ingredients..." I'll be remembering that when I make homemade sausage for my family reunion.
I've always find odd that Gus is Chilean by the simple fact that... Chile doesn't have black population. All black people in Chile are inmigrants from Haiti, Colombia and Venezuela
That Blendtec reference took me back, mate
Binging with Babish: Blue methamphetamine.
Not me getting a Babish ad before this
Someone cooked here
yes
Pollos should have real life restaurants like bubba gump
Customer: “I don’t like the curly fries, can I get my money back?” Gus, while taking out a plastic bag and some zipties: “If you’ll just follow me into my office for a moment.”
"don't breath this" If you know, you know.
babish likes his chicken drippy bruh
this is when babish became babishberg
This is upto Pollos standards
Babish: We dont want the curly fried too long   Me: Speak for yourself, thanks.
Real Quick its Chill-eean not Chill-ayan
My wife is going to hate me when she sees that I just randomly purchased a bunch of material to try and mirror this recipe/episode.
that last shot was sick
I wish they still made videos like this with this music. Nostalgic for me

Here's what I don't understand, why didn't Gus just...make chicken?
Fun Fact: Los Pollos Hermanos is Spanish for The Chicken Brothers
Manley Canyon
Not calling this episode “Breaking with Badish” was a missed opportunity
Bell ringing slows, for now
Man..this channel doesn't even  share the other spices ingredients @1:00 Am unsubscribing
according to the los Pollo Hermanos training video on sustainability they use soy and corn vegetable oil not peanut oil.
That chicken looks blend to me
I can't be the only one who is Franch  was a real thing I would probably have a gallon of that in my refrigerator at all times

You are so Lyle-pilled, Andrew.
they make deep fryers for home use too
If I eat that once I survive but if I eat it regularly I could die!
When the official Breaking Bad channel approves, you know Babish is up to Pollos standards.
Why does this guy always use baking sheet that he rims? Over here always saying “set in a rimmed baking sheet”, why you gotta rim them all bro? 😭
Will it blend reference?
Just remember, you're not in Chile anymore.
someone cooked here...
No blue salt?
Chicken looks like it could use a 2nd fry to get the brown color and more crisp.
BREAKING with BADish
*Walter white has left the chat*
I know I'm coming in here years after the fact but I just watched this video and I loved the homage to " will it blend?"
"The Spiciest Spices" Yeah Right-   Indian Spice Boy
Taste the Family
What makes me happy is the fact that the man making this meal is bald, just like the best breaking bad characters.
Curly fries rule!!
Yk i used to work in a batter fried chicken place and usually it goes flour batter flour
Sooo this is going to sound a bit weird but why do you use Imperial measurements on some videos but then switch to metric in others and sometimes alternate between both of them in the same video? I just always thought it was fascinating when you suddenly switch from like cups to grams
0/10 no cajun kickass to compliment the spice curls
Lalo: "Is there any chance that i could meet the owner?"
Not often you hear the word "betwixt" utilized in a video. Excellent recipe as usual.
There’s only one thing I remember being cooked on BB
I didnt actually know the spice mix was Chilean, nice lttle touch from the show!
It is… acceptable.
I thought it said "Breaking with Babish" for a sec
you had me at mother Arby's
in another commercial (in season 3 episode 9) it shows rotisserie chicken then deep fried
I'll have to try the fry batter on my homemade fries.  The chicken did not look spicy though.  I love Popeye's chicken because when they first opened in NOLA the cayenne pepper got under the skin, resulting in a spicier chicken.  Outside of New Orleans it seems bland, not spicy at all.  That being said, I'm going to try this.  I'll put some rub under the skin as well.
Is there any foods from the cartoon recess? I used to love that show as a kid
The potential of a mess is not a legitimate excuse to dismiss the method.
Why did he change the thumbnail
It’s 98% pure..
Yo you’re cooking it has been a sin compared to mine
I just got a babish ad on this video
It looks like rare
It is, acceptable.
i keep undercooked my chicken, how did i do wrong?
My name is gustavo in real life, I approve of this
Love the Will It Blend? reference!
Dont breath this... but will it blend? That is the question
Das war sehr informativ
:]❤
I got an ad from this channel right before actually watching the vid 😭
Does anyone else notice that they are going back and editing the thumbnails of the videos. I’m here for it.
why are all the thumbnails being changed to 2k subscriber level thumbnail
Potato mushroom
sometimes i forget the pollos hermanos ad is from a show about a bald guy with cancer making dr*gs.
missed opportunity to call this breaking with babish
"chili pepper smoke: don't breathe this!" Was that a Will It Blend reference I caught? I loved that series from back in the day.
Your ingredient is missing phenylacetic acid. I usually get that from the bee barrels.
I need to see your bawls
It is... acceptable.
CHILE MENTIONED 🇨🇱
I think the thumbnail changed.
Why are Pollos adds better than the actual fast food adds?
Really cool chicken
nice video
I just got an ad from babish before this video I was like huhhhh
Breaking with Badbish
I love that the only initial direction Giancarlo (sic?) was given in his characterisation of Gus Fring was that "he's a nice man who sells chicken" and he decided to give the role an understated menace which persuaded them to develop the character further.
:Spoiler alert the ingredient is m*th
The fried chicken and curly fries were...acceptable
>grams  Stopped watching right there.
Not. Enough. SEASONING!!!
It seems it blends
waltuh if he didn't had cancer
Leave it to breaking bad to make you crave food from a restaurant that doesn’t exist
I love how he spatchcock a chicken even though you was going to fry it that is real culinary etiquette
Most important ingredient? That kosher salt of course.
The background music reminded me of yellow
Incredible recipe. The breading traps the juice inside so it explodes on the first bitw
Deep frying in a Dutch oven is safer and works great.
did the Thumbnail change
Babis u really indeed look like walter white!
Oh yes tempura the thick batter 😅
Betwixt. 😊
Breaking babish.
whats with the thumbnail?
Bro, when I click out this video, there’s a breaking bad ad that had binging with Babbish in it
Bro I got your own ad before this video!!crazy
What’s with the THUMBNAILS? The older videos are changing
A "Will it Blend?" reference
Was the bleep always there?
NO WAY THIS VIDEO GOT A SEAL OF APPROVAL FROM GUS FRING
I would definitely make a batch of those curly fries without cutting them! French fry snakes! 😛
I made these today and it is just like it was described by Lalo. I simply love it. This should be sold on the streets I think. The seasoning mix is so flavorful I couldn't stop to smell it over and over again even the raw chicken smelled lovely. My family already told me to make it again. I really recommend to try this recipe out! You can not ruin it if you follow the recipe ;) The batter was not so fragile as I thought it would be based on the 'cons'. Just let it fry for a few minutes before gently turning them around.
Instructions unclear, used treif salt
Thumbnail gone on 4 videos now
Funny enough, Lalo described the chicken almost exactly as you did: "Crispy, but not dried out!"
I think it was the Peruvian recipe instead of the Chilean recipe.
Babish touched my hoohaa
Can this chicken be made in air frier?
That chicken is so crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside!!!! I need it!!
the chicken brothers
life cxhanging keep it up alvin

Do deluxe peanut chicken from phineas and ferb
Ad:"what does family taste like?" Canibals:"oh, I know this one! "
If Hector Salamanca shows up, just let him eat your curly fries. Thank you.
First bite is all yours'!
What does family taste like?  Ask a cannibal
Babish knows arby’s is *peak* fast food
i've got ip grabbed..
I got a scotch whiskey ad made by babish when I clicked on this 😂
Ur missing the met-
i know for sure someone is pronouncing this as 'polos her main ohs'
looks like boiled chicken covered in a crust.. idk bout that one
"Four to twenty four hours." What
I tried it, the chicken was crispy, but it wasn't dried out.
Breaking Babish
I wonder if salting the boiling water and allowing the potatoes to sit for a while might firm them up before frying.
I think Babish should try making that blue candy next. People would pay hundreds for that.
niezle polecam
„What does the Family taste like?”  I dont know sir I only did your daughter 🫡  „Buuuuut….”
i approve
I wish you cooked something else...
Im waiting for the roof pizza video.
why is the closing shot the chicken nutting
kid named finger
Does using your hand to put salt in make the salt better, somehow?  I don't understand, why not just pour it in...
It has a weird blue flavor
I don’t know why but I just started thinking about chicken curly fries
Would you consider franchising?
Chicken looks 10/10,  Curly fries 2/10
4:29 "2 to 5 minutes." That's a rather wide range.
Babish is up to Los Pollos Hermanos standards
0:09: "Always delivered with a friendly smile" ;)...
Casually flexing his Rolex while making Los Pollos Hermanos fried chicken lol
Only fckin thing left now is An Actual Los Pollos Hermanos Fast food outlet to open up lol ( YK it’s happening lol ) ⚡️⚡️🌊⚡️⚡️
Gus : It is....acceptable.
So basically I should get all my antics out before I attempt this recipe?
Love the blendtec, “Will it blend?” Easter egg
Gotta appreciate Giancarlo's acting in the 'commercial' being so awkward and just like an uncaring businessman PRETENDING he really cares.
Can you imagine the pollos Hermanos joining in on the chicken sandwich wars
：「：：「：
Wait are we cooking the brothers or the chicken?
Eww. That looked bad. Dropping fluid from chicken. 🤢
as a girl from Albuquerque where they shot "Breaking Bad" Los pollos hermanos is actually a twister in the city of lakeview
That looks tight tight
If you followed Walter’s recipe the chicken would be blue
Gus would be so proud of this. I hear he's a real blast to hang out with!
I know the answer is probably no,but is it possible for me to meet the owner🤤
Now all he needs in that chicken is some of Walt's crystal
chicken is fried becus chicken idk what img jg
Gus does not like competition....
that chicken be using them 99.1% blue flour
In the show it looks much more brown and KFC like. This is more appealing
Pollos hermanos is inspired on mexican style chicken chains like pollo loco and pollo feliz, they are not like kfc look them up they are differently cooked
Lol I thought I was watching an unskipable ad for a sec there in the beginning
Now i want Gustavo Fring taste it
Where is the salsa?!
0:02 dude the middle is part of the breaking bad universe
betwixt
It looks great but is it really up to the pollos standard? 🤔
Binging bad
So beautiful 😮!!
so this chicken was sourced from chan chich?
This is… acceptable
Hello we are delighted to hear that you like the recipe.
with the curly fries, los pollos hermanos is the Arby's we never got.
I marinate my chicken  in buttermilk  and then coat it in the seasoned flour
The Blendtec reference at 0:56 😂
If gus wasnt a drug lord he would probably be the nicest person ever
I caught the blendtec reference. I see you too are a man of culture
long fries are fun
It is acceptable

Im subscribing specifically because of  the "Will It Blend" reference. Thank you for making my week.
"What does family taste like?"  Chicken. It's probably chicken.
took a couple years, but you delivered the tater tots episode.  :)
I always have to boiled the chicken first because when I fry it without cooking it first, the chicken always came out cooked outside but raw inside. Any tips guys ?
I come for the awesome recipe but stay for the wire rack sat in a rimmed baking sheet.
Make a chicken sandwich out of this no balls
_We don’t want anything too thick like a tempura._  Never thought I’d hear tempura batter be called _”thick”._

Watching this during ramadan🥲

My guy, you're a cooking channel AND you eat at Arby's?! What in the world...
potato mushroom type pranks are the only funny thing for me anymore
I can’t help but like Gus in this advert. He seems so nice
powderize.  so you made it in your spice powderizer?
Instruction unclear, I end up making some blue crystal.   oh, nevermind, it taste really TIGHT!
Americans loves everything swimming in oil
...why does no one make potato mushroom fries I feel like that should be a thing after seeing this. The stem part would probably be crispy and the top possibly airy and soft a fry you can share
.
'Make sure everyone is submerged'  Love this
This chicken is 99.3% pure
Imagine if there was a restaurant where all the cooks were babishes
Gotta appreciate the ‘will it blend’ reference
Babish embrace the refreshing shower of peace and love and denounce Rowling's torrent of sewage! NO TO PERSECUTION!
is it crispy but not dried out?
different type of breaking bad cooking
Gas station thing
Nostalgia taste
Imma try this but with a milk butter brine with the added spices
Serious question: Why use weight based units of measurement in cooking as opposed to volume based?
Jesse, we need to eat
Breaking Babish
please move captions to the top cuz we cant see the food and have captions on
Breaking babish!?!!???!???!??!????!??!?
What does Family taste like? Hm I dont know man, thats kinda a lot of meat for one person
It is... acceptable.
This is… acceptable
such a sad missed opportunity to put 'breaking bad with babish'
There’s nothing Chilean about those spices dude
Gus makes the best fried chicken and fries
do something from the secret menu next
“Yo！These are the bomb!”
It. Is. Acceptable
Breaking bad with babish
You look like walter Babish!
The skin of the chicken won't be fried this way. It becomes a layer of fatty grease under the crispy batter. Disgusting when the chicken gets colder.
say his name. or you can just call him gus, he said it himself
I watched this on my last day of school
You gotta love the nod to ‘Will it blend’ if you know, you know.
Diet coke please.... And five minutes of your time....
babish sounds like the youtuber "north of the border"
Potato mushroom! :D

They are real now! Hopefully comes with that blue stuff
nice video
next video on hannibal pls
there really was a tater tots episode
Lyle has been silence these days after this video came out. I wonder why 🤔
I've become obsessed with texting people "POLLOS" with no context.
I know its a lot to ask but could i speak to the owner
Nobody's mentioning the Blendtech reference and it's a crime
Don't breathe this
I want a bite 😢
S P I C E     C U R L S
From 2 years in the future. He did the tatertots episode and the Cajun Kickass sauce is, in fact, Kickass.
I can understand grinding up red pepper flakes. They’re largely seeds and I hate biting down on whole pepper seeds…
Is this what Jacking a Juicy with Babbish means
One thing that I want yo say is "kosher salt". Thanks for your attention...
“What does family taste like?” Got my head snapping, i think ive heard that on pornhub
You found peppers in Aleppo? The folks there don't even have homes anymore!
Can’t believe it took 2 years to finally get the tater tots episode
My middle name is sputtering scary mess.
Kosher salt? Unsubbed
I never thought  batter fried was so rare lol I've had flour coated fried chicken but the battered method keeps the chicken juicy, adds a bunch of flavor and crisp prime examples Popeyes, and Roasters fried chicken 😋👍👍
“Tempoora” *my soul has left the chat*    Edit: no hate tho w cooking skills my guy.
This is a certified Los Pollos Hermanos moment
is there a non alcoholic version?

Could you use an airfryer instead of deep frying them?

Fried chicken is my "Death Row" meal.
I wish there were real franchises of tLos Pollos Hermanos fried chicken somewhere on this planet
Los Pollos makes better chicken than KFC needs more credit
"deepfying at home scares me"  *laughs in Belgian*
I loved the Will it Blend reference, don't breathe this!
💚💚💚❤️💗💗💗💗💛💛
Can the potatoes and chicken be air-fried?
Imagine if Gus just realized he would be better off just staying in the restaurant business rather than using it as a front
I like your  reactions when you make  mistakes. Very human from you 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
ITS LIKE BREAKING BAD
nice reference to the will it blend “don’t breathe this” 😂
Try the seasoned curly fries.
Approved by Sus Fring
The proper grammar is “he was Frung” for instance “the country from which he was Frung”

Binging with babish
He looks like Walter white
Where the metafemin? 😊
4:20 any Asian mom would not care
This is where Binging became Babish

"Hello, welcome to the Los Pollos Hermanos family, my name is Gustavo, but you can call me Gus"
I am the one who subscribed.
For a moment i tougth this was a How to basic video for no reason.

"Sir  theres no blue crystal on my chicken😡"
That is the best chicken I have ever had. It's crispy, but its not dried out and, the seasoning... its so... Flavourful.
Ah, my favorite mushroom, a potato
This is up to the Pollos’ standard
Y’all remember when this video first came out and Andrew accidentally left the entirety of the los pollos hermanos audio playing talking over him for like have the video
as a Gustavo, this is a certified Gus moment
This is up to pollos standards
Where is the blue stuff? Not approved
Love the old classic blendtec reference lol
I got an actual Binging sigh Babish ad and thought it was part of the video.
Why would you put your hand under the chicken to stop the juice when there was a plate right under there??
You forgot the blue ingredient
It is...acceptable.

I had a add with u in it in the beginning
Wholesome
It is, acceptable.
Wow!! This is amazing. I've reached season 5 and am dreading the day it's going to end.  Gus was amazing, as an actor, every single person in the cast is so amazing. Really going to miss the serial.
Yes but is your kitchen clean enough for this? Unacceptable
Kim never ate Los Pollos before
Nice
Well done! Can’t wait for the amphetamine cooking video!

Wonder how Walter got the recipe
Put the blues on it now
Nothing unusual about any of this.
That's... A LOT of spice's.
Any non alcoholic substitute for the batter?
Man, Walter's cooking for Gus now?     But fr tho, anyone who's bald and has that beard is canonically Waltuh.
It would be cool if Pollos hermanos was a real restaurant. Babish kind of looks like Walter White.
that's 99.1 chicken
I love the Will it Blend reference
Can I airfry them potatos?
walter white after killing gus:
This is up the Los Pollos Hermanos standards
Cooking bad
The people that don’t know 😀 The people who know 💀
around a year ago my mom said "what's binging and babish" and said "binging" like bing as in the website lol
I'm hungry now
Can I have a link to where I can buy that spiralizer?
Our next episode: recreating Frings 99.1% pure methanphedamine
you had me sold at the Will It Blend reference
Babish: Scared of touching hot oil Philippinoes: Touching boiling oil with bare fingers
Wow, the hit show “cooking with finger” really has taught me so much
I’ve been tryna find a recipe on this and then I thought babish would do this  I’m gonna try this
This is my favorite bwb episode. I always come back to watch it
You forgot the chilly p
no.
It’s missing the blue spice.
You are really putting alcohol in a kids chicken meal...
3:32
This is definetly up to Pollos Standards
He should have said “IM THE ONE WHO COOKS”
Bro looks like he would star in far cry 6 as a villain 😂
His pfp looks like Walter white
Careful, Gus will force you to work for him!
Breaking Bab
It’s not juicy it is juice
This is... acceptable.
This video is sponsored by Arbys
I love their rock salt that they put on the sauces secretly for some reason.

This is up to pollos standards
"How to become a drug kingpin" next please
Everybody gangsta until you realize that Gus is a drug dealer
I love binging these with absolutely nill intentions of doing them
Why haven't you done Gus's home cooked meal he made for Walt and Jesse when he invited them to his home yet? Lol I would be very interested in what would turn out.
welcome to the los pollos hermanos family!
Your telling me family taste like smiles and spices?
No offense,but I'm not even a fan of this show,why forcing me to watch this,YouTube?
I’m the type of guy that stops watching a cooking video because it uses something that I’m allergic to
So Lalo's description of the chicken being crispy but not dried out is accurate.
Vamos chileeeeee wnnn
not the right chicken            spoiler              they use met-
I think you forgot something
This is to Pollos standards
Buen video la receta se ve rica y mas la de los Churrumais aunque te falto la receta de la meta.
Imagine buying Los Pollos Hermanos for lunch after using a drug that you got from Gus' dealers
"Then I press everyone down into the boiling water and make shure everyone is submerged" I am calling the police
Cool
it is acceptable
i feel like something is missing.
I can't believe I know what Los Pollos Hermanos was last year.
Gus Fring:"How does family taste like?" Me:"First chop up some relatives"
i hope youre not a secretly drug dealer who deals with the most dangerous guy in the world
nice video benjamin!

Gus isn't originally from Chile. He studied there but wasn't born and brought up there.
what a friendly kind man it would be a shame if he turned out to be a ruthless drug lord
Breaking Babis
Binging Bad
Gus Fring: IT IS... ACCEPTABLE...
Can we just take a moment to appreciate how perfect the drumstick in the thumbnail looks
UM...Los Pollos Hermanos uses soy-corn vegetable oil for their frying.  Immersion ruined.  Unsubscribed.
Can you make Methamphetamine? It's a Breaking Bad reference!
They sure give KFC a run for their money
Isn’t it from better call Saul

What about Tuco's Burritos?
This does meet Pollos standards.
You should make Tucos burrito from breaking bad
gus frings bootycheeks lookin quite breedable today 😋
So no ones gon talk about how this video tells us how to do los pollos hermanos chicken and he has freaking walter white as his pfp?
I tried the chicken, it’s great. The chicken *explodes* with flavor once I bite it!
A real explosion of flavor!
Breaking with babish
I find this fried chicken to be... ...acceptable.
It’s literally gold chichen
"It's crispy, but it's not dried out, and the seasoning is so ... flavorful!"
Breaking babish
i wish that fast food restaurant really really exist
Who else got really in the mood for spicier foods but just wanted to see the end results so they watch the video
We need a spin off all about Gus and los pollos
why it kinda look like a squeaky toy
Babish: "how was the chicken?" Fring: *stares* "It was acceptable.  You may go home now."
Gus dies
Sebby! Sebby! They made the breaking bad chicken in real life sebby! (Only rtgame fans will know what this references
You also need a special spice only obtainable through a chermistry teacher at alberquerque.
batter fried french fries are diarrhea
Thanks for the video - I've never seen the spiralizer before.    Can you get a different attachment for that same kitchenade that makes thicker ones or adjust the one you have to make them thicker?
This is definitely up to Pollos standards.
“Hello, and welcome to the Los Pollos Hermanos family. My name is Gustavo, but you can call me sus-“
Dude that chicken looked like one of those rubber chicken toys
Great video... ty.. Best video!  I see so many and don't watch bc they describe every little thing turning 3 mins of content into 20 mins... like this review.  My point! Lol
I live in albuquerque new mexico-
Chicken brothers..
That chicken looks so terrible
Fun fact. The original fried chicken The early Scots settlers brought with them to North America was batter fried.
KNUCKS
It is.... Acceptable.
Still waiting on that potato-mushroom-based prank video..

There is something else you can make from Breaking Bad...even more iconic...
This is..... acceptable.
Literally just making stuff up as he goes.
I didn’t know that the Dentist from PAYDAY 2 ran a fast food chain
That guy in the clips seems like a nice non drug lord type of guy
How about another recipe from breaking bad? I heard there is another quality one but i dunno the food is.
Your attempt of Pollos hermanos chicken is acceptable
Clever, clever chicken man.
Started the video looking away from the screenand was ready to skip the ad when I realized that it was apart off it..

welcome to the los pollos hermanos family
Arby’s does have underrated fries
3:15 when i heard manscaping i skipped like 30 seconds ahead because i thought it was an ad lol
I was really waiting for ...."and just a touch of freshly ground blue methamphetamine" in every ingredient list
straight into the action zamn
"don't breathe it in, it hurts your lungs." *takes a huge hit off the spice blend*
You forgot the m- nevermind
walter, you are supposed to do a different type of cooking
NO I WANT THAT
Even the ads of the BB universe are sociopathic
It is.............acceptable
Gus didn’t deserve to die 🥲
"Don't breathe this".... is that a reference to the Blendtec Will It Blend series?
Nah bro family tastes like some seawater punching bag fruit rollups with a side of ham.
Shoulda named this one "breaking with babish"
Yummy
JESSE WE NEED TO REMAKE THIS
Babish is definitely up to Pollos Hermanos standards
maybe you should do walts recipe?
up to pollo standards
GET THE BLUES JESSE
Gustavo Fring would like your location
This is the moment the potatoes and chicken become a large curly fry and 3 piece combo from Los Pollos Hermanos.
Didn’t Gus say in the commercial that the chicken was “slow cooked to perfection”?
I will always read this as bingging with bobbish
Come try our chicken, I'm not asking this time.
dont breathe this vacuum channel is a throwback
Now make the blue candy
You'd think a professional YouTube channel ahem sorry cooking channel would have a better frying setup that wouldnt be so scary.
Now do veggie bacon
Anyone else come here and watch this after each episode of Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul that features the restaurant in the episode.
It’s been almost two years…where is the tater tot episode? Huh Babish? Where is it?!
Hello, and welcome to the Los Pollos Hermanos family, my name is Gustavo, but you can call me Gus
3:00 Imma let it sit for fifteen minutes (holds up 15 fingers)
Better call saul better
HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE LOS POLLOS HERMANOS FAMILY MY NAME IS GUSTAVO BUT YOU CAN CALL ME SUS
Is polo like a type of fried chicken?
Los Pollos Hermanos is supposed to be Michoacan culinary, isn't it? Or is it Chilean? I don't think it's Chilean because I don't see excess mayo in the films.
The curly fries look like speggeti
chiken was too joosy
This is acceptable
Jesse, we need to try the new "Babish Culinary Universe" Pollos Hermanos chicken wings!
walt you aren’t fooling me
Breaking with babish
That is a terrific looking meal, might just be the best looking fried chicken I've ever seen
This chicken recipe is most definitely up to Pollos Standards 👍
So... Chicken Brothers?
Hey love the content    btw   this food is  referenced  and featured in player unknowns  battlegrounds  map and a jt music song 4 loco btw that is alcoholic drink  but is the pubg  mianmar Mexico    map  in the game   I forget where
Cooking bad
"This is acceptable. You can go home now."
Gus is great
Nice hair
but were you up to pollos standards?
But is this up to pollos standards?
Wow did he just make a "will it blend" reference?
Man, I shouldn't watch these while hungry...
Proof?
Needed wayyyyyy more dry rub on the chicken. Why so selfish? And chicken needed longer in the oil, needed to be more golden and not that moist inside.
Gus: You are up to Pollos Hermanos standards.
"Hello. And welcom to the los pollos hermanos family. My name is gustavo, but you can call me Sus."
I feel like this would taste like chicken from Pollo Campero
how is that not in the clean plate club it looks insanely delicious
Gus Fring wants to Hire you.
It's bingeing, not binging
He is well up to pollos standarts
Didn't they have buckets of pre-made batter?
Nobody talks about the chemical weapon that is pepper smoke
Watching this again really makes me want some fried chicken right now...
Would it not be easier to put the chicken in a bowl, then Massage in the seasoning and only after that place it on the rack?
as a native spanish speaker the way he said pollos hermanos made me throw up in my mouth
Missed opportunity to title the video "Breaking Babish"
1:08 Is that rally salt? 🤨
stop with the insecure/self deprecating commentary about yourself. Literally NO ONE is thinking that your bite is "embarrassing" or anything of the sort. Its literally just you thinking that. We all think your great, but your negative comments about yourself bring the videos experience down a peg. Come on bro, you are cool and you should know it!!!!!!!!!
Does it include .0001% blue crystal?
'hot frying oil is very dangerous' especially with a gas stove!
This guy is up to pollo standards
When are you going to mimic the Chilean stew Gustavo made with Walter.
why do I imagine johnny sins behind the camera?
Kid named finger
this is the moment andrew became babish.
There are 14 locations, so yes. It's a full-time job.
Now i want some Los Pollos Hermanos fried chicken with some spicy sauce
Everyone in the comment section is making Breaking Bad jokes but i definitely wasn't expecting a Will It Blend reference in this video
nice video.
He forgot the lemon zest , Don yuan says it’s sooo zesty
im gustavo but you can call me s u s
It is acceptable
I am vegan why am I watching this
My reaction to that information
Babish: "That's great and all but we can go deeper: So, we configure the chicken genome..."
What makes this Pollos Hermanos? Because you said so? Meh.
The dry-ness of your delivery just slays me, sometimes.
Binging with BAbish
does anyone know what the song that sounds like plucking strings in the background are at the beginning.
Babish needs an assistant named jesse
who was that in the reflection of the of the shiny oven at exactly 1:43
Fry these potato mushrooms! They look🔥🔥🔥
"and if you dont! I will find you."
You've been called out Babitch, Erik is going to destroy you in the ring
HE’S CALLING YOU OUT BABITCH
“One punch man” Babish vs. “Currently eating cat food” Erik!!
Big Money vs BB!
Babish v. Salvia…I can smell it from here
You’ve been challenged Benjamin Babish!!
This is up to pollo standards
Is it just me or do i really feel hungry with your vids like the los pollos, ribwich, etc.
Looks like a fine establishment, I might give it a try.
So glad to see that Babish is up to Pollos Standards.
0:55 nice nod to Will It Blend?
Time to wear my Los Pollos T-Shirt! :D love this!
It is unfortunate that he died.           btw I had nothing to do with it
This confirms that Babish is up to Pollos standards!
my reaction to seeing gus still alive somehow:
did he say arbys?
Definitely not Chilean spices
Nice
who does the voice over ?
Gus: walt, how did you know my secret recipe?
Fun fact: you have a higher chance of eating the potato mushroom than a random one.
Not up to Pollo standards
@Babish Culinary Universe Someday will you make a video on your frying vessel choices? I've seen the dutch oven, the cast iron skillet, and recently with @J. Kenji López-Alt the wok. I'm not sure when to use which vessel. Thanks!
I'm going to give you a little hint or not supposed to inhale anything that's been blended into dust
You're a goof
It is....acceptable
I hope babish doesn't work with junkies
Where did you get the recipe?
I know a chicken place up near Nevada called "Las Dos Hermanos."  And I should probably not mention any more than that if I don't wanna find out that they're cooking something besides chicken.
It is acceptable.
"...But will it blend?"
Brothers chicken weird name I know this because I took a Spanish class
Best chips I’ve ever made
Haven't heard a Will It Blend reference in a hot second. Wonder if hes still blending?
The most important question: Are those paper towels Bounty paper towels??
i thought the beginning was an ad
my name is gustavo, but you can call me SUS  DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN
I'm sorry, how TF do you "generously sprinkle" anything? It sounds not far removed from jumbo shrimp and (Russian) military intelligence to me XD
So, I'm gonna kinda be 'that guy'. I'm a native New Mexican and Los Pollos Hermanos is filmed at Twister's. Which is a local Mexican fast food chain, mainly specializing in Burritos. The signature curly fries are nothing like Arby's fries. No batter or seasoning, just regular fries, but curly. Haha. Just don't wanna get anyone's hopes up who tries them and they're nothing like this.
A year and a half later and still no tater tots episode...
Gus Fring: it is.. acceptable.
Not up to Pollos standards
You are really scared of deep frying oil huh?
It is *acceptable* .
this is not what I call "fast food" but still amazing to watch
Could you imagine watching this and not knowing what breaking bad even is and hearing 2:05
This “Gus Fring” fellow seems rather nice, I’m sure he produces fine and… pure… chicken
You seem to think we are a superhero company. What we are is a fried chicken company
Glad I'm not the only one who gets nervous frying stuff in pans.
Wheres the tator tots episode?!
yum
All prepare with love and a bit of methamphetamine.
This chicken makes you see colors
I like the fried chicken tho :D
7/10: Not enough Franch™
This video got me into Breaking Bad
The way he said "Again" at 1:12 was *click** _"Noice"_
I'm not religious but sweet baby Jesus those curly fries look heavenly
If you don't got any N-methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine then you can substitute it with some D-methylphetamine    or even some D-aphetamine  but will result in varried but similar effects, flavor,and numbing tang also cutting the starter fluid with some lemon Windex makes it so much smoother
if you dont know spanish los pollos hermon are the chicken brothers
It is ... acceptable
whats the background song its 100 emoji flame emoji🔥💯
Jesus, Im now craving some of that chicken.
Oooh he did a Blendtec reference XD
So I made this tonight, the chicken meat was juicy and wonderful but the batter was bland, not crispy, and doughy. I would appreciate any comments on where I went wrong.
sonobabish 💀

This Chicken Was Very Accurate.
i dont think there were curly fries in Breaking Bad -_-
"My name is Gustavo, but you can call me SUS"
jesse, we need the methé
I made them best thing ever babish
was the chicken bland? seems bland to me, im not sure.
He yo you didn’t season the chicken who’s mans is this 😂
I shown this to Gus Fring and he was blown away, you should have seen the look of his face
4:14 didn’t they say they fry with corn or soy oil? I’ve watched the videos
Mr. Gustavo Fring approves.
babish send me some of those chicken
Me watching this in Ramadan

Where does one go about obtaining a hwisk
They’re “Acceptable”
Someone I don't like the fry's Gus haha I was only acting OR WAS I  (Stare Intensifies)
I wanted to try that chicken so bad i just know it was flavorful
Y’all sleeping on the will it blend refference
Losshh polloshh
PH was based on a real restaurant called Twisters
Pollo 👍
I need this right now
manscaping: great choice of words.
Binging bad.
dude that commercial is so scary to watch.
My cholesterol went up just from watching this
Never trust a man that says “betwixt”
It is acceptable
Anyone else thought of Knucks when they saw this
subtle will it blend reference went crazy
Los pollos hermanos needs better decor
Not the actual recipe but nice job attempting
Spicy chicken batter and curly fries! I need this in my life!
I do dishes for a wing place and this is really interesting, really wish flour wasent awful to remove, I can’t just spray it all away I have to scrape these medal pans. As always amazing video
4:00 - this looks like a very tasty tomatoe soup. ^^
10/10 for the will it blend reference
Ah yes. I forgot about the spirailizer.
I refuse to ingest kranch under any circumstances
Wait hold on I stopped paying attention at "French"
goes hard
I have little bundles of basically the same spices that I carry instead of pepper spray.  I got a kick out of you inhaling it.
"What does family taste like?"
Afraid of deep frying food... Gus would not be happy that some beta male was trying to copy his recipes.
SPIRALIZATION? Oh no! HURRY GET IN GURRRN LAGGAN THE SPIRAL RACE IS BACK AGAIN! GIIGGAAAAA DRILLLLL BRE….. oh he meant potatoes
But was the chicken zesty???
Its 2022. Hiding your face is now uncool. Its the age of Tiktok millenial babish. Go with the times. Either show your face or dont post the video.
I don’t know how many times I’ve said Los Pollos Hermanos. It just sounds nice to say.
4:17 Uh, no that's an American minded person's thinking, because America has no cuisine of its own and the corporations dictate what you eat. So to Americans, deep fried food means fast food. On the other hand, most actual right minded people across the world have no problem deep frying at home, because they've been doing it for 1000's of years.
Idk man, jack in the box’s curly fries slaps. In fact, it slaps so hard, will smith would be jealous.
Box Cutter chicken
Can you make the crab rangoon from FARCRY 4 ??
codio ma quanto sale ha messo ???
2:04 xD
I like the blend tec reference 🤣
“Dont breathe this!” Mannn i caught that ‘Will it Blend?’ recerence!
"This is acceptable"
Dude this chicken is the definition of golden-brown
More like Batter call Saul
The secret ingredient... blue magic
0:55 Epic reference!!!!!!!!
are you Jewish?
Caloric BOMB
Remember, no half measures.
Hey guys welcome back to binging with babish! Today we're cooking me-
It is… acceptable.
Gustavo is a scary mf, but I love him.
Wow the owner of this restaurant seems so nice.
I'm not sure what makes this specifically pollos hermanos chicken from breaking bad... at no point in the show do they go into details about the chicken...   weird how all these breaking bad related content is showing up leading up to the new season of better call sal...
the amount of juice that came out of that chicken....
just come to abq and eat it for yourself
Breaking babish
Was that a will it blend reference “don’t breathe this”
Best part is that this guy looks like walt
Los pollos hermanos, but one brother.
Oh muh gawd it's so juicy!
One recommendation: fry a few batches and then make the chicken. Used cooking oil is best cooking oil. Just ask the 70% blockages in my arteries
0:55 I am a big fan of your "Will it blend" references in your videos
I have only now noticed that your logo is not in fact a combine metrocop helmet.
breaking babish
wasnt the gag at one time that the commercials said (and showed)slow roasted but it always was deep fried chicken
don't deep fry in a pan.
Will it blend? That is the question.
This is... acceptable.
All Hail Mother Arby's, especially thanks to their amazing curly fries.
How about doing Walter White's infamous recipe?
As a chilean, i dont think people really know what spices we use in chile
Your videos cure my anxiety
i HATE the curly fries!
Love the “will it blend” reference. Deep cut
Is it acceptable to you?
Alternate title: easy fried chicken recipe
I don't understand, they never showed a recipe or even hinted at a recipe in the show, so how are you making up a recipe and associating it with the show or the fictional stuff that's in the show? Could be a great recipe you're doing here but you don't have to make up this whole story behind it, just own it
Babish tbh kinda looks like Walter White.
Gus Fring approves.
Wow
what happened to the old commercial
Stop stating grams only!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's so pretentious.
I need some coca-cola
its the new halo infinite dragon barrel !
Babish keeping Arbys in business :D
The Will it Blend reference was gold.
Gus was from Chile?  Gotta say, Fring doesn't sound like any latin surname I've heard.
Any1 listen to knucks
The juicy is drip 🤤🤤🤤
The grocery store I used to work at sells deep fried chicken- we technically double breaded but after the first case had been sitting in the walkin for a few hours it was essentially a batter and then we tossed them in breading again- it created that shell without being super finicky
Definitely trying this as soon as I get a bit ahead in funds.
i love the classic will it blend "dont breathe this" callout
🍗🍗
0:57 this is the moment when babish’s lungs became walters lungs
Breaking with Badish
0:55 was that- was that a Will it Blend joke? It’s been too long since I heard one of those
Babish nah Gustavo fring
The best chef on YouTube
this chicken look special
This is the moment Babish became frysenberg
Batter fried is not “most unusual” in fact Willie Mays of New Orleans, widely regarded as the best fried chicken in America is a wet batter
Chickens brother? I’ve yet to watch it o= guy a= girl
Wait a minute... Cayenne.. Aleppo pepper... _coriander??_ that's the kind of bold flavor they enjoy in... *ALBUQUERQUE!*     which of course is where this lovely story takes place 🤠
Wait did Babish ever give us a tater tot episode?!?!?
Whenever I see curly fries all I can think of is Gus haha
0:55 Red pepper dust. Dont breathe this!  *Will it Blend music intensifies*
Next episode: How to make roasted peanuts and pretzels(airplane food)
Still waiting for the tater tots episode with that green Cajun sauce
Would potato starch work the same as corn starch, or may there be differences?
Imagine the leftovers this man has
This is the exact moment Babish became Gus Fring
i would love to go to los pollos hermanos ngl
I love this recipe. The chicken was so juicy and delicious. Thank you babish.
"...the country *whence* Gus Fring is from."
0:55 babish coming in with the “will it blend” reference
I'm also terrified of oil, and a baby with spices, but man. That crispy batter coat and the INCREDIBLY juicy bite? I've never wanted Babish food more.
breaking babish
Glad I'm not the only one scared to death of deep frying stuff at home.
late to the party, but for those that are afraid of burning chicken/crust while frying....an old trick is to shallow fry them(oil only covers half the chicken; turn when one side is golden brown and repeat for the other side) on high heat, then turn the heat down to medium/medium-low so they simmer in the oil. you are assured that the chicken is done while also preventing a burned crust.
In Tijuana, B.C. México we have El Pollo Feliz. But it's cooked on the grill.
franch is a great pun
next do the chicken from paradise PD
Why not ice water to remove the starch ?
His name is Gustavo Fring, but you can call him Gus
2:50 prank em john
You measure water in grams?
Hi and welcome to the los pollos hermanos family my name is gustavo but you can call me gus (sus)
I liked the will it blend reference. Nice :)
Im one of the 5 people that appreciates the Will It Blend reference
Amazing with that Will It Blend “Red pepper smoke. Don’t breath this” reference. 10/10 loved that
Oh my goodness
i literally got your ad on your own vid lol
Polio
No New Mexican twist or influence, SMH
Why would you batter fries lol
I’ll be your taste tester if ya want lol
Babish, the "don't breath this" reference HAS to be from "Will it Blend". Tell me it is so!
They need to open up one in Vegas fr
Some charlatan, counterfeit Babic!
i love how americans use 2 gallons of oil for frying, while they would have same finish product if they use 2/3 less oil.
This is the exact moment that Babish becams Heisenberg.
1:56 30 grams of what
Is it literally called The Chicken Brothers?
That fry batter makes me want to drink a six pack and smash that whole tray of fries. Never had spicy curly fries and now I feel like I'm missing out.
I need more recipes from that show.
Everyone missed the will it blend reference.
No one noticed the blend tech "don't breathe this" reference??
Those wings are... epic
Pollo 👍
Bro it's just chicken
Recipe not even close hermano
Yooo, I would love to eat at knockoff Popeyes.
there are los pollos hermanos restaurants
ima be honest watery chicken aint it
I dont know why but this drumstick looks scary.
Yara forever
pollo :thumbsup:
Gus: “ Where is my, *Los Pollos Hermanos?* “
Frying chicken is serious business
thank you for the will it blend reference
Hon hon hon! A little cup of French!
It wouldn't be so greasy if you roasted it first like in the show.
The "Will it Blend?" reference was top notch.
never thougt babish would stoop as low as throwing the crystal into a cooking video
A+ Will it blend reference
I mean peanut oil that is very very hot is much much more dangerous if you're allergic.
polIo👍
Ngl that fried chicken looks like a toy
If you buttermilk marinade your chicken then dip in flour+cornstarch and seasoning then back in buttermilk then back in flour starch mix it makes beautifully crispy chicken
Forgot about your channel since I graduated high school I’m glad I found it again
Bro cmon put some more seasoning on the chicken.
Ten babiš se sere fakt do všeho
It’s CLUCKING BELL!!! 🐔 🔔
I now understand why curly fries have the straight ones mixed in
You doin too much!

He should have used a box cutter instead of a knife in this episode
Is ranch and mayo same thing ?

At los pollos Hermanos Someone is always watching
Why has the salt be cosher?
“Try my WHAT?!”
Sibling chickens? What?
do roof pizza
I love how when the potato falls into the boiling water he just describes it as "Antics"
I'm sure that marinating the chicken in Cajun spice before applying it to the Chilean batter would make it godly
When the fried chicken suddenly make your hands melting
just go to popeyes
Stable video 👍
I am just going to McDonald’s after watching this
Can you make pie flavored pie from asdfmovie
I don't like bald people. They look mean.
Mmm reminds me of El hermano
this video is perfect for my potato mushroom based prank
the chicken from the title page is cursed. bruh . . . why isit so smoooooth
I’m the one who cooks.
Breaking bad is the Best cooking show ever
JUICY
I missed the perfect opportunity to call this “breaking this babish”
Hi i love your show but can you explain the flour and egg dance comment.Does this mean i can fry this in oil at lower temperatures?
Chicken bros. Chicken bros. Chicken bros. Chicken bros. Chicken bros. Chicken bros.
Hey babish, can you do Gus Fring’s Chilean fish stew?
I just love Giancarlo Esposito so much, he is the only actor I can name off the top of my head that can be both sinister, and friendly at the same time
MSG?
I'm not shy with spices but 15g of cayenne is muey caliente
I will live one more day then you because i didnt inhale red pepper smoke.
time for the tater tots video!
Thank you so much for metric!
the diamond.
He never did make that tater tots episode. Edit: He made the tater tot episode.
You may be subject to *antics.*
Pollo 👍
The BlendTec shoutout.
Sometimes I wonder if my general manager is also a drug dealer, I mean the other day she talked to some dude about.. nah, of course not lol
"What does family taste like?" I dunno man wanna go find out?
Now, where's the 'behind the counter' product?
He put more seasoning on the curly fries than the chicken 🤦🏾‍♂️
TIL there's a difference between breaded and battered
I heard Fring is from the same place Ken Hom gets his hen comb
Living in New Mexico it's cool seeing where they filmed things from Breaking Bad
Much easier just buy some ready ade Curley fries and use a airfryer way more healthy than your vile method glove boy!.
what would you like to have sir?  walter : Gus Fring  waitress : excuse me sir?  walter : Gustavo Fring, your boss now.
Fun Fact: The Breaking Bad TV Series Was First Aired In 2008 But Ended In 2013 But Fortunately For Them Their Reboot Counterpart Is Needed To Be Announced
Can you do anything from Green Book? Like the spaghetti and meatballs, the sandwich he ate when first driving Doc shirley or the hot dogs he ate at the contest?
I am very disappointed that there was no attempt at a “Breaking Babish” joke
I just noticed I have that exact same glass pie plate
They became known as the chicken brothers
they need to make los pollos hermanos a real thing
I always wanted to try these too
pOllo hermano
Note: You're watching an alternate version of Heisenberg cooking as a chef for Gustavo. Jesse is the one taking care of the chickens off-camera.
0:55 Is that a "Will It Blend?" reference? That's old school Youtube!
I want a Breaking Bad spin off that follows the los Pollos Hermanos employees who’s lives’ spiraled out of control after their boss was killed
Does that chicken really have enough seasoning on it feel like it’s flavour would pack after just a sprinkle
Wings > Legs
this is the exact moment when Babish becomes Fring.
Wish these had time stamps so I didn't have to watch the whole video again instead of just looking up what ingredients I need
0:55 Referencing Blend-tec Will it Blend, nice touch.
Awesome video... thumbs up from me.  The chilean spice chocken rub was excellent.  Who are these wackos giving this thumbs down ?
Why not using celcius when measuring in grams? Confusing for us europeans. Fahrenheit doesn't make any sense
u know this is an actual restaurant
Breaking Babish
where da tata tots
im not as big of a fan of arby's fries as i used to. i slowly turned to checkers seasoned fries :)
The curly fries look like lithium from astroneer
1:33 is my favorite part by far

Last time I tried a recipe from the breaking bad, i got blue rock candy. was a bit sour but man did it give you some energy.
0:55 BlendTec reference?
You should do Lalo Salamanca taco.
Indeed, a Will It Blend reference in 2020! This man's tastes routinely hit the right places every time.
I guess lung pain is on point for the featured show.
The spice name is Merken
it was supposed to be served with a smile.... 9/10
Next episode how to make Gus death
Comment so i know ive seen this
Did this and the batter broke while chicken is submerged. I have a new scar now
Chileans don't have spices.
Did you say, Family Dom is nearby we must hide
Love the Blend-Tec reference. Don't breathe this!
If it were up to babish he'd birth the chicken himself too
cikn
"What does family taste like?"
Next time, swap the flour on your chicken for Corn Meal. It holds together better in the oil.
1:09 What benefit is there to using Kosher salt for a dry brine? I read up on why chefs prefer Kosher salt, and this application doesn't seem to fit what I read/understand.
My father and me were discussing about opening a franchise of Los Pollos Hermanos. What's the process guys🙄🙄
The separate bolt serendipitously unfasten because rhinoceros thankfully cover for a foolish yellow. diligent, laughable butcher
Babish just dropped a freaking Will It Blend reference 😆. "Red Pepper smoke, don't breathe this"

Hey Babish next time use "merken" that stuff is great

"What does family taste like?"  You don't need taste when you got family ~ Dom T.
You've done a lot of fried chicken but...can we please see Minny's fried chicken from "The Help"?
"What does family taste like?"  Shhh, don't give the cartel any ideas
Babish: eats any food any type of way  His hands: we must bounce
This video is sponsored by AMC's The Walking Dead
Why he graming out spices like it’s sum za
A touch of baking soda would have made the fried chicken look much better.
but is it... picosito?
I’ve seen this video in my recommendations several times and I always think that he is holding a toy chicken wing in the thumbnail.
*BREAKING BAD SPOILER*                  I can't look at Gus Fring anymore without seeing half his face blown off
Is it sad that I immediately knew exactly what the dressing would be at the beginning of the episode?   I'm just going to go with yes.   But still.  FRANCH.
Why did banish say "what?" Whe saying where gus was from?
That commercial is sus
Only Babish can be forgiven for forgetting the "Los" in "Los Pollos Hermanos"
This is the exact moment babish became Lyle
True American cuisine at it's best.
The jealous lycra ecologically hand because twig overwhelmingly lighten near a thoughtful sing. overrated, profuse beast
Arent you going to wash the potatoes? They look dirty asf.
0:55 … did I… just hear…. A WILL IT BLEND? REFERENCE
What are the other spices at 1:03?
Dude I make franch
Make Gale's vegan smores and coffee.

Hello welcome back to binging with babish today we are making pixie dust from narcos
Will it blend reference?? You're my hero.
mmmm blended marbles...dont breathe this
Next we need Walt juniors breakfast
I’m confused, do they sell fried chicken or Mexican food????
anyone know the soundtrack of this video
Breaking with Babish
Doom oilturnal
That pollos hermanos ad felt just like a real ad. Boring royalty free music with smiling employees that you'd tune out
looks like udon
Instructions use a whisk  Me imma use a fork
I chuckled that all of his measurements were metric, except the quart of oil and Fahrenheit temps.
manager is sus ngl
Never use gloves when frying unleast you want die in pain
I wanted to make these but realised I don't have a tiny whisk :(
I thought the intro is an ad
gus: "it is sufficient"
Today we have death in dinner🔥🔥🔥
okay, i feel the need to ask anyone who's made this, how does this compare to KFC/fried chicken place of your choice.
that batter looks dead accurate, i'm not gonna lie.
I watched this on Netflix and about lost my mind when I thought they put a commercial in the shows
Pizza shaker for the spices!  I use a Spirooli.  $30 on Amazon.  You can make a long cut to get circles instead of full spirals.
There are a lot of bald heads in the Breaking Bad universe.
I bet gus produced some top notch chicken
After the Mandalorian, this has just become 'Moff Giddeon's imperial fried chicken'
watched this before finding out the very nice man in the advertisement was a psychopathic killer
do i have to get blown up after i make this
wait what if you added tobaco flakes on it so it can be addictive
Beautiful
what if we can add a salsa to the chicken and combine with the juice, it can be thiccness
The fact that no one has made a comment talking about Babish's amazing reference to "Will it Blend?" makes me sad 0:54

The chicken looks so fresh
I caught that "will it blend" reference Babish.  Everyone else might have missed it, but I'm on to you, you sly dog.
TATERS!
2:29 😂😂
Praise be to Mother Arby’s
No chili powder in the fry batter? WEAK. Then again, Fring never liked that Pinkman kid.
What happens if i sniff it 0:55
Ew.
I love how the add shows Los Pollos Hermanos being a nice resturaunt, but in reality, it is a false job to hide Gus's  life of crime.
2:06 people who've never seen Breaking Bad are incredibly confused, and are wondering if Babish is a drug dealer now.
I find Moff Gideon adverting fried food uncomfortable.
Is there a way to make a non spicy alternative to this recipe? There's a lot of spices used, so is there a powdered alternative to the spices so the chicken has the same texture, with a milder flavour?
Grams and °F. You have officially made it so no one can follow!
Love that nod to "Will it Blend" when you said "Don't breathe this"
any breaking bad fans out there!?
0:32 the caption says French and it should say Franch
Babish: Como les puedo ayudar? Comment section: ...tu sabes.  Babish: Cuando baje el sol.
I wonder what happened to the customers who didn't like the Curly Fries.
Just made this. Tasty at, but I agree that it's weird to batter fry the chicken as it does get finicky, BUT very tasty and juicy!
Pro tip, if you to are terrified of deep frying at home, use a dutch oven and not a cast iron skillet, much safer take my word. ALWAYS KEEP THE LID NEARBY GREASE FIRES CANNOT BE EXTINGUISHED WITH WATER YOU HAVE TO SMOTHER THEM.
That looks like it can go so hard with some dry wine and I don't drink. Just imagine  the flavor combination station 🚉 😋 😍
Ehhhh pretty sure those ingredients aren't commonly used in Chilean cuisine
Ranch? 😉
Breaking Babish Episode 69: Red Pepper Powder Lord
What does Family taste like? Why don't we ask Dr. Lector?
i am chilean and first time i see this spice mix (cayenne and aleppo peppers, paprika and coriander seed) but i can see that it is very similar to Merken, which is dried and smoked chili peppers, which is called "special merken" when mixed with coriander seed and salt.  aleppo pepper is a new one though, never heard of it until now.
You bald. So it makes sense
You should do tater tots from Napoleon Dynamite
Imagine eating a chicken wing and getting high
0:55 a nice Will It Blend? refference
Chicken Siblings
There is no such thing as Chilean cuisine
Nice. I forgot about the word "betwixt."
Breaking bad has ended up with me at popeyes too many times.
Isnt it in better call saul as well?
banish sussy baka

Why have I watched this ten times
Am i the only one who read "pollos humanos"?
Bakit mukang jollybee chicken joy

0:01 what does family taste like
What kind of man uses flour and egg for his fried chicken? No man
Whe should show him the transfer plan for Jim Hoxworth.
me: uneducated self-studying person learning Spanish  pollos hermanos = chicken siblings????
Worst thumbnail in Babish history. looks like fake food
Where's the Phenylacetic acid?
Jerry rig everything and Binging with babish are the same people, change my mind.
When he showed the potato mushroom thing I couldn’t help but think of pp jokes
Gustavo scared me after the box cutter incident
It would be so cool and funny if Giancarlo Esposito (the Actor of Gus Fring for those who don't know) saw and reacted to this
Could those fries be made in an air fryer?
I do believe he missed out one important ingredient :)
Ya gotta check out Century Soup from Toriko!!! 🙏🏽
Just cuz of this video I’m rewatching breaking bad
I have to watch breaking bad again.
Loved the quick "will it blend?' reference hahaha
This guy......AWESOME! A!!
Ending song?
Tator tots episode?
where is Gustavo Fring ????
We ask him to do recipes from breaking bad and he makes food😔😔
Oh koriander... Soap chicken :/
Some tasty quotes from a supreme drug lord
Has someone tried this thing? Let me know if it's that hard to make?
So disappointed he didnt raise his own chicken and make chicken out of it
Mexican fried chicken?
you forgot the secrete ingredient
Unfortunately I'm vegetarian so this is a Breaking Bad recipe I won't be making any time soon.
Perfect chicken
Still waiting for that potato mushroom based prank
im sus
Hey Babish! This Belgian prepared your recipes for both the fried chicken and the curly fries. Sir, this was EXCELLENT! As I already made fried chicken before, I was quite familiar with your recipe. For me, the biggest, pleasant surprise were the curly fries. Not just the flavor, but also the technique with the hot water, and the spicy coating before frying.  Take that from me : this means a big deal, coming from someone from "french fries-central" :) ! The hot water technique with the potatoes, is that an often used technique in the US? Anyhow : thank you for this recipe, I will check your other videos to see if you have other, such pleasant culinary surprises :)
As i chilean i can confirm i have never even heard about half of the spices he used
Welcome to the Pollos Hermanos family. My name is Gustavo, but you can call me s u s.
*this is the exact moment pollos hermanos became exist*
0:55 Jesse's secret ingredient for the extra kick was indeed the chili p
Miss watching BB! Best TV show Ever IMO...
this dude said mother arbys smh
Meanwhile Babish is being watched by Gus through a security camera to make sure he is cooking.
Boil 'em, mash 'em, spiralize them in a stew
Got commercial for food before the video...
I wonder what this man has done for the tiny whisk market.
Chicken looks like it came out of a cartoon
Hy skedadudlers
Ok what is a potato mushroom based prank lol
Oh Mr. babish can you make something with gator? I have tried a few recipes and they were kinda so so.
Fun fact, in Chile we don’t eat this... :(
Still waiting for the tater tot episode.
"Red pepper smoke, don't breathe this"  Thank you for this wholesome Will It Blend reference.
I tried this and couldn't get the fries to hold the batter. Turned out amazing but the batter was falling off
Hey Babish, it would be awesome if you make a cooking video with Joshua Weissman.
Glory to Los Pollos Hermanos!
The nervous satin habitually spray because piccolo hopefully announce despite a meaty bangle. naive, icky jewel
i know i may not get a responce but i'll try anyway, my chicken is juicy like yours however i get a kinda soft shell instead.  what am i doing wrong?
Not the pollos 😂😂😂😂 iykyk
Casual will it blend reference in 2021
0:55 nice blendtec reference
Use bats its cheaper
Chicken
Family is the best ingredient adds so much flavour to everything
Careful, we all know what Gus did with his "competition"
did he just put fried chicken on paper towels?
Dude, grams?!  Dude, mother Arby’s?! How is Arby’s still in business?
Some New Mexican hatch red Chile powder would have made this dish
I absolutely gonna breathe this
I like how the word "pollos hermanos" feels in the mouth
Remember that your frying baskets must be 100% spotless, sterilized clean.
I know it may not be appropriate, but I've always found that adding eggs to a flour based batter tends to make the food too "grease-absorbing". I prefer to stick to only egg whites if you really need the eggy texture, and use the yolks separated instead as a part of the marinade/rub if you really need the yolk flavor. Otherwise, I usually just take out the eggs and use water or milk instead.
For those wondering family actualy tastes like blood and and realy tender meat
Giancarlo Esposito?
Wheres my Blue crystal for dessert?
The manscaping Joke Got me 🤪
Restaurant depot
Man-scaping with giant scissors... seems pretty babish LOL
Legends say Gus Fring wanted to taste that chicken to see if it's the match to Los Pollos Hermanos
Mother Arbys? More like Trash.  This post was made by Jack in The Box gang.
THIS IS MY OWN PRIVATE DOMICILE AND I WILL NOT BE HARASSED...
Hannibal version:  Pollos Humanos
The fact that these are named "the chicken brothers" in Spanish is very amusing to me
Babish: Spiralizes your tater. Me: Whoa babish thought this was a cooking show.
The los pollos hermanos chicken has a truly explosive flavor tbh
A yes, the MAGICAL electromotic company from breaking bad...
the potato mushroom made my day
0:48  "What's Aleppo...pepper?" ~ Gary Johnson, possibly.
Oh dude, I'm hungry now!
I like to add a dime of Blue Sky in my fried chicken batter. Elevates the chicken flavor to a whole other level 🍗👌
0:41. "Because for now we have to make everything."
It is acceptable.
Could you use a deep fryer (like those covered countertop electric ones) to avoid splashing
You do delivery?👀
The confused ambulance preauricularly irritate because italian informally haunt apropos a chemical drizzle. separate, elite sack
in one of the commercials for los pollos hermanos (promo for better call saul) gus says they are going green by using soy corn oil... something like that. it definitely is not peanut oil though, a little late but just thought you should know

Breaking Babish
Oh brother
You forgot the "secret ingredient", that makes it really addicting.
Using plastic gloves to drop chicken into scalding oil seems like a fun way to melt your finger from a few cm away lol
I’ve never seen breaking bad, but I have played payday 2 and I wonder why the dentist is running a fast food chain
6:09
U know the smiling restaurant workers look like the ones from gta San Andreas
Mother Arby’s??? Please no
I got a binging with babish ad on this video
Nice but Gustavo had said it's chilean recipes revisited to suite the mexican taste, so more spicy and limey and a bit of cumin would have been perfect ;)
"Always delivered with smile" I dunno 'bout you man but everytime i see those faces it creeps me out
I was hoping the chicken would be extremely juicy. That's what Lalo says about it.
My name is Gustavo, but you can call me sus
Now it’s from BETTER CALL SAUL.
I'm following solely because of this video.
Excellent.
I'm sorry, but the ingredients on the buckets in the show clearly list methylamine and mechanically separated chicken faces, and other ingredients you missed 😤
So when *is* the tater tots episode?
Hello, & welcome to the Los Pollos Hermanos Family, my name is Gustavo, but you can call me "Gus"
"Deep frying at home scares me" Adam Ragusea has entered the chat
I’m glad I’m not the only one who’s scared of deep frying at home.
happy walter white noises
You didn't soak your chicken in buttermilk overnight first.  Southern cooking 101 soak your flying critters and swamp things in buttermilk overnight first, that chicken looked fantastic btw.
The tough stranger functionally mend because edge intradurally dare down a well-to-do wheel. fanatical, unarmed pasta
2:05 what...?
Tater Tots when?
Next: Blue stuff from Breaking Bad
This was weak.
Ok
The lively comparison bareilly melt because jeans regrettably admit for a easy airship. parched, spotless kite
I wish this was real
d-did that chicken nut in his mouth?
You should totally re-create the dips in the Madrigal episode.
I was making churros and dropped one just a little carelessly and a large drop of oil landed right on my finger. The blister bubble was massive and painful, please be careful
A will it blend? Reference truly cultured

Pls come over to my house

man that crisp on that chicken looks delicious!!
Late to the video, but the proper phrasing is "from which Gus comes."

I got an ad from babish in a babish video😳
usually chicken is not batter fried .........oh ok 🙄🤫

Potato mushroom
Looks like a fried chicken
One time when i flipped a burger, a lot of the hot oil splashed onto my hand and i threw the spatula almost into another room (the oil made basically a river between my middle and index finger)
Breaking with Babish
Drool. Not juice. Lol
I got a bwb ad on a bwb vid
I just wanted to re-watch this is video and guess what I saw? A Botanist Gin Ad....your ad specifically.
Why are we still waiting for Gus Fring to be on Hot Ones? :O
That song has very ‘Snow’ like sounds to it. Great video. Keep up the awesome work brotha man!
That Will It Blend reference really took me back haha
It’s unnatural how realistic that commercial is...
Jesse !!! *JESEEEEE!!!*
😫😫😫
This is the exact moment where babish turned into heisenburg
Jack in the Box curly fries are waaaaaay better than Arby's
I have a cup from loot crate that has los pollos on it
OK, what is the deal with Americans and being scared of deep fryers? Basically every household has a dedicated deep fryer in their home here...
...we have to make, everything...What?
Yo it's the same guy from payday 2. A.k.a the dentist
It’s los pollos hermanos not just pollos hermanos
I like your channel a lot man
We want the beef brisket recipe from Young Sheldon. Pllllls!
Every time I deep fry meat it comes out raw but golden on the outside lol
Currently making this, waiting for the chicken to be ready to fry. I’ll let you guys know how it goes 😁
cannot believe I saw a "will it blend" reference in a video made last year
It looks pretty amazing.
I 🗣️ 🇪🇸🇪🇨🇲🇽 And "pollos hermanos" is just weird
This is great! Now do Hannibal (tv series)
Driest sense of humor on the internet. Love it !
It is...acceptable
why fry in a pan?? and not in a Friteuse
Quick time! Nice. Super pumped for this.
look out joe biden,its gustavo
pollos💪
Jesse !!!
I can't believe Badding Break KFC is owned by The Dentist.
you know the dance
Paprika? That is not Chilean, you need Merken, which is Aji cacho de cabra milled, or as you would call it, Red Chili
“Make sure all the potatoes are submerged”  That one piece of potato sticking out of the water: 👁👄👁
bruh i got your add on your video
Wow, the “don’t breathe this” line. What a call back to early YouTube videos!
that drop wasn't juice it was saliva...
boil your chicken before you fry it first
its the ram 4x4 winter event
am i the only one that is not scared of BOILING OIL? i mean, i worked as the guy who fried stuff in a restaurant, so... imagine...
“What does family taste like”
Some sort of potato-mushroom-based prank
How did I know that was franch
My biggest fear is bland chicken I get close to throwing up
Better call Saul is better than breaking bad a lot better
shoutout my guy LosPollosTV
Andy: "Red pepper smoke...don't breathe this." Me: Blendtec YouTube channel "Will It Blend?" video intro song zooms through my mind from about a decade ago.
Babish, please dont fill your deep frying pan to the brim next time...

Any aussies? Hogs breath curly fries are amazing only real ones know
try making heisenberg's rock candy next pls
the curly fries look like ramen noodles
I had a friend who could speak Franch.
Years ago I called for a tiny whisk t shirt and it became a thing i am happy
“What does family taste like?”  idk why dont you ask people from alabama
YES
I wonder what he did to that potato mushroom 🤔🤔
finally some recognition for Arby's fries. you can debate the merits of a half pound stack of luke warm deli cut roast beef on a bun with processed cheese and mysterious sauce but no other fast food understands curly fries with such grace
This is the first time I've ever seen that commercial ad, for Los Pollos Hermanos.
Curious if this work alright in an air fryer
Ese pollo es tan sazonado, es picosito y no sabe nada al pollo mexicano
Pollos hermanos means chicken brothers
I just started watching breaking bad and Better Call Saul Better Call Saul is way better
can you stop putting alcohol in literally EVERYTHING?
Could you put a stainless round cooling rack in the oil pan so the chicken doesn't sit on the bottom and scorch?
I don't want to know what family tastes like
It's funny because his account emblem looks almost like Walter White.
I didn’t know moff Gideon was demoted to fast food management
“we have to make everything”  *cuts to chicken coop*
I would eat at Pollos Hermanos.
Franch; ha!
2:07 whoa Babish
Is there any movie with LJS' batter fried chicken planks? I'd love to learn how to make those.
Los Pollos Imperiales
a non electric spiral cutter is like less than 30$..and when the bottom falls out and theres no juice i still got curly fries..and if you want curly fries you gota call Optimus and ask him to bring energon cubes...
Batter fried chicken ia absolutely the way I'll be making fried chicken from now on. I finally had the time and courage to try it last night and it was incredible!
Next do taco cabesa
Just wanan mention to anyone who thinks arby fries are bland, try them with horseradish sauce. I hated them until i tried that now they are some of my favorites.
instructions not clear. fell subject to antics.
Watching this while being high is deadass a rollercoaster
use potato flour instead of flour flour. gets them a nice crispness
first pollos hermanos, what next gallos hermanas?
Shoutout to Will it Blend!
Heisenberg makes los pollos hermanos.
Do not wear plastic gloves while deep frying.  That's a lost hand waiting to happen.
Watching this guy has made me realize I need a bigger kitchen
2:03 correction, batter too thin(not thick) like tempura
We need the tacos from turbo.
You can go home Lyle
Jessie we have to get chicken
The scary part about deep frying isn't the hot oil.  It's the oil vapor coating every surface in your kitchen and turning into a dusty, oily, gooey disgusting film over time.  Ask me how I know.
Look at the oven to the right at 1:42, my brain thought it saw a ghost for a moment.
Imma try this in our brand new air fryer.
"What does family taste like?" Well, That's cannibalism alright.
I feel like vintage Babish would have made something ridiculous and truer to the show, maybe put some drugs in the chicken, like some blood pressure pills or something. Now he just eludes to it, then makes a normal fried chicken recipe.
I cracked up when you started coughing because it caught me off guard so quickly!
Need to throw in some chili p
Subtitles: Los poyos hermanos
I'm just elated with the "Will It Blend?" reference 0:55.
“What does family taste like?”  Pork..  .. a- apparently
I wonder if you can air fry the battered chicken. I hate basically ruining so much oil for one dish.
I got a add of binging with babish lol
The Fris look like spaghetti when they weren't fried
This was awesome!
*You Forgot The Secrete Ingredient*
Also. Very disappointed that you didn’t wear a red apron over a yellow polo.
Don’t breath this!    Ha ha. Someone watched “Will it Blend”
Can’t wait till the tasteavision is made
I have t seen Breaking Bad before so when I clicked on this video I got distracted and looked away.  So I thought I was listening to an actual ad only to realize what it was when I heard Pollos Hermanos
You should  do  foods from monster hunter
I'm launching a petition for you to make Korean yangnyeom chicken🥺
It is.. acceptable, Babish. You can go home now.
I love his character
Too bad he died
What song does the intro sound like?
I've just finished watching that show, youtube is stalking me, tracking me down! I HAVE TO HIDE
I have big question how much shows do you watch
Stormy Daniels said that mushroom thing is Trump's d!©k

I just saw an add about you ! 🤣
"don't breath this" Get the gas mask mom's asando los chiles!
Why are you so ominous!
Fry using a medium to large wok is safer and easier than a cast iron skillet
MAS spices on that chicken and I'd body it.
This legit translates to the chicken brothers😂
You are very brave to be deep frying in that shallow of a pan. Not exactly safe.
jumpscare at 2:29
It looks like a normal KFC drumstick not gonna lie
Make "paila Marina" of breaking bad
Apparently the actual restaurant is trash in real life. The recipe is rubbish
Throwback to the Will It Blend days.
Will it Blend reference 👍🏻 you are a true OG youtuber
The suttle "Don't breathe this" :)
You should have the actor himself test these out
Coca cola espuma
Thats a spice grinder? I've been grinding my herbs for the last 6yrs.... 🌴😬😂
I uploaded my resume to los pollos hermanos once but I didn’t get an interview because I didn’t have experience in chemistry...  Why would you need chemistry experience to work in a fast food place?
Personally I would use a thicker batter.   It's harder to apply to the chicken properly but it's stronger in the fryer.
Restaurant material
Lol I got an ad of you
No clean plate club :(
Moff Gideon had to do something after the empire fell.
I love how I had one of you own ads for makers mark
Mr whiter where is my methe
This is the best looking fried chicken i‘ve ever seen
Lol notice that he use grams instead of his usual tsp and tbsp.
i should stop watching food videos at 3:30 am
I got ur ad while watching this
The level laura recurrently raise because parentheses occasionally sound against a incredible satin. scintillating, ablaze mattock
Bain?
Dangnabit you beautiful man now I want Arby's loaded curly fries  ߹𖥦߹
I want to use those fries to make myself a bbq bunger
mother arby's got me. they were out of roast beef a few days ago tho so time to destroy
Was that Moff Gideon doing the commercial?
Fluids are measured in ml (mili liters)
WHY DON'T YOU EAT YOUR CHICKEN PROPERLY ? I SEE SO MUCH MEAT ON IT 😭😭😂😂😂
why is everyone so afraid to fry at home just make sure the oil isnt too hot and it's fine.
It is...     acceptable
if youre afraid of frying, you dont deserve to fry
Better then KFC
Everytime i see Gus faces my brain just be like"Hey want to see Gus and half of his face completely gone?"
put back in flour after you put in wet mix then deep fry u will thank me later
THANKS SO MUCH I LOVE GUS
Hrmmm
0:53 really had to catch me off guard with a will it blend reference
I see a binging with babish add when i am trying to watch his video lol
I think i will do that batter chicken thingy, but with chicken bites which more manageable
K O S H E R S A L T E V E R Y T H I N G
Please don't ever use a cast iron pan or any pan for deep frying again
moff gideon casually making chicken
As a filipino, I thought he was making a jollibee spaghetti and chicken meal going by the thumbnail
Pollo 🍗 Campero is the restaurant that looks more closely to Pollos Hermanos
Foodgasm :D
You have to do a colab with ordinary sausage.
Los Pollos batter was a lot thicker and darker but ok... I get the point of the video
Youtube, I watched this video.
I never knew I needed this. Hut I want to eat that chicken.
ayo the dude finnaly got some ads now
Babish: *slightly scurred of oil* Oil: As you should
Was that Moff Gideon 0:16
I like your vids,thank u 4 sharing
0/10 you didn’t hide methamphetamine in it
THICK

Your fries are so fancy
"Now thank me and shake my hand" - Gus Fring
Notice how he calls his curly fries "guys". This is because he takes pleasure in eating something he's humanized.
Me at 0330: i can hold my hunger till morning.  Youtube algorithm: naaaaaah
🎃
Gus is watching
Why is american scared of deep frying
Did he just say "add salt" instead of "add kosher salt"?! This is literally inedible.
how are you scared of deepfrying at home? i started doing it while I was a kid, burned my hand once but now im not rly scared of doing it. I make croquettes and tonkatsu and such a lot now.
Mabey moff Gideon want baby Yoda to make more chicken
Hey
“I know how he is that’s Moff Gideon”
The potato mushroom oddly made me very happy
In a galaxy far, far away, this is Baby Yoda's most favorite food.
Giancarlo Esposito looks like such a nice man, why does he always play evil people?
Next. Canyou make a heisenburger?with extra blue on the side
0:55 the way you said that... is that a Will It Blend refernece?
"Dont breathe this"   Now there is a reference that takes me back to 2007
Giancarlo Esposito playing a villain automatically makes that villain exponentially better, I hope it’s not just me who thinks so
You forgot the “los” is “los pollos hermanos”
Customer: "I don't like the curly fries, so can I take my money back?" Gus: "What kind of man doesn't like the curly fries? No man. No man at all."
I'd hang onto the mushroom potato bits. You could make another dish. Either poutine or chili cheese fries.
You must try some of the Chilean Merkén I think u will love it
The blendtec reference was nice.
Could one make Pollos Hermanos with buttermilk-marinated chicken?
Pollos Hermanos looks like a better McDonald's
You got one part of that wrong. This is not KFC,. It Los Pollos Hermanos.
Wait, no CUMINO??? Andrew, please are you serious rn?
Would have loved it if the other commercial was used instead. Still, great video!
jesse jes e i need the eme the
It’s looking as tasty as Popeyes chicken, Pollo hermanos would be their competitor
you look like walter white in breaking bad
Got a Binging with Babish ad before a Binging with Babish video. He's come so far *manly tears*
please be safe and dont deep fry with those gloves
just to let you know, batter fried chicken is extremely common, in the uk
Shoutout to Blendtec, don't breathe this.
"Breaking Babish"
5:16 I love how he says ‘death’
Weird that I'm watching this before a shift of marinating, battering, and frying tons of chicken lol.
There's a video in your ad
Moff Gideon!!!
"What does family taste like?"  *Hannibal joined the chat*
Voiceover Sounds like the pilot giving instruction before take off.
🇵🇹🍻
Today I cooked chicken with this batter. A total success!! Everyone was asking where I found this recipe ♡
you're free to go lyle
Death 💀 0:55
You know your chip.... er... fries batter,  use sparkling water instead.  Makes it lighter and thinner like tempura
The leftover fries in the oil spell Bab
Chicken leg: !!!!OHHHHH YEEEESS!!!!
Instructions unclear, added ricin.
That chicken explodes with flavor.
I just would like to add that AMC's curly fries are for some reason absolutely delicious(and actually not tremendously overpriced!) Edit; Yes I mean the movie theater
Schizophrenic mixture or grams and fahrenheit. Looks delicious anyway
what's with the music? Why is it so loud in your recent videos?
Yo that background music is pretty dope
I got an add for his channel in one of his videos
I got a babish add lol
I wanna try batter frying chicken now (deep frying doesn’t scare me as much as it probably should)
Do more stuff with Brad leone...please...please
Man moff gideon did some wierd buisnesses to get by before he got the darksaber
Disappointed that there was no 'tiny whisk till homogenised'.
Hey look, it's the Rotato Express!
I would recommend placing your food stuffs in hot oil without the gloves. Grease burns hurt and having molten hot latex stick to your skin doesn't make it any better.
Love that Will It Blend reference. Classic Youtube
The “don’t breathe this...” line brought those old Will It Blend videos from early YouTube straight back from my brain’s archive and now I feel reborn
I looked away while clicking on the Video & Involuntarily Tried to Skip the Chicken Ad at the beginning of the Video 🤣
I saw a babish ad on babish  video  it thought it was a intro😭😭😭
What about the seasoned curly fries?
Can you do a show that use baking instead of oil PLEASE!!!!!
los meths hermanos!
"Mother Arby's"
You're better than me at everything but my ex who cheated on me made some amazing looking fried chicken and it looked more like fast food chicken. The only difference and advice is use a wok. I bet yours tasted better but hers looked more like the part. The chicken ended up floating and not sinking to the bottom for whatever reason but that was what you were getting at when you said it sinks.
I got a mixing with babish ad on this video... Pretty cool
Watching Binging with Babish makes me feel better about living off of Maruchan ramen and Sun Ships
As a Chilean im offended u didnt use any Merken our own kind of red pepper flake
Glad I found this channel  👍🏾
I'm subscribing for the "Will it blend" reference.
I just love when he says evil stuff like bath tub of doom
Why do none of you Americans have like the frying machines here in the Netherlands we all have them

I kinda wanna bet that the family from the Los pollos hermanos commercial is buried in the mojave
Babish is my asmr therapy every night
I like the Will It Blend reference.
0:56 at this moment Babish knew he's not a College Stud anymore.
What does family taste like?That sweet sweet booga suga
“The chicken guy Right?”
idek what curly fries tastes like
i thought pollo hermanos were grill chicken
Don't wear plastic gloves near hot boiling oil, in fact not anywhere anything hot for that matter, it could cause the plastic to melt in your skin and hurt like a *****. I know.
NAH
i got a babish ad on a babish video wait what
Love to see homemade chipotle
MmMmMm C h I c K e N
I thought that chicken was regular chicken but instead of flour, it was cocaine
Why would YT unsub me from your channels...
"Hey, this is pretty good... why are we cooking meth, we should be doing this."
And this is the moment Banging with Babish became Heisenberg
There's a chain in LA called Golden Bird that I'm 99% sure also batter fries their chicken, and it also comes out absurdly juicy. That first bite basically unleashes a torrent of chicken broth. It straight up pools up at the bottom of the plate. It's the only place I'll deliberately order breasts instead of thighs or drumsticks because for whatever reason they cost about the same. Usually the white meat on a fried chicken is okay at best but those guys really nail it, and you get a lot more for your buck that way.
No one Not a single soul:  Banish: K O S H E R S A L T
Babish - you made an amazing business. And its time to share the wealth.
How did you not also make blue rock candy for dessert?
Es...     Picosito
Up
Thanks for solving my long-standing conundrum of whether to subject the ThermaPen to frying oil. Problem solved! Better every day.
when the add to this video is an ad that babish made himself
Babish: "Red pepper smoke. Don't breathe this."  Legends: *"WILL IT BLEND? THAT IS THE QUESTION!"*
Notice how Babish uses "we" when talking about recipe development ever since he hired a kitchen assistant! A guy giving credit where credit is due, I like it!
Milbei
Luci ce aparat e asta?
Friendly Smile More Like Creepy AF
Gus Fring is going to kidnap you now  for the secret giving
Good video but pass on making at home.
who else got that blend tec reference?
TFW you get a Binging with Babish add before the video
👍🏻👍🏻🤣
On the next episode of BWB we try Walters Famous Meth
I love watching you and emmymade but ye both have the same kettle, that spout is useless!!!
I'm a month late on this one, but, why the _hell_ don't restaurants save up their potato mushrooms for a once-a-day triple-priced order of mushroom fries?
Chili cheese taters
I just got an ad for Babish on Babish’s video
Too much oil for me! Discusting as fuck !
Nice 👌
👍🏻
atleast the ads at the start are babish ads, ill always watch those
I feel like Babish was having a good day when he was doing the voice over for this one.
👍
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
You never know who you’re going to change Andrew. I was recently diagnosed with a research diagnosis of CTE, brain damage, a current TBI, Neuropathy, progressive memory loss, in addition to already PTSD and Depressions and a plethora of other of conditions/symptoms.   Your videos are one of the things that still puts a smile on my face. I think you help more than you may realize.   Thanks for existing the way you do.  Even if you never see this or even if I don’t remember writing this, thank you.  For privacy reasons I used this past email/account. Dont come looking.
I just got a Babish ad. How? Why? YouTube, I’m already here. No need to make me want to watch.
Oh I saw you leaning into the spice mill like it was in slow motion. I've pepper sprayed myself more than once in 22 years of being a chef. Pro Tip:  if using a high powered sprayer like you'd find in any restaurant dish pit, don't spray a mixing bowl with cayenne  or any pepper residue on it. It vaporizes and turns the entire dish prep area into a cloud of absolute agony.
As a Chilean, we don't use any hot spicies besides pepper in our cuisine.
What's up with American's seemingly loving all things deep fried, but then treating the frying itself like a dance with death?
"It's to get some scissors and do a little manscaping..."  Only if the video is sponsored my Manscaped™ lmao
Why do I watch these while hungry?
6:08 be careful, you have been warned fried chicken lovers.
im hungry now
Didn't cultivate a forest, chop down trees, build a boat, create an international trading mercantile company, sail across the ocean, trade for spices on the international high-seas market, return home, cultivate the seeds in a greenhouse, dry the resultant peppers and grind them yourself.   1/10, lazybones.
Babish: "Red pepper smoke. Don't breathe this!" Me: *impersonates Captain America* "I understood that reference!"
I heard that Will it Blend reference in the beginning
Hear me out... Take the spiralled potato, bunch it together and deep fry the entire thing. Top it with many different options and call it a potato funnel cake lmfao.
Imagine he just starts cooking meth
if he doesnt use another salt other than kosher im gonna be mad
the un cooked curly fries are forbidden Spaghetti
Hi there Click Read more to what's next. . . . . . . . .Bald guy
Mushroom on a stick, Mr. Mushroom Head...
Idek but I’m in love with this guy.
tempura isn't a thick batter...
you forgot to add the meth in the batter
malcom in the middle thanksgiving special
That potato mushroom is so cute!
CAN YOU MAKE CHICKEN NUGHETS FROM LAS POLLAS HERMANAS?
That's funny, don't Popeye's, Church's and KFC use batter fried chicken?
hey babish every time i try to fry battered chicken the batter always seems to be apart of the oil buy the end of the session why is this?
Then you find out he is cooking meth in the back
i should not watch these videos at night
I never even saw them, but I always wanted to try the hot dogs from the spot where all the biker gangs and meth dealers would hang out
he made batter thin because you gotta stash meth easy lmao. i love it
Plot twist- their front ends up making more money than the meth and Breaking Bad becomes a series about ex-drug dealers selling chicken.
Maybe I'm a dumbass but I think frying at home wouldn't be so scary if you didn't use a skillet.
A better curly fry outside of arby's? C'mon, everybody knows that Jack in the box has the best curly fries.
Dude, you have a desiccator, but don't have a deep fryer, WTF?!!!
Why am I just making myself hungry
Wow! This chicken and those fries look SO good! ...Too bad i am trying not to eat fried foods anymore!
What kind of paper towel were those, Andrew.
Finally a recipe from a cooking show!
make something from sopranos
Like pollo campero
DIABLO MAXIMUS BREAKFAST BURRITO FROM THE TROLLHUNTERS
How come deep frying is very very dangerous? It's frying. No more dangerous than making soup with boiling water.
I have to give a big compliment here. Although the language is spoken quite fast, I understand everything very well as an not native speaker.  And the best!  Grams instead of pounds or some other funny information that nobody else in the world uses!
0:55, was that a "Will it Blend" reference in 2020?   Glad to know this channel pays respect to the OG clickbait channels!
fried potato mushrooms sounds like a fun halloween themed dish tbh
Heh, Tom
Failed fried chicken
Lets be honest here we didn't watch this to cook, we watch this because it's Satisfying
wowowowowowowowow
gus
I'm not gonna use the potato spiralizer. I'm gonna cut curly fries at 2000RPM on my lathe instead
You ever look at his Youtube avi and think... Heisenberg in disguise ?
do you know how to cook the blue?
lmao i got a “Mixing With Babish” ad on this and was so confused cause i thought you had edited on a skip button for some reason
HELL YEAH !!
Babish never fails
Dudes gotta eventually run out of culinary media references
binging with banish: blue sky crystal meth from breaking bad
Ruining good fried chicken
if Tuco is the one who eat that. would be like : you tight, tight, tight
Arbys took the cordon bleu off menu can you show us how to make those please
Can we skip the vodka?
If you don't like curly fries man.
👍👍👍
👍
Gus Fring gave me nightmare when I was watching the show. He was real scary
👍🏼
👍great
Terbaik
Good!
👍
👍👍
Anyone know how to make the batter without adding alcohol?
"Don't breath this, it hurts your lungs."
You forgot the meth.
If your name is Hector I want you to look at me
Now I have to watch Breaking Babish, all of it, for the first time.
Mother Arby’s™
So I assume getting half your face burned off is optional?
Now lets see you cook blue meth.
again, if you need an extra stomach to help you finish that good stuff....
Are deep fryers not allowed where you live? You have like 6 ovens already, lmao
Meth chicken
well Kev and Quang wouldn't approve of the way you eat chicken. Looks hella good tho
4:16 his reflection in the oil kinda looks like Morpheus from the matrix
*LOS Pollos Hermanos
I got a Babish ad while watching a Babish video lol
It doesn't hurt your lungs. It hurts your soul.
The irony is if you watch the Training Videos from Better Call Saul, Gus makes it clear that all Chickens slaughtered to make their franchise products comes from a free range chicken farm  That, predictably turns out to be bullshit. All meat is of extremely low quality, non USDA / FDA tested chicken and the Factory Farm itself is just a front for Walt and Jesse to make tons of Blue Meth.   Gus straight up even furthers his lie by comparing his establishment to something on par with Chick-fil-A, a Fast Food organization which got popular by claiming that by using Air Fryers over Deep Fryers their fast food was a healthier alternative to traditional Fried Chicken establishments like KFC and Popeyes
So I’m a chef and I’m wondering about the little whisk. Could u use a big whisk?
Gross.
What is a leppo pepper?
I'm starting to think that the salt they're using to season the chicken is probably pulverized crystal meth
0:09 That my friends, is the smile of someone that is living in pure sorrow.
When you're allergic to Peanut Oil....... :((
jesse were s my cocainer
0:55 Well that answers the question "Will It Blend?"
Hey Babish.I tried this and when I put the chicken in the oil, it was like I lightly CS gassed the place. Eyes burning and runny nose. Any idea what could cause this and how to not do this again?
You didn't even try to make it like it was in the show before you made your own variety. This channel is just getting lazier and more out of touch with its original audience.
the curly fries from the show looked like normal fries but curly, not curly fry seasoned
I like juicy and could care less if the fried chicken spurts out juice. I will try it this Babish battered way. The ketchup filled french fries are a waste of time. Babish tasted them stale and cold. French fries must be hot out of the fryer, salted and dipped in ketchup, my preference. Or hot and dipped in what you like.
mother arby’s
Shouldn't you do Chicken first instead of Fries? Since cooled fries get all... cold-potatoe-friey?
I don't know why but I have always had bad experiences with battered chicken no matter where I go. Except for chicken nuggets
I think I'll pass on the *"Chicken Brothers"*
Por que estadunidense usa tanto tempero desidratado em pó?
Prior to watching Breaking Bad, all my friends told me I would love Gustavo’s character.  They were not wrong.
"what does family taste like?" Alabama people: *breakdances*
Omg wait it looks like jollibee chicken iS THAT HOW THEY MAKE IT SO JUICY-
/
not me getting a binging with babish ad on a binging with babish video
That dry brine does nothing. Im sure there is no flavor underneath the skin.
This chicken is 99% pure
Not curly fries... These are Susy Qs...
ONCE AGANE 1:16  XQCL
No he is Chris Daughtry
Was he serious about the vodka. Deadpan humor confuses me.
Do paila marina next!!!!
it's so yummy. love it
Your ad was you... I respect you on another level now.
@4:18  *laughs in Southern*
Thats shockingly unhealthy I love it.
Pollos hermano is the dame as pollo campero
At first I thought I was watch an el polo  loco ad
Gus will say that it's satisfactory.
The scene of the death of gus fring was actually as good as this chicken
My favourite show  Such great memories
does anyone know if the vodka is necessary? or if there is a substitute.
bro what exactly is French dressing?
Woahhh I got an add from him before the video
Bro the ad before the video was a one with banish making a drink
I wish Better Call Saul would have a new restaurant in it so you could make food from there too.
Did you say       𝐓𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐓𝐨𝐭𝐬
Breaking Babish
that's the most delicious chicken i have ever seen
As someone who let’s  lives in New Mexico this brings a tear to my eye
Potato based mushroom prank
Why did u change your name from binging with banish to this???
Pollos Hermanos!?!?! Chicken brothers lol
Madrigal electrics babish
deeper pan, less scary frying.
That chicken just nutted in his mouth
this makes me wanna try meth
I just watched an add for Binging with Babish before watching this video. Dude, you're epic.
Mr.Babish I've been a fan of yours since 2017 I hope you do this for your 8 million subs video you should do foods from the big bang theory like spaghetti with hotdogs,Thai take outs,Deathstar Cake, Some of the  in the you read this and hope you do this thank you
You should do the the fried chicken from house of a thousand corpses
los poggers hermanos
Jesse we need to cook
i cant look at gus without seeing half his face gone
e
are there any non-alcoholic substitutes for the vodka
I’m sick rn and I can only eat saltines and dry Cheerios so I’m here torturing myself with some really good looking food
Can you make a video on how to make beer battered fish?
Babish + Heisenberg= Babishenberg  Yyyep
Mixing with babish ad on babish vid 👌
*YES*
What’s mother Arby’s?
I 100% approve of the Will It Blend reference
I got a banging with bagish ad on his own video.....
i would just buy frozen curly fries
Can I get just the chicken recipe in cups and tea/tablespoons and some directions for how to cook it in an air fryer? I just happen to have one and want to cook my money’s worth out of it.
I just got a mixing with babish commercial
You might want to lay off the meth before making your videos. Did you breathe even once?
It's crazy to imagine the time when he only had a few thousand followers!!
Frying oil isn’t that scary. Granted, using a gas stove means a little more danger than an electric or induction stove. You’re also using a really shallow cooking vessel so we can see the action. Use something deeper for deep frying, like a Dutch oven. Or a deep fryer, which is probably safer.
Can someone make Church's Chicken Better and/or healthier?!... Nobody listens. I guess they're afraid Church's will sue.... IDK... Sorry, but I love Church's Chicken, the gravy and well almost every menu item.... The only downside: I can't eat it or re recreate it to make it less greasy!.... 😭😭 It's a hard challenge.
Do I spy a monogrammed pot at 5:37 ?
Why is this only coming to my attention 3 weeks later?!?!?!!?
I just got a mixing with babish ad
Did I just get an ad for this channel while watching this Channel
Babish: *is scared of frying*  **loud Scottish laughter in the background**
Thanks for mentioning me
0:56  Is that a will it blend refrence?!
Does it need vodka? Or can I do it with out it
You'd have to be tweaking on meth to spend this much effort for dinner.
make food from the cartoon "chowder"!
2:54 Babish confesses to ruthlessly drowning 12 children
0:54 please tell me that was a "will it blend" reference.
DO THE RAW EGG WITH RAGU FROM HOUSE!!!!
My old school YouTube heart smiled at the way you said “Don’t breathe this..”
Those curly fries look so good
So it's basically fried chi- Babish: VODKA *f u c k*
must risist diping finger into spice bader
I thought I was going to learn how to cook meth here! What a sham!
Do the ziggy piggy from bill and Ted
After I barely survived a grease fire at home (I was making French fries way too drunk and fell asleep) and got some nast 3 degrees burns I never ever will deep fry anything on a stovetop ever again
Could you make tubby toast from the teletubbies
You mean KFC and Arby's took their two best things and made a restaurant?  I'm in.
I prefer my chicken rare
It’s no longer binging with babish😭😭😭
Can you make the chocolate turtles from Hey Arnold ?
If you’re reading this, listen to me, go try battered and deep fried enoki mushrooms
kosher salt counter: 2
Ngl.. the way you are using that skillet to fry the potatoes scares me
Wait isn’t pulverized red pepper just cayenne pepper?
I’m sure it’s been said but the “Will It Blend” reference at the spice grinder was sly and I loved it.
Fries too thin imo but the batter sounds delicious
I met Gus the other day. He came into the shop where I work. He was very polite.
If I have a wish, I would like to cook with you
You should open a restraunt that only served fictional food from movies and shows
Weed rat stew from Shrek
Reupload?
You should start a challenge channel, like using the tiny whisk to make a full course meal or something
Very grown-up of you do display the potato's mushroom side. 😁
All was looking promising but then he used the word "betwixt" and it was a game changer.
When I see Gus' friendly smile, it is still scare af today.....what an amazing TV character
you should use merken ,esa wea es chilena
Did u say meth ????
0:55 breathing problems with babish Edit:spelling
Arby's curly fries are thee BEST
Where's Brad Leone?
the will it blend reference :D
But thats not how he does it no vodka...
Los pollos hermanos = The Chicken brothers
make the breaking bad pizza on the house
Wtf is the dentist doing in a restaurant?!
2:14  Who else was sure the elusive side was gonna be meth?  *babish busts out a while ass methlab and starts cookin*
I've always wanted to eat the chicken from pollos Hermanos and I'm so happy that I can now!
0:08 That chef looks like Other Joe from the Angry Joe Show.
Fun fact: I was actually in better call saul
where's the babish brand tiny whisk?
When the ads for his own videos are him doing advertisements for other people😂 classy
look at me hector
i miss when you did a tv/movie accurate and babish version
That "Will It Blend?" reference!!!!
Peanut oil hits different
Pollos
He kinda looks like a Heisenberg
0:20 knowed to as "el presidente"
Seeing as Venture Bros may be ending, I'd like to see Babish tackle some of the recipes. Either Phantom Limb's hilariously opulent taste in charcuterie or hopefully making the fancy dinner that gave Monarch a nasty allergic reaction.
"Deep frying food at home scares the shit out of me. Hot frying oil is very very dangerous." Then why is my typical deep frying outfit just my underwear? Hm?
I'm not the only one who laughed at the Potato Mushroom... Right?
Fr when this video started I thought it was another ad lmao
When you're watching binging with babish and the ads are babish and everything is babish and you are babish and babish is your dog and am i glad he's in there and that we're out here and that he's the babish and that we're frozen out here and that we're in there and just remembered we're out here, what i want to know is where's the Andrew?
Should I add water if I don’t add the vodka?
FACE REVEAL   sorry this is my first vid of babish XD so yea i just saw a face reveal dint bully plez XD
As someone who works at Arby's I can confirm: Arby's is fast food mother.
will it blend? that is the question
Speaking of hot dogs, perhaps it’s been requested elsewhere, I’m not sure, but since I’m here I thought I’d throw my suggestion into the box- can you please teach us how to make Japadogs? Or have you already, and that’s just an episode that I’ve missed?  I’ve always wanted to try one but not only is travel up to British Columbia just massively inconvenient right now (hello and thank you for all the hours of absolutely delicious looking recipes and entertainment from MN/the Twin Cities, btw!), I am also not even close to financially stable enough to just jump on a flight every time I want to try a new weird and delicious looking hot dog. I am resourceful in the kitchen however...
those pieces are too pale, maybe 2 or 3 minutes more
stop putting alcohol in everything i don't think a family restaurant uses alcohol in their batter....
Trying this recipe in the air fryer before work this morning, first time using an air fryer or vodka in my chicken, hope it turns out good!
The oil level in the pans makes me cringe.  I'd use double the oil and triple the size of the pan.  Less heat loss when chicken is added and way safer.
He should’ve worn a Heisenberg hat in the breaking bad episode
Are mushroom-potato based pranks an american thing?
+1 +Sub Amazing Video.
I made this following the recipe a few days ago. I fucked up the fries but that was some serious chicken.  Thanks Heisenberg
Still waiting for the tater tots episode
Man I cannot get this to work. Outside is cooking way too fast. Looks like corn dog breading lol. Can anyone offer assistance with the struggle?
This is the only one i might be able to attempt
0:55 I really appreciated that reference
that was a better call saul ad tho
I need more babish adds. That was the first add I’ve watched in years. 😂👍🏻
still not over gus' death
the will it blend reference brought back amazing memories
Babish you did it again you made me hungry your worst then munchies from weed
Something about that Los Pollos Hermanos commercial from the show is REALLY unsettling to me. Like...the smiles of the employees give me a “Stepford Wives” feeling and I don’t really know why. Someone who’s watched the show: Is that commercial SUPPOSED to come off as unsettling or am I just seeing things? (I’ve never watched the show. I know I probably should.)  Also, I would LOVE to see what you could make from those potato mushroom. Or what prank resulted from them.
BAGS OF METH
I have a recipe for those "potato mushrooms" left behind by the Kitchen Aid apple peeler attachment. I received it as a gift. I left it in the box for four years in a closet. I would never need a machine to peel fruit or vegetables. I never cook for more than 8... But, I did once need to peel about 20 pounds of potatoes, so I pulled out the device last Christmas and went for it. I was surprised to learn it even had a spiralizing feature. Those mushroom potato butter were a cute and funny surprise to find. So, of course, I played with them. In the end, they make a really fine roast potato in the shape of fungi for two servings. Every 20 lbs of potatoes... two slight servings. Cute as a button!
I don't think batter frying chicken is too unusual I do know that Korean fried chicken is also batter fried
ya ya.. “regular” chickens from eraserhead
Love the Will it Blend nod.
In English, pollos ermanos means chicken brothers
This is what a Babish episode should be. No faff. No whinging bint. Just good fried chicken. Get on with it. If I could unsubscribe twice, I would.
4:53 obviously he has never gotten a brick of curly fries at a local county fair
I never watched breaking bad but I do you know that’s my boy the elephant from payday 2
Too much oil
That chicken looks fake
*Says that most chicken is fried without batter  Meanwhile Koreans having amazing chicken WITH batter
@Babish Now you've done curly fries. Do the meat mountain from Arbys?
pollos hermanos??? brothers chicken????? w h a t edit: wait no im dumb its chicken brothers. im guessing its Los Pollos Hermanos, The chicken Brothers
What can I use in the batter instead of vodka !?!??
Tbh I thought that was squeaky chicken in the thumbnail. Look good tho
soph
I really wanna try that gin.
Him makes basicly pepper spray Also him" let's smell it"
How does deep frying scare you? It's done all aroud the world with peoples eyes closed.
I like how you are mixing up your verbiage.
Do the soup from ratatouille ! <3
I'm a little dissapointed that he didn't pull a bag of candy meth out of the batter
Did you star uploading to LBRY? Or is your content that's being posted there someone else pretending to be you?
that’s to most appetizing non human leg ever
If you do another taco/enchilada/fajita/quesadilla/quesaritto video and hear something moving in the vents, don't mind me, just coming by to steal food XD
Why on earth do the fries first..?  the chicken takes longer and needs to rest anyway..  I don't get it.
How are there 10 pieces of chicken? There are 8
That blend tec reference tho XD
I'm watching this in 4K. Holy shit its so clear
Ok, so I think you should make the Bahn Mi from We Bare Bears!!! It would be the BEST!!
Find a way to make the coffee gale makes!
That "Don't breathe this" bit brings me back. Waaaaay back.
This was the moment Babish became Heisenberg
Jesse I want chicken tendies from Pollos Hermanos
**God Bless Scotland**
babish: coughs to ground chilli flakes my indian parents: *AMATURE*
the fact that he removed the sound from the moment he bit into it just kinda took my soul away for a bit.
this dude and seth macfarland should host a cookin show together
Do you accept my challenge? Then do that and help me
I didn't realize this was a breaking bad episode and then he said "we don't want it so thick that we can't retrieve our bags of meth"
Look at my recent vid 😳
beer is the best liquid for batters.
Truth: that restaurant is a Twister's; burritos, tacos, burgers, New Mexico food. I like to get breakfast there.
At least I'm not the only one that fears deep frying food over an open stove, makes me wonder if the other people I've watched doing this didn't know about the risks as they were so calm about it.
The will it blend reference was on point
That looks like advertisement chicken.  Apparently it also tastes good unlike advertisement chicken. Wow.
WAIT YOU PUT VODKA IN THE CHICKEN?!
dick brothers?
I don't understand why people in the US always deep fry stuff in such a scary way. Don't you have deep fryers? Small ones for home use ofcourse, not huge ones like at KFC. They are great because you can set the temperature so you don't have to check it yourself and adjust the heat. In Belgium pretty much 99% of households have a small deep fryer at home. (mainly because fries are part of our national dish, fries with beef stew and mayonaise)
What does family taste like? IDK, pork?
The commercial is from Better Call Saul though.
those curly fries might be the best looking fries I ever seen
The process wasn't too difficult and the crispiness and texture were perfect. Alas, learned the hard way that if you're going to marinate the chicken in a traditional brine, it will _fully_ soak up however much salt you put in there, so only use a little bit. Good thing I did a small batch to test the recipe first.  Weirdly enough, I forgot the egg the first time and it turned out super-crispy. The next time I made this, I added the egg and it became much softer. Either way, this batter does a phenomenal job of keeping in the moisture. I used boneless chicken breast to do nuggets and they were still juicy the next day, when white meat isn't usually juicy even 20 minutes after cooking.
Blendco reference will never get old
Do a recipe idea that pertains to New Mexico.
With you being from Rochester, I'm surprised you didn't try to adapt whatever Tully's does into this, since their chicken is battered as well.
next episode should be: 99.1% blue meth from breaking bad
I swear he will never learn to not smell spice powder after he blends it
Question: how do people stop their onion powder & garlic powder going all hard??
I have a question. Babish what’s the best gluten free flour to use for making most fried food? Girlfriend has Celiac disease and I’m trying to make some decent fried chicken for her haha
You forgot to add a hint of meth. (Just kidding don't do it, not even once.)
"Deep frying scares me."  Petition to get him to deepfry an entire cow and fill it with cheese
What does the cornstarch with the flour do?  .......... askin for a  friend 😂
Customer: "I don't like the curly fries, so I get them free right?"  Gus Fring:  (intense stare)
My dad always battered instead of dredging it. He would add flour, seasoning, and an egg into a bowl of chicken, mix it up with his hands until everything was coated and into the frier.
I love you babish!
Therapist: The Potato Mushroom isn’t real. It can’t hurt you. The Potato Mushroom: 🥔🍄
Babish really out here dripping the "secret sauce" out of his chicken
This is the moment Andrew became Babish
1:30 Esa weá es merkén?
That chicken looks like it would squeak when you bite into it.
The funny thing is that I have no problem with deep frying, but I’m terrified of frying bacon and eggs.
Los Pollos Hermanos translated to English is “The Chicken Brothers”
I too am afraid of deep frying in my house, but I'd be way less afraid for you if you used less shallow pots!!! That oil is so close to the rim of your pans!!!!!!!
you forget the main ingredient-Meth
You forgot to smile at us
2:06 I’m dead 😂
got hid hidden valley ranch ad before thid vid
Seeing babish's add for the botonist reminds me of when he told us about how he used to edit out logos for work. Wild.
Suggestion: how about literally any of the dishes from the anime,Black Butler? I'm especially curious what you would do with the curry
Can you Please make the casserole Liam made in I AM NOT OKAY WITH THIS,  EPISODE 4 AT 10:30 left?? I just need to know I need to know please help
“Don’t breathe this” u already know I’m gonna breathe it
Genuinely surprised he doesn’t clean potatoes before using...
Why the vodka? I'm not chef so this is kinda confusing. I've heard of beer battered chicken but never something with vodka
Doing Manscaping with scissors sounds dangerous.
An ad staring babish before a babish episode? Well I say 😏
Loved the will it blend reference, youtube OG
Why am I still laughing at “Potato-mushroom-based prank”
I knew it was futile but I still yelled "NOO!" when you bent over to sniff the pepper. I'm drooling over those fries!
Nice Will it Blend reference there!
:55 excellent “will it blend” reference
Buen pollo bro
mother arby's lmfao
People don't batter fry their chicken? Did I grow up in a lie?

Baaaabish my friend!!
No words
Disappointed that there was no 'tiny whisk till homogenised'.

Babish - golden safety tip for deep oil frying - whatever the depth of the container you're doing the frying in, fill only up to a 3rd the height, no more.
Excellent as always. Thanks Andrew
I AM VERY ANGY, WHY WAIT TILL TATER TOT EPISODE TO SHOW THE OTHER SAUCWEEE RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Does Arby's know you giving their secrets away?
God, watching you cook makes me hungry
ANDREW! MAKE THE FRIED CHICKEN SUNDAY FROM SOUTH PARK!!
Liked for "mother Arby's" lol
Can you do Gabagul from The Office.
Just finished BB
you should of use a wong the chinese cooking pot for the deep fry your food.  you know that half-sphere for they are suitable for cooking those.
OMG the will it blend reference. Memories restored that I thought were lost.
What type of oil did you fry the chicken in.  Was it the same Peanut Oil as the fries?
No wonder you're scared of frying at home, you're using such small pots that the oil nearly runs over! Seriously, all that expensive cooking equipment and you don't have a plug in fryer or at least a taller pot?
Can you deep fry a rat for us please?
you should make Nicks fondue sauce from new girl
You don't need kosher salt. Its a scam. Just use sea salt
NICE REFERENCE  0:55
These look legit good, maybe i can try them with chicken tenders.
You should do some food from the anime, Food Wars!
Jesse where's the cocainer?
Hey Babish! You know Game Grumps? Would it be possible to prepare the sandwich from Arin's rant about Subway?
Bags of what......
Nobody:  Babish’s ads: *appears before a video* Me: yes, double the content.
what does family taste like? fleshy, a little sweet, and a hint of saltiness.
I got a Binging with Babish ad before this video 🤦‍♂️
2:08 our bags of what
*Babish saying pollos:* pUeRros
So, can some do the conversion of grams to cups for those liquids cause idk how much to use 😐
I've been frying my chicken this way (no water, just vodka) since I came across this recipe for the fish part of the classic fish & chips and I always feel sorry for people doing it the old "floor and egg" way instead. Poor bastards ;)
Gus is from Colombia, not Chile.
i was just trying to learn how to cook drugs, not chicken
This channel is the cooking equivalent of the meme where they take cartoon characters outfits and find the most expensive equivalents to “steal their look”
I want him to use that new brick oven
Do you know ALBAIK? no? You need to try it then
Lol the beginning looked so real, I thought it was a real ad until that payday 2 actor showed up.
A bit of a stretch, but how about pig's feet from The Naked Director?
imagine if there was any psychotic gang members as real restaurant owners ? i guess there must be some lol
You should do “The Curry of Life” from Naruto.
$:18 Having done my first pass at deep fried shrimp recently, I feel SO MUCH better that even the master of making it easy shares the same thoughts I have. I use a big dutch oven though, vs the fry pan.  I get much less scared when its got more thermal mass (my stove top is prone to some temp swings...) and its got a nice solid lid to put out any disasters.
Can vodka be replaced with something?
You cant even do fries without that thermometer? Hahahaah🤣🤣🤣
Next video: Christian's Pie with drink from Midsommar please
I like the blendtec reference
Did you fry the potato mushrooms
Weird getting an ad with babish voice then watching his video. Anyway, make the Liquor ball sandwhich from trailer park boys.
*you cannot tell me that doesn’t look like chicken joy from jollibee*
You Suck At Cooking Andrew
woow the owner seems so nice i cant imagine if he would turn out to be a ruthless druglord
Do you know your side comedy is funny as 😂 your voice is almost asrm as well.
0:54 damn Babish really hit us with a 'will it blend' reference.
you should make rossi's pasta from criminal minds
Babish I'm begging you to remake the meth recipe but with the actual recipe
Just imagine if gus had made a version of Popeyes fried chicken sandwich.  Amazing.
Oh to be a potato, spiralized over a bowl of boiling water
that drip that drops from the chicken looks like pre leaking out
"Mother Arby's" 😂😍😂
Okay but i want a potato mushroom fry...
algun otro chileno que le de risa que no tenga ni una wea que ver con chile? jajasafj
The new kitchen looks   t a s t y
Might try these with cornflakes for the extra crunch.
was the juice or drool from that first bite? That fried chicken made my stomach roar.
My dum self was like is that a real restaurant?
Nice well it blend reference lol
Imagine getting your own ad to play before your video
Can you make sooby snacks from scooby do?
I just had an ad before this video about The Botanist... WHAT
It's a shame you didn't have a Porkpie hat like Heisenberg for added aesthetic :D.
Next I’m gonna add a little bit of salt...  -adds a lot of salt
Popeyes batter fries their chicken
He should make crystal meth from breaking bad, but it's not actual meth but instead caramel crystals
Good, good...now make the nachos Jessie eats while waiting for his gun.
Was that a reference to the Arby's Man?
Barely seasoned that chicken
This looks a lot like Bojangles! Can’t wait to try it!
Why the hell are we making meth?
“red pepper smoke... don’t breathe this” the good ole days if will it blend. literally no one knows about that show

Im waiting to see babish do chicken livers from "the devil all the time"
Yooooo a tater tots episode
TATERTOTS EPISODE SDBFDAOUOMFGGGGG

About damn time Babish!!
Cajun kick ass
Can you do your food of choice from the anime Food Wars? I’m pretty sure you’d like the anime lol
Bruh i accidentaly drinked those 30g of vodka...
As risky as you make it sound, I REALLY want to try this chicken recipe. YUM!
I snorted at the "Will It Blend?" reference 😂
This is a shot in the dark, but Madeline's Strawberry pie from Celeste
Nice Will It Blend reference lol
Great video! But please please please never get this near hot frying oil (or any fiery stovetop actually) while wearing plastic gloves again! They can melt onto your skin if they get too hot and result in burns th;at are way worse then you'd have if you weren't wearing gloves.. wouldn't wish that on anyone
Why does he always use kosher salt?
30 grams of Vodka? Really?
I love the Will it Blend reference
I was just waiting for Gus to pop out hahahah
Here's a tip, try using club soda instead of vodka, I've heard it makes the breading more crispy
Make the fajitas from full throttle salloon reality tv show
And the voice is like young Mike Ehrmantraut.. Saw this channel just now and immediately subbed..
Vodka 😅
Peanut oil, gross
Anyone else get  a bwb advert before this?
A lot of people batter fry chicken, it's actually not that uncommon.
He’s obviously never had fries from Checker’s (aka Rally’s).
At the end you were suppose to say alright now to cook some meth.... then fade to black.
I never thought I'd be reminded of the Blendtec Total Blender again... Don't breath this
babish: now we sprinkle me: KOSHER SALT
I dont get the love for Arbys curly fries, Hardees curly fries are superior
Would it be better to bear batter the chicken
Hey it was my bithday when you posted. Thanks Babish!
Babish, we need to cook
I’m sad he didn’t make candy meth
finally
I wish you would do some Futurama foods.  Nothing fantastical like "popplers" or "froot," as deep-fried alien spawn and bone-in cheese filled fruit like substance is kinda, well, difficult, but I've always fantasized about Bender's order at Fishy Joe's: "Fried Spaghetti Dinner Breakfast Pocket (for Lunch)" which I always imagined as sort of a Hot Pocket esque affair.  It's depicted in episode as looking like large mozzarella sticks. There is also LaBarbara's spicy curry goat, a favorite of Hermes, which in it of itself is a plot device for an episode.  Evidently it's spicy enough to cause the Robot Devil to shriek "it burns!" shorty after consuming straight fire, and also, according to insane robot Roberto, causes Hermes' own skin to be "Tasty!  Too Tasty!  AHAAH!" Can't forget anchovy pizza, one of Fry's favorites.  And there's too many Elzar dishes to name, many of which aren't all that fantastical.  I always imagined his "spice weasel" as having a cajun quality.
No one:  Absolutely no one:  Me: Babish and Simon Whistler look alike, anyone else notice this?
Good👍👍
in the show on the commercial, you see them grilling the chicken before frying. that might fix all the juices inside
you think children eat chicken with vodka?
9years later, the man did it
Please do "Binging with Babish: Blue Sky from Breaking Bad" next episode
There is no way I just got an ad on The Botanist, the person talking was Mr Babish himself....🙀
Even better with meth
He speaks too much
when in doubt, Better Call Saul!
"Deep frying scares me."  *laughs in Texan*
Bro i just had banishes alcahol commerical on this lol perfect timing
Babish: Don't breathe this. Me: It's an old reference, but it checks out.
Amazing !
Please make the curry bread from Black Butler
Bruh Ik u just did fried chicken but at some point can you do the Greg James fried Chicken commercial with the Marty Daniels endorsement from Blue Mountain State😂😂🙏🏽🙏🏽
Always remember to wear gas mask before the grand whiffing, because that chilly-P kicks like a 12 gauge.
I get the feeling that he doesn’t like deep frying things
Do red kibble and lasagna from the Expanse
Do you have a blendtech total blender? 😉
“From 4 to 24hrs” Wow thats a large window
0:55 You're also a fan of "Will it Blend" huh? I see what you did there
The Will It Blend reference was greatly apprecaited

Those fries look like spaghetti
Mr White u stole Gus's recipe

I absolutely love you bab
Ah yes another breaking bad food video or as I call them, Breaking with Badbish
My friend made a Heinensburger with blue cheese and blue salt dip. I’ve got photos, looked and taste immense never seen anything like it.   Say my name fries as well, guy had it down to a  T.
cuando los chilenos han comido esas weas si con cuea les hechan sal a las weas no cachai nada pelao iwal veo tus videos
For the spices being "more chilean", use a mix between chili flakes (between the 5000-8000 scoville units), smoked paprika and some coriander seeds, put them on a stove at low to mid heat for 5 minutes and grind them. You will get some "Merkén", which is a traditional chilean spice blend!
Looks absolutely delicious
Title is a little confusing cause I couldn’t tell if you were gonna cook meth or friend chicken
Make something from the movie *'Burnt'*
where's the meth
Damn I better start writing down all my potato mushroom based pranks to pull this April...
YES
youre a beast
How about the fruit juice store owned by Salamanca  From better call saul.
You don't know how long I have waited for this episode. Can't believe I am 4 days late to it when  it's finally here.
Pointless observation#12. Your voice starts high pitch and ends low pitch with every sentence.
make gales coffee
I feel like the world would be a much better place, if all those heinous "youtube pranks" that people rightfully got in trouble for a couple of years ago had been jaunty, slightly raunchy, yet innocent and light hearted Potato Mushroom pranks instead...
i wonder how much dishes are babish washing in this video alone
What can I sub the vodka with?
i got a binging with babish ad for my binging with babish video
Watching the show rn
Through what witchcraft is the gas range top not covered with oil splatters at any point during cooking?
"What does family taste like...?" Lmao 🤣 never caught that b4 Yeesh!!
You got me laughing with the Arby's comment
I am the one who fries !
Where is the video that shows how to take apart the chicken
I hope your lungs are OK
Heisenbabish
Hmm I wonder if you could plant the potatoe mushroom and actually grows some new potatoes from it.
Bro i'm eating fried chicken right as am watching this, I feel the connection
Deep fry in a wok, damn you! Less oil, safer, deeper.
But did you give the cartel respect?
Tiny whisk to combine
I’m a vegetarian and this is the only meat I’ll eat
Favorite YouTube channel hands down.
Please do the Monkfish Turkey from Malcolm in the Middle!
ngl that potato mushroom cured my depression

Hey babby, I'm not afraid of deep frying at home, does that make me crazy? 😂😂😂
Let's cook Jesse

Anyone else get the botonist add
They were quite good thanks for the recipe
Your voice sounds like someone took Snoop Dogg's vocal cords, put them in a deep fryer, and then took singing lessons
Am I the only one who got a binging with babish ad?
Jeez those fries must be so spicy!
FINALLY
I like when you Cook that Chicken,, but i hate you when you ate it 🤣
Why on Earth would you make the fries before the chicken? They get cold faster
Is Banish really also the guy from"you suck at cooking"?
the chicken boy
Who else got a Pollos hermanos ad?
Best homemade fried chicken I’ve ever had we cooked the chicken sous vide and then did the batter and a quick fry. Sooooooo good.
And another Masterpiece. Well done.
Next time can you make that good looking sugar stuff they always make in that show? Sounds delicious
Can we get a tiny whisk shirt/sweatshirt
Why don’t you use a deep fryer?
Rough rider chicken from Clarence
Smh.
You should make the pasta puttanesca from series of unfortunate events
THAT CHICKEN AINT DONE‼️‼️‼️🥶🥶🥶
Nice ad!
Ok, so you have a fries curler tool, but not a deep fryer... I mean, they are dirt cheap and make frying so, so much easier.  No one of the big YouTube food channels use them? Why the H*** not?
will it blend?  I see you, babish
this is the first time has relisted that you have got a new kitchen
it is to much talk for me
Please cook meth.
Ugh every time I finish one of your videos Babish I feel so satisfied. Good feeling.
I just got bwb commercial on a babish video ... Wow

Now do blue meth.
Lmao got an add with Binging with banish in it
The funny thing is that here in Chile we don't usually eat spicy stuff, we don't even use that much of that kind of spices for cooking, the only ones that actually do that a lot are Mexicans. XD
My man just needed an excuse to smoke some meth
Lmfao "WILL IT BLEND ,THAT IS THE QUESTION" 🤣🤣
just rewatched this series and the timing couldn't be better.
Next Episode: Bell Peppers and Beef.
Do you think frying chicken tenders would've held the batter together or would that cause a similar issue?
You just wanted to make fried chicken, didn't you?
You should do the pizza from Narancias fantasy in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind

I always feel weird when he talks about how frying at home scares the f&*$ outta him...but I started deep frying alone at like literally age 7 or 8 so its feels as dangerous as checking my mail lmao
It will taste so methty
Binging with babish: Blue Meth
Can you do *KRABBY PATTY* from   ~SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS~
I don’t know if people know this food, but you need to do Maw Maw’s Magic Brown from Raising Hope. It was such a good show.
Oh my god ... that looks fucking delicious.  You sir, are a culinary genius.
Getting close to 8 million! I wonder what he is gonna do for the 8 mil special
The chicken in the thumbnail looks like one of those plastic wings you’d get with a kitchen toy set
Thanks for metric system :) that was very helpfull, love your videos.
Was that a blendtec reference?
Finally !!!
CAN YOU DO THE TRAVIS SCOTT BURGER NEXT.
Any substitute for the vodka?
I legit want to eat this, Babish open a restaurant dude
Why don't you prepare Blue Meth ?? From Breaking Bad..
Is no one else always shocked that Babish puts in SO much cayenne??? I'd put in--at MOST--a quarter teaspoon.
4:27 totally lmao
I think everyone of missing out on the fact that Babby here just taught us how to get the right texture on Chicken Express chicken wings too
Just seems like a cool guy  Must be because he's from Rochester.......so close to Canada 🇨🇦!!! Lol
Potato mushroom base prank lol
U gotta buy a frying machine on Amazon they cost like 150-200 bucks
Dude looks like keemstar
That is probably the most beautiful chicken I have ever seen in my entire life.
i NEED POTATO MUSHROOM BOI
2:06 wait what?       I know the reference btw
You're awesome Babbish
Why put vodka it’s a fast food place not a five star Russian restaurant
Jesse we need to cook
You forgot the crystal jesse
I can now see why Gordon Ramsey yells at people that make foods that are bad, even though some of them are good enough but the way they plate it is very bad and the colours are just terrible so that's why Ramsey yelled at them, cooking is like art and art is like a sign of love and everything always comes with love and passion.
can you do the fish dish from the lunch scene in Aviator
Your curly fries are burnt. You should have double fried it, in lower temp. Thin strands of potato fried in that hot oil, plus u couldn't stop when the potato were just cooked, cos it wouldn't be crispy. But if u want it crispy in one fry, it would surely be burnt.
Breaking with Badish
Should have just cooked blue meth
you forgot the MAIN INGREDIENT
where is my 20003 km/h of methe mr wigt

Did he actually put vodka into the badder 👌
Okay
Video: making chicken wings Babish: so first we gotta make some potato spaghetti
Finnish Parliament Group for Global Issues Chairperson Satu Hassi, along with eight other Members of the Parliament of Finland, raised serious human rights concerns in a recent letter to Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress Li Zhanshu, and Chinese Ambassador to Finland Chen Li.   In the letter, dated March 19, 2019, they expressed their concern about organ harvesting from living Falun Gong practitioners in China, and called on China to bring the perpetrators of these horrific crimes to justice.   The Parliament House of Finland  The nine Members of Parliament who wrote the letter are from seven different political parties in Finland, including the orthodox Finns, the Central Party, the Left Alliance Party, the Green Alliance Party, the Finnish Social Democratic Party, the Finnish Christian Democratic Party and the Swedish People’s Party.  The letter reads as follows:  Helsinki, 19.3.2019  H.E. Mr Xi Jinping, President of the Peoples’ Republic of China H.E. Mr Li Zhanshu, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China H.E. Ambassador Chen Li, Embassy of The People's Republic of China in Finland  Your Excellencies,  We, the undersigned, Members of the Parliament of Finland, wish to express our growing concern on the reports concerning the violent treatment of Falun Gong practitioners in your country. This topic has already been taken up several times in bilateral discussions between Finland and China on human rights.  Recently we have paid attention to the work of the Independent Tribunal chaired by Sir Geoffrey Nice. The tribunal is investigating allegations concerning forced organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners and other prisoners of conscience in China. In December 2018, the tribunal gave an interim judgement in which it concluded that these allegations are credible.  Geoffrey Nice has earlier been involved with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague, leading the prosecution of Slobodan Milošević, former President of Serbia.  Also the European Parliament (2013/2981(RSP)) and the United States Congress House of Representatives have in their resolutions deemed these reports of this sourcing from prisoners of conscience as “persistent and credible.”  The Independent Tribunal is expected to give its final judgement around this spring, when more light will be shed on these crimes and their perpetrators.  These are extremely grave allegations of crimes against humanity. We are aware that Chinese authorities have rejected all these allegations and labelled them as anti-China propaganda.
Those fries look suspiciously similar to Joshua Weissman's episode of But Better with Arby's curly fries.
wow fukcing tasty bro
Yeah, try telling Gus Fring that you didn't like the curly fries
Make meth now
POLLOS
Was that a "Will it Blend" reference? Lol
Fun fact: there’s los pollos hermanos food truck that parked down the street
Can you please start including freedom units?
We also don't want it to be so thick that we can't retrieve our bags of meth.
2:03 "too thick like a tempura" I'm pretty sure tempura batter is normally extremely thin in terms of consistency, not thick.
DAMN That looks good.
When you've affixed the cement shoes to your victims and are ready for step #2: 2:55
Nice Will It Blend? reference! What a throwback!
" Today , we are gonna make some chicken. " And then he starting to seduce a chick
Do they ever discuss how the food there is made? I know not everything he makes is described in the show/movie, but how in the world is he supposed to know how they prepared the chicken, seasoning and cooking alike? And the fries? I feel like fried foods are way too hard to "guess" and this episode feels more like a grab at a very popular series than anything really interesting or unique.
This is making want Popeyes
In the beginning I heard "how does bambi taste like😶😶"😂😂
Real talk twisters has amazing carne adovada that I ate multiple times while visiting Albuquerque and yes they serve with curly fries😛
Come on man not everyone has a food scale. BTW yes I know it's the most accurate form of measurement and yes I plan to finally get a freaking scale. But help out those who don't have access and can't just get one right now like this dimwit here. I have meant to get one and was thinking hey I want to make awesome curly fries and I have the way to make curly potatoes. But guess what I don't know how to make them well. So here I am. Wasting potato time writing this comment.
What am I doing here? I have homework to do. I don’t even know how to cook
The fuck! Seriously! That is literally the nastiest gin I have ever had! Which means it's probably one of the best on the market.
I heard that "once agane" mr. babish.
I appreciate the "Will It Blend?" reference.
i always get hungry watching people make food, but when i have to do it its like a burden 😅
Hot sauce is missing

Well looks like it’s time to make another cook
the thumbnail looks like a paper mache drumstick
"Don't breath this" ah....old YouTube "will it blend" well played Andrew!
Nice Will it Blend reference!
Next could you try cooking up the dishes in Filthy Frank?
I can't believe the first breaking bad special didn't include this lol
I thought that was a plastic chicken in the thumbnail
I dont think the recipe is correct, the chicken looks more brownish, remember that eventhough he is chilean, he started the restaurant in Mexico
I never watched breaking bad couldnt get past the first episode but everyone swears by it?
What kind of man thumbed down this video? No man, no man at all.
After he said "dont breath this", i really felt like breathing it
Just got done watching it
01:55 30 grams of vodka?
A 10-12 quart dutch oven is the key to home frying (without having a specialty deep fryer), as its deep enough to prevent setting your kitchen on fire if you drop in a piece too hard.
Dont forget the meth! Jesse!
Can i live in your house?
LOUS POULLOUS ERRMANOUS IJOLE
Good lord that ad is so terrifying the moment Giancarlo enters the scene

Love the will it blend reference.
Nah
Babish you put me to sleep last night and I forgot to charge my phone
as a chilean, we don't use that seasoning, sincerely, un weon
Try just the egg yolks, no whites.
yeah ok but can you do bubble buddy’s krusty krab order?
i didn’t use kosher salt.     my house exploded.   (disclaimer: this isn’t my comment. i copied it from another video. credit to that person as i cannot find it. if you find it please let me know so i can give credit.
I am so goddamn hungry
What can I substitute Vodka with? I unfortunately don’t drink
I just really wanna know, especially after this episode: how do you dispose of your oils? dumping down the drain is apparently a no-no and freezing takes 4ever, so would be really curious to know your method?
1:44  The South would like to have a word with you.

Why did I get a Babish Ad on a Babish Video..
I got your ad for “The Botanist” Gin right before your video hahaha
Chilean here. The spice mix is pretty accurate, the chilli flakes we use is from a smoke variety of chilli, and we call it "merquén" (or merkén). Usually for grilling, the spice mix is put in a bowl with some oil and wine and at least in my hometown we use a bunch of coriander or parsley to brush it on the meat. Of course, it's not the case for how fried chicken would go, bust I just though this was kind of interesting.
PLEASE PLEASE MAKE THE CURRY FROM PERSONA 5!! that sh*t looks delicious
Didn't even use any Diazepam. Smh.
Will you please cook the blue crystal meth next time?
Im about to finish breaking bad
Did you just make a "Will it Blend?" reference?!
0:55 lol people are still referencing will it blend
Anyone else got an ad preceding the video with Babish in it as an actor for some alcohol or something? 🤨
This honestly just makes me miss Gus. He was such a cool villain. And damn, i want to try that chicken so bad.
dude it must have taken all of  your strength to not  make a "It's time to cook" pun

If you are Christian, it’s time to spread the Gospel! Time is running out and many people will go to Hell. :)

Next week: once the crystals are formed, while wearing your face mask,  add the chili P for the signature touch.
Quarantine finally gave me the chance to watch the show and I loved it. Can't get enough of Gus Fring.
_The spices here are very commonly used in Chilean cuisine, the country from which _*_A U G U S T O - P I N O C H E T_*_ is from_
commentator : what does family taste like? broken homes ppl : 👁 👄 👁
God damn. I thought I was the only one who remembers ‘will it blend’.
3:54 Are u talking about 150 grams of water? Because water isnt measured in grams its measured in liters. It would be 150 mililiters. U are forgiven tho because americans dont use the metric system.
Am I the only one who just started watching Breaking Bad
instructions weren’t clear, i now have a bunch of meth and an rv in the desert.

hurry up with the tots episode.  GOSH!
Tasty goodness, for the chillier weather coming.
The Heisenberg of cooking
honestly that chicken looks like it's blanched in the oil not fried. try again
Looks amazing
That "Will It Blend" reference tho.
When I hear “Bangers with Babish” I think of a type of British sausage.
30g of vodka? Okay
Could you explain why you put vodka in the batter ?
I expected more breaking bad jokes. I am disappointed
Recipe's to the letter ... cooking is like science experiments for u. It's not art. What it should or should not be is up to u. It's  Basic as u put it, but after so many years of u making food for your channel a lil dash of art seems needed.  Thanks for reading

In 2012, I actually ate at the restaurant that was rebranded as “Los Pollos Hermanos” for Breaking Bad. The restaurants real name was “twisters” and is about 8 minutes from the Albuquerque HardRock Casino. They didn’t serve fried chicken though, but they did still have the Los Pollos Hermanos painted Logo on the walls inside. The place was a burger diner with a southwestern “twist”. I was stationed at Kirkland AFB in ABQ at the time and I wonder if it’s still open. If so, they really, really should start serving spicy fried chicken.
250 grams of water? Seems like ive been doing it wrong all my life
That was a really bad version of los pollos hermanos
what is the "don't breath this" in reference to? it sounds so familiar.
eww Arby’s 🤢
way too fkn smooth where's the cracklers?
I saw u added white meth blue is the key man
That chicken does not look right
So... the secret spices of Pollos Hermanos... IS FUCKING MERKÉN!?
You forgot the secret ingredient...  Crystal meth
Ok mr.white
I GOT YOUR BOTANIST AD!!
As someone who deep-fries far too much at home, I've found that a large steel pot and a spider skimmer with a bamboo handle is a good way to do it if you're worried. The one I use is an old Farberware stockpot. Still only 2 inches of oil, but it only overflows if you're doing something *very* wrong. Also, most of the splatter gets on the pot.
That has got to be the BEST looking fried chicken ive ever seen come from someones kitchen at home...damn im hungry  now lol
I cant even describe how good it is watching this after a joint...
Calling food 'no one', 'guys' etc. just drives my OCD crazy. They're things, you douche!
Cajun is kickass babish 🔥🤘🏽
You missed the meth, tho
love the blendtec reference
As an arbys fan in a seemingly arbys hating world that curly fry reference made my hour
Please do the Green Inferno.
Where is the meth bro?
Thank you
Imagine people watching this dont know what breaking bad is xD
Would’ve been better if you battered the chicken FIRST then dipped into the flour. You want that flakeyness, it holds the flavor better, more surface area.
Finally Christmas came
if you take that to a school you're going to jail
And now to garnish with a little Lilly of the Valley
this is my favourite one by far.
my mum has one of those 0:49, but its not for spices...
i cant do that recipe.  i dont have kosher salt. i have himalayan and sea salt.but no kosher. shit.
I literally just finished "Breaking Bad " today and now i see this ! What are the chances of that
The spiralizer was oddly satisfying

FRY IN A WOK!!! ITS MUCH MORE EFFICIENT!!!!
I wish los pollos was an real chain
Wonder if one could skip the deep fryng park and just cook the chiken after a 24h cure with the spice mix o:
idk... this gives me joshua weissman krispy kreme vibes..
Never clicked so fast
I once had a burger garnished with a fried Jalapeno.  I took one bite and the hot(temp) liquid from the Fried Jalepeno shot into my mouth and coated my throat.  I couldn't stop coughing for the next hour.  Not to mention it was hard to enjoy the burger with a skaulded throat.
I made instant noodles once
dude I fry in a duch oven or pasta pot , it's much better and you can account for the foaming, you want high walls. batter probs might be not cooling batter and pieces before frying...
AGANE 1:12

So u r cooking....
I'm envisioning a new 21st century latke recipe this year! Yay for me!
If he was on masterchef he would of won the championship
horseshit. The chicken in LPH is dipped in a wet batter like Korean Fried Chicken. This channel does not care about authenticity.
Can you do one on how they cook the blue stuff?
This is the first video I've had to slow down instead of 2x speed!
Might be crazy but hear me out......deep fried ham
I guess Walter would call these the 'Bomb'. Yes I know that isn't something he'd say, nor does it make sense, but give me a break
Tater tots for the win!
What about Vodka makes the batter crispy? The corn starch makes sense, but vodka??? Is it about the potato based sugars or something?
Dude I completely forgot about will it blend until you referenced it
It would be nice if he did a small breaking bad where he found a small packet of meth candy (from when he did before) after he gets the batter out of the fridge.
Anyone else keep getting the adds by babish before the video?!
As a chilean I can say that this doesn't look or taste like anything from Chile, but it's still cool af
You should do an episode with the foods from Hannibal (minus the long pig)
I'd love to see you recreate those delicious looking burritos that Tuco made when he kidnapped Walter and Jesse. 🌯😍
♡•♡ oooooooo I can't stop watching better call saul and breaking bad IM SOOOOO HAPPY I can now eat the food too!
This is recepie of poisons! You've just overcookesd and destroed the potatos and overoiled the chicken because of lower temperature... For example go to the kitchen of KFC and watch. This is not the best way but it is the good way to cook. Think about it. (sorry for mistaakes. english is not my native language at all)
Instead of laying fried foods on paper towels, use a drying rack. It keeps the food from staying soggy on the bottom
Thought the chicken was fake at first lol
Lol this was a good episode I haven’t seen one in awhile.  I see at this current moment there are 845 jerks who disliked this video. Odd since 2.4mm people have seen it and 100k liked it.  So yes - you’re jerks.
Im from Chile and we never do fried chicken WTF Gus Fring
Anything from Friends, Brooklyn 99, or Spongebob?
Always love your videos

I love the "Will It Blend" shout out! Don't breath this!
You should check out some of the Korean chicken recipes. They often feature a batter and everyone I've seen who has had Korean fried chicken has sung of it's amazing crispiness and overall amazing flavors.
when he said "its time to do the same to our chicken" at 5:00 i, for one terrifying moment, thought he was gonna spiralize the chicken
Your BlendTec reference is hilarious.
I just saw the episode again and was wondering: "Why didn't he came up with the "Meatsiah" from Bobs Burgers yet" ?

Pro tip: try using club soda in your batter instead of water.
Scared of deep frying, why ??????
I loved the Will It Blend reference! Brings back memories from the early days of YouTube.
Love how those fries are as straight as me
Learned lots of tips from this channel.  Inspired to open my own channel.  I am loving it.
Everyone raving about will it blend reference and I'm here just admiring old sponsor shoutouts
Can you confirm...   Is this the Los Pollos Hermanos Promise?
Manscaping 😂😂😂
I use a similar method when I fry chicken, but after the wet batter I give it one more toss in a dry seasoned flour and cornstarch mixture. I find it helps keep the crust on there consistently and gives it almost like an outter cracker texture.
Can I make this without the vodka? I have all the ingredients except vodka 😩
Babish, how have you not learned the waft method yet?
You need to re-make the Coffee maker from this show as well! Make Gale proud! Season 3 episode 6.
Whoa
I’ll never forget the time my brother was cooking a steak with red pepper and he burned the red pepper and my entire family was choking for 2 hours
🍗 A real chicken dinner winner
Nice
I love how in the show, they describe the chicken as “zesty”, it sounds so fucking delicious and the unique wording has always stuck with me.
Brother I've seen you so some goofy shit but that's extra lol breathing in pepper powder lol

What could I use as a substitute for vodka?

Jesus Christ is coming for His people soon brothers and sisters!!! Wake  up and look at all the evil in the world and the biblical prophecies  being fulfilled around us! REPENT of your sins and ACCEPT (confess with  your mouth and believe in your heart) our Lord Jesus Christ as YOUR  SAVIOR and receive salvation and eternal life through Him‼️ He died on  the cross and rose on the 3rd day for OUR sins! Whether you believe or  not judgment comes to all EXCEPT those who put their FAITH in Him.  Through Him we are no longer under condemnation but under GRACE! Dont  wait until its too late! God bless you all!! Amen

Big fan but I've been noticing a lot of plastic use in your recipes and was just wondering if there's a more environmentally friendly way to do things. Cheers
Really want to try this on boneless chicken.  And now there's yet another Kitchenaid attachment to hunt for. . .

What about a sort of hybrid method? Dipping the chicken in a very thin batter, letting most of the excess drip off, and then coating it in flour? I can see that working decently in place of the traditional egg wash.

Meth from Breaking Bad😃
"Now that we got our fries all fried up, it's time to do the same to our chicken" YOU'RE GOING TO SPIRALIZE THE CHICKEN?!?!?!?
I made deep frying a whole hell of a lot less terrifying by using the same volume of oil but putting it in an 8-qt stainless steel stock pot so that the oil isn't lapping at the top of the pot. Makes the sputtering and foaming a lot easier to deal with.
Reese's Thanksgiving Dinner from Malcom in the Middle! At least the the monkfish/turkey. Will help if needed!

Mark and Ethan from Unus Anus made a burger using different types of burger in McDonalds and called it the Ultimate Unus Anus burger. I would love to see you make your own version of it. 😁
good luck
next make meth
I wonder if anyone just finished watching Breaking Bad before this was uploaded.  Also I can't believe no one in the comments mentioned the "don't breathe that" reference to Will It Blend. I guess no one remembers Will It Blend, or they would certainly have let everyone know that they got the reference.
I could re-watch this show over and over for an eternity just to hear Walter yelling at Jesse😂. Absolute gem of a show.

Buy a Deep fat frier - Dedicated device for deep frying, that has a fricking thermostat to control the temperature, and thus risk of fire is minuscule - often, these days, can be run through the dishwasher, as well!
Everyday I see the breaking bad bus. The burritos are okay. Its twisters in the south valley

can you bring back the old song
I don't even cook but I watch this stuff
I like pizza
Alguna vez se han preguntado por que tenemos cortes de justicias,jueces,policias,milicia etc..? Esto es porque nos importa la justicia porque somos creados a la semejancia de un Dios justo.  Nosotros hemos pecado en su contra y roto sus leyes que tenemos en nuestras conciencias; cuando mentimos, adulteramos, robamos, somos orgullos, tenemos sexo antes del matrimonio, pornografia y muchas cosas mas, lo cual un Dios justo condenaria al igual que condenaria asesinato y violacion.  Dios es justo de condenarnos a todos pero en su amor y misericordia nos ofrece otro camino, el envio a su unico Hijo Jesus para que muriera en nuestro lugar por nuestras faltas y despues resucitara para justificarnos para todo aquel que se arrepienta de sus malos caminos y ponga su fe en Jesus sea salvo; Como un hombre que se tira de un avion y no confia en sus brazos para salvarse sino que confia en el paracaidas, asi nosotros debemos confiar en Jesus y no en nuestras buenas obras para ser salvo", porque delante de Dios nadie se va a poder justificar por su cuenta solo atravez de Jesus, por esto Jesus es el unico camino hacia Dios!

Betwixt  I love that word. I so seldom have the opportunity to use it in a sentence
0:56 mini Easter egg.  “red pepper smoke, don’t breath this”. If you notice he changes his voice to sound like the BlendTec guy.
*M O I S T*
cornstarch is what gives it that dry look on the outside. the original uses either a 50/50 mix of flour and cornstarch or just all flour
When’s the 10 million sub Meth from Breaking Bad special
"Red pepper smoke. Dont beath this" yo was that a Will it Blend reference in 2020-

I love deep frying at home, it just makes me fat and uses so much oil!
6:40 doesn't look like water from the chicken but salivating drool. LOLIMH
Instructions not clear, it iust came out as blue crystals
curly fries is what i will try to make
I JUST FINISHED BREAKING BAD LAST NIGHT WHAT PERFECT TIMING
A side note.   That water that the potatoes get soaked in, once it is cooled down to room temperature, it is great for things like adding to stews/casseroles, or even to pour over your garden patch - your garden will love it.
I wish the comments were more about the recipe and not about Babish or the channel.  (no offence Babish)

Wow! this came out when I'm on season 3 of binge watching Breaking Bad again.
Mad ‘will it blend’ reference
😂 manscape ad at 3:15 would have been perfect
I'd really like to see babish do one of the plates from Monster Hunter. The food always looks so good in those games.
can the chicken cook through like that? last time i tried frying, its crispy on the outside, RAW on the inside. Lol
I died when he said "Mother Arby's" 🤣🤣🤣
I know for a fact them white people didnt eat spicy chicken in the beginning trailer
Pros and con for chicken ???
That chicken doesn't look appetizing
The oil is bad
Was that a 'will it blend' reference? I feel like this was a 'will it blend' reference.
We can say that he A saulted that fry
Humanity has become soo advanced that we now have a machine used just to make potato strings 🤕
Did you just reference Will It Blend?
I just finished season 5 lmao
Wait , Did he just measure the water my weight?!?!?!?
I never measure the weight of ingredients , like u do that too
This episode gives me idea. How about recreating the entire menu from cluckin bell, burger shot and pizza stack from GTA SA? (Oh including the acurate presentation)
Next : How to make cocaine to sell to drug addicts
Anyone else get anxiety when he slapped all that raw chicken straight onto the wooden counter top?

I love watching your videos, but I really wish you'd give normal measurements alongside the USA units. It's very annoying having to convert everything to universal units.

When are you going to do Ed’s sauce from good burger ?
Get you a chicken that *S Q U A R T S*
If you have to deep fry over a gas burner, it's a lot safer if you use a deep pan to give more headroom. A 3/4 full pan like that is asking for trouble, since it makes it much more likely to bubble over.
Are you going to show us how to cook Blue Sky?
Why do you sound dead inside

Yo, I didn’t know that babish was sponsored by the ranch company
say no to mark of the beast, vaccines, flu shots.
i never finished this series i wish i did
Got an ad for the botanist starring babish there better not be any ads in this 😂😂
I waited 4 months for a new episode but then I saw this video on the recommended and REALIZED I WASN'T SUBSCRIBED TO THIS PROFESSIONAL CHEF
WOW !!!!! It's PERFECTLY !!  Who like this ?
I would pay my entire income to have this guy cook for me every day
I do not owe anybody anything now because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Who's here just to watch and probably won't make one?
Yooo babish sick outro music
babish is doing alot of commercials
the blendtec blender reference was the best hahaha
What was the dip he used on the fries, to me it just sounds like hes saying "french"
30 grams of vodka?? What the fuck
the most illegal thing to say in the world is grams of water
Working for him is a dream job
Wouldnt be surprised if at one point Babish raises his own chicken instead of bying it
you forgot to say how to make a chicken
you gotta make the chocolate yule log from "i'm thinking of ending things"
This... this is what i’ve been waiting for.
I've been absolutely loving this channel so much, thanks Andrew for providing us with your amazing content! And i can't get enough off Broke for Free's beautiful tunes.
EXCUSE ME BUT WAS THAT A WILL IT BLEND REFERENCE?
How the hell did I get an ad of Andrew himself on his own video
I liked the will it blend reference
Why not cook everything in acid ? You wont need to heat it up and you can just dunk everything into a plastic barrel and do an entire chicken all at once. Later you can reuse the acid if somebody doesnt like the chicken.
I like the part where he says chicken
Babish, I love you, but the fact that you don't peel of the nasty ass potato skin is infuriating
I love chicken but idk, I just feel like there are better things to cook from breaking bad. Unwatchable 1/10 sorry
Gus: *Explain yourself*
Got a Babish ad on a Babish video, I'm down. And what pencil was that in the Gin ad it looked dope!
The real restaurant which is used for Los Pollos Hermanos is a burrito place called Twisters. They don't actually serve fried chicken, but they do have curly fries, and I am pretty sure they *don't* trim them down.
I’m currently binge watching breaking bad because I’ve never seen
watching the juice drop from the chicken: 👁👄👁
So, when I put in the  methylamine?
Buy a deep fryer or air fryer!
You should have cut to Fring getting blown up in the introduction.   You missed it 😕
That Blendtec reference brought me back to a memory I never knew I had
Haha iv deep fried SOOOOOOO many things and then I got a SMALL deep fryer and deep fryer MANY more things all when TOTALLY NOT stones btw ;)..and I was never scared haha  Edit: but I did allways no where the huge thing of salt was and fire extinguisher in hallway of dorm thou haha
Frying chips in peanutoil?
Nothing inspires great cooking like a TV show about slinging crystal meth.
Ive been using your recipes and basics with babish to cook for the past couple weeks. Going to be making Pizza today so hopefully my dough rises properly 🤣 going to be making pasta soon
Don't breathe this.... No seriously don't breath it in.  This is a phrase I haven't heard in a long time
If you don’t like the curly fries, they’re on Babish! You didn’t wear the uniform? *How dare you?* An insult to the best restaurant out there
Lovely
Love Frm Pakistan
Hey Babish, You should make a food wars series, They have a lot of content you can use, and also be creative upon. The first video you made on them was 2 years ago. Hope this helps you get back up the ladder of the trending section. :)
God damn that looked good
will it blend reference caught me by surprise
These youtube algorithms are getting out of hand. I just had pollos hermanos for lunch today and didn't even tell anyone.
isn't batter fried just korean fried chicken?
Gotta love a Will It Blend reference.
"Red pepper smoke, don't breathe this!" The best throwback
"we don't want anything too thick" Well, gotta say that I disagree with you when it comes to chicks
A boy asked a girl in a library, "Do you mind if I sit next to you?" The girl replied with a loud angry voice; "I don't want to spend the night with you !! All the people in the library started looking at the boy and felt embarrassed. After a few minutes the girl walked calmly to the boy's table and said: I study psychology and I know what The man is thinking, I guess you felt embarrassed, huh? The boy replied loudly: $ 300 for one night That's too much! and all the people in the library looked at the girl in shock and the boy he whispered in her ear, "I study laws and I know how to make someone guilty ...     🤭 If you like the comment, please" write "on my channel ...

I like how babish gets fresh ingredients just to make unhealthy foods
They're supposed to be made of BAT though
Anybody else get unreasonably happy when they see the tiny whisk?
That will it blend reference though "dont breath this"
Sitting here at 3:00 AM and my mouth is watering like crazy.
I was searching for this last month aaaahh
I bet that the fries were absolutely salty. They were salted 3 times for christ sake. one from the mix, one from the chicken batter mix, and again for the finish.
Needs to be so spicy it blows half your face off.

I just finished breaking bad and el camino today, Wow the timing on this
I love you for that Will it Blend reference. Took me right back to 2010.
What are the chances I rewatch breaking bad the same week that he makes this video?
By far the best juiciest chicken, but yeah hard to get right at home.
the fries look like Jalebi!!
0:56 are you referencing Will It Blend?  I see what you did there 😏
Love the gram-ditude! Teaspoons and cups are out.
I want curly fries. Mmm.
did anyone get a Babish ad before the video?
"but first we have to make...everything".  So, grab a male chicken and a female chicken that love each other very much .........
4:21 I thought of the scene with Lalo and the frying pan from the season finale of Better Call Saul S5 when you said this
3:08 - 3:09.... "Betwixed"
Oh hey. The batter method is how we made chicken at my old job in my hometown. Locally owned chicken joint by an Italian family, we batter fried the chicken as well as a layer of corn meal and breadcrumb coating. Nice and hard and crisp and extra juicy.

Walter White looks younger and cooks food instead of meth.
I tried heating the peanut oil to 350C but it just caught fire.
Can you also teach us how to cook blue meth?
That "Will it blend" refrence was smooth 😏
During the back-of-house training at KFC, they taught us that to prevent the chicken from retaining oil inside the skin, it should always be submerged with the bone facing down. Their's is a pressure cooker filled with oil, so I'm not sure how to do this at home. Also, a pressure cooker filled with boiling oil is a bomb.
Omg omg omg YEELAGS
Can you make something from iZombie?
Out of curiosity, what do you do with the food you don't eat?

I always watch these and think "sweet!  I'll make that!" Then I think "fuck I can't make that!"  Still I binge watch every episode.
Singing with babish
This also made me learn why there are two distinct kinds of curly fries when you get them.😌 There are some really tight curls and some loser looking ones all together.
just finished watching season 3 a couple of minutes ago what are the odds ya know?
If frying at home scares you, buy a fucking deep fryer dude. Or an air fryer. Why are u rising a house fire? lol
Do They make a Human Sized Spiralizer? If I'm going into buisness, I need something to scare the competition.
Is that all you use for dip??? That’s literally only 2 frites max.
Is everything to your satisfaction!
Wow
Hey babish I know it's probably not from a show but please can you make homemade diy kinder bueno bars no one has really done it they do giant ones or don't get it right... now that Claire is gone you need to takeover the gourmet makes lmao pleaseee do it.
Fuck yeah, a tater tots episode!
"Don't breathe this" is an underutilized reference in my opinion. Thank you for using it Babs!
Instructions unclear, got half my face blown off by a pipe bomb.
Odd timing since I just finished watching Breaking Bad a few hours ago. Lbs 👌
I can't wait for the Basics with Babish:Meth episode.

Question, why is a video based around breaking bad considered kid content???
I was expecting coke to be an ingredient
Big relatable for the deep frying fears. I made "Asian Sesame-Crusted Salmon & Garlic Rice with Ginger-Soy Veggies & Pickled Onion" for dinner last night and when I cooked the veggies, the recipe was like, "Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a pan, then add the veggies and a dash of water." and I was like "??? that seems like a bad idea.. but okay....." so I did it, and- predictably- it splattered and spit EVERYWHERE. IT WENT ALL OVER THE STOVE, I WAS WORRIED IT WAS GOING TO CATCH ALIGHT BECAUSE IT LANDED ON THE BURNER AND STARTED SMOKING. All over the oven top, all over the floor. I was quietly yelling. Stress.
How to cook juicy chicken
No ingredients are ever shown yet he knows how to make the exact recipe
Make the white cake from Django Unchained.
When can we get the recipe for phosphine?
Hey Babish, saw you wearing gloves while frying. Just a heads up: Gloves are actually worse to wear while frying. You can get oil off your skin faster and easier than you can get it off a glove, and it will stick to the glove longer and just burn through and burn you longer. When I was in Culinary Arts, they would scold anyone who used gloves while frying. It just makes it more dangerous.
When are you gonna do 'The Broodwich' from ATHF?!?
“ Pollos Hermanos is the best and if you don’t like it, I’m ready to lose my face!” Literally!
Is battered chicken really uncommon there?!
I love French dressing. I love ranch dressing. I need some franch in my life.
A " Will it blend?" Reference!
did he say bags of meth at 2:08
I'll never understand cooks who are afraid of deepfrying. It's oil, not an eldritch god, just make sure to treat it respectfully, but confidently, and don't fill your pot more than about 2/3rds
Do Century soup From Toriko
Did anyone else get babish in an ad before the video

I really enjoyed the Will It Blend reference here
I want to fry at home, but to me the most daunting aspect is what to do with the oil afterwards?
tiny whisk, big squirt
napoleon! give me some of your tots!
You should make the pizza walt threw on top of the house but build a whole house thenthrow your home made pizza on top.
ok
That shroomtato made me so happy. Thank you, Babby.
As a guy who works at "Mother Arby's" we do have the best curly fries known to mankind.
literally dropped right as i finished the saga
I lost it at “mother Arby’s”
You don't know how long I waited for this.
Señor _Fring_ approves, obviously  ;-)
Do the Super Spicy Curry from FLCL, Babish!
But you can’t use vodka in Los Pollos Hermanos chicken! It’s a family establishment!
Babish I love you my guy but you gotta season that chicken heavier for an ethnic taste. What you’ve done is regrettably white

Mother Arby's would approve
Came for the “cooking” comments (:
What other spices do you add the red pepper concoction to?? Did I miss something?!😟
You should make mondo burgers with good burger sauce
DO the BROODWICH! thank you.
This feels oddly targeted to me, seeing as I just finished rewatching breaking bad earlier today.
Teenager me decided to put a pinch of ground pepper on a lit incense charcoal. Yeah. I had to stay out in the rain until it was finished burning itself out. I'm in agreement don't inhale.
I swear i remember he did this already

Hey Babish  Where are your black gloves??
Batter-fried chicken is great. Originally saw it in some Chinese recipes. And it's delicious, real light and crispy, and forms a better seal than the dry coating. It helps if you use a larger pot to fry it in though, when you need to use so much oil. Taller sides, safer and less chance of boiling over and making the mother of all messes.
I guess I conveniently wasn't paying attention when the Blendtech memes were going around bc I have absolutely zero idea what these buffoons are talking about.😂 EDIT: I'm sorry I wasted 2 mins of my life looking that up. Now I can never get that time back.
One of my uncles was deep frying fries one day. He went into his garage, forgot about the fries, and burned down half of his home. Needless to say, he no longer deep fries anything lol.
I always wondered why a fried chicken is so juicy inside. Glad this video found me.
That blendtec reference was perfect
I’ve been waiting for this episode

Imagine deep frying with a wok.  I don't personally do it, but I've helped deep fry fries and chicken drumsticks. It's not exactly stable since a wok is round, so it scares the living hell outta me when the wok tilts.
Cumin, smoked red pepper flakes (merken), pepper,  and garlic would  be more chilean. I love your channel, greetings from Chile.
This makes me miss Breaking Bad
When he gonna cook Walt's recipe?
Finish the show yesterday, a pleasure
Thought that was an actual ad
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates✌️Non-Duality
Who else felt the oil level was to high for that pan? I was nervous for him.
"Is the food to your satisfaction?" -Gus
✨✨✨✨✨
*Mother Arby's*
I know it was a front but I still question the economics of vodka in chicken batter in a fast food joint.
you and gordon ramsey are the reason I want to be a chef thank you for what you do
Vodka? Do ya think we can use Vinegar instead?
Wouldn't it make more sense cutting the fries as they're  coming off the peeler and falling into the hot water?
Love ya Bab's. Fun fact, almost all crushed red pepper flake is made from cayenne dried chilis.
He can never resist taking a regretful whiff of that spice cloud.
Make the peanut chicken soo peanuty u wont even taste the chicken!  (From pheanis and ferb)
I like how the measurements are  in grams... keep it going! Buy a scale haters!!!
Don't breathe this🤣😂😆😂🤣😂🤣😂😆
If deep frying at home scares you, you're doing it fucking wrong. Why is your pan so shallow? You're just asking for shit to go wrong.
Those curly fries looked simply divine! So thin and crispy! Mouth watering through the screen! 😍🤤
Is it ok if I use regular French fries instead of curly fries? Asking for a friend...
that freeze frame chicken juice kinda looked like snot, gross XD
Amazes me how he has shit like a potato spiraller. Something hes used about twice in the show. But not a deep frier when he deep fries something almost every episode
That freeze-frame chicken squirt is uh, not great man.
Don't breathe this - Tom Dickinson 2009
Booo Yeaahhhh !    TIGHT !! TIGHT !!! TIGHT !!!!
"Red pepper smoke - don't breath this, seriously"  LMAO oh my god. That brought back memories of working at the Crown Casino here in Melbourne, in their kitchens, and being the poor Dishie/Steward to have to clean out all of the thousand or so little dishes of sweet chilli sauce after an event. Literally working by touch and trying not to breathe or get the steam in my eyes! 🤣
Pollos
This is the only media-based recipe I have ever wanted.
Double dip method (flour,batterx2)and the frying problem it’s gone.
The most accurate part of the video is how those spices are as chilean common use as Gus is chilean
Please be my father.
Sorry just had to be the 500 th dislike
Hey Babish, if you ever want to smoke weed... I got you homie.
All hail Mother Arbys!
I swear that that you remember every single food mentioned in any show. I knew that Gus ran Pollos Hermanos, but completely forgot the specifics
You should make the sandvich from team fortress 2
As much as I appreciate your recipe style and variety, the metric measures art not in my lexicon, by intent. Therefore I'm unsubbing because I can't repeat your finesse while trying the conversions. Ziiiip-beeeeeep, end of recording.
Use Gin instead of vodka in the batter and make the best fish and chips of your life.   Had it in Dingle Ireland with Dingle Gin.
Anyone else disappointed he wore gloves to toss the fries?
Chilean cuisine is oregano, salt, cumin, paprika!!!!! thats the classic aliño chileno c:
Man you mix the systems, you use grams but then you say the temps in °F.
If deep frying with oil terrifies you (me too) deep fry in a deeper pot like a dutch oven there's less splatter and easier clean up.
People who like this are before 2M Views.
Yay
You can always fry in the dutch oven, which has a much higher side and would prevent oil splatter?
will it blend? that is the question!
Yes "Tiny Wisk"!!!! I love Tiny Wisk, to match your so cool tattoo on your arm!
reminds me of Roy Rogers fried chicken back in 80's it had that great shell on it like that
Can you do the egg sandwiches from Beastars?
Los Culos Hermanos
You can't be afraid when frying, the oil can sense fear. Guessing Babish never worked food service enough or at all. Can't call yourself a chef and talk about being afraid of frying.
I literally just finished watching breaking bad TODAY. What perfect timing lmao
I'm hungry now, I'm not trying wait up to 24 hours for chicken. If it ain't something I can't fix within a hour or at least in the same day I ain't cooking it.

Babish saucier??
can someone confrirm to me there are no spoilers because im watching ti now
As a Dutch guy, it strikes me as odd that you guys across the pond always preface deep frying as some super dangerous thing normally not done in a home kitchen. Basically every family I know has a deep fryer or a pan of rotating oil for expressly this purpose. See oliebollen and frikadel for common usage.
Turn the kitchen to a laboratory
Adding cayenne and no Chef John mention. Pay your damn respects Andrew
damn it, you always make me hungry.
Heart my comment >;c
You're right to show respect to hot fry oil. But why wouldn't you use a deeper pot?  Even for the potatoes, a Dutch Oven or something deeper than a fry pan would add a HUGE margin of safety. Plus more metal = more heat retention. Although deeper pot = harder camera angle. But if your house burns down, it's a moot point.
Ok now do Walt's potroast
You must have a sink full of little bowls when you're done with one of these
Highly disappointed in you.  Tiny whisk until...combined?  No no no!  Tiny whisk until homogeneous.  I feel robbed of your line.  I LIVE FOR HOMOGENEITY!!!

Both pans were way too shallow for deep frying.  That was scary.
Why is it always kosher salt? Is he Jewish?
Nice 'Will It Blend?' reference, lol!
The oil level in that stainless steel pan was way too high. Try frying in one of your fancy dutch ovens for a less death-defying experience? Oh well, at least you didn't put ricin in it I guess 😂
The oil to cooking vessel ratio in this video is going to make me lose sleep... USE A 6 QT CAST IRON DUTCH OVEN, AND DON'T FILL IT MORE THAN 1/3RD TO 1/2 OF THE WAY UP THE VESSELL!!!!!! Outside that can't wait to try this one and add it to my ever-expanding list of great Babish recipes!

Why do you not use a large shallow pan if you're afraid of frying at home?
I'm terrified of frying food at home but that looked awesome.
it's like how similarly colored colorscheme fastfood restaurants are supposed to be:  fresh and clean chicken , size consistent, fries done right with care and GuSto  employees are supposed to be.. friendly and moves with purpose and initiative  employees are compensated better and are motivated to be part of the entire business  and managers who have the darksaber and know Mike
Curly fries for the win.... but anyone else excited for tater tots?  I know I am!

Oh lord, the hoarseness when you said "Tiny whisk to combine" Y'allright babish? Didn't huff too much red pepper did you?
The show made me question every checken selling franchise, specially  el pollo loco, and pollo campero.
Oh chickens from los pollos hermanos are tight!
Finally
Dang
I was very close to an anxiety attack watching you lower that chicken into the oil with like an inch of free space. For both of our health please use like a 50% full dutch oven next time.
As a Chilean, I gotta say that you wouldn't be able to find Cayenne pepper at a supermarket if your life depended on it. Love your videos BwB, I'll try fixing up some of that chicken here in Chile.
Please please please do a video on the broodwich from Aqua Teen Hunger Force!

So many channels go the wrong way when they get too successful. Not the case here. Babbish has aged like a fine scotch. Classy, smooth, and geting better every year.

I love the Blendtec reference earlier in this video.
Thx for the recipe but it would be thousand times great if you dressed like Gus while cooking 😆
Dude!  That thumbnail picture is so perfect it almost looks fake :).
hey Babish! Just wondering if you had the chance to try los pollos hermanos through uber eats? I've been wanting to get down to LA and try. Would love to know what you think if you have.
I can’t believe he forgot to put in the meth bags
Those fries looked so delicious
Did I just hear a Blendtec reference in 2020? Bringing up memories I forgot I had
I'm too lazy to make this for myself, where can I order ?
1:35 algun Chileno por aqui que ocupe esas especias... por que yo lo soy y no recuerdo haber visto red pepper flakes en concepción. merken te creo po.
This is the third time i have heard a "don't breathe this" reference in about a week. My brother was sanding cement board for some repairs and i said it two days ago lol. Up in the zeitgeist once again.
Haha, Will It Blend.  I, too, was here for early YouTube.
babish I ficking love you

That chicken is not that juicy if it was cooked to 165 degrees
I hadn't watched the series until 2 weeks ago and I'm on season 4 just as this episode came out. Some coincidental timing yo
I wish the fries from twisters were actually that good :(
Request to do a Cowboy Bebop session 2
Babish please do the chicken mole or Reuben from "House MD"
*Makes curly fries* Mentions Arbys instead of Jack in the Box. *Texan intensifies.* Y'ALL
So much drool.
Bruh I just started watching Breaking Bad last week this is awesome!
His chicken is the bomb
Did anyone else feel like the first bit was unfocused or is it just me...
Have you seen the guy doing the will it sausage series
Ok im glad u explained why u used boiling water, i just used cold water and let them sit for a bit. I try next time Also, get a hand powered curly fry maker, youll get nice size curly fries!
Still gotta think about a loose batter to hide some Blue Meth.
Next episode: How to perfectly throw a pizza onto the roof.
And what is Aleppo ?
This would probably work with some tofu right. Would it make any difference if its covered or not in fridge while dry brine is on it?
Somehow Babish always posts something related to whatever I’ve been watching that week😳
Will it Babish? That is the question.
HEY EVERYONE GO WATCH BETTER CALL SAUL IT'S BETTER THAN BREAKING BAD
"Jesse! It's time to cook!"  "we just have to watch this BwB video, mr. White! It won't make meth, but I think we can make more money like this."
I, too, find myself subject to antics.
Nice blendtec reference.
Wait. Tater Tots you say? Do not delay.
"don't breathe this, it hurts your lungs" Everyone on the west coast: first time?
"Mother Arby's" made me laugh harder than it probably should have...
You need to make meatloaf from phineas and ferb!!
What do you do with all that oil?
I got a babish ad on this video
Just do the milkshake with laxatives from The iron giant already
My life will not be complete until I see Babish do a salt bae impression!
I'm sorry, was that a "will it blend" reference!?
Come to think of it you kinda look like Walter White
next episode: triple decker ice cream sandwich
He left the drumstick unfinished. Game's weak
Yes spice In the batter !
"Don't breathe this" was that a will it blend reference?
I came here just to read all the crystal meth jokes
Why don't YouTube chefs just buy a mini deep fryer? You could probably get one for under 60 bucks.
you should make a Crunt from Tuca and Bertie
why do you measure in grams instead of table spoons or cups?
🇨🇱🇨🇱 Merkén seasoning 👌🏼
0:53 babish hitting those old school memes!! Love it.
Scary that the commercial is so accurate lol
you should cook meth from breaking bad
Random question that I got form looking at the video: can you use pancake batter as a batter for chicken?
The Will It Blend references are vintage YouTube.
Dude made chicken so good it nutted on him
Excuse me but did this man just say the tater tot episode??
Love the Will it Blend reference <3
Wow, a Blendtec reference and Breaking Bad? Babish is really taking us back to 2008 with this one!
A Babish provides.
you need a spider scoop, helps with the fried foods
Very brave frying in shallow pans. Better to just do in a big pot for safety reasons.
I always enjoy the "Will it Blend?" references and I ESPECIALLY love the SteveMRE shout outs....I liken it to when your favorite comic books have a crossover event!
never EVER fill your deep frying pan more than half way up. A much bigger pan was needed here
Spiralizer sounds like a band name
I hope someone else gets the “don’t breathe this” reference - all the way back from the Will It Blend channel
(Looks at a Pollos Hermanos fried chicken) Me: YOU, ARE, MINE.
a dry brine, or a "dryne", if you will
Did anyone get the early Blendtec reference? Good old one!
Yuuuup I was home frying once in a dummy way and now I got a scar on my arm from a second degree burn lol. Be careful !
just watched spike lee’s do the right thing for the first time. Gus who I saw lol
where's the meth?
Are you doing Napoleon Dynamite's tater tots next?
If you wanted Chilean spices, you should have used Merken! I don't know how you can get it over there
HE SAID CHILE AAAAAAAHHHHHH CTM
Andy my man, you have got to make Lalo’s Tacos from Better Call Saul
POLLOS
Do you like to some one cut part of your body ,an arm or leg,season, fried, and eat?  Right,,
Hello Babish bud. I am trying to find what the 10th piece of chicken is.  Is it leg,thigh,wing, and breast cut in half ?
That most elusive of side dishes....meth.
Those overfilled oil pans had my heart in my throat and my ass on the edge of my seat. It looked great on camera but why not use a deeper pan!
Why kill an animals or 🐦 birds to eat?? And   add flavors on they skin to blame the animal flavor after eat.. gross ..
What timing! Just got up to 'Ozymandias' last night on my re-watch (and SO's first watch) of BB!  Science, Bitch!
"vodka" in fry chicken? ehh
6:06 Tiny whisk don't lie???
Is there a method of baking for this? I am not a fan of oil like that
I'm just here for the "will it blend" deep cuts
I have to watch each new video twice, as once im home from school his lovely voice lulls me to sleep so i must watch the video again once i am awake
Why didn’t you use the same batter for both of them? As I assume any real restaurant would  You know fast food places love to cut corners
I always thought this recipe looked like Church's chicken. And considering how juicy it was, I'm gonna say this is close. I need to try this recipe. I love Church's but there aren't any near me.
Will it blend? That is the question.
I am Chilean and this is not Chilean
Tbh this is not the recipe I wanted from Los Pollos Hermanos, but seems pretty good!
This is the episode I was waiting for...
0:55 who got the reference to Blendtec's Will It Blend? Oh the memories
Just in time, I just finished watching the whole show + movie!
how many soyboys are watching this, mouth-agape right now
My mouth is watering now. It looks so delicious
Curley fries look so good!  The music playing while you’re talking, although soft, serves no purpose except to distract from your commentary.
Oot looks fu. to eat them uncut
mr bing where is my 20000 km/h of chicken wigs
I've never clicked a Babish video so fast in my life.
Did anyone else get THE PERFECT AD  aka the Hidden Valley x Binging with Babish Ranch ad
0:55 that 'will it blend?' joke got me harder than it should have 😂
I wonder if this pairs well with the meth candy?
"deep frying at home scares the shit out of me" - and yet you basically wear a safety hazard when handling with extremly hot things: disposable gloves. imagine those melting on your skin.
Why don't you have a hitech deep fryer?
From which Gustavo (Last Name) comes
Wasn't expecting a blendtec reference today, but thank you
T H I C C
Im taking away your steam account mr white
Yum!!!
"Spice grinder". Yes. "Spice".
WHY WAS BABISH IN AN AD BEOFRE THE VIDEO STARTED IM GOINFKSHDKDNDKD
Anyone else think he should make the heavy’s sandvich from tf2
I've said this on every single one of your videos and I plan to keep saying it until you finally do it. Pleeeease make Rich's kettlecorn from community!!!
Imo, jack in the box has better curlies.
Why is this trending??
Love the channel! I wish you would do a sushi episode, especially after hearing you mention tempura. Good stuff!
What, no all-crisp?
I can wholeheartedly say I register at least 165 on the white meat register. I can’t dunk worth a darn.
How come Babish doesn't use a wok for deep frying?
Ahh why am I watching this in the middle of night
The “will it blend” reference cleared my skin and watered my crops, my life is anew
Can you make chocolate croissants from Its Complicated
I wonder if Los Pollos Hermanos was inspired by Pollo Campero...
"a most unusual method of frying chicken"   all of south korea: "am i a joke to you?"
Better Call Saul
Can you pleaseeeee do the pork cutlet bowl from yuri on ice?
Jesse look       I cooked Pollos Hermanos
Do the ramen from naruto shippuden
I had completely forgotten about Will It Blend lmao
Do the fried chicken sundae from south park
I pray everyone who sees this live long.
For more authenticity, Giancarlo Esposito should really be there watching him clean the kitchen for hours.
Whoever is reading this, I hope you become rich and successful, go chase your dreams           My dream is to hit 1k please help me reach it❤️❤️
It feels amazing knowing that there is someone else that is wary of the dangers of hot frying oil at home! I get the weirdest looks when I tell people that. Similar to how a wood turning lathe is quite deadly if something goes wrong compared to a bandsaw yet more people are afraid of the bandsaw than the lathe....
Could you cut the potato as its coming out of the spiraler thing to shorten them
Oh I am definitely selling some one a bag of magic potatoes
Hey man, learn to use cloth towels for some things. Some potato starch isn't going to kill you
*Buying a whole chicken and break it down, added to my bucket list.*
Babish: Has tongs Also Babish: *uses hands*
Is this recipe can modified?
What's a good alternative to peanuts oil if you're allergic to peanuts...? Like I am....
My guy you dont have a Dutch oven or big ass pot thats why you use and a fry hoodie helps alot the grease won't hit yah as bad
Never miss to tiny whisk your spices
No slo-mo zoom in on the chicken squirt?
I've heard back it for 25-30 minutes, but in the fridge for FOUR TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS
Every time he says tiny whisk a little voice in my head says _Lil Bitsssss_
Babish: "These spices are tipically used in chilean cuisine" Me, a chilean: "they are?"
Didn’t season the chicken well enough either
i am the one who knocks
Guacamole hat from Despicable Me!!!!!
I’ve had pollos Hermanos in real life. The curly fries were pretty good. (There was a pop up)
Next video: "Homemade Crystal Meth from Breaking Bad, but better"
Why must you use alcohol im 15 but want to use your recipes
Weird question, how do you clean your spice grinder?
Ok but what is the "green cajun kickass stuff"?
@binging with babish can you do Travis Scott burger from McDonald’s please
THANK YOU for supporting my argument for Arby's curly fries. I will be referencing this video every time I have the debate from now on.
Incorrect recipe, forgot the crystal meth
Yo, could you do the ‘Blues Brothers’ Diner Order?
YOU SHOULD MAKE POLLO CAMPERO TYPE CHICKEN PLEASE
So are you still going to do the Ed’s sauce?
I dont know how but this guy's whole milieu and mood turned total douchebag.
As a black man that cooks for himself,  I say that i am Immune to the inevitable splatter of hot cooking oil. My body has long since become accustomed to the pain.
My friend and I love your videos and he wanted to ask you if you could make the Travis Scott burger from McDonalds but didn’t have enough courage so I told him I’d ask
2:45 !! LOL, potatoes turns into mushroom
Idea for a future episode: Food eaten and prepared by Charles Boyle from Brooklyn nine nine. Stuff like a whole songbird, Ox hooves and anything gastro-sensuous.
He already made the meth, not he just needs to pack them in to them chicken containers.
Ah, yes, the joy of inhaling freshly ground hot spices. I know it better than I care to admit...
I don't think that we use Cayenne or Aleppo that much in Chile, but it's okay, at least we made it to Breaking Bad you know? viva Chile I guess
Why do Americans still insist on the "vessel of fiery death" method of frying? Why not just buy a deep fryer? Even a top brand one costs only a couple dozen dollars.
Pollo Terro rita
WILL YOU PLEASE MAKE FINGER BLASTERS
Osh, this looks like shit. Quan can do better
mmm... tot's
1:33 As a chilean, those spices aren't exactly common here lol
NICE :-)
Buy a deep fat fryer
Can you do the lunch scene from Twister?
No one else saw the Babish ad? Nice flex
I fell asleep to his voice
Would love to see your take on the Unus Annus burger. Would make a cool crossover.
that thumbnail was peng
youtube -  "creators cant talk about anything political, guns or even swear or they will be demonitized, For the children!" Babish - literally talks about hiding meth in chicken, youtube - trending...
Another awesome video, thank you!
Just finished watching breaking bad for the first time yesterday
Los pollos obamos
That show made alot of people relapse Congrats my dude on the chicken
"...But we can do better. First, we will start by making our own meth."
2 shots of vodka
It's been a hot minute since I ever thought about Will It Blend?
I miss breaking bad! 😭😭😭
So, you assume we all have a $400 stand-mixer, but not a $40 deep-fryer?
wow the blendtec reference hit hard..
YouTube should just have commercials with these non skippable ads
NORISUKE'S FRUIT PARFAIT RECIPE FROM JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE JOJOLION PLEASE
“Chicken Brothers” 🙃
"Vat of Death"  "Hot Tub of Doom"  [Adam Ragusea has entered the chat]
I wanna see you make a homemade chicken next time BABISH....
Make “Hair Cake” you coward!
Deep frying at home is nothing to be afraid of. As long as you use a big ass stock pot filled about a 3rd of the way with oil, maybe if you use a short ass cast iron pan that could accidentally be flipped and spilled all over yourself. I've gotten many minor 1st degree burns from splashing oil and it's never a big deal as long as you quickly run cold water over it
To the person that’s reading this:  You’re very intelligent and adorable human! Stay healthy during quarantine 🎵💨 My dream is to hit 6K I am struggling to get there 🥰💞...
I want a video on the Broodwhich from Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Next video: Gale's Coffee
Can you make the order from the La Vie Boheme number in the musical Rent?
I just bought chicken legs...and I saw this notification just now. I guess I know what's for dinner now.
Can you do La Bombe from the Simpson’s episode “look whos coming to dinner”
Nice
This gave me aniexty watching frying in shallow pans
Question: What happens with the food that we don't see you consume, now im going to assume that it does in fact get eaten. Your answer below.
I JUST FOUND YOUR HIDDEN VALLEY RANCH COMMERCIAL
I thought raw chicken on a wood cutting board was a big no-no.
Love the “Will it blend?” reference.
I cackled at "mother arbys"
Do...do people not normally batter their chicken when they fry it. Is this a northern thing I'm to southern to understand?
MISSISSIPPI Queen is still on my Hit Parade
Gotta make sure you can get out that Meth ya know 😂 that's the most important part of making chicken of course
I want someone to watch this who hasn’t seen breaking bad
thats perfect chicken...lol
i just got finished watching breaking bad literally 3 minutes ago. what the hell?
I know you live in an area of the world, in the baron wasteland without jack in the box (the king of fast food) but jack in the box curly fries are way better than Arby’s but Arby’s are a good baseline that everyone is familiar with.
Another predator getting away with R@PE! While making fcking chicken
Whose binge watching both Breaking bad and Babish in quarantine? :D
Why do you always breathe is the hot pepper powders? Like have you not learned yet to not do that?? Lol
I wasn’t paying attention to the beginning and I legit thought that was an ad for something playing lol
This is the second recipe this week I've seen with Aleppo pepper... never heard of it before! I guess I better get to cooking
Gus-"Sir, if you have a complaint I suggest you submit it to our email system, I'd be happy to refer you to our website."
It'd be cool if you made yashiro's  monster veggie bento from toilet bound hanako kun
Bext episode: from undertale you should make spider cider and the spider donut
Make the tf2 sandvitch
Got an add with babbish in it and thought it was part of the video
Please tell me the tater tots episode will be based on Napoleon Dynamite!
Funny the commercial got recommended to a lot of people by the YT algorithm like a week ago
Make the sandvich from the Steam game, Team Fortress 2.
Church's Chicken 😒😒😒
Make the mexican popcorn like goofball said
Jesse...We have to cook.
you don't put meth in there right?
Hey can you show us how to make the pollos hermanos
been doing his over a year. One Piece!
frillier larrups
This is excellent man!  LOL I friggin love your content
OMG ITS HERE!!!!!
You should do a massive food thing like lotr type, and do a collaboration with Matt stonie.. it would be awesome lol
When you are Chilean and never have heard of those spices before
Don’t mind me. Just here to help the algorithm.
I wanted to try that chicken so bad
Siq
Every chicken and egg you eat lived a life of unimaginable horror.Fight Factory farming.
What is aleppo pepper?
Taters?!👀
Holy moly. We started rewatching BB last week 🤯
I just finished binging the series with my parents for the second time, Gus will forever be my favorite character.
At Los Pollos Hermanos all chickens are head sliced?! ... 😀 🔥
Fucking finally!!!
Invoking the chant of the ancient memes. The YouTube elders are pleased.
Take a taste of my new curly 🍟, Gustavo in Better Call Saul lol?! ... 😀 🔥
Finally the vid we've all been waiting, where Babish teach us how to cook meth! yay!
I got a suggestion for a video. Dusty's chicken from Paradise PD 😂
YOOOO I JUST GOT YOUR BOTANIST AD FOR ALCOHOL🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽 looks good and all but... I’m only 14 :/ MARK MY WORDS IM TRYING IT WHEN IM OLDER
"Don't breathe this" he says, as the AQI has been 150+ for weeks.
"mother arby's curly fries" lol I see you've never had Rally's
jedse you burn rv with wrong ingrediemt??!
every time I watch babish he has a new kitchen I swear
Anyome else get his ad for The Botanist before the video? Looked great Andrew!
I finished breaking bad literally yesterday (for the first time in my life) and you posted this! Whaaaa
mr walter i require methè
I'm honestly embarrassed at how hard I laughed at the Potato Mushroom.
Why do you say "grams" and not teaspoons and tablespoons? we don't use the metric system in America and it makes it hard to understand what you mean
I haven't heard the "don't breathe this" in forever.
finally
I'm Brazilian but trully chilean chicken would have merken hehe jokes aside do give it a try it is soooo good!!
Say my name
I'm Chilean and I've never used or even seen coriander seeds xd
There's a pollos Hermanos chicken delivery restaurant here in LA I've been tempted to try
You know you’ve made it when people can get an ad you made before your own video. Never had the botanist but now I want to try it
Man I wish I could get some meals made for me
*brain whisper* "the spice... Melange..."
wow the chicken looks like jollibee's chickenjoy
^
Don't leave any box cutters near by
season the flour not the chicken
I a chilean can confirm that those spices are used here
Lmao
I'm craving fried chicken so bad holy shit
I'm gonna eat the screen
"...short and curlies."  So we're just done with phrasing?
arcane af
Man I've always wondered how family tastes like.
No meth?
That little "don't breathe this" from will it blend sent me into a Manchurian candidate trance of memories and nostalgia
Watching this at midnight made me hungry af
can you make Steven Universe together breakfast?
Idea heavys sandvich form tf2
Rat Burger, Demolition Man
Do Rocky Mountain oysters from  “The Office”
DIJO CHILE
Babish - 30 grams of vodka me - wait what... niiice.
Anyone else get a Botanist add featuring Babish before the video started? 😂
Can you make a video about Danishs
not a fan of peanut oil,makes me sick to my stomach,not sure why.
Should try the mushrooms au gratin from The Misfit of Demon King Academy
Do the broodwich from Aqua Teen Hunger Force
poggers
yum!
How about 'chicken of the cave' from Anchorman (2)?
Now do meth.
JUUUUUUUUUUUCY!
Curious why the cast iron pain over a dutch oven.  Just easier to shoot?   I would think way more forgiving as far as fryer fire hazard.
Still one of the best tv bad guys of all time.
ok now show us your recipe for meth.
Babish whipping up that WAP (wet ass phried chicken)
Definitely rewatching breaking bad
Here we have kfc
I would kill to see babish and coryxkenshin do a cooking collaboration
Nice to know that frying at home also scares the heck out of Andy.  It absolutely terrifies me.
Next episode will be the gus fring special
Cool video!
We have a place called Pollos Camperos here and the batter looks just like that. Is so good plus they have awesome empanadas and yucca fries.
Now you must make Blake's burgers - the best burger in Albuquerque and the only one shown on Breaking Bad. If you go the green chile cheeseburger route you have to use Hatch and make them in New mexico.
Best episode hands down Walter white my boy
Ooo boi I've been waiting for this!
"Hey brother..." -Buster Bluth Gob's 'chicken dance'. BB got a lot of inspiration from Arrested Development!
I finally learned how curly fries are made!
People who dislike this video are the kinds of people who give one star reviews to tv shows they’ve never watched.
I even said this guy’s channel picture looks like Walter white
Will it blend?
I drink your mushroom top.
You should've worn a yellow Hazmat suit for extra points
It looks like deep fried brain
0:56 Incredible Will it Blend reference.
next make the travis scott burger
I am the one who cooks
Can you plz do a monster hunter ice born meal plzzzzzzzzzz
Ed sauce now
That part where babish interrupts the video showing him assembling a meth lab and showing all the chemicals to cook meth really puts a chill down my spine.
Hold up fry the potatoe mushrooms whit some dip one cheazz other sour cream and onion you got some nfl super bowl snacks
Part of this process used paper towels and yet this video was not sponsored by a certain paper towel company. I feel like that was a missed opportunity for you.
That's a lot of spicy p!
Cant wait for some of them "let me get some of your tots" classics!
Chili P?
0:54 I got that reference
You should do the foods from the opening sequence of Napoleon Dynamite but the Babish Way
Open a restaurant I will line up for this shit
Make unus annus burger.
I literally just started rewatching breaking bad yesterday. What a pleasant coincidence
1:35 People barely getting introduced to gustavo in the show: Say sike right now
"Deep frying things at home scares me like everybody" Me, a Belgian, where 8/10 families own a deep fryer: wait what
Why don’t you use an air fryer?
The Botanist commercial was amazing
Try some foods from The Goldbergs, I'm intrigued by them
Shit, Im all nostalgic for blendtec now.
Chilean spices are usually, Coriander, merkén (Smoked chilli), oregano, cumin and paprika :) Those chicken needs cumin and a little bit of garlic to be  r e a l  chilean food. Great video tkm.
0:55 Nice nod to "Will it Blend?"
ordinary sausage
do you like the botanist?
Pretty pale chicken crust
Should’ve compared it to the real life counterpart! The restaurants are real but it’s another name
i think i'd actually prefer andrew's fries more than arby's O.o
I feel like this the episode I’ve been waiting for, but never knew I was waiting for until today. 😭😭😭
Now do a whole unsliced pizza so you can throw it on a roof.
FINALLY
"Don't breathe this." -Tom

Double fry them extra crispy yummm
I got an ad of the botanist done by babish while watching this
Can you please do some of the crazy meals and or jelly from Eddie's Million Dollar Cookoff please!!!!!!!
Measuring in grams never seemed so appropriate.
Ive been waiting for this, been binge watching it again
"A little bit of salt" takes at least a fistfull
Can you come over and cook for me?
Fuck I love being betwixed stuff! 🥰
Gusa had sad in one episode that he added lime and cayenne to his fried chicken to adhere to more Mexican tastes.
What's this? A Will It Blend reference in my 2020?
Travis Scott burger
you should make "the sauce" from new girl. please.
Babish Salamanca 💅
Frying at home is easy just really messy
Los Pollos Hermanos is a beloved New Mexico staple, and as such, they certainly use New Mexico Red Chile Powder in their seasoning mix!
You should try Sloppy Waffles from Sam&Cat. It's my little sister's idea.
Please do foods from the amazing world of gumball such as the mcguffin(the secret burger), the sluzze dog, The perfect meal, Gumball sandwich (ketchup and syrup sandwich), The organic pizza or the joyful burger.
cool i want that spiralizer just to make the shroom fries.
It isnt that odd to fry chicken in batter!  We do it at my restaurant @birdnbarrel .
Do you have a dutch oven for deep frying? The high walls makes it a little safer 😂
Bruh...  Watching BB and when i saw this ad I was legit sad  Pollos Hermanos did not exist... SOOOO happy to see you make a run on it!
He didn’t use the los pollos Hermanos Commercial😥
Only real ones know "Don't Breath This"
CHILEEEEEE
You should’ve cooked this in a yellow jumpsuit and a breathing respirator
FINALLY LOS POLLOS HERMANOS
Nononononono I know you turn your contrast up so colors are more vibrant but that chicken was lighter than my ass put that back in there
With Breaking Bad, will we learn to make meth?
Do Toastpoints from limitless!!
He should have cooked with a lab coat on
Finally
the height of the oil in that pan frying the chicken made me so nervous.
chicken looks raw inside
“Is this Acceptable to you?”
Tight tight tight
Ey Yo! Mr White! Check this video out. It's bomb yo!
That first bite was so good he made the chicken cry
Did anyone else get a Babish ad with this video 🤯🤩🤩🤩🤩
Honestly confused as to why the spice blend doesn't include something like ají amarillo or New Mexican chile powder, instead of cayenne/aleppo.
Overnight salad form snl
Yooo this just gave me nostalgia
YEES
Just made battered fried chicken last night. So greasy but so good.
You og for the blendtech ref. !!
Lmao the blentec reference made me die
6:40 unfortunate picture because it looks like something is coming out of your nose :D
BABISH BABISH BABISH BABISH BABISH BABISH BABISH BABISH BABISH
Watched the ad for the botanist
Banish girl: comeover Babish: no I'm cooking Her: I have kosher salt Him:.......          I'm on my way
Vanish went from HAVING commercials, to BEING his own damn commercial sponsor...THAT is baller AF
Can you make Oily Cakes from First Cow?
I would love to see all of Monica's mockolate recipes from friends. I always wondered what the hell mockolate was made of
I’ve been waiting for this video for so long 😭
Babish I love you
I'm from Albuquerque and I love twisters (the real Los pollos) . No fried chicken there, but they have curly fries, they just don't have that seasoning on them
My favorite show :D
Babish, please whisper "betwixed" into my ear...
Interesting first time im binging breaking bad and then this.
Monkfish turkey from malcolm in the middle
Underrated "will it blend" reference
The Will It Blend reference was fairly enjoyable.
It will never be okay to me to measure liquids in grams.
Manscaped lol
Aleppo pepper? Coriander seeds? Vodka instead of pisco? Being chilean, I'm very pissed off with the condiments choices
YESSS FINALLLYYYY
MAKE THE UNUS ANNUS BURGER!!!!
Babish curly fries vs Joshua Weissman curly fries Comment who you think would win
3:17 Babish, the Vasectomist
You forgot to eat the rest of the chicken left on the bottom of the leg...
that "don't breathe this" really brought me back. wow
wow...a few simple references...n the whole nerd community lumbers outa the basement... ...fried chicken didn't help
I got an ad for The Botanist and Babish was there lol
"Binging Breaking Bad with Babish"
agane
Don't breathe this. Classic youtube. Will it blend.
Do dessert dogs from The Simpsons next 🙏🙏🙏
존나 먹어보고싶다
What in the world do you do with all that leftover oil?
How you gonna mention Arby's but not Jack in the Box?
Nothing like getting a babish commercial before a babish video
Honestly, I like the sound of a juicy fried chicken. Hope I get to try it sometime.  Never gonna fry shit at home though; with my luck, I'll somehow end up faceplanting that oil. I may not be a pretty man, but I sure don't need to get uglier.
"time to grab some scissors and do a little manscaping" -Babish pls never change
Do some chilean recipes dude, make empanadas de pino, in the 18th of September we eat them for our independence day in Chile
jesse, we need to cook
THAT BLENDTEC REFERENCE THOUGH I-
Is there a basics with babish for frying and left over oil??
Please make 99 cheese pizza from tmnt btw ily
Love the “will it blend” reference
So yummy!!
Can't wait for the tater tots episode. I want to see the green kick ass sauce to!
We later found Babish’s head mounted on top of a tortoise in the middle of nowhere
0/10, was not served with a smile.
Yooooo I just got a commercial with baddie babish while waiting for a babish video
Watching this when you're broke and hungry is torture
I got a binging with babish ad for alcohol on this video wha
I got hit by your Youtube ad Babish... "Uww, that's a good ad"
What does he do with all the oil after that?
Gus fring is best
I'm pretty sure the Arby's curly fries have some kind of parboil going on - they have that kind of beat up exterior that creates all the crunch. I bet if you parboil and then kinda shake 'em up between two big metal bowls before frying, you'd achieve something similar to Arbys
Genuinely disappointed Andrew didn’t wear the Los Pollos Hermanos staff uniform
the hot dog place is called the dog house and has been here in burque for 40+ years. I live like two blocks from where they filmed the pollo hermanos (its called twisters ) and i dont think ive ever seen the employees smile in that place like in the commercial on the show
it’s official. ARBYS FRIES ARE THE BEST
We need to make this Babish’s most liked video
When Gus saw this video. It blew his mind
seeing gus smiling only brings back the box cutter scene 😬😬😬
He doesn’t recommend the chicken but I can’t help but want to make this because what can go wrong with really juicy and crispy fried chicken!
I mean, TECHNICALLY chicken isn't usually batter-fried, but is there really any difference alternating between dipping in flour and a milk-egg mixture? that's just a batter with extra steps.
"The spices here are very commonly used in Chilean cuisine."  Uh, no.
I like that you did the YouTube ad...
I just finished breaking bad today lol
Your advertisement played before this video! That's all I've been asking for, is your voice overs for commercials!!!!!!
“Time to grab some scissors and do a little M A N S C A P I N G..”
The BlendTec reference was truly heartwarming, even more heartwarming than the heartburn I'll get from eating this.
Can you make or at least attempt the Ozymandias cake from The Watchmen series on HBO?
It's looks like los polos Hermanos from better call saul , smh
Good luck staying skinny, pete
I know I shouldn't be watching vids like this while on a diet. Maybe a vid on keto recipes for basics would suffice?
.
Gus: Come try our new curly fries, and if you don’t like them...   then I get the box cutter.
Wurst
Sluzzle
“Will it blend?” that is the question
The
Make
Please
I just remembered i had a los pollos hermanos apron i could have lent you for this episode
You said "we have to make everything" but you didn't lay an egg and raise the chicken.  0/10
2:41 ahh.. wire
The death of Fring was beautiful.
I can FEEL the high cholesterol induced heart attack all the way through the screen
“Red pepper smoke, don’t breathe this” Andrew, buddy, why you gotta tempt the stoner in me? I’ll breathe anything...
The “Will It Blend” reference at 0:55 brought back memories
"Mr. Whit where is my 20003 km/h of cocainé" - Gustavo finge
Aguante chile 🇨🇱!!
Great
well played on getting the moneyshot as the final frame
It would've been cool if he used a box cutter to cut up the chicken :D
Good enough to make you go almost two faced by the spices and explosiveness of the flavor. Little hints of Hispanic flavor too. Almost like tio used to make
I am incredibly dissapointed that you did not fry up the mushtatos
Fork don't lie.
*Please do Bill Gannon's BBQ sauce from "Dragnet."*
Time to make a foodchain front for manufacturing meth
But... didn’t they say it was slow cooked to perfection
Do the burger that Kim Wexler orders in the last episode (last 10 minutes or so) available of Better Call Saul!!
WOOW I just finished rewatching breaking bad yesterday and starting Better Call Saul, Nice timing LOL
Do the burger that Kim Wexler orders in the last episode (last 10 minutes or so) available of Better Call Saul!!
Ok
Don't let Gus catch ya cooking his recipe. He gonna come with a box cutter on ya
Whenever somebody talks about deep frying being terriFRYING (eh? EH?!) I get reminded of the time when I got back in the early morning from a seaside vacation (to celebrate finishing highschool) and I was tired out of my mind,  but also hungry as a particularly unfed shark. My folk had guests over so they just told me there was sausage in the freezer and I just had to cook it. I changed into my satin, incredibly comfortable PJs that I never wore closed up and began heating up the pan with oil in it to then, yes, drop the frozen sausage in the hot oil. Obviously it crackled and exploded, spraying me all over my bare chest and stomach but honestlly I was so tired (whole night of staying awake in the train cart because honestly fuck those beds) and I knew before hand that it would happen that it literally registered like rain drops and nothing more. So imagine a large dude, dopely staring at a sausage in a pan as oil splashes on him but doesn't seem to register. I fried some eggs to go with the sausage, ate up and went to sleep.
imperial system please
Are we sure Babish doesn't secretly own a super meth lab upon which his drug empire is based around, he's has the makings of a drug lord, the man is bald, has glasses and makes good chicken, sounds like a certain some one
Coriander, cayenne and aleppo pepper... Typical chilean spices... Yeah right 😒
that looks good I never whet to the place. I'm not even sure there is one in my area.
I can't believe in this year of 2020 id hear a Blend-tec reference. Fuck yes
Chico's tacos please
Anyone else her to ask for the unus annus burger😂😂😂
when i heard the ad with Andrew's voice, it probably made me more excited than the video did. His voice is hot. I'm not denying it anymore.  Read me the phonebook....please.
pollos
He has a huge Dutch oven, but fries in a pan.
tried deepfrying chicken. you are right, its terrifying. chicken dipped in a milk mayo bath and rolled in panko is equally delicious, and can be done in an oven with way less anxiety.
Can you do the meatturduckballitsa from The Thundermans
0:57 me outside rn
Did anyone else get Babish's ad for The Botanist Gin at the beginning of the vid?
Breaking with Badish
Finally.... It's here..... The one that I have been waiting for all this time.
Man Breaking Bad was so fucking good
Plot twist: We are watching from Gus’s security camera.
First I give the video a thumbs up then I watch
So are those bounty paper towels? Just wondering.....
Hey banish I am a big fan and can u do the Mississippi queen drink on regular show thanks
Breaking bad
Aaahhhhh WIRE.... fries.
I appreciate your honesty in saying that whlie this this was good, it was kind of a pain to make and overall not recommended over the KFC method from your Stranger Things episode. Your KFC-style recipe is my go-to for fried chicken now, but I think next time I make it I'll swap the Colonel's blend of herbs and spices for this blend to see what it's like.
Absolutely gonna do those fries.
yeeees
Making your own ads, cool.
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I got your ad for the botanist it was amazing
The ad before the video was Babish w/ Botanical and I am impressed 😎
You should make the chocolate cake from Matilda.
I’m just wondering, how many people actually watch this guy to cook food and how many will just sit and listen to him even though you can’t cook?
Was that a Will it Blend reference?
Mmmmm chimken
I was today years old when I realize Andrew had fully embraced giving us everything in wonderful grams.
Those smiles didnt look that friendly
So how did you get the recipe?
Pls do the turkey inside a monk fish from Malcolm in the Middle
Who else literally binges with Babish and never tries any of the recipes but either way just really enjoys the show and eating with their eyes.....?
Waita minute... You’re telling me if I DON’T enjoy the Curly Fries, I won’t have to pay for them?! But, if I don’t like a different item, I still have to pay for that Mc.Nasty?..
Dude I was thinking in this the other day wtf
What? No paper towel sponsor this time?
I don't like the fries, Babish. Where's my money?
I totally thought all these "will it blend" comments were about a "will it" episode of the show Good Mythical Morning I seriously had to look it up before I found the blender videos
How was the flavor though?
Holy moly that advertisement
It’s funny cause I was thinking about the will it blend guy at work last week and now hearing it in this video just proves to me that babish is the ultimate YouTube memer
when I saw you take a bite of your chicken, I then realised my new true love.
That kettle looks delightful to pour from
Kudos on the hidden valley ranch, not sure if that’s new or not but the damn ad blasted my ears.
I wait ages for this recipe!
I really wish you would have worn a los pollos hermanos apron   you can find them on Amazon for like 10 bucks
Make Gale's coffee next time, it's very fitting for the subject of recipes from dead people.
a small advice if you double fry it itll get so crisp youll hear the crunch from 50 km away
The restaurant those scenes were filmed in, Twister's, is also incredibly delicious
"Just like any right minded human being, deep frying at home scares the sht out of me” wow I literally thought I was the only one. I feel so much more comfortable knowing that Babish and other right minded people feel the same way I do.
I can't help but wonder how the tempura would taste with scotch rather than vodka
Me gustan los "Poious Jermanous" 🤭
Ok but when were we supposed to hide the meth?
I dig the “will it blend?” reference
After the episode when Babish is done with the dishes:  Jess: “This is acceptable to you?”
Were you adding or removing oil during the chicken frying montage?
Burple Nurple’s from Chowder
Breaking with Badish
Now make some crystals...
how is he not on the trending list
*H e c k*
I liked Andrews little “don’t breath this” shoutout to the old school blendtech videos
Babish: Don't breathe this, it hurts your lungs. Me on the west  coast:
viva chile mierdaaa vamoooo
Would you consider making the frog legs from The Muppet Movie?
Mr. what where is my 89mm of methé
The fries look like jelabi
I fucking love seeing you on ads for your own videos...I will never skip them
Nice
Hey Babish! As a chilean, i'm very proud of seeing your take on "merkén", a traditional mapuche spice mix. The only thing you left behind is the smoky flavor of the chilis.  Also, you could prepare the "paila marina", a traditional chilean dish who makes a part on Breaking Bad.
Can you cook meth next?
SPOILER ALERT 1:35
Could someone tell me why the Vodka ?
On this episode, Babish reveals the secret recipe to Los Pollos Hermanos...  Somewhere, off in the distance, there's the sound of a razor being unsheathed.
I’m so glad I saw this huge breaking bad fan
5:30 Babish, do you know the one thing that can make your bath tub of doom even more dangerous than it already is? Plastic gloves that melt right into your severly burned skin and fuses with it...
You know he's getting serious when he hints his next meal
"El Bell Peppers Y Carne Asada" when?
I understood that reference!
Make the blue jay burger from trailer park boys and serve roc vodka or a rum and coke with it
What the fuck is a "dry brine" ... haha I love your humor!!!!!
Could you do a "torta de jamon"  and other from "El Chavo Del 8" for you Latin friends, Pretty please =3
the final mission.      krabby patties
Next up you should make meth from Breaking Bad
That's how you make homemade tear gas
Fun fact - Real Heisenberg too died of cancer
That Pollos Hermanos "commercial" was done for Better Call Saul show
Hi Babs! When you will do the new house tour? Hope you're doing great! Hugs from Chile.
You should’ve called it Breaking babish
"Red pepper smoke, don't breathe this!" I'm sorry but was that a Will It Blend reference in 2020??
Andrew, you've failed. How can you make a breaking bad recipe and not include any New Mexico red chile? We find a way to include our Chile in EVERYTHING and you could've easily included NM red on this recipe.
Red pepper smoke, don't breathe this  Blendtech memes are back
Bruh binging with babish ad on binging with babish video
"Pepper Smoke! Don't breathe this!" That reference made me realize how old I am
Yo does anyone have any tips to make my fried chicken more crispy? I always get it a little bit soggy
You could try frying it on a wok, it got a good space for oil displacement.
Chicken was under-seasoned and the fries were over seasoned 😂😂
Can you make the pizza sundae, Reese’s recipes or Lois’s leftover casserole from Malcolm in the middle or make something from Phineas and Ferb?
Ooh! That’s good!
lmao nice bledtek reference.  your references are always off the hook
Do a collab with ordinary sausage
"sir! There is no salt in this chickein"
0/10 I didn’t get my bag of blue meth with my meal (yeah I know he’s made it before but I’m sad we didn’t get a reappearance in the plating up shot)
Now this is truly exiting
Woildve been the perfect video to get sponsored by bounty
not a fan of deep frying in cast iron, as the iron will absorb a lot of the oil.  I prefer a ceramic coated dutch oven or similar.
I feel like you're using those braziers to fry the chicken and fries so we can see it better, but for the love of god, change your camera angle and use at least a dutch oven; you're making me nervous with so little head space over a gas stove.
Funny how you have that spiralling nanotech machine  and not one fucking fryer.
Please make Birria tacos! ❤️❤️
Love breaking bad!
That blendtec reference was NOT missed don't you worry
Aw yes using only the finest ingredients and tiny whisks from our partners down in Mexico
Seemed appropriate that everything was measured in GRAMS for this one 🧂
NEXT TIME, DO THE RED WHEELBARROW BBQ FROM MR. ROBOT PLEASE 🙏🏻 ONE OF THE CHARACTERS, IRVING, EXPLAINS HOW IT IS DONE ON SOME EPISODE IN SEASON 3 🤖
Wait, a "will it blend" joke in 2020? People still remember that?
Holy shit the Will It Blend reference was a pure throwback.
Do the Mississippi Queen from regular show
this dude be doing the most
Mr whote, whee is my 20003 km/hr of methé???
Yes! Thank you I was waiting for this lol
I'm chilean and the only traditional spices were the last two lol
You HAVE to make the ultimate sandwich from Ninja Sex Party.
Babish commercial while waiting for Babish video?!?!?!?!? Finally a commercial that I didn't feel like I needed to slap the skip button.
Jess is such a lucky girl. Just saying, I'd trade places with her in a heartbeat
Bruh tell me why, I just started rewatching breaking bad and he pulls up with this😭😭😭🔥🔥
Do Ameticans not have electric deep fat fryers? All American cooking channels deep fat fry in big dangerous metal pots of boiling oil, it terrifies me!
When you get an ad for a sponsor voiced by the same dudes video you're about to watch.  Edit: holy shit a Will It Blend reference in 2020
jesse, im fucking homeless jesse
Do the quails in rose petal sauce from the movie like water for chocolate
I'm a kitchen fire survivor. Your fears are 100% founded because I'm still afraid.
GUACAMOLE HAT! PLEAAAASE!
Probably not a good idea to make the batter way before using it. The gluten that develops will probably result in a bread-y chicken? Vodka, starch, and refrigeration do combat the gluten development, however.
Why fry so dangerously in a relatively shallow pan? Why not just use a large pot/Dutch oven and fill it halfway? No fear of boil over. Is it just because cast iron is awesome?
For your next sub milestone video you should do the absolute feast of a meal that the Monster Hunter World meals are.
Tight! tight! tight!
Why didn't you use the Pollos Hermanos commercial from Breaking Bad?
Should have worn a face mask for the red pepper smoke :)
Please make more of Ghibli movie dishes
Try making the Toast from Family guy. To find the recipe on season: 15 Ep. 16 6:34
Babish should do the jelly tarts and the bread sandwich from the dragon prince.
That end picture is the best part :D great video as always
Bois who else is getting far cry 6 because gus is in it ??
WILL IT BLEND REFERENCE! Respect!
I finished watching breaking bad a week before the Ubisoft Forward Far Cry 6 reveal
TINY WHISK
What a coincidence. I was just thinking about my recent trip to Albuquerque. I got to eat at the actual restaurant where the Los Pollos Hermanos scenes were filmed. Their burritos are pretty good!
I set my apartment on fire frying food, never again.
WHEN IS THE KITCHEN TOUR FOR GOD’S SAKE?
Can you make Stillwell’s milk from the boys ?
I hope you properly cleaned the pans you used for frying.  Or else...
And what is Aleppo pepper?
what exactly does babish do with the frying oil..?
Please make the baked bads from mlp
"Make sure your potato is thoroughly attached to your spiraliasor otherwise you may be subject to antics." The dry overly verbose delivery to this line makes me smile
I'm so in love with you Andrew.... You're cooking and presenting them... And also so precise.... Amazing..... Top of the world 💓
Ah, the inappropriate crotch hair jokes.
I don't think this is what Gus meant when he said "Cooking"
YEOOOO THE RECIPE IVE BEEN WAITING FOR
Your banter is hilarious. And clever. Glad I found your channel.
What happened to tiny whisking until homogeneous???
The oil doesn't pop me cuz I pop the oil because I'm built diffrent
Binging with "do as I say not as I do" Babish.
Babish, I love you but you seasoned those chicken breast like a 40 year old white woman with acid reflux. Don't be scared of seasoning!!!
To be true to the original, you really have to scrub the kitchen after making this recipe, and not just once.
Thanks a lot for this kickass recipe Andrew. Your channel minerals !
how is it that after 15 years, 'Don't breath this!' immediately makes me wanna buy a blendtec blender.
did he say cornstarch or pornstar? i wasnt paying attention to what he was saying before
Disposable gloves working with a vat of oil make me super nervous lol. One slip or big splash and those things will be fused to your hand.
Better Call Saul > Breaking Bad
Looks very appetizing 😋
When you manscape your potatoes.
Wasn't expecting the "will it blend" reference
i click i like i watch
The chicken looks like one of those plastic chicken legs you get when you have a toy kitchen
Yummy, but I've always heard that the oil shouldn't come more than halfway up the sides of the pot. I'd be scared, too,
Lol, that ad tho! Great job dude keep working hard and having fun, and stay safe please!
Damn bruh I was just recently into breaking bad. This feels too much to feel like a coincidence
I wonder if he ever will cover the foods from the movie the Martian?
Why does Babish still not have a dedicated deepfryer? Much safer than deep frying on a gas flame in an open skillet...
If you remember any other breaking bad recipes from avatar or any other anime food wars works  as well show them at any time ok
Watching Kiki's Delivery Service, there was a pumpkin and herring pot pie. How brave are you Sir?
i really live for the potato mushrooms
where the meth tho
The will it blend refrence brought me back to 2007
Make pea soup from The Rescuers: Down Under please!
👍👍
You need to get an actual deep fryer.
Been waiting for this forever
Thank you babish.   Now get back to work
AAaAaAAh- I was about to comment on a video asking you to make this
Loving the Will It Blend? reference!
you should make food from the elder scrolls
Nice will it blend reference
Aleppo pepper isn't Chilean, it's Syrian lol
Babish, we have to cook
Pimento cheese from Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul!!!
ayyy a will it blend reference
Please Babish, don't use ruber gloves close to hot oil, it is a VERY bad idea! If the oil burns your bare hand you can wipe it quickly, but if you have the gloves, the rubber will melt and stick to your skin 😭
3:08 No Quicker Picker Upper® ?
Loved the will it blend reference
SAY MY NAME       -Andrew.   You god damn right
Yes the old ways are still best. At los pollos hermanos.
When the video started I though I somehow got 3 ads
chicken brothers
Jesse, we need to cook a delicious meal
Me parecio raro ver la frase "pollos hermanos" en la miniatura del video jaja
Fun Curly Fry Fact: The fastfood/gas station chain "Sheetz" outbid Arby's on a contract for the curly fry supplier Arby's used and now Sheetz serves curly fries that are, in fact, identical to Arby's fries.
Tiny whisk fan club <3
Please don't use plastic glovers near molten oil!
Ahhhh you mean the chilean Merken!
That “Will it Blend” reference at 0:55 made my heart smile 😌
Wow, I even went to foodsafe school and did not know about temp differences in white and dark meat. Thanks Andrew!
Will. It. Blend!
LETS GOOOOO
nice new set
a will it blend joke?!?!?! havent heard one of those in yearsssss
30 grams of vodka?? Vodka?? Can the vodka be skipped?
Haha how have you done so many Breaking Bad episodes and STILL not done the green chile cheeseburger from Blake's or NM style enchiladas? Heck even your huevos rancheros didn't have carne adovada! Gotta actually make some New Mexico food for a show set in New Mexico, Babish!
Haha how have you done so many Breaking Bad episodes and STILL not done the green chile cheeseburger from Blake's or NM style enchiladas? Heck even your huevos rancheros didn't have carne adovada! Gotta actually make some New Mexico food for a show set in New Mexico, Babish!
Fun trivia, "Los pollos hermanos" is a play on words in Spanish. a "pollo" meaning a chicken, also is a slang word for a meassurement of speed or any powdered drug, typically a couple of grams. And well i'm pretty sure everyone knows what hermano means
For the spice If you can get Merkén do it.
J
Wait what are the other spices you added your ground peppers to? Did you accidentally forget to include this in the edit? Lol
Aaaahhh seeing Gus's face still gives me chills, remembering how freakish his acting is😳😌
But did it end up in the clean plate club?
I love you a little more for leaving in the part where you huffed spice smoke.
Quick inquiry, concerned about the level of oil in ya pot don’t want you to have a boil over and burn your model hands
when he says betwixt it makes me feel fuzzy inside
Will it spice blend? That is the question!  ***loud music intensifies***
The blue
We need a potato mushroom based recipe please
*Even these really straight ones are gonna curl up in the frying oil*
On the anniversary of "Ozymandias"... Nice @bingingwithbabish
"Cajun Kick Ass
Def didn't season that chicken enough
I love BB
pros: absolutely delicious  Cons: potential death by frying oil     I’ll take the risk
0:58 Covid confirmed!
A Korean fried chicken batter with the double fry would have worked great here. It’s the only way I do chicken now
You gave our chicken to Beneke
That looks so great I’m thinking of making a video like this as soon as I start posting new videos.I will tag you in it.
Please please please be more sustainable
Jesser where's the methê
Be honest, every time you grind chili in the spice grinder, you inhale it.
now this is content
Bad potato’s get spirlized
Please do the noodles and lobster from Dinner Rush
Finally.
Looks delicious, doesnt matter who gustavo fring was
When’s the episode on how to cook meth?
That jam at the end though?!?!?
"red pepper smoke, don't breathe this" This reminds me, I learned that the Will It Blend? guy is a grandpa now. His grandkids are so cute and it's so wholesome.
After finishing rewatching breaking bad for the 5 time, I can’t believe this recipe’s episode for sooo sooo long!!! I’ve always wondered what chilean fried chicken was like!!!!!!! Thank you babish!!
We need a Sandvich from TF2
Use a wok to deep fry at home.
Next episode: Walt Jr's breakfast
Dude why do you not use a deep fat fryer??
make the jello with the stapler and mug from the office
What does he do with the oil once used? You can't have a pan full of it on the side for next month?
los pollos hermanos, a fake fast food chain used as a front for a drug-lord's business that somehow has better marketing than most real fast food chains
I always wondered why I’d get one or two straight fries with my curly fries. I just figured it had gone rogue.
That Will It Blend reference!! Love it!!
0:50 "don't breath it" even though I know what's going to happen I still do.
Wait, was that a "will it blend?" reference when you ground the red pepper flakes?
"unna" by Broke for Free sounds like the version of Something Stupid they used in Better Call Saul
I work near the actual restaurant that was redone to be Los Pollos Hermanos. It’s a local chain called twisters and i love going there for a chicken sandwich😋
It looks like you're over filling your pans for deep frying, I would be scared of frying too if I only had half an inch of air
Finally!!!!
Hi 👋
You should do the gut buster from Malcolm in the Middle. I loved Bryan Cranston on that show. It helped him get the role of Walter White.
You should do the recipes from the remmy martin ads because they don't really show you how to make it just the end product.
Will it blend? That is the question
why dont you open a restaurant with these recipes man
Next ...Walter Jr’s breakfast
I've been waiting for this for so long
I've never clicked so fast in my life.
YES, THE WILL IT BLEND JOKE, I LOVE IT
Will It blend? That is the question!
give us some golden girls recipes
I was expecting the episode to have a yellow tint
Did anyone else catch the "will it blend" reference?? 😂
You should invest in a ACTUAL frier, trust me it will be safer
When u realise that there are too many verified youtubers here 😳
Did he just make a Will It Blend reference? That just took me waaaay back in the youtube memory vault
Wtf, i was rewatching breaking bad and got yesterday before sleeping in the episode where they do a deal with gus for the first time
Love the "Will it Blend" reference!
9/10 Falto el merken
The batter for the chicken might service better elsewhere.  Maybe on a cutlet.  Something to consider.
you can just hear that potato shout 'Freedom!' as it falls into the water
Babish make the trippa snippa from big lez
This makes me want to watch breaking bad through again
Someone has been binging BrBa 🌚 its me 🤷🏻‍♀️
Uploaded on my birthday, nice.
Where do you get the metal/Tin serving trays from?
Here's an idea: Nikaido's Pork Gyoza from Dorohedoro
Make blue sky
Hell yea !!!
y
the most awaited episode
Love the @Blendtec reference 😂
TIL that there ALOT of attachments for a stand mixer
Was the meal to your satisfaction ?
Collect your "here before 1m views" ticket here ⬇️
Why  didnt you make a better version of it like you usually do?
The video I never knew I needed
Please do some vegan food many of us would highly appreciate it! 😍
That freeze frame at the end 🤢
u bald headed ninny
do big smoke's order
Really cool Andrew!! Hope to see some more chilean food in the future!!
Hell yeah
a ‘Will It Blend’ reference  you love to see it
Question is, does every side of curly fries come with a free boxcutter?
niceee
Just lost wifi so can't go to my college lecture but atleast i can watch some binging with babish
Los Pollos Hermanos, the meal I’ve been dying to see you make and on my birthday no less. Thanks for all you do
Love any kind of fried chicken and curly fries!!! Yes, ARBY's! Can't wait to see David Seymour's attempt make this one! Haha 😂
Hot Tub of Doom - new band name i called it!!
Peep that babish saucier
I need to go back an rewatch Better Call Saul season 5.Can't believe there's only one to go.Such a great series.Never doubt Vince again.
Poop_1
Was watching Breaking Bad the other day again with my wife and I was literally thinking what Babish would do with Los Pollos Hermanos
Please do the Apocalypse Breakfast from This Is The End. Danny McBride makes it look so damn good
Do Calypso Chicken but you need to say hehe boi while you do it.
That looks an awful lot like Jollibee chicken.
I would like the "Blue Sky Special" please..
wow those friesssss
Please don’t ever refer to trimming your potatoes as “*Manscaping*”
I've lived in Chile for 8 years and have only seen cayenne powder a handful of times.  Aji merken is what we'd use here.
“Don’t breath this”     *TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT*
"What does family taste like?" Elmo says  White or black, kids get in the sack.
Alright it's time to finally do this. You've done one disgusting combo before with the panini from Family Guy. NOW, my friends. It is time or you to finally try Kenan & Kel's Common Cold recipe. That would make for some AMAZING content
I’m not too fluent in Spanish but isn’t the meal called chicken men? Or chicken sons?
You should strongly consider doing the candy from Jimmy Neutron
It doesn't look like los pollos hermanos
Babish:  Gus: This is ACCEPTABLE
Is deep frying supposed to be scary??
For deepfrying I saw a video and he explain somethings about it and one of the things is for that a Wok is good for deepfrying. Just if you wanted to know :D
Next time you do a breaking bad / better call saul episode you should use new mexico chiles or chili powder. The best chiles come from new mexico.
Homemade spicy looking noodles
Wena pelao qlo, te quedó la raja el pollo
Do a series "Breaking Babish" where you cook methamphetamines
LOVE this :D
in chile we don't use cayenne pepper, we use MERKEN .
Just when I thought I couldn't love Andrew more he throws in a subtle BlendTek reference. Nice one.
I think a hush puppies worth of batter on chicken sounds kind of good.
Manscaping the curly potatoes😆
Have not watched breaking bad so thought this was a real advert😂
Try making Muriel’s happy plums from Courage The Cowardly Dog.
Make sure to hit the notification bell like Hector!!!
0:16 why is the dentist here? He should help with the golden grin casino
Babish looks like he could be a character in Breaking Bad, except he cooks food instead of crystal meth
Thank for food how
you should make brown betty from King of the hill
The real Satisfaction is when he enjoys having the piece of chicken ❤️
Can you try Cheese Puffs from The Office?? Mostly i just wanna see some cheese puffs.
Do you think you'd like to take a crack at the meals from Monster Hunter: World?
*WHY'S IT BLUE?* 🤨
Please do Jollibee Chicken Joy.
What is it you call french? I can't find a reference to it anywhere.
i’m surprised he remembers franch 😂 that was such a funny scene
Without having seen it: this is what I've been waiting for!! :-) Suuuper... I've even got the T-shirt.... as a 47 y old. Ehrm...
I have never clicked so fast fir a babyish video
Next time on the breaking bad series, roof top pizza
Holy shit a ‘Will It Blend?’ reference
Uuuuhhh recipe for human transmutation pleeeease
Yes.
*ding
I'm literally watching this for the first time, on season 4 episode 2
Did he just say arby's fries were good
You should make bills ribs from king of the hill, the process is something you would definitely be the person for
YouTube getting real comfortable with these double ads.
I’ve been waiting for this.
Drink able sausage from spongebob
i would like to hear your two cents on ethan chleboswkis home-deepfrying points. Like if you monitor your temperature it is pretty safe and oil doesn't start smelling up the house if you remove particles from the oil before they burn.
“Look at me hector” 🛎
Babish b like “ I’m the one who cooks”😏
ONLY People who didn’t come from *tiKtoK* are worthy of liking this
How do u make egg?
Should've used buttermilk and all purpose flour. Its like glue but it creates god tier crust.
make a dipping sauce using mustard and ranch it taste great start out with equal parts and adjust to taste
I can’t believe he never made curly fries before
Babish have you never had Popeyes? they batter fry their chicken (I used to work at one). They double batter though to prevent that cracking issue. It also makes it flakier (I think I spelled that right lol)
Still waiting for the episode when Andrew raises his own chicken
One idea for basics: how to take care of used oil and other things that can be used again, but who isnt used that often.
Looking hella like a Chicken Joy though...
Next episode: Babish cooks straight up meth
I feel like this is more from better call Saul then breaking bad but it’s the same so it doesn’t really matter
You should deep fry in a taller pot or wok and fill about halfway, that deep frying was giving me anxiety 😳 The food looks absolutely amazing tho!
Wow! Los Pollos Hermanos looks like a great restaurant! The owner seems so nice!  ;)
Yeah I guess you won't like Jesse's signature chili p meth after all.
Normal people: Spiralization  JoJo fans: I N F I N I T E  S P I N
Even if you die there on me!
The name sounds like something kirby would cook
Ngl Gus was my favourite.. was kinda sad on his death
"Subject to Antics" Babish once again comes up with an excellent band name unintentionally
He seems to think battering chicken is unusual.  Anyone know where he gets that idea?
Awesome, but I still use a cast iron pan for frying chicken. That’s me, and I haven’t seen a BIRRIA episode yet. Wondering when that one pot wonder is gonna play apart in his repertoire 👍🏾👍🏾
I love how you talk abt frying
I just finished watching breaking bad and it’s awesome
Meanwhile Babish is being watched by Gus through a security camera to make sure he is cooking.
Basics with Babish - Chop Suey? :>
Can you recreate Jorge Masvidal's 3 piece and a soda?
Can you do Marshall Ericsons „Perfect Burger“ from How I met you mother? He even describes the taste perfectly!
I can't lie, I'd dine at Los Pollos Hermanos, even though Gus Fring was an evil bastard and deserved to have half his face blown off. Anybody else just notice the last cashier who smiles in the commercial has an incredibly creepy grin?
Am i the only one shouting why paper towel and not a wire rack ???
HOW DID I LIKE THIS BEFORE I WATCHED THE VIDEO???
You: curly fries Me ,an intellectual: Rotatoes
Aw I miss breaking bad. Yah this chicken looks delicious in the series. In your video too :)
I'd hate to be subject to antics
"What does family taste like ?"       SWEET HOME ALABAMA !!!!!
The one that dislike this is probably breaking bed production team
Mr Whit I am taking away your steam account
What is the music?
I don't watch Breaking Bad but I've been to the restaurant where this was filmed
Bruh there was way too much oil in that pan, next time use a deeper pan or pot if you need more oil, please.
I can’t believe it. It’s happened! I watched a Babish ad before an Babish video!!!!!! My world is complete
So good it’s almost addicting!
2 tiny whisk uses in the first min?! The things dreams are made of.
Don't you need to doublefry the fries?  Like fry once, until coloured but not golden yet, then let cool and then do the batter fry step.
"Outside of Mother Arbys" Jack in the Box wants to know your location
Came here expecting a recipe for meth...
Wheres that tater tot episode. Want to see that and the green cajun sauce you said would be on it.
Binging with babish: breaking bad meth
Okay now make a pizza and toss it onto your roof
Why is this man cutting chicken on a wooden table?!
As a Chilean, I approve the spices
"Now all I gotta do is find this Hermano guy. I'm gonna kill him."
i love how you revisit breaking bad when i start watching it
Banish what happened to making yogurt from the good place
For a video you should make x-stream blue from clone high, the ingredients are pancake batter and blue house paint
Damn Babish! You brought out a Blendtec Tom Dickson quote @ 0:55?! Always entertaining and meme-tastic ;D
That juice from the chicken and crunch 😭 it looks amazing. I also need to get that spiralizer for my KitchenAid
If you are reading this, I hope you have a blessed amazing day, and whatever you are going through I hope you get through it today. God bless❤️✝️
YES BREAKING BAD BABYYYYY
Good to hear gms
Kurnel’s fried Chicken from the boondocks
Never thought my country was getting a shoutout. Pleasantly surprised ❤️
Rose Water Chicken from Chocolate for Water!
Jesse where's the concainer
Anyone else want to try a fried mushroom of potato
Eggs are nice
It looks like a normal drumstick.
Gustavo seems like such a nice guy, I can't wait to try eating at his resturant!
Im currently learning Spanish and sibling chicken scared me, and I really hoped it was a joke
me hungry
A tater tots episode???
Chicken will be raw
Chuchu Jellies from Legend of Zelda
Did you really breathe the spice smoke AGAIN?
B r e a k i n g  g o o d
Jessie, it's time to cook.
Now THATS some juicy chicken.
Thank you for the old school youtube throwback at 0:55!!!
Any med student here? Don’t those curly fries look like Ascaris Lumbricoides?😂
The amount of times you've stuck your face in the spice grinder... you should know better by now babish
I didn’t know anyone remembered will it blend.
So. Mission failed?
Should’ve done club soda instead of vodka
We have to put Babish to the test, make the Froggy Apple Crumble Thumbkin from Chowder
Chilean cuisine, very well thought!
Now THAT is a perfect clip representing breaking bad
Ominous tuco laugh in the background
Who wants to see Him make a bottle of Nuka Cola from Fallout 4
A touch of chili p
It is.... Acceptable....
Merkén
The thumbnail drumstick looks like one of those plastic drumsticks in every child's kitchen playset
Man, I have to keep my apartment sealed tight because of the smoke from the wildfires. No deep frying until it's gone :(
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR SO LONG
0:57 every Mexican mom can breath that even when they fry/dry roast them before putting them in a molcajete
What is the point of grinding red pepper flakes? Isn't that just cayenne powder?
Arbys sucks  You don’t though
Idk why y'all Americans don't use a wok for deep frying. We Indians have been using it for ages. A round bottomed wok. Deep frying becomes easier and less scary I swear. Ethan Chlebowski also has a video on how to fry. Watch that.
*This is the best food show on YT. It draws you into the world of Cusine effortlessly and it has the skills of a great cook.*
Really like the pair of babish tongs.
1:57 *30 grams of vodka* are you okay Babish?
Bruh I legit started watching breaking bad for the first time and it’s pretty cool that B&B had made this episode right on time lol.
ngl I was waiting for that bounty paper towel sponsor but it never came
Do the turkey monkfish from Malcolm in the middle!
Nobody: Babish: 🙌
That "Will It Blend" "Don't Breathe This" shout out is all I've ever wanted when you blend spices. =)
I like using a wok to fry.
here applies the joke "next episode make the crystal meth from breaking bad" but you already did that....
Breaking with Babish
Lmao the Will it Blend? Reference was killer
Alright, you got me with that "subject to antics" line, that was pretty funny.
Never ceases to amaze me! Breaking Bad is the greatest show, Giancarlo Esposito is amazing as Gus. Thanks for this video, We love you Babish!
I'm currently watching brooklyn nine nine  can you do Boyle's belt balls
Will frying in an air fryer instead of frying in oil ruin the recipe?
No way I'm gonna trust The Dentist on this one
It’s about time you give me my meth chicken babish!
i giggled like a school girl when i saw this
Ok I know the commercial says "spiciest spices" but the people in it look like they'd say "salt is spicy
ALEPPO PEPPER IS SYRIAN AND NOT COMMONLY USED IN CHILE. I know you’re trying to replicate the Merkén spice blend from Chile but make a disclaimer that you’re using substitutions bc no one uses cayenne, Aleppo, or red chili flakes. Smoked cacho de cabra aji (goat’s horn pepper) which is indigenous to the native Mapuche people is what is actually used in Chilean Merkén. Nothing wrong with subs but giving false information is negligent🤷🏻‍♀️
I CHALLENGE U TO MAKE A ZERO WASTE MEEL ( love your videos
The bon bons offered by the drill Sargent boating instructor from Sopngebob!!!!
Can we just talk about how he made a reference to those old  “will it blend” YouTube videos.  “Don’t breathe this”
Bruh who realized how ‘eyegasmic’ the camera is
I want meth now
That's the sexiest looking thigh i've seen in my life
I gusse you've never tried hardys curly fries
Mmm families now that’s fcking good food
I would've thought it was pressure fried...
*Is our food to your satisfaction?*
just wore my new headphones.    and his voiceee omfgg
Cajun kickass causes gastric distress anyway. Also I liked the callback to Will it Blend.
I wonder if any of these meals caused massive roaring diarrhea.   10 minutes or so after eating... sprinting to the restroom and them lift off! As feces are violently expelled from the anus.
Do the cactus juice from Rango
Do the dinner from the Lighthouse!
Babish: "now just like any other right minded human being, deep frying at home scares the sh*t out of me" *Julien Solomita has left the chat*
Please tell me I’m not the only one who caught his Will it Blend reference lol
Deep frying at home doesn’t scare me anymore because I’m waiting for the sweet release of death.
Right when i got into Breaking Bad? Babish you're scaring me
Pro  tip , add a small amount of meth
I’m upset you didn’t smoke crystal meth
You should make the butter pop tart from south park
especias chilenas obvio que tendría merkén
so, no fryer in the new kitchen?
When is the kitchen tour coming
inaccurate, where's the meth?
Babish, we need to cook!
Babish, what do you usually do with your used frying oil once you’re done?
It’s about time
those curly fries look soooo good
I'm deeply considering driving to Arby's right now.
Babish be making curly fries and all I can think about is how closely they resemble jalebi's ( syrup field rings ) and oh my god do I want jaebi's now and.  Andrew should make some on an episode some day to. Just a suggestion.
I saw you in a ranch dressing ad!
Damn it, now I want Twisters curly fries.
I don’t know why I cracked up so much at the potato “mushroom” 😹😹😹
I've made fried chicken with cornstarch and vodka, and the batter is just too light for me. I prefer using that kind of batter on vegetables.
Los pollos hermanos translates from Spanish to the chicken brothers. lol.
That chicken leg was juicy af.
i'm surprised that Babish hasn't made chicken from scratch.
Stable video👍
Ok you have to do the tater tots with all the dips from the Madrigal scene now
Finnicky
I was so looking forward to this video!
Very cool
Guacamole hat from despicable me
I’ve been asking for this recipe on all most every video since the dawn if babish thank you sooo sooooo much babi, as the end of 2020 comes closer and inevitable death comes with it I can spend the rest of my life in happiness
Please cook the blue thing the show is based no next 😩🥺🥺
Dude inhaled pepper smoke before yet here he is inhaling it again
This company was ran by a drug kingpin
Make the travis Scott burger please I’m asking nicely
TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT YEAH
4:17  - Deep frying at home isn't scary if you do it in a deep fryer like a normal person. No need to live on the edge, Babish!
it would be super cool if you tries to recreate the jello sandwich or the plate of artificial food from 2001: A Space Odyssey
Make the Eriksen family salad from HIMYM. With mayonnaise and gummy bears and stuff!
You had me at “Franch”.
Gustavo wants to know your location
Do deepfryers for at home not exist in the US? They are really common in the Netherlands
If Lalo liked it, it HAD to have been good
Does Babish not have a deep fryer?
Lowkey disappointed he didn't show us Walt's recipe.
Damn you Babish! I'm ordering Arby's as I type this T_T
Do americans not have cheap and reliable home deep fryers..?
I was just waiting for the video to be sponsored by bounty when he said he needed paper towels or by manscaped when he literally said it
tight tight tight tight
Mr whitè please just a crumbe of coké
So Mr.White is going into Gus' business. Well I have to say this is 99.1% perfect too.
Welcome to binging with babish (you can't make )
There was like no seasoning on that chicken
Potato mushroom..a perfect garnish for potato and steak.
Dijo chileee
Loved the Blendtec reference haha
0:05 yeah loads of tomatoes in fried chicken 🥴
You made me think about Will It Blend? for the first time in probably ten years
you should cook 228 kbps of methamphetamine from breaking bad
Love you Christopher !!  Maybe we can make this together one day, hope all is well
Babish should tackle “Happy Plums” from Courage The Cowardly Dog
If you feel like sticking with Breaking Bad theme for awhile, might I suggest the Roof Pizza for the next video?
It's sad that many people who watch this will be too young to get the 'Will It Blend?' reference. Vintage YouTube.
Chile, where Gustavo Fring is from.. What? 😂😂😂
Pollos
RESPECT the pot 'o doom.  Hot stuff!
Didn't he do a breaking bad episode?
Okay. So when is the meth gonna come?
I’ve been waiting for this one 🙌🏻🤣
Hmm, it’d be interesting to see Undertale food Mettaton’s steak, Toriel’s pie, sans’s quiche and maybe some others Or u can save it for a special video since its a lot of interesting foods he can try🙂
5:11 the struggle of using a dry hand and a wet hand xD
Is this acceptable?
I'd rather avoid deep frying. Still I want to check this out - can I make this kind of chicken in the oven?
I wonder how many new shows are coming out and in the writers room they say "What kind of obnoxious food should we put in this episode just so we can see Babish do it on his show?"
Hey! I’m chilean and the spice mix definitely looks like something inspired from here. We would use a local pepper called “merken” but the mix of red pepper flakes and Aleppo pepper looks like a great substitute!
I know it sounds questionable but can you make the casserole from Clarence
I missed... tiny wisk until homogeneous
If COVID never happened I would’ve loved to see you competing in Hell’s Kitchen ! ⛈🖤
Still waiting on the sandwiches of video games.  And the heavys sandwich from tf2
That's not a potato mushroom 🍄 (IT JIGGLES)
You finally did it! Next video: how to cook Meth.
love that blendtec blender reference
Great now I'm in the mood for fried chicken
Never clicked on a video so fast
Is it acceptable
I have a tip, Try Using Sweat PotatovStartch to fry the Potatoes and chicken. It absorbs water well and becomes a really crunchy crust without being too dense and heavy
"because now we need to make ... everything"
Disturbing thumbnail 😂
When people complain about the chicken, just invite them to your office.
Who just wants to grab that chicken from the screen, just me ok.
Hey look, if it tastes amazing than i don't care if its fragile or takes a lot of skill. I would eat his food any day
Andrew, please stop breathing spice microparticles. Seriously.
Yes! Finally!
Gus fring will be proud
Now smile and shake my hand🤝
Waited so long for this
The mention of Mother Arby's made me love Babish more than I already did. The guy seems like a cool one.
Gus fring will be proud
5:26 --- was just waiting for the oil to spill over the top of the pan
Yo wtf I watched the episode yesterday where their commercial plays and I thought babish should make an episode about their chicken
Walt jrs favorite restaurant 😋
..you ever had POLLO CAMPERO from Central America? Omg its delicious! They have it here in the states but it's not as delicious as the Central American locations😭
"Mother arbys"
OH MY GOOOOOOOD
Oh my
I'm stealing that parboiling technique that was clever.
Delicious👌
This is the first thing I am watching today and I’m already in a good mood because of it
Looks like the dentist got a better job than messing with the pay day gang.
250 GRAMS of WATER?...
mother Arbys
Did he say... *Vodka* ?
"two shots of vodka" flashbacks to that one meme
And if you look behind the kitchen, you will find a very stone face drug kingpin. With a yellow button down. And a pair of khakis.
Do cannelloni next!
Does anyone else not understand the "dont breathe this" comments
What would you say about a Phineas & Ferb special. One recipe I could think of is the Mexican Jewish festival food in the *Picture This* episode
Andrew: I'm doing chicken again. Us:awwwwww darn Andrew: BREAKING BAD CHICKEN! Us: FUCK YEAAAAAAH
“We don’t want our batter to be so thick that we can’t retrieve our bags of meth” 😂😂😂
BEEN WAITING FOR THIS SO LONG AND YOU DONT EVEN MAKE BABY BLUE that's it unsubscribed
I don't know Spanish, but shouldn't it be "Los Pollos Hermanos"?
Make One Piece recipes pls
Short and curlies very good😂
i almost spat out my drink when you hit me with the "we dont want the batter to be so thick we can't retrieve our bags of meth". i should have expected it, considering its breaking bad, but i was not.
Something tells me Andy’s a BlendTec fan.
Delicious chicken from one of the most well hidden and insidious of drug cartels.
delicious, amazing..
I thought these were always served with a friendly smile
TRAVİS SCOTT BURGER ?
Looks like we have a fried chicken technique here in Chile I didn't know of haha
Manscaping 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂
*Will it Blend Reference* 0:54
quick question, Why do you use peanut oil? its always puzzled me and im not sure why you use it
Hot tub OF DOOM. Paging @iskall85!
I always love when you say Cayenne pepper cause It’s sounds just like my name :)
Is that Babish cookware I see?
Help i cant feel my lungs
brurruuuururrrrrrruuuuuuh, please do an episode were u top Pewdiepies Sweedish hot dogs and Sweedish bread.
Christmas special that's what you should do
WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER
Time to attack this chicken leg... *SPLOOSH*
Gonna eat my family.
Still waiting for big Smoke's order
yes.
Make a travis scott Burger & fries 🍔 plzz! Like so he sees this 🍔🍟 😅
When hippie walter cooks, some pollos hermanos .  Yes he cooks , stuff that's bad for us, and very addictive Who's he?  Walter...... ANDREW RAE XDDD
I have been waiting for this episode since your first breaking bad special. Thank you!
You should make anything from food wars
At the end it just your spit on its way to land on your floor
why the vodka??
ITS ABOUT TIME IVE BEEN WAITING
YAAASSS!!
Will it Spice Grinder? That's is the question
that was a sick "Will It Blend" reference
Wait, has he never had southern fried chicken? He mentions twice that chicken isn’t normally battered when fried...  Also, using water over buttermilk for the dredge is blasphemous.
0:56 that was a good small reference.
You should do tuna, no crust. From Fast and the Furious
never thought id watch squirt porn on youtube
0:55 Was that a "Will it blend?" reference?
I cant believe it has been like a decade or so since first I saw Pollos Hermanos chicken and still crave it yet never tasted it. Thanks Babish! XD I wanted to eat this for a decade!
I got a oil burn in my hand
how in earth ur chicken can be this juicy 6:09
those are shoe strings not curly fries wtf
@Babish - The Meat Palace cuisine from Buffy The Vampire Slayer?
Love the BlendTec reference towards the beginning.
This chicken is...Acceptable.
The Gatsukatsu Curry or Garlic Bird Oyakodon from the show Toriko could be a fun project.
The amount of seasoning prepared vs. the amount of seasoning used should be a crime
“We have to make... everything” >lays an egg and starts being his bird mama until the chicken is fat enough to feed 3-4 people
The Dentist has a restaurant?  Payday 2 lover, up vote 🤡
So having lived in chile for a year I never really had that blend of spice or if that's merken i really only had it on popcorn. Usually chileans don't eat allot of spicy food from my experience
This is nice but where's the meth?
Love you babish
Hot tub of doom makes the tastiest chicken and fritters..
wrong! wheres the meth andrew??!?! wheres the meth?
What is it about the Kosher salt? Isn't non-Kosher salt good enough? Sea salt, Himalayan salt, pickling salt, flour de sea and all the other kinds of salt are jealous :(
The German scientist taste test scene is a Breaking Bad classic.
welcome back unna.
Don't use gloves when deep frying, if the hot oil hits your hands with the gloves on it's gonna be reallly bad!
You forgot the most important ingredient:   Terror...  And meth
ᴍᴇ: ᴡɪʟʟ ᴛʜɪs ʙᴇ ɴɪᴄᴇ  ᴡᴀʟᴛᴇʀ ᴡʜɪᴛᴇ ɪɴ ʜɪs ᴀɴɢᴇʀ ᴛᴏɴᴇ: ᴀsᴋ ɢᴜs  ᴍᴇ:⊙﹏⊙
How is this fried chicken technique different than a traditional fried chicken? Is a dip and dredge different than a batter fry? How? Thanks
I personally prefer this style of fried chicken over southern fried chicken. Less batter while still as crisp. Plus you don’t hurt your mouth biting into sharp batter either.
Chile lemme fry some chicken real quick
Do blue meth next
Mans got a huge cutting board
Jesse we have to cook this meal
Please.... do the following in videos. Place text of the ingredients and amount when you name them. The amount of times i have to rewind just to listen what exactly you're saying is very annoying.
I was gonna make a joke about the "what does family taste like?"part, but I think YouTube won't like it. (0:01)
"Enjoy your food." - Gustavo Fring
Maybe the sanvich from tf2
Hello
Jesser wrerees the cocainer?
Jesse we need fried chicken for Gustav Fringe very important now go
Can I do this on an air fryer I’m healthy
Cocaine from Scarface
FINALLY
Burger King and Arby's two brands that make me gag when I hear them
As delicious as this video is, WHY did you decide on this final freeze frame? I don't know what to think anymore...
Babish you forgot to serve with a smile...
A Will it Blend reference....good stuff
Hey Babish, can you please make Walt's recipe too? Thanks
Ok, this will be a wild recommendation but...Dinky Di's Dog Food from Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior (or if you are a fan of the franchise it also appears in the 2015 game Mad Max). Now i say this because it looks like proper food and appears to be one of those dog foods that are stews and makes you think "man, my dog is eating better than me tonight".
I am the one who knocks
2:20 kitchen aid comes out *Desire to see if it will sausage intensifies*
the funniest cooking tutorial
What can we substitute for the alcohol?
Chilean here. DON'T BREATHE THE RED CHILI POWDER
Methe from breaking good?
Finnaaallllyyyyy
What does family taste like?
make Travis Scott burger already
Who else got a babish botanist ad before this?
Didn't you have a deep fryer machine? It's probably in the box labeled clothes 😁
“Don’t breathe this”  Damn I just got hit with nostalgia so hard
There had better be a potato mushroom prank in our future.
Finally the video we needed
No joke I dated an friend of mine to snort the crushed red pepper flakes idk why he actually did it 🤣
"Don't breathe this"  Yeah, Tuco doesn't like chili powder either
I appreciate the will it blend meme
Please do the Broodwich from Aqua teen hunger force
oh god im hungry XD
Did he say Betwixt?
So is nobody gonna mention how he said he’s adding 30 grams of vodka at 1:57?
You know youve made it big when the comertails are youre own
Awesome recipe no doubt about it you crack the code 👍👍👍👍🙌🙋
that water ;c
Debut of another new Babish branded cooking item. The large pot that was used to fry the chicken. When will all these new items be going on sale?
wooaaah wtf i just started breaking bad S3 a few days ago epic timing 12/10
damn
1:29 “generously” my ass
JESSE, JESSE WHERE IS THE KOSHER SALT
Meth
Grams of water?
Yeah but not 99.9% pure
Breaking Bad and a BlendTec reference? Thank you for that!
I wanted ED SAUCE from good burger.😲😡😠
The fact that deep frying at home still scares Babish baffles me
Next do khlav kalash and crab juice. Also you need to get a deep fryer. Massive quality of life improvement over using a pot on the stove.
The spices he used are not even grown on chile.  We use smoked cacho de cabra chili with coriander seeds (known as merkén).  Also commonly used is: cumin, oregano, garlic, pepper and aji de color (unlike paprika, unsmoked dried bell pepper powder).
Cool, In chile we usually roast the chicken rather than frying it
Why scare your viewers about deep frying? If you have at least 2 brain cells its not dangerous to cook that way.
I love breaking bad thank you love the channel!!!
Yo we needed this fr
I needed to sleep,well that was 2 hours ago and its now 12 am
Yoooo the potato spiraliser created a Chris Evans nude
As a Chilean, no one uses those spices.
He said it! Arby’s has the best curly fries!
I don't even like fried chicken and this looks amazing!
Huh i thought Meth would be the secret ingredient
0:55 pepper spray or something idk I've never been pepper sprayed
Tater tots from Napoleon Dynamite?!?
Can you please make ichiraku's ramen with menma bamboo from naruto
About god damm time
I have never wanted fried chicken so badly in my life. I've made the Stranger Things KFC chicken several times, and now I will make this either today or tomorrow.
OHHH YEAAAHHH BEEN WAITING 🤪🤪🤪
Cajun-Kickass : So good you might as well stop your heart with the defibrillator in the bathroom, because you're not going to taste anything better.
Mother Jack-in-the-Box*
I’ve never seen fried chicken look so perfect.
When will you make Walter's meth crystals?
I bet this tastes just as good as 20003km/h of methé
"Speaking of mANscaping, heres today's sponsor the Manscape 5.0"
you should do the thanksgiving martini from how I met your mother around thanksgiving
Please Mr Babish, could you please do a viideo of scottiish food.
Babish with a Blender Channel reference 😂😂 classic
Could you cook meth in your next video?
Today on Blending with Babish, ricin powder! Don’t breathe this...seriously
Very sexy chicken! 😱👅😍
Surprised you used a cast-iron instead of deep-frying in a dutch oven.
Uh oh, Babish said home frying scares him, Ethan is gonna Ragusea you and "remaster" this video!
I really wanna try this method of chicken and + with the spice this is damn gonna be something good to try 🤭
the shot of vodka did the trick 1:55
Andrew never stops making me hungrier from HIS cooking, for some reason, shows never make me hungry.
When the potato dropped... I felt that
You should make tator tots from Napoleon dynamite Edit: nvm you are already planning it
Next person to say Jesser will get the box cutter
Yesterday I was gonna request Pollos Hermanos lol
1:37           What?
*It is acceptable*
You forget meth.
Please do a homage to Supernatural by recreating the foods from the show! Sam Winchester is giving you his puppy eyes Babish!
Thanks for leaving that chicken wing money shot in the outro for us
Hey Andrew! Can you do a basics episode on air fryers?
Are you going to make a second volume of you Cookbook
Chicken: exists. Andrew: ah, yes, the negotiator
That Will It Blend reference warmed my heart with nostalgia
I would love to see you remake senku’s ramen from Dr. Stone
am i stupid for not knowing he voices these over?
I’ve been binging a bunch of old Breaking Bad clips on my YouTube recommendations and thought this popped up because of it - turns out this was uploaded like 30 mins ago! Nice vid and weird coincidence!
Gus fring would approve of this
Are You mad for EU vievers and no C temp? :P
Thank you for calling Los Pollos de Babish, where something delicious is ALWAYS cooking...
A will it blend reference in 2020, unexpected but welcome.
Fun fact: the restaurant used in breaking bad is a local chain called Twisters! They're a very popular breakfast spot in Albuquerque, and started selling wings after breaking bad aired.
Franch lets me know that you are a true Breaking Bad Fan!!!
Not to bombard you with more suggestions but how about a Basics Fruit-Cutting special in honor of Isao Takahata?
Sojiro’s Curry from Persona 5 please
You choose the wrong ad at the start there.
Babish we have to cook
Chilean here, born and raised. I don't think I've ever seen Aleppo Pepper used down here. Hell, not even at a grocery store.
For the spooky season you have to do oogie boogie’s snake and spider stew from the nightmare before Christmas🎃🎃🎃
You’re so cute
Please make one of GTA 4 burger shot menu
Dam it babish I was gonna make the meth jokes
Gimme a "Face Off" Burger, please 🍔  🍔  🍔
His nails are perfectly cut oml
i got an ad of babish advertising alchohol. i thought it was apart of the video for a second.
Y E S
And now I'm hungry again thanks dude
Those looks like Jollibee's chicken, damn good
Did I watch and thoroughly enjoy this entire video? *Yep* Am I going to actually cook any of this? *Nope*
Who else is mad he didn't serve them with a smile at the end.
Damn It Babish I felt that chilli "smoke"
Should have gotten bounty to sponsor this one
Who else got the ad he narrated? I love your voice so much. Become a narrator. Please. I could listen to a whole audio book of your voice 💞
I’m assuming he’s going to use cornstarch, hopefully I’m right
"usually chicken is not batter fried" wait what?
Amazing
0:16   Gus: if you don’t like your fries they’re on me  Me: Mr fring my fries were soggy   Gus: *slowly opens box cutter*
Any time I fry something HOT TUB OF DOOM
We've all been waiting for this
Now you need to make the mackerel limburger taco from rocket power....👍
Please do the Monty Python SPAM. sketch.
5:57 "A most unusual method for preparing fried chicken..."   Growing up in Cleveland, I thought the ONLY way to eat fried chicken was batter fried.  Every semi-famous local wing joint up here batter fries their chicken.
A "Will It Blend" reference?  In 2020?  (Checks calendar to verify date)  I'm not complaining, just surprised.
But... But you forgot the chili powder!
I’ve batter fried chicken before and I found that a second coat of flower over the batter helps with the problems you had
Always assumed it was buttermilk
"Pepper smoke. Don't breathe this!" That is OLD YouTube meme technology right there!
As always, your food is amazing. I was a little nervous about the depth of the frying pan you used with the chicken. Thanks for the video!
momther arbie.......
it looked like you fried spaghetti
When will he make the breakfast from studio ghibli's kiki's delivery service?
I ❤️ Gus
I'm still waiting for the day where Americans find out that we have a thing called "frituurpan" in the Netherlands, which makes deep frying not "scary as shit"
"Mother Arby's" I love it.
I am ever so slightly disappointed he didn’t cook up and consume that majestic potato mushroom
Jesse how do you make curly fries
I love the fried chicken. On the other hand, I don't care about the fries. Is it just me??
Quang Tran is an obese washout!
Yoooo! Did you just quote Tom Dickson from "Will it blend?" I havent heard that quote in literal years!!!
Sometimes killing Gus feels like a mistake.

That chicken honestly looks perfect
This man has easily created the most professional looking cooking show on the platform
Please make the wing tip gyoza from food wars.
broo the youtube algorithm is ridiculous, past few days ive been recommended and watching breaking bad clips.... then couple days later babish drops a breaking bad episode. wtf
Unflavored popcorn salt is way better for uses like the dry brine since it is about the same particle size as the spices
0:55 classic YouTube reference

Finally
I just had to pause the video at about 3:20 to record my distaste. I did not get any good feelings from the comparison of curly fries to pubic hair.  And now on with the video.
Curly Fries next
Ive never been this early but you should make the Brudewitch from Aqua Teen Hunger Force. I know its a lil out there but it’s content 🤭
Please do one from food wars
This guy literally made my quarantine
I was binge watching some of “Binging with Babish” episodes and every time I got a Hidden Valley Ranch commercial that had Babish in it.
That franch reference in the beginning. Nice one
The 'will it blend' reference got me.
a

Did not notice until halfway through but Andrew is exclusively using metric system. Big appreciation from an Asian.
I love how nice the new kitchen looks! :D
Frying at home scares the crap out of me, too! Looks tasty though.
The only think I can say is VIVA CHILE
This is such a lame one. It's just fried chicken. Eds secret sauce would've atleast been interesting. I have no idea why people voted for this.
WHERE IS THE COCAINER JESSÉ
yes please
Finally los pollos hermanos 😎🤘
Wow
Dat first chicken bite - oh man
Got The Botanists ad on the video, very meta
You should make the fish from better call Saul that chuck makes

This recipe goes great with a side of Blue Meth
That homie is dead       They just haven't alerted him
Can you try the Oreo Brr from the new Netflix movie “i’m thinking of ending things”?
Pollos Hermanos always made me think of Super Campero...
So are you ever gonna cook meth from Breaking Bad?
I’d be scared too if I was deep-frying in a shallow cast iron pan! I know you have a Dutch oven!
Deep frying at home is dangerous?  Me: Breathes in southernly
???: What matters...is the quality of the product. Babish: *breaks chicken batter shell in the fryer* ???: *draws boxcutter*
Potato bhajji lol
You know you've made it when you're getting 210k views within an hour of release with a cooking channel.
Batter comes complementary with a bag of crystal meth.
“Franch” sounds like a fart made while stretching. “Ranchard” sounds better, IMO
Day 22 of requesting remy’s lightningy mushroom from ratatouille
I dont even know how to cook but i love watching these lol
*Smells red pepper*  TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT  Los Polos, Huevos Rancheros, blue meth, whatever man, just keep binging me that
vodka wouldnt make sense you can clearly see kids in the commercial and in breaking bad and in better call saul eating the chicken
"what does family taste like?" probably just like normal human
i hope he meant napoleon dynamite when he said 'tater tots episode"
Could you make some food from One Piece?😊 One of the characters is a chef and he makes lots of good food🤩🥰
Even Babish knows Arby’s Curly Fries are the top tier of curly fries
"Red pepper smoke. Don't breathe this..........Seriously, it hurts your lungs."  Corona virus: "Are you challenging me?"
Be safe with the frying on a gas stove, I trust your expertise but you never know❤️   You can get a small electric induction top just to deep fry on safely if you have any room to store it
Babishs voice is perfect for this and I love it keep doing great things brotha
Babby got that WAP (Wet Ass Pollo)
Dos Bros tacos from turbo
Woooow! Get out of my head, dude! Ahah! I decided to show my paretns the Breaking Bad series, and this video popped up in my feed. You're a real magician, Babish! A real one!  P.S. Can't wait to see "the blue" recipe 😉
The th cleanest fried chicken I ever watch
0:55 God i feel old with that reference
That money shot at the end, lol.
oh. my. god.  That thumbnail should be illegal.  That...oh god.  I want it so bad.
I was going to tell a fun little poultry pun..  *But I don't want to wake up in the desert with a bag over my head!*
The money shot
That bass guitar tho..
If you want the real chilean spice experience, try some merken (smoked chiles), its soooo good!
just watched that episode like 2 hours ago lol
That add, looked like from a South Park episode!
"frying at home scares me" * ethan chlebowski wants your location *
Let’s gooooooooo more breaking bad
Show us how to cook the blue meth, Babish. Ffs
Nobody is gonna say it so I'll take the bullet:   *WE WANT METHAMPHETAMINE RECIPE*   _And screw you NSA for spying on me_
I'm a simple man. I see Breaking Bad, I click.
Also known as validation to own a fryer, to not be scared of hurting yourself D:
Wait wait wait, was that a mother flippin' "Will It Blend" reference?
Fried Chicken is made of 3 simple parts.
This Guy just Beats All The Chef’s At Tasty
Yes, I've been waiting for this one since Andrew made the blue crystal meth.
This is the moment Walter Jr. became Flyn
Babish: Let's cook
Make bitch lasagna
I need that ad on all my vids
You should make Walter’s recipe next ;)

Jesse its time to cook Bacon
Binging bad
3:10 You should have asked Bounty for another sponsorship
I just finished Breaking Bad two days ago lol.
Bwb: hot oil is dangerous  Me having ptsd about 4th of July drunk putting a frozen burger in a puddle of grease on a griddle: !!!!!!
Woah gusto finve
Some one better make a “cosier salt” compilation one day
you should do clam rolls and/or the medicine juice from the path!
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEES.
Hmm do you have two books out now? I was putting together a little wish list for myself and saw a Binging With Babish cookbook (with forward by Jon Favreau) on the Binging website and Eat What You Watch on the Basics website/page.
Is there an alcohol substitute for the batter
Vat of Doom. This is a nice way to make fried chicken and I might have to try it :)
Came for the recipe I've been waiting for since I found this channel, found bonus "mother arby's" phrase
Why is this KFC commercial recommended to me at 11pm?
Andrew. I noticed that you don't rlly use non stick pans. Why?
What's a gram?
So you’re telling me that all this time I believed they gave me a surprise “extra” regular fry in my curly fries it was only the middle part!? Disappointed realization.
How many times is Babish going to mace himself?  Answer: whenever he grinds pepper flakes.
Now U are grasping at straws..
Can I recommend green hot dogs "yaprak dolması" from Arthur?
Every video sinc the meat torando i will be amazed by the new kitchen again and again
I agree that deep frying on the stove is terrifying. Is why I try not to do it whenever I can get away with it. Deep fryers all the way, or just bake instead.
Never expected to see your ad with hidden valley ranch on your video lol.
"What does family taste like?"  According to reputable sources, pork.
i got a hidden valley ranch ad where Babish stars before the video and i thought it was him being ironic
0:56 blend tech! Don't breath this
Sorry to ask this but would ice water be better for the starch reduction for the Curley fries ?  I'm not a chief. This isn't a critique but a actually question
Who else gets a heart attack at the oil level of the chicken frying pan?? Lol
Hey, Chilean, here. Sadly our traditional spice game is weak. We don't use Cayenne or Aleppo pepper in our cuisine, although we do have a wide variety of different spicy peppers and at most we use Merkén (grounded Cpasium annuum). I must say your Paila marina was on point.
you've done fried chicken too much
"the spices used here are very commonly used in Chilean cuisine..." me, a Chilean, who has never tasted an Aleppo pepper: "um"
Will it blend? That is the question
This is not the video we wanted, it’s the video we needed.
"Will It Babish?"
Kosher salt da goat
We need a BWB and Matt Stonie collab
Theory: Babish is actually Walter White. The story was a lie, all but the illegal actions he persued previously.
Did anyone else get and add with Babish and Hiden Vally ranch before the video
I just woke up to this and i have to watch it
Yes! This is what I needed!
Babish: we have to make everything *proceed to plant potatoes, raising chicken*
Loved the “Will it Blend?” reference
Me acordé de los pollos del tarragona snsjsjs 10/10
Yes!!!!! Finally, the best fast food in all universe!!!!
This gon blow up big time
Hey, how about the Stew from The Hateful Eight!
Why no buttermilk?
Please do an episode on chowder (the show)
Somewhere Chef John is crying tears of joy over the amount of cayenne in this video
What can i substitute vodka with?

Instructions unclear, ended up moving to Albuquerque and becoming a drug dealer with cancer
Gus Fring is the GOAT
Finally!
I got babish ranch ad
mr whited where is the cocainer
Ah yes...tiny whisk
the ammount of fries in the table makes me hungry
"JESSE AY JESSE YU BRUV THE WRONG RV" "I'm SoRrY mR. Whote, I tOoK tHe MeThY" *insert surprised disappointed face walter white made
I had the new ranch commercial and thought he was making ranch wings or something. Weird
I'd fry more if I didnt feel like it was a waste of oil, messy too.
Getting an ad with Babish right before a Binging with Babish video...
Pro Tip: Use Meth as seasoning, brings out the flavours
Baking bad
the Heisenberg of chicken 🍗
As much as I want to like this recipe, I'm having a little cognitive dissonance about it. It just feels, I dunno, unlikely to me that any fast food restaurant governed by the F.D.A would have Vodka in it's ingredients list, but to be fair this isn't really based in any sort of actual knowledge about F.D.A standards for fast food restaurants so I'd love to be proven wrong about it. I guess I just think that this recipe should be for the more gussied up version, and using one of the lesser concoctions for the main.
One major way to reduce the danger of deep frying at home is to not use latex gloves for dropping your food into the oil. If that oil is hot enough to melt your glove, the now liquid rubber will melt into your skin, creating just gorgeous 3rd degree burns.
The chicken comes in frame Babish: Ah yes, the negotiator
Instead of making chicken you should've made meth
NGL, the last shot in the video looks like he is salivating so much that his saliva squirted out when he took a bite.
Now to add the cocaine
started craving fries at the end, actually did that then. thanks babish
That looks so freaking delicious.
You should make Kevin’s chili from the office. Pls?
yes, metric system!
I had a Babish ad before this
1:56 "30 grams of vodka"  *glug glug glug glug*
Bab's skip the cast iron go deep fry in a wok. The high sides make it way less scary and you have a ramp to slide in delicate things.
I got a binging with babish ad before this vid
Please make meth.
Banish use a bigger pot/pan to fry and it won’t be so scary 🤦‍♂️
So we can’t retrieve our bags of meth 😂 oh breaking bad
Oh that's tight! Tight, tight, tight, THIGHT!!!
Gus fring delivers anything with a smile, but not on his face
Jesus christ, Marie.
Question: Do americans don not have a homestyle deepfryer? I always hear from the american yt cooks that deep frying is so dangerous.
Finally I can die with sastisfaction now
FYI this is basically Popeyes fried chicken method just they batter then flour the chicken lol so ya know good work babish :3
Subject to spiralization.....🤣
Glad to see I'm not the only one who goes cheap on spice grinders. Also, deep frying at home scared the hell out of me too. Some of those injuries you just don't forget.
I can't wait to make this so I can do a potato mushroom based prank thanks for the Idea Andrew
Hey Babish, just wondering. Do you have a electric frying pan in America? We have a frying pan here in the Netherlands, which is electric, can be set to a temperature and has a safety system for overheating or for beeing on too long. You know, just like the kind in a fast food place but smaller for home use. I always see cooking vids in a pan with oil in it, which looks dangerous to me.
0:55 oh shit is that a  motherfucking "will it blend" refference!
Got your hidden valley add on your vid. Lol
Don't eat the blue chicken !
Next on binging with babish: how to cook meth
Mother Arby’s
This be sesame street if they started a junk food place..
99 cheese pizza from tmnt please
3:12 what a missed opportunity to be sponsored by manscape the body trimmer company, that would have been the cleanest Segway into a sponsor ever haha
Finally, my life is complete
Jesser we need to make 20003/km h methê
You'd think he'd learn to not sniff aerated spices from the chilli episode where he almost died.
Wait... was that a “will it blend “in 2020?
A better curly fry than I ever thought could ever be available outside mother Arby's   Joshua Weissman entered the chat
"mother Arby's" hahahah
I made some ground pepper using home grown dragon cayenne peppers. I learned that apparently that’s how tear gas is made 😂
The moment he used cayenne pepper is the moment Babish became Chef John
Oh I fucking love this waiting for so long haha. I literally made my own cafe after his restaurant lol
1:37 the moment he said Chilean and i saw a red powder i knew it was something like Merkén
Andrew where are the black gloves? I demand answers.
The owner of the chicken joint is a great guy , i hope he’s not blown up or anything
You forgot to add meth
KOSHER SALT
I think The Burger from How I Met Your Mother should be next
I wanna see this man make water
Hey babish I know this question is dumb but does peanut oil smell like peanuts
Amazing video keep it up!
Nice, will it blend reference
man, quarantine really messed up Babish he didn't even make his own chicken out of nothing to make the drums. unsubbing rn... so disappointed...
Finally
Do the Turducken sandwich from Supernatural!!!
“Don’t breathe this.”   Shoutout to Blendtec. Old school YouTube ftw.
Look how he does everything clean   So *clean*
I've been asking for this one for years!
Babish if you do the pizza to throw on your roof, remember DONT CUT IT! they pass the savings on to you!
Please do the soup from ratatouille
Perhaps Lalo was correct.
Literally got your ad on your video dude
This is horribly cruel as someone who's too afraid to deep fry so I barely use any oil, and have had some serious fried chicken cravings for months in quarantine XD
Just started breaking bad rerun today. how'd you know Babish? 👀
I'm surprised that you didn't gain alot of weight after eating every thing you made 👌👌👌
Who else watches Binging with Babish but never attempts cooking?  Like if you do..
Wait so what was the point of the tiny sauce in the beginning...? Odd intro, but loved the vid!
my favorite thing about babish is that he always leaves in his mistakes so we can laugh and learn from them. what a guy
Andrew you might not see this but how eats the rest of that food if it doesn’t enter the clean plate club?
DUDE I THOUGHT IT WAS PRONOUNCED "BA-BEESH"
Sorry but what was the second pepper I didn't understand it and there are no subtitles???
I cant't believe this episode isn't sponsored by Bounty Paper Towles.
bro is there anything that you can't do?!     I want you to do it please because everything seems easy to you LOL
And just like that I'm hungry again....
It's not Chilé, it's Chīle, greetings from Chile BwB🇨🇱👏👏

Do food from Final Fantasy 15!! Do a collab with Ignis
The folios ermnos tho
I was looking forward to this! Amazing video, you never disappoint 👌
Thank you
Is anyone gonna tell Babish that Youtube stopped doing the links in the corner like a year ago
I was about to say what do potatoes have to do with a chicken wing lol
Please make soylent green.
Yum
viva chile
Did you say    T H I C C?
When you get babish’s ranch ad on a babish video
My secret ingredient is Chili Powder, yo!
Anybody else get Babish’s Botnist ad?
Travis Scott Burger
Literally finished breaking bad today and than this😐
Could you please try to make Sojiro’s Curry and Coffee from Persona 5?
Hey Babish, this recipe sounds great, but if you were trying to recreate Merkén (The chilean spice mix I think you were going for) you needed a specific smoked hot pepper instead of the ones you used, and you went a bit heavy on the coriander
Gustavo wants to know your location
Do you think you could do this with a air fryer?
"I'm the cook. I'm the man who killed Gus Fring. Now say my name."
That is one of the sexiest chicken ive ever seen
You ought to make some Korean fried chicken
Yo babby
You should definitely invest in a fryer.
SAY MY NAME
I got a binging with babish ranch ad :D
Make sushi
Yeah! SCIENCE!
Why is that chicken so... chicken shaped?
I was just talking with my bro about how los pollos hermanos chikens would taste like 😂
I loved the Will it Blend reference.
Batter fried chicken unusual..? I mean yeah I guess for some people but I've batter fried some tenders before to make a 'pub' style batter..tbh the  ones I've cooked at home in batter look like the chicken tenders I used to get at Long John Silvers..before the only one in my town burned down..after I started eating there again..and only ate there 3-4 times..the next closest LJS is 20 miles and around 30-40 minutes away from where I live..so I have to make due at home.
Jeser, im hungy. we need to cook chickeyy
Somos el mejor país de Chile hermano
I'd like to see you make ice cream rolls one day
Do Mike’s Pimento Cheese Sandwich
Make those pizza gyozas from TMNT
“Don’t breathe this.”   WOW! That is one deep cut, OG YouTube reference!
Babish: now we're gonna start by raising our own chicken. start with a set of fertilized eggs Everyone: wait!!!!
Measuring in grams? Why man? I'm American and have willfully ignored the metric system.
But did you serve it with a smile?
🇨🇱🇨🇱
Unironically, I've never clicked on a video this fast
What’s the secret ingredient? 🤫😅😳
Isn't this clip from Better Call Saul ? Breaking Bad probably gets more traction though. Thats some good looking chicken
I miss Arbys.
I always watch your videos a little bit after it is uploaded and decide it’s too late to comment... But this time I’m different! I ate a pineapple 🍍
Even after all these years, he still quotes "Will it Blend?"
“Mother Arby’s” slayed me lol
Sadly, there is no link in the upper right corner for the chicken disassambly. (1:24) I think I have seen it thrice now, but I am sure every episode convinces more of us to join you ;)
Home frying tip:  Do your flrying in a wok.  It's deep in the middle to sink things, It's wide at the top, to catch splatter. The shape means that you need less oil overall (as it's shallow at the edges).
I heard the word BATTER too much
Every time I watch a BWB video i get a BWB ad
Watching that pot filled to the brim with bubbling oil on a gas stove gave me some serious anxiety.
Is everything to your satisfaction? :)
Real ones know what the spice grinder is really for
Not gonna lie, I so totally want to use mushroom-looking potatoes for some sort of festive dish.
Could you please do some of the food from Food Wars!
Right when i start season 3 of better calls saul, this gets uploaded babish you are a genius
Where's the Quicker Picker Upper when you need him most?

Next you gotta do all the dipping sauce tests from the German headquarters lol
I love Gustavo , that dumb Walter White that caused his death , I really don't like Walter he's so ...... I could write a whole bestsellers on y I don't like him
2:05 "We also don't want the batter to thick that we cant retrieve our bags of meth"  Me, who hasn't watch breaking bad: I'm sorry w h a t .
1:12 once ”AGANE”?
Dont breathe and he does. Always follow the voice not the expirement home cooker
Missed a chance to say, "Cooking with Heisenberg."
his voice is q soothing to hear lol
This is the most perfect looking fried chicken I’ve ever seen. Keep up the good work
Never clicked faster
Will it spice, that is the question?!?
6:42 you know these chickens are damn good as hell when his mouth just came on the first bite
Damn... Thats a good commercial.... I wanna eat there
That chicken look hotter than me😭
It's TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT
“Don’t breathe this” lol I remember the glory days of YouTube where Blendtec videos were big
Ah, Americans, measuring water in grams. 1ml=1g
You should do the food from Joe Pera talks to you; Perfect Egg Bite, Pemmican, Warm apple, etc
TIGHT !! TIGHT !! TIGHT!!
I do not own a tiny whisk, will a regular whisk do the same job, or do I need to go out and buy a tiny whisk? :)
Your short overfilled pots make deep-frying scarier than it needs to be.
is that guy the dentist from payday 2?
0:57  Andrew: Don’t breathe this Me: Is that a Will It Blend reference
THANK YOU for stating the temperature difference with the chicken parts. It's why turkey always ends up dry, because people cook the breast to 185 when it should be 165. Ahhhhh. I needed that sliver of vindication in my life.
dat "will it blend?" reference...
Dry brine.. what a term lmao
JESSE WE NEED TO FRY CHICKEN JESSE
0:21 Does anyone else like the way he says 'to' while saying welcome back to binging with babish?
"don't breathe this"  *babish dying*
I really just want my ring tone to be babish saying OOOO thats good
i am chef too but the way you cook it's amazing to watch Grace and art of your cooking🥘
1hragoaye
Am I the only one that’s seeing Breaking bad things everywhere these past couple days??
I am the one who salivates.
hello cooking torso
Why do you use such a shallow vessel to fry in?
IVE BEEN WAITING
That "don't breathe this" call back to that blend tech made my brain spark with nostalgia.
the way he pronounces water 😭😭😭😭😭
The clip at the start and curly fries are actually from Better Call Saul
Babish: "...and batter-fried, a most unusual method for preparing fried chicken.."  Koreans: Haha, where have you been the last ten years?" ;)  In all seriousness though, it looks delicious!
Deep frying tip: never, NEVER fill your cooking vessel more than half with oil.
MODERN FAMILY FOOD!!!!
Definitely making this for dinner tonight
Those are the most sexiest chickens I've ever seen
Do the chocolate eggplant burger with hot sauce from the 2002 live action Scooby Doo movie for me please
2:47  Pause
To get the best looking chicken dip into batter and then flour
"Don't breathe this" getting some serious Blendtec vibes
Now make the blue stuff
Why is everybody make a big deal about deep frying ?
In English: The Chicken Brothers  In Spanish: Los Polos Hermanos   Spanish can make even the silliest name sound sexy...
OMFG THAT WILL IT BLEND REFERENCE LOL MY CHILDHOOD
Isn't  this better call saul
if he could make the chicken himself, he would
Hey Babi, please make Branzino from The Amazing Spider-Man.
That potato mushroom is the best thing I've ever seen in my entire life!
Who else got a ranch ad with babish in it
Caveman Meat or the Cheese Winged Gyoza from Shokugeki No Soma would be amazing to see.
0:55 Will it Babish? That is the question.
This man said “mother arby’s” in a youtube video. Disgusting. 10/10
The will it blend reference took me back.
4:22 Is it just me or does that look like he's frying spaghetti I-
I just need my chicken fried at least 5 more minutes 😩
pollo cocodrillo
I am going to go against Babish here and recommend absolutely NO ONE deep fry anything in a skillet or frying pan on an open flame stove top, no matter how big.  You're just asking for a disaster with that.  If you have to deep fry at home (and Babish is right, it should scare the shit out of you, as many people end up in hospitals because of it) use a dedicated deep fryer unit, or a large pot with at least two inches of clearance between the oil and the lip.  I understand Babish maybe  thought he had to use that frying pan for the camera angle, but that was simply irresponsible and sets a bad example.
I gotta be honest this looks like jollibee to me.
I want to hear Andrew narrate an audiobook of an erotic smut novel
Breathing in powerized chili flakes is a painfully fun past time memory of mine.  I had a chef who was insistent on this, but found out why he never did it himself.
I clicked so fast like so fast
Play too much Payday 2, saw that commercial at the beginning and went like 'The Dentist?'. Forgot the character was based on his Breaking Bad character :P
This is your brain: 1:14  This is your brain on drugs: 1:22
I got no notification from this.   Looking at you Youtube.
Can we get a meth recipe?
Those are some nice shortened curlies you have there, Babby.
YESSS  HE FINALLY DID IT
If you don't like fried chicken... Explain yourself
Juicy!
I know you own a deep fryer. Since you needed a large quantity of oil and were concerned about splattering hot oil, why didn't you use it?
Having never seen Breaking Bad (but having seen The Mandolorian) I just have to wonder why Moff Gideon is trying to sell me fried chicken.
Can you make the butterscotch Cinnamon pie from undertale?  Also I like turtles
Babish is “The One Who Cooks.”
This is not how you make drugs...
Hello
my homeboy having those will it blend references and i love him more for it.
mama mia I’m hungry
*2020* : You are now subject to *antics*
Did he get a new pan or what? This doesn't look like the all clad listed on his equipment list. I only ask, b/c that pan looks amazing and I wanna get one, minus the engraving ;)
That chicken is moist
WHERE IS THE NEW KITCHEN /HOUSE TOUR ANDREWWW!!!
Missed a syllable there in "ethereal" haha
thanks for the video I stop working on my school work to watch this
I was literally thinking about pillows hermanos 💀💀💀💀 that YouTube algorithm which reads your thoughts ffs
When u get the babish hidden valley ranch recipe ad on a binging with babish video
Interesting fact: Pollos Hermanos actually exists
Disappointed there wasn't any meth in the ingredients.
Didn't I vote for this like 2 months ago?
Why is everyone watching Breaking Bad again? My friend started watching it the other day.
Breaking Bad was so well written. Every character could have their own "spin off" and they'd be amazing.
A babish ad on a babish video
forgot all about will it blend... shame
❤️👌
:”Deep frying it in hot oil scares the s*** out of me”  asian moms: *pathetic*
I have waited for this episode for SO long
I got your hidden valley ad
you said tater tots.....
Why are you using grams when measuring water ? It sounds weird, why not use ml instead ?
Who was watching kiaras stream before this
Oh damn oh damn oh damn
"Hot tub of doom"  Iskall85 wants to know your location
Can you do a Reptar Bar from Rugrats?? It's gonna be a challenge but you'd forever gain some random guys respect.
Why don't you raise your own chicken while you're at it.
I just finished breaking bad for the first time last week, so happy theres so much breaking bad content coming out recently out of knowhere
Video idea: Simpsons Season 9 Ep. 17 at 5 minutes 30 seconds. Please and thank you.
I got the notification and it says it was uploaded 53 minutes ago
I got the notification and it says it was uploaded 53 minutes ago
Me me early boy
Nice :)
I just re-watched the last episode and you just popped
So we have binging with babish basics with babish so where's singing with babish
Dear Sir, Can't wait 4 the recipe 2 be added
Whoa whoa whoa. I haven't started the vid yet, but you actually shot a dope ass REAL commercial from your last video? I got you as an ad before your own video and it was epic. Congrats on that crazy achievement.  Edit: Holy shitballs you bookended your own video with a SECOND ACTUAL COMMERCIAL?! Go you.
scrumptious
Viva Chile!
The potato snipping was really weird to watch :D
Yo i was thinking you making meth
Hot tub of doom sounds like a terrible highschool garage band
who else is on a zoom class and is really bored rn
3:16 we will do a bit of manscaping, is Babish telling us who his next sponsor is?!
Those spices are not common on chilean cuisine
Do roof pizza...     ...and dipping sticks.
Really want to do this recipe but the amount of oil wasted is a deal breaker for me..
Now you have to do Roof Pizza.
Did anyone get an ad for a ranch sauce featuring Babish before watching a Babish video?
Just visited the Walter white home in ABQ in the last two weeks. Perfect timing.
can you make the Mississippi queen from regular show
WAIT YOU DID IT!! I LITERALLY JUST ASKED FOR THIS YESTERDAY!! OMGGG I'm rn watching better call saul
So beautiful.
What do you do with the failed attempts of the stuff u make?
When the chicken looks perfect...
This looks so tasty, but why isn't it in 4k Andrew?
Make the Jumja Sticks from Star Trek Deep Space Nine "In the hands of the prophets"
those who. are reading this may god bless their parents ❤️😆
Dinner Sandwich from Uncle Grandpa
Did anyone else get an ad for the botanist gin done by Babbish before this vid? I was confusion lol
I swear every time you do a cooking video using that background song it’s like a trance and soothing ... darn you Mr.Babish with your cooking ways
got the binging with babish ranch commercial before this video   Legendary
Mmmm iPhone smoke. Don't breathe this!
I got a babish commercial before this
Great Will It Blend reference
I'M GOING THROUGH THE SERIES FOR THE FIRST TIME RIGHT NOW AND I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO MAKE A POLLOS HERMANOS CHICKEN RECIPE AAAAAAA
Because of the ad for a minute there I thought it was a real place😅 Like Breaking Bad used an actual franchise in their series.
shoulda gone for beer with the batter for the fries imo, looks great though
Babish: this are ussuall in chilean cucine. Me: hold on a minute, ¿someone actually said the name of my country?
Make meth 😂
Definitely making those fries this week, fuck they look good. 🤤
God damn it babish, a dry brine is not a real thing. Brines by definition are wet. Its a dry rub or dry cure. This is the hill I will die on.
Just finish season 4 today
Ah yes, chicken boys my favorite
Those seasoned curlies look incredible!
I spent a few years in Chile and never saw those spices used. I didn't eat out much though
Babish is easily the most entertaining and wholesome online chef.  Your subs are well deserved sir
Damn that gin Ad was baller
Hi 👋
finally
You say breaking bad but that was better call Saul, kinda disappointed
I'm not a big fan of chicken, but this recipe could change my mind!! No matter what - I'm IN for the curly fries!!
I just got a babbish x hidden valley ad! You're like, hella famous now!
0:55 - A 'Will it Blend?' reference in 2020. Babish truly is a man of culture.
Babish: "Spiralizes your tater"   Me: Wait I thought this was a cooking video?
I click this video with an ad of babish talking about ranch
What does family taste like?   Hannibal : good. With a little Chianti.
do the heroin from trainspotting
Explain yourself!     Oh good! You have
Holy smokes! My voting paid off!
What does family taste like?  I am not sure... but I do believe cannibalism is still frowned upon.
Loved the "will it blend" quote
You should try Fry Sauce with those fries. I’m from Utah, and we love our Fry Sauce. Easy to make but other use special ingredients to make it their own.
how does he know I just rewatched the entirety of breaking bad the last few days?
Did anybody see how they want to scrap Far Cry 6 because of the main bad guy?  Because he’s black and playing a Cuban guy.  People suck.
"chicken brothers"?
seriously wanna try pollos hermanos curly fries!!!
We all know the recipe isn't accurate without adding meth to the batter
Love your videos man.... but please use a de-esser on your voice or something. Every time I watch your videos I start to go a little crazy because all the S sounds in your voice are so loud. It would sound way better with maybe even just some EQ on that frequency Hope you read this and don’t hate me 😬
At long last.... One taste and you will know
Haha I love how he always says not to breath in the spice dust but does it everytime anyway
"Defrying at home scares the sh!t out of me." Same...
Yes, It blends
I would love to see a couple of basics with some gluten-free options.  Like pasta and bread.
You should try to make the Travis Scott burger from Macdonalds
Nut
Am I the only one who thinks that Americans need to realise that domestic deep fat fryers are thing, ad. Quit this bollocks of filling up s pot and doing it on the stove top.
I am trying to slim down, then i see this... Guess i am gonna be fat a little bit longer
Can’t believe I got an ad with Babish before the video.
Suprised he didn’t teach us how to raise our own chicken for insured crispiness.
1:12 D-did he just say "ageyn"?
Not gonna lie.  Halfway through cooking I completely forgot about my meth :(
It would be cool to see a rabbit-ven-it-ture-duck-in-ig from rhett and links break up song
"Subject to antics"  Goddamnit Babish, you're the best.
Babish do you think you could make the club sandwich from Half Life alyx?
You should do the Travis Scott burger next
why do you keep posting good content? I'm trying to do online school
I got confused where you got 10 pieces from one chicken. You must've cut the breast into 4?
Nobody:  Literally Nobody:   Andrew:  *_F R A N C H_*
I literally just got a babish ad before a babish video
In the metric system liquids aren't usually measuered in gramms. In Germany for excample we'd say "150 Millilieter", not "150 Gramm" :)
Great episode Andy..🥰
Babish, we need to cook....  Walter White probably.
Anyone also just get through watching Breaking Bad?!? What timing 😂
I've always wanted to see your take on foods from Chowder, especially the foods from the fake Gazpacho commercial they made
Instead of flour, what about potato starch? (BTW, any thoughts about recipes from Midnight Diner on Netflix?)
Heya boss. Do the chicken fry with a dry rub. No eggs. Corn starch is the key
Do snake juice and/or blueberry wine from Parks&Rec
something about the music is very nostalgic
Hey babish it's been a while since I watched your vids but you should do carols acorn and beet cookies from TWD
The "we also don't want the batter to be so thick that we can't retrieve our bags of meth" killed me😂😂😂😂
Clicked on babishs video to watch babish only to get an ad with babish in it. ok then.
I thought the intro was a real ad from youtube lol.
Nice recipe 👍🏻
When he says “we” who is “we”
I have just asked my mom for fried chicken because of POLLOS. It's like you read my mind!
BlendTec references still going strong
Use a big wok for frying. Less scary than an iron skillet
Did anyone else get a Babish ad? Does he own a liquor company??
I got an add with BwB in it at the stary of this video
Could you please try making Nick Millers sauce from New Girl s04e17????
0:55 Shout out Will It Blend!
why didnt he make... Ketchup!
Love that Will it blend reference "don't breathe this"
Do Kahn's burgers from King of the Hill!
Bro that intro felt robotic bro
Give us some air fryer recipies
I halved my deep frying fear by doubling my pan height.
Arby's fries are trash, your fries look good though
You should experiment with the foods from Chowder, I'd love to see you interpret them and make them fun to cook
Got the Babish hidden valley ad at the start of this video
do the travis scott burger
This is illigal  I just finished my dinner Nooooooo.......
I got Andrew’s ad for hidden valley before this video lmao
Won't that be a KFC or McDonald's chicken?
I don’t want to be difficult, but how exactly does one “hand forge” a botanical?
How can one fried chicken looks so perfect for that thumbnail?
YESSSS
Mr what we need cock methé for gosteov frung
no way I'm gonna buy a spiralizer, but will DEFINITELY try that seasoning method on boring fries.
I swear I just watched the “What up biatch” video then I saw this
Say my name
OK, know do the other famous recipe
I love Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. I was hoping to see a Pollos Hermanos episode from you at last
Was that a will it blend reference? Haven’t seen them post a video in a while
I got a Binging with Babish ad before watching a Binging with Babish video.
This is the quality content I subscribed for, completely unironically
I literally just got a binging with babish ad on this video
I can't believe he hasn't made this yet
Did I really just get a commercial with Babish in it on this video? Yes. Do I love it? Yes
Holy shit, a Will It Blend reference at 0:55?!  This hellfire of a year just got a tiny bit better!
Ever plan on doing an Arby's episode?
was waiting for this one
He threw a “will it blend” reference
Did anyone else get a binging with babish hidden valley ranch ad?
Look at me Hector!
Not bad, not bad at all.
That is some sexy chicken
Franch was the best part! :)
Watching someone deepfry in so shallow a vessel gives me anxiety hives.  >Get ye dutch oven if you must use cast iron (or similarly heavy ceramic), or I actually just use my soup pot.  Having the extra height to your cooking vessel makes it way safer, but as long as you aren't using a crazy tall stockpot, it doesn't inhibit your access to maneuvering the fried goods at all.
just please , i want to see you make a rendang
Looks good except the fries in BB were not battered, but merely curly french fries. They filmed the restaurant scenes inside of Twisters in Albuquerque and used Twisters' own fries.
Jesse disapproves of this recipe.... No Chili P
That's a "freakishly small" whisk.
Yeaaah science !!!!
Did I just get a hidden valley ranch ad with babbish before a binging quoth babbish video?
Fried spaghetti
Cant wait to do this one!
Use a cast iron dutch oven instead of the skillet.  The peace of mind is worth it.
🤤
"Babish! We need to cook! Chicken and Fries!"
Ummm excuse me.. but could you try making a famous sweet and sour pork in anime.. from any anime would do
these curly fries, great, but you can’t beat daddy arbys
I like how everyone is watching Breaking Bad now since quarantine started. I finished this show in like a month.
Been waiting for this recipe since I subbed!
Cooking with fatty meat salad cooking with fatty meat salad cooking with fatty meat salad cooking with fatty meat salad cooking with fatty meat salad
react to how to basic plsss
Everyone says "Hey Babish" but no one says "How's Babish"
Can you make Tortellini?
Babish:"Deep Frying at home scares the shit out of me" *Adam Ragusea has entered the chat*
Hey Babish what do you think the Romani chateau from Majora's mask taste like? I mean I know it's supposed to be an alcoholic beverage but it's considered to be milk for some reason.
THE BLENDTEC REFERENCE
Please, please make the chocolate pie from The Help!
Mr white , there's meth in my chicken
What a great video to see after not sleeping all night. 6:45 am and I want fried chicken
Loved the “will it blend” reference
Understandable, have a nice day
Did I just get a babish hidden valley ranch ad before the video?
Tater tot episode 👀
"We also don't want the batter to be too thick that we cannot retrieve our bags of meth" I was like 'WHAT' oh wait yeah I remember that montage
Love the "Will It Blend?" reference! Oh and the food looked okay, good job I guess
Make a food from Gintama please.
Only Filipinos Can Understand:  America: Pollos Hermanos Philippines: Chicken Joy
I just had a binging with babish ad before this video.
I got your hvr add before watching this video what are the odds
This video will get 30 million views.
Hot tub of doom Hallo Iskall
“Potato mushroom-based prank” 😉
no joke half an hour ago was looking for a Los Pollos Hermanos recipe and couldn’t find anything then this pops up. how do you know 😮
Can anyone tell me where I can find that delicious Franch Dressing?
The perfect handheld food to eat as you make meth.
.nice
If we don't get a yule log style video of that fire place for Christmas I will be upset
you know that was your drool and not chicken juice coming from that first bite
I wake up to Babish making a Blendtec reference & now my day is going to be wasted wondering whether it will indeed blend
My family loves curly fries they swear they are way better than regular fries
Nice  It only took 8 years
Vat Of Death and Hot Tub Of Doom would both make awesome metal band names! 🤘
This guy's voice is like the bob ross for cooking
honestly man i love the shape of that pan
I appreciate the BlendTec Will it Blend reference.
The Thumbnail had me think it was a Jollibee ad SMH!
Okay, so how much vodka for the batter and how much for the chef...?
watching this with my gf! thanks
i appreciate the "will it blend" reference. classic.
next time cook meth from breaking bad
I just saw a Babish × ranch ad before this video lol
it's acceptable
You should cook some Meth (Pop Rocks) as Heisenberg.
Your choice of deep frying vessels gave me anxiety.
There goes their market
Imagine making food from a commercial in a show. Ok now let’s make that imagination into real because I’m hungy.
1:25 there isn't a link there tho :(
This was faster paced than usual. I thought I left it at 1.25x
my sister literally just got a spiralizer and has been obsessed
He should do a collab with Adam Ragusea.
Great! Now make the meth :)      For legal reasons, this is a joke.
Seeing gus that cheerful is terrifying.
Babish is gonna get baked for giving away Gus' secret recipe
I got your hidden valley ad before this vid lol
Didn’t laundry money while doing it 0/10
binging with babish make a shroud cappuccino
Why did Babish call coriander coriander? Normally he calls it cilantro.
Make some german dishes :)
Thanks Dad
I think I'll have a cup of coffee with this. Without the Stevia.
Make Chanko Nabe
Chicken is batter fried in scotland regularly 😋  its one of our national dishes. Along with batter fried sausage, pizza, haggis, blood pudding, potato slices (fritters), mushrooms, smoked sausage, pies, Mars bars, fish, King ribs, mock chops, chip stakes and other Scottish favorite like batter fried scotch eggs and barter fried pickled onions!
This is the moment that iv all been waiting for
You defo didnt put enough seasoning on the chicken
WaIt i thought they put lard int there oil
Ad with binging with babish in it ON A BINGING WITH BABISH VIDEO
The ad only ad I like on YouTube is the one with babish
Next: Homelander's Milk with Compound V
That pathetic sauce holder gave me anxiety
Anyone else get the Babish x Hidden Hidden Valley Ranch ad before the video?
The will it blend reference gave me flashbacks
I don't eat non veg still i watch his vids........they're just so pleasant and calming.
Can you do the cheap fried noodles with an egg on top from Beastars?
taco bowl and tac-os from Taaood
ONCE AGAYN 🥴
Really weird seeing a Ranch commercial with Babbish before a Babbish episode.
do meatghetti and spagballs from american dad :)
Can you make zuppa di pollo from mafia 2?
Please make leftover parfait from Malcolm in the Middle
0:55 Damn, that's an old reference. haven't thought about that channel in years. I wonder how many people on youtube these days even get it.
Tiny whisk to combine     Tiny whisk Ｏｎｃｅ　ａｇａｉｎ! 🙃
Why'd I get the BWB x Hidden Valley ad right before this?! xD
The S sound in this video makes this really hard to watch. You might want to tweak your audio
You gave us spiced fried chicken and curly fries, then promised tater tots with kick ass green sauce! Say less.
Breaking bad is the best show ever made.
What a great time to wake up to this video...now in hungry
"red chili smoke, don't breath this"  how old do you want me to feel babish because i feel 100
I got your binging with babish x hidden ranch valley commercial
Hey, babish Do the Microwave wings from Regular show.
How bout that frying with latex gloves on so they melt to your hand
Maybe you need to start deep frying in woks if your scared of Oil splatters, just saying
All the times he said grams mr white  had an orgasm
Please make the Cinnamon Rolls from Better Call Saul 🥨
Hey, if you're afraid of deep frying, don't put things in hot oil with a rubber glove on! The only thing worse than frying oil on skin is frying oil on top of melting rubber that's sticking to your skin.
Wow. Uploaded 29 minutes ago and alredy 75k views lol this ones gonna be big.
Walter cooking this now?
If your looking for ideas search up turbriskafil Big Bang theory its a turkey stuffed with brisket stuffed with ground turkey it might sound improbable but I think u can pull it off
"hot tub of doom" so accurate
Hey Babish you’re one of the best and most entertaining chefs I’ve ever watched well besides Jethro at our local Japanese steak house but he was just plain funny, thank you for what you do, your awesome sir.
Do we murder gustavo after the pollos or before the curly fries
I got a ad with Babish in it, I thought it was the video, he got me good.
Was hoping to see how you felt about coffee being the drink for this combo. Guess I’ll just have to do it myself 🤤
This is very cool, but now how do i make my own Crystal Meth at home?
the fact you salt fries with anything but chicken salt disgusts me
Mother Arby’s
I just started watching breaking bar again and I thought to myself "babish should do a take on that"
2:48 There goes my wiener.
Yooooo who got that fire Binging with Babish  x Hidden Valley commercial???!!!
Who remembered the Blendtek videos?
Please make more from Breaking Bad..❤️❤️❤️

Freakalicious ...
Babish: “ Hot Tub of *Doom* “  DOOM Fans: “ Did somebody say *DOOM* ? “
Always glad to see another episode of Baking Bad.
Do they even eat American style fried chicken in Mexico?  This seemed like a Latin twist on Popeye's.
do the banana and onion juice from Avatar!!!
I've never had THAT much juice in my chicken 😥😞
This chanell is very educational.
A hunter worthy meal from monster hunter
Spiralizer is a misnomer- it clearly makes them into helices
Did.....did you just quote will it blend
Imagine getting high from spices. (I tried snorting pepper once and it hurts my nose so bad)
Peep your own ranch ad on your vid
Tator tots from Venom?
Missed out on using the commercial and music from Kafkaesque
if anybody’s heard of a place called “Beef O’ Brady’s” , they have god like curly fries.
Jesser we nead to make methr
I just finished Breaking Bad last night and this is what I see on YouTube... :)!
Hey Babish please binge the boys and prepare the formula for Compound V.
Ngl I saw the thumbnail and thought banish was making a dog chew toy
I came here just to admire the perfect skinned chicken
Chilean cousine he said?
Yo shit, I just watched this show called Baking Bad and they totally ripped you off. They had a restaurant with the same name and even selling the same product.
Love the reference to Will It Blend
Gostavo would be proud i can assure you
The chicken needed like a few more minutes.
Breasts, thigh, Legs, wings...whats the last 2?
epic gamer
My dad loves tater totes
Love me some chicken snot
Instructions unclear, Accidentally started a meth empire
Ya Allah, I came to early..    the subtitle not published yet..
JESSER LETS GET SOME CHICKEN!
Wait... We are just now making this??
Chicken Brothers
Andy putting an ad with him in it before the video: brain 100
that chicken looks really good, Gus would be proud
You should make the pizza, then throw it on your roof.
Yes! Red pepper smoke! Digging into the deep lore of YouTube for references.
I always like how fast Pollos Hermanos serves my food, it's like it's right on the ding of a bell.
Wait, do people actually watch this to make it?
a
Always remember kids,  *FRANCH IS MEDIOCRE ON CURLY FRIES*
Tempura isn't thick Babish.
remember when you were on your tip toes around Molly? LMAO BTFO
I legit had your ranch commercial before the video
What if we want to be subject to antics?
5:12 Babish still confused by the wet hand dry hand method😂😂
You should do the ‘red barrow’ ribs from mr robot
I love the blender joke.
It actually offends me that he didn't show the version with the drug making sequence at the end
hey waiter, there is some blue crystal Meth in my fried chicken.
1:54 grams of water and vodka?
me and a buddy fry chicken together nearly every week and we're always working on making it better, every time the chicken goes in the fryer we look at each other "los pollos hermanos, tastiest chicken in de south" in the really over the top south american accent. This vid is perfect
Binging Bad!
This video is.... acceptable
YAYYYY FINALLY LOS POLLOS HERMANOS CHICKEN
next up, meth from breaking bad
Got a ranch ad by you before the video played
yes
TATER TOTS EPISODE?!
aaand, yet again Babish, one of your videos has left me craving fried food.. I'm trying to behave man!!   You should try your hand at bagna coulda btw. If im going to gain weight watching your video's, I want the solace of knowing your kitchen will never smell the same.
And remember guys try not to make the chicken skin too TIGHT TIGHT TIGHT.
DID ANYONE ELSE GET AN ADVERTISEMENT FOR POWDERED RANCH AND BABISH WAS IN IT?? Cuz I did and I was pleasantly surprised lol
bruh, I just got a binging with babish ranch commercial lol
Woah, a Will It Blend reference. I feel old now.
Can you get the Blendtec guy to do all your blending from now on?
Hi jmac
That oil pot please dont fill that to the top is really risky
If deep frying's scaring you, Ethan Cheblowski has a great vid about how do safely do it at home with an easy clean up. Basically it boils down to using a wok to help with splatter and the amount of oil used, and making sure you clean out the small bits that fall off in between batches to help avoid the smell.
Oh, so Andrew is an Arby’s guy.
A lot if kayenne pepper...someones watching chef john again
Does the name Pollos Hermanos bother anyone else? Surely it should be Hermanos Pollo
Babish, can you do Bensons microwave wings from Regular Show?
Wait, why did I get an ad with Babish in it
i am early
*unoriginal crystal meth joke *
Just got an ad made by Babish before this vid! Cool!
Appreciated the will it blend reference
Auto einai diko mou
Warning: may lead to half of face being torn off from an explosion attached to an old man with a death wish. Please consume with caution.
Loved the will it blend reference
Mushroom based prank. My god that gave me a good hearty chuckle
babish you should invest in a deep fryer.
Babish I would like to lodge a complain. I found chicken in my blue crystal.
A Blendtec reference, in this, the year of our lord 2020?
As someone who lives in Albuquerque (where they filmed breaking bad) it was so weird to see pollos hermanos cuz they used an actual local chain of burrito restaurants called twisters to film in. And they changed nothing about the restaurants except for the names. same interiors same menu boards same staff uniforms just fried chicken instead of burritos lol  Oh P.S. they do sell curly fries, and yes they’re delicious, smothered in green chile
Fried chicken gang represent!
Do fish fingers and custard from Doctor Who.
Why does raw chicken on a wooden countertop always end up making me cringe? ... I mean I Know he cleans it but (shivers) 👀...
My boi Babish over here salivating on his curly fries, marking it as "chicken juices" my maaan.
Babish pls do jamaican patties for basics with babish
Well we got the Blue meth episode now we have the cover up
I'm kind of disappointed that one of the ingredients was not meth.
2:45   Alright I was not expecting the mushroom potato  and not I can't stop laughing
here before 60k hell yeah
HE WHIPPED OUT THE FRANCH!!!!!!
Now we just need Mike's pimento sandwich.
"lets sniff the 'essentially tear gas'!"
Its my birthday today and i got a los pollos hermanos hoodie
Next up I want to see how to make meth in the kitchen.
Bruh using grams for liquids... FYI that’s the equivalent of saying something like, an ounce of water (solid ounce, mind you)
BROOO BABISH HAS A RANCH COMMERCIAL
Nice "Will It Blend" reference.
ohh hell yahh im early asf
Right before the video I got an ad with you in it 😂
Now that is crispy and tender
Yummm 😋 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
A 'Will it Blend?' reference in 2020?! I applaud you good sir!
I’ve always just breaded the chicken in flour/salt/pepper combo. May need to try this
Fun fact: I’m the 696th comment. *nice*

Perfect. Babish's Avatar always reminds me of Heisenberg 😂
When are you gonna do the "blue" treat from Breaking bad ?
I love the “Will it Blend” reference 😭
Is this 99.1% pure chicken?

I NEED AN AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE EPISODE
I live next to the twisters that thry filmed that at
the face of anyone watching this, not knowing the Plot of Breaking Bad. "did he say METH?!"
Clicked the upper right hand corner @ 1:26 and it just keeps pausing the video and doesn't send me anywhere.  Guess I'll be clueless forever FeelsBadMan
can u use tbs tbsp please
Wow I'm kinda early
When will you show us how to cook that blue meth?
What are the odds I'm wearing a breaking bad shirt and this pops up
hmmmmm are there any non-alcoholic alternative than vodka?
The fact that you didn't use the commercial from Breaking Bad for the intro is a travesty, and a crime against humanity
I'm satisfied with this video.
Was that a goshdarn Will it Blend reference in God's abandoned 2020?!!?
Is the voice actor banish?
Well time to make meth
Anyone else old enough to get the "Is it a good idea to microwave this?" reference?
Those curly fries look more like onion straws. So they’d probably kick metric tons of ass on a burger.
Gib tater tots
You should cook crack next !
make drugs andrew  create illegal substances
Got a botanist gin ad before the vid
I still miss the old kitchen, at least it didn't have an open fireplace in it
I started re watching Breaking Bad and i just crossed into season 3, great time to make these myself to enjoy the show with then
you know it's gonna be fire when the video has a Babish ad on the Babish video
He said Chilean?!?!   OMG, NEVER BEEN SO PROUD OF CHILE JAJAJAJAJA
do they have meth in them if they taste so good
Hi
A babbish ranch ad inside a ranch sponsored babbish video. I was too high for that.
I'm definitely trying the curly fries recipe!!! =D  You think you can recreate the meringue dessert Aunt Petunia made in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets??? ;)
When's the kitchen tour you lazy hack
is that the juices that comes from the chicken or from you mouth?
"What does family taste like"  My family's a bit salty.
TATER TOTS EPISODE COMING UP!!!
You are absolutely fantastic.
Normal chefs: “Ok now let’s talk about the chicken”  Babish:   N E G O T I A T E   T H E    C H I C K E N
*tiny whisk* to combine
It felt like crime when I saw his face on the reflection on the oil
At first I wasnt looking at my phone and thought I got another add
1:57 wait did He say 30g of vodka? Or did i turn into an alcoholic
Actually Sheetz curly Fry's are the best!
OH GOSH I HAVE BEEN WANTING THIS FOR SO LONG!! SQUEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
poop
I hope you used New Mexican red Chile...
Ahhhh measurments the whole world understands. Awesome.
Just finished watching Breaking Bad again for the nth time. RIP Gus Fring. Chicken legend
do pewds swedish bread
Finally! Gustovo would be proud of u !!!
Ah yes. The good music.
using a plastic glove around a hot tub of death is a bad idea
I bet this chicken is DA BOMB  also "Clown Burger" from Wasteland 3 should be a fun challenge
🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Can you start another series called "Broke with babish" where you make everything within 1-5$??😂😅
I request Fruity Oaty Bars from Serenity.
Me: Andrew's done with doing Breaking Bad dishes is he? Andrew: *We're done when I say we're done.*
Great now do the Travis Scott meal !
you could lower the music
this episode should've featured the chicken connoisseuer
A commercial starring Andy just before this?  I’m unsure if that was intentional.
So what your telling me is that Babish is such a big dog now that he has his own ads?
Is everything to your liking gentlemen?
2:18 At the point he placed the bowl with boiling water underneath the contraption, it felt like one of these machines the archetypal villain straps James Bond onto.
this is when walt became heisenberg
Babish : Click on the top right corner now   No link  Me : *So that we a f lie*
Still waiting for either big smoke's order or the meth from breaking bad
That Chicken: *is named Don Eladio Babish: “Don Eladio esta muerto!”
38000 views in 9 minutes we love you man👍🏻👍🏻
Why spanish tho? Probably because "Chicken Brothers" makes no fucking sense, so by using spanish at least you won't know you're talking nonsense.
I got an ad with him in it thanks YouTube I still kinda hate you...
4:55 why is "Mother Arby's" so hilarious
When you click on a Binging With Babish video and the ad at the beginning is also Binging With Babish
Bruh
What does family taste like in your heart you know its just your angry mom and dad with no one suporting you with a anoying little brother and sister and a older brother or sister that always told you to do something that they dont even do
jesse you brun RV with wrong ingredent@??
Don't forget the special blue crystals that make the batter so tasty
You can use a wide wok for deep frying to prevent big splatter of hell oil.
Instructions unclear. Ended up with a meth lab and a blown-up face.
1:42 look at the ovens on the right. Some one wasnt in the right place while filmings this lol
When are you going to do Frank Gallagher's Nectar of the Gods?
PACA PACA PACA EN MI CABALLO, Lalo Salamanca Approved.
*everyone liked that*
Whoa I got a ranch ad and you were in it
Just realized I'm really early this time
Kind of disappointed you didn’t wear a yellow polo shirt and a red apron... :(
Just got an ad for your partnership with hidden valley ranch before this video lol
you make me hungry every single time xD
I'm excited for the tater tots episode, now. I dipped some tots yesterday in an Alabama white BBQ sauce since it said it was good on fries, and I have to say, the tangy spiciness of the sauce was a good counterpoint to the savory tots.
I misread the title as "Binging with Babish: Pollos Hermanos from Bad Breakfast" lol
Me: deym, definitely going to try this Him: (brings out the potato spiralizer) Me: ok. I'll just continue watching.
I've never wanted to eat fried chicken more my entire life
Just saw your ranch ad before this vid, congrats my dude
The day has come, rejoice
hello. could you try out a norwegian dish called "pinnekjøt" it is a chrtistmas dish.
YES finally! I've been waiting for this episode for SO long. Have a like and subscribe and whatnot
FINALLY
3:07 I have never heard someone properly use" Betwixt" wow.
Pollos Hermanos is better than crack, I would know
Banish you should do Eminem’s mom spaghetti
Thought this was an old episode, trippy i started re-watching Breaking Bad today
Ahh so that's how you make noodles
make the pollos hermanos from binging with babish
All those Babish-branded cookware just hanging out in the video 👀
Hahaha! I got a binging with babish ad about ranch before this! 😂
I'm pretty sure that's drool not chicken juice coming off that drumstick...
Here I am in English class on zoom watch Binging with Babish... time well spent
Day 3 of suggesting Babish to make Benson’s buffalo wing chili from Regular Show
When are you going to grow your own spices?
I just got an ad, and I swear Babish did the narration.
Was that a will it blend reference with the spice grinder? 😏
BRUH I GOT A RANCH ADD WITH BABISH
Claim your here before  a million ticket here
watch food wars!!!! 😬
Get the hell outta here!! Hahah. Awesome video, man
i was waiting for this episode for so fucking long
Right before this started a hidden valley ranch ad with banish in it
You know, it's kind of rude the way you walk in front of the TV when we're watching.
When are you gonna make real meth you said that in the video from 2 years ago. :-\
I just got done with season 3 yesterday, perfect timing! This looks AMAZINGGGGGG
Should have done a baking bread breaking bad episode.
Please do ‘La Torta De Jamón’ From El Chavo
you giving me anxiety with t he amount of oil in that pan, dont fill over halfway
I won.
Damn that chicken drum in the thumbnail looks too good to actually exist irl
Today on "Binging with Babish", filmmaker Andrew Rea faces with a very particular challenge, as he shows you how to make Pollos Hermanos from Breaking Bad. We got a lot to take care of, so let's get cookin'.
Just a thought...."Breaking with Babish"
Anyone else catch that Will it Blend? reference?
Yee
The curly fries look like flamin hot cheetos went shopping...wish i cudve tasted em😭😭😭❤️❤️
Curly fries? More like curly meth alpha methylphenethylamine
"Breaking with Badish" missed opportunity, I'm disappointed.
Meth.
Is it always necessary to make a batter for curly fries? I’ve always wondered why one couldn’t fry curly fries in the same way they fry normal fries
A Babish commercial before Babish starts. Why doesn't this kind of accuracy happen more often?
Pollosh Hermanosh.
JESSE WHERE IS THE METHA
I don’t even care if these recipes are accurate, i just love watching him cook
Stopped every I was doing when I got the notification for this video, love babish and love breaking bad honestly been waiting since the breaking bad binging with babish special for another BB x BB video!
4:17 Adam Ragusea approves
I got a add with him along with the video
I keep forgetting what All Purpose flour is. Is it plain flour or self raising flour?
Mother Arby’s got me
Your videos are like ASMR ❤
Arby’s has some competition lol
Crispy Juicy
Let them block our arteries
Did anyone else get the hidden valley ad with Babish?
Where are the 'secred blue ingredient' comments?
👍
God, that "Will It Blend" reference reminded me I'm old
Huh looks like Jollibee chickenjoy to me
You had me at Arby's.
Hey @babish have you ever been burnt
The fried chicken on the thumbnail looks smooth
The spiral larger is looking like fried ramen
Glorious! Excellent recipe. Merken is a Chilean smoked pepper spice blend that will really punch up future recipes. Def worth tracking down
“Red pepper smoke. Don’t breathe this”  You been on the internet too long if you remember watching Blendtek videos and hearing my man say “_____ smoke. don’t breathe this”
At first I thought I read "Pollo Hermosa", which would be "Beautiful Chicken" in Spanish. Given the result, that serendipity at work.
make something from my hero academia
A Binging with Babish ad on a Binging with Babish video. Nice.
Literally just got an ad with Babish in it before this video
You have got my mouth watering with this one sit
Imagine if babish actually pinned this comment. :)
Always happy to see more breaking bad
Hey Babish, do you think you might want to do an episode on making cordial for Basics with Babish?  I'd love to see if you could make it homemade!
No upper right hand clicky button. :(
everytime i watch a BWB video i see Andrew in an ad for Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing. I only see them before his videos. Is this happening to anyone else?
Ah yesss. Finally!
Was waiting for Giancarlo Esposito to appear at the end and review the food
Ah yes, the chicken from Breaking Good
He finally made it!
What the suitable ingredient to change for the vodka??
i-card did not show up for full chicken breakdown. I've already seen it and loved it but others might be confused
Cool, got the Babish Ranch ad before this video. Time to binge this video about chicken from Breaking Bad.
"Hey baby I hear the blues a calling tossed salad and Crystal Meth "
"They're so good they will blow half your face off"
Bro I was just in the middle of watching breaking bad when this dropped.
His pfp looks like Heisenberg
There's a reasons the will it blend guy tells you not to breathe it, he breathes everything he blends, took 10 years off his life.
Instructions unclear, chicken turned into blue powder, please advise?
Mother Arby's
those fries look fucking unreal right now
I was literally just done roasting a chicken from a basics episode and this pops up... I guess I'll develop some chicken wings before I know it.
Like for potato mushroom!
The Chicken in the thumbnail looked like a toy
I just made chicken last night ..  why Babish why?
epic
You gotta fix the thing in the upper right corner of the video. It doesn't appear
I fear the tater tots episode lol. Are you gonna make a babish version of the tots, the sauce, or the defibrillator?
Your frying pans are way too shallow. It works but the oil can bubble over and cause a fire.
Everything just looks perfect, What camera do you use?
Heisenberg lunch pack please ;)
It would be funny if you made meth but end up with chicken at the last step
Will It Blend? Deep cut YouTube reference there Babby.
Also, I've liked that meth reference. Keep up the good work 😃
Mr white I require methe
You have to recreate the dessert from the departed
I thought this was 3 years ago
are home deep fryers just not a thing in the US? no one seems to have them
okay but when will you start making meth from that show
made on my birthday. nice.
Where is the link on the upper right corner?
hey Babish you forgot to link the 10 chicken part thing  1:18
Anyone know what kind of paper towels he used?
This goes perfect with my morning.. ugh meth
I got your ad before this video lol
How tf do you have a spiralizer but you dont have a cheap deep fryer?
FINALLY
When are we gonna see some food from Futurama?
Roof pizza
Breaking bad is the best show ever change my mind
el pollo KFC que hicimos para NUESTRO CANAL❤ esta mas rico🤤
As much as i want another season of BB im so satisfied how it ended
you should try to do heavy's lunchboxes from tf2
Are you sure there's no ricen in them don't wanna end up like Lydia
I love the freeze frame at the end that shows that long string of chicken water. Thanks Babish for making me laugh at 8 in the morning
Oh hey time to rewatch the whole series for the fourth time thanks babby ffs
Babi you don't need to say freshly ground pepper and kosher salt every damn ass fucking time
Bruh I've never watched breaking bad before in my life, but there is a restaurant near my house that is also called "Pollos Hermanos"
WARNING!!!! chicken may or may not contain meth
wheres the link in the upper right hand corner
The background music kinda sounds like the better call Saul theme from Lola Marsh
6 mins aired and 210 comments....srsly? 😅😝
Follow-up comment: what episode was this from?
Nice.
"click the link in the top right corner now" oh wow thank you
Ding Ding Ding, welcome to Pollos Hermanos
Tatter tot episode?! I look forward to that!
*starts ringing a bell from a wheelchair*      HUUUHHHHH!!!!!!! (Boom).....
This is the best METHod for making chicken
“Jesse, you asked me if I was in the meth business, or the money business… Neither. I’m in the empire business.”
You should’ve worn the pollos hermanos uniform
I really hope I wasn't the only one that got the BlendTec reference at 1:00
Next time make saul or whatever havent seen the movie
Goof
We love fried chicken here
Not as much meth in this one as I would've liked
CatDog Candy. Please.
0:54 Dat "Will it Blend" reference tho <3   Where does the time go...
Make Garlic Ice Cream from Phineas and Ferb!
Anyone else notice breaking bad is making a comeback on social media and stuff?
Can you please make the monk fish turkey from Malcolm in the middle?
Yay. 6 minutes since upload. Never been this early.
Random question are you a voice actor cause you sound like Judah from bojack horseman
Intro: What does family taste like  Me: “Thinking abou Phub intro ”
@Binging With Babish Would you ever do an episode on different types of batter?
I'm so happy you did this! I suggested it to you when El Camino came out! Yay!!!! So yummy
I thought it was 5 months ago lol , and it was 5 minutes ago so many new comments lol.
Is this show worth watching? From what i’ve heard it’s 50/50 The people who like it, absolutely love it and the people who don’t, really dont
jesse where is the cocainer?
"click on the link on the top right corner right now"  There is no link  I've been lied to :c
I witnessed a Babish upload? my word.
Potato mushroom.
Hands down one of the greatest tv series EVER! ❤️😁❤️ THANKS for this recipe! I just uploaded my fried chicken recipe and it is KFC style 🍗🍗 hope you love it 😁😁
Guacamole hat from despicable me 2
1:25 that didn't work today
CHEF "BABISH" : "And as always if it's wednesday its Babish"
When will we see food from silence of the lamb when ?
Your goddamn right
I have never been so early!
Deep frying is EVIL
You should have titled it Breaking Bad With Babish.
At los pollos hermanos, someone is always watching
Ight i might make this for breakfast tomorrow
Arbys curly fries are s tier
I see this was just uploaded and already over a thousand likes and views, good for you keep up the great vids
Comparing cutting potato strings to manscaping caught me slightly off guard. With a bit of puke in my mouth.
You should make those burritos Tuco made. Hold the poison, tough.
Gotta do a Twin Peaks episode... the pies 🥵
0:56 we love the throwback
Already addicted
"Don't breathe it in." Of course my man babish would know not to make that a liability right??? Right???
I still miss the other kitchen
don't breath pepper... I once went to smell some red powder from a broken spice thing thinking it was paprika (I wanted to confirm) but it was actually cayenne. Needless to say, it was a bad experience when some got in my nose.
Yeet
Why is there no link for the 10 piece tutorial on the top right?
I never even saw them, but I always wanted to try the hot dogs from the spot where all the biker gangs and meth dealers would hang out
*_Kokahina_* is the secret ingredient
Huh, Chicken Brothers.
Instructions unclear. Ended up with crystal meth instead
Lol
Videos till Babish notices my comment (10) : On April First Next Year, he should make the Bread-Free Toast recipe from The Fairly OddParents (Search it on google and imagine how he recreates it or “makes it better”)
I enjoyed the Will It Blend callback. 😊
Did you ever do Paila Marina from 'Breaking Bad'?
5 minute gang <3
(The secret ingredient is meth)
This is the kind of thing that is so absurdly mainstream that I would have thought it would have long been Babished by now. I'm happy to be wrong, though. 😁
hey confetti bomb guy you seeing this bro?
Will it blend 😎
If you go to the drive threw make sure you don’t get a Chicago sunroof
“We have to make everything” Guess what my tired ass though was meant
Don Eladio and Hector disliked this
Can you make the ice born platter from Monster Hunter please ?
What's your fav rolex?
Make Vari Cakes from The Legend of Korra
So good it will blow your face off
The early dislikes are the people who are mad Babish called the tiny bowl a “cup”
"We also don't want the batter to be so thick that we can't retrive our bags of meth" Ok Babish, I don't think those bags are mine
Literally bingeing this show for a third time and now i have a recipe yay
Uhh from Breaking Bad ***and*** Better Call Saul.     S'all good, man.
I am looking for a good recipe for spare ribs do you have something for me and I really like to see your vidios every time you make something I really want to taste it hahaha
Anyone else got a Botanist ad and thought the vid started during the ad?
Ah next time we might get 'how to cook meth' haha
0:55 Babish did not graduate from the school of Will it Blend.
Every time your voice floats over my speakers, my 19month old daughter comes SPRINTING. 💕 yours is the only male voice she likes besides my husband, so thank you. 💖
Another banger babish 🤙
What if he put crystal meth in the chicken?
Less than an hour ago I saw an ad for ranch or some sauce that had babish in it
Imma be honest, I was expecting you to do different type of "cook" from Breaking Bad
Thank you! Will try this one tonight. Maybe post it to my channel too.
Protein blocks from snow piercer :)
Next episode pls make the best chicken and rice
You should try cooking tamales

You should make Marge's Cupcake from Simpsons episode, "What Animated Women Want"
Brings a whole new meaning to *binging with babish*
When you’re so early there’s no “link up there in the upper righthand corner”
F R E N C H
I only watch. I can’t cook 😑
I wonder who dislikes these but comes really early
Boy you didn’t link how to break down the chicken! (Great video tho)
I've only seen like a few episodes of the show so I was surprised about the Dentist from Payday 2 showing up.
Here i am again trying to make a comment that will attract attention
Any tips on how to clean a fryer to make it acceptable?
Wasn’t convinced of the crispy texture until the tiny whisk graced us with it’s presence. That’s all of the validation I needed
" To the early squad that's reading this"  Sending virtual hugs to anyone who needs it. Stay safe and positive 🤗😇  Mr beast commented on my video I am literally crying and shaking😅

Idk why but I just love watching Babish talk menacingly while cooking
Reduce the bass on your voiceover track, this narration is incredibly boomy and distracting.

The “will it blend?” Blend tech blender reference is golden
The moment I’ve been waiting for.
Nice, vodka chicken
curLY FRIES
Please make Khao Niew Bing from Amphibia
This recipe looks great, can't wait to try it and Blow my guests' faces off

Oh HELL yeah, new Babish video.  If you want to try a simple but delicious dip (sauce?) for fries of any kind, mix 3 parts mayo with 2 parts ketchup. In Utah, we call it fry sauce, and it's incredible.
He is making fanart of food
Instructions unclear. Ended up with my pizza on the roof.
the person below me is a bot
Next up- Lou Will wings from magic city
Hows it hanging andrew

Suspiciously little blue stuff in this episode.
I'm surprised it took so long to feature this
"Uh, I've got this weird blue crystals in my chicken, can I get another one?"
yoom
I want the blue crystal as my desert😎
I forgot that the ad was in the show, and I was very confused for 10 seconds
This has been posted seconds ago and people are already here wow
Omg I love Gus Fring so much
Bruh
Earliest I’ve ever been to a vid that wasn’t set for a premier release

Hey Babish I appreciate what you do, it’s entertaining as well as inspiring, thanks sir
