The guy has an incredible sense of humour. I really wish the best for him

fair play
Tiger seal without a pause killed me 😂😂😂
been doing vinyl for a couple years now just got into wrapping and tucking is the hardest thing for me..
Love the videos 💯
bro is just eliminating future competition
Good colour
It might not be a great job, but I love that colour!
You tried to hide it, you can’t hide that fucking haircut mcwankshaft
Ginger 🔔end
Jesse mcwankshaft absolute 🔔end
“I wouldn’t trust him to put a screen protector on my phone” 💀😭
@Yianni, get these guys inside, with a  heat gun and good vinyl and lets see if it improves his wrapping!
Honestly this was one of the best videos on this channel. Had me in stitches the whole time
Talk about a one trick pony! Why would you want to cover your car with fablon?
That was best of your videos Yianni😁 this is what i like- honesty, giving advices, asking questions, fair play to Jess for wrapping car 1st time ever outside and in rain, would be great to see him wrapping next car inside and using different wrap, i was thinking to wrap only my car( never do it for living) but after watching this video - when i do it- i wont tell anybody as it might be worse than that corsa😂( dont get me wrong i love that colour).
Ahh, Yanni, I love your Banter buddy. I love these videos. Really entertaining but educational st the same time. 👍🏼
The corsa guy took it to an expert. He knew it would be scrutinised beyond belief. Fair play to him for not only having a go himself,but for doing a decent diy job with bad materials,no experience and outside. You get what you pay for,but the guy was a good sport and yanni was  being honest.
Get Matt Armstrongs new 911 gt3 in to review his wrap
Would you to see you two continue with this shed of a Corsa. Maybe let him wrap it inside with some decent materials, see if the finish is any better after your feedback!
Its a 30 meter wrap job by that i mean it looks okay from a distance 😂
Did u wrap it properly for him tho after
"should be" looooool
More making tape than the wrap 😂 but if it was my attempt there would be more making tape.
More masking tape than the rap!?
For a first time and being done outside as a DIY I’ve seen a lot worse 😂 well done 👍
I would love my roof to be done but can’t afford yans prices but he is the best
Need to do one of these with matt armstrong that will be a good video
Surprise him with a wrap!!!
Rahhhh that’s awful in proper light. For a car guy aswell 😂 I wrapped my bmw f30 in camo and it’ smashed this 🤦
Yianni just had a question, when is your revuelto delivery expected?
Yanni you suck 😂 , how come you haven’t franchised yet so rest of us in other countries can  have your experience
Out of five yeah😂😂😂
Video 2, yianni gives him a days wrap lesson in his shop then video 3 is him wrapping his car again with the new skills
Mad respect to Yanni and his team for collaborating with a smaller YouTuber!! Great video!! Feel good vibes for sure! 👌🏾
Lol this was so fun to watch! 4.6/5 bahahahha! :D
The color is not great for the car.
Question, would you wrap that Corsa if it was bought to your company?
Yan I love your wraps, I've got a 2013 focus st but it's the estate it needs wrapping, what you saying
Watched jesse since his corsa d(also my first car)   Didnt think id see a corsa again 🤣
This guy has some balls to get roasted by Yianni 😂
Wouldn’t let u put a screen protector on his phone😂😂😂
Credit to him for trying at least and allowing the goat to rate it! It would've been cool to have one of the Yiannimize wrappers there to redo one of the panels to show him in person how to tuck the vinyl etc. Sometimes learning from watching videos and listening to a pro can help, but seeing someone do it in person is priceless.
yianni is so knowledgeable it's unreal 👑
I think he just tried first time job w/o any pro skills and educate and I belive he can do it better for second time!
“ I wouldn’t let him put a screen protector on my phone” awwww killed me
Great video! The level of quality control that Yianni does is insightful. I have only had my car's roofs wrapped because I was not trusting of the Wrappers around me. The comment regarding quality of the vinyl is also a huge insight that the average person on the street would not consider as the wrapper will say the brand name and stand by them. After many years of following teh channel I now have an even higher respect for Yiannimize and Fillimize.
I’m really good with applying film screen protectors. Does that mean that I could wrap good?
This will be a sick little series 👌🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Terrible if I'm honest
Crazy, but yianni has never made a step by step guide for beginners to learn wrapping (Not too detailed, but like a nice overview.) Would watch it over ANY other video
What brand of film was used? Didnt hesr it get mentioned
This Is my new favourite series. Yannie with the bangers👌🏼
Honestly, it’s a decent diy job. If he were to do it again, he definitely would learn from his mistakes and a do a better job on the next car…hopefully
😂 I wouldn't let him put a screen protector on my phone
😎😎😎😎😎😎
Love this, looking forward to the next episode
loo he really did think it was a good job
I'd love to start doing this with people who think they can detail a car.
Tell us the price difference between wrapping your self and yianne wrapping, probably huge difference,so if you not that picky better off doing yourself.
Yianni should have unwrapped one panel, and guide the owner on the proper way to wrap it.. He’ll see the before and after and why wrap costs alot
4.6 out of 5!!!! Brilliant 😆😆
Take Jesse on for some work experience would make some great content
what did he pay and what would ya have charged is the question?. Biggest issue we have (coming from a shop owner and in game for 10+ years) is competing with back yarders and alas 90% of people will go the cheap option not the best first. I loose more work for wraps for that alone.
Yianni almost wrapped the whole car again with yellow tape 😂
To be fair to Jesse, he’s pretty chill and personable. I’m sure his next attempt will be better.
My wraps are always TT
Ngl, that corsa suits that colour
The real Yan fxxk urban just saying what the fans are thinking hope not
🫡
This guy funny af
Nice video yan x
After watching it all I loved this vid  be a great watch for other YouTubers and wrappers to have a go and get it rated
The look on Jesse’s face when you head in to check it out 😂😂😂 great collab guys excellent watch ❤
This guy was such a good sport. Yanni, you should offer him some training and show him how it should be done.
4.6 out of 5 yeah, that made me crease nice one Jesse 😂
Yianni should do a wrap on his urus himself
I’m kinda confused? Is the north London shop still open? Wasn’t this filmed in North London not MK?
Ive been brought here by Jesse, great video nice to see Jesse Collab with you
Waste of money on a scrap corsa and looked better before it was even wrapped
"it's the time of the year" 😂😂
Fine tooth comb, not fine toothpick 😂
This geezer is funny and quick with his banter.  Love the video and can I say welcome back yanni I hope your all better now and your family are all blessed big love Cee-Jay 👊💙👊
That was pretty good fun tbh
Can see that a 5 year old has done it 😂😂😂😂
Quality personality Jesse
He did better than some people who call themselves 'professionals' here in Florida. We have some shops that do such a horrible wrap job that they've been sued and had to change the name.
That's a frickin Tata Indica rebadged version, seeing it for the first time 😮
Love to see u rate one of matt armstrong wraps
Hey guys the cc subtitles might wanna edit them it’s coming up at the start 0.37 with a word instead of “rate” when they talking in the intro,   YouTube doesn’t like that word and they can shadow ban ppl with the word might wanna change it to rate if you can x
could see a 3 piece series where yianni takes him to filimize to 'intern' for the 2nd vid, then rewrap his car & present to to yianni for the 3rd.
Yianni is a legend, Jesse was a great sport and his excuses were hilarious. Such a great video 👍💛
Moral of the story, people do it for a living. Leave it to them 😂
Hope you made is a regular part on the channel
I feel a part of this - i may or may not of said on Jesses first wrapping video that Yiannimize had mentioned you in his video.. which he did not lol. 😅
Remember that CLS you unwrapped years ago?????
I wrapped mine myself too. Maybe ill drive down to yianny too 😂
Do a 1 off show of people who have neva wrapped have a wrap off  put 100 down ill win looks simple time and patience key with cars
Basically, it looks shit. I cant believe you were happy with this 🤔😬😬
Tbh it's better than the white bentley that came to you for the rewrap before
I'm really tempted 😂
We need a Matt Armstrong rating on here
Well.. he at least wrapped his own car and finished it.. that alone is more than many of us done.. but the little more attention to details and less rushing would make it a lot better... I wrapped a whole car and it was not easy.. but you can make a lot better finishing even on your first attempt by simply not rushing and take your time with every edge and corner.
I've actually SEEN WORSE! 7:38  It's a 10ft car maybe 20 feet or driving by lmao 8:20
Good video, liked hearing what Yianni noticed.
Love yur vids yianni also please like this comment pls
I will be back 😂🤘🏼
a bit early
