4:02 absolutely majestic i must say
for those who made it themselves or know the theory, does input voltage to the circuit affect the frequency and/or amplitude of the sine wave?
It is called a swearing button not a f****** button
Mehdi just roasted us 2:20
Holy fuck 0:57
hmm man see,man do,bleep bleep
10:40 Morse code?
4:56 You can tell this is ElectroBOOM.  Look at all the burn marks on that breadboard!
Lot of *beeps* later 😂
8:50 Or 8:51 or 8:52 0r 8:53
this truly erected my bulge
Amazing video
😂 9:57  lmao from there ….
What did you say!?
W&#!$% are you doing that right stop it now you are getting arrested stop making a &#!$% Button
4:37 my dog started barking when he did that
w singing
Electroboom doesn't need the button. He IS the button.
8:49 And that’s why kids, never leave live wire unattended
2:32 TIDE!?!?
😂😂😂
"hi, today i'd like to make a fucking button" like literally a fucking button that fucks everyone?
Subject: Oscilloscope Giveaway Request from a Student/Inventor in Pakistan 🙌⚡  Hi ElectroBOOM Sir! 👋  I’m Sultan, a passionate BS Physics student from Pakistan and a DIY robotics and electronics lover. I’m building crazy things with Arduino, ESP32, and NodeMCU (sometimes they even work before catching fire 🔥). But there’s one thing missing in my lab – a real oscilloscope.  I’ve been surviving with an old DT33B multimeter and trying to squeeze waveforms out of microcontrollers — but let’s be honest, that’s like doing brain surgery with a spoon. 🧠🔧  I’ve seen you generously gift scopes in your videos (with a few sparks included 😅), and I was wondering... if you ever have a spare one lying around (even with minor burns), I’d be honored to have it as my first real scope.  It would seriously boost my learning and help me build better circuits (maybe even shock-proof ones someday). 😄  Thanks for being an epic inspiration and educator – your humor and sparks are unmatched! 💥⚡  Best wishes, Sultan from Pakistan 🇵🇰
just use buzzer
02:56
You will burn down the house 😂
Programing Arduino is easy
Not me 2:54
It looked like he did it intentionally by slamming his foot against the table.
9:45 nice singing brv
5:38 8:40 Song name?
What do you mean pant?
Pls make me one i Will give you 100 dollas
A fk**ing button 🤣
quickly learn how to program an Arduino
Arduino is the king . Instead of thinking of complex circuits, just program an Arduino
10:40, Also a form of swearing in Mexico
Be careful with those things
If he wasnt a youtuber he would be a opera singer
Medicine Bottle? More like Mehdicine Bottle!
Use 3x 1.5v AA batteries😊
2:22 Every teacher
in the 1800s my family had "beep" but sadly you cant buy it anymore
drug bottle?!
You have a 3d printer yet you use a drug bottle xd
8:52 oh shit
8:51 the board like bye-bye😂
1:08 my deep thinking mechanism that I can't control either
8:05 YAY, somthing beggins to happen! I thought that this video is shit.
When you’re too lazy to swear
2:03
The high note reminds me of monkeys 😂😂😂😂😂😂
2:55 neyaaa😅
8:51 Did the resistor catch on fire, and then it ignited the tissue?
Once someone told me, "You wake the fuck up tomorrow, get your shit together and finish what you started or I'll the slap the shit out of you", and I told him, "Who the fuck you think you are trying to dictate my fucking life?" And he said, "I am you".
10:41 shave and a haircut two bits
hmmm that aint a 57578/ll' button its a morse code made out of scrap
8:51😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 bruh ain't getting house insurance
What???It really is boring. And it's easier to just put a battery, a button, and a buzzer in series and the same thing! You are really an idiot! Using a speaker and many complex circuit are not recommended
Oh yay he hasn’t gotten shocked today looks back 8:52
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUeN6LZNPVQ
Who in 2025. My favourite part of the video was the part where he said excluding me I guess😊😊😂😂😂
I love at 8:10 that he blows up to prevent the smoke detector from going off 😂.
8:51 fire fire😂
5:28 Mmmm drugs.  💉  I mean, say no to drugs kids.  👶
Monkey moment -> 4:11
8:49:  What went wrong: Medhi wiped down the circuit with alcohol wipes and left the wipe on top(?) of the circuit.  When he turned it on, it created sparks that ignited the alcohol causing a fire.
🤬🤬
I don’t care if he set up the bonfire bread board it was funny as hell
I don’t care if he set up the bonfire bread board it was funny as hell
Very simple I guess  9:35
8:49 he made a pillar of flame
8:50
you make a FUCK button
5:29 What drug bottle mehdi are you addicted from drugs 🤨🤨
I like youre fucing button
you can use it as a morse code
2:59 that face and the "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
You know you are going to laugh when the capacitor comes😂
Mehdi just casually performed the most difficult opera song for fun😂
9:50  sigma level 😂
Imma be honest…I’m not proud that I heard this out of context
10:37 pure electroboom energy
2 seconds before: “YOU DON’T KNOW A DANG THING ABOUT ELECTRONICS 🤬🤬🤬”      2 seconds after: “we do electronics😊😊”
0:02 and they say Canadians don't swear 🙂🙂
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬#@-=:@<#<#*@×##$#******#
People who got drty minded
thanks for making this! i can finally #### in public!
6:37 what is Mehdi doing here? How does this frequency response work? Is it making the speaker produce different frequencies & seeing what the gain is? How would an enclosure effect the gain of a circuit? Is he using a sensor at the top/output of the enclosure?   Edit: ok a couple seconds later when he talks I see fluctuations in one of the sign waves as he speaks. Is he speaking a bunch or using a microphone producing different frequencies so that it can test the different frequencies working on the speaker in reverse (so that when he speaks the speaker produces power with a piezoelectric like effect) and the oscilloscope is measure the fluctuations? Also sorry if this doesn’t make the most sense. I’m writing this very fast while being very tired. Sorry.
Is no one going to talk about the fire?
Till  from 0:00 to 0:25 is very sus without context
10:06:  That bleep sounds like the GM buzzer from the late 80’s early 90’s.  How nostalgic!!
When I hear a censor sound I always assume the most vile, filthy words that fit the context.
He makes learning a lot easier
He's saying bad words
I just made a bleeping button to and I use it in my videos to thank you 😊😊
Why doesn't he use buttons and batteries and buzzers?
2:59 3:00
The first 40 second are mad tuff
8:49 oh s***
8:30 is hilarious, he even accidently says "pant"
10:38
This whole video is a question with high quality (1080px HD) 😂😂
I swear. I swear….
Hi Medhi ! I just have one question, Can you reply to me a download link of the circuit schematic ?... i always wanted to make my own (*@!#$%^&;"/) buzzer button. So if you can, please try to reply a schematic link to me...
4:07 Bro is somewhere else 💀
Bud had to risk his life for that lol. 😂😢
2:59 bro is a legend for that
mehdicine bottle
8:49 electroboom before the disaster:  👍
I'm watching these videos so much, that I'm having sympathy shocks
At the start of the video Mehdi hadn't made the button yet so he must have been making the noise with his mouth
1:00 Electroboom completely disputes censorship in less than a minute.
how to code in javascript?
Iam a engineer too
🥸
8:48 me trying to bake beans
Bluds table made out of vibranium
8:43 = Sparkles 8:49 = Fire
5:58 oh look! The return of ElectroCute! I hope she's doing well.
∴₸ᖋᒣᓭ ⚍ⅱ
Mother ##### Me: he said nig-
2:57 Ow wtf bro that's worse than any shock you've taken.
4:15 : that one friend leaning his chair in class
10:36  I am *YOU.*  **EAS 1050Hz tone**
morse code
I wonder can you genuinely use a gun to make a heating pad
That’s funny electroboom became a singer 😂
It is a good project😀
خیلی دلم میخواد تیشرتی که تنت هست رو بگیریم ولی مسیر اینکه برام تو ایران بفرستن رو نمیدونم
what he doesn’t know is that h’es gonna get cancelled now for saying acoustic
Fire 🔥📛👨‍🚒🚒🧯🔥!!!!!!
oh hey! i might be acoustic too
Can't believe Medhi just dropped the N-word like a dozen times. CANCELED
I was expecting to press a f***button
WHAT DID HE SAYYYYYYY
did he just say DRUG BOTTLE!
Whats it called when Mehdi does drugs? Mehdisin
Fucking
I love when he starts off with “see here” as he hides under the table from his own work
Wow.  Electrocute's piano is really nice to listen to.
Yes!, Fuc* Arduino :0
4:00 Chicken dance!😂😂
i think it would be nice if it's connected to your mic. every time you push the button, it'll create the sine wave and mutes your mic simultaneously.
🇨🇦/🇺🇲... Saying "fuck" is speaking English. It's not shooting anyone! I get completely pissed that we can't express ourselves in plain English!
8:31 🤨
Mehdi, stop swearing!!!!!!!!!
Is it just me or is he covering his mouth every time he says bleep in the beginning of the video?
today we goin to make a beep buttom . WtF is  that ?
8:47  (turns around to grab his Keysight scope) (board catches on fire) Oh sh**
50 beeps in the video Not bad.
With that, he should probably make a musical instrument...
This whole video was an excuse to ear grape his viewers at 4:29
5:38 PLS SHAZAM
here is a 2:57 button ~ :3
Bro that Zauberflöte impression was so much better than the original❤️
Man faghad jahayi roo doost daram ke barghesh migire
and you can also use it for morse code, how convenient
0:44
3:01  gremlin medhi
Bleeping Button? is that what he is making?
That opera bit was actually really impressive
his doing morse code
8:45 nice little piano tune 😊        *cutely catches on fire😊😊😊*
I programmed an arduino for a button box  I had to make a button matrix with diodes to prevent ghosting It combined tech with electronics
4:15 you sound like Micky Mouse laughing
Funny
I really hope mehdi has a vent In the ceiling of his room xD
Cool. A Morse code device.
Been bringing this channel for a week now. I am now at the point where Mehdi sings Queen of the Night Aria. Am I surprised, taken aback, flabbergasted? No, not with Mehdi. Am I impressed, bewildered and happy to hear an electronics YouTuber perform a rendition at random? Yes.
8:52 made me laugh so hard
A FUCKING BUTTON
I was very confused in the beginning, I glad you cleared the bleeping out
2:13 Yeah, you can use an arduino. Useful? Yes. Fun? Definitely not. Arduino is better suited to more complex things.  2:27 Bro, for the love of god, just go the normal route. Just use a 555 timer to generate the frequency. Not some terrifying tesla coil frequency generator. Edit: Oh, it was just for a speaker.
damn Mehdi can sing better than i would have thought
Song name at 4:10?
I don’t know about you guys but this guy would be great with opera. “The electrooooodes”
4:02- Thanks for a new Ringtone :)
Urboyhydro_yt
I love it I can't stop watching Ur videos come test Australian circuits and get me zapped pls lol I'd love it 😂😂😂😂
I already beep instead of swearing
teh voice of a electrical angel: 4:01
Try to build something on a vibrating standing surface
I may learn from Curiosity Stream, but it could never be as entertaining as YOU ! !🤣
Bulge erected in the middle of our pant - Mehdi 2021
I am definitly NOT dirty minded
Man just wanted to be cancelled😂😂. Atleast it helps specially for those who had stress.
I have a question: did the frequency actually change on the circuit or is it just the mic posiioninig
I might have took a bunch of notes… and drew the diagram out…. And highlighted things..
Hey! He didn’t get hurt a lot in this one! Very proud 😂!
8:48 you definitely didn’t put flammable fluid on the board intentionally to make it light one fire 😂
8:50 like how he turns around then it catches on fire 🔥
Hi bleep😂😂😂😂😂
the beep sound of all videos for some reason it sounded like morse code :D
Keep bleeping as well it's shocking!!
A video with out shock or fire 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
you could only have use a buzzer with a pushbutton
Just call it a Berry F&S 12 DRAMS vial.
The Hector Salamanca Bell
8:51   circut is on fire
i could elaborate more on that transition from hard to soft 3:33 but you did instead linking hole size with max volume 4:45 :D and you keep going
ElectroBOOM? Nah... More like "OperaBOOM"
2:59  A part of me died
Great cursing 🤬 button
Or you can just use a buzzer
will the button become pregnant?
would you say your speaker is a Mehdi-cine bottle?
he sounds like a monkey singing that thing. good job :D
mehdi: *roasts CS people for not knowing anything about electronics* also mehdi: 8:50
When will everyone talk about Mehdi’s beautiful singing?
YOUR VOICE IS STILL HEARD in reality, although it's very weak
Are we not going to discuss how this man casually ran his foot into the leg of that table to make a demonstration…. I knew he would handle pain but damn even simulated that still hurts like a bitch.
your saying ****** this fu**king thing👺😡🤬
why is he the one that shows how you do it in a Goofy and dangerous way and funny way
8:49 you are on fire
Ngl I can't sing that good but my mom could have killed that in her late 20s
meanwhile in the Netherlands: *weatherman swearing with zero censorship*
this may well be the best BEEPing video in this whole BEEPing channel, and that's saying something
the entire concept of this channel is shown at 8:49
8:43 8:50
drug bottle whaaaaat
4.00 thus the talk box is born
Why I’m laughing at every moment, when he did this 7:12
Medhi is the Queen of the Night
I phot the plip was f**k.
Electroboom: Designs a circuit to make that sound. Me: Putting a multimeter on the continuti mode and putting a push button on the both ends of the probes 😎
Can we use a 555 timer in astable mode to generate pulse train and later convert it to SINE wave using RC circuit for generating input to the Speaker?
8:49 Nobody’s gonna talk about what just happened
Happy accident.
In the beginning, he really was talking about the swear word "f**k".  Which if you don't yet what does that word means...  Idk find out yourself...  But changes the topic immediately just to be safe.
What if you try a Physio
have you tried: 2x AAs, 1x button, 1x piezo buzzer? you can use a resistor to change the pitch, incase you wanted a supermarket scanner synth.
I have attended my first opera in this video and I can't be happier😊
Speekers, chambers... Why so boring!? I expected makeing sound using Tesla coil!
***k!!!🤣🤣🤣
Mehdhi Opera wonderful he is a genius 😍😍
5:16 No context
guys be aware that he is making a SHOCKing button
I just write the code man! Electrical Engineering seems waaaaay out of my league
Use f*cking instead of bleep 😂 0:01
I love the Arrested Development style ‘incidental’ mouth obscuring.
That intro had me crying
it get shock it this... while watching😂😂😂
2:59
…or u can use ur phone
I laughed how he noticed that there was a fire lol 😂🤣🤣
*Gets 3rd degree burns on finger* Mehdi: Dammit! I guess it'll grow back
ElectroBOOM lore explained
9:13 i know the definition of the four *BLEEPS* but i will not say 😂
3:58 that was actually good
Not boring useful.   Im making a display that counts to 1 million at 1 sec per sec on 7seg displays Trying coding and just discrete components.
0:01 i could imagine someone putting this out of context
BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP!
8:48 literally straight out of a cartoon 💀
I don't need a bleeping button, I can do it from my mouth!!!
It's quite entertaining when you can lip-read, haha
ok... i give this like just fot the "oh oh oh oh oh oooooooooooh"
Holy shit I feel vindicated.  I also do not know how to program arduino or code; learning languages is tough with dyslexia and ADHD. Code is just a language.  Playing with electronics, soldering? Sign me up!
P
I thought it would be a button that shocks you when you press it to make you swear.
I'm sad I didn't see this video when it was released because I just recently subscribed. I can't explain how much joy I felt (as a audio engineer and music producer) when I saw how much Mehdi understands audio. Even more so when the 1,000 Hz tone was actually 1,000 Hz! (At least until near the end of the video, where it changed to roughly 1,100 Hz, but I believe that's a result of the Triangle-to-Sine wave process, and it isn't a large tonal difference anyway.)
At 10:40 did anybody know what that noise sound like?
0:08 I know that people.... Rather than not.... Heat... Passion 😳
8:48 wow
A fucking button? LOl.
Because sometimes "gosh darn" or "you poopy head" just doesn't cover it.
Whoa i didn't know he could do that WOW 4:00
We can also send morce code
bro every time he turns away smt goes on fire xDDDD
At 8: 42 is crazy
@ 8.42 me in science
Was that The Magic Flute?!😂  Brilliant!
I will use premiere pro to make ***** sound 😂
Mehdi is really good at covering his mouth when saying bleep
*bleep*
But what was U2?  An op-amp, I assume?
From 0:00 to 0:31, he hides his mouth with his hand when he says bleep!!
4:02
Speaking Morse code
Very late, but did anyone else notice that when he was testing the bottom, each time he sweared, he perfectly places his hands over his mouth to visually sensor his words too?
i will say that in the end, the censor bleep seems to be emitting a tone that corresponds with a high C note instead of a high B as the standard censor bleep noise. maybe a different frequency? i'm a music guy more than a physics guy.
A chanel where the bloopers are shown of the making of every vídeo would be nice, specially i would have love to see the opera sing from another perspective
Why hasn't this channel overtaken t series rn
I'm pretty sure I saw an actual speaker in his bin of broken junk
mehdi swearing never gets old!
Dont set the house on fire.
Medi: *stubs his toe and screeches in pain* CC: [music]
This is nice, i already had Tinnitus, but its nice to hear you recreate it.
The funny parts for me 8:43 8:48 9:00
Just use a bleeper connected to a switch and battery 🤦🤦🤦
Zeev❤BOOM
8:49 when you look away from a yound child for 1 sec.
With that device, I hope that I could use that on Joe Pesci, Gordon Ramsay, etc.
Ears in pure silence:
I thought my tinnitus goes off
Just try a tweeter
8:29 to say I wheezed was an understatement. Im so childish
The boosting changer actually creates music boost sounds actually makes a sound features speakers can like a moving shape can make sound actually from the 2 wires that make sound1 of them sound like so Yeah
An LER, Light Emitting Resistor
I really appreciate the progression between electrical-electromechanical-electronics-PLC I can do electromechanical, and I understand ladder logic PLC (basically software version of electromechanical), but I can't do electronics or software worth a damn lol
ok that singing was impressive was that actually him?
He literally stub his toe
YouTube has become television!
&#!$%ing = bleeping
Bruhhh he actually stubbed his toe
No shit... I was researching a cirquit to convert a triangle wave into a sinwave and whatched this just to relax... thanks Mehdi...
2:12 Please forgive me god
9 E4.1£keisizuuza
I wish I was this smart
10:21 *BRUH*
"what is it good for? absolutely nothing! listen to me! ohhhhhhh!
The Waffle House has found its new host
watch a documentary instead of this? good idea
8:48 lmao was he cleaning it with alcohol and there’s was a tiny spark that caught the whole thing?
Dayum, Electroboom has opera skillz! 😂
Sorry, I couldn’t find the three thumbs up button. The singing was the icing on the cake. Thank you.
When he works in building something he looks less like genius creating something spectacular and more like Denis the menace comely focused working on something devious
Anyone here know what he meant by "frequency response"? Was he testing the speaker, but was the mic recording the speaker output or was it used for the speaker input. That confused me.
I need more electroboom singing queen of the night
10:06 Its not a pure sine anymore but it's ok.
Tabernak!
I like how he covers bis mouth every time he says „*******button“ and it seems like he just says „beeping“
Hilarious.

4:14 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fucking  good
8:48 pov: when you turn too much heat in your microwave
The bleep is an intense noise coming from a weird picture
Now i name it in russia because this is for english НАЖМИТЕ КНОПКУ, ЧТОБЫ СТАТЬ ГЕЕМ
Every time he tested with his foot switch, anytime he swore, his hand)s) was/were in front of his mouth. 🤔
8:47 Now Ya did it.......
It kinda sounds like a morsecode  device
I learned a ton, thanks
Get the BLEEP out of my BLEEP way!
Who the BLEEP is this BLEEP!
what
anyone else realize hes covering his mouth every time the bleep goes off?
i dont know why but the more you swear and the bleeps i hear the harder i laugh
4:00 😂😂😂😂
Man I love your videos so much. You would have made coding fun you teach that too. :)
At around 9:45 I was dying laughing at all four of his hands 😂
9:45 Love the "multiple hands" gag. x)
Nice didn't voicecrack while singing
10:17 The fact that he didn't even said the swear words ;-;
8:14 Me when doing literally anything that involves wires or cables.
Ho  good   #$%%%%%#$
This man can make a video about sowing clothes and I'd still watch it. Mehdi is too entertaining to watch, and educational aswell!
The fact that he mentioned Xbox One made me happy😮
i understand fucking button
TNice tutorials is aweso! I was feeling kinda overwheld when i first start soft but after watcNice tutorialng your tutorial video, i feel much more confident
#ForTheAlgorithm
Waiting for BlyatButton 😂😂
8:48 mehdi: "all good" and turns back on Fire: "hello there" Mehdi: notices fire "oh shit"
I want that crazy ass sound of the audio test as a text message tone now.
I had no idea you had such a great vocal range
11:22 ps just gets left out
you could just use a buzzer
This guy is soooo talented and experienced but soo random😭
I ■■■■ing loved this ■■■■ video !
imagine mehdi making one of these with planar magnetic speaker technology
But dont you have a bleep for @$#&_ing
this disposing I expected something more denger for that button 🔘 like for example to electric you or do self distraction or something
my like is for the singing. (and everything else)
I need one
welp, we have voicemod XD
Try to make shocking button.
I love this &#!$%ing so much! great singing coming from a musical background :)
You can just use a buzzer
I can reach a pretty high note until my voice just stops
Hold on... Anyone else hearing Kar98 firing sound when he stubs his toe?
2:59.04
2:59
I was sure you were going to use a 555 timer with the switch on the output enable
2:23
Sounds like you need a Mechanical Engineer to design your resonance cavity ;)
Beep
Thanks Mehdi, I got the discount for curiosity stream using your link 👍
4:02 he sounds like kazooie from banjo and kazooie
Bro 😯 those notes
Mehdi has get too old for electrical work.i am going to miss him when he will did
The singing was actually impressive. Dare I say... Shocking even.
Are you OK?
Very impressive singing and very synced with the music.
The final product was not 1kHz
I love how your videos are.
If you know programing you probably be embedding system genius.
mehdi, at around 9:14 i recorded and checked in audacity--your frequency varies from approximately 1.064 kHz to 1.089 kHz across these instances (window size 32768, type hanning, sample rate 3 kilohertz) acceptable drift for singular instances, but it's noticeable when they are back to back :[
If I don't know a 'damm' thing then I can learn them by watching your videos 🙂
+1 for the (acoustic) concerto !
what the bleep
You can use arduino programing
Linus got that in his podcast
you could use a 555ic its much easier to genarata 1khz with it
Shut up and take my $%&*ing money!!! where can i buy one of these
oh so i can say !$@&er?
The drawboard and the hands almost killed me 😂😆😂
stupid cameraman is censoring lol
I wonder why his battery powered circuit sounds different than the pure sine wave
Really good singing🤣😂😅😆🤪
I just love how at 8:51 a whole fire just happens and Mehdi turns around, realizes what's happening and is just like "oh shit oh shit !' had me dying lmao
if he made it shock him he could curse whenever he wanted to!
"Not a bulge eructing in the middle of our pant" *"band"*
he must have really good lung capacity after blowing out all those fires over the years 😂
sorry Mehdi for the first time you were wrong. It is true every speaker needs an acoustic chamber, so the back and forth sound waves don't cancel each other., And it is also true, that the chamber with a hole is a Helmotz resonator. But a chamber does not perform the function of an impedance matching device. to match the "hard" speaker cone with the "soft" air. ,That function is performed by the acoustic equivalent of transformers, guess what it is: The horns. That's why horn loaded speakers have much better power efficiency than simple speakers, it goes from like 5% to 40% efficient. Because horns improves the power transfer by making a better impedance matching. According to dynamic analogies, acoustics chambers (called acoustic compliances) are the equivalent of electric capacitors. Chambers store energy in the form of pressure, and the "discharge" with air volume velocity. The value of acoustic compliance depends on chamber volume. If you check the electro-mechanic-acoustic circuit of a speaker, it is a circuit with electric, mechanic and acoustics components, the chamber compliance is connected in series with the "mechanical compliance" of the suspension, where the compliance is the mechanical equivalent of capacitors. So these two "capacitors" (mechanic and acoustic) being connected in series, the total "capacitance" is reduced, thus requiring more force for getting displacement. The total RLC mechanical circuit of the cone and suspension is altered. In fact the resonant frequency of the cone rises because of the smaller compliance, Sorry for making it long, the line is: Chambers DO NOT correct the impedance mismatch of the cone and air, that is made with the equivalent of transformers in acoustic circuits, the horns.
I just noticed that Medhi moved his hand 2 cover his mouth every time he “swore”
Using multiple vibrators, eh? I mean multivibrators.
If you remove the resonance chamber from guitar will the strings vibrate for longer? 🤔
5:36 *mehdicine bottle.
I wish I could learn something from these amazing videos but I just keep forgetting what I see. It's just fun. sorry Mehdi, keep up the good work, I'll keep up learn something. greetings from Iran.
he actually put bleep in the title
Beep beep BBB beep beep
If only fucking was that easy...
see 2:59
why didn't you just use the beeping device
8:51  Voltage: *goes on fire* Mehdi: *OH $H!T!!!*
Personally I'm not a fan of the bleep sound. It's irritating. Much better and funnier is, when other sounds are used. Like that of animals. Quacking from a duck for example.
the part where he sings its impressive like no voice cracks
7:28 how you turn up the amplitude, by changing the V/div on the Osci? :D
DRUG BOTTLE
High notes=highkey
Your making a fucking button he said
wow, this guy basically made and tuned a headphone for 1khz, I learned more about how headphones are tuned
I love how the fire starts right when he turns the other way
That's the best transition to sponsors.
doesn't everyone need a beeping button if they swear, you could consider to make a lot of them and sell
you made a 4th order enclosure  with your hands
High five to everyone taking the electromagnetic forces section of college/ap/university physics. Shall we cry together and patch our drained souls with Electroboom content?
3:13 Thats a Bowling Ball
genius !
Comment
Sounds like a overcomplicated Morse code
1:09 star trek lower decks moment
Why not using a wienn bridge?
Did this man actually stub his toe for a joke. The dedication
i hate ****, when used in context everyone knows what you just said. Even when people speak those words out loud, the youtube subtitles are **** it. Which is ridiculous. I prefer to write every word out in its full glory. I think they do it for not getting flagged or whatever, a valid reason when it's your income, but i still find it ridiculous and childish.
This guy is overqualified for youtube
I just realized he covers his mouth with his hands whenever he "swears".  Absolutely brilliant
I was impressed with his vocal control. That was unexpected.
Tinnitus warning needed on this. Not sure if he’s still beeping or if it’s my ears now lolol
XDDD
( :
8:49 WTF Did he spill gasoline or something on the handkerchief?
What 3d printer dose he have?
His ability to wave his hand in front of his mouth everytime is on point lol truly a skilled man
This is what happens when an electrical engineer builds something - a fancy circuit held together with hot glue and insulation tape.
Wow Medhi, I never knew you had such a beautiful singing voice!
He’s the best!  I’m serious :)
can be improved though, it's kind of out of tune (1khz beep is B but electroboom's beeping button makes a C)
but WHY?
8:50 laughed so hard XD
lmao, the breadboard is burned.
My wife just said:  "Is he encouraging you to keep junk?"
I've watched this video on my iphone se. And now I don't use iphone anymore, Generally me I like it and I want to use it but in public, I don't want to then because the people that don't use iphone and their parents tell them pay attention in class and bring your grades up first, they will get jealous of me and want to hate on me. But hey, I know what to do  Shake it off https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nfWlot6h_JM That's my favorite song. Thanks A LOT taylor swift. Now the song's stuck in my head.
Well its not like the *ahem*  Elgato Stream deck *cough*  Exists. 🤫
DRUG boottel XD
2:58  I know that a few of you are trying to find this moment
why dont make it just say FUCK why beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
1,401 videos had the privilege to get a like from me
those notes tho
It's "bleep" guys....
I like beep
wonderful opera performence
Nyan...
painnnnn
What a voice,.. Congrats! 😁 You missed your career.
It's not a mistake it's a masterpiece
0:01 you can see everytime he says "*1000Hz sine wave*" he puts his hand to cover his mouth. genius.
Good morning I was thinking that the message is ready and waiting on
lo primero que pensé fue en un ingeniero botón y no entendía
I expected a button that when you pushed it, it would make you say S&!T!
4:00 its sounds like a chimp sing with a chicken.. IT IS BEAUTIFUL 😍
you should have built the resonator cavity with just a pipe with a length for 1kHz, much easier.
Mehdi you are in wrong profession
https://youtu.be/X81AoBcVnaA
Bro why not use a *1khz note*ing 555
Mehdi maybe you should consider signing professionaly
Nice
We need 2 of those buttons strapped to Joe BIdens feet. So every step he makes............
Dear Mehdi. Fun part when you partially fail to explain the speaker cabinet and resonance😘. I still don't always see when you use irony and when you just don't care for accuracy for entertaining reasons😅. I imagine people build portable bluetooth speakers with this method and give up their fascination for DIY dute to ultimate frustration.😂 LOL
Thanks for the cricique of cancelation culture
👏🤣 4:10 wow that's awesome
Make the button shock you so when you press it you have no choice but to cuss.
4:29 F uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu ****************************************************************************************************************
I have to say this **** video made me laugh my **** **** **** off.  You are one of the most **** creative **** **** on the **** **** of **** platform... **** **** genius.
To be honest I just want you to get use out of that 3D printer. They can do very cool things.
THIS DAY: "TODAY i like to make a @#&*ING button" FOR 2024: "TODAY i like to make a @#&*ing switch" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
love your channel lol i have a question i have a harmon cardon reciever that needs fixing. i brought it in to have it fixed and still has a humming sound in each channel and all the inputs do the same. he charged me 300 fn dollars and still the same shit. i was wondering if i sent it to you you can have a look at it and have you fix the problem. thank you.
"its not what said, whats implied? read between the                   lines"
Is he saying bleeping?
I loved how Mehdi covered his mouth with his hand every time he bleeped himself so you can't read his lips
8:43 8:50 9:03
First time in my whole life when I see oscilloscope inside 3D printer.
i learn more in these 15 min videos than in my school in 1 month
Has a 3d printer behind him: Massacres a pill bottle with a drill anyway
Best testing at end
Well if you are not electrical engineer you could use a buzzer 9v battery and on/off switch with a very simple connection
8:55 he really wanted to use the bleeping button
In Mexico that "SHAVE-AND-A-HAIRCUT, TWO BITS"  tone at the end means "go bleep your mother."
@2:13 WE ARE NOT HERE TO DO SOFTWARE!!!!!!! me with a computer science degree D:
Mehdi-cine bottle 😂
Did anybody notice in the that whenever he is beeping, his mouth will be blocked by his hand
Beep
Covered your mouth while saying beep words!👍🤣😂
How do you not know how to program an arduino? You’re an Electrical Engineer?
Literally no one: Electroboom out of context: 0:00 also 2:56
Brilliant! Thank you!
"You learned a ton from it"  ...Did I?
&#!$%ing = Honking
When you do a longer bleep at 10:31, the frequency of the bleep seems to briefly rise. What's up with that?
holy *$&
holy fuk
oh fuck no its A FUCKING BUTTON
don't use bad words
He literally Built a synthesizer. I learn so much here.
OMG wtf?????? that was awosme idea mehdi holy Sh"Beeeppp"
facking button
This was 5 months ago?
10:21 😂😂😂😂
You claim to be an electrical engineer but have solid knowledge in basic electronics,maybe the course structure was different in your college.
It’s a bit out of tune
the singing is the most underrated part of the video
its just a 1000Hz tone
8:50  Ok getting my sco- *fire*
Thank you for that :) God bless you.
Lol
Local firetruck use's the same note 10:40
4:00 WTF that sounds pretty good!
10:22 bleeeeeep
You can sing wow
this a funny part 2:58
Episode on fire suppression systems perhaps?
That queen of the night was.... Impressive....
Nice sound 10:40 🗿😂
At 6:50 he goes Canadian
is this for kids
The fucking button?
your getting old your hair is white
3:59 electro boom opera btw it was great opera
ooooo. hearing the magic flute, aria of the queen of the night....in a electroboom video was.....suprising XD if anyone told me about that, i'd thought he made the sound with an tesla coil, but him actually singing it? damn^^ thumbs up^^
The toe-stubbing skit was painful to watch, you really slammed it
The only person who can make "angry screaming"-comedy actually funny
Caught you doin drugs in 4k
99% bleep 1% electroboom
Anybody else notice that the final buttons frequency is a bit above 1 kHz? It's more towards the spectrum of 1.05.
It would have been nice if you spent a little more time on the actual circuit
That face when he enacted stubbing his toe was priceless
ITS F@#$ING KOOL
blur is more expensive than hand to mouth
you are so &#!$%ing intelligent.
we know we've had good social progress when science channels are dropping sick cancel culture bars, and not even in a shitty condescending way. love it
4:14 it’s horrible I imagined Mehdi being a monkey whilst he demonstrated the acoustic chamber
2:59 IKEA garbages could not stand after the kick, EXPOSED FOR FAKING CLIPS..
He is a idiot in a good way
Can u make slapping sound machine?  As 11:24
Imagine if Mehdi puts a second foot switch to this and becomes Dave Lombardo 😂😂
So where's the big red button from the thumbnail?
hahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa hohohohohohohiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiih haohihu
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
The subtilty of how you cover your mouth perfectly every time you say beep is pretty impressive haha
4:03 **me in the shower**
Plot twist : &#!$%ing means Bleeping it has 5 words before "ing" and  fu#$ has 4.
Thanks!
Nice singing👍👍👍👍👍👍😃😃
You are too old for doing these things, especially your Opera. Stop it now! May god bless you.
As a musician, I found your explanation of resonance chamber to be the most bizzaire and weird I have ever heard :D.  You also surprised me saying that it has to be in front of the speaker. Pretty much every application I can think of has the resonance chamber behind the source of sound, not in front of it. I mean, speaker columns for example have cavity inside, which acts as a resonance chamber, while the speakers are on the outside. Piano has a resonance chamber below the strings, while the opening is over them, same with violin, guitar and many more instruments.  BTW, a great example of how powerful resonance chamber can be is if you have one of those little instruments used inside music box. Take it out and you can barely hear any sound. Put it on a piano (or even some regular furniture) and suddenly it gets very loud.
beep booton is great
He is the best singer ever.
5:37 Mehdi-cine bottle
4:01. just, 4:01.
4:45 - That's what she said
it seems to me that he does it on purpose
I think i know what he was cursing about most of the time....mostly:shit and fuck
Can you PLEASE explain this???  https://youtu.be/mLTI1knvqy4
ElectroBOOM, can you make a DIY digital Keyboard/synthesizer using the contraption you used in this video?
The fucking bitton
2:59 that sounded like a machine gun firing wtf
This guy has officially made me wish I studied electrical engineering in college. 😅
I love the hexagons
8:48 😂😂😂
... he can use this for Morse code
A f****** button
I tend to curse. A lot. I'll take two of these!
buttan
You can make one for gordon ramsay 👍🏻
You know you paid attention in class when you understand what he's talking about.
One gets so FUCKING tired of all those beeps. If you dont want certain words, just dont sayem...
The world needs 10:21 as a short video, and also as an alarm tune.
Fucking button
Out of the entire video my favourite part is when he stopped his toe how would you even spell that noise that he made something like eeeeeeeeahhhhhhhh
6:27  we need more holes👀
You should sell that foot activated swear button, sir.
4:00
4:00 me at 2am for no reason
Or move to Sweden! We can say whatever we want on TV and it won't be bleeped. We can swear on TV without any problem
I just have to say: I really enjoy watching your videos for not only the content and information and how well you explain everything but also for your hilarious and goofy sense of humor.Like for example, in this video I really enjoyed you having multiple pairs of your hands on screen pointing things out at the same time and then picking up the board and rubbing your hands and picking at your scar. Absolutely genius always enjoyable to watch please keep it coming.
Yes. Software is for hunky philipino boys.
بزن لایکو
5:18 Why does I see this as a crypto graph lol.
Never thought of speaker cabinets as impedance matching before, that's a great insight!
09:45 u give me an idea to play codm
Him:*swears alot* Me:man what does f%$#ing button even mean😭🤣
Didn't know that Bruce Banner have educational YouTube channel
Why you making a fucken button beep
Just found your channel and am surprised that you survived for this long
Me when I need to take a math test 8:06
10:19 Trying the Button!
4:04 he sounds like a rubber duckie
8:50 Boy, am I glad to not have Mehdi as tennant or neighbour :D. I would be constantly worrying about still having a house / home the next day. No, seriously, that was frickin' dangerous, with easily flammable material all around, and could have easily spiralled out of control.
f@$% button
I will become a Patron for life if we can get "Electroboom Does The Marriage of Figaro"
10:22 to 10:38 the most funniest moment🤣🤣🤣🤣
this man is very smooth with his sponsorship things... just like someone that grew a beard last year
Of all the things I expected to hear in this video, an electrical engineer singing that one aria from the Magic Flute was least among them.
*stubs toe* Nyehhhhhhh
wait- you dont knwo how to program arduino???
Fuckin button 🔘 26 Times thanks me later 😅🤭
Hi
Now I can finally speak Q*Bert
I’m so happy I found your channel haha
The background looks nice bro!
4:15 Alternative title: handsome iranian man orchestra
imagine programming an ariduno just for a fucking beep. there are shits out there who are doing that actually. but 8:50 what? how even this shit takes fire?
JUST ADD A DIODE IN THE BEGANNING FOR REVERSE POLARITY PROTECTION
_P A G L A_
2:54
Electroboom should be a singer
He made a fu***** button.... can he make a fu** button?
We really don't want to hear the beep every 0.001 sec, I'm sure you'll gain more subs if u stop censoring
4:11 great rendition!
It's confirmed. Medhi is an eldritch abomination with 2 pairs of arms.
“Sometimes people prefer ****ing than not ****ing” That sounds weird out of context “Sometimes in the heat of passion, you just want to do it but if your quick enough you can stop yourself” Oh no, this is taking a drastic turn
#&*
why do you have same background as 8 bit guy
He is a good singer
1:23 fun fact: I once got banned from a forum permanently for swearing. The offensive post contained: %#*%#$! (Or similar)
https://youtu.be/4l8wCMM6-yw That's a little weird.
Mommy can we have Elon Musk? No we have Elon Musk at home Elon Musk at home:
8:43
Actually us programmers do have to learn electronics in physics if we are enrolled in a degree program
Please make a plasma candle
Mehdi dont age restrict your Videos please! I cant watch them!!
that's like this meme: why is it "camouflage" and not           ?
حداقل زیر نویس فارسیتو بزار
چرا به زیان فترسی ویدیو نمیزاری وقتی که بلدی
by far one of the best sponsor plugs ive ever seen
🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
hahahaaaahaaaaaaaaa
So many Censored words ayayyayaya
🇮🇷🇮🇶🇮🇷🇮🇶🇮🇷🇮🇶
نه ما فهم شتحجي بس حبنك 😘😔
The best thing about this channel is not electronic but humor.
can you try to generate electricity with a motor please
The end product doesn't sound like 1kHz.
what is it good for?   ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!
Really love your videos, just make sure not to hurt yourself.
i never have laughed this loud in my whole history of life XD: 8:42
10:37 new emote?
I learnt more from his 1w min video than what I learnt from 2hs of science
Can you tell us more about the circuit so we can make this?
Hand gestures plus $&*#@ button equals an effective way to share your thoughts
A
Mehdi help meeee!!!!!! My soldering iron broke. HELLPPPP MEEE
Censor button 🤭
That new singing ist perfekt for adding in the Electroboom Ringtone :3
Finally some "educational" content ( Reeves will be mad :)  Luv u both!
Censorship is bullshit and ruins everything it touches.
Bleeping amazing
Awesome 😀💔🤣🤣🤣
Rip my headset
2:59 I cant 😂🤣😂
That really reminds me of the Count https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AXPnH0C9UA Please, just keep making your videos!
I love your *********ING vidios. I meant Interesting videos
And still hurt yourself today in this video. I guess you never learn about safety. :-) Some errors can easy avoided. :)
24K gold plated banana award
8:50 I was waiting for this 🤣🔥🔥
lunatic electir boom!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Electrocute's piano music is also improving....
Dang, you can sing the magic flute opera
Wow when I was done watching the video, it was midnight.
A beewping button!
There is no video without BOOM
Mehdi the computer parts contain  gold? A lot of people made videos that they are extracting gold from computer parts is that real.
if you would use this button on my watch i would think f to the uck
Make and inproved heating for you buttocs
This is Zucker brothers level of comedy. I love you ! 😘
I still wonder of how is he aliveafter somany shocks
People: no one can be funny and genius in the same time Electroboom: hold the camera 🎥
Instant swearing electroboom
My friends dreams: I had a dream I kissed my crush My dreams: 4:02
Watch Paul McWhorter's newest Arduino series. That would be a great place to start learning Arduino if you want. He assumes you know nothing about programming or electronics.
10:36 i  am  you *BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP*
ElectroBOOM:You can do Programming but not electricity Me:You can do command block but not redstone
Those singing lessons from SkillShare be paying dividends, eh Mehdi?
سلام
Wasn’t easier using a sine wave oscillator like wien bridge
Now use Morse code with it
Our Queen of the Boomnight!
Love from India ❤️ sir
It was only a matter of time before Medhi started basing videos on jokes from the IT Crowd
Midroll ads randomly placed!
Damn he made the part where he stubs his toe look pretty good
Yes finally a f**k buttom
Just get an fpga thats not running software it runns Hardware XD
You should have epic voice guy and Deadpool featured in this 😂
Why.....why I wear headset in this video
Great video.  I did learn!
now i want to make one on my own , can u give bit of details (?) ty!! i need it for bike horn , :D
I was hoping he was saying boolean when it was censoring his words
He covered his mouth everytime he “sweared” until the “I just said bleep” joke…
I thought it was a shitting button at first like~ if your constipated you can just press the shit button .. no?
It's been 9 years and Mehdi still doesn't use rubber gloves
wait a minute that thing can also be used for morse code
foolin button
Your testing sound of"Blblblblb!".. I have to make that my ringtone LOL!!
He 24hours just talk ******
2:13 I feel attacked.
Bleep
"We should be fine"
He's covering his mouth Everytime he's saying *************?!+$+$+-$
I am from Bangladesh  & I like too much the ElectroBOOM
The irony of bleeping curse words on TV and in videos, in general, is that we all know the words. And so when we hear the bleep, we already know what the word is, so it isn't like they are hiding anything. And if a child grows up with parents who already have potty mouths, than the bleeping is completely pointless; *mostly
Or you can just get voice mod because it has a Bleep button made into the software and you can play your own soundboard and change your voice with the voice mods they have in it
Pro tip: do not go to the pharmacy asking about your 'bottle of drugs'.
I missed the sparks and the flames and the it hapened YEAH !!!!
8:48 Karma.
Comedy genius!
I love it when as soon as he says *bleep he puts his hand in front of his mouth. 😂
I think my channel is good
9:32 Holdup where’d you get all those hands
5:36 "I should have called it a medicine bottle" No not, if it was medicine the problem you have would go away for ever, but most "medicine" you get from your doctor do not cure your illness, and needs to be taken years or forever.  And that pain "medicine" is the biggest problem in many country's, that makes many people drugs addicts.
8:51 fire
hand *band   quick recovery my man
What was that sound at 5:16 😂
5:15 lag?
now he can do morse code too
This man censors the curse words at the right moment.
say the truth what you were thinking in the  first beeping conversation scene
Music guy here, yes it's called an acoustic chamber, or a acoustic pressure amplifier, or a acoustic resonator
😂 thanks for making my day awesome ❤️
Thank god theres no failure in this video
watching your videos has given me keysight advertisements.
normaly its soft to hard
4;10 is that true🤣
He made a fucking button. A plain button
We watched that documentary in physics class
Cool circuit. A Wien bridge oscillator would be more accurate :P
I didn't learn ****!
4:00 When my parents told me to sing that song in Adventure Time
I'm in again 😜
You should make a speaker that plays music, like if you want him to do it too!
so you just made a 4th order bandpass for the little driver...... and we dont push the resonate frequency out side of the audible range when designing a speaker typically it is used to get more low end extension 4th order bandpasses are known for their one note peak at a given tuning different from what we normally would use such as a simple ported or sealed enclosure.
If only we all had some old unused spare speaker’s to do something with

I love the &#!$%ing big brain idea of using your hand to cover your mouth before the reveal.
I can finally learn something. Keep it up!
8:31-8:35😂😂😂😂😂
He should make a channel where he does red stone engineering
I want to ask if you could show if 110V AC can be drawn from a 12V DC to 220V AC power converter by tapping one hot leg and the ground leg? Will this damage the power converter?  Thank you kindly,  Love your videos!
I like the background
10:40 Why does this sound familiar to a very specific website with a black and orange design?
bro you lot of swearing
I really don't understand  the shit your talking about but still I love you videos 🖤 Big fan from india,dude.......
Holy Bleep on a bleeping sandwich
69k likes just paired with the title😂
This idea is brilliant

Can we take a moment to appreciate mehdi’s impossibly perfect comedic timing?
Queen of the night aria
buzzer + button + battery i think it much easier.
10:21 ElectroBOOM story
Im learning and laughing
Have you tried playing jewsharp?
I have a question for you. I'm studying to become an electrical engineer, but the question, could we use a vertical hydroelectric motor with a electric converter to essentially have "unlimited energy on a global scale"?
Ни хуя не понял, но очень интересно)))
تو هم که فقظ به چخ سگ میری😂😂😂
bro u r indian
I can't believe you don't know Arduino. That said, it's probably too easy compared to what you do know how to do. thanks for sharing, love the content
چرا کل ویدئوت بوقه😐😑😐😂
Isn't the frequency at 9:13 and afterwards higher than what it was before?? Before it was a little flatter than B and now it is slightly sharper than C.
This channel makes so much more sense at 0.25x speed

Hi ElectroBoom, I just did a drawing about you, check it out 😉
Ur making a f***ing button 😐😂😂😂😂
10:36 he got me there.
Can't wait to see him get shocked and press/step the button
Hello, I'm from Bangladesh. I love your every video. just wow 😍😍
9:10 Where's the build finish music?
3:58  You have a beautiful cough but you should see a Dr. about that nasty singing!! I hope it's nothing serious!!
Can you sell that ?
Hes still alive, (after six years of electricution)
I know youre Iranian 🤣
Hello,  Just one thing, what the ElectroBOOM youtuber is doing is really dangerous. Don't try that at home otherwise you have really much risk of major injuries even death since the body die at 230+ V depending of your health. So respect some people who work on electric or like that for long time like him. BUT do NOT participate on challenges like getting on 10 seconds on HIGH voltage. It's deadly. Thanks for who saw my comment, having a nice day. :-)
I will slap the beep out of u lol
8:48 my favorite part
I like how when it’s bleeped out in the beginning he also covers his mouth at the same time. Really amps up the suspense
10:40 *why does this sound so familiar*
is this true ?
https://youtu.be/1tfvtJyucHc
2:59 that thing hurts more than a breakup
I have a little challenge for you: design a resistance touch switch that triggers a microcontroller. It's more difficult than it seems, because your finger often acts as a floating input, triggering the microcontroller multiple times a second, rather than acting as a true conductor between both terminals of the switch.
Аппарат слух
Do you have 4 hands?
We've actually never heard electroboom swear before
I love you, man.
Hey you're a joke.
I made this &€&@#%ing button in your video… at least the sine wave out of a lm358 but im proud.
I like how he beep everytime when his censuring his mouth 0:10
Where do you buy your electronic parts? I want to do my own "experiments" at homr but don't know where to order parts.

Please make a video on this, is it fake or real? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8Y7L2eT8WE
You could probably map a button on your keyboard to send a bleep noise into your video chat or recording software. Just in case you wanted to try and create some kind of software solution, you wouldn't need a whole arduino. You could maybe even use a computer mouse.
They think the sound is racist🤦‍♂️
4:02 that was unexpetedly plesent!!!... 😀
THIS IS THE BEST CHANNEL ON YOUTUBE. No, seriously, so much serious teaching and so much fun all in one! Binge watching for 2 days straight... I am eternally grateful to Technology Connections for dropping the name! The algorithm never showed me one video of Mehdi's ever before :(
Yes, Mom I Need This For Meetings To Not Get Expelled From School
Yo Mr electroboom, I just had a thought that I thought would it good for a future project, can you make a laser alarm system? I've seen a lot of videos about this but none of them seem legit I've always wanted to make one but I could never find a good video for it, please take this into consideration. Thank you for your time reading this if you are, your loyal viewer, the one and only true magician, MagicMan.

8:49 Electroboom: Ok, cleaned up,(turns around)… Paper towel: it is kinda cold in this room Circuit: oh let me help you!
Mehdi singing opera is lowkey one of the best things I've seen!
8:43-8:51
Just got all those resonance questions wrong on my 2nd year test. Kill me
I often watch your videos Love from Pakistan❤️❤️
Mehdi, what's the biggest fuse ( in terms of amperage) that you can pop with your previous projects or something that you can build with components you have at home ?
At this point i am checking regulary on him to make sure he is alive
Medhi:"I STILL DON"T KNOW HOW TO CODE"      Some guy:"oh reALLY WHY DON'T YOU TRY BLOCK CODING"    Everyone else: "Medhi is such a baby at coding he doesn't even know how to block code." (block coding is the easiest)   Medhi replies:"I do harder coding than this"  Everyone else:"oh reALLY!!!"
I like to see electroboom suffering in pain
Actually quite interesting! I'm going to have to build one of these.
BOOM HERE COMES THE BOOM
He should get an electrician licence
"It sounds weak like when you stub your toe."  *Insert Balkan swearing at 80 dB*
My physics teacher made the same thing with a "medicine bottle"
TRY EVERTECH SANDBOX A SUPER GAME
Hey mehdi please explain us the Capacitive Dropper Circuit and how we can get a DC voltage from AC without isolation and Switched converters.
oh yes!
Lol
sToP sAymf
If this guy dies, The whole Subscribers is on Depressed Mode.
photonic is back https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUq0NVO0Q2M
On today's episode of "Unnecessary Censorship"...
How do buy this?
I still think that this is one of the few channels that I actually see the full sponsored section.
hahahahha the toe face is superb
Sounds like a telegraph.
2:56 and 5:16
Video 1 of asking you: Why does your head look like an egg?
a button to go with all the mistakes made making "gates".
Do you know of Photoinduction Mr Electroboom?  Some crazy English guy that does very very incredible things with electricity.  The latest one he does is popping a 5000amp fuse.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mGhhdPgXG8
Can I run my home on DC after converting 220v Grid single phase? Is this an efficient idea?
Electroboom plz do this  Can you make a video on 'Can we gain INFINITE POWER by Vacuum' In which you should try to create a complete vacuum in a transparent container and try to power a windmill kinda thing inside it.....And once the windmill thing is powered, it should go on for a long time as it is a vacuum. And the energy released by the rotations of the mill should be converted into electrical energy. So by this I want to see that my idea works or not.. BTW  LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!
damn
3:45 You got to love Mehdi sing even though an easier example would have been 2 different bottles <3
Now taht is what I call a new way of not getting demonitized
Thats why favorite opera music which was composed by mozart😍
https://youtu.be/fKjutkiR7Rc  Love u man. I worship the unibrow n FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER. Can u Do this pls. And whats the amp on that thing
finally i can say ****
You can also use it as a handy morse code tool.
ElectroBOOM, I was hoping you can answer a question I have; at my place of work they always tell people including myself that whenever we do hook-ups for emergency purposes (i.e. casualty power) to always hook up from load to source, instead of the other way around. Can you please explain that, I never really made any sense out of it.
BEGONE *beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep*
Eletroboom💥 I was wondering if I can put your logo I'm my huge RC helicopter It is 6 feet long and 2.5 feet tall and because of you I have the knowledge to make one
the solution to everything electric related *blow on it until it goes out*
when you feel passionate made me question what this button dose
I need to press the f****** button
wow mehdi made a morse code machene by accident
your content is as always  Rude, Reactive , and Real !
Start the video by assuming bleep sound is Fu&@ing button
10:20 pure gold!
Background is impressive
That CuriosityStream advertisement in the video is the only advert worth watching thanks to Mehdi Sadaghdar's personality. 😂😉
i can't tell if the skin burn sounds are edited in or actually real, they sound so loud
Ok Boomer If you have question with quality post it on your sub reddit no matter you entity I may or may not Check it in the next episode of LATITY
I'd buy tickets to hear Mehii singing.
THE LITTLE BABY REEEEEE IS SO FUNNY MAN
9:24 I know some of those letters and numbers
I did NOT expect the whole board to light up on fire
2:58  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 im dead man
Anyone remembers Latity? One episode, Mehdi said he'd make a safety free induction heater at 200k likes, that goal has been reached!   Edit : The doomsday device has already been made, I did not catch that
In my country we saying, "vigyázzá bazdmeg mer megbasz az áram" and it's make perfect sens. 😐
Are u Iranian?
I think he should change his channel name from electro boom to electro pain
&#!$%ing funny
Fuck that..... lol good vid
dude still alive wtf.
Please, permit me to ask a simple question? How many programmers use assembly language or machine code directly? This is what counts as interacting directly with hardware, otherwise, it is using a High Level Programming Language whose primary purpose is to isolate the programmer from the machine's complexity by providing a more human-readable code structure.
I can hear fire whenever Mehdi goes anger
8:50 lmao
Past Medhi: Check out the article below for the diagram Now Medhi: Here are the components (in video)
Can you try to make a oscillograph out of sand or water or something else. something that vibrates and shows a picture. If its even possible
Thanks Mehdi, I would have neded this when this morning I discovered that there is a trend of people grounding their shoes to be "connected to earth" in a spiritual way and to dissipate EMF... &#!$%
4:46 so hole size DOES matter...
Twerking
10:25, covering your mouth like that during the beeps is genius.
Mehdi! Make some wall speakers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGzNkUmPdXc
The only Accused is The truth
Photonicinduction is back Booom!!!!!
11:23 Ruko
a WORKing button
Thanks! Your video make me smile Every day.
Big F**k for your advertising
Is it weird if im watching him to learn something instead of watching it for fun?
Electroboom Sir I was inspired by your capacitor making process. Following that I also made capacitor of 132nF. I would be grateful to you if you know how can I share my model.
please Try dont sensor you toxic 🔥
also send this to soviet womble, the "you cant say that" bell does stuff all
my gpu has probe points for certain voltages, however it doesnt label what pins are for what and what ground is for what pin. as far as i know there are 2 major load circuits, gpu core and vram. how can i safely probe these points to get a good vcore read? im basically an idiot version of electroboom (yesterday i ran a gpu on car battery for the lols, 12v dc is 12v dc amirite?)
mehdi use a solder to make holes in bottles
Make it but with a giant speaker
Up-voted for being a man of culture! "The Magic Flute"; Papageno!
the starting feels like he's making some kind of double entrende jokes....Lmao
How the heck did you hit them notes, well done sir
Electroboom:Have fun while learning
With his new wall Mehdi is starting to look like a real tech youtuber.
@ElectroBOOM i want a 12v dc to 65-0-65 convertor can you make it
@electroBOOM i need a 12v dc to 65-0-65 convertor for an amplifier board can you do that
The asymmetry of your background wall "cubes" is displeasing.
Lowkey really impressive how Mehdi made sure his hands blocked line of sight to his mouth for every F-bomb as if it were natural.
I dont really get how this circuit functions. How are you getting a sawtooth waveform from the schmitt trigger without having a full on integrator circuit? Is it R4 and C1 that achieve this?
أثبتوا وجودكم يا عرب 😆 اللي جايين من مشعفل 🥴
You know what, I love that you used Die Zauberflaute as the classical piece to do at 4:14. It's one of my favourite operatic pieces.
my favourite part of the video is the fire sound effect
Tested circuit and failed at 12V. Re-tested the breadboard at 17V and breadboard caught on fire. Nice 👍
have any video about wiring engine car? if not, what king wire i can use to wire a engine car?
I think we should apreceate how smooth the transitions to the sponsor always are
5:15 😂
Thanks for such an amazing video.
Plot twist: he's covering his lips, because he is NOT saying "BLEEP" in the beginning. 😱
are you persian???
hi , as always super video :D :D , i have this same power supply , this current problem can be solved by resetting counting unit. button for this is in inside on the board behind the display
🙏sir, please please please please please please please please, sir make a video on ups transformer with the type that the output should have 3 wires
Why did the algorithm hide this from my subscription feed?
Welp im agree, the censor button is better than toxic people
plz make video on how to convert 220v ac to 220v dc
*” I am you...”*     BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-
electrobeep
Today youtube demonatizes electroboom because their Ai picked up the beeps
What is ElectroBoom video without him getting shocked or catch something on fire 😂
This madman actually stubbed his toe for the footage 👀
Came for the humor and education. Stayed for the amazing opera performance
Where can I get the files to 3D print an oscilloscope?
Next you should make a synthesiser
Great video! Love the new backdrop
YouTube: *You poopyhead*
sponsor god
I signed up for curiosity stream after hearing many YouTubers shill for it,  and unsubbed before the first month finished. The video constantly get stuck buffering, which was incredibly annoying. Beyond that, while the documentaries tend to have high production value, they are often lacking in substance. There are some decent docs, but the majority are sub-standard and try to make up for it with flashy editing and charismatic presentation. You can find better docs for free on YouTube. I'm honestly a bit sick of YouTubers shilling for this site. It's not that good. They should take some of their advertising budget and figure out how to fix the damn buffering issue before trying to bring more traffic. I had this experience only a couple of months ago, FYI, so they still haven't got their sh!t together.
time for a next hair dying day dude... ;) grayscaletechnicaly... ;)
4:00 thank me later
Mehdi brings grounding your children to a whole new level
I was watching your taser video, in which you said, you would not touch a taser with a 100 mile pole, so I started to wonder if, voltage dessipates over a metal, if the length of the metal pole increases?
Poes
You sr are a genius 😂😂
You look like Gargamel
mehdi has created a morse code device
Morse code
5:35 the "Mehdison" bottle. Perfect.
4:10 no u did not just...
Hi Mehdi im mostafa from iran , Good Job Man :) Can you make a video about full bridge inverters and explain how its work and how can we choose parts like mosfets , actually i want to use arduino for running an inverter and its like a huge monster for me :)
your face when your singing is going to my friday night funkin mod
My 5 year kid also enjoyed this video with me . And he 8s keep '' hi hi hi 😊 ha hah hi haaa. . .only video of my choice which is 'we' enjoyed.
What a *BEEEEEEEEEEEEEPP* great video
ایرانی نیست این؟
You know if something is wrong when you still hear "bleeep" after the video is done
دکور جدید مبارک
nice look💖💖🌹
Mehdi could swear in Persian, problem solved
Mehdi is basically an older Micheal Reeves
Loved the project and the purpose behind it.
well, at least you can use the bleeper if youtube demonetizes this
It says A high current flowing through a battery can cause a rapid increase of temperature, potentially resulting in an explosion with the release of hydrogen gas and electrolyte (an acid or a base), which can burn tissue and cause blindness or even death.
Next time, he'll be collaborating with DankPods.
you should have a 3d printer 🖨️
Skip the Arduino, choose raspberry pi
At 2:59 I laughed so hard I snorted. Then I laughed because I snorted.
I dont understand what hes saying but damn is it entertaining
you can see him cover up is mouth every time he cusses so u can’t see that he’s actually not even cussing. genius 😭
The Op Amp in this video is TLV4112 (too many 1s)
I wanted to subtitle your videos so my father can watch it with me. Please enable subtitle contribution so i can translate it to &#!$%ing portuguese! lmao
That toe stub is the funniest thing I've seen in a while
New room?
Hi, can we reduce our phones static electricity at it's  metal case while it's charging? While talking to my friend with headphones on the phone, a sizzling sound occurs when I plug the phone into the charger. But if i touch to my phone sizzling reduces. 🤔 There must be a solution like adding grounding things into the charger idk
Oh wow, the acoustic panels in the background look sick!
Wonderfull great Video
someone clip mehdi opera
Why no use a single 555?
8:32 thats a little sussie
I sadly miss the Crazy Scientist Lab.. ;(
can you make a big antenna in the next video?
Fantastic job on the magic flute!
- Is against censorship - Comes from an authoritarian country, knowing how power can corrupt. - Hints at the thought of thought crime. - Acknowledged cancel culture Based & Red pilled.  Welcome brother. *hugs*
Upvoted just for that Magic Flute solo. Pretty sure I'm younger than you and I got nowhere near that range.
how to waste your money and harm your body
I don't know I still think that splicing a 1khz sine wave into the main audio track in adobe premiere is easier.
Bad word fun
Hmmm... not bad
Imagine him and Michael reeves collab
The first circut exploded, the second one burned to death and on the last one he burned himself. As it is tradition.
مثل دکمه سیک***😢
Could you recommend Any alternate opamp ??? Or datasheet of the one you used
Hay man you are getting old it's time you make or buy a welding machine your life will change if you do
How is he not dead
make a small FUSION reactor.... make a small FUSION reactor.... make a small FUSION reactor.... make a small FUSION reactor.... make a small FUSION reactor.... make a small FUSION reactor.... make a small FUSION reactor.... make a small FUSION reactor.... make a small FUSION reactor.... make a small FUSION reactor.... make a small FUSION reactor.... make a small FUSION reactor.... make a small FUSION reactor....

سلام از ایران
We need electroboom and micheal reeves collab!!!!
I still feel that the prof who made electronics boring for me is a criminal!!!
9:43 another two hands of whom🤔
4:00 man your sound is better than the team who actually done it
I watched all your vedios 😘
8:43 INSTANT REPLAY
8:33 INSTANT REPLAY
4:01 Electroboom's new intro :)
2:51 I was expecting it to blast on mehdi's face
I fear no man But that thing 2:51   It scares me
Nice organization of stuff, no more messy room for you
Jesus Christ! Is it that hard to find??? I used to cut school and hang around funky KKIS just about the time they stopped using the button on the desk under the microphone to separate news stories. "Car crash kills 567 people in desert pancake breakfast." BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP "Motorcycle crash kills no one not even the driver." BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP The news reader would press this button to make the beep. At that time it was going out of fashion and it was soon disconnected. Some disk jockies would say and do things on the other side of the widow to make the news broadcaster laugh.
😁😁😁 Pure comedy plus intrinsic electronics
Hey electro boom I dare you to make the sound breaker from dead target
thank you man, now i know how to make a bonfire
Oh hi ElectroBOOM some person used your lattity intro in turned it into a piano version
Hey Mehdi why u don't make audio amplifiers???(high power)
eletroboomer jokes
drug bottle?
You could push the function generator as high as it'll go and never hurt the speaker because the output impedance of the function generator is somewhat high, usually 50 ohms.
I thought he was gonna make a cussing button
Ha ha ha!
Once I changed my internal frequency I understood everything
Lower the pitch a bit, it kills me a little bit because it is high.
I didn't know you were a opera singer.
Hello, I'm from Brazil and I found your channel very fun, send an electrifying hello here to Brazil ✌️😁⚡
Medhi using Aria’s queen of the night is my spirit animal
holy shit you actually nailed that aria pretty nicely 😮
Dude I love you
you scare me sometimes  much love
not gonna lie, he had us inn the first half
Hey, Mehdi doesn't hurt himself in this vid.... never mind
Your new room is lit!
Mehdi, wasup.. Are you making a button for &#!$%ing 😊 or just some button 😁. I am getting some mixed signals from this and PS: I haven't watched the video yet.. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This was the day I learned that Mehdi has a wonderful singing voice
Electroboom make a video were you just blow up capacitors
Me seeing the thumbnail: "This can mean 1 of 2 things"
You make me fucking laugh every day
Haha 😂!
Speakers give acoustic vibration to both front and back. Some of them reach to each other and cancel. To prevent this cancelling they must be divided. Simplest example is mounting a speaker to a car. It is called infinite plane approximation. If speaker is mounted on a flat plane division is done and it sounds more to front and also to back. A nice box even without a matching acoustic Helmholtz frequency they sound louder. For more about speaker boxing check air ducts for bass etc. Front frequency matching box is also very effective for a single frequency as in here but not for a large frequency band as in music.  Cheers Elektriğin Üstadı :D
has anyone ever told you that you look like Gargamel
how the hell did he get sponsored by this?
yea.... I woulda used a 555.
What about using 555 for in monostable mode for delay
I like the fact that every time he cursed, he put hit hands to cover up the lips to avoid the demonitization. Smort 😉
Why did you put a oscilloscope in your 3d printer
Sir why you get the switch from your sewing machine leg switch 😄😃
So awesome  video but the Voice coming from the speaker is so annoying ,
4:44 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
9:55 pressing the same "sinusoidal" button and hearing the same sine wave while speaking about triangular and square waves could be a little confusing for some people, sir. Also where's the distortion boost for an extra curse??!
Hi mehdi, I am almost 14,should I post my project on your reddit, I mean is it toxic , or is it okay to post there?
I think you haven't seen any bussor
Electroboom you beated Bobby duke in sub count
0:45 😆
I am astonished that there was no accident... 🤣🤣🤣   damn... did he just literally burnt his table when I am typing this comment🤣🤣🤣
How many hands does Mehdi have again?
This is the moment he flip the switch; he F up. Burn Baby Burn*
Excellent!!!!
Cool thumbnail 🤣
Dude, it's time for a new breadboard when it catches fire more than once.
Idk if its only me but mehdi look so tired man :(
Electro booming make it boom
Hi, I have an unrelated question about smart switches and didn't know who else I could ask and google doesn't have any answers I could find. You being the king of electricity and all I couldn't think of anyone better to ask. I have old wiring in my home which means I have no neutral wire. Most of these smart switches require a neutral wire to power the WiFi chip while the switch is off. From my understanding since the neutral would simply be the wire returning the electricity back to the main box and is carrying the same voltage as the load or the live wire. Could I simply split the live wire and run that into the neutral?
yeah now i can use this on Morse code too....thank you mehdi
just this?
5:54 Today, electroboom will show you how to make a pipebomb
سلام  خوبی  بر ایرالنی
Electric bill reveal when?
candian problems need canadian solutions
7:12 the funniest
Mom- What did you learn from Electroboom today?   Me- *$#&+ing*
I'll put to my son the terrorific notes when him don't want to get sleep
Imagine using beep Button to send morse code
perfect for morse :D
Wow interesting
This man and mr bean are the inspiration for going on even after setbacks
Why would you make a counting button? https://youtu.be/B-Wd-Q3F8KM
Where are you from? لحجه ایرانی داری
Why spend 10 minutes writing software when you can spend six hours fuming about your electronic circuit not working.
When he talked about the sponsor I said where’s that button
You are the best!!!!
Why he add that stupid voltage devider on the amplifier stage? (U1B)
MAKE A BLEEPIN!!!  REMIX OF THAT OPERA SINGING GUYS!!!!
If he ever decides to quit being an electrical engineer, he could have an amazing career as a singer.
YouTube has stopped recommending me your videos so I thought you were dead
Cant we use a buzzer and a switch for this?
If you want to unhear the murder of Mozart, I would suggest listening to the same piece with Diana Damrau: https://youtu.be/UImPf_Ir3_E
I wish I could have watched your YouTube channel when I was in school, so I could at least use your work as a projects in my science class, but now that's too late.... But I at least learn somethings from you unlike my old science teacher🤣
Imagine : in a live session ,the battery Goes off 😾😾😾🤣🤣🤣
im just waiting for a lab accident that A:turns him into an op superhuman or B:turns him into a hiddious creture that gives him thepower to lay eggs out of his mouth and shoot reglur laser pointer out if his eyes.
3:59  I'm impressed!
5:15  6:26 6:37 7:11  i don't know how that got me laugh...
Still waiting for the drill induced ER visit... I've been doing stupid things with power tools for years and you still manage to make me nervous
now redo it with vacuum tubes, go borrow some from mr carlsons lab
imagine a world where people dont give specific sounds magic powers and censorship isn't "needed" at all lol
Nice video.  Special effects, mystery and suspense (how is he going to hurt himself with a drug bottle and a speaker??).
"I'm you"
My roof in the kitchen just caved in, and i thought the house was on fire, thank you for making my day slightly better electroboom
Later ,Can you make a tesla coil video with playing this old game music : https://youtu.be/XFUOINIAD6Q
Rdweno? I think you mean those raspberry pie (math symbol pie). I thought rdwenos (spelling) were for small servo motors.
2:59 Can we get some respect for him? He stubbed his toe for this vid
Do you know, so many people from russia, also see your canal. Sorry for my english... You are the best, bro.
How do you tune it to the desired frequency?  Could it be trimmed down to the same 1 kHz as the original reference?  I hear about a semitone difference.  Could that be a reflection of component tolerances?
It's really clever how everytime you were putting your hand in front of your mouth to hide it from the camera preventing people from lip reading when you were saying the name of the button for the first 35 seconds, so as to keep the sense of mystery about the video for your viewers, until you revealed it by saying it yourself
Mehdi, you do a beautiful aria sir ElectrOpera alt channel plz
ElectroCute's piano skills are getting good
Why is the fire funnier than the explosions?  xD  Also, I'd personally call that a saw tooth wave.
I dunno about other content creators but I always feel my videos are funnier when I bleep swears.
Very nice der holle rache 4:00
Morse code
YES! I actually learned alot from this video! THANKS! :D
Video idea:try to make a flywheel
Making a Fucking Button.
Wow, I didn't expect to ever hear you perform the Queen of the Night :D
"Today I would like to make" not so difficult you see.
this is so canadian lol
You should talk about plasma magnetic confinement in nuclear fusion
Did he really mean to stomp his toe that hard? :0 And if he didn't, was that face his real reactions? :O
Can I send you a circuit board and you fix for a video.. you can explain what everything does and what burned out? .... I have a replacement on the way...

this dude has been exposed to more ozone than anyone else in the world over his lifetime
That's an LTT quality segue
Bro I  need your help to make a Tesla coil and yes I have watched your video I want to make it with the homemade capacitor which you have shown in your video once and with self-made transformer but I want to ask weather it is safe /possible or not ?..😅

Electro boom can you make a video about your live in college
this is the one and only channel on youtube with a little bit of DIY tutorial that everything should happen as you expected,,, 🤭🤭🤭
Quarantine definitely got into his head..
I once connected a headphone to my Arduino and listened to the sound... For the next hour my ear hurt
Do the History Electronic FOR FUTURE VIDEO!
2:59 It made me laugh a lot. Also why won't you make LOL button instead.
How much did you pay in your  bill in electricity
8:50
Can you make thunders ⛈️⚡???
Make more Videos with LTT please? I like Linus being shocked.
2:23  haha
his last words would be: „ok, lets plug it in...“
Did he got demonitized or will get demonitized 😂
08:49 This is why I subscribed to this Channel . Thanks Mehdi.
2:19 my high school robotics teacher I joined in ee for her basically
How many people think this whole video was just a flimsy pretext for Mehdi to show off his singing skills.
Wow! I Found a friend of thor mama😃😃
sheeeeeeeesh Mehdi, the background be bussin
مهدی جان یه ویدیو راجب ساخت ژنراتور دست ساز هم بزار تو ایران هر روز ۶ ساعت برق کل کشور قعطه
Why not put a diode for reverse polarity protection?
Damn he sings good and precise too!
Square wave  More like swear wave
خیلی کارت خوبه
سلام
سلام
Hi ElectroBOOM. I am very interested in finding out where I can buy the fine hexagonal acoustic foam panels you have on the wall behind you?  Thx for a great channel.
now i know you cannot do write program arduino HAHAHA XD
Hi Mehdi Love That background you have came a long way. see you in the next video:
You got quite the rich guy fancy room lol
Are you indian
We need more holes -Mehdi 2021
666K VIEWS!! WHAT THE F@$% TAKE THIS VID DOWN THIS VIDEO IS THE D$!@%
Take this man to choir
After spending 4-5+ years at an engineering University you stumble upon ElectroBoom and you are like F*&k I have learned more from this chanel than I did in Uni...
Very impressive. Now make a perpetual motion engine.
Why not create that if you lift your hands on the keyboard and on the mouse, bleep will trigger, as most of us slam the keyboard as we swear?
I love that  *Burebrerrereererereeere* he does
How do you make one for Netflix?
Fuck. That scream when he bumped his toe into the table made my day🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
How to make a UPS for pc ?
the series circuit make my head spin
Wy does a led need a driver to work
Not gonna lie, I didnt expect him to hit those notes so well
Such function should be in mobile also. When you swear it should beep.
The background behind you looks pretty neat!
The Jim Al-Khalili documentaries on Curiosity Stream are really good.
Is it Just coincidence that Mehdi looks like Ed Boon? Or should I say Ed BOOM?
4:03 monkey sonata 🎵👏🏽
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂. I love electroboom
minecraft redstone
Anyone know what song the piano plays throughout the video? (Like at 8:41)
this is funny but, its lituraly my bleeping board from 2007 (mine has some adjustable resistors for changing frequencies and sound patterns)
I love you man! The multiple sets of hands at the schematic had me rolling.
he is making a &#!$%ing Button
The frequency changed once the circuit was switched to the one with the battery :( it wasn't 1000 Hz anymore
I just died laughing at 2:59😂😂😂😂😂
awsome video with knowledge able info
I was on the toilet when i started watching this video. The moment you started singing I took a huge shit. .. Thanks I guess..
please write the circuit Inverter IGBT input 24vdc output 48 vac thank you very much
I remember seeing the how not to make an electric guitar video about 6 years ago and I’ve been subscribed ever since. I love to see how far you’ve come since then. You deserve all the recognition!
Fantastic setup behind you in this video, perfect!
This guy could also be a audio engineer for sure.
There is something so validating about Mehdi not knowing or caring to know how to program arduino despite being the God of analogue electronics. Code really is a different world haha. Being like "I don't know how to code so I'll just use analogue principals to make my own synthesizer from scratch" is the kind of left turn all my projects take hahaha
https://fb.watch/5SHKSHIDKd/
Making stuff, and comedy in one video. Love it!
That one episode of Arthur.
well, if your doing audio now, then lets make a triangular VCO, for a synth
4:11.  Mans said hmmm money
But Arduino is incredible
You had a chance to add a FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER and you didn't....
That Papageno was less expected than the Spanish Inquisition.
"Only at a certain whole size, I get the maximum volume"
Always enjoy a good Electroboom video.
10:40 what it's the origin of that... jingle? It looks to be pretty international.
9:38 did you clone yourself in the process?
This is y u gotta pay attention to it electrical engineering courses (or else you'll end up like this)
Forget Tesla, your a [bleeping] Genius!
BuLgE ErEcTaTeD
Rip my headphones
plot twist: all of the censors are censoring the word BLEEPING
I hear a button for morse code
I miss the old days, that Mendhi made videos more often, and more interesting. Please more videos and more interesting.
The censored button
I can only imagine what your wife thought when you were singing.
3;59            YES
When I first began watching this one I was wondering where the sparks and flames could possibly come from making a beeper.  Obviously I had nothing to worry about.  How does this channel get by the YouTube Cops?
>if you read this i just want to thank you for making electronics intresting. i personally didnt have mutch with it but its super fun to learn it this way since most of the stuff you normally learn is so dry.
Anyone notice how hes saying bleep
I was excited to see him deal with debounce. Guess I'll be waiting a bit longer. :'(
that singing tho
I ate my horse 🐴
Video Idea: Can you somehow show at which point or at which voltages plastic also is be able to conduct electricity. Maybe with different items like cables, tool handels and so on. I know that ofc plastic is a bad conduit,  but if there is enough voltage, isnt there are a way that those very few free electrons in the molecular structure can carry the electricity ?
i want this bloboboblbobobbbb fasting tone xd
2:56 He DEFINITELY had to use the bleeping button after filming that lmao
"The circuit is quite simple"  9:20  O___O
How is your house not on fire at this point
why is he so good at singing
Now you need to make a circuit that say F$*& when you press the button
"Not a bulge erected in the middle of our pant. *confused look* BAND."  Mehdi was thinking about something else
Greatest invention from the greatest inventor ever 😂 I MEAN IT!!
I should have kept awake in physics class that stuffs cool
Every DAW user: _bruh 10 sec max_
I was playing beeping noises in my online classes a long time ago and my teachers called my parents
The chamber also prevents the sound from being pushed out of one side and sucked into the other side thus neutralizing a lot of the sound.
Shit, I have YT Premium so I don't have to watch shitty ads. And here we go, shitty ads by the content creator. Unsubscribed.
I have no problem with swearing. But I prefer bleeping because it is funny.  And yes, I know you bleep more than you actually swear. Which is also funny.
The most mind-blowing thing is we make a resonance chamber in our mouths without even thinking about it. We just make it on the fly
that vocal solo was actually super beautiful 😍😍
11:55 only at a certain hole size I get the MAXIMUM VOLUME definitely not a deek joke 1313
0:45 what is it good for? /absolutely nothing/
Just like me who would prefer to make analog circuitry to avoid a little hassel of learning Arduino.
Dude, can you do a singing stream, that was beautiful!
2:59 Medhi the TIE fighter
I would very much like a copy of the files that allowed you to 3D-print that oscilloscope :)
bro i love the work you do to make us laugh, cause you seem like a guy who learnt the theory physics properly but neglected the practical part. still love you man.
congrats you made a fucking button
Can you please check this video about an engine: https://youtu.be/FVaAfdY1ktU
how do led's work?
A
Video idea: Design a circuit to run one of those $5-$10 drones using the wireless energy produced by your Tesla Coil.
Juts in case someone is wondering he is saying fucking
Did you say $15 a year, I thought you had been saying $15 a month. Oh my bleep bleep
I don't know how to program Arduino either. But it never stopped me.
What? 😑
You should have used a squarewave instead of a sine wave because it has more harmonics which means it would be louder.
This is the best thing I've ever seen
2:59 of
0:44
There was many fires
Clown
So much fire cracking/sizzling sounds holy $@!*
And me thinking I’m to old to make entertain videos ?   This gentleman is always a inspiration :3
4:00 NO BLEEPING WAY!
I feel like he was calling out Michael Reeves in the coding and software part
That aria at 4:00 was actually quite ok! I'm actually myself considering skipping this electronics business and go to be an opera singer!
so easy, you only need 4 hands to demonstrate the diagram!
Why did he scream in lowercase when he banged his toe on the table?  I'd scream in uppercase

I always wanted to change Staples' "That was Easy" button to say "The was F_CKIN' HARD!"
Electroboom: Why you didnt use 555 timer chip?
2:57 gave me life
Me and medhi are same, we both can't code an arduino we only can do hardware. But we suck at software... ar you the same?
sir can you please make a video on Z-source inverter
"Censoring" button,  that's what he wanted to say in the title 😅
A 555 would have been simpler used fewr components and would run happily from a nine volt battery.
Actually, not a bad idea
For those who swear an awful pff lot, no stress just connect a CW keyer otherwise known by hams as a "Paddle"
Hi
This is a bleeping, awesome idea!
1:08 I don't know if anyone has interpreted deliberate bleeps as microaggressions yet, but it is definitely within the realm of Woke possibility
he made the button from the stream
Blublubliblububublu...
It's shame people consider programming to some high level thing. It is not and it never should be. Programming is just a tool. Mechanical, electrical, electronics, biology, physics math should and will always remain the core. It's okay Mehdi you don't need to know to program adruino 😊😊
Beautifully timed by the introduction of more speech censorship by the canadian government...
4:00 **bleep** YEAH! Time to **bleep** Sarastro!
I was confused before i watched this. Now I'm more confused, but entertained.
We are NOT HERE TO DO SOFTWARE. - as a programmer wannabe I felt that
backward technological progression
4:00 Channelling your inner monke?
"what you write some code and suddenly you know electronics" THANK YOU, as an electronics professor I'm tired of this software stuff and students only do the software part, never really taken an effort to learn circuits on a bread board. Yes it is important but electronics is so much more. It's not just coding.
If what is the DC power supply electro boom uses I would like to buy one that fancy 1
8:49 epic fail! Lol
who needs a bleeping button when you can just jump on top of the refrigerator and scream
The thing catching on fire just killed me lmao
4:02 Bravo, bravo! Submission for Canada's Got Talent, maybe? 🤣
he has to do a video on that tide brush
did he say hi using it? in Morse code?
Next time put a warning sound at the beginning for those who wear earphones. * bip * you, very much.
آقا مهدی مثل همیشه عالی، امیدوارم به زبان فارسی هم ویدئو ضبط کنی
WHAT THE &#!$
*Man who reads my comment wanted good health!!!*
Hmmm, I understand the opamps with positive and negative feedback, but you should have covered them in more detail for the other viewers!
I first thought "how interesting making a beeping button can be?" but Mehdi you exceeded my expectation and made again quite a nice video!
mehdi become a singer.
What is that little black thing with canon written on it?
Hi, when you learn arduino you can start with Raspberry Pi. I automated my entire house with it and can control it with a smartphone. And btw, you helped me with⚡part, so thanks!
how many times did he say the word "fucking"
Electroboom being a genius for 11 min 56 secs
Finally.. I can generate morse code by this &#$%ing button in college lectures which will understand by me and my best friend only.. 😅😅😅😜😜😜
We should normalize swearing. Youtube was so much better before
That singing was seriously impressive
8:49
Electro prince of persia
but what is that beep
you've made the worlds most useless Morse code machine
2:59 [music]
It's not funny anymore u meant to make that fire
He is Basically Making  Loudspeaker Morse code.
Gordon Ramsay, Pewdiepie, other people who need bleeps: **Invest**
Bleep
Finally, I always wanted to know on how to speak symbols. Can't wait to buy one! absolutely
Making a cursing button. ENEMY SPOTTED. TACTICAL DEMONIZATION! INCOMING!
8:42 is the timestamp for your standard ElectroBOOM goodness
''I am going to use a drug bottle for the speaker.''  5:29 Me ''What the f*ck''
Smoothest transition to the sponsor
What r u saying
I can't believe he actually burned himself intentionally for a video
İ'm so glad this is not what i learn in college
I almost flipped at 4:01. Not to mention you hit all the high notes perfectly but your staccato was shockingly good! This man has unlimited talents. 👏👏👏
HOLY S@&%
Having tinitus in both ears makes this video difficult to follow.
OMG! I once wanted to make one in elementary school too! I used a buzzer though. What do you expect? I was in elementary school.
try to chill 😆 you always angy on your videos 😆😆
Beeping <3
<Honestly for someone who doesn't swear this is useful, me>
Skip sponsore 😐
4:02 Is our beloved Mehdi moonlighting as a coloratura ?
He’s so evolving, like the shit he does randomly  then inspires his next projects, which all get him PAID!!
Triple twin😂😂
Pssh, I could do this with a raspberry pi, 400mb of node_modules and 1.5gb of ram.
SPOILER******ALERT******** U WILL NOT WANT TO WATCH THIS VIDEO AFTER THE FIRST 30 SECS ...YOUR HEAD IS GOING TO HURTT
The swear button is to high pitch
What the @#&%
If you think X86 assembly is hard, try programming the clock on a 90s VCR. In all seriousness, there is overlap between electronics and programming, one could argue switches  are an instruction, on or off or maybe it has multiple states or multiple switches which could function as a form of register. You could make a simple binary adder, including implementing your own logic gates with switches, transistors and LEDs to display the output, then feed it instructions using the switches to get your output. Depends how complex the system is and how many instructions and registers you are working with and if the circuit can recover instructions or data from those registers, yeah, it can get complex, but it all works on the same basis.
It's already early summer. Are you all doing well?     China should take full responsibility for spreading the corona to the world.  And that nation should be destroyed.
Understand this might be family friendly, but whats the point of makin this video if your bleeping every 2 seconds.
uncle mehdi, is it true that aerogel not only good for thermal isolator but also good at isolating electricity? '-')
Ayo what the f***
8:50 lol
That’s actually a really good falsetto rendition of “The Queen of the Night”
As a programmer i feel *bliiiiip* offended xD
You sing like a charm
What did you say at the end?
"Umm, I still don't know how to program Arduino, so we do electronics. :) "  same. Really, same.
he just say the n word 20 times very pog
Nice to know it's not only me that can't stand the arduino "wizards".
F**ing button i didn want but i needed
May the Gods of mistakes and fire be with you. Holy $h!t.🤣🤣 (But a fun video tho. Nice work)
I like how he’s covering his face for the “bleeping” at the beginning
So lovely background....😂😂
Electroboom‘s greatest hits. We have explosions, fire, resistor overheat, and physical trauma.  Good to have some stability
This video was awesome
the room has changed a lot after all this time
British people: reZIS-ta Mehdi: rezis-TORR
Use copper wire to make solar panels. Can it really be done? Watch the clip on youtube.
ELECTRO BANG
Right, you western white peoples are starting to censor yourselves, maybe a few years later you will get used to censorship all around you
Nice Mozart reference 😊
My online classes be like: beeeeeeeeeeeep!
Queen of the Night hell yeah
I love how his channel went from “Watch me shock the *BLEEP* out of myself!” to “Science!”
This is not a electronic channel,  this is  mainly a comedy channel and i love it ❤❤❤😂😂❤
Btw what is you favourite cuss word ?
Don't use beep sound
And btw you can learn morse and talk with code with your people to dominate the electro world!🔥🔥🔥🔥
Do among us
2:59 I felt that also that face tho
Swear-wave generator. Hehe.
Thanks for inventing arduino ... Nano especially 😌😌😌
beep beeep beeep beeep beeep beeep beeep beeep beep beeep 😂😂😂😂
2:22 Same
There's too many symbols in the title "fucking"
Electro Boom always makes good content 💯😤
LoL full monke mode at 4:00  Great vid!
That office chair must have broke due to all of the jumping, and excitement involved in testing out circuits for the first time!
but seriously, why _didn't_ you stick with a square wave?
You could always count his hair on his  arms to make sure it's the same guy doing the stunts this is for the guy below me
But I know this video is going to get demonetized demonetized I know yet because when somebody says it supposed to get demonetized when YouTube do you something inappropriate day do you monetize so💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
I work at a fast food place and I would so love a b#%@ button for some of the a**holes i gotta deal with daily
I love the transition sound 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That's the old CuriosityStream logo my man
Now oscillate it at 0.5 Hz, and you have a North American reverse beeper.  I made one a while back and installed it on my car, it was hilarious. Eventually I took it apart because I wanted the parts for another project.
Hello senior project
I don't even know you'll see this comment if you see please take a portuguese class because i'm br and i don't understand anything i use Google translator to understand what you say please i learned to speak portuguese please amo i love you very much Your videos are really nice and funny bjsss 😘
Swearing button I found it out
10:40 Mehdi just made a telegraph
God the Father sent His Son, Jesus, to take your punishment for your sins: to die on the cross. For the wages of sin [is] death; but the gift of God [is] eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 6:23, KJV) You must repent of all your sins, and believe and trust in Jesus. He loves you. He took your punishment, and suffered, because He loves you. He can forgive you. He can give you a new heart. Have a relationship with Him. He wants to have a relationship with you. God wants you to be His child.  God bless you all.
It's not 1kHz, but I got such a button(more of a buzz than a beep) off Target's discount aisle. It cost maybe $5 incl tax.
This idea is *****ing amazing!
Esse moço ainda está vivo?! Esse é imortal de tantos choques que já levou e continua vivo 🙀
*proceeds to cancel someone for a beeping sound*
I love your videos!
“Ruko” 😂😂😂. It’s Roku.
You will get a telegram transmitter if you connect it to a RF transmitter 😂
sorry for electro boom he has tried even though we failed to laugh but if we are in his position it's a pity to still support Chanel electro boom
I wonder if a 555 or 556 would also do the trick.
My God copying Michael leaves
Overloading of Service wires in Pole overheated & Got fired KPK.Energymeters burning.short circuit  https://youtu.be/jl52wBJyAkw
Sboooo
I (BEEP)ing like this guy.
That hand placement all through intro is just spectacular
Of course it's not a real &#!$%ing button if it doesn't shock the user
2:13 WE ARE NOT HERE TO DO SOFTWARE 2:59 Mehdi stubs his toes.  5:16, 6:26, 6:37, 7:12 Bublubllll
For those curious, what was made was a 4th Order Bandpass, admittedly a rudimentary one, but, still that alignment type never the less.
When you don’t monetised your videos due to lazy to edit a swearing part:  Mehdi: Make a [Beeping] button
Also you do know the thing in the background holding one of your scopes, is a 3d printer you could have printed a bad ass chamber
So many bleeps lmao
Wait "I still don't know how to program arduino" for reals?
Poor editor.
THINK ABOUT THE KIDS MAN!!
9:00 makes circuit on prototype board
You look like, sound like and act like an Iranian guy I worked with in Tokyo.
8:59 circuit working
8:50 set electronic on 🔥
8:43 capacitor died and blew up
Well done on the aria!
This dude reminds me of my uncle
2:59  OUCH
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen
So, when are you starting the OperaBOOM channel?!
LMFAO I've done this since i was a kid, without the beep sound 😂 Self censoring, Say the first letter sound, stop, finish the ending. literally sounds like "mother fu er" "god d mit" etc
Imagine that. Living in a society where words need to be censored because parents are lazy and hypocrisy is at an all time high. Kinda sad.
The fact that the hexagonal noise foam on the wall is not aligned in order, is a federal crime!
I've been watching you for YEARS and  still you teach me stuff I didn't know. I wish more YouTubers were like you. Educational yet funny and entertaining. Love ya, electroboom. All the (I can't say because I'm in the USA)
You should try dual frequencies to boost the harmonics.
Diana Damrau eat your heart out, there's a new queen of the night!!!!
Turn this into a Morse code transmitter!!
Or you could use Voicemod... But still good job.
Not the best video for a Tinnitus person like me.
This man is just jokes
2:17 i love you sir! xD
I did not expect the opera singing. Pleasantly surprised though.
_YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO_ 3:57
dude...would you ever speak on sound modules? they are what got me into thinking about electricity and what made me decide to become and electrician. we all love your videos btw!
That Iranian football cheer at the end tho xD
It sings :P
I think I’m going to make one of these, connect a key to it and learn Mores code.
Suggestion: make a Faraday Disk generator next! It generates a DC potential difference by spinning a copper disk in a magnetic field, causing electrons to move due to the Lorentz Force.
Nut
This was so good, no sound engineer school explained all this stuff so well.
Mehdi asking for help whit his morse code machine named "bleeping button"  Pretty clever eh?
Mann I missed uu
I wonder if he's being deliberate in the way he blocks his mouth when he swears. Has the YT algorithm gone as far as detecting swear words by reading lips?
Trending!!! Boom boom is the man!  Congrats on having the largest channel in the world! Woot boom boom! Woot!
A 1kHz sound wave is ~34cm long. If you have a speaker that small which is not at all enclosed at its backside, its probably the acoustic short cirquit that kills most of the volume ;-) So I think gluing the cap behind it was at least as important as adding the professionally tuned resonator.
Was that his real toe in that stubbing scene? Does he do his own stunts? We know he does. Bravery.
Great video👍
8:44 8:51 9:03 this is why you do it in software     that way it can only hurt your soul if you ⬜️⬜️⬜️ up
Next video: making AZ-5 button
I love your videos, you are the best! 💙 <3
Yes.
Love your videos
Make a high powered tea laser.
Hand cavity for speaker, tinnitus simulator?
I'm a old school analogue electronics fan anyway. No microcontroller for me.
I like how you´ve passed many years in YouTube, polished your editing skills, bought professional equipment, got sponsorship from many companies but you still use the same outro video you used since you started uploading videos. Trully marvellous dedication!  By the way, hope you get your burnt finger healed soon!
11:23 Imagine if he finished that with 6 CONSOLES 😂😂😂😂
4:45 that's what he said
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
Turning Point After hearing all of this, I knew the situation was worse than I'd thought. I called my brother again.  “Do you remember the audio lectures I gave you earlier?” I asked, “right now, I suggest that you focus on listening to them and do the excises.”  My brother accepted my advice.   When I called him the next day, my brother said he had done the excises and felt very good.   “You have told me you had not needed medicine these years. Is it true?” he asked.   “Of course,” I replied.   In fact, my situation was like his when I was young. In addition to poor lung function, I also had liver problems. But after beginning to practice Falun Gong over 20 years ago, I have been fine.   Since our phone conversation, my brother did the exercises and listened to the lectures every day. His health also got better and better. Not quite sure about his condition, I asked if he should have a checkup at the hospital again.  “No need,” he said, “I am healthy now. What is the point of going to hospital?!”  My uncle was also thrilled. He noticed that my brother looked better, was able to eat well and was very happy.   Several days before I wrote this article, I had a video chat with my brother. He looked great. My uncle added that my brother often caught a cold in the winter, but he has been fine. Everyone in the family is happy.   Because of censorship, I could not speak much over the chat. But I did remind him to continue practicing Falun Gong. “Keep doing what you are doing. Okay?” I said.   “Of course!” he replied, “You can count on that.”  I had thought to ask my brother to share his experience himself, but since I can't return to my hometown due to the new lockdown measure, I wrote the article on his behalf. Our whole family thanks Master Li (the founder of Falun Dafa) for saving my brother.
2:38
Glad the circuit component values were posted. That's for us viewers in Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
My first electronics project ever, several decades ago, was similar to that, albeit using a 555 to generate a square wave and using a LDR to control the oscillation frequency. No fire was involved.
It would be great if u could make a moving robot
Mehdi is making a code oscillator for learning Morse Code :D
Trump had the button..diet coke coming up!
lucky me those 1970s circuit kit help understand art of soldering. i too burn hand reaching the fallen soldering iron & AC is way to dangerous to touch.  so i went on to a safer hobby Firework, too bad whole grass field burn we save some building. huh 4 hands detailing the schematic circuit...
4:15 holy! You can sing!!!
*Try to make some button that can severely damage your power supply on your town😂😂*
That was *beep*~ing amazing
Making a "bleep" button might be the most Canadian thing I have heard in 2021 so far... And I **bleeping** love it!
Gee, I’d like a fiscal button too.
When my neighbor is in his garden with his hi-fi turned up to the max, I could use one of these to **** him off. Small compact and irritating just like he is. 😆
You definitely need an idea, this video is as weak as a snake's piss. We know about sponsors.
Name of the piano piece, pleeeease!
goddamn ****
your studio now looks nice
I suggest you connect the bleeper to your residual current detector, then when you receive a shock, your expletives will be automatically deleted.
Wait a second, he 3D printed a ****** oscilloscope!😂
I am glad to see u back ElctroBoom
hello electroboom i'm a fan of yours, i like your videos a lot but i don't know english very well so i'm using a translator, but it would be possible to put portuguese subtitles for me and my friends please
....what
Nobody: " " Absolutely nobody: " " Mehdi breadboard: * *SETS ON FIRE* *
In ham radio world these circuits are called keyers and are used to drive morse keys (for practicing without sending electromagnetic nonsense on the air or as aural feedback while transmitting on old radios which don't have one integrated). Modern keys use two separate switches for dots and dashes, so that the operator doesn't have to time the ons and offs manually. This introduces some complexity in the circuit and so many enthusiasts have moved from a fully analog design (some can still be found online) to an Arduino based...this is sad, not only because  of what Mehdi said about learning, but also because typically Arduino doesn't go boom :D
Everyone talking about the &#!%ing button but does know one notice the new background
I want you to team up with Michael reeves so badly
Vary funny video keep up the great work
2:55 wow you actually did it for the video Kheili Mardi haji Zadam like'o
This is very unrelated to the main topic of the video, but the way you used your hands to cover your mouth in the beginning in a seemingly-natural way was a pretty clever way to self-censor! Not that I would've minded if you actually swore, I just appreciate the interesting framing
Oh Mehdi, do I see a... new studio there? XD
1233 angel number
Need some good thing?, this is a some good thing
Sometimes youtube Demonetizes you when you bleep cause it assumes Swearing...
It will be amazing if you're boss see this video😂
I'm very disappointed the button isn't shocking ;p
Arduino coders Codes a pezio buzzer at a high frequency XD
My destroyed electronics bin has like 5 of the same product , a couple of which I took apart.. the rest is low voltage besides a 400-volt cap and 250-volt cap I stole from some household electronics  (and a several kV thing that is for air purifiers)
By the way , this "story of electricity" documentary is available for free on YouTube 😂
"They had us in the first half not gonna lie"
You know something bad is about to happen when he hides underneath his table while explaining something
frig your smart
8:51 oh sh*t
9:02
Hey can you do a shunt current sensor using 10k resistor or 20  I just want to test that out.... that will be nice Edit :-   It won't work T-T
2:16 damn , he roasted every coder + himself lol
8:48
8:43
So in other words you want to install a horn on your system.....LoL
Schmitt
Glad I am in software engo. Phew...
6:14 that's how my PC fan sounds like lol the exact same frequency sound.
Electro boom a cappella group. Wonderful
Looks like you just 3D printed another Oscilloscope.
5:15 - The response from that weird kid that's jumping and running around at a party, when you try to talk to it
I want one.
ElectroBOOM is meanie to me Waaaaa. I'm 13 and esp32 is kinda hard. Yeah right only REAL MEN CAN DO REAL ELECTRONICS. But I am 13 and esp32 is still hard.
With 1% of the daily energy from this man, I could run my server for a week 🤔
Should have used a 555...  /s
Hey did you just 3D print an osciloscope? That's even better than free energy devices!
He used the speaker sound to censor his bad words
Cool project, but still so sad with the obsession of "dirty" words. Not saying you need to go fuck every three words but curse words are part of a language as well. Also, censorship is bad, mkay.
Ever use a resistor for a fuse? Apple has!
@$$
That singing is actually really impressive
CONGRATES FOR BEING ON TRENDING IM SO PRROUD
F button
I heard  early 1900's some farmers were sending  morse code to each other     by using    elect  powered   fence  is this true  🤔
4:01 is now my official alarm ringtone 😁👍
I did not expect Mehdi singing Der Hölle Rache today...
Holly beep
Swearing with a good way 🤣🤣
Ha ha ha I’m in tears 😭 so bloody funny. Send me one please
a what button? use real words.... NEVER CENSOR ANYTHING! censorship is nothing more than willful ignorance, dont be ignorant, dont censor anything, not ever. no matter how much youtube pays you, it wont be enough to buy back everyones freedom of speech.  iv never supported the censoring of your videos, and is one of the few i made exceptions for, but this one i sooo bad its mandatory that i give it a dislike.
I want one ha ha
AT LEAST! I know something that electroboom doesn't know (programming arduino), but i think that with all this stuff he knows it's a matter of seconds...
I asked about his PLC and microcontroller experience during the livestream (cuz that's what I do). I feel attacked.
uncensord title :making a fucking botton
Your @#$%ing room looks @#$%ing gorgeous! Did you let someone else clean your place? :D By the way, excellent control of your voice! Also, was that ElectroCute back on the ivories?

Somebody should make one of these but using vacuum tubes (or thermionic valves). When you need to swear just plug the unit in and wait fifteen seconds for it to warm up.

Due to the acoustical resonance of the chamber you can put a pickup mic inside the chamber. If you amplify this signal and send it to the speaker the resulting feedback will be at the resonant frequency. Devices like smoke alarms use this technique with piezo elements to make loud tones using very little electricity.
That confetti effect... never gets old
holyshit best innovation
What?
Electroboom question how you crazy idea come from ?
You could have just used a more powerful speaker instead of making all that headphone speakers aren't meant to be loud   But it made the video longer and more enjoyable so never mind
will the next project involve Arduino?
Reminds me of the incident with Shunt.
2:03 any engineer says this about their field. True though, same with any field.
Notice how he keeps his hand in front of his mouth everything he say bleep 0:10
Please make a video about dipole antenna..
"we typically want a flat response" *laughs in Raycons*
Are You persian?
We need to give him a standing ovation
Hy Mehdi, can u make this kind of stuff with spitting-like sound? Will be a nice device. U can hit the button while walking near someone on the street.
What about a hardware audio amplifier that also messes up the sound so it sounds spooky? Would be great next project :D
How to get attention of a crying baby... 5:16
Wut
4:00 What the *bleep* just happened there?
Replace every bleep with f**k

Fucking button
8:49  and I thought: he can't explode or set fire to anything in this simple project.
This guy is always so fun to watch
10:02 this is not triangular it's shark fingular LoL 😂
@3:59 You can sing pretty well! :)
I love how he turned away and just casually a fire appeared , he is not actually an electrical engineer he's just a pyromancer but tries to hide it
standing ovation for the best opera singer ever
I've seen a tram driver use his bell as this button
why would I risk setting my home on fire while I can just use a simple 6 instruction code Arduino?
8:48 he was so cool until he realised the circuit was on fire 😂😂😂😂😂
did anyone notice that mehdi intentionally put the circuit on fire by keeping the cloth thingy on it
8:50 ... lol
liked for algorithm
Moment of the day  3:00
Fletcher-Munson dude.  Fletcher-Munson.
5:16 My new notifications ringtone
I love how he's somehow censors the F words with his hands too
You should start a comady channel
"Like When you stub your toe" 1 second later Turns into a dinasour
ElectroBoom should get into DIY audio. Its a really fun niche of electronics and physics.
You rigged the Drug Bottle to amplify 1kHz, but the output of your circuit sounds more like 2kHz i think. I see 1kHz on the Scope though... why is that?
genius
lesson learn , do not wipe electric equipment with alcohol and turn it straight on , wait for it to dry thx electrboom
4:03🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
STOP IT!
You are awsome. You know the stuf. 😎🤠💪
Im just gonna insert random words like  What the oscilloscope
Just pathetic... Real men build MULTIVIBRATORS! Only transistors, only hardcore.
Нифига не понял, но очень интересно.
Where did all the electrocution go away?🥲
sir please do videos more often
That new background lookin goooooooood 😏
8:49 What the...[BLEEP]!!
Hey brothers and sisters, I love y'all and it's just been in my heart today to share that Jesus love y'all so much and unconditionally. I don't know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let's leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. " Also in 2 corinthians 4:18" So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal." Time is so short. And I always say this" I want all of us to be saved. " Jesus is coming back soon." with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let's take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn't easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I don't want to force anything on anybody or even force them to do something they don't. But if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don't want anyone I love, know/don't know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He know us, He knitted us in our mother's womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it's beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don't understand it. So I want to tell you it's time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let's not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that's why He didn't think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back.   How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day🙏🏾. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin. NOW, is the time to turn to JESUS, do it before its too LATE and the DOOR of Grace is Shut.  Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ🙏  Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior.  Spreading the Gospel on every content🙏❤️🤗
10:20 Everytime he $&%*@#, his hand is in front of his mouth. I don't know if this was intentional or not, but it's funny in my opinion.
Learning in fun way
Imagine you made this for your school project and it doesn't work in front of your teacher while you swear  •_•
Society is so fucked up.... why did we ever have to invent censoring 'bad' words, if it doesn't change anything anyway?? - It's so ridiculous, and it makes me sad.
In Scotland, swearing at people is just friendly conversation :)
Dude I love how you hurt yourself on open electrical circuits. As an electrician I know how it feels and most of the time it's just a jumpscare instead of hurts but be carefull with burns man because one day you'll end up with a real nasty burn mark and views aren't worth getting permanent damage, Take care
Isn't this the guy that used to shock himself for no reason?
Him: circuit is simple  *Shows the circuit  Me: that seems pretty much impossible
At 10:39, this melody seems very famous. I immediately knows how it will ends.  Who brainwash us with this melody???? Who????   p/s: What is the melody name? Help?
4:01 ME XD LOL
Mehdi is 3D printing full bridge oscilloscopes now. Incredible.
4:20 👏
Hohohohoohohohohohoho
"Bill-ill-ill-illl-ill-ill-ill-illl-ill-ler"
God those Keysight scopes are fancy. 5:22
Is he not going to acknowledge the fact that he got this idea from that youtuber that talked about an episode in Arthur??
Useful thing!
He’s so evolving, like the shit he does randomly  then inspires his next projects, which all get him PAID!!
Battery - Button - piezo 👍
Lets talk about LATITY :)
9:19 Not me, I didn't master electronics. :(
9:17 the circuit is quite simple... 3 secinds later: already shows a graph i cant understand lol XD
Gintama used this technique to fullest
ElectroBLEEP? 😅😁✌
2:59 i &#!$ing felt that
Legend is back
i did learn about frequency resonancy, i didn´t know  that way of tune the speaker for a specific resonance frequency.
Notice how he covers his mouth with his hand when cursing
The most canadian invention ever.
You are a rockstar Mehdi
Finally a circuit. I understand and completely knows how the circuit functions.
11:56 i didnt see that one coming
lol he is saying "beeping" if true like my comment electroBOOM mm i found this out before he said and now i just feel dumb for commenting this
Lol fu****
He obliterated that table with his toe
so original and awesome!
Hey mehdi , your background is looking good .
I hope you and wren from corridor (crew) will have a collab! Will be a very funny video <3
Ngl you had me in the start.
Why did he change the frequency of the beep?
My fav. Youtuber❤️❤️
Mrs Mehdi has ikea’d his workshop. All workshops need decorative plants 🪴 lol
I don't even skip the sponsor part  of his video 😂
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
پرچم ایرانو بردی بالا با این ویدیو هات و ۴ میلیون سابت🔥🔥💪💪🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷
2:58 Real stunt !!
"You write some code and suddenly you know electronics!? You don't know a damn thing!" Did not have to be so targeted at me.
4:10 he is the next vitas
I was wonder how to make a Fucking button !?!!
FUUUUUUUUUU!!!! How about a CW next time you want to kick a table leg barefoot? I'm screaming in sympathetic agony here
This new setup looks so satisfying
I love that he put his hand in front of his mouth while saying &#!$%ing just to prevent us from knowing wich word he's saying :o
ᴵ'ᵐ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵉᵛᵉʳʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˡᶦᵏᵉ ᵃⁿᵈ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉ ❤️❤️
Nice background man
درود بر شما کجایی هستی شما
I'm curious where you learned to visually censor your mouth like that. Kudos for that!
Ya its not like we can edit and put bleep sound..
8:30 good move sir
Is this what electrical, and mechanical engineers do
Mhďmn.
Not sure if Electroboom really needs this. Usually his swearing is covered up by the buzz of high voltage discharge.
Oh boy, this channel has gone very far. I remember the days when the "electric" guitar went published.
1 min in and already entertained
"BEEP" i thing this name of this Video !
Ek no. 🔥🔥🔥
Please use your live stream thumbnail as your video intro.
😂
Stop explaning all this things at this board we cant understand that you draw
just use an Apple airtags.
My  tinnitus approves this video.
Does 2:16 apply to me :)
New background new equipment gg
Bicycle dynamo! Please do a bicycle dynamo which could be used to charge a smartphone :D
Its &#!$%ing good.
F For the poor toe
Looks like Medhi 3D printed Oscilloscope 😂😂
the title of the recent video should have been "elecroBOOM is live for juicy money"
Love your videos. I always learn something I didn't know before. Plus, you're hilarious 😂
Alternative title: making a morse code key and calling in an airstrike
Ad : skip
The more i hear the fire burning, the more im scared of Mehdi
most dislikes are by Arduino gang
Nice New Background
🤣
9:42 do we have 2 mehdis?
2:42 ngl i thought it'll explode or something
04:49 I can't explain why, but when he played that tone I hear these jumble words in my head.  "This is a test of the Emergency Broadcast System." "the Attention Signal you just heard would have been followed by official information, news or instructions."
This is the moment when mehdi becomes daft punk
Look at that fancyyy studiooo !!!!!!
I love these videos. Hope you all are doing well!!
Why you are not an opera singer !
2:59 o.0
thats a nice fucking button
Your pretty on point with those pitches man. Maybe you should go on american idol instead of shocking yourself all the time XD hahaha!!!!! Nah it's way more cool when you get shocked XD
I love you
Wowwww dude lmfao! That's f[]<>?(),&_%n awesome that you've created this simple yet awesome thingy lol
I was thinking  If u ad some LED lights between these hexagons on your wall  It may look better
Great project to strengthen knowledge of electricity! My first thought was "that's a 5 minute Arduino project" but I love what this ended up being. Thanks for the videos, this is one of my favorite channels!
8:27 are you sure about that? ;) ;) ;)
We need Eddy from twoset to verify the frequency and verify the opera singing 😂😂😂
USE THIS WHEN YOU ARE ANGRY FOR YOUR PARENTS !@#$%#@ 🤬
4:00 THAT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL MEHDI, 👏👏
یه افسانه هست که میگه مهدی هزارسال یبار ویدیو میزاره
Can you believe he's raising a child? What a lucky young girl
Please can you do a video on how solar energy feeds into grid. The tech stuff with schemes and math. Like what voltage hits the lines. How switching and voltage monitoring is handled.  I only ask cause you have the knowledge and smarts. I can't find info on this anywhere.
the room is improve nice to avoid accidental contact 🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭
It's so well done at the beginning that he covers his mouth every time he says it to not spoil the joke
Nice renovation of the room
"It's been a while since I've shocked myself, so now let's make the circuit."
The sun is frew energy but i just takes alot of time to get the energie
This circuit is missing one very important component. And its is a  FUUUL BRIDGE RECTIFIER !! Even if it’s completely useless 💪
Please make a acustic chamber
Your new setup looks nice!
BBH needs this
3:59
I really like the backdrop!
2 things i'd be afraid to be  a) his insurer b) his hands/hair/eyes/etc.  i'm fascinated how he hasn't lost any body part yet... loving every video, btw
What is the balls doing in iphone acoustic chamber of the loud speakers
Nice background btw
why u tuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuutttt yourself soooooooo muchhhhh ?
New and organized office, pretty nice!
I honestly prefer the sound cutoff during bad language that was being used in the past.
Very strategic covering of the mouth while swearing lol
Man is good morse code but trash censure button, LOUDERRRR
Hey that sound like it started with a N  CANCEL!!! Also so annoying that technology has to separate schools one hand I love programming but engineering is so interesting too
I think you're one of the best filmmakers mehdi XD
🇮🇷🇮🇷🇮🇷
10:20 no use I heard everything
The fact that this was easier to him than an arduino.... 😂😂😂😂😂😂
هولي شتيت
10:20 can i buy it to my mom 😂😂
Mehdi was already using the beep button, when he gets shocked..
Overengineering in a nutshell
Can you use it to make a morse code transmitter too.
you are getting more funny the more old you are becoming ....
@ElectroBOOM You should change your Chanel's mame to ElectroBOOM lite.😑
The button should shock you whenever you press it to avoid swearing
Mehdi in the airport : this is just my @$•¶¥=€ button it is  not drug airport security : sir please give us the Bottle
I like the new background!
2:13 "We are not here to do software"  Why not? Besides you promised arduino videos :(
https://youtu.be/XKiZF8iQsk8
When you order Mr. Bean online
"alot of people prefer F*#!*ng over... well... not F(#*&$ng"  very true
Yes it was a simple project but we learned a lot
I love how he covers his mouth at every bleep
By God's grace he drill his fingers.
Wait, isn't the classic censor tone a triangle wave?
nice
I’m watching this drunk and I was not disappointed
He is busy on decorating the background
LEL
So I'm glad that I live in Germany. Here I can say "SCHEIẞE" as often and as loud as I want, without censoring it.
Fucking. Is UwU
the button also does something else, trigger tinnitus.
Your room changed a lot since 2mil
hello mr.mehdi sadaghdor i wanna ask you something simple can you make a homemade solar panel if you can make a video about, please
Poland has the best beep button: kurwa!
3:00 so true
The Rebellion is looking for new recruits today! ✴ Who will join us? We have free cookies and blue milk! 🍪 🍶
4:01 electroboom turns into operaboom
New background, Very niceeeeee
I learned much more from this video than I initially antecipated!
Since when your background got clean and arrange
Can you make radio?…...……………answer
You should talk about the video that was recently uploaded on Veritasium!
Electroboom is now Electrobeep     My ears got f**ng damaged by the beeps!!!!
Cool backgrounds
I like the effects 🙂
so its a bleeping button?
Thanks for helping me to design a Bluetooth speaker.
I actually registered to CuriosityStream after years of resisting to these sponsored messages. I've been missing out.
The background you have is absolutely beautiful
this video gonna take alotta edit🤣
F**k, hey it worked
Congratulations for the great singing! :)
This was a fun video like all of your videos, untill you showed the clip of Jim Al-Khalili. Then it became monumental!  I do hope you repeat some of the experiments contained within that particular documentary as it is absolute gold and the man is a true gentleman.  Any fans of electroboom that haven't seen Jim Al-Khalili's documentary on electricity owe it to yourselves to watch it.
Is this some kind of american joke i'm too european to understand?
"We need more holes"                                    -Electroboom, 2021
That sounded like more than 1khz
Very cool to see Jim Al Khalilli making a brief guest appearance in one of your videos.... even if it is only in the sponsorship spot.
It's really annoying how delicate Americans are when it comes to swearing. Bleeping out swear words, which is just a normal way to speak, is so fucking annoying.
8:43  *There it is!!*  8:50  *There it is again!!*  9:03  *And again!!*
The Iranian Wizard is Back
8:43 and the following bonfire. 10/10
Bleeping the word “@#$&%ing” multiple times to make it seem like you’re cursing… Next @#$&%ing level. Haha.
I think I've to make one
Dunno how I got on here.....just the curiosity factor..........but it was quite interesting all the same in a weird kind of way, more like waiting for the bigga da boom.......I'm too old and set in my conventional ways to be impressed.......I think it has come down to coming to terms with todays generation and how they relate to things.........I'm outta here....gone.
finally, that one episode of Arthur makes sense now
6:37
This guy is very fun to watch i am a subscriber since this channel has less than a 800k subscriber 🤣🤣
Mehdi, you never used to need a bleep as much as you do now. Your channel used to be more family friendly.
Haha this is funny
Bruh. That new setup tho. Lookin SUPER clean Also, that stubbed toe looked legit! Hope it didn't hurt
you killed my headphones
Isn't swearing etiquette weird? Everyone knows what you mean but people get mad if they hear it?
I got my new ringtone
for the 335 dislikes. bleeb on youu
,#-&_&;(+&$_ haha
8:50 LMFAO 😂😂
Mehdi is the new Queen of the night !!!
The fire at 08:50 :)))
Can we take a moment appreciate the organised setup?
2:26 there we are, thought we could use some parts in the future so we stored those in the corner. I can feel that hand reaching some retro-electronics part
8:43 This was the moment I watched the whole video for XD I basically don't have much of an interest in electronic stuff bu,t after watching you, I feel like I'm addicted 😄
a brilliant idea for Iranian governors for filtering anything they want Thanks Mahdi ❤
Am I the only mildly infuriated by the fact that his beeping machine is not 1000 Hertz but like 1058?
Is nobody gonna mention how the final product's pitch is higher than 1k hz?
"people fill in the blank in their heads" mehdi basically explained why censorship is unnecessary and makes no sense
The opera singing was better than I've seen in the Vienna Operahaus where Beethoven and Mozart performed!
4:02 Ah yes monke electroboom You love to see it xD
I love &#!$%ing button!
why you using emergency alert system 1050hz noaa weather radio to your toxic button
8:27
10:15, just wow🤣
You are a Legend!  Greetings from Patagonia Chile!!!
4:00 just saving for myself.
you make a toxic button
see it dont ask 10:37
5:35 And in hindsight you should have called it a *Mehdi* - cine bottle
holy shit he actually did the 5th element opera
@8:56 .. Stop acting innocent. We know you did that on purpose 😂
and btw mehdi u looks so cute while singing
good idea mehdi
I wish him and mykull reeeeeeves collab someday
We are not here to do software! 👍😎🤘
You can go store and buy a buzzer and switch and a battery
Am I the only one who noticed how well he sings?!!??!??!!!!
10:40 super LOL
One of your &#!$%ing videos
Finally, editing an ElectroBoom video can be 70% easier now
Good video.
This video got me turned on
If Mickey Mouse sang opera.
Wait why not make an oscillator that oscillates at 1kHz and then amplifying it? Is the circuit in the video more efficient than that?
Bruh Moment,When You Censored Everytime You Swearing Word?
4:02
This is the exactly what i wanted
This guy is so #%@&$! Funny. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🍺
Next episode; He wired his bleeping button into the phone line and created his own device for transferring morse code ^^
Quest complete:-  Gain : 100 xp Intelligent : +6 New Skill Tree Unlocked : Morse code
He looks alot like Rick Hoffman
I'll just use my multimeter continuity
new info from what seemed  like a bored video, thanks mehdi, that chamber looked like upside down bladder :D
I will only pay for CuriosityStream if electroBOOM gets on there, but then i will pay $40 a year.
Oh, I am sad, I write software and I don't know a damn thing about electronics.
That’s a great idea !!! Send me one .... you have a great imagination...
4th order bandpass chamber 🙂
2:57 I felt that
You are smart from every &#!$%ing directions
I DIDNT COME HERE TO SEE MEHDI DO SOME SHT I AM HERE FOR SPARKS EXLOSION AND NEAR DEATH EXPIERIENCE SHOW ME MORE OF THOSE
The new setup looks Nice
Please make a video on Arc Reactor (Tony's heart)
Can it be modified to produce Mystery Biscuits?
Mehdi, O Mehdi.. 😂😂 what would I do without your vids.
Mehdi : uploaded a video.. YouTube : something gone wrong.. No body : adventures happens
Did anyone notice that ElectoBOOM have updated his background?
Other title:the censored video
My teacher in 8th grade-  2:20
10:20 Mehdi is scarier than a drug dealer in a bloody corner.
Good job them high notes were short may have had a accident if longer lol
ElectroBOOM is very passionate to obey the rules
do i see ELGATO WAVE PANELS??
Generally i hate Canadians because Canadian people have negative opinions about India. But I like electroboom
this can be used to swear in morse code
Fun fact electro boom makes good sounds
I simply download app from playstore problem solved
Well I love the way he advertise 😁😁
💥
8:51 did anybody want some marshmallows?
no electrocute 😅
This is an Ear Rape episode
Nice work, now make the Roblox "oof" sound
ill die dumb, i learned we love holes
I Love your videos. They Bring me so much Joy!
Can we make an electronic sanitizer 😛😛😛😛😛
2:55 Mehdi fr punted the side of his table for a joke. We do not appreciate him enough
0:32 No!     **Peep**  because, kids are watching you!!!
"It's a simple project"  Lights the board on fire*
Morse code
That was some good singin'
The title should be: *"Why need to curse when there is a button that can do for you"*
When I saw the video title, I was thinking of a metal foil covered button that when pressed, generates a high voltage that causes the person to @#&$#!
He’s so cute
What? A button that makes a sound? There is nothing to learn for me here. 10m later. 100 google tabs are open to search all the new information received. Amazing content
I need this mother#$%!ing thing.
*!?%?*, I think I will visit that site. What’re you gonna do
Damn what a nice room زیبا بود
I am UUUUU
He looks stupid but he is smart sometimes
why dont you use a simple buzzer
Okay... You got a like from me.. That transition to the ad was smart as %$#@
I did this in a third grade class move on
Honestly the opera singing did it for me. That was super impressive 👌
Awesome background
mad lad
I am pleased to be in Mehdi's class
I want to make it
Awsome video
am I the only one satisfied because he cleaned his background?
Please do collaboration projects with Michael Reeves...
Thanks for the laughs.
So many _______
once again, wht the f(x) of 3d printing behind him?
Keep up the good work electroboom
That toe stubbin' tho.  That was real wasn't it.
morse code. hmmm
A bleeping button? Why not change the title tho, that video title is so good
I’ve been working on subtitles for his videos. It’s pretty hard, considering the constant censorship of pain.
You can do opera.
lol medhi room has been change
Wow nice setup
9:03 it took long enough
What's the purpose of connecting the output of the op amp to VCC through a resistor ?
9:47 ah yes 4 hands
6:56 “Flexible Electric Tape”  NOW THAT’S A LOT OF DAMAGE !
Would make a heck of a clear Morse code communicator.
why not press the Button 🖲
Lmfao a ****ing button?
till @8:42 i was like "hey mehdi where is the explosion and sparks "  after @8:43 yeaa... now it's electro boooom......
Ahh, not much entertaining as the jacob's ladder video!!
If anyone is going to make a lightsaber it’s this guy
MORSE #$%*ING CODE !
Hey, he changed his background settings 😄..
How long did that scope take to print on that Lulsbot TAZ PRO? any solder bridging or cold joints?
I thought the *$:-@ing part was only in the THUMBNAIL     But Mehdi told it for like 1 minute that        Cracked me
mehdi: its LIKE STUBBED YOUR TOE IN TO A KITCHEN TABLE  wife:what's he up to again 2:57
Lol 🤣🤣🤣
8:29 😆
I appreciate the editing skills in this video
4:02 Thanks for the Ringtone 🙏
Yeah! Lets make bleeping sound itself a swear word! In your face, censorship! :))))))))))))))))))))
Damn your room is looking cleaner that ever 😂❤️😁
4:10 Such a wow
jerry springer wants to know your location
Now he will finally do a lot of live streams  😁yay
4:20 👏👏
Ok but what does it do ?
ElectroBOOM has the best build montages.
I use an arduino uno
10:40 sus
some one had a room make over !!!
Im back from ..er.. life.. and I find this on my Subscriptions. Ur still editing epikly, nice!  2:00  ElectroBOOM: "So ppl use Arduino.. ... . ...YOU DONT KNOW A DAMN THING of electroniks! I still dunno Arduino, we do electronics" YT AD:  "Unlike Other Startups that believe they can change the world, *Arduino believes we have already revolutionised the world* ; we even have our products launched by NASA to the space station and research is being conducted-"  YouTube Algorithm Big Brain  LOL U still didnt update ur outro haha. GG. Loved the vid. But Im pretty sure Im gonna use some editing options in BlackMagic DaVinci Resolve as usu! xd.
It more like comedian
Nice Opera singing
I love learning about electrical engineering and what not to do while being a electrical engineer making a project just dont die when you so this stuff electro you rock
This needs to be the system that teachers use, it’s entertaining, you learn a lot, and easily comprehensible. Keep it up man!
i thought it said !@#$ing button if you know what i mean.
You're good at this. You even got me to pay attention to your sponsor's ad and that's hard to do.
You made a morse foot paddle. lmao
2:59
Mehdi, you were right! Curiosity is the best!
👌👌👌👌
4:35 You’re raising the decibel of the speaker.
That opera was beautiful.
That was a pretty good Queen of the Night solo. I'm glad you referenced that!
What camera are you using now? You are in sooo hi def 😅😁
Make something that zaps you whenever you swear
you sacrificed a toe D:
Make and explain a Solenoid engine
10:40 explain electroboom
It's perfect how his hands hide his mouth everytime he says *beep".
Damn Mehdi do be hitting them high notes tho.
Why didn't you use an LC oscillator? Hartley or wien bridge oscillator for example.
4:02 wtf my dude wtf!!!
Linus has such a button. Shamelessly bringing up LMG... I know.
Your wierd noises while reading those amplitude will be my notification
Lmao mehdi can't code 🤣
You can be a Singer 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Buldge in bands ,nice joke  Missing fool bridge rectifier in your new project
nice change in background
4:45 "Only at a certain hole size, i get the maximum volume" ElectroBoom 2021...😂😂😂
Bro can you make an inverter . A square wave or sine wave . You wish .
8:43 XD
I still don't know a damn thing
I wish I was smart enough to understand what you taught us in this video, it was truly fantastic! Thanks Medhi!
I'm an expert at reading lips, and during the beeps he said he's going to donate to the research for the cure to gullibility
Imagine he's saying smurf :)
Will use it for Online classes🤣🤣🤣
The blocking of the hand gestures covering your mouth at the beginning was beeping funny!
Is awesome hoy he cover his mouth when he bleeps
that segway it as terrible as his electrical handy work LOL!
My mind when it just started burning when he turned it on and moved back😂😂😂 well at least i learned any thing
little did we know, he has the voice of an angel
0:32 He literally said the word "Bleep" 🤣🤣🤣
Just like SIP chips from YEARS ago?!!!!
Electronics, science AND Mickey Mouse singing opera. What a channel
told you he will make a tower of scopes behind him
A clickbait I don't regret falling for
As a self proclaimed EE I have yet to set a breadboard on fire,  I guess I need to go back to school to learn that trick 😁
Mehdi should write a book.
What swear word is saying ??
You've done amazing work in this video. This is really, really well made
5:16 needs to be a text tone
Shifting or fucking lol
Dude, you should make a course for CuriosityStream ... that would be awesome.
8:43
Проверить бы эту самоделку полнаяхуйняметром)
many years ago I put about 570v across a 1/4 watt resistor and it exploded. I charged up a bunch of caps and put them in series to get that output.
hmmm i paused the vid and the ringing sound is still playing. wierd
Wat
What
BEEP
Lol the eeeeeeyaaaaaaa
Do a studio or workstation tour Press like if you agree  👇
Who dare dislike this video shame
Nice job with the magic flute! 😃
Teachers need this button.
The question remains: should i cancel the brazzers subscription or the disney+ one to make room for curiositystream?
Australian people: *holds the button for their entire lives*
You've just made a Profanity Button.
ahh, that waveshape{10:12) is much more nature then a clear mathematical sinus... and... imagine, everything including any sound pulses(PCM) is filtered by damned sinus and i cant do ear-surfing without specific operational-amp solution, electronical oscillated shape is much better then mathematical(call it digital for sure), sorry for offtopic
My grandpa asked me why I someone was saying to attack Russia using frozen eggs on the telegraph!
ONE One &#!$%ing Button... Ahhh ahhh ahhhh. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-Wd-Q3F8KM
2:59 I almost made me spit out my food
This video is the real definition of "Learning is fun" 😃
The result seems to emits a tone slightly higher than the 1kHz from the beginning.
Hi I love ya vids pls make an actual free energy generator:)
I would pay to watch electroboom sing opera
Only some can notice the video quality have changed
nice background ! well done with the designing
2:59 yo he destroyed that toe wtf
More like morse code....machine
MEHDI'S new studio ROCKS 😎
I thought he would just put the signal on the microphone wire
What a #$&$%*#$
Nice background medhi
It's also a Morse Code keyer
Love from INDIA😎🇮🇳😎
Guys let's all pretend he said the most racist things when @$!##!'s
Idkw this is funny to me 😂 8:50
Potato
Lel
Another use: when you have those test cards
My dog was stressed out hearing this video
Around 5:00 I love the burn marks on your breadboard. Checks out....
See also: https://youtu.be/KUkjrWDv200?t=85
Can i get 3d printer that prints unlimited oscilloscopes?
Just GIMMIE DA METER already!
I actually understand everything in the circuit cz I am studying all of this sings in a apart course for general engineer you must know .
Why do you doo the beep sound in America if you say a swear word?
yo electroboom! i used to take LEDs in my digital electronics class and cranck the voltage up just to make em explode! the scent of burnt LEDs bring me so much memories :3 oh ye and i made a controller panel for the final proyect, XD we had to use a broken needle fro ma sewing machin to drill the holes cus the drimmmer was unavaileable. i still have the circuit somewhere
Is nobody going to talk about those high notes? Really impressive singing!
This is something ave and peg at zip ties and bias plies could use lol
this one is missing the gaymer chair, every youtuber has one. he already has the sound absorption thing in the back and the apple crap.
that falsetto is so impressive holy shit
When too much rage on call of duty  and you decided to make this.
A critique, if you don't mind, ElectroBOOM: it seems like you're overdoing the effects and stuff.  The show is starting to feel more like it's going in the direction of one of those old children's science shows.  It's not there yet, but I like the appeal it had before to us adults.  Know what I mean?  Does anyone else agree or have a clearer point of view?  "Less is more" I think is a good rule of thumb.  Commercials are good though.
Imagine her daughter came to give him coffee and listening the '#?!*ING button'
I really appreciate covering the mouth so we can't guess what the word is :D
hes needed that for years
The fact that he renovated his studio looks so cool now  Now please add a main banner that says  "ElectroBOOM: the man who can stand electricity"
b@#$&ing button
headphone warning anyone? xD
Bored with auto-beep,so downgrading to manual beep is more fun 😁
why would you make a fucking button?
An arduino by itself cant do a sine wave
Mehdi: [presses the button randomly]  Guy who knows morse wondering why he wants to swing a raccoon by its tail:  **confused noises**
2:56 made me curl my toes and wince
How do you wear that long-sleeve in the summer?
That advertising dance at the end. Loved it...
You know, if you go on thingiverse, there's probably hundreds of different acoustic chamber 3d files for speakers. That you can use to print out a speaker chamber. Probably not as cheap as the pill bottle, but would definitely provide a fuller sound, and need less calibration
The best way to explain electronic circuits....  ❤️❤️
"Dammit!  I guess it'll grow back."  - ElectroBOOM, 2021
Sometimes I forgot how f*beep*ing BRILLIANT you really are!
Thank you for spreading science in a fun and empirical way!
I like how Mehdi uses the same effect he uses back then, its like his unique style
Can we all just appreciate how masterfully he covers his mouth every time he *$#ps in introduction, so we can't make out the word
Did anyone else notice the pitch of the beep got higher towards the end of the video?
09:30, multitasking.
A big thanks to all your patreons for supporting you, so broke people like me can still learn something! :D
Nice new setup tho❤️
Linus uses one on the wan show
2:22 You been peeking in my window, you-
I was thinking you would be using a wien bridge
I was expecting a button that shocks you, inducing a swear.  I liked the improvised resonator testing, do you think it would be difficult to build a small adjustable diaphragm, like the ones found in cameras?  The integrator output (triangle wave) sounds good enough imo, I don't think the rc filter is needed.  cheers!
He made a telegraph
Shave and a haircut... 2 pence... lmaooo
Impressed by the Queen of the Night aria! 👏
Tuuut
Swearing with extra step
What a surprise ending! I was definitely expecting a 555.
Okay, i have heard enough *blipping sound* this year
Thought he was saying a fucking button
I love this dude. He's so funny. Been a fan since 2015
No one talked about new background ✨💙 oppppp
ET Phoning Home sounding
Every video is whew Mehdi at least has one more video proof of life. Thank you for the entertainment and knowledge
Ah yes. Morse device.
This was funny :)
man, this made my head hurt.. from the constant high frequency noise
いや最初からFワードを言わないようにすればいいんじゃないのｗ
I don't get bleeping at all. It's a very american thing, we don't really use it in Germany like on TV for instance. Either swear or don't, but this is just silly. Land of the free, eh? Yes, yes, I know Mehdi is canadian.
5:35 remember the BOOM t-shirt at the airport? XD
I am curious as to how many of those 'mistakes' are on purpose and how many are genuine mistakes.
Soo funny! 🤩🤩🤩
Mehdi Sings Mozart. I could sell tickets for that.
idk whats wrong with swearing  i mean where i live its a normal thing but when i see thinks like that in north america i have a little cultural shock about that
Can you make a high frequency Tesla coil, more like a plasm candle
Instructions unclear, accidentally built a &#!$ing synthesizer.
I don't know a @#$% thing! (Thats why I'm here.)
I accidentally learned a lot about how headphones work and how they get the frequencies to work, goes well along with Dank Pods videos, LOL
You should show us how to put sub woofers in a car and make them louder
To be fair, that was some quality singing.
So it's a 'Nut Button' but for rage?  Now introducing: *rage nut*
Mehdi just 3dprinted an oscilloscope
Be4 watching!!!! Go to 4:00 mark.
from 4:00 to 4:19 golden age of youtube. this is gonna to be a MEME mark my words <3 we love you bro.
I wonder why electroboom didn't choose an oscillator that produces a sine at the output like a wein-bridge or a phase shift oscillator ?
4:45 One of the golden rules of making "Yo momma" jokes
YouTube is full of dangerous content  Meanwhile YouTube:
Queen of the night over here
Great der holle rache impression.
I want a 3d printer and electronic things >:3
5:35 Mehdicine bottle
Okay now i want this to be a music chanel❤️😂😂
ey i got curiostiy stream cuz u said i should and it literalty is a steal its so cheap
4:02 I wonder how many takes it took to get this scene just right ? 😂😂
wonderful and necessary product 😁 ..btw, when will you make something on the Taz from the back? 😊
i needed this
Here I was expecting him to power it off of AC instead of tiny batteries.
nice honeycomb shape redecoration u made there. it is elegant
I knew I kept all my 1980-2010 airline headsets for a reason 😎
Mehdi can refute Dr. Lewin single handledy but can't code a single line in arduino, how can that be?
you have my like at 4:10 :D
Very nice background
I love how your hand always goes infront of your face just when the bleep happens.
Holy bleeb he actually hit those high notes in 4:02
Boom Boom machen diese 💢💣
You are 3d printing osciloscopes?  That would explaing why you give them for free xD
Innovation
Take a shot for every bleep in this video
You're amazing
This annoying sound also comes from many hospitals medi equipment and other electrical and electronic gadgets TV, radio etc primarily involving some electro magnetism.
I would rather just swear.
Medhi's editing is evolving for today's standards compare to his previous videos... Sweeeet
These videos: 98% planning 2% him getting electrocuted
It sounds like morse code
Morse code in 2021 ??
This is the content i subbed for and i *bleeping* love it
I was impressed by how well he had his hand directly between his mouth and the camera at every critical moment.
10:40 That is a swear where I live lol  It's used when you're driving an you want to insult another driver without shouting
Anyone else thought he meant something else..... 😂
No bleeping needed here, I resort to 'fsck' for all my computer issues; confuser issues.
Love the background
Is this how bleepers work? I would have thought this would be behind the mic
This video is incredible! I learned, and laughed a lot!
1:11 When I see what's happening today, It might become a reality. What a world we live in...
such a nice day cuz we have new video notification from ElectroBoom 👍🙏
Nice background :)
how to flex your irrelevant talent 4:02
now I know why my in-ear earphones are shaped the way they are. thanks mehdi :)
4:02 Mickey mouse doing some opera?
dude! you got some pipes there! ^_^
Most Accurate Caption on planet.
So he's making this button so he won't edit every swear in his videos
Dude that opera was damn near perfect 👌
Brings back memories of making my own portable speakers when i was a kid back when MP3 players came out.  With an old computer speaker wired to a 3.5mm penis and a Rockstar can as the Cavity.  Or sometimes when im in the shower I put my phone on speaker in the direction of a toilet paper roll.
When the circut went on fire it looked staged even though we all now that things like burning are normal for mehdi
Most Acoustically Pleasing Video Ever..
4:45 - That's what she said?
why restrict your reactions, is it funny to do so? I do not think so. Just say it, She'll be right!
Very interesting experiment
on the outro.. bang budabu bang... i expected you bleep it hard all the way. your work is much appreciated  :3
The worst thing about this video, is that ot ends.
disclamer: dont watch the video with headphones
I never go barefoot. If I take off my shoes, I put on my sandals. This has saved my toes so many times I am never going barefoot again. Except in the shower, where there are no table legs or bedposts to ruin my day.
So basically, an English button?
8:51 come on now... How...  Also, no polarity protection, you didn't have a single diode?
I really liked the opera
Make a diy electric vehicle, like a scooter or e bike
Mehdi, you know you don't have to keep getting actually hurt for this channel to continue being successful. Please take care of yourself
@4:40 started searching for mosquitoes around me :'()
Damn Mehdi, that was pretty decent singing.
>TFW you build a CW keyer that just outputs to a speaker instead of a transceiver
Mehdi acidently making the speaker of a morse line
17 seconds in and I can tell he's saying "bleep". Not a complaint, just an observation.
Looks $@!#*&% good but why not a 555 timer circuit? I think you are the ¤Ω*§, keep on $@!#*&%. Best $@!#*&% teacher ever.
Why not have it in line with the audio input, that way it can actually cut out your sound and insert one of its own, so you really can say anything
When I was a young boy, I went through a phase where I said "Frick/Freaking" before every other word. My aunt was a smartass and said: "We all know which word you actually mean, so why not just say it?". Thus began my cussing phase. My mom didn't let me see my aunt for a while after that.
Perhaps you could add a circuit to mute your microphone during the beep.
How will a 1kHz peak "block" a word when a word has a complex/unknown spectrum? The only way that it works is if you use a circuit to disconnect the mic and the 90Hz tone to be inputed in the mic line.
Pretty loud *EH* Thats when you know you have been living in Canada for a long time
hands free swearing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love the redesigned studio :)
Cooking👍🤣
this is first time i realized you DONT  want resonance in  audio speakers
Next he adds potentiometers and makes a synth next episode
Wow. . . new background. . . nice....👍
Whoa, that singing :0
Wow... New set?
مهندس کاش ی مدار تبدیل برق تکفاز به سه فاز میساختین☹️
I am a little bit confused, is it a "&$!#%" Button or a "&#!$%" Button, because I really need a "&#!$%" Button and do not want to build this amazing project and end up with a "&$!#%" Button which would be totally useless for my application.
Nice background!
Is tryangular-ish  a term of art. Lol!
Not to take away from this, but I was kinda hoping it would be a 1khz arc making the sound, like your musical Tesla coil :(
But can you make it auto bleep with word recognition?
Was that his real toe in that stubbing scene? Does he do his own stunts? We know he does. Bravery.
bleeping swearing has to be one of the most retarded things humanity has ever done... just say fuck for fucks sake, everyone hears it in their head anyway... pathetic. (i do not mean you specifically, i mean people in general...)
I think you missed your calling. Dr. Bose, I presume??
خوشت میاد بهت میگن مانکی مهدی. اصلا چی میگی.فراموش نکن این یک برنامه در مورد الکترونیک است
Nobody:  Everybody as soon as they get to controll a static sound: dendeledenden DEN DEN
8:48 if this wasnt staged he def wouldve dropped that osciloscope
The magic flute - Queen of the night aria, mmmm, as much as your taste in opera is commendable... Mozart will haunt you tonight.
wire it to an AI , and a mic, have the AI predict when you are gonna swear and do it for you
You're graying like a king, dont color it
Nice touch. Covering your mouth each time you say &#!$%ing
Waiting for a full Eurorack to do this..
Sooo when’s the next live stream..?
&#!$%ing love the transitions :p
HAHAHAHAH holy "beep" you actually hit your toe that hard
I would use an Arduino Pc to play a Beep.mp3. instead of your elaborate solution.
Why when I saw the censored word I immediately thought "aahh a fucking button"...
4:02 Is this really you? Or is this edited in some way? If yes, do you have singing experience? It's way better than expected!
Just me or this can be used to make some morse code?
Even though the singing seemed lip-synced, it sounded like his own voice. If that is the case, kudos.
Your best video ever, so funny. You might have also mentioned that your frequency generator output impedance (50 Ohms) was in series with the speaker and would have reduced the amplitude of the bleep. Your op amp output impedance is low  (maybe a few ohms) and so will produce a louder sound. The concept of resonance was well done and clearly illustrated.  Cheers Barry
5:36 you meant Mehdicine bottle right?
I definitely prefer the bleeping. Uncensored swearing gets old REAL fast and cheapens the delivery.
4:02
4:48 bit it also depends on audio frequency so for other frequency hole should be slightly different 😀
Wow, very cool background after These years!
I was feeling creative and industrious today, so I made a simple python program with some nice features like reading from a file and using functions. Then I wanted to put it on a webpage to let others benefit from it as well. And found out webpages are &#!$%ing stupid. Then I stopped trying to do real and useful things and laid down. I feel this channel is one of those that inspire you to realize that life sucks.  I was hoping the square wave was more like synth or instrument distorted sound, but it was not that far from the other sounds.
9:21 so no one’s going to talk about the hands multiplying
2:21 " ...you don't know electronic "  this Words feels so good  Because Because i also don't know coding much  😂😂
If you're worried about the battery polarity can't you just put some diodes in?
1:11 - that's exactly how regular canceling works, so button won't make things worse.
You're great
Word decoded by super computers  " The Fucking button "
You should patent this but to late, China is already mass producing the $%^%$^ button as we speak
i love the new background design anyway.!   can you do a fence shocker for home security.
Am I the only one who wants to see "ElectroBoom!" the opera?
Mozart would be proud
O c'mon why does curiositystream cost with your promotion coupon $14.99 and without it $11.99 ??? This promotion is &#!$%ing sh$#$!
// Learn to code; int buzzerPin = 9; int buttonPin = 7; const int toneFreq = 1000;   void setup() {   pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT);   pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT); }   void loop() {   int buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);   if (buttonState==LOW)   {     tone(buzzerPin, toneFreq);   }    else   {     noTone(buzzerPin);   } }
3:00 meme content
Every time I see Mehdi pull out an oscilloscope, I get "scope insecurity".
4:02 Reached a new peak! Holy crap that was amazing.
How many takes was the singing one?
Honestly though it's kinda stupid that you're not allowed to swear on YouTube I guess it's the children's fault ;/
4:38 I love your videos nd i respect but damn my dirty mind...
fajne tło byczq
OK, that acoustic chamber info is really useful.  Why did nobody tell me this decades ago?
funny thing is my son still hears me swear even when i press and hold the button.. So i guess it wont work in a live conversation.. bummer..
Sound effects button. Electric booms
02:22 - OH MY GOD! I need to get one of those 3D printers (left of screen)! Where can I buy one? Can it print me a spectrum analyser too? How long did it take to print out your oscilloscope? Thanks. :з
I need a good laugh. Push the button. Lol. The President has a bleep button.
You  just built a Morse Code practice oscillator.  Can also use a 555 as an astable multivibrator :)  Love your videos, you should take the Amateur Radio Exam, look forward to having a QSO!
Your new room arrangement looks awesome!
2:16 well if you work with an FPGA!
I'm still waiting for what stage of MCU 'Dr. ElectroBOOM' makes his appearance...
Dang, that background looking nice
Well, this video is going to get demonitized. YouTube thinks "beep" is a swear.
You are one of the best loons.
Resistors cannot ignite during overload
Mehdi, I appreciate the effort you went through to choreograph yourself on a way that you blocked your mouth when you were &#!$%ing.
hey man, I am one of your first 50k subscribers. I guess you started to run out of ideas ,it's sad to say this but your videos quality are getting worse day after day.
Hello.. can't you build motor air-cond to any Al's..n sory my English is bad.. From Malaysia 🤗🤗
In a meeting??...  Electrodes on the chairs!? >:3
Like🌹👉🌹👉🌹👉🌹👉🌹👉🌹👉🌹👉
I want one!
I would have just used the square wave from the schmitt trigger oscillator. it wouldn't make that much of a difference sound wise from such a tiny speaker.
oscillators are rad
Exquisite sleight of hand, sir
You eyebrow is offensive.
Just use voicemod
i dont know about you, but here in italy when we stub our toes we start a sequnce of really loud swear words to the point where we almost create a black hole
why not just use a Piezo beeper?
waw
An elecritians best friend , his stack of broken junk
finally a background which is the coolest thing since the last time he got shocked by anything
4:47 i thought my tinnitus was acting up
Your new room has a lot of reverb, better fill it with new dangerous inventions soon
2:26 that smile killed me 😭, nice video Mehdi
Well would you look at that. In the background Medhi 3d printed a scope!
when are we getting "ELECTROBOOM the MUSICAL"?
Your room looks oddly tidy these days 😄
Good song
I know how to program arduino sir, may be someday, we can collab and make a project on @stellarvk TW, love your videos.
8:46 Oh goddamit Its on fire
/*connect your speaker to pin 12 Connecticut your button to pin 13*/  int bottonks;  void setup(){ pinMode(buttonks, INPUT); } void loop(){ if(digitalRead(buttonks == HIGH)){ tone(12, 10000); } else{ digitalWrite(beep, LOW); } }
i knew this guy was clever but he 3d printed an oscilloscope !!
superimpose mechanical dc-to-ac generator signals
I dig the new office good work there ;]
I loved your rendition of Queen of the night. although you may be more suited to the part of Monostatos.
Great video, I love the  new layout behind you!
Nice shelves.
2:17 As a programmer I feel personally attacked
Actually it can be used to learn a morse code btw
That was a suberb Queen of the Night
I'm here for the sparks, fire and explosions. You never disappoint. 🤣🤣🤣
Nice set up!
"FUULLLLLLLLL BRIDGE RECTIFIER"
4:02 i want a 10 hours version of that
Don't you want to cut out the mic and replace it with the beep sou if you swear too loudly you can't hear it?
See my little speaker!
Try to make a magnetron
You're always telling everyone about your impotence.... unless you're talking about "impedance /ɪmˈpiːd(ə)ns/" Im PEEE dans
2:57 bro i felt that 😂 that looked painful even in acting
10:40 He couldn't resist the Shave and a Haircut.
8:27  yeah, for music production, flat headphones are usually recommended but most casual listeners prefer headphones to be a tad more bassy
The ringing noise in my ears 4:28
Im dead
Did you get a free oscilloscope yet??
Your new setup looks beautiful! Finally you organised it😂
It looks like some sort of 4th order bandpass enclosure. Sealed rear chamber and ported front chamber, but with no port length. The frequency response has a peak before and after 1KHz like a bandpass enclosure
took 8 minutes for a real failure in an electro boom video what a historic event
10:20 I can relate to that statement...
The American People are tired of Women
electroboom queen of the night cover was something I didn't know I was missing in my life till now
4:00 that was quice clean
damn you can sing
Then again, a real "bleep" button would inject that "bleep" directly into the electrical audio stream, not via a speaker and free air. Which makes most of this very pointless.
Cool project
Ha, jokes on my ears produce that sound by themselves.
I'm not sure if it's true, but I heard that the YT algorithm might treat the bleep the same as an actual swear...
Basically stream deck sensor button
9:03 You can hear him say S***
Brings back some memories: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p53PxLBQFAk
EPICO....
2:16 You write some code and suddenly you know electronics? you don't know a DAMN THING!  :( I thought we were friends... But I will forgive you cause I love the the sound effect from 5:15
Now you know whole size matters!
Who knew he could sing
How sad to see a science channel post such videos.  no 3d printer with print data.  no decibel recorder.  really a lot of garbage in this video
2:13 are farmers, bum badum bum bum bum bum
Pliz were seifti glove
i really like the office lab theme
I would love to buy that to just use while playing with friends
When are you making the video on the oscilloscope printer?
4:08 return to monke
Dont know why and how but electroboom reminds me of doc from back to the future
jokes on you I skipped to the result and learned nothing. Muahahah
آقا مهدی جان من یه زیر نویس فارسی بزار ما که انگلیسی بلد نیستیم بفهمیم 😭😭😭
Its not &#!$%ing its fucking😂
"Swearing Is Actually a Sign of More Intelligence - Not Less - Say Scientists"  just saying... it is wrong by yt keep people less intelligence because we would spend more on "Buy our bullsh*t" ads. Keep it up
The circuit is quite simple "If you're an electrical engineer"
You just made my terrible day better :) Thank you
What’s a pand? 😂
I learned a bit and laughed my *1kHz sine wave* off
There is no better way on earth, to learn something whilst trying not to burst into laughter, than watching ElectroBoom :D
The circuit is pure black magic to me but super cool.
Nice! It's just A LITTLE off tune (30 cents above C6 instead of B5)
"The main reason for the weakness..." is you need to prevent ( or delay) the pressure wave created at the front,  from combining with the opposite pressure wave created at the back, and canceling out. (I assume the speaker was open back) In your case you closed off both sides (see band pass box) and the size and length of hole/vent can be tuned to make a particular frequency efficient.
I watched this in order to know what is that &#!$%ing Button, I was wondering, but it's actually not a #!$%ing Button, it's a bleeping button, lol
New word: akoustik
Awesome
Does programming a PLD count?
I wonder how many tries it took to get that operatic take without any nearby capacitors exploding.....
Wow! Nice background! I hope its real and not a green screen.
u take for ever to make videos we need u to feed us some electronics we r hungry just make videos as quick as possible we still waiting for the next one  u r the best
Medhi actually sang the exact right notes but put the wrong section of the accompaniment!
Is nobody gonna talk about that toe stub? Looks like that table too more damage than him
Another reason why the sound is weak when connected to the scope, is that the output cannot supply enough current for such a low impedance load.
I really like your videos but please stop injuring yourself for likes and subscriptions.
Now do one that makes the SpongeBob noises when they are saying bad words
this is how I would do that: connect button to power, connect -(negative) buzzer to power gnd and + (positive) buzzer to button.
4:03 Mozart's "Queen of the night aria" from the play "The magic flute"...badly done.  :/
Let's take a minute to appreciate the singing
when he started singing my dog came up to the TV and stared intensely
OperaBOOM!
New studio background looks great!
Hey Mehdi - where did you get those hexagonal wall treatments from? Amazon? Affiliate link? Pweeeease? 😁 oh and .. GIMME DA MEETA ! Have an awesome day
Man you inspired me so much that this year I'm going to college for electrical engineering and automatization, than you so much Mehdi.
Referring to the Arduino... you and me both brother!! Lol.  🤣
5:16 *When my brain is stressed out.*
11:02 YES!! PLEASE!!!
TIL breadboards can catch fire
You can even send Morse code in an audible range
2:00  555 timer IC.
I like how unstable the frequency generator is.
That hand resonator was a dope demonstration
Ok now we need nword button
You taught Linus how to transfer into a Segway
Budaludaludaludaludaluda
10:36 *...sad but trueeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee*
I feel sorry for Whoever had to censor this video
Man got a new setup
Mehdicine Bottle?
couldn't you make it even simpler using a phase shift oscillator?
4:02 I'm genuinely impressed by that performance. So impressed that I had to watch it three times.  Please tell me it wasn't edited in from another source.
4:02 That was a very very good opera thing.
It sounds.
Legit thumbed up for the vocal solo
WHO THE *BEEP* DO YOU THINK YOU ARE!?
Fucking smart ,God damn you Most intelligence jokes👍❤
Why Are Americans generally triggered when someone say fuck, what the fuck is the actually problem with that?
This was kinda useful for my speaker project
in Italy when we stuck our toes we say "PORCO DIO" and not "iiiii"
That intro was really offensive
Can we please, PLEASE, get a Electroboom X Michael Reeves collab? Let´s see how much damage we can do.
Doesnt program audrinos but does opera🤷‍♂️
Man really hit his toe just for one bit in his video
Lemme see if curiousity stream is available on my smart tv... oh it is.
1:10 Just watch the "The Count Censored" video if you want to know what it feels like watching an innocent video being bleeped all over. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-Wd-Q3F8KM
this was a physically painful experience:  my ear almost bleed lul
That background is looking dope👌🏻👌🏻
4:03 man I just got a ringtone now. Gonna set this as alarm too, the most motivating audio ever to wake up.😂😂
"Mehdi working with Arduino"  Future video for the Mehditation channel, Mehdi? :)
Mehdi, what the bleep ..
Instructions unclear when I press mine it just electrocutes me
Did he just intentionally stub his toe!? Does he not feel pain????
Thumbs up to start, for great expectations.  Singing: thumbs down, punch  big hole in bottom of pill bottle: thumbs up, circuit design: thumbs down. (too complicated) stub toe: thumbs up. Blows up circuit: thumbs up. OK, total thumbs up exceeded thumbs down. YAY!
Can you send me the STL file for that oscilloscope? lol
****ing morse code
WOW, that backgroud is amazin
did you especially find a documentary on history of electricity or did the curiosity guys who paid you find it for you? be honest.
1:36 Hitler
Medhi: engineer, youtuber, singer
Electro boom: Stubs toe Electro boom:reeeeee
best teacher ever
We use that op amp oscillator circuit a lot in guitar pedals. Specifically modulation pedals like choruses, flangers, phasers, and tremolos.
I was hoping you'd actually build the circuit out of a transistor and capacitors from your junk stash. Instead of the Chad Single Transistor Phase-Shift Oscillator we got the Virgin Schmitt Trigger Oscillator.
New background looks fresh
Next project: OnlyFans featuring your hands.
“You write some code and suddenly you know electronics, you don’t know a damn thing” *Laughs in computer engineer*
What a good idea lol
Never understood the need to bleeping... cursing is part of the natural language, doesn't mean use it all the time but using it once in a while appropriately.  And children hearing it is not an excuse they know every single word by the time they finish kinder garden anyway, most probably way earlier.
8:48  electroBOOM: good bord The bord : lets destruction the video and flame the home
The noise foam on the wall is placed randomly, that needs some rectifying.
Strongly agree on preferring not to use Arduino for basic projects. In the same grain Mehdi, can you do a video on making an RC car? Or just simple RC circuits in general? So far I've only been able to find Arduino projects (which are good for better control and features, but more complex than I need for simple things), and I'd love to see a proper example of a straightforward circuit without the need for programming or unnecessary computer boards taking up project space. Plus, the inevitable destruction you'd wreak with an RC robot would be a lot of fun to watch.
Censorship is ALWAYS EVIL and ALWAYS gets downvoted.
Gimme some stuff
Yes just what i needed in online class
But but but.... i use Audacity, generate a sound, use Voicemeeter Potato +  Macro buttons, and play the sound on a press of a key.... 5 min of free work.... Must be why im poor 😥 should build screaming buttons, and sell them.
👍❤️👍
Boring
if someone gets offended by whatever they fill the beeps with, that's their own fault, they offended themselves.
NOOO DISLIKE😠😠 👎👎💔💔 YESS LİKE 👍👍😃😃
wow!!    you were in tune and everything...what a voice...!
New potential: Morse's code
No but seriously all that arduino stuff starts getting annoying when you want to learn how to build a circuit to do something and the only people with advice online talk about using a microcontroller. I am not here to cheat! If I need a microcontroller to do something for me then I don't understand the thing it's doing for me well enough yet!
"Can I show you how your cavity hole size changes the resonance with my driver frequency" is gonna be my pick up line from now on
Wow ElectroBoom didn't do too bad with that part where he tried to sing Opera. The song is-Der Hölle Rache, done best by Mimi Coertse in my opinion
“Freaking” button.
Dude me questioning how you still alive with these eletric things
Pls make a video about radioactivity.
I think you just made a Morse code wireless telegraph...
How to get sine wave from Arduino uno ?
Maaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnn! First i was a bit disappointed that he didn't fked up dis time but he didn't disappointed me he put his board on fire
4:10 legit a monkey
@ElectroBOOM 8:44 Always double check your connections!!! LOL
Ahhh what do you do for deaf people who lip read? You need to HAVE BIGG BIGG BOOM so everyone in WORLD HEAR *¥^€§^!!! 😂😂😂
I always thought that Mehdi made the 1khz sine wave himself with his own mouth!
Shouldn't the hole be most effective for half wavelength? It can also be used for Morse telecommunicating training too. Lol
Only just got your notification about this video 3 hours late
Nice Channel... i Like the &#!$%ing plant in the background... :D
10:20 Timestamp for myself
He is like a child playing with fire
9:33 mehdi flexing his editing skills
Voice of an angel
nice background Bro
where is the new Tesla white board ?
That's actually a parabolic shape which then over both cycles appears to be a sine wave. This is because integration of square yields parabolic.
for 8 minuts i was wondering where is boom !!!
4:40 min. I need more hairs...............:-)
8:43 Boom!!! 😂😂😂
Curiosity Stream brought us Mozart too!
Hahaha so funny
What a invention 😂
Respect for Mehdis recration of stabbing your toe on a side of something
Your Background looks really cool!
comment on this comment in 10 years and you'll win
4:10 return to monke
Which button is he talking about
God I love Mehdis angry fire sound effect...
You are getting lazy
You don't need that button, YouTube censorship will do it for you!
nerver gets old... LOL
2:59 best part of the video
Mehdi: Damnit I guess it'll heal back Me: SWEET SKATEBOARD JESUS. WHY.
2:16 I totally agree with you. Using arduino is the easiest way to go, but if you want to learn electronics, just use discrete components and chips. Writing a code or even worse, copying it, won't teach you anything, exept some programming and soldering stuff
Guys,   do I need any Mehdi-cal attention if I swear constantly?
Gotta love how Mehdi put it in the sound of shave and a haircut at 10:40
The pitch was a little high, but cool!
This is the same thing as with the "n-word". You censor yourself but everybody knows what you mean anyway, so wtf is even the point of the self-censorship? Words don't have intrinsic meaning; the meaning is in the intention of the speaker. American (and Canadian) culture is so weird...
9:14 But but but... that was 1.06 kHz! Literally unusable. /s
this video has the most beeping out of all his videos
Looked like some rubbing alcohol to make a flame?
Anyone in earshot probably thought Mehdi was making a telegraph machine
5:44 The balkan D.I.Y finishing steps.
7:18 looks like my crypto portfolio over the last month
Shall we take a moment to appreciate that Mehdi from the future builds a time machine in one of his videos, and goes back in time to tell his younger self to "get his life in order," in other words start this channel.
Why can't i hear anything....or in this video there is no audio?
Love the Mozart
I can see that you just printed an Oscilloscope, can you please share this model with us?
Hurting is back. GOOOD
I got voltage too low message when i loaded the video.
congrats on realizing that the specific words used are usually not the part that makes speech offensive, just the part that makes the offense most obvious. If you were saying something that could get you cancelled, bleeping out the specific word won't make it better. If you are saying something that is so similar to bigoted speech that mishearing one word makes it indistinguishable, consider doing a better job communicating with your audience.
You could time the presses to give messages in Morse code (sound).
Doubles as a morse code transmitter.
Swearing is actually very healthy, there is no reason not doing it, so just go for it
This episode: Mehdi makes a synthesizer. "For music?"  "For swearing."
Nice background bro
Very cool!
Ritchard Burnish; way ahead of you friend!
4:15, just casually singing one of the world's hardest operas
Is it possible for you to build a device that will nullify sound and make it so when people are speaking they can't be heard?
4:00 Mehdi going back to monke. That was way better singing than i would've imagined to be honest.
In my country, people think that Canadians are calm. but this how they all hide their anger by making a "&#!$%ing Button"
I didn't realize you became Vitas...
Eyy the studio and the background is looking good
He's  saying bleeping  Edit: oh... He revealed that early in the vid... 😅
This idea is from the live 😂😂😂😂
You bastard! (oops foot missed the button) I can't find that Jim Al khalili documentary on curiosity stream!!
i like the new studio
It sound like a Morse Code BLEEP!!
i like the new background
waiting for 5 million special video
He always reminds me of Doofenshmirtz
4:18 CLAP CLAP THAT WAS GOOD
This man is a meme hahaha!
Hey guys! Sorry to ask, but, in one of his videos, he was talking about a software to simulate electronic circuits in and use a digital oscilloscope in it. I can't find the video! Does anyone of y'all remember what was the name of the software
Jokes on you, i already use CuriosityStream.
4:01 Medhi’s wife is like, “what’s he up to now?!”
No giveaway this time ??? I just wanted a multi meter 🥺
بابا ترو خدا ایرانم سر بزن😶😶
The circuit is simple if your an electrical engineer and don't burn your house down or completely disable yourself building it
15 dollara is what I earn 3h working hard you &€@?
Copper plate generator pleeeeeaaaaaase. They made it in Doctor Stone and I really want to see it done here.
This bleeper could also work as Morse code...what do ya think about that ?
So glad I decided on Mechanical Engineering. Every time you bring up the whiteboard with your circuit diagrams I thank my lucky stars that I somehow passed my circuit theory class and don't have to go into any more complex circuits. WAAAAYYY over my head! haha
New studio let's go ❤❤❤
Im still waiting waiting for the day that he uses his 3d printer
I just love this Youtuber, He's just my favorite one. : )
An oscillator project without a 555.... What a bleep of bleep-ing oscillator is without a bleep-ing 555
Wait what you got a clean background i think you are not you but you who belong to parallel universe bring back our one who is you
In the beginning  I thought you will make an active noise canceling device :D
Please tell me you're joking about not knowinng Arduino. It's so easy. Just watch some YouTube videos on it. My first program from scratch took me an hour and I suck at languages. You SHOULD do something with it on your channel so many will learn how easy it is, and combined with electrical knowledge, amazng.
If you want to I'll teach you the basics and a bit more of ARDUINO. Yust answer to this and we will find a way.
Getting cancelled for ████ing sounds amazingly ████ing hilarious and is now my new life goal. Shoutouts to my fellow ████ers!
You probably need VENTILATION!!
I love how in every video that Mehdi makes always had a somehow fucking accident
I need this. How much to buy one from you?
And I thought you said f-ing button
I find I'm stubbing my toe less, and opening the door onto my little toe more. My world is pain.
8:50 , just casually turn on the thing (3 seconds later) "oh shit"
It can also be used as a simple morse code transmitter
comment for algorythm
YO! That Background Is Sick THO!
this is actually an incredibly good video and I didn't expect to learn so much from something so simple lol
What a weird coincidence, I was wondering how to make my own button yesterday.
8:56 what to say🤣 10:37 ohh no Bleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
We should be doing those experiments more in schools and show this stuff to kids so they learn it at a young age. I feel like most people dont know how electricity works these days as a result of doing these demos less in school. Wouldn't hurt if more people had better foundations for learning :D.
4:10 monke noises intensifies
Does anybody know a good affordable power supply. I need a small one for arduino and electronics
Epic censoring
I see youre upgrading your workstation huh BTW thanks for the 101 series, Mehdi! It helped me a bit for a test I'll have tomorrow. So thank you man
Except I like the bleep from the 80s & early 90s better
nice work to hide you mouth every "beep"  8:42 8:50 I didn't understand How you did it  ... reversed polarity for the first one ?
Been waiting for it a long time
Woooot
I'm sorry that I laughed at 8:51! 😅🤣
oh beeping... lololololol
This guy stubbed his toe for the vid, mad respect
F I R E  C R E A T E S  P L A S M A
I think you need a raspberry pi
Juicy YouTube Money 🤤
can't say how much happiness ur videos brings with itself , I wonder how much work is done before the final video get released (I am sure tons of works are done), love u Mehdi❤️(my fav youtuber)..🤗
Hi you can make silent room
will you accept my friend request on facebook?
idk, bleeping never gives me the same satisfaction as actually swearing, I think swear words legitimately have a place in language and shouldn't be taken out, takes away from the overall experience, but I understand why people bleep themselves on yt, but I think yt is in the wrong to penalize it.
You could just have brought a buzzer
ROFLMAO I always love your video's!! <3 <3 <3
Let the button swear
Over 150.000 views after 2 hours... Thats kinda cool. Even more than videos with free energie device
What's this nonsense? No one even got electrocuted.
This is retarted. Next what ? A muzzle to censor and apply political corectness to your speech.
Just make it shock you when you scream to loud
Did you 3d print a oscilloscope? Pls send file..
or... we can just accept the fact that swearing is a thing people do.
WoW I loved the background 🤩
So i just a morse code thing/machine with different face
i like your new background
Oh Thank god
Wth
yes
Starting to think he enjoys the pain 😈
Deja Vu
at this point of history, tbh the bleep is same as ****, whenever i hear it, i hear ****
"Curiosity stream is available worldwide..."  *laughs in China and North Korea that would censor everything on it*
setup looks great!
4:11 monke sounds
I feel personally attacked at 2:16
Nice background😊
The bleep? I haven't watched this video yet?
Finally the $%*^+ button
5:15 If The Price Is Right ever brings back Penny Ante, they should use that sound effect.
Curiosity stream is also on tivo premiere
The piano master is getting so good!!
Your background is looking cool UwU
How to make screen
Mehdi Mozart :-)
He hides his mouth when he's says bleep
This video gave me a headache
A sponser while you used 'garbage'.  Ok
We need more hands! (9:40)
I can still hear the bleep after the video ends
4:14 you should be a signer
Was this "stubbing the toe" part supposed to be realistic? When this happens to me, usually the whole neighborhood gets to know what just happened. ;)
Nice background
How the whole thing set onf Fire xDDD Wonderful :D
عالی بود
Fun fact: you have never heard him swear
EloktroBoom: The Circuit is pretty simple.  Shows Einstein shit.
10:40 can someone tell me what song/melody this is from?
Wouldn't it work better if you send a 1kHz signal over the mic cable rather than using a speaker? The speaker may be loud, but it's never going to completely drown out what you're saying.
Not sure for other phones but on my samsung s7 bleeping sounds are allways way to load and annoying. sandly way too many videos on youtube contain it
Every time Mehdi picks up the drill I'm having a little heart attack
I made one to emit18kHz to annoy nearby kids and dogs with a 555.  Much more fun.
This man really sacrificed his own pinky toe for content.
why does he look younger in this video?
دکور جدید مبارکه دااش
Why inject the beep in reality when you can inject it in the audio of the already recorded video? Still good video👍
What
When did you learn how to sing like an Opera on 4:01?
He sings better than the actual orchestra.
Electroboom Jr is getting quite good on the piano
full bridge rectifier  is better
Doubles as a straight key for Morse code
ElectroBoom: It is working perfectly!  Me: Impossible.
I don't even remember when was the last time I use the Schmitt trigger oscillator
Really liking the new background I hope there's about it in Mehditation
I just want to sleep...and I saw the notification and my sleepiness is gone.. Thankss Mehdi!
Mehdi-sins bottle.
Bleeping Button
Your the best YouTube
2:57 lol
Electro  : circuit is quite simple....  AND  the circuit :
So we can 3d print scopes now
2:55 to 3:01 at 0.25 speed ^^ même and nightmares fuel ^^
you should become a part of nebula, a partner of curiosity stream
Ahhh yes this is a Music Teacher that I want.
This is just a way for him to monetize children.
My parents questioned what I was watching and I had to explain
Arduino is **** and **** and it for morons.. Arduino මහ ලබ්බක්
عالی فقط اونجا ک بوق عروس کشی میزنه 😂
This man is a legend and his a boomer.  So u guys should learn from him boomers
I watch electroboom and michael reeves (both brilliant) and its such a big contrast in their content.
9:44 I love that the ElectroBOOM crew are getting more screen time nowdays <3
Hahahahaha fun video
3:58 opera time
my use: OH YOU FUCKING -BLEEP-
Nice to hear ElectroCUTE improving her piano skills
we have those in turkey but only in live shows
4:00 King of the Night Lol
Mehdi, if you’re looking for video ideas, building a high power H bridge could be interesting! I’m trying to build one based on an arduino but I’m not exactly sure how to get the 5v logic level to fully switch on the high power mosfets. Would I need to use a mosfet driver or could I use a transistor on the gate of the mosfet? Any help would be greatly appreciated, I just graduated high school so I’m still going off of knowledge from YouTube videos :)
4:03 rejecte humanity, become monkey
Arduino takes minutes to understand you should try
I zoned out and Mehdi was singing opera what the heck
Edith Piof had nothing over you regarding electronic, Mehdi.
I can absolutely say that I have no idea what's going to happen when I play one of E.B.'s videos.
4:04 That was impressive
Nice  #$%&ing video
excellent as always!
Nice way of soldering
We can do electronics: casually burns the breadboard.
9:18 that Hits hard .. because I'm a electrical engineering student 😂 ...🙏
2:16 Reminds of a couple former classmates I had in a Programming course who were electricians
Only one piece fans know that face
When he stubbed his toe, I actually felt the pain through the screen...
Oh Finally I can play Xbox peacefully with this Button
How neat and clean was your background!
You could have made a simple wein bridge oscillator instead
Need full song... someone remix pls
You can also use it for morse code!
Thanks for the ringing in my ears... lol that sound on my headset was aweful!
I love when he posts
"Fcking button"
Your singing surprised me a lot haha
well like it or not, the future is arduino,it becames much more popular and become capable  of doing complex things with it's sensors, without electronic knowledge it's not efficient for sure but in the future i believe it will not need so much electronic knowledge because everything became automatic. When i started to work with computers we were setting jumpers for cpu on the mainboard before we power-up the pc, now it's just plug and play, electronics will be the same.
Why not do it on 555 instead of amplifiers?
Why filter a triangle? Why not make like a wien bridge oscilator or phase shift oscilator for sines directly
are you using 555 timer ic????
Nice falsetto
Someone is gonna clip that
New notification sound 5:15
0:58, LOL, we can actually hear the sound of the B and P at the beginning and the end of the word, even with the bleep sound, so he literally said HOLY BLEEP!
I made myself a diy bluetooth speaker with an mh-38 module and 2 3w 4ohm speakers i got from the flea market. I just left them uncovered and added a relief hole on tge back and was wondering why it had a horrible frequency response. Thanks to you i now know!! This was really helpful
Now just use a 3PST momentary switch and use the other poles to break your mic signal from the camera or computer. Or… loop the sine wave back into the microphone output signal and use it on your zoom meeting. Every time you want to use a delicious swear word, it cuts your mic, bleeps you, and returns when you release the switch.
He turns, and it burns...🤣
How can I test this without expensive oscilloscope any alternative?
Your new room looks AWESOME, Mehdi! Nice work!
Farsi beharf 1 bar😂
Mehdi does things 10x more complicated than programming and Arduino....
4:05 hi Mickie
Show desk
0:52 Convey your feelings by pressing the HOLY *beep button!! 😂😂
عالی بود  thanks
Mehdi, how about Sonoluminescence??? 👌😊
your content is getting poorer and poorer...
New acustic good ❤🧡💛💚💙💜  Thank you gor look at this coment longer than 1 second.
2:57
I love how every time in the intro he covered his mouth to censor it
bionic commando rearmed.
Why you never use 555 timer to make frequency. It's easier.
TIL: the censoring sound is a 1KHz sine wave
Him covering his mouth conveniently whenever he says beeping button 😂
Nice!
omg he finally posted the last time he posted was one week ago that was so long
ElectroSING when?
Hi, love your videos, but you shouldn't put your oscilloscope on your 3d printers bed because it can damage the springs or alter your bed levelling
y = cos(2*pi*1000*t), 0 < t < inf
Why do you not sell any good solder kit projects? I have learned so much from doing so many. Answered questions I didn't know needed an answer or existed. There are loads of good kits but even more junk and scams. They don't have to be expensive or useless trinkets. I'm still using the metal detector hand wand I built myself 5 years ago. What would be a good addition to make the project yours is instructions on how to modify designs to do more or something different or last longer.
The background is really cool🔥
The set looks good.
Always u're the best !
Hearing Mehdi sing was good enough for me
9:07 Lizards detaching their tails to escape predators:
This video was actually good , unconventional but good !
I expected some shocks
Showing my students the different wave types I found out that sawtooth waves are much louder and can be easily heard at frequencies that sinusoidal waves can not. I can immagine that the sinusoidal waves that are part of the sawtooth are more easily heard that the others wich would make the sound hearable. But should the energy to oscilate the speaker considered to be constant, would a sawtooth wave be louder than a sine wave? If that's correct, shouldn't you build the button with a sawtooth beep?
A 3D printed oscilloscope in the background?
Awesome job with the falsetto
classic ElectroBOOM
I'm a mechanical engineer so the circuit is not obvious for me. But I really wanted to learn how it works. Please tell me Mehdi
Where can i buy?
vishwa jit
yeah but it's a semitone too high
...tuuuut .....tuuuut......tuuuut. sound causes 😆😆
China be like: Gimme a million of those
Did no one notice that in the background there is a 3D printed an oscilloscope?
That was impressive!! Ya'll know what I am talking about <3
If you ask me to do this, I would just smack together a battery, a small buzzer with a button and sprinkle some wires
I can -ing talk
I love the new background.
Ur new back ground looks good
Mehdi, I’d recommend that you try learning Arduino! It’s literally plug and chug once you download the program, and there’s a ton of documentation and a lot of examples you can work off of. It unlocks so much potential for new projects and often makes them much more efficient to develop. For instance, Arduino has examples that play a tone on a speaker using just 10-20 lines of code, and adding button functionality could for sure be added in ~5 lines.
Ahh, I always end up learning something, damn u mehdi!
Hearing Mehdi sing Der Zaubenflote is something I dunno I needed until now.
I love your videos but plz upload once in 2 week  Do some work man  U are adorable your editing skills are assom man  The sound effect the video effect and narration are to the roof man  Kep it up
RIP this videos adsense
Sir this is a Wendy's
DAM Mehdi is a natural singer
Drink every time he $#@!%🍺
The guy who know morse be like: 👁 👄 👁
Love the background!
Feeling first with 69 others
I have no idea what’s he talking about but it’s still interesting to watch 😂😂
Why is your and technology connections uploads always in synch? Like almost every upload is in synch lol
Boom
"You write some code and you know electronics? You don't know a damn thing"  At last a reply to the kids acting tough with Arduino thinking they have a PHD in electronics
Why not just a classic NE555 as an astable Multivibrator and a piezo Buzzer? those things beep like hell 😅
I honestly was expecting a button that electrocutes you in a way that tricks you into pooping😂.  I guess this one is more useful than that
Until I saw one of those scopes turned on, I thought I stumbled onto Hans Beekhuyzen’s channel 🤣
Aah... yes the ¡Q%*$#? button, defenitly need one of those
He always covers his mouth with his hand while Censorship. So genius.
Please make a handheld high voltage ac power supply without flyback transformer Cause finding flyback transformer are difficult to find in India  Please make one i will subscribe from all the accounts from my home and all my friends though most of them are subscribed to you when u agreed to make a wand but some are left so please make one
You cheated by using opamps - the real electroboom would have used transistors !
Oh heyyy you said you will make one in your Stream i was there
Love the new setup
4:06 the most beautiful *bleep* I've ever seen
Nice baradar👌
I really liked your new background setup sir! I also wish I ll have like that one day
Yes! A FUCKING BUTTON.
What a missed opportunity for a FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER!
gay a f
4:02 He sounds like mickey mouse tho
Your hand motions blocking your mouth as you say the swears is gold.
عالی بود 😂
ive subscribed on all 10 of my alts
"The circuit is simple" proceeds to show me the most complex circuit I've ever seen
This is fantastic, but I think the finishing touch to make it perfect would be a large red emergency stop style dome switch.
Yes , I love beeping , how did you know?
Okay, You're right, I did learn a lot more than I was expecting.
Respectable singing short ;)
8:08 Highschoolers in the bathroom be like
I work in radio and the FCC fines are quite heavy. It's no delay but maybe a use
8:43 and 8:50 Ah yess, the REAL ElectroBOOM is in town
10:40 that sound, in México, is used to insult
The world needs an Electroboom sings opera channel.
Ey, im looking for a new dad :3
Great when he dose anything wrong he can press it :)
He's off his med's again, NURSE!!  I agree though, Arduino is killing electronics. It's just plugging in boards and writing software.
Lovely how he includes his daughter's piano play     Prolly
I thought of the tittle that there's going to be some naughty stuff 😳 lol
U r  legendary
Interviewer: so what inspired you to create this f#^#^^#&ing button.   Electroboom: well my wife....
A fucking button
Electroboom sudenly sing opera
This man's home just got a glowup
Hi mehdi can you make a video about electro plating?
He hit those notes like the Queen
خارمادر لهجه فارسی😂❤
Soo... have you heard of those 5 cent buzzers that loudly beep at you if you just apply 5Vdc directly with no circuitry and no resonant cavity added on?
2:59 that's a new meme
Yay sound effects @5:15 made my morning ^_^
You can beep using morse code to swear
I loved the Setup Mehdi!! 😎
エレクトロ ボム頼むから自分の家で火事だけは起こさないでくれ🔥
The background looks sick! Your videos now look really professional, and not just a white wall
That sound chamber concept is pretty logical, but then why most speaker that we buy have diaphrams in nearly front of them and a wooden chamber at back?
I miss the old background
I like your new room setup Mehdi.
At the end ,during Curiosity stream's ad, Jim Al Khalili uses the original DC motor invented by Faraday ( currently stored at Royal Institution). One of the most important machines ever made
Wow! Just one video and you instantly rose to my #1 favorite opera singer! Congrats!
I don't know why but the line "I still don't know how to program Arduino" hit me hard as in one of his old video he said " I will learn how to program Arduino as it is easy" during a sponsor message (JK I LOKE THE WAY HE MAKES THE VIDEOS )
:O
Can you make a button that can make stench dissapear?
Hello mister Mehdi. Thank you for a new video.
so idk about you but YouTube still can recognize the bleep as a swear and will mark it
Wow i thinks
He got us in the first half, not gonna lie
Ladies and gentlemen, I think we just found our new ringtone!
As soon as this guy learns to program arduino, the world is over
Can ypu do daily upload
Now we know what he uses to BEEP whenever he gets electrocuted 😂😂
All he needs to do now is to pipe that 1kHz into OBS for his live streams.
You will be amaized, but  fully mechanical beeper is already purchasable - gas baloon with button and air horn.  noone ever hear what You said behind  beep!
Great idea !
I would use an Arduino for this using off the shelf components and a simple 5-minute piece of code, much easier! Still this version is definitely more interesting.
Wait i learnd ton of think of bleaping machine whaaaat?????
ooo love the new look of your shop
10:20. Oh I see. Someone got his hands on Old Tony's time shaping lathe.
"Blip" is being associated with swearing so much, that I think in the future, the word "blip" will be considered a swear word on itself.
How about you use CuriosityStream to learn "Arduino"?
* school siren goes off*  The autistic kid :. 4:12
sir how are you big fan of you learn Arduino and make videos on it as well
I want one hahahaha
2:59 can sense the memes that can be made out of this
ElectroBOOM and Technology Connections uploading the same day? Is this my birthday?
I &#!$%ing love you.
What if the censored beep was a fart noise instead of a beep noise 🤔😋😋😋😋
looks like u upgraded ur room  nice
the background in now gorgeous
Revolutionary idea.
@ElectroBOOM you created a 4th order band pass with the medicine bottle and cap
Lulzbot Tax Pro? I am so sorry, my condolences.
How the hell have you not burned your house to the ground??
Hey Mehdi! You could use your microphone on/off button instead of the beep button you made and you can mute out that part of your speach, or learn yoga and relax! :)
10:21  Once someone told me: "You wake the fuck up tomorrow, get your ugly ass together and finish what you started. Or I'll slap the shit out of you."  And I told him: "Who the fuck you think you're, trying to dictate my fucking life?" And he said: *"I'M YOU?!"*   **BLEEPING INTENSIFIES**
fckng button 🤣
nice background!!
&$!#% is actually b l e e p 😂
Dude you gotta try to be less careful. 😁😁🙏🙏
4:12  when you realize that you forgot turn off soldering iron when you are in holidays in Asia
I don't sleep untill he comments
$#!+ this video was £#(×=θ up!
That's pretty impressive that you can 3d print an oscilloscope. Looks great!
ElectroBOOM: Making a &#!$%ing Button  X-box Live 10 year olds: Pathetic
Are you going to do a project to remotly activate or desactivate your smoke detector ?  Because you should.
the old camera angle in my opinion was better 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Mehdi dont smoke pot, he smokes resistors.
Add a diode...  Reverse polarity protection. :P No really though, this reminds me of the old speakers I made in high school, muller rice pots are amazing for speakers!
I know realize there is an alternative universe where Mehdi has a singing channel called "VocalBOOM".
Just one sentence, you are amazing...
its impressive that u even edit ur vids, great work man! "thanks for whatching"... thank YOU for posting it
Ahhh the sound of avoiding demonetization  Beautiful
During the intro, you somehow managed to cover your mouth everytime you "bleeped" I was trying to read your lips to see what you were saying but your hand waved around and covered your mouth in a natural way almost every single time. This was either a coincidence (in which case odds are astronomical), or done on purpose (which would be very impressive making it look so natural). Either way, its worth pointing out.
Cancelled for making noises
"we do Electronics" love it.
4:02 blew my mind. Electroboom is truly a man of MANY TALENTS! 😂
10:20 using the beep to censor the swears while using the hand movements to censor his mouth was pretty clean
"Foool bridge Rectifiyaaahhh"
Nice
I don’t need a button to hear a bleep, I already have tinnitus
You must have heard for surge protection to save your house, this is swear protection to save your channel.
Mehdi pls check out Veritasiums last video free energy wind car
2:59 my toe hurts
I very much enjoyed the video, but wouldn't it be a better solution to rather make a rudimentary mixer with op amps to tie directly into the microphone circuit (assuming that you aren't using a digital interface)? Then you would also be able to use a potentiometer to adjust the levels rather than aiming it towards the microphone and relying on "open air coupling"?
Hi today I'm going to make a fu**ing Button that's what I was hearing all the time 🤣
8:51 The electric fire plate, destroyer of devices
Yo u know Arduino  ok how about the 3 main languages used to make a web page , HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
Me: Haha [SoundBeep, 1000, 500] go brrrr
8:31 Not Family friendly
Okay, learned a lot, but would still use Attiny25 :)
After Linus this is the best sponser segway.
dude... you know better than to drill towards your hand 0_0
Nice new background!
Mehdi new office setup? Nice
That stubbed toe looked too real.
Is this the reason they call it Volume?
Now connect it to an AI that is trained to listen to swear words and automatically beeps when it hears you say one.
I want to hear the sounds of the different waves in the circuit (square wave vs. saw tooth wave vs. low amplitude sine wave vs. final sine wave)!
Mehdi as queen of the night 👌 would watch that opera
Another day, another project without ever using a 555.
Hey
Is nobody else gonna talk about how we got an opera performance? How is this video free??
guess it will grow back
FULL BRIDGE RECTI(*BLEEP*)ER
Doujin writers: 6:28
👏
I bleep you all, best regards.
OMG... Your set looks so... clean 👍👍👍      Then pulls out stash 🤦‍♂️
I like how his whole desk catches on fire and he just blows it 😂
The Terminator Mehdi......🔥
The tone of the final product (with the circuit) actually sounds half a tone higher, but it does the trick :D
Lotsa censoring was put in this video.
Electroboom should try opera
i play 3 seconds audio on my Arduino using PWM library
YOUTUBERS HATE HIM! LEARN THIS ONE TRICK THAT MAKES YOU FAMILY FRIENDLY & EARN THAT SWEET AD MONEY!
4:01 true masterpiece
this dude has a 3d printer but uses trash to build his stuff, friggin legend
Yes people always pick the worst word to fill in the blank. What the ****?!        I meant “what the hell”.. but I bet you filled it in with “what the fuck”
Analogue signals > Digital signals
So it's true that a hole size matters too...
You use 3D printer not very often, I think.
Good video man
Pretty sure the Rode lavalier microphone is a dynamic mic.. not condenser. Right?
Could this be done with like 5 lines of code? Yes   Is Mehdi’s version better? Also yes
Here in Europe we swear continuously without the need to beep or censor anything (obviously not in children TV programmes). I have never understood the hypocrisy behind the beep in teenager or adult-oriented content.
"Pretty loud, eh?"  MY &#!$%Ing EARS!!
ElectroBOOM, Please make a vídeo of How to make an homemade fan
great Setup , huh..!!😏✨🔥
The queen of the night was surprisingly good
I could definitely use one of these some days.
could you imagine being unfairly demonetized from the actual 1k Hertz frequency... might as well just swear if that was the case!
Holy resonance, Batman, you have the voice of an angel...!  Maybe you need to start another channel showcasing your vocal talents.
I really feel the burning your finger with the soldering iron. Too many times :(. But I have to wonder how much of the other shenanigans were just playing up. All? Or most? I can't imagine Mehdi is quite so incompetent IRL. Sure is amusing though. I can't tell you how many things I've burnt because I wasn't paying close enough attention or had any clue what I was doing EE wise. Sigh. It's not a simple and easy profession and/or hobby. Hurts my brain most of the time hahahha.
the headset speakers are called drivers lolo
My mans made a telegraph
Mehdi singing is the best bleeping thing I've seen today.
i truly believe mehdi was actually singing that opera
Why is nobody asking about the osciloscope in the 3D printer bed ?
Very soothing background. It's good to see the chaos becoming symmetrical.😉
8:50 ah the trademark of electroboom
I Like how he swears! 🤣😂
genio
Hey you can use it to generate morse code
5:16 sound-lmao
It's over half of the video when the explosion happen.
The black acoustic panels on the wall look really nice.
2:22 Mr. Boom, maybe don't behave like an old man.
Petition to get Mehdi on Nebula
Make video on capacitor dropper circuit
What is "f*ck" in morse code?
"Today i will make a Fucking button, that teleports you to the austrian village called "Fucking" after being pressed!"
I have a feeling this idea came from a knowledge exchange after his visit and learned it from Linus WAN show
Electro boom i smaak ur videos bru 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 Wen u showing the circuit design or diagram plz show the direction on the current flow
n word button
Gordon Ramsay is sweating over this video
I read the title as “making a fucking button”
Hey realised halfway in the video, Our Man has updated his studio. Amazing! Everything looks much cleaner. 👍
3d printer just printed keysight oscilloscope 😂😂😂 watch background😂😂😂
your studio looks way more professional then before
2:57 Replay button :)
3:20 Impotence or impedance? If your impotent You can’t get hard LOL.
Well you could use Ross's way of saying bleeping words. And that had a reply too.
Very impressive Queen of the Night impression!
(stubs toe) eeeeeeeeeeh... LM(bleeping)AO
Bleeping buttons are a north american thing.  the continent of freedom censors speech.  How is that for a crazy fact.
Now you can use morse code to tell your viewers when you are being held hostage.
Who else was distracted when the final sine wave wasn't 1 kHz but 1060 Hz?
"I need a button to censor myself in real life" > makes a telegraph
Lol I thought you where saying the F word or F-ing good video.
Can wait the craziness he can make when he's finally can code Arduino
Why don't we used LC tank circuit to create the sine wave Is it bec of the low required frequency?
Finally. A new video
The circuit is quite simple "If you're an electrical engineer"
Programming would open up so many possibilities to you!
i was thinking of a other fricking button
Out of context electroboom
we want mercury motor that stirs the liquid as it runs
4:03 when your crush likes opera singer but you are an electric engineering .
I've expected much more, this video is more like an ad for curiosity. It's a good video but I've expected much more.
I've been watching his videos for years but 8:43 still caught me off guard... Also, if I remember correctly, the YouTube algorithm doesn't like bleeping either, so in YT videos you're better off just muting
2:58 That's unrealistic
So now I can speak &£682:£!:
Electroboom+ Michael reaves+hack smith + a billion dollars and you are welcome to the future
what is wrong with a button a pc speaker and 5 volts
i want to understand the circuit, but that 2 pairs of hands distracted me hahahahha
What are those hexagonal thinks behind you 🤔
Dogecoin to the moon
I can't believe how he followed my advice for a new design for the background of his videos, it is just... magnificent... beautiful and awesome
New studio!
You have a pretty good vocal range. That was hilarious.
2:57 I just screamed 😆
Therapist: “don’t worry, *Master Musician Monkey Mehdi* doesn’t exist  Master Musician Monkey Mehdi: 4:02
I just love you Iranian sr.
OMG I laughed at this so much!!! thanks!!!
Holy sheeeeeeeeee mehdi the room look so f#@%$)" good
Great idea. Now if I can pre-plan where I'm going to fucking... shit.... god fucking dammit...... *sigh* Now, if I can pre-plan where I want to... curse... (I did it, fuck yea, oh god dammit)
LOOK!!! He 3D Printed an Oscilloscope!!!
Now I got a new ring tone
does it feed the signal I to the life streaming software too?
Next video: Making The Button create high voltage arcs
4:13 Either you are fooling us with editing or you chose the wrong profession
Evan kale did this a long time ago
It reminded me more of morse code than a bleeping censor.
Tinnitus on demand finally!
New background looking very goooooood
Best enginer lol
Trying to watch this video with autism is a pain in the ass
8:50 Huge bruh moment
8:50 that fire is brighter then my future
what a cool dood
I'm niether a programmer or a electrical engineer. I do it in analog style, that is just play the beep on the violin
We want the old location!
"... a phucking button" Yes that is offensive
My ears are bleeding ._.
Horn?
The rap in the end was so cool 😂😂 😎🆒 👍👍
It doesn't work. You edited sound
I can feel the smell of burned skin..
You lost me at 1:28
Someny sweat words
Lol
11:33 you meant it isn't a steal? Don't you?
once i actually stubbed my toe so hard the entire nail turned black and my toe nail had to be cut off
+the speaking between people was found in 160000 years ago ... -Humanity or primates 160001 years ago: 4:08
8:43 professional 8:50 extra professional 🔥 10:21 professional test
Why wouldn't you do with a tank circuit and an output gain stage?
I like the new background
Electric tape does make things prettier lol.
فاينلي نايس باك غراوند ..
then what does the fucking button does
You should make it small enough to fit in your pocket, that way you can trigger it without anybody seeing it and they won't know what the $#!% is going on
8:50 makes me laugh so hard Lmao
Please upload some videos weekly
I was waiting for this 8:44 😍
I see you've tidied up the background! Nice! Also, fun video once again!
It took me a moment to realize it's Acoustic not Autistic Chamber
a *f***king button* lol
The final product isn’t 1KHz though. It’s closer to a C sharp, while 1KHz is closer to a slightly sharpened B natural
oh u cleaned up your background gg
Please make a speaker .. (with a circuit) teaching us everything..... About the in box air volume and stuff..❤️🔥 .. love from India
Do earphones and headphones also need that chamber? I think since they are already in an enclosed volume that is between the speaker diaphragm and inner ear they shouldn't need that chamber?
there's some drill safety regulations in there that you must be skipping with the medicine bottle
BLOOPing button.
Which button?
When you try to censor your swearing but instead call a ww2  airstrike
I like the fact, that he is literally Bleeping the word "bleeping" when he is talking...  EDIT: Oh wait... He literally said that...
love the new background mehdi. i wish you readded the clock tbh, it was nice humbling seeing hours progress through a 10 minute video
11:23 looks like he has 6 CONSOLES
4:03 The Magic Flute – Queen of the Night aria
If only Curiosity Stream could teach about Audino programming.
2:20 Ooooooo... Mehdi throwing shade. Incoming drama. Haha!
Good looking setup , love the acoustic panels too man! 👏👏👏
You know it's going to be a great day when Electroboom uploads
i like how he not only censor the sound but also his mouth using his hand
سلام خوبین خسته نباشید من یک بچه ۱۳ ساله هستم که داخل ایران زنگی می کنم و خیلی خیلی به الکترونیک علاقه دارم و خوب تو کل فامیل هیچ کسی رو نداریم که از الکترونیک سر در بیار و خوب خیلی سوال ها بعضی وقت ها برام پیش میاد که جوابش رو نمی دانم و شاید ۳ یا ۴ ماه تلاش می کنم که جوابش رو پیدا کنم ولی نمی توانم حالا فقط میخواستم بگم چون شما مهندس الکترونیک هستید می توانید به من کمک کنید؟ و باهم در ارتباط باشیم؟ اگر جواب من رو بدین ممنون میشم.
48 mins ago…….. damn
This channel must be a blessing for anyone studying this stuff in school. It's so entertaining I've been watching for years without any knowledge on this stuff, and with a completely unrelated major in school
The background set-up are now cleaner 😆
That's a zoom meeting I want to be a part off hahahaha
Ah, i really like your new background. Looks very profeccional. In the middle there are the holly scopes, on the right, there are the DIY things, and not the left, there is a... printer even if you didn't use it too much, but I like it
*laughs in European*
Wow, every time he censored his words he covered his mouth while gesturing. I didn't notice until i tried to try to read lips
He basically made a telegraph
I like that at the beginning mehdi was trying to hide his mouth so we cant read his lips when he says bleep
I like your Vitas impression..lol
AWESOME episode 😍😍😍
Nice
Imagine that ur talking and those batteries run out. 😳
h o L y s h I t
please do more about acoustics, i like it
I need to make this
You crazy sir, electric dangger sir what the fuck
Sounds like Morse code :)
Most headphones have a V-shaped response as commonly people like to listen to a response where the lower and higher frequencies are more emphasised, the flat ones are usually for audiophiles and enthusiasts, that like a specific frequency response
9:46😐
Okay, so this demonstration could be useful to hams having trouble visualizing when it comes to resonance and the standing wave ratio of antennas and how much RF they will radiate due to length. Very interesting how similar the concept is especially since you mention impedance matching.
Has anybody noticed that when he says that mistery bleeped out word at the start of he video, he covers his mouth with a hand to avoid demonitization? Only later he reveals the word. That's a neat detal of quality in this video.
Nice work on the room, the background looks much cleaner :D
Curiosity Stream may exclude you but watching your content is more fun for sure.
The sh,%%@$$😂😂
First of all, video editing techniques have improved drastically!
omg. im so happy that im starting to understand the circuits finally. my degree is slowly becoming useful (im still a sophomore)
Speakers dont need to have it but if they dont have one the energy that pushes membrane is just getting waisted cuz when membrane creates sound it comes out in front and back of a speaker. Speaker box is only to bounce the sound that comes behind the speaker so the sound u hear is louder.
and he said "iM..YoU"  RED SHIFTED SHAKING TRIGGERED EFFECT  BEEEE*Crack*EEEEEEEEP
If you want to quickly understand the video go to 4:01 and you will thank me ...  Its outstanding ... : )
Also is that Venta black panels behind you?
Dang, who knew Mehdi could sing? Certainly not me. Thanks for another banger video man, love your content.
##**Boom. I mean Electro Boom.
Duck me? 👍🏽
Yes I did learn a lot, I learned how to make low voltage circuits explode and how to set a breadboard on fire!!
Engineering struggles are *REAL*
Well if this is the video then let me tell you I have an application for this And you can just use a buzzer switch and battery Simplicity is better 😕😒
I think Kevin Garnett had something like that
Love the studio design electro
nd mehedi u will never knwo in ur life to program arduino by heart in fact many software programmers use templates too :) so u also use templates
Congratulations On almost dying
8:43 I thought we wouldn't get to see  something like that this time around lmao
i feel like you could make that foot pedal a morse code key
I’m 665th
The office is looking better, good work!
Youtube actually detects bleeping and adjusts your brand safety score accordingly, which is why you'll find silences or reversed/scrambled audio instead of bleeps.
the beep has to high pitch
fuck, man! the very first video I saw, made me subscribe to you channel because you were hurting yourself... but, man, please stop!
( Happy Face)
WTFFF!!! MOST BEAUTİFUL BACKGROUNDD EVERRRR  İ LİKE İT SO MUCHH
I JUST WANT TO ASK.... WHY DIDN'T YOU USED FUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL BBBBBRRRRRRRIDDDGEEE REEEEECCCCTTTTIFIER
He definitely sold his soul to the devil
Your opera voice was surprisingly **bleep** good.
And here I am thinking Electro Boom made a video with nothing exploding or catching on fire.
The background redesign looks awesome ngl!!
Summary of the **bleep** video, is the our respected and beloved Mr. Mehdi tells us how to make a **bleep** button that **bleep** when you press it. It has **bleep** sine wave for *bleep* sound, and it is **bleep** awesome.
RELEASE THE AIR PRESSURE!!! COVER THE HOLE AGAIN!!!
Finally another @$#%%* lovely video 😂🤣 If anyone got this joke please comment
Wow Mehdi, the office looks awesome!
Holy shit that coloratura though!
This made me fart...I DIDN'T WANT TO FART!!!
video starts with the f***  s***    fre***ng
5:15 best sound for  mgs tone.. copyright it mehdi
Mallory Sonalert SC628D-BTR, switch, battery. Done. 1900Hz. 80db at 2 feet, perfect.
That performance was amazing can we get a Spotify release
Best queen of the night performance I have ever seen in a recording!
i am totally disapointed: No Mains involved! :D
Never heard of acoustic shortcut? Over explained some stuff
im early at 37 mins nd y is he not going live anymore?
You should make a $@&/$# activated shock collar
8:49 the worst things happen when you are turned away for just a second
Hello electroo boomb bro I was thinking that. You dead with covid-19 😂😂😂😂
I see an increase in quality, this is great
چرا باید دکمه فاک بسازم
You are like  joker who teaches about truth of life
1:25 cha cha real smooth
Nice background 🔥❤❤
Can you make the electric candle, your friend Jay from Plasma Channel make one. That candle is really awesome.
That intro was hilarious
They had us on the first ngl
Now you just need to modify the device to switch your mic signal to the sine wave generator when you press the button during a stream!
The background upedate is cool!
Love the new background
So it's a car klaxon?
What's an ing button?
The intro HAAHAHA
I cannot tell if 4:00 is real or what is more likely dubbed over. to me it does sound like him which is making me wonder
“You write some code and suddenly you know electronics, you don’t know a damn thing” As a programmer and arduino enthusiast, I feel personally attacked.
The cleaned-up room looks awesome!
"a &#!$%ing Button" Isn't that called the g-spot?
This episode was super painful for me, because I have headphones and I can hear more than most people. :(
Make shiting button. Whenever you press it u shit
An electroboom video with not much electrocution? 🤔
Man sing better than me
I like the new room decoration! :)
Honestly wasn't the worst rendition of The Queen of The Night.
Some people being adcents?
Bleeping swear words is such an american thing. Too bad Google/YT isn't located in the EU, there you wouldn't have to make stupid inventions for swearing. Swearing is part of our culture. 😅
Electrocute's playing is so wonderful!
every video new studio
your placing too much time on your adds and Sponsors.  Disrupts the FUN.  And why didn't you Blow your self up this time ..  How Sad.
Why don't you use a 3V buzzer that is way louder at the beginning and a foot switch?
Man i was waiting so much to upload again
Electro boom are you indian 🙏🙏🙏
Makin censored button
that is just plain stupid
Holy sh***. That f*** speaker si so g*** d*** Loud. My f*** ear is still hurts.
Liked ur background set up mehdi
Did he 3d printed an oscilloscope?
i  /&%$&! (really) love your videos! greetings from Argentina!
He 3D printed a Keysight oscilloscope!!!
Bleep Bleep!!
Love the new setup, or i just missed you
Holy frick, we're at 4.51 million subscribers
Calm down and mehditate
Beautiful background
Just say Flucker no button needed
Really digging the hexagonal sound-proofing in the background. It looks very professional
Today on electroboom we find out the perfect hole size to create a bulge in our pants.....i mean bands.
Yay! I get to a video within an hour I’m water it in 31-32 minutes of it being uploaded
Thank you for video.
Hmmm have you heard about electronic music?
Maybe make it so the harder u hit, the higher the pitch goes
Does it make life more difficult at all to always have burns on you fingertips? I've always wondered that.
Me watching Electroboom wondering why he didnt die yet
I was going to sleep sir 🙃
ElectroO0PERA 4:15
4:13 I think you just broke something ....
What button??
I guess most of us electricians and hobbyist have our own junk filled with broken electronics
Random senior: You must learn Programming to study EEE Mehdi: I still don't know how to program Arduino
the hands gestures where well put it
4:02 goddamn that was good
I don't know anything about electronics but I like to watch his videos 😁
Sir please make video frequently
1:11 Like screaming the N-word repeatedly with no context whatsoever?
Thank you for the tinnitus
The background kinda makes it look like he's recording from inside the ISS
We're not here to do suffer😅
I’d wear out the button
This is the peak of yt content, seeing a guy struggle for 11 minutes and then succeeding at building a censor button. Absolute Legend
Wear all going to DIE.  Run Run Run.  Oh never mind It was me dying from smoking for the past 50 years.  Guess it went to my ears?
i am studying EEE degree lv1,after watching this video you just make me scared sir
Yooo
I though that you where going to use a 555 timer instead.
Clickbait of the yeae
Nice background mehdi :)
Finally 8:43 🤣🤣 and 8:50🤣🤣
He went full monki 4:00
Hey please learn to program please, just imagine, with his knowledge in blowing stuff combined with programing skills...damn!!    it would expand the possibility in his projects
Yoo this is epic
more like mourse code
The intro tho 😂😂😂😂
*CENSORED* lmao :D
Like the new room update : )
Most usful button.DAMN IT😑
Background is nice
that TAZ Pro thing is huge, holy crap.
8:52 🤣
Ahahaha I remember you talking about it on the live stream.  Nice one!
If even a middle aged dad knows about cancel culture, yea our world is really really gone by now.
9:13 Sounds like Sputnik...
8:17 On a speaker that designed to play the music, they move the resonance frequency of the speaker driver below the useable band by adjusting the box size so speaker will response flat. Some speaker design uses Helmholtz resonator to extend the bass response by tuning the resonance frequency to low frequency where the speaker starts to roll-off. You can look up HexiBase or Toids DIY Audio for more detail.
"It'll grow back" Famous last words
9:26 why don’t you add a FUUULLLLL BRIDGE RECTIFIER for reverse polarity protection?
Tactically covering his swearing with his hand gesture a true genius😛😛 did anybody counted how many beeps he did within this video😂😂
Will you share the STL file, to print the Keysight oscilloscope?
Cool when you actually learn something in YouTube . Thanks, Mehdi
2:57 that actually looked painful
I would like the videos to be subtitled in Spanish, I love your videos; 3
this video is the reason why we all love mehdi!
But it just overlaps on your voice (i.e. We can still hear what you are saying)...  See you in court **maniac laughs**
@4:00 I have never heard the high G of the Queen of the Night singing in Mozart's Magic Flute opera so beautifully.  Quit your day job and these videos and finally live out your dream to be the coloratura you were obviously born to be!!!
This is to certify that this video is entirely Shockless
the 'BRuLrLuRULRLRrRLRLrlrlUuUu' was the reason i watched the whole video.
What a video   Nice beatboxing
My grandmother needs one of these. I want one of you full bridge rectifier shirts! Come on, payday!
Or I can just download a bleeping app on my phone.
People _will_ fill in the bleeps with whatever they want. Remember the count, censored? "You know that I am called The Count, because I really love to ****" "I **** slowly, slowly, slowly getting faster". The censored word was "count", get your mind out of the gutter!
New room setup is awesome ❤️
You should have used a soldering iron for the hole
Addadada
You can just use buzzer
A real electronic man use real components! Not those silly programmable things that does everything so easily
Зачем тебе столько осциллографов ?
When it’s 1050hz instead and you think your weather radio is going off
Good opra
چرا بوق عروسی نزدی؟
I am in school becoming  a enginer your videos helped me
I love that he is well cultured and appreciates classical music He really loves Mozart
Mehdi singing like the song bird from Amadeus Wolfgang Mozart movie! Except she was gorgeous, and Mehdi is a hairy baboon compared to her!
i was not expecting to hear mehdi sing
Lol 😂😂😂
i &#!$%ing love your new room layout
i like your new background
https://youtu.be/kmZMyw7TjnY
gotta start collecting junk...may find something useful like electro boom
Singing channel when?
Audio and video quality has really improved a lot. Good job on the new studio setup. Awesome content as always
Ad revenue… 📉
He nailed it with that queen of the night soprano voice
5:35 Ah yes, this is one of the tricky question with tricky meanings .
Nice background setup👌🏼👌🏼
Saludame
The shocks and burns you're going through while doing a circuit is the same agony for us programmers when there's an error with our code. 😂😂
yes, bulge in pants, understandable
Mehdi just sacrificed his toe for a 3 second skit...my condolences to the foot family
Finally I found a fellow human that makes things that doesn’t know how to program an arduino!
During his any video, i bet whether there would be a blast or not
Great background, Mehdi.
bleep
Let's give a round of applause for that beautiful opera singing
good editing!
Amazing idea bro
thank you so much electroboom for new video
I DEMAND TO KNOW WHAT THE BLEEEP CREATED SUCH A HUGE CAMPFIRE
Interesting 🤣🤣❤️
Mehdi, makin working lightsaber that's gonna be fun
i wonder what it sounds like when mehdi swears
Medhi: makes something **first test** unseen force: I diagnose you with BOOM
Title  #$@%*^%#$^*&%$";&%#%^&:ing boom
I love your vids ElectroBoom there are funny and they teach me skills.
U could just download an app
نمی خوای ویدئو فارسی بزاری؟؟ خب بزار دیگه عه
Well timed! You covered your mouth every time! How many times did you have to re-record?
PIN ME
Im a guitarist and am always wondering how the basics of a guitar amplifier work (tube amps!!!). Maybe its a cool video idea to make a simple tube amp? But probably a lot of work
MA dude mehdi made it real for me for casting this "educational" video in the family room :')  P. S  minus the awkwardness it was a fun video lol
Bob Widlar would be proud
you clearly need to do a segment on modular synthesizers and tone generators now. a purely electric homemade synth with a few pots to adjust the waveform would be rad.
*sees title* That better not mean what I think it means
Alternate title: *Making an Anti-Demonitization Button*
9:20 four hands😂😂
8:50 Remember when he almost set his previous house on fire? well this reminds me that lucky moment🤣🤣
Hey i want to say u a thing               Medhi is alive😅😅
Complete Video On Making A ****** Button 😂😂😂   💙
"Oh yeah, then why you doesn't go to my Sponsor K......" (sponsor omitted) i forgot to disable it lmao
Yes 18minute without subscribe
That's f**ing ingenious.
Did you learned to arrange your stuff properly in the background?
Nice room design, Nice Graphics
Couldn't watch the video past 15secs. Sorry, mate. Better luck next time.
08:50 you have make A Great Fuel!!
People wants to make it but ends up buying a stream deck from legato instead. :D
That stubbing was so _bleeping_ RELATABLE
Warning! Warning! Warning! Age-restricted video (based on Community Guidelines)!☠
So no one going to talk about how Mehdi did a pretty good rendition of the Queen of the night aria?
I got headache from that sound.
Bad video, not enough beep sounds
Snake trainers get immune to venom. Mehdi: hold my beer
I thought no boom .but then the part we love 8:56 and above😂
When the 'Blip' replaces offensive Words Meaning, it WILL get censored too or replaced with another sound. Did you forget Words are sounds too? You are not winning against censorship this way sorry. More is coming.
You sounded like a British guy at the end there. 10:22
Yassse
He is seamus finnigan grown up Still blowing things up
Mehdi just casually flexing with his wall of oscilloscopes behind him...
2:15  @Michael Reeves
More uploads plz
I’m glad it’s not just me that has a random box of broken electronics.
...- - -...- - -
we now know how to make speakers!
Wow Creatively X 100 ⚡⚡⚡
Exactly
4:10 ish, I see you watched that Bryan Cranston/Kevin Hart movie too
Yep, electroboom is 3d printing a oscilloscope
Mehdi's background is now perfect
He is an electrical engineering and he puts out the fire caused by elecric circuit by blowing on it Only ElectroBOOM can do this
Those acoustic foams look sick
welcome back to you ,came after so many days
I see you 3d printing your oscillators
But it is not a precise 1khz use a trimmer to regulate it BETTER!! (And you can use it to speak in morse code as well)
I don't think human parts just grow back
You can also use it to sound like the ekg monitor in hospital...😂😂😂😂like beep beep beep beep....😂😂😂😂
I thought it was the among us emergency button ! xD
8:49 🤣
5:35 things not to say at airport security 5:48 things not to bring to airport security
😂🤣😆
Take a look at Greatscott's Youtube channel, he explains and teaches you how to program an arduino
Goodevening everyone, What kind of switch i can use for switching on and off two different loads with different voltage?
make a 10w version? Someting that would scare the kids away while not bothering the adults using it ;)
You should have made it wayy before and send to PewDiePie
5:15 what the beep was that
Goodevening everyone, What kind of switch i can use for switching on and off two different loads with different voltage?
More like a morse code beeper 😂
Goodevening everyone, What kind of switch i can use for switching on and off two different loads with different voltage?
Goodevening everyone, What kind of switch i can use for switching on and off two different loads with different voltage?
Now i regret sleeping in my analog electronics class when prof was teaching schmitt trigger!!
Goodevening everyone, What kind of switch i can use for switching on and off two different loads with different voltage?
Everyone is watching at how clean your background is.
Goodevening everyone, What kind of switch i can use for switching on and off two different loads with different voltage?
Why u dont just use an speaker an every time your swear just turn on the music/SOUND!?!?! Lol big BRAIN
i thought he died making some electronic component bc he wasnt uploading for so long
"Pretty loud, eh?!?" CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP CONFIRMED
Hey no man i will give three more ......words on face of hater instead of doing so much work
I love this f***ing video.
Mmm geometric form... i like it
Mehid: looking the other side The device: oh it’s time to go in fire
Finalllllly
I dont know why but I burst out of laugh when I hear (kóooooooooo) sound
&#!$%ing
the new scenario is looking great! love it
Making a fu**ING button
ElectroBEEP
You have amazing background behind you❤️ for storage
Remember Mehdi, we don't make mistakes We have happy accidents
*BEEPING INTENSIFIES*
Finally! I am early! Hello from ph
"the circuit is simple" yes, simple.
YOO A COOL BACKGROUND I LOV THE NEW VIBEZZZZ
Goodevening sir, I have a question for you. What kind of switch i can use for switching on and off two loads with different voltage?
I usually imagine the worst word I can think of that still works in context when I hear a beep.
Every physical object has a resonance frequency as it showed in Mexico City during the 1985 Earthquake where 9 to 15 story buildings just fell like jello due to mud of the lakebed under the city and the earthquake waves rebounded off harder material and basically did what a nuke does when you blow it up above the ground and creates 2 shockwaves plus city was worse off than the area closest to the quake 8.1 and since the city is an old Mayan lake canal system filled in.   But the rest of the city was mostly fine just 9 to 15 story buildings.
that's some complicated *BEEP*ing button
Just put some electric tape it will look good  - electrician 💯
oh my...i am so f*ed up
Is there ever a video where you don't harm yourself? I mean, you practically harmed yourself by pretending to stub your toe.
Iam so early....aws video...         I didn't even watched
"stash of broken junk"   Every single human who knows electronics has this one way or another.
He had us in the first of the first half.. People like me expecting YouTube to go haywire after watching his vid😂
پشمام😂😂😂 pashmaam😂😂😂
just use a small piezobuzzer lol
The 4:00 melody is from opera The Magic flute by Mozart, if somebody wonders. Good voice btw :D
OMG my ear after watching this video im hearing beeep
Not enough explosions like if you agree
He don't know that yt banned the word d-rug
Love u sir from india
You don't know how to program Arduino?! Then you should try my sponsor Skillshare!
Just so u know.Love ur videos.I want u to make more stuff with super strong arcs.
swearing button.. go on -.-..
Hey ! Are you Iranian ?
Tell us the truth ... you're the voice behind that song in the Opera in The Fifth Element aren't you? :D
❤️from india
Love it
damn the background looking dope
Mehdi Using his electrical knowledge to skip video editing.
Hello electroboom  🤣👏
Warning: This video is full of ****ing sound!
hes saying bleeping lol
I have no idea what I am watching But its good.
Definitely Will Get A Electron Wand!!!.
I thought I was early and was about to comment last time I was this early Germany was winning but then I saw that YouTube just takes a day to send a notification
Oh my god, that was such a short time!
Damn, your singing is amazing
I know a few people who need this.
Nice👍
Nice room decoration.
Nice lab design 👌🏼👌🏼
Love the opera section
**********(Bleeping Button on) yeah, Mehdi  This guy managed to keep me hooked on a (bleep button) bleep button
😂😂😂😂😂
Sir you sing very well than I thought  You can be in orchestra 😀👍
New setup looks like a SCI FI lab , superb !
bleepy beep
Wattt
No no no its plibing botton
I REALLY LOVE THESE VIDEOS
4:01 that's actually impressive
The hexagons at the wall behind you are  indeed looking beautiful.....by the way..Love from India ♥️ #electroboom
Its 2:10 am in australia please notice me IM IN PAIN
Lol nice one!
Love from Iran
Perhaps the most useful invention for Mehdi by Mehdi!
I think f***ing YouTube will be making this video age restricted😂😂
Setup looks dope ❤️
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
why did he censor bleep
I wish I had teacher like him in my college.
Among of Beep in this video is *Beep*ing Amazing!
Background now looks like good and lights are well placed
Electroboom jist here to say I am from your insta , hopefully this helps you in your statistics or something
I just see his videos to laugh when he goes ⚡️BOOM 🤣😂
1:26 that was smooth af(*bleeep*).
nice decorations
OH
جدیدا خیلی احساساتت رو اگزجره میکنی در حالی که قبلا اینطوری نبودی و ویدئو هایت خنده دار تر بودند. امیدوارم مفید بوده باشد
i have always wanted a &#!$%ing button
Yo the high note! Let's goooo
Anybody noticed a huge video quality improvement !!
0:06
didnt realize i was watching ariana grande
aight, who else tried to read Mehdi's mouth in the first 30s, but he perfectly timed and covered the &#!$%ing word with his hand
HOLY 1 kHz BEEP
This is a pibing botton
4:02 This video should come with a warning... my ears just stopped bleeding...
They are filling the blank with whatever they want, so I make them swear because I am angry .... AWESOME!
سلام مرد
I have never clicked so fast.
This video is gonna get demonetized
AH Yes, A Fucking Button
Give me heart
Wait so I can $*#& anytime WOW this is revolutionary
U r not getting enough shock now a days. We want the old u. Getting shocked ⚡
Electroboom: Tries to make a button  The Button: Explodes because its rare for nothing to explode in this channel
3:00 when she keep &#!$%ing after you &#!$%m
hello, i am syifa. Your channel is very useful from other channels in my country
Fuck man do videos consistently 🥲❣️
Well this button will be useful
If this video is demonizated that just means that the algorithm's against censorship of swearing which means no problemo either way ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I have no filter. I say exactly what I mean when I mean it. I don’t believe in censorship at all.
it's 2:00 am here... just about to go to bed... then I see that ElectroBOOM has posted a video.  Pfft, sleep is for the weak.....
Love that background :D
Who was getting here straight from integza?
So many FFFFFRICKS
6.6k views today 1m views tomorrow😂
Or you know get a smarphone app
The holy bleep at 0:56 was not bleeped properly
Now he can cuss in streams.
ElectroBoom: Wondered if you would do a video on the best calculators to use when learning electronics? There's just so many to choose from.
Uh oh mehdi has done it again .
you got a Knick(beep) subcsriber
The ?&/&,<%* button
its not the same without the uncensored swearing
He requires a FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER button
Cool
no one noticed the new sound panels? Looks beautiful.
I was thinking what happened to you 😁
Box of junk my eyes draw straight to the spike collar.
organized background? THEY HAVE MEHDI
Mumpung masih sepi
You are a lagend
Nice button.
Hey ElectroBoom could you make a video about how to create an amplifier and how you design it properly
That was awsome man you nailed it
[Censored]
pressing the &#!$%ing button!
Hey make a gun Eco friendly gun
@%%$!%^!$@$ that was test
Cool
a &#!$%ing Button
very nice <3
If someday his videos stop coming Understand what happened.
Me, a big brain before the bleeps stop: He's saying bleep
knick Knich knick!😂
Electro boom 9
i love your vids just started and almost seen all
Im here so soon...    I have a lot of hopes for this video .
This is one of the most genius invention from Mehdi.
this is only man that could teach and i woukd learn
Nice setup
I just like when things in this video blow up
The future of *_*beep*_* dolls is here. :)
sh*t 1 Minute too late
the best button
The ﾠﾠﾠﾠﾠﾠﾠﾠﾠﾠ button.
I was watching an ElectroBOOM video and BAM! He uploads a new video
*BLEEP*
ok
wait how can u have 562 likes but 481 views???????
I Love your videos Soo much sir I just wanna say  U r a legend Stay safe sir  Bye.
Im a simple man, electroboom uploads and i click watch, and slap the #&%@$ing button.
Hi, pls make another latity
Yeaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh he comes
First
Hehehe
Last time i was early prince Phillip didn't look like a ghoul
Hy I am gonna be a skedadudler
Do another ElectroLIVE and test the bleeping button there
i prefer the Bullshit button!
Yes it will f**k you up
hi give   me a shout out   ps : Big fan
YouTube would like to know your location
alright im gonna make this because i swear way to much
Electrocuted
This video was a work of art.
I love your videos man!    Nice beeping button!
i was having a bad day until now
Hi !
Never have I ever clicked so fast
background improvement!
Never change.
😘😘😘😘😘
Finally, my electrical skills improved thank you. 💌

Where is the &#!$%ing Like Button?!
Hello
uh oh
ELECTROBOOM
*Enemy Demonetization Incoming!* “Sir, this is ElectroBOOM”
lol
Is that really your voice? Amazing, funny and educational! 👌👍🤯
cool, I was really looking for a simple circuit like this to use with circuit breakers to get an audible signal when they trip, specially for SPD whole-house surge protectors, that tend to disconnect themselves when fail and stop protecting the circuit without the user noticing, so using this kind of bleep with something like a capacitor dropper and a zener could make it a deal, since powering the buzzer directly with mains 60Hz is too low of a frequency to emit a beep from a tiny speaker
I'm shocked he didn't blow up the first speaker and then end up using the second one
I just love how the circuit spontaneously combusts on the second attempt
"it won't be a problem if its not used continuously"  I wonder how many videos it will survive for then :)
Ah I see you’ve chosen Bestagons to decorate your wall
Kudos on also casually "coincidentally" covering your mouth for most of the bleeps, just like in Arrested Development 😄
You need a "rectify" button for LATITY!
:^)
I like the background! "#@&!$*ing" what is this again?
I think I'll go back in time and leave a comment then to confuse people later when this video is uploaded.
YouTube friendly content right here.
