“Ain no toilets out here my friend”
John’s lived a lot of lives 😂
Chemical warfare in the 1600s
I'd say Seagulls probably pooped up there a lot
John was ready to answer him 🤣
I like how these are showing up now in 2025
You’re so funny lol
❤️
Rule 81 of the pirate rule book, don't laugh at the word "poop deck"
😂😂😂😂
For those curious, it's essentially a mispronounced french word that meant "stern"
I mean you can't exactly poop off the side of the boat without risking falling off
Bro went from 0 to CJ on fire in a snap.
The fact his name is John aswell.
The scream got me
In exchange for the Ship, The flying Dutchman cursed him to perform an act with one Keyword.
I forget which word it is but its named originally in another language and the word is like poupe. Just didn't make the transfer to English right XD
Cause John Puupderk is his name
John had to let it conjure for a moment.
The reason he was unresponsive is he was focusing.
😂
It’s some French bs, it means stern, but France is dumb and gay
Why do you nickname your treasure booty
“Shit, man, I don’t know”
Ask why there name is semen😂
Isn’t it because of birds?
"....There are no toilets on this ship....."
"The same reason the sharks follow."
John is always up to sumn
John is gonna take a dump on the ship also your videos are so funny
My dumbass thought he said poop day the 1st time he said it
Screaming!!!!!
"prank em john"
Could be cause of that’s where the bird mostly poop
😂😂😂😂😂
LOL
“AAAAAAAAAH-“
I had to know- because the name originates from the French word "la poupe," which means "stern" - the rear of the ship - and is derived from the Latin word "puppis," also meaning "after deck" or "rear"; essentially, the poop deck is the elevated deck at the very back of a sailing ship, making "poop" a nautical term for the stern, not referring to excrement.
John had enough with the pranks
lmao oh nah
John: "Let me show you"
ayo...
Because of the birds.
😂😂😂😂
Poop deck comes from the French "la poupe" which means "stern"
one of the funniest skits ive seen in a long time
Um actually the poop deck is named after the French word poupe, which means "stern". The poop deck is the rearmost deck on a ship, and is typically elevated above the aft deck. It was usually the roof of the stern cabin, also known as the "poop cabin" or simply the "poop".                                       (I copy and pasted this from Google to make me look smart)
Damn
its poupe
I want a sequel where they’re on a plane…
Fun fact it’s called the poop deck because it’s constantly having to be cleaned
Forbidden knowledge, was intended to be forbidden.
If you're black, don't get on any boats. It's a trap! 💀
I will never not laugh 😂
It's drived from the French word "lapoupe"  meaning back, rear or tail. Stay frosty lads.
The acting is so good 😂,🤣 bro's next level
Ship part names are the worst. Nothing will beat forecastle. It doesnt look that bad until you hear it said out loud (the r, e, a, and t are all silent. Its pronounced "fohk-suhl"
This has major Vine energy! Lol
Captain John Long Drop 🤣
Why did you name it the poop deck?   Proceeds to Shimmy
*based on a true story*
Poupe is a French word
Its called poopdrck because of the french name pummis wich is simmilar to poop soooooo
I googled it and it said that some french word or guy named Poupe which means stern
Prank em John
Head = restroom Scuttlebutt = water fountain/sidebar conversations  P-way = passageway or hall way Bulkhead = wall  Respect the Navy, there was. U.S. Navy before there was a U.S.!!!
John 😨
it’s always John bruh
next things he’s gonna be the man that sank the titanic
LMAO I worked on historic sailing ships and we didn't call anything a "poop deck". There were compartments and areas like the forepeak, focsle, main deck, quarter deck, etc., but no poop deck.
It’s the music for me 😂😂😂
"It's more of a demonstration really" 😂
Fun fact, it's called the poop deck because the word is french in origin.  The word in question is "la poupe", or stern in English.  So, it's actually named the stern deck, as in the rearmost deck of the ship.  It actually has nothing to do with poop, or with people attempting to relieve themselves on it.
Greatest perfectly cut screem
My guy stays a legend 😂😎
Prank him John 😂
"isn't it obvious?"
I think its because birds go on the poop deck and i think you could figure out why
That shake was detrimental😭
Some shit happened there
0:00
A poop deck is a small, elevated deck located at the rear of a ship that is used for navigation and observation. The name comes from the French word la poupe, which means "the stern". The poop deck is located above the main afterdeck, or aft, of the ship. The poop deck provides a high point for crew members to observe their surroundings and help navigate the ship. The captain and officers would navigate the ship using maps, stars, compasses, and landmarks. The area was also used to observe the sails and crew members
That's where you poop off of
My boi caleb back with the vegence 🤞🏿💪🏿
John gettin his revenge
*Me when my wife is off her period.*
bird poop
He doesn't wanna know why the bathroom is called the Head
Okay for real though, why IS it called the Poop Deck?
Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to
You know when the music kicks in, the shit's about to go down (no pun intended)
Rule 81 of the Pirate Code: Don't laugh or question the word "Poopdeck"
Lol
Yo soy Luigi
Caleb's screaming alone makes me 🤣
Ay Moby....
"Pirate code 81: do not laugh at the word 'poopdeck"
Im crying😢
john has effectivley pranked em today
Calebcity and his choice of dramatic music, camera shaking, comedic tension, absurdity, uncalled for aggression, and spongebob level humor just speaks to me on some kind of unspeakable spiritual level
This destroyed my soul 💀
*nerdily pushes up glasses.* "Uhm, ACKSHULLY... It's called the poop deck because its name originates from the french word for stern, la poupe--" *other person aggressively pulls down pants to prove once more why it's called the poop deck.*
prank em john
"I'll buy a boat and force him to watch me poop!" "Why" "Because of the implication"
Here i was thinking it was the poop deck cuz seagulls poop on it 😂
holy fuck I am crying trying not to bust out laughing at this at work 😂😂😂😂
Caleb's scream at the end fucking sends me
THE FUCKING END😂😂
It's probably because it's covered in bird poop
0:00
Music?
Prank em john
Bro y’all don’t realize the level of comedic intellect Caleb has: the guy who named it the poop deck is called John- what do people say when they wanna use the bathroom? “Imma go use the John” or the other name for a port-a-potty? Port-a-John. This man is dimensions beyond us
Wtf is that English 🙈 Baby 🍼 language
My genuine guess is bird poop from seagulls
My canon is that it's called the poop deck because those who get hit by I coming artillery end up a pile of shit
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I will never not laugh at this 😂😂😂
This shouldn’t be this funny😹😹😹
John got hi, back for that prank😭
The term for stern in French is la poupe, so the deck located at the back, or stern of the ship, is the poupe deck. This was back when spelling was pretty much whatever made sense to you, so it ended up being called the poop deck.
why did he do it that fast 😂
Every deck is the poop deck when hes on board
John outta pocket 😂
Things you should never do:  Never ask a woman her age. Never ask a man his salary. Never ask John why he named it the poop deck.
LMFAOOOOOOO
Y🤣🤣🤣
Nothing Jerry Seinfeld said or did in this video was mean or wrong.
Everytime I watch this, it makes me laugh so hard Everytime never fails to be funny
Unc would tell the best camp fire stories fr
John Paul Jones is a Pirate
Hey, when ya gotta go, ya gotta go💀💀
I swear his screams are the best 😂
The concern in his face
It would be full of shit because of the birds. But I like this alternate history better.
😮😅
Lo
So I looked it up, its actually named after the french name of the Puppis constellation, which used to be part of the larger constellation of Argo's ship, hence giving its name to the back of the ship. The more you know.
Never ask a man about his income Never ask a woman her age And NEVER and I mean ABSOLUTELY NEVER ask a Ship Captain why that spot is named "the poop deck".
‘Because of the seagulls obviously, my timbering were just shivering at the thought of the poo stains
JUST DROP IT OVER THE EDGE 😢😢😢😢
Lmfao
Prankem John
Not be the nerdy comme ter but the poop deck name cam from the latin word puppis which means back of the ship
Caleb so darn funny😅

Well, there are no bathrooms on a ship is mt guess. Prolly dropping Cleveland Browns off the poopdeck.
I physically see bros menacing aura

I could be wrong but I think it’s called the poop deck in reference to all the shit birds will drop on that part of the ship
Why he scream like dat 😂
Nah ☠️☠️
johns second prank
Wait till he finds out about the cockpit
I'd react the same way
I had a really terrible day. I was feeling depressed and morose. This instantly cracked me up. Thanks Caleb :)
John giving unknow stand user vibes
I literally was dying of laughter after I saw this!😂😂

So that’s why them dudes be cleaning the deck erryday 🤔
The real answer, as you might expect, is thanks to the French lmao.

John went from pranking to pooping
In the first watch I think I forgot English
Of course JOHN would
I watched it like 50 times and kept dieing each time lol 😂

What about the cockpit
Ah yes, the infamous "john"
“John, why’d you name it the gangbangdeck”
His scream sounds like the noise nelly makes at the start of the song dilema 😂
Caleb why yo teeth look so perfect?
Calebcity never misses
“Wow, so that’s what a sh*t looks like up close, huh?”
I see what you did there with the name “john” . Bases off how he’s dressed and the name, he’s supposed to be the face of “long john silver restaurant “?
John is a menace
"why they call you day quill and night quill?"  " DONT ASK HIM ABOUT HID NAME"
I swear a guy named John bullied Caleb when he was a kid
*shits agressively*
This made me crack the up so hard
(AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH)
Gets me everytime
This is so relatable it happens all the time
because is a slave boat
I want to do a vid wit jit😂😂😂for a long timeeeee
"i need to time this very carefully"
dont worry he was looking for his phone so he can search it up!
I think the actual reason it's called that is because of bird poop not human poop lol
Note to self - do not eat while watching CalebCity. Almost choked from laughing when the pants started coming off.
Oooh hhheeeeeyyyy, you ever hear the story about the foc'sle? Come closer, and let this ole salty navy veteran tell ya a sea story or two about it...hehehehehhehehehhe.
Wait until he finds out how the cockpit got it’s name
*John “Splash” Johnson*
Prank em John
My guess is that the bird always be poopin on it
The poop deck is the deck that makes as the roof of a cabin built in the rear of a ship
Though he was going to say "sike na just name it because a lot of shit usually happens here."
The Waffle House has found its new host
John is gonna go take a john
Prank em john
John is a menace
He said lemme just pull my pants down and take a fresh shyt so he can understand bkuz the name just isn't self explanatory enough‼️😆
It’s to confuse and cause chaos
I forgot how funny you were man have a good one
nearly choked to death on water
oddly enough, the word 'poop' here rather refers to the stern of the ship. Yes poop is an old word for stern, lmao We got it from French who got it from Latin Puppis, which is itself of unknown etymology, all meaning 'stern'
You gon find out
When the music starts playing, you about to be traumatized.
To my knowledge I think the spelling of poop deck was something like poup deck.  Ok so out of curiosity I decided to look it up and its a french word like la poupe or puppis in latin.
Prank em john
Good ending: He was justing reaching for his phone because he wrote down the reason on his phone, and the reason was that he just thought it was funny 👍
It's the french. It's always the French
The way you turn around 😭😭😭😭😭

Fun fact: It's called ‘poop deck’ because the word ‘poupe’ is French for ‘stern’ or ‘aft’, meaning the back of the ship
God loves all of you

"He's pulling his cock out!"
You shouldn’t have trusted John, the guy who pranked em

John: “My goals are beyond your understanding”
Make this a tik tok
There is no way he just made me laugh at a poop joke..
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Birds shit on it
He really said “let me demonstrate•
Starboard just got a new meaning
Seagulls
Every name has a purpose...
Hello
“John why’d you name it the poop deck?” *Minecraft cave sounds play*
Caleb: “Why’d you name the spot the poop deck”  Eren Jeager: “Show him the real reason John. Show him. DO IT”
The poop deck isnt real
Cuase it's part of the ship you poop on. This is basic nautical knowledge.
bro straight up turned around to duel u with his flint blicky
John finna prank him
Promote that man
I always assumed cause birds sitting on the masts would shit onto the deck
Birds?
You can see the moment he realized the truth
John: ಠ_ʖಠ
Why’d you name this spot the cockpit ?
Cause it’s the read :3
Prank em john
He had to do it. After all…. It was just a prank bro.
Aye John why is the toilet called the head?
bro you toss the shit (or shit off) of there. Nobody gonna be leaving a raw-ass turd out for Zach nd Cody to find.
Prank him, John!
Nerd here, for anyone wondering "poop deck" comes from the French word "la poupe"  *flies away*
Lmaoooo
No somethings bad about to happen when the music starts to play
Cause birds like to shit on it
Classic John takin a shit

John: YOU ASKED FOR THIS CALEB IM SORRY 😫 💩
The skyward ship theme
Wait till he finds the good ole cockpit
This time, John’s pranking back
Fr though, why is it called a poop deck?
LMFAOOO 💀💀💀
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm only guessing poop has a different meaning
prank em john
The mad shuffle he did 💀
Many people would confuse him for Long John Silver, really he's the reason another name for toliet is John
This too could be a Stephen King movie.
Still better than the cockpit
PRANK HIM, JOHN
Shiver me sh*tter 🤣🤣🤣
Anyone know what the song/ambience is
Joh- ahhhhhhhh
I can't breathe🤣🤣🤣
You know somethings wrong when someone ask a question and the other person is silent for like, _30 seconds._
“Koriwah….”
At the local basketball court, there’s a corner that’s always concealed and it’s called the piss corner
Another question can you call people in that profession another name than Seamen
🤣 THAT TWIST
I thought it was a rascist joke😂
John's a sleeper agent.
🤣🤣🤣 PTSD
Aww it got cut right at the good part
I could see it coming from a mile away yet it only felt like 2 feet.
I already knew cause of the silence 😂😂😂
Prank em John!
This boy funny man 😂😂
XD
Well as we know "Prank em john"
Don't ask questions you dont want the answer to
Joh.. Aaaarrgggh!!!
That scream at the end killed me😂😂😂
Is this the same John that pranked em?
Man probably the funniest lil skit I've ever seen
That scream got me 🤣
Okay, but why did I see this in a “perfectly cut screams” video?
The actual historical reason behind that is because sailors and pirates had to sit on the ledge and poop over the side
John needed to use the Jon
Planes in next:  “Why did you name that the Cockpit?” “…”  “Why… Cockpit…?”
Bruhhh i almost fell out my work truck 🤣💯
My god I always wondered why they named it that know I know
It's the poop deck because it's where you see the storm coming and shit yourself as your going right towards it. Nah jk it's where you watch and see the sea monsters approaching. Nah actually though it comes from some Latin word puppis meaning stern and people have weird humor
Horrifying
😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hmmm
Seagulls
I think the historical reason for it being called the poop deck could be something like "That's where bird poop hits the ship most often"
AHHH MY GAAAWD! 🤣😅😅🤣🤣 So unexpected!
Kick him before he shits😂
His name is John too 😂
The way he shaked his pockets causing the ship to shake is like thr skip is in his pockets.
John be trippin man
Is this the same John that pranked him lol
I must be 5 years old this made me laugh harder and more genuinely than anything has in a long time
The scream 💀💀
That scream at the end got me
W
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I wasn't ready
I did not see that coming! Lmao!
You knew something would happen when the music kicks in
Yall goofy
Can't say I'm too surprised by the closing  outcome since the slow buildup gave horror-like clues! Lol 😂
Prank em john
The Incident.
“Glad you asked”
WHY I GOT ON TWO BELTS?
LOL So fuckin funny
Well, you asked him! John was just being polite.
I need a part 2 for the cockpit
😂😂
Another epic prank from john.
Heard about what happened with Amber Heard and I immediately thought about this video
😧
Back in the day they use to put the barrels filled with poop in the bottom level. The fumes would collect and boom. A massive hole in your ship now exists. So they started moving them to the top to avoid that. That’s actually why we call poop shit. It’s an acronym for Ship High in Transit
Larrypoopdeck
John why did you name it the poop deck   John:My goals are beyond your understanding
Don’t even think about asking him about the cockpit😳
This went from 0 to 💯in like 5 seconds😂
Wait, why DID they name it the poop deck?
Dawg I’m crying 🤣🤣🤣
why did he wait so long to just  start aggressively taking off his pants?
THE CUT SCREAM 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
J-john? Like… the pranker john?
I love how at the end he leaves and on repeat it looks like he came back. Like he's stuck on an infinite loop.
Caleb wasting his talent not writing horror/thriller movies.
This is what a perfectly cut scream sounds like
My reaction was so delayed lmao
This is the funniest video I’ve seen all year
Ayo
"Rq tho why arent there any toilets on this ship john?" JOHN: "CANT WAIT TO SHOW YOU THE POOPDECK!"
I always wondered why it was called that. Not anymore.
Because that's where you can first see that you are being chased by pirates, and $#@& yourself.
THE WAY I COUPDNT BREATHE FROM LAUGHING TOO HARD
Burst out laughing
Why IS it named the pOuP Dek?
Jesus christ i almost choked on my goldfish with that scream-
Prank em John
Ain’t everyday you get a shitpost  Speaking of shit… why is it called a poopdeck
My boy got his teeth fixed
Bro his scream😆😆
for people that actually want to know:  The name originates from the French word for stern, “la poupe”, from Latin puppis.
This is so stupid but it has me crying laughing.  I guess the comedic timing and you know what's coming but it's just so well done.
Why is you saying it like that bro!? My stomach hurts from laughing so much
🤣🤣🤣
I knew he was going to make a poop deck joke as soon as the video started😭😭😂
Why'd he do that? I knew it was coming, but it still caught me off guard.
Prank em John

Prank him John
I have been his fan since my first year in college I am proud to see him make it this far keep working hard
That scream 🤣
Would've been funnier if he just stood there for whole rest of the video and we were meant to wonder why he named it that(we all know why anyway)
He pranked him
Prank Him John: Secret Ending

Prank em john
I love how John moves like a grudge ghost😆
I like how his name is John  A fitting name, to say the least
😭😭😭😭
Holy fuck I'm actually dying 😂😂😂😭
Why is the bathroom the head?
Eren: remember why you are here. Prank him john
John has pranked many a men in is lifetime and the poop deck is mere moment of the pranks
*Prank him John*
🤣🤣🤣
hAHhahHaha, Silly John. Always Doing *Freaky* Things!     🗿🗿🗿
He had dead when he scream
Ngl I like the modern day captain drip
The ominous music is hands down the best part.
Prank ‘em John
i am dead.
I never though I  would laugh so hard at someone standing w their back to me LOL
Ah yes, getting a tour from John Poopdeck.
*AGGRESIVLY SHITS*
The emphasis the 2nd time he said “POOPdeck” 😂
Prank him John
Same thing with the cockpit on planes 😳
It’s because of birds shitting all over it. One of crew’s main jobs is: “Swab the poopdeck” and that’s because when you’re running around topside, you don’t want to slide otherwise you risk a man overboard.
0:18
Best 20 seconds of my life
John moved side to side and made the ocean shake. Wtf?
😂😂😂😂
Interview the guy who designed men's rooms. Why are urinals so open?  🙄
🤣🤣🤣
Prank em john
long ago, the poop deck had a normal name, everything changed when johns friends pranked him
well shiver me timbers
WHY JOHN?! why did you name that spot the poop deck🤣🤣🤣
I'm WEAK the pants rattle😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Much love for the perfectly cut scream 😂
Where’d the cockpit one go
I love how John is his default name for all the weirdo characters
bro said i’ll show you why
Tbh the reason is because birds always pooped on that area of the boat.
I WAS WONDERING WHY HE LOOKS WEIRD, BRACES CHANGE YOU A LOT, STRAIGHT TEETH AIN'T ALWAYS THE BEST CHOICE
Prank him John 😭
Too funny!
i love how when he ask them a question they stop moving completely 💀💀
Prank em
Meu deus
Never stop sharing, I'll always be watching. Don't get left behind > Promo'SM!!
His scream tho 😂😂😂😂💀💀💀
Your timing and twists at the end of your skits is literally equivalent to Key and Peele skits. Why haven't they signed you a show deal on Comedy Central yet.
Oh no John is pranking again
Bruh I was weezing harder than Carl wheezer
Caleb still got it.
Just the sudden drama in these otherwise regular interactions! XD
This should've blown up...because they using it in meme vidz that's getting thousands of views!!!!
Why do they all wear yellow jackets lol
Dude is such a fool! 😭🤣😭🤣😭🤣
https://youtube.com/channel/UCoSrY_IQQVpmIRZ9Xf-y93g
What? I'm not even sure what happened here. 😂😂😂
So nice to see John getting a new role as a captain now, before he was a prankster at sleepovers but now he's sailing of into the seven seas.
ok but why do they call it the poop deck ?
Caleb, did you know there’s part of the ship named “dolphin spanker”? Gotta be some jokes there
The poop deck is any raised section of deck aft of the quarter deck. It is *not* the bathroom. The bathroom is called the “head” and on a sail ship was at the bow
Can you send me that beanie? I really like it
“Why’d you name it the poop deck?” ***Evil Chuckling crescendos into maniacal laughter***
its not the even the word poop that is making me laugh its the way he said it
to the windoww to the poop deck
It's called the 'poop' deck because it's on the 'rear', of course
Where u get the purple hoodie
Awesome
Why though, John?
The ominous music is everything.
John: I’ll show you why
The cockpit 😏
Caleb's giving Luz Noceda vibes with the hoodie, we love to see it
Ah yes the old menace. John
It’s the scream for me
Wait wait wait, this seems like something John from "prank him, John" would do..this him?
For the people who knows how long John been doing these things can I get a hell yeah
What about the cockpit
No one:  John: *Aggressively takes off pants*
Man's about to give him a thorough up close example.
Johns still pranking huh
"Hey real quick tho, why'd you name that spot the poop deck?"  *John:* “Well, since you said that, lemme show you...”
"Why'd you name it the poop deck" *Fortunate son starts playing*
Prank him John
0:18 that scream LMAO
JOHN PRANKED HIM!!
john's story is building up from the pranker in the vine to the namer of the poop deck cant wait whats next
Arguably funnier when you consider that John is another word for toilet
😂😂🤣 Caleb never miss
Lighthouse Vibes 💀
This John..... He seems like a real prankster...
Prank him john
John 7 years later after the incident
nah john really with the shits 😭
I noticed caleb often does that tongue thing at 0:12 in these types of moments. Why?
wait til he finds out about the cockpit
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣😂😂😂
Lmao
“Prank him John”
The term Poop in poop deck is what the English half-hazardly tried to translate from Latin. In many Latin based languages, a word that sounds and is spell vaguely like Poop exists. The British and Germans alike bastardized the Latin word, and decided to transform it into a word that means Poop. The original Latin word was used for the Stern, which exists in various forms across all Latin languages, like French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. Unsure why, but Anglasized words are always ridiculous in comparison to its origins.
Why'd he run away? John was about to answer his question.
The cutoff had me crying
Just for fun, I figured I'd say that it's called the poopdeck because of seagulls/other birds. The poopdeck being fully exposed makes it a ready target for LOTS of birds
cause pigeons and other flying creatures poop guess where they aim
It's always John LMAO
Why’d you name it the cockpit?
There John go prankin again
The menacing music is what gets me
Fun Fact: back in old times people used to poop off the front of the ship, because they didn't have toilets.
Bruh
I love how he actually made the background toss and turn when he started panicking. Nice little touch!
Thoughts on milk
Caleb: John… Why’d you name it the poop deck…? John: (starts unbuckling his pants at light speed)
prank em john!
Why did you name it the poop deck?  *Flashback intensifies*
Prank em John just got a sequel
fun fact, the name "poop deck" comes from the latin word puppis, which means the stern (back) of a ship. So the poop deck is the deck that's on the back.        (technically it comes from the french "poupe" but that is just the french derivative of "puppis" so... yeah)
the delivery of “John…” alone is Oscar worthy, i’m not lying
Lowkey taking me back to the vine days 😭
Pretty sure they named it the poop deck because birds would shit on it all day.
Prank em john
Now do a cockpit one
Anyone saw the one before this? Caleb asked John why the pilot's area is called the cockpit
its the gorton fisherman puffer form me
Lol
Lmao
You ever hear of "I took a John?" Exactly what happened there
XD
This got stolen by thememesheep on YouTube on their latest video around the 7 minute mark
Never should have pranked john
He said what was it called the poop deck 🤣 😂👌
Next do an airplane and the cockpit
😂😂😂😂
HOW ABOUT BLIMP BUT ITS WORLD WAR 1
Dude this made me laugh way too hard
The real reason is because that's where most of the seagull poop would land because it's the broadest part of the ship
Haha you already know-
You have served your country well.
This is in almost every meme compolaton
Wait a minute john as in LOOK WHO FELL ASLEEP FIRST PRANK HIM JOHN??????????!!!!!!!!!!!!

Ask pilots why their cabin is called the cockpit. Pretty sure that there are some strange happenings occurring in there.

A teacher at my school shit herself in class yesterday. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
I immediately knew it was gonna be about the poop deck
I'm going to assume the real reason is birds poop on it
There goes John again...
i used to believe it was called the poop deck because of the bird poop
I didn't know someone could stand so menacingly.

The irony of his name being John

🤣🤣🤣
Birds
prank em john
Prank 'em John
still making bangers so much respect dude 😭☠️
legit tho
Do not walk into a john prank. You'll never be the same.
The name originates from the French word for stern, la poupe, from Latin puppis. Thus the poop deck is technically a stern deck, which in sailing ships was usually elevated as the roof of the stern or “after” cabin, also known as the “poop cabin.” and yes, I copied and pasted that from Google.
is it me or did he get new teeth?
Prank em johnnnnnnn
Don’t ask him about the blow holes in whales
He takes off his pants so agressivly
John pranks em again
lol
The panic 😆
😂😂😂😂
A warp portal opens sending him to Battlefield
Because there's alot of bird poop on it
LMFAOOO
Homie look like wolf larsen
🤣
yes caleb"s shorts just as great
“Jamal why did you name that spot the cockpit?”  “Jamal??”  *Unzips pants*   JamaAAAAA!
He was staying still because he was concentrating all his will to move his bowels to his anus. He has to rush to take his pants off quick before the explosion.
😂🤣😂🤣
Prank him John: the trilogy
69k likes
Hes been pranked one too many times... He will never sleep first EVER again
I guess that Guy is gonna need some HYDRO THERAPY
So unless everybody last name Caleb, I guess this the Caleb and John city channel 😂
Lmao
The area with the wheel is called a cock pit no joke. caleb u gotta mention that next time
Wait for the cockpit. LMAO.
John character development is so good: he keeps going with his pranks !
Short vid still funny asf. Do more of these
Everytime I see caleb turn around and just standing there silently I know something is going to pop off😂😂
😂😂😂omg why’d you name that spot poop deck
Don't ask John about the cockpit worst decision I ever made😨
Poopdeck is his activation word. John is a sleeper agent.
make a video called when you look away for one second during math
That is the look of a man who's lived through some things...
I laughed so hard at the end😂😂😆
4/10
That is the face of a man who has seen some shit, both figuratively and literally.
PRANK 'IM JOHN
Fun fact it’s called the poop deck because that’s where you hung off The boat to take a shit
Poop jokes really are the funniest 🤣
Don’t get it
people who know, they know what was once here
fun fact: the captain of a ship in latin is named the "gubernator," making the phrase "gubernator stent in puppi" (the captain stands on the poop deck) a real and serious sentence
This man is so good with the timing of music
I knew exactly what was coming and it still f*cking got me lmao 🤣
now ask the person who named all the airplane areas why the named it the c pit
lol
So John also made Boats?
This man is going to take over shorts
Y do u call it the cockpit tho
Lol
“Prank him john”
every fucking skit is funny..
Shitting on a toilet
cant wait till this poop deck thing gets mentioned in another video in the future
Lmao!!!!!I  DEAD!!!!
They called it the poop deck because of all the seamen
It could be bird poop
becuz it's where all the duty is done
This guy doesn't age.
Aye I get it now….
Getting a tour from the one that named all of the plane areas:  "Why'd you name it the cock pit?"
Prank em John
😂😂
😂🤣😂🤣 This man is hilarious 🤣😂
😎🙄
One is caught up playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self🎈
Caleb: "John...John, why'd you name it the poop deck?"   John: "...Isn't it obvious?"
Yes but no there are 2 common beliefs how the name poop Jack came about the the 1st one is it the originated from a word in a different country and the 2nd 1 was because it was the area where they would throw over the buckets of feces because you could get it far enough away from the ship without half thing to worry about it coming in contact with the ship and because it wasn't the far back usually you didn't really have to worry about it trailing behind and  Is getting stuck to the hole and rotting it
PRANK HIM JOHN!!!😂🤣😂
"GET OOOOOOOOOOOOUT!!! GET OOOOOOOOOOOOUT!!! GET OOOOOOOOOOOOUT!!!" :P
🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
What about the cockpit?
LOL IT BEING NAMED POOP DECK THO!!!
E!!!!
Prank em john
John finally got enough of those pranks
Ironic since the poop deck is at the back but the toilets are at the front
Lmaoooooo
Drakes horrible party trick: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hOyFwJzjzg
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
As John I would like to say no comments
😂😂😂
Lmaoo
John why'd you name it the poop deck.  John: Lemme show you.
Caleb are those retainers???
Stop trusting john bro. He a predator
Aaaaaaaaaahhhh.🤣😂🤣😂
It was such an obvious punchline but just as funny
John why
CALEB IS THE GOAT HERE. Litteraly all his skits are good. all of them.

Historically, black people have never done well on ships
Prank him john
Poop deck is legit y'all, I googled it 😂
creepshow ass music
Actually scary
🤣🤣🤣🤣😆 Look like he took a huge dump on the ship!
“John, why’d you name it the poop deck?” “…John?” John having war flashbacks
Haha if anyone wants to know: When most people die , they tend to shit themselves . More battles happen on deck so 🤷🏾‍♂️ 2+2
Caleb: "Why'd you name it the poop deck?" John: "More importantly, wanna know why my parents named me John?"
😭😭😭🤦🏾‍♂️
The way John pulls his pants down is so aggressive. Must've been holding it in for awhile
Dude funny 🤣
He stares so longingly in the distance... And then.....!
😂😂😂😂
I always thought it was named poop deck because there's always seagull shit
Yolo
Prank him John
Lol
Prankem john
and then john.....
Prank em John
Sheesh, people are probably looking at me funny cuz of my sudden outburst of laughter at work. Lol
don't tell him about the plank on pirate ships
Oooooohhhhh noooooooooo
I have no idea why I died at this, I never really laugh at all.
Prank him jawn
"Prank him, John."
“prank him John”
John finally got his revenge. we all knew the prank went too far
The moment he said poop deck I got scared
Honestly, hats off to Caleb, I watched this in a neutral state and only 1 second of this 20 second video made me on tears 🤣..
Gets me every time
good point
True horror
Poop deck
I just started doing skits on my channel just like you
He asked for an explanation, not a demonstration, John. ._. Well, anyways, next spot is the Birds nest! John: "Huh- why's it called-" *Raven's begin attacking him from above for approaching their nest.* "AHHH"
petition for part two
"The name originates from the French word for stern, la poupe, from Latin puppis. Thus the poop deck is technically a stern deck, "
This makes me laugh but gives me chills  It makes me laugh because it's hilarious ofc.  But it gives me chills cause a few days ago I discovered "pirate ratio" and it was a video of a guy going "L+Plundered+No wenches+Marooned+You have scurvy"   and I thought that was funny so I thought of my own such as "+scallywag+sea dog+peg leg" and so on    but then I thought of "+swab the poopdeck"  And THEN I thought "but why is it called the poopdeck...?"  And then this video got recommended to me a bit later... We live in a simulation
Wait till he meets the pilot explaining the cock pit....
The shake bruh 🤣🤣
I knew where this ship was sailing before he finished his question
"Prank em John"
He finna show you the reason
.....now Im scared to visit a cock pit .....
The ahhhhhhhhhh haha
I think the yell at the end was what got us all 😂😂😂
Hope he's not stuck in a Time Loop...
John’s evolution has started and there’s no stopping it
That scream took me *OUT* 🤣
A seriously though it was about the crows nest
Alternate Universe "Why'd you name that spot Thee sex deck?"
John coming back, he really coming back
JOHN NO
Dammit john STOP PRANKING ME
John back at it again with the pranks
All fun and games until a pilot shows you the cockpit
I knew exactly what to expect, and yet I wasn't expecting it when it came 🤣🤣  Also, is John supposed to resemble John Smith? Apparently he smelled like literal doodoo water.  Also, I watched this 3× in a row this morning and 4× in a row this evening. Why have a great, balanced Meals when videos ARE your meals.
we don't talk about jhon
They did it in Spanish too. The look out (crows nest) is called "carajo" in Spanish which means fuck/dammit. The big sticks that hold the sails are called "vergas" which means dicks.
Yooo I'm already dying @ "real quick tho"... Yeaa we need know why the poop deck lol
Prank em John!! 😂
The skits just aren't gonna hit the same after that time travel one.
We dont talk about poop deck heck no
When The Tongue comes Out, ya Know what's bout to Happen
🤣🤣🤣
U should make more of this 🤣!
John is everwhere
"It'll be easier if I just show you" -some crazy dude named John
Im glad I don't look at run time or over analyze your stuff Caleb- this shit caught me off guard in all the right ways with genuine laughter. Keep it up bro much love
Wasn't there's one of these about a plane?
Poop deck so he, ok wow
This is giving me Pokemon Red Vibes
John really on his bs again
Is this the same John from "prank him John"
John is a menace fr
damn.. this is the first calebcity video i didn't find remotely funny at all😐not sure how i feel about that
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Man you are my inspiration for this youtube stuff fr... im glad you aint slow down on the lit content, ima be up der soon too
Don't ask questions you already know the answer to
He really tried to show him whyy 😭
It’s the dramatic pause for me 😂😂
Don't ask questions you aren't prepared to handle the answers to.
💀
John is a menace
Saw it coming but still loved it
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The way Caleb says things kills me 😂😂😂
I guess he had to...  *use the John*
man he still funny
Repent from your sins
Omfg the scream is killing me omfg
Caleb taking over tiktok
Just for clarification it's Poupe Deck it's a french word. Other countries, like Portuga,l use the term Popa that has the same root word, it being from a romance(Latin) background. Knowing doesn't help though, still freaking WEIRD too hear it in English
John: this is revenge for pranking me...
perfectly cut screams
OH NOOOOOOO!!!!
It was actually cuz all the seagulls that would sit on the sails, would shit down on it.   So, not that far off.
things you must don’t do: ask woman about her age ask a man about his salary ask dayquil and nyquil why is he called like that ask john about anything about words that is similar to sus words like deck, busy, etc...
bruh John is a freak!
bro go his teeth fixed?
I cant wait to see the poopdeck and the cockpit clash
Cant wait to see the backstory for the plane naming guy.
lol 😂
What tha hell
You think John still pranks people while they sleep?
prank em
John fell into the one piece flashback episodes.
Ye
Prank em john
Caleb: "John, why'd you name it the Poop Deck?" John: "Well what was I supposed to do? Name it after myself?"
😟😟😟
Lolll the quick initial movements of him dropping trousers is hilarious
John:*  * exaggerated exhale * "So it's come to this... just when I was beginning to like you too. You discovered my little secret. 🌖 Since I like you so much Caleb, i'm going to give you a head 10-min. head start...  I'd start running if I were you". 🙈  *Painfully transforms* 😑 😠 😡🦵👣🐾 👋 🐺 💪 🗣 "CaYyyY- LURRRRRGHH... !?!"
Cale city is undefeated! 😂😂😂. Mans the goat 🐐
Not to ruin the vibe, but they named it the poop deck mainly because that was a prime area where seagulls like to drop they're load, and some guy who was probably pissed off that he always had to clean it decided to name it that way
LMAO
😂🤣🤣⛴️💩
If he had a fart sound affect bro😂🤣
Lmfao god damn 🤣🤣🤣
Prank him John
*John...... haven't heard that name in a long time....*               Prank 'em john
Bro be more active pleasee need more of your videos funny af
i see caleb showing off his new purley whites
“John why is it called the poop deck” John:pulls his belt ofd
Personally I thought they called it the poop deck because birds pooped on it all the time
this nigga gotta fit for everything
Wait like a year for a 20 second video
John is a man of focus,  commitment,  and..... sheer fucking will
Did this video come before or after the captain’s hat?!
I thought he was gonna turn around slowly while smiling
*JOHN!*
Oops forgot to drop a like
Realizing you're in the WRONG ship.
Don’t ask him about the poop deck
*Prank him, John*
He named it that because that place was a piece of shi* almost literally
naming him John is a pretty safe bet for the time period. you've got about a 50/50 chance that's who decided the name
John LMAO
Ayy Caleb I see those perfectly aligned teeth.. looking good ma boy
Hey guys there are these guys that are trying to leech off Caleb's subs by self advertising
John is always out of control
😂😂😂
I love your videos man
e
Wait till he ask about the cockpit.
If anyone wants the legit answer, it got its name from the Latin 'puppis,' which means stern.
John pranked em again💀
please pray for me, I can't breathe, and have passed away. I'm at the pearly gates still laughing, and had to show st peter this video on my phone. did you know  you get to keep your android when you die. not apple, or I mean, none of the people with apples come to the pearly gates. I think they go to that other place.
It was funny but please make the skit longer or drop more often if there gonna be this short ijs
💀
lmao
Eren: "Prank em' John"
😂😂😂😂
I knew it was coming after the cockpit situation
Prank em John
It actually comes from a french word that wasn't translated for whatever reason.

Lol
I died when he paused and the music started 😂
Not sure if anyone is interested, but I did a lot of naval term research to help with my D&D campaign since we use ships a lot: Poop Deck (also known as the Stern Deck) comes from the French word "poupe" or "pupe" which is derived from the Latin "puppis", which means, well, "stern". Stern being the rearmost portion of a ship.
Quite the chuckle
John back it again lmao
🤣
"Prank him, John!" "Haha you already know.."  *aggressively pulls down pants*
Goddamit John. First the prank and now the deck.
Loooool Caleb so silly 🤣🤣🤣🤣
m
I mean, why else would they call it the poop deck if it ain't for p💩💩 pin? 🤔🤷😅😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
prankem john
John sure has up’d his prank game
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 "he pooped on'eem!"
Where’s the cockpit video
Soon as he turned around, i sensed the villainy
That scream is funny af
This is literally Peter from Family guy
lmao
Prank em John
Just wait until he goes on a plane and get shown the cockpit
lol
Cause it's where they flung off their buckets of poop. You do it at the back of the boat so it doesn't get on the boat.
Plot Twist: John is the brother of Jeremy, the one who cut Caleb's hot dog in half longways.
the AHHHHH got me so bad
The "poop" deck is so clean.
"The name originates from the French word for stern, la poupe" ... of course it's because of some mixed language bull shit
Jon 🤣
Prank ‘em, John
Caleb starts making shorts : Us : seems like it's 2015 time
Lmaaooooo
So that’s why the planks felt so soft to walk on…
Prank ‘‘em John
lmao
Prank 'im, John
The whole comment section is people asking you to check out their own "funny" channel; don't bother.
John conveyed so much without saying anything
Kinda short do but it gets the job done
Lets go Caleb
In the Caleb cinematic universe, every acts like a normal person but caleb can always make every character flip their switch and start shutting everywhere
Let me find out John's last name is Silver. XD
Some people would poop there selves before being thrown over board, from fear or to disrespect them before the heinous act... See the the plank in the beginning...
Even after seeing the cockpit video and knowing the punchline i still couldn’t help but laugh
😂😂😂😂
Hilarious! But,  *I found something really cool….*      *Jesus is coming back soon! Are you ready for His coming?*  He is coming back as the King of all Kings! *Belief doesn’t affect truth! The truth is that:*   1. God exist. 2. He loves you and cares about your every need. 3. You need Him because your a sinner and have broken His law. Death happens because it’s the *wages* for our sins which are crimes against God.  4. He sent Jesus to save you from your sins. He paid the price so you wouldn’t have to pay for your sins! Repent (apologize and turn from your sins) and come to Christ today. He’s coming back for the people who know Him. But hurry, because when He comes back He will judge those who didn’t accept Him. If you have any questions, ask me below!
😂😂
John was about to prank him….
The way calebcity moves in his skits is hilarious. He goes from 0-100 really quickly
*Squat*
Ayee yooo Moby..
He was so scared to say the answer he sh*t himself
Wow, so that’s what a ship looks like up close huh? 🐻
this takes "prank em john" to the next level 😂
You know why 😂
Otacon: John...John...JoHn, jOhN, JOHNNN!!! (Deuces fires) -- Real name: Porta John
That perfectly cut scream
Does pirate booty go on the poop deck?
JOHNS BACK

Pupdek
legit horror movie vibes 😆
"Prank him, John!"  John was back at it again...
*prank him John!*
"John, why'd you name it the poop deck?" It was LITERALLY a poop deck
Aaaaaaaa
John's origin story is building up...i see what youre doing there Caleb.
He's a show-er not a tell-er
😂😂
Hey look we’re early
He knew it was coming yet he asked about it and got suprised
Does anyone know an actor called Tobby Kebbell?  Caleb looks or reminds me of him (Even though he’s Caucasian)
😂😂😂
damn its always John
lolol dam man you always making me laugh with these man! After a rough week these always help...Thanks
John has been through shit we've never seen before
"Prank him John"
Man he gets his pants off pooping hits me hard😂
"prank em John!"
This man really made a good Poop Deck joke
5 minutes earlier Deck hand: haha prank him John
When I heard the name “John”, I already knew this was gonna crazy
Why did you name it the poopdeck? John: RUN
Mmmm 🤔 invisaliners huh
“Why’d you name that spot the poop deck?” John: regrets the prank
Poop 'em John!
This man Caleb is a different breed of funny lmao
Three things you never ask  A man is income  A woman her age  And John why he named that spot the poop deck
Prank em John
This man kills me every time 😂😂😂

John equals best characters of all time
Legendary
This is nice😳
I wanna here about the Starboard side tho
john's prank deck
the scream 😭
The ocean was bigger than we were prepared for. How we didn't think to include toilets on the ship was an extreme oversight. But in our defense we still believed that asshole Columbus when he said the world was flat. We all thought it would only be two hours at most on a ship.....but we were wrong.
prank em john
Caleb liking the shorts ehh
Fastest hands in the west.
john makes everyone question him about the poop deck😀
E
Caleb out here doing shorts now🔥
Early
Just wait until he hears about the piss cabin
"Why you name that spot the poop deck?"  My brain: speaking of poop YO STOMACH DO THAT SH*T UP!
I love how he stands for like 10 seconds before rapidly pulling his pants down
When the music came rolling it I already knew what was up 🤣
prank em john
*Prank 'em, John!*
"John why'd you name it the poop deck?" "John?" 30 seconds later... "Prank him John."

I lost it when the music kicked in😂🤣🤣
I guess we can now say... PRANK HIM JOHN
John really never forgave the prank played on him till this day
There’s only one thing you should never ask John and Caleb just asked the forbidden question.
John has PTSD of why it's called the poop deck
the quality went up for me as soon as he turned around
😂😂🤣never skips a beat
da poop deck
ahhaha
Of course it's John
Caleb is a freaking comedic genius
ive been binge watching this guys vids
John is such a prankster
I love how this dude didn't even add any ocean ambience sound...at all 🤣🤣🤣🤣👍🏾
"If you've ever heard the phrase poop deck, you've probably wondered where it came from and what it means. Although the phrase sounds quite amusing in English, the poop deck of a ship has nothing to do with poop.Aug" hahaha
John at it again. Bro really needs to stop going on tours to John's revolutionary creations
Wait till he finds out about the scuttlebutt
There go John prankin' again xD
That damn scream lmao
Prank em john
never ask
Someone got decked there and then ….and then
Every video is gold.
new prank 'em John lore just dropped
Prank him John
"prank em john"   21 years later:
if caleb started posting shorts more frequently I'd be so down man
prank 'em john
:)
Sorry Pit. You know too much.
I was just watching ur “If Forgot your password was a person” vid lol.
*Caleb gets a text later* "DONT ASK HIM ABOUT THE POOP DECK"
Haha prank em John
lol But seriously, why? It's actually from the french word for the stern of the ship, 'la poupe". They just englishized the word. Kinda shitty, if you ask me.
I know he was gonan do it but I laugh anyway.
Clever of him using the name “John.”
Lmao 🤣
🤣🤣🤣☠️
john been through some sh*t you could tell by the way he pullin his pants down
Thats a pretty good name not gonna lie, like I'd name my house that
Plot Twist: *John’s last name is Seagull*
😂😂😂
The horror
This has the same energy as the Moby Dick skit
HE NEVER MISSES
Prank em' John!
Gonna have an explanation on why people be swimmin in Davie Jones locker huh John?   where is this man’s locker supposed to be, why’s the inside so damned?
TIL: Long time ago, some English guy decided to translate the French word "poupe" by "poop". Sound the same, doesn't mean the same thing. ^^'
John’s epic return
The silence then the screaming is just Perfect
I'm in literal tears. This laugh was needed 🤣🤣 why's it that every time Caleb yells/screams it's Hella funny
I bet his full name is Crapper John
This gives the same vibe as Dayquil and Nyquil
“Gosh Diddly Darn It! Johnny Keeps Pulling His Darn Trickeries On Us!”
xd
The shit shimmy though 🤣
0:19 me realizing I liked the video without even remembering I liked the video
He never misses with these
My boy leveled up the absolute hardest! Him & King Vader blew past everybody that came out in that 2016-2017 era
Caleb is the best at just ominous silence punctured by someone trying to ask a question.

Why did he name the toilet the head do?🤔
the people who made the poop deck and cock pit have some explaining to do
Lenarr, Griffy, Caleb, and RDC are the goats of making skits. They all inspired me to start making skits last December. Lmk what y'all think.🙏
They just had to prank em and give him trauma
nice
This video is crap.
The moment he asked the question, I knew where it was going, but when he started pulling his pants down, I lost it😭😭
This the same John that pranked him
"Prank him John."
I’m not that early
Plot twist: This is the same john that pranked his friend
LOL
John's just pulling another one of his wacky pranks
PRANK EM' JOHN
"John, why do you call it the Poop Deck?"  John: "You fool! you've activated my trap card!"
Man.
That’s why them pirates always telling you to swap the poop deck!
So that's where pirates dump all their loot.
uwu
Naw dont fall for it, john just pranking us again
Time to jump ship
Psych, it’s because John Pooperton named the deck area after himself
Why you name the place where you steer the cockpit?
john always playing
dude I thought it was gonna be a horror skit. Lol
Show him John!  Yeaaa, you already know
Why did he name it the poop deck?
I don't know. Ask the guy who named the cockpit.
That’s so disgusting.
Need more videos like these, keep up the good work 👍
LMAO x 777...!!! Sincerely...
His face was made purely out of terror; understandable.
Perfectly cut screams

Saw the cockpit one... *I understand now why John pranked him like that*
That actually caught me off guard

Bro caleb makes the funniest skits
The shittiest of posts
I wish all the teachers answered questions by showing them on practice
Poop deck: The deck forming the roof of a poop or poop cabin, built on the upper deck and extending from the mizzenmast aft.
Legends say that he is still asking John why that area is named the Poop Deck
You just can't hold anymore  Let it out come on... 💩
John has been waiting years for someone to ask that question
It's an old joke but a good one.
When you hear that weird ominous music you know it's about to go down😭😂
John is one sick sadistic son of a bitch.  but also good at pranks.
“John, why’d you name it the poop deck?” “…John?” *John having war flashbacks*
Amazing.
