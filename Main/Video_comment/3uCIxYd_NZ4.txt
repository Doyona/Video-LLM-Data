No one has ever landed on the moon!
Mat do a road trip
This is the first time I have seen this video.  I've watched the gt3 portion of this video at least 10 times. Incredible piece of engineering and "mechanicin"
14:34  he has both of them now 😅😅
MOON LANING WAS FAKE!
lol on 15:05 the tires and skidding know wonder Adam z crashed lol
Freddies insurance has its fingers crossed the whole video... 😂😂😂
Congratulations 🎉
This is my favorite MA build.
Comedian Al Murrays the best man to ask about the moon landing.
Moon landing was a studio production
nah no moon for us back then
❤
NASA faked the moon landings.  The internet proved that numerous times, and many books and NASA employees confirmed that hoax.  Also, ISS is fake, there are no satellites, no nukes.
Keep at it mate. You do some great work. Can you do My BMW 840ci? I wish I had your drive to vehicle savive 👊🇬🇧
Yes he is a great guy, he has the drive and corrisma. I'm 57 and he lifts Me. Top lad 👊🇬🇧
Where did the RS end up to did i miss something?
Shall you try any UK Alusil remanufacture cylinder head shops before order the new one? The milage is almost zero so your cylinders actually new, the only coatung has to be remanufactured. Try to call to any of them 1st and see what they say.
Defo yes we went to the moon 🌙 🎉
Hard work breeds talent 😅
I'm a good friend ❤️ love car
Nobody has been to the Moon..
918 was the realest shit
Why is it so expensive to get it to UK? Rich guy like yourself gotta have means. Broke aSs guy like myself bought a wrecked car from copart in US and it is already shipped to Finland. And
Love the dude wearing flip flops while pushing the car out of the trailer 😂
Jack wearing flip flops cracked me up!!!
hope your uncle came from the moon
The moon landing is totally fake!
No chance man has been to the moon…
Hi Matt Sam from Halifax Canada you already know you got one of the best YouTube channels going and will try to get Freddy hooked up with any subscribers we know but let’s get you to 1000 and then 2000 subscribers so come on everybody help Matt out take care
Funny ducker 😅😅 go to America, vibe in the garage and rag Freddie's sick cars 🤣🤣👌👌 good times
Watching the rebuild video made the GT3 a dream car for me. Thank You
My bad, my brain got muddled and I gave you some duff info. It was 222 months to the day after 9/11 that Covid was announced. 222 is also a big number with them. “Wuhan corona virus” (the name of the first strain) =222. The name of the tabletop pandemic exercise (held less than 2 months before Covid arrived) was “Event 201” and it was organised by Johns Hopkins University, World Economic Forum and Gates Foundation. “Event two zero one”= 222. “World Economic Forum” = 222. “Order out of chaos’” (Freemasons motto) = 222 reverse. Russia invaded Ukraine on 22/2/2022 to start the next round of chaos but the war started 2 days later on the 24th and there was another reason for that which I’ll explain to anyone interested. The answer is 68, if you want to work it out for yourself and check WW1 & WW2 start dates to see where I’m going on this one. No more conspiracy stuff, this is a petrol heads channel👍
I thought you bought the GT3 over in America & did the rebuild there, I didn’t know the car belonged to Freddy
TAKE IT HOME
Wow Mat, el GT3 es una locura, un saludo Crackkkk!!!
I always feel that German high end cars are just classier than Italians definitely the engineering is .for me and please hear that my opinion my choice I find some of the lambo and Ferrari dess a little OTT for a car .for a track car yes  but I like it a little subtle .my favourite car manufacturer is Austin Martin which says it all.Porsche are class.i hate Lamborghini for the fact (that you made clear to me) is most there parts are from other manufacturers but most sports car have this but Lamborghini sells the spare parts for maybe in some instances.10 to 15 times.more.than the same part upon the original manufacturer  web site .It says it all about Lamborghini and the type of people who buy them You never see old money with a Lamborghini it's all new money
0:05 lent not lended my friend
My Civic Type R is NA I could only imagine how good that GT3 is.
Didn’t know Creed Branton got into cars, after leaving The Office.
I enjoy your vibes with all your toys you gifted young man your family and friends always pray over your projects be blessed in Jesus name come visit Cape Town SA .
Mat driving left hand we actually get so see your good side now haha.
Porsche is the BEST! You can have all the hypercars you want, BUT the Porsche is just insane is so many levels that the other brands just don't!
I literally started watching this channel this week and I am hooked love the content keep it coming bro..  ❤from USA
I need a GT car in my life 🙌😎
I see mat armstrong upload, I click
Only being in the right car can bring out these types of giggles amongst grown men, it's the purest expression of real joy.
911 GTRS-  Sure it's great... It's a Porsche.  "A garage without a Porsche is just a dark hole" —Walter Rohrl - Porsche Development
Left-hand drive car no good for McDonald’s drive-through in the UK 😂
moon landing, TOTAL BULLSHITE!!!!!
No way we Americans landed on the moon 😂😂 they just needed to boost country morale 11:34
So you are related to Lance Armstrong LOL
1:07 Wuee a stroog-lein wueed ahhs xD
Pagani, love the Zonda still, or a Koenigsegg perhaps ? I might liek one of the special Lambos more, but they're even more unobtanium.
Take it to Adam lz
What is it Freddy’s car now 😫
I wish I can have a dad like yours.. My dad and I couldn't even have a small talk at all..
Of course they landed on the moon. We tracked it from Parkes in Australia…
I get that it’s expensive to bring the GT3 over, but the story of that car is irreplaceable. You will forever regret not having that car at home.
When you sell it?
If u dont think man Landed on the moon u r an idiot. 😊
Mat armstrong don't sell the porcher
Gay
Whoa! 2:25 I am digging that shorty Astro van.
I actully wondered if you were related to neil armstrong
You got more Tech in your GT then they had in '69  so If you can convert it to go to the moon we allready did .. If not
Nothing like a Porsche
Mat…. GT3 on Copart Newbury right now! Go get it!!!
mat i think the next Porsche you do needs to be a akira nakai RWB kitted Porsche 👍 now theres some good content for your channel fitting a 20-24k body kit lol
the sound of the gt3 is a symphony orchestra 🔥🔥🔥
Is it true that Tavarish bought it from you? Someone was saying that they saw his sticker face on the car at SEMA? Can you confirm? If not would you mind donating me the car? There's not one Hmong Person in the entire world that owns a gt3 rs and I would be the first if you make my dreams come true 🫶🫶
I see u guys stressiing when rolling out the car, big tip. each side have a block of wood to stop it from falling off the back. No poop in ur pants and no stress :D
@mattastrongbmx would you ever do another Porsche rebuild but with a Rahn Welt wide body?
We have witnessed Matt’s possible first “Murica” moment!!!  😂
Moon landing was Hollywoods best effort, but anyone can see that surely?
Almost had to repair it the second time it was awesome
Matt Armstrong bought Audi R8 V1 blue . Next project
Matt Armstrong bought Audi R8 V1 blue . Next project
Sorry the moon landing never happened. If it did, the camera man would have been the first man to land on the moon. Basic mathematics.
Camera man really should’ve filmed outside when you were sliding the gt3
That Porsche GT3, absolute beast !!! I smiled the whole way through watching y'all smile while driving it! Love it !!! ABSOLUTE BEAST!
why is it always the starter motors😂
Brilliant 👏
Theres a GT3 at Copart just waiting to be brought back to life..... only £55k
That Porsche is something else Mat.. Really great job on that one.. I could see why you want it back!!
Your ferrari used to be inside bolton shopping galleries advertising tack days next the subway shop 100%
Us landed on the moon multiple times.
Moon, no way 🙂, the porsche is amazing can understand how you can miss it!
Hey Matt, Fancy a 2017 Ford Ranger suspected blown engine ?
Matt needs to move to Florida! Too bad hannah doesn't want to leave home! Oh well! Maybe one day!
very cool
Moon landing fake
Moon = Yes Some official film footage = No GT3 = ❤
I love watching your channel, im just a random person who randomly saw one of your videos a while back and loved the video and started watching, i know nothing about cars, everytime i watch one of your videos i oearn something, i hope to see you working on hyper cars and stuff, i cant wait to see what youll be working on in the future, my dream car is the apallo IE amd it would be cool to see you work on one and modify it🤍🤍🤍
The reasons behind leaving it with Freddy, were more than warranted. But.  I knew you was gonna regret/miss the thing whenever your back over the States with Freddy. You really do need to get a uk registered one Man! 🤞🤜🤛  (Your reaction after driving it again spoke a Thousand words Brother!)
😂excellent
No moon landing
That guy was pushing the P1 off the trailer in flip flops 😂
There is a 911 gt3 in South Africa 🇿🇦
I hope freddy doesnt mind the abuse you gave the GT3 great video
I respect your work but man we need to know when to give up the rs6 you wil fix one side it wil brocke in some other place. Just sell it or trade it do something.
Like for the GT3!!!
Dude you can't give someone a present and then, later on, say you want it back 😂❤
Matt and his dad are taking those toys to the limit, thanks! Overseas hard workers!
We need a 6hr video of the rebuild 😮😮
I know that smile.  I get the same feeling from my Porsche 911 as well.
Lended?? 😂
That gt3 sounds mint.. 👌👌
Dude pointed thar GT3 right at a tree! Dangggg! 15:06 Plz slide your seat back!
space suit boot prints don't match moon landing boot prints for landing.
Smiles all round here.
lol “I don’t wanna abuse Freddy’s car.”  *then proceeds to abuse Freddy’s car*
I’m confused because at what point did the Porsche stop becoming your car and became Freddie’s car?
Please daily vlogging this channel will reach 5 million subscribers
The GT3 is just something else. Fingers crossed that you get the chance to do a UK spec one. Either that, or like you say, a GT3 RS.  As a side, note, you may owe Freddie a new set of tyres.
Sure the Americans landed on the moon. Keeping a secret in this big company - impossible. They also placed a mirror on the moon.
Mat why did you say the gt3 wasn’t yours? You  said it was Freddie’s?
In my opinion, a car never feels right or as good once you buy it back and own it a second time. Regrettably sold a car and wanted it back for years, eventually got the chance to buy it back and it never felt right and how it felt the first time I owned it
Dreamcars everywhere 😂😂😂
Building a Mclaren P1 that swam for a while reality the zpace landing well ask Oliver Stone he'll tell you!!!🤣🤣🤣
IM REALLY BUYING A PORSCHE IN 6 YEARS TIME.
You only buy a GT3.  Never sell it !
Mat, any person who tries out a 911 will get hooked for life, it`s just how it is. I know we will see more of 911s with you and that makes me really happy!
That Mclaren looks abandonded to me...
As a scientist who has used some of the instrumentation still currently on the moon... yes we have landed on the moon haha
You should do a collab with DTE TV absolutely quality mechanic & top guy that doesn’t get the chance to do videos on the type of cars you work on,
Broski we know u bought a blue crashed damaged gen 2 audi r8 v10 plus , just pls make a video about it im waiting for you to salvage that car on ur main channel   PS: @Chis Slix bought mark's also blue gen 1 r8 v8 with a manual gearbox
Omg, you should definitely work for a 918 rebuild. OMG.
Dont want to abuse Freddies car... then proceeds to abuse Freddies car...😂😂
Honing! 😀 Does anyone else wonder why the miserable complaining unit owner never surfaced? I guess Freddy’s got them used to it by now.. 😀
100% did not land on the moon.
Should have took a few bits off Freddy’s Ferrari whilst he wasn’t there 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
☑️
Bro l really think u should take it back 😅
Landed on nae moon 💯
Mat, shall we go halves on a gt3? 😂😂 I was gonna get a 991.2 GTS but now I’m having a tough time seeing you In that GT3 again 😅
Mat, take the GT3 back home in pieces like you did when you rebuilt it......
GT3 =❤❤❤
Nice one mat it was so good seeing you in the porsch again, and you made me laugh 😂😂so much when you was going round and a round in it and nice one Freddie what a guy 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧😁🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷👍👏😁👍
You need at GT3 RS on the channel that would be an insane rebuild
Good good I reckon that sums it up 😂
6:11 watch what he does
Lol y’all actually believe in the moon?
Matt and Freddy are just so such kind souls.
Neil A = A lien 🫢
Imagine Freddie, Matt and Rob dahm the valvoline crew all fixing up a hyper car each and racing them!
Man, That GT3 is FANTASTIC. On my bucket list to own one someday.
Great to see you work behind the scenes!! Ya being new to this youtube things huge learning curve!! My 14 y/o son and myself rebuilding a 2012 Ferrari 458. Continued success to you we continue to dream of 1K subscribers. Fun stuff!!
Sigh lended really 🤦‍♂he 'lent' it to you mate.
If you get the porsche in the UK get the 2020 and up model
Matt mate i found this channel a few days ago ive binged 10 hrs of it over the weekend great cotent. Great story from humble beginnings. I need to start on chapter or car building so we can collaborate in the future. Cheers from sc
I’m Loving this second channel Mat!  Just so much fun and EVERY one is Rrelaxed
Buy a porsche gt1 strassenversen or build one with wrecked porsche from copart
DDE made they 599 conversión to manual , they know the people that made de kit conversión for your Ferrari
Love the VIBES!!!
That GT3 is awesome, who could possibly want an EV over this! 😂
There is a channel using your content for YouTube shorts. It’s called Motor976
That gt3 in that color everything about it is incredible
Moon landing = fake! 😂
Moonlanding = FAKE !!
Reason for breaking engine is MORE DRAG COEFFICIENT  of new body kit!
Haway mat "lended" is not a word 😮
Does anyone in the comments have any knowledge on 62 reg VW high up! Cars? I have recently found my driver side rear and front footwells soaked with water. I have no clue where the water has came from as seats, roof lining and surrounding metal work is all dry. If anyone knows anything please let me know!
Did I just hear your Dad's Name ? (said by the camera man?)
That Porsche is savage and I know the video don’t do justice to what it can do .lets petition to Porsche so you can buy one 😂😂
Unfortunately Stanley Kubrick Nasa's greatest rocket scientist has  died, so I don't think we'll be going back to the moon any time soon.
I really hope you get another GT3 soon, Mat. Actually, I know you'll get one, you're the best Youtuber.
I just saw the tag line, and the song "Renunited and it feels soo good" came into my head
Got for it, Matt! Get another Porsche. It makes you happy, and that's the whole point of all this. ❤
Anyone else’s sphincter twitching when Matt was giving it the beans?
I really like Porsche's now, no thanks to Matt!
Im going with no on the MOON landing.. All hollywood set with props. Maybe at a later date unknown to us but not in the late 60s. just my opinion
It’s all fun and games until someone gets hurt!! Be careful!!
Fuck the thumbnail bro! Get to thrashing!
I knew he was going to say pagani
My 1.2 vauxhall corsa with a 4 inch exhausted and a big wang would have that porsche over a quarter mile 😂
The Porsche💜
Hey Mat, go and ask Buzz Aldrin if they landed on the moon. You might get a bit of slap. The most convincing argument for landing is that the Soviet's at the time did not deny that they did...
Of course we went to the moon! Just look at the photos taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) in 2009: you can clearly see the landing sites of the Apollo missions.
Nah Matt has to be the GT3RS
Get one on the go at home . 🇬🇧
You definitely deserve a gt3. So if any of your fans own one they need to crash it so you can buy it. Not too badly though and don’t get injured.
New channel...Armstrong Astronautics, whereas you restore discarded rockets and then take speed to a whole new level.
#3 on Trending.  Mat, you made it G <3
When the video of the new r8 is coming 😊
man hasn't landed on the moon
What happened to the Mclaren 720s? Waiting for its updates💯💯💯💯
This video is from 3 weeks ago then if he was working to take the cars to sema
Having coffee in a shop, as a car zooms by Friend: That sounds like ur GT3 Freddie: Naaah it can’t be…(12 second pause)…can it?
Armstrong say we didn't touch the moon
Can't wait for tavarish finish the POne sun
I don't want to abuse the car it belongs to Freddy - OMG - What then does abuse look like?
You and that GT3 is the best content, no joke it translates to pure Porsche 911 heaven!
I enjoy the channel,  but I'm not going to arse lick like most on here have 🙂
Jack rolling the P1 in flipflops...
Leave the Audi in the states bring the GT3 home ? 😂
Best channel on YT man. I love Mat.
Nooooooo! I think we heard Mat's fathers name! 😮😊
GT3 i totally love over any McClaren,...get one again
8:51 It's hilarious to see how they both laugh in sync.
Love that GT3
Damn... i was thinking... if mat would build a hyper car a pagani was fire...matttttt think pagani......
So funny. Rippin Freds cars!
And the speed limit never came close to been exceeded. Not even once
i think you need to sell your cayman and get your well deserved gt3 (rs)
Wow , is so old , if this is before SEMA .....
Mat you should get your own TV network man. Anything you put out there is just good entertaining #HWBT
From all the cars in this channel I would choose the Porsche too! 😂 I love those cars. I wish I had one some day.
reunite it with adam again since hes also in florida
I am really starting to lose interest with you I want to check your McLaren and you’re not showing so be done before Christmas and no show
Audi R8 next? 😎🤫🤫
Yeah that Porsche is just a thing of beauty , I actually 3d printed a minature bucket seat for a guy that owned a purple GT4 same colour here in Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 to strap in between the crossbars for a sentimental teddy bear to sit in !! Incredible engineering ! Reckon you should do another over here and keep it this time 😜
When did Tavarish buy it? I must have missed it despite watching both channels..
All these cars are training for an eventual bugatti you need to get one mat i know your capable
@mat Armstrong, there is a freshly new GT3 RS that crashed in South Africa if you keen
Great watching you back with Freddy. I feel like you guys need to buy a car/s together that you can both go crazy on. One for the US and one for the UK
Matt's pissed off
We've seen this car????
Mat should get the Koenigsegg that lewis hamilton used to own and got crashed again recently
Freddie watching you abuse his Purple Peril !!! 🙈😲🤣🤣😂😂😜🤘
Love Jacks attitude to H&S.  Roll a P1 with no brakes off a trailer?  I think I'll do it in my flip-flops! 🤣
The GT3 is the higher driving pleasure that you can found . All the specialist agree with you . I hope that you will find a way to get this GT3 back . SEMA was a crazy adventure . Thank you for all the videos .
paul walker died going sideways on a corner on a Porsche 😂
Cameraman is so negative
100,000 people worked on the moon landings…. not sure you can align everyone to lie if they faked it ….
You should definitely move to the US, or Cumbria UK 😂
nahh the sound of the GT3 is ridiculousss 🤣🤯
Kneel Armstrong
Build another Porsche build another one. I enjoyed that build.
Did not land on the moon
Who let the Christmas turkeys out?? 😂 8:52
matt when u get back can you fix my first car, got loads of engine problems with it and can really afford to fix it
Well done. Give that man a bells
Ha the P1 is not a hyper car it a regular gas powered car no battery
I’m taking my driving test 1st dec 8:10am , any tricks and tips?
Why did you sell it in the first place 🤦🤦🤣🤣that emoji is your dad laughing at you get it back the dream car
No, no one did land on the moon... just NASA with their CGI rendering
Please rebuild another GT3 in England so you can have one at home! Easier to get the parts there too as we've seen!
Nice driving
No comments ahahahaha greatings from Chile
RS is too much, GT3 is sweet spot
This is a cool insight into the work that goes into producing a video
I don't need nice tumbnails to came and check your new videos. Hugs from Portugal!
The only way I’m experiencing a gt3 rs is in gran turismo VR 😂
Matt I must say I always love your energy and attitude.  As well as your pops yes. And you are surrounded with good people who wanna help because you’re a good mate.
I wonder how the car insurance works, does the UK car insurance stay valid in the US or is there a separate procedure like getting insurance in the US?
No.  Didn't land on the moon.  Fake.
Matt the only car person I watch
That's a yes we did land on the moon lol
Definitely didn’t land on the moon ! It was all a total set up, if a human could walk on the moon, they’d be an Alien, Neil A backwards is Alien ! Buzz Aldrin’s mothers name was Marion Moon ! 🤔 MM = Master Mason ! All so called “Astronauts” are Freemasons ! Secret Societies.
I think we can agree that money can buy happiness. Just buy a GT 3
Never went to the moon.
One word ?… wowza
The delivery driver rolling back a £2 million car in his sliders. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sh!t Mat, you deserve that GT3. But gesh, my hands started to swet a little when you where sliding it around, - seemed a weee bit out of control for a sec there ;D! But hey! More content! :D :D
If there car that was existing and cheap I have it
That Porsche is wicked mega.
Mat you seem to be having so much fun in the U.S. I’m praying you and Hannah don’t leave the U.K. and I hope your children are able to grow up in Britain and be seriously loved by their grandparents ❤️❤️
What’s the situation with the starter motor failures ……..
why didnt ypu put some blocks of wood at the end of the ramp so i cant roll any further
Hopefully Freddy can land on the moon in his P1 Evo 😂😂
I want a friend like Freddie…
But you still cant get it back to you can you because the cost of customs??
FFS…What a Fake  😂
Love looking behind the scene mat and i agree that GT3 is an amazing car the sound is fantastic and the handleability  is off the chart. I would love some of the florida heat right now it pouring with rain and 0c in the Uk michael
@mat armstrong enjoyable and fun videos always motivational and dad is always on support
Of course we landed on the moon! Leave astrophysics to others fella.
The GT3 is clearly dialled - how do you think the McLaren will compare?
the next video be like: "I bought a wrecked Space Shuttle at auction!"
Hope you fixed the rs6
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Mat's dad his name is Tony 😮 finaly i know it 😂🎉
That’s really nice Porsche…. Everyone needs at least one in there life
Freddys not gona be happy
It's Freddy's car... I'm not gonna beat on it..... proceeds to beat on it...
Of course we landed on the moon. How else would we have discovered the Clangers.
Bring it back as parts. 😂
Ty Ty Thank you ! The Porsche ride made my day .
No one landed on the moon.
Freddy will need to race the DDE 720!
In Matt we believe 🙌
Love the video! Love your positivity and gratitude to the people who extend kindness to you!
Sell or do a raffle on the Aston and the black Lambo and then buy a gt3 rs back here (UK) CRASH DAMAGED for content 😜
Mad respect to you mate. I watched your other video when you took the engine in and out and in and out again.  The laughs are genuine.  Thanks guys
How many people does it take to launch a rocket from earth?=250000! How many people does it take to launch a rocket from the moon?=2... (Not including the guy who panned the camera.)
living the dream man i was hesitant when i saw your thump nails for the first time but you make great content and seem really sincere keep the content coming
Thinking about your comment about wanting to get gt3rs or whatever the letter combo is... It's a 911 underneath...  Nothing else even the same car rebuilt,   is never the same.  You would be wiser to buy it back and import it in 2 years time when prices drop... Sometimes options are overlooked.
Want a 1982 rabbit hatchback 2 door?
Why did you bring this beast back to life then?
Absolute Magic mate, and how you and freddy's channels feed off of each other, stuff of legends.🎉 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦
Awesome car dude 😊
mat plz get a gt3rs
Yes.... we landed on the moon 😊😊
I love my 911 w/ TC off. It can be a handful, but it is FUN if you know how to drive..
There’s is absolutely negative 0 chance that we’ve landing on the moon lmao. I love Freddie but he’s delusional
No we didn’t land on the moon! They don’t even know what’s on other planets it’s all fake!
Landing on the moon???... yeah thats a firm no 😂
The fact this gem of a super car was in your possession is epic. Huge achievement & I can’t wait to see the next one you get back at home 🙌
According to the flat earther we didn’t land on the moon we landed im Arizona lmao
Move to Florida Matt we would live to have ya out here
ok..moon landings..yep, they happened...SIX times, even the Russians confirmed Apollo 11 landed, as their telemetry was tracking their own unmanned lander called Luna15 which crashed into the moon July 1969
nah mat you NEED to move to america
As a professional thumbnail artist, I really appreciate the effort you put in to get your best shot in cause the thumbnail is what’s going to draw new audience towards your channel!
That’s a hella good car that Porsche
Urgh!   Found out Tony's alleged name!  Noooooo
Sorry but that P1 is not 2M car. Not any more
When cabling or wiring has been in the sea water--they are doomed! The saltwater permeates along the wiring into the copper! Even trimming the ends is unlikely to prevent eventual issues! Be warned! Change the cabling and looms!
No man has ever set foot on the moon.
why is there always a different E46 M3 in this mans garage xD
You should get a gr4 or rs
Where’s the stradman link up content? ☹️🙃
Koenigsegg should be your next build
I want a gt3.
Came to the comments for the moon landing thoughts...
USA Landed on the moon Six times, and there going back and building a Moon base, it's called the Artimis program, and it's Awesome 😊
Sorry Freddy
You gotta do a g wagon rebuild at some stage
please restore a 930 model porsche or a 964
I’d love to see an ep where Matt gets taught how to drive a supercar properly on a track. Be good to see his driving skills step up too.
I told ya Mat, you shoulda got one in RHD back home... now you see how much you miss the GT3!!!! get one, get one, get one!
You already know the redemption Porsche build is going to be crazy.
Id be pissed if i was freedy and you were having so much fun without me lol
Your Boy WaZ right Mat 😂😂😂There Nothing To talk About the Moon lmfao 🤣🤣🤣Bro The Purple 🟣 PorsheH Looks So Insane And Sounds Like Formula 1 🏎️💨💨💨 Broo That Manual Shifting IZ The WAy To Go For 🏁 16:55 😅That Traction control sheesh 🤙🤣🤣🤣 You were Spinning Like Mr Geigo 🦎😁🤣🤣🤣Im Impressed The way You Control The PorsheH " Master " 👑💪
Great video 👍🏾 … I don’t think anyone ever landed on the moon though 😂😂
Yes get a gt3 911 rs I told Damon off DDE to get one as well  Just imagine you dde on gumball 2024 driving GT3 RS
Matt it seems that your driving freddy's car on the wrong side of the road.. LOL!!! More vlogs to come for you brother..
Thanks for the laughs! Really needed them today.
Moonlanding was faked. xD
I borrowed a Porsche from Porsche hire (C4S) and I know I can’t afford it but I certainly dream about Buying one one day ❤❤❤
Need one in the UK
Freddy has got to the best guy ever. I was having a heart attack when you drove the Mclaren and then the Porsche as you've had some bad luck of late!!!
$1 says that P1 still has sand in it.
Re MOON LANDING  Ask the Russians who landed on the moon  Because if we faked it they would be the 1st ones to call us out on it   it was a space race don’t forget  USA v USSR It was the Cold War  they had a close eye on each other  They could tracked each other’s missiles  they knew we landed on the moon
The moon landing was faked
Theres more chance Freddies P1 gets to the moon than NASA ever will !
GT3 is the ultimate purist experience car and a must own for old school rev heads like myself! :D
There was no moon landing! Period.
Idk why you got rid or the gt3. That’s the only car I was low key upset about
Freddy is such a cool guy I am glad you found him and have this relationship with him. Can't wait for the next collab build you guys have.
Bro 2 supras and a Lamborghini just chilling in the garage is crazy
The biggest issue with a gt3 rs, is everycar after doesnt live up to it. I dont think even the mclaren you are building will bring the same smiles.
Mate they're trees left and right of you and grass just before them so no saving it or braking if she had properly let go......you have big balls my man 💪🏼
Safety first boys.
driving content was dope
Please take it back to the UK
Why not place tire blocks on the ramp before moving the car onto the lift ramp?
That 911 is perfection
Matt, its cheaper for you to move to the US and buy the GT3 RS back from Freddie;  we'd be happy to have you here.
Freddies going to watch the latter part of this video with his heart in his mouth!😂
my issue is if i get a porsche i dont know if i want it manual or automatic. it would be a car i would keep all my life. part of me thinks the manual will make this car fun to drive all its life but then again idk. so hard. any recommendation ?
All joking aside, my Grandfather worked at JPL, he developed systems on things like the Voyager probes and the Hubble telescope. He specifically worked on the camera systems... and in his old belongings we have actual photos, including negatives from the moon. In fact if you went to Disneyland and rode Space Mountain at any time from opening until it was refurbished in the early 2000's, then you would have seen some of my grandfathers photos on display along the exit line.
That GT3 needs to come home with you. LHD car in the uk. Meh minor detail.....
GT3 is so sexy!
Of course we landed on the moon!
No moon landing
Moon landing was a hoax . Why haven't they done it again if technology has advanced for so many years
moon landing never happened in reality, only in peoples imagination. motion pictures tend to make people believe false events as facts when they lack legitimate proof.
Did we vibe on the moon?
"When at home it's darker, colder and raining"  you lucky bas...rd.😂 Well done you deserve it 👍
I have seen each of your videos
How freaking cool ..the biggest car you tubers hanging out in one episode..no egos... awesome
Landing on the Moon and a fake moon landing don't need to be mutually exclusive.  Both can have taken place and i believe that is the truth.
Matt talking about a paper route made me think of the old video game 'Paper Boy'. 😅😅😅
The GT3 is the car that made me start watching your videos.
Looks like Adam LZs car lol😊
Hit up the triple f collection I bet they’ll let you drive their hypercars lol
why not look for a wrecked GT4RS ??
Go for the gt3
I would like to ask how much cost this car in America
Mat: I don't want to abuse it, It's Freddie's car.   also Mat: Lets slide it round the corner   hahaha
I want that car😂❤
so, the Russians have never disputed it..... i feel like they would know! so yeah, man has been to the moon.
Ask DDE Dave about the Manuel conversion. They did one to his 599. Was supper sick !
As a 20 year old,  lost the first car I ever owned (the first of many I couldn't really afford) to an overnight stay in the sea off the coast of north Wales. Spent more than a week of my holiday - all day, every day - trying to recover the car back to a drivable condition. The garage owner who rescued the car and so, so kindly (never forgot his generosity) let me use his yard to try and fix the car, warned me that no car that had been immersed in sea water could ever be rectified. But I persevered. It got us back to Hendon Way before finally dying. For ever. So good luck with yours. (River water is a different proposition. It's the sand, salt and ground up little animals that makes sea water so corrosive. It's like liquid sandpaper. Truly awful stuff as far as metallic surfaces and electrics are concerned.)
Nobody's been to the moon...ever !
That car is tuned perfectly!!!!  It sounds great 👍🏾 🔥
Sorry, but driving someone else's car like that is extracting the michael. You should be ashamed of yourself.
Pagani!
Rebuilds the car… asks how to turn it off🤣 brilliant🔥
No your uncle was a shill for the theft of 80 billion a year
My home Chicago!!!!
Go see the freedom factory and say Hi to Cletus and his 3000hp mullet
Part of me thinks oh my god you can make a bracket in a couple of minutes you god damn monkey   The other part of me thinks make the bracket and sell it to him
This channel is epic..
Mat I’m asking please help me with a new phone for my Christmas present please would mean so much bro please
Matt go to Texas they make all the parts to manual swap Ferrari's
If you like the sound of the roof inlet you should keep the cool hole.
We didn't land on the moon
The moon landing was shot on a movie set. But we will one day make it to the moon.
Such beautiful cars!
Should have kept the Porsche Matt loved that car. Pete
Brilliant.  👍👍
We never landed on the moon & the earth is flat.  Also no such thing as gravity. 🤫
Definitely a Porsche GT3 RS should be the 1 you choose to acquire
Hey mat and dad. I got a Suzuki escudo pikes peak in my garage. Its in a million pieces. Want to take it off my hands? Much love bro
I think the lunar landing is real. Also, please do find another Porsche GT3! Really awesome cars!
Hey Mat don’t forget your roots back in UK whilst you vibe in the US
That Porsche literally sounds next level
we landed on the moon. trust me, i was the moon
have you ever thought about finding a Koenigsegg, the Swedish monster car😮😮
acquire::   LEWIS HAMILTION purple crash car.
The Porsche is soo Matt's car..suits him perfect and he is happier in it.!!
Is it a Rs 6.5 now
We *NEVER* landed on the Moon That was nothing more than an American propaganda tactic directed towards Russia
The R6/7 gold wheels are amazing
Lets find this guy a crshed gt3 rs pleasee hahah
can you please put a rubber chicken in Freddy's suspension somewhere hahahaha
I’d part your hair for driving my car like that 😅  Freddy is too kind!
No moon landing it was done in a studio, conning yanks 😂😂😂
For a second i thought you will have to fix the porsche again 😂😂😂😂😂
We landed on the moon and came back to our SPHERICAL planet!!
Out of all the cars I watch you rebuild that GT3 is the one I love the most.
That Porsche is so f ing sick
Looks so much fun mate the way yous all work together always laughing and joking even when the rs6 engine  blew brilliant  mate always look forward to your videos
You definitely landed on the moon dude 😂 ❤ keep flying 💪🤟
Definitely never been to the moon, it's not possible now let alone 60 years ago
Has to be the best channel on facetube bar none, and he’s a local guy
This GT3 is hands down the BEST car I've driven. Grest job with the rebuild. Drives even better than factory with the alignment. Congrats on 2M subs on the main channel!
Great video as always, would for sure be nice with a GT3/ GT3 RS back at home in UK :D <3 Love from Sweden <3 <3 <3
koenigsegg as a Hypercar?
You can see the stuff left on the moon with decent telescope, and coordinates of landing sites for your self.
No. No one has
Next car a Daihatsu Trevis would be nice:)
Cars
We need to see all your cats
Can never go wrong with a Porsche .. that’s the goal 🥹 🔥
720S is a hypercar. Supercar = 0-60 in less than 3.5s, hypercar = less than 3s. 720S = 0-60 in 2.8s
I want that dream car also. Never had a Porsche but have been a huge fan since day one. Pops (rip) had a Porsche 911 in my baby room 😆  when car guys have kids eh 😆
I understand that hurt you feeling knowing you built that you will find one don't worry
This channel is my favorite. I love the background information.
haha, love your channel, Mat... been watching for a while now. I can for sure tell you, we've not gone to the moon--the whole thing was faked and barely a good fake at that. Also, check into the flat earth... lol. ;) We don't even live on a friggin ball... The lies run super deep down that bunny hole ;) Good day, mate! Keep up the awesome work!
For the record, we've never been to the moon!
Bloody love this! You got a hella cool car family going on! Sorry Tavarish, not convinced about the moon landing tho!! 😂
Yup, if you purchase one back in the u, k, you won't have to fly all the bits and pieces into the states in your luggage. To rebuild it you can just take good down the street and get them
Moon landing was definitely a lie it’s 385,000 klms away
According to JM, Porsche prices are due a serious dip so bide your time.
Quite ironic that there’s a brown stain on the floor as the engine literally shite itself 😂😂
Was a great fake the moon landing… made it work for a few decades but now the car & film of the take off and lack of dust from the thrusters … only Americans and under 10s can now believe it…
Porsche , there is no substitute.!!
Get it back
Matt, "lended" have you just made up a new word?
Super awesome videos champ. Reminds me of growing up in NYC in uncles shop amazing humor! Blessings ! Can’t wait to see you your gt3 build back home!
Eddie Izzard answered the moon landing once and for all for me.  The USSR were in a race with the US for the moon and had all the technology to see what the US was doing.  If it was fake the USSR would have INSTANTLY been shouting from all media that it was fake.
Hey Matt, moon landing is a go! Definitely happened!
Always makes me wonder why you gave the gt3 to tavarish
Yes, we have not been back because we were not the first humans. Put it this way, the first humans on the moon we're the same ones that caused 5000 men with all their hardware to retreat from operation HighJump in Antarctica. How do you debrief 5000 men from such an event? Give them a job. Months later, the CIA was born.
Bout time you treat yourself, you earned it.
Congratulition 500000 abo  go ahead and far beyond  good luck in the future
what is that porsche 918
Bet you regret letting that car go 😢
Can we have a car fleet update video! It’s been a while ✌️
Dear Matt, it is impossible that they put someone on the moon, because look at all the faults with Your cars, like the starter engine for instance..
you better get that GT3 RS!!!!!! YOU DESERVE IT
Freddy you need new tyres on that gt3 😂😂
5:18 I think Tom Hanks has soiled his seed a few years ago.
Mat, no seat bels, No brainer
Gotta love the GT3 ❤
Matt May God Continue Blessing & Guiding You & Your Family.
Mat video is like yfood to my brain that’s how I can’t go a day without watching matt videos 😉😌👏🏽💯
GT3 is insane your best build ever definitely need one back in the UK
Amazing I suffer from SAD in winter but I’m trying hard to come over it these vids really help with your vids would like a vlog of daily matt
Buy it back and auction it off in 'Merica! It's my only chance of winning one of your cars. 4:52
Moon landing was an inside job
That GT3 is one of the best sounding cars I’ve ever heard. It sounds like an F1 car with that exhaust.
Anyone else’s heart racing on behalf of Freddie when he was ragging the GT3
Probably did not land on the moon based on the information available 🧐 … my question is… does it really matter if we did or we didn’t?… It hasn’t benefited humans in anyway, but it has spent a bunch of their money while they’re mostly living paycheck to paycheck or struggling to put food on the table… That’s the truth! 😊
Matt should just move to the US. It's obvious he's meant to be here!
I SWEAR TO GOD I KNOW THAT HE WILL SAID PAGANI BEFORE HE SAYING IT, Because this car suits him 4:17
Oh man the sound that GT3 makes. Almost had to rub one out.
It's too bad you didn't keep the GT3 but at least you have a chance to drive it again. Freddies Charger Hellcat is very cool and the story behind it is even better.
BUY THE PURPLE PAGANI THAT HAS BEEN CRASHED THAT BELONGED TO LEWIS HAMILTON OMGGGGG!!
“SCARYSCARYSCARY    I DON’T LIKE THAT” TM       Mat Armsrtong  😂❤
Awesome as alwayz Happy Vibes,never no negativity bro,keep on pumping Matt,hope ya all well stay safe matey.😎❤
🆒😎👍!
No we haven't landed in the moon yet 😂😂
Yes please rebuild another porsche gt3 or something alike
Of course your uncle three times removed landed on the moon.🤣
I don't think they make a manual GT3 RS I thought they were all paddle shifters? The thing with Porsches is that the driving experience is just so good and pure. I used to think they were so over rated but then when you drive one you understand!
Great stuff Mat, im just happy to see a youtuber famous from Leicester 😂 Still remember your BMX days, glad to see you've grown so much in the car industry, cannot wait to see you grow even bigger 👀
Mat please try to make us happy twice a week I didn't sleep good with out your episode here in Africa in Namibia 🇳🇦 am an electrician but you're making me to foll in love with mechanic 🧰 😅
I love your builds mahn❤Love from South Africa 🇿🇦❤
Yeah, there's millions of research pages from NASA documenting the details of Apollo mission and others. Millions of pages. Try to fake that.
Just move to America
I liked my own comment
Mat I was going to ask what are those bits of string hanging from your dad's shorts, then I realised they are his legs
is this gt3 his car then or not
The cameraman's a real G. The way he hides the speedo by changing the angle when you go above 40 was so good....
Adam needs to drive it
You and your Dad plus family need to have a holiday home near Freddie house.
I think Mat maybe likes that GT3? Just a thought 😂
Matt's reaction to the GT3 going sideways gets me everytime 😂 what a machine!
Gt3 RS 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Moon landing = No  Simple fact is we wouldn't have stopped going if we had already been there. Everyone is going to chime in telling me that there was no political will or budget to return. The evidence that those people are all wrong is the International Space Station. Multiple governments with the political will and hundreds of billions spent. If we had the technology to land on the moon, remembering India and China's recent failed attempts, that would still only be half the task. Getting back off the moon and travelling back to earth.  Logic is that if we are still failing to land in the 2020's then there's no chance we did it in the 1960's
10:51 so heres the thing. There is a video of the first guy coming out of the moon lander. Where did the camera man come from who shot the guy coming out. Was the guy coming out the second ?
Haha!! Hell yeah we landed on the moon!!
Moon landing was a hoax
Once you have driven a good  911 Porsche there is no equivalent.
Love the way you treat a friend's car and abuse it like shit after all the help he's given you .
@Dave A German Youtuber just revealed he purchased a crashed GT3 and wants to rebuild it! A colab with him would be incredible! He´s a cool guy :)
Freddy’s hair about to turn white after watching this vlog 😂
Yup we need a gt3 rs rebuild project after the Ferrari and the 720
The gt3 is my favorite car
u are keep getting bigger and better in this journey. glad ur making it to the top 😍😍😍
Jack with flip flops on!
Another amazing video
Hey i just hit the 10k likes woot woot!!!
I say we landed on the moon, my wife says not! Many intense conversations had.
im confused, did he give his car away  to freddy?
Think we probably did go there at some point somehow, but broadcasting on live TV and risking a PR disaster.. yeah no. Luckily the deleted the tapes.
Please please PLEASE do a 918 if you ever do a hypercar. There’s a couple that have been totaled in the last year or two
No
Loving the videos but can we have an update on  the 720s
So did they land on the moon
Mats mission to find a gt3 or gt3 rs when he gets back, love the Porsche unreal car
Anyone got a name or link for the shirt/sweater he is wearing when getting in the GT3 at 11:30
Absolutely amazing seeing the trust Freddy has in you. Really love it. Been watching your channel since the beginning. Had some disbelief about Freddy and the P1 Hybrid story. But seeing you in the USA with the RS6 and how he’s supporting you gained my respect !!
The Sound of the Porsche, it's something else without even sitting in the drivers seat
Hope while you are in Orlando you can go over to the Kennedy Space Center. It’s less than two hours away.  They have a real Saturn V (5) rocket and space shuttle there. Maybe after you see them you will be more convinced we actually went to the moon. If you are still not convinced, we can get you fitted for a tinfoil hat and get you membership in the flat earth society🤪😂🤣
Ship the Porsche back to Britain then matt
What about your 720s ??👍🤔🤔
Mat Watson recently got himself a GT3
Great to see some more awesome content Matt, always nice to keep up with your journey and all the fun you and guys get to experience. Great to see you back in the GT3 and driving it like you stole it 😮😂😊
lol Freddy is not gonna like that driving xd
Great vid, but UK H&S would have a field day with both Jack in this one and Freddie in other vids wearing sandals while doing sketchy stuff 🤣🤣🤣
Thanks for the awesome content Mat. Killin it bro!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love the GT3!
i had no father since 2 years old...so i kinda envy u =)
Not a chance (moon landing) if we can do it now fair enough but we definitely couldn't do it way back when. But it made Russia look bad so 🤷
Mat the genuine starter have you brought it back to the UK as you can have it rebuilt, I know I had a few Starters fully rebuilt and Alternators in Leicester. CA Units - Auto Electrical
Should replicate the gt3 in the uk.
That was so cool 😎😎😎👍👍👍
How about a special with you skateboarding
Moon landing?
Mat so what you prefer the P1 or the RS?
Can someone explain to me why Matt sold the GT3???
Mat you and your fam are ultra cool, and the fact that you have the relationships that you have are epic. You will get to your goals! You make things happen bro!
DDE 720 GTR VS this p1 will be an amazing race
Moon landing still laughing 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Okay the dad is hilarious, "Okay, let's put it back in the garage and not finish it now."
Loose the ridiculous backward  caps.....that's so ancient dude
No moon landing😢😢😢 not even musk can penetrate the firmament 😂😂
I would say the moon landing was faked! Our government lied to us and they do it all the time and so does every government! 🤷🏽‍♂️
wait what
We did not land on the moon 😢
Did we just find out your pops name is Tony?!
Love the wee dmo dig haha
Might just be me, but I find it kind a good show of character to acknowledge other YouTubers in your videos. Didn't have to mention DDE, but you did, much kudos
Great vid love when the purp gt3 makes an appearance!
Please get a LHD changing gear and the position of the pedals and gear lever are always better in a LHD car.  Besides if you are right handed then it is the only way to go if you are serious about driving.
Look at the technology in the cars of 1969 and then think about how accurate the systems would need to work to land on the moon, take off again and then land back on earth. I am an engineer and I find it very hard to believe.
tavarish sticker on the gt3 laughing at you mr armstrong
I loose my mobile signal when I go to a different room in house, but Nixon was able to phone "Armstrong" on the moon from a landline.😂
no big hoax
So is AdamLZ still having a fit over this gt3?
Looks like a good time!
Sooo good 2 cu in GT3 ...🤙🇳🇿
No chance has man set foot on the moon. Its easier to be fooled than convince someone they've been fooled
Watch out for the sheriff.
🤘😎🤘
I really did believe , but Elon is showing us how hard it actually is to land a rocket……. So not sure
Hi
lended !! good England !! You not much edjamacated like what us is ! 🤣
Never landed on the moon 👍🏼
Not never Ireland 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
WATCHING FROM SOUTH AFRICA ❤in 🎉🎉
This is good stuff
Me personally, we did not land on the moon. I feel like we'd have more footage if we did IMO. 🤷‍♂
Hope your audi is Gunna be alright. Love from South Africa 🇿🇦. PS image bringing that car here in Africa.that car will sound mental here.
86k views and 19 likes 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ COME ON PEOPLE!!
The moon landings were as fake as a teenagers Instagram, and NASA tell more lies than the Bush & Clinton's combined
Just wait for matt watson to wreak his car 😬 😂
From memory adam LZ with his old gt3rs had grip issues due to repetitive high heat cycles on track, still lots of life left visibly but done and needed replacing
A Porsche 911 Turbo S would be sick, too. It's amongst the fastest cars in the world
3:40 WhistlinDiesel would already sell scraps of that ride.
You need to buy it back from Freddie save up and bring it home!
Ever since subscribing to Matt’s main channel back in December last year and seeing him grow and challenging himself definitely has helped me gain confidence when I’ve tried fixing my cars or my partners car and mums car because I know hard work beats talent 🙌🙌
Flip flops.  FFS. 😂
lmaoooooo @8:50 what'd they run over some geese? hahahahaha
The noise of that gt3 is fucking nuts
Research Flat Earth Eric Dubay
A manual gt3, what else can you need?
Oh your one of THOSE!. That still believe in the moon. *sigh* they are so cute when they are still naive. Lol!
People don't realize we didn't only go to the moon once. We went back several times n
I’d love to see some gt3/ rs content back home 👀👀
just found this other channel big up to the hard work   much love from kenya would love to join ur team
No to the moon landing 💯
hey mat can i ask what brand of board is used for the rs6 deck
Its funny you mentioned your last name - I always think of Tim Armstrong, Rancid frontman and one of the greatest lyricists ever, especoslly in punk rock. The astronaut is a fun one too haha.
The sound of the Porsche is addictive.
You and your channel pops up in so many different peoples streams lol. Car lovers all around the world recognize you as one of the best on the platform. I dont know what it is exactly, but you make some unique content. Keep up the awesome work, most of us wont ever get to drive or even look at most of the cars you, your friends and family get to rebuild. I know I wont, but seeing you build them, break them and drive them has genuinely become the next best thing for me personally lol. Keep up the awesome work.
The PPF on the GT3 was horrendous. Why did you choose such a crappy installer?
The word plane-t was written on all maps pre-1700s and it was understood to mean a small section of a vast plane.  The sun goes Around the world like the end of the hour hand.  Flat like and like a clock.
3 generations of my family have/are working for NASA; KNOW, Without a doubt, the moon landing was real!
Mat it doesn't need to be new 911, the older ones have louder sound and no rev limit from the videos i watched if im not mistaken
Let’s get this channel to 1 million now
What a monster😊 GT3❤ it
this is an old video mate
so I think your loyal US audience should have a raffle to win the GT3!!!
No! We didn't land on the moon! 🌖 Great content once again...cheers!
Mat Armstrong's dad's 3rd cousin's brother's uncle was Neil Armstrong.
I that Mr. Regular back there?
The p1 isn’t a hyper car it’s a hydro car. Well it was when it went for a swim
buzz aldrin "because we didnt go there"
lol great vids but narrr we dint go to the moon we went to space but no moon lol
Mat you should definitetly colab with Budda from Poland in the future. I love both of your guys content and i would love to see you boys do a colab. Keep it up love the content <3
Pdk GT3 wayyy better
I so wish that GT3 wasn’t so expensive to get back because even if you get another one back home it won’t be the same as that one.
10:57 YES🎉
Sema ? How old do you make videos
991 GT3 RS…inbound.😉
Freddie is a legend
Awesome vid Matt, As for which hypercar, has to be the 918
Moon landing was a hoax
mat what ever happen to the red one that was damaged
I am Buzz Aldrin. Second man on the moon. Neil before me.
We never landed on the moon, it was filmed in a studio. Watch the interview of when the “astronauts” returned, they were so embarrassed and uncomfortable. Elon has the Truth, that’s why he bought Twitter, to get the Truth out, it makes no sense to buy Twitter other than that.
There is a damaged Gt3 for sale in Italy.  Just search the Italian marketplace.
We've been to the moon, just not when and how it was portrayed to us. My opinion of course!
Why are the videos going backwards? Did I miss something? I swear we already seen you eork on your car prior to sema getting worked on...
Like I said time and time again, perfect time for my Sunday roast 🎉😂❤
It’s not a P1 3:13 any more it’s a P520 @ best😂😂😂
Doing that in flip flops is crazy
Another brilliant video 👌🏻
Defo they never landed on the moon,Nixon supposedly phoned them on a land line 😂😂
Blue McLaren's interior look like fresh plaster.
So I only need to pick up 6 paper routes to get an LFA? ...sweeeeeet
I agree. That Porsche is without a doubt the best car you’ve rebuilt. I’d love to see another one someday on your channel.
If Neil and crew were anything like you and crew, then the moon landing was a good joke😅
I want another GT3 build
Keep them coming matt and no we didt land on the moon
Sorry answer is no we have not landed but they have bought NASA and all the Masons that have said they were there
Can’t believe your grandpa landed on the moon.. 🌙 😅
You should rebuild or buy a 992 GT3 RS ( with the weissach package) and please put a 718 Cayman GT4 RS engine on the Cayman s (with also the gt4 RS weissach body) and also change the Cayman s stickers and upgrade the interior
Way too much fun. Congratulations on the 2 million sub mile mark, next step,3million and a hyper car. You got this.
Freddy what a great dude that guy is
We almost got a rebuild series on this car again when the TC was turned off 💀😂
Come on guy we’re so close 500k subs
U should try a 911 Turbo S
I really was surprised you left it over there once you finished the repairs, but I understand why.
Yes, we landed in the moon. But some of the footage was staged. Maybe because of things that were found or seen that was not meant us to see, due to national security.
, no, i never landed on the moon,
Cool vid, good to see you twating about in Porsche! 🤣 Also great to the see the trust Freddy puts in you, lending you his toys and his workshop, that's what cars are all about, fun times and good people! 🙂
Definitely didn’t land on the moon
You should ditch the crappy uk and all its idiotic regulations/taxes
LEWIS HAMILTONS OLD ZONDA HAS BEEN SMASHED UP IN WALES
Need to go one bIgger now with a GT3 RS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m going to buy you a true flashlight…..
If you want a manual you can only get a GT3 as the RS is PDK only.
Thank you so much Matt’s dad called it…. Let’s push it to the back of the garage and not finish it. It’s been to the show
Good day mate
I landed on the moon yesterday so this is the end
You guys have given me the inspiration to get out and fix up my 90s civic del sol :)
Nobody has landed on the moon lol
We never landed on the moon. Sorry 🤷‍♂️
We can not leave the earth.
Everytime I watch one of ur vids I just larf and smile so much. Brilliant as per!!! 🫡
were off to button moon we follow mr spoon button moon
We absolutely didn't land on the moon. Just like they said Pizza gate for a conspiracy now the left ones again bows there heads since the FBI came out revealing the truth.
I think that if someone Crashes 992 GT3 RS then you should rebuild it and keep it, it would be awsome
the moonlanding has to be the biggest hoax of the century. 51 years ago they claimed they have landed on the moon(6th landning ) and have not returned since then (with all the technology improvements in suits, rockets etc and whatever)... i dont really believe it with the basic technology they had back then... its all a big cover up.  sending people(and the dog laika) out in space YES, moonlandning a big NO
👍
We absolutely landed on the moon, my guy. 😂
We are waiting to get your own GT3 RS. Maybe it will be your first car to have from factory and not buy in crush/dameged condition!
we never landed on the moon its all bs lol
Moon landing was fake. Faked to beat the Soviets?
Ey Mat. Do you know if the R8 in the back of Freddy's shop is for sale?
Yes, America went to the moon, there are aliens there.
Ferrari Ferrari Ferrari !!! Come mat new video I am waiting
Theres no way we landed on the moon
F@#king loon 😂 joyrider
Was that a hint.. Matt is moving to America??
corgi kappa the MOON is not real made of Metal (spiritual source )
Rolling your $2M hyper car off a truck wearing flip flops 😂
So cool to see you driving back this Beast...such a vibe! (((( ))))
We the fans of Matt Armstrong don’t need fancy thumbnails    We get notifications and bang we are on it 👍👍👍🇬🇧🇬🇧🇺🇸🇺🇸👌👌
The GT3 is just the best drivers car!!! Simply awesome! Need to get a UK spec one Mat!
The more tattoos people have, the less I can watch their videos.
Gotta rebuild a GT3RS Matt!!😅😅
matt you need to talk freddy in to bring car trek to the uk and they have to have 80s hit hatches and you need to me a new member of the show
The guy that said it’s no longer a hyper car is correct without the hybrid system it’s not a P1 it’s just a McLaren
Goat
That's your imagr
"will it fit?" Well mat... Sometimes it does, sometimes is doesn't
American here: NASA said that they put a camera on the outside of the lander that filmed the astronauts. Celluloid film of the 60s would disintegrate at moon temperatures.
Time to sell a few cars and look out for a porsche gt3 in the uk needing rebuilt. Give you more content
I would lay under the tires before I'd let a P1 fall off a ramp...
little did he know at that time, later on that he will buy a new engine for the RS6 and break the starter twice
No we did not land on the moon 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂now that’s funny respect GGG-unit
Lent 😉
Just love that Porshe
Smoke and mirrors mate.... Youre telling me we had the tech to go to the moon back then... destroyed it... And cant figure out how to remake it to get back to the moon... 😂😂😂
A cigarette boat would be perfect. Hammond's "Jizzle Drizzle" would be a candidate...lol
It's soo lovely that matt has Hannah's pic on his lock screen ❤ man I to remember mine but she is gone 😢
Your camera guy is mad disrespectful of other people’s property. Type of guy to smash up a car that was lent to him and laugh
I'm in florida I have been watching you channel and I love to come help fix cars
Ok, so you mod a transatlantic  boat to be powered by the GT3, and simply drive it to the UK. what could go wrong???
You should move to america
I haven't been following the channel long, perhaps I'm completely incorrect and you already have such skills, but I think you would benefit greatly from learning basic fabrication. Welding and machining and such. A couple times I've seen you trying to find a part that you could easily make yourself with a press brake and a cheap welder. I know that's kind of like telling a chef they should learn to farm, but welding and machining isn't very hard to learn.
Oh U wiseguy Mat, were u the one going by me in the Hellcat limo last night, look at the Guy with Turnt up Viiiiiibes in a left hand drive Gt3 ??  Happyyy Holidayzzz Motor Head  Mat!! @TopGear @KevinEstre  @IMSA  @PorscheRaces  @goonzquad1
Freddie is definitely one of your best friends ... I sometimes wish you never sold the Porsche but I understand why considering it drives on the wrong side and shipping for England. What a pity
never landed on moon no
Space isn't real!
Wanna buy board no shipping to Florida
nope they definitely faked the mood landing lol
Bro tavarish winning in life fr that 675 is beautiful😮‍💨😮‍💨
My middle name is Armstrong...
I agree Mat. If I had FU money. Would never buy Ferrari, lambo, Porsche. Would be a Zonda. I’d also rather build a crazy jspec 1000+ HP over any Ferrari or lambo.
Hey Mat can i please get the white shirt you rode in with the GT3 i like it alot
With Tavarish, yes on the moon. For clarity the Earth is not flat. You need a V12 project next.
M: “know what I mean?” M2: “do you know what he means?” T: “no 👁️👄👁️”
typical English, just can't help but be outside when it is sunny out.
Matt I won't lend you my car. Ever. lolol.
The Armtrong Army needs no Tumbnails , we watch anyway Mat 👍😄
Love with GT3 ❤ what a car!!!
You need to get behind the wheel of a gt4, if you love the gt3 you’re going to die for a gt4
Amazing stuff  Any updates on the audi??
Man all of you gotta get with LZ and TJ and have the 911s together 🔥🔥🔥
The moon landing was filmed in a studio
We knew this was the 1 who got away!😢
Love it you should definitely get one a home mat love you 😊
Buy youre dad a car then rebuild it for him love from S.A
Moon Landing? Fake AF
I’m sure once the 720”s is done, a GT3 or GT3 RS will make its way to the channel👍🇬🇧
Maybe sit outside mat Watson gaff in a 70's land rover and have a " small shunt" with his gt3rs😮
PLEASEEEEE GET A GT3 RS FOR THE CHANNEL ‼
Excitement when that notification pops up on Official and MK2 channel! Although, seeing the intro about whether the Audi can fit when I watched it get a new engine isn’t very exciting! 😂😂😂😂😂 Feels like this should have been a BEFORE!
Mate put all your efforts into buying a GT3RS rhd in England
imagine believing in the moon.
Now let’s have 2 million on this channel

Hi mat! I like your youtube channel! I don't know if you'll see this, I don't know if you want, and I don't know if you can, but I'd really like you see you restore an old porsche, like 1970s/80s or another mercedes!
It sounds like you’ll be relocating to the USA to me 😎
Moon landing didn’t happened 😂👌
What was that monkey dance after writing on the car
Hi mat! I like your youtube channel! I don't know if you'll see this, I don't know if you want, and I don't know if you can, but I'd really like you see you restore an old porsche, like 1970s/80s or a newer lamborghini model
Matttt❤❤❤

Hi

Amazing stuff, Mat. The self-knowledge and desire to rebuild high-end cars that the manufacturers themselves rather write-off ! I've been here day one, lad, and will support these videos you release so you go down as a "proper rebuild legend"
Buy it back
I'd like to see you and vice grip garage come together to resurrect a classic! Two of the most positive minded people in existence. 😎
Flipflops 😂
Buy back the GT3!!
Interesting
Mat your journey with building cars from  on a drive way to all the way round a world is amazing. Don’t stop what you do and believe in your dreams to get the mercilargo with problem free😂   Congrats on 2 million❤
