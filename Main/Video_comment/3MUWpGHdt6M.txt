I uest to watch you on YouTube that is for a while the came back and haven’t stopped keeping up
You've by far got the best set up out of the Sidemen!
What monitor do you use?
It's still time to Smash it apparently
This is the best room in the world
The black wall, where did u get the panels from
12:33 HE CAN NOW ADD THE PLAYBUTTON!!
I'd be happy with just a simple low budget pc🤣🫂
Yo Broski @Miniminter Keep It Up Mate Great Work On Your YouTube setup Bro 😎 0:42
Prime is crap.. and i get it at 50p a bottle at my local shop as he can`t sell it for love or money apparently.... he begs me to take it off his hands
my favorite part abaut it is the prime fridge
Where to get the shoe rack thingy
GORGEOUS
1:04
Would you say you have the better setup ??
Get a x box series x
Shout out @Ashville
Where can i buy that fridge
Wow best setup ever 😍😍❤️💯
vikks better this is lit tho!!
🥶
Does anyone know what camera Simon uses?
That poster of I think juice wrld on the planet is sick.
Simon: guys stop the KSImon memes. Also Simon: 5:03 I’m used to having KSI in my mouth.
Where can I get that rack where you got your shoes on display
Best setup
chair on carpet is fine with replacement roller blade wheels. they work on all surfaces, clear ones so they don't leave any marks and they are smooth as butter.
Can we get a house tour?
Where can I got the shelves he has his shoes on?
ngl i always have a smile when i watch these vids W set up
Who built it????
Awesome setup!!
iwl just happy for Simon 😊
How is talia attracted to this dweeb ? He’s so cringe. $$ buys you a wife these days. Insane
Wat 10 years of hardwork, grind, n sucking off jj gets u. Good on u simon
What editing
Bro how many Playbutton have this Guy?😂
what was the name of his mini fridges?
We love you minister

Build some muscles Man be fit
Go to the gym bro
Bro you got so much prime
My setup is better
Thanks to talia, con and vis 🎉🎉🎉    ashville 🚮
Ok ROOM and FINAL edit is PERFECT✨ SOME shelves COULD BE better 🫠       SHOES are DEAD💀 except DIORS ❤️‍🔥 PLEASE fix PRIME colours in fridge ❄️  THEY dont MATCH 😒 MUSHU is cute 🥹 TALIA on couch is not BAD too 😈
This is so fire 🔥 bro!
Bruh big ups to Talia on designing the room and Konstantin for the setup, this is completely 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm an architect and well done with the space usage and it looks very well done
Here for JJ's comment.
Amazing setup but I wouldn't trust PCSpeacilist, spent 3.5k on a fully kitted gaming laptop, just for them to put a re-branded 1990's motherboard in it, can't play a large selection of games because of no tpm 2.0
You came to look at jj comment 🤡🤡
POV: you are searching for KSI's comment
My man's winning in life
Set up looks sick! my one suggestion would be to have the shoes facing each other in the boxes, I think it might look even cooler? just my opinion :)
what was your budged?
6:50 someone please tell me where to get the shoe boxes from
Where do you keep all the wires please?
ngl unsubbed

Happy for you
This was visually very pleasing
Where did you get the 3d hexagon panels?
that dog has a really human face wth
You boys have lived your dreams already now make some other peoples come to reality 😢
idk why but when simon said what do u want u little dog it was funny
I don't even know who this guy is but he popped up in my suggested and DAMN I must say his set-up is super clean.  Love it!
Is it just me? but the shelves empty make the room bigger. Less is more they say. Mainly the mirrored shelves.
What colour was Harrys butt. NO CHEATING ;)
This was inspiring to watch - well done!
The transitions at the end though😮💀
“ohhhhhhh i know, i’m thirty” had me going 😂
no
This setup is soooo sick 🔥🔥
Lovely setup Simon, great work by everyone. The transitions at the end though 👌🏽
One of your best vids yet, can't wait for the diamond play button one! 🔥
⌨️Oooh where does he live?
lit ep.
Does anybody know if Kons gets paid for doing all these setups ? Or is his payment the video he gets to record?
You are 30 years old geezer, I'm livin good bro, you are 30 years old, buying trainers in the wrong size to put on a wall, having a gaming room, 30 years old, fridge full of a crap high calorie energy drink, 30 years old, ksi's wood in your mouth, 30 years old, you are literally 30 years old fella, time to grow up.
3 years later talias gettin brucked up by a man
WOW, Miniminter's setup is sick, it's awesome, I can't wait to see content he uploads on YouTube and on Twitch from this New Place, Thank you to Talia, Kon, Viz and each of the supporters who helped make this possible for Simon👏🏾😁👍🏾
ohh. is its viks house
I just realized me and you have the same exact computer background what are the odds!!
you aint seen my Van setup if then bby
unofficial opinion!  miniminters set up> ksi's set up
8:01 You're doing 'O Fortuna - Carmina Burana' dirty with that one...
How the eff is this nerd a millionaire
Please put the prime in this spot it works so well and the sidemen bear in the bottom left corner would look so good then the Pokémon ball in the top right corner would look so good (sorry I really enjoy interior designing I want to do it when I leave school at the end of this year) thanks so much Simon
The best office I have ever seen
ngl it’s refreshing not seeing someone go thanks to you guy for all this at the end of the day he’s still had to work for it and and been doing for years
that dogs face, streight up reminds me of josh
did Asheville do this?
My old girlfriend JJ
Finally a video that does not involve rating prime
Where did you get those black tiles on the wall?
Beg you put a cap on that camera by the tv hahaha!
awesome
Awesome
Replace the boxing glove with a golden gauntlet and then it's complete
Look fire fr 🔥🔥🔥
Does anyone know where he got that Arcanine piece from? It’s amazing
We will make it one day boys😂
Sidemen Slurps sounds so suspicious 😂
Thanks for doing the "Harry", would had lost me marbles.
Where did you get your juice wrld canvas ?
Suggestion for the shoe wall don’t use the black shoe because you can’t see it well with the black wall.
Wasnt Ashville supposed to design the office?
This is the dream man
I LOVE this set up SO much that I just recreated it in Fortnite LOL!
this is the best setup i've ever seen, just perfect
His setup is worth more than my net worth
pretty much just a prime advert
13:21 13:21
Yes it is the best setup out of sideman.
The camerman needs to stop moving so fast
7:56 Wedgeman Wines or Lanky Wines
7:03 Is that Josh edited on the face or am I just seeing things? Edit:I paused it. It was definitely Josh
The next room tour we'll probably end up having, Simon will be buying an actual house after having a mini minter with Talia
Just bragging about everything costing so much money? Yeah great stuff mate👏🏼
Room is looking SO sick! You're gonna have the best time creating content here
This 1 year ended really fast
Damn this is crazy, it looks sick
Bro legitimately the best set up ever sad that not everyone has this much money to spend on great things
Your mother has joined Misfits Boxing. How does this make you feel?
Did Ashville do the build
you just dissed Ethan, KSI and Vikk by saying I'm not going to show all the rooms of my home 😂
Is it just me or do all these "dream setups" look so painfully generic.
Simon!!! For your prime fridge, get some spring loaded vendor slots so when you take on another pops to the front, ease of access and will keep it looking all flush too 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
The best setup I’ve ever seen, and I’ve seen some gems.
Get a stream deck pedal for the sofa streams
personally my favorite out of all the sidemen
Sent me prime pls
Would be able to put the link up for what under desk pc mount you got?
every youtuber cameraman obsessed with : zoom in/zoom out //// CRINGE!!!
Bro was talking about being minimalist 😅
no shout out for Ashville for making the room?
wheres that  couch from? Looks comfy
looks mental!!!
Did Asheville do the room ?
Fight fire with fire. They stole,they killed. Fight fire with fire.
A dream gaming room, just shows you what money can get
Yo this setup is prolly the best one I’ve ever seen
Hi Simon please can you do a video showing us your full shoe collection? Many thanks
"I'm used to having KSI in my mouth"💀
Tobby,Harry and Ethan need to do theirs next
Shouldnt you get something on the wooden floor so the chair doesnt ruin it?
Pink prime??? Since when
didn’t ashville do the building work
I'm so HAPPY about your new amazing setup SIMON you have definitely come along way and deserve this a hundred percent I just recently moved to my brand new high rise apartment and I deserve it too definitely I've come a long way and have had ups but mostly downs in my life and the fact you got your setup the same time as me moving in to my brand new APARTMENT just shocks me haha cause I've been watching you for ages now you have truly inspired me to be a better person your an amazing human and a YouTuber good luck with your future endeavours Simon with your channel and with the SIDEMEN much love from AUSTRALIA🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🎉🎉🎉
finally another set up to make a react video and tier list video.

Edits 🤌
Do we get to see talias set up ?
clean
he finally made it, after struggling so hard for the past year.
Congrats minister 🎉
Anyone else notice them 2 dancing on the shelf at 5:46
Simons reminds me of Roman Atwood
By far the coolest setup I have ever seen honestly is a dream setup for anyone
Simon's casting couch really coming along
What kind of a nonce puts shoes that he's worn in a display cabinet?
🤯🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is my dream set up, looks so awesome simon and big up kon, talia and viz for making it look sick.
that is way too sick
Why not on mhmm7?
looks unreal 🔥
Guess who paid for this. Subscribers. If he didn't have a YouTube channel he wouldn't have this.
Damn the transitions at the end go dummy hard! Great editing!
🔥
I’d never leave
The editing at end 🫡🤌🤌
Beautiful.
Lovely video
I don’t know if lachlans is better than this or not
the box to your weeding ring in the little boxes in the back
Simon got that camgirl setup for his watch alongs lol
How’s Woldingham treating you?
This has to be the best setup on youtube rn
must be nice having MONEY MONEY. deffo the best sidemen setup by a mile icl
The nut room
was I ur 1mil view cus it was at 999k then I clicked on then it went to a mil
I just made it 1 millll views 🔥🤣🤣🤣
Shoutout ashville
I cant get over how good this setup is. Talia and Kon smashed it
Love that you addded yourself to a Chicago billboard.. watching from chi-raq
surely with the shoes, the flat shoe is in the front and the one on the angle is at the back?
Honestly , Simon deserves the best ❤️
Mushu is soo cute
your setup is insane
i really watched a man put stuff on shelfs for 12 minutes…
The setup, immaculate.  The editing, unmatched 🔥🔥
8:01 ahhaaa owhhaa ahhhh a ahhh
Vic’s shirt is fire😍
the editor went nuts 12:07
Put some sides waffle fries on the shelf
That set up is 50% electric bill
WHY AREN’T YOU A VEGETARIAN ANYMORE? 🥲🪓🔪🪓🔪🐓🐄🐖🔪🪓🔪🪓🔪
globe in the extra wall space??
gone clear
Ong we need a prime x sidemen
Josh's face on the dog
I don't know why I thought Simon was wearing prisoner uniform
This is the best YouTuber set up I’ve ever seen, also the sneakers are too cleannn
I thought from the thumbnail that this guy was in jail
Wow this set up is probably the best I’ve ever seen. This was crazyyyy
The way he said "room" in this video is a bit weird or is that just me.
Comment for attention 🙂
The Josh edit on Mushu is nightmare fuel lol.
7:18 Mushu doing a tiny trot behind Talia in the background 💖
Where's he keeping the Red Bull?
I barely comments on a set up video, but this is perfect🔥
Craziest thing ever is I could just live in that room alone :/
Only 96k off 1M on podcast
I love You Bro
Yo these ksimon jokes he buss left and right were funny af. 😂😂
Hands down the coldest looking setup I've ever seen
Where does he get the shoe display boxes from
What happened with the ashville build
so much money?bro i can literally go to walmart and buy me some prime for 1.99$ 😂 you extra man
OMG HE'S JUICE WRLD FAN  MY TYPE DUDE😇👊
I'm actually in awe of how amazing this setup looks. Congrats on how far you've come Simon 👏
Leave that empty bottom left shelf for fan Art !
This was crazy and the montage at the end was insane!
Bros got more YouTube plaques than I’ve got friends
O
Don’t watch my videos this comment I bet Will not be won’t have 100 likes😂
Viks is still better
How come Simon gets the sidemen plaques?
7:03 Oh hey Josh
this is sickkk, proof right here that money buys some happiness lol
Talk about the definition of a hypebeast 😂
those flashes in the edit were smooth
This room in general is so so sick. Love the cool items and everything
nah bro 💀, they did josh dirty here 7:05 . mad💀
Why was he mocking JJ's sound in 8:02?
Where's the sound equipment? Please don't tell us you're listening through your TV speakers
smashed it 🔥🔥
Mad setup. Talia's brain is just full of creativity.
The setup is actually so clean 🥶
And I want the setup
It's soooo nice!
Its crazy that you can just visit the sidemen. I personally wouldnt go to the UK just to say hi to them since its not a good enough reason. would go if we made a Video together but even this is financially impossible for me 😂. Ey but happy to see your New home, Simon!! 👍
Where is your old flat
Huge W btw👌👌👌👌 but put 1 of your shoes on you collection facing backwards
Best set-up out of all the Sidemen.
Finally, a quality video so I can eat my food.
man thats sick can i please get a ksi prime orange mango
7:04 is cursed
The school photo 💀💀💀
use the ksi adidas shoes
Bro I cant unsee Josh on mushu's face
This is definition of a “Dream Setup” 😁😁
We made the right people famous
If Simon ever gets robbed it’ll be for all the prime he has
#4 on trending
5:06 🤔simon's missing jj too much
Look fire🤩 Imagine Simon gets robbed😭😭
7:04 did Josh very dirty 😂😂😂😂
SICK
Kons vid has more views 🤣
im sorry, but that sofa to tv table are too close.
maybe a soundbar missing from the tv? and i think you pretty much done! nice setup!
Smashed it! Sickest setup I’ve seen 🔥
Pov:earthquake Feliz navidad
Remember that the Lord Jesus Christ died on a cross for you because He loves you so much. He then rose up from the dead three days later The Ten Commandments are called the moral law, (most of us are lying thieving blasphemous adulterer at heart and deserve hell) you and I broke the law, Jesus paid the fine. That’s what happened on that cross.  By believing that Jesus died on the cross and rose up from the dead 3 days later and not just confessing your sin, but also repenting of all sin you have done and putting all your trust in Him in prayer, He will grant you everlasting life as a free Gift.
What sofa is that???? Looks comfy AF
12:08 kudos to the editor! excellent cinematic shots and the transitions are just WOW!🥶
setups in 2023.. cmon bruder..
You need a more modern door
11:25 Talia got violated 😭
you need some shoes with a bit more colour
It's so gamery
Some mad transitions in the end
Ashville did a great job on the reno! Looking cleeeeeeean
nice.
Gonna be one expensive electric bill
looks unreal. All the money these precious fans give you to by an ikea media unit
7:15 wow chouchou
That josh morph on mushu's face was mad at 7:05 Edit: timestamp
11:30 😂😂
can i have ur old pc?😭😭😭
I was waiting for the ball from sideman charity match
Best Setup out of all the sidemen🔥🔥
This is just and idea n it might be stupid y don’t u stream a what’s good podcast on twitch?
Wout Weghorst
You should put the old sidemen book in the box with the boxing glove
Where are the clear shoe boxes from?
12:10 Who let him cook 🔥🔥🔥
He did a vid the other day in this setup ?
Millionaire things you know
Is it just me or does he still have the skull at 9:58 after he said he’d given it back to Kon? Quickly disappeared after as well
Red headsets Simon can never be topped! Jokes asides this setup is amazing
Yayyyyy! So happy for you Simon!!!
It looks so fucking good, Talia did absolutely phenomenally with the design looks sick as
Yeah big up Kon, Viz, Talia and Simon ofc, beautiful work ❤️
probaly yh
I think this very cool!!!
Looks epic
This setup is my dream
Konstanking
Sick
definitely beats the attic lookin room with the slanted roof
The lighting above the tv set-up is fucking amazing
Best sidemen setup and it's not close
what about you give us the specs of the pc ?  have you considered it ? xD
Okay this setup is too clean, Kon's done a madness 🔥
7:04 bruh, I can't haha
7:10 mushu running from talia 7:18 mushu running at talia in backround
Well done Simon
Thanks for the moneyyyyyyy
567k views is trash
Matching Dior shoes 🤝
Did anyone find the edit of this video a bit nauseating? There was too much going on…
Waiting for pewdiepie to rate now
5:01 the genuine moment he asked “you want one” to the camera man 🔥🔥
NOT YOUR BDSM ROOM
Simon’s biggest flex in this video is the stupendous amount of prime he has at his disposal
why does josh live with them now though
MINIMINTER THE GOAT!!!
bro took 14 Years
the dog is just josh
5 mein ek ladka tha Jungle sq ft Ko nahin ab mujhe gussa ho gai please bhai mausam ki main aap Bajrang uska
I loved simons partial facial hair
The way both Simon and Talia reacted the same way at 11:30 shows they really are a good match 😂
the shoe holders look great without the lids on
Siko transitions
6
I can’t lie , Simon has a better setup than KSI😭
by far the best set up I have ever seen🔥
bros saying room as roum
Instead of the boxing glove why not put the custom supreme bear that Tobi gave you
Bro has a casting couch cam 💀
Guys did you not see Josh's face in Mushu's face🤣🤣🤣
Plot twist: simon moves houses so much just to be able to do tour of the old ones
More than 2 monitors = fail.
Honest dub
Nice Video 😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Absolutely love this vid! Good mix from the usual vids and the setup is sick! Congrats, you’ve earned it🔥
Ayy who put josh's face on mushu🤣
Money can’t buy personality
ksi is fat
Gay
gimme prime
it looks so sick!! you should put the jj shoe on the shoe wall as well!
Ending got me dead “pullin a Harry” 😭
Not having a window is maaadddd
This is my lanky millionaire sex offender 🥺 Super cool to see how far you've come. You and the Sidemen have done a madness
Simon could do Sidemen reacts on the sofa
Simon should get the Juice WRLD figure , i think it would fit so well in there
u should make a vid about reacting to tik tok comments that @ you
Your dream setup is complete and it’s giving me major inspiration. Can’t wait to see what you do next! 👀🤩
Simon : Pulls put a Pokeball..  Also simon : *I know..I am 30* 💀
❤
With that setup I would barely come out the house
R.I.P OLD SIMONS OFFICE
Epic setup brother
He is the only person who can proudly and happily mention his ex-girlfriend again and again
This is probably my favorite setup iv ever seen. Actually functional and really cool!
Let me plug em @ashville
The mags need to go where the dior's are that will look better
Where’s my our 10 mil plaque
Oofttt
Mashallah
hi
Shout out whoever edited this those transitions were fucking clean
just how many dream setup u have?
It’s cool but the wall behind the couch has to be the most useless wall I’ve ever seen
best sidemen set up fax
Is no one gonna mention the mags
This guy is jus too sick
white oreos 👀
Love the casting couch set up
I would never live this room
Prime are on clearance for $0.50 cents here because no one wants them
12:00 Simon casting couch video coming soon
HD casting couch now
That’s why he’s the GOAT
Please hide the taskbar on the side monitor over by the couch or get translucent TB. The white strip looks so bad. Love the setup otherwise
the juice poster🥺
Wow thats the best set up right there. Talia did a fab job with the interior design and i dont believe for one minute that somebody didnt have a tape measure handy to take the perfect measurements 😂
The amount of play buttons you have is actually absurde, it is a testament to the hard work you have put into youtube.
That’s looks great that fridge shouldn’t be on carpet tho
how many times has he completed this set up lmao
Loving the interior and decor. I suggest swapping the back shoes to face the other way though.
Nah the shoe wall is a bit too cringe...
You asked him if he wanted a ksi prime and he said yes and you grabbed one out the fridge and drank it😂😂
This setup is actually so sick!
Time to get a Sidemen Slurps Neon sign
Ngl think the set up would be better if the TV was central
7:04 they put josh face 😂😂😂😂😂
The set up is a w for sure🔥🔥💜
Miniminter is the goat that’s it
That's the best set up I've seen
woulda been good to have shown on the screen the specs of the new pc at 4:40
So fucking cool man
Looks great Minister 🎉
can’t just call it a setup more of a man cave but honestly the setup is unreal
Please do reacts and sit on the couch :)
simon and whistlindiesel have the same nice workboots
if you read this simon if you are going to be streaming twitch on the couch why don you swap out your twitch playbutton for the one that is in the camera's shot? loved the vid though i watch your twitch when i can and hope your doing  good.
Bro is way too rich
Simon should put the KSI X adidas shoes on his collection (my ideas cost a case of prime any flavour)
Nah sick video but whoever is the editor for this channle is doing a phenomenl job
Only Harry can pull a Harry
That casting couch tho…
How many play buttons do you have?!? I counted 15 😮
Better setup/gaming room than JJ's
Awesome set up. I'm more impressed by them Nike air Mags!
Missing something about Leeds. Few kits or just a logo
Really happy for you Simon ❤️❤️❤️
10:14 Where is this moment in Kon's video?
“Moving out with my girlfriend , KSI, and moving in with my fiancée, Talia” - Simon Minter
Put a bearbrick on the smallest space on the bottom
That’s the same jumper he wore for the old flat tour
ayy shoutout Chicago 7:58
To think his next up after this one will be even more mad!
When the primes worth more than the house
Needs some plants!
Soooopooo
The only word to describe this is ‘sick’
No shoutout to Ashville?
I'd love to see him do movie/series reactions with talia or anyone else since he's now got the sofa and tv in there
ngl imagine a prime named "Mini Mint". Would be disgusting but a fire name tho.
Guys there are probs more people that would brake in his room fore the prime than fore the shoes
Not even 1 shout out to Daniel Ashville
For the money 😭😭
The edit!!!!
Nah the room is sickkkk
0:46 Centrepoint?
where did u get the fridge from i really want that for my setup
An attack on titan final part watch along would be cool
WOOOOOOOOOO
last bit reminded me of harry's "gimme the fuckin money"
I will never understand the idolization of shoes, they're just fucking shoes, meant to be worn, to get them dirty, and once they're wore out, throw them away and buy the next ones.
Simon, any chance I could have one of each flavour, please and thank you
im size 7 can i have it 😝
You can have all the lights and upgraded PC’s mate but the red headset setup will never be topped
For that random space on the left side - what about that custom bearbrick that Toby got you?
I wish I had this set up
Shoes look so much better without box’s plz dont put the boxes back on - they degrade teh whole look of the setup and look soo cheap and tacky
Watchalongs on Twitch, especially football would be sick
Please bring Tobi for a football watch along
Your setup is so lit
The montage is so smooth and music perfect
Day 65 of begging for a Talia onlyfans
Anyone else kinda curious on what simons bills go up to
Crazy how far we’ve come since fifa back in the day man
Your Welcome. For the money.
I can’t not picture Mushu as Josh since someone said it
My mind went to a dark place when he should the couch angle at 11:49 😭
Maybe you could put your wedding day Photo in One of the free slots. Sick Setup btw
You have more prime than Asda and Sainsbury’s combined and I’m still over here yet to find a bottle haha mostly because I don’t wanna fight a bunch of kids and money hungry dads for it before it runs out 😂😂😂
The editing at the end went hard
The edits on this video are crazy
he not showing the house cause of the sex dungeon
For the love of god, cover the camera sensor 💨 Setup is fire 🔥
Must be nice to be a friend of KSI and get unlimited prime 😐
No @thisisashville  shout out ?:))
i love this set up! Well done to Talia for the design. Simon keep killing it bro!
No video ideas???
I cant unsee josh’s face on mushu now 😭😭
why jordz stopped appearing on the channel?
This is honestly the best setup ever
This is the dream room of a teenager lol
Finally…
This is so cool no cap 🤌🏽
He should put a kaws bear where the teddy bear was
RIP legend who will get married 😢
Bro the editing at 12:11 jeezzzzz
Wayy better then jj’s
Now were talking minter
So now we wait for Pewdiepie's roast
You inspire me
Alot of stuff from the old flat you need to take to the new house, those pictures w Talia surely you need to take! Great vid
Kon’s video couldn’t keep my attention long enough 😅 I’ve been waiting for this tbh😂
3:49, aaaa.... Simon, care to explain!🤣
so sick !!!!
Top work from Asheville who you forgot to mention
That truly is an amazing setup. Congrats to all involved. It's a masterpiece.
So glad my Juice Wrld painting made it! 🔥🔥
What’s the song ?? 12:24
Dope video, best vibe for a setup video. Loved seeing the overall process with just the right amount of depth and no filler content Moo Shu is adorable <3
What about the sidemen you put the charity game match ball from the 2016 hattrick in your wall?
I’m just surprised there isn’t a room for just Prime taste test videos
JJ vs Vik vs Minter setup?👇👇
Banger
Miniminter..Legend
Can you react to calux   video spending 24-hours in the sidemen house
My old girlfriend ksi 💀 my brother movin mad
Simon always has the best setups and he deserves it because he posts the most
I can't unsee Josh's face in Mushu's
That's a sick ass setup, jeez.
Why my notifications didn't work what's up with youtube
Big up Ashville!!
this man has achieved so much
new office AGAIN?!?!?!?!
Man I am so happy for you!
Plz do watch alongs of leeds
you should put your CPU in left side it will look much cleaner
nah si you too rich
mushu ???
"I Know, im 30" golden 😂
Is this video giving anyone else motion sickness?
MMMMmmmm!!!
w
It's good and all...but nothing will surpass the sidemen house setups
Love the office it’s absolutely amazing and tala did a fantastic job designing it
rom
I just waiting for the leeds watch along. That would be so sike
The fact that half that room has something to do with KSI is so wholesome
Better than KSI Set Up 😂
All this off of making silly videos and uploading them to the internet. Mad😮‍💨
This setup is SICKKKKK
Damn Simon ,looking gud × Damn, Simon looking gud ✓
looking clean
Aw Simon soz. Dogs are BASIC  and gravitate towards dominance. You are the pants presser in the relationship. Press those pants well.
would be cool to see him play more story based games on console with the sofa set up
Did ashville do it in the end ?
8:11 that fridge is in its prime
Holy W video sheesh
Best set up amongst the Sidemen, for sure
CHEESE
Not Simon having a casting couch 😂
Where is the Nike bearbrick, if you don't need it i would be interested in it
wow
Looks very cool!
Knowing where he came from, to where he is today inspires you to work even harder. Living life to the fullest and spreading love is the way Simon made it in life, inspiring others to do the same.   All the love from India❤️❤️
You have Josh as a pet 😂
I never miss your vids
wait a minute!! WHO BUYS SHOES NOT THEIR SIZE?!?!
Breadman
AAAAA so gassed for simon! he's very proud of it and it looks good!
The new set up bangs 🔥 Kon is a Goat!
I bet he won't do any watchalongs, seems forced
So much better than ksi setup
That setup is fire
Very good video tbf
Mags and Diors is worth as much if not more than the setup. MADDDDD hahaha
W setup this is. R.I.P porno bed set up tho
Can the ksi vinyl fit where the 10 mill plaque  is then put the 2 10 mill plaque go side by side
Wow 🔥
this setup is literally godly, I’m always finding new ways to change up my setup everyday. my next big upgrade is definitely my terrible PC
7:04 Josh got done dirty
ksimon arc
My guy has an office and mancave all in one room
"I'm doing a Harry..  thanks for the money" 😂😂 legend
put the Air Mags in the middle it"ll look more nice
Is there a video of Talia where she designed the studio?
Anyone know the name of the background song at the very beginning??
I think you should do some Leeds games watchalongs on twitch using your sofa, I would watch and I think many others will, also maybe another channel to come with it 👀
I would argue its the best setup in the sidemen
You’re welcome Simon 😎 for my money
The open sensor… Rich problems
Who else thought it was a game he was talking about
what a weird Talia Tuesday   nah but for real, congrats man this is a sick setup and I wish you all the best
where can i get those shoe shelves?
Sidemen house was better.
such a sick setup!
Looking nice this one
7:20 Mushu following it's master
Epic, but you need better light on your mush for the TV streaming set up.  Plus the reflection on your YT plaque is distracting with the light above the TV.. angle of incidence and all that, ask Kon.  Maybe get a swing out light panel on the wall from your left when on the sofa ✌️
You could put one of the mags where you put the boxing glove have one on each side
no friends 😔
5:33 ksi hot pics😂 the pc screen
Summer time side eats should have slushies called sidemen slurpies just named after them then Simon can try all the sidemen for a video
👍🏿
r/tvtoohigh
i love how they edited josh's face onto mushu
Damn this looks sick😳
With that setup I would barely come out the house 👏🏾
the sidemen should do a video on moresidemen plaing fifa on the couch in your office
Dope ass set up !!!❤
Bro the amount of bots these days......please 😭😭😭😭😭
Yuurrrrrr goated
2:06 nah man JJ, Josh and Ethan their relationship is on a whole new level after the golden shower!
Really enjoyed this vid❤️.
get rory jennings on some watch alongs, i think you'd make a great duo
FINALLY!!!!!!!!! you got me waiting 5 years
Extremely jealous of this setup rate it a lot Simon
looks nice
that lights in ceilings are epic.
Easily best set up
The best setup i have seen ❤
Really enjoyed the edit
Did mo edit this video? Lmfao with all the ksimon Easter eggs 🤣🤣
When Talia lied on the couch she looked soo smol 😭
Copy paste comments are crazy
MATEEE Talia smashed it with the interior 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
might have to sub! just coz i thought i was the only person with a chow chow in uk 😂
sui
where did he live?
Wtf is that thumbnail Simon???
This is a new age man cave for sure. Best believe when a domestic occurs Simon comes in here lol 👌
As an inferior designer student,,,Simon,,,if you are reading this,,,,try recliner sofa infront of TV,,,it'll be more good to relax there ,,,and put prime fridge near your desk for easy excess.
A replica world cup trophy would sit perfectly in that wall slot. Or the Leeds United Vodka bottle that josh gifted you.
W
You’re welcome 💵👍🏽
Now we just need the football garden 👀
Josh's face was edited on mushu lmao
Its just sooo soo good to see him get to this point from where he started. Many of us have been following him since a decade now and it surely does make us "Aww" by seeing him do great things in life everyday.
Those transitions are fucking disgusting. NAHHHH
🐐
MO definitely  edited this
damn this setup is looking fresh
Yoooooooooooooo
Editor needs a raise fr
The setup is actually so clean I love it
3:49 liked the tv
ksi have been in your mouth for 15 years
Where did the globe go?
its a good day for reddit fans...  ksimon memes is gonna be wild
lol I was literally just watching videos about people's SetUps.
Those transitions! 🔥🔥🔥
Well thats better than my setup
About time
w
Great video mate, crazy how far you’ve come
BRO the transitions in the reveal edit 🤯
7:03 that's a violation
As happy as I am for all the sideman getting there houses and brand new setups the thing that confuses me is why waist the money each of them were living in good flats why waist the money on building a house when they could just live comfortably in the flats they where living in? But still really happy for them all.
what is the night top talia is wearing?
Need to get my bread up
I love how he can never disappoint us with his content
Sidemen best to worst setups Simon JJ Vik Harry Ethan Tobi Josh
what did u use for the lights on the shelves? looks clean without any wires
Awesome job Simon
u should put the ksi shoes
Mr minter please put the air mags on the middle shoe shelf it’s too expensive to not be the focal point of the wall
Finally a worthy opponent to vikkstar's setup
the only thing i'm not liking here is the distance between the sofa and the TV. It's just too small, not enough room between them.
Miniminter allow me a strawberry watermelon i beg
It’s the real nimrod
Over 7 years…. Still a slender man lookalike
😳
Those creps are dirty tho 😅 imagine having diors and chicagos on your wall just for decoration.
Cleanest transitions of 2023
Simone 🎉
Ye
I can't unsee Josh in the dog face anymore  💀
12:10 those transitions too clean
Neat Livin'the Dream mate

This office is amazing but nothing beats the Sidemen house ❤️

What if Simon did a one question go for Talia Tuesday
Big upsss
Best sdmn gaming setup
long awaited & didn't disappoint, sick setup!!
Simon gotta be the greatest sidemen and moresideman host.
Wuts with British people pronouncing room as "rum"
Last time I was this early, JJ still had hamsters
Happy for him but I also prefer the 2022 one
Imagine saying great video without even watching the whole one
sheesh my man got a full out gaming setup
Simon be living our dreams
To Whoever finds this comment, I wish you the Best life"💫
Looks Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!
