can anyone tell me what the music starting 2:51 is called?
Dear Emm,  I have a question, Which program or application you use for editing your videos? Please explain to me how you making these great videos?
UTTERLY ENJOYABLE AS ALWAYS
The only person who makes Amsterdam look super boring… I don’t know how she done it 😂
The dog is the best part 🐶
0:31 Emma, I wish I can watch this video and hear you talking about this before I visited Amsterdam at the beginning of this month. So that I wouldn’t mistakenly have a cupcake and sandwich that have weed inside and have the most awful hours of my life on that day! (My heart was beating wildly, I was hearing voices and finally I threw up)
🎥🎥🎥dad = cinematographer🎥🎥🎥
I’ve always wanted to go there
Incredible! ❤
Soent a week there all i ate was Mcdonald at coffeeshop they have dopecakes not tasty
please come to Japan
Emma needs to start her own travel vlog !! ❤
love
Fascinating - especially the tampon stuff (really).
did your stuff ever make it back
i cant even explain the peace this videls bring me
The editing of this video is supreme
cool
The editing of the jazz horns to looking at jeans on a rack, in perfect synchronicity, was lovely.
Haha Emma! Just seeing this now and new to your channel. I’m from amsterdam and wished I could have given you a tour. Love your videos. I feel your pain when it comes to tampons. I will never understand why people would buy without applicator other then better for the environment.
This is amazing
❤
im going to amsterdam this weekend and this was my pre-trip hype video
Music excelente.
Tulips, windmills… oh, what a wonderful experience Amsterdam has to offer! Loved my Amsterdam trip.❤
Türkçe altyazi olsa keşke
Song?
Best Emma hair style and color Emma ever had.
Soooo cute you are
USING HAARLEM FOR THE INTRO WAS ILLEGAL!!!
Seeing the older gentleman paint on the street, brought tears to my eyes.. sights like this are the reason for living, humanity is beautiful.
emma , looking forward a new vlog, plz!!!!!
2 years late but 10:25 I completely agree and love the pants that are super comfy but look put together and professional I call them dress sweats lmao
i miss the old emma
1:25 crazy
Wyd
She is doing the 'I am such a wackiest American girl' show. But there appears to be a market for this sort of ci content.
9:53. Were those two Ghanaians speaking Twi?
does anyone knows where the socks store located :D
Discovering emma was not the solution to my procrastination I needed right now.  I wish I could live like this 😭
Weed coffeeshops are in the whole of the Netherlands, not only in Amsterdam
emmas legit my only friend and im fine with it

Does anyone know the song at 3:20
Does anyone know where the photobooth is located?

AZ told me Engaging in positive and health-oriented challenges can foster motivation and a sense of community while promoting well-being
I have felt really lonely recently and I have been thinking about dating; using tinder or some speed dating shit. Today I stumbled upon your video and it reminded me that if I somehow pushed myself into something simply because I am a bit desparate, I could potentially end up with somebody like you and that would very quickly lead to series of decisions which would effect in life imprisonment.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍🇺🇸.
The most cliche thing to do when you go to the Netherlands: Go to Amsterdam
love you
this country is so depressing
emma do you prefer copenhagen or amsterdam
For more information text 'tamp on' to 2552
The first 0.23 sec is the city of Haarlem and not Amsterdam 😉
Honey the first few shots are Haarlem?
Many men prefers short women than tall women because they found that tall women are too masculine
NEVER EVER CUT YOUR CHEESE LIKE THAT AGAIN BIG CRIME
This is the best "an American in Amsterdam" video I've seen. Glad you enjoyed it. Come back anytime.
Don’t be fooled, the first 30 seconds are shots of Haarlem. Not Amsterdam.
You’re vibe is so good😍😁
that the worst vlog i've ever seen, you make me lost 20 minutes
Literally there rn
NEDERLAAANNNDDDD🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱
hii

Wrinkling Ireland
Tomothee
She's German
First 25 seconds was in Haarlem, my hometown. please dont compare us with Amsterdam ty :p
As a european I would not trust the tampons with applicator. What if it shoves the tampon too deep in and hurts me, like no. Never. I need the control over the tampon with my finger.
bruv she’s so fun
Those bnw photo booth pictures were gold.
take me to amserdam pls
Me: Ah cool she will send her stuff back to USA! Also me when I saw PostNL: NNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
I absolutly LOVE Emma and casualy look back at every videos she ever made, that's how big of a fan of her i am. BUT the cheese cut part at 12:48 BURNT my european (french) eyes. I can't unseee it. My mouth stayed wild open for a solid 2 minutes thinking she was playing around. I cannot comprehend what just happened. I had to comment to be sure im not the only one. Is there other people that cut there cheese like that ? I need to know. Only love for Emma <3 but please.... dont... cut..the...cheese...like...its...a...cake?
🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱
Luv Wath your videos❤
I’ve been to Amsterdam twice it’s my favorite place to travel at this point!
Does anyone know what camera is she using for vlogging? Thank you!!
As If I'm there... 💚
I've just realized how boring her vlogs are!
So buzzy! I moved from New Zealand to Amsterdam and the post shop you went to to ship your stuff home is on my road 😆
never in my life have I seen someone cut cheese like that.
Emma, you are truly a traveler by definition. I mean, the dynamics of the video content are super unexpected, but for the best reasons, and I love it so much, haha
So I just found "emma in the world" on spotify and watched it again there and I do not know if I have already said this but a tip to make stale things not stale anymore: put a piece of bread in the bag or box of the stale food and the moisture in the bread will basicly go in to the food and the bread will dry out, is the food stil stale than the piece was to small, works great for cookies.
Thank you. You have very cool glasses. Where can i find them?
Hello i am from Bangladesh
09:38 hr the chocolate bunny is called Nijntje, which is short for konijn. You know Coney Island? It used to be a Dutch name namely Konijneneiland. Rabbit Island. Nijntje is very famous in the Netherlands. Nice video 🎉
Find it truly wild that people want applicators for tampons. All that extra waste! But Emma is a queen.
ok only in the beginning here and watched a few of your videos and your like always on your period hahahah but im wondering did you never try menstrual cups? like I think tampons and pads are super uncomfortable, and for sure its not the first time you've heard of it lol so do you just not like them or? because that's all I use, I think its the most comfortable period method on the planet lol anyways if you haven't tried once you get past the learning curve which there's a big one then its revolutionary hahaha
Eh, I don't think that was a bee in your soup, it was a wasp, and a pretty big one at that as well...  Bees are generally friendly and you need to piss them off really bad before they attack (since it costs them their life when they sting), but wasps don't care (not only because they are typically more aggressive in general but also because they survive a sting and can sting more than once.
luv dis vid ima def try to go to amsterdam dis year
Nice video! If ever visit again, as a local I can show on a motor new sightseeing experience in city areas. 🏍️ Greetings from Amsterdam everyone🇳🇱.
piece of art
8:37 is that kid Rolling the suitcase upside down? So instead of rolling it’s just dragging? 🥲🫶🏼

oh mijn God, ik ben al zo lang niet meer in Amsterdam geweest. Het is zo'n prachtige plek om rond te hangen, maar elke keer als ik probeer te gaan, is er zoveel verkeer. Misschien ga ik later wel naar Maastricht
"guess who gets to go shopping?! mme." you're so cute, emma.
what is the name from the shoes they are so pretty
I just love the fact she got so confused by a 'loose' tampon, I'm dutch and well, it's indeed not the most fun thing to do haha
Her shoes. Is it samba or superstar?
Don't come to Amsterdam. We don't want any more tourists
The credits were everything. I appreciate NO ADVERTISEMENTS OR CLICK BAIT.
Amsterdam is perhaps one of the most unique cities in the world. But for the people it has long been a big change because of the immigrants and that is why you will only find real Amsterdammers and Dutch people in certain neighbourhoods of the city. I myself, who was born in this city, find it disgusting to see only 50 percent of the people in most cities who come from another country and have only immigrated fairly briefly and this is all thanks to our government and the E.U. Not only the Netherlands has been attacked by these people, gradually in Sweden this is also becoming more and more clear how the freedom of the real people is at the expense of migrants from Islamic countries.
I'm planning an itinerary to Europe and I feel so inspired to visit Amsterdam, Netherlands after this. I want to know the name of the boutiques that she visited !!
pure beauty
where are the sunglasses from?
Feel you totally on the 'loose tampon' thing hahhaha
EMMA YOU SHOULLLLD COME TO TURKEY W YPUR DADDD
OMG it’s so cute!!!! When she said” wow this little bread is so beautiful and you can’t take a bite out of it before the coffee comes! Actually probably someone can’t relate to that but that’s actually how i act in everyday day life just like some kind of OCD nuts.
She even continued the soup after found out the mosquitoes in the bowl
Watching this made me happy!!!!!!!
8:46 me in 2073
super...
emma ur so precious u should know that
The video is so soothing love it
can you shoot a movie with timothee chalamet？
Why doesn’t she just ship home her shopping goods? Then she didn’t have to limit herself to just the essentials
This is the worst Amsterdam video I ever watched. You shouldn’t do any videos.

Flying there in less than a month on my 18 bd 23.10😤
she look like timothy chalamte
I can't believe you didn't get those red shorts. I would've died
why do you make this videos like if you were alone? the cameraman never speaks?
Excuse me if i,m wrong but i think i just saw socks.
I didn't know women could be this funny 😂
I got shivers in the first few seconds of this 😂
her nails are short, her carry on is empty.  This is casual Emma.
No, because what the guck is an applicator? No idea how to use them, it's puzzling to me
Me not knowing how to use a tampon with an applicator because I’m German and we don’t have those here 💀
listen and read, koffie and coffee, this is the difference , a place where there is the Dutch word then it is the beverage, Coffee Shop is the emotional appeal of the international people, there is coffee often in the weed shop, the strange thing in the US is the word Dispensary
these kind of videos are so relaxing <3
No! Niep!
A Model Diet and good Haircut
This video is a work of art, I love it so much
You went to one of the best cities Haarlem!
Pertemanan
There's a surprising amount of longing shots of this girls behind considering who is filming 😊
I live in Amsterdam, first time i visited the US this was my face exactly when i saw the US tampons for the first time
That dog on 2:02 was mad moon walking
I like to travel with you Emma 😂
As a Dutch person, I absolutely detest Amsterdam, but at least vicariously through Emma’s vibes i can at least enjoy it a bit
Hi, i am so glad i found you, i like you so much Emma!  💚
donate the clothes you felt like you wore too much haha
I love the way that you explore the city cnter so amazing
How can she be so energetic while on her period, couldn’t be me
yammmmmmme umuu
No alcohol molecules in anything
Drink more freshwater
11:52 is literally the cutest thing ever… I can’t tell if those two are a couple, but I love it.
Please, go to Sankt Peterburg❣
What the fuck why do americans have applicators for their tampons to even make more waste ? so unneccesary you have your finger
the guy selling his painting was so adorbale
That dancing haul made my day. 😂
loose tampons reduce plastic waste! and like really, do we even need the applicator?
the old man painting is so cute!!! 🥺
This is seriously so therapeutic :))
does anyone know which photobooth is that in amsterdam?
Im 7'6  I will go nether When i become 7'10
On the tampon topic: Americans are so funny 😂
2:48 lol "what's a loose tampon 🤨"
Timothee Chalamet girl version😊
Does anyone know where Emma’s knitted blue sweater is from I’m in love with it and I can’t seem to find it anywhere! x
I just wanna know if Emma got high. I wish for her. Amsterdam is the best place for this occasion
Please someone tell me which rayban sunglasees is she wearing 😫😫 the yellow-orangey ones
Hi, people! I’m new in Amsterdam. Tell me one thing: How i can to meet convenient with people here? I’m man, 28 years old, open mind, athletic body, interesting at art. But problem when i go alone in the city I always see a lot of groups of people men with girls. I see they not interested on it. Yes i know, bars, festivals, sure. But there the same situation!!! And i need to drink. I don’t want to drink any time;)))) About Bumble I know too, but I want to meet with people live, don’t wait a some matching and spend time for chatting about weather;)) Other situation people just go or ride fast for their deals. Did you feel same situation, how did you decide?
Hello, as a young Moroccan 🇲🇦 student of history books, I believe that what the Netherlands has achieved in terms of progress is, thanks to God, thanks to the good Dutch people and the kind royal family, especially the mother Patricks, who relinquished power to her son ten years ago, so that the Netherlands could become the most prestigious country. Thank you.
I have a speech impediment, and joke around saying I was from Netherland. What I did not know is I do indeed sound like I from the Netherlands.
5:36 me with life :  "i was determined to make this work" "its not working for me"
Sending your favourite clothes home?🤷‍♂️😅
Enjoyed this video. Like your style and pace.  I am going to Amsterdam in a week.  Thanks for the tips
Your dad has a great photographic eye 😉
loose tampons are more environmentally friendly anyways! no plastic applicators!
I think emma and Timmy Cha would make a good match
this video cured my stomach ache
Love the video!
i pissed my pants in an amsterdam metro yolo
The haul dancing had me.
I swear to god those shoes must be the most comfy shoes in the world she literally wears them in every single video throughout every country
love, i love holland, the girls there are nice,taller beautiful, and most friendly people on eart,  forgive is best  love is better than hate
It looks like she went to every city of killing eve series
These are my favourite videos ever
Emma has the style of a single middle woman with a million cats hahaha.
so ur just not gonna let us know if we can pack scissors in our carry on or not
8:47 I love this part with the artist so much. I’ve watched it multiple times it’s just really beautiful 🥹
I drink coffee twice daily but every time i come across her on social media it makes me wanna chug a pitcher of iced cappucino
the polaroid. wtf thats amazing
watching friends isn't enough i need to sit in central perk every day
love the Miffy chocolate!
I love these Emma Vlogs so much
I always wonder how ppl don’t recognize her in public . I’d scream the sh*t out of me hahaha she’s adorable.
nice
OMG emma in AH!!!
Does she... does she eat and shop? Cant you do that literally everywhere else as well?
Is there anyone who knows the brand of the bag in black?
Anyone tell me name of the song at the beginning?
Great editing job once again. Credits to the cameraman, good bumper shots of Amsterdam. Emma nails it.
Is that a fucking pigeon
So, you're in one of the great cities of the world ... did you see any of it?  (Other than a few clothes stores?) Get moved, struck, inspired?  Engage with anyone?  A life centered around coffee, clothes and selfies is ... kinda tragic.
Im a 11th grade studying for a collage in netherlands and id say its been a hard path to choose especially while all my friends are having fun outside and living their lives (they are going to study for collage next year) and whenever I start feeling stressed or unmotivated I open this video. With Emma's energy and the cinematography of this video my mood instantly increases. :)
never thought i'd see emma chamberlain carrying an Albert Heijn bag lol

To be honest, that was a really interesting video! Thumbs up, and keep going sis!
What brand and style of shades is she wearing? Help me guys. It looks so good.
I remember that cat shirt
the way you cut that cheese hurt my dutch soul
What Adidas shoes is she wearing?
the pigeon socks were meant to be
i bought the same socks in the same shop and the lady was so sweet (: 14:54
about the scissors... i need to rant because i am still so bitter about this. i've taken the plane twice in my life, and the first time i took the plane, i brought my pencil case with my beloved pair of scissors (no but really it was a good pair) and they threw it away at the airport because i assumed it was considered a dangerous item. i miss my pair of scissors and it's been more than four years.... i hope wherever you are, dear pair of scissors, you still think about me
she just like me fr with the soup after the bee thing
8:57 that man makes me want to buy all of his art piece and hang it in my room, look how he smiles 🥹🥹
the man selling paintings tho he’s got a warm vibes
beautiful cinematography
WHO left my granola open????
Emma is the only person that started as a influencer and is now a celeb.
I wish the Dutch people all the best in the world and their next years without any virus in their country
the man with the paintings made me emotional so cute omg
amazing
Pero que videasooo
Love that her dad gets to travel with her all the time, and create memories together. it's perfect. <3 <3
socks with pigeons pretty cool =D
Thx Tycho, from Amsterdam, for sending us here 💯 Come on Emma You knew about cafes n Coffeeshops lol xD Wakey bakey 😵‍💫 jk But seriously I'd come back just for the standard cuppa coffee, almost like turkish style

2:51 WHAT IS THAT MELODY?
this is art.
Tampons without applicators are actually much better for the environment than the ones you have in the US, the US applicators with their wrapping etc. create sooo much more plastic and waste :) I found it weird how in the US you would only use them with an applicator, like they're scared of touching their own body
Emma chamberlain relates on being Leslie serna she got tattoos to be self kept in an thought out. Circumspect of being liked in keeping a character monologue self.
I'm so delighted watching 1st world problems...
I'm from Brazil and here the tampons doesn't have applicators too, and when I tried the US version it was like "That's so weird and uncomfortable" hahaha
Why not buy another suitcase/bag for all the new items LOL. You'd just have two bags instead of one.
I’ve anybody of you ever goes to Amsterdam and need any help? Or has any questions?? Let me know! Here to help
You eat “Nijntje” chocolate! Didn’t you recognize it Emma?
the old man painting made me cry
Lmao the way she cuts a bite of the cheese with a *knife* and slaps it on her bread
2:04 dog moonwalk
Haha you went for a French pain au chcolate while you could have eaten Dutch pancakes girl, you missed out!
I want that Beatles Sgt Peppers shirt.
the intro isn't amsterdam.....
The editing to put searching through the jeans to line up perfectly with the music>>>
emma move to europe
emma being amazed at a 32 tampon box meanwhile i buy a 64 tampon box. also it's weird to see the other side of this, i was absolutely confused by the applicators the first time i tried it, still prefer the ones without
Noooooooo please don’t keep eating that soup 😭😭😭😭😭
this is my comfort video
I love knowing that Emma met my favorite Dutch youtuber (Jesse Hoefnagels) here who i feel can totally vibe with her. They both make short videos, but they're real and unique and always lighten my mood.
I subscribed when I saw the pigeon socks
Omg the sock shop is from my auntie. Proud!!
Bytheway, she was not joking about the coffeeshops selling weed, but I'm fairly certain they wouldn't sell you a croissant or brownie without telling you what's in it. Also, the smoking people around you (allowed only in coffeeshops) and the strong smell of weed will give you a hint once you enter the shop. (Just saying because I've been told by folk that they wouldn't visit Amsterdam because they would be "Taken" like in "Taken" and sold in auction.
Well we all know why she’s there hahaha 💨
I can smell the thrift stores through the screen
Easy Button: As a frequent business flyer, I carry a compact fully-collapsed cargo bag folded up in the side pocket of my carry-on; when I return with stuff I bought, I just move my dirty laundry over to the cargo bag and check it at the airport for free on my return flight. Stuff I bought goes into my carry-on. If you’re business class, or you have almost any air miles membership with your airline, you get a free international checked bag (or two, or three).  I get three free checked bags on American as an Executive Platinum member.
Hi... My name is Vadim! I'm Ukrainian who makes videos about Netherlands. I will be very happy to see you in my channel...
the couple at 11:53 is so fashonble its crazy... intimidated to got there next summer..
0:00 - 0:18 Haarlem, the capital of North Holland!
Emmas new filming style reminds me of Alexa Chung
So Verry good your kontent, amazing .. hello I'am from indonesia
04:09 the scanner is a cymbal-bell
Wait what?! The first few shots in the intro are definitely Haarlem. 😂😂
Yall need to chill with these gaslighting comments 😂 its just your average vlog with bare minimum shots
Omg where can i find the shops with al of the lovely socks???
17:20 song is Just a Dawn Away by Robin Henson :)
emma in de albert heijn zien is echt werid af maar guess what? #gekoloniseerd
i love how everyone rides a bike
I love your dad’s cinematography
love the socks
yeeeah, we usually dont have applicators or whatever in europe, just tampons
This intro was so good, and cute! Love ya girly💗
Go off Emma with your bullshit videos, I was looking for Neville Chamberlain videos
that girl with bangs walking up to that guy was straight out of a movie
how is it possible for her to walk in stores this casually without getting recognized i don't get it😭💌
emma make the switch from tampons to thinx. not sponsored but it's life changing.
“Is that a fucking pigeon” REMINDERS OF HIM !! Omggggg I love her
0:44 ahhhhh... thats why i feel so nuts everytime iam in amsterdam...
Its usual in europe that there is so applicader with it
I am desperate to know what style of Levi’s she is wearing!!
Emma for your next trip you should try period underwear! its a life saviour for busy gals
i wonder if she likes to get gaped on the regular. Imma bet she is a fan.
feels like watching a movie
Where are her sunglasses from?!? The black with orange shades???
I stopped at 1.30 when she put that pain au chocolat on the table. I mean c'mon, first you suffer through the ad infestation /two ads/, then you get to watch her filming herself... Please, I'm not here to watch YOU
Love to see Emma so peaceful in my homecountry :)
I didn't discover Emma's videos until Covid, and I just love her so much and that fact that she is so comfortable being herself. It feels like I'm hanging out with an old friend whenever I watch her videos
The Dutch English accent is everything😭
Wish you loved us fans and post at least once a month
your father's videography is fantastic. He is really good, hang out with him more :D
can anyone tell me the music at 3:16?
8:19 she’s just so happy
i love this
wooow
Tampons: im a girl from the Netherlands and i did not know that tampons with applicators were a thing until i saw it in a american youtube video. We just push em in with our finger and wash our hands very well :) no waste of plastic :)
You don’t have to ship your extra clothes, just buy a suitcase and the airline will charge you about 30$ for that…
Emma es literalmente Timothee Charmander
I always loved Emma’s vlogs so muchh and today i came to the realisation that she literally is Michael Scott’s female version!!😅❤
Pick me up...
i want to buy a paint from that old man 🥰🥰🥰 9:00
I LOVE YOU EMMMAAAA, CAN U GO TOT HE PHILIPPINES!!!!! I LOVE TO SHARE MY PLACE TO U AND WE HANG OUT TOGETHER! COME HERE PLEASE. IM UR FAN!
You just have to put the tampon on your vagina haha Your vlogs are cute emma. You always made my day fine!
What is the name of the hotel?  It looks fantastic.
“is that a fucking pigeon?” Emma have you been reading coho
Absolutely no idea what is this about, but Amsterdam is magnificent every time of the year.
12:14 when the music matched emma going through the jeans, ugh amazing
emma... y do u look like michael scott so much? like its itching my brain
12:12 notice how the beats match perfectly with her looking through the jeans, i like to think that it was actually planned because it is so satisfying 😭
I thoroughly enjoyed this
The whole intro video is in Haarlem i guess
Her problem with the tampon is kind of funny, because when I was in the US my biggest fear was that I have to use on of those tampons, like I'm not putting plastic in there!
It is just so relaxing to watch your travel videos!! I honestly can't describe the feeling and the reason why I simply love this channel xx
Those photo booth pics are so “teenage dirt back baby” vibes
17/12/22
you're dad is such an artist like i could literally just watch an hour worth of the clips he captures with no narration whatsoever and love it
Pls let’s b friends. i give cheese
Huge L not grabbing the blueberry socks as well Emma
Emma, you are so articulate and the way you express your thoughts is so fluid…your very bright 🤙
are a transgender?
omg i was wondering who she was traveling with and i realize from the comments that it’s her dad !!!
❤Beautiful place. Thanks for sharing it with us, and also sharing your point of view. ❤
Rotterdam >
emma's videos are already so comforting and familiar before knowing these moments were captured by her dad 😭
these videos capture the simple beautiful moments of human life. Looking through your dads perspective we can see his love for finding beauty in people and places
Chocolate is delicious in the Netherlands bc of the milk, same with cheese. The cows are living in freedom. Basically a lot of stuff tastes better in the Netherlands... xD
This is the best video ever….
What’s a lose tampon? 😭😂i love this girl 🫶🏾
Video title: Amsterdam *Opens with a bunch of shots of Haarlem*
This was so special. A piece of cinematography yet never stiff, always familial. I wish I could do more than like it.
wow! she edited this. she aint got no editor anymore
If I was rich I'd eat fresh fruit all day long.
John 3:16, God bless ❤
Australians have loose tampons too, sorry you had to find out this way x
Americans are so cringe, we hate them
HI
that video... was so peaceful... i almost fell asleep. it was really nice
this video felt like a wes anderson movie<3
i know shes talked about this before but i forgot how she survives without the tampon for like a million hours
EMMA. SWITCH TO THE CUP.
Does anyone have an ID for these glasses 0:48
I fucking loved the haul! It was.. Perfect.
this made me miss amsterdam so much it's so damn beautiful
I'm a mom of four little kids and I don't know why, but I love Emma!
Go to Brazil next
Go to Mexico next
I miss Amsterdam I lived there for two years and I miss it dearly
My tampon came loose from that part from laughing 😂😂😂😂
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO WORE THE SAME TWO SLEEP SHIRTS TO BED OVER AND OVER LOL THERE JUST THE MOST COMFIEST AND WHEN IT COMES TO BEDTIME I HAVE TO BE IN A COMFY SHIRT!!
THIS VIDEO IS AMAZING. AHHHHHHHHH emma and her father are so talented!!
12:13 when she was going through the jeans and moved them to the music
I really like how she talk to the camera or poses then just walks away😂😂
OMG Get outta town! I love your Haul dance!  I'm  a 40 year old first time single mom...up at 4 am watching Emma videos on the big screen  with my 4 month old. Drinking black coffee, just trying to stay busy until 10 am when I'm  allowed to add almond milk to my drink. (I'm intermittent fasting). You are hilarious and make my mornings much more fun.
hearing her complain about not having space to buy new clothes.... like girl stfu
i just realized we were in amsterdam at the same fucking time
I’m going to Amsterdam for spring break and this video just makes me even that more excited to go. Ugh emma you’re such a joy
The dance made me feel at home :)
imagine going to another country thinking you'll get coffee but they offer you to another dimention, i wouldn't complain. but coffee comes first
Guys did you know if you watch cod mw2 2022 and watch the whole video you will see a mission like the video from Amsterdam
I’ve been using tampons with no applicator for years as a US person bc it was always what my mom used. Went to college and offered one to a girl who asked if anyone had a tampon… she was just as confused. I never knew they weren’t a thing????? Anyway, she pretended everything was normal and googled “tampons with no applicators” while she was in the bathroom and told me they were popular in Europe 🥲
What is it with Emma’s vlogs. I just watched someone buy coffee & pastries and shop, normal stuff but I loved every minute of it! How do they make the mundane look so fab? Perhaps it’s Emma quirky sense of humour & the incredible backdrop of Amsterdam. Which incidentally is my most fav places in the world. Yep that could’ve be it.
She's so funny 😂😭
Amazing content. Your dad is so good at shooting videos. The images were calming and accurate and your energy is always so good to watch honestly. A day in Emma's life, in Amsterdam. Simply beautiful. That's all
12:12 thank you so much for this
You’re a genius
My brother in-law is from The Netherlands. I do like Amsterdam, but if you really wanna be visiting a great city in The Netherlands it's Den Haag
Watched the dog breakdancing 5 times. It's a great day 😊
I truly do not understand how you got famous
emma is pure humor i luv it
"ive had a lot of wine, you know what I mean?" -  Emma chamberlain' 22
Does anyone know where that foto booth is? I love in the Netherlands 😜
Another shocking American thing when you go to Amsterdam: sex stuff EVERYWHERE 😂 I’m not kidding, you’ll go into a pharmacy and look to your left and BOOM sex toys and ducks everywhere
i bought socks on that same store 😭😭 love it
come to the philippines
Ocean eyes
Always wanna watch more 🥹 superb content
Emma in an Albert Hein is messing with my head
2:50 I'm losing my shit. I've lived in America and in the Netherlands and I don't know why but it never actually accused to me that the in the Netherlands you don't have an applicator until now. Emma's reaction in priceless though.
Chocolate croissants make my world go round honestly
I really wish I could move to Amsterdam. Such a cool place
ok so from where do i know the bunny on the chocolate? Can smn help???
I love the haul 🤠
LOVED the dancing haul
Nice place to travel someday 🙏😘
very boring. two stars max review. sorry
I love that in europe we use 'loose' tampons bc I think that the applicator and the package of every single tampon is such a waste of material and plastic, it might feel gross to just stick ur finger in but u wash ur hands afterwards anyway right:)
When she bout the scissors and didn’t know why she bought them 😂😂😂
beautiful video i love emma lol
THE TAMPON THING HAPPENED TO ME JN AMSTERDAM TOO IT WAS SO WEIRD 😭😂
The soup slurp after the bee though #epic
the random dog barking in the background was perfect  and random lol
Yo Waz up foo it was so cool meeting you on 7th Avenue outside the weed shop called Rush Hour you listened to my rap power I'm really hopin you'd be down to chill let's pick out a time when I can show you a thrill and if we're meant to be you'll be in my will about a year ago I lost my Grandpa Bill he was always a legend incredible
Why has emmas content changed so drastically??
Hellloow, new sub here. Hot Ones sent me. I'm from Amsterdam and just found your channel. No regrets subbing; I'll be bingeing the F out of this nook of the Youtubes. <3
17:20 what's the song plz ?
Life through the lens of a father 💗
We have the same last name let's gooooo! Glad to see it great vids great work

These new aesthetic of her videos are just so calming and relaxing and just beautiful as it is. I feel so motivated and relaxed after these.

I love how they Film like regular people doing things it’s so nice!
My dream place 🤩
hey there am new to Amsty! whats the socks shop? at least the street
does anyone know where her bag is from or what it’s called? i love it so much
The first second before the coffeeshop story is not Amsterdam 😢 It’s Haarlem!
Emma in the Netherlands makes so much sense
Does anyone know where her glasses may be from in the beginning of the vlog?
these travel vlogs are everything. i love coming back to them and feeling so peaceful and happy when I watch. definitely a form of therapy
mmm yes, teylers museum in Amsterdam....
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee !!!!!!! 😍 weeeeeeed
does anybody know the socks shop?
ME ENCANTA EL QUESO
m encantas
DOES ANYONE KNOW THE LEVI'S MODEL THAT EMMA WEARS?
Loved the way the video was filmed, really just art. and just to let you know there are tampons with applicator at the alberthein from the same brand that u bought, I used that for years when I started using tampons. but now I just use the "lose" tampons.
Are you kidding… You can wash your clothes in the hotel. Right now you are promoting waste of resources to a very young audience. I know it may be not fair, but letˋs be real. You are a millionaire, who is traveling around the world. You could promote worse things. But… did you know that almost every American has a clothing storage, even the ones who earn only as much as 25.000 a year? I really like your authentic content, but this one made it very American and unaware in a way if you know what I mean (maybe the two fit together and Ím a bit too salty)..
I can’t believe you were so close. It’s so funny to see you experience my country haha.
good dance
Came to see video about Amsterdam …..1st 5 minutes talking about Tampons bye ………..
IS THAT A FUCKING PIGEON
thanks
I’ve never felt so calm watching a yt video before living for these vlogs
why am I just now discovering this amazing woman hahaha
11:53 was such a cute interaction that was caught. i love people watching and that clip made me happy
this dad video series simply has to go on, I need these every single day
Like what you've done here Emma.. ❤️
The chocolate and cheese is literally built different 😂
me looking for the comment that talks about “is that a f*cking pigeon?” and it’s connection to Reminders of Him by Colleen Hoover 😂
lmaooo the tampons are so funny i have never used an applicator in my life
“That is guuuuudda” LMAO
LMAO LOVE YOU EMMA
$400 alone in sunglasses *cries in poor*
you are so extra and i love it
more proof of Emma being a cool chick Michael Scott
EMMA
I almost choked laughing on my food at 2:50
I love Amsterdam and love this girl
💗💗
I feel like you should come back to Amsterdam in Summer, do some festival(s) here, drink beers on different terraces (east, west and south). Rent a small boat and go to Oude kerk aan de Amstel. Visit the adam tower and get the best view of Amsterdam. And most importantly, visit in a weekend when there is also the outside ‘ijhallen’!!! That’s really the best thing for thrifting and find hidden gems 💎 😊 (message from a real insider) ;)) xxxx
God, I love her!❤
speaking of the chocolate thing, im from australia but i tried american chocolate and holy crap it’s the most disgusting thing
the hand prints r the backboard of the bed at 5:29
pls fix all my problems and someone tell me the name of the sock shop
I haven't watched your videos since 2019, and wow I can see you've grown a lot as a person. You used to be this kind of crazed coffee teen, but now you're really all grown up. Maturity and finding yourself has really made you into a fine individual today I'm proud to have seen you grow. Best of luck Emma❤
11:54 did that girl just ask the dude out like theyre in some sort of movie? cause i swear it looked like that 😍
This girl should  notbe allowed to have scissors
As a resident of Netherlands this popped up in my feed.  I do not understand how this has so many views. I also don't really understand vloggers. I can just walk around on my typical day and get millions of views?  But if others enjoy it, what can I say.
USA must be about the only place where most people use tampons with applicators
I love you! Honestly you make me feel so comfortable letting myself be me ❤
you’re gonna have such incredible memories with your dad to look back on 🥹🥲
The beginning is not Amsterdam
omg you were in the netherlands!!!!??????
the way the music lines up with her sorting through the jeans is so satisfying {12:13}
loose tampons are the scariest thing
Amazing how the first shots the filmed are actually Haarlem & not Amsterdam..
wait- applicator for a tampon? Do American insert like whole applicators with tampons? That can't be comfortable
Holy S***!! An entire store of ONLY socks???
An entire store of JUST cheese??? In America, we have like 4 ....
The scissors are to cut off any loose strings on your clothing so you don't have the temptation to pull them which could be disastrous
You cannot ship home too many clothes  because then you don't have the selection..
Silk??? You're gonna get spoiled!
Isn't a loose tampon one that's easy to get to have sex with?
You should have your own channel on tv 😩
Really nice and cute video😊
i wanna live a life like this 💔💔 traveling with my dad n all its the cutest thing i’m going to cry omg
They way she disappears after she is done talking 😭I’m done 😂
Finally a video where its not summer in Amsterdam. I'll move soon there so thank you for the video.
your videos are cinematographic masterpieces
this was amazing, especially extra when you're super high. loved it
sick credits love yall
15:23 vibes hit the fan
That was the absolute best haul I’ve watched in my life - it single-handedly cured all my problems
I love how absolutely chaotic she is wherever she goes. It cracks me up and makes you want to keep watching.
I'm supposed to be at an YouTube event in Las Vegas I've waited a year for. Was in a bad accident on the way. Walked away SAFE. Bummed about missing the event. So greatful we are alive & OK.  100% content to be watching Emma videos and chilling today. Just finished Denmark video. My mom was born there🥰 LOL that's like an OB tampon. Just pop it up there🤣😂👍
me, an australian woman, never knowing tampons had applicators because they just don’t exist in this country
This minute 1:42 made think that she have to come to argentina, the facturas are just going to blow her mind
omg i went to amsterdam last week and bought one of that mans paintings he was so sweet i can’t wait to put it up!!
Lowkey obsessed with her travel videos with her dad. They’re so subtle and sweet.
she makes my unfavourite city in the world look actually fun
2:01 something weird hapening and the dog starts to moonwalk :D
“The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.” ‭‭2 Peter‬ ‭3:9‬ ‭NIV‬  ROMANS 10:9-11 “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame”   Matthew 11:28-30  “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”  “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”” ‭‭Luke‬ ‭19:10‬ ‭  God wants us to believe in His One and Only Son, Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, who died for our sins :D When we truly believe in our hearts that Jesus is the Son of God, who died for our sins so we could have eternal life with God, we are saved from the eternal fire and have eternal life in Christ Jesus!! 💖 May God bless you all! 💞😊
hdp
LITERALLY SO interesting and entertaining. I LOVE that style of videography!!
I loveeee this video and the edit and cinematography. Emma needs a show of shopping her way through Europe
We need a new vlog!!! We miss ya🥹💖
oh my god emma???? the music ?? ARE WE IN A FILM RN ?😫😫😍
Ok I think I'm addicted to this video, I've rewatched this prob more than 10 times. I love Amsterdam soooo much. And I loooove your dad's filmography. And I loooveee your chill vibe. ❤️❤️❤️
Wowww
I dont get why millions of people watch this. This is just someone living their life and talking about it. Wouldnt you rather live your own.
Can somebody help me with the term 'applicator'? I mean i get that it's supposed to help u or sum, but why ..., Why? Why have they never learned how to just idk, do it like we do it?   Just help me out here
Emma lookin cool and chilled out during the visit, wonderful review.
love those raybans
First 20 seconds is Haarlem, not Amsterdam 🥹🥹
Does anyone know where her sunnys are from 😢
11/10 would cover your feet with my baby gravy, two times
The podcast is really relatable!!
the mf bee, my obsession. emma <3
It's been a month without a video
the cinematography is exquisite also I NEED the sgt. peppers shirt
Wow.  A coffesshop sells pot in Amsterdam?  Who would have thought that?  This has been true for at least 40 years.  You have NOTHING new or interesting to say about Amsterdam, or anything.  Suggest you p*ss off back to the US and try to impress people there.  This is just DRIVEL.  Get lost.
I dont understand the hype around her. boring
Just recently discovered you. Your humor and charm is great and super entertaining. I can see how you built your YouTube and coffee business empire. Amazing job, congrats to you !
Hahaha love your first shots BUTTTT That’s my city; that’s NO AMSTERDAM!!!! Haarlem it issss ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Does anyone know the name of the cafe she got the croissant from? 🥐🤎
The way u kendall jennerd that cheese girl ICONIC
I just discovered Emma’s channel (and her existing) a few days ago because her Amsterdam video popped up in my recommendations (maybe because i’m from amsterdam) and she already changed my life. Seriously. This week she inspired me to go workout, pick up a book again, take a prepared lunch to work, even take cucumber and cherry tomatoes to work as a snack?! I ❤ you Emma, you have the loveliest personality and you are beautiful and you motivate me and so mang others to do good things. Thank you!
Amsterdam is tesl
The Reminders of Him reference at 14:31
You've got to love the "haul" part of this video!!!!! I've rewatched just the haul part, for more than 10 times now😭😭😭🤩🤩🤩💯
the music with the flipping of the jeans was just perfect.
I love every single thing about her but I am so mad that I didn’t saw here even though I know every place she went to. Like I wanna scream but I don’t!
she did an haul in the hal (im dutch)
love that the video name is amsterdam and all of the intro shots are in made in haarlem
you truly are one of the most simply entertaining people 🤭
Hi I just don't understand why you and some other youtubers or influencers don't say a word about Iran and the horrible situation in there. Listen, I'm exactly the same age as you, it's true. maybe I wasn't lucky enough to be born somewhere else, I think of dying everyday, I wake up crying. I go to sleep crying. but I think famous people like you have to remind themselves that there is no difference between them with other people like me. And if you're rich and famous today EMMA it's only because of this people! maybe you need to sit and think about it for 5 minutes. cause I myself watched all of your fucking youtube videos for 1000 times, and I have lot of Persian friends that are following you and they love you. So can you at least post something for this people that are getting killed everyday, just cause they want to be free and live a normal life? Can you at least post something about #Mahsaamini about 16 years old #Nikashakrami about Women Life Freedom, about Humanity
This is amazing to watch as someone born in Amsterdam
amazing
Does anybody know where the sock store is? Or what's its name? Pleeease, I'm going there and I wanna know
I really love the clip of the sr painting and selling his paintings
<3333
Эммочка 😍👍
Will you visit Poland ?
I love the sad music when your sending your clothes away lmao
Girl I can't believe you didn't know tampons came like this I love you and our cultural differences 🤣🤣🤣🤣❤ (I'm from Portugal, maybe it's an European thing??? But I do like the ones with applicator better ahaha)
best haul in this channel yet
Huh? Why do you need an "applicator" to insert a tampon?
A video about "Amsterdam" that opens with shots in Haarlem.  Well, whatever. Any Dutch city will do ...
Do you still have your cat?
Emma makes me feel so comforted i wish i could do that for her, i love her so much, she is like my best friend
11:51 scene
Emma’s dance moves will always be my favorite😭❤️
i used to watch emma religiously at the beginning of her youtube career and then just got busy with life so haven’t kept up. this video appeared on my recommendations and was so happy to find she’s still wonderful! have seen bits and pieces of all the recognition and fame she’s getting nowadays so wondered if she’d be different but love that she’s still chaotic, sweet, always thrifting(!) and being open and honest about her life 😍
💗
Loved the pace of this video... Felt like Europe 📹
Emma you cannot cut cheese like that 😂
thanks for taking me w u
The opening song has my heart
what model are your adidas shoes?
Haarlem pakt ook even z'n shine
i love the 'is that a fucking pigeon' quote. gotta love reminders of him
emma and her dad has the same aethetic and i loveee it i love them
Netherlands never looked so good! Thank you for that wonderful peek!
Oh David Griffiths ... charmed I’m sure❤
I have a file called “ Emma”
Deggings 😂
anyone else physically cringe at how she sliced the cheese ahaha. lengthwise!!
My God why use a KNIFE on a CHUNK OF CHEESE
loved this emma
I think the haul was the best part EVEr
my city :,)
Americans: “amsterdam, netherlands”  Also Americans: *start video with footage of Haarlem instead of Amsterdam*
Love Emma, but you definitely can’t cut the cheese like this 😅
the jean browsing being in the rhythm AH that's a satisfying edit
this video makes me feel so out of body it gives me anxiety 😭
14:31 CoHo readers: Scotty?
gave very mia from la la land for some reason
I love how excited you got about the funky sock shop 😆
I’m chamberlain too
ok but why didn't she just buy another suitcase to put additional items in rather than shipping lol
so funny I've never seen or used a tampon with an applicator (tampax??). we keep it loosey goosey here in Aus. 😂😂
I literally used to watch ur tutorial videos of how to iron patches onto clothing and now ur a millionaire chillin in europe wut the $hit
I lost my best friend 6 years ago in a horrible accident, we were 23. Emma reminds me so much of her in every way. It’s eerie but comforting. Hard to explain, but I love her. I appreciate her!
Please don't drink so much Emma, you're to gorgeous to be messing yourself up.
11:43 my favorite part of this video
Pls do someting for the environment and use a menstruation cup..
THIS VIDEO WAS DELICIOUSLY GOOD AND WELL EDICTED, PURE PLESURE I LOVE IT. I LOVE YOU OK?
Please add the arabic translate
EMMA WHERE ARE YOU? WE MISS YOU !!!!
aaah hah love the haul! her movement, the music 👯‍♀️
her videos just make me happy 🤍
The neck fit thing!😭😭😭 my mind told me that
I love the family team
The haul in the hall. Perfect
POV: beehives in nederland voor de eerste keer omdat ze van YKW houden
anyone knows the name of the stores that emma visited
wait every single tampom in the united states comes with a applicator? Thats crazy
You could try Old Amsterdam with the black label. That's pretty good old cheese. I am from Amsterdam. Nice to see you in Adam and around. You have probably left by now :) super nice video and style of filming. It's the first video of your I see. Also I see a comment underneath here saying you'd fit in here really well. I agree. Seamless haha ;) truly
For me it was the other way around. I once had a tampon with applicator which was so hard to use! Was super confused by the construction at first too haha super easy with a finger hey how hard can that be ;) for real
Never thought I’d be watching Emma buy tampons in Amsterdam but here we are and I’m living for it
My bfs mom knows ur mom so we are actually best friends 🫶🏼 just thought I’d let you know
my favorite girl ever. keep thriving queen
🇺🇸
best youtuber
looking for a is that a fucking pigeon comment, has no one read reminders of him ?
Emma needs to be a food taster ... I love watching her try foods and drinks and express what she's tasting like ... It's very interesting 💕
kinda late, but your vids make me feel like I’m traveling with you. I hope we become friends irl but yeah I’ll keep on dreaming 😴
i want a painting from that man </3 the cutest thing ever
Lol I didn’t know about these coffeeshops
I fuckin love her
why no one is talking about how she looks like timothée chalamet in those photobooth pictures??????
Michael Jackson - They Don’t Care About Us (Brazil Version) (Official Video) https://youtu.be/QNJL6nfu__Q
remembering i walked down the same streets and missing this unique city!😩😩 your combination of iced latte-cheese-bread reminded me how good the eats tasted there for me as a cheese person. and the whole vibe of amsterdam matches with you soo well, these vids are the reason we live emma thank you😔
The bee socks 😭
awesome editing
Emma https://youtu.be/BREkYOoKGW0
Anyone knows where the "socks" shop is located?
Omg love this whole series.

i just want to know if the Amsterdam 'coffeeshop' thing was true...😳
I might have just watched 11:52 like 6 times, too cute
https://youtu.be/mEDlb6znvGA John 3:16 romans 1:19-32
the best haul ever
I like watching emma because of her ibs poop descriptions...soo relatable!  I dont know anything else about her.. The swearing annoying but you mentioning poop is enough.. Have you ever got your poop analysed by a health company?  I travelled directly to the lab with my poop sample in my backpack to hand it in  I will get every kind of info from all my bacteria..my digestive enzymes..my ph...immune system   I think my ibs used to be like yours back im the day .   Its much worsw now and hence why  i really need to fix it aa its the soul cause of every bad thing   But keep talking poop poop girl
Where is your suitcase from ?
You two are such a great combination, and the music choices were gold.
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE SHOP WITH THE SOCKS?! i reeeaaaallyyyy want to go
your telling me u were in amsterdam NOW?
just so proud
i love timotheé chalamet
Be the voice of Iranian people🕊 #iran #women_life_freedom #مهسا_امینی #زن_زندگی_آزادی  #مرد_میهن_آبادی
12:13 lets appreciate the music being in time with the jean flipping that made me so happy
Speaking as a 63 year old father of 3, Mr Chamberlain I envy you. What can be better in life than to travel with your adult child. I also love your cinematography. Great job raising your child!
OMG THE OLD MAN WITH THE PAİNTİNGSS IM CRYINGGGG

9:24 the girls staring r pissing me off
naneto ni madam kapag may vlog parang lahat binayaran e OMG ANG GANDA LOVE UUU
cameraman reveal?
Why'd you cut your cheese like that?
I love it about coffeeshop   🤣i been looking for perfect coffee in a morning🤣🤣
It is so weird seeing her in my city, like I know exactly where are all those places are, I took pictures in that photo booth last year???
I’m literally obsessed ..:. STILL ❤SO GOOD
15:34 the grape escape
this video is painful to watch
I hope I'm right....I just subscribed and I think you might hate "shorts" as much as I do! I see NONE on your channel, thankfully. :)
I once had a hot chocolate listening to rnb at a, cafe there. 1996 winter.. 💝
Please be the voice of Iranian people❤
Not me finding out in this video that they're finally done with construction on one street lol
A chocolate Nijntje, so cute <3
Unlike the American, the Dutch sell cannabis to foreigners to make money out of people from different parts of Europe where Cannabis is illegal,  but they just don't consume it. It means that they are smart, and those  are who consume it are slow-witted because cannabis is a gate-way to heroin, cocaine and meth.
Just another overrated YouTuber, with no creative skills whatsoever, who feels the need to let us know she's sending her crotch rot smell clothing home by post
That first coffeeshop will send you into another dimension 10/10 recommend, owner is dope too
Why am I watching this mommy…I mean mommy…I mean mommy…I mean mommy
When I first saw tampons WITH applicator I was like wtf? How should that work? I had to read the instructions. It was wild. I got raised with tampons without applicator. It's also more environmental, if you don't always use plastic applicator for every tampon. You just need to wash your hands before you change tampon. Easy as that 👌
I smell Nederlands
This was beautiful!
I need to bring my dad to Amsterdam 😂
The fuck off socks🥺
❤❤
do americans only use tampons with applicators??? huh
"what's a lose, tampon." knocked me out
Where can I score me a pair of THEM FRAMES, Emma, my friend?  Veel dank en groet!
I need that cat shirt. Where’d you get it? I feel like I’m so alone in life but then I remember I have my cat who has taught me everything in the past year. I love her. <3
I wanna see emma off an edible
I feel like she’s just this mature, grown woman now who’s rich and doing whatever the hell she wants bc she can! Lol I’m so proud of her 🥹
2:03 moonwalk dog.. Groetjes uit Amsterdam..
I love How u Can feel that Shes getting healthier and happier. It’s amazing love u emma❤❤
I love how the music is synced with her looking through the jeans 😅
I love Amsterdam so much. Man I miss it. We were there in February 2020, literally JUST before covid happened. It was the last time we've been there and now we've got a little one so travelling is a little bit different ^^ But I can't wait to go there again once he's a bit older! Such good vibes
Me as a European literally didn’t get what the problem is with the tampon until she explains it 😂😅🙈
Does anyone know what levis jeans she's wearing at the beginning of the vid?
Yay Amsterdam, my country❤
It feels weird to see a very famous American person walking around in the country where I live🤣
As a french, i'm sorry but she has to learn how to cut cheese.
She always finds like just the cutest things while shopping and I can’t comprehend how.
#mahsa_amini
#mahsa_amini
anyone know where her black purse is from?
you were here and you didnt say anything emmaa?!?!?!?!
i just discovered you and oh god girl, u re so comforting
13:51 cuts back to her eating the soup. Love it.
the shots used when filming this video are so good. well done :)
the haul just reminded me of her hauls in previous years and i almost sobbed
fantastic video
no cause everytime i visit family there i can only find tampons without applicators and it's the worst thing in the world
I just wanted to come here to tell you that you have close to 2 BILLION views on youtube, love seeing u grow!!!❤️
emma’s vlogs are so refreshing
zijn hier überhaupt Nederlanders?
Emma buy space saver bags to put your clothes in your luggage!!!!!!!
this video is just so... european, I love it 🤍
🇬🇭 men at 9:50 ☺️they were talking about food lol
so much calm so much chaos
She looks so happy.
je conseil au président Ukrainien de démissionner de ces fonctions.
Nous allons attribuer les territoires Russes je demande au président Ukrainien de démissionner de ces fonctions nous allons reconstruire l’Ukraine 🇺🇦 il reste une grande partie de territoire Ukrainien le président Russes a fait sont choix avec discernement et retenue.
yes
Any parent would be so proud to have Emma as a child. She is soooo awesome.
I love Emma so much. Loved from her first videos.
ART
Love the socks
someone I know you took a bereal of someone I know
i always forget she's only like 20 years old
I LOVE YOU EMMA
those pupils Emma... youre not high on weed, and its just weirdly noticeable
this is the best youtube video I have EVER seen!!!!! Emma you're an artistic genius and we are all here for it. Love that your dad is included too, youth have such an amazing bond. Love you so much! This is perfect.
Is she adopted? Where is her mom? Not trying to be mean just genuinely curious :(
#mahsaamini   Not only iranians, but humanity would appreciate, you using your platform to raise awareness for what's going on in Iran. a young 22-year old was beaten to death because her hair was showing, And now they are killing the protesters to mahsa amini murder. We want to live in a Peace this propaganda that media release is not Iranian people which all women wear chador. Must of women and men don't believe in Islam thing that government push to believe with force.  we don't have basics human rights, isn't dedicated any budget for education, they plunder all resources such as oil, gas, water. Deteriorate the whole climate of Iran. We don't want this terrorist government that interferes in the region. They have been killing and arresting so many people in the streets, Human rights activists and environmental rights activists. Iranian people have a long history and culture they are kind and friendly, this government doesn't deserve to represent IRANIAN. By you using your voice, You would help us, since the government has shut down our Internet. Talk about it we need to be heard❤
That haul was FIRE
Emma's overall style has changed sm but in a good way. There's more of a cinematic feel to her shots and editing :,). It's so cool to see her grow as a creator.
I honestly just started watching your videos recently, but you are so fun and I absolutely love your editing style 🤍🤍
does anyone know what camera she uses?
ayy at least you got the best brand of tampons girl
JESSE HOEFNAGELS
someone please tell me the name of the sock shopp!!! :D
Rewatching again
Yawn. Me, me, me. Seriously, what's the point of this vid? Narcissistic dribble.
I miss the weekly emma vlogs
Amsterdam is overrun with tourists, unfortunately, who often think it is a sort of open-air museum. As a result the residents, especially in the centre, have to put up with a lot of noise, pollution and these stupid cheese shops that no Dutchman would ever enter.
9:35 that’s nijntje from Dik Bruna. It’s a children’s book character
I love how shocked she was when finding out about european tampons😂😂
boring
Which is the model of the sambas she wears?
the bunny on the chocolate is called ‘nijntje’ :))
How did you buy stuff from Albert Heijn? Do you have a dutch card? People are gonna think you can just go in there with any card and buy stuff. This is borderline, misinformation. 😂
The brave women of Iran are sacrificing their lives on the streets against oppression and injustice. Please be our voice❤️‍🩹🕊️
emma in those mammon sunnies
The Islamic regime in Iran is killing people in the streets, mostly teenagers and children, arresting many people, the internet was restricted for days because they are afraid of the world's reaction. This protest is not just nakedness, it is a revolution. Iranian people do not want Islamic regime. Please be the voice of brave Iranian women. #Muhasamini
lol America is weird with their applicator things - most countries don't have them
Where was the photos boot, I need to do that!
The intro are shots like de mill are of Haarlem, where I live, close to Amsterdam:)

💙💛
In the Netherlands we most of the time do not have applicators, I’m sorry
Thanks for this video 🥰🙏
the Beatles shirt is IT for me 😍
very camp
Where’s your black top from it’s nice as 😊
been depressed af for the past 2 weeks i’ve gained like 6 pounds but this video actually brought me a lil but of euphoria
Emma, it’s been a long journey with you, but after all these years, I think it’s time for a fulllll closet tour 😄
Emma confused about a 'Loose Tampon" is the same way I felt when I found out other places around the world have applicators to put your tampon in 😭 New Zealand girl here where we just have to go fingers in, no help.
she such vibe when she ate that I LOVE HER
Amazing content. Your dad is so good at shooting videos. The images were calming and accurate and your energy is always so good to watch honestly. A day in Emma's life, in Amsterdam. Simply beautiful. That's all.
I CANT believe Americans only use tampons with an applicator?? lmao. just put it in haha
Hahaha lol! I had the tampon story in reverse! I was in California the past three weeks and was wondering why I couldn’t find ‘normal’ tampons without the shooting rocket attached to it 🚀🤣
Love that you are wandering round my home streets of Jordaan!! And you went to the Hoxton photobooth!!
NIJNTJE!!! <333
https://youtu.be/cOfI4t1EqnA
We love you Emma
whats the vibe with vaccine passports, me and my family are unvaccinated and would love to go there on holiday?
I just moved to the Netherlands to study abroad and the tampon thing was a nightmare at first but basically all you do if apparently you push it in with you pointer finger aiming for your lower back until it hits the base of you finger
❤
OMG love it!! i live in the netherlands. amazing that u visited. altho i think groningen or drenthe is the most beautiful
Euhhh what is a tampon applicator? Yes I’m from the Netherlands btw
no coffe no worry !!!
So many comments about Emma’s dad’s great video skillz. Yeah! This is why we need more art classes in schools! He’s been studying art for like 20+ years. Knowing about art can help you make your world more beautiful and help you realize just how beautiful the world around you really is! ❤❤❤
I love the candid, chaotic style of Emma's vlog, but her take is very much an American outside their comfort zone in Europe... not necessarily any tips, knowledge or experienced gained here specifically about Amsterdam. :/ Applicator-less tampons are the norm in western europe.
The brave women of Iran are sacrificing their lives on the streets against oppression and injustice , please be our Voice  #mahsaAmini
I………….. am obseSSed with Emma Chamberlain.
if it bleeds. we can kill it.
The haul in the end was amazing, i literally almost cried
ahahhahaha so funny that you‘ve never seen a „loose“ tampon😂 like why do americans need a big plastic aplicator i don‘t understand
Sure hope Emma compensates his dad for being her videographer
The brave women of Iran are sacrificing their lives on the streets against oppression and justice. Please be our voice #mahsaamini

Dumb question: but where is even Amsterdam? I’ve heard of it before & I’ve heard so many people talk to me about it but they never mention where it’s out & I’ve been so curious to where it’s located at
i love this father-daughter duo videography!
The brave women of Iran are sacrificing their lives on the streets against oppression and justice . Please be our voice #mahsaamini
I think I stayed at that hotel in Amsterdam as well. Such a good hotel. Their breakfast is the bests! I love that it wasn’t a continental breakfast but just something from a menu 😊 also yes as a Dutchie I always have to think coffee shops abroad are actual shops where you get your coffee haha
She gives me the Michael Scott vibe and I love it soo much!!!
14:32 is that a fucking pigeon?! Reminders of him<3

This video was so good. Like I cant even explain how enjoyable it was to watch
I was going to make a poopy comment but I could'nt remember who I was going to make it for,, then I remembered, it was Emma! actually I thought maybe it would be funny,,?,, better keep your mouth closed,,when you laugh,, here goes,, (I forgot the joke I thought of,,  I will message myself and tell you later when I remember it later!) and I never forget! it just spins around in my head from front to back,, I will retrieve it later! 🤗

Who the fuck watches these
absolutely surreal to see emma buy tampons at the supermarket i go to weekly and have coffee a corner away from my work... what
HOE WIST IK NIET DAT ZE IN NEDERLAND WAS!!!!!
Emma discovering tampons :) In Europe they are something very normal, I used them since middle ages! :)
This video is amazing
I went to the Netherlands and have a box of Dutch tampons to prove it.
Emma would be able to live in Europe, particularly the Netherlands. She’d adapt so well.
Is it weird that this is the first time im watching one of her videos. I know literally nothing about her but now i get why people like her. 👍🏻

Mahsa Amini was one of the hundreds of victims. She was beaten up to death, only because not covering a woman's hair is considered a crime in the Islamic constitution which is not approved by millions of citizens. However , objecting equals death, improvement or torture. #mahsaamini 🌱🫂🤍
Iranische Frauen kämpfen für Freiheit und Gerechtigkeit. Wir brauchen Ihre Hilfe, um ihre Stimme zu verstärken! Bitte stehe zu uns.🇮🇷🤍 #mahsaamini

emma ate a miffy chocolate that is so cute ahaha
But how much was that shipping LMAO
Damsko place 2 b!
Omg
Who takes care of Emma’s cats while she’s away for months? Cats can get depressed wo their owners :/
Fly in the soup 🤮
I felt like I was watching an episode of the office and I loved every minute of it ☺️
Does anyone know what chocolate store and photo booth she went to??
AD just did a piece on Emma’s new home. Nov. issue. I saw a write up on CNN.
Seeing your video in Amsterdam makes me happy, I am a foreign student studying in Amsterdam currently, I hope you enjoy the vibe here ❤

the best travel show on youtube!!
Emma eating pain au chocolat with coffee and cheese with bread, she's becoming French, sorry to say that
how is miss Emma cutting cheese  at 12:48 😭 what a crime
Finally a nice realistic view on Amsterdam 🙏🏽  Also I really love your personality!! But.. What did you do to the cheese.. 🥺 Ouch
nope, my scissors got confiscated at the airport
What’s a loose tampon 🤣
u were noticeably miserable before shipping ur sht, as soon as u gave urself permission to shop u sparked af ✨🌷
Oh my God I was in Amsterdam recently as well 🥹 what were the exact days of Emma’s trip?
i love you with my whole heart
I cringe at how Americans pronounce the word croissant but because it’s Emma I’ll allow it ❤ Haul done in the hall, love it 👌🏾
Love the vintage emma style
She needs a travel show !
DEAD not the coffee shop mix up HAHAH
Now I really wanna try american chocolate😂
If my dad and me would be filming this, it would be the most boring vlog ever because i wouldn’t even dare to do all these things in front of my him 🥲😂😂
te AMO
When are they going to cast the live action movie of Coraline and cast Emma
The flipping of the jeans in sync with the jazz beat…. Art
god i love emma chamberlain
This might be a dumb question.. but couldnt she have just bought a luggage and paid extra when flying back home?
Emma is just so adorable i love her
wtf a tampon with an applicator?
I love her omg 🤣❤️
Ajjaaj🤣
Emma!! We have a loose tampon in Australia, it’s very normal here hahaha
The way that guy is just casually dragging his rabid dog while still sipping his coffee, not even bothering to look back on why the dog is going nuts🤌
That moment walking out of the postal 🎉 exhilarating!! I knew that shopping trip was about to pop off.
I need her sunglasses info ..!!
Beautifulانتي جميلة❣❣❣❣❣❣❣❣❣✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌✌🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹✌✌
okay I NEED A HOUSE TOUT SO BAD EMMA
💙💙💙💙💙
3:18 WHERE IS THIS MUSIC FROM?!  It doesn’t say in the description and it’s the most prettiest thing I’ve ever heard. I’m losing my mindddd
12:13 Omggg
I'm very fond of you traveling with your pops- I hope you are making good memories together!
I loved this video so much
but the real question is ... CAN you bring scissors on a carry-on?? 🤔
i think she is so cultured. fashion, taste in food
Call of duty😮😮😮
lovely video, Emma.
the dog & dance breakdown yes
The haul reminded me of Emma’s old videos i love it sm
who takes care of your cats when you are always leaving
Shulla called muy
i loved this video so much! it would make a great series for all the cities you visit. actually, OB does bleach their tampons despite saying they don't as most tampons brands. if the cotton is white then it's definitely been treated chemically as natural & organic cotton is off white by nature.  p.s: also when in Europe NEVER carry your phone in your back pocket like that, it's literally an invitation for someone to steal it
When shes not trying the real coffeeshops 🤬🤬🤬
Emily in Paris is shaking
the ppl at 11:52 😭
Where did you buy your jumper? It’s so beautiful
The bee in the soup 🍲🤣
17 minutes best spent of my day  thank you emma
WTF who cuts cheese that way?????????? Omg i can’t 😂😂😂
Do you notice how Emma never says goodbye, it’s so intentional. It creates this expectation and notion that she is still there or traveling along the way, we’re just taking breaks in between the next time we meet. Virtually none the less. Brilliant
The miffy chocolate bar<3
8:52 I need one of his paintings 🥺
Can't you just buy more suitcases and pay for luggage at the airport 😭😭😭
احسها صارت ممله مو نفس اول
anyone know where emma's yellow lense glasses are from?
Best vlogs in town
Me wondering if it’s Emma’s dad recording or Emma’s dadddddddy recording
I love how emma doesn´t know how to use a tampon without applicator and I (a dutch person) don't know how to use a tampon with an applicator, I tried it once, it didn't work out
I love the little segways of people living life on the streets, it captures so much natural beauty that we sometimes overlook on our day to day lives ❤️
Emma in de appie!!
Plssss do a week without coffee as a challenge :)
was that a reminders of him reference
you have michael scott energy
Nice...............👍👍👍👍👍👍
8:57 i want one 🥹😭
I think its mad how emma is still only 21 and is like a globetrotter extrordinarre......
I dont know why, but I continue catching Michael Scott vibe through the whole video
where is that sock shop?
Ship your clothes home ? Excuse me but at least respect Dutch people when you are in NL. They care about environment so much so you can learn something from them. To not sh&$t to environment so badly.
great editing job
Please keep on making videos. Your humour your style your vibe… they are just so unique! Thank you
ohhh i wish my dad never went out for the fuckin milk!
I has this same experience about 2 weeks ago in Berlin… honestly am now into being able to fit a whole pack of 8 tampons in my purse
I’m really just trying to be you when I grow up fr 💕 I love the videography but still personal feel to every video.
“ThE cHeEsE aNd ThE cHoCoLaTe HeRe ArE sErIoUsLy BuIlT dIfFeReNt!!!”  “No, I get it. It’s like shut the @#$& up”  The best part of the video in my opinion. Captures Emmas chaotic neutral personality perfectly.
Girl you better go back and get the bob ross socks
12:12 - 12:15 when she synced the music perfectly to her flicking through the jeans
I really wanted to enjoy the video, but the background music was just too hard to ignore 😩😩😭
Your emotions seem to me to be very deregulated..! I believe, you have Schziodefective disorder coupled with ADHD. Can you confirm in your next vid...? 🤔 By the Way, your recent Vids are a Good Example...! Europe needs Tourists (post COVID, Plus other Stuff). They have (2) Years of Wages to make up for...!?!
this is ART  omg the way the music blended perfectly with emma looking the jeans???? are you serious???? pure gold !
Emma keep doing what you're doing I love you from Texas
The hail was the best part 🤓😂❤️
I have a house there it’s a great place
24 hours non stop smoking weed with emma would be a good video idea
this is the perfect hangover cure
I love watching these vlogs of Emma's while drawing, they have such a soothing quality and it's always fun to see the sights that Emma and her Dad explore together :)   This is going to be a random question but...does anyone know the outro music that Emma uses here?  (also Im sorry for not being tech savvy and having a timestamp link thingy) https://youtu.be/ZSUzODWPIdE?t=1031
top top top
i just love emma she gives me peace
Her gglasses? Any one please tell me the brand
OMGASHHH MAH HOME TOWN, welcome in Amsterdam girl 💙🙏🏽 you re the best!
her dad's videography style reminds me of quirky european movies
What's with the middle ages music XD
How do millions of people watch this?
💖💖
Her jeans are amazing, they look so cool! Can someone tell me which levis are they? besides that. i really enjoyed this video <3
These videos just make me want to live
In South Africa our tampons are also loose haha
Ahhh, another American baffled by our not having tampons in single use plastic
Ever should come to the uk
Emmmma
luv u sm emma
As a dutchie I found the tampon situation so funny😂
Hahahaha it’s so weird to Emma in the Netherlands 🇳🇱😂
When traveling to Amsterdam, we hiiiighly recommend trying the Churros at the street food truck at Central Station  🤗 by far the best ones we ever had
I almost got mad at you for not getting hummus with blueberries but then your haul made my day <3
The first few shots are actually of Haarlem, also a beautiful city in the Netherlands 😃
I love her so glad I’m back to watching her videos ❤
Emma feels like my safe place
I wonder if Emma did plan on where to go like specific stores/cafés/any places when she visits a country because it looks like she randomly found interesting places.
14:32 Emma have you been reading Colleen Hoover?? ifykyk
My wife is dying to find that Hoop Charm Ring you wear in your other videos. Is there a link so I can buy it for her?
if it is 24 hours in amsterdam why does the video only have 17 minutes I don’t get it
Loved this!!! You're the best.⭐😊
There is a crazy addicting comfort in her vids 😭❤️
Did anyone else catch Emma quoting “Reminders of Him” my Colleen Hoover? Was that on purpose or accident?
love these films! x
Europe videos🫶
emma, i love u
not u eating Nijntje (the chocolate bunnny)
i'm 5 min in and didn't realize how much i needed to go to Amsterdam until this moment. plus those "coffee shops"... bonus.
i love emma but the way she cut the cheese made me gasp out loud
12:13 was satisfying af
I live in Amsterdam and I see a video going by on YouTube of 24h in Amsterdam. How nice, so I click on it and what do I see.... a totally different city.... Haarlem. Okay.... eventually it's just the intro and after that the whole video is very nice. It's the best place and I'm grateful to live in that beautiful place, especially when the sun is out.
i absolutely love these
"Is that a fuck!ng pigeon?" Does she know she just quoted Colleen Hoover? 😂
ur videos make me calm, u make me want to travel around, u r such an inspiration, keep doing u emma. Love u!
shit man i live in amsterdam and i didnt see you im gonna cry
I love love this video!!!
the shot choice with the music while sorting through the pants made me so happy
I just love Emma's dad's cinematography. As someone living in the Netherlands, she captured the beauty and the daily life of Amsterdam in such a beautiful manner. I feel like if Emma would just travel all around the world and only make videos about that I'd just watch it for my entire life. How amazing content! <3
I go to a lot of the places Emma went regularly! So crazy I just missed her!
I just love her so much... It hurts.....
emma's biggest cultural reset in the netherlands: tampons
Does anyone know where her sunglasses are from at the start??
My last name is chamberlain lol
everyone who listens to the podcast knowing exactly why she needed scissors
Emma : I’m not the type of person who does goofy dances on the internet   Also Emma : 15:33
As an European I waited for that tampon talk😂 and I love hearing it from Emma but I always thought that that plastic insert thingy is so much waste for each tampon it’s so unnecessary 😅
Those sunglasses 🧡
🇧🇪Ghent belgium walking through highlights https://youtu.be/qfhQBiMl9-Q
Emma je t’aime mais c’est pas comme ça qu’on coupe du fromage bordel
i live in america but i use ob tampons. it took a lil getting used to but they’re so much better for the environment & better for your body.
I love this woman so so so much #myfuturewife
Does somebody knows what bag emma is using at the start of the video? Thanks in advance
The Iranian government is burning the holy Quran, ripping the hijab off women, stripping women naked on the streets, blaming all these on the people who fight for their rights. Be our voice. These crimes are committed by the government in order to shut us down. #مهسا_امینی #OpIran
at 12:48 I love you but why would you cut the cheese like that
looooved the vid! still don't get over how not a single American woman knows how to use tampons without an applicator ahah
Hahaha I am from norway annd we use those kinds of tampons aswell. I dont know how to use the aplicator thing lol. Just get it up in there girly hahahaha!
i did alll of this but i had worms so it was really uncomfortable
im glad you and your dad liked it here Emma!
Emma in my streeet😍
i can't believe we get content like this for FREE.
11:51 my favourite shot
the way you got me out the house for once just to see if i would bump into you 😢
You make it easy to have sad eyes and it ok. Everyone is like "smile sweetie"  or some shit like that but thank you for being you! Fellow gem
She made me smile. Lovely girl!
How she put the cheese on the Bread, heart break for someone who Works with cheese🥲😂 love you Emma ❤❤
i love you emma
Pretty sure that’s Haarlem at the start 😊 nice style
Nice shades
why is the music so perfect
Emma I love you but who cuts cheese like that
So surprising she's not used a loose tampon 😮
You even look Dutch girl haha
IBS queen how have you ate this much dairy ? 😆
You have soo less problems you are creating them i would like to be rich
theres sm about Emmas vids thats so relaxing
What hotel is this?
*Emma eating the bread and cheese* Tell me why I played the Ratatouille scene when he's eating the cheese and strawberry together 💀
okay but does anyone know the brand and name of her purse???
i love the pigeon socks <333
Greattttt intro 😂❤
As a dutchie is weird to see Emma in Albert Heijn and POSTNL 😂
i literally want to be like emma when i grow up
Miffy!
cómo te quiero!!
The cheese store is givin ratatouille vibes🐀
i love emma😭
Wow…what a brat😂
Yesss please upload more
does anybody know what jeans she's wearing i lovee them
I had a lot of wine   ….you know what I mean? 😂
I wonder if there’s a random island that solely uses period cups and not tampons or pads and when they see them when visiting a different country they’re like what the actual fuck is this.
really want to know where she got that shady orange sunglasses from!
8:46 he is so cute, for some reason this scene made me cry 🥺
“is that a fucking pigeon?!”
Ehm... Amsterdam. But your intro shows the nearby city of Haarlem....
i really miss relatable emma at home, now we only get unattainable emma eating cheese in amsterdam...
the guy dragging his dog away casually while the dog's paw just glide in place is so perfect thank you for including this in your edit 🤣
I really love listen to Emma talking
The haul was everything❤
The haul bruv… the haul ❤
14:32 colleen hoover🥲
how she pay for her groceries at AH without a dutch card is my question
The first minute show's the city of Haarlem not Amsterdam..
❤
Chis in tha chakalate is very gud
there's something about these vlogs... love
Such a beautiful and calming way to present Amsterdam. Hope you had a great time! Hi from the Netherlands 👋
12:12 (the editing on beat, it's the lil details i love 🥰 )
11:52 (cutest moment💕)
I love Amsterdam♥️ I miss it 🥲
Ooo i like your outfit❤
Guys, does anyone know the name of the song Emma plays in the last 30 seconds? I’ve been trying to find it - please help!
Please make a video in Madrid for me
Please dont walk with your mobile in your backpocket esp in Amsterdam.  Did no one tell you😎
The iranian have been cut of from internet while word leaders are meeting at the United Nations. PLEASE BE THEIR VIOCE #mahsa-amini
THE PHOTOBOOTH PICS SHE LITERALLY LOOKS LIKE AN ACTUAL TIM BURTON CHARACTER
if ur heading to madrid spain, pls lmk and I swear I will give y’all the best cultural and gastronomical tour of the city. I also know some reeallyyyyy good coffee places you’d LOVE
as a dutch person i was so confused when i saw tampons with applicators for the first time, they basically don't sell them here😭
can anyone tell me, were some of these shots in Haarlem? or did it appear to be all amsterdam
I'm from the Netherlands and it's true. We don't use applicators for our tampons. I wouldn't even know where to get ones with applicators. The silk touch makes it easier to use them, see it as a kind of lupe 😂 It's meant for lighter days. Questionsssss about The Netherlands haha?
Emma I’m laughing OUT LOUD, alone LOL
So are we allowed to bring scissors on a plane?? can't believe she left us hanging like that???
first of, its so satisfying how the music and the movements sometimes match. second of all, I'm so happy emma have this kind of relationship w her dad where her dad learned so much about her
This track on the intro is fire, holy shit
“IS THAT A F*CKING PIGEON” I’m deceased😭 Iykyk
at 11:52 did we just witness the beginning of a love story??? was that girl asking for the guy's number??? help i need to know cause that was so beautifully captured
I feel like I'm watching a show on PBS in the most beautiful and nostalgic way
in aus we have tampson without the applicators, literally never used an applicator in my life 😭
omg the sgt. peppers shirt is so amazing
@wow the part where Emma matched the music with her shifting through the jeans at the vintage store😌
I’m so happy you found pigeon socks 😂
the cinematography in this video was impeccable
The bee, HAHAH 💜 loved it 😍
I could watch this for one hour straight. i love Emma's videos so freaking much. thanks for keep posting, love ya <3
I live your tripp fashion, life. Emma 😆
get a menstrual cup bb<3
I need to go coffee shops In Netherland
she's really out here just traveling the world, experiencing life with her pops. love to see it!
Come to Norway 🇳🇴
As an Aussie the tampon thing actually blows me away lol I’ve only ever used loose tampons… the applicator seems so unnecessary and wasteful to me. You literally just push it in with your finger 🤷‍♀️
I love how people are literally biking IN SUITS.
Girl I wish I had ur problems
the fact that her dad was filming it all, if there's one thing emma has that I envy more then anything else its her relationship with her parents.
I mean, those photo booth pics.....? They're are actually fire. 🫶🔥
Emma looks like a mom, and I like it.
as an aussie, your weirdo applicator tampons are crazy to me the way our loosey goosey ones are to you hahaha. ours are so small! you can stash em everywhere!
11:52 looks like a movie scene 15:27 as well
1:31 With how it's cut it seems like the waitress is speaking and emma is ignoring her 😂😂
Wine, chocolate, cheese, & coffee lol….How’s your tummy doin? 😂
Groetjes uit Amsterdam ❤
the man painting was so heartwarming
So if Emma isn’t a pigeon for Halloween I’m gonna rage
The way Emma cut her cheese really frustrated me
the way her dad videos stuff is incredible like he captures the little interactions between people that are maybe 5 seconds but it’s like they tell a story
15:41
the browsing of the pants in time with music. chefs kiss.
I brand new here yet i have found myself in a girl . Lets meet up
You're so cutsie, edgy, hip and foul, I'm sure you'll make some man very miserable.
I always look forward to your videos! I would love for you to check out mine <3
9:30... did I hear a Michael G. Scott in theeeere?? ❤️
where are emma's jeans from?
Does anyone know where her black sunglasses with yellow lenses are from?
HAAHHA Emma you're amazing - that haul! perfection. As is the whole video - living for these new videos!!
Her clothes are the size of my 6 year old's clothes. ;)
1) NO COFFEE SHOP SELLS DRUGS EXPECT FOR CAFFEINE, EVER! 2) ALL COFFEESHOPS DO sell COFFEE 3) NO CROISSANTS ARE LACED 4) NOBODY BUYS THESE BY MISTAKE, ESP NOT YOUR MOM
stop the little old man selling his paintings was so precious
no fucking way she went to the appie
its the energy of the haul for me!!!
Omg girl you are living life!
🤍🤍
Love these videos so much, I wanna go here!!
Just wondering. Who is behind the camera?
Should’ve went to a coffee shop lol
when you find the perfect pigeon socks for work and everything is right in the world
She looks like her and Timothee Chalamet both are related.
Uhhh I see Haarlem 😅
Reading from the comments, realizing it's her dad who is filming her (the good about it is that, I'll feel bad for anybody else filming this and having to listen to her annoying consumerism problems) the bad about it is, that it is borderline perverse sharing everything with your father. And - him agreeing on this is like - Britney's father - cashing in from her. It is kinda gross.
I’m obsessed with the haul part, perfect music selection 👍👍😂
Love to see your videos back!!! LOVE the editing and your dad cámara skill are on top.
Emma: "I feel something weird happening." Dog: moonwalks out of the frame
Amsterdam has been my favorite place I’ve visited ever 🥹🫶🏽 I need to go back now
hotel floor gives the shining vibes
❤️❤️❤️
Lol! That is Haarlem, not Amsterdam in the first 30 seconds 🙈
I really love this video, but the first 25 seconds of your video are not filmed in Amsterdam, but in another Dutch city: Haarlem.
14:32 AAAAA ANYONE WHO READ REMINDERS OF HIM?
The second I saw that old man painting on the street I sobbed 😢 he looks so peaceful
12:12
I love her videos more and more every time😭😍❤️
Lol, the first 20 seconds of the video is from a city called Haarlem... In a video about Amsterdam
16:39 where is this?
The first thing she mentioned not to do was the first thing I did an hour after arriving in Amsterdam :D Well.. I did got my coffee from the 'coffeeshop' ;D
That was the best haul ive ever seen
enjoyed this one em
oh honey, welcome to europe! here we just stick it in without any help.
Tampons with applicator are very wasteful in my opinion. All that plastic just to insert this one tiny little tampon. Why not use your hand, you wash your hands either way.
You look happy. I’m glad for you 🕊
First part of the video is actually in Haarlem, not Amsterdam 🙃
emma you just buy an extra suitcase....
WAIT STFU WHAT IS THAT SOCK STORE
Me grabbing the most expensive package of tampons every month: “I WANT THAT ONE”
the haul part gave back her older  videos vibes lowkey miss that
My dear in Europe we're such badass we just shove tampons up our vaginas! 😉 I strongly advocate for pads though
2:03 That dog doing the sickest moonwalk
The cheese and the chocolate here ☠️
How is no one talking about that bee!! lol 😂
I became obsessed with coffee because of her😭😭
thank you emma for allowing us to tag along for your sweet casual travels
This video was so wholesome. Lived in Amsterdam before the pandemic. Really brought back this warm vibe Amsterdam has
THE SONGS  #hardslay
love u emma 😌
i feel like if i were a girl id pick up the wrong tampons by accident 💀
I live in The Netherlands!!
Your dad loves you very much. Treasure him.  Also, your “haul” had me rolling!
wow I loved this
Emma please stay weird forever! It brings the world so much joy!! 😭😍🥰
oh to be emma chamberlain 😩✨
girl u gotta get on the menstrual cup bandwagon
okay but those butterfly shorts fomooo
love the clip of the couple after she pet the dog
This video was so fun. I missed Emma
WHERE R UR GLASSES FROM ( the ones in intro)
Featureman sent me
your editing style brings me so much peace
you are LIVINGGGGGG
i dont really understood with tampons, never use it and i dont think it's quite healthy compare to pads.
i miss chaotic editing
the shot of that one couple <3
Love the Akilas
hiiii Emma, good to see another video finally. So Emma, have you ever thought to have a clothing store of your designs or of your most iconic looks? it will be definitely the best store ever. :)
the cheese store was beautiful
Was hoping to see idk… Amsterdam.  not drugstores and hotel rooms.
wine on other countries got me so drunk. same
EMMA ROCKIN COOL SOCKS!
THESE EUROPE VLOGS ARE GREAT!
i love these vlogs so fucking much
the haul part lol😭
Omg that cute old guy selling paintings!!! His smile of someone buying one!!! Awww!!!! Made me tear up🥹❤️ I would buy one of those in a heartbeat 💓
I love Emma so much
you should go to berlin too
This is just a normal tampon to me lol I wouldn't even know how to use an applicator... such a weird cultural difference
Yeah we wanna see a video about tampons...nice
What’s a loose tampon 😂😂😂😂😂
i love the new videography 🤍🤍
come to ldn omg
Emma almost every clip 🏃🏽‍♀️
8:12 when you had too many magic pains au chocolat
... It boggles the mind that in America, an average of 73 million women all over the country, use plastic applicators to put in a tampon, every 4 hours, five days a month, once a month. Like. The amount of plastic applicators that are manufactured, boxes that use more materials than "loose" tampons since they're bigger, and the fact that these applicators are used for only a few seconds and then forgotten by the consumer, when it takes hundreds of yesrs to decompose... It hurts my brain and my heart. Make smarter choices. It starts with you, not the big companies. Your choices and demands dictate their actions and products.
I remember watching you just chill around San Francisco complaining they wouldn’t highlight your hair more and now here you are traveling the world as a beautiful blonde. Slay Emma slay.
I would’ve freaked out bec of the bee
that video just saved me
come to portugal!
I loved the shot at 11:57 it’s so sweet and just love how cute the couple looks in front of the adorable architecture
Ugh I miss Amsterdam so much and Emma's relationship with her Dad is so wholesome I could cry
I want to be friends with her and her dad so bad
your videos are pure dopamine! I enjoy every moment it's so peaceful
Love youuuu
The Episode vintage stores in Amsterdam are amazing!!  In video the one at Berenstraat but also at Spuistraat, Waterlooplein and Spiegelstraat you can find them. The first few shots were shot in Haarlem not Amsterdam. In Haarlem there is also one Episode store at the Jansstraat 🙂
i’m in poland and the tampons are the same!!! had me so confused lmfao
what do you think of the Forum Groningen?  https://youtu.be/3AaS9NTxXaA
Does anyone know where Emma’s sunglasses are from?
The Beatles shirt slapssss
Okay, I have to make a comment after seeing the tampon clip. The first time I ever got the crimson wave I had to use a loose tampon. No one explained it to me and I thought that was just how it was… then like a long time after I figured out that tampons with applicators existed and I was so mad 😂
waste not want not=O.B.  <3
the reminders of him reference!!!
what sunglasses are those? i love them
My god those tampons are so cheap, I hate this country(america)
her face looks like timothée chalamet kinda, like her facial structure is similar
16:40
The tampon situation is so funny. I am European living in the US and I feel like the applicator made me confused. Still don't know how to use it hahaha (also, I think its kinda wasteful)
the second vintage store that you visited was amazinggg! I went there too and I bought a beautiful dress!! every time i go to Amsterdam that store is my go-to place. they also have the best sunglasses
u would love Utrecht!
24 hours in _  but it's not even a 24 minutes video. Owhh Emma
She’s so unwatchable and boring now
the vibe of these videos is so relaxing i love living vicariously through you emma <3
I miss your old vlogs where i can feel lonely and feel okay about it
they have tampons with aplicater at kruitvat
there are no tampons applicators here in argentina nor in many countries ajjajajaj
I love her! Send Love from the Netherlands ❤
when the beat of the music matched every single time she flipped to a next pair of jeans
In argentina we don’t use applicators either! Plus the environment sis
what's the name of the BGM,the guitar  part?
Emma asking why she bought scissors when we all know it’s because of some shirt she has that has a tag on it lol
shes officially back ladiessss. new era.
painter maan damn my heart melted he is so cute<3 i love u even more emma everytime i hang out with u , much love to  ur dad <3
Thank you Emma!!!!
i am actually so honored to share a name with this queen.
obsessed with the levis! does anyone know what style? lol
Emma, you're made for Europe
drink every time she says “you know what i mean?”
Loving your channel Emma! You inspiring my cooking and my workout routine! Sounds mad  but true! Keep it up! DIG!
Porque nadie habla del suéter verde 😩😩
The first minute is why I loved it in Amsterdam this summer! This is stunning cinematography! I love this new content
Yes Emma haul 15:21 best part
Video 100000000 about Amsterdam. The city where Dutch people don't go b/c of it's high crime rate, dog poop, parking misery, aggressive people, overpriced food and drinks and tourist, tourists, tourists, tourists and tourists. The Netherlands is10 x more beautiful outside this sewer city.
visit sidemen it would be fun tho !!
Emma in Albert Heijn!
the sgt pepps long sleeve is amazing
the simplicity yet chaotic vibe is just 🤌🏼
bro you are NOT supposed to cut cheese like that in NL
“I have to be intentional about my purchases”  Buys 2 x pairs of pigeon socks 😂😂
I love you em ❤
“Is that a fucking pigeon?” I wonder if Emma has read Reminders of Him by CoHo 😱
EMMA EMMA EMMA YOU NEED TO GO TO THE EFTELING ITS A THEMEPARK ITS AMAZE
why did the scene with painting grandpa just made me cry
the "is that a fcking pigeon?" reference😭
nothing more dutch than that albert heijn bag
Haarlem represent
absolutely love how the first couple of shots aren't Amsterdam at all
I love her appearance because she looks like someone Tim Burton would cast in his movies
I bet Emma and her dad were chilling together one day when Emma suggested: "Let's visit the most aesthetic cities in the world, try new things and have fun." And this is how we have these aesthetic, gorgeous traveling vlogs :".
Euw this is so cringe.
🤌🤌🤌
So naar jesse hoefnagels
How did they accept your card in Albert Heijn check out😭
Does anyone know what camera she is using?
i started my period in amsterdam too ! ! crazy. love you emma
Im from Amsterdam and im very proud that she visited Amsterdam. 🥰
dying over the Sgt peppers shirt!
Frankfurt next, thanks in advance!
Just take a bag carry on to ur trips
High af in amsterdam
Je zal dr maar tegen komen in de stad…
Another typical American doing out of place American things in Amsterdam
17:11 I want to look this good in my next life
Next time you should come to Rotterdam!!!!
How to even use an applicator
Where can I find those sunglasses!!! 😮
emma and her dad healing my soul once again
Emma literally brings me so much joy
So no one saw the lady ask her man for money and he just pulled out his wallet…😂😂
The music lined up with the jeans shot was amazing and so satisfying
I need to know what style Levi’s she is wearing with the black top. Like please someone help I neeeeed them 😂🫶🏻😩
Pigeons are my fav animal too (beside cats!)
Australia has those tampons too, we see the American applicators as comedic hahah.
Everyone's praising the cinematography, but can we talk abt how the music ties it all together?
Im a fan of the dog being dragged away in the background
Obssessed with the direction of your content Emma! You are a queen 😭😍 please keep it coming! You make me want to travel so bad 😩
Emma - cut a whole bunch of shaggy layers in your hair like Meg Ryan in the 90s so cute
Why would you not just buy a bigger suitcase and keep all your clothes with you????
I love the comments here they match my thoughts as well love this community and Emma❤ so happy I found this space and her in this time of my life.
love
She's jus saying out loud how her brain processes the world and it's comfortinh that everyone relates
Once I watched a bee drown in tomato bisque and I understood
Emma, if you still have issues with your digestive system try 1 or 2 teaspoons of bee pollen granules daily. It has multiple health benefits including resolving many gut problems. Good luck.
Love this! Brand new and still the best Emma. A haulllll! Ha! Yes
thats actually lit about the coffee shops
the amount of serotonin this video gave me!!
its funny cause going thrifting, I find myself saying the same. "I'll leave these for someone who fits them perfectly" but then I start to think about how what if the wrong person gets them and also wants to tailor them and just doesn't know how to wear them... and then I just end up buying it
This reminds me of a Samantha Brown travel show my mom and I used to watch when I was little. 🫶🏼 Emma needs a travel show!!!!
The try on hall was too good Emma, love u sm I hope you’re doing well
I was going out of my mind about this couple's shot like idk why I love them so much like when I saw them I felt like I wanna really see them if you know what I mean like I wanted a movie for them or something
what shoes is she wearing?
i love this white girl sm😭💛
Ugh why do her videos always have to end. She just needs to make each one like an hour lolll
you are art
24 hours in colombia pleaseee
come to iceland next!
This is like therapy for me, idk
you are comfortable talking about your period and shopping for tampons with him is chefs kiss
What camera do you use?
T AMOO
was that a reminders of him by colleen hoover reference lol
I didn’t watch this not once but THRICE it was that good
The background music is so peaceful but is the name of the song @ 15:00 called “Ukraine War Sounds” from an album called “Instrumentals For World War 3” 😭😭😭😭
I love you
“The cheese and the chocolate here are built different” whoa I didn’t know you had that in you lmao. You’re awesome
This editing style gives me Terrace House vibes. I love it!
no bc it's so cool that i was littrally there!
If I had the carry on issue abroad. I would simply by a cardboard box that fits the checked-bag size criterion. Then I would stuff it with the extra stuff I need to bring back. If traveling internationally, many airlines allow the first checked bag to be free
I can't even explain how much i love Emma's vlogs
I have followed Emma since I was a pre teen and this whole time I thought she traveled alone
Amsterdam is so chic and artisanal in some places but also so eery and unsettling in others
your dad's artistic eye from doing his plein air paintings makes these videos absolutely stunning, emma. so proud of you both ❤
I'm a first time viewer, and I was almost going to turn you off within the first 60 seconds before I paused it, read some of the comments, then thought I would give you 2 more minutes, at least for YT credit. Bottom line? No one can blame you for continuing with this quirky, off balanced personality formula. You've 11.8M subs, and by the comments, you're over-weighted 95% female. But that is what saves you. I have to assume the female audience is still in their teens. Yet, who cares, right? The money is big!
2:02
Does anybody know what shoes she is wearing?
does anyone remember the video in which she wears her paul mccartney shirt???? IMPORTANT
Jeeeezz! The filming and editing are just soooo good
I love love love love this serie of videos. The cinematography is incredible and it's so peaceful. Thank you so much for making these !!!
these videos are better than anyone from hollywood with a budget dude!!!
emma is an anthropologist
*i watched this waitin for the bus, thanks for the company emma!*
My dad passed away last week at the age of 52 because of a tumor. I love watching your videos with your dad, now even more, as they remind me so much of my beautiful relationship with mine and give me so much comfort and support in this difficult time❤
love it that she still goes on holiday with her dad
A. I love the b roll at 11:52 because this couple have a cute interaction. B. 12:13 is synced I love it
She’s the main character fr
rich ppl problem to be able to send clothes home because they wore them "too much" honestly I bring only 2 dresses and use the pants I'm wearing when I go on holidays, and I know that's probably the only thing I'll be wearing 😂 so those 6-7 pieces of clothes that she HAS to send home while her suit case is still full of clothes, yeah it's not life threatening but sure it's cool.
I'm American but totally don't miss applicators. It's super nice just to slide these in your pocket or handbag. So discreet - Welkom bij Holland!
I wouldn't be surprised if Emma starts her fashion label
These videos bring me peace
que saudades que eu estava de um hall dançante
Traveling with emma is just her vintage shopping and drinking coffee in different places
I was not aware that tampon applicators existed until I visited the US. In Central Europe you just use your finger lol.
I LOVE MY EMMAAAAA
huge credit to Michael Chamberlain 👏
these are the best videos to eat lunch to
Emma - I think you would be amazing as an ambassador for a specific charity or social cause that you highlight more on your channel - it would be awesome for you to open your world up to something more meaningful and you would bring so much fun, interest and audience to whatever you would highlight.  You are amazingly talented and fun to watch and it is obvious that you are ready for something more.
Emma taught me a new vocabulary word with this video: "gleeked"
this video made me laugh :) I really needed that.
What shoes is she wearing!!!
girl i am laughing my ass out i'm from Holland but why do you cut the cheese like that. hahahha
emma is the woman i inspire to be. traveling, cats, fashion, sounds like the perfect lifestyle to me 🫶🏻
I love this woman so much
the dawg's eyelashes <3
I visited amsterdam for the first time, actually came back home from my trip yesterday and it was so much fun! love this city.
Prettty impressive videos
As a Dutchie, it was so funny to watch this video because the openingshots (before Emma was shown) were all filmed in Haarlem (my hometown ❤️). Can’t blame them, I also prefer Haarlem to Amsterdam 🤭😉
Fire Drip
How can I make you amends for such a gift 🍬🎾💛
where is that cat sleep shirt from i need it
i love u
Love this! That gentleman painting on the street was So adorable! Thank you and your papa for sharing with us 🥰
Emma is so gorgeous, I absolutely adore her and love her editing skills; its as though she is speaking my language, just for me lol ;) Btw that light train is hella sketch
I will be running to every coffee shop😂
american chocolate is ass
The dog was so cute
her try on haul is on another level...loving it
12:56 your so funny Emma , love uuuu
Half your intro is made in a different city: my hometown Haarlem, which is not Amsterdam (!). Please mention that as well hahaha
we used to have applicators here, but they removed them lmao
Where are her sunglasses from?
such an awesome video emma 😊 did you get one of these special chocolate croissants? 😅😁
that your in 2022 still using aplicators is so grossd to me. HEELLLLLOOOOO THE ENVIRONMENT!!!!!!!
SENİ ÇOK SEVİYORUM EMMA come Istanbul,Turkey
A thousand sock options *can't decide, option overload* *GASP PIGEONS* *hesitation gone, time to leave*
I watched Caseys, then I watched yours...yours was better : ) Great filming!
The haul part was a fcking piece of art.
Elevators don't speed up if you keep pushing the button...hahahaha.
emma said 'is that a f*cking pigeon' and somehow i thought of scotty and ledger
I can’t with you! What’s a loose tampon??? 😂I would have been like seriously??? I just started. I at least need a super right now. Sheesh. Love your videos and podcasts!! Your style, your Aura is so awesome! Love the haul😂 Take care! ❤
The Netherlands, thankyou 🤣
I love Emma's sweater, does anyone know where it's from?
The starting part I walk there every day TT
Is that a fucking pigeon?
i love emma sm omg
Your video editing now kinda gives me Amelia’s chicken shop date vibes but less awkward
Have y’all ever had to use a cardboard tampon that shit is fucking crazy
My city!!!! Yay!
Wish you had your own documentary movie ! 😮🥰
yeah i’m europe those tampons are much more commons hahha
this was like watching your fave comfort movie
I need that shades
24 hours of consuming yay
this feels like... this is not just youtube video. this is an art. really.. I was amazed everything that makes up this vid like videography, music, emma herself..really everything. emma you are genius. im for sure know it
11:52 the girl asking for the boy's number, it's just that
I was kind of waiting for her to make a drug haul 😅
i NEED emma to post more. shes so interesting
putting the jean flipping clip to the music was pretty nice editing, these videos are a very easy watch
Deggings
thank you so much
yoooo i really recommend using a diva cup dude, you put it and you can keep it for max 12 hours depending on your flow. but honestly its really life saving you should try and you can usually buy one at a drug store!
The carpet in your hotel reminds me of the carpets in The Longreach Hotel in ‘The Shining’!
Yess, those are my favourite apples too.
I hope Emma never stops traveling, these are her best videos
Boring
WHEN THE JAZZ TUNE SYNCS UP WITH HER FLIPPING THROUGH THE PANTS
thank u for taking us with u on ur amsterdam adventure <3   ps. it felt like i was actually there w u
Jeez, swears like a sailor but, still a good video.
2:55 its giving mr bean’s holiday
She is my therapist
YESSSS MORE VLOGS!!!!💗💗💗
i think america is the only place with tampons w an applicator
I am loving her ‘24 hours in’ series. So excited for the next one. ❤
I love my city, nice to see you enjoy it aswel💪
definitely my favorite video ever! i love this, emma. and i love you so much
As a dutchie. I’m sorry… but the way you cut the cheese 😢 You should go to jail for that 😂
We want the old emma back I want you to film no camera man
now i wanna visit amsterdam also that creamy pumpkin soup got me hungry
Omg how good were the shops you went to?
This is a very beautiful city, I've always dreamed of visiting it
I don't understand, the girl returned the clothes to her house to walk lightly and in the end she bought clothes?
Appie nummer 1
This is next level
tampons and any thing that goes inside may cause serious infections than can go in your bloodstream to your heart and brain. switch to period panties - much safer and more environmentally friendly!
I like this video she kind of reminds me of a character from a Wes Anderson movie,but with too many F bombs to be in a Wes Anderson movie. The cinematography at times makes me think of Wes Anderson film style and that's a good thing.
Why didn’t I just buy another suitcase😂
Dad @0:56
Y’all Americans are the only ones who don’t raw dog it
The french in me died a little by the way you cut your cheese. Its fine, the nation still loves you Emma.
I need a whole goofy mukbang from you! 10/10 croissant content
why does everyone still love and support her? i have lost faith in humanity.
ايما ماودك تجين لبريده
watching Emma's videos makes me feel so happy and safe and toasty
emma brings me so much comfort omg
12:13 lol i love how the music lined up with her shuffling through the rack
https://youtu.be/pdzKmW40c0U
I wished for this edit to never end .. Dan Polanski anyone?
Adult edit Please ❤
Jesus, the filmmakers Charli Chap and Douglas Fairbanks
Looks like such a charming place. Can’t wait to go there
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I miss you so much! ❤️
im soooo invested in the two people at 11:52
I mean everything about the filming and editing is superb
no coffee, no workee is my new motto
Tattoo  her Daddy has a fat bank account. Travel to europe to buy  Made in America vintage clothing by way Oueens New York age 33 LOL
you and michael are everything and more. 💯💯
Junkies with money LOL
A high love the videos  think your cool can relate love ya keep rolling
is that a cashmere shweaterrr?
if this 24 hours in different cities is becoming her thing i cant wait for paris, madrid, buenos aires and mexico city which i doubt shell go to the last two cities
U make my days better ❤
i can't describe why but her vlogs are so therapeutic to me, I love how raw and chill she is. her vlogs just feel personal, like she is sending it to her best friend or something. thank you Emma
your kinda too cute
When she pointed out the f off socks and did the little shopping dance hall, I got so nostalgic for her sf days. I love the way she films her videos now, its really interesting to see how she's changed and evolved, but once in a while some aspects of her old self will make a comeback too. Never change Emma I love you <3
Does anybody else hate being alive?
Why would u ship stuff home instead of just buying more luggage there!!
That’s such a cute scene 11:52  Feels like a movie
Me right through the Vlog: this is such wholesome content. Me at the haul part: what the f*k is goin on 😂😂😂😂
this video was impeccable
Girl this video was next level. Have been LOVING your videos lately in general. But this one in particular, wow wow wow. A beautiful mix of casual and cinematographic at the same time -- really hit a sweet spot! Sending love 💛
Who films?
Go to coffee shops not cafes in Amsterdam- noted thanks!
the perfect duo
This is my favorite video of yours!
its so funny seeing Emma walking around in places I am so familiar with and being like wait I know that place!
beautiful cinematography
i need emma’s life it’s not fair i need it
i love you emma !!!❤❤❤
i love you emma
that pigeon socks kkkkkk
the way this made me not want, not crave, but - n e e d - a croissant
I remember visiting Amsterdam when I was little. Seeing the streets and feeling like I was there was amazing. Please continue to make these videos with your dad. It was so pleasing.
IS THAT A FCKING PIGEON
$2 for pads?!? I’m moving to Amsterdam
NIJNTJE
lmao @ the chocolate croissant
Wowwww
this video was my sunday reset. i love u emma
the old man selling the paintings!! so cute ugh
https://youtu.be/nrpdIQypycU ⬆️⬆️⬆️
I have to fight to find tampons with applicator 🥲🇺🇾 I always need to bring them from abroad
Come on, Emma We all know the scissors were meant for chopping weed and you didn’t wanna admit it 😂 Also explains why you forgot hahaha
Was anyone else kinda surprised that Emma doesn’t use a menstral cup? Just assume all the kids are up to date with all the new shizz 😂
14:31 was that a Reminders of Him reference?
I was here :)
the fact that your dad is filming you walking around talking about your period and tampons makes me think something weird is going on.. no 5150 or handlers emma, the world is very cruel and I hope you're not the youtube version of britney spears (controlled) and abused.
COME TO GHENT BELGIUM PLEAAAAAZ
the chunky frames are so fire
17:12 one hit wonder face is a mood
thats nasty
The haul part: history of YouTube
That’s how tampons are in a lot of places 💀 you get them in boxes of 16-32 like that in Australia
Emma Chalemet
Just discovered you and OH MY…..You are not who you were 3+ years ago in vids. Completely different vibe and maturity. Your style now is so fresh and enjoyable. 🤍
Beautiful video! So entertaining
You should totally come to Oregon!!
i love u emma
it’s so weird seeing you in places that i’ve been many times idk i love it
i love how there’s a video from haarlem in the intro lolll *edit* the whole intro is haarlem lolll
Emma walking through the streets of Amsterdam with a Albert Heijn bag was fcking iconic to see. Never in my life i thought i would see that :p
Bruhhhhhh why do you use applicators I literally never saw one 😂 you just stick your finger with it girl
god i love this woman
you are the coolest
8:36 the suitcase?
hey guys, do you know what model of sneakers emma is wearing in this video?
I'm glad ur back Emma missed ur videos
Loving this content Emma ❤
Germany next and go to Hamburg, not Berlin or Munich. Hamburg is the best place to be💗
man I miss Europe
Omg I'm so mad, I live in Amsterdam and my boyfriend literally cycles by in the background of the video but he didn't even see or recognize Emma 😭she also went to the same post office where I always send my packages from! Hope she comes back some day :)
emma i love you but dont you dare to EVER cut that cheese like that again !
Europeans think Americans are such sissies for not wanting to put in a tampon with their finger😂 it’s honestly 10 times easier
did Emma just quote a coho book when she said "is that a f*cking pigeon??" wow I love her
Wait that haul segment was my absolute fav thing!! Felt so genuine in a way
I would have gotten an extra suitcase and just pay for extra language at check in
As someone from the Netherlands it’s so funny how other people experience it😂😂😂
The bees in Europe: Always yeeting into my beverage and getting drunk or drowned in the process
Im sure katherine ann see this🙂
i loved the tampon adventure😌
I LOVE YOU EMMA!
I love those kind of vlogs, I just missed you. I love what you do, it's super relaxing to watch, to see. thank u and I love u 💕
this my cityyyyy
24 uur in Amsterdam is me tekort, dat moet tot in het oneindige duren als het maar kan..😀💋
Thank you Emma for the tampon monologue lol - who knew that would be so entertaining to watch.
5:40 i literally couldn't focus on what she said because the music looks soo much like radiohead's ok computer
Loving these videos!! Her dad's a genius
the editing is so perfect
Saw this video 3 times in this week, loving each second of it, love you Emma <3
a parte que ela passa as calças sincronizando com a música🤏🏻
emma i love your editing
I‘m from Europe and went to the US last month. Forgot my 'european loose' tampons and once I saw the 'US' tampon with the applicator I was like wtf is that ?!
She should’ve titled this “TAMPON SHOPPING WITH EMMA”
Something ab her videos is so calming
canadian chocolate is better then America chocolate! thats why Americans call is candy bars!
your a slice of happiness, thanks for brightening up my daaaaay
when shes happy, im happy
Babygirls on her first day of her period, STILL giving us content. Bless you ❤ Also I really enjoyed how the music went with her skimming thru the jeans & imma need the location of that cheese shop cause OMG.
love her
was that a CoHo reference with the pigeon 🥲
nah cuz i live in belgium so next to netherlands and i wanna see u soooooooo bad i just love u❤
You eat Nijntje ( is that bunny om the chocolade )😢
when she said "is that a f*cking pigeon" I couldn't tell if she was quoting reminders of him by colleen hoover or if she was genuinely shocked to see a pair of socks with a pigeon on them
i'm obsessed with the friends @ 11:57
Waar zijn de Nederlandse comments?😢😂
i fully expected there to be a bit about not being able to pay at ah w/o maestro 😅
$450 in sunglasses
The man painting out of a briefcase is so tight! 🫶
So happy to see her face again 🥲
emma have you been watching the office cus you keep saying REALLY GOOD just like Michael does
12:12 i just know emma was freaking out over the timing
You have to go to Leuven in Belgium
You are too funny. Never been to Amsterdam but would love to go💚👓
I love the vibesssss
That dog at the beginning looked like it was glitching lmao
oh to have her life
I feel like I've grown up with Emma. I've watched her since 2016 and still enjoy her content just as much. It's amazing to see the person she's grown into.
i swear emma is the most relatable youtuber ever
The info felt like a Wes Anderson film with the music and the b roll of roofs
Wait so you have only tampons with applicators in the US?
This makes me want to go back to Europe soooo bad😩😩
te amo mulher
does anyone have a link to these adidas shoes she is wearing?
Em, I totally appreciate the fact that you match the music's beat with your moves, it's soo smooth
This video makes me want to visit Amsterdam so badly
What is the name of the song at the start of the video?
That dog was literally doing the moonwalk…
We should all learn to enjoy the simplicity of life more.
je t'aime emma
I appreciate the timing at 12:13 so much
So are we, the Dutch, just not gonna talk about how she cut her cheese at 12:48?  KOP OP EMMA 😩
omg the beatles shirt is so hot.
The haul montage was so good!
It might come off as random , but thank you , thank you for posting and making my shitty days better by just existing , I'm dealing with a lot of stress from school and figuring our my sexuality lately and all that's to come aka. fearing of being disowned bcs I live in a homopobic country and stuff , I shouldn't overshare haha but thank you , your channel is the nr.1 channel I go to when I need to feel something more than dread and you make me try to push harder to better my sitation in the future. Again, thank you, have a good rest of your day!
Eindelijk in Nederland!! We love you Emma <33
The way you cut that cheese hurt my soul
Help does anyone know which kinda levi’s she has???? :)))
Please visit India ...you will love it. Ilysm🫀🫀
you are such a gorgeous person Emma! Will never get bored of watching you do your thing and doing it so beautifully <33
So in USA you only use tampons with aplicators? No judging but I, as a european, don't even know how to use these because most of us use ''loose'' tampons haha
I think this is the best video I've ever seen ong
Hi Emma can you please give us some forehead kisses sometimes? I miss them
ok now get high
the tampon part screams american hah
emma you should travel to czechia. it is one of the most beautiful countries i have been to. it’s so peaceful and u get a taste of both peaceful countries and full cities
The dancing has me crying lol 😅
12:13 so satisfying 😩✨
I have to knowwww what that sock store was omg
💕💕💕💕💕💕
Imagine if we didn’t eat food bc bugs were in it… we’d starve to death. LOL!!
Next thing we know Emma ends up making movies
I wonder if Emma has done a clean out of her closet… I know a couple years ago she mentioned that she has too much clothes (and man was that closet packed) but she continuously buys more cloths and I just want a clothes tour at this point.. PLS!!!
Emma i luv you but what the heck ?  you can't cut your cheese like that 😂😂
Those tampons are actually really good and I think they are more comfortable/have better application than the ones with the plastic applicator. You can really (shove) them up there. Oh gosh.. that’s graphic. HOWEVER, I highly recommend using a DIVA CUP. That baby saved my periods life, as well as my uterus and my sanity.
Your videos make me happy. Simple truth.
Emmaaaaaa Emma babe if you’re ever in connecticut come to Claires Cornercopia in New Haven I swear to you that you will love it🤍
these videos are amazing
can anyone figure out where her blue sweater is from
I love the relationship you have with your dad. The way he films you is such a perfect representation of his love for you. And the fact that you have the kind of relationship where you are comfortable talking about your period and shopping for tampons with him is *chefs kiss*
Emma is so relatable, captivating, irresistible to watch, no matter what she's doing, I'm hooked! She's the female version of Casey Neistat: https://www.youtube.com/c/Caseyneistatofficial/videos
Omg the haul reminded me so much of an old video
As a European, I could not deal with tampons in the US so seeing you trying to wrap your head around the European ones is very understandable xD
Amsterdam, Netherlands!
Am I the only one that just found out emma HAS TATTOOS?????
07:36 that lady is stealing the bike for sure
Emma, you should visit Vilnius❤️
Say hi to not just bikes
which croissant did u get
lmao i wonder why youd need scissors in Amsterdam
Omg I love Emma so much! She’s so real! And I’ve had an obsession with coffee since I was like 7! ❤❤
“Is that a fucking pigeon??!” -Reminders of him by colleen hoover
Wait what do you mean a tampon applicator?
heyy Emma come to Turkey
Please visit Madrid/Barcelona!
Lmao, the no applicator life in Europe is real. Everyone's just rawdogging it out here. Yeesh!
Why are we exactly the same person lmao
my woman
i said "what the fuck am i watching?" a couple of times throughout this video so chaotic i love it
Lovely 😊 don’t get too stoned
Hey Emma. I think me and my friend saw you at a cozy little restaurant in London around 25th of august. I am just not too sure and didn’t come to say hello. Hope you have had a good time in Europe.
This is my fav video.
I love this
the cinematography and editing is so good
i truly love this human. she gives me joy from my small screen like how???
Nice! I wonder when all of this was shot? Anytime I go to Ams (I live like half an hour away) it's *so* busy. I've hardly ever seen it this empty, except for maybe on Monday mornings or during the pandemic.  Anyway, very cool video, and I love the old man selling his paintings, the cat T-shirt... and the pigeon socks are fire.
I love Emma in Europe content so so much! She seems so much more calm and content and tbh and i think she fits here PERFECTLY! I think she blends into Scandinavian Countries+Netherlands especially, so so easily and they match her vibe so well.
Her videos have become so much more artistic and creative since returning to YouTube. I think she needed a break to find her new style and now it works well for her to upload less frequently but when she does,make high quality videos
Emma go home. You are boing amd talentless when you are abroad
Laughed so hard at the Tampon Dilemma because we obvs grow up with these but then you go on vacation to France/Spain/Italy or the US and you're like MOOOOOOOOOOOM 😭 MOOOOOOM they are gigantic and with plastic SAVE ME
Idk if someone is interested in it..but my best friend was in Cannes and brought me the same necklace like Emmas...I'm so in love with the necklace :)  Thank you L <33
these videos are perfection
I'm always baffled by people shocked at these types of tampons. I only know those. It's your own body and you wash your hands after anyways.
the dog at 02:04 doing a moonwalk. 🕺🏼
You ate Miffy 🐰
But how can one go to Amsterdam and not visit at least one of their museums….?
THE FLIPPING THRU OF THE JEANS SYNCING WITH THE AUDIO😭😭🤌🏼
its so funny to see u go to stores and streets I walk weekly
Just back from Amsterdam and was desperate to find the original photo booths like the one in this video!
The cinematography in this video, combined with the editing, is just INSANE! I cannot believe the shot of that couple...and the flipping of the sweaters paired with the swells of the music? INCREDIBLE!
Amsterdam is so fcking beautiful and accessible like the bikes the trams the streets, amazing
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Why not just buy a duffelbag and check stuff in
Exquisite
emma is so creative guys 😭😭💓 her editing skill is just to next level !!!
i will give america credit on one thing (ONLY 1). they have applicators for tampons. i live in australia and tried them once as they are harder to find. but they are so much more comfortable and hygienic!
I never seen this style of editing but it’s so good!!! Love it! Love Emma! ❤❤❤
This is adorable video.everthing is so perfect. Little things that captured so nice.
anyone know what brand jeans she has on?!
omg the photos were so goood
i had to use loose tampons in germany… now i always travel with regular tampons.
Does anyone else wonder how she can be away from her cats for so long?! I would miss mine way too much so I never go on trips😢
bro i just learned that she's younger than me i can't believe it
I need to know the names of ALL the songs she uses in her Europe travel videos with her dad
i love your videos and specifically capturing the beauty of europe and it’s people. it would be nice however if you spoke more about the issues revolving around fast fashion and consumerism. it’s clear you love shopping but the environmental impact of buying so many clothes, even if there second hand/vintage is not sustainable. would love to hear your thoughts on this since you have such a big following and influence!
loving the dynamic that emma's dad videography makes with emma's editing 10000/10
beautiful video .
what jeans does emma wear?
i love you emma
Beautifully crafted video ! Reminds me of Casey neistat
This so haul is so Emma and I'm loving it 😍💗
this girl was in Amsterdam and I didn't know🥲next time you have to go to Rotterdam and let me know!!😂
24 hours in korea plz😂😂😂😂
Please does anyone knows the brand of her sunglasses?🥺🥺🥺🥺
OMG, that socks store got me! ))))) I am travelling to Amsterdam in December and I'm definitelyyyyyyy going to pick some socks for myself from there. YAY!!😍😇 Thank you Emma for sharing nice moments from AMS trip
so warmful
whatever genre of youtube video this is, i love it
What Emma needs to do in order to have more fun vintage items/clothes. She really needs to not pack any clothing, only underwear and the bathroom essentials. And then literally just buy everything she wants when traveling…
i went to amsterdam 4 months ago and loved it. omg she went to the same thrift shop as me i am screaming❤️🥺
Emma, can you be any cuter! the pigeon socks, omg. And how can a city be so beautiful and bike friendly. love from a 54 year old mom fan!
Loose tampons is that like a loose cigarette 😂
it was the haul for me❤
i love these videos, they give me peace
every 24h video makes me wanna travel around the world drinking coffee and being just me. it feels so peaceful and easygoing.
coffeeshop story seemed personal
Las tomas>>>
levis queen
the perfect timings with the music are blowing me out, love u emm!! 💝
I’m obsessed 🥹
girl- ditch the plastic and use ya finga!!!!!!!
okie dokie my long lost wife,, you're somewhere on the planet somewhere, maybe on the other side? does anybody know who I'm talking to? Emma might read and hear my words,, but only in the thoughts in her head!
Обожаю Амстердам, очень приятные впечатления
the haul was hilarious
What jeans is she wearing?
Can this be a tv show
Imagine being able to buy true JEAN PAUL GAULTIER in Amsterdam... shop your heart out Emma!
IM MELTING AT THE OLDER GENTLEMEN PAINTING AND SELLING HIS WORK AND THE LIL SMILE ❤
go to turkey please
the best vibes
The dog losing his shit in the background had me rolling 😂
that was the best haul i’ve seen the music fit so perfectly 😭
There is some existential sadness mixed with a sparkle of magic and love for life in Emma's eyes and I absolutely love it!
GOD I absolutely love watching all of your videos. Everything about them is just so CHEFS KISS. From the way the scenes change, to the music which feels like it matches all the moods. Gives my brain serotonin.
To me in Australia, loose tampons are ones sold individually and probs only in machines in public bathrooms.... lol
This was actually the best video I've ever watched in my entire life. Thank you Emma and Emma's dad for creating such a beautiful video.
what’s the name of the cheese shop and the sock shop? I’m going to Amsterdam in a couple of weeks and I gotta add these to my list
Emma chamberlain is my therapy.
you should seriously make films
Emma doesn’t even know that she quoted colleen Hoover’s reminders of him
You're like a little blonde Bourdain. Love it. Your Dad is also crushing your videography. Go Dad!
emma where did you learn to cut cheese?????
i’m a 21 year old guy and watching emma chamberlain vids is my secret pleasure lol
indie band vibes
those tampons were cheap!
This is so weird to see as someone from The Netherlands 😂😂
her life is a movie, love that
tampons without applicators are so much sexier. discreet - slip it into your bra when youre out // if you're at your link's house // and change it easy peasy . less waste - good for the environment!! easy to store in your bathroom - tampons arent 4ft long without the applicator. when i came to the us and they only had applicators i was shocked!!  i am very passionate about this issue
Fav part is the outfit montage
Your dad has such a cool daughter
Эма.  нот ваууууу
I cannot begin to describe how  much I love this style of your content Emma. its so personal and comforting, and I love that you and your dad get to create these works of art together
bug: goes in soup emma: I CANT EAT MY SOUP NOW 1 sec later: continues eating
I was just there and I wish I didn’t have to leave
Emma get a large suitcase 😭
Omg youuuu 😐 i didnt even read who posted this :^ famous chick
is she vegetarian
I LOVE how she edits her videos specially with the song choices. It feels so jazzy and fun. Idk why but the part of the haul gave me charles chaplin vibes
I love her dad’s videography style, it’s so peaceful yet he throws in just enough chaotic energy to match emma’s
Can we appreciate the romantic mooment that was captured at 11:53 like AHHHH
oh to be skinny and light-skinned and rich
You can’t buy tampons with applicators in most countries in Europe because we want to avoid plastic trash 😅
The intro to this and your bit about the coffeeshop felt like an episode of  ‘Anthony Bourdain’s The Layover’, love love love it
Did we just observe the very start of a relatioship at 11:52 ?
Bad short term memory regarding scissors. Coffeeshop much?
had the opposite tampon problem when I was in nyc, lol
Thanks!
The uncles speaking twi at 9:55 🤭 where are the Ghanaian Emma watchersss
This is terrible. Thats my supermarket. Thats my neighbourhood. I was sick in bed for two days. Loved to meet her
I enjoyed watch to you . you always gives us energy. I love you so much. your audience from turkey
The Beatles shirt was 🤌🏻✨ GREAT
Instead of shipping stuff back why not get another carryon?
that beatles shirt is just AMAZING
at bars when drinking wine or beer you can order cheese plates and the cheese so old it got salt crystals is the best
I love you emma, you’re like a sunshine
okay when she was going through the jeans at the thrift and it lined up with the music... im geeking
this is art
i love this content way more, it’s so calming and relaxing to watch
HOW are most of the places so empty and quiet and PEACEFUL
the two people at 11:52 are so cute
im literally im amsterdam.. UR TELLING ME I COULDVE SEEN EMMA??!!
Omg this means I could've bumped into you
5 Of The World's Funniest One Liners!  1. God made mankind. Sin made him evil. 2. Borrow money from a pessimist — they don’t expect it back. 3. For every action there is an equal and opposite criticism. 4. No one is listening until you make a mistake. 5. Eschew obfuscation.   Hello! Perhaps the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
I swear life in Europe is a movie
The old man at 8:50 melted my heart ❤️❤️😭😭
Lmao, i work at McDonald's, I know exactly what smell your talking bout. Love ya girl!  Also you know that unique "It" girl factor that Brittany Murphy and Marilyn Monroe have, Emma's got it too!

To me as a dutch person, this is just so fun to watch
This is just such a realistic view on Amsterdam and The Netherlands, hope you enjoyed our capital Emma! Come back anytime soon, I think you would fit so well in the city of Utrecht in The Netherlands <3

How can shovels afford to just take a trip to Amsterdam for 24 hours ?
ugh I love this city
She looks so happy <3
Emma’s vlogs are so inspiring. Living like poetry. I love her style so much
It still amazes me that Americans are so shocked by a tampon without an applicator and the thought of using  just your finger shocks them 😂
Haven’t been feeling so well and just watching your videos helps . ❤
when 24 hours in venice????'''''
emma! your vlogs are so cosy!! when you watch them, you start to feel like you are at home with a woollen blanket and a cup of green tea. i love them so much, and of course i appreciate your father’s work, his shooting makes the vlog feel like when you are watching your parents’ diaries at their teenage ages!! keep going like this, we love it so so much!!!
Where is that blue sweater from????
i just… why is this so entertaining?
im from the Netherlands and I've seen soo much tiktoks of you walking there😭
It's the person making the content that makes it so good to watch, her vibes and character
Been watching you since 2016 so happy you still make us laugh and be so creative with YouTube again thank you Emma and her dad obviously
THE BEATLES SHIRT ONG NO WAY
🙌
emma admitting she wears a paul mccartney shirt to bed and then buying a sgt pepper one thrifting... i see you i hear you i feel you i love you
When Emma said is that a fucking pigeon it reminded me of Reminders of Him
so she’s just been in europe for the last couple months or what? lol is she moving there? what is this for?
I’d love to go more than anything (netherlands)
Broken shift key?
travel without clothes in your suit case... make it a thing
THE TRY ON HAUL>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
the way that the music aligned with her looking at the jeans...*chef's kiss*
It's so funny how clueless americans are haha
I think loose means sold in bulk .
Her videos feel like a movie that doesn’t really have a plot but i love it so so much
this is soo good, love you Emma you make my day happier <3333
You know your that Dutchie when you walk around with a big Albert Heijn bag
love the period/ tampon excursion 10/10   if you use tampons, you should try out a diva cup! or other brands because its sooooo easy to carry around and its reduces waste! not gonna lie tho, it does take some time to get use too but v worth it in the end. I also use thinx underwear as well just so i have full coverage bc fo me a cup isn't enough on those heavy days.
If I were a teen millionaire literally all I would do is travel. Why limit yourself to 24 hours 😅
YOU FINALLY POSTED SMTH IN THE NETHERLANDS
the haul was my favorite thing ever
That tall handsome dude and the girl in the frilly pink dress talking was such a cute moment captured on camera 🥰 it was like they were actors.
She is soo damn fine
you should go to Egypt. Beautiful place, seriously
from beginning till at last action of you make me hehehe and smile, thank's beauty. how about judge ? ( Billie e )  :) :P ;) :))
Stick that tampone up yours smelly hole
I think the loose tampon thing is a european thing its very normal in germany too
Love you Emma❤
Okay but is nobody gonna talk about “is that a f*cking pigeon?” I mean reminders of him by the Colleen Hoover
Wait but no I’m from the UK me and my mates use no applicator loose ones why would you need to waste plastic when you gots hands 😭😭😭
can someone please find all the music used in the video ?
idc what anyone says she dont hit the same no more
I live in the Netherlands I didn't know you where here 😭
Go back and spark a joint in a coffee shop, then visit one of those bakeries and order the most extravagant pastry with chocolate drizzle. I implore you to do so!
this vlog is delicious.
12:11 Did that just happen to be in sync with the rhythm of the music or delibarately arranged?
Hahah i had the same issue with tampons in Netherlands. I went back in the store to buy pads XD
how could you choose the pair of socks, i would've bought the whole store
I LOVE EUROPEAN TAMPONS, LESS PLASTIC YEAH BABYYYY
emma is amazing. LOVE YOUUU.
the best
i smiled the whole thing
I love everything 🥰🥰 thanks for make my day better with this video 🤩 i love the Haul hahaha
Hoping you never returne
✂   ✂    ✂    ✂
emma + her dad's = amazing content 😆😆
Pls come to Germany
I feel like im watching the travel channel and facetiming my friend at the same time
11:52 was such a movie worthy shot in a romantic film
I love you and you father
fancy dance skills ;)
The pigeon socks were iconic
we have to do a haul aggressive pigeon sock exposure
Wonderful. 🧿♥️💎❤
I love this woman.
These videos remind me of the OG days of Emma and her dad meeting for coffee in San Francisco. I feel found again.
The cinematography in this video is amazing!
the song they put in the beginning it’s actually what they put in every classic european movie 🫣
-_____-
you just burped my whole persionality but its not okay
11:53 that exchange was sus xD
I had no idea who was filming her, but my intuition was telling me it was her brother. does she even have a brother? at the end I saw it was filmed by michael chamberlain. edit: ah, it was her dad! he must be a pretty cool dad.
you have to come to Japan!! it would be so much fun for you in terms of completely different culture, buildings, foods everything here!!!!!!!
THIS VLOG IS SO FUCKIN GOOOOOOOOD
yup we don't have tampon applicators here. you'll just have to get your hands dirty (literally)
i love how at -5:30 swiping the jeans match the sound
We have no applicator tampons in the states too lol. OB is a pretty big brand that sells them
Tip if you wanna make carry on traveling easier :  There’s these vacuum storage bags which you can put a bunch of clothes in and then it gets all the air out and presses it together. I’ve been using them for the first time this summer and fit two times the amount of clothes in my carry on than I normally would (the clothes weren’t even wrinkly afterwards ! )
I still think of her speech at the streamys it was so emotional 😢
Always relaxing Emma
you've met a friend of me there lol he made a picture of you!!!!!
Hahahha im from germany and we only have those types of tampons 😂 I don’t know any other types with applicators what so ever ahaha
I have not been to Amsterdam.But my late mum and my dad went there for there wedding anniversary and they liked it there.
If you ever come to Finland I can be your guide I know all the best hidden places in Helsinki.
2:05 the dog just start moonwalking
Full godeto my Queen!!!!!111🤑🤑🤑
Love the water city. Thanks Emma for sharing the experience!
First time watching your channel and already love it!!  Do anyone know the name of store of socks please!!! :)
Emma, those scissors are too big to put in a carry on. It can’t go over 6cm (dear Americans, please feel free to say how much that is in inches) and that’s way over, I’m pretty sure
waiting her to come istanbul
Tell me why I thought when she mentioned crime scene she was talking about the morning after wine shits
LOS TAMPONES EN ARGENTINA SON ASI!!!!!! te lo metes, es lo mismo. igualmente aca en mi pais ya militamos la copa bastante y la tenemos bien socializada. recomiendo siempre tenes una
Bee lands in soup after first bite, "I can't even eat this now", proceeds to eat soup. Rofl.
would watch this for hours 🥺
that huge cheese with coffee and then the soup looked sooooooooo tasty 😋🤤 why did you have to film it? just to make us hungry?!!!
Does she not go to any historical sites when she travels? Just shops wherever she goes
Love Emma. She's great, but her style is awful. Some of those outfits ☠️
I need to know if she smoked a joint😂
Travel❤😮amazing! Emma so cute lavyu! *i miss the forehead kisses😂😘💜🤩
my inner colleen hoover fan came out at 14:32 when she said 'is that a f***** pigeon'
nice teamwork with your dad :)
*Amsterdam and *Netherlands

Who films you while travelling?
These applicators for tampons are just a massiv plastic waste
someone give this girl a travel show already, but only if it stays this low-key
Emma 🤍🤍
There are many other cool city's in holland its not all about the weed
Where are your sunglasses from?
Please go to a non-white country next video.  I would love to see you in a different element
Such a beautiful, fun and calming video.  Love her dad's cinematography skills.  He captured the City so beautifully.  Emma is not just making great content -- she has now set the bar so high and is making small films instead of just video content.  She has the most relatable personality and her content is always a joy to view.
nah cuz the cinematography and editing where ON POINT, did ya'll go to school for this? Cuz it looks like professional work, literally tv show quality.
We need more dance content. 🤌
💯💯
“Is that a fucking pigeon”
As a French : OMG How did you cut that poor cheeeeese
where are my dutchies watching this at
11:53 this part looks like it came from a movie
🔥🤣
What's the name of the socks shop?
I feel like im watching smth from bbc
Emma’s parents must of created such a comfortable environment for her as a kid to not only be so open on her channel but also with her dad especially about tampons lol kudos to them
is she not vegan anymore?
is she not vegan anymore?
This was mostly Haarlem at the beginning
Welcome to europe! Those tampons are very common here😅
11:52 to 12:00 was magical wow
"is that a fucking pegion" you've read Reminders of Him?😍🤍🫣
I loved this vlog !! Altough Sad that you skipped Belgium on your europe tour! Anyways have a lot fun happy Emma xxx
Does anyone know where her sunglasses are from? 🙌🥺
Truly a masterpiece emma
OMG u had nijntje chocolate
Omg why didnt i know this!!!!
When Americans don’t know the difference between Tampax and tampons
So cool 😎🆒
The dog barking in the back and walking backwards🤠 it looked so surreal

Yeah, she stopped at the coffeeshop.  Several times.
I missed her Tryon haul dance so freaking much lmao
can someone from Amsterdam please tell me the stores she went to 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
From the European side: I always wondered why tampons are that long in the US until I figured out that u guys usually have an applicator.
Best bday present thank u darling ❤
Hello. Do you want to visit Russia?
it’s so much fun to see the two cities i lived in in one of emma’s videos and i really love recognizing everything
i live in amsterdam and just moved to Croatia, the AH she went in is the one I go to every morning for 1€ coffee… imagine going in and seeing Emma 🥹🥹🥹
Emma is so beautiful and her videos always make me smile
I kid you not when i say i’d leave this whole wide world just to be in her company.
Emaaaaaa get a menstrual cup I stg it will change your life

Negara yang pernah menjajah indonesia, simak di tempat saya yuk, memori zaman dulu
The ADHD moment got me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
OMG FINALLY THE NETHERLANDS
The first shots are Haarlem not Amsterdam.
❤❤❤
When you showed the tampon I was like what’s wrong with it? Do you find it too big, did you expect them to give more? 😂😂
the haul made me so happy - I love her little dances
Crossaints, her tampon problem and her full luggage… Not much Amsterdam was going on
They are so cute 11:55
Omg!! When I moved from the netherlands to spain I saw EVERYWHERE tampons with this plastic extra stuff (applicator). And I still don't know how to use tampons with an applicator lmao. Loose tampons for the win I guess haha.
12:12 <3
I love how everytime she’s done with what she’s saying : 🚶🏼‍♀️💨
i love that michael chamberlain is still wearing his og outfit- jeans and a flannel
This is the only type of content I’ll ever need.
emma in the albert heijn is iconic
Does anyone know the brand of sunglasses she’s wearing?
i loved it
dog was moonwalking 2:03
Omg where is the photobooth??????? So fun to see u in my country 🖤🖤🖤

This video was so calming and everything about it was perfect. Thank you. Sending love.💗
12:14 i lovveee that the song and the way you pulled the pants are so combined its so güüüdd :)
Hope the street artist got compensated for his lovely work!
we all need a Michael in our life. The person who films your life while grasping the mood, emotion, feelings with it.
love u emma, so sad I couldnt see you while you were here due to a resit of a test :*) , glad you enjoyed it
seeing emma walk in the 'appie' is confusing lmao
wholesome

Ohhh yeah btw..Completely 100% related, I stayed in my car for 24 hours, I bet you my whole garden carrot you won't click - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wubJH1aVbwc
LOVEEEEE
You just lift my darn soul 🥹 not me watching & seeing you find the pigeon socks and saying aloud “OMG she loves pigeons! She needs them!” With literally nobody but my dog around. Happy you’re posting on YT again, but in a way that feels good for you ❤
amazing! Emma you're editing skills are something else. such a fun and comforting video to watch! hope you're having a great time :)
You should visit moers in Germany
why didn’t she just buy another suitcase?
Who is responsible for all the smoke in the air in California??
That was exactly what I needed right now, thank you so much!! I loved this video a lot. And the fact that you travel with your dad and he shot this amazing vid, it’s mindblowing for me!   Love you! Emma, you belong in Europe!
Loved this so much. Thank you for sharing your trips Emma. I especially loved the fashion show with the great dancing.😊… question…and you may have mentioned it in one of your videos and I missed it, but, do you take any sweetener or cream in your coffee? Just wondering. Thanks again. And keep ‘‘em coming.
So good. So soo good. And the love for pigeons really warms my soul 🫶
15:35 I MISSED THIS EMMA !!!
Highlights: - the dog 11:40 - relatable shopping content: buys chocolate 9:17  - learn about feminine hygiene 1:40 - flipping through clothes matched the music 12:12 - Emma's bum reflection in the red pants 11:26 - wholesome father-daughter relationship 17:32 - saying "gooouud" 1:38, 11:22 - dad saves the bee, and Emma's soup 13:34 - emma embarrassing herself but having fun 16:00 - also, why was this so satisfying?? 5:06
This is the BEST piece of YouTube art I’ve EVER seen
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.      !
of course the cinematography and editing are epic. but can we just appreciate the talk about tampons in front of her dad? i mean i could never lol. it's awesome actually
You could always buy a larger suitcase?
MUNICH GIRL COME TO MUNICH
emma's vlogs just feel different, i feel like i'm in a tv show with the pauses of people walking, running, sitting and then going back to her it makes me feel like a tv show but a whole another dimension, and it just feels and looks different every time. it's so magical to see her live her best life in such a different way that nobody else does. i enjoyed absolutely every second, big fan over here. <3
Lmao her outfit bit is her reminding us that in the end she’s still a little white girl
the fact that when Emma said "we have to do a haul" she didn't just talk and show like other you tubers but made it so fun just proves how amazing she is
Best birthday gift . Can’t wait to see your upcoming videos 🥹💌
the music choices are superb
love u, emma xx
this is therapeutic xoxo
That haul was a cinematic experience
emma always find a day to make my day :))
my fave city & your dad is a legit cinematographer
The old man looks so happy while painting and his smile when a family bought his painting was priceless! I hope to visit amsterdam soon and buy a painting from that man!
The jeans on the clothing rack matching perfectly in time with the music.
Damn
The editing and videography 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
anne's frank house?
the sorority girl accent SENT me
Love, as always
i can see so much more of ur personality in this vid, its really cool to see! keep being you :)
When there was a smiley face in Emma's coffee at 12:37 :)
I always look forward to watching your vlogs and the pigeon is literally your spirit animal Emma hahahaha
I love seeing the day to day of people living their lives and the expressions they carry 🥰
Thank you :)
I’ve been waiting for this vlog to drop
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.             /,,,,,,,,,,,,......................
14:23 The seriousness of you saying the phrase "No Coffee, No Workee" with the pretty music in the background made me laugh histerically
Exact same thing happened with me in paris this July with the tampons I was horrified and no stores had. Why do u we live the same life
Emma just buy a extra big luggage !! ❤
Emma’s outer dialogue sounds exactly like my inner dialogue
11:52 omg did we just witness somebody shoot their shot that was so cute
Wonderful city ❤️

Emma’s face when the dog was barking 🤣🤣🤣
I love you and all your positive comments 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️
Thank you Michael and thank you Emma!
I love you Emma
You already know ur day’s gonna be great when Emma uploads
Emma’s videos are so visually striking that I have to stop everything to watch it
time slows down when i watch emma’s vlog. her videos calm me down more than meditation.
She always picks the perfect background music
Sooo many ppl are trying to copy this video style now
She really gets off acting like she's from our world, Haaagh !! @Fashionweek
Emma’s trying to convince us that she needs to ship stuff home cause she feels guilty about buying more clothes 😂 emma we don’t judge you
Whoa this Bae acts like she's not from our world, verly likely she's an alien
@Miley
Ur dad is amazing!
the song and the clip matching at 12:12 is such a small detail and yet it gives me so much joy
What’s a loose tampon😂 idk either !!!???
Millions and millions of American girls shud go to Amsterdam they need the culture so Baaad !!!
the haul clip gave me nacho libre vibes and i love it
i love love love amsterdam and it was so much fun to watch emma experience it. can't wait to try some of the places she did next time I'm there :)
She makes me want to drink water and read a book
13:45 omg god forbidddd lmao
eu te amo
I'M ENJOYING THIS SERIES!
BEWARE OF COFFEE SHOPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The work in every shot of the video is amazing, great cinematography; almost like a live painting. 🐱💛
Watching from Philippines
Emma you have to get a menstrual cup!
the fact you just get to travel the world with ur dad and be so comfortable and open with him is a dream, you're so lucky
"what's a LOOSE tampon?" lmaooo
crying at the sweetness of her dad filming & her editing. what a beautiful relationship
I just found my new comfort video
loved this. such a beautiful city. this video took me back to the weeks i spent there this past summer, so special. seeing emma go to all the same places i did like albert heijn, episode, fashain, etc. it made me feel like i was reliving all these experiences 💟
one hit wonder if i was gonna do it again i knew it wouldn't be this good
one hit wonder if i was gonna do it again i knew it wouldn't be this good
This thumbnail is giving me Martha Stewart vibes in the best way possible. Love her and love you! 🤍
But do you ever just talk to a stranger?
broooo I love ur relationship with ur dad. So wholesome!!!
12:13 the way the music syncs with emma sorting through the jeans🤌
i want a devon and emma youtube collab so bad🫶🏼
this is honestly all i need from her.
Are there any dutch people here watching her in our city where im born and raised? Or am i the only one? Laat je horen als je me begrijpt
Is it your dad still filming you about your menstruation cycle?
At 11:45 did we just witness a drug deal? LOL
I love this, glad ur back Emma <33
chef's kiss
I wanna know if Emma smokes weed or not, lol
This video needs an entire series emma
all the little random moments captured of people o n the street are like movie scenes, cinematography 1000/10
Emma dad is almost different from emma but still finds a way to work with her
i love this bye
This video feels so comforting to watch. It reminds me that not everything needs to be so busy and constantly doing something "fun". Like you can just chill and enjoy your coffee or cheese and go thifting and it's still a great day. I kind of feel weird watching traveling videos where they are always on the go to do something big. Enjoying the little things.
I was so blown away by how bad the candy and chocolate is in America. This is not a myth or a stereotype, that’s so legit. I kept buying things and throwing them out. 🙅🏼‍♀️
Emma’s vlogs are like a peaceful fun temporary break from the chaos of life
you can't even call these vlogs this is videography
l love emma
Rip Emma’s granola
pure genius i love you
where did you go for the Photo Booth going to Amsterdam soon and want those types of pictures.
americans finding out abt regular tampons is so entertaining
Just buy a new suitcase and add stuff to the new suitcase ?
fantastic city to live or visit. but you need money to enjoy. Dutch are great people. in many ways better than a warm climate wasteland.
落ち着くわ、、、
12:13 this was literally PERFECT
whats the name of her sunglasses? they’re so cool
Omg 14:30 it’s the quote from remainders of him😮
You are the only youtuber i watch on full screen
Emma, I mean this in the best way possible: you look like a mom.
11:55 those 2 r def in love
If you come to Turkey , your luggage gonna be x3 more
Did Emma lose millions of subscribers? I thought she had 13 mil? Maybe I’m wrong
I wonder if she knows she has ADHD! lol I have it too we’re so similar in some ways. 😂
I LOVE YOU!
don't come to Australia as we only have loose tampons hahahah
This brought me so much joy it’s crazy
no need for an applicator, you just wash your hands before and after and use your finger - way less waste, its normal in europe i was shocked going to the dominican republic and finding the applicator ones i had to ask a lady at a restaurant how to use it hahaha
Emma❤ i hope you come to Germany next ! 😊
Thank you, Emma and Michael (Mike?) !
🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽🫶🏽
ME JUST BEING LIGIT STONED RN
ooh u were only 2 hours away from my place 😪 ❤️
The relationship you have with your dad is INCREDDDIBLE! The thing I love most about this is your dad recording you talking about a tampon without an applicator LOL. dad and daughter goals
what a gem! I love watching you evolve and still remain a foolish delight.
This is the pinnacle of vlogs :)
The captions, flawlessly done, so satisfying🔆I could follow and focus on the whole video during a panic attack /& w adhd :)
these videos are nothing but comfort
This is some tv series kinda videographer and editing and audio. Well done!
Are we not gonna talk about the fact that how much we missed her?
I had my VERY first period on the plane going to Europe…so I had to use those babies and it a real treat😂
Anyone knows what kind of pants she is wearing? They‘re so cute!
I’ve always dreamed of being an influencer like Emma since I was a small child, I would always tell my mom (who passed away) that I was going to become big online and make money like that to take care of us… I guess this video just reminded me and I’m taking my step in that direction
emma ily
I love your shades. Where can i get them please?
I live in that neighborhood and thought I saw Emma walking around the other day but figured probably not, since she lives in the US... but turns out she might have been it!
is this you? 🤣 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGq99DZ416g
this was perfect. love u emma <3
this looks like a movie
ok if the next video is "24 hours in Switzerland" I can't help but feel like this is a series of "how to visit all of europe without having to see germany" lmao.  Lovely vid though. Really enjoying the vlogs
😊
emma i have a cheese phobia
Everything I needed 🤎
WHO LEFT MY GRANOLA OPEN
Every time I watch your videos, I envy you and your life. you know we are living in Iran, no, we are dying in Iran. #مهسا_امینی
I wish America was that peaceful 💕
Красивая девушка
I like how the guy who is filming doesn't get to have one bite lol
My husband and I went to Amsterdam in  2018 and it was the my fav place I have been yet.
They try on haul was everything I needed!! Bring back that dope energy sometimes, we all know you got it 😅😊
think this is my favourite video you have ever done so good
dude why don't you just buy another suitcase
THE PHOTOBOOTH PICTURES ARE SO GORGEOUS WHAT
I’m convinced Emma’s strong sense of self is completely related to the epic relationship she has with her Dad. Fathers are important.
Why is the first few frames of the '24 hours in Amsterdam' literally not even in Amsterdam 🤣 Great shots of Haarlem though 👏
I think that through those videos we can kinda feel the vibe of Emma's relationship with her dad and how he accepts and supports her.
Who makes those blue jeans
Welcome To My City @emma chamberlain. Very Nice!!! Living in Amsterdam has its drawbacks, but to some people, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. Anyway nice to see you coming to Amsterdam♥
I live like half an hour away from amsterdam, and I’m there for school every day, it makes me forget about how nice of a city Amsterdam actually is. Tho Emma’s edditing and the ways she’s filming is really showing me the beautiful parts of the city again. I realised I should walk around there more often cause it’s actually really nice. Thanks Emma!!
how is she still pretty on her period wtf
Haul my fav moment from the video 🔥🔥👍🫶🏼
u need to eat dutch pancakes and the caramel waffer things
Wheen are you going to admit you are a  lesbian
13:52 Good you ate the food cuz I thought u were not gonna eat it 😅 Bees are actually good for your health 😳
these vlogs are just a rich girl having nothing to do expect consume
emma's vlogs are so cute!!!!
you re my favorite person in this whole world I will love u forever
nijntje
scissors to remove tag from your new clothes lol
These travel videos have been so wonderful❤ Hope she’s really being happy and taking all the time to do what she wants and needs to be the best for herself❤
Something about your videos is zo peaceful
In Europe we don’t use applicators for our tampons and it works perfectly fine :) I think it’s also a lot more environmentally friendly!
I love your vlogs emma its like therapy ! but why do you ship those clothes just give them away in europe
Çiğ köfte yerken izledim emmacığım
It's somehow funny to me that Emma is so confused about the tampon with no applicator. Normal thing in Germany as well and saves a bit of plastic waste. But did they just send her only ONE tampon? :D
The majority of tampons you can find in countries other than the US are "loose". They are cheaper without an applicator and also no unnecessary singe-use plastic. It just makes more sense.
where is that Photo Booth???
This video style is so nice to watch. Feels like watching a friend do loads of food tastings while travelling and they're just bringing you along.
emma is by far my comfort person  <3
Whoever's reading this, i pray that whatever you're going through gets better ❤️❤️and whatever you're struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine. Keep Smiling
I feel so peaceful watching Emma’s videos. They make me happy ☺️
we are not worthy
getting flashbacks when i was looking for allergy medicine in europe 24/7 but u cant get it unless u go to the dr there 💀
thank you for the ads at the very end of the video. I watched too 💐
why didn't u let me know? not cool emma
11:52 BRUH
As a Dutchy I can confirm that Emma knows where to shop! 👍 And shipping off clothes in an Albert Heijn shopping bag is the way to go! 😂
She's turning into one of those nostalgic PBS travel shows and I'm HERE FOR IT 💗
Emma dancing it's all in this life<3
Who is the cameraman?
Not the pigeon socks 😂
i love how emma is just doing stuff. i love it so much
THE FUCKING DOG-
Emma going to appies is something I did not know I needed
Emma I'm not sure if you are aware of the j.w.anderson pigeon clutch. I feel like you need it!!!
8:50 omg i can’t this man is sssoooo cute 😭😭😭 wanna buy all of his paintings 🥹
Your Dad is so cute 😩❤️ he looks like he belongs in a sophisticated environment haha.
can you explain why you didn't just buy another suitcase...?
"👀.. whats a loose tampon?"
howshe can be that open with her father
Luv her
This is europe - where tampons are looser than the marijuana laws
Anyone have the details on these glorious yellow tinted shades? Girl god daammnnn I’m in love !!!!
Does anyone know where her blue cashmere sweater is from :)
what song is playing at the end, I'm obsessed with it
She went to Albert Heijn 🥰🥰 don’t know how to explain this but this makes me so happy 🥲🥲
Hi Dad!!!!
okay but 14:24 had me dying 🤣
i love watching you just live your life
I am from the Netherlands and loved the video! Thanks for coming to this country. BTW I have never used a tampon with applicator lol.
THE DOG AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
cried
You have to go to switzerland, there you get the best chocolat and cheese. ❤
she talks about tampons with her dad?
I FUCKING LOVE U SM
i love the beauty in all the vlogs i’ve always wanted to visit all of these countries and these vlogs tide me over until i’m able to go🤭
i need to see the clips where your dad laughs or does commentary after he films something for you.
https://youtu.be/ZSUzODWPIdE?t=714   hope they see this, it's such a Pinterest moment🤭 and Emma and her dad are amazing as always
I am in love with you and your Videos ❤
MMM MMM MMM this was too good😋🍸
I love and live for Emma’s vlogs something about them make me feel so hopeful lol like seeing what she does at her age is amazing, my comfort YouTuber 🫶
hahaha the post office dude i see every week i gasped when i saw him, love him
never disappoints < 3
You make everyday life seem so beautiful and peaceful
12:46 as a Dutchie it hurts to see you cut the cheese like that 😂
Are these video filmed but ALSO edited by her father. He gives this vibe. But Emma could definetly too
Why is this on trending? Such a random video, going to a pointless day, no direction, no value, no.
Emma you need to visit Berlin!
It hurt how she cut the cheese
Is that a fucking pigeon? if you know you know <3
the way u match the music with the looking pants situation, was just perfect. i really need to know the thrift shop u went in. PD: i'm in love with u emma
The haul should have included the tampons
2:06 the guy just pulling the dog away 😂
Anyone else noticed the dogs legs @ 2:03 ? LOL
I love the way Emma was crouching to eat the cheese. Like go you little mouse queen. I am obsessed 😂❤️
I loved this vlog so so much, thank you Emma for always putting so much effort in your videos! <3 You made my day
These are actual short films and I  LOVE them!
Omg bestie ….how much did you pay to ship your stuff????? o___O
First shots of the video are not amsterdam :/
omg the "is that a fucking pigeon?" CoHo quote!
What is the camera used?
Omg u went to the Netherlands ✨🤩
i love the goofy ass background music 😂😂❤
heated up a raisin scone and made some tea with oat milk just for watching this. It’s a masterpiece
Love how relatable Emma remains even though she’s an icon traveling across the globe. ❤❤❤
as a Dutch person I always take extra tampons to the use because they only have the weird one with an applicator....🙂
The tampon part made me laugh so hard, because as a European, the applicator one was the same shock for me haha
Idk why but it makes me happy knowing Emma will have an Albert Heijn shopping bag laying in her home in the U.S.
2:03 the dog moonwalked
Omg yesss I’ve always wanted to visit the Netherlands 🇳🇱 and the fact you did a vlog there I’m thoroughly enjoying this !❤
I had the SAME thing happen when I was in Paris and had a crime scene happen. The front desk lady gave me the smallest pad I've ever seen for my heavy flow and the next day I scrambled to find pads 😂
Loved this, so peaceful! Thank you for bringing us along this beautiful trip <3
im gonna write a book about that couple 11:58
amazing video once again. although, come to Rotterdam next time! its architecturally so diverse and only 25 min w train ! you'd enjoy it :)
i can watch this forever
Enjoyed this video seeing you walking in amsterdam, the netherlands my home <3
WHATS THE NAME OF THE SOCK SHOP!!!
love the videos Emma, really fun to watch. Thank you!
<33333333333
The amount of joy I feel because of her feels almost illigal
Why that old painter made me so happy <3 Love the videos so so much Emma
Love u love Amsterdam
emma’s vlogs always puts me at peace
try on haul was EVERYTHING I MEAN
EMMMMAAAAA

Emma come to Tilburg😂
I really love how this vlog was constructed!! feels so safe and calm lol
Not the DADS 🥴
it’s a strange feeling living in ams and knowing a lot of places she’s going and having been there 🫶🏼
Loving this style of content. Welcome to the netherlands. More of you and jesse pls
You did not just cut your cheese like that Emma?
She never looses her sparkle. I love it so much
hiii emma, welcome to the netherlandss:)  I loved this video so much, you are just so authentic and you truly inspired me to start making my own videos. I just started, but wanted to thank you for giving me the courage to start and I send you all my love!! <3
Girlies pleease can we try not using tampons anymore. I know cups are streessfuull at the beginning, but just way less waist and better for us 💜💜💜
These are becoming total artpieces !
Love the Colleen Hoover Reminders of Him reference
I got confused. Why are we talking about tampons in a travel video? 😅 I'm just kidding. It was funny. 😂🙃
15:35 my favorite part of the video
what where the scissors for i need to know
Ahh you ate ‘nijntje’. The Dutch icon on your chocolate 🥹
Omggg your in my city gurllll
Emma discovering europe doesn‘t use applicators is the best hahah
"well now i cant eat it" takes giant slurp
EMMA..... your editing is aaaaamazing!!!! I love it and love seeing you enjoi it again too
these dad-daughter duo videos have been ELITE
okay but the haul was everything
15:33 😭
GO to antwerp please Belgium
I love this so so much
Do not put clothing u did not buy around anywere that has makeup .................................................... That is just fucking rude
#lifestyle
13:33 when the cheese is so good it's mistaken for honey
BISHHSH why did you go right after I left 💀
i thought tampons packaged like that was normal??
I wonder if we were there at the same time lol
deve ser legal viver
i fucking love seeing emma all tatted up!!! so sick
NO WAY YOU CAME TO AMSTERDAM I HAD NO CLUE 😭
no way I was born there and moved to London when I was 5!!
I love this & you sm. So happy to see you happy (:
You should come visit switzerland
15:38 …..this is the best thing I’ve ever seen
the old man painting single-handedly made me want to sob
Emma I’m obsessed with you
Omg i got a moee sound at the end… then i was like ‘hu’, no way there are cows in the middle of Amsterdam. Like want a damn minute! And realised it was a commerical. So far my roots.. as a dutchie. Go me hahaha 🐄✌🏼
my favorite girl! we love you Emma.
12:12 that beat is on point lmao
emma will you collaborate with wildflower case again for iPhone 14 series ❤
on trips i used buy a carry on to take home just for souvenirs
Coming from the uk and almost all my holidays all my life being in Europe I can definitely agree American chocolate is so so bad 😂
emmmmaaa you need to go to japannnnnnn
How you paid at albert heijn self checkout??? because i couldn't use my card and had to go to the register to use cash 😭🥲
I guess I don’t have understand how ladies don’t track their cycle and don’t know When it will come, that way you know to bring your own stuff especially when you’re gonna be out of the country and can’t find what you need 😳
The way the music fits the thrift shopping scene was perfection 🥲
i could watch this shit for hours
bored but exciting hahaha love u:)
the blue butterfly shorts i NEEEED 😭😍
Does any one know the fit of jeans she’s wearing?
ily
Your videos have aged like fine wine This out of all the European countries, has been favorite country so far
the last time i went to greece, i started my period unexpectedly and not a single applicator. going to europe is always a learning experience ❤️
I love you emma 🫶🏻
the way you cut cheese is so upsetting ahah
lose tampons is confusing me cause it’s really good for the environment but it’s not hygienic at all
these socks dudeeee SMAAAAASH
PETITION TO INCLUDE YOUR DAD IN YOUR VIDEOS
I can’t wait to make enough money to travel the world
cómo es que mi reina todavía no usa copita menstrual?
Video for gringos, si boring.
THIS DUO OMG
Neurótica!!!!!!
I love these videos so much. Very calming and charming!
how does she always have jeans that are the perfect fit!!
the is that a fucking pigeon is the same exact words from the book reminders of him...and she doesn't even know that but how good 😭😭
emma how do you cut your cheese my god
Where is the blue sweater from pleeease i need to know
Oh my gosh! Can’t believe you were here! Hope Amsterdam treated you well 😌☺️
She has my type of humor
this city is made for emma
emma's struggle with the tampon kinda made me laugh because it’s literally normal for europeans to not use an applicator cause it’s way more sustainable
I just love the vibes :3
How in the world can she be this comfortable in front of her dad
al fin pude tomarme un momento de descanso para ver el vlog, te amo emma <3
You're last few travel vlogs are giving me SO MUCH LIFE. I WANT TO CRAWL INSIDE THE TV (like the ring) AND LIVE INSIDE THEM. I don't remember the last time Ive felt so much joy I could cry while consuming something. All I can say I guess is thank you.
God job
🫶🏻
There is some existential sadness mixed with a sparkle of magic and love for life in Emma's eyes and I absolutely love it!
I’ve watch the clip with the dog like 15 times. Never gets old
Love you Emma
😍😍😍😍🥵
OMG YES THAT’S WHERE I’m FROM
this is therapy for me
i love this one
Lol emma being freaked out by the "loose" tampon, do you guys only use tampons with aplicators in the US? Thats super wasteful
i love the alignment with the podcast it's so fun to watch this after listening to the episodes
Why would ship things home when you can just pay for extra luggage?
Ok, her and Chalamet in a Wes Anderson flick now!
oooo look at that shoofly pie croissant
I am really wondering why can't she buy another and bigger carry on or luggage bag? ;d
I feel like you’re going to different countries just for the café=)))))im not complaining though
2:00 the way that person just DRAGGED the dog backwards SENT ME 😂
Wow was this relaxing or what
Belgian chocolate is even better
That haul was EVERYYYYTHINNNGGGG!!!!
I’m getting ready for work while watching this...this feels so relaxing and rewarding ❣️ thank you Emma
The haul part is giving 2018 emma gonna cry brb
so weird to see you in the space that I live. two worlds colliding🥰 always shop at the episode too.
2:34 oh my god WHY DOES EVERY WOMAN OR GIRL FREAK OUT ABOUT THIS JUST PUT IT IN
this was soo good.
Welcome to the European tampon world
The dancing haul…golden
You said it correctly. Great that you are teaching others about what our coffeeshop means haha. That's why I always have to remind myself every time I hear foreign people say coffeeshop, it's different!
Imagine working at the Reception and emma calls for a tampon. Literally would be so honoured to bring her one.
Emma Chamberlain...you are hilarious. xxx
the fun part is that I’m rn in Amsterdam at a trip
“No coffee, no workee” made me laugh way harder than it should have
I guess emma needs scissors only to remove tags from her new clothes😂
❤️
i wonder if thrifting there is as high a price over there like it is in the US
1:54
how many times have you gone to cheese store and just looked at the limburger cheese, can I call you a chicken shit tampon, oooooo croissant limburger pizza that is better than a calzone/ at at tampon- space program  🦨#$%^&*(@#$%^&*(ever try a tuna belly bacon BLT it looks good on a croissant too/(at) Hungary's  your looking like the dog that was going to bite you, but it new you wasn't smart enough to get to get the limburger pizza or the dog collar cut dry aged tuna steak with belly and ribs all connected, because looks like someone already got his dog collar cut whiskey hashish barrels beef or tuns steak/ look it a Frisbee ball with peanut butter/ just let me hold on to your dog collar/ poor Emma late to the game/ Emma bean / don't like your coffee shaking; maybe smaller yellow fin bracelet cut is more your bag and there are other types of tunas and will be surprised what's at a captain's table
Watching your videos is so comforting ♥️ i can't explain
When I’m watching these videos I get sad when they end, just so peaceful and calming. Keep doing you Emma 🤍
Missed Amsterdam so much, missed Emma. Meaning, I LOVE THIS VIDEO
There's something cinematic about the simplicities of life, and Emma and her Dad capture it so perfectly.
Seeing Emma in Albert Heijn is something i never expected to see, ever
HOPE U LIKED ITTTT
I found a crime scene this morning and i was just thinking to myself it’s so weird how Americans get them with applicators😂😂😂
The melody where she is looking at the market for tampons ???
Loving the spooky vibes
okay she reads colleen hoover???
Omg I am European and have never seen a tampon with an applicator it's so funny to me to see this kind of struggle 😂
much love <3 -some dutch girl
her vlogs are so comfy💗
very curious how many people have already gone to that one store to see if the red shorts are still there because Emma wore them😂
i find it so weird how americans only have tampons with applicators, especially considering the amount of plastic waste that comes with them
thanks for hanging out with me!
Lived in Amsterdam for roughly 4 years.. Fell in love with this city and this video made feel so nostalgic. Hopefully life will bring me there again soon. Thank you Emma.
I LIVE THERE HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
12:13 HA nice synchronising touch
11:52 BEAUTIFUL shot.
These are my favorite videos please make a ton more they’re so nice to watch
Please keep blessin us with ur videos
Those are the type of tampons my mum uses 🤷🏾‍♀️
Emmas hoarding tendencies make me cringe. Lol
my comfort
so ALL tampons in the US are with aplicators..? wow
14:30 “is that a fucking pigeon” she definitely read reminders of him
You missed out on the best chocolate place in amsterdam :(((
mahal kita >>>
Cool vid!
emma u r funny love your videos
I ❤ everything about this video! Good job 👍🏻
I appreciate the edit where you're flipping through the pants in accordance to the music
Emma I missed you
i want the shoes
waiting for the next video
Does anyone wants to share the music Emma used 🥺🥺🥺
I love this duo of you and your dad. Your dad gets amazing B roll but its still you.
11:52 best clip ever made, it's so cute
I. LOVE. EUROPE. 😭
Not me silently screaming for Emma to buy that man's painting huhu
yessss
That pup looked liked the softest gentlest pup in the world!
What's the name of the socks shop?
I love your short nails : )
Netherlands will forever be on my bucketlist perhaps why I like this clip sm. Plus I love croissant. But Emma, I lost it at @2:49 😅
loose tampons are better than with applicators cause at least u know how u shove it in yk..  like to get it sit comfortably
omg the tattoos
it’s the dog walking backwards for me- 😂😂 2:03
I think emma would love Kraków, Poland, as we probably have the biggest amount of pigeons in the world. <3
I love your new vlog style.
They definitely got high together
The way her dad film her vlog is amazing! I mean he literally waited a couple second before he came out the lift to get a good shot
shipping home clothes is so real my gosh
who is the videographer?
dear emma, you made me smile.
THE HAULLLLLL 🥹👌🫶🏼♥️
Can somebody make a 10 hour long movie on Emma please?
como pode uma loira ser minha melhor amiga
I started crying during the try on haul 😭 Felt so reminiscent of her old videos and made me happy to see her more grown up now but still having fun. Love you Emma ❤
the amount of bereals i saw with you
you are the best
fav emma video yet
14:31 am i the only one who thought of scotty from reminders of him by colleen hoover when she said that?
Morning Beautiful
HOW DID YOU CUT THE CHEESE  As a french person that was physically hard to watch haha
Emma is literally my confort zone
I love every single thing about this video
Emma, why don’t you just pack a “backpack” or small carry on with just 2 outfits and when you get to your destination, buy a carry on case, AND THEN buy outfits there. Thoughts?
When she showed the tampon I'm usually using and asked why is there no applicator 😭😭 I never thought it could have it
The look straight into my brain when Emma said “what’s a loose tampon” 😂😂😂😂 gurl I don’t know 🤷‍♀️😂
omg its so funny to watch things like the tampon incomprehension and how you cut the cheeseeee as an dutch 💀💀 brighten up my day tysm
The song Amsterdam by Pool, you’re welcome
the way she cut her cheese broke my little dutch heart
DID THE BEE SURVIVE? 😂
09:25 emma channeling her inner björk
What’s a loose tampon?… - emma
2:03 moonwalking dog
i missed you
💜
https://youtu.be/LjtqPFdMVVo 🤦🏿‍♂️
I feel like this is Emma’s response to Jack Whitehall’s “travels with my father”
Fine, I'm going to Amsterdam
imagine the confusion when I tried getting tampons in America, what is this extra thing that comes with it.
the intro Amsterdam is wild lolololol
Dude where did you get those glasses though
The haul turned dancing fashion show has me in tears! Emma‘s energy is simply unmatched!!!
8:13 ... I think she is an ISTP
leuke video, Friesland is nog mooier moet je ook eens heen gaan :)
OMGGG I MISSED EMMA
this is my favourite of the travel videos so far!
anyone knows what the music is at the beginning? pleaaaase
loved EVERY second of the video
emma just casually keeping the internet alive
Did she read reminders of him
Thank you so much for sharing your journeys with us, and making my morning calmer and happy!~ ☺️❤️
Emmy It's Oscar wining cinematography :)
To travel with my father all over Europe is my new goal
That "friend" from earlier was not a bee dear... that is a fricking scary wasp lol
Emma I miss the forehead kiss so much ):
and just like that, we'll never know what the scissors were for
emma needs a travel show
I love Emma. She dresses like an old man. It’s silly
Please never stop
Why not get one more suitcase?
Emma goes to the supermarket wich my sister and I went this summer in Amsterdam !! Omg
Low-key film making masterpiece
come to south africa but in cape town
As a European, I don't get the applicator thing (ob is the best)...
"Who left my granola open?!?! It's fucking stale.." hahahaha😅
i love how emma makes us travel with her. loving so much this type of videos >3
Loooooved the dancing haul
anyone know where the Photo Booth she went to is?
i studied abroad in amsterdam in 2020, spent 7 months there and it was easily the best era in my life so far. so much nostalgia from this video <3
Papa chambo is so good at the composition of some of these shots it feels like they could be just as good as a still
How fashionable you are！
The editing on this video is absolutely beautiful
what fu**ing piece of art did i just watch that shit gaveeeeee
mom wake up emma chamberlain posted
So weird to see this… i mean living in the Netherlands but then thinking that we were in the same country at the same time 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
IF you like cheese with alot of flavour, swedish västerbotten is really good, and marabou chocolate
I feel like americans are the only ones who really use applicators for tampons 😂
I live in the Netherlands in Amsterdam
why this 12:12 matches soo perfectly, even timing! I`m obsessed
At 9:52 there were Ghanaians talking in the background while you were eating snacks and that just made my life
Every shot is a moving painting, good lord
best youtuber of all time
The tampon situation is so funny to me everytime americans and europeans discover the differences
I LOVE THIS GIRL SO FREAKIN MUCH 😭🤍
masterpiece
watching this as a dutchie from amsterdam, I love how you portrayed my city!
The way the beat of the music matched perfectly when she was looking at the jeans 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
Your dad is the best....taking the 🐝 out of your soup🤩
I’ve just recently started listening to her podcast and it’s helping me thru my breakup ☺️❤️❤️
OK Emma. I I am telling you, I have used loose tampons my whole life and recently the OB brand included in your video has been scarce at stores so I’ve had to use tampons with applicators. I’ve never been more disappointed. I have never had as many leaks accidents of sorts in my whole life until I started using the applicator ones. Not to mention the OB brand gives you like 40 a pack for like six dollars. I’m telling you and everyone else who’s willing to listen that y’all are sleeping on loose tampons, no reason to be grossed out by your own body you don’t need an applicator.
America is like the only place youll see so much plastic used to wrap tampons.
Its funny how you find it confusing to get loose tampons. When I was in New York it was crazy to me, that there is always an applicator. Unusual in Europe...
Yes european tampons usually dont come with an applicator! U just have to shovve it in there unfortunately. Remember to wash ur hands before and after😭
michael scott vibe
are coffee shops rlly for weed? i love it there already
I love uu
emma, you and your vlogs are my comfort. whenever i am having a hard time sleeping, i just watch your vlogs and i am gonna feel asleep not because your vlogs are boring but it is because i find you and vlogs comforting. stay safe, queen! 💙
Loved the haul
Buy a reusable silicone cup. You can carry it with you while you travel, always. And this will never happen to you again :) also better for the planet.
netherlands have my heart
I love that she's back uploading I miss her so much 😘🤗🧡💕
Emma🤍
it's rlly good to see you having a good time <3
i just know the girl at 11:50  wanted to buy such a cute shit and hadnt enogh money. So she walked up the sweetest face to her boy and ask for some more coins. And he hesitated no second. Loved it!!
This was definitely my favorite one of these videos so far 🤍
the haul part killed me
Emmas videos are something different..you know she is an amazing person and loves her fans, the travel vlogs are EVERYTHING😍
When Emma said “check it” like it was something and it was a danish😭😭😭
help, does anyone know what the style of the shirt she’s wearing is called? i used to see them everywhere in 2014 but now they don’t sell them anymore.
Patiently waiting for the Venice vlog
Te amo
I thought I was being pranked the first time I bought tampons in Italy. Haha but they're better for the environment!
i loved the try-on haul!
Hi im also from amsterdam, hope you enjoyed! im jealous of all the people who did meet you tho
Just a heads-up about the toxic shock syndrome associated with using tampons like that*
Her dad filming reminds me of when she’d have him film her in SanFran. omg 💛
It’s so fun that u are in the Netherlands. I live here.  I never understood that everybody in the USA is using like the Tampax tampons, here is it normal to just shuff it in 😂  But i hope u loved it here
Emma chamberlain loml.💟💌💞💕💗
I’m dying at the tampon that looks like a lip balm
I really wanna know who take care of here cats if she always traveling
Long shot but can anyone tell me what Levis shape she is wearing?? 501s?
I was today years old I learned not everyone knows what a tampon without a applicator is 🙋🏼‍♀️
I was in the same position when I traveled to the US for the first time. couldn't figure out how to use a tampon WITH an applicator lol
I laughed quite considerably when that dog started running like Scooby-Doo . 🤣
please be my friend
❤❤❤❤
love that youre loving ams. one of my favorite places to travel to
I wonder how Emma gets in these places w ppl no flocking around her
and heres me, whos never used a tampon WITH aplicator.. the OB ones are my usual ones.
Emma, your ability to reach new levels of relatability with each thing you do never ceases to amaze me. A close-up of yourself with pain au chocolat crumbs around your mouth? A trip to buy tampons? I could go on and on. You're incredible. I love you.
I need to quit my job and travel.
this makes me miss amsterdam
I hope Emma realizes the power she has to heal the world with her videos. I live for the potential of waking up to a new Emma's vlog.
the transition from the elevator tampon haul to the beautiful scenery >>>😭
For someone who's dutch, watching Emma in Amsterdam is so weird to me hahah
who films her??
THE COUPLE at 11:50
Where can I find this t-shirt PLEASE 6:27 it’s perfect
Absolutely loved it ❤️
please Emma ,dont do ever surgery! you are naturally perfect don't be a plastic girl! have a good life and youre dad too!
Im Dutch and from Amsterdam, I wanna know where that man who paints is located I wanna buy some of his art🥺
When do you come in France girl ?
Us europeans be like: wtf is an applicator? 😂
Went to Amsterdam for my honeymoon! Love it there so much
Thanks Emma, you make me so calm with your videos!! I enjoyed. Great dance Xdxd.
Did You figure out why you bought scissor ??? I’m curious !!!
I loooove that u went to amsterdammmm
An applicator?
I live for Emma’s videos
Emma, why do you always remind me to make myself a cup of coffee?! For some reason, in my mind, you are my coffee reminder. Great video, I hope you had fun in Amsterdam! Sending you love and good vibes! x
Is that a fucking pigeon?!  Iykyk
war es eigentlich aus so dreckig wie bei uns?
I am probably not the only one who noticed that she looks so much more happier anywhere but in LA. Also, I love how they support each other with her dad!  Keep it going queen, love you to the moon and back!  (Kinda missing forehead kisses but no offense❤)
Los videos de Emma me dan años de vida
Thats a normal tampon in germany 😂how do They Look in america
coffee cheese and chocolate was so bold i'd explode from inside out
Emma has got Michael Scott energy 😂
the way I'm in Amsterdam every day and haven't spotted you
7:43 you can hear a random man speaking danish in Amsterdam. For a moment I thought you were in copenhagen again lol.
I never understood why Americans used applicators for tampons! In Australia we see it as a waste of single use plastic Ive only known one brand that has them (Tampax) and no one uses them
this is just perfect
No applicators in Australia. I had the opposite shock when living in New York.
Welcome to Emma's tampon TED talk.
Is that a fucking pigeon? 🤪
This is therapy for me
emma dances are back
seeing Americans try to make sense of Europe is hilarious ...like one of *the* most famous thing about Amsterdam is coffee shops ...also tampons just coming "without" an applicator is so normal here
Te credits were actually so cute
At this point I just stop whatever I’m doing every time there’s a new video.  P.S. does anyone know where her sunglasses in the beginning of the video are from? They’re so cool.
It’s so cool to see you in my city!
I’ve dreamed about traveling around europe since I was kid but now I don’t feel like I want to cuz I feel like l already did with Emma through recent videos.
I wanna live in emmas vlogs.
ah yes de albert hijn ,good store
I was in Amsterdam a couple days ago!!
I love seeing my country through someone else's eyes.
Regarding the tampon issue: Europe doesn't have applicators. When i found out you guys (americans) have tampons in these plastic straws - applicators as Emma said - i was CHOCKED. It is very smart but also not at all good for the environment with all the plastic? Or is it in plastic? Please correct me if I'm wrong.
im always in Amsterdam and now that Emma is there I’m not there 😡
we want old school emma vlog plsss
When you’re currently in Amsterdam and haven’t seen Emma at all😭
I never had anything else then a „loose“ tampon! 😂 didn’t even know there is something like an application thing
I love how this video also kinda shows details
So nice to see you visited my country.Amsterdam is so beautiful!!I like the vintageshop you bought those clothes I go to visit it myself next time I am in Amsterdam.You inspire me every time.Lots of love 😘😘
Amsterdam is really one of the most beautiful cities 🫶🏼
In Europe, they sell tampons without the applicator. I find it easier to use 🤷
This tampon situation is normal in Europe 😂
the best photo booth card what i ever seen!!!!! hope i’ll see it on pinterest soon<33
"Is that a fucking pigeon" iykyk
This is a long shot but… Anyone know where the blue jumper is from?
You must never see your poor kitties
Wow those tampons are so normal in Australia. Would be hard with fake nails tbh lol. Reusable period undies ftw! Xx
Hi who does the filming
emma you're like my own therapy
I've been loving the change of style, yet at the beginning of the video when she talks about the tampon and her period you know it's still her 😂
matching the music to the swiping of the jeans :)
LOTS OF LOVE FROM LEH LADAKH ❤❤❤
my friends and i literally called ourselves “the pigeons” in middle school… this makes your pigeon love really relatable for us
I am 21 years old and i have never used a tampon with an applicator, I think it may be an American thing?
According to you which is more prettier and livable between Copenhagen and Amsterdam..... please 🙏🏻 give me an honest unbiased answer please 🙏🏻🤗✨🥰 and please do emphasize why would you pick it 🤗🌼 Loved your video btw📷❤️
Omg Emma I moved to AMS from NYC exactly one year ago today and my first cultural shock was the tampons!! I stockpile them from the US now.
The tampon situation had me cracked up, so they always come with an applicators in the us?
I wanna like this a million times
The hotel staff watching Emma do her haul through the hallway cameras 😳
i love this style of vlog! Emma and her dad are killing it! Every time it jumps to a scene of the streets or the boats its like jumping to a new scene in a film..so beautifully done and honestly just really enjoyable to watch.
Seeing her walking in the streets with her phone on her back pocket stresses me outtt. I would never do this in Europe 😅
Welcome to Netherlands Emma !! :)
NO WAYYYY
I so badly want Emma and her father to go to London and meet up with Grace Booth (aka Grackle) and her father. Both of their dads are artists and it would just be so wholesome.
You just shove the tampon in with your finger what’s a effing tampon applicator? 😭
aw old school emma vibes with the try on and music
tbh, the first time ive been to the netherands........ WEED IS EVERYWHERE!!! i saw a couple of them in DRINKS like tequila and vodka!!! (another weird thing...... theres cocaine vodka too lool)
aww the cat shirt, she wore it at her pb and j video
It's so fun seeing her in my city 💛 And I loved the haul hahah
Are you afraid of your own body? 😅 Too much plastic with those applicators.
The synchron between the music and the jeans  so cute
♥️😭😍🥹 luv ur videosss
I honestly have chills after watching this because it was so so good
Cinematography  and Editing  simply sublime 🔥🔥
♡♡♡
do American ppl don't know the difference between coffewhops in nl and cafes?????
The video style is everything Emma your dad and you be killing it girl never stop so glad to see you back I’ve missed you ❤ hope all is well
Miffy chocolates 💜
The way the endings always make me feel
Emma you are so freakin good made my day w this video thank u girlll
A masterpiece
the way the song matched the haul dance perfectly omg
I love this
Does anybody know where that sock shop is?? 😫
I LOVE THESE NEW VLOGS OF EMMA'S But those quirky funny videos will always be missed
02:36 that’s how we all do it here in Europe lol (at least in Northern Europe I think…)
Hello 💗🌸🌼
welcome in my country 🎉
where is jesse hoefnagels
❤️
The music matching to her flipping the jeans was actually so cool🤌🏻✨✨
😂who's recording u
i love that she was in the netherlands i- 🥹 wish i could’ve met you
Tampons without applicator are a common thing in Europe.
🤍🤍🤍🤍
Emma u r so good at editing
🤍🤍🤍
this literally made my day
Emma's videos make me feel wrapped in a blanket while it's snowing outside.. . . . While I live in a tropical country. lol
❤️❤️❤️
loved everything in this video ❤❤❤❤❤
you have applicators for tampons ??? WTF is wrong with people in the US ??? 😵‍💫
Never learnt about much info on tampons til this video 😂😂😂😂
I love you, Emma.
those pigeon socks are fire
Yaaass! I would’ve like to meet you in Amsterdam! Keep the good vibes ❤
as australian, it’s weird to me that applicators are the norm in america. here they’re the training bras of tampons lol
It was fun to wach, thanks!
my favorite person to my favorite country, perfection 💜
My favourite place✨
About the painter at around 9:00 — my mom works with him and he’s genuinely one of the sweetest people she knows. We have one of his paintings in our hallway, I see them everyday. Amsterdam misses you already Emma xx!
Emma keeping youtube alive
Emma in the Albert Heijn lol
So I made a tiktok where you walked behind me in Haarlem (800k views) and I'm sooooo happy to now finally see this video!!! OMG.
American's are so weird with their applicators. You just stick it in, not that complicated 😂
in Europe we don't really use applicators for tampons tbh
When Americans dont realise how to use a tampon. BAHAHAHAHAHA. It's better for the environment girl!
yo does anyone knows the music which was played in start??
Lol as a German girl we don't have tampons with applicators and I was so confused when I bought tampons with applicators in Dublin on accident so I had like the opposite problem 😂
i love this woman. i have never found a single person on youtube that i can just watch for years and years and still enjoy her content. i feel like me and her kind of grew up together and it makes my heart so full and warm whenever she posts
Omg emma u was here gosh I'd love to meet u hehe 😂 you are awesome
Wish I was there I couldve seen u
i love this.
I’m so glad I got to visit one last time before I found out I was pregnant! Amsterdam always ❤ ps, I hope u went into a coffee shop xx
Wow this was so good 🙊I luv traveler Emmaaaa
i mean im really addicted to her travel vlogs
THIS IS THE BEST VIDEO I´VE EVER SEEN. thank you. the jeans clip?WOWOWOW? the HAUL???CAN´T STOP SMILING!!! ly EMMA
As everyone is saying, your father with a camera is a beautiful magic🥰
watching her makes me freakin happy for some reason lol
As a Dutchie I'm feeling proud/happy that's she's showing the Netherlands, but also sad because I should be at that coffee place meeting her duhh...
Loved.
the aplicators are such rubbish, just use your finger... everyone in Europe does ist... less plastic and better control :D
i adore this entire vlog so much !! all the little moments are so wonderfully captured 🫶🏽😭 the haul modelling is everything emma so cute!!!! and the pigeon socks??? that’s everything so slay
as a dutch girl im so excited
Omg when were u heeeeree
https://youtu.be/Nod7vrxzmWU
You'd swear Emma is Michael Scott's child
Hahah in Europe we don’t have applicators for our tampons. Not in Sweden either. We are used to it. I guess you americans are very spoiled😉
This music is very Zelda
Dancing in the end ❤️❤️❤️it’s gorgeous
I swear to God, it was the best haul I’ve ever seen in my whole freakin’ life
Can't wait for Emma to do vlogmas
"you might end up eating a chocolate croissant that sends you into another dimension!" I have felt this because my Dutch roommate once gave me a "space cake" thinking it was normal cake and I was floating in space the whole night!
At 7:45, super random, but there’s a danish guy speaking in the background and it confused me for a second because of her recent Copenhagen video 😂
Im dutch and the first time I tried a tampon I got the ones with applicator because that’s what I saw all the American Bethany mota type girls use on YouTube. My mum thought I was crazy and I thought the applicator was so weird and now I’m back to the good ol finger
As always, Emma’s video made my day. Now I’m living in the Netherlands, feeling so close 😀
I love this but why did she cut the cheese like that😫 as a dutchie that gives me the ick ahhaha no but i love this content
Those first shots are my hometown, Haarlem. I live next to that mill. Not Amsterdam!
So fresh and so calm . Wish i could make something like this . Love her.
Emma posted. My day was just saved by an angel.
The fact that she's talking about tampons in front of his dad 🤣
I think it’s so funny because as a dutch person I find it so difficult abroad to use tampons with applicator because I am used to the ones without 😂
I'll be there in two days 🔥🔥🔥🔥
You were in my hometown and I didn’t know?!
You put this beyond tired mama to sleep 😍 i wait till the end I swear ..
I miss you Emma 🥹 please make more videos like the old days 🥲
Love your black short sleeve turtle neck top❤ 🐢
I love u
Good afternoon 🌅
I got a feeling that I travel with u, its amazing, thank you, hug and kiss 🤍
This video feels so comforting to watch. It reminds me that not everything needs to be so busy and constantly doing something "fun". Like you can just chill and enjoy your coffee or cheese and go thifting and it's still a great day. I kind of feel weird watching traveling videos where they are always on the go to do something big. Enjoying the little things.
It's true, us Dutch people we usually don't buy the tampons with applicators. We just use our on board device called the finger, and wash our hands as we would always. 💜
That Bee heard the soup was amazing at that restaurant. He wanted to join you Emma 😂👍🐝
This is chaotic yet so neat. I don't know how to describe it . It makes u want more..
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
ahhh this is amazing !
Emma! Hope you have a great time in Europe in general! For your space problem, i recommend you to just buy another suitcase and add it to your ticket back home, so you don't have to ship things back one at a time. It will spare u time and money and i think it's just easier 🧡 Come visit Greece sometime too!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️☕️
"what's a loose tampon?" —one of the greatest philosophical questions of our time
WHY DOES THE DOG RUN LIKE THAT WHEN HES BARKING IM DEADDDD😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 2:06
That’s so nice😍
We want the vlog in Veniceeee!
I knew I shouldn’t be eating while watching this video ! thanks Emma 😳🥴🤢
That thing Emma did with the music and the clip at 12:13 was actually so good and fun
te amooooo
You can buy the Tampax brand which is with applicator even in Europe. 🙂
I JUST ADORE THIS GIRL AND THE FACT THAT HER DAD IS NICE ENOUGH TO TRAVEL WITH HER AND SHOOT HER VIDEOS, AND HER PUTTING ENDING CREDITS OMG 😭🤍😵‍💫🥹🫠🫶🏼
Emma I miss you so much!! I’m so thankful for you and the things you’ve inspired me
ALBERT HEIJN
EMBA IS SO THERAPEUTIC <3333 and a whole comedian HAHAHAH
These videos literally give me life
americans culture shock at realising most of the world dont use tampons with applicators hahahahah
The most comfort video i've ever seen
Your dad is really doing the lord’s work here Emma ❤️🧿
one of my favorite videos
Oh Amsterdam is so beautiful. I fell in love with the city two years ago and am really looking forward to going back there. Big recommendation, anyone traveling there, check out the Museum of the Canals.
in Australia tampons dont come with applicators. my mind was blown when i first visited america
I think this applicator is one of the biggest plastic wastes ever. Tampons already generate enough waste through their packaging alone and you can insert tampons so easily and safely even without an applicator. I for one am pretty overwhelmed at the thought of using an applicator because I see a much higher risk of injury in doing so.
Great!
I thought the queen has pass but here she is all well and very much alive
This was phenomenal ❤
Pure joy for the people watching and day dreaming. Love this content creator so much.
Elite
The thrifting and dance haul is giving old Emma but in an elevated way 🥰
So sad for her knowing that if only she'd use a 'bonuskaart' she could've had a discount on her tampons 😂
💗💗
also the bit when emma just stops mid sentence and leaves because the elevator arrived to the floor cracks me up
Have you been intimate with Kristen Stewart yet…
I LOVED your travel series Emma!!! You and your Dad are the best duo and these videos were absolutely amazing💖💖
The excitement about pigeon socks made my day
13:00 reminds me of the old emma!!! 😂
My heart is full
when is the travel series coming? Iced coffee round the world pleaseee
The way you did dance at the end made my day :)
I'm in love with this style of vlogging, honestly <3 you and your dad's vibe matches soooo much
It’s so heartwarming to see your favorite YouTuber/celebrity doing their thing in your country, when they’re usually on the other side of the world.
I think u bought a scissor to crop some clothes😺
That dance haul was exquisite Emma
that haul was something man 😂😂
Every time I see tampons from the US in videos I wonder why the packages are sooo big. Now it makes sense - because in Europe it’s totally normal to have no applicator 🙈
Love this video😍
the clothing haul was my favorite part and the background music with it was iconic ❤️‍🔥
the tampon situation got me in stitches. I didn't even know there were applicators until I watched the nosebleed scene in "She's the man" .Welcome to the Netherlands, where we like to get our hands dirty.
It was a movie
Whom ever is editing these videos now is 👌🏻
As a french person, watching you cut the cheese like that….😢
I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS VIDEOOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why you didn’t show the high part
I love your Europe vids so much
Love your glasses, does anyone know what brand is that?
Lol I’m in Austria right now! Slay
so calming n warm
Post more please I miss your vids
Emma, how are you cutting that cheese 😭😭. Please do it horizontale next time
What the..? No forehead kiss?
Weed Coffee shops are the reason I go to Amsterdam.. 😂 unfortunately I don’t go to another dimension .. I just have a nice time.. 👍🏻
the haul was sooo good hahaha
The video is so sweet!  Thanks, Emma and Michael ❤️
this is like.. ur best video so far
The music matching up with the way you were flipping thru pants, I will think about this often
Lol I would be creeped out if I got a tampon with an applicator because I wouldn't know how to use that.
Michael, the shots, I mean... And Emma's editing (and directing?), it feels like chaos wrapped in an expensive ceramic. Like, it's fresh, crazy, and carefree, yet somehow there's a fragility to it. I wish I was just being dramatic, but this is really what it is. I can't even explain. SO GOOD, you guys!
Just discovered these four most recent videos today and watched them all back to back. Really enjoyed them a lot. Peaceful but also there were a lot of good funny moments. Glad to see you back :)
this whole video is major Michael Scott energy ❤
✨☺️
Omg so cool that you’re here!! I live in Amsterdam!
pretty sure the scissors were meant to cut off the price tags from your shopping 😂
Yeeeeeessssss it’s very strange to see you walk in the shops that I shop in but I love it 🐦🐦
i live in the center and it’s so weird to see her walk around the same streets as me lmaoo
The random people on the street being filmed 👁👄👁
that's so good
Emma reminds me of the mom on parent trap 😭😂 I love it .
is that a fucking pigeon
Okay  I’m officially the person who finds book references anywhere like when she said is that a fucking pigeon while going through the socks I was instantly like OMG REMINDERS OF HIM reference
I lived in the Netherlands for three years because my father was in the military it’s crazy to think about
i love the way americans always have to put the country after the city name, even when it's one of the most popular cities in the world and everyone already knows where it is. london, england. amsterdam, netherlands. paris, france. 😂
I giggled when the first shot was in Haarlem not Amsterdam🙃 love to see my hometown in your videos Emma🥰
The way the dog slides 02:04. I'm dead 😭💀
What is the genre of music she puts in the bg ? Can someone tell me what’s it called
0:57 I miss her Dad so much 💕☹️  He is so talented in taking pictures and filming I like this video and last video sooooo much it's smooth and calming
I don’t know why but you really remind me of a young Ellen Degeneres 🤷🏻‍♀️ btw tampons without applicators are SO difficult .
Amsterdam is lovely - the tour you can do is really good. aA a new vlogger - really enjoy watching your vlogs and learning to improve mine 💗
wow I love this
such a beautiful videographer emma (: you and your father both
why is no one mentioning that you could have just bought a bigger suitcase to bring on the way home to fit the stuff you got lol
but where’s my forehead kiss? 🥺
What an iconic creative duo!
Your try on haul is the best i have ever seen from you
„There is no Aplecator“ this is so American why wash ur hands after when you can use plastic to throw away later…
THOSE PHOTOBOOTH PHOTOS ARE INSANELY GOOD
today i learnt what gleeking means … never knew that had a word
im traveling to Amsterdam and this makes me happy!!
Did anyone else realize tampons there are .85 cents or 2$
Can I just say? Thank you for making me smile 🤗
I’m Dutch and have never been to Europe. Everything reminded me of my grandparents. Like seeing wind mills are the real life version of my Oma’s decorations and I realized most Dutch words I know are related to cheese and food. Even seeing’s people who look like like me and have the same gait. My opa stoped speaking Dutch around us when we began to understand it. It was such a weird sensation to recognize so many things in a place you have never been. I’m so curious
I can’t explain how much I love this !!! Seeing Emma happy makes my happy too✨✨
any colleen hoover fans here?? she just said "IS THAT A F*****G PIGEON???"😭😭😭
ive been struggling with my dads death recently and seeing these beautiful videos knowing your dad is behind the camera makes me so happy. thank you for doing this
I feel like this is still emma in vogue lol that quality!👍🏻❤️
These videos are so nice cuz it feels like we're spending the day with you<3
i’ve never been so engrossed by someone video before, this was amazing… i really REALLY love your new style. it fits who you are now so incredibly well. also incredible videographer you have 😊 thank you for keeping us posted ❤️
In Brazil is the same tipe of tampons. And yah u have to put it inside babe
I can’t wait to go to Amsterdam myself (I have recently started my journey doing my bachelor in three different countries in Europe) I’m recording my whole journey 😏😂😂😂😂  Ps: can’t wait to then get my period in Amsterdam 😅✌🏼
I loved the haul segment😭 and overall I loved the cinematography from your dad and your editing, once again. Also when u did the photo-booth thing I was like ohhh this is how she did it for her insta lol love you em :)
nice you been in amsterdamm for 24 hours emma i was there on holiday for many years ago 👍
the intentional sync of music and jeans at 12:13 was so cool 😭
<33~
I need more travel vlog😭💖
MIFFY
I just fucking loved this
I LOVE AMSTERDAM
omg youre in the netherlands!
You just taught me the word gleeking. Didn’t know there was a word for that! Life changing…
the emma and mr chamberlain combo is timeless n wonderful
Emma would make a perfect female Michael scott if they ever decide to remake the office
Perfect, guys! I love it. Hope you enjoyed coffeeshops! lol
I FCKIN MISS YOU EMMA 😭😭😭😭 LOVE THIS VIDEO SM
The music with the jeans switching was chefs kiss!!!
The bee scene is underrated🐝😭❤️

i love emma
I live in Amsterdam omggg I'm so sad I didn't see you thereee.. and what you filmed is so close to my home 😭
Don’t you miss your cats?:(
The tampon part was so funny for me🤣  I had no idea that the tampon without the allocator can be a problem 😁
im so happy she goes into places and share it to us. she's a grown successful woman. so happy she's exploring new places
I really really loved every moment of this, thanks Emma ❤️
I am in love with how the photo booth pictures turned out. Put it on your mother’s fridge.
Whenever I’m sad or left out I just watch emma’s vlogs cause they help me so much! thank you emma for everything<3
🥹👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Never used or seen an applicator in my life 😅  never seen them in australia & now I live in the Netherlands, haven’t seen them here either!
The clothing tags…. That’s why you need scissors
Gooood I miss Europe, I need to go back 🥲
Ugh another masterpiece of a video was smiling the whole time
te amo mi reina gracias por darle felicidad a mi vida
the old man painting on the sidewalk out of a suitcase is the purest thing ever to exist.
1:31 I like how the audio from the previous clip just overlaps like shes thinking about her previous conversation
the sgt. peppers shirt omg.
I wish all travel vlogs were like this.
💗
i love how walkable this city is
lovedddd the try on haul :,)
wtf is an applicator???
These videos are stunning, in 100 years it will be the perfect example of YouTube.
I love these travel videos sooooooo much like sooooooooooooooo much keep on travelling please!!!!
This bring me comfort in the morning
Some of the most effortlessly enjoyable content on the internet.
Where is the blue sweater from ❤i love it Emma !
the way the music lined up as you sifted through the jeans, genius
Beauty. Nice views
So good to see your vids again ❤️🇿🇦♥️
this made me SO happy on a really bad day, thank you 🥲
I absolutely love  Amsterdam and also fell in love with the used clothing stores, so I totally get shipping half your clothes home so you can buy new used stuff! Converse tennis shoes, cashmere sweaters, funky handmade dresses were a few of my scores. Love your dance moves! Makes me wanna go back to my Dutch roots!
14:15 emma is traveling with her bf not her dad if u listen carefully she says “baby look”
God, I love this woman.
this girl is my dream girl since forever
The key to traveling with a carry-on: there are 2 ways. Either you leave with a couple of scanty items and leave room for the random shopping 🛍 sprees, or you simply ditch all your old clothes as you travel along ... bring old stuff that you're thinking of giving up and just leave them gradually behind as time goes on. That always works out for me!🙂 This is such a great masterpiece. I loved every bit of it! ❤❤
the couple at 11:53 is so cute !!!
i never love a youtuber as much as i love emma.
stop the haul 😂 i love it
loving everything and everyone rn<3
The Haul Montage brought Extreme Joy ✨ yes to dad’s film style yes to the edits yes to it all 🏆
“Is that a f ing pigeon” did anyone think of reminders of him
Love the 'hall' Emma.
i love you oml
I love Emmas dads camera skillsss and am gonna miss emmas europe vlogs!!
17:11 emma ???... oh wow
It must be tough for Emma to decide what to wear. She looks great with anything she puts on.
I LOVE U EMMA
good job not killing that bee.  We need to save all the bees we can.
16:00 i love you forever
9:45 "I just gleeked everywhere"
Dang Emma now you’ve got me craving cheese and chocolate ❤
the music lining up with the jeans?? something about the way the music and the filming of general vibes feels wes anderson to me
How does Emma always look like she belongs in every country she goes to?!
those glasses giving serious Michael Caine circa 70s vibes lol
Ladies and gentlemen Emma uploaded the new video 🎉
I got robbed in Amsterdam, but it is a lovely city.
Whoever's reading this, i pray that whatever you're going through gets better and whatever you're struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day! Amen
ITS MY DRRREEAAM TO VISIT AMSTERDAM😩 it’s beautiful 😍
the way the music lined up with her sifting through the jeans i am speechless
ILOVEYOUUUUU ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The bee really said “I’m here for a bee movie moment”
this shits gorgeous
Emmmaaaaaa ily lol
On the opposite side of the tampon debacle, I remember being in Europe and only being able to find tampons with applicators.... and the level of confusion I experienced was intense.
I like new videos but I miss the scene transitions with Emma's own drum playing, can't we mix those two styles togetherr
the haul>>>>😂so perfect. u got great pieces. please tell dad give us creators some video tips, this is sooo good!! also makes me want to revisit amsterdam… i spent a lot of times in the coffeeshops😅 wish i could’ve did more cafes. red light district tour was wildd🤣
I've watched Emma from screaming at her camera doing crazy edits to this glow up like dont get me wrong teenage emma videos were sooo fun to watch but these calmer~~ ones are just as enjoyable bec she's still authentic after all these years. Love her dad's cinematography style and Emma's edits always 10/10!!!
i just love you
anyone know the music at 3:18 ??
I love OB! good choice!
The extra sprinkle of magic that are in these videos now with Emma & her dad is unbeatable 😭🤍
For emma chamberlain
pure happiness
13:51 😭 emma !!!!!
there’s still grass where the train tracks are…. how nice. it’s the little things and i was like wow because i’ve never seen that before.
I'm so worried about Emma. She's gotten so skinny lately and is obsessed with food. I'm really concerned she has an ED. And touring Europe is a far cry from the previously relatable Emma. She is also obsessed with shopping. It feels like she has no purpose or goals. I really hope she is okay. I wish her all the best.
Awwww, when her dad takes the bee out of the soup for her u.u Wish I had a nice dad
I feel as though this is wierd to say but emma actually motivates me alot. like anytime I watch her videos afterwards i feel like being productive and working on my goals. I think it seeing how successful she has become even though I don't have the goal to become like her or be in any kind of enterainment career.
ugh i love thé out to
"... eating a chocolate croissant that sends you to another dimension.." OMG  so hilarious! Love love love
love
The fact that the tampon saga was filmed by her dad lol
Anybody know thos glasses called
So much happiness
I am so happy with this occasional travel vlogs. They are so aesthetic and relaxing.
is that a fucking pigeon?😥scotty
lived this video
Gleeked - To discharge a long, thin stream of liquid through the teeth or from under the tongue.
This. This video. Makes me so happy.
The fav sleep shirt from my most fav video of pb&j 🥺🥺
the haul at the end 🥹🥹🥹 felt like being back in the good old days ❤️‍🩹
sus videos me dan tanta paz <3
you're incredible. ily.
Why wouldn't you buy a luggage and check it in?
This felt like it was a show on the travel channel so peaceful
I honestly thought she was going to say "I shipped my pants"
Uhm so u always use applicator tampons? Just use ur finger🥴🤷‍♀️
emma, your videos always make my day so much happier. im sure you get comments like this so often, but they truly are a work of art and never fail to make me smile because their always so fun and calming at the same time? if that makes sense?  i dont know. i just wanted to thank you for your work because your videos truly are perfect and you seem like such a nice and caring person. i wish you the best.
I never wanted this video to end lol
THUMBS UP FOR THOSE SOCKS QUEEN
I LOVE YOU
YESS EMMAA!!🫶🏼👏
Question. Where exactly did you stay? Thinking about going!!
I wanted this video to never end! A masterpiece as always ❤️
A haul in the hall ? That's genius.
I can’t describe how happy u and ur videos make me feel
I'm a broke international student living in NL. I see Emma go into an AH, immediately I think "how is she going to pay in an AH?"
Tampon applicators arnt really a thing in Australia either. Iv never used one!
Emma is so goated its not even funny. Thank you for giving me inspiration
Funny how she’s gets so sidetracked lol “who left my granola last open “, “oh I did “😂😂
I miss Amsterdam, it was such a beautiful and cultural place… I remember visiting there for the first time and it was just breathtaking with the buildings built. One of the prettiest places of Europe
i love these european travel videos!
I’m gonna start spelling it like “fashian” now
Who films Emma’s vids?
"No coffee  No worky" - that's SO Emma
no emma you can’t put scissors in your carryon
just realized its her dad filming..... crying and throwing up (positive)
i absolutely love these videos. the clips, the editing and the music give such a good vibe and makes me want to travel the world
I hate applicators, they’re disgusting and harsh. No applicators are the way to go! Also OB is great, haven’t seen those in years 🙌
Yes em !
She looks like Chalamet
and i love u
my god i love these videos
Your content is more important than any series I have ever watched. I get so happy when you post!
simply amazing❤️❤️i think you will always be my favorite
I met Emma and tried to hit on her I tell the story on my channel
We love Amsterdam!  I hope you got to try some poffertjes!
Shut up the moment at 11:52 between that couple is so beautifully captured 😭
Emma’s face at 13:51 HAHAHAHAH it made my day
this is my favorite wes andersen film
Emma’s videos inspire me to keep trying when it comes to content creating!
Wait why didn’t she just buy a bigger bag and pay $30 at the airport
the clip at 11:53 is so wholesome omgggggg
Love these travel videos 💕
Delightful as always.... thank you
Okay but what is the name of the song at the beginning?!? 🔥🔥
that haul😭😭that is old Emma and I am dead😶😶
can’t believe when i first started watching you, you were baking in your mums little kitchen and now you’re bougie shopping in amsterdam🫶 also no coffee no workee socks were so on brand im surprised you didn’t get those LOL
emma i think if u cant fit any more clothes in ur luggage anymore, u should ship a box or container home
wow emma
i wish emma’s videos were 1 hour long
The minute I see a new video from you I watch it immediately! They are so soothing and entertaining at the same time!
new core memory buying tampons w ur dad
tampons with applicators is a waste of money
Te amo
I'm amazed by how interesting Emma's videos are.  I can't stop watching.  I think it's because Emma breaks all the rules.  All the Youtube growth hacking gurus will tell you to niche down.  They say never make a vlog channel because vlogs are dead.  Don't try to vlog like Emma Chamberlain until you're as popular as her.  But Emma never followed anyone's rules but her own.  That's why she's popular.  When you follow someone else's rules...you are not being true to yourself.  Being yourself requires a lot of courage, but it will make you as popular as you will ever be.
i didn’t want this video to end
hi emma! dont worry about bees in your food! they don’t actually contaminate it like flies for example, so your soup was good to go or to eat lol
Pigeon sock shopping!
The Beatles long sleeve 😍😍😍 I’d definitely wear that too lol
im loving these vlogs fr
24hrs series gets better and better.
i guess we'll never know if you could put scissors in your carry-on.
Why can’t you buy another luggage and just check it in at the airport?
I hope you went back Emma to the old man to buy 3-5 paintings to hang. Up in your house. Because they are so beautiful and they just catch the essence of Amsterdam. You know?
Im so glad you were so happy here.😊🥲 Makes me proud to see
I love your videos and your dad!
these videos are my favorite
this aint no vlog. this is a sitcom 😭😭
the man painting was soooooo cute omg made me teary love old people <3
im not gonna lie but i got a little nervous by those eyes 2:50 👀😳
te amo
Thrifting in Amsterdam is one of my favorite memories I have there! Well, that and the brownie I got at a coffee shop lol
this is so random but THE GRASS ON THE TRAIN TRACKS AT 5:07 IS SO COOL AND BEAUTIFUL AND LIKE WHAT WHY DONT ALL TRAIN TRACKS DO THIS YK? LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE A MAGICAL PATHWAY AND IT IS SO COOL.
I was in Amsterdam in March and you were in the same spots I was, I’m obsessed
te amo
I love Emma’s new content lol!
I feel so safe here
emma chamberlain doing her europe tour

I think this might be the best YouTube video I’ve ever seen
I actually prefer tampons without applicators now 🤷‍♀️
I love this.
I love Your videos ⚡️✨👍
Emma videos make my week! <3
wheres my forehead kiss:(
This video just made my day, month, year and decade. Your videos are my safe place. Hurray!!! 🎉
Saying "stale" instead of "dry". Looks like you've been working a lot on your vocabulary lately. Kudos to you, Emma
Where is her blue sweater from!!!!!
Those pigeon sock are fly af

Chamberlain Paintings Stan ✊
i literally love emma so much 🥹
i love the way she's slowly getting used to film again, she makes me so happy <33
very highly entertaining
Loose tampon = more eco friendly 🤣🤣 also hmm, I might buy a new luggage bag instead of shipping stuff home
The guy that flys by on the bike wearing the suit at 16:22 did it for me🤣 Magical
I love how you’re visiting places that are so simple and real. The united states is a great but scary place.
ALBERTHIJN
“What’s a loose tampon?” 🤣🤣🤣
It is SO beautiful to watch your evolution!  I make YouTube videos in a similar spirit as yours and I just have to say it is so beautiful to watch you expand and shift your ways of storytelling and aesthetic - honestly such a powerful reminder to grow and stay fluid with our creativity - so thank you for that. Also LOVING that you and your dad are collaborating!
Emma getting out of LA version is so beautiful ❤ Always love u emma  You have no idea how much comfort you give me by videos and podcast🥺🤍
The way Emma stopped in mid sentence and just walked away lmaoo 4:44
Hahahaha, I LOVE the haul part. Best part of the video. ❤️
I love when American’s discover that only in America are applicators really a thing. As an Australian I don't even know what an applicator looks like😂
i love how on beat 12:13 was
the montage bit at the end was everything to me
“I can’t even eat it now” *two seconds later* **slurps**
this content is amazing it is almost like i am just chatting with a friend on vacation and getting coffee and i need those vibes
Waiiiit did Emma get tats?!?
te amo tantoooo
LMAOOO the dog being slide away in the back is so funny
these videos have been so great… love to see.
if u ever visit nl again: go to rotterdam! it's like the new york of the netherlands
The 90's movie clothing montage 😂
the guy at 11:53 🫣🫣
this was a truly amazing experience. i felt like i was there and it was so peaceful. alsoo, as a native ny’er, i MUST have those pigeon socks lmao the music, the cinematography, the color grading all 10/10. aaand those photo booth photos were simply gorgeous, you’re incredibly photogenic✨ anywho, i know there’s a 000000.01% that you’ll see this but thanks for being you🫱🏻‍🫲🏾💓
Literally she just make my day more fun ❤
"I need to try out" 🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃🏃
She is so iconic 🤪😫✨
Is this considered a vlog? I'm curious cause it's more cinematic
i wonder if emma drinks wine like she does coffee? 😂
I was never a really religious watcher of emma until she started this new style of content. now I watch her videos as soon as I see them
EMMA SLAYS ❤ EMMA IS MY IDOLLL😊
wtf where’s the tampon review?
🕊
need to know where she got those sunnies from if anyone has a clue!
I can’t explain the pure comfort i feel watching your videos 🤍
Thank you emma!!
it's crazy how emma has her whole life ahead of her, like she's only in her 20s
Emma back to school.
You know its going to be a good week when emma uploads
i love you sm emma❤️
you know you've made it in life when your in the background of one of emma's videos.
love you emma ❤️❤️❤️❤️
That was the best haul I have ever seen. Emma slays.
love you
😍😍😍😍
Why. Not. Just. Buy. More. Luggage?
I thought to tell if pants fit, you put your elbow in the waist, and you should be able to straighten your fingers to reach the other side.
Im dying I literally live in Jordaan Amsterdam how come I haven’t see Emma !!!!
Love episodes such a good shop. the butterfly shorts were so cute !
The editing on this was phenomenal, the music for the haul was perfection 🤌🏼 the fade out of the music from the haul to the boat on the bridge 10/10 escapism and cinematic enjoyment. You go, Emma 🫶🏼
Excellent job Michael! You filmed Emma exquisitely! You filmed the surroundings wonderfully!  Emma Loved seeing you on late night TV the other day.👍👍 You are so approachable in this video! It was almost like us viewers were there in the chair next to you.
Yep it’s called OB girl, 😂.
Wait….I want a chocolate pot 🥐!
The close up of you eating, was like a Fellini movie. And the scissors? To cut the tags off your new clothes.
This is by far one of my favorite video yet, you dancing made me so happy 🥹🥹🥹
Your dad style of filming is like he is trying to do a paint, like what he would paint, puts it on the screen
I love emma new style and these travel videos and its so sweet how she makes them with her dad
Why i love her dance so much.😂😂💃💃
me: a 29 year old straight male gym-rat yt: *new emma chamberlain video* me: sweet
12:12 Yall idk if I'm the only one but the timing was PERFECTTT
Meet up with this chick if still in Netherlands she’s an amazing person and you would enjoy her  https://youtube.com/c/GrizzlyTrueCrime
i just witnessed an emma chamberlain ad on an emma chamberlain youtube video
I am manifesting that hopefully I can travel different countries with my dad soon like Emma chamberlain 💕✨
i hope emma opens up her own vintage store with just her own clothes
i love you emma, the only consistent friend in my life <3
The pigeon socks reveal is kinda epic...even found the perfect pigeon sock tune.
i absolutely ADORE this side of emma. from watching her since 2015, and to see her as this beautiful blossoming young woman, is so amazing. i am so so so proud of her🥰
im loving these videos, they're so relaxing and the vibes... just perfect
even australia we dont use applicators
You are just too adorable. I’m from S.F. and started watching your vlogs when you were a wee lass taking day trips to the city with your friends. I feel like you haven’t changed the essence of who you were then.
Boring.
I will wait a year for your video,no problem. You put the rest of the bloggers to shame…I’m not into watching them clean,put on make up….etc
um excuse me madam you only need to push the elevator button once 🤣🤣🤣
Emma finally uploaded omg
Emma’s vlogs are like a peaceful fun temporary break from the chaos of life
what a fucking queen
miss u emma
... andddd she ate the bee-tomato soup
i loved that pair flirting
I love you and your videos you look so happy ❤️
the black jeans I think were maternity jeans lol
I love emmas vlogs when she visits different places. She shows the culture and the beautifulness of other places
loose tampons are more sustainable :) I’ve used OB’s in the states for years.
WHY ARE THESE VIDEOS LITERALLY SO PERFECT?!?! Thank you Emma, keep doing you
“i got wittle chocolate pwesents” that’s pure gold
Shoot, I thought we gonna watch her insert it.
at that point it is just a glorified cotton ball
dream video😭
great.. Now I want Pigeon socks and Stinky Cheese!! 🤣🤣 ILY EMMA xoxo !!
EC X MC 🤘
emma in her travel era>>
this is def my fav video from her adventures in europe. love the energy:)
Go to JAPAN
You can have an inordinate amount of clothes luv, why do you feel the need to buy more every chance you get?
Can we talk about that haul, by far my favorite thing she’s ever done hahahaha
🤍
i love these videos! so cute and fun and peaceful to watch. and the adorable couple that literally gave me butterflies at 11:50 🤭
i need to give emma a smooch on the lips, like at 12:12 I actually watched it 5 times cause it was too perfect how the music lined up to emma going through the jeans
Why don’t you just buy another suitcase but a large one ?😊
Coho fan? 😂
The haul 💀😂😂 the best Haha
One. The people watching clips in this video are perfect. Two. The music reminds me of Hey Arnold!
hello emma i love you so much 💗
that dog was moonwalking
Her sunglass is really cool! Who knows the name of it?
The way you press the elevator button <3 Missed you girl. Thank you for continuing to be different, vulnerable and natural. Keep sharing the nuances of life.
STOP GOING TO MY FAVORITE PLACES IM DYING
🎆Emma dancing🎆
this is the life. THIS IS THE LIFE
Today’s been a weird & isolated birthday, and this is literally the best gift I’ve received. Thank you Emma, you always make everything better without even know it.
the amount of happiness i felt when the bee was saved from the soup
Michael Chamberlain is an amazing videographer, bravo
I love you emma❤️
hun was high the whole video and i love that for her
Well deserved credits.
From reading the comments i learned her dad's the one recording... No wonder she wasn't flashing traffic :)
lessgooo
16:20 now thats a painting! a business man on a bike.
Emma I love you so much, you're amazing
Jesus loves you
Any Colleen Hoover fans got the “is that a fucking pigeon”
The haul segment of this video has made the rest of my day,month and year
why is no one talking about the bee that landed in her soup lol
love u emba
You are part of my morning routine ♡ What a great start of the day!
Emma I was watching your video and your own ad came up, I hope I succeed in life as much as you do
I loved this I love you emma
11:54 why is this so cute omg
After the movie The Fault in our Stars, Ive been dying to come to Amsterdam!!!
HELP the way ive never laughed so hard at emmas video
The second fit was firee
When I lived in Iceland it was weird to me too about tampons.. but now I don't even buy the plastic ones
<3
love her!!!!!!!!!!!
I love you!❤
love her!!!!!!!!!!!
Is that a fucking pidgin  Remainders of him
love seeing all the things she talks about in her podcasts in her videos
vibes are immaculate
I love her so much. Watching her videos is like watching a comfort show 😭😭
what the hell bro I only use loose tampons
I love your videos! 🫶🏼
I'm convinced she is going to explore the entire of Europe before she goes back to LA.
gold
The haul reminds me so much of Vic, gering ready for her first party in the movie “La Boom”
I told everyone to shut up because Emma posted a new video. I love this comfort content
I love being Australian, we don’t have applicators
The music as you flipped through the jeans was so satisfying! Thank you for the bit of beauty you always add to the world!
The elevator button clip 😂😭
No fucking way the Beatles shirt I NEED IT
your dad and you make a killer combo. I love these vlogs. I loved the older ones too but I love that you're always evolving.
It feels like watching a movie
I'm actually from The Netherlands and for some reason it feels so meta to see Emma walking into an Albert Heijn grocery store... that must sound so stupid but AAGH HOW COOL :DDD
<33
I love how her editing style has her personality all over it
emma having her own ad playing in the middle of her amazing vid of her traveling Europe for a month is probs the biggest flex of all time
Oh to be Emma chamberlain eating a chocolate croissant in Amsterdam and looking up tampons
emma just started a pigeon trend
i wish we were there at the same time i was there over the summer!!!
There's no way my waist is the size of my neck.
emma's editing skills are off the charts the vid is sooo well done .
i feel like i am watching the female version of rick steves
breathingtaking as always, miss chamberlain
No applicators in Australia, girl!
dying inside knowing i was there and i didn’t bump into her 🥲
I love ob tampons I never use the ones with the applicator anymore
If anyone needs a stunning composition- Michael Chamberlain is the man. You needed the scissors to cut the labels out of your clothes.
obsessed with the new style of videos but also the haul and the dancing felt like a throwback to old videos 🥹
12:12 can we just take a sec to appreciate how the background music was on beat with emma going through the jeans? absolutely loving and living for Emma's editing
omg what crack do european photo booths have that we are missing over here omg
Waking up and seeing an Emma Chamberlain new video is like waking up Christmas morning <3
Y’all got any loose tampons
We love the cinematographer 🫶🏼
I want to know where you procured that blue sweater...
Emma you need to go to BERLIN  honest to God
LUVV
baby girl is a travel channel now
Sometimes I forget how new Emma is. It's a bit nostalgic watching her experience the world. Ah to be young...!
The dancing haul reminded me of Emma’s old videos but in a new, elevated way. We love you Emma!
okay but 0:26, if emma had her own show.
te amo
Mmmm loving the choice of music in this video
Be careful of toxic shock syndrome
Emma doing her old little dances, shut the fuck yo 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
how these glasses are called ?
Love this. Best youtuber on the planet
I just love anything and everything you post. Props to Samantha Jo for turning me on to your vids! I've been watching a couple years now. THANKS for being so down to earth and wonderful.
te amo
Omg take me back to Amsterdam
These videos remind me of travel shows but like on pbs, and I love that <3
Oh my God, the photos! Like a silent movie actress. I love that the city feels quiet during the day but comes alive at night.
tampons without applicators are common everywhere but the usa, here in brasil i’ve never even seen one with the applicator 😅
oh lookie Emma’s back with another banger 😍
Literally was talking about going to Amsterdam and wanted to find some cool videos about the area and then this gets posted today!!!   Emma you've outdone yourself, thanks babe
Omg, when the elevator opened… Emma please 😂😂
THE DANCE MONTAGE HAS ME ROLLING
there is something so strange yet so comforting about seeing you walk through the exact supermarket i go to on a weekly basis
Emma's vlogsss always make me feel much better🥺🥺🥺🤍
why did it end
There’s something so comforting about these videos. Love them so much
W cop on all the sunnies but L for not copping tose black and white pointed loafers
i love her so much i am literally going to cry
this laid back goofy energy is everything I needed ily emma
The way these vlogs are shot and edited are just really cool. I recently discovered and binged Emma’s videos so seeing the evolution is just great ❤
I love this videos
emma is seattle as a person
the edit, the hall, the dances... i love you emma thank you
EMMA KEEP THE SHORT BLONDE HAIR FOREVER it’s suits you so well !!!

My favorite person
Emma's video free therapy
The haul montage is everything
now i want to visit amsterdam
the haul montage was too good
your videos are like a breath of fresh air
Best one👍 the haul was the best
Drink every time Emma says ‘know what I mean’ cheers y’all 🎉😂
I NEED to know where your jeans are from. We have similar body types and I’ve never seen jeans so flattering in my life.
Love her dances I can’t ❤️😂
ia that a fucking piegon  collen hoover readers will know
I LOVE YOUUUUU💗💗
I love her but WHY DID SHE CUT THE CHEESE LIKE THAT ???
:) i love u
Hahaha I just told my friends about the tampon situation in NL last week🤣 same here and it’s so tiny I just worried it would lose it’s way down there
the music during the haul was everything
I LOVE YOU
i really enjoyed this tampon vlog and the pigeon socks 🤣
No bc I’ve been in the exact spot as the thumbnail 😭😭
I don't know how to put it in simpler terms but I love her
I LOVE YOU EMMA
I've said this before, and ill say it again. If you need an applicator to put in a tampon, you will never survive the apocalypse. Sorry Emma
The “what’s a loose tampon” took me out 😭😭
my aunt lives there and she’s sent me so much photos and this was so much fun to watch! i’m so glad you’re back
IM EARLY
Emma made my day❤️
these videos are my biggest comfort
this content is so next level
the man with the paintings was so cute
I love Emma so much and her dad!!!!
chocolate is so good over there. 9:42
she is so inspiring no matter what happens to her, she just lives like a regular person.
I seriously love her 😭😭
I love how she walked pass my job and uni and I never saw her 👍
emma i don’t want to alarm you but there’s a dog behind you and it’s moonwalking
ilysm
I like when Emma says we have to do a haul part which makes me feel this is so EMMA
Asik juga bisa mengunjungi negara-negara yg berbeda, seperti kehidupan yang diinginkan para youtuber pada umumnya. Melihat emma enjoy her life by herself membuat b berpikir bahwa jalan2 dan menikmati keindahan dunia harusnya tidak ribet.
The beginning was not Amsterdam, but Haarlem! I could’ve met her..😓
The haul music was so fun!
also the try on haul was the best part haha love the dance moves queen!!
I hate the last song because it means bye 😭😭😭
how does her dad not crack the fuck up while filming
This is the first time I've noticed her tattoos
Your  videos always put a smile on my face😊👍
I can’t explain this but this vlog style makes me feel like I’m watching a british documentary from the 2000s
you have no idea how much I've missed a haul from the one and only Emma Chamberlain
this is everything
I admire you so much emma, ur videos feel like we are on facetime <3 u are my comfort youtuber, please continue being you! your amazing!! LOVING THIS CONTENT
Loveyou! Make a vlog trip in greece
I clicked so fast when I saw Amsterdam. The first camera shots….. is the city Haarlem hahahahaha. I live there ;p
bee soup
as a dutchie. i love this.
AAAAA THIS IS THE NEXT BEST THING TO BEING THERE THANK YOU EMMA FOR AN AWESOME VIDEO! Also, the intro music and intro was just MWAH and the thrifting part with the pant skipping with the music
Your videos relax me so much from doing college work 🥲 I love you Emma!!
13:36 somehow managed to piss me off 😔
why are Americans always confused by our tampons hahahaha just use your finger.
She makes life look so great adventurous and fun.
At 4:40  Timothée Chalamet resemblance
That man selling his paintings though.. people like that break my heart with so much fuzzy feelings
The clip at 11:52 has the be one of the cutest things ever
Nice mom jeans
Can we please be friends
I just don’t think I could live without your videos
“I don’t know why but I do” 🫶🏻
Is this like european tour emma?  Im loving it
The quality of these videos Emma come on! Immaculate vibes.
emma in europe = her petting random animals
Who is your camera person? Your dad? I thought I saw him at the table at the cafe.   Ok Never mind. I saw the credits.
can we talk about the adorable moment caught of the two strangers on the street they were so cute
I really missed your energy Emma,  i’m so glad you’re back❤️
🍫 🫐 🧀 🥖 🐝 🧦 🐦
gleeked lmao !
I love you so much ‘
Did the crossiant  have weed in it?
I feel like I'm there with her everytime I watch her videos. I love the way she captures everything😭💗
17:10    ngl good
Girl te falta Switzerland
I know she is with her dad but I love how she is giving us the perspective of being alone with yourself and learning to enjoy your own company.
were the socks a colleen hoover reference??
my dad literally just came back from his holiday from there and he sent me pics of the socks HE DIDNT SHOW ME THE PIGEON SOCKS 😾😾😾😾😾
Oh my god this was in Amsterdam? There was this one place with a river that i always wanted to visit!
The tampon thing is so funny. Yes, in europe we dont use those plastic applicators, it's more eco friendly anyways
LOVEDDDDD THIS VIDD
hi i love you
You look like timothé chalamet
This has gotta be my favourite travel video yet. You can just tell how much fun she had making this 😍
Empty content
0:13 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Emma come to Spain please
Never used or seen a tampon applicator here in australia, seems very unnecessary.
I saw my dad with a woman who is not my mum in one of those clips
wait. could you not have bought a new carry on rather than ship everything home? you weren't there for a long while either so you probably would have arrived back before the clothes did😭
Emma, I love first how your dad is creating the videos and second how your editing the videos it’s honestly so good! Also those outfits and I was talking to you when you were asking about the socks so I’m glad you got both lol
When I watch your video I feel so relaxed
The dancing and music I’m dead 💀😂
That's a normal tampon I'm so confused, what's an applicator for a tampon? Just use your finger
Love that you are backkkkk!!! Missed you
It’s amazing how calm and chill your vlog made Amsterdam seem😳 if you’ve ever been there you’ll know how freaking chaotic this town really is😂 loved the vlog and especially the editing on this one Emma!!
I loved this vid sm you have no idea how exited I got when I got the notification that u uploaded
God she’s just the coolest person ever
this camerawork is extrodinary
I'm just shocked Emma u look so damn beautiful the fuck
i love your traveling vids but i miss your vids at home
THE DANCE BREAK 😭😭
gorgeous video! missed you!
Imagine just walking along the canals of Amsterdam and seeing Emma walk by and getting the chance to be in her video 😂😂
it’s the way i can just listen to her talk and it’s so calming
Come to Australia and try our coffee.  Coffee shop at every corner, the most delicious coffee you’ll ever drink
I have never felt as much terror as when Emma cut the cheese the way she did. What was that
I live in Haarlem and I was so so upset that you visited while I was away on vacation!! I hope you had the best time <3
seeing clips of Amsterdam makes me realize how ugly so many American cities are lol I need to move!!
I love how many of these shots you have to wait for to get— like the train. It impacts the pacing dramatically.
I was actually missing you today, friend!
Emma’s videos are the most relaxing, peaceful art pieces of everyday life that have blessed YouTube 🥹☺️
epic
she's living her best life I'm so happy for her
this is making me depressed because i couldve met emma chamberlaine but my lame ass decided to go back to school shopping smh
i dont undestand why enasted of shipping your cloth home, you didnt buy another courage
emma is so comforting
This video brought me so much joy !!!! I loved watching Emma do a haul and being her goofy self ! So nostalgic 💕
girl u need a kaasschaaf
This is so far my favorite of the "24 hours in ___" little series. I love how Emma's editing and her dad's recordings mesh to create vlogs remniscent to films, and how much her style has blossomed over the last few years 🌷
How can someone do so much talking but yet say so little at the same time. I've never heard someone talk so much nonsense in my life honestly. Video was painfully boring and completely pointless (literally pointless, like what was the purpose of this?!) Good gawd 🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
Love watching these travelling with emma vlogs 😎✨ She’s an icon and a LEGEND
11:54 tell me she didn't ask for that guys number
please tell me you bought a painting from this older gentleman, he seemed precious. also another great vlog <3
Omg you were hereeeee in my country😩😍🫶🏽😭
Really nice seeing you go around in my country :) captured the atmosphere very well. Would love to see more of you in other European cities!
Please do a feature film
youre living the lifeeee Emma ;)))xx
I love you Emma but damn shipping back home your clothes by plane or boat and then buying new stuff again and again you need to think about planet and global worming 💚🌎🌱 please plus you’ve so much influence, show us the right way to do this thx
European tampons be different🤣
beautiful 🫶🏽🫶🏽
I love how Emma's videos are so therapeutic for me I thoroughly enjoy her.
How is mommy chamberlain doing?
Love you Emma! From Japan🇯🇵 You are a very special person to make a lot of people happy. Please keep taking care of yourself and please be happy too. xoxo
I love how they know when to put some background sound a little bit in your videos and when to quiet it down so we can focus more with your storytelling. Its calming. 😩
HAARLEMMM
emma in my country is just the best thing EVER AAAAA
I need more vlogs please😩💞
When Emma posts.you.drop.everything.
I can't even eat it now...proceeds to eat
The Coffeshop tip was great to know about. I could imagine me going to town on a pastry without even knowing
The music synced with flipping through the jeanssss
Yayyyy! I’ve miss you on YouTube!! Emma you’re back!!! 💕💕💕💕💕💕
The editing and cinematography on this video was fantastic. Made me feel like I was watching an indie documentary about travel
She is the greatest thing alive
That haul edit was the best thing I've seen in my life.
I swear she is the coolest person
THE HAUL EDITING HAHAHAHA
Seeing the old man painting made me tear up 😭
11:53 favorite part
Now my day got even better. 🖤
Not enough comments about the widdle chocowate pwesents
Emma did u eat a chocolate croissant that takes u to another dimension
That little moment when she was sifting through the jeans to the tune of the song was nothing short of cinematic
Keep track of your cycle, ladies, and remember not to drink the night before your Aunt Flo visits.  It can be disastrous.
Your dad dies amazing doing your videos 👍🛍
watching emma's videos is like asmr to me
I just wanna be there with her
God sent His one and only Son to come die on the cross for us.He took that punishment that we deserve so u can have eternal life
You know what's great about being an only child? Is your parents knew right off the bat that one was plenty 😇
love you
This might be one of my fave videos of Emma’s so far
Emma chamberlain had posted and now my life makes sense again 🙃
her videos just get better every time
Why is Emma always in a rush with elevators?
emma’s living the life I always wanted.
Go to Bruges or Ghent next: you can find the best waffles and chocolate (and fries) in Belgium!
God I adore this woman
MY HOME CITY OMG
I never met a YouTuber that is so engaging, I love you  and the video is that 10 mins yesssss!
i loved this video
this is for far the best video of emma that i ever seen
12:49 WHY DID YOU CUT IT LIKE THAT AAAA
I just got a honey ad with Emma🤣🤣
the tampon part took me out because it’s so normal to not have an applicator with it, for us
Anyone else catch the “is that a fucking pigeon” reference from Colleen Hoover 👀👀👀
Is Emma the travel channel now?
2:28 maybe they thought u was so small you have a tiny virgina? maybe that is the size of European virginas and we are just wide set virgina Americans?
Please never stop giving us vlogs from europe. You make me so happy it’s insane
Love you Emma! 💕
I'm here after steph pappas video because I needed to cheer up💔
@ 8:35 GOT TO SEARCH THAT UP NOWW : SCISSORS ALLOWED ON CARRY ON!!!!!!
The Dutch fashion is made for girls ur size
I lol 😂 a crime scene omgosh. When I tried tampons for the 1st time, it took me about 7 tries to get it right. Love 💕 you Emma. Have a coffee shop on me 😉
cannot emphasise enough how much we appreciate the creativity and love that has gone into this video, it hits ❤☺
So glad I got to see you on the streets!!!!
Chamberlain vibes
You living in the amsterdam for a while :)
@ 15:32 EMMA SERVING US TIKTOK CONTENT  TRYING OUTFITSSS !!!!!!
het laatste dat ik me ooit zou kunnen bedenken is dat emma fucking chamberlain bij een albert heijn zelfscan zou staan
I LOVE THISSS
Erm no they don't say "what kind of marijuana do you want" at all, stop the lying! They wait for you to place your order (y'know... like a normal place of business would). Please don't start being a liar there's already too many liars on yt you're better than that. Do better! Stop the cappery!
Loved the haul !
god emma i love you so much
Be careful with the COFFESHOPS 😂😂😂
JAAAA EINDELIJK!!! i was hoping & waiting we would get an amsterdam version <3 it brings me so much joy to see my own city through your perspective!! i wish i could've met you, manifesting that i will one day <3
naurr not episode 😭 they just get fila or whatever other overpriced brand and crop them too short and sell em for like €28
I love that her dad films her videos and those paintings by that old man🥺
serious question::: where's her music coming from do you think
Imagine seeing yourself walking in this video
Absolutely obsessed with this new editing style
World traveler just hitting all the spots.
LOVING THE ENERGY <3333
the part where the flipping of the jeans matched with the music was SO GOOD
Emma is back and, off course, hilarity ensues: “What’s a “loose” tampon?”, she asked. 😂 Sharp! We love it, Emma.  Can’t wait for more “Emmaisms”.
love the new emma… but i miss my forehead kisses.
11:10 wait go back to what you just said..
Emma would easily fit in in Amsterdam
11:05 SO GOOD
I feel like these 24 hours in ________ location videos are the content we didn't know we needed, but they are really brilliant, thank you so much
I can’t get over how cheap the pads and tampons are. They’re literally only 1-2 dollars there (I converted) like they’re 9-11 dollars in the US. That’s fucking crazy.
BE HONEST. Is it weird?   I’m 30 and I work A LOT and these videos make me happy?! Might be because she is travel like I would like too but I just love her energy and she cracks me up! My friends think I am a creep because I watch the videos but I just watch them because she is funny, entertaining and living a cool life!
YESSSS OMG I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!! IM FROM THE NETHERLANDS
The sound effect when scrolling in the jeans was just my favorite part of this whole video
So happy when I saw this pop up as first on my recommended this morning:)
The way I drop everything to watch her new videos😭😭
Ohhhhyea I had been waiting for this
I love her sm
the haul part was amazing
8:43 BUSTED OUT LAUGHING AT THAT INTERACTION ILYSM
i love an aged gouda. my bf brought me a super special aged gouda and was like “boy do i have something fun for u!!”
i love you
ağlıcam
I LOVE EMMA A LOT SHE REALLY SAVED ME FROM MY DEPRESSION
Emma being open about drinking is so weird
You made me fall in love with the city where I live again <3
COME BACK
I love her dad’s videography style, it’s so peaceful yet he throws in just enough chaotic energy to match emma’s 😂🫶
Somebody know where here sunglasses are from?
These travel vlogs let the viewer see absolutely nothing about the place where you are. Love it.
12:12 the music fits this so perfectly and it’s so funny
These videos are turning into Stanley Kubrick-esque productions and I am here for it.
The chaotic energy mixed in with calm shots of the environment is everything
Such a great content creator.  She looks awesome as well.
Speaking from a traumatic experience when I was 5 no you can not take scissors on carry on.. they took my favourite pair away from me
The dog at 2:05 slowly getting dragged offscreen
Can't imagine you just 4 hours away from me 😭
I love her 😍
The way that dog just started moon walking
Is that a fucking penguin DAMN EMMA DID YOU READ reminders of him by colleen hoover BABE?????????????
I’ve been binge watching her vids for the past 4 days, I think I’ve manifested this video
I fucking love her videos
i love watch her shop
How she can manage to look absolutely stunning in a tshirt and jeans will always amaze me
I feel like I’m there , it’s magical
Someone please put her in a Wes Anderson movie. Emma fits the vibes 🤌🏼
Yes to the dance moves and that Beatles top!
Emma you need to move to Berlin! :)
Hi love you
What a gorgeous human being ❤️
Not one person is curious who she is traveling with?????? 😳😳😳. Me.  I am.
this is art
The amount of times I was listening to your podcast being in that same supermarket checkout.
She is too damn cute
“last night i had a lot of wine. you know what i mean?” yes ms emma i think i do. i think i do.
heel casual in de appie
Come to rotterdam!
The editing is beautiful
As a gal who grew up in California, living in Europe for 10 years now has definitely made me a bit closer with my body than one might need to be when it comes to my period :'D The occasional tampon you find with an applicator, the stick to push wont be long enough to actually push the whole tampon out of the applicator and you end up having to wiggle it out anyways. This is why I have switched to a menstrual cup. If I have to get to know my vagina that up close and personal every month, might as well do it in comfort and only once or twice a day instead of several times ^-^
I'm not sure if she is lying about coffee shop and cafe 😂
12:37 coffee smiley
good job yall
I just loveee u ❤
Your vibes..❤️
Hello..
i love seeing the people i love in places i recognize
Emma is giving me Tony Stark vibes with those sunglasses.
this is therapy.
Love these new videos ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh😤😳🥵🤤
The haul had me dying 😂😂
Hi Emma, your editing is becoming more and more excellent : ] the choices of background music match very well. Emma's Dad, your filming look very professionally framed and captured. Can't believe such awesome quality comes from a simple CX405 camcorder!!!  Emma, we come from different generations and backgrounds, but I really appreciate your videos and podcast topics.
These videos literally make my whole day so much better. :)
i think it’s absolutely precious how you & your dad have started collaborating on these videos! its like his paintings and your content have become one beautiful masterpiece
im going to be thinking about loose tampons for the rest of the day now
The pigeon socks 😩💖
They sell those tampons in the US lol my mother and sister in law use that brand 🤣
I feel like we're traveling with you, Emma, and it's truly a pleasure and a privilege!  Thanks for sharing a little bit more of this world for those who've never been.  It's lovely. <3
I really like Emma's new editing style... Especially the sounds it's ears and eyes blessing fr 🫶🏻
Omg how much I've missed the haul dancing!
Emma: Who did this? Emma:  It was me (granola)
Dad is a cinematic genius.
It’s rly cool to see how awesome this videos are, they are like 10 min cinematic stories and adventures. Perfect.
that dog moon walking as she is talking about drinking too much wine lol
imagine just casually being in emma's broll
That's my country ✊✊✊
HAARLEM my hometown yeeee
I wanna be emma when I grow up
the scenes are sooooo fk good❤
Are u telling me that u ve just purchased the most crazy the beatles shirt(the band that I m deeply in love with since I have learnt how to hear) only the couple of days after I HAD LEFT Amsterdam... this is insane. At this point I need some kind of recompensation.  Can't accept the fact though I missed the chance to literally meet u :c Hope you visit more European cities. Also I must admit Emma that you re like a butter to our souls and we truly love our therapist. Glad seeing you happy. sending hugs and forehead kisses <3
omg the butterfly shorts - NEED
im so happy that u were an hour away from me, the idea is amazing
I love how the bee lands in her soup and her dad's saves her from the bee!
masterpiece
i love u
thank you for lining up the music with the jeans that was phenomenal
We are here for this! Yes
earlier i was thinking it felt like an emma chamberlain new-video day today… and i was indeed correct!!!
Black and withe photos of her made her look like she was from a Tim Burton's movie 🎥🍿
tampons with applicators sound SO weird to me being from europe like why would u.. but i get the confusion
Maybe speak more about the country or city you are in?
Just love this, it’s so calming to watch and it always makes my day!! And the credits was just amazing
we can see ur genuinely happy, love that
Love you Emma
Awesome video as usual. Plus where else are you gonna see a dog moonwalking other than in an Emma Chamberlain video
one of the most dutch things was when she brought her own bread and cheese to a café and than she fucked up by cutting the cheese like that🥴
I know it's like a low-tech cool editing thing where the audio from the previous clip plays in the next, but it's too fancy for an Emma vlog for me
i feel like your style was made for amsterdam
This was so relaxing
I wanna see emma either direct a movie or act in a romcom
the editing is just 10/10 , a gr8 day today! VIDEO + PODCAST EPISODE YES
every time I watch one of her videos it’s like I’m transported into another world
I studied in Amsterdam for three years, it feels surreal to see you walk around in a place that is so familliar to me. I hope you had a wonderful time, love from the Netherlands!
the fact that i had a commercial with emma chamberlain on emma chamberlain's video...
wish emma's videos never end
In Australia you only learn how to use normal tampons.... none of this applicator crap ahhahah
I’m watching it while drunk out of my mind on vacation in Croatia. having so much fun
and that's why i never complained when she took brakes... whenever emma comes back to yt, her videos are always better than the ones before. I mean, what a legend
Those credits were the highlight of my day
ooo noooo not the ob tampons they are like tampons you get in school when you're in sex ed classe for the first time. worst ones!!!nn tip for other people traveling to the belgium and the netherlands tampax pearl tampons the best
u should visit finland next!
You ladies know what I'm talking about .. Me a boy : 🧍🏻‍♂️
Lysm xxx
12:13
The perfect matching at 12:13
Here for the dancing try-on montage
tampons with applicators are considered too much waste in most of Europe. we call the ones with applicators by the brand name tampax.
Please next time let me give you a tour 🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Emma is the BFF I've always wanted. ❤️
I wish i knew!!! I live in the netherlands
14:31 EMMA IS THAT A REMINDERS OF HIM REFERENCE
my favorite city on the planet, shes hitting all the best spots!
Girl so sad I missed you in amsterdam its litterally so close to my home🥲
hi emma i hope ur living ur best life❤ we love u
emma you are my comfort person and you have been since 2017. love you so much
Michael!!!!
we were friends in a past life
I feel like I’m watching YouTube premium. It’s like I’m traveling with you . If your reading this Your videos makes my mental state better ! I feel so calm watching your videos🥰Greetings from Germany:)   Sorry for my bad English :)
She's so genuine I wanna hug her!
holland is my second home, and seeing Emma go to an Albert hein brought me so much joy for no reason!
Your dad is so cool
The Chamberlains doing an amazing job. This is beautiful.
Love these videos! So relaxing to watch.
Bruh how long have you been gone for that your clothes smell like the mcdonalds drive thru 💀😂 Glad you're back with another video! Best video I have watched in awhile. For real!
u always slay emma..❤️
she makes me feel so happy  💌
we’re officially in 24 hours emma era
Emma I look forward to these 😋
Pleeeeeeease give props to your dad!!! Amazing camera men!!!!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 and the editing is pure 🔥 🔥 👌 😍 💯
this video was so calming. Also that haul was hilarious 🤣
Emma makes my life better omg
Weet iemand waar die man zit te schilderen in amsterdam?
i need a fucking playlist made by you
i miss the old her tbh...
After watching her older vlogs it just feels right seeing her blonde
Shes probably not in amsterdam anymore, i didn’t know she was here!!!
you make my day
Literally so amazing seeing Emma in my city, like a saw some spots in ur video of places I was today, which is mind blowing to me
THE EDITING ON THIS ONE IS JUST FANTASTIC.
I still get so excited for her videos, i love them so much i cant
did you know that more pigeons won medals in WW2 than dogs? they’re highly intelligent and we domesticated the fuck out of them. it’s actually super sad bc they’re really social and after the war they basically were just left to the wild/cities but they’re so domesticated still so it would be like just leaving an entire population of dogs or cats to the streets :(
I love European Emma
We missed you so much
Emma filmed my house and I didn’t notice 🤓😫
emma in de appie letsgo
Brillo pads again but you look like Moira Hindley ,the moors murderer in those snaps.
As a Dutch person this feels most relatable Emma’s videos have felt so far
Are we just not gonna talk about that dog that randomly moonwalked of the screen 😦
These are awesome. It’s like she’s taking us on the trip with her. Such an experience!
my kinda coffee shop
you really feel like my bestfriend;) thank you for that:)
Go Sweden next time!!🤩
THOSE SUNGLASSES. please someone tell me where they are from.
Emma, these are the tampons we use in Europe :D what a shocker
comfort person
As a dutch person, I found it remarkable how you captured the real essence of the dutch cities and how they typically look in your fragments. Great video! P.s. I just know that the more busy areas of Amsterdam just reeked like weed.
post more POST MORE
as a long time fan, I'm so happy to see you're out living your life instead of just staying in LA trying to make content there. This traveling content from you is what I live for. I hope you're happier Emma (:
You need to try cheese from são jorge island in the azores. Is 1 of the best cheeses in the world with many international awards. So you need to visit Portugal.
Your videos always refresh me!
you always makin me smile girlie <3
Fascinating that we are about the same age but she looks 19 and 39 at the same time and that's a peculiarity I really love about her.
Emma you should’ve went to Rotterdam, it’s better lol
I'm so happy for Emma that she has worked so hard her whole life and now she gets to relax and travel to whatever country she wants to! Millennials, this should be an example to your work ethic! GO TO WORK!
Traveling the world and documenting it.  THAT SHOULD BE ME, Justin Bieber
👏
Emma’s videos bring me so much joy, she was my favorite YouTuber 3 years ago and she’s my favorite now. I genuinely love her so much. She also kind of made pigeons my favorite animal too.
I haven't been shopping in Amsterdam in since before corona and this is making me want to go again soon! It's only like 1.5 hours by train from my house.  There are a few speciality shops that are just great.
Dutch be like.. "What's an applicator?"
ive been binging ur old videos recently and when i saw the notification i was filled with warm  coffee joy.. ilysm❤
Great video.
Went to Amsterdam a couple years ago. I think 24 to 48 hours is enough to see it lol.  I stayed for a week and got bored by the end of the trip.
I see those adidas...Kanye out, Emma in. Just imagine what Instagram would look like-ala Taylor Swift all over again 👀
it is always so exciting to see these videos 😭
Loose tampons are the best, better for the environment and easier to carry around
Tell me why I knew she would get pigeon socks without even knowing there’d be pigeon socks there.. 😂
the visuals are amazing
I wonder if she ever travels with her mom
she is genuily amazing
the haul part reminded me of joanna ceddia and i miss her😭
omg you're back !
Does anybody know what type of jeans she is wearing (the light blue one?)
Just gonna leave us hanging about those scissors…
I was literally so excited when I saw that you uploaded a new video Emma. I’m loving the new cinematic editing style. It felt as if I was hanging out with a friend but I was also watching a short indie film. You really have a gift. The way how you shoot footage and put it together is amazing and the pacing was extraordinary. I love your videos, can’t wait for the next upload
That was so beautiful <3 <3
Thank u
The st peppers lonely hearts club band shirt 😭😭i need it
day = made
your videos lke a therapy to me
now i can say i've been to Amsterdam
💙
Buy an extra suitcase because it is waaasyyyy cheaper then postage.  There is a good chance that when you get home you'll have to pay taxes on the package of your clothes  to receive them.
just in time, thank you
serotonin boost
This is.... not like regular Emma. It’s watered down and self conscious.. the edit is terrible, music too loud... what happened? Feels forced somehow and mechanical :(
emma hear me out youre amazing and i love you
I love that she travels with her dad
I wish Emma was just filming herself. Feels less personal with her dad behind the camera. Doesn’t calm my anxiety at all like the ones where she’s alone. but I’m happy she’s happy.
i really needed this
Wtf tampons come with applicators in America?! Xo a Dutchie
Hey, Emma ! I love you. Bye.
You gotta get some freshly squeezed juice if you’re in Holland
those dance moves oh my gawwwwd
13:00 had me cryinnggg
I don’t understand why she can’t buy extra luggage
GAAHHH EMMA I LOVE YOU
MISS U SM U WERE SO SWEET HOPE TO SEE U BACK SOON
Why is This the most comforting thing in the world, your the best Emma ❤️
ive put way to many unnecessary comments under this vid
shout out to the bee
I need to try eh.....whatever  I have to change asap!!! I get that soo well
how tf do u cut ur cheese
also the cinematography is amazing
I wanna go thrift shopping with u emmaaaa
Watching your videos is like therapy ❤️ (come to Valencia, Spain. It is really beautiful)
Am I the only one who thinks Emma’s dad is secretly behind the camera😅
Will you talk about your Venice experience in your podcast??
Highlight of my week! 😭
I love you , thnx for the content that you give us. 🤍🤍🤍
something nostalgic abt emma’s dancing try on hauls & i’m always so here for it
2:03 can't stop laughing at the way the dog is being pulled back
Loving these traveling videos ! so well put together emma 🤍
fashion but make it fashian
Loved the haul
Love ya❤️
The hotel security watching the try on haul: 👁️👄👁️
the way you butchered that cheese … as a dutch person im so hurt rn!!
Absolutely loved meeting you it’s my favorite moment ever!! Don’t forget to invite Harry to our next oarty
12:13 the sincro with the song
the fact that I arrived in ams the day you left will haunt me forever :)
can someone link me to the shoes emma is wearing???????
felt like a safe space
words can’t describe how much i love this girl
Can you please mail me some of those chocolate croissants from the Coffee Shop that sends you to another dimension? Lol
emma living the rory gilmore europe trip trying out new cafes in her cropped jumper booty cargo fashion and her bf is touring this is such a big emma slay !! 🤍
Pump up the jam pump it up
happy to have you in my life  this video saved me
Would love to know where the black and yellow glasses are from - love!
she's never gonna finish that granola
I hope you enjoyed Amsterdam! ❤️‍🩹 i love you
in love
IM SO PROUD OF YOU EMMIE
emmaaa that sargeant pepper shirt is so good
Love this Emma! You seem SO happy!
in love with these vids
It's just nice to see her eat something other than veg and fruit tbh
Bro that’s where I live!!!
Can someone please tell me where the Jeanshorts are from??? 😫
hi
That bee was so rude it didn’t even ask before taking your soup 🙄💀
I love your tampon culture shock
I loooove the editing of the haul part! Bravo :))
Don't put your food directly on the bag it came in. You have no idea what and/or who all has touched that bag 🤮
Does anyone know the model of glasses ?
That dance montage was so epic
is it just me or are the new Emma vlogs literally like mini Wes Anderson movies. love love love!
niet emma die naar de appie gaat 😭
I laughed so hard about the „loose tampon“😂 that‘s normal here in europe. Welcome in europe emma!❤️✨
go to belgium for chocolate though
12:12 this is so good and satisfying
the haul is just wowowow
Amazing intro music
This vlog is everything
Thank you for posting Emma you don’t understand how much this makes me happy. I’ve been having a really hard time lately and you posting just brightens up my day 🥰
This is how my dad always films me just following me around just for memories between family and I felt like I’m watching myself rn 🤣
that jean paul gaultier was good queenie
Don’t know why but Nothing beats buying essentials at a European supermaket whilst on holiday… gives me a warm fuzzy feeling seeing Emma do it
Yo that had to have been the best haul I’ve ever seen
I remember seeing a packaged tampon in some random American movie for the first time 😅 I was like "what is that, why the hell is it that long??!!" Turns out, Americans use applicators... NEVER seen that in my life here in Germany.
she once again managed to make my day.
Emma is now an official hollander. She thought a coffeeshop sold coffee. She shopped at appie (albert heijn), she ate nijntje chocolate, she went cheese shopping. AND SHE GOT PIGEON SOCKS
ILOVEYOU SO MUCH EMMA💗😭
Those socks are too good
beautiful and interesting as always
when your cat forgets to teach you about tampons. lmfao
You can make a depressed person instantly happy, Emma ! Thank you for always bringing smile to my face! Btw I loved your sunglasses
Where’s my forehead kiss ???? 🥺🥺🥺
The try on emma lmaooo
also im from the netherlands and i've never used a tampon with applicator it's just so uncommon here
Another visual masterpiece 👌🏼
Emma the next time you're there go to Time Machine you would love
10 min of happiness
Nice vlog but who gives a s*it about tampons, dear ...Your dad would be more interesting to watch in  this vlog , ya know what I mean.
I’m glad Emma found a store that enjoys pigeons half as much as she does
12:46 as a dutch person I'm gonna have to cancel you for the way you eat that cheese, you're supposed to use a kaasschaaf for that
Hi Emma 👉👈
who else likes the video before watching it cuz we know its gonna be gdd
Wait so how do you get your tampons in the US? 😳 (I‘m from Europe)
can someone please tell me what hotel she is staying in
I was just in Amsterdam and went to so many of these places, I loved getting to see all those places again on video!
WHERE HAVE U BEEN GIRL, we need your videos to live
emma just for you i'll watch ur ads <3
god this is great
the vibes and editing of this video😩😩
Amazing video :,) <3
You should totally visit Gdansk in Poland it’s beautiful city!!!
yoo you posted less goo
loved it bestie, live your best life
tampons like these are better option because are more sustainable
This is precious
Haul in the hall
11:54 This couple looks so cute. I need to know their history.
I love these videos drops! It really makes my day!
YEAH!!! 😀😃😁😊☺️🥰
EMMA IN DE APPIE
i have never used a tampon with an applicator, in europe you just get your hands dirty
Seeing you walk around with an Albert Heijn shopper is absolutely fantastic, my dutch heart is exploding ❤️
Amsterdam has my heartttttt 🥰❤️ my favourite European city
Now I have the choice, watch 17min of a video about Amsterdam....  Or just sleep cus I have to wakeup at 6am since my daily internship starts at 9am in Amsterdam 😂✨
Loose tampon... Killed me 😆😆😆 i went through this in Sweden. Uh-huh😆😆😆
this was hypnotizing
In the middle of this video a got a call that we actually got a apartment in Amsterdam (moving from a different country) and if that not a sign from the universe than I don’t know what is… and none of my friends known yet lol
If you like the chocolate in the nergerlands you need to try out belgian chocolate, it's even better
Emma, i love and appreciate you bub.
12:13 this part of the edit is so smoothh
this is illegally enjoyable this is illegally enjoyable this is illegally enjoyable!
✨✨✨You are the MOST EPIC person i know ✨✨✨, saludos de Chile emmita!!!!!!!!🇨🇱🇨🇱🇨🇱
Her recent videos feel like HGTV and I kind of love that
Baby Emma we all love you sm💞💞💞💞
The man painting, my heart!!
I just love that its just Emma and her Dad vibin out together
Dress pant leggings (with a stirrup!) are a staple of the older Irish ladies’ wardrobe.  Also dying at how chic Emma looks outside the cafe yet she’s talking about crime scene toilets 😂
the way i didnt want the vid to finish ugh
EMMMAAAAA YAYYY WE NEED THE COOKING VIDEOS BACK plsssss :))
Its cute that Emmas dad filmed this
Saw some shots of Haarlem too ❤️

I want to hear more about that chocolate croissant story emma lol
omg i have been in that sock store
We’ve missed you. Thank you for making my day! Take care Emma😊
Whenever I watch Emma's videos, it feels like I'm being there with her.. imagine just casually spending time with Emma in Amsterdam or anywhere else...<3
I‘m from Europe and for us it is totally normal that tampons don’t have applicators. And, by the way, o.b. is by far the best tampon brand… :)
the shot with the girl and the guy in front to the shop was beautiful
Imagine walking past her and not recognizing her 🥲
emma, ik this is like every comment you receive, but i love you so much. you got me through the worst and for that you will forever be in my heart.
Hi Emma I'm watching ur videos so long love ur dad he is being so helpful  love the content nd missing the personal vlog that u doo like silly and goofy 🤪🤣 missing ur paints and ur book reading scenes and i seriously as a og fan I'm missing ur kisses at the end 😢 double kisses hope u give them in next vlog .now it's like  so professional video I'm so missing ur cooking and i also miss the cats 😺😺 love u amma
I’m sick and was feeling pretty shit, didn’t feel like doing anything or watching anything just wanted to lay like a blob and cry, i only felt like watching your video and honestly great decision 10/10. Not in such a bad mood anymore :))
hahaha emma in de appie is a different kind of vibe
Emma new content is so claming love🤍🤍🤍💕
okay miss cinematography

Emma buy another suitcase
The dance 💃🏻 is the best
I think its so sweet that you have your dad come with you and film, hes doing a fantastic job! ♡
Okay but Emma during her little haul was the cutest 🥲
Wait what’s a tampong applicator? I’m not american never heard of that :o
I love you so much Emma you put a smile on my face I keep rewatching your videos all the time they even help me to sleep ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
RIP to the people who don't know her and met her 😩
Kinda early woooooo
Ahhhh this made me so happy!!! London is so sad this week, it’s so hard to be in. This video was a wonderful escape 😭
O:42  Well Emma? What get you get?
Genius - ship it 😊
Emma using her Albert Heijn bag to ship stuff back to America sends me
When I watch her videos I feel like I’m there with her, it’s just amazing, she’s amazing ♥️
GIRL.. WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR THAT SGT PEPPER SHIRT , I WILL GIVE YOU A PIGEON .
Can someone tell me what Levis style her jeans are
Why not buy an extra suitcase?
Yesss so happy to see Emma has posted a new video!! The only celebrity I would call my idol and i dont even care if thats cringe 💖
EMMA WE MISSES YOU
Ya bu olkeye gitmeyi coooooook istiyorum mup bir ulke en buyuk hayalimmm
Girlie why didn’t you just buy a second suitcase to check instead of shipping everything
Why does she give me major “Samantha brown passport to Europe” vibes 😭😭 I love it sm
I love ❤️ the travel 🧳 content!
the way emma cut that cheese hurts my dutch heart
She Wears Pants ❤
Comfort human, I love you Emma.
OH MY GOD Emma ILY I can't describe how happy I am now just bcs u posted a new video sweetheart
Best haul eva.
OMYGODDD!!!! MY COUNTRY 💕
10/10 relaxing thank u
Just Emma out here livin her best life traveling the world...... 💯💯❤️❤️❤️
Would it not be easier to buy and ship the things she's bought home? That way she can get cute stuff from each place she visits idk
We just use our finger to apply the tampon
I literally love her sm
When she said “is that a pigeon” it reminded me of Reminders of Him by Colleen Hoover 🤣🥺
HELLO GUYS! I AM OLIA FROM UKRAINE AND I DO MY VLOG IN SPANISH if you are interesting to what will be so nice) i want to have friends on youtube and in life) lets be friends
I… sat on the same chair as her
I LOVE YOU💙
I'm from europe... the tampon thing had me lololol😂😂 👏
Emma. This new video format is perfection. I never want them to end!
omgg yess best birthday present
Nowadays you’re everywhere, but home
EMMA PLS TELL ME WHAT EXACT PART OF AMSTERDAM
Not me finally being early to a Emma video
her videos really bring out the serotonin like man
Emma babe, that‘s how we put in our tampon in Europe.
Just wow!💗
EMMA SPIT ON ME
my fav person ever
I love Emma so much and I loved this video too as someone who lives in The Netherlands and who was actually born in Amsterdam!!
soooo good emma, i love this type of video. Thank you for making me smile every time ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m in Germany visiting family and came to the same tampon realization!🤦🏻‍♀️😭
I also was on my period there and I was not a fan of those LOL
emma is the only one who can make the netherlands look aesthetic
THE SGT PEPPER SHIRT 😫😫😫😫😫😫👍👍👍👍👍
Visiting Amsterdam soon so can’t wait to try the chocolates and cheeses !
So many beautiful shot's of this city!I'm in love  ๑⁠♡⁠⌓⁠♡⁠๑ I have to go there!!!
I never miss her uploads. She’s so pretty 😍
what songs is she using i need to know 😭
It's so weird to me that Americans need applicators to insert a tampon. Like... just use your finger like a normal person.
I’m sure why or how but my eyes wanted to cry at the boat scene
14:31 for anyone who's read reminders of him... omg
I love your style, vibe and positivity, Emma-plain and simple🤗💕😋
this is so fun to watch cuz i live in the netherlands and iv been to amsterdam and like she is shops that i have seen. My day is so much better now
hi emma. i've been here at amsterdam for 2 months and i am leaving in a week cause my imternship will end. but while i was here, i fell in love with this city and it's aura. you and your dad managed to capture it perfectly. ofc i have my own memories and videos, photos but it is always nice to see this city from someone else's perspective. i just know that this will be the video i will watch whenever i miss amsterdam. thank you guys.
Come to Almelo! Most beautiful city of The Netherlands. We have really nice traffic lights.🚦
I'm literally living for Emma's videos! She is the most comfortable person i've ever seen. I rewatch her videos constantly cause i can't stop (and i don't wanna, actually). She is my inspiration, she is adorable and stunning! i want to meet her one day just to say how much i love her, she doesn't know that i'm even exist but she is always with me when i feel frustrated or anxious. she is a queen, period. p.s. sorry for mistakes if you see them, english isn't my mother language. <3
I LOVE YOU EMMA
that might have been the greatest haul of all time
not her living my dream
she is one of the best things to ever come out of this universe.
one of her best videos yet
I love the European aesthetic tour. ❤️❤️❤️

Emma your vlogs bring me so much comfort
Who travels with you?
She is iconic
Do somebody know the brand of her sunglasses ?
i love this new style of emmas  videos.
emma is literally my therapist
this isnt a video, this is therapy.
Gotta make sure your hands are immaculately clean with those kinds of tampons! I found out the hard way on a 15 hour flight back from Australia and got an infection 🫠
noooo not episode! Next time you should definitely should visit zipper instead
My favourite part was the haul
Emma they're the only tampons we've gooooot
Great. Now I want bread, cheese and chocolate.
OMG EMMMAAA!!!!! You were here <3333333333333
i smiled trough this whole thing
The HAUL ❤️😭❤️😭
Man, i don't even know how to say  much I love her
I love Amsterdam and I love Emma 💯💛
Bro I was in Amsterdam at the same time but when I left to Paris, my sister told me she was in Amsterdam. I felt like crying pls
was having a really horrible day thank goodness emma posted
YEEESSS DUCUUU I KKKK IMVE BEEN FEEDDDD
emma the goat
I absolutely love that she's just traveling around Europe with her dad and enjoying herself. She looks so happy
Ooh!
This video is perfection. From the music choice and coordination with the editing to the pigeon socks 🤌🏼
Never disappoint? my curiosity made me cry when I read Emma's chats on this displayed.Life sadly stay Be proud of yourself you got this
This was amazing !!!
Emma chamberlain die casually naar de appie gaat, zo mooi
the try on haul kinda gave off Joana Ceddia vibes
Loose tampons are pretty common in Australia also! They’re fairly easy to use it just does become a bit invasive. I’m glad you could find one. Also sad because I was just in Amsterdam now in Rotterdam, I recommend coming here!
I was just there myself! Gorgeous place.
I still cant believe americans really use an implicator for tampons every time
The bee just left the Coffee shoppe...
Love you Emma
The music on beat with her flipping through the jeans is so satisfying
Welcome to our country, did u like it?
What is an tampon applicator?
I'm a boy and never received an education on tampons before
s/o big mike🫡💯
The YouTube community has missed you queen 🥹🥹🫶🫶
Today has been really tough and the haul scene at the end genuinely just made me laugh and feel so much better. Genuine YouTube gold 😭🥺
emma: there is no applicator!!! i don't know how to use this!!! me: *confused in european*
Emma people call me basic and tell me that my outfits need more accessories and that I’m not stylish what should I do? Bc this makes me wanna change my style completely
what a video emma i love u
it gives me utter peace when i watch her videos, it's so therapeutic. I JUST LOVE HER
I feel like having your dad film creates a special bond and is so wholesome 🥲 remember to hug your dad if you can people!!
Emma Watson ❤
La sonrisa del señor que estaba pintando cuando le compran un cuadro es>>>>>>

this is so weird that i literally have never seen her in real life and she probably doesn’t know that i exist, but SHE IS MY BEST FRIEND :]]
she's the best friend that we all need. luv you babes!
The fact you went to not so typical tourist spots made my day, Amsterdam is mij home city and you went to places I normally would go. So this is really nice to see.
This is sooo gooooodddd ❤️❤️❤️❤️
When Emma is talking to us and the elevator opens 🏃🏼‍♀️
NIJNTJE CHOCOLATE EXCIST?!

I seriously love the try on haul. It literally just brighten my mood.
Netflix give Emma her travel show already

That shot with the man showing his paintings, I’m gonna bawl my eyes for the next 10 days
Did that dog at 2:03 just moonwalk?!
every 'emma youtube video day' is a good day
All of a sudden my depression is cured because Emma posted
wow first she takes a lot of clothes, then she doesnt wear it and decides to ship it  and by that create extra CO2 emissions which could`ve been avoided if she just thought twice about it
as someone who's from the Netherlands and lived in the same town as you in 2017 this is just the best thing ever <3
Never disappoint? my curiosity made me cry when I read Emma's chats on this displayed.Life sadly stay Be proud of yourself you got this

Look at her confidence filming and being her self in public!! I remember her vlogging in NYC and being uncomfortable...talk about confidence growth <3
I was just watching your older videos this morning and this just came up. I LOVE YOU EMMA! ❤️
You are wearing those Adidas girl!!! and I’m loving every minute of it! I have them in white and they’re just not as good as the black ones that you have. Killing it Emma!💕
always making us happy <3 cant wait 4 the next one
13:51 lmao the way you continued eating the soup, same
As a European it's so funny. Why would you need an applicator it's unnecessary waste
I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUU EMMAAAAAAA
WAKE UP EMMA POSTED
YOU WERE IN THE CITY I LIVE IN AND I DIDNT SEE YOU NO
Great
Love it 🎉
emma makes amsterdam actually look fun
migliorato la giornata come sempre
it has always BLOWN my MIND that americans don't like applicator-less tampons??? less waste?? and i mean let's be real we're all putting our fingers up there anyway lol
2:30: American women traveling to Europe... its entertaining every time
this video will be my hyperfixation for a lot of time.it just has something in it that makes me feel in peace.
Emma again in another country. The best YouTuber in the world
Smells like McDonalds drive-thru…your car
Is her dad the one doing the filming ?
12:48 first human being cuttin cheese like that
the comedic timing at 2:24 was impeccable
aaaaaa i clicked SO FAST!!!
12:12 this being in tune lovee
Never disappoint? my curiosity made me cry when I read Emma's chats on this displayed.Life sadly stay Be proud of yourself you got this
Love how she finds out we just stick them up there with our finger ☝🏻 Less waste not having those applicators, fingers can be washed 😁
emma and lorelai gilmore would be such good frineds
I missed seeing you, please do a makeup video soon💗😁
14:53 😂
Emma living the life we all wanna live ✨
I loved this video🥰so happy you edit your own vids again, you just have this authentic vibe to your videos and it feels like I’m on this trip with you, so cool that you have your dad filming for you too🫶🏽
WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE
when i did my study abroad semester i had my mom ship over a 4 month supply of american tampons bc i could not for the life of me use the 'loose' tampons lol
coming home from work to see that emma uploaded >>>>>>>>>
Emma is our hero.
GIRLLL u don't know how happy this notification made me, amsterdam is my favorite city in europe and u r my favorite youtuber and this is now officially my favorite video EVER oml <333333🥺
12:13 The Best Timing!
Thank you
FINALLY
cutest ever omg
I was always scared of tampons in the us because they’re so LONG, I just didn’t know why and I refused to buy them there
my comfort person <33
11:52 love this shot
Emma my heart ❤️
shes my bsf istg
so hilarious to see emma in an albert heijn lol
Fun fact, most of the positive comments were written before people even see the video.
I need to know if she got those pants😭😭😭😭
that's so unbelievable and incredible. the best Comfort place
The only thing that keeps me going are your videos fr, its so hard to describe but they make me so happy
Omg
Why is it always 24 hours? 😭
How she's eating the cheese.. my heart hurts as a dutchie :(
i am so incredibly happy you're back
You made my day girl
that looks so fun. thank you emma!
rly sad I couldn’t meet you in Amsterdam ): rly hope you had a nice time there Emma your video made my day 💕
words cannot explain how much these videos make me FEELLLL
the montage that served as a haul is my new definition of a haul
I love Emma so much
The fact that I live an hour away from Amsterdam and go to school there I feel like I missed my opportunity meeting this icon 😭😥
i like your haul
please come to basel, switzerland
the credits :)))
what adidas she is using?
So fun to see a vlog in my country!
Are you still here?
European Tampons are the bane of my existence. And if you don’t stick them up super high in there, they fall out when you pee.
Wait what?! What's an applicator and why?
If micheal scott was a vlogger, she gives micheal scott vibes.
you're so lovely emma, i appreciate u lots
Did anyone notice how cheap tampons are?? I would go there just to stock up lmfao
11:52 that was cute lol <3
Seeing Emma living her life the way she wants and doing everything on her own is truly so inspiring. Love from a fellow creator <3
when both Emma and Casey upload within hours of each other 😩😩 my heart can’t handle it
Man this is my first time watching her and the content is soo pure ,loved her vibe.
dis my fav out of the spontainious travels series
i dont know if the editing of the thrift shopping montage was on purpose but did anyone notice how she moved the jeans along the rack at 12:13 was on beat to the song on every jeans. so satisfying!
I was like ugh I need to watch one of Emma vlogs and opened YouTube to this.
As an european, I'm so offended about how she cut the cheese... Love u emma
I was that day in Amsterdam to, I’m so sad I didn’t get to meet you!
i’m so sad i didn’t see you because i live in amsterdam, but hoped you enjoyed it <3
for some reason the loose tampon sent me because I was imagining them rolling down the streets of Amsterdam and someone shouting "Watch out! Tampon on the loose!"
now we need one for italy, it's so funny you uploaded this cos ive just spent hours editing my travel vlog inspired by you xxx
OMG I JUST CAME BACK FROM AMSTERDAM HOW DID I NOT SEE UU 😂 it's such a beautiful country tho ❤
honestly loving the raw content
my hometown 💕💕💕💕💕
these are normal tampons in Europe, I haven't even seen one with an applicator in my entire life:)
I loved when the music matched the movement of the jeans
My day is complete  (◕ᴗ◕✿)
I feel good when i see your videos
I’m in a quiet phone room at work and absolutely lost my shit with the try on haul dance break. God .
Never disappoint? my curiosity made me cry when I read Emma's chats on this displayed.Life sadly stay Be proud of yourself you got this
curious to see your camera man
emma's videos are literally therapy.
I love to see you traveling, it seems like you are having fun really exploring the world and yourself. Ngl tho in the back of my mind I'm wondering if you miss your cats and who is taking care of them 😆
so proud of Emma for allowing herself to evolve and her content with her. hope she’s proud of herself ☺️✨
no coffee, no workee
A literal gift when Emma uploads. I love her editing choice so much and her dads filming is perfect. Love you emma 🖤
I recognize my hometown Haarlem in the first shots <3 i cannot believe you were there and i missed you!! take care xx
how do you stay thin eating that and drinking wine
wow Ems you're so effortlessly beautiful
Love u
Just get another suitcase
When Emma posts ifeel like ihave no debt in the little moment of joy
Emma your my mental cure
Please say you filmed in Bath😭

emma in de appie ?!?!
Wow I really have to start appreciating my city more cause your video truly captures its beauty

MY GIIIIIRL !!! soooo happy to see your traveling vids mwahhh love u bestie
I’m so proud of you
How does McDonald’s drive through smell like
me, full well knowing she was in Amsterdam from all my friend’s who met her BeReal’s: omg!!
Hi Emma, I used to dislike you cause I find you annoying in the Sister Squad videos but I recently stumbled upon on one of your vlogs and got me hooked. I realized that I didn't like "you" but i disliked the other people in the "Sister Squad". Now I'm binging all of your vlogs cause I find you very authentic and real. Wishing you all the best and keep on making vlogs. 👏🏻
Omg😩im in love with this new style
Ilysm
I KNOW i’ll be rewatching every day for the next week
Emma your such a vibe !!!  You never fail to put me in a  happy mood (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤
as for the "loose tampon" problem; most european countries use tampons without applicators. it uses less plastic, you just gotta properly wash your hands before and after, no biggie!
That dog tho…
Yeeeeees i love it!!! :)
OMG Emma in Albert Heijn
I’m crying that you were literally in the Netherlands when i was on vacation 😞
lovee it! hope you enjoyed your time here:)
OMG SO EARLY
Loose tampon = less plastic come on ladies. Jk idk I really dont
thank you emma
This was sOOOOOO good
Literally the second i see that Emma posted a video i get my will to live back, i watch her videos in a religious way
i love the b roll of her and her dad from afar it gives such a unique vibe to the cinematography 🤌🏼💋
Your here! Wow, please come to ‘s-Hertogenbosch cause Amsterdam is soooo the same!
maybe you can do 24 hours in Kyiv, Ukraine 0-0
Her dad is the cutest!
I see extended close-up croissant munching, I like.
the music coinciding with emma looking through the jeans was ***muah*** chefs kiss
These last few videos.. amazing 🙌🏻
11:53 so cuteeee
I’m actually so surprised Emma doesn’t hire someone anymore to do the editing! She’s amazing!
i love you emma
omg i cant believeeeee it! the first 10 sec of the video is literally where i fuckin live!!! 🥹🥹🥹🥹
emma’s videos give me so much serotonin
A masterpiece every upload
Love your shoes wearing the same
I love seeing you back🥹
please come to turkey!!! ♥️😍♥️
the excitement i got everytime i see the video notification from this girl is the exact same i got when i see a friend that i didn´t see in a long time
did you ever find out what you needed the scissors for?
you make me keep going in life
I love Emma. We all can relate to the things she does😂😂
God i missed her so much!
This channel has become Rick Steve's Europe but Emma with Emma vibes and in love with it.
The haul we've all been waiting for
I think the short nails suit you better ❤
these videos are my reason in life
Did she just cut a chunk out of the cheese!?!?
that was not a bee emma it was a wasp 😭😭
love you emma 🥺
i got sooooo happy when i saw her in a AH omg.
Your video style is amazing 🥹. it feels like i am watching a peaceful cinematography and each video that you have posted , it was made with full dedication and since you have been travelling, it’s amazing to see those places with your POV. This is a content creator 🤍
When emma is in the ad before her own video.... how meta...
i love when the audio bleeds onto the next clip
not me absolutely waiting how shes gonna use these tampons and say us how it feels—
the eldery man smiling at 8:55  LET ME BUY ALL HIS LITTLE PAINTINGS!!!!!😭
hi emma
Well yes Emma you didn’t know? When in Amsterdam you gotta bleach out that coochy hole out girl! Lol 💀 Edit: Love your dancing socks, and especially love that you and your dad can travel together like this and make amazing memories, and I get it you have traveled alone a lot, but I think when you go out of the country you should have someone with you! I wish so badly that I still had my dad to do stuff with he was the best! Yours seems like he is too !
I feel like every country we see emma in she sees more dogs then I do in my mcdonalds drive threw an I'm literally in love with .🤣❤
so r we ever going to see the new house that was getting built a while back??
These videos are such a vibe
love you Emma
It’s so weird to me that Americans have applicators for their tampons. Like how are you getting it in there 😭
U LOOK SOOOO GOOOOD
Post the booth photos plzzzzzz
love it
In 12:13 i don't know if it was intentional but i have to say if it was (and probably was) THAT WAS PERFECT, the music fit perfectly. I don't know why i liked it that much but it was worthy enough to write a comment with my broke english :)
love this and love you.
I lived in Amsterdam for 7 months and watching this brings me back there… ugh so many memories! Thank you Emma 💓💓
im not able to keep up. isnt she here in Venice right now? lol
these videos are so well put together i love them so much
this made my day 100 times better
I jus LOVE this women bro.
The first 10 seconds are actually not Amsterdam, but Haarlem (next to Amsterdam)
I love how she is American and her reaction on food in europe
The dance with the haul was everything.   The blue shorts with butterflies.      Omg.   greatttttttt videoooooo 😍😍😍😍😎❤️
WHERE DID SHE GET THOSE SUNGLASSES
i hope that couple at 11:53 sees this and gets a cute candid video of themselves because thats so nice  what kind of drug is emma putting in her videos because im relaxed asf?????
Cool video Emma I've spend some time there myself beautiful place good choice on socks I like  hope your good so where next have a good weekend look forward to seeing next video all the best seth 💜💚
Your travel vlogs bring me so much joy
The Photo Booth pictures are so good she looks amazing
I wanted an answer to the scissors problem
Emma in de appie is een hele vibe also loose tampons are the only ones we use cuz we are warriors
this really refreshed my entire day! thank you emma! 💌
ILYSMMMMMMMMMMM
I really needed it today🫶🏻
i really love this new concept!
I guess she’s just traveling everywhere even when the pandemic hit just because her multi million dollar home doesnt satisfy her boredom
@12:38 the sounds of iced coffee in a glass made me crave coffee ugh. Guess I'll cave
God did
The socks and subsequent haul montage… top cinema 🥵
SOUP BEE
i had a HORRIBLE day n this vid made me feel much BETTER THANKS🤍
I swear she’s never home anymore lol. She really said F America
Her videos and editing are just getting better and better ❤️
Love you Emma. You are huge inspiration for me and my channel!
Emma don't bring scissors on an airplane for nothing please! When I was 14 I was like oh I'm gonna bring some on the cruise to do my homework an I almost got my mom attested 🤣❤💀she literally wanted to kill me that day it's actually legal
PEACEFUL VIBES!! I really love your editing style somehow it’s so relaxing and it gives me a cozy vibes and i do really enjoy every second of it! 🥹
you can’t imagine how much I needed this right now
I was cracking up when she said “ what’s a loose tampon “😂😂😂 because I said the exact same thing !
Part was in haarlem and i live there and it is amazing to see this
emma do you even now how much you helped me and how much i loooove you ?
love
Te amo
I JUST F ING LOVE YOU
omg hello i was waiting for you to post today 🤭
you gotta love her. you just do
It's so funny to me how people in the US use applicators for their tampons...it's so much plastic waste...
i love the way you say goood 😭you’re so awesome
LOL ily “it’s a crime scene” HAHAH
you look like a movie star in the photos ❤️
I fell on my run tonight. Got all bloody and cried a lot. Got home and ran a bath, opened youtube and found that Emma had posted! My tears have long dried! Had a chuckle at the supermarket tampon trip 😂 only you Emma!!!
Kudos to Mr. Chamberlain's B Roll & cinematography in general.
what is the deal with the bee's now days??? The question is was that bee suicidal or just hungry for some soup??? unbelievable.
emma should be the star of her own movie one day, i swear.
EMMA'S BACK YOUR SO AWESOME EMMA.. LOVE YOU GIRL !
FUCKINGGG LOVED THIS ONEEE
tampons without applicators are in the us too, but they are strictly for crazy people😂
😍😍
no applicator - less waste though that's pretty cool
what jean si she wearing?
hi
Why do I feel like crying because she’s in my country and hometown? I just feel like it’s so special that she’s so close or sum
This was beautiful to watch. I'm loving this new traveling series a lot 😍❤
everything is a vibe
i get the feeling she is a shopaholic
She is my fashion icon  Loving you emma🤍
But what's the point of shopping though? You know you're always going to wear a white/ black t-shirt + a pair of too short levis anyway. 🤔🙄🙂
i love you.
hi emma ily
new emma post new emma post
Oh thank god Emma is still alive
Madame! You are the fucking chaos. Also do you have a favourite Wes Anderson film? Bc all I get are those vibes from your editing skills. True talent. 🍀❤️

💝❤
EMMAAAA comeee to The Hagueeeee

This is art. It's just genius. It's simple. But it grabs your attention in the best way possible.  it's the best content I've ever seen. She was born to make videos. ❤️
I love your vids Emma
Its just so funny to me (as a dutch person) that emma shipped home an “Albert Heijn” grocery bag 😂 thats the most dutch thing ever come on!!!
ITS GIVING ITS GIVING
we never got an update on the tampon
soooo guuuud
thank you mr. chamberlain for this video🙏🏼 we love you🫶🏼
Love youu
my fav person ever, when she uploads is makes my whole day
in germany u also dont get an applicator for the tampons
I am in high school and recently my teacher was asking us about our best friends and write about them.I without any doubt wrote 2 page essay on EMMA.Just a reflex for her.......
i love you
my favorite city in the whole world, i miss it so much every day💕
You made amsterdam look so calm😂
thanks for existing
My day just got amazingly better. Thank you! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️✨
I live in Amsterdam but I didn’t know she was there uhhu
IN MY HOME CITY OMG ILY
Its so cool to see a famous person walk in the city you live and walk everyday
i really needed that, thank you
she keeps me breathing and she keeps me inspired. emma makes me feel so safe and comfortable. she literally saves me. i im so grateful for her<3
i love u sm
The haul was fanatic 🤌🏼
So happy for this literally needed this
I live in the netherlands and i really hate it, but this 17 min vid made me kinda love it again
She looks tired and ten years older😂
I’m obsessed
europe really fits emma. so happy to see her traveling and enjoying life <3
Imagine running into Emma Chamberlain at the Appie…
it was so good to see you
the cinematography in all ur videos recently is so good and it’s so relaxing
Let’s appreciate mr chamberlain for the amazing filming and Emma for making our days
Omg thank goodness
Love your vlogs Emma ❤🤘
THE WINE REALLY KICKED IN IN THAT HAUL HUH 😭
BEEN WAITING FOR THISS
Emma really made it aesthetic to buy tampons. And that's why she is queen
Gekoloniseerd
In australia we only have like one brand with and applicator - we always have single Little ones like that. I thought applicators where uncommon lol
You can’t hate her she is just so lovable
I love this video
the way she says GOOID is so funny lol
Say hi to lando
These are good 👍 So good ! You and your dad are a great team ❤️
Not Emma stopping at Albert Hein😍😍😍😍😍
exactly what I needed right now
love u queen
the pictures at the end looked good
Did you get high
I am there tomorrow u wanna meet?😅🥴
Wonderful videoooo
The try on haul was everything. Your energy is so exciting & I’m so happy you are so happy!
ugh i love this vid sm
12:48 Did she really just CUT the cheese?! ☠☠☠
I still can’t believe I’ve missed you we were so so close
can’t believe i was at the same spots like emma chamberlain🥹🥹
*Emma uploads a video* me: its going to be a great day!! 😭🤍
I've had to start slowing down her videos because they are so aethetically pleasing and she's traveling everywhere I'd love to go.
Ilyyyyy
Emma, why didn't just buy another suitcase instead of shipping?
Wish i could travel with u
The haul montage was so pure
IM CRYING YOU WHERE IN MY COUNTRY AAAAAHHHH 🤎🤎🤎🤎🤎
How did i miss that Emma is/was in the Netherlands??
love you emma
Hey im early! I am a young teen and your my idol because you make me feel comfortable and make me want to be who i am cause<3
Em in the Dam…cmon now💚
that haul tho🔥
i love her.
I LOVE HER😫
This feels like a documentary. Love these vlogs!!!
The haul is EVERYTHING
please know I love you.
The editing is so soothing. I’m currently on my period and dying but this makes me feel so much better
YOU WERE IN DEN HAAG NO ONE TOLD ME
emma deciding which clothes to send home reminds me of tv shows where someone has to choose people to eliminate at the end of each week 💀
Never been so early
still mad that i was there the same weekend and I did not run into her :(
Yes, we don't use applicators for tampons here in Europe. You just insert it with fingers. It's very normal for us, applicators would feel weird actually. But I guess for Americans it would be kinda crazy if you hadn't ever used it without before.
yes emsky
Emma’s videos now days are just so therapeutic.
after a long day at school, this vid is exactly what I needed
going to amsterdam over new years, cant wait!
it’s the fact that I was at the same location, same place as Emma in Haarlem but I didn’t see her 😭
Literally the whole time I was: ha...i live there
YYYYYYYYYYEEEEEESSSSS I WAS WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT
what sunglasses are those?
The way the song synchronized with you looking though those clothes soothed my soul.
As A dutchie: I screamed when i saw this😍😍😍
Love you Bestie Emma😘
THAT FIRST CLIIP WAS IN HAARLEM!!!
I just want to hangout with pigeons and Emma 🐦
the music coordinated with the moving on the jeans on the rack was SO good omg
oh my god as a dutchie i love this sm
best cameraman award for her dad, you can really tell the difference with Emma in the vlogs he films vs someone else, she is more comfortable and he really captures her best side. her videos really inspire me to find my own unique editing and storytelling style like she has
SHES SO REAL
You watch anime Emma?
Saved the day, everytime <3
yessss emma dropped
The joy I get from an emma video is unmatched
Omg ema I'm on my period too our mensies sinked in we besties
You made our day ✨
who is the cameraman? They did an awesome job!
❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
I can’t believe I missed you in Amsterdam 😭 brb gonna cry now
The man who was selling his art, was so cute 🥺
i want that cat shirt
haarlemm :))
The queen has returned.
missed u so much
Awww the couple interaction 🙈🥲
Omgg this is amazing 🤩 I live in the Netherlands and its so funny to see Amsterdam pictured like this cause its so familiar to me ❤️ xx
haha why waste more plastic on those applicators? loose tampongs foreva, don't be scared to up ur finger there xD
11:52 they’re the main character
NOOOOO I WAS IN AMSTERDAM THE SAME TIME YOU WERE IM SO UPSET RN
We love a travelling queen
My grandma is from the Netherlands so this makes me very happy 🧡🧡🧡
I was just in Amsterdam that's crazy Emma good for you I wonder what you think
In europe most tampons you’ll find don’t ever come with an applicator - because of the plastic waste :) just fyi
I love how she takes her dad everywhere
yes, yes, yes.
God I love emma
perfect timing <3 <3 the best way to not eat lunch alone, love you emmaaaaaaaa

love seeing emma thriving and living a peaceful life out of the country
I think you need the scissors to cut out the tags out of your new clothes.😉
Emma walking out of the shipping place Fucking had me dyingggg 😂Fucking LOVE YOU Emma. You make me smile and there’s some sense of calmness while I watch your vlogs! Edit: the haul was *chefs kiss*
Her videos feel so crisp and refreshing
you make my days better. i love you so much and your videos give me peace and comfort i love you 🫶🏼💌
8:55, that man selling his beautiful art just makes me so happy, i wish i could go there and support him <3
Honestly never seen Amsterdam so...not busy af 😅 I'm from Frisia, though, so I haven't been there too many times, to be honest. Frisia is also very beautiful, south west Frisia, you're welcome here anytime! Also, love that you're living your best life, babes 🥰
Hi emma
Hi Emma ! Love you, much love, kisses ! 🤣😘🤪 #adventuroustings
watching somebody in horror find out that there’s barely any tampons with applicators in europe is a delight everytime
i love her editing
THANK YOU FOR MAKE MY DAY EMMA LOVE U
I LOVE YOU😭🫶🏼
I couldn’t stop laughing. I love you Emma!!
the Miffy chocolate!!
i love everything about emma’s editing style, it’s so comforting & the way she captures people is just so beautiful

The tampon...

9:29 that bunny was my childhood and you just ate it?! 😭
this made my day
Who shoots Emma clips?
Today’s my last day in Amsterdam and you’re telling me I could have WALKED PAST HER? devastated tbh
🤣🤣🤣🤣 Tampon without applicator is easy the first times might not be easy but you just need to know the anatomy
im living for these videos omg 🥹
you’re the vibe Emma :)
love u forever emma
This is making everyone’s day
🐦🧦
Hurray!! Xxoxoxoox
YESSSSS LOVE YOU EMMA
her videos are so calm and therapeutic
Emma uploading a new video >>>>> anything else in my sub page
missed u<3
Yayy❤
QUEEN IS BACKK AND NOW MY DAY HAS BEEN MADE😍😭
OMG I JUST WOKE UP THIS IS PERFECT
gave the video a like before i even watched it <3 love u emma
It's like she lives in a different world than us and she is the only person there
hahahaha ze neemt een albert heijn tas mee naar amerika
I love how she's taking her time with videos. She's not just pumping out two shitty videos a week like other YouTubers, but she's doing like once a month and making a really specially crafted and edited that shows a beautiful aesthetic story. The videos also don't have like 10 minutes of stupid rambling to add more time.
love it when my queen uploads
MY HOME HAHAHAHA
SHE MADE MY DAY
Every YouTube notification from Emma lights up my face. Love you<3
"all i need to know about life, i learned from my cat" I NEED THAT TEE OMG
These vlogs are so therapeutic. It's so relatable and relaxing, I don't know how to exactly describe it.
Emmaaa 😘😘
