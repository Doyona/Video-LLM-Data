Workout in an icebox wtf. Boys are steaming.
Bro, I could see their breath that’s how cold it was😂😂😂
Super cool that you involve your son in this too.
He lifts like a robot it’s nuts so smooth
EDIE YOUR KID HAVE PSIHICK AND  FIZIC PROBLEMS !!. bECAUSE OFF HEMISTRY !!.
Jamie THE GIANT Christian. *brian shaw has entered the chat*
Hey strongest man, i like to see how u doing that! Dont stop to bring the power in form :)
Name a better duo of training  Then these two. I’ll wait..🔥
Eddie what do you do for cramps? More water? Electrolytes?
"15, i don't i've ever counted that far in my life." That's literally the number of reps on the Viking Press that won him the title in 2017, no?
THE STEAM COMING OFF EDDIE YEEEW
I'm 300lb in weight but only lift 225lb
Chris literally steaming 19:20
21:00 Eddie‘s smoking lol
9:17 peak performance
Can't wait to see max in a year.
Boy will be bigger than you I think 👍
Max will give you some serious competition someday.  He has great focus for his age !
Steroids!! These guys won’t see 50
8:31 Look at Eddies son in the background, you can see he's taking everything in from his hand gestures
I just did that leg workout today and my legs are killing me.
Hearing that Eddie Hall  takes several days to recover from soreness makes me feel a little better. I take like a week at least.
I want to see you train with TOM PLATZ
seeing eddie train his son and build his self esteem  is the best
What's the point of this? He is one of the best strongmen but his talent for bodybuilding is very obviously zero
Eddie your head is huge
Lol terrible form by everyone in this video 🤣🤣
If your going into bodybuilding check out mike mentzer pretty sure you will have heard of him. listen to his audio tapes plenty on YouTube.What he says seems the most logical & scientific way to workout .it makes sense I think he was on to something which seems pretty much ignored because people are stuck in there ways & think more is better.
love how he was complaining taht its cold.. then all you see if steam comming off him
I can see the steam coming off of you while you're working out.
the fact that they inlcude the kid is amazing. good parenting
Reckon he left the tank parked out the front?
@eddie the beast You should collaborate with Dorian Yates. He is a tremendous well of information and technique for bodybuilding.
Max just rowed 20kg 🤯🤯
this is not how you get big smh
The weight is to heady he keeps lifting his ass of the seat !
max smashin it 💪
i cant wait to see eddies end transformations. inspirational to me as a big lad who want to try and achieve the same
18:55 I`ve never seen so much smoke coming off a guy from working out mans not taking off his jacket either Im ded laughing straight for 3 minutes for this lmao
Where this dude live , Alaska?
E-Bum's here 🤣
When the 300lb champion bodybuilder watches you hit 20 on fullstack to failure rest 20 seconds then hit 10 more rest 20 secs then hit 10 more.  Bro was flabbergasted, you shouldn't be able to do that.  It doesn't make sense.
Grande Eddy!!!! Saludos desde Argentina
Is his waist too big for body building? I always thing of bodybuilders with small waists and huge lats. He’s going to have to really widen his wings to give the illusion of a smaller waist
you
Trained at this gym a while ago.. unfortunately he closed it to the public after COVID
“Headbutt the weight” —EDDIE HALL 😂
Kids working out in Jordan's? 😀 Doing it right.
Not gonna lie, if there is ever a soundtrack that fits Eddie, it’s the Mick Gordon Doom Soundtrack lol
What's the name of the music at 13:50 ?
Is the gym not heated? Kinda weird o_o
You are not doing the pulldowns properly, also you should be using wraps or something similar as your forearms will give way 1st
Ilkeston Gym. what a shame. The first gym I have a train at. Now you have to pay £1000 a month to train there
that little boy is strong. I was more surprised by him than the giants.
Reminds me of sitting in my room in the winter with the windows open, bare chest. Workout to stay warm.
why tf is it soooo cold in that gym
Bro is no one else gonna say that he was literally steaming literally st the beginning of the vidoe
He must find progressive overload so hard because he can already do full stacks
hey Eddie you should try linking up with Cuba cielen dudes is an animal
Kids form is great
They're just moving weight, not building muscle. Slow those reps down and feel the burn darnit.
Eddie has quite possibly the most unaesthetic physic ever but good luck
love the shout out for your son and promoting him. good dad shit
Why is it so damn cold in there lol
I can’t wait to see Eddie drop the intake for the cut cause damn the gut   I know he can do it
What a great help jamie is and such a nice guy , Eddie kicking arse as usual both amazing .
10:35 Smoke comes out from Eddie made me laugh haha!
the fact that eddie hall just start smoking after half the vid just is goated
This guy is a monster!! His personality is like a regular dude. Guys like this, you call a friend lol.
We are learn something from you thank you guys
subbed to jamie 5 min in the video. Explains really well the movements love that attitude :)
Been body building for 9 years I am 54 now Welcome to my world Eddie you will love it
Eddie get max ready to be a UK wsm winner 🏆 cracking work lads
I think you already have the bulk. Maybe just focus on eating lean and training, In my opinion. But I would get a second opinion from your bodybuilding pals. Excited to see how it turns out. 👍
As someone who loves the cold I think I would enjoy working out in this gym. Kind of like the original Rocky meat locker workouts but with weights.
there are full grown men doing lats with the same weight as Max. It's incredible how stupid strong he already is at his age. great video guys!
He said E BUMS HERE
Eddie is the greatest,  and I love seeing him have his son in the video and doing some work outside with them...   I look forward to seeing Eddie's journey in bodybuilding
So even though I’m a new lifter or new to being consistent I try to push the limits and pay attention to the resistance I can’t wait to try some of these workouts tonight at the gym love y’all Eddie
When will you be ready to compete
What did he say at 9:27 ?
Why is it so cold in there?  Eddie steamin' it up
CBUM vs E-Hall, who wins?
Don't bulk, start cutting right now
Eddie is actually getting that v-shape. Fair play.
Bro went from seeing his own breath to steaming
E-Bum😂 Classic Physique Division, Eddie? Really?  Your leg is over the weight limit
Let's appreciate little Eddie for having an interest in this sport, just like his dad.
doom eternal intro I see that
bro eddie you do nooot need to bulk up xD  get that waist and body fat procent down and you will look like a bodybuilder
These videos have been so wholesome. Love it. ❤
It always blows my mind seeing a bodybuilder and strong man side by side. Just going on looks you would always think the bodybuilder was stronger. Just crazy how different training gives you such a different look. Obviously props to both Jamie and Eddie they both crush their fields but fuck one is all show and no go and the other is kinda show but will fucking GO!
Bro bouta turn into the attack titan
Ain’t this Ilkeston gym  ?
Love bodybuilder Eddie
Keep pushing 💪 Eddie
I wonder what steroids Eddie took during his strongman days and what he takes do to this bodybuilding thing?
Why every people on this channel is such a lovely person? Giant looks so humble and a cool human being 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Hey Eddie I like you and all but you saying your gonna be a bigger version of bumstead🤣 come on man bumstead has atleast 40-50lbs more muscle than you, if bumstead was as overweight as you he'd be like 400lbs
My 8 yr old son is OBSESSED with the strongman content from you and Shaw.  He has asked how much weight you can deadlift without showing any signs of strain at all - red face, grunts, etc. (Gotta love the mind of an 8 yr old!!)
Lol, I use my truck as my gym sometimes (mostly Planet Fitness😉) and I make this thing as cold as possible, or go outside during the winter in a T-shirt and shorts, to see if I can work hard enough to break a sweat, or at least keep warm🔥💪🔥Love the concept🤜🤛
Loved this
Max is a fricken legend
Brzuch to jego dominującą partia
He needs to lower the weight and focus on the form. He is jerking stuff around too much, this isn't strongman you don't need to be strong. You need proper form and time under tension. There isn't any need to try to use as much weight as you can and risk injury if your not performing to lift as much weight as possible.
yoo what pre you guys prefer?
It's crazy how eddie has a stomach and a six pack at the same time.  That's impressive
Max actually has great form lol
w vid
Giant dose handles up and you did every set handle’s down any different in gain or muscular strength
Eddie Hall aka The Squeaker 😝
For someone with so much training experience I’m shocked Eddie is silly enough to think he needs to bulk up.
The cut’s gonna be insane
Are they working out in a freezer? I can see their breathe
Eddie struggles a bit with controlling it as it is a massive change in training. Jamie strains smart, controlled and working the muscle.
11:05 Eddie is steaming 😂
Eddie Hall is going to be getting a tan soon, this is going to be hilarious!!!
I think trying to cut from 400 lbs is a bad idea personally.  You're already at 20% bodyfat probably maybe 15% but you have to get down to like 6% which is CRAZY lean!!
I think the hardest part of bodybuilding on a competitive level, especially if you are over 30, would be the diet.  I supposed if you don't care about living past 40-50 you could take enough drugs to cut on a bad diet but most people want to live longer and so they have to follow a really strict and low calorie diet while also working out hard.
The thing people don't realize about strongman competitors is that they are actually in pretty incredible areobic and anarobic shape for the massive size.  Strongman is has a lot of running, walking, etc. with heavy loads so you have to have some conditioning.
I'm rooting for you Eddie!!! Whatever you do don't give up!  My tip is to really feel the exercises in the intended muscles.  It's much better to lighten the weight if needed so that you can really feel the contractions.  Heavy is good but not at the expensive if feeling the contractions.  On rows you really need to pull shoulders back and try and pinch your spine almost.  Back is a hard muscle to feel and train right.
The Beast and The Giant  gotta love it
How the hell has Eddie gotten this far without understanding how bodybuilding works.  It's not about "stopping an inch from the end" it's about not pushing/yanking the bar with 100% effort and instead putting constant effort in.  I understand he's only ever trained strongman but how can you not know the literal only important difference from strongman to bodybuilding
please do powerlifting instead of bodybuilding
dont bulk no need man
if your son keeps training with you he might become the hulk or something kid will be hella strong
@EddieHall hit up CT Fletcher & Mike Rashid for the best body building pump and content ever!
This is the best video I have seen of nick walker
love seeing Eddie and Max together
What's the diet looking like?
Imagine max in 5 years. 💪💪💪
Poor kiddo. He is going to have a rough time just to become the strongest in the family.
When you have one of the most powerful bodies in the world it shows a real level of commitment to make it a designer bod. Good luck Eddie
Its cold
Eddie where is his gym? Looks like one I've trained at in Nottingham??
If eddie gets shredded and I m the same then I gonna quit my youtube 😂 keep working hard
Can't train heigh LOL🤣
Don't Bulk
There is literally nothing for eddie to gain by bulking another 30lbs by april.
These bodybuilding techniques are so outdated.
someone really needs to tell eddy his head and neck are too fat for body building.
E-Bum is here
You're still so full of yourself
Eddie's got a long way to go to be in a bodybuilding contest big difference between strongman and bodybuilding and Eddie likes to eat, what in the world is he gonna do when its time to starve to get cut for a bodybuilding show the way he likes to eat I would hate to be his wife LOL cause he's got a lot of discomfort ahead of him in his journey to become a bodybuilder! GOOD LUCK EDDIE AND FROM HERE ON OUT KICK ASS !!💪✌
Amazing stuff …it would be awesome to see some old school work with Dorian Yates as well.
I've known Jamie since school, he's just a f**King good dude, always has been, and his wealth of knowledge is incredible, hope the shits have cleared up!
11:11 Eddie smoking hahah
I'd love to see you try Bojutsu with a 3, 5 and 10 lb bo staff, I started adding it in twice a week in between my calisthenics and resistance bands routines, really ignites you, good way to break past plateau, just throwing out a different idea, keep up the hard work brother
Max will be an absolute monster when he gets older
Max is looking good, future WSM no doubt
Very entertaining video Eddie, keep up the top tear content man
I don't know if it's just for the camera but Eddie just doesn't seem to really listen to what he's being told. It's like he listens, then immediately forgets it and does it his own way anyway 🤔  That being said, I'm still really interested in following this journey with Eddie
if i could give more than 1 tumbs down for attitude i woudld do so
'Managing health' aka off the peds lol. great vid tho
ah max is a fine lad. good to see you bring max to the gym with you. keep going max. looking beast
Got to say it's great watching you transition to bodybuilding you have MASSIVE potential to sculpt a great physique I'm looking forward to seeing you get the results you crave go team beast 👍
Broooooooo edddie you can see the fuck second generation coming that physique is forming hard af
Its so cool to see father n son on this journey together .
did he pick up a spoon for breakfast?
^-^🖤
11:09 how cold must it be in that gym, that Eddie is literally steaming after that set?
hey Eddie reach out to dorian will be amazing
Where the fuck have you Eddie come up with the idea that bodybuilders don't train with a wide range of motion? Some don't, sure, but those ones are a bit mentally challenged. Wide range of motion = good.
Every gym should be this cold!!! It’ll keep the asshats out that where next to nothing
Eddie...love that you are sharing this ride with Max. What wonderful memories and time with your boy.
Please someone get  Eddie in contact with Mike Israetel.
I'm rooting for you guys...keep it up
I used to love doing a slow controlled session, feeling the burn. Great video Eddie and can’t wait to see the progress
cut will be insane
I believe in you Eddie!
This is very motivating stuff. How Eddies showing how down to earth he is with going from the top of one game and daring to start at the bottom of another. Be good to see his transformation 👍🏻
Eddies guna smash it as a body builder 💪
DONT BULK!
All natural
Your known everywhere I was told about your videos definitely a inspiration to start my channel ✨🙂
Dam how cold is it in there look at the steam coming off there heads
So awesome to see max hitting weights with his dad 👍👊
Dude your still young when will we see u again in competition at worlds strongest ?
Max, in my opinion, will surpass his dad in strength and world records. He literally has the best coaching training equipment, food, diet, motivation, and financial support. The world's strongest man better look out for max in like 10 years if that's the life he decide to pursue
My seated row is 585 pounds
Reps with my PB. 🤷🏻‍♂️😒
Great combo. You two would be a formidable duo in an anime action scene for sure. haha Also want to say i think it's super cool of you to bring your kid and show him the ropes and let the people you train with show him some technique and training things. That kind of experience is what so many kids need these days.
Max carried this vlog
I might have a go at strong man, 5'8" 70kgs 38 years old and not very mobile! 😁
O
All big bodybuilders are on STEROIDS and Eddie hasn’t even mentioned it……..
please have greg ducette coach you.
Eddies gotta get a gym pin lol
👍💪 TIME  IS FOR TRANSFORMATION. GO EDIE.🏋️‍♂️🏊‍♂️🚵‍♂️🏃‍♂️🙋‍♂️🧠
Give it a few hrs Gregg douchette will do a video on this 🤣🤣🤣
It's cool you're doing this but you're going to be the worst looking on stage
More with the kid in it. Little beast is gonna be amazing.
Who wants to see The BEAST x CBUM video??
E-Bum hahaha
If you want to bodybuilding you have to have low body fat.  Eddie Hall is putting on a fat instead 🤦‍♂️
Eddie is waaay to fat to even began to start a flexing routine.
13:26 jamie the giant is smoking
You the man Eddie ! Effin' awesome ! So much fun watchin ur vids bro !
Such an impressive gym and great watching Eddie's introduction and journey into bodybuilding 👍💪
I met this guys dad! He was breakdown recovery and showed me pictures of jamie
Casual second gear xD 11:10
Makes me wanna start training again.! 😎😎💪💪👊👊
I mean, you have enough muscle, just lose fat? More cardio is needed
I've seen many egolifters in my life but I've never seen an egobuilder before, nice to see something new in the Bodybuilding sports.
Seriously, what is the temperature in there being that we can see your exhales?
Why is he bulking, the man is already 370 pounds, if he started cutting now he would be a tank at 280/290 pounds.
I miss the thanos intro ngo
Lol 😂 if Eddie gets any bigger be shuffling sideways through his house
Love you man, big fan for a long time. But bulking will damage your body further and be less benifitial than maingaining or cutting.
00:02 ek aur!
Drop sets for junk volume and stupidity 🤡
E Bum lmao
Eddie, idk how to tell ya this........but you're kinda chunky
Dude is 370 pounds and 30% bf and wants to bulk....😑
I can see his head steaming at the end 😳 😆😂
train light and eat less eddy, you already have a lot of muscle just trim the fat
Dude's maxing out his stats at this point. An inspiration to me.
Max is going to be a total sud.
He didn't listen to Greg then when he said don't bulk
You can see their aura
Could not hit the gym for three years because of a broken spine und nerve damage... this video makes me burn and kicks my motivation up af
Would be interesting to see eddie do some super slow reps and concentrate on the negative after a "power" set. To feel the difference. Great stuff guys. 👏
imagine cbum with eddie it would be great
Jesus he is smoking
14:02 Eddi trained so hard, that he starts smoking XD
Big rami? Big love the beast! We’re going to the Mens open baby
GG bro a lot of haters here thinking that bodybuilding is something bigger than powerlifting, believe me the way you look won't help you against strength but it's good to show off
Inspiring love frm india
Bodybuilding was 100% what Max needed to calm him down!
Eddie, so many of the juiced up boys are talk smacking against you.... I am 5000% with you and just hope you shit their fucking mouth
Get advice from somebody that can win shows.nathen de asha
You need to lose the weight you don't need to gain wain't awake I didn't understand when you said at the end you're gonna gain I thought you were gonna gain muscles you could gain the muscles so you need to lose the weight you can see more your 6 pack if you lose the weight  Body builders have less weight and more muscles
So how much gear is Jamie taking in comparison to Eddie?
It's nice seeing caylum moger out running about again!!btw, if Eddie had problems with dehydration before bodybuilding is really going to knock him on his ass.
You cannot hide if you're doing work or not in that gym lol
I don't understand why he would need to bulk, when your over 20% body fat you don't need to be a caloric positive, it will take for ever to cut to under 10% if he does that.
11:08 Bro worked out so hard, he's steaming...
EDDIE, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE DONT BULK! You're already at a big weight. What you need to do now is start training and begin building muscle, muscle. Not strength muscle. You've already got tons of that. Any more weight, and you're gonna make yourself very ill. No more weight, Eddie. Please?
TRAIN WITH JORDAN PETERS AKA TRAINED BY JP!!!! HE IS THE GOAT IN THE UK
Do full rom, stop this constant tension nonsense
His growth guy and gyno are far to bad
He needs to train with cbum
Crazy recpect for beast
Big love for the beast but I do wonder if he can really cut down as much as a bodybuilder
bloody love seeing max train with his old man
Lots of sweating going on in that cold gym 😂😂😂😂😂
Key points. Momentum is the enemy!!! Always hold max flexion for two seconds (every rep) to stop rebounding. Record 1/2 reps to accurately monitor progress , and is a great mental hack when " going for it" (hormonal stimulation...adrenaline >>> testosterone) Intermittent fasting and a carnivore diet.  Based on 45 years of multi gym ownership and p.t. ing.
Training with one of the best.  I'm excited to see your transformation Eddie.   Keep killing it brother
Eddie "The Steam-Engine" Hall 😎
Eddie needs to train with Dr Mike from renaissance periodization
Slower the better , you build muscles that you have 100% control of !
Will try some of this next time at the gym, nice one 👍
Those blue 20kg plates are so skinny!
It makes sense that Max is strong being Eddie’s son but it’s still crazy to see.
Don't bulk eddie. Start your cut ASAP and I mean ASAP. You have enough mass from bodyfat to build a good base from. Adding more mass from bodyfat will cause long term health problems. Don't you already sleep with a breathing mask ?
Watched the vid last night went to gym today took on board all I learned and had an amazing session thank you to you both
Baby Beast is already stronger than most adult women
You already bulked, it's time to maintain or cut
please do a video with Mike Israetel from renaissance periodization
What is that cold weather in the gym?
Yes ! Come on E-bum! Love to see the journey
Dont bulk
No one:  Eddie : that's it headbutt the weight!
This guy looks like his chewing is full of roids😂
Max on his Space Hopper!  😅
Yujiro Hanma vs Toppo
Ilson!
That thumbnail both them didn't look good at all
@Eddie Hall The Beast I would love to see you work out with Phil Heath. I think you could learn a lot from him.
Why does his kid look just like Tom Stoltman tho?
wish u all the best and hope u will look like Markus Rühl one time
Eddie's taking this bodybuilding training techniques really seriously, massive respect for that 💪
I wonder how hard it is going to be for Eddie to put on muscle mass considering he is so conditioned and so strong for the mass he already has
Jamie is the man.  Great episode!
I wonder who his coach will be an what is sack will be ?
were not even 5 seconds in and u saw his head smoking
You dont need to bulk. Lose all of that fat and then post a video.
Please watch Gregg’s videos on why you shouldn’t bulk!!!
If your going compete its your waist thats going be the issue as youve got a blocky waist....
Don’t bulk see what you have got to work with first, it the hardest part to do. Cut , cut , cut
Please do not bulk. Love you but your fat Eddie. You can easy build muscles and still loose a lot of your fat
Anyone else notice how Jamie's ROM got progressively more shit each set on the cluster lmao
former worlds strongest man
Insane body
jesus how cold was that gym? you can see your breath leaving clouds hahaha
Have you noticed that Eddie or Brian never talk about using gear.   Now that Eddie is bodybuilding, let’s hear the gear talk.   Lol
Edward, are you staying hydrated?
He's thinking of bulking??? He should be slowly cutting.
Shame Jamie closed this gym for his personal use, was the best around here for sure
Listen to Greg
I'd like to make a suggestion next time your in America if its not already been suggested go and train with Charles Glass the Godfather of bodybuilding
Please don't fuckin bulk. Listen to Coach Greg!!!
DONT BULK EDDIE PLEASE
Eddy and Jamie opening the 8 gates
Max is gonna mog all your records in the next couple decades Eddie. That's gotta be a good feeling.
Eddie I have been following you for years so when I say this I want what's best for you.  DO NOT BOLK!!!  You have to start losing weight now. Listen to the experts like Greg doucette and bodybuilding BS. They have some harsh words for you, but they want you to succeed.
Ничего не понятно очень интересно 😅
Eddie please don’t bulk your already huge
How come you find soooo many yes men, who agree with all your shitty ideas and never give you an honest advice.  Listen you already are bulked up, you don't need anymore bulking. Start eating clean and improve your physique.  You will do as good in bodybuilding as good a boxer you were.
Bro when i see someone steaming like that i get motivated bro 😂😂
Eddie's favorite muscle to mention is definitely rhomboid. Nobody works their rhomboids like Eddie.
Eddie looks like hes gonna explode
Eddie Pudzianowski
I was shocked Eddie was struggling with just 20kg on the T-bar row, then realised there were about 5 plates on there…….built different
now remember that there is a positive phase and a negative phase when you have to build muscles, work with the weight both ways 🦧
Stay off the Rice Krispie Squares... I used to love them too.. They are full of Crap!
Eddie you are still using your strongman techniques quite a bit. Perfect form and no movement of the body to help pull the weight, you can still see you body rocking on every exercise. Don't get me wrong I cant do any of this but your form is quite a way off the giants form.
He doesn't need to bulk he needs to cut.
Mate his son must have been pissing you off… he’s just there like a bad smell and to make things worse they both don’t listen
Always have cocopops for desert :)
I’m not sure what you trying to accomplish but your build look silly
Max has god strenght compared to his classmates
I want to see eddie train with jordan peters
All those weights and no heater!  Let me Guess no air conditioner either.  WTF
Greg, get this man a workout program
Eddie's on some powerful gear there.
It’s really not different except the reps and rest. If your ‘bodybuilding’ and making more noise, then it’s the aerobic aspect (the cardiovascular aspect).  Eventually, it’s easier and you’ll feel better overall.
The BEAST? More like the whale 🤣
jamies a lovely bloke
Seeing this man in bodybuilding is just insane and it's so great
Funny how I actually prefer Eddie's thicc aesthetics over the typical shredded bodybuilder look. He carries his size so much more healthily it really shows. His overall size fits his strength much better
Can we all appreciate the super sayajin aura they've got rising from their heads and shoulders all through the workout
Pas certain mais je pense qu'il manque de chauffage 😂🤣😂🤣
Man you need to workout with Dorian Yates  Then you will see what bodybuilding is all about.
This steam coming out of them both is a real indicator of a proper workout
the steam coming off of Jamie at 19.20 😂
💪💪💪💪💪
I'd watch these daily Eddie! This is such a sick crossover. Fucking go lad proud of you buddy. You're an inspiration.
Roids. Ugh, disgusting bodies.
bro is steaming
I'd love to see Eddie train with dr. Mike Israetel over at renaissance periodization!
Two giants bullying the iron
Mark Bell the powerlifter did a bodybuilding transformation like this and he did quite well, it will be interesting to see how Eddie does
Dorian. Yates.
I would like to see you take a leg workout with Dorian Yates
jeeeesuss help max a bit more with his form and lower it with a bar or two....  love ur videos no matter what✌👏
smoke coming of ur head when u posing
Slower reps eddy slower reps 🦾😁
Need to see a collab with James hollingshead🤞🏼
11:10 You overloaded Eddie. His cooling system is working at maximum capacity
"15 I don't think I've counted that high in my life" Also Eddie: Benches 2 plates for 44 reps
Eddie really doesn't need to gain back to 400 just to build muscle. He can easily maintain at 360 and then cut. Much healthier and probably more effective approach, because he's gonna have to do a massive cut at 400 and will likely end up losing more muscle because of it
Quiza y no vaya ayudar mucho los tatuajes, ya que el culturismo se ve más esa calidad de definición. Pero hombre, Eddie te verás realmente brutal una vez que llegues a esa calidad de un culturista
your kid is gonna be the strongest man in the world someday
One day soon Max will be making noises and flexing in the mirror. 💪
I love how Eddie acts like a kid more than his son does lol
Max's GPP is going to be unreal when hits 16-18. Could definitely see him in the Olympics for shot put or wrestling when he's older.
Fantastic informative workout video 👌🏼🙌🏼 thanks Eddie!
with love from Ukraine🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦💪💪💪💪💪🤘🤘🤘🤘🤘
An excellent posting, loved the coaching you gave each other chasing the extra reps. Both great mentors to Max by including him in your workouts. Would love to see more like this.
Love you working out with your son! Great to see a father teaching and encouraging his son to be manly.  (Please dont bulk, last thing you need)
Can't wait to see the final result. And I just KNOW you'll look amazing because you never quit!
this should have been callled (eddie hall vs roids)
This is the perfect challenge for Eddie. You know he’s going to apply himself to it 100% like he does everything and the results are sure to be phenomenal!
bros steamin
Bro you can see the cold on his breath. Turn the fucking heat on lmao
I think Eddie would benefit from stretching daily. Maybe yoga, which involves a lot of stretching.
Good luck Ed..  me personally, not a fan of the bodybuild look
I’m really really enjoying this bodybuilding journey mate great videos and knowledge 💪👍👍
How cold is it in that bloody gym?! All I'm seeing is condensation 😤💨😆
On the seated rows, what's the difference between the grips you guys are using? Overhand vs underhand?
Great looking Gym
21:08 Eddie is just at a Jillion Degrees, look at all the steam
Jamie turn some heat on.  The steam rolling off you guys is distracting. 🙂
Painful to watch him “bodybuilding” training. Just goes to show, you can be amazing in 1 field and fairly useless in another, even if it seems like a similar field
what happened to that young lad Eddie took on when he was boxing?
Hows the condensation breath after drinking the cranberry!! Must be freezing in there hahaha
Slow and smooth, not power ed👍
Eddie if you train with Tom Platz I will die a happy man.
Bodybuilding is about illusion. Eddie has a thicker waist. To offset that, he needs a distracting level of 3D-detail and thickness in his back, round, capped delts, and thick chest. More importantly, his legs need to grow quite a bit. I mean, they're already big, but they need to be massive. All the while keeping his waist the same or a little smaller and learning to perfectly control it. High volume hack squats ,vertical leg press and walking barbell lunges.
I remember Eddie's first tv strongmans he looked like zangeif from street fighter
The amount of steam from Eddie is insane 🤯
Eddie, have you ever thought of trying Bouldering? That would be epic to see how you would get on.
Please don't go to 400lb. Start cutting now mate.
Push up and pull ups are really good for stretching your muscles under tension.. Will be hard for a big lad like you but I promise it will help shape that chest up and impove your range of motion massively. Wish you all the best on this new adventure and we all know you can do it 100% 💪
Is it just me or did Eddie got a lot bigger ? :o
Man I'm so happy that you are doing it. It's gonna be epic how you gonna look after let's say a year or so of straight bodybuilding training :) man you are so fckn big !
feel sorry for teenagers taken up bodybuilding nowadays,  they don't have the correct advice from the d 40s and 50s and 60s and 70s, they don't have  Legends like Vince Gironda /Arnold Schwarzenegger/Mike Mentzer to show how to train,  sorry Jamie Johal the demonstration and the workout there wasn't hardly any full range of movement,   people still don't know how to do a seated row
Great watch gents.. love this..
The steam coming off you in that place 🤣
Losing that fight was probably the best thing that happened to Eddie. He’s so chilled and fun to watch. Seeing him start as a novice in a new sport really showcases his work ethic. Great vid.
positive static negative its not about weight
Nice video, but now in bodybuilding, what do you eat now and how many calories, defizit or not ?
Another YouTuber Eddie could collab with is Jonni Shreve. I know he's American but still.
This cut is gunna be fucking crazy 😂
Really interesting video Ed. Can definitely see the difference in form between you both.
Cbum workout when?
Your boy is gonna take your deadlift record by the time he is 18. That kid can lift damn and hes got the best trainer
Can see the difference already. Looking forward to following this journey
F$%k me Eddie man. i've got the DOMS just from watching this.  =
With that huge core section, Eddie will never be able to look like  a Bodybuilder.
Traps are missing
Okay
Awesome guys this is going to be epic
The "giant" dudes body looks fucking vile
The hardest thing for Eddie will be the diet
two roid heads lol
what happened to pinhead and the lanky boxer you sponsored?
Really good video. Long way to go to be like Jamie. Itll be interesting to see how Jamie does strong man training
Looks like the sets reverted back to strongman style towards the end of the session lol.
Learning a lot from these videos. Cheers guys! 👍🏻
We’ll explained difference between strong man technique and bodybuilder technique 👍🏼 look forward to seeing how far Eddie can get wit it
Can Eddie fix his saggy chest and slim down his waist slightly? Or will he always look like a meatball with gyno?
Better without the kid ed
I always used to say a lifter tries to make a rep easy...... A bodybuilder tries to make a rep hard. 😉
Eddie, within the first two mins I can see/hear that you are getting it. It's a different mind set, yes? Well done.
Do you really need to bulk Eddie?
Dude is literally steaming after a set :D
Eddie is one of the most impressive humans in history. Just super-human power and endurance. He can also swim like a dolphin, just ridiculous.
Sorry, you never get used to a hard leg day... inho.
Roid boys team up
Another great video Ed and love that Max is well into it. But my honest thoughts are if you bulk upto 400lbs it will be very hard work to condition. But that’s just my thought I respect and wish you all the best on your journey 💪🏻💪🏻
I’m super intrigued to see what your abdomen is going to look like stage ready, most body builders seem really thin there.
Why is it so cold in that gym? I can see their breath.
You can actually see steam coming off these guys
Great vidio
He’s torn muscle’s alot, curious to see how it looks when he’s lean….
What are the trainers that max is wearing they look nice can’t lie
go and train with dorian yates
Again, Eddie, you don't need to go to 400,too much fat to diet off and makes you diet way longer,that said,Eddie you are packing alot of muscle,when you get lean,you are actually going to look bigger with shredded muscle.
Loving this series 👌
Jamie should do Eddie's diet since he's  a 300 pounder.
Eddie should meet up with the Dutch giant, Olivier Richters. (2.18m 7’2ft)
🤔
Love how Eddie is literally streaming😂
May Allah Guide you in Islam, you are a Good man
This is such a great series and please don't stop. Love watching it.
Great video and learned new things. Look forward to following ur journey into bodybuilding.
Eddie is smoken
Trouble is Eddie how the bloody hell are you gonna trim down your core to develop a small waist your abs are the size of a 3 piece suit
You know that the gym is cold when you are working and  literally steaming
Eddie at The Olympia!!! Can't wait!!
You can see their breath gotta be chilly in there
I'm not sure it's an easy transition to make - strongman to bodybuilder - specifically because there's certain things the strongman life DOES to the body - like that big strongman gut - visible abdominals yes, but distended (hormones, maybe?) - that I don't think can be undone. I could be wrong but I think it'd be next to impossible to bring that in again. We'll see - should be an interesting journey! Also I agree - I don't think 400 lbs is necessary - you have plenty of weight to cut already to get all shredded so ballooning up shouldn't be needed with your mass you already have. Great thing is, you have ridiculous calves which is something a lot of bodybuilders struggle with. Honestly though, you SHOULD if you can do a video with ARNOLD. Good god man. Imagine THAT. Bodybuilding tips from Arnold himself? FUCK yeah. If any man on this planet understands how to CORRECTLY proportion the IDEAL physique it is the guy who had the EPITOME of the ideal muscular male physique in his prime. He may be older now but that doesn't mean he doesn't still KNOW how to do it.
Good video.
love that you are doing this but you need to tell the guys that train you to comment on your technique its really important. on the row you holder over when he holds under and you are to explosive so the strong man muscles kicks in, you can push every weight there no problem but you are not controlling anything, ye the pause top and bot is good but you need to think that you are flexing and draging things with the only muscle you want to hit, say bicep curls, if you take a light weight and pull in and lock your shoulder when you flex just your bicep the weight comes up and not fast flexing/contracting takes a sec, if you think of curling it by just lifting normal you use your shoulder and tricep and some chest and everything really, thats why we cheat when we come to that point of failure cus that one muscle you are training is giving up so more muscles are jumping in to help get it up and that is not what you want. stong man is boom get the heavy weight up doesnt matter how or which muscel is being used, bodybuilding leave your ego at home and lift some medium/light weights and contracting only dont think about how to get like your shoulder up to your face just flex one muscle in the shoulder and the arm goes up almost by it self. lifting your arm over head you use your forearm elbow and alot of other muscles but you can get it over by just contracting the front and side delt, you dont need to use your whole arm but it makes it easier for everyday use but you are in the gym bro
This journey is already interesting to see the huge difference between bodybuilding and strongman training. lookin forward for all the vids that will come.
This is such a cool gym
This made it abundantly clear that when Eddie lifts weights he does so with his full body but when Jamie lifts he does so with the targeted muscle
Nice watching little beast trains
I don't think Eddie's left leg would make the weight cut off for Classic Physique haha
9:55 overhand vs underhand? 🙂 Great content!
Fuck men train him legs let his ars burn 😂😂
Check that intro! Dude looks like fucking ghost rider 😂
Now we wait for the greg g video of everything you have done *in his voice* wrong wrong wrong
In the cold btw.
I still have ball tap anxiety for eddie when max is stood next to him and its not even my sack
I feel like you will get the Olympia, I don’t know why
@13:10 lmao "that one you feel it lats/mid back cause we pull it low"  Eddie: "to the chest"   Come on body builder. You gotta give the guy proper instructions.  He was overhand pulling to his chest. He hit rear delts and traps.  "The giant" should've told Eddie to pull palms up and toward his balls so he actually hit the intended muscle.  Now he's doing t bar which he'll do for rear delts/traps again
@9:30 why is letting Eddie do rows with the wrong grip? You get more lats with palms up. Eddie ends up doing upper back instead of lower lats
With the steam coming off the beast he looks like he is going Super Sayan
You can almost hear Greg Doucette screaming at this video “you don’t need to bulk to 400lbs” 😂
You should train with Dr.Mike from Renaissance Periodization
can't wait to see the cut
Eddie’s a kid at heart ! Love it . STROngest!!
Really interesting
Eddie, please try and get in touch with Dorian Yates!! He's another Brit who has done it all! He would be glad to train ya, I presume.
Hopefully we'll see more of these guys together moving forward! Dudes are literally steaming lol
Jamie the Giant seems like a proper nice bloke 👍🏻
The guy who done the photoshopped thumbnail needs sacking...🤣🤣🤣
Greg  Doucette is going to be posting any moment now about Eddie's insane bulking to 400 pounds then cutting.
What do u and max drink during your workouts curious
mans steaming more than a fucking microwaved potato
Must be really cold there,  you can see the steam coming from the bodys @13:21
You're still lifting like a strongman even tho you say you're paying attention to Jamie. You must drop weight and slow them reps down.
Legend still training
Enjoying the vids ,, going to follow to the end👍
how cold is the room you can see their breathe
Where are his socials? Should be in the description!
I like that Eddie is sporting the Mr Beast merch
Eddie 'E-Bum' Hall
I just know the coach is going to cover this harder than last time
I love the father son workouts.
anyone else see the steam coming from eddie
Eddie Hall, thank for doing this. One is glued to one’s seat.  Yours sincerely, Jay
Good teacher and good studient. Really like to see what is coming. Eddie you always will find the best help for you.
You should try cosplay as Kratos man :)
Very nice to see the comparison between bodybuilding a strong man 💪
Looks like he is gonna do it, just can't wait to see future Eddie hall
Is that  heat coming from Eddie's body? 😳
So did someone invent a new Mr. Fat Ass competition.  If so, I think we've go a winner.
2 things I noticed, Eddie used a pronated grip on the machine rows, Jamie used a supinated grip, and Eddies RoM was massive compared to Jamie on the single arm cluster set on the sitting row machine ? No idea which is better, but they must make a difference ?
Good Workout Eddie..
19.03 onwards .. steam coming off jamie 😅
ELLO YUCHUB 0:07 @naturalhypertrophy1925
i really need to get back in the gym
Terrible way to train for anyone not taking PED’s. Not hating just transparency, you spend all your time in the muscle endurance rep range you’re not going to progress unless you’re taking something.
Acc love how involved Ur son is with the series
eddie you should work with Mike Van Wyck for your bodybuilding journey
Mad how string max is for 10 year old
"stomach issues won't go into graphic details" ah yea I remember why I like the British so much
E-Bum on the rise
I thought you should maximize the stretch on top? and not stop it an "Inch" before top?
Hopefully he can diet away those tit flaps
Please do not bulk up, start cutting right away. It's just a waste of time. You're already bulked up.
No seriously how cold is it in that gym ?
When did the police release you from custody after running over that car?
Im more interested in his diet aspect
The giant has a great physique, his neck looks small compared to his frame though
I want to see Ebum shredded to the bone!!! COME ON EDDIE
He sounds like Ned Stark, Sean Bean lmao
It must be so cool for you Eddie after so much you have done and accompish feeling like a novice again  ( a monster novice in your case)
HAIRY BEAST !!!😋
11:08 Visible dehydration emanating from that thirsty chap.
But he's not a giant is he? He's certainly well above average but he isn't 7ft+ like Olivier Richters the Dutch bodybuilder, that qualifies as a giant.... 6'5" in comparison isn't giant, just well above average
Eddie mate, you don't need to bulk, you're already a bulk! Start shredding down in a small deficit.
Great collaboration Jamie is a top bloke
the way eddie is steaming looks dope like he is on fire🔥🔥
Nice seeing that you keep bringing Max with you to the gym. I had an amazing father and can't complain, but seeing someone be active with their son warms the heart. Keep it up big man and big man junior!
Is this Eddie Hall's own channel?
Eddie thray bjj
11:11 Eddie is a Titan confirmed, look at that vapor
15:36 Eddie is smoking bruv
love how the steam just comes from Eddie halls, after working out for for a  while :P
19:00  steaming 🔥
Finally some new gym content. It’s what Eddie does best
Cool to see eddie is learning allot from this session!
Lol I started bodybuilding as a beginner at the beginning of this year. I'm 3 weeks in now, but my very first leg day I got woken up in the middle of the night when I went to roll over and my poor, sore jelly legs cramped up all along the back of my thighs. Don't think I've ever woken up so fast lmao.
Great vid, but I fear that this journey is going the same way as the boxing one - Eddie didn't seem to be paying attention to controlling the weights at all. And 400lbs then cut?? He's already bulked. Just cut now and work on the details!  If there's any bodybuilders in the comments, feel free to correct me.  I just get the feeling that Eddie is afraid of losing mass/strength which is why he didn't cut for boxing and he won't cut much for this. Would love to be proven wrong.
Just out of curiosity - no hate - I really know know or any better: would this be the „right“ or „most optimal“ way to do Pulldowns as a Bodybuilder ? It just looks like a strength movement because of the „body English“ / momentum. Or should I also do my sets like this if I want to become big?
Really enjoyed this content Eddie! Keep it up! Maybe you can get down to London and train with the Shed?
Eddie you was smoking🤣😂🤣 👌🏽
Look at 11minutes 10 seconds you can see the heat coming off his body it must be really cold in there
Jamie is so chill and has a great temperament !
Eddie if you really get leaner after your body building journey, you will look like kratos from god of war, im telling you if there will ever be a movie about this get it
11:09 the steam on Eddie🤣
Eddie Hall  technique is sucks ...that's not how you should train for bodybuilding
Hello Eddie, Luke again. I don't know if you saw my first comment, but I am looking for tips on bodybuilding. I know your new to the bodybuilding mindset, and want to hear your view on it. I have been lifting constantly for 2 months now and have put on a bit of muscle. I am 5' 8" 200lb and wanted to know what benefits you the most as far as eating and lifting. One love, thanks Max and Eddie.
Just the fact that Max is able to observe his Father be humble enough to listen intently to another man's advice is a valuable lesson for him. I like that a lot;))
Just dont use what these body builders are doing, like steroids and psd's. Lets see what youll look within a year
Eddie moaning it's cold then spent the session walking round like a kettle
My learning from these videos… power lifters fuck weights up and body builders are fucked by the weight!
I love this content! But, I don't think cranberry drink or similar is a very good source of hydration... is it? Baby steps, I guess 😁
i know what muscle area pull exercises are hitting when u are at the most extent position of stretch , u feel the fibres strain
💪💪❤❤👍👍🔥🔥
20:39 Close your eyes, and just listen
19:00 The steam that comes out of Jamie while he talks looks like the Dragonball z character
Alternate Title: Two Houses Posing
Eddie, not all athletes make good coaches.  Unless you are only doing these kind of videos for more views and are not really trying to get in bodybuilding, please consider getting a more reputable bodybuilding coach.  Even though Jamie Johal is very impressive bodybuilder you should consider a coach with real winners,  someone like Hany Rambod, Chris Aceto, or Matt Jansen.  If even half social media guy and coach why not Greg Doucette?
Someone needs to help get Eddie on BB&B!
Really interesting to see Eddie's "A to B" habits here compared to bodybuilders like Dorian Yates who are all about that slow controlled movement.
Max at 9:19: really? Everytime?
11:22 look how eddie is smoking after the set bruh⚡️
Hey Eddie. Just wanna tell you inspired me to go into bodybuilding this year, too! I've done crossfit and powerlifting, and mostly I do lean bulking. But this year I want to bulk! So inspiring to see someone who is already good at something let go and challenge themselves. Thumbs up!
Realistically, The Giant won the pose off, BUT DAME BEAST, 2 weeks and you've already changed your body so much!  I don't workout, Hell, I hardly move; but I have been watching WVERY video since you said you were taking body building on. I'd say I am inspired, bc I am, but not personally. I am inspired as to what mankind are capable of. I will never be fit. Lol
Eddie,you look amazing!!!!
great vid. can you post workout?
Clearly it is freezing cold in that gym... Looks like they are smoking
The fact that we can see your breath hahaha
if max does even half the work he is gonna end up stronger that 99% of humans let alone kids his age!
dude its badass seeing the steam coming off of them after they work out
You need to train with cbum
Nice of Eddie to look after Tom Stoltman's lad
Imagine your dad being the world’s strongest man🤣
Fuckin Borat towards the end 😆
"HE DOESN'T NEED TO BULK, IT’S EDDIE HALL!!!!"
As Greg Doucette's mentioned, you don't need to blow up to 400lbs, you can easily get shredded from the weight you are now. Really enjoying this journey you're on, regardless how cliched that word sounds these days, learning a few new things myself. Best of luck, Eddie!
Should train with James Hollingshead next
Eddie turning into the colossal titan
Look at the steam on eddies head
Eddy 💪👍
WAIT WAS THAT DOOM PLAYING IN THE BEGINNING ON A DIFFRENT TONE?
You can see Jamie bite his tongue when Eddie mentioned shooting back to 400lbs... its a bad idea, trying to force weight cut 100lbs+ to get 'in shape' when he has such a big frame already and fat%. If anything he should diet as is now and load proteins for muscle and do a clean bulk not go for a number which he knows he's capable. I feel this is a strongman thing... more size = more frame being able to move more weight, As he discussed in the video, its about time under load not how much you can move.  Good video none the less.
Headbut the weight!
You know ur training hard when there is smoke coming off you
Seeing the steam coming off of Eddie in that cold gym is crazy. He's literally a radiator
this was great!  thank you for making this.  It's inspiring!
Anyone else see the steam coming off him 19:15
Eddie, after a few sets you'll be glad the gym is that cold.
*I like how it's so cold they have mist flowing off of them*
What I find funny about the fact that Eddie said dark side is the fact that the guy that was actually on the set of the original Star Wars movies in the Darth Vader suit was British bodybuilding champion David Prowse
I watched the Giant on YouTube all the time
You just don’t have the shape for a men’s ‘beauty pageant’ Stick to strong man.
Eddie should train with Tom platz
I am following this because I'm on my own journey also. Never too late to start
how f-ing cold is it in that gym? blowing smoke while talking! put some heat on cheap bastards!
"taper"
Get Dorian Yates mate Hit the temple gym This needs to happen
You should try and do a training session with wesley vissers. I feel like you would really learn a lot from him when it comes to body building and give you lots of good tips on your journey
Eddie's head and shoulders are literally steaming
So wish I was. Eddie son ahha living. The dream going and lifting with dad yeah buddy haha
going to be an interesting journey.  Next week.. The Beast, vacuum pose!
Steam coming off them, cold gym and raised blood pressure, body heat activated. Jamie got Eddie pumped up.
My god eddie hall has got a massive gut. Pure musscle
remember guys look straight while doing sets so you dont pinch a nerve in your neck
boy is crooked
SLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW Eccentric
FULL STACK EDDIE
Eddie for your next upload would you do some rubbing baby oil into Big men with your little budgie smugglers on
That's like a freaking 50 set back workout. They would just have to cover me up with dirt because I would be dead for 3 weeks.
he might go pro!
Lost the bodybuilding aspect/control towards the end and went into powerlift mode, gotta keep reminding yourself of the control and contracting
Cbum? Jesse? Ronnie? Tom platz?🤭
Eddie can fling weights all day and not feel muscle pain.. but this he won't be able to scratch the back of his head🤣
Closest Eddie Hall gone come to an V shape is Sponge Bob 🤣🤣🤣
Day 1 of requesting Eddie to collaborate with Noel Deyzel.
You’re so humble I don’t think there is anything you don’t know about weight lifting but you listen like a student
Eddie please accept tates challange to bodybuilders an go kick his ass i agree with alot of his logic but the guys trippin if he thinks all bodybuilders are pussys
Maximus had some good pull form there on the rows
eddie stop drinking sweet drinks you must cut the sugar down XD
Can someone explain why Eddie drinks cranberry juice during workouts? Is there an advantage to this?
hit up dorian yates high intensity > volume is king
What I really like is seeing how much Max has improved in his lifting form and confidence,  with a dad like Eddie (and friends like Jamie), there's a crazy bright future for this kid! :)
Just goes to show the difference between Strongman and body building. He seemed fairly low key impressed at the work Eddie could do at weight. Strongman being less for looks and more about the work you can do with big weight... vs. Bodybuilding where the goal is more to build muscle for definition and esthetics.
Machines look so tiny when these giants are using them 😂🥹
Cut is gonna be insain
Since pretty much any weight you lift is gonna be light for you, why not try slower paused reps (5secs up, squeeze at the top for 2secs, lower for 5secs, no rest till the end of the set since the pause at the top is still an isometric squeeze)? I've found I can get a pretty good burn doing this only using less than half my usual weight for fast reps. I think it'll also help by forcing you to control the weight better.
You'll know Eddie's a true bodybuilder when he starts saying mind-muscle connection
It’s a privilege to be on this journey with Eddie
This bodybuilder didnt do 1 rep rep..Every one was a 3/4ths rep..lol
thx Eddie---- keep going we are routing for you
Come on Eddie keep the bodybuilding diet and training to see your transformation ❤
How about your tendon eddie?? Your hand tendon is not pain ?
It's like looking at 2x50 gallon drums wearing a human as a suit. I want to find Sasquatch will you guys help me look
The riff in the beginning of the video sounds like a rip off of The Only Thing They Fear Is You in doom eternal.
starting to look like a proper body builder man keep it up
I got a back pump from just watching.
Love to see you having some sessions with legends, like Yates,Coleman,cutler etc I know some will only be able to coach your session but it’d be a great in-depth session…. And maybe one with illya golem be funny seeing you look small for ones😂
eddie is the wolds strongest man? i agree. beware wold. i respect the fuck outta that deadlift you did. but wtf, you never went back to WSM? why?
Greg Douchett should be happy about this one lol.
Love the vids, your so inspiring, whats the warm down and recovery tips so that the miscles arent as tight and sore?
7:38 eddie's learning so much his head is steaming up lmao
Real motivational. But can we stop for a minute how these guys look like their steaming everytime the camera gets the right angle
Like how he is evaporating in that intro
You need to have Dr Mike from Renaissance Periodization train your legs, and shoulders
Eddies kid is stronger than i am XD
C-BUM VS E-BEAST MR O 2025
Do Whatever you want but request you not to use steroids
Eddie you don’t need to bulk to much to put on a lot of muscle. You already have a lot of muscle. You’re just gonna put on a lot of fat then when it comes to dieting you’re going to have a hard time keeping that muscle you gained.
Bugez & Beast?!!!!
Ebum 😂😂😂😂 Eddie i love your humor gtfo my stage Cbum.
Eddie dont bulk just get shredded
please stop with the little kid in video
Cant wait to see eddie on bodybuliding show
Would love to see Eddie train with Ben Pakulski. Extreme perfection of technique and see how much the weight moved drops
Seriously need to control that weight 🤨
Need to meet up and have Ronnie Coleman train you. That would be a great watch
Did Eddie started taking roids already or not yet ?
When I used to work for Papa Johns pizza I used to deliver to this guy, he’d order every week like twice- he could barely fit in his doorway when he answered🤣
Waiting for a greg video :P
Eddie needs to make a video with Jay Cutler
Cool to see the young lad joining in 👍👍👍 excited to see the results from both of you in the future
Am I seeing stuff or was Eddie and Jamie actually steaming?
Train with Dr.Mike from renaissance periodization to take it to the next level
You can literally see Eddie Dehydrating....LOL
Quality Eddie Jamie is a ledge
Does anyone else think it’s a little unreasonable for him to want to bulk up to 400 pounds? Surely that would mostly be fat at how big he already is. It would just leave him a lot more work to cut.
It will be interesting to see if Eddie can sculpt is body into that of a bodybuilders.   .o0
Your sweat marks look like the Bat signal
It's crazy i don't know what temp the room is but to be able to see the steam coming off them as their bodies heat up is nuts!
Eddie you should do a day in the life of as bodybuilder!! Eating day!!
I enjoy seeing you experience some new pain. It’s entertaining. Thank you
That's one beautiful gym. Would love to train there
Impressive Eddie doing it all natural
I'm so hyped about this journey man🔥🔥
With the strenght you have. If you trully focus on the tension and slowing down the concentric just a little bit more by lowering the weight, youll get a better stimulus 100% and get HUUUGGE
Your wife should have a channel I miss seeing her in the videos !
I know nothing about strong man or any strength sports but as a bodybuilding enthusiast and competitor eddy has potential out the wazoo I don’t think he will ever step on an Olympia  stage but I do believe if he brings his legs up and brings decent conditioning in he will have no problem winning a regional show and advancing to nationals(npc) and possibly getting his pro card depending solely on if he’s capable of creating illusion of an x frame AKA bringing up his legs and getting that waist tight
Eddie needs to work his legs the most overall
Eddie steaming
Yes sir,the more pro bodybuilders you can work with,the better🔥💪🏽
Id like to see Eddie train with Nick Walker🤯
🔥🔥
Yo,.....his fcking shoulders
I am loving your videos Mr Beast, you are a real inspiration
11:10 literal smokes coming out of him 🔥
This has to be a pathetic publicity stunt.
Peice of advice don't be like cbum. Your the beast. Be the beast. You got this.
I know Eddie's abs aren't great but he got etching to make them look more visible as it would be impossible to see them otherwise on that gigantic stomach
Get those arms huge Ed!
Watch out for Greg
Eddie hasn't lost a god damn pound yet since he became a bodybuilder lol
No need to bulk la
Can already feel the pounds melting off... keep on working hard. 💪
It must be freezing in that gym. I can see everyone's breath on exhaling. Great video and finally looks like a proper bodybuilding workout for the beast Eddie!
Eddie's tendons holding up.
His son is geting big
Shout out to max, he's doing great and has good form.
Eddie If u need to headbutt the weights mate take some plates off !!! U r not actually doing anything for your back ,you r not excusing or contracting the muscle u r just trying to lift the weight that’s it !!!
I think your son will take your deadlift record when his older. Very strong boy
18:56 jamie just going super saiyan
Eddie hall clueless about bodybuilding training n advising his son to bring his neck forward while doing Tbar rows unreal lol if he needs to use his neck to lift it ,it is too heavy mate !!! U have an IFBB pro bodybuilder n your ego Eddie is so big that u r giving him and your son advice 😂😂 what a clown !!!
I'm wondering why you didn't start training armwrestling ...
Hurts to be reborn, dunnit?
Love the steam coming from Eddie’s head at 1110
4:58 Eddie's kid is fucking better than Eddie
I love how max dose everything dad dose. And thanks to watching your videos I have started working out again
This is fantastic advice and the training has gotten a lot more purposeful/smart. Nice job, man! @gregdoucette
your boy is getting big.
Loving these collabs! You gotta hit up Mike Israetel too!
Biggest cut i ever lmao
Looking good Eddie and Max thank you for sharing this with us
I would follow coach Greg's advice and not bulk up any you are already a monster!
doesnt "original sin" punish innocent people?
Jamie is absolutely massive
if satan punishes bad guys, isnt he good?   seems like a big plot hole.
Eddie should go and train with a bunch of ifbb pros... Would be fun to see how each training differs
how many innocent children did god kill on Passover?   immagine worshipping such a monster
Am Ende des Videos sieht man wieso man Hubba Bubba nicht runterschlucken sollte,Max hat da wohl nicht mit gerechnet 😁😁😁
Max is gonna be an absolute tank when that teenage testosterone hits
You seem like your hooked Eddie can’t wait for the progress.
Need to do a video with Hanny for proper coaching
Jaime has the biggest hands I've ever seen!
Incoming bodyfat PR pending Eddie’s offseason bulk
11:05 wthf ?
Eddie smoking like he's about to go super saiyan.
Just understand, this is going to change fast twitch, to slow twitch. Don't expect the same from yourself, after you've switched your routine up. I'd not sign onto any boxing matches, is what I'm saying.
the heat radiating off his body looks insane
Greg Doucette is gonna burst a blood vessel I think.
I love these videos!
Love seeing the bond u have with your son teaching him the ropes !!!
Love this guy
Please stop touting yourself as the world's strongest man. That was like years ago. Stop griffting
Jamie's arms are hudge man. Eddie still talking about bulking after Greg Duciet and alot of others says he needs to start leaning out now. 🤔
Looking forward to see the cut man
Im excited to watch how Eddies body transforms with the change from powerlifting to body building
Get in touch with Paul Carter (liftrunbang), he's one of the best bodybuilding coaches in the world imo. He's constantly improving his methods based on the latest science and testing it out on his multiple 1000 members in Yoke Squad (men's training group) and Valkyrie (women's training group). As far as general population goes, his results are unmatched. If an "average Jo/Jane" can get such results, imagine how a guy with myostatin deficiency would fare lol
Would love to see Eddie train with @RenaissancePeriodization. That would be insane.
Gwon Max smashing it bro
Making good progress but still long way to go on really optimising form. Need to check out Mike van Wyck for sure
If you’re taking this as seriously as you’re putting out there then it’s worth collaborating with Mike Israetel FROM RP. He’s about as smart as it gets when it comes to bodybuilding.
Eddie please sort out working out with James Hollingshead!
Loving this series but smashing those weights down was giving me massive anxiety....but anyway Eddie is gonna be a tank at the end of this...awesome video...cant wait for the next.😁
Iam impressed by max
Max is drippy 🔥🔥🔥
what kind of gym is that??? cold as fuck, eddie blowing smoke through his mouth. Tear my shit in there hahaha
Link up with all the bodybuilders for content im sure they will all be happy to work with you 💪
Two great blokes here!
Cant wait to see you Eddie in proper bodybuilding shape! That's gonna be crazy! Wonder about juicing, is that gonna happen too? I guess
Hell yea happy you chose this path eddie this will motivate alot of people to get in shape with your informative videos. You are the talk of the town on all the body building podcasts prove them wrong you got this brother. Transformation eddie future mr o 2024 here we come
Must be cold in the Giants Lair... can see your breath. Awesome workout!
Jamie is quality!
I'm worried about Eddie's torn Biceps. TUT, negatives, posing etc. are going to put strain on the gun, that it's not used to. Hope Eddie warms up well.
Eddie is steaming so much after every set 💪🥶
Looks like your kid is getting strong.
love the content!
Oooo
11:08  Holy crap! Eddie is steaming! 😲 How cold is that room?
the worlds strongest jew
Why does he keep saying world's strongest man when he hasn't been worlds strongest man for 5 years? 🤷🏽
Love seeing Max getting involved!
11:09 Eddie is literally smoking.
Keep it UP Eddie :). Fingers crossed :) <3
You will be in great form on summer! Look how amazing strongman Krzysztof Radzikowski looks after quick bodybuilding training
What a pile of crap 🤮
Gotta tell ya Eddie this is a fantastic move , I’m super excited to see your transformation to body building !… your muscles will respond so well to the change … June/ July you will see huge change …
more videos like this with jamie lets do it!!
11:08 Homie is literally steaming
eddies dehydration entered the room
He doesn't need to bulk more??
A wonderful person, and I cannot describe Eddie in one word. He has a big dream and is based on accomplishing every day. He has a very wonderful book that talks about his life. I read his book well and enjoyed when I read it. His book contains ideas and things that you should learn from this book. Thank you, Eddie, for the information and advice that you give us. You are a wonderful, lovable and very humble person. Really, you are a legend. I am your follower from 2015 to this day. I learn a lot from you, and every day I learn more things. You are my teacher and everything. I love you so much, Eddie.💪🏻❤️‍🔥🌏🤞🏻
Your abs gonna be insane (Nohomo)
Bodybuilding means momentum is NOT used.
U can see how cold It is I there Jamie and Eddie has steam coming off of em after big sets. Much respect ✊
Do. Not. Need. A. Bulk..... 🤣
the steam!!!
His form still needs work though. The tempo is still set for strongman not body building.
I am not knowledgeable about these topics. Will he use steroids in this adventure?
I hope eddie pulls this off
Eddie you got 75!boddie fat you look a state mate
You don't need to bulk to 400
Amazing seeing the different style of training that Eddie is used to. Never really heard him squeal training for WSM.
His head’s literally steaming in the intro haha. That’s real hard work
Train HIT (High intensity training) with Dorian Yates Ed, £10 says you vomit first time. 🙂🙂🙂
Eddie already put on like 20 pounds of muscle from 2 bodybuilding workouts lol
cbum ain't ready
Max is going to become a beast. Imagine training with one of the World’s strongest men from so young.
no deadlifts on back day? not ideal for bodybuilding?
Genius doing more workout videos bc everyone’s covering Eddie’s training 😂 its gold! Gets so many views
Diamond stitched pads on the equipment!?  Jamie is fancy fancy
You needa be doing both the diet and the muscle building from the start. Get your mate Martyn Ford round and pick his brains
eddie dont bulk bro!
People are too quick to judge on the internet. Give him time to hit the form in all the exercises, he's shifted to bodybuilding for the duration of 2 weeks so far. He's a world level athlete, he'll learn in no time. Great video, great atmosphere, some people in the comment section should stfu and be a bit more encouraging. There is a lot for everybody to learn from this video by the giant.
Jamie the giant ? pretty sure Brian is taller , you are a beast Eddie , but how is Jamie a "giant" ? he's big yeah but no giant lol
anyone else feel like he could try controlling the weight a bit more? just curious to hear what everyone thinks
you got this big guy!
@11:10 Eddie is steaming like a fresh baked pie!
Next to Brian shW Jamie is a lil guy 😂
ive got £100 bet on u coming 2nd in mr olympia against my mate please win me £100 eddie
Eddie got so hot he started smoking lol
Eddie needs to do a single leg session with roley winklar
Anything above 10 reps is cardio...lol. Eddie is going to be about tree fitty.
Eddie is going to have a crazy six pack once he loses that weight.
Now imagine if Tom Platz teaches Eddie how he should train legs
Already time to power up that DIET
You should train with Ronnie Coleman! Would be a legendary video
Really happy for ya Eddie! Keep pushing hard, your inspiring many!
What about a belt???
Do they furnaces in Britain
Eddie was literaly on fire! He had smoke coming off of him 😂
He has Gyno  he has palumboism and he has a ton of loose skin. He will never not be last place on a competitive bodybuilding stage. It's cool that he's passionate about it but let's be real here
Awesome video. Jamie the giant and Eddie the beast hall training.
I’m 66 yrs old and want Eddie as my dad and training partner.  You are very blessed Max…make your dad proud
look at their breath in the beginning , are you training in negative degrees or what 😂
I think it was a full stack 😂
Loving the vids man!!
SUICIDE grip Ed, changes the game for back
Edie hall is an absolute BEAST he should be called ZANGIEF
Seems like a nice bloke
Eddie? Why is there smoke coming you're head? 11:11
Jesus Christ, this is going to be the greatest journey of all time. To see how eds shape has already changed in 3 videos is insane. This is better than the boxing series. I have not been in a gym for 5 years and have started again because of this. Big love TO the beast
My personal  preference is to get the full rep ROM but consciously contract them at the end.  If you think about how miserable the reps close to failure, then I know that my 1" from lockout easily becomes 2 inches... (otherwise known as 'man inches').  Even more so when it comes to triceps and glutes.
Would love to see a training session with Coach Greg ❤
with the amount of fat pad you have on your body, the amount of range of motion you have is going to be compromised. It's an illusion of strength for body building, training explosively isnt effective with partial range of motion but as you inch closer and closer to a regular body fat, you would be able to train more explosively again because you don't have the layer of fat stopping you from going all the way with it. On the pull or the push, and then the way down is always slower than the initial burst. people say that it can be overkill to do a rep tempo that is too slow. And you'd be right, except for these instances where that tempo is gained from intensity going into an exercise. So as you get deep into a set on an isolation, if you can get to a grinder on the last rep that's a good thing. You only need to pause reps a second atleast. But if you're doing the last rep that you can get out but it's a grinder you might as well in that moment attempt to pause the weight and hold it as long as you can if you're already giving it your all just to get to the last few inches. And as far as doing drop sets, you can either do drop sets, or you can just do partials with the same weight to go beyond your failure point. either method would technically work.
Do leg day with tom platz🤣
Not sure if head butting the weight is the correct form Ed 🤣🤣🤣
Eddie mate you dont need to bulk anymore. You have plenty of body fat. You can already start slowly cutting calories by 500 and see what happens. If you gonna still bulk you gonna just put extra few pounds of body fat for no reason and extend your cutting. Cannot wait to see you below 10% body fat. You gonna be a fucking monster!
Not sure about the headbutting tequnique
What are you going to do about Gyno? Probably never an issue when strongman.
Music at 5:00?
I wonder if they told him about the secret sauce he needs to compete in bodybuilding
used to love a good back session, the pain and stiffness always feels so good after. though haven't trained for years, gym memberships are through the roof these days. plus kids, family, work. need a few more hours on the day lol. cant wait for the next video
the steam coming off of eddie tho
Waiting for Greg to be like Edddie Haaall bulk to 400
Jamie giving me Martin Ford vibes
I’d love to see a collab between Eddie and Ross Dickerson
Eddie has bigorexia wanting to bulk to 400
It's hard to imagine Eddie getting the "v"
If Eddie keeps bodybuilding it’ll definitely be really interesting to see how his body composition changes respectively
Hey coach greg
Really looking forward to seeing your development here - please take it to the limit
Please don’t ‘bulk’ Eddie. You’ll be cutting and miserable for 18 months
so cool
What’s the diet like now?
So good to see you back in a training mood, can’t wait to see where you take it … beast it! - would also like to see the next day and how you recover
11:10 - literally looks like Eddie is smoking from exhaustion
Betty swollocks  21.15
Where is cardio? :D
What a genuinely nice guy Jamie seems. Hope you get more videos with him.
ahh really miss that place/gym -- would love to become a private member jamie - please .   but anyway really enjoyed seeing you and max picking up some great tips and advise from the giant there -- be really interesting to see where your at in about 3 or 4 months time -- keep it going eddie
Are you supposed to be arrested?
Deffo would not be trying to put anymore weight on how many bodybuilders around 20st are dropping dead
Eddie! You need to link up Dr.Mike and his team from RP renaissance
Eddie should visit Jamie when milos is training him. Would be funny
young one is going to be the beast
gotta see a workout with cbum at some point
Loving the content lately, what a gent Jamie is as well, should try and get a session in with kuba at ultra flex 💪
Bro, Eddie was steaming
You can literally see the steam coming off Eddie’s body
we can see results already, keep it up kings
For me a strong man is strong in every situation so I noticed that you are only good in powerlifting exercises so work more in being strong man in everything
Ehall
Loudest and steamiest person in the gym, did you saw how much you were steaming throughout the workout?
max is goning to be a problem in the future , either in the boddy building arena or power lifting  ,good genetics
Great Job taking Max with you im excited to see what beast He will become. Im no kind of expert of any kind just a small Gymrat but i kinda feel unwell seeing him taking the amount of weight and the way he is moving it. Would be sad if He hurts himself with the Training instead of strengthening his body.
Love seeing your boy take an interest in lifting! you can really see he wants to do it and that there no pressure there
Your not the world's strongest man lol
I interested to see Eddie cutting diet
Jamie is one of the really *GOOD* people in bodybuilding....his wife, Katie is great too !!!
Eddi is literally steaming 16:19
In bodybuilding the weight is a tool not the destination....Goodluck Eddie looking forward to see your progress
He already has the best calves   in the game!
Jamie The Giant Christian? So.. is the next level Jamal The Giant Muslim?
great adivice "headbutt it" , my god
Looks like it very cold in that gym
If Eddie sticks to this he’s gonna have a crazy physique
excited to see how he is gonna get rid of that bloated gut of his
Big
r  even trying to learn from him? cause you describe exactly what he is doing and the you keep doing the exact opposite
Going to be exciting watching Eddie's little man grow into a gym beast!
why no one talking about how crazy Eddies body is steaming 😂
PUT HEATING ON!
U need cbum or ronnie
his head be smoking
Waited for a video!
eddie is steaming in the first 10 seconds of the video 0:10 what a beast
Any idea when you will do your stack video? What PEDs are you using for bodybuilding? I assume they change from WSM just like the training?
These videos are brilliant 👏🏻
all natty bro, trust me
atleast one bodybuilder he doesn't dwarf out lol
A week ago this man thought bodybuilding was a joke. Good to see Eddie getting a real taste
No clue on how to train.. Ego lifting style
i think the difference are, strong man trains certain muscle they need to use, body builder sculpt muscle even ones that nobody use
Respect to Eddie for giving all the credit to bodybuilding community and letting people know its not just some gear and boom u look huge. Its a grind
Why are they literally steaming? lmao
Nice to see the Beast in Ilson x
Great to watch this, learning loads I don't know. Eddie you need to do a video when of what your eating now, new diet etc
All the keyboard nubie lifters in the comments who have never built a large quantity of muscle giving advice is hilarious
Really love seeing the gym content back Eddie after the boxing!!
Loving the certified Frog-Tech pose, lol!
Going to be interesting watching eddies physique transform.
Let’s not forget steroids steroids steroids . I notice they didn’t mention
Max is smashing it reminds of a little tom stoltman he is gona be beast number 2 🤙🏻
Cool to see Eddie always willing to learn and try new things....
Will this be done naturally like all bodybuilders……?
I've got the same beast hoodie 🤘
Good work  Eddie more body workout
It's fuckin wild how 15:55 Eddie is literally steaming from how hot he is compared to how cold it is there
Man I can only imagine how much of that Extra Feel Good Eddie must be getting after all that pump.
Eddie doesn’t need to bulk, it’s time to cut. It will incredible to see him around 10%
Would love to see you get trained by Dorian Yates at some point. Would be amazing insight
These bodybuilders way overthink this stuff. It just has to be higher rep with a focus on movement. It’s not magic.
These bodybuilders way overthink this stuff. It just has to be higher rep with a focus on movement. It’s not magic.
James is a machine
Even at the end of the diet u will be Eddy the belly hall
Why is the gym so cold though, there's even steam coming from their mouths.
so much ego lifting in this video
This is great Eddie and Max. What brilliant training too
Those abs still showing from under a decent layer of bodyfat is what gets me... impressive
Eddie get a Coach and become MrO that would be the greatest thing ever in the fitness world
Gotta train with that Jamie dude on the channel some more.....seemed like a really decent bloke.
He punched his dad in the gut LMAO 🤣
9:24 Eddie wasn't exaggerating when he said it was cold! He's blowing smoke! Wtf LOL.
Bubble gut city
Eddie’s head literally fuming at the start is funny ash 💀
where did the boxing "prodigy " go?
Eddie just being a absolute steamtrain here is amazing 😂
Sick collab bro !!
Did anyone else notice eddie having literal steam rise off his head 😂
Loving this journey Eddie, be glad to see what the final transformation will be, well done to big Max too, fantastic effort!
Keep it up Beast!!!
Amazing video
Your son is a unit
Good to see big Jamie taking Eddie under  his lat
Loving this content just now, best I've seen from Eddie
Hate to see Eddie go that heavy, lot of intramuscular fat to lose, cushion his body put on as help with the massive weights. You have the resourced for the right nutritionist and blood tests for glycogen levels to be where need to be. Weight cuts are hard on the body, don't damage the heart or immune system,  you fans and family need you around.
5:32 Eddie’s kid is lifting more than some full grown dudes at the gym 😂 let’s talk q out parenting goals
There's no getting rid of that roid gut though i don't think ever.
Eddie check out Ryan Humistons channel as well. He goes in depth on  correct technique and hand position for each lift 👍💪
Headbutt it! Headbutt it! 🤣🤣
the gym is heated by the heat that comes off the people that train
First time anyone used the word narrow talking about you I imagine.
Too much clothing
Eddie - this was real bodybuilding and what a great session ! Thanks for the regular videos so we can watch your journey! This is how you train ! 😎👍
You need also to change the compounds (roids).
my guy is steaming holy hell man
Love to see that they actively include Max and guide him. Jamie doesnt have to but genuinely cares for him
Great to see Eddie's foray into bodybuilding and training at a proper hardcore gym. Jamie's channel @akathegiant is well worth a follow. A very knowledgeable and likeable bloke. 👍
YOU sir do not have to do more bulking lol! Should get on a diet asap on you will be ready for a show in 2 years time.
Delts need to come up a bit t accentuate the "V" shape
Show him how bodybuilding is. Eddie should fly over to California and see Mike ohearn
Really excited for body building Eddie 🔥
Really good video, you and Jamie should do more videos together
Entire comment section filled with the parrots goons. 🤡 💀
Back aching next day Eddie ?
great job
Eddie your going to be a massive body builder if you stick to this for 1 or 2 years :)
Love this video
instead of beauty and the beast its giant and the beast
First time I think I saw Jamie was 2013 at the Body Power Expo at the NEC and I thought he was big back then. He's a good man, all the best to you both in and out the gym. 🦾
Eddie brother, I love these videos you make, I think you’re doing a great job with everything but please look into and possibly reconsider your 400lb bulk, I understand your mindset coming from a strength and size background, I just think you could do with looking into that a bit bro because that’s not the optimal way you should go about it for bodybuilding….you’re a beast already, maintaining or very small deficit would work wonders for you! Especially if you’re supplementing and training like this  Can’t wait to watch the next one 🦾
Eddie why isn’t pinhead training you?
I really wanna see him train with Hani for a day!!!
Built for warmth and comfort arent ya eddie 🤙🏻
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Eddie turned into a steam engine 🚂
You don´t have to bulk up! Wtf Eddie...
11:09 that’s steam coming of off him, daumn
Anyone see eddies head literally steaming at 21:05 lol. Must be severely dehydrated
Wonder what wee max will look like next year
I am very excited with your foray into Bodybuilding.  Will be following you along the way.  Wish you all the best.
Eddie actually fits well with the bubble gut epidemic.
So happy for ye with this new venture man!! Great session lads.
9:25 it was actually FREEZING cold in there!! 😳😳😳
There literally steaming
That guy was fuming in the intro
I thought you were joking about the cold, and then I see your breath after your take a drink of your juice. Like wow... lol
Seeing your own breath in the gym would be a huge fuck no from me lol
Think you will do great as a body builder but i would cut rather than bulk. You have the muscle already
I can see Max being an even bigger beast than the Beast 😁👍
Good job Eddie. Can see the difference after 2 weeks. Now you know what a bodybuilding workout consists of there will be no holding you back. Frank Zane said he noticed abs were the first thing the eye is drawn to and the difference a lack of them makes. Focus on shrinking that waist measurement to create the X frame illusion. Eliminate bloating. Eat red meat without carbs and you'll lose the gut.
Train with @wycked training!!!
stop calling yourself worlds strongest man ffs
11:10 Eddie is LITERALLY steaming.. What a BEAST 🔥
I'm pumped just watching 😂💪💯
Got to agree with all the keyboard c-bums, you don't need to bulk, you've already done that.
Can definitely see you're making progress with your form.   You already are strong af. What you really nerd to do is slow your reps down to engage the muscle and build it more. And when you're already lifting the whole stack, this helps even more..
Done Power lifting Olympic lifting and body building. Body builders are Budgies. They can't do anything without looking in the mirror. If you can't do a curl after five years of training without looking in a mirror, you have  serious learning difficulties and probably need velcro shoe straps and a regular home visits.
Really obvious question, but how would Christian do in WSM?  The reason Eddie is awesome is because he never gives up!
you can see the thumb placement is different from jamie's to eddie in the latpulldown exercice
Clean diet and plenty of cardio big man. Lets see the E-bum taper.
Ah the cramp that was funny.👍.
Heart attack on imminent
21:00 bro is steaming
When Eddie's body fat drops he's going to look unbelievable...... he still has a little ways to go but he's got the muscle already, just needs Coach Greg's cook book😁 and a good amount of cardio. Good advice for us all. God Bless✝️
You need a pullover machine like Dorian had.
are we just going to pretend like he isnt too fat to bulk? yes yes hes strong, but hes also insanely fat to be bulking
Can we just appreciate how motivating Eddie and Jamie are to Max, he’s definitely gonna go far with the level of support he’s got
Would it be possible for Eddie hall to attempt the 550kg deadlift?
Enjoyed the video.  However you are still not training properly to engage the muscle purely for hypertrophy.  Do not bulk under any circumstances you are delusional if you think you’ll show up on stage at 320lbs in shape.  Bodybuilding is a whole different ballgame and it ain’t just about smashing a load of steroids.
Is he trolling Eddie at 22:22 that's a Genova signature move 💀
Ojh the "dutch giant"  its  been a year or 2 since I heard about him.  Big guy for sure
He should not bulk but lose a lot of weight properly over 100 lbs
Don’t know why he is doing bodybuilding. I understand it’s Eddie hall, and he has the heruculean gene. But that just means he’s way more equipped to do strongman/powerlifting. Bodybuilding is a lot more about being aesthetic, and Eddie is just the opposite of that 😂. He’s built for strength and performance, not to look pretty.
Jamie is a Real gentleman.
id like to see lower weight and better control, body building is about keeping tension on the muscle not just throwing the weight around which is why phil heath was so good
Thanks for the content
Lol the shot at Cbum was funny but idont think you could get small enough to compete in classic.
He actually need cut 100 pounds of fat at first.
Great to see you bonding with your son! I used to do the same with my dad and brings back memories
I think Eddie should really get a good coach, and do whatever he says. It would be such a big help for him, both for training and nutrition.
I get the feeling there's a slight temperature difference between this gym and the Metroflex gym in Arlington Texas.
I wanna see eddie when he diets. Hope he does it sooner rather than later.
Hes Steaming like an cooking pot
EBum is coming !
The fact you can see Eddie's abs while he's still so fat is very impressive. He should definitely not be bulking because he's already bulked lol.  He's already got the muscle, just keep what he's got and cut the fat and he'll look amazing.
Tbf Eddy doesn't have bodybuilder potential. His body is not made for it. But very curious to see how it will look
Eddie man please get a session with the master Dorian Yates. And you'll be toast in half an hour.
Yes beast!! Cnt wait to see the results in a full year of this!!!
This series is so good,  Legit excited to see Eddie's transformation
Is eddy on the sauce? How strictly is strongman regulated? I never got the feeling steroids where used in strongman, but they are mandatory in body building. Don't think eddy will cross that bridge
Eddie you don't need to bulk to 400lb just cut from where your at
I want to see eddie as a bodybuilder..... I want to see how far he can go with this body weight..... He is a fighter I believe he'll do his best
Eddie doing everything completely different to Jamie even had the close grip on the low row upside down the whole time...
That kid is gonna be bigger than both of them. Look at the size of him.
19:06 Jamie is literally smoking 😂😂
Max looking stronger than last time
This is an amazing series already! Following Eddie on this journey will be a real treat and a great way to learn from the pros.
Its rare to see a tall man that has such a physique like him
Awesome! :)
Carbs around ur training Eddie if you want ur waist to be smaller , not intra workout , massive difference in a short period of time.
I said that Greg Doucette was going to get involved and I was right... have y'all watched the videos that he's done? LOTS of great information in these videos to help us grow and to be safe while we're doing it.  I'm loving these videos and bringing Max into it, brilliant!!!
Hand position was opposite on the low rows .
Do they not have heating in the UK?
Mind muscle contraction.
😭😭🔥 lats
Legend 😭🔥🔥🔥🔥😀
Eddie needs to do a training session with Dorian Yates. Make it happen Hall!
Hello Eddie  u have bodyform like big boy from strength cartel  years ago I think u get good body what u now still  have. Some little % fat burning then u are perfect😇🤔⭐💪🗽🌐
Jamie has great form 👍
Bodybuilding and powerlifting are two different things.
Always remember the form. Lowering the weight just a tad bit to be able to control the weight is key in bodybuilding. Keeps the tension on the muscles. If you want to have some cheat reps in the end you can do that. But not a whole set
Eddie would be a machine if he cut up
You know it's a beast workout when Eddie Hall looks at the camera like 17:18
hi
everybody is crying he should cut first lol he isnt even that fat
0:00 Literally steaming hot
I prefer full range of motion with full control of weight but there is not one rule
I would love to see you train with the RP strength crew
I'm going to learn a lot myself from Eddie's body building adventure 😎
you can see the steam coming off of mr hallway
Eddie has special effects for his back 😬 It can smoky🥵
its not all about tension some of the best growth comes from when your muscles have to stretch under load so really you want to stretch at the bottom and then contract all the way and stop just shy of the top and then repeat
how fkin cold is that gym for them to have steam coming off their bodies??
This is a really good series for people doing what is essentially a body recomposition, a regular diet update would be good and also how that differs from strongman.👍
Would like to see Dorian put Eddie through his paces
17:19 that’s not a cluster set
I thought Eddie was just being a bitch about it being cold, but you can literally see their breath 😂 turn on the damn heat my guy
This was my local gym before Jamie took it private. It's very very cold in the winter and very very hot in the summer. A proper old school gym with lots of history.
im not really into strongest man but apprently there are a lot of them is there 1 strongest man who had like minimum of 5 runs ups if yes who?
Eddie I think you should cut and focus on longevity for your son and your wifel Your a great guy
how low is the temperature in that gym ?
all those fake bodybuilders and strength players don't tell the truth, #1 rules should be in every video, before going to gym, inject Test, GH, and other roids then go to gym.
When is that video with Jesse James coming out?
Eddie needs @coachgreg , not yes men 🙄
How does he fit in a church?
Why does he want to be a bodybuilder exactly?? Easily the most unhealthy sport, possible the only exception is his old sport of powerlifting (and maybe darts) At this point he doesn’t need the money, maybe he should focus on getting fit and healthy so his son can see him past the age of 50
Eddie's son put more plates than I normally do most days lol
Eddie just needs to binge watch videos from RP or get a good coach. Taking advice from top athletes is generally a mistake in any sport. While they are amazing at what they do, teaching and competing are two very different skills. Learn from the best teachers not the top students!
You get tired wierdly fast
i cant wait for the Coach Greg episode on this one 🤣
Try full range of motion. There is still too much momentum going on and this is steroid training.
Imagine eddy just absolutely pounding your cheeks, my god daddy. The Beast mmm
Great work guys keep going Eddie  👍👊💪💪
Will Eddie be natty or not on this journey
Strongman to Bodybuilder. That’s like an MMA fighter going to Boxing or a Football player trying Rugby.
The problem for Eddie in bodybuilding is his massive waist... Hard to contrast with other muscles.
So is Eddy going for another world record again?!
I don't think you need to bulk Eddie
"Good job on the farts as well Max" ... like Father like Son 😄😄😄 good work out, can't wait to see the return of the Beast 💪
Think the giant needed to drop the weight on the low row machine 😂
Do they sell shit that reverses palumboism now?
Absolutely brilliant I love this . Just fantastic  the idea of bodybuilding on this channel
Eddie is my man crush 😍
Can’t wait to see Eddie doing smith machine Bulgarian split squats in a bikini outfit
so eddie... when are you due ... that belly sure looks big XD
Bro went cigar mode 💀💀💀
Good to see your taking max on your bodybuilding journey with you. Max is like having a mini Brian shaw with you beating you up all time the time 💪😂
Eddie was steaming the whole video lol
Eddie wasn't joking about the temperature, he was a walking sauna
Get ur self in with trained by JP
The cut is gonne be biblical
I don’t get why people say that the muscle is resting when you don’t stop the motion a bit before the full range of motion when the muscles are clearly under a loaded stretch. Full contraction & full stretch never did me wrong even if i have to lift less weight
E-Bum is here 😂
looks like the bulk is going well
Wait. I thought him starting doing bodybuilding was a meme, i didnt think he was actually serious about it. Thats dissapointing.
Is anyone noticing how boiling hot Eddie is here? My man took the meaning getting warm to a whole new level 11:08
Eddie is a home sauna in that gym 😂😂
Ill i want to know is what are the roids the beast is on. Those are some good, middle east, non regulated stuff
Enjoy urs an max's vids on a Sunday nite,givs me motivation 4 my training on a Mon an week ahead💪👊👍
Your form is absolutely terrible, you aren't focusing on controlling the weight during the movement and keeping tension, rather you are just throwing the weight around, plus you should cut first then bulk.
Hes not gonna become the next Cbum but hes gonna become Ebum. Good luck on your journey💪
I fuckin love those Rich Piana size drink jugs.
Is getting into body building at this age a good idea?
What was temperature in that spot.
🔥🔥🔥🔥Collab
Go watch Mike van Wyck's videos, you WILL learn alot from him!
Awsome
the intro with Eddie literally fuming had me destroying my ribs from laughter
0:08 the steam coming off his body truly demonstrates the effort that this man is putting in bodybuilding
You know Eddie is beyond dedicated when he said his training sessions were four hours... O:
Workout with bodybuilders not this clown
Now this is training
Don't ever lose the power belly!  This is what puts you between the normal body builders and the Gods!!
Eddie is built like the Juggernaut
You think that gym is cold you can try mine, its in a car port in Canada!
Why dont you train with Aaron? He is a bodybuilder too but you only have to train how big your belly can get, much easier 😋😆
It looks like the damn Victorian Blacking factory Oliver Twist worked in, or the Debtors Prison Dickens' Dad was sent to.
What's the temp in the weight room...I see yalls breathe...lol
Eddie bulking back up to 400 pounds is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.  No good bodybuilding coach would advise him to do this. He’d be ruining his insulin sensitivity so hypertrophy wouldn’t occur as much as if he cut now, dropped body fat & then gained muscle afterwards.   On top of that, he would be potentially destroying his health too, which could have implications when he’s getting very lean
you need to build your self up as you will know but good on you for doing it i used to do it in the 60s but too old and painful now but i would loved to thanks for the video
K help me out guys, am I really the only one who doesn't think Eddie needs to body build at all - if he just cut like 75 lbs he'd already be perfect. ?
Eddie is literally smoking 🔥
Good luck with bodybuilding
Good job Eddie 👍
Fam now cold is it in there?  There’s smoke coming out their mouths when they breathe 😂
How is the bulk going? You were already at bulk fat level so how bulk you want to go? If you go too heavy the shred will be nasty.
