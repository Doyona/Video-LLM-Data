*Who Knew Running A Cult would be so Profitable?*
SB finally met his match! A game that forced you to get coffee at a deal you can't refuse 😅
This is a cult. WAIT! I mean, not a cult. Def not a cukt
This is definitely purely a cult

here is my absurd build which broke the game: 2 eldrich (buffed continuously by picking and removing hexes) 8 diamonds  3 card sharks (make diamonds into wild cards) 3 jokers (buff diamonds) 4 gold arrows  I think I spun like ~3k times or so, and the game started crashing on my android
Spiff I really think you should revisit this game, there’s now even crazier ways to break the game
First time I’ve seen spiff play a game regularly, I was expecting him to do one of those synergies that gives you trillions of coins.
We don't run cults nor do we participate in tax evasion
This is a cult 😂
This is nothing. Find the item where all the tiles on the board are considered adjacent every x spins. Get and keep only dames and amethysts. Remove all other items from the pool  I got up to spins of whatever x e13 in value
As a brit, i'd bet you'd call this 'maths'

The easiest way to read exponents is every 3 means another 3 zeros added on 1^e3 is 1,000 (thousand) 1^e6 is 1,000,000 (million) 1^e9 is 1,000,000,000 (billion) 1^e12 is 1,000,000,000,000 (trillion)
This is a cult
I ended up buying this game off Steam after watching this video. I followed Spiff's strategy and can confirm that it does indeed work. However I also found an even better one which brought in MILLIONS per roll. It involves buffing amethyst's using the old lady and arrows. I ended up getting rid of my 12 +100 Eldritch Horrors because they were just slowing me down!

So what you're telling me is that in order to afford rent, I should start a cult?
This is not a cult.
This is absolutely a cult. It is in fact just like Scientology; you gather idiots/cultists purely to make money off of them, and the more you gather the more you make - and then occasionally you “whoops misplace” a Shelly somewhere.  Incidentally: Where’s Shelly, David? Where is she?
The topics is saying it is a cult but it is NOT a cult
THIS IS NOT A CULT
Spiff: 1.8e4 is like 40 grand Math: 1.8e4 is 1.8×10⁴ which is 18 grand
This is definitely not a cult
It actually started with a cult, how ironic.
Not bad I guess. I spent fewer payments playing than you did and was getting more than your total in a single roll though.

What is this game
Clicking the Like button for the interns.
This is not a cult
This game is easy af. Just farm amethyst using geologist (early on, and a dame if you can. This is because geologist will carry you early) and eventually just cycle out to dames and amethyst. My current run is like 4 dames 2 golden arrows 1 wild card (because it can be up to 8x the amount of a 16x amethyst if it plays right with spy glass and arrows lining up.) and 13 amethyst. At 10mil but i kinda quit for now cuz its lowkey just press spin over and over have amethyst increase in value perpetuate the cycle etc. The only problem is dames only give you 2 even with all the buffs, but they are so necessary because of the 2x they give to amethyst.  I tried cultist build but lowkey its trash. Its literally worse than a diamonds, and damn diamonds are bad late game. My most valuable amethyst without any bonuses or multipliers gives me the same amount as the highest diamond value i have seen having like 8 1.5x diamonds with dames and golden arrows
This is not a cult

The maker of the game banned me from his steam forum because I hurt his feelings with some criticism. Not trolling posts but no matter. That's when I stopped playing and didn't care anymore.

If time is counted by spins, just don’t use the slot machine, and never pay rent!

I know im a year late but damn would i love to see thjs drawn out until the game actually breaks and crashes or something
I love minmaxing
Comment !!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Try with the geologist. He will eat the ore and the vast majority of what comes out. Golem and mines make him soooooooo much more broken the your eldritch. Ya it doesn't share the buff but you can feed it with oysters forever.

For anyone who doesn’t know, XeY, where X and Y and numbers means X*10^Y.   1.1e4 means 1.1*10^4, which is 11,000.
Spiff HATE coffee!?  UNSUBSCRIBE!!! 😡
I knew you couldn't resist the overwhelming power Of Coffee
This grouping should under no circumstances be considered a cult, and any likewise accusations will be taken deeply and dealt with immediately. - Definitely not a cult member or paid off spokes man
To be clear, this is not a cult.
when irl tutorial
Your interns need a raise Spiff, they're drinking so little Tea they feel correcting the Tea God is acceptable!  Nah great work all round, your content is awesome and so is the team. Thanks for the hard work everyone, you bring smiles to people's faces for sure!
I mean, it's an incremental game. There is always that point in which you reach critical mass and nobody can stop you.
if spiff ever goes to a gambling room... the statement "the house always wins" will not be valid anymore 🤣🤣🤣
this is not a cult
"we love tax evasion" sounding very American there spiff
Tbh after watching Aliensrock play this, spiff’s amounts here look puny
Let's go gambling!

I love how to pay off your rent you have to actively get involved with cults and eldritch horrors.
DO NOT LET THIS MAN NEAR A CASINO
Hello from America I like tea soaked in sugar and coffee in the morning. And any tea is Lipton not Yorkshire.
Nah if you have the guillotine relic and you get to a billion coins you die because the guillitine destroys billionare tokens and once you become a billionare you become the guillitines target :)
I love this game
This is not a cult just tax envision
22:27 1.8e4 which is like 40 grand 😭
This is a pretty weak endless mode build compaired to cats.
This is not a cult
I have been coerced into saying that this is not a cult by a suspected cult leader. Nothing suspicious with that sentence. Carry on.

This game should be expanded with the option to buy houses and become a landlord. (One day you'd collect more rent than expend on rent, called a sure win.)
15:50 You do know ur a bit nuts right ? (It's ok, it's not mandatory to live on Earth, but it helps.)
Don't let him find out about the flowers

when bro is looking for images he says "firxk this one doesnt have the gird above it"
I drink black tea :(
The coffee is not for drinking it's used as a projectile to throw at the landlord so you can scare them away for another quick spin. Since you don't want to throw you hot tea instead Right?
2:35  pet cat?
Amethysts are the way to go i think.
Boring game
wait, You are paying rent 50x in one day? How much that landlord needs?
Wdym this is not a cult? THIS IS A CULT!!!!!!
this is not a cult
Challenge you to attempt this again, a bunch of symbols have been added since this video
12:30 why are you mad if you are destroying coffee not drinking it
this is definitely a cult
"This is not a cult😊"
THIS IS A CULT
Fun fact: by spinning the slot machine you’re cause major inflation
Believe it or not there is a better build that makes billions per spin involving suns and flowers, but involves a relic which makes the corners adjacent to everything so it is a little less consistent than the cults.
This is very much a cult
Stonks
THIS IS NOT A CULT I REPEAT ONT A CULT.
12:51 This could also be interpreted as: You’re not drinking the coffee… You’re destroying the coffee in front of the coffee loving collector, scaring him and forcing him to give you yet another spin
This guy literaly british lets gam it out
This is not a cult
There's a reason that this doesn't work in real life... Not because the exorbitant amounts you earn, but because if it was number of spins, you could just refuse to spin... Even *if* you got a lot of money they could change the value of a "gold coin" and hence it's a funny concept, but wouldn't work irl... That's why we have videogames children!
THIS IS NOT A CULT
Just a little information to pass along, when games use e, its shorthand scientific notation so 2.2e5 would be 2.2*10 to the 5th power (220000). In case anyone was curious (:
This is not a cult
So what you're saying is that I need to join a cult to pay rent?  Sounds about right 🎉🎉
Bro skipped protractor with switch light...

This is not a cult........It's a Commune -E-TEA
I spammed through the intro and it just sounded like a compilation of spiff going hello ladies and gentlemen
this is not a cult
you can respin for rare items with lucky capsule and sleeping pillow btw the most broken run is with 19 suns and a single flower. there is an essence in the game wich says when sun and moon are adjacent to each other, they are adjacent to everything permanently. therefore the sun boosts the flower by times 5. so we got 1*5*5*5*5*5*5*5*5*5*5*5*5*5*5*5*5*5*5*5=1.9073486e+13. i tested it already, most broken thing ever
Given rent's due date is calculated by slot machine rolls, the real exploit is to not roll and get free rent forever!! 😂😂😂😂
This is not a cult😂😂
This is a cult!
The build I've found most broken in this game is Miners, Dames, Ores, and Geologists. It works out quite similarly to this combo, but most of the gems themselves have very powerful synergies and can quickly get you absurd amounts of cash. It's also much faster than the not-a-cult strategy, since there are so many ores and gems in the game compared to just one type of cultist.
This is not a cult...
He turned into the 1%
aliensrock had so much money it went behind the spin button
This is not a cult
Wait until he hears about the bees and the flowers

honestly flowers can give u alot more
I just got an add about google translating French into English.  Why would I ever care what is written in French.

It's amazing that Spiff was able to make so much money without even being apart of a cult!
This is not a cult.
This game is so much fun :D At one point i ended up with a run of nothing but 14 wolves and 6 moons, a protractor and Quigley the Wolf. Every third turn it made 4000+ gold.
I hope you play the newer version where you can race to become a billionaire and die!

this is not a cult
By the way the 'e' in the numbers is to denote significant notation, it's a quicker way of writing x*10^(y) which looks confusing as balls but basically the number after 'e' is how many zeroes there are before or after the first number, so for example: 1e4 = 10,000 2.4e3 = 2,400 8.8e-6 = 0.0000088

all i've gathered from this game is that you need to join a cult and summon a lovecraftian diety to pay off rent in london
this isnt a cult
You could easily make this your career, finding bugs in websites and games for developers.
This is most definitely a cult :-p
This is a cult
It's crazy how the spiffing Brit is now synonymous with exploits I've seen clips on shorts of people just putting his thumbnails in when the word exploit is mentioned
Message understood. When you're short on rent money, start a cult.
this is not a cult
I feel like the end of the video described spiffs youtube career in a nutshell. It started as a nice Hobbie for fun. Now Spiff is sitting around drinking tea every night shouting Money Money Money.
No exploits, mediocre-bad strategy... use next time flower build or if you want the perfect build, try the cat one, until you make billions
yeah drink that coffee spiff, WOOT WOOT!
This is not a cult
The coffee should be replaced with seas of tea
No matter how much money you make this is still your second try because the first one broke you like cheap china. LOL
This is a cul......not a cult
This is not a cult.
The real definition of suffering from success
The maximum I managed to get in one roll: - 1 Flower (gives 1 gold) - 19 Suns (gives 3 gold + adjacent flowers give x5 more) - Clear sky item (suns affect non-adjacent tiles) For a total of a bit more than 5^19 gold (~1.9e13 gold)
On the coffee hating it did say you destroy it and absorb its Flippin soul for your own benefit and generate enough money to give a free rent payment and by absorbing its inanimate soul it would I assume make it in an endless purgatory
my favorite is my amethyst build, im sitting on like 2,576,628 gold, and my amethysts are like +90 +173 and +212, its crazy good

For those of you who don’t understand the #.#…e#, I’ve got you covered. It’s the scientific notation. The # after the “e” is 10 to the power of the number. Then, you multiply that number by the first number(1-9, however many digits). Hope this helps understanding how much your spending and how to brag to your friends.
This is not a cult
It's kind of funny that this isn't even the most broken build... Only game I've seen that Spiff didn't realize how to really break.
you know you're doing well in a game when it switches to scientific notation
How to spot a newbie - picked clover over protractor (8:29)
Wouldn’t it be too much to pay rent if it keeps increasing at some point there’s a max amount of money you can win and won’t it be above that in endless mode at one point

Brit truly is a gambler with the way he goes "Money money money money money!"
To be fair, at least this game isn't in the UK. Here you just have to pay twice your rent every payment instead of getting kicked out for no reason by the government.
This is not a cult
This guy is literally Sketch but british version💀💀
Hearing Spiff say "his majesty's" makes me sad.
THIS IS--Aha! I've suddenly appeared in the middle of the comment, because I could!--NOT A CULT.
This not a cult, but drink tea.... I'm drinking some Yorkshire tea right now..... not gold, I'm not upper class like spiff.... but regular Yorkie tea is plenty good
THIS IS NOT A CULT
For anyone confused about the e4, e5, etc. It is scientific notation. Basically just means that many more digits on. 1e4 is is 1+ 4 0 digits added on to the back, so it would be 10000 which is 10 grand. The 1.8e4 he paid around the end was 18 grand. In comparison, he had over 52 million, so needless to say, the game was thoroughly broken
This is not a cult
Is it just me or did anyone else read the title as "India game"

Spiff, did you let Liz Truss be your landlord?
Spiff, if you want to do integer limit scaling, play a bit more to unlock Essences, then do a Cat Build. Cats have an essence that multiplies their value by 13x, which can be gotten multiple times, to allow you to get absolutely insane scaling.  You can also do flowers + Sun + Clear Skies for absurd numbers.  I will also say that its kinda disappointing to see notation. I miss the old days when it literally displayed the number. I decided I wanted to see the number go clean across the entire screen once. It was hilarious to see.
Anyone else wondering whether the Spiffing gentleman will play/make a video on Hogwarts Legacy?
(In case Spiff didn't know, the "e" is for scientific notation haha. So 1e4 means 1x10^4 or 10,000)
This is not a cult

No spiff who knew running totally not a cult 🤔🙄😳😝

Mmm cult money
I have never played this game and probably never will, but there is something so enjoyable about a perfectly optimized “deck”
I was watching this while drinking turkish tea I feel very good for timing
This is not a cult.
There's something about the phrase, "It's just escaped Early Access..." that is so incredibly correct... I don't know how else to describe it. But any game that is released after Early Access does feel like it somehow, against the odds, escaped.
Hey Spiff, could you please politly ask the King to send the Redcoats to whoever is ordering Youtube to target me on your videos with horific and disgusting coffee ads? Thank you so much! <3
Hi guys! If you are a gaming lover, especially the metaverse game trend, don't miss the THE MERA project! It's well worth looking into
Kind of reminds me of backpack hero
the real winner in this game is the landlord since the only thing you can spend your money on is to pay the rent.

Yes, the game is balanced like that indeed, howeverthere are other strategies which can give you millions per spin. There is I think a cat strategy whichis insane due to some relics
My favorite part is that there isn't even an exploit in this video, this is just the game.
bruh… you skipped protractor for clover?!?!
This Is Not A Cult
This game always starts out with: just one quick game. And ends with: 1 million coins every spin while the rent is barely 100 K so you just quit out because the game drives you insane
I love luck be a landlord. I think I need to purchase this game.
If only this way of making money was as reliable in real life as it is in this cu- I mean family friendly and perfectly balanced community!     Help me, I’ve been captured by the perfectly balanced cul…
The game was built for 30+ long numbers
These are rookie numbers cats, flowers, sun and rain is just broken. As well as tons of other builds
XeY is X with Y zeros next to it, so 1.4e4 would be 14,000
spiff, the coffee is in the game but the game lets you destroy the coffee! it's perfect! we want to destroy the coffee spiff, destroy all the coffee
Wait until he find out about flower water and bees
This game is actually dangerous. It suggests the opinion of being actually able to win with a slot machine.
This might be a cult.
THIS IS NOT A CULT.
I love how there technically wasn't any unintended exploits or glitches. This is just the game working as intended. XD Very Youtube indeed!!
SpiffTopia should exist in bannerlord 2 😈
Man I remember my first break in this game. Was just wolf and moons. I had trillions lmao
Hey spiff, are you gona exploit the new DeadSpaceRemake ?
Spiffing brit develops gambiling addiction 101
Watched the whole thing. No idea what’s going on
make a video of spiffing creed
Wait till spiff discovers telescope+flower+19suns+essences
The spiff today was all bout MONEY  MONEY  MONEY!!!!!!!
This is not a cult!
If The Spiffing Brit made a game, their would either be a game proving the USA is trash compared to all mighty Tea drinkers or a tea vs coffee battle royal sim(Don’t ask how that is possible he is the Spiffing Brit)
I feel like I watched either RT or Kevin play this before and pull off the same cultist strategy purely as a meme. Maybe not to this extreme, but it was certainly ridiculous lmao
ThIs is no5 a cu)t
this is not a cult
look into the monkey you'll like what you find
What the hell happened to the font?
Can you make a skyrim video with star wars mods
so THIS is what winning this game is like. I've never seen anyone beat the main "story" of the game let alone make 5k off of one slot
Can you exploit DarkOrbit? It's a MMORPG spaceships based full of bugs
This is not a cult!?
Wondering why Spiff just started removing hexes instead of letting his horrors eat them so they would get even stronger
This is not a cult
Well sniffing brit, you have won. I no longer dink coffee. And instead now drink tea. You win
Thi$ i$ NOT a Cult!
This is not a cult.
Who&#39;s still watching in 2023?
Teaaaaa
"McLandlord"? In my experience it'd be more like Landy Landlordstein.
this is a cult
This Is In no way a cult Suzan we promise
I haven't had spiffing brit pop up in my feed for months thanks you  tube I'm  3 months  behid !!!
I feel like this guy is a bit of a youtube sometimes
I'm not sure if you know about this already, but if you keep going back and hitting a gender in mount and blade with fire and sword when creating a character, it gives you more stats and skill points. So you can keep going back to picking male/female and gain inf stats.
Gotta ask how that tea pc been going
No Sir this is NOT a cult
How did he pronounce fast at the start?? 🤨🤨
"Biiiiig Moneyyyyy"
12:45 don't worry, don't worry, you *destroy* the coffee.
This is a cult
My choice of exploit is using a geologist (to build up like eldritch horrors), suit cards, card sharks (that treat suits as wildcards), and jokers (along with other items that double/quadruple the suits that are now wildcards). It's perfectly balanced :D
This is not a cult:)
can you break cookie clicker?
This is not a cult
To prevent it going on literally endlessly, you can find an item called a guillotine, which will kill you the moment you get 1 billion gold.  :D
When are you going to show off your new computer?
Ok, how do you allways find those youtube exploids??
Do note a "guaranteed rarity" symbol pick persists with rerolls, so if you are bound to get a rare that pick there will also be a rare in any of the rerolls.
As a canadian i would rlly like to join the cult
This is not a cult
Beware of the sun and flower build because that can literally put you in endless mode. And wish I had recorded my game play of that build
1.1E
Thanks to you Mister spiffing Brit, I've consumed well over 347,356 cups of yorkshire tea.
This video is so YouTube
This is not a cult ,this is better then a cult ,it's a YouTube community
This Is A Cult!!🥰
... so this is just a normal floor 1 endless run. You said there were exploits.... These are just game mechanics.
this is not a cult
The way Spiff can take literally any game and obliterate any balance... Such a YouTube.
Love it :D
Oh snap! You broke it! 😂
This is not a cult
This is a cult, but don't worry, it's tea not kool-aid
THIS IS A CULT
I wish I could exploit the reality.
So if you pin an English policeman’s comment will it become a Bobby pin 😂
THIS IS NOT A CULT!
I don't know about you but this is pure YouTube. I have nothing else to say besides YouTube everything about this.
the thing I'm wondering about is who is filling the slot machine with millions of dollars
this is not a cult
this is not a cult. -did i do it right, boss?
this is not a cult :p
pov: you get a complimentary slot machine that can run a cult, summon eldritch beings, and make infinite money
I really hope that your coffee dislike is something personal, instead of being some sort of bs British patriotism or whatever.  Good video, though. As always.
I love this NOT cult
i didnt even know you could win that game in endless mode
Spif, this video is way too YouTube for the target audience
Just got into your videos not too long ago and I love them, I do have a question though. Is there a reason you havent done an exploit video on fallout 3? Is there not enough things to exploit in that game compared to other Bethesda titles, or do you not really enjoy playing that one? Literally just curious, not complaining! Thanks for all the entertainment
This is not a cult
The “e” denotes scientific notation. 1.8e4 is 1.8x10^4 so 1.8e4 is 18,000, not almost 40k 😂😂
This is not a cult
The real winner of this Game is the landlord
I am certain this isn't a cult. I'm trying to get my friends and family to agree too!
This is NOT a cult.
Spiff does NOT have a cult. Kevin on the other hand...
bro is getting a little too into gambling i’m getting concerned
WTF is that game? Don t know if I love it or hate it
Spiff, I dare you to find an exploit in dwarf fortress.
Queens dead lol
This is not a cult
This is not a cult.
TLUC A SI SIHT
This game is super addicting and very fun. Try some other strategies and see if you have the same success! It's so good!
This is not a cult
Yeah branding this as an exploid video didnt resonate too well 😂
There are many more exploids in this game.... Ask Tyler from aliensrock 😂
This is the most British person playing the most British game I've ever seen and I live in Britain
The best exploit is just don't spin, and since the rent is due in spins, just don't spin and you don't have to pay, and you now get the apartment for free
Damn, you dint completely break the game, not even close someone buffed a cat so much that it could make 75 quintillion in one spin
Please do Chrono Ark game. I want to know how to exploit the game
Redbush tea is best
If only my pc was Cooled by Yorkshire tea gold 😉😂 nice pc spiff!
Did anyone else watch DF(dangerously funny) play this like 3 years ago?
I mean what better way to get out of a dystopian empire than starting a cult, I see only good coming of this
I am here to say this is not a cult, but it's a damn good time. Eldrich horrors are apparently very profitable! I wonder what Nartholep's bank account is like. Hmm...
Did Spiff actually make this video? Or was it an AI?
Theres an item that kills u if u have more than 1,000,000 gold
you go until suddenly all your money is gone and you're severely in dept. overflow error.
More moneyyy
KILL THE RABBIT.  Honestly though, your spins could have gotten much more beastmaster and horrors if you didn't have 4-5 rabbit fluff every spin.
This is a cult    Wait
This is not a cult
16:08 THATS 1E
only legends watch the spiffing brit while holding a cup of Yorkshire Tea Gold
Not a cult

This is *not* a cult
This is not a cult ;)
This is not a cult
Spiff please...  Amethyst or Pear.   And once you unlock essences? Cats.  Have fun
15:30 Well you need cultists to have a cult but you only have a couple of Eldrich creatures.
Have you played Thrive? It’s free to play, and they’ve got the cell stage rn and it’s even better then spores with more on the way.
Have you played Thrive? It’s free to play and but super good
Ending a run with guillotining yourself is the best way to prove This is not a cult
Glad he didn't do sun flower build, but if you put a cultist between two horrors both eat the one cultist buffing them by two not 1
I like this cult
This is not a cult.
This is Not a cult!
im glad after all these years he's still making great content!!!
*prepares to be smited* i like coffee better than tea
This is a cult. The cult of infinite money
Hey Spiffing Brit ive been watching your videos for awhile now and theres a game I DEMAND YOU BREAK... jkjk but please break its automation system. AUTONAUTS this game is minecraft meets stardewvally. you craft tools and harvest ingredients for building stuff. the twist you code robots to do automated work. please break the coding i know you can
This is not a cult.
I approve of the use of sci notation
NEXT: ChatGPT plays Detroit:become human
i honestly want to know how much tea was sold because of him
Can u do an exploit in Albion Online? I want the market to crash for a few days bc it’ll b funni
wdym its not a cult or anything 🤔🤔
3:53 is where I noticed exactly what build he was doing  It’s not really an exploit as much as it is a really powerful build.  An even more broken build for when you unlock essences is: 13 cats, 6 hexes of the same type, 1 witch  This enables you to grab many essences that multiply the value of the symbols, and one essence makes the cats initial value copy that of the highest adjacent symbol’s value
This is a cult
This is cult a not
So where was the exploit? That's how the game works.  Also the card build is better.
This is not a cult
As a former cult member, I can firmly attest to the fact that this is not a cult.
did you get your LMG PC?
THIS IS NOTA CULT
This is not a cult, and I am not a cultist.
nice, lol. I half expected to see the coffee post edited to tea, haha!
I love that he has no idea what the e means
Haha funny tea man
this is not a cult
this is not a cult
No sympathy for the landleeches!
Just keep spinning, just keep spinning
This is not a cult
The fact that this is recent and i missed it i should be ashamed.
The Waffle House has found it’s new host
it just works
I got my tea and I'm ready to watch this amazing video
Sorry Spiff, I normally like your videos but you did Luck Be A Landlord dirty. Or I guess not dirty enough. The game expects you to be able to generate billions not thousands. Either flower/sun strat or cats is how to break the game, not cultists.
Where are the essences :<
Video got me to play the game... this strategy works just too well.
This is most certainly a cult. 🙉
This is a cult please help us!
Nay, tis not a cult, tis the yorkshire tea family
This is certainly not a cult at all in any way. Why would you think that?
Us players of this game know the real exploits are the Essence items
This most certainly is NOT a cult. We are a collectivist commune of eldrich enthusiasts.
Just wait until Spiff finds out about flowers and suns😅
Idea: The coffee is used to scare of the landlord. It is a necessary evil.
But at what cost? I mean you really had to feed the cultists to the Lovecraftian Horror!
Great content for the notacult
If you think this is powerful the pears chefs and farmers are even better and when you get essences the game is so easy to break.
This is not a cult
this is totally not a cult about feeding people to an eldrich monster
This is totally 100% not a cult and you can't prove otherwise.
We aren't a cult we are a group of happy unpaid interns. I'm always happy now that Spiff has put a chip in my brain to make me a more efficient worker praise Spiff
They're after me and I wanted to warn the authorities that this is in fact a cu- *spiffing gunshot*
not a cult not a cult not a cult notacultnotacult NOT A CULT
Oh, if only he knew about the flower strat… 😈
this is not a cult
There's an item that kills you, the player, if you reach one billion gold. You should try for that sometime!
Definitely a cult
First comm, what a surprise it was to see the rules to use the comment section 😂  Okay i'm french, i usually drink Coffee (pls dont ban me) but instead I really feel like a lovely proud british when i watch your videos and hope you got sponsored by Yorkshire Tea cuz im about to buy some and finally have my "nice, warm cup of tea" to appreciate your content at the purest state i can be.   (Hope it means smthg)   Much love, even more respect ✌🏽
THIS IS NOT A CULT
I subscribed as soon as you said lazy bastard lol
This is not a cult
This is not a cult
THIS IS NOT A CULT!
*Ahem Hot leaf juice That is all
Why is this game so real……
This is not a cult, no worries.
When Lovecraftian Horror is your rich grandma and not your executioner... Nice !!
There's an option there to turn off scientific notation, that should probably get rid of the 1.1e4 etc numbers, hopefully replacing them with lovely, lovely digits, so you can see your money right there on the screen, instead of only in your brain after working it out. e is "exponent" btw. So 1.1e4 means move 4 places left, or add 4 zeroes. Except for the decimal point in 1.1 means you only add 3 zeroes, since the .1 is only a tenth of a unit, so 1.1e4 is 11000 coins.
This is not a CULT!
This is not a cult
I just had my first cup of yorkshire gold tea this week. It was immaculate.

This is not a cult.
I went to Britain this week. My first task was to buy yorkshire tea also gold verison.... Now I'm enjoying tea like a sir!
This is not a cult!
"1.1e4 ... what it's like 10500?" yup 11 plus 4 zeros. You were close enough i'd say.
This is not a cult! Did I do it right Grand High Cult Leader Spiff?
This is not a cult
Best I've seen on Youtube is over a trillion coins on one spin. My personal best is some millions.
this is not a cult? then why did i have to donate money?
This is the best cult
this is not a cult
This is not a cult.
"You can pet the dog. Game of the year. '10/10,' IGN." lol
This is not a cult.
I'm positively sure that this is NOT a cult!
I don't know if its still in the game, but cats can generate septillions of gold eventually.  Doubling, wild cards, beast masters, and telescope make it crazy.
This is not a cult.
Based off of the font, isn't this an old build of the game?
This si not a cult
This isn't a cult 😳
THIS IS NOT A CULT
This is not a cult
Cats are more broken imo
?
It seems all those people who sold their souls for riches were on to something.
This is definitely not a cult 😅
THIS IS NOT A CULT.  I have been NOT sacrificed by The Spiffing Brit to Cthulhu to make him millions.
Thumbs up for the interns
this is not a cult
This is *NOT* a cult
Where can I play this game?
This is Not a cult.
So his majesty is aware, this is NOT a cult, this is hustlers university
THIS IS NOT A CULT.
Been loving your videos for awhile glad you made it to this game. Hopefully you’ll come back to it once you get to level 25
This is not a cult
I don't mean to ruin ur fun but the game is meant to be broken like this and the infinite mode has an ending but u need 1 billion at least and an item called guillotine and then u win the infinite mode
This is not a cult
This is not a cult
I do love a good spiffing Brit video (all of them are good) However, I have been getting pretty bored with how frequent the “stock” images are used, it feels like there are more image use than actual gameplay footage
Devs trying so hard to balance the game but forgets to see the balanced part of the game
This is not a cult
This changes the definition of "The house always wins"
100% not a cult Subscribed by choice
This is not a cult 🙈🙉🙊.
This is absolutely a cult
he should've chosen the Guillotine essence and go with it xd
My best build was using the Cards. When you get enough of the cards, along with Card Sharks and Jesters, and combine it with Eldritch Creatures (Mine were at like +40 or something) and each suit suddenly gave like 100 a pop, I would make around 3k per spin.
This is not a cult, just a clever use of public good will 🫖
The ritual daggers are for aesthetics
Essences will be added back to the pool after they are destroyed.  If you disable an essence (by right clicking it) you can prevent it from being destroyed.  If you keep disabling essences you will eventually deplete the pool and then if you turn on one essence you will keep getting it back after you pay rent.  Black cat Essences gives all cats x13 so repeatedly getting black cat essence will quickly cause all your cats to have insane multipliers.  If you have a relaible way of getting more essences then you can take pizza the cat and rusty gear aswell to further increase your multiplier each rent.
The waffle house has found it's new host!
When there’s a lowercase “e” in a number I don’t know what it stands for but it basically works like this 1.8e4= 18,000 the 4 represents the amount of digits after the first number and the decimal represents the second number
yeah i remember the arrows being good never thought about just filling the machine with cultists
I smoke a spliff what watching Spiff
This is not a cult
The Waffle House has found it new host
I bet you can’t find game breaking exploit on ark survival pvp server
Yeah I think he is playing on a early version as alinsrock already did this and got like trilons maybe even quintilons
Its just sad that so many perfectly balanced strategies of old became null and void before full release.   I would have loved seeing Spiff find some of the old gems it had haha.
gotta do no mans sky again since you revisited cyberpunk
i love when LBAL is a perfectly balanced
This in not a cult!
why are your items on top and not on the sides lol.  but seriously with mods this game gets even more chaotic. there is one called Eldritch gateway, which requires alot of cultists too.
Easiest way to find bugs in your game is to tell Spiff to play the game and surely he'll find ways to broke the game
this is not a cult
This is not a cult
" this is not a cult" this is not a cult this is not a cult this is not a cult. PRAISE THE TEA
As an average spif enjoyer this is not a cult this a very nice tea drinking group
Is this on your tea cooled pc?
This is not a cult
Those are rookie numbers! Try 1 flower 19 suns
So spiff without going into endless using suns bees and flowers you can easily get a single tile giving more than 1000 gold
This is not a cult
no one tell him about midas pirates
THIS IS NOT A CULT
This is NOT a cult
it is scary
Waiting for @AliensRock to show up
really like your Videos. I am wondering if you ever thought of making one about Kenshi?
This guy has to do a video on how to exploit online casinos
My brains melted just thinking about all those multipliers and rules. I love and hate mathematics at the same time. This is not a cult.
This is a cult!  :D
Spiffing brit be like: im gonna break this game  Devs:  fixed this issue. Spiffing brit: im Gonna break this game  Devs: we will pay you 100 quid to stop. Devs: Guys so we fixed this issue….😂
After a good cup of Yorkshire tea(which I definitely had) I thought you should exploit elemental creature to kill a gnome in super auto battlemon
Im waiting for Spiff to reveal that Andrew Tate is just his player character and that we all live in a broken game that Spiff abuses
I want to see Spiff come up with a new kraken drive in KSP 2 next month
coffee is better that is all
The waffle House has found it's new host
one developer** ONE
At least you get to destroy the coffee
This is totally not a cult!
With around 70 hours in this game, it's just fucking fantastic. It's a simple, enjoyable game full of silly interactions and infinitely scaling combinations. My highest score before I reset was 3e87.
"we love tax evasion" - TIL spiffing brit was actually just Jimmy Carr
This is a cult
So an Eldrich Cult is all that's needed to defeat the tories?
Brit: "This game is intended for us to have tenth and hundreds of coins, not thousands!"  This game: have a special thing to kill you if you get a billion coins. Also this game: have a special counter for when this happens, so you won't lose count
Bees flowers rain is an op build also
don't worry it's not a cult, it's just business, British Business
Oh, just a mere 52 million with a cult  Have you heard of 75 quintillion with cats?
This was a cult.
this is not not not a cult

If you get the Billionaire relic the game kills you at $1b.
This is not a cult
This is defiantly a cult, and I love it.
Didnt even make billions per spin... 0/10 I'll have to revoke your tea privliges now.
"Games with coffee are the absolute worst!" ~me, a coffee despiser.
Hi.
This is not a cult, but if it were, you most likely would be entitled to a tax waiver for a religious organisation.
The Waffle House Has Found Its New Host
this is not a cult! not the one i was looking for!
Oi Spiff, what's with the title? A Perfectly Balanced... what? TELL ME SPIFF! WHAT IS IT?!
The Waffle House has found its new host
I was wondering when you'd cover this game, I've spent a bit of time myself playing it! Looking forward to see how you break this game and see if it's the same as my method! :P
This not a cult, it’s a lifestyle
Well if no one is going to do it then  THIS IS NOT A CULT
This is definitely a cult. Haha
12:32 Truly, this is the darkest future.
This is a cult
I wondered when you'd get to this game
Spiff, you missed the most important exploit!  The contract with the landlord makes your rent due after so many spins. So Don’t spin at all, and live rent-free!
First run: loses 2nd run: becomes god
This is definitely not a cult, it is just the Spiffing Brit showing off he is CULTured.
Spiff, proud coffee drinker
Definitely not a cult
You know you've really broken the game when the engineering numbers start appearing.
“This is not a cult”
Idk why spiff doesn't like coffee. It's just bean tea
THIS IS NOT A CULT
This is not a cult!
💰☕️💰☕️💰
The game ends once you hit 1billion, you get guillotined
I think Spiff missed the most important thing about the coffee. It's only purpose in the game is to be destroyed, as it is supposed to be.
I regret drinking coffee I should have drank tea😭😭😭😭
Been playing this for a couple of years.  Good to see it getting some attention. It’s an entertaining little gem.
This is not a cult
Amethysts with essences can give millions in one turn.
This is not a cult
This is not a cult
Spiff is still playing this now.
THIS, IS NOT A CULT... Trust me, I'm a Doctor of Archaic Mythos and Ethos!
I have been called to speak on behalf of my brothers and sisters:  This is by no means at all, in any way, whatsoever a cult.
I guess that's pretty much how other spiffing brits did the same to hack the world economy...
What is a cult?
My dog woke me up at 2:50am and I watched this video. This may be a cult.
This is not a cult to make sure I'm not arrested take that HMRC.
1.1e4 is 11,000 you do 1.100000 and move the decimal 4 places right giving you 11,000.00 1.8e4 is 18,000 you do 1.800000 and move the decimal 4 places right giving you 18,000.00
Cults? Never heard of em. No cults here officer...
For those of you who don't know what "e4" means, I'm not explaining it cause you won't be listening.
THIS IS NOT A CULT
When 400 grand is a low roll.
I have no idea what the hell is going on with this game, but I love hearing Spiff explain it
Wait until he realizes you need 1,000,000,000 to *actually* beat the game.
this is not a cult
This is the opposite of a cult
THIS IS NOT A CULT
So....... no sun/flower build for a billion per spin?  Yawn.
Do people not know that the "e" in calculations means "times ten to the power of"?
You should do payday2😊
The "e" in that context means <number>*10^<number> so 1.8e4 = 1.8*10^4 or roughly 18000 due to the fact that the game is rounding to 1.8.
This is NOT a cult!
So spiff... I may of watched someone play this a while back and... just know... Look into the sun, rain, and plants combo.
All I saw was Spiff roleplaying a city skylines household from one of his amazing cities and their extremely high rent
Spiff doesn't destroy games, instead he is doing a massive favor to the devs by basically bug testing the game for free. And we all know that no exploit in a perfectly balanced game gets passed Spiff!
Keep going until you get a buffer overflow error
This is not a cult.
eventually(maybe after 10 years of high speed turns), maybe you will tun out of money? potentially?
Not understanding the potential of this game is fun for spiff. And he takes clover over protractor?!??!?!? What r u doing?
Of course this isn't a cult! How dare you suggest such a thing.  Here, for your trouble, would you like some TEA?
THIS IS not A CULT?
This is not a cult
Think This is created by an AI? I can't trust any Spiffing Brit Video anymore...
This is not a cult

I was waiting for him to do this game. One of my favorite chill mindless games
This is a cult.
“THIS DEFINITELY ISN’T A CULT” ☕️👌
Can u make a video about a game called unturned , it's a zombie survival game and I am wondering if there is a method for any exploits
Spiff: Subscribe you lazy bastard! Me: *gasp* I'm not a bastard!
thats no london THATS İSTANBUL LOOK MOM THEY PUT OUR HOME ON A GAME
This is not a cult
Found this game for no reason and became addicted for hours. Had to move it off my desktop...
Geologists + Oysters is absurdly broken.
☕️👌😏
Awesome video! The e stands for exponent btw, so 1e4 means 1x10^4. so basically 10.000 :)
Gotta do a flower and sun build.  It'll make this payout look tiny in comparison.
This is not a cult
This is not a cult.
Towards the end its like listening to the horses down the pub
this is not a cult
15:47 Apparently Spiff is a caribou. I thought he was British
This, is not a cult
Why no Dwarf Fortress?
THIS IS NOT A CULT.
I love that Spiff is the only person to break rent.
Ah yes, another perfectly balanced video from the spiffiest off brits *insert tea sipping noises here* Tis a fine day.
I was hoping the video would end with you getting the "Guillotine" Relic :(
Mate, I don’t drink Yorkshire tea. I’m a PG tips pyramid bag guy. Please don’t block me.
Coffee is in the game?
This is not a cult!
At this rate, Spiff might even have money left over to heat his home AND buy groceries
This is not a cult
This is definitely not a cult
М.
You and Let’s game it out, I think makes a great combo for one video.
Damn, I think this is the only time I've seen spiff get TOO excited about exploits. Nobody tell him about penny slots
This is the rare actually perfectly balanced game because despite Spiff's statements to the contrary, I'm pretty sure the dev was entirely aware of the ridiculous math the game can produce.
can you do something with manufactured spending show me ahead of time. use the money to start a new back
Spiff taking the Hex of Redium and using a removal token on it, instead of skipping, is very funny
i WOULD FOLLOW THE GRAND TEA MASTER ANYWHERE BUT ITS DEFINIETLY NOT A CULT
Idea ‘spiff kills the capitalists’
This video is #35 on trending today
Total a cult!
Coffee is awesome. This is definitely a cult, your majesty.
I vote Spiff keeps going until he is wealthier than Musk.
As someone who loves spiffs videos, I’m so happy to be part of this family, which is in no way a cult. Not a cult at all.
THIS IS NOT A CULT
I'm so glad this isn't a cult. Oh no. Nope. Definitely not...
This is not a cult
THIS IS NOT A CULT
This gets even more fun after you unlock essences and combine the Eldritch Creatures with insane buffed Wildcard Cats. I have 16-37k multipliers on my wildcards and can easily get 1e8 (even 1e9 if I'm lucky) coins per spin.
that was only the first floor thought .....
In a dystopian world where rent doubles every time you pay rent, Spiff becomes the landlord
"7.7e4 is my favourite quantity of gold coins" - Spiff

This is maybe not a cult
but if it was a cult you could claim tax exemption for a religion.
Such a great game. If you wanna see something truly wild, go for cats or flower synergy. Multiplicative scaling can go way further than it did in this video
This is NOT a CULT (They got devoured)
Unsubbing He drink Coffee now, I though you can do better spiff
The power of selling your soul to an eldritch horror!
Your video always make me feel thirsty because u keep mentioning tea hahaha 🤣
This not a cult!
This is definitely not a cult
In France there's a rule of thumb that says "anything in Paris is twice as expensive as anywhere else in the country". In the UK, it's basically twice that much. When Spiff gets involved, it's beyond anyone's pay grades. Spiff is the black hole of finance: anything that comes close never comes out.
This isn't a cult, our lord Spiff guaranteed it to all of his followers.
this is not a cult
this aint a cult
we need more of this

Just a while ago I saw a meme on 9gag... "Imagine being a small game developer, and your game is played on youtube by a huge youtuber. (good) Then you realize it is a Spiffing Brit (oh damn... here we go debugging :D)

Mao had some good ideas on what you do with landlords.

this is a cult get me out of here
This is not a cult brother....
"This is not a cult"
I love drinking black rifle while watching spiff, good stuff👌🏼👌🏼
does this exploit also work in real life Sir
Definitely not a cult.
e4 means the number before it times 10 to the power of 4 so: "1.1e4 = 1.1 * 10^4"
So in short, to get infinite money, I need to turn to the dark arts and summon a(few) eldritch abomination? Sounds like a good weekend plan.
This is a cult!
Am I allowed to watch the video while drinking coffee?
Look on the bright side spiff! You get to destroy the coffee whilst continuing to drink the glorious yorkshire gold!
THIS IS NOT A CULT

This game was an absolute ton of fun.
The game is martingayling you. It will keep doubling the rent until it will eclipse your construction. It might take a long time.
you always do early access games now do genshin impact
The Waffle House has found it's new host
A rare example of Spiff just playing the game as intended. Once Spiff manages to trigger the Essence of Guillotine he'll be able to brag that he broke the game by getting too much money.  Spiff: _plays on Endless mode_ Spiff: "The game just won't end!"
just wait till he finds out about the pirate midas combo
If I'm remembering what I was taught back in high school correctly the "e" means times 10 to the power of the next number, so 3.5e5 would be 3.5 x 10 to the power of 5, I think at least. Anyone smarter here please correct me if I'm wrong, it's been a while since I've had to do math.
Hey Spiff, have you received your tea cooled PC yet? If not can't wait for a possible unboxing. Also have you checked out @BrotherMunro channel? He has done a couple of Spiff perfectly balanced inspired videos on Ultimate Admiral Dreadnoughts, pretty fun to watch.
This is nooot a cult…
This is definitely cult
mmmmmmm coffee
mathematician here, just dropping by to unveil the mystery of "e", e means exponent and basically tells us to multiply the number in front of it by 10 to the power of the number after the e, so for example 1.8e4 means 1.8 * 10 ^ 4 = 1.8 * 1,000 = 18,000
It is as the devs intended   because there is an item that kills you  if you choose to take it  If you have too much money. Like they knew infinity was possible
I love watching this cult... err, game. Obviously this is not a cult.
Could you attempt to make a broken build in the game Gunfire Reborn? There are some wild combos you can make in that game
This is totally a cult.
That landlord is making BANK

The a little bit of shenanigans line made my tea hand quiver.
The Spiffing Brit got nothing on Northernlion's 1 Trillion spin
This is not a cult, i  can seriously believe that statement, and you should too.
This is not a cult ya know, it's just business
13:00 spiff choosing a coffee?? This is definitely made by an AI 😂
The cult of the flower is stronger
Btw E4 means *10⁴ so 1.8e4 is 18000
Cult of Yorkshire tea????? No officer we all just casually drink coffee together, ignore the eldritch horror in the corner for your sake, he REEEEEAAAALLLLLYYYY likes tea, I mean coffee
This is NOT a cult!
This is not a cult.
E4 is just a shorthand for I can’t be bothered to write out the number so here is the number of digits between the first and the decimal, the final rent payment of 1.8E4 is 18000
There is no cult in Spiff's comments sections.
This is NOT a cult

This is the best cult on youtube
One of the best games going
sorry but to be honest, at this point no one cares about exploiting childish mechanics in game unless it can generate a real money, once you started with exploiting steam/Origin/Xbox gamepass/twitch/youtube/oculus glitches to show how to make money, there is no one left who would care about your previous content, so get back to work and deliver us pure geniality once again...as Alice in wonderland once said on internet "once you see it, you can't unsee it"
Well it could end if you picked up a guillotine. It kills you the moment you get $1 Billion dollars (Or some large amount I dont remember)
Excellent video, as always.   I'm glad the devs gave Spiff the opportunity to DESTROY a cup of coffee so it may never be drunk.
I was fully expecting a "This video is brought to you by Foxtons!"
I have 150 hours in the game from just playing occasionally over the past year and the dev has been very dedicated to it. New content, constant bug fixes, and I don't think I've even seen a bug personally ever. Worth the buy for sure.

THIS IS INDEED NOT A CULT
Boys this is the least cult-like thing I have ever seen, it's more like a big warm family because tea brings everyone together like one big happy family.
Destroying the coffee item makes perfect sense to me. It doesn't say consume, it says *destroy.* So less brewing machine, more burning it in hellfire.
This is not a cult.
This is totally a tea cult
God damn how much a house cost?
This is TOTALLY a Cult.
this is definitely a cult
At least at some point there was a diamond build, which was even more ridiculous
Is Jimmy Carr a relative Spiff?
I like how this isn't even an exploit, just Spiff enjoying a wonderful game
i have to unsubscribe The Spiffing Brit choose coffee 🥲
who else actually grabs a cup of tea when The Spiffing Brit says so?
One would think, you could buy some real estate with such money ... but no, we will still pay rent ... 😅
THIS IS NOT A CULT
Great game. I was able to get the guillotine essence to trigger twice meaning the game ended because I earned 2,000,000,000 gold in one run. My winning roll was over 1,000,000,000.
I'm four minutes in and I feel like this is just, so far, the spiffing brit against The Spriffing Brit........
Ah.. two very nice things in this video: game exploit and coffee!
Perfectly balanced.
Is a perfectly balanced-  The title maximum was too short, Spiff was cut off
I very much enjoyed this video but when you said "1.8e4, that's about 40k" it caused me physical pain...
This is not a cult
This is not a cult! We worship him, because we want to
Guess what: The waffle house found it's new host
This is clearly not a cult
e is for exponent, that is to say to to the power of the number after the e. So 1e4 is 10000 and so on
Later in the game you can get red relics that permanently double the value of the hex pieces and you can do that repeatedly to make virtually infinite money.
Who knew that the only way to pay rent was to join a cult and participate in sacrificial rituals?

This is totally not a cult.
This is not a cult, this is an education program about game expl--design.  As such you should instead give Spiff a nice tax break under educational benefaction laws, not taking away like he was some street vendor with a fancy new cart!
Ha! Cult? Psssh, nah…
did you know there's an achievement if you make a Flower give at least 19,073,486,328,125 coins?

the dame, miner, geologist and golem combo can go infinite too, i wouldnt really call these strats exploits though
I've got a fun clip on my channel on twitch of getting 1.5 quadrillion in a single spin on apartment floor 15. You think the game is broken now? Wait till you hit essences. Then you just end the game with the billionaire essence yjat kills you when you have 1billion or more coins
This is not a cult.
This is not a cult!
Idk if youll see this the spiffing brit but I absolutely love your comment I even shouted you out on my channel it's not a large channel but hey your my favorite YouTuber and I said the spiffing brit will be proud of me because I have my tea here with me honestly can drink 8 gallons of tea a week best drink hands down I hope you see this I watch all your videos keep hating coffee keep drinking tea
17 seconds in, Spiff is already being realer than anyone else on YouTube.

How do you make it so you have to pay rent in endless mode?  He changed it just before release and now its just... endless and boring >.<
Watching with my yorkshire gold
Cult? There is no such thing here
Definitely not a cult *blink* *blink* *blink*
I get bored after about probably 5 or 6 payments only four fact that every time you meet the quarter you all of a sudden have to pay double the next time and technically I would say that rent or every time you spin it is 30 days gone down the month so it's not really paying rent it's just a gambling game and that's kind of no fun
This is not a cult

Cultists!?  Really?  What with amazing things like Pear and Chef that can be busted to give hundreds of billions of gold per spin this is what you came up with?
THIS IS NOT A CULT
This is not a cult.
Considering he doesn't even have essences yet and is just doing a normally intended synergy... I think it's safe to assume Spiff has only just cracked the surface of the absurdities of this game.

This is just a life-accurate simulator of how billionaires make money
This is not a cult I willingly do Everything
oh spiff, you've seen nothing yet. last time i saw this game, there was a certain item you would probably enjoy: if you make too much money in one spin... something... happens. Heck, in one of the freemium mobile clones, a clone strategy can earn me 50+ million per spin, no consistency issues beyond initial setup.
THIS IS NOT A CULT
This is a cult. You are invited.

Great work interns!
This is not a cult, I swear. You can even say it's a perfectly balanced communitea.
e means 10^, so 1.9e4 is 19000
I could comment that I find it strange that you decided on a build that scales linearly but I think it would be better to bring up the fact that the relic "guillotine" kills billionaires... And getting a billion cash is absolutely possible...
You took the tea of coffee bean!
This is a cult, I mean not... it's not a cult
To people that haven’t seen this game before, this is YouTuber luck

Please your Majesty, you must understand, as a mere colonist, I see Mr. Spiffing as a cultural boon to the British people in a time of their most desperate need to be distracted from the most excellent economic policies, and as a member of his family from even across the pond, the occasional eldritch mass borne of our numbers are all well attenuated to be loyal to whatever fancies your heart may flutter hearthwhit.

They should call it San Francisco the game.

If spiff ever played warframe. He would 1000% be allied with the corpus.

What version of the game is this?
2 Dames, a few amethysts, the gambler,. jokers, a few suit, symbols and arrows can easily break 1,000,000 coins consistently  in endless. I absolutely love this game.
This is not a Cult. Just here have some kool-aid and relax.
It would have been cool to try and crash the game with an integer overflow from making too much money.  Either way, great vid!
Glory to Spiff. The Leader of "This is not a Cult". The best cult I've been in. 11/10
This is definitely not a cult, really.

“More gold than the game thinks you should be generating” I see The Spiffing Brit has not witnessed the greatness of The Cat Build
This might be a cult I'll let you know.
12:29 Ahhhhhh the ultimate conundrum for Spiff, Drink coffee for money exploits? Or forsake the Coffee and remain poor? 🤣😂🤣😂 Life demands that you sacrifice your loyalty to Tea for money!!
Lol don't know if it's still in the game, I saw someone break this game before using sun's and flowers (I know there was another item or 2) but he kept stacking sun's and then he got an item to buff every item from 1, he kept playing and then the game itself crashed
Spiff might not be in a cult, but he *is* a Cul-tea-st.
Luck be a Spiffing Brit
The moment when you witness Spiff use one of the worst synergies in one of your favorite games. Can't wait till he discovers cats and their essence potentials.  What if instead of an eldritch paying you over a hundred, all of your thirteen plus cats, which is also a wildcard, gave you X300?
Hmm yes… this is definitely not a cult ☕️
The most broken build I know is using cats I've gotten trillions per spin with it
this is (not) a cult
This is not a cult
It's not an exploit, it's "the free market."  (And huge stacks like this are the fun of this kind of game but the especially strong ones are always entertaining!)
This is not a cult.  Mormons don't drink tea.
this isn't even that broken of a build honestly, should see flowers build
This is bot a cult
This is not a cult
wait till you see essences
I had a game going where I had like 9 amethysts running +300 and over as well as 3 or 4 dames which would constantly double upon double their value
The most money i made in this was when i had flower and rest of board was sun + item that say Sun and Moon affect non-adjacent symbols as well.  it was about 2bilion on one spin

1.8e4 which is basically 40 grand. Maths
The strange grammar in the end of this title makes me suspect it was secretly written by an AI generator again 🤔🤔
Spiff, nice cult, however I am severely underwhelmed by the lack of lucky wildcard cats that generate 10,000x the money of your highest paying symbol, please make a second video demonstrating the true power of cats
Love thusb

You never fail to amase me with all the ways youe break games

This is not a Cult
This IS a cult....mwahahaha
Spiff you can win this game with anything I won a run with billionaires and wine.
"This is not a cult"😉
That's quite broken. However, not quite flower/sun combo broken. 1,000,000,000 per spin is the true luck be a landlord experience.
love this game beat a bunch
This is not a cult. It is a gambling promotional video.
It's OK Spiff, the game doesn't say you have to drink the coffee. In fact, it rewards you with an extra spin when you eventually destroy it!
this IS  a cult
I hope Spiff will never find out that cat is far superior compared to dog in this game
This is totally a cult

If this was a cult I wouldn't have found an exploit to eternal life
Sure, Harry Potter may be “The Boy Who Lived” but Spiff is legendarily “The Boy Who Made Rent”
It hurts my brain seeing non pixelated text in this game lol
It was a fun watch, but where is the exploit? This just seems like a normal way to play.
mining spirals even further out of control
this is not a cult. Isn't that right everyone?
Nice Video!
The highest I've gotten in one roll is 221 million :D
This is not a cult
Wow. This video has spent a good amount of time in productikn
The incomplete video title is a perfectly balanced..... mistake.
What a dumb game. What a dumb video
Is he playing in mobile or something? It looks diffrent
11:40 "More than the game intends for you to be generating" he says.... Oh you poor unfortunate soul, this is barely the beginning of the insane scaling that can happen in this game
YOOO this game is absolutely fantastic
This probably isn't a cult
Spiff you need to try buffing flowers with rain and sunshine
It can’t be a cult there is 2 cups of coffee
This is a religious organization which should be exempt from taxation. This is not a cult.

Amazing video, I have enjoyed playing this game through early access and really happy to see you break it apart :)
A Perfectly Balanced What?
This is such a family friendly video on this absolutely family friendly channel, that in no way, shape or form is anything that could be even remotely be compared with those groups called a cult. There's absolutely no cults here, no sir! Just move along, only high brow, cultured, exalted tea and crumpets connoisseurs are here!
cant wait for him to discover guillotine essence, black cat essence, popsicle and telescope.
This video was made by an AI
THIS IS DEFINITELY, POSITIVELY, COMPLETELY NOT A CULT.
This is not a cult...It's not a Sunflower build, so not a cult yet.  Honestly, the Sunflower build is disgusting, assuming it still works like it used to.  Clear Skies, 19 Suns and 1 Flower used to give 5^19 gold per spin (roughly 1.9e13), which was the highest possible payout without using a Midas Bomb.  Granted, that was close to a year ago, and there have been plenty of updates since then, so it's likely that some of that has changed.
Having played/broken this game in the past myself... the numbers really won't surprise me. I remember getting trillions per roll being very very possible with certain builds. Like Midas and Pirates but I remember that if you get all the cat items... cats get insane, basically become wildcards that then double their own value.
The wafflehouse has found its new host.
This Not a cult!
He says exploits, but really these are all dev intended.
This is not a cult, possibly
I am in your cult.  That's what you wanted me to say...right?
To be fair, if you somehow manage to *lose* a run where you have the Swapper, you've done something terribly, terribly wrong.  Or terribly, terribly hilarious, like used a Midas Bomb to nuke your flowers.
Are you going to do a video on your pc from Linus tech tips
Wait till Spiff finds out the Guilotine Essence
a legitimately great game. one of my favorite roguelikes! (is it a roguelike?)
This is not a cult, this is in fact actually a genius playing a video game.
This is not a cult and we are not locked in a compound in Yorkshire.
I think it to short, love seeing ur exploit for 30mins+ hearing ur voice is good for controlling my anxiety, time to watch the old vid I guess
perfectly normal LBaL run honestly. I'm partial to fruits or gems builds.
It's official, Spiff loves coffee

It turns out Spiff was the true eldritch horror all along
I didn't know this game had sci notation. Neat
This is not a cult. My lord sir spiffington the 1st said so. Praise be.
This is not a cult.
btw u missed an opportunity u can kill urself in the game with the guillotine and reaching a billion or what it was. u can do that with any scaling engine in the game.
this is not a cult
I enjoy Luck Be A Landlord, have been playing it for a fair while. But this is just gameplay as intended.
we should show him the 75 quintillion spin
Hun, you can go into the billions before you even hit endless mode. It's been done before
It might be hard to believe, but this run was only pretty good. Yo haven’t unlocked essences, and while eldritch creature stack pretty well, but they only can get 2x multipliers, while there are some that can get up to 5x multipliers.
this is definitely a cult!!!!!
video slightly less impressive than usual bc when i played this game a while ago, even on max ascension it was fairly easy to win
this is not a cult       glory to lord and savior spiff

This is a cult. Umm, I mean not a cult of course!
now take it even further with essences

The game could really do with an exponentially and/or polynomially scaling endless mode aside the linear one, I know for sure there's a market which'll love this sort of blowing up exponential interactions pitted against appropriate challenge
This is not a cult
This is not a cult.
spiff you gotta explore the use of pears, farmers, chefs, and arrows. used that run earlier and was pulling out a million per spin
Our great leader has instructed me to inform the unblessed that this is infact, not a cult

Wonder if you can crash the game if you play long enough.
I like that time is measured in spins of the slot machine. This implies that if you never spin the machine, you never have to pay rent

This is *-NOT-* a cult. This is *-NOT-* occult. This is *-NOT-* worth investigating. This is *-NOT-* a secret message. … Tea is wonderful. That is all.
I have zero clue what this game is about, but Spiff makes it entertaining.... of course, I wouldn't have bought a few of the games I own without your videos... Skyrim and Divinity Original Sin 2 among them.
The algorithm literally recommended this to me FIVE TIMES in two minutes on the same timeline. Fuck it, fine.
Can't wait until the spiffing brit discovers essences in the higher levels of the game, and in particular a very specific essence that only activates when you have earned an obscene amount of money...
We Love t̶a̶x̶ ̶e̶v̶a̶s̶i̶o̶n̶ Perfectly Balanced Games with No Exploits!!
I can confirm that the family friendly Spiffco family is not, never will be, and never has been a cult. Praise be Spiff
But who is exploiting who?? 🤔 The game made to have the most busted ass combos imaginable, or the flesh based tea man?
Everybody knows that if anyone says 'this is not a cult' it's a cult!
Spiff: aha, 50k a spin, I've broken this game! Me, an aliensrock viewer who watched him get 75 quintillion spins: oh, how quaint..
I've been playing this game for a while now. Very fun.
I love being part of this amazing  “community”
This is not a cult!
The waffle house has found its new host
This is not a cult
In the next video he will exploit real life.
This is not a cult!
This is definitely definitely a cult.
The best video I've ever seen, it can't be made by a cult
This is not a cult
He told us all to type: This is not a cult; in the comments.
Even from across the pond, I can see very clearly that this is not a cult.
this would be a cult if you could expoit the fact of it being a cult or is it a cult
you know the meaning of "e4" in numbers? it means you just have to move the decimal place 4 digits to the right... so 1,9e4 = 19000... that easy... ^^
if you have to clarify that it's not a cult, it's most likely a cult.
wtf is this trash game lol, its just a gambling add
Day 1 of asking Spiff to play Valheim
Stacking multipliers!? Who do they think they are, Cyberpunk developers???
this is not a cult
This is (not) a cult
I've killed myself multiple times for becoming a billionaire by using Mrs. Fruit+Compost Heap+Watering Can and also Cats with various items and essences to turn them into wildcards and give 13x more money if you can get 13 cats on screen.
If I've learned anything from PointCrow, it's that if we are told to say "we are not a cult", our response should always be "we are a cult"
Spiff Zedong
Dave had finally won
THIS IS NOT A CULT
This is a great game, I hope you do a couple videos on it.
Coffee is life.
Love you Spiff but this game looks like absolute trash :(
This isn't a cult. This is just a community that only exists to prase the godlike exploits of an individual. Possibly owning and coveting items in the individual's likeness or symbolic likeness
THIS IS NOT A CULT
Since this is not a cult, there is no cult leader to tell us to comment " this is not a cult".
Flower a ton of suns and clear skies is stupidly ridiculous
Lol I love spiff freaking out over a p standard run, he should look into all the stuff you can do with cats.... now _thats_ broken
oh please. anyone who follows retro or alien will know how easily this game gets broken in half.. on the higher flor with the essences you can get permanent multiplications on symbols, and items like telescope, rusty gear, conveyor belt and protractor are just completely broken regardless. there is an essence that if you hit 1 billion dollar you die. and that isnt even that hard to get. so it might actually be the way the devs intended it to go,
as a spiff enjoyer i can totally unbiased guarantee that this is NOT a cult
More games should use scientific notation
This is definitely a cult of tea drinkers
It kind of hurt to see spiff miss the protractor
I love Luck be a Landlord... but if you wanna get crazy, flower & suns with a periscope and protractor.
Ah yes, the start of converting Spiff into a coffee drinker!
clear sky, 19 sun 1 flower =5^19 with one day
atleast coffie is destroyd not drank
This is not a cult
This is not a cult!
There are so many inuendos pertaining to the Spiffing Brit channel while he plays this game. This is like the most Spiffing Brit video and game I have ever seen Spiff play, yet!
everyones talking about all the synergies but cats are literally the most broken symbol
As a fellow Spiff Sipper I do enjoy myself colonizing ethnic minorities.
How much gold do you pay spiff for your TV license?
If only this worked in real life... who am I kidding the Casino owners would bury the first person in the desert and "fix" the exploit.
Even with all his exploits he couldn’t become a home owner. Dystopian indeed.
This is totally, absolutely, positively not a perfectly balanced cult. 😉👌
I remember the first time I played this and got the giga money. I managed to get the entire board filled with suns, a single flower, and suns affected non adjacent tiles as well. So every spin I made 5.9604645e16 or 59,604,645,000,000,000.....now that is true power. Only way it could have gotten better is if the suns were made of tea.
I am definitely not a member of the cult of spiff.... PLEASE HE-
I am most certainly not a member of a cult
Asbestos, it's the bestost
The fact that spiff doesn't know how scientific notation works is hilarious.
None tell spiff about the Sun and Sunflower. He is too powerful already.
That was a financial times graph shown to start with. Honestly, I could fully believe Spiff would be a great editor for the financial times. Producing reports on the Steam economy and the affect of games as a whole.  Spiff for premium financial times membership 2023
honestly my favourite build is omelettes
When my flat mate sees me playing this game I scream at him "I don't have a problem, you have a problem!!!"
This is definitely a cult. However, there were no exploits here, just good old fashioned intended gameplay.
"We Love Tax Evasaion" -Spiff
this is not a cult
It’s strange there weren’t any essences, I’m sure it could’ve blown up even more
There's other great exploits in this game like nothing but suns and a single flower. Sadly they changed endless mode to have free rent
i hope spiff doesnt find out the 19 suns + 1 flower + telescope trick
Do eldritch horrors technically count as tax evasion?  I feel like that might fall into some form of extenuating circumstances.  I'm no lawyer though,  good luck!
Lol the commies allow you to erase and roll for new symbols.
this is not a cult
Just wait til spiff unlocks essences... they make the numbers get way larger, way faster... after finishing the video, i must say to spiff, ONLY 52 million? those are rookie numbers
This is not a cult.
this is definitively not a cult
This is not a cult

"Don't worry I can pay rent this time." Every rent payer
The exploits MUST be good if Spiff momentarily considered allowing the detested *bean soup* into the perfectly balanced shenanigans.
TIS IS NOT A CULT

At this rate buy your own property and BECOME the landlord
Clearly not a cult
What am I watching? I missed the first bit
he gamblin game
This is totally a cult!!!
This is Not a cult
A RIVAL CULT?!? Our dear leader Jim Pickens won't be pleased...
Bruh, a 4% year over year increase in rent is only worthy of comment if it's less than inflation in general, which it's not. Rent is rising slower than other prices. And if you don't like inflation, ask your royal liege lord to stop printing money to pay for stupid social programs you can't afford maybe. Asking Euro serfs to understand economics is such a tall ask though.
Super auto pets is a perfectly balanced game!
Meta commentary is so worthy
Nobody tell him that Aliensrock got 75 quitilion in 1 spin.
well, if you think about it tea is ultimately leaf soup while coffee is bean soup. Meaning they're both soup so they're the same.
I actually love this game
_blinks rapidly_ This is not a cult. _continues blinking_
Does it annoy anyone else how spiff instant destroys the hexes rather than using Eldrich creatures plus the dove to guarantee a much higher stack?  Yes I do get that some of the hexes are quite bad but by a point he has holy water. Just saying the run could be more broken
this is not a cult
Just wait until he sees the game has achievements for becoming a billionaire
Def a cult
Haha perfectly balanced as all things should be
THIS IS NOT A CULT!
exist MORE POWERFUL way to generate MORE money , like 10^9+  on every spin  : artifacts- moon and sun works not only on closest, but globally and some bunny/rabbit artiacts  3-6(or some) * 5^(numbers of moons) in late 1 bunny and others is moon . Yes in this video you use ARIFMETICAL progression, THIS build has GEOMETRY progression, but his more harder  I'm see this on other youtuber (Warlok TD) (yes I'm Ukrainian and anderstand russian)
This is a cult
Clearly not a cult.
Tea
this is not a cult, he is merely my glorious leader of spiritual and life fulfilment
The Melon Husk way of doing the economy!
Coffee isn't that bad Spiff. I'm drinking it while working night shift to not get sleepy.
This is definitely not a cult, I’m certainly not a member.
This is a cult
Not a cult this is.
This is not a cult. I've been in a cult, I'd know...not this one, this isn't a cult. But if it was, I'd know.
Never forget the day The Spiffing Brit took coffee when offered it. 😂
This is not a cult! ... ... ... can I go home now?
Ah  yes, all I need to pay  real life rent is infinite money exploit... I am a dumass for not noticing until now
No Cult here , move along nothing to see here.
Pet the dog for over a minute? Oo
cmon spiff you gotta at least go into the quintillion like alienrocks
Proud to be part of Spiff's cult.
This is, as a matter of fact, not a cult. Just a merry band of beastmasters and eldritch horrors.
This is definitely not a cult!
10:36 Military generals be like...
"This is not a cult."  What?  I did as you asked!  OW!  Those quotes don't mean anything, it's just a way of OWOWOW!!!  QUIT IT!  Look, no one is going to...wait, what have you got there?
This isn't a cult. 😂
This is not a cult, just an exclusive and devoted communitea which is not being controlled by exploits
This is not a cult!
This is not a cult
This is not a cult
As an explanation for all those who don’t know when ‘e’ is used in a number it represents how many zeros come after the number in front.  For example:  1.1e4 is 1.1x10000 = 11000 2.5e7 is 2.2 x 10000000 (a one with 7 zeros after it) = 22000000
This is not a cult, but I'm amazed spiff gave up protractor for 4-leaf clover. Protractor is way better, it makes all symbols adjacent to a eldritch creature every few spins
😀
For the algorithm
When you said "exploit" I was expecting you to show us a Cat build. Cats can generate so much money that the game will crash. I'm talking about a single cat that makes multiple Decillion gold per spin...  Yes...decillion is a real number. Million Billion Trillion Quadrillion Quintillion Sextillion Septillion Octillion Nonillion Decillion
Never thought I'd see the day you'd actually be tempted by coffee... The developers had to have done that intentionally!  -Said a coffee drinker.
I’m curious how long it would take you to get a billion.
definitely not a cult... spiff fhatgen...
Why why why did you buy the coffee? There was no need for that. And you even bought a second one when we didn´t look. 😭
Soiff + any game = finding every bug to make content and help the creators
OMG I lOVE this game and how much YOU LOVE this FUN and GREAT and AWESOME game!!!
This is not a cult
Invoking the forces of darkness and cosmic horrors to pay rent. Just how I was taught! This is not a cult.
This is NOT a cult
Just broke $1 Billion on endless with amethysts and dames.
I love watching this not cult go crazy with things that you do when you're not in a cult 👀
Best way to understand the creature: its main body resides under the board, thus feeding its tendrils increases its size and strength. That's why it never loses its value, only increases each sacrifice.
This is not an cult.
This is not a cult!
God help us all if he finds out about the cats and eldritch creature strat
It's not tax evasion if you're a religion.
THIS IS NOT A CULT
Spiffing makes me, whose parents are fully english, want to try drinking yorkshire gold again, that i havent drank for...roughly 10 years
this is definitely not a cult
100% not a cult.  Trust Spiff, give him your likes, and wear the novelty cult robes with pride!
We have to think big
This is not a cult
This is a legitimate tax exempt religion
Spiff thinking 1.8 e4 is about 40k without realizing 1.8 e4 is just a notaion for 18k.
This is not a cult.
I'll have to check on my old game if it's still available. I had an insane run that was ongoing and seemed like it would never end. It was some combo that involved a gem and something that worked off of it.
There is way more crazy stuff in this last time I played it. Telescope and rusty gear with suns and a flower gave you more than the game could process lol
This is not a cult
As someone who actually plays this game, a run like his in endless mode is really not that hard to achieve and he didn't use anything that was an exploit. A bit disappointed honestly.

That moment when a game is so balanced that the master exploiter's best exploit is to just play the game as intended by picking symbols that have synergies
This is most certainly not a cult 😂
This is not a cult
I don't understand how a slot machine has anything to do with being a landlord. This would have made more sense if it was a casino and you had to pay property tax or something. This correlation just isn't there
Not a cult.
If you really think about it. This is actually a VERY generous Landlord. Yeah, the rent may go up very rapidly every 5 spins... But think about it... really carefully... It's only after 5 SPINS (not weeks or months)...   So, if you never spin the machine those 5 times, you NEVER have to pay rent. And you can stay at the apartment indefinitely. It's like the ultimately-generous Landlord; who just, REALLY dislikes people who gamble, and are trying to teach any would-be gamblers a lesson. While they're at it, they might as well make some coin on the side too; from the people who don't "get it", and use some of that money to cover the people who do.  ALSO... To sum, up Scientific Notation (the weird numbering sequence in the game), for anyone who doesn't know... the e[N] part of the number is basically how many decimals you need to move from the first number, to know what your actual number is. If it's a positive number you move your decimal right, if it's a negative number, you move it left. one quick example is: 1.56 e6 == 1,560,000 whereas 1.56 e-6 == 0.00000156  This is a simplified explanation to help us normal plebs (or people who didn't quite get to that part in their math-classes yet) to make sense of all the "powers of 10 math" that goes on behind the scenes.  It's a good way to make larger numbers easier to fit on a screen, that's for sure... and one possible way to prevent the integer-stack-overflows that spiff usually finds in his exploits. Just the fact that the game includes Scientific Notation in the coding at all may very-well mean that the devs DID expect people to hit such numbers, and needed a way to display them on their screen. Or it could just be inherent in modern coding programs, it's been DECADES since I worked with coding, and even then it was only in a Java Coding-Class at college, so I'm WAY out of the loop here. lol
THIS IS NOT A CULT
This is not a cult
This game is madness. I don't remember the exact combination- it was either essence cat copycats or geologist oysters, probably essence cats now that I think on it- I grabbed the essence guillotine and earned a billion. That was months ago, but yeah, it's incredible, this game is made to be broken by supercombos.
Surprised Spiff didn't find or show finding the guillotine item that auto loses the game for you when you get  enough money. Would have been a great ending, but now we can all imagine it going on forever.
12:37 it's a failed anti spiff device
The Waffle House Has Found Its New Host
For anyone wondering, '"e" is a sybol used in math to indicate how many zeroes you have to add to the number. For example 1.6e5 is 160000.
As a dedicated and subservient tea drinker, I can confirm, beyond any shadow of any doubts, that this is not a cult.
This is not a cult. We just like coffee.

UNSUB COFFEE TRAITOR
this is not a cult
I don't think this is a cult.
imagine being a developer and you hear that spiff featured your game on his channel💀💀
spiffing brit, i dont know if you know, but if you manage to gather some absurd amounts of money (and when i say absurd i mean absurd, i think it is 10^300 something like that) you get to "inf" money. I'm sure you'll find this information intresting. edit: also if you want me to tell you the best ways to get to this absurd point, i can tell you, but i'm sure you would want to find out by yourself ;)
Definitely not a cult.  Definitely something worse though.+
Drink tea, Exploit games, evade taxes  This is not a cult
this is not a cult!
This is ABSOLUTELY a cult!
I can only imagine the dread the game developers feel when their games makes it on to spiffs page lol
A game where making absurd amounts of money by breaking everything is the core concept. Almost like someone made it especially for you. :D
Clearly this is not a cult. My family is completely safe and living their best life deep within spiff headquarters of their own volition. I am happy and grateful for the kindness of the spiffing brit, and have no motivation for taking legal action, and rescind my right to according to the waiver that I signed of my own free will.
1.8e4 is 1.8×10⁴, or 18,000.
this is not a cult <(0.o)>
Will you do a cult of the lamb video?!?
Wait until Spiff discovers the cat beast master x13 stacking build for millions per spin
This video taught me that gambling is a great way to get out of debt!
This is not a cult
this is a very happy super duper british non-cult comunity
THIS IS NOT A CULT!!
Spiff. Think of it this way. You Destroy the coffee any time you see it. You aren't drinking it, you are obliterating it and purging coffee from the world for your own personal benefit
At this rate you could just buy a house with all that money! But you wouldn't do that would you Spiff? It would rob you of the satisfaction of knowing this puny landlord only BELIEVES he has power over you when in fact you hold all the cards, his entire economic engine being propped up by one infinitely wealthy tenant.
This is not a cult
Our cult leader said, that I have to comment "This is not a cult! "

Oh man that guy in the thumbnail...  Juan Joya Borja is an immortal meme.  May he never be forgotten.
"This" is not a cult.
This is not a cult!
quick reminder that e is scientific notation, e4 is 10000
Unfortunately Spiff didn't break the game enough.Seen other people get billions with a spin :P
Mrs. Fruit + Compost Heap + Fertilizer As she eats the fruits, it produces more seeds that instantly grow, so she can eat them.  no one tell spiff about the Guillotine Essence.
Wow, I really do like being a part of this non-cult community  Note: you will be rewarded for writing this, but don't forget to delete this part before leaving a comment
He played the game exacly as intended. I wont say its perfectly balanced, but no exploits here. And he wven skipped the geologist, wich is the most op unit in the game. My best spin in endless mode was 200 million.
Hi

46k people alredy watched this?
Backpack Hero. I wanna see you break it.
Its only been 2 hours
Tbh I love how with your videos you intentionally (or unintentionally) show the real workings behind capitalism and how it only exploits the working class.
I'm surprised you don't get the option to become a landlord yourself if you make enough money
Hey Spiff, I would recommend you try vampire survivors for exploiting.  It's a fun game all about becoming super powerful.  One of my runs I got so much happening on screen that the game itself started chugging and I was able to walk straight through walls without a problem.  If I could do that, imagine what the king of exploits and tea could do.  Anyways, hope everyone has a good day.
Coffee.
* me seeing Spiff excited about 400k gold per roll *  That's adorable.  * laughs in Essence Multiplier *
This is NOT a cult! I pinky promise.
What is this perfectly balanced inflation.
nobody tell spiff that a run with 8 cultists is typically better than a few frozen fossils
It's super weird hearing "His Majesty" when I grew up hearing "Her Majesty"

Essence guillotine-spiff your money amount is low.
This is "not" a cult...
I've always despised all of those twitch "watch me do a sponsored gambling stream in which I'm just cheating the entire time," but this? This I'll watch.
Man, Spiff's reactions remind me so much of when I started playing this game. Now wait until he learns that you can actually FIGHT the landlord with money.
This is not not a cult.  A not not cult of TEA!
This is not a cult

Watching Spiff try to interpret the scientific notation was the best part of the video for me.
Lol This is not a cult.
When rent is so bad you join the Followers in Yellow.
Spiff! If you choose the coffee then you can destroy it! You do not need to live with the coffee
I like how the game seems to have a communist spin (you're contacted by a communist that helps you and the landlord is evil) but you win by basically becoming a super capitalist and making as much gold as possible, becoming stronger than the landlord and literally sacrificing people to monsters just to make more money.
Flower synergies
Coffee is far superior to tea.
Spiff has new things to break ... hurrah!.... kettle is on.
🤑 the profit ... Wow
This is not a cult.

I’ve never seen a million gold in this game… insane!
This ist Not a Cult
1e4 is 1 X 10^4. The e there is commonly known in mathematics as a  “Times by 10 to the power of the next number”. Just simplifies things. So when you paid 1e4 rent you paid £10,000
"1.1e4 what's that like 10,500 gold?" Spiff doesn't quite understand math....
ceci n'est pas une culte
THIS IS NOT A CULT
one day, Spiff will find a game with no exploits, that day the Queen will raise from the dead and take back her thrown, tea will overtake coffee and all cat girls will become real

Spiff got destroyed from the inside after buying that one cup of coffee.
As an avid player since way way back in the day, Cultists and Card Suits were the two dominant strategies in early alpha. These strategies have been nerfed into the ground not only by making the symbols in question worse, but also by adding more symbols to the game and thus reducing the likelihood of actually getting the symbols you are going for in any reasonable time. For example you need to get enough cultists to reliably get 3 of them for them to be worth staying in the deck. And at higher difficulties that doesn't happen too often.
This is not a cult and great content Spiff
Black cat essence is 13x for all cats. Get like 20 of those and some other 2x buffs and rusty gears you're looking at 1.0e30+ old per turn.
THIS IS NOT A CULT!   Also, for those who can't do math:  2.2e4 = 22,000.  The basic formula is this:  XeN.  This is computer code for dealing with numbers too big to fit on screen.  You mulitply X by 10^N, which is equivalent to moving the decimal point N spaces to the right.  So 2.2e4 = 22,000 like I said.  Then 2.2e5 = 220,000.  And 2.2e6 = 2,220,000.  And so on.  If N is a negative number, you move the decimal point to the left instead of to the right.  2.2e-4 = 0.00022.  2.2e-5 = 0.000022.  And so on.
Next up: The Prime Minister Election is perfectly balanced with no exploits
YES I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO COVER THIS GAME!
I alway thought that having a cult was CallmeKevin's thing, but apparently The Spiffing Brit can make good use of them too...  ...Just be careful of the glorious Dear Leader Jim Pickens... (He tends to get aggressive towards other cults...)
this is not a cult!!
As a proud member of Spiff's cult, I am obligated to say that this is not a cult
This is not a cult, (although I think your missing a trick spiff religion is tax exempt.)
For sure, the cult of Spiff is not a cult
Most certainly not a cult
It should be alarming when someone tells you to announce that this is not a cult. Ah well.
This is totally not a cult ;)
But wait, it says "destroy this item" in the game. Thus you choosing the coffee, meant you chose to destroy it! XD
Ah... Spiff Shenanigans for the win.   What could go wrong?

If you think this is broken, try a Flower + Sun build with the Clear Sky item. 1 Flower and 19 Suns, and the Flower will make you 19,073,486,328,125 coins per spin. There's an achievement for it, too! Also make sure to check out the later Apartment Floors, they go up to 20 and each one makes the game more challenging. You can unlock powerful limited-time items called Essences, as well as a Boss Fight against the Landlord.

Oh god, this game is frighteningly similar to my REAL LIFE - doing crazy stuff for people I don't even like, just so I can pay my rent every month, and every time I pay my rent they raise it higher.   This game makes me want to go find a dark corner to curl up and have a good cry.
This is, in fact, not a cult. Fr fr no cap
THIS IS NOT A CULT!
This is not a cult....its a social club!
A much better build that I went to a million with is Dames and Amethysts. Dames buff gems nearby and Amethysts accumulate value whenever they are buffed. You can get absurd amounts of money from them.
Spiff I challenge you to defeat northernlion's record. It can't be that hard.... Right?
this is not a cult.... i guess
Unfortunately for spiff the record for money on a single spin is somewhere on the order of 50 quintillion or so which makes him a bit of a newbie in the rent paying market.

Screw the corporate landlords! Stiff them on the rent and exploit the law and procedures to stay somewhere rent free as long as possible!

That's not tax evasion. That's the way tax law works. Those that know the game find the loopholes and more money they make the more loopholes they find. It's not a bug it's a feature. Otherwise it would be called wage theft with extra steps.
this is not a cult
I've tried many times to get a cultist run, it has never worked. Just get like 3 and game just decides it will never ever happen again.
Should be renamed "Tory Simulator".

The 1e4 is a scientific notation: means 1*10^4 = 1*10 000 = 10 000. It is also used for both very small numbers ( aka 1e-4 )
Whenever I see this game it always makes me laugh because its made by a youtuber I watched like a decade ago for league of legends math videos. Glad to see @TrampolineTales getting some awareness on his game.
Wait till he finds out about the suits and joker meta or the sun and rain meta with which you can make TRILLIONS

Spiffing Brit you are the absolute Best British man I’ve ever heard of you can literally make anything entertaining 😂
Lmao I saw the first few seconds of the video playing with no audio on my phone, and thought "man, those exact images look like the ones TheSpiffingBrit uses on his intros" Lo and behold It is you. I have watched enough of your videos to guess they're yours in the first few seconds based only on stock photos What the fuck
This is not a cult
I wanted to see whether this game has a maximum amount of money you can have. 😢I kinda got the answer in the discussions on Steam, though. Apparently the game has (or had in october 2021) a tendency to crash at ridiculous amounts of money, so probably not. Still would have been fun to see this crash the game in one way or another. Very fun video, though. :D
This is 100% not a cult.
This is not a cult (but it sorta is)
I think the game may expect you to do this if you get multiple pages of relics.
What... Is...  This...  Game????  Spiff, why are you playing it?  ROFL!!!
12:36 You’ve betrayed yourself!    /s
1.1e4 means 1.1 times 10 to the power of 4 which is just 11000. It is called the scientific notation...
This is not a cult😅

How does Spiff find these crazy exploits?
I play this game daily. Now I know
No cult here, move on.
The Spiff said London and a YTer I follow can't even afford or find a place to live there
this is indeed a cult
I have no idea what I just watched. But I quite enjoyed it.  Thank you kind sir.
This is not a cult
Wow, yep spiff totally broke the game by… playing the game completely normally. Like, it was a strong run, but it was also just a standard run in this game. This is a game made to be able to be broken, so by this game’s standards that was just a pretty average endless run. Once he unlocks essences then he can make some truly broken runs.
Havin played this game since early in early access... Im here to let yall know the game used to be even more "perfectly balanced" back then xD Quite a lot of absurdly powerful combos then, tho ofc, no amount of dev time can fix all those exploitable combos heh
This might not be a cult
SPIFF CALLED ME A LAZY BARRSTARD hahaha
Thats 1.1eeeee? XD
This is not a cult, it's a club.

If you play the higher floors to get to essences your runs can go insane.

Day 251 of asking Spiff to play Battle Realms. Who knew that cult simulator was right between our noses.
today coffee drinkers won vs spiff.
Want to pay rent? Just sacrifice all your neighbors to multiple entities beyond our understanding of space and time.
Wow, thanks for teaching me that all you need to do to solve your financial problems is gamble a lot! I’m so glad to be part of this totally not cult
this is not a cult
so cookie clicker derivate?
I wonder if Spiff realized you can get a double eat on a symbol if you place it just right. Some of these cultists could have added value twice to the eldrich horror creatures and def would’ve been wild
This is not a cult!
This is not a cult. Its tax fraud.
So glad this isnt a cult. I have been drinking tea daily just like spiff says.
no cult we are friends
As a member of Spiff's family I wish to declare that this is not a cult. Yorkshire Tea Gold powers us and it is the mightiest tea. Praise be Spiff, that is all
This is in no way, shape, or form anything other than a wholesome family/friends cult.
I ensure you that I have not joined a cult to pay rent. Nor have I "introduced" anyone to an eldritch horror to anyone for the purpose of enhancing my potential yields. This is not a cult.
A 'Cultly Balanced' game, you say?
3:01 Spiff loves the British monarchs, Yorkshire tea and most importantly... Communism.
totally not a cult. :3
Awesome to see you playing this game.
This is ABSOLUTELY not a cult. Trust me, like I trust our lord and savior Spiff the Great 😃👍
This is NOT a cult
Wow! I did not expect spiff to play this game but I love it!
THIS IS not A CULT!

Maybe with all that new money you can afford to learn how to read scientific notation, rofl
This is not a Cult, I know this because our glorious leader the Spiffing Brit told us so. All hail the Spiffing Brit! All hail Yorkshire Gold!
This not a cult... wink wink nudge nudge
I am not in a cult and The Spiffing Brit is not a leader of a cult
As the german translator for this game, I am happy you didn't manage to actually break it and simply enjoyed it loads!  Thank you for showing more people this masterpiece!
Nah. Poor people numbers. You're not getting quadrillions per spin? You're poor.
Unironically the only way to pay rent anymore

This is not a cult. Nice video
THIS absolutely IS not A CULT!!

Please please, play the updated version
You should exploit bloxflips
The landlord is probably just spiff from another dimension where he is a real estate owner instead of a professional game exploiter.
Thanks to you, Spiff, I discovered a game I really enjoyed is now out of early access ! Finally !! As a French and proud british despiser im ashamed to say that I Thank you, but I do ! Absolutely love you videos by the way :] It's nice to have this "Totally not a cult" community and such :D
This is not a cult.
As all things should be: perfectly exploitable
This is not a cult.

This is not a cult, unless there are tax breaks involved
We are all individuals and absolutely not one collective mind.

This is cultn't
next time unlock essences and then do a cat build
Spiff, you gotta learn your powers of 10, 1e4=10000. So, 1.8 e4 = 18k
Ah yes, tax evasion spiff really wanna play with the tax man since he see it as a perfectly balance with no exploits...
Ohdear! The first time Spiff ever went for coffee! D:
I can't believe Spiff choose the coffee. I am literally shaking.
This is a cult!
This is most definitely a cult
Honestly, I expected better of you. This isn't even close to a broken build. Let alone up to your usual exploiting standards.  If you really want to break the game, you might want to see if you can replicate a bug I got when playing involving the popsicle, popsicle essence and possibly the capsule machine. I have absolutely no idea how I got it but somehow my game bugged to the point where I got a few hundred of the newest item or essence I picked up. Any experience players probably figured out immediately what essence I picked up after discovering that bug. Hundreds of black cat essences+a board full of cats=exponential growth. Sadly, I didn't find a way to make of logarithmic. Especially because I was several hours into an endless run.  Oh, one other thing I should mention. I got this bug before I unlocked essences. The essences I obtained were the result of the dishwasher and dishwasher essence. I also completely exhausted the rare item and very rare item pool by the time I got the bug meaning that items I already had were offered a second time. The first item I noticed the bug on was the capsule machine after I obtained more than 1 through normal means. That is why I'm not sure if the capsule machine is required for the bug to work.
This is not a cult. It is a religon and thus is tax deductable. Clearly, His Magesty's Government should deduct all related business expenses twice.
lolololololololololololololoiolololololol
Happy 2023 Spiffy bro. It's been a few since I have heard your spiffy voice.
Personal favorite with this game is the Amethyst/Dame build. Slightly better chance of getting the ingredients than the cultist build I find, and in a previous build I managed to make 1 billion in endless mode.
When's the episode on Dwarf Fortress coming?
Excuse me i am fallout and what is this?

Honey, SPIFF USED COFFEEEEEE IN A GAME
Now that was perfectly balanced video. Thank you Sir and now I shall go and enjoy more tea This is not a Cult, we are simply having a fantastic tea party

This is absolutely not a Cult, All Hail Spiffthulhu
"THATS 1.1 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!"
One of the few videos where I know of two builds more broken than this one. Look into the amethyst build or the fruit equivalent. I ended up with enough coins that the essence of the guilotine killed me. It was wonderful
and then the game forced spiff to pick get the guillotine essence
Positioning the goose no not consume the hexes would have been better then just removing hexes diretly to dip multiple times especially with the swapping gamepad.
Spiffs content seems to be dropping in standard precipitously. Shame as he used to be one of the best
ah yes, this is absolutely not a cult!
Good news, guys. We got tax exempt status.

In this video, spiff got exploited by coffee.
Spiff: "Which is kind of a bit more than the game intends you to make"  Me: "umm... this is a Broken Build Simulator genre game, it very much intends you to find the most broken combos"
He really should try a flower sun build.

8:29 really you take 4leaf I see you are new here XD
Its like real life...in a game.
Oh wow, you could actually keep playing and never lose with that build^^
This is nothing you can go way higher in this game.
This is not a cult
This not a cult .........;) all hail Lord Spiff
Thumbs up this message if you started drinking Yorkshire Tea because of Spiff
if you work with the amethysts, some arrows, some buff ladys you can make 29.000 and more in one spin
Which version is he playing? That seems like the old version. New version allows you to fight the landlord. Also there is a thing called essences that really break the game. He probably has not unlocked that yet.
puedo decir que viví para ver a Spiffing brit elegir una taza de café. metas de vida.  i can say i lived to see spiffing brit choose a cup of coffee. life goals.
Spiff! 1.1E3 is 1.1 multiplied by 10 to the power of three, so cubed, (10x10x10)x1.1 = 1100. Aka move the decimal point instead of having to count 👍
this is not a cult! well it has some cult elements, but still not a cult!..ok so it might be a little like a cult, but churches get tax exemptions, so we should 2?...ok so this is a lot like a cult, but also more like a church so not a cult at all! ....ok it's a cult..but hear me out..tea!

Got introduced to this game by DangerouslyFunny, its fun to see that both of you just went haywire with your money-making schemes.
This is not a cult
This is not a cult. In fact, it destroys cults! Look at how many cultists Spiff got rid of!
I got my Yorkshire Gold and am ready to watch another Perfectly Balanced game! Side note, my local grocer doesn’t have any regular Yorkshire tea. Any chance Spiff could fix that?
Spiff not understanding exponential notation is kinda hilarious.
Seems like sun-flower build is still more terrifying than this build.
This is "not" a cult

Coffee is love. Black, strong, no sugar, no milk.  And it kind of is a sort of tea :D I mean its brewed plant stuff....
I wish games would use engg notation for numbers. 19e3 is way more readable than 1.9e4, since we already think in groups of 1,000.

I broke this game months ago. It's not easy, but if you can get enough gems on the board and fill it with dames, you'll end up with infinite coins.
Are there any exploits to use to cover my rent
AYO. NOTIFICATION GANG

Some YouTubers have a theory that this game eases up on you if you play it live, because they can play this all they want and get only a small amount of video material but somehow the livestreams allow them to do crazy run after crazy run.
I'm so happy for spiff's cult... sorry I mean community of tenants who are living in perfect conditions that do... sorry I mean don't violate the Human Rights Act.
