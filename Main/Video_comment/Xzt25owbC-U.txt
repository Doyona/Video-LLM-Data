HES DONE ITTTTT
I hop this vid comes back trending as a little reminder for your wedding
They got engaged!
😂 Brother and sister
I totally agree, you can't ask a couple when they're getting married and expect them to have an answer for sure. These days it is scary though how many actually answer that question right away. I'm getting old
Like anyone gives a toss bro holy fuck 😂
7:40 turns out ethan was the first to have a kid and simon or vikk are both very close to marriage
:)
It's 2022, gender equality, Freya should be proposing to Josh.
When is he gon hit 5 mil subs 😭
its josh the goat
it jus weird to say when it happens it happens when you are the one to make it happens or not.Just marry her.what is the point of this girlfriend boyfriend thing
Why the fk you have that Thumbnail? you need her for views ffs, not even in the video+not deserved faime LOL
SO they don’t live together? But what about the profile
I just watched the wafflin’ podcast... and I’d rather watch your video 10 times than watch that shit ever again. Edit! No diss to you josh.. I’d rather watch your vid 100 times 😂
The sun can never not be aligned with Venus lol
How bout a sidemen couples test every couple does a test to see which couple is the best
Anyone find it strange that Zerkaa also run out or don't have new video ideas but the every idea a fan comes up with is somehow already on the list😂😂😂😂
People keep on saying Josh & Freya should get married or asking why they haven't gotten married. The reason is simple they love each other and don't feel they need to get married to show how much they love eachother. Maybe they want to get married when they have kids who knows.
Josh having a daughter would be the best thing ever. She be his little Princess.
Hello hello hello
The dislikers are the baby pigeons.
Sidemen Vs the sidechics
Kid gets murdered by nerf bullet with beautiful music has 13 million more views then this video
randy lol
Ugh I’m so pissed rn at all these josh haters he actually has amazing content he created the holiday vids on the sidemen which were some of the highest viewed vids on the sidemen channel like he deserves better 🥺
Yo sidemen vs sidegirls? When?
Randy is a gem 😂😂
Everyone we need to get josh to 10 million views go on his most popular video just tell this to everyone
any askers?
is this what you clicked for ? 7:55
Up the Gfinity🙏
Who else got the stupid fortnite ad
Randolph bruh. Lmao thats crossing the line imo
Only in the uk can u say to ur friends girl if she breaks up with him go for you
Great video. ☺️
Why does Josh always interrupt her. Was is just me or in the end she couldn’t talk?
What’s the song in the intro?
The sidemen should make a Minecraft SMP server where they invite other youtubers thay are friends with
The real reason Josh isn't married to Freya: the can't yet 😁
For anyone wondering, the sun, venus and mercury will next align in 69,163 AD
7:18
They have been together 3/4 of my lifespan
Love is a useless emotion.  Stay #single stay happy.  #Ahmedabad #singles join our #bachelors #club #group

Childish gang
Low key hope they don’t get married.  It’s fully overrated
#TeamPhil
"Sidelasses"
My man josh said he’s only farted twice in 10 years
I was 18 and she was 17 Everyone watching:😐😐
I feel like they’re both over thinkers just waiting for the other one to propose.
NGL the clothes left in bathroom corner i do that cant just be me and josh who do that

They are really cute togather and honestly i dont think they break up someday
Now that youre reading this there are some clothes left on "joshs corner"😂
Sidewomen
Yet does that mean u at going to get marry eventually
Its easy, he doesnt have the balls to just propose🤷🏻‍♂️
Lol why do some of the people asking the questions sound as if they're on to catch a predator?
I hate these videos. It’s just an add for app
Why the click bait tho
daddy chilllllll

I love josh sm
Josh gonna be a Silver Fox 🤣
🙏🏾👏🏾❤️
Everyone and their nan is getting a stereo sponsorship
lmao they could be called the side tings
Why does Freya have a black arm in the thumbnail lol
When they will get married is when they are ready and when they want to that’s the simplest way of putting it. I mean it’s just odd to ask that hmm
Wait Randolph has a wife...
Randy with a wife 😂
Your intro is clapped
They dating but they sleep in diff beds 😐 and they r 28 and 27
Stop with these stereo vids
Uhhhhh maybe because you didn’t propose idk just a guess😂😂😂
Josh is getting old
New freya channel? FreyaFartz
Randolph's a funny guy.
surely u guys make a girl group called the sidehoes
Why don’t they live together
josh is getting way more comfortbale on cam i love it
Anyone else notice he changed the thumbnail just now?????
Everyone go watch josh’s one legged football challenge video to get him his first 10 mill view video
Answer: They aren't ready for it yet.
Didn't he already stated time and time agian he just want to take the relationship slowly
Randy movin kinda mad there
The sideman’s clickbait has been on point recently
We love you Josh! You and Freya are absolute cuties 😩 I love you’re videos! Carry on making us smile 🥰
You two seem like a lovely couple. So nice to see💗
Is it because they probably had an open relationship at some point and it fucked things up
Sidemen: Make the Sidegirls Alvin and the chipmunks: Copyright Claimed for chipettes JJ: Am I a joke to you
How come the sidemen are interested in stero so much
No one: surely!
F
Cuz you are old?
wow where have I seen this type of video before lmao?
I've always wanted the boys girlfriends to make a YouTube channel called the side chick's 😂😂😂😂
Better get married soon, before Josh dies of old age
The maturity, man its so nniiicceee!!!
love it!
i love them bitch but in my opinion it sounds like they are still scared to commit to something for life
aye josh man, boost ya views and put a ring on it 👀
They’ll be a new channel next week: JOSH’s CORNER 😂😂
I've seen baby pigeons so its gud
I swear, if i see one more stereo video...
Freya is so beautiful.
Did i Ask?
Josh please skincare routine
Please have kids
Randolph is crazy LMAO
They would make a beautiful baby.......so cute
Randolphs Wife Is hot 😱🔥😍
Lmao I bin watching sideman religiously since vik played gta5 and Ethan had a life expectancy of 6 months and I’ve never watched ur channel before😂 ur a legend
Honestly who gets married these days? More break ups and complaining than anything else
I couldn't resist the clickbait!
you dont want to marry her cos she will runn away with half your money lol
when I started to watch this and heard zerkaa Thursday I was disappointed, but as the video went on it was actually okay
https://youtu.be/nvPGqb9V91Y
I know alot of people have entered but tomorrow it is my birthday and it would make my day if I won the giveaway
My parents started dating in 2000 and by the time they got to 10 years, they had been married 4 years and my sister was 8 and I was 4. But they only ended up lasting 16 years (from dating). Also they were engaged from 4 months
Wait, girls fart??!
Why r comments so unfunny now
the sun mercury and Venus don't align until 69,183 AD lmaO
The fact this isnt clickbait is unbelievable
is it just me or is this video banging views
Birds aren’t real
The real reason is Freya is too young
4:08 Josh “I’m looking at the ceiling”   Don’t worry josh we’ve all been there at 5am in the morning of our rockets
Why u gotta clickbait everything
They should make a sidechick 🤣💯💯
Still hoping Josh restarts the Homegrown podcast
Stereo is ruining YouTubers creativity 😭
King of clickbait
Just tell me that and I am done with this generation and youtube, you all care about his life and why he ain't married yet
Anyone else not a fan of the stereo vids?
One day when the sun aligns with venus and mercury, we will only care about their marriage while others are talking about the wonder but we might be dead, oh boy!
This was a cool video !!
The sun a-lines with Venus on the 5th of June this year. We know when they’re getting married!! :)
9:53 i'm dead
stereo could either get ksi or every other UK youtuber
My grandad use to have a pigeon shed and I seen 100s of baby pigeons
Josh looks like Pulisic when he had a beard
Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Jupiter, The Moon and The Sun were all in conjunction 11th of February 2021.... Soooo
The clothes in the corner i relate to
why is everyone doing stereo
My parents got engaged over 20 years ago and, moved houses and me and my little and then got married in 2019.
I actually do that
NAH ZERKAA I LIVE IN A FLAT AND THESE 2 BLOODY PIGEONS DECIDE TO LAY EGGS AND COLLECT STICKS ON MY BALCONY SO THE FIRST 2 HATCHED THEN THEY CAME BACK AND I THREW THE OTHER 2 EGGS OF THE BALCONY. R.I.P. EGGS/BIRD.
Stereo is not that good download clubhouse
Honestly if Josh and Freya break up I've lost hope in relationships🤷🏼‍♂️
I can't watch you and your clickbait anymore.Just make some normal videos...
Josh is still in free practice
7:58 is why you came here 🤭
Let’s see a double wedding with Simon that’s why they are waiting
They are not married yet because Freya is hung up on Lauren alexis
i feel like freya and josh are such a calm and fun couple like they are such a vibe ❤️
no one cares
The guys have 100% been told to say "Live on Stereo" as part of the #AD
YES JOSH I DO THE SAME WITH MY CLOTHS FOR MY MUM TO PICK UP LOL
Boiii I got 9 other siblings BAHAHA
Joshs vids popping off atm
Stereo do be the new raid shadow legends
Your bit moji thing looks like Bruno Fernandes
Am I the only one who wants to know where he got his matching skull rings from - are they from Stephen Einhorn?
:O
josh and freya talking about if they broke up made me feel so sad
I CANT FOLLOW U BRO IM 16 :(
in february 2021 venus and mercury will align
Josh is that old that he stills said paintings instead of pictures 😂😂😂
Randolph is the man😂😂
I reckon Freya should start a group with the girls and call it the sidechicks .
Simple answer the title they don't wanna
6:50 - 7:00 is just how people should see it
i love josh so muchhhhh
i feel sick when i see stereo now omfg
YouTube has started showing Pokémon ads on Josh's videos
I'm not gonna lie I have started watching big josher a lot more since seeing his video on freyas bday and I love these together. Their making me lonely🤣🤣
Mercury and Venus next time they will transit the sun at the same time is 69,163 :)
I hate that they are taking these stereo streams and making them main channel vids
love the childish hoodie
I adore Freya, what a gem <3
The real is for clickbait titles
You need to be 17+ for stereo and I put the wrong date in and I’m blocked😭
JOSH IS GETTING FUNNIER BRUH
I looked it up and as long as Josh wears odd socks in the year 69163 then they will get married
Cool 😎
" IDk why we keep getting asked this " Idk probably because you have been in a relationship for an eternity lol.............
I mean jj already had a kid 🤣
Stereo exists: Sidemen: it's free real estate 😂
what if you kick the pigeon and a baby comes out like those russian dolls
Is it because she sounds like a man?
shortest zerkaa video ever lol huge fan
Baby pigeons are real. One fell off my roof and died lol. Mummy pigeons just like to hide them.
Zerkaa
Josh saying “yet” just made it official
Like for the sidegirls.
Every man has a corner to put their clothes when having a shower and then leaving it there until some has said something
Now we can say it’s gonna be a reddit vid or a stereo vid
Collab with Josh(Slogoman) For old times sake.
Come on it's been 10years how dare you do that to her
THEY HAVE MATCHING SKULL RINGS
I’ve seen a baby pigeon. It was in a nest shitting like hell in my back garden for a week
Me and Frey both the annoying younger sister with an older brother called Josh😂😭
Side chicks make it happen
At this point since they are in rl for 10 years they should get married
Wait Randy has a gf? ☠️
How has a Q&A made a main Chanel video 🤦‍♂️
His accent just annoying u dont understand
No one watched u anymore fam ins
Ayo their vpgoing to get married at 10mill subs let’s get it
Trust me Josh, from someone who had their balcony invaded by pigeons, the babies are real.. and they're loud as HELL
AYYYYYYYYYYYYY I just uploaded a new video and I bet me and my friends are funnier than chunkz and filly. lmk
The only reason they are not married is because girlfriend does better in a title than wife
So Many people doing his shizzz
7:58 is what you came for
8th September, 2040 "Josh can we see your socks?"
Bro I swear, when Ferya said that I wouldn’t be doing what I do because of you Zerka, & then she said that goes for Talia & Gee, this reminded of when 21 Savage he said that “ a guy will help a girl if she need help easily & make her famous or rich or just to support her cuz we men genuinely do wanna help them but a girl will never do that for a guy” so basically what my whole point here is that it’s so sad for us men that we think these women love us for who we are but in reality they are with these famous boys/ guys just for their fame & money just to get fucking popular, name one girl that has helped a poor guy, or a lost guy bro non I swear to you this pisses me off a lot, then these same girls be talking about body positivity, gender equality & so on. I’m a get the fuck outtta here this doesn’t make any sense... brothers don’t get fooled take your time find the true & right one don’t let the one day or two day mask that they are wearing fool you.. I’m pissed man THIS ISN’T right!!  Smh 🤦‍♂️
josh when/if u propose or just for a sidemen vid do it on safari in South Africa in the Kruger National Park it's beautiful here and we could do with the publicity on like poaching etc
Why does the thumbnail look like a scene from Clerks?
Do you live together
Fr, does Josh's hair is that way due to the stress of organizing the sidemen vids?
I dont like the stereo thing in the middle  you need a 10sec add not 10min of ads it kinda feels like you are uploading just for ad money
How old is freya🤷
Decerto and Gamebattles with the 32 inch samsung tv and a capture card. Good times lol
Josh: "I got seasoned on the head" Me thinking of a beter line: "your relationship is spiced up"
Let’s say I didn’t just blast “HELLO HELLO HELLO” at 6:30 in the morning fml
I think that they will get married when they quit YouTube
ima be honest I'm meher falling for ur thumbnails again I have been on YouTube for too long to give em a few just cuz of their thumbnail in 2021
Did only I cringe when Randy said what he said who ever likes cringed
Nice
Stereo must be paying good for all these videos and promos
These stereo videos are dog tbh
Gotta wait till 2117 for them to get married😂
I heard that the sun is gonna align with mercury and venus tomorrow so josh better be wearing 2 different socks
Stereo sponsoring every single person in uk
"Ther reason why we are not married"  I mean its the perfect time Josh Its your chance, and tbh, your rich, so buy that diamond ring and propose my guy, good luck
Omfggggg, thought it was a Break up vid
ZerkaaWholesome ? u can give us wholesome overload to the dome
Just ignore those who wants you guys to get married they are single and so when they see other opposite sex hanging out they make them rush and saying please get together and then get married after they agreed with the fans which nobody should do that in the first place. Josh do what you guys want to do plus you guys are already like a married couple anyways as you guys are the longest couple in the sidemen group. so yha don't rush it because fans says so when they haven't gotten married or if they got asked they would say no i want to wait. All of this is all just time and never rush time or's you won't get anywhere that's why i'm not rushing either i'll let time and place and my heart know when its the right time to put out the ring or even ask someone out really.
anyone else wondering what type of bag the sidemen got from stereo for all these vids
I think she doesn’t want to get married
Cuz if u get married it can sometimes end s relationship. U can have a girlfriend from school to 90 np but if u get married there's problems that u need to sort out.
2:26 my little sister once trapped me in the shed and went crying to my mum that I locked her in the shed. While I was in the shed. If my parents didn’t look for me to tell me off she would’ve got away with it
Me: *Looks at thumbnail*  My brain: *please don't be a break up video*  Me: *reads title*  Thank God🙏
7:40 what josh said here about himself and jj here is so true you can see it in the moresidemen video where they played codenames. It just shows that they know each other very well.
I've seen baby pigeons, a pigeon had a nest in our window. And when the egg hatched the babies were so weird looking.
7:56 your welcome
"I want kids in my 30s" freya Josh realizing he is 2-3 years of being 30
Before watching predictions Freya: " If you see, we take things very slowly" Josh: " We have been together for  10 years, that is more than people's marriages"
Is it weird that i knew the answers to most of these?
Me sees an outrageous title Ofcourse its stereo.
Mad respect to Josh and Freya for 10 years because that is rare these days.
Married YET
their relationship makes me smile :)
Did anyone else cringe from Randolph's part
freya's cheek bones are outrageous
LMFAO Randolph is actually too jokes
All Of Zerkaa’s Pick Up Lines In Sidemen Tinder 1
Plot twist: Josh is saving himself for King Folabi
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A BREAK UP F UUUU 😅
Freya's cheekbones are literally perfect how can someone look like that!!!!
Josh’s hair looking nice still
Aww Freya didn’t keep the Lauren alexis sheets  😔
It's because you are celebrities, and celebrities don't marry, and when they do, the marriage lasts 5 minutes
At 10:20 Josh laughed like a old man
Been with my Wife for 17 years now, Keep it up Josh & Freya!
Josh. Pigeons grow up to almost full size in around a Month.
10:27 - Thanks for answering my question both of you 😊
Why is the thumbnail black and white?
Sidemen vs girls roast pleaseeeeeeee
Anyone else sick of stereo? Fuck me
JJ while watching this: rahh Randolph is moving mad
Where did you get that hoodie Josh?? I need it!!
All fake
Out of all the sidemen I'd say I actually watch Josh the most, then JJ.
7:57 it is
Duracell - Jontha links in the background in the start
Wait is my maths off or did big clever Josher re-sit a year of college/6th form and that's how him n Freya were in the same year?
disliking the next stereo video i see
Josh better be wearing different socks on different socks on December 21st this year because that’s the next time Venus and Mercury line up according to this site https://www.bustle.com/life/astrology-2021-aquarius-stellium-mercury-retrogrades if I understood properly and am not a full on idiot.
This was a stinker
if we're dating in 10 years we're not dating
That’s bogus josh
You and Freya have been together forever Simon only recently got a gf jj same behzinga was with someone ages ago can't remember her name vikk got a gf recently not sure about tobi or Harry coz they are more private but you and Freya have been together for years im surprised you guys don't have kids
Imagine while answering "when are you going to marry her" and he says all that and go to freya and proposes her
Freya’s a real g tho fr
I love the "Hello, hello, hello" at the beginning of every video.
Josh you’re a sliver fox mate
https://youtu.be/SHTf1-FvKB0
king king king 👑 🐐
My mom also proposed to my dad.
7:57 for the title
Randolph is such a strange don... such an awkward question
cringey thumbnail
I am seeing a pattern in every sideman personal channel Latest videos
awww, Take the picture your not famous.
zerkaa Thursday on my birthday. great video💯
Am i tripping or does josh have a lazy eye?
Randy😭😭
Can we stop these "Stereo" vids. I knew this is what it'd be when I saw the title. I clicked because it's the Josher but damn I hate these videos.
This one ain't it tbh
Does anyone notice how cool his beard is
Bruvv
No one The Sidemen: Talking about their relationships Me after being dumped by my GG: pass me the bleach
This stereo video was nice considering that all the other ones I watch it’s juts people taking the piss 😂
Doesn’t wanna give away all that money in a divorce
They need to do a tinder vid with the sidemens gfs and when Freya comes on Josh needs to go last and move the tinder board and propose to her that’s would be a banging way to propose
7:56
the video when you propose to freya will be a banging video
7:56 is what your here for
They are just so cute.
Try sleeping in the same bed before getting married😂
I really hope they get married within 5 years, josh that will be the moment all the boys cry
Isn’t it crazy that they have been together as long as the Friday song has been out
Everyone searching for baby pigeons...
I’m sorry but this should be a sponsee Sunday/Saturday I don’t think this is good enough to be a zerkaa thursday
i love randy too much lol
Sidemen tinder but there girlfriend are watching from another room
7:59 ur welcome
Haven’t watched it yet, let me guess it’s a stereo
I’ve raised 3 baby pigeons in the space of 1 year once. It was so weird all three of them fell from the nest 2 months apart and we had to feed them and raise them up then they flew asay
Is Freya more into girls? Than boys she always be talking about girls like that
Matthew 3:2
Repent Jesus Christ is coming soon
Can you fix the glitch on your camera that makes the video jumping.. it’s a tad annoying lol. Great video nonetheless!
What's the background music? It's so nice.
Stereo the next raid shadow legands
Randy is goated
Make girl group called " the side chicks"
Family Feud but the girls vs the boys
so tired of the stereo videos theyre everywhere. basically just a podcast with a moving emoji
Freya looks like she had drugs and Alcohol and is sad in the thumbnail
Not gunna lie I do have a mega crush on freya, fuck it and josh both my favourites out the sidemen and girls,
Josh the sun aligns with Venus and Mercury in May 😏😏😏
I ain't gonna watch the whole video. Someone let me know the reason why they're not married or if it's just clickbait  👇
Its friday
I fucking love this couple they are goals
1:38, did you hear the way he said that? smh he's clearly pissed off at her
Shave your beard
Is it just me and josh or do other people not leave their clothes in the bathroom??
every single youtuber i watch is doing stereo videos. the money must be good
Couple goals! Love these guys 💛
sideman vs sidehoes
Coz u got cancer from callux
I thought the answer to why you weren’t married was gonna be she hadn’t settled yet
7:57 here you go guys
Thumbnail and title couldn't be more of a shit house clickbait if it tried
Best couple on YouTube
Woahhhhhh copying Simon original 😂
To answer the video it's because he hasn't got his fingers stinky yet
Cbf with this stero shit
Bruv wtf my head
So josh won’t propose until the year 69163 and that’s only if he’s wearing two different socks 😒
This video made me google baby pidgeons. Hes not wrong, ive never seen a baby pidgeon either. Maybe they are spy chickens xD  If you know you know PSJ
you can be her dad, you old man!
Yo no lie, when Josh said his favourite conspiracy theory was pigeons arent real, I was smiling up until he said "how many baby pigeons have you seen".... Broooooooo
Unsubt from all channels what a shit
If josh said he was 39, I’d believe that.
Mercury won’t turn into a crescent again until late Jan and Venus until nov of this year soo... josh clocks ticking atleast it’s a good video
Sidemen VS Sidewomen
I like how he said "yet" 😏
Zerkaa to the moon!
The neat noodle additionly arrest because rock finallly increase unlike a present bush. damaged, spicy feedback
Wish Stereo would fuck off
Josh. Hit up David Dobrick if it all ends. He’s looking for a chick and you are the spitting image
someones copying your shorts channel
Josh is so underrated
But I still love gorgeous josh
Stereo for a zerkaa Thursday ehhhh no for me
8:25 someone in astronomy  is going to study this and until this event occurs
For a 64 year old man you got nice skin.
Wait is Freya bi?
Boys I’m uploading my first rocket league montage tomorrow, so if you want you can sub :)
I personally don’t believe in marriage, if you love someone enough you don’t need a paper of paper to prove it.
I’m on 1 subscriber now let’s see how many I get after this comment
Am I the only one really tired of all these stereo videos. They must be getting hella bread to change up and ruin their content for this one app.
Before I watch the reason better be because we don’t fucking want to yet.
If these two broke up,it would be the end of the world as we know it...we all hope that day will never come.
im fully shook. Ive never seen a baby pigeon. this man is onto something
That was one dark thumbnail
Between this and Harry its a great day for Sidemen clickbait
Bro u gotta marry her quick ur nearly at ur retirement home
You're already Dad for the Sidemen lol it's not that bad bro, do it
yous should bring out a sidegirl group !!!
How much is stereo paying the sidemen even Harry coming out of the depths and doing one
josh is so underrated
The clothes in the corner of the bathroom is definitely a guy thing, I’m exactly the same 😂🤷🏻‍♂️
Idea for sidemen Sunday:   Tinder: ex girlfriend edition  Or just anything along those lines
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxAtXuHCWPO-R0N25qCKCQQ/featured
6:15 ONE OF US! ONE OF US lol i knew gee watches techno but i was very surprised
Freya can propose to josh during February on a leap year

Big up freya🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
Josh: Zerkaa  Thursday Tobi: Tobi Tuesadays Simon: Miniminter monthly Harry:  loading

Anyone deepin josh called salt and pepper seasoning 😭😭😭😭😭
Josh: when the sun alines with Venus and Mercury  Me: checks every astronomical Callander on excistance
I saw a baby Pigeon Shanked up on my bike gears
Good click bait 😂
Well thats gonna get views
8:25 I thought we learnt this lesson last year? Literally anything could happen 😂
My g zerkaa konws camras in the birds
The sidemen have gotten better with the wording of their title
What happened to all your big ideas for zerkaa thursdays?? This feels more like a monday video vibe
I think that people ask Josh and Freya about marriage ,just because it's rare for a couple to go such a long time and only being boyfriend and girlfriend .
I knew it was a Stereo video the moment I read the title
Ngl all the stereo videos are getting old but FairPlay getting the bag
What is that thumbnail
Wait haven’t they broken up
8:00 title?
Hi
done. It is not so serious but I looked at Zerkaa's dms: feliui.crabdance.com poor girlfriend, I hope it changes
Why does everyone always have low power mode on while its charging TURN IT OFF😡
Dont get married 😂😂 its a trap
You,you just have been Joshbaited
The SIdemen vs Sidewoman / some type of game show
Randy is a trooper😂
To me I really hate These stereo thing when they talk about about COVID it just reminds me how bad life is rn
Jesus this thumbnail looks like someone died 😂
10:30 is freya farting here ?
Song is Duracell instrumental
No one:      Literally no one:          UK Youtubers: —LIVE ON STEREO!
I'd like to think they'd be called the SideChicks
You have to be 18 to go on it 😭
This is so cute and wholesome
No one:  Everyone:
10 years and no kids? Damn joshs pull out game is hella strong
🚀🚀
Randolph is the G.O.A.T
7:57= title answer
Man this stereo is such a bs, i cant be only one that doesnt like it
Stereo is the British raid shadow legends
Getting married is an old tradition there is really no point in it anymore unless you’re married
Josh ur gf cheats on u ik
What’s with all this clickbait? 😭😭
stereo really did just buy out the sidemen lmao... not complaining tho get that bag
Knew josh was always smart but his perception of things is so interesting
Is it just me or does Josh’s video lag a lot.
Whys her arm black in the thumbnail
She pretty 🤷🏻‍♂️
I liked and paused the video to mention, how happy Freya looked when josh said about the skull rings 6:00
The woman can ask a man anytime facts
i watched this live and i will watch this again
7:55   Thank me later👍
idc if it’s a joke randy needs to respect his boy why would u ask his girl if she would get with him
Plot twist: they are already married but haven’t told anyone
Subscribed :) Also Freya is honestly one of the prettiest people I have ever seen
Dude, 12 years I proposed last year and were getting married next year. Do things in your own time, not to everyone's expectations or "the norm".
As a guy, it's nice to see another guy openly talk about their anxieties and thought processes! Thanks 👏
Freya’s got such a nice voice it’s unbelievable
Lmao last Zerkaa Thursday I made a comment that was one of the top comments about the reason Josh isn’t married to Freya. I saw the title and thought it was my time to shine... only to realise... it wasn’t.
What are u looking at in the thumbnail
Damn my parents have been together for 20 years we are 6 kids and they aren’t even married
great video dodge coin, can't wait till next dodge coin thursdays
the most BEAUTIFUL couple around.
Don't worry, the title said *yet*
Yoyoyooyoyo
Any UK YouTuber : exists  Stereo: Hi do you want a brand deal  Love the content by the way  Get the bread
Idk about that one Randolph tbh
so the sun aligns with mercury and venus on 69163. So when do i get my invite for the wedding?
When they get married or Josh asks the question that’s gonna be their best memory.
Nice work #Mhlabagang
You guys should get a hamper for Josh’s corner😂
Thai stereo thing better not be a trend for long it’s terrible video content
SIDEMEN WEDDING VIDEO AND PEWDIEPIE WEDDING VIDEO WLL GET THE MOST LIKS FOR THE WEDDING VIDEO
i can imagine freya as a mum who always knows whats going on and her kids cant get anything past her and then josh would just be the chill dad who wouldnt want to tell them off
I'm watching at 1.27am in Qatar 😅
how much money this stereo app got jheez
Som1 tell me when the title comes
That hello hello hello is the best part of my day
Honestly, married possibly but kids it’s too early
Sidemen vs Sidewomen
you came for 7:50
this is why the sidemen are the best because they are all geniune and they all have each others back if freya and the girls were in a sidemen sunday i think the lads would lose the channel because we all secretly know that the girls are the ones provided the guys with the material lol oj.
I fucking hate steep
Was halfway through the video when I noticed that they’re not in the same room and are on an airpod call...
666th comment
name of the beat or song @ 9:17
Freya is cappin.. she wants to get married asap
ayo peep the childish hoodie 🔥🔥🔥🔥 sheeeeeeeeeeeesh!
So there getting married on September 8th 2040
7:57 thank me later
Thing I love about Josh is he’s never embarrassed to show love to Freya like bigs her up in videos, is always hyping her on her streams. Just a mature donny who doesn’t care about any kids that might call him a simp just for being nice to his gal
Is it just me or is josh underrated he gives such good content
lol, saw the thumbnail and title. clicked on the vid and was greeted by  HELLO HELLO HELLO 😂😂
Mint vid
Plot twists they’ve been married for 5 years
First harry with mo actual girlfriend and now josh with a girlfriend
That hoodie is so dope
This sterio app is really annoying
6:27 Josh: I was 18 Freya: I was 17 👀👀👀👀👀
Last time I was this early Simon wasnt virgin
With the marriage thing. I didn't ask my now fiancé to marry me until 5 years into the relationship. That was the right time for me and for us so Josh/Freya... You guys do you! 👍
Not a fan of this stereo don’t know why ahaha
Josh does stereo with his girlfriend, Simon does stereo with his girlfriend   Vik does stereo with Harry😂😂😂😂
Sidemen vs sidegirls family feud
randys kinda mad you know
This probably sounds like a daft question but has that massive giraffe always been there? 🤣
Stinker
Where can i find freya's hoodie?
Stereo: how many sponsorships do you want?                       Every UK Youtuber: YES.
Trim is 🔥🔥
WHEN FREYA SAID "ONE OF US" I GOT A NOSTALGIC MEMORY OF VANOSS AND HIS CREW
Girlfriend does better in a title than wife
done. It is not so serious but I looked at Zerkaa's dms: feliui.crabdance.com poor girlfriend, I hope it changes
my grandad keeps pigeons...
just let it sink in that one day we're gonna be just vibing then suddenly freya tweets "💍" and all chaos breaks loose
Josh do more stereo videos!!!
Sidemen Sunday - Josh and Freya get married.
Loving the content josh keep up the amazing work lad
Nice
Hmm.. let’s see how many subs I can get off this comment. Currently at 78. ( BTW not a bot just an experiment)
Josh: ‘JJ makes a decision and then later finds out if it was a good decision or not’ Jj: * has a kid * * leaves*
why was Josh's stereo name Josh Zerker. Not Zerkaa
Hmm.. let’s see how many subs I can get off this comment. Currently at 78. ( BTW not a bot just an experiment)
Moment you've been waiting for 8:00
Childish hoodie again, new one this time. Gotta love the sidemen's childish collection.
11:26 lol he sounded like kratos
The real reason Josh isn’t married yet cause of the quality clickbait
This has to be one of the bad zrk Thursday
She needs to trim her bangs love the dark hair though
Hmm.. let’s see how many subs I can get off this comment. Currently at 78
how many subs can i get from this comment currently at 0
Who else searched up baby pigeons as soon as he said that ——>
done. It is not so serious but I looked at Zerkaa's dms: feliui.crabdance.com poor girlfriend, I hope it changes
Im a chicken
These stereo q+a videos do be clickbaiting us hard 😪
These stereo q+a videos do be clickbaiting us hard 😪
made it to the video boys
Fun fact my best friend was the first questioner
7:56 For people who wanna get straight to the point
You’re very cute and I’m happy you’ve got each other. Just enjoy yourselves and keep on growing together. Cheers! :)
why no one talking about when she said one of us that's a techno chat thing
Simon need to get ready
The first time I have watched a zerka Thursday less than an hour it was posted
My mum and dad got married after being together for 19 years
Oh mate we all know what happened in Mykonos 😉😂
The reason is because Josh hasn’t fucking proposed.
Instead of sidegirls name the channel sidehoes or sidechicks
When your wearing the same hoodie as josh 😍
8:24  Everyone write that down write that down
That editing on Freya’s Randolph reply 🤣🤣🤣
bruh notice how as soon as he said 'it happens when it happens' they lost about 100 listeners lmao
Wtf is up with this stereo trend, plz don't make it a thing bcz i actually don't care, it's a lazy video to make
I love them as a couple so much
Illuminate
stereo as a zerkaa thursday, what a scam!
This video is so beautiful I’m happy for the both  of them you can tell they really love each other and they would be together forever
Wait a minute, when did you guys start dating?  "I was 17 and i was 18" 0_o
I love you both. Love from Pakistan
as much as stereo ads are annoying asfffff at least we get some great content :D
Fuck i thought its a reddit vid
69 dislikes.  Nice.
Iv seen a crackhead kill a pigeon they are real😂
cba with these stereo videos now, It's the same questions for every person
Finally I've been waiting for this video for years
pigeons are in ALMOST every major city in the world so the camera conspiracy could very well be done by that family that run the world to keep a track on the rest of us
The moment we have all been waiting for
Salt and pepper 😭😂
Do they sleep in different beds
The thing that I like about their relationship is that they can make jokes without the other getting mad .
Id hate to see Steroes outgoings this month
The Title: 7:55. Your welcome.       (Run me my likes)
Josh has the same birthday as me
I watched this at 30 mints
09:22 I DO THIS TOO
He says you will get abuse for messing up on a sidemen sunday That one women from the tinder 😂
Josh moving mad with these titles lately
Man called salt and pepper seasoning.🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣
*When venus and the sun align and Josh is wearing two different socks.* Niko omilana: i snuck into Josh's wedding disguised as bist mayne
I saw the thumbnail and thought u guys broke up, don’t scare me like that😂😂
4:50 WTF WAS RANDOLPHS RANDOM MONET
Just get married when you want. I hate that it is a societal expectation that if you've been with someone for x amount of time you must get married
The video honestly nobody gives a fuck about
9:34 Josh singing here with me by Dido takes me back lmao 😂
okay but can we just look at the fact that he’s wearing a childish hoodie
My brain after the video ends : Sidemen Sunday “ Josh and Freya are married” 🥺💍
Joshes Trim doh
What is it with stereo videos having the most clickbait thumbnail and title?
If u see this comment you need to leave a like👍👍
i called it in cals video and said stereo is gonna do bit's
done. It is not so serious but I looked at Zerkaa's dms: feliui.crabdance.com poor girlfriend, I hope it changes
so the sun, mercury & venus align approximately 2.5 times per year (unless you meant from the perspective of earth) so if you'll just let me know how often you wear odd socks, we can do some quick calculations and figure out when we should expect you to announce the engagement
Man, this Channel is just a non-stop advertisement
Rahhh
Josh even clickbaits his stereo shows
I honestly don't want Simon having kids, Simon would have to take care of his kids and stop doing videos sometimes and Talia wouldn't even care a shit!
You can’t just have 1 child, every kid needs a sibling 😅
Freya got one of the most beautiful last names I’ve ever heard
Don’t diss a pigeon, otherwise pigeon disses you JOSH!
How many videos does he have with this title?
i honestly thought josh was using the title and thumbnail as clickbait
In an alternate universe: I proposed to Freya.
Willy
Josh is underrated
Josh is so underrated what a legend
i think it says a lot about the strength of their relationship. the whole time its been online and out for everyone to see and they've managed to get through everything and (presumably) are still happy
If Josh as two different socks in a video we will know what happened 🥺
Baby Pigeons are the same size as the adults
😂 Who else googled baby pigeon as soon as Josh said that?😂
Do you really need marriage though?
who else thinks the girls should be called sidechicks
The real reason is because wife doesnt do as well as girlfriend in the title
7:55 for title ur welcome ☺️
Josh: I was 18 Freya: I was 17  *FBI has entered the chat*
Oooo
Don't kill me, but I believe saying "We'll never get married" in front of your significant other is very disrespectful and selfish. So what then? You're just wasting each other's time until you find a proper candidate?
Josh is a Goat no matter what the people say, he's a Goat.
me and josh same hoodie lets go
Josh: Zerkaa Thursday Tobi: Tobi Tuesadays Simon: Miniminter monthly Harry: loading
Why is it whenever people go on stereo, they all use airpods
are stereo trying to take over the world???
Me: Wait a minute this isn’t a Monday I can’t be clickbaited twice a week
I hate stereo videos
Am I the only one that gets hella annoyed with all those Stereo vids?
I just googled when will the sun align with venus and mercury and it said june 3rd 2020 so you are 7 months late , Im just saying
Not knocking the other sidemen guys but atm Josh has to be my favourite YouTuber. Keep winning brother 🙌🏼💯
Why is everyone doing Stereo rn????
Get married we want a sidemen stag do!!
Sidewomen vs Sidemen would be jokes fam pleaseeeee Josh
No one:  The sidemen talking about there relationships knowing we are all lonely
Anyone else hear the pain in Josh's voice when he was talking about being a over thinker and that he has trust issues 😢
I've been waiting for this video lol
9:53 way too true my fiance rips out some shecky farts that alway have me laughing bc it's just so load and windy lmao
I'm gonna take a wild guess that the answer is the EXACT same reason it's been for like 5 YEARS, so strange people still ask
me looking at the thumbnail and not the title and thinking they were breaking up and almost died
josh mate propose already
Earliest I’ve been to a zerkaa video
This is a brilliant video josh Thanks for your consistency we  really appreciate Love you josh and thanks
Well then Josh isn't getting married until 69163 AD...
Marriage is for simps
Freya’s pet peeve about Josh: You leave your clothes everywhere Josh’s pet peeve about Freya: *F* *A* *R* *T*

No u guys should hv a child around the same time as Talia and Simon for them to grow up together
W
I’ll save you all some time 7:56 is when someone asks him when he gets married
Lmao Randy is a goat
You know it's about to be a stereo video when you see a clickbait thumbnail
9mins late
Stairio
Lads
I love how honest they were even with these deep questions

Hi Josh 😅
fire
jj is the only one left
No one cares
Who else googled baby pigeon as soon as Josh said that?😂
damn that sucks watched the whole video tho
who else was watching this live
The reason they aren't married is because Freya can't stop thinking of Randy.
How many hellos lol

does anyone else feel like they watched the sideman for so long that you know them
Hiii
