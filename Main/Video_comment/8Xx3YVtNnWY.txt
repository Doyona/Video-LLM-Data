Devo dare credito a questo canale della velocità con cui vengono pubblicati questi punti salienti. Ben fatto.
Vlahovic in this game he s performance that so amazing  he s hero for juventus in this game
Y Pogba???
Tammy abraham support
ez?
allgeri dosent know how to use vlahovic hes completey isolated most of the time
poor call from the ref. only a little phyiscal.
That freekick from Vlahovic🤯🤯🤯🤯
Maldita Juventus se la tienen merecido por hacer sufrir a Dybala 😥😡
Roma 👏
Var is terrible, no one even notices the handball, they should do var like appeals in tennis, you get 3 per team and var should only come in for clear and obvious errors like being way offside
kerenn ..juventini indonesia
#AllegriOut
I just hope people dont start pressuring mourinho and roma to win the league this season , give it time and you will see the roma you were used to see with players who lived roma and gave everithing for roma like totti
I still don't understand why whould Roma fans chant "gypsie" to Vlahovic when they have Matic and Svilar on there team,plus there name is "AC Roma"....
Vlahovic is the next Zlatan!
14 Shomurodov
Abraham celebrates the goal and Dybala choose to take the ball and bring it to the kick-off spot for Juve. Man still has feeling for Juve.
Roma should buy ozil
@officialasroma  ZALEWSKI 🔥🔥🔥
Benzema replacement the Serbian in years to come
I do not see an intencional hand ball, Mourinho knows how to bribe referees.
Mourinhio doing what he does best. Check out the banter 🤣  https://youtu.be/RMqS1rdPHMs
Oh wow this camera quality
1:24 What a goal! Sad that it was chopped off
Classic Jose
I find the foul call on Juve's disallowed 2-0 very harsh, with the fact that Pelegrinni's challenge is destabilizing Vlahovic, who does not seem to be hitting the ball intentionnaly. Wouldn't have shocked if it was allowed to stand.
Pecatttt allergi
Luckily I done both pogba and wijnaldum
What a free kick goal by Vlahovic🔥🔥
https://youtube.com/channel/UCb7j9qgrOObvij7MXDkDzQw
Tammy 💙💙💙
Супер
Cuadrado for sale
Como é bom ter VAR ein, se não fosse ele a Rubentus tinha vencido no garfo como antigamente sempre frz
Рома всегда будет бить слабые команды, с сильными всегда проигрывать...
За ничью , пиццей не угощают...
This guy is the best English commentator
Unfortunately Grande Seniora, we dont winners. Victory only with Spetsia ,Thursday.
why Allegri loving McKennie so much
Horrible Fowards of 🇷🇸 : Vlahovic & Mitrovic!!
Scezny OUT !
vlahovic still can score with that kind of play since he join deserve respect.
COMMENTARY SERIE A 👍
10 out of the last 20 games in Serie A have ended in draw.. 50%.. 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
Dybala still need time, abraham nee more active to get the ball. I hope the arriving of Belloti could make Roma stronger. Forza Roma
mestinya Juventus menang. lucu membatalkan gol demi pelanggaran.
Abraham is in Englands world cup squad or should be...any player that can score goals and consistently play well in seriaA is a banker in my opinion
Please, always give a preview about the line up
Cuadrado egois
Allegri OUT!!
Great one Roma
Roma is a puffed up team coached by a puffer fish.
Vlahovic is better than Halaand and Mbappe
Cette Roma là m'inquiète si elle compte prendre le scudetto qu'elle soigne un peu son jeu offensif. Avec des attaquants qui sont transparents tout au long du match !!! En tout cas le jeu offensif est très mauvais !!!
What a game
Aqui no Brasil si fosse pro Flamengo esse gol seria Válido porque será né 💸💸💰
Bremer and Alex sandro error?
Yes
R.i.p my pogba doesnt g’ets upgraded to 98😥
Tammy and dybala, signs of things to come
ROMA=AMOR
I congratulate Roma, they managed to get to 4th place. And also condolences to Juventus. They only rank 7! Let's try to get to 1st place, Juve!
Yes
_Фигня, я лучше снимаю_
Stop adding adds
Glad to see Tammy scoring. - Chelsea fan
AsRoma 🇧🇷👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
1-1 vs Juve, adl Hasil yg sangat Bagus
sprtinya wahyu scuddetto jatuh ke asroma ..........
Roma is new candidate for SERIA A. 💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
come on mourinho shock the world by winning serie a !
LOL!  This was how Inter played when Mou was their coach. Not pretty, not flashy and always make you wonder how his team gonna win the match, not to think of the trophies. But Inter went on to beat Barca at Camp Nou and then Bayern at the finals to win the Treble.
why gives vlahovic ball. not left minute 0:56 and minute 1:10 also to. left vlahivic gives right????
วลา​โฮ​วิ​ช​เกมส์​เยือนไม่ยิงเลย

Vlahovic is a beast
The goal was 100% Alex Sandro’s fault terrible defender
болею за Рому,потому что теперь тренер этого клуба Жозе 👍👍⚽️👏👏👏👏🌏🕊🇰🇿
Srbija brate 🔥
T.Abraham is becoming a big time player. He's scored so many important goals for Roma
our defense is not what it use to be, no chiellini  at the back anymore is a huge loss.
play bove, zalewski as the starter EZ top 4
No hand ball
can anyone name a match in this tour duller than this one?
I wonder how many people recognize the details of Cuadrado's game, and that he learned them from studying Matic at Chelsea.
No handball, again with this referee
Eagle eye..  Referee kontroversi  Locatteli goolllll score 2-1 Not a violation
원엑스뱃 쓸까
i hate those players who destroyed others Goal
i hope mou or Milan win serie a , but milan are pretty strong , juve issue is allegri , get rid of him
why can not juve get rid of allegri , get zidane or luis enrique ,
Nice dybala
Var not fair
jventus
Alegri out,,,zidan in..
Great ...
Serie a is starting to challenge the Premier League. Only the money and stadiums are missing but with if this keeps up it won't be long top players would want to play in the league.
Arkadiuszo
Santuy giallarosi meskipun hanya 1 poin tetap berarti juve tetaplah juve
Roma is a poor team just like before.
when the commentator says "Dybala", I immediately looking for the white shirt Juventus team... forgetting that now he plays for Roma
Oh, Vlahovic goal🔝🔝
Juve should get rid of their coach. Man has one of the best no.9 but he is isolated. Score one goal and then defend , defend and defend. Overrated manager.
Cant wait for Paul Poopa. Juve will finish last if he ever plays for them. Injured? hahaha. He will be playing Sunday morning.
Wow, my favorite striker score beautifull free kick world class
Valvovic freekick was stunning 😍
The hand ball was real??
VAR merusak keindahan sepakbola
Maybe better do not show results in title.
Глупо отменили гол шикарный гол.Нужно было засчитывать
well done Serie A for uploading at 50fps
DV9🔥🔥🔥🔥
Why was the second goal of Juventus not counted ???!...the referee,s outrageous hypocrisy
Czensnej
Allegri out
-Scessny remains glued to his line as if he thinks he is protecting his country from a military invasion, this is embarrassing. So long as he's in goal Juve will continue to concede goals for no other reasons than a keeper who refuses to move off his line. -The one time when Juventus manage to score a well-constructed goal it's disallowed for a handball... which only happened because Cristante was jostling with Vlahovic and making the latter lose his balance.
Come on roma
Kiper asr kurang bagus
Forza Roma
That Dybala assist
Man I watched the game because of Vlahović, it was one of the most boring games I've watched in some time, i dont know if that game tempo is normal in Italy, if the answer is yes thats pretty bad..
Roma is big team now.
A better, positive Coach would have won this game. #AllegriOut
This guy Cuadrado is so selfish. Not a team player at all
Thanks for the referee whos not give roma penalty
Gweh wibu 🗿☝🏻
Why 2 goal for juve is not goal ?
beautiful free kick
Abraham doesn't have respect to Paulo. His goal is owing to Paulo's assist. He is selfish.
Roma needs strong holding midfield, defence is okay, even that Juve goal was scored from an error in the 1st minutes
Outttt alergiiiiii
Gooooo juveeeee
That Locatelli goal should have stood. If there was a handball it was unintentional when there bodies clashed. It could've been just advantage to Vlahovic there.
#allegriout

#allegriout
Alegri is destroying Juventus , they play slow boring football . Midfield has no dynamic players . They need to sack Alegri , they are wasting Vlahovic by not playing to his strengths ..
Супер команды😎😍🤩😃😄
Special One will be changed ROMA s  history. It's will take sometime. Actually, i believe in Mourinho who is a special one.
Zidane in
Why were Pogba, Di Maria and Wijnaldum not playing?
Me gusta que los videos sean subidos con la opción 1080p50 👌🏼
dybala ❤️❤️❤️
Vlahovic is a pure talent
yevantus is finished
How is that vlahovic handball???
The best coach in serie a allegri
00:59 Quadrado should have been direct shoot! Man!!!
Kenapa ketika gol locatelli membahas var sangat begitu lama,, ketika selebrasi sudah selesai...  Dan hansball smalling di kotak pinalty sangat tidak di hiraukan wasit apalagi melihat var... Sungguh tidak adil...
Milik Juve!
Great point for Roma. These teams are fighting for Serie A title and ECL spot.
❤️💛🐺🇮🇹🇮🇩🤗💪🤲🏆
VAR in Serie A much better than EPL
Bro the first 18 seconds in the video juv scored already.🔥🤩
SPECTATORS NEED TO IMPOVE SO MANY EMPTY SEATED TO SEEN..IN EPL IT FULL OF STADIUM SPECTATOR FANS IN MATCHDAY THAT SHOW SERIA A IS NOT PAYING LESS ATTENTION FROM FOOTBALL LOVERS AMONGT OTHERS COUNTRY.. EPL IS FOOTBALL PARADISE
Dybala class
Chelsea could have kept Tammy but instead they wasted money on Werner and Lukaku
Матч выдался интересный. Но походу Ювентус забил , то два мяча!
Roma will play Champions League next season
ROMA❤
Roma can win serie A title this season...
Mourinho the special one doing great things in Roma
Smalling's handball?? No var checked?? Ckckck
JUVENTUS NEED TO CHANGE THERE COACH IN HIS PAST TIME HOW FAR HE CAN MAKE JUVENTUS  IN EUROPEAN COMPETITION UCL THERE IS NOT CHANGES IN HIS STYLES OF FORMATION.AND DID NOT HAVE BRAVE MENTALITY
Whatttt aa assist dybbbaalaaaaaa
I giocatori della Roma giocano male, tutta la squadra non ha tattiche, il centrocampo non è in serie, l'attaccante n. 9 è molto povero e la sua figura è come una tavola di legno, che deve essere sostituita!  Roma è giù
We really need a better coach than allegri. His style is kinda outdated
Perdemos 2 pontos ⚽⚽ para essa bosta de Roma
#Alegriout #comebackconte
Juve need to fire the whole fitness coaching and medical team. The players cannot run for 90 minutes. It's always like this since last season. Juve played well and scored in the first 30 minutes, and then slowing down and conceded later in the game. The players have awful stamina, often lose in physical contact, and easily injured. No other team have a long injury list early in this season like Juve.
Perin should be number 1 GK
Roma will be chasing for e title just like Juventus and both Milan....no like e past just chaing for 6-7th positions...chasing for Europa place...
Big shout out to serie A for giving us Free high quality highlights
Succes dybala
Well done to Roma, great start to e season!!! 2 win n 1 draw in e first 3 games!!! Awesome Jose Mourinho 👏 🙌 👍!!!
Juventus has the worst goalkeaper in the history of the club.
Allegri ball🫡
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎Рома Абрахам и Дибала Шаравий 🤣👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
If this was EPL the goal stands particularly if it is United 🤣🤣🤣
Dusan Vlahović don't the ball with the hand😠.
Juventus really have to score two goals in the first half with that many chances
That assist from Dybala was sick
Roma started the game with the wrong approach,I think that Vlaovic’s goal in the first minute contributed to a first half to forget.. better the second half after Mou made a few changes and yet again scoring from a set piece ( corner)taken by Pellegrini touched acrobatically by Dybala back into the middle for Abraham header , one point gained but there’s a lot to work and room for improvement while waiting for Wijnaldum.. hopefully for Zaniolo  there won’t be to long to wait, this team has to keep focused and get better and better,Daje Roma!💛⚡️❤️
3:03 scenic
Allegri always picks weak szceny, rabiot with low contribution and selfish cuadrado
Ada yg pernah nonton bundesliga kostic mainnya gimana ga sih? 2 pertandingan crossingnya jelek bgt parah, klo ga ngarah, ke blok.. si kribo lg, giliran gampang ga di oper , klo susah temennya dy oper wkwkwkwkw
Well done Roma👏
Roma should sign ronaldo
what a goal vlahovic 🔥
Loyiq oyin 1. 1
ALEGRI OUT!!!
alex sandro is juve weak link. how does he lose dybala out there. juve needs to get another left back. miretti is special. wont be long before he is in the azzurri setup. juve really should have killed off roma. you cant leave teams hanging around
Coardardo out
Eldor Shomurodov could help to Roma😂😂
What a joke Allegri. Is it possible nobody realizes he should change jobs? He should not even coach Serie c teams.
Dybala fans like
2 squadracce che giocano un calcio primitivo, guidate da 2 allenatori che allenare manco sanno cosa significa.
Força inter de Milão
the time that Jose Mourinho manage Juventus is the time when Juventus win everything again, including UCL.
Cuadrado is a cancer
Thanks for this channel to quickly deliver the beauties of Seria A
1-0 Vlahovic 1-1 Abraham
Cuadrado please keep, played bad
Allegri out
stell camera love
Appreciate the admin here for an efficient upload of the highlight, if Roma bring in some reinforcement, surely they can be contender soon..
where did the roma fans go in second half
The world is coming to an end after you see referee's been calling by VAR against Juventus
im only here cus of pogba and winaldjum fifa showdown cards
Why disallowed locatelli goal?? Why reffere not advantage?
I saw the entire match and it was painful to see that Roma were unable to keep possession and their passing was terrible..I think the 2 injuries have affected the morale of the team..
Bratko
Juve under pressure when Rabiot out. Roma minus creativity, cause lost Zaniolo. That make Dybala & Tami isolated.
My Fav commentator
Kalau ga kipernya Rui Patricio bisa kebobolan banyak tu. Alhamdulillah satu poin aja cukup karena kalau lewat di kandang Juve susah 💪💪💪 Roma Dejavu salam Romanisti Cirebon timur
forza.juve
Forza LAZIO
Saya tidak terlalu suka dengan kiper Juve mudah kemasukan gol sepeninggal Buffon tidak terlalu tangguh tampil dominan seperti maignan GK milan
What An Assist from Dyballa Againts Former club'👀😯
fix match ,total matches of football is fixed and run bt table situation
The hug between mou and allegri is opposite of conte and tuchel haha
He Can't Free Kick Too #vlahovic
골이 왜 취소야????????????????
dybla come back
GO as roma
We're is chiesa first
Celik was great,he was very calm....he could neutralize kostic in right side....
what an incredible free-kick goal by the Serbian...https://youtu.be/Ed8hioNWMM4
I see vlahovic and cuadrado lose they chemistry
Roma to the top >>>> Serie A champs for sure
Roma didn't deserve the point. They were outclassed majroity of the game. Lots of Mourinho dickriders in the comment section who probably don't know how to kick a ball.
Taktik alegri kuno  Formasi back pass  Alegri out
Cuadrado foollss
Forza Juve
Second season mourinho in charge... Its look more carefully when meet juventus...
Anticalcio 🤮🤮🤮
As Roma still need 2 more defender, and 2 creative midfield player to create the game.
I want Tammy The Chammy to win scudetto for Mourinho
Taktik Alegri 👎👎👎👎
Sad to see Big Mou not winning here
King of the draw
What A free kick
Força Roma 🐺 🐺🐺🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
Forza Juventus Roma
Nice match...
Vlahovic Is an amazing player, but this child of 6 years old is not bad neither, what do you think? https://youtu.be/yllxymsFBRI
Replace the comentator and make it  like EPL making the game look fantastis and better to watch
Eldor Go
Bravo mourinho
T.Abraham is becoming a big time player. He's scored so many important goals for Roma
Now I love serie A because Jose Mourinho 👍

So who upgrades pogba or wijnaldium
Perché non fa giocare Perin questo gol non lo prendeva 100x100
Bremer with Danilo all day
Vlahovic second goal was sick .. oh well.. If only we didn't have that much player who injured 😔
#cuadradoout
Another poor performance in Turin from Roma. And what's Mou doing with a back 3?? There is all this talk about Romas transfer market. Things looked pretty similar to last year. Awful midfield aswell. Luckily Juventus played just as poorly or it was more points lost for Roma. We have to be better if we want top 4.
Vlahovic 👏🏻👏🏻

Am not satisfied with Mourinho's first half tactics. I wonder what he intends to achieve with that first half experiment before reverting to his second half winning formation and tactics. I believe AS Roma suppose to win this weakened Juv, even though they played away but this is a very weakened Juv team which any serious and determined top team like AS Roma suppose to win. Jose Mourinho need to sit up now, he should always start with his best eleven and the formation his team is comfortable with than meaningless experimentation. Jose shouldn't be decieved the season has Just began, Nope! Now is the right time he needs to pick up as much points as possible. Infact, am not satisfied with Roma's today's outing. They need to do more in subsequent matches. Am certain they'll win Seria A this season but to lift the Trophy they must be committed, determined, focused, humble, fearless and must always play every match as their lives depends on it. Most importantly, the players must ensure they remain loyal to Mourinho without minding his outburst or to blame some players publicly. That's his character but in all he only wants such players to improve for both their best interest and for the team to succeed and lift trophies. Certainly, at the end they'll all be happy and proud of their achievements collectively, that's what matters..  Wishing AS Roma and Jose Mourinho all the best.   Stand up for Seria A Champions AS Roma.   Jose Mourinho Fan from Chelsea till date.
Patricio from Hero.
Quardado too selfish wkwkwk
Look how weak Dybala is.. Juve keep Vlahovic as they star..
So glad for Dybala but so sad how he assists that goal at Alliance Arena for ex team mate. Only the old lady fans can't feel how sad Dybala. He still valid at Scudetto this year
Mourinho absolutely needs to play Zalewski from now on. Last season when Spinazola was injured Zalewski became a beast and I know that Spina is the main man but I'm sorry there's a new kid in town. Spinazola made a lot of mistakes in the first half. Jose changed his position in the 2nd half to put zalewski at his place and within 15 minutes you could tell the difference. He runs. He has skills. He skinned his marker in a tight angle on the wing at one point. He is so active both defensively and attacking wise. I just love to watch that player
For me, Allegri is enough, this man is never tired to dissapointed us, AS Roma playing so bad and Juve just did not desserved to play draw against Roma, we need to win this match, but with poor tactican manager like Allegri, Juventus will not go anywhere, so we need to sack this dumb coach and hire better coach like Zidane, Pochettino, or Gasperini, this dumb coach Allegri is finished for me, my eyes is sick watching Juventus games, they are so bad under Allegri 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ #AllegriOut
What a goal from Vlahovic , meine Mutter... !!  What a goaaaaaaaaal
Vlahovic the best young striker in the world.
Rui Patrício eh muito ruim
#AllegriOut #ZidaneIN
Forza Juve 🔥 Fino ala fine..
Esse goleiro da Roma é uma 💩
Miretti was great in midfield... cuadrado as always wasted his chance
Where is di maria?
Ibanez is the most underrated center back in the Serie A. He is top 10 for me, up there with Tomori, Kalulu, Bremer, Smalling, Skriniar, Rrahmani, etc.
Prima gutes Ergebnis für milan🤩🤩
Juventus for serie B 😂
Forza roma
Karsdorp makes way too many mistakes, we need to find a way to have both Spina and Zalewski play. Cristante and Mancini also make a few too many mistakes, but they make up for it with strong defending and build up play. Ibanez and Smalling are always in the right place at the right time.  I would like us to switch to a back 4 with Zalewski, Ibanez, Smalling, and Celik. Spinazzola has played as a CDM in the past, so he could maybe rotate with Matic, Cristante, and eventually Wijnaldum for those 2 CDM spots
Every goal juventus referee must be check a VAR 🤡🤡🤡🤡 what a league
Serial A is already competitive, no longer a one horse race..  Mourinho is gradually changing ROMA
FORZA ROMA 🐺🔴⚪
Amazing camera from Juventus stadium..like in a console👍👍👍
😭 haruse menang roma

Vlahovic should have taken both freekicks 😅
Allegri out
Surprisingly mbappe can't do what vlahovic did😱😂
Dybala said I have a unfinished business with allegri ,he was right 👍
Super Dybala!
Vlahovic doing vlahovic things
#allegriOUT
As a Juve fan, I mainly watched the game to see Dybala. Although his game was disappointing, there's no one in Juventus worth the attention. The team falls flat without a difference maker.
Merci
Anulir goal terus
Juventus is a joke🤣
Игра на кантору желеска как и бавария
It's ok Roma you'll still get the last laugh on the league table ;) let's go!
How is that a handball shocking refereeing
Aneh wasitnya walaupun sy bukan fans juve
Arek Milik save Juventus in first match 😅👍 02:47
Vlahović is not human🇷🇸♥️
Such a boring game of football between two giants of Italian football. This needs to change if we are to market Serie A properly. Milan, Napoli & Lazio are doing it right!
Mitrovic >>>>Vlahovic 😎
This is the kind of match Roma would've lost last season.
Lagi* juve d rugikan dengan var gk jelas
Kok peringkat'a malah turun sih juventus....
Rui patrício on national team mode!
Unconvincing Roma... Simply lack of attacking...
El sharawy still plays for AS Roma?
If you look at the starting lineups there is no reason why Roma can't go and attack Juve and beat them. Even win the whole league, no team is that strong.
Baru 3 pertandingan Massimiliano allegri mulai kehilangan arah
Noooooo, wijnaldum and pogba both got 97 rating 😩
Spectacular Goal by Vlahovic 👍👍👍. Improved performance by Roma.
#aleggriout
#aleggriout
I feel sorry for Dušan Vlahović. He choose to play under the wrong manager. ALLEGRI OUT!
JUVENTUS ERA IS OVER
With a team of dismissed/disbelieved players Mourinho will prove the detractors he's still one of the best managers in the world.
allegri...... 😀😀😀😀😀
it’s okey juve. don’t give up!
What a goal from Locatelli… but Italian ref keep being paid to stop Juve from progressing
allegri out,zidane in
se jugo un partidazo
This kind of approach may be enough for top 4, but if he wants something more, Mou has to change their mentality, too much respect for Juve. Pellegrini Nothing today, Spinazzola Nothing, Cristante almost Nothing, Abraham Nothing but the GOAL, Defence was OK.
Serie A is UNBELIEVABLY competitive right now.  🔥🔥🔥 Milan, Inter, Juve, Napoli, Roma, Lazio, Atalanta, Fiorentina etc. It's going to be a wonderful scudetto race
HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
Juventus need to buy Zalewski asap!
second goal should have count.............
Kudos to Smalling, his effort neutralized most of Vhalovic's threat
Juve don't have enough players to score goals.  Midfielder and fullback need improvement.  How long do we have to watch Sandro and Danilo???
Love inter Milan From Indonesian Love Jose Mourinho 2010
Italiani dove siete??🇮🇹
I don't really think Juve can get to their old tracks with Cuadrado and Rabiot. Defense 's not so strong as well. I mean yes, Vlahovic's stunning, Chiesa 'll be back at some point, Kostic 'll be fine...But some more great players have to show up.
But Roma done nothing the hole match , they didn't deserve that point , Juve were better . FINOALLAFINE🤍🖤
fixed match
I love Allegri's priceless reaction to Vlahovic goal as much as I love his suit
Forza Juve
Disgraceful VAR decision. Alot happened after that and it was hardly a hand ball. Footballs gone.
The two managers seem to have mutual respect for one another
locatelli's goal shouldnt have been disallowed
Go on Tammy!
Roma seems to be getting stronger
Juventus suc ks
How does Rovella not start over Rabiot? Rovella did more today in 6 minutes than Rabiot did all of last season.
That vlahovic handball for the disallowed  goal was accidental and had no bearing on the goal.....poor call from the var and referee....these things spoil the game
Is it just me or did all the Roma fans leave after HT 2:07
What a goal from Vlahovic.
Daje roma! ibukota italy
It just hit me I watch more Série A and Bundesliga matches than I do Premier league ones🫶
Jose knows how to manage team.. he is one of the world's best coach ... Lots of people watching only this match and writing negative comments . Roma need one more striker and 2 defensive guys .. jose will attack only if he thinks his team is capable or absolute necessary..  His tactics are based on his team and opponent team quality . Roma still need to invest money but this club is not like juve or man city
Forza Roma.! With squad tim still won
Di Tubuh Juve Sikap Egois Masih tinggi. Menurut saya.
Dybala came to haunt us back with that sick assist
nice faoul 2--0 haha
vlahovic career isn't going to be the best under this coach his style of play dont suit vlahovic and he should be building the team around him
Nice assist Dybala 👏👏
Juve scudeto karena varlah yg menghalangimu. Roma ga mampu menghadapimu
You gotta love how Mourinho make Serie A more interesting, entertaining, watchable, etc. Still special’
Bali Indonesia🇮🇩💙
Looking at the comments, not just in this one but football videos in general, so many "fans" of the game seem unable understand football beyond counting who scored how many goals.
Vlahovic- Mitrovic Serbia is ready for Qatar🇷🇸💪
Mr. Mourinio Give chance to Shomurodov.
Last season Juve would have won at least by 2 nil
Eh vabbè stavo allo stadio e posso dire un grandissimo primo tempo ma il secondo tempo VER GO GNO SO
Spirit Juventus ❤️💪
First time roma take result in home of juventus. Roma&murinhio going for the scudeto this year !!!
Have to give credit to this channel of how quick these highlights get published. Well done.
Zalewnski, Celik, and Sharawy should be in the first team..
great point for Roma Abraham counting his Goalscoring from last season into this season ❤️💛
Dusan Vlahovic
Ooooooh Tammy Tammy! Great to see him doing well in Rome!
#AllegriOut
Always Forzza Roma!💛❤
Tammy Abraham is the most underrated striker in Serie A.
Roma are looking like a real team these days. Zhang needs to axe Inzaghi and hire the special one asap.
The main problem is Schezny! He made another mistake but was lucky Roma didn't score the second one. Don't know why Allegri changed Perin after 2 perfect game. That's why sometimes I don't respect Allegri. Schezny doesn't deserve to play in Yuventus. We were playing in a high level so many years due to the Gigi Buffon!!!
Very negative approach from Mourinho in the first half. They showed them far too much respect. There is nobody to fear in this Juve team with all their injuries. Roma should have went for it. Smalling was outstanding - Vlahovic was in his back pocket all game. Overall points dropped from a Roma standpoint.
Juve midfield is soooooo bad.
Well done Jose .
Serie A
Juventus 1. Roma 1
AS Roma has to believe more in their capabilities, Juve was ready to lose in the second half. If the gialorossi want to achieve more than 4th place they have to play with less respect against these teams.
Juventus are finished can't win a game that the controlled 🤣🤣🤣
allegri out.... Forza juve
Nice game for both, but no upgrade for either pogba or wijnaldum showdown🥲
OK so I turned this game off as soon Juve scored what looked like a 2nd, had no idea it was disallowed. Was very surprised when I looked at the result at full-time. LOL Massive away result for Jose's team.
Иррати в своём - сволочном - репертуаре.
Is Paul playing
advantage for ROMA..DAJE!
Mourinho absolutely needs to play Zalewski from now on. Last season when Spinazola was injured Zalewski became a beast and I know that Spina is the main man but I'm sorry there's a new kid in town. Spinazola made a lot of mistakes in the first half. Jose changed his position in the 2nd half to put zalewski at his place and within 15 minutes you could tell the difference. He runs. He has skills. He skinned his marker in a tight angle on the wing at one point. He is so active both defensively and attacking wise. I just love to watch that player
Great game
Roma needs finishing touch. Jose Masterclass as always. Juventus with such budget sharing point with AS Roma 😄
Waktu Dybala di juve dia selalu jadi pahlawan mengalahkan Roma, dan sekarang dia jadi pahlawan Roma.👏👏
Shame they didn't count Locatelli's goal
La difesa della juve è imbarazzante
I honestly think this is a great point for Roma and a lost of 2 by Juventus 🤷🏾‍♂️. Roma could’ve easily lost by at least 3.
Forza roma
Mourinho masterpiece
Brilliant game
Roma 🙌
Alhamdulillah 1 poin. Masih belum kalah 😁
Amazing scissor kick from dybala. Hoping to see him get back to his best
After a weak first half Roma perfectly changed the game in the second half ..................
First 2 watch
Dybala contro il ez forza romaaa
First
Jose is master coach
Roma Jooooz
