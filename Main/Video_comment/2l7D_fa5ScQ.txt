so jokes
I think they are too rude to ppl.
So being American means that you're dump 😂  9:53
Yall Einstein's iq was like 160 or SMTH 164 is crazyyy dayummm
I would put the combined IQ of the entire Beta Squad below the average on this panel.
the girl with 70 iq looks too hot to be that low XD
I haven't closed my mouth to that 164 and 152 💀 bro that's higher than aj's height in cm
15:57 six sevenn
67
I thought the Rollex guy was playing it dumb, I thought he was 1 or 2, I forgot he fcked up all the questions
I had 164 IQ in Grade 5
is the hot girl quinn finite? she looks just like her
67
18:17 interesting choice of frames and alphabets but we'll go with it-
7:36 what does 2:1 2:2 mean?
15:40 67
15:58 67
11:10 HAHAHAH HELPPP😂
15:57 6 7!!
164 is literally smarter then Einstein… Einstein had 160
15:58 six what, six sevennnnnnn
There is 28 letters in the Danish alphabet, so technically she’s not wrong. You didn’t specify which alphabet 🧐😂
15:59 67 !!!!!!
Jasmine is my middle name
15:40 67?
alphabet question should be worded as: how many letters are in alphabet?
how did danny's IQ of 152 not end up with him being in the first place. The girl had an IQ of 139, which is insane!
Bro my iq is 124 😭 DO YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND THAT 164 IS SO MASSIVE
What are this questions 😂😂 Even my lil sis can answer The hell
15:58 best part of the video
All them are smart except for the two dumbest ones. Everyone else has an above average IQ.
Cheat code for this game in modern times: Put young people toward the dumb end of the line.  It was SUPER obvious that the young woman was by far the dumbest one.
18:58
15:55 67
At 19:07 is WILDDDDD
My rank before result 1. Coin guy 2. Old lady 3. Rich 4. Driver guy 5. Jasmine 6. American guy
Several of their questions they actually answered correctly… “The Alphabet” corresponds to the letters in sequence as the word “the” references it as a whole. If he wanted the word, he should have said “How many letters are in the word Alphabet?” So no, her logical reasoning was correct. Same for MANY of the other questions….
The hosts of this show clearly have no manners very offensive
ayy yo!? 164! my iq's only 127 vro
15:58 67 😛
15:57 SIX SEVEN 67 6 7
Isn't Danny the psychopath
15:41

16:00 SIX SEVENNNNN
Cube = 6 not 8
67??
HOW DID I GET EVERY ONE OF KENNY'S RIDDLES AND IVE NEVER EVEN HEARD A SINGLE ONE BEFORE
Woww she has more iq then Einstein 😮
DANG WHEN ABBY SAID HER IQ I WAS GAGGED. THATS CRAZY HOLY MOLY WHAT. My IQ is 148 and I’ve never met a person who’s IQ is higher than 150, SO I WAS SO SHOCKED OMG ABBY HUMBLE QUEEN
lol.  My IQ is at least 4.  :)  I had a bunch of tests as a child.
How can these guys judge IQ when they can barely speak English.
IQ doesn't correlate with being smart basically at all
15:57      67.......
16:02
I can’t with niko😂😂😂
my dad has a BUNCH of tattoos and he graduated from uc Berkeley
8:42 bro did NOT say niko
15:58 ..
15:57
15:58 SIX SEVEN 😜😜
15:57 67...
To be fair to the American guy, I've heard both "eye" (I) and "envelope" be used as the answer to the "what starts with e, ends with e, but only has one letter in it" riddle. It might not be the answer they intended, but it's still an answer that fits the riddle.
Haha….imagine calling earth flat and then ranking others based on IQ
15:57 I can’t help it ok
15:57 say that again
School≠smart
The people on the stage feel so embarrassed, it looks a bit like they’re mocking them
67
15:58 67
Acually if you said what WAS the president’s name then your talking about the president in the 1990 if you say what is the president’s name in the 1990 then you can say that
Jasmine's IQ is definitely not 70. Some people just don't have the patience to go through an iq test, she might have answered randomly out of boredom.
I'm curious what the IQ's of the "judges" are... By how they act I'd be surprised if they are in the 3 digit realm..
This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen, these people are giving logically correct answers to riddles, but then are being told they're wrong because it's not the answer the asker was looking for.  Like, a Keychain does hold keys and can't open doors, and asking how many letters in the alphabet, both 11 and 26 are correct answers - knowing what someone is thinking is not IQ based whatsoever.  Dorks.
Yeah I seriously doubt here actual iq is 164 she couldn't even perform 1st grade math, probably a scuffed ass online iq test lmao
say those last 2 numbers again? 15:41
15:57 🤷‍♂🥀
Even 125 is incredibly smart. 164 is absolutely wild
16:28 thats such a extra way to say he died on his birthday 💀
First of all, which IQ?
A bunch of rude ignorant guys laughing of their own stupid slurs
did he just say 67
15:58  67
152 and 164 are genius Mensa level.
Why are they always clowns? It's in their DNA, isn't it.
I'm not impressed with our panel of "judges". They sound like their table is very low IQ.
They definitely didnt an actual iq test probably on of those normal ones on the Internet cuz no way they have  152 164 😂😂
15:57 6 7???
15:58 bro predicted it
16:00 67
love Kane the coin colecter this guy seems so lovley
I don't think IQ plays a big role in life. I got 133 or 135 i don't remember. My country was average 70 and when the teachers changed classes I was highest IQ with 20+ higher than second highest and they put me in class A. Obviously I don't study, I sleep in class, I fight for fun and i never kept rules. And sometimes there are a lot of stuff I can learn from my friends. Having more IQ doesn't mean you know more. From my experience, I think its just how fast you can learn.
0:51 & 1:06 & 1:35 & 2:27 & 2:48 & 4:00 & 4:50 & 5:45 & 13:08 & 17:21 & 17:49 & 18:58 & 19:29 & 20:17 & 22:10 & 23:09 & 23:50
iq doesn't equate to intelligence level. einstein got like 162 or something, yet people with 180 iq haven't changed how the world works or can even understand eintein's way of thinking and his equations.
7:44  Ooooooo go on bad GyAl🤏🏼😂 Clock it Niko😂
15:40
15:57 what did she just say
is the thired  actor ? i saw his face in serie before
15:57 she knew....
1) Chunkz 2) Niko 3) Sharky 4) AJ 5) Kenny
12:20 australasia isnt a continent tho
15:57 67 moment.
Danny my man is a chill guy. Looks like islam makachev
16:11 AJ saying “how do you know about combs!?” Got me rolling on the floor. I didn’t hear and just Carried on but then it clocked and I burst out laughing
16:13 AJ was wild'in on that one😭
164 and 152 thats crazy ahahaha
15:58 she knew something.
11:10
Rich has had all the Es
15:56 SIX SEVENNNNN
How did they not realize how smart 164 iq is? They literally have one of the smartest people on earth right infront of them. 140 is the genius, but 164 is just megamind.
15:41 67!!!
I think the test they took is not accurate.  160+ is genius level 70 is mentally challenged level  I'm sure something went wrong.
The police guy honestly felt like he himself is a pred so he just finds all kinds of loopholes and all the perfect responses just so that he can be safe lmao. Because why tf was he finding all kinds of excuses to NOT arrest the guy who admitted to his crimes and had physical evidences??
How is her iq 164 but she cant do a maths question...
The idiots are sitting at the table. Hard to watch tbh
What is the models name
brother that american guy is so honest every time
15:56 6 7 BOII
I love how 90% of their questions are just memorization and not iq related lmao
When they say Niko i definitely hear something else :/
fax sharky and aj shabeel are from netherlands
fax chunkz is somalian
fax aj shabeel is from netherlands
The Fact that you have to search everything from google and chat to find the answer for yourself that's what I had to do
Yeah 164 iq for Customer Service and 150iq for delivery guy  🥀
Well my iq is a 110 agtwr doing a dumb 2 hour test that it seemed only really test for memorization and how well you can remember principals, equations and rules good test but really only for those skills of memory and recollection
20:38 is my rank fr
15:57 SIX SEVENNNNN
There’s no way Abby has a 164 .I have an estimate of 150-160+  and I’ve been around intelligent people my whole life. I’d say she’s about a 130 iq, and iq tests can slightly vary , but it’s most certainly not what she claimed it to be .There’s no point in arguing or obsessing over iq.
15:40
She just seems smart. Like I the way she carries herself, As did the Amazon flex driver, however the job threw me off but he’s probably retired.. and anyone sho is intelligent is going to find a way to make their own schedule for sure.
15:57 time traveler??
Turd squad.👎
What a bunch of idiots
That eye answer was actually pretty good. Not the answer of course, but starts with e, ends with e, and has only one letter (I= eye). Obviously it kind of doesn't make sense and obviously not the right answer, but also quite clever off the dome.
*_”HOW U KNOW ABOUT COMBS, AKHI??!! U DONE NEED ONE”_* 😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣☠️☠️ _underrated _*_affffff_*
11:24 227
These questions have nothing to do with IQ bro, this is trivia.
Chunkz at 9:10 im crying
6 7😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
15:57 67
Just as reference einsteins it is 160 btw
Can someone pls explain what the first insult meant?
Wow.. they found a 152 and 164 to join the show. Only 1 person in a 100k has an IQ of 164 or higher. So there are only 680 people in all of UK with an IQ equal or higher than that lady. That's insane.
I would like to say be wary of IQ tests as they do not account for certain aspects of intelligence. Many tests exclude sciences, emotional/psychological intelligence among other things. Many are also culturally exclusive. To label someone smart or dumb based on a narrow range of testing is "stupid" to say the least. For instance, if you took someone from a tribe in the amazon and gave a standardized IQ test you may label them "borderline" intelligence comparatively. However, if you tested their ability to solve problems in the amazon compared to a city person they will likely be a genius and may consider the city dweller "borderline" by their standards. A politician may be terrible in math and vocabulary but a master emotional manipulator, and maybe had to develop that intelligence in navigating a very different reality/lifestyle than someone else. Point being, there are different facets to intelligence so do not put too much faith in an IQ test.
So the stereotype was proven right then 😂 models do be dum dum
10:46 Are you guys stupid ?
Never saw this channel before. What a bunch of losers and douchebags... 10M followers... we're doomed for sure.
No way she had iq under 85, no way. Although if she really didnt know the digits that make up a billion...
There is zero chance she is 164 IQ. You would never get that number from professional psychometric testing, and not be able to do 2 digit arithmetic math. The real psychometric tests take mental processing speed into account since you're on a timer, the questions get brutal the further along you go on the lists they use. You can be a genius but bad at math, for example Richard Feynman the famous physicist had 125 IQ, but you get tested on multiple areas and critera, if you're some spatial processing and pattern recognition prodigy, but still really bad at math, it's still going to be impossible to get above 140 IQ.
16:12 Bro did not deserve that lol
So 2 persons with the genius level IQ just cassualy up on stage???
I would murder at this game
14:38 aren’t they just dead wrong about this? I thought bush was president in 1990?
10:46 *E.*
Owww MY GOD Jasmine Looks AMAZING With Those Glasses and Look at her Eyes Hooo Weee Id Marry Her
As someone young, I got most of these questions right
These same guys complain about racism later… When they literally bully others, show their primal intelligence and can’t even use proper grammar. Yikes.
Questions couldve been better
I was so wrong
It's like they're bullying those people
Sad this was conducted by assholes.
These little boy judges are very disrespectful.
Guys how can i measurr my IQ
helo
Abby’s iq is more than Albert instines that’s wild
they took an online iq test
DANNY IS SOOOO CUTEEEE ❤
Why black people rate white people , not fairly
19:43 - Bro your the fucking goat ! That tatoo is so dope ! Oh and the way you affirmed yourself being collected and calm, respect.
Danny seems like such a nice man fkn love his vibe
Niko always guesses correct🎉
I'm only half way through and looking forward to the bidding at the end
There are several intelligence tests. IQ is a good indicator, but not 100% reliable.
11:00 LMAOOOO
😂
Riddles are absolutely stupid and questionable 😅
These guys who guess don’t have any respect to people, they behave themselves like bullies and they are looking from top on them.
152 and 164 they should be working in a lot better place i wonder how they ended up with that jobs even though they are pretty damn smart like wow.
13:54 STOP HELP PLS THE "AUTHUBILLAH" FROM CHUNKZ PLS LMFAOO
They are so stupid, please change them because the idea is perfect
this should have them  make a ranking separately then the person who done the worst do a challenge.
3:10 this was foreshadowing
11:10 STOP HELP PLS I CANT BREATHE OMGG 😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏
9:07 STOP HELP PLS OMGG 😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏 I CANT BREATHE PLSS OMGG
There's absolutely no way abby couldn't make the calculation in head like in a sec. was she sending us?
4:42 it‘s actually daniel adegbajumo (or sum) niko…
Btw. Albert Einstein had an IQ of 160, she couldn't possibly have an IQ of 164. I'm not saying she isn't smart, just very likely possible.
This would clearly indicate the iq test was one of those online tests. The 70 nor the top 2 ppls iqs are believable but considering how they reacted to the 164 it seems they dont understand that or know the test was untrustworthy
They got pi wrong it’s 3.14159
11:10 the switch of accent immediately 😭😭
how do you its comb you dont need one from aj had me dying🤣😭
jasmine lowkey pissed me off😭😭 no hate to her though, she seems so sweet and humble and self aware but to have such low GENERIC & COMMON knowledge as a model is crazy
Awww the way AJ said “it’s still a first, don’t downplay that” to Abby 🥹🥹 the performance arts aren’t as appreciated or seen as “smart” compared to STEM so it was precious seeing AJ validate that
If she has an IQ of 164, I am a red all over and black all over rectangular circle.
I thought Rich had the highest IQ,  his  IQ is still very high at 119
Not knowing pi and some simple maths? She was sandbagging
la ragazza con iq più alto è confrontabile benissimo con un ragazzo normalissimo qui in italia 💀💀💀
What kind of chopped test are they taking if they have a 70(mentally stunted) and 164(super ultra genius)
Wallahi Aj is so funny😭16:11 hear what he says
Omg, the model is gorgeous,  any one news her account?
W love watching this
I have a 78 IQ and I’m 8 years old
There is no legit way to measure Intelligence, Iq test was invented to see who will do better in schooling systems, you may suck at school but you may the most gifted rapper, or idk writer of fiction etc... everyone has its own capabilities, there also some type of people who can adapt at anything given and be better than average on anything.
Did this vid make anyone else go and do an online IQ test lmaoo
It's really bad to abuse elders..
9:09 😂😂😂
monkeys judging people😅
look who are ranking them
So Abby was acting dumb.  She didn’t even try to answer any of their question. She also added her degree was in drama. 😂
19:07    the way AJ smelt chunkz 😂😂
1. Chunkz, 2. Niko, 3. Sharky, 4. Kenny, 5. Aj
Yeah, im calling bs. You telling me they got 2 super geniuses on one panel. 164 iq is smarter than 99.9%+ of people. The second smartest in the room would be smarter than 99.8% of all people. Then the 3rd probably actually knows how iq works, which is why he's 2 standard deviations lower than the one above him. If they took a test beforehand to determine iq, then your test was faulty.
chunks genius level but me too also genius level!!!!!!! ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
6 5
225 chunks
164 iq and cant do math ?
The questions are soo easy how can they not know
maybe my favorite thumbnail.
Their value of pi was 3.1415167 but it's actually 3.141592654. That's the calculator value at least. 💀
Chunks be seeing every body even their…
man this show is super disrespectful not taking the card is a jerk move trying to look cool this isnt comedy this is sheetshow
Jesus, how old are these guys, acting like in 5th grade, quite embarassing.

Abby has me doubting her. I mean she wasn’t even able to solve a simple math question.  She might be good at verbal and spatial IQ but still numbers make up one third of it so I don’t see her cracking 130.
It feels like old times, but in reverse 🎉
None of those questions would determine IQ!
Why are they so rude with rich ?
i think the beta squad order is backwards
Jan it's low I got 188IQ
As someone with an IQ of 158 who doesn’t really look the part, this video brought me much joy
The order of the highest iq in the beta squad is: ( 1st) Chunkz, Niko ,Sharky, Kenny, Aj ( last)   No offence!!
chunkz niko sharky aj kenny would be smartest to dumbest order
Every once in a while, I come to this video just to see Danny.
These numbers are absolutely wild and inaccurate i don’t believe they did a legit test
I believe that is the order
For comparison, albert einstein is around 160
19:08 😭🙏🏼
albert einstein's iq is between 160 and 180 SO HOW IS SHE 164 and the last girl said her iq is 70 the iq to have mild mental retardation is between 50 to 70
ik yall prolly already know this but just a reminder that iq isnt really a good measure of intelligence, nor does the concept of "intelligence" have any universally agreed definition
164 is crazy smart she's amazing
13:36 I DIED WHEN CHUNKZ ASKED THAT💀💀💀💀💀
Black guys judging of others is the most funny thing i saw today😂
Love How The Editor misspell "Because"
Anyone from 2025? 👇
Rick"australasia" -Chunkz yes he is right😂
skinhead
I just hate the way Nico called the man d*** that's really disrespectful
1:23 GEWPERMAN 😂
Honestly don’t believe her IQ. She couldn’t solve simple questions. My husband is like 134 ish and would’ve responded every single one of this/m
These vocals be hittin hard 8:41
blud
Amount of people uneducated about IQ is staggering. 100 is average, SD is 15. 160 is the maximum of most (properly accredited) tests, since at that level is becomes so abnormal it's difficult to differentiate. Her IQ is not 70, that's critically diagnosable as learning difficulties. Her IQ is also not 160 something, with all due respect everyone I've met with an IQ over 130 is noticeably smarter than she is, by a long way too. This IQ test they did is clearly a total gimmick. Needs to be done by a trained psychologist usually, and takes several hours.
the australisa had me done
If we learned anything, it's that the guys in charge of asking the questions only revealed their own lack of intelligence...they learned nothing of relevance of their contestants, except with their education background.
This channel is shit and so is the crew. You guys have nothing but attention
CHUCKS.. 21:09
not that we can see niko underwear throughout the video
a rare find, there are more than 3 times more males than females with IQ's above 130.
Man these guys are unbearable
15:40 that isnt even right gng
2 absolute geniuses, one of them working as a delivery driver for amazon... life is crazy... the coin collector, special needs, but almost genius-level iq (starts around 130)... 119 also, above average... but 152 and 164 is actually crazy, that's Einstein and Hawkins level...
Jasmine a baddie
Chunkz, Niko, Sharky, AJ, Kenny
ዝግንኝሽርምጥ
lol bulling so cringe, bunch of beta hypocrit racists
11:49 made me spit out my drink
This is so stupid, pommies are sogay
d
Isn’t 70 IQ the lowest you can be before you’re mentally challenged?
after watching a movie I can confirm that I cannot go wrong with BS, wish I was here with my dinner instead of that flipping movie
164 IQ but cant do 10 years old math equation. What a bullshit video i watched.
damn albert einsteins iq is like 160
Absolutely the worse case of disrespect I’ve ever seen, if those 5 were on stage and were treated like they treated the 6, there would be fists thrown, absolutely asinine.
28 letters in the alphabet is crazy.
Abby did bad-she reversed
Be more respectful next time 😊
kenny is definitely the dumbest
So that means the Chinese people are god level genius.
Guys, those type of questions can not be used to determine iq
These 5 idiots picking out  smart people :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D
bro whos the girl 🙈
Why do all of them have British accents? They are from Africa correct?
I also do not believe Abby is 164, she doesn't function like anyone with a high IQ.  Also none of these people are truly gifted at all.  Smart and intelligent isn't the same thing.  Anyone can be smart in a subject with education, Abby taken a facebook IQ test.  These are all avg people.  None of these people are gifted at all, it's almost sicken. I would bet a large sum of money if anyone was actually above 130 here.
"How'd you know bout combs, you don't need one" LOL
5:53 Beta squad a G for the promo. Most ppl wont do that
11:28 The word "incorrectly" isn't in the dictionary because it's a variant of the word "incorrect". 14:42 Actually Joseph Robinette Biden if you will so. 15:38 After the 4th digit he got everything wrong and they didn't even check if he said it correctly. I'll take the challenge and see how far I can go without a mistake. 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944592307816406286208998628034825... that's it, I don't know any more.
Nah, normal peeps is never near 70
10:59 I canttttttt 😂😂😂
The judges surely are not geniuses.
10:36
these guys are laughing their heads of with their mates having a good time. peak male experience
Why are they all talks like an idiot and is idit how could he said 54 its basic maths
Praise God. Amen.
Praise God. Amen.
Praise God. Amen.
"He looks good today,He looks good"😂😂😂😃
Why is nobody talking about minute 2:29
6:35  -it's call freeman brothers -free the brothers, i like that  😂😂😂😂
2:28 my G was mewing
Models @?
152 n 164! Holy sh*t!
Jesus Christ has Risen and wants a relationship with You. You don’t have to be perfect to accept him. Ask for forgiveness and if You believe in Your heart that Jesus died for your sins and rose from the dead you will be saved and have eternal life. Refer to John 3:16
This doesn't seem right. An iq of 70 would make you exceptionally stupid it's far below the average and 164 is way too high it's in the far right of the 4th quartile, not saying it's impossible but if she couldn't answer basic math questions I doubt the tests were accurate. This is coming from someone with an iq of 144
Squad of betas loool
all of these are wrong, jasmine doesn't seem dumb enough to have an iq of 70 and abby isn't smart enough to have an iq of 164
Cant believe this video got so many views.. i find it very stupid. Not funny at all, not respectful towards the guests...
14:24 kenny saying rio 😭😭😭😭
Rio😂
the first two are genius, but also the third and the fourth are really smart
Abby definitely looks like the type of mother to think those iq tests online are real, but shes 120 at max
These guessers are really annoying
70iq????
Why do they act like monkeys, screaming all the time and moving erratically. So annoying.
abby has more iq than einstein had...
11:20     225?
My iq is 135 iv never met anyone more than a 140
13:03 ☠️☠️
jasmine was leng
Bro forgot crypto currencies
What is this show? Are these guys the best qualified to figure out who is smartest
22:36 albert einstein's iq was around 160 so thats REALLY ipressive
8:40 CHUNKS HIT ITTT
Props to all of these contestants for having to deal with these imbeciles, my god. Also notice how they put the women in the bottom three…
Ngl tho, Jasmine a baddie
I got tested in Uni in Morocco and found out I had exactly 131 . I have this weird attraction to Jasmine ..; Maybe natural selection wants the kids to get that 100IQ
I haven't seen the end but It's clear they have no idea what intelligence is. Their just asking information regurgitation questions instead of testing their problem solving abilities and adaptability. Memory, which is necessary to regurgitate information, is only one part of a whole spectrum of intelligence.
164 🧢
The word that starts with an e and ends with a e can be "eye" not I.
Kenny fr Simping on that first round😂
Its crazy the there is somone with 276 IQ
I miss filly
Where is sharky’s shirt from??
"How do you know about combs, you don't need one" 💀16:12
Not me being smarter than adults at the age of 12, also these people are geiniuouses!!!!! They have an iq of 164 and 152 that’s mental
Mine 153 wbu guys
Don't disrespect an older person please 🙂
Thought they would put someone that works for free the brothers immediately to 1
162 is incredibly high but not being able to do a bit of addition on the spot is strange.
Interesting that the smartest two people have "low status" menial jobs!
Kinda funny how the final line-up looks like a normal distribution curve height-wise!
A bunch of rude and dumb Somalis ridiculing and ranking white people.  Great job with the race baiting!
16:13 AJ wild
The beta quad iq has to be less than 10. Combined score
Einsteins IQ is 160
With all respect to everyone, but i really doubt the test they took was a trustable one. First because the tests are designed to peak at 160 points, and based on the behavior and the answers i doubt a genius would do in this certain way, either the IQ would be a bad test to see true intelligence.
okay so abby is smarter than albert einstein if she has 164 iq which i doubt.
"what does reticent mean" LOL Not knowing certain words doesn't necessarily mean someone is less bright. I did wonderlic the other day and there were a couple of words that I'd only seen in GRE or something. Someone lacking education or speaking English as foreign language wouldn't know those words. Dyslexia would also make such tests extremely challenging. Edit: I think the text book has changed over the years and I remember clearly when I attended school, I did learn there were five continents. I think that's also partially why there are five Olympic rings.
Bro Einstein had 160 they the biggest liners I ever heard
I totally guessed 2% for redheads too. Well it was an educated guess I... guess.
"How did you know about combs you don't need one!" is fucking hilarious
Bro couldn't think of "digger"?
"Would you accepy dick?" "I don't like that qeustion" 🤣
As a psychologist, I can assure you that she doesn't have an IQ of 164. Not because she didn't manage to do a simple addition, but simply because there is no official IQ test that can measure beyond 160. The test that we use nowadays is the WAIS IV, the maximum score is 160.
70 is crazy…..☠️
“Albert Einstein walalkisi(brother)” is crazy💀💀💀
Did they take offical IQ tests or some random online ones or they just guessing?
Thanks for having me!  Had tons of fun and enjoyed!  I hope y’all enjoyed as well! - Abby
They took IQ test from temu
I mean we can tell that the table judging aren't the brightest bunch.
I’m 10 when I was six my iq was 131
I am going to guess that number 4 is the smartest. I would also like to know who was able to pay for their college.
YESSS MY 2 FAVORITE SLYTHERINSSSS❤❤❤
i discovered that i'm smarter than i thought i was today
Bro I hate the American guy that had to represent us because he’s making all of us look down
Make  who is the smartest beta squad 👌 😮❤
So the most intelligent person in the room arranged them according to her emotions
Her IQ was higher than Albert Einstein That’s just insane
Sharky Americanised it for mark 😂
FINALLY MSA THANKYOU SO MUCH FOR THIS ILOVEYOUUUUUU
16:12  I died💀💀
YouTube gettin real comfortable with two 15 second ads
Didn't even need to ask any questions, just scanned the line rapidly and clocked the woman with the red hair. She looks bright, alert, aware. And yes that rhymes.  I have an IQ of 142 officially measured when I was 10, I've partaken in a few IQ tests since, scoring between 133 and 172, so your IQ can be a variable entity, depending on type of questions and wellbeing.   Of course there are other tests and ways of measuring intelligence, spatial, linguistic, emotional, ad nauseum.
8:43 that was NOT niko
They should’ve asked an emotion related question people with higher IQs tend to have lower EQs
I’m only 16 but I thought I was doing good on 138 IQ before I saw this video 😂
Permission to download it
5:11  LMFAOOO
Bro… 70 is litterally monke level… 120 is like highly intelligent, 150 is genius, 160 is like albert einstein working at customer service💀
I would have assumed people with 70 IQ would be retarded😅. But she seemed normal. Also the guy with 151 was 2nd!!! How did they even find a 164
What are these stupid questions theyre asking? Theyve got nothing to do with IQ
W Shakespeare - it wasn't same day? my wrong? ( 16:25 )
higher IQ than einstein is outrageous.
I think its a bit weird she's got same IQ as Einstein...
bro what iq test did they take?? coz 164 is literally smarter than einstein
I don't feel like they appreciated how high 152 and 164 is ..
I do not believe that girl's IQ is 70. For those that don't know, IQ is scored 0-200 and the average is 100. To have an IQ of 70 means you either gotta have some abnormal talent like her (modelling) or you'll be working in a factory your whole life.
16:08 "how do you know about combs? you don't need one" hahahah
"How do you know about combs, you don't need one" is mental wallahi 😆😆😆😆😆😆
18:54 KENNYYY 😭😭
No way her the last two IQs are that low. That would mean they couldn't follow basic instruction. That's a mentally handicapped range.  They were able to answer questions, so I'm doubting the validity of these IQ tests.
festiwalowej swierzosci zapodac bit
😊
I love you
''Australasia'', all the boys are like yeah, yeah thats right. Uhm no thats not a continent.
I can say all the 200 numbers in pi
jasmine pretty tho ngl
7:15 the way the editor clocked how weird that was 😂
When I first new beta squad I thought Kenny was ksi 😂😂😂
in the start, they are just being rude and making the first guy that showe d up uncomfertable. then they just act like kids making baseless conclusions on "smartness level" .
15:40 bro got it wrong on the 5th decimal and got congratulated smh
164...what?
i think chunkz is the smarter
3.14159. Why are they skipping the 9?
Love Danny :)
You people in the comments don’t seem to know the difference between intelligence and education. You can have an extremely high IQ and no education.
How are some of these people getting some wrong that I got right
best question to ask is what is your iq
AJ was actually right, there are 13 species of fox, What are the odds
The guy with tattoos reminds me so much of Johnny Lawrence from cobra Kai
The guy with tattoos reminds me so much of Johnny Lawrence from cobra kai
13:00 if you’re talking about the word “alphabet” then u can’t say “the alphabet” cuz it means the whole alphabet. u have to say it without “the” so it wouldn’t’ve worked there
Whos here july ‘24 😂? Btw I really liked Danny he looked so humble 🫶🏼💗
Why is 8 sides on a cube the correct answer ?
The american has to be a moron😂
Wow...standard adult IQ tests only measure upto a max IQ of 162...Abby's really something
Y’all realize the average IQ is 100, right? We’ve got 119, 125, 152 and 164. These are some smart people. Anyone under 90….😅
chunks is the smart one
No way theres anyone whos iq more than 120
she has more iq than Einstein 💀💀
Yes we love Star Gate fans! Wasnt' expecting that
Chunkz was crushing on the model girl Im sure
an IQ of 164 and great vibes!!
9:06 HAHAHAH
11:06 I love how when Sharks talks in an American accent the guy immediately understands 💀
bro aj is smarter than you all personally because he shows it every video, he just does not care.
20:57 pull up your pants🤮🤮🤮🤮🤢🤢🤢💩😷😷😷
no way theswe two are 150 plus
Rich definitely spins ska and rocksteady, and is the best dancer there!
they don found NPCs except for the model
Its fucking hilarious how they bash & disrepect the elder contestants, when they are a bunch of scruffy delinquents. Content is dope, execution; toilet humor level. Wish other channels would pick this up.
Bro Jasmine is smth else 70 iq is retardation. She does not seem retarded (no one get offensed)
Just look for the dorky nerdy looking person.
2:21 4:16 9:56 11:09
anyone noticed how Danny sounded on the verge of tears everytime he spoke?
more like, who knows the most
It’s funny reading the comments of everyone here claiming to have an iq over 130, that’s just a blarant lie. Only 2% got that.
they got the highest and lowest guys still in the normal distribution correctly, humans are probably pretty good at figuring out how smart each other are up to a point of predictability, IQ changes from normally distributed to power low distributed in the 130s
These black people are so rude, why
If I need to introduce someone to beta squad this is the video I will show them, Niko was full of lame ass jokes in this vid.
164 iq? That’s like minimum 5 away from Albert Einstein.
Her IQ is “Exceptionally gifted”
Zygote had me rolling 😂😂😂😂
My iq was measured when i was 13 -15 and they gave me an estimated IQ of 163 I undertook multiple test given to me by psychologist and psychiatrists numerous times. I excell during the learning phase in almost any activity sports included but tend to lose interest very quickly and plateau. I fail at life daily, I suffer from depression and I'm constantly bored with life. I also find it hard to make friends as most people and their life experiences don't interest me. Having a high iq is a curse, nothing good has come of it. All it gave me was the ability to fall short of the expectations others had instiled in me, im also dislexic and have audible and visual hallucinations, I hardly sleep and now my memory is going to shit. My dad always said I should donate my brain to science because I never used it... All that being said I highly doubt these IQ scores are accurate.
16:12 nah they violating kane 💀💀
6:57 danny is guiltyyy
Take jasmine to your next blind date she kinda🔥🔗
Y’all do not know how to respect your elders 🥱
My rank: 5. AJ 4. Shark 3. Kelly 2. Chunkz 1. Nikko
My iq is 135
Jasmine! Get that lass off the stage! She thinks the English alphabet has 28 letters! She’s so dumb!
man i aint tryna say nothin but i knew jasmine was gonna be last here with a lower number from the start💀
for reference, the probability that a person has a higher IQ than abby is about 0.00099207%
i feel bad for rich
We all know who is the stupidiest there
Chanks, Niko, Charky, Kenny and then AJ according from smartest going downwards
What’s jasmines socials
As a top member of Mensa and having the privilege of spending hours with absurdly smart, intelligent people all day, I can safely say that society is stupid as hell. I'm so glad I'm not an idiot like most people. So blessed.
i would put the order from lest to greatest iq aj kenny sharky chunks niko
Do more of this one plz 😂
What IQ tests did they administer? How are they finding so many geniuses for these shows? Individuals who genuinly have such high IQs are incredibly rare. Richard Feynman, who won the Nobel Prize in physics obtained the IQ score of 129 if I recall...so this is a little crazy. I am sceptical.
“I went to a special needs school”   Sharky: “Ok interesting”  8:20
My opinion i have have been watching beta squad recently so in my perspective niko>sharky>chunkz>kenny>aj
idk why but y’all were extremely rude
16:10
No way you have an IQ over 160 and cannot get the addition and subtraction easily in your head
Top 0.5% percent of the world is half 😭
Sharky waving was so inoccnet 😂0:03
Chunkz is smartest!😂
I neeeeeeed jasmines @
had both the top scorer's in the top 3 positions at least. Happy with that. Rich and coin were the ones I was unsure about, but I knew both were in the middle, just not in which order. I knew that at least ONE of them was in 4th, and the other was probably in 3rd. American guy I was a bit dubious about. But I knew for sure that Model was last. That was blatant from the get-go. I wasn't 100% if cob-webs was smarter than American guy, but I thought he probably was.  But I had my 2 top scorer's pegged from the start. Even before he said anything, I knew mr reticent spends a lot of time reading, and probably playing intellectual games of some type. He just works to pay the bills to get back to his passions. I was a little surprised he lost out to the redhead, but it was hardly entirely unexpected. That was an option in my book.
Damn, two geniuses out of 6 people.
The lowest IQs are obviously owned by the  beta squad😂
There’s 3 Americas, not 2 LMAO
if this is the top entertaiment for the UK teens and so, I pitty you so, so much. Is not one stupid youtuber, is a full group of them.
The stupids are seated.
13?
Damn Yasmine is a beauty. Any1 know her Insta? aksing for a friend.
the youngest being at the end is crazy because score skew down with age
Im glad to see stargate reference here :D haha
"Define the word 'come.'" To be fair, he wouldn't have known whether they were referring to "come" or "c*m."
12:23 BRO IM DYING AS A PROUD AUSTRALIAN “ Australasia “ IS SO HILARIOUS TO ME😭😭😭
1-chunks (120-130) 2-Nikko (110-120) 3-sharky (110) 4-AJ (100) 5-the other one forgot his name (90) remember this comment and do the test beta squad
Abby was the smartest concerncing her IQ and the funniest too lmao
any last words💀
i personally feel like they should give them a chair to sit too.. must have been tiring to stand for half an hour or more :/
11 letters in the word alphabet hahahaha
15:00 that riddle is just incorrect a fire can drink just not water does gasoline not exist?
My IQ is 135
My IQ is 135 and it's hard to live life because you understand everything. I can't imagine 164. Having high IQ makes you as autistic as a low IQ person.
11:18 Shouldn't the answer be 225?
And I thought my 118 IQ was smart 😭
How do you know your IQ ranking
Question 1) Did you take the shot?
why did they act like 164 is average dawg bro is smarter than urs truly
21:03 absolutely violated Niko
: 19:08  mate thought we didn’t see him
I GOT THE PIONO ONE!!! IM SMART
I thought filly was a part of beta squad
chunkz spoke in somali daaaam
School smart, yes sure Chunks, but I think Niko is smarter. Aj's smart as well, had he received same level of education, it would've been clearer to see.   1. Niko 2. Chunks 3. Aj 4. Sharky 5. Kenny
It's like ask them to estimate the level people speak French, while niether of them speaks French themself :)
Her IQ is higher than Einsteins, but she couldn‘t solve a simple math problem…
Damn she's basically Albert Einstein. And that white bearded man is the literal embodiment of don't judge a book by its cover or in this case by profession
My guy, the amazon Flex Delivery guy
I personally think, that you (The Beta Squad) should get IQ-tested, 'cause y'all got questions, which have nothing to do with IQ!
i feel like she’s lying about her iq, 164 is genius level and having 2/6 people be over 140 is ridiculous. only a handful out of a hundred will be over 130 let alone 140 and 160
Why yall for real believing in this😂😂😂
Note that both the ones with a 150+ IQ knew they were smarter than average. People think humility equals intelligence. It does not. To an intelligent person, accuracy is what matters, and whether or not the answer is humble or not is irrelevant when answering a factual question. What seems like bragging to others is not, it's just fact.
what a bunch of annoying morons
Those questions got nth to do with IQ lmao
I dislike the way they calculate IQ entirely.... because it is all based on maths, spelling, colours and memory.... so.... saying that, they then mean that every colorblind person, every dyslectic person and every language genius person (coz usually people are either good at math or language) is stupid..... and lapse of memory should not be considered stupid, because it will happen to every genius in the end as well....
16:12 😭😭
I love how beta squad laugh and end up hugging each other
18:04
nah abby was wrong i think its: aj (last), kenny, niko, sharky, Chunkz (first)
bro...even 119 is damn lot
This is the order I've chosen for Beta Squad from most IQ to least IQ descending order: - Niko - Chunkz - AJ - Sharky - Kenny
164? i would love to chat w her for hurs man. thats crazy you dont even see that alot. would really love some of her life stories and advice.
AJ is dumb 😂
I SCREAMED AT THE NAMES ABBY AND KANE, THE 100?
The fact that Einsteins IQ was around 160 and the first one was 164 is insane
Einstein had an IQ of 167 she has 164!
i love how much they violate rich the dick he littually answers everything im at 18:20 soo my guess is rich the dick is the smartest
9:57 hot
Why is no one talking about their rudeness towards the Rich guy whom they were constantly calling a d*ck. While he was handing his card to them, the person went to him to take the card but didn't and mocked him. I think these 5 must have been intimidated by his confidence.
Since I saw your guys yt channel everything in yt is better and fun
I know pi up to 100 digits
164?? That's considered a literal genius
Stupid questions.
My IQ was measured to be 186 utilizing the Cattell test in 1989. My school system in Southern New Jersey, USA sucked and I was incredibly bored. I spent a lot of time cutting class in the library. The backstory is that I got into trouble a lot when I moved there from a violent neighborhood in Boston. I was also abused at the daycare I went to. When I moved to New Jersey I was confronted with fake and petty children and I could see through them. You have learn how to read people in the city. I would punished students that I could tell were selfish, rude, sadistic or disrespectful. I actually broke a fellow students nose in the bathroom in first grade because he wrapped his arms around me from behind and I hit his face with the back of my head. I was kicked out and went to private schools that my mom couldn't afford because she left an abusive husband with three children many years prior. When she could no longer pay I had to go back to public school. She made me swear to avoid fighting at all costs. So, I went back and got punked a lot as I imagined head bunting people in the teeth and other hyper violent things. I wish that we never lived in that pretty looking cesspool/suburb. Because of that I am thinking that the tall guy, the guy with the beard or the older woman.
226 is right
I last took an IQ test when I was in 5th grade and was 128...would my IQ change being older now, or would it stay the same?
164 is Einstein level shit mannn
If it was mark... Who was the guy that they saw with drone...
Amazing ! Thank you !
Pretty sure Kenny's IQ is below 80.
Based on their inane babblng I'd say that the combined IQ of the entire pannel is less than that of any of the indiviuals they are judging😂
16:07 did he really told her?
Y’all be forgetting the 9 it’s 3.14159269
You need like a 60 iq to open a door. How can she have 70
I thought it was Danny the first
special needs school🤣
Nah the fact they didnt out jasmine last the second she didnt know how many letters there were in the alphabet i knew it was over bro
Chunkz you need a belt 😭😭 21:53
20:58 Niko and Chunkz wtf 😳😭
CHUNKZZZZZ 8:39 🙌🙌
What IQ test did they run? 164 IQ wouldn't be wasting their time on this
The guessers are coming across as disrespectful a**holes
The jury laugh every seconds. So annoying. Is their IQ 40 each? Or are they forced to play stupids.
164 my foot but she is likeable otherwise. Also 152 is lying too.
I don't believe these were actual test for the type of iq given
I do not believe this is the order at all lol 😂
I's love to have an IQ of 60 ! Live would be so much easier !
The series one is 225 it’s 15x15 The previous ones are  11x11= 121  12x12=144 13x13=169 14x14=196
I'd like to know what IQ test you gave them. If you just took a free one from the internet, it wasn't accurate. It's a little hard for me to believe you had someone with an IQ over 160 and one with an IQ over 150.
Iq test arent biased or trying to catch in twisting words. They are unfair with their questions
IQs below 90 are crazy. Not to be offensive, but chimps aren’t that far off.
Wish they'd link the quiz they gave them in the description I want to know where I'd rank
164 is absurd and i find that hard to believe, i was 146 last time i was tested. what you will notice, the higher the iq is the less well people tend to dress. i thought the old dirty white guy was going to be number one i only watched like 3 minutes of this couldn't stand the questioning. smart people think about everything that could go wrong dumb people are confident and happy. the three dumbest people are probably the most successful and happy.
i think i can be 3rd in here
"why do you need a comb you dont need one" got me dying
Doubtful she has 164. Most of these high-scoring pople got tested when they were a child and fail to reproduce extremely high scores as adults. She's probably still in the gifted range, though.
chunkz impression of niko had me dying😂
wHats jasmine @?
These guys asking the questions are idiots.
19:04 im dead the way aj sniffed chunkz lol
I am looking at 5 chimps isn't it?
stupid people ranking IQ
IQ tests really can’t give accurate designations over 140.   I’m also curious whether they really all took actual IQ tests and not online ones
Calling it: Abby doesn't have 160+ IQ.
I don't have any faith in the IQ test that they took. Getting two people randomly having 150+ IQ's and then having one be an amazon flex driver and the other an office worker is even lower odds. The girl having 70 would not be able to wipe her own arse without a carer. The average being 100 and we have 4 110+ and 2 well below. Extremely unlikely to get these randomly grouped together.
The fact that Einstein’s estimated iq was 160 and Abby has a higher iq than him is simply legit.
Anyone else from Canberra
these guys are right morons and super annoyimg.
160iq 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
70 is super low, I don't know if i believe that.
I.Q test don't mesure inteligence, it just mesure how good you can do the I.Q test.  The test was developed to help kids to improve your ability with math. Once that kids with lower grades could have better help from teachers, what means that after more classes those kids could improve yours I.Q test grades.  What means thar I.Q test are not defenitives, you can improve your grade studing, and if you took a test when was a kid, as a adult you will have a completely different result.
People with genius iqs seem to blend in socially; it's easier to spot the above-average iqs than the geniuses.
Guys were actually rude on this one
how many went to google or dictionary ...RETICENT ..... START WITH ME!
I was hoping to see them pull out the test to prove it.
I dont have an IQ, just the Q 😂
I got put ear peat to watch bada squad wallahi and I’m beginner American English
Okay, but why is someone with an IQ of 164 working in an office answering the phone?
Its haram to swear on something or someone other than ALLAH.
too bad the boys are too stupid to ask good questions
Question of knowledge are not how you mesure IQ
idiots guessing other people's IQ....
When you know abby 😂
The black boys at the table are probably the dumbest in the room.
I did something when I was young and apparently go 132 or 136 or something. I’m alright with puzzles and some quick thinking but I’m not a math person and I’m unmotivated.
24:15 I really believe niko is smart he wins so much challenges (or maybe it’s because he’s my favorite from the group but shhh)
18:27 bro capping
What woman with her belly button out has iq for GOD'S sake!!!
How are you measuring IQ? 164 is unheard of so Im really hesitant to believe this is a legitimate test. WAIS-IV is thestandard in the US
I feel the iq test was not accurate
Pi is 3.14159 for sure idk after that my memory 🙃
Them not even reacting to hearing 164 is horrifying. That's super genius lvl wth...even tho she sucks at naming the PI range...odd
These dudes didn't know pi but pretended they did.
At 12:50 there are 8 vertices in a cube, but it actually has 24 corners, 4 for each square face x 6 faces.
ranking IQ while counting the contestants from right to left, the irony
164 is lying. WTF. This percentage of IQ means fluently being able to do atleast 2 Tasks the Same time atleast 9/10. No Front, but she doesnt seem like that
Given that 100 is the average, even 119 and 125 are quite up there. I somehow don't believe that 70 something of Jasmine.
19:10 how does it smell AJ?
man there's so vague definition of "IQ score". If you just take a normal distribution the highest you can reach in those online test is 146. No idea how you able to measure IQ beyond that score. Basically if you answer every question correctly on a test like me it would tell your score is 146.
Those are awful questions.
Aint cobweb tattoo’s for spending time in jail????
IQ of "150" is already really really rare
164 is so freaking high... which test did they used? I might have missed it if they mentioned it.
I'm questioning the test's used for this. Four people out of a group of six being above the standard deviation of 'Average IQ' is statistically improbable.
omfg, dude watches stargate sg?!?!? Instant favorite!!
Knowing the beta squad’s real IQ and seeing how Abby ranked them is so funny 😂
would be so much fun to joing ya guys for just even one day >w<!
*That woman took me by surprise, I guessed her wrong. But I think she didn't care about the questions at all, she took them as a joke, to fool everyone.* That guy with the white beard also caught me until halfway through the video, at first i thought he has the lowest iq.
Some people don't understand that an IQ test should be taken in one take and with a professional. Also, IQ is a part of the human intelligence, but in no way it determine if you are successful or not in your life (I don't think some members of the beta squad are very smart themselves if I must say so), I find the name they chose for this video very condescending "ranking strangers from the smartest to the dumbest". Some people with high IQ can find themselves very dumb and not able to function correctly in society and also lack culture and emotional intelligence. They also were very condescending when asking question, they obviously had the answers on their phones and I'm sure the people in this video were probably uncomfortable (they kept calling rich by the wrong name, aka dick....)
Who chooses who here?
I love this channel usually. But damn was this cringy to watch. Felt extremely condescending  vibes coming from the "squad" and the contestants looked uncomfortable the whole time.
The questions don't test visuell abilities, but visuell abilities are a big part of the IQ-test. Like moving an object in three dimensions and knowing, wich objects are the same or having a picture of gears with only one arrow and knowing, wich gear goes in wich direction.
70 is just above the level of retardation. 164 is smarter than Einstein, this has a wide range of people
I feel like their scores have no validity.   Have they even done a REAL psychologically certified professional IQ test? It costs like 50+ Dollars so I guess they just took some shitty online tests for the Video and thats that.   Also because they are WAY to smart on Average to be just randomly picked people. 164 is like 1 in 10000 or something. And they all had ridiculous Numbers like that.   Online IQ tests are shit though and most shows like this use them.  I have quite a bit of Experience with IQ tests and I know how had the results of the Online tests are.  My actual official IQ is 131 (which I can already be very proud of though its nowhere near their Numbers) while the online tests placed me somehwere between 160 and 180 which is absolutely ridiculous and wrong on all levels.   So did they even do real IQ tests? I doubt.
holy shit! 164????? she's smart asf
Those IQ tests can’t be right. The probability of getting that many IQs that are so far from the average in one group is very low. Let’s say the BETA squad knew their IQ before hiring them for the show. That means they found two people with IQs in the top 0.002% (roughly) . Seems unlikely already. But that not even considering that less than 2% of the population has had a standardised IQ test and not considering they have to find someone with such gifted IQ that is in the market to be on YouTube. The sample pool to choose from is infinitely low. Let’s say the BETA squad tested their IQ before the show while not knowing their IQs beforehand. Then the chance two people have IQs of over 140 in a group of 5 is about 0.000004%.
How is she operating witb 70 iq what
Albert Einstines IQ was estimated to be around 160 the fact abby has an IQ of 164  is so immpressive hats off to Abby
17:21 "Hello model...come with me here"was the funniest thing I've ever heard 😂😂
Chunkz is the smartest
there questions had nothing to do with iq...iq is not related to data saved in memory its about how they forget the data and remebers the logic of retriving it
I just looked and a person must have an IQ below 70-75 to be diagnosed as having mental retardation.
164, total bullshit, 152 possible but hella unlikely abby bullshitting
You are my favorite Youtube channel by far
literally abby is smarter than albert einstein shes 164 and he was 160
I doubt that the model has an IQ of 70 if 100 is the mean and if 15 is the standarddeviation. Because when 100 is the mean and when 15 is the standarddeviation, then a test result of 70 to 79 is close to be mentally handicapped while a result below 70 is equivalent to be mentally handicapped. And I don't think the model was handicapped. Also the questions in this video were not all testing cognitive intelligence, but knowledge.
An absolute number alone means nothing, if you don't know the mean and the standarddeviation. I think of IQ as a test result (which can vary for the same person depending on if the person had a good day or a bad day) and I think of IQ as a percentage X meaning "A person with an IQ of X % has a better result than X % of all the people who took the test". This way you can summarize the test result of a person as one, single (relative) number.
164 is very rare. She is one in 31,560 people so is 151 with one in 1,300 or so.  The "dumb" girl is just like everybody being about 1 out of 4 people. Dumb girl is cool and has high emotional inteli would guess. The high I.Q. girl sited the fact she is a Hippie as proof of her intelligence. right on. fuck the system. do your own thing.
Idek what a good IQ is I’m 14 got a psychiatric evaluation and I have a 140 IQ but like does it change when u get older and is the scale of like good bad when ur not technically an adult 😭
Ok so u saying Abby got same iq as Albert Einstein.I mean that's crazy 😂
niko made a mistake when he asked jasmine her first question he said “how many words are in THE alphabet” not “the WORD alphabet” and he couldve said “how many words are in alphabet” but that wouldnt really make sense
how can i measure my iq
Did they take that IQ from a random internet test or was it an official test from Mensa?
rich's iq is -ve
The 5 morons are the ones sitting
Is it just me or does chunks switch between socks and no socks every 5 seconds
nikos questions are so out of pocket
all those riddles were so easy and stuff im so confused.. also why did she say yeah maybe if her IQ is 164 average is like 100 if hers is 64 more she is deffinitely smarter than the average person
She is not that smart she's pretending
8:41 chunkz vocals amaze me EVERY time
My IQ is 135 and I’m shocked because I honestly thought Abby was last. It just shows IQ really doesn’t have much effect on how you act. But what do I know I failed all my GCSEs
Albert einstein had an iq around 160 they dont seem to realize it.
Imagine yourself standing there and listening to a bunch of boys arguing about how smart or stupid you are
wow
"What does zygote mean" 😭😭😭
Neither of the two at the front have IQs anywhere near 152 or 164. Unless the test was administered by an actual psychologist or MENSA, it’s just based off some stupid online test that means nothing. The most common IQ test (WAIS V) doesn’t even test past 155, so these are definitely incorrect scores lol.
Niko smart
how he know about combs he dont need one was actually a violatino
Is it just me or y'all never get an ad before/in between beta squad videos!??💀
They don't realize how much 164 and 154 iq is.
I'm just bamboozled how someone with 164IQ can have problem with simple addition and substraction question.
Im more funnier than all of them especially Niko
Damn how humiliating is this and people are loving it
"There is actually 11 letter in the word "alphhabet" "
Nah, BS. That girl's IQ is not 70. She would basically be drooling.
Abby smarter than elon musk
Im 13 and got 143 IQ so according to the comments im pretty smart.
both of the girls and the guiy with the beard are going th esamrtest im calling it
kenny abd niko had the best so far
12:24 whaty.....
Well, I think it was one of those internet iq tests! I have a first in a Civil Engineering degree, and a distinction in a master’s degree for Structural Engineering. It means nothing.   I can say with confidence she does not have that reading of iq, nor did she demonstrate any problem solving skills, to which is where most of questions lie for an accurate iq test. Albert Einstein was between 160-190 for reference. I believe Stephen Hawking was a recorded 160 score. To put that into perspective.
Nah everyone was dumb.
Abby has more IQ than Albert Einstein
I knew the model girl was last. She stupid but thinks she’s smarter than average and she wouldn’t be doing modeling if her intellectual was good and had high iq cuz what kind of smart lady resorts to jobs that don’t require them to be smart and intellectual enough lol. So that was obvious.
im a psychologist  and im sure the tests were incorrect if that girl was 70 she would definatelly not be able to answer that fast  but if they are roughly reliable any one of top 4 outsmart the whole beta squad combined in raw capacity  people see digits and dont think how insanely fast people are with 10 points difference compared to the other participants  if this doesnt sound very clear i am trully sorry
They have so low IQ that they could not comprehend what does iq < 140 means … wtf !!!! I am blown away with 164!!!  How are they both still alive I heard super geniuses don’t live long because of their overclocked brain🤯🤯🤯🤯
Stargate SG-1 ❤ I love him!
My IQ is 145
i don't think this iq test is on par i mean i just took an iq test and i got 144 knowing damn well my ass ain't that smrat, and if so since abby has an iq of 164 she literally could've had any other job ex: theoretical physicist i mean she is literally on par with the worlds greatest physicist so I think this isn't a very good representation of ones iq.
Those IQ scores aren't real. They weren't measured properly.
as someone who is 125. This just made the Beta Squad look daft AF.
IQ never really identifies who is the smartest and who is the dumbest! 0:18
guess its true what they say weirdos are usually the smartest in the room
10:23 you lot just got tricked into allowing this man to say a slur at you
I am a coin collector too!
If Abby has an IQ of 164 how can she not do 26 + 13 + 5 - 9 in her head
I know that the guys are trying to make things funny, but it was a bit degrading....towards the contenders
For some reason i felt the people on the stage had more iq than the ppl qsking the questions who were playing among thems selves @MeatCanyon
This video shows that IQ values seem to not be the same as the Europeans lmao 'cause the 164 lady and the 150 guy will all due respect clearly showed that they're not that high on the ladder ngl
if she’s 164 i must be a once in a millenium genius
I think that this order should be the other way around, Niko and Aj should also switch places, then everything would be fine! haha😊
They should do an in test for.the guys at the table. 😅
that lady from the 1st place seems stupid af
Day 26 of asking you to visit Sarajevo
164!? shes smarter than steven hawking
Now let´s see Abby´s card
The second guy looks a lot like Hans and the crazy thing is that he actually plays the guitar.
does someone have jasmines insta or wtv?
They got Australia wrong 😭
These guys are idiots but I like watching them
They don't seem to realise how smart 164 IQ is. That's wild.. They don't seem to realise how smart 164 IQ is. That's wild..
What an embarrassing programme.
i just really love how they turn and hug each other while they're laughing
164 is little higher than einstein's was, i believe.
Man I have only watched the 1st minute, and to those people it must have seen like they are being judged by monkeys 🤣🤣🤣
I don't know my exact IQ but i'm 17 and i've only had friends older then me (minimum 23 years older) and well it's proven i got a minimum IQ of 130 but probably higher.  I really get annoyed when people base things off of feelings instead of facts.
The one with probably the lowest IQ she put first so like no
Well her ranking is stupid lol  The one she puts first is very judging etc. that's a massive sign of low IQ so like no this is just based on if she likes what the person said or not, not facts
I think the last one is one of the people with the highest IQ's since people with high iq's often are more autonomous and out standing, he also seems like he knows himself etc so yes and he has self spot  Smart people often think/know they are stupid because they know how much they don't know  Jasmin and Rich probably have an IQ at least higher then 120  High IQ people often are creative so yes   R: Still learning at an old age is quite hard for a normal person M: C: Most gifted people don't finish school and need a lot of help so well yes D: A: Gifted people suck on automation so it's actually a sign J:    Rich: 5 Mark: 4 Chain: 3 Danny: 2 he might be smarter but socially awkward that it doesn't come out Abby: 2 Jasmine 1  But as a gifted person it's not hard to tell you all aren't the smartest ones tho and to take it in offense since you all think you are but it's not that high  Like i knew all your well sneaky questions and shit and i'm actually gifted, but you all think you are smart as hell but you basically only show signs of low IQ lol  Also you didn't ask good questions to actually know someone's IQ, you should ask things like when did you first start to walk, did you come into puberty fast, did you felt like an outstander in class, did you like school, what things do you find interesting  I started with philosophy when i was just 1 or 2. I started learning about biology, science and history when i was 4 to 8 but mostly around the age of 6, i hated school etc. etc.
The way they treated Rich was really distasteful
lol these idiots dogging on Americans. i bet you the average American is smarter than their average
Antarctica is a real place
For some context, Only about 1 in 136,000 is as smart as Abby is😳
America is just one... there is no Noth and South continets.. just one America Continent which includes 3  subsections  :  North, Central, South.
Beta Squad asking trivia questions that are completely unrelated to intelligence was just dumb.
11:22 LOLLL
I dont have IQ just Q 😂
IQ clubs are scam, they just get your money. They even accept members based on your SAT score 😅 A real IQ test is okay, though.
15:31 lincoln is on thr penny
This made me feel a lot better about being a drama kid who did well in school and now does office work.
never confuse education with IQ.
people who do iq tests and believe in them are actually so dumb
around 160 was albert einstein's iq...
Fire drinking gasoline wasnt i supposed to die
I cant believe how rude the squad was, while not even funny
i think the order is  Niko Sharky Chunkz Kenny and AJ
Before they did the last move, I tried putting them in order and did a bad job of guessing. While Abbey was first, I do think going to and finishing college is not a good metric of who is "smarter". I think it is much more about determination and working hard in terms of college because it is not for everyone.
18:45 NIKO PULL YOUR PANTS UP
Lol the girl that they assumed was dumb was actually dumb. Lol ouch
6 guys with 164 iq combined try to find person with 164 iq
THE AMERICAN ACCENT AND HE UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION HAHAHAHAHAHAHA 😭 Australasia? never heard of that word 😭
beta squad IQ rankings (lowest to highest)- Kenny 83, Niko 92, AJ 96, Chunkz 121, Sharky 133
As an american i didnt like mocking americans, that wasnt cool made me feel ostracized... To be fair Ive mocked british accents before but now I know its not right.
19:26 💀
16:02 HELP AJ
AJ is rude
Aj saying “how do you need about combs you don’t need one” to Danny is CRAZYYY😂💀💀
Now they need to take an IQ test.
We got bruce willis and vin diesel on the same video
XD
Guys but these guys are literally dumb, how can they rank smart people 😭
As an American, I also heard baseball team
Australasia is wilddd
I need to take an iq test 😅
152 and is working as an Amazon driver.. i think he went through some Rough things in life
Bradley would have had the highest iq
You guys are the worst people to host a show. Annoying, rude, bullies. How do you guys have even views?
225
We all know Chunkz is the highest
no this is not the correct order hello did anyone listen to the question
Smarter than albert??
I think chunks is actually the smartest from beta squad
19:09 not aj smelling chunkz 🤣
1:07 AJ DID KENNY DIRTY YELP
I q
are you tell me that a person with 164iq , can do 26 plus 13 plus 5 - 9 in their head. i did it.
164 iq is amazing, that's like einstein level.
i think the judge panel should be up on the stage and i'm sure none of them will score more then the lowest iQ
19:08, why's AJ violating 😂😂
My friends name is jasmine too
Beta squad is just plain annoying
IN THE LAST PART I’D PUT   CHUNKZ SHARKY NIKO KENNY  AJ
bruh pi is 3.1415926 not 3.1415126 or whatever
freeman brothers... hmmm   (google it)
why did it cut off after aj starts to talk about the comb😂😂😂😂😂
A 164 IQ and working in customer support?  She should be building rocket ships lol
😂😂tt little discussion there with Sharky and chunks after rich got shagged by Aj
bro albert also had a cow tatto on his butt is he a fool?
There ain't no way abby has a IQ of 164 i  smarter then her and im 11
164?   thats einstein level
No black ppl I see how it is
When Chunkz asked Jasmine how many zeros in a billion and she answered "6". I was literally hollering when he said "Audhubillah"😂😅😅😅
I’m I the only one who noticed that at 15:40 those weren’t the actual digits of pi
whats jasmine's socials, shes so leng bro
poor rich
I lost brain cells watching that.

What my name is Danny
none are higher than me beans iq 😏
How am I smarter than a adult male from America! My IQ is 113 btw
I love how much fun these guys are having with it.
Which IQ test was used. Because most are very fake.
I am sorry kids, I take the 70 IQ girl everytime. Sorry. Too cute.
@14:35 it says, "What 'WAS' the US President name in 1990?" and not "what 'IS' the US president name in 1990?".  Therefore Danny's answer was a close one but technically the answer would be George H.W. Bush for the question of "What WAS..."  and the answer for "What IS..." would actually be JOe Biden.  LOL that part bothered me so I had to state it. But am I wrong!?!
How was this IQ measured!? 164 is exceptionally high, and no offence, but she did not seem this exceptionally gifted. I have a feeling they just took a random online test. This is very misleading.
Shakespeare did not die the same day he was born. The story, that he died the same day as he was born was made by people of the times as this gave his life itself a deeper meaning / purpose and added more 'flavour' to him as a person. Even today we adore stories and books starting and ending in the same way. It has smth magical to it.   In Shakespeare's case, this story gave more value to his projects as his name truly became a brand and made him more well known. All thanks to that sort of ending. Obviously it also made people (who sold his stuff or advertised for it) gain more money, too. In the end, even today, we still wonder if he truly wrote all of his plays. Many are confirmed, but others do not quite fit his style of writing. His true birth date is also unknown. I have read different articles... and they all state different dates, while also bringing up his alleged same death day. The death date is well recorded, but the birthday is unknown.   In the end Shakespear is shrouded in mystery to some degree and I prefer it stay that way, as this makes it way more fun to analyse and think about.
the panel is rude...but quite likeable!
My iq is 123 and I’m 12 lol
the trailers hit so much harder when is an old video, its force me to not stop watching videos. there is definitely a genius behind the decision of implement the trailers
so ur telling me abby has a higher IQ then albert einstein??
as a guy with an iq of 157, i can confirm that 164 is crazy smart, i mean, einstein was only 160.
That blue women ain't 164 lmfaoo hard cap
164 is CRAZY 130 and beyond is considered genius but 64!?!?!?
That was not the order it was the other way around
Danny's the cutest man ever
Ad 21:47
I can see nico and chunkz underwears
Yeh...The Judges are the Dumb ones!!...And the Silly whites on stage being Mocked?
THESE QYESTUINSS R PRETTY DARN EASY but so is my spelling
Every single person didn’t know pi it’s 3.14159 not 3,14567
An IQ between 70-85 is medically borderline retarded
7:19 was a MADNESS
“she’s here for vibes” 😂😂😂
Make this video again but next time give us a list of high i.q traits to back up your reasonings and for entertainment/learning.
16:11 aj gotta be the funniest in beta squad
They also don't seem to realize how smart 152 is either.  That is really close to Einstein's.
I think the beta squad from smartest to least is shaky, Niko, chunckz, Kenny then aj
next time do a similar episode ranking guys based on dick sizes, ...
They messed up the president question they should of said current president
minute 19:08 was crazy, not AJ blocking his nose after smelling chunz
164 iq is the iq of albert estintine
She doesnt have an iq of 164.. she lied, she cannot answer basic question and knowing the fact that the last girl didnt know her iq and said its 70(mentally retarded) it says that they didnt need to prove their iq’s and just said some high number
You’ve got to use people with high IQ to rank people’s IQ next time 😂
The guy who mentioned Stargate and has a tattoo in ancient. Ure the best
16:12 killed me LMaooo
why did aj sniff chunnks 19:10
Even 150 though
Danny is genius but life was harsh to him
Beta squad…..”EYE” could also be the correct answer
I think: Niko, Sharky, Chunks, Kenny and Aj
I feel like canny can tell us like a lot of things
abby is near eienstien
When Abby put the two with durags as the dumbest,  bias doesn’t go away with intelligence. It’s a whole other concept.
Was interested to see how sexism, ageism, and all together implicit bias will come into this. Of course lol..
Hmm with that 160+ iq, I don't trust that the test was a real one.
"I don't have IQ, just a Q."  Nice 🎤
dam jasmine. you cant be that cute but so dumb wtf!
7:23 bro why am I feeling bad for this guy he seems like he wanted to be something in life and turned out as a Amazon delivery driver
0:50 *them talking about cobwebs on the elbows not knowing what the tattoo represents😢
What test did they take?
What’s funny is jasmine has borderline mental instability and Abby is exceptionally gifted
pewnews music damn.
3:24 I KNEW SOMEONE WOULD SAY THAT
aj is suppose to be last
9mins chunkz pants are down😂
Guys, it's no wonder that IQ's differ on a world-wide basis... for instance, you have the highest IQ in South Korea and the lowest in Chad. It's no rocket science, just random facts of life

Using how much school someone went through is one of the worst ways to accurately determine someone's IQ. the less school you went through, the more intelligent you are. school teaches you what to think, not how to think. it doesn't teach you how to logically access, connect dots, discern information, rewiring the brain, individual thought, how to connect the subconcious mind to the consciou, how to develop skills and thousands of the most important skills in life. school education puts you far behind by teaching incorrect, useless information. school equals conditioning, not intelligence in any way, shape, or form and has quite obviously shown undeniable signs of being behind and deeply unevolved since as early as the 1800's. self education is where real intelligence lies, formal education equals conditioning and is immensely destructive, and takes you further away from reality, yourself and your truest nature.

I love Chunkz’s inferences and adlibs 😂👌🏽… always spot on 😂❤️
Nikos definitely the smartest
I liked how they literally changed freeman brothers to free the brothers😂😂
Kenny gotta be the new riddler for batman
I would just like to put out that Einsteins IQ was 145 and Arby’s is 164 🤓
Sorry but what does 2:1, 2:2, 2:3 mean?
I am a child, and I have a higher Iq than the model
164 is maddddd
hilarious lol
I've watched this so many times, it's practically my daily ritual!
164 IQ? nah I cant believe it.
My IQ is in the top 4% and in their range I'm around the center lol.
IQ isn't how smart you are, it's just how easily you can learn.
Also, the amount of letters in the alphabet changes depending on where in the world you are. In English speaking counties: 26 Here in Norway: 29
There are different interpretations of how many continents there are: 4 - Afro-Eurasia, America, Oceania, Antarctica 5 - Africa, Europe, Asia, America, Pacific 6 - Africa, Europe, Asia, America, Oceania, Antarctica 6 - Africa, Eurasia, North America, South America, Oceania, Antarctica 7 - Africa, Europe, Asia, North America, South America, Oceania, Antarctica
chunkz got vocals
I knew the first two the moment Danny said reticent and Abby said talkative
LMAO NOT SHARKY CHANGING INTO AN AMERICAN ACCENT😭😭 + IT WORKED
I think these guys (who are trying to judge) are kinda stupid bunch) , would be curious to know their IQ
2:27 "Cause Kenny's not the smartest" 💀😭
I’m right in the middle at 124 iq
Can anyone explain why envelope was the answer?
Who did these iq tests?? Because iqs below 100 is basically mentally challenged or mentally retarded, at least 70-80 range.
I tinkh sharky da smartest
Just to take in note a chimps IQ is 20-25 An orangutans is 75 and the smartest dinosaur the trooden had an IQ of 5.8!
Das
Man got the pi wrong
119 IS hyper intelligent
to me jazzmine seemed smartest and prettiest <3
These guys are pathetic.
Truly creepy looking blacks in the UK
Jasmine is gorgeous!
Yo when that dude said"eye" he wasn't wrong.. There is only one letter between the e's
12.08: What's full of holes, but can still hold liquid? Boreholes 😁
I had it all correct except i had Cain and Abby switched around. Cain was 1 and Abby 3 for me but i was surprised.
Chunks 115 Niko 110 Sharky 100 Kenny 85 Aj 75
that model is 90% my type :(
crazy
"Brother I couldn't care less" 🤣🤣
Yep, it's a fact, monkeys cant judge.
Yeah mine is 142 not so big
KENNY THOUGHT THE CAPITAL OF AUSTRALIA WAS RIO
THE AVERAGE IQ OF THE MORONS RANKING THE STRANGERS IS 75
How can she has 164 iq and the other girl 75 or something like that it s impossible. Monkeys has 70-95 iq. This means average monkey is smarter than model girl
6 dumbs are limbed up by 5 dumbs
Chunkz is definitely number 1 bruv
I am kind of sad about the cute girl. She probably didn't know she was not that bright, because everyone was just making compliments to her up till now.
Free the brothers! Gosh, they are so funny sometimes. Also, I both mean it.
nah, AJ should be number 7
Off course they don't know what recitent means. They've probably not even heard of the concept 'book'.
If Beta Squad actually took an IQ test i believe Chunks would be #1, Niko maybe #2
152 and 164 super smart. 125 is bad either
Why was I so proud that I could remember so many more digits of pi. 3.141592653589793236462643 (that’s all I can remember, someone fact check me fr)
Those judge looks so raciste.. omg
My IQ is 148, actually Mensa tested in Belfast, Northern Ireland — in English, while my native language is not English. But I'm single, mediocre job, don't own a car, don't have many friends. So it doesn't guarantee you will succeed in life. In fact I am plagued with anxieties, paranoia (mainly about getting fired) & insomnia (I can literally not stop thinking until I am dead tired), and sleep only 4 hours per night. I do always win in Trivia games, speak 4 languages (in which I can do business presentations, and even tutor those languages to the natives speakers), knew that the next number (@00:11:20 in the sequence 121, 144, 169, 196...) was 225 in less than 1 second, I was able to read at age 4, and able to calculate by heart in fractions (1/4 times 2/3 divided by 1/2 etc.) at age 5. I am certainly book smart, pick up a new skill (like programming, designing spread sheets in a few days) and can memorise things easily. Like I know all James Bond film titles in chronological order, and can name you all the 50 American States alphabetically, among other things. But as I said, it is not a guarantee for success.  My best mate has an IQ of 90 and has his own brewery, a wife and a kid.  A nice trivia for you: average IQ in any country is always 100. But the 100 IQ point is measurably different between countries. Anything between 85-115 is normal, most people are in that bracket. But for every person with an IQ of 150, there is a person with an IQ of 50. How it is calculated, in percentiles, it means 100 is the exact mathematical average. Saying an IQ of 105 is the average is like saying 5 degrees Celsius is the freezing/thawing point of fresh water.   People around 70 or lower are effectively less functional, but even that does not guarantee things. I have a neighbor, with an IQ of about 65, and she is happily married to a guy with a successful butcher shop, and 4 daughters. My own mom had an IQ of less than 75, but was a very astute primary school teacher. My dad has an IQ of over 140 and works as a truck driver (which does pay well, but demands normal cognitive skills, not genius level skills).
19:48 now that is a man of CULTURE, SG-1 is one of the greatest shows
already 119 is an extremely intelligent person
152 iq and works at amazon shes 164 working as a customer service waste of potenital honestly
Dude that was not Pi smh
iq higher than einstein and they acted like it was nothing...im dissapointed
When I was in Elementary School we were taught that there's 28 Alphabets, we include Enye and Ng in our Alphabet.
I mean i woudnt call anyone dumb but was funny
13:00 thats question he asked and he himself gave a stupid answer.
These dudes sound dumb yet judging people with high iq😂
These niggas ain't even paying attention, just laughing unnecessarily
Absolutely hated the hosts in this video
Rich is above average
I'm kinda confused how they thought Joe Biden was president in 1990
Danny and ‘she got a First’ are both less than 0.0013%
12:05 A woman
Crazy how william shakespeare born and died on same day like he wrote so many novels in one day😮😮
164 IQ is crazy, thats albert einstein level.
How did they measure 164? It's basically impossible to measure IQ reliably over 145, since there's no norm data for this group ( less than 0.5% of population).
bro the coin colector had enchantment tabel on his arm bro
Lowest IQ was found sitting behind the table
A bunch of Brown skinned men assessing a group of White people... video is Racist.
70? She didn't look mentally challenged... so their test must sucked.
my iq is 139 lol
einsteins iq was 160 hers is higher
164 iq but can do simple math💀
Bro 70 is almost impaired.
Having a "164" in IQ but cannot solve a first grader's math problem. You guys know the IQ tests on facebook don't count as actual IQ tests, right?
The video was amusing but I don't know where they got that IQ test. I don't care how much you can talk about personal preferences, no one with an IQ of 164 is going to reach the middle of their life with nothing but a bachelors in drama.
164 is absolutely insane
my iq is 126
Snigger was actually krazy 😂😂
Complete nonsense! Almost all standard IQ tests max out at 3x standard deviation, at least with adults. That makes a 145 IQ. I am saying that as someone who actually did a clinical test and maxed out at 145 in all subcategories. If you should find two individuals with an IQ > 150 in a random sample of 6, you should start playing lottery, or be very cautious over lightning strikes. It just does not happen. And Jasmine may not be a genius, but she is definitely not a mentally handicaped individual as should would be with an IQ of 70.
Bro rich and cian were prob the smartest no way she scored HIGHER THAN EINSTEIN  Bro all these IQ's are fake.
164 is just stupid
i am a very high IQ person myself i had 2 thoughts about like if she is playing dumb to make them choose that or maybe she is but i immediately knew when she faked that math question.
“Would you accept dick?” Is craaaazy
Number alone is not enough, you have to compare the standard deviation of the test.
The panel judging seem to have a sub IQ
Cobwebs on elbows are prison tattoos 😂
Some of the beta squad members are arseholes.
kenny wasn't lying, jasmine is leng
Abby can’t have 164 IQ because Einstein had around 160
There is no way that with 164 iq she couldn’t calculate 26+13+5-9 and wanted assistance.  Total cap I believe the old guy tho. Very good articulation and vocabulary making him exceptional there.
Nah genuinely when the guy thought he said “Baseball team” I was confused on how he heard that at first but when I hold my phone away from my ear and replay it, it does actually sound like he said baseball team lmao
Erm i feel i miss the joke about Joe biden, George H. W. Bush was presie  in 1990.
Someone get jasmines @ rn
IQ has a eugenic origin and is a fucking pseudoscience. This shit shouldn't have the acceptance that it has.
Eh, 12 min in and its so insulting to see these guys insult these people ...
Which method did they use? A random test online?
I thought anything below 80 was considered mentally retarded...
"Would you accept dick?"  😑 "i don't like that question"
11:01 - 11:16 LMAO
cringe
Put AJ on the end behind Chunkz and its all accurate
164 is insane higher than Einstein’s 160
164… wow. I have a high IQ and I find life to be utterly difficult, so I wonder how she finds it, with he’s being 12 higher than mine.
Superman and Stargate tattoos?! Hell yeah!
Having 70 IQ qualifies for mental retardation. That's wild.
bruh I wished they had revealed their own IQ's to see if Abby was correct:/
This just makes the beta squad look low IQ
She's duking 70 its as octopus
To have two people above 140 is crazy let alone a 163
7:17🤣🤣 i die bro how he look
i didnt realize it was so hard to notice such a damn high iq, but if thats the case there are so many dumb people as well for the avrg to be 100
The guy who said reticent means I'm not revealing ones thoughts or feelings haven't even watched the full thing my guess is he is in the top 2 highest.
last  is 70 something, 2nd is 152 &  first 164. I doubt these scores from legit IQ tests. 70 is 2 standard deviations from average. 140+ is genius. 152 IQ, & is a delivery drive?. 164 & works in customer service. Von Neumann better watch out for those 2.
They dont realise 164 IQ is wild bc theyre IQ is maybe 50😅😂
In Greece cobwebs on the elbow and knees is not a fashion thing...all I will say is don't assume someone with this tattoo is dumb..
I guarantee you that was not a legitimate test 😂
in order to speculate on who's the smartest, you have to be smart enough yourself to ask good questions. these don't qualify.
This shows that iq is meaningless
sheesh
S T U P I D
What y’all got against America 🇺🇸 ??
tbh, iq doen t really mean who s smarter
Abby and Danny are very smart people but no geniuses. Dont know why people throw the word so casually out there. I went to pretty good schools and have never seen a genius level anywhere near me. The gifted shine effortlessly remember that.
there is no way in hell these IQ scores are anything but wildly inaccurate.
According to ChatGPT 3.5:  IQ scores are typically categorized into various ranges to help interpret an individual's cognitive abilities. These categories can vary depending on the specific IQ test and the organization using them, but here are some common categories:  Mental Retardation (Intellectual Disability): IQ below 70-75 (approximately) This category is often subdivided into different levels of intellectual disability, including mild, moderate, severe, and profound.  Borderline Intellectual Functioning (BIF): IQ range of 70-85 (approximately) Individuals in this range may have some difficulties with cognitive tasks but often function reasonably well in daily life.  Below Average: IQ range of 86-99 (approximately) Individuals in this range may have average to below-average cognitive abilities.  Average: IQ range of 100-115 (approximately) This is the average range, where most people's IQ scores fall.  Above Average: IQ range of 116-130 (approximately) Individuals in this range are often considered to have above-average cognitive abilities. Gifted:  IQ above 130 (approximately) Gifted individuals are considered to have exceptionally high cognitive abilities.  It's important to note that these categories are not universally agreed upon, and different IQ tests and institutions may use slightly different ranges or terminology. Additionally, IQ scores are just one measure of cognitive abilities and should be interpreted alongside other factors when assessing an individual's capabilities. Furthermore, the interpretation of IQ scores can vary depending on the purpose of the assessment, such as clinical diagnosis, educational placement, or employment screening.
Theres no way Abby has 164 IQ thats just means the test is BS
monkeys
70 made me flinch
way too many ads
They acc had some1 from jail here. The spider web tatoo is the amount of years u have spent in jail
it felt like they turned danny into a joke and hes just a sweet old guy☹️
who measured their IQ? how a person with the highest IQ didnt solve an equation which even i solved in my mind ( the answer was 35) as well as goes on to say she is bad at percentages. very odd
rrroooooooooo
The IQ test is a terrible test, nobody really cares about it anymore
24:16 yes i agree with Abby
The title is very inappropriate; pure clickbait for a dim-witted audience. There's no reason to use the word "dumbest". Not ok...
In my opinion its  1. Niko 2. Chunks 3. Sharky 4. Aj 5. Kenny Edit: this is mainly based off of series they've done like Mafia and Going Back to School which need a lot of strategy and IQ
How do you know about combs you have no hair😅😢
so the model sterotype is kinda true here atleast lmao
in philippines our alphabet is 28, so i woulda said same no. as the model xD
american guys voice is amazing
My IQ is 167. I don’t know how it is to live with an average or lower IQ, but to me 167 can be a little tough. Jasmine’s IQ is surprising, I’d love to talk with someone like her to see how she sees the world.
abby jasmine danny kane mark rich
If they are saying it by the online tests , I mean , it's not right most of the times but if it's something else like they were actually being tested, fair enough
"freeman brothers" "FrEe tHe bROtHerS"
No one noticing how cain wasn't even right about the "167" in pi? In class I was always taught 3.14159.
This is so funny yk
70 iq is actually very low. A person with such intelligence would find problems just doing simple tasks and finding his way on the streets. This girl clearly doesn't look like someone with 70 iq, which indicates that most probably the tests that those people took were flawed. Anyways, the questions that were asked can't indicate anyone's intelligence, they are completely useless (apart from one of the questions, but it needs to be asked in a completely different environment).
I’m glad chunkz didn’t press them more on how far their education is. Seemed like a sensitive question for some of them
I think chunkz is the smartest cuz he think about the thing before answering it
at 11:25 the number sequence answer is 225, it just says 13 and thats wrong unless ive missed something
I don't think these commenters understand that IQ literally doesn't make you smarter at everything than someone. Stop comparing Albert Einstein to Abby. Like she would have to study in that field to even come close to Einstein. You people give me headaches.
Niko is the smartest
you could add up the combined I.Q.s of the judges and they would still come in seventh place.
AJ is the smartest rabbit I've ever seen
Chunks is the smartest ez
"what the hell are you doing in beta squad" LMFAOOO
15:00 Oil would make more fire
I love how childish and dumb the Beta squad are behaving hahaha. Just a group of normal dudes having some fun - in a dumb way.
Is it ranked smartest to dumbest or highest IQ to lowest IQ?
10:58
they are kinda mean
I could tell jasmine wasn’t that high of an iq just from when they moved her back to 6th she said, “I could be pretending.” Like she was trying to save herself. And whenever she moved up or down her expression was either embarrassed or happy. But when it comes to looks, she’s definitely the top.
A problem a lot of people with High IQ faces is that they "know they're smart" but they usually somehow still feel dumb a lot of the time, especially when they aren't as effortlessly successful as you would expect a smart person to be.
My IQ is like 126 😭
Did they all take the same IQ test before doing this? Because as far as I can tell they didn't and just said what IQ they think they are or may have gotten on some random online test. 70 and below is literally mentally disabled and she is clearly not.
Shlawg didn‘t recite pi correctly btw
Freeman brothers
Making 👏fun 👏of 👏people👏 is👏 not👏 funny 👏
As the finale question, beta squad could ask "whats your IQ?"
i call bs
I love how Niko and Chunkz whole asses we’re out when they turned around.😭
8:40 the way they were gassing Niko had me crying 😂😂😂  adorable
Combine last two and it even not close to the girl in top
why are they being so aggressively rude to rich
i am 14 years old i have iq124
A fool thinks himself to be wise, but a wise man knows himself to be a fool.    -William Shakespeare
If they really got above 150 plus iq they wouldve talked in a different way the way smart people talk
NEW VIDEO  GUESS THE SPOILED KID
80 iq is damn low
Tbh I think the order of betasquad should be chunkz, niko, sharky, aj and Kenny are equal
i find it insane how people with high iq almost always end up unsuccessful
imo   1. chunkz 2. niko 3. aj 4. sharky 5. kenny  no disrespect, all of them are my favourite i love the banters.
I don’t think she has an IQ of 164- coin man was way better.  Knowing these fools
The way that sharky had to say the word in an accent is mental 😂
North America south America Africa eruop asia Australia and Antarctica im 14
online iq tests aint accurate (164) 🤣
The spectrum on that stage is crazy. From being far below average to ranging to classified geniuses who qualify for Mensa is absolutely insane.
i think they wanted to put the 2 women last but they didnt want to look sexist, ik i would😂
I have an iq and I’m nowhere close to being a genius, I don’t think it’s the best indication of intelligence personally.
1. Chunks, 2. Niko, 3. Sharky, 4. AJ, 5. Kenny 😊
“Australisa” uhm come on your a teacher it’s australia
10:34 LMFAO
Idk just the way Danny said reticent, it reminded me of my genius friend. So that’s my guess, plus I feel like socially awkward people are generally smarter.  Edit- dang didn’t see Abby coming at all
fallin in love wit a random girl in a beta squad video
Danny looks like he speed runs crossword puzzles and wins easily at Scrabble
i am pretty sure the iq's fake. i thought of myself as dumb but these people are dumb as hell
Jasmine have insta?
Cackling throughout the whole video
Starting from Rich and then on, those IQs are acryually high
i am not really happy of how you use muslim words as a joke like wallah wallahi selam alejkum i am not trying to be mean i love yall but i dont think that its like really respect to muslims
I think hihgest is kenny then chunkz then sharky then nico and last AJ
I feel bad for the girl with 70 iq
Iam 106 IQ and iam 13 iadk if iam a genius or normal or stupid or smart can u tell me
I got one that rhymes with trigger  Ni--- ( NOT TRYING TO BE RACIST )
11:47 😂😂😂😂
He was wrong about some values of pi
For Bunch of SNYGAS , not bad
This is a kind of a video when stupid people try to judge IQ.... LMAO damn, and they don't even get the Irony..... Can't get any better.
judges combined IQ 90
My iq points dropped while hearing yalls questions
An IQ test in not a good way to study smartness
Wow, the one in the 70s and the one with 88 seem so normal.  I would have never known it was so low.
It's possible that the top 2 are actually 152 and 164 but it's highly unlikely. Stephen Hawking was 160 and Jordan Peterson is around 150.
If you added the IQ of all the judges it would still be less than the lowest IQ contestant.
"Reticent" was actually a really witty response. Respect to that guy.
I find it hard to believe that someone with 164 IQ can be this sociable.
The Pi was wrong lmao its 3.1415926
The little singing riff thing at 8:40 was amazing😂
Im 16 and my iq is 131
Some of these riddles have multiple answers, like  "What has keys but open no doors" - Keyboard "What has teeth but cant eat" - Saw, Zipper....
11:22 the guy said 13? he gave a list of prime numbers, shouldnt the answer be 225?
Anyone got the models @? 👀
So how did hte IQ result end up being? We need an update!!
Hhfhgy
why does rich look like Donald Trump when he talks
If I had a IQ of 164 I wouldn't be on such stupid videos
LMAO WHEN SHARKY SAID BETA SQUAD IN AN AMERICAN ACCENT
So one of my professors who had 2 doctorates (chemistry and biology)  said his IQ score was 67 and as far as he was concerned that was his IQ.  The numbers only mean so much.
video?
nah i'd put jasmine first out of pure 'she's leng'
Abby favoured the lightskin in Niko for the lineup 😂
Rich is a smitty.
Yo I need Jasmine’s number she kinda…
Personally I’d say that In the beta squad Chunkz ,Niko,Sharky.Aj,Kenny in terms of intelligent
He got pi wrong
Niko is so cute
why are you all so disrespectful? also don't talk over each other , worst production I've ever seen
Nahh ma man chunkz got the highest IQ
i memorized 50 digits of pi  💀
3.14159.
Danny 152 delivering Amazon packages and Abby with 164 doing customer service... that's ridiculous to believe and they have no idea
no chance any of them have IQ higher than 120...
love how chunkz randomly speaks somali
niko is wrong it's 1 plus 1 is 2 but one plus one EQUALS 2 so niko is wrong
the iq of these people are kinda high but ok
You lot saying freedom bruddas I like that, made me laugh 🤣
1) Chunkz/Niko 2) Niko/Chunkz 3) Sharky 4) AJ 5) Kenny
Albert  Einstein's iq was literally around 160 , while these guys have a contestant who has the iq of 164.
Hopefully this gets to the top: @jasminetimms._
164, 152 wow
16:12
Low IQ's selecting other lows, what a joke. 150? that is just normal.
15.52 it is 3.14159265...
niko thedword  alphabet  has 8 letters not 11 man
Half of the questions have nothing to do with your IQ.
shouldnt be the other way around??? white raking on blacks hahaha
All the way of the show i think Jasmine is like smart person but at the end i was a little bit of dissapointed but still funny to watch that kind of stuff
judging by the girl getting a "70 something", the test has got to be bullshit. it's whatever, this video is just for laughs but 70 would put her at a significant disadvantage in her everyday life. mark was pretty quick and though he gave pretty stupid answers, i doubt his relatively low score as well.
The way she answered and was unable to answer some important questions isn't something a person with 164 iq level has....164 iq level people are highly intelligent, no offence, but she aint even know the value of pi and couldn't add and subtract those simple numbers  The iq test wasn't proper id say...i dont think yll realise 150+ is an insane iq and they wouldn't have problem solving normal maths sum or telling the value of pi
Anyone know jasmines @?
Good thing you didn't have any browns or blacks competing against them lmaoooo
Australasia and the americans😂
HAHAHAHAHHA KENNY IS SO VIOLATED
Snigger my gigers 😂😂, Americans..
Why are they saying pi like that 3.141567 wtf
Bro she has more IQ than albert einstein
you are muslim 😮❤ i now started watching your channel
Did you show an actual business card from Rich?  Because I couldn’t find him due to the provided information (abroad)….
12:30 Oceana Asia North America South America Africa Antarctica Europe its easy
They are too stupid to understand how smart 164 IQ is
They are too stupid to understand how smart 164 IQ is
have a little more respect
Jasmine is smash
You asked for an Albert, here I am! Also, I’m the only person in my family to have graduated from university 🧠
I honestly think Chunkz knows that he’s the smartest in the group
what are the values of pie 3.141 bro its 3.142
19:08watch aj😂
Dumb people themselves should not be judge of such task.
petition to remove AJ from the crew, rude, disrespectful, obnoxious, irritating and plain stupid
The trivia questions make me think these guys took a crappy online test
Is this self-reported? If so, kinda unreliable. If they set them a test, if it  was legit they would have to have selected one that could differentiate  the 140s from the 160s and not just the usual 70 to 130 type scale
Not gonna lie whatever test they used I'm getting a 200
I got all those riddles...I love riddles ❤
She’s not 164 iq I doubt it
Please dont use Lord Jesus as an expression. He is the son of God and He saved our lives. We shall not disrespect Him by using Him as an expression.
I’m the smartest I got 100 million power on rise of kingdoms
Wtf did AJ smell 😂😂😂19:08
niko saying that he is smarter than the average person yet he can’t spell quiche😭
8:41 no auto tune needed
I don't believe any of these IQ values for a second. I'm sure the order is more or less correct, but there's no chance they all took supervised IQ tests that came up with these results. 70 is just as unbelievable as 164.
8:38 wtf? Why everyone sleeping on those vocals
I bet the N word is just flowing through they brain
Whats jasmine ig?
Bro said lil mabu lyrics
jasmines @?
Y’know if someone has cobwebs on their elbows then it shows how long they’ve been in jail.
bro no shot they actually 160 iq and still dont know more than 5 digits of pi 💀
Bro top 2 and 1 are literal geniuses that should be like on tv more and like oh the only word i can say for that is "Albert" lmao
I think the order from highest to lowest is Niko, Chunks, Sharky, Kenny, AJ
It's always the pretty girls that are dumb 😂
Answer to the thing was 35.
anyone notice that pi was wrong its 3.14159 ect
"How do you know about combs, you don't need one" 💀💀
The answers for the pi question were wrong
19:08 how did everyone miss that 😭💀
dummies rating iqs
Btw 164 IQ is 99.99901 percentile and 152 is 99.97365 percentile.  They are both absolutely insanely smart (if IQ means anything).  And 79 is 8.1 percentile, ouch.
Look at me, I'm the captain now.
How do you know about combs he Don’t need one 💀
This taught me iq don't really matter
There is 28 letters in the alphabet in some cultures
Australaisians is wild
152 and 164 is so high
How can 5 idiots figure out how smart is somebody? This is one of the dumBest video i've seen in a while, congrats!
I think the order is Chunkz, Niko, Sharky, Kenny ,AJ
Keep talking about America we might have too fuck y’all up again for the second beat down 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
the accent here was to funny 11:10 😂😂😂
What a waste of productivity, a 164 IQ person working in customer service. Such a shame.
They are all so sweet and smart. Does anyone know where we can find jasmine btw ? 😂
"below 70-75, i.e. significantly below average. If a person scores below 70 on a properly administered and scored I.Q. test, he or she is in the bottom 2 percent of the American population and meets the first condition necessary to be defined as having mental retardation"
Why does there have to be an ad before the best part bro.💀💀
value of pi was just wrong
My guess off the bat is the bottom 5 are the ones at the table
So no one else noticed that the pi was wrong? It is 3.14159, not 3.14156
snigger
Everyone in thst room id so stupid, thats why u shouldnt idolize youtubers
This made me search smth up. I searched the average IQ of an 11 yr old. It said 30-60. My iq is 112-120 but idk if the average part is correct. But from this info I'm gifted-? (Some1 pls tell me if I'm wrong)
8:23 sharky 😂
The elbow cobweb tattoos means that person as served jailtime, and he has 2 so.. 😅
bro i love danny 😢 does he have socials??
21:12 to 21:49 was crazy
Beta squad is  Smartest - chunks                   - niko                  -sharky                   - AJ Dumbest  -Kenny
Hear me out... kane is kinda🤭 id let him hit
I love how they put subtitlessss
Can we just say that the cobweb tattoo on the elbow is supposed to represent the fact you have served jail time
I personally think this challenge was unfair. you gave Danny such easy questions but gave others such harder questions, like wtf?
She doesn't seem to be someone of that high of intellect
Chunkz is the smartest fs
Optimistic is one word you dingus 🤣
einstein iq was 160 abby is 164
bro 70 is mild mental retardation i’m just saying…
100 is the mean. 15 is one sd. +2sd is genius!
which number logically follows it would be 215, am i wrong? look at the relationship between the numbers.
This is painful to watch.  These guys don't have a scooby
Bruh y’all gotta respect your elders.. not that I am but honestly though I find the laughs and criticism in front of those people kind of disrespectful. But oh well its just a show.
i doubted the validity of the test as soon as abby said her score (having such an iq to work at a call centre is just not realistic) but then when the model said hers, it confirmed what i thought. 70 iq makes you technically a non functioning member of society, she seemed to interact normally and has a job, to be 70 you have to have a disability- so yh :(
Originally I didnt believe her iq was 164 but I did when she put Niko at number one
Drop the IQ test link so we can all see how we compare 😂
Austri-laser got me of guard 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i got the first 3 righttttttt
Where Jasmin's @?
The first 6 digits of pi is 3.141592 not 3.145167
Swap Aj and snarky and I think it would be accurate
Finally we saw someone whos shorter then Aj
they are too wound up about Albert Einstein yet do not realise the gal had an iq as much as him if not more
im calling cap. top 2 were definetely above average, but certainly not super genius level.
Whos the model?
Nah Niko so funny man
16:01 how do you know abt combs you don't need them💀💀💀
Im only 12 but i could be here and do well
She literally has a higher iq than Albert Einstein
No way you had 2 people with an IQ nearing Einstein's level lmao that's BS
Rick is in Luther the fallen son at 1:48:30 but he said he is a dj
164 and 152 iq sounds fake
Je vais le dire clairement, s'il copie directement la cover d'une autre chaîne, il devrait la crédit au moins dans la description
No way she has an iq above Albert Einstein
real qn is what is jasmines @
what if the fire drinks fuel
chunks niko sharky aj kenny
Wow the top two. Mine is 125, anyone else? 😅
Rich sounds like Elon musk ❤
I think you should do a part two
Chunkz' name is Amin?
It seems as though they were all given a brief IQ test on an app or a random number and told to play along to match that IQ. If I were to guess, Mark has the highest IQ in the room by far.
164 IQ means only 0.001% of the general population gets higher IQ scores than Abby. That's 1 in every 100,000 people.......
8:39 y was that “yeah” so good
I don’t get how she can have a higher iq than Albert Einstein and not be able to do a simple addition problem. IQ might be flawed after all
With Abby's guess on the Beta Squad IQ, I agree on where she placed Niko
”Why do you know about combs, you don’t need them”
Bruw aj needs to be lasttt💀💀💀
If American guy took out the S out of “Snigger” 💀💀💀
Wait… how are there two people with double digit IQ sitting there.  Is it really that common?  Unreal
Albert Einstein's 160💀
No way a 164 iQ can’t do simple math 🤦‍♂️
When the American said that's what I would do if I was you was clever insult just calling them dumb 😂
Bro how is the riddler not ranked 1st??
niko then chunkz then aj then kenny then sharky sory
i think abbys iq rank of the beta squad is accurate tbh
The answer that the world has 5 continents is not wrong… 5 and 7 are both correct answers
you guys are unbelievable disrespectful
Universty 41???
Anything over 140 IQ is genius, so Danny and Abbey are actual geniuses.
nah bruhh this was wild 😭😭😭😭16:13
Tbh the alphabet one wasn’t too obvious
i need jasmines @🙏🏽
Fude these guys are ruthless 💀
the high iq society is 130+ so 164 is wildddd
164 is more than stephen hawking
These mfs took the fake ass online IQ tests 😭 If any of y’all think they scored that high after hearing their answers then ur delusional
164iq and she couldnt calculate 2 digit arithmetic numbers? Sus
i was so shocked at 164 woah
152 & 164 the heck 😭
Einstein's IQ is only around 160 does that mean she's smarter than Albert?
The correct awnser to the re-arangement is to ask a stupid person to do it, so you dont have to bother with feelings and be an asshole
8:13 shakespeare was actually not born and dead the same day it is not confirmed but ppl morely wish it was the same day
Niko’s most underrated line 6:23
Who else here is a Stargate fan? 😁
Niko and chunkz be having their underwear on the floor 😂
Jasmine fuego tho so it’s fine 🤷‍♂️
They asked the dumbest questions to determine the order  Like riddles won't help much And judging people based on if they have memorised pi is stupid
“ how do you know about combs, you don’t need one” don’t my man dirty 😂😂
sharky’s translation 😭
6:38 FREE THE BROTHERS IYKYK
Chunks should be first
She’s not fucking 164 IQ Bros Einstein on steroids
nah they got an iq test from wish. no way the model was 70 and the office worker was 164 💀💀
"I'm dumb and I've got money"   cold.
Icl im thinking these ‘iq tests’ they took werent all that good. Because the probability of 1 person having an iq of 125 is 5% and the probability of a 150 is 0.02% and the probability of a 165 is 0.008% so the likelihood of having 3 of them in a room of randoms is 1 in 800,000. Keep in mind i just multiplied in my head and its 4 in the morning but these tests mean jack shit tbh😂
I don’t really pay attention to it but my whole family got tested and I was second to my dad who has 152 with mine being 147 I never actually knew if it was good or not till I did research I’m literally 3 points away from being a legal genius
Are we not gonna talk about chunkz singing like on point
“How you know about combs you, don’t need one”says to the bald guy💀💀💀💀💀💀
Can’t like but capital city of Australia is Sydney
I guarantee they done some bogus tests and furthermore iq has no real value merit is the only thing with substance grades achievements qualifications ect
yeah I’m seeing all these nincompoop brained people commenting like she’s a genius but if she were compared to the lower iq individuals say Albert Einstein they would all agree Einstein is the actual genius not this phoney who is apparently more quote intelligent than Einstein according to a number and test which you can practice to get a higher score
How can her IQ be 70? It falls under mental retardation, it's certainly not an average score.
So, einstein had an iq of 160 However that iq is just compared to the average person. Now the world is smarter, so 164 is absolutely mind blowing.  Rich at 119 is great.
16:11 💀
24:09 like the good old time
Aint no way AJ being placed that high.
I doubt they used legit IQ tests cause 164 is only 0.03% of population. 152 is 0.2%. And 70 IQ is basically mentally impaired.
1: Abby 2: Kane 3: Danny 4: Rich 5: Mark 6: Jasmine  My guess
What’s even crazier is 164 might actually be smarter because the tests literally don’t go higher than that
I have to say the IQ tests are usually bullshit, in year 7 got made do some tests and the nerves got the better of me scored 86. However, through secondary school I was always in top sets and intermediate sets. Got 100% for several science gcse exams, last IQ test I did years ago I got 186. So, Jasmine don't worry the tests are usually b.s as they historically do not take into account how people learn. Some are kinesthetic learners, some are auditory, some are mix of audio-kinesethic etc (I have taught people and train people at work). Lessons are typically taught by facing forward, listening to a lecture and a chalk board (the digital whiteboard is no different lol)  - this for kinesthetic learners is mind numbingly dull as it doesn't engage their mind in way that a design & technology class would therefore they get classed as in having ADHD.
People are talking a lot about Abby’s IQ and whilst it’s probably high, it won’t be 164 and here’s why:  - 164 is exceptionally gifted and makes you an incredible judge of others intelligence. She picked AJ to be second because he said she had a first in Drama. Now don’t get me wrong, getting a first at university is great and hard work, but it is exactly that, hard work, and nothing more. You do not need to be gifted to get a first, just time (this can somewhat be bypassed if your degree is math/science/engineering where to understand everything you may need a higher IQ just to comprehend the concepts). A lot of people will agree with this, especially a lot of people who went to Uni and got firsts, so for somebody to say she must be at the top or near the top for getting a first in an arts subject means they don’t really understand university and think everyone is smart who gets a first, which is a lot of people, kind of showing that he is one of the dumber ones if he respects that many hundreds of thousands of people who got firsts. Also, an arts degree usually gets judged by how well you can either produce the art or explain the art that has already been created, usually through a lot of experience and learning about techniques, not really problem solving. So for her to think somebody is smart based off them saying a first implies intelligence is kind of stupid. It’s quite backwards if you think about it, a lot of people who don’t attend university think a first is really hard to get and requires intelligence, and a lot of people who don’t attend university usually choose not to because they don’t think they’re smart enough (fair play to those who do but have their own passions or visions). In a roundabout way, she’s putting the lower IQ people towards the top for putting her on a pedestal. I don’t think a super genius would do that.  To address some other points, yes she failed pi and math because she was lying and hiding her intelligence, last question she focuses on the above avg part of the question to make people feel like she’s only just smarter than 50% = 110IQ, but also answering the question truthfully.   Also yes IQ doesn’t mean money or success, in fact it almost never does, the smartest people on this planet don’t make money, they make our future and our knowledge of the universe that bit brighter. So yes guys if you feel insecure that you’re below avg intelligence or didn’t go to Uni, like myself, then we can still earn the moolar.  Hope you enjoyed the read.
education doesnt mean shit
im a model   low iq  edit: LOL I FUCKING KNEW IT
I have over 100iq and im litteraly 12.
THAT AD ON THE 321 so dirty
someone gotta bring us  jasmine @ plssss
isn't Sydney ????????
No fuckjng shot someone with a 164 iq is answering calls doing basic customer service and danny too 154 doing delivery fucking crazy
164 is higher then albert Einstein's with the iq of 160 that is crazy
Whats jasmines @
I think the guys asking the questions are the dumbest.
IQ doesnt really reflex how smart someone is but it is still bit relevant it more tests the way how u can do tests and how good u would be in office work etc.
I new it was 35 before was ven born😂
gotta love danny
Chunks literally said Albert Einsteins brother to no 3😂😂😂😂
The guy recordingblooks like Kim Jong no offense
Smartest🤓 Chunkz Niko Sharky Kenny  AJ  Dumbest  👍😊😜
he said pi wrong. its 3,14159 instead of 9 he said 1 again
Albert instunes Iq is 160
bigger, tigger (the tiger), digger, snigger...nope cant do it lmao
Are we going to notice that aj sniffed chance 😂
they didnt realise they got a skinhead there xD
16:29 that's not true we dont know when he was born
“Would you accept d*ck” 🤣🤣🤣
This video makes me not want to brag about my 138 IQ... I thought I was smart. Lol
10:46 he was correct tho! And eye only has 1 letter in between the Es
That SG-1 ancient language tattoo was sick!!
These guys are so insulting they have to turn it down a notch 😂
That sorry dawg had me dying
"Free the brothers" IQ= __
That was fun haha
This used to be funny and good now it’s lame and not funny at all just all around rude asf now
I knew the redhead was smart. She has red hair and she looks like a teacher
LMAOO HOW AS SOON AS SHARKY SPOKE IN AN AMERICAN ACCENT THE GUY UNDERSTOOD 11:10 😭
1:03 Kenny looks like hes lost weight...🤔
Omg. I thought Rich was just cocky but 119 is actually pretty high. That's already above average by a lot
thats good
22:18 sharks is in love xD
The one that rhymes with trigger got me
I got a 30 second ad right before the big reveal 🥲
I mean, IQ is just creativity if I am correct. So, not really a flex. Personally, my IQ is 120.
10:09
Bro I only got I from iq
https://youtu.be/S7xEyomBBn😢😢😢
Ow😂
To give a comparison albert einstein had an iq of around 160, I do believe the iq (the number) the people they had is obviously off from their real iq.
Abby has more IQ then Albert Einstein hade😂
This is actually very offensive-
wats ur iq if u know
im 9 i did a couple iq tests and my iq is about 131
155 and 160+?? No way that is possible. Above 140 is already extremely rare. No way bro that test was good.
we must protect danny at all costs
Jasmine @ anyone?
Above 115 means better than 85% of the world and above 130 is 98%. Same the other way below 85 is 15% and below 70 is 2%. So we have some of the smartest and some of the dumbest people on earth in this show, or the IQ test was just some garbage from the internet.
I’d still date 70 IQ girl
😂😂😂 9:11
6:49 sexy job aswell
Even A pretty name 4:56
4:07 she sounds pretty aswell
0:57 he’s right
all 5 of them would be below everyone on the stage
I doubt Abbys IQ test score
Iq doesn’t mean you’re smart, just means you have an exceptional ability to become smart if utilized
Dude so the girl with 70 isn’t sure of the exact number but 164 is clear? Yeah seems like they took different tests. And what legitimate test tests to 164?
I just want to know who vocalized "Yyyeeeeeeeaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!" cause lol nvm it was Chunkz HAHAHAHAHAHA
how do you know bout combs.. u dont need one😂
Don't compare different age people because iq is different every age
Rich is a whole vibe lmaoo
My guess 13 minutes and 38 second's in:  1. Abby 2. american 3. einstien's brother 4. Rich 5. Coin collector 6. Model
Idiot test? You ask questions that has nothing to do with IQ. IQ is measured by stuff EVERYONE knows. You ask questions that require memorizing and recall function of brains. These questions has nothing to solve nor sequence to find with higher IQ. IQ is brain operation function and wisdom is memorizing and recall function. You can obtain high education without high IQ as even with mediocre IQ someone can be a rocket scientist or doctor.
That model having the least IQ among all of em was a no brainer
bruv these guys are on something they laughing from every little thing its like they drank a lot of gfuel before or some energy drink and theyre hopped up lol
If her iq is 164 then my iq is 69420
Find Jesus and repent for your sins before its too late brothers and sisters the rapture will happen and it will happen soon trust in Jesus Christ ♥️
i learn english with your videos. thank you so much for subs! that''s really help me:)
I don’t know what IQ tests they’re taking over across the pond but she is not 164. Under no circumstances. She took way too long to answer those questions and she didn’t even get them all right.
One million does not have six zeros bruh😭
bs shes not 164
10:58 IS KILLING ME
IQ is only one measurement of intelligence and tells very little about emotional spiritual creative and many more types of intelligence. I have an IQ of 140 which is high but my emotional intelligence is far beyond my IQ score. In other words don’t think you’re stupid if you don’t score high on IQ. It’s not the end all he all of intellect
23:52 nahh i'm creasing
Great
Even the end result they stood in a bell curve. Also, the group of men judging are like 30 years old and incredibly immature. Delayed adolescence is real & a plague to society.
Spread the gospel
when sharky did the american accent lmaooooo😭😭😭😭
That gyal jasmine hot as fuck tho
Why do sharks sound like Chris rock when he did the accent
No way Niko is first🤣🤣
Caught in 4K chunks said he’s taken loads 😮
164 is crazy
College education has very little to do with IQ. Just look at American university students.
he said pi wrong
Funny😂
NICO WWWW
Sheesh what’s the model ig 🤩
I love danny he seems so sweet
Danny was underrated.
164 is above Einstein, ain't no way, that's crazyyyy
where can i iq test myself? is there any free one's thats accurate?
Abbys IQ casually being higher that Albert Einsteins. i swear niko is effortlessly smart.
Its Chunkz, Niko, Sharky, Kenny and AJ
No i think it should be AJ, Chunkz, Sharky, Kenny then Niko
16:11  “Ayee! How do you know about combs when you don't need one.”💀
164!? WHAT. einsteins iq was 160 BRO OO 😭😭
If she is 164 I am 180 ! That's a joke !
8 corners in a cube?
Spread the gospel
Guys. IQ does not equate to smart lol
This video is racist against white people
19:13 21:11 22:24
he said in 1990 so my guy is right
Ranking are always the best to watching. Thank you for good content we wait with wife for next
152 and 164 is the biggest cap of all time that guy is 152 iq and a delivery driver like Einstein had a 160
Chunkz is on the wrong end. His iq would be very interesting. My guess 130
aj when he said the guy didnt need a comb. stright vio
164 god damn
They don't get that top three are very fken smart xD
nah i can’t lie 70s? that’s mad. She’s talking well below average she don’t even know her iq, and she said yeah stereotyping hahaha
We’re you named after the show… downton Abbey 💀🤡😂
Chunkz has highest IQ
I swear beta squad iq's the lowest in there for sure
Stargate let’s go!!!!!! 19:55
bro, I swear the beta squad is the detective.
This just proves IQ is just bullshit!
Man said albert Einstein walalkis 🤣🤣🤣
wHAT i was completely wrong about abby. and 164 ?!?
For anyone wondering for reference Albert Einstein’s IQ was around 160 so Abby is around the IQ of Einstein
im from australia and no shot blud said Australasia 12:20
164 IQ is crazy but 70 is sad
164 is absolutely mental, I've never met anyone with over a 150 in my life!
Who else thinks AJ is not funny at all? 🤦🏾‍♂️
the host looks the dumbest
disgusting and rude attitude from the beta squad , first time to watch, never again, CRINGE
You can just look at the thumbnail :)
164?! wasnt Albert einsteins IQ like 160? wtffffff
Free the brothers had me crying 😂😂😂😂
Claim your “here within an day” ticket right here 🏆
22:43 what iq test was she taking theres absolutely no way she has 164 and can’t solve a simple math question fam
Anything over 140 is considered gifted and anything over 150 is genius
Einstein’s IQ was 160, so Aby has a higher IQ than Einstein
She think chunks is dumb I agree
I appreciate the riddles
Cool!
Theres 3 Americas man
😂
so danny and abby are smart ash and jasmine is basically mentallly disabled
there is no way they have such a high iq. didnt einstein had like 152? then there would be 2 persons smarter than him in the room
16:06 am said how do you know about combs 😂
god loves u❤
easy just look at their footwear,IE sliders &white socks= dumb.dr marten boots=smart.
I think they should switch aj with chunkz i think chunkz is quite smart
how is a 12 year old smarter than a maybe 22 year old at 109
chuckz and aj should swap and thats the line up
Wasted my time watching this stupid vid
152 and 164 are on a genius level ! Really impressive.
164...just letting you know Einstein iq was 160..
niko definitely has the highest iq
Chunks Stay Single lol . Make A Song Already 👀
"how do you know about combs? You don't need on"  -Aj  that's hella funny But that's the first and last time he will ever be funny
He was wrong for pi nobody verified what he was saying
Lol. This vidéo was fun but its absolute bullshit. I dont know what test they think they did but 70 IQ for Jasmine is almost impossible. 70 is mental retarded. And 164 is probably wrong too, it is so much that it would be almost impossible that she is working in an office making paperwork.  In conclusion, they probably just did a stupid test on a fake site gettin some unaccurate results.
I think the beta squad needs to all go to place 6🫡
Abbys IQ casually being higher that Albert Einsteins
Einstein's iq is 164
she is 164 on one iq test and 115 on another iq test. you need to take cerified iq tests in paper often infront of other people in some sort of facility to actually get ur real iq. its so hard online and not accurate and the environment around allso affects a lot. she is not 164 iq but she is def 130+
What standard deviation? What test? This couldn't be more worthless if it tried.
Beta squad doing an IQ test up next
16:08  " how do u know abt combs, u don't need one " LMAOOO HELPPP
152 as a delivery driver? Also what IQ tests are these people taking? Or is the aim of the game to try and get a different position?
The questions were mostly dumb
Now beta squad needs to go and do iq tests
@suhail24
I think the order of beta squads iQ from smartest to least smartest goes chunks, niko, sharky, Kenny, AJ
i feel bad for Danny- he sounds like a good guy to talk to. Good on him
i have an iq of about 135 and it was actually getting harder to judge the people with higher iq than me with the exception of danny he just reeks of intelligence
Vin diesel 💀
0:40 had me dead
Chunks is definitely more than anyone on beta squad
bro 164 iq is better than Albert Einstein im not kidding look it  up
they didn't do a "good" iq test, knowing that the most accepted for adults is wais-3, where the maximum score is 155, so maybe the values are quite overestimated, but the difference between them  is very impressive
Maybe include the judges as well, would be interesting
"Would you accept dick" had me dying for no reason my humor is broken
Why are they so disrespectful?  Just because they are running the show?
chunkz really muslim they way he counting from right to left
These man don't know Albert Einstein IQ was around 160, she really is a genius 👏🏼
My iq is like 134 lol 164 is an absolute genius 😂😂
Jasmine!!!
dj elbo webs lol
Curly haired girl is pret.
When sharky translated i fell in love-
Who agreed to sign up as the low iq person💀😭
Low key, jasmines @? Anyone know it?
Believe me ive googled it how much kind of money is using today and yeah its much much MUCH more then 20 he was a truely really close
WTF do they even know how wild 164 IQ is, Even 125 is way above average
These Beta Squad dudes are obnoxious as hell... wtf
Wtf man when they gonna upload
Ive been checking every 5 minutes if theyve posted where the video🤨
Anyone got Jasmine's @, asking for a friend
where’s the new vid
When does the new video uploads? Cuz I've been waiting since this morning
these guys ask a lot of stupid questions
When's the next video coming???? ☹️
Right so…… where’s the new video .??????????
if i die tell them the beta squad killed me from laughing
What is Jasmine's @
there are no accurate test for IQ...so that 164 is subjective based on the performed test. And it's kind of weird to have this IQ and work in customer service.
164 IQ and failed that simple math question? Color me skeptical.
just wanna say thank u for the subtitles, ps: I love your videos
the people on the stage all outrank these judges...humiliating
I can’t stop listening to chunkz’ vocals at 8:39
Niko be like SHUSH
wait people can have 70 iq? I thought my 126 was average. But of course, there are many other factors besides IQ that defines how smart you are and I'm probably not very smart considering I didn't know the average iq even though I've taken an iq test. but it's still outstanding to me. Not any hate of course, just saying I didn't think I had that big of an advantage biologically.
i think aj should be like two back
kane was in a footasylum guess the profession video i swear he did something to do with fish
152 and 164 is insane, literally genius level
Bro, yung filly would be last.💀
16:11 this was cold
14:24 Ajs genuine shock when he mentioned Rio😂
AJ: ayii how do u know that u don't even need a comb😂😂😂
this is crazy
New video where is it
10:48 he is technically correct because they didn't state what type of letter
Free the bruddas you know 6:40 😂😂😂😅
Free the bruddas you know 😂😂😂😅
she just casually has the same if not higher iq then albert einstein himself....
Tbh my IQ is 134 and I'm 12 years old
Bro, a person with iq of 70 described herself with one word as „intelligent“.
7:51 🤓"i have"
I got 133 2 years back but dont know if thats good or not
My iq is 140
Jasmine's @?
BRO THE FIRST 2 ARE GENIUSES AND UR LEGIT JUST CLAPPING
I'd love to know which online test they took
When they said describe yourself in one word. I would have said smart ass
Jasmine is a baddie
O LOVE BERA SQUAD
W vid
Ik I can’t be the only one who thinks Jasmine is fine as hell
the guys at the table fail
the first guy is literaly pissed off💀💀💀
This guys are not funny?
Iq tests def ain’t accurate. According to that she has an iq above Einstein
Einstein never took an IQ score test. However, based on his historical records, academics have estimated his score to be around 160.
Pretty sure Einsteins iq was about 160. Dont get me wrong he is a smart guy but some people have almost 200 iq
Mine is 132, but bro, never thought her IQ's over Einstein's and Hawking's... WOW!
bro the way none of them realized how good 164 was... albert einsteins iq was around 160. that means her iq is about the same as einsteins
@? only the real ones would know
The Eye answer actually still applies
Their heights are in a bell curve too🤣
The way you lot went about disrespecting that man had me mad uncomfortable! Especially Niko. What is that about?
Wow she’s a literal genius! I’m flabbergasted! I loved this!
0:12
yo drop da models @ pls
#nikothesmart
Asking them the dumb questions was just boring. At least ask intelligent questions.  Feels like the beta squad are too dumb to ask them intelligent stuff.
Oh my gosh! I just discovered this channel, and i'm already loving you guys.
Petition for bringing back "Find the Gold digger" with fily
“How do you know about combs? You don’t need one” LMFAOOOOOO
Beta squad can u give shout out to sharkcoolstyles in your next video please?
Bruh my iq was like 1001 IQ😅
love how beta squad didnt even realise them man got pi wrong 😭
Sharky is the smartest out of them
I'm so fascinated by Cain somehow he is amazing
164 QI😮😮 THATS higher then EINSTEIN 2X the average!
My iq is higher than all of you
I'm smarter than you
16:12 bro just violated my man
I'm smarter than you all
for reference, Einstein is estimated to have had an IQ of 160
They got 2 uber geniuses wtf
19:07 Chunkz let one off...?
This is so whack. Jubilee is soo much better. Would love to see this on there
If i were to put the beta squad in order itd be Niko first then chunkz AJ Sharky and kenny
Chunks being put last is crazy
Gohdamn jasmine is beautiful
These questions are dogshow. Wtf hahahahaha
Ive got certificated IQ exams. No one was beliving me i had 172.
dude abby pushing einstein numbers fr fr
Rare moments for the history,, Finally blacks judging whites' cleverness 😂
Thank goodness they didn’t
What did they use to determine their IQs? 164 is insane but the 70 is means you have significant cognitive deficits (as a nice way of putting it). Most people are around 100.
I didn't finish the video yet and I haven't read the comments but my guess is that Rich is the smartest. Have no idea how to actually rank them lol
We need chunkz in a blind date thing
Its the way chunkz said "a3outhoo-"' when the girl said theres 6 zeros in a billion 💀💀
We need diversity for the contestants 😂 Where tf y’all findin these ppl 😭
16:55min She didnt know this and she has 164 IQ come on ..wtf!
The guy with the spiderwebs on his elbow is actually the smartest because he’s spiderman
wtf is this
Me who goes private school 😅😅
AJ did Rich wrong with due all respect that was rude and shameful for the man ik the point of all of this is joking and having fun but humilating ppl isn't cool
Bro, wtf, 130 is almost 10% or less, 140 is 2% or less, with 162 in she might be like the smartest .0001% on earth
rich is playing them hard
A 164 is an incredible Genius type of IQ. 💥
(accurately) measuring IQ over 135 becomes highly unreliable anyway. I'm sure she's above 135, but I would take anything over 135 with a grain of salt - not to downplay their intelligence, but because there's really no need to measure any further than that anyways and as such most modern tools (read: tests , because there really is no other way to measure) are not suited to _accurately_ measure (above) that level of intelligence..  Anything over 135 is considered highly gifted and you're already in the 1% top.  The vast vast majority of people also massively overestimate their IQ by a considerable margin because they base their scores on silly online tests. If you get an IQ of 120 on a random online test then i have bad news for you. Do/ purchase an actual WAIS-IV test to start with if you want to measure your intelligence somewhat reliably.  Lastly, all these 'general knowledge' questions do very little to measure actual intellect.
idk what test they used but it's prob very innacurate
mines 160 i didnt expect that wow
I hope they know 164 iq is higher then einstein iq💀
Abby is just lying cap queen🧢🧢🧢
Iq isnt even how smart someone is. Its how easy it is for a persom to learn
I don't accept that question had me dying
I fe bad for the dude in red bc of what aj did😢
cl these go tubers
70 lul
154 and 164 is crazy wtf
I doubt that the IQ-Test they did was really a professional one. With an IQ of 70 or 80, you are disabled and others can immediatly notice that. Also an IQ of over 150 is that rare, that I highly doubt that this is true. A person with an IQ of over 160 never heared of Pi and works basically as a secretary? No way.
ok but iq doesnt really properly measure intellegence
low IQ people grading high IQ ones.
they just made this whole video without even knowing what the iq means
I seriously doubt whatever IQ tests they took, if your IQ is measured to be 70 by psychiatrists, you're diagnosed as clinically "retarded"/ and exhibit specific traits that are common to people in this, range, this is incredibly low.   Same foe 164, if it's true, it's in lik the top 0.001 % or something, it's incredibly high. Already 121 is extremely high (the average is defined as 100, that's litterally how the scale is defined.
160 IQ is GENIUS level. I loved the question by one of the guys: how many member are in the Beta Squad? 😂🤣 After all this, I wanna check what my IQ is.
That looks like a reverse auction
who is the father 😮
Surprised that chunkz didn’t quit in the first 5 min of this video 😭🤣🤣🤣
My iq dropped
Show them more Respekt dislike for that
The man who LANDED A ROCKET ON A COMET is heavily tattooed.
They were much to disrespectful for my liking.
Lowest IQ is the Squad judging them.
"According to Psychologists, there are four types of Intelligence:   1) Intelligence Quotient (IQ) 2) Emotional Quotient (EQ) 3) Social Quotient (SQ) 4) Adversity Quotient (AQ)  1. Intelligence Quotient (IQ): this is the measure of your level of comprehension. You need IQ to solve maths, memorize things, and recall lessons.  2. Emotional Quotient (EQ): this is the measure of your ability to maintain peace with others, keep to time, be responsible, be honest, respect boundaries, be humble, genuine and considerate.  3. Social Quotient (SQ): this is the measure of your ability to build a network of friends and maintain it over a long period of time.  People that have higher EQ and SQ tend to go further in life than those with a high IQ but low EQ and SQ. Most schools capitalize on improving IQ levels while EQ and SQ are played down.  A man of high IQ can end up being employed by a man of high EQ and SQ even though he has an average IQ.  Your EQ represents your Character, while your SQ represents your Charisma. Give in to habits that will improve these three Qs, especially your EQ and SQ.  Now there is a 4th one, a new paradigm:  4. The Adversity Quotient (AQ): The measure of your ability to go through a rough patch in life, and come out of it without losing your mind.  When faced with troubles, AQ determines who will give up, who will abandon their family, and who will consider suicide.  Parents please expose your children to other areas of life than just Academics. They should adore manual labour (never use work as a form of punishment), Sports and Arts.  Develop their IQ, as well as their EQ, SQ and AQ. They should become multifaceted human beings able to do things independently of their parents, teachers & coaches.
Wow, idiots trying to work out who's smart.
now imagine bradley was on here

William Shakespeare was born in 26 April 1564 and died the 23 April 1616. so that facts is not true.

@sidemen and @betasquad be sure to be shooting on the streets of London in the last week of July, I wanna meet you all  there (very humble request :))
I just realized I'm dumb asf because I cant answer half of the questions lmao
Jasmine is unreal 🥵
Just to show how smart 164 IQ is, Albert Einsteins IQ was 160
U can easily put the girls at the last 2 positions. Lol
Like watching monkeys peeling a banana.... o_O
JESUS LOVES YALL HE SAVES HE IS KING HE IS COMING BACK SOON REPENT RUN TO HIM HE LOVES YALL
its definitely chunkz, niko, sharky, aj, kenny in order of smartest to dumbest
Emphasis on beta
Idk but someone should make these guys take a test 😭😂💀 these guys are crackheads 🤣 hahahaha they’re funny tho
Bro what
New sub ...... you guys are the best . Funny .. and real youtuber ive watched so far.... within 3days almost finish watching all the videos .... ❤❤❤❤❤❤

Thats racism. Black people dont rank whites. White lives matters. Stop racism
Hey did the red shirt guy dirty!
13:15
God bless Jasmine if her IQ really is 70
haha those 5 judges combined don't measure up to even 1 of them legit listening to them speak is brain melting.
tion wayne x dave behind the scenes dropping soon https://youtu.be/ERlvk0SBTkY
164??!!! Thats not smart. THATS GENIUS
164 is too high bruh aint no way
Good video but a lot of camera cuts
164 is a fucking mental IQ, like Albert Einstein's IQ was suggested to be around 160 🥶🥶🥶
https://youtu.be/fhEXlKcfh1Y?t=480
I thought she was last lol smh
can i join beta squad      pls
her iq is better the albert, his was 160
I wonder what test they took lmao
the trailer got me hypeddd oml
16:10 nah aj is mad 💀
That's kida easy, all you need to do it add and take away. I got 35. Try something a bit harder then simple adding!
iq does not correlate to smart or stupid.
her iq is not 70 or she'd be genuinely retarded which she is not. come on these people just took an online "what is my iq" test not a real iq test. that puts all the iq scores into doubt. additionally abby being 164 would put her in the top 0.003% of people or the top 2020 people in Britain... she is too clueless and normal for that to be true. the whole video turned out to be a mega waste of my time. danny is the smartest surely
Shocker was lowest iqs were held by the beta squad. Jk, it wasn’t shocking 😏
seek Jesus before it is too late… turn to him before it is too late because we never know when our time is up. You can be any age at any moment and your breath can be taken away just like that. How do you know you will go to heaven when you pass?? You may end up in hell… you may end up in hell because you allowed yourself to live a life of adultery, fornication, sexual immoralit, and just a life of sin over all… not Turing over to God allowing him to cleanse you of your sins and giving you life .. There is one way to heaven and that’s through Jesus Christ our Lord and savior (John 14:6). One thing many people get mixed up is that Christianity is a “religion” when in reality it’s the complete opposite . It’s a relationship with God. And not in that type of way but in a fatherly way.. He loves you and knows your name (John 3:16) (exodus 33:17). He knows how many hairs are on your head to this second ( Luke 12:7) …  God made it easy to go into heaven but it’s up to you to accept him or not. All we have to do is firstly believe in what he done for you on the cross.. he took the punishment for sin and died on the cross for you willingly (galations 1:4)  God knew before hand the pain he would have to suffer on the cross for you. But he still chose to do it because He Loves You…  but not only did he die in the cross for you.. but he rose again on the third day! When believeing that truely we turn from our sins and pick up our cross ( not physically ofc) and follow him letting him lead us guide us through life.. Some people may even ask how do I know if he even real?? God said in his word seek and you will find knock and the door will be open to you (Mathew 7:7-8).. call out to Jesus even if you have to ask him to reveal himself to you he will…. He love you💕  Gospel of salvation 💕 . 1 Corinthian 15:1-4   Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: ——
hhahahhahahha
Someone please explain 11:21
Chunkz’s laugh is soo jarrin now
I agree
3.1415926535897932384626433832
Sorry dawg🤣🤣🤣
26+13+5+9=53
164? Gah dayumn
this cant be right, 70 is too low and 164 is too high
Beta squad is right
Let's just say everyone for sure has a higher iq than the hosts. Their questions were so lame lollll
The model is a 10/10
The American guy reminds me of someone from sienfleld
DAMN
Only Somalis can do this 😂
am i the only one that cringes when chunkz sings ?
Okay wait… is Filly out of this video on purpose? 😅
Chunkz, You are one of the more intelligent of the bunch, you should love you! us fans sure do!
Her IQ can’t be 70, that means she would be intellectually disabled… well, maybe because she thinks her IQ is that low, it could actually be that low, lol.
In love with Jasmin
Isn’t it Sydney?
5:10
Thanks beta squad for doing a great work , I’ve been having hard hard time these days and you guys were there for me and I love you all and thanks for being there with me in my hardest times.
“how do yk what combs are you don’t need one” had me dying😭
Lets not forget that cain got an iq of 125 while being in special care school good for himm🩷🩷
Abby giving The office vibes
beta squad on top
What’s the models @ for research purposes
Does anyone knows whats really happening here?
Iq is based off of pattern recognition basic arithmetic and basic common sense I personally don’t believe you need a high iq too be an actual genius the same way your gpa or sat scores determine your true intelligence. Iq test is like hard puzzles for adults. I personally got 124 and I fucking sucked at school.
Geniuses get ranked by dummies 😂
aj could eat a pineapple through a letterbox
australasia 😂😂😂😂😂
"what do you know about combs, you dont need one"
AJ has number 2 is crazy I'm sorry 😂🤣
in thumbnail theyre wp. whats iq in asia vs europe vs africa?
Did these individuals use a validated IQ assessment or some internet test? The free ones on the internet are extremely generous and it's pretty easy to score over 150 on them. Moreover, did everyone take the assessment in a standardized way? Otherwise, these results are extremely biased.
Buds white and said the N-Word…
Reticent: not revealing one's thoughts or feelings readily.
No way they thought putting a 70iq cute girl in the mix was a good idea
I wonder what test they took. 164 is super high for a woman
Damn 164 is higher than einstein 😳
im pretty sure the pi one is wrong but i dont want to sound like a nerd
let's take a moment of silence to appreciate how GOODLOOKING kenny looks with his facial hair
According to some research, an IQ score exceeding 145 is only found in 0.003% of the population. That's 3 out 100,000 people.  Now a score of 164 is a little bit more rare than "just" 145+. On a 16 SD scale (such as the Stanford-Binet test), an IQ score of 164 is at the 99.9999980964% percentile, which means that only 0.0000019036% of people have this score or higher. This translates to a rarity of 1 in 52,530,944 people.  It's still important to understand that these percentage values are not absolute despite their apparent accuracy. Different tests provide different scores and estimates. For example, according to the IQ percentile calculator, an IQ score of 164 on a 15 SD scale (such as the Wechsler tests) is at the 99.9999999968% percentile, which means that only 0.0000000032% of people have this score or higher. This would translate to a rarity of 1 in 30,938,221,975 people. This estimate obviously differs drastically from the Stanford-Binet estimate above, meaning it's difficult to actually draw any deeply meaningful data out of them... Well, we can confidently deduce is that Abby performs exceptionally well in IQ tests, but not much beyond that.
Man made my day with that ancient tattoo from SG1
I've literally gotten everu question correct.
"how you know about combs, you don't need one" HELPPP
nice
*15:43** keep your islamic propaganda!!!*
the thing is Albert has 160 💀
They r so disrespectful, i would say the n world
Judges must have low IQs if they think they can judge IQs by just looking at a person 😂
This has to radicalise people. Horrible. Britain is ruined.
Anyone know Jasmine’s full name? Asking for a friend 😂
Nice video
model's @?
PLEASEEE DO MORE BLIND DATING THEY ARE SO GOOD!
This is like watching pigeons try to critique opening chess moves
“How do you know about combs you don’t need one”
19:07 did the guy in the middle just smell chunkz and held his nose?😂
TOP G moment in the video "free the brothers" 6:40
Nah niko first then chunks, then sharky, then aj then Kenny
My iq is 127 and im 9 years old
AJ AND THE COMB COMMENT HAHAHA
When is the reveal for the baby coming
*The only thing I know is the average IQ of jury members...* 🤭🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Wow, irony how durag crew discussing IQ while likely not the brightest themselves….   Would be like a group of 5’1 Japanese dudes opining on basketball prowess.
https://youtube.com/@TrendVerseOfficial05
cool
I dont belive education means how smart you are tho
Ik why they skipped Cain
12:58 she answered 1 question and got it double wrong
Cain likes Superheroes, Stargate & coin collecting. If he adds dogs, we can chill.
Idk but niko is defo first
You could see was a model and because of that she is not that smart 😅
6mil now aren't they gonna announce who's having the baby😭
13:15 looks like a white female kenny 😂😂😂
Title 😂
but why 5 people with average 85-100 iq are. allowed to rate others ? XD
Sidmen
Their videos recently have been top quality, setting standards across YouTube and it's clear to see their influence across other top U.K and U.S channels
Man said "Auudhubillah"
dude got PI wrong and nobody even checked lol
How did you confirm their iq's
guess from 3:11   1 santa  2 women 3 crop top 4 bald 5 almost bald 6 farmer
Am i the only one seeing that he said the Pi wrong?
TIL AJ is some kind of crocodile
The way they kept calling Rich “D*ck” was very disrespectful and unnecessary. If it was a bunch of white guys harassing a black man like that everyone would’ve been mad at it. Their humour is very distasteful and unfunny. It’s crazy how they think they’re funny when they look like a bunch of bullies and it’s sad that some of them may be Muslim. Muslims are supposed to have kindness and respect towards others and clean tongues.
Niko is moving sus ngl
15:13
I LOVE THE DJ ELBOW WEB
Einstein's IQ: 160 Random customer service worker who did drama and can't do basic maths: mY iQ iS 164 😂 Yeah right. Good joke. Sad thing is so many idiots think that's realistic. At best she did a fake IQ test that inflates your scores, at worst she just made it up.
152 and 164 IQ people took fake tests for sure (or they're lying). There's no way some amazon driver and customer service worker are on Einstein's level. That's a joke. Next are you gonna tell me the local sewage worker is gonna discover string theory while doing the sewage? If they truly had such high IQs they would be able to do basic maths at least lol. I think their real IQs are between 90 and 120.
Love beta squad
That was such a wrong order for the beta squad members😂Chunkz is definitely first, then probably Niko😂 not too sure about the rest😭
4:16 this is just 😂😂
Hi there Beta Squad, i was thinking that maybe one of those days you can do one where you guess who has the longest WOOD😅 I suggest you do it because with the British humor it kinda will be hilarious please 🙏love your work all the way from Zimbabwe
Jasmine hear me out
CHUNKZ is the smartes of beta squad
bro did anyone else notice at 6:47 Chunkz AJ and Kenny all stopped clapping at the same time???
The way they got pi wrong 💀💀
First I’ve heard of beta squad, pretty appropriate name. But seriously how do you all play a game ranking iq when it’s obvious you don’t know what it is? Also an actress with a sub 80 iq can literally outsmart all of these beta brothas. I will avoid your content like the plague. Skipped to the last 5 mins 2 mins in, should have only watched the last 2 minutes. What a lame excuse for a show. I’m disappointed in you all, try reading a book and then contributing something useful to society instead of making content based on your own biases and prejudices.
Where’s Bradley!!??!!
man said rio that is insane for the capital of Australia
Danny has great potential to get a better job with an iq of 152
niko for sure the 1 AYYY
Nah AJ gotta be last😂
I love the part where they used fake iqs ! I mean seriously 70 something is more stupid than a chimp no human who isn’t severely disabled is that low. And 164 is insanely high Abby is def not 164
That guy with the rat smile has dyslexia.
164 according to what lmfao
When stupid MF'ers rank people on intilligence
i swear cain is from something, he looks so familiar
7:20 wtf is old uk education 😭😭
yeeee free the Tate brothers ;)
They all talk too damn much
People here saying "Omg her IQ is higher than Einstein's IQ" really don't get it. IQ doesn't mean anything. It's not an achievement. Please read the Lewis Thermann research and stop valuing people this way.
Chunks better not have a body count. Haram!!
BROTHERS MAN BRING BACK KONAN AND unknown T back!!! Dating shows are tooooo sick!! 😂
🤣🤣Americans are dumb yet the phones they use, technology they use, and social media platforms they use to make money were created in America.🤣
“What do you know about combs, you don’t need one” 😂
I'm proud of you because you make entertaining your audience seem effortless with such devotion, determination, and desire.❤❤❤
I do not believe their IQ results 🤣
especially for being 14
when i tested, my iq was 135, so im pretty proud of myself
Should put these jokers in iq order 😂
As someone with a 145 IQ I can tell you straightout that Abby doesn't come across as smart at all.
Isn't 164 upper genius, like Einstein/ hawking level?
“What has teeth and can’t eat” I said saw so fast like a chainsaw😂 never would’ve guessed comb
70 is literally borderline mental retardation.
Hi guys first time watching your YouTube channel I appreciate what you are doing god bless you all
The man with the white beard seems so sweet😭
Chunks saying how do you know bout combs, you don’t need one. HAD ME CACKLING 😭😭😭😂
The scores are probably not accurate. They probably took some random test.
Waryaa Waryaaa 😅😅😅
Ngl just looking at them yeeeh JASMINE LOOKS VERY VERY INTELLIGENT  First of all the GLASSES MATE 😂😂😂
We’re they tested under the supervision of a psychologist using a certified IQ test?
crazy that people are doubting Abby’s iq because of her profession and that she is a woman. Even if it was a random test, she still scored higher than all of those people there and maybe more than half this comment section
You can be smart without having money, a crazy job or even an education, just know that guys it’s something not alot of people realise
cant wait for next weeks
Next week I am pretty sure Chunkz will again do nothing
Bro 164 is crazy wth. And she is only working in an office?
i genuinely dont think she has 164, like, what?
11:19 225
just cringe
I saw some disrespect 🙂
Abbey more intelligent than albert einstein but works customer service. makes sense
The one person who finished college was the least intelligent, shocking yet not shocking
In my opinion iq is a horrible test of intelligence.
Sharky translating “how many members are in the Beta Squad?” had me weak 😂😂
can we just appreciate the fact 164 is literally a genius iq.. i loved the smartest persons tactics too lmfao
They don't seem to realise how smart 164 IQ is. That's wild.
idk why but notice something about nikos clothes while he is sitting 18:06
At least we everyone know that America is one of the dumbest country's ever
Of course the model is the lowest🤣
The average persons IQ 98
ads on this video are a joke. had to restart it and had to watch ads for a fucking minute straight twice
I took an iq test in third grade and got 136 but the test only went up to 150, 164 is insane
3.14159
10:57 SHARKY OMG LEAVE US AMERICANS ALONE😭😭😭
That's cap. She is not that smart so there must be something wrong with the test or it's misleading. I'm probably smarter. Argue with a wall but this is bullshit and I'm not replying to your comments. Idiots.
KNEW IT WOULD BE HER
Those numbers were made up or falsely tested or maybe tested decades ago.
and rude
they kind of unfunny
I'm pretty sure the guy with 152 IQ is autistic, so that makes sense
Danny look like he need a hug...
Bro Albert was 160 IQ and shes 164.
Do people actually know that 164 IQ may be smarter than Einstein (Einstein is around 160)
I love abby
is Jasmine a femboy or am I trippin
As soon as i heard 28 letter alphabet i knew it was gonna be below average
She LIED!!! 'yeh maybe' F%%k off!
I am pretty sure these IQ results are not accurate, einstein had a iq of around 160 and Richard Feynman had 125, scoring 150-160 ain’t joke
Nah the IQ don't make sense. 152 and 164 are both insanely high IQ. Einstein is estimated to have an IQ of around 160, I know IQ scores from two different time periods are not directly comparable but still. And I think a person with an IQ less than 70 is considered impaired.
Rahhhh the girl with the lowest IQ is just above the boundary which would make her disabled.
Bro most of these people don’t seem smart lol
Bro why didn’t they put special needs last instantly lol
If she has 164 iq i m then 300+ wtf sge cant even answer simle math not to mention that she dont know what even number pi is and working ofice something this is bullshit
She is NOT 164 IQ
This AJ i would bully the shit out of him
1 + 1 is not a window unless you say equals
16:14 violated 😭
Respectfully I highly doubt those iqs are accurate the model isn't that dumb and I don't think 2 geniuses realistically would have signed up for this video and neither of them seemed particularly smart to me
I would like to hear Danny or Abby's story
I guess the stereotype type is true isn't 🤣🤣
average IQ is 98 for refrence
I knew Danny was going to be gifted (greater than or equal to 130-135). A lot of people with high IQs struggle with traditional education
niko said there are 11 letters in the word alphabet and no one said anything 😭
164 how cuz einsteins iq is 160
I’m ready for next week 😂😂😂
https://youtube.com/shorts/YEEtQKuGqXA?feature=share
1:55 he looks like he removes mascara for a living
1:55 he looks incredibly easy to make on the mii channel
jasmine @?
16:10 😂😂
Okay, so on these days Humans are playing Humans as toys
0:55 looks like Walter White
Can I plz shout me out
done same vids for years same shit
I was skeptical about investing at first, but Robin Brezik changed my mind. She showed me how to invest in a way that aligns with my values and interests. She also helped me avoid some common pitfalls and scams that could have cost me a lot of money. She is not only an investment advisor, but also a mentor and a friend. I trust her completely and I am grateful for her guidance.
if you search ‘albert einstein iq’ then the result says around 160 which is crazy considering this woman is on par with albert einstein himself
But whats beta squads iqs forreal
Im really starting to dislike chunkz
So people know Albert Einstein has a estimated Iq of 160 and Abby got 164 🥶  Also the average Iq in the US is  around 98.9 and in the UK it’s around 99.6
You are telling me that she’s smarter than Albert Einstein when he has 160 and she has 164 how rigged is this
bro i would actually smash jasmine
i thought I clicked on a Sidemen video... but it's n.... no wait it is sidemen ! right ? right ?! oh no it's not there is no white du... wait... Is that Sidemen ?? Pretty much same dudes, pretty much the same concept, EXACT same thumbnail... so it must be pretty much exactly the sidemen right ? ^^
bro im 14 and smarter then them
The way they stayed composed when the guy said he went to a special needs school 🤝
“He is American,he is right”👀🤣☠️
Sharky and Niko defo top 2 for highest, Kenny and Chunkz scrapping for bottom. Kenny will rig the scrap and go 4th
When AJ said don’t downplay it 🥰 bless his tiny little cotton socks
These guys are the worst hosts. RIP valuable subject's time
Next one should be gym lads and one of them is on roids
Those iq values can't be right. 164 and 152 are mega. 70 is special needs. I smell a rat.
Repent of your sins and turn to Jesus Christ before it’s too late❤❤Jesus loves you
the way that aj was almost right according to google, cause there are 12 types of true foxes under the vulpus genus (and then 10 other basically foxes but not [that arent extinct yet] )
you can tell beta squad are really upping the production and effort👏
What are Jasmine's social, she's cute....
The lowest iq is the ppl behind the table quite sad
DO MAFIA
Maybe next time you could do who is the beta squad fan it would be funny❤❤❤
she has a higher iq than elon musk 😭
Se dont know pie or any math and see hot 164 more like 64
ANCIENT LANGUAGE STARGATE SG1 THIS GUY IS GOAT
that guy was wrong when he recited pi, he said 3.1415167 instead of 3.1415926 (or 27 if you were rounding it off)
Dick had Walter white energy
People who say Beta Squad are better than Sidemen are mad. They may be funnier but they are nowhere near as creative. Same video different premise every week.
the model is talking about stereotype and she proved everyone right😂
hey Beta Squad Kenny and Sharky are my fav
I once took a mensa test after a bottle of wine and a bad nights sleep, 164. In mensa it is common with a bad career and high IQ . It starts in school: teacher makes a mistake and you correct him, often a bad choice,  lots of classmates Will also hate you. This handicap will tend to follow you in the jobmarket too, you will be seen as a threat
16:13 "how do you know about combs you dont need one" was Hilarious
bro said australia wrong
Tbf, it’s gonna be pretty hard for 99% of people to guess the difference between someone with 164 and 152 iq. They are both geniuses to the average person.
u need to do a guess who took the virginity in false identity
Yooo
People with 164 IQ is truly smart to think clearly while nobody might realise how intelligent it will be
Wait y’all if there’s five members in the beta squad why is it called a squad
Lol why British people think Americans are stupid?
Listen to Niko by Karan 😂
Ranking purely on appearance...hmmm now how intelligent are they??
*insert Principal speech from Billy Madison*
Logically, they should be numbered from left to right with the highest IQ in the 1st place or #1 position located at left. We write from left to right, and we read from left to right.  The intelligences of the hosts appear to be so low that they don't understand just how intelligent 3 of the "contestants" are, with one being a genius, one being "almost" a genius, and one being well above the average of 100.
Nah Kenny is right. She rrly leng
This video doesn’t show it much but education does not directly correlate with IQ. Some people have insane IQ’s but no motivation or education. Also in order to succeed in college these days you must be a liberal twat
I think the dumbest ones were sitting at the table.
NAHHHHH IM AUSTRALIAN ITS FRICKON Australia not that dumb ass thing that he said…
this is proof models are dumb and it's not a stereotype
Maaan Abby is super sweet ! Hugs to Abby!
152 and 164 that's crazy
There’s no way Jasmine got 70. That’s literally Forest Gump level. Like seriously mentally handicapped and you need assistance with basic things
🙏
Danny seems like such a nice dude
8:25 you can tell they were all holding in that laugh 😅
Anybody know the ig for jasmine?
Damn danny is high IQ but working as an amazon driver
You can tell how smart somebody is from their name Kenny?? Rightttttt 😅❤
Bedankt dat ik hier mocht zijn!
Bro wtf is Kenny doing man🤦‍♂️
She has a higher IQ than Einstein
Wallahi Jasmine had my ting rising.
Niko no doubt the smartest
This may be the must insulting video yet
I’m 137
Making fun of the red mans name was rude that wasnt funny at all
I love niko.
The twist at the end was genius
Kenny stuttered after seeing them pearly whites 4:35
"What starts with E and ends with E but only has one letter in it" How is Eye the wrong answer?
Always a banger😊😊🥰They never fail x
I think if she switched chunkz and aj it would be close to accurate
So are we just going to gloss over the fact that Kenny said the capital city of  Australia was Rio. 😭🧐🤯😳😳
I don't believe for a second her iq is 164. No way they took a MENSA licensed iq test. Just some internet questionaire
164 iq working in a call center is tragic
you should film you guys doing IQ test!
chukz need to be 1st
164 iq us literally higher than Einstein
Dose niko have a white bmw?
Didnt Albert Einstein have an iq of 160 or am I tripping
Y did the editing change all of a  sudden?
These iqs are so cap it’s crazy, I don’t think you understand just how ridiculous 164 is, and 152 as well. It’s completely ridiculous that not one person he fell into the avg range, and the model tested a 70something? R u kidding me, that’s so unbelievably low which is extremely rare too
rich best comeback
Albert Einstein’s iq was around 160 so she has a higher iq than Albert👀
bro i got an add on 3  1  ....💀💀💀
I kinda felt bad for Danny
Einstein's IQ was around 160. That should be enough for them to realise how super smart she is
Even having an IQ is the 150's is fairly up there. 120 still the average?
bro i was so shocked when she said 164. thats more than albert enstien’s. thats crazy ngl
the fact that none of them realized the pi numbers they said arent right
Brudda jas is leeeeng
All you kids do is copy sidemen now?
i seen chunks and nico at socer aid old traford i had one of them horns
5:54 is the moment rich started to hate black
They ask her ''How many letters are there in THE alphabet'' and not ''How many letters are in alphabet'' or ''How many letters are in the word alphabet'' and then it's supposed to be the third one?! These guys' IQs sum up to 80 I bet.
They don't seem to realize how smart 164 IQ is. That's CRAZY.
"Banter"? God help us if this inspires you.
It’s crazy they got a 152 iq and a 164 iq that’s crazy high.
4:33 DUDE I WAS IMAGINING ME ON THE STAGE AND IN MY HEAD I WAS LIKE “my names cain” AND THE PERSON SAID FUCKING CAIN, THATS SO FREAKY
The first guy is from Guess the profession from Footasylum
Imagine if it was white people judging and blacks on stage it would be a outrage if similar behavior was happening. This is insulting
chunkz is the smartest
Hello to those who take the time to read this, Thank you in advance for reading this :)  I am Omar, a 23-year-old student studying to become an English teacher at a vocational school. Together with my two best friends, I want to make my dream come true. My two best friends are Caesar (a 1.5-year-old Australian Shepherd) and Raphael (a 3-year-old Rose-Crowned Conure). It has always been my dream to travel with my pets during vacations, in between my studies.  Saving money is quite challenging for me as a student. A significant amount of money goes towards my education and surviving as a student, especially during this crazy period of constantly rising prices for groceries and housing. Additionally, Caesar tends to be clumsy, and he often ends up causing expenses that eat away at my savings, as they go towards veterinary costs. I've been told that this is just part of the puppy phase :)  My plan is to convert the back of an SUV or station wagon into a sleeping area, so that I can travel and sleep together with my pets, avoiding the expenses of Airbnb accommodations. I would be willing to do anything to make my dream come true. However, as a student with two pets and increasing costs, it is too difficult to reach my savings goal.  Every little bit helps us get one step closer to our travel plans.  https://www.gofundme.com/f/droom-om-rond-te-reizen-met-mijn-bestevrienden?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_campaign=p_cf+share-flow-1
No idea who the smartest is, but the bottom 5 are sitting down.
Abby smarter than Albert Einstein
Jasmine fine af

When we see a show white people judging black ppl like this? wtf
W mark
Chunkz is so cute 🎀🩷💕✨ I just started watching them and I’m staying for him 💀💀
164 and working in customer service is a waste of potential 😂😂
HILARIOUS
The violation of putting chunkz below AJ on IQ🤣 but an even bigger vio for putting him last out the squad 😅
Ngl kenny was the closest with the ranking
6M!!!!! Who is having a baby??
Jasmine is leng what's her @ 😭 I would've put her first ibr
Niko it's what's 1 + 1 =
Aj mocking the Cain "how do you know about combs you dont need one" bruv i died😭AJ was violent today😭
Chunks, niko, kenny, sharky, AJ - order
The good looking woman is least iq idc. 13:50
I could have been in this video maybe my iq is 145
I was not expecting number 4 to be the smartest
Nooo chance they were 150-something and 164 lol
AJ at  19:06 lmaoooooooooo 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
its the one liners & jokes they crack , which are really funny. the vid idea is purely shiatee
australasia
Roasters
Kenny grew a beard dam?
Next video, all of you do an IQ test
I’ve got 154 iq
My boy got a sg-1 tat, that's fire af
how tf she got 164 thats insane
Nikos personality is so leng oh my goodness me
no pro iq test for adults measures above 160, this is fake
Yooo
Chunks needs to calm down. You have money, yes, but only a lot for you. Everyones seen more. Boy needs to be humble.
man if another group, more younger and mad like you beta squad would do something together would be fire
Damn pretty concerned that they are to simple to realize 164 is high iq. 😂😂😂
Nah why Abby put all the durags on the low side
I don't blev their scours
honestly don’t believe her iq is 164 and went into university for drama
The continent question changes depending on where you’re from, and the alphabet question also changes depending on what language you speak.
So these guys are really just roasting people of their answers
Im so disapointed that no one knew pi, they just accepted what he said.
Kennys question about the eye, the brother mark got the answer right im pretty sure
damn legit genius out ere.
bruh albert einstein has the iq of 160🤯
SO FUNNY 10/10 😂😂😂
Cool 😎
i would have described myself as intelectual
the fact that kenny was almost right
Sharky :Man of the video "How many members are in the Beta Squad"  sent me 🤣🤣
164 is EINSTEIN level
“Hey how do you know about combs akh you don’t need one”
How tall is aj ?
Rich looks like the UK version of Walter White
Can we talk about chunkzs boxers
The fact that when chunkz said he had a high score in the iq test AJ said, "Then what are you doing in Beta Squad?" is so funny 😂 18:28
I love hoow they put almost identical order of iq'd in the thumbnail.
No shot she had a forest Gump IQ 😂 she fell asleep taking the test or something to
Harsh though, because you don’t know them and assuming there IQ
The one with the tattoos is a skinhead fs
70 iq💀 that’s the average iq of a third grader
Beta squad are literally copying the Sidemen😭
OK U HIT 6M WHO IS THE PARENT
Chunks went to soccer aid and played really good 👍
Is it me or this looks like a slave auction in reverse😂
11:22 answer is 225 ur welcome
stargate is sick. always glad when someone mentions it.
I have the iq of 135 , I am better than an average maybe
70 is wild bro☠
So out of order that business card moment with Mark and aj around 5.37 mins.  Them lot looking like some rich guy nob ting with that one. Same kinda muggy stuff happened throughout in small doses. Them lot need to stop letting the high life get to thier heads. Money doesnt mean much lads, u need community//// im a fan of the previous stuff think they lot are great, its best when its all organic and not overly edited//// i dont know shit im just some lad who enjoys a good vid from funny guys but u know what im saying, its getting a bit spoiled
i'm gonna be honest, these videos are getting boring to watch
160 and couldn’t do a maths equation? It’s simp,e problem solving which I thought high-IQ people were supposed to excel at
Do you guys think iq test means a lot? Does it really test your smarts?
There is no way one of them has an IQ in the 70s and another in the 160s...
is no one gonna deep the beauty of chunks vocals at 8:41
How can they rank them from dumbest to smartest when the beta squad are all dumb haha😂
Sharky doing an american accent cracked me up! 😂
y'all should do guess the fighter with Leon Edwards 😂🤘
Bro Albert instein IQ is around 160 thats wild
5 minutes in, i would say those 5 from beta squad is the dumbest.
that gyal is leng i beg someone gives me her @
18:45 niko noone wants to see ur boxers
accent maakte mijn dag lol
Na my guy smashed the starts with E ends in E question and none of them even noticed he was right…
I dont believe their IQ is that high honestly...
100%, order from Dumbest to Smartest should be Kenny, AJ, Sharky, Niko and Chunkz lol
yall have the worst thumbnails
Swap aj and chunks 24:38
Just to put into perspective, Einstein's IQ was about 161
That means Abby’s IQ, higher than Einsteins, IQ
😂😂😂😂
0:29 isit just me that heard woodiyaaa
Are we all just ignoring that final scene on the stage 😂
IQ doesn't mean anything.
id say chunkz then niko then sharky then kenny then aj
164 is literally insane
top 2 are lying u don’t have one of the highest iqs in the world and work reception and delivery driver
I know for sure that they took an online IQ test which is completely inaccurate. With an IQ of 164, she should've been able to answer that math question easily since it was an easy question
AI HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THE COMBS AKH YOU DON'T NEED ONE i died😂
obviously models are dumb but beautiful...well, most are...but kenny was right...SHE LENG ASF oof
Smarter then eisnein for 164
8:38 HAHAHAH 8:55 HAHAHAH 11:06 LMAOOOOO 24:09 NO i think 5. AJ 4. kenny 3. sharky 2. niko 1. chunkz
Kenny looks like he's aged 20 years
yeah, 164. right right... Bugged test probably
We don't emphasize it enough, but thanks to the editor for the subtitles. I am French and it helps to have them for understanding when speaking quickly
Bruh y’all gotta start given jubilee a cut or something 😂
164 is is soo high dummy’s 😂😂
im rly sad. i always thought it was scored out of 100. now ik im dumb 😢
Why would aj not take his card… that’s terrible yous have a lot of followers he thought you were taking it
This was such a good show!! Of course, the 164 IQ is super impressive and makes me wonder if everything said was just a tactic😂😂  Well I hope every one has a good morning. Jesus died for all our sins on the cross and His blood was shed to set us free so that we may have freedom from sin, depression, addictions and more if we trust in the work He does. I was healed from my depression and my sins and I truly know what it is to be free and in control of my body and emotions. Jesus Christ was buried and on the 3rd day He arose from the dead and if anyone believes in Him, they shall be saved. Saved by Grace alone, through faith alone in Jesus Christ alone ❤
I did not like the way they treated the guests. It could be someone’s father.
Models are failed in education 100% they are stupid but she must be getting paid the most which life is not fair
Beta squad is amazing
164 IQ & went to university.  But works as a receptionists. & she doesn't know basic arithmetic. It's as if IQ scores mean absolutely nothing.
164 my ass
Jasmine had me fooled can’t lie
Chunkz is so funny. I love him 😆🔅❤️
Sideman copy 🤣
18:37 thats my name
164iq and doesnt know the answers to basic questions. Kinda doubting her iq.
Chunkz' laugh is the reason I still live
beta squad make me feel smart
The beta squad should do a real IQ test so we know who's the smartest
Not nicko getting defensive at 7:50 aha " I have " gone to college , yeah ... for one day aha a,m I actually believed for a second
can see why chunks wasnt invited wasteman so annoying
not certain about your IQs but I'm pretty sure Filly has the lowest.
Niko kept scuffing his riddles 😂 he said how many letters is in the word the alphabet but thats 2 words and he said what is 1+1 but forgot to say = which is the top and bottom of the window so his riddles didnt even count 😂
Niko humor 🔛🔝
Me and AJ had the same face when Kenny said Rio was the capital of Australia 🤣🤣🤣
Why didn’t yall actually show their business cards….? 🤔 lame
I think Nicko followed by Chunks is smarter from all the beta squad videos I have watched
Australasia isn't a continent, Australia is a country and a continent, Australasia is just the region/location that includes Australia, New Zealand etc. The 7 continents are Europe, Australia, Africa, Asia, South America, North America and Antartica 12:14
whats jasmines @
What’s the next number in the sequence? 223?
Hi Beta Squad, my name is Nkosinathi Mkhize and I am an upcoming Content Creator from South Africa, tomorrow is my Birthday day and pls buy me something that can help me kick start my YouTube career, all the way out from South Africa and we love you 🇿🇦❤🙋🏽‍♂️
Something about Niko and his humour with middle aged people, it’s so jokes 🤣🤣🤣
I wish they would stop posting the answer on the thumbnail… *sigh
Ma'am has a higher IQ than Elon Musk
i know niko will win the last to escape the jungle
19:08 AJ sniffing Chunkz. He is not serious 😂😂
At the end when Niko said "we're gonna make this interesting" i was convinced the trailer was gonna be ppl need to rank them from lowest to highest iq, and their starting positions would be like the lady set them or idk. then i saw the trailer. u should actually do that it would be interesting af
The first 3 at the end got big brain
The trailers just keep getting better and better. Beta squad on top
I already know Chunks is backing out of all the challenges next week
If darkest sees this I said Darkest man alive that is a no brainer You lost your hair don’t lose your teeth use a retainer  You can’t even sing so you can’t have a feat When you were nineteen you would wake up with hair on your sheet You went bald that is no fair you go out with a sign that says “no hair people be aware”  You make a meal people say it is bussin  Little do they know you get it from chunkz because you are cousins   (Sorry chunkz nothing against you from that last sentence)  I know that made you cry  Now you want leave like hair it said bye bye    ( I had to roast darkest because it was for purpose of earth)
Irony is these guys had to rank their intelligence.
IQ doesn't mean how smart you are....
my guess is  Niko, Chunks, Sharks, Kenny and Aj
take an actual IQ test!!!!
Nikos the smartest
ABBY SMARTER THAN EINSTEIN
Albert Einstein had an iq of 160, these lot really down playing how much 164 is 😂
Sidemen vs beatsquaddd pls
Can we realise that the 164 iq couldn't solve the easiest math equation
I don’t think cabbage heads IQ was 164
These dudes are funny can't Wait next Saturday already
Danny and Abby are statistically ingenious. But 164 is absolutely insane. Both Rich and Cain are also incredibly smart in terms of IQ. And 70 made me double take
So what iq is the highest
Congrats. You've motivated me now to perform a LIVE video with the opposite. A panel of white people judging black people. Let's see which video wins ;)
What's with the blatant rascism? You're all black people, and your contestants you judge are all white? Blatant racism. This is disgusting. Disliked
Complete mental
I hate to be pessimistic, but the sheer rarity that you have someone with an iq of 70 who went to college ( which means they graduated high school which for that individual would be wildly hard is ridiculously unbelievable) 2/100 people are at this range, not to be offensive but these are people who would struggle with any basic comprehension skills. The girl didn’t demonstrate any serious impairment.  Additionally The girl who got 164 iq is also ridiculously unbelievable considering that’s 0.0008 in rarity…. It screams fake   Theory- 5 lazy people who own a YouTube channel figured it was too much work to actually do a 5 hours long test for each person so they hired a group of actors to deceive people for entertainment
i cant wait for next week
Anyone know jasmine @ ? 🗿
i love listening to chunkz randomly sing!
The problem is these guys judging are being given authority but they are clowns, and evil assholes gave them the authority. It is to cause confusion.
Please do this video but about body counts🥺😁
The last bit w Abby is so cute
70😭
Cool beta squad video
70 something?? Lord
The next video gonna a banger and tbh Beta Squad are making new video concepts everytime.. thats why i see em better than the Sidemen !
14:39 WAIT WTF UR TELLING ME WE ALWAYS HAD JOE BIDEN AS THE PRESIDENT I THOUGHT HE WAS NEW
or you can call this blacks judging whites....RACSIST!!!
Tbh i would need proof of that 164 iq. except if she was acting, having such a high iq and not be able to do simple quick maths or know the value of pi is quite concerning
This gotta be fake. An iq of 164 is higher than einsteins 160. They probably took an inflated IQ test
listen. that GAZE at 7:15 I'M IN TEARS he's going after Raven's job
Rating IQ for Beta Squad: 1. Chunkz 2. Sharky 3. Niko 4. Kenny 5. AJ....
Albert Einstein was only 160
I aint tryna be a hater but 164 iq is cap Albert Einstein was around that 💀
I thougth it was Rio is wild
High iq person won’t appear in this
Beene beene
i bet niko the winner of last to leave the jungle, sai it first here
@10:34
I thought it was Rio 😆
Its funny how old guys have to watch little boyz joking around with their names with no repercussion .
Its 1+1 equals window, atleast say the joke right
BRING BACK MAFIA NOT THIS CRAP
the math question given at 17:00 was in fact not 35 and was 33. the beta squad should have someone rank their iqs.
these videos r too dead like being back mafia
And I was impressed with my 140 IQ LOL
With all the general Knowledge n spelling vids we’ve seen AJ on he’s defo way too high on that list Abby did loooool😂😂😂😂
164 is higher than einstein iq
i believe it goes chunkz, Niko, Sharky, Kenny, and then Aj last 😭
"hey, why do you know about combs you don't need one" that one was wild 😭
164 yea smarter than Einstein
Sheeko waalan waaye
The tests are definitely not legit abby would literally have a higher iq than Einstein.
That Sharky american accent had me rolling
This was an amazing show ❤✌🏾🏙️🍾
Love beta squad ❤
The manderm are funny 😂😂
I think I’m the only person who realized the thumb nail is the order but back words🧐
Bro chunkz was SAGGING 21:14
Mental retardation is declared at lower than 75-70
When they played the trailer my first thought was Chunks is not gunna do any of those challenges
Chunkz saying AJ has 106 teeth made me do a literal spit-take ffs
Ok lock in my picks 1. Chunks 2. Niko  3. Sparky 4. Kenny  5. AJ
The pewnews music at the beginning gave me flashbacks
shoulda asked if jasmine made her own clothes ygm
holy shit sidemen and beta squad constantly copy
How can Abby have the same iq as Albert Einstein??
Spoiler alert The thumbnail is almost the spoiler
121,144,169,196,225??
just find them very disrespectful
Thats mad abby got t more iq than Einstein
Yeah your adds are taking the p*ss still😭😂
I LOVE THE AMERICAN HAHAH
next week niko is gonna win obvs lol
I hate how they treat them
THEY HIT 6 million… who is having a kid???
I see Chunkz getting eliminated first in the next video already 😂😂
“I don’t like that question.” Threw me off guard 😭
I think shark's up there
Einstein was 150, and these muppets don’t even Get faced that they’re around a litteral Genius
Not Me knowing the value of pi from mabu
When Chunkz said correct as for the order, he meant it as a fact ? Was abby correct?
9:05 😂
160iq hard cap😂
Chunks your on the winning team on soccer aid but wxi will clutch up  and destroy you
Why does noone talks about danny, he seems sad and it makes me feel bad, does anyone know him so we help him
POV: Alright Danny, what's 1+1?😂
Who else was ranking the Beta Sqad instead of those on stage 😂
NAHHHHH AJ VIOLATED AT 19:03
The guys sitting at the table seem dumber then the guys on stage
Jasmine was bad tho icl
I love AJ. Bro is so kind❤️
Guys, please one word. Is crazyyyyyyyy 🤣🤣 tryna drink coffee laying down and watching the beta squad is impossible I have to go clean my sheets now
164? she is 0.00008 percent in the iq chart that means an 80 year old person might never met one in their ENTIRE LIFE
einsten iq was like 160 so abbby is smaaaart
Abbys smarter then Albert Einstein
I think she arranged them correctly! But Chunks should be first. Other than that, spot on!
If Niko was asking about the letters in the word alphabet, he'd have to exclude the word "the"
Einsteins IQ was around 160
God if I was on this I would deffo be the dumbest
dummies
I believe Sharky has the highest IQ, then Chunkz, Niko, Kenny, AJ
5:54 I actually got an ad 😂
Good good good good good video 🎉
Jasmine is attractive!, but that IQ is crazy
164 isnt much for an adult tho💀💀
Abby looks like jenna fischer
Honestly Danny seems like a good guy.Lifes probably been hard to him,big respect my man Danny.
I know already that the model is the most stupid, because the job that you only need to pose😂 AND when a womAn wear bare stomach shirt, she is kinda low IQ.
sharky 1 chunkz 2  niko 3 kenny 4 aj 5
Chunkz is the smartest among them lmao
Can’t wait for Bertrude to react to this
The best video I've watched this year 😭
Highest to lowest Chunkz- niko- sharky-Aj- Kenny
I love him omg he's so good I can't see
Without anyone introducing themselves I feel like it’s the red head… Rich was smart with that d question lmao.. I was pretty good with guessing
16:10 chunks was a menace bro cooked too much fam 🔥
Thats crazy bc Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein both had an estimate IQ of 160
should be, chunkz, niko,sharky, kenny then aj
6:36 I lost it when they said "Free The Brothers"😭😭🤣🤣
6:22
hi hoda / dado
who got an ad on the countdown please give a like 😤
19:08 what he sniffing lol
16:13 AJ did cain dirty
When the dude answered EYE he was technically right.
When chunks sang yeah man I was vibeing
What starts with "E" and ends in "E" but only has one letter in it. The answer is E - he never said it was a word, because he wanted to create a trick question. Envelope would be correct, yet "E" would also be correct! Oh but a vowel is not a letter, it is a sound? Like WTF, as if a letter is a letter, it's also a sound. It's a matter of opinion and ideological subversion. Are you subverted enough to think that the alphabet which has 26 letters in, including all the vowels, which are classed as letters. Are actually sounds? Contradiction much? An here in, ends your lesson class. The answer is "E"
She is pretty smart for a genius😬
Dj elbow webs killed me
Whats Abby @ cuz there's something about her
I was cracking up!  Soooo funny!
let's play monkeys laughing at people
she has a 164 but couldn't answer a simple math quwstion
abby has einstein Iq
Omd 70! 😭😬 I remember reading somewhere years ago that 70 is mental retardation or something
I think y’all attracted a racist for this eps 😂
19:08 😂😂
18:44 niko’s underwear
My iq is 167 anyways so i dont see the big deal
I’m so
australizia

Niko  Chunkz Sharky Kenny  Dwarf
.
This is definetly cap bruh💀 Ain't no way that she has an IQ of 164, I wanna see her taking a real IQ test on camera
So much better than the sidemen.. holy shit
Why the counting them from right to left
164 iq working customer service? you really never know how many genius people you meet on a day to day
abby could have been atleast a doctor this is a  failed society
A typical IQ test consists of taking various tests measuring intelligence including; spatial recognition, short-term memory, mathematical ability, and analytical thinking   For those of you commenting that not being able to do simple math is not a measure of how high or low ones IQ is.  Yes, there are very intelligent people who are strong in history, weak in math etc. but an IQ over 160 and weak simple math skills? I just don’t buy it. I may give you a break on analytical thinking because I do think your environment plays a role there (the biggest flaw in IQ testing); but 1+1 is 2 every day of the week   For the record I don’t think you are genius because you aced an IQ test either
15:43 Chunkz LOL
What test did the contestants do to get their results?
Like*
i usually like watching their videos but how rude they are at times to these guests isnt really doing it for me...
14:06 he's wrong he forgot to add the =!!
164 is higher than 99.999% of the population where the fuck do they find these people
I really didn’t want to lie this video cause it should’ve been funny but they just don’t miss👏🏾
if you guys didn't notice they put the correct smartnes on the thumbnail
BETA SQUAD RANKING 1 NIKO 2 CHUNKZ 3 AJ 4 KENNY 5 SHARKY
Bro I’m 13 and I’m like 130 iq how dumb do people get
You are actually making the best content can’t wait for the jungle omllllll ❤
There’s 6 zeros in a 1,000,000
Neeko has the highest
She is smarter then Albert Einstein
nice
WHAT IS THAT TRAILER?!!!!!
Am I the only one that thinks niko tries way too hard to be funny and it's just annoying😂
'Chunks that sexist man' LMAO
Amin test😳
Ye no she does not have a 164 iq. I can tell I’m much more intelligent than everyone and I have a 132 iq.
THIS IS A BANGER DAAAAMN
Why did you not reveal the true ranking for the beta squad at the end 😭
Kenny should have asked for her number icl
Niko said that 1+1 question wrong. Meant to be what does it equal, not just, what’s 1+1 cos 1+1 is two lol
Does jasmine have an IG or something?
aj is a rat
Niko showing all his teeth😂😂😂
btw iq does not indicate intellegence. it is a ranking of intellect which is mostly associated with the left brain. the right brain is completely seperate and is needed just as much if not more for seeing the bigger picture, being creative and compassion. the right brain cant be ranked
Aight but where can we see more of Jasmine though
BRO I THOUGHT I WAS DUMB 🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Since you all haven't gone to university, you should play false identity with university students.
11:02 is just too funny sharky translatin
Jasmine is beautiful tho
whys no one talking about sharky in 11:11
Nah Jazmine cant be 70, thats borderline disability territory
Chunkz singing is so jarring
121. 144. 169. 196. 225 ?
Interesting
There are 2% natural redheads in the world,1% with blue eyes and those who are left handed or ambidextrous are considered genetic mutants 💁🏽‍♀️💯
14:22 « I THOUGHT IT WAS RIO» PLS
How tf does Abby have a 167 iq but works in customer service? Go solve quantum physics bro
the board members are the least intelligent of the bunch, in the end.  what a twist!
just from watching the trailer im sooo excited for next week
16:11 mad unnecessary man got smoked for no reason wallahi
Good luck with soccer aid chunky and Niko
"It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.
Yoooo chunkz laugh funnyyy. Uh huh uh huh uh huh 😂😂😂😂
free my nigga in the red shirt😂
broooooo jasmine, how you doin
A cube has 6 faces not 8
Im losing brain cells just from watching
May i have uss argo code?
AJ sniffing Chunkz  at 19:08 💀💀
The number sequence are squared numbers in order.  225 is the next number to follow in the sequence.   11 squared is 121. 12 squared is 144. 13 squared is 169. 14 squared is 196.  So 15 squared is 225.
How can strangers be judged by people who are more dumb than them? These judges look so stupid, superficial and without any skills.
Name five words that rhyme with trigger lol dude definitely wanted to say n*****
Man just wanted to know jasmine names 😂😂
do they get money for participating? I hope so
To be diagnosed as having mental retardation, a person must have an I.Q. below 70-75, i.e. significantly below average. :DD
I dont think chunkz knows we can see his boxers😂😂
Ty for subtitle love from france 🇫🇷
21:13 hit me with a 15 sec double add
70 iq??? thats crazy
164 is actually Genius level
Oi these man would do great voice acting for the Hyena's in The Lion King 😂 bmt
I’m quite disappointed that Beta Squad doesn’t even know what IQ is.
You guys should do 6 real fans and 1 fake fan
ret·i·cent /ˈredəs(ə)nt/ adjective not revealing one's thoughts or feelings readily.
kenny - AJ - sharky - chunkz - niko   Is the right order from dumb to smart
Chunks smoking AJ on steady 😭😂
nico's attitude was so apt throughout the show...i assumed he must be in the top 3 somewhere....
Right.
"I like you Abs" - Abbey proceeds to put Chunkz at the very last when he might be the smartest member 🥶
Trailer looks mad 🤩
GOAT YOUTUBERS
Niko chunkz sharky kenny aj
He’s an English major
That was stupid! Clearly not right. an IQ of 70 is very low, and 164 is exceptionally high.
This could be funny but yall keep making bullshit questions lol
Please do BETA SQUAD - Silent Library Edition!!! 🔥
Did Chunkz just I can see "Albert Einstein walaalkiis?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Any somali speaking whp heard that??
Kenny's question was real useless, its triggering me
NIKO IS GOING TO SMOKE CHUNKZ AT OLD TRAFFORD
i wanna see beta squad make a video like this except its them doing it and their friends choose who they think is smarter
It's Chunks, Niko, Sharky, Kenny and lastly AJ
164iq is higher than what Einstein’s was estimated to be and Stephen hawkings
33
LMAO IM CRYING 😭😭 Niko is always quick with it 😭
one of the most idiotic show there is
Once AJ said: Chunkz: Name a Country starting with V. AJ: Vinland. Venus.
18:12 the subtitle says i cant be arsed🤣
The term "moron" was coined by early 20th Century psychologists, and has been applied to those with an IQ of 70 in the past.
164 is mad
For reference - an IQ of 152 is categorised as very gifted.   Einstein is estimated to have an IQ of 160, so Abby's 164 is genius level.
18:04 I agrée
Is it known which IQ Tests these guys took? And also if they took the same ones? Just asking because different tests measure different domains of intelligence and have a different validity. Also above 160 is insanely high, if this was a scientificly validated IQ-Test she took, she belongs to the most intelligent people in the world!
eye also only has one letter in it, i
13:06 send her to the 6th place /hj
12:44 technically there are 5 continents. 12:59 rich is smart
11:28 225
9:07 😂😂
Chunkz bodycount and aj's teeth 😂😂
what world are we living in... hypster dummies, some wearing slippers over socks are "ranking" people... and human beings are wathing this. And shit like that lands onto the page of people who want to view something entertaining on the weekend.
Positions 1 and 2 are both considered geniuses
‘How do you know about combs , you don’t need one !’ 😂
lol a cube has 6 sides not 8
chunkz would be the best grandfather
Chunks -Niko-Sharky-Kenny-Ksi-Harry-Jidion- Salt Papi-AJ.  That’s the right order
Bruh what’s jasmines @
Niko > chunks > sharky>aj>Kenny
Play the trailer got me some serious shi ttt is coming can't wait
So Abby’s IQ is a 164 which is at a genius level whereas Einstein’s IQ resides at 160? Something is off here
I can relieve chat Thais justo Jade lyntropones
164? U TELLING ME SHE IS SMARTER THAN ALBER EINSTEIN?
, Niega!
That outro tho
I’m pretty sure the tests r very unaaccurate 164 howww Einstein was around 160 ain’t no way
Wtf 164 , it’s so fkn much
Sidemen have gotta up their game - love both groups but Beta Sqd are killing it
The American wasn’t wrong when they asked what starts with E and ends with E but only has 1 letter in it😂 He said EYE, but if you think about it, eye sounds like the letter I, and also starts with an E and ends with an E😂
They really made the thumbnail the actual order 😂
In RP it’s the perfect way for him to get a vest, he said this is my chance to prove myself 😂
I believe the IQ ranking for Beta squad:  1. Chunkz  2. Niko  3. Sharky  4. Kenny  5. AJ
Lord above, Jasmine is gorgeous
I think the correct order would be AJ, Kenny, Sharky, Niko, Chunkz 🤣 but they’re all number one in our hearts🥰
Niko chunks aj sharky kenney
The Content we need right now
They should’ve got Beta Squad to do IQ tests 😂
16:12 AJ mannnnn😭😭😭😭😭
What’s jasmines at ?
Welp, they are definitely all smarter that the staff out there.
Why are they so smart. The person in the middle is literally in the top 5-10 percent
are we gonna ignore the fact that they both said the wrong values of pi😭
Fav YouTubers 💗💗💗
nah DJ elbow webs killed me
The literal answer is on the thumbnail 😂
Top video no lies👏🏽👏🏽❤️
Too me the people on stage are smarter then the jury
Guetto guys judging IQ? Hahahahaha😆😅🤣😂😆😅🤣😆😅🤣
Not Kenny saying genuises 😭
wtf einstein had abt 160 iq bro abby a genius
Ain’t no way her ass has a higher iq than Einstein
I disagree with abbey slot as chunks is smartest then aj Kenny niko and least iq sharky.
That little run chunkz did at 8:40 🔥
what is the value of pi *lil mabu has entered the chat*
The fact bro said the wrong value of pi and they didn’t realise 😂
Pog
Nah Abby’s arrangement is a joke  AJ is on top 2 😂
I don’t even know what my iq is but I surely below 80 lmaoo
IQ world map IQ heritability
beta squad should do an iq test 🤣🤣
https://youtu.be/rf78rEAJvhY .   Do the Beta Squad know about sun dimming?
Has Chunkz lost weight? He looks like a completely different person.
They need some people to judge beta squad Iqs now 😂 maybe Sidemen
The moment that dude said "Reticent", I was like bro, give him number 1
But why change the color of the clothes in the thumbnail?
my brother is racist that he thinks the beta squads are bears.
an iq score below 70 is considered an intellectual disability, between 70-79 iq score is borderline impaired. an iq score of 165 is in the top 0.0008 percentile. you guys got a real broad spectrum of minds here.
If kenny is the one having a child why did be say number ywo is lengggg ?
snarky deffo has the highest IQ
Actually insane Abby is saying she has a higher iq then Einstein had.
yo imma be honest, all there questions were absolutely useless
152 is wild too don’t disregard ma boi
my order is niko chunks kenny aj and sharky in descending order of iq
15:54 16:18
What is jasmine @
ABBY SNATCHED THEM ALL
They all dumb 😂
21:11 chunjs boxers😂
IQ over 69 I guess I have to unsubscribe
These IQs are bullshit, did they just assign random numbers? 😂
70 iq is low af
164 is wild. I'm 147 and consider myself to be pretty intelligent, but 164 is truly astonishing. I'd love to converse with her.
Aj - “how do know about combs”, “you don’t need one” 😂
The iq tests these guys took are defo fake tho cause Einstein’s IQ was between 160 and 180 and I’m sorry but there’s no chance any of them are close to that
Dead vid
That lady's iq is definitely not 164. Whatever online iq test she took is lying
They probably did fake online IQ tests cause ain't no way they're all geniuses
Anyone got jasmines insta?
اعوذ بالله 😂😂😂
sharky's joe biden one proved he isn't the smartest man in the room, what was that. lol.
Kenny saying he thought *Rio* was the capital of Australia has me dead 💀
big up the amazon flex drivers
bakis video
Big brain movements
If I’m not marrying Niko im just not getting married >:D
Wtf 164 is mad u know
70iq💀
Kenny thinks every girl is leng 🤣🤣🤣
pi one is 3.141592653589793238
Niko, Chunkz, Sharkz, AJ & Kenny.... Highest to lowest for me. Like this if you think I'm right? 😂
<---- Win your Favourite Youtuber Merch, would appreciate it. Cheers
Beta squad is actually popping of right now. Keep this consistency and you’ll beat anyone. Can’t wait to next week I know it’s gon be a banger
Goats
Wax kale 🥬
Jasmine is 🔥
Niko is always so funny bruh😭
Who is gonna have a child
you guys should do a video where you all take an iq test
Them adverts were rediculus
Kenny was really feeling the model girl 😂
If only BeetleJuice was there...
what about there respective field intelligence ?
These vids just keep getting better and better
starts with "E" and ends with "E" shouldnt the answer be "E"?
A first ain't hard to get 😂
70 is the iQ of a dog lol. Jasmine must be so dumb, if that is true.
Chunkz take your pants up haha
anyone notice how kenny said he thought the capital of australia was rio 😭
am i the only one that thought of Jesus Christ when Kenny said "What goes up, but never comes down?"
reticent adjective not revealing one's thoughts or feelings readily.
Chunkz: I’ve got QI 😂
sharky has to the father of the unannounced baby💯🤫
164?
Mans wasn't wrong though when he said "i" for "what starts with an E, ends with an E and only has one letter in it" it just depends on the spelling. Starts and ends with E --> eye and one letter --> i.
Albert anisthein wallkis😂 got me
164 🧢
So ironic how 5 morons are trying to figure out who's the smartest on stage.
♥️♥️
i like their old set where everything was in white
8:26 all the awkward laughs got cut 😂
Accualy love these guys , love the content,Love everything yall deserve all the subscribers in the world tbh
20:57 I can see chunkz and Niko's underwear
4:50 I find him the funniest 😂
Are you kidding me!!! Now I have to wait a whole week😂 !!! Next video will be hilarious
Hell nah, they have to retake those IQ tests. 2 of them is in top 0.1% of people in the world.
Iq tests are only quantitative between 85 to 130, beyond those limits the test is approximate overall there is no clear way to know if #1 and #2 are in the right order (I phrased this to not give away any real info if you haven’t watched it yet 🫡)
Beta Squad provide content that is entertaining. Ever since I started to watch them, I haven't watched any Sidemen videos. I believe everyone has their time and back in the day the Sidemen were making content that was top-tier but now I don't find their videos entertaining as I once did (maybe I grew up.)
😂niko was built different no lie
Beta squad > sidemen
”On my life i’ve seen him before”
They all got pi wrong... Also Kenny saying he's smarter than average person is wild
Chunkz will leave the jungle first 😭
Great video
Ion gon lie I need jasmine’s socials
uhhh i took a iq test in romania and i got 164,56 iq ( im 13 years old)
5:44 AJ IQ Reveal, dont do that little triangle
THE DAY I ( Been Waited For.)
Snigger 💀
12:21 is bro tryna say Australia 😭😭
https://youtu.be/OSBan_sH_b8
damn my iq is 137, they found some geniuses
Chunkz always blessing us with those vocals
Has anyone got the models @
Waiting to watch this vid with Simon
my dude showing tongue on the curly
To be fair it’s crazy that they go from 88 to 119, it goes from a below average to an over average skipping the norm completely, everyone from dick on is very smart, while the last two are downright geniuses
I FKN KNEW IT BRUH. I ABSOLUTELY SMASHED AT GUESSING THE FIRST 2 RIGHT
i feel bad for the people up there
Chunkz personality is always such negative and mean.  Strange to see an almost 30 year old acting likethis
14:24 I AM DEAD. AJ'S FACE 😂. KENNY THOUGHT RIO WAS IN AUSTRALIA.
DAAAAAANG chunkz put the 2 women and the american the last 3.... what u trying to say chunkz lol
Damn jasmine fine af
Bradley should’ve been in this video. But it would’ve been too easy because his 180 IQ instantly puts him at the top.
I have a feeling chunks won’t be doing a single challenge in next weeks video 🤣
Why they always trying to make beef with the strangers/make them uncomfortable, like be thankful they gave you content 💀
Ayo I know number one
Huh 160+ is a genius
chunkz thinks he slick
the funniest part has to be when he said "beta squad" in an american accent and it registered
Omg!!!!!can't wait for Saturday!!!!😭😭😭😭
If I had to rank I would say. 1. Niko 2. Chunkz 3. Sharky 4. AJ 5. Kenny
what's jasmine's @ tho
so what abby is smarter than einstein ?
No surprise the model is lowest lol. Most good looking people I know are dumb
judges say aks instead of ask and they judge
Her IQ is not 164. She couldn't even answer simple arithmetic. Also, drama major...
this is the lowest iq video ive ever seen
I literally just watched the Sumo video yesterday... what a coincidence
Jasmine fine tho
According to several female IQ rankings, Abby would've been top 8 smartest woman alive. That IQ Test, especially with another 150+ IQ guy and a perfectly average female ranking at 70 IQ seems very accurate.
AJ sniffed chunks and apparently he stinks lol, at 19:08  Noone clocked this 😂😂😂
Let's have the Beta Squad take IQ tests. I bet Niko would be the smartest.
sharky lookin like a real american with that accent
Why was this video kind of hard to watch? Love all their videos but did not really like this, felt very superficial and not nice, I don't know.
14:24
How does she have 164 IQ when she can't even do basic math?
Wish they showed the guys IQs at the end
Y’all need new ideas 😢
10:22
Chunkz Niko Sharks Kenny  AJ
Mark is a winner 😂
5:04
Water is warmer the lower u go and additionally the water pressure makes generates heat
226 is Chunkz answer 😬🔥
Y'all were rude af to D*ck!      I mean Rich!
im a absolute retard
wow...abby has a higher iq than einstein??? seriously what is she doing working in an office job doing customer service??
Loool when they said free the brothers
This video just made my day 10 times better😂
chunkz is def the smartest
Ain’t no way she got 164
is it just me or do they kinda ignore the women
Guys better drop Jasmines @
Maybe you guys should rank individually and see which one of you is closest to the right order and be a winner from the squad since, sharky seemed slightly upset because it was not his order and everybody in the squad has a different order in their head. So ranking, individually and finnally seeing who got it right can be fun too😉 And also by this, we can see who is actually the smartest beta squad member😂
The question is, what's considered smart by american standard? 😅😅😅
The girl with a 70 score is close to retardation!
11:10 HAHAHAH HIS AMERICAN ACCENT
10:35 The letter “S” is holding a lot of weight!
No AJ is dumb
What’s jasmines @ tho
Jasmine kinda cute not gonna lie
To be diagnosed as having mental retardation, a person must have an I.Q. below 70-75, i.e. significantly below average.
Nikos humour sets a world record for making everyone watching roll on the floor from laughter
“What do u know about combs u don’t need one”😭😭😭
An iq of 70 is crazyyy
9:58 is funny
i'm american and also offended from this
Hight IQ doesn’t mean that you are a Smart person or Intelligent Person… You can have a Higher IQ Level among 1 Million people and still don’t know how to cook food, build house, fix a car, history, politics, judging real or fake people and Social Intelligence etc etc … But A lower IQ person can cook or fix cars or build a house … etc etc …   And if you argue what’s IQ to do with cooking or building then you prove my point of High IQ being useless and That Hight IQ means nothing and it can be lower or Higher depending upon your knowledge or of your culture and history…
pew news music is crazy
Dick guy was violated
Niko and Chunkz sense of humor alone proves they have high IQs. I think they should be pretty closely tied
164  cap
Did anyone see an sniff chunkz and make a funny face ?💀😭
Anyone got jasmine’s @🔥
Beta squad over sidemen….that’s just facts
Jasmine anyone?
L ad
Obviously 1st, Niko 2st,Chunks 3rd,Sharky 4th, Aj 5th, Kenny
I think chunkz is really smart actually
did anyine else see aj smell chunkz at  19:07
my guess, from 2:00  1. Spiderman  2. Crop top 3. Baldy 4. Blue Sweater 5. Santa  6. Cheesecake
Argagah is here, trust me I'm not here to terrorise anyone
the moment i heard the highest IQ's value.. bruhhhhhh thats insane level
I’m late after that man City treble celebration 🍾 🎊 🎊 🎉 Any United fans who’s salty about us now and yeah also today you lost the bragging rights of that yesterday’s achievement 😂😂😂✌🏾✌🏾 PAINT THE CITY 🏙️ BLUE TODAY
They're all boring but I'm still watching just to see how it ends
NIKOS HUMOUR>>>
Jasmine is so fine
Asteroid ☄️ City 🏙️ 😂
5:10 🤌
24:15 I think niko is the smartest of all beta squad, then chunkz, then Aj, Sharky, Kenny
164??? Bro she's mensa level
Not y’all COUNTING THE LAUGHS!!!😂
I wanna see Beta Squad's IQ ratings. 🤏
beta squad iq line up for me is kenny aj sharky chunkz niko. aj is smarter than the avg person too i just think that beta squad generally has some very smart ppl
how do everyone know there iq what the fucks mine
“I thought it was rio” 😂😂
💀 5:18
No one can ever replace Niko 🤣
What kinda IQ test is this😂😂😂😂
Raise your hands if you didn't see all the videos I posted.
The way Sharky had to translate for the American guy 🤣
11:46 made me giggle a little too hard poo poo came out my ass
Don’t think they realise how exceptional that IQ is… It’s near enough the same as Einstein
iq of 70  how does she even function in normal society?  I get she is pretty, but with IQ that low she surely can't take care of herself.
I'm not a regular viewer, but I didn't liked to people who judged like the fact that they were trying to be funny on their names and face  NO HATE
How do they know their IQ unless everyone did the SAME iq? Are they just taking any online IQ test? I don't know
@Avocado
11:23 225
I miss these type of video
dont get education and iq mixed.
Naaah 164 is absolutely crazy even 152 is nuts
121, 144, 169. 196... ***205***
So Abby has an IQ of 164 ... she has more IQ than Albert Einstein !!!
IQ is a useless metric
1. Sharky 2. Chunkz 3. NIko 4. Aj 5. Kenny
Guess the imposter furry edition pls
These adds bro
Did you watch man city vs inter Milan
Chunck is the smartest
160 IQ is smarter than 99.999% of the population
Where is filly and harry
How tf shawty go to collage but don’t know how many letters in the alphabet 😂
Jasmin is bahd
70 means she has borderline intellectual disability. 69 and she would be mild.
Just for reference, 119 is average and above that is above average until 130-is classified as genius. 164 is an extremely high number and is probably in the less than 1-2% of the entire world
it sucks when they always try to be politically correct
i’m smarter then the ancient language coin collector
Humour 🔛🔝
Bro 164 is like Einstein tf
Jasmine a dummy
Kenny found his match
Chunks niko sharply Kenny aj
So who does actually have the highest IQ out of the beta squad? That would be an interesting video
Average global IQ sits at 100 70 is borderline mentally retarded, no really the US military wont recruit you at 70 IQ. thats what they deem to be "unworkable" lol 120+ youre liking at superior intelligence 150+ thats like 3 standard deviation from the norm.
She def doesn't have a 164  iq those online tests are not accurate and DRAMA uni nahhhh
Yo let's go!
150+iq is amazing
why are they being such aholes?
16:13 HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT COMBS YOU DONT NEED ONE 😭😭😭
niko got that poo outfit on man
For those who are wondering, they had actual iq tests and not one of these stupid online iq tests, Kane confirmed it himself in the comments section so, yes Abby and Danny's iqs were real, and turns out they actually are geniuses, and also, I would  like to let you all know that being bad at maths doesn't necessarily mean you have a low iq, you could be very good at some things and bad at others and that's the case with Abby here. I don't know why most people in the comments section don't believe Abby and Danny's iqs, and also, Having a high iq level won't get you famous to the extent that articles will be written about you online, some people with very high iq levels live and die without anyone knowing of their existence, and while it may be true that 164 is a very high iq level, It doesn't come close to the iq of the smartest human who ever lived which is estimated to be 220-230. I'm sorry but, It's true that Albert Einstein was very smart and all, however, most people overestimate his intelligence, there are a lot of scientists out there who are smarter than Albert Einstein, I find it kinda odd that most people compare a person's intelligence to his, Nikola Tesla had a higher iq than Albert Einstein's and invented A LOT of things and yet most people don't even know that much about him.  Have a good day!
AJ get back to the far left man😂
AJ carried this vid
Honestly I think that it is digusting judging people by what you call iq, if you where put in their shoes so would you probaly fall lowest by your standards but that does not mean that you are stupid since many of you have succefull careers, by doing this you leave them in a mindset that they are not enough and stupid or so will they get a sense of hybris that will in the end lead to their downfall where they might bring down others and dont even get me started about their way to the fall, honestly so should you be ashamed about what you are doing and you should apologise becouse everyone is smart in their own way and even if they dont reach your standards so is that something they are working on simply by just living and taking in the world, that is a stark contrast to you and your hatred to those you find dumber and below you, atleast try to find some peace in the world and  the creatures inhabiting it.  In short just stop the hate, I am a huge fan of beta squad and I hate not being able to watch one of your videos to the end becouse of the vile hatred spread throughout it
Having an IQ of over 144 is high in itself and the above average is around 115-144 if i recall. Beyond that, they're considered geniuses. Although having a high IQ doesn't necessarily reflect how someone would react in certain situations, thus the need of EQ and SQ tests to really be able to assess if someone is a true genius or not.
"HOW Y'KNOW ABOUT COMBS. YOU DONT EVEN NEED ONE" 💀
can we all just take a moment to appreciate how BETA SQUAD are clear from SIDEMEN, These lot have stepped up their content game
sorry beta squad but none of you are smarter than the average person
Lowkey might not watch any more Beta Squad. Chunkz really ain’t the vibe for me anymore
19:10 Why is aj smelling on chunkz like that ☠️
1st niko. 2md chunkz, 3rd sharky, 4th kenny, 5th aj
*SPOILER*can we just appreciate the fact 164 is a genius iq.. Albert Einstein’s iq was 160 so abbys iq is higher than his
Jasmin is rah cute someone get her socials for me
Top vid 🎉
For reference Elon musks iq is 155, and einsteins was around 160, there is no way that blue shirt women is that smart shed litterally be the smartest person living
Chunks got some nice teeth
no way her iq is 164 Albert einstein was around 160, furthermore elon is around 155, this is just some teacher
Well I think it’s fair to say we all want the reverse of this where strangers judge the beta squad iQ
Chunkz :”Abby any last words” Abby : “play the trailer  Niko after the camera stops rolling : *proceeds to pull out a 🔫*
Kenny said he thought the capital of Australia was Rio ??😂😂😂😂
Not the Pi and the alphabet. These guys are hilarious
Best on YouTube hands down
15:34 and 16:12 are two jokes/punchlines that the editors definitely should have edited better at least to share with us the guys’ contagious laughs 😂😂
😄😄😄😄🤩🤩🤩🤩 love tis,,,,,,,,,,,,, do more i
Beta squad shit on sidemen
164 IQ is Elon Musk level she couldn’t even do quick math. She majored drama definitely lied about her IQ. Should have made them do IQ tests in a room and have someone write down their IQ.
“My IQ is so low I don’t even know what that means” 🤣🤣 AJ is too funny
chunkz and Aj are smart af
11:07 ☠️
164 iq is more than einstein💀
ßälls
ß
i collect coins too, but i sure dosnt have more then a 100 iq
Jasmines @?
“How do you know about combs, you don’t need one”.😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂
Add the iqs of everyone in beta squad and they won't equal aa single persons lol
Get Jasmine in a blind dating
Einsteens IQ was only 160, shes a genius
He was wrong on Pi 😭
Nobody caught chunkz calling #3 Albert Einstein walalkiis?😭😭
Sharky is really the sexy silent type.
Last two makes sense. Minus fourth guys IQ by 20, third guys iq by 20, seconds guys iq by 45, 1st girls iq by at least 50 and you’ll have the actual iqs. No way anyone there is above 120 iq lol.
This would be my ranking from highest to lowest: Chunkz, Niko, Sharky, AJ, Kenny.
For the 2 Americans that said they went to college that is UKs equivalent of university
siz different pipuu and six different ciciiiss
Jasmine is fine as HELL oh my lord 😭😍
Jasmine’s @?
19:08 Aj😂😂😂
„He can‘t believe he came up with that one“ 😂😂
One thing Ik abt artists and musicians, they have a higher iq than most. I would’ve put her first the second she started talking abt her career
"Incorrectly" is not spelled incorrectly. Think about it.
Skinhead skinhead Oi Oi Oi
kenny last for sure
Kenny is right that yhan is leng the rash someone got the @
I'm at 13:50 and I can tell this girl is smart, she's just throwing out the wrong answers deliberately and not even pretending to think. There's no way she's actually trying
164 iq is crazy or 162 idk
AJ could leave Beta Squad and everyone would celebrate
Kenny has had far too many knocks to the head. I want to know his IQ.
Didn't see Sharkey talk once😢
"i thought it was rio" hahahahahhaahahhahahahahaha
sharky is smartest
Aj 😂😂😂 “my IQ so low I don’t even know if that’s good or not”
Chunks, Niko, Sharky, Aj, Kenny
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONEEE
My IQ is 149
I would have been second! That’s cool. IQ doesn’t mean anything tho rly lol
Next vid looks crazy and dam that model tho
Cant get over last weeks Harry cupid episode.
Imagine 5 white guys, rating 5 black guys based on look. Whole world would go into Chaos!!
Beta squad in their prime fr
12:15  Wtf is there any one don’t know that!!!!!!
Why is the screen so dark?
16:12 AJ is too funny😂
Cant wait for the next video. Its gonna be a banger
Ahmed
I liked rich
Dunning Kruger, smart people think they aren’t smart and dumb people overestimate themselves and think they are smart
i think the beta squad members from most to least smartest is; niko chunkz sharky  aj  kenny
Danny with the rain man stance
Chunkz Always carrying Beta squad 🦾🇸🇴
chunkz speaks a differennt language
I am so confused I swear Cain was in Footasylum guess my job as a fish seller (can’t remember how it’s called) and not as a coin collector
Daddy mujhse bola toh galti hai mere
The video without harry lowkey better
abby IQ = 164 ALBERT INSTEIN = 160
Soon as she said model, you just know
IQ ranking: Niko Chunkz Aj Sharky Kenny
Casual 152 IQ completely overlooked, like it is basic
“A bit of college” (O.O) 🤣🤣🤣
For context Einstein had an IQ of 160, and this lady has a one of 164…
Hi
Need jasmines @
Sharky got his own math question wrong lol Also the guy got only 5 digits of pi correct
I chose to watch this before MrBeasts new video 😅. Nice one Beta Squad 👍
Can we just appreciate that the woman had 164iq and Albert Einstein had 160iq.
If I drink I die if I eat I’m fine - that’s a Muslim ahlie 🤣🤣
Don't sleep on Mr 152 tho. That's crazy high!
Need jasmine @
AJ is bantsss brev! Why did he do Rich like that 😂😂
The irony.   A gaggle of morons trying to determine who is intelligent
Bro what the hell 164?.???
"How do you know about combs akh, you don't need one" THATS A VIOLATION 💀
I would like to answer the question 14:08’s in. A: Their Egos.
It might be a slur 😭
This should be good
jasmine is peng 😮‍💨
Beta Squad aren't smart enough to guess the smartest person. Funny though.
a cube... has 6 sides
Gorge bush senior not Biden dick lol 😂😂😂 how he gone tell a American who had to vote for him lol 😂😂😂
the videos are always a dub, but it's kinda wild when people tank intelligence and immediately go for trivia, like why would Albert Einstein know the capital of Australia 😭
but who’s coming soccer aid tho
These idiots have no idea how high the top two IQ were lol
Kenny looks diff
We all know chunks is by far the smartest 🤷‍♂️
Beta Squad the best icl
this is so fake bro her iq is not 160 and her iq is not 70 it does not check out 70 means you are mentally handicapped bro 160 means she is a top genius
14:20 , AJ face hahaha
She missed the chance to say "And this is the Ranking in reverse" at the end. Not that smart after all lol
16:12 how do you know about combs? You don't even need one. Aj's too funny 😂😂😂
Rating people on their IQ a very distasteful and unclassy idea tbh
164 IQ but cant do 26+13+5-9
I’m 12 and I knew every single question that they got wrong ngl they are all dumb
Chunkz's name is Amin?!
That trailer looks fire
Nah dis is some bullshit, there aint no way she has an IQ higher than Stephen Hawking
Kenny's question was so not needed
How did chunkz ask whose on the 5 dollar bill I swear he got that question wrong when they were trying to be American with actual Americans
NAHH I JUST GOOGLED AND EINSTEIN HAS 160 IQ
not to be sexist but i knew the model bitch was the last from the start lmao
IIIIIIIIIII think they lied. I don't think they realize how little the percentage of people that have below 85 and above 115 really is. Especially 164! No shot
kenny is so fine
164 iq but she put aj as 2nd smartest when he literally just said he has -63iq👀
Yo Kenny said 2s leng when aj confirmed he was getting married
I don’t think IQ is really a good measure of how intelligent someone is at all tbh
FIRST ONE LMAOOOO ALL DA TIME
the pi was just wrong
Abby is smarter then Albert Einstein
Another brilliant video, can’t wait for next week fr🔥😂😂
Yo imagine thinking that Rio is the capital of Australia 😂😂😂😂
Do these guys know how smart 164 and 152- iq is 🤔-which is smarter than the mighty einstine. Most engineers and doctors have iq of 112-123
OMMMMMMG THE TRAILER LOOKS INSANE
"Subscribe if your IQs is above 69"
Fun fact: Einstein had an IQ of 160
NICE VID
Imagine being ranked in IQ by these 😆 insult af
At 22:35  chunks is the only one with his jaw on the flor. And rightfully so. They have no idea how surreal this number is.
so you're tellin me abby is samrter than einstein and can't even do a simple math :D
Is this an old vid?
Its so funny how they make each other stupid😂😂
nico chunks sharky kenny aj
152 and 164 is mental
Let's just appreciate the fact that the guy in second place is a delivery driver but triples the average IQ in the lowest IQ countries
Bruh what's Jasmines @ ? Kenny was right she is lenggggggg
You got the line up numbers the wrong way round. It should go left to right
no she doesn't got a IQ of 164, so she wanna say she is smarter then Elon Musk or Albert Einstein...gtfoh
einstein iq was around 160 her iq is probably at 105
ngl the video is lit but 25 min is too long for this idea
Is either niko or chunks the smartest in beta squad....no way aj should be second
5:50  Aj you should respect elders you piece of gar bage
lesson: people are f*ckin' idiots
3:11-3:13 “he’s happy with that one HE CANT BELIEVE HE CAME UP WITH THAT ONE” 😂😂😂 nah these dudes funny af 🤣🤣🤣
"He's American, he's right" 💀
When she said 164 i jumped out of my seat if only the beta squad knew how ridiculous that it.
Lol the first 1:50 is hilarious 😂
164 and working at costumer service? Either the test is bs, she's lying or she has thrown away her potential.
The guy in third 7:37, swear he was in an footasylum video: guess the profession
164!! Thats wild smarter than Albert Einstein
164 IQ??
Video: we’ll be ranking strangers by iq  Also video: is will be a secret to us   🧠 💀
Mines 125, so im basically Cain
nah the trailer's looking madd 🤣 can't wait hey!
someone give me jasmine's @
That model got 70 something, thats borderline mentally retarded...
I'm pretty sure jasmine is dumber than some types of dog
Thank you Jesus, I couldn’t survive another week without a Beta Squad video!
This video had me dying lmao Niko we need more of you because you just aren’t enough
164 iQ is crazy and their reactions was meh 😂 she have iQ higher than Elon musk and Bill gates .
what's Jasmine's ig
Love nino
164 god damn that's like top 0.01%
Beta Squad IQ ratings 1st-  Chunkz 2nd- Niko 3rd- Sharky 4th- AJ 5th- Kenny
You guys are all naturally funny but its offputting when you disrespect people uneccesarily. I know the participants are paid to take part but you should treat folks with basic respect regardless. There's a difference between banter and bullying. The way you spoke to Rich was uneccesarily rude, especially as he's older than you.
70? ...
AJ is cringe
14:12 "I thought it was Rio" AJ looks at the camera in confusion 😂
nah bro you cant be serious with 164 wtf
When the american could'nt understand beta squad until it was done in the american accent killed me
10:49 since when does envelope have 1 letter in it?
IQ test only tests one part of intelligence. There are 3 I think
How is abbey’s iq more than albert einsteins
ur telling me abby has same iq as albert einstein
yall been fuckin killn it lately
i love you beta squad
wait, what are those scores... less than 1 in 100000 has 164.
Love the guys but the order definitely: Niko, sharky, chunks, Aj, Kenny
U trying to be funny but….
#FreeTheBrothers 😂🦍🙏🏽
Who’s got the models @? 👀👀👀
They are too concerned with looking nice, the whole point with putting the guy with the beard whos a amazon delivery driver was that it was meant to throw them off
Bro it goes like this: Chunkz, Niko, Sharky, Kenny, Aj
22:06 chunkz sounds young af here
I’m so excited for the next episode
man city just won... watching this video to cheer me up, lol
I swear Kenny has a sub 70 IQ
Sharky talking to the American in an American accents was incredible
Not the “how do you know about combs, you don’t need one” comment 😭😭
Jasmine was leng tho 👀
Whats jasmines @
Jasmin so cute
Shes leng
You all should do IQ test
I cant wait to see Niko and chunkz at soccer aid tomorrow :)
Niko talking to dick about come 😁😁😁😁
free the brothers🤣🤣🤣🤣
Did Aj just smell chunkz and held huis nose
8:39 chunkz has an amazing voice damn
Can we take a second to appreciate her IQ is stupidly high. Above 132 is genius. The giveaway was that she asked other people when she didnt know something, acknowledges she doesnt know the answer and finds the fastest solution
So you're telling me that Abby's got higher IQ than Stephen Hawking and Albert Einstein?!?!?
Stop scripting videos dawg😂
NIKO THE NEEK
but what if the judges are dumber than the contestants?
Lol , the panel have the lowest iq, deport
Beta squad this is a shit show, you better than this guys
Tbh, I don’t think her iq is 164
164 is bare high u know
Anyone got Jasmine IG?
W American dude 😂
No way top 2s IQ was that high
She did not say free the brothers 😂😂😂
Good job keeping the model stereotype alive 🤣
"How does he know about combs, you don't need one"  😂😂😂😂
I am gonna do IQ test now 😅
she got a first in drama she's good at acting she pretended to be dumb lol
Nice
"I wrnt to a special needs school" trust mine is a bit similar
Congrats to everyone Who is Early and Who found this comment
I pray Who ever Reads this Becomes succesful in Life
8:23-8:26
there best be a video ab you guys ordering each other and revealing ur IQs
Them sayin' that they are smarter than average person is mental 😂
I think for iq it would be chunks, niko,sharky, Kenny, and aj I feel like sharky and Kenny might be tied
YES
I'd love to see somebody rank beta squads iq
The model in the video is bad
the Niko dickriding is crazy in the comments
I wonder how they find people for these vedios.  how much do they pay them ???????
Never stop posting your videosss haha, they always cheer me up and make me laugh!! Your energy is unmatched and contagious :) thank you!
beta squad is going to disband eventually less "than 3 years"
Just realising the thumbnail (switching 3 & 4) is already in order 🙃
Missed oppertunity to bring Bradley in this
70 is craaazyyyyyyyyy
Nahhh that jungle ep looks madd! 👀 Very much looking forward to that upload!
congrats on the 6mssss
So in conclusion, models have low IQ
where do they find these people 💀
Never heard of this channel but im guessing muslims by name, maybe somali?
Ngl this video didn't bang
10:34 🤨
I dont care about her iq, jasmine is fine as hell.
I honestly love when chunkz shows his Muslim part
always  shouting
13:18 Despite that being the wrong answer, that was actually a really good attempt, and technically true.
I worked with Kane in Sainbury's. He was a team leader. Nice guy :)
no one talking about the guyhaving 156 iq
Shouldve had Filly here
nah chunkz #1
Nikos IQ at least 210
i would say chunks is the smartest
Let me get this straight…. It’s always about diversity but when it comes to IQ they don’t add any black people because they know black people statistically have the lowest IQ (intelligence) of any race.
rich is such a cutie
chunks  shoe choice is questionable..
I think in order or IQ for the Beta Squad from highest to lowest I'd say... Niko Chunks Sharkie Kenny AJ
The order imo: AJ Kenny Niko Chunkz Sharky (smartest)
This was actually very hard, thought I would be high with 144 but i'd only have been 3rd. Very good video lads.
Jasmines @?
My ranking is Shakky is first, chunks is second, niko is third, Kenny is forth and AJ is last😌
that ladys iq is higher than stepen hawking
152 is still absolutely genius level, the distinction between that and 164 is so hard to get
22:07 chunkz be sounding like a robot as well 😂
Niko is defo the highest iq
I think 164 IQ should have been smarter than what we saw
Sharkyyy?? OH MY! ❤😍😍
should disclose how their IQ was tested/calculated, 130 is the limit to join Mensa and its a high iq, so 152 and 164 sound bs.
So entertaining
Rank people based on something they don't know you're ranking them on
Chunkz is the most intelligent one out there but Abby was salty 😂
thanks for putting ads at the reveal hahaha
Sharky doing the American accent was today’s highlight 😂 and the consistency….. we love to see it! ❤
Rating handicapped strangers by ability to walk
Naaahhhh i want to watch the next videoo soo bad but im so scared of snakes that i just cant watch it 😢 great video guys always makin me laugh haha 🫶🏾💓
I thought it was rio😂
19:08 Ajay smelling chunks lol
another tuff watch, why are you guys so cringy. why do you over act so much , and why does shunkz have to show that he can sing every opertunity or not he can find.
yup,  yup yup yup yup
beta squad iq ranking prob: chunkz, niko, sharky, kenny then Aj?
CHUNKZ AT 13:55 ABOUTA SAY AUZUBILLAH THEN STOPPING HIMSELF GOT ME WEAK
I think the order is sharky,chunkz,niko,aj and kenny. smartest to dumbest
17:00 it's 33, not 35  nvm I was wrong
nobody talking about how he got the pie question wrong 3.14159😂😂
Missed opportunity to have filly
bro albert einsteins iq is 160 no way she has more einstein
how the heck you get 70 iq ? my iq is just average on a normal day. most days a little above very rarely below.
13:59 how can Niko say “a window” 😂😂😂
16:12 *the violation* 😂
So ability to answer general questions doesn't actually make you a higher iq
how high i think their iq's are: kenny < aj < sharky < chunkz < niko
NIKOOOOOOO MARRY ME haha
All should keep in mind that IQ tests are not actually a valid general messurement for intelligence, an IQ test definitly can be a hint but understanding what intelligence means and how to observe it and if it even can be put into a simple number is still a loaded and complex question with a lot of Scientists from the fields of psychology, philosophy to neurology still disagreeig on.
I liked this one so much 😂
You know what is also smart? Being kind to people and not rude!!!
Eye is technically correct as well
28 letters answer was crazy
16:11
@sharku
Beta Squad is taking over the british scene
Niko got his own question wrong😂😂 it’s not window lol
164 IQ?? How are they so calm about this😂
Anyone else feel blue balled we didn’t see the betas squads real IQ order?
hate button for Aj, two facing the man>>>
they should do one now with super models
Abby has a higher iq then Albert Einstein
I can't wait for the next episode 🤣🤣
So excited for next weeds vid it looks sick
I think darkest would have been a sick feature
All I wanna know is that if I got the maths series question correct
Niko is a sicko😂💯
YOU HAVE 6.15M SUBSCRIBERS WHO IS THE FRICKING FATHER
What was AJ doing at 19.06 😂😂😂
Bro 160 & 70, I’m speechless! 🤯
Of course the youngest is the most likely to be lowest. Brainwashed generation.
Finally I’ve waited it for 5 days
“How do you know about combs you don’t need one?” 💀💀
aj iq little like his height
No way she has a 165 IQ... she would be a super genius .......
I doubt 164 IQ I ain't gonna lie. it has a rarity of approximately 1/100000, and after approximately 140-145 IQ tests get vastly more inaccurate.
8:26 sharky trying not to laugh is gold
2:21
MARK HAS RIZZ FOR A MIDDLE AGED MAN
I am sure that all of them have low iq then 80 no just kidding 😂😂😂
did anyone else see niko sagging while sitting? his whole underwear is out bro 💀💀
They're probably using the Cattell IQ test which means you have to get 148+ to be considered top 2% while(or genius) while for the Stanford-Binet IQ test, the one most people are familiar with, top 2% is a score of 132+.
❤😂
Don’t know about those guys but these 5 are definitely dumb
There's absolutely no way they got two people with 150+ IQ there, thats like in the 99.99 percentile.
can’t wait to see niko and chunks tomorrow
After Niko called Rich, Dick, I literally got a Dicks sporting goods ad instantly at 11:46 😂
Zygote guy watched Henry danger before coming 😂
my personal rating: Niko, chunkz, sharky, aj, and last is definitely Kenny
"what do you know about combs, you don't need one"
19:08 u can see AJ smellin chunkz 🤣
6:46
Boring show today 😭
Abby being smater than Einstien (fact)
everyone wishes they had confidence like niko, he just says whatever he thinks and he doesnt care 😭
FYI the top two have a GENIUS level IQ. The lady might have a higher IQ than Einstein since his was estimated to be around 160
So Abby has a higher IQ than Albert Einstein.. sure
These kind of shows are boring please we don't wanna see guess the IQ or the part 1 shit
niko glazing = subhuman iq
sharky was so down this video you good bro
We still hate chunks or are we normal now
Beta squad should do more of IQ videos
That last part 😂😂
beta squad is the new sidemen funny and bright, sidemen are old farts who have ran outta ideas innit
11:07 the fact he only understood after sharky said it in an american accent killed me
Bro what the heck just because he has a smart stance
164 is insane but so is 70 🤣
Niko can’t stop telling jokes
Mark was mad funny
so the stereotype about the models is true then
It doesn’t matter how often I play it back I cant figure out what Chunks says after ‚,Albert Einstein…‘‘
20:42 Love to AJ for acknowledging the efforts to get a uni degree (3-5 years of study is straight pain)
nah they mustve used some clapped IQ tests, one of those online free ones cause 70 IQ on jasmine, i dont think 70iq can contruct sentences properly. 164IQ? nope.
Cringe fake IQ test :D
Calling someone a D is uncalled for. So rude.
She definitely does not have an IQ of 164. You can tell from the way she talks she's capped at like 110 on any valid IQ test
bullying strangers in the name of ranking them 💀
they be roasting them so hard fr.🤣🤣
😅aj would be -12333245655billion
‘How many members are in the BETTER Squad’🤣
hi
1. Sharky 2. Chunkz 3. Niko 4. AJ 5. Kenneth
Sharks said less in this video 😢
Niko Sharkey Chunks Kenny AJ
Beta squash never fails to make my day better
i love this
well if im gonna rank the beta squad member it would be  1.chunks  2.sharkiy 3.niko 4.aj 5.kenny  base on watching there videos "my opinion only"
13:55 Chunks Acudubillahi 🤣🤣😭😭
bro einstein had an iq of around 160. I call cap
You could see how this scene was reversed not even 100 years ago with white people judgding and grading black people lol.
I knew Kenny was sus. 2s a man
Cannot believe they got harry kane on here
bro all the question asked wasnt' required intelligence question(iq) but knowledge
got the same IQ as danny i had trust
Trailer is looking lit, great video guys 🔥
13:02 26
12:46 11 and negative 11
Australaisian 🤣🤣
"I think my I was around top 0.5% of the world" "the hell you doin in the beta squad"
11:32 yeah the answer y’all want is incorrectly, but incorrectly is spelt correctly so technically that’s wrong.
I do believe Niko is the smartest
11:23 225 Square numbers
YES
Nah y’all got pi wrong mr coin collector is stupid 💀💀 it’s 3.15159265359 and so on
164 is ridiculously high
Sharky's humour is underrated >>>
"6 different people of 6 different Intelligence level" old man walks on stage: oh nah.....
Knowledge and grades does not equal IQ.
“Man said delinkwik.”  😂
who else loves when beta squad upload  👇🏼
below 70-75, i.e. significantly below average. If a person scores below 70 on a properly administered and scored I.Q. test, he or she is in the bottom 2 percent of the American population10 and meets the first condition necessary to be defined as having mental retardation.  How’s this poor girl just admit to being mentally retarded
No way in hell does Abby has a higher iq than Albert Einstein
15:39 both of them got it wrong
Highest to lowest IQ Chunks Niko Sharky  Kenny AJ
they defo used some random online iq tests, caused aint no way shes got 164.....thats like higher than einstein iq, higher than 140 is like genius iq.....
The order has to be Niko, Chunkz, AJ, Kenny, Sharky imo 😅😅😅 idk man
I’ll go Niko, Chunkz, AJ, Sharky and then Kenny. They’re all smart but I think that’s how I’d rate them, based off of what I’ve seen in all the videos I’ve watched.
"how do you know about a comb, you dont need one" 💀
This concept is amazing
19:09 did he smell him and he stinks? 😮😮
Beta Squads videos just keep getting better and better!
my beta squad ranking : 1-chunkz,sharky,kenny,niko,aj(may swith between kenny and niko)
i swear down if chunkz doesnt do any of those challenges in the next beta squad vid imma be mad disappointed
Good video.
1.Niko 2.Chunkz 3.Sharky 4.AJ 5.Kenny
DJ Bigshot the GOAT
The humour and banter in this episode was top tier! Never laughed so much while watching an episode 😂😂😂 loveeed it!
1niko 2chunkz 3sharky 4aj 5kenny
i fell bad 4 rich tho... he was thrown down the bus, fr.
Finally a good video after vulgar dating show and wipeout failure
7:51 “I have 🤓☝️”
Always tryna get people to say the n-word oms😭💀
Danny carried😂
Did anyone else notice Chunkz and AJ were in sync at 6:44
I’m fairly sure the IQ test taken was not a proper one because to have such high IQs, 164 and 150 is ridiculously high.
Thank you for having me! Was a wonderful time and had allot of fun - Cain
i felt so bad for rich 😭
how can you have an IQ of 164 but struggle to answer basic knowledge questinos?
Hello
Dang danny be looking like a mad genius
I would say chunkz Niko Sharks Aj and kenny
this video is a testament that iq tests are bullshit
Bro , top 2 are in a Genius category fr
The IQ level of the last girl seems highly unlikely to be 70. If her IQ were indeed 70, she would be categorized as having an "Intellectual Disability." However, based on her articulate speech and behavior, it appears improbable that she falls within that category.
My ranking : niko , sharky ,chunkz , aj , kenny
um... isn't 70 like ACTUAL rtrd ? Like, not the insult, an actual medical condition? She is leng, fair enough but fuck me... 70?!
abby has a higher iq then albert einstein
Did they just forgot Kenny said he thought Rio was capital of Australia
Reticent: not revealing one's thoughts or feelings readily.
I don’t know if someone said it but…. Eye could’ve also been a correct answer right?😅
Beta squad putting 40 seconds of unskippable ads near the end
So ig it’s not a stereotype then
Lmaooooo, Niko is the ultimate troll
The way they turned around their chairs shows beta squad together have -1 IQ
Disrespectful Triangle Prick.
Model ig?
Did any1 see the way Aj looked at kenny after he said the capital of Australia was rio 😂😂14:19
I’ll just say this the next video on Saturday chunks is gonna be tapping out the first 😂😂😂
Y’all need to bring back Kane for some coin rares video. Guess the value!
I laughed well at this😂😂😂
the order should be: Niko, chunks, sharky, kenny and aj
Model stereotype keepin strong
u guys ask the most immature brain dead questions lmao
Banger of a video but I highly doubt the IQ of the winner is in fact 164. There are about 250'000 people with an IQ higher than 160 in the whole world so the chances of finding such an individual are extremely low. Even the score of 152 is pretty much close to genius level for the person that placed second. Fair play if the scores are actually real tho.
You know its a good day when you see Beta Squad upload.These saturday uploads are perfect.W vidd
Anyone got Jasmine's Instagram?
19:07 watch AJ 😂😂 this man never stops joking
11:27 when aj said beta squad in an American accent and he finally understood it I cannot cope😂😂 are we really that not understandable 😂
14:20 I thought it was rio🤣🤣🤣
11:10 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 When I tell you I scream laughed.. literally CACKLED at sharky putting on the American accent💀 and the fact that the guy clocked what they were saying after that. im fucking hollering
Feels like these iq numbers r inflated, i mean all iqs test r wrong we dont have the optimum actual proper iq test, cuz anything above 140 means a person has a very deep and complex fhinking and anything below average means a person lacks basic abilities such as being able to understand some difficult theory and no way jasmine iq or marks iq is 70ish and 88 the range from highest to lowest is to high imo
I AM SO EXCITED FOR THE JUNGLE SERIES
spoilers          164 iq!!!! ,  Albert Einstein had an iq around 160! she is a god damn genius. only (. 003%) 1 out of  30,000 individuals has iq above 160. i don't think you will meet another person with that iq value again!
s
Yo bruddaz keep this up you guys are mad tings bro
Do an iq test episode with final results!!!!
i can tell mark is a millionaire, time to find out at the end
The order (From smartest to possibly mentally challenged) Chunks > Sharky > Niko > Kenny > AJ
Was really hoping they got someone with a outrageous Scottish accent and sent them to back imediatly
Order should've been Kenny, Aj, Sharky, Niko, Chunkz
I'm amazed that not one of you guys clocked what she said before you made the final decision.  She got a first... "Only in drama".   Major red flag right on the final moment. 😅
It's a shame she wastes her high IQ in customer service. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I worked there myself for years, maybe that's why I think it's a shame.
164 IQ my ass
164 ??? Higher than Albert?
Dumb, dumber and a waste of time
The list Chunkz, Niko, Sharky, Kenny, Aj
There is no way these IQ tests were legit. 70 is literally like mentally disabled and above 150 (1st and 2nd place) is extremely gifted and are less than 1% of the population.
I like how he was wrong about pi after 3.1415 but didn't even notice
nah aj gotta be on the end of the line
Chunkz having the lowest IQ is crazzyyyyy
i dont like that question made me laugh for two mins straight
Big up Abby and Rich
NIKO IS WAYYYYY TOO SMART LMAO
I don’t why I feel bored watching this
Put darkest in the beta squad he is the missing piece
10:50 he is right Eye has two Es and one letter ‘I’
Sdmn is defo better , all beta squad do is copy jubilee
how is kenny not dead last????
Don’t judge a book by its cover guys!!!!
Chunks took AJ's spot there😂😂 aj shouldn't even be on the podium.. his IQ should be no where near that room😂😂
Who is the model?
How did Chunks forget that Aj has 100 teeth at the top and 6 at the bottom jaw
I would rather watch beta squad than the sidemen all day long. even though they are both good. Beta squad get many more giggles outa me !!
Yoo! Kane is NewGametag right ?  The coin collector 😮
I’ve always been a fan of the sidemen from day 1 but recently I’ve found I’m choosing a beta squad video over a sidemen video a lot more. Just feel like beta squad are focused more on what people would find entertaining and sidemen seem to just be going on holiday with a camera…
Niko and Chunkz are for sure top two in order of iq I think lmao
bruh he said eye
1. Niko 2. Chunkz 3. Sharky 4. AJ 5. Kenny
Aj and Niko are jokes 😂😂😂
For those who dont know an iq of 164 is extremely impressive. The average person has about 100 iq and anything over 135 is considered genius. Just to put it in perspective Einstein was speculated to have an iq of around 160 which would mean that Abby in terms of raw intellect should be on par with Albert fucking Einstein.
Kenny look like tyler the creator
Kenny always trying to move to girls
These guys are muppets fr, regret watching these bellends

Just make Chunkz the narrator for next weeks video😂
reticent adjective not revealing one's thoughts or feelings readily. "she was extremely reticent about her personal affairs"
Isn’t 225 the answer for the “what number logically follows this series” which is about perfect squares
The model is certainly living up to the stereotype
Uploading on a saturday….
danny on top
@chunkz this guys laugh kills me bro
HAAHAHAHAHAHAH BRO FROM WHAT SEWERS DO THHEY PULL THESE PEOPLE MAN
"How do u know abt combs, u don't need 1"😂🤣💀

lmso
Sharky doing the American accent 😂😂 bela squad
how's the ginger girl is the smartest and she was literally asking the tall bald dude for answers? makes no sense🤣

Abby is 169 and Sthephen Hawking is 160  yeah not sure about that  she couldn't do a simple math equation
Those IQ'S are wild 😂 What kind of Buzfeed tests did they take
8:39 that riff from Chunkz be crazy🥶
Low cost "studio"

They only swapped number 3 and 4 in the thumbnail 😂
a person with 164 IQ is found 1 in about 35000 people. And Im not saying shes not smart, but I just dont believe that a 164 IQ level person is just doing basic administrative work and customer service.
AJ smelling Chunkz 19:08 was a straight vio, grabbing the nose after too.. dead
6:12 “how do you know about combs you don’t need one!” got me laughing bro 😂
This one was funny 😂😂
can we all agree that chunkz is not doing next weeks video
#1 Niko #2 Chunks #3 Sharky #4 Kenny #5 AJ 😂😂
Kenny saying he thought the capital of Australia was Rio at 14:24 has to be the most shambolic thing i have heard. Its not even in the same country. Best beta squad member though and most underrated.
Chunkz acting like he’s got an extra chromosome this episode
160 iq e non sa fare due addizioni in mente?
WHAT IS THE VALUE OF PI LIL MABU:3.141592653589793238
0 % boring  100 % entertainment
“How’d you know about combs you don’t need one” VIO AJ 😭😭
Anyone see the camera tilt when it said what comes up and never comes down
only thing that's keeping me alive during exam season are these videos. love you guys!!
Tbh i think for the highest to lowest IQ would be Niko, Chunkz, Sharky,Aj and Kenny last. Still not sure between Niko and Chunkz bcos they both pretty smart
Now that you guys have reached 6million subs - do the big reveal!!! Who’s having a baby😂
Big up jasmine for showing up, many won’t.
I'm honestly preferring BETA SQUAD over SIDEMEN these days 😶‍🌫 The video ideas are just so much more creative here!
Me cringing when they said pi 😅 3.141592653589793238462643238 is all I know.
You guys are making more entertaining content than the sidemen
Chunks iq will be the highest in beta squad
Abby def cheated on that IQ test lol
you should do a 6 genuis vs 1 beta squad member video
Order of smartest to least, i think it goes..... Chunkz, Sharky, Niko, AJ and then Kenny
this is the first time I dislike some video. those guys are annoying
Ayye chunkz said my ñame lol Albert 😅🎉
please do more mafia vids
I.Q isnt accurate, its a basic test of human levels. Which someone with 54 could actually be more intelligent than a 90.
18:24 chunkz has take loads
16:12 THAT WAS A VIO
i swear they always get at-least 1 fit girl
L
Bruh the "HA(X10)" is cracking me up for some reason
Why have we still not found out who is the dad 😢
my IQ is relatively high but i am one of the stupidest people that i know lmao. that number doesn't mean too nuch.
24:00 looking really familiar to the old guys watchin ay? 👴(jk)
These videos make my whole week 🥰❤
The way Sharky is looking at Jasmine at 22:11 ... haha
I say #3 has the highest IQ before the video ends
70 iq is literal down syndrome
Soon as she put out there that her degree was in ‘Drama’ I knew it was her, she was acting the whole time, fair play
This comment will remain undiscovered
SHARKY'S ANSWER WAS WRONG THE ANSWER TO HIS MATH QUESTION WAS 34 I THOUGHT I GOT IT WRONG
Can U please pin it's my BIRTHDAY AND IM SUBSCRIBED
23:12 “I don’t have an IQ .. just a Q by itself” -AJ 2023 lmao💀💀
“i thought it was rio”  That’s on the other side of the planet😂😂
19:10 terrible question
14:11 the camera moving down got me
AJ is the most un-funny and annoying guy on here
Sharks with the accent 😂😂😂
Who is the father
Beta squad is comedy gold 😂
11/9 next to american guy…
Models are indeed dumb lol
Niko’s def the smartest
10:45 thats actually not dumb, he said eye, which if you say it, its 1 letter (y)
Thank you beta squad for the constant entertainment
let's take a moment of silence to appreciate how GOODLOOKING kenny looks with his facial hair
Lady : Freeman Brothers Beta Squad ; Free the Brothers 👏👏
That IQ test they did was not accurate at all 😂😂 Abby does not have the same IQ as Einstein and 70 is considered to be mental retardation so Forest Gump level
I would have arranged it Kenny,Aj,snarky,niko and chunkz
10:46 i said E........i mean he didn't say it had to be a word.
You guys are the definition of entertainment.
Chunkz is so cringey
"I thought it was rio" kenny yeahhhh
Who is the parent
Damn imagine being in last place for something like this
When the american guy didn’t understand “beta squad” it was so funny😂
Next week's video looks insane, very excited.
12:21 AJ thought he done something 💀
Niko just carries
How does Abby have a higher in than Albert Einstein 😂
14:22 Narh, kenny thinking Rio is the Capital of Australia is crazy💀
164?!? Hell no. What type of clarted iq test did they take?! That's legit above Einstein
Kane really just lied about pi and got away with it
a BETA squad IQ test video PLEASE
WE NEED MORE DROPS NOW !!!!!
IQ has nothing to do with having facts and data memorized lol
Editor forgot to turn up the exposure
rich saying "i dont like that question" was quality
16:11 AJ did him dirty💀
Did they actually put the accurate ranking in the thumbnail 😭😭
That's BS people with IQ under 80 can't make proper sentence, world average is 100 if 2 lowest made it up how I am supposed to believe that rest didn't made it up just for content?
Beta squad are way better than sidemen,they are all so genuine with everything they do there great💯
you guys went hard on Rich 😥
If the subs rated the biggest pricks in beta squad Chunkz would be the the biggest prick
16:12 chunks vio 😭😭😭
I dont like that question 😂😂
next weeks basically ima celeb vid looks unreal cant wait
Not people actually thinking iq is an accurate measure of intelligence
"We got the owner of Facebook here" 😭
did they realy let australasia slide?
I can’t imagine someone saying: “Hey you look dumb”😁
bruh einstein's iq was around 160 no way these 2 are around his level of intelligence
Nikos humor is always on top
Aj is dumb so no no offence ily all of u sorry aj
He got pie wrong 😭
Why they asking American questions
should've had the genius bradley😂
Chunkz never heard of the dunning kruger effect
164 us higher thsn einsteins iq
this was fun, next episode will be crazy fun!
ayo whats 2's @
14:12 Alternative: Helium balloon unless it pops
You lot are peaking in your YouTube careers
Can’t wait every week to get a new beta squad video
Sideboys fell off beta squad up now
is noone gonna metion how sharky gave the wrong answer to the us president one😭😭joe biden wasnt the president in the 1990s it was bush and bill clinton
Free the brudda 😹😹😹😹😹😂😂😅
1h ago!!!! :D
Bless jasmine thank god she’s good looking
ok when is the beta squad iq results coming though?
Lowest iq to highest is Kenny Aj Niko Chunkz Sharky
Bring them back and have them judge the Beta Squad's IQ
I swr jazmine’s from Ipswich
Sharky translating “how many members are in the Beta Squad?” had me weak 😂😂
My ranking would be 1.Niko 2.Chunkz 3.Sharky 4.AJ 5.Kenny
Abby's 164 IQ is shocking, she might have a higher IQ than Einstein's himself with Einstein having a estimated IQ of 160
I wish IshowSpeed could participate then we'd surely know who is the dumbest
How did none of them clock Kenny said he thought the capital of Australia was Rio.
They are dicks.... unbelievable
bro this channel is becoming the black jubilee
love this typa content from ya guys
Chunks 🫶🏾
Ahhhhh my boys are back 😌😌
There’s no way she has a 70 iq  Which test did she take
I think the order should be Chunkz, Nico, Sharky, Kenny & AJ👉👈
anyone else see some of chunckyz bunda
order - 1st : Niko 2nd: Chunkz 3rd: Sharky 4th: Kenny 5th: AJ
the IQ test must be from Ohio
Wallahi i love thé beta sqaud their so funny omds
Aj can't be the second smartest
I like these vids but defo need to actually go outside for a video 😂
Yeah Niko is the smartest followed by sharks then Kenny then chunkz then Rat   You agree ?
Average IQ is 100
Over 130 is already MAD
Ain't no way aj had to do an American accent for him to understand 😭
164 iq??? thats literally albert einstein level
Wow. The thumbnail is almost the exact order they end up as in the end.
finally, a video with all of you
My favourite yt chanel to watch
I don't believe Abby's iq is 160. That's literally around Einstein iq
The Asians were too busy running businesses and being doctors to come to the shoot
Some of the questions were too targeted 🤣🤣
Chunkz wild for that 😭💀
Zygote had me...😭💀💀
One day, ima be big like you lot. Just watch ✊🏼
Can't wait to watch the next episode like 😂😂 AJ my man screaming like that😂😂😂
Order is Niko, Sharky, Kenny, Chunkz, AJ
The only reason Kenny asked their names is to find out Jasmine's pffft thinks he slick.
Bro they tested their general knowledge to rank them by iq 💀💀, ig they were the lowest iq in that room
Where are the Asians?!
Where's Einstein at?
Claim your “here before 1,000,000 views” 🎫 👍🏼
Eye was a better answer than envelope
You just know this video is going to be a banger 🔥
Beta squad is unmatched
this has to be wrong, Einstein's iq was 160
Next video seems like a BANGER!!
why's noone focusing on the fact that she has a higher IQ than einstein damnn
What iq test is this?? The average is inflated by 2 standard deviations —>basically it sucks.
16:13 🤣🤣
I love how their soul purpose is to offend people 💀
i need the next video to be like an hour long
Ummm Abby would be in the 99.9992 percentile of people in the top 0.0008 percent, not sure the iq test checks out but great video nonetheless
sharky should be first then niko then chunkz then aj and then Kenny imo
off topic but we need another collab with trent pleaseeeee
11:11 I love how as soon as Sharky speaks in an American accent the american guy finally gets it
Yoooo im early
Jasmine's @?
Yoo next week gonna be wild 🔥🔥👏
0:56 bro's not wrong  what's her @?
early (kinda)
How in the logic is putting chunks at last?😂😂😂
The guy on the end looked like he wanted to bang Kenny in the face for his judgement on him😭
No
Please like the video so more people will see this masterpiece 😆Special props to AJ's intuition about Abby 😍👍
i love you beta squad
Beta squad with other banger
I swr I would watch a day in the life of Niko he's so effortlessly funny😂
Niko Chunkz Sharky  Kenny  AJ.....I believe that's their IQ arrangement😂
Would love to start seeing bigger idea for videos boys
no chance is she 164 with Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking at around 160... what is she the smartest person in the world?...
so glad that one time beta squad almost stopped and they didn't
11:11 sharky is too funny
Why yall gotta put an ad right before the reveal though😭
YES WAITING FOR THE SYD VID 🤲🏾👏🏽
1st?….. 😭
according to chatgpt:   Below 70: Intellectual disability (formerly referred to as mental retardation) 70-84: Borderline intellectual functioning 85-114: Average intelligence 115-129: Above average (often considered bright or high average) 130-144: Gifted or highly advanced 145 and above: Very gifted or highly advanced
Saturday is a good day! This is why:
5:45  Webs got snaked by a rat.
"Why do you know so much about combs, you don't need one" is such a big violation (cuz hes bald)
these guys are not only disrespectful, they're also supremely unfunny :/ it's a shame to waste our time and the time of the contestants. i hope they were well remunerated
Whose most intelligent among better squard??
That woman's iq is lhigher than Einstein's coz his was around 160, average = 100, gifted = 115, boundary genius = 140
these videos r acc insane keep it up
Abby has the iq of 164 WHILE ALBERT EINSTEIN HAS THE IQ OF 160 SOMETHING 😭😭
I don't know how that Model finnesed them, Models are dumb A.F 😂
Where did they these IQ numbers from, the smartest one would be considered above albert einstein and the least smartest likewise to a dog
Girl is leng indeed
do you accept dick? “i don’t like that question” LMAOO
Niko and Kenny are smart So Niko first Kenny second Chunkz third Sharky fourth Aj shabeel 😂😂
the ego on this panel is crazy
jasmine's @?
Beta Squads comment section is full of the biggest NPCs and bots
Exited for next week! Maddd 🔥🔥
Everyone knows the actual order is  Niko Sharky Chunks Kenny Aj
16:12 they violated him 😂
W vid
Bulshit never ever play humans like a game 😡
Niko 😂😂😂
9:05
If Kenny has an iq above 85 I'd eat my foot.
😂❤
wtf the range of 164 to 70 xD one has einstein level iq and the other has to be reminded to breath
70 ????? My dog has more cmon girl
The ad placement is crazy
The cobwebs on elbows was crazy man haha
lowkey eye starts and ends with e and has one letter in it  10:45
Hi yall I’m coming Trafford centre tmoz I’m SO EXCITED IM YOUR BIGGEST FAN ❤❤❤❤
as a beta squad expert this is the definitive IQ rankings: 1.Chunkz 2.Niko 3.Sharky 4.AJ 5.Kenny
10:50 Letter E
What a dick move on AJ with the business card and than y’all put a fake ad on the screen. cold for that
It's  Chunkz Niko  Kenny  Sharky  Aj
No way she has an iq higher than Einstein (reportedly) and can’t do year 4 level maths
What’s jasmines @
Beta Squad to 8M this year😤
164 is genius level einstine level
I was dying at 19:05 when AJ was smelling chunkz
9:09 Chunkz 😂😂😂
Obviously Niko is d smartest
im way smarter than an average person - top 2percent in the uk
Why is nobody talking about the trailer😮
there all african so they should all make it out
I don’t have IQ just a Q 😂😂
0:43  Chunkz spoke somali and roasted that old man🤣
She the same iq as Albert Einstein
16:11 why did chunks have to violate him like that 😭
Niko man too good
Niko and aj are the best
Nikos trim is dead
Beta Squad’s content is just getting better every time..
those iq numbers aren’t accurate at all lol. 160 is stephen hawking level, and 70 is mental retardation
bruh these guys took online iq tests and believed it lol 162 puts you in 0,004% of humans lol your iq would be so high youd graduate college at 15
Chunkz to the girl: "So you're not smarter than the average person" 22:07🤦🤦 (Btw I guessed she was ranked the lowest when she said she was a model at 3 minutes in)  Is it just me or are they always a bit too mean to strangers or am I just too "soft"?🤔🤔
can we just appreciate the fact 164 is literally a genius iq.. i loved the smartest persons tactics too lmfao
Hallo
To be honest not the best beta squad video hope the next one is better
Don't know if I believe Abby's IQ is 164. What IQ test did they take? She's supposed to be smarter than Stephen Hawking?
sharky looks so good in sweaters oh my GOD
BETA IS DEFINITELY THE BEST YOUTUBE GROUP
is it just me or does kenny look like tyler the creator
Why is everyone in the comments d riding Niko
Finally baseball team uploaded another banger 🎉
niko , chunks, kenny ,sharky , aj ---- thats my order
11:35 NO WAY HE SAID ZYGOTE 😭😭😭
Niko's humor 😂
Levelling up every video ❤
They all lied about their IQ at the end😂
16:38 i said 2 just as she did, crazy
What this video needs is for the Beta Squad to actually do a test and throw up the numbers, kinda left it uncomplete...
They all messed up pi
How does the girl have 160+ iq and cant solve easy math questions thats cap
10:12 chunkz pull ya bloodcaat trousers up
Kenny thought Australia’s capital city is RIO 😂😂😂 and then he asked what language is ancient  hahahah
Niko, Chunkz, Sharky, AJ, Kenny for me
Kenny looks so old.. & skinny what happened..does having a baby change him that much, he aged a lot so fast?? He is in his 20s right??
Can we all just understand that Einsteins iq is about 160 and Elon musk's is 150-155
niko is definetly the smartest
kenny could never be above average
IQs i recon: lowest - highest: Kenny, AJ, Sharky and then Chunks and Niko close first
This video was dead. After their "comeback" these man have become complacent
I might be going nuts but isnt an iq under 85 considered mental retardation???
The fact that niko is right or wins almost all the time makes things get really boring on Beta Squad 🤷🏽‍♂️😅
They’re going to the jungle😂😂😂😂
niko is the best ❤
11:10 Sharky being the translator for the american was hilarious
Nahh i think chunkz has the highest IQ, then Niko, then Sharky and im torn between AJ and Kenny for last place 😂
nice that you let abby rank you guys at the end
11:08 nah when sharky had to repeat the question with an american accent that was so funny 😂
i dont think that woman has a score of 164. from the video, she seems to have about an average level of intellect (85-115). Anything over 145 is considered near genius or genius. 164 is in the 99.999th percentile and is considered a "high level genius". apart from that this video was a banger
I think some IQs here were exaggerated or based on an inaccurate online test. An IQ of 160+ is like 99.999% (yes including those decimals) and is on a level with brilliant scientists like Hawking and Einstein. The same goes to 70 IQ which is close to mental retardation.
I am early
This the content we love keep it up 👍🏾
Danny HELLA underrated
Niko has the most confidence I have ever seen!
Beta squad early upload?
nah but jasmine what you sayin
ok, i understand the lineup, but the iq ratings are deinitely not accurate
Niko Chunkz Sharky AJ King Kenny
Niko is beyond anything i could ever imagine.
WALLAHI ON MY LIFE I WAS WAITING FROM Wednesday for u guys to upload cuz like without u guys my days are dead and dry 😭
NAHH BC WHEN SHE PUT CHUBKZ AT LAST PLACE WITH THE LEAST IQ 😭😭😭
First 2 are geniouses
SHARKY AT 13:55 OH MYY
I just already know Niko's winning next week
The Pi one was wrong wasn’t it 😂
11:00 love how the american guy understood the question after Sharky said it in his accent 🤣
Mate beta squad will never get old
It's not Sunday brother
chunkz and niko definitely gotta be a close tie on IQ's
didn't expect that twist of yall asking abby to arrange yall in turn 😂 oh chunks.. at least, baby gyal put my niko first 🤭 the trailer for the next vid looks mental and dope.. can't wait and don't forget to leave them a like and a follow my friends; loving their consistency 🚀
These videos are just 4 guys waffling and NIKO being a comedic sarcastic genius
Niko is definitely the smartest Beta Squad member
Smartest to dumbest   Smartest 1.)niko 2.)chunks 3.)sharky 4.)Kenny  5.)AJ Dumbest
i thought this was gonna be awkward but it was actually pretty wholesome lol. mostly cuz chunkz loosens the vibe.
her iq is not higher than albert einsteins 💀
Best group in UK say that I'm wrong
12:56 man sharky is beautiful
Im gladyoureback
Wasn’t surprised when jasmine said she’s a model, she’s beautiful
4:08 nice Niko 🤣
16:13 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHA AJ
Bro Is a sumo guy
Sorry I was not able to compete in this video due to country barier🙏🙏🙏
Another vid of chunkz being a massive L adding nothing but negativity too the vid
nikos bare funny man
“Free the brothers” AINT NO WAY 😭😭 AJ said that
How did you find a 160 iq human wth
Oh how the quality of these videos have improved. This looks like an actual game show
at 21:10 you can see Chunkz Underwear 🤣🤣
Albert Einsteins IQ is estimated at 160, abbys IQ is 164 but she works in customer service?
w video
Damn Abby's 164 IQ is really fucking high, its like the top 0,0001%
as soon as i see a new beta squad video i click immediately
11:37 HELP WHAT
11:20 225
I love you guys but calling a man who’s as good old as your father a d*ck is not nice icl. Lost respect
Next vid finna be busain
Jasmine straight lied. The average IQ is 100. 70 is moron level 😂😂😂.
yay hola from Canberra
IQ of 164 is higher than hawkins and einstein
the woman has an IQ higher than einstein???
11:10 SHARKY KILLED MEEEEE
Love them for hyping Niko up 8:42
Niko’s confidence and kenny making comments about everyone and getting everything wrong is crazy
this and champions league final in the same day what a day
did they take like a random IQ test from the internet because 75 and below is actually considered to be intellectually disabled. the average IQ is about 90-110. the only way to find out person's IQ is by doing series of tests done by a psychologist.
Early😂
i like how they dont all fit around the table 😭
They don't seem to realise how smart 164 IQ is. That's wild.
Beta mega squad❤🎉
1 hour mark!😂🎉
1-  chunks 2-kenny 3- sharky 4-niko 5-AJ. I think that’s their IQ order 👍
The pi hguy is wrong it isn't 3.141567 it's 3.1415967
I had the same arrangement except for danny and cain
they should've featured beetlejuice
Just off of banter alone, it's gotta be *honourable mention* Darkest, Chunkz, Niko, AJ, Kenny, Sharky =x i'm so sorry Sharky you barely speak bro.
Once again Chunkz is in Sliders what's the matter don't his fat feet fit in trainers 😂
Niko is definitely the smartest
Jasmine is beautiful
4:44 😂 honestly Niko never disappoints
Lol what a banger
Lol 😂
Niko in every vid🔛🔝
Damn and I thought my 149 IQ was impressive.
Anyone know where I can buy the jacket Kenny is wearing?
For anyone scrolling thru the comments whole watching, the red haired woman is the smartest. I hope I ruined the video for at least one of you :)
Yeah Niko is the smartest
Ah was waiting for the video ❤
wait... how was her Iq 164 but she couldn't get that super easy math question
The guy in the flannel had the coldest light skin stare😂
Guess why there is any black 😂😂
its impossible that Abby's IQ is so high. Albert Einsteins IQ was around 160. So you are telling me that someone who did drama in school and works in an office has a higher IQ than Einstein. I won't even talk about a delivery driver with the same IQ as Elon Musk...
Chunkz’ humor is lowkey father like 👀
Everybody’s loving Betasquad vids and hating on Sidemen’s these days
There is no way those iqs are right, 164 and 152 are huge anomalies bruh what test did they take to get these results
07:15 what the flying fish is that goofy ah reaction !!
The incorrectly question is so stupid considering all words are spelt correctly
Abby's IQ is the same if not more that the one of Einstein
My iq is 41
CHUNKZ really has been putting in the work, he has lost quite a lot of fat. Keep it up CHUNKZ 🎉 proud of you bro 💪💪💯
Also I wanna see Manchester City lose today , God Please 🙏🏼
I did an IQ test and they cant accuratly measure it because it was above 160 so thats kinda cracked ngl
16:10 AJ did him dirty 💀💀
Jasmin kinda. . .
I had my money on white beard guy, special needs school be having some lowkey geniuses and I'm ngl I had abbey LAST lmao wtf a first in drama doing customer service what the hell
14:15 😂
Nice video as usual. Can't wait to see nxt week video. ❤❤❤🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
10:46 He's actually right! Eye starts with E, ends with e and can be spelt "I", which has 1 letter!!!
ima need jasmines @
However someone can't describe themselves with one word
niko is funny and confident af
that thing at the end where abby arranges it was great <3 i agree with that order too!
What’s Jasmines insta
Yooooo beta squad has a new vid cool!
Nahh Kenny really just asked their names
164 iq is crazy high
love da vids
I hope Chunkz is ok cos hes been off the last few vids ❤
no wayyy did kenny say rio was the capital of Australia
2 minutes in and this ain’t it
All I see is Dick riding in comment
W video always man
Niko and AJ are too funny man. Love the beta squad videos
6:06 HELPPPPP
Why are low IQ people in the negatives ranking other peoples IQ’s?
Please keep subtitles on your videos. We do long shifts looking after my father and we keep the volume down the captions are not always correct. Thank you for the little things ❤
Wow how are there so many bots
Ain’t no way her iq 70 she must been purposefully trying to fail
Chunkz is definitely not doing next week videos 😂😂😂
5:11IS CRAZYYYYY
5 members ????? Wabou filly fam, nah wait this is an amazing shit
Aj the most sarcastic man I have ever seen 😂😂
Jasmine got insta?
IMO, this should of been judged on academic results, IQ is not an accurate measure of intelligence.
4:49 HAHAHA
IM SO EXCITED FOR THE JUNGLE VID
The real genius is the person who uploaded this earlier than usual to account for the UCL Final today
164?????
11:11 😂
123,853rd
AJ WAS SO REAL . I don’t know if 164IQ is good or bad 😭
AJ 😭😭😭😂
70 iQ is crazy
They had two actual geniuses on there wtf
Please bring mafia back  I wanna suggest a guess who is the real indian
This video suits Niko
not a single beta squad video that doesn't have me laughing hysterically
Kenny is looking sooooo goood omg!!!!
If lil Mabu was here he would get the pi
Getting a notification from Beta Squad always gets me excited ❤️
There is a match of magnanimous!
Niko man😂😂😂
i have already booked my ticket for the Soccer aid match 🎉 *i liked my own comment*
nikos humor 🔛🔝
11:10 the way sharks had to use an American accent 😂😂😂😂
We all know chunk should’ve been number one in the IQ placements
165?
many n words went through tattoos mind
abby made the correct order. except it was in reverse.
All of these comments are so boring, I know that these videos make your day but you don't have to say that every time
Smart to release before final
16:12 chunks cooked that poor man 😂😂
I thought number 3 was the smartest
great video
26+13-5  Sharky explain how that’s 34 😂😂 Your IQ is a little bit over the top
Nikos Humor is legendary and effortlessly a genius
1.niko 2.sharky 3.chunkz 4.Kenny 5.AJ
If Aj is ranking people smartest to dumbest he might have got it reversed there💀💀
AJ is such a troll 19:09
What an incredibly boring concept...
Niko will get knocked out one day, he's so disrespectful LMAO🤣
No change she has a IQ of 164
lets hope strangers never guess aj's IQ
No
I took the Amin Test too!!😂😂😂
Albert Einstein walalkiis 😂😂😂
Really great video!
another banger🎉🔥🎉
How come niko didn't smell a bad breath, I  imagine he forgot to mention
Can’t be the only one that saw AJ sniffing Chunkz’s pits 😂
Perfect order 👌👌
I feel like all beta squad have lower iqs than most of the lineup
I recon highest IQ would go niko,chunks,sharky,Kenny,AJ
19:51 Shoutout my boy stargate sg-1
So she has a higher iq than Einstein🧢  ?
niko 🔛🔝
52 seconds ago
BRUH WHO SAID I THOUGHT THE CAPITAL OF AUSTRALIA IS RIO
How did chunkz say yeah to Australiasia 😂😂😂
We all know Chunkz is the smartest out of the group
Need Jasmine's @
Nobody noticed pi was wrong?
What did chunks say???? They edited that slick
I was having a pretty bad day. Then I saw the Beta Squad uploaded…
At the end of the day Betasquad never knew that Amazon is gonna pull *AMZT66* and yet it happened, finally. Banger or bang?
"Round 2, We're all asking a question each, starting from me.. So Mr. Flannel shirt.  Describe yourself with 1 word" What a great question
Chunkz underpants showing caught me off guard 💀
Ranking strangers from smartest to dumbest? A video that's basically made for Niko's confidence
My balls are itchy
the white background is better
i love how they get embarrassed of eachother
For me Highest to Lowest IQ: Niko Chunks Sharky Aj Kenny
We all know niko is the smartest in there.
you guys should do a real iq test so we know who is the smartest beta squad member
I ain’t never been this early 😂
Can someone please explain what he means by 14:00? Why window?
Honestly made my day ❤
People saying erm is meant to be a sign of intelligence
what is Jasmine @???
Pretty sure Abby did smartest from chunkz to least smartest niko which is very accurate
rich
no yall sleep asf ABBY IQ IN THE 160s LIKE EINSTEIN
The Amount of Disrespect this old people are getting is triggering me!!! I like your Contents guys but you should discipline yourselves!!!! Unbelievable.
Probably the earliest I've ever been on a video and it's the best video to be early on
Beta squad are the funniest no one can replace them literally!!
Subscribe if your IQ IS ABOVE 69
I love the way they boost each others confidence
this kinda messed up no?
You know Chunkz was fuming at the end 😂😂
Bruh, 2 genius IQs there

Another Beta Squad screamer
albert ensteins IQ was 160. 164 is crazy
Damn chunkz looking slim sheesh his alr looking good, when he glows up he will be looking fineee
Chunks was bad vibes this vid
6 minutes ahahhaah

They need to go back into the white room studio, it has better vibes
Earlyyyyy❤❤❤
Niko's underwear at 20:37 goin crazy
abby got a first in whatever degree and just working as a phoneline sales assistant the uk is finished
Immediately my mind goes for the second guy (after the rearrangement), named Mark.  he looks like he was the head of CIA intelligence for 40 years or something!
0:29 wryaa
When Sharky did the accent 🤣🤣
bro cap
As much as I love the beta squad and their vids, it would be nice for them to branch out and try different types of vids
The models being not smart. Stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason 😂
how do they always think of new ways to make us laugh😂

Chunkz n his Somali lines r killing me!🤣🤣🤣

Can we all agree that Niko’s confidence is unmatched?
The American man got violated😂

Chunkz speaking somali was the best part
