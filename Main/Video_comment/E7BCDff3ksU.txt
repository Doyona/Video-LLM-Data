"Manage a football club? He can't manage a bloody sentence" 😂
Must bring him back for the points deduction.
Great job Rafa now we need U to go to manu lol 👍
You Knob, Rafa FAILED, However Agent Ancelotti succeeded.
Terrible impression. Absolute clown.
Sorry agent rafa. Your job was only half done. We on the other side of the park wanted relegation.
Don’t worry Frank lampard will save them 😅
It's the laugh that gets me 😂😂
Who's the sir?
There’s a toxic environment around Goodson at the moment, the squad, the decision making process regarding recruitment & the management decisions, are awful.  Coupled with the expectations of the fans, who think they should be running the club, haven’t helped.  It’s not just around Goodison, there are tribal & toxic connotations, around the our city.  We have just seen the manager sacked, possibly by fans opinions, who then throw stuff at the AFC players Everton fans should now hold their heads in shame, after what happened today.  We are surely better than this!
Tremendous stuff.
This guy is crap he would make a good road sweeper with his mouth
Lol
“Rafa sacked by Everton football clooob” 😂😂
If Everton fans thought Benitez was bad for the club, they should be looking at the owners who thought it would be good for the club.    The whole board is fucking deluded. It's hilarious.    I think Kenwright has finally used the last of the Arteta money on this latest manager pay off for Benitez.
Oh nooooo... this means no Agent Rafa anymore?
All this "agent" business that we get now from fans is so boring.
I like the Father Ted reference on the news banner at 1:25
😂😂😂😂
Can’t manage a sentence 😂
Agent Rafa hahaha
back on the dole now farley la.
Agent Rafa on the shampoo after collecting his massive payoff. Down the Tapas bar tonight. See you there at eight tonight Kloppy my  old mucker!  Bring  all the  lads. It's all on me.
Darren Farley’s agent Rafa fan Clooob.
The least funny human on the planet.
Love rafa ynwa!!
You can hear the Scouse accent coming out every now and then lol
ayo mengaji Al-qur'an dan hadist serta mengamalkannya,agar selamat dunia akhirat.
Do you think real Rafa looks up to agent Rafa?
The joke is this bloke has never been  funny .
Wayne Rooney’s so dumb that when the club told him he has to take a COVID test, he stayed up all night studying for it.
Six managers in six years. Christ, what an embarrassment.
Love it  😝
Congrats on winning 1 game Rafa
Lol the way he laughs is hilarious.
I reckon everything everton lose we get an agent rafa in his house with a cigar
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
21❤️AM I PRETTY 😍?
I am going to miss Agent Rafa. :( I hope he keeps coming back on this channel.
"The names Rafa, Agent Rafa. Everton football cloob...Mission accomplished!"
Makes you wonder who is more "brain dead".......the "cloob",or  Agent Rafa for taking the job on?
I'm an Everton fan but this is just too funny
Cruel ,but funny :)
he asked me to catch him a trout for tea once, sterling fella
what is L.B.C?
Somehow we need to keep agent Rafa
Love it !! Couldn't care less how much he was paid off that's Everton's stupid fault/problem .hilarious
Classy
"He cant manage a sentence"🤣🤣🤣
Former Vice-President of European Parliament: Boycott Beijing Winter Olympics Edward McMillan-Scott, former Vice-President of the European Parliament (2004 – 2014), said he had learned of the CCP’s suppression of Falun Gong back in 2006. When visiting Beijing, he met with several Falun Gong practitioners including one who had been detained for his faith. This practitioner testified that he had seen the body of a practitioner who had died in custody. The body showed evidence of organs having been removed.   McMillan-Scott said that the abovementioned example suggests that the hideous crime was occurring and that more and more evidence, including the volumes provided by Sir Geoffrey Nice QC from the China Tribunal, and Sabi, indicates that the CCP’s forced organ harvesting is on the scale of genocide and the killing of Falun Gong practitioners and Uyghurs for their organs have become crimes against humanity.   McMillan-Scott hopes that the international community will boycott the 2022 winter Olympic Games in Beijing, which would help raise awareness of the CCP’s suppression of minorities and groups such as Uyghurs, Tibetans, and Falun Gong practitioners.   Matas: We Cannot Lose the Platform of the United Nations David Matas, Canadian human rights lawyer, said that the United Nations (UN) has been slow in responding to China’s forced organ harvesting and calling for an independent investigation. Specifically, he said that response has been isolated, late, and insufficient.   A joint statement from experts on the United States Human Rights Council in June 2016 highlighted the CCP’s organ harvesting. It called on China to allow independent investigations by international human rights organizations.   Matas considers this development as progress by the United Nations, because it provides a platform for governments and experts who pay attention to human rights condition in China. More specifically, when prisoners of conscience are subjected to organ harvesting, this platform can be used by various governments and human rights experts to take action.
Agent Rafa got his eyes on Man Utd next.
Rafa top manager . Knows how to get a good pay out 😆
Who was "sir"?  Dalglish?
Big Dunc rules  Ok
Fucking inspired this like
https://youtu.be/J9w5nFaATPc
Can you now do the one where the fat Spanish waiter is seen serving tapas to drunk tourists in benidorm
Pretty obvious he went to destroy Everton....all red flag decisions from agent rafa
"Rondon signing for Craggy Island over 75s" simply....brilliant 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Agent Rafa it’s time to come in. Mission accomplished.
nice content! keep up the good work!
🤣🤣🤣 agent Rafa !
Sir Agent Rafa you have done well,all the best to you and family in the future,Everton are going where all small clubs belong,the Championship.
🤣🤣🤣
10 out of 10 mate. This has been hilarious!
Agent Rafa next mission man utd
Great work Agent Rafa! Surely the next James Bond?!!
Imagine being Rafa. Get a huge payday for messing with your rivals and taking them 16th 😂
The final one! haha
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Maybe agent Rafa will be back at Newcastle United Football Clooob…
Wayne Rooney " he can't even manage a sentence " the best one yet !! aye
Hahahahaha love it!!!
LMFAO
Damn this fella will have find another fat football figure to impersonate.
It was all JAMES RODRÍGUEZ fault
Another one of Darren,s/ Rooney quotes....sir red nose with Rooney---& Rooney tell,s him he wants to leave man u.....Alex says to Rooney "put it in writing"  so Rooney tells the camera "well that was the end of tha" ....lmfao at that one Darren ,keep up the good work 👍👍
8 million quid for abject failure. I’d have done it for a couple of grand and not screwed it up much worse than he did.
Agent Rafa should be sniffing around the Man U job in the summer
Talk sport even call him agent Rafa now
I'm sad that we won't hear from Agent Rafa again
As an Everton fan this is hilarious. The club is just a joke 😂
PLEASE PLEASE do not stop Agent RAFA. we love ❤️ him
Assume that is John Henry who Agent Rafa is talking to lol !    ext stage Eddie Howe sacked and Rafa back at The Fog on the Tyne ?
Liverpool fans very foolish they sing  Rafa Benetez after half time at Bredford so why do liverpool sack him
Evrrton Fotbol cLOOOOb
Well done Agent Rafa ! Enjoy a well deserved break before your next mission. 🥂
Hopefully a Steve Bruce on the Everton vacancy is incoming 🤣
Agent Benitez Codename:The Waiter!
Now that is funny, hahaha. Well done Rafa!
Everton problem is GK and defence ... Rafa has nothing to do with it. Buy an new GK and CB ...
ROONEY'S AT THE WHEEL!
That laugh.........
😂😂😂😂
Thought I was going to miss his ole at the wheel videos, but this benetiz Everton set has had me pissing myself desperate for the next instalment
Rooney can't even manage a sentence lol
the guys laughing all way to the bank.
He cannot manage a sentence...
He did a great job
This lad will do anything for attention.. pub quality
I was genuinely gutted when I heard Rafa was getting axed. Love this character 😀
He's not even hiding his love for Liverpool anymore.
Sooo true….
Hahaha.....Come in Agent Rafa your work is done...next stop the Emptyad!!!!
Brilliant 🤩
Great news for craggy island over 75's 5 a side 🤣🤣
There goes our chance to sell Longstaff 🤦‍♂️
Omfg!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Rafa a liverpool legend fr
About mid way he broke out of Rafa and just started doing himself XD
The brutal truth is that Everton are a shit team, useless and clueless players. You just have to see what Carlo Ancelotti is doing for Real Madrid, and yet could not improve the team at Goodison Park. It certainly has nothing to do with the manager, their last two have won many League, Champions League and Europa League titles in the past. It’s like the legendary Bill Shankly said, “if Everton were playing in my back yard, I would close the curtains”!
Rafa'll be up early today. Not looking for work but he's got to walk the dogs, take the girls to school, back to make Montse's breakfast and then count his payoff.
Next Mission - Manchester United …… 😎😁😁😁
Agent Rafa will be back in Tottenham Manager coming in 2022
I can’t- this is too funny tho- 😂😂😂😂😭
Rafa is me playing Championship Manager 98 as Liverpool, also becoming manager of Man United and free transferring all their players.
Manage a Club he can't manage a sentence  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
whyyyyyyy?????? Everton must pay us football fans for dear life!!!!! Bring OLE in #YNWA
Please do raffa and rooney scetches if rooney comes
I'll miss this series.
Agent Rafa slips into scouse a fair bit!
Mission accomplished 8 million pay off I'm minted 😂😂😂😂 please keep agent Rafa
Does this mean no more agent Rafa,hope not.😂
As much as this hurts. It’s the only joy I get being a Toffee. Fair play
I knew this was coming....🤣🤣🤣
This is in such bad taste. Farley has gotten old now... he is no longer funny. Conor Moore is the man...
So Long, Farewell, Auf Wedersehen, Piss off,...,.
Brilliant just Brilliant agent Rafa the best since 007
Back to the toon agent Rafa! We need you!
He can`t manage bloody sentence...haaaaa 🤣🤣🤣
' Rooney - he can't manage a sentence' 🤣 🤣
He cant even manage a bloody sentence
Won Big dunc players full time
bye bye Rafa
Can imagine the players pissing themselves at this 🤣🤣🤣
This is absolutely spot on,no joke this is for real,we must be the stupidest/ worst run football club in the league, God help the poor sod who has to manage this bunch of useless gobshites,hang your heads in shame you guys at the top,fucking clueless and you guys actually get paid for NOT knowing how to run  a football club.
I think im the only one focusing on news subtitles
he did Everton like Mick Malthouse did Carlton
Next job for Rafa, ManUnited!!!
Please .Not Rooney.Top player that's itm
Your funniest charachter ever
I believe there’s a job opening at Manchester united
Hahaha I gone to miss Agent Rafa. Hope he gets the soon to-be vacancy at Newcastle 😂
Craggy Island over 75s!! 😂 😂  Should provide good competition with Father Romeo Sensini for the top scorer.
Little ev haaaaaaaa
0:20 Loool the nanosecond _'fact'_ just felled me.
Next stop Man United
Agent rafa is so sad he couldn't get the job done he really wanted to get Everton into the championship
# Ole is on the shortlist 👅
Agent Rooney takes over!
If they loose soo much money sackin managers then why offer soo much in first place . Atleast some of that could be used to donate to lower league clubs who could do serious ground improvements with 8 million . No womder Prem teams get no where , swapping managers X1 or 2 a season . Then another seasom wasted on the boss gettin his owm players in . Insamity
# KGB on line 007  🐻
Gonna miss Agent Rafa! That "sir" guy he is talking to should be revealed at some point. Good times Agent Rafa!
🤣🤣🤣
Marriage made in hell we all knew this
The funniest videos you ever done
When are clubs going to stop hiring that pillock.
He devastated🤣🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣 with his 8 million quid pay off. Everton fans say farewell to Agent Rafa
Brilliant 😂
Not very good this one
I'm struggling to choose which word is more iconic: FACT or CLOOB! And who on earth was the "sir" he kept calling? Super skits!!!!!!
Big Dunc taking over again 😂😂😂😂😂 he’s the problem and they can’t see it 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can't wait for agent Martinez
He sounds kind of Dutch in this. Reminds me of Goldfinger from Austin Powers.
😆🤣🤣
Need appoint Rooney - a Childhood Everton fan and Player . Done well at Derby and is winner . Appoint Rooney look what Gerard doing a Villa and attracting top players .
thank god we dont have to sit through these rinse and repeat rafa skits anymore...stopped being funny agter the second time he did it.
It’s so sad Agent Rafa series came to an end.
Good job Rafa you did your job which was to destroy Everton football cloob which was achieved.   Look forward to agent Rooney.
You plastics don't half talk some shite. Not bothered about Everton either I believe.
Laughable sacked all the way to the bank
This fella isn’t funny , boring as
Will be brilliant when your seen on the street and your teeth end up coming out you hoop.
😂🤣😂 legend!
I noticed a glint of happyness in Rafa's eyes in Saturdays post match, as if he was already spending the £8mk.    Get in there Rafa lad!!!!!!
Did he get 8m ??? The world is flat.
Everton are soo lucky Burnley, Newcastle, Norwich are soo bad  To be real tho Rooney would do amazing at Everton
I have been looking frwd to this all morning heard the announcement during a game this morning all the best in the future to agent Rafa , Darren keep it going please this can’t be the last of agent rafa
Would love to see steven gerard's opinion on Rafa aswell.
Very funny but the laughs weren't as good as on previous videos.
Wayne Rooney 🤣🤣🤣
You can keep making these videos every week if Everton lose with agent Rafa at home laughing that he caused their destruction
😂😂😂
Genius! I send these to my Everton supporting brother! How we laugh! 😂😂
One of your best mate. We love you. Hopefully we get errrrrmmmm errrmmm Rooney from County Derby next
Agent Duckenfield 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
He should do one about Hillsboro. That would be hysterical 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Big Dunk is the Man
All fun and games until you realise this is the last Agent Rafa video we get :( Was fun while it lasted. One of his best characters of all time. Will miss that laugh too.
Wayne Rooney would sort our club 100% But I dont want to dis Derby. Big Dunc and all at EFC needed to end of season now. Get players back!
Agent Rafa 😃
They gonna need Big Sam to rescue them !!
Mission Accomplished.  FACT.  😂🤣😂🤣
Despite being a Blue, I have enjoyed your agent Rafa series. Fact. Thank you, Sir.
Football clood
I offered him 8 million he bit my hand killed me , Darren Farley goat
🤣🤣🤣
God I'll miss agent rafa One of the funniest characters
gonna miss him Agent Rafa that is
Priceless…best character ever.  Can he be Secret Agent Rafa and scupper other clooobs now too?
brutal :)
So so funny. Brilliant work Darren. Keep them all coming. Boom on
The only downside to the great work that agent Rafa completed at Everton is that it was over far too quickly…I’m gonna miss him 🤣
Agent Rafa is eternal. This character but continue to appear.
As soon as I read the news I kept refreshing on this channel 😂😂😂
Love to se3 Rafa and Steve at Newcastle.
Agent Rafa is too good to die 😮
Best laugh of the week,well come back soon to Newcastle.
Lol 😆 🤣 😂
As an Everton fan I’m over the moon he’s gone, also it spells the end of this 😂😂
who is this shithouse
While as a PL fan I am sympathetic to the situation of both the club and manager and believe this decision of relieving him is the correct one but I will definitely miss agent Rafa if this is the last of it hope not 🤞.
probably one of your best impressions, going to miss agent rafa :(
This video alone shows what a laughing stock Everton are right now, the joke about Rooney is so true he's only been in management for five minutes overseeing a club that will probably go down to league one and pundits are actually suggesting he should be the next manager - bonkers
Brilliant
I will miss the "cloooob".
He's proper not funny
Agent Rafa cracked me up, thanks for the laughs.
Darren I now need to know who ....'Sir' is..😂😂😂😂'
I’m gonna miss agent Rafa so much . That laugh is the best
Please get Brendan Rodgers Everton,we need agent Brendan 😂😂😂
BREAKING NEWS:                                    Agent Rafa 2 Man Utd CONFIRMED!!
Massive Everton fan.....but fucking hilarious
Manage a football club? He can't even manage a sentence 🤣🤣
Agent Rafa needs a spin off series. Fact!
Agent rafa, is the best 😂😂😂😂
I didn’t know Rafa was Welsh
Super funny
he sold their best player to stevie g 😍😍😍
I always hoped when Rafa got sacked we’d find out who the “sir” was!!
"manage everton football club, he can't even manage a bloody sentence!" is such a good line.
Going to miss this soooo much!
Going to miss agent Rafa 😭😂
8million to fail in your job for 6 months....what a ridiculously overpaid industry football is.
The young players like rondon 😀😀 everton football kloooooooooooob I will miss agent rafa he is funny 😂
Enough of these videos absolute cringe glad to see the back of Benitez
Thank fuck for that. The Agent Rafa content has been the same boring shit every time and hasn't been funny once. Now maybe you can get back to being entertaining.
"He's only 97".
Rafa the undercover agent for Liverpool lol
I hope he gets the Manchester United job.
It's sad to lose yet another memorable character after Ole at the Wheel or 'Well you know' Bruce. But fresh meat surely incoming...
0:22😂
Love Agent Rafa! Great storyline. Hope we can find a way for him to come back in.
Agent Rafa to Man u, in 6 months
The Shittest kopite “comedian” go and join up with the rest of the boys at paddy power
And the best thing is they are gonna appoint Rooney, crash helmet on standby Darren 🤣😂🤣
who is next for the chopping block...At least Rooney got Championship experience and relegation battle experience...  Was looking rosie for Rafa at the start of the season just downhill after the key injuries.
We need an Agent Rafa season 2!!!!!!
Agent rafa a liverpool legend frfr😂😂😂😂
He can’t manage a bloody sentence 😂 that was deep
I'm going to miss agent Rafa
Agent Rafa: MISSION ACOMPLISHED! 🇪🇸
He can't manage a sentence 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who is the sir.....Klopp?
Football clooob
Absolutely quality 👌 👏 👍

Classic series of unfortunate events 🎉
So true
We'll see
I rate this bloke’s impressions of other scousers.
Where next for Agent Rafa United? City?
He's done Chelsea He's done Everton   If this man ends up at United it will be the perfect trilogy 🤣
😂😂😂
Agent rafa will be reporting for duty at man utd football club next season.FACT.
Liverpool supporters are absolutely delighted with the job agent Rafa has done  YNWA 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Steve Bruce to Everton, 'well you  know'😄. Make it so!
Benitez literally did a fantastic job in the eyes of us reds. One of my favourite managers.
We're still Dignified. LFC Scum. Classless.
Got this one wrong: should’ve been agent rafa getting scolded for getting sacked before relegating Everton
Haha.
It was Chelsea's fault
When we needed him most, Agent Rafa didn't disappoint
Mission accomplished! haha!
we need agent Rafa at Newcasle
Newcastle next manager ready and waiting then, unless Howe gets a few wins in the next couple of months or so.
Mission accomplished
😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Does this mean there will be no more agent Rafa videos?
Reinstate yourself as manager,can't wait 👍💯💥
I was waiting for this grand finale.
RIP agent Rafa 😂😩
Rondon joins craggy island over 75s on loan 😆😆😆😆😆
Rafa The Gaffa! The evertonians didnt deserve him
This character cannot die lol
8 million for 6 months work. Not bad and will probably work into another job whenever hes ready. Lol 😂
Come in agent Rafa
Tacky
Glad that this particular skit is over--not one of the better ones.
You don't get sacked anymore, you get paid off.
Remember when he was funny? Me neither
I think these videos killed Rafa Earlier
Yes yes!!!!! Thanks Darren asked for This in another Vid 👍🏻👍🏻
I'm a toffee but we'll have the last laugh now he's gone
Rafael loadsamoney Benitez laughing all the way to the bank. When Everton were willing to sign him as manager, can Man Utd now do the same to send them further down the table. :)
This played out exactly as expected, just like when Harry Redknapp went to Southampton from Pompey. Thinking about it, you should do a throwback series as agent Harry going to Southampton and getting them relegated 👍👍👍
Imagine the scenes if Bruce went to Everton. I'd love it
Hope Darren does a sacked football managers rehab would be so funny
This is simply pure quality....
The best thing about rafa's spell as everton manager was these videos an am an everton fan lmao.
😂😂😂 amazing 😂😂😂
Fact
Please do one on Moyes whinging bout the Leeds result. Least u can't do bielsa 😂😂
Come in agent Rafa your mission is complete..come in we have a new assignment
"We've ruined them. sir!" 🤣🤣🤣
Agent Rafa's work is complete.
Mission accomplished.....
"He can't even manage a sentence" pissed myself laughing!
Should have mentioned the new left backs back pass to a Norwich player!
He used to be really good at the Rafa impressions 😂😂 Gone downhill just like Everton lately
😁😁😁😁👍❤
Hahahaha
Long live Agent Rafa
Classic
Funny. But there's an inherent logical flaw in all of this: why would Liverpool want to destroy Everton?They haven't been a threat to anyone for a very long time.
These are the worst impressions ever
You absolutely crack me up Darren. I am crying with laughter 🤣🤣
😂😂
Lol 😂 fantastic work Agent Rafa 🙏🤣🍺💯☝️
What's agent Rafa's next mission? Can he do Utd next season?
I am gonna miss agent rafa :)
Salomon Rondon joins craggy island over 75s 5 a side on loan🤣 gonna miss you agent rafa
I've been waiting all day for this, FACT. Cheers Darren.
Agent Rafa your next mission is to take over at Man United
As a Red, I approve of this message. Rafa's legendary status across Stanley Park well 'n' truly enhanced! 🤣😂
The end of a magnificent era.
0:23😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We all knew this was coming
The bald cap UNDER the hat is commitment
It's funny and at the same time sad because it's all too true. Benitez leaves Everton a lot weaker than when he arrived. Moshiri should not have the sole say in the next manager appointment. He doesn't understand enough about football or human nature.
We all knew Agent Rafa would be here for a short time !!
Salute agent Rafa, you are legendary
I don't know what I will do without agent Rafa, I'm in stitches every time I watch him
Funnier would be Ferguson leading them to relegation
Looking forward to the Wayne Rooney ones if he gets the job 😂
This is hilarious 😂 😂 love this impression…   Wayne Rooney can’t manage a sentence omg I’m dead 😵 😂
It's the laugh for me! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Rafa Benitez must be "chumpin" at the bit hoping to get back at Everton someday!!
Farleys got under Rafas skin, he didn't have a chance.😄😄😄
I knew it had to come, but it's still a sad day. No more Agent Rafa videos.
Rafa can laugh all the way to the bank with his payout and leaving Everton in the shit.
Rondon joins craggy islands over 75s  on loan🤣🤣
I’m going to miss these Agent Rafa videos so much now he’s been sacked 🥲
Sacked by Everton football cloob !!!! 8M will buy plenty Paella (farts) loool
The Conclusion of Agent Rafa
Brilliant
🤣🤣🤣.... Rooney next .. erm.... erm... erm...
IF only Rafa had held out for a while until Newcastle got bought over, he would have been back in Toon! Although I don't know if he would want to be a manager in the Championship next year by the way it's looking!
Benitez career is ruined his arrogance cost him
Superb 🥳😂
🤣😂
Cloob.
.........even funnier than steve bruce.....................cheers!
As much as this an amazing contract fid Rafa.  It ranks number two in my knowledge inthe sports world.  I remember the Totonto Raptors re-signing coach Butch Carter to a five-year five million dollar contract.  With in a half-season he started saying a lot of insane things that got him fired.  He never coached again as far I know but I hear him on the radio regularly and the man is perfectly sane.  Best retirement plan ever.
We couldn't wait.... The journey was magical whilst it lasted, simply sublime, comedy gold.
Should of re-flooded the new stadium.
Amazing...
This guy spends all his time talking rubbish......
We need a new assignment for agent Rafa
😎
What a shame this pathetic sketch has come to an end
Can we have Agent Rafa calling other players and managers?! 🤣
Agent Rafa love You
It's a real shame Darren will have to retire Agent Rafa in the same way he had to stop wearing an American Football helmet for Wayne Rooney.
WELL DONE RAFA THANKS YOU PUT THEM lN THE DUSBIN.
EVERTON CHAMPIONSHIP IS COMING FOR YOU
EVERTON REST IN PEACE
I imagined Rafa was tucking into a nice big Sunday Roast today. Mission accomplished, good job agent 2005!
Lit. art imitating life!
Can't wait for agent Rooney at Liverpool but I think I might be waiting a while.
It certainly was a ridiculous appointment  typical modern day stupidity
Brill😂
The evertonians are fuming over you on twitter
Agent Rafa must continue with weekly vids, we as fans of lfc demand this 👏 👍 😀
You have to do a Rooney video next 😂
Yes 🙌 this has made my weekend again Iam laughing so hard I’ve literally wet myself 😆😆🤣🤣🤣🤣🥳🥳🥳
Can we still have these videos even though he has been sacked??
Agent Rafa ... Mission Accomplished! 😂🤣😂. Good One! If you can't cry about you gotta Laugh
Good video, very funny😃🤣
Highlight of my day!
Best football agent ever 🤣🤣🤣
I've been waiting all day on this to from when rafa got sacked 🥴🥴🥴🥴
Evertons new manager. Is Steve Bruce
I'll miss these videos. Agent Rafa is my favourite character.
Only sad thing is that Agent Rafa is gone now.
I was devastated when I saw him sacked gonna miss these

Disrespect for James Rodriguez in England is unbelievable
"He can't manage a sentence". 🤣
rooney managing will provide just as good content 😄😁

I have a weird feeling we'll see Rafa in a Newcastle dugout by March
Now we wait for Rooney.

It was funny and I think rafa done this on purpose but one thing I will say is I think Rooney will do amazing with the club

Rooney is a sentimental appointment only.

Mission accomplished 😂😂😂😆😆
