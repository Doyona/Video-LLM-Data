LETS GOOOOOO ALEX !!!!!!!
They are disgusting to give out
out
Ricer choi
That lamb is fast
Need a black Lamborghini vs Toyota Supra
I love how we some how turned the lambo into the underdog 😂
Fast Lambo
La embarro con ese ferrari hay pegado
Looks like stevie wonder painted the lambo🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
More cutaways..😂
Alex's Lambo is AWD or RWD he can choose since his car has Motec
That first race definitely didn’t look like it was 2 cars to me
1st race wasn't even 2 cars,it was closer than that,like half a car
See this show began with the drones and and the speed at end of races how could this have happened it been forgotten
mopar fans are heated rn
You already know when they pull up with that heavy accent that their whips gonna hit like Tyson in his prime
Trash
You must be so uneducated to break the law
I bet Choi or his dad gave Trump a huge donation.  Selective Lawfare.
Please invest in some drag lights, ya wankers.
you guys should invite firepunk diesels!
2 cars: -  -       2 cars: -                         -     Please fire that guy he has one job and cant do it.
jeep didnt jump run slow mo he went when the elbows moved that a racer!
ong the jeep didn’t jump. Old heads just getting too old
Jeep did NOT jump.
They all lost at the betting 😂😂
Now imagine if the lambos awd worked shit would’ve been brutal
Knew my boy Alex would win hy
Needs to do episodes with less talking and more racing 😂😂
That's one sick lambo
That jeep is so good
Jeeps (all of them) are the #1 "I have serious issues" vehicle in earth. I don't think even Lambo comes close to this. Maybe BMW.
Project torque team  Texas on the map
That’s a damn fast Jeep
Those damn SRT Jeeps are 5k lbs. Throw that setup in a 90s Wrangler
Lambos always win Texas 2k or gtrs
"I done watched plenty of shows!  This is the part where the villain comes back on"  LoL!
I turned a 14 minute video into a 45second video.  SOOOOOO much irrelevant bullshit
The Jeep guy has the double cup lol
Jeep jump start
they scammed my boy jrfab!!!!!
What a raceeee😍😍😍
After that vote 1000% needed that lambo 2 win❤️
I’m from Nor Cal but when I hear or see a Texas plate I’m like “va valió madre!” Lmao jeep ftw
Probably the best race I've seen in this v that
He never jumped on the first race
Racing starts at 9:27.  You're welcome.
Lamborghini has the reaction time of a moderately caffeinated tortoise.
that jeep is fast!
A guy who owns a jeep would be the one to jump the start........
v8 superiority my ass lmao
That second race was a dumb ass idea lol, i wanted straight up so bad
who tf is alex choi
BEEF FRIED RICE  GUY CHEATING
Around here, you take the emblem off the vehicle you beat in a race on showcase on your grill.
Hert>Gary
he racist "then these guys throw turbos" what he mean these guys
That lambo is fast
Why give him the hit ffs u guys are a joke
We miss you HERD. Come back soon yo!! 😢
NOS is actually disgusting. Nice job almost pretending to drink some. gag
I’m concerned on their length judging skills 😂they say two car but the first race was by a half car and the second like 3 or maybe 4 cars MAYBE
He didnt jump and just get a fucking tree
That’s the problem with kids like that lambo driver. Got heaps of money for these high end cars, but he can’t even drive in a straight line and shift properly. I mean, that’s the basics of driving.
Don’t bet against TT Lamborghinis
I used to have a 2006 jeep commander that was a V8 with a flowmaster exhaust. Shit was loud asf, would love to see one with a turbo in it. Wonder how it’d perform
That kid is annoying af🤮
It was definatepy a 5 car lead the 2nd race 😂
MY names JEEF
His claim to fame was he builds and destroys super cars? Lol so cringe
That Jeep was impressive weighing that much
We need this Jeep Back
Alex Choi reminds me of a douchy version of red mist from kick ass
Lambo is faster , props to that jeep, but if they start the same from the line ,lambo wins every time.
This little kid don't even know how to drive a  automatic car...
Wow the lambo driver is under drugs ? DCT mismanaging or what ?
For rwd that Lambo hooked big time!
Good video
That Jeep is a monster
Almost every video with a V8 I've seen they lie about there HP
That Huracan sounds so beautiful❤
Damnnn the really wanted the jeep to win lol
Sheepy Race? More like Sleepy Race.  Alex sleeping at the tree.
Rip ken #kb43ver
6.1s are so slept on lmao
Jr killed it
Imagine the lambo with AWD
Yeh seriously 2 cars?? Dude is blind lol
Race starts at 9:30
9:28 Yay 😁🇵🇷😁🇵🇷😁
Bro they need to do better standoffs cause you can guess instantly who’s going’s to win easily you have a car that has more hp and less weight that car will always win real life if they don’t win it’s because of the driver that’s all they really need to step up there game come on hoonigan they need to do better line ups period
If the hurrican doesn't dust the jeep the owner can't drive.
Haven’t seen Gary go super saiyan in a while. Com on let’s see final form
He beat a suv lol
Who ever is describing how much the win was by shouldn’t do it again
Round 2 was meant to say Alex by 2 buses
2nd race was about 5 cars gap for Alex and they said 2 cars. 😂 They clearly hate Alex. Good thing Alex brought up the question "What's your description of 2 cars?" 😂
If money was no object... I'd take the Jeep. I have an unnatural, unhealthy love for large, heavy sleepers that move way faster than they ought to 😅  I've always found "Refrigerator" NFL plays to be infinitely more impressive than any QB/RB/WR play.
🗿
I’m 1 min in, this keep is smoked
HOW YALL GONNA DOUBT ON THE CHOIMOBILE BEFORE THE RACE I HAD IT AS SOON AS I SAW THE VIDEO THAT SLOW ASS JEEP AINT DOING NOTHING 😂😂😂🤣🤣
Get another episode with FREDDYLSX
This is the worst officiating of any episode I have seen. The Jeep won by a half car the first race with the hit. The second race the lambo won it by like 5 cars. Come on guys.
Round 2 is dishonest, they didn’t give the go-ahead at all, but the lambo started
It astonishes me how all of these people can't drag race without jumping. It's infuriating.
Round 2, Jeep lifted at the end.  Easy to see.  Why can people be honest in racing !!
Who’s choosing the highlights in mods is 1000hp nothing anymore ? 🤣
So... rich spoiled punks blowing money destroying whatever.  Never worked a hard day.
Aero on a jeep haha
I wish I could watch Ken block drive one more time
Jeep by two wasn't the Lambo just behind the jeep?
Alex Choi vs the 2000hp gtr
As sound as I heard Rafael talk it was a *WRAP*
I’d be so upset to get clowned by a grand Cherokee in a lambo
2 cars... 2 buses maybe XD
Well I guess there would be no reason to race a UGR Lamborghini considering a 1200 horsepower twin turbo Lamborghini just won.  Shame because I think the community has been asking for a proper twin turbo Lamborghini to race up a lot of these vehicles including the mustang.
Nothing beat a v10 Dohc TT Top End.  beast Mode
Nice to see eminem into cars now
ALEX CHOI FOR THE WIN
2nd race was by 2 cars.... LOL  2 buses maybe.
jeep did not jump at all, at a track that would be low .100 reaction time
playback at 11.24 at 0.25   looked more like 6 cars tbh
"tell us dear(lambo), where did that goon touched you?!"  lambo: "uhhg... that durty koreanese touched me in all the No-No spots... sniff"   "Faking Choi, ... , suparcar fondler!"   q=D hope yall can laugh a lill...
Probably only rave that pole smoker would take cause he knows he's gonna win
Didn't watch yet. Areo dynamics, power to weight and power favor the Lambo. Lambo wins.
The Lambo was in AWD, not RWD, you can see the front tires slip a little on the 2nd race launch.
Dude..just stop and put the freakin hood on your car!  Should be a rule..no hood...no race!
I don’t think the Jeep jumped on the first race that was a clean race
With a build 1800hp lambo and your worries are about OEM body parts" oh man" 🤣
Did he pee his past on the last race
Coolest and funniest car People on The net.. Hoonigan creew 🦸‍♂️😂😂😂.. They make these races complete!!
I wanna see this lambo against OnDGas
That’s a nice yeep.
Ayo yhat clip of the kids calling and its herts "you wanna go!?"
12 year olds driving lamboos.........
Lambo just needed a warm up 🫠
should do a slow car vs slow car race. That would be fun and funny to watch. haha
Jeep jumped yall jeep/v8 fanboys need to stop this bs
Purple turned it up some lol
Hand dropping sucks.
My dad has a 6.1 jeep srt8 and it's bonkers fast and beautiful
Super Trofeo Evo? fuck off liar Ali Express
Wait y’all missed up in the intro already in the title the lambo said RWD an He Said We Have Both AWD 🥴
This is my car got the v6 rn trying to buy a 5.7
Exotic cars are geared for long distance
Cheteers 🤣
A chase is a race was coined by people with slow cars that need to cheat.
Who calls the car lengths at the end of the track cause that first race was won by a car lol. Sometime you guys call of car lengths people won by and it’s not even close lol
these live every car guys drem 😢
all these wild supercars and their so slow off the line
What transmission did he say he had in the jeep
@4:04 hahahahah
This vs that hoonigan staff edition cars!!!
NO way the Huracan was RWD.
he did not jump one round on. CAPPPPPPPPPPPPP you got Treeddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
How do y’all do this for a living and make the wrong prediction every video? It’s baffling. Is there a joke I’m missing or something?
Thats not a SRT8 anymore that's Jeep Trackhawk Senior.
Ngl most people want pictures of other peoples lams ME THO ID BE THE ONE CHARGING MY PHONE 😂😂😂😂😂 ida been like LOOK DAWG IT WAS AT 2 PERCENT THAT LAMBO SPEED CHARGES IT REAL NICE
def not by 2 cars
Dude was lying about the lambo not having awd. It was working during the race lol
if he lost, lambo would be calling to get their car back lol.
Hemi. Stock, or boosted..still the best bang for the buck. We all love Lambos..but the up front coin & insurance will bury anyone making less than the Kardashians.. or Zelenskyy & his $70 bil of US taxpayer money, aha.
Bless Sheepy Race 🐑🏁🙏🏼
Con tanto programa y no tienes un 🤮semáforo 🤦🤢
slow mo it seems on point to me by microseconds if anything!
Nice one🎉
It seems like that every male american is wearing a hoodie this year on internet.
late to the party on this one.. that's customcaddys (YT) old jeep.
I love that HURACAN that Alex has built with Sheepyrace 🐑. ❤️🔥🔥💥💥💥
dude in the jeep fixed his hair for 20 minutes and nothing changed
Sticker plus power.
Bruh bruhs paint job cost more than my entire DSM 😂  big ass Garrett T76, fuel management, stand alone everything still worth less than my guys front bumper 😂
They suck keep jumping 🤦🏻‍♂️... That Chrysler lying way more than 1000 hp
Only one thing totally sucks about your videos is you never give us the times that it takes them to get to the end of the track.
After 1st race Alex Choi said, "Sheepey Race! Lend me your energy!"
Dude with the white front hat keeps putting his filthy paws on peoples’ cars..  Keep your hands off, man..
❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🏁❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🛣
Where did that young punk get a modified Lambo?  Ridiculous
'We got a race!' Every Race 🤣
I think the Lamborghini has AWD working...
I've always thought a chase is a race is a cowards way to win. I'm glad the Lamborghini won
11:56 is facts) wtf are these calls
We’re tf did you guys see 2 cars the 1round?! he got Alex by a half car and the jeep jump 😂👨🏽‍🦯
that last one was the clean one and even though the jeep got him off the line, alex reeled him in....NEVER SAY DIE!!!!
Yeah, sorry, jeep jumped the gun......that should be a dq but they say "a chase is a race"....
EsO VALE J.R 🇲🇽
13:21 name that song like PLEASE
on the first race he didnt jump it was a perfect launch.
Whoever edited in one punch man deserves a raise
#mopthefloor After you finish watching, go ahead and dial it back to 8:00 for some comedic relief after the Alex Choi redemption. Not a single believer! Broken AWD and still showed out. Bravo, Alex.
Lambo is lambo man ❤️
No way the lambos 4wd wasn't working
Mannnn couple my friends got on the show and raced how can I? Haha
When they say 2 cars do they mean Hot Wheels?
2nd race was by 2 buses 💀
Second run is Alex Choi
Sandbagged that first round
출발신호가 존나구려.
THAT DUDE DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO FLAG THE RACES U NEED A LIGHT I SEE ALOT OF YOUR VIDS AND THE WAY YOU RAISE YOUR HANDS PEOPLE JUMP ON THE HAMD DROP.
Did he ask if the jeep was 5.7 hemi when it’s an srt8 that come with a factory 6.1 😂 they should educate before recording the video
Those extra highend gears helped a ton at the end there.
0:14 0:17 song name
SRT8
Both of the first two races were by 2 cars. 😂. First race was 2 smart cars. The second was two limo’s
Alex turned it up or the GC turned it down or Choi was slummin first round lol
And how much lighter is the Lamborghini compared to the jeep,I'd rather own that jeep any day compared to a Lamborghini
Lambo probably turned it up. No way to prove it though.
Bruh that lambo nearly burst my AirPods and it’s at half volume like WTF and after this video I actually stated to like lambo more and now I’m interested in them
The fact that the jeep still kept up pretty good is cool
Love the videos but you guys need a damn light or something! Someone is always jumping with arm drops!
im not going to lie. that's one ugly lambo
the first race was definitely not a jump, my dude just has insane reaction time
I wouldn't say he jumped the first round though, looked like one of them incredible launches people get. And for the jeep to have less power and more weight to ALSO keep up with that Lambo like that, that's amazing! Though, that top end is crazy on that jeep when he gets close to the 1,000ft. Just give him a a slightly bit longer, and we will see the jeep pulling right back around on him. Amazing race nonetheless!
Lambo winner winner!
That jeep didn't beat him by 2 cars and Alex beat him by way more than 2 cars lmao 😭😭😂😂
I can’t believe everyone underestimated chois lambo
Im so confused on why these guys are wearing hoodies. Was this record during winter? Does winter exist in Cali?
Makes me so happy that nobody voted for Alex
Definitely one of the best this vs that races
Damn that jeep driver has that 0.00ms reaction speed on that first hand drop.
alex’s huracan vs betos crawfish would be crazy
Jeep 😂🤣
whoever gives the results tripping. Bro said 2 cars lmaoooo
A chase is a race. Texas rules 💪🏼
I think i understand keeping it street racing but damn a red orange green light would shave off so many problems.
gotta love those srt8 jeeps   super under rated because of the trackhawk.
I wouldn’t call that a jump. I mean blocks daughter took off the same way in the old episode. At first hand movement
Jumped and still got smoked lmfao
It’s the trivesticals
the way they just dropped the cover on the roof of that lambo. O.o
We are the carriers  of  presence of God, , and will carry the presence of God.   Out of mouth com truth and Justice praise and worship  Love and Kindness
He didn't jump first race, it was perfect with the drop of the hand.
How much money does Alex make to do this to these cars?
Someone lying abt their power numbers
Wtf🤯
Jeep didn't jump, Alex is just asleep behind the wheel lmaoo. Even on the last race his reaction was slower. He just has a faster car. No hate to Alex. That's a mean Lambo
As I predicted 🙏
After watching this video again thr Lamborghini did have and working he lied
Not bad for a soccer mom car
Lmao I don't even need to watch this and ik the little jeep is gonna lose😂😂 1,200hp light lambo vs 1,000 boat not even a comparison.
Im so sick of Alex Chode
choi the biggest dueche in all of the land
This has to be the ugliest lambo I have ever seen
well im sorry but that jeep is infinitly more cool xD.    for a lambo that thing is slow ass F
How was that two cars at the rear bumper
Imagine no only having the passion for Lambo but also the fabrication experience modifying the Lambo so much being placed against ....a truck. I'd be a little annoyed.
If you go frame by frame (pause the video and use the comma and period keys) you can see that the jeep was spinning tires before the arms were even half way down. But, I say no jump just because if there was a tree, he didn't move enough for it to be called a jump.
Alex just faster
Lol, alex took the first race imo. He wouldve won if the jeep didnt jump
If tht wasn’t a brick 🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡🫡
13:07 😭
the one punch man clip lmao
9:30 1st race
This is Alex we're talking about. He won before the race started
that jeep needs a 426 and a better than oem intake mani then the super car is gone back ., just saying as a mopar racing guy beside as street say its heavy and has less power less engine les ero but the gap was like that ? damn the jeep is happy
Man this kid needs to learn how to launch. He got treed hard. He's lucky that Lambo made up for it.
Why don’t you guys do a flashlight start? Seems like every match up there’s at least one race where somebody jumps. Obviously do to the fact that none of the drivers do much street racing, let alone a cash days
Jeep sandbag the 2nd run. 3rd run choked on the top end n lost. Lol
for the first race, if you go frame by frame using the period button on a keyboard you can see it was a perfect launch
Hurt saying "wanna go" to the kids calling had me weak 🤣
What's Alex chois story? He come from money like schmee? Or hit it big on social media?
Imagine all that for being not that fast. Id rather see a hoonigan foot race if you ain't running faster than a Tesla.
The editor is the true winner here
Eh I don’t care much for Alex , his daddy bought him all his stuff he don’t know shit cars and  about a hard days work.. trust fund baby
Give him the hit stfu
I now own and trademarked what Gary king said “sus ass sh*t”
The accidental sack punch is one of the funniest anime moments in history and for you’ll to insert it at complete random like that was pure genius 🫠
1st race was like a 1.5 cars race two like 5 cars. i think ya'll be losing some cred.
Chois lambo is the best lambo around. Absolute animal
Lamborghini awd seems to be working just fine.
Such a great race. Looks like the awd was working fine, lol.
Lambo definitely ate.
My man in the jeep did not jump timed that shit right👌
the mercedes 5g tronic is indestrutible! my first car, a w210 e320cdi wagon with a 3.2l inline 6 turbo diesel engine had that transmission. even the 65 amg cars with the twin turbo v12 engine had this transmission, even the slr mclaren had this one! it can take abuse, if you mod it even shifts fairly fast.
I have a 2007 Grand keerokee crd, but It has only 250hp🥲
Vinwiki guys panicked at chois car.
That was a hell of a race!
That Jeep is the ultimate sleeper
Alex 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Weak race I don’t like he won so let’s do this smh unsubscribed activated
A run back is a sign of a real man
lamborghini hit that more bhp button
The 3 vesticles..... 😆🤣😂 EDIT: I´m glad Micah pointed out the Ferrari batch, that just left me confused in the intro immediately. 🤷‍♂
They say jump but no jump just amazing reaction time
Is ‘basic high school douchebag’ all that you guys look for on a resume? 😂
‘Welcome back to cringy middle aged tools trying to be cool to impress each other’ 😂
Can someone explain me what "Jeep by two cars" means? I can swear to good that 2 cars wouldn't fit between them...
Choi’s lunches dont look at all rwd
The giant speaker clip where's it from looks so familiar
Can you do a drag Race with @steezaholic ?
Why is Alex chois front wheel spinning if he's only RWD.?
Omg one punch
At 4000 lbs + …. That jeep makes more than 1000 hp.
I dont understand why these dudes don't wear helmets.
It's a half-ter market, haha
About the two cars that wasn’t two cars that was like 10 cars wow
Gonna jump a Lamborghini?
Most Amusing Race
Tri-Vest-A
When the hell has crocks become fashionable for a grown A@@ man,smh.
We want to see jeep again
Sand bagger racing
I want to see Alex's car on here with full power and the AWD fixed
That Lambo dude backed off at the end of the 1st race so he could get the hit on 2nd. Took second race by 2+ full cars, then cleaned up on the 3rd. Playa played him. I'd still take that Jeep over a Lambo.
That lambo was nasty
3:50 A First in this v that?
I voted for the huracan! 😂😂😂😂😂
Wonder what ever happened with the "Tesla Jump" that Alex posted 7 months ago🤔
Bombass race. No way sumn that heavy should be able to hang. Lol but he showed up n showed out. Im impressed.
Jr was all nervous (keep owner ) 😂
“I never bothered to fix it” - well I’m pretty sure it costs more than a hellcat to fix 😆 I can only imagine the cost of this build
More horsepower less weight
The phone charger was functioning lol
Bruh that lambos front tire literally spinning how did he say it was only two wheel drive cap ass race what else he lied about smh can't race Noone nomore cas yall be lien
Dope vid man !
Fyi that Ferrari badge in  the front of the Jeep is a cartel from Mexico
The proper way to flag it’s not going up and then down. The proper way is to point at both drivers to stage and then drop the flags or your hands down. #OntarioStreetRacerCirca1999
Srt Jr 🤟🏻🤟🏻
I see this guy with the Lamborghini  at my job sometimes his car is beast as no cap 🙏
drag racing video yet the actual racing only takes 3 minutes
I didn’t know I was clicking on a video featuring Alex Choi 😂💖
The three Vesteteers!!  "All number one" "One for himself"
another great build by sheepy!
12:50 in your face 😅😂🤣 go back to Mexico jeep
Keep didn’t jump. Just have better eyes. I’ve speed up and slowed down the vid. Def quicker on the draw.
Should bring the guys from onDgas not these knock off wanna be project torque no mames wei no ganan una 😂😂
I’d love to see a match up between a 2022 Ct5 Blackwing and a gtr nismo or demon
I thought I was tripping by taking the Lambo for the win
I thought someone say something about SHEEPY TWIN TURBO Alex kill it
You barely beat an suv Stfu
If you thought that twin turbo brick was winning you’re dumb. He jump cus he scared
These guys need to get midnight performance out here
Jeep did not jump first race. He treed perfectly and Alex slept the drop.
DDE hit with that copy cat flow
Sorry Mr King but A Lambo  will never be in your budget..lol 😂
When will we see the Hoonicorn vs the copo comaro
Hert is the coolest
When we are going to see the hoonipigasus drag racing?
Invite Stradman onto Hoonigan!!
Bro the memes are so underrated n so perfectly placed lmaooooo
Alex vs Hoonicorn would be good
That was the worse flagger on the planet they couldn't even get rpms up for the launch the last race before he dropped his hands 🤦 please hire a street racer to flag.
50kg Asian driver mod always wins..
the jeep launch was excellent
1st race was on the money.  Best one I have personally seen luck or not
9:27 race FINALY STARTS but they let that degenerate Corey "King fear face" back in. God he is useless and a complete fraud. Your welcome
Rematch !!
Still waiting for hunicorn vs crawfish from ondgas
Alex needs to stop double shifting lol
Either Alex is good driver or sandbaggin 🤣 one of the best this vs that
Jeep did NOT jump first race, watch in slow mo.
2010 Jeep SRT8 will be a 100k car one day.
I think Alex has done more offroading in the Lambo than the Jeep has done lol
no jump on race 1 in my eyes, alex was just taking a nap or some
I got a DM me to claim prize it’s has you profile pic is it real or scam?
Anybody else here just skip straight to the races? I do it every time I watch this v that.
What is this shit.
cmon boys the low energy stuff is weak. "wow is that a turbo?!"  "wow is that an engine?! no Way!?"
Ferrari badge!? Numpty! 🙄😂
Now that was a race
That jeep would of smoked him sounds like it was cutting out top end really bad
We need an episode with Tylertrackhack current fastest track hawk in the world
my man has speedtech surface mount lights all over the car... whattttt???
I wanna knownwhat kinda honda that honda fanguy has. Lol. I bet its bad to the bone
That first race, was NOT 2 cars no way man. All I’m sayin is where’s the top down view for the first race. Alex caught him he was on his bumper.
Ok it's YouTube I get but this guy nah
That jeep should do weight reduction and come back for a visit against this lambo
That's my best race ever hooniguys
Ok so is it not super hot in California lol y’all got on jackets
4:05 best feature 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Great episode
Alex lambo vs Dustin R35 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
All yall had the jeep for this, lol. But it's always amazing to see them moving like this, good race👍🏾, congrats Alex🏆
Iv'e seen loads of these, that was the best match up ... period .... the bonus should have been a rolling start...who would have won that one ?
The match 1-2_3😁
As far as I'm concerned the engine of choice for drag racing has, and always will be the Chrysler Hemi. It is considered by many as the king of power plants and it is the only engine design to run a sub 4 second run in the 1320.
hard to admit you like the guy in the metallic purple lambo ever- but Alex seems like a legit cool person :)
Hoonigan team comprises bunch of very boring ppl and with lacking personality.. sad truth
What happened to danger Dan?
For a second I heard “my name is Jeff” lol dope match up
Should've been heads up all three but who cares, great race.
That jeep impressive for keeping up with a 300k plus car
Choi cant drive or raised that boost just to not lose a race.
Its a 1st gen srt8 Jeep.... is it a 5.7 or a 6.1 what!?! Noob....
The next time Alex comes back with the lambo someone should duct tape their phone to the front where the charger is and let him make a pass with it.
I need westin champlin on this show
Hell ya brother
Anyone know the song in the end of the video
That was a dope race best of this vs that
My boy Choi let's goooo
That lambo is so beautiful.
Posted 4 days ago meanwhile they’re practically wearing coats 😐😐
I wonder how much that jeep cost to build, probably under 100k, maybe price of hellcat.
Alex Choi rippin thru gears with no helmet savage
That my the best matchup yet
SHHH ABOUT ‘PILLAR SEATING” LMAO
Good race !!!
Alex Choi is a drag racer now
The One Punch man , Nut shot is the True Winner
That Ferrari emblem, if you know, you know.
This lambo is slow for $$$ spent. Jeep and Jeep driver is with the business....reaction time is insane....
Heyson - Abom 13:21
Not gonna lie but i miss the hoonicorn on track ):
They need stradmans GT-R on the this
nice one again... how about some data like 0-60 ;0-100 and max speed ? I d really like to get these numbers 😃🤫👍
GARY A LEGEND
Epic race. wonder how different it would be if lambo's 4WD works
Race 1 wasn't a jump it was right on the arm drop played it slow mo and you can see he didn't jump win for the JEEP
You need to get something better than these shitty arpeggiated click beats. 😒
alex's car would be perfect without the super flashy wrap but i guess thats kind of his thing
We all know Choi was sandbaggin the jeep 😎👍🏻
Rick Ross said it best  Purple Lamborghini Lurkin!!!
let's see han drag race from fast and furious
Get the real drift king on here.
JR DIDNT JUMP 👀
Does anybody know the title of the beat on the intro? 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
great ISHT TYTYTYTYTYTYTYTYTYTYTYTYTY
Lambo turned up the boost, and up-shifted at the top end to make it close...
texas plates hold it down
That was the shortest "2 cars" I've ever seen, and then the longest "2 cars" I've ever seen.
Lambo for the win.
That Lamb is so sexy.
The guy on the line is bias first it was i 2 cars when it was about 3 cars and after he said a nose when it was like a half car
Alex Choi fell asleep jr didn’t jump
Prediction: V8 is wrong
Lambo got tree’d in race 1 💯
When we gonna see a sportbike vs racecar???
Project torque 👍👍
My dad used to have a supercharged 627 hp Nissan titan with 28 pounds of boost
Don't kill me for this but what's going on with that shifting in Lambo? Is it working like that or is something wrong and have some interruption and cut offs?
Yeah.....! my main Man choi won.
Those two cars were too close to give anyone the hit or jump. Jeep shouldn’t have given the hit to the Lambo since everyone knows the Lambo will reel him in on the big end. That’s how Lambos are geared. Close straight up races.
O herb tem voz d locutor
Freaking sick EP this new generation  freaking dope
Jeep guessed the arm drop and caught him PERFECTLY I don’t call that first race a jump. Also Alex a troll for sandbagging the last run and I would have laughed my ass off if he got passed
Would love to see Hert N Micha do a driving challenge video shit would be legendary!!!🥰🥰🤪🥰
I see Choi, I click away.  How this kid still a respected member of the community is beyond me.
Yeah!.... the first string players are back!
I love my jeep srt8🥺
Alex's mom rules!
Nice to see Alex Choi
Jeep didnt jump first race. 2nd race should have been 2 car lengths for the lambo not the leave.
#Streetspeed717 ZR1 🖤🔥. Please 🙏🏼
Hert is now like when you order a Gary of wish
This episode was so funny. I had to smash that like button. Lambo for the come back. Sheesh!
As soon the Huracan get traction it’s over. If the Huracan had 4wheel drive working it would be diferent.
What was that psytrance song used near the end ?? 13:23
They literally helped Choi win smh
nice cars but really bad race ... tbh. The "docking station" for the phone ... cmon. I have an crazy idea ! Measure the time (best of three)
🤘🇺🇲🤘
Best episode by far haha made me pucker my butthole on the 3rd race 🏁 🤣
Keep Alex fuck dd damon
Yo!! Who is making these beats in the intro!?
Aerodynamics wins
That first race was not a jump.
I’m 10 seconds in and I can tell you almost for sure the lambo has this all day long, they’re not hundreds of thousands of dollars from the dealership for nothing  Edit: thank you very much I’ll take that W
That Lambo is a beautiful colour
even as fuck race!!!!!
Yeeeehawwww yeah Alex Choi.
Bring NoS Energy to South Africa please...!😭🥺
First race from what I can see, the Jeep's wheels were moving oh so slightly before the drop took place. Damn good racing boys!
13:08 😆😂🤣😆😂🤣
Love that lambo power dam right
Best one yet
the day somebody beat tht evo the day i run for president
Alex Choi? C’mon lads!
Alex Choi car wasn’t even at full power lol his awd is broke if he would have got that fixed lol he would have won all of them
My favorite episode so far.
It was cool to watch but need better camera angles of the cars. I feel like you guys spent to much focus on the talking and less of the racing. Maybe drone view or even have an r/c car with a camera follow the cars. Just a thought. What would be entertaining is having a go-cart chase the cars and film behind them (never seen that before). Looking forward to the next race. I was a little disappointed on video but you guys will get a good one next time. I've seen some bada$$ hoonigan  videos in the past. I believe Ken brock did some pretty intense drifting. (Sorry if I got the drifters name wrong, has been a while since I saw the video). 🥸
Gary king Jr is the goat.
Whhooaaa,  luv the bonnet area that charges the 📱 phone!!!🤪👌🤣!! 😎 cool!
Your arm is down when Jeep takes off puro project torque cuhs alv
Lambo more streamlined
Was hoping for some huracan donuts! That was a sick race
Where’s Dan??!!
They should have done a roll race just for fun.
Alex with a win for the Sheepy Race crew! ✊🏽💪🏽
thought the jeep was just all show but that shit movveees😭 props to the owner
I choked on my drink on how good that launch was on that sheep
I like the slammed box truck in the background
That wasn't Jeep by 2
I’m glad hurts back missed him
Now thats a race That Jeep wouldve had EM on a 1,500ft
McLovin out here killing it in the lambo
One of the best races in the Show!!  And lest not fogert The vest name was 🔥  😆
The 2nd race was not as bad as the jump on the first race.  Also it looks like 10 cars or more….not 2.
I guessed right 😎
Definitely not a jump don’t even have to watch it back that was clean
i wanna see more fast VWs
Alex’s reaction time is terrible
Whoa, JEEP did not jump on the first run. Watched it 10 times. Reaction time is flawless.
te lift is off oon them cars but thec  evo got jump if he goes
gotta say, not bad for the jeep! a lil 150 shot of nos-sauze would level it out
What is the all time this/that split? Would be an interesting stat
If they wouldve reviewed the "jump" on Jr on the first round he probably wouldve won
Awd definitely working on the Lamborghini
Set my boy up in the second race smh srt 🔥
That Jeep earned some respect 💯
First Race No jump, it’s in the knees. he wasn’t wearing that 1320 sweater for no reason
CHOI FINALLY WON ONE YEAH
That last one was more than a nose and that second one was 3 full standard car's so whoever is calling it needs glasses ASAP.
Y’all need a rematch. Jeep jumped then lambo jumped. 🙄
alex need to work on his reaction time
Jeep by two cars (literally 5ft apart) Lambo by two cars (2 school busses) Best this v that so far. Close racing is good racing!!!
Can y’all be more crazy and shi that’s shits so funny
You can mess with dde but Alex knows his cars !
Holy shit the Jeep went on the 3rd frame of the hand drop on the first race. That's insane.
2 cars he needs to be fired
EV. Extra vesticles.
Jeep was in limp mode the 3rd race and still almost won
Good Race! That Jeep needs get on a slightly better diet though.
Choi for the W! One thing I know about Alex, he dont lose! OK, maybe he loses sometimes? 😁😊🙏
first round wasn't a jump.  the lambo guy was sleeping
They should do a rematch the jeep is getting a new motor 💯
That jeep is crazy definitely one the first. And second race lambo jumped which was a race and jeep one.
@freddylsx needs a rematch w the new jeep....
Alex Choi is the worst thing to happen to car culture since street takeovers.
Sheeeeesh 😳🔥
The bumper cut on the Grand looks stupid
Man once that lambo caught some grip it would freakin take off. Crazy for rwd!
“Huracan by a nose” and the jeep had the jump…
jr dident jump hes on it them fools just cant let a mexican win 😂
Best race yet. 👌
Alex's reaction time is still trash, good lord.
WOW never saw that coming a Lambo weighing almost as half as much as a 5000lb jeep WON!! crazy never thought I would see the day..... FFS
That was one hell of a race folks!!!
Both vehicles are badass. If I had to choose I would probably take the keep honestly. Idk why but I just have a thang for the srt 8 Jeeps. Definitely one badass ride!!
It’s a Jeep vs a lambo lol regardless the Jeep boogies
Runitback @hoonigan
Wait, is that the Lambo in Hagerty Video getting destroyed by a Lucid Air? LOL
How to make a lambo look like cheap garbage...ffs
Alex's cars lighter with more power. So I definitely give a massive props to that jeep! Damn!!!
A proper tire set up and a working AWD system on that Lambo would make it untouchable
That was the BEST  RACE EVER!
🌹🌹🥰"whoever matched us up"🥰 at the end😂😂
Wait the lambo jumped on the last race hard lol so technically Jeep won!
By a nose more like a whole smart car. Hold that L
First round definitely wasn’t a jump
Gary is a fool lmfao
See you all at the 10 minute mark lol
Hoonicorn vs huracan?
Go to lada niva ,test )))
Hurt...? Whatare those!?
Good job Hurt.
Drag race starts at 9:33
chois is a póser.
I hate all the editing, just leave a camera shot inside the cars and let play out naturally.
Lamborghini guy lied....nothing was wrong with his car
So 2 cars, and 10 cars are equal back to back races? You guys are so full of sht.
More like 7 to 10 cars. For five/six frames, NEITHER car was on the screen!
Hoonicorn vs Rimac Nevera would be insane!
Jeep Should had 500 for that last race. Lol Jeep would had that.
When was this filmed? How are they in jackets right now? Lol 😂
Doesn't matter who won, the fact that a Jeep competed that well against a Lamborghini, I'll take the jeep all day long. That and I probably wouldn't fit in the Lamborghini
Alex slept it
The 3 Vest Friends. Three Vest Dressed.
The most clean race i think i ever seen on the channel. Keep up the good work guys, stay hoon !
That Jeep is moving! Love to see wk1s out there still running hard.
👁️👁️ Peekaboo
Hoonicorn vs choi's lambo
สุดยอด
That Ferrari Badge is 50 xtra horse power. It’s a Mexican thing.
Always been big Fan of this dude so he did inspire me to try to make my [HOONIBOX] become real.
OMG!! WORST RACE NEGOTIATORS EVER!! LOL!! This dude left by, early shift!! Run it back, even, boom! Then see what's up!! U KNOW the lambo will eat this thang! TWO CAR LENGTHS MY ASS!!^^  That lambo was catching up after dude like, hulk jumped at the start. lol \O>
8:43... Wait a minute. As much as these guys build and all the racing experience they got, how the hell is it that AAAAAAALL of them say the Jeep is gonna win? How sway, HOW!!  It's OBVIOUS, light weight, aeryo and hp all favor the lambo. The jeep is awd but who cares?! The lambo will grab, that's what they do, and will eat this under powered and heavier and less aeryo Jeep (in comparison to the lambo). But yeah, I'm STILL gonna watch lol! \O>
0:58... Obviously the lambo wins, lighter and more hp. Sumthin even would be nice to actually like, ad some sort of, suspence?^^  But alas, will I watch? Of course I will, but I would also watch if this was just a one car run with either so... \O>
1st race 2 cars  2nd Race 3 cars  3rd Race 1 car
Jeep ftw
Alex seems quite humble, I don't normally like him
Alex Choi is a complete tool that almost killed a guy on his street bike by driving like a clown
Honestly I’d my soul just to own a car I was proud to drive,,  Any takers 😂😂
Where can I buy some weather where I need a sweater in the morning... Is California getting colder now that all of the hot heads are leaving?
Second race Alex choi burned down jrfab 2 step that’s why he waited for to long
Lol, first race he was perfect on the arm drop. Didn't jump Second Choi won by 2 buss lengths... not "2 cars" and he absolutely cranked the boost after that first race. Lol.
Fuck ya bro i knew alex would win
Really envy people that live like this
Hell yeah raza with the badass builds
That one punch man reference 😂
I was waiting for. “LOOK OUT. NOSSSS”
The Huracan needs an interior refresh.
That jeep was so fast
That first race wasn't a jump, just a great reaction time.
Damn the Hoonigan vibes were immaculate in this one. Much respect
Best race yet.
Please make an episode of Alex choi’s Huracan vs Hoonicorn.
Having recently drank NOS energy drink for the first time, I can say with full confidence that it is very good. Go find a gas station, buy some and drink it. You will probably like it.
I love watching and coming back for more. Thank you! 🙏
The guy with the jeep he’s a Houston tx guy that builds a lot of trucks for racing he’s faster builds are the trucks I would love to see him put a truck against it
Power to weight ratio….Idiots!
I came from the hoonicorn Series, if you happen to see this you should attempt to put it up against demonology's dodge demon
That jeep treed him on the 1st race no jump
I needed a password eight characters long so I picked Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Jeep took the L on last race. If he jumped back to first boost setting like he said that 3rd setting would have killed that Lambo.
Mmmm no 👎 jeep pense ganaria
Take that jeep and put it up against big butty judy
Finally a set of races that was close this was one of the best ones I've watched in a while just because how even the vehicles work good job gentlemen
We want a rematch my boy freddy says
Alex definitely hit the scramble button on that one :D
That Jeep is amazing.
We live in a car society that four figure horsepower races are nothing uncommon nowadays. As my Roman ancestor would say, "o tempora, o mores".
You guys really need to get some AMG’s out to the strip
So the SUV lost because it’s an SUV. That is a waste of money.
Absolutely brilliant
Lambo guy is a tool bag 🙄
You guys need to get the Stradmans Gtr vs Alex Choi
Jeep didn't jump
AWD broken my ass 😂
good race!
Sheepey built baby. 🙏🙏 From the one of a kind civic and integra to 1500-2000hp+ super cars. Love to see it.
What a great match up. Wow. Alex’s lambo leaves so hard for 2wd. Wow.
hit the thumbs up button for a rematch!!! 👍🏾
Alex Choi is a nerd boi
Hurt, I think Tri-vesties would work for your vest gang 😉👌🏻
YEEESSSSS FINALLYYYYY, HERT DADDY!!!!!!!!
Because the middle class can buy a SRT8 all wheel drive Grand Cherokee without being a bougie b**** about a Lambo
Built not bought is it the American way
I just feel like if you own something that cost $250,000 then you should appreciate it because most people's houses don't cost $250,000
You are the epitome of white privilege
Not sure I believe Alex about that Lambo being RWD. I don't see how a RWD car with that much power and those tires could hook up that hard.
Worse than losing a 40 roll to a Camry. That Jeep kicks a lot when you factor in the Aero weight.
👎🏾 more racing. Less talking
They all voted for the Jeep - well because Alex is total D-BAG.  His personality is that of a spoiled 12-year-old.
sheesh
Doesn’t really looked like the Jeep jumped 1st round…
that jeep FORSURE did not jump, Alex just lagged it on that first pass. i saw that at full speed then slowed it down and sure enough, he went RIGHT on the money
Great race 😂
Can someone PLEASE tell me the song they use at the start of the video!
Nasty truck
Oh it is a sheepy
Yall should've got one of those Lamborghini from sheepy built would've worked that truck
Your guy at the other end needs glasses lol
For Hert's information, you can in fact legally tint the front windows in Texas.
Finally! Havent seen a good race on This vs. That in a while.
Give jr fab a rematch and have a light set up no excuses all pedal talk js
Cool races That Huracan sounds amazing Love the SRT Jeeper
💥💥💥
Choi is still driving that old ass 2017 “super trefeo” kit STO 🤣😂🤣
$1000 says alex choi has less than 5 inches
We need to see midnight performance TT f-150 out here 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Puro project torque 🫡
You guys need to get a light or something. But it’s also street racing so..
Lambo vs hoonicorn!
Herts a dipshit, that Jeep was dead on the drop. Choi was sleeping.
We need rematch between the 2, but with a plot twist. Both of them gotta haul a trailer too 😅
SHEEPEEY RIFA
1 car = 2 cars  Bus length= 2 cars…  Half a car= a nose…
Why Alex Choi got on the exact same outfit from an older episode from 2/3weeks ago ahhahaha https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHJy8PM1IaU
Damm that's right El JR. FAB😃
Bring Freddy back  @freddylsx
Why don't you cheap bastards just buy a basic timing system for a few thousand bucks? We know you have the money with 5 million subs.
We need midnight performance or velocity performance on this
Jr didn’t jump he moved when the finger went down that was his win
I feel like the jeep was built by scumbag labs. Seems like their fit and finish quality anyway.
We need a race with stradman’s gtr
Yep, the finnish person needs to be fired!!!!!
Project torque for w no jump
Typical SUV bullshit. Dude probably watches the crossroad's lite at intersections and floors it next to grannies in a manila corollas, tells his homies he won a race on the way over.
The Jeep is getting a new engine, bring them back to race. @jrfab and @freddylsx
Lambo dude looks like a friggin boner with that car.
2jz 335i coming soon yessir
Honestly, it was pretty much a foregone conclusion given good launches and nothing breaking.
There was some serious sandbagging this race. The keep didn’t really stand a chance
The hit was thebd
He didn't jump first race idc
Isn't this the guy who wrecked the Tesla :P
Signing in[] 864 to the 562💯💪🏿🤔💵
good ole J R
Race the food truck
There should be a rematch😈with the Hoonigan’s with it’s new setup on the jeep🔴‼️lit🔥🎥we definitely gotta run this one back💯
That dude Alex makes great content
boomer pink seat belts lol
That Ferrari logo is a narco sign
1:15 aww, matchy matchy on the Besticle vests. Vesticles? Besticle Vesticles BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
I need to find a job with the Lambo dude.
That Lambo is freaking sick looking 😮😮👍👍😀
Alex was toying with the man in red
Best match up in a min💯💯💯
I f’n love Gary!
Alex absolutely turned it up on those last races, like without a doubt. The exhaust note was totally different. Still amazing race and awesome to watch.
How bo for pc ok bro good bye
THANK YOU. THIS WHAT WE WANT EVERY TIME!!!
Jeep had a great reaction on 1st round. Them hands went down and the jeep moved. Don't be salty, Imo. Those were all great races.
yoooo
Giant heavy brick shouldn't even be close against a boosted to tits lambo  , that thing is fast .
Lamborghini equals more money then brains and skill
How could they all sleep 😴 on a lambo
Lambo isn't wild enough you need to wrap it a tacky color . No sense of shame or class . Oh , I see that's his YT scam to get people ro watch .
I’m all for the classic arm Drop but led lights are the new thing folks
I'm super late, but #6 on trending?! Let's go boys!!! 💪🏽
Gaaaaaaahhh Dammnn 🫡 noice race!
This is Alex guy was the douche that was eating on the episode about a month ago with the same Car.
Finally a good match up on this show
The jeep cheated 1st race
Well done Alex. Close race this time. Both awesome cars. Glad Alex won 😁
SRT is Og king
这个小牛刷阶了吗是？
Sandbagging
Always a great show
Sorry #Notsorry but thumbs down on this vid cause lambo's are super aids.. I would not give a flying f-truck if they made 666billion horse puppys it's not cool. 🙋‍♂️🇦🇺
Tri-vesta...
You guys are the 3 very vest friends a guy could have.
Break the Donk out and race it!!!
That jeep is fcking fast no jokes really guys excellent job
The "in-vest-ors"
Jeep is killing it with that weight difference 👌  also I hate to say it but Alex is most annoying character in whole  car community I ever saw .
Does it matter when both of which are slower than a Tesla? Lol!!!!
i hope thailand diesel drag can invite here , (sory bad english)
Bro alex is RWD and still launched that clean. He wins fr
Monster Energy!?!? What happened to NOS!!!!????? Next episode will it be red bull or rockstar? No wait Arizona Tea 🤩
😂😆 no votes for Alex he still lost in my book!
Never doubt the lambo without the max hp let alone part of it put on. Also won with rwd 👌💪
Now that was a race!!
Vestabulls!
11:54 tbh all this time watching those episodes i was asking how the dude comes up with those "2 cars" n stuff cuz it doesnt rly makes sense .. as u can see in this video
As a very very very OLD man once said  "C'MON MAN!!!!"  You guys have to learn to call out the JUMP! The SRT-8 JUMPED the first race MAN!
That's a big nose 😅
I honestly thought this was a re-upload until I realised the other car was different. Whole Alex Choi segment seemed the same :P
Is that a re-upload ?
Project torque 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Hey!! Did you know God is three in one!? The Father, The Son, and The Holy Spirit! Bless him! Jesus died for our sins, rose from the dead, and gives salvation to everyone who has faith in him! True faith in Jesus will have you bear good fruit and *drastically* change for the better!  Have a blessed day, everyone!! ❤
9:24  BWAHAHAHA  🤣
Mate that 1st race was the jeep by 2 halfs and Alex won the next by 4 cars easily that guy say who's wins needs to get fired simple man its to hot for him
Nice vedeo
When is csr 2 gameplay be like  (Sorry i Write incorrect)
1p
My boi choi!
Thank god HURT filled in !!!!  🥹👍 #bring back the old crew
Project torque that’s right
guests are dope hosts are annoying af, is this meant to be a show for 13 year olds?
Why hoonigan did us bad, they didn’t even made alex do a burnout
Damn, takes $300+k to beat a $50k setup 😂😂
I can't be the only one that was looking forward to DONUTS......
He said the purple one too expensive rn i felt that to the core
i would love to see hoonicorn vs alex when alex repairs his awd
Shits so temporary…
props both drivers and thos maddog's car's
man f*ck this sh*t get some f*ckin lights like an actual strip this hand sh*t gotta stop and then a couple metres/yards ahead like 100-150 put another set of lights and those lights will flash if someone jumped at the start.
First one jeep jumped a bit
Lamborghini's second start burned
Project torque keep 🔥 , lambo dope too , good race guys .
Best Jeep ever made
amazing match up. prolly top 5
thats pretty rapid for a rwd
electric turbo with exhaust turbine generator, even shaft generator, twin turbo, supercharged turbo electric generator-turbo combo, no lag non-stop electric turbo
So two cars = to what?  Can't you do time or something more quantifiable?
I love this series!!!! Best break from work EVA😎
Finally a good matchup...
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Best matchup since hoonicorn vs the iroz RS3
One of the BEST match up races ever on the show! 2 great cars and that Jeep can get out of the hole, but that reel in by the Lamborghini. 👌
I'm not going to wait till the end. I can't wait to see this!
1200ish Huracan with only 2 wheel drive and no victory carb circles... WTF?
Bring back the old intro music for fu**s sake....
Was this the first episode that everyone had the same predictions?
Buy two cars if they were extra long limousines
For a 1200hp RWD Hurracan to grip off the line is hella impressive ngl!
Is there any fast Infiniti out there?
Alex  be playing with these people lol
i see Choi i hit dislike, what a twat
Glad this show is back to featuring monsters
Great job JR! Saludos 🔥
Alex choi ain't lying, whoevers calling the finishes need glasses
It’s crazy they all bet on the Jeep…..the Lambo had more power, the bigger engine, the better transmission, and it was lighter…..🤷🏾‍♂️ I bet on the Lamborghini from jump….
*The jeep didn't jump in the first heat he left as soon as his hands started coming down Lambo was sleeping*
Maaan.... Grand Cherokee has been my dream for a looong time. I absolutely love it. I'd love to have one
You guys should try and get Dino and his 8 second WK1 on This vs. That. Now that would be a show.
Fucc boi vs real street racer
They are the 3 VESTkateers!!
The guy calling the gap at the end needs his eyes checked
Go back frame by frame, not a jump. On a hand drop race you move as soon as the hands move down, not when they're dropped all the way lmfao he anticipated the drop and nailed it. No different that guessing a flashlight and moving as soon as the light goes.
I want to see @DEBOSSGARAGE and his Quad Turbo AWD LS swapped Audi Quattro race.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RC5_jzRWq5s&t=115s
Let's get a VR6 race one day. 2.8, 3.2, or 3.6 plzzzz. They sound so amazing and are unique to Volkswagen.
Race 2 was not 2 cars Alex Choi had him by at least 4 cars...the gap was so wide the track was empty for a sec if you pause it @11:24 😂
Now we’re talking
I see that 3 hoonigan staff members can make it to work while they still have a long shadow.
Congrats on 5 million
I love you Gary lol
I have been fast in a hemi jeep, not even a trackhawk, and nothing about the experience made me want to go faster..it felt unsafe, it felt fragile somehow despite just being a passenger..it's just not a vehicle i want to go fast in...1200hp lambo on the other hand, i'm not gay BUT i would literally date anyone with that car.
Pretty tired of Choi millionaire vs normal guys. It’s getting pretty stupid
Last race lambo clearly let off’
DOPE 🔥 U CAN HAVE MY BABY MAMA IF I HAVEN’T THE HARDEST MUSIC OUT NOW NO 🧢
WE WANT A DIESEL MATCHUP
Alex definitely called sheepy 🐑 to get more sauce for his car lol
Give Freddylsx the rematch ‼️‼️
I'm calling shenanigans on the AWD not working on the Lambo
This video was clearly recorded before Tesla jump drama pooh-pooh PP ha ha he he fart noise fart noise
@freddylsx
round 3 fyaaaa
Is that not the smell guy as before and he lied before about it not being awd 🤦‍♂️ also lying about his power very sneaky
It is time for you to approach everything you do during the day consciously. You should constantly control your thoughts and feelings. Any negative thought in your consciousness must be nipped in the bud. Protect yourself from everything that contributes to the existence of negative thoughts and feelings in your consciousness.
Lamborghini needs a driver mod. Dude has zero reaction time
ARRIVA LOS TORRES PRIMO!
Epic,.... 👏👏👏👏
Bring em back awd against a ferarri
Rwd my ass lol.... That thing was coming out the hole. AWD was functioning just fine lol.
I love how everyone acts like they have no idea about alexs car what so ever
Love JR fab 🙏 he’s a good guy and loves all his hard work
Hooligan vs .... series  Staff's vehicles versus.....
That lamb a beast!! But that Jeep came to play ! For sure!!🤘🏼🔥HTX🔥🤘🏼
Where the bonus rounds!? Y'all always have them and this time not even 1? Wtf!?  That was a set up they should have been all hands down racing and bonus some rolls!
1000 hp track hawk🤔
why do i feel dejavu?
Change format to American touge racing
LETSSSS GOOOO CHOIIIIIIIII TAKE EM TO THE CLEANERSSS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Alex needs to turn his lambo up to that 1800+hp and race the 2000hp KONG GT-R . THAT WOULD BE A GOOD RACE!
Team Project Torque
Yesssss
Please, please, PLEEEEAASSEE get with boostedF150 and have him bring the reaper out there and whoop some serious ass!!! I would LOVE to see his truck on your channel!
Slay poupon vs lord frightening.let’s Go
Try a rerdo with out a no bottle    no nossll
What genius thought a tesla was a supercar 💀
Best show on YouTube hands down.
*smise*  Tyra Bank's term for "smile with your eyes" created for the 13th cycle of her hit reality show, "America's Next Top Model"
put some slicks in Alex's car then it's gonna be a whole different story
That jeep is NASTY AF !!! I need to see more
congrats on 5mil
Never bet against Sheepy baby!!!!!!!!😂😂😂
TORRRESSSSSS
When are we gonna get 4k racing
Lol Alex 100% cranked up the horsepower when he couldn't hold off a jeep 🤣
American racing wheels yet neither of them have American racing wheels
Yea i think the dude that describes the gap needs to get fired. The last race was like half a car not nose
dude turned up the lambo, on my life
that's not bad for a bloody tuned jeep
Nobody took aero into account.  Lambo sounds better IMHO.
😄👍
I'm tired of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they are going and meet up with them later.
Hell yeah puro project torque 🇲🇽 @freddylxs 🔥🔥
When can we have a subscriber THIS vs THAT 🤔 elimination battle for say 20k cash prize and we all chip in by paying a 100 bucks to enter, so you profit off it as well?.... seems like a good time if you ask me, what about you @Hoonigan
Underestimated the limbo hard. Knew who won the race by thumbnail lol
Sick ass match up!
Is300 wagon hiding in the back ground 👀
But where's the donuts?
Spotter is blind. Everything is 2 cars…??
THIS was a good race - way better than the last one 😂
Jeep driver wins driver of the day hands down
Finally a race that’s not super one sided 👏🏽 thank you Hoonigan this was a banger 🔥
Looks like these guys hate making these videos now. They dont look motivated or make shit fun or catch audience attention. Boring
"2 Cars" in the second race after what looked to be a full length 18 wheeler. Lmao. At least Choi knows the rules more than this squad does.
There’s always some I love and someone I can’t stand in every one of these races
It was close because the Lamborghini was running rwd on street tires... so bad ass to see a Jeep running with a TT V10
The kid calling hert and hearing the "you wanna go" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jeep was still asleep compared to some of the others that have jumped and got praise for it. Not to mention, why are ya'll telling Choi what to do for the second race? I thought it was drivers choice not lemme hold your hand and tell you what you should have. If the Jeep jumped but Choi had sloppy shifting, then just run it the fuck back. A race is a race is it not? Also what classifies as a jump if Jeep took off the second the hands starting moving down? This channel man, can't decide what it wants people to do.
He for sure pulled out the laptop on a heads up smh
Jeep left frame perfect on the finger twitch, pure coincidence, that was an intentional jump 😂
Jr needs to remove that license plate haha
Bro.... 5,000lbs jeep vs a fucking Lambo with 1200 HP... even if the Lambo won all 3, that Jeep was there. Hemi bro. Mopar or NoCar
It’s my opinion but I really do think that jr won
Alex Choi behind the wheel. Always gonna be a factor. Good race
Alex don't play, he would've gladly pushed the Lambo to its limit 😂
Y’all caller is 🗑 can’t call races.
Great job Alex. The car sounded brutal!
Aqui andamos con en patron Freddy y la mano isquierda el JR.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
That was a fantastic race, one of the best match-up races you've ever featured. Honestly tho I think I  laughed more while viewing this video than I did when watching the actual content.
Well that was fake as hell. Listen to the engines folks. Seriously... listen. Nothing was legit. All good fun, but pure bs.
Is that the same Alex that was about to start crying at that one car meet ? 🤣😂
Saitama... serious series ball buster
Yeah that Lambo 100% got beep booped between rounds
No jump on the first...his reaction was on point!!
boy choi is back
Where's Danger Dan??
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yoo was that mahh boi reef HPA yeahh heard !! 💯 y’all need to get dirty335 on here expeditiously
"You can't legally tint your front windows" -- where in Commieland do you live?
This was great racing
Great races, been a while.  Get the red camo silverado to run the lambo
round 1 was not a jump, slow it down 0.01 speed and you can see the milli sec  his hand goes down, the jeep reacts.
I don't think I've ever commented on any of these videos though I've seen almost all of them, but this one was phenomenal 💪💪💪 probably my favourite
Did Alex drop his pressure in his tires...how did he hook up with all the boost yo?   Yo...word on da street is don't race Choi boy...what you know? LOL For reals tho...
That was a great match up!! Great race!
One of the best races good shit guys
Mommy and daddy's money all in that lambo
The lighter, more powerful, very much more expensive car, beat the cheaper, heavy, less powerful car. Good race, but none of these have really impressed me yet. Calling these outcomes just about every time.
The best match up ever!
I think he went all in with 1700 for the last one
No more Alex Choi
Oh Alex Choi can't stand that kid
Y'all in hoodies in the summer? So much for global warming
NICE!
The win was taken from the Jeep with that dumb negotiation
The worst arm dropper in America
So glad Alex beat the sandbaggers at their own game
Why do you keep doing dumb matchups.... hmmmm... a vehicle weighing half the other with 200 more horsepower... i wonder who will win... so silly.
Round 1 red jeep never jumped reaction time on point
Does the internet still hate this kid?
Editors are hilarious
We want a rematch with Freddylsx
The fact that a 5,000 pound truck was beat just by a nose to a Sheepy twin turbo LAMBORGHINI speaks volumes about that Hemi. 🔥🙌🥵😂
PROJECT TORQUE!!!!!  ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Now that was a good episode!
lol the blurs when he grabbed the tow strap. Gotta love the little details from the editor.
So close!!!!!!
Gotta end the hand dropping b.s time to get drag lights ffs🤬😂
I've seen the Jeep run in person multiple time here in Texas..i mean Mexico..lol..destroying so many guy's from a dig especially from a 30 to 40 roll. Also super cool guy in person but that jeep is no slouch and word on the streets is making more then a 1000 hp. This was probably one of the best episodes/races and equally matched.
Aye he said his Lambo was broke with the same thing the last time he raced on this vs that
Broo yesss!! Missed hert !!!! Let’s goooo
Awesome race! Great pick! You guys need to get Weston and his smoke stang on.
We knew it would be ALEX
Seriously you need a proper tree even the game version is better than the chase is a race!🤦‍♂️
The 'TRIVESTICAs'
what beat beat is that
That jeep weighs the same as a V6 Challenger 🤣🤣🤣
Best ep!
It was fun racing you JR! It was so surreal to be on this channel! i used to grow up watching this
Best Hoonigan race in 2022 no cap💯🔥
God damn Micah can't hand drop for shit!
Run it back
Good race.
Spicy
@freddylsx and jr need a rematch
Imagine if the lambo was awd tho... would have cooked the jeep lol
boringass races....1st one the lambo slept on it 2nd one he jumped and 3rd one was ok but still ass🤣
Definitely best episode yet! Loved it! 👊😎
So this young kid is a spoilt rich kid I hope he's invested money because it never lasts
Rematch 🔥
Finally q good match up .. frig alot have sucked
When are we going to get a Cleetus McFarland and his elcamino "mullet" this vs that
Let super drag bikes race!!!!
#DRUMnBASS
2 cars ??????
Oh they brought back ken Jeong dollar store clone.  Awesomeness!
guy in the lambo looks like hes about 14
I’m appalled that they bet against my boy Alex should’ve known from the last time he was there
the three vest-eteers
That huracan ain’t broke and on  RWD.
y’all got a new editor 😹😹😹
200 more hp, 1.4k lbs lighter, and way more aerodynamic, who's gonna win?
We  need an episode of jrs jeep vs asian jeep
Bro when y’all gonna call me back about that application I did.
Was hoping the Hispanic guy was going to call his Jeep a Yeep. Sadge
A car capable of 1700hp vs a car capable of just over 1000hp (call it 1300)…. As soon as he said what his car was capable of I knew it was game over because he had the ability to crank that shit up and close the launch gap and then some. Good race regardless. I’d like to see truck vs truck, suv vs suv and so on. I think that’d make for some real nail biters
Alex Choi uses daddy’s money
That jeep is fast!!!
It is  July  everyone's wearing jackets  !   WTF  ?
Mercedes transmissions from around that year are quite literally almost bulletproof. They put them into almost all their cars in the early 2000s as well, which paired with m11+ engines, made for very MECHANICALLY reliable cars. They have electronic issues that plaque them but otherwise, they don't blow up or get worn out usually until 400k+ miles. There are teardowns of 400k engines/trannys that look barely worn in lol. The only downside is the shift times, which can be improved like this truck is with a TCU tune, upgraded synchro, etc.
You should have frustratee eg in your show ! Stupid quick awd Honda
Did anyone notice that the Lambo sure seemed to be AWD? If you watch the third race closely, you can see it spinning the front tires slightly right off the line at about 12:24
Rematch that Jeep will beat that supercar #projecttorquegarage#Dammit boy
Just watch the project torque video and that hit race should have never been ran again! Lambo moved Jr took off and they clean!!!
The supertruffleohhhh
That was a real good one
Alex should race again with the AWD working!!
Mamalona la carrera ‼️‼️‼️ un rematch ‼️estaría bueno 🤙🏼‼️‼️
he never fuckin jumped
Why is the hand drop always questionable?
Literally why i never trust any srt/trackhawk jeeps they always have a blower/turbos on the older ones and or crazy high boost pulley on the trackhawks and straight gaptize yo shit no problem.
You guys should just get a light tree. No mess ups. And if staging a car or 2 off set, can just block one sensor, then just wait for other to stage to go,. If that make sense.
Alex Choi outperformed DDE👍🏼
i wanna see theboywiththehonda on here w the black civic
That was a good one.
“2 cars” then “by a nose”🤔🤔🤔
I want to see the Black Trackhawk !!!! That thing is a MONSTER !!!
Yea that was definitely more than two cars 😂
Rematch with @freddylsx
Lambo put all out that juices!
I don’t think he jumped
Give him a rematch 💪
I was excited when I saw this match up
I played it back in slow mo and the jeep was good 👍🏽 not a jump, just outstanding reaction time seriously. Great match
What’s my cousin Alex doing
So nice to see chrysler products lose!
Alex is a fraud
All the sudden Hert shows back up on This vs. That. When Alex Choi shows up in his Sheepeyrace built Lambo!! Where you been Hert. Love the channel you keep up the good work. Good luck Ron and Vin at Bristol racing crownvicks with Cleetus!!
V8! V8! V8!
We want a rematch with @freddylsx
Alex Choi turned that ish up after the first race Lol
Best episode 🔥🔥🔥🔥😵😎
Need to get Asian and farm truck on the show.
Remember that jeep heavy to
Great episode. Great matchup, great editing.
"I couldn't afford the purple one on my budget right now" fricken Gary 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Jr didn’t even jump lol that was right on it
happy alex won, nobody picked him to win
Alex choi is living a dream hahaha just need diffrent seats in hes car tho, cause that yellow intereur no no hahaha
Great match👏🏽
The jeep got the hit in the 1st race how they gonna say the hit is too much 😂
That was a LOT closer than I expected! More of this pls. No victory donuts tho :(
5:09 tell me why I thought he was gonna say “my name is Jeff”💀💀💀
Definitely one of the best races on this vs that
Just imagine if Lambo was in 4wheel instead of 2 😳
TBSS vs SRT8 Jeep
One of the few series or anything on YouTube that I don’t skip through!  Whole staff and editors killed it!  Great race!
Bout time someone called out the person calling these races!! 🤣🤦🏽‍♂️2 cars?!?
My sis had a 1st gen srt 8 jeep na but it was bad ass
Silly jeep, what was he thinking?
my boy @Freddylsx
Nice race!  But Alex does have a point. I too didnt understand the gap comparisons like the first race was a gap by 2 cars? But it was more like front bumper to rear bumper only
I was hoping Alex was gonna be eating again when showing his car😂
Alex beat him everytime with jump both times he got Jeep for the jump still got smoked every race and u guys cheated him car length first race one length sec race four lengths almost 3 race half car to full
That 2nd race was 5+ cars
its hot as balls in texas and yall be showing a vid wearing jackets from a race that happened months ago... wtf
Alex FOR SURE turned it UP. How the 1st and last race start the same but he pulled with an extra 200whp on the last race LOL
Bruh why does Alex Choi say full sauce is 1700hp when he has the Stage 2 1200hp package 😂😂 stop the caaaap lmao
Let’s gooo project torque boyz i hope to see Freddy’s trucks on this show or doing donuts been a fan of them since 2019 boy Freddy
Dude at the end of the track needs to get his eyes checked first race it was one car length and the sec race Alex almost had it by four cars and called it two Alex was right that guy at the end should be fired
JR got the first race but just wait he coming stronger 💪
Ya this vs that dude at the end of the track needs to be fired Alex was 150% right first race it was one car length not two barly then the sec race Alex has it be almsot four car length 3 min and the guy says 2 car length u call that two car length the guy was so far behide Alex’s car was faster simple even first race he closed the gap completely and the sec race he capped him be almsot four cars like come fire dude at the end clearly Jeep lover
What a race !!! That Jeep though 💨💨 carrying all that weight
H yeah lambo
Finally a good race
thats why you go flat plane crank boys, its just superior, especially with turbos
That first race was NOTTTTT the jeep by two cars theres nooo wayy, more like a car Edit: moreeeee races like THISS you cant underestimate the boi choi
They underestimated my boy Alex
That lambo is definitely all wheel drive
Alex Choie lowkey turned it up to 1300-1400 whp for those last 2 races
That 1st race was the jeeps these guys Wilding talking bout a jump
Did Ron turn black? Wtf is going on?
5:13 I swear he was about to say “my name is Jeff” absolutely perfectly.
Can someone tell me wtf a 2 car length is for the first n second race.....?
dammm it jr
wow
Am I freaking out or is the turbo hopping up and down on its own???.... 5:24
My money was on Alex from jump
Great definition of Built vs Bought the Jeep won the whole way let’s gooooo 🦍
A pipe welder made it to the hooningan! And from Texas! 🔥
WE WANNA SEE ALEX WITH AWD
Y El Freddylsx no anda por aca!!! 👈
That lambo is fueled by Ego-85 🔥😂
this is why i want an srt8🤣 at least i’ll be up there with the lambo boys lol
Hoonipig vs Hoonicorn
This was awesome! Seen both these cars on their respective channels before and it's cool to see them run it!
The Huracan can run a 1700? And he was running at 1200 and still won? AH  AND it was hindered being RWD only
To think they all doubted Alex, lol 🤣😂😂😂😂jokes on them... Congratulations Alex!!
Preteen ......is he 12?...🤣🤣
Ban a chase is a race
The jeep won fck that the car is super lite and he’s cocky I don’t like it lol I like them rowdy jeeps packin a hemi
I couldn’t stop laughing this entire episode. Fantastic
Needa throw 100 shot should be good on the jeep
That jeep is moving to be almost 5k pounds
🔥
Puro project torque 🔥🔥
No cage in that jeep is a joke
I don’t think that was a jump, they need to use the flashlight next time
Alex Choi, didn't disappoint.
YES HOONIGAN A TEAM ON THIS VS THAT AGAIN. I love Gary but the b team just doesn’t do it for me.
That jeep spun badass race
Sheepey for the W
I saw the thumbnail and that 2019 tingle in my balls came back! I must peruse this video thoroughly.
Built vs Bought XD  ...bad ass race!
Alex was sand bagging first round
Not bad for a heavy jeep
Hell yeah team Freddy!!!
They need race again
Y’all need to get  @MidnightPerformance from Houston Texas  on here real talk
Gary's energy is what I need....
The car is lighter so good job to jr fab ! That keep a monster!
One of the best truck ever on show we want rematch they got faster engine in jeep ❗️
Freddylsx🔥
The crew was really in the zone on this one great video
Bro jake pauls lambo vs alex choi we be awsome
Thank you to the editor that didn’t blow up my ears during the celebration! Another great episode! Evenly matched cars
Yo he had him by 8 -10 cars on that 2nd one smh
Y’all need to get Freddy and his Project Torque crew out more when there trucks are back up to 💯
The fact that the Cherokee has the same steering wheel as my sister in laws jeep commander is wack
No jump. he timed that first one perfect
Y’all need to call up farm truck 👍👍 street truck…… right…..
Hertz is back!!!
Finally a proper fare race
Alex has had that car badass for a while now.
Go back and watch the finishes.  Those were NOT even finishes.  first race, by a car and a half maybe.  Second race was by like 4.
Full Tilt "1700" LUL . . . . Hmmm
Love to see how some of the cars and drivers would fare on a track or short course
helmets guys :)
Rerun the kings @projecttorque
👏👏👏
Alex is just a cocky dick head that came from money so he doesn't know how to race
Straight up beast episode.. they all guessed wrong was the best part
I need a beater Lambo!
Nice to see Alex not stuffing his face while doing an interview.
The Jeep is still 10x cooler.  Supercars fucking suck and are lame. They have no soul nor character. zzzzzzzz
Race starts at 9:30
Whos not gonna know those guys , texas cars & trucks are the fastest street builds and the state of racing scene , puro texas cuh 🙏🤘
"There are two sheeps." DAAAAAAAAMN, he did let Hert run into a wall without even skipping a beat! 😂😁😇
🤏
Now THAT was a race!! Hoonigan editors *crushing it* as per usual.
람보르기니 대 suv
Yet another this vs that I will not watch due to Alex Choi being in it. It’s unfortunate you keep bringing him on here. He’s a stain on the car community
Great matchup!
Is 1500 out of the choices cause someone almost hit the fence at the end?
such a good, good episode.
that jeep is DOPE fellas!!
Already knew Alex was gonna win 🤣
wait until the tiktok kids learn choi has a rep body kit 😭
The Jeep didn't jump, he left at the instant the hand dropped.
Is it just me or was awd working on the Lamborghini on the last run front tire definitely spun on take off 🤔
That was not a jump he saw him start dropping his hands and took it  It looked like a jump because Alex pretty much slept on the line
Alex.choi 😻
Imagine Alex wit awd working
His car is awd quit the bull shit
The lambo being 1200hp sure hooks pretty well despite it having rwd only.. amazing..
Lambo is Lambo but the Jeep's the really impressive car.
NO DOUBT THAT LAMBORGHINI WAS GOING TO WIN! Even with bad start (at the final race) he won (being rwd too)
Senile guy once had one bad ass mustache.
I enjoy all the videos, but the playback quality is crap. Please make future videos in 4k.
Between the 2, I'd take the Jeep as a daily driver 😎🤙
Keep up the good work guys! 👏
Alex is SO CRINGE bro ... definitely hitting the up horsepower button and unless yall get the pink gtr back on here the dude will keep upping it to win until he cant no more...just the kinda dude he is
You guys should do supervan vs hoonicorn mustang
The 3 VESTiteers? 🤔
You already know the next episode is going to be hilarious
I’m proud that both cars were built by Latinos and they give us a very good race
Lamborghini winning this 1👿
Didnt jump
Both builds are wild
As soon as Rafa spoke with an accent I knew who I was betting on 👌 that Cherokee is dope
These mfs stay jumping 😂
First race both where at 1200 hp JR’s at 1150 and for the rest of the race Alex Choi definitely turned it up to id say 1500hp
Get those two a snickers bar they clearly hangry....
that jeep is making WAY more than 1000hp to keep up with a car that makes 1200hp, weighs 25% less, and is infinitely more aerodynamic. GREAT episode.
The Jeeps Round 1 launch was SOO spot on they thought he jumped 😯 Good 💩 JR 🙌🏾👏🏾
Golly just ONCE would like to see someone sit there and NOT bite on a jump start. [ala not chase to race]
These absolute idiots thought the huracan should get the hit after nearly beating it the first time.
Good race, but the dude at the end needs glasses, idk wtf he was lookin at
I agree with the folks saying best head-to-head this vs that ever first of all. Second of all that hurricanes transmission is so fucking angry I don't know if y'all can hear it throughout the whole video as he's racing it doesn't know what the fuck to do
Dopest heads-up in a minute! That was real racing
You guys need to have lights at the start...!
I love the chaotic intros to this vs that. The beats and editing are always on point imo. Please Never change hoonigan.
Best race since the rs3 vs the hoonicorn
Alex Choi is the hustler of all hustlers. Boy knows what he's doin for sure
Second race is more like 5 cars lol, first race not even 2 cars.
That jeep
I still remember when choi pulled out in front a bike nearly killing him and some girl giving him an earfull
Easy top 3 this vs that race
I can't believe how good that lambo hooks in only Rwd 🤔
6:17 😂😂😂😂✌🏻
I’d be ashamed if my half million $ plus car didn’t gap that Jeep 😬
P.S. I fixed the all wheel drive half way through this
“In-vest-men”   You’re welcome.
the jeeps awd and his lambo is rwd so obvi the jeep would prob win
That Jeep guy is chopping trees. I knew the Lambo would reel him in but damn that was a good pair of cars this episode.
That lambo is porn 🔥
Hurt is back!
that episode was lit
Puro Pinche Project Torque!!! 💯
Alex hurrican it’s not evil it’s just 2018 Lamborghini huracan LP6-4
What do hoonigan staff daily? Actually.. like you should show us without letting them know.. Btw I hate these new gen lambo kids
Lol Chris from SupercarSuspects just randomly in the video for a quick second lol
We need OnDGas’s Silverado vs Hoonicorn.  Best matchup in This vs That history!
I swear i saw the front tires of the lambo spin👀
Crazy how good content it is when they evenly matched
Instead of vesticles, since there were 3 of you it should be the trivesta 😂
"This looks like some shit we would put together. Exposed relays, duct tape haha." Shots a Sheepey?? Or other shit Alex has done himself?
Had to turn it up to win but nice race
Im not even 100 sure that Jeep jumped.. looked like a PERFECT start...
Never ever call that a cherokee it's a grand cherokee.  Totally different
Theyre the Trivesta ;)
I cruise at 96 horsepower. 😎😁  .....ssssccrrruuubbbb 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
I love the Choi videos
yesss fk that trash less gooooo alexxxxx
Honestly, Lambo almost lost just on getting tree'd twice alone. Massively respectable display from the jeep's driver. If he jumped the first race, he was right next to cutting one hell of a light, as it were.
Could’ve totally called yourselves the tri-vesta
Alex your coat tail rider of dde give them a shoutout minimum
REEF @threedirty5 EPISODE LOADING!?!? 👀 🦾💯🙌🏾 💥
Love how only in drag racing.a chase is a race.every other race it’s cheating.🤣
Team project torque 🔥
“1200”  u know he turned that up a couple hundred after that first race
A Lambo beat a jeep go figure 😂
Clean first race, no jump. Got him on the tree 🌴
Alex definitely full sends everything he owns
Choi on the Jeep's bumper after a chase "2 cars" Choi winning by 6 cars "2 cars" Choi by half a car was "by a nose"  Seriously what the fuck is with that dude
Jr fab/project torque 🤌🏽
The Jeep didn't jump that first race, or hardly did. Watched it back at 1/4 speed and he left just as Micha's hand started to drop.
The first rule to racing.... lie about how much power you make. Everyone should know this.
Whoever said the jeep was ahead by two cars in the first round needs to be fired lmao
Finally, my actual favourite hosts are back, I love you zach, here and micah, + Ron, vin, and scotto.
Awesome
I’ve always wanted one of these jeeps. Decided to get my SHO first then when I came back to look at the SRT8 it had gone up 10k all around the United States 😐 edit: yall need to start REQUIRING HELMETS!! Idc what excuse you guys have. You guys won’t be happy when someone bust there cap open from crashing or smacking a roll bar.
Those shoes 🤣🤦 just no
Nice lambo 🇺🇸👍
Seems like the "drag racers" always jump lol.
Lamborghini definitely beep boop for more power.
this shit was funny as fuck and the race was lit
I'm here
That cut scene where one punch man hit that dude in the dick!   Lmao
Das a race boyy
😂🤣😂🤣 The nut shot from One Punch Man...too funny.
best race yet!!
Didn’t look like a jump on the first race. I think Alex was just sleeping. Second race, Alex had him by way more than 2 cars. Last race was nice. 👍 Great video guys.
@freddylsx wants the rematch😶
“I couldn’t afford that on my budget right now “ …. I felt that lol
That SRT just f$%ks off!!! What a machine!!!!
That jeep sandbagging his HP lol
Alex clearly turned the car up alot u can hear him sandbag at the end
Not a Mopar fan but i do have a thing for those 1st Gen SRT8 Jeeps
Bro 1700 HP on Alex’s Lambo imagine he was using that
That went way better than expected
The second race huracan probably won by 6 cars lol
Also, if I owned that Lambo, I’d be damn embarrassed.
Lambo dude is right, the person saying people winning by car lengths, doesn’t know what a car length is.
Alex can sure drive around a fast jeep
Ask @fireball with his daily driver 😉
That 60 foot
Badass JEEP
Look guys I can hold my right foot down in an automatic!!! lmfao
Fuck ya!!!! Dammmm this is fucking Epic, by far the best race of this season,
Choi Vs DDE 720!!!
TVT tournament please. That's the ish I wanna see
Can we just get a LA vs Houston shootout. please.
Glad hert dog is back... !
El compa JR fabs
2 sick cars! Both winners if you ask me. :)
I checked in slo mo and the jeep had an absolute perfect start
I don’t think the Jeep jumped on the first race.  I replayed it in slow mo and he left right at the moment the hands started going downward.  Definitely some luck involved in the timing but I don’t think it was a real jump. 🤷‍♂️
I was rutting for the Jeep. I always gotta go underdog street build. That was hot, good race👍
JR took the W on the first race nice and clean!
crocs are fire
Now let’s see that hemi in the damn lambo 🫡
Alex straight up got his mommy and daddy to pay for the car so who cares lol
Hurican didn't need the hit on round 2 lol
Yo the blurplegeenie could confuse the F@@! Out of cops
This was a good one👍
200 more hp and 1400 lbs more lighter. 🤷🏻
We want a rematch
Woow 200hp and 635kg difference. Double Fail 👎🏽
"both with all wheel drive" uhhhh....
mopar doing what mopar does best!
jjeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep
When he said he had 1.8k on tap... Yeah but I'm sure the srt had some on tap too I'm pretty sure it wasn't 1800
Nobody enjoys anything Alex Choi
The rolls versus the sky lightning
Best match up ever now need to have Cleetus Mcfarlands el Camino on the show
Two cars?… Really?
Whoever is flagging needs to let the big turbo cars get up on the 2step.
Hoonicorn would definitely kill that  Lambo!
Hoonigan y'all rock! That Sheepy race Lamborghini Alex's got is a bad mf! He had to chase that Jeep down but did! Love the channel and content! I'm here for the algorithm! Peace
He didnt jump it, jeep went as finger went down.
vesticles and the hurt
Where the fuck are the donuts???
PROJECT TORQUE
Bring farm truck & AZN on the show!!!
alex definitely hit that 1700 hp button
Really happy to see these Texas street racers and their "chase is a race" talk get beat.
Felicidades JrFabs for making it in to the show and giving a competitive race.
Crazy how much awd helps in dragging, Alex was a whole 2k more horse power and 1400 pounds lighter, and it was still a Great race
If choi kept it fair and didn’t turn it up he would of kept getting smoked even with the hits lmao 🤦🏾this what makes racing boring and lose the name when people lie and sandbag
Alex Choi is an egotistic maniac
In all respects Alex the last race he peddled the throttle after he was in front so that made it seem more competitive lol
DDE'S 720GTR vs Alex Choi's hurracan?
The jeep only had 1 thing that gave him a advantage from thr Lambo and yet it was such a close race that jeep is insane
ALEX beating the odds. Best race i've seen in a while
Alex Choi will always be stuck in my head for almost killing a biker by being a f***ing idiot for a video
Tri-Vesticals
No donuts?! Alex can do that….
Freddylsx
Whoever edits these videos needs to get payed more
That wasn’t a fair race the guy in the Lamborghini definitely had more than 1200 hp he was lying.
What's the benefit of being dishonest it was more than a couple cars it was a bolo maybe even three freaking dude
I love they all bet on the Jeep and Alex spanked em
I really really really love the videos. A lot of awesome and unique vehicles. But I realllllllllyyyy miss seeing the Hoonicorn go down the road. Will it ever be back?
Other than "Bragging Rights", there should be some type of prise for every Winner. And then break it down "Bracket Style" to the FINAL TWO (like a series)!
“xtra 50 hurspurrs”🙏🏽
el compa Rafa with the double cup on deck sheeeesh
Bad ass race but we need to have the rematch when JR fab gets his new setup from LME
No shot that Lambo is RWD....
Hoonigan needs to invest in a tree!
the music these guys get, IS ALWAYS FIRE
I love how Alex's cars always trashed on the inside lol.
Front diff wasn't working my azz. That lambo would have gone up in smoke on that surface.
How did they all bet against Alex?  They definitely haven't seen his stuff.
I NEVER doubt Alex Choi's ability to prove the Hoonigans Fooligans LUL
Hell yeah jr jeep is killer 💯🔥🔥
@freddylsx want to rerun with the new setup
To think that jeep can keep up to the lambo is unreal lol!
6:20 ture Mexican spirit
Interesting..So AWD is approximately worth 200hp, 635kg,Faster Shifting, and the low end power of a bigger engine.Crazy.
PROJECT TORQUE🙌🏽 🇲🇽
Wow Alex jst did the unthinkable 😂😲🙆‍♂️.. Nobody said he'll win but he did 😵 crazeyyy
Why do ya'll act like you've never seen that exact lambo on this vs that or knew about that same hood phone charger. Just be natural. Kinda a turn off. I'm sure I'm not the only what that feels the same.
2nd run was much more than 2 cars, and the final race was definitely more than a nose 12:49 if u pause carefully u can see the Huracan is completely through and only then is the jeep nose crossing the line.
and one week later the kids lambo got 2000h:D
That was a dang good race probably the closest one yet.
1200hp on a stock engine, damn, these audi v10s aint no joke
Are you guys always cold?
I’m so glad that Alex guy called them out on the guy who they have at the line saying how much they won by. He is crazy inconsistent and it bothers me in every single episode, no way both those distances were equal yet said they were each a 2 car distance, and then in the last race Alex won by a car and the guy said it was by only the nose 🤦🏻‍♂️
Why would you hand drop so suddenly like that the last round? 🤦
That jeep isn't breathing right. He's bogging.
It’s a plain huracan! A body kit doesn’t make it a super trifeo, Choi is a idiot
"He bleep blooped" after that second race ahahahaha
Day 4, Bring back Hert Break!
@Freddylsx
alex choi definitely put the next stage on & turned on AWD for that last run. check the wheels spin in the front. it’s ever so slight but it’s there! can’t trust any of these youtubers haha
@freddylsx wants a rematch with the jeep
Was this filmed months ago. How are they wearing jackets. It's not cold
The brick on wheels aerodynamics is what messes it up but he still got it on
Sheepey putting in work
Y’all better change yo person at the end
more like 2 buses on rd 2 lmao
We need to see the white pit truck and the diesel camaro or did everyone else forget about them!?!?!?
Id Love to see that Cherokee at the tire slayer yard
The Michael Jackson meme was hard AF!
el tio borrachales se la rifo 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼la jepeta biene con todo
Man’s was just testing him … then he turnt it up 🤣
Second race was more than 2 cars 😒. More like 4-5 cars 🐑
Bro it’s ait I guess but project torque got it
I'd give the overall win to the jeep, just cause Alex is a poster child for douche canoe kids
I read MAMMA CHOi and PAPA CHOi funded 1200 huracon evo
We need a episode where the hoonigan staff races each other’s to see who’s the fastest car lol. An episode with all you guys and your builds would be cool.
vestes
Alex is the best....love this episode
yo where is danger dan at? he's been MIA for a FAAAT Min.
Its known that TURBO huracans/R8 = force to be reckoned with. Props to that jeep owner  that it can keep up, nicely built
Why don't people build Hemis as much as LS's? I really want to know.
Told you Lambo/Audi  big ups!!
Yall should do the crawfish from ondgas vs the lambo next that will be a good race!!
For the jeep to have the aerodynamics of a brick it did great
Who came here to see if he crashed?
Dope. Y'all should add a speed trap at the end. Would be nice to know how fast they get. Or is there some legal issue?
After that first race the hurricana turn up the power
REEERUNNNN!!!
'Broken Haldex controller'
Stuck around for the Bonus round and Winners Donuts, but it was missing >.< Solid round and content as usual though <3
I’m going with a Lamborghini it’s gonna be harder for him because it’s all wheel drive is not working still going to the Lambo
Wow again the Car with more hp an less weight won wo would have thought.
Who be made the beat for the intro?
Does anyone know how often This won and how often That won? fells like every time i watch it This wins ^^
Didn't read title saw the car    Ohh Choi is back !! Click
They should have brought ramps to jump the EVO just light the suburban streets of LA
Mini heart attack when the Lambo hit a boost cut in the final round
Dam good race!.  Good job!.
THREEDIRTY5😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
Can’t lie the dude at the end of the track needs to be replaced
Now we need to see the jeep turn the bottle on
it was obvious who was going to win. I called it from the start. I would have made an easy $%
What an ugly car…     next to the Jeep!
Trivesta!!! For Zack,Hert and Diaz
I had no clue hert had a twin wtf I thought I smoked too much weed before watching this
I'm not a big fan of Choi but I knew he will win at the end somehow. This car has a lot of cash in, when he realised the power of the other car he knew how to deal with it.
It’s the same transfer case that goes in diesel rams it’s safe to say they can handle some torque
No donuts? awww
Good to see homie Jr 👌
@freddylsx and the whole crew want a rematch with the twin turbo jeep 👍🔥
Alex won the 2nd race by at least 3 1/2 cars so yeah terminated asap
Props to Sheepy Race!  Very jumpy race- well played. 😂
Freddylsx
Puro Project torque JR gave the guy all he could handle Texas Made.
JR jeep 🔥
That Jeep
i wish you guys would learn to flag a drag race lol, 0.5 sec to build boost is no bueno.   Watch one episode of Americas List and start flagging better please.  Amazing content other then scrubflag
One of the best Races in a long time!🔥
Project Torque FTW
Damn no donuts this episode that’s how you know this was a good matchup
Imagine having a 1300hp lambo and sweating when matched up against a chrysler jeep
Alex by 2 cars?? More like Alex by 2 football fields. Definitely needs to he fired
“Jeep by 2 cars” ????? What. That first race the Jeep may had half a car maybe a car
“If he didn’t jump that would’ve been a clean race” yeah hert duh 🤣
That came down to aerodynamics.
That Jeep is fast AF 😂😂😂
Said it on the last video with him in it. Fuck Alex Choi.
that is a neck tossing back reviting hell breakinfg mf lambo jet
Idk why they were saying Jeep jumped on first race...perfect tree.
This bou Alex finna kill Someone else y’all better stand back
Good match. If rj with the jeep work on aerodynamics and stance, that would have given him a better ability to reach a higher speed in shorter time....but just my opion.
i kinda wanna see alex choi Lamborghini vs the hoonicorn
kinda an even race. jeep guy caught alex by reaction time.
Love these Jeeps!
I want to see Ken in the hoonitruck vs Lia in the hoonicorn
Nobody   Zac, Hert and Micah : 🕴🏻🕴🏿🕴🏻
That Lambo is fuckin ruined
Bruh everybody talking about "jeep got walked" It’s a 2018 lambo vs an 06 srt8 jeep  For an 06 jeep to keep up with a 18 lambo that’s crazy🔥
No way the race should've been this close with the stats of those cars
Finally a superb matchup! Great racing!!! Why did I feel like the Jeep was just making a whole bunch of boost but, the engine couldn't handle it?   Great race!!!
Did ZACH of all fucking people.....censor himself!?!?>!?! What has the world come to this dude can't even say homie got no fucks to give !!!! RIDICULOUS!
Reaction time vs mis shift I mean you gotta be ready ? Or I’m I wrong but either way great race
U liar😑..its not a phone charger
Lambo only RWD? Hmmm…
El tio Borrachales 💯💯💯💯
13:46 i dont think he watches the show hes one
I miss the hoonicorn race
OK inmay be crazy but Deja Vu hard-core, then the phone charger, and I was 100%
No era penal
Alex Choi definitely turned up after the first race 🤣🥱
That huracan trans is on its way out
You sould call Beto with the Silverado
That’s bad ass jr fab !!!!!!! Project torque for the w for being on the show again !!!
How? How ? How ? How is it even this close of a race lol 😆.
Playing back at 0.25 speed on Youtube, that Jeep had near perfect reaction time first race, the millisecond the hand went downwards, he left. I say no jump.
Why do you guys bet against German cars 🙄
Aerodynamics play a huge role
Yall need more trucks from project torque on here
Big body can move!
Alex Choi...how to say you have money without being a snob or a Richard....awesome personality in a guy with that much money
That first race looked clean to me.  No jump.
Freddylsx
Juicy
Alex is so lit hahahaha
TransVESTtights 😂
Soooooo...what is that intro music? I need more of that in my life
🔥🙌🙏
JR didn’t even jump, that reaction time was damn near close to .01!
I like it that they let Xibit be on the show 🤣😂🤣😂
Lol are we not gonna acknowledge how Alex let up a bit on the last race so itd be a closer finish 😂😂 that boy knows his racing
Dude who calls the gap at the end of every race calls everything a 2 car gap
We need Alex vs Hoonicorn
Didn't they upload this previously?  Edit  Different video but awd was broken then also wouldn't be surprised if they filmed same day  https://youtu.be/iHJy8PM1IaU
I'm going for Alex choi
Always wanted this generation of jeep with the SRT8 trim. Was so cool to see those badges on just about every dodge/Chrysler. Like who doesn’t want a SRT Crossfire???
This was great but next one looks amazing
goddamn im glad alex beat that jumpy douche
You guys clearly haven't seen this Lambo in full force, otherwise you wouldn't even have thought the Jeep had a shot.
That lambo absolutely FUCKS especially for RWD. Lets goooooo
i'm gona play need for speed after the show
Best soccor moms car 🍆💦
Next episode bouta go viral wit a POW!! Lol
Top tier edits 👌Best race in a while!!!
Has to be one of top 5 races on the channel
HOONIGUNS camera angle that you shot at 11:18 should be cloned  and placed right at the finish line where speed is even Crazier, this kind of camera shot is top class, how else to put it?
Yo the editors are fuckin hilarious lmaooo the turbo noises clip and fake michael Jackson clip 😆😆😆
Freddylsx and jrfab wants a rematch
who ever picked the music selection. chefs kiss
Puro JR FAB & Project Torque! 🔥🔥🔥
Thank you Choi for the supercar community another W
Huracan BOOGIES for RWD
More Choi on the channel
Good races
Jeep was too chonky
U really think choi was gonna loose and say hes only using 800hp to 1000hp then turns it to 1250 ..sneaky little snake
That was a good race. I can't believe that the Jeep being as heavy as it is runs with that 1200hp Lambo like that. That Jeep is bad---ass!
That was crazy project torque all the way
We need a 2,500 ft strip!
ŁOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Not one person picked the TT Lambo? Y’all crazy
Jeep looks like it didn’t jump lambo slept
Let's go Alex!!!
Hoonicorn should have been there .. Choi could sucked some methanol fumes
Damn that was good.
Thats right thats all what @sheepyrace does WIN WIN WIN 💯💯🏎💨
What would happen if the lambo was all AWD . I think the lambo would kill it
Nice runs but cant compare the weight diffrence and prices on both cars
1. I would like to see a replay on that Jeep's reaction time. I don't think he jumped the first race. 2. Alex sandbagged that first and third race.
Go Choi and hoonicorn!
LOL you guys thought fast people jump? Nah.. just the slow, scared ones.
wow tht was much closer than i thought
Freddy and jr want that  rematch again 😈🔥🔥🔥
Shit what a great race, these things get me so hype. Gotta get more real street racers out here!!
the midnight performance f150 handles la choy boi.
On this episode of the Hoonigan Lunch Time Launch. The entire crew loses their lunch money to Alex Choi.  I was not expecting this!
Don’t mess with sheepy builds!!!
Finally got to see the 3 round sections at the bottom I was like ooooh this is gonna be gooood
hoonigan just made it to the damn 5 million subs
You should get frustrate eg and gtr texas killer to race! That should be interesting
When a big hulking behemoth rolls up the line line you know you're either gonna crush him or get blown the fuck out.
I just want to know what song they used on the last drive back at 13:22
@freddylsx & JR Fab wants to rerun that lambo with they new setup! Let's make it happen! Love to see another bad ass race!
Props to the family home giving that lambo a clean fight.
More like one car lmao
That fuckin jeep is fast and the driver can DRIVE, not many people ive seen on here actually time the hand drop just right.
Now that was a race & a half
Freedy lsx & jr want a rematch 🫡
You know Alex is lying about not having all wheel drive or all the power
The jeep didn't not jeep
Holy sh**t , that Jeep can boogey 😎
Hell yeah.. excellent race .. the Lambo is nuts (to be still driving, lol )
I don’t think ppl appreciate the onDgas remark he fabs for them
Them Texas boys DONT PLAY AROUND! That Jeep shakes and bakes down the track like El Diablo himself is after it !
I think Zac is allergic to NOS! It breaks his brain.
We need a HOUSTON VS EVERYONE episode!!!
That the best rear wheel launching lambo I seen damnn alex nice!
The person giving the measurements at the finish line is blind
Alex Choi is just some kid that got everything from his rich parents
Rematch jr fab he getting better and faster @freddylsx
Is he positive the AWD is broken?
Best episode ever
Personally I think a 10mph roll race is what people should introduce into these head to heads . It will eliminate the drivers launch and if someone’s auto or manual… would be more about the car and not the gearbox / driver 👍🏻
Holy fuck! jR fab’s JEEP took off crazy Af !!!! Can’t wait for him to have the new LME engine in there and see how insanely it takes off
Great video - I’d like to see more high hp Mitsubishi Evos tho … I mean who doesn’t 😂
Jeep a beast
I had to slow that down to 0.25 speed. The dudes front end started lifting the exact moment he dropped his hands on round 1. DAMN!!!!
Now we need to see Alex Choi's 1200hp Huracan Vs Damon Dryer's Huracan
Who bets against a huracan with twins?
alex reaction is just wow
literally seeing this matchup before I clicked on this video make me so hyped this is gonna be a sick episode
Alex choirs Lamborghini is no jioke
The edit with the kids on the phone and Hert saying “you wanna go!?” was absolute gold😂
I knew Choi was gonna win 😂😭🤣
Really a 1,200hp RWD lambo hooking up like that.  I'm calling B.S Seems to me that AWD system was working just fine. Otherwise that Italian Volkswagen would've been roasting it's tires the whole way down the track.
I know jrfabs is getting a new faster setup soon.
The fastest episode (yet?)
Gymkhana this vs that??????
Alex nailed... whats your definition of 2 cars... seriously that first win wasnt two cars and Alexs first win was definately way more than two cars surely... anyways that freight train from Alex and to rub it in by short shifting as he was going past lol
That's right !!! Puro project torque  That jeep is a monster 👹 !!!
Get them back in there the vibes were unreal
@Freddylsx
Ei?? tutto figo, tranne il COLGIONE che guida la Lamborghini.
One of the best episodes ina while! 🔥🔥🔥
Race them again know with the new lme engine 😈
So this actually should be named as bought vs built.
@freddylsx
Alex has been 🧹⬆️ here recently
Whoever at the end of that track needs some glasses 2 cars lol
Badass race
His "AWD" wasn't working? So you mean to tell me what a guy with zero drag racing experience and a high horsepower  car with not a drag radial or any type of drag racing tire on it dead hooked every time on asphalt? I mean I'm damn near amazed that somehow that thing didn't smoke a tire not once... Y'all really do suck at pairing up vehicles
The lambo did not need a damn hit second round. Cmon now y’all used to be fair now y’all choosing winners
Salute Texas Maybe, double cupped, seat lean, sun roof open 🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿
@FreddyLSX
Nice race!
I absolutely lost it from 11:33 to 11.43. That One Punch Man clip was on point hahaha
#freddylsx
The Lamborghini guy is a liar thsts awd 1200 rwd with street tires is not leaving like that idc 😂
I wanna do an unpaid internship with hert.
6:52 the guy crouched on the left side almost fell over and tried to play it off lmao 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Last time Alex saw a jump that big, a Tesla was writing off some dude's car.
Hit markers never fail 😂😂
Yet another video for enjoyment, but time for business as usual……Racing SUV huh,…..seems a good match for a RACING TRUCK……HOONITRUCK appears.
You should call yourselves "The Vesties"!!!! 👍
Awesome
12:44 either Alex shortshifted or jeep pushed the nos, awesome race
Name suggestion! The three vesketeers!
12:44 either Alex shortshifted or jeep pushed the nos, awesome race
Monica NOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
i love the marathon ep of the league. good clip insert
@freddylsx
God that was sick! Never seen every single host be wrong before lmao. Editors crushed it too!
Anyone else tired of hearing trap beats in literally anything from events to commercials and yt vids? The genre  was shit from the get go.
Was it a jump? He left as the hands were coming down.
My 130hp focus vs nads civic lets see it
At last Choi wasn't eating lunch in the middle of this race (like last time).
another thing too, you guys HAVE to bring alex choi back VS Damon's 720S GTR once the 720S GTR is done. back me up hoonigans!!!!
2nd race was like 5 cars
The jeep didn't jump in the first heat he left as soon as his hands started coming down Lambo was sleeping 😴
i dont care what happened ... mexican guy all day
Alv Jr anda recio
all the homies love alex choi
if alex had that 4wd he would've walked away with that W even easier
What a fuckin race but that wasn't two cars but sure keep races like this comin that was the best in ages 👌
I cruise at around 80hp lol
I can’t see Alex and not think of a Tesla launching itself through the air 😂
el tio borracho gappin lambos
Lambo all day every day!
Aye that chinito had a secret NOS compartment hidden somewhere
Jeep got walked 😂
thats one angry lambo
As soon as dude said he jumped a lil bit but got you by 2 cars. Lmao how y’all racing? Dude jumped he lost line back up do it again.
WHEN JR PUTS IN THE NEW 426 motor he about to DO SOME SERIOUS DAMEGE 🥹
Glad y’all picked a Dodge for him to race, all the bull shit he talks
You mfs smokin crack slow down the first race and you’ll see that as soon as Micah moves his hands the jeep starts moving, props to the jeep for a 10/10 reaction/anticipation.
That was a good race!!!
Jeep takes cool factor over that ugly ass matchbox
Nice run that Lambo Alex got is a beast 👍
HOOOOOOO boy, when alex shows up with a twin turbo huracan, YOU better have your seatbelts on!
Good stuff Alex! Sheeeeppppppp
Puro pinche project torque alv 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A rematch once Jr fab gets his new setup !!!!🔥
Lambo.........200 HP advantage, 1200 lbs lighter and better aerodynamics.  Im not surprised at the outcome.
Dodges are so ugly
Alex is correct. Who ever is saying “by two cars” definitely needs to be fired smh 🤦‍♂️
You know the Lamborghini turned it up and then let the go gas’s at the end. I want to see the Jeep use a good 250 shot or more and it will be a really nice race. The Jeep is a really nice build
The OPM clip of Sonic getting punched in the balls got my thumb up
Lots of variation in those two cars LOL
Where's my money 🤣🤣 threatening his life this whole episode💀💀💀💀
No dounuts 😭
I wanna see this jeep against that trackhawck that raced Travis .
Sand bagger lol
Day #69 of screaming BRING BACK DANGER DAN
Rich kid in a Lambo... Meh.
What professional video production company uploads their content in 1080p?
Best versus yet 👏 👏👏
Choi is such an insufferable Douchebag, it saddens me to see you're giving him another opportunity
🔥🔥
That lambo on lower boost and without the all wheel drive is already so OP… what would it do all in 😮
Finally A Really Good Race Thanks Fellas Bring Back The Honnicorn
When was this filmed  they dressed like it's cold outside.
🔥🔥🔥
What happened to hoonicorn vs the world
Everyone was bettin on the Jeep I was like "y'all trippin"
13:16 uptop/finishline guy definitely needa get fired 😂 hurracan won by half car if not more last race & the 2nd race hurracan beat the jeep by a few cars so the jeep should have got atleast a car hit lol
No doughnuts by choi???
Sure Alex went stage 3 on the last one 😅 good race tho. Jeep sprays out the hole but needs a scramble
Sheepy Race All Day!! & Choi
Hert and Gary need their own series… just saying…🔥🔥🔥
Jr fab has good fab work as well
Let them out with the new one
He want to rerun you @freddylsx
I wanna see alex's lambo vs honnicorn!
All My Fast Cars Live in Texas.  -George Strait
There was no jump there! His finger moved, the jeep moved. Unfair call on a flat reaction time imo
Beautiful race !!!!!!!
Maaaaan, that jeep can boogie!
All respect to both drivers but this episode is like a built vs bought race
How you miss shift with paddle shifters.🤣😂
umm does my eyes decieve me or is there literally 2 hertz?!?!does he have a twin brother?
How is Alex's car STILL Aliveeee?!!!
What about tri vesta?
Alex🔥
The jeep didn't jump whatttt
I like the hacked Lambo better than the Yuppi status symbol.
I feel cheated no donuts
Dem Texas Boys💯🔥✔
Great race!
Where’s the the fn donuts u guys
that ain't a jump chief...
am i the only person who hates alex he a fkking moron he never builds his own shit ITS SAD
What a great video to wake up to
@8:41 Alex Choi being absolutely DISRESPECTED by the Hoonigan crew!? We needed a Rodney Dangerfield jawn up there for team Lambo... "I get no RESPECT!!?"
The Jeep did not jump as soon as your hand twitch to go down he stepped on the gas which is legal
Finally good close races
We Are Building A New Set Up For The Jeep Hopefully We Can Get A Rematch 🤷🏻‍♂️
This dude that owns the lambo is so stupid and arrogant… He has done nothing in his life apart spending its parents money… And what a terrible driver… Pure idiot
Corey is very extra
Jr fab 👍🏻nice job competing with a Lamborghini
Can’t wait for y’all’s next race episode
is this a reupload tho?
Lamborghini sandbagging lol.  Definitely turned it up after the first race.  Made zero sense to give it the hit the 2nd race.  And horrible arm drop last race, doesn't even give them time to stage properly.  Not a bad race overall though.
🔥🔥🔥🚙💨
Unpopular opinion?? "A chase is a race" is a terrible rule, practically made to be taken advantage of. It almost always gets someone who jumps 50% of the way to an overall win. It's natural to quickly react when your opponent jumps.  So much so, that I've seen exactly ONE time when a jump was not chased on this show, vs plenty of jumps. Kills the fairness in my opinion, and rewards bad performance, or even shady drivers.
man that lambo is going through it lol
Shout out to Alex must be nice not having to actually work and have your parents pay for everything lmao 😫
Somebody know what’s the beat called in the beginning.
Now we need that guy with his tt Silverado and Choi
I did not expect Alex to hook up as well as he did.. nice race though
9:25 I cracked up at work bro cudo to you Editor!
I love how someone drove a Jeep and was like...yeah...yeah...I wanna go fast in this...
Lambo win like 8 cars The end guy: 2 car
lol rwd lambo. good ole reliable
Alec has never turned a wrench in his life
what a surprise !, que lambo, more power, less weight, and more aerodynamic , id, be shocked if didnt won
No doughnuts wtf?
That second race, Alex won by more than 2 cars, for sure lol. That damn Lambo is unreal… imagine if the lambo wasn’t handicapped and been all wheel drive …sheesh.
that was a good race!
Last few choices have been crappy to say the least. The TTRs vs the Supra, now this. DDE's TT lambo would have been a better choice against Choi.
Keep zac working with ken and off this team, him screaming about some engines is probably what killed gymkhana production. NO IT NEEDS A V8, ROOKIE, DONT YOU KNOW?!?!?!
Gary cracks me the hell up!
That rap or paint on that Lamborghini has to go. That was like popular in the 90's. Other then that, cool car.
That's a good race right there
What , No burnouts and donuts ..........Weaksauce......😁
Put 1400hp in the jeep it would have won
That first round jump was nasty. Congrats on being considered a actual drag racer, because the anticipation was incredible to still be able to hold that monster back!
👍👍 Alex Choi! Choi’s hurricane vs DDE’s wannabe maclaren GTR would be a great race #FKDDE
damn. wish built won. vs bought
Alex Choi for damn sure hit that more HP button, props to both for some bad ass cars!
that jeep had more than 1300hp :)) a 1000 my ass
Ugh, not Alex again…🙄
NOW THAT'S A RACE🔥🔥🔥
Puro team “THAT” aka puro Project Torque💯
Don’t feel like he jumped in the first one, looks close enough to call it clean
One of the BEST match up races ever on the show! 2 great cars and that Jeep can get out of the hole, but that reel in by the Lamborghini. 👌
alex hasn't 1200 hp
Dope Episode, Congrats to Alex!!!
gotdamn that jeep knows how to drag but i was rootin for choi. also still not sure about “2 cars” on the second race lmao
Sya penonton indonesia sangat suka sekali dengan chanel chanel ini 👍🇮🇩🇮🇩
Damn the entire internet and now all of hoonigan showed that alex choi has shit taste in cars
I want these guys to split into two teams  and each build a movie car to race head to head.
Sya penonton indonesia sangat suka sekali dengan chanel chanel ini 👍🇮🇩🇮🇩
That lustrous lambo flutter 😬
your best video yet
DAMN  that was a good race!!
No faith in Alex lol 😂
Alex didn’t do donuts in the lambo at the end :(
Thank god hurt and Zac are back in this vs that...it's not the same without them....the other guys just aren't as good....it's been boring
hert got a brother?
Good race by the way 🤜👍
This was the best race in a while 🔥
bruh, the man who does things to cars that shouldn't be done and, no donuts at the end? What is this!
JR FAB jeepeta ⚡️⚡️🏁🏁
Dude, when I heard 2 cars, I was excited to hear Alex raise the flag, because that was like 20 cars, Jeep let out, lol
God Daum I miss Hert
editor deserves a raise
Alex was asleep that doesn't mean the jeep jumped the start
Not racist by any means… but only Mex put off brand labels on their cars.  I’m half surprised there isn’t SS on the front fenders! :) much love tho!  Sick azz jeep!!
Jeep definitely didn't jump on the first race
Include more bikes please
Hawt Dawg!
Jeep definitely didn't jump 1st round. Eatch in slomo. Jeep moves right after the hand drops. Lamborghini waits a full second to move.
I pick lambo for the record and where the roll race?
Lambo won over a pickup. Omezinig
Love how no one bet on him lol
#ECREW ❣️
alix bring the m2
Quite surprised how well the Huracan got the power down. Insane
I don't think the jeep jumped.
"The 3 Vest-igos"
Money vs Skill and passion
2wd lambo? 11:03 you cansee the fronts spin slightly. Full of sh1t.
That was a good race
Alex Choi is a cocky MF. His lambo is fast tho I’m not gonna lie.
That was a good race wow
The Right Way To Start A Monday ✌🏼
Nobody picked the lambo?????? Blasphemous
Let see how bad this match up is this time....
Alex Choad gives all car guys a bad name
Love when the cars are matched.  NOT A  PAINT DRYING RACE.  LOL
I called Lambo by half a car length before I started the video. All I guys guessed jeep. Come on he's running a 1200 hp Lambo . Against a 1000hp brick.
need @1stockgang next
You should put a tiny little mirror that mounts above the phone charging spot, add magsafe if it's not there already, and then people can get video from putting their phone in that front spot as a memento
No jump!!! Perfect reaction time!!!
Let’s Goo !! Bean power ! 💪✊🇲🇽
Jeep, it's anti-Youtuber. Plus all he had to do is turn a dial to go from 1,000 to 1,700 and walk the Jeep. He wasn't running 1700 in the first two races.
the editors killed it this episode 😂😂 felt like I spent more time laughing than watching
Epic race!
That dude starting the race needs to get his timing figured out.  The first 2 races were trash thanks to him.
"This is my twin turbo jip"
The trivestas!!
8:42, It was at this moment that they knew they fucked up.
Puro jr fab alv
😎🤙🏾🤙🏾
This was a good race
Jr fab 🔥🔥
Alex Choi vs hoonicorn please
the person at the end really needs to get fired, the man said by a nose but it was a hole car
Ayy
Lamborghini turned it up and played him
That jump by the Jeep though 🌚  But that Huracan is also craaaaaaazy fast
now THAT was a race!!!
this is BS, wtf was that second race???? it was clear the hit was too much...
Congratulations on 5 million subs guys!
The twin Turbo Yeep!!
Hemi👎👎👎👎
Great race That huracan is insane
I’m here baby! 🍿🍿🍿
Dude, the attention to detail that the editors have. Too good. 3:27
Not denying the Jeep it's power but y'all crazy to think that rear wheel drive heavy ass SUV would take an all wheel drive Lamborghini with more power.
NO ONE PREDICTED LAMBO BUT LAMBO 💥
1700 hp to the wheels, beautiful wrap, twin turbos, awd… “Eh my favorite part is the phone charger”
These match ups lately. Go to valley racing to see how it’s done.
Sheeesh
Big chief needs to make a appearance
