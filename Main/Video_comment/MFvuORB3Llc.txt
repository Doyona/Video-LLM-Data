nice
Having Chubb on the cart as a highlight is kinda of disgusting
mmmmaahhhnnn this game was insane 😂😂😂
5:06 has to be my favorite broadcast call of the season for the steelers, so electric
Man 2024 going into the next szn this was rough proud of the dawgs 2024 we hungry go browns
0:06 0:08 PICKED OFF 0:09 0:12 TD
Loudest crowd cheer I heard in a long time 0:06
When your qb opens with a pick six it ain’t a good sign
0
Watching kenny Pickett is miserable
This was interesting...............
That rule where the ball was fumbled at the goal line and recovered in the end zone by the fumbling team and you spot it back where it was fumbled but if it rolled out of bounce would have been a touchback? Make that make sense
Prays for Nick Chubb and also the Browns and the Steelers is the #1 rivalries in NFL history
Isaiah 46:9 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me,
Didn't even realize Garrett played in this game until it showed him walking on the field at the end. That's your DPOY 😅
Watson had some good moments. However for the most part he looked uncomfortable and panicking the second it wasn't going his way. Also looks slower than he did 3 years ago
💛🖤🏈🌏🙏😎
I'm here in March 2024 just bored and running through the Browns' season highlights and....yeah, I won't watch this game because of Chubb's injury.  I respect both his ability and his mentality so much can't even get close to seeing it.  Love how when the NFL mic'd him up for a game all of his teammates said things like, "You're going to get breathing, grunting, and being tackled"....and that's exactly what they got lol.  If anyone can and deserves to be able to come back, it's Nick Chubb.
Rudolph should be #1 QB. Kick Canada to the curb & get a REAL Offensive Coordinator.
underrated game but feel bad for chubb tho hope he recovers quickly
Scored on the first play 💀
Wow great game by both teams
Hi
Watson isn`t no Lamarr Jackson although he thinks he is.
It’s insane how many ads there are to watch a highlight video
who was that in Cleveland that wished that the Steelers players would get hurt: be careful to whom you wish to~~~ how many brown stains got hurt this past weekend?( no more first overall pick for you guys)

Go Browns
I had to rewatch this cause Im just hoping we come ready to rock and roll this Sunday
browns played great doe
I dont know what to say, I was angry at the injustices and wrongs towards me, so painful. I was about to confront the situations,  but thanks be to Adonai Tzavot, God if heavens armies, I will be still and let the Lord fight my battles.
Steelers win
Hurst had the best celebration ever at 9:09
This was my first game at Heinz Field
As a browns fan this game was tough to watch
At 1015 the refs should of saw 29 getting face masked by 19
I am neighbors with the RB of the Steelers Jalen Warren
Browns are in for a hurting against the Niners.
Such a dumb sport hahahah
This is living proof that the NFL hates the Cleveland Browns.
When they all lost the ball was funny 😂
If the Browns just put away games they have won, they be a contender.
That was a violent game. Very physical with a lot of helmet to helmet hits
Browns are finished. Chubs is gone and the o line can't give Watson time
L
Cant believe how boring this Steelers team is. Total no name team
IDC WHO? SAYS BROWNS ARE NO GOOD WE ARE AWSOME AND WE WILL GO to the Top and WIN!!!
George Pickens 10 targets 4 receptions 127 receiving yards 1 receiving touchdown 18.7 Fantasy Points!
show the hit you cowards
I watched every browns Steelers game since 1975 when in Pittsburg the Steelers always seem to find a way to beat us.get well #24
Browns defensive performance wasted by deshaun watson's blunders! Steelers may have won but their offense is very anemic at best lol.
You know how many times i seen Pittsburgh hit somebody as soon as they got the ball and we would get it but they'd rule it not a catch..
13:27 Cleveland Browns player pushes over the Gatorade for no reason
The trials and tribulations of Pat Freiermuth
steelers punter was perfect and defense came and played way better than the browns defense did. boring offensive game tho
Honestly I’m not a fan of the defenseless receiver rule, but if they’re going to call it they prob should have called that hit on Olszewski, he’s still out with a concussion.
It's called Turnpike Rivalry for a reason.
Myles Garrett ready to dip lol  🚪🏃🏿‍♂️💨
even tho I’m a browns fan and horrible nick got taken out like that still an entertaining game yeah we lost but these guys risk their bodies every game each week for every fans watching at home or in the stands sure they got millions of dollars but the injuries is apart of the game all I gotta say is browns or Steelers take the afc tired of watching the ravens take it almost every year
Steelers QB & offense need a lot of work.
Njoku makes Ozzie look like a high school player¡!!!!??
Elijah Riley with the killer instinct on the sack come onnnnnnnn
As a Steelers fan, I think they play inconsistently. They may be 'hot' for a moment, Then, on the next play, they can be cold.
Looked like a hold at the end
Being a Steelers fan under mike tomlin he has truly been a defensive coordinator it’s always been relied on Steelers defense to make or break wins in the season
Pittsburgh QB did not have any of his receivers best interest at heart…he was leading his receivers into Hitsticks
PGH STEELER fanatics remember PGH opponents R not putting points on scoreboard because.of main reasoning play faults of QB KP8 and/or OC Canada...
This Defense scored more than the Offense...
Any browns here? What is happening to Deshaun Watson? Please give me some insight ? He looks slow mentally and physically
Really hard to watch these qb's..
Who the hell is #73 - Not doing his job - standing there blocking NO ONE as his QB gets sacks, again! (11:53 in the 4th quarter)
#firecanada
13:59 Unspectacular play to watch twice in a row ahahaha
6:23 That play reminded me of what Gronk used to do!
Jermaine Ford taking advantage of the opportunity. Glad to see him getting reps!
#77 @ 11:45 LMAOOOOO
The Steelers become the first team since the Rams in the 2021 NFC Wild Card to win a game one week after playing the San Francisco 49ers.
sloppyyyyy
Deshaun watson is trash. Lmfao
praying for chubb
Hope Chubb is ok
great to see watson lose
Всегда поддерживаю Steelers! И мне часто хочется пожалеть Browns, их часто преследует невезение.  Steelers победили исключительно усилиями персонала защиты! Это фантастика! Персонал защиты сделал TD больше, чем персонал атаки - 2 vs 1. Невероятно! Атака Steelers играла ужасно. Мне хочется верить в талант и способности Pickett (QB), но в этой игре он проявил себя плохо - не находил эффективные решения под давлением, был не точен. Надеюсь, Steelers смогут наладить игру в атаке.  Browns имели немало возможностей убить интригу в матче, но пара INT с возвратом в EZ перечеркнули эффективность персонала защиты Browns и меткость бьющего
Most calls always go Pittsburgh's way when they play at home.  Statistics show the Steelers really do have home field advantage every time they play in Pittsburgh (the refs must love them).  I also know they hate the Browns because of the beer bottle incident.  The worst one was the no-call on the blatant push by the defense on the receiver that should have been pass interference on the Browns last drive.  Still not quite as bad as #49 Sorenson for the Chiefs in the AFC championship charging head first down the goal line and they say the NFL is concerned about concussions.  The only thing they're worried about is the Chiefs and the Steelers winning because of lousy (cheating refs) cheap shots and non-calls.
GO STEELERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
therez 15 minutes I'll never get back
I could see Matt Canada playing NFL Madden with the Steelers, 2 runs up the middle for 1st and 2nd down, 3rd and 12 or 7 and then go for a lil outside slant pass for the fail everytime. Matt Canada - "why am i losing, im using the most basic old school play tactics everytime!!!" Come on gm give us steelers fans a break and fire matt canada, that way we can get on with are daily lives, and make awesome winning and interesting plays (against good Ds) that our players deserve... I digress, ill take a d when though. Thank you d coord.
that last play was NOT PI at all, that ball was way out of bounds. Clearly uncatchable.
Di fronte a bruttissimi infortuni come quello di Nick Chubb non esistono colori o rivalità... Tanti auguri di pronta guarigione!
Browns defense is good. But to win a game, they will have to be perfect. Officials will not call any fouls against Watson lol it’s just how it is haha. So Browns defense, #2 in the league, will have to really bully offended. Only way. Here for it.
Uh oh.   Well, as in every beginning of the season for the Cleveland Browns, as soon as only one game is won they are heading to the Super Bowl, as always presented on the wonderful Cleveland area news. So the biggest question now for the Cleveland Browns are they still going to be in the Super Bowl this year and of course, are they going to win just as in the previous year’s?? Perhaps instead of always boasting from the coaching, staff and news, a little humility, and then win the Super Bowl and then you can boast but that’s why I’m no longer a Cleveland Browns fan
No doubt this is highlights put out by the Shield. Zero coverage of Watson's 2 face mask holds or his sideline reactions and shove of an official. The NFL likes to control what we see.
Laying to Duck
Deshawn Watson grabbing opposing teams facemasks without consent. Wow I guess he really is a violent individual.
The Laving to run
Ya gotta feel bad for Cleveland fans, somebody within their organization always finds a way to screw their team.
Steeler Fan sending many prayers for Chubb and his family❤
Watson did not look that bad in this game. He lost it in the end but he still looks good.
Man that play JPJ made on 3&8 was 🔥 we haven’t had that in awhile
Intense rivalry passionate play
As a Steelers fan. All I got to say. Go Black and yellow.  And for Cleveland browns player that got hurt. My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. Both teams played a good game and offense and defense.
It sucks that Nick Chubb is out from the game. Hope he's feeling well and better again!
Pittsburgh cheated they okayed dirty let’s hear it lol
Bro Chubb is the hardest working football player he deserves better
How the hell can you watch any football game with non stop commercials??? I stopped watching football  games just because of all these suckers, money making hyenas.
Honestly after chubbs injury and everything that had happened up to that point i just wanted the game to end. Pretty miserable night for both teams
Broo was that one of the fastest   TDS ever or na? 😧
When taki taki got the sack his teammate was happy for him. That's wassup!!!
Anyone else notice how soft and slow the snaps are from center??? They're floating to Pickett
It's easy to see that Pittsburgh LITERALLY LET CLEVELAND have that touchdown drive after Mr. Chubb went down.  They GIFTED the BROWNS that touchdown probably courtesy of MIKE TOMLIN himself!  Call me crazy, however, that was EXACTLY what I saw. Browns still lost...
At 3:06  It was targeting   You can’t shove your helmet into someone’s chest   Poor sportsmanship ; I can’t believe the reds didn’t see that
Y'ALL GOTTA STUDY... STOP THINKING THAT BECAUSE IT'S WEEK 2 ORGANIZATIONS AND TEAMS ARE GOING TO GIVE ANYTHING TO YOU EASY... JUST BECAUSE THEY SUCK DON'T MEAN THEY WONT COME OUT TO PLAY THE GAME.
11:35
LOS ROONEY DEVERIAN VENDER ALOS STEELERS AUNA FAMILIA MODERNA DE ESTOS TIEMPOS....PORQUE NO VAN A DESPEDIR A MIKE TOMLIN Y A CANADA....
$200 million guaranteed You gotta come and play dudes wanna get paid on the other team. Kenny Pickett is broke He's gonna sick His wolves on D. Watson. Come prepared to play the game. Stop giving up one strike easy plays.
Deshaun Watsons first fumble was such fraud. I’m sick of the BS fraud calls this browns team gets and doesn’t get
As a nephew of nich
FIRE CANADA !!!
Browns o-line is trash
can't wait to score 10 offensive points against a shitty raiders defense on Sunday Night Football
offense & defense makes every 32 nfl teams complete rather they good on defense or offense or both for a team like the steelers on offense they are still figuring things out don't forget almost everyone they added is new to the squad and probably still learning the system thats for both sides of the ball give it time to come together they are still one of the best teams to me they gotta find they mojo tho and yeah #MattCanada gotta go!!
What the F are these guy done in the white head gear. I done with Cleveland sports. DONE!
MATT CANADA  HAS NO IMAGINATION, ARE KENNY PICKETT IS HAVEING TROUBLE READING DEFENCES,WE HAVE WORK TO TO DO FROM TOP TO BOTTOM,.
Man I e heard the media dog Watson and Pickett for 2 days, and some of it is deserved. But it’s kinda hard to throw when they are camped out in your backfield all day. 2 good front 4 defenses.
Whew, I really feel bad for Chubb 😢
Great win Steelers 🖤💛🖤💛
at least Baker is doing fine in Tampa
Was the football covered in butter 😂
watson thinks he so good for making a 2 point lol
Like the browns uniforms
i cringe every time someones holds the ball out one handed in front of them whilst running before they get into the end zone. i picture it slipping.
Good game ❤bill's  bound
Those browns uniforms lowkey look like the syracuse uniforms
Fire Matt Canada, Prayers for Nick Chubb. If Matt Canada was doing his job the Steelers defense wouldn’t have been that aggressive.   It’s Matt Canada fault for making the defense frustrated.
He should average at least 8 touches a game, still not getting him the ball enough
go steelers from eagles fan 👍
as you watch the highlights, PFF gave Myles Smollett Garrett a high grade than TJ Watt...tell me which one does more for their team and which one disappears
This could’ve been a great game but they messed it up by doing way too much extra bs! Unfortunate cuz both sides for both teams were pathetic
Get rid of Matt canada
Browns lineman are not blocking to the whistle blows. Got to fix that now!! Can't allow pocket to collapse like that around Dashaun. When pocket is collapsing, they stop blocking. til the whistle blows! til the whistle blows! til the whistle blows! Every player plays til the whistle blows!!!!!
I think the defense is ready...
🥰🥰🥰🥰
knew watson would chock. that serial rap est should be out of NFL but it's nice to see him chock like he always does.
Had to come here for truth -PIT Steelers "official highlight video" avoided making KP8 look as terrible as he was.
Bro last play dats passing interference cmon man
At 4:56 someone explain why this #23 guy is a CB in the NFL?
Is the NFL hiring bot farms to comment on their videos to help with their algorithm?  I don't really ever see the same kind of bots in other comment sections on YouTube.
Second half I wasn’t able to watch. Thanks for posting.
Horrible offensive scheme by the browns offensive coordinator. They were playing Moore on the outside and Watson was just throwing balls towards the sideline. That is horrible play design by the offensive coordinator. Elijah Moore is a slot receiver that needs to run routes in between the numbers. Look at Puka Nacua, he runs underneath in man and comebacks in zone . Its simple !!!!!
Why wasnt Elijah Moore in on that first interception . They had randoms playing receiver on that play and look at that result 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. Browns offensive coordinator needs to get fired immediately
Watson needs to play a whole lot better!
TJ Watt is a monster!!
Knew Steelers would win lol 😂
Fire Matt Canada and Gunner. Sign Steven Sims for WR help. Promote JPJ, Desmond King, and Warren
To be honest, the Steelers wouldn't have won this game if the refs had make that call for pass interference in the last minutes.
Sweden's Sport NFL a good game in Old Continent Origin...This Sport begun in Sweden and did pass through To America...
Lional messi dribbling >>>> all of these combined
BROWNS WON!!!
I'm trying to see how everybody is blaming Watson for this loss? It was just a flat out sloppy game I blame the coaches for that.
Athletically Watson is a shell of what he use to be. No longer the dynamic duel threat weapon he was in Houston. He looks slow now. Basically a dropback passer
The browns didnt look to bad the offensive lineman could have protected deshaun a lot better the defense could have done a lot better and deshaun running game dont look as fast as he normally do and he could have made a lil bit better choice throwing the ball to the recievers that were closer rather throwing hell marries that had to much coverage but overall they look good this year im happy for him!!!
I would love it if you could take a few minutes to read the post and let me know what you think. You can leave a comment on the blog post, or you can email me directly.  Thanks   https://aati1976.blogspot.com/2023/09/the-nfls-overtime-revolution-what-you.html
Minkah faking his injury knowing he destroyed chubbs knee
Deshaun beat the cases for that performance 🤦‍♂️ 😂
Say what you want about Nick Chubb, but Deshaun Watson IS Tiger Woods
That’s what’s you get for leaving the Texans Deshaun
tf mickey mouse
Man, DeShaun Watson sucks😂....230mil and 3 first round picks?? Insanely bad investment and now the Browns are stuck with him....yes, the Browns are the Browns! 😂
Browns should have won this game. The Steelers looked awful. Bad QB and terrible offense.
who tf signed off on that 230 mil contract for a mediocre QB?  The Browns never miss the opportunity to fu.
They bogus for missing that obvious pass interference on Cleveland last play smh
this may be the only win Pitts. Steelers have this season !
Please new OC, please
🔥🔥🔥🔥🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦  Byron Leftwich For OC
Amare Cooper MVP
Both teams have young talent they could be really good.
This looked like amateur night or a college game, not sure...
Is it just me or do most QBs in the NFL appear to be overly hurried on account of them being extremely nervous that they will be squashed like a bug?
Nah, that last play they showed was defensive interference.
Incredibly unserious game
The amount is of bots in the comments here is outrageous.
Matt Cananda???why
Man the Browns literally gave the Squealers this win. All the turnovers, terrible kick return play that backed them into the end zone and stupid penalties. Their offense looked quite a bit better than Pukesburgh, even tho they played terrible this game. That’s saying something. Squealers got a good defense, but that’s about it.
NFL, thank you for not showing the Nick Chubb injury. I appreciate that. Just seeing him on the cart was enough. Great job being sensitive to that situation.
Najee Harris suck 😂
levi wallace is hot garbage
First play set the tone for the rest of the game 🫡
It'd be a great story if Kenny Pickett went from Pitt star to Steeler star.  If he can become a Derek Carr level QB it will be a major achievement.  Watson has become another Kapernick.  Outstanding athlete, but inaccurate.  We know why Kap's out of the league, but was on his way to being a backup.  Watson has lost it.
Cleveland lost that game because of those stupid ugly helmets 🤦🏻‍♂️ I’m not a Browns fan, but those OG helmets are one of my favorites in the entire NFL!!! Stick with the Original Orange dog!!
That's one oily pigskin!
The Steelers got lucky. There offense play like trash, but there defense was the thing that got it done. I still think the Steelers are coming in last place of there division. You can’t have a good defense and a Trash offense. There are others teams they have yet to face the have a tough offense and defense. That game changes nothing. The Steelers will come in last place of there division.
Bengals gonna roast both of youz🤣🤣🤣
If any player on Browns that should of go hurt number 4 should of I been a Cleveland Browns fan For over 30 years  and Number 4 should not be playing in the NFL.
That some weird helmets is that new!
Steeler defense is great and all but if the offense can't score  the defense is just going to get tired just saying
Go to about 11:05 and listen to what Joe Buck said 😆
Good job Ford for holding it down, I have full faith in him.  And I'm not religious, but I'll pray for everyone that is for Chubb. He has an amazing career to continue if he recovers well.
Alternate Title: The Cleveland Browns lose Nick Chubb and Forfeit Their Whole Season 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
SO SAD FOR NICK CHUBB 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 He didn't deserve that, no one deserves that but especially not Nick Chubb and the Browns :( . I hope that doesn't end his career.
Steelers are a dirty team and should be ashamed of what happened to Nick Chubb
Pickett isn’t very good.
For all those saying it was a dirty hit, as a Browns fan it was not. Players are taught to aim low to tackle big rbs like Chubb. This time it was just so unfortunate luck
I think it's a win brown stain
So sad to know about Nick Chubb's injury. Let's hope and pray he gets well soon.   Chubb is one of the best RBs in the game! Hope he gets back stronger!
So glad we won so Myles Garrett can eat his words! 😅
🔥🇨🇦
Tomlin is about to have his first losing season and be unemployed come february.
I been a Steelers fans since the 70's
Kenny P is kind of tarded
Watson step your game up you got a good team an you lost cause of mistakes you need to tighten up y'all gonna be last in the AFC North🎉
Wallace and Peterson are liabilities big time.
Steelers should get Jamis Winston
TJ Watt is the Man.
Steelers fan..praying for nick and his family
Unwatchable because of ads
@3:00 that little white guy getting hit reminds me of "The Warerboy".
I like the all white jerseys and helmets
QB- all ladies ,ready?🤣😂🤣😂
11:45 teller change teams mid Game 😭😭😭
Artificial turf should be banned and protested
Steelers yall are sorry as hell this year lmao..Ravens run the North again like it has always been
Kaka browns
Deshaun Watson was the Steelers' leading scorer!
There were like 20 fumbles 🤣
It's the type of game that make you think the NFL is rigged
I can not remember a game with this many fumbles
This was the worst football game I've ever watched.  Both teams played horrible.  Even the camera had a split screen for several minutes.  Uhhh....!
😂😂😂 first play
Again…they released Deshaun why?? Then again, probably did him a favor….I never cared for Browns
🖤💛🏈💪🏻😤🔥
This game was a war! Not always super well played I guess but it was entertaining!
Watson is washed 🗑️
We have mad explosive talent on defense, but it won't carry us the whole season. Mike Tomlin and the Steelers organization needs to listen to the fans chanting. Fire Matt Canada an bench KP
Matt Canada sucks!
Been saying. Watt and highsmith are gonna break mad records an be the best duo in the league
11:38-11:48 didn't see that live but that was very heartwarming to see! Just enjoying the game✊️👏
Everyone hyped up the KP pick. But beings 31 other team passed him up. An a few of them in need of a QB should have said all that needed to be said. An now we have all our hopes riding on a guy that can't get nothing going
I'm very thankful we have the best defense. But our offense needs some changes. If our next game is this bad, Matt needs fired an Pickett needs benched
If the steelers were smart they'd fire Canada and bring in a college coach that had an exciting offense because the steelers have the players to be an electric offense but are being held back by the OC..
The steelers desperately need some legit X's & 0's guys, like, for a decade plus now...
Browns was disappointing
I don’t follow Nfl so i do not know about injuries in this sport but after i’ve seen the replay there is no way that kid is playing ever again
PICKENS WAS PICKIN BABY ❤❤❤
Game rigged no way anyone should have gotten away with pulling a jersey.
The olive oil shortage making headlines news today.......why, because so much of it was used on the football in this game.
Pickens got jets 😂
8 out of 10 pittsburgh tackles are absolutely horrible to watch!!!
Not sure if Matt Canada is this bad or maybe Najee and Kenny are no good.
#4 sucks
On the sack fumble for td Jed Wills gets smoked and gives up. Just stands there and watches it all happen. Never gives full effort and it shows. Pathetic.
11:25.. elbow is DOWN.. ☝️
Both Teams are Garbage .  This Game was Rigged for the Steelers 100%  Obvious . Freemason Orchestrated Deception . haha
Watson isn’t near the same he was in Houston. Browns overpaid but we all knew that
I HAVENT SEEN TEL A LIE IN YEARS OR SPORTS......NOT WORTH WATCHING,,,,,,DONT MIS IT AT ALL
Pickett suck, Harris suck, and OC Canada suck 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
Dirty bum Fitzpatrick knew he gets sonned by Chubb on the regular so he had to end his career
I'm a STEELERS fan, but seeing NICK CHUBB go out like that is very horrendous and gruesome. I hate seeing those types of injuries occur. I pray that he recovers fully from that terrible injury.
I can't tell if Najee is washed or.our O Line needs to improve 🤔
Watson is hot garbage now man. It’s insane that he was top 3 few years ago
Oh yeah the titans gonna beat the browns for sure 💀
TOMLIN HAS GOT YO GO HE IS TOTALLY OVERRATED ,BUT IN REALITY HE IS THE WORSE COACH IN THE NFL IF HE WAS WHITE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN FIRED YRS AGO
49ers fan here, the Steelers has a great defense. They need to work on their offense though.
Trade Pickettt now
Why cut off the play and give us the ref's call on the fumble?
Gotta love it when your team's O scores 22, your D holds the opponent's O to 12, and you lose by 4.
i feel sorry about the Chubb injury but i must say that those white hats werent all that. The suits are just ugly. I think that the all brown with the orange lettering was the best. Even a brown helmet wouldve been fire
All Steelers points   Offense:6 Defense:12 Special teams:9     HOW THE DOES THE DEFENSE AND SPECIAL TEAMS SCORE MORE POINTS THAN THE OFFENSE!?!?!?
Massage Watson looking like he is worth every penny of his historically inflated contract.....NOT.
Terrible video editing.  Please do better.  Mistakes are understandable.  Mistakes on every single video?  Much less so.
Steelers played dirty af, that hit on Chubb was intentional.
Was there grease on the football? I lost track of the fumbles.
What was this reverse deflate gate
Where the Cubb hit
Please pray for Nick 🙏
Our offense is terrible. It's pretty bad when the defense scores more TDs than the offense. Canada should've been gone a year ago
13:28 I know he didn't
"Lets go into the shotgun formation on 3rd & 1" Get Canada TF out of there already, he's TERRIBLE.  Absolutely terrible play calling once again. Those were one of the worst plays I've ever seen being called and I've been watching football for over 30 years now. The defense won this game
Cleveburg! Chubb out. Two turnovers for TDs? Why do you break our hearts so?
Not going to say with which team I have fealty, It was an embarrassing game for both.
Kareem Hunt sure deserves some respect now, huh?
11:40 idk but that exchange between 77 and the steeler doing the dance was funny 😂😂😂
A lot of coping conspiracists, spray the copium into a bag before huffing it, does less damage to the lungs and brain, might be too late for that though.
Sorry but the Browns got robbed on that last play. It was DEFINITELY PASS INTERFERENCE.   SHAMEFUL.
Browns need a better offensive coordinator
Announcers were hyping Pittburgh defense a lot. Steelers have bottom 5 defense at best without ref bribery. Nor even close
Steelers fan here and losing Chubb means less great football to watch. Prayers up to an early goat! 🙏🏽
i coudnt take my eyes off this game. usually on my phone but this game had me locked in!
The steelers had to injure half of the browns starters to win this gane smh
For first touch down. Looks like he stepped out of bounds... Hard to tell from this video... Like another opinion See if my eyes are correct
Great highlights package!!!
when you give up 14 points on offense, its hard to win.The more I see of Watson, the more it reminds me of wilson only more expensive. Steelers offense is still anemic and will struggle to get a wild card.
First time in 24 seasons that I'm done watching Browns football by week 2. I'm washing my hands with them until stefanski is fired. Iegit can't put up with this shlt anymore.
watson is sooo slow
Steelers would've scored 50 but their best QB is getting paid 10 million to hold a clipboard haga
Ugly win but we got it. Love our defense!! Offense just needs to figure it out and we’d be a real deal problem
Chubb’s injury was tragic but that isn’t why they lost. The O-line has issues and either Watson has regressed to the point of looking like a second rate backup or the  Stefanski-Watson experiment has failed completely.
That beautifully covered ball by porter totally reminded me of Petey on that remember the Titans play😂
I really hope Chubb didn’t suffer a career-ending injury
I love my Steelers❤. But this game was hard to watch.  I thought at one point I was watching an high school game.  Steelers defense though, looks good.  Steelers got to do better😢.
I can’t believe nick chubb broke his leg in week 2 only week 2
man I feel like since the Browns qb situation hasn't been stable that people forget how much of a dawg Cooper is. Sheesh.
Also, my prayers go out to Chubb with the hope that he will continue playing for the Browns or any NFL team in the future.  That helmet to the knee damaged all the ligaments, as I understand it.  How terrible.  Please come back soon.  Go Browns!!!
Deshaun watson sucks. He was just throwing balls and hoping for the best. Steelers defence kept the game close and saved kenny picketts bacon because he sucks too.
Without Nick Chubb as the center of the Browns offensive attack, you wonder if Jerome Ford, as good a runner as he is, can take up the slack.  Only time will tell.  Also, can Browns O-line persevere without Conlin. Dewand Jones to me seemed average.  At times he protected Deshaun Watson well, but, also, he made some mistakes, like a holding penalty, and not keeping the Steelers at bay on pass rushes, leading to sacks of Watson.  The coming weeks will also unveil something about him.  But I'm so sick of what I saw last night.  The defense played hard, but some of them came up lame with injuries.  Will see what happens there, as well as how the Brownies do against the Titans next Sunday at home.  Another tough one.
Minus the hideous turnoves that were touchdowns its a browns win
Watson fumble to lose the game. Thank you Football gods! : )
Great defensive game for this long time rivalry! I sincerely hope that Chubbs has the best recovery possible. I also hope that he received some sort of college degree for the future!
Pickens is electric
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wondering how Adam Gerstenhaber is feeling today.....besides overweight!? What an idiot!
Love the all whites cleveland
As a Steelers fan I say that their offense stinks.  This team is the definition of insanity.  Keep doing the same thing over and over but expect different results.  Unbelievable that they still have Matt Canada
That is a scary injury for Chubb I’m sure he will recover he is a good RB, it is a brutal position they get smoked by 300 pound lineman I got run over by a 260 pound fullback in Highschool I walked it off my team was a circus though
Browns got cheated on last play should’ve been a pass interference without doubt
Time..for..Canada… to be FIRED.  Kenny is clearly not comfortable nor on the same page with this offense. It’s time.  Lastly, highsmith is turning out to be a god send. Him and Watt are biblical.
Joe buck and aikman make you wanna mute the tv on Monday football dudes is clearly prejudice to Deshaun Watson
Canada must be out....
As a Ravens fan it sucks to see Chubbs go down like that. It was always awesome to watch him play and now his season is over.   With that said, it was actually fun to watch the Steelers win this one.  From what I saw last week, mostly from people that get paid to cover the Browns, Cleveland was ready to name the Browns the division champs.  So it was nice to see them get knocked down a few pegs.
As a Browns and Baker mayfield fan, this makes me laugh. Also sure baker is getting a good laugh, too
*I wanted to post a comment saying remember what Tomlin said yrs ago to Willie Parker about the Steeler's being in the business to win Super Bowl's NOT rushing titles LOL!!! Someone needs to give Tomlin a piece of his own advice and tell him the Steeler's aren't in the business of having a coach with the best win % without winning SB's PERIOD!!!*
Bruh now running backs wont get paid
Dirty play form Fitzpatrick
SHOULD HAVE FIRED CANADA IMMEDIATELY AT THE END OF LAST SEASON
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼 for chubb
Wow, that was quick, RIP Browns’ season…
Watson is garbage on and off the field
Hated to see what happened to Chubb now what’s going on with the Steelers offense we got to get something figured out or it’s gonna be a long year of our defense saving the team
Najee Harris is a shell of himself from last year.
The second half of this game was insane. A lot of action packed football. STEELERS FTW!!!👺😤
Great job Steelers, from a Chiefs fan 😂
Tomlin won 2 Challenges in ONE game against the Browns after losing ALL of them for the past 4 years?  Yea, the aliens should be arriving soon.
EASY WIN FOR THE BROWNS IF THE STEELERS WEREN'T A DIRTY TEAM
HAD ENOUGH OF THAT STUPID CANADA!!!! IT IS TIME FOR TOMLIN TO TAKE OFF HIS SHADE AND SEE HOW SUCKS CANADA IS!!
Steelers got a gimme game and barely won. The life of browns went down with Chubb. This should’ve been a blowout
FIRE CANADA!! LETS START A PETITION TO FIRE CANADA!! HE IS THE REASON WHY CHUBB WAS HURT!!!
Dis crowd noise ain't electric, it's diesel
Pickets got an arm on him!!! 😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
I felt sorry for Chubb but can't blame minkah for this. This is totally Canada fault!! Steelers offense sucks!! And Chubb and Minkah stuck on the field. Had Minkah not struck by fatigue, he would have prevented this. I had enough of all this nonsense.. let FIRE CANADA !!!!!!!!!!
Steelers beat Browns because Chubb got hurt😂😂😂 They still suck💩
since when did we allow pi
Saw the game, seemed to me the Steeler secondary is doing a lot of "arm tackling" especially #29 Wallace instead of putting a shoulder in there.
I only came to see the injury to Chubb and you robbed me of that.
For a highlight video this sure has a lot of lowlights
*PICKET NEEDS TO SETTLE IN HIS ROLE AS THE STARTING QUARTERBACK, HE EARNED IT LAST YEAR* 😎
I am not interested watching either these teams again. What a sloppy game
TURNOVERS
Also levi wallace was absolutely terrible... its time to give someone else that starting spot
Awesome Steelers win of Butterball the fumbling!!
The NFL is fixed and rigged by the officials to fit narratives the NFL likes. It is entertainment not fair and unbiased officiated to protect the integrity of the game. I'm done.
I’ve played 12 year olds on madden with better play calling than Matt Canada
Watson turned in one of the saddest performances I ever seen.  Apart from a mediocre stat line including a pick and 6 sacks, he lost 2 fumbles (himself) and committed two 15-yard facemask penalties.  Just ugly.
D Watson shoved a ref yet wasn’t immediately tossed from the game ? 🤷‍♀️
What a game
I heard TJ Watt broke James Harrisons sack record? Where are all these sacks? And sad to see a record held by Harrison broken in a game like this but gotta be happy for TJ
This game proved why the Browns get no respect from fans or media. They're done with the "loaded roster" and "potential". Defense is fantastic, but the HC is over his head, and DW is the worst starting qb in football. Not opinion, its a fact. Just when you think they might have it figured out they go out and put on this performance. Nobody will respect them until they string together wins vs top teams, and they can't seem to beat anybody but the Bengals under KS. 6 or 7 win team at best with 4 at qb and KS calling plays. They lost a game to a team that had -7 yards of offense in the 4th quarter, and never had a red zone trip. Let that sink in. The level of bad you have to be for that to happen is unheard of.
I’ve never seen one of these nfl edited highlights show like 15 INCOMPLETIONS for the highlights in 1st half bc there was nothing else 😂😂
This game was a clown show no one could hold on to the ball 😂
This was one of the UGLIEST SLOPPIEST games I’ve seen in some time….
Cleveland QB is stoopid
As great  as  our  Defense  played  the  open  field   tackling  misses  by  multiple  players  in  multiple  scenarios  is a MAJOR  ISSUE  !! ..Stop  those  plays  n  browns  offense  looks  ALOT  Different  !!😎
Amazing officiating again !!! Great game Steelers !!! NOOOOOOOTTTTT
Those white unis are god awful
By the way the officiating was amazing for Pittsburgh again ! Ty so so so much for making betting legal !
What a dirty play against Nick Chubb’s. I guess if that’s what the Steelers have to do to win then they’ll do it
I have a feeling that the NFL somehow is rigged or fixed. Steelers had had the worst GM for the past 20 years, most of his top picks were busts, then this year they get the best gm, the roster is good, but now the offensive coordinator is the worst there is! It doesn't take a genius to see that Matt Canada needed to be let go at the end of last year, but why did they have to let him continue coaching? Something about this makes me doubt the authenticity of these games, things that are Soo obvious are just let to go on. Other teams have similar issues going on so, unless he NFL comes out and explains it logically, I have to conclude that the games are fixed, someone somewhere knows the score before the games are played!
I didn’t realize but the browns TE was grabbed by his WR and let them take it all the way.😂
somebody needs to break #39's legs as payback.
Uhh huh ………."………
Who was on Cooper man😢😅😅
Great game, crazy game but amazing..WATT....WOWZZA
I wonder if the Browns could try and acquire Jonathan Taylor from the Colts to replace Chubb. Not sure they have cap room or would be willing to give the Colts what they want in draft picks/players to get him
WHERES THE EJECTION FOR WATSON FOR PUSHING A REF AND ON THE SECOND FACE MASK PULLING A GUYS HEAD DOWN BY HIS FACE MASK.WHATS HE THE REFS GO TO BOY NOW THAT BRADYS RETIRED?
It's funny towards the end you could clearly see that Watson lost his trust in his O-Line, he couldn't even look at them after the Steelers surrounded him and his line just stood around to see if he could survive. 😂
How many fumbles
Stefanski < Freddie Kitchens. 👍
Sad when the D puts up more points than the offense. Don't have to be Nostrodamus to play against Matt Canada, just need to put bodies on the field.
3:03 absolutely not a fumble, not even close
That Brown's QB head is not in the game... When all is said and done this may be one of the worst trades...
Deshawn "Who" ? That guy is the WORST acquisition for the Browns in their HISTORY ! And they gave up SO MUCH to get him - LOL - WHAT A JOKE !
as a steelers fan, chubb was my favorite non-steelers in the division sad to see him get hurt
OMG the throw Kenny made at the 7:00 min mark . .
2023 Fumble Bowl...
Well, that's two teams that won't be in the playoffs if they don't tighten up those turn overs
Pickett needs to turn it around quickly. The man is so inaccurate it's crazy. Looks like he cant read the defense at all. Not sure how he looked so good this preseason and had a decent end to the year last year just for him to look like this to start the year.
what is this game
Steelers will be eviscerated by the Browns in Cleveland.
It’s crazy to think that the Steelers used a first round pick on Najee Harris.
Whoever was covering DPJ on that last play was hanging on his jersey like a goddamned backpack. It's the Steelers though, so of course they get away with it
Terrible loss for Cleveland fans. Nick Chubb is a great running back. Wish he was on the Steelers. He'll be back for Cleveland. Best wishes for a speedy recovery. Browns will be in the mix in the end this year.
A Divisional Game, Conference Game, At Home. Had To Win This. 0&2? No Way, Then Have To Travel To Las Vegas, To Face The Raiders On Sunday Night? You Gotta Be Kidding Me. Feel Bad For Nick Chubb, Bad Man😊.
I’m soooo glad my Phins stuck with Tua 😂😂😂
Wondering if I’ve ever seen a Steelers game where they didn’t have one trip to the red zone? I’ll take that dub!
FIRE CANADA 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 FIRE CANADA 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Can you imagine going to get a beer and missing this first play😂
And just like that the Browns season is over. Get well soon Nick Chubb. Unfortunate but that's the game of football. Also Watson has the worst contract in the NFL.
I feel bad for Nick Chubb, hopefully he heals soon.
I thought I was watching Auburn Tigers vs Iowa Hawkeyes, by just looking at the uniforms.
THE GREATEST GAME
They need to call Kareem Hunt, I think he would do better than ford.
It's great news Chubb's injury is just a dislocation and is expected back next week.
PRAYERS UP CHUBBS🙏🙏🙏
To all Steeler fan's we are not going to win ever with Matt Canada. When is Steeler management going to accept this. If not for our defense, we would be 0 and 2. And here's some numbers to think about. Last Superbowl win February 2009. Last Superbowl appearance February 2011. Last playoff win 2016.....Steeler Nation this is unacceptable.
Should've kept baker smh
Look what Pickens can do on a bad offensive night. Just wait...
Kenny Pickett and Harris suck period. We will suck until we get Harris and Pickett of the team. Harris runs with no power. Kenny seems to be afraid of everything cant pass worth a darn. Dang
Never thought id be thanking the steelers but THANK YOU! I HIT MY BET BETTING OVER 47.5 AND YOU GOT ME 48. THANKS
Steelers Fan...Shout out to Nick Chubb.   You are respected.
https://youtube.com/watch?v=wV3EvQdObts&si=EWAK5Dp7qxmY0TXQ
I hope the browns lose every game of every season. Glad baker is having success
our secondary doesn't make good decisions... I think its the play calls but still they can't seem to tackle when needed
I’m not saying the hit on Chubb was intentionally meant to injure him, but I will say the league needs to do something to protect these rb.  It should be a suspension of a few games for darting your shoulder or helmet into the running backs knee.  Thigh is fine but directly into the knee should come with a penalty to make players aim for the thigh pad.
Anyone else notice the one play that repeated? 13:54
Minkah Fitzpatrick needs to be hit like Darryl Stingley was hit, with the same outcome! That is how you handle dirty players!
Browns have a horrible group of fans! Here’s my video on why! https://youtu.be/h2kDiHiLA5w?si=rbtyIlViUI5gBuSO
As a Steelers fan everyone pray for chub
The Browns is the Browns
As a Steelers fan, this is pathetic. Our defense scored more points than the offense. Someone needs to step up and fire Matt Canada and coach Pickett. Throwing too many interceptions and a lot of terrible play calling on offensive side
A Steelers team with enough offensive quality to make a deep play off run will be lucky to even make it out of their conference as long as that clown Matt Canada is in charge of that offense. AI generated OC that one. #Dosser
Sorry for Nick Chubb's injury, I hope he can fully return soon.  Steeler Fans know the pain of watching a great man go down.  We've had our share.
This game was MNF in a nutshell. (Get well soon Chubb)
Well at least y'all got DTR on the bench... 🤷🏿‍♂
can't throw can't run.  perfect qb for the browns...
Look at #20 and #77 at 11:38 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Browns out gained the Steelers 408-255 in total yards, ordinarily that would be a 10 point win for the Browns. The Steelers won because of offensive ineptitude of the Browns and benevolent refereeing.
11:39 the interaction between numbers 20 and 77 was hilarious!!
Steelers D- 14 pts Steelers O- 12 pts A win is a win but Canada has GOT TO GO.
Are the Steelers going to use Muth or not?
Butter finger night
As a steelers fan, man do they suck
If deshauns goin to turn the ball over 3 times a game put a fork in the browns
I’m 49res fan I rather have watt the nick
I’m no offensive coordinator but I know that if jet sweep ends at a tfl, you don’t run jet sweep to the other side the very next play.
😂😂 there was like 9 fumbles, this game was awesome
That moment you realize on Week 2, Baker Mayfield had over 100 more yards than Watson, as well as one more touchdown, a higher completion percentage, and zero turnovers (but Watson has a contract that’s worth $221.5 million more) lmao
Get well Nick Chubb.
SORRY BUT THE WHITE HELMETS ARE NOT WORKING.
Pretty much everything went the Steelers' way but the Browns still should have won.
I feel so bad for this defense. Such a talented unit only to be held back game after game by their offense
Those white helmets are awesome
Whoa…what a sloppy game.
Tomlins reaction to Gunners Fumble is Priceless! I knew him coming from NE would be bad. Then one of his first games with us was against NE and he had a costly fumble in that game also. Gunner is terrible. I still remember the pathetic non blocking attempt he didn't make while Pat keep the play alive with balance down sideline probably could've scored if gunner made a decent block.
Steelers defense scoring points is a good sign for the Steelers future
Why did you ignore the kick returner that toe tapped at the 9 yard line?  That led to the Browns first interception.
"So, Great Job Guys." Dr.HunterAgoldbi
ugly win
How much you want to bet the Browns calling Hunt back?
Watson got flagged twice for facemask penalty.  As a QB.  Surprised that didn't show up in the highlights.
The massage therapist are gonna start charging Watson to not get a massage if he keeps looking this bad.
This game was like being stuck behind a really slow driver on a busy 2 lane mountain road.
Am i the only person who has noticed the NFL youtube videos having errors in it? Like they show the same play back to back in like every highlight video now
Never seen a team do consistently less with more. At this point you have to look at coach and management. The playcalling makes the offense unwatchable. It’s run first pass when desperate it’s so predictable.
I've seen fewer commercials during the Super Bowl, and that's 5 hours long.
Only thing I want to see on the ticker today is.... Kareem Hunt signs with the browns 🤷🏿‍♂️
Lol Pittsburgh o line is terrrrrible
Fire Matt Canada
watson sucks.
What an incredibly ugly game... Wow
If not for TJ Watt, the Steelers would have lost this game. Pickett has got to start throwing better or Trubisky isn't looking too bad...
I hate the 🤡 I'm happy Pittsburgh won. The browns are 🤡
BLACK AND GOLD
Should have kept Baker
5:40 that rule needs changed, gotta be the dumbest rule lol as the team still scored but didn’t score what
watson,what a trip if we dont watch it were gonna fall back into that same old mode. playing the worst team in our division.and we cant get a win.the browns havent started the season 2-0.for years.sad.whoever hired watson needs fired today.5 more years of him.i hope not......
The way Watt was looking for Higsmith at the end for the interview knowing that they were both the MVPs of the game and he didn't deserve all the attention alone >>>>>>>> That's my TEAM
Offence needs work but a win is a win
Browns continue to suck they could spend billions on a player and still suck...bottom dwellers once again thats only consistent thing about the browns
Jungle Ball
9 seconds into the game? Wowsers.
We need more defense and bad tackling and learn to cover the field no one should have to cut back and go all the way for a touchdown
FIRE MATT CANADA
Has a QB ever gotten 2 PF facemask penalties in a game?
Poorly played games can be entertaining.
How stupid to split screen the game. Monday Night Football production is terrible. And dont get me started on the music...
Fumblemania
Go steelers
3:09 😂😂big man you had that highlight
Deshaun Watson is getting paid something like $43 million a year. Last night against the Steelers, Watson was the worst QB I have ever seen in an NFL game. He does not have one redeeming ability at all. He hit a couple of passes, but even a blind squirrel finds an acorn occasionally.
The lack of discipline by the offense was disgusting.
Two really incompetent teams. A disgrace, really.
At this point watson needs to go a massage parlor if it makes him good again.
That split screen during the game was atrocious. How desperate are they to try and promote Disney ESPN?  As if football fans didn't know the other game was on.
Matt Canada trying to get kenny picket hurt
some of the worst football I have ever seen played.
Too many fumbles and errors
overpaid gangbanging thugs.....
I loved Nick Chubb man this is heartbreaking 😢😢😢 prayers out for him
Man Amari Cooper looked like a allstar all over again
This was. Sloppy game we need a new offensive coordinator.!! Pre season doesn’t mean anything something has to change
Missing Baker yet?
I feel bad for Chubb, I don't feel bad for Deshaun.
Man for the Steelers fans to cheer for Chubb in this heated rivalry gave me hope in mankind. That was such a class act. This may sound crazy but I’m actually rooting for y’all now
This game was wild 😂😂😂 wtf so many turnovers
Fire Canada.  It’s not working much like last year.
Jaylen Warrens a dog
Bro too many fumbles, Browns should be ran through hell next week for not holding onto the ball
😢 IM SO SORRY FOR CHUBB , GREAT PERSON , PLAYER , TEAMMATE , SHOWS U AGAIN HOW GOD FEELS ABOUT GOOD PEOPLE ,AND BROWNS FANS !
GET RID OF THE TURF ALREADY
Trubisky will be starting by week 5!!
Love those all white Browns uniforms. They should wear those in road games vs Cincy for better contrast between the two teams.
The NFL is doing a horrible job this year with it, published YouTube highlights. They completely missed a scoring play in one of the Packers games. They show a star for the Pittsburgh Steelers being carted off the field in the Browns Steelers game without saying who it was. They show 35 and 8 yard passes without showing long barns, and without even saying who the Steelers quarterback is when he makes a play. The broadcasting is pretty disgusting, and the highlight film is worse.
When we can rid Matt Canada.
Kenny Pick6 is SOOOOOO BAD
Watson is on the payroll, he can play waay better than that and the Cleveland defense deserve better from him.
I was dying laughing at the run at 10:09 when the back reverses field, watch Picket 10:10 - Oh, runs coming back my way, I'm gonna block for my man! One second later, see's big #93 coming 10:11 - Uh, lets find someone else
That Fitzpatrick hit was dirty, Fitzpatrick is a dirty dude , always trying to injure players and think that's physicality..
Minkah Fitzpatrick is the newest in a long line of dirty players to be produced in Pittsburgh. Pathetic and criminal behavior!
As a Steelers fan, i have nothing but sympathy for Nick C… even though it’s my guys he’s usually running past or through it’s always a blast watching him play. I can’t say we would’ve won this game if he would’ve stayed healthy throughout it.   Well wishes, hope the recovery process is smooth and quick.    Side note: Kenny isn’t looking so hot…
When the owner demands the front office and head coach to work with a quarterback they didn't want, you sort of curse the organization. And the Browns were already cursed. Only a fool would think the Browns would win under that ownership. Just crooked to the core.
The Steelers offense NEEDS to do better. D is amazing, kenny needs to find a groove n take advantage
Thank both defenses for this game because the offense didn’t show up! Both offenses played horrible!!!
That was one of the ugliest football games I have ever seen
Both of these teams suck, neither deserved to win this game.
Matt Canada has to go at this point or we are gonna have more yards of defense than offense this year
I'da preferred he went to the hospital instead of chubb, but seeing Watson put up 12 for the other team will get me through the week.
Oh dear, what a shame the Browns pervert at QB isn’t playing very well…🤭
I know nothing about football, but put $100 on the steelers to win and glad I did 🤷‍♂️
As a Steelers fan I hate the browns but never want to see any player be hurt so bad they need to be carried off the field. Hope he has a healthy recovery
Hopefully Chubb can bounce back for the Tennessee game next week 🙏
How many errors??? The worst match I have ever seen..
The steelers' defense got more points than the offense...
How did that baker trade work out Cleveland.
What kind of bs highlight is this. It doesnt show replays of the fumbles or injuries... like wtf
Steelers got lucky
Not throwing dirt on Minkah Fitzpatrick but I’ve been preaching against hits below the knee area. He dove head fist towards the ground and his elbow actually touched first to give him leverage. Ankle tackles are one thing cause most of the time guys are just tripped up. Getting your knee blown apart while planting your foot can end careers. I get you’re trying to stop his legs from moving but you can’t aim higher above the knee where his leg actually has padding and protection? Couldn’t just form tackle and grab his thigh and pull it off the ground? NFL honeslty needs to do something about this and maybe it’ll help preserve the running back position. As a browns fan I’d rather we’d get blown out by 40 if it meant we live to fight another day.
Too bad, the zebras had to turn into donkeys on the last play of the game with a no call for holding !
They was getting it in great game
Fecal matter blunts fecal matter.
I'm a Ravens fan, but even I'm sad seeing Chubb go out like that... One of the most entertaining players in the league! Hoping for a speedy recovery
Browns d line is crazy
Watson was acting real cocky.  Glad he lost them the game, get wrecked massage boy
🙏🙏 prayers for Nick chubb
Well There's Always Next Year Cleveland....Oh Wait. No There's NOT.
Talk about fumbles
Bad win but I’ll take it. Also been  saying that for past 4 seasons as a steelers fan.
Too bad for chubbs, I'm a fortyniners fan but God hate too see that.
As a Steelers fan I’m impressed by the defense but the offense was terrible. My boy Pickens ended with 164 that’s good but if it wasn’t for our D we would’ve lost.
This game was crazy
Always fun to watch these two teams play.  But what's up with those Brown's uniforms, and where's their iconic helmets?
Cleveland Browns will NOT have a winning season for the same reasons of the past 25 years. This season they really do have a good team with one weakness. *That weakness is the QB.*  Why Cleveland paid him Millions is beyond me. *Am I the only one that see this?* *Deshaun Watson is a TERRIBLE QB!*  Now, with Chubbs most likely is gone for the season, Browns will have to throw the ball more. This alone WILL be a disaster!! Watson JUST DON'T HAVE THE SKILL!! Cleveland Browns have screwed themselves AGAIN with  ANOTHER  *terrible*  QB. After watching  the  Browns over 40 years, I can see it. Its not that hard to see. The Browns will be 3rd or last in their division this year, and NO playoff spot. All because of Watson, a QB that just sucks!! To the Management in Cleveland>>> WAKE UP! , before its to late!!
Joe Buck is always commentating during the worst injuries. Prayers for Nick <3
Watson is going to stink up the joint for years, what a browns move. Come back healthy Chubb top two or three backs in the league
Pittsburgh is a Dirty team! Always has been, always will be!!
Najae Harris is a bust
Can’t even show the Chubb injury??? How is that not a Highlight ???
250 million dollars later 🤷🏿‍♂️ and you still can't beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 🤦🏿‍♂️
Bro, why did they not show all of harvins punt, almost every one was pinned in the 10, and one of them was pinned on the one, one of them coulda been pinned on the one
Those Browns uniforms are pretty cool for being plain.
This is really bad for rb’s when the best rb in the league has a potential career ending injury even if he comes back he won’t be the same once stuff starts to dislocate it almost always repeats after trauma and ligaments around it tore yea he might be done. I expect rb’s situation to get worse
Really pathetic that they can't even get highlight without the garbage split screen on top forcing ppl to watch it live
Those division games are tough.
Watson is a dirty quarterback 😂😂.. his face mask penalties could of possibly hurt them players
Who put butter on the ball on the first quarter
Pittsburgh got lucky
Bro Fire May Canada He is torture
Cam Akers?
So painful to watch with all of the errors
Steelers defense is the best offense in the AFC North.
aint no way.
When the face mask penalty was not called for Watson that the world watched. I knew the game was rigged for steelers and turn off the T.V..
What it says is they should've told Canada to hit the road!
Man's game with manly Hazards All of the players know the danger
God forgive me…but I can’t freakin stand Pickett…you’re a NFL quarterback…stop acting like your in peewee
Isn’t Watson the highest paid QB in the NFL
Got to love those Steeler fans must of stand through the whole game cheering it was a wild win for them🏈😲
Watson is not good. Pickett might be worse 😂
...wow
Feels good to see Watson suck.
WHY IS JORDAN AKINS NOT ON THE FIELD
Wow..Browns are for real..but Steelers didn’t give up..what a game..like a playoff game
pickett should leave
Minkah a 304 for that hit. Below the knee face down what was he hoping for cause he wasnt trying to tackle. The hit on jacobi myers last week was clean as far as im concearned with the rule changes we are going to have a bunch of cripples now
Football is boring AF 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🗑️💩
Gunner never completed that catch 🤣 I hope they fix the officiating on the nfl fr 🤦🏽‍♂️💯
Browns missing Baker for sure. get ready for your losing season, it just started
Wow Watson was the reason for 2 Steelers TOs for TD if not for that Browns win , the Fumble recovery really not his to blame but the INT was bad pass on a bad play call .
Nick will get over this to a point an come back for a couple of years but riding the pine is not for his competitive nature so he'll come home to Chubbtown, where we will welcome him with open arms, and he'll live out his life as a happy family man and will probably lend a hand with coaching the Cedartown Bulldogs.
The Browns adopting the 1974 Memphis Southmen look.
Prayers for Chubb & speedy recovery Defensive front played great Wallace was getting torched all night looks like it's time for Porter to start
As a Shanghai Sharks fan, I hope Chubb makes a recovery
As Ravens fans, my son & I stayed up & watched this clusterf*ck of a game in its entirety. Steelers D scored more points than Steelers O. And Watson flagrantly grabbing onto Steeler's facemasks was awful. As a mom, after 3 hours, I just wanted this game stopped so no more players would get hurt. Prayers up for Nick Chubb. The Ravens RB, JK Dobbins, went down in 1st game also & is out for the season.
Good effort by The Steelers. It wasn't pretty but a win is a win. I'll take it.
Chubb could be done for good. Sucks
🎉🎉
WTF is that O-LINE?!?!? Cleveland PLEASE
Stefanski and Watson should be embarrassed....both are garbage at their jobs!
Can't believe people still think Myles Garrett is better than TJ Watt
I never give up on my pittsburgh steelers
When 3 or 4 people fumbled the ball that looked so staged 😂. The NFL is like a circus sometimes. Great game though.
Steelers anit wiinin ship
Both teams missing tons of tackles
Never has a team paid such a high price for losing a game! Nonetheless, GO BROWNS!!! And all the best to Nick Chubb, he's a warrior for sure!
Do more stories on how sports are rigged😂😂😂😂
As a Steelers Fan it’s something missing on Offense from preventing the big plays we need an my Condolences goes out to Nick Chubb he is one of the best RB’s and very entertaining wish him a speedy recovery
Not a fan of the Browns, but they had to play the Steelers and refs.
People wonder why running backs get paid less is because they don’t last. So sad to see Nick Chubb go down
I don’t care I’ve been a Steelers fan my whole life Jaylan warren need the ball in his hand more then no questions 💯
...season over, so very new browns of us.
5:01 I don't understand the angle 23 on the Browns took here...
At this point, I'm assuming that the editor of these videos always includes one repeat scene as some kind of inside joke.  OK.  Ha ha.  Now stop.
Browns got a horrible head coach.
Too many games being decided by bad calls. These refs suck. Unbelievable. And im not a Browns fan.
First and most importantly prayers for Nick Chubb man that was awful. 🙏🏽 the fact that the Steelers D outscored the offense shows something. Fire Matt Canada now.
how did myles smollett do?
Browns offensive line is trash. They can be a much better team if they protect their quarterback
Y’all going soft injury part of the game. Go watch basketball
Browns had every chance
Thank you to every single Steelers fan for your well wishes and respect for Nick Chubb. What a heartbreaking occurrence for a humble GOAT running back. Prayers to #24 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
11:40 Shoutout to Teller and Peterson just vibin
I can’t believe I haven’t seen any comment about the browns defense it’s so underrated this year under swartchz
Deshaun cost them this game with a fumble
My son has never been to a loosing game, thank you Dave  for bringing the win home.
I mean I know they had 2 games going. Do not split my screen to show both now I see nothing.
End of first quarter.. Cleveland 72 rushing yards Pittsburgh -3 😂
The Browns and NY jets are cursed.
As a Georgia local, I'm sorry to hear about Chubb. Hoping for a speedy recovery. Anyways, Deshaun Watson was awful and is such a dirty player. Grabbing face masks twice, shoving a ref? Wth?? Also, the Steelers' defense gave the offense so many opportunities to shut down the Browns and wow, that offense stinks. Matt Canada has got to go.
Deshaun just isnt the same guy... but he's being paid like it.
Start porter over wallace and benton over adams, IMMEDIATELY!
Some qbs look soooo good but mentally just cant win. No matter what team they play for .
That Kenny scramble at 13:45  Was absolutely awful🤣
Even Steelers fans know that hit was dirty
1). Minkah should be suspended for the hit on Chubb. His forward progress was stopped, and he made a direct attack to the knee.  2). One of the worst officiated games I think I have ever seen 3). This Browns Defense is Elite. 4). The Browns have a lot to figure out on Offense 5). Wow Pittsburgh is arguably the worst offensive team in the league.
Most physical game of the year!
DeShaun Watson found a way to lose that game. That's what $250 million dollars pays for. Unbelievable.
Watson looks slow, his arm looks weak, and he can't hold the ball!
Browns should of won this
How Watson is the highest paid player in the NFL is beyond me.
FIRE MATT CANADA
& ppl called Josh Jacobs & Saquan Barkley selfish for wanting to get paid. It’s always the RBs who get the majority of those kinda knee injuries. Prayers to Nick Chubb & his family.
Not a happy ending for Deshawn Watson
Fix your ad placements @youtube
2 teams competing for most mistakes in a game 😂
Steelers Defense: 😎  Steelers Offense: 🤡
I don't blame Watson for that pick 6. Receiver couldn't secure the catch; I wonder if in the future they will create a stat for these "interceptions". But that's just my unpopular opinion, QBs' shouldn't get that as a negative stat' in their QB ratings if it was a tipped ball that lead to an interception. Watson threw that ball accurately at the receiver.
This game was a hot mess and so violent smh
Matt Canada needs to go
It’s on you now deshaun Ik you can do it too
PITT defense . NEEDS some help THE COACH gonna show the tape  an lot of mistakes  too THEY won by luck.
Love that shocked look on browns fans faces at the end of the game. Lmao😊😊😊
Same story different year. Garrett did NOTHING when it mattered. Nothing but garbage time sacks for him. No tackles. No impact plays
Deshawn Watson suck in this game DTR looks like the better QB for the Browns.
11:45 👯‍♀️😆😆
As a Steelers fan thank you tj watt and the defense for always saving the offense a$$
Put Warren in! Najee is not good!
The referees are always their MVP😂
Football is back. 1st quarter told me.
Joe Buck needs to change his verbage.
Same old browns
I don't think I've ever seen a Pittsburgh offense look this bad. What is going on? Pickett looked 3x better last year, and so did the rest of the offense. We thought that was bad last year lol. I hope they can turn it around but man they just looked awful. Defense looked great for the most part though so kudos to the defense.
DeShaun will end up being the most sacked QB of all time mark my words. His pocket awareness is soooo cheeks smh
The media is covering up the cheap shot from Pittsburgh on Nick Chubb’s knee. What a dirty team Pittsburgh is.
Nick Chub's injury was nasty AF I hope he recovers well
I didn’t know that guy famous for harassing 20 massage therapists also played in the NFL
Steelahs gunta supabowwl!!!
Suspend Minkah for the season he targeted chubbs Knee something needs done his injury in return was not enough!
Revelation 3:10 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.
Watson sucks
The correct way the issue of the football field in terms of how one has been a class act before in terms of dominating his game.
Steelers one of the best at winning ugly.  Canada no better than all the past horrible OCs the Steelers manage to hire.  Name me one consistently good OC ever to be on the Steelers sideline.  Hire Leftwich for OC!
Nick Chubb is now out for the remainder of the season so the backups are gonna have to step up the browns should’ve won that game and for the Steelers they look good on defense.
Nfl is rigged
Prayers to Nick Chubb, giant, may his recovery be brief! I miss a consistent attacking team in the Steelers. If we had, we would dominate everything. because the defense is spectacular, nothing happens. 💛🖤
Prayers for Chubb and his family. Also, last call was definitely pass interference
That was brutal
Steelers need a real QB...cough Big Ben
From a Steelers Fan all the best for Nick Chubb prayers sent hate to see any injury happen bigger then the rivalry with that said offense needs to get it together and thank you defense for winning the game Steelers Home Monday Night Win wasn’t the best but will take it
I still don't feel good about Pickett.  There were so many easy throws he missed for first downs.  Not sure what Tomlin sees in him
It's still crazy to me that the Watt family has produced two brothers that are so ridiculously impactful on a game. Still think TJ is the superior Watt and they also have a brother on the other side of the ball. The Diggs family produced a couple of football studs as well, though in a very different way because none of them are giant monsters like the Watts.
F I R E C A N A D A
a wins a win
Time for mike Tomlin to go after this season. We has never been able to put his own team together and win with it
Those calls
I like how are defense was playing this game, however,  out offense need alot of work.  Good game steelers!
I’ll take a ugly win over a ugly lost any day…1-1 baby let’s get it together….Steelers4life
Good lord, both offenses are SO BAD
Thanks Chubb!
It’s not an NFL replay it they don’t show the same play twice lol
KAREEM HUNT.
Prayers for nick chubb 🙏
Put JPJ in instead of wallace, he continually get picked on and burned
Pittsburgh has 2 automatic wins per year but they barely got this one.
Browns got robbed smh
If chubb was playing. We wouldve lost that game smh 😂😂😂
The browns are who we thought they were and the Steelers are a travesty. Bengals will have a chance to pass them in the standing
Watson is clearly overpaid. He reminds me of Capernick.
So the only thing I’ve learned from this game is that TJ watt is one of the greatest defensive players ever. And George Pickens Is the real deal
Watson looks like a dear in headlights
Watson is trash. Stefanski is the worst coach in football. Poor Nick Chubb best running back in football stuck with a garbage team now injured probably for the season.
Minkah dirty, he'll get his
3. Liga Football 🫣
Tackling is horrible, Najee is slow, coverage sucks and Matt Canada....they are crazy lucky to have won that game.
Both these teams look ugly...  The accuracy of these QB's is terrible... It was fun to watch last night though..
When the steerls defense is better at offense than QB Pickett 😂😂
BUT BUT BUT THE PRE SEASON!!!!!  I think we now know why we still have Mason.  And for you haters 🖕🏻👈
Chubb was my fantasy rb as a Steelers fan. First time trying fantasy ever and he gets injured. It’s my fault 😢
shitty highlights missing way to much.. WHY WAS THE  PLAYER CARTED OFF??????
Deshaun TWATson 😂😂😂😂😂
We will be back soon Steelers
Where is the holding of #55?
Now if the steelers played this well against the 9ers you would 2-0. What a joke!
Devastating loss of our best man. Get well soon Mr. Nick Chubb.
I said that if we lose this game, we seek and destroy Matt Canada    I’m still up for it. #HereWeGo
I'm glad they started allowing alternate helmets.
What a bad football game it was with injuries and turnovers . The Colorado Buffaloes was more fun to watch !
Sad for Nick Chubb.  Watson can rot in hell
I think the Browns really only have one offensive question:  How the hell are they going to get out of Deshaun Watson's contract?
NFL editing team, please stop having the exact same play over again.
The Steelers don’t deserve gp
It's kind of embarrassing how badly these videos are edited. Abrupt cuts all over the place.
✝️
Wanna match, oh my godness
Shame on NFL for allowing liar Watson to attack a referee without immediate disqualification as per rule ! Over privileged !
Get rid of matt canada and bring in todd haley or byron leftwhich
As a Bengals fan these pass interference calls or none calls I’ll say have to be addressed….we got screwed on a pass interference call when the WR was the one guilty in our ravens game Sunday…and at the end of this game Porter absolutely should of been called for pass interference but did not. WAKE UP REFS!
First JK Dobbins, Now Nick Chubb! AFC North is brutal! Hope both players have a speedy recovery!
Congrats to the Steelers on getting the win.
Great win for the Steelers despite a high school offense. Get well soon Chubb
This game was bad. No one could keep the ball in their hands. At least we picked up the win though
Browns cannot wear white helmets... It's football blasphemy
The Browns stink again, Watson is a bust, he can't pull off a win against a mediocre Steelers, now Chubb is gone, better luck next year once again.
Pick Hunt back up
I am not a Pickett guy. I much rather have Mitch in.
Prayers up for Chubb. Wore 27 in high school just because of him. Dude is literally my football idol. Hurt when he went down against Tennessee at UGA hurts the same watching it now. Speedy recovery 24 💔💔  Browns should feel optimistic about Ford. Loved him at Cinci when he was playing there in college. He’s a pretty good back too. Won’t be the same without Nick though
Fire Canada! my goodness
The steelers still own the browns
As a giants fan I know my cousin happy 😂
The defense saved my week in fantasy football, so thank you
Baker Mayfield was horrible wasn’t he? Oh I mean Deshaun Watson….say out loud…the QB alone had 30 yards in penalties….overrated!
Kenny aint him, and Watson you are not Jackson
That first play is gonna be huge
So Watson is basically like a really high paid Mayfield.
One of the best games I’ve seen in a very long time! Both teams were hungry. Steelers walked away with the win. 🔥
I was so pissed about Chubb. If he was not injured, i believe they would have beaten the GOD FORSAKEN STEELERS. FACT...Steelers are super dirty players. LETS NOT FORGET CARSON PALMER😡. A speedy recovery for CHUBBS. He is a great player and a stand up dude. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏😅😅
Watson is a backup! He lost the game ! He looks like a rookie making so many mistakes, very indecisive and horrible throwing arm! Browns are done without chubb! !!!  Browns would win all their games if they gave him 30-40 carries establish run then pass
Smh. I've never seen a more pathetic attempt at offense.
any win against the browns and i’m happy but this was just hard to watch last night with our offense
Fire Matt Canada
Stefanski is a terrible coach.
Let me just say something as a Bills fan.  They criticize Josh Allen for running the ball in a situation where he MIGHT have fumbled in the Raiders game.... and then I look at this game.  SLOPPY!!!! Both teams need work.
The Steelers need a whole new couching staff, it's the same old thing year after year with Tomlin he's a good couch just not a great couch, great couches when championships
Steeler's coverage in the beginning was good.  That sucks that Chubb is gone, I thought CLE was a contender.  Was Watson always this stupid as a QB?  Or is this part of the Browns' curse?
Man this was hard to watch. 2 really bad teams just seeing who can lose it.   And my Browns won the losing battle as usual. And we lost Chubb what a great night smh 😔
Kenny P needs to improve his skills pass two games he looks lost let’s Go Steelers wake up
Pittsburgh needs to find a offense if they don’t they are not going to win many games,the Browns are going to be in every game
Cleveland O-line in those last 6 minutes was truly exhausted⁉️⁉️⁉️
I literally got ill when Nick got hurt. Man I hope he recovers. Great team guy.
Watson was the best player Pittsburgh had on the field. Good luck Nick Chubb.
Amazing how the NFL cheats for the Steelers, and how the Steelers hurt players and get away with it.
That was a cheap shot at Chubb.
wow 0:08 number 88 didnt even try to trip the guy or throw himself into the guy so he can go out of bounds..watson never really tried to throw the ball away when the pocket collapsed..i mean how obvious can it get its rigged....and these fanboys will eat it up and say its not lol ..im from over seas im not a fan of either of these teams just incase the fanboys try to bring that up
how many times do they fumble these teams are bad
Deshaun is trash
I feel like Watson pocket awareness got worse
Stefanski is a horrible coach. Haslam is a horrible owner.
CUT. PICKETT. NOW.   And fire Matt Canada.  Aim for a top 5 pick next year, to get a REAL quarterback. Pickett's ceiling is Daniel Jones
The Cleveland  QB was unimpressive to say the least. Very sad news for all football fans to see Nick Chubb gone for the season if not what would have been a HOF career. Reminds one of the Joe Theisman career ending injury.
Fire Mike Tomlin
The Steelers did every possible thing to lose this game, and they won it.  Watson is nothing like who he was in Houston, not even close, and if we're going to pretend he's going to get better, think again.  The Browns bought damaged goods, and in very true Browns fashion, they bought high.  I don't want to hear anymore it's only been two games, it's only been four games, it's only been six games, wait till next year.  This is next year and it's been two games, he stinks, his accuracy and decision making are extremely puzzling.  I still firmly believe in karma, and Watson has the worst karma you can possess.  They're going to be lucky to squeeze out a winning season.  And it's not just an overreaction to this game, look at the way they lost, look at the way they played, and look at Watson's play in particular.  The sacks that he took, I mean those are rookies mistakes sacks.  Protect the ball and run, or throw it away.
Kenny Pickett is actually such a man of a QB for that block at 10:09. A lot of other QBs just retreat, but him blocking guaranteed that Harris had room to run. He has a lot of room to grow as a passer, but he hopefully earned a ton of respect off of that one.
Shame,shame,shame on Steelers offense. They suck ! Pickett suck ! We have the worst offense in the league. Najee Harris , the RB, suck ! How can you have a starting RB can only give 2 big runs in the entire game? He shouldn't be a starter and he 's useless. He suck!  RB Warren is a better RB and should be the starter. Pickett suck! He is not Mobile and he stands in the pocket like a statute.  In the NFL, you cannot win a pocket QB.  That's the real fact.  Pocket QB cannot win the Super Bowl.  Those days are gone in the NFL.  To win, you have to get an athletic QB.  Steelers need to get an athletic QB from college next draft pick.  He cannot even use his legs to get 1,2 or 3 on a 3rd down play. He just stands there and throw incomplete, interception, or take a sack.  Stands in the pocket and contribute nothing to help the offense. Terrible! We need a mobile athletic QB now if we want to go to the Super Bowl and win it.  Pocket QB cannot  and that style of QBing is outdated in the NFL.  Sorry, but it's the truth. Our entire offense suck big time. Worst I'hv seen this season in the entire league. Worst in the AFC North, and worst in the NFL. The OC Canada suck ! He needs to go. Not impressed with QB Pickett and RB Harris. They suck ! That's my take on my beloveth Steelers.
39 should be fined for going for knees while in traffic like that. Makes it seem like it was intentional to hurt him.
Good W
Ok what the hell happened to the Browns uniforms/helmets? I thought the Steelers were fighting Penn State for a second lol.
This division is CRAZY good!
I know the browns fans would be brought back to earth this week BROWNS fan were buying there SUPERBOWL tickets  taking 17 and 0  $hit 😂😂😂 people your in Cleveland 😂😂😂😂😂BROWNS DONT GO TO SUPERBOWLS 😂😂😂😂😂
Very good game tonight Browns and I’m very sorry about what happened to Nick Chubb. A man with very great potential that may be cut because of the injury. Sending prayers 🙏
Ayy good game yall boys..ima just pray for Chubb and move on from this one❤ain’t gon say nothing negative (browns fan)
Canada needs to go for us to win
I'm glad the Steelers won but I feel terrible for Nick Chubb. Praying for a speedy and full recovery.
It wasn't sexy, but it had teeth.
Apparently you can put your hands on the ref.
If Nick Chubb doesn't get hurt, we lose this game. I hope he can bounce back from this injury. On to the Steelers. I have no idea if the Rooneys are The Jones family from Dallas, but they just keep a low profile and are forcing Tomlin's hand, but if they aren't then Tomlin is to blame for the garbage we continue to see. What really pisses me off is that we have Hall of Fame Talent with TJ. All pro talent with Highsmith, Minka, and Heyward, and it is all been wasted because we play garbage soft zone on defense and our offense is unwatchable. Today Defense scored more TDs than our offense. For the year, defense 2tds, offense 2tds. Pathetic.
Apparently you can put your hands on the ref.
As a Bengals fan i got to say the Browns white Helmets look good !
Watson needs to give back some money.
Joey Porter Jr!
Sorry for Chubb but WATSON lost them that game... Can't believe they're paying him that much
can someone please explain the on filed ruling regards to the fumble play at 3:00? what happens if neither team is able to recover the fumble football assuming they did rule that a catch and fumble by gunner
You guys really aren't gonna show the bick chubb play? I'm sure you'll package that as protecting him so how but it's more about protecting the nfl
I feel bad for Steelers fans watching Matt Canada in action every week. It’s rough when your OLB’s score half the points
This is one of the sloppiest games I've seen in a long time. Watson isn't worth 1/4 of $250 million, he's an average QB at best.
Watt = electric energy!
Joe Buck is annoying as usual. "pass is.... caught!"
Nothing to see here if you are looking for good offense highlights.
Steelers scored more points on defense than offense!
Deshaun Watson, ladies and gentlemen. Meanwhile, Baker is 2-0 and loved by actual fans of the game. Also, hated by casual fans who only know how to parrot idiot talking points made by mainstream media hacks.
From others videos, it sure looks like they targeted that knee
Honestly i have zero faith in Kenny Pickett, he cant play dead in a horror movie
The amount of fumbles this year is just ridiculous
The pain my team gives me. Salute 🫡 Chubb
CLEVELAND WON 🏆
Take aways from this game as a Browns fan.  - Chubbs injury is first and foremost. You can't replace a player like that. Jerome Ford cannot fill his shoes.  - Jones did well for a rookie in his first start against someone as good as Watt. For the most part Jones neutralized Watt. Watt won but he didn't have the game some thought he would have.   - Watson is looking more and more like his old self. It was hard to tell with the constant pressure on him but he was doing a good job of making passes. Some of that can be attributed to the Steeler defense and their constant pressure and efforts to contain Watson in the pocket.  - Watson needs more time to throw or adjust the play calling to get rid of the ball faster.  - The Browns need to hold onto the ball better and cut out the untimely penalties. Minus those the Browns probably win comfortably seeing as that the Steeler's offense looked horrible. Pickett doesn't look like a long term solution for them at QB.  - Stefanski needs to adjust and adapt quicker. The difference in the game was Tomlin recognizing and making adjustments quicker than Stefanski. I don't suggest Stefanski won't be a good head coach though. Tomlin has been a coach in this league for over a decade and a half while Stefanski has only been coach for thee seasons. Stefanski will learn  - Watson twice was called for face mask penalties. To be fair to Watson I think he felt that grabbing onto the face mask was now legal since the Steelers have made a practice of grabbing Watson's face mask blatantly without calls being made. Last year's non call had Watson looking out his ear hole without any call and this years was almost as bad.  - The Browns will get past this and are likely to probably win in the next meeting in Cleveland. The Browns are better than they performed on Monday night.  However the Steelers don't look much better and look like they're in for a difficult season. As I said I don't think Pickett is a long term answer and he's extremely inconsistent. The Steelers will be constantly have weeks were they look good and weeks where they look bad.
Start dtlr
Watson has a terrible offensive tackle and guards
Also I’ve never been a fan of the gunner signing
Steeler's offensive line can't open holes again this year, they can't protect the qb well, Steeler's are still not a good football team. No contract for Tomlin for this Steelers fan, he has not produced a team that can win down the road for a long time now...
Prayers for chubb
Definitely seems like the Browns lost this game more so than the Steelers winning it. Easily could have had it if it weren't for those comedic fumbles.
The ads on this app are getting ridiculous
L for a poverty franchise, gotta love it
That was such an an idiotic tackle from Fitzpatrick
Thanks for giving up on baker. Stupid browns org. 🤡💯🤣
I know JPJ only got a hand full of reps tn but I think it was enough to see that he needs to start over Levi Wallace. Levi Wallace got cooked on every play last night. Especially by Amari Cooper. Everytime they put JPJ on cooper, Tho it wasn’t many he locked down his route everytime. Steelers need to understand it’s ok to start rookies. If they are ready don’t waste them
Both teams offenses look miserable.
"Steelers win the game but both team facing offense-ive questions" Had me thinking a major Steelers offense player went down too
Hope nick Chubb recovers he’s a great dude. That being said steelers I think it’s time Canada goes
Bad luck for Chubb but lost in all that is how bad Watson is.  The Browns are doomed with that contract.
Get well Chubb #SteelersNation
another rigged and woke waste of a sport
I hope Chubb gets better quickly 🙏 He doesn't deserve to end his career like this. Still, what a crazy game.
That was one of the craziest games I've ever watched.... I can't make this shh up
#brownstillsuck #HEREWEGO
I thought Deshaun Watson was supposed to be good
This is like the steelers of old .  All defense... solid lil rush attack shaky offense... championships!!!!!
Losing chubb for the season pretty much dooms Cleveland’s chances this year. Watson is not good enough to carry this team like chubb did. Well there is always next year.
I love football but the Nick Chubb injury made me lose a little love for the game. Just hearing Nick Chubb on the ground screaming was crazy, this was the dirtiest game I’ve seen since the nfl made rule changes.
Watt and Highsmith are the best edge rushing duo in the league and it’s not close
Is anyone else noticing how Najee Harris runs?   He runs like a billboard on legs - straight up and slow.  I can run faster. He tries -very hard but he’s no game breaker.
Get well Nick Chubb. Prayers up.
Watson was running for his life the entire night, that O-line is atrocious.
As a steeler fan i think we can say we are in qb purgatory. I dont think picket has what it takes
Go refs.... refs are ruining this wonderful game.
Ravens all alone at the top😂 Great game tho!
Lol classic poverty franchise of the Steelers injuring our best player to win a game…pathetic team pathetic fan base pathetic all around.
Matt Canada needs to go....
The offensive couldn't move the ball a yard sad
The NFL has been rigged for many years.
Get Harrison Bryant outta here get Kareem hunt back defensive was amazing last night offense was complete garbage
I have a theory about Matt Canada. I think he's really a double agent. He calls plays that blatantly sabotage the Steelers offense and designed to lose the game. That's the only explanation I can think of.
We got some work to do on the offense for sure. I'll take this win tho
Refs and announcers both working and rooting against the Browns. So many bad call in this game.
I'm glad to see the reaction when Chubb went down. A collective gasp from all the Steelers fans. No cheering. Chanting his name out of respect when he was carted off the field. He's the best running back in football. Hope he gets back fully recovered soon.
Remember all the talk about the Steelers offense in the preseason? All nonsense. Took 2 defensive TDs to win this one, going to be a long season. Btw, hate Browns all white helmets, doesn't fit at all.
Exciting game! Man the Steelers are bad, so I guess that makes the Browns really pathetic. I mean the Steelers were manhandled by an overrated & inconsistent Niners team that won't even make the playoffs!
Steelers constantly bsing their way to wins like this one are why the Tomlin Steelers never have a losing record.
Entire Brown's team needs new gloves. They cant hold on to the ball to save their lives.
It's going to be scratch n claw all year. This offense needs to mature, the defense is in good form. I'm not really a big fan of Canada but you can't lay it all on him.
Steelers are a hot mess.
Watson is TRASH!!!!!!!!
This was a good game last night.
So my Najee jersey is getting trashed today....
We own Ohio
Chubb is the Browns. Watson needs to go! cut your losses now Cleveland
Welp our offense is absolute trash....
The offense has such potential. The weapons are there it's just held back by worse than madden play calling. Seriously how does Canada still have a job?
Fire Matt Canada
DeBlk Watson the perv (who has the look in his eye of a fatherless 15 year old theif) can't read a D or make quick decisions. You can tell he already knows there is no SB in his future
This game looked ugly from the highest 🤣
Watson sucks...  Simple
If nick finish the game we loose by the 2 they gave up
Even though I’m glad Pittsburgh won, I just want to say, that I hope Nick Chubb is alright, I know what it’s like to lose a team player due to injury.
Cleveland has a terrible OC. Nothing underneath or released. Watson looked like he was a HS quarterback, waiting for he receives to get open.
As a browns fan. This loss means nothing. I’m just worried about Nick Chubb. And big respect for Steelers fans for the love they showed to Nick Chubb being carted off the field. You guys definitely have my respect after that.
What is this the Cleveland whites
Nick Chubb please come back soon
It’s crazy how the Steelers offense has only put up 14 points in these first 2 games wtf?🤣🤣🤣 I’m a Steelers fan go defense!!!
From a Steelers fan that lives in Cleveland I have so so much respect for him and the standing ovation was so nice. But Najee didn’t play well
4:19 "Pickett....gets pounded"
Steelers defense is also their offense, 8-8 season
So kobe is playing football now huh ok rigged sport.
That qb draw at 3rd and 1 is exactly the pain steelers fans feel with Matt Canada at the helm
The Steelers are so bad. Imagine getting a 7 point handicap ♿️ on the 1st play and the star RB out and barely wining. Kenny P us terrible. And that non PI call 🙄
I love all the Steelers fans n the comments showing love, respect and prayers for Chubb! Classy!!!!!
That injury on chubb was hard to watch, and almost appeared intentional with how Minkah rolled his body into Chubb's knee. Still heartbreaking to see the heart of our offense go down.   We need to get rid of watson though, he's a liability to an amazing team irregardless of what happened. The only thing he touches is massage girls and facemasks, not the end zone.
If Watson just throws the ball out of bounds vs taking sacks, browns win easily. He sort of plays hero ball....all or nothing.
For the life of me, I do not understand why the Browns when they had 3 &1  Try to pass, then had 4&1. Try to do a quarterback bootleg. when you have the best running back in the league on your team.
Why are the Cleveland Browns copying off a High School team? First a the logo center field and now uniforms? 😂
There is so much hype with the steelers before the season. And the way they have been playing  shows how wrong everyone is. Bog disappointment
Deshawn Watson is not very good.
As a Browns fan I am so disappointed. We played bad. Smh
the browns are so boring to watch, i was watching the end of this game last night and even though it was the 4th qtr i was so bored after 5 minutes i turned it off.
Nick chubb has now dislocated that same knee twice… sadly concerned that he won’t be the same running back
DeBlk Watson is not a leader of men. He is a perverted fatherless low I.Q. con artist with great athletic ability. There is no SB in his eyes.
Watson should not  b playing at all....I will not watch...nfl let's people like him play
Bro if not for our Defense 🤦🏾‍♂️ come on Big Burgh we got to do better ⬛️🟨
Too many commercials
Sponsored by butterfingers
🙏🏿🙏🏿the best for Chubb💙🐐
The split screen and continuous update on the other games is annoying, ESPN get rid of it
Fly 🦅 Fly
That was a weird football game
Steelers had Josh Dobbs on the roster a few years ago They dumped em for Kenny pick6 Dobbs almost won a game Sunday on a team thats intentionally trying to lose. That dude is way better than Kenny Pick6
Steelers offense is atrocious!!!!!!
I remember Watsons rooke year when he finallly got to go in a game to play he was so amazing He had Hopkins to throw to but he still used his feet to get first downs and touchdowns I picked em up in Fantasy and he won me a bunch of games back to back until he got hurt in practice  Like over 30 point fantasy games for em every game What happened to that dude
This game was what MNF is all about 💯
Just what the Steelers needed, a game against a high school team
Ol Kenny still not looking the best...that D showed up tho...think they heard Jersey Jerry saying Watt was the only one playing with heart lol
Steelers got like 2 good Defensive players And George Pickens  Doubt they make the playoffs
They should just let TJ Watt play QB too, who can stop him?
We paid a bum.  And those all white uniforms are ugly asf
What a seasaw game!! The Steelers defense looked like some monsters and won the game for Pickett, Pickens is a beast, browns offense is looking stagnant without Chubb 🙏, Watson has to show and prove now 🏈, Ford showed some signs of promise to back up as running back , Cooper made some big catches, browns play calling is  very questionable
having the games on at the same time is absolute trash
First play Kenny Pick6 throws a pick 6
Horrible to see Chubb go down, injuries just suck. Too may turnovers, if the Browns can correct that they’ll be good to go. GG though.
This new rule of coating the ball with cooking grease is really making the games exciting this year!
i stayed up to watch this game (got 2 hrs of sleep) but holly hell was it worth it. such a crazy game. LETS GO STEELERS!
Chubb Maaaaan , why couldn't it been Watson. God is cruel for this.
❤❤❤❤❤❤QB OVERRATED PICKLER  TO SO SO🎉🎉🎉 MONSTERS DEFENSE 👻 👽 😒
There has been a lot of really bad football the first 2 weeks.  This game was horrible.
Great win Steelers
It's so good to see the predator lose. NFL is a pos organization to even let him play.
Two very beatable looking teams I love it
Najee sucks. Cut ✂️
kenny pickett just looks defeated lmao still got 15 more weeks to go buddy
Prayers for Nick Chubb
39 is a piece of trash for hitting chubb like that steelers knew only chance to win was hurt chubb
Watt>>>Garrett
As a Steeler fan, Nick Chubb is just about the only Brown i have respect for.  I hope he has a good recovery and comes back better than ever.
I knew that would be a good game!!
FIRE MATT CANADA
What an awful game.
Next game is in Cleveland…no chance the squealers win it. The browns will get their revenge you can believe that.
Watson is a bust… we could’ve won this game for sure.
Nfl needs to go back to one game on monday nights and no thursday night games...it should be all on sundays...and pittsburgh needs a better offensive line
The Steelers defense won them this game. If their offense was better, this team would be really good.
Pickens...Pickett...Pick Six lmao what ah squad full of great name's 😅🍻🍺
Когда не стандартный счёт с отрывами это всегда весело..!))
With the defense winning this game..the offense better tighten up because its a reason why RB Najee Harris was the number 1 pick. It's to run through holds..not get hit at the line and behind the line.  It's also a reason why the  QB Kenny Pickett was the number 1 pick. It's because he's young and have the mobility to move the ball. He didn't to that.  I like the game except for Chubb that went out. I don't like to see that.
1 blown coverage TD and 2 defensive TDs is unacceptable! Sloppy football smh... browns defense is legit though and they did all they could to keep this game close but Watson with Chubb now done for the season has to step up and carry the offense and his indecisiveness is making me lack confidence in him doing that... Chubb injury is such a gut though, I pray he'll be able to come back and be himself some point next year🙏🏼
Old school, smashmouth, hard hitting, defensive football. Good game minus the Chubbs injury.
Man steelers offense is so bad.
feel bad for Chubbs and i’m a huge steelers fan got so much respect for that guy Mr.Chubb. I will try to get Jonathan Taylor if i’m the Browns
I’m so happy the browns lost 🤣🤣
That hit on Chubb was a dirty hit. It was helmet to the knee.
Matt Can'tnada
Chubb, Barkley, Beckham...they're dropping like flies, ya'll.
Watson sucks
Truly tho best wishes and prayers for Nick Chubb, worst injury I’ve seen for a RB in a long long time , an absolute class act and lethal on the football field , hope for a successful surgery
For the first time i actually like the Brown's jerseys
That Steelers defense is a menace
Watch Fitzpatrick he clearly targeted Chubbs knee. Typical dirty Smellers player
Wholesome moment 11:39 😂😂
Browns offense is basic and boring, with no excitement and creativity. Booo, the coach has no intensity, which the players feed off of. He has no urgency, and the players have no ball control at all.
I feel bad for Nick Chubb, I hope he has a full recovery. Never take the Steelers lightly, I don't care what their record is, and Browns fans made the mistake in underestimated them. They thought this was an easy game. This was a lesson for them.
No more white uniform for the browns
Man, the Browns curse continues......
If Watson had thrown a better block that would’ve been a touchdown for number 34 of the Browns @8:02
WE SHOULD BE 0-2…. This win will only give Pittsburgh fans false hope… Matt Canada needs to be sent home. He has ZERO intuition for play calling. And after how many years has this man tried running a jet sweep on second and long and it hasn’t been successful??? Stop calling that play. Rip up that play in your book. IT DOES NOT WORK!!!!! I’m tired of it.
BLACK AND YELLOW ALL DAY !!!🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤💛🖤
Them some ugly browns jerseys. Was there a Harris sighting in this game😄😄
Well the Browns did what they do best!  The team is cursed and seems like they always will be.
Chubb was 10 Carrie’s for 64yds yet the first time I see him in these highlights is being carted off 🤷‍♂️
Steelers won by their defense and some luck lol.. Offense sure wasn’t doing anything
Jp jr need to start pat p terrible so is Wallace
That's was a very bad no call at the end
The Browns ruined the QB market and fir what? Watson is not a great QB, I never liked him in college!! He was throwing to wide open pro quality recievers!!
Nick better get his money, they ran him like a dog this game just for him to get hurt. Browns still got that career-ending factor to them I see.
Ya Pickett ain't there yet O-Line  is bad and O Coord. ain't hitting on much but at least we don't have a bum QB we spent waaaay to much for, while one they sent away is 2-0
For football players, the hope is to pocket a few million before your body gets ruined. Better to be poor and healthy than rich and crippled.
Wow... The fact that steelers took away the ball 4 times, the browns had almost 100 yards in penalties, missed field goals, lost their prime time RB, and only win by 4 shows how bad Steelers offense is
BIG PITTSBURGH STEELERS FOOTBALL BABY. In games like these, they ALWAYS find a way.
Let's go Steelers this game was crazy game the Steelers you guys have too don't give up Steelers play smart football Steelers let's go Steelers let's go Steelers 🖤💛🏈🏈💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Question: 3.04- Steelers fumble, picked up by Browns, the ball is juggled around and finally goes out of play. Is the rule here that the Browns player had secured the fumbled ball before it was lost again and therefore Browns have the possession? Seems that way to me but would like clarification, not having the full game and the situation here being a bit vague as to the exact rule.
So it will be Baltimore and Cindy competing for the division then....good to know.
Watson sucks hairy balls
Our defense is good but we would’ve got violated if Chubb doesn’t go out. Best guy I’ve seen at just running through contact
Got to love it when you don't want the score of the other game... Yet, for some reason, the network puts the score of the other game in the dumbest possible spot 🤦‍♂️
12:47 play of the game saving his glasses
steelers got bailed out by the refs SO BAD
You tube has more commercials then the actual game has WTF. Aholes
The Steelers won because the Browns made a lot of mistakes! Not because of their swiss cheese offensive line and constantly blitzing defensive line! 55 rushing yards? That's it? Nick Chubb had 64 before getting injured! The Steelers are a disaster!
Man I’m mad Cleveland loss like y’all got do better Pickett is trash of u lose to the Pittsburgh u trash this year
Watson has got that 200m dollar contract and he brings nothing to the table..now that Chubb is out clevend offence is done for the season also..
Special shoutout to ESPN for the 10 minute dual screen that nobody asked for. If i wanted to watch New orleans, and nobody does, id switch the channel. Dont do that again
Nick Chubb might be the best RB in the League if the Steelers has a offense they would be Dangerous with that Defense
2:59 if that’s a fumble, then the play in the SB was as well
That Chubb injury has to be the worst I’ve ever seen… I hope he’s able to recover and doesn’t lose a single step. The guy has always been a class act
Why are the steelers standing 10 yards back from their receivers? Just giving up 6 to 8 yard pass chunks all game
They coming after Russell Brand but Watson playing like nothing ever happened… you don’t live in a free country if the laws aren’t enforced equally
TJ Watt made history in the scam multiple times, and that was the highlight.
Warren had a monster game
BROWNS LOOSE THE GAME BECAUSE OF DESHAUN WATSON INCOMPETENCE AND HIS LIMITED INTELLIGENCE
Matt Canada has dirt on the Rooney's.
when are we going to talk about refereeing in the NFL... it's a disaster, a joke
One of the worst offensive showings I have ever seen by the Steelers, pretty much beat ourselves on offense. If it wasn't for the defense scoring two touchdowns we would have lost that game, thankfully we have such a dominant defense led by TJ Watt
They pay Watson how much??? What a waste of money.
Who else thinks we need to start Jaylen Warren over Najee Harris?
WILLS IS A CRIMINAL
Canada has to go
a win is a win....but Pickett played like he was the last pick in the draft. He was AWFUL!!!AWFUL!!!!! AWFUL!!!!! he Defense played great desperate football and won that game...T.J. Watt won that game for Pittsburg
Steelers didn't look super good but a win is a win.Anything is better than last week's game
I had about a 7% chance of winning in fantasy… then Steelers defense came in clutch
Best QB in AFC North Lamar Jackson will run through these teams ✊🏽
Sad day when Matt Canada is more employed than nick chubb. Hope he gets better fast and Canada gets an aneurism so we can have both teams at full strength to duke this out properly.
Watt? Watt!!!
Steelers have a tough stretch of games coming up and I hope they lose more than seven of them and they are going to get absolutely crushed by the Browns in Cleveland Browns stadium in November it will become all unglued
My browns wearing there 1895 jerseys 😅😂
Fuc*ing molestator-Watson!!
Wow, in a league of great quarterbacks, these are 2 of the worst.
One of the ugliest MNF games I’ve ever watched.
The Browns lost but those all whites make them look like champions for the first time in their existence.
Ima browns fan and ik are offense is horrendous but are defense is top 5
That dude who dropped that pass to have it intercepted will be on the bench the rest of the year if I was the coach.
I don't know about Pickett man. his accuracy is all over the place.  Jets and Browns trying to out-do each other in the "what franchise is more cursed" department.
Steelers football
Minkah Fitzpatrick has completely ruined things for the Cleveland Browns thanks to him Nick Chubb is out for season with that Browns will never win the division and make the playoffs I'll never get to see it again I'll never get to see them win the division ever 😭😭😭😭😔😔😔😔😔😔😔 it's not fair at all I would give and do and trade anything for God to protect the Cleveland Browns from the injury-plague I let God know that I don't expect any more of the Browns players to get hurt or we will not make the playoffs or win the division I need him to go out there and protect them from the remainder of the season protecting the Browns from injuries is very important but overall I will be praying for Nick Chubb as well
Browns need a new QB
I'm not one to enjoy someone getting hurt, but every time Watson gets sacked I hope something breaks and ends his career. Watson getting crippled couldn't be a better outcome.
COME ON BROWNS!🇺🇸
This browns are not your browns.
ɯɔʞǝɯ иwɐɹон хdǝʚʚ
Thank to our Defence because our offence can’t get a single thing going, gotta figure it out soon i was hopeful after preseason but first two games are looking weak
The biggest news from this game is the injury to Nick Chubb and the NFL didnt show it in the game highlights? That's not a credible response. I missed the game on TV; the nfl has a responsibility to provide the news as a matter of record. This isnt a morbid complaint as much as an accountability one.
Watson is awful.
Thanks tj watt. I needed that win to complete my parlay
All Steelers fans sending prayers to Nick Chubb first and foremost, thank you. To the ones who refuse to acknowledge it and try and harp on the Browns or Watson, shame on you. I would be extremely disappointed in myself. And dont bring Watson up without acknowledging Kenny Pickett is an unfortunate bust thus far. I hate to say it but he isnt the guy either. Idk what to tell you. We are both screwed. Incredible defense on both teams, not a QB in sight.
Qb is trash lol
browns uni's is nice nice 🔥🔥🔥
Questionable play calling by the Steelers at the end of the game 🫣
Levi Wallace been getting cooked both games time for JP Jr. to start
That home ref cooking 🧑‍🍳
what a bad game from both teams.
Can we just take a moment to appreciate Ford's effort on that run
AFC North Is The Best Division
all these graphids and split views and live scores are getting out of hand, the live score is so dumb it ruins the other game for everyone
Still don't understand why they would choose to have both of these MNF games at the same time.
2 mistakes Watson just cannot make the pick 6 and the fumble returned for a Td  Browns defense only gave up 12 points  They’ll b good tho great game by both teams
@nfl stop showing the winners on thumbnail
Watson lost that game for them
As a steeler fan we have to let Kenny go
Way to go Steelers 👏👏🎉💙💙💙
Imagine paying Deshaun Watson that kinda money for this kinda play.
Watson simply a bad QB
So scripted it's exciting! LoL 😂
As a Steeler fan we haven’t always won pretty, but this game was gut wrenching to watch😅
Ford went off tonight
God watson is so trash
I’m a ravens fan  I can’t believe y’all won this game  The moment was on Cleveland side  Tough win way to steel this game 😂
1:44 am i crazy ?? That FG looks good to me
Cooper is toughhh to deal with 🔥🙏🏾
Omg Pickett and Pickens are trouble!!! I think they finna go crazy with the stats this year 🔥🙏🏾
Watson is bad
The fact that people keep saying it’s Pickett is wild to me if you watch the game he looks super uncomfortable with the play calls like some of play I highly doubt he wants to run but as second year player he probably feels like he doesn’t have that voice to make certain changes yet if you recall bens last years some of them games we would’ve lost if Ben didn’t run his own plays or switch the play the common denominator is Canada his play combinations on the drives are terrible the inside run wasn’t working all game but he still ran it there then we end up in a 3rd and 13 now Pickett is forced to try pick up a 3rd and long every time don’t get me wrong Pickett  has missed some passes I’m not going to look pass that but with the play calls being so inconsistent so far these last 2 games he hasnt really had a chance to get in a rhythm and that’s important for a qb so as loyal steeler fan they gotta change the offensive coordinator it’s been time 💯
We need Canada gone !!! Where my Steelers fans at  ? & can agree !!!👇🏼👇🏼
Deshaun Watson is garbage over paid and over rated, your qb is 2-0 in Tampa, way to go cleveland. Rip nick Chubb.  Your were the best bro.
It's over Cleveland..chubb next yr won't be the same.second time he's had this injury
If Ben had this defense during those 2014-2018 years, we’d have atleast two more rings.
This was one of the most aggressive games I’ve seen in a min, they were head hunting out there
Thr browns are gonna brown sometimes.
As a Chargers fan, i gotta say philly cheesesteaks are good As a Cardinals fan, I don't like the new york stock exchange  As a Texans fan, I like watching crime documentaries  As a Bears fan, I like going potholes on the road  As Ravens fan, I gotta order pizza with a ton of pineapple  As a Seahawks fan, I like using Apple products more than Microsoft  As a Bills fan, I have to say finance classes over IT classes any day of the week  As a Dolphins fan, I gotta admit taking showers with ketchup is niiice  WE. DO. NOT. CARE. WHO. YOU. CHEER. FOR. STOP. STARTING. YOUR. COMMENTS. WITH. WHO. YOU. ARE. A. FAN. OF.
12:13
These 2 teams are so similar in that they come into the game with both flaws and something to build on. In the end, Steelers D saved the day both on defense and offense. Prayers to Nick Chubb, that injury looked really bad. Hope he recovers to full strength...
Steelers are garbage plain and simple. we gotta stop kiddin ourselves with these bad qbs and offense. every week is a let down even with a dub
Sorry to say this browns if you had any hopes of going to the super bowl this year. Forget it giving the other team the game isnt the way to do it.
Not convinced the Browns are better off without Baker Mayfield. And he’s now 2-0 down in Tampa Bay.
I dojt care what nobody saids i take tj watt over parson anyday best defense player in nfl my opinion
Thoughts and prayers with Nick Chubb. I hope he stays strong mentally. Always a class act and one of the best football players of his generation 🙏
Why are NFL highlights this poor? How do we go from Cooper making a play to Chubb getting carted off without even seeing the play that led to the injury. Dont even get me started on how highlights are repeated or missed field goals aren't included. Just poor poor highlights 😠😠🚮
Longtime Steelers fan here: Start Mason Rudolph and see how much better the offense is. It is not Matt Canada! Kenny Pickett is just not  the answer. Been saying it 2 years now. There are open receivers and Kenny Pickedoff cannot find them. He is scattershot most of the time. Play Rudolph!
Matt Canada has to go!
steelers offense was horrendous to watch
How is Watson one of the highest paid qbs?   His not even that good
We need to get rid of Levi Wallace. 2 games in the row he’s getting beat
As a Steelers fan after this game I've came to an honest conclusion with myself. Kenny Pickett is average in athletic ability and NFL QB measurables and we're gonna need a master genius play caller to consistently put up any kind of big passing yds with him. And even though our lines not great you'd expect any first round RB to turn bad plays into something good every now and then and Najee can't. If Warren was better at Pass blocking he definitely deserves to be the starting back he's more explosive runs better routes out of the backfield and is was more shifty.  We need middle linebackers period. We can't stop the run at all and it's hard to win on average if you can't stop the run in the AFC north.
What a comedy. Rough year for for both towns
Rip nick chubbs career 😔 dislocated knee and every ligament in his knee torn
Fire Matt Canada. Defence carried all the way this game but our offence has to up their game. Also, fire Matt Canada
Cleveland had too much turnovers!!!
-перечеркнутый текст-
Myles garrett was elite tn….
Some were not wrong about the AFC North will go crazy. This game is the example of it.
Serial Watson should have been ejected for pushing a ref like any other player would be...👎
_курсив_
*житрный текст*
browns spent all that money, time and legal woes for a QB who isn't even in the top 20.
Fire Canada
That surfboard celebration was harddd
The last time Steelers ever lost a MNF game was 32 years against NY Giants in 1991
A win is a win , but. The way we won it? Is very questionable, Fire Matt Canada
11:38 #20 got #77 dancing with him after his team fumbled 😂😂😂
The NFL hands the Steelers layups at home every year on MNF. No wonder they win so much.
Najee is trash
Think what you want about Big Ben, but he knew to move the offense fown the field... Canada and Pickett obviously can't figure it. If the offense is still like this midway through the season. Its time to draft another quarterback.
Watson looked like he was fighting for his life in there
Watson getting paid the big bucks...for no reason at all
Is it me or does deshaun watson still not look like his old self. Seems slower trying to evade the defense and his long ball is suspect at best at the moment, Cleveland should have won this game..
Browns found another way to loose
I had high hopes for the North, but both those teams just look bad
Our offensive line sucks!  Thank God for defense🙏🏾
Both teams are 🗑️😂
Thats craxy how steelers defense scored more points than their offense hahaha
If Chubb ever plays another game in his life...ill be surprised. Thats a "Boobie" Miles injury.
I hope Chubb recovers soon but until then, jerome ford was moving all night. I loved the stiff arm then the truck 12:53 😂 I need more runs from him
Prayers for Chubb 🙏
Surely not making excuses for the offense. But we have played 2 good defenses to begin the season. Maybe we cant get rolling with against lower tier defenses we will face next two games. Go Steelers!!!
why the hell did the browns for 2 both times they scored a td?
Levi Wallace doesn’t even look like he wanna be out there. Get him off the field
Watson cost them the game. I mean he absolutely stinks. Dude gave away more points than the defense let up.
Two bad teams going at it. Both offenses were anemic.
Its no secret that those two offenses are equally dependent on two things. The Browns have to hope Cooper & Watson can become what Hopkins and Watson were in Houston. + Pittsburgh needs more production in the run game.
Was my first Steelers game and lord the emotions I had in the stadium was different from being at home #SteelersNation
I'm so glad for these highlights.  I fall asleep during commercials, then it's 1am
As a Yinzer, I bleed black and gold and game ball should go to the D.
Is your editor allergic to showing us key moments? Having not seen the game, his is a joke. Two fumbles, and rather than showing us, you show the ref saying there was a fumble. Chubb injury, and instead of showing us what happened, you show him being carted off! Ridiculous - do better
13:44 this play why not just qb sneak 😴
Hey I'm just glad we had some offensive points today. It was a rough start but Pickens had a great day and ya love to see that.
11:31 😂
Deshaun is probably hoping he gets an injury so he can have massage rehab by some immigrant Columbian cougar
Baker Mayfield isn't a great QB, but he is way better than Watson,. Watson is a top 5 worst QB in the NFL,. He's absolutely terrible.  Also, prayers to Nick Chubb (My favorite NFL Player). I feel so bad for that young man.
Chubb was out and they still needed the refs to win
Browns gifted them a game.
I think the ball had oil on it 🤔
Bruh the fact people had garret rated higher than TJ watt as a defensive player is crazy
the worst game i seen as a steelers fan🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ when tf are we going to have a offense??😭😭🤣🤣🤣
The Steelers really need to fire Matt Canada. This sloppy offensive play calling is not cutting it. Our defense saved us tonight.
Prayers to Chubb. Not a browns fan at all but sad as hell to see. He’s always been a beast. Get better brother. Hope this doesn’t end your career.
chubb out 6 to 8 weeks. Browns are screwed
we need a veteran qb🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Watson going to benefit from the Chubb injury. Don’t quote me on that
Thing is the preseason isnt used properly. Used to be 4 games. 2 were for seeing who was who cuts were made snd the second 2 were for getting your starters rwady for week 1. But as well the players take a long time now to gel into a unit the real season starts about week 4. The haves and the have nots get separated. Pittsburgh better get it together or they only place they are going is down the toilet bowl.
Pinkett is a bum for our team he needs to stept up in tht pocket and fire the pill to much running around and holding on to the football, thanks D line for the steppin up.
I support the Ravens and I hate to want to see a better offense from the steelers. Matt Canada's tactics are just inept for this team. Its a shame coz they have a good defense. I like Mike T but even he has to see that
Hope Chubbs be ok thi, but Cleveland losing makes me happy 🤣
America's Bloopers, I would say is the new title for the Browns offense. Watson was hesitating constantly, didn't know where to throw the ball to. The playbook was just not good enough.
Hated to see Chub injured like that so from a Steeler fan to you Brown's fans our prayers are with Chub.
Not having Chubb is massive blow. Hopefully he can come back soon
Pittsburg D won that game.  Amazing.
this game had some weird juju to it.
There's too many 230+ $ million Quarterbacks dropping the ball.......
At least urinatingtree is happy
This league is a joke
Need a quarter back
Not matter what team you root for, it's always sad to see a player get injured. Praying for Nick Chubb and I wish him a speedy and full recovery. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
TY Pit.
CHANGE WILL BECOMING TO THE STEELERS OFFENSE ROOM.. WETHER ITS OC OR PLAYER PERSONEL... WE CANT KEEP PUTTING EVERY GAME ON OUR DEFENSE
I usually don’t watch Pit play, but I got Harris in my Fantasy League. This dude is terrible. Why so much hype!!
Steelers D won The game
Hope you get well soon #24 Chubb. If you didn't go down you definitely would of ran through us for sure. Defense got that tonight... offense let's go man get yall shot together
Cheaters
Watson stinks .  start back up qb , week 3 browns !
All that money for watson. Smh.
That Steelers magic ✨ we call this Pittsburgh bullsh*t football  ugly wins haha
Someone please tell the bozo who picks the cover photo not to give away the result.
Najee Harris is done guys washed
I don't care how my team wins . Just get it done. If we'd have won 35-13 we'd still be 1-1. The offense will get better and when it does Pittsburgh will be a tough team to beat playoff time. Yes, I said playoffs.
Fun game to watch.  Except for Chubb's injury.  Hope he can return .
With Chubb hurt. It over from Cleveland.  See u guys next year
Worst tackling I’ve seen from a Steeler team in a long time.
Who hit the browns helmet with white-out?
One Minute Gameplay, One Minute Advertisement. So innovativ and smart 😒
Cleveland must really be regretting the Watson deal
Finally they show when a star player is injured i hated just seeing a new player in the game and you have to find out somewhere else that a player was injured
本当に悔しい。ブラウンズ頑張れ！
3:27 Nice highlight.
This should be called The Great Fumble Game
armpits lucky they not playing 49ers again
Watson runs way too much.  He aint rg3.  But he could suffer the same fate, unfortunately.
What were the browns thinking paying Watson that huge contract when he didn't pkay a down in 2021 🤯
And Joey porter JR should be starting over Wallace the whole time.
Have been a UGA fan my entire life, and watching Chubb evolve into the player he is now, it breaks my heart to see him go down. I hate the browns, but I still watch them just for him. Wish you the best Chubb 🦇
Отличный матч
Just send back matt Canadá to high school football..so predicable..how in 3rd and goal the ball was not in hands of Warren or Harris...he Made the last season of Ben so average with shorts pases plays......defense won the Game again
So, this is what $230 million contract and loss of 3 first round picks get us. Go Browns! 😭🤢
Fire Canada
Minkah is a dirty player that was 1000% intentional.
Browns uniforms are to clean
Toad QBs are just the suckiest.....
Mediocre bowl.
That was clearly a staged fumble, that guy knew where to pick it up from.  Always said football is just like wrestling a staged entertainment for us cause of the gamblers
First off god speed to nick chubb as Steelers fan that’s tough, second idk how much more clear it can be that Matt Canada needs to leave. As professional sports team how can they not realize that.
The no call at the end is wild lmao
2:30 HOW did he make that throw
As a Steelers Fan: Nick Chubb, get well soon!!! You're a dawg and the best RB in the league for a reason✅
Can't even watch highlights without YouTube forcing 12 ads down my throat
With the way the ball kept popping out and coming lose it is as if someone covered it in massage lotion.
I know it’s early but Kenny is looking horrible under pressure and our oc is so predictable I watch my nephews high school team and they have more complex plays and schemes
What a pity the Browns QB doesn’t throw more often.
Fumblerama...is this College football? Or is sports betting now legal in PA?  Flashes of brilliance mixed with poor fundamentals.  Glad Jimmy G is playing for the Raiders.
The split screen for the N.O. Carolina game has got to go.  Ridiculous.
If Steelers find their run game they will win the division easily with simple run game thoo and Pickett can just be good enough🤞…
Niners smoked the Steelers and Steelers just beat the bengals and niners stomped LA and LA beat Seattle who just beat the Lions !! 😂 game over for everyone except Niners 🤣
I was there, it was fantastic. Tj watt made the place erupt with that recovery/touchdown.
This was a great game so explosive🎉.
Another fun day of Whack-a-Rapist. Browns stink.
Did anyone notice the Browns player just casually pushing over the gatorade lol https://youtu.be/MFvuORB3Llc?si=c-XDZ5Cv8z4FnrRQ&t=803
Hey well at least Watson can decompress from that loss with a nice soothing massage
it won't matter. *THIS IS OUR YEAR* #CowboysNation ⭐👊
Levi Wallace need to be benched
... tonight I watched the worst played football game I have ever seen of following the NFL for 60 years. Absofuckinglutely Lame.    Both teams were horrible.
Pressley Harvin ST🐐🔥🦶🏈
I rather have Madden God at Offensive Coordinator
This game really exposed how basic Mr. Deshaun is!!!!!
Hi ESPN, I know you've had a rough few months, but please get rid of the scoreboard for the other game, it's a really dumb idea
🔥 Tomlin 😂 Jk! He's a winner Deal With It
Nick Chubb dislocated his knee. He probably tore at least three to four knee ligaments (ACL, MCL, LCL, PCL) out for the remainder of the season. I'm praying for a comeback! Its crazy its the same knee he dislocated at Georgia when they played Tennessee (2015)
Tj watt truly is something special
That must've been quite some heart attacks during this game! 😬
When a crowd chants fire matt canada something has to be done, but on the same side, our oline and protection werent great, and kenny was pressured all game with limited decision making. Just like last year......Gunna have to hope for the steelers defense to stay healthy or otherwise its another 9-8 season.
Ooooooohhb yeeaaaaa baby
Speedy recovery Nick Chubb! I'm a Steeler fan but I really enjoy watching you play. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Put the f_____king injury 😡
I was very impressed when riley came trucking in from across the field and knocked down the browns QB while teammates that were on his heels was taking they're time almost like they were giving him a chance to escape
I'm a Steelers fan big time. The Browns are a pretty good team but the Steelers are not playing good smooth football on all three phases on offense, defense and special teams.
Pitt has to replace their QB
CONGRATS ON BOTH TEAMS GREAT GAME AN THE STEELERS CAME OUT TO PLAY STARTED A LITTLE RUSTY BUT NAILED IT AT THE END BOTH SIDES LOOK OK BUT THE RAIN PLAYED A BIG PART IN TODAYS GAME TO AN THE BROWNS WERE DOING GOOD BUT A COUPLE CRITICAL TURNOVERS COST THEM THE GAME HOPEFULLY NEXT WEEK THEY GET ANOTHER WIN OHIO AGAINST EVERYBODY EVEN THOUGH MY TEAM IS THE COWBOYS
Football is such a violent sports. These guys are 200-300lbs running full speed with force trying to hit you. Love the game but hate seeing players get hurt like that. Prayers to Chubbs for a speedy recovery 💪🏽
How bad is Pickett mind Pittsburg defensive was emense won us game but need a qb big style. Watson wasn’t doing any better either
Why do the Browns wear white uniforms
Every highlight was really the other sides low light. What a brutally bad game all around.
Browns did good hope Chubb comes back strong.
Prayers for Chubb!
not often you see two defensive TDs in one game
Too bad for Rub-a-Dub-Dub chub
Watson has to learn how to throw the ball away period he could be completely elite if he does !
The final play is why I don't watch the NFL anymore. I am amazed how many people still do. Blatant pass interference and a no call. Aikman says it's a good no call. Seriously? Pass interference is pass interference. I hate watching fake sports and NFL is the pro wrestling of major sports.
All love for Nick Chubb man, hope we didn’t see the end
Steelers deserve the worst after that hit. Dirty hit. Dirty team. Dirty city. Dirty state. Disgusting all around 😂
MAN WHY THE UNIVERSE GOTTA DO NICK CHUBB LIKE THAT
Steelers defense played great, but the Browns O-line was miserable. Watson was running for his life the whole game. Plus the play-calls for the browns offense does not match the strengths of Watson. When Chubbs went down they needed to open the field up for Watson.
fire canada... RIP CHUBB
I miss Baker
What a THROW!  M 🦘🏏😎
This is the type of game that a star QB wins 👀😂
Yo and if mike tomlin thinks Matt Canada is more than a man playing madden and he cosigns for this trash then I question him defensive scores more than than the offense is classic Matt Canada who thought it was smart to bring this trash bag back and why don't we run the ball
There's more turnovers than a bakery
NO MATTER WHAT I LOVE MY STEELERS ALL THE WAY FROM MS #HEREWEGO #HEREWEGO
Low blow by minkah fitzpatrick thats alright tho just more reasons to hate shitsberg and joke of a fanbase
Nothing like a close game from two bad teams LOL. GJ you made it entertaining.
This feels like the Duck/Mason year all over again…..so far
Browns are cursed to never go 2-0 ever again especially after last years Joe Flacco comeback
If he was a brother, they would send him to another
I'm a Steeler for life but man... our running game the last two years has been incredibly terrible. Not even mid, STRAIGHT last or second to.... that's our issue
The Awareness TJ Watt has is crazy!! DPOTY‼️‼️
Offense by the Steelers need to improve
in the pocket refs
Browns had 198 yards rushing while Canada creating 95 yards... in two games. Team looked unprepared in all parts. Defense save us this. It`s not coaching but individual class. Fire Canada!
Steelers should get rid of matt Canada, coming from an LSU fan 🤭
our offense is terrible 😞
Matt Canada needs to go!! The defense did a great job 👏🏾
They deserved it after Mayfield situation, there no room to forgive, hope they fail big time
The Cleveland CLOWNS ALWAYS SEEM TO FIND A WAY TO LOOSE GAMES that they are  poised to win...I honestly beleive that Jimmie Haslam is & will continue to sabotage the browns team.. Cleveland  have you not gotten tired of LOOSING TO THE PITTSBURG STEELERS & BALTIMORE RAVENS  TWICE A YEAR EVERY YEAR for the past decade???  At some point you have to just PUNCH THE BULLY IN THE FACE so he stops beating on you  Pittsburg has been beatin on you for waaayyyy too long now!!!
#FireMattCanada
The only reason this game was close is because Matt Canada is scared to run the ball. FIRE MATT CANADA‼️‼️‼️
The officials team had a great week! They won every game.
what a joke of a game
Well half the Steelers team won a game. The offense was MIA, again. The O scored one touchdown, wheel the D scored TWO!
What a comedy of errors.
Matt Canada u banned frm the hood bro.
The Browns will go down in history as the team that wasted the most money on ain't sh*t Quaterbacks. 🤨
Steelers do have that headhunting reputation especially at Home when they losing
The Steelers offense needs some serious work, Canada needs fired already and we need to move on with someone better. Another game where the defense wins this game with two touchdowns from a turn over
Get George Pickens a real qb please🤞
3rd & 2 Matt Canada decides to throw it 😑 FIRE MATT CANADA‼️‼️‼️‼️
Steeler fan here. Hate to break it to the nation, but this defense is *not* good. They were opportunistic, turning two Browns mistakes into 14 points. But they also gave up 400+ yards, 200 of them on the ground. Chubb's injury didn't change anything. So this team has serious problems on both sides. Good thing our special teams seems solid, but that's little consolation.
The Browns did everything they could to make sure the average Steelers won. Last week was all you needed to know about them. They played top-tier and didn't get a first down till the end of the 2nd quarter week one.
Matt canada s play calling is like a man playing madden 23 the Steelers are a joke
At least DeShaun Watson lost. There's that.
The Steelers offense wasn't impressive. Good W though. 👍
Chubb is the best running back in the NFL. Get well soon man, from Dallas. Many Cowboys fans have said "If we could only acquire Chubb!"
Dirty city followed by a dirty team
Browns is the Browns 💩
Browns offense is non-existent without Chubb Steelers' offense is non-existent with Canada.
If you’re objective then you’re upset at the missed call against the Steelers on the last throw. “Uncatchable”…yeah, because he was pulled down and away from the ball!
Prayers to Chubb from Steeler Nation
Reality check... the Browns don't need to play a game to lose. They know how to do it all by themselves. Get well soon Nick!
I hear so much Mimimi..a division win is a division win,stop whining around it's pathetic!Go Steelers!
So. Many. Fumbles. 🤦‍♂️
love to see deshaun watson lose baby! and that pick 6 to start the game and a fumble score to choke it away. chefs kiss.
The wave board celebration by Cleveland #44 was so fire 🔥 😭   #HEREWEGO
Cleveland looked like the better team, yet they lost. SMH
Steelers had to destroy a mans leg to win im sick
That Steelers o-line is pathetic
Not a Cleveland fan..but I used to enjoy rooting for them. Always the underdog and the laughing stock of the NFL. All the winless years and endless QB woes..then finally turning it around with Mayfield..wow they turned it around!   Then they trade a bounty for Deshaun "Massage Parlor" Watson last year even after and during his entire ordeal with those assaults. What a scumbag and scumbag organization as far as I'm concerned. I hope Houston makes good use of those picks, but they're tainted, too.   What a joy it was to see Cleveland lose tonight, and I can't wait until they're an irrelevant poverty franchise again. Its a shame too, because they have some great players on that team, I even went to middle school with one of the offensive guards (Bitonio).   Wishing a quick recovery to Nick Chubb, that man is a monster. Too bad those injuries couldn't happen to Watson.
I like the Steelers and I will say this, yo it's unfortunate that Nick Chubb got hurt.  All teams go through injuries, football is a physical sport and I wish Nick Chubb a speedy recovery.    I am a Steelers fan let's go Steelers, the defense was so good late in the game, TJ Watt, Kwon Alexander, Cole Holcomb, Riley, what's up Steelers? First of all my team made some plays down the stretch. To be honest I need my team to start being better on third downs offense and defense.  So many people root against the Steelers it's crazy. I swear if the defense can close out be back the Steelers football they will. Put some respect on Mike Tomlin's name, I was scared of how my team kept giving up first downs on third downs.  Folks thought we were going to lose well guess what? Shut up.    Let's go Steelers the Browns can't beat us , look at our Monday night football record.  1-1 Steelers  Kenny Pickett I trust.
The 20-game home winning streak against the Browns is a really underrated feat. To be that dominant against one team is insane.
Browns uniforms Dope
That's awful for Nick Chubb, get well soon. Gutsy win by the Steelers.
Matt Canada is a joke. College coaches and coordinators don't work in NFL, except for Pete Carroll. Mason Cole can't block nobody. Highsmith and Watt won this game, period.
Matt Canada needs to be fired his offense produce nothing game after game.
Jedrick Willis Jr cost the Browns that game. He gave up on the block that caused the fumble.
If you took off the logos there's no way you could convince me this was an nfl game
The Browns quarterback doesn't know how to throw the ball like a great NFL quarterback.  He made it to the league because he outran and broke down defenses in college with his legs.  If he was accurate like Mike Vick, Donovan McNabb or the older version of Russel Wilson I'd give him a chance to lead the Browns deep into the playoffs.  Now that Nick Chubb is out, possibly for the rest of the year, and maybe his career, Watson's weaknesses will be highlighted and teams will capitalize on them.  I predicted the Browns will go 9-9 this year.  Without Chubb, they'll be lucky to win 7 games.
At least Watson performance was better than Justin fields performance on Sunday!
A Comedy of Errors: 00:03 - 1st play is a Pick 6 01:25 - Interception 01:47 - Missed kick after a sack 02:36 - QB sneak fumble 03:00 - Double fumble 04:23 - RB missed catch 04:36 - Horrible pass 05:18 - 2pt conversion fumble 05:42 - Passed out of bounds  Long pause for a normal game then it starts again: 11:00 - Holding 11:20 - Fumble 11:51 - Porous o-line 12:05 - Missed punt return 12:20 - Blown coverage 12:30 - Fumble sack for a TD 13:19 - Launched pass out of bounds 14:30 - Last possession thrown out of bounds
Ok, so the Brownies come up with yet another way to lose a game.  Sack fumble returned for a TD.  WOW!!
The Atlanta Falcons beat both of these teams already
Lamooooooooo, rip Shitland overhyped rb, bro deserves that for being so over hyped 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Good game by both ball clubs out there 🏈
Browns looking like auburn out there
Sloppy football but Pickens n watt saved us Pickens is looking good he gonna have a big year can we just admit Watson is a 500 qb and average if not worse I’m sick of this dude not getting the same as other qbs who don’t play well
Deshaun Watson lost? Great job Steelers 👍
A Highschool playbook has better plays than the plays send by Matt Canada
Turnoverfest
I have WR Wilson and WR higgens do I trade for WR chase and RB hall?
Well I'm heartbroken Nick Chubb is out for the season so I'm not very happy thanks alot injury-plague as for God I want him putting a shield over the Cleveland Browns and keeping the injury bug away from them for good I'm tired of seeing our best players getting hurt and injured and protection is very important for the Browns if we're going to win the AFC North Division and make the playoffs this season but hopefully we get a win over Tennessee on Sunday
Like I said.  9-8, 11-6 w/a 1 and done, 7-10/6-11.  Then Watson buys out and moves on.  Feel deeply sad for Chubb.  He's a class act all the way.
The browns are cursed....change my mind
Really thought chubb was meant for a 2k season this year
Cleveland oline lost this game
Watson is a useless QB.
As a Steelers fan, first prayers for Nick Chubbs!!! Second, Great team win. Third, Kenny Pickett is not our guy. Just the guy fans are desperate for him to succeed. He literally doesn’t go through his progression, does nothing to show for all his off-season/preseason talk, literally ignores Pickens on drives, no poise in the pocket, etc. I’m for drafting Shadeur Sanders. Bigger arm, more accurate, accepts big moments, has his QB identity, and has poise. Kenny is just like Mitchell Trubrisky.
Horrible result for Chubb. Ford looked good in relief but does Stefanski and the front office give Kareem Hunt a call as insurance? He knows the system. Just a thought.
the steelers look like theyre gonna win 5 games max lol, relied on the defense. you play any of these top teams (like the 9ers) you will get blown out. and they showed that last week. gonna be a rough year for the steeler fans
Is deshaun watson ever gunna show up
warren is better then harris he needs to take his spot
I knew that preseason was too good to be true. I thank Matt Canada for making so jaded over the years that I didn’t believe the hype
lol browns.
Steelers are trash. Lucky the browns brownsed it up
and I was wondering if this game may have been scripted by .,. FRACTURED FAIRY TALES
It will never not be funny how much The Clowns gave up for Deshaun Watson 😂
Browns oline single handly lost the browns the game
The browns had that game if nick Chubb wouldn't have got injured. He's top a 3 RB in the NFL hands down. I hope he gets better soon but good win for the Steelers with their stingy defense 😤🙌💯
Those multiple fumbles at 3:02, the Three Stooges couldn't have done it better. Hilarious 😆
Much respect for Steelers fans as we lost Nick Chubb tonight. Blue collar team, blue collar fans. The best. Thank you Steeler fans.
These divusional games are always tough and could go either way. The Steelers D came up huge tonite and that was the difference. A win is a win..No..1 Steelers fan from Toronto Canada...
Fire Canada
Harris runs out of bounds too much. What good is a power back that avoids contact? I'd trade him.
The results today doesn't matter. Prayers up for Nick Chubb.
Guess dont want to peak too soon....
what a joke!! spend all that time and money to get Watson and he just coughs up the ball
Wow and  thats all im going to say
heck of a game.  great highlights.
As long as the O line doesn’t let him down, Watson will win a lot of games in Cleveland. He still plays with a smart, lethal capability.
Steelers Oline HAS TO GO.
Couldn't have happened to a worse franchise
The Browns should fire Watson. This used to be a fun football team 2 seasons ago..
So many fumbles and turnovers this game lmaooooo
Anytime the Steelers win is good against the Browns absolutely fn great.Baker Mayfield fan happy he's not on this trainwreck anymore.
"Watson runs like a wounded gazelle" -- Tom Grossi 2023.
The real browns showed up- Garrett disappeared, Watson is still dogshit, and they found a way to lose
Nick Chubb injury makes me sick to my stomach and hate football sometimes
Let’s get this straight: Steelers Suck, Browns Suck, Bengals suck more than the Browns. So it’s between Harbugh’s flock or Shitty Mike Tomlin’s Steel for the division???
Worst heart attack game ever.Worst game ever played this season
Here's my idea of what happened in this game we went into the game with the most potent offense in the most post office a defense that we could produce we got into the game and we got cheated from the get-go by Jay Sean Watson who threw a pass and the receiver which he is an and the receiver could not catch the pass and we should not ever throw the bomb this man again he particularly through the game at the beginning ever since that happened the whole game went downhill then we unleashed Nick Chubb on them and they purposely went for Nick chubb's knees and took him out. Now we lost him for the year probably or longer maybe it's careers open over because of what the Steelers did but this is all basically because the Steelers did not want to lose a game like we're going to get beat down again in front of their people so they decided to cheat and cheat and play dirty the whole game so this game was based on dirty play by the Steelers and dirty play going after the knees of everybody on the team and then they want after this round Watson and went after his ankles and hissolar Steelers home game plan was to go after everybody at the knees hit him low take them all out. That's how the Steelers play because they have no offense they have no defense they're just rebuilding and there a sucky team but they had to do the sucking sing and play the lowest game of their life in order to win the game. That's how I seen it but the browns help them every single time they could the browns help them every single time that could end the Steelers know that they can cheat the browns at home and get away with it with those officials because officials will not call any penalties on. You look at the amount of penalties in recalling Pittsburgh compared to Cleveland and the amount of fragrant calls that should have been called that we're all the sudden missed by the officials in this game and you will see that they knew from the get-go that they could cheat their way into this game and win this game by keeping the score clothes and keeping Cleveland from scoring touchdowns by cheating like going low after the players making sure they couldn't go downfield if they caught them off they ran the ball they went directly to the legs it went directly to the legs to the knees this is a big cheating team the Steelers are. I'm not finished with you yet what them yet
Whoever is making these thumbnails needs to be fired
Tenía qué ganar la defensiva. No hay mariscal de campo. Ganó el menos peor
Brown’s talking all that smack last week..lol…steelers put you in check
THE NFL IS THE WORST AN AD EVERY 90 seconds. Literally the worst.
As a jets Fan, Mike Tomlin is the best coach in football,  Better than bellechek,   Bellechek is under .500 without Brady, And Tomlin is over .500 with garbage QBs like Pickett
RIP Chubb. Jerome Ford kinda good though.
Deshaun Watson is a higher paid quaterback than Patrick Mahomes.  Let that sink in for a second.......🤡show forever........
DeShaun Watson is garbage. He is done. Had some great years in Houston but he definitely doesn't have it anymore. It is actually sad watching him play.
A good defensive win. That all it matters. Go STEELERS
You can't win with 3 fumbles and a pick.  This is on D. Watson. 🙏🏾Chubb
alex highsmith is starting to become a real dynamic duo with T.J on opposite sides of the ball and i love it
Gunner is so trash
Looks like lamar is winning this divison lmfao
I think 9 or 10 wins will win the AFC North. This division beats up on each other. It may come down to tiebreakers. The Ravens can have their September AFC North championship.
These teams are trash
Pass interference on number 24 of the defense.  Automatic first down Cleveland!!
i miss ben
Maybe the Steelers could target Pickens more? Good things happen when you hit him in stride
Ugly uniforms, ugly game. don't do that again.
What an ugly game..😂😂😂 both defence takes the grind … offensively I am not hopeful for these 2 teams.😂😂😂
We need a QB… picket ain’t it
Stop the stupid split screen
imagine if cowboys paid amari cooper
Steelers win a crazy thriller of a game highlights against the Browns......👋
those white helmets are sick
It,s so so good ♫♪♫♪
I hope Nick Chubb calls it. Injured the same knee brutally
Did Fitzpatrick get ejected? He should have, that was ridiculous.
Ford looked excellent
Najee harris has not lived up to the hype. I would trade him for another back or tj some help on defense.
W game
I’m afraid if we keep escaping out of stadiums with wins like this, our offensive struggles will not be taken as serious as they should be.
I wonder what the Browns think of their $300 ,000,000 QB now
As an NFL qb why is Watson taking this hit at 9:22 lmao you picked up the 1st down dude just go out of bounds...
These highlight packages are way too long. There are so many unnecessary clips and no replays of good plays. Nobody needs to be spending this much time with Joe Buck on a highlight package. I use to watch 4 games' highlights in 10 minutes now that takes almost an hour, what a joke.
Deshaun Watson lost them that game…
Owners don't want to pay RBs yet the Browns season seems lost without their RB.🤷
Chubb reminds me of prime Bettis. Workhorse power back with an extra speed gear. No love 4 the Browns, but all respect to Mr. Chubb
Dawad Jones couldn't guard a sandwich. No footwork whatsoever. Just being wide as your only attribute isn't good enough.
I like these browns uniforms
can we have baker back....
How much was that guaranteed contract?
BRO STEELERS QB IS TRASH!!!
They need to block Pickett better
Why does Watson look like slow motion. Just retire or be 3rd string if you won't try.
pickett is horrible in pocket
KP is not the guy i rather tank all season and go for Caleb next year KP is not QB material so sad Purdy was there and we didnt pick him, idk if he is a good qb but for sure better than KP
Looks like Pickett had a rough night.  He's still on a learning curve no doubt.
Isn't there a swamp somewhere named 'Okangobee"?  😜😜
Man, even when the Steelers Suck, they  always find away to beat the Browns 😂😅😅
Watson did not look like he was worth $230 million, maybe he needs a massage.
Dirty players. Steelers suck still and also Joey Porter is garbage. Has to hold at the end 😂
Why does Watson look so much slower running now?
Steelers need to draft Shadeur Sanders
TJ WHAAAADDDDDDDDDDDD
Minkah Fitzpatrick in jail yet?
I hope fitzpatrick is okay he didnt look too good on the sideline could be a lung issue. Hope he comes back next week, also need cam heyward and dionte back soon.
Watson thinks he’s fast lol you think he would realize he’s not and get rid of the ball sooner instead of trying to scramble smh
Watson fumbles….is that a bad hand job?
I hate being in this division. Cincinnati, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh are as low-class as it gets, anyways taking cheap shots. Always trying to injure players.
Browns fan — stefanski has got to go. We gifted the Steelers 14 points and if Harrison “stone hands” Bryant makes a catch and we don’t fumble this game is a blowout.
Browns literally threw this game away but I guess that's a testament of the Steelers defense.  Nick Chubb tho... Absolutely heartbroken for my dude. Best wished to the Dawg
Steelers were lucky. They should’ve lost this game.
2x in this game, Watson held onto a defender's facemask and just kept pulling. I get that he isn't the elite player he once was, but why did he have to become such a dirty player as well? He's going to hurt someone and needs to be suspended again
Karma for how y’all did Baker
Baker for Watson! Not impressed!
Prayers for Nick Chubb, one of the best RBs in NFL. I hope it won’t be a big problem for him to comeback.
59 years of futility from the browns...I'm done.
That was the opposite of fundamentally-sound, cleanly-executed professional football. Still fun though.
Yo
Ball must've had grease on it
Deshaun Watson had so many mistakes abd if it wasnt for his fumble Browns would’ve won the game.
Watson is a chump, TJ is a champ 🏆 #firecanada
From a defensive standpoint, couldn’t ask for a better game from our guys but lord this offense is extremely shaky. I don’t trust our O line, don’t trust Harris or Pickens, hopefully they can piece it together for next week!   Also prayers to chubbs on a great recovery & comeback, you were ripping through us tonight with those runs 😂
Nick chubb got knocked out of game.....
Pitt fan here. Our O-line sucks and way too many missed tackles and bad passes from Pickett. Watt can’t save us every game man.
According to the Westwood One radio announcers, the Browns are wearing their 1946 throwback uniforms.
Go Home Watsons!!!
Baker looked pretty good this week.  :)
Gave that one away.
Steelers put a whooping on the browns...
Canada's offense wreaks worst than 3 day old hot dog water.  Can we please move on from him? Regardless, thank goodness for that defense 💪🏿
People are really questioning Watson's contract??😂 Wow...the guy is an out-of-this world talent. Once he gets in rhythm it'll be lights out for the opposition.    Amateur fans...
I'm a Cardinals fan, but I root for the Browns because of Chubb, even tho Baker is not there anymore. Prayers to Nick Chubb.
Says a lot about the Steelers ineptitude on offense when they win the game with that unit on the sidelines. Fortunately, it was balanced out by the devastating pass rush duo of Watt and Highsmith. Just two incredible players.
Must be amazing to watch a game in Pittsburgh.
waiting for deshaun to step up
That was a good game
LET'S GO STEELERS
Fire Matt Canada!!!!😤😤😤
As a Steelers fan im sorry about Nick Chubb, one of the best running backs in the league🙌🏼 hope a speedy recovery🙌🏼🙌🏼 if he would of played all game im sure we would of lost.
Matt canada has got to go..... id love for the steelers to bring back todd Haley
5:17..  good ol Tomlin..  lettin his ego call the plays again, instead of just kickin the extra point..  smh.. 🤦‍♂🤦‍♀🤦
Who says it was an interference call on the last pass? I think it was uncatchable. If that’s a thing..?
Grant Delpit is an absolute stud. Defensive player of the year!
The missed tackles on both teams are ridiculous!!!  The Browns need a smarter quarterback!
Pass interference on the last play obviously everyone was dumbfounded 😂
TJ Watt has out performed Bosa and Garrett in head to head 2 weeks in a row. Can can we please put to rest who is the best edge rusher in the league now?
Ima Falcons fan No dawg in thus fight but I will say the NFL IS SCRIPTED NICK CHUBB INJURY FAKE ITS JUST DIMINISHING THE RB ROLE EVEN MORE Cleveland had the better team but Cleveland is to Pittsburgh what Detroit is to Greenbay no matter the talent
Noticed they didn’t show Tomlin not one time in this clip
Matt Canada has to go!!! You have a running back like a Harris and barely use him. And by the way Pittsburgh needs a quarterback bad!
both teams fumbled so much it felt like a NBA dribbling routine
Nice to see Watson lose. Complete p.o.s.
STEELERS LETS GO!!! 🎉 🙏Get well Chubb speedy recovery 🙏💯
I like both teams as Giants fan but big picture take away GREAT MNF game all around 😀
Just sell the F’in team. I can’t take anymore
Steelers offense in shambles , browns need a better OC
Watson the most over payed player in NFL
STEEL shield can be deployed as powerful weapon!
You get what you overpaid for Browns. "A happy ending" for the AFC north
The Browns always need to beat the refs as well as the Steelers.   They sill sux.
dirty hit by Minkah Fitzpatrick
Both teams looked shitty
It's time people stop cheering for minkah. always trying to get the injury
Pittsburgh has always been a dirty team. They get it from their head Coach.
Can we cut Gunner Olszewski yet please?
Watson is cheeks! Baker is better
GO STEELERS!!! 👏🏈💪
how is watson still playing????
Poor Cleveland......they lose their star RB and almost manage to get the W. Too many stupid mistakes to win.  Pittsburgh really should have held a legit QB tryouts rather than just "giving" the staring job to Pinkett.  Thank god for the Steelers defense that scored 14 points in this game....otherwise, they weren't going to do much and likely would have lost this game.........
The NFL is scripted
So much love for Chubb.. what a beast. He’s the best in the NFL for a reason. Will see him again for sure
The Steelers need to get rid of Matt Canada for poor offensive plays and get rid the defensive coordinator for poor defense plays.
That was a PI on the Steelers at the end! Should’ve been called
CSU- CHEAP SHOT UNIVERSITY!!
Yup these 2 teams won't be going to the Superbowl anytime soon.
Serious question but has there ever been a worse performance by an NFL QB than giving up 14 points single handedly, giving up 30 yards single handedly, throwing as inaccurately as tonight and making the decisions he made? I legitimately think this is the worst NFL performance by a QB in history. He single handedly cost his team the game.
💛🏈🖤
No call on pi??? Fixed😡
We love you Nick, hope you can fully recover 😢
i would just like to point out how main stream media such as the nfl and espn pages hate watson due to the allegations . therefore anything that goes wrong in the offense will be blamed on watson 95% of the time. And when u have a announcer such as joe buck doing exactly  what i just said all the listening viewers hear is how bad watson is without actaully understanding what is happenings. here is what i took away from the game. defense is amazing , play calling needs to improve, and watson needs to have a little better decisions making but that O line did him no favors. Watson threw the ball away many times near the wr because there was no separation with wrs and the pocket was closing in. there people will blame it all on watson even tho thats what you should do when no one is opening and u have 4 sec in the pocket. people will nit pick things in watson but I still have hope for deshaun watson
How did Cleveland beat the Bengals in week one????
Dude this game was WILD!!! Loved it!
Watson one day May really injure player with all the facemask grabbed
Browns fans missing Baker yet?
The NFL should issue disciplinary actions to the referees for missing that pass interference call at the very end of the game but as the Browns if they want to win the AFC North Division and make the playoffs this season they have got to cut down on the penalties and really put it all together but officials need to start doing their job and quit missing calls cuz they missed the facemask penalty against Pittsburgh to that wasn't called
With Chubb at RB , you start game off with Play Action pass instead of spread . Atleast keep defense honest
Kevin stefanski really need to give a Watson physical massage.
Deshaun Watson = Deshone Kizer
14:10 If this was the Patriots no way that would've been a first down.  😂🤣😂
Defense was impressive
Meanwhile, Mayfield has been playing at MVP level and has the Bucs 2-0. I guess there's a reason why bad teams stay bad for a long time.
This has to be the worst Steelers offense of all time also big shoutout to the defense love them they had more points than offense but this can’t be happening each game pls also fire Matt Canada
Great Game, loss of Chubbs is sad, but Ford pushed through.  Steelers Defense won this game putting up 14 points themselves, Steelers Offense :( , however, leaves even more looming questions.
TJ Watt with more career sacks than any Steeler ever. Amazing. Our defense was amazing, our offense made the game interesting....
Defensive player for Pittsburgh number 29 what was wrong with him tonight? He looked lazy tired or doped up or something
Watson is bad bad
Even though Chubb plays for the Browns, I love him as a running back. He brings it every game, and is a force to be reconed with.  I hope for his sake, this injury doesn't spell the end of his career. It's the second major knee injury for him.  He's a baller.
That was a cheap shot on Chubb's knee and no one can tell me any differrent.
Bruh.. cmon browns deserve better Steelers are filled with dirty players. Steelers Defense is still not good.  Kenny is not the guy  I can run faster then Najee  Steelers got a literal cupcake walk of a win.  Nothing special here…
Nice. Can't lose to that P.O.S. Watson.
I'm glad my team won but God please let Nick Chubb recover from that. He doesn't deserve it
I'm wishing the best for Nick Chubb ... But Watson bro you have been mediocre to bad in every game you have played in a orange and brown jersey
They chose these two teams for the second MNF game? For as crazy as Watson’s whole situation was it def seems like they’ve not shied away one bit in supporting and putting him on the main stage. I’d imagine it’s the same concept of why big NBA players get less fouls in the playoffs/finals because they want those highest paid players out in the field (or court) because it brings the numbers. Either way, I get Pittsburg being on an early MNF game but Cleveland? There were a few games yesterday that I would’ve put on tonight’s game vs one of the many Sunday games.
Randy Baumen of DVE, you prediction  of Steelers offense being fine and defense suspect was off 🤣 Your brain was 180 off and think Bill didn’t agree with you on this one, as he mostly does.
Pickett's terrible. I turned on the t.v a few minutes after the game started and this dude already through a pick.😮
One of the worst refing jobs sver
Blow to Nick Chubb's knee looked deliberate to me. Any person with common sense knows what is going to happen when you hit someone in the front of their knee like that. Please suspend and fine the Steelers dirty player. He knew exactly what he was doing
Chubb you the real one if it wasnt for you i would have gotten smacked in fantasy but now i win 153 to 152 also couldve still lost if the panthers score that 2pt conversion to sanders other than mr theilen i miss him SKOL
Steelers own browns 😂
Which 2024 college QB would be a good fit for the Steelers?? Comment!
Deshaun  Watson  might be the first qb ive ever seen with 2 face mask penalties  in the same game
Here's what sucks is why is it not okay to do hi- lo for lineman but it's okay to do hi-lo on a running back?! Minkah Fitzpatrick clearly dove at the feet of nick chubb while he was being brought down by Highsmith!!!
Lets go
TJ Watt is on fire from the first two weeks. He keeps this up, he'll be a two time defensive player of the year.
Simply put, our QB looks afraid out there.
Njoku still injured that’s why he ain’t running if he could boy oh boy
Good ole fashion dirty steelers football unbelievable
Not a fan of both teams but congratulations to the Steelers on the victory win tonight much respect to them
From a Steeler fan, i got so much respect for Nick Chubb. Sending prayers his way. He was dominating this game.
Watt family, missing Piece, QB
To think that the Browns paid the farm for Watson for Mayfield. 😂 There is a reason why bad teams stay bad for a long time.
The Pittsburgh Steelers are 1-1⚫️🟡⚪️ Week 3 at Raiders
Anyone else love the "Fire Canada" chant?
Money well spent on DW! Such a big upgrade over baker! 😂. Tomlin continues to embarrass the browns front office
Mm :(
That Chubb injury reminds me of Willis Mcgahee in college. He came back but he was younger. Hopefully this doesn’t end his career. Sucks man.
This was the best game so far this season. Defenses played ‘lights out’ and offenses were pretty even
Reasons Browns lost  1- we have WRs who can’t separate  2- have a 230 million dollar QB who’s no longer Elite 3- running back room sus outside chubb
Steelers defense is nasty if they get that offense figured out they can go a long way this season
Black and yellow baby!! We did it!! 🖤🤍💛
Two 2XPs--for nothing!
Levi Wallace played terrible this game, hopefully joey P and him can rotate a bit more
Both are bad teams. they will be both playing for last place in the division.
Yup, thats AFC north football for ya..
Those advocating for baker please stop, he had 58 picks in 4 years with Cleveland
Rest up Chubb 🙏
Normally it's wrong to cheer for an injury but for an awful player like Gunner Olszewski that screws up every time he touches the ball, an injury is the best thing that can happen to him since Tomlin would've kept playing him since he's always loyal to a fault to all his players.  Levi Wallace for example was complete trash the past two weeks and he still gets the full time playing time while their stud Joey Porter is on the bench.
Bring back kordell stewart
How the hell did my Steelers win that game, HOW? Also I hope Nick Chubb's knee injury isn't serious and he can get back to the field. That was Brutal!
Cant even say its bc Chubb went out bc the back up did better than Chubb did last week. Cleveland just lost. Pittsburgh did what they had to do. Good game Pittsburgh.
Same old sorry ask Browns!
I can't wait to see utree's rant about this game.
Remember when Watson was a running QB? This is why running QB usually make poor starting QBs when they lose that speed.
Womp Womp Browns
F-ck this game. Ugliest game on both sides, way to many dirty shots by Steelers. Maybe even ended a HOF running back career. Poor officiating as always!
Holding on that last play. Get well soon Chubb
Watson always seems like he is a fumble or interception away from losing the game for you.  Doesn’t seem clutch.
Disgusting game
Great win, sucks that they do better when i dont watch and i bet against them. Prayers for chubb🙏🏻 speed recovery @chubb
Horrible play by Watson > that fumble at the end is atrocious, multiple flags by him ... most overpaid QB  ...clevland def played lights out but the offense let them down
Prayers up for nick chubb and wishing a speedy recovery 🙏
The mvp of the game is watson and hes not even on the steelers giving them 14 free points nice job.
Maximum resolution of 360p and again having the same play appear twice back to back.  The way the NFL runs this channel is a joke.
Shitstankskis fingers all over this one
Deshaun Watson looks awful
Steelers offensive line is hot garbage. Seemed like every other play they were getting pushed backwards.
That’s my boy Watt!!!!!
First off Jerome ford great game second Watson you’re a true disgrace bro 🗑️ ain’t the word 230 for a person that can’t throw accurately for 230 yards DID SOMEONE SAY DTR!! Stephanski needs to take him and his playbook to hell… and next nick chubb bro it feels like something happen to my own brother this is crazy I just hope that you’ll play again even if you sit this year out that’s fine just get back to what you love Cleveland browns legend already#24 🙏 and last the Pittsburgh 🐱 they played so dirty this game it’s not even funny they need to be fined and or suspended from the nfl for what they did to Chubb that was dirty as dirty could be theirs no way we should let this slide as fans
Kenny Pickett is horrible. Let’s be honest — if Mitch Trubisky was out on that field playing exactly the same, the fans would be rioting in the streets. The timer for Kenny to figure it out is running out soon, because this offense has been outright horrific thus far.  Also, just going to predict the Matt Canada clowns coming to the replies on this: Kenny has been missing easy throws throughout both of these games. It’s not Matt’s fault.
Deshaun Watson 230 million Guaranteed after quitting on the Texans who just gave him the $$ extension he wanted. Typical Browns story. Watch Baker have a great year in 2023.
Black and yellow let’s go
Big dubs prayers for Minkah and Chubb 🙏🏽🖤💛
wow, what a sloppy mess....
Not happy about this win as a steelers fan. Ugly win lots to work on but it's still a dub
BROWNS VS REFS
I’m so sad chubbs is done
how the hell the ref did not call pass interference by porter when the ref was literally in front. gambling ruined today's sport
W STEELERS
Steeler fan here, I sure hope the draft a QB next year.
Watts night
Can Matt Canada still be fired please? Can’t expect our defense to always bail out this absolutely pathetic offense
Watt looked tired AF in the 4th😂
Fire Canada!
We won but only because the linebackers carried the team on there back and our offense looked … I don’t even know what that was
Should have kept Baker m Watson sucks
Browns WRs ranked last in terms of separation last year, heard commentary mention no one can get open still lol. Also 230 million dollars your QB play gotta be better
If the Steelers had an offense this would of been a blow out
So sad to see any player get hurt  especially a great one get well Minka and yeah Nick chubb too..the browns game plan was to attack Levi wallce all night and it almost worked . Matt cannada needs to stop calling plays he sucks and the interior of the Steelers online is in shambles specifically 73 and cole 61 awful again . Wow did the pre season lie . Nick chub thoughts and prayers get well and come back strong. I'm Steelers fan but I'd lie if I said I didn't love watching him play ..I hear he's a class act off the field too
Totally embarrassed by the Browns offense.  The O-line is horrible and Watson's turnovers are demoralizing.
Okayyyy Joey Porter Jr. he played pretty well when he was out there
Matt Canada is terrible
3:00 21 is getting yelled at for that if they lost.  Screwing up a possible TD drive just to taunt.
Minkah’s motor to save that Ford touchdown!
Video wont play for me
I just noticed that Pittsburgh teams are all black and yellow: Steelers, Pirates, Penguins.
I very much dislike Pittsburgh very very much if I could have the infinity gauntlet I'd snap 🫰 them out of existence absolutely sucks what happened to Chubb
These QBs are both terrible.  The difference is, one was paid .25 Billion and the other is on a rookie contract.
I can't believe I woke up a 2am to watch the Browns do that... This team just finds new and better ways to hurt me in every conceivable way possible.  I hope Chubb is okay and get better, prayers to Nick
fire canada.
Please fire Matt Canada
Thank god for our defense. Offense has a lot of work to do.
Whoever edited these highlights missed big plays, the fumble recovery of Pittsburgh and the injury to chubbs. Wtf!
Video not playing 👎👎👎👎👎
Love Nick Chubb.  So humble and the best RB in the league.  My thoughts are with him.
This game sucked.
Cleveland came to Pittsburgh wanting to be physical. They have two buses headed to Cleveland one with guys that are hurt and the other guys that won’t be returning for a while. AFC North football.
*Everyone came here looking to see the Chubb Injury!!!*
AFC North got the best kickers
Feeling for Chubb, man 🙏
Our defense is great, but offense is just trash. Kenny's throws are just off. I know he is under Canada but still, if you can't throw a decent ball on a slant route...
POST IT WHEN HD FINALIZES
Fire Matt Canada into the sun.
The Ravens might have the pierces to finally be that dominant score controlling team that they’ve destined to be🦅
Chubb’s injury reminds me of Willis McGahee when he broke his leg against Ohio St.
Here before 1080p🎉
Wishing Chubb a speedy recovery ❤
Thanks for not working
Cleveland Ohio Cleveland teams Cleveland fans were getting too confident we needed this loss with Pittsburgh which I'm happy about because it brings Cleveland back to where they belong scrubs
Way to go Steelers what a physical game you displayed. Myles Garrett who? TJ Watt again outperformed him by miles. There is no comparison in these two. Steeler nation.
14:15 what a play by Riley
Just like the Browns' uniforms, this video quality is a real throwback!
Cleveland Ohio Cleveland teams Cleveland fans were getting too confident we needed this loss with Pittsburgh which I'm happy about because it brings Cleveland back to where they belong scrubs
As a Browns fan I'm beyond ticked. You couldn't ask anymore for our defense. Not ONE play in the redzone. Our defense gave up 9 points but our offense gave up 17! Our quarter billion dollar qb looked awful, we can't secure a ball, and we *Lost the heart and SOUL of our city in Nick Chubb from a completely dirty hit!* Don't care what anyone SAYS! Fitzpatrick went low and led a shot on a planted leg. He knew better. Screw the game, screw our awful qb play. They NEED to be looked at. *That Chubb injury has me seething!*
you released the video too early you gotta wait until HD is finished processing to publish I just watched this in 360p
Pls fire Matt Canada thank you
I feel so bad for Nick Chubb, man. Worst injury I've ever seen for a RB.  He's always been a class act and lethal on the football field. I hope his career didn't end tonight.
Prayers for Chubb's quick recovery. One of he most humble guy in the league. He doesn't deserve this.🙏❤
... Big Steelers' Game-Ball to Watson. Carried the Steel-City tonight...
Prayers for nick chubb recovery 😢
RIP Nick Chubb 😢
Honestly, I think it's time to start discussing how terrible that Deshaun Watson contract is. 230 million guaranteed and he's not even playing remotely up to that.
*For a moment I thought the Steeler's Offense was auditioning for the Globe Trotters LMAO!!! 🤣 *
As a Steelers fan and University of Georgia alumni. this was a bittersweet win. Man, I feel horrible for Nick Chubb. I saw him and talked to him once on UG campus and he was such a humble and nice guy. My thoughts and prayers for Nick Chubb! Get well soon and comeback stronger, Nick!
I guess Pittsburgh will always be a defensive team. Great j0b to the defense for sealing the game!
I'm done being a browns fan.... I hate to be a bandwagoner but after 20 years of being disappointed, I'm done letting my girl cheat on me, I'm finding a new ho....  P.S. If I am going to still be a browns fan.....PLEASE FIRE KEVIN STEFANSKI!!!!! He's trash at play calling and that's being nice!!
This was like the Demar Hamlin situation, after Chubb went down, the game didn’t seem that important. Was Baker Mayfield really that bad, Watson is just not that good.
A fumble for 6. Im officially done with sports betting for a while!!! I havent been this pissed off in a min! Unreal. 60 day ban!!! See ya
That hit by D Ward was crazy
Prayers go up for Chubb.
Prayers to Chubbs for a speedy recovery. 🖤💛
glad we got W, quieted you clowns up
What's a offense?
How was that not holding on the Steelers on browns last possession…. Y’all cheat
Well, our defense played well tonight but offensively we struggled against the Browns all game long. I hope it was apparent to everyone watching this game tonight that Matt Canada needs to be fired. We're never going to win a championship with Matt Canada as our offensive coordinator. I'm glad we won tonight, but we need to rectify our offense.
I WAS F ING WAITING, WHAT A PRIMETIME GAME!!!!! HERE WE MFIN GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO😤😤😤😤😤😤‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️⚡⚡⚡⚡🟡🔴🔵
Browns season is over with no Chubb. That’s their entire offense
the refs are sooo stupid
What did I even watch?
The Steelers are apparently never going to lose a MNF home game ever again.  Last time it happened- October 1991
Minkah Fitzpatrick #39 went low and leg hunting.  Too many injuries by this technique.  NFL should ban it.  That's not a tackle.
Hope all injured are okay and get better. Chubb/ Minkah Fitzpatrick. Steelers play calling/ offensive performance must get better. And steelers can get better. I just hope Steelers can stay healthy, and for the injured get back healthy and stay that way. Get well soon to all the injured guys. Prayers and all are needed.
as a Steelers fan.. this is the most disappointed I have been in a win🙄
Never wear those white helmets ever again. They are most definitely unlucky.
#Herewegosteelers
The biggest definition of defense wins games. Heart goes out to chubb. Tough game all around.
Crazy to see one team's season end just after Week 1 started (Jets) and now we see another team's season end in Week 2.  Cleveland is paying a Jacoby Brissett-type QB $230 million, Chubb is gone for the year and that offense looks very 1985.  Stefanski will be gone at year's end (if not before), and it's another Browns rebuild.  Just cursed.
I WILL GLADLY PACK MATT CANADAS BAGS AND MOVE HIM OUT OF PITTSBURGH FOR FREE !!!!
...what's with the 360p videos? Is this 2004?
Nick Chubb going down HURTS to see man. From a rams fan, I’ve always been a fan of Chubb. Runs hard and reminds of rb’s from the 90’s and early 2000’s.
Quick thoughts before I ramble about Matt Canada  1. Prayers for Nick Chubb. That was a brutal injury he suffered 🙏🙏  2. This game was an injury bowl  3. TJ Watt, congratulations on both becoming the Steelers all time sack leader and for scoring the game-winning defensive TD  4. Defense, outside of Levi Wallace, played great tonight  5. Outside of some Pickett to Pickens magic, Kenny Pickett looked real inconsistent tonight. I'm hoping he'll get better in the coming weeks.  6. O-line seriously needs a ton of help.  7. This game alone is proof as to why the ball has to be thrown to George Pickens.  8. Run game largely non-existent. Again.  9. Cut Gunner Olszewski already.  That's it.
TJ Watt and the Steelers defense saved them tonight. As for Browns, the Nick Chubb injury is devastating he’s their entire offense and without him Browns are gonna need Watson to play so so much better than he has for them in 8 games because he looks awful since coming back from the suspension.
The Steelers have now won twenty one straight Monday Night Football home games. Wow!
It’s time for people to stop giving Watson a pass for his poor play. He’s been even worse than Russell Wilson in Denver.
Steelers deserve this win🔥🔥🔥. I hope you feel better Chubbs get well:)
My god the Steelers have got to rid of Matt Canada….just imagine how unstoppable they would be with a consistent offensive coordinator.
Nick Chubb gets injured AND that was one of the most incompetent games I've ever seen...it was giving Broncos/Colts from last year  a run for the money at times.
It’s good to know that no matter how “good” the Browns are, they will always be owned by the Steelers.   In all seriousness, prayers for Chubb and Fitzpatrick
Pittsburgh loses if chubb doesn't get hurt
Fire Matt Canada
Totally rigged for the refs..  Honestly this refs were in the side of the steelers whole game.  Praying for Chubb and his recovery 🙏🙏
So many injuries hope they all feel better especially Nick Chubb but this was a fun game to watch on a Monday both teams goin back and forth !
I am a former athlete who is trying to grow on YouTube. Ive been transitioning to bodybuilding and I am currently 11 days away from my first competition!!! 🎉 if y’all see this and wouldn’t mind subscribing that would mean the world to my journey.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 For Nick Chubb praying for a full recovery.
As a Seahawk I watch the Browns games because of Chubb, hope he gets well asap!
Praying for Chubb. Terrible injury.
Such a silly game
WE DONT DESERVE TJ OR HIGHSMITH. START THE CHAIN PLEASE
no surprise the nfl tryin to go against watson, telling refs to make bias calls, find me a female masseuse that hasnt had incidents with male customers #happyendingsarentillegal
Dude the crowd noise is so ridiculous in pittsburgh lol.
FIRE MATT CANADA PLEASE 🟡⚫️🟡⚫️🟡
Steelers Baby Birds :) Let's go
What a ugly win but I’m happy 🖤💛💪🏾💪🏾
Watson couldn’t finish a game even if he was guaranteed a happy ending massage.
Classic Tomlin MNF performance. A win is a win.
Prayers for chubb 🙏🙏🙏
The Steelers seriously need to fire the Offensive coordinator
a pick 6 on the first play of the game is crazy
Pray for chubb but can gunnar be cut mans selling so hard
This was a great defensive game, an injury filled game to say the least. The Browns losing Chubb now for the season is a bummer, but they have Jerome Ford to fill the void. Alex Highsmith got this one started with a pick-6, and then the scoop and score by T.J Watt to seal the deal. It’s all about grinding it out until the end when you play in these rivalry games
FIRE MATT CANADA!!!
12:16
watson is the problem
The fact we had to win this game by having 2 Defensive TD’s should say something. I’ll take it tho.
Porter really stepped up
I swear Pittsburgh could dominate if they put up at least 30 points a game but matt canada isn't open to that idea
Most normal Steelers game
No matter what you do Cleveland, you just can't win against the mighty Steelers!!!
*Steelers will end up winning the AFC North ! Book it !!*
Let's goo!!STEELERNATION!! offense needs some work but the defense won it for us it was ugly but it was a win
This game shows why running backs are still important especially star running backs 💯
Praying for Chubb and his recovery 🙏🙏
Nick Chubb is my favorite RB. Getter better bro.
Prayers for Chubb man
Watson went from groping in the spa to groping facemasks.
Defense wins games fr
Nick Chubb’s injury reminded me of Navorro Bowman’s injury a decade ago.  I pray he recovers.🙏🏾
Browns is the Browns
Browns season over
If Chubb didn't get hurt, we had this game. Prayers for Chubb, injuries suck
TJ > bosa
Sixth!
Steelers defense 14 - Matt Canada offense 12.. bailed out by defense and his job survives another week for no reason
The Steelers were able to paint the Browns black after having their faces melted off their skulls by the 49ers.
NFL re uploaded 😂
0-16 CLEVELAND BROWNS HEARTBROKEN 💔 😭
Second time it posted
first
How the hell is Gunner Olszewski still on a 53 man roster?? Unbelievable
*If you ask me, Baker Mayfield will enjoy his best revenge this year by reaching the playoffs while Deshaun Watson misses the playoffs.*        (Also we gonna whoop the brownies week 6)
Steelers need to fire canada bro😐
Watson’s gonna need a massage after this one.
Get well soon Nick Chubb
1st
There are three constants in life:   death  taxes      pittsburgh getting bailed out by high end talent
fith lol
*Typical nail bitter and Typical comments after WHY won't they get rid of Canada??? Does he have some dirt on someone high up!!! I mean what's it gonna take!!! And I'm tired of being known as the team that keeps it's coaches until they get Social Security LMAO 🤣*
;)
Great game :)
Prayers for chubb
Cleveland Browns vs Pittsburgh Steelers
First
FIRST!
Go steelers
