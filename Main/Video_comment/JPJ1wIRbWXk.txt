If this channel is sponsored by Vittoria now, you HAVE TO show the video clip of Bonifazio descending with Vittoria tyres in Milan-SanRemo 2019!
Nella lingua italiana..... Niente da fare vero?
S-works (disc brake) vs Bianchi (Rim brake) amazing match.😁
Trek didn't attack on the cipressa but   loic vliegen did but overall a good representation of the race
the bianchi from 2016 is killing it these days lol

It’s 2020 why is this only in 1080p? looks like you filmed it on an old iPhone
As dr would say, “everyone loves a good rim job”.
This 2min highlight felt like you watched the whole race but on amphetamine.
Thanks for the highlights Vittoria. They are much appreciated.  Van Aouert is blowing my mind, as well as he's blowing the wheels off the peleton at the moment.
Rim brakes!
What a terrible highlight. Geez.
rim brake ftw
I love how white hot WVA is right now 🔥🔥🔥
Rim brakes are fractionally more aero than disc.  And not to take anything away from the skills of the riders, but the rim brake bike was fractionally ahead of the disc brake bike at the finish line...
Gotta give credit where it is due: these highlights weren’t bad. A bit short though...
Wout has arrived fully, no longer an exciting prospect. Clearly one of the handful of best riders in the world. We’ll see how he is used at TDF, but I hope they go for a green jersey, no reason at all he can’t win it.
Yes!  Wout!
