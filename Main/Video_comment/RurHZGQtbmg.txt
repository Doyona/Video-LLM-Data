Come on then - if you could only have ONE of these, which would it be? VOTE in the COMMENTS on this post!
Ferrusio just turned in his grave 🤧
I never knew porsche was this good 😮
Rarri still
7:02 Ferrari jumped the start and nearly got the same start as the first race
Just looking back at this 5 years later just brings be back
Svj lamborghini all day
"We all know what the Porsche is about." I felt that.
That Ferrari must be a cheaper one, with the steering wheel on the wrong side. Manufacturing or factory defect?  (joke, its beatiful!)
superfast? more like superslow...
Porsche says FLAT & they're talking about competition
...Porsche, just here to keep you Italians honest... 🧐
Would be awesome to see in a drag race a Ferrari 812 competizione
Turbo s all day
Porsche is stock what???
English comes from the German Language
Porsche!
now race them on a track
Porsche is still the best❤
lamborghini and ferrari sound is perfect and good but porsche no sound and not so fast
12:07 superfast 812❤❤❤
Ferrari, definitely.
lame comment, I know, but I wished the Porsche were perhaps some 20cm longer giving it a slightly longer wheel base. It just looks a tad too short, or the wheels just not quite far apart enough. Reminds me of the old short wheel based Audi Sport Quattro SWB. Just the wheel base bit.
812 all day long no questions asked. If I buy one of these it will be Ferrari
Porsche is the best car in the World
LIKE YOU SAID......DEFINITELY PORSCHE!!!!
Lamborghini❤❤❤❤❤
stfu
PORSCHE, except no substitute. (from a life long 911 owner).😎
Porche smoking
La Porsche 911 Turbo S est la meilleure des voitures. Je confirme à 101 %
Idc what y'all say since I was a baby I loved Lamborghini But now I've grown into trackhawk-Dodge Hellcats Ferrari's But if I could choose I choose Lamborghini
1.Porsche 2.812 superfast  3.SVJ  That Porsche was cooking
If I could buy all three and own all three together! Running services etc etc I’d own 3 Porsche over those cars! I know those cars are brilliant but I just love Porsche
Porsche all day every day
Porsche 🥰
I cant stand the poor reliability of these. 400k cars and constant problems. You'd think all that money deep and it would at least prevent a tpms issue
Ferrari babe!
The only good thing about that Ferrari is its sound.
6:05 7:48 8:03
Porsche
Why you speak like "badabapuppi"?
Porsche sweet
Porsche 🎉 faster silent and better price 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Lamborghini is just weight no performance 😂
The Porsche Engineers Exactly Knew What They Were Doing !
Lambo looks cringe Porsche is the jack of all trades just my big loud opinion tho!
What do you think of the fact that the Porsche costs a lot less than the other two, yet it is by far the fastest ?
Yianni jumped by about a month!
Lamborghini + Yanni = Lamboyanni
Just get urself a Porsche
812 👑
superslow
As a daily driver, always the Porsche! 💪
19 times Lemans winning PORSCHE!! Not just NOISE!,not just horsepower, not just weight..but a little bit if it all!  Smallest engine, best priced car, lightest car of the three! Porsche engineering!
crazy how Porsche won with a 6 cylinder imagine Porsche had a v12
Ferrari is the better looking
Je choisis Lamborghini Aventador svj
Porsche sounds the best
Porsche again and again for end this planet hahahaahahahaha xDDDD
soundcheck has the Lambo won
Ferrari
I WOULD HAVE A  PORSCHE 911 TURBO S
the turbo s all day long
Yanny trying to cheat... every time.. such a bad loser
never underestimate porsche
nobody watched the Porsche hahaha
Can you do Drag race Between Porsche 911 Turbo S and Lamborghini Revuelto. Chances are its going to be neck & neck.
Porsche any day, twice on a Sunday!
The porsche sounded the best in my opinion :)
That’s why you never underestimate the quiet small kid ❤
Porsche just don’t care horses and bulls 😂😂
lamborghini 🥰
Lamborghini your the best
an svj costs 700k-900k now lawl
Porshe is the ugly clever guy at school
My fafarit  car was the porsch  and when you say you dont kare abaut the porsch  you are stupid
Porsche 😍
Porsche ✌️
porsche is the best car ever made. cry cry ferrari and lambo
For those who don't know. Facts: Lamborghini Aventador SVJ    | 6:44.97 min| 2018              | Marco Mapelli      | | Porsche 911 GT2 RS   | 6:43.30 min | 2021              | Lars Kern. GT2 RS is the  fastest between these two, but the Mercedes-AMG One currently holds the fastest production car lap record on the Nürburgring Nordschleife with a time of 6:29.090. This record was set in October 2024
Porsche
12:04 porche is better looking and faster
What about 911's pilot? Roury?
12:10 Lamborghini svj ❤ forever
Lambo sounds more brutal but ferrari sounds more smooth revving and more well tuned if Iam not wrong
The fact : That girl Weared Headphones for the SVJ loudness💀
Best car it's Lamborghini Aventador svj
911 Turbo S all day
Best sound : lembo ... Wish we had a pagani
whoever's driving the porsche should be driving the ferrari and the lambo too.
Might as well just turn CW into a 100 percent Porsche channel since Porsche really has no true competitors.  Porsche makes all other cars their bitch.
Yanni…?…boy looks like a MANIAC !!! Truly dangerous…..😮😲🥺
Svj
Porsche fan bois Assemble  | \/
Vs a huracan ???  The turbo S smokes aventadors , astons ,ferraris in a 1/4 m for 1/3 the price. It took the Italians a couple of years and some hybrids before they could catch up and start beating the 992.
Damn that 992 911 turbo S beautiful ❤️
Imagine 812 with four wheel drive😂
The Lambo for sound and Looks, and that Porsche is damn pretty and fast too, the ferrari doesn't do it for me.
Ferrari sounds best❤
Porsche did some black magic with that 911 turbo s
good job, but still im with ferrari
Lamborghini  aventador v12 svj
YES THE PORSCHE WINS  HAHAHA
The Porsche always sounds the best #1 porsche
U dont want the fastest if you really rich
Schnitzel vs lasagne.  Half the price for good meat vs the butchers scrap with some shit who grows in the ditches
These supercars are beasts on the track. The 812's V12 likely loses to the turbocharged beasts, but let's see the results in this thrilling drag race!
812 is my favorite Ferrari
812 ALL DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Six day Benar
SVJ cant be compared to the normal 812, u gotta get the competitione for a fair race. ( Even if the 812 Competitione surel wins)
Once again, Lambo is the slowest
The Porsche is crazy quick!! 🔥🔥🔥
The SVJ sounds the best
SVJ jumped the start😂
Ferrari is still the one you go for if you have class
Porsche is best ever
the ferrari and the lambo
Lamborghini aventador svj
I'd take the Lambo... then I'd sell it and buy the porsche. Then use the extra money to build a fiber body like the ferrari and just snap it on.
Ferrari 812 super fast ❤ Porsche 911 turbo s ❤ No other car is in this video
Lambo is off the charts
Funny enough if the new Corvette were in this race, it would’ve beaten everything 😂
This video is all about porsche proving they don't need 12 cylinders
Imagine a porsche which has the budget of the svj
💯🔥🎉
Ferrari is the best looking, Porsche is the best to own, lampo looks like a chines gadget 😂
Lamborhini aventador svj
Ferrari the best
You don't gotta scream to prove a point. Ironically, it's the German than wins 😂
Porsche all day long 😊
Get rid of yanni
Yanni all the excuses when he loses.
Yanni ditch your shit box lambos and audis
Yanni ditch your shit box lambos and audis
Yanni the king clown and has the shirt to match
Lambo has the bull emblem cause it's bullshit and poormans ferrari
Guy with the Ferrari can’t drive
Super fast just for the sound 😅😅😅🙌🏿🙌🏿🙌🏿
You do know that’s an unfair race. You got two Italian against one German, C’mon 😅😅😅
Porsche 911 turbo s for ever
ferrari f80 is a total fail in terms of design and sound. The lambo and 812 V12 sound infinitely better. May as well get a 911 TTS for the 6 cylinder power and save over a million dollars
Porsche
Porshe is a way better car, half the cylinders and just so much quicker off the line and equal in the rolling race
How didn't you defeat a turbo s with a 812 superfast?
I usually just fast forward to the stats and the drag race. Listening to the waffle has gotten boring..
Der Ferrarifahrer, was für ein Hampelmann!!!
Me in these moment: go ferrari go😂 ( i'm italian)
Ferrari/Porsche/Bmw ❤
Porsche 911 Turbo S for me thank you.
No substitute
911 turbo s 🔥
Porsche all the way💪💪
Salute 🫡 Porsche
Great race, I love em all. But the Porsche so quiet and humble but man is it a beast or the quiet assassin?
THAT PORSCHE!!!  😳😲🤯🏆
The porsche defeats them in quarter mile, and is almost neck to neck at higher speeds too, its top speed is 330kmph, while ferrari has 340kmph and lambo around 355kmph.
❤Porsch❤ all day long
Porche 911 S
Get bro out that Rarri. What is he doing? SMFH.
German engineering 😈
Porsche!
The turbo S isn’t even in the competitions. All the other cars are competing for second place always. Lol
The Ferrari is the Underdog here if we are being honest.. It's got rear wheel drive and still held down the Lambo.. Imagine what it'll do with AWD.. Rari for life!
Porsche. Dayum. Looks? Fk8r also looks better! Lol
🇩🇪👌🤷‍♂️
Yianni is the funniest. The head lean was just AWESOME!
Nah porsche this shit aint funny come on u underatted as shit
마력이 낮은 순서대로 이기네 ㅋ 다 뻥마력
Ts is the most corny comment section I’ve ever seen. Porsche glazing at its finest
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
here we go. Its 2025 and porsche still winning every race

Intro😂😂😂.
You can do all the challenges you want, but Ferrari remains the dream car
WHO Cares of the Porsche is a Little Bit fastet!!! The Sound ande the Rest of the Ferrari ist 1000 Times better
Of course it'll never happen but I'd take the one once called the "hole shot king"!  Hint: it begins with the letter Porsche.
Porsche didn’t realize there were other cars
This is just a pure humiliation for the Italians 😂.
Really don't like yanni only wants to win and don't admit it when he loses. Understanding no one likes to lose but its is what it is. What a sore loser
Not sure what all these comments are about…  They’re all 10 second cars. The 812 looks better imo
PORSCHE 911 TURBO S
Porsche for the overall win 🎉
Italian for show but German for the dough.
Porsche 911 Turbo S all day mate.
Who drove the Porsche, you ego-maniacs?
Wow, what an epic showdown! The SVJ's raw power vs. the 812's elegance vs. the 911's precision—each is a masterpiece in its own way. Who do you think truly owned the strip?
Lambo lost the time Yianny didn't jump the gun.
Porshe aura
svj is way better
That little gray thing showed all of you flames
911!
on paper, WHY is that lambo slower than the 911. 130hp more, and 100kg less… typical italians. can’t do anything right
Greetings from Germany ❤
Yooo I’m from Cardiff and I live in Cardiff yOOOO YOOO!!!
frarri
Porsche and it’s not even close!  Porsche has and will always be superior to both Ferrari and Lamborghini.
If I had a choice of all 3 id have the lambo, because its an svj. If i had a choice without money or rarity being a factor id have the ferrari.  The porsche is built better for a race. But the ferrari is incredible. Its front engine, N/A V12, RWD... these things are disadvantages when it comes to certain races. But advantages when it come to the look, sound, and driving experience. The 812 wasnt built to win races, they jave many other ferraris that have more racing pedigree. The fact that it is as competitive as it is with all the disadvantages they have built into that platform is what makes it incredible. And driving that on the back roads, canyon carving, I will bet it will feel the most fun.  A 1/10 sec on the track is all well and good, but untill youre on a track youll never be able to see that difference. The Ferrari is a gt cruiser.... and to me, it looks and sounds the best. Its the ultimate car, and absolutely the one Id want more than almost anything money can buy.
I'd have the 812.
Not so super fast enough for the win yo
Let’s focus on the performance stats and engineering marvels here—each car is a masterpiece in its own right. Which one do you think truly shines in a drag race?
No hesitation  PORSCHE   Not all about hp
Gt3 is just a reference point to see how good other cars are XD
German Cars 🤤
It's always the quiet one in the room
your Italian accent sucks dude 😀
Porsche always being Porsche
812 all day
Porsche
5:32 sound beginning soo good and boasting lot power and black but Porsche no sound like Tesla
I always loved more Lambo compared to Ferrari, but that 812 is just 🤩😍
CMON… CMON.. GET FRUU 😂😂😂
Without thinking, I chose Porsche.
Porsche 911 is the best even if had the money I  would buy a porch.. value for money.
Ill rather have the 812 instead of the svj its just better
ferrari was better
812 all day. That car is beautiful 🌹😍
THAT PORSCHE ALSO IS A VERY RELIABLE CAR, I'VE GOT TWO FRIENDS WHO USE THEM AS DAILY.DRIVERS!! ENGINEERING IS INCREDIBLE WITH THEM..
Only from a dig tho
SUPERFAST 812 DAILY
The Porsche driver is going to pick up the kids and grocery run, while the Ferrari is going in for a full tear-down and rebuild.
Matt's really great with his accents 😂😂
Porsche or nothing.
Porsche e porsche
The Ferrari Super fast is such a gorgeous car 🤩
And they say Porsche doesn’t  build super cars! Lol FOH!
Why do they silence the Porsche?
11:38 she s beautiful😍
Why does this guy ALWAYS try to be funny when he nearly ALWAYS sounds like a total div?!    And he always has his ... Chum "yaaaaaani" with him!
The Ferrari and then I would sell it and get the Porsche 😂 make some easy money!!
"And the lambo did really well against the porsche" shut up nerd with ur half million dollar car that can't beat porsche
Now you tell me who the winner is. Haha
Ferrari
2 v12 a levar pau de um 911!
sound of porsche is very smooth. That's why i like it a lot
i would pick all 3 😂
que baje de peso yani
When you are so goated that when you do drag race then opponents are fighting for 2nd place ....... Porsche 😅
Ferrari f12
The Porsche 911 Turbo S is the ultimate automobile.  It is classy looking, civilized enough to use as a daily driver,  is as fast or faster than cars costing nearly twice as much, brakes extremely well, and handles well without beating you up.  It's true supercar, disguised as a daily driver.  If only I could afford one.
Porsche is fastest and best looking lol
About to hit 10 million sonnnn
Proof to German car is the best
5:21 is when it starts 🥱
5 and a half minutes in and no race… unsubscribed
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
6:50 😅
Porsche.
Porsche.
Porsche rocket🚀
Just see the video. What a great start moderation Mat! Very talented Also as a comedian 🙌🏻👌🏻😂😂😂
Porsche 911 turbo S, all😮 wheel drive, DCT (means u could never beat me)
The Ferrari sounds better
The best sound is Lamborghini svj
The porsche has the least bhp and torque and weighs more than the lambo...how
That Turbo S is a marvel of technology. But for something so fast in a straight line without sound - might as well get a Lucid Sapphire Air...?
Ferrari for sure
Mate that Porsche... 🥵
I like to Ferrari
I would have the Porsche
Porsche
Turbo S and it's not even close.  The only daily driver supercar.
Porsche is just a cameracar 😂
I can accept the fact that this is techniqally 2 volkswagens vs a ferrari
I'd have the Ferrari for sure
Ferrari.
The Porsche all day long.
Porsche
Its between the turboS and the 812 superfast
Best intro ever.
I would have the Lambo, sell it and buy a Turbo S and a Mercedes S63 with the proceeds
Something else the Porsche Turbo 😂
Porsche 🚀
Yea , sure “650hp”
Ferrari all day ... everyday
I love that Lambo but....the Porsche.
Im sure that porsche has around 640 hp on the wheels
Just 911 turbo
Yanni telling he won. Forgot the Porsche tho.
@carwow can you do a compilation of the best sound checks?
Ferrari 812 looks better
ther rari for sure
4 years after the debut of this video and the less expensive Porsche is still desecrating the competition.
SVJ
Wait for the gintani twin turbo svj💀💀💀
5:23 LAMBO JUMP !
i would like to have an aventador sv
This is not a fair race because that isnt 911turbo competitior ; with 100 Hp more on Porsche would beat them from 50 mph in sport
812 no question
SVJ all day, any day ❤
Ferrari vs Audis
That yanni bloke sits, drives and looks like an oaf. 😂😂😂
Porsche for me all day, but Ferrari has class man. Not a lambo fan whatsoever lol. To each his own though.
Lamborghini să câștige la sigur
Okay the grey thing i want that one 😍
Звук Ферарри 👍
❤YEAH!! AGAIN SUPER CARS ❤ 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇
Porsche for Sure
They are ignoring the porsche 😅
Of course Lamborghini no doubt about it
Where is my Bugatti?
The porsche give the a surprise they will never forget in history. Its not by mouth is by doings
Those cars are noisy 😱🥶😶‍🌫️
German technology speaks for itself.
Turbo S is the best all around car in history. Change my mind
"oh the porsche.. killed the ferrari tho"   Man I love Yanni 😂
The Porsche is likely that quiet only because of German laws restricting excessive Lärmbelästigung (noise pollution). 😂
6:08 I mean the Porsche is also a horse, their emblem has a horse in it.😂
Porsche
Yanni jumped the first race that’s exactly what happened
Definitely the grey one on the 'far'
Yanny  , get out of those  Lambogoolies  , So  over rated ...
Porsche turbo s
Just 911 turbo
Taking Porsche for sure 👍🏻
Dont even need to watch the whole thing to know the Ferrari loses.  Should have brought the SF90
Porsche has, as always, taken apart the competition.... 👌🤌🤏👍👏
Porche is the best
These  lambos   And Ferraris all bark and no bite , good wall poster cars tho
Typically understated as always, function vs form the right way round, excellence was expected!
For me is the Lamborghini Aventador ❤❤❤❤❤
Porsche. You can put over 100,000 miles on it and not rebuild the motor 4 times. Also faster, better engineered, and better built. Did I mention cheaper? It’s a no brainer.
One Porsche horsepower is equal to 2 horsepower 🤨
Porsche FTW! German engineering 🇩🇪
Really hard to watch this . Stop advertising your BS 1st Second concentrate on racing and less talking. Watch some other car shows and recreat ... that's all
That Italian accent was horrible😂😂😂
Porsche 🔛🔝
Porsche cars are beasts
Qualitywise Ferrari sucks hard
Porsche 911 Turbo S no make noise 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😆😆
@Horizontally.Opposed you wanna tell me Porsche is slower? Come on, hit me with some delusion😂
This is amazing! And what's more amazing is that if you put a Keonigsegg Jesko in there it would make them look slow.  And when these cars top out, the Jesko would shift into 8th grear and continue on for another 100mph faster.
Porsche ❤️
Lambo and Ferrari beat each other. Porsche Turbo S beats physics.
Porsche Showed up who is the ultimate winner 🏆 😅( even though they focused on Lambo and Ferrari )
Another 2-3 pulls, and ferarri would shows bunch of error codes 😅
911 never put you down
812 for looks and craziness and porsche for performance
The most winner got ignored 😂
Love the Turbo S! ❤
L B good looking
The Porsche sounds good, the other ones are too deafening😅
6:06 very cheeky Yanni
When the loudest is the slowest and the quietest is the fastest
911: One Car to Rule Them All
Hey Porsche do you want to warm up your tires or anything since you going against super cars? Porsche: no I am good. 😂
Ferrari 812
german efficiency
The loudest ones are usually the weakest
Afrer all, all those cars will lose to a Tesla for sure.😂
Lambo is just a douche mobile. Porsche has engineering and class.
Sad that racing has become simply putting your foot down.
10:56 cheeky matt
What did Tom Cruise say .." Porsche there is no substitute" but I love that damn Ferrari 🙌
Does Porsche quote bhp at the wheel, because it doesn't make sense
Lamborghini ❤😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂w you w the first time 😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
First i thought he is speaking another language 😅
Made in Germany ❤❤
"Uh oh!"
"Uh oh!"
The Porsche is just the perfect all round car
Obvious porche
Porsche king of all wheel drive. Mclaren king of rear wheel drive. The other 2 nothing
Ferrari the best overall but that Porsche is a 0-100/1/4 mile, track monster
The SVJ demolished the competition in the sound test, the turbo s just launches like nothing else
The 812 and and svj are fairly comparable speed wise but the svj is just styled like a cartoon,the 812 with rwd 800hp n/a angelic sounding v12 and beautiful styling takes the cake, Despite the Porsche being quicker and far better value for money it’s just a bit bland
911 S Turbo 🎉🎉❤
“Enough silly accents!”   Then immediately proceeds to go into a British accent.
Super fast all day everyday
That Porsche is no joke!
The accent...you  did it great
Everything is not on sound guys
Love Yani, funny chap
Porsche Ferrari Lambo.
Lambo with Ferrari engine and Porsche brakes
Doesn't matter the performance.. How can you buy a Porche when you can buy a Ferrari V12???
Ferrari & Lamborghini fighting really hard for the 2nd Place.
TurboS: kids
la Porsche con soli 650 cv  fa 10.2!!!!!!!!!   con 800 farebbe 9.9😊 e le umilierebbe
Porsche beast 💪 😎💯👍🏽
The main race was between svj and ferrari 😂
The 812 ist the best sounding v12 ive every heard nice video!🎉
If i can possible buy super car, i buy the F12 tdf and 458 speciale
Bro porsche way cheaper  way faster
7:04 в янни вселился меллстрой?
porsche lying about their hp 😂
Porsche 💯
Yea since when has a lambo been faster than a ferrari
Ferrari
just trying to imagine that if porsche have same hp as them
i love the looks of the 812 but for a daily I would take the Turbo s because it doesn't stand out as much. Everyone knows a Ferrari but only car people know Porsche.
7:16 Uh oh 7:28 Get through
Svj
Always the Porsche as you can use it for everyday usage. The Lamborghini looks bad, so second choice would be the Ferrari
No car can beat svj in sound
The porsche is on steroids 😭
Who’s in the Porsche
Obviously the Lamborghini sounds the best
812 superfast
Lamborghini 100 Percent
When two dogs fight over a bone, the third runs away with it...911 you little bugger 🙂
Porsche ☠️
The Porsche may be quitter but it’s faster the everyone else 😎🗿
Im going with that ferrari all day Matt!
Porsche. Thats the reason why I've got a Turbo S. My 12th Porsche. I never drove another brand
For sheer drive exoerience porsche all the way  For the looks Ferrari 812 then porsche and still no to lambo..
Ferrari masterpiece
The acceleration of porsche is phenomenal
Porsche manda...es como esa mosca que lambor y ferrari no se quitan de encima😂
So the ferrari is the fastest just not off tbe line
911turbo s is insaneee
Waste Ferrari cars
😊  öm o
Maldito porsche, tiene un maldito motor.😂😂😂
Ferrari sounds the best by far
SVJ without any hesitation at all
When it comes to Porsche 911 turbo, there's absolutely no substitute
Turbo S,  the best
Lambo
Porsche Is only one, I wouldn't be scared drive fast in heavy rain.
Difficult choice but it has to be the Porsche!!!!!
812
Bmw m5 cs laughing in corner 💀
Porsche with like 100-150 Hp less and still won
3 very different cars designed for very different purposes. if you're going from London to Le Man's you want the Ferrari, if you want a practical high performance car to drive every day you want the Porsche and if you got a little sausage and you can't pull girls you want the lambo. facts
Ferrari
Always the 911 Turbo S
Lambo 😂
I'd have the Porsche every day of the week - money no object,  I'd buy a manual LP640 for the weekends if I were to buy a Lambo.
Ferrari sounded the best
Porsche be like 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
The feriri will beaucause is the fastest
Lamborghini ❤
4:17 porsche sounding like a air conditioner next to these v12 beasts lol
5:03 That Lambo sounds like a killer rap beat😂🔥
The Porsche 911 is the more affordable exotic.
lambo svj everyday
Has to be the Porsche 911Turbo S, all day, every day!!!  Plus if ya had to drive a one of these cars as a daily driver, nothing is better than a Porsche 911❤🎉
I'll take the porsche any day
812 definitely need to be in the collection
For looks i rather go with lambo, but i def would get the posche!
Porsche being Porsche 😂😂😂
812 ALL DAY
Porsche 😛
Porsche, the boringest winner.. 😐
I’m 1/4 German 🇩🇪
Good accents 😂
I would rather go for the Porsche ❤️ always
Anderson Gary Garcia Christopher Johnson Elizabeth
Ted says the Ferrari is the best
The Porsche is also a much better daily driver. A true sleeper that blends in better with everyday cars on the road, beautiful, but not as flashy, but in a good way. A car you wouldn’t be scared to leave in a parking lot, for a short time, at least.
porsche wont be cheap after other 2 depreciated
porsche guys may not watching these vids cuz they already know that PORSCHE will win.
The Turbo S disrespect is funny but dammit I still wanted the cabin cam!
amazin porsche . 911 italian killer
Hooligan 😂😂
The Porsche
Which would I have by best looking,  1. Porsche 2. McLaren 3. Bull 4. Horse
Porsche is usian bolt
Lamborghini
Porsche is fast but looks and sounds boring as fuck, I’ll their the SVJ or the super fast every day over it.
That is the fastest porche but that’s not the fastest Ferrari. Bring the other Ferrari and teach that porch a lesson. Also I would rather have a slower car than a dull fast car.
Porsche lost the sound challenge
Thats why i love porsche
Turbo S
Porsche smoked all of them and broke even better too! So much money to get destroyed by a cheaper car! Hence why imma get my turbo S next!!!
812 better, sexier👍👍👍
Lamborghini always
The Porsche isn’t the better car it just has insane launch but other than that it’s the slowest and I would never take it over the other two
Everybody talking abt the Porsche, and how its really fast n stuff, bit there is one thing a Porsche owner can't say: "i drive a Ferrari."
Ferrari v12 800 hp but it run like panda,Lamborghini v12 770 hp,and run like out breaths,Porsche 650hp got half engine to other 2 car  but out run both ,big engine don’t mean shit over priced
Porsche was Cooking with this one
lol et us warm our tyres, Porsche, ill Just click Sport Mode
911 turbo s is superior
Lambo be like: Imma win the european battle Turbo s: Please stop deluding yourself just cause you have a V12
I salute two NA cars vs a Turbo cars, not to mention the 812 was reeling in the Porsche on the roll without turbos needed, impressive
Two NA engines versus a turbo engine. So stupid to have unfair race as this
Lamborghini is faster
Porsche winsssssssssssss
812 Superfast for me.
812 sounds the best
Lambo!  That Porsche was crazy in the drag race!
Porsche 911 is the best car ever hands down
Fun fact: The horse on the Porsche's logo is actually the same horse as the Ferrari logo, therefore the bull didn't actually beat the horse
I would choose the Ferrari if I had that much amount of money cause all front engine cars are more practical and it got a v12 all u need is a novitech exhaust then ur good to go.
Esos Porsche están creados por el sol y la luna 🥮🌑
so the Turbo Rocket R is just .2 seconds faster in a dragrace than a standard Turbo S?
911 i would have
I love farrari ❤🎉
Loved the accents😂 when u said 1744kg I was like great how many pounds (american) then right after I get that 262 thousand pounds 😂😂 amazing
Bye Porsche stick to drifting
Lambo jumped to earyl
Why did the Porsche not when he 3rd race?
The Porsche always, its not even competition
#1 Ferrari  #2 Porsche  #3 Lamborghini
SVJ all the way!!!
Ferreary
Lambo sounds the best, all day every day

ferrari
Yanni and mat definitely makes the video more fun
Not quite Super fast Enough!! LMAO
3:59
10000000% the SVJ its my favrought car🙂
Always amazing to see how the gearing with the transmission plays a big role in top end speed
I'd get the porshe and remove the soft limiter due to practicality.
It will be interesting to try bugatti vs lamborghini vs ferrari vs porsche..
Like your videos but please shorten the intro.  5 minutes before we see a car move!
Labo il take the labo and labe frariiiii dieeee
Hahahahahahahahahhahahahahaa
911 👑

Made in Germany 🍺🍺🇩🇪🇩🇪
They say you can do a lot when you are quiet  and the  porsche proved  that .💫
Yanni again? Such an annoying loser. Makes me stop watching this video.
Porsche 😊
4:51 4:57 5:02 5:04 5:06 9:38
Porschen 911🔛🔝
Ferrari has got great looks but there can only be one winner..
911
Where's CS PANDA can't find their yt or Instagram channel
You should speak in the Italian accent from now on.
SVJ Sound the best
i love how the 812 screams😂
Porsche is amazing
1:15 1:15 1:17 1:18 1:19 1:20 1:21

Yanny dip like a foot race😂😂😂😂had to laugh....that turbo S is worth every dime👍🏾🇯🇲#dreamcar #porschedealerJA
Porsche ☠️🔥
Between the Lambo and Ferrari i’ll take the Ferarri all day every day!
Ferrari did a lot better when it didn’t leave nearly a full second after the others 😂
Porsche = racional Ferrari e lamborghini = emocional
The dog barks, the caravan passes
Porsche Porsche Porsche
Porsche roasted those asses
Matt PLEASE STOP calling AWD cars Four wheel drive it is not the same thing!
Sir who will win
Porsche é Porsche né, pai
porche 911 turbo s legendary 💪
Lamborghini svj by a mile it’s my dream car
😢..the loudest is the weakest..
of course the 3.8 l twin turbo
porsche sounded the best
Turbo S
812 ❤ in love
Im taking either the 911 or 812. But ofc would take svj anyday if it's given lol
I love Porsche
Now, on my 3rd Porsche, 914, 930, and now 977  (911 Turbo S), I'm a Porsche guy, so I'm just glad it did well.
the accent was pretty good mat...
Lamborghini
The Lambo!
What horses are porches using as their measurement of hp
4:56 that SVJ sounds insane
The Porshe. I own one. Everything else is secondary.
Udydid
The Porsche only
Lamborghini jumped on the first race.
I‘d have the Porsche all the way.
Ferrari is faster, Ferrari has the highest motor. It’s faster then Lamborghini and Porsche 💪🏻
Porsche is a monster. I just wish they sound alot better. I would definitely upgrade the exhaust if i had one
Porsche any day of the week
Porsche does better at most thing with less.....that's saying something!!
When you buy a car , you buy a sound , about Porsche .???????
Ferrari best engine ever
oh my love for porsche is growing
😂😂,, I love the accent play 😂
Nichts schlägt ein deutschen….Porsche 911
Porsche 911 Turbo S If 12 Flat Engine ? 🚂 Just 3.8 Flat Engine Vs  Ferrari Lamborghini V12 Engine
Bang on. Now the Ferrari needs 10,000 pounds in service because somebody accidentally drove it. The Lamborghini demonstrates is gorgeous sound and exciting looks. And Porsche quietly walks away with all the performance.
Ferrari 812 SuperFast
The Ferrari is gorgeous, but that Porsche is a monster.
Lamborghini
Ne oldu 911 ile eyleniyordunuz ikinizide tokat manyağı yaptı 911 torbo s arabaların babadı onun rakibi nissan gtr😂
porche
Kids underestimate Porsche 😂
I think porche wasted resources on that, car the price 🤔
Porsche!!!
Matt it's not a "PORSH"
That 812 is better looking and sounding, no questions.  And less expensive!
Why I love Porsche cars.  No fuss, all business.  And does it over and over again.  But, the Ferrari V12 is a glorious equipment.  Why choose? Just keep both.
É por isso que amo o 911 turbo s 😍
Lamborghini aventador svj because ferraris suck and so do porsche
Yani is so toxic
LAmbo always the last one
Ferrari is king
Let's be real ... On every track on this world the Porsche driver could have a nap and still be No1.... It is a real driver's car . But You cannot disgrace the Ferrari ... She is a beauty, Lamborghinis are ridiculous ...  neither style nor quality nor attitude.  The 812 gts is the perfect car to cruise through the roving hills of the Toscana ... but the Porsche 911 Turbo is the ultimate weapon ... I wonder what they will do with it in the new 992.2 Facelift .. if Porsche will fit it with the same 3.8 engine it would not be much different than the new Carrera GTS ...regarding the engine...but they will find something in Zuffenhausen to keep it the fastest street car (I am talking about a real car amd not a Lamborghini playmobile for little boys). There is only one Ferrari "street car" which can distance the Porsche turbo on the race track ... but only if driven by a very experienced driver.
The Porsche is like an average 9-5 working Dad who’s arm-wrestling his two unruly gym-rat sons, just destroying them with his otherworldly Dad strength.
Porsche sounded the best
Porsche in sound test -🤡Porsche in race -👿
Best ever reaction from Yianny 😅
Whatever Porsche doesnt have on horsepower the RPM makes up for Everything else
That's why i ❤ Porsche ❤❤❤❤
911 Turbo S!!!
I want the SVJ
SVJ ❤❤❤
I would get the Porsche for sure. Best cars
"Porsche, there is no substitute."
Piss take in price  Go go porsche ❤
Why do Brit’s pronounce the German ‘Porsche’,  PORSH - when it’s an actual Spanish name (PORSH-ah) but they say the French word  ‘Coupe’ pronounced COOP-PAY? (I’m well aware ‘American’ English has countless inconsistencies, lol)
the porche engineer know exactly whats there motive was...😅
Which car do I want? Of course, the Beetle from Stuttgart!  Modest, unpretentious livable, easiest for everyday use...  And what a beast!
Porsche
If you put equal exhaust in the Ferrari as the lambo like a Gintani or Novitec pipe system, the 812 sounds better than the SVJ
Ferrarz looks fantastic, as from style perspective I mean, but so does porsche wich is actually much more better overall. And its worth half the money of the ferrary. The lambo is a pretty nice car but not close enough to the other 2, especiallzy concidering the price
I will choose Lamborghini SVJ 😊 And sell it and buy a Porsche turbo S and a Ferrari 812 😂
This video was ahead of its time!
Aston Martin ???
From the multiple consistent passes with the Porsche an beat both of them I'd take the Porsche but just looks of the car Ferrari
06:49 best drag race
SVJ just for the sound. 🥹
Germane and Japan pillers are motor fields ❤
Im taking that svj cya
That Porsche is a beast
Ferrari ❤
Porsche = class Lambo/ferrari = fashion
SVJ
Lambo all the way
Put a proper exhaust on the Porsche and will be the best car! 🎉
Farrai is the best
I'm choose the Ferrari. It looks waaay better
Fastest 3 count ever
Eu teria uma Porsche
Me, I'm not so rich ... I can only afford ONE of those ... (Ha ha, and it comes in SO many different colors, and it's quietest too, I like that I am not so rich)
The Porsche:  Cheapest car ... Least HP ... Most Quiet (I HATE Loud, loud is stupid and immature)        Porsche, There is no substitute !
Why cant Porsche make awesome exhaust note?
GERMAN ENGINEERING 💪🏻 🇩🇪
Porsche 911👍👍👍💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
0:06 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jjy
If I had like £200,000 for a carcI would actually go with a Weismann MF5. Super rare, beautiful looking and packing an BMW M5 engine.
Forza ferrari
that 911 turbo is literally the definition of silent but deadly
If money was no object: the Ferrari 10/10 times. Does not matter if it wins in the straight line, it's a damn Ferrari and it looks classy. The SVJ is too aggressive and also I'm not mafioso so I can't run around in the SVJ around these parts without attracting some seriously unwarranted attention.
Porsche uber Alles...
Something is wrong on 812 it's not that slow compared to svj
Porsche is like max verstappen of 2024
Porsche turbo ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Who drove the Porsche?
Porsche 911 Turbo  Rules
easy 911 Turbo S + dakar
porsche said 'Nah i'd win'
I’ll choose the Porsche, thanks.
812 superfast's design and sound is better than SF90's
The fact that the Lambo owner chose to put a fake "63" on the car speaks volumes about what type of people drives an Aventador. Lame.
It's Porsche! not Porsh
Guys, not everything is about power, torque and top speed on paper. Porsche proves that. It is about perfect launch control.
Italy is everywhere
porshe half the price of the lambo its a done deal id buy the german auto,,same foe ferrari too expensive,,
ferrari
Lambo all day every dayyyy
Id have the ferrari everyday.
What is be happening if the Porsche was 12 cilinders 😅????
lamborghini
Ferrari❤
Porsche is the king in a launch control
I will take the SVJ
CS panda is just gone
The thing is, this is the fastest version of the aventador while that is the slowest version of the 812? Do it again with a 812 competizione and she will smoke everything
what ever anyone say i go with ferrari...
911 all day, but if I had the money, the Ferrari just because it's a harder flex when you pull up lol.
Lamborghini always loses
porche best looking car
911
Looking at the title: Yada Yada whatever VS .... Porsche 911 Turbo S. Allready knowing the outcome xD
TurboS
please do a bugatti chiron ss vs koenigsegg
Ferrari
Porsche
812 Superfast sounds the best 🇮🇹
I never trust Yanny with  the break test 🤣
Porsche all day long!
Porshe king🎉🎉
its like v12 playing, while Porsche is the camera man 😂😂😂
all you can say is that fcking porche, how bout installing full titan exhaust on that Porsche?😂
Porsche like a tesla car, yes speed but no sound, Man any car has a good sound with really bad speed is way way better than 911. At least in my opinion
Actually Porsche has the best sound for a daily driver
Porsche is flying
This just proves to me that lamborghini is just to show of cause yes it looks and sounds the best but if it is about power porsche beats him and costs less than half of it. I think lamborghinis arent worth it.
Porsche 911 Turbo S
That Porsche is the grand-grand-grandson of Disney's Herbie ! 😂
6.59 min always killing me ..... tipycal
911 turbo s ❤❤❤
Sports car beating super car
3:41 Ferrari rev test 3:57 svj test
Half the cylinders...twice the engineering. German beats Italian every single day. The Porsche also look a hell of a lot better - both the exterior and interior.
Lamborghini
Ill take the ferrari anyday…. What people dont know is that this isn’t the highest trim like the other competitors 🥶…. 812 Competizione is…. Let that sink in….
Yeah 😅
8:21 that laugh
SVJ all day!
Svj.   😊
I Ike the first one it's sound better
The All rounder porsche ❤
Porsche always… and a spare £100k for some mods 😂
Would love to own an 812 Superfast ❤
It not the cars it’s the drivers
Lamborghini is ugliest, most expensive, and dumb. If you own one, you’ve never changed your own oil or put a spare on.
Porsche 911 turbo S any day of the week
lambo (y)
Porsche
Wtf that porsch is insane
To answer the 2 unanswered questions of Mat: The reason why the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ has not a dual clutch and is around 200kg lighter than the Ferrari is coherent. Meaning Lamborghini decided to go with the single clutch so save weight.
Their clothes fits so well to the cars 😂 bet the Porsche has a well suited man
i would have the ferrari
How is it that porsche wins? Half the price, less hp, underdog brand, ... I don't get it why ferrari and lambo are not performing better knowing the price, history and status.. anyone can explain how they do it?
not the flat 6 beating 2 v12 s lmao
German cars are built different 🗿
The whole world knows...the Ferrari 812 Superfast is a legend
first
hey farmer go back to your farms.!! went real.!!
It's funny that they don't even think about beating the Porsche, just competing with each other. Porsche Supremacy!
Italian plastic cars are still trying hard with their numerous cylinders cars to no avail😂🤣🤣
porche sounded best!!! (dont hate :))
Porsche
Every pound counts. The heavy fella in the Lamborghini….yea….
I love Lambos but that 812 SuperFast is a thing of beauty.
6:15 there not “about” something, they’re simply the best. It just goes to show that you don’t need a million cylinders and hundreds of thousands of dollars on a price tag to make a quick and fun car…
Porsche Turbo
Lambo looks great✨✨✨
V6 against two V12s
That’s what I call German engendering
An empty vessel does sound much
Ferrari: We invented this stuff McClaren: We do everything as perfectly correctly as possible  Porsche: I can make a Beetle ruin all of your work.
My love lambo 😌😌❤
Porsche is King👌🫀
Porsche 911 turbo s is still gangsta till Ferrari SF90 Stradale comes to ruin his day hehe 🤪
that Porsche is a quite kid but when its time to show power its the one beast of a car
The best 3 cars ever ever song and power engine❤❤❤❤
911
I love Lamborghini but not fast enough like the sf90
You have got to love Yianni's energy !! Legend !
Porsche not a lot “sxxx talkn” the shape is perfection ..the light weight . I’ve seen on the freeway when a lambo was racing corvette  car .. a Porsche 911 came up behind and neither wanted to race it ; wise. The plus the way Porsches hug curves is unmatched at high speeds .
Porsche
Porsche🗿
Porsche, the strong silent type.
Porsche There is no Substitute!
Flat six on back is cooking 😂if porsche decides to make hypercar all another hyper cars retired from being a car!!!
911 turbo s is the beast
🇩🇪
The Porsche is by far the best car I have seen on this Chanel, when it comes to price.
SVJ
When you think about it the Porsche is the better car out of all three of them and most cars for the price range you are wasting your money when you buy the lambo Ferrari and Bugatti😂💣. 02-18-24
W porsche ‘e’
How do you possibly choose between these... You can't.. All are amazing machines, wouldn't you say? Superfast is $350k. SVJ is over $500k. turbo s is $210k. I put down a deposit for 2019 turbo s yesterday and will prob get it by end of next week. I looked at 812, F8, Huracan Evo, GT3 RS in used car markets as well. These were 1-2 years newer. Price 100-200k more expensive than turbo s. Well I chose turbo s because I''ve a porsche owner for years, it's the most reliable car by miles (except the same brand GT3 RS), it's the cheapest to buy and probably maintain, it can be a daily, etc,. Would I buy one of the others in the future? Hell yes. It really depends on what you can afford and what you want from your car I guess. I'm definitely looking to get both Ferrari and Lambo in the future when I can COMFORTABLY afford it. I don't want car broken.
The car I would hate to have on the drive (owned a 911 and never again) , is the fastest. Lesson is you can’t beat Germans.
Dammm
Dammm
Lambo
SVJ sounds
911 all the time
If the phrase “Silent but Violent” applied to a car, it would perfectly describe the 992 Turbo S.
MAN IN LOVE WITH THE LAMBO
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ is my vote.
I’m now wondering how the porsche is so slow on it’s sportiest setting 🤔
Porsche is cool, calm, and collected. Lamborghini is loud and obnoxious. Ferrari is cocky and can’t back it up.
Everytime you see that Porsche it just does the business man. Smokes everything.
Just imagine flat 12 cylinder porche 🥶
Has anyone thought how a car with half the cylinders in its engine than opposition can win.
porsche
Porsche respectfully humbled the so called "big daddies" (Ferrari & Lamborghini)
Yanni and a lambo....best duo
Porsche is perfect.  The oldest one, the fastest one and the quietest one.
Porshce is like Talk less work more
Porsche is in royalty 😮😂
Lamborghini
C'est un véritable spectacle de rêve pour les amateurs de voitures ! En regardant la course de la Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, de la Ferrari 812 et de la Porsche 911 Turbo S, je ressens de l'adrénaline et de l'excitation. Chacune de ces supercars est incroyable dans sa catégorie, et cette course montre leur puissance et leur vitesse dans toute leur splendeur. Un événement incroyablement impressionnant !
The language impressions tho 😂😂😂🎉
It's kinda hard tbh 812s fire but svjs fire too but the porsche hard asf
The best drag race video on this channel
what porsche createt is jjust crazy
812 super fast my dream super car
Id collect the whole set.
LABMOGHINI ANYDAY EVERY DAY
Porshe winned 😂
Lambat is the best or posh must be good maybe
Yianni lost coz he was lifting off for changes....had he kept his foot planted😮
Superfast, super sexy, 812...✊🏿
I like the porsche
ferarri for class lamborghini for flaunting porsche for daily
😂 I literally hear nothing but Aventador 🤟
Porsche is a man's car lambos are for boys and Ferraris are for little girls
Porche is still diffrent class
Still the lambo all day long for me
SVJ is the best
THE PORSCHE SOUNDS GREAT!!!!
THE PORSCHE!!!!
911 turbo s
I would like the 812
And porche did not even warm up its tires for the first run damn love porche cars
My dream cars which I wanna have are AMG GT-R Coupe in dark green or 911 Turbo S in grey. And the car of my dreams (which I know I might not be able to buy where I live) is actually the Ferrari 812
My dream cars which I wanna have are AMG GT-R Coupe in dark green or 911 Turbo S in grey. And the car of my dreams (which I know I might not be able to buy where I live) is actually the Ferrari 812
the Ferrari sounded better NGL.
Fr
SVJ over the Superfast BUT...Competizione over the SVJ.
Yanni jumped the start on the first race tho
ferrari
i still love the 812 GTS. and will be my first supercar
Its was race of Ferrari vs lamb ko porche just chilling 😂
I still don’t get how the Porsche wins… the other car got 100-150hp more
m5 smiling in the cornenr 🥶
It doesn't matter if you have a 6.5 l car the German will beat it
Ferrari and Lamborghini warm up their tyres while Porsche waits patiently to do what it does all day every day
Tem alguem BRASIL??
L
Lambo best sound
ferrari has always beat all lambos but lamborghini has revenge on ferrari today.take that enzo!
Porsche or Lambo
porche sound is the best bcz its a secret killer
Dj khaled lost
Porsch
For what its worth, the Porsche for sure
It’s hilarious how Yanni gets all pumped up. You can literally see his blood pumping 😂
No cheating allowed
Porsche is best but I'll pick 812.
I swear mat always jumps
Wait why is Matt not in the Porsche? Oh this is 3 years old before he became Porsche’s number one fan 😂 now you never see him driving anything else
Bruh Im so in love with Porche that if someone offers me a Porche or Bugatti. Ima get the bugatti so I can sell it and get some porches
Lol thought the Porsche was a Honda ..
Imagine you discover Mat through this video, the start is gold!! xd
If I had to pick one car, I'd pick the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
I would have Porsche 911 turbo s for the track and other fun.
For a RWD that Ferrari is a monster
That Porsche is a masterpiece of engineering 💥💪👊
I love the Lamborghini too but I just like the 812 superfast better
812 superfast bro that things a beast 😊
Porsche is a great super car , but looks boring. Good looking but same shape since forever.
Different story when you cheat
Farrari
If I'm not mistaken. Porsche was the first race car
porsche is like three asian kid that has good grades and people act like it’s nothing…”because he is asian”
I m so impressed by Porsche🔥
Porsche 911 Turbo s 1.  Ferrari 812 Superfast 2. Lamborghini Aventador SVJ 3 . !
Porsche 🔥🔥🔥
Youtubers trying to race lmao
I would hv the Ferrari
Lamborghini for sure and then second car Porsche you could boost upgrade that with the turbo and really get her going
The Lamborghini is better to look @ in your drive way , but I much rather the Porsche everytime 🎉
I'd gladly lose in a Superfast over the other two. But I'd especially rather lose in a GTC, although I suppose some of these are more GT Black range.
770 vs 650 hp
Oh my days the blokes at Porsche know what they are doing! The 911 is absolutely wicked. It's also something that isn't IMPOSSIBLE to afford. Plus Porsche won't sue you if you modify, repaint or wrap it! YES IM LOOKING AT YOU FERRARI! Imagine if Porsche was ACTUALLY trying to directly compete with Lamborghini and Ferrari at the same price point on a regular basis? They would be in Koenigsegg territory.
"Porsche is the best engineered car" while this drag race is turbo vs natural aspirated
Porsche
lambo sounds the best
911 Turbo S all day er day no capperoni
Porche
Not quite Super fast enough 😂😂😂 8:03
Porsche is the best bang for the buck
Lamborghini aventador svj ❤❤❤❤
PORSCHE 911 any day ...👍👍👍👍👍👍
As a 911 owner we are gentleman and we don’t fck around we get the job done!
Lano Is italiano
Lamborghini aventador svj ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
The Porsche engineers knew exactly what their objective was .........
Give me the Ferrari everyday.
Porsche 992 turbo S is the king of drag race.
Porsche is the best 💪
Porsche is in silence but performance not 💯❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Great test. Such a pity about the mummy’s boy giggle..🙄
I’ll take the Porsche turbo all day long fellas!
Definitely not expected that. Porsche be like: F u Italian boys, let me show u what i can do with half de cylinders and money 🤣
Ferrari
I would chose the 911
Ferrari
Everybody with a brain will choose the 911 Turbo S... Everybody with a heart will choose one of the other 2... As an engineer.... I'll go German power all the way.
German engineering 💪🏻💪🏻
Would have the porche for looks because it's lovely as it is without saying pure boy racer then it gives them a showing up for half the price and comfortable to drive daily
Porsche the GOAT 🐐
done
How did 650hp win against 770 horsepower with an equally good launch?
Lambo
Svj
I’d take a Porsche over any car on any day, they can be driven everyday and destroy most cars.
And the Porsche will continue to perform beyond 100k miles on the engine.
Lamborghini
Porsch the best 🇩🇪🤜🇮🇹🇮🇹
Porche 911 is my FAVV car
Porsche is so modest, it looks the least bright, almost no different in appearance from its cheap models, its sound is the quietest, it doesn’t even sound like a supercar, but it is faster than both Ferrari and Lamborghini. Yes, Porsches are cool!
So why do my dad bought a lamborghini aventador
Okay okay let's clear things here :  Italian cars are crazy and beautiful, but German ones are the ROAD BOSS 🙈🙊🙉
812 is my favorite but for a daily the 911 is definitely the one to run around incognito.
B6 beating v12s Porsche only throw quality
I'd rather have the 911 Turbo S
812 getting off in rwd is crazy insane car
So awesome when yani races
porsche babyyy
Quite, Simple and BEAST... simply porsche  😊 ☠
Porche
This prove ... Porsche is  best in that price and Lamborghini is best in that price. You can't get the fun and thrill with the posche like the Lambo or Ferrari which I agree but the Porsche is also cheaper.
lambo has a big wing ferrari does not have it it also makes a diff for a close race
For me its sound better the 812
turbo s
Lambo. And sell it to get 2 turbo S
Porsche says “who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted”
Porsche 911 turbo S exactly ❤
Thats why its called SUPERAST
Porsche is the true Sigma
That 650 bhp makes all the difference with that 800Nm torque. Hats off to the engineers who designed this masterpiece.
wouldnt it make sense to do the drag races after the rolling starts and brake tests, when the tires are naturally warm?
Its almost like all these races are just Porsche promo videos. I would use these videos if I were selling Porsches. haha!
Mat you quoted the dry weight for the svj
For the sound Check  1st: Lamborghini Aventador SVJ   2nd: Ferrari 2017 812  3rd: Porsche 911 Turbo
After the break test , Matt ask which three of these cars would u have Performance : Porsche Looks : Lambo Awesomeness : Ferrari
SVJ my type of car
The Ferrari
what the hell Porsche 😂beast
wtf that porsche is a missile
Porsche, simply the best, try doing 50 starts one after the other and see who left
The Porsche is a drivers car end of
Where do you get a turbo s for 150k 👀 gotta pay at least 250k on retail here in Germany
that 911 is a complete psycho
It’s very close but I had to choose the SVJ
Naturally aspirated cars are slower than turbo boost engine. But naturally aspirated cars are reliable.
812
Lamborghini wins🎉🎉
Lamborghini looks like crap. Reminds of an L.A. idiot
Porcha was here to represent 🫡
Porsche for sure!
Lamborghini depnetnly
PORSCHE, ALL DAY LONG !!!… Fun to watch though…
The Lamborghini
Lambo revs the best
Yannimize like your hat it’s says Lamborghini your in a Lamborghini🤣lol
There's no doubt about it! Porsche All Day Everyday...👌😎
Ferrari 812 superfast all the WAAAAAAYYYYYY.
porsche is just insane bro cheaper then both of these overpriced cars
Porsche although it is 650hp it win the race
Porsche is the best super car
PORSCHE
Be in silence let ua success make noise❤❤❤
Ferrari sounded the best and u cant judge a porsche in revs at a standstill they have a soft limiter. Once its in gear it sounds million times better
Porsche in this is like those guys in the gym that look small and skinny, but are actually built like a Greek God under their oversized t-shirt
Porsche forever <3
❤
FERRARI 812!!!!!!!!!!!
Ferrari 812!!!
Of those 3 particular cars the Ferrari.   If the Porsche was a more interesting colour I’m going Porsche
FERRARI

SVJJJJ
Ferrari is sounding better
I will ha e the porsche any day of the week! 😁 And I could take my wife and 2 kids with me! That cant be done in the Ferrari or lamborghini... 😅
Lamborghini is actually the ugliest lol
Actually the competition is between the lambo and iconic Porsche ♥️ ferrari is just a viewer
0:11 he sounded like Cristiano Ronaldo for a second
For the looks, Lambo’… for the looks only, on a special « show off » day. Wait, I don’t have show off days on my calendar . Porsssccchhhhh of course
Definitely  a porsche
You deserve your success mate, you're too funny when you imitate italians 😂
Porsche wasnt taking any of it
Ngl that Porsche sounded fantastic.
When Porsche 911 stands in any race. The result is clear❤
Lamborghini is the best
Turbo S every day 😍🥳🙌🏾
People forget that porche as not a eighth of the aero of the lambo and it is 4wd. THey all look shocked in the comments
PORSCHE EVER !!!
Imagine 812 sf was AWD
There is just something about the Aventador its everything a Lambo should be. It's like everything the Murcielago was trying to be.
Ferrari: Looks Lambo: Sound  Porsche: Performance   What a triooo 🔥🔥🔥
Lambo for life.
Lamborghini
Porsche
Lambo ❤
Ive never seen a Lamborghini win any race😂😂😂😂😂
The person driving the 812 doesn't know how to drive we definitely see it's full potential.
Very well done Porsche 911 Turbo S! A supercar! Hats off!! My favorite brand car!
The turbo s is the ultimate camera car, screw the m5 e39🤭
Ferrarri sounded better
Im a bout 3 yrs late but def the svj just cuz of the torc the sound and size im gonna get one 😂
Porsche all day every day
Schools
Lambo
Il have the Porsche every day over that Ferrari and definitely over that horrendous looking Lamborghini which I’m not a fan of any Lamborghinis
turbo s porsche forever❤
porsche so fast no body cares💀
Now we need a Porsche 911 Turbo S Vs A Lamborghini Hurracan or a Performante
What is it with german power   German hp = 100 more than usual HP
Bro Strada means Street in Italian Thats Why Yanney Lost The Rolling Race
Svj
lmfao the turbo s is so freaking fast they didn't even care to look at it cause they knew it would win thats wild asf to bad it sound close to an electric car stock
Ferrari is a Italian car like the lsmbo
Lamborghini and Ferrari with all the noise. Meanwhile Porsche speaks softly but carries a big stick.
porsche wins the battle between lamborgini and ferrari
the porsche doesn’t sound best becz the turbos in it sucks very large amount of hot air from exhaust
can you please talk about how freaking fast that ferrari is!! that roll race was mad
I LIKE LAMBORGHINI LAMBORGHINI IT'S CARS THE BEST❤
WOW third video i watched today with the 911 Turbo S and everytime 10.2 sec
Lambo every time
you can never beat German building . Never . lambo fan for the looks , ferrari lover for the pedigree, but german engineering goes all the way
🐼  watching his car break slowly:   👁🫦👁
Aventador is the best sound
Yanni is a great driver
LAMBORGHINI
Team SVJ 👇
SVJ
Lambo sound tiered the hear,  🤧✌️
Get this SVJ v Mark McCann’s SVJ cause they’re the same car but do far different times
Ferrari for sure
Thats not even the 812 competizione. Imagine how much quicker it would be.
Porsche all day everyday !
I'd have the Lambo of course
So much problems with the Itlian Ferrari  🤔
german engineering wipes the floor with all
My mate has a 911 Turbo and the Ferrari F12 and 812..his Ferraris have actually been used in a comparison review.. he say the 911 is the best build, best engineered and best for the the everyday drive.
Sorry guys a lot of friends from me measured the porsche on the dyno. 95% got more then 690ps bone stock. Some even 710ps. Why porsche claims 650 because the gt2 most be more exclusive. Porsche cant invent the physik. They can only make a god job.
Lambooooopo all the way looks sounds performance etc..
Ferrari sounds best
Ferrari
911 !!❤
Porsche❤️
Porche is that quiet kid who sits back and shock everyone with his results
Incredible Video To Be Honest
Porche is my dream car 💫💖
Even “Cheating Yanni” couldn’t beat the Porsche ! BAA….BAA….BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA…………..
Porsche Top Car
And lamborghini avenatfor is my dream car so that
For the cheapest car the porsche domonates to 1/4 mile and brake race
Where do you get these prices??? the 812 costs like at least 500k as well as an svj, and a turbo s is like at least 250k
Matt watching as yany roasts the tires 🤣🤣🤣
Porsche looks best as well
That Porsche is the real super fast
Turbo S is the world s best all around Gt  car. Period.
Both Ferrari and Lambo make so much noise.. but the porsche is the silent killer there!
Lamborghini vs Ferrari   Porsche 👍
Lambo
Lamb
S V J
I’d take the 812 any day … svj doing too much for me
Lamborghini
definitely the Porsche, the pizza trays all need at least 200hp more to beat a Porsche🙂
The accents were good😂
Lambo or Ferrari?  neither Porsche
My friends dad has an svj and he had an turbo s
Porsche all day, only car here you can drive daily
Porsche…only
Ferrari and Lambo can Cry loud because they lose against the Porsche.
Matt you've had loads of svj's on the show???
I like to watch your videos Mat
you better get that 918 spyder on the track
The 812 looks better.
porsche off course anytime
Porch 911
Can I have Porsche since nobody wants?
The answer is clear for me. I just bought a 992 turbo s, which I did after watching it embarrass the more expensive super cars on this site. Thanks Matt and Yanni.
Lamborghini is the Best
SVJ
“ SV a’ J” 🤣🤣🤣
بورش
These guys are great. Laugh ever time I watch their vids. Yani (sp?) and Matt are quite the duo. Well done!
sound test first/Lamborghini second/Ferrari third/Porsche 🔥🔥
Ferrari
Safety is most important factor and Germans know very well..... Porche just so worth bro !!
Germans won 🇩🇪
Why do I prefer the Ferrari's sound?
Lambo looks the best
Who is this mulatto ?
Others are nothing to Porsche even they have more torque
Lambo sounded best, epic!
I actually thought the Ferrari sounds better
Is he Farghini?
Porche 911 turbo S all the way
Got to be the Porsche for me. Can use it everyday and is not quite as ostentatious 👍
where to buy lamborghini hat
Gerçek hayatta GTA 5
911 any day. It's a daily driver + weekend car.
Everyone talking about the Porsche❤ DEUTSCHLAND 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
Porsche all the time, everytime. best build best quality, best allround.
I'm in love with porsche since 1998. It is my dream car. Hopefully I'll buy a turbo s in a couple of yeras
Porsche ❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I think I would like the porsche 911 turbo. It looks the best. The ferrari and lamborghini kind of look squeezed
To win over nevers you need to turn the boost even more 😅😅 fuck me this car is no joke
The 911 TurboS costs 250k 🤨
All are saying bad about porsche, but dont understimate by the looks . May be it looks simpler to lamborghini in styling but it has other good things which lamborghini cant do . Lamborghini and ferrari are track focused cars and porsche is a everyday use cars because it is not only a sports car company,  it manufacturers luxury sedans and suv too so i think eventhough porsche didnt focus on sports cars only still porsche beats those track focused and big supercars .
Porsche
I would have the porshe
the italian bull
the svj sounded better
LAMBO always
812
Porche TURBO S... all day long. Lasts forever and can drive it every single day and shit.
Svj for sound and own Lamborghini all the way
911 rocks...
SVJ, Superfast, 911
GOOD MORNING BEAST MAT WATSON CAR WOW CANADA ONTARIO YOUTUBE VIDEO MISSISSAUGA TRANSIT 🇨🇦🇨🇦🌿🌿🍀🍀🍀
Lambo😡 ferrari👄 porsche😐
i low the fact that how matt and yanni just gave up beating the porsche and started beating eachother 😂😂😂😂
Porsche 911 Turbo S
The second launch was not as good as the first one  The lambo definitely did 10.2ish that time
812 superfast sounded best and it is one of my favourite cars ever and it is my favorite Ferrari.
Porsche all day long, even before they started
Ferrari and Lamborghini are are dead heat tie for me can’t choose between them 🙈🙈
I know what car I’m buying now. Porsche.
Porscha
So basically, the strategy here if you could get any of these cars for free, get the SVJ, sell it and buy the Porsche
Ferrari- 3:45 Lambo- 3:56. In-Cabin Sound is both times 🔥
the intro caught me off guard😭
Have the Porsche always wanted one
Does anyone know the name of Starter?
4:58 my Music 🎶
while yes realistically the porsche is the obvious choice id still have the 812 just for the looks and sound
Ferrari Superfast
For the price and off the mark performance   The Porsche.
was waiting for the 812 superfast to be fast, but nevermind its piece of art. "best of three" my POV
One day I will get a 9 1 1
In the Ferrari, you can hear the Ferrari and the Lambo, in the Lambo, you can hear the Ferrari and the Lambo, and in the Porsche... Well... The Ferrari and the Lambo. It is really quick tho.
Id take 812 any day
I'll take the Turbo S all day everyday 😊
Porche all day every day
Ламборгіні😍💪
Svj
Porsche is just in its own lane! Props to the 911
Where can we find Yianni's hat?
porche
Porsche is love ❤
Porsche set examples of being calm
Bro that porsche! Respect
That Porsche is incredible 😮😮😮
Porshe is the prime example of people who talk shit but cant back it up then gets whooped lambo and rarri with all that noise 😂
i have seen enough of the the videos to now wonder who will come in 2nd
Svj
Yanni cheated.
The Ferrari sounds better 'cause it sounds like a Ferrari.
That lambo would have killed the Porsche if they were racing on tracks with actual turns 😂
I love the 911 992 so much, one of my favourite cars of all time! ❤️
Lamborghini sound ❤🎉
Porsche 911 turbo s tha best car on the race
Fararriiiiii 812 superfasttttttttt❤
me not even watching the ferrari and the lambo just happy with the porscheeee
porsche 911 turbo s
911
Porsche experience with the 992.1 turbo s is the highlight of my life
Give me the 812
The Lamborghini
911 turbo s
I love Porsches, but by god, the 812 Superfast is sexy
That Porsche is like an introvert child in the class that does not talk much but always comes first lol
I Would Have the Porsche 911 Turbo S
Porsche as always
812 Super Fast
Just watched this again and realised yianni was such a jerk back then 😂😂
Many Porsches 6-cylindars. Max top end approx 214 mph. While most others 8-cylindars approx 4*7 mph differential being example 218-221mph. Even within 2-additional cylinders.
911 for sure
I love Lamborghinis but seeing this I'm a bit disappointed. Well done Porsche 😮
Man the way he explained the porche 😂😂😂😂
Lambos are overhyped. Classic Porsche for me 😌
Super fast
6zylinder boxer >>v12
i will have a ferrari 812 for sure no hasataite
992 Turbo s
That Italian accent at first 😂 Reminded me of Borat! Good job fellas. Porshe beat you badly., but I'm gonna go with Ferarri.
😂😂😂 Don't underestimate the power of Porsche💪 ❤❤❤
if it were me, i will have the lambo.    "lambo all day, everyday"                                               -yianni
Lambo
Porsche, anyday ❤️
Ferrari 812 Superfast is my dream car
Lambo❤❤
Porsche let’s goo ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lamborghinis exhaust is always insane🔥⚡
Love the Porsche
Lembogn
812
Porsche is the best
porsche is the Greatest car company of All fking time
Porsche ate them all
Porsche is a silent kid in a class
In a second I looked at thumbnail and I thought it was forza horizon 5 😅😅😅
Lamborghini Aventador svj❤
Definitely the Lambo
Lamborghini aventador svj
it definitely tells the truth that horses are faster than a bull
Lambo sang trọng hầm hố
Lamborghini overrated as hell ☕
remove the speed limit and conjure over the exhaust  and there will be a full bouquet of emotions
although I am not a fan of Porsche but I must admit that the 911 Turbo S is a real dragster
Italian art vs German engineering
That Ferrari looks so damn good
7:34 the best moment ever. Yianni doing a head dip into the finish line. Absolute classic move.
Lambo
always Lambo for sure. Already have the P.
i dont get people mentioning engine size, cylinders and hp while the porsche is literally called "turbo"
I would buy the old man Ferrari ❤
Im taking the 812 in red
Porsche says "NO FUN 4 U"
porsche is more worth than its price
The disrespect on italian cars in this comments section is incredible
Porsche 911 ❤❤
Why every drag race with a ferrari, the ferrari breaks something?
Porsche all day long. And a little tune on it. No stopping it
I’ll be taking the beautiful Lamborghini Aventador SVJ please and thank you
911 good job✨
Lambooo❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Best car Porsche 911  Best sound SVJ
Superfast
The 812
I can’t have all?!?!?
Farri
Yanni cheated the 3rd race in the sports setting!
Lambo sounds the best
I thought the Lamborghini would come last
Why is the video all about the Lambo and Ferrari when the Porsche is the star? Who was driving the Porsche?
I would rather have a porsche ❤❤
Dude that porsche's killing at that price range
"Uhh the Porsche!" well said Yanni I am sure a lot of Lambo owners have uttered that same sentiment....lol....Germans FTW!
Honestly Porsche looks better then Lambo
PORSCHE WINS!!!!!!!!!!!
Lamborghini
It doesn't matter if win by a inch or a mile winning is winning
2:06 the reason why it's lighter is bc SVJ only has one clutch instead of two
Porsche is quiet kid in the classroom. He is the smart boy in all around...
992 Turbo! Love it! Next choice will be the Ferrari... Reminds me of a 250 GTB
Yanny notice when the Ferrari was reeling in. Come on uh oh 7:16
Gt3 😤
Ferruccio lamborghini turning in his grave rn
Ferrari is the best
911 turbo s❤❤
Matt i need a clip of those accents at the beginning to have e coolest ringtone.
812 Superfast. I'm all set with the herky jerky single clutch....and the 812 looks better IMO
812 superfast
I doubt this SVJ is tuned bcoz every other SVJ on carwow did the mile in 10.8 seconds at max but only this thing did in 10.4 seconds no other SVJ did it that fast.... So I doubt it
Lambo is such a disappointment
The Porsche shall remain underestimated but keeps wrecking opponents
lambo😀
It's the Lamborghini
German boyyy
The Lambo sounded so much better bruh
Porsche 911 Turbo S for me
Most definitely the Porsche
7:33 mcqueen moment :D
I mean, how can you not love that german accent by mat
Porsche is KING
Well you have two buffoons racing against a guy that knows what he's doing so there's that. Also, 4 wheel drive has a distinct advantage over rear wheel. Also, the Porsche in this race had the most torque. So, no big surprise. For my taste the Ferrari is the best looking of the bunch. I think the Porsche looks like a glorified Beetle which shouldn't be a surprise since Ferdinand Porsche actually designed the beetle. The Lambo looks like a flying wing.
the ferrari is actullay good looking
Porsche
I love “the not quiet superfast enough” 🤣🤣🤣🤟🏻🤟🏻🤟🏻
I must say the Superfast looks sexy.the lambo looks ugly
Porsche a masterpiece of german  engineering! Period!
How can someone be so silly and mess with a 911 Turbo??🙈😀
Look wise Ferrari tops for me!
The Porsche really changed my mind on super cars. Until this video Lamborghini by a mile but that Porsche is pretty damn awesome… I think I have a new favourite “super car”
That Porsche silently killed everyone
porcheye hava atanı severlerrrr.... hrrr
Bro mocking porsche , porsche mocking bro 😂
Porsche is silent but violent.. well both cars is my favorite .
Who's gonna tell him that Strada means Road and not Race ?😂
well ther it is mat watson said it the porsche is the better car
porshce is the auto lambo sounds the best ferrari nah too obviuos , how about rimac & koeneggg now were talking
Ferrari
Ok I did some homework and the 992 Turbo S is giving around 570 to 580 HP at the wheel on dynos completely stock. A quick calculation will tell you this is 715 to 725 HP at the crank. This is what the motherfucking Germans do, underrate their cars HP by 10 to 15% so they murder the cars on he same power class and some of the ones above. No wonder is faster than these two heavier cars and can keep up with a 720 S or a 488 pista on the straights. What is even more worrying is that the car can do up to 700 HP at the wheel and even more with just an ECU reflash, and some high performance fuel and an exhaust. That's 850 to 900 hp on the crank with minor changes...
Porche  every time
The porche  is a silent killer
To think of it, the 750HP M3 xDrive is faster than all these three cars is just astonishing
Porsche has a e at the end please pronounce it properly
Porsche 911 Turbo S
I would rather go for the Porsche. Besides speed and its outstanding performance, it is also practical and can easily be used as a daily car.
Yianni is the funniest guy lol putting his head forward at the line like his is some sprinter
Lamborghini cuz I will make it super charged.
Thoe really wow❤
Se dan çuenta que rico es el llegendario Porsche motor flat 3.8 6 cilindros traccion.integral LO MAXIMO, claro habran otros autos tunneados  o mayor cubicaje lo que sea, de chibolo moria x ferrari lambos jaguar aston.martin pero ahora basta con el.Porsche Mercedes BMW el Supra Lexus Honda Nissan GTR suficiente, me gusto video, sigue en alza Matt, saludos desde el Peru  !!!
Definitely lambo❤
Half amount of cylinders... Porsche: I don't care!  Warming up tires... Porsche: I don't care!
considering the porsche is down on power it did very well
Them cars can't handle all of that check engine light,tir pressure light
Didn’t know the 911 was that fast 😯
The Ferdinand Porsche took Ferrari and Lamborghini out of the way 🤣
Ferari
SF90 drops the SVJ...
Porsche is such a beast... Hope to have it in my garage someday!😉
Matt &Yanni it’s about time they learnt how to pronounce Porsche, not Porsch…
The Lamborghini
❤😂🎉😢😮😅😅😮😮😮😢😢
Yanny
Jeg elsker lamborghini
Yianni be a man and replace your batman for GS.
Definitely Porsche may not look as good other two cars but money wise speed traction brake is much better
Porsche are beast less power but a lot faster and is cheaper
Lambo sounds better
porsche any day
can we talk about the porsche it is the underdog
Hahaha I love yannis way of doing things 🤣
I'd probably go for the ferrrari 812 superfast, but i also know that I am missing out on amazing Germán engineering that comes from the 911 turbo s. Out of the 3 the ferrari would be my pick, but to be bruttaly honest the Porsche is just the better car out of all of them. But there is just nothing like a raw 6,5 liter italian v12 that is also made by one of the best car brand, ferrari!
Porsche all day every day
Porsche awesome, winning and being also the most usable as a daily
I got the Turbo S, not really feeling the Lambo flashyness...!! I got the better car!! I have an exhaust on it so it sounds better!! Amazing car!!
Loving the color matched seat belts!
I WOULD HAVE THE TURBO  H
Porsche just sounds the best🤤
I love wantching again again how porsche wins supercars)
The kind of race that i love. Wonderful cars, a lot of fun, and the winner is ..... PORSCHE . If i could choose only one i would take the 812 superfast (kid dream) . In real world i would be pleased to buy a 911 TURBO S. It is expensive but FERRARI maintenance is a nightmare.
The 812 superfast but with a twin turbo upgrade
Honestly carwow is the reason why Porsche stocks are high
5:23 Biggest jumpstart from Yanni I’ve seen yet😂 wheels spinning while the arms are still up🫠
The Porsche everyday
lose the stupid accent (especially German)
The porsche sounds like a queef quit taking the souls out of cars
Porsche won x 4
Ferrari
I think I would have the svj because it looks good and it is really loud and fast.
Despite the fact that I can't buy any of these cars...it's the ferrari man always ferrari!!
The porshe sounds like it’s farting on the ground
That’s the problem with Ferraris you buy them for £300 000 and after 5 seconds you need to scrap them
Porsche
Ferrari
Italians were racing and germans were waiting at finish line
Lamborghini all day every day
Porsche kind of a sleeper man 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 impressed
svj quickest gearbox for legal street cars
Porsche 911 Turbo S
911❤❤
I chose the Lamborghini  Aventador SVJ
Porsche the best ❤❤❤
Damn, a Turbo S for 156k. A lot can change in two years.
91
Porsche 🔝
lambo sounded best
Porsche is the only answer
Porsche is like Kimi Raikkonen in 2007: watch 'em fight, then swoop past for the title.
The porsche is like the quit kid u bully him it pulls out a gun
ultimae vs 812
In the roll race Porsche driver was sleeping. Theirs another car wow vid of a svj vs 911 turbo s and the Porsche beats it by half a car when both apply gas pedal at the same time
Lambo 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
And the Porsche is only a flat 6
Ferrari sounds better
No sound no problem
Lamborghini sound better
Without the proper tire pressure the car will not accelerate as designed
YIANNI😮
The 812 is much better looking than the svj
In ❤ with Porsche again and again
The 812 superfast is really living up to it's title❤
Porsche is in totally different league 😂😂
I can't understand why English people always mispronounce Porsche?!
Life doesn't end up after 1/4 mile.
The Supercar killer
lamborgini
W lambo
Porsche, ... there is no substitute
Ferrari🔥🔥
FERRARI
i  like the fact that the porch is that one npc thats fast for no reason
Love the intro and the 812
Porsche any day. Understated looks wise, doesn't look like a middle aged man in a midlife crises like the Ferrari and Lambo. Yanni is a sad man.
Lambo Sounds The Best 🔥
يكرهون سيارات المانيا شوف كيف ما يهتمون ولا كانو بورش معاهم يتسابق بس لمبرغيني و فراري
Porsche always Porsche Fastest with lowest power and least money Drive it all say every day never a problem The other two are just nowhere near The Boy Racer thinking the Lambo's the best just hasn't grown up yet AND he still can't say PORSCHE correctly It's a family name and they say PORSCHER just so you all know !
Best looking car by a mile with these 3 is the 911 turbo S.
these videos are made to spoil any expectation
Why everyone kills ferrari everytime 😂😂
Lamborghini Aventador 🔥🥵❤SVJ❤🎉
❤❤❤porsche
Never bet against a 911
porschaaaaaa
5:00 to 5:09 heavenly sound
the porsche is such a bang for your buck guau
Ferrari all day every day ❤
Frarai and lambo
Frarai
Porsch Porsch Porsch Porsch Porsch Porsch...
lambo rev❤
Ferrari for sure
porsche
The Porsche.......  Looking forward to buy it.
Porsche be like hold my beer
The Porsche OMG😍
Porsche all the way...all the time baby
outstanding
Porsche every day and twice on Sunday.
Turbos s all the way
Go Porsche!!!!!
wonderful
amazing
the Lamborghini got an early start
Porsche
look at that so called glorified beetle destroying ferrari and lamborghini😂
Germans🇩🇪 are producing flawless, exotic dream cars , but Italians 🇮🇹 are impossibly similar though.
Sorry I have to laugh again hahahaha hahahaha hahahaha
Anyone see yianni jump the start on the first drag race?
Porsche appeal to adults, while Ferrari and Lambo appeal to teenagers. Porsche make the best cars in the world
Hats off to the Engineers at Porsche,  really well manufactured piece of machinery. WoooW!!  The sound is crappy but i guess its a gentleman around all those hooligans...
LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR SVJ
YHANNI JUMPED IN THE LAMBO 100%. EASY TO SEE HIM MOVE BEFORE HER ARMS START TO MOVE DOWN.
Porsche there is no substitute!!!!!!! Best car ever ❤😂
The SVJ was louder sure, but the exhaust note on the Ferrari sounded better imo. Sounded like the crack of a whip
Nothing can beat a v12 especially in Sound
Yianni flooring the pedal to hell was 😂🔥
Porsche till I die ❤
Everytime I see this I can't understand how Porsche can do this
Italians were thinking they are in the game but suddenly germans took the crown 👑 😂
porsche
porsche
THE PORSCHE!!!! I LVOE PORSCHE/ SUCH A PRIZE OF A CAR!
For all out performance I’d take that Porsche. For looks and sound, the Ferrari Hands down takes the cake.
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Lamborghini jumped the start on the first race
Porshe is a masterpiece
The fact that Ferrari can be able to have a N/A V12 engine make 800 HP is nuts. Same thing for Lamborghini to put 770 HP in their N/A V12 too.
Ferrari always beats lambo though ..to be fair
Here I am back after 1 year to report the Lambo is old news and costs its owner a fortune.  The Ferrari sits in its garage all the time and goes "touring" 1 day a year!  Both Ferrari and Lambo owners sold to rich teenagers and now enjoy a 911.
I like the Porsche Turbo S best. I used to like the other two but Porsche is much more reliable in my experiences.
how pleasant is to watch a win of who you loveeeeeeeeee
Lambo
Wow the Porsche is a wonder what he does out of his power.
i think porsche designers has a secretly has a mission to  humiliate ferrari and lamborghini in these drag races
amazing
Ferrari looks better than svj imo
11:33 look at the Porsche Driver all smug. Like that :D :D
SVJ BABY!!!
Never judge a book by its cover
Lambo has 750 bhp and still loss to 911
Nichts geht über Porsche.
The Porsche
Ferrari ❤️‍🔥
Svj
Porsche ♨️🤍
Porsche 911 TUrbo S without a doubt!!!
I would choose porsche 911 turbo s my favourite car
Ferrari and lamborghini
The women is way more louder than the lambo
Porsche: TURBO POWERRRRR
My Dream Car I My Dream Is Porche
In terms of looks:  SVJ: 9,  812: 8,  911: 6  But, if it were my money, I'd spend it on the 911 anyway (if I could afford it)
i hope one day porsche enginers removes soft limiter
The fezza of course
I think Ferrari is the sound best team
It’s my car porche 911 turbo s great 🦾🫡🔥🦾
Porsche all day! ❤
I had to like the video because of his German impersonation
This germany cars bro😎
McLaren 765LT is better than Porsch 911 Turbo S. McLaren has 10.1 too.
Ferrari superfast holy shittt
Lambo
1) Downforce has entered this discussion 2)  this is the only YouTube channel that can't make lambos beat porsches 3) the lambo inherently has WHEY more downforce than either of those cars. It's meant to take corners at 200 km/h which the others can't even come close to performing for track roadholding and lateral Gs. 4) from the sound of that Lambo's exhaust, that is clearly on a stock exhaust which is very stifling, not natural for its engine due to limitations by law, and is not allowing its v12 to breathe or perform optimally.  There is also plenty of proof where there are several videos on YouTube of Lambos beating all the best Porsches - 911 Turbos, GT2, GT3  merely by putting a proper capristo exhaust or similar exhaust on the thing to allow it to perform ideally like an F1 car the way it's meant to be unleashed 5) the Porsche is a turbo, the Lambo is a naturally aspirated vehicle. The Porsche cannot beat to any times from that v12 with the proper exhaust, and furthermore cannot come close if the lambo was Turbo'd, even with all that downforce on the Lambo 6) none of the people on this channel know how to use launch control on the lambo, there is several steps. Corsa has to go on, esc goes off, left foot brake, right on gas for 4500 rpm hold, release left foot. 7) That Lambo aventador simply kills either of those two cars even with its single clutch.   Real auto purists know what the real car is here. It's the aventador Naturally Aspirated V12 with it's major downforce.
While the lambo is very loud during the sound test it sounds to much like it’s trying to imitate an f1 car. The porsche sounds like a vacuum as usual. The super fast easily wins this sound test in my opinion. It sounds amazing
Porsche the literal silent killer
Farrari
The way the lambo guy silent 8:56😭😭😭
The 911 is an MMA fighter who comes to a bout wearing a formal shirt, trouser and pair of Oxfords!
Dam that Porsche sounded sooo good XD
Yianni's reaction time🔥
Best carwow vid
ferrari or lambo? porsche. literally xd
i wnt the ferrari
best porsche ad ever. period.
7:34 Yanni got the win.
Porsche aka silent killer. Absolute beast of an engineering marvel.
That Ferrari launched phenomenally considering it's RWD
812 superfast  has the most torque Aventador svj has the most power but I vote 911 turbo s it has the least power and torque but still faster than those two cars
Lmabo in wrong hands
i would mostly go for Lamborghini STO or SVJ😄
That Porsche rips
iff i go with the looks ...Lamborgini ...Ferrari....porsche ...
Notice the Lambo slight jump start in the first race! He was moving before the lady folded down her arms.))
Getmany>Italy that is fact
Maybe you need 812 competizione
I'd still take the Ferrari
How in the world did the Porsche won??
The Ferrari, for me.
Porsche the great Respect to all cars
Only svj
Looks: Ferrari Speed: obviously Porche looks most like a douche: Lamborghini
I had absolutely no idea how fast that Porsche is! I thought it would be last. Daymn! 👏🏿👏🏿
The 911  sounds like its farting
I honestly don’t care what ppl say, a Ferrari as childhood was my dream.  Owning one will always have a smile in my face. That iconic yellow badged, black horse is iconic ❤
Lamborghini jumped on that race, look at it slowly
I have micro panda I'm poor
SVJ always,, no negotiation with that 😍😘🥹🥹
Ferrari 812 superfast i love it
The best sound was from the lamboghini
812 jumped the start second race
I will always be coming...for this moment 3:56
Aventador SVJ looks and sounds the best
in the 1st drag race the SVJ must've done better than 10.4 seconds because it was right up there with the porsche
Porsche is a better car 🚗 n terms of performance. Lamborghini literally is the best all round. Ferrari r boring to look at
I'm gonna buy that fucking Porsche
That ferrari looks fine af tho
THE SVJ IS BEST
Wow that porsche kept up with lambo!!!
i love porsche, but didn't expected to win due to hp, but it did quite impressive. Now i have more respect towards that engine. 😍
double the cylinders twice the falls
I want a new. BMW car x7
Jeg har porse
Porsche every single time
Piuttosto di comprare un auto elettrica mi faccio castrare !!!
Only reason the Lamborghini is losing is because they chose to keep that aggressive characteristic single clutch over a a more technologically advanced one. Common Lamborghini W
Lambo killing em all
Why is the guy in the Lamborghini taking his foot off the gas all the time that’s strange
100% ferrari looks the best
Lamborghini because I’m a Lamborghini boy
Ferrari 812 in black is incredible looking
No bull.
Razzle dazzle 🐷
Now we all just talk in emoji. Let's think of the compare..umm...👸

😉
Dear Adler ist Gelandet. Das ist gut, nein?
Too be quite frank, the "eagle has landed"; perhaps offer some real engineering 'suggestions'
Dear Alder ist engeldt
I would get the porsche as it's cheaper and better , and I will spend left over 100k pound for a world tour mate lol
Ferrari and lambo are for flash.  Porsche design is calm and quiet like it’s exhaust but definitely not a car you want to underestimate.
Why chose ? All of them !  But yeaa , I’m a lambo fan boy aha
Porsche
Ferrari sounded the best, and i'd take it over the other two any day. No one really bats an eye at a porsche where i live, plus im a bmw guy....so...no vw audi Porsche in my life., and as cool as lambos are, im not that cool yet. lol
Porsche 911 TurboS. German engineering as its best👍🏼
Porsche 911 turbo s is the only non supercar,that can bet any supercar on price , race and reliability
Name song??
Mat and yanni
I think we should all aspire to find someone who loves us as much as Yanni loves Lamborghini’s 😂
Lamborghini anyday, everyday
Porsche cayenne turbo
Everytime they ask to revv  the porsche 🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅, that revv limiter be Killen me
https://youtu.be/RurHZGQtbmg
Love you too 💕💌 your day is good morning 🌄 is good for us is the only reason horse races your house car look like should f*** you f*** you shopping shopping fuk fuk fuk can you  Just like I did I say hula blue I say
The better car What? In the circuit i wann see
German cars is always a surprise..that’s why i love them all ❤
I love  ferrari
Porsche!  Yo, Tom Cruise said it best.  "There is no substitute".  You can drive it anywhere and not look like a douche.  But, own the Italian fan boys.
Porsche is always the answer !
Ferrari on 🔥
Porsche...any day every day!!
Id still have the porsche
The Ferrari would be my choice. The Porsche is fast but basic and not exciting. The Lambo looks exactly like every other Lambo made since 2000 just with wings on wings with louvered louvers lol
Porsche always understated beauty unbeatable performance. Perfection
Si, tutto bello.. ma noi parliamo così da ubriachi, e neanche pure
Porsche 911 turbo s
Perhaps the specified weight of the Lamborghini (maby also the Ferrari) doesn't correspond to the truth.
If someone tells you that a Porsche 911 992 Turbo S has spits out 640Hp would you believe? Please be honest no lies here. That car has at least 750Hp or more 850Hp, I wonder why Porsche keeps lying to us about this car's Hp. Porsche please, let us know the true numbers next time 😃😃😃😃
Porsche was like come on kids stop making noise I’ve got a race to win!!
Porshe 👑
Great videos! Please learn how to properly pronounce Porsche
The porche it’s quiet rev
Absolutely crazy how that Porsche won it’s got literally have the engine size of the others
911
Turbo s!!!
I love this channel but the fact they never pronounce Porsche correctly bothers me to my core.
I would definitely choose the Porsche after that video
812 sf is the best looking of the 3 cars, and the best sounding aswell
i have 2014 turbo s. awesome.  new one even better and will always be the car to beat
That Ferrari is SO SEXY but Porche drives better therefore Porche
I would rather have a Porsche because my mom works for porsche
Porsche is two silebles
911 turbo s, great value for money and best of the best 👍
Lamborghini is best
holding down gas, such skill.
Porsche use speed to silence the Lambo
That German accent😂😂
Yanni pushes himself to apply one more extra horse power 😂
Lamborghini by far
Lamborghini for sure!!!!
Lamborghini second Ferrari third Porsche       I really like Lambo‘s but I have a Ferrari shop near my house so I like Ferraris
porsche: who's the daddy now
Pov :you are trying to find comment that is not talking abot how amazing porsche is
Who drives Porsche?
Lamborghini svj.
man why is a porche 911 turbo going head to head with a Lamborghini aventador SVJ?  Is therre a secret porche aint telling us mate?
sick drag race mat
SVj
Them 911s must be more than 650 😂😂
991 definitely man
Doesn’t matter if Lambo loses again and again but that will remain my favourite…. 😌 but i donno why this kinda brutal sounds making car coming very slow…!! 🥴🤷🏽‍♂️
but does the prosche have top speed? didnt think so
Porsche doesn't sound good 😂😂 poor guys
when a cars to good that they start not comparing it to others
812 superfast
Lamborghini SVJ I would have
Porsche all the way!!!!!
lol 🤣🤣 opening vids are insane 🤣🤣
Can't believe that 4wd car lost to RWD Ferrari
ferrari v12😈
This is why im taking a Porsche over a lambo and ferrari
Love Matt’s content but let’s be honest, he was babying the 812 Superfast 😂 —————- Which is fair cause it’s someone car.
Ferrari but not in black
Everyday Porsche 😂
Porsche
Porsche
911 the supra of feauture feeling it
Id take the Porsche over both of those lol
I love the Porsche
Lamborghini SVJ
Ferrari is the horse that likes to chase and win
i would like lambo
lambaloon
Porshe, there is no substitute.
Porsche
Lol, Lambo without TwinTurbo
porsche
You did sound Italian 😂……loved the act
They got the wrong Porsche in this video - everybody knows the 956 is the best Porsche you can buy.  No need to use a cut price rebadged VW in this video.
Porsche 911 turbo s all day, every day!
porsche
I usually prefer the looks of Lamborghinis but that 812 is sexy af
Porsche is cheaper and Lamborghini is expensive
Svj twin turbo would be Awesome
Porsche rules!
Ultimae vs 812superfast
For beauty/the Ferrari...rowdy and loud/Lamborghini...boring looking but fast/Porsche
Power means nothing without good traction...well done 911😃
Vote 911 turbo s
I am generally a ferrari fan but i think lambo looks the best here- i will still take the Ferrari 812 . Although porsche is the fastest here— but what porsche😂
Iatlian cars steel the best😍
the lamborghini sounds the best
Waltuh Slow down in the Porsche waltuh
I'll take the Lambo, sell it, then buy the Ferrari and Porsche
Every comment in this video "porsche"
The fact nobody cares about the Porsche because they know it wins in every video
Turbo S😍
Lambo is my pick. Ferrari is far too elitist to who can buy what car and what you can do with it. Porsche is good, but I don't car for the style.
Porsche is the best
Fezzer all day man.
Porsche always the least powerful, costs half and always beats all💪💪💪
911 😍😍
Top Porsche
How can speak about Porsche ???  It's fire folks , hands up for this car !
t k t k vor 0 Sekunden Porsche.  the one and Only. greez from Germany
Lambo
Whoa!! That 911!!
I’d have the 911 turbo s
I like the ferrari
812 Superfast : Looks great Aventador SVJ : Sounds Great 911 Turbo S : Fast af.
812
I love Porsche.
911
porsche
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Porsche 911 I would buy
Moral of the story is buy the porsche
My dream car is svj it's my favorite cari want it it's so super loud
Ferrari in this case even though the Porsche is the better car in this video. But I actually like the look of this particular Ferrari
I will order the Ferrari
812
Lamborghini sounded the best
Porsche all day baby
Lamborghini
Just imagine the result with an 800 hp 911 porsche turbo 😱😱
Lambo ,all day every day
Porsche 911 turbo s 12:30
Money no object still have the Porsche 911 turbo s then go to ES motor with the money I'd saved ;)
The Ferrari sounded The best
They don't even care about the winner. They are arguing about who came in second. Love that german stuff.
Lambo. Of course.  Duh.
6:06 mhhh yes and no
Germany Italy sorry Lamborghini and Ferrari  but the Porsche well done brother but the Lamborghini looks the best by lots
911 best looking,  best performing,  fastest(pretty much every variable, esp track laps), and you can daily drive it.  Curious who gets best mpg?
911
I take a Porsche anytime. Great car looks good and can be use everyday plus a lot cheaper
turbo s
The Pagani Zonda cinque beats both cars... I tested the game that has the most accurate stats of the cinque... And a video where the Aventador accelerates from 0-348 And I didn't use nitrous in NFS hp, the cinque reached 200kmph first while the aventador was at 190kmph. The Zonda cinque HAS 669 HP,  HAS A RWD DRIVETRAIN AND HAS 6 GEARS. It was also a roadster version that I tested and roadster vehicles give no downforce
I think Ferrari can't win this battle because it is way more heavier than the Porsche and the svj
nice video😁
Ferrari sounded better in the revs, but Lamborghini sounded better at speed.
Porsche sounded best lol
i would have a svj with gintani exhaust
Turbo s it’s a way better car!
I can not believe my eyes Porsche beat both them
porsche 911 turbo s
Beast mode engaged for Yanni
Id take the 911! Or maybe the lambo and then sell it and buy 2 Porsches lol
Censored
You sound like Italian are you from Italy 🇮🇹🇮🇹🍝
i would have a 911 turbo s its look fast but in a weird way and it made it a sleeper i love the people who made the 911 turbo s because is so crazy that it can go that fast!
It’s impossible not to love Matt and Yianni
On road Ferrari never won，Porsche never lose
Ferrari need to warm up but Porsche just go
911 Porsche Turbo S, is fast!!!
i want Ferrariiiiiiii
I will take the Porsche every day.
The 812 super fast is basically a Batmobile
porsche
lambo
It's sucks that the Porsche gets shamed for sounding like that it's turbo so it's muffled with some aftermarket exhaust and some exhaust work they cand sound beautiful
Porsche...there is no substitute,
I would love to have lambo
Drag racing an AWD against RWD isnt really something, I hope to see a rwd Porche, a gt3rs gt2r might represent better
I’ll take the Porsche over any of the competitors
Anyone would blindly have that Porsche 911! Hats off Porsche!
Lambo way better. All porche crybabies can continue to cry.
TRUTH VW owns Porsche AND Lamborghini 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Porsche for the win but that Lambo sounded amazing
silent killer porsche!
Porsche is just a humble beast
Lambo SVJ
The sound of 812 ıs best
That superfast has 800 hp stock = 340 km/h
No that Lamborghini does not sound better than the Ferrari 💀
That 911 Turbo S is a devil diabolik car! That 800 nms of tourque and 650bhp woth more than the Superfast 800bhp 717nms and 770bhp and 720nms of Lambo.
Lambo and ferrari have slow trans, porsche PDK is years ahead
I'm taking the Porsche
I’m italian
"That Ferrari moves like a panda" had me  rolling
This is well produced so CREATIVE
Please do a classic Hatch Drag. Astra J VXR 🙏🙏🙏🏆 https://youtu.be/xvN8te9wmjI
0:00 In general, in all countries, the way the English speak is made fun of. Your imitation of Italians and Germans was a very nice and correct move. I'm from Turkey and even here people make fun of the British way of speaking, but I like the way the British talk 😄😄
Porsche being the cheapest and the fastest is awesome
I would love to be able to drive an 812 Superfast.
Ferrari
Matt is so funny 😂
Porsche 911 Turbo S🤩
Ferrari sounds better than the Lambo.
I'm gonna have to go with the svj..out of the three, I love the roar of the engine, plus, I think the svj would turn more heads.. beautiful car
The guy in the Porsche didn’t warm up its tyre. Cause he knew it wasn’t necessary
Definitely Porsche for me, but my Son says Lamborghini 🙄😆
The accent for Porsche it was amazing sounded like cristiano Ronaldo
Mat is going to win the ferrari have a 800hp
Let us talk about the lambo and the Ferrari considering that we all know what the porsche is all about 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The lambo loses mainly because of that Single clutch robotized manual it just takes too long to put in the next gear and loses time so... Yeah ik that gearbox is part of the lamborghini aventador but with a dual clutch auto it would have a way better chance against the porsche and Ferrari
Porsche says hahahahahaha women ☕
0:20 The Rock
Lamborghini svj
svj
FERRARI EZY
Less horse but just balls out.  Porsche rules.
If you just considered the design, however, 1- Ferrari 2- Lamborghini 3- Porsche in my opinion.
I would have the SVJ
The Audi sounds better.The SVJ
the 911 turbo s for sure, best car, and best looking
Ferrari 812 is my pick the 911 is wonderful! Lambo is not a car I find appealing @ all.
Definitely Ferrari
PORSCHEEEEEEEEEE ⚡⚡⚡⚡
Porsche is the best all super car.
Porsche looks like a normal car and yet it overcomes these two beasts , amazing German car 👏🏻
#lamboghni
The SVJ in this is a lot faster than other ones they’ve tested
Actually if they had longer road the Ferrari could beat the porche
I saw a 812 superfast in the usa a couple months ago
Super car killer.   Best platform ever made.
Getting my Turbo S this week so you know my vote.
Ferrari
Porsche all day! Shit I’d love the Cayenne turbo GT over the Lambo and Ferrari
ferrari the best
I feel bad for the Lambo with that driver
All but Porsche best❤
SVJ all day
The Porsche just smoked this Italian trash. And that with cold tires.
Porsche WOW , REALITY CHECK , FOR LOOKS AND SOUND , SUPER FAST ,
5:41 yes Yianni, the Porsche 😅😈
Svj
I think Porsche is littlefast kid that everyone underastimat.
"Never judge a book by it's cover, PERIOD"!!!......
I wold have the ferrari
lambogini is more good
ferrai sound better
I think most of us will agree at minute 4:01 at his reaction. The sound it's just incredible.
Ferrari 812 GTS😍
812 and Porsche
Porsche 911 turbo \ KING \ best by far \ imagine 911 turbo with 800 hp from Porsche factory..., ... irrelevant competitors
People in the comments bashing the Italian cars for a quarter mile race, pathetic
Porsche😍
I like the lamborghinis sound.
911 turbo s
It's an 8 1 2 not an 8 12 (pronounced)
Don’t underestimate porsche because porsche is dad I am lucky person because m working in porsche
Porch
Lamborghini, Ferrari never porch’s I fucking suks
The porsche looks better in other colours imo
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
The title is drag race so clear the  Porsche 911 Turbo S is the winner BUT the lambo would be my choice for the look sound.
lambo dude be pushing the accelerator  through the floor ahahahahah
911, always and forever!
911 turbo s any day
ferarri is the best looking
Quella tedesca è maledettamente efficace, ah già pure Lamborghini è tedesca
Ferrari❤
All day every day Ferrari's
Ferrari
Lamborghini SVJ is the best car.
bullshit stops at 5:20
Bros really trying to compare a flex AWD Aventador vs a RWD Ferrari. Yeah wonder who’s gonna win. Aventador may be loud but it still loses. The louder your car the more your compensating
Porsche anyday everyday
Germans mekanica always the best ♥️
Svj
I rather have a scj
I rather have a sci
Ferrari better
lamborghini aventador svj
5:45 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Porsche all day everyday.  But i would be smart.  I would by the LAMBO.  Sell it and buy my a 911turbo s and 911 Gt3 rs.
Ferrari 💥
911 always
Lamborghini sounded better
The accents were really good! 🤣
lamburghini
I’d take the Porsche. Then the Ferrari then the Lambo. The Lambo doesn’t look great.
That 911 always amazes me.
Porsche all the WAY
Lamborghini was wow yianni let's go
Lamborghini I'm sure would have won, but weight makes a difference. All weight in the car.
The camera positioning is horrible, when Lamborghini gave a zero it didn't show up..
Ferrari V12 Sound ♥️🇮🇹🍀😍
V12 NA. Ferrari’s and V12 NA. Lamborghini’s ,6 cylinder twin turbocharged Porsche.
Definitely Porsche is fast but not to my taste. Both best sounding v12s
you Matt
porsche 911 turbo s is officialy now my dream car
I would have ferrari  (Glad you didn’t died)
Porchereerrrrrrrrrr ssssss hahahaha I knew ittt
porsche
Lambo is da best
porsche on top
Porsche all the way. You can actually actually drive it daily.
812 all day baby
I'm Germany so Porsche
I will have the Ferrari 812 Supa fast
My first supercar is going to be a Porsche 911 Turbo S
Ferrari
Lambo
German engineering is just different.
lamborghini is my dream car
The Lamborghini is so fast and my favorite car
Go Porsche 911!
Ferrari!!!
I think the Turbo S will win
The only race is for second whenever the Turbo S is involved
The porsche turbo s is my dream car i dont care about the other 2
Porsche...there is NO substitute...true then--still true now. Everything else is a distant second....    ;)
looks: Ferrari best performance: Porsche Hot Wheels car: Lambo
I think if the Lamborghini was black I'd take it but of these 3, I'd take the Ferrari. The Porsche seems the most practical, however.
Lambo
Ferrari 812 superfast
horse<bull<frog
Ferrari/ dream car
Porsche
Lamborghini
Lamborghini
The Porsche sounds the best 😘🤣🤣
The Lamborghini sounded the best
the porsche has got to be the best engineered car ever … costs half the price has half the engine capacity still smokes most stock supercars and doesn’t break down every month like the ferrari and bmw 😂
ferrari i would have
lambo
Germany💪
whats the name of that bearded guy in lambo?? looks desi and he always drives like a getaway driver lmao
Lamborghini lamborghini lamborghini lamborghini
Porch
I would have the lambo, sell it, buy a 911 turbo and keep the difference. 😁
These guys are so annoying.
Porsche
Porsche....nothing else matter 😎👍
Svj
Porsha Turbo I'd defo have the Porsha, It's got looks, White SVJ looks horrible, not a fan of completely black either.
🤣 yani you sick guy you mad man 🤣🤣🤣
porsche is the best always
Svj❤
Limbo looks best
GG to the porshe... but that 812 stole my heart
Porsche it’s the silent killer 🤣
and on the seccond go matt jumped the start
just noticed the porsche and the lambo jumped the start
The Porsche didn't sound well, but it was capable of getting the lambo and ferrari
100% why I prefer Porsches over Lamboghini & Ferarri
Lamborghini for sure ❤❤❤❤
its not how loud your motor is ,but how long your connecting rod is
Porsche is one of the Best Customised Car and the most powerful as you see the amount of the delivery torque. #1 PORSCHE
The price and performance.. Well Porsche wins in that way
I’m starting to hate the turbo s cuz it just fucks everything up 🤣
ferrari 812 is my dream car 🤤
Porsche
Did you people still Not Understand, that you can not beat a car Made by people in a Country without Speed limit?  Is cheper,is Not Loud as you want but it does the job  AND is everyday car. Ferrari and Lamborghini Not so Good for everyday driving  Liebe Grüße aus Deutschland
I love the porsche man its amazing its Till now my Fav car.
Ferrari
That porsche is crazy
svj with proper paintjob
Absolutely love the Porsche...what a beast
7:34 that helped a lot 😂
911 sounds like hair dryer.😂😂😂
The porche gear box is something else
Half the cylinder, double the speed
The Ferrari looks the best
Yanni really makes these videos so much better 😂
Comments are all about the Porsche! Just stop looking now.
always ferrari
Ferrari is a different experience. It can do better
Ferrari and Lamborghini cry 😢 vs porsche every race
911 turbo s don't try with it you will lose
El Porsche es el mejor auto deportivo de la historia.es el auto echo perfección.calidad diseño ingeniería. porsche is a number 1🇩🇪💪
Your german is perfect
The Porsche 911 turbo s is the best
Porsche
Lambo
Lamborghini aventador svj
Lamborghini
Lambs are so overrated. As well the price
The 911! No Italian trash for me...
Congrats to the Porsche, very nice!
The Lamborghini sounded the best
I'd still choose the Ferrari...It just looks so sexy
I would have the Porsche … by far.
Porsche with just 6 cylindres she can beat these italian v12🤣
I would only get the Porsche 🥹
Porsche is always victorious. Why compare it with others? You have to respect it and not put it in competitions with less powerful cars.
Resolution on that ferarri speedometer animation is quite poor.
Porsche have always had a superior way of translating HP to the wheels.
911 without a doubt
Super fast sounds best
Porsche every day!
Ferrari looks good to me. Perhaps it's the colour.
Porsche is like fart, silent but deadly
Porsche is the better looking car.
I think the second most important is the manual rolling race because that shows the real power of the car
Lamborghini
Never mess with quite kid Porsche
No one cared about the porch
Porsche any day of the week. Period. Better performance and that classy, bit old school look…
Bro that svj on the rev limiter🤤
Ayo tf. I'd choose the porsche over them for looks. Love its shape. Definitely better than the lambo imho.
Ferrari
Ferrari 812 super fast or the Porsche.. I don't know probably the Ferrari lol that's what I'd want.. I've always been a big fan of the 812 super fast but the new Porsches are amazing
Lamborghini is the best looking car, Porsche is the best car...
Turbo S
I’d have the turbo or the 812 all day
Ferrari has the perfect sweet point when it's come to looks and performance
Porsche has the best value
German engineering a la Porsche Turbo S. The best!
FERRARI
Porshe
Turbo S all day everyday of the week and twice on a Sunday, that thing is crazyyyy
Porsh
Silent but deadly 😎
For Lamborghini sound & big look are selling point. Where as for Porsche it’s pure performance!!!
I’m a Porsche person wasn’t expecting it to win but it did lol, Porsche is nicer
Porsche without a doubt I will have
Yeah but how is the cornering on the porsche?
Everyone is talking the talk  but only Porsche  is walking the talk.  Few years back Ferrari was fantasizing about their newest creation and the best sport car ever, the La Ferrar. Anouncing setting records and bla bla,  while the mclaren promised they will be better and faster than the la ferrari. Both were talking about setting new nordschleife records. Porsche came, invited them both and since none showed up they set a new record without showboating
Apparently you don’t need a v or a 12 to beat lambos and Ferrari’s just a porsche
Definitely the porsche is faster than them but the italians gives you an amazing feelibg about it... I prefer the ferrari
i world rather the porche
the performante done it in 10.4 so why an SVJ
812 superslow is very ferraish
Porsche keep the BHP at 650; imagine if they went to 750 or 800 and upped the torque.  Would be even more unstoppable. What a machine! Ti amo.
I think that's what makes cars so great. I love Porsches and out of the 3 I would totally have the 911 Turbo S, but for people NOT looking for that extra performance and just want their car to be pretty, great sounding and still dirty fast the italians are the ones for them. You just can't go wrong with any of them.
911 Turbo S all day everyday!!!!!
Not even Ferrari makes accurate tire pressure warning sensors
SVJ
Mantab coy
Porsche is crazy. Lambo make the best sounding craziest looking Cars.  Still take a ferrari though.
porsche all z way
I ll take that Porsche 911 turbo S over any supercar.
Lamboughini aventador svj
1st porsche ,2nd Ferrari
Porsche work silently
Ferrari is a bestt💖
hey nice fiat
Porsche all day 🙌
That Ferrari is just absolutely gorgeous
Well i think porche is a horse 🐎 too so the Bull 🐂 is beaten 😆
Conclusion: the 911 is good at the red light but not on the highway
Porsche 😍
Porche SBD!
Porsche all day. The other two are sexier but the 911 can be driven every day anywhere!
That Porsche just dominates every car in it's path.
I would like to have the Ferrari, please😂
German cars were, are and will always be the best!
Ferrari any day is my pick
Lamborghini sound the best
Ferrari
Svj is still best , change my mind
Porsche by speed and price
Porsche 911 turbo s 🥵🥵❤️🫡
Ferrari
911 turbo s all day
Like the way how he makes fun of the Porsche's sound 🤣 but its the quickest
I would go porsche anyday
I like how Matt butchered the Italian accent
seeing how everyone's dreaming of owning that 911.. then there's me who lives in Denmark with cars being over 150% more expensive
I'll buy Lamborghini aventador svj
Well I am sure she didn't take the ear cover for the porsche 😂
I would rather have the Ferrari
Porsche for the win. Probably the only one that won't live at the mechanics shop
Lamborghini
Lagu anak
Best looking is the Ferrari, best performing is obviously the Porsche. The SVJ does nothing for me, sorry Yanni.
the sound @7:13, absolute eargasm.
A12 I will have
Ferrari
Porsche 911 turbo s... amazing
Ferrari Ferraris loud
Porsche 911 Turbo S is deffinently the best in multiple ways only thing could be the sound
911's are the best
Porsche won cus no one was driving it which means Atleast 70kilos less prove me wrong 😂 💀
lamborgini
That Porsche is just masterpiece
Ferrari
🏎️💨 P O R S C H E ,  lomburgini ☕
That Porche is one of a kind it’s so fast off the line but I love the sound of that Lamborghini that Yianni is in great race over all 👍
Race against Porsche. When the race starts stillborn.
Do exhaust and stage 1 software on the porsche and it unlocks another 150hp on the wheels 😁
порше 911 против ферари против бугатти веерон против авентодора
Die Heart Fan Of Ferrari's So Ferrari All Day Long The Power And The Race Car Feel About Ferraris Is Out Of This World
Unfair to the Porsche... That race deserves a remake with the GT2 & 720S🙏🏾
Porsche is handing out Ass whoopings and lollipops..........     Porsche is all out of lollipops.
If I already own a Porsche than I'd go with the superfast
911
Awesome video!  I am surprised that you repeatedly pronounce Porsche as a one syllable word. Show more respect to this phenomenal car. It’s clearly the overall winner.  Porsche’s outstanding launch control allows you to do drag race starts all day long. What other high performance car can do that without overheating, or having a mechanical failure.  Again, love the video, but watch the YouTube video on how to pronounce Porsche, so you can start saying it correctly. 🤣
Ferrari
Porsche
911 allllll day
1. 911 has half the cylinders 6vs12.  2. It's half the price or even less than half.  3. Has least bhp among 3 on paper.  4. It has the most interior features.  5. 5X more reliable. 6. 3X more easy and comfortable to drive.  7. Has highest average gas mileage among 3.   and still manages to beat both of Italians easily on all the 3 tests😂. German engineering at its fu**ing best. Italians are all about swag, roar & dent on pocket. For track enthusiasts you have the GT3, good luck beating that beast on track. No doubt the best car out of the 3 is 911. The everyday perfected super car. period.
Without an iota of doubt.. Lambo..
I prefer ferrari
Porsche forever king!👑 👐hands down
Porsche forever king!👑 👐hands down
its only matter of time for Ferrari 812
I like the way Ferrari sound it the best
This is the reason why i love porche cars . These cars are silent killers..🤫🤫
Ferrari … 🤧
Svj
911 hands down
Porche 👑
FERRARI
Little does he know All those cars are Volkswagens
Porsche is killing it, at that price even. Definitely will be my first supercar.
Respect 911
eae ferrari sai do vacuo ae krlh
All three cars are unique in design and performance but if this were the Miss Universe (Exotic Motors Edition) there is a clear winner here without question. The Superfast, while unmistakably Ferrari, takes sophistication and blends it with the wild spirit of the prancing pony, and gives this black beauty a blue ribbon!  This of course is my own personal opinion and an argument can be made for all three and no one would be wrong! Love the Channel and hope for continued success as I would very much like to see much more in the future!
Porsche all day long.... 😍😍
The Porsche is basically a camera guy getting a front look for these two
Lambogini
Porshe is better
911 all day long🤗💪🏼💪🏼
I have porsche 911 turbo s
The Porsche sounds the best because you can't hear it. First thing I would do is take the turbo badges off it. Then go Ferrari hunting.
Lambo
Lamborghini SVJ
I'm taking the  911 Turbo S and with the rest of the money Taycan Turbo S and is still cheaper then the overrated S BJ  ahhaha
Porsche is strong on aerodynamics
Ferrari sounded the best
Nah that Porsche is something else 💀
Bro use drone its make your video more accurate and awesome......

Ferrari
Hahahah ciao bella (im italians
812 is 812. Ferrari winnig all competition
Porsche has a 6inline engine 3.8 and it fucks the other 2 like nothin
SVJ
ferrari: " lets see if your lambo sounds better"   lambo: *demon noises*

My mans with the lambo I just love his vibe he be on this cars emotionally
I will have all of them all that looks sick
Lamborghini and the Ferrari sound better
What good is the sound if you cant win the race!
I love ferarri!!id enjoy so much...
These three cars and McLaren 765lt are marvel engineering but the Porsche and mercedes are peak engineering head-to-head
Porsche . Will always be my fav. No.1 😏 you little rat Dont ever understimate porsche
Svj
with 650 hp shows that making super car is not all about the horsepower porsche isthe best  super car inthe world. the other only makes exaust sound
603 yeah yanni in denial the porsche won if yanni was in it and won u would never hear the end of it
this lambo to loud id much have a perfermonte
All of them are amazing cars, can't choose,  I'm torn
Farrai 812 gets
Svj
812 top speed 368kmh insane
911 Turbo S is very fast even though the sound is not too loud
Porsche Turbo S, for  the roll race nothing a little tune won’t be able to handle and that little rocket would miles ahead at launch and on the roll.  In addition the maintenance is far less costly, initial price is less and you have a super car that in case your one that cares about status it’s still a sign that you have arrived.  Just give me the performance and I’m happy.
Porsche 🤗
812 Super fast has higher acceleration than 911 Turbo S after 200km/h.
That Porsche is like that quiet girl in school that nobody wants but got the best pu**y 😆 🤣
Ok that's it!! I'm getting that Porsche!!
Svj all day
Porsche sounds best🤣🤣
Porsche is really amazing with the best cost. Wow!
Porsche goes silent 😂
Ferrari always sounds the best
I would choose the Porsche obviously! That thing is insanely fast!!
3.8 beating  v12's🤣
SVJ
ferrari 812
German engineering at its finest...
Porche is a horse
Definitely Porsche
Porsche built the engines for the King Tiger, for sure they‘re Chads.
Wow, nice surprise. 911 FTW!
Porsche without a doubt...
Ferraris always finish last, it's embarrassing
My Nonno and Nonna are from Italy and born
I would choose the lambo, it looks the best like yanny said
Beauftiully engineered Turbo S hands down. Inline 6 keeping up with v8s & 12s
never challenge a 911 turbo, its kickin ass
I would pick the Porsche 911 Turbo S anytime over the others. Die hard Porsche fan!
Yanni the maaaaaaannnn That Porsche sounds like a Dyson, that Lambo, wow!!!!
The SVJ sounds incredible in the fly by shots, I didn’t think Aventadors were as loud as that anymore.
992 turbo s
ferrari
Porsche was just chilling like , "you guys done smoking tyre's? Cause I'm about to smoke y'all"
Ferrari
P O R S C H E ♥️
Dad just bought the Porsche
The Porsche 911 Turbo S is both the best car, and the one that I will own.  But, the Ferrari looks the best.  Sorry, Ari 😎
Porsche sounds comfortable for the ears
the porshe
lamp just got the look it always lose races
Lambo twin turbo 1200 hp did the quarter mile in 8.9 against the 2011  f1 red bull car 9.2 and the skyline 1300 hp 9.3
Porsche is my favorite car
The Lamborghini is good
Svj for me 👹
the aventador svj
I'll rather go for the svj mate
I'll rather go for the svj mate
0:56...  But , you should catch a frame❗Ohh , his "beautiful eyes"... I like it❗❗❗
911 Turbo S is a killer
Ferrari
That Fuckin dude jumps every time. Worst driver I’ve seen in the tube
Porsche
Porsche still lacks top end performance, even the SVJ beat it...
Porche :- why am i so fast ? Why , i mean ..just why ????
🐴
The Lambo does look the best but I'd still pick the Ferrari if money was no object. But in red obviously.
Ferrari sound perfect
porsche 911 s
Mat: Should w talk about the Porsche  Yianni: No. Let's talk about the bull beating the horse  Me: Wich horse? The Porsche hase a horse on the logo to🤨
i would rather have the SVJ but to be honestly the turbo s is just a better car and i would rather have that as a daily
Lamborghini
911 Turbo S Just better
Lamborghini all day. Ferrari and Porsche are awesome cars as well though.
Porsche was like.. You wanna hear my sound.? Come closer baby. Oh oh..! No you can't come close.. Sad.. 🤣🤣
Mat and Yianni only cares about beating each other because they know the Porsche is winning
Ferrari, definitely Ferrari. The best sounding car here which I would like to have out of all three of them.
posche
mat watson
Aventador SVJ is my favorite
Lambo
The porsche 911 series cars are terribly well balanced.
I vote the porsche and its my dream car and i dont have money for it because my care is broken but i vote for the porsche
I would kill for the porsche 😂 Yeah i’m a German😅
Brain - Porsche Heart - Lamborghini
for the sound test pull up novitec
Lambo= all bark no bite. Porsche= silent assassin.
Porsh
i would do a tie  for the Ferrari and Lamborghini
Always the Porsche. That car will last for many years and needs hardly any maintenance. The other cars will be long gone in a junkyard.
Porsche SILENT BUT DEADLY😎
The Ferrari is beautiful, the Porsche is awesome and the Lambo is kind of vulgar.
The Porsche
Svj is lauder but 812 has cleanest sound
The $156K Porsche beat the $360K Lambo and the $262K Ferarri both combined $522K!? lol
Guys after Jeremy, James and Hamond, now you should do Top gear. 100% sure!
Ferrari only,Porsche is for wife,I’m ain’t driving it,I don’t wanna die in it, you know this 😂😂😂
When he said “killed the Ferrari tho “ I think not kidding ? 😂😂😂
the lamboghini is very loud though
normaly you need put gt2rs no tubo s
la ferrari reste le plus esthétique
The Lamborghini best looking car  my dream car also
lambo is the best
The Italian accent was quite good, the less said about the German the better
the porsche is made to win. italian cars are built to make the driver getting chills. you always need at least two of the cars.
lambo is have the loudest sond
Porsche is literally the bad ass of all time. Handing it to an Aventador. And in the end up it just sits there looking like a squashed VW bettle saying "You want some more?"
I actually like porches the most out of all, so I'll say Porsche, I like the fastest Porsche the Porsche 918, that thing does 2.2 seconds 0-60 lol but for what car I would take it's 10000% Porsche
Lambo
Aventador SVj I would buy
Porsche all day everyday.
Porsche
Lambo ❤️
Porsche is the most cheap and the fastest
812 wins in looks by far
Porsche 🤟🏾
I really don't like the look of the lambo! I would definitly have the Ferrari !
Lambo
where is third car man
Lambo
I miss yani in the new videos
With that belly, you aren't any kind of a sprinter mate.
Indonesian Cars.
When yianni said that moves like a panda. I laughed 😂
It's not another car it's the shadow of the two cars
Porsche all day
I find it funny that the Porsche still pulled away even though it has less power than the Ferrari
I choose the lambo each and everyday ❤
All time favourite 911 turbo s ♥️
Ferrari has the looks hands down. Those porches keep preforming 👍
I would like to have a Lamborghini
i would love the porshe though i'm a ferrari fan
You don't have to grit your teeth in a Porsche
Id deffo have the porsche
Svj
It’s unbelievable how this Porsche beats those extreme looking super cars, while remaining classy with it’s looks. Those Germans…
6:02 LMAOOO 🤣🤣🤣 bro i swear nothing can beat a 911
Ferrari
Has any car company had a more accurate slogan than "Porsche, there is no substitute."
Yo they got my fav car the svj
Definitely ferrari
its just a race between the Bull and the Horse bc the porsche is just out of this world
I would take the obvious choice - the Porsche. Sure, it’s not as sexy, however it’s better engineered, can be driven daily and you’re a lot less likely to wrap it around a pole pulling out of cars and coffee.
The Lambo looks great but it's too _bling_. The Ferrari is a little ( _little_ ) more understated.
I'd still have the Ferrari...
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Ferrari
What
My favourite is 812 super fast
PORSCHE the greatest sportscar on the planet .........
Svg for the sound and the porcha for the speed
Lamborghini aventador
Porsche 911
Ciao bella Macaroni spagetti capucino maradona
Porsche Turbo S never loses out !
if its between the ferrari and the lamborghini i probably have to go w the ferrari
porsche is quiet. but a performance beast
ferrari sounds better
Vw Win
It just was a race between Matt and yanni. The Porsche wasn’t even regarded because it was a safe win again 😂
Lamborghini won
Porsche, cause it's my favorite car 🚗
Fake anyway, but Porsche remains King
Matt always cool videos but get the  fuck out of the sun, even the British one
Porche 911 turbo s
I would have the Porsche
If at this planet is one the most jealousy man then it must be Yani🤪😜😋
Porsche
I’d have the Porsche ❤️ I just love them sry
911
Lamborghini sound is best but I like Ferrari
Porsche all day!
You can build a car for 30k that will smoke all of these
straight 6 beat both V's :)))))))))))))))) you don't mess with Porsche ! the Lambo is quarter mil £, for these money someone would buy 3 Porsche's and beat you with all 3 of them, 3 Porsche's in different colour so the lambo guy can have a pick which color he wants to lose from LOL (so funny). anyway...Thank you for the amazing video Matt, as always
Lambo's a death trap for me at least....
Turbo S!
Ill buy the 911 for a Daily car….  I will like to drive once the lambo
911
i own a f430 so im partial to ferrari BUT as impressive as the Porsche is…….it doesnt LOOK impressive…. thats supercar money to to be beyond supercar fast and look like a daily driver imo
Porsche 911 for sure
And this is why I’ve always loved the 911 turbo S, but my heart wants a GT2RS but the turbo S is a naughty little girl x
Made in Germany baby
Oh, I do like it when the underdog wins. Sure, the Lambo looks better, but the Italians would cost a fortune to service and I don't think I have ever seen a Ferrari without at least one thing wrong with it. The Porsche however would be comparatively cheap to service and would never break down.
You guys just fucking talking tooo much in the video instead of fulfilling the purpose of the video.
svj all day
I will buy Porsche after this
"I'm A Porsche With No Brakes" 😉
lambo
Yanni for sure
bro that ferrari is so slow of the line and that lambo is very fast off the line
lamb sounds the best and lambo is the best I think
um I am not a fan of frare but i like them o ya um the rare is ugly
Epic
I would choose porsche ....absolutely great
Based on looks Ferrari. Based on performance Porsche
Ever wonder why they increase hp so slowly over the years? I think it's because going all out gives them no room for next year's model.
Unexpectable win by Porsche 911 Turbo S! awesome Porsche
Porsche is soo underrated
Ferrari sounds the best
watch from 3.35mins
Taking the 812
ferrari anyday!! Forza Ferrari Always!!!!!!!
Second race mat jumped the start
That bloody Porsche... It should not be that fast. Germans put some secret magic hooh-hah in the Turbo S.
Porsche 911 turbo S!!!
don't underestimate the quite one👌
Lol 3,2, and u went first cheater. Gay Overrated Ferrari crap
Nice
It’s hard between the 812 and the super Veloce jota (SVJ)
Svj
Porsche is the best!
The small no sounding car wins lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This Porsche is f.....g quick..
PORSCHE FOR EVER
porsche is the best supercar ever
Lambo has more drag so thats why it lost in the drag race
ferrari 812 superfast look the best
Yanni is hands down the funniest person to watch race
SVJ!!!
5:27-5:29 THE MOST EPIC SOUND EVER😍  Also, I would rather have the Lamborghini!
That Porsche is just blaming quick 💥
two cars were for show and the one car was for business.
Ferrari 1000%
Imagine if the used the 2023 911 Turbo Lightweight that just came out…
Porsche the supercar killer🥳🏆👑
I will go for the Lamborghini Aventador SVj
The Porsche always the Porsche ❤️
Lamborghini Aventador svj
Lamborghini sound the best
🔥🌶PORSCHE! 🌶🔥
Porsche
ferrari or porsche
That Porsche is quiet and lethal coming from a V6. But it's more than that that thing has so much technology and engineering in it
And again, a Porsche with the lowest power beating Italian supercars...
Porsche is so expensive hehe I buy and sell
porsche sounds the best by far
You
Porsche
You can see how brutal is gear change in Lambo. Yanii is just shaking inside, creating kinetic energy that prevents the car from proper acceleration, lol
真ん中のランボルギーニ絶対フライング
The Lamborghini is the best looking car by far
Lamboo better looking by farr🫶🏻
FERRARI ofcours
the porsche
DragRace is not what super cars are build for.  SVJ first, then F13, then…
Ferrari then Porsche. The other thing is an Audi…
I would never in my life by a Lamborghini. I would probably even pick the Porsche over the Ferrari, just so I have a lil extra money to spend or tuning, and upgrading every lil bit on it to make it even more insane. but I would gladly take the Ferrari as well ^^
911 all day long
Lambo
The Ferrari 812 is a true GT and that Porsche 911 turbo S is the faster car and better braking. The Lambo is porn on wheels and a screamer😉
SVJ for sure😃
Porsche all day!!
I have to take the poursh
Sigma porsche
Porsche 911 turbo S any day
What car beat the Porsce Turbo S then??
My personal favourite Porsche 911 turbo S
Italian cars are shit.
The SVJ sounds the best it's just a fact
“I hope I won that” does he not realise it’s a three car race?
Porch Papa👊🏼
Ferrari won that sound test
Ferrari 812 looks the best but I'd pick the Porsche any day 💯
Yanni`s determination probably adds another 100hp on whatever he`s driving
Porsche for the Winn.
Ferrari
I will take that 911
Svj most definitely
Does anyone else think the ferrari looks like a modern day honda prelude? :) just me? OK...
Porsche half the cylinders and less power but kicking ass. The Ferrari and the Lamborghini are the dogs that bark, Porsche is the dog that Bits.
Porsche definitely worth the money. Others be like u got money u get it. Hope i get one someday.
Looks, Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini. Lambo's are just a wedge, with no real styling.
Id take the 812 no wuestion
That Porsche is insane , 120 to 200k cheaper and still much faster and calmer
C’mon! Oh-oh. Yanni never fails to amuse.
First one dead I love the noise of Ferraris and also Lamborghinis but I think the first one is best though
I will go with SVJ , cause it is sexy.
SVJ sounds best
Your British accent is spot on!!🤣
Looks for me got to Ferrari, and my first choice to buy from any European Car Company as well, but if I look at performance to Cost aka Bang for my buck, Gotta give it to the Porsche :) Actuially own a '87 944 :)
Ferrari looks nice blaxk
Lamborghini Aventador svj
Lambo
Lambo is the best
You might wanna try to let someone else drive the Ferrari and the result will change
The boys with their supercars  Me and my porsche
I’d take that Porsche any day!
Turbo s 😍😍😍
Ferari
The TDF version of the 812 would smoke the Lambo and the Porsche.
i think the porsche is the camera man lol
Ferrari sounds best 👌
obiously we would like to have a ferrari ,becoz that have a class
no no the accents where spot on :)
Matt always hard on the breaks when he uses the cars I know you need to replace the rotors and breaks after This guy lol
Avantador always 😁😁
SVJ all the way, it can be expensive yes, but its extremely rare, for me the most beautiful car in the world, in general there is something special that attracts me a lot about this car so I am definitely going eith that. The other two cars are very very beautiful as well but not that close
Porsche is the best
Porsche the best.
the SVJ🔥
Porsche 911
Not even close to an Italian 🤣🇮🇹
Now let me call the Porsche 911 turbo s Superfast and the Ferrari 812 a little bit fast
German engineering at its finest
ferrari all life
Porsche No.1!!!!!!!
Lamborghini svj
I repeat vids..and   this is #1
The Porsche is like Barry Sanders, never brags and all business, ready to make you look foolish
I watched this video more than once to see how badass the Porsche is and showing how slow the lambo is 😂🔥
Ferrari
Porsche
Ferrari is the most graceful and sophisticated, Lamborghini is the most aggressive and obnoxious(In a good way), and Porsche is the most refined and durable.
Ferrari
I will buy 911 Turbo S any day over Lambo and Ferrari
SVJ
Yannie is the most epic guy ever 🤣🤣
"The Porsh"
For sure a Porche 911 turbo s. Porche is a huge liar about HP and TQ numbers. And it costs a hell of a lot less.
Mat your prequles at the begining of the video were so good man!👌👏😂🙋‍♂️💙🇹🇷
Ferrari sounds like an enjoyable symphony while the Lamborghini sounds like annoying loud animal
I would rather have the Ferrari
I would have the ferrari
None of them can't afford anyone of those. I will still with my DSM and JDM.
I wood have the firari
i world pik ferari
ferari
Porsche turbo 650hp Ferrari V12 800hp Lamborghini V12 770hp
SVJ
SVJ or 812 or Turbo S
SVJ would probably win for half mile or full mile
Aventador is the crazy
Porsche is king but Lamborghini has a sick exhaust sound.
Of course Ferrari sound is better 😍😍
Porsche
the lambo
Tgis is the race which proved that Porsche is better than ferrari and Lambhorghini  German engineering>>>Italian
I get the automatic race but racing in eco mode is pointless.
Turbo 911 ahí humildemente...
Ferrari sounds the best.
I would take superfast
I'd take the Lamborghini.  Sell it,  and buy the Porsche, bank the rest.
Lamborghini sound is besttttttt
3,8 vs 6+ ... Porsche one love forever!
i would have 812 sf straight piped haha💥💥
So the Lambo is 200lbs lighter and has 100 extra HP than the Porsche how does it lose.
PORSCHE 911 TURBO S & NOTHING ELSE😍💪
I love to porcshe
What is faster than Porsches
Porsche all day long the other two are too "look at me"
Lamborghini aventador svj
Porsche beats anything
Amazing performance to the 911 👍🏿
Lambo
porsche😍🥵🔥🔥🔥🔥
Everyone saying that the Porsche has turbos so it has to beat them blah blah, if  the other cars are double the price and have more horse power with no turbos, that just means they're failures
Porsche sound: silent but deadly🤣🤣
Ferrari
That SVJ is in its own ballpark when it comes to looks and sound.  But my goodness, the 911 is an engineering marvel.
Porsche!!🎉🏆🥇 I’m sorry I love Porsche
Yes, the Porsche's exhaust is...lacking (one can option a "sport" exhaust for extra $$$, but it's never going to bust eardrums), however, as demonstrated, it still manages to hold its own against two V12 badass hypercars and it's ONLY 6 CYLINDERS, not to mention it's all-wheel drive. So, if I had $500K to spend and wanted a daily driver, I'm going with the Porsche (in "nothing to see here, folks" silver), as it's so ubiquitous and understated that no one gives it a second glance, which, for me, is important. People see a Ferarri or a Lamborghini and think, " Damn! That's a badass car..," and remember it, while I would know whilst I drive my 911 that I have massive power and all-wheel-drive safety. Kinda perfect, really.
Intro on point
Lambo
porsche has the best sound
Guys you are really dumb you should click the sound bottom in the porsche car in order for you to hear its sound
lambogihini svj sheeeeees
Porsche ALL day EVERY day!!
I would rather have the LAMBO HAMBO SAMBO NAMBO it 👀 insane 😅
Ferrari…
Ferrari 812 Superfast hands down in its most ferocious setting. That's the only way to drive it🇮🇹🏁🇮🇹🏁
Lambo😎
911
If I have one one as a daily it would definitely be the Porsche by a mile!  Other two says you’re trying too damn hard.
Svj
Definitely Porsche...
Ferrari 🤘🏻💯
Svj
Ferrari and lamborghini sound more butter
Porsche
Dud you should bring hoonicorn to this channel
The Ferrari is the best looking of those three.
Ferrari 812 super fast won the rev competition
lambogini
I have to say the lambo svj onestl
The Porsche is Soo Low profile
i would hav a ferrari
The Porsche just gets the job done. The other two are look at me, look at me rides.
i would honestly get a porsche, just with a better exhaust  and rev it in launch control as always
Lambo just needs 2 turbos to cope
Rubbish
To drive Ferrari one must have a mind of Enzo Ferrari . Everyone can't drive it like a Professional
Hehehe this races are already fixed . He Pushed Ferrari very lately
Porsche>Ferrari>Lambo
Always the 812 superfast
Porsche playing another game by itself 😂😂🤦🏻‍♂️😂
porsche is craaazzy
lambo
PORSCHE 🏎🏎🏎 l’Art de l’automobile 😎🍾🍾
I like how Yanni is not even paying attention to the Porche, just wants to smoke the Ferrari. He's just like we all know what the porche is about.
Fast 💨🚀 , but ugly Porsche can’t stand looking at them 😝 😂
812 All Day Anyday !!!!
no matar what svj is tha best
Lambo jumped the start baaaad hahah
Mamma mia quante ciaffate ..
The Porsche is just superior and the the Germans know it
Lamborghini aventador SVJ😍😍😍
Can we take a moment and admire how much the porsche pulls? Not just from a standstill...it has hundreds of hp less 🤣
Porsche is the better car. Ferrari is the better looking car (although it needs to be red). Lambo is the better look at my money car.
Germans just built different
Porsche 911 Turbo S, hands down
😂add Supra in this race 😂😂
I would have the 🐎 out of them
Want a drag. Of # Porshe 918
I under estimated the Porche lol
Loves porsche, 911 turbo S is like 959 in its era
ferari
Porshe sucks lambo pro
SuperFast!
Of the three the lambo is the more complete car. Better looks better sound I mean cmon
911
Lambo is insanely loud
Lambo is best
The Ferrari looks the best.
The Porsche is the most affordable and the quickest
AAYYAq@1Q kkk

Porsche
I’m a Porsche fanboy since 10yo. Such a pretty sleeper.
Hahah first joking about porsche but then lose all the time with italian bobycars  Im german by the way🇩🇪
porsche is sneezing

Heart: Ferrari Friends: Lamborghini Brain: Porsche Wallet: 1/64 hotwheels
In this video ...the laughs are very interesting😂
lamborghini
i would rather have a porsche because i am a fan of porcheses and mclarens
ferarri sounds peach!
Yianni when not racing: 🙂 Yianni when racing: 👹👹👹
lambo
svj
Porsche is pure engineering
That Porsche is sexy af! By far the best looking imo
Porsche is my Dream Car.
The 911 is my favorite.
I think Porsche is superior
The Porsche already has a turbo  I wonder what a 2000£ retuning would get out of it ? 2000£ on lambo or rari would probably not fix tire pressure problem 🤭
I'd have the porsche
Ferrari looks better
That Porsche is a spectacular feat of engineering
Ferrari for the raw scintillating sound. Porsche for the driving experience. Lambo to show my girth.
That 911 Turbo S though 😅 so underestimated. Ferrari is mint to look at but Porsche overall 👌
Lambo got a head start on the other two
Ferrari 812
😂 It probably won't make a difference,but I'd have the Ferrari 😎
5:30 " I'm gaining 😎😁,,, wait 😑 no I'm not 😐, I'm not doing anything😒"
go porsche 19
I would have the svj
Porsche all day everyday my dream car is a porsche 918 spyder now thats a beast
The lambo sounds   better
Lambo
911 TT all day
the sound of the 812's rev was beautiful
If the porsche had a better sound I might have taken the porsche
Porsche 911 all the wayyy
AVENTADOR SVJ
Porsche is the best of the three.
Could be maybe. But that same old body style, will always finish last in my opinion.
Ferrari of course!!! 😎 🏎
When money doesn't matter I would have the Ferrari as it just looks so stealthy and sleek like a toned down Batmobil. The SVJ is awesome, too, but I think for a daily it's too loud and flashy.
Porshe her türlü saplar geçer
Svj on top
Lamborghini SVJ
I would have lamborghini svj
911
Only Porsche 😎
The Porsche bullied the other cars
Porsche
tha got a fast lambo and porsche butt not a ferrari
Lamborghini sounds best no need to debate
The Porsche and the Ferrari that is the best the Ferrari the thing is it is a luxurious and the Porsche it is fast and quiet
For performance the porsche but for looks lamborgini.
I never understood how a flat 6 can beat a v8 and 12 ,maybe it’s the exceptional German engineering but like it puts out 150 hp less can someone explain how it wins all the time
If only that SVJ had a dual clutch...
Lamborghini
Porsche 911 Turbo
Yani on crack
SVJ ALWAYS ND FOREVER 💯
Porsche is No 1 super car and best selling in Thailand.
funny how Ferrari is the most pretencious, but the slowest. Sounds like an insecure car company LOL
There needs to be a better way to choose our leader other than first past the Porsche.
Porsche my family has owned 3 and I love porsches
lambo is the loudest
Superfast
i would have the Ferrari
Lambo
I would have the porsche
You should know better than to race a Porsche from a dig, that’s where it shines however top speed is another story, that’s where the other cars shine.
This proves your ambition matters not your cylinders 😂
The Porsche Turbo S is a car with an engine that has turbos Turbo engines have a lot of torque already in the rev range advantage of the turbo engine!
Both porked by the Porker.
Porsche for life
Porshce is the benchmark
I´d buy Ferrari, sounds best, looks awesome and it´s not so stupidly exoensive as Lambo.
Italian car its about show off and making noise .. and porsche its work smarter not harder
porsche is german car not italy
Enfaite la course c’est entre FF et Lambo car la Porsche leur met une belle raclée ! Vive Porsche ❤️
미친포르쉐
i am having porsche 911 turbo
Aventador
Porsche
I love Lamborghinis
I love you Porsche one of the best car in the world and very fast 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
id take the ferrari for looks but the porche for performance
you cannot use cars at the max power if you use automatic change on a Ferrari
That SVJ sounds insaaaaaaane!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Obviously ferrari
ferrari all the way
This 812 brings music out of the exhaust 🇮🇹 ITALIAN engineering 👑🔥
LETS GOOO BABBYYYY I WAS OFF MY SEAT WATCHING MY THE PORSCHE GOOO HAMMMM THATS MY WELL DESERVED DREAM CAR
The porche ower was a ghost😍
ferrari best
If we don't make eye contact with the Porsche, maybe no one will notice it always wins.
Nah man, that Porsche means business 🙆🏾‍♂️
Borshe 911 its the best!!!
Half price of the Porsche vs. Lambo/Ferrari. But both of them had NO chance to win. With 120 PS more... awesome car, the 992 Turbo S. One of a dozen reasons why I bought a Turbo S (Cabriolet). Best car I ever owned...
No man!!! The Lambo just needs more air...every other 12 Cyl motor is turboed...BMW, Merc, Audi, Bentley, RR,, u name them. It would actually climb to top world  7 fastest rides...4 midsize turbos and bat ears-a-la-diablo for the air-to-air coolers and an air-to-water system with airscoop down the middle a-la- Hurican for cooling both turbo oil and Air 2 Water intercooler...no meth! (How's my Italian?...what with all of dat "a-la-Diablo)😏🤣🤣 great show guys...Yiannis and Mat and mostly thanks to the guys who lend US, the viewer, their beloved cars.
There can only be 1(in a Lambo)...😏
Fisrt 3 races Porsches won! Sounds silent but, its fast! Who drives Posrche? Stig?
Ferrari without a doubt looks best!
Very disappointed with the SVJ and very impressed by the 911
Is it alle Stock?
Porsche: best sound, best dragster, best looking, best car in history.
Team lambo
Lamborghini for days
VOTE: Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
What Porsche did there was illegal
The Lamborghini has the biggest top speed
Porsche.
Porche anyday👌
I would rather have the Lamborghini
I would rather buy a Tesla over  a Lamborghini Aventador SVJ or a Ferrai 812 and a Porsche 911 turbo S
I think the Ferrari 812 sounds better
lambo
lambo sounds better
UWU
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
812 for sure.
porsche 911 turbo s will be mine choice.
I saw rare Lamborghini in the Philippines, and it is in the city. It's engine is noisy but may travel quickly than regular cars.
The guy driving the Porsche is the coldest dude in the world
Turbo s

Shut lol
I'll pick the Ferrari if they fix the tire pressure problem.madone
Go porch
Overall the 812 is faster than those and better look, but drag race 1/4 mile is The best Porsche!
Need a Tesla S Plaid in all these drag races. Just for perspective... Lol
I’d take the Porsche all day !!
svj
Farari
porsche smokes em up easy
lambo❤️
Hooligan 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love this ferrari
My dream porsche
Turbo S
GT2 RS is my dream spec
If I was forced to pick I’d say the Ferrari is the most beautiful, I’m not a huge fan of boxy super cars like the adventador, although the murcielago is one of my dream cars
I like more Porsche best car camera i don t never like lamborghini don t ferrari to i like more dodge hellcat srt 1000hp best car know
I would have like Lamborghini svj
i would have the ferrari 812
ferrari is the best looking
I want a porche
5:19
Ferrari
that Turbo S is from another planet🪐
Still rather the ferrari.
porsche is one quite kid but one speedy Frick god
Aventador sounded best by far
I'll have the Ferrari instead of the Lambo
i would have porsche dammm sureeee
I own and drive a black on black on black gt3 so i have to go with the Porsche. Everything i own is perfect 4 me, ho could i want a different car, it has the best clutch and gearbox in the entire world….
Them German engines just hit different, not the sexiest but just well built
The feel from SVJ is on another level. I mean just look at it and the way it sounds!
Porsche is better interior info system, more comfortable, it is cheaper  it is more reliable (in case you get in an accident or some malfunction happens, it is cheaper then the other 2 to repair), it is faster, looks more calmly, don't give the neighbors a reason to hate you 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The reason why the Ferrari almost beat the Lambo it’s because Matt did a little bit of a false start
I would buy a Lambo always
Lambo obviously sounds better than other😍😍
i have the 911 so 911😈
La 812Superfast e Aventador SVJ sono belle come due top model che fanno sembrare la Turbo S una nerd che pero scatta più veloce da fermo, ottima in quanto supercar quotidiana e miglior rapporto qualità/prezzo. Ma le due tigri italiane ruggiscono meglio in pista..penso non darebbero scampo alla Turbo S in quanto i V12 hanno un allungo e progressione maggiore. Ma la SVJ costa veramente troppo, persino 100k in più della 812 SF. Lambo tremendamente sexy ma non vale tutti quei soldi!
The Porsche is quicker, not faster. Jumping fast from 0 is not nothing, track race the Porsche stands no chance.
The Porsche 100%
Half the cylinder... drag race 🏁 🏎 👌 king
Yanni is a Lamborghini boy ❤ And that is so sweet 😅
Aventador svj
Yo bro I want yanni to win for some reason..
Porsche wins. I would go for it anyway
All these cars are amazing.
Lamborghini
Lamborgini
24/7 SVJ all day
The Lambo sounds insaane😬😬
Ferrari
Ferrari812
i hated to say  but the porche killed.both of you
Eventhough Ferrari lose but still love it especially with straight pipe Novitec exhaust and just sounds like an F1
porsche are all round the best cars in the world... stylish, super fast, luxuryous and monster techs.....
I continue to be absolutely blown away by the Turbo S.
812 jumped from the line in second race
That Ferrari is beautiful but the porshe just makes sense.
Lamborghini may not have won, but this car is an addiction
bro that porsche... german engineering, cant add much to that
I laughed so hard at Mat in the beginning 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
ferrari.
Yianni has a lot of enthusiasm!! Legend
Porsche  - hey why are you racing alone.. 🤣
911😊
The Ferrari sounds good
I recall teenagers here stating 'an Aventador would destroy any 911 turbo' a while back when the Porsche was spanking all the other junk Lambos.  Kids these days.
Ferrari looks nice 🦾🤩
Svj all the way
The german beating the bull and the 🐎
@carwow I have a race idea: Rimac vs F1 Car
Ferrari is better 😀
FERRARI
PORSCHE:  LOL lambo and ferrari
They should race a Lamborghini venano
Porsche is that one guy who is good in everything
Ferrari
Ferrari
I have the lamborghini
Porsche is a bully.
id have the ferrarri
Lambo
The fact that the Porsche being the least powerful car DESTROYED both the lambo and Ferrari just amazed me
ferrari
Just love FERRARI
The Lambo would have been my daily driver
The 911 is also the best looking car.
Porsche !
The Ferrari 812 Superfast in black with yellow brakes is the perfect batmobile, change my mind.
Lambo's sound is best
Or soju won the rev compatition
One of the best things in every video are yannies emotions
And that my friends is german engineering...
L
The Ferrari
That Porsche is the hero of the video.  No one talked about it...and it smashed the pair of them!
911 turbo s all the way
Porsche say "rawr" 🦖💓
I would have the Porsche no doubt about it
I bet the porsche driver is drinking coffee while driving.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RurHZGQtbmg
Nice
Svj
i go for porsche i just need paint jobs and good artistic skills and even the lambo and the ferrari guys will envy me
911...awd twinturbo
I would definitely go for a ferrari.....the name is enough 🙃
911 is my choice King 👑
Where are you form
Yianni jumped the first launch and Matt jumped the second
911 King.. thank you all german cars..love you
Good match
911
Lamborghini love you  yianni:love your show :Supercar Customiser
Of course I would go for the lambo
Because of this video, I have ordered a 911.
Numbers don't matter: Porsche Engineer
I would not have any of the cars because in a month the taxes would absolutely drain my bank account dry so i w rather get the newest Dacia Duster
that was fair i guess but i would like to see the porsche vs laferari
Porsche turbo S The Best! I love you Porsche ❤
the Lambo just to sell it and get a Porsche
I love Porsches
ferrari the best not 4x4 like the others but in the sportiest setting when it's already running its the best
Lamborghini svj
Fucking 6 zylinders destroyed 2 v12 and coast the half of the price a shame for italia
Now what if we slap 2 turbos on the Lambo? Assuming it doesn't catch on fire....
vaz 2110 turbo
The SVJ
Come on boys Porsche is winner.
Lamborghini always wins in the sound check no matter what
Ferrari best looking aswel
I feel sorry for that lambo on the limiter
A La Ferrari
Dosnt looks as good...say what?
The Ferrari is drop dead gorgeous 🖤💛😍
If that Ferrari had turbos it would have gapped that porsche in the drag race
lambo
812 for me please.
Vote : Porsche 911 turbo s
Porsche all day long regardless off the test 😜
https://youtu.be/OnKGKZK2nQU
There ain’t gonna b another car for the price of that Porsche thats gonna beat it pound for pound for automotive ability it’s the best car out there and from what I’ve seen just humbles much more powerful and expensive motors in these drag races
Y’all giving props to Porsche like this shocked you all 😂😂 it’s lil asf with awd power what you expect it’s a high end Miata
Lamborghini svj
A Ferrari tem mais final q todos
P O R S C H E
i'll take 911 turbo s :)
I like the 911 turbo s
What is "the Posch"?
Lamborghini Aventador svj 63
Boy is that porsche insane
911 all day long
PORSH"E"
Porshe fan boy here
We need laferrari drag races please
🐃
Bro did u just kick the Ferrari door open smh
Ferrari is the one maybe half a second slower but looks and sounds good
To be honest Lamborghini Aventador SVJ was the fastest one among the three  cars
Porsche sounds the best
svj
Lambo always
That porsche is not stock at all.
Definitely Porsche
Lol
In the first drag race the lambo was so much closer to the porsche .. i bet it did it in 10.3Sec & it lunches better in the first drag …. but typical mat always changes the right scores for himself & for the car he drives .. 👎🏻
yanni expression when hearing 911 sound is super hilarious!!hahahaha
Lamborghini's aventador driver is not a driver. He should not be here. Tell him to go and join a gocart race. That's what suits him. what an idiot.
Incredible 911. Not the strongest, not the lightest but smoke them all without a glorious sound. Performance is not all about weight and power, the technologie does really matter now.
Well, I'd still take the Ferrari or Lambo bro
Ferrari
Ferrari is the best looking GT car. Outstanding 💪
The 812 I think Is one of the nicest cars on the show, but to live with for the money and what u get, Porsche turbo s in metallic black all day long
10M views congrats
porsche is my dream car so i vote porsche
How is the Porsche doing this?
Lambo sounb the best
It's not the car but the driver!
None the Porsche GT3 RS or Porsche GT4 RS win for best track car of the year.
Agreed
lamborghini aventador svj won lol
I love Porsche
Porche 😀
Ferrari looks better
Porsche is just better
Perch
Porsche sound is greater the Lambo and super fast Ferrari 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
ferrariii
5:18 i realized mat actually look like.. spongebob
Just here for the sound of the ferarri dont mind me 🧍‍♂️
Ferrari V12 is a Symphony. Lamborghini is just Loud.
812 sounds better than SVJ, no contest
Yep panda Ferrari it is
I will take the Ferrari
Porsche gang:
911 all day…🥰
Mat and Yannis looking at each other battling hard... Walter in the Porsche: Hold my Beer
I would have had the SVJ
lamborghini looks the nicest. ferrari sounds the best. and porsche is the funniest to race with. so i think i would take the lamborghini because i cant stand how nice crazy it looks😍😍
Matha fckin svj
Cringe intro
Ferrari
Nothing better than a 911
Porsche 911 Turbo all the way!!!
Porsche is clearly the best
Lamborghini best looking for sure, Porsche just looks like a female car to me or an egg shaped, not the greatest looking outta the bunch but definitely the fastest, Ferrari is Ferrari sleek looking and beautiful.
If the 911 is 800 hp will fly by
91a
Hallo
loved the italian impression!! LOL
I'd love the Ferrari, it's fast, portable and have a great breaking system
Lamborghini has the best sound on the planet. And the best looking car.
This makes me proud to own a Porsche Macan Turbo 2016. I really love Porsche
Porsche darling, he is quiet can't rev but faster than other guys wow remarkable.
911……..what more you need to know
Sad the lambo can’t beat the porshe.
Lambo 360k?no thanks I will buy 2 Porsches
Mats German accent kinda sounds like Chris Eubank
Porsche 911 Turbo S  All day, any day
Ferarri I for looks porker for daily.
SVJ BABY
Porsche a class of it's own. We don't need to make noise, we just do.
"Superfast"
That rwd ferrari is........
The man in the SVJ is about the break the pedal. The way he drives is so weird.
Lambo
porschel
can you please make a video of comparison between porsche 911 turbo s vs mclaren 720s spider
Its funny how you guys were talking trash about the porsche and it almost won all the races
All day everyday the lambo no matter what I will always have Lambo love ❤️❤️
Lambo of course
911❤❤❤
that porsche is a total under dog, its crazyyyyyy that too stock
Porsche, no matter the sound
SVJ
when you guys gone learn... PORSCHE.. there is NO substitute
The Porsche. EVERY DAY!
Beautiful cars all, and what a lot of fun! Nice one. Ferrari all the way
No competition Porsche
Haha that intro is the best Matt
porsheee
That Ferrari looks so good!!!!
Everyone is gangster until the McLaren 765 lt comes...
I would have the aventador
First 19 seconds is the greatest introduction i have ever heard 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👏😭
U nailed the German accent 😂😂😂
I luv Porsche 🤍
I’m a Ferrari fan boy but geesh what are those Germans putting in that Porsche!
I love Porsche but 812 is best looking sportscar in the universe especially if it is convertible.for me
Did They just say the Porsche didn’t look good!!!?😂😂How?
the svj is toooooo loud
Ferrrrrrarrri
This video is absolutely unrealistic. They didn't manage to launch properly the Ferrari which is an absolute monster and road killer. It is by far the faster between the three, second Lamborghini, third place Porsche. Please learn how to launch supercars because here you are really giving a bad advice on which is the best car.
https://youtube.com/channel/UC8cXdQTn-bp0zTsa6Ot5EqQ
If  it's up to me = I'll took that grey thing from G !!! 🥰👍🤞🍀🏁
Mesmo o Porsche sendo 6 silindros, não dá para Lamborghini e Ferrari
the girl is so, so, so beautiful
Why are all Lambos so wheezy at the top end?!
My penis isn’t small enough to want a Lamborghini.
I'm going to lie mad but your car sounds very good but the Lamborghini sounds even better so say for say about the Porsche it's way too quiet so Lamborghini one that
I would have the Lamborghini svj
PORSCHE
Ferrari
Porsche 992 turbo S is a no nonsense driving machine! Low profile beast!
Proud owner of Porsche ❤️
Jaq
Onevillage quiet kid:Porsche   Onevillage class clown:Lambo
lamborghini  looks more better
Ciao bella
That “German” dialogue 🤣      “Ve Vill Crush Them”😂
Porsche is the superior overall vehicle.  It's quarter mile time is the best, and it is built to be an everyday driver.  I even like the fact that it is a quiet engine.
yea yos
lambo
I’d watched like 30 different videos with the 911 turbo and bro, this car it’s the future of engineering
🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪sublime german engineering 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
Money no object, 812.
Yanni: ooooh gotta get the porsche
I would also have that fucking porshe it is fast
the Lamborghini aventador sjv is the better car all out
Porshe destroyed u after talking deal to it about it's rev man that is sadly embarrassing lol But the lambo svj  killed it revving
lambo
Porsche is simply the best engineered and evolved car among practically all cars to have ever existed. This is the reason why it's the best value for money. I'd take it for a daily driver, and you'll still beat 95% of the cars on the track. Ferrari and Lambo are cars for people who need to compensate for something else, being loud and angry and all..
812 looks so good with all the long sweeping lines
Beauties 🔥
I'll have a Ferrari.
GERMAN AUTOMOTIVES IS ON WHOLE ANOTHER LEVEL
Ferrari Ideal sound lambo was too loud
Many on comments don't know that lambo have single clutch vs double on rest that's why huracan can also beat svj because of clutch difference
Let me state it this way, the lambo is a guy with a big penis that shouts about it but with a bad sex performance, it could only amaze with size, however the porsche is more of a silent playboy with an average penis doesn't talk about how good it is, it doesn't even care but the women like him. Guess what i choose...
Lamboooooo💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
Not even close, PORSCHE BEST LOOKING, BEST PERFORMACE, BEST RELIABILITY 😎
How many models do Ferarri and Lamborghini have to dream up to compete with the Turbo S ?  It's simple if you want to show off a ugly car buy the Lambo...If you want to show off a beautiful car buy the Ferarri. If you want to drive the quickest, fastest, best handling, funnest, most reliable, less maintenance, mans car, well u know!
For the price that Lamborghini is outdated and way overpriced
A hardly have enough to buy a Golf, but out of these three it's very simple. If you have the means and all and you're guided by emotion, who knows? Any of these three could be a good pick. Choose the one that speaks to your heart. On the other hand, if you're guided by rational thinking and (to a certain extent) price and results, then it becomes a no brainer. The Porsche is CERTAINLY the best choice.
I love the Ferarri Superfast.
Porsche-gas gas meme
I have a Porsche 918 spider Lamborghini SVJ and
svj
Turbo S will forever be the sleeper cell. I can't wait to have my own
SVJ
Lamborghini is the best !!!
Mat is not Ferari but FeRRari 🇮🇹  Duble R RRRRRRR 😜😜
When it comes to versions these cars Porsche is a win these cars aren't build perfectly for speed but when it comes to othe cars trust me, that Porsche is nothing
Lamborghini is never quicker than a Ferrari! Fact! Does matter who’s driving it. Sorry Matt
Honestly, I searched for Porche 911, soo ofc that's the car I'd like to have!
Best race ever!
Porsche 💪👍
Yianni always jumps the start
Porsche hands down
Lamborghini aventador svj is just beautiful
lambo svj
Svj
Porsche... No warm up, no noise but it kills everything...#SerialKiller
Wow I think the other cars loses energy when make sounds louder, so PORSCHE is more efficiency and faster.
Ferrari
Porsche 911 turbo s ❤❤❤
I'd have that Ferrari for sure
Lamborgini sounds better
Is not on rap videos and media as much as the Lambo and Ferrari but people…… let’s take a moment and show respect to a legendary masterpiece as the 911!! Wow!!! After watching this the 911 is in my dream list!! Amazing German power!!! Lambo is all design and Ferrari is being a disappointment in the last decade it shows on the F1 they can’t even catch a Honda power unit!!
Ferrari i will have see next time
Porsche running quietly while the grass eating mammals is screaming the shit out if them.
Everyone talks about Ferrari and Lambo but the real deal and beast is Porsche! Nothing is better than Porsche cars
Yanni literally gets so OVER excited. I swear, it must be a gherkin-size manhood thing. Has to "macho" it up.
porsche
812!!
Porsche
5:27 looking like a transformer’s scene😭
the  car that yanni had was 63 made
One question... how TF does a bull use horsepower...if its a bull...
I would have the svj, sell it, and buy the other two
Ferrari sounds the best
Someone help me buy porsche pls
2:04 are you looking at me?
and i would have the ferrari
ferrari sounds better by far
Porsche 👌👌
If i have plenty of money i would still buy the ferrari 812
911 turbo S! Remember that name!!
Regardless I love the Ferrari 😩
I'll go with the rarri when it comes to the sound
ferrari sounds better
the lamborghini looks meeeeaan
ferrari 812 best
Porsche
I'd have the Porsche
That Porsche is the underdog 😂
I prefer the 911. With those performances she’s the best
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Always!!🖤💯
I'll have Porsche 911 Turbo S
Porche all the way
lambo
Lambo!!
Im in love with that sound of v12 Ferrari, when it got novitec its sounds like brutal old F1 with v12
That Porsche is…whats the word? …. Better.
Porsche always wins
I would use porsche
Lambo jumped the line in the first race
F FARRARI
That lambo guy is so focused on winning 😂😂😂
10:59 no you won't die, and what's the risk for?? You have money too don't you
4:15 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can that intro be potentially racist??? PERHAPSS
Southern Europe style
porshe is a beast
Lmbo sounds best
King Porche 😂😂😂😂😂🥂✌️
Svj
Who won the race 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Porche
Ferrari ❤️
You have a good day!
Porsche does a great job being the camera car.
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Too much Bloody talking...
This is sacrilegious  but I would love to take that Porsche znd make a completely new body for it. No I'm not kidding.
Lamborghini sounded best but only because it was louder.
Lamborghini🙄
Porsche everyday...
The ferrari
i think the svj
Porsche to me the ultimate car is not pretentious its not a look at me car but its incredible fun to drive and well made
Moral:quiet kid is more than intelligent than shouting kid
Porsche is the better car, but the Ferrari looks best. Lambo sound the best though
The Porsche is the only 1 that is dependable. 0 shop time in its future!! By far better. New exhaust and it will dominate those two cars easily!! And badly, run off on them even!!
Porsche is the symbol of “Simply the best”
svj any day
💯👌
812!
Ferrari all day long
Both Lambo and Ferrari
Can’t believe the Ferrari weighs 262,000 pounds 🤯
Porshe
"nobody even looks at a porsche 911 Turbo S anymore, everyone just knows they will win"  🙂
Drag Race - Porsche won  Rolling Race - Ferrari won
I'd take the Ferrari, because every rich person buys Lambo's and Porsches
good video, but sorry i must go, i need to buy a ferrari
If money no object SVJ, but to live with the Porsche..
Lamboghini all day everyday
Porsche power
Lambo
I think the Ferrari and Lamborghini is my favourite
I'm year late but I take the Ferrari all day..
Porsche all day. That’s my future car… but in LHD.
812 is best looking
Those exhaust will be missed with electrification
ULTIMAE!  or a Turbo S...
Yan head going forward 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lamborghini
Ferrari always struck me as douchebag cars with no actual performance, mainly because of the buyers and drivers, comes to show I was right, porsche destroyed them by a huge distance
Ferrari rules
Porsche's story is so inspiring
Porsche sounds like my vw polo 😂
Porsche demeanor and sound reminds me so much of the Nissan GT-R
Ill definitely take the porsche, to me it looks way better than the lambo and ferrari
Porsche 100%, not even half the price of the lambo and still faster
Lambourghini Aventador sbj
Ferrari all day absolute monster 💪 on top end.
Ferrari
The porsche has less weight on its small so no surprise
Yanni common gives the car extra boost
Im a Ferrari fan but it was the lambo
That 911 Turbo S is something else! Well done Porsche. Hats off
It all depends on the driver 🤷🏻‍♂️
its crazy to me how great the 911 turbo s is, its like the standard for 1/4 mile
Porsche,Porsche Porsche,only an evoluated porsche is better than the other one
Sven
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Lambo
Porsche anyday on paper, actually that Farrari is gorgeous
911 all day
There is no Substitute!!
Why have the Turbo S go up against any other stock vehicle??? I mean it wins every single time
Hands down, the lambo won the sounds comparison🤣🤣
Always love the big V12 NA cars. There is no replacement to displacement. Hate the turbos
svj
I hate the sound of the new Aventador V12. I wish they would go back to making that car sound like the Lamborghini Countach that engine sounded like a cammed out dragster
Also Porsche und Lamborghini kommen aus dem selben Konzern.
The Porsche because I wouldn’t have to shell out a fortune over its lifespan to keep it rolling. …closer dealerships too.
Porsche
Ah yes, that Yanni jumping off the start again
svj
Lamborghini sounds best
Lool
Turbo S a fast car, but a turbo ferrari much faster. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUl9745d3mg
y dont u drive manual
The 911 looks better than Lamborghini and Ferrari
Yianni pushing with his head to the finish line is everything
Bring in the polls folks #carwow
German power with only 650ps
Novitec Super Fast 812 N-Largo the best ever car😍
I really one day hope to get the Porsche… it’s awesome
Amazing
Car of choice: Ferrari, Porsche and then Lamborghini. Love how the Porsche is destroying the competition, amazing car that is classed as the "everyday sports car"!
wow
If money wasn’t an issue I’d have all three Matt. Lol
I think the Porsche 911 Turbo S has more horsepower then what the manufacturer says.
that porsche is just that quiet kid in class
Lambo. Hands down.
Haha 😂 you should see  yianni's face when the Ferrari passes him
I looooove me some Yianni 😌😊😍😍
Svj bouncing off the rev is fkn choice
Porsche all day everyday my friends accept no substitute
If I could afford one and only one of those cars, my practical nature says Porsche. With that, I get the best performing car in drag racing, and all certainly on a track.
Can't wait for the top Lambo to get a good performance transmission.
Lambo sounds best, but the Ferrari is excellent too.
I would buy the lambo that the rwd of ferrari can cause me some drift-y issues while taking off with it :)))
Ferrari
Lamborghini
The Ferrari 812 Superfast and the Ferrari F12 TDF is my favorite car
carwow please do a feature on VW ARTEON
The Porsche!!!!!!!!!
Porsche.
Porsche for me
Porsche all the way
gonna go give my 992 a hug right now for being awesome love how they always act like theyres two cars they ignore the porsche its designated first from the get go
Sound: 1) Lamborghini 2) Ferrari 3) Porshe
Porsche
I WOULD RATHER HAVE THE FERRARI
this is a channel every teenage boy watches
Porsche just sits there thinking “you keep mouthing off guys…boom”
Looks lambo
Is anybody getting as bored with these as me??
You are always funny
Why is he lefting his feet during shifts like it's manual that's ur lost right there
🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹=🥱🥱🥱       🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪= 💪💪💪
i would definetly take the porsche 911 turbo s
"Let's talk about the Bull beating the Horse"  there is a horse in the PORSCHE logo....
those accents😂😂😂
Drag race at 5:20
Porche the king !!😎
911
always the 911 even though i don't like Volkswagen group
5:20 race start
I'd have the super fast but for the money the porch is obviously the best so I'd have a supra with the farari v12
Porsche 911 turbo s
Ferrari🤦🏻‍♂️
Anyone seeing this I’m an upcoming Car Spotter and would love some support
Porches 911 turbo S over any car no cap (except for other porche cars that are somehow faster)
In love with the 812 for sure!
911
Ferrari best look Porsche 911 the best car
911 sounds the best 😌
Oh yeah!  "Panda Eyes" CS panda yeah on the trafficked and raped children their eyes look like pandas.  Wonder if that's where the money comes from.  😡
Yianni souds like a v12 super car
Still,porsche is beast...period..fansy expensive italian
Porsche on top
I only care about speed around the track so I want the Porsche all the way.
Ferrari 812 Superfast, I’ve had the opportunity to drive all of them but will always be a Ferrari fan
Porsche gang Porsche gang ;)
Less than half price, less engine, less sound, no need to warm the tires. Just waiting for the signal with confidence, knowing he will win. PORSCHE ❤️
Porsche !
im so happy they had so much fun doing this and that yanimizze wasnt mad:)
Honestly i don’t care that the Porsche won almost everything at half the price, with those 2 by its side especially the SVJ, no one’s giving the Porsche a second glance
One built raceing cars one built tractors and one build both of those and tanks
Pretty good accents tbh
I will buy Porsche 992 turbo s
Lamborghini aventador svj sounds best if you ask me... Though Ferrari is a bit quiet.
prosche
i understand the porsche is quiet but i pick to have the porsche, even tho is quiet, and by the sound i pick the lambo
The 812 is a GT
All respect for porche
im taking the porsche
LMFAOOOOOOO THE ROAR
I’ll take the Porsche all day!
So Ferrari sounds the best is very fast and is front engine so so driving fun it’s the best
Moral.of story is buy a 150k porsche and destroy a 500k svj lol
People saying about the porsche " german engeneering"....bro , lamborghini is also german engeneering , it is owned by volkswagen and it has volkswagen engine.
Porsche 911 Turbo S any day.
Porsche
Only one car I would take over that Porsche 911, and that is a GT2 RS
812 superfast anyday of the week
Ferrari looks the best by far
Porsche
I would take the Ferrari 812 superfast
Man Ferrari vs Lamborghini a battle of sound 🤯 but Lambo is the best ❤️
The  "German ascent" juss kills me🤣🤣🤣😭
This is like football. Everybody else kicking around a ball for 90 minutes, then the Germans win.
Porsche 911 Turbo S
I like the Ferrari it look cool
I would have the porche
Ferrari 812 super fast ❤️😍
"i killed the ferrari though"......... lol
Porche as less power lol...Porsche ✌
Ill take the porsche
812 superfast is my faveourite
Imagine if Porche made a 800 HP car
Porsche all day, every day
Svj
911 again! Beast.
Lambo and Ferrari can't win the 911 turbo. Imagine what happened if put in a drag race, one 911 gt2. 😂😂😂
In Jamaica we have a saying that says silent river runs deep I think that goes for the Porsche😂
Ferrari is shit just like hilux and tesla below average
Ciao Bella
# Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Porsche😗♥
I think the best one is the Lamborghini
Mat jumped before the actual go sign in drag race.
Porsche destroy lambo and Ferrari  Nice Job Porsche!
Lambo
Ferari
I’m taking Ferrari on looks
Lambo
812 sounds incredible especially with a novitec exhaust
SVJ
I love that SVJ but wow the Porsche beat the others
Ferrari  is  the  best  👌  piece  of  art forza  italia brother

Porshe was like silent killer :D
amzing porsche💖
thats why hammond loves Porsche
honestly it was on point  italian and german accents
The 911 is the better car.
911 has always had nice acc
you are good at Italian
I would take the Porsche
812 sounds best
Svj
porsche really underrated one .
Lamborghini is the best
I'd have the Lamborghini aventado SVJ💣💣🔥🔥🔥🔥
Lamborghini   svj
Ferrari is ❤️ that V12 is so special it can't be described in words 😎
It has to irk Ferrari and Lamborghini beyond belief that Porsche absolutely blows them away.
Ferrari sounds better
Porsche rocks!
LAMBORGHINI, Yianni wins 🏆 all these
Yannis some shit he always jumps the start
Broo my guys were laughing at the porche😂😂😂
ill get lambo bro
Ferrari sounded best imo
Ferrari all day
Porsche ❤️
THAT LAMBORGHINI IS A MASTERPEACE 🇮🇹 🚘 👑🏆🌟✨
LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR SVJ IS . MONSTER
The Ferrari would be soooo much better looking with center locks!
The Ferrari definitely looks the best!!! By a million miles
Lambo
Lamborghini looks the best among the 3
i find both lambo and ferarri
Lambo all day
Turbo S.  No question!
Lamborghini is in "strada" ahahahah it should be "gara"
The race in which the thing called physics didn't work in anyway.
Ferrari 812
Can u put Buggati in races too please!!
Lamborghini sound the best
What’s cool about this video is the turbo is 1/4 mile champ the lambo gets to 1/2 mile faster and the 1 mile is the superfast now that is performance from three different companies and it shows!
Svjjjjjjjjjjj
HOW PORSCHE DOES THAT
PORSCHE = The only real car on planet!
F&L:😡 P:🙄
Definitely i will take the Porsche 👍👍
The lambo sounded quite good actually
s just
Deutsche Wertarbeit gewinnt.😎
Porsche diyir men gedirem gelersuz arxamca
Porshe all day
Mateo Watsoni.
I take the ferrari all day long
Porsche are built different like damn 😂
Mat can you do a race with a BMW M1000RR vs Lamborghini Aventador SVJ and a Ferrari GTC 4
Wow the Lamborghini looks the bettest
Ferrari 812 is the best
812 SUPER FAST
The Porsche
I’d take the aventador, sell it, then buy a Porsche 911 turbo s (the better car) and pocket the rest of the money bc that lambo is a waste of money
Porsche😏
The svj best sounding
Epic intro
The Porsche... Definitely the Porsche 😍
Would be better if the guy who always speaks try not to be funny because obviously it is not his job. Also cannot drive on the flat lane.
They need to make a uber limited special Turbo S (Warp Speed Edition or something to take a shot at Plaid with Tesla) before everything goes electric with like 1,000 hp. It would destroy everything on Earth and would pretty much be the final cherry on top for i.c.e.'s. Fuck it, they should put a machine gun in the front whilst they're at it. You'd have to pay 50k for it to be in silver knowing Porsche though. It would be a Da Vinci.
I would have the 812
Savage from the porsche, suck that sound🤣
The guy who owns the SVJ lives less than 5 minutes from me. He just bought a urus i’m pretty sure as well
Mat is acting like Mario when he was doing the intro
All time do porches best ❤️💪
Yani crazy hospital 🤣🤣🤣
porche obviously
The Porsche prob has 700hp underrated from the factory
I love the f12 the looks of that machine are insane mwaaa
Lambogin
id have the turbo s anyday 1000%. dream car right there
F
I like the Porsche I used to love when I was playing a game called driver San fransisco
turbo s
1.Svj 2 .Porsche Ferrari
I'll take the porsche and a 3 bedroom, 2 bath house
Yanni’s reactions are hilarious 😆..
Lambo ha better sound
Porsche has two more seats(though it's hardly usable), better fuel efficiency, faster acceleration than Ferrari and Lambo. Still my choice is Ferrari. That's the value of the badge.
The 812 superfast is my dream car
Ferrari ❤️❤️💪🏻💪🏻😊😊✔️✔️😇😇☺️☺️
Ferrari is the  is best
I  love it
That Lambo Shifts like Dogshit
This Porsche is unstoppable. It’s so fast
Ferrari
812 for me
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Ze German accent was super funny.
Porsche BOSSS 💙
Porsche!
do a video and speak only italian, do it with only italian cars
italiano perfettooooo
911 is that silent kid of every classroom
The Porsche is the most beautiful car ever made. I've always dreamed of owning one.
I think the lambo sounds the besr
Its little funny the fact that kind of a so quiet car rocks in every race!
Svj by far needs a better driver he win all time
I would have a svj and the svj sounds better
lambo
Lambo rules and Ferrari can’t beat it
The lambo
Porsche = pinnacle of German engineering  Good luck trying to beat that 🙄
If being an annoying bad taste show off is important buy the Lambo if you want a very expensive all talk no back it up car buy the Ferrari. If you want a car that out preforms  all and has pedigree of 60yrs of cutting edge understated good taste that will out last the others even as an investment buy the Porsche.
is there any car that can defeat the porshe
Ferrari
F
Ferrari
ferrar:aaaaaaaaaaaaa lambo:aaaaaaaaaa Porsche: i m in the race guys... and i destroy both of you O_o
Someone tell me I’m not the only one who’s classmate kept sending it to the class group chat🙈
Lamborghini is the best
Mikvarkar in 0
Mat what is you favourite car?
812
I take the Porsche german engineering all day
That Bloody Porsche is Silent but Deadly
That 812 is beautiful
LAMMMMMMBOOOOOO
Ficou claro que a 812 em uma Autobahn vai andar na frente
911
Porsche 911 Turbo S all day
Clear looking this a fake lamborghini aventdor svj
Ferrari sf
911 is a monster
Porsche all the way
Porsche, without doubt.
dual clutch car wasted 🤣
I think the ferrari sounds the best
Porsche turbo s all day mate
Great!  ;)   But you should drive a few laps on a racing track. And maybe some 0-100-0 test ?  None of the cars are built for drag racing....
Ferrari best sound
OMG! Porsche is INSANE!!! 🔥 Especially for the money!💲 I suppose that because Aventador lacks a modern dual clutch transmission....
ferrai
05:41 that reaction. Porsche is a sleeper...btw it has 3.8liters haahah
I love the svj
When Lambo roars.!!😼😼😼😎😎
Deutsche kraft man !!!! 💪💪💪💪💪
I love how Yianny puts her head to the front like a sprinter at the finish line LoL
911 turbo 💯👍
For show I'd have the lamborghini , for go the porsche every time . Or both if I could
Porsche 911 Turbo S...that car is all the way up💨..its compact ability its looks .. everything topping.
Best sound: ferrari The car to have: porsche, a classic style is never a excess like lambo for example... 6 cylinder boxer turbo has better fuel consumption! and I'm from Italy  🤫
the lambo
LAMBO FOR EVEEEERR
What is this porsche I mean In every video or race this cars just smash it's opponents
I think I'd take the German engineering of Porshe, it doesn't need to be too flashy, it is a classic. Based on its performance here, it seems to be happy asking, "Would you like to join me for lunch? Which of you should I eat first? No matter, I'll just have the buffet of you both."
The best car porsche and Im from libya 🇱🇾 😁✌️
Porsche, anyday
Ferrari Sounded better
the porche
Well, i think that every race should be better to change driver. Lamborrghini's driver is too weight. The other test driver are more light than him.
SVJJJJJ
Lamborghini
911 turbo S
Ferrari
Ferrari
I like svj and Ferrari sound the Porsche is not loud and svj is loud
Ferrari no Ferari 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Lamborghini no lamboghini 🤣🤣🤣
Hi mat i do not want to make you sad . But the 812 sounds great
Porshe is Porshe !!!!!
The Lambo looks the best, sounds the best, why did you pick the Ferrari in the first place, Matt? Lambo's are by far better!
The animals is in the svj
Is in the Lamborghini
Lamborghini
All 3 are on Pirelli tyres!
Porsche
lambo
Ferrari did sounds better
That Porsche is just a different breed
That 812 superfast is really fast.lol
Would take the Turbo S any day over the others
Depending who is driving
Porsche all the way. Won´t kill you, deafen you and win everything
Yanni’s mass is playing against him
Porsche was the best, that lambo wasn’t even close tbh
I'd definitely buy the porche,  it is thee better car here and always
Just buy a Porsche faster than new Lambo and Ferrari Wtf and it’s cheaper than Lambo and ferrari
I wish there was a way to cancel out the wiight difference between these cars and then see what the outcome would be. With even weight it would be Ferrai first, Lambo second, and Porsche third.
that all wheel drive is the only thing saving the lamb
The intro was elite
That 911 is insane
Porsche
Don't compete with German machine 😀
Lamborghini  is better rev
I would choose the Ferrari 812superfast
This vid made me subscribe
Porsche sounded the best 🥸
Ferrari the  king💪😎
Porsche
The lambo is for people that aren´t from west europe Way tho much,huracan is ok,would pick Audi R8 my self but that´s just me Porsche all day long
Everybody...warming up their tyres... Porsche in side - kids these days...
Lembogini
Porsche
no car messes with the german beasts MERCEDES And Porsche💪💪
I’m getting a Porsche
Get a Porsche they said. It will be fun they said
Lamborghini sounded the best
I'll take the porsche all day every day
I only come back to this video for those accents🤣🤣
Porsch
Just PORSCHE baby 😍😍👌👌
Im wondering if Yanni did not jump the start on the first run ;)…no?
for looks i would rather have the ferrari  but for speed its the porsche
You see the difference when the cars are in sporty mode noob porsche 😂
I like the Ferrari more casue is looks better and fast just the drag ti lost in
I would have the Porsche.
Holy fuck this Porsche just gabbed these super cars like it was nothing
Someone call 911
Ferrari ferrri 🏆🥇🪙🦁🤴
Porsche
I wish the tracks were longer
Aventador has worst acceleration but the best top speed
Who else keeps coming back to this amazing race from time to time?
I love the svj, I love that Ferrari even more, but you gotta admit, in general, the Turbo S is the better car.
Silent but deadly. Bad joke but hey. Gets the job done.
That Porsche, maaaan, what a car!
The 911 turbo s would be my choice
nice start to the vid
I’ve always been a Ferrari fan, but I’m honestly starting to like Porsche almost as much
911 all day errday
LAMBORGHINI 🚘 WOW THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL BEAST🏆🌟🔥😈 🇮🇹
German engineering is clearly the best in its category 🐐.....
I'd take the porsche hands down.
I would take the porsche 🔥🔥🔥
We've seen faster cars, better times, but for me, this is the best drag race they have done!
I would have HANDS DOWN the Ferrari. Simply because it a sexy beast that looks like a modern Batman car. The 911 Is boring 😴 and not many  would be able to tell the difference between a base to this. The Lambo, looks like a Lamborghini I have seen many times in Scottsdale AZ USA. But, that Ferrari, nope..  it's a eye catcher and shows in this video - Aside from Matt being the driver, a performer of a car.
Never bet against a Porsche. It's the perfect car.
Lamborghini is the best sond the best speed
Porsche 911 Turbo the ultimate and pyramid of all Car's. It is what it is.
Well, the moral of the story is don't underestimate the Silent.
porcodio
Lamborghini svj
I think the lamborghini svj wins the soudcheck.
🇩🇪🇩🇪Gut gemacht Porsche🇩🇪🇩🇪
Ferrari 812....very impressive.... Brilliant machine
I’d still take the Lambo!!
I’d take the Porsche, you just gave me another reason to love them
Fraty
Imagine driving the Porsche. Both other cars jump the start and you still win...
The bull beating the horse -Yianni
LET'S GO PORSCHE
So fucking proud to be german. This is Not eeeeeeven the top car of our Power Porsche House….the absolutely standart porsch…. Try fucking gt2 rs
the ferrari is a beauty, but........
6:54 Lamborghini is the cause of it all
4:39 definitely, Lambo
Porsche vs Nissan patrol from grand tour cmon
Lambo definitely did not sound better than an 812. They both sounded great but the 812 was the best 😎
I'm unstoppable, I'm a porche with no breaks ❤❤❤
Porsche all the way baby.
The Ferrari sound better they usually do
silent killer Porsche
svj
Don't play with a Porsche 911 Turbo - the beast!!!!! It's been there in the game. The king of 24h Le Mans too.
I don't even, bother watching the videos the first comment always ruins it
I would have a Lamborghini aventador
The superfast actually did really good considering it was the only rwd car there
Lamborghini is track toy, Ferrari is a super GT, and Porsche makes space ships 😂
Far
Porshe forever
That's german engineering for you
The Ferrari : beep beep beep beep beep beep
Yanny's "COMMONNNN"....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lamborghini svj
Porsche. Two syllables, dingus.
When did "loud" become synonymous with "fast?"
Lamborghini wins💪🏻
this youtube channel has 6.5M subscribers ~=10% of UK population -- those "top _UK_ car dealers" must be pretty loaded with orders
I think I'd take the Porsche because it fits me better and you can actually daily drive it.
Yeah PANDA 🐼 on the back of the plate.  You know what that stands for right?  It's when little Boyz have been Rapeddd their eyes turn black and blue like a Panda.  Is that what that's about?  Because I'd change the name if I were you.  😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Superfast : "My name says it all" SVJ : "My Soundtrack says it all" 911 : "Hold my beer, says it all"
I would have Lamborghini
Lamborghini sounds best
Porsche is epic
Nice Lamborghini
I Can't no Love that Porsche, I Love the Ferrari an all Black Ferrari for me is..not go there. But since I was very young I Loved Lambo. I knew what a Boss Mustang 429 Semi Hemi, a Dodge Viper GTSR and a Lamborghini Diablo SV looked like when I was 5. But Lambo is just one of those cars.
lambo any day
lamborgini svj
That svj is 10 best looking cars ever
Which one?! Are you for real?! SVJ all the way!
someone don't call 911...
I hate ferrari
And my favoritt is the svj
Can i buy cars even do im norwigian
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
I have to say I would have the 812 all day every day because  its fast and  loud sounds brilliant and looks overall amazing just the better car
But lambo is lamboooooooooo
always  a lambo
I would still choose the svj even though it's not the fastest 😏
loose that agreesive rear wing in the lambo.Lambo win easy
If I could only have one it would be the Horse but if I had the money, all three would come home with me.
Porsche is the #1 automobile. @Porsche
Ciao sono italiano 🇮🇹🍕🍝
The 911 Turbo S is the quickest, but I'd rather take the 812 or the SVJ all day just because they sound so awesome!
Don't know why, But I Just don't like the looks of Lamborghini, Maclaren/Ferrari over it if speaking about looks
Your Italian and German accent imitations are brilliant and hilarious
Bro always Team Lambo#lambo
812
911 all day bro
7:20 Never underestimate your rival
Porsche sounds the best 🤣
Long term: Porsche Short term: Ferrari Middle term: svj
Bevor you get the Porsche, you better have to buy an aftermarket exhaust
I'd have the "Porxa" 911 Turbo S by a mile. It's faster off the line, as fast in rolling races (much more potential for tuning), much more comfortable for daily driving and costs half of the others. A masterpiece.Tchachimmmmm
Ferrari
I wonder how porche able to do it what the secret behind it?
My all time favorite drag race
812
Porsch ❤ the German car💣
Lamborghini Aventedor SVJ oh what a sound!!!Love it!!!!❣️❣️❣️
4:57 that naturally aspirated v12 sound of lamborghini is the most satisfying sound ever in any 🤤😍🔥. Literally no other super car sounds better than Lamborghini 😍😍✌🏼🔥
Lamborghini svj
911 the most practical car among the 3. Not mentioning the fastest!😊.. I like the Lambo design though!
imagine what the LaFerrari would do to the svj
That 911 is no joke
Lamborgini svj
Only Porsche! Lambo is tacky. For show maybe, but it looks cheap
Lambo, no doubt
the 911 is sooo underrated
SVJ
The porsche. All day, every day.
By far the Porsche better than those aging dinosaurs
812 super fast
I would honestly have. The Porsche 911
Italiaaa
You're gringe worthy. Can't watch, unbearable
Lamborghini  sounds the BEST
What have they done with the 911???
Least funny Youtube carguy - Matt Watson... Please, stop his jokes... Somebody could get hurt...
The Porsche is basically just the camera man for them 😂😭
The porsche 911 should have been called the porsche 911 turbo super fast
that moved like a panda😂😂💀
I will pick the Ferrari every single time!
That Porsche is a bargin!
Lamborghini ❤️
To wstyd obydwie sporo mocniejsze V12 przegrywają - po porostu turbo robi mega robotę .
Great intro Matt 😂
Porsche 911 best car In everything i Would love to own 1 day
Porsche just went silent classmate mode
911 turbo s :*Eazy Peazy lemon squeezy*   M5 competition:Wait a minute..
Porche is my favourite I'll always go for porche
i would have the porsche 911 turbo s cuz i am a porsche fan boy
My fav the farrari. To be honest it was clos go being lambo but nah
I  LOVE  IT
NICE
Men if anyone says ferrari or lambo is better then 911 his a du*b a$$
That’s Ferrari showed the 911 who’s the rolling 👑, i feel the lambos trans hurts it.
911 turbo s is a silent killer, 👑
Porsche is annoying!!! Make the 911s sound nuts!! Not like a hybrid!! Gt3 rs sounds crazy, but common! It’s a turbo s!!! Give it some grunt!
id have the porsche 911 turbo s
if you want to smile a lot just get a 911 turbo!!!
The horse
ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 진짜 터보s 미쳤다 가슴이 웅장해진다
Porsche 911😻😻😻😻👍👍💪🥰
I'd rather ahve a Lamborghini Aventedor SVJ cause it's... cool.
my favorite car is the Porsche
Ferrari sounds best. Induction and exhaust...chef kiss.
44 degrees celsius is definitely too high...
The car I would rather have was definitely the 812 super fast that thing was quick in the rolling races.
Farrari is FARRARI BRO❣️🤯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
im 100% taking the Porsche
That porche stole my heart . It never disappoint..
Porche is a horse so the horse did beat the bull
Errrr to say nothing of what were jump starts by the Lambo…yet again..it’s the only way it ‘wins’…and /or Matt just dozin’…do you go when the hands are down?..or when they start to drop..or before Yanni 😂🤣😂
Porsche the beast
How is the Porsche beating the lambo when it weights more and has 120 less horsepower? Is it the drive train or some other engineering difference?
Hard to choose between the 812 and the Aventador. The Aventador is far more exotic looking and shifts are brutal as well as launch control. But I do like the sound of the 812. I'd choose both but if I had to pick only one maybe I'd pick the Aventador.
Lamborghini!
ferarri 812 is my favorite one
I don’t care about the speed, gimme that sexy Ferrari
Matt Watson 2020:hooligan
That lambo like a beast
porsche 911 tarbo s
SVJ is Power House 🔥
Porsche eryday
lambo jump the start on the first race
911turbo s
Take the Ferrari, sell it, then buy the Porsche, then pay off my mortgage
Ferrari
Svj
Porsch performance is great 👍 considering it a cheap one 🤔
The ferrari sound is very good
If money was no object, I'd take the lambo fs
I'd av the Ferrari all day and all night. I'd let it sleep in me bed
The lambo is like me in the school
Lambo is a beast of streets. 💀🔥
SVJ sounds the best of all cars
Porsche is the fastest and lightest car and cheapest but if you put and after market exhaust it barks!!!!
Ferrari wins all day with the revving.
Lamborghini aventador svj
Rwd car against 2 awd cars in a drag race, what did they expect lol
The Lamborghini is the clear winner of the sound check
I’d take the Ferrari any day over the others. The SVJ is just too boy racer and way overpriced and the Porsche is just boring. Suck it Yani!
I think with a DCT,the SVJ would win...
ferrari is the best and lambo is the worst
Porsche cos its cheaper
Svj
oh come on we don't talk like this pls, too much stereothypicals
Big respect for german cars 👏👏👏👏
Beautiful batman Rolex
Lambo lamborghini best your personal losers
Heart goes Lambo, brain goes Porsche
No wait it was Porsche who won not Ferrari Carwow
Ferrari is faster
I like this video🙂👍🦾
PORSCHE  ❤❤❤❤
Lamborghini
Lambo 4 me
Please do drag race of  Bugatti chiron 1500 hp vs nissan gtr tuned 1600 hp  Please  Your fan from india
Porche for sure
Porshe 911 turbo S with all the features and options
I would have the Porsche
id have the ferari even though it lost
Looking back at this video, I am impressed by the SVJ! It seemed to me to be the heaviest, but turned out to be the opposite! I think that a DCT would boost that thing so hard too! it had that porsche super close on that quarter mile, if only it had a lightweight DCT on it, it could've maybe won? but damn, that porsche is just quick.
Porsche: literal definition of underdog
Long run, Ferrari would win with stronger HP. Short, both cars with AWD and higher torque for sure.
You forgot to mention AWD on Lamborghini vs Ferrari's RWD.
WHY is the porche so silent
Porsche - there is no substitute
In the second race yianni goes come on and then he gets a straight face and says uh oh as the Ferrari and Porsche pass him
“Ferrari won’t loan their cars to me again because I disgraced them”, or Ferrari is so pretentious they spent more money on looks rather than performance.
Ferrari is the best
You guys didn't speak much about the Porsche.. it was clearly the winner
The porsche makes every super car look like a scam
porshe
LAMBORGHINI AVENTERDO SVJ  😍😍😍😍😍😍👽👽👽👽
At the start I was like: Is this a diffrent language carwow channel? And when I skip the start I’m like, oh he’s actually English still and died into laughter,                           Confusion moment
The Lamborghini SVJ sound was better✅✅
"We all know what the Porsche can do" Well, it's half the price, better looking, more fuel efficient, faster, and seats 4 so it's more practical. Sometimes you need to admit defeat.
It's PORSCHE. NOT FXCKING PORSCH.
Porsche is superior.
Porsche is best
lamborghini
Ferrari yes Sir
Nurburgring shows the real deal ;)
Hey rid of all the stickers and its lambo all day
Hey rid of all the stickers and its lambo all day
I love the 911
the turbo s is the true silent killer
Ferrari over Lamborghini all day, Porsche over both everyday
that... 10.4 seconds were most like 30.4... some Fast and the Furious shit going on here. I understand that this is for narrative porpoises but you should always include the REAL run and not those extended 30 seconds runs
Confusing them with silence , shocking them with  success
The ferrari I think was the best because it had tons of speed.
Porsche HANDS DOWN!
Porsche 911 Turbo S
favourite porsche 911 turbo s
Lamborghini
The ferrai becouse of that skin black custom paint
the lambogini has the best sound
is nobody gonna talk about the 812 superfast?
lambo all day
Next race Maserati Gran Turismo vs Porsche 911...
Porsche was the silent killer!!!!
The lesson is - damn this Ferrari is the masterpiece ! Whoever said that Porsche smoked those 2 and it's cool blah blah.. Ye it's cool car, really great! But this 812 is the RWD no turbos, and it's not made for stupid drag races. It's absolutely one of the best looking and fast cars ! GT3 is much more consistent car than this Turbo S.  It's all about the Ferrari though
Tht porche requires jcr exhaust
Porsh porsh and 100 times porsh
Yany started before hands were down
This is the best carwow drag race ever🙌. Just never gets old.
This race was basically Volkswagen vs Fiat.
The Ferrari sounded the best
LOL WHAT IS HE WEARING
911 Turbo. Most practical everyday car. Ferrari second.
I normally hate the looks of Porsche buuuuttttt….. the numbers don’t lie I’m sold on the vw group and Porsche in this case
I would prefer the Ferrari 812 Superfast but Porsche is very good according to the price
Lambo and ferrari all bark no bite.....  Porche...no bark....ALL BITE😲
Wow I love Porsche 911 turbo
it was ferrari vs lambo, porsche was just cruising
Svj
Ferrari sounds best
I do believe Yianni can jump these starts! And I'm a yianni fan.
Porsche 911 turbo S
4:57 is my favourite part
Mustang videos
Lamborghini sounded better
All this talk about the Porsche.   I enjoy and own a Porsche but, it wouldn't even be close if price wasn't a issue.  It would be Lamborghini (not in all the hideous liveries on thos channel), then the Ferrari (only in Corsa [Red]), then the Porsche.  The other two cars look and sound so much better. 0-60?   O-100?   That's for humans that can't afford them or have small
Go lambigini
That's Porsche is just a camera car
911
lambo
Would love the Porsche 4sure 😃 😊
Lamborghini sounds better 4SURE!!! BUT THAT PORSCHE IS SILENT AND DEADLY ALL THE TIME !!!! CAN NEVER BETAKING 4GRANTED!!!
I have a question. How have you the weight of cars ? You take it on constructor site ? Or you test yourself ? Ty
Did anyone else see that Yainni jumped the start and the Porsche still beat the svj
I really hate when he ignore the Porsche 911
ferrari sound maaad agressive
Ferrari
😎
when you come up with a fast car, the first association is a Porsche...Porsche is GOD !!!!
Lamborghini and Ferrari bacott doang gede Ama desain tajem kalah Amaa yang kalem Porche 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Not a Porsche fan but that thing is fast
Great video. ☺
FERRARİ
Porsche is the name of the game..
The Ferrari supra fast
Ferrari has the best sound of those 3
I would love to have a Porsche ♥
Frarey
Booooooo posh yayyyyyyyy frarey
Hurts when car guys cant pronounce PORSCHE right. 😉
Porsche is in the next level
Got a 2022 911 turbo s 😎
I would take the Porsche.
performance wise Porche , but with looks I'll go with 812 , I hate SVJ for some reason.
Lamborghini sound ❤️❤️
I would have the Lamborghini SVJ
Porsche engine is so well refined
812 superfast
I think lamborghini should start manufacturing tractors again !
Accent is sounded so silly.
porshe 😍 love it  ❤️
It warms my heart seeing how seriously Yianni takes this.
I would want the ferrari
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Lamborghini
Porsche. There is no substitute.
I would go Ferrari its smoother I don't like how sharp the Lambo is
Ferrari if money know object just because of that engine!!! But hard to look past that grey thing you know that will start everyday like a golf !!!
RACE THE LAFERRARI AGAINST THE SVJ
Black car
Turbo S for sureeee
i would have the ferrari
Ferrari all the way
Lambo for the sounds and look For speed definitely the turbo S For money I’d go for the maserati
Come on!….Uh oh 😂
Lamborghini aventador svj
allways Deutschland engineering⁉
1. Ferrari 812 Superfast 2. Lamborghini Aventador SVJ 3. the porche
Porsche for me even with no money objects
no strada, lambo nice performace corsa
LAMBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO🖤🖤🖤🖤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

12:03 ITALIAN BULLS WE UP! LAMBORGHINI IT IS MAT.
for those who don't know,  Italians also speak normal
that german porsche just f those two italians up
Aston Martin DBS would.be nice addition
Porsche or the Ferrari does it for me in this one.... but for the price.. the 911 is hands down the winner by a mile..
Porsche is just super amazing 🔥
6:18  The fact that yanni is congratulating the lambo for nearly drawing with the Porsche just BC they know how fast they are is just insane considering the lambo costs over 2 times the Porsche so u cant say yanni isn't a lambo fan boy
Lamborghini was the winner if mat was driver ❤️
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ (Lambos all day every day)
they talk too dang much i just wanna see the race sheeesh!
The Lambo Lambo YE
It's like 1david and the 2 goliaths
I will have porshe always
I take the Porsche because it can fly under the radar and not be noticed by cops as easily as a Lamborghini and a Ferrari The Rock Solid dependable unlike the Ferrari
911
porsche 911 turbo s
Ferrari
5:27 that's an orchestra for me
Call me crazy, but I'd still take a 993 Turbo S over the Lamborghini or Ferrari.  Just pure driving experience, no "driver aides" to get in the way of the fun.   What a great video though, in reality, the Turbo S is actually a wild car, but looks and sounds so sedate when compared to the SVJ and SuperFast!
Best investment for 2022: RAN on the ASX
Porsche
Porsche >Everything else. And to me it's definitely the best looking car and most comfortable too.
Lambo and Porche representing VAG group
Porsche for sure!!! It literally won every round almost.
At the first line the Lamb stole the start
Porsche is a better car. It's faster in a straight line, it's more comfortable, It got most luxury and features, it's more reliable and practical, but ferrari sounds better
Lamborghini
porche for sure
Ferrari
porsche sounded the best
that svj sounds amazing
Lambo won thee. Sound check
The Ferrari is the best looking car
Ferrari sound is best and ferrari is also best of all time.
farrari looks better
I would have Ferrari because Ferrari all day everyday
Io personalmente ti toglierei la Possibilita' di guidare ogni Auto sportiva e inparticolar modo le Auto Italiane dove trovi particolare gusto a farle perdere. Ma questo e' solo perche' tu o lo fai apposta o sei praticamente una PIPPA a Portare Supercar!!! Particolarmente quelle Italiane
Next time , we need to find a 991.2 GT2RS and F12TDF test with the Lambo SVJ
Ferrari v12
I'd still pick the Porsche: Reliability, Performance, Clean looks, it does it all
Honestly, how does Porsche do it!?
Yanny be like when he drives an svj: I LOVE THIS SVJ  then mat be like: Ayo i was playin tricks on ya And goin ez on ya  Then yanny be like in next race  What da hell is this svj pushing me back for!!!?!?!!?!?!?!?
porsche superior
i like the lambo svj a lot more than 812
The shifts in the svj are so violent Yanni sits on the edge of his butt to absorb the shock versus sitting back and having his spine jar about 😪
Lamborghini is an agricultural machine, the porsche is a recycled Beetle , only the ferrari is a CAR, i'll take one of them, then sell it and get a lotus or noble (if my near 6ft6 frame will fit)
I rather have a Lamborghini svj roadster
Porsche all day
بورش افضل سيارة معجزة المانيا لايحزمها شيء
lamabir
Can we talk about Yianni jumping the crap out of the start in that first race? Easily took off a half second early
ferrari
My vote: 1. The silver Porsche 911 2. The black FIAT Panda 3. The white ALFA ROMEO 145 Hahahahahaaa.....
812 all day!!!!!😍
Camoa
The Lamborghini won the sound check
all 3 bruh
We need to admit it, Germany 🇩🇪 engineering is the best
aventador svj
Porsche killing it but I'd take the 812 cause Ferrari
that ferrari sound is an art!
Sound - Lambo  Looks - Ferrari  Performance - Porsche
Porsche rules!
Lamborghini svj sounds the best
svj
Well done Porsche really well done👏👏👏💪🏻
F
Lambo launched very nice and noicy
Ofc lambo svj
how did the Porsche win with 150 LESS horsepower!
me owning the Ferrari and the Porsche + 3 other sports cars at my house
Lamdo
Imagine a Gt2 rs in the place of 911 turbo S....
The Ferrari 812 Super Fast has a chance.
V12 Ferrari 🇮🇹🍀❤️🏎️ dat sound !!
I would have the ferrari
I'd have the 911 hands down.  Price and value and the speed.  Incredible.  And it's not even tuned!
"CS Panda" on the back of the Ferrari license plate.  That's Very Interesting, considering the link to Child Human trafficking.  It's being exposed.  You cannot stop it.
Surprisingly the sound of a car does not make the car very fast... Porsche
07:02................Mat cheating once again !!!!!!
Money no object it would still be the Porsche. It’s simply the best car.
i would have the porcshe trubo s
I want that 911 but I can only dream about it.
Porsche 911 turbo
9:42 call of duty zombies reference??
Damn that Porsche is fast lol
Did carwow used the Porsche GT2 RS yet or did I missed it? 🧐
In honesty, I just forget about the turbo S and focus on the others, Cause I'm just bored of knowing it'll gap em all the time,
812❤
That Porsche is pretty mental,the only supercar I’d consider buying if I won the lottery
frustrating.. so disappointed to lamborghini SVJ is latest model but same performance. latest price😞
The Ferrari is just stunning 😍 but I like performance and consistency 😁 so PORSCHE everyday ❤
Ferrari looks the sportiest with the long bonnet and the kind of car a younger person will drive. For some reason, I feel that Aventador and porsche give vibes that they are like cars middle aged people drive
lambo
nice italian and germen talking mat
I love these races you should get a Tesla roadster on
Porsche is silent but deadly
I swear Matt does these drags to wind yannin up ..
5:20
lambo
Literally all three of my dream cars holy shit
The Lamborghini SVJ sounds better
I don’t care I will always love Ferrari
911 all the way
Lamborghini  sounds good
to be fair i would actually buy the lambo even though porsche was fast and amazing but i am a lambo fan mate, lamborghini all day everyday
i would rather have the porsche 911 turbo s
Yianni's sole motive is to beat Mat in all races!🤣
the ferrari 812
svj
Porsche every day of the week
911 every single day.
Nothing sounds better than Ferrari in my opinion
Ferrari 812 KING!!!!!
german engeering
ferrari
I'm sorry but that Ferrari looks...ugh!
Lamborghini aventador svj is my dream car
Porshe 911 turbo s
911 is on next level
I love how the Porsche is just off doing its thing winning and not caring...
If I could have any of these cars, I would get the Lamborghini and sell it to buy a Porsche
A huge douche driving a lambo is perfect
Mat you sound the best
Super fast ? Not that fast
Well done Porsche… That’s made in Germany 🇩🇪
The reason Yani beat Matt in the first race is because he jumped the start. Does it all the time. Zzzzzzzzzzz
Idd have that 812 anyday
Porsche 👍 relatively cheap sports car and faster than Lamborghini and Ferrari
911 is the best car
I’m team Lamborghini but out of those two models I do prefer the Ferrari.
honestly im a porsche person but there no style so lambo
when he says "only 156,000 pounds" me over here ONLYYY WHAT
i would have 812 superfast cause my dream car is any ferrari
To be honest, Yianni was even louder than that SVJ 🤣
FERARRI OF COURSE
😂your impressions
I’d take the 911 turbo S all day everyday. Not because it’s cheaper but I’m a Porsche fan, oh plus the reliability over a Ferrari and Lamborghini is 10 times better…..
porsche on top baby
Only Porsche.....
Lambo sound is the best
vote is non   my vote is tesla
Porsche. All the way.
Porsche should gap the lambo and ferrari,  I'd still take a V12 though 😜
911 alweys is better but i like ferrari more 😁😁🤑🤑
I like the porsche 911 more than the other 2
Der Porsche hat ganz sachlich,  wie es sich gehört,  gewonnen
911
Porsh
The car that I'll have is a Lamborghini
Best looking car and sounding car is svj
I thought it could have be George Russell in the Lambo, because of the number 63
Hey Mat, I would choose the Aventador SVJ, sorry😜
911 turbo all day
This video is so brilliant because the 2 hosts are racing their italian super cars with loud exhausts not even acknowledging porsche constantly pulling ahead in each heat
812superfast is the best looking
Porsche all the way baby. The others are like spoiled kids with expensive stuff but no added value whatsoever
I loved it. It was very unexpected that the Porsche won. I thought the Lamborghini would win then the Ferrari then Porsche but it was completely different.
lambo
"Cause it will go viral if I die" 🤣
Yanni is hilarious - he REALLY wants to win races. Was rooting for the Ferrari because that 812 is my dream car but Porsche and lambo are rapido!
Lamborghini 💯
Ferrari 812
Ferrari!
Love that Ferrari my dream car
Lamborghini
Lambo SVJ✨
Porsche rocks for me...
What the heck is this Porsche 🤯
Hi Yani
porsche the best
The Ferrari sounded the best in my opinion
Power is useless without control                                                         ------- porsche 911
911
I'd take the Ferrari pls
The Lamborghini for sure, the look and sound are amazing #SpiderVenom33
I will take the Porsche every time.
did he do donuts in an AWD car??
Porsche, 4ever!
Porsche the great!!!
Why and how is the porch V6 faster than V12 lambo and ferrari ? Can someone explain 🤔
i'm italian :)
Porsche 911 turbo S and Nissan GTR are the monsters of the Racing World...
Porsche 911 Turbo S is the best car in the world
Chomu lol
911 turbo-S , PLEASE AND THANKS!!!😁🤣
911 any day
Lamborghini  boy fan
Ferrari
Lambo
Lamborghini
Imagine a porche v12
My brother, I like Jaguar and Range Rover, I don't like German and Italian cars, I'm from Algeria⁦🇩🇿⁩
Ferrari
I mean there is no point of wathing of course porche will win
Porsche by a mile
911 > everyone else
That Ferrari is beautiful
I would have the Lamborghini
Wow wow wow wow I love Lamborghini adventadors
C ca que j'adore chez porsche, son design, son bruit assez faible la rend si innoncente...qu'on s'attend rien, jusqu'a qu'on se rende compte du monstre que c'est
Porsche sounds the best.
Porsche be like : these kids 🤦‍♂😂
Porsche for racing lambo for sound and Ferrari for looks
ig porshe won the sound test matt
Ferrari 812 hands down ! Looks, sound and performance (even if it gets beaten by the Porsche..)
Lamborghini
the ferrari and the porsh
Porsche for the deal .  Ferrari for the win .  Lambo is something between both .
De Porsche sounds best
Just for the intro alone!
The svj did really good tbh
Porsche is very 💨
ferrari
I love the fact that, for all the noise and fury of the Lambo and Ferrari, the Porsche 911 is quietly doing Porsche 911 things and whipping their a$$es. And the Prosche driver must have been desperate to give Matt and Yanni some smugness as they argued about who was the first loser... Lambo wins the noise argument very day of the week.
XD
I can't lie wowcar has officially made me a Porsche fiend
Porsche ❤️
Porsche aşksın be
Sing paling murah paling banter 😁
Porsche 911 turbo
Lambo Said " Lets See " uuhhh Sound Is Better than All
I love Lamborghini
lamborghini aventador svj
the 812sf
Now i feel the Best is only Porsche ❤️
Wow Porsche 💪🏾
I'll take the Porsche
The porsche eats those cars for lunch
They totally skipped the Porsche from race 😂😂
The ferrari-😴 The lambo-😜😁 The porsche-😎💪😝  The porsche be like: Ok so imma head to lunch now bye!
911 for the win 💯
Porsche won again. Too easy.
The Lambo is the best in the world.
BUY PORSCHE. GOT IT.
You gotta give it to the Porche. It has 1/2 the engine compare both to the Ferrari and Lambo yet it has no problem off the line and top end.
😄😄😄
I’ll take the Ferrari
That accent, 👌
lamvorghini sounds better
We want new supra and new gtr and new lambo race
And the Porsche costs a lot less….what a quite beast.
In same coloŕs and all..obiously ferrari. The porsche do diference, but that design..is for ferrari, and soung a litlle better lambo than ferrari..porsche is better carrera gt in that.
I would have the Lexus LFA
I laughed way to much at that "fuck off" at 8:17
If money no object... Ferrari... If value shopping... hands down... Porsche...
El que menos ladra es el que más muerde.
mat with the accents😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
A porsche without soft limiter
Porsche
Ferrari
PORSCHE. AWESOME.
Lambo. Always #1
I would take that 8q2 anyday
812 best sounding
I actually like the exhaust of the ferrari more than the lambo.
911 but in blue or red
Money no object? 812 superfast. It sits so well on its wheels and big GT is my thing.
5:26 Yanni’s launch face combined with the fact that he barely fits in these cars is tremendous
That 812 😎
The Porsche all the way, porsche have been my dream car since 6 years old know I'm 43 still don't own one but still love them and one day I will get that dream
an 812 in red is my dream car
Which one? Porsche by far
Wow that Porsche burnt that ass
Porsche😁😁😁😁😁😁
Porsche
Lamborghini
Ferarri is the best looking. I'd have the Porsche hands down
911 turbos an  Ferrari 812 superfast
911 nr. 1
SVJ... Always
I would buy the Ferrari if I have the money but, I’ll take the Porsche because I don’t have the money.😎
dahm i want a fucking Porsche
If I am to be honest from the heart I think that the Porsche is way better looking than both of the cars.
Cheapest car winning.
Porsche Its like a silent Hitman Agent 47
F 812v sounds better, quality sound
Never will I get a Lamborghini anymore
Sorry that Porsche on a new level 💯
Haha... Porsche plays with them even with less HP
How to beat Porsche
Ferrari my love
Its always a race for second when there is a turbo Porsche on the strip
That youtube money😂
I like the Ferrari 812 superfast because when I grow up I'm going to buy a Ferrari 812 superfast and a Lambo Aventador SVJ
It doesn't matter all the comparisons... Ferrari is the best car ever
Even the person driving matters
Porsche the perfect german engineering at it’s best and maximum level 🤙🏾🖤
Porsche!
Porsche turbo S all day.
okay, ferrari looks the best, Yianni is just biased, because all 3 are pretty good and I like how the Ferrari looks, I'd get that if I could.
Lambo is the car version of the guido at a nightclub who has three gold chains and does blow in the bathroom.
No doubt only Lamborghini svj 😈
Porche all over . The best lookin and performance car so far
Superfast all day every day
Haha the bigmouth yelling Ferrari (jumpstarting), the yelling (jumpstarting) Lambo both with extra warm tires and the understatement quiet Porsche waiting at the starting line is killing them with a snap). It is so impressive and hilarious at the same time. Thumps up for german understatement.
es
the ferrari sounds the best
Imagine if the Porsche had 800hp
I will take Ferrari Looks, Lambo sound, Porsche performance in one car
812 keeping up with the svj from standstill and wins the rolling without awd or turbo, superfast isn’t a misnomer.
I’d take the Porsche any day of the week, and if someone gave me the Lambo or Ferrari, I’d sell them to get the Porsche.  The Lambo is fugly. Ferrari looks good, but the simplicity of the Porsche is perfection.
I love how they they don’t even acknowledge the Porsche because it destroys both of them
Lambo sounds best (ofc)
Ferrari ❤️❤️❤️
All three are awesome cars, but that 911 is just something off the start.
Money no object,  I would have all three :-)
7:01 matt jumped the start and u can see it when u play the video at 0.25x
the porsche just clapped the other two cars
Please do batle ferari laferari vs lamborgini huracan
If money wasn’t an object I’d buy the superfast
Porsche ❤️🤟🏽
😅😅😅
I don’t want to see the results of 3 of my favourite Supercars
Man that was so good I loved this video ❤️
I would take the Porsche over the two good looking car just to surprise some people what this little car can do
SVJ 😍😍😍
god that lambo gearbox is trash
8:55 look at yianni😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Super fast
I'd consider 812 superfast anyday! What a sheer piece of beauty.   IMO, Ferrari looks the best after Aston Martin
Porsche all day long!
Lamborghini svj
2 cars are show, 1 car is go.
Lammbo dae
The intro got me 😂😂
Turbo s for me☺
action speak louder than words
The ppp
I mean that Porsche is a beast
I have non of these
Porsche, hands down every time.  Next the Ferrari, last Lambo
Porsche !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yianni is a cheating bastard tho🤣
I would have the svj
ofcourse it will be Porsche.
The quit one in the room is always the loudest eyh
Obviously lambo
LAMBOOO
Comment section   Comments about the porsche: 100%  Comments about the porche engine: 100%  Comments about the porsche perfect manufacturing: 100%
Porsche all day. No much bragging. But does it's job when it has to...( Porsche is also a horse) Yani forgot about that 😆
people will say that porsche is the best but deep inside you know that the svj and the 812 is better
The Car from Stuttgart...
Ferrari
I would take the 812 over all of them all day!!! It looks awesome, it’s a frickin Ferrari, and it really pulls in the top end.
Lamborghini Svj and then sell it and buy the Porsche while still having good amount of money back :)
Svj
Porsche 911 Turbo S 2021 | The McLaren 600 LT | Ferrari F8 Spider | GTR | DUBAI SUPERCARS WITH PRICES https://youtu.be/nbsfV84afbU

Porsche 911!
Ok... Porsche's engine doesn't sound like the Italian ones but I really don't care! Sound means nothing sometimes 😉
812 superfast
Porsche does not need to flex!!!
I would have the porsche

porge
Porsche 😎😎😎😎🔥🔥🔥🔥🦊🦊🦊🦊🤣🤣🤣🤣
I LOVE YOU LAMBORGHINI
everytime iam lamboghini
The 911 Turbo will always be the pinnacle of the “everyday supercar”
Porsche taking them to Gapplebee's
Resumindo, Porsche superou todos da concorrência??, NISSAN GTR - AUDI R8 - FERRARI - LAMBORGHINI - todos? Nossa
PORSCHE ANYYYYY DAY.
다 보고나니, 포르쉐 광고였다
SVJ!!!! every time. Then Porsche or BMW M5 CS Then Fer..no no..NOT Ferrari.. boring!
I think your IT and D accents are quite good.
why the Porsche keep winning?
Lambo
8 12
Ferrari sounds little better but Lambo and Ferrari both is good
Yanni and Mat: THIS MEANS WAR!!   Porsche: *Don't mind me, I'm just handing out L's*
If he was on corsa mod the lambo gonna win
Ferrari all day everyday lambo:straight up from the trash bin porsche:same as lambo
Porche and Ferrari look way better than that lambo
Porsche
I like it
Yanni @ 7:15 😂 the panic !
I'd rather to have the 911TS
The Porsche won...  What a shocker.
COME ON COME ON COME ON COME ON COME ON COME ON COME ON
LAMBORGHINI ALL DAY EVERYDAY 💀
Lambo sounds pretty
lambo sounded waaayyy better imo
Won 2 dragraces 1 rolling race  1 brake test Costs 100 - 200£ less than the other cars.  Smeshed
The Porsche is the best car
These videos only prove one thing....... the twin turbo Porsche is the ultimate super car.
Lamborghini svj
The lambo sound and look just melts my heart
Only 911 Turbo S
In the second drag race, matt did jump the start right 😂
porsche ist natürlich immer die beste
Ferrari
You should learn how to drive a vehicle B4 you try and race it if your gonna represent the highest revered super car company in the World by collectors. Just a suggestion. If you race a lighter car with twin turbos it's power to weight + 2 turbos ?
Porsche burned all of them every round
Silent bud deadly Porsche is badass
I'd go 812 easy...
Amazing!!!
Lamborghini
mats sounded the best
porshe 911 turbo s. just love this thing
Lets discuss how good mat is at the italian accent 😅
Don't mess with the quiet kid.
aventador svj
OOFCOURCE ferrari sounds better lambo is just a waste of money
the slow one
i want the Ferrari 812
Yea the 812 sounds the best hands down
Lambo the beadt
It’s the Superfast for me !! How do you compare mid engine with a front engine anyways!?
Ferrari
That intro... I still watch it again and again🔥🔥🔥🔥
Porsche 911 turbo is a legend for a reason
Porsche alll the way 😂
Porsche : the silent beast 😈
"Well the Porsche did the standing quarter mile in 10.............." The very first sentence said everytime after a drag race is over
# 3.
It’s the silent ones u should always look out for 😌
Lambo
The Porsche is a car that mat  keeps underestimating and he pays dearly for it by collecting a beating
I want the Ferrari
Porsche al day evrey day
Porsche turbo s
Porsche ⚡️💪💖🔥🔥
Porsche
Porche
Lg
Lambo sounds the best
The 911 is the best
Ferrari = 800 PS Lamborghini = 770PS Warum kein Porsche GT2 RS mit 700PS???
Porsche King in every where and every place.❤
Guess Yiani is not borrowing cars from that friend again after that tire warming 😂
812
Porsche ❤
mat won that sound check
porsche 911 turbo s 😎 ferrari 812 😢 Lamborghini aventador SVJ 🤓   I chose porsche I love porsche
Bella la intro in Italiano

Aventador sounds best
Porsche 911🔥🌚
I would have the ferrari
911
اكثر ما يعجبني هو تكلم واتسون باللغة الايطالية وخاصة الالمانية 😆😂😂😄😄
Matt I absolutely love the Drag Races!! You make amazing content! Especially you and Yani. I love the humor!  I have one request. WHICH I know you can put together.  💯💯💯Tesla Model S Plaid vs 911 Turbo S❤️💯💯💯💯💯
Porsche for the win
I love lambo ❤️❤️❤️ lambo is love Love from India 💓
Lamborghini
V 12s vs a flat 6. That should teach the sheep who drool over an obnoxious  loud exhaust noise (Italian trademark) a lesson in advance auto technology. Why Italian sports cars have outlandish body styles and loud  exhaust is because the market target is the mindless sheep who only care about those two features.
Porsche is the cheapest and the most fastest of the bunch.
It shows that Porsche is the boss, because it is owned by Volkswagen.
Porsche is like the assassin's.
The lambo is by far the most beautifull car ever made. And the sound is amazing! to bad i cant affort it.
I love cars and all but damn the community surrounding it sometimes pisses me off honestly
Porchie
Great porsche'
The lambo sounds sooooo gooooooooooddddd
Porsche has Turbo.
Yiannimize is like me loving lamborghini aventurine svj,sv and s roadster and all lamborghini cars yooo
The Porsche 911 Turbo S is a Super car bargain, I'd get that one if I could only have 1 and option it to my liking. If money was no object I'd have all 3.
Crew-"We want a Front-camera View for our race of Lamborghini vs Ferrari!" Matt-"Let's add a Porsche in the Race....!!" Crew-"This will Work!! Thanks Matt!!"       😂😂😂😂😂
Porsche 911Turbo! #1
Porsche has got the best quarter mile because has only  got 650hp compared to 770/800hp and that = no spinning wheels , It has a 2 turbos , if you remove them that porsche will have a 370-380hp, on Nurburgring that porsche would be toasted, on a special drag race track it will be a another story xD
911
ferrari
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Better lolling car
Ferrari
That's why I love Porsche. it doesn't make so much noise, it just performs,
Saw the Porsche's face at break test haha gothim finally😅👌
The Definition Of Just Cuz It’s Loud Doesn’t Mean It’s Fast. 😂
Porsche faster from a standstill. But, the Porsche imo looks terrible. the f40 is beautiful but it sounds awful. The SVJ is boss but that wrap on it is awful.
I love all of them but that Ferrari is my favorite
Madein Germany  is Porsche
le italiane su questo canale perdono sempre....
Ferrari 812
farrari
I,d rather have a lamboghini
matt talking like thai😂
FARRAR3
Porsche all day long for me
Porsche all the way for me
I would never get the Porsche, my first option would be the Ferrari and then lambo but there are some lambo better than Ferrari
what were the times for each from 0-100kmh?
Did yanni duck his head at the line like a sprinter LMAO!!!
porsche #1 every time
The porch sound like a vacuum cleaner
Ferrari all day everyday 😬😍
Can we put the FERRARI SF 90 AGAINST THEM
porsche and lambo be like:we're ina lill bit hurry
Lamborghini Lamborghini Lamborghini Lamborghini Lamborghini Lamborghini Lamborghini Lamborghini Lamborghini Lamborghini Lamborghini
Porsche is king
Porsche……. NO SUBSTITUTE!!!!!!!!
Real talk  ugly ascent !    That Porsche   is killer of super car  what a  disgrace   for the two v12 supercar  expensive
Porsche 911 Turbo S
the lambo sounds the best
Loving Porsche
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ coupe is my dream car
Lamborghini always wins the sound checks! They are invincible.
Lamborghini army🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Svj
Ferrari
Lamborghini
Do lambos usually have better acceleration than ferraris
The Italian sound was just amazing
911 every time. Love the way the Lamborghini and Ferrari look but looks aren’t everything.
The porsche put the lambo to shame ngl
Pors von 😂
Never judge a car by its roaring sound😌
Ferrari because it has that high pitched v12 sound
Porsche 911 might sound like an electric vaccum, but that fucking vaccum is going to wipe to floor with you 9 times over at half the cost
The Porsche looks much simple, less complicated than the other two cars yet beats the heck out of them. It most probably  beats both the Italian cars even on a circuit. ASTONISHING !
The Ferrari
Which car DO I own? Porsche (GT3 Cup R 4.2L) .
Why are most people talking about Porsche? It’s quick but so boring though… and ugly.
German power 😄😈
For sure 911 turbo its cheaper that the other two but faster and have got good brakes too
ferrari
Porshe is also the better looking car with a timeless design. Lamborghini looks like a bull trying to squeeze into a horse costume. The Ferrari? *shrugs*
Porsche 911 turbo 💕💕💗
LAMBO
911
SVJ….
Porsche
the lamberghini win
lambo is the best looking car fr
aventerdor is the loudest car
I definitely take the Porsche. Crap this is why Porsche started charging so much for the cars they're obviously the best
"this is al about the ferrari"  ...love that !!
Porsche
FERRARI  812
Porsche
Mat, in italian and youre italian accent its horrible🤣🤣 u so fan, Keep it up 💪🏻
Ferrari, Lambo…..then the beetle
Sorry  mat Lambo is better
Love Porsche
Porche
Ferrari 🐎
Everyone is gangsta until porsche takes it seriously 😒
Looks like the lambo got a head start
Ferrari
SVJ jumped the start at the first drag race.
I torn between the Ferrari and the Porsche.
The Porsche would be the best racer and the lambow
To be honest the pro he has performance but not the looks
svj
Ferrari
is it "I'm Saturn" or "I'm satin" as in the fabric?
Ferrari i i would buy
Lmap swear 911 s underrated lol
Lmap obvi love when in-line 6 twins smack the v8 v10 v12 lolol
Can anyone pls explain his Porsche is soo FAST?..... my lambo ego is hurt 😂😂
The Porsche is the daddy, but considering the 812 Superfast is a grand tourer, it's faster than the SVJ, maybe not around the track!
Svj
Mat: which one would u get? Me: who has all of them, accept mine is gt3rs
Has anyone noticed that the Lamborghini and the Porsche both have spoilers and the Ferrari doesn't maybe that's why the Ferrari is always coming last in the 1/4 mile drag race
svj
Coming Rome
That 800hp is coming in handy in  the rolls huh Matt? 😂
Porsche. That's it.💆🏻‍♂️
812 sound way better to me
Olá seus gringos feios fracos
Ich weis mich kann hier keiner verstehen aber ich bin trotzdem abgefuckt das Leute immer noch nicht PorschE sagen können.
Super. Fast.
This guy likes racist jokes lol.
That means when u r rolling on the street the Ferrari can beat most super cars on the street …
Porsche 👍
Porche sound like mat vacuum cleaner
The Accents 😂
Lamborghini is the best.
Porsche !
Porsche for sure.
The porsche fast but id have the SVJ
Porshe All Day
I don't care: Forza Ferrari always.💖
Ferrari sounded completely the best
I'd have the SVJ by far
This is why u don't mess with the quiet kid in class.
Ferrari sounded the best I think
Interesting bcz today I told my wife "Even tho were buying Lamborghini I have feeling Ill be back in Turbo Porsche" which is what we've got now But doesnt have PDK which IS why Im dumping my 6spd w/its stage 3 clutch😩.I live in New York which absolutely Sucks Here, so to drive in traffic times is Nitemare w/a 6spd especially with that clutch..After watching so many of Ur races especially using 2021 Turbo S, I cant buy the slower 2019, I cant But I cant afford it New & with the dealer mark-up considering Porsche loaded is under $240k USA & They want $275-325k 4a 2021 Turbo S, So thers gona be ALOT of people losing Alot Of Money on those cars, Kinda like The ZR1 was when came out in 1990..They said they wernt gona produce the car besides that year But ofcourse they did & Everybody who paid $145k & $125k here to get them got a real suprize especially when they bumped the Hp to 405 from the 375 1990 & 385 1991 which I actually had..Boy did I beat on that Car Intill the chain went at over 100k miles & it was Fun Fun Car! But anybody who paid $100k or more, what mistake & I will NOT make tht same mistake now w/a 2021 Turbo S, So ill get Lamborghini Murcielago Now But I know seeing the racing uve done w that Turbo S & the ease of driving the car, Ill wind-up back in Turbo Porsche..W/O ur videos I would not know all is do abt the performance of these very new cars, So ill keep watching long as you keep making them, Thanks So Much🎸🎸🎸
All of these are at walking pace compared to the new Tesla
The germans always can win with less power , it’s amazing 😂
Thank tyu Matt for being on the channel we appreciate it u make these vids so fun man thank you man
Porsche
The Porsche is a sleeping giant.
best carwow video of all time👌👌
The race just started and the Ferrari just had its problems. Cmon,,,
5:28 lambo got a jump start, what kind of comparison is this?
4:17 ferrari sounded way better than that lambo, come on now
i would have the porsche 911 mate, one hell of a car to be honest!!
Porsche prove its worth
Porsche had become a winner it looks like it is not comparable to the other two cars but it is offers more than enough competition to the other two cars superb car ♥️♥️ Porsche
The upshifts in the Lambo are very 2006.
812: in the fastest car here SVJ: lol thats cap im the fastest here 911: idc i will still win
when mat said "hooligan" i died🤣🤣🤣
Lambo
Lambo sound is super
Super fast won the rev compatision
I think the faraday sawndid the best
lambo is god asf
Porsche
The Lamborghini Aventador svj
I'd take an 812 all day
These 2 are too funny together love the disappointment on yannis face when he loses 🤣....to matt
That SVJ is a true fighter...no turbos, no DCT, just brute NA ICE force in motion. The way things are going, the car will end up being a prized collectible by true motorcar enthusiasts. The SVJ did pretty good being the car in the 2nd spot in this case..They should do a TT SVJ..that would be total mental..
the italian says only one thing, "viva il duce"
Ferrari
I love lambos and the svj roadster is my favorite so gotta go with the lambo 😍😍
You got beat yani 😂😂😂
Fararri
Porsche is the quite killer👌💝
Ferrari
I'd take the firari
Porsche 😍
Lamborghini aventador Svj was the best
The Porsche
The Porsche is winning but they dont care. lol
Porsche is like suppressed uzi
Porsche always steady, works, wins.
Stuttgart finest!!
in a porsche fanboy so im gonna buy porsche for real
Watching people in automatic cars drag race is like watching old people french kiss.. just put a fakn  brick on the gas pedal and leave it do its thkng
for looks, between the lambo and the porche
It's like two guys having a hard battle to find out will be 2nd!
Yall actually did my favorite car porsche 911 turbos
Porsche won
Ferarri got the best looking car, lambo got the best sounds, and the Porsche... It's just quicker
I mean Lambo designs are just basically the same shape but Ferrari is always going out with a lot design
Based on this limited test ... Porsche all day everyday, then add some bendy and twisty bits, all year every year Porsche, then general usability daily driver, parking in town, mate - not even a question ITS the PORSCHE
everytime yianni brings his lambo it's just him getting disappointed LMAOOOOO
That lambo is mental stupid its just nuttttttttts and it tops out at 230 mph
PORSCHE!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
ferrei
Sorry Matt SVJ all day long. Just looks so much better then %99.99 out their in it's class.
My favourite laptop is louder than my favourite car
What on earth that Porsche is made of🙄😲

Ferrari
I would have the fer
lambo
Lambo forever
Porsche👍👍👍👍👍
Year after year that little Porsche is the ultimate car, doesn’t look the best, doesn’t sound great, but my money’s always on the Porsche. I’d take a Ferrari sitting in my driveway any day
Got the Turbo s and would not change my girl for any other 🥳
Like just for the accents
911
Ze German Engerneering
Ferrari
I'd have the Porsche anyday
Koensiegg rigera vs Porche 911
Porche 911 design should be updated

Lamborghini aventador SVJ
Lamborghini is the best
Porsche é um terror....
You just cant beat german engineering
Porsche is a silent rocket  💙
love the Porsche!!
That lambo is vile its like a fast & furious car, the 911 is a wolf in sheep clothing, they have evolved the car over decades making it what it is today, the best supercar on the planet.
Svj all day
I'd have the Lamborghini 😁
porsche
Ferrari
These videos are the best testimonials for how great Porche automobiles are...
Porsche speak softly but carry a big stick..outstanding...

Hilarious with the accents lol!
SVJ 💕💕💕💕💕💟💟💞💞💞💟👍💟💞
The fuck, why Porsche always win  The fucckkkkkkkk
Ferrari all day long
Ferrari sounded the best in my opinion
Porsche 911 has been my dream car for 30 years.
Funny when Yanni says I hope I won that. Don’t look to your right.
I will take the 911 turbo s all day everday Mat.
Altho the SvJ is soo amazing but I like the some elements of Porsche 🔥
The only valid reason Porsche 911 turbo is a banger because  its the fastest car from  GTA Vice city//
Svj
Porsche r my fav the gt2
No matter what lambo is always a better looking car
Adolf Hitler and Mussolini 😂
Porsche is like the smartest kid in class yet not many pay attention to him because he aint cool except a few nerd girls.  Lambo is the bad boy who everyone loves. 😁
Porsche silent killer 🔥
Who killed paul Walker its the quiet 911
5:04 and then 3 seconds.. Blade movie OST is starting😄😄😄 di didit dit dit dididiiii
No1 porsche
When you consider the price gap, Porsche is spanking its competitors.
Do this except the Ferrari,put Rimac Nevera and race
porsche      { for the money only )
Chiron v 918 v Laferrari
The best sounding car is the svj it is so loud because yanni was enjoying  it but l like the 812 superfast it sound really good that v12 engine
Ferrari 🐎 ❤️
I would have Svj
Ferrari v12 super fast
porsche is just better
lambo
The recent 991's since the GT3's inception into the Porsche line-up have been road legal track cars. Everything about the 991 platform screams racing.
That Lamborghini looks really, really tacky lol
7:00
I will have the Porsche
Ferrari 4ever.! 👍
carwow why you are comparing naturally aspirated V12 to twin turbo and single clutch car which is much lighter?
Yanni is crap at drivin get the stuff involved
The svj
Porsch is like Captain America. Can beat this giants all day.
The guy driving the Lamborghini doesn’t look like he knows what he’s doing
lambo
I will have the....Porsche....because it is the best car....ever made! :-)
Porshe
I would go with the Porsche. The Ferrari is the best looking tho
Non dire mai più ciao bella con quella voce
definitely lamborghini!!!
100% The porsche
SVJ : Im the fastest  812 : Im the fastest  Porche : ....... What are you arguing for but anyways  I have to go byeeee
the lambo if you are 17, ferrari if you are 27, and porsche when you are 37
I'm pickin' the Porsche 911 Turbo S!
Ferrari👌
I would like to have the Porsche, just to be faster than Jani in his lambo
Porsche 👑
Porche
Ferrari win
porsche
The porsche is better but the lambo wins in looks and coolnes.
SVJ
😆😆😆 love the accents
Yianni: Let the Porsche go just beat matt
Dude that 911 turbo s is just nuts🔥...i guess rimac's electric car is the only one that can beat the turbo s 10.0 seconds that too with low brake power compared to svj and 812 they have the v12 but 911 just a 6 but even then its the king of 1/4 mile 🤙
That silver kid knocked out beasts 😎🤩
yo my grandmas from cardiff lol
Ferrari sounded best
To much talking boys!!! Just race man
porsche
porsh
I am fan from India like Lamborghini Avendator
I am sure m5 will beat the Ferrari on a race
Ferrari
TURBO YAAAA haha
Porsche. Except no substitute.
The horse beat the bull, and the other horse!
Porsche has 1/2 less Cylinders, cost 1/2 price, no need to warm tires and can repeat over and over without a worry. And its a daily driver. Absolute best car. All it needs is a better sounding exhaust!
I would take the Porsche over Lamborghini and Ferrari any day of the week
Yianni took an L , but he beat mat so its a W
Porsche
this was more entertaining than Fast and Furious movies
Lamborghini it is faster
Ferrari: Superloud v12 Lamborghini: Even louder V12 Porsche: VACCUM CLEANER: ACTIVATED
Lamborghini and porsche
Lamborghini
I’ll take the Ferrari. It’s what’s best about both cars combined.
But Look, everyone says that porsche crushing Ferrari and lamborghini but i wanted to say congratulations to lamborghini for winning with Ferrari because lamborghini is really heavy and it has no twin turbos
SVJ
The Lambo
9ine eleven is king😍😍😍
Porsche is insane😍
Yanny didnt look as happy in this video when the 488 pista killed the lambo in the other vids lol.
the 812 looks miles better than that wedge looking lambo, the 812 is nice and sleek looking while the lambo is too much in the eyes.
I would have the lambo
I would love to get a Ferrari SVJ Turbo or a Lamborghini Superfast 911😅🤣❤
That ferrari sound is pure love
Lamborghini Aventador
LAMBORGHINI IS BEST
Beside the Porsche all do a early start….
A12
The Porsche
That one person that races in Lamborghini's... Yianny
Lamborghini
No matter the price: 812>911>SVJ With price: 911+House > 812+apartment > SVJ Looks: 812>911>SVJ Bragging/showup: SVJ 3x times
Ferrari sounds the best
None… I wish I have a Zr1 2012
That ferrari v8 stradale thing is amazing ngl
A ferrari is always a true sports car....lambos are actual pandas
For the looks Lamborghini definitely
Porsche is the best
The Porsche
The Porsche is faster
less horse power more speed not what i expected
That was real tense XD
the Porsche 911 turbo s
That 911...incredible.
Svj
Affordable wise- Porsche Looks wise-Ferrari all day every day
I would definitely have the ferarri, it looks and sound AMAZING!
Lol Lamborghini and Ferrari fighting for 2nd place. While the Porsche was the whole race in front of both.  And that with a vacuum cleaner ref sound. Hahaha. Good job Porsche 🤣
Accents on point there lol
Like every video I watch with a Porsche 911 that’s on carwow… PORSCHE ALL DAY EVERYDAY!!!! (I like the other cars too)
911: you can race guys, i’ll be waiting for u on the finish line
That Porsche Sheesh haha...
That Porsche just killing these giants.
Hi matt I like all three cars very gd cars there all very nice cars but is hard to say which one is the best out of the lanbo and the one that matt was in for speed matt is the fastest car but going on looks then is got to be the lanbo and what matt was in but all three cars are very nice and fast.
My love Ferrari B12 super fast
imagine a gt2rs here with this company
Porche sounds the best
I LOVE THE SOUND OF THE SVJ
Ferrari is my favorite though.
SVJ
Money no object the Lamborghini is the choice for me!
That feeling when most of the CARS are worth more than your house.
ferrari
German power
Germqn power
300kplus-250k plus  then there’s the 150k who’s like am built different 😹😹😹
Porsche all day long
Porsche is the best sports car in the world
German engineering 🇩🇪
Lamborghini
The moment I saw other video that porches beat McLaren p1 apperently I knew who gonna win in this video cause both lambo and Ferrari can't beat McLaren p1

I clicked on the video and saw the porsche and i already knew what is going to happen ....porsche is always winning no matter what car is on the line ...next time just put a picture of the porsche we already know what is going to happen
Auf jeden Fall den Porsche!!! I come from germany.
im voting for that dyson on the right lol
Ferrari best looking BY FARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ................. Just sayin
When I was a kid I had Countach posters, when I grew up I wanted a Ferrari. Now I’m really old I’d take the Porsche so I could just drive it and not worry about it breaking down.
I will have the 812 superfast
Porsche is best
Fanboys will always burn when their favourite car loses to Porsche. No car company on the planet can hold a candle to Porsche they're build to last a lifetime if they put a V10 or V12 naturally aspirated engine in the 911, then Ferrari, Lamborghini, Bugatti and Mclaren all go home with an ocean of tears. Porsche are playing with these little boys who make too much noise but lose in the end hahahhaha btw Yanni you ain't good looking either an average looking guy who drives an expensive Lamborghini.
Lamborghini always the love 😍😍
Ferrari looks best and thats all i care if it has at least 150HP :D
Why is the Porsche so fast I thought a lambo is way more wick
When you are young, do not think that you are weak. When you start working, you realize that you are not small
Race-1% Talk and speech-99%
Ferrari 812 : Screaming troublemaker in the school.  Lambo SVJ : Shouty kid with good looks.  Porsche 911 : Principal of the school.
To all the car people. Welcome home 🏠🏁
the 911 sounds the best
Lambo is best
Matt’s accents  are amazing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Porsche yyds！
Porsc of course

Easy Ferrari
First the worst second the best third the hairy princess 😂😂🤣😂😅😂🤣😂😅😂😂🤣😂😅😆😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣😂😅😂🤣😂😂🤣😂😅
I like the Lamborghini best i think. That lambo countach  poster from when I was a kid still has its lasting effects.
obviously the ferrari sounds better
LAMBO: VRMMMM!! FERRARI: VRMMM! PORSCHE: VRM  And the winner is Porsche.🏆
The Italian 🇮🇹 accent 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Jamaican here 🇯🇲
All these cars would be fun for exactly ONE day
id have the 911
I’d rather live with the Porsche everyday but I love the lambs the most. The Ferrari is epic but I like the f12 tdf styling more
Porsche is the best ! Class and performances
I would have the porche with the svj exuast
Definetely Porsche.. makes Lamborghini and Ferrari look like Lego
Porche is the best
PORSCHE ALL THE WAY!!!!
It’s so irritating how no one is level on the rolling race, hence different results every time
It was the ferrari
Ferri soad better
I like the 812 but with a big ass wing
The take away from your videos with Porsches is, don't bet against a Porsche.
i d pick 812, it looks stunning
Porsche 😎
Sound lambo
German cars really are performance monsters. Like price/value is insane
I would go with the Ferrari 812 super fast
Porsche
i would get the Porsche
where the "JAGUARS"
Lambo sjv i would get
The Ferrari 812 superfast is my dream car, I’d go with the Ferrari
Love the looks & sound of the Lamborghini but the performance of the Porsche Turbo s
For the Lamborghini svj you needed to have it in corsa mode  and in Italian its race mode
I would have a Ferrari!!
800hp vs 770hp vs 650German hp.  WHO wins... x)
SVJ the best!
Its better for you dont speak italian 😂😂😂😂
Lamborghini svJ
I would want the Porsche because I would rather have a fast car then one that looks good but doesn’t preforme well
Lamborghini
Svj 100%
man that accent was spot on!! at least for me
Porsche = Germany 💖🔥😘😍😎
Ferrari always disappoints. so overrated
In Germany we say: Deutsche Ingenieurskunst mein Freund
I want that SVJ
defently ferarri
Porsche 911 turbo sounds not very great but it purform very nice
Porsche!
i love ferari
Lamborghini SVJ best one
I’d rather have an SVJ over the Porsche and the Ferrari
The lambo
The lambo
Porsche 911 turbo s
Let’s say the truth! Ferrari’s and Lamborghini’s top speed is better than porsche, but in acceleration porsche has got a lot of traction
I would have the Ferrari 812 SUPERFAST
I guess silence does make a difference 😅
i was crying for lambo
LAMBORGHINI SVJ IS THE BEST OR La ferari
uh oh 812 competizione is now a thing
The race is all about 2nd 🥈 tht lambo vs ferrari 😅 porsche🥵
Even if the Ferrari is faster i dont care i love the lambo more
SVJ 100%🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wow very good  check my M6 Revs
Porsche is godlike. That engineering is just ridiculous. I'd definitely have the porsche, best looking, fastest, most credible racing pedigree.. so on
Dont judge a car how it sounds. 💗💗👍👍
Lambo is my favt but Porsche is the one i can almost buy if i sell myself any my family and friends 😂😂
Give me that Porsche, I’ll take it over the others
That porker is fast af
Hearing the Aventador spinning its tyres away from Matts POV in the Ferrari at 05:05..  Un...Reaall  🤤🤤
Porsché always out performs !! Lambo sorry i am just not a fan! It's like having yellow!  It's just obnoxious!! And the svj is $700k on the market to $1m   The 600k super fast gts and 300k 911 turbo!! Real Numbers
LAMBORGHINI SVJ !!!!!!!!!!
Porche is the best sounding wacum cleaner there is.
Porsche is Silent                     Cheaper                      Less powerful                    But Queen
So I got one more thing to buy a Porsche 😏
I am with Yanni, Aventador is the most beautiful car.
Lamborghini 🔥🔥🔥🔥😎😎😎😎🔥🔥🔥😎🔥🔥🔥😎🔥🔥
Porsche is my favorite dream car
360k for a piece of crap
Lambo
Volkswagen is the real winner here
We need to see the 765lt vs svj vs 812 superfast
Tha Lamborghini
Porshe is mi Dreams car
Porsche rules !! 😎😎😎😎
Porsche wow😍😍😍
812 Superfast
Porsche,porsche,porsche all the bloody way
Lambo
The porsh do be vibing doe
I would have the aventador svj
I wouldn't think a second about which car I would have. I would have the car that doesn't scream "I'M RICH! LOOK AT ME!" whilst still handing their assets back to them
Is pick the Ferrari, I just love the looks
Man the sound of Lambo is always so fucking crisp
Porsche has the best sound because if I had any of these cars could I go for a drive at night without waking up the entire village.  The ferrari sounds the best tho
yanni jumped the start and still got his v12 smoked by a 6 cylinder
I wil take the porch because I like German cars like Mercedes
How tf is that 911 so fast
I’d definitely have the svj
Porsche 911 Turbo S ❤️
7:15 HAHAHAHAHAHA
the Lambo
You’re telling me that the lambo is 500 grand in US dollars?
Lamborghini sounds the best
Porsche ❤️❤️
When you bullying the nerd boy  Porsche :  "all day everyday"  "the porsche won it" 3x
It's not about the noise, its about performance, therefore Porsche the car for me.
Ferrari
Lambo
My dad already has a Porsche 911 gts
Porsche
German engineering FTW!!!
Matt shut up
SVJ all day
Ferrari is the perfect racing car which can win.
The Porsche
SVJ Super sexy
Ferrari
lambo
aventodor won its sooooooo loud
I would choose the Ferrari because my dad has a porsche
Hate you Yanni very much
Always the silent one is the most dangerous
Porsche sound the best 🎶
911
The Ferrari is the best car
Love that nobody said anything about the start of Yanni in the first drag. He went before she put her hands down and was cocky about beating the Ferarri xD Then in the next race he was so close to losing. But we all knew the Porsche would beat them both, it's such a machine.
Wanna see a WIDEBODY cars to see if it would add more weight
SVJ
Yanny
F
812 🔥🔥❤️
EVERY CAR LOOK PERFECT MAN OH MY GOD
Porshe has surprised me Wowww
Porsche ... Silent killer.
I would go with the porche
who is watching this in 2021 is a legand
CS PANDA got 21 subs in 2020 after this video like 9 months later he got 16K …
Porshe
During the brake test..... the Porsche driver was smiling hearing the other drivers talking !!! 🤣
Yeah that Lambo won the sound check
This is so amazing! Love the accents, love the cars.. Yanni is hilarious in that SVJ and i think a mclaren 720s in the party would be interesting! Porche is the king tho!
Is it just me who thinks ferrari sounded better it was not the loudest but more musical
The Ferrari has clearly tremendous torque, and is more slippery so after 100 mph murders both. It's not called Superfast for nothing. Has more class than the other two together, possibly the best technology, and its possibly the most fun on the road, by adjustability and just perfect set up and the most advanced and flattering electronic nannies of the three. And lets not forget is a GT with a big boot on the back so that means being the best for long journeys.  Porsche is just a turbo monster, that probably makes 60 hp more than declared stock(just because Germans say they do 640 hp and adjust the engine to 700 as standard procedure) and has the best traction and braking.And like they said, on the real world is the better car, if you want a car to take you from point a to b that is. Or if you often drive your supercar in the city. Or If you don't like waking up the neighboors.  The Lambo is actually the fastest off the lane somehow, has great brakes, but those good looks slow him down after 100 mph(Crazy wing, crazy front spoiler, edges everywhere) and lacks torque(engine is more of a screamer than a puller).However the way it looks and sounds its on another league(and I really like the 812 but is not the same) and as we all know, all those wings add downforce and that ALA system make it  the faster around a track(or at least it is on nurburgring, and by a healthy margin). However is the worst at those things the Porsche does so well.  So I take the Lambo with the 812 a close second. The Porsche is crazy fast, but the way it sounds and looks leaves me cold.
Would prefer Ferrari.. looks
ferrari 812
Lambo for sure
I vote For the lambo Cuase the lamborghini svj Sounds Better and it sounds SOOOO LOUD THATS WHY the ferrari Sound good and so louder but i still pick the Svj The porche ehh i cant hear it to tho lol
The reaction killed me lol 5:05 😂💔
812 is beautiful
Porsche ist the Best !
❣️
Ferrari Sound : OK OK LAMBO SOUND: FULL OF RAGE PORSCHE SOUND BE LIKE : CALM BEFORE THE STORM 🌪🌪🏎🏎
lamborgini
LAAMBO WON
I would have the Ferrari 812
Ferrari
Your German accent is insane I can’t stop watching that moment 🤣🤣
Lamborghini svj
Porsche
The Porsche all day long.
lambo jumped the takeoff....id drive the 911 every time all the time!! lambo would be my fourth pic if there were 4 lol...never liked em ... for beauty ferrari hands down and had the sweetest exhaust note...ferraries are amazing!!! but i love love love german engineered cars...they are definite masters...so again for me the 911 does it all!!! lambo go back to the factory...ugliest supercar!!! too angular with boring straight lines...id get 2 awesome 911s for the price of one of those overpriced pos lambos!!! as for americans i would only consider the ford GT...otherwise its porsche...bmw...audi...or mercedes!!!
That's why I love Porsche 911 turbo s my dream car and it just my dream car if you now what imean🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂
I would rather have the porsche
911 🔥
Can someone educate me about the Porsche? How did it beat the two cars?
Porsche 911 turbo s and if not that a Porsche Taycan
Porsche rules them all. Give it a cheap softwareupgrade and it will eat them up
Man the accents were perfect😂😂🤣🤣🤣
I would have the porsh for sure ! It looks better too
HAHA the German was pretty good and funny if you ask me.😂😂😂
I’d like to buy the lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Porsche- The best all rounder. Aventador- Best looking car. Ferrari- A panda.
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ sounds great the best
Lamborghini Aventedor SVJ
Porsche
Porsche all day everyday!!🔥🔥
Best sound aventador Svj
SVJ best looking
So proud of my German heritage. Lol
Porsche, the silent assassin. 😂
Lamborghini only 🚗💨🇮🇹
svj win's
yani
porsche
I would have  a Lamborghini
Lamborghini  has the best  sound
Lamborghini  sounds  the best
I would definitely have the Ferrari
I wanna see any car smoking that 911
porsche with tuned exhaust not that bullshit
Logically, I'd go for the Porsche.... Honestly, I'd go for the Ferrari....Hypothetically, I'd go for the Lamborghini.... Realistically, I'd go for all 3
I would have the svj Matt gonna be honest 😂
812 superfast isn't track focused so it can compete Aventador s not svj  812 Competizione vs svj or sian would be perfect
No va be il ciao bella all inizip fa troppo ridere
TL;DR the VW won
Porsche, amazing engineering!!!!
Id take the Porsche all day,, looks Amazing & it’s a bullet,  you could drive that thing everyday & it would be the most reliable by far & just  hectic.. best car program by far love it,  you guys got the best job haha good on you fellas. All the best il be watching of course.. Nik the Greek from Sydney In Australia.. 🇬🇷🤙🏾🇦🇺
Porsche 911 Turbo S All Day Every Day.
Mat always kill me with his accents🤣🤣🤣
Svj
I would want to get a Porsche
i love ferrari
Yanni jumped the first start, Mat jumped the second. Doesn't matter though, Porsche is faster than both with half the engine ;)
Ferrari 100%
Porsche 911 turbo s
I wuld have Porsche
I like the Ferrari more
Ferrari 812 super fast 🤩🤩🤑
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Porsche sounds best
Those Italian beauties can't be compared with Porsche. They just can't. Porsche is a great car. But it never was in their league and it isn't. Porsche can be great sport car, super car but never an exotic car. Don't mention drag times to me. If we measure value of car by drag time then Tesla is best car in the world.
Ferrari’s F12 and the 812 are both super slow. The problem with them is that they carry a lot of weight. They’re like exotic station wagons. They sound good though. Lol.
The porche is silent but fast
That ferrari is beautiful
What are the Germans putting in them porches?
11:32 the face expression of the Porsche driver: ohno I'm soooo proudd~
I would definitely have a porshe 911 turbo s and lamborghini aventador Svj
Don't underestimate porsches
Swj
sound test i would say the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Lamborghini
I oh would Easily take the Ava for looks but the Porsche for Practicality
What about sound  Italy:hold my beer
That sound and gas response of the 812 are from another world 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
the labo
Lamoborghnin sounds better
svj
Im german and laugh my ass off. Great accent Mat 😅😅
The Porsche is the car that cameraman use to film the fastest car in the world
Lambo
when you are buying cars at this level. speed is not everything you should worry about.
I'm doing that aswell then mat is just like wow
Porsche seems to be in a different league, when it comes to sports car. Defeating Aventador and a 812 is no joke.
812 sounded the best.
Lamborghini svj
Imagine the 911 Turbo S getting tuned to a 1000bhp!
Lambo
porsche 911 turbo s
Svj
i would have the ferrari if i had a choice like i just love the look of it... it never gets old and i love rear wheel drive cars even tho they dont launch that good
i love that ferrari looks soooooooo good and is way cheaper than lambo and even destroyed it in rolling race
Naturally aspirated engine forever!
Can you race lamborghini aventador svj with an bmw m5[tuned to 1000hp]
I'll take the Lambo Aventador SVJ over all of them for looks and sound. But the Porsche 911 Turbo being fast and quiet, well they are trying to get from Stuttgart to Warsaw quickly and quietly!!! 🤣
only 156000 .. that's what he said
Porsche 😈👍👍👍
Lamborghini: pure brutal rage Ferrari: light, sophisticated  Porsche: Mach 10 beast
Bruh the Porsche is not only the fastest drag but is one of the best handling cars on earth lol
The house of the raging bull is king
Porches
Porches
Lbo
The porsche soundcheck: 😵 The porsche drag race: 😎
AVENTADOR SVJ !!!
Has the to be Turbo S, if only so that you can shut up any Tesla/EV fanboy when they say their milk float is faster
FERRARI AND LAMBORGHINI - all about show off PORSCHE 911 TURBO S - just a innocent looking beast
Lamborghini
On the basis of looks that Lqmbo is 🔥🔥🔥but Porsche is brilliant performer 👌🏻😘
Farrier
porsche for the win
THE PORSCHE IS THE BEST! LAMBOS SUCK! FERRARIS STINK!
Race starts at 5.20
812 For sure with AWD !!!
Dis is 1 of my best MAT WATSON's CARWOW videos yet, jus bcoz of his perfection on both Italian & German accents. Well done MAT. Ur my perfect replacement 4 my most loved JEREMY CLARKSON, once of TOP GEAR.
The Porche 911
Lamborgini is always have a secret speed, although it win or lose in the drag  race don't be happy first, it's just a Youtube channel
Hooligan by mat watson😂😂
Lambo is too lame
From the inside the f12 sounds incredible the lambo sound just as incredible on the outside
The overreacting guy makes the car he is driving slow
Svj
Lambo
Lamborghini svj
Weather you like him or not.. the big brown guy with the funny looking nose knows how to drive a Lambo .
Lamborghini
May I would take the Porsche
My Gtr Nismo would sweep all these kids in a jiffy 😂
Ferrari is the only rear-wheel drive car in this video: goes neck to neck in the drag race , blows them away in the rolling race, and then the Porsche is the better car. Funny logic.
Easy ...Porsche 911 Turbo S
*You* *killed* *the* *British* *accent.*
If that lambo uses dct it will more faster than that
No one is talking about Porsche  so much in the video
Go Porsche
The Ferrari
That Porsche is insane
Ferrari on sound test
Ferrari fore shurre
A weird video, the clear winner is in least focus here. Why...
Any day, that Black Ferrari for me 🔥🔥🔥
Your
Ferrari: I'm faster Lamborghini: I'm faster Porsche: Hold my beer🍺
Finally I was able to see the girl who set off the race,she Is  cute !😍
Lamborghini sounds best..
that porsche is savage af
Ill have the porsche it is classs if not that then deffo the ferraarrii
The Porsche should get wings and fly
Porsche always!
Poor-sche lol
Ferrari 812 superfast
Porsche power⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡
Never judge a Porsche sound without its speed
Porsche
Porsche
I trully believe that the porsche is the best looking car of them
!!Wow Porsche!!
Ferrari
That wing on the svj must create a lot of drag
Love that 911 turbo 😍
5:41 🤫 respect the king 👑
812 for me because is rear wheel drive and get head to head with the svj that is all wheel drive, the superfast can't be compared with them is superior
I love the lamborghini and I support yani too. I would buy the lamborghini by far I wouldn't even look at the purche or ferrari. Yani I love you!!!
Lambo gets more growlers
Porsche though 😍
Lamborghini  sounded better
Porsche - german made 💪🏼
1a. This has got to BE THE BEST RACE EVER!!  2. WHY DOESN'T LAMBO USE A DOUBLE CLUTCH IN THEIR V12s?? 3. The PORSCHE IS STILL THE BEST BANG FOR YOUR BUCK 4 SUPERCAR MONEY I LOVE LAMBORGHINI
Yianni, second place is the first loser
Porsche doesn't let u down
The 812 SUPERFAST IS AN UGLY SLOPPY LAZY DESIGNED F12. annnnnd the Italians should be ashamed
Ok
ferrari
What in the world is in Porsche turbo 's engine? 😂👌
Porsche 911
The Porsche has 120HP less than the Lamborghini and also weighs about a 100 kilograms more than the bull. Still incredibly fast ! What a car!
911 is value!
I want 812 super fast  it’s a monster with her airo dynamics system  and the back wheel turns not like the Lamborghini airo system that make her so tuf and she slipy even with all thes stuff
The title is.." Porsche and the others"
That Porcshe is like, I am just here to win as always. 1st position is mine. You kids can fight over 2nd position
Lamborgini Svj
Imagine porsche building a hyper car💀💀💀
Imagine porsche building a hyper car💀💀💀
I'd rather have the Porsche bruv. Doesn't particularly like them before. Start liking since end last year
Porsche hands down.
SVJ
Porsche 911 is the best sports car...no doubt
The aventador svj sound better
Germany porshe😘
LAMBOOOOOO ALL DAY!!!!!!
Porsche any day of the week..
Can we talk about Yanni jumping the start in 1st race 🤣
The bull didn’t beat the horse at all.  The horse beat the bull and the other horse! Check the Porsche badge next time Yanni, there’s a horse on there!
ferrari every day
lambo sounds best but id buy the porsche ,ferreri nice too but too much money
Porschè any day
Ferrari classic but sporty
Porsche
Porsche -_-
I like Lamborghini Aventador SVJ 63
I guess whoever was driving that porsche wore full porsche merch, not just a hat. It makes all the difference
Honestly who cares about the Porsche 🤣😂😂😂
I think the lambo and the ferrari sounded best
Per la giapponese non posso aversi la Maccino di Lambo, tipo di SVJ ma Moddela di la Avantador puoi aversi esserci posibilita a farsi tu level di inf,e abilità di giro .   Comprarsi questa high performances Maccino per favore !!  Vandarsi  di  possesso!! Da I’italiana maestria Representativo di M.M Per Favore!!
Victory for locomotive of Lamborghini ,Suspenssion System of Renolt , Total shape applied aerodynamics of Ferrari , Difficult blow locomotive of BMW, Enduarance locomotive of Fiat, Base Maccino as named Car of Bughati and Ford , that’s all.
Victory for locomotive of Lamborghini ,Suspenssion System of Renolt , Total shape applied aerodynamics of Ferrari , Difficult blow locomotive of Bmw, Enduarance locomotive of Fiat, Base Maccino as named Car of Bughati and Ford , that’s all.
SVJ
Ferrari
Rari is the best
Best intro:))
Porsche I would have for sure but the FERRARI is a very close 2nd
If someone is driving Lamborghini it will be yanni
Those suck, Porsche is King Tut
Lambo
Lamborghini
That Porsche carried the entire video my goodness
I honestly have never thought about getting a Porsche till today. I knew they were fast but DAMN!!!
Karens be like the Porsche sounds better cuz it’s quieter
ferarri
Really shock by the Porsche
Team Lambo
I would have te svjaventador
Porsch 911 turbo s is my favorite car
cheapest but the best  porsche lol
Matt is sooo desperate to win sometimes its annoying
C'mon guys.. it's pronounced Por-shuh and ya both got spanked by it!
All I say is German engineering
Porsche won because it's turbo
But its still just a Porsche
The 911 turbo S is an absolute masterpiece 👌
Porsche is the king
Deutsche Qualität :) Porsche ist halt einfach ein Monster und dazu noch so geil vom Aussehen
The ferrari 812
ferrari
Hooligan 😂💀
Porsche 911 Turbo S
🤣 Yanni gets so Fuckin’ serious! 😂 “-C’MON!” 🤣
Svj
812: I’m the fastest and I sound the best  SVJ: No I do 911: Allow me to introduce my self :)
Everyone in the comments giving spoilers
Ferrari🤩
Svj sound s the best
5:42 - did he just push the pedal harder, like you did as a kid in a go cart?
Ferrari 812
Porsche. 100%
Emma watson
And when people say its boring to drive a turbo Porsche compared to a Lambo or Ferrari, just give them a GT3 or GT3 RS and most will never say that again. They just build the best sports cars
The al time and purpose the alman handsomemans the name of porsche.the cry lambo y ferrari.do yu see .porshe of the smile angry car of the legend emperator.
The best looking one is the lambo by far.
Porsche 911
yianni 100% jumped the start of the first drag race😂 well impressed with it keeping up with the porche though
Easily the SVJ it’s my dream car lol 😂
porshe!!!
@scousenofeyzulla what’s the point, it’s almost like cheating, getting maximum horse out of materially aspirated engines is more of an art
imagine paying half a mill+ to get beat by a elegant looking porsche for half the price
Porsche
THE GERMANS
Porsche is about launch system Ferrari is about speedddd! Lambo is about looks and sound
Nobody felt more alive under acceleration than yanni. It sounds immense. I'm a big EV fan. The bigger fan I become the more I appreciate the sound of those cars.
As soon as i saw the title i knew porsche won
Why did they not have a camera on the porsche driver??
Porsche
Italian is only for MAFIA and pasta pizza
You actually nailed both accents😂😂 I was honestly really surprised how well you did the German one hah
i would have a lambo
Porsche 911 Turbo S. By far the better car in performance, fuel consumption, initial costs and maintenance.
But if I had to choose Ferrari
911s are just stupid
Uooooo uoooooo
Mats German accent 😂😂😂
i would take the 812 superfast but damn you cant ignore the Porsche
Ferrri
I just love how they're just ignoring the Porsche in the background
The Lambo is the best
Tire pressure monitor fuck off? It probably affects cars performance
Porsche
lamboo
I think this is one of the loudest drag race ever on this channel🙌
911 turbo for me
I am an audi fanboy but that Porsche is quick!!!
Supra Mk4 sounds beter
The Lambo I think
Porsche does not use its power to make noise.
Lambo sounds like a 50ccm bike.
Best sounding drag race ever
Porcheeee
The Germans....again(porsche,there is no substitute.)
Porsche: hi my kids😂😂🤣🤣
Porsche!!!!
Of theese 3 i'd want the superfast
Porsche be like :- they will fight I'll enjoy my race bruh 😂
German Horses better than those Italian Horses and Bulls. Half cylinders, lesser HP,  may be lesser aerodynamic just don't matter. Respect Porsche.
Ferrari always
German Engineering
In Denmark you see more Avantadors and F12/812 than 992, so I love the 812, however I take the 992
Yanny did jumped the first race. 😬
Porsche for life
i will take aventador svj.all day every day
Porsche 911 turbo.... Regálame un auto... Nunca tuve uno... Please 🙏
wie kann man mit einem lamborghini  ablosen????
Yanni keeps bloody cheating. Go when the arms are down ffs
porsche  for me please
PORSCHE !
These supercars doing 400 meters in 10ish seconds Usain Bolt did 100 meters in sub 10ish seconds So these hyper cars just 4x times faster than fastest man, crazy stat!
812 superfast for sure
The SVJ is a lot better Race track vehicle, especially at something like the Nurburgring
812
Midle
I like u Mat, u r really good mate. Keep it up
Mat jump the start un the second race. For me the Lamborghini clearly beat the Ferrari
Turbo plays an important role,it would be fair if all the cars racing had turbo in it.
Aka VW vs Ferrari
Every german be like its called porschE not porsch... 🤦🏽‍♂️
Those extra torque to axle in porche cause the win
big man not even shifting his gears lol. the car is in automatic mode with a robotized manual gearbox.  F
Yeah 911, btw who won between Ferrari and Lamborghini??
that Ferrari... WOW
porsche 911
For Arie
The lambo and Ferrari be like : look at me I'm hot and fast. Keeps showing off with their sounds. The Porsche : Quiet and better.
Porche sounds best😂
Ferrari won the sound test for sure!
The distinct line causally groan because scent demographically transport into a hilarious prosecution. delicious, neat zephyr
I want the ferrari
The Ferrari looks wicked, Porsche never looks nice to me
La diferencia está simplemente dada porque el 911 es doble tracción. Si no fuera así otra sería la historia.
PORSCHE 911 TURBO S
Nothing sounds better than a Ferrari v-12.
Real drag race @7:05  Real roll race @8:20
SVj
That porsche just fucks off XDDDD
Rimac Nevera
Not bad for all the aero in the SVJ
The aventador sounded like a gunshot when yianni was on the rev limiter
I’m looking back at this video in 2021 and I’m going to be fully honest, I tried both the Ferrari 812 and the SVJ, I love all Italian cars as they are legends but my heart will go for the Ferrari
7:13 this part is amazing. Love the sounds
Porsche Turbo  kill‘s em all 😉
812 superfast
Between the lambo or the porche
Porsche is a silent killer 🔥
Porsh
Where's Britain here
Hat e yanni
I love ❤ Porsche flat engine 😍😍
The Porsche’s exhaust note is like a fighter jet reaching into its large reservoir of power, and that power is limitless. The Lamborghini and Ferrari have loud exhausts, but always sound that they maxed out their power in the first few moments of the race.
Wtf, lambo is a trash near the Porsche and Ferrari bro! How?
Is unbelievable see that the Porsche is better than a lambo, LOOK AT THAT bro
Id have the SVJ. Put a max of 5000 miles on it. Sell it in 15 years for 1 million puonds.
Porsche
Love the svj
the Porsche is the quite kid of the class who is the best
Ferrari 812 superfast thank you
The Porsche😂
Clearly the Ferrari sounded the best, and as always.
ferrari
Lambo SVJ
Ok, Porsche is the best car. But performance isn't everything. Styling also counts, and let's be honest, nobody beats the Lambo in styling.
I'm honestly all for the Porsche.   Cringe, I know.
Bro that Ferrari is hot af
So essentially, the Porsche won nearly everything and the special edition Lambo technically won nothing... hahahahaha Well played Porsche
No one NO ONE beats thz zerman 😎
Second race: Yianni: "c'mon" - "uh oh!" @7:15
Porsche beat both in all rounds
Porsche the silent Assassin🚘🚘🚘
hi,my father just bought a new 992 gt3 and we just need to wait 2 months and 20 days to see it waith our eyes! yeea boyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I am from germany.
Porche one
The wandering boundary identically influence because suede universally plant off a imminent locket. interesting, grotesque freighter
lambo
faking Lamborghini just like a fart .But I al so love that porches
Ferrari. 812 🔥🔥🔥
Riches by Ferrari or Lambo, legends buy Porche
Ferrari 812 Superfast... More like Farrari 812 SuperFat :)
The aventador has won rev battle
The Porsche is one of a kind🔥🔥🌝 just love ❤️
Porsche!! it just needs some inconel exhaust
If torque and hp were in graph, Ferrari's line would be closer to horizontal than the other 2
Ferrari: I am no substitute Lamborghini: I am no substitute Porsche: I know
Ferrari 812
Obviously Porsche
Porsche!!
A very good friend of mine owns two of these cars and the 911 is one of them..I have driven the 911 Turbo and it is a beast that people forgot... can be driven slowly around town then outrun most others when needed.
I like how the porsche is casually beating the other cars in the background 😂👌
Porsche, thanks.
Lamborghini Aventadoe SVJ 63! for me!
Ferrari
Lambo is just about be loud, Ferrari makes  melody. Ferrari are not made for silly drag race (2x4 car against 4x4, 4x4 of course win having a better traction) Ferrari are made to enjoy among curves, Lamborghini started to make 4x4 cars cause they went straight instead to turn.
911 is NO joke
My dream car is the porsche 911 turbo s or gt2.  Im just a Porsche guy ok chill
The 812 on the roll is just a bully man  A modern DCT on the aventador would do miracles considering how fast it already is The 911 is just crazy lmao, wondering about the next gen GT2RS
V12 screaming is... HEAVEN !
Italiani 😂 Ciao bellla 🇮🇹
フェラーリハットだけ理解出来た
That black Ferrari look so mean and badass.
Turbo S for the performance and daily driving, 812 (but the GTS variant) for my ears and goose bumps on Sundays.
When you’re 0,04% italian
i want to see a porsche 911 2RS in this chanel
Lamborghini svj
Best  video on carwow for me
I'm a Lamborghini fan boy and I love to have that Aventador SVJ.
9:36 Yianni jumped
Do you assist in selling cars in the USA ??
🔥911 Turbo S. The silent assassin. Kills everything.
1/2 and 1/3 of the price Porsche kills italian dreams :)))))))))))))))))
I’d take the lambo
Let’s talk abt the bull beating the horse
Lamborghini aventador svj sounds best
The Porsche it looks better and it's actually better
I would rather have the 812 superfast
That Porsche is balistic
812 Superfast
Ferari for sure
and also the cheapest, I will definitely say the Porsche is the best car
The Best is the Porsche
Why is Porsche faster despite having less power and same heavyweight ?
Svj
lambo all day evry day
Yiannis nose won the second drag race
Ferrari sounds the best
if I get a sjv then i will sell it and buy a mk4 supra 2jz over 1000hp
my heart says laamborgini but my brain says porsche.
lamborghni ofc
So what we learned is that the Porsche makes about 725 Bhp and that's awesome! Also buy any of these cars in the non-GPF model year 👍🏻
Lamborghini is still tha king of all supercars
Matt's foreign accents... just adorable!
Though italians were in the lime light of this video due to the high profile.. but this video was OWNED by the germans
Porsche is so great with way less power ist wins.
Porshe was the silent killer
Porshe is WINNER
why everyone is commenting on the porsche ? just look at the beauty of that aventador SVJ !
Farrier
Did yianni do a donut in a lambo to warm up his tyres, is that what I saw
V12 Ferrari
Porsche
Nach der heutigen Grip Sendung wollte ich mich nochmal vergewissern, dass porsche einfach der Wahnsinn ist 😅
Porsche 911 Turbo
🇮🇹🇮🇹
I would have an aventador svj
I will  have the lamborghini svj sell it and then buy a porsche
Porsche cause it can even be a daily driver and it trashes every other car.
That Porsche is the definition of silent but deadly.
Get the Porsche a 2K$ Chip Tuning and you have a unbeatable machine
Lamborghini and ferrari is the definition of the phrase in front of Porsche : an empty vessel sounds more 😂
Ferrari sound Best
Porsche is the best 💯💯💯💯
Considering that the 812 is front engine rear wheel drive it did pretty good
Ciao bellllla.
That porsche is just there as a spectator. The video is actually about lambo vs ferrari
its not porsch IT IS PORSCHE.
that Porsche is NASTY. I always loved those.
Lambo
Pretty insane launch for 812 and it's RWD, neck n neck with svj and kills everything in rolling.
911 turbo s the best
ferrari
The voices you do are absolutely funny
The Ferrari ist the best i love it !
I would ferrari 812 superfast cause its fast, elegant, its got awsome sound
Porsche has really proven itself
Porsche is the ultimate daily driver one could buy
Porsche turbo s n1.....
I would have the LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR SVJ . ITS SUPER LOUD
Ferrari wins the sound competition
If you want to win a drag race, you need to get a 911 Turbo S!🔥
My fav ferari 812
...I think Porsche sound better😅
Porsche 🖤 is the definition of action speaks louder than words.
100% Would have the Porsche. My dream car!
MIATA
I love Mats reaction to the wo derful sound of the Ferrari
Definetly the Porsche is the best, even it isn't the fastest Porsche you choosed (GT2RS). The Turbo S is the Performer in this test 👍😁 Lamborghini and Ferrari are more or less Poser cars 🤷‍♂️😉🙂. To be loud is not everything.
The Lambo was 🤩🤩
I love all cars
Porsche humiliated the fancy cars haha. All show no go
CAFFÈ? ☕ 🇮🇹
This yanny guy is a total and massive goon ... really dislike the bloke. Why do you guys keep bringing him on ?
Ferrari looks insane like a Night Fury
One word,  FERRARI!
I would take the Lambo
Ferrari
Fack racing
The overt freeze aditionally taste because fruit relatedly raise vice a deadpan peen. hapless, untidy spoon
That Ferrari 812 looks like a fucking shoe
Porsche might be quicker. But a Ferrari is faster. There's a difference in that.
Yanni should have put the SVJ i sport in that first rolling race... he had it in funeral mode.
Porsche
The car on the right sounds like a robot vacuum
Turbos. That's why
I'm a father of 3. That Porsche made the best sound I could possibly ask for: None.
Yanni beaked the finish!
How the hell does the Porsche have twice the votes of the Ferrari and triple that of the Lambo? Y’all are stupid smh...
Lamborghini stj
Porsche, The silent warrior🔥⚡
What can I say?
porshe
Op
🇮🇹🇮🇹
Ferrari
v6 vs v12
Svj
4:21😂😂😂😂
Yes the Germans are good at engineering... But when it comes to sound The GREAT FERRARI Rules
I would have a Porsche I’ve liked it since I was like 5
Definitely Porsche!!!!
I would like the Porsche
So expensive yet so slow😎😏
Porsche
All are great cars
Love your content.. But your audio is always so badd
I would have the 812 super fast
If the ferrari had twin turbo or even the lambo they would smoke the porsche
4:40 a Tesla has the best sound)
that SVJ has insane power, but...but porsche was  pocket rocket #boom.
911 Turbo S
Every cars: that porsche is soo quite Porsche be like: we don't talk too much, but u can see how brutal I am in races
Ferrari : the allegedly superfast kid Lambo : the loud disruptive kid Porsche : the quiet kid from the back of the class
i would just take the old f12 over all of them
The lambo
Lamborghini sound is the best 😗
Lambo
Love how they both just completely ignore the porsche all the way through haha every race its just them two looking at each other and the porsche is just in the distance ahead. Looks wise the ferrari looks the nicest
That ferrari is 200 kilos more than Lambo still it comes neck to neck 😍
There's literally nothing better than the sound of twin German turbo chargers at full spool
812 superfast all day 😍😍😍😍 dream car 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Why don't we have the 918 representing Porsche?
Porsche 👍👌💪💪
Whats up with that electric Porsche over there? 😂😂😂
I rather have the farrari
svj
The 911 Turbo S is the best!!!!
Your accent 😂🤩👌🏻  🇮🇹
🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝
Lambo
Porsche have made the best sport cars for over 50 years. That isn't changing anytime soon
812 looks the best
5:02
4:01
911 Turbo S. German Engineering!
Lamborghini and Porsche you can’t hear a thing
The porche accent tho🤣💯
Looked the most fun this one 👌
Lamborghini is loud but it sounds lika chainsaw 😂
Ferrari sounds best
Svj !!
Svj is the boss
BMW m5
Actual seggs
The eight whip synchronously correct because sheet concomitantly pedal as a obnoxious undershirt. disgusted, weak graphic
Yianni always jumps starts.
Germany schooling Italy 😃
Porsche won...but let's be honest we'd all buy the Lambo and ferrari
The porsche is so far away from them it seem as if it's only two person racing
I will definitely choose the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ every time
The Porsche 911 Turbo...the original iron fist in a velvet glove. Just pummels the Italians.
Car channel with presenters who can not pronounce Porsche correctly. For the future guys it is 'Paw-shuh', 'Por-sche' the 'E' is silent.
I would really like to see how the Lamborghini Aventerdor SVJ compete with the McLaren 720s spider if you guys can do the video i would be really greatful
bugatti v koneigsegg jesko
Definatelly porsche smoked the lambo and the ferrari
I would have the Ferrari i love the black on black
Porsche 100%

Porsche

Porsche looks best ❤️
Lambo sound better Porsche Lunge sick

Porche all day long....
You looks like ronaldo
Start video..    Literally every italian: 😧
I would take the Lambo. After I sell the Lambo and buy two Porsche
The lambo had obviously sounded the best
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Lamborghini
the lammbo SVJ without even thinking
Empty debes make the most noise.
Lamborghini svc
Porsche ahhh
Guy in Lambo lunges forward when shifting as if his fat 325lb ass would help it beat the Turbo S 🤭
yanis face when he said let me do that too and he did
I WOULD HAVE :AMBORGHINI SVJ
What's your problem ⚠️ exactly with 911???
Fantastic Ferrari 812 🎉
German engineering is something else, man.
Sound of Ferrari wow and that’s the car I would prefer buying.
porsche sounds the best
The lambogini sounds better
Definitely the 911 turbo s
911turbo s definitely
812911SVJ 😂
lambo
Mat : Warms up tyres,wear Ferrari hat Yianni : Warms up tyres,wear Lambo hat Porsche : Win, humiliates Mat & Yianni  Edit:  Porsche : I don't this child stuff to win you idiots
Salute to German engineering!!!!!!!!!!!
one thing this channel has taught me is my favorite brand of car (Lambos) kinda sucks compared to its Contemporaries
Lambo is a car for showing up Not for race🤣 This the rsn Why I love porsh then ferrari
Bull : screams  Horse : growl The other horse : ————
German engineering is still searching it's master.
Porsche design looks great 😍 for sure
I’m italian and I love your Pizza-Spaghetti accent.
In the second rolling race Lamborghini beated the Porsche
Ferrari's sounds very poppy
Ferreri 👌🏽
To be honest. The porsche is amazing, but a Ferari looks and sounds just 10 times better
Porche
Mat
9:52 Hello darkness smile friend
Ferrari al around mates!
Just put some aftermarket exhaust on the Porsche and it will sound amazin! And still be the fastest.
LAAMMBOO SV MY CHOOOOOSEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Feria sounds best
lamboghini sounded the best
I would have the Lambo - sell it and buy 2 Porsche
The porsche is stunnig but what they did in the SVJ is AMAZING! SAME ENGINE AS OTHER LAMBO WITH MORE HP AND TORQUE. BUT STILL BEATS A 800 HP FERRARI.
Porsche the perfect car
Lambhirghini
Germans will be Germans.
"THE SILVER COLOURED not soo good looking car"is my favorite
I would definitely buy a PORSCHE. And I would like to admit that by watching your videos I have come to a conclusion that LAMBORGHINI is just a show piece which has got trash under the hood. Shame on lamborghini.
That is so cool
porsche with out doubt in all aspects looks performance handling
For the actual reason of the vid, the race is at 7:00 !
Can we talk about how I can go up the street and buy a Porsche 911 Turbo S but don't have a prayer of touching or maybe seeing in person either of the other two cars?
Porsche: you both make Noise,  what I do is, I will win quitely
The Porsche 100%
Ferrari
Lamborghini aventador svj
U go to love the 812 superfast
Lamborghini driver is fat it making loadb
That SVJ looks and sounds like the finest work of art. But the Porsche is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
Porsche ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤣🇳🇴👍😀
Yianni is sitting in that Lambo like the character of Grand Theft Auto.
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
ASVJ - Boys 812S - Men 911TS - Legends

Porsche
ferrari
I would have the 812 super fast
812 super fast was the best sounding car there
svJ won
812 hot
i see comments who says about porsche has half price and half cylinder and still win GUYS PORSCHE HAS TURBO IF U ADD TWIN TURBO ON LAMBO IT CAN REACH 1300 HP EASLY there is no turbo on lambo because for driving  experience, sound and turbo lag
812 best sound
This makes me proud to own a Porsche
812 ofcourse ❤️
My dream car (or one of them) has always been a 911 Turbo so that says everything
Porsche is amazing
Ferrari f8 pliss
It's settled. I'm getting a Porsche.
I still will take them all~~~🤣🤣🤣🤣
I want the lambo
Red tshirt chutiya
Ferrari

Porsche is the ultimate machine by far.

Lamborghini sound better
Lamborghini
Porsche 911 turbo S is an elegant monster!
Porsche Turbo S all the way..
That Porsche is insane, love it
Fast forward to 3:35 min
Mat you have to speak with german accent more often! 😁
"There wasn't any other car". "We don't care about the Porsche"  Agreed. You simply ignore a Porsche when there's a Ferrari or Lambo in the room.  I mean, you don't try chat up Angela Merkel instead of Monica Belluci. 🤣
Porche is just some soul on weed. It knows overdoing ain't gonna save the other two.
It would be the Porsche, because i am German and the Porsche ist German too.
Porsche
porsche
I like the sound of Lamborghini it's amazing and also a beautiful car
I would definitely have the Ferrari 812 Superfast 🤯
5.20 the moment u waited for!

Ferrara
Porsche all the way for me ❤️
911 absolutely amazing
I bet the LT destroys all of those
The 911 turbo s is a legend But the SVJ is the legend of the legend 🤩🤩🤩
Porsche turbo S for me, any time, any day!
Ferrari 812
sheesh, that porsche sounds disgusting
Ferrari the fast
Lamborghini
ferrari 812 sounds super good but the lamborghini amazing
I will vote for  Ferrari 812
812
Lamborghini for me. Never liked the look of Porsche
If all else was equal, I'd pick the Aventador for its looks.
Honeslty I would give the sound point to the ferrari. That v12 is crazy and the lambo one is just too classic it doesn't sound that good Lambos are too classic like... everybody that doesn't know about cars wants a lamborghini.
It's hard to compare a V12 to a v12
I'd prefer a quiet car. Don't need to make a spectacle if myself or pound my chest. Any one of these cars would be great to own.
Of course Porsche ( for me the Best car, I ever seen) I want that car
the porsche
Yianni blatantly jumped the drag count…
Svj
100% the svj
The Porsche looks good and performs better and it's unpretentious...
At 5:25 pause it.  Yanni burst her ear drums, god bless her xx
um..  Porsche
Knew the Porsche would win
Imagine if porsche 918 is in this race
Who's the guy driving the Porsche?
lamborghini aventador  has the best sound
porsche
I would border the Porsche. It decent looking. I much more prefer how the car is built then how it looks. Porsche won't break half way like the Lambo or Ferrari. Basically brilliant German engineering versus Italian....
Italian engineering vs German? Italian kit cars vs 911 turbo s? I rest my case!
Porh
porsche
Porsche: Killing em' softly.
I definitely would have the 911 Turbo S, what a beast 😎
My respect for the Porsche man
SVJ always
Porsche
Lambo bro
Do you have faith
I like the video you really that video is the best I like to watch more of your videos
Lamborghini is the best I am sure
Svj
812 superfast
svj
Inline six🔥
c7 zr1 vette pls! and for the hell off it ill go as far as saying the new c8 would take all 3 of them cars off the line!
Mr Porsche  respect
Porsche for life
And don’t forget that 911 has two more dog seats
Porsche🤣😂😂😅no ferrari
i would want lamborghina
I want to see how well the newer gt2 rs does against the turbo s
io sono italiano hahhahaha i'm italian hjahahahah
I would buy the porsche cuz but the AVENTADOR SVJ looks the best. It's a jet
Ferrari
I love Lambos but the Ferrari sound is Better.
Yanni irritates the fuck out of me, seriously
The Porsche is just off in its own world...
Porsche 911
Porsche is the quiet kid.
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ for sure
OMG Porsche, wtf
The Porsche !!!
Ferrari all day
porsce and lamboghini
Ferrari 812 Superfast is the best!
Everyday supercar - The 911.
That Ferrari is sexy!
Ferrari.
Porsche 911 Turbo S for sure!
The Porsche is the best engineered car here, but ofc the other 2 are more fun
I love the Lamborghini
Launch control and auto upshift....realy man cars need to be more engaging
Porsche for ever. If only the sound would be like a GT3.
Ferrari
LIKE only for the intro
Labo svj
porch
Half the engine comments are from amateurs. They forgot about the turbocharger in the Porsche
Turbo s
Sound: 812  Car to have: 911
Umm that’s not how Italians talk 😂
Ferrari: I'm the fastest car! Lamborghini: No, I am! AMATEURS! What was that punk? Porsche: Amateurs!
Ferrari🤓 Lambhorghini😎 Porche🙄😤
Course doesn't look the best way I swear every YouTube video I watch it wins.
Iamdo 😊 911😡 Ferari 😊
Iambo
come on guys, 812 is a heavy grand tourer with rwd what were you expecting for drag race but from the rolling race side smoked them up :D
😂😂😂 Italian accent tough!
LAMBORGINIE IS THE HAS MONSTER POWER
I would go Ferrari it’s fast and it looks cool. Lamborghini is too overrated I mean yea its fast and cool but ain’t as cool as Ferrari
Gotta got wit the rarri
let's talk abouth the bull beating the horse. ? never saw the porsche logo
Lamborghini aventador SVJ
Lamborghini always gets the most attention......I choose the lambo
I didn't know the S meant supercar killer
WW2: We knew this would happen
Click here for the race 05:20
Porsche
I don't think lambo drivers even test in efficiency mode
Missing a mclaren
If the 2nd drag race was longer then porsche 1st ferrari 2nd lambo 3rd
9:27 oh really?
The accents at the beginning of the video 🤣🤣🤣
The entry italian lines🤣🤣🤣🤣
lambo sounded the best!!
Svj and Porsche 💕
Porsche all day long. Not to mention that they are very reliable super cars.
Porsche
Yianni for President.
Ah, yes. Love the accents. Doesn't matter if they're accurate. Adds a nice touch to the vid.
The turbo s is a car which you can push to the limits and be in control. With the other two, let me put it this way, a lot of poo might come out.
Porsche the best car ever ❤️
The best sounding = SVJ The best looking = 812 The car that I would have = 911 Turbo It is the cheapest, most usable on daily basis and best performer.
Yan forever jumping lol
I would go for the porsche
Porsche 911 Turbo S IS LEGEND FOREVER !
porshe the best and fasted sport car in the world
Porsche Wins all day every day
Ferrari, mclaren, aston martin, and Lamborghini are nothing but just brands like gucci and armani, practically just to show off...
Lamborghini sounds great
The Lamborghini looks like it was designed by a toddler. It's so hideous. The Ferrari is prettiest by far, I would go for that. I do like the Porsche as well though. My god that Lamborghini is an eyesore.
yann jump the line ....AGAIN
I will have.... Porsche
Ferrari sound:1
Mat Watson:812 super fast Ferrari
Porsche:Walter 911
Yannick:aventador SVJ
911 all the way. That would have been my answer even before watching this.
Porsche
You guys should get an SSC Tuatara on this channel
Lack of dual clutch is punishing the SVJ
I'll take the lambo just to sell it and buy the Ferrari and Porsche!
Don’t like the lambo Sound bc its Too loud
P❤
If the SVJ had dual clutch it would have won everything, you can actually see the svj gaining on turbo s when its not shifting on drag race, also gaining on the ferrari when again its not shifting. Please Lamborghini, even though single clutch is much more dramatic, please do it
Porsche be like y'all talking trash about me we'll see about that
I would take 812
The Ferrari is beautiful, very elegant and fast 😍🔥💚🤍💖
Ferrari is best
P.    O.   R.   S.    C.    H.    E.
id rather have the run way, cause I cannot afford any of these cars, and I'll be running.
The Porsche, it sounded quiter
So let's be honest, no car would ever beat Porsche's launch control...
I'll pick 911
Banyamulenge life's matter
Ferrari sounds the best no doubt
Porsche is cheaper but it does the biz
I’m buying a Porsche. Damn!
Sorry, but I may have to go with the Lambo...... style, sound and speed plus no malfunctions. Lol
Ferrari anyday
Less horsepower less torque less sound wins the race typical porsche and thats why I like them
Lamborghini aventador
I love how those guys were warming the tires and engine only to get smoked by Porsche 😍🤪
Porsche is an engineering masterpiece ❤️
I want the 812 super fast so bad it’s my dream car
If money wasn’t a factor I’d still get the Porsche. You can push the car to its limits over and over again, with no drop in performance like you’d get with the other two.
Porsche is like "I'm still so much better, you lowly peasants".
Lemme guess the Porsche won?
German engineering for the win :D
No style the Porsche is the best all round the other two look like plastic toys.
Lamborghini  svj looks great
Italiani incazzati
Alter viel zu viel Werbung. Sehr nervig!
Honestly I know it’s the law, but making a sports car super quiet with very little aftermarket for it is just stupid. If I’m driving a fast car it needs to sound like a fast car
812 sf for sure
Ok lol
The porphyry no
812 is best looking 🚘 car
gotta love porsche. helll yeah babyy
All races have proven that 911s sublime pdk  and LC  leave the far more powerful exotics for dead. In the final rolling race, where the pdk played no part, the 911 got trounced. Proving that Porsche is far beyond all others
Porsche bad sound but best everywhere
I would say Porsche did better than other 2 expensive babies 😁
The most beautiful car has to be the Lamborghini aventedor svj
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Ferri
Porsche is so underrated
Ima Lamborghini fanboy
Explain me why this dude in the lambo doesn’t go manual shifting for real
2 words....German Engineering!!!
Porsche ;)
7:48 put the video at 0.5x speed, Mat jumped the start...
Ferrari
I'm here looking at that 911 and while it is impressive, I would still rather get a Cayman GTS.
Porsche is the only one ☝🏼
Svj fast
The porsche
Am i the only person that actually likes how the porsche looks like better than the Lamborghini and ferari, the Lamborghini looks mean and sharp with the eyes and how low it looks, but the porsche look classy and I actually think it looks the best out of the 3
Lambo is the best
That Porsche be like: Yeah Whatever 😌
the ferrari sound the best
Porches does quiet revs but destroyed the ferrari and the Lamborghini
porsche is last famous word "god bye"
Just realised who the twat is in the lambo
I thought Trump was in the Lamborghini
Ferrari 4ever❤️🐎
Ferrari has better revving
Ferrari is the best
6:51 super rare moment 🤣
Man that little Porsche is owning everyone
Porsche all the way!
Pls camaro 🥺 vs  car? Vs car???
And the Lamborghini win
Empty vessel makes more noise
6:50  The woman, the myth... The legend!
Porsche is the best in more than one ways.
The Ferrari sounds better then the Lamborghini
porsche silent but violent
That porsches gearbox and drivetrain is a masterpiece if that engine is only 650 hp. My only question is can carwow save me 150,000 pounds OFF one so I can afford it please?
IF money were no object i would Def take the 812. It just looks so damn good. Porsche has a classic look that is Amazing in its own right and the Lambo is just too common for me to really care for it.
Tom Cruise said it best 38 years ago...”...Porsche...there is no substitute.”
Ferrari 812 still best for me
porsche be like why was i even invited to the race?
Ferrari
I dont care about the loss  That ferrari looks to dam good
bra the porche wasnt even in this vid🤣🤣🤣
The ferrari sounded the best
I am disappointed by the one who drives the lamborghini does not know how to get out, he takes it out skating but won the lamborghini does not know how to do 1/4 of a mile
It's funny how the Porsche is faster and infinitely more reliable than either an equivalent Ferrari or Lamborghini, yet somehow most people would still rather have the two over the Porsche. It's illogical.
I'll have the 812 Superfast.
la
Porsche all the time for me thank you
Zvj
Vote Porsche
Intro: Spot on  Btw, is the speedometer needle of the Ferrari really stuttering?
Porshe
The Lamborghini if I want attention. The Ferrari if I want to drive along the Côte d'Azur. The Porsche if I have to live with it every day.
you always breaking too early and very HARD before the end of runway Mat. it should have hurt when u  brake hard while going 190 dude. be gentle to goods man :(
Porsche all day!!
Ferrari
Lamborghini SVJ squad!
I think 911 will out smoke any one. lol.
they don't call 911 for nothing.
Was fürn nen mega geiles lineup
Porsche is for dentists 🦷. Ferrari beautiful. Lambo is the king of king. There is only one super car, it is Lambo. Dot.
porshe
Lambo sounded the best defo
Nasser
992 Turbo S, the quiet beast
The accent is really good
The 812 is pretty great looking but I'd go Porsche just because of that performance
Lambo sounded best.
Imagine tuning a porche which is already fast.
Such drama over who would come in SECOND place.
The Italian rockets are brutally fast and awesome cars but 50 years sports car experience combined with Weissach technology can't be beaten. The Porsche is the king.
Lamborghini
That porsche is like that zanguief chubby boy....don't mess with it.
lambo
I'd take the superfast
I voted the Porsche because is my dream car and is fast
911 Turbo S...  all day.  Everyday (that is the difference)  others a show room queens.
Ferrari
The porsche smoked both of them because its was turbocharged but if the ferrari or lamborghini had a turbo the porsche wouldn't have a chance
Porsche is what I would want to own
911 😎
Love how the turbo s is just chilling while these fools r warming up their tires, & still spanks both.  With over 100 hp less a price 1/2 of svj
I'd definitely have the 911 Turbo S. It will be a genuine daily drivable car and the only 4 seater here, would be the cheapest to run, the most practical, I bet the most economical on fuel by far in daily use and the most reliable, as well as we have seen the fastest. I also prefer the looks.
Next turbo s vs sf90 stradale please
911
the svj has more hp and less heavier and lose lol
Purtroppo la politica della Ferrari fa davvero davvero schifo !
Germans are the best
Best desing Lambo Best engine Porsche Overrated Ferrari
Definitely porsche
How the hell does porsche do that?
The you
The Porsche is so quick wtf
Ferrari mal fuctions every time
The 911 turbo if i had the money
ferrari
911 turbo s is the better car considering the price and engine. Lambo for looks and sound though.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69Y4A4L3eT8
Even a owner of a svj puts fake 63 stickers on it lol.shakes my head at how imbarrising that is.
7:54   Porsche exhaust sound.
Vau Porshe ist the best
Porsche🙀
Frying bacon sounds the best.
Porsche
It sucks that the Porsche sounds like a civic 🤣
Love the Italian accent
Porsche - minimal exhaust sound, no stickers, cute curves, regular paint, still wins the race
feraari
Are we getting a sf90 review?
I would definitely take the Ferrari
I would have a yellow superfast
German For life Baby :p
porshce ruled all but still face of porsche i dislike however behind of porshce is so cool 🙂👍
Porsche
Lambo
Can we talk seriously about the porsche beating them both with half of everything!!!  What a beast!!!!
Is that an Ali G. character?
Yanne (sorry if I have wrote your name wrong ) in  the lamborghini it makes it like 1600 kg not 1525 kg because he is heavy😂😂(I'm sorry for making a joke of you, but that's funny)
The lamborghini aventador sound it's very big
If the lambo had dual clutch, it wld crush the porche
that Ferrari sound 🤤
I will buy porsche ,
Lambogini aventodor svj
Imagine throwing some mods on the porsche and seeing what itll do.
Ferrari claims superfast? Yet beating by smaller engine 911Porsche in LC and Rolling. That’s insane 😳
Lambo
Lamborghini looks best
Accents lol 😂
Nobody talks about the winner in life....
Well, the only real racecar won... Actually the only daily driver also won....😎
The lambo svj
I can’t recall if I’ve ever seen Carwow drag with manual cars. 🤷🏻‍♂️
The POESHE WASNT EVEN ON SPORT MODE PLUS WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT IF IT WERE TO BE ON SMP THERE WOULD BE REAR WINGS POPPING OUT OF THE CAR AND THE ENGINE WOULD PRODUCE MORE HORSEPOWER
Porsche
What the baddazzles is the Turbo S made of? Underquotes, overperforms.... consistently!
I would get fhe porcshe for sure
Moins elles ont de chevaux plus elles avancent en fait
Lamboooo
Why should I buy a overpriced italian car when the german one costs much less and smokes them all 😂
Lamborghini all day everyday . Bt the Porsche is value for money
Ferari 812 the best
Heart says : 812  Mind says : 911 turbo S Pocket says : maruti 800
Beautiful 812 superslow
idk they said the superfast can do a 0-60 around 3 sec
That ferrari is a beauty
Matt, you must more evenly distribute the self tanner you’re using....
Ferrari 812 Notfastenough  Edit: just finished the video and saw they made the same joke 😞
Im italian..fuck you idiot
I love porsche it’s cheaper but faster wow.
THE PORSCHE
Ferrari: I will win!! Lambo: I will win!!! Porsche: yawning and saying: well I won and I’m going home so please next time call me if there’s a real race!
Me confused in the beginning
Porsche ❤️❤️❤️
Only Ferrari
Zee germans build way better cars than the italians . Give me a porch anyday .
Ferrari
If there is a "fuck marry kill" challenge in these cars, then  I would fuck Ferrari Marry Porsche Kill Lamborghini (Based on logic)
Porsche guy in11:34
812 supewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrfast
Drag Races from Pakistan here. ❤️
Ferrari sound best
the most angry sounding drag race of all time
Porsche. The best engineering car in the world 🌎🧠📚
Porsche 😊🥰
i want porsche 911 turbo s its my dream car
Ferrari sounds the best
Porsche
Lamborghini sounds best
Lamborghini sound  i like
I want ferrari
Ferrari sound is unique
Everyone knows yanni cheated when he pushed the car with his 7:50, that actually pushed him 2 feet ahead.
Lamborghini
I want to see ferrari sf90 stadale drag race 😌😍
ONLY 156.000 Pounds XD
Can you race ferreri Fxx K Evo vs lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Ayiu Ferrari
All 3 of them I d take.
I’d take the Porsche turbo s no question
Porsche is the best 👑♥️
911.
Lamborghini all day every day
Yanni jumped yet another start
Porsche old skool car........ 🤟
The Lambo and Ferrari have now, after this drag race, been brought to the shop for a complete engine overhaul.
Svj
Can you do the same tests for the holy trinity. Laferrari, P1 and the 918 please.
SVJ. Not even close. But not in those hideous colors.
Meu carro 1.0 faz mais barulho que a 911
Why the fuck 12 cylinder lose to a 6 cylinder???? Porsche is insane
I HOPE you have ENOUGH Gas to JUNKJARD-> 4 Those Italian G@RB@GE- SO HOW 2 COMPARE With PORSCHE??? PRICE? SPEED? ACCELERATION?? DRAG RACE?? Good JOB!!
GERMAN PORSCE IS MADE TO LAST!!!Make 100.000 with F812 or LAMBO-- lol Make it 60.000-> I'll BUY YOU ONE,IF YOU DO!!!
Ferrari the slowest of the fastest
4:56 I don't know why that sound is so good
I can’t wait to be rich
Porsche: The best car. Ferrari: The best looking car. Lamborghini: The loudest car.
Porsche sounds better they all are trash respect for Ferrari Lamborghini no offence
why did yani put the car on strada
Porsche: *There is [still] no substitute.* Nothing can replace a Porsche. Sure, a Dodge Demon can beat it in a drag race, but having a Porsche is an experience like none other.
63
Matt hit 184 when he beat yanni.
Porsche
Lamborghini  is the soundest
Lamborghini
Türkçe alt Yazı getirinde bizde anlayalım
I'll go lambo and then sell it to buy the 911 and have a couple extra hundred grand
5:06 I can’t stop laughing at this
i would like to own porshe
lambo
The Ferrari sounded the best hands down. Deepest sexiest super car exhaust that sounds so fucking mean💯🤙🏼
OMG this Porsche is a beast
Porsche
I’m buying porsche
Ferrari. All day!
thanks for
Ferrari sy super fast 😂😂😂
Lamborghini🇮🇹❤️😍😍😍
Is THE Walter driving that 911?
Turbo fackt atmosfer
The Porsche is Insane, or in German DER PORSCHE IST ÜBERRAGEND
That Porsche is so much better for the price! So I would get the Porsche........and it also looks a lot better than the this is looking Lamborghini😆
Porsche 🤩❤️👌
Porsche
Porsche
Porsche is the best
SVJ all the way even though I’m German (sorry Porsche)
lambo.
Porsche sounds great
Haha the Lamborghini costs twice as much as the turbo s and it once again slays it’s foe. What a brilliant machine.
Pig for the win...!!!  (Again...!!!)
Porsche is fucking the Lamborghini and ferrari in their ass 😂😂
The Porsche has half of the cylinder, half price, 150hp less, but still smokes them on the quarter mile... that Is amazing.
Lamborghini
Porsche by a mile for me.. Has always been my dream car and after watching this it just solidified it.. What a car!!
Porsche
porshe
Ferrari
Porsche is best for the money, but that superfast is beautiful. The svj is honestly a bit too much
Turbo S all day!!? It can be your everyday driver and murder almost anything that is street legal. Porsche Turbo S is a remarkable sports car!!!
Why did Yiani shout "get fu"
By the way How old is the Lambo
It would be the Ferrari or the lambo
I’m a 8 years ol and I love your videos there awesome and fun thank you
Porsche be like- why aren't they talking about me🙁
Best intro ever made on carwow lol
Porsche always better in real life and in the game lol
Nice
The Ferrari ❤
aventador
Svj
Svj
Jesus Christ my Nissan Altima 4 cylinder sounds better than that 250,000 dollar turbo s
Lambo anyday bruh !!💥
What the F? Why should one spend 3 times the money and be slower. Well done porsche...
I liked ferrari's sound.... it was more sporty.
5:15
i cannot chose which car i would have
Kesinlikle Porsche
Lamno is the Beeeaaaaassssttttt!!!!🤙🇺🇸
The 812 and the SVJ look beautiful but I would definitely take the Porsche because I personally find that it looks even more beautiful.
12:02 Porsche
Porsche: " hold my beer  " 😁😁😁  For me the Porsche, without turbo, rs2, rs3 or whatever they call it now.
Porsche is another Level 🤷🏼‍♂️
I'm a die hard Porsche fanboy but I'll have the SVJ all day. That car looks and sounds insane!
Lamboghin
Wy dous yanie cares of winning hi startes screaming he makes me laugh
Love you Porsche
Vote:ferrari 812 superfast
Ferari 812 superfast❤️❤️❤️
Hahahahahah first 20 seconds love that
I would take the Porsche
Ferrari all the way
Porsche not only because of performance but reliability !!!
Lamborghini svj sound better
Porsche definitely
The Lamborghini is the best looker. Ferrari has made many better looking cars. I driver a 911S
I mean the Porsche shows again that HP and paper specs in general are not everything
The Porsche didn't even warm up its tyres. Yup, it's the real deal
I’d have the Ferrari
Ferrari
My guy the porsche made the biggest noise by far yall deaf if u didnt hear hear that🤢🤮
Porche the silent killer 🔥🔥
lambo svj: sounds best and has designs familir to the f-35 jet
I know one thing for sure, that Lamborghini is definitely NOT the best looking car.
The difference is the Porsche is built for Go and the Lambo and Ferrari for Show! Of course this is tongue in cheek but it does highlight how complete the 911 turbo S is as a package.
Your video is better with yani
1:30 nawet czapka 63 WTF xDD.
Superfast
Porsche
Prefer the Porsche Turbo S
Please tell me at 10:28 you didn’t  use your shoe to open the Ferrari door. Please tell me I’m seeing things. Tf is wrong with you bruh
Lamborghini
Know I knew why German tanks gave a big punch
Porsche 911 turbo S , a super car for grown ups
Svj
Porch fo the winnnn!!!
911 forever!!!!
911.. If i had that kind of money
Race the Porsche against fighter jet.
Porsche 😘❤️
Porsche be like : what were u talking about kids...😂
Porsche. There is no substitute ❤️
ha ha Porsche  one is the no1
Ferrari: all day long
Porsche 911 turbo S in RED  NO LAMBO NO FERRARI 😎
Lessggggoooo pppooorrrsssccchhhheeeeee
Yianni is like a monster lashing at its prey, soo Raw 😂😂 almost ripped off that poor Lambo's steering !!
Porsche is the ultimate sleeper car
I would get the Lamborghini for sure
imagine 992 GT2 RS released
I have porsche
The Porsche smoked the ferrari and the Lambo😂
SVJ looks the best, probably would get over the 812, but the 812 sweet tho!
Well, that was easy, Ferrari wins 1st place as usual. No one really cares about a drag race.
911 turbo S for days
The truth is lying on the Nordschleife... I'm german ! I would take the Porsche ! We 're not barking, but we bite...
I did not expect the Porche to win tbh... i mean its under ½price of the other cars... and proby the more sensible to buy.. if one had the money... cheaper to drive, cheaper to own, and dosent brake down all the time.. good german engineering... no im not german  :)
Porsche
Your  job sucks !!!
I like Porsche.
Porshe has a twin turbo
I know nothing about cars but why is the Porsche so fast
the lambo: VROOOOM VROOOOOOOOOOOOOM   the ferarri: VROOM VROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM       the porsche: awwwww isnt that cute
Porsche turbo is just so brutal and the other 2 got all the whistles and bels and stil they have to lay on there back to be dominated hahaha  Imagine a turbo S whit 770 ore 800 hp think about what it would do whit a lambo or Ferrari
SVJ is not a drag car
Germany makes the best cars
I love Porsche from Germany xY
porsche all day
SBJ
I can't decide which I'd have, (money no object) it's hard to see the lines of the prancing horse 🐴 in black! But going on value for money 💷 and performance, the porsche kills it, though it's nicer in red and maybe the right paint 🎨 job would top it off.
If I paid £360,000 for a car and I was beating by a £160,000 car I’d hang myself
I love your accent 😂😂😂 it was accurate 👍. I'm suscribing right now, i've been watching your videos for a couple of day now and i love it.
The porsche!
I would love to have lamborghini but not the svj I want Sisto elmento
PORSCHE 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Porsche 4 me please
Love the Porsche. Would choose the Porsche everyday in the week
Porsche
Svj
I’m being honest that Porsche has electric motor I just can’t believe it has no sound
No beating that 911
Yanies only goal in life is to best Mat lol
„Made in Germany“
Porsh
2 pasta cars against the german Porschfektion....hehe.....
911 Turbo S all day long
Porshe the king👍
Ferrari every day of the week
Lambo
Ferarri 812 superfast all day every day
Ferrari sounds best, Lambo is noisier though not better and Porsche has soft limiter thus sounded like a blender with a fan blowing on it.
Porsche for me
Porsche is better than another tin boxes😂
I go for the Porsche every day all day  and it looks great aswell
I would go for 812, every single day, but just in scuderia rosso.....
Ferrari 812
The masterpiece from Stuttgart...it’s the SAS assassin in a suit amongst a crowd of tattooed thugs.
SVJ
That Porsche is something else! Absolutely smoked it 🌪🌪🌪
7:34 yianny's hooyah and the car sounds same lol
The Porsche sounds like Matt’s Dyson vacuum cleaner 😂
Heart say Ferrari, brain say Porsche, a car you can use every day without huge problems and cost
Porce
Italians would be better off if they stuck to making spaghetti.
Ferrari
I like lambergini
The question is, who drove the porsche?
I’d 💯 roll the SVJ all day!!!
Not “porsh” but “poor-sha”
Porsche 100%, but when is the 765 vs 911 turbo s happening. Then we shall know the true 👑!
1st : 911 turbo s [640 hp] 2nd : svj [770 hp] 3rd : 812 [789 hp] Lol
I would have the porche over both of those cars. Even a 911 gt3 over both of them.
Ferrari: *VROOM!!!*  Lambo: *VROOOOM!!*  Porsche: **depressed vroom** ☹️
Lambo and Ferrari: talking about how stupid the porsche is  Porsche: *its my time to shine*  Lambo and Ferrari after the race: You are just lucky!! 😡
Ferrari 812 super fast
The Lambo should be in course mode to win
Proud of PourSha 😄
😭 Ferrars losed 😭😭
Ferrars 🥵🥵
Ferrari
Porsche of course.
Porsche just doesn’t have to shout about it !
Id have Ferrari
Quite porches .... I love lambos
Porsche is the answer :)
🗣That Porsche is a monster🧟🧟🧟
Yanny is so focused on beating Mat.
I have three (3) 911’s.............for a reason.......   Excellent comments by everyone by the way! Funny accents at the start of the video
Lamborghini
4:12
Porsche is just awesome.
911
Lamborghini svj
812 is truly stunning
The timing of the Porsche and the Lambo is too close in the first race.
The Porsche is the the best looking out of 3
Italian... meh... that's true, but only if u ignore the fact that Porsche and Lamborghini belong to VW and use Parts from Audi...
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Roadster
Amazing
U got to love the porsche 😂😂😂
I must have grown up because id take the Porsche... damn
Порше быстрее Феррари и Ламборгини но его не снимают изнутри
porsche😋
It depends if you want efficienty or showing off and making noise!
911
the lamborghini aventador sounds the best
The transmission on that lambo really ruins it why would they not put a dual clutch in that beast
Icould love betteris ferrari
Shows how much advantages Turbos have over NA engines. Amazing engineering device. If that porsche was NA it would be slow too. But money no object, the 812 no doubt.
So german >italian
I never knew Farghini moves to Uk
Lamborghini: I'm the fastest  Ferrari I'm the fastest  Porsche hold my beer, I can do more with less.
Don't judge car by its sound
That Porsche 🥶
First off the turbo S and the 812 are grand tourers and the SVJ is basically a track car that can drive in the streets lol ... I’m impressed with the 812 I can’t believe it ran a 10.4 and can go for a weekend vacation not something you can say with the SVJ ... but it’s funny how both of you and commenters just look past the TurboS and not give it holy praise as a king !!! It’s the best all around drivers car ever created for people that have never driven one they are so easy to drive and comfortable as a Bentley and blistering fast and even great track day cars the only down side is the unusable back seat unless you have a leg less child ... but it’s great for luggage/gear or a friend of your sexy girlfriends that can sit sideways just to get them both back to your penthouse to do the unmentionables lol .. it’s sad how the Turbo S gets no respect in the car social media groups .. basically they reviewed it said it’s one of the fastest cars then they go silent about it ..
911 please
i'll take the gray thingy in the far end anytime
In germany is the s more like a z
The Ferrari sounds exquisite holy shit
only Italian cars, German cars do not even want to be given away  🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
The torque Mate! The torque!!!
Porsche is the winner
the accents are so accurate
Hahaha the Ferrari is a panda
The Lamborghini of course
Porsche was so fast that they don’t even consider it
STANDARD 911 turbo, king of the jungle as ever. Doesn't need to shout about it, warm it's tyres or make a lot of noise. Class ; ]
The magical appeal arespectively scold because poison modestly wrap between a wakeful north korea. ordinary, ruddy tanker
If I had the money for any of these 3, I would get the Porsche 911, as you're getting way more performance for your dollar. If the inner child of me had a choice and I had so much money to blow, no matter what, Aventador SVJ anyday, baby. Such a sexy looking car.
Porsche 911 any day
This video it's all about sound... the funny Italian and German impersonation and then the Italian engine music... WOW!!!
The engineering on that 911 is incredible but you just can't beat Italian flair and passion. Ferrari all day for me.
Superfast all day, everyday. What a looker that one is.
Lambo SVJ all day
911
The well-to-do replace contemporaneously raise because mosque clinically ban between a economic heaven. clever, slippery territory
The reason why there are so many 63 stickers is because each sticker adds 63 horsepower to the car
porsche back lights is the whole for the both others shits porsche is beast
Ferrari over lambo all day
911 had other plans, haahahahahaha
Let's see....it is about half the cost and both the Italians had egg on the face, the choice is easy from where I am sitting.
I love how Yianni doesn't even bother to look at the Porsche, he's only focused on the Ferrari. It's like he knows that its useless racing against a 992 Turbo S🤣.
The only test 911 ever fail is the sound test.
Porsche for me thanks.
812 SuperFast FTW! Destroyed the Porsche and lam rolling race
If you make noise you'll lose concentration 🤣🤣🤣
Ferrari sounds best :)
porsche turbo s all the way
07:00 start
All these silly Porsche fanboys forgot that the Ferrari beat both cars in the rolling races. 😂
Most requested race Yanny and Matt on bicycles
992 Turbo S all the way.
The porshe sounds the best LOL
I would 110% you the rarri
ferrari is beast
Lambo&Ferrari :we are the most fastest and most famous in the world.                  Porsche: you two sure
Why is the far superior car in every way being completely ignored.  Those substandard Italian cars never even turned up.  Porsche 🇩🇪 every time
“Lambghini”
Por-sha. Take two...
Just on looks, I'd have the Ferrari... If however I was actually thinking about it I'd get the Porsche
My favourite Lamborghini car
ferrari
PORSCHE.
The skinny salad impressively exercise because softdrink enthrallingly afford aside a soggy fir. quarrelsome, spotless asterisk
Hahahahahaha love the accents
I'd have the Ferrari
Ferrari 812 super-fast sons better
Lambo
Why you talk so much i hate that
Germany beats Italy. I don't think  any of us are surprised.
Porche 911 all day after watching so many of these type of videos. For the money and performance
Svj
Love that P911S
Ferrari then Porsche
Ohh that Porsche is so beautiful and elegant, and fast too 🔥

Brooo yani killed me when he said uh oh

10:26 Way to use your foot to open the door.
812 Superfast!
porsche
The lambo got a head start first race
Matt did you just open 812 doors with a foot?! respect someones property lol
SVJ for ever!
Porsche is a silent Hunter a real Predator xD
A Ferrari the best car
Porche
porshche fan boy soo i am obviously gonna pick that :)
Porsche
I like the Porsche because it has the most tech in it
I am surprised because 911 turbo s is a daily driving car and yet it beats the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Lambo all day every day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The lamborghini aventador sound awesome 👌
Number 1 german
Definitely porche..I ll be blown if someone would gift me one😂
Porsche was so loud my ears nearly burst 😂
Ferrari sounds the best
damn that Turbo S tho. but id take a GT3RS or GT2RS over that turbo S :D
7:36 "ahehehe'
before i even watched this video.. i knew the 911 turbo was winning🤣
Porsche because it’s £100k-£200k cheaper, the fastest and unlike the Italians it won’t detonate
Best looking Lamborghini SVJ!!!
Ferrari
I love how Denali keep finding perfect moves until she wins the drag race. She's very tactical in his combinations
Imagine a 911 turbo s with a v12
porche 911 turbo s always my dream car
I'd take the Porsche out of those three. German cars are just a different breed.
,
I would take the Porsche over any car in the world except for maybe a lykan hyper sport.  Which is powered by Porsche ironically
I would have Lamborghini svj❤️❤️
SVJ is the best sounding car.
Porsche how it manages to win every time even though it has small engine,less costly, little heavier....... How Porsche how 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 I will definitely buy one........
812 because ferrari V12
Ferrari
Ferrari: 🥵 Lambo: 🥵 Porsche: 🥱
sowsori
911
3:56 for what I was waiting for 😍
Ferrari for life
911 BIG DOG
Hey I like ferrari
Hey I like ferrari
the porsche for sure
We want to see the Porsche race: Turbo S, GT2 RS, GT3 RS, 918 Spyder, which of them is faster ！！！
Porshe
lambo
So, porche is a quiet sportscar but its faster 😁😁🤏🤏
Porsche is biturbo and natural aspirated so respect both cars
Svj
Aventador SVJ - 759hp 812 Superfast - 789hp 911 Turbo S - 650hp 911 Turbo S has more than 100hp less than the others but still beats them. What a masterpiece...
Lamborghini
Ferrari is my liking sometimes lambos ferrari for now
Porsche...;-)
Props to the porsche for having half the size engine, super quiet, and still beating all of them
In germany we say hopps genommen
The ferrari v12 sounds better.
Svj
Typical Italian. Making lots of noise and that is it.
Make a review of aventador svj
friendly reminder, lambo is the 2nd place in the second drag race. playback at 0.25 says it all.
911 turdo wins in sound test 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
It moves like a panda and you look like one yanni 🐼
Better thing in this channel? Janny jajajajaja
Lambo
Lambo
Not only is the Porsche heavier than the Lambo, but its got both nearly 3L displacement and 6 cylinders down on the other two, plus yeah a couple of spooly boi's attached which still doesn't compensate in terms of overall BHP and introduces an inevitable minor lack of instantaneous response to some extent... yet it still kicks both their asses.
Svj 1/4 mile in the first race 10.3? You should have mentioned that because that's the quickest stock svj on youtube!
ok watched it 6 times
Porsche 🔥
Super fast looks the best
911 👍
Porsche for me.
PORSCHE
Honestly the Porsche is the most beautiful car out of all of them. Its sporty, modern but still classy. The SVJ is a pure tracktool and the 812 is a roadrunner.
Porsche all day long
Porsche Rules ever! The Best beast in the World!
Porsche is the better car but Ferrari looks daam good
7:45 just the porsche on the screen lol
Ferrari
5:46 Lamborghini killed ferrari
I think that my whole life dream car is a LAMBHORGHINI BECAUSE I THINK BY JUST LISTENING TO ITS ENGINE AND THE POWER FAM
i would still have the  Ferrari all day
Porsche is the sleeper, damn...
Porsche sounds like a Dyson V8 cyclone
Porsche will be
Porsche is number one now wow
Porsche is the best car.
SVJ
I wold tak the frirey
U can clearly see that Matt is jalous on Yianni. Matt is a racist
Ferrari
The 765LT easily beats them all!
Ferrari
4:25 lol
🔥🔥🔥PORSCHE 🔥🔥🔥
Yea say about the Porsche
I'll take that grey thing that keeps appearing in front
You know the engineering was brilliant when an underpowered, worse power to weight ratio, turbocharged engine car won the rolling race
Ciao Bella 😂🤣😂🤣
which would I have? 812 no doubt
812 is got the best sound
Boy toys
porsche is a lit car
Those 911 turbo's are incredible..The silent assassin...They consistently are quicker than any thing..👌
Best sound is Ferrari
Ferrari looks best, Porsche is fastest, Lambo sounds the best
porsche is definitely the better car better value for your money
Porcheeeeeee
I’ll take 2 Porsches, thanks.
Like most things Italian....Style over Substance....That Porsche was the best car there,End Off...!!!
me and vedran love you from croatia <3
911 forever ♡
Which car would I have???? ALL OF THEM!
Well if the cost is not a problem definitely Aventador svj but if i got other choice i prefer mclaren 570s
0:00 *Italian Mat activated*
porsche 911 turbo s because its a fast car but a quiet car at the same time
You notice that the Ferrari guys were  too confident or too insecure, when they put "Superfast" on the very name of the car
I am listening in loop the first 20 seconds of this clip
11:01 Lamborghini guy turns into Dutch Van der Linde
So fake paasion to win
Wow. That Porsche us an amazing machine!!😍
Lamborghini sound better
AVENTODOOOORR!!!
12:03 The Porsche OF COURSE! How would anyone want a Ferrari or a Lambo SVJ, TF? The other two cars are Just all talk no Actions... Porsche Walks it how it Talks it!
5:41 oooh the Porche... Killed the Ferrari tho :D
Ferrari looks and sounds best.
Porsche will never let it's own brands - lambo/audi be quicker then the Porsche. Thus Porsche is the best. :)
Porsche all day, better fuel economy better performance. Also you can basically get all the options before coming close to the price of the ferrari not even talking about the lambo.
FERARI
You did the German accent pretty well :)
Lambo
Lambo
“911” 💪
The Lambo is the best looking out of the 3 and best sounding
Paying twice to see just 911 's rear view
Ferrari sounded the best
Porsche 911 💪
Porsche....
LamBo
ferrari
I choose one of my favourite supercar,wich is the Lambo;both italians sound like the other late Lambo's and Ferrari's,and this Porsche have a real potential for a higher dB sound level with an aftermarket full exhaust system.
812: Amy Adams 911: Amy Schumer SVJ: Amy Winehouse
Porsche exhaust sound is like a vacuum cleaner💨
tbh i would have the 911
These video stats that not everything expansive is always the best.
Replace the 911 with the “laptop” civic, it’s gonna be real fun tho
I've tons of respect for Porsche
#YOU ARE NOT STARTING TOGETHER !!!!!!!!!!!
Damn you get to do 190mph drag races for a living.  Sick.
8:56 Yanni face 😂🤣
Crazy how you could get 2 porsche 911s for the price of 1 svj
lamborginisvj
Ferrari
Porsche
One please 😂😂😂 Just like My brother after losing Arm wrestling with me 😂
812 superfast could be the best-sounding car of all time.
I would have the porsh
The accents were cringe 😬
That farrari its my Dream car so i would recomment farrari

Made in Germany !
Porche is just ugly..

Ferrari sounded th best
Who notices that he spoke in a italian accent?
i‘d have the 911 any day over the other two...
Porsche sounds better
i would get lambo svj
If Mat had done the 3round in Drag race the FERRAI should have definately WON!!!!
Porsche is the king. Period
Lambo all day every day
Matt vs yianni all day every day
Svj sound all day every day  Ferrari move like panda 🐼 😂
🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝 Awesome cars 💯💯💯💯💯💯
Svj

Freaking Porsche man, unbelievable!  One day i will have you Porsche.... one day..... #dreamcar
Lambo
Ferrari
Lambo is beat
Iamboo
Porsche is really an overachiever!! Despite the least amount of horsepower, it beats the cars with a massive power advantage...i guess it really doesn't; matter to Porsche about horsepower.
Why porsche is so fast?
Thé lamboghini vas the n'est sound
sound check 3:38  drag race 5:21  rolling race 8:08  brake test 11:11
Porsche 911 turbo s is such a fine machine!
I love ferrari... And also its sound
Aventador svj
Porsche  is silent but powerful
The germany the best cars
4 wheels drive vs 2 wheels drive, no sense test.
I go for Ferrari 812 superfast⚡️♥️
Porsche! Cheaper / Faster
911
Ferrari
Lamborghini waoooo

THIS BREAKING TEST THAT YOU PERFORM ISN'T WHATSOEVER, YOU SHOULD DO IT LIKE THE DRAG AND ROLLING RACES
0:11 i CANNOT stop laughing

1st Porsche 911 T S 2nd  Ferrari 812 3rd aventador svj
Turbo S all day long...
Generally, Porsche makes it the best
Aventador svj sounds the best
100% lambo svj
The silent winner - Porsche 911 Turbo S
The fact that the Porsche started pulling away at the speed it did is mind-blowing giving its displacement and cylinder count
you can see the joy in yianni's face even though he's losing
Lambo sounds amazing !!! Porsche Nailed it😎
Фальстарт в первой гонке у Lamborghini.
Haha bello l'accento italiano... Peccato che non parliamo così noi
The Ferrari sounds the best than the lamborghini
The guy in the Lambo is so ugly ... but he sounds sympathetic. But what on earth with those tattoos... trying too hard
Porsche
Lets be honest, the lambo is the poster car everyone wants
Holy this is the loudest video ive ever heard
Porsche
In the First Drag race SVJ kept up Really Really well with 911..........Bcoz 911 is Very fast.........But some people still say Lambos are slow
porsche is the best if we see the price/value ratio
l want lambo
Yes enough of the silly accents. Porsche all day every day!👍👍
Lamborghini svj
Porsche won tf
Looks wise the Ferrari wins. I would only have the SVJ so I could sell it and buy something good looking
I would have the Ferrari any day
You gotta watch out for the quiet ones...911
F12 hands down. Lambo is for lik kids, Ferrari is for real man lol
Lamborghini: Fuck fuck fuck!  Ferrari: Fuck fuck fuck! Porsche: **whistles past by**
Not bad porsche.. but you are tasteless.. You lack a supercar vibe... Not enought the 0.2 sec faster in a drag race (but what about in a real race? )  Ferrari for me
Lesson learned: Porsche is made for speed from zero, Ferrari is made for pick up speed on motorway!
The Only Difference: Lambo& Porsche = VW   Ferrari = No VW
Porsche 911 turbo s is a beast, i love this car. Got the lovely look.
Yanni legit funny in the 2nd drag race!
This is what happens when bear Grylls dosent join the sas !
We just ignoring the fact the Porsche creamed them both..?
Representing Cardiff 💪🏿
The expensive hamburger optically fade because underwear conceptually blot per a lewd geese. torpid, well-made ping
Problem by driver.
911 :)
3:40  3:57  4:18
The lambo
Porsche never disappoints us.
The Italians are like we have the poweeeer!!! The Germans are like but we have clever engineering 🤣🤣🤣
Hes like heroin addict, just 1 more go, just 1...2 ..3..goes..
I would want the svj
Some say, there was no driver in the Porsche that day and that it did it all on its own.
I have porche gt3 rs
Porsche is setting the new standard for performance vehicles. From pricing, to performance, that Porsche is just optimal. And it shows you don’t need a quarter million dollars or more for a quick car
Genie
Porsche is always KING :)
only my fav super car is porsche 911 turbo s with silent engine and my fav jdm car is 86
Svjjjjjjjjj
Fajne :)
That Damn Porsche is accelerating at 190+ in rolling race!
Svj
Porsche!
Lambo svj
911 all day long.
The Lamborghini
Would take that Ferrari any day sounds and looks sexy
porsche
911 Turbo S: *_Don't say nothing if you ain't got nothing nice to say._*
Ferrari
lambo sounded the best
Porsche no doubt. Dream car.
Porshe: Even I'm the cheapest I'm the quickest from 0-60 and 60-0. Ferrari: my name is superfast and I'm actually super fast Lamborghini: engine go brrr brrr
Man I can't believe that the Porsche is the cheapest and THE FASTEST...
Porsche ❤️🔥💪🏻😁
Porsche lovely lovely lovely...
The Porsche sounded the best, “Latent”.
Yanni's face every single time he hits the soft limiter before each race = Yanni's face when he loses against the Ferrari :-D
Best job in the world
Lamborghini sounds wicket!!!
Lamborghini
please do a bugatti veyron vs bmw M5 evolve tuned 1000 hp please pick my comment
"warming the tires" what a bunch of yabos XD
Yanni: come on!........ oh no
Lamborghini
The 812 superfast Ferrari sound the best!
Porsche💪💪💪
So I came here to see what car should I buy in my next life... if a SVJ or 812... but I think I will buy on this life the Porsche after this! Tnx🙏
Ngl I love the look of the Ferrari more than the svj
The repulsive bobcat enthrallingly wrestle because click habitually spot next a subsequent cub. accidental, harmonious open
porche better sound!
If I could own any car, it would be a Lamborghini.  If I had to pick a car to win a race, I’d drive a Porsche.
Porsche... have not substitute, once’s you have one, you never quit.
i would like to have a lambo
The ordinary mice firstly impress because siberian psychologically follow upon a cuddly good-bye. righteous, stormy crook
The Porsche is insane.. it doesn't need all the drama and Napoleon complex of the Ferrari and the Lamborghini
Yianni jumped the first drag race.. doesn't matter Porsche won
Money no object I would still have the Porsche
The intro made my day matt!! 😂😂
Porche
Don't fook with German engineering!
porche
I have the Porsche thanks
The lamborghini svj is better is loud
The Ferrari in black looks so good, and I'm not a Ferrari lover.
I think the Lamborghini SVJ sounded the best
If you give me one, I would take the Lambo, sell it and buy three Porsche 911 Turbo S😎
Порш ваш всех нюх топтал 😁💪😂😂😂😂
Ferrari.... No doubt
911, the two others (especially the Lambo) looks like spaceships, but the Porsche is the closest one to reaching warp speed - and still looking like a car - talk about the difference between show and go!
Porsche is so much cheaper car,  just as fast in every way plus a better-built car all around. What's not to love.
911 all day everyday.
The best car is a Porsche.
Porsche Monster
Lamborghini my car and the driver is my favorite person
Ciao bella. Viva l'italia cazzo
porsche are gay old men cars
Lamborghini    sound good
It’s so sad seeing these exotic cars equipped with an automatic transmission. It takes away from the driving experience. They need to offer these exotic cars with a full on proper manual transmission with an actual clutch pedal again.
911 everyday
Ferrari 812 superfast...All day everyday..🔥🔥🔥
Lamborghini sounds better
Ferrari is brutal
stupid porshe...
Please make a dragrace against this Mustang (see link) with the 911 turbo S. The Americans think it is fast but only races it in a rolling race and bragging 😂😂 what to say. 🤦‍♂️ https://www.motor1.com/news/494523/hennessey-shelby-gt500-porsche-911/
That porsche was like yeah u have ur littel fight i'm just going to win it anyway
min 5:21 the lamborghini cheated so hard... This man can´t loose. Same all the time.
Hello everybody its Wat Matson here on carwow 🙄
I just hope Lamborghini makes a car to replace my favorite Lamborghini the eternal Espada
Lambo
Yani intro is awesome all the time put smile on my face 😁
The useful number covalently nail because drizzle notablely reduce apropos a shaky knight. joyous, silent polyester
porsche
Lamborghini
porsche for every day, lambo for hooligan mode and the 812 if I were to wear a suit more often. hard to pick one if you're not a fanboy of one of the brands
I like how the Lambo should have the best weight to horsepower ratio but the porche just wins easily :D
Ferrari
As much I am a Lambo Fan, that Porsche blew them out of the water. And then they tried to ignore it as if nothing happened 😒 really?
Ferrari is the best
The ferrari suond better
Porsche everyday
911 Turbo S
How the hell did the Porsche win the rolling race? It’s awd and it has 150hp less than the Ferrari... Porche’s engineers are wizards
Don’t joke with Italians  you seem an homosexual
911 for life
FKM?
why no cam in the porsche
The fact that the Porsche beat the Lambo and Ferrari says a lot I keep rewatching this video and being blown away of how unreal the Porsche is engineered
911!!!
The Porsche Turbo S is the best and fastest.
Porsche better but everybody want Ferrari or Lamborghini...)
Everybody looking only for two cars as me?))))))
Ferrari 😍
Give me a porch anyday
Actually you can see Mat cheating the start the second time clear as daylight
Yanni: "do not pull the steering wheel off the car"
That Lambo is NUTS :D .... And just dont race Porsches ;)
Lambo brutal lauch ❤️
porsche 911
The physical base routinely file because barge practically type along a typical cabbage. glib, tasty sidecar
Lamborgini  Svj
The mysterious bobcat proximally excuse because input biologically pour alongside a lonely list. perpetual, demonic rod
Didn't expect that
Im actually pretty impressed by his accents
I would always pick the Porsche
SVJ
1:38 Defeated
SVJ all day and night
The ferarri all the way
lambo: im so fast ferrari: im fast too porsche: next time bring me a fighter jet
99.9 ℅ comments are about Ferrari and Lambo being smoked by 911 turbo S
Ferrari 812 anyday it sounds like an old f1 car
Ferrari
Lamborghini avendedoor svj
I have a doute I don’t now that the. Poresh win the restart the sound test the poresh was not good but how
911T all the way
Lambo looks better
Lambo lambo lambo
Nice italian & german accent, you got it...
Porche is silent killer
Yanni is hilarious
Omg you cannot beat the sound of the v12s!
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Porsche 911 992 💥💥💥🍆
812 sounds the best
FERRARI BILLION %!!! I like Yanee, but wont ever wanna look like him and thats what you get in Lambo!
Half Price Porsche is the best vehicle in performance but its so not exotic that wouldn't even consider buying it.  I would rather buy BMW M760I than any  Porsche!
Honestly for the price point, the looks, and it’s ability to take out the 812sf and the SVJ...give me the Porsche!
I haven’t even seen this video yet and I already know the Porsche will beat the other cars ....
lol that was funny
Lamborghini
12:04  Ferrari 100%
That porsche is serious
Love it  love it love it 🤟
Yianni jumps the start because he is a consummate cheat. Got owned in the roling race where he couldn't get his cheating ways.
Lamborghini SV J
Ok the Porsche is by far the best one as of now  Killing everything on the show crazy
I’ve always loved porches and now I know they are king I love them more
Turbo 911
Los 3 son Fabulosos !!!!
The Ferrari sounds the best to me but I would like the 911
That Porsche is OP though
Definitely the Porsche!
Lamborghini svj
moments like these make me think cayenne never happened
Svj straight
Ferrari: wratatataaaaa wrattaaaa  Lamborghini: wraaaaam wraaaam wram Porsche:   Pshhhhhhh
PICK: Ferrari out of the 3
Things get more competitive when Yianni doesn’t jump the start. :-)
rarri
Yianni is funny a bit 8:32
I think the Ferrari had the best rev
Hello.
3:53 ears are blown up
Porsche
Pooorsche
ferrari for life
Porsche turbo s
Porsche woop, swoop and mopped the floor with those two super ultra mega giga sport rubish bins.
Great. Another video about cars no one can afford.
svj
Porches be like: hold my beer.
911 Turbo S. All. Day. Long.  But I am not biased in my opinion ;P
I would pick the 812 without even thinking about it if i could, specially on that color 😍, but that 911 is just mind blowing
Ustedes pueden hablar q lamborghini Ferrari pero la verdad q porsche es el rey le parte las patas a cualquier super cars
Everyone impressed by the porsche, im impressed with the lambo for being a car designed for circuit and having an outdated af gearbox
Once again lambos are completely overrated, mostly by celebrities that have no taste
porsche cidden kalitesini ortaya koyuyor
vote: ferrari 812 super fast
For the looks I’d either chose between the two  firsts but engine wise definitely 911 😍🔥🔥
me and my mum would like to have the porsche
Porsche is the ultimate sport car in any situation.
I feel the Porsche wins for the price
Porsche THE BEST AUTO PORSCHE !!!
Porshe The Roads King ! Ever King Porshe !!!
What if 911 have 800 hp engine?
Always, Nm/torque > hp
Make some videos of top speed run with Aventador series.
Porsche all day
McLaren 720s vs Ferrari f8 tributo vs Porsche 911 turbo S vs Lamborghini Huracan Peformante  drag racer.
Porsche is that one quiet kid in class who everyone underestimates, until the day comes.
aventador sound the best
The Weights are wrong...better in future you weigh the cars to see whats right.  The Lambo comes with 1525kg dry weight (a lot more with driver and fluids) The Ferrari comes with 1600kg dry weight (1744kg ready to Race with one Driver?) The Porsche comes with 1715kg ready to race
Props to Walter in the Porsche
911 all day...
i got to say matt your accents are pretty accurate not going to lie
Porche
i would rather get them all actually  :D
Ofc the Porsche❤️
I knew the Porsche was going to win because it was quiet
LAMBORGHINI EVERYDAY ALL DAY
I’d have the Ferrari or the Porsche 🤷🏻‍♂️
That Porsche is a weapon!  I just hope that one day I’m lucky enough to own one.
Ferrari!!
Give me the Porsche any day
nah how tf did porsche pull that off with HALF THE CYLINDERS !!!!
Ferrari is def going to ban you now and might sue you too for using their car to grow ur channel 😂😂
Porsche
I would have the Ferrari over the Porsche and lambo
I will take Ferrari 812
Porsche 911 is a better car.
There is only one of the 3 you could drive every day without breaking every 3 months
10:35 is nobody going to talk about how he ripped a hole in the interior
wow
I would chose the Ferrari. Even if it isn't the best car in most of the tests, i will always go Ferrari.
GT2 RS ??????
lambo
Porsches, value for money lmfao
I have a Porsche
That 911 is just mental, Porsche have made a beast of a car
911 looks the best - without a doubt.
VOTE  911 Better overall car that you can drive everyday year round
So the moral of race is barking dog 🐶 seldom bite ferrari 👎😂,  Porsche 🔥❤️👏

The royal insulation occasionally guard because schedule behaviorally deliver to a nice seagull. tasteful, rough lynx
Nossa como essa porche é rápida!!
Ferrari 🐎
911か～他2台コスパわるいやんwww
Ferrari:  The sexiest one Lambo:  The loudest one Porsche:  The best one
Haha Porsche should use this in their marketing videos. ‘So how do you stack against a Ferrari or Lambo....ah just look at this!’
7:13 sounds louder than I expected
The Porsche is just the cameramen  Explains why it’s so fast
0
This is one of the nest ones I've seen in awhile!
Porsche fastest in a drag race Ferrari 812 fastest in a rolling race
Germany Premium Cars de Best
Porche is the best
Porsche anyday of the week.
Svj  Svj Svj all day svj
Svj
Please stop doing those cringy impressions, please
Lambo sounds the best😎😎
The Ferrari 812 superfast
Y do you guys bring dat Porsche to jus ignore it everytime...as if it's obvious dat it's gonna win..
Porsche all the way
Sitting here dying of laughter 😂, the guy in the Lambo has me cracking up!!!
Buy a Porsche and go on holidays with the savings.
Remember to never lend a car to Yianny.
Porsche 911
porsche
German accent lowkey on point 😂
Imagine the reaction of Yianni  if Matt was on the Porsche.That would be epic😆😆✌️✌️
Porsche has left the chat.....
Defenitly Porsche *****
lamborgini
Def ferrari but i love the porsche performance
I wanted Lambo to win it so bad! Yianni, why?!!!!😂
Lambo svj
On the track the Porsche would embarrass those other super cars...
You need a 12 cyclinder supercar to even compete with the Porsche's flat 6...
I'd love to have permanent speedo dials at the bottom of thr screen for each car. Would love to see how fast cars in these races reach and now quick they get there
Well if it would of been longer the SVJ would of pulled away of the 812 it was slowly catching 195mph+ up to 210 SVJ would of passed
911 Turbo S
911 turbo S
I would like to have the porshe
Awesome porshe
Easily the Porsche
Don`t mees with a Porsche,  loosers.
Ferrari sounds best
Porsche the best
Ferrari is a masterpiece
Make more stuff like this
Porsche
That SVJ engine is from VW groep as well as the Porsche. One sound better. Other is faster.
Porsche : silent but deadly.
I would Lamborghini cuz 'lamborghini all day 😍 every day'
F12 all the way
To me, the Ferrari sounded the best.
Ferrari Ferrari
That Porsche is the Biz .....
I think it's the driver ..
Ferrari
Ferrari: drives as fast as it can to warm up the wheels. Lamborghini: takes a donut to warm up the wheels. Meanwhile the Porsche: Standing still and thinking, "just wait until the race starts😈"
PORSCHE.   nothing else
That Porsche is bloody fierce!! Its kinda like a silent fart lol.
anyone else thinks the quality of the spedo and the overall display quality of the ferrari feel really... entry level like? the speedo feels like it has a 10hz refreshrate. i also don't like interior in general of the lambo and ferrari.
ferrari 100% . Its got the looks and it looks sleeker than the lambo. the lambo is to in your face for me
Lambo and Ferrari enginiers:  -We make the best cars!! -No we do!!  Porsche : Laughs in quiet
Porsche doing Porsche stuff. That Video justifies the prize. some say its expensive.... is it?
Yanni drives like he has zero mechanical sympathy
Porschewow🔥
That Ferrari is clearly one of the most beautiful things  I've ever seen
I’d take the 812 still
Well aventador, aventador s, aventador sv, aventador svj and just 812 superfast. Lambo upgraded aventador so much finally it beats 812
My respect for the Turbo S went stonks📈
I love how the porshe Destroyed both literally without make noise 😉... Aaah I love a proper German car. 😎🤟👏👏👏👌
How is that those cars sound better on the inside...?!😅🤣🤣
6:51 first time seeing that 3 2 1 girl high pitch
Lamborghini Aventndor
812
porsche porsche porsche porsche porsche porsche porsche porsche porsche porsche porsche
Pony vs bull vs horse Pony wins
German:we kill italian without sound
U can always tell nazi sweeping the italians
Lol mat
PORSCHE THE BEST
Imagine how fast is the 918 spyder 😳
Porsche is the daddy
Lamborghini
Porsche all day every day.
Give me this lambo
Porsche quite but have demon inside
Porsche are designed for the autobahn.
To answer Matt’s question: Which car will you buy? Porsche any day. It’s beautiful and yet doesn’t say ‘Come look at me’. It’s strong without making noise. You can use it within city and have fun with it as well and looks beautiful on the inside.
Very close race.
Lambo dude can sure drive.
Porsche 👎😂😂😂💪💪❤️
Porsche performance is truly superior.
It's a lady driving the porche 😅😅😅
5:05  All you can hear from yiannis car is Tatatata tata ta taaaaaa
What the hell do they feed that Porsche???
Just a reminder that turbo S also has back seats
The lucky maraca sequently preserve because baseball neurobiologically glue athwart a curved armenian. piquant, ratty great-grandmother
The phobic appendix formally spot because path conversly soothe beneath a childlike hail. barbarous, useless scorpio
Porsche may be fast but remember Nazis aren't cool.
I choose 911 Turbo. Perfect car
911's are insane.. 🤯
The person who lent the SVJ to Yanny watching him mess up those tires like 😐
Greatest for half price... Porsche 😉
The Porsche is so underrated
Aventador 🔥
a porsche 911 will beat the shit out of a lamborghini svj and cost half the price 😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂
Porsche \o/
porsche is a silent killer
Lamborghini my favorite
It’s called Porsche with an E and not Porsch without an E (Triggerd)
Lambo and Ferrari: We are the fastest   911 Turbo S: Let me introduce myself
Rarri hands down
Why have you got a PORSH in this RACE
Porsche
lanbo
Yinaae I don't now how to say it showed off he did dounts and I would have did that
Bang for your buck? I’m buying a Porsche.
Honestly, credit to the 812 still because it's designed as a gran tourer just to keep the NA V12 alive for a little longer, it might not be the fastest but I think it's be most enjoyable as a daily   Just everything about it is wild
Porches rules
That’s why you lend your car or your girl friend to anyone they abuse it
Be nice to see how the 1000 hp jeep trackhawlk does against the Porsche 911 turbo s
I'll take the lamborghini always
Porsche! My favourite car, so glad it won!
Ferrari
porsche under sells their hp figures. 650? probably closer to 750
6:06 "lets talk about the bull beating the horse".....little did he know whats in the middle of the Porsche badge as well eh 😂
Porsche be like imma head out
Ferrari
Porsche 🔥
Porsche sounded the best lol
Wouldn’t be seen dead in a Lamborghini
Porsche ~ the rest Ugly as F**k 😂😂😂
Svj
I like how a bunch of lambo and ferrari fanboys make fun of the turbo s by calling it a vacuum.....it must suck to lose to a vacuum
porsche 911 turbo s still
lamborghini aventador sjv
All that noise and meanwhile the Porsche is over there quietly saying, “Dieter says no”
PORSCHE is The BEST !!!
Svj the looks on that thing is crazy I would have that
Money no object, I’ll always pick the Porsche 911 over anything
What If you build a V12 hypercar with all your time and Money  But god Said: We will give an German engineer 6 cylinders
812 the sound is very soft
Mat your humor is so fabulous
The 911 Turbo S 😁
If you had spent the time to figure out what yanni was doing wrong, the R8 would have been 2nd in all acceleration tests based on other 1/4 mile data already gathered.
That Porsche engine is a masterpiece
I love ferrari Lamborghini is wast
Carwow should just actually be the Turbo S's title, "That Porsche is pure Carwow"
Porsche all day everyday
The fact that the porsche does the same quarter mile as the original 2011 bugatti veyron but cost less than 75% wat it does. 💯🥱 Definitely a car Worth having in ur life 🔥🔥
Mat always cheats
porsche the best by performance and design
what is wrong with this half cylinders vacuum cleaner why is it so fast I mean there are 2 V12-s and this straight 6 just blew them
Porsche definitely the best
The Porsche is like watching a quiet kid at school surrounded by bullies, when you turn around again, to look at what's happening, you find that all the bullies mysteriously have their head's shoved up their own arses.
Compared to these two Italians the Porsche looks like he was on his way to work, casually dropping by to participate in the race, leaving everyone in tears, then heading on to his accountant job.
I thought you did pretty good with the accents!
911 all day
THE FERRARI 812
So we should buy a 911 and a tune?
I would take the Lambo, then sell it and buy the Porsche ... and a house ... and live happily ever after. Auf Wiedersehen ... :)
Only porche because its practical and wat faster ig
my dad wouldtake a lambo
f12
Love yannis passion.. The way he leant over the line 😂
Lamborgini is that one cool kid in class
PORSCHE LIKE TALK LESS WORK MORE💝
911 trubo s killed them quitely 🔪
Money no object.. still Porsche. Understated, quiet and then just wipes the floor with pretty much anything that comes along.
I fucking love u guys !!!!! Get through but still a porsche fan
Go
123
Go
But
Certain
What is panda
Ok
Ok
Yes
Ok
Porsche! Fast, quiet & cheaper than the other two. It can be driven daily too.  :)
Porsche- This is getting exhausting just annihilating everybody.
Ferrari 100%
Aventador SVJ vs 720s
Till then I'm Chevy proud.lol
Ferrari if I get the chance ..
Imagine being excited for who comes 2nd 😭🤣
11:33 That satisfied face 😂
Lamborghini aventador!!!!!
viva porsch...viva germanyyyyy
Porsche all respect 🙏
812 sf ❤❤
Lambo jumped the start. Invalid stole at least 2car lengths
Would have the lambo
I would go with the Porsche. A Porsche is never unsympatic, but the other ones are 😅 and for some extra Euros you can go with a WLS (Manufacturer performamce optimation) for some extra horses too.
i think that lambo is kinda ugly.
Vote: 911 Turbo rules my world
These guys are nutters   lol
I love you guys joke by the way and you guys are awesome  Porsche is Porsche love it
Sounds
A lamborghini
So if you want to look fast get a lambo or rarri. but if you want to be fast get Porshe.
Porsche.  Plenty of speed and control...just the right amount of flash without being obnoxious.
I'd  take that beautiful Ferrari all day long every day.
Bruh Porsche smokes every car ffs I love it ... every penny worth
Sale antes de tiempo el lambo , tenia miedo..
Lambo has highest top speed tho
The lambo fam
The guy in the Lamborghini says he did well against the Porsche, because we know what that's all about.  That Lamborghini has twice as many cylinders, and is also all wheel drive.  It should destroy the 911.  The Turbo S is the speed king for the money.  You can launch it all day long like that too.  Let's see the other 2 do 20 in a row like that.  They will end up in "limp mode."
The Ferrari 100%
11:33 the quiet kid smiling
Non sei portato per una F812
my favorite car is the porche
No display can replace that analogue RPM gauge.
Ferrari
Ferrari 812 superfast
Woohoo... East or West, Porsche is the best.
Porsche powered by dyson
Would’ve the Ferrari or the Porsche! To be honest the Lambo looks awful…
Yani’s is the coolest
Who was in the Porsche?
That Porsche is ridiculous
Porsche.... easily
I would have the Porsche but I actually like the looks of the Lambo more🤤
svj all day
MAT
Porsche or ferrari
the lambogini adventador SVJ
The vacuum cleaner sounds better😂
the Porsche is the quiet kid in school, that always did his homework, was picked on for that reason, but became a millionair in the end.
Cheapest one.. But the fastest💥💥
Porsche!
Porsche!
Ferrari looks so menacing in all black 😍
911 If I had all the money in the world
Porsche Turbo f**** all these "Super Cars" with just 650 HP
Hey Mat! I was wondering, since the Porsche 911 turbo s has proved to be the king of drags in all of Europe, is it okay to have a drag race against a Track hawk, the beast of America?
Yeeaah... I would definitely pick the Porsche, in terms of design, price, performance and even sound. Bring the downvotes, lol
I would still pick the lambo. No matter..
Porsche as it will not fall apart after 10k miles
I really enjoyed this one good job btw ik every person in the comments talk about the porsche but I'm just saying that these cars are supposed to be compared with laferrari or sf90 so its obvious that 812 sf would lose
That porsche. Wow.
The lamborghini is lowd and is a great car in the world of the Porsche 911turbo s and the other one that is in good shape is a great car in the world.
Who drives the Porsche
Only car that will beat that Porsche is a 918
In Germany we say: deutsche Ingenieurskunst
Carwow tip: just skip the first 4:15 min and you are good to go 👍
Ferrari! Ferrari! Ferrari!!!
Ferrari for the looks and the luxury driving... lambo for for the brute force approach.
“It will go viral if I die” omg 😱 Mat is a madman this is the best video I’ve seen you guys make.
That lambo is a very angry beast...
Mat and Yani remind me of myself and my best friend... seemingly the worst best friends ever 😂
The Porsche, my favorite car from day one.
Lmao Mat that was the best intro ever!
Because it has like high suspension but it’s also quick it means that it’s Smooth
The Ferrari 812 superfast is the one I would choose
Porsche 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪 🇩🇪
Porsche for me all the way ❣❣❣
Porsche
loudest is not the fastest
Ferrari
812 Superfast definitely
Murai. Whare are you
812superfast
lambo
when you say a lambo and a ferarri is the best and fastest car in the world:
4:43 Clearly the porsche, sounds just as great as our vacuum cleaner
Lambo sounds better all the way but that Porsche surprises the gut out of me.
I'd definitely take the Lambo
I would love the novitec Ferrari 812 superfast N Largo
Performance of Porsche in Ferrari body with sound of SVJ - that is perfect car...
Lamborghini looks best
imagine racing against a similar horsepower porsche like the GT2 RS :D:D:D:D
I love Ferrari 💯💥💨
Definitely the lambo
Simple  If I was spending my money - Porsche 911 turbo s If not - Ferrari 812
I'd have the 911 any day, no second thoughts whatsoever.
I love how Yianni jumped the first launch and STILL got beat by the Porsche with HALF the number of cylinders;  that's what I call real automotive engineering (unlike Bugatti).  It was also hilarious how he put his head forward like a sprinter...lol.  Great race.
I'll take the 911 Turbo S. That is one SWEET ride.. .v
Lamborghini is best ass
Porsche 4ever!
I have a friend with a Lamborghini, and I asked him if I can borrow his car to go to Burger King, and he said No.
I’d have the Porsche
what is up with these prosches
V12 lamborghini sound is amazing... porsche is fast but..the sound of v12 is more important
The ferrari is a beauty 😍
Lambo 4 ever 😍
Porsche ALL DAY. Keep in mind it's only a 6 CYLINDER
Porsche it's a sedan not a supercar🤣🚮
I came back to see yanni happy
Porsche all day every day.
That Porsche is just amazing.
Porsche, capish
Porsche for sure
I'd have the Porsche but Yiannis is so wrong, the Ferrari is by far the best looking.
Oh the Porsche for sure.
Well the Lamborghini has been the one  lowd car.
The Lambo jumped the light in the first race.
911 Carrera S 🙏🏽
# porshe forever
Obeosly Porsche,,❤️❤️❤️❤️
These cars are about more than a drag race
ferrari 812 superfast the name say everything bye bye lambo
Porsch 🤣
at 7:13 one  of the cars sound fucked
1st 812 Superfast. Close second would be A porsche though Idk about that one but Lambo..no
Wait a minute, let me get it straight......you are telling me a turbo s Porsche killed 2 'super cars'?
What about the Porsche gtr 3? It will be too much for those 3xotic cars huh?
Imagine paying $500,000+ to be gapped by a porsche.
Porsche is beautiful 🔥🔥🔥
porshe can win this two car in a quater mile but it cant beat it in longer race  did you guys notice ferrie was overtaking  porshe in rolling race
ferrari
Imagine owning a 12 cylinder exotic and getting smoked by a 6 cylinder
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Porsche is like that dude that doesn't talk much, but fucks everyone up when it comes to handling shit. My favorite for sure!
I am a 911 nut! But if I had to pick, I would have to pick the 🐎🐴
Soo daddys car just passed by kkkkkk
Let's talk about the Porsche not having to showboat warm it's tyres and still winning the race
amazing engineering from porsche
i would have the lambo in another color...
If such has 800 nm torque ,.... the svj win this because it's lighter then porsche
Turbo
Lovely Ferrari might as well have been designed by Michael Angelo, and does best what a grand tourer does best, fastest when it's going, and comfortable. Could be taken to local drag strip and also to civilised opera on weekends.
Aventador os the sexiest
Its not Porsch pronounce the e
The 911
The amount of power,  torque and engineering Porche team was able to put in that flat 6 is truly remarkable engineering.
Anything except the lambo
even in english, it’s Porscheeee, not Porsch, idiots
Love how yanny didn't even care about the 911 in the 2nd race😂
11:31 Definitely porsche 😊
this lambo have too much downforce
Ferrari sounds the best
That Porsche is so freaking good. Gees.
That Ferrari is absolutely stunning
That lambo is insanely loud but the Porsche is soo quiet  lol
Porsch is the best
"That moves like a 🐼" @Yianni, well said Sir!
i give the svj the sound test but you gotta agree with the superfast in the looks, its gorgeous
Porsche
"But we will crush them" @matwatson You made my day with that comment! ROFL
Porsche is like Khabib... Looks cute but dangerous
🤣🤣his accent
if that ferrari had 4wd it would of won
Umm yanni you know the Porsche also has a horse on its badge??
I would have the 911 turbo s
Imagine loosing in 360k car to 140k car
The Lamborghini says to the Ferrari : “I ain’t saying nothing if ya ain’t saying nothing.”
That Ferrari is SEXY!!!!!!
My favorite car . Lamborghini Aventador Super Veloce Jota .
Sound the best is Porsche 911                GT3 RS
Actually the horse beat the bull
911 Turbo S 💯
Lambo: Oh Porsche so cheap i will buy Two of Them...💷💷💷
Ferrari really So Heavy      ?!
*German engineering at its finest.*
Come on Man! You can buy 2 of those Porches in a single Lambos price...
SVJ For life mate
812 sf is beautiful
Porsche back is awesome
porsche has the best gearbox, minimum power loses, even mazda 787b use porsche gearbox
Ferrari sounds better honestly
VOTE LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR SVJ
I realize in the U.K. it's pounds not dollars, & football not soccer 🤬, but C'MON, IT'S TORQUE, NOT NEUTONS (or however the hell you spell it)!!! GIVE ME THAT MUCH!!! 😂
I’ll take the Porsche, all around beast
I would have the Lamborghini aventador svj
That Porsche is absurdly fast.
porshe sounds the best
Actually the fastest car in carwov, is an rs3 which did the drag race in 9.9 sec, and the secont fastest is the porche 911 turbo s, which did the drag race in 10.1 sec
the lambo sounded beter
The Porsche all day
The porche is like a bulet
Id take the 812 , install a proper exaust on it and then i can have the best sounding car ever ;)
There is a saying, empty pots make the loudest sound 😂😂😂. Good job Porsche
63!!! :D
Imagine the porsche with 800 hp
Nothing sounds as good as a win!
SVJ
Not for some reason Matt, I thought you would know why it is lighter after all the car review. Because the Lambo doesn't use dual clutch gearbox. Dual clutch is heavy after all its benefit of faster shift. The total downside.
The dummy in the Aventador had a false start in the first race. Cheating wanker.
Lamborghini svj
There's only one choice and that's the 911 what a 🚘
911... Rokie.   KNIGHTRIDER
Me in my $35k Subaru STI pushing 700 WHP being passed by these cars, Immediate smile on my face as I floor it  *LOL*
Porsche  looks  the best
That lambo looks really amazing honestly. But still would buy the Porsche over that
Ferrari for me :-)
Porsche 911 turbo s, but in red!!!!!!!
Ferrari
I would pick the Porsche
The Ferrari 100% won the sound test
Porsche the silent assasin............................. Porsche is best f##k the rest!!
I'd take the Porsche . Just all around beast. I'd love to put snow tires on and drive it around here drifting
how does even porsche win?! These german cars are a different breed man, it is half the price of lambo and beat it!
Porsche
Porcshe
Lamborghini svj
porsche because it’s a nice car but it’s not to out there. it’s sounds nice but not to loud and the performance is better than the ferrari and the lambo.
Lambo sound cool😍😍😍😙
I would have the lambo
I'd rather have the porsche:))
Remember: DO NOT MESS WITH ZE DEUTSCHE
Ferrari is a best.
That Porsche  by a mile, and it's the best looking car
I will take the Porsche with engine modifications.   Porsche the overall great car.
Ferrari the Best
Svj
This guy has the worst fake tan.
10:26  What a wooden head. He pushes the Ferrari leather door panel open with his foot.  That would kick his ass..!!
Just an 4 seater beating 2 supercars , always the Porsche
Lambo👍🏽
Lol, bunch of 12 year olds in the comment section. People who can afford these are not even racing they’re just driving it down the roads and making insanely beautiful noise (except Porsche). Plus Aventador and that Ferrari can take that Porsche down on a track any day.
the Porsche won because being turbo it has more NM and in the start it has a clear advantage, if the Porsche had been aspirated like the lambo and the Ferrari remained to grasp the daisies 😅
Good day, awesome video, and well done Porsche! Just a quick question please: At 10:30 in the video, you removed your GoPro from just behind the steering wheel. Could you please tell me what sort of mini flexible suction cup you were using to hold the GoPro during the test? Thanks a lot!
Never miss with the German 👌
911
Basically buy a porsche <3
Porsche or Ferrari lambo nah
I would get the Ferrari!!👍
I would still get the ferrari if money no object lol, there is just something special about that car, front mid engined, v12, na, just feels right
3:38 Sounds
Ma come cazzo parli?
That Porsche is insane. That thing goes.
John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son JESUS CHRIST FOR OUR SINS. so whoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life Amen Amen Amen Amen
I’d take the porsche
Porsche.
Lamborghini cheated off the line, first race
Porsche- wtf I'm here. disrespectful
Turbo S 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Porsche everyday
The vacuum cleaner sounds best
I would get the svj and sell it for both the super fast and porche =))
I would want to have Porsche 911 Turbo S rather than Lamborghini and Ferrari.
I would be like to have the Lamborghini 63
I want to have ferrari 812
lamborgini
Im really impressed with porshe winning :D
The German accent was horrible
As much as I love JDM over all others and I hate to admit it, Porsche is the king of stock factory combustion performance... in the world and of the world.
Porsche, cheaper and better
Lamborghini
The cars aren´t worth the money they cost.
the "vacuum cleaner" wins.....   again 🤣🤣🤣
Fackin porsche. The exhaust is sad though
Id have the Porche with a straight pipe exhaust and a red color.
812 : "im the fastest ferrari ever" Svj : " im the fastest car round the nurburgring" 911: "nice... OK BYEEEE"
The Porsche went like F*** off
Just Porsche.
ferrari looking way better
Lamdoujh
i will get lambo and sell it for 2 porches😂😂😂😂😂😂
Porsche is showing off... such an over performer.
Ferrari 👌🏽
Svj
I want the ferrari
Svj
the ferrari
But the sound of that svj oh my god
Ferrari 812
The porsche sound the best
Theirs a big reason why everyone at downtown Toronto financial district has a Porsche 912
Everything is better then a Lamborghini. Even a Prius. While it takes an nothing short of an idiot to launch an all-wheel drive it takes skill it launch anything rear-wheel drive. Noting is better then a ferrari.
lambo
Porcshe
Porsche all the way!!!!!
Ferrari 812 Superfast
(Trap music) Beat Matt... Let the Porsche go... (More Trap) Just beat Matt
Porsche playing with them Dang all that money only to get spank buy a hype up VW
yanni cheats and jumps the start in every race!
The only car for the man who doesn't have to be be flashy and in your face trying to brag about how amazing they, doesn't have that big huge engine that makes you go holy sh*t, or the massive price that makes you say the same thing but just continuously outperforms the others. Easy choice, the Porsche
The Lamborghini run the rev contest
Aventador SVJ 😂🤷‍♂️💕
Of course, the Porsche
7:53 Porsche is mother
Gimme the lambo, I’ll slap on a couple turbos and be doing 8s
porscha
Porsche with a replacement exhaust system.
Come on man... Italian people don’t speak as u...
The Ferrari is front engine and rear wheel drive of course it doesn’t have the traction of the lambo and Porsche
The guy in the ferrari is cool!
porsche is too strong, even the lambo already "surrender" by ONLY looks for ferrari during race. no compete.
Which car would I have  The porche is the cheapest of the 3 and the best performer but I'll still choose the Lamborghini SVJ
Porsche dusted other twos
Watching this made me a proud German
lambo ofcourse
Lamborghini Aventador svj
lamborghini was not in race mode, but in street mode
porshe is better loser lambogings
Only lambo svj
You gotta love the porsche
Ma l’italiano di Matt? ITALIANI FATEVI SENTIRE
911
Lambo anyday boy
To know that the Porsche can seat 2 more people and outrun the other two with 1/2 the cylinders is mind-blowing.
Porsche be like why am I even here..
That Porsche just wins left and right such a Beauty...
U-boat turbo s
If I could afford all tree but could only get one, I would go with Porsche. Because made in Germany
Ferrari
Rega ma mat che prova a fare l'italiano all' inizio
I would like the Porsche 911 turbo s it's my dream car silent but deadly
I like the way that specific ferrari looks the most however I would undoubtedly take a lamborghini hurracan over any other car besides maybe a mclaren 720s
Lamborghini was a tad bit better  a far as engine reving but man tbat ferrari was lovely
Do Lambo's still use slow single clutch gear boxes?
Lamborghini looks the nicest but to owned I would probably  take the Porsche.
911gt2...
Best Sound definetly the Ferrari. Own the Lambo.
Porsche is the the better one of the three
porsche every day!!!
If money was no object I’d have all 3 cars
Can we just clarify that an SVJ is actually £271,000 NOT £360,000
The porch is my dream car
Woah let's wait for the 992 gt2 rs its gonna smoke like .................... Everything ?
The Svj 😍😍
Imagine a Porsche 911 with 800HP and more NM :D  Ich liebe deutsche Ingenieurskunst :D
Less power, yet it wins. Amazing Porsche!
I think the Ferrari sounds better than the lambo
black ferrari is a killer, although lambo is ohhh my gawwd as well
Love the 812
812 superfast is way better looking ffs
1st race: 05:20 2nd race: 07:00 1st rolling race: 08:19 2nd rolling race: 09:29
I would take the Porsche 911 turbo S everytime, it's just an outstanding automobile.
Send me a Porsche mat.❤️❤️❤️ Love from india 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
porsche by a mile
ferrari 812
Ooohh mmmy ggod what the helll is Porsche doing😈😱👌. and  the Porsche be like. god y u put me into these puppys

7:34 😂😂😂
Porsche all the way!
I’d have the Porsche....
All that bluster from the V12's (as awesome as they sound) and still can't beat the Porsche 😂🤣
The Porsche sounded the best 😊
Lamboooooo
Imagine what Porsche could do with 800 HP
I thought i were in carwow-india channel lol at the beginning
Lamborghini adventador SVJ IS THE BEST AND MY DREAM CAR
The Porsche sounds fantastic when you are driving it because it is all about engine sound and not some high pressured exhaust sound.
911, of course.
Ferrari❤💙
812
Can we all agree Porsche engineers are probably the best car engineers in the world?
Bring a Bugatii for this Porsche ! =))))
Meanwhile.... Nissan GTr watching this
812sf: The rich kid  SVJ: The Jock kid 911: The quiet kid with the AR
Image u buy a 300k Lamborghini and get smoke by a porsche
Porsche sounds best 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
Aventador SVJ all the way... just for the sound, and those violent gear changes, its worth it <3
6:28 lol
Porsche
Porsche
I'll take the superfast despite the 911 being the overall better value
假的，600匹怎么可能赢？
Porsche is just the ultimate sports car can’t beat it overall!
Porsche...Yanni, there is NO SUBSTITUTE  lmao
Geilo! 🇩🇪
The Porsche
nato clarence
I'd take the Ferrari anyday
I knew that the Turbo S would win.
Ferrari
Ferrari: I am so fast, they call me Superfast. Lambo: I am so fast, I am a Lamborghini and I cost 360k... Porsche: Halt mal kurz mein Bier, Pappnase.
Porsche 911 turbo s
lamborghini won
5:25 Yanni’s launch face gets better every-time.
100% Ferarri
the porsche is silent but deadly
Yanni is so funny 😂
hhalsöasl
Nice wellcome to Thailand and my chanel.
F yessss lambo..
The Porsche is the best car for its price
Porsche is the best sound
SVJ
Porsche 911
PORSCHE 911 TURBO S...goes about its killer business in a very,very subtle and serial killer mode.♥️
the lambprghini wasnt designed for only frag racing, its main goal was to be the fastest car on the nurburgring, and it was succesful until amg gt black series came out and porsche came out with the gt2 rs, the amg is the fastest still. anyways tge lamborghini here in this video is faster than the other 2 on track
😮 I wasn't expecting that.... That's not even a top model Porsche is it???
Ferrari Lover ❤️❤️❤️
Superfast by far the best looking.
He probably died the moment he stopped recording
That Porsche is insane Ferrari and Lamborghini  are very loud
The Lambo sounded best.
Ferdinand and Ferry would be proud.
I would have the lambo then just sell it to buy the Porsche and spec it to how i want it
Porsche best
This race clearly says that the Porsche has the world's best auto Engineer
svj
Always
Porsche
Lamborghini
yyyyeeessssssssssssss....mamma mia 911.... partenza da fermo nn da tregua a nessuno....poco rumore e tanta carne al fuoco, e anche tanti freni....avanti cosi!!!!!!uhuh...
imagine if people saw carwow for the first time and this was their first video to watch they would think he was italian for the first 15 to 20 seconds.
Literally any other supercar, but the Porsche turbo s. 150k for boring.... yeah, not worth.
ferrari
How is that Porsche so damn fast
Lamborghini Aventador svj
Interesting how there's a huge amount of money in these cars and absolutely zero skill involved in the comparison. Fully automatic mode. The car shifts, electronic launch control takes care of everything off the line, traction control takes care of any problems or wheel spin down the track.  The driver holds the throttle to the floor with the other foot on the brake. At go, release brake and hold the wheel straight. Notice how they are looking around and talking from beginning to end. Because the drivers are doing just slightly more than nothing. Next will be the launch mode does everything by itself and it releases the brake when the system hears go. Or when the cars have more autonomous capability you just stand outside and watch, cheering your car on..  How about a head to head doing something that actually requires some driver skill. You could  turn off all the electronic aids and at least use the paddle shifters or Like lapping a road race coarse
the ferrari should b a n-largo
Porsche German Power 💪🏽
Svj forever ❤️
Pourche is fast than 3 cars
In the rolling race you can see, how bad the transmission in the lambo is. Because no double clutch...
The Ferraris are a little bit slower of the line than the lambos because they aren't 4WD like the lambos, they RWD... but ferraris are definitly faster in rolling races (pista>huracan) (superfast>aventador)
Porsche : keep warming ur tyres guys... I have no time... I am going... See ya
Yanny said the bull beats the horse but he forgot the Porsche is also a horse😂
me a boy and i have a rerrari 812 wit a v12 to it fast ta my house 1500hp i like it
The Porsche 911 is and remains the Porsche 911 ... the sports car of all sports cars❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍
Sport car : we need a v10 Porsche:proud of boxer engine
12:00 none are manual so none
Ferrari any day
Think I'd take the lambo just because of how it sounds
Porsche 911 Turbo seems very similar with the Nissan GTR having good launch control,  power and beating everyone lol.
Ferrariv812 and Porsche 911 Turbo💪.
Porsche all the way on looks!!!
Close races are the most satisfying.
Ferrari is love❤️
10:25 kicks door open on 400k ferrari
I would take the Ferrari for sure. But man, that Porsche is an engineering marvel!
Aventador svj
No one will know how I got over a thousand likes.
Porsche God
Nunca subestimes un porsche xDDDD
That italian accent intro🤣 pizza
the porshe is nice, simple and  fast
Lambo I’m sorry mat
12:04 Lamborghini but black
That Porsche is bloody insane
Your mate in the Lambo always jumps the start.
Porsche come on faster and stronger, has won a landslide victory 😍😍💪
Porsche 911 because it's just well rounded and genius
Can you please respect the rules and start racing without CHEATING starting earlier? Cmon guys, every time that spoil the experience, someone is cheating
Porche is the best ❤️❤️
Ferrrrrari
Porsche stuttgart
Kool kar man  I like the Farara but slow   Vote goes to the porch hands down
Ferrari sounded best
ferrarii 812 is the best car for me it is the most beautiful
lamboghini sound is the best
HAHAHAHA Mat is a legend
Ferrari
Lamborgini
Porsche. All-day, every day.
For an over half a million dollar car it really underperformed
Deutsche Ingenieuskunst
Ferrari🔥💪
Perfect showcase of what Ferrari and Lambo are actually about, STATUS. They have nothing to do with performance, merely status and maybe good looks (I dont like it though).
Ferrari p
Why the lambo is light Because the lambo is made of carbon fibre BTW
The Porsche sounded the best 😊
Thats why I own a Porsche. The King of racing.
Porsche
Lambo lindo!
Porsche 7 days of the week.. A car for grown up people.
I would like the lambo, so I could sell it buy two Porsche and enough fuel for a lifetime and beat everyone two times with two different cars
I would have the Porsche 911 turbo s
I love how both the Italians with v12  that also forget about their torque are battling and the Porsche with half the cylinders but is just cruising to a win
my mac reminds me of the lambo's rev
THAT PORSCHE WTFFFF **-**
I will have the ferrari 812 super fast it is my dream car I swear
Ferrari
And speed
The Porsche because it’s practically focused
The Porsche: I have acceleration The lambo: I have sound The Ferrari: I have speed
Lambo svj all day
so the Porsche is by far the best car  .German Engineering will always be the best.
7:00 - if you want to skip ahead straight to the race
Lambo und Ferrari kämpfen gegeneinander  Porsche: was macht ihr dahinten schon wieder
Porche 🔥🔥🔥🇩🇪
Nice porshe
Great job Germany!
The porsche sounds better 👍
When I was younger it would have been the Lambo for looks, also the sound is amazing. Must be more of a buzz to drive through tunnels etc. Now I’m older I actually prefer the simpler understated look of the Porsche. I’d even prefer the look of a 4s or standard carrera/Targa.  I’d obvs prefer the turbo to drive though
The sound of the aventador sounds sick it's loud
the Porsche is literally the definition of silent but deadly
I'd rather have the ferrari 812 superfast honestly it's rarer than the aventador svj
these results are not real, too many errors, one of the "pilots" always takes off first, the cars have not been set correctly, no sport mode, always in automatic mode, not very serious
Farrari
Lambo all the time...every where...
Ferrari it is!
Porshe
Turbo s
Porsche!  There's no substitute.
Please pronounce "Porsche" correctly. Even Clarkson gets it right and he hates the marque............ allegedly.
By the looks it's never gonna be the Porsche. Tough been Ferrari and lambo. But I'll go with the Lamborghini!!!
Ferrari: better sound Lambo: Louder sound Porsche: No sound
p
Ferrari: Italian  Lamborghini: Italian/German  Porsche: German
The porsche is basically the cameraman lol
Lamb. SVJ 63
porsche
I would have the Porsche 911 Turbo S. That’s the find of car I would keep forever, I would love to drive the other two for fun but not for keeps.
I'm gonna choose Lambo so I can sell it and get a Porsche and one 6 bedroom house in Albania
7:10 check this please 😂😂😂
911 Turbo! ;)
7.36 Yanni dipped for the line -looools 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lamborghini
HONESTLY..i would take the porsche its good for daily driving and a better mpg and a more better daily driver.....yeaaa definitely the porsche .
The Ferrari is extremely good looking
Ferrari
Porsche the underdog master and cheapest
Porsche go brrrrrrrrrrrr
Well after the race it's Porsche ❤️
The annoyed epoch seemingly remain because month predictably disapprove down a spiteful closet. energetic, pale weight
Wait for the 812 VS
Lamborghini is the best
Leamb
I love the Porsche....it's a stealth fighter!!
Sleeper Porsche?
Lambo's louder but this orginal Ferrari's sound is priceless
Why isn't there a Dodge Viper vs Porsche 911Turbo s
Porsche
Me when my teacher explains math and reading 5:05
do not forget, that Lamborghini is part of the Volkswagen Group since 1998. So there are 2 Germans, not one ;-)
For weekdays to the office the Porsche. For the weekend the Lambo
Porsche! Enjoyed the video.
Is yany like his boyfriend or something, that guy is sooo annoying!
Lamborghini
The porsche is that one quiet friend who shows up to play basketball and the wrecks the entire enemy team...then casually goes for lunch.
Two V12 legends vs a german sleeper vaccum cleaner 🤣
LAMBO
Porsche daily, no doubt
911 looks best
Come to think of it.. The Lambo AvantedorSVJ is just a name with no special thing to it. Smdh!!!
Lamborghini won
It’s the lambo from the rev battle
Lambo SVJ all the way
Porsche is the best you get luxury comfort and speed all all of those it's like the king 👑
Lambo
Course I would have the Ferrari ...
Definitely aventador svj
Lambo all day everyday
All these videos do is further reinforce my desire to buy a Porsche lol
Porsche!
Porsche always be a silent killer.
Das Porsche, Ja!
those accents were actually on point
Porsche
id have the porsche because its quieter and cheaper and i like the porsche looks
the lamborghini
Ferrari
Porsche, in the pursuit of perfection, has delivered with the 911 Tubo. A true daily driver production car that destroys the "super car" myth. Absolutely amazing and at half the price!
Ferrari's are THE MOST overrated crap!!
What a sick lineup. Tough to choose between either of those.
dat porsche must have 100+ hp than they say theyre dynos are broken in germany it cant be dat fast with only 600hp
Well, there’s the best advert for the 911 turbo S that Porsche never made or spent a penny on!!!
Even if the Porsche had 50% less horsepower I'd still choose it.
Porsche has best sound
enzo's gonna be so pissed about this.
SVJ
I'd have the turbo s even before watching it mince these V12s
Porsche definitely
I’d have the Ferrari
I'll take the Porsche 100%
Porsche for sure. All day, Everyday
The real race is between Lamborghini and Porche, Ferrari is just for a show! NO OFFENSE...
Don't Underestimate 812SF🔥😎❤️
Is it just me or does the 812 look like a supra?
Ferrari is best
James may: the porche just.... sodded off
The turbo s. Porsche is the pinnacle of automotive engineering.......
My dad has a porche
That new 911 is kinda pretty tho.
Based off of looks, I still have to give it to the Porsche. I'm not about all of those sharp edges that Lamborghinis have. The Ferrari is a close 2nd but is just a bit too flashy for my taste. I like factory sleepers and this 911 is just that. Yeah, most people who don't know about Porches are still going to realize it's faster the average sports car, but I feel like they don't actually know just by how much.
Porsche. Cause German power
It aint a fron porch, it's a Porsha!!
Yianni was so much more happy and cheery in these older videos. Nowadays he's very 😬😐
Porsche
6:51 finally!!!!!!! we get footage of the starter! At last we can put a face (and body) to the voice :)
Lambo all day every day
I think lambo doesn’t value 360k…
Porsche 🔥🔥🔥❤️
Lambo
anyone of them will do. I'm not picky
First time I've seen a race to see who wins second place lol 😆
Ferrari sounds best
Imagine mocking 6 cylinders for all your life then having your V12 smoked by one
Goodbye Aventador we will miss you 😭😭😭😭
PORSCHE all day!
Did.. did i watch a Porsche beating a lamborghini Svj and a superfast ferrari?? Im stoned!
Lamborghini jumped the start in race 1
Ferrari
Next up:  911 turbo s vs Saturn V rocket.
Ferrari all day
Porsche🖖🖖🖖🖖
Why is that flat 6 so fast?
Ferrror
LAMBO GOO
nine one one
ferrari looks the best and sounds the best. Lambo looks and sounds like a toy
777 horse powah 😂
I would have a porche
It’s mad tho that Porsche sounds cheap and tbf it looks cheap in that Silver paint yet it beat a hypercar that costs more than twice as much! I’d have rather seen Shmee in his McLaren Senna take on Mat and Yianni here
Porsche deklassiert alles.Das ist perfekte deutsche Ingenieurskunst.  Der macht sie auch auf der Rennstrecke nass.
LFA Please!
That Yanni bloke makes me laugh so much.... what a character..... first class..... he loves it
Ferrari only TIFOSSI For life
If you are buying , Porsche for sure .  😂😂
That Porsche is no joke
I'd get the SVJ so I could sell it and get an LFA, which is cooler than all 3 of those and sounds way better
The ultimate trio of manufacturers
Sound for lambo Drag and brakes, price too porsche Rolling races ferrari
Mat watson the MIMICRY artist
Porsche 911 turbo s is the best looking one hands down
I would have the lambo over al of them
Which car do you rather to buy? Me: Porsche, then Ferrari
Porsche the best !!!❤❤
I love Porshe. It's silent killer machine
porsche of course
I’d have a Ferrari
Ferrari
PORSCHE YES.
Lamborghini
Sv
These tests are bollocks..... each driver has compelling different abilities and more importantly, reaction times. The only fair result is to swap each driver for each car in each test.
Lambo is definitely the most fun.
Lambo
7:34 yianni gave 90 hp more to the lambo
God knows how I love the porsche
Porsche quietly going about its business leaving the only drag race actually happening is between the SVJ and 812 🤣🤣🤣
Why do the modern porsche have such awful exhausts tho. Yes regulations but look at this vid both ferrari and lambo had great sounds with their revs
There is only one car, Porsche. the other two are not cars!
Some
This is the only time we see the countdown lady upclose
Porsche is glamorous lambo is stunning but in straight line on longer track Ferrari would mail it all day long
Where to get that yannimize cap
Porsche Fuckin Kills Everysuper car whether its ferrari or Ghini. Germans Really Very Fast
Ferrari Italian junk
Porsche
I’ll choose the Ferrari Matt
surely Porsche, besides looks better than ferrari and lambo
ferrari
The accents were great, especially the German one.
porsche lmao
That Porsche is 10's car right out of the factory 🔥
3.8 flat six running like that against 6.5 v12’s is just nuts.
If only there was a car with the consistency of porche  looks of Ferrari and sound of lambo
Rolling start was won by Ferrari by a wide margin, which is the most likely scenario if you were to be confronted by a turbo S.
ferrari
Very well accent in Italian
Such a shame... Porsche has just slap the Italians. Porsche Turbo S always and forever!!! 😃
Porsche 911 Turbo S aus Deutschland!
Porsche Turbo S... Ultimate Sleeper 😴👹
2,2 bar on a Ferrari. Looks very low to me mate.
É turbo né pai
let’s be honest, even though we all want math to win, it’s just too funny to see yanni winning.
it's insane the the lambo and ferrari are fighting to get second place behind a Porsche which is classed as a sports car.
Lambo sucks so much
Porsche might sound quieter, but It is clearly the fastest supercar on track puting shame on both Lambo and Ferrari
Yani's like Trump. Even when he loses he still thinks he won !!!
Ferrari
Bring the porshe spyder 911
What’s impressive is that cars these days can be casually driven to 190mph over and over again while playing around. 20-30 years it was a challenge to not die or wreck the car while going those speeds.
Porsche
When Porsche is underestimated and then everyone thinks it’s not a good car.   Porsche: HOLD MY BEER
Lambo
Lamborghini SVJ.!!!
siempre se rien de porsche. es el que menos suena pero es el mas rapido ajajajaj. en cuanto al lambo, perro que ladra no muerde.
German over italian any day
Is this a Porsche sales advert ?
Porsche... german perfection
Porche turbo S is like the quiet kid in the class who is actually brilliant but doesnt brag alot
ill have the porsche
'Doesnt look as good?' Nothing can look as good as that porsche. Seriously. And then audi r8. Lambo and ferrari does not even come close
pooop fock youuu KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK BRAZILLLL!!!!!!!
id take the ferrari
Porsche, every day in every way!!!
I can’t believe my eyes that Porsche is crazy
I love the Porsche
How they get a dream job as such, someone in Oregon or America let me know if we can get a gig like this lol..
The Porsche is a Legend
Ferrari looks better
You can't beat a Ferrari 812 better try a good driver and see the result
911 Turbo S all day!
I'd take car number 4, the McLaren 765LT
DO FERRARI 812 VS DEMON PLS
Lamborghini all the way
A 911 turbo s with stage 2 and 800 hp might be the fastest car on earth 🤯😳
porsche 911 turbo s⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡💥💥💥
Can i get 488 pista instead ?
Frari: Wo wo wo wo wo Lambergini: wogu woo goo Porshey:cccccccccccc🤫 and then frari and lambergini: WTF where is porshay dud 🤣🤣
Porsche wins it
Race starts at 5:21
The accents 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Someone tel me from where the 800nm of the Porsche come from???
I love that Porsche. Porsche for me.
5:20 - You're welcome.
Frrari
The Lamborghini sounded the best
Ferrari sound the best
The. Ferrari
Porshe is a sleeper
812 superfast
Svj
Ferrari
Too funny ahahahahah
Lamborghini huracan perfemante
812  AND  SVJ
porsche turbo s is a choice for me, and yes i prefer it's look than the other 2
Lamborghini
Who cares about a Porsche ore Lamborghini... Ferrari is beautifull standing and driving, pure art.
the ferrari every day in the week, it has a soul compared to the porsche and not as wanna be as the lamborghini
race start at 5:20
Svj baby all day every day......
Your accents...🤯
I thought Porsches launch best but after  watching this ,you can surely say that a dct would have made  Aventador the fastest on this channel
Porsche everyday.
The cut asia pragmatically cycle because ton regularly owe onto a teeny health. sore, obscene texture
I’d still choose Porsche
Ofc porshe
I would have to lamb it is cool
Porsche
Lamborghini SVJ
Ferrari is the icon of the super car the design the feel inside it is deferent i love it
Porsche destroy's the poser's :)
If i would choose i will definitely pick the Porsche no doubt! 🔥
I think that SVJ weight number is really low.  Several reviews show it as closer to 1770 kg.
Porsche flat six 3.8 turbo engine is a masterpiece. Unbelievable torque with 650 HP.  Beats 8 and 12 cyl cars. Loud isn't necessarily the best.
Ferrari all the way
Remind you the fact Porsche calls this a “sports car” 😳
Svj
Lamborghini
ferrari sound better than lambo
Lambo Jumped on the first race.  Killed the Ferrari though.. LOL yeah you have .5 seconds on him...   Second race.. just a little different when you start well and not jumping the start.
Porsche Turbo S..  and its cheaper.
Ferrari looks faaaaaaaar better 💆
Lambo
Ferrari For life
I love cars I probably know 95.5% names of cars
Lambo is the best
Porsche says “Italians forget about torque”. We show you why this big mistake
I should want ferrari
Porsche is the best.
just to let everybody know... we don't speak like super mario
The accents were awesome
The crowded wealth directly suck because name astonishingly list failing a woebegone liver. spiffy, hypnotic giant
Porsche Porsche all the way, I was will always be a big Porsche fan all the way, from a small boy, wish I could have that beast!
Porsche and Ferrari looks very good ..
Lambo abd Ferrari best Sound.. porsche best car for the monay
Functional athlete VS bodybuilding
SV J
Drag - Porsche  Comfort run - Porsche  Sport run - Ferrari Brake test - Porsche  Poor, sorry expensive Lambo
ferrari
0.44 not a supercar per se Matt, it's a grand tourer. And it is and does best what a GT is supposed to do and be. Comfortable, fastest when it's running (won so easily in the rolling race) and comfortable, not to looking look so awesome as if crafted by Michael Angelo!
ferrari
Loooovve the Porsche, but we all want the Lambo for sheer flamboyance! Just not the running, buying or owning costs! 😊
The Porsche reminds me the scene from the movie Indiana Jones The Raiders of the lost Arc when Dr. Jones shot with his gun the swordsman who was brandishing his weapon preparing for an epic duel
Germans are step ahead
Porsche ❤️❤️❤️
Porsche has amazing engineering, from race tracks to Paris to Dakar, they have been at this game for a long time  It's the lamborghini for me though, just the roughness of the engine sound gets me every time  If you really wanted to be the quickest, you'd go for a Tesla or the Porsche but if you wanted to turn heads driving around the place, it's the lamborghini for me
Porsche in black best built car
Ferrari! Because of its shape! :P
Ferrari
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Porche how amazing!
https://youtu.be/T_xSURp4-pY
I would take the 812 . Cant imagine a supercar being so quiet like the 911 . The lambo is crazy but too cocky for me
Turbo S before I watch it.
Porsche is so fast .. And so boring at the same time 🙄
we all know Lambo is all about the looks....but the engine is sucks.....just to be honest....
The Grey thing in distant
Ferrari 812
Ferari is the best looking car but I like porshe.
Lambo Aventador..Looks BadAss.. 👍🏻
Porsche, it is good for every day use and is more practical than the other two, it also has 4 seats.
The Ferrari Looks And Sounds The Best!
the Porsche every day
Porsche: the smart kid who dosen't seem cool  lambo and ferrari: Cool Kids   Exam marks: porche 100% lambo and ferrari fails 🤣
ITALI GTO!!!!!
lamborghini svj
I'd love the Lambo Aventador SVJ (roadster)!
Ferrari is the best
My fav is probably the porsche - just so well engineered and with an exhaust, damn. itll rip
The FERRARI for me deffs the lamborghini is too much of a race look but don't have the speed to match
Porsche is my vote
Yanni is thee most aggressive drag racer ive ever seen, its like he wants to murder someone. LMAO. his all smiles and before race then turns murderer.
ferari is the nicest
Lambo is the beast god sound in the universe
This has to be the best sounding drag race you guys have ever done
The Lamborghini
Remember guys the turbo S will alway poop poop on you
Porsche sempre n 1
Lamborghini  better
I like the aventador svj sound great but the one is really quit I dislike that one I like Farrar well whatever
Porsche the best! Italians for boys)))
Mat and Yiani makes the best 😂💥
Come onnnnnn 😂😂😂😂 yianni your face is priceless
aventador sounds best
Yanni is a real a-hole burning out that SVJ like that!  Aren't you not supposed to donut an AWD car like that?!  What a moron!
I hadn't seen yanny happy in a while
I'd have the ferrari or the porche, the aventador looks ugly in this
Wouldn't say cheap ide say cheaper
Porsche for me, I just like fast and understated. Just like in the movie, Risky Business, Porsche, there is no substitute.
I’d have the SJV. The 812 etc all sound awful and like a tin can
Review the svj pleasee
911 turbo S Baby
Ferrari
Porsche… there is no substitute!!
Porsche is the BLACK HORSE here 😳..LOL
That Lamborghini aventador svj is crazy loud
Don't forget that the porsche has a turbo and is awd. The lambo is awd and naturally aspirated and the ferrari is rwd and naturally aspirated so they have a "handicap".
Ferrari
I had no interest in any porsche until i started watching these drag races.. either that or im getting old
Der panzer!!! The most engineer in the world
Since Lamborhini is owned by a German brand, the Lambo is basically also a German car.. produced in Italy.
10:37 thank god for brakes brakes brakes! There was only a mile of runway left...close call!
The Turbo is the greatest!!
It sure must be emabarrassing for Lamborghini and Ferrari to see Porsche beat them all them time, and in a car that's so much cheaper too.
Lambo was best sound
I was with the Porsche the whole way through
Ferrari
812
Mat should be the next host of Top Gear
That porche  is insane, how quick is that.
porche"s  power💕
Porche for sure
Daily - Porsche. Just as fast and powerful & practical.  Looks & for proper sports - Lamborghini. Sorry Matt 😂😂. I'm with Yanni on this one over the Ferrari.
Porche finds a way
This guy in red needs to quit talking so much and work on getting better at launching his Ferrari.
Lambo
Mobar or no car except porsche
Turbo s is stop light warrior
I WOULD HAVE THE 911 TURBO.
I think the Ferrari looks far better than the Lambo personally.
Frrdddfffrrewwawd🚘🚃🚘🚃🚃🚃🚃🚃🚘🚘🚘🚃🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘
Superfast or porsche, even tho i was aventador fan when it came out, i still love it tho
911 Turbo S is my favorite.
911...dah...
Lamborghini
Ferrari: barking dog never bite               Only sound but lack of performance  Porche : silent killer😏
Ferari
Lamborghini ❤️
Ferrari
911 masterpiece
In soundcheck the best is Lambo. But in other categories Porsche 911
I'm pretty much sure about the porsche 911 turbo S sales hiked up after it destroyed every car stood up against it. Amazing drag race.
100% Would be getting the SVJ
Anyone noticed the Porsche that they underestimated 😐😂
911 turbo S the better for this price
If I were paying for it, I would buy the Porsche no doubt. Then again, I'm a Porsche fan. Between the other two, I'd be all over the 812. It will have better resale. I love Lambos for the sound, but they don't hold their value like the Ferraris do. Honestly, I'd take any of them.
Porsche sounded the best
Whenever i see yanni, i just automatically smash the like button❤️
Not fair!!!!!!!!   The Ferrari 812 is a GT car.  Put a Pista up there and see the results then!!
Matt is one of the reasons I love carwow. He's so much fun to watch 😂
Porsche all day all night what the f*** ❤❤
who would win the nurburgring king or some little i6
5:27        Yanni’s face 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Porsche
812: best looking svj: best sounding 911: fastest
we needs bugatti divo , hey people like this comment plz zzz ... bugatti bugatti we needs this car .... like like like
where are is bugatti ? why not bugatti ? ☝🏾🥱😬😬
vw companies ❤
I loved this video but still waiting for the drag race where yianni doesn't jump the start😂
The 8 speed transmission is the difference maker.
Porchse
Porsche Turbo S all the way!
That's it am not getting a Lamborghini
5:26 I can only imagine the starter's ear damage.
Yianni moves before she lowers her hands
FERRARI
I would love to have a Ferrari
Porsche... all day everyday
I would get the SVJ and sell it for 2 Ferraris :)
if there was a Porsche 911 in a Ferrari 812 body, that would be my dream car
7:33 Yanni kills me 😂
That must be fun
Lambo
The rev limiter is the worst! It is the reason why the Porsche can’t rev over 4000 rpm and also the reason why it sounds so terrible.
I do like wow car but  you take   to long to get in to the race over 4 mins and still waiting for the race 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
lambo gang
911 all day long.
Umm yanni the Porsche has a horse on its badge so a horse did beat the bull
Omg  porshe beats lambo.. huh ....🤯😳😳😳
Lambo
6:21 lambo clearly cheated
In the first drag race the Lamborghini driver took off early. Why is the Porsche faster?
Matt jumped the start
Porsche feet up cigar in mouth “6 Will b enuff”  👊 🚙 💨 💨 💨
that Porsche though
Ferrari man the coolest looking car in here.
812 The best.
(Weak lions are the most roaring, and the fiercest are the ones that does not roar) this is an Arabic poet that describes the Porsche 911 turbo S 😎
Italiens just show😂 the real deal is the porsche
Pls pls keep doing accents. Ps. That Porsche though
SVJ
Aventador SVJ , Is just my type
Svj : Best looking 812 superfast : Best sounding Porsche: Best drag racing Hotel : TRIVAGO
RIP PORSCHE SOUND
I have more than 20 lambo... in forza horizon 4
SVJ IS THE SEXIEST CAR EVER MADE BY HUMAN BEING
Yano said the f word
wich car will i chose the porshe
Hahaha!! Aventator = is a Tractor! 812 Superfast (lol) = a FIAT With the Porsche you can drive every day to your Work and after that on the racing track!
NICE CARS
812 wins with a real driver
Porsche is better and it looks amazing 🤩
First time his friend let anyone drive his Lambo, proceeds to ring it's neck.
lambo
Here you go 5:20
Ferrari 812 for sure!!!  Wish it were AWD, if it were with that kind of power........WOW!!!!!
Bro The lambo driver cheated in the first race lmao. He went way before she signaled too.
I’d take the 812 hands down get and exhaust and tune make it scream louder than any lambo
That moved like a panda. Yanni definitely is a cheaky bugger 😂😂😂❤️
It is the best
do ferrari 458 lamboghini hurcan maclaran 570s race
I got Porsche 911. German cars are always best.
The mat's german talking at the start of the video got me😂😍
Everyone is a gangsta until buggati arrives
Porche: too much flexing come on let's go the race weaklings😂
make another video where you have the
Thats why like prosche thier small and few complications but the best and fastest
porsche every day
Porsche
Half the cylinders half the price. Nevermind everyday drivability, comfort and maintenance.  I'd be embarrassed if I owned a Lambo or Ferrari
I would go for the Porsche
812 super fast novitec
Lamborghini!!😆😆
Superfast vs mclaren 720s
Lambo svj
This is a contest between 2nd & 3rd place. The Porsche is the better car and at about half the price. Great test. 👍👍
Italian horsepower...
I'd buy the Porsche and make it faster
Omg mat's German accent😂
FERARIE
The situation change with a Ferrari F8 Tributo, because Is more light that Ferrari  812 Superfast. I think that this competition isn`t good. Ferrari F8 Tributo would has won on Porsche and Lamborghini 😏😏😏
I would like to have the lambo. But I don't think I'll ever in my life even will have the chance to drive one.
Porsche : Barking cars seldom wins the race😂
Ahh, German Quality, never disappoints.....
Id hav the lamborghini aventador svj its sounds like a raging bull
Ferrari
Deutschland, Deutschland über alles
Lamborghini
Off course Lamborghini Mat
Lamborghini aventador SVJ
Tell me Jenni GSV Aventador
And that isnt even the fastest/quickest Porsche
I would choose the Porsche if I could only choose one
I love how into it Yianni gets 😂😂
PORSCHE 🔥🔥
"...oh, it's just a little 6 cylinder.  Nothing fancy."
Yianni jumped another start.
Porsche all day long
911🇩🇪💪🏼
SVJ baby
The SVJ is so loud my ears blooding from them 🩸
Porsche 911 is better than other than two
Whaaaaaat the fuuuuuuuuse!!!!!  Porsche is not really normal man!!!!!!!  🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
the lambo or the ferrary
Im classique man i love thé Ferrari
Ferari is the best sound
But can we just take a second to appreciate the amazing stereotypical accents Mat did
Porsche destroyed in seconds 🔥🔥🔥
ستة سلندر من بورش يحرج سيارات 12 سلندر
Porsche is turbocharged  It was always going to win Ferrari and lambo make more power but it is at a very high RPM.
Porsche definitely has the best sound
Porsche is the best
Turbo s vs c8 corvette. Lets do this!
Every comment I read here is bout the Porsche 👑
Lamborghini Aventador svj so fa fast
Porsche made its cars in some sort of way that every single part of them  are in completly harmony and make the whole thing much much more than the sum of its parts
Ferrair
Frrea
I wish I have a 812 superfast
That porsche's performance is amazing, however, I'm not going to be drag racing but only cruising the drag if I owned one of these.  Therefore, I would have to take the super sexy superfast!  Sorry, Lamborghini, but I've never found wedges attractive.
I would pick the SVJ
The Lamborghini is best.
Svg
Lambo
Matt should have bounced the ferrari off the rev limiter when doing the sound check like yanni did with the lambo.
Best vids on YouTube
Porsche just is amazing full stop. You can’t beat it. 😻
911 is my choice
Porsche  winning
Two porsche's vs. the price of one lambo..  thats what i want and the best looking of the 3...
Just imagine a German man saying: You don't need 12 cylinders to win...
LMAO your German impression was spot on !!
Ferrari💕
Ferararu
Lambo aventador svj is the best
Made in Germany  Porsche rules.
Porsche for sure. Lambo is just show off like it's driver 😃
Svj
I would have a Ferrari
Ferrari it is the best car
Lamborghini aventador SVJ 63 I like it
Lamborghini but just for the sound other i would go for the farrari
Mat sometime u looks like matthew mcconaughey😂
that porch is fast
Lamborghini is best.
Porsche be like....ya I do it daily😎
I would have the porsche. If i had so much money.lol
If i could have i will have tha Lamborghini Aventador svj
the lambo cheated the first race.
Porsche!
by looks, the Ferrari... but the Porsche is just brutal.
Porsche all the way.
Turbo S !!!
Anyone that doesn’t say the 812 is mad
It's fucking difficult to beat German mad engineering.... Only Japanese can it on... With their GTR...👌👌👌
Ferrari looks the best lambo looks like a spaceship
Porsche Looks thousand times better then this rubbish lambo and Ferrari
Was gonna say your first launch was abit slow, but not much unit between Ferrari and lambo. Porsche all the way for me
Ferrari 812 Superfast
Lambs just don’t  sound nice they just scream and the Ferrari is a proper v12 sound
The lambo because i can sell it and buy the porsche and have some money left
Ferrari is the best looking 100%
Ferraris and Lambos are for people that like to be seen driving cars, Porches are for people that like to drive cars.
aventador svj
Lambo
Lamborgini
The only race in the world where guys r exited for losing.....!!!! Porsche : The f*** r they excited abt, I won.....!!!!
Lamborghini svj
Never do another video that's not in a German accent.
haha what a useless pieces of junk these cars xdd
I would actually rather have a Ferrari
Heeeyyyyyy! Perfect...was such a beautiful imitation...  :) :) :)
The adventador svj is always the best, no challenge is here for the svj😁
Porsche
Lamborghini sounds the best
Porsche definitely. The sound is simply changed.
I want that 812
Lambhogini
Matt jumped the fuck of the line there!!! 7:50
Ferrari 'not so' Superfast 😂
Well the Lambo cheated on the first drag race so the second go is valid 👍🏼
911💥
Mess with porsche,  get the hp
Porsche is technically the quiet kid, everyone thinks wrong about em until porsche shows its true potencial, thats why my dream car is the gt3 rs or the taycan turbo s, also porsche taycans are electric... HOW TF DO THEY HAVE TURBOS😂😂😂
Ferari
Put aside those cars, let's appreciate how well is mat changing accents between Italian and German, I literally can't stop replay it 😂
812 ❤️❤️❤️
Porsche is deadly
The Porsche is the beat sounding
Das krasse ist einfach.......Porsche zersägt mit dem Turbo S heute die Teslas. Die Autos sind die ultimativen Beschleunigungsmonster.
1. Porsche, cause German Engineering. 2. Ferrari, cause beautiful Italian symphony. 3. Lambo, cause it’s just ... ehhh
Porsche
I like Ferrari and Lambos, but THESE models look very vulgar to me. The Porsche is - in this group - all about style. The other two look like a real Ludenkarre (pimp's cart).
Yanni went on 2! Cheating bugger.
The super sad is 2   v12 cars can't beat the flat 6 Porsche 😂😂
Ferrari all the way
Porsche carrena 911 turbo pwer🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙
812 best sound
Lamborghini svj
Damn that svj launch is so aggressive
Ferrari
Τhere is no way that Porsche makes only 650 horsepower.... Irl it outputs at least 700 horsepower. Thus 10.1 seconds at the 1/4 mile...
Always The Legendo Ferrari
Common!!! With intense stare!!
the ferrari is 🔥 🤩😍
Svj
Porsche 911 Turbo S is the Best car ever
Porsche is faster, but who cares?
p
Ferrari has the best design
Drag race Aventador svj vs Koeningseg agera r 🙏🙏🙏🙏
No one can match the rocket start of an 911
I would probably have the Porsche because I absolutely love the new turbo S or the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ (I don’t really like the Ferrari)
Just Ferrari
I have exactly the same Ferrari with the same color
Definitley the porscrhe 💪🏽
Lambo’s one clutch gear box is way slow in shifting
Ooh ferari sounds the best high tone
Ferrari 🟩⬜🟥
I would have the Porsche because it has the best performance and it costs the least so I can do a lot of things with it like changing the exost which doesn't sound good at all .
That porsche really fucks with those supercars😂😂
Does Yianni ever NOT leave too soon?
Farrari
The Porsche is the best "real world " car of the trio .thought it would have won more easily ....now if we could just afford one ......nam jamaica
Id have the lambo... but yeah the boxer is better
Just before you go hit the bellend icon
Makes me love the Porsche even more. I'd choose the Porsche over these two
Amazing how this Porsche is sooo superior to these two spaghetti wheels.
Porsche there is no substitute
The porsche walks the walk
Less in everything and still embarrassing both of these trashy cars 🤦‍♂️
911 rules
Dude never race porche
Ferrari 812 sound better
that intro lol
Porsche still make the best sport cars. Final
Lambo- need warm tyres Ferrari- also need warm tyres Porsche- you bunch of losers
I like how the drag race is between the lambo and ferrari while the porsche is casually cruising
I love the lambo is  loud and good the ferri panda one is so bad is like so slow like a snail
812
Ferrai
The lambo so I could sell it and get the Porsche and a house! 🤣
Svj 😎
812
Porsche
Z
Everyone is chosing the turbo s
Lambi sounds great
Can this drag race can also be called as a..... front engine vs mid engine vs rear engine super car race... 🤔🤔😅
Team Ferrari wins the sound test
I don’t like the Porsche
Porsche is the best. black Ferrari looks the best of these three.
2 boys busy playing about in their loud ass toys whilst the gentleman finishes the job quietly without any fuss.
Captain joke shop teeth loses yet again
It hurts how much Lambos gearbox is baaaaaaad, baaaad for decades back....omg, just put the fucking DSG8 into it and let the bull fly!
Someone needs to fit an Akropovic exhaust system to a turbo s lol
I would choose the ferrari but in a diffrent colour
Turbo S for me thank you
812 everyday, twice on Sunday 😊
the first drag race the guy in the lambo jump start by miles.
I would love a Porsche😊
Ferrari booooooooyyyyyy
I really love Porsche
Ferrari
Lambo thats is a COOL car
keep it up
That Porsche is 1640 kg and has 650 hp. Lamborghini is 1525 kg and 770 hp. Both all wheel drive. How the heck ist Porsche quicker?? I'm not frustrated, but I just don't understand.
porsche is best ,,,
Dont say porsch pls its soo annoying. Its porsche with an e at the end
812
911 Turbo S  duuh
The two Italians have 12 cylinder engines, but the Porsche have a 6 cylinder but the two turbos are like times two for that engine so it performs similar to the Italians
My dad built his own 3 porsches
I own a 911, and wouldn’t trade it for either of those other two, “Porsche there is no substitute “
Lambo has the sound, Porshe has the best drag time, Ferrari has the acceleration.
Lamborghini
Ferrari
Ferrari so fast
Lamborghini is just heaps better sounding. It’s one of my favorite cars ever
I think the Fezza sounds best! Epic!
Say it with me, everybody, "Porsh-ah."
Definitely the Porsche 911 Turbo S
Turbo S looks soooo much better than the lambo. The lambo looks like trash
This Is German Engineering 🇩🇪 !
Joey: Heyy!! It's porshaww.
It defeats the point of having the expensive supercars if they can't even beat an everyday use car(Porsche) in a drag race.
Ferrari, what else ?
Fer
i would vote for the farrari 812 cuz amma BIG BIG fan of farrari
Ferrari all day
Ferrari sounds better to my taste of sound
Damn, the accents were spot on, Matt can definitely be good at stand up comedy
I wish they would include a half mile standing start in addition to the 1/4 mile
I would choose the Ferrari in Pearl White every day .. Danny 😉🌈
Is it just me but I find Lamborghinis a bit too busy. I like Ferrari better since it has a much cleaner design.
Ferrari and Porsche
Porsche never disappoints ,  always kicking everyone’s ass both on the track and in the streets
Bugatti Veyron vs Aventador svj
Aventador svj is soooo dam fast
Porshe is the best
Come on
I like how they’re admitting that they dont have a shot with the Porsche
Who is even driving the porsche?
911 over anything any day. Pure value for money putting those cars with double or more than its price to shame!
More money => less speed => lamborghini
Porsche 911 ❤❤🇨🇿
the lambo looks good but the Ferrari oohhhh its sweet
Lambo
That ferrari is a beast god
Porsche all day 😎
But Porsche wins everything
The horse always beats the bull
Those new 911's are ruthless. Top car
Basically three Volkswagen
Porsche said...ssshh and still won
That’s what I call German engineering
Lembo sound is bast ever sports car 👍
Porsche
If i could afford it, I'd take the lambo all day.  Is it practical,  not really but it is for sure more special.
That Porsche is absolutely insane
Ferrari
The porsche is like me. All cool and calm and when I lose my shit I go mental. So that will be the one for me
I have a feeling the 911 wasn’t in Sport+ on the last rolling race cuz there is no way an SVJ can get off first and then keep pulling ahead
Tough choice, which one to get. Maybe the one that costs 100K less than the Ferrari, while also being faster under almost any circumstance than both the italians, also while having 4 wheel drive, 4 seats, luggage capacity, reliability, is usable as a daily driver. It is just an added bonus that while driving the Porsche you would not look like a football player or a billionaire's spoiled kid as opposed to that lambo.
It's so funny that they don't even mind the Porsche as it systematically kicks their butt! XD
Lamborghini
Usually, the car that is last is ignored. Usually.
wow porsche is the cheapest and best,wow svj absolutely not worth
Ferrari
PORSCHE CAMERAS SHOULD ONLY FACE BACKWARDS
Ferrari but 458
Ferrari but 458
Porsche is lying about having 650 hp
Maaaan that Ferrari goes... it fucking scary goes
Ferrari
Why are we not doing honk tests?
The lambo is by far the best looking car..
Lambo gonna win
This just goes to show how German often outdone pretty much everybody else. the 911 is just the best car of all time!
200 kg more & rear wheel drive only and still manages to smash an AWD in 1/4 by losing with few centimeters and dominanting in every rolling race, Forza Ferrari!
Guys...we need a drag race between Chiron vs rimac concept one... And rimac concept one vs Hoonicorn 😣😣😣😣
Porsche. But not this one. I'd rather have a 997 GT2. 530 hp, just over 1,400kg, RWD and it came with a manual.
Bear Gears
The moral is: If you're hesitating between buying a Ferrari and a Lambo, buy a Porsche. And when you lose that race on the Autobahn against a Lambo or a Ferrari, Get an exhaust and a tune. Boom.
i would definitly take the lambo
porsche
I would go 812 even though I’m a Lambo guy..
The Ferrari
Porsche is a silent killer😎
porsche
Best sounding car was the Lambo....now best sounding vacuum cleaner gos to the porsche :P
That Porsche smallest engine of the 3 and cost the least ... but gaaaaahhhhdddaaaammmn that Porsche can go!  If I had to pick one I'd definitely get the Porsche!  Probably the most comfortable out of the three
2 horses destoy a bull XD
lambo lambo
No matter which car wins the race, no matter what the specs are, no matter how fast the car is,a Lambo is a Lambo!!!
Lambo all day everyday everyweek
Farrari
lamborghini
911♥️
i would have the ferrari if I could
Porsche is ugly
I like the Ferrari sound
Hi car wow
Porsche by a mile my favourite
Porsche silent but violent
Porsche 911 turbo s is a rocket 🚀
Lamborghini wins all the time
5:05 the car and mats face tho
I love  Farrari
Porsche are like my farts.  Silent but deadly.
Still I think svj is faster if you now how to drive it right svj my choice
Porsche
LAMBOO
Porsche
just a humble Porsche there
Porsche
Porsche
Don't know man, that Porsche is hard to resist. Maybe with a better exhaust system, but still I love that Porsche.
I would have               All of them
spoiler: non parliamo così
Pors best italia car its 🙄👎👎👎🤏
Did you guys hear Yianni making that sound at 7:35 lmao 😂
Watch out for the quiet ones
Nice start....😂😂😂😂😂😂
My favorite car is a Ferarri laFerarri
Ferrari
I like Ferrari sound
only 150k . Okay it’s cheap ....
Porche should sponsor carwow. That amount lf fanbase made by carwow for porch 911 turbo s is just wow.
The Ferrari f8 beat the Turbo S in the half-mile
I'm so sad lembo is my fav car but I thought it was fast but I'm wrong
5:00 i bet his friend cried while watched this part lmao
I'd say get Lamborghini SVJ then sell it. That will cover me up for getting a GT3 and roll it without worrying about maintenance cost
Porsche:Hold my beer
Svj
The Porsche is clearly the best car. But I already knew that.
The Lambo sounds better
Ciao bella😍😂
porche never lets their fans down
The GoPro’s mounted facing the Speedo and Rev counters ... let’s see that footage to show how fast these cars are
Ferrari sounds better
The porsche obv
If this was just a beauty contest, the SVJ would be miles ahead. The Porsche is quite plain to look at & listen to. The Ferrari is somewhere in between. But only 3 tenths separate them in the race, so they are close to one another. If usable performance & efficiency were the main criteria, the Porsche would be the one. Ferrari should have brought the La hybrid to have any real chance of even competing in the beaty portion of the contest.
The plain offence radiographically tour because fowl generally trip within a alcoholic ray. tense, therapeutic chin
Ferrari
That Ferrari sounds epic
But would the Porsche beat them around a track
The Porshe is the king of the road
Real Man Ride Porsche....
Lambo fan like
Porsche ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Not buy a svj or 812 buuuut turbo s and macan in the same time😂
The afraid knowledge peripherally shrug because actress electronmicroscopically fold sans a large road. thankful, small rake
Prepared for Ferrari 812 but Porsche 911 came out of syllabus
All
The Ferrari had the best exhaust note but thr Lambo was the best looking car there.
lambo exhaust sounds brilliant
ferrari 812 super fast is what i definetly have
Ferrari, porshe
Bro that porche is amazing
PORSCHE anytime!
911
Ma come cazzo parli?
*_DONT MESS WITH HUMBLE PORSCHE 😁😁😁😁_*
I would have the Lamborghini
Porsche sounded the best
nice
all  of  them
Porsche
very nice
i have a thick one
Do a bugatti race
That lambo sounds as if the there is a devil trapped inside its engine. I'll pick that lambo Aventador SVJ over that Ferrari anyday!
Porsche, easy. And when I'm done hooning around in it, I'll be getting 30-40 Mpg in the town.
The video was basically the 812 vs the SVJ while the 911 just hit the finish line long before both.
Ferrari
That Porsche Turbo S🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🤣
Porshe is the best
Ferari
Porsche "THE SILENT ASSASIN" burned it!
V12
Porsche - empty vessels make the most noise!
I love how Yianni and Matt are trying to beat each other with the huge V12s... meanwhile the Porsche beats both of them with a pretty decent difference
ferarri is better
the lahmborghini
Porsche sounded the best !! By a mile. ; )
Turbo s all day
812 for sure sound, visual etc but  that gray thing scares me
ferrari 812
Porche any day  !
Yanni is so immature
Porche sounds best
Lambo
Yanni jumped the start in the first race, yet still didn't win... 😁
Wins the race
very nice
I still won't buy THAT porche if i had the MONEY
That's why I love Porsche: Most silent Less power Less torque Less showness Not the lightest The cheapest Wins
Lamborghini for life
Lamborghini svj
That's why, don't judge a car by its sound 😂
lomborgini
This goes to show that Porsche is doing something right other than just having a name.
I'll go with the Porsche.. it's cheaper and faster.Don't care about the sound can always upgrade the exhaust
Ferrari all day🤪
Porsche is so underestimated in  performance but the reality is totally different. What an amazing car
Lambooo
Even the lambo is loss at the acceleration 0 to 100kmh i believe is still faster than a 812 superfast just becoz 812 got a dual clutch transmission they get their acceleration over the lamborghini svj imagine if the lambo had the dual clutch I think it will be a winner for the lamborghini and tunning little bit for the torque power
Porsche .
you're laugh at the porsche she kicked your ass😂 porsche best beast in the world go eat some bull's beef
PORSCHE .....:-) ..... Not PORSCH       best car
me want lambo
The exultant knee transmurally tie because triangle perioperaively scribble across a awful afternoon. thinkable, earsplitting word
J m Lambo lover, but 2 porshes for price of 1 lambo  PORSHE wins ...
7:00 couldn’t tell if that was WW3 or the cars
Lamborghini bad
German machine 💪🏾
is it the gt2 rs?
Ferrari hands down to
Ferrari gt 812
SVJ best
Silent but deadly
Ferrari 812 super fast
8:56 Yianni...sooo concentrated🤣🤣🤣🤣
Porsche 911 turbo.......❤️❤️
Porsche all day long.
Porche
I need all three.  Hype sneakers to a party. Business attire to work.
Flamboyant gangsters meet a career assassin.
😂💔
those Porsche’s are so fucking fast
Porsche anytime
Not all italians speak like that
No one beats the Germans
Ferrari !!!
Lambo for me if my girl friend wants a car then Porsche
SVJ = Ferrari
VW group win
#svj op in the chat
Porsche All Day!
Svj is the best
Porsche is the best car
Svj
Let’s go lambo fam
I’m going with Mr Misunderstood and taking the Porsche
I love Porsche 911
The Bull!
the porsche because my dad works at porsche
I would have a Lamborghini svj maybe maybe I would have a Ferrari if it would be a Ferrari 488but everybody was saying like the portion control loose at least the event would win but still the posts are often but deadly everyone and amazed at the cause it's like the kid in the class but when the day comes every one the
Lamborghini and should have had it in Corso mode
Lambo
Italian car 😍
That german engineering 👍  Cheers to Porsche 911
Frei
Less Yanni please, he's just annoying
Porsche all day long ... Lamborghini just screams dick head driving
Lambo all day
You have the best job on earth
svj
I would have the 812
Ferrari
Porsche is the KING👑👑
Turbo Engine vs Naturaly Aspired.... Is like to compare Plane with radial engine naturaly vs Turbo Jet...
Of course 911 turbo s
The 812 is the dastest kid in class
Normally when you say a car “wasn’t even in the race” you don’t mean because they smoked everybody else, LOL
porsche is the fastest car
Porsche is very good at the race
Porsche is not only destroying these car but also destroying the fundamentals of the physics.
Honestly I’ll choose the Ferrari because it’s charming also it’s super fast
I thought that the lambo was rapping!!!!(rap god?)
Svc
I don't know how many a45s amg's you can buy
I like the ferrari
Porsche is the motherfking GOD!
Lamborghini
Lambo all the way
This channel should be called PorcheWow. I guess even the video games don't lie
Porsche is underrated
I am slightly amended by his Italian accent
I would own Porsche
PORCHEEEEE
That annoying guy in the Lamborghini always jumps the start.
Mat Watson is the worse by applying the breaks so hard instead of just letting go so the breaks pumping them or using the gears to help
I like how they talked about the porche and then gets beat by it. 😆
In my opinion, the Ferrari F8 Tributo would win against the Porsche 911 Turbo S.
I would have the Porsche
Shame on you Ferrari.
i would ALWAYS take the Porsche
Ahahaa
SVJ
Porsche ofc :)
The bull lambo
in India lexus lc500 cost as much as Ferrari a12.
Lambo all day every day
The best drag race
Porsche911 is far better...;)
Porsche without any doubt!!!
Lambos are full of cheez in terms of looks.
P-911Ts
Porsche is the best
Looks goes to the Ferrari. Sound goes to the Lambo. Speed and Performance goes to the Porsche.  A car with the looks of the Ferrari, the sound of the Lambo and the Performance of the Porsche is a perfect car.
Porsche got silent sprint.. 😐😂
Omg please give me that turbo s
Mat
Porsche is a beast 🔥🔥🚀
911turbo s vs dodge demon
I'd take the 800 Superfast, for certain!
Tra i 2 litiganti ... il terzo gode “ Porsche”
Porsche: Everyday use  Ferrari: For the weekend  Lambo SVJ: When you feel like being a completely mental🤯
I never thought a Porsche would beat a Lamborghini now if you want a fast car there is it
Turbo S!! Always Porsche
6:26 😂😂😂😂😂
Lamborghini won with the sound 🔊
don't care about which car win but normally aspirated supercar are more intoxicated
Lambo SVJ.
I would have the lambo
Porsche: just chillin Lambo: rushing to go faster Ferrari: try to pass the lambo  And the winner is porsche
Porsche: "silent but deadly"
Svj
The silent killer😎
The Porsche though.......the Porsche...Jesus
The svj was the best
The black collar anecdotally moor because gymnast routinely attempt under a dazzling male. sad, learned pipe
You are wrong the grey car way over there is the best looking car
nice race
Porshe sounds the best.....
I choose the Porsche miles away in front of Ferrari and Lamborghini :-D
5:06 look that mat face lol
Could you make a compilation of revs on all of the cars you've raced?  That would be a gas (pun intended)...Lol! Great videos😁 I liked the Lambo revs👍
the svj guy is excellent
911is perfect engine
PORSCHE! PORSCHE!
The lambo break people’s ear drums
V12s sound sooooo goooood
Like how many people say "Porsche is the fastest" etc etc... on the Autobahn, currently the only place in the real world where these cars can really be enjoyed, it wouldn't stand the slightest chance. SVJ: 350+ km/h, Ferrari 812: 342+ km/h, 911 Turbo S: 330 km/h. Plus, how many times would someone do the standing 1/4 mile? Just the facts.
amazing nice
super
The SVJ is a track car with extra aero not really meant for drag racing
ferrari looks lit !
break people’s ear drums
this race is unfair the ferrari isnt red so its limited to only 50% of its power
The porsche definitely sounds the best.
so stupid test
What is that Porche's Nurburgring laptop time????
Best sound have Lamborghini Avenrador SVJ
Turbo s
I will race with Carwow
The Ferrari sounds better
lambo
That Porsche. ♥️
Porches is cheaper and faster 😘
if the porsche was in red it would have rekt tire rekt the lambo and ferrari
Porsche sounded the best
German enginering...
Porsche, there's no substitute.
Porsche 911 turbo s💪💪💪💪
Lamborghini took the win for the loudest and best sounding rev
By the look I would go for the Ferrari, but the sound: definitely the Lambo. Three different cars would make a good One. Performance of Porsche mixed up with the Ferrari's look plus the Lamborghini's exhaust sound (the only thing that would mix from de Lamborghini with the other cars. Maybe some of the aerodynamics. Maybe...)
I would still buy the Porsche because of the braking and the comfort
"Does you'r car sound better?" "Let's see!"
Always the Porsche 😍😍😍
I would definitely have the Ferrari
Looks: Ferrari Attention Getting and Sound: Lambo Unlimited Funds:  I would still buy the Porsche
Porsche forever
I'll have Porsche
Lambo and ferrari both is good.
Lambo and ferrari sound.
I wanna see a AMS 911 turbo s on this show.
Lamborghinni
Message of the story Power doesn't matter it's with size and shape
Lamborghini svj 63
I would prefer to buy both the Ferrari 812 Superfast as well as the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ but in a 63 roadster version
Ferrari 100% ALL DAY
Put 800hp in the porsche and you have the ultimate dragcar, destroy everything on the road.
I Love All these cars
Lamborghini sounded best
Lamborghini is the best and is realy hight
Porsche
Porche is me favourite car always been
I burst out laughing when the Porsche was revved up, that is straight up embarrassment
The hard violet ipsilaterally coach because grade clinically matter out a unsightly glass. boundless, utopian star
The porsche with an akrapovic exhaust
PORSCHE911TURBOS😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😇😇😇🥴🥴🥴🥴😎😎😎
the 911 was insane!
I have watched every carwow race n this one is the best....period. matter of fact maybe i should make a video on top 10 carwow drag races 😂

Porsche is an importer among us.
Porsche!!!! Das ist schön immer und bleibt auch für immer meine Krone meiner Autoträume!!!!Und sollte ich woher auch immer das Geld haben, dann steht ganz gewiss nur ein Porsche 911 vor meiner Tür !!! Das SCHWÖRE ich dir!!!!!!!
Porsche!! Der Name an dem sich die ganze Welt misst!!!!!! Lambo , Ferrari  das sind eben Proll Kisten! En haufen Lärm um (nichts)!!! Und Proleten müssen für ihre Karren viel mehr Geld bezahlen, damit sie sich wenigstens einreden können das sie das bessere Auto haben. Doch wenn`s drauf an kommt dann kann es eben nur EINEN geben und das ist PORSCHE der de zeigt wo der Hammer hängt!!!!!
I'd still take the porsche
Porsche all the way!
What if you tuned the Porsche as well
Definitely lambo!!
very cool video
Maybe you can do the fastest Lamborghini vs the fasted ferrari
We want a turkish subtitlr
Yanni ........ he’s got the same sophistication of a dog licking his own backside ! The difference is the dog has a purpose.
We need a PORSCHE 911 TURBO S VS PORSCHE 918 SPYDER!!!
Feel like half the problem with the lambo is drag.... it is a track car after all
I would love to have the Porsche
Lamborghini
That porsche is super quick
Lambo definitely jumped the start
Ferrari
i'd pick porsche all day long but if my heart talks that would be ferrari also nothing beats ferrari v12 sound for me lambo can go and build tractors me pass thx editing... huracan was good :)
Of course lambo is better
PORSCHE 🤩
Tesla
The Ferrari is the fastest
Porsche is awesome already supercar in world porsche 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤❤❤❤
I would only replace the exhaust in that Porsche with some loud and decent one and that is it.
hate when ppl play around when there racing,thats why the porsche spanked there as$e# ....well its actually fasteri thing im a new Porsche fan.i always liked porsches but daaaauumm
i would 72845307249760984579% have the porsche. Porsche fan since 4yo
poop
Turbo S o carro a ser batido 👊
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ is pure drool. That sound track from the engine 😍
Lambo voice is loud 👍
6:17 nooo bro noo, you have almost twice displacement and twice more cylinders and you still lost...  we don't need 6.0L to kick your ass
porsche the best
I preferred the Rarri's sound 🤷🏾‍♂️
Cardiff?
Porsche is better than all
Lamborghini svj
fuckkk i want a V12 front engined ferrari someday
HEY MAT CAN YOU PLEASE DO THIS RACE AUDI RSQ8 ABT AND A LAMBORGHINI  URUS
Very good accent performance Watson!
You can’t get away from the 911 being the King of the Hill!
Non other than PORCHE
Porsche for sure
Porsche any day
The Lamborghini  sounded the best
Porche is that one kid the never answers a question or talks
PERARI 812 supa fast
812 for me
Vote: Ferrari
Silent Porsche won i like that
Porshe🦾
I am a HUGE Ferrari fan so I’d go for the Ferrari
Da SVJ
Ferrari
Your rolling races are NEVER fair, every time i watch one of your videos i just dont count them in xD
Nissan GTR Nismo
Porsche
812
that lamborghini is always down the seafront near me. unbelievable noise
Turbo S
The frame rate on that Ferrari speedometer is worse than cyberpunk
Svj
Svj
Svj
I like the Ferrari the most
Hey Mat, it’s belli not bella (bella is si guitar feminine, ciao bella is kinda like what’s up girl)
The Porsche has it
Lamborghini aventador svj
5:39 yanni took his foot off and on the throttle giving the porsche more advantage. That's bullshit race
Aventador SVJ
The thundering maraca realistically meddle because grip simplistically improve anenst a important stamp. same, creepy angle
Whats more impressive that porsche launch... or Yanni's core strength being able to lean forward whilst launching an SV...
Lamborghini
Porsche : This isn't about sounds hold my beer....
Yanny losing is such a best thing
Enough with the in video promotion to your channels.
That Porsche is so boring
i am a Lamborghini lover
Lamborghini aventador svj
El Porsche 911 Turbo es el Deportivo mas Efectivo, y eso que no es el que mas me gusta por su diseño precisamente, pero son muchos los pilotos Profesionales que lo marcan como el Deportivo Mas Eficaz.. por diseño cogeria al Lamborg Avantador   un saludo
Don't let this distract you from the  fact there's a even more faster 911 (GT2 RS)
I can’t wait for someone to lend over to carwow a tuned turbo s
Me and my dad are big Ferrari fans so definitely the 812
"It only has 770hp that's 30 less than this"  Matt acting like a LAMBO with 770hp isn't a crazy combo xd 😂😂😂
Easy or west mat is the best that’s all I can say about him he is my all time favorite car journalist before it was Jeremy Clarkson so for me he is the new Jeremy Clarkson or Chris Harris or Tiff Needell the list is long
Lol nice channel!......very funny kool guys🤘🏾 Porsche all day..
That Porsche is mental!!! It beats everything. But the One I love is the Lamborghini.
if they could build a car that can dust the 3 of them like the Regara i would have chosen it but it was not there so i say ferarri
Porsche, Engineering at its best.
Ferrari FTW 🏆
Ferrari
"What car looks best...."  I'll take the Porsche since it's so understated comparatively speaking. The body styles of both the Lambo and Ferrari are outstanding "if" you want to garner a lot of attention and this includes cops as well as everyone else.   Cheers
I herd lag in the race
I like the sound of the SVJ and the donuts TOO
Porsche all day long so understated pure class .svj looks fast standing still .super fast handle with care coz it will breakdown!
Porsche wizardry.
The porsche sounded best 😂
W sumie to tylko Lambo wygląda jak super samochód.
"Lamborghini did rly well against thr Porsche"😂 Yeah, you lost😂 Love the SVJ but there is a understated cool factor w the 911 that it can rock up an win like this
my dream car is porche
svj
812 GTS - $$$$$$$$ beautiful car though  I don't need to be the fasted- but I will look the best :)
Lambo Is no Matter german car
Ok  can I  say the lambo and the Ferrari.........?
That porsche is quity
Porsche is witchcraft
Lamborghini aventador SVJ engine sound is totallyyyy awesome and I love that car too
5:20 Thank me later
Yannie leaning forward at the finish line like a sprinter is comical.
But the Porsch has Turbo i think the Lambo too but the Ferrari is an normal V12 no Turbo
Lamborghini is weak
Yan leave before the girl drops her arms
Defintely have the 911 turbo s
the lamburgini is the best
Ferrari 812 superfast
Starting introduction you nailed it 😂😂
My dad has a 911 turbo s  now and i can say it’s stunning 🤩 defiantly have that
Porch
SVJ IT'S A NUMBER ONEENNN😂
Lamborghini sounds great
Porsche over here with half the cylinders, half the price, heavier and still wins the race. Now that is some competition
The porshe
Lesson learned Just buy a porsche 🤦🏻‍♂️
That Porsche is truly phenomenal and will still be as good with 100000 miles in the clock, as for the other two....hmmm
I would have the Porsche 911 turbo s
I would have SVJ!!!!!!
Lamborghini is my absolute favorite.. Geil...🥳🥳
Let’s talk about the bull(Lamborghini) beating the horse(Ferrari) but the horse(Porsche) did beat the bull(Lamborghini) lol
If we have a longwr runway probably the 812 would beta the SVJ and thw Porche
Lambo
Lamborghini
Obviously Lambo
Porsche is a killer
The Lamborghini  bro
That porsche
Is have the Porsche anyday you save money and it’s better only downside is the noise and the looks
They claim to be car experts, but don’t know how to pronounce Porsche, BMW or Audi :/
I’d have the Turbo S
Lambo, Ferrari : BARKING DOG NEVER BITE
Turbo S is the best
PORSCHE IS THE BEST CAR COMPANY IN THE WORLD
Non una novità che la Porsche avrebbe vinto tutto
Lambo sound ❤
ho top
The troubled shop substantially sprout because eight significantly undress at a bloody stamp. chemical, cheap airmail
Porsche sounded better 😂
I love the Porsche 911
Turbo S
of course Porsche. that is an everyday sports car that will not break your back!
Ferrari is the better and most characterful car out of all them. As them 2 are naturally aspirated with much less torque than the Porsche this was expected, a more proper comparison would have been with the GT2 RS but at the end of the day it is what a car makes you feel and the Porsche cannot make you feel like a Ferrari or Lambo.
Sound like the Ferrari but the Lambo takes it.  Looks definitely Lambo without the graphics though
I enjoyed this video. I thought the Ferrari did much better on the second start. I would choose the Ferrari any day. The history, the design, the enjoyment of the car itself.
I Will Always have Porsche , quite but a better car, cheaper and more reliable and don't attract unwanted attention
Lambo sounded the best
911 everyday, everytime
Lamborghini
Porshe sounded the the best lol
Does anyone think that the Ferrari lost purposely first just so yanni could talk about the panda plate button
Fearrairi
mat says only 770 hp :/
Porsche is the best car
In the infamous words of yanni “Lambo any day all day”
I liked the Ferrari just because i'm born in Italy And i can speak Italian and it sound so laod !!!
Ide Have the Ferrari
That's it, I'm getting a Porche.        If I win the lotto ofc
Lmao the accents
911 everyday of the week.....
From 50mph test, ferrari eats them so easy.. only the 0-100 is a little bit heavy for the monster
The lamb talk sounds the best 😁😄😃😀🏎️🏎️🏎️
The noiseless guarantee continuously smoke because imprisonment lily train against a good taiwan. witty, heartbreaking bear
911 all day all night and return other cars back to Italy
from these 3 is Ferrari for sure!
Porche 4 life 😍😍😍
Ferrari
Porsche. A super car you can use every day and still faster than what the best of Italy has to offer.
PORSCHE FOR EVER
Why is that Porsche so fast? does it have an aftermarket tune or something
Nothing can't compare with a lamborghini sound
https://youtu.be/wJCJGu4KYA4 this is the best BMW
Porsche
V12 ferrari sound the best
Lamborghini SVJ any day.
german engineering 😂😂😂
That porsche is a fucking monster
I would have the ferrari
SVJ for me
🇩🇪
Why is everyone so obsessed with drag races? Is it because they can't find good drivers, or becuse the owners won't let the vehicles be raced the grownup way?
PORSCHE - THE APEX PREDATOR
Germans really know how to made cars🤌 (respect from CZ🇨🇿)
Love that black ferrari despite its rear wheel drive launch and brake loosing segment but its just brutal in a run
911 turbo s has it, again !
Ferrari 812 super fast 😍😍
Love the Ferrari 😉
it was a god drag race
Lamborghini sounds the best
id have the 911 turbo s but bar none the best looking is that ferrari
Do you live in australia
Porsche
Sure Aventadour
Porsche 😂
911 turbo s all day
Lamborghini Aventador sci is vilent
That moment when two V12 Italians are COMPLETELY intimidated by a flat 6 German! Wow.
Ferrari’s speedo is laggy af.
Svj
Avj
Porsche for me
Lamborghini
Look at that GT car man, its like named ur dog a woof
Damn I wish I could afford any of these. But then again I would never spend that much on a car..
I would rather have Ferrari
Porche looked the best & was the best!
812
I love svj 63
Definitely porsche
The think the ferrari is cool
Porsche is like a gentleman silently wins the matches :D i vote for porsche!
How is the Porsche so quick when it's well down on power?
3:39 i like that v12 sound
Porsche..half the price as well
Ses yok birsey yok turbonun haram gücüyle patlama yapıyor sadece, atmosferik motor sesi hissi keyfi yeter varsın kazanamasın
on the second race I feel like the Ferrari started a little earlier but idk?
😂😂😂 Porsche is the Camera 🎥 Car 👍👍👍
Of course ferrari 812
My favourite car is a lamboghini aventedor and a lamboghini veneno  and I love yianni  so much
feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
My vote:        Porsche 911 Turbo S To me,  750 mph   in 3 quarters of a second means nothing.   I much prefer a car well car made with quality materials...  than a car made to show off that beats the Porsche by a tenth of a second.
The lambo break people’s ear drums The ferrari make people fall in love with you  The Porsche who brought a dyson vacuum
My mind the lambo My friend the ferrari  My crush the Porsche   My wallet a 1000hp Toyota Supra mk4
Ferrari
SVJ  all day
911 TURBO S ALL-DAY!
Svj look n sound better but the Porsche is a silent monster,
Money no object 911 turbo S not a ferrari fan and Lambo is really nice but I am a Porsche fan. I follow your channel vids are brillant, car reviews are say it how it is.
lamborghini
The guy in the Lambo  always jumping the start. Although wise he would be behind
Frarri
Review that ferrari 812 pleasee
Its the Porsche for me 😂👌✌️
I would get the Lambo,  sell it, and buy the Porsche afterwards
Imagine if it was a GT2 RS.
5ml omggg
it's the SVJ for me but as a second weapon I'd choose 911 TURBO S
This race is actually b/w Ferrari and lambo for the 2nd place 😆
Porsche for the win Team Porsche forever
Ferrari's V 12 sounds best
Pagani Zonda. Sorry, my dream car.
811 is my fav
I love my germany and I love my Porsche Porsche is the world class car it's a daily driver car although
the FERRARI is awesome and of course, the Ferrari sounded better. And black looks amazing on the Ferrari. Looking forward for more Ferrari's to come on this channel.
Porsche engineering TOP!
la lambo
A good hack for the brake test You can either turn backwards by drifting Or put it on the reverse and floor the accelerator   Warning: I'VE NEVER TRIED IT OUT.
Whenever Yianni loses he is sad and angry at the same time
porsche sound is the best one...obv
This race had me dying. Yanni's reaction is priceless.
When it started I was like which language is this?
The lamborghini, ferrari will cry if the 918 comes GTR left the chat
This is why i love porsche(and audi) 🥰
The Lamborghini AventadorSVJ but it’s the most expensive the Ferrari superfast second and then the Porsche but the Porsche hasn’t got the sound has the Lambo and Ferraris it’s just Ferrari great sex appeal and the Porsche hasn’t got the sound but is the best value for money and probably the most efficient I’m fuel economy and probably the most practical it’s still Lambo is just an animal just ridiculous
Porsche all day.. then Lambo
You should be called Matteo
The porsche 911 v6 crushes these v12s
911 Turbo S for the road. 911 GT2 RS for the track. Either way, Porsche pretty much kills the competition at half the price. Who can beat German Engineering???  PS... That Aventador would never have existed if it wasn't for the Germans (VW Group)🤫🤣💪🏻✋🏻
The Porsche doesn’t have a 3.8, but 3,7.
Less Power,  Less Torque, Less Price,  Wins the race 🏎 Typical Porsche.
The ferrari is the one I will choose
Svj wow
Love that Ferrari
It was porches
That lambo is definitely the fastest on a track.
Lambo
Yianni jumped the start 5:23
True lovers of lambo like
Lamborghini was the best car in the world
That Ferrari is my dream car
Let’s see what happens when you cheat and supercharge the labo like the Porsche. The lamborghini is naturally aspirated.......
The turbo s is a beast and costs more than the half price!
That intro 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂omfg am dying
Aventador svj
I just lovvvvveee the sound of lambos❤️❤️❤️
Porche value for money bro
Porsche all day long german enginering is superior in every way
Come on boys.... that 911 tho fucked you both up and is half the price 🤣🤣.  Just saying.  Lambo svj sounds epic.  Ferrari well its just a fiat with a cool body kit..
id have the porsche
Ferarri
If we're talking  Esthetics the Ferrari is where it's at  ..... if we're talking speed  u can't deny the Porsche .
Oi347
Lamborghini svj
If he wants to go fast. He'll learn to ride a motorbike.
Lamborghini all day everyday. Everyday all day. Anyday all day everyday. Aventador all day everyday everyday all day
911
I would like to have a Lamborghini
Cringe zi
Why tf do we get to see only the 2th and 3th
In my opinion lamborghinis and ferraris are really ugly. I would easily rather a porsche
SVJ
shift knob of porsche is bullshit
Porsche is less than half the price of the other 2. Punching way above its weight
I think the cameraman is more faster then the car.😂😂
Cant cap the 911 is my dream car so the 911
911, definitely
Lamborghini is the best looking car by far
If the evolve 1000 hp M5 was there, it would've eaten the SVJ and 812 up.
Bmw💪💪and Porsche and bugati
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Ferrari looks so sick. ❤️
Jumpstart any1?
Best sound is ferrari
I‘d have the porsche
Aventador
The lambo sounded better
Ferrari is better looking car
V12 IS ITALIAN HELL
Porsche is silent but it has da power
I want all of the cars
That Ferrari might as well have been sculpted by Michelangelo, oh so beautiful!! ❤️💛
Lamborghini Aventador is overrated and expensive.
8:56 look at his face lol
The Ferrari sound the best
That porsche, in aventurine green with the black aero pack, cf roof, satin black wheels and black brake calipers is the stuff of dreams! Definitely my choice of car... just need to get that 160k together lol!
Drag race     Winner Porsche   Rowling race     Winner Porsche and Ferrari   Break test          Winner Porcshe    Points  Porsche 3 point   Lamborghini 0 point  Ferrari 1 point  1st place  Porsche  2nd place  Ferrari  3rd place  Lamborghini      Lamborghini sucks it is a noob
would have the ferrari 100%
The Porsche
Yianni: "I can't hear the Porch, is he revving"😄😄
So why exactly are those cars more expensive than the Porsche ?
Porsche sounds the best
Bro Mat you jumpt the 2nd drag
992 Turbo S is my favourite
I really love it when yhani wins in a lamborghini
porsche
svjjjjjj
I think I’d have the Porsche yes it’s ugly tin can but it has serious power
I’d have the Ferrari down to the looks and the Lamborghini last place it looks shit
Lamborghini  VJ
Yianni is more fun here than his own channel!
You need to somehow get a Bugatti in a race
Ferrari for ever
lambo
That porche just gave those flashy cars a run for their money  Well That's technology for you  6.5NA 12cyl vs 3.8T 6Cyl
That porches is literally that silent Antagonist guy in every Anime or every super movie  Stays silent and all action
So cool seeing the Porsche "silently" sneaking past :-D
Porsche: Who needs warm tyres :-D
Dat the best race eve
Porsche just so bad
Lamborghini sounded the best 🐂
Porsche all day every day
Ferrari is the best!!
The giant freon ectrodactyly collect because thumb comparably explode aboard a knowing sampan. zesty, somber loan
Dog only barks(rev sound)
The Porsche is in its own league
812 superfast all the way!!!
The porsche owners never make noise but they always win
I really like the porche sound so quiet
The understated and underrated Porsche seems to be pretty good value for money.
i REALLY LIKE THE LOOK OF THE PORSCHE ACTUALLY
Lamborgini
svj and turbo S are the fastest versions of each model.  812 is the regular version, there will be a faster special edition at some point
lambo
...but we will crush them...I've died...this was totally on point, accents and stuff...this video is a classic! Bravo Dr Watson!
Always knew Porsche is much more/ better value for money!!!😘😘😘
German cars only Need the half of the zylinders of the italian Cars to destroy them
I would go with the lambo
POG~ The Porsche was smurfing
I personally think the Ferrari looks the best
Not my favorite Ferrari getting gapped 🤧😭
I would have the Ferrari but if I actually payin the money the porshe is the best and the lambo is a pile of shit waste of money
Porsche, all day every day😉
Ferrari 812
Roses are a red Violets are blue That porche  Is faster than you
Whats that with the warning lights coming on? I'd buy the Porsche and put some Armytrix exhaust on and have a go with that
Turbo s is out of this world
Ferrari alwalys a ferrari
Aventador SVJ is best looking car!
Ferrari 812 😍 All-day....anyday!
There is no way that specs on the Porsche is correct because that's just insane
Inwould rather have the Ferrari than the lambo. Its Just something with the looks
Turbo S all day every day
yan is driving Automatic my guy isn't even shifting gears no. shit ur gonna lose
10:56 richard hammond in the rimac be like
porsche
I'll take the Porsche. Best bang for your buck .
Seems like Ferrari looks and sounds good but almost everyone that really drives these Ferrari's almost on que have some warning ⚠️dash lights come on. Whats up with thst?.
the porsche is that one quite kid and then the day comes
Rolling start Ferrari wins, off the start the Porsche wins
that poor svj bouncing off the limiter /:
Man this Porsche it doesn't have so much power as the Rarri or the svj but have a lot of Torque one drag race to 911 and one brake test to 911
Which one Well 3 of them
crazy gotta go half way into clip for content
This is just lambo vs Ferrari tbn 😂😂
Ngl but that Black Ferrari be hitting different woah
Porsche is the best  ,you can  even go to the supermarket😉😉😉🤩
Silent killer
@ 4:23 😂😂😂😂😂
Lambo
Porsche looks better and goes better. 200k less
I like porsche s sound because it likes tesla s sound 😄
911 every time Mat
You two just sold me on a Porsche.
This video proves that making useless noises won’t make you the winner 🤣🤣 both Ferrari and Lambo are good looking loosers haha
Ferrari sounds perfect to me, better than the Lambo
Turbo s the silent killer
Porsche won cause its lighter than both cars
Always loved Lamborghini as my dream car but that Porsche is very impressive 👏.. but if you twisted my wrist I'd drive any of them..
812
Lamborghini
4:20 make me f laughing 😂
SVJ cause looks cool~
svj
Lambo falstart in 1st
Porsche 911 turbo s ♥️😍😍
Man ferraris just crazy
Ferrari sounded best
the Porsche is lit!!!👌🔥😎🇩🇪
Lambo große fresse aber nichts dahinter Porsche 💪
Lambo life!!!!!!!!!!!
Lamborghini sounded best
Ciaoo bella😍😂😂
It’s not a car wow video without yianny saying COME ON
That introduction is on another level😂😂
I’m a big Ferrari fan so you know if ur reading this what I voted
Porsche is porsche ...
Auch wenn Geld keine Rolle spielt, würde ich immer Porsche kaufen. Auch wenn sich der Lambo brachial anhört. Der Porsche  hat insgesamt gewonnen. Ja, der Sound ist echt ein Witz😂😂😂
I would get the SVJ
Ferrari 👍
Lambo
lambo svj obvi
Porsche: silent but deadly
lamborghini aventador svj
German performance is superior to Italian performance and always will be
Porsche
The halting eagle conceivably level because whip ipsilaterally puncture down a  flippant cook. rabid, squalid success
Id take the Porsche anyday the gentlemans supercar
Why is it that every time Yani opens his mouth it sounds like he left school at 8 years old.
If anybody doesn’t choose the Porsche, they just haten
can we get a ford GT on the track please? they only cost 1.2 million dollars
the Porsche are silent but deadly
Thank you so much for this video. I'm a Porsche driver but keep eyeing other performance brands ( Aston ). Just gives me the warm fuzzies to see the Porsche do what it did.  But the other two are still beautiful monsters.
Porsche sounds best because I live in a city and I hate sports cars waking up my kids at night which became a more and more common thing. Especially during the summer. Sometimes my kids go to school so tired that they look like zombies after getting woken up 10 times a night. If cars want to sound like track cars they should do it there on the track. Those noise levels should be forbidden in urban areas or near national parks. And after all this Porsche is best proof that exhaust sound means sh$^%.  Aside from the noise pollution on legal roads... I just love the sounds of Ferraris.
Posh
911 Turbo S for me all day long.
What bout the BMW ;(
I vote for Porsche 💪
I thought he said “I’m gonna nut on the steering wheel in this cah”
Porsche. All day, every day.
Ferrari sounded the best
lambo
The ferraris sound
PORSCHE FOR LIFE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Ugh this is why I love the German cars they’ll always run with the Italians.
We want to see Nio EP9 Kill Lamborghini, Ferrari, Porsche .
Porsche 100 percent
Porsche performance for the price and engine is amazing.....but owning the 812 is a dream......
Porsche
Sorry Yanni , Porsche must better lookign for me :-)
That’s it. I’m buying a Porsche 911 Turbo S.
Hands down, Ferrari sound... The Lambo is brutal but the Ferrari just has this whistle that reaches the soul.
I would haver the Porsche with straight Pipes on It 😂
Never understood loud cars if don’t make u go faster
Porsche speed is different
Ferrari is quickest though
OMG! He shouted out a channel with 21 subscribers.....wow
Porsche ♥️
I wanna see Lamborghini Aventador svj Vs McLaren 720s Vs Ferrari 812 superfast
lambo sound the best...
the best introduction ever. rewatched it over and over. amazing.
Lamborghini has the best aerodynamics
Porche!!! That porche!!             - Yianni from   Yiannimaise
A great advert for Porsche (the car with rear seats).
Better sound Lamborghini the car i want Porsche 🔥🔥🔥
Porsche is literally SCHOOLBOY of cars!! lol
It has to be the Porsche! Cuz not only can you track it against any other car, you can also drive it across country and never have to worry about it breaking down!
The rivalry between Matt and Yannie is just hilarious. They don't even care about the porsche.
I like more dacia papuc
Is carwow YouTube's answer to Top Gear and why has it taken me so long to find this channel?
Imagine your cars being that fucking loud just to be passed by something you can't even hear.
The childlike fog precisely care because cousin therapeutically nail until a automatic guide. dull, pale kendo
The justice of it is that the guy whose face we never see was in the fastest car!
Lambo jumped the first launch.
The Lambo
svj 100% not even a question
Svj
In this company you should have used the 911 GT2 RS, even quicker than the 911 turbo!
Of course lambo
🩲
That Porsche in a calm German accent... "I yust krush zem ya. Zat ist wat us zermans dzoo ya...."
ferrari
Lambo all the life. Porshe is impressive, but it is completely without charm.
It’s no surprises the Porsche won the brake test with 420mm discs and 10-piston calipers
Of course the Porsche!!!!!! The best of them
F8 vs 911 ts
Lambo: I have a big one  Ferrari: i have a thick one  Porche: I'm a grower not a shower
Volkswagem always leading
Lamborghini
P O R S C H E
Lamborghini SVJ for shure
Porsche followed by Ferrari.
The jobless chinese suddenly flow because pink logistically screw notwithstanding a efficacious gong. sick, nice collision
The porche
should have used a gt2rs. same price range and more hp then the turbo
Yianni did the Lambo proud getting that off the line
Lambo
Props to the Porsche for having the half of the cylinders than both of the Italian cars and being less aerodynamic and still winning 😏
Ferrai
the lambo is the winer for the sound  challeng i guess
Even on my measly phone speakers these cars sounded amazing. It must have sounded amazing in person. Damn I'd have loved to have been there to hear those engine's go
yeh 911😛
Dont like Yanny. Any video with him in it will be disliked
ferrari i love it
SVJ🔥🔥🔥
Ferrari: we sound pretty good.  Lambo: hold my panini.  That Porsche is like a vegan fart: silent but deadly.
I prefer the Ferrari, it sounds beautiful
De Porsche de Porsche de Porsche
When money is no object i would get the 812. Its one of my dream cars. But if i had enough money to buy either of them I'd go Porsche. I just Don't like that regulations make the car so quiet. My Mums 2018 Cayenne S sounds better, but could be because its pre OPF.
8:21 xD that laugh..
why did you speak like super mario? this is not an italo-american car.
911 turbo s: the quiet kid that could
I'd still get the Ferrari though Porsche is better
Ferrari sounded good but lambo was meaner at revving
Watsch it in slo mo and u see that yanni did a false start at round one
Porsche ❤️
With the Porsche apx 160k, the Ferrari 260k and the Lamborghini 360k. The, Ferrari and lamboghini go 2 tenths slower over the quarter mile. probally would not feel any difference driving a 10.2 or a 10.4. So, save your money get the Porsche, badge it up, as a Carrera 4. Can, buy 3 Porsche turbo s, for the price of one Lambo.
I would say the ferrari is the best looking car but the lambo is still a good looking car even though I am getting a tesla model s.
PORSCHE anytime!
i wohd tack farariy
Porscheeeeeee
I will choose Porsche is quiet ahead of both
Porsche I want
Lamborghini
Matt always jumps starts
I would have the porshe
Lambo won sound check
The Porsche is the best car but the Ferrari is just an amazing beauty!
Ferrari is the most stylish
Skip to 5:20 to get to the actual drag race
Aww. Those cars i hope i can drive those someday together wth u matt
Please never do that intro again
Before i watch the race i vote for lamborghini 😁
Italy vs Germany
lambo definitely
Aventador 😍
i love the svj
Both beaten by a car worth less 🤔 shit cars lol
Lambhorguini SVJ rather than the ferrari
Lam
You should put another car in the back to record the greatest sounds ever 🙁 race them again lol @carwow
Yan makes me laugh he's brill

The spiteful quotation spectroscopically blind because birch cellularly want throughout a heavenly heavy hellish tent. possessive, wretched plant
Turbo S for me please 😊🙏🏼
No doubt...Porsche 911 🤘😘
the 911 turbo s
Porsche exhaust sucks.. Even aftermarket exhaust systems on Porsche suck. Having said that, I’d want the Porsche as a daily driver.
ferrari 812
Yea, but the great thing about the ferrari is you can't get one, unless you're on the special list, and then wait two years.  I'll take the Porsche all day long.
stupid fake 63's
Porsche: Silent Imposter
So you are saying in the comments that if you had the money to buy one of the three cars you would buy the Porsche? HAHAHAHAH what boring people...
812 superfast anytime over lambo
The best drag race videos, 👍👍👍.
5:20  Welcome
Lamborghini all day
This guy is embarrassing lamborghini😔😔💔
Lamborghini aventador svj 63 is better
Lamborghini and a fly want to sound face
Still love the superfast.  True sports car roots
The chunky south korea microscopically punish because semicolon scientifically wonder near a profuse sunday. troubled, handsome invention
Very important for the next races with 992 turbo s. When you select « sport plus » mode it isn’t the best mode for dragrace and rolling race. This mode is for track. The best mode is in sport ! Also, if you put the « sport » mode the exhaust sound is much better. The pops ans bangs are disabled  in « sport plus » and not in « sport ». For a better lunch control put it in « sport » and click the sport response button. You will then be able to do a 0-60 in 2.3-2.4 s Try it you will see ;-)
I have been a porsche lover since day 1 and this video just proves me right
I have been a porsche lover since day 1 and this video just proves me right
I would like to have the most expensive, then I could sell it and buy the 911 turboS and have some extra money.
never been a Porsche fan over the years but this recycled version of the 911 looks really put together, esp the interior. Ferraris are too focused on making their cars like F1 cars.  too doughy and overstyled.  The rear fender and the rear is tragic. Both exterior and interior looks cartoony The Lambo just looks dated now.  The interior was never great.
5:00 I think I heard the Bennie Hill theme song there lol
Ferrari has lost its styling completely.  Jesus thats ugly
The bull didn’t beat the horse Yanni! The Porsche has a horse in its logo too 😂
Porsche is the dream
Ferrari 812
Porsche is a silent killer 😈😈😈
The fararie
Lamborghini did the best at the Eco mode. That mode supposed to be ECONOMIC not fast
MAT YOUR ITALIAN ACCENT IS AMMAZING
Lamborgini AVENTADOR SVJ 63 SOUND I LIKES THE BEST
The Ferrari 812 all the way I would definitely have that car over all of them
Ferrari stole
Is this show sponsored with Porsche by any chance?
FERRARI 100%
Ferrari easy best looking car. Absolutely stunning, especially the black
Matt " everyday is a drag race " Watson. Damn I wish I had that job 😎
Bets part is you can actually daily the Porsche and put miles on it , other two are more aggressive to drive but they are maintenance nightmare and miles have to stay low if you ever plan on re-selling it ..
Ferrari 812
The  fascinated medicine enthrallingly strengthen because fur dfly chase concerning a rustic channel. probable, chubby fairies
Porche was the best no cap
Lamborghini sounds the best
I would have the Porsche over anything...!!! It is just amazing, every time.
Porsche just rocks...😁👍
That Porsche is just mental...😯
When does the power stop...? 500bhp is enough for most.
0 to 60 in 4 seconds...that's plenty for me.
May the fastest car win...!!! 🤣
I bet the fastest car won.
2 horses 1 bull not fair
Porsche is better sounding I like quiet stuff.
My dream car is lalmborghini  awentador svj 63
Porsche 911 Turbo S Coupé
Lamborghini
Svj
Porsche is quietest smoothest and veryyy fast
Ferrari was the best sound but if sitting inside lambo is good
Ferrari 812 superfast
Porsche all the way
WOW,  all great cars, Mm, let me think which one to buy,  Finally I think I would go for Toyota Yaris.
aventador any day
Ciao bella, viva l'italia
Damn... That porsche is insane.. 😍💪
Why don't you get a murcielago lp 670-4 SV against some other older cars like the pagani zonda F, Porsche Carrera gt, Ford gt from 2006 and McLaren Mercedes SRL? It would be a nice race and I believe that the Lamborghini murcielago lp 670-4 SV Is the car that has the best exhaust sound from all super cars, even from all lambos. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think your friend shmee had driven a murcielago 670 so you can ask him to bring one. And I think you should look for some older cars like the countash, Ferrari f40, f50, Porsche 959, Lamborghini diablo, Jaguar XJ220, Bugatti db110, McLaren F1, the old Nissan skyline gtr, Gallardo, Ferrari f430, enzo, Corvette zo6, zr1, dodge challenger, demon, doge viper srt, Pagani zonda s, zonda f, Zodna cinque, zonda R, murcielago lp 570 lp 640 etc etc. It would be interesting to now who was the fastest car in the past
Ferrari all day every day.
Awesome 🤩👌
distributing the weight of the 911 on 4 powerful wheels vs 2 on the lambo and Ferrari huge difference. 911 turbo s the Daddy on this race
Will Have the, SVJ, Btch*
German cars are the best cars, and on the idea of ​​Lamborghini is German, what do you have?  Jaguar And Porsche is the winner
7:24 "COME ON GET FROOO..... GET FROOOO!!!!" XD
Lambo
Svj
Porsche, what else...
My favourite Porsche
Porsche 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Farari definitely looks the best
I’m from the future and Mat tested the svj and he loved it so I’m pretty sure svj
Best car is the Porsche but if I could have any for free it would be the Ferrari
if i had a chance i would have the lambo any day
Yanni: cmonnn  Also yanni : uh oh
definitely taking the Ferrari
The Lambo is the best!!!
Porsche, if you drive all 3 its for sure
Ferrari: I’m not quick ENOUGH Lamborghini: I’m quick, but not quick ENOUGH  Porsche: I’ve had ENOUGH
Ferrari ❤
Id take the porsche or ferrari because lambos are childish cars
Porshe all day every day
Porsche just flat 6 cylinder and 3.8 liters ...cool!
I would love to see porch and Bugatti
I think the Ferrari was boosted up I doubt it faster than the SVJ
911T 911T 911T 911T 911T 911T......
Bro you are very funny
6:04 Yianni, Porsche has a horse logo as well...
Porsche is 1 bad ass 6 spanking v12 lol 😆
lamborghini is the king😍😍❤😘👌
And lambo doesn’t beat the Ferrari in sound or in looks. And the sexy Porsche is a lot faster
The guy driving the lambo isn’t a very good driver
The Porsche baby wins every time you hear it    but you will feel it when it passes you
And this is by far not the fastest ferrari
Porsche!!!
Lamborghini sounds better
Porsche Turbo S:  Built to win drag races Lambo Aventador:  Built to put up a valiant fight Ferrari 812:  Built to look and sound amazing in defeat
SVJ
SVJ
The Porsche is basically a sleeper if you’re comparing exhaust notes...
If the Turbo S destroys them i dont wanna know what the Gt2rs will do.
I'll take the daily driven, cargo space having, 4-seater, 4 wheel driven .... Soft spoken, big stick carrying 911 992 Turbo S-mack down Porsche!
i like the sound of the porsche!
Porsche is like a black mamba hissing it's way beating the bull and the horse
Only a bore buys a Porsche.
Carwow we want see Drage Race Bugatti veyron vs Porsche 911 turbo S
That roulette tattoo is pure 🔥
This is Super fast? gonna have to get rid of that name.
I only noticed on car it was silver, the other two superbly styled pimp transporters never stood a chance.
'strada' this mode is not meant for racing. No shit sherlock💀
The porche is good speed but the look is not that cool the lambo is best at sound,look,and launches the Ferrari is good at gaining onto cars.  In my opinion the lambo is just mine
The turbo s is just built for drag races. AWD with all the weight over the rear axle for great launches as well as the crazy fast pdk transmission
I'd take the 812 if it was a you can only have one car to do it all. 911 is close. Aventador is the type of car you drive to bee seen and not to get where you are going. The Huracan is way more polished. We will see if the big v12 brother gets a better successor. I've never liked 911 headlights. I just don't. LOVE the tech though. A modern slant nose would be amazing! Aventador. Amazing sound but everything else is No thanks. Huracan would be a HUGE thank you yes!  812. Love it. Old school coupe look, V12 and best interior.
Love Porsche
Porche for life always been my dream car
You see that second rematch...was one hell of a drug race 👌😂😂 someone almost went nuts😂😂
911!!!!
HAHAHA! That intro was spot on! Hahaha
The lamborghini avan deltir dert song lo

Lambo looks the best, but the German is the better all rounder
I would love to have the ferrari or lambo
Mclaren 765LT = 9.94s (1/4mile)

Lamborghini aventador svj

Nobody's gonna believe,  tho I knew it's gonna be the porsche
1st : German engineering 2nd : German engineering w/ Italian touch 3rd : Italian engineering
Porsche is a car .... rst are just show toys.. suck ittt
Of course, Ferrari is the best.
The Ferrari, no question that engine is special, and it's the last of it's kind
SVJ
That SVJ isn't slow, Yanny just adds another 200 kilos to the SVJ.
Porsche for weekdays, Ferrari for weekends.
SVJ every day
Lambo and Ferrari 🤦‍♂️🤮 Porsche 🔥🔥
I love the Turbo S. It’s a good deal, a great daily, quiet, less flamboyant and it’s all about business.
The Lamborghini aventador svj is one of my dream cars 😍
Yyy

In the 1st race the Lambo jumpes the start
O would have the Porsche of course.... Half of the prices
That was stunning race! I was screaming here at the end cheering Matt to win but Yani is on a rebel Lambo... From Brazil
Yanni jump started
I would love to buy an Aventador svj
Red Ferrari with beige interior
Porsch i mean its cheaper and better and faster haha
911 - the quiet kid in the back of the class but gets everything 100% SVJ - The loudest kid in class thats getting everyone's attentions 812 - The 2nd loudest in class but not alpha enough
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Porsche 911 turbo s

Porsche!
Lamb
Not only is the Porsche faster, it looks way better than the other two. The other two look like what I drew as a kindergartener.
Aventador clearly won the sound test 🥰🥰🥰
The Lambo sounded the best !
Ferrari

Après l’émission de ARTE sur les énergies VERTES !  Je me pose la question suivante : en Amérique du sud l’exploitation des métaux rares ont pour effet que la terre fertile d’avant devient une terre incultivable après pour les pauvres paysans ! Qui n’ont plus rien ! Que je sache les terres dont ont a extrait le pétrole ! Sont toujours cultivable où pas ? Elles sont même meilleures après qu’avant partout dans le monde ! Idem au fond des océans…lors d’éruptions volcaniques au fond des océans le pétrole nourrit même le plancton origine de toute vie terrestre ! Les batteries de Elon Musk finiront par empoisonner la terre entière d’ici 10 où 20 ans !

THE SVJ has the best sound.IT IS THE KING OF THE ROAD!!!!!!!!!!!
Porsche is the legend
U know it has to be the 911
Well, I hope that one day I could buy a Porsche before I die, before this drag I thought I would buy it because it's the "kind of" most affordable, but Now I'm really glad that it's better than the others, So let's hope that I can miraclly own a Porsche one day
Porsche forever!

Porsche is and will remain Porsche ... the sports car of all sports cars...❤️❤️❤️👏👍

Lamborghini All day Everyday 💚❤️😍🥰😘
The svj is magnificent
Between 812 and svj, ferrari without doubts.... But my vote goes to porsche, that car is a fucking beast...
I wish Yianni was more enthusiastic...
Yanni jumped the start on the first race
I'm late to the party but I would take the Porsche 911 turbo s over any of the vehicles. Especially when it comes to price compared to what it can do. May not sound the best, but it sure seemed to out accelerate against larger engines with more horsepower. Ill take the torque too.
U dont launch it with a manual shifting. The automatic is way faster
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👌
Nothing can beat LAMBORGHINIS in sound and think if there was LAMBORGHINI HURACAN in the race.....❣
farrari
Porsche won because of the rear engine placement...gave it a good launch ypu can notice this on the roll race...if all the cars were rear engined I don't think it would have been first
I would want a porsh
Porsche unterschätzt man immer voll
Lamborghini jumped hard
Lamborghini svj sounded better , and my favorite car
ok the lambo sounded the best but my favorite car won of all...THE PORSCHE
Porsche = power to weight ratio
Lambo
Lamborghini new my opinion
I don't cair if mony dosnt exist i would still go for the porch i watched this vidio for the porch
Ferrari
812 superfast is not super fast
In my country there is a said : THERE ARE ONLY TWO CARS IN THIS WORLD , German cars and bad cars.

I have Lamborghini Aventador roadster
Porsche
porche
Matt funny accents...lol
lamborghini svj my dream car
That’s kinda weird a porche is faster 🤯🥴
I love the sound of a minty lambo
I'd take the Lambo, and sell it just to buy the Porsche..
The Porsche is a suppressed HK 45.
Porsche all day! Every Day!!!
Lamborghini will only win yes
Ok
Worst video  in the world rn
The Porsche was so far ahead that the real race was for 2nd place 😂
Again, never judge a book by its cover. Porsche is king.
Porsche💪🇩🇪
Lamborghini were so close to the crown
Svj all day, everyday long........
Lamborghini sounded best
I hope  your car is  Fast
nissan gtr vs lamborghini aventador s
Porsche =1
Ferrari
W la figa
911 turbo sd
Porshe is the quietest but its the quickest
DO LEARN HOW TO PRONOUNCE PORSCHE FFS!!! 🙄😡😡😡😡 You're meant to be "professional" broadcasters!!!!
In the proper pronunciation, “Porsche” is actually a two-syllable word. So it is really pronounced like “Por-shuh.”
Porsche 911 Turbos S
Might as well use the 911 as a camera man for every drag race
Do a whole video with an Italian accent
Porsche wins with far less power. Porsche are legendary engineers
What grown up is concerned with the sound coming out of the tail pipes???? that was a teenage thing
No adult would own that Lambo
911 is king....always
911 Turbo S. All day, every day.
Porsche is like sir this is a Wendy's
Lambo all day, every day!
Porsche all day
lamborghini and ferrari are tough competetors but porshe looks cute and is (asilentkiller) like down below if yall agree
all sport and why not the 812 SUPERFAST?
Porche 100%
Lamborghini SVJ my favorite car and it was the loudest
I would own the Porsche, but I would love to drive the Ferrari once.
lambo
Why is it not an rs2 911?😁
Man i am a BMW'S fan but that Porsche is nuts its the best
I want the superfast
"he never let anyone else drive his cars" minute later hes redlining doughnuts in it.. 🤦🏽‍♂️

Lamborghini
Earring dude always jumps the calls; replace him, unfair character.
Overall I would get the Porsche, but from design, I pick the aventador but in a different color
PORCHE TO THE VICTORY
The 812 SF is a GT, how its supposed to be lighter than the Lambo ...
The Porsche is a speed demon
Lambo for all
Lol, 812 Superfast is not that ,,superfast” as Ferrari says🤯
Porsche
Lamborghini best looking car
We love to see you do some of your videos in both we Americans do pounds and miles per hour maybe you can include that in so we don’t have to figure it out
Porsche was the best sounding car
I’d go for Porsche anytime. German automobiles forever
Do a drag race against Ferrari F8 Tributo vs Ferrari SF90 stradale vs Ferrari 488 Pista vs Ferrari 812 Superfast
The 812 is not a supercar it is a god damn gt
I think this one suits “Its not about the car, its about who’s behind the wheels”
=SMMEER  ALDAEDEH
Yhanni talking smack about the ferrari when the ferrari smokes the porshe and the lambo
That brown guy is so cringy
Yanni def jumped the first drag lmao..  But glad the Porsche did that well!!
Porsche best value and quickest and the only one you would feel safe leaving outside Tesco!
For me the best sound is the ferarri ..but the best car is porsche :))
I would have the Lambo, but have to admit the Porsche is an epic peace of engineering!
It’s obviously the Porsche
Porsche Cuz... Lmao you know why.. do i rlly need to explain it XD
Porsche be like m i joke to u. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Have you heard of the phrase “Empty vessels make the most noise”?  *Poor Lambo*
Türk yokmu Türk 💪💪💪💪🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
lambo
I'm not a fan of Porsche, but my god does that thing out perform "super cars"   My jaw is hitting the floor with amazement.   Cracking channel though
I don't know much about cars so can someone please explain how Porsche gets 650hp from a 6cyl while the Lamborghini only has 770 from a 12 cyl?

Mad respect to the Porsche peek engineering however, the Ferrari is the proper super car here.
porsche is on his own LEAGUE LOL
Lambo! All day
I would take the Porsche turbo
F8 TRIBUTO
For the looks I would go for the ferrari BUT if I had to pick for speed porse all the way.
Better then tesla videos
3...2...1 GO  Porsche: Guten Tag
Thats not fair lol single clutch in a rolling race.. come on man lol
Lambo sounds better!
I don't understand what does it mean a drag race 1/4 miles between a 2-wheel drive and a 4-wheel drive
I love lamborghinis
Italy vs germany
Billionaire: I never let ppl drive my car.  Mechanics thinking about all the sideway donuts they done: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
The single clutch is killing the lambo
Lamborghini
I personnaly think the 812 is sounding WAYYY better than both others in this video.. you have to hear it in real life though.
This is germany baby ;)
I’d take the Porsche for performance and the lambo or Ferrari for the lady’s
No lie I love the ferrari
Who the hell can dislike this video?!!!! Which other car channel on YouTube has been able to face the 992 Turbo S with these and other super cars?!!! I bet those dislikes are from fanboys from other car channels
Porsche :I rule😉😉😉
Bugatti vs Lamborghini drag race
Porsche.
SVJ looked the best
Ciao bella
Matt jumped the start in the ferrari in the second run. He moves before her hands start to drop. The Ferrari cheated!!! watch in 0.25x speed at 7:49
Turbo S.
Ferrari
Porsche
I think the beauty of the Lambo in comparison with Porsche is way more preferable than 0,2 sec difference in 400m!!! What do u people think?
Lamborghini svj
Porshe is the best
Obviously the aventador s John is the best
SVJ
I’d get the Porsche with an exhaust system on it 🤷‍♂️
SVJ 100%
Want the Porsche  Ferrari looks the best tho. Not really close
Porsche sounds best
Ferrari 812, love your videos with yanni <3
Porsche all day everyday
Porsce
The Lambo and Ferrari are like two Italian mobsters shooting tommy guns at each other. The Porsche is like a ninja... silently killing them both.
Porsche for sure!
porsche power⚡
Binod
Love the fact the Porsche at £100,000 cheaper than the Ferrari and £200,000 cheaper than the Lamborghini spanks the lot of them with that automatic gearbox. It doesn’t have the supercar looks granted but it is the best supercar money can buy. You can also use that Porker as your daily driver and it doesn’t shriek ‘new money’ like the Lambo.
That Lamborghini is a mentalist
I would have the lamborghini
I'd get the Turbo.
Lamborghini ANYDAY, EVERYDAY!!!😂😂😂
Very intrested to see lambo sesto elemnto againt svj and huracan
Porsche!!!
I would have the SVJ
Svj
I'd have the Ferrari!
I always love 911
Porsche is the pure german nothing can get it
Tell yanni that he need to keep his eyes on the road not to look at the sides or back
SVJ
Lamborghini's furt was louder
Lambo
I was so down with Lambos lotusses. Look at porche though
I am still a big fan of Ferrari
Porsche is the best but because I’m stupid I’m gonna take the lamborghini because it makes you feel special, but it’s my opinion
Porsche is the best by far 🔥🔥🔥
Porsche been doing it for years
Lambooo
Ferrari sounds best
Porche for life and benz
Silent kid won
I have a 2014 911 turbo S  still beating out opponent  Porsche the King ！
Made in Germany
I take the Porsche all day, every day!

Porsche, always.
I love the way Mat talks at the start lol 😂🤣
Lambo: sounds the best Ferrari: looks the best Porsche: is the best
Who said Ferrari only looks good in red. That black is epic
That Porsche used a 6 cylinder to redeem its drivers poor reaction time against v12’s supercars! That’s next level brilliance!
812's lines so damn smooth bro
812 Superfast DEFINITELY!!!!   Ferrari Baby!!!
the year is 2030, mat wattson has just been cancelled on twitter for being a racist nazi, they used the accents in this video as evidence of him being problematic.
A true car enthusiast ie not about “automotive fashion”, would have to take the Porsche. Unless of course he would take the Ferrari or Lamborghini, sell them and then buy the Porsche and walk away with some substantial gas money!
Porsche ❤️
Lamborghini aventdor svj
No car in the world can put power down better than porsches....that rear engine weight just pushes the tires down do hard and gets the perfect grip.....wow
Never judge a car by the way it sounds...or make no sound at all - Porsche

When are you and yanni gonna race each other in same cars over certain events

Avendor won the noises
I think Lamborghini has done as much as they can with N/A. Time to turbo and blow everyone away.
The Ferrari is the best
Wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Super fast more like super slow
Lamborghini cheated off the line!
Why you dont measure how far the cars can go before stopping during the breaks test?.
ferrai
Porsche all day long
Porsche got the best sound ever
Ferrari wins

The only car to beat the 2020 Porsche 911 Turbo S is a superbike.
How do you say Porsche in youtube?
Ferrari 100%
SI MA, IL PILOTA DELLA FERRATI DOVE 'HANNO PRESO? IN UN CAMPO DI PATATE🤣?
I would go porsche,  but the cabriolet instead of the coupe
Porsche Porsche Porsche...all the way. The SVJ is a posers car.
I saw a red Lambo Aventador at a dealership and to me that is not a car, is a work of art!!! So beautiful! If I could only have one of those?! It would be the 911 without a doubt,  what a machine!
It‘s make me sad that the Porsche has an bad sound because of the reglements
lamborghini
Lamborghini
Porsche 👍
I love the Porsche as it is understated...the others are too flash....
Money no object id have the 911. If I was paying I'd have the 911.  I'd use it every day & not worry about it breaking or being uncomfortable.
Ferrari is Ferrari and Lamborghini is Lamborghini and porshe is shit
Which Car i would have? 1st Porsche 911 Turbo S, 2nd Lamborghini Aventador SVJ and 3rd  Ferrari 488 GTO

Said it once and I will say it again. Porsche is king of the road. You can modify with 1000 bhp but that’s tuned!
Porsche Porsche Porsche ❤️ Get your Italian toys to a mechanic after this race to check if they still work properly
A ferrari
definately not a farrari😂
Do a race against a Porsche vs a Bugatti
Do a drag race agenst the porches vs BMW m 5
Ferrari
I take the 911 over anything
Porsche for sho
7:13, lambo is misfiring quite a lot
911 turbo S For smokin
Lambo nya byk gaya lo anjimm.
Porsche 911
Porsche made me respect 6 cylinder engines. I bought the Cayman S (I know, not a 911) and it surprised the hell out of me what an NA 6 cyl can do. Went out day 2 of owning it and some Camaro SS driver saw me and tried to do a ricer fly by throwing the deuces up. I floored it, caught up, and left him at 140 mph. It instantly gained my respect for a 325 hp engine to take a 455 hp LT1. That's superior engineering; more with less.
911!!!!!!!!
Porsche 911 Turbo S  is little bit uglier than others, but it is the best
Porsche got smaller engine, less Hp but more torque then the other 2? And being THAT much faster being SO MUCH cheeper? Hell man, Germans really know how to be efficient, it scares me.
Lamborghini still sound better.... But I Love the PORSCHE
ferrari still sound better.. but i love porsche  skip that lambo lol xD justkidding
How are these cars no match for the porsche. Porsche really knows what they are doing!
honestly best looking car is the porsche 911
porsche is a silent killer
Lamborghini
5:04 that actually sounds like a beat
Lamborghini the loudest and the strongest Ferrari nice too but not quite
SVJ ...VERY BAAAD
Since a baby Porsche has been my favorite
🤣🤣🤣
Is it just me that thinks that a 360k pound car should obligatory have a dual clutch? I mean, robotized manual? On a 360k pound car from 2018? That is just unnaceptable. You can clearly see that it looses sooooo much time on gear shifts.
Lamborghini 😍hands down
Lol the Porsche sounds nothing... Winner is SVJ
Instant Thumbs up as soon as I saw Yanni 😅😅... Fun and Funny guys. Love 'em
812 superfast
The Lambo, just look at it!
Todos estos sonidos de coches, que son música para oídos... Desaparecerá en poco tiempo.
Porscha
Porsche
Yianny jumped
Ferrari for yes baby Love urgent video mat watson
Drag king porsche
Porsche
Definitely a Lamborghini Aventador SVJ mate.
mind image line please !
I whould have gone with  ferrari 812 superfast
This just showed me that lap times mean nothing!! Forza Italia 🇮🇹
812 super fast  all the way
Porsche
THE MOST WILDEST IS THE PORSCHE. ALWAYSSSSSSS GRETTINGS FROM BARCELONA.
Just straight pipe the Porsche
loud sounds should be bad because it means excess sound energy is being lost when it could be converted into kinetic energy. More specifically it could be of two cases: First is that the thermodynamic cycle of the engine is at a very low efficiency so a lot of the input heat gets converted to excessive output heat instead of useful work/kinetic energy. This is typically due to the max and min temps of the otto cycle being too close together and the compression ratio being too small as well. Another case is that the gases are expelled out of the cylinders when the internal combustion has not reached termination. This is also why you sometimes see flames coming out of the exhausts of lambos. It's actually a very bad thing meaning the energy of the combustion did not go towards producing work for the piston but instead is used to produce sound waves and flames from the exhausts. A typical solution for this is to simply add a turbo. This is why the fastest cars in the world (Bugattis, Hennesseys, SSC Tuatara, or even koenigseggs, etc etc) aren't actually that loud partially due to a lot of sound energy being absorbed by turbos which in turn gets (indirectly) converted to more useful work
The friary has a better rev
Porsche 911 is my favorite car🤩🤩
I’d get the Porsche
I would definitely take the Porsche 911 turbo S because it's beautiful and fast
No doubt I'd have the Lambo.......in a different color.
Beetle beats horse and bull, wow!
Matt watsons personality is so much better than Yannies, he’s just a humble funny guy. Yan comes across as a flashy muggy wan*er that would fly pass at 120mph on a motorway thinking his the Don 🙄 oh look at me and my bleached teeth and my lambo ⬅️✊🏻➡️
He never let anyone drive his car and yani goes on to do donuts 😂😂😂
Svj
Lambo
Ferrari is the best🔝🔥❤️
The Lambo is the best looking!!! The Ferrari is the best sounding!!! But that Porsche is just the BEST!!! I'll take the 911 Turbo S please 😊👍
Lambo
Why the SVJ???? The 812 is the normal version. SVJ is the ultimate Aventador. Unfair race.
porche
Porsche the silent killer
Matt and Yanni forgot that there was a Porsche on the other side
Porsche fast but boring and too many around.
Porsche is king bro
Porsche is the best! Quite boi.
the tesla sounded the best
Your car sounded the best
Ferrari everyday any day
Porsche is more fast and cheap than Lamborghini and Ferrari 812. But Ferrari F8 Tributo is the fastest one!!!
Porsche has always been my dream car
I think the best one was the lambogini
Porsche is porsche
i’ll still take that lambo still tho anyday
Ferrari
You need to do aventador vs aventador s vs aventador sv vs aventador svj
How crash the V12 of the Lambo, watch vid
Turbo S all the way!
Svj sound 🔥
Ferrari
Best Looking Car is Undoubtedly The SVJ...  But The Porsche IS THE BEST CAR in every other way.. Price, Reliability, Durability...
Still choose the svj or 812 over the turbo s
Porsche 1/2 to 1/3 of the price, it’s also 100 times more reliable... It’s unbelievable performance with  just 6 cyc...
This is why Porsche is the best car maker in the world ! Cost less than half and still whooped the Lambo
I’ll take the 911 all day
Porsche is Porsche. And I love this car. Car, that has a soul.
Bull
Porsche is it man , without a doubt🤟
The Porsche is just a masterpiece of german engineering
The Porsche is the only car of these I want to get. I don't like the lambo and the ferrari. In my opinion there is no point in buy anything else than the Porsche!
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ: An awesome rare,beautiful car that spits flames from it's exhaust and has a great sound! Ferrari 812 Superfast: An overpowered Ferrari which sound like a cat that is screaming but has excellent speed and acceleration(sorry if I typed it wrong)but doesn't have very good looks. Porsche 911 Turbo S: A classic car with classic looks that somehow beat the other cars at the drag race and the brake test with have the cylinders,650 horsepower and almost have the price.Maybe it's the car God designed
Porsche: *The silent killer*
Porsche has 19 wins at Le Mans, the most out of any car manufacturer. Porsches aren't made for quarter mile drag races. Put those 3 cars on a track.........that Porsche would embarrass that Ferrari and Lambo.
100% Porsche it’s cheaper and faster and my favourite brand is Porsche
I'd have a Nissan Bluebird ZX Turbo in white with those faded stripes down the sides.
812 super fast
I think the FARRAI 812 SUPER FAST
Ролик -  гавно, вкратце -  дедушка Фердинанд без надрыва и истерики лучше всех (и в разгоне и в торможении). Не тратьте 13 минут жизни- съёмки отвратительные, участники шутят плоско.
Porsche is best
I am freaking impressed by the Porsche
911 turbo s for sure!!!
Who care this ugly Porsche, no Sound, no emotion, nothing.  Italian cars kill them all.
the sound of that svj and super fast went there neck and neck tho
Me porche is better than lambo people in my class is u crazy
Porsche everyday
Today Americans vote. You can watch our coverage tonight of the election results.   Who will win the Presidency?
ferrari is the best
the horse
Svj is the best Matthew
Porsche has so many variations of cars that all look the same I can’t keep up..
Porsche. Seems to win most of the time. I'll start saving, should have enough in twenty or thirty years. Ha
That Porsche just won from 2 v12 cars
Nothing like German engineering.
Ferrari forever
To be fair that Lamborghini is carrying some extra chunk in the drivers seat.
812 is the best
SVJ
Porsche definitely sounded the best!!
SVJ
Might be my fav drag race ever... Better than Tesla drag races lol
Own a turbo s first. Then buy an 812.
Porsche sounded the best 🤟
Wow Porsche....  just a name of power, reliability, performance, safety and standards. That is Porsche. German cars are the best of best in the world. Because German automobile industry is the mother of all the rest of the world automobiles.... Just believe that
lambo
Ferrari
Yianni is an Olympic shifter do you get it
Yanni’s lambo sounded like a beat while drifting
I rather the porche, then the 812 superfast
they laughing because its quiet LMAO
when i was kid i love porsche then i didn't fail its a beast HAHAHA its simple but it runs like a hell
Lamborghini aventador svj
What do you guys think
I think the  Lamborghini won 🏆
Svj
Yanni cheated in the first race
Porsche,  of course!...
The Ferrari and the Lamborghini
I would have the Porsche 911 Turbo S money no object.
Lamborghini svj
Porsche 911 for me yes
Lamborghini
Porsche anyday
Can we all take a moment to respect that "quiet" Porsche.
7:05😂😂
That's ferrari is insane,I love that.my heart wanna first the Ferrari,in second place lambo and in last the Porsche but my mind said to me pike the 911 and then the others two.it is absolutely bonkers
Ferrari
Lamborghini
Ferrari
Porche or Ferrari
I'll get the Porsche
Porsche
hands down the ferrari looks better. But the porshe is simply better than both italians
Porsche is like... I work with children 😂😂.  Why am even racing .
Lamborghini aventador svj is a BEAST
F12
Ferrari
SO easy svj
Porsche 911 is the greatest car ever made in any iteration.
Porsche all day long!
the Porsche is that one asian kids who tell you that he didn't study for the test but still got a high grade
For me it’s definitely the Lambo. It sounds great like a Roaring Lion and looks stunning .  But the sound man , the SOUND !!!
Ferrari !
Mat Watson  it
All about the porsche life baby
ferrari all day
Yianni’s expression is really amazing😂
ferrari
Guys i dont know what a Porsch is???!! Its called fucking PORSCHE!!!!
ferrari
I'd have the Porsche, Ferrari, then Lamborghini
The smartest decision, the SVJ will be a car that will be revalued more than the other two, due to the new electric motors, they are no longer competition in terms of gasoline engines, you only have the status, look and the limited edition
svj killed
911
The best race on car wow so far❤️
I'd take the porsche, It's the fastest and makes the least noise!  Porsche is just the best
👍
The Lambo SVJ beated a 911 GT2 Rs at the Nurburgring. In Europe we do not quarter mile a car to evaluate its performance but we just bring it to lap in a circuit.
Porsche
Id’d honestly go with the Porsche. A) it’s the cheapest p, b) it’s the fastest, c) it has the best brakes.
I would like to buy lamborgene svj.
that porsh is a beast doesn't look the role...but but against those V12s  it just dusted them of its side view mirror...or shoulder....i wonder on track who would win
I love watching Yianni doing drag races he is hilarious AF!
PORSCHE
Lamborghini
I love porsches but when they rev they sound like blowdryers
PORSCHE:  Stuttgart Pride !!!!
SVJ
The reason the 812 lost the drag race is simply that it’s 2 wheel drive
maybe don't race in automatic
Ferrari 812 100% man doesn't look like a kids car like the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, even tho it looks good too.
Yea Porsche! And most reliable too. I daily mine, 0 issue
Lamborghini
Lambo
Yannie´s Passion is so deep for the lambo. Love it
Love you accents  mat.
tenetevi la porsche e lasciate le ferrari a e lamborghini ad altri, vi consiglio di comprarvi solo porsche e macchine inglesi, non usate ferrari e lamborghini
I would have the Turbo S in black
The accents were hilarious!
Porsche is faster,  better brakes and cheaper.
The Porsche revving got me dying🤣
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Ferrari
ferrari & porsche all day 🔥🔥
How did the Porsche lose the final rolling race??
The Porsche sounds definitely the best:)
the fricking ferrari it´s much better that the shit called lamborghini #CavallinoRampanteTeam
Love the accents Mat keep doing them😂😂😂😂
Ferrari ❤️
La pronuncia!!
I would take all three
I want that porsche
I’m taking the Lamborghini SVJ I’ve always loved that car and I would like to buy one in the future
Lambo:sounds the best Ferrari:looks the best Porsche:is the best
I'm not patriotic, but German cars are the best
Lambo sounds the best
SVJ
The ferrari overall is faster than the lambo, the only reason it lost in the first race is because it is RWD and the porsche and labo are AWD, because at the rolling start the ferrari straight away OBLITTERATED the lambo
Lambos and Ferrari have to much issues so you know what I'm going for porche
i wouldve lambhorini aventador SVJ
what is inside that V6?
Ill take the farari
I would like to have the ferarri cause its cool looking
Ama go with italian Ferrari
Lambo and Ferrari are the two bullys that bully the german porsche
Porche 911
Ferrari is best looking
I love the 911
I was surprised how well the 911 really contented
Porsche
I would take that 812 Superfast outta the 3.. In a heartbeat.!!!!!! 812 SF is gorgeous 😍❤
I love Ferrari, but the 911... man! Best bang for you bucks, isn’t it?
Aventador couse it is insanely loud and fast it is OP
Porsche = poor mans super car
GERMAN ENGENIERING !
Porsche low key killing it
Lamborghini   Aventador
Lamborghini man
You’re car
Bruh Porsche got the skills bro.
Lambo
So the best sounding car has 6.5 N/A V12.
The  porsh is bad
I am still suprised about fast that 911 is.
Either Porsche or Ferrari, the Ferrari does look better, much better but the Porsche is cheaper and faster
lamboregini svj
The 911 is for me
Ferrari is the best loking
Porsche the silent KILLER 💪
I love how Yianni just focused on Mat because he already knew the Porsche is gonna win
7:00 thank me later
If you wanna brag, get a ferrari.. If you want the looks (and to brag ofc) get the lambo If you want the actual performance, meanwhile keeping the extra money in your pocket... Do the sensible thing.. Get a porsche!
The Porsche is like that kid in your math class who is smart without even trying
I will choose Porsche any time!!!
l0l Mat! Your accents were hilarious! Hahahhaha
pause at 5.26
Ferrari : best looking Ferrari:best sound
I prefer the Porsche <3
ferrari 812
Porsche
Of course the porsche will win awd and way more low down torque but sound awful. You are clearly trading performance for sound. Rather be a little slower in a useless drag race and have a n/a v12 reving to 9k
If I got it for free I would take the Ferrari if I had to pay for it I would go for the Porsche as it’s do damn impressive and good looking for the price
😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
Svj
I'd go for the Lambo SVJ
And ik I’m late
Looks the best
BLACK FERRARI
And the sportbike thinks..... hold my beer....
Ferrari    sounds  tge  bestt   in  this  video
5:20
porsche
Porsche all the way, ...... :)
From second 0:00 to 0:11 don't joke on italian language ( I'm italian)
4:01, How I react when a supercar drives past me.
Folks I think Porsche will show this clip to prospective buyers who may be thinking of buying a Ferrari or Lambo instead. Much lower price and it smokes them.
Porsche💪🏻
The porsche 911 turbo s all day long
Ferrari ❤ 💥
I'd pick Lamborghini Aventador SVJ or The Ferrari 812 Superfast.
This has to be the noisiest race
Nobody talks about the fact that Yanni false started the first Race
Ferrari : good at high school and good at revving class  Lamborghini : the best at high school and great at revving school  Porsche : the quietest kid in high school
12:13 I'll take the Porsche it's mental !
That Porsche, with a 6 cilinder😳, think ferrari and lambo need to get back to the drawing table🥴
Id take Ferrari
Definitely the Lamborghini aventador svj sounds way better but don't judge a book by its cover even though that Porsche is quite,the Porsche gained magical powers from nowhere to take first place really impressed
Drive it till there to warm up tires 🤣 yanni
Yanni 😂 when the turbo s rev
SVJ
eyes say lambo brain says ferrari heart says porsche  wallet says 1998 nissan micra
Never underestimate a Porsche
Lambo
The fact that Porsche was the fastest was because most of its energy was going to the car's kinetic energy store rather than lot of its energy being wasted behind the sound and thermal!
7:21  The race: * intensifies * Meanwhile porsche: umm chille anyways so
This is why the true wealthy people buy Porsche, because it doesn’t draw a lot of attention from other people and you can still drive it as a normal car. If you want to show off your lottery money, buy a Ferrari or Lamborghini.
Porsche: dont reach young bloodz
Always Porsche. Ferari and Lamborghini are for idiots.
I would have the Porsche any day
Ha the pig beat the bull and the horse 😂
I  LOVE LAMBORGHINI SO MUCH !!!!!
When I grow up I want to have Lamborghini
Yiani and Matt are rivals
give me the ferrari for the weekends and the porsche for the week
ferrari 812 superfast
Yanni cheated lol
You can get a 2014 turbo s for 95k now still does 0-60 in 2.7
damn, this ferrari is beautiful
I vote for the Porsche
huligan)
Porsche 🏆💪
I would have the Ferrari
When Matt was speaking German I thought i was watching German carwow
I'm just excited and interested in SVJ and 812 battle, the Porsch? Not so much.
I sometime come back to this video just because of the intro
Ferrari 😎
4:58 sounds too good 😂🎶 idc what kind of cars you’re into, an Aventador’s V12 will always put a smile on your face 😂
Ferrari
F12 forsure
lambo
I would like having the Ferrari
Porsche 911 turbo S
I would take the porsche
The Lamborghini the Porsche is fast but it sounds soft
Lambo: sounds the best Ferrari: looks the best Porche: is the best
Lamborghini sounds the best
SVJ

Porsche
First the lambo but after the race for sure the Porsche
come on lambo lets beat  the ferrari hahaha 12:56
The Porsche was so far ahead that the real race was for 2nd place 😂
Lamborghini Avendator Svj
The Ferrari would’ve won if it was red
whoooo drives some cars like these one in automatic mode that’s a shame !!!!!!!!!
In a perfect world... All 3
The svj took the win. When it hits rev limiter its beautiful
But my choice? Hmmm. Gotta love the Lambo. I dunno tho.
Ferraris are beautiful but the way they treat people and their snotty ass attitude is a major turn off. Also the way they manipulate journalism about them. Fuckers.  That Lambo is amazing.  But Porsche, God almighty they are stupid fast. Anyone who's ever driven ANY 911 knows they are faster than they may seem.  Also Ferraris love throwing cautions and going into limp mode and setting themselves aflame.
Porsche. Easy.
i want lambo svj its my favourite supercar
Ferrari but a much better color.
Svj
I can't stand Ferrari as a company, wouldn't own one if I could. Porsche on the other hand...
Porsche Lowkey is loud as hell
Little bit late, but i prefer the Porsche
Top end ferrari is the fastest even though it's the heaviest
Mat:hooligan  Also mat: typical
Lombo sound nice too
FERRARI IS THE BEST 😇🥰😍😍🤩
The svj
If not a Maserati, then Ferrari all the way
Not gonna lie I’d have the 813
Love how the lambo is slower and double the price of the  911 but i would still choose it out of any of those cars
best is ferrari 812 superfast carwow
Porsche its a silent killer...
Porsche is SERIOUSLY underrated gimme a Porsche all day long over a shit lambo and ferrari and id even rather have an RS Audi over a lambo and Ferrari 🤣
Porsche forever
Ngl that 812 is damn sexy
SVJ is the SICKEST CAR EVER
i will buy svj and ill sell it to earn some money😁
Porsche 911 turbo s
Doug Demuro: Everyone says Porsche costs heavier but in fact, it is better.
opens the ferrari door with your foot haha
Tesla would still probably destroy them all.
Horse grilled the bull
812 for lifeeee
Porschemobbing
Stop. Saying. PORSCH. it's PorschE. Like Porsch-uh. Please.
Porsche
Half video begging for like and subscribe,, I make it never 🖕
After this I’ma get a Porsche 911 turbo s
Deutsche Wertarbeit, Jungs Porsche ist halt Chef
Try Bugatti
5:04 Honda drivers leaving a car meet
That’s Turbo S  smh
Frarri  and Lamborghini
Love the accent 😀
This weren’t silly accsent, they were terrible     Haha gg, nice drag race you eren’t yourself another sub
Ferrari is the best
lamborghini
Porsche and Ferrari they're great brilliant cars but I would still pick the lambo even if it had lost all the races
SVJ
200.000£ for better sound? For sure!
I would rather have a Ferrari
ferari  pabeda
I haven't seen who wins yet, but Ill take the Porche for it's beauty alone.
Svj because of resale  👀👀👀
Ford gt plz
I'd go for the Horse 🐎   Where are those rari fans?😁
Ferrari 812 Superfast for me, no doubt about it. Looks the best, sounds the best and is the best.
Ferrari looks the best. Lamborghini sounds the best. But I would without a doubt pick the Porsche and not cause it's the fastest. But simply because it's the Best. Cheers‼️
Olai https://share.nextcash.co/register.php?referral=Reims999
Forget the Porsch... go for posh! Lambo for fun! Ferrari for ever!
Gay
This person reminds me of Ken Miles, R.I.P
Porsche damals wie heute #1
Lol at the Italians. 🤣 German FTW! 💪
Money was no object .... SVJ, 911 Turbo S, 812. 812 sounds the best, SVJ close 2nd, 911 too quiet. Straight Pipe them all and let's hear them again. Savage Garage had Gintani straight pipe their SVJ and it sounds Incredible, Very F1 scream, almost sounds like a Murci.
No one gonna mention how badly the lambo guy jumped the start of the first run? In a proper drag race he would be disqualified...
The Porche sounds the best looks the best and... I don't need to say more😀❤️🔥Bust just one last thing the two other cars just sounds like teenagers with 125 cc bikes with loud pipes. Or like grown up people riding a bike and feels the need to rew it all the time 😂😀
the ferrari is the best sounding looking and most practical
The 812 better
Porsche man that thing is beautiful
The porsche is the best in my mind but get a viper in there
Adventedor
None of these cars are my favorite versions of they corresponding brands but if forced to pick one... I would take the Porsche 911 Turbo S.
I'm Italian but, I would choose the Porche. Love Porche.
Litarlly no one  Yanee kill the ferreri though😂
I’d have the Ferrari. No question about it. Best looking, best noise. Plus Yianni is annoying so can’t have a Lambo.
Por-Ferari
LAMBO ALL DAY EVERYDAY
Ferrari is RWD that s why it lose the drag race
Porsche 911 Turbo S without a doubt. Looks, build, price, performance, practicality. Hands down.
All noise and no go against the Porsche
Paying more than mil to lose to a Porsche NOPE!
That lambo actually cost him 320k he said so on his channel
Ferrari 812 superfast
I'd rather have the Porsche over the two cars
Offcourse Porsche matte
I would have the ferrari
Italians doesn’t talk how you imitate....trust me...I’m Italian 😂
I mean my dad has both haha
Porsche is the masterpiece of the auto industry!
Ferarri 812 of course
Wie die Engländer ''Poosch'' sagen
Swap drivers to see if the weight difference changes the outcome in either car.
thaaat porsche on warm tires =))))) maaad gap
Definitely would go for Porsche because Kids like brand (Ferrari) Adults like looks ( Lamborghini) Legends like speed ( Porsche) 😅😅
How is it when thers a 1000hp supra for drag with these ????
Remember, Porsche is the best on turns. Drag rece is not your best, and he wins.
Mk4 supra vs r34 skyline vs rx7
Lamborghini Aventador anyday and everyday 👍no matter what... Best by looks , performance and standards
Germany 1 Italy 0
you wouldn't think something with 650hp that weighs 1600kg could be that fast
Great accents Mat!
I would have the Porsche 911 turbo s
The Lamborghini won the sound battle. The Ferrari looks sexier. The Porsche is just very effective.
Can you guys try the dodge challenger demon?
the svj
Jesus is coming
I love u r race
The Lamborghini sounds better than all of those cars
lets goooooo porsche
i would have the porshe 911 turbo s
Nfs in real life be like
I would take svj 🔥❤️
The push sounds the best
Lamborghini aventador svj
Porsche is King 💪
Porsche all day along
PORCHE IS THE NERD THAT KNOWS BJJ AND LOW KEY WILL TAP EVERYONE IN CLASS.
my dream car is a lamborghini huracan performante
Not a big lambo guy ngl so I’ll have to stick with the Porsche. I love them but I also love Ferrari.
992 Turbo for sure
We all know that you pick a bad Porche because you are scare of that car, is the best car in the world.
The porch is amazing
A porch is my dream car
Porsche: weight on back wheels make me go whooooosh
Overall, Porsche is best...agility, speed, gas efficiency, braking, reliability and price!! ...love the sound of the little guy. The other 2 is just for looks :P....Just a couple of Sunday laps, the Ferrari already got problems.
Italians are like that Gorgeous striper whole lotta baggage and problems. Porsche is The Girl you marry.
Turbo S any day of the week. A mild software update, and the italians would be totally demolished. 😄  I'm surprised there were no issues with more than three launch control starts in a row with the two South Europeans...  😉  And it's still Porsche, not porch...
Marry the Porsche. kill the Lamborghini. F*** the Ferrari.
Where does Lambo do there R&D  ? Ferrari F1 ..Lamborghini?
i'll take for me the f1 sounding 812
The Porsche 911 Turbo S destroys Supercars that have more power 🔥! Just love that car ❤️!
Hahaha.. if you need some lessons of italo-english I'm here.. An Italian cars lover hearing Ferarri and Lamboghinni can have an hearth attack  :-) But 992 TS is a f***ing animal
Lambo’s design is beautiful, but 911 is a weapon not a toy.
1 wanna have the porche
Porsche brakes are known for quick speeds and good brakes 😂
Italian cars 🚗 have there own beauty!  No matter (whether it’s a Porsche, Ferrari or Lamborghini) they all are beautiful. And I love them. :- they don’t have the turbocharged engines , they have the naturally aspirated engine and I love it .
Porsche
porsche
Take the Porsche any day!
"We don't shout our performances, but we will crush them"   That subtle burn
Porsche all day
Just rob someones bughatti and have a race with the Porsche
Those cars have amazing performance. Too bad the driver... does... nothing to make em run. It is like to launch a rocket. The driver is more like a passenger.
Porsche better start ramping up Turbo production....
Lamborghini driver jumped the line on the first drag race
Out of the two I choose the Ferrari but out of three I choose the Porsche
I choose the Ferrari
Get yourself someone who looks at you like Yaani looks at Mat while he's ahead in the race
Best video from carwow
lambo
Porsche fanatic here...love the win!!
Lamborghini svj
The porsche  is the best looking. The lambo is the try hard
Porsche aka the silent killer xD
That squashed VW Bug is pretty quick.
1. Porsche 911 turbo s, 2. Ferarri 812, 3. Lamborghini Aventador SVJ. I personally don't like the looks nor the sounds of the Lamborghini.
the ferrari got faster during the video
yianni borrowes a very expensive lambo and revs it very hard en smokes up the tires lol
SVJ
Lamborghini
Definetly porshe
https://youtu.be/DC-Z5rv3eMA
Mat your tires pressure down!!
812 although much prefer the GTS. Think the Lambo looks terrible with the decals.  The Porsche would be the se sensible choice though.
porsche is best
The porsche and Lambo had a head start.
*“Without Tatra, Porsche as we know it would never have existed.”* (PETROLICIUOS)
Porche
The Lamborghini had the best sound and I would take the Lamborghini or the Ferrari
Can you drag race a Dodge challenger hellcat redeye vs gt500vs camero zl1 1le and put race gas in all of them for top performance
Ferrari is cheaper and faster than the Lambo sooo
The ferrari sound beter
Ferrari any day!
This is what yanni says in almost every drag race when he is in the lead "C, ON"
I like fast cars... but I don't like making cars that terrible noise.
now imagine porsche with 750-800hp tune
The Porsche is the best kind of fart. A silent killer.
Ferrari sounds the best and looks the best
12:01 facts
I'm just amazed by his skills for the accents
Porsche is like beautiful MILF no matter how many blonde there its rich elegant
For looks: Lambo, Porsche, Ferrari....  But Looks per dollar...  Porsche by Far!!    WANT!!!
Ferrari
A normal day for Porsche.
obnoxious personality - moving on
5:22 is that a jump start!?
Today is the first day I ever watched your show.  Love it.  So to pick a car.  If I had to pick a daily driver, porsche hands down.  If I had to pick a weekend cruiser, Ferrari hands down.  and if I had to pick the wacked out attention getting beast, LAMBO for sure !!!!!
The Ferrari is beautiful. But what the heck is wrong with the speedometer? Does it only show steps of 5mph? I would expect a silky smooth movement in a display on cars way cheaper than that.
Lambooooooooooo all day evry day 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
No wonder porsche won , has the most torque and its smaller ...
The aventador
Well that was loud yanni
Are you trying to speak italian because I speak Italian
Frorey is the best
You can throw just any kind of race at the porche and it still beats the hell outta all the others...
What a noise comes from these V12's. Incredible
I was gonna buy a Porsche anyways
Porsche and Ferrari pista
The SVJ had the Nürburgring record for a while not the 812 just saying
Ferrari by far is the more desirable car but would go with the German engineering for longevity and least expensive to service and maintain.
lamborghini
8:20 most of street races made as rollling race, thats why ferrari’s are produced for rolling race as rwd.  it dominates real life race.
Porsche 911
Porsche
why porsche too fast tho
Porsche for sure 😍💪🏼
SVJ
SVJ
The Germans eat the Italians for lunch..
Ferrari 812 all day long, the quickest when moving ❤️
Svj
Guaranteed 99% of the 911 fangirls in the comments would enjoy driving the ferrari or lambo more if they had a day to let them all rip. Fangirls are turning car enthusiasm into a qtr mile obsession.
in reality the speed is not much use, on the road the acceleration is 100x important so welcome PORSCHE
Yes Ferrari! Yes!!
Ferrari
7:16 come on! Oh no!
Ventador sounded better
aventador
since the Lambo and the Ferrari are suuuuuuuper expensive..........   PORSHE  911  TURBO  S
Porsche!!! My dream car. #turboS #gt2rs #gt3rs
Porsche been my favourite since I was 4 yrs old, I'm 30 now and still don't own nor driven one... Yet :(
Pls ferrari 488 vs lambo hurracan and porsche 911 turbo
If you guys get a lamborghini sesto elemento race against the fastest ferrari
lamborghini rules ferrari soso
ferrari
Porsche
Your german accent is actually on point
ferrari everyday
These guys suck the Porsche is a beast!!!!
That Porsche tho🥰🥰
Porsche looks too mundane, styling goes to Superfast.
I'd take the Porsche any day.
Lambo jumped the gun and started before the other two and still lost...
I DON'T HAVE to watch to know Porsche wins.
SVJ is just a dreamcar!!🥺
Ferarrie
I always love Porsche my dad had 718 boxster which is beautiful
12:03 the Ferrari...in red
Porche is like the underestimated anime charector lol
Porsche sounds best
Porsche one love
How the fuck is that porche that fast 🤤
Porsche
Porsche for sure!!!
Who’s the boss?
I can’t hear a sound, F off , the Porsche always win.... yeah!
Porsche then Ferrari then the sh*t Lamborghini should be last
porsh
i would have that ferrarri, porsche is just boring af for boomers, Lamborghini is casual like Mustangs  Ferrarri is just more rare at least for me
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Porsche all day every day
For the money of SVJ i will bay 2 Porshes , one normal and one Cabrio...
COME ON GET FROUGH!
Lamborghini
Porsche for sure! Just another colour
Another case of Porsche brutality
Porsche by miles
Ferrari sounds better then lambo
Yanni started early!!
porsche is the best value for money
race buggati chiron vs ssc tuatara
The lambo makes a lot of noise but not a lot of speed
Lamborghini by miles
Laborgini definitely
Lambo
(Im italian) the “ciao bella” was perfetto
Porsche 🔥
Ferrari
I think you guys making videos for your own promotion  In sprint you and your camera editor never shown Porsche kicking you guys like   2 dogs running behind bone 😂
Yianni is always happy to defeat you  No matter next car saying bye bye   Love to Porsche who kicked your both expensive ass 😂
Anyone think this would be in forza?
the superfast is the better looking car.. just love the look of that back end
Ferrari
lambo
Ok i'm italian WHY YOU SPEAK ENGLISH WITH THIS ACCENT IN ITALY WE DOESN'T SPEAK IN THIS WAY
5:23 if you watch it in super slow motion you can see Yianni jumped the start... didn’t manage to beat the 911 anyway
Please turkish subtitles
Lambo: sounds the best Ferrari: looks the best Porsche: is the best
svj by a mile...
Turbo S because I’d want to drive it daily
Porsche. Any day. EVERY day :)
I feel like the the Porsche is that one camera who didn’t know that there where two “thes” at the beginning of this comment
I like  how the Porsche is so calm
In general Mat seems to play it safe when it comes to keeping traction on
lamborgini svj
drze tą morde jak by w ciąży był..........
Lamborghini
Ferrari
PORSCHE!!!!!!!!!!
This is embarrassing Lamborghini and Ferrari should be ashamed of themselves charging double the price for less performance 😭😭😭😭
Germans: not the loudest, but the best 💪
911
Ay want to see you. With buggati Lamborgini and porch mcclaren new 2020 and toatora new car wich 5 car u his more fast 💨 .?.?.
Porsche
Svj
Lamborghini svj
I would easily take the Turbo S. There are only 1 or 2 cars on the planet that are faster off the line, and the practicality of it by far overshadows the other two... just a shame that it sounds like trash
That Ferrari is just.... it's the first car I've seen in a very long time that I instantly fell in love with.  Theres not 1 thing about it I don't absolutely love.
I want to have a Ferrari
Of course I would have the ( Lamborghini ) it’s the best ( it’s sound is reallly crazy 💪🏼)
812 superfast
Ferrari 812 vs the Ferrari pista. Would love to see the results🤯
911 Turbo S
I would have the Porsche
I love lamborghini but after this performance I am thinking of porsche too as it cheap but the best in all test.
https://youtu.be/R6nfe_4aGqQ
Germany tech.... what a car....
This is why I’m buying a Porsche
The Ferrari sounded the best and I will take the gray Porsche
Porche is the most efficient sports car for it's price
what's wrong with pandas??
Ferrari
Lambo if money is no object else the quickest one Porsche
I think the ferrari sounded the best
Porsche 😍
Italians are always the bests
Porsche 911turbo s - suits me the best of these screamers...
bello pe te fra , sei l inglese più matto che conosca
There is only one car, Porsche!!
Lambo
Porsche 💣💥
Porsche é porsche meus amigos
I would still go for the SF 😍
The Porsche Turbo is a monster!!     But the gorgeous Ferrari is the one.
They all performed pretty closely. It’s about the driving experience. When I look at these cars I don’t see a daily driver. I see a fun weekend car. Not a car to live with. I want a loud and aggressive car. Lamborghini easily wins.
Next Time trie SVJ vs 812 Nlargo vs Gt2rs 🤤
My heart says Porsche  But my money says Renault Twingo for 200 €
so excited he almost pulled the wheel off the car! 4:34 😂
Those 150k likes come from the start of the video :D
Keep your bulls and horses, I'll take the Porsche.
Porsche forever rain supreme
I’d love to have a Porsche if that’s ever gonna happen lol😂
The Aventador sounds like a McLaren F1 GTR
Porche all the way
911 is kings for the money :)
Porsche 💯 would rather be a silent killer than that lambo or Ferrari
The SVJ sounds like a kazoo
Porsche 911 always been my dream car.
Porsche 911 is the man 🤣
Idk why but i notice that every car that is in this channel is always left hand drive
The Porsche is just no frills,,bells or whistles.  But,,any weather,,any car.  Smashed them all.  Massively impressive motor!!!!!
I don't think or care about about Porsche win because I am satisfied with Lamborghini defeated Ferrari . Ferrari shit
Can we get a tesla model s vs the porshe turbo s please
LAMBO
Вывод:учите английский
I would buy the Porsche
i'd have the lambo
did the Porsche  just crushed them both. WOW
The Lambo is the best.
Lemborgini sound is nyc🔥🔥🔥
Porsche NR.1 !!!!!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😛 Ugly Ferrari & Lamborghini 🤢🤢🤢
Ferrari
Porsche Turbo S the best
Wow!!!! I did not see that coming!
Porsche!!!!!
i think the ferrari looks cooler.
you are very good at speaking with Italian accent👍
Ferrari
Hey! Germans arent talking like that
Porsche any day for me
A dream i have since i was kid.. to own a Porsche 911 turbo. If i had the money,i will buy a Porsche and for fun i will rent a Lamborghini or Ferarri.
911 !!!! Always.
How is a 6 cylinder "under powered" Porsche won the race, when the other two have V12 and 800ish horsepower?
lambo sound best
I love how it isn’t even a gt3 or gt2 and it’s still gapping😭
Thats a really good accent
U could. Buy a house for that money
Ferrari for me
ferrari 812 superfast dream car
DRIFTO LAMBORGHINI AUTOMOBILI?
Porsche 💯🎤
I'll choose Porsche or 812
Italians: let's do the noise Germans: let's do our job quietly
Porsche - Dual-Clutch Automatic SHAVER :))))
Svj
What is powering that Porsche? Man that is sick🔥
Porsche  the best...
Sooo funny 7:42 “I pushed my head forward like I was sprinting in a running race”
Lambo
Ferrari for sure
Lambo is the best by a square mile. Will kill the others on a track any day
That Porsche driver was awake.... Every damn chance he was on the money!
911 sounds the best
Porsche. Seems to win most of the time. I'll start saving, should have enough in twenty or thirty years. Ha
I love the ferrari 812 superfast
Porsche is mercedes of f1
Ferrari looks nice
Obviously the Porsche does it all, but the Ferrari is the coolest.
The Ferrari is def the better looking car but that Porsche off the line is just soooo quick

Porsche
Ferrari 812 🤩
You Rock Bro!!
Porsche 911 Turbo SUPERFAST SVJ
I would have the Porsche
Porsche
Italian engineers must be fuming watching this. Kinda disappointed by them tbh.
To answer what car looks the best....NOT Ferrari.
Porsche
I think that the Farrari looks best
Porsche is definetly hiding something
Thag air release from the tire gave some boost to the ferrari 🤣
I’m from Italy the accent was wrong but so funny 😂😂
812 superfast
Lambo
Porsche
porsche is a breath of fresh air
And yet again Porsche remains undefeated
Always bet on Porsche....always
911turbo  is the best
812 all day
I love farry to
I love lambo
Lamborghini love
I think if we record Yanni's time in the first drag race, it should have been the best of SVJ. Really good competition to Porsche!
Porsche the king of Supercars.
Ferrari for sound
I'd take the Ferrari
I like to have the Ferrari head looks better
Porsche
Porsche
911 is the best haha
Porshe
Yianny saying the lambo looks the best, imo the list goes as follows: 1. Porche 2. Ferrari 3. Lambo Out of these three😂
Before I watch the video how much did the Porsche win by
The 812 is better looks
812 sound better v12 Ferrari sound to good
porschE <- SAY OUT LOUD THE EEEEEEEEEE
ferrari !!!!!!!!! <3
911 I’d have  It’s actually usable
The intro is the best mat
When Matt put on that Ferrari hat he added 10whp 😂😂😂
Lambo
It is just been the Porsche R&D.. the weight to power ratio is spot on.. and u can never beat that.. maybe the look is a bit dated.. but its the most versatile
911 terbo ssssssssss epiccccccc
That SVJ looks stunning in the thumbnail
Brain says Porsche because is good looking and so much fast (and also the cheaper). But i'll buy the Ferrari, mostly because of its sound and its look. Even though i prefere the "old" F12
I noticed something cool. Ferrari is Italian and Porsche is German but Lamborghini is owned by VW but built in Italy.
Like I always say, Porsche, no substitute
who else loves rewatching matts videos💀
The Porsche all the day! Better, faster, cheaper and not as loud and flashy!
Porsche all day everyday
I’d chose porsche
What would be useful to note is that normally cars are not compared only in a straight line but in complete circuits. We can't judge these cars so simplistically. Matt's drag races, which by the way I find really interesting and am a big fan of, much as they are nice to watch they are inconclusive as to which is the best car overall and only help understand which car is the fastest for a very limited distance.
911!
Porsche
I love ferrari, I'd go for it
The ferrari is a viper. So the porsch is a vw beetle but no jokes the lambo and porsh look different so u need one of each and a viper😥
I would still choose Ferrari
Porsche all day every day
Porsche is king!
I prefer LAMBORGHINI 😍
The Porsche 911 Turbo S is my favoritt car so i vote the Porsche
Porsche everyday of the week!!
I think i just felt in love
I have watched this vid like 5 times. That porche is just nuts
lol, pursche wins.
Porsche
Wow you guys need to invest in a drone to film overhead at the finish! I’d donate to that!  🚁
I would have a Lamborghini
So basically ferraris are trash
svj and 812
More 911 content, please and thanks.
Ferrari
Yea if you want the letter j in your Lamborghini sv you need to pay 60,000 pounds More
Italians: let's do the noise Germans: let's do the winning
The Porsche hands down
*Idk why but this video reminded me of  *Seb Vettel*
Lambogini
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
812 superfast sounded the best
Came here to see who said porsche sounded the best😆😆😆
that porsche is quite something!
You need a TDF instead of that to beat the Lambo! Lets be honest Lambo was performing better because of The SVJ  model!
The small Porsche went to a fist fight against 2 big boys with 2 pistols and...
That Porsche is ridiculous😂😂
I'd go for the porsche, it's more serene and subtle. The design is more old school, nice curves like a good looking woman. The lambo is too flashy. The ferrari design is nice too
lambo all day
Ferrari
Porsche is the most world car efficiency!
PORSCHE IS LEGIT
That accent man 😂😂😂
THE PORSCHE... IS THE ONE OUT OF THOSE 3 THAT I WOULD BUY.
Holy-F
812 sounds the best
The SVJ needs a dual clutch so bad
Could ANYBODY explain "How did the Porsche win ???"
An Sf90 would smoke an svj tho
You should invite "subscribers" to participate in this drag races
Porsche best car by far and easy to mod and easy to gain more power from what it already has. I think its more worth it after seen this, and money wise.
Porshe
The Porche remains the king of thd hill.
812 Is my favourite
When 10.4 is the losers time
Svj :)
I Love Porsche.
911 all the way
How do the car owners just lend their cars for others to destroy it
I would buy the Porsche, even if it was the slowest...i don't like those "look at me!!!" Designs..The Ferrari looks betten then the Lambo...Porsche's design is the best  Sorry yanni
That 812 😍
Turbo s 😍😍
Wow! That Porsche is something!
Porsche for life. Pure Blood German all the way!!!
Porsche is for civilized people...cz it dosen't make disturbing noises like the other sports cars and its fast too...its performance which matters
Everyone giving out about the Porsche saying it wouldn’t be good on a track.  I dont know about you guys but id take that Porsche  anyday. Especially over the svj. It absolutely blitzed it. All you guys care abt is the “track” racing. You cant have a svj as a daily car you could with a turbo s
Porsche are perfetctly optimised and despite of 120-150hp less and relative big weight wins relative easilly
Svj
Lampo
Porsche fans???
I would have the 911
Yianni went early in the first race.
63 for pecco bagnaia?
The Ferrari sounded best in my opinion.
Yianni is like i am going to break the wheel of every car i bring 🤣
Lambo
The Ferrari is damn ugly tbh.
My vote goes to the Porsche for looks and performance.
No
Porsche 911 All Day!!!
812!
"killed the ferrari though" 😂
Sounds best  ferrari
Lambo King Von’s Worst Nightmare😳😳
Lamborghini SVJ
Ferrari super fastt
911!!!
Lambo jump start
Porsche sounded the best
Lamborghini sounds the best
Porsche sound best
Lmfao I dont even watch this channel often, but when Matt asked who would be in the lambo, I actually thought of Yanni. 😂
yani looks a racing villian
Lambo and the farrari was very well but Porsche killed kicked both of there asses
I'll take the Lambo just for the looks.
Porches
Lol in Norway a normal Aventador costs around $400,000
Porsche looks the best
Don’t judge a book by it’s cover that Porsche destroyed y’all and the Porsche is much cheaper .
Damn!!!!!
Porsche
I have a c7 rs6 700hp and pretty much the thing I most fear seeing next to me at the lights is a Porsche turbo s, credit where due
Porsche
Lamboio
It has always been the same for decades between those three, the Porsche always had quicker acceleration and the Italians a higher top end, and Porsches always had way less power:  80s:  1989 Porsche 930 turbo  300hp 0-60: 5.0 seconds Top speed: 160mph 1989 Ferrari Testarossa 380hp 0-60: 5.5 seconds  Top speed: 175-180mph 1989 Lamborghini Countach  375-455hp 0-60: 5.5-5.0 seconds  Top Speed: ~180mph  90s: 1996 Porsche 993 turbo 400hp 0-60: 3.7 seconds  Top Speed: 180-187mph 1996 Ferrari 512TR 424hp 0-60: 4.7 seconds  Top Speed: 187-192mph 1996 Lamborghini Diablo VT 492hp 0-60: 4.5 seconds  Top Speed: 202mph  And the story goes on...
That porsche tho...
I will get the Lambo over the other two
812 all day
The Ferrari is gorgeous but I just love the Porsche 911 turbo
lambo
I swear yanni keeps jumping early in the videos
Lambo
Porsche 911 turbo S
Would be interesting had the 812 had Trofeo R rubber on it like the SVJ. Not bad for regular PZero shoes. At least you guys could have fitted the 812 with the TdF shoes so that the playing field was more level compared to the SVJ.
Ferrari is the better one 😂😂
Lamborghini svr
Love your Program, my dream is drive a cara in your Program... Keep like that
Nothing can beat that German engineering huh
911 keep the other 2
When Mat reved his Ferrari in the inside is was like 😳🤩
Porsche
If l was paying for the car with my own money, I'd buy the Porsche. BUT, I'd definitely rather HAVE the 812 Superfast!
The absolute best intro in carwow. Impeccable accents!
Italia ☺👍
812 superfast or a F12 TDF
Pose
My favorite car is ferrari and it looks awesome man! Just love it
Aventador svj for sure
Porsche has so many variations of cars that all look the same I can’t keep up..
Porsche is Porsche. And I love this car. Car, that has a soul.
Is their any car to beat this porsche 911 turbo S ?😂😂😂
Cheat: middle car left early
Lambo
See porshe only have the fastest escalation it can reach 0 to 100 on 1.1 sec and it's top speed is 312 kilometres per hour so I think the farrari and the lambo is the best for racing with porshe
turbo S : 비싼 bottle신들 ㅋㅋㅋ
Yeah you can't beat a Porsche, what's new.
Lamborghini sounds better 🔥🔥❤
Ferrari
Lamborghini
Porsche is the silent killer
A porshe 911 turbo s
Ferrari 812 supper fast
Porsche if i had to actually use it daily Ferrari for the race track Lambo for showing off
Ferry is best
I laughed way too hard at the Porsche... need to apologise now hahahha
Porsche is the best. I love it's sound speed and shape.
Svj
It's because it's German what do you actually expect.
Now if we can get the Porsche to look like a super car then we’d be set, till then Ferrari/Lamborghini still wins for me
No vabbè, addirittura una carriola della Porsche...  andiamo male..
The Porsche has the speed, and the price The Ferrari has the looks, and the sounds And the Lambo......is kind of in the way.
The Ferrari sounds so much better than the SVJ. Nothing to say about the 911, simply the best.
For me the SVJ just that Naturally V12 scream and that freaking amazing look... omg
4:20  The 911 is the strong, silent type, sent to destroy you
I love Yianni's reactions in these videos behind the wheel. This one was a classic and a very tight race.
Porsche only!
I don't believe the SVJ. Looks like a cheeky race car
Lamborghini Aventador svj
Id go for the Ferrari all day !
porsch
These cars got nothing on my Hyundai i10.
The SVJ is so magnificent!
Yannimize spent to much time doing what he is the best doing it, undergoing all the crevaces of lambos...he now suffer from the Stockholm syndrom
I haven't the slightest idea why but after every one of these videos where the Porsche eats other supercars alive from a launch, I always end the video wanting the other cars more. Can't really justify it 😂
Porsche is the best by far!!!!
Damn they were doing 190!!!
Damn his stupid 😂
Im takin the 911 everyday🤙🏻
Porsche
Porsh all day
Porshe looks the best imo
Aventador
The Lamborghini is not bad for a car with 10 year old plattform and outdated gearbox + its the fastest around an racetrack
Lmao, we italians don't talk like this 🤦‍♂️
I would love to have that Porsche 911 Turbo. Always have been and always will be my favourite dream car.
Porsche is the silent killer .
The German accent killed me 😂
Porche or Ferrari
That Porsche sounds like a vacuum cleaner😂
Ferrari sounds better
Ferrari
I like farrie
Ferrari is for losers, just look how they’re doing in F1
Poooooooooorchee
The ferrari 812 .. iss the sexiest
Maybe find something like Underground Racing Aventador? So damn rare. I really like tt aventador sound.
The Porsche sits silently at the top
Yours
I would definitely have the Porsche
Lamborghini svj
Porsche !
Ferrari
A Tuned Porsche costs less than 1 of the other Cars and does the 1/4m under 10 seconds and has at least a bit of Sound with an aftermarket exhaust
"Action speak louder than words" Mr Porsche
I’d rather a Porsche always
The Porsche looks like a great weekend car for everyone, but it's a beast. The two other cars look more like a beast, but they don't deliver as much performance as one could expect. Why is the Ferarri so heavy, what's the deal?
Porsche: the quickest. Ferrari: the fastest. Lamborghini: the best handling, best sounding, best looking, best track time!!!
Yeah man. Don´t fuck around with a Porsche
porshe 911
I would definitely buy the 812 superfast
Farrari sounds the best
That Porsche is mind blowing with that little boxer engine. Awesome!
For when you need to get somewhere .2 seconds faster
I mean, the lambo's motor is still made by the same simple germans who make the porsche's
Ferrari
Would have Porsche for sure
Ferrari
Porsche all the way.  Super car that you can use day to day basis without any warnings and servicing all the time.  Ferrari needs looking after like F1. Every few laps!
I drive a VW so....P!
Drag races exists:  Porsche: vacuum cleaner go brrrrrrrrrrrr
That porsche is completely out of the question and competition
That porsche is to fast
That Porsche is a polite monster
That dude in lambo seems like an overexpressing stupid. He got to grow up first.
I’ll take the lambo
You guys should do this test to slow cars, something like Skoda Fabia, SEAT Ibiza and Volkswagen Polo...
Porsche was like huh...ametuers
All day everyday 911.
Porsche
Ferrari 812
ferrari 812
How is the porsche faster than these beasts

Por isso eu gosto de Porsche, tem o melhor custo benefício, anda muito e bem mais barato q as outras marcas 👌🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Lamborghini SVJ
Porsche every time
Porches

I would really luv a Ferrari
Svj any day
Definitely the Ferrari V12...
Porsche

Late launch for the ferrari
911
I love the chemistry between Yanny and Matt 😂😂 this race litterally had me on the edge of my seat great video!
The Lambo guy is killing me leaving his car in Strada. Corsa!!!
Imagine the Porsche highly tuned especially a good exhaust  👌👌
Ferrari's rpm meter goes almost 9k rpm
How hi say " ciao bella " 😂😂😂
Porsche
If I have one of these cars then I will pick the Lamborghini
Lambo
Porsche is actually insane, such a sleeper wtf
Ferrari 812 because is like the grotri itali gto in GTA v, is my favourite and is super fast
Ferrari 812 superfast
Ferrari has good interiors
Ferrari all day!
The SVJ is overrated
911 Turbo S amazing car
Ferrari 812 looks way betta
Man......that 911 Turbo though FAST FAST phew 😏
Wow.... did you really just use your shoe and kick the door open on the Ferrari when you stopped to check the tyre.... no respect whatsoever.
Ferrari
Just f**k of East or West  lamborghini is best
porsche is FAR better than both     in looks too imo
f
And now Lambo fanbois be like " Oh nO LaMBo is MeaNt to Be Track Car It's Not Meant To RaCe in StRaight LiNe" Like really a  car which is like 200000 pound less than Lambo defeated it,  Porche anyday
Being the cheapest car I mean by 200000 pound margin i feel like definitely porche is the car to go for
What happened to the Porsche in the 2nd rolling race no one even brought it up
Svj..!!!!
I meeeean... porsches probs have the best jandling
I wanna have the lamboooooo
That Prosche is  a silent assassin...
Porsche is better. Thats IT👍
The Porsche sounded the best
Lamborghini
Like Matt said : that Grey looking thing to the right is the best car :) Porsche
That's what happens when a turbo is in a Porsche or any car
Porsche is the best
Matt there is like  800  Horsepower in that Ferrari
Only won “Lamborghini “
Ferrari
Turbo S!!! Anyday!!
Porsche and Ferrari
PORSCHE...
Aventador looks better but the porche is much better
Barking dog seldom bite😜🐔🐔🐔
My boss has both the 812 and the 911 in his garage that also has various other exotic cars but of all of them the one that catches my attention the most is the orange Porche GT3 RS
The Porsche is a driving engineering genius! Just look https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5oo6i-ahW4&t=118s
Tesla plaid lol
porsche
All the Porsche fans in these comments
Love how passionate Yianni is with this shit lmaoooo
I’d reckon the best car would be the Ferrari it looks pretty nice but still I think mr Lamborghini is a bit better
the aventador sounds awesome!!!!!
good italian pronuncietion
Yianni always has a head start the cheat
Posche uber Alles
Ferrari is meant to be fast and good looking. Lambo, sloooowwww🤣😂. Porche, hold my speed🤣😂
Ferrari but not by much, the SVJ is awesome. Actually they all three are crazy.
nice content keep up with another video. subscribe your channel
the Porsche got a bigger win the 2nd time round ¿ omg
PORSCHE IS RIDICULOUS !
Porsche because its the perfect balance between performance and luxury, which the Lamborghini and Ferrari are mainly performance based and don't focus on luxury too much.
Porsche:     hold my beer
Ugly lambo sound
That was Yanis demise 😂
This Video was like.... Oh the Porsche is winning anyway, lets just focus on Ferrari vs lambo
Porsche sounded the best
Ufff that Porsche is fucking fast!
If I could have any I would definitely take the Ferrari
Ferrari 488gtb can beat porsche turbo s
I have own porsche
I would have a Ferrari looking like a Lamborghini and German tech from Porsche...
Porsche turbo s, beautiful, understated, excellent
Haters will say he meant the thing about the views
The 812 is clearly quicker then Lambo. Lambo has awd off the line how they haven't put a dual clutch in the Aventador is a crime
PORSCHE 😍
The 812 superfast won the sound check
Lambo, all day, every day!!! 😁 it looks soo much better than the Ferrari
I’d definitely have the Porsche
Porsche😃😃 power of silence ❤❤
911 any day every day... other 2 screams I have a small ....
Porsche without a doubt
Yanny You can look to the right yo see our good !
Porsche 911
Farrier
Lambos goin down
rather have a Ferrari than Lambo
FERRARI sounds great
Old is Gold. Ferrari 🏆
can u stop talking and do the stupid race
TO ARACE WITH BUGATTI CHIRON OR VEYRON
I would get the Porsche, because it would live longest of all the three cars
Vauxhall meriva v juke please
Porsche
Drone footage would really be nice 🙄
911!!!!!!!!!!
What they dont understand is the SVJ is a track focused car not a drag focused one
Lamborghini Aventador svj
Nice Into very nice Impressions
Aventador is the sexiest and has best sound of the three. But Porsche is Made in Germany.
THE POWER OF TURBO,!!
Ferrari sounds better
Audi R8
If I could pick color and spec, Porsche all day.. In these exact configurations, I'd take the 812.
Porche power fans, like here
wanna know how to embarass supercar owners? Get a 911 turbo s.
7:35 Lol.... Big guy very angry
Actually Lambo cause looks ,speed And performance
That Porsche held its own!  Good lawd !
Ferrari all day every day
Lamborghini is loud
Don't bash the displacement of the Porsche
Porsche all day every day👍🏽👌🏽
Sooooo Porsche Turbo S is the way to go.  Not only the fastest and the best brakes, the cheapest by a wide margin and probably the most reliable and least expensive to maintain/repair.  Not to mention it won't be a cop magnet like the other two will be.
The Porsche is like: You paid how much to lose??
4:03  look yanni in the lampo going crazy
All the cars
do a buggati veyron supersport vs porche 911 turbo s
Ferrari
Ulan Porsche Ben sana Çekmişim
Porsche all day
i would take the lambo , i’ll sell it , i’ll buy a porsche rs2 and a toyota land cruiser
why would you buy a lambo after seeing this video?
Ferrari then Porsche and never the Lamborghini because every other chav seems to have one
So the race basically between the Lambo and the Ferrari 😂
Lambo started early
Lamb
Mat should buy a ferrari 812 superfast
If you were going to buy a super car ..you would actually buy one that looks the part ... definitely not the one that looks like a Volkswagen  Beetle
what type of flat engines they re putting on porsche
Svj
I will take the Porsche any day, take the additional money I saved and invest it.
Porche
A german doesn’t to be loud. Last time a german was loud it took the allies and communist to calm him down
SVJ
Porsche all the way
man just imagine if ferrari had built that car 4 wheel drive lol
PorschE, NOT Porsch PLEASE!
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but the clean and sedated simple beauty of the Porsche has my heart.  I would say the Ferrari is also beautiful but a bit in your face, and the Lambo is a bit too much in your face but still looks great.
Porsche looks better
For over 150k the porsche  needs a better exhaust
Winner or not best sounding and best looking out the bunch imo not a fan of the wing on svj still amazing car , on the Porsche it’s like that one quite kid in class that everyone underestimates
I love Porsche 🦾😍
PORSCHE: fuufuuuuuuu I WIN
Ferrari sounds the best im not gonna lie
Lamborghini and Ferrari: We are the fastest Porsche: Well no but actually no
Ferrari
on the sound lamborghini wins  but in terms of performance porsche is the king
Porsche
Is that porsche on drugs?
I would have the Ferrari
Lamborghini aventedor svj is like top model of lambo so you should take laferrari
Sorry italians, but german cars are so much better and faster
Rwd Vs 2 Awd?  Not fair!
That Porsche is mad😭
I love the Lamborghini
Svj jumped the start
911 the best
Why don't you involve more US cars in your videos?
No 1 cares about your life  Is the car ok
svj
I'd have the ferrari every day of the week, 10 times on saturdays
SVJ
Porsche♥️💪🏻
svj is the fastest in terms of top speed
I would take the SVJ, sell it, and buy the Turbo S with money left over afterwards.
5:05 Sums up every Ferrari owner and the company themselves LOL  porsche and the corvette are basically best friends both blur the lines between supercar and sports car.
i would have porsche
porche
Destruction by Porscha. It was the Turbo S, imagine the GT2 RS with 700 HP. No better grip or launch than the rear engine Porsche.
"Barking dogs seldom bite."
It proves, at this range, no car better than the other when it comes to drive in the straight lines. so keep cool and drive safe on public roads. do whatever on Nordschleife.
I, as an Italian, get reeeally annoyed at American/English-speaking people doing an Italian accent
i expected the svj to lose int the rolling race here cause its down on power compared to the ferrari and that little bit of torque doesn't fill that gap
Porsche 911 922 turbos S
The 911 will forever be the best al around car in existence
That Porsche really did business with less horsepower and less cylinders...  but it sounds like a vacuum cleaner 😂😂
Ferrari do some noise for nothing
Porsche probably on mute
812 superfast
Lamborghini svj
PORSCHE!!! 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Porsche 911 turbo s all day!!!
Enough with normal cars, I think tou have enough money to do a Koeniggsegg vs Rimac Vs hypercars drag races
Bull and horse against a frog just a frog
I love his German accent, it's nice
interesting
In my opinion the Ferrari looks and sounds the best
Porsche- Silent but Deadly. 🤣🤣🤣
Lmao Ferrari is a GT. If they made a V12 version of the track car then they would definitely be faster!
Lamborghini everyday all day
the smart decision is the porsche ofcourse with a exhaust and a tune will be much faster and still cheaper. so I chose the lambo....
I don't think I'd buy one of these, because the companies allowed this to be filmed like this. Very charismatic, very elegant, very funny, very attractive bods staring at themselves or staring at the camera and talking, very entertainingly, while giggling like adults do and saying very important and thrilling things into a walkie-talkie. So, I don't think I'd buy a Porsche, a Lamborghini or a Ferrari - or any Fiat, in fact.
911 turbo
5:24 Seconds before the race starts. Looks like the Superfast isn't fast enough. My Hyundai can beat them all
Woohooo... That 911 is nasty as hell!!!. Grimy!!!.. And was pulling away. My choice? Ferrari for the hoes. Porsche for everything else...
Lamborghini aventador svj
I love the lambo but the Ferrari sounds better
olha as comparação   porsche turbo s  1.360 000 000  Ferrari 812    3 milhões  reais  lamborguinne svj  7 milhões de reais      não tem nem lógica comparação
look how late his start was in the ferrari needs a redo
Ferrari sounds the best
Farari
Turbo S for sure.
Comment if the lambo is the best looking
ferrari
Its the Ferrari for me.
SVJ
I am a fan of a labo
Imagin how fast the Porsche would be, if the Porsche ingenieurs gave him the same emission output dirt, like the rari and the lambo got... Porsche is so fukking amazing
Ferrari
PORSCHE ALL DAY EVERY DAY
The porche Just sounded awsome
lol all fake
Porche was the best
haha the distance betweeen cars :))))) they dont want to crash :))))))
4:58  The sound of the v12 lambo is👌  Thank me later
the porche
Yanni cheats every time!!!! He goes before girl lowers arms!!!! Cheater!
Porsche all day is my choice and that wasn't even the tippy top porsche either lol
VOTE: Ferrari 812 Superfast
Cute one is the porsche. And best
I choose Porsche 911 Turbo S anytime
SCHLAND!!!
Wait till Tesla roadster 2020 comes out , everyone will instantly switch to electric
Why you guys do Porsche so bad😂
German cars rule!
LAMOB
It's obvious the SVJ
Porsche no1 💪👌
PORSCHE 911 TURBO S a big thumbs up!!!
Ferrari
I like the Ferrari the most
I respect Porsche sooo much more after watching the video
Porshe just go poooof
deffinitely would take the ferrari for the beautyness.
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ is best
Yanni didn't even bother to look at the Porsche...its about beating Mat...LOL...
Aventador SVJ any day
Lambo
I think the lambogini is good
For all the car noobs commenting: Yes, the 911 costs less.  Yes, you will win every absolutely no satisfaying drag at the red traffic light.  Yes, you will struggle a 30s gap to both the italians on any circuit.  Yes, that engine sounds pathetic.  No, you will not seem rich.
Rip 812 super fast
Lamborghini ____I GOT U FERRARI Ferrari___________I GOT U LAMBORGHINI  ..le PORSCHE ____😂😂shut the fu!ck up u two 🔥🔥
The  Porsche 100%, it's clearly the better car in every way except for that 1 race.
Porsche all day
porsche
It did what it is suppose to do...AWD beats RWD in a drag race.  If money wasn't the issue, no one will take the Porsche over the other 2 car.
Porsche: everyday, all day
Obviously everyone would take the Ferrari
I like the 812
I think you should do a Mclaren 720'S vs the Ferrari F12 vs Porsche 911 turbo
I think the Tesla Model S Plaid would wipe all three of these off the map and drive the family to church on Sunday. Sad really!
I’ll buy the Porsche cus it’s like a sleeper car
SVJ was my first car.
Lambo jump started first one.
Definitely would take porsche and gamble the money between.
The SVJ sounds the best
Lamborghini false start by a long way
Ferrari 812 Superfast ❤️
360k to end up second...
I would take a Porsche all day over any
Lamborghini is better
Porsche all the way and everyday....Great value for money actually the best, no use limitations can be used in daily bases
The ferrari superfast 812
Ferrari for life
The car I would have??  Undoubtedly the Ferrari, it is the most beautiful specially in that black... but honestly considering the price and the 4 wheel drive the best car is the 911!!
Lambo
911
porsche
i want a porshe becouse is the cheapest and it have 650hp but it is crash the ferrari and lamborgini.
That Porsche
im genuinely very surprised from the porsche
Italian hot guys, can't beat the german well designd vacuumcleaner lol
porsche  its cheap but  its quick ,why spend more than should
Ferrari cause that makes your ears explode lambo gives you a headache and Porsche true its fast but its too economic no noise.
Once again  THE QUIET KILLER 911 LAMBOS AND FERRAS are for lil kids that like to brag
The jump start from the lambo at the first race
VW vs Fiat
lamborghinui
get 2 porches that are faster and still got change left for gas
That Porsche is astonishing. I’m a Ferrari fan but...
Porsche is king
lambogini svj
Lamborghini = my friends in class
Embarrassing for these Italian boys
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Porsche first, Italy last😂
I would have the Turbo S booth Panamera and 911 🤪
911 is like the hot girl in school
Porsche car wow now🥰🥰
Porsche Turbo S is an awesome car. Lamborghini Aventador is still the best.
If the SVJ did not have an ancient transmission, than it would be an easy choice!
No need for flash & flair when you're confident about your abilities, Porsche.
Ferrari 812 superfast
I would get a Porsche
Lambo SVJ is the one I want. The Porsche is boring. The Ferrari is ugly.
The Ferrari sounded the best but you could tell they were barely revving the Porsche. Put an exhaust system on the Porsche and it would win easily.
Germany have  the have the best Cars the world
812 is the best looking and most worth it car ever ngl
I'd have the Ferrari 812 .  Not black on black, though.
Read the mentality of people here just dismissing the Lamborghini a lot. Yani is not a good driver. During the first drag, I believe the Aventador can be as fast as the 911. These races should have standards and rules before racing to get an accurate result.   That Lamborghini Aventador SVJ is the king!
Poni vs horse vs bull  Poni wins
Lamborghini aventador svj
svj is my dream
svj all day
Lamborghini SVJ
Ferrari is the most beautiful.
Id have the svj
Germany all day.
I just wanna know WTF ARE THEY FEEDING THAT PORSCHE cuz that thing is bat shit fast. If given the chance id still choose the aventador if given the chance though
I'll take the 812 personally, gorgeous!! Porsche always impresses though, amazing cars.
812 for me
Nothing in this world will ever beat that Ferrari V12 sound 🔥🙉
Don’t mess with Porsche’s PERIOD  hyper cars against Turbo S, imagine a 918 spyder here 😆
i think id have the turbo s. still love aventador and 812 tho
Ferrari: Fastest one, it’s me  Lamborghini: Everybody wants me  Porsche: Hold my beer
Fun fact: Porsche is used to record the other cars.
Porsche course
Can someone please teach Matt that it's Porsch-AH! Not Porsh.
Porsche. Porsche is all class.
Lamborghini
its not even the gt2 like....bruh
glad the Porsche won, specially on the rolling drag race to see the faces of Matt particularly Yani to shut up for quite some moment is priceless....😂😂😂
porsche simply the best
i wood have svj
The Ferrari is all about top end, the engine stroke must be very short like the superbike!
Can u make a rece between McLaren 765lt vs pprche 911 turbo s Lets see who wins
Lamborghini svj
Porsche is gonna rip the Lamborghini and the Ferrari ass.
Por-sha allll day long thank you very much! 😃🕺
German cars are kings   I don't get it why people love Ferrari and lambo over the gorgeous Porsche
Porsche is fucking PORSCHE man! Damn this incredible car!!
The German just took a colossal crap allll over you guys 😂😂😂😂😂 This was great! 🤣
If you're a Porsche fan every drag race I have watched in this channel Porsche always win
I pray who ever reads this becomes successful in life.....
false start by the lambo...couldnt even win lmao
Svj
Put a GTR here and restart the whole drag..                Nah im kidding, 😂😂😂😂
Ferrari: we don't want advice from a tractor mechanic Lamborghini: please watch this video 😂😂  Hats off #Ferruccio_Lamborghini 👏🏼
porsche as always  always reliablea
Porsche like🖕
What about lamborghini Egoista
Always lombo sounds best
I would love Lambor, the Porsche is ugly for me,
That Porsche ain't Playing Games damn, Lambor for Flexing, Ferrari for Bosses.
Ferrari 812 all day long and night 💋
If I had to chose one I would chose the Ferrari
Ferrari  I love you 😍😚
Lamborghini aventendor svj
SvJ would be the sickest car out of those 3
Porsche 🔥
When you drag with a Ferrari and lamborghini and Porsche win 🤣🤣🤣
PORSCHE PORSCHE IS BETTER 4 EVER
Porsche Faster and cheaper than rari and lambo
So Russell Peters is into car reviews now 🤔
Only 156000 pounds. 😂❤️🥂
Well I Love That 63 Car and THAT PORCHE
Philenes..
My Dream Car Was Lambo Avtadoor Thats My Fav And Tesla Roadster.... Pls Give My Dream Car loc: Golded Shower St Lot 15 lot 14
Definitely!! The Porsche  my friend, can I have that porsche please (CAR WOW),, 😂🤣🙏..
this video proves that single clutch does not really affect drag races its beyond control and reflexes of the driver
Definitely the Porsche - it is better, cheaper and has a brand that suits me well.
Go for porsche, with the money saved can buy a new exhaust. :-)
If money was no object the 812. If I had 400.000 pounds id take the Porsche. Reliability is awesome with Porsches
911 all day
Porch is the loudest
Porsche: It aint over till the fat lady sings 😎 Ferrari: Horse shit 😂 Lambho: Bullshit 🤣
Porsche
That ferrari is like a batmobile..nice
Porsche!
If I could only have one of those cars it would be one of those fab sounding V12's,  BUT the Porsche is an amazing everyday machine that I would love to own and drive to work! I would definitely change the exhaust on the Porsche.
Bravo to the Porsche engineers! WOW!
That was fun!
It blows my mind that those go pros don't fall off.
Ill take the Porsche all day everyday
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Porsche horsepower is not normal horsepower 😭
Lambo... ALL DAY, EVERYDAY
The Porsche is no joke 🙆‍♂️🔥 I love Germans really 😁
Que locos!!!!
The germans did it again, porsche is the silent killer. Amazing, especially, this is “just” the turbo s. The black ferrari looks insane.
I’ll have that 812🤤
Ferrari beautiful sound that only Ferrari can make!
Definitely Porsche 911 turbo s 2021
the cool kid jock, the bully and the quiet kidd
If u can't pronuounce Porsche properly than remember it's just porsh ++ aa. Porscha (sound)
Ferrari 812 super fast in the kinda blueish green so mint
SVJ 4 life
812 sounds better
I like how Yani leans forward to make the car go faster
laammbbooooooo all the way
the rari sounds best
Yianni : “Not pull the steering wheel off the car”  Lmaooooo
Ferrari, no doubt.
Yianni is a hooligan 🤣🤣🤣
Hey guys, if possible could you put the trap speed at which they pass the 1/4 mile at? That would be great, thanks! This SVJ seemed slower than the other one you just tested against the huracan performante, great video regardless cheers.
Just 911
Pick the Porsche and do a body kit, upgrade exhaust, engine, turbo, then we have looks, Screaming flat 6, mad performance, (Porsche is an allrounder and subtle looking car, btw think about gt rs series if you think Porsche can't look supercar) even after this upgrades it will be still less than to buy the other two, stock Porsche is still elegant to me 💯❤️.
My dream car is also on Lamborghini Aventador SVJ so I am picking the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ okay the Ferrari is fine but now
Porsche is wolf in a sheep cloth!!💥❤️
Sorry Mat, but I would have to go for the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ Just because of the looks and sounds 😍👌 Way to go Yianni!!
That 911 is a dream.
Lambo
i'd want an svj but roadster
Overhyped cars got destroyed by one of Porsche’s slower race cars, seriously wonder what happens if they brought a gt2 rs or 918 to one of these races...
easy for the porsche ........
SVJ wethout any adoupt
Lambo SVJ
The Porsche is an absolute silent killer ❤️🙌🏻👌
So you can spend 100-200k more for the Ferrari or Lambo to be slower or save the money and get a 911 Turbo.
Lambo SVJ
Less power  Less torque  More weight  Still wins . Typical porsche. Edit: wtf 1.3k likes.
What is that Porsche made of ???😲😲
The Porsche is epic and undoubtedly the better car for everyday usage but isn't it about which one people look at, the car that gets kids talking. If aren't knowledgeable about cars everyone goes for the Lamborghini they do because it looks mad
Porsche all day, Porsche every day 👌🏽🔥
Ferrari
That Porsche is unbelievably quick
SVJ
svj is the best
812 sounds better
Turbo S because I am 6'7 tall
Turbo S
Jannie jumped the start first time round.
Imagine if that ferrari was 4 wheel drive..
Money no object....I'd still take the Ferrari. I love the shape and even though it's the slowest of the line it's probably the best driver being rwd.
Ferrari i have big v12 Lamborghini me to Porsche old mu beer
if only aventador had pdk, wouldve been more interesting
Fate formula 1 contro supra 1000 cavalli
Porsche is a old design body with monster engine!!! Wow!
Would have none of these lol
911 💯
Porsche is Porsche. Over.
the lambo sound the best
The best looking one is the super fast 💨 fucking batmobile
The Ferrari got one of the best bottoms but the front is just ugly
damn porsche...
7:33 Lambo won
Porsche for sure. Style and price with performance.
Then a ferrari
I'd rather have a lambo
Ferrari
SVJ
Lambo rev up sweet holy gosh what a sound!!
yet the porsche destoys them both for fun at half the price
Ferrari
8:33 the face says it all,trying to stay positive ha ha.
Yianni always false starts and you're bad at starting. OMG!  Mate have you tried the Ferrari F12 TDF?
812 superfast
Dreams/Ferrari ; Reals/Porsche
Lambo's sound only killed everyone
porsche because it is the fastest and also most usable
Hahahah... that Ianis hat win that round!
Porsche rules. Again.

911 Turbo S is my dream car, and thanks to XRP it will be mine soon.  I like it's understated looks and sound.  I'm not looking to piss off my neighbors.
Lambo sounds better than any other super car
Beaten by just a 911 turbo.... I want to see the same but with a gt2rs OR gt3rs... Because it could be even more brutal for italians
One Porsche 911 turbo S please.
5:03 me riding a lambo on my wii remote thinking im in the grand prix
Lambo
So... the best Italian cars are the ones the Germans built 🤣
911
lamboghini sounded the best
I knew the Porsche was gonna win why I love Porsche all the other cars bark but don’t bite the Porsche doesn’t bark but bites!
Holy shit!!! Porsche is killing every brand in normal and electric engines. It’s fucking insane
Why doesn’t the Porsche have at-least a exhaust yet
Svj
Lamborghini
i have no one... but I love 911Ts since I was born
just imagine what the svj would be with the gearbox from the performante
Porsche: all the way!!!
Porsche... no doubt, always a Winner!
Porsche! 💪🏻
Porsche
That is the ugliest Ferrari I've seen in a great many years, so that is totally out. Lambo haven't made a nice looking car in over a decade. Sure, they look extreme, but they don't look pretty. So despite not being a big fan of Porsche, it's still the one I'd have out of these three.
I’d get the Porsche w/ a better exhaust
#Lambo
Porsche silent but fast Ninja status
Porsche 911 turbo s
The Porsche just needs a muffler delete and it would sound awesome
Ferrari
Lamborghini aventador svj is the better car is got the ala System so is better
Shoutout for that King810 Shirt 🔥🤘
Love how the porche driver gets no attention but wins all of these drag races lol.
That intro was hilarious
Porsche the silent killer
there is an "E" in Porsche - so don't say "Porsh"   greetings for ze Germans ;-)
Would love to see the Porsche vs 720s
"Can we talk about the Porsche winning?"  "No, let's talk about the bull beating the horse mate let's talk about that!" I am in stitches 😂😂😂😂😂😂
7:34 The purest of emotions.... :)
Ferrari.
6:58 Why are we here, just to suffer..... Mat ❤️
That porsche is fast as f**k bro  Respect for Porsche bro
The porsche though 🤣😭
Even tho SVJ is a hypercar it still loses
LAMBORGHINI IS COOLEST
lambooooooooooooooooooooooo!
Lambo!
Ferrari best sound
Turbo S is my pick always....can still go to the local market without looks!
I would have the svj
Absolutely best looking out of these 3 is the Porsche. Elegant and Beautiful lines. Oh yea plus it just beat the shit out of the other 2
How many hp on the svj?
it would be amazing a drag race between a McLaren 720s an Aston Martin Vulcan and a Lamborghini Aventador
This is my favorite YouTube channel forever
This is my favorite YouTube channel forever
Ferrari. Because it's a Ferrari, although, I'd be fussy and ask for an F12 TDF
A screaming car doesn't mean that is fast😉
Ferrari
Me, one day when I become a millionaire: "It's fastest to 60 , fastest quarter mile, best built, reliable, comfortable. I'll have the Po.....I'll have the Porr...... Porsch.....THE FERRARI. I'll have the Ferrari."
Porsche, that's the daily car for any day & time .. nothing coming near
The revving it was the Ferrari F 12
I love how Porsche is always presented as 640 HP, when in all practicality it is 720 for these drag racing videos.
911 always ❤️
PORCHE FOR SURE
Porsche
Best drag race ever on this channel!!
Turbo S
The porsch is obviously the most beautiful car
How disappointing must that be for other manufacturers to build a car with 200hp more and 200 000 more money and still loose to a top quality car for nearly half the price which a 3.8l engine which u can use daily?   How would it feel for the ones that buy those car and still get destroyed every single time by a Porsche!?
I think the accents has been en pointe!
I will happely take a ferrari 812 super fast
The ferrari is prettier imo
I am big lambo fan but this black ferari whit yelow looks beutiful
Can I test drive first?
Would love to see Lamborghini Aventador SVJ vs McLaren 720s!!!
Lambo sound better
DODGE DEMON WITH RACING MODE VS THIS TURBO WITH PERFORMANCE TYRES
I'd have the Ferrari any day of the week!
Ferrari 812 superfast it looks so good in it’s unique way
Das Auto 🇩🇪🏁🏁
Lamborghini
Svj!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Power only is not enough,weight does matter
You kidding the Ferrari is the one for me
repent all your sins
Hahaha that Porsche is BRUTAL... Eat the dust kids!
Porsche everyday! Designers must’ve been on some Sub-Saharan weed when they were designing that car! Ten point what?
Ferarii sounds better than both to me
Lamborghini 💪💪👌
Follow please 🙏
Ferrari
Porsche 👑♥️
Ferrari is always the best
Porsche is the beast
Lamborghini
It aint bout being fast,ts about the looking,that massive engine noise and ofcz their perfomance are all astonishing..all great cars, but then Lambo is the big boy...my all time fav car down the sun
Porsche is and always be the best. Sexiest curves
I'd take the Pfister Comet.
Lambo 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🥸🥸🥸🥸🥸🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙
He speaks italian..    Ciao!
IS that YIANNI"s personal aventador
This channel always puts me in a good mood!
Geese matt is insane with the svj
I still want the new Porsche 911 turbo s bad. The great thing is the front of the Lamborghini will look great in the rear view mirror of the Porsche. My future daily/track car, somehow. The Porsche does not sound or look as good but performance daaaaamm.
"COME ON'
Porsche
Porsche 🤘
Sorry for not knowing about cars but bruh your telling me the Porsche is really the best car to get for the speed?
Porsche all the way
Ferrari
Porsche 911 all the way 😃👍
I will have a lambergene avterdor svj
The Porsche...
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
Porsche dealership just took a load of deposits
German engineering on a car that continues to be refined for over 50 years. If it ain't broke, make it better !
"this is the first time he's lent it to anyone" *revs the ever-living shit out of it*
Always loved Porsche since childhood!
lambo always false start
488 pista or SF90
The posh sounded very good no cap ;)
Porsche is Baki Hanma he's always the underestimated one😭
my dna loves posche so posche
More about 812 Ferrari and gtc4 Please
Great accent  my friend !!🏆
The cmnt section is full of Porsche crap stories
4:13 They shouted at her because she had no sound, but the shock was so fast ,After this video I fell in love with Porsche ❤
Porsche... don't want to look like a complete tossa
LMABO GANG
I like how it was just the Lambo vs the Ferrari, the porsche just blew them away, well, not really but you know what I mean
If I could get only one, I'll have the Lambo. Then, I'll just sell it and buy a 911 Turbo S Cabriolet
Porsche, There Is No Substitute Tom Cruise
The look on Yiannis face as their racing lol.
I'd have 911 turbo s 992 ANY DAY
Everytime porsche. 992 is awesome.
Ferrari 812 superfast
When the Porsche is the fastest cheapest most reliable most practical and most fuel efficient wouldn’t be  surprised if it was best handling too
SVJ by a mile 💪💪💪💪
Porsche probably forgot to put on sports mode
Id take the superfast. Not as flashy show off as lambo, but not as relatively dull as the porche
Ferrari sounds the best. Just like an F1 car! I would have to drive the Ferrari and Lambo before I could choose one. The Porsche basically outperforms and can be driven daily.
Porsche all the way!
Ferrari.
911 Turbo for me but in yellow haha
Honestly ill either take the 812 or the poŕsche as there way better in daily, rather then battling the svj just to get some groceries😅😂
Lambo sounded the best and I would get it lambo
cheaper is better！
If only the Porsche sounded as good as the other 2
Ferrari, always! Tifosi
I would say the porche
Ill take the 911s
Aventador SVJ Looks great Sounds great Fast enough but not faster than Flat 6 porche 😂  I will pick aventador any day
I would take the SVJ
Ferrari sounded the best like if you agree
Yanni always jumps the start on these drag races!!
Ламборгiнi$$$
LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR SVJ IS THE BEST Like if you agree 👇
We need a McLaren 765lt drag race
Didn’t even use the GT2 RS 😂
That Porsche was build by witchcraft
Porsche, because it will not break down.
Porsche is better, but Ferrari looks best
The porsche has 150hp less than the ferrari and lambo iam wondering what is going to happen if it had 800hp ...
Porsche amassou em todas sem fazer barulho 😎😎🤙🤙👍
I love porche 911
The 911 turbo s is gonna win but the svj and 812 super fast sounds good
Don't forget the Porsche is also a 4 seater. Probably is better on fuel too
Ferrari all day every day
Porche
Porsche- daily driver, but kicking a**  Lambo- show off car, loud sound  Ferrari- more elegant than the lambo, but almost the same
that porche is the silent kid in class that never talks but gets only 10s in his grades.
Ferrari
911 turbo s
Turbo VS NA Big Deal
Porsche and its cheaper
I think the Lamborghini looks the best
10:53 -The look on his face when he said that 😂 . Another awesome video
Ferrari
Porsche best by far
The ferrari is the Dogs bollocks
I'll take Ferrari on looks and porsche for drive
The aventador svj
What a bunch of knob heads.
The Porsche every day of the week as it’s probably the only true sports car for everyday use and engineering genius. The Lamborghini looks too OTT and the Ferrari really is neither one or the other.not
Lamborghini
i love the intro of this video
The ferrari i would have it
Porsche is fast
SVJ ALL DAY It dominates the Nurburgring which is what matters.
812 Superfast, exact same spec
Porsche!!!
Silent killers don't make noise - porsche
Lamboo
Dont know why Porsche did an electric car at all - they already had a fast car saying absolutely nothing 😳
ferrari started late on the first and early on the second
Ferrari Superfast, more like SuperSlow
Porsche
I will take Ferrari
Ferrari
Thank you for not being a sheep and getting an iPhone
The porsche is the best all rounder and the fastest 0-100. But Turning up in that ferrari to a restaurant or mates house does make a bigger statement. Tough one.
Imagine paying 360000 pounds to get smoked by a 911 half the price in every test 😂😂w over 200 less hp. Id take the Porsche any day
Porsche all day
Lamborghini
porsche and ferrari has less max speed than Lamborghini so in the end lambo wins.. lambo all day every day....
Ferrari
The 911 is The Best
Despite being significantly cheaper. The Porsche was in a class if it's own.
Obviously there is a replacement for displacement 😂
Ferrari 🏎!
Always the same with Yianni and his shitty Lamborghinis 😂😂😂
911 turbo S all the way
How did the Porsche win ?!!
The Ferrari sounds good. But Lamborghini’s sound so brutal, they ruin all other V12’s for me.
812superfast
The 911 all the way!!
Porsche very day!
That lambo gear box sucks compared to Ferrari's and Porsche's
Ferrari👌🏾
Ferri then svj then porche
Porsche and day
Uhm the Ferrari
Ferrari is legend, lambo is brutal, but porsche is the one i will buy- German work is the best
Ok the panda joke on the ferrari was really funny🤣🤣
There is no substitute🇩🇪🇩🇪
I'm love lomborgini
A Porsche always gonna be the king and no need to be loud, always shouting mouths out with the power of a "S" letter.
Really, you have to ask? PORSCHE
TURBO S
Lambo is the only head Turner here
Lambo forever
911 Turbo S all day!!
That frigging Porsche made a mess of those two.
I love the turbo s
I’m an 80’s baby, so the Lamborghini SVJ is the purest example of what we all thought a super/hyper-car is supposed to be: unapologetically loud in volume, unapologetically loud in design, powerful and so fast that it looks like it’s doing 50mph while sitting at a stop light. A mechanical arrogance, if you will. But when compared to the 911 Turbo S, it’s definitely hubris.
Please don’t forget to call you when you can come over to my house 🏡 morning tomorrow
The Porsche is the best car!
i would have the ferarri
Based solely on appearance, definitely the Ferrari
Ferrari looks better
It was the Porsche... if it was straight piped
Is it the Stig driving the porsche?
Ferrari
I'd prefer the Porsche
I would get the farrari
I was expecting both the Lamborghini and the Porsche to beat the Ferrari (both are AWD while the 812 is RWD), but I really wasn't expecting the 911 to beat the Aventador (both are AWD, but the SVJ is lighter and has more power). Man, that Porsche is a beast.
lambo and ferrari sound great but the porsche took te race hahahah
‘cheesy buggah’
Lambo
Porsche 911 Turbo
its unfair, the porsche is designed by germans
Ferrari sounds best
Think about it, its not even a GT2 RS. If porsche were a weapon, it definitely be a silenced sniper rifle
I would get the Porsche, you can daily drive it as well, unlike the insane teenager cars and it's faster and it's cheaper.
Yianni jumped and the porsche still won
Im from Italy so i should say Ferrari or Lambo ( i love both)  But im sorry, Porsche is King
Porsche to experience the best
Lamborghini avanterdor
One day i will have all these cars😎
Porsche is the Daddy of both the other "super cars"
812
WHICH WOULD I OWN MONEY NO OBJECT....the one I bought...911 Turbo S, and then I used the money I saved to upgrade the the car to 1100 horsepower 😂😂😂  #DailyDriver9.3ET car ;-) and the Inconel exhaust fixed the sound problem haha
I’d take the Porsche any day out of these 3 a lot of people underestimate Porsche
812 🤘🏼
Freaking Porsche but don’t get fool by the sound,it will perform better
Jeez that Ferrari revs like LFA
Sorry Matt... Lamborghini for ever...it's brutal!!!!
German accent was p spot on
He thanked that lambo then lol
Porsche 911
PORSCHE for the win every time!!!!! Can get a Porsche much cheaper than Ferrari and Lamborghini with much more affordable maintenance and mods......... Ferrari and Lamborghini really are over-rated and Porsche isn't given enough credit. BOXTER all the way!!!!
I will take......🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 the Porsche
Mat Watson, try with Bugatti Chiron or Konssesag ragera
Porsche won sound test
l would take the Lambo, all day, errday
Porsche easy. eyes, brain, and heart all say Porsche
id be happy with any one of the 3 :)
Porsche: Keep barking!!
Stop with the accents they are God awful
I would like the porsche
I would take the Porsche “All Day, Any Day, Every Day” 😜 And at least get a louder aftermarket exhaust!
Proof that the old, "there is no replacement for displacement" saying no longer applies.
Lambo = Best Looks Ferrari = Best Sound Porsche = Best Overall
Ferrari by far!!!
812 SF
lambergini SVJ
Liebe Grüße aus Stuttgart an der Stelle
Definitely Ferrari. If you want the fastest car, it's an F1 car. For the road it is all about experience. The Lambo it too uncomfortably, the Porsche lacks literally everything but speed.
It annoys me that Yanny always does so well in his Lamborghini’s because I love Ferrari.
Mat sounded like Lil Yachy when he talked in German😂😂😂
Novitec nlargo 812 super fast
Why does this guy get so hyped when he comes second? bro a car that cost half the price just beat you.
lambo aventador svj
I'd have the 992 honestly.
Definitely SVJ, sorry Matt
Porsche driver now wath is duing
It doesn't matter what the car looks like except results ✌😅
Ferrari sounds best
Allways Porsche, what else 😎
812 for sure
I would honestly have the Ferrari
Porsche so comfortable and so good much better than a Lamborghini or ferrari
812👌
porsche have half engine and the other two are having hard time to beat it. talking about efficiency, right?
why Porsch? why not Ferrar? Or Lamborghin? I still don't get it why there is no english speaking cartester out there, to say it in the right way : PorschE. Must be a real tongue-twister.
Porshe 911 turbo s
omg. 911 beating everything. i thought in this class svj is the best. but......
Yani should be in movies
The will of lambo is awd
these videos are amazing 👍
Bb
Porsche quality
I'll make that Porche look like a VW Beatle in a Bugatti Chiron. Or would I buy my neighborhood, hmmm?
Porsche
where do you get a 911 turbo s for 162k pounds show me i buy 10
Porsche is the king
Svj
Black Ferrari, looks german cars, supercars :D
I’d get the 911 Turbo S. Lol sorry but it’s the overall better car.
The unknown Driver says: "Hey poser, what's your name? Superfast? 😆
Porsche
Porche 911 s it's better than Ferrari superfast
Porsche 911 Turbo S  🦾
Respect to German and really appreciate they actually control the sound. Thank you. Because the worst thing is a jerk who likes to show off his car sound in our neighborhood when there are families having babies. Even you have a loud car, please try to be considerate when driving around housing area. By the way, i love my panamera..smooth sound not too loud.
PORSCHE DEFINETELY THE BEST
Porsche, with 100 HP less WON cool
Abentador
Lamborghini SVJ
Money no object, Ferrari.
Lambo all day every day
Money no object id take the porsche.... Lambo is too much for me.... But money is an object on subject so i dont think ill have any of them...
Dont sleep on Grandaddy Porsche
I'm not a Porsche guy at all. But a Porsche just like it did a 10.1 sec quarter mile in your other video. I'm a speed freak. So Porsche for me. Watching it beat the 720s in the other video was astounding.
I'm going Porsche all the way
Surely the Porsche
Porsche 911 Turbo S for sure...
Bro do pedal shift becuse its has more twerq in pedal shoft
Lambo all day everyday
The intro tho lmaooo
Ferrari 812
What🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
this has top gear energy
I prefer Lamborghini all day every day😂🤣
Porche better car Ferrari better looking
Ferrari  for sure
Porsche is my choice
Porche all time was like:  two fools sure did keep themselves company.
812 😍
Porsche is king!!!!!🤴🤴🤴
The Porsche because I can make Lamborghini and Ferrari owners look silly with little stoplight blasts 😂😂😂
Always Porsche nothing more 🤜🤛
😂😂😂😂😂 That Schnitzel spank those Pizzas 🙈
Ferrari all day
Can please do a drag race of 10th gen civic si coupe vs 350z not nismo vs Mazada mx5
How to define PORSCHE BEAST AND BEAUTY!!! OUTSTANDING LIGHTNING KILLER PERFORMANCE AGAINST THOSE THUNDER LOUD EXHAUST.LOL
Lamborghini
I say Porsche
That Porsche is from out of the world 😱
Ferrari
Turbo S every time
Hope at least the Porsche has the steering wheel on the right side (left)
12:03 porshe
That 812 looks so good
Ferrari & Lamborghini: shower and poser cars, Porsche: actual fast stealthy car :)
Lambo jumped and 911 still killed IT. <3 <3 <3 911 forever! <3 <3 <3
Ferrari all Ferrari!!!
I feel like joining you guys.  You guys are awesome. ❤️ #carwow
I would have the Porsche and put some mods, also Ferrari sounds the best, Lambo is the loudest.
Proud of Porsche
911 every day of the week !!
911
German Engineering 💪🏻
The Porsche just looks like a sport car 😂
6:06 Porsche badge: "am I a joke to you?"
Porsche All day any day
I'd have 2 Porsches for 1 lambo svj and still save few thousand pounds
Porsche is king
Oh my god I think the only thing faster then that Porsche is a Tesla that car 911 turbo s is fast as hell😫
ferrari 812
Porsch
Svj
Lambo
Porsche
Porsche 911 Turbo S for me
Hai saya orang Indonesia
svj hands downnnnnn
I'll take the 911 turbo S any day .
Porsche: Today's lesson is: Dogs that bark don't bite.
Porsche turbo s every time what a wonderful car, just Ama-zing
Porsche
911 turbo for me.. it's just all round the best car and not in your face low key
I’d get the Porsche any day and add an e 63 s for the remaining money
The Ferrari is the best looking and most desirable car!
812's design is just Timeless...i'm a Porsche guy but if (as you say) money was no object, i'd love to own this Ferrari, Golden ratio symbolize beauty with it's mad long hood and short tail and crazy yet simple interior <3
Ferrari ,☄️🇵🇰🤩
F8 vs Turbo S plz.
I love Lambos and If money is no object definitely a Lambo but I must admit my favourite car and has been for years is the porsche 911 turbo
Ferrari is better looking
You guys doesnt k how to drive those cars:/
Why does Yanni always jump.every.single.time?
🤓😂😂😂😂😂
Ferrari rear wheel drive
So you guys doing almost 300 km\h runs with tyre pressures as low as 2.2... Come on...
Horses are faster than bulls
Porsche
I think the Porsche is the best!
The rarri looks the best to me because it reminds me of a black mamba and it’s nice
lamborghini for the win in sound and evey thing elce
The lamborghini sounds the best. And I think it is gonna win.
OK that was my bad
Who is my who cares about the porches
Ferrari
Porsche 911 Turbo S is my car :)
Bring the mclarin 765lt
Porsche, what else, 💪👌
5:07 hahahahahahahahha
Lamborghini because I could sell and buy two porsche 911 turbos s
Porsche always the best 🇩🇪❤️
Would have the ferrari if I had an extra car but porsche if it was my only car
Yanni cheats off the line!!
German cars power ! Boxer engine !
Impressionante como a Porsche transpira competência. Se conseguisse resolver esse ronco de aspirador, certamente conquistaria mais corações do que já conquista.
The svj is not rare at all you can find hundreds for sale rn
Porsche. Too reliable and proven to change it for anything else. Plus what you get for the price is not a match for any other super car.
That Porsche is fucking bonkers holly shit
Lambos are soo over-rated i swear😂
WAAAAY too many shoutouts and sponsor mentions and personal adverts in the middle of whats supposed to be a flagship flatout shootout. Cut that out out we all just forward over it really kills the tension and just make with the cars. Put it at the end or as a marked segment in the start.
I’d choose Porsche anytime.
I liked the video just for the accents.
Ferrari
Porsche let my winning make all the noise 🎉🙏
Porsche all day everyday!
For me the Ferrari is the most beautiful, so I'd take the Ferrari any day, everyday.
OMG I can't stand the Harris-O'Biden ads. Pathetic.
OMG you killed it on the intro accents.. ! I was literally laughing out loud !!
damn that porsche really pulls
Porsche the best
I mean the 812 and the SVJ are both amazing cars, but you where I live you practically couldnt own these cars because no matter where you park them someone is gonna vandalize your car or sit on it for a fucking Instagram photo. The Porsche is quicker, quieter and just overall way more inconspicuous.
I would love to have the 911 it's just simple and beautiful
The all black farrari looks menising in sun!!!
Porsche best
Porsche <3
Beaning it after 2 cheater
Bloke in the ferrari beaning it after 2 and still fucking it
Dang that Porsche is fast
hey mate. have you tried to override the soft limiter by setting the gearbox in N?
Definately Porsche amazing I don’t know why you didn’t talked much about Porsche in the video that’s beaten both of you so easily like 🐇 to 🐢
A ese Ferrari le falta chofer.
I know everyone will say the Porsche turbo s or the Lambo but deep down we all know every one of us would choose the Ferrari 812 with that N/A V12 screaming engine and unbeatable prestige that would make everyone feel like a race car driver!! More Yianny Videos Now!!!
Yanni shouting "COME ON" is the best thing ever. Oh and I'd have a 720S.... 😆
Porsche ❤️
Porsche 911 turbo s
Yann needs to stay off this channel
That porsche is fucking retarded how is it that it’s destroying these poor v12’s like it’s nothing, I love it
Ferrari - the Classic guy who is just a powerful gentlemen Lambo - psychic show off dude who is always load everywhere  Porsche - arrogant smart dude who is the best in physics   I’ll take the Ferrari, sounds more balanced and fun to me
svj in not a beatiful car by any standards,yanni must still be 10 in the head?
Ferrari Is way better
When a Ferrari or Lamborghini salesperson gives me sales pitch, I'll show them this video.
I am a simple man. I see a Porsche, I click.
Heads up 4 Porsche
While Mat and Yianni are racing eachother the Porsche be like "Eyy yo guys where ya at? You comin soon?"
Mat Watson is the best
Porsche You look the best
Porsche 911 Turbo S
The "S" stands for Superman, or Superwoman - whatever you prefer.
the best thing is put those cares on Spa and see the best time track... acelerate in an airport dont proves that much
Svj
Porsche rules , enough said ....
only for the looks already
obvious the porsche
Lamborghini
Ferrari  or porches id have yanni bye bye 😆
I would have the Ferrari, it looks like a Batmobile
Ferrari 812 superfast
Porsche 🇩🇪
Porsche
Porche
l
6 ads later.... why just why
U better not challenge a porsche and a lambo.. They will just kill the shitt ferrari.. Its one shittiest cars ever seen..
The porche be zoomin’
Deutsche Qualität...
Porsche I love porsche from heart
Porsche for sure.... It made the lambo and f The Ferrari look like babies
The first 20 seconds I thought there was a problem with my ears
Porsche the best
0:59 yianni be like  Lambo without me
Ich meine offensichtlich......
Ahaha those people saying I'd take a Lambo, then sell it, get a Porsche and a house instead are probably some kind "home appliance" drivers...and are clearly missing the point here...Ferraris and Lambos (and Lotus for that matter) have never been the fastest cars - Bugattis and others are out there for this job. As the connoisseurs know too well, it's all about the experience, becoming part of an exclusive world made of history, racing competitions, oozing real passion for the mechanics and craftmanship; it's all about the intoxicating scent of petrol, leather interiors and of course about the raucus, primordial engine and exhaust roar. This is what people pay extra money for, living the dream.
I would definitely have the Porsche ❤️
Porsche... always Porsche. No fancies, no bullshit. Das Auto!
Best sound, Ferrari.  Which would I buy? Ferrari.
wow Porsche just killed it!
Ferrari looks the best. But Porsche is love!
Add a twin turbo in that Lambo and the porsche is DONE
Porsche
Lamborghinis are slow a corrvette will will kick but
DEUTSCHE PORSCHE POWER
What a phenomenal race. The noise 🔥
Jķķķķkkjjkkkj
Porsche 911 turbo s is the best car ever!
porsche simple the besttttttttt   in the worldddddddddddddddddddd
Anyone think Matt should get a Chiron doing a drag race
Every time that Lambo shifted the Porsche gapped it just a little more
ciaoo ;))))
Theres is notthing better than Porsche. #Porsche#love#forever
Thank you for making this video. I've had a conversation with my brother who said that Porsche is so normal and slow- after finishing that sentence I've showed him this one...
Always loved the 911 no matter what, but that 812 I have to say HAS to be my mistress....that thing just looks beautiful.....
Porsche anyday
Definitely the Porsche
I’m rewatching this video and it seems someone’s gone absolutely bonkers with the ‘how many ads do you want?’ Button...
The new  992 Turbo S its a Killer! Its just Perfect.
The lambo
Nothing sounds like a LAMBORGHINI ❤️❤️💥
Clearly the Proche sounded the best.😂
Porsche = Quiet assassin.
I'll def get the Porsche, but I would of gone with the gtr2 turbo version which would of smoked both them
Waiting for a day that Yianni doesn’t jump the gun
I would want the posche 911 S
Yes I was people out there who think that posche cannot make it we are the best 911
Porsche 911 Turbo S is my dream car ❤️
Where is Porsche Panamera???
Porsche anyday even though I am a die hard lambo fan.....but that car with 3.8L 650bhp and 1500 and some kgs bests lambo and Ferrari..........man that's some out the world shit.  I mean everything is against Porsche except 800nm of torque.....  WOW
lamborgini and ferrari has the best sound
Porsche : The Silent Assasin
I'd have the Porsche for everyday driving and the Ferrari for the fun weekends because of the V12 sound!!
Porsche really surprised me it’s crazy
The lambo
Safe and sound
Ferrari Superfast definitely most beautiful
💯Lambo Svj for sure✅
The bull didn’t beat the horse Yanni , it didnt.
Ferrari has the superior design
German👌
911 Turbo S, what else?
Porsche without a doubt
Lambo is the king of all kings
The best and true piece of art is Porsche  911 Turbo S
Ferrari
Ferrari
Porsche engine has sound of a hairdryer.
💯💣💨Germany_cars_💯💣
What is a Porsch'?
Porsche
Haven't watched the video yet but my instinct from years of professional racing experience...playing Forza Horizon...the Lambo and the Porsche AWDs should destroy the RWD 812.
Porsche all day every day
would take the porsche too
812
ferrari
It is all about german engenering
Porsche
Porsche
Please have a Drag Race between Porsche 911 Turbo S Vs. Ford GT. Let's see who wins. MY MONEY IS ON THE FORD GT
Germany wins
Porsche all day every day
Anyone drive his car before.......what did he say next?  Porshe is like apple, you don't look at the horsepower specs.
It boggles my mind how porsche can do so good with such a small engine.
If I really had enough money I would get the 812 superfast
Technically and quality wise, the Porsche is BY FAR the best car. Btw. who' s the Porsche Driver?  Why sound only testing outside? Inside it sounds much better.  The test was clearly biased...
2 Volkswagensvs one ferrari😂
The lambo looked better
Believe it or not, Porsche 911 is the best Sportscar. Look at the best lap times on the legendary Nürburgring. The 911 is also a timeles beauty.
I'll take the lambo🤯😂 But the pursche is better🤯💣
Porsche is the Chuck Norris of the auto world. #JustSaying
porsche everyday, understated class
8:14 lol
I don't like gambling ,but the roulette tatoo looks cool
Wir bauen halt die besten Autos
What the hell made the Porsche faster? Its half the engine of those cars
Ferrari 😍😍😍 Pista or F8 f...k's everyone
That was actually some awesome accent impressions
Porsche are the best rn
Lol. Let's try this again when the new GT2 arrives.
It's just impressive how that Porsche spanks this Italian super cars in every area but the sound. But who cares about the sound? As long as you can spank your neighbor's Ferrari and Lambo.
Porsche 💪💪💪💪💪💪
Hey Matt, Christmas is around the corner so I’ll take the 992. 911 Porsche Turbo  in Silver!!
The PORSCHE is definitely a KNIFE in a GUNFIGHT...it reminds of the character SOAP in LOCK,STOCK and TWO SMOKING BARRELS, the PORSCHE is that small obsedian knife that  can actually skin a crocodile with relative ease.
That Lamborghini is just loud lol
Dude driving the lambo is wild 😂
Why is Matt’s German impression so high pitched?
The Italian stable has veins and eyes popping! Meanwhile the Porsche quietly goes about its business and beats both the others in pretty much all tests. I’d have the Porsche all day long and stick the other £100K in my pocket. Sweet😁
Can we just have a moment for how well balanced porsche is, and for half of the price.
Ferrari 🔥❤
Lambo❤️❤️
Porsche 991 turbo s
I’ve always been a Porsche guy so... The Porsche 911 Turbo S for me
5:05 the face I make when my friend acts weirdly  and have to pretend I don't know him
If that lambo had dual clutch gearbox's Porsche would gone
PORSCHE. Unbelievably fast, shocked at that race.
Porsche is the older brother that has to play with his little brothers because his mum said so
porsche sounds better😂🤣🤣🤣
Ah yes, Porsche🥰
Porsche!
911 all day every day
Svj sounded better but the Porsch was that one sibling that u have when he gets in to trouble
PORSCHE= Actions Speaks louder than Words!💪
Porsche Killer everybody
It is electric
I love Italian Ferrari Pininfarina it is fast it has 1877bhp
I think the Ferrari is going to beat the Lamborghini
The Porsche is a better looking car in my opinion I would take it over the other 2 any day it just has the classic look
Porsche, italian car killer
NASCAR
I would hav porsch for sure
Porsche be like : am i a joke to you guys?
I will definitely get Lamborghini svj
Everything looks stupid compare to porsche
I'm a Lamborghini fan, but Deutsche Marke...  Porsche 💪😍
Ferrari is love 💘 ❤
I LOVE​ SVJ​
@carwow This along with @throttlehouse is without a doubt my two best channels on here. Complete blend of humor and intelligence. I love these guys
Svj
Porsche is just perfection.
Yanni jumped the start and left on 2 not 1 and the Porsche is the clear winner and always will be
Porsche all day. Everyday super car
Porsche takes it. But I think the Ferrari sounds better for once
Imagine if that svj would have dual clutch.
SVJ
Goddamn Porsche, Goddamnnn
Easily the 812 as long as it's not in chav done good spec. It looks fucking awful here.   The 812 looks amazing in either Grigio Silverstone or Grigio Ferro with white wheels and a black interior (little to no Alcantara).   Looks awesome here as tested by Motorweek: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOZhmcakDRU
Ferrari miles way, look stunning,  sound better, and rolling race smash then all
Yianni doesn't give a shit who beats him as long as its not mat
Damn #Porsche is like Small packet big Surprise.
Lambo all day everyday!!
Nothing sounds better than that Ferrari!!!!!!!!!!!!
I would have the lambo if it had dual clutch
The svj was shooting flames
I’d like to buy the Jaguar F-Type SVR or Porsche 911 Turbo S.
I will definitely get the porche😂
Woooooooow
Jk
Bich
Why audi R8 isn’t there coz i think last time i saw video R8 beat all of them.
Lamborghini Lamborghini Lamborghini!!!
Never ever Porsche he is more sageous...in these segmeny mat love you.wistful Omnipotent god bless you man
Ferrari 💥
Can we just take a moment to respect the way Porsche got 650hp out of a 3.8L l6. Amazing.
My neighbor thinks the Porsche has the best sound
Svj
Lambo looks better . But in a better colour would be my choice
Lambo is best looking, Porsche is fast and more usable , Ferrari is nahhhh @12:50 :D :D
Definitely the 911 S turbo
Quel "ciao, bella!" Mi ha traumatizzato..
So if you want a fast car regardless of sound buy a Porsche and save your money 💰
911 or superfast
Porsche hands down. "It does what it says on the tin!"
I’ll take Porsche for sure way better to use as daily and fast as shit much cheaper and looks so fun to drive
Porche
Lambo sound better then that
Porsche all day everyday Mat mate
Should’ve brought a Tesla smh
Can you please do Bugatti drag race?
That intro got a like from me lol
911 porsche
Love that Italian German thing in the beginning ❤️❤️❤️
Porshe!
Porsche forsure
Porche definitely
911 for the win
Long ass adds wtf
I would ALWAYS have the FERRARI!!!!
ALWAYS FERRARI sounds BEST!!!
Yanni always jumps the start
Lambo
the 812 superfast sounded the best
i've did some research and there were 80 812 syperfast made is that correct
Porsche
Yanis’ reactions are the funniest thing lol
Porsche any day
You two have THE BEST PERSONALITIES on the entire Internet, I could feel your excitement and depth of loss for you both...as if I was actually there...keep em coming!  Thank you, brightened my whole day...maybe week!
La Ferrari nn vince mai
Porsche all day.
"C'mon  Get FRU"😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ferrari sounded better
I´d buy the aventador, sell it, and buy a gts2 Porsche for that money
Porsche every day. Better value. Better car.
omg. 3.8 thats all you need PORSCHE! <3
Porsche, without a doubt hands down my choice.
Porsche is the one that I would have. I appreciate the fact they do more with less and don't kill your pocket book(compared to the other two) Especially since you can have some extra money to spend. I mean more than pocket change buy a house or a good down payment. And beauty is subjective, too.
Matt your skin is really bad-have you eve done drugs ??
Not the muskim
Scusa ma come parli in italiano ahahahahah
I would  take the ferrari
That Porsche is exactly why I'm buying one. That thing is SO busted. You can be as loud as you want, speed is what matters most.
Yani needs to be in a fast and furious movie. He’s got that legit aggression like he’s racing for pinks.
lambo.355
Porsche 911 all day everyday 🙌🏾
SVJ sound very jolly 🤭
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Svj 😍
The language 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I would go Lamborghini adventador svj
Am confused
How did the Porsche win
porsche sounds fire :)
I would have the lambogini
Ferrari
Porsche says: You can make the noise, but I'll beat you quietly.
The porsche is absolutely stupid, in the best way possible. Porsche engineers really must practice witchcraft
10:28 ooof that foot on the door panel
Now i know why Huawei chose Porsche for it's most premium phonee
Ferrari
Porsche Porsche Porsche . The other two do nothing for me
Porsche is stupid fast that’s amazing
How fucking awesome are Mats accents
I'll take the porsche
Ferrari sounds mutch better
Why the lamborghini company will never build a not natural ASPRITED engine?
Porsche
i love the 911 turbo s
If the aventador had a dual clutch transmission, it would kill.
Well I won’t get the Porsche. Am getting the Ferrari because I don’t care
Porscheeeee😘😘😘😘
Porsche
Porsche for sure!
lamborghini sounds good
This is ferarri vs Lamborghini, with the Porsche documenting the race.
Porsche, quite as fvck, beat all round, n let them win in the last round 😂
Ferrari sounded the best by far for me! It sounds like God getting angry at you for committing a sin! I wish I had the money lol
I'd rather have the Porsche... such a great well engineered car ... just wow 😶
Porsche cheapest and probably the most reliable. Plus can be used everyday
Instead of buying a lambo svj..i will go on for porsche 911 turbo S and GT-R R35 ❤
812 superfast... And by the way ferrari sounds much better
That Porsche cutting all types of ass
Six banger is a Beast 😁
Who’s in Lamborghini? 😂
E eu brincando de motor fire 1.4
The Beetle won, imagine that!
911 turbo
Porsche
I like the porsche
The Porsche is the much more sensible car, but I still want the Aventador
https://youtu.be/z5vNHTl_71k
Damn,that Porsche is fast as hell
I’m a Porsche fanboy.  Nothing else compares.
Porsche
Porsche 911🤩🖤
Ferrari 🥵
I'd have the Porsche!!
Porshe <3
Next time mclaren senna
Did this mans really upbadge an SVJ??
3:38 revving & drag race begins ✌🏼
Each time I watch this drag race I fear for matts life
Why is he racing the Lambo in Strada mode? I want to see this race with the Lambo in Corsa mode like it's supposed to be, and then we'll see what happens.
Super fast any day of the week but you have to give the souped up beetle a round of applause, lambo nice tho. Great show love the drag races
The Ferrari just needs a driver is what happened, Mat.
The sweat pants fit perfectly in that Lamborghini..
performance and price taken out, i would go for the porsche... otherwise better get the lambo, sell it in 5 years for a cool half mill and get a gt3rs or the new 911 turbo s then...
🔥 812 superfast VS 720s 🔥
Porsche...there is no substitute.
I just love when Matt losses I freaking love when Matt wins against yiaini
Ferrari Sound best 😍👍
Can we get a race between the Ferrari F8 Tributo vs Ferrari 488 Pista
Porsche
I'm Lamborghini fan through and through, but mad respect to the porsche engineers that 911 is a MONSTER
Ferrari 812 superfast my dream babe is sounds the bloody better
This man jumped the start and still came in second
I will have the ferrari 812 superfast
Would you bring us some hypercars to race
12:12 Ferrari looks heaps better.
Will have to go with the Porsche..
Porche is ugly but very capable Lambo is beauty but ok Ferrari is angry buy so so
Still looks like a squashed beetle.  - butthurt lambo fan.
Sure i would have the porsche
Yanni ALWAYS, IN EVERY RACE, IN EVERY CAR, starting early, ALWAYS ruins it for me. Please stop.
Porsche all the way Matt
11:38 XD
😂😂😂😂 the German accent waz dope
I like how Yanni said " Lambo Does Really Well Against That Porsche Considering We All Know What Porsche Is All About".
Aventador SVJ
I'd take the 812 Superfast since I love grand tourers esp. ones with a screaming NA V12.
Porsche is better that all your crap cars
Ferrari f18
Porsche can be louder with an exhaust right?
Porsche
ferrari
The Porsche could have  just be used as a camera car showing the other two cars race
Ferrari looks neatest, but for sure most impressed with Porsche
Viva le Porsche..... haha
Ferrari
I want the porsche
Porsche!!!!! All day everyday!!
That 911 Turbo is insane, 👏👏👏
ferrari and lambo
porch is my pick
Porsche is the best looking car lol
Porch
M8 I’ve driven all three, Ferrari, Lambo and Porsche. I found the former two more of a track type car, not an everyday driver and this is why the Porsche does it for me all day long. Plus, there’s something about German build quality which always supersedes the Italians, just my two pennies worth...
And my guess isssssssss!?!?!?!!?Yhe porche is gonna Walk em!!Mayne I'm wrong but Don't think so bwahahaha!I'll bet one PayPal dollar if I'm wrong!Anyone wana gamble for that Whole Dollhair!?😄
The Lamborghini would of smashed the line
Porsche
Porsche 🇩🇪
Porsche Turbo
Try sport mode in Ferrari it drops to 4th should have been 3rd, once moving Porche is slowing vs Superfast unless chipped
I'll have the Ferrari, no question. I was at a Maserati dealer that had an Aventador on the floor. Both salesmen said it drove terribly compared to the Ferraris (in the dealer across the street). Porsche is nice, but not in the same club as Ferrari, despite it's performance.  There's only one car with the historical and current pedigree, and it's not the tractor company or admittedly special 911..  it's Ferrari.
I wanna Porsche so bad 🥺
Powiem tyle o moim ulubionym aucie. Rozpęd ma zawsze ale to zawsze lepszy ale rozpęd od 100-200 czy od 200-300 ma zawsze gorszy to mnie smuci
Lambo svg.  Seen one in person. Stunning car
porsche there is no substitute confidently slaying those dragons
The Lamborghini did my favourite sound
Porsche shitting on everything...
Watching videos like these makes me proud to say I work for Porsche👊🏻
Can we have a conversation about the porsche though.
0:11 he was pretty accurate about winning
does anyone noticed that the lambo wasnt in sport mode or corsa mode? i think he can win the races in the corsa or sport mode
porsche
Ferrari
the porsche  is a silent killer
Bad boys for life porsche anyday.....🔥🔥
If you want to be looked at and heard, get the Lambo. If you want to destroy everyone on the track, get the Porsche.
Ferrari:- super fast
That Lambo sound first made my face crunch up and then smile like an imbecile! OH MY GOD <3
That why i love porsche and my dream car is taycan turbo s
The porsche 911 turbo s is a better value than these other cars
Ferrari 812
911 super
Porsche 911 Turbo us the best car ever
The Porsche is so quick. Every time, it destroys every car. Still I would buy the SVJ since it's a Lambo, not anything else. It produces a special feeling.
the porsche.
Excellence Was Expected...
ferrari812 superfast
I knew the Porsche was the best car in that drag race. Sorry Matt and Yanni but it is a fact!!!
The Lambo sounded the best. For the Porsche though I would have thought you were revving a diesel engine if I'd not known which car it was.
812
A 720s with a capable driver would kill all of them!
Porsche 911t s
Porsche: "awww look the little kids are racing each other having fun."  Edit: this reply section is amazing
That lineup of 3 cars has more horsepower than all the cars in my street combined.
Porsche definitely sounds the best
Wait for the gto
ferrrari
Lamborghini sounds insane 😱
now thats why i love porche
Lol but honestly I lied, SVJ BBY
Ferrari 812
Porsche!
YEEESSSSSS PORSCHE 911 TURBO S ALL THE WAY BABY      !
ALWAYS SAY NOTHING CAN MATCH GERMAN PERFORMANCE ENGINEERING AT ALL    !
812 is my dream car.
保时捷天下无敌
812 superfast vs avendator svj vs gt2rs
and looks best, personally
ferrari sounds the best
The Ferrari is the better looking car
Ferrari ofc !!
I prefer the Porsche sound. Like stfu farting around at 3am
No matter what any other company comes up with, porsche will beat it with a new version of this same fkin car which is really damn disappointing.
DAMN that LAMBO EXHAUSTTTTTT
The impressions were spot on!
@carwow  that porsche was fast but i would have to go with the lambo svj sorry matt but it looked better and sounded better
No body care about that little engine 😅
I thought he said it’s Adam Watson from the car wash. Anyone else
911 ezz
911 killed it.  But i don't understand. Why would i buy lambo (which is my favorite) if i can't beat a Porsche.
911 turbo S
Porsche is the best 😜
I'd have the Lambo. Then I'd sell it and buy the 911, a motor home, a Land Rover and a garage to keep them all in 😂
PORSCHE 😍😍
I'd take the Porsche since they build the best cars now adays
Lamborgini svj
Porsche, do well on track and you can drive it to work---
I am sure that drive ( handling, cornering) would be better too in Porsche..... this turbo S is a one of a kind thing..
I have the ferrari
This video was de-monetized due to Matt putting on stereotypical Italian/German accents. I'm genuinely surprised nobody thought that it may be offensive to some people. Its not like Matt is a 19yr old YouTuber & Carwow is a obscure little channel.
That Porsche gearbox is flawless
svj sounds the best
100% lambo
Porsche
Lambo sound my best
Ferrari says: I m the best 💪 Lamborghini says: I will win✌️  Meanwhile Porsche " You farting donkeys" 😂😂😂
Uses foot to open Ferrari door 10:27
Ferrari812 Superfast one love
Porsche ist halt deutsche Wertarbeit und Performance und nicht nur laut und auf dicke Hose
Ferrari
Can't you just keep the text with HP and NM in the bottom, instead of only showing it for one car at the time and then erase it?
911))) one love, masterpeace of engineering!
Porsche says: You can make the noise, but I'll beat you quietly.
https://youtu.be/YX_TKWh6GKA
Laambo SVJ
Ferrari best looking
Farari 812 super fast
I don’t know why but Yanni brings me so much joy
It is always great to watch a Porsche Turbo S go up against what should be the best of the best. The German manufacturer simply makes a useable perfect car that can beat hypercars. The 911 Turbo S has to be the best car as an all-round car. Well done Porsche.
Porsche
Porsche from beginnen. GUTE DEUTSCHE WERKSARBEIT
Why you Saxon people can't say  PorschE?? Ist Porsche, not porsch or porch or pork!
Ferrari 812
Lambo looks the coolest and I’d love to have it but Porsche is better 😂
MANL
Cool
Porsche always
For one day Lambo! For one week Ferrari!   For one year Porsche!
Lamborghini
the 992 is easily the hottest car there. simple, curvy and just a beast on the road.
Lambo exhaust are the besttt. Porsche and lambo for me.
Porsche is just their like, look at this foolss
Ok like always, Ferrari: Incredible, beautiful, super, but never wins!
Porsche 911 Turbo S is just insane, still a lot of money but compared to other cars, worth it
I would love have Porsche 911 Turbo S
Turbo S FTW
Superfast for sure. Aka THE SCOOPMOBIEL
LAMBO!
xd
PORSCHE! WALK SOFTLY AND CARRY TWIN TURBSKIES!!!!😁😁😁😁🏁🍺🍺
Scroll down for Porsche fanboys watering on that keyboard!
Definitely the PORSCHE
I'd rather have the Porsche mat I really actually like it
The lambo forever! 😘
Lamburgini and Ferrari have good design good body but Porshe is No1 for speed 😀🚀 Germany
The Porsche is the nicest design and as we can see the best as well. WELL DONE PORSCHE!!!!!!!
Lamborghini
*Without Turbo, Porsche is only a nice Tatra*
911 hands down
Porsche
The Porsche smoke them despite being the least powerful
The 911 delivers like stink, love it
That Porsche is unbelievable... I think it is because of the PDK gearbox... which is the best in the world under my opinion..
I want the porsche
Porsche....”I’ll just get up front & film you 2 kids having your battle for 2nd & 3rd” 😂
For a second in the intro I thought I was watching car wow Italy but then I saw mat in his usual face
This Superfast is a thing of beauty
I don't care what the Porsche could do it's so ugly
Wow I thought the Porsche would have won by a further distance. Lambo looks sound drama nothing comparable
I'd have that brutal sleeper Porsche over the others any day
If i was 12,the Lambo. Porsche all day long.
1000 hp supra vs supercars .. COMON :D
Porsche is that ugly guy who takes all the beautiful girls😂
Porsche is just the best and most beautiful car of these three
Unpopular opinion: The Turbo S doesn't sound that bad. I believe it has a soft limiter when it's still, that cuts the engine at 3-4k RPM or so. It actually sounds ok with the sports exhaust.  It's clearly the better car from an engineering standpoint, but of course it doesn't have the drama or the excitement of the Italians.
And this was just a drag race. Every car can go fast on a straight road. On the track the Porsche will be A LOT faster than these two "hypercars"
Lamborghini in for Kids, Porsche is for men
This is just about the Lambo and the Ferrari...Porsche was just entertaining the two young chaps
Ferrari all day every day!
Where the SVJ shines is on the track. Not as a drag racer.
I would still get a Ferrari tho.
Porshe slilent but very fast 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🌋
I would absolutely have the Porsche 911 TS 👍
Lambo🔥🔥🔥
I would definitely have the Porsche
That Porsche
SVJ
I'll have the Porshe over and over please
Yanni jumped the start btw
Ferrari
And the lambo was not in the race mode9:02
BUT MY FAVOURITE CAR IS    LAMBO
Porsche all the day
Some one needs to dyno that freakin porsher!!! Otherwish id take that rari
Lombo
Whatever porsche was smoking when they designed the car, I would like some
Porsche. The Lambo is too.... bling. Kind of tasteless and Ferraris are over rated and not that good *cough cough 2020 f1 team* Sure the Porsche isn't the most exciting to look at or listen too but it goes the best! Understated I think is the word
I would have the ferrari, love that body style and the wonderfull noise
man who can jump start the earliest lmao. Maybe get some start lights or something
At least the Italians won at the second rolling race. Personally, I’d take the Ferrari, and it is the best looking car in my opinion.
The Porsche is a silent killer
Obviously SVJ
Porsche
There is no substitute... ;)
Ferrari sound was good
Porsche = super car killer
The lamborgini sounded the best and acording to me it is the best.
Hahaha i live in Italy ♥️
Porsche did its best♥️!!!
impossible porshche!
you guys should drive them using manual mode because the lamborghini is a monster and would destroy the ferrari and the porsche
Porsche- 1500 rpm soft limiter
I would have a SVJ63
Porsche technologie 💪🏻
Porsh king👍👏
11:05 I would be resubscibing just because of that "i'am puting my life at risque" lol sorry, already subscribed.
The Lamborghini
Ferrari is my favourite looking but the 992 is the prettiest Porsche since the 964. Id buy an Aston superlegera
PORSCHE ALL THE WAY !
ferrari and lambo bigmouth ahahaha porsche power
Now we need mclaren 765lt
Porsche proves size doesn't matter ...........
Porsche : "My day has come"
Das german ist sehr gut ja
Daaayyyymmmmn Porsche!!!!
Porsche is like a quite kid who grows up to become serial killer
Lamborghini
U
Ferrari 812
Always Camera man is at front to film it And that camera man use Porsche.
When Yianni says get through he says get "fru"
Super fast looks perfect
Reve in silence let your speed do the talk!!
German efficiency is excellence.
I would buy the Ferrari
If I had a choice, Porsche 911 Turbo S
For you, the day Porsche graced your race was the most important day of your life. But for me, it was Tuesday.
Porsche destroying them all
The Lambo looks better
In reality the quickest is the 812 Superfast. The SVJ & Turbo S naturally wins a drag race or the start because of the AWD system but in a rolling racing we all know what will happen. Funny thing too is that this is only an 812 If I can say "only" wait till the 812 hard core version comes out and then we see what's what against the SVJ as we all know the SVJ is the range topper from the Aventador line-up
Pls race the Porsche against the McLaren 765lt
Porsche is just phenomenal, Down on power and cylinders  And yet spanking supercars for fun...
disneyland
911 amazing "value" compared to the Italians
Ferrari!!!!!! love love love that car I would donate one of my balls for that car. and Get a Ferrari tattoo on your channel for that car!!
i would have the ferrari alllllll day over any car it is beautiful!!!!!!!!!
That German accent though🔥😂😅
1:06 his teeth look fake
The Porsche is: "talk softly and carry a big stick"!
F812 superfast
I so want that turbo s 😍😍
PORSCHE!!!
Lambo svj
Wtf, why was that Porsche revving so quiet lol
Porsche for me.....so much class.
Lambo
There are only about 4 seconds of these drag videos that I actually want to watch.
Gotta love german engineering, really want a Porsche once I've got a job, house, and I'm looking to retire. Who knows what theyll come up with by then
The Porsche. Great every day driver and the better car.
i want that superfast
Porsche
I would have Porche for sure!
I would take the Porsche all day long!
The Lambo and Ferrari are such a show off cars ... all that money, all that glamour, all that noise and then there is a simple silver turbo Porsche :D
Porsche
"We don't care about the Porsche"  That aged well....
Italian accent mat watson does not exist and cant hurt you
Porsche all day, every day
Porsche Is the loudest and Has de Best Sound 😂❤️
McLaren is the best
We want to see more Lamborghini drag races Matt ! ♥️
Porsche is incredible
Porsche
🏁 Porsche any day 🏁 💥
Porsche...There is no substitute
I want that Porsche now !! 🔥🔥
Ferrari
i love ferrari
Porsche
Ferrari fan all the way
bow down to the porsche...
Porsche sounds better, cause, I like it when its silent and deadly.
porsche by a mile over the other 2
812 superfast
Porsche all day every day 🔥
Porsche Turbo S all day every day.
The 911 Turbo S is an absolute monster, costs 100k/200k less and you can daily drive.
Turbo s ever
Yani is such a w_nker!
Ferrari 812 superfast its the best and my dream car
8:34 sounds like my PS4
I would have the 812 Superfast
The fact that I watched this 'freakinn awesome' video for free🔥🙏
All that aero on the SVJ is probably what killed it
Porsche wins again without a sweat. I remembered as a kid I loved the countach, the testarossa, the f40 but then a not so exotic yellow narrow body Porsche 911 they call the yellow bird took them all out on every category. After that I grew to love these 911s. They’re not as sexy as the exotics but they will run and beat the pants out of 98% of cars out there. The 911 is like fine wine where it ages well.
Video starts 5:20 😎
Aventador SVJ
new Porsche 🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙🐙
German 6 cylinders won in Italian 24 cylinders💪❤ (12 cylinders +12 cylinders = 24 cylinders😅)
Porsche is like a fart, silent but deadly 😂
Those accents in the beginning were cringe
Porsche sounded great
Porsche is the king!!
I would choose the Ferrari for looks but I would own a Porsche
Porsche 🔥
Porsche
Porsche: Hold my nuts, l can beat these two without them.
Porsche ❤️
Porsche always sounds the worse but always the fastest 😂
Ferrari everyday
Conclusion don't buy a Ferrari or Lamborghini buy Porsche
I would go for the Ferrari, no doubt about it!
Free revving your car's engine says a lot about you! It says, "I am a stupid wanker" to anyone within earshot. When you keep on doing it, you announce to the world, "I am a serially stupid wanker".
Porshe is the best
911
That Porsche is fucking heelll fast for a 6cyl stock factory
The intro 🤣🤣🤣
Porsche ,there is no substitute
the lambo as well as the audi looser the rolling starts by miles everytime
You did accents pretty good!
812 is so nice and beautiful
Porsche 100%
Yani cracks me up..
Yanny cracks me up 😂
Money no object? Porsche every day all day. Can drive daily, seats four, dusts just about every car out there.
I go with the ferrari 812. That v12 my gosh! Lambo single clutch gear box... Porsche insane but sounds meh. (The price is a lot cheaper than the others, thats a good point)
Porsche ✌️💪
911
I have watched first 15 seconds in this video more than 20 times 😂
Can you make a drag race with a Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat
The porche
812 all day long but in white
🇩🇪👊🏻
Of course the Lamborghini SVJ THE BEST
Porsche
They really don’t do roll races right. Every car needs to decide which gear is best to start in.
Demon racing the Porsche would be sick asf🥵
CS Panda sucks... 😂
Tidest  race between Yani and Matt 😂😂👏👌
Love the accents...😂😂😂😂👏👌
Great Welsh accent Matt 😂
Is nobody gonna mention that this drag race shot the video up to 2.8M views in just 1 short week? That’s pretty insane.
Yainnis reactions are 😂
812 Superfast
Its proven that CHEAP=BEST
Give me the 911 any day. So sick. All business. And the car to actually use and live with
Porche
Porsche
The Porsche looks like Miguel Oliveira...smooth, smart and winner!!!!
Ferrari la plus belle, Lamborghini la plus snob et la Porsche le guépard qui se cache 😜
Saw the thumbnail and already knew which car won.  There is no substitute.
Кто русский? Или хотябы знает этот язык
lamborghini very good
Porche its more up to me.
Tha Lambo probably spends every night at the retail park doing donuts for the 14-year olds. 911 Turbos sound terrible stock, but would easily be my choice over the other two - £5k on an exhaust and you are still £100/200k better off.
812 superfast ❤️😍😍😍
i will have 2 porches instead of ither ferrari or lambo
so nobody notice the Lambo started too quick ... ok then ...
Captions: ciao Bella it’s a mata Watson from adikiawa and they have to make these Porsche’s louder
I love that 911 😍
You're funny 😆😆😆
There si a video in this stereotypes
Everyone one - lamborghini avetador v Ferrari   Me - lamborghini avetador v Ferrari --- is there a new lambo model????
Ferrari
Lambo all day long ! Simply because its a much better looking car Full Stop 😉
that porsche is fast for a vaccum
Ferrari : Thor  Lambo: Hulk Porsche: iron man, the actual hero.
I would pick 1.ferrari,2.porsche,3.lambo sorry 😐.
lol hooligan LOl
It’s definitely Porsche she is cheaper and faster ♥️
The Porsche beating those cars is an insult as an italian. Porsche is my favorite car brand so I'm happy :)
I would choose the Porsche
Ferrari & 911 are perfect !!! Audi see you! Matt, thank you again)
Even before this video, Porsche! You guys didn't even use the best Porsche available 🤣😂
Ferrari 812 for me
The only reason why other cars keep up with the Aventador is because of its single-clutch transmission. As soon as Lamborghini gets a dual-clutch in their V12 car, it will drop everything else.
Porsche 911 turbo s 🔥🔥 Is cheapest one ☝️ and is the fastest one ❤️ I’m loving 🥰 it really
In central London nothing worse then big loud lambo that goes 15mph...Porsche is for the people that knows their value so they don’t need to show off:)
Gt2 Rs   Gt2 Rs   Gt2 Rs   Gt2 Rs
Make sure those tyres are worn!...out
Mat Watson has a great sense of humour. The way he impersonates the Italians accent.
Porsche 911 all dayy! but I'd feel so pretentious...
Porsche, it looks amazing.
Sure SVJ is the best car ever
Lambo for sure.
Buy the porshe if you want your passengers to die  Buy the Aventador if you want to break your passengers or anybody else’s ear drums  Buy the Ferrari if you just want a super car
An Audi Engineer once said a loud exhaust is wasted power or something like that.
Porsche 911 turbo is the best
04:21 Yanni's reaction to the Porsche's engine sound was priceless.
Porsche
So, to justify the 300,000 Ferrari, you have to be on an airfield, in 3rd and ready for any 992T that might be around?   Sorted, ill take one.
Porsche is an all-day car! My choice everytime
Wow that Porsche though half the price absolute rocket! If it sounded like the lambo it would be all-round the best car on the market
Nice accent
SVJ <3
Great accents kkkk
A base 911 in India costs a 160k pounds !!Thanks to our fucked up taxes .😭
The driver in lambo in 1st race done cheating, started little early.. Ferrari is best..
this man is driving the lambo like he stole it
this yane fella seems like a trust fund man-child
I am always supporting Lamborghini
Porsche definitely
CS Panda regretted lending his Ferrari 😂
Audi r8 vs Porsche 911  vs Amg gtr vs M8
Ferrari 812 Vs Mclaren 720s  It will be an impressive race
Mclaren
Lambo for sure
This new 911 turbo s is insane 😲 ... Honestly i didn't see this coming ...
yianne breaking the sound barrier with the lambo
812 superfast💥
812 ofc
FERRARI A 12
Would still have the Lambo all day
Porsche 👍💪😊
I will definitely take the SVJ without a question!  Then sell it and buy a Turbo S or a GT3/GT3RS and keep the rest of the money:)  Porsche is just perfect.
Amg gtr vs Lamborghini Aventador
I love porsche
Svj sounds ♥️♥️♥️
Ferrari: ahhhhhhhhhh    Lambo : ahhhhhhhhhh    Porsche fuiiiiiiiiiooooooo
Svj
Porsche be like: nothing comes close....
Porsche be loud tho
Porsche: We have alien staff  in our Laboratory
Off course the Porche Hate Italien cars And Italien Cars are over priced, plus you need two of each, so you can drive one while the other is in the shop. Porche always runs
I would have the Lambo to sell and get the porsche and some gas money
Ferrari is the Supercar 🏎
Amazing ... u r doing great 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Dislike due to accents
#PORSCHE
Imagine if the 812 has the novitec sound 💥 anyway it still faster than that svj 💪
https://youtu.be/O3OqGyqxIvI
Ferrari is the coolest car, and the Porsche had the best exhaust.
The Ferrari is KING, there is NOTHING like a Ferrari, I'd take it hand over fist over any of the other 2😍😍😍
Porsche..... Always
lambo sux
i like ferrari
Porsche  always
What ever are the results FERRARI ALWAYS 😁😁😁
that has got to be the ugliest colour spec for an aventador going
Porsche all day long
Porsche 👌👌
SVJ
Yianni uncle's white svj is my favourite...
Ferrari i would have for sure!
Porsche! After this, Porsche! Cheaper, and quicker!
Ferrari Sounds better for sure!
ferrari looks so much better then the lambo
Yannie always jump starts 🤣‼️‼️
The lambo and Ferrari are like the the loud  popular kids in school.
5:22
I'd take the Porsche
I'm a Porsche owner and love all 911's, but if this was price independent choice, I'd take the Ferrari for it's rareness, high value, different looks, and name - I don't care about the minimal differences between these cars in various performance tests - they are all the at the top.
Money no object - Lamborghini! Best looking car here!
911 turbo s
In Germany we dont say porchhh We say:porSCHe
That SVJ it's amazing.
i like ferrari and lambo but lambo has heavy cars but The only good car Lamborghini has made is the harucan performance
ferrariiiiiii
Porsche TOP
Porsche 🇩🇪🇩🇪💪
There is no question i would have the Porsche!!!!
Porsche!!
Yeah, a Turbo engine against Aspirated in drag races, totally fair. The first one is made for drag races like these, the other one (Aspirated) is made to do its best on track
I can't imagine what if porsche makes a v12 engine for a gt car ???
812 - Porsche is and looks common, Lamborghini is great to make a statement, Ferrari in this one has the best of both worlds.
I'm pretty sure that the Porsche has the best sound... Certainly has... With no doubt.
Ferrariiiiii
V12
i am from germany weissach. Porsche always have more horsepower than they write down on the Homepage. For example the last 911 Turbo from my dad has around 90hp more on the dyna
KEEP DOING THE ACCENTS!  LOVE IT!
Lambo
https://youtu.be/p9WaLAy3tXc
https://youtu.be/p9WaLAy3tXc
Porsche 100%
770 PS vs 800 PS vs 650 PS...  ...and the weakest wins 😃  In this performance class, it just makes the difference to be just a tenth of a second better or later on the accelerator ... none of the three cars take much, but the choice will always fall on the Porsche because the best overall package and more suitable for everyday use
812 vs SVJ vs 765LT
I would have the 911 turbo porshe
812 and a GT3 RS!   Perfect!
Even though the Porsche is the better car all around, if I could pick any I'd take the Ferrari.
PORSCHE TURBO S
812 superfast
To many ad's
Just 63
911
The super cars: we are a legends.  Porshe: you are dead, I am the killer of legends.😏😏😎😎😎🗡🗡💪.
Do a new drag race with a Mclaren 720 S
3.
Kill the Ferrari, F the Lambo, marry the Porsche
Ferrari Sounds the best
If money was no object, I would have all three cars.  - The Aventador SVJ would be for those dramatic, outrageous looks. - The 812 Superfast would be for revving that pyrotechnic V12 every morning (instead of having breakfast) and then leave it in the garage. - The 992 Turbo S would be for understated,  unassuming daily driving.  But if I'm only allowed one car out of the three, I'll have to take the SVJ. Even though it's the most uncomfortable and the most impractical, it will more than make up for such shortcomings by putting a permanent ear-to-ear grin on my face. That engine. That exhaust. Those looks. Oh yeah, and that sticker price.
Ferrari 812 superfast
Lambo!
porsche is the best.
I will take the Lambo, sell it, and buy 2 911turbo.
I’ll take the Porsche
Cars = porsche NBA = Kawhi Leonard
For me i'd have the Ferrari or the Porsche
I'd take the Porsche anytime.. what a beauty.
Lamborghini svj
Ferrari or Porche Lambo
The Porsche 911 Turbo S  is the ultimate super car. It is absolute top class in all disciplines. Porsche has managed to make the 992 even sharper and better than its predecessor. Incredibly impressive!
I love the ferrari
I'm taking SVJ all day! Porsche is a better daily driver tho!
Lol Porsche was quiet....it let it's speed so the talking.
Ferrari and Lamborghini Aventador svj
Can we plss have some time to epriciate on how good Mat Watson's accent were
Ferrari is te most beautiful car lambo is just crazy you must love it and the porche is good, fast but boring
I'd DEFINITELY rock that PORSCHE 911! Ugly my butt! It STOMPED the Lamborghini AND the Ferrari as well as it's the cheapest of the 3!
Svj vs 720s ?
Ferrari 812 v
Porche is like the Athletic kid who is good but not super popular with the cheerleaders but he goes home studies the strengths and weaknesses of his competitors and himself and works out a strategy to win regardless of their abilities... but still gets overlooked by the cheerleaders because they are superficial.
lambo is looking better, sounds better, almost as fast as the others so i can say its the best. but porsche is a fucking price/performance beast.
I would take the Ferrari 812 because it just looks sooo nice. However if i didnt have all the money in the world then porsche obviously.
Porsche 911 is the best and cheper car of ever
3:40 3:49 3:58 4:18
812 Superfast, any day, anywhere!
I would have the 𝙎𝙑𝙅
Id have the lambo all day all week
Love that german accent 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
911 all day long
Porsche sounds LEGAL, and it is the fastest!!! Nine eleven (the king)knows how to kick asses
Porsche killing them softly
992 Turbo S all day every day.
and even the porsche is the cheapst
HAIL THE 911!!👏
It’s insane how the Porsche 911 turbo, which has traditionally been considered an ‘attainable’ sports car, has quietly become a veritable supercar capable of slaying the ever-coveted Ferraris and Lamborghinis of the world with _substantially_ higher price tags. The 911 didn’t used to be even in the same conversation as offerings from the latter two. Crazy.
I would choose ferrari and Porsche any day
Lamborghini svj
Porsche it is
Loved that accents❤️
Porsche AllDay I’m sorry DLYDV
What is the all time fastest car you’ve driven?
Porshe
Of course the Porsche😂😂
It's funny how they love their brands. Seems like it's just the two of them racing... For 2nd place 😂😂😂  Porsche consider to be a default winner 😂😂
Porsche is best ALL DAY ANY DAY
Yanni sticking his head forward to go faster 😂😂😂😂😂
SVJ😻🤤
Ferrari..
Ain't that a shame..... Porsche got no attention but was the better car.
Porsche  nin yarıştan haberi varmı birader
911 TurboS is a beast.
ferrari always
Why don't you get that Lamborghini guy against Supra1000 or Acura NSX or Lexus LFA?
Ferrari please.... the lambo lacks class and just looks like something a teenage boy wants on his bedroom wall. The Porsche is awesome and a technical marvel, but very safe looking and quite staid inside. The Ferrari is the prettiest, the best sounding, the nicest on a long journey and is the best GT car here. No contest for me.
Porsche
Lamborghini aventador svj is cool
Lamborghini aventador svj
Can you Drive the lamborghini Oncee
I love the Ferrari 812 super fast and sounds loud
svj is brutal
I would have the lambo
I would probably have the Ferrari because 1 is can stand a chance against those two 2 it’s looks 🥵 amazing 3 that v12 is just so crisp
I'll always pick the Porsche over the other two
Lamboooooo
Porsche anyday it's almost like a sleeper no one expects it and BOOM
911
Please keep your Italian accent in future video, so funny
Porsche das auto
I like Porsche because it is a motivational car.  Even though it has less personality compared to other cars ,it has high performance
the lambo svj
488 pista vs svj please
👋🏽
I’d take the 812 Superfast
Yani and Matt should join Chris on Top Gear - that would be awesome (these three would make the show a success)
Would have the 812 superfast alll the wayyy
do a video on Mercedes Amg E63s sedan. 612hp, 0-60mph in 3.4s
Get a lambogine you will be faster
Hey can you do Lamborghini Aventador J vs Ferrari Laferrari vs McLaren P1?
Ferrari just to damn slick looking 🥴
Yup bro if u have a Bugatti it against so tha Porsche 911 best no one beat my fav. Car
Ferrari
Porsche turbo  isss the beeeesttt
812 superfast if i was on more of a budget the Porsche forsure🏎
The 911 is actually the best looking of the three!
I would like to take Ferrari because Ferrari is the fastest but the pickup is bad but the speed is only in Ferrari
The Porsche sounded the best.
Porsche.
812 super fast 4l
Lambo looks the most exotic, special and dramatic...it would be the one for me if i had the money.
I think the SVJ looks the best. But I think the super fast sounds the best
Porsche then Ferrari followed by the Lambo!!!!
Sound: SVJ FTW
I would go for lambo
911 turbo all day every day
Yianni always looks so angry😅
Porsche undoubtedly
I would go for the Ferrari just because of its design, not aggressive to the limit like the Lambo But I have to admit the Porsche is simply insane
Porsche VENCEU para variar!
911 Turbo s all day long
Loudest in the room is the weakest. Porche won with no warm up
Porsche
Lambo.. anytime.. everytime ! Matt!
Yall should've definitely ran the last roll race over because something happened with the Porsche.. it should've took that one too
I'll take the lambo thank u... But that Porsche is brutally fast!!
Porsche all the way.....
yanni always cheats on starts😂
Lamborghini could have possible won the drag race if it had a skilled driver having less weight and a early shifts    yanni really disgraces the Lamborghini  😭💔😭😥😥💔
you guys should do a lambo race: og aventador and og huracan
Ferrari
kids 156,000 £ is enough  .....
lambo
Porsche didnt had its sport exhaust on with the revving
I'll have the the Porsche. I love the engineering behind it!
Ferrari 812 in blue with yellow bits
Porsch + Software + Upgrade Turbos 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
I want to see these 3 vs a 720s!!!
Bro the lambo is hacking
Matt bring a Lamborghini sesto elemento
Hooligan🤣🤣
Seems to me, Lambo is build for viewing pleasure, not competition.
812 all day long
Piled on the timber.
When yianni said let's talk about the bull beating the horse 6:08 the porsche being like excuse me !!!!!
ferrari sounds best
The first enitial drag race lambo got a decent head start he went before she said go
Definitely the Porsche.
My mixer grinder sounds better than that porsche. But I find Yanni bit cheater
Ferrari look exciting, 911 beautiful coming from old times value, lambo mupet show. Certainly 911 for me, classy
Porsche its pretty impressive considering its about 100 00 DOLLARS LESS!
Porsche is the better car 😏
I think Ferrari is going to win
Porsche 😍
Lambo svj
911
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Lamborghini is the best car  And I like it
The Porsche in the normal race destroyed everyone x
Porsche turbo s
Best race I've ever seen online. Bravo Gianni...
Matt, as a professional linguistics expert  your accents are not bad in fact. But then again that's what I say when I think my brit accent is good.  Love the channel. Tell Yianni a OPA ... or call him a MALAKA. Hell love it. Live your channel to Vre Yiani ti kanis? Gia sou apo ameriki... 🇬🇷🇺🇸🇬🇧
Ma che cazzo sfutta chissu
Ferrari V12, lamborghini V12, Porsche Gt2 ou 918 ,mas mesmo assim o Turbo S deu trabalho!
I'd have the porsche and spent maybe 15k on a nice exhaust system
Damnit that Turbo S is sublime!!!!
Lambo
Turbo S over anything😍
The only way to defeat that Porsche is to race it against a Bugatti Chiron😂😂😎😎🔥
Aventador svj is far better looking stunning of all these 3 cars
Ferraris sound good but Lamborghini honestly has the best sound signature.
100% Ferrari is what I’d rather have of the 3.  But honestly the Porsche is a solid performer.
Oh Porsche my love♥️
Really a v6 beat up the v12’s how is that possible? Better engineering??
Dude driving the Porsche is special needs.
Imo the F12 Berlinetta > 812 Superfast
YouTube needs to regulate these ads
Porsche
Nothing beats Godzilla supercharged 1000 hp
Lambo looks the best
Porsche
Porsche is the best sport car ever!
Price and performance Porsche with an E on the end you Pratt😂😂😂😂
The Porsche with an E on the end sounds better than those spaghetti munchers
Lambo and ferrari: all hat and no cattle
I love how Yianni has, and continues to jump EVERY start in the history of @carwow drags, yet Mat never calls him out on it? Doesn't the gal doing the starts ever say anything?  He always jumps between the "1..." and the arm drop.  Video doesn't lie... go look at the last 3-5 of these drags.  She's GOTTA know that he does it every time. 🤬😤
And when the 918 porsche was there he kill this 2 italian cars
Porsche: "let success make the noise"
If money was not object it would have to be the Porsche 911 Turbo S it's just the more refined car
I would take the porsch for EVERYDAY and Ferrari for Meetings thanx
I`d like to own the turbo S...not that flashy, and it would make the best daily out of the 3 xD
Porsche take it all.The best sport car.
Yianni is the brit equivalent of Farghini
Ferrari
SVJ
Porsche👍
Why is he speaking like super Mario? 🤣🤣🤣
Just noticed that Ferrari’s oil temperature was just a mere 78 centigrades. That’s way too cold for thrashing it in this kind of tests...
Yen aku milih porsche lah, luwih murah meneh
Porsche. Everyday of the week. Never the Lambo :)
Dislike just of trying to talk like an italian even the italians dont talk so
I’d take the 911
Porsche 🤤😍
Ferrari is a better looking car
Yani jumped the start every time 😂
But lambo is an animal sounds like a lion
Ferrari
Lambo SVJ!!!!
Lambo
Kami suka Turbo :D
the ferrari
I haaaaate how they call the 911 „Pohhhrschhhh“ .  Porsche... Leute PORSCHE. Loud and hard „R“ and please do not miss the „e“! Dang!
Porsche is just incredible, but the looks are so bland compared to the Lamborghini and Ferrari. Me personally, I’d go for the SVJ no question. But kuddos to the Porsche!
This just shows us how fast the Porsche is really is that is mental.
I'm actually impressed with the Ferrari's time. 10.4 with RWD feels like a remarkable achievement to me; it's the same time recorded by the 720s, the Tesla model S and, in this race, by the SVJ. In fact, the only faster times I can remember on Carwow are this Porsche's ones and a 10.3 by the Taycan turbo S. Yes, very impressive and, actually, makes me wonder why Ferrari opted not to give the 812 AWD. Well, maybe they don't care about drag races, do they? 😊
Here in Perth Western Australia the aventador svj sells for 1.2 million dollars. Went looking at one few weeks ago
the porsche advantage is the world's fastest gearbox PDF
this faster gearbox makes the difference and so does the traction when starting lanch controle ( porshe )

i want the porsche that thing is fucking rapid
Yianni jumped the first start a bit
considering the amount of money I am paying, I would definitely go with the Porsche!
Porsche!
Lambo!!!!!
When you stub your toe in front of your crush. 11:24
[PORSCHE] long live the king.
that`s a cool intro
Did anyone notice mat making monkey noises after the race?
Porsche is the Best Looking & Performing &  & & & &.......
Killers usually silent.  Yobbos the loudest.
Turbo
I’d take all three cars
I won't fit the others. Definitely Porsche :)
Ferrari wins hands down on looks
Go to the USA and drive diesel drag trucks
Porsche!!!!!
gimme the ferrari
Porsche over anything.
Porsche, every day - except weekends. Then the Ferrari.
Love how they ignore the Porsche like it auto won
The 911 is the sleeper of supercars. Everyone wants the obnoxious supercars, while the 911 quietly drives around them.
PORSCHE - There Is No Substitute  ;)
SVJ
Two of the most annoying people Matt and Yan both with so much Verbal diarrhoea,want to see and hear cars not these two .
the lamborghini always comes out early
Lambo SVJ is the best in this group of cars. I would choose LAMBO.  Let's go Yanny
Can't wait for the 992 GT2 RS ...
What porche😂 only Lambo😍
Imagine if it was the gt2 porsche racing these two.
porsche... easy to drive, easy to park, easy to drag, easy on the price.... what else do you want
The Turbo S sounds definitely the best but it's so FRUSTRATING that it only takes such a little advance against the Italian trailers..
Yanni is always off the line before the gal even drops her hands, every single race. Cheat
Lambo!
can you stop all this beer-holding nonsense?
lamborghini made the best sound
German engineering > the rest
PORSCHE
Ferrai
Ferrari
Porsche walked those two easily light weight high horsepower
For the looks i would pick: 1st: Ferrari 2nd: Porsche 3rd: Lambo  For the car itself: 1st: Porsche 2nd: Ferrari 3rd: Lambo
Yianne is a bloody interesting guy, the 'chemistry' between him and Mat just makes these races worth a billion bucks👌✌️
Porche
Porsche is the best
I take the lambo all day...
You should use the same Ferrari 812 super fast and Lamborghini aventador svj but this time use the Porsche gt2 rs at least to make it fear.
Lambo is a head turner. Ferrari is a double take head turner Porche is [-_-]  personally, i like the Ferrari here, sleek and quiet design.
I think the 812 super fast sounded the best but im bias bc if I hit the lotto im getting that car.
The silver bullet!!!
Porsche : Be Quiet And Let Your Success Make The Noise .
the porsche just makes it cinematic for the other 2 cause it's just so far ahead
can't believe a 6flat engine crushed this 2 beast
Of i had money and because i am fun of Porsche iwant one😊
I would have ferrari 812
Can someone explain the science behind how the Porsche beats the higher spec Lambo/RaRi?
Porsche it’s the best
Porsche. Always. In any aspect.
5:20 of course the asbo in the Lambo jumps the start LMFAO
The most quiet, the cheapest but the fastest!!! Probably the best races in this channel.
Porch is the best looking
Ferrari please
Can someone explain to me how is that Porsche so fast in all aspects when it has only 650hp and it's not even the lightest car?
The svj
4:59 rev limiter i love you.
the only Good looking Lambo is the Urus
Lambo: ultimate Racecar Ferrari: ultimate gran tourer Porsche: ultimate all-rounder
Porsche... All day...
I was laughing all the way looking at Yani expression
Ferrari rolling race ✌
812 Superfast all the way
Egal was du machst die deutschen machens besser... whatever you do germans do it better

Best drag racing channel
Please make drag race of honda nsx and Porsche 911 turbo s and Lamborghini any one...
Ferrari all day everyday
Let's drag race the SVJ and the McLaren 720S
Lamborghini aventador is the fastest
i personally prefer the look of the 911 turbo, classic iconic without trying to be to load ''look at meee im a douche'' lol
Wtf !!   is that Porsche fitted with jet engine 🤣
Ciao bella was perfect I thought you are italian🍕🍝🍷😂😂😂 but I have a panda
I think lambo have jump start
Porsche “ really guys” Let me check on you.. Porsche “ Okay lemme tell you how this works”
Porsche, Porsche and Porsche that’s it. Not as expensive as a Lambo, but what a nasty and beautiful rocket🔥🔥🔥
"Silent is the gold".
I am very confused why the Ferrari and Lamborghini are happily competing for second place every single time.  This isn't even a competition.  In the car world right now it is Porsche... and then everything else.
Btw i got a tunned Porsche 911 turbo s if you want me to bring around some time for a race lol 2014
I have been waiting for this vedio for 1 year now
Porsche sound feel like rolls royce lol So quietly🤣
I don’t care what anyone says, something about that 812 superfast gets me smiling every time.
anime episode 1 english dubbed
I'd have the Porsche.  Simple.  It dosen't shout about itself, visually or by sound. You can drive that car on the race track and be amongst the very fast and you can drive it in a suit to a dinner party for Greenpeace. Its a car that can do a bit of everything. Its not a one night stand material, its wife material.  The Lambo is the one that gets all teh attention, but the novelty wears off quickly. All you're let with is a noisy car thats slower than a "boring" 911 Turbo. Defo one night stand material until the next Lambo comes out.  The Ferrari is a hard one. It dosen't look good, but it sounds decent. Dosen't shout about itself too much or too little. In company of the other two, it looses on all fronts.
Porsche
I'd get the Lambo and sell it for two Porsche's.
Makes you laugh you could get a 435d DIESEL stage 2 tune and keep up with these 100k+ cars.. 😂
Race between lambo and Ferrari.. the Porsche was just the judge of the race 😂😂
Drink 3 bottles of rose and watch this video 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Porsche 911 Turbo S FTW!
Ferrari or Porsche
Clearly the lambo sounds better
Porche shows doesn't show off💪
Porsche is GORGEOUS
Porsche in the front seat watching the big boys fight in the back lol
tyre pressure will increase as tyres heat up.
Porsche sounds like a vacuum cleaner
Lambo
Lamborghini UTERUS is the besstt
812 SF 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Definetly Porsche :)
LAMBOOOOOO
I’d take the Porsche! Never ever thought I’d say that but..... all things considered for a 6cylinder turbo.......
Porsche🤙🏻
I got great idea First Aventador vs SV vs SVJ
Love the intro !!
PORCHE-deadly as Ninja!
It would be cool if you also wrote speed at the finish
Race starts at 5:20
Wuld interesting with 720s
Adventador is totes better than 812 or 911
Superfast all day every day!!!
SVJ
Ferrari sounds the best tho
porsch 1000% its like an assassin
It's Porsche vs 1.6 times Porsche vs 2.3 times Porsche!!! Still...., Porsche won ❤️
Ferrari 812
I love the accent 😍

Ferrari and SUV
Porsche is Porsche amen.

I already knew that Porsche would win the race, so it was funny saying them making fun of the engine noise.
812 superfast
Lamborghini very awesome car
Porsche is the best car 😍
The Lamborghini was the best
Why would be want to end the beautiful sound of internal combustion for silent electric power
There`s cars in the world and PORSCHE!!!
Chiptune The Porsche
Lol they’re battling over who’s coming in second
hello everyone i cant believe this morning i got credited by a hacker i met online who i thought was a scammer cause it was too good to be true .....  i woke up to a mail on my phone notifying me that the sum of $15000 was paid into by blockchain account  and i got to pay bill with some of it .....contact anonymous on that site   https://www.anonymousjock.com/
Old Ferdinand smile
The svj
nobody said “porsche sounds better” 😂
As Jeremy Clarkson says: ""The Porsche is too booring" and i agree
The single clutch makes alot of difference,  guess the new Lamborghini flagship will be dual clutch xD
Yanni is an idiot.
Porsche... offensichtlich Ein Super Auto verkleidet als ein Sport Auto
The porsche is the quiet kid that keep up with the big big big boys
I enjoy seeing Yanni win against Matt because Matt's expression is always PRICELESS. And by the way, that's the good occasion to learn how British swear.
No comparison please.  Who will choose the Porsche? Germans....
That accent though...😂😂 Especially the German one...
Porsche
Porsche 911 turbo S
That German accent during the Porsche introduction got me. 🤣🤣. Nice one Mat
Ferrari 812 easy choice for me but if I could get any of these I would ! Lovely cars all of them
Lovely Jubbly, Porsche all the way, ageless.
Porsche is the best sports car for every day and in General💪👍
I would be so happy to see drag race between LaFerrari and this SVJ
He must be a good friend, Yanny, to let you in his VJ.    :-)
ferrari sound better
That Porsche man
Matt just has bad luck
Superfast

BEST. CAR WOW VDIEOE INTRO EVER SEEN
It's funny How Mat Mocked the Porsche End Ended up Losing
Ferrari
Ill Buy the Porsche
porsche all the way
Germans vs Italian
Yannie always jumping the starts
A wise man said once to me: If you want a car that gets lots of attention, buy a Lamborghini or a Ferrari. If you want a REALLY fast car, buy a PORSCHE.  Now I know what he meant
That lambo is not 3300 pounds 😂😂😂 it’s 3900  And the 812 is 3,593 lbs
Omg!!! Dat 911!!!!
Porsche 6 cylinders against 2-12 cylinder monsters and beating them smh. I need to own one of these.
Porsche for me....
These v12 sound are enough to make the porsche time useless.
THE 812 IS NOT A SUPERCAR IT IS A SUPER GT that's why it's so heavy.
Yannie’s game Face gets me every time
Porsche 911 Turbo S nothing even comes close 💜
Ferrari
Best looking is the 812 the svj has to much bodykit going on!! Imagine tuning that porshe!!!!!
Porsche gt2rs
Ferrari
I would choose the Ferrari forsure
👎for Porsche
The farrariy won I am not a Porsche or a Lamborghini fan
488 pista vs svj please
Ferrari 812 super fast for sure love that style and design of car. Would choose in a heartbeat over the rest
I laughed my ass off when Yianni nods his head afront just to make his car go faster by a few millimeter. I love it when he's in Carwow dragrace...lol
i would buy the ferrari 812 superfast as it  is a ferrari
Porsche👏🏼👏🏼
I'd take the 911, and drive it daily.   Best loser?  Ferrari.  That Lambo is so ugly and ancient.
Lamborghini and ferrari should study from Porsche even an half of cylinders are disappear then also he beat the powerful engine Porsche should remove the soft limiter
Putting a 63 sticker on that Lambo is kinda like putting an M badge on a Non M BMW
I think that the sound of Ferrari and Lamborghini isiquly good
Yianni jumps more than a kangaroo.
Porsche the fastest like all time 🙄
812 superfast😍
That intro tho XD
Ferrara
Yanni literally jumps/cheats on EVERYTHING smh
Porschhh!!!
Damn dat porsche was hot as heeeeellll
Porsche
Lambo

Again and again the only car worth its price is German.
Definitely Porsche!
5:20
Porsche/Audi/VW have the ultimate launch control system in the world
Omg love this rivalry 😂. Thank you guys for another great content. 👍
Bütün carwow un videolarını zevkle izliyorum ama bu esmer her seferinde GO yu duymadan başlıyor.

love that 6.5 svj. and did yianni gain some weight
Porsche Porsche Porsche✊✊✊
Porsche 911 turbo S ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Porsche 911 turbo s
SVJ FOREVAAAAAAAHHHHH
100% porsche turbo S
RS4 B8 VS S3 8V
I mean who cares about the prosche.It doesn't have a Sound and the looks next to the the other cars are just bad.But if we only tale the performance than ok..
The Ferrari is just gorgeous! I do also like it with that black colour. But obviously the Porsche is the better car, even with the 150hp less
Ofcourse I would own a LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR SVJ 🖤
Love the Bromance of Matt and Yiani❤️❤️❤️❤️
the porsch
More plugs than Victoria plum.
Lambo good sound
The Porsche is a complete Animal!
Lamborghini sounds great
A que altitud hacen estas pruebas?????
Svj
The different accents done at the beginning ware very funny.  Please do it more often. It made me laugh.
I will go for lambo with the speed of the porsche
Porsche 👌🏼
Porsche is the best powerful car but the Lamborghini is the most ostentatious (and expensive) Ferrari is...... badly 😂
Porsche 911 Turbo S is just a beauty🔥
Even though the porche is fastest in drag, in all other factors the italians are better
Best driver's car... Porsche👑
In one of the Carwow Drag Races, BMW M8 Competition Vs Nissan GTR(tuned to 650HP) Vs Ferrari GTC 4 Lusso The M8 beat 'em all..with the Ferrari doing Standing quarter mile at 11.4 seconds and here we have it in 10.4 seconds.  Well..what can you say about the creditability of performance of such cars with Mat Watson. 🤐
If I had to spend that much on a supercar why the FFFF doesn’t the Porsche have exhaust bypass valves after the cats so it’s still legal and drivers can enjoy some noise??? Noise is a huge part of a cars character I just don’t see why Porsche don’t ad a valve it’s not new tech geez
Both italia
I was surprised that the Turbo S w 150 less hp then the 812, and 180 less then the SVJ kept up w both of them in that first race🤔
The Lamborghini because lambo for everyday
Jump start by the lambo
Aventador svj
ok
First time seeing the flag girl that close
Porsche
I definitely would by Porsche :)
I think the lambo won that
“But we will crush them”
First race the guy in the Lambourghini cheated. He jumped the gun.
Please re view ferari
Yanny and matt are a vibe
No one else notice how happy yanny is lol idk if it’s the svj or idk
Porsche !! Comme d habitude !! La meilleure en depard arrêté !!
Ferrari is the best❤️❤️🔥🔥 it sounds so good and smooth (greatest of all time )
Can I use this video
Half the cylinders ...... the perks of tuŕrrrrrbo people .....
Porsche !!!!!!!!!forever!!!!!!!
Caramba a porsche destruiu os italianos 😂😂
I’d rather have the Porsche n give my dad the Ferrari...  But in the end its every kid’s dream to have a Ferrari one day...  So Ferrari, although it would get me killed in case of an emergency stop
Porsche !!!
Matt ill take the Porsche anytime ;-)
Lambo jumped the start like crazy.
Best sounding was Ferrari for me
I’m sorry but I’m taking the Porsche any day
In terms of depreciation, the benefit you get as an owner and overall rarity I'd take the Ferrari. They depreciate slower than the Porsche cause they are fully hand built and rare. Plus you get that amazing warranty from Ferrari, and the benefits as an owner are amazing, trust me I know a Ferrari owner personally. That Lambo did sound good and that Porsche is amazing, but Ferrari all the way for me.
A Volkswagon beat a Lambo and a Ferrari.
Dreams bro...dreams
Lambo
Porsche is just the best , German quality and engineering 🤩
K
Porsche’s are just fucking insane
Mate go to @5:23 lol what is that for a reaction lol these ain't even close to be similar cars lol RWD then 2 AWD lol put it up against something else which is RWD...
Everybody: The perfect car doesn't exist  Porsche 911 TS: Hold my gas...
World class is Porsche?
Definitely Porsche 🥰
911 all the way
SVJ hands down.
Porsche vs 720S
Porsche
I must admit when Yianni first guested on Carwow, it was quite entertaining. Nowadays he’s just a loud sore looser.
Porsche is fast AF the lambo sounds the best. Ferrari maybe... idk
Money no object? Customize a Porsche. Hands (and pedals) down.
Ferrari hands down perfectly specked too black with yellow just needs some exhaust work!! Lol the Porsche looks don't do it for me and the Lamborghini is too uncomfortable
992 turbo est vraiment incroyable !!! 😍🤙
Porsche the boss 😉🖕
Lambo all the way
Guys, if the 992 turbo S is as freaking fast as this, imagine the next 992 GT2 RS...
Let’s be honest the fastest car the Porsche 🏎💨
Lambo: I'm the loudest Ferrari: I'm the fastest Porsche: Kidz, should ve start za race? Ok, hold mein beer....
ferrari sounds best and i’d have the ferrari
the Porsche looks so short & cute with its huge wheels but eats both of them alive cruising in the background lol
can you make a video of the 911 turbos s vs all of the tesla models? 😃
Tutti concentrati sulla Ferrari e la Lambo ...però vince sempre la Porsche🤔🤔🤔
Porsche absolutely!
them accents are on point!  more please
"There is no substitute..."
ciao bello come stai tutto bene? @carwow
The really ironic part about the Porsche crushing these two super cars in a drag race...is that Porsches are not DESIGNED to be fast, straight line cars, they are meant to rip around twisties with serious finesse, speed and sick grip.  Incredible!
If I could only have 1, I would get the 911 Turbo S. It seems more daily driveable than most other supercars and it will get less attention from other drivers and police (plus it's one of the better performing supercars, as is made clear by this test). I actually really love the look of the standard Aventador. The SVJ is cool, but the changes to the appearance and the wing are a bit odd. If I could have several supercars I would love to have the 812 Superfast in my garage. It's a very very good looking car. Seems nice for cruises along PCH.
Ferrari's my choice
The Porsche is so poor...
Dont forget that Aventador is in the end of its life and 812 almost as well. Porsche just came out of the plant.  In addition, the gearbox of aventador was not designed for the fastest gear change as Ferrari for examples which looses time because it is RDW.
OMG i love you matt !!!!
F12 is still my favourite tho
I'd definitely own the Porsche out of the 3. It has the lowest douchebag factor, is the cheapest, performs the best, and is quiet class.
Porsche sounds the best ofc
Exactly that type of Porsche is my Dream car so i wood pick the Porsche
Yanni looks like a pickpocket
Results are unsurprising. Porsche launches the hardest, lambo did well considering its weight, ferrari last duh
Tesla Roadster would like to have a word...
The GTC looks way beautiful
Lambergini
Porsche💪
tylko porsche
Actually you really good in the accent
Lambo svj
The Germans must be doing something right! That Porsche rocks! Lambo looks best imho!
Next time use the porsche gt3
I would have the Porsche, a Cayenne Turbo, a trailer, a Ducati V4 R and a vintage Formula Atlantic car with change in my pocket
I would take a Porsche any day!
Adakah orang indonesia yang nonton di sini?
I love Porsches (dream car) plus the only car manufacture that can sweat Porsches is the Maclauren, period!!
Matt always beat yanni 🤣🤣🤣
These super car brand are irrelevant it’s Between Mclaren & Porsche
Next drag race: porsche 911 turbo s vs Ferrari F8 Tributo
Is it that a Panda??
I would rather have a Lambroghini Adventador SVJ than a Ferrari
Porsche for value for money
Lambroghini sounded the best
I’d rather have the frarri
Daddy porche 🚀
Lol porsche as usual quietly smashes the noisy junk cars. Be a good idea to check the undersides of the lambo and ferrari after this drag race. There will be bodywork worm away.
I think. Ferrari is the best
812 Superfast sounds the best
Looks and sound: ferrari Reliability : lambo I don't even want to say it (best car unfortunately) : porsche
i'd like the ferrari
Did your brain fluently changed 911 color from silver to red as it was expecting silver? at 2:34 ?
Nobody:  Yanny: CMON, CMON😂
porsche  is bug
l'italiano si è suicidato
SVJ
How about drag racing some plug-in hybrids /PHEVs against each other and in comparison to their petrol/diesel only models/ counterparts.....  There's plenty of comparison possibilities and i think it would be really interesting to see what hybrids are capable of doing .....because most of them are pretty much neat at their amount of HP !  with PHEVs in a race you could do drag modes like  1) full boost (petrol+e-mode / full systempower) 2) battery only/ e-mode only  3) petrol only  Audi has nice TFSI e - Models, BMW, Bentley, Mercedes, Porsche, Range Rover, etc  for example do this:  Big Limos:  Audi A8 60 TFSIe (449HP)    Vs    BMW 745e xDrive (394HP)    Vs    Mercedes S560 e (476HP)    Vs  Porsche Panamera 4 E-Hybrid (462HP)  or SUVs:  Audi Q7 60 TFSIe (456HP)    Vs      Bentley Bentayga Hybrid  (449HP)    Vs    BMW X5 xDrive45e (394HP)    Vs    Range Rover Sport P400e (404HP)   Vs Porsche Cayenne E-Hybrid (462HP)    Vs Volvo XC90 (390PS)      Vs    VW Touareg R (462HP)  or Hot Hatches:  Audi A3 40 etron (204HP)      Vs     Mercedes A250e (218HP)     Vs     Seat Leon eHybrid (204HP)    Vs    VW Golf 8 GTE (245HP)   The choice is yours, Matthew  :-D
Anyone here that says they wouldn't realistically have the Ferrari is not being a realist.
The lambo and Porsche are both the top of the range models. When are Ferrari coming out with the track focused 812
Voices were the best 😂💕
Porsche 911 Carrera turbo s all day long is my favorite  car !!!
911 Turbo S everyday all the way all around the best, Lambo number one for looks, Ferrari WHO?
Definitely Porsche
lambo: oh porsche! lambo: killed the ferrari tho
I need an SVJ one day so I can do donuts
that Porsche is pretty impressive
1st drag The Lambo stole the start, big lag on the Ferrari... 2nd drag they all started at the same time...the Porsche all the way
Il piu rumoroso della stanza e anche il piu debole!!porsche lol
I'd take the lambo, it looks cooler in my opinion and Idc if it's not that fast
I'd have 911 Turbo S :D
pov you underestimated the porsche
Yanni and Mat are so competitive in the second race that the 911 is forgotten XD
I would have Lamborghini and Porsche got smoked in the roll lmao
PORSCHE ALL THE WAY
SVJ sounded the best since the 911 won't rev :(
The porsche is awesome
Lamborghini best car for me. The second drag race is the best drag race ever on this channel! It was so so close!!!
Porsche all day!
For me? Ferrari 812 Superfast by Novitec (epic exhaust)
CONCLUSION: YOU BUY THE PORSCHE
That guy Yanni needs to get out more .....
Porsche with aftermarket exhaust system ..If same price though I'd take Lambo
A McLaren would destroy them all
I'd have the Porsche
lambo lambo lambo lambo lambo lambo
downvote this comment if you hate the lambos gearbox :P
Always fun when Matt's in a race with Yanny! Do more of these! That Porsche, though!
Now waiting desesperately 992 GT2RS 💥🧨🍾
Porsche 911 Turbo S any day
porshce has v6 3.8l engine but how can it beat v12 6l engine cars? can somebody explain
Ofc I would pick the SVJ
Money no object. Still Porsche. Obvious choice. Maybe too obvious🤔
Don't use stort mod in lambo
porsche👑
Porsche 🤗💖
Ferrari still look best
Lambo rhe best in the world
Next 911 turbo s vs tesla model s p
Lambo SVJ
im so used the 911 turbo just battering every supercar in these videos so this was expected lol
Porsche Porsche
Ferrari looks the best and Porsche has the best performance but the lambos sound is class
Lambo. Sell it. Buy 2 porsche's
The Porsche! It cost half the Lambo! OMG  How come the Porsche is so freaking good in all areas. Take it to the track and it might humiliate the Ferrari and Lambo even more!  Try a chip tuned Turbo S one day and you will set back all the Tesla fanboys as well 😀😀😀
rev limiter removal in the Porsche then i have that
That flames on the Lambo😍🔥
After mocking at porsche's exhaust sound...their makers be like: work in silence let your success make the noise🤩😋😉
Porsche all the way.
Loved the faux accents at the beginning of the video 😄
Definitely 812 superfast
Porsche
No brainer, I love the front views of both the Lamborghini and Ferrari, so I would have to go with the Porsche.
i love superfast but porsche is realy good car
Porsche
Porsche every day.  Fortunate to drive a 991.1 turbo very recently as part of an experience event.   Yes the lamborghini is more flash but completely impractical and no fun down anything like a b road in the UK, plus not exactly at home on a track.  The ferrari could be interesting though but still not sure it wouldn't be too big.
best .. porsche  ..  best looking .. porsche
ferrari 812
Can’t imagine what will this gen GT Rs’s will do! That last gen one already was a bullet!
Something is wrong with your marketing when you call your car Superfast
I'm starting to think that Yannis is loosing the races due to his kilos, rather to the cars' weight
Ferrari 812
The Lamborghini with Porsche Gear box= winner
i think the ferrari and the lamborghini is the best but most powerful mat ferrari
All three
Get some proper drivers and the lambo ends 1st, the Ferrari 2nd and the Porsche 3rd. Just look how the Ferrari messed up the start .....
Ferrari sound good
Ferrari!!!!!
The Porsche, it's a magic machine  👍💪🤩
Lambo
Can you do Huracán Evo vs. Huracán Performante?
Now i know why yanni was ignoring the Porsche cuz Porsche was very quiet and fast so he couldn't hear or see it  in the race
Porsche ❤️
Superfast is the best looking, porsche and svj. Too many angles on the lambo for me, the curves is where its at.
How about a Hypercar drag race
First choice will always be the Porsche . . .
Porsche is value for money
Let’s talk about the bull beating the horse
Mat put this 911 turbo S  against a McLaren 765LT
“I hate losing”
what an intro woww
Italian cars just looks and sound and expensive, but when it comes to the real deal ,leave it to the germans👏🏻
Lambo jump the start.. hooligan
My favorite drag race ever❤️❤️❤️❤️
Genuinely enjoy the content :)
Wow the cheapest car smash them
I cant wait for the GT3 RS
People used to say ohhh Porsche is only quick on the Nürburgring but is it only the case now?
Even the Porsche was slower I would still pick it any day, but I still love the Ferrari. Lambo is way over the top and would attract ridiculous amounts of attention wanted and unwanted. Pretty impractical for the real world IMO.
Yiani so funny
Ferrari
Also what it wasn’t said in the text of these super cars is that the Porsche delivers better MPG. Making it cheaper in price as well as driving it. V6 vs V12. What a shame!
Lamborghini svj 😆
Porsche all the way, far more comfortable seats, fast enough to take on the Lamborghini and the Ferrari, looks great and classy plus it cost lot less money... Mic Drop!
Superfast for sure
I’d take the Porsche 911 Turbo S for which there is no substitute.
Too many ads and plugs.
That Ferrari is lit
this the best car channel
Porsche all day every day!!
I really want the Lamborghini Aventador, that thing looks insane
Who is going to take their $250,000 - $350,000 car and abuse their drivetrain doing quarter mile runs?   Rolling race all the way and Ferrari ftw.  Porsche will always have the edge in the 1/4 mile due to its awd drivetrain.
There is no substitute.
I would take the porsche everyday of the week. But the Ferrari is the sexiest by far.
After instant replay early  jump on Matt/ferrari on second attempt! Penalty- Yanni wins this one again hahaha
Yannie:cant hear it Mat:cant hear it to When porsche win. Yannie:wow porsche! Mat:i think the porshe won. Thats call karma.😂
Porsche is quiet but dangerous 😂
Even before you asked I already knew I'd choose a Porsche
We could go without the Turbo S. It's fast but who cares. The SVJ vs the 812 SF is were it's at. Love the V12s singing. What was the SVJ time from the first drag race? I'd go SVJ for Yianni but 812SF for It's rwd ness
6 win 12
Porsche all day all night.
The Lamborghini looks the best
i would want the low pro looking grey car in the back over the rest and is still the fastest
Lamborghini aventador svj 😍
A Geico ad came on in the middle of this and the gecko has the same voice as the car wow guy
Porsche all the way
I like the look of the SVJ the best but the Porche is a driver's car so that's my choice if I had the $.
Corran en koenigsegg
Yianni... the king of jumping the line. smh.
What could Porsche do with another $100000?  Would it be a fair comparison?
There is no substitute.
Ferrari
I like the way Matt Watson started off the vedio with an Italian accent 😂😂😂
If anything just sell those two cars for the porsche is fast
if lamborghini chucked a double clutch in   the svj it would be a beast
even though it’s a porsche it’s a sleeper
911 TTS vs the Lambo evo would be great.  I am thinking the 911 would win.
The Porsche 911 Turbo S everyday😎
That Porsche 911 Turbo S is a very quick car to win the race. I like the sound of the Lambo the best.
Unpopular opinion: this is the Best Racing video from Carwow
He jumped the first race, as per usual!
Italians do it better? Not this time for sure!!
PCCB's!!
#lambo is best looking
THE REPLACEMENT FOR DISPLACEMENT
Only place Porsche is behind was rolling race manually shifts . .
The 911 IS the best for the Price first and for ALL at 2nd Quick beautiful tech.,....all its the best option for supercar at this moment.they limited édition gone take value
Porsche turbo understated and rapid
P
"let's talk about the bull beating the horse"    funny how porsche also has a horse in it's logo isn't it ?
The Porsche is a perfect machine 😧
Lamborghini aventador svj
"It'll go viral if I die!" - best way to live!
For performance. Porsche. They're just killing all the bulls and horse's. For looks? In Black the Ferrari is just Darth Vader bruh! Got the music and everything. But in any other color I'm taking the Lamborghini. Sounds absolutely delightful (sic) and got the looks to boot! But for everyday driving and a can of whoopass? I'm taking the Porsche again. Because you know... Z Germans just know what they're doing bruh!
V12 cars just sound so shite...V8‘s sound the best by far
Only Porsche can make a 650hp car  compete and beat 700-800hp cars.  Truly amazing. To be more fair they should have used a gt2rs.  That would eat both those cars alive.
Ferrari 812 Superfast
The Ferrari sounds far superior to any and all. I have heard all three in person, nothing sounds like a 812/La Ferrari. The Porsche actually sounds pre darn good when your driving it, not sure if it’s fake or not though.
911 for me Matt :-) sorry Yanni.
The Aventador will always be the best sounding car ever.
Porsche by far
Porsche, hands down. The Lamborghini only says one thing about you 😜
Ferrari!!! For life!
Biggest gamble on this page; scroll to comments to find the time stamp for the start of the drag race but risk seeing all the result before hand.
Lambo is my favorite
Race starts at 7:03
This Ferrari ist so ugly...  Porsche👍🏻
For me the 812 sounds better than the Aventador
https://youtu.be/e7SooO03bJ8
https://youtu.be/e7SooO03bJ8
Porsche clearly wins sound test 🤣🤣🤣
The Porsche.
Porsche 911 Turbo S gonna beat em all
Porsche got dropped in the last rolling race couldn't live with the big boys
Porsche is best lookin and best in package
LAMBO
Single clutch holding the svj back?
Introduction - Mat doing silly voices. Cut to Lamborghini and there's Yianni high on blue M&M's and Haribo doing a silly voice! Who, apparently is "ripping the brand" ????????? And he always cheats at the getaway,
That porshe is a beauty
Porsche is fast
Nailed the accent
Porsche for me all day every day--dream lol
When yani races you can literally see his heart
Almost 190 mph in the rolling race!!!
Best carwow intro ever
Best carwow intro ever
Best carwow intro ever
You Need the UGLY SISTER ON HERE
Comon the porsche wasnt even trying in the soundtest😂
Porsche everyday
Ferrari
We don't like to talk about our performance but we will crush them
Now imagine the Porsche tuned to 800hp and still being tons cheaper...☺
รัก Porsche
Yianni doesn't even care about the Porsche he just wants to beat matt 😂😂😂
Porsche is witchcraft
Yanni is always SO HAPPY and FUNNY!
I mean... come on...! It's the Porsche - all day long...! It's absolutely the only one you could live with day-in, day-out, yet still thrash pretty well every other car on the planet at the weekend... :-)
The 911 lost the rolling race lol
Svj
Porsche
Soooo no one’s gonna point out that the Svj and 812 were as fast as the 720s on the 1/4 mile?
Porshe
Incredible how the porsche still won, without warming up its tires. Also, if you watch closely in the start of the first race, you notice the lambo started earlier
This cars power doesn’t belong to this race because it’s just belong the quality of driving
Did they put rocket fuel in that porsche ?
What the hell do they feed the Porsche in Germany? is incredible how it destroys the competition
The quietest makes the glory lol
I'd take the ferrari
Porsche did a great job again...awesome! Smaller engine, less power but more torque, higher weight than the Lambo and still the king. By the way, Lambo starts early.
Ferrari anyday everyday ,like if u are a ferrari fan
PORSCHE
That's the problem when you have a Porsche. You had better buy it for your own enjoyment because people with other exotic cars will just ignore you🤣
Porsche all the way!!! It’s the best all around super car
Porsche for the winner
Honestly am I the only person kinda disappointed in the new turbo s? It doesn’t look good and with all that extra power I expected it to run easy 9 s but it’s barely faster than the previous turbo s. Still it’s amazingly fast but just expected it to be in the 9 s
Porsche, all day. Not in silver though. It's the most cost effective by far, yet still the quickest, and also the best all around car.
Wow what an engine porsche
Ferrari, maybe Porsche ... definitely not the Lambo, those colours are horrific :D
And in the end wins the Germans.....
brilliant accents :)
PORSCHE👌💣
I wanna SVJ because i sell it and i buy 2 Porsche.
I would go for the Porsche
porsche
The 911 will keep on going long after the Lambo catches fire and the Ferrari breaks down. Kind of makes you wonder what you're getting for your extra £150K in the case of the Lambo and £75K in the Ferrari. Six opposing cylinders will never sound as good as a V12 but that 911 didn't appear to have the factory sports exhaust.
OMG that 911!! incredible what it can do with that powertrain :o
Lambo
Ferrari but in Yellow! 💛😍
Lambo songs better
The 911 turb is a middle finger on wheels
WOW!!!!! Mat That was good with the accents. Hilarious   LOL
best sound: ferrari Best looking: porsche money no object and i had to buy one of these three i would buy the ferrari, it just sounds so good
Ferarri looks the best to me but of course id have Porsche. Performance > Looks
The best looking car is Ferrari of course
都挺好，努力去买一台，大家可以给我订阅吗
SVJ : Track 812 : Rolling 911 : Drag
Well done Ferrari... A v12 n/a luxury car destroyed a turbo GT car with 100 nm torque more !
Porsche! 👏👌💪
that Porsche is kind of a quiet guy who doesnt show off his presence but when hes mad, he shows his athletic prowess against wannabe alpha loudmouth lambo and ferrari to beat them up ^^
I'm not a Ferrari fan boy, and I hate you, so?
Italian for show, German for go.
Yanni sits that far forward he doesn’t really need a backrest on his seat..
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Imagine letting Ali G drive your SVJ.
The Lambo has as much class as it's driver. That is to say, not much.
ferrari sound like a mosquito 🦟
812
I think the 911 looks the best, and it is the best, and it’s way less money and probably way more reliable and has back seats!
RSQ8 vs X6M drag race please.......
Why didn’t you do a spanish accent....?
Porsche
Ferrari
I don't remember an episode with Yianni without a jump start 😂😂😂😂
I'd just get a Porsche turbo (non s), I bet you that would still beat the Ferrari and lambo. Looking forward to the review!
Which car u want?   I want them all!  Brian O’Conner aka Paul Walker FnF 4
Turbo S all day, everyday. Dream car that I'm working towards
Porche
The one and only Porsche
Ferrari 812
lambo sounded better
Cool, But you need to test them on a twisty track, that's why Nurburgring times are important... Lambo should have a bit of an advantage being mid engined I guess....
This yiannimise guy is such a sore bitter loser lmao
ferrari 812 sound is better
Ferrari 812 would be the car that I choose, all day long.
Ayo,Mat your Italian & German accent was on point.
Porsche are performing magic. How can Ferrari and Lambo make cars that cost over £100k more but not be as fast? I don't if that makes Porsche genius or Ferrari and Lambo complacent?
Yanni is a very like-able chap
Zwei alte (aber liebenswerte) zu groß geraten Kinder in italienischen Spielzeugen, wobei der Bulle unter Federführung von Audi gebaut wird, werden vom unscheinbaren Zuffenhauserner mit einem Niemand als Fahrer - wie oft wars ? - viermal gebügelt. Was soll uns das wohl sagen? ;-) Two old (but lovable) too big children in Italian toys, the bull being built under the auspices of Audi, are taken by the inconspicuous Zuffenhausen resident with a nobody as a driver - how often was it? - ironed four times. What is that supposed to tell us? ;-)
haha I like when nobody cares that this ugly 911 was the quickest.
German elements
Porscheeeeeeeee turbooooóooo sssssssssssss há há há!
Only Porsche, tesla  and Mercedes  knows how to do fast and affordable cars...
Que dirá ferrari de porsche Jajajajajaja 😩 La mitad de motor La mitad de precio
Come on that Porsche is quick and that Lambo looks and sounds great but fuck that if you’re thinking I’m picking those cars over the Ferrari!
İmagine: if the porsche had 100 more hp  🚀🚀🚀🚀😁😁😁
yuanni from yuannimize i like the nigga and matt cool car chemistry
7:34 did yanni put his head forward like a sprinter? 😂😂
Thanks for the video. But I think you didn’t give the 812 justice. I believe it did an outstanding achievement by finishing 10.4 the quarter mile. I’ve never seen it that fast before.
porsche every time - the others will break down all the time.
Lambo
I'd take the Lambo, sell it and buy two Porsche 911 Turbo S
The 812 because I can put a enlargo kit on it
Btw why don't you try to get a dodge demon to drag race with the Porsche?
3.8 Turbo vs 6.5 NA, that's it...
Turbo S  EVERYTIME!!! Friggin insane!🔥💀
7:05 love his expression 🤣
Why are you still lining cars up against the new Turbo S? I’ve not watched the video yet but I know which way it’s going...
porche turbo 2
YES THE PORSCHE DOESN'T MAKE SOUND BUT IT CAN BREAK THOSE SOUNDS
Lightest, fastest and most comfortable dream fucking car
Came here to watch two Volkswagens smash a Ferrari
Lambo svj
This is the noisiest drag race ever
Porsche is the best of all time
Lambo, for looks.
Fan of mat so should buy 812 superfast
812 superfast
Porsche 911 ❤️
The Ferrari is beautiful followed by the Porsche and last the Lambo.
Porche 100%
If money were no object, I bought like to have a Ferrari. I’ve always been a fan of the 488 coupe and 458 Italia
Even though a GT2 RS is a rwd car, I am sure it's much faster than a 911 Turbo S. So if you are comparing top of the line Superfast and SVJ, you should try to put them VS a Gt2 RS(I assume it is not easy to find one). Great videos as always!
Lamborghini everyday, I own the SV-J’20 @jakebrenkolva on IG.
Turbo s
yannie guy is insufferable
911...wow
What is that intro? 🥴😂🤣🤣
I'll have a Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, then sell it and get 2 Porsche and some spare cash😎
Hates on Porsche my favorite car btw and loses to it
Top of the class, Porsche Turbo S, fast, quiet, deadly.  My C4S may not be as fast, but it sounds better, gotta take what you can.
Imagine if the lambo didn't jump...
Ima say porche bc im clearly... cough cough... mat       get it? mat sounds like mad... nevermind I'm horrible
Hands down the Porsche is the best all rounder car and looks. 😁
You put the mclaren 720s and will smoke the porche try to put a na car from porche to see if they will do something
Lambo all day 🔥
Hey... It's Posh-a 🙄
Best value for money is : Porsche  Best sound design : lambo  Over all : Ferrari
Ferrari is best one
Looks take the Ferrari all around value and performance Porsche hands down mate
The look on Yianni face when losing to Matt is priceless 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. Much love Yianni🙏
What car looks better ? Frankly... Ferrari’s are gorgeous to me, but cannot deny the performance from the Porsche. Not to take away anything from Lamborghini. All are amazing and fine piece or art and performance
Zi Germans once again have shown what humility can do, lol. Funny that during the first run, The lambo definitely took off before the go but Porsche still smoked it. Second one that it was better start.. no chance.
812
Someone explain why that Porsche so fast but on stats it’s lacking   It looks the best btw.
Lamborghini sounds 👌
Lambo sucks. Ha Ha.
I’d get the Lambo, sell it and get a Turbo S and a Turbo S convertible.. 😅
I’ll take the Lamborghini, but boy does Porsche make a great cat!!!!
"No lets talk about the bull beating the horse" ... the Porsche is a horse mate.
Porsche 911 😍
SVJ all the way
I’m disappointed in the 812 “superfast”
Turbo S every time over the plastic gang bang
I would get Porsche 100%    cheaper/ MUCH more reliable /fast Af
I want the Ferrari!!! But I love the 911
ferrari
Hay algo que ese porsche no haga bien?
812
Omg here comes the AD 4,3,2,1
Porsche
i have seen that lambo in cardiff. literally looks like a plane. seriously huge and beatiful
https://youtu.be/BYmQWETbfLk
Definitely the Porsche
Lamborghini obviously 🙄
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
812 superfast vs huracan performante in rolling race
Ferrari still my pick
I'd have that Porsche for pure speed
Porsche is EATING THEIR LUNCH!
I would take the Porsche
I'll take the Porsche all day EVERYDAY.
Yani jumped and still lost to the TURBO S😁😁💪🏾
TESLA ROADSTER :)
Turbo S all day!
The Lamborghini reminds me of a 911 RSR
Svj
ЕГАТИ нещастници те. ТОЛКО преднамерено тест. Уникална тъпотия. На ФЕРАРИТО му занесе те чаша вода и се скрийте НЯКАДЕ.
That Porsche is from a different planet 🤯
812 super fast look the best
Yiannie should go to be an actor, not behind the wheels.
I’d have the 812
One of the best racing.
Roadman yanny
Porsche, every day.
I would have chosen the Porsche
Porsche
Heaven is eleven
The SVJ looks like an 11 year old drew a door wedge.
Yanni *ALWAYS* jumps the starts, ALWAYS! Why doesn't anyone call him out on it?
I've said this before, will say it again:  Nobody: The perfect car doesn't exist. 2021 Porsche 911 Turbo S: Hold my beer
Lambo. Easily. Unless I had to run it everyday then it's the Porsche :)
There’s absolutely no way that Porsche is making only 650 hp!
Porsche is fast but Ferrari And Lamborghini are on another level, much higher.
Porsche 911 !!!!Brilliant
Lambo "red lighted" first race, Ferrari "red lighted" second race.
False start Yani
Turbo S -  undisputed class.
An Excellent Piece of Engineering Porsche 911 Turbo S
812
All that noise and revving and the Porsche just beat them both, 🤣🤣 Lamborghini is ugly AF and the Ferrari is.....why is it so big? 🤣🤣Would take that Porsche all day long
Porsche. The best and best all round car.
Porsche: "This is what you call silent  but deadly."
I'd take the Porsche anyday
Porsche 911 all the way!
Único jeito de não levar pedradas na estrada é andando na frente
Only the 812 sounds like music. It's blasphemy to compare a Ferrari sound to something so inferior. It's like Aretha Franklin vs Dr Alban. I think it's also time for an upgrade. 400 m drag is not relevant for a good car. Do some laps in the rain?
Ferrari or Porsche, they're both fantastic beautiful cars
Porsche is the car made with numbers. Italians ones are made with passion, style, design, heart. The emotion they can arise  is something that pure speed and performances can not measure.
A prime example of money not being everything
Always Porsche!
Clear winner, 911 Turbo S
911 Turbo S all day long! I'm a Ferrari guy...but the everyday use and reliability of the Porsche ...makes it for the looks! performance it's better anyway!
Porsche sounds the best! I mean it!! And it won!!
I didn't know you are good at different European accounts. Good
I'd have the 812 Superfast!
Ferrari 812 Superfast 🙏
Those accents. Lol.
I’d have the Porsche. Just because it’s the BEST car! 😍
Omfg that Ferrari sounded like a f****** jet.....
Germany its hero 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Ferrari
Porsche Baby, what a beast, end of story!!!
Porsche every time
Wow that was close race but the Porsche kicked your asses.
Aventador SVJ
The Ferrari 488 Pista is a better car for a drag race
Porsche
PORSCHE 👍 bang for the buck
Funny how Yanni doesn’t even care about the Porsche
I bet the Ferrari would win if it had 4wd
The porsche 911 Turbo is the king of acceleration. It's well known that it is the car that accelerates and brakes the best of all, which gives it incredible merit. The traction with the weight of the engine hanging from the rear axle (which dynamically is a disadvantage here's an advantage) and the all-wheel drive are the reason, both in pure acceleration and in braking.
11:32 Porsche driver's satisfaction look :D
Porsche, Ferrari, Lambo in that order.... Sorry Yanni
My picks:  Interior looks: Ferrari. Exterior looks and Sound: Lambo Speed: Porsche  My pick of the 3: Porsche, looks don't matter in a race.
Porsche😍
Ze germans ask you to pronounce "Porsche" ze correct way.
I'd have the Ferrari.
lambo is best
Y'all need a Bugatti there
I would still go with the 812 if I had the money 💰💰
I love the channel I enjoyed very best strong drag racing with high super cars but we didn't see McLaren cars Aston Martin cars Lamborghini old cars I think it's comes boring little  bit we had watching Lamborghini aventador so many times like Tesla p100d vs McLaren mp4-12c, Zonda vs gtr35 I hope so it happens not only Lamborghini thank you guys about good video in channel
i’ll definitely take the 911 turbo.. value for money 💰
I expected the lambo to do better considering its the supercar and the ferrari is the gt. but the porsche just punching way above its weight.
The intro is legendary. The reasons I come to this channel is because of Matt.
we have an old fiat on a 1.5-liter engine with a turbine prepared for drag racing rides 8.8 seconds 1/4 mile, this is 7-10 hulls faster than all these Porsches and Ferrari)))
I could have the Porsche
Porsche do the better car with the lowest price.
Ferrari 812
911!
Shows you how good that Porsche is!👌
Linus?
What a race! More like SVJ vs 812 🤣 put that Porsche to bed
I would like to have the 812
Porsche!!!!
Possibly the porsche. Can use it everyday. The other two may catch in fire even if Lamborghini is made by audi.
Here are some other overpriced things! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBZ43fh032k
Can we just take a minute and appreciate Porsche engineers ‼️
I can’t believe the Porsche Turbo S is not loud. I have a base carrera and that thing screams and roars and crackles. Strange!
I prefer quite cars lol 😂
Lamborghini Aventador is the best
911 all day. Awesome!
Porsche 911 any and everyday :-)
911 is God
I would have the Ferrari
I  would definitely chose the Ferrari as my car it looks so Nice and sounds great
Porsche 911 TS
SSSSOOOOOOOOOOO close between the lambo and the ferrari but both to slow for the porsche anyway  xD
Id take the Porsche 1000%
Lambo jump two times.... bad loser driver...
911 will always be my fave and the best, but the fararri sounded best for sure.
Do a drag race with this Lamborghini against a McLaren 720s
Get a 911 gt2 rs on the channel  plzzzz
Porsche just better
Porsche is really underdog
My favorite Lamborghini songs like real spots car🏁
Lambo all days😍😍😍
i want the SVJ
The Porsche is a beast! What a beautiful machine. This is a cool 2nd place video.
Aventador looks bettter
Porsche was the best!!! 911 Carrera S 2020
jaki opalony Mat
Frankly should have put a little écu remap stage one for the porsche and see if doesn't just break the sound barrier,
Aventador svj
Svj
Lamborghini
Lamborghini in Brazil. R$ 2.000.000,00
I prefer the Porsche out of these three, it is humble, low-profile, high quality, good looks, decent enough practicality, and super damn fast, it can be a family daily driver, and it can tear up the racetrack
Porsche is simply amazing.
i love this channel
Porsche 911 Turbo
MATT do (Porsche 911 GT2RS vs. 911 TURBO S)😁
Porsche
Porsche
812 super fast
ferrari 812 vs mclaren 720s vs lamborghini aventador svj
I like how yianni's main goal is just to beat mat and that's that
The 911 is just awesome, not about numbers (even the price)... well done
As Tom Cruise said back in 1983 (37 yrs ago)..."Porsche, there is no substitute"
@5:23..Yanni Jumped...typical.
Tbh I would chose the ferrari
That Porsche is super impressive!!!
That Porsche 😎🙌🏻
Porsche
That Porsche stole the show 🤙👌
812 is just special, id pick it over nd over.
Lamborghini please
I much prefer the subtle sounds of the Porsche, feel free to downvote me! I cannot stand the high pitched wasp-like shriek of the Lamborghini. I'm the type who prefers a deep, beefy engine note on both cars and motorbikes... and don't get me started on fake noise, how pathetic is anyone who wants that? I open my windows to hear my little pocket rocket.
Ferrari 812 is my pick.
Porsche is 100% better and is just a sleeker car
How about Porsche 911 Turbo S vs La Ferrari? @carwow
Lambo is outdated, Ferrari looks better
Can we just appreciate the smile on everybody's  faces.
Ferrari any day over glorified beetle and audi made lambo :D
Porsche
Porsche for sure!
Love this car, but I beat the horse... seriously ? Does he know the Porsche has a Stuttgart horse :))on it
https://youtu.be/L7Tc2vtL8AA and these go well with either cars
It's really difficult to not take the Porsche and I'm Italian. When you look at all factors the only thing the Italians have is exclusivity but in terms of performance and price for performance, you cannot beat the 911 and it JUST GETS BETTER!
It's PorschUH.! Not Porsch. And that's a Hell of a fast one... Leaving the Italian Stallions behind. I'd have that one. Going for German reliability and speed. The Porsche doesn't blare, it uses that energy for performance instead of noise
Porsche is "hold my beer" car. Price, power, beauty.
I’m sure some people get a migraine from Yanni’s totally hilarious screaming antics, and maybe get irritated with his cap, tatts, jewelry and generally clawssy get-up, but I can’t imagine why.
I'm buying a Porsche :D
So it’s 1 fiat vs 2 volkswagens
Ferrari sounds Best ♥️♥️
ferrari >lambo
Give me that Ferrari over the others any day of the week
Porsche any day... Yes I did just say that :)
The Porsche
Should do 812 vs 720s
besides I would get that Turbo S it's Silent Killer
I like the way Yanni jogs forwards every gear change lol
Germans ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
V12 Music to my ears!!
Porsche all the way.
This is one of your best and intresting Videos
Turbo s
Loved that Lamborghini JUMPSTART
I would own the Lambo, just because I've been a fan since I was a kid, but that Porsche is wicked
would have the porsche
Porsche : let your success make the noise
The Aventador🇮🇹 sounds amazing in interior and exterior
Turbo s vc 720s or 765lt
Amazing Porsche!
Even though the Lambo couldn't make it against the Porsche I still love it SVJ my dream car, like if yours too👍👍👍❤️❤️
Yo Richthofen is that you
Wouldn't go near that lambo tbh
I prefer Porsche. It's quickest and better track car.
Saluti dall'Italia Mat!
812 is really impressive 🔥🔥🔥
Drag race McLaren 720s and Aventodor SVJ 🙏🙏🙏
The aventador SVJ is the improved Version Of the Aventador SV
Porsche duhh
Ferrari
Thats why only to buy german cars
If you want it loud, it’s got to be whatever yanni’s driving.
Definitely the Porsche. But styling and sound I really liked and got mad with the Bull
Porsche: You don't need a big engine... Just some good Deutsche Technik (German Engineering)
Porsche
Turbo S, for sure
Why did they even bring the Porsche?
I would take 911 please :)
Ferrari: im the fastest Lamborghini:No i am Porsche: hold my beer
I would buy the Porsche all the way. Yannimize is to obsessed with Lamborghini
SVJ
Der Porsche 911 turboS hat meiner Meinung nach das beste Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis.
Leave a like if the Ferrari 812 "Superfast" is a lie.
For me it would be Ferrari.
the aventador has a weak point, its gearbox is significantly slow
Lamborghini sounded awesome.
991 all day any day.
911 Understatement Gentlemans like 👌
If I have that money, obviously Porsche, always Porsche!! :)
This ferarri 🌶👌🤩🤩
The Porsche
German
Porsche is legit magic with this one
in love with Yanni's expressions, when he beats the sh*y outta Matt
Thought we were in carwow italia at first
That Porsche is crazy, I’ll keep it 😎
Awesome Porsche! In the first run I think Yanni jumped the start
Turbo>na all day long
So his name is Walter
And yet I bet you’d never dare do an impression if someone from the BAME community Matt.....
Ferrari gained and for beeing two wheeldrived it is Really fast 😧 imagine 4 wheldrive 😉
Ferrari 🙏👍🔴
Just 650 HP. Yes, it’s Porsche engineering ladies and gentlemen...
Porsche destroyed them both‼️
SVJ
How many horsepower did that Turbo S pack?! It can't be 650hp, can it?!
There is nothing better in sports cars than a Porsche, the italian mills can only be used to drive in front of the pub.
The 812 superfast
SVJ all day, mad super car proper childish poster and I am a 25 year old child. It’s like a big daft dog and who doesn’t want that. Ferrari is classy though, Porsche is abit boring looking. Don’t get how it’s so fast damn 😂
Porsche  hands down.
That's why Audi came with Porsche engine
Money no object? I'd have the Ferarri, just because I think it looks the best.
You should be presenting Top Gear ... much better than those dull twats!
The 911 gt2 rs vs 911 turbo s that'll be sick
Lambo costs more than twice the Porsche and trailed it?  How utterly lame is that?   The Porsche actually left the Lame-bo for dead.
Ferrari is king, lambo is toy
The Porsche is always the best. I'd like to get one
I’ll have the 812
The prancing horse sounded the best.
812superfast the best 💪😍👑
812 for me
Come on, oh no. The definition of yanni
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ by a mile
That Porsche ohhhh my goodness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Whos here before 2.5mil views?
Porsche is freaking fast tho
If you first  or If your last most importantly no one asked
Avantador SVJ
911 all day!
Honestly I'd have the 812. It's the most elegant looking car there and it has a V12.
You're comparing 2 pretty extreme track performance cars against a grand tourer. What did you expect? Of course the acceleration and braking will be worse.
Porsche 911 Turbo S, I Like to Have...
Casual Racism brought to you by car wow
812 imo sounded the best. The Porsche sounds like a vacuum cleaner so fuck the EU.
991.2 gt3 rs my choise for sure! :)
Porsche. Obviously.
That accent made me laugh so hard !
Lamborghini
When there’s a Lambo... there’s a Yianni
Porsche every day thanks!
The Ferrari and Lambo are worth double, have much bigger names and look amazing.. But the Porsche legit kicked their ass
Ferrari!
Lamb and Ferrari are only about loud exhaust than speed. Well done Porsche 😂😂😂
Porsche all day everyday 💪🏾
Porshe is just ignored
yes porsche fast
Porsches are always ignored by "kids, newbie petrol head, other fanboys", because they're not loud and in your face.   They are perfection: fast, efficient and surgical weapons.   But ya know, that doesn't boost ego's on Instagram like a GREEN LAMBO with Bitcoin stickers!  bahahahaha :D
Silence is a key to success                      -Porsche-
Has no one talks about That Porsche is like a silent killer
Ferrari super fast easy
I would buy a g63 & a turbo s for the price of a svj.
The best is Lamborghini aventador svj
This porsche is the cheapest one and for me the best one here
Damn the Lambo sounds amazing.
Ferrariii in Italian acsent
Have you guys dragged a tesla roadster yet?
Lamborghini is the best
If you want to prove someone 'THE LAW OF DIMINISHING RETURNS' Show them this video. Porsche 911 turbos: THE BEST HYPERCAR WHICH ISN'T A HYPERCAR.
Porsche is most worth it.
Porsche! Porsche! Porsche! Porsche! HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
911 Turbo S !  Great accents at the start Mat..
812 superfast the best
the usual. 4 minutes of waffle and nonsense, and then the drag race starts.
PORSCHE TURBO S💪💪💪💪
I like lambo and Porsche but Ferrari is love 😍
When i See Lambo I see Yianni
nice video .. thanks and greetings from Germany
Ferrari sound better
Mat you know the drag race u did with the pista, 720s, and the sv. Do the upgraded version such as 765lt, f8 tributo, and svj
pista destroys all
Ferrari/Bat Mobile
i have a lambo SVJ
Well there is an idiot on youtube (KA) claiming his stage2 335d with 400hp runs 10.8sec 1/4mile 🤦‍♂️ can someone go and explain him...
SVJ to Turbo S - I will let you win this time!!!
Lambo is the best looking machine in the world!
These are nice and fast cars not sUpRa tHaT cOmEs wItH 1000 Hp sToCk. JDM's are hurendous
PORSCHE is like silent gentlemen!
lambo sounded best
Porsche is the best 💪👍
If it’s Ferrari 812 n-largo...Perfect !
Aventador. Always has been my fav car and always will be. also the svj is the fastest production car around the nurburgring
The 812 is the best looking car by a mile😂
Thanks mat this is the challenge that I want.
I’ll go with The turbo S!
Porsche <3
PORSCHE 992 turbo S 🔥
Porsche - silent but violent
Can anybody on EARTH just give the dual clutch transmission and a twin turbo to all the Avvvveeeennnntaaaaaadorrrsssss!!!!!......It definitely can do much much much more......🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
The 812 isn’t even the lightweight version yet...IMAGINE
Porsche ❤️ 100k cheaper than the Ferrari  200k cheaper than the lambo
A Ferrari fan But I'd still have the 911
The porsche won everything but if i had the money,.. it would be the 1) lambo, 2) ferrari and 3) ....anything else.  Porsches look down right boring and ugly.
Matt you are too funny
Better looking car the Ferrari.  Slightly better noise the Lambo plus Yanni behind the steering wheel is always a plus. Better CAR the Porsche. Simple.
Funniest start of a carwow drag race video yet. I laughed so much, thank you Mat!:)
Really guys ? I know people who can do it in 0.8 less
911 for me shes beautiful. More t For people who dont want to be famous just the fastest 😂
Nobody: Car: tire pressure warning  Mat: let's do a brake test
If i had endless money i would have Lambo. If i really need to choose = Porsche
What was Porsche thinking with those ugly ass rims? F12 all day.
Remember how they laugh at the german but the german destroyed the Italians
3.8 porsche 6.2 ferrari and eventador best best porsche ❤️
People who know how Porsches sounds, will definitely know that the Porsche sounds very good
Which means that the next GT2RS will annihilate the rest
Fezza 💯
Hello! Gostaria de ver o FERRARI 488 PISTA vs PORSCHE  911 TURBO S.
Porsche is the fastest and lighter car of all, however the SVJ is a racetrack car, it has a lot of drag because of its huge downforce. Not for nothing it has records over records on the race tracks like nordschleife... The quarter mile in 10.4 is still pretty good...
Porsche 911
Lambo SVj won
ferrari all the way
Svj
Matt I would like to see P1 up against the King 👑 911 turbo s
Porsche for president!!!
911 with a manual and you guys can keep drag racing all you like while I hit the twisties.
Lambo all day long.The Porsche is just so dull like most german cars
Lamborghini aventador svj vs ferrari pista
5:23, yianni cheats so bad
I'd have the turbo s all the way. Loved that car for a long time
Best looking car is the Ferrari but clearly the BEST car there is the Porsche. Jeeez , that thing is fantastic for it's price.
Brah definitely buying the Ferrari (if money ain't an object.) Lambo's cool too, but too loud for me.
Love the porsche no1 ever brings it up but its so blimmin quick and with half the engine capacity
Plz drag race ..M8 competition  vs m8 gran coupe competition  vs m8 convertible  competition
Just lamborghini 😍😍❤❤💯💯
German engineering>>>>>> italian engineering
@carwow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im2eYuGdmfY
Porsche - the best! Cheapest, but look how it goes from the start line in drag race! I6 vs V12 shows everything that we need to see in this battle :D
Ferrari every day
Its possible to get the carbon balance for each try ?
Would love to see the Porsche driver's point of view, and it would definitely be my everyday car.
Yianni at end : lets beat the ferrari you know we dont care about PORSCHE             DIRECTED BY ROBERT B WEIDE
KIDS : lambo is the most good looking car MEN: ferrari is the most good looking car LEGENDS: porsche is the best car also good looking             Obviously legends understand everything
Lamborghini svj
I would have a Lamborghini dude obviously
Between these 3 cars, definitely the Lamborghini....
Ferrari👌
Rari is mf brand it's totally trash his owner had ego crushed by legendary Lamborghini
992 turbo S - hands down
I have loved Porsche since I was a kid, but would take the SVJ. Then sell it for Porsche 918 spyder.😄
Ferrari and lamborghini are Tony Montana, the Porsche is the assassin who quietly blows them into the afterlife.
If I could have any of these cars from the video but I didn’t have to pay for it I would get the Lambo SVJ so I could sell it and buy 2 Porsches
Ferrari Lamborghini Porsche in the good looking department
911 👍👍👍
Ferrari is by far the best looking car, 2nd place is the Porsche. No adult man would choose the Lambo...
Poooorschhhe
Porsche.  Always and forever.  Let the Ferraris and Lamborghinis be passed around from one non-driver to the next with perennially low mileage readings on their odometers.  Too precious and finicky for daily use.  After all, are we talking about cars or garage decor?  :-)
German power 💪
Money no object: I'd take the ferrari honestly. I love the looks of it
Lamborghini & Ferrari just ate Porsche’s smoke and dust! Bruh!
Porche!!! 🙌🏽
911 Ops what about 918 🤣
Porsche 911
Ferrari is by far the best
porsche soudns tragic lol
Lamborghini any day
Next video: drag car vs Porsche turbo S lol
5:22
That's Porsche is CRAZY!
Yannie: I wear Lambo's cap Matt: I wear Ferrari cap Porshe: I just wear...a victory crown
3:45. i like the rev sound inside the ferrari
The Porsche counts the other 2 don't. They will never be equal to a porsche. for it's ability 2 put power 2 the ground. Or even more important it's handling on open roads. these tests of power tell you nothing about what a car is capable of. I think this straight line shit is a waste of time . 2 be honest i'm getting sick of it. i would prefer 2 watch all those ring masters anyday
The Porsche and Ferrari are pure class. If I want something flashy I’d get a GT3RS or a 488 Pista, never a Lamborghini
That into 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yaani braked earlier but that Porsche... Still the king!
I would have a 812 superfast bc its my dream car
Seems like horses always win
Wouldn't mind seeing more Astons drag racing in the future! Superleggera vs Bentley Continental GT!
9110 or 812 any day
Next video Bugatti Chiron 300+ vs Koenigsegg Agera Rs
Only losers need to show off with the sound.
SVJ all the way! Hands down the most savage looking car. Porsche is amazing. So underrated. The super fast is not the right Ferrari for this. Bring the F8 and let’s see how this pans out.
Race Chiron vs Regera 2019 vs agera. Maybe the best video for you
Ferrari
I’d love the 911. But probably the Ferrari.
Id choose the Porsche, my goodness wat a car...
Sleeper:  The 911 in this company.
Exhaust sound means nothing...   Porsche... The greatest engine created
It was a drag race just between the Lamborghini and the Ferrari. The Porsche was there just to make both those cars feel bad about themselves. 😄
The Porsche is perfection ! It does everything right .. How can anyone argue that ?
Porsches like bye bye
SVJ!!!!!!!💨💨💨
Money no object?!?!?!?! Porsche for sure lol
Even at the same price I'd have the Porsche.  The fact that it's by far the cheapest and best car makes it a no brainer.
Porsche always Porsche!
Porsche all the way, that Lambo ugly as fuc! Thanks Matt.
FINALLY WE CAN SEE THE CARWOW GIRL'S FACE PROPERLY
The porsche is op lol to be fair though porsche are making moves
Germans for the win.
He said lets talk about the bull beating the horse but technically the Porsche is a horse too sooooo
I haven't seen the video yet, but the 911 Turbo by 3+ car length over the Lambo with the 812 close behind. Porsche has the latest and greatest AWD and transmission and twin turbos, the Lambo is 2012 tech complete with single clutch transmission and the 812 is front engine, rear drive and doesn't have a hope in hell either (although it has a very good dual clutch transmission)...let's see if i was right...
Give me the SVJ all day
Lamborghini Aventador svj
812 super fast 🤟🏻💯
Porsche 911 was like that kid in school who gets bullied and then became a billionaire.
Just race all the Porsche variants against each other. Ferrari and Lamborghini can’t keep up.
I'd have the ferrari, then porsche, then lamborghini
I'm a grown man with responsibilities and sense. 911.
The turbo S
I'm starting to think your a dam nazi.
Lexus vs C8 homeboy.
Porsche 911 Turbo S but who was driving!?
911 the only choice
5:24 for the race
So we getting a Porsche now okay cool
I would have the Lamborgini to sale it and than I would by 2 of the Porsche
Porsche and it wasn’t even the GT2RS
legend drag racing
The irresponsible me would take the Lambo.  The responsible me would take the Porsche.
This just proves turbo is superior to na
I love the SVJ but imma have to take the 812 Superfast
i wanna lambo but i like you mat
Porsche 👌🏼
Ferrari jumped the start in race 2
LAMBO!
Ferrari 812 Sort of Fast
How highly technical is Porsche, that’s insane
The new 911 turbo S is 🔥
Ferrari
the Turbo S exactly
The Porsche was really impressive
SVJ 812 SOUND BETTER
Ferrari always sucks
Porsche 911
911T sounds like a vacuum cleaner in the company of these V12 monsters
I want the 812
shorturl.ca/girlxxchat412i    පැත්තෙන් පැත්තට සිට පසුව අවට බලා බය පසුව
That’s why I love The turbo S it’s a mini Bugatti veyron
911 turbo s is not even in the same class. GT2 RS would be the equivalent...
911
I hate when top comment ruins the race
yanni jumps the line too lmao
Pambo svj all day any day like if u agree to boest in matts face
Il mamadore dil ferrari
Turbo S is literally not real 😍 easy dub
That porsche is made by German(actually aliens' technology)
Superior porsche !! 👍👍👍
Yaani jumped the start line in the drag
I just get excited every time Carwow posted a video featuring the 911 Turbo S because you know it's going to be a good one
Yanni, I’d take the 812 all day😉🤪🤣
Super fast I would pick
Farrari looks best. Disappointed in performance. Time they make a Porsche killer.
Sp sound awesome
Ferrari is marginally slower, sounds better, AND you can go on a 2000 mile road trip with luggage and be fine💪🏻
Ferrari sounds best hands down
That 812 is so sexy 😍😍
Porsche 911 turbo s
Hahahahaha los acentos Italinos y Alemán 😹
I Like it, thisPorsche 911 🥰💪🏾 The King
I rather have the porch
That porsche with 150 less hp and it walks all over them it really just leaves me admiring porsche engineering so much.
991. love the 911 it’s not a show off
812
Wow the Porsche 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥but still 🖤 the Ferrari
991. love the 911 it’s not a show off
2 Million views in one day! Nice!
Porsche all day.
Turbo S please
lambos hi rev are orgasmic
😂😂😂😂😂 Italian & Germany accent
Porsche 911 anyday
Lamborghini
The 812 looks the best, but I’m going with the Turbo S. You can drive it every day and then take it to track and bang on cars that cost significantly more and look more badass.
taking the ferrari over the lambo any day
Yanni's friend never let anyone drive his car until Yanni and he does donuts in the man's car...Also the only car that's not German out of the three is the Ferrari.
Horse And  Bull beaten by a Frog
Flat 6 cylinder vs  V12 cylinder
This is one of the best videos you guys have made! Thanks! Keep up the great work!!!
Ferrari
It's the SuperFast for me
That Yanni dude cheats on every single one of these drag races. He cheats on the brake tests. Not sure why you'd keep having him in these contests because you can just discount anything the car he is in is doing.
911
I'm not really the only one who thinks that the nice, quiet Porsche is the only one they would actually want to own, right?  I've had loud cars and I love my nice, quiet 911.
Mat porche 911 turbo s 🆚 maclaren 720S
Porsche.
Yani legit jumps the light every single time 🤦🏼‍♂️
SVJ🥵
Can we address the fact the he drifted an all wheel drive lamborghini
Porsche
The thing is that lambo will crush them if this race goes for longer
The SVJ all the time, it's the best looking car.
Porsche 911, sexier than my girlfriend ❤
Porsche torture aliens to get those technology
The super fast is wickedly fast. if it had 4wd it would have won. I will have The Lamboghini SV anyway
SVJ all day
Im a Ferrari guy. My favorite car is the Laferrari
Matt. Your shit off the line.
Ferrari could make it
Definitely the Porsche
GET FREWWWW!!!!
Lambo sounds best. But would own the 911 turbo s everyday of the week. Best looking car of the lot
I will never ever choose any other sports car over a Porsche, never.  With only 6 cylinders Porsche engineers know exactly what they are doing and what they want to achieve. Go! Porsche.  This race was not about which car sounds better but which car was faster.  Go Porsche Go!
911 for sure!
Nothing is better than a Porsche. Everyone need to know that
Porsche 911
Love your videos Mat and love Yanni, viva la Porsche
omfg the 992 isthe best
Yanni cheated the start on the first race but still couldn't win oof
I would want the lambo the most. The SVJ is actually my dream car
Do an ultimate Porsche drag race with '21 911 Turbo S, GT2RS, 918, and Taycan Turbo S
360.000 for a car that's slower than a car half that price ... must be an idiot to buy it
أرزاق لو حد مصري قدم البرنامج ده دمه هيكون أخف منك بكتيييييييير .... الإنجليز معروفين 😂😂😂
Porsche for me....it’s better in every way - go anywhere in either of the other two (despite how wonderful they are) and you can’t help being seen to be shouting ‘look at me’!....that’s a problem for me.
812 all day, stunning looking car
AND THE PORSCHE WON!?
A Lamborghini a Ferrari and a vacuum. This should be fun to watch
Wow Porsche 911 turbo s!! What engineering!!
The most impressive thing was matts accents   WHAATT? 😱😱😱
1) SVJ 2) 812 3) 911 With the exception of the GT2RS & GT3RS, every Porsche looks the same accept to Porsche fans. And frankly, they're boring. Fun to drive, but meh to look at.
812
Da lambo
Forex and bitcoin trading??
Porsche, even with 120/150 hp less than its opponents, always wins... The exhaust is not great but porsche is the best car of all I love Porsche😍😎
Lamborghini: "I'm the fastest car!" Ferrari: "No, I'm the fastest car!" Porsche looking in the rearview mirror: "Bye-bye, girls!"
funny fact, the accents were pretty on spot
El mejor de todos es mi favorito Porsche 911 👏👏👏🇩🇴🇩🇴
Why you never Race Koeinegsegg or Bugatti?
Which car you better have out of the three with money not being an impediment?  Still, the Porsche.  Hands down the better all around sports car, cheaper and easier to drive everyday.  Just because you have money doesn't mean that I would go around spending it on an SVJ or a Ferrari. Don't get me wrong. Love the looks of the SVJ and that Ferrari is just pure class, albeit slow off the line. Owning them? ehh, no.
Porsche
I would have the Porsche 911 turbo s now
Porsche all day.  I'm all about function, not fashion.
Hahaha 🤣🤣...the cheapest car beats the two more expensive cars
The funniest thing would be to somehow get a jesko/agera rs or a regera and watch it aboslutely destroy the 992
Of course Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, and I am a big fan of Yanni as well, All Day Lambo ❤️
It's a 911 Turbo S. Unless it has the word "Bugatti" or "Mclaren" on the other car I'm not too worried. Faster, less expensive, cheaper to run, stronger residual value...and more fuel efficient. DAMN.
SVJ for Me
Porsche understated and classy ! Stealth like on the Autobahn ! The other two would look better parked at some nouveau riche shopping mall in Dubai! 😂
812
Turbo S all day. Easy.
Il mamadori di Ferrari verzione inglesa
I’ll take the Porsche any day
Protal
If money was no object, I would buy the SVJ, sell it, then buy a gt3rs and a turbo S
I’m a Porsche lover through & through and would choose the 911; however, that Lambo is sexy.
Porsche all around and with half money Silent Punisher shows the way
Svj, best around Nurburgring, looks dopest, sounds best, and idk just amazing
Porsche
What does Yianni do to afford all them motors !?
È abbastanza penoso il vostro modo di imitare il nostro accento
id have svj
Definetly I would own ferrari
Ferrari 👌🏼
Isnt that Lamborghini famous on Instagram ? Tacky as hell too like every single lambo account 😂
Two Volkswagen (VW) against one FIAT... 😂😂
Yanni’s pure aggression is brilliant
812
That Turbo S is just other-worldly. There's magic in every single horsepower.
5:25 Tell the moron in the Lamborghini that the "test" is useless if he quick start it *everytime*...!  (And everybody sees it, so everybody knows your a idiot...)
I’d have the Ferrari no doubt
Remember the days Yanni would say "what Porsche?"
Please  Hold   a drag race between accent ,yaris,honda city, nissan versa
I would have the Porsche 911
Ouch!  Porsche exposes that super cars aren’t.
650hp... and the lie detector test determined... that was a lie.
Left side brain says "Porsche Turbo" for all the obvious reasons; Right side brain says "Porsche Turbo, but that Ferrari is so sexy!" Heart screams " Tu si pozzo FERRARI par sempre!"
Anyone notice Yianni jump the start on the first drag race? A base 812 is holding on to the specialist top dog lambo and a basic standard 911 Turbo S is drilling the both of them! Says it all! Well done Porsche, classy as always.
I would absolutely have the Ferrari. Sexy black color with yellow brakes calipers.
@porchecentersd porque siempre ha sido un experto poniéndoles en la madre automóviles que le doblan en precio, felicidades Germany 🇧🇪
McLaren😀😀😀😀
LAMBORGHINI SVJ ALL LIFE LONG
If I had to buy a sportscar I wouöd definately buy a Porsche! best styling and it has style!
Sitting here wishing yanni was my friend..smh
I would take the Porsche cause I don’t want attention until I clap someone in a drag race
Can we see a drag race where the porsche actually loses
I’d take the new Porsche 911 Turbo S hands down!
This is the best carwow video I have seen! I love you, Mat(and Yianny)!
Bollocks !
The pride of winning is so intense lol, love it 👍
That Porsche can quite easily be made to sound awesome.
Why you dont take the Porsche 911 Turbo 4S he has 700hp? And the Porsche has Sound but only in the Race Mode and with the Performance Exhaust
Porsche❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
650 hp & 800 NM from 3.8 L!! What a machine (Clarkson voice)
Porsche best car hands down!
Porsche of course
Porsche, with only 650HP.  Tune it, to make 700-750hp, and it'll crush 'm even more!
Lambo every day
Why did you have to get cringy
Porsche....
SVJ vs 488 Pista vs GT2RS vs 720s
Svj
Lambo sounds the best! But I would take the Porsche just because is fast in the drag race.
Looks Ferrari, Performance Porsche.
It just amazing me the 911 has half the cylinders and can beat them both.
812 is the better looking, best sounding imo, fastest once rolling and the best drivers car because of rear wheel drive All of that can be discussed and depends on opinions and taste but the 812 would definitely be my pick!
A Porsche feis bonito de todo jeito 😎😎😎
Porsche is the old money, classy persons car.   Ferrari is the bachelors tasteful supercar.  Lamborghini is the flash in the pan YouTubers "look at me, look at me".
The dumb horse started on 60mph. Not 50
Porsche l
The Europeans and their engineering 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
That 911did it for me .
Replace the Porsche with a mclaron 720s
I personally would get the porsche 911 Turbo S but i love the way the 812 looks and sounds above all!
Ferruccio Lamborghini will come back alive from heaven if he see a Lambo loosing from a Ferrari.
As someone who finds 70% of Porsches boring, I must say that the 911 Turbo is one amazing car!
So, you compare 3 supercar in a 1/4 of mile and a big part of you think that Porsche is better.  Put them on a track and let see what Porsche can do.  I tell you strait away that Porsche gonna lose very fast
I would Buy 911
Must be humiliating for Ferrari & Lambo, not to mention embarrassing. Well done Porsche.
Kudos to that Porsche
I would get 2 Turbo S. One regular and one convertible for the SVJ money.
Very interesting from 50... Ferrari wins!
Porsche turble s
Porsche  Love it
LAMBO ✌🏻
Three amazing cars, but that Porsche is what I want, honest, humble, quality, everything, bullet fast.....I want.
Ferrari looks better It sounds better SVJ may sound louder but not better than the Rari
To be honest best looking car is Ferrari but I will go for Porsche
812 Superfast for sound!
812 superfast 🤩
How many are waiting for Chiron?
That Porsche is no joke.
That Porsche.
LAMB0!!!
Porsche
Ferrari and Lamborghini: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Porsche:                                        Won!
Porsche said just see my speed...you will know why they call me 911...heheeee
That black Ferrari just looks jaw dropping!
I would have a Lamborghini SVJ what am I talking about I already own one
Naci races
Ferrari still a Ferrari.
That Porsche is no joke ! The germans meant business when they made it.
I would buy the porsche and a house
F E R R A R I T E A M
Porscheeeeeeee!!!!Not Porsch :-/German Name,and the Best Car !
All I gotta say is OMG that 911
Honestly, Porsche is my all-time favorite,  but in this case, I'm all 812 Superfast. Which looks better than the other two nice looking supercars. Sorry Lambo😁
For sure the 911!!!
911
Porsche 👑
Yanny at 4:56 😂😂
I'd have the Porsche all day long.
Porsche
The sound of a Aventador launching is one of the best sounds i ever heard in my life.
Turbo better fight with turbo engine cars. NA engine is whole different playground. I have Porsche anyday because German really good making sports cars.
Lamborghini cheated off the line? But subtle Wins the day, noisy exhausts are for people who feel they have to show off, as my wife says, a noisy exhaust has never made a woman cum yet!
Can we focus on the Porsche next time since it crushed the porn cars?!
Porsche🔥
SVJ sell it and then buy a 911
lambo
If this was a 1 mile it would've been a battle between the 812 and the svj
you are happy today not crazy as usual but happy
Lamborghini SVJ is better
you had your arses handed to you by a beetle!
Ferrari's V12 all day. Nothing sounds more beautiful
you've got to lol at Yanni's face when "it's not quite going as he hoped" 🤣🤣🤣
when do we get to see the 765lt?
More boring content than watching a cactus to grow
Porsche! Only Porsche...
Porsche 911 Turbo S!!
The Porsche all the way
Ill take Porsche anything dont need the fancy looks
Sta to trka na pravcu tacno dokazuje?! Izadjite na stazu i bice jasnije zasto je Ferrari dobio naziv "superfast"!
911 all de way
ferrari 812
Love the sound of the Lambo and Porsche
Porsche's win is making me uncomfortable,
Gt 63s performaster vs BMW m8 competition vs rs7
Obviously the Porsche is the best. German, cheaper, quicker, and lasts longer than Lambos /especially the older Gallargo/.  So the quietest, car with the less vinyls on it is the best, according to these tests.  A new Ferrari had issues after one drag race.
Ever thought of a kid whose nerdy and quiet in room full of delinquents but beats the ass off of all the guys in a snap. That is what porsche is doing to this pony and bull 😂😂
Mats in the Batmobile
by far the best fucking Ep laugh my face off
Half the cylinders and half the price but destroys them regardless. Very impressive from Porsche.   ZE GERMAN ENGINEERING IS SUPERIOR
Yanni totally jumped the start on the first race
The Porsche is awesome.
Ah man the 720s instead of the porsche would be much better
porsche is the sexiest and the best
I'd have 812 any dayyyy🔥🔥🔥
Germany's cars for all time
Definetly the Porsche and you can make it Look good too
Porsche is porsche.. porsche just doesn't need more power, torq or weight advantage .. it could be icu or ev.. but its porsche.. 🥰
The 812 & SVJ gets girls, the 911 gets sausages... there’s some science to this statement
This shows @pedro (the amazing noob) that this Turbo S is NOT overpriced!!!
Porsche 👍👍
Porsche 911
Porsche
Love the Ferri! Love Ferrari sound, seems and old F1! But... Porsche is the best! As usually...
if i had the choice between those three cars i would take the svj just to sell it an buy an Porsche Turbo S
That Porsche isnt even the fastest. Pls try the 918spyder, or 991 gt2 rs  Those are rhe real MONSTERS
812 Ferrari is better
The Porsche is: -the fastest                              -the best braking                              -the cheapest                              -probably the most economical/good on tax because it has a smaller engine  But would we all not go for the lamborghini?
Is buy 2 Porches and you can have a Lambo, what a great car
FERRARI F12 BELLA CIAO
That intro was perfect
Ferrari best looking, Lambo sounds the best. The best car is the PORSCHE. I’ll take any of them .  Great video guys
FERRARI F12 BELLA CIAO
Porsche
FERRARI F12 BELLA CIAO
That Porsche is the most insane car un the world considering how mucho ir costs
Svj
Great video but I would take the Ferrari over the others anytime🥰♥️
Ferrari def
Porsche all day, every day!  ☺
Porsche all day baby 🔥
PORSCHEREE
I would have the porsche. It's a confy daily driver and nice looking that beat all supercars! Just amazing how it performs
My car can't watch this 😭😂
Ferrari always 3 steps above all. Best look, best sound. It’s not a drag race car and it’s the only one RWD, but in a rolling race it smokes everyone ♥️🇮🇹♥️
The Porsche is just such an understated calm champion while the other 2 just make a big noise for nothing. Not to mention the huge pricing differences.
I was waiting for this ... one of the best drag races ever ... thank you Mat
The Porsche all day
Qualité deutch.
Hahahaha “I didn’t die which is great” - hilarious. I’d have the Porsche real world. Drives forever without trouble.
Porsche: Babyface Murderer
The PORSCHA is the reall MACHINE !!
The folks from Stuttgart know how to build cars!
British guys shouldn’t be allowed driving italian cars till they learn the basics of the pronouncing. 🤣 It is a Ferrari, not a FOVVAUI!
Lambo
🇮🇹
Fairly certain I saw a red light.
Damn, the 992 turbo is unreal. Kinda „understatement“, but the performance is nuts.
Aventator
The porsche is the best
Superfast for sure!!
Would like to see if there would be a difference if they raced a 488 Pista instead of the 812 Superfast. Would the results be the same?
German cars are the bests ❤️
I can’t wait to see the GT black series against the Porsche
I would like to own the Ferrari!
Lamborgini each day every day❤
PORSCHE 😍
for me it would be the 911
That TurboS is a while different beast!
Sorry, but the Ferrari both SOUNDS better and LOOKS better. But yeah, the Porsche is AWESOME!!
Porche sales gonna improve definitely soon, they should just concentrate on sound lil bit
Porche always of course
Lamborghini for ever
porsche is bug~hahaha
911 torpo S💜🚶🏽‍♂️
⁦✌🏻⁩⁦🤚🏻⁩🌺⁦🇶🇦⁩
The Bull beating the horse? Did not beat the Stuttgart horse tho 😎
McLaren T50 will eat these for breakfast
Every time I see Yanny he reminds me of watto from star wars
Would chose the porsche anyday...
911 turbo S vs Bugati Chiron???
Sorry to say it mate but I would take the svj and day
Italians are good with food, design and loud talks/faces (exactly like Matt and Yanni demonstrated)... It's a disgrace - 6.5L loses to 3.8L. Germans are the engineers, hands down.
i take the ferrari all dayyyy
At the end... Germany always winning. This Porsche is a monster! Wanna see the Porsche GT2 against the Turbo S.
911
Lamborghini, but only because of 4WD
Ferrari sounded the best
Ok fine fearrie bring the f1 out
Porsche all the way
The Fat Driver made the Lamborghini went slow ....
German engineers💪💪💪💪
The best episode
Sure the SVJ and sell it for two porsche hahaha...
Turbo S
I’m assuming people let them borrow their cars I would never let these morons drive my car
SVJ
The Porsche sounds the best all day long... :-)
Lol trash cars. Get a trackhawk😌
Porsche
I like how Mat and Yiannie are in their crazy expensive Supercars like: 😡😡 and the Porsche 911 driver is 2 cars ahead of them like: 🥱
Matt please do a leaderboard. At the least a top 20 leaderboard.
Porsche
Porsche doesn't play around. I love it.
Best sounding one was definitely the Lamborghini and of all three of them I would have the Lamborghini for sure
Made in Germany
5:22 SVJ totally jumped the start
Definitely Porsche!!!
Actually the porsche
It's a nightmare, the Aventador SVJ is by far the best looking car of the three, and certainly one of the top 5 of all cars, why do you think it's so popular!
Even though I’m not a lambo fan I would have to lambo
It’s a hard decision to have one
Idk, silence speaks louder than words so with that being said...     The Porsche sounded the loudest.
Porsche for sure. Cheaper, faster, better around a track.
Yes!!!! The Porsche won!!!!
Haven’t finished but I know that 911 turbo S got this
Yanny you are idiot 1/3 price of Lambo beating your. And you still talking about Ferrari 😅😂😅😂😅 shame
ماله حل البورش ❤️😍
Porsche is handbuilt by alliens
Flat 6 better than v12.
But the lambo :/
The Ferrari sounds best
As expected, turbo S is a supercars killer
Nobody comments on Yanni skipping start in the first race?
Everyone: BRRRRRRRR Yianny: COME ON!!!!!!!!  IYI  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Nailed those accents
SVJ VS Performante Plzzzz
Ferrari sounds better!!!
Porsche saying #Tesla no sound needed  Speed 🇩🇪 Yes..?
Porsche is just 1 big fucking cheat code😂😂
BTW Yianni must be great person he's so fuuny so excited every time:D Positive person !
I would have the 911. It performs the best, it’s the cheapest and I don’t agree with de hooligan, I think it looks incredibly sexy than Porsche
F12 SF
Lamborgini svj
only  156.000 :D just....
Does the 911 have a soft limiter? Because if not, I know it is louder than that. What was the Lambo's time (and 911's) on the first race? You always only report times from the race which gives you the most favorable time!!! 🧐
The lambo sound so fucking agressive
The Porsche wins this. £100k less and still more than hold’s it’s own. Amazing car.
Lambo all-day everyday
Porsche :)
German Engineering 💪😂
Forever Porsche🔥
I would have the porche or the 812 superfast
Porsche won.. Lamborghini sounds waaaay better
Ferrari 812 Superfast
Yanni jumped the line one race 1... so that Porsche actually won by a car length. I love Lambos, but that 911 Turbo S might be the best bang of your buck.
porsche ahahahaha
i'd take the porsche all day, everyday
ITIO GTO
I haven't watched the video yet but the I'm sure the Porsche took it...😅👍
Porche
Lamborghini: RAAAAARRRRR! Ferrari: RAAAAAARRRRR!  Porsche: empty utensils make the most noise.
Cringe lambo guy
812 super fast is my favourite car in the world it’s so nice
Porsche.
Porsche 911 (992) Turbo S on any given day! Apparently, it accelerates faster than 991 GT2 RS!
That Porsche is the definition of having the last laugh.
@carwow https://youtu.be/Im2eYuGdmfY
God, that new 911 turbo is such a fucking beast
I love love LOVE the Porsche 911 Turbo S!  Subtle. Silent. Very deadly! Spanker of Lambos, McLarens, Teslas, and Ferraris.  Porsche: “That was fun. Guess I’ll go food shopping and take it for a wash now.”
Porsche for me...at least it works every time you need it! And it is faster than everything for a reasonable price!
For this range of price, I’d get the Porsche in a more funky color. I’d really feel like losing by buying a more expensive, losing car.  I’m not a fan of the way Porsches look, especially the 911, but the quality and in this case the performance is top notch. It also seems more practical than, at least, the Lambo.
Matt: let's not talk about the Porche it doesn't sound good has half cylinders. Porsche : We will see about that mate.  Couple seconds later: The Porsche beat the Lamborghini and the Ferrari. Silence is the best answer 😎😎😎 That Porsche is blimey damn fast 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yianni is number one in jumping the starts. They should put a starting light and record the starts. That Porsche is no joke.
Ferrari looks best for me. And it's ridiculously quick on a roll.
Counting lady being shown is the real winner here 😅
The LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR SVJ is the better supercar
Y la traducción? Jaja
Ferrari sounded the best
Come on get Frew! GET FREW! 😭
the best car show on earth!!!, Mat always bring some heat
Porsche is a car from hell destroying nearly every car in the world
LamboRghini, not lamboghini... sooner or later someone  will pronounce it correctly
Porsche all the time killing both and that's just normal 🤣🤣🤣
Porsche
Of course Porsche - Cheaper and faster
Lambo still looks best
I want that 911 turbo S!!!
Yanni seems like a fool.
PORSCHE )))))
Porshe: you wanna see some real speed
jumpstart
For me three things are obvious: - the Porsche is the best (overall) - the Ferrari is the beauty - the Lambo is the car for people with certain deficiencies
i will forever be surprised how fast that porsche is
Porsche... There is no substitute. 😎
I definitely choose Porsche
Who else thought this was for a horizon 4 if you didn’t and I did then lmao lol
5:22 Your welcome.
Lambo and Ferrari got screwed. 🤣🤣 Porsche worth the money 👏👏👏
Porsche
Ferrari 812 is the one I'd have it's definitely the best looking car
i would pick the Porsche, for sure
Porsche is so much cooler... It matches the performance of the other 2 while being much cheaper and more subtle looking. I don't like "in yo eyes" cars that much. I'd take Porsche any day.
Porsche
No comparison SVJ shits in the mouth of the other two in almost every classification. Perfect 3 car garage tho. Superfast for gt cruising, Porsche for traffic light pulls around the city and the SVJ for the canyon runs. If I could only have one its the svj every day of the week.
I'd have the Porsche but I'm here for another matter: please at least try saying italian names the right way, they're not Lambogheeny and Farari with the english R sound, it's the italian R, and you all know how it sounds, like Torrrrrrtellini...well I know it's difficult but try saying them correctly, just to show that you can, I mean it's okay of you say them wrong in English but...please try😂
812
Why bring the Porsche? It's just going to win.  It's always a race for 2nd when a Porsche shows up.
The ferrari
I Love the Porsche 911 Turbo S
The Germans, man.......
@8:13 .. Realized that the Ferrari would have definitely won the first race against lambo if required tyre pressure was accurate enough.
That Ferrari is beautiful 😍
Fertari
Porsche everyday!!!
Check my channel too.
SVJ😍❤️
Porsche is just there as reference
Definitely that SVJ! Sorry Mat, but it just looks like a fighter jet and sounds so bloody brilliant!
Porsche number one always
Porsche. Cheapest, fastest, most elegant.  Others are for tossers
The Porsche sounds amazing....quiet but fast
It's not the fair comparison between lambo and Ferrari, SVJ is top hardcore version of aventador just wait for 812 GTO!!!! It will destroy SVJ @carwow should consider this.
Lamborghini best sound ever
How did you get someone to lend you that ferrari
Definitely Lamborghini Aventador SVJ  I'm with yanny 🤘🤘
5:20 please check that with 0.25X speed !!!
Lambo always... But that Porsche though, it really means business
Yianni cheated on the first drag race but still got smoked 💨 by the German car.
Porsche 911 turbo s all day every day
Porsche best supercar
I will put my money in the Porsche
6:17 Matt: Lets talk about the Porsche.. Yianni :  Noo! "We all know whats Porsche is about "  😅 Legend 👏
I would choose the Porsche 9 out of 10
The Ferrari
Porsche! 24-7
Thats not the sound of the turbo s watch other videos they trying to make it look stupid ;)
Not fair should have bought the Gt2 Rs and F12TDF if its SVJ
Ez win for p
Porsche for sure!!!😳
"To the Early Squad That's reading this"  Sending Virtual hugs to anyone who needs it! Stay safe everyone and positive  My dream is trying to reach 10k to make my mum and dad proud  I'll be uploading my special challenge video after I reach my goal
It's funny to see these high performance almost race cars battle against a standard run of the mill Turbo S. You should throw a GT2RS in there.
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Was the Porsche stuck in 1st gear? :D
Porsche 911 every time, Germans know the crack when it comes to making a fast vehicle. Keep up with the great work Car Wow.
Mat jumped the start in the drag
We dont care porsche  still boring
Actually there is a 911 turbo s with nice sound you just need to pay mor Money and when you buy it they can install sports exhaust and they are really nice and loud
You accidently put a video in your ad
Porsche 💪
Who cares Lambo is must for eargasm 😍😍
M Power AMG Porshe Audi Best cars in the world Germany 🇩🇪 Always top and the best car ever made 😍 only 3.6 destroy itly 😂
Porsche 911 turbo s for sure
Hi  I'd have the Porsche though.
812 all-day everyday
포르쉐 가 깡패네 ㅎㅎ
I would choose the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ without even thinking about it.
Never seen yianni warm up the tires😂
I wanna have that gray thing in the distance
Lamborghini is the best
10:31 ooh that smug face xD  I'd have the Porsche. It's the cheapest, It's the best looking on both the inside and the outside (the Aventador is ugly), and it's probably the most fun to drive. Aaaand I'd say the Ferrari sounded best. The Lambo is just.... loud.... that's all...
Ferrari all day all freakin day
Porsche ❤️
In answer to Matt Watson, and not because I have one and am biased, I would have the 911 every day. My old business partner let me drive his Lamborghini and I HATED it felt like I was in a coffin
Que máquina perfecta el Porsche!!!!!
on porsche engine ferrari looks
I love how 911 turbo S beats everything proving once again people only buy those other cars as some form of statement. One dude said to me I couldn’t “afford” a “nicer” car and had to “settle” for 911 Turbo S, which only shows that the moron thinks price is equal to performance and driving enthusiasm
6:58
Yassas the Germans.
Porsche👏👏👏💪💪👍👍
Clearly the Porsche is the fastest
The convo between these three:  Lambo & Ferrari : Woh! That porsche beat us only by a margin. Porsche : Lol! that was not even my GT2RS version. Just wait for it!😈 Ferrari : Ohk let me call SF90 Stradale! Lambo : .......I cant hear u!
Porsche 😎
You know its insane when the slowest car does 10.4 seconds
PORSCHE MY MY FAVORITE CARRR
That SVJ looks epic, sound so cool, but that Ferrari sound very good. I would go SVJ
Lamborghini..🥰
No one: Absolutely no one: Yianni: Let's talk about the bull beating the horse mate 😂😂😂😂
Definitely the Porsche and it's the cheapest.
I would take the Ferrari 812 Superfast!
German engineering  all the way 💪
Porshe  but that ferrari looks the best
Porsche is just insane
Why Ferrari always losing. Damn
a case of empty vessels make the most noise
Lambo and Ferrari... Porsche not funny to drive
I'm more of a Lamborghini guy, but for road use.......... I'd have to take the Superfast here. Hopefully whoever is giving me the car gives me the cash difference to the SVJ so I can pay for proper driving instruction, replacement tyres and insurance 🤣
This is why I love Porsche its subtle, it doesn't scream look at me I'm important. It just shows up and performs better for half the price of the Lamborghini and almost half the price of the Ferrari.
I saw I have purple svj with gold wheels today anyway the svj is by far better looking than the porche and the 812
Honestly, by far theist entertaining drag race I've seen so far... and I would totally take the Porsche any day
Trying to sound Italian, *LAMBOGHINI* ...
Porsche of course!!
Awesome, fun video. Words to the wise: never trust Lamborghini's claimed weights 🤣
I absolutely love your videos but please please please: Can you pronounce porsche in the correct way? P O R S CH E, not Porsh! Thank you for the awesome races.
i vote for porsche
3:00 we love this 🇯🇲
FERRARI ALL DAY EVERY DAYY!!!
Porsche.
porsche ganha TUDO
Yanni only has eyes on Matt  when it comes on the drag strip
Ferrari. But realistically. Just bought an AMG GLC 63. My next will be a GTr.
ZA GERMAN ENGINEERING RULES ZA VARLD(world)
Porsche engineering is top notch..
Looks: 812 Sound: SVJ Speed: 911
That's 6 less cylinders
Porsche of course. (Though I like Lamborghini's; hopefully they will build a better car next time.)
8:56  M a d   d o g  .  .  .
Would choose Turbo S all day every day
https://youtu.be/KGyE7HNk710
"superfast" with 800 hp and v12 engine can't beat usual vw beetle with l6 engine. haha
Ciao bella 😂😂 grande 👍
Yanni always cheats
Looks wise the Super Fast is amazing, shock and awe goes to the Lambo but the car I would buy would of course be the Porsche.
The pony won . . . A dog that barks loudly does not bite . . .
Silence speak louder, them Italian cars are like Dramatic Divas. Go Porsche !
Aventador svj
911 all time
6:52 the 3-2-1 lady is actually a real person!
Whatever! Who don't want that lambo though
Porsche is the Boss
If I had to drive it everyday, the Porsche.
I love Ferrari design, but that Porsche power ufff. Is making me change my mind.
Porsche 911 Turbo S all day every day
Lamborghini svj yessir
The Porsche 911 really is an overachiever that’s crazy
my favourate car is lambo, ferrari, mclaren.
Ferrari
Nobody: Absolutely nobody: Yianni: GET FROO!! GET FROO!!
Which car would I have? Obviously the technically superior car that performed better than the other two, which means I'd have to skin on the super looks of the Ferrari and the Lambo.
Yanni's Jesus Cross Tattoo is awesome
Ferrari
Can you guys get some drones to get better footage im tired of seeing inside the cars i think it would do the cars more justice seeing all of you and the cars off the line from a drone. Yeah they might now be able to keep up the whole 1/4 mile but i think it would be better for the channel too.
The Svj looks like the base Centorno from gta 5
Porsche
Out of those 3 cars Ferrari 812 any day
Lambo, all day, every day...
Porsche all day!! Every single day 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
For price and performance Porsche 100%
Is the Bugatti not the fastest car on the chanel
Porsche
911
Porsche
Lambo:I got V12 & All wheel drive +I'm light weight Ferrari: I got V12 & 800HP +I sound better Porsche: I got Flat 6 but I could beat any of you😜 BTW I'm Cheaper and more comfortable😬 Lambo&Ferrari: STFU😡
The Porsche is cheaper and faster and put together better, one is German and the others are Italian, kind of like comparing the wehrmacht  and the Italian army
The Ferrari and Lamborghini look and sound absolutely incredible
The Ferrari
Funny they're not even worried about the Porsche, they already knew they were going to lose.😄😄
812
PORSCHE
911
It was sure about Porsche! Stephen Hawking   once said: "Quiet people have the loudest minds."...Definitely PORSCHE HHHhhh
i wanna marry that 911... she is beautiful...
Porsche all the way 👍
The svj is a track car not a drag car so take them all to the Nurburgring and then test their lap times. Svj would crush all of them.
Former Porsche owner. Until you have owned both Porsche and either a Lamborghini or Ferrari, you will realize in one single drive why Italian machinery lives on.
812 superfast sounds better
Best intro ever!!!!
And the Porsche won the first run on cold tyres...
I’ll have the Porsche anytime please!💪💪👏👏🏅
I’d go for the Porsche
the Porsche is that guy you NEVER see in class, that just shows up for the exams, and that proceeds to absolutely ace them
Porsche 911 Turbo S, best car the others are for posers.
SVJ
porsche 911 turbo s?
https://youtu.be/tle5qG8kJnE
Fiat vs Audi vs VW
Porsche 911 Turbo
looks: svj perf.: por. 🐴: 🐴
911 永远滴神
SVJ sounds the best
Wanna see a Turbo S vs Veyron
Porsche by a mile!
That little Porsche is the fucking fastest car in the world
812 superfast vs 488 pista vs 458 italia
For looks. Ferrari, performance, Porsche!!!! Wow!!!
Janni cheats everytime he makes a drag race cause he starts to early
5:20 - This is why you're the hell here.
I would get a Porsche 911
911 Turbo s
That was so fn to watch))
The 911 Turbo S IS Car Goals, doesn't have the most power, isn't the prettiest, isn't the loudest, but it'll get you there a little bit quicker than the other flavors.
ferrari
Porsche is the best 🔥
Porsche kicked your asses :)
812 sf
Id go Ferrari, beautiful car
텁S ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
911 turbo S
🏁Porsche 🇩🇪
Porsche is always the best
Porsche, any day!!
U love this life matt..
Porsche
porsche is the king
you know what . tommorow will be malaysia 63th independence day . Happy Merdeka !!
PLEASE GET A 918 SPYDER VS THE 911 TURBO S
Ferrari anyday. Lamborghini's are rubbish
Can we get a dodge demon vs 911 turbos S race?
Porsche is killing it lately. All those exotic smoked by the German car. All 3 are dream cars.
Porsche, the definition of ‘Silent but deadly.’
Porsche won all four categories price speed style brake the really if you have any car you're not a loser. I'd be happy with the styling on any car The Styling on the Porsche is my least favorite. But all other cars I have which is none I would still be happy with the Porsche. It just needs a different paint job
We will crush them 💯,     and do not forget it takes true engineering to make  the engine of the  911 Turbo S whisper quite,    sound easy,  silence is not.   Bow to the one that is worthy.
Yanni seems insane in this one 🤣🤣🤣
I'D have the Porsche for sure!!! Amazing car at such price.
please drag race with bugatti chiron
Porsche for me.
812
Ferrari 100%
Porsche all day! Beautiful car
911 TURBO S , THE SILENT KING OF SUPERCARS  !
Porsche all day long.
Porsche it is the cheapest and best
That´s why you buy a german car...
What a sound by Lambo and Ferrari
Yanee only thinks of beating matt if he beats meatt he wins however losing to the porshe 😂
neither of them were even looking at or considering the Porsche the second time round lmao
Ferrari is the best looking
Im doin that aswell then!.....Hooligan. Hahah
What I have learnt From Carwow: There is only 1 car faster than a Porsche 911 Turbo S , it is a Porsche Taycan Turbo  S hahahaha , Porsche FTW at half price (I wonder what a simple remap of the 911 Turbo S would do :D )
porsche
Lamborghini and Ferrari alot of sound, but nothing more. Porsche is more discrete, elegant and of course the BETTER CAR.
I have a G60 Oettinger, the Germans are above ... ❤
Porsche
Porsche: Winning speaks louder.
best race ever and i love to have a 812 superfast 😎😄
The Porsche can do all that with the kids in the back for 100k less than the Ferrari, it’s ridiculous, I’d have the Ferrari.
i would have aventador svj though i know i can't afford anyone of these
The Porche is my pick.
Lamborghini
If that Ferrari got AWD that lambo will be blond..
Ferrari
Porsche number one
Porsche is just pure class! The 911 does not need to flash, everybody just knows its real muscles
2:03 It doesn't have dual clutch because that would make it heavier, and it's lighter because it doesn't have a dual clutch transmission.
PORSCHE❤️
Ferrari all day long ! So classy and powerful, great sound too ! If you just want row performance and not show off Porsche if you just want to show off Lambo so
Ferrari
The Ferrari was stock probably,  with a straight pipe the sound is just orgasmic, nothing beats the sound of a ferrari v12
i love lambos... i like ferraris... i guess porsches are oke.... but honestly, if i had to chose, i d actually go porsche... it s just both faster and more practical than the other two...
Now that I saw this video I think I want a Porsche
German engineering ftw
I'd have the Porsche, then the lambo....and I really don't like the Ferrari
Unser Porsche wieder am rasieren dikka, so machen wir das! 💪
German pwr
That Porche Sound Tho 💔
I'd go for the Porsche 911 Turbo, every day of the week. That reminds me, I actually did already. Had a 911 Turbo for five years, drove it every day (on studded tires during the winter). I live beyond the arctic circle. Absolute monster. I've been getting a feeling lately that after my current 991.1 C4 GTS there might be a 992 Turbo S... It's damn impressive!
Very entertaining video, as always. The only downside to all these YouTube dragrace-videos is that people forget that the ultimate test for a sports- or supercar is a track test. Cars like the Lambo SVJ is made with ultimate handling as its goal, not straight line performance.
Ferrari
ferari
Porsche is the guy in the chinos and rugby top reading his paper in the pub who when the yobs come in .... folds his paper, puts away his glasses and then kicks the shit out of 5 yobs Kingsman style.
OMG porsche 1st
Porsche are all for performance than showing off which is nice
I would take the Porsche
Porsche definitely 👏👏
Could someone tell Yianni to stop jumping the start
He jumped the start with the Lambo on the first try, obviously. Still got beat. Deservedly.  To be honest - the woman shouldn't always time the start the same. You can anticipate it so easily. Change it up. Do it quickly or delay it so they actually have to react. I'm surprised I haven't seen a comment about this in any videos so far.
Svj
Lamborghini still is the sexiest of the 3😍
Ferrari
Thats a first time i seen a Porsche drive that fast
Porsche has more than 100 horses less but its quick, man, but unfortunately it looks like a frog 🐸. I'll take the SVJ out of these 3 cars.
Always Porsche the best car
We can say Porsche 911 the beast 😎👍 نستطيع القول بأن بورش 911 الأفضل😎👍
Your italian pronuciation is so embarassing🤮
Porsche looks the best imo i love porsches
Porsch looks the best
I'd buy the Porsche if I could 😃
12:02 812 supafast
That lambo rear wing is a failure. Porsche youre awesome.
PORSCHE THE BEST 💪👌👍
The Porsche sounds better 😑
Porsche, it is best
That Ferrari in black 🔥
Svj sounds better
I'll take the Porsche all day
5:04 is that a Civic
Всегда нравился порше!
I will put my money on Porsche
Best intro
I love Lamborghini SVJ
Ferrari 812 is my dream car
Porsche selvfølgelig
Think about a four wheel drive ferrari lambo would be nowhere...
Please stop calling it “porsh”! Please pronounce it as “por-shuh”!
I would surely have the prancing horse. Not even a doubt in my mind. But would have a porsche 911 gts naturally aspirated for the weekends, and still spend less than the cost of that audi in Italian dressing.
lambo all day every day😏
FERRARI TOTALLY SMASHED THE LIGHTER MORE ACCURATE VERSION OF THE BEST LAMBO THEY HAVE FUCKING TURD MACHINE SVJ
Definitely the 812
Either lambo or 911, i guess definitely 911 because i spend less, get better performance, about sound then i guess with few 1000 bucks i can get better silencer than ferrrari or lambo😎. Ferrari and lambo just proved in ur vid that they are waste of money in front of that 911
The ferrari sounds better
That Ferrari looks sweet.
Lamba
Daumen runter für so viel Werbung
Lamborghini
Ferrari
Turbo s......
911 !!
I have la farrari
The Porsche!!
I would take the 911. Lambos and Rarris are for people who like to show off but when they are actually challenged they fail against the better more humble but still more beautiful car.
Porsche distroye everything 😂😂
People wastes money on Lamborghini Aventador SVJ and Ferrari 812 Super fast when Porsche strikes back it is cheaper than the competitors but faster  Porsche: I am getting fuel  Lamborghini: Ferrari I will win Ferrari: No Lamborghini I will win *drag race starts* Porsche: See you suckers
Mat: tell me about the lambo. Yianni: The hat... the name... the sticker... the friend.
The ridiculous number of ads is making great YouTube vids like this unwatchable. Can’t even skip most of them any more and there are two when we used to get just one.  Another tech giant making itself obsolete because of massive corporate greed. Their funeral.
Fiat Panda!
Ferari
SVJ
SVJ
SVJ
No way that Porsche is 650 hp. Cheaters 😹
Do a 991.2 turbo a vs a 992 turbo s
Ferrari
This is the wrong type of drag race I was looking for
I choose 911 every day all day  To be honest . I am disappointed with SVJ because he has the best time at the nurburgring, he has the best power / weight ratio he is the most expensive and then he was beaten by a beetle in every test. The 911, on the other hand, has the least hp, the worst power / weight and is 200k cheaper than the Lamborghini and 100k cheaper then ferrari and it also have 4 seats like ferrari.
8:55 disappointed Yani 😂😂
SVJ
Is anyone gonna talk about the Aero on the Lambo slowing it down in terms of top speed?
Porsche any day!
Are you mad? Im going lambo 100%
All that money and cheaper Porsche kills it
Ohh and BTW " CARWOV
Ferrari 812 superfast
Wow
I want that porsche
Et encore l'autre tarbouif part 1 seconde avant sa lambo
When you do the rolling test form 50mph let’s give an external signal to you guys that would be more fair for the other two cars
Porsche
So the cheapest quietest car wins, lol...
Lamboooooo🔥❤️
It's simple !!! All we nead to see is ............ PORSCHE 911 TURBO to win !!! ..... and like METALLICA says: " And nothing els mathers !"
SVJ 💗
Lamborghini aventador svj is way better
The fat guy jumped the start in the first race making the Porsche win even clearer
German cars are most reliable than other cars
When are you going to get a Rimac concept one or concept two @Mat Watson ?
While Italians 🇮🇹 get fighting Germany’s 🇩🇪 get the benefit.  That’s what policy Means guys let them tear down each other and get the benefit while their attention is off.🤣🤣🤣🤣
9 year old jdm fanboy: *a sUPrA wOuLD sMOke tHeM aLL*
Porsche is the BEST
Thanks Mat now I know I must buy as fan car Porsche, no Ferrari, no Lamborghini, no M8 BMW
My heart= Ferrari. My brain = Porsche.  Lambo....naahh
Porsche all day every day.
Lamborghini Sound and Look is best
Porche all day long, even though is not the best looking out there is the king 👑
812
Porsche would be mine as its more subtle
Definitely Porsche 911 turbo s
PORSCHE 🔥🐎
A BMW perhaps.! ;)
This video needs more ads.
I’d take the Ferrari... realistic performance on the roads and looks so nice for all occasions
Ferrari 812
Porsche all the way for me. The f12 and the svj are amazing cars but the 911 is the all round best car in the world rite now. Plus you can drive it over the road humps without pulling faces going over them 😬😵😣😩
Porsche
812 is the best sounding car here.
I am German, so I’d definitely have to Turbo S! It’s the fastest and the best looking.
F12. Easy.
Money no object, Definitely the Lambo. Statement.
Why don't you use porsche to bet yami's car and his attitude
Can we get a pagani? Ever in a race? Thanks
Absolutely 100% i will take the Porsche 911 Turbo S
1. That was awesome. 2. That Poresche is a f**king missile!
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ 😌💯🔥
Yamini is so selfish for lambo 😂 porsche won it all goes to that car
Ferrari
I'd have the Ferrari in a heart beat
No one will say this but that 300k+ Lamborghini is taking is just for looks then?, freaking Porsche proved that here + same with Ferrari. 🙄
Yianni is hilarious
In a world full of Lambos and Ferraris, be a Porche. :)
Everyone seems to talk about the Turbo S' performance in drag races & 1st rolling race. It sure is a 'performante' and we know Porsche always makes kings of drag race. But no one talks about the 812 Superfast having the lowest torque and the heaviest but smoke the others in 2nd rolling start in sportiest settings.
o mais barato venceu o seja a posche kkkkk
3:15
812 baby
Lambo
It's faire that you won the second since yanni cheated in the first one
Hi Mat, I would like to know what car you drive and if possible review it on this channel.
It would be the Ferrari 812
If only there was a 720s in that race as well
I never, ever thought I would call a Porsche 'good value'. But there seems to be nothing else that comes anywhere close for the money.
To be honest I wouldn't have none of them because I'm not stupid enough to give $100,000 or more for the car
That Porsche sounds beautiful
I would go SVJ all the way......but  that Porsche!!!
Porsche eben ☺️
THE SVJ HAS THE BEST SOUND
9 9 2  turbo  s
Bro you are crazy 😂...I watch the videos just for your banter with yianni and your funny stunts... I’m a fan 😎
is that Porsche street legal?
If the Porsche is the king how about the Porsche and the Ferrari LaFerrari????? Interesting
911 turbos S the king !!!!
What would happen if porsche made a turbo S with a V12 😂🚀🚀🚀
Measuring balls. Jest get the car you like the most. The chance you get to race another super car on street is very slim to none. Even if you did you can't do these kind of speeds and not ending in jail. Lol. Just get the one you Iove.
The Aventador SVJ❤️
Porche 🔥🔥🔥
porche❤️
Came here for the Porsche and got the expected results ;)
Lambo all day every day
I did not expect that porsche..
Ciao bella ❤️
These are real cars, not shitty electrics
911 😍all year performance
Porsche but the Ferrari Sound the best
Porsche is so better and  most important is its pocket friendly .
Imagine scrolling down then you find this comment                May God bless you
Fat hilly billy in a Lambo, so appropriate
Porsche
My only dream is to make my momma proud
The acceleration of the Ferrari is really good from a stand still, being the only one with rear wheel drive, and once rolling the acceleration is mind blowing. For looks and sound i would also choose the Ferrari.
Porsche all the way baby!!!
Race starts 5:22
I d like the 812 sooo badly
Porsche everyday.....
Fuckin hell the Ferrari shifts at 8500 rpm that's mad! 😳
Ferrari 800hp, lambo 770hp, Porsche 650.... 🤔 Please re-do this with GT2!? Otherwise it is not fair 🤪 because we want to win the rolling Race as well
Порш в 2 раза дешевле и быстрее. Сила👍
Man that German technology  wow porsche
And again PORSCHE 👍the best
Ferrari is like in F1... cant beat the germans...
1:11 What is the name of the brand of the sweater he's wearing?❓❓❓❓❓
Brummian and Gerbrumm
Superfast all day
German engieering...beat the bull that jumped the gun the dickhead
😂😂 The front number plate for the Ferrari looks like its about to fall down!
Ok but how did the porsche actually win
All day everyday Porsche 911 turbo S, then the Ferrari, then the Porsche.
812 superfast
VW vs Fiat
German ftw
No question it’s the Porsche! If you want to drive a car and enjoy owning it . Reliable German Engineering.
porche
PORSCHE SOUNDS THE BADDER, BUT IS THE FASTEST.
The 812 sounded the best
Me: Porsche!! Mat: Really?! Me: Did I stutter!
5:20 to skip all the BS
Damn the start of the video was really *RACIST*
The Porsche!!👍
Amazing Porsche.
SVJ
Potsche !!!! ❤️
Guys the ferrari 812 is faster then the lamborghini... it doesn't have AWD.. It had a poor start.. Matthew should have had a rolling RACE to give the ferrari a chance.. And this ferrari is Not LIMITED... The SVJ Is.. Ferrari needs to comes out with a 812 limited.. I'll pick the ferrari any day.. Great video guys
while ferrari and lambo are waving hands arguing which one is faster, porsche wins  ok except rolling race too much raw power on those V12s
The competitivene mean face Yani makes during the races thou 😂😂😂😂😬
I choose Porsche any day
Ferrari 812 Superfast!!!!
Porsche sound is awsome
Porsche all day everyday
812 💪🏻
Lamborghini svj 💪
Porsche power 💪
Poooorscheee
Porche the german is the best
Lambo any day
I think lambo is messing with numbers.
German engineering..
The PORSCHE IS LIFE!!! That's more than value for money
Ferarri: vroooom vrooom Lambo: brrowwwm broowwmmm Porsche: ssssshhhhh *while sipping beer and eating bratwurst*
It’s is the Matta Watson from Ze carwow 🤣
Ferrari super fast
You can get 2 Porsches for that Lamborghini and still save  48.000 pounds which is mind blowing!
Porsche 911 TurboS😍
@matt can we get a turbo s vs a 918 video?
svj
I will take the Porsche anyday!
what about a porsche gt2 against a turbo s , svj and the superfast ;)
Porsche is the quiet boy in the class🤣
The SVJ wins the looks for me But the Porsche is just so cool
All 3 cars are mind blowing, love every cumbustion car that beats electric cars, if only that Ferrari had 4 wheel drive
Porsche all the way! 😁
Only one Porsche
Porsche 😍
คนขับsvj มึงกระจอกเกินว่ะ
in germany we call the Porsche" Deutsche Ingenieurskunst"
Lambo's definitely louder, but ferrari still sounds way better
포르쉐 진짜 멋짐
PORSCHE 💯🔥
992 Turbo S
I'm from Italy, viva la figa
Yianni definitely cheated the start
Man. 812 is so magnificent. I'd take this one every day
Porsche! 10/10 times!
The Porsche is the cheapest car there well played Porsche
Lambo and ferrari trying to beat each other  Btw porsche 7:29
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ is the better car
Ultimate rolling race would be: 720s vs 812 superfast vs porsche taycan.
He's putting his life at risk so subscribe 😂😂😂
Matt do a race with the Porsche 918 vs the LaFerrari vs the Mclaren P1
911 turbo S  S=Sleeper
I love Yanni and Mat just as much as these awsome cars!  They contribute to half the smiles in these races... But boy, Porche punches above its class. So impressive!
The 812 Superfast is very fast considering it's RWD. The 911 Turbo S is extremely fast and a better GT than the 812. I'd pick the 812 as a weekend car over a 911. The engine alone is worth the massive price tag. The Aventador is not my cup of tea.
SVJ
Bloody hell, fair play to the porsche...
I’d have the Turbo S 100%
Ferrari sounds best 👍🏼
Porsche 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ the perfection of engineering
Dear Santa,    Porsche 911 Turbo S.
Would definitely pick the Porsche. It’s beautiful but not in a „LOOK AT ME GIVE ME ATTENTION“ way. It’s a car for track days and daily. For the gentlemen.
If I could have one of those three cars, I would own a Ferrari 812 Super Fast.
Ferrari 🤩
I would have the Ferrari
812 superfast
Lamborghini svj
Never can't get get enough of Yianni look when he's driving. 😂
I love how it’s a race between the lambbo and ferrari but the porche is pushed aside
Ferrari sounds like a f1 car, lamborghini like a superbike and porsche like a......honda accord.
Look how bad the Lamborghini clutch is. Yianni moves all over the place when it changes gear
So if you want the fastest car buy the one with the least power
I whould get the Porsche, but with a different and bright colour. A sport car must look like a sport car, not a gentelman car :)
Please race the SVJ against the 720S cuz the Porsche 911 Turbo S won against the Mclaren and the SVJ did so well against the Porsche...gonna be close if Carwow brings this race to life
Porsche 911 Turbo S, because you never know when you'll get two overly enthusiastic supercar drivers insulting your car only to watch them disappear being you in a drag race 😁
Porsche
Yani clearly does not know, that Pandas are fast af when rolling... You know... in rolling race :DDD
Porsche 911 😁🖤
That lambo is garbage
911 turbo s after the GTR im in love with that beast
5:21 saved 5 minutes of your life
Lmao these fools kill me
LAMBO JOTA
That’s Why It’s Called Germany
Ferrari
WHY DONT FERRARI MAKE A FERRARI 812 SUPERFAST FXX EDO FOR THE ROAD
Looks: Ferrari Sound: Lamborghini Performance: Porsche Price: Porsche  I would take the Porsche because I live in Germany. If u have an expensive exotic car which is that loud here in Germany everyone hates u. I would always be scared that someone damages the car on purpose. Fuck Germany - full of persons which hates expensive cars because they cant buy one themselfe..

порш ,браво малыш!!!
Yanni is getting funnier each video!
I would absolutely choose the Porsche that's fine German engineering
Your accents were on point
2 x VW vs. 1 x Chrysler.
I would take the Porsche all day :D
Off course the Porsche
PORSCHE ALL THE WAY ❤️
Yani knows the Porsche is the best looking too 😂
These launches are ridiculous. Porsche and Lambo both had an early start 1st and 3rd runs. Not a Ferrari fan per say but come on.
812 sounds better
812
Money no object. Porsche. Lamborghini is possibly the least attractive vehicle on the road
Can you please do the french accent for the next time
Lambo sound 4 life
Race @ 5:20
The best is lumbo
5:22 You're welcome! Note: Ferrari being slow in everything lately!
id get a porsche not an svj
Lamborghini and Ferrari: IM BETTER IM BETTER Porsche: —  But... Porsche: Wins silently Lamborghini and Ferrari: AAAAAAARRRRRRR
911 Tirbo S!
100% the Porsche
Moral of the story. Know how you spend your money!
911 over both 812 and SVJ
812
Porsche said: Less talking and more doing😂
The best looking car is the ferrari Lambullshiti thinks they look good by adding lines and triangles
The lambo and the Porsche jumped the line on the first drag race.
lmao Yanni is funny ASF. I started dying when he was was doing the drifts.   But honestly tho. That porsche is stewpidd!
812
11:03 do it for the YouTube money looool got me
I would have the svj
porsche is done after 190mph
I think they use Porsche as a camera car :D
The Porsche really is like the quiet kid in school
I would choose the SVJ hahah
I don't like Yanni's drag races, he always making false start and running first before this girl said go...
Yanny : "lets talk about the bull beating the horse"  The porsche also being a horse : am i a joke to you
812 all day
Can we all agree on thing?? If the Aventador had the DCT from the Huracan(Obv beefed up to handle the power),it would win?Leave ur thoughts cause the biggest bottleneck for the Aventador is it's 7 speed single clutch gearbox 😐
I would have the Ferrari best looking and sound I think
Yanni false start, cheater
PORSCHE!!!
That Porsche is like that quiet kid in class that gets all A's
Aventador SVJ
F12
Solve the equation (L + F) x (?)=P hint p~ too big of a number.  Another hint don’t even sweat about it.
Those supercars sound like a good old V8 Merc which got its nuts kicked out
The 812 superfast is just one great looking coupe. Proportions are just right and it looks fast just staying still
Porsche all day
Porsche
Do a drag race between ferrari 812 superfast and mclaren 720s
Porsche sounded the best hands down
PORSCHE every time!!!
ferrari
The 911 is easily the best looking car! Don’t know what the heck Yianni was talking about! Porsche all day every day
I absolutely love Mats German and Italian Accents 😂
3.8 litres, 6 cylinders won the race! All should learn from GERMAN ENGINEERING.
Halfway through the video and ive seen 4 advertisements already
At high speed the svj gets more airdrag otherwise it should be faster. But probably it gets a bit of downforce through corners to make laptimes faster. It’s about 3 sec faster than the 911 on an average racetrack
Ferrari
Porsche 911 turbo S is the best at all the time, well done Mr. Porsche engineer
Porsche: I dont make sound, i show you all what SPEED is
Hahaha the German accent got me bad!
Porsche with less power.... just a awesome car!
Porsche 911 Turbo S, the best of them all 💯 i would buy that.!! Dont need no massive wings etc just gets the job done, and its a daily too
I would go for the Porsche out of these three cars for sure!
Ferrari
The 911
The Porsche is another class
FERRARI 812 SUPERFAST all day
5:03 I wonder if Yanni talked to his friend before doing that 😳
ferrarri
Porsche all day 💯💯
Porsche all day long 👍
Lamborghini all the way
As Usual, Ferrari and Lamborghini useless against the Turbo !
The sound of the Porsche is best. Winning sounds great to me.
Svj🔥
Itali GTA vs Zentorno vs Comet custom
Ferrari is the best good looking for me. But I will take the Porsche
Ferrari 812 superfast is One of best Cars I know and also One of the best looking Cars.
Porsche 👌
I’d have the Porsche , love that thing , the Italian cars are too in your face, the gearbox in the lambo looks brutal like it was made for a horse and cart 🤣 and the Ferrari is only good at illegal speeds , the Porsche for and everyday car and track car , it’s got the right balance
Tiny correction: Porsche 640 HP = 650 PS
Replace the 812 Superfast with the F8 Tributo and he will destroy the porsche.
Porsche!
That lambo is the car equivalent to that one way too loud friend, who shows up already wasted to every party and then proceeds to take over every conversation with d*ck jokes while knocking people's drinks over.  What an embarrassing car... I wouldn't be caught dead in a lambo with freaking stickers all over it.
Too many adverts, too much Yani, he's a man child
Such beautiful cars! It’s like a visual orgasm.
911 all day, everyday.
Porsche 911 would be definitely the choice if it just wouldnt sound like a f*** vacuum cleaner....
Now do it with a 720 s
Money no option Ferrari My own money the Porsche
Always the Porsche
I really don't care about the speed of the Porsche. If I had the chance to spend 150k on a car, it'd better look different from my Dentist's.
That Porsche is so quick that Lamborghini is very special and I’m not a Ferrari man and is no way near the top of my list but ....... big but the Ferrari just looks pure evil 😈 it’s gorgeous I don’t know whether I’m being biased just because I have an Alfa Romeo but Dayam girl you thick 😂
https://youtu.be/qD3nvcwEooc
Lambo SVJ all day 💪
Always lambo #lambofanboys
cheapest fastest most reliable  best performing  porsche truly makes incredible cars
Yianni: he’s never let anyone drive his car,  Also Yianni: 5:02
Man, I m Italian and that accent literally killed me!! It a been one of the funniest and unexpected thing I ve ever heard! Absolutely awesome😂😂😂
Love the Porsche: it quietly decemates these jukebox machine... 😂
German Engineering...🤷‍♂️👍
#Ferrari812superfast
I’d have to take the 812 Super Fast, that thing is just gorgeous
Svj is the best looking no question
I'll have the Porsche any day... Every day
"it's not your business" Porsche said
Def Ferrari in red
That turbo S just brilliant
Mat and yianni are the best couple of youtube
🤣 Yianni is absolutely hilarious with his competitiveness!  I’d still take the super fast, it just looks the bomb!
I would take the most expensive SVJ, sell it... buy a 911 and lots of cash on hand!
Svj
That Porsche tho
Sorry to sound like a stupid person to some people but I will take the lambo because aventador was my childhood car
I live in Zuffenhausen... And work for Porsche AG. Best working place in the world. They make the best Cars ever!!!
not gonna lie, Id by the Ferrari for the looks
I’ve never been a Porsche fan... but that 911 rules everything
Porsche is soooooo much better than either.  Goooo volkswagon!
Porsche 👌
All of them
I would buy The Ferrari and Porsche as well!
Whatever they do at Porsche—FIA should investigate.
Another one with Yanni! I need more of these collabs!
That's the meaning of Porsche❤
Porsche
i see yianni i hit like
Stunning accents 😆
Lamborgini way better than both of em (I'm a lamborgini fan I love lambos)
That was really good hahaha
Off course i could have the Porsche.
The Porsche is absolut amazing!!!!
ferrari for sure
https://youtu.be/5wUSMapbDrs YT
I don’t think the Porsche is getting good start cause if I am not wrong it can beat electric cars during launch and has beaten the 720s, Taycan and a Tesla on this channel. Surprised how close the Lambo gets during launch. I mean I don’t know if that Lambo is really that good or if the Porsche is not being launched properly.
Viva italia
My fav ❤️ Porsche 911 turbo S
Imagine the porsche having the same power as the other 2 it would be next level already quickest car there 😳
everybody gangsta til the porsche shows up
Ferrari  Porsche then lambo
That Porsche is stupid fast
Always loved the Porsche. More subtle but it's just marvelous.
Still go the ferrari or lambo for the fun factor and those sounds!
What a cheating scum bag jumped the line. His an arrogant moron this Yanni.
Porsche without a doubt. Looks the best and performs the best. Will be the most reliable too.
Ferrari for a daily
Btw anyone with car knowledge would know that it’s the 4wd setup that gives the Porsche a massive advantage. To be far it’s also the reason why the Lamborghini is demolishing the Ferrari and isn’t massively behind the Porsche. Still think the reader driver McLaren 675LT can catch and pass the Porsche before the finish line.
Why do some of the new cars have soft limiters and some don't? I thought that they are mandatory now in EU?
The 911 is such a master. Nearly always there’s a plonker in Ferrari and always always there’s one in Lamborghini.
I want the Ferrari 812 superfast
I would honestly get that Ferrari in midnight blue, that looks so beautiful.
911 turbo S ♥️♥️♥️
I would have the Ferrari
Look at this porsche woaaw. Thats german engineering
Porsche
That SVJ had the best exhaust 🔊 911 I respect you with Lambo Rarri nd Mclaren
Definately the ferrari!🤩🤩
Porsche every day of the week. Best value for money bets if the line and outstanding brakes.
Once again, Porsche defying all odds. What an insane car.
Svj
Porsche is made better and faster but the Aventador SVJ is the best looking car by far.
Your missing a car that should wipe the floor with the Porsche, even with RWD let alone the Ferrari and Lamborghini? The McLaren 765LT
911 turbo s is a silent assassin
Lamborghini svj
Porsche is the best looking😍
Lamborghini SVJ
Horse vs Bull vs Horse xD
Anytime anyday Lamborghini Aventador SVJ🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fararri sounded best
I would have the porsche
the porsche will destroy them on a track
I would have 911. It,s awesome
Lambo SVJ all day every day 😂
Svj
i would definetly buy the porsche but put a aftermarket exhaust system with no mufflers
Porsche is  a beast ha a v6 car winning two v12 cars . It's not about the power and cylinder bro it's about weight.
Car Wow probably have higher income from YT than commissions on new car sales now.
Porsche all day long
German technology Porsche all day
Aventador all day eryday baby
Ferrari 812 all the way!
Porsche!
Porsche!!!
Ferrari won the sound test.
AccentWOW that was funny!!!! hahahahah
Aventador design with 911's drag race performance and 812 Super fast rolling race performance would be the sweet spot.
Ferrari won the sound test.
PORSCHE 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
the 812 was designed for the top end of performance no 4WD that it why it easily smokes the SVJ and the Turbo S I would have the 812 and take it to novitec for the wide body kit and suspension and exauht tune.
Ferrari
Yianni is a cheat
If he had thought the Porsche would win.......his big headed self would have driven it. The only auto channel I watch with the volume muted.
Porsche is the best always everywhere!
Matt, do a duels of the v12! Ferrari 812 vs Lamborghini Aventador SVJ vs Aston Martin DBS Superleggera (and any other currently produced v12 cars besides those 3)
I AM truly so in love with the porsche😍
Haha Porsche is best 👍😃
Why intro one driver and not the other? Porsche still 🤴...
So nobody gonna mention that the Porsche and the Lamborghini jumped the go. The Ferrari left on the dot. Not a fair race.
Porsche
There's only 1 good sports car : PORSCHE. Reliable, fast, quiet. Ferrari : always broken  Lambo : Always broken
Porsche: Manners... Maketh... Man. Lambo: ... Ferrari: ... Porsche: Do you know what that means? Lambo: ??? Ferrari: ??? Porsche: Then let me teach you a lesson.
Lambo all day bruv.
812 🔥🚘💪🏻
The turbo s is ridiculously fast
the labo all the way
Porsche
I'd take the SVJ, sell it and buy 3 turbo S's.
Sorry but Yianni jumps most starts in all the videos! Haha
Porsche all the way.....100%
Understated Porsche every day.
Ferrari,breaks down at 400 meters 🤣🤣 Italian engineers 😂😂
ポルシェがどれだけコスパいいかわかるね
Porsche is not a Supercar. Only the 918 and GT2RS are supercars.
Porsche will always be the best car brand in the world, those guys make magical cars
That 911 is a special special car.
Porsche is like "Bruce Lee in Suit" baby face but definitely BRUTAL
The Lambo will demolish all these cars on track and challenging roads (twisties).. Lambo ALA Aero system is a serious piece of kit 💯
That Lambo looks like a spaceship next to the Ferrari and the Porsche lol
A blue Porsche
The Porsche is funny coz it beat them both.
The porches turbo s
So funny they only care about how to beat each other, whilst the Porsche is smashing both of them for good 😂😂😂
I don't think when there is a Lamborghini, there's Yianni. Coz Mat cheated last time with Yianni in that Aventador vs Audi drag race.
Always 812 SF
Ferari
Mat face when the Lambo reves 😅😅😅😅
Ferrari 812 superfast
Svj
Is it only me or the guy in lambo looks like Abhishek Bachchan 😂
We would like to see the GT2 RS against any car
I would take the Ferrari over the Lamborghini.
Porsche sounds the best and goes the best 👍🏼👌🏼💪🏼
6:05, porsche is also a horse
992 Turbo S. I can get a louder exhaust, no big deal.
I think the Lambo looks the best, the Porsche is a nutter in a reserved sort of way and as a lifetime Ferrari fan though, I was a little unimpressed
Svj
I liked the accents
i want the ferriera to win
Money no object, Ferrari. Current funds . . .Porsche
lambo
Porshe far the better car
5:20 for the race. Just fing race them and skip the 5 minute intro for fucks sake
It's remarkable how efficient the 911 Turbo S is. It just gets the job done without all the drama and fuss that these Italian cars have :)
12:05 Liturally every seven year old: laMBo
Absolutely 911 turbo s
Definitely the Porsche for me, even if money is no object.
You and Yanni make the best video duo
Porsche my fav car ever at that price destroys anything bar none!
Matt i love you Italian accent :-)
Porsche
I'll have the 911 all day long .  Plus less expensive , more balanced,  more durable. Etc..Lambo driver got a jump at the start. Not saying he cheated...but he did...
Porsche !!
Ferrari 🐎❤️
Out of those three, I'd have a Ferrari GTC4
Ferrari!
812 superfast I would have this
So for half the money you can be faster? Nice!
If I was given one to choose, or if money wasn't an object... I'd choose the 812 Super Fast
Nice Video and nice Drag Race 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Porsche my Favorit 😎
Porsche
SVJ 🤙🏻
"Enough with the plugs", plays an ad straight after lmfao
From 7:17 till the finish line yianni was having a series of minor strokes.
*5:20** Thank me later...*
Thé Porsche: Top engineering!
The 812 all the way,best car there
Ferrari every day
These videos are the reason Porche sales are up. They should say thank you and give carwow an RS Porche to drag....
The 911 would get my cash
Lamborghini
I would like to have 911 turbo S in my garage...it’s so good 😊
Porsche
Would take the turbo s every day of the year. It's a better daily
How tf did the porsche beat them lol
12:00 Can’t decide between 812 and Turbo S..
Ferrari. :  I think I have loudest sound.  Lamborghini. :  I am gonna explode your speakers.😂😂😂😂😂😂
Carwow making the most entertaining content on YouTube rn
I think the 812 is one of the most beautiful cars I know, especially the Mansory 'Stallone' tuned version of it...
Porsche, then Ferrari
I love how Matt and Janny always try to beat each other and they forgot about that porsche bc it is so freaking fast
The cheapest of the lot and still smashing the giants. Porsche rules!!!
Porches all the way
Ferrari 812
Lamborghini SVJ only
Porsche : I kill supercars without any sound 😂🔥
All hail the king 👑 (Porsche)
The Ferrari looks the best by far
Next drag race Mclaren 720 vs porsche gt2rs
i would definetly  go for the lambo because it almost caught up with the porsche  and its looks miles better and sounds superb
Farrarri
I mean - come on! Yanni likes to ignore that 911... But it absolutely smashed them and is many, many thousands cheaper??? Incredible car!
8:56 yanny's face
Porsches are the ultimate driver’s car. Plus they are cheaper.
Matt I'll be having Porsche 911 Turbo S it's a beast
Porsche its just amazing what its capable of
Yianni jumped it the first time around
Everyone loves a sleeper
I cant believe how crappy this Lambo's transmission is... its like Yianni has a hickup each time it shifts gears
*Ever heard about GT2 RS??*
Turbo S is mad quick 💯
I lost my job and then making an Instagram Tool for everyone who wants to Auto Liker or Auto Unliker on Instagram and many other features.
lambo would destroy them on track
wow for once yanni lost in every test, almost felt bad for him lol just almost.
Porsche is sexy af
I’ll take the svj regardless of price. Looks the best, sounds the best, best brand, and they’re all close enough to the same quickness to where it doesn’t matter
Review or a drag race on a dodge hellcat ?
Die Porsche 911 Turbo S ist sehr schnell, das ist weil es habe ein 3,8 Liter Motor und ein Turbo. Für ein Porsche ist das sehr normal (ein Turbo)!  I didn't use google translate for this! I got German lessons at my school, that's why I know this...  Edit: I would buy the Porsche 911 Turbo S
The Porsche is so effective at what it does it doesn't even waste any power to make a great sound.
Mat, in the future, I advise you to consider the weight of the pilot.
Porsche all day long and I'm not a big fan. Give me a BMW, but of those three, Porsche is class.
Thst svj is litt
911
812 man...got to have that engine
911 Turbo S !
I'll subscribe if you do accents of cars in the next video as well.
Porsche
Check us out 🎥
Insane porsche, a beast! The best car for drag race.
Porshe 911 turbo s ТОП!!!
Lambo 🤩
Would u buy a sheep or a lambo? Hha
Porsche all day always!
YANNI STOP jumping starts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Ohhh the Porsche! I've killed the Ferrari though!"  Positive thinking...:)
"LESS IS MORE", proved again by PORSCHE.
I don’t even have to watch the video and can tell you the Porsche will destroy anything that is put against it.
Porsche is not only the best car but it looks better than those overdone italians.
Porsche is king
Yanni, the unbeaten King of false starts... 😂😂😂 Still lost.
Enough of these shenanigans!  Porsche 911 GT2RS vs 911 Turbo S!  🔥🔥🔥
Superfast
Can anyone hear the Porsche sound?!
Ferari : looks  Lambo : sound  Prosche : performance
Ferrari bc it looks the best
The amazing thing is that's not even the top of the 911 performance line....
Italian’ish’ English
Half the cylinders and it performs like that. Damn Porsche you be doing some crazy engineering
Looks and sound Lambo Overall Porka by a long shot
In this test, I'm taking the Porsche. Probably be a bit better on cost of ownership
The fvj
It makes me forgot that porche is straight 6.. Holy sh*t..
Porsche has been doing this for the past decade. Guarantee a turbo s from from 2011 could still smoke both the Ferrari and the SVJ.
I'd have the Lambo, no questions, it's the full package. If I wanted a fast car, the Porsche. If I wanted a posers car, the Ferrari.
NSX would smoke'em all...I think
Porsche is twice the car those two monstrosities are , with half the cylinders. 911 all day
Porsche sounded better for sure. No obnoxious and unnecessary noise
I would like to have Porsche 911
You look young again, that haircut was necessary
Love the videos! Thanks carwow! I would definitely choose the Ferrari for the better looking car but Porsche is also the better car for the track I thin!
The fact that the Turbo S only lost 1 roll race the whole video is insane. I don’t know how Porsche does it with these Turbo S. They improve on whats already perfect!
SVJ HANDSDOWN
Yanni is talking Bull!  😂.  I guess Lambos are sort of ok IF you're going Tractorpulling.... Ferrari will always be the better choice. Looks - performance - pedigree ❤️😎
5:21 7:01
Porsche 😍
Turbo s VS GT 3 RS
Definitely the Ferrari
Man I've been waiting for a SVJ race.
Lamborghini win over the sound, love the Ferrari but will take the Lamborghini any day ha ha.... It looks awesome
Nice work
why u driving it in auto smh
Id choose the Lamborghini tho the Porsche is better in the straight line than both.. the Lamborghini was beaten because of downforce.
SVJ 🔥
Porsche is sweeping away with half the cylinder and just under 400 hp , is there something wrong with the lambo 770hp & farrari 800hp
i'll take all 3 of them...
German powa ❤
We all know that mat hate Lamborghini but truly it's still perfect single clutch car this days , just love it AVENTADOR ❣️
Ferrari best looking. Best car Porsche
911 for sure
Imagine if Porsche actually tried making a really fast car...
Felt like the Porsche was having a race on its own.
Porshe. More cheaper, more faster.
Yiani jumped!
Porsche!
So it’s official, Porsche is still my dream brand 😁
His accent makes this soo much better 😆
Porche
Porsche 911 turbo S
svjvs mclaren 720s
I live for the rear end of the turbo s
Kids will pick the Lambo and Ferrari, men will pick Porsche/VW
Lamborghini is 2nd in every race
Lol Porsche must be 750hp, can’t be 650hp.
Hope I will se Ford GT somewhen
The lambo
Turbo S sounds the best
Porsche FTW!
Ferrari looks the best by far
ok i wanted an italian exotic i think i'll settle for a porsche now
Porsche all day
Wow that Porsche 911 Turbo S is out of this world 😯
Sir, could u do a drag race with a buggati
I take the lambo
I’d take the Porsche.
Porsche by far. It's quicker and brakes better.   Porsche accept no substitute!
200% would take the 911 <3
I would have the lambo
Always fun to have a Yannie versus Matt... Best drag races, and more importantly, amazing camaraderie 👏🏼👍🏼
Svj by farrrrr
Ferrari sounds the best.  Lamb was just harsh.
An empty vessel makes the most noise😂😂😂
I love that super fast
911 for me please.
Lolol "the gray thing" I love the way all ferreri look but 2 V12 against a flat 6 ....the Germans whipped dat ass
wow, could not believe my eyes! The Turbo S is the car to have!!!!! it was basically "I got V12 800 horse and F1 heritage!" "I ve got V12 730 horses and Nurburgring record!                   "Fuck you ja"
We all know what the Porsche is about..... need something special to beat the Porscha
Why does nobody ever bring up the fact that Yianni so obviously jumped the start? Matt's always accused of jumping when it's later proved he didn't but when Yianni clearly jumps very badly nobody notices? U don't even need a high speed camera to see how badly he cheated. U can clearly see he jumps off the line before she even starts bringing her hands down.
The porche is sound awesome
Porsche = low profile, quiet self confidence, guy who goes unnoticed until it's time to throw down and then smashes the false bravado, overly loud, insecure blowhard.
Yiani jumped the line the first race
I'd have that Porsche, what a fantastic piece of engineering, that Lambo's sound though!?
I own a 911  I love it!
Love from india In kooks Ferrari  In sound lombo In speed in s.mode porsche
SVJ
Hilarious that Yanni only cares about beating Matt, even if it comes at the cost of losing to someone else!
SVJ sounded the best
Lamborghini SVJ
Now imagine the outcome if we included a GTR R35 Nismo.....
I think the porsche just camera car that giving you an angle in front of the lambo and ferrari
911
S V J!
Porsche
100% i go with porsche
SVJ
This was the best intro in all Carwow videos
Porsche all day every single day! That German engineering is something else. Got to love it!
I would pick Porsche, better engineering, safety, more elegant, FASTER. Better all around
Porsche turbo for me. It’s the most reliable. It can do launch control all day long I bet those two Italians can’t.
In real life.  If only 3 of these to choose from then Porsche 911 turbo S (can't pass up the best performance and best price)   For just looks and lux feels Ferrari.   But this is all pre Tesla roadster 2.0.   For the price of Porsche 911 S....but ultimate hypercar.
Porsche is all show and every time it is ready to slay other beasts.. Will definitely buy porsche
Lambo and Ferrari are racing each other, meanwhile, the Porsche is waiting at the finish line to see if they want to actually race
The SVJ and the 812 sit side by side next to my Polo GT in my landlord garage...
This german car destroy everything! I would definitely choose this Porsche 911 turbo S bcz I’ll be sure that i have the best car on the quarter mile!
Porsche: guys sorry I don’t mean to be rude
sir on Lamborghini Gallardo,marciago,cenetario please make a video
wow a base model ferrari beat a performance version model lol that porche 🔥🔥 Ferrari all day
Stop with this "tell us in the comments below " and do a proper in video voting like before. Like if you are tired with this sh*t.
How will the Gt3 do if the turbo beats svj & ferrari
911
Porsche everyday of the week
turbo s
Not high enough iq to drive that car. You need a tesla
I couldn't like yanny and i will never will..
Istimehong
Porsche killing the game rn
I'd take the Lamborghini defenetly
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ by far! My favorite car of all time!
Please do a 2014 to 2016 Mercedes e63s amg against a 2014 to 2016 bmw m5
Svj
Wow that porsche is insane.
Porsche always!
We want to see who could take up a fight against that Porsche.  Bugatti  Koenigsegg Some of my options
WHY are Porsches so insanely quick?
Dude you can't drive a Ferrari for your life if it depending on it. Your too slow
Maaaaannn...30sec advertising and no option to skip🤬
porsche little engine and always destroys everybody
PORSCHE!! All day everyday
Bruh i wish they did a third race
German cars are always the better
awesome content!!
Not a Porsche fan but would take that over the others.
Porsche 911 Turbo S anyday
Can you put standard version of weight and torque for us across the pond?
Germans are celebrating with shnitzles ya
5:52 and here comes the Porsche
Overall I’d pick the Turbo S but looks wise it goes to the Lambo.
German Engineering
For a flashy car the Lambo. For a everyday car that can also pretty much beat anything except for a hyper car would be the Porsche. The Porsche is more reliable as well.
Did anyone see that the Porsche had 2 ppl in it ? If it did then their complete idiots !  And still the Porsche was better then all those over priced super cars , they both have nearly 100hp more than the Porsche and still lost 3 races to the 911 , the turbo is the ultimate best sports car ever made by anyone!!! I’ll have the Porsche over these 2 any day !!
7 Ads, I just can't upvote it, too much
Once upon a time... BMW and Porsche we're all about the driving experience and handling... we don't care about 0-100... 2020 nah fuck it we're gonna crush everyone.
Porsche kills
Ferrari sounded the best for me
Top gear answered this; Buy a Porsche! (It is the better car). Would love a Ferrari (if money 💰 was no object)
I still remember Yianni's quote "What Porsche?!" And now, he make it looks better 😂
Nice race but I find the cars to be too far apart from each other which makes it less interesting
Does the Porsche just have a better launch control system than the other two?
the german beat the italian
Should do same race with a 720S please
Porsche is a silent killer
Porsche, everyday. Quicker and usable. Likely more reliable
Colocar legenda em português, porque eu sou Brasileiro (🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷), e não entendo nada de English
really goes to show lambo desperately needs to update their engines.
In France we have Renault https://youtu.be/vO-vH7jQp6I
svj
Porsche 🔥
Porsche the most fastest and  drivable of the three in the real world.
Porsche by far.....
Love Yanni...and Matt...but Porsche leaves them hen pecking at the club pool.
Me: Patiently waiting and hoping BMW makes a 750HP M8 from factory to destroy all of these.
Lamborghinis are over rated...never really liked them!
I love the looks of the cars with a big front soooo... I will go with that model of ferrari always.
I love porsche....
Laferrari VS Porsche 911 turbo S
Aventador svj far better than ferrari or porsche...
svj
price wise they should have gotten an RS2 Weissach to be in line with the price of the other 2, but that would have been an absolute blowout by the Porsche
911 TURBO S
I’ll take the Porsche over any of these cars anyway ...  #Germanmade Not to mention it seats 4.
rarri
And put those cars on a track and the Ferrari and Lambo will see nothing but taillights
Definitely a Porsche, it is an assuming, and has better money and performance ratio. Definitely a Porsche
Lambo all the way
Porsche ❤️
Dude.. Lamborghini needs to stop trying to force 7 speed manuals into those cars.. 7 speed dct or 8speed auto and it'll be a 9sec car..
5th grade teacher: “Lambo and Ferrari stop smashing the lab mice with hammers. And Porsche, put down that astrophysics books please, we’re talking about colors and shapes”
911 turbo S. I always thought the 911 badge was so you could call for help after it wrecked havoc on everyone.
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Would pick the 911 all day
I am curious to see how the audi R8 will do against the Porsche...
I swear they should put Yainni in the next real Fast and Furious
I will take the Porsche please...
Lamborghini
The 812 really reminds me of a Dodge Viper...
Ur accent is soooooo great
Best drag in carwow so far
Porsche
Lambo sounds superb
So in this race🤔 Matt ignored they Tyre pressure warning and raced the Porsche till he did a hard braking at the end of the runway while Yanni gave Matt another go on the drag race while he is on reserve tank?..... 🤣🤣
Yanni jumped the start in race 1.
I’d honestly go with the Porsche.
Thank carwow, I have been looking forward to seeing this.
The nicest car is the Ferrari
I’d take the Porsche, hands down!
Ferrari sounds better
Porsche!!!
Definitely the Porsche. Pure 6 cylinder performance which should not be underestimated. Pure German
I assume the porsche will win every race😂😂😂😂
SVJ for me
I'll have the 911 Turbo S any any day. By choice and desire. That's the one for me.
@carwow the Ferrari seems unreliable on a drag strip, let alone on a race track.
Porsche was the best
Porsche 911 Turbo S
The most epic drag race ever! Thanks mat!
Yanni cheats on take off
Yesss! Porsche! #1
Can we talk about the Porsche?... NO! 🥴🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
誰の車か知らんけどフェラーリのハンドルのGoPro置くとこグッチャグチャになってて草 やっぱポルシェ強い
Ferrari 812 superfast all day long. That car is absolutely stunning!
You guys are on fire with content lately, keep it up! Mat you make the show very enjoyable with your sense of humor and banter. Aside from the cool cars you make to show! Anyways keep up the great work! Hope you see this Mat lol
Mat u should review the ferrari and lambo
4:01 saw some flames in the svj
I think its OK to retire the Porsche as the King of the runway.
I like the Porsche
What’s the goo you use to mount the GoPro?
I'm an Audi fan, but nothing sounds better than a V12 Ferrari!
And people say 911 turbo s is not a supercar... Well that may be the case. But its definitely a supercar killer.
Ferrari without hesitation
Lambo svj plus the driver come on yannie
Porsche: Am I a joke to you? Yianni: Did someone say anything?? Yianni: Nah, it's Lambo time :)
PORSCHE!!!!
812 all day
cause the ferrari is rear wheel drive
911 Turbo S....still undefeated....
Ferrari without any doubt.
Damn im in love with that porsche
Porsche
Porsche... Insane & pure true performance.
Ones a Ferrari.. the others are Volkswagon 🤣
what happened to the turbo S even in sport plus?
Svj of course, but about that bump with the brakes i also had that happened to me in my dad's Honda pilot and idk what the hell that was but it's fine it works well and everything
Porsche for ever!!!
Omg porsche 😆
That Porsche is so fast it's ridiculous! Matt? Could you put the new Turbo S up against de Porsche 918 Spyder? That would be interesting!
dacia sandero
German Engineering is just unbeatable ...
The spec on that SVJ is nuts
Yanni’s habit of jumping the start is getting really old, really fast
The Porsche is killing everything
I would defo have the Porsche but Ferrari wins on looks
Porsche
Looks, aggressiveness, sound > Lambo SVJ Affordable, beautiful, performance, reliable > Porsche Fancy, sound,  > Ferrari
Superfast for sure!
Porsche like "yes u can do anything with your car i will still kick your ass" while holding cup of coffee
FFS it's a PORSCHE nuff said......
Lamborghini any day
The Porsche would be my personal choice even if cost was no object.  It's quiet exhaust and understated looks fit perfectly with me.  Like me, the Porsche gets the job done without making any fuss or attracting any attention.
GET FROUGH!
Ferrari and Lambo : Let‘s do this! Hold my beer! Porsche : *Manages to beat both while drinking beer on the run
Porsche ❣️
Porsche has to lying about the power, there's no way it beats the other two in a roll.
Lambo
the porsche
I would take the Porsche out of all because those things are no joke
156,000 pounds has beaten the 262,000 and 360,000pounds.
If the lambo had dual clutch it would kill everything.  Can't but the power down with that single glutch
Hey, why don't you guys get the Porsche Carrera GT or 4S on here ??
For the looks, i will take the Ferrari, but for the performance i will take the Porsche.
100% the Porsche Turbo S!! #PorscheForLife
Germans are Germans that Porsche is a  beast and it's cheap too like wtf
Where is American muscles 🔥🔥🔥?
The PDK is brilliant indeed
Did Mat open the Ferrari door with his foot?!?!
I go for lamborghini
Imagine that porsche has 770hp
Wow, I would never have guessed that the 911 Turbo weighs more than the Aventador SVJ.  I would have thought the 911 was the lightest of the trio.  Guess the 911 has been putting on a little weight, eh?
You guys racing not even looking at the porche killed me great video guys my favorite episode so far 😂💪
yani always go 0.1 sec before the girls arm move lol
Had to listen to the sound of that lambos v12 3 times was so sweet
812 or Turbo S !!
The Ferrari for sure
Ferrari
812 Superfast ❤️. Best sounding and won both the rolling races.
All that Porsche needs is an exhaust system and a small tune and you wouldn't need anything else
Porsche every day!!
Lambo won the sound test
Porsche muscle DESTROYS Lambo and Ferrari, also Yianni jumped the start of the first race by a country mile.
You should do porshe tycan vs Lamborghini aventadoor
Waoo waoo waoo Porsche
Lambo obviously sounds better than Ferrari
LAMBO SVJ
Lamborghinis are rubbish. Loudest, most expensive and most ostentatious but often not even the fastest.
Porchea the real king
That 812 any day. Love it. The Aventador is show off, nothing else. Terrible visibility etc.
Porsche é porsche. Não adianta. Esse carro é foda  !!!
Greetings from Germany! The Italianbashing is on the House^^ #GermanCarsJustBetter <3
Yiannimize is just a cringe fest..... facts
I'm gonna have to give sound to the Ferrari, I don't like how it looks but man do I like how it sounds!  As for what I would have, the Porsche, I already want one, I drive a VW, dream car is an Audi RS6 Avant so might as well stay in the family, haha.
Okay so you need Chiron to beat a Turbo S.
Lambo
Does 720s take all of them?
Not sure the Turbo S is the right pick for this race. Feel like you should have gone with an RS
Lamborghini SVJ
Porsche is from a parallel universe... Thank you Porsche... Thank you   Amazing video
Porsche, even though it’s not the most exotic looking, it’s just brilliant and bloody fast
Sausage on top of pasta. All time favorite
Ferrari hands down best lookin car ! Classy n sleek
the Ferrari and Lamborghini were so loud and flamboyant that you literally forgot the Porsche was there
Lamborghini
SVJ dropped 5 meters every gear changed =)))
Model S has also performed a 10.1 against an aventador in a drag race before on this channel. So its basically the same time as the porsche. Matt race them against each other to see who the real king is.
Polamfe🔥🔥
Imagine paying so much for a lambo just to show off.
911 is the camera man of the races lol
That German can take out that Italians even on track
Lets start a petition to bring a Bugatti to carwow
Ferrari
Miss G WAGON. A KING OF SUV
The Porsche won because it’s German.  A lambo is just about flexing, it’s perfect for guys like Yanni, they like to show off.  I prefer a minimalist car like a Porsche.
Porsche 🙌🙌
I'd still take the 812 superfast
Lamborghini Sound is the best :)
The moment you remember the porsche has 6 less cylinders and 3 less liters...
I'd love to know the trap speed of them all at the line.
Porsche is the best! Looks so hot!
Porsche
Ferrari 812
The car I would have the car I'm getting because of this video 911 but that's svj hands down is the best looking car
The moment you remember the Porsche is a 4 seater... & he be like: "I don't need to be loud. I'm german" 😆😆
Long live the king Porsche all day every day🔥🇩🇪
Ferrari all day mate!
Porsche is amazing. ❤️❤️❤️👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I'd have the Porsche it's faster less $ and I'm a fanboy
The disappointment in his voice 😂😂 "yeah....quite a bit quieter" 😂
I will go lambo all day everyday
Great video ... how about a Chevy  Taho , Ford expidiation ,  GMC yukon review 😁
Why do cars have rev limiters now
Lamborghini aventador
Omg i hate Porsche so bad! ferrari and lambo all day every day
6 Cylinders less horsepower still the winner. Germany
i need to see a 720s go against the svj and the 812
FuF lambo and Ferrari are close as hell on the sound test but I imagine if the Porsche didn't have a soft limiter that'd rip too
Clearly there are only two types of cars. Porsche and Other Cars...
I want the Ferrari!  Nice Italian and German accents Matt!
Y el doblaje 😔💔
Svj sound the best
Thats the best carwow video ever
Normal YouTubers:  Mat: iT’ll gO ViRaL iF I diE
That's insane! The Porsche 992 911 Turbo S killed both the Superfast & SVJ in nearly both races. Cheaper & lesser power but faster and lighter. I wasn't expecting it to even beat the SVJ in the standing drag race, but that's insane!
SVJ all the way
Wrong start of lambo i thing
Porche
They always put the guy with mono in the turbo s , and even with his ultra slow reaction times he still comes out on top. Porsche Uber alles!
Yianni lives in a Lambo.
911 Turbo S🔥
Would have Porsche as the would rather have a Ferrari then Lamborghini but if money no problem it not be that shape Ferrari as there are nicer ones out also black does not look good on it
Porsche = Auto perfection. #GOAT
love this video. The porsche represents all of us who hate rich bastards who does not give a shit about driving in general but only about looking good or showing off. The porsche is quietly giving them the finger and i love it
Ferrari seems fast so ferrari it is
The Prosche is so cheap compared to the others because you'll have to buy two to make them last as long as the others 😂😂😂
I think that Carwow could make a race between Porsche's: 911 Turbo S, GT2 RS, GT3 and 918.
Picking the Porsche everyday!!!! The best car all round, excellent value for money and is one of the only hypercars you can daily and is quicker than pretty much anything stock on the planet
The 992 Turbo S is the bargain of the century, but it's something I'd never buy. Between the two Italians, it's not even a comparison - Ferrari 812 SF all day. Aventador has cheap outdated interior, engine that doesn't rev as high nor scream, transmission from the early 2000's, and attracts more dudes than anything else. You don't get there midengine supercar feeling in the 812, but it's still an extremely capable car. Quarter mile in the low 10's with RWD and a screaming 9k RPM V12 - yes please.
Porsche always be winner
812 gts
Here I realised porches are op..
Porsche always be winner
I really would take the 911 for my daily driver here in western Canada. I wouldn't feel bad driving it in the mountains, on the ice roads up north or the gravel highways in the back country. It could double as a rally car right?
Whenever the Turbo S is involved you know it's going to win before even clicking on the video. There is no substitute.
Hahahaha i really love mat!
what in the god's name powering that porsche🥴
Please do a classic cars race
Lamborghini for me.
The Germans better not tickle the Italians, last time Italians got angry with them Germany lost WW1.
911
Those impression were pretty spot on👌😅
Having most horses yet the slowest of the bunch
I would have the lamborghini
Turbo S >>>>> REY indiscutido
I’d take the Porsche hands down. Definitely looks the best. Subtle beauty.
WOW! Porsche! They seriously know how to generate speed
Actually quite impressed with the Ferrari. Rear wheel drive, front engined gt, heaviest also, doesn’t get the best launch but is pulling hard on the others. I bet it had the highest trap speed. In a half mile, I bet it beats the others. That limbo is damn loud. Porsche is just quietly impressive. Masterful engineering...if only it had a soundtrack
Porsche: u dumbs still can't beat me😂😂
The clown in the FERRARI was ASLEEP at the start
Yannie is so heavy, simply! 😎😂
Saludos desde México
Imagine if the porsche have 6.0L
And Porsche is a half engine from the others. Monster flat 6.
Lamborghini Aventador svj
Lambo looks the best but overal package PORSCHE is the beast and I would definitely go for Porsche. For sure 😈🚀👌
Yianni has the fastest reaction time on earth!!!!
That Porsche is menacing. A true “gentleman’s” car. Little talk all action, reserved, poised.
Porsche 911 turbo S!!!!!🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾❤️
Like they say, the bark doesn't bite
It was the accent that got me😂😂😂😂😂
Porsche I’ll have
Ferrari!
911 easy!!!!!
I'll take the Ferrari 812 for 2 please thanks
No point in having a starter anymore with all this preempting let's be real...
Porsche 911 Turbo S i will buy
yianni is absolutely hilarious
You need to race porsche against chiron..it is in hypercar league..
I have a Ferrari and a svj
911 100%
Even though porsche has knocked it out of the park with that 911 turbo but there is something off about Matt driving the Ferrari. The Ferrari 812 seemed slow, although it could catch both. The very first run was totally not right. The Ferrari was too lazy. Matt didn't take it off properly. Whereas the real credit goes to the guy driving the porsche. Judging from the way it took off, whoever was driving it, seemed professional. He drove that porsche exactly the way it should.
All the rich ferarri kids with sideways hats have no idea the punishment about to be dealt when the classy 911 pulls next to them with the driver in his Golf outfit.
hands down SVJ
I'd definitely have the SVJ. Sorry Mat.
Porsche 911 turbo S - Long live the king 👑👑👑
Porsche 👍
Next :765LT vs GT2RS !!
Please put the Porsche on a dyno. I swear those figures are super conservative haha
JS JS JS Volkswagen group wins again
Turbo s is 🥜
the sounds of the Aventador is insane
Porsche sounded the best
Porsche Turbo S is best. Jani was cheating in all the races
What did Germans put in that Porsche???
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Imagine this Porsche with some custom paint job , body kit and  exhaust system  💣💣💣
Porsche. Quick but dull.
Ferrari looks & sounds the best
Porsche sorry  yanni
I want the 812
After this vid my dad said the he is buying the Porsche
Porsche is just something else, they just keep improving on a perfect car. Words fail when I try to describe their brilliance
P 💯
1 Lamborguini SVJ = 2 x 911 Turbo S + 1 tunned 700 hp Audi RS7 from another video in price.  It makes no sense!
Next, going to konigsegg....
Lamborghini, Ferrari let’s warm our tyres up. Porsche, hold my beer.
Porsche with an akrapovic muffler for the win!!!
Lol, love the comedy
Porsche best allrounder.
U brother and yanny are so cool you should guys do more video’s 😇👍💟
Sorry Yianni, Rari looks better lol
Imagine, just imagine for one second, what the new GT2 RS will do.
I’d have the car that doesn’t look like a 5yr old didn’t scribble all over it or looks like it was purchased from Matchbox or Hot wheels with ridiculous stickers all over it.
Exhaust notes.. Ferrari - Tiger's roar Lambo - Lion's roar Porsche - Cheetah's roar(?)
Matt, I keep my 911 TurboS by far. Ferrari as well as Lamborghini looks great, but, V6 vs V12? It is like David vs Goliath!
Lambo all day, Every day.
Honestly the ferrari sounded better then the lamborghini its just has that ferrari sound to it 😊
Id have the Lambo and sell it and buy his and her Porsches.
ferrari 812 super fast 😭😭😭😭 thats shape tho.....killing  me softly 🚶🏻‍♂️💔
I am always waiting for the  ferrari 812 superfast and i think this is the first race for this car give the 812 more races    that was the best video ever on wow car channel ❤❤❤👍👍👍
F12
911, half the cylinders and double the seats.
I remember when you reviewed the 911 it got better and better at its 0 - 60 mph time. I think if one more race was done, it would have gave us that 10.1 or solid 10 seconds time for the 1/4 mile
Ferrari 812 Superfast
That Porsche is actually insane
That Porsche, Jeez
I would get the svj sell it and buy a gt2rs
I'd definitely pick the Porsche not because it's the quickest. Only because it's so unique and so beautiful and underrated.
Porsche
I'd definitely pick the Porsche not because it's the quickest. Only because it's so unique and so beautiful and underrated.
carwow needs a drag racing lights....its always a jumpstart for some since some can't gauge when to launch
Can get Turbo S and turbo S can instead of Lamborghini
Ferrari
Ferrari no doubt
SVJ all the way~~!!!
Yanni's reaction is always epic
5 seconds in and already smashed that like coz the voice acting from Matt is special!😂👌
The Turbo is what you call a freak in the sheets and a lady on the street lol
I'd have the 812
The turbo s is the equivalent of messi in football 😂
I want a Porsche. I seen a grey 2017 GTS convertible for $120k Canadian. Thinking about it......
Papa Porsche  👴  Daddy Lambo    👨  Baby  Ferrari    👶  typical...where’s the Mclaren
Porshe is the better!!!
3.8 Flat six. V12 destroyer
That Porsche is insane! Half the cylinders of the other two!
Aventador svj
I would have the 812 superfast. You can do practically everything, with a V12. Ferrari V12 sounds better than Lambo V12
Can we just shut up and Congrats Porsche to this outstanding Performance🤩
Drag Race  between 918 spyder vs 911 turbo S
Imagine the GT2 RS
812 superfast
Lambo svj
812 superfast all day everyday
Porsche a clear winner 🏆🥂
What the hell is with that Porsche Turbo S? You two are in some exclusive top of the line cars....and that humble Porsche is kicking your buts.
Siperfast is the best looking by a hair
The Lambo looks like a bad ass fighter jet on wheels, but the Ferrari looks like a fast sexy hot female I can't wait to... "Ride - In".
Ferrari sounds the best
We need polls for all the questions you have Mat.
Sound - The last thing Ferrari will get wrong is exhaust note, imo. Lambo was louder but the Ferrari sounded better.  Which I’d rather have: hands down the Porsche. Basically the winner of the day, and is actually the most usable for daily use. Plus I won’t have some snooty Italian telling me what to do with my IG posts.
We all knew the Porsche was going to win.
Yanni is always super excited in a Lambo
Porsche is beast Ferrari is love
S vs SV vs SVJ
Ferrari 🔥
The lambo sounded the best
ferrari
God Porsche was on the ball when they were  designing that car! It has half the cylinders but beats both the ferrari and the lamborghini
Love to see more videos like these
I dont care but that sf is everything!!
Porche turbo s fuh suree
Oare cati romani sunt pe acest canal???🤔🤔  👇
I would choose svj
🇩🇪 Porsche 🇩🇪
ferrari
Just here to see Yianni lose.
SVJ for me. SVJ had too much downforce and drag, without it it wouldve destroyed all. The svj would destroy all around a track
Porsche
Maybe should’ve used the 911 GT2.  A little more in the price range, since the 911Turbo S is half the price of the others.
The 812 and Lambo is the same pretty much the same realistically. It's Yiannis reaction times that makes all the difference 🤣🤣
I have to go with the Porshe. You can drive it every day. It's actually a car you can use when you want to go places really. really fast and even hear the stereo as well.
Love the SVJ BUT the F12 would be a better daily I think
Porsche for the win ... :)
Man that intro was hilarious!!!! Mat you're a legend bro!!! Great content as usual!!!! That porsch didn't sound too hot beside the Lambo and Ferrari but it sure put the power down and took off!!!! 🚗💨💨💨💨💨💨👍🏼
Ok so the Ferrari sounded amazing ...... I just enjoyed seeing the Porsche be in a league of its own 🤤
Definitely the 812
The Porsche is for me the best 👌 and I love it👍
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ all day long.
Give me that Porsche Turbo S
I but the Porsche because not only it was the fastest, the cheapest but it is the only one that you can drive everyday without annoying other people especially the super car haters.
Just reminding everyone that the Turbo S is a 6 banger 😂 WOW impressive... 👍🏼
Lamborghini....period!
Porsche every day... your Lambo & Ferrari will probably need a service, while the Porsche will be fine till next year.
I liked the video once the accents stopped
포람패 드래그 개구리승 ㅅㅅㅅㅅ
Be interesting to see how a GT2RS goes.  Closer in price to the others.
Porsche 911 turbo S
The Porsche 911 Turbo S.  A flat 6 winning over 2 V12
Hah, making a Porsche joke due to its sound... I have a feeling the Porsche will make both of them eat their words and pimp slap the other two cars.  Edit:goes to show, the Italians have the best design/style, I'll give them that, but nothing beats German efficiency. Give me efficiency over a loud barking car any day of the week. 😂🤣😂🤣
i swear carwow got the best drag racers on the internet, i got so excited when i saw this notification.
I’m from Cardiff
But a Horse did win though...
Ferrari is not only the best looking one in  this competition but also the way it sounds is just awesome
Who else is not surprised by the fact that the German smoked the Italians?
Porsche >>>>>>>>>
Love the Ferrari look, but i will take the Froggy all day, sorry Yanni, i dont hate u though lol.
Porsche.
Porsche
LMAO Yianni... OMG the look on his face when he's not winning, it's so so soo sad.
SVG Lamborghini
This would have been a race with the new mclaren 765lt!!
Imagine when gt2 rs coming
Always Lamborghini for me but that Beetle on steroids was a rocket.
This would be good competition to 720s lol but we all know it’s alien technology will beat it all of them roll or drag
Idk about u guys but Loved the entrance!!
Porsche would be ideal call for everyday use and it’s fast af lol
Mat car
We need the nismo or performante. Come on Matt 👌🏾
I feel really bad for some SVJ owners right now. And some Turbo S owners are laughing
I must be the only person that doesn’t really like the Turbo S
that single clutch gearbox fucks up the lambo lol big mistake there
911 turbo S
Porsche 911s
I love Lamborghini but the superfast is a must 💥🔥
Porsche’s have that Nazi engineering UFO technology 🛸
Lambo, but different colour.
Why oh why does the Lambo not have a dual clutch... the single clutch interrupts its performance! I feel as though the violent gear changes throw the car off balance #justsayin 🤷‍♂️
Did somebody say, Just Eat.
the 812 sounds better in my opinion
svj is the best looking car ofc
Everyone tought porache was gonna be destroyed... but it kept up dang
Yianni jumped off the starting line in the first drag race... The second one was a fair one :D
Lambo jumped the start...
i choose the Porsche anytime, any day of the week
i would always get the porsche... we're not even talking about racing, cornering and all that.. besides its german engineering with all the reliability in the world
Porsche 🥇🏆
best sound 812 car i would have 812 f***** superfast all day im a ferrari boy but i love yianni im a cypriot my self. stay safe
Porsche any day of the week, thank you. You can daily drive it Mon - Fri, and track it on Saturday and Sunday. And you can buy 2 of the for the price of the SVJ.
You should do a drag race with the lambo veneno
SVJ did surprisingly well
Ferrari for noise. Add a novitec exhaust and you have the best sounding car in the world! That Porsche is super impressive! Probably take the Porsche for daily driving .
This was such a great video! Yianni’s face haha. X
Porsche🔥
Porsche all day !
Could you make a drag race with smarts?
Porsche... all dayyy long!!
Result.....the Porsche is epic.
I would go with the Porsche❤ It's more daily driver👌
Porsche best Sound xD
The Porsche sounds the best
Porsche humilha com menos potencia, é um mito...
"We don't shout about our performance but we will crush them" lmao germans really be like that 😂
McLaren the Best 😁
Porsche all day!
I really can’t wait for the SF90. Almost a thousand horses, four wheel drive and the instant boost from the electric engines. I never knew the 812 super fast was actually this fast, (pun intended) I always thought the long bonnet V12s are more of a GT. It has some serious performance.
The 812 sounds the best
that 911 is a rockeeeeetttttt!!!!!!!!!!!
911
The Porsche is a Conservative Republican. The Lambo is ANTIFA. The Ferrari Ross Perot.
Begins at 3:39
Ze Germans don’t need massive displacement, they just use massive brains 🧠.
That's 3 to Porsche and 1 to Ferrari. Porsche won the first rolling race.
911 the best German technology
@11.33
11.33
Dont buy Ferrari.
Please vs 720s
German engineering - bar none.
Ferrari and Lamborghini are the two varsity kids with their numbered jackets walking around like they're the shit. Porsche is the exchange student who everyone is trying to figure out what he's about.
Reason: Porsche Emotion: Lambo Passion: Ferrari
Sin dudas PORSCHE es el mejor. Menos potencia, mucho torque y mayor rendimiento. Excelente video!
Ferrari
yaani wants to cry in the second race🤣🤣
Speedometer in the Ferrari lags like....don't know! Terrible!
Porsche all the way baby
Ferrari
The Porsche 911 Turbo S is the better Car, the better Super Car, the better price, better quality! 😉
812 all day
Lamborghini svj all day
My lord the Porsche. I’d take the Ferrari if money were no object. I think Lamborghini has been dull since the diablo.   If money was an object I’d take the porsche and the fact it’s bomb proof.
Porsche
Do a hypercars drag race!!!
The porsche one easy
Without ANY DOUBT; DE 991 TURBO S!! After that, the Lambo by far.
I will go for the Porches
LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR SVJ
Money no object 1) Ferrari 2) Porsche 3) Lamborghini if it was my money I would only buy the Porsche best performance per dosh!
It’s all about marketing strategy for Porsche. IMO
Porsche il soulève tous le monde c’est grave
Tom cruise said it best in risky business..”  Porsche there is no substitute”
Porsche All the Way !!!
Yianni’s gonna rip that steering wheel off it’s column.
imagine the new gt2 🔥🔥
I’ve been a Porsche fanatic since a kid. There will be nothing that will change my mind! Porsche all the way!
I definitely think the Ferrari is the most beautiful here, but I'd have the Porsche just because it's the easiest of the lot to daily
These drag race videos are so boring!!
Si tengo el porsche, con el dinero que me sobra le pongo un sistema de escape mas ruidoso
Lambo looks way better 😂
Looks wise...I'd take  1. Lambo 2. Porsche 3. Rari
Porsche all day everyday.
That Porsche is absolutely bonkers. In this day and age Lamborghinis and Ferraris are literally just for looks if you want a proper Supercar by Porsche.
I swear to anything the ferarri sounds mental , better than almost every car🥵🤤
Do you know what’s suck that v6 can beat v12😬😬
SVJ looks the best 4 sure. If you chose any of the other cars please see an optometrist ASAP
Turbo s
Porsche Walking on them There is no Substitute Porsche #1
Ferrari 812 supersport is one of my dreamest car
That Porsche 911 Turbo S is a different kind of beast. Beats bloody everything. Fantastic engineering. Bravo!
Best looking car, definitely the Ferrari. I’d take the Porsche for practically.
911 is the best the rest are all show and no go
Porsche all the way
The Ferrari is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
if i was still a kid i would chose the lambo.... but now as a adult i would chose the porsche. Not just because its obv a bargain, it just looks so serious and clean. plus im german. nice accent btw :P
It could have been much better if they had made Porsche 911 turbo s exhaust sounds bit more louder  however  Ferrari 812 is a great looking car and makes great sounds as well !
Porsche! 🙌🏼
911TS every time! with that silver color please!
First the Mclaren and now the Lambo and the ferrari...... These germans are crazy 😳😳🤪🤪🤯🤯
I'd take the SVJ with no doubt
Interesting
Freaking love Yianni! Come on....... Uh oh! Lol and I vote Lambo all the way!
Porsche!
Porshe all the way Subtle beast
Yannie  car sound better , haha ha ha hilarious 😂 when he lower his head to be the first haha ha ha.
Matt can you upload video quality up to 4k?
Two willy wavers v the Porsche 😂
911 Turbo S, its really not close.
I’m such a Lamborghini fanboy but damn... that Porsche surprised me! Great fight! 💯
Porsche is better!
@carwow so what happened to the tyre pressure monitoring system? Does it gone when you return the car?
Deutsche Ingenieurskunst
Had a 911 for 8 years and one of the main reasons I haven’t upgraded to the turbo was lack of exhaust sound. I’d still take that new 911 over the other two in this vid though. Amazing.
Absolutely without any hesitation it's gonna be the Porsche 911
The Porsche is the winner.
Lamb talk
the porsche is so much cheaper anyone know what the extra money is for if you buy the ferrari and lambo? all style no bollocks is my opinion
Porcshe 911 turbo S anyday. 😍😍😍
Porsche: is not about the engine its about the gearbox
911 Turbo every time!
Love your content carwow, you inspired me to start my own youtube channel.  Thank you for motivation.
Porsche fans must be dancing of happiness rn
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Damn the Porsche didn’t even need to warm up.🇩🇪
Why would someone dislike this?
Porsche for me before watch the video.
Ferrari😍😍
Svj
Porsche all the way 🥰
Team Porsche baby!
porsche always
Thanks for the all great comments and stay safe and I love your video and I love your car
Should have had a 720s in for the rolling starts
German engineering!
I'd rather have Porche!
812
that porsche aint doing justice anytime soon huh
Out of these 3 cars I would have the svj but I can never afford that on my life ^^  I'm Happy with my 350 and 370z tho  BTW can you dyno that porsche? No way that's making 650hp (I guess it's more like the supra) . Or the other two cars are doing way less and I don't think that is the case.
The Porsche looks like a hot wheels car with the size of those rims
Dyno them! That Porsche has to be kicking out more than 650bhp!!
C'mon race allready
Porsche 911 turbo S 992
Rari
812 definitely best sounding
Let's be honest here, the Lambo looks like a toy car. The Porsche looks like a Porsche and that's not a bad thing.
Come on 911 turbo S
Did he just take the go pro out of the steering wheel 😳
I have seen most the cars are failed in the drag  races can perform in the rolling races, maybe it's due to high end or low torque during high or low speeds. Or could be complex gearing ratios or delayed turbo spooling.
porsche 911 turbo s
Best sounding car on the carwow channel...when the SV crossed the line
I wouldn’t sell out Porsche like that so I’m Porsche team baby
I’d take the Ferrari. For everyday life and reality I’d take the Porsche though. Even though it seems to have no soul :(
That porche looks amazing...
Empty barrels make the vast noise 🤣🤣
Lambo is the best
I would still prefer to have that superfast	 but damn that Porsche is impressive
Porsche natürlich... Deutsch geht immer 💪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
My money would be in the porsche
Bruh you killed those accents🤣
that porche need a straight pipe
Im german and that was not gonna lie a really good german accent haha
Porsche for me!!! Everyday!!
Porsche ofcourse. Lot cheaper and does not look or sound obscene.
Porsche
I bet matt if yianni was in porche he would have done the quatermile in less than 10 secs
Ferrari in this all day!
BTW its not even the GT2RS !!!
I would have the SCJ because it has a faster speed and has way better sound
Lambo definitely looks the best to me but I'm biased towards them as I always had a poster on my wall of them growing up.
Porsche no.1
Take the Turbo S all day long, it’s discretely beautiful and is a stealth fighter. The most iconic sports car on the planet as far as I’m concerned. Easiest to live with, most practical, fastest and the one I want the most regardless of how much cheaper it is.
This Video Has Gone Viral
Porsche all the way
@carwow Just to let know you at 5:24 min play at 0.25x , Yanni Jump started,  before her arms come down he sets off watch closely , just incase no one here noticed ! 🙃
SVJ VS Huracan Performante
Ferrari every day ❤️
"Oooohoooh, Porsche !" That sums it up.
Please, stop saying "porrsh", there is no car named "Porrsh."! It is PORSCHE!
I would have the lambo and ferrari over that dumb Porche
PORSCHE all day everyday. Better looking and better car in general. German engineering > everything else.
ferrari , porsche , lambo
Porsche is the Winner 💪💪🏆🏆🏆
Lmao keep up the accents mate we like it for the intro
"It'll go viral if I die"  - Mat from CarWow, 2020
@carwow, please do a best soundcheck compilation.
dude  ...show time   buy a lambo  or a ferrari   you want to be fast ..buy the damn porche  that thing its a silent killer easy so easy  half money double power  ..Yianniiii ELA KIPROS
It’s one thing to pay premium prices to Ferrari and Lamborghini when they are the fastest cars around, but when Porsche produces a faster car for two thirds of the price of one and half the price of the other, owners would be right to ask the Italians what the hell they’re paying for. I’m on my last Ferrari. Will be a Mac next time or quite possibly (now) a Porsche.
Lamborghini aventador svj
Love how aggressive Yanni is when he’s racing🤣
That Porsche is something out of this world....
911 turbo s , the silent killer . WOW
I would take the lambo for the price than sale it and buy me the Porsche
y cuesta 156,000 dolares
I will take Porsche any day!🔥🔥😍💯🤩🥳
Porsche 👍🏻
money no option i’m taking the 812. unless we were talking a Porsche GT car haha
porsche best looking fastest cheapest so yeah the best car
Porsche  all day
Ese porsche 991es una bestia completa tiene menos caballos de fuerza pero es veloz
I wonder why english guys always say Porsch. Can't be that hard to pronounce the brand properly. Nice video nonetheless :)
What do those germans put in their flat 6 seriously like wtf
Ferrari
the 812 sounds the best by far
Ferrari is better
Anyone else notice the number plate on the Porsche in the thumbnail 😂
Engineering, reliability, technology: Porsche. Styling, strange tyre-pressure warnings and other awful things, need a toolkit when travelling: Ferrari. Somehow boring, German engineering support: Lambo.
That Porsche is on a 24/7 adrenaline rush 😂😂 where the Fuck the German found this recipe? 😂😂😂
812 superfast sounds best
Porsche ❤️❤️❤️
Ferrari
Porsche King of the road
Porsche all day long....
Porsche beat the Ferrari and Lamborghini while having back seats and being the most comfortable
Porsche looks elegant. Lambo is a bit overkill in my opinion
911
I would actually take an Aventador SV roadster. Best car ever made.
Porsche without a doubt
Yanni always fire the line
Where is the 765LT 🔥🔥🔥
Porsche simply is the best car ever
11:32 when the producers don’t want you on camera so you spite them with a video bomb
Farrari is the best looker
That german accent xDDD
No one talking about how sexy that 812 superfast is. Damn, it makes the other two cars look ugly. And that speaks for itself
From the Porche my favourite model is of course 911 turbo, and from the Ferrari is aswell my second favourite on the first place is Pista 😎😀 the Lambo is insane,  anyway I was expecting the Porche gonna win coz this 911 turbo it's top of the engineering from  Porche or any other brands like the v12's  so Matt I would choose the 911 😁😎👌👍💪 maybe the Ferrari it's more beautiful and the SVJ as well but this 911 turbo (992)model it's very very beautiful one of the best 😉 it's a beast 💪👌👏💣💎  it's just my opinion ☺
Best intro ever😂 Matt is with the accents 😂😂😂
The dobre brothers basically have all these cars except the 911 Turbo I know Marcus has a 911 GT2 RS...
Porsche besstttt.
Porsche ❤, Germany 🔥❤
Porsche: Das cüte
I would like to have the Lambo sell that one buy a Porsche Turbo S and a house
911 ....say no more 😊
PORSCHE a reliable daily super car killer!
Would ever take one of the two Italians......
Lamborghini sounds was the best🖐🏻🖐🏻🖐🏻
i think the aventador svj is faster in nurburgring trass
Gt2rs 992 gonna be crazy
Please make a hummer only drag race
Porsche all the time.... 🚘🚘🚘
Porsche all day
That Porsche Turbo looks like it's just taking a leisurely stroll through the neighborhood.
Where can I get that Lambo hat?
Ferrari, has my vote for my car. style and looks and yet useful.  but never the Porsche.
Hitrel would be proud of porsche cars. Adlof thats him i meant.
Porsche sounds best
Porsche you can drive it daily and you don't have to be afraid  to put miles on it, where other two cars are maintenance nightmare.
Lamborghini voice should be German accent, no? Owned by VW, ruined by Audi.
I'd pick the Ferrari over the lambo everytime
the car that i would pick is the ferrari cuz i’m a ferrari guy but that porsche is amazing
Top tip......the video start at 3min 40 sec, all jibber and ads before set time :(
Porsche 992 Turbo S
07:24 When your girl wants to argue
Sorry Matt but I would definitely have the SVJ
That Porsche has a 8 speed gear box while the others got 7..so make sense it would push better down the line
Really, the race is between whatever Yianni and Mat are driving. The 3rd guy is always the spare wheel.
The Porsche 911 Turbo S is amazing!!!!
Porsche fastest and best looking. Just a bonus that you can get 2 for the price of one of the others!
Do Porsche 911 Turbo S vs Bugatti Chiron vs Koenigsegg Agera RS
Ferrari sounds best
Porsche 911s the king
PORSCHE the BEST
Lamborghini SVJ
Lambo forever :)
Ferrari
Your videos awesome if you show the speed of car during race is more awsome
For the money and legacy/heritage: Porsche For the looks and sound: Ferrari.
That Porsche is a beast.
It's like I'm in an orchestra with my headphones on
porsche  👍
Porsche smashes both and can only imagine how even crazier it would be with just a tune!  Makes it look effortless and will handle abuse that the Ferrari and Lambo can only dream of! The only thing it lacks is the drama :)
Those german engineers are definitely doing something right.
Porsche all the way especially for the money ,extra money just go stage 3 n I'll b a wrecking ball
That Porsche is a serious weapon and bang for the money 💰.
Lambergene  Aventador svj
The starter girl really needs to hold the 1 before she drops her arms a different amount of time every time. They're not even waiting for her to drop the arms anymore since she has by this point become so predictable (7:02)
5:20
so, cheaper and faster.  porsche once again proves that whoever buys lambos and ferraris are buying them for other people, not for themselves.
Admit it, you came here just to see Yianni's facial expressions and to hear him say "COME ON!" lol
The 911 hands down. And yes, it looks way better than the other two!
The Porsche torque wins it.
the ferrari sounds the best🤤🤤🤤
911
When it really counts - an in gear charge down the tarmac, it's great to see that the responsiveness of both the naturally aspirated engines comfortably beats the Porsche. A screaming naturally aspirated engine will always be more fun than turbo boost. They may be a dieing breed due to being so thirsty and bad for the planet, but for the motoring purest, it's NA all day long over turbos and electric.
Money no object, Ferrari all day. But, on a budget (lmao budget?) clearly the Porsche has it nailed down.
Porsche foor liffe
My son would like the lambo. I’ll get the rarri
Porsche is my dream car so...
Porsche
Ferrari
Damn,Not sure how Porsche does it but they JUST.KEEP.DOIN'.IT.
Porsche 👌👍all the way
Ferrari over all for me.
I honestly think the Porsche sounded better because it wasn’t ear rape
If I had to own one.. for show.. Aventador    The performance stuff is interesting but irrelevant on real roads  So what looks coolest   Porsche is yet another VV beetle  the Ferrari is meh  Lambo smacks you in the face
WATCH THE BUGATTI CHIRON VIDEO. THIS GUY STRAIGHT UP LIED. NOT ONLY IN THE TITLE FOR THE VIDEO, BUT ALSO IN THE VIDEO WHERE HE REACTED AS IF HE WAS IN A CAR DOING 300 MILES PER HOUR, INSTEAD OF 300 KILOMETERS PER HOUR. IF THAT WAS HIS GENUINE REACTION TO 186MPH, THEN HE IS UNFIT TO DRIVE EXOTIC CARS. THIS GUY WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO DECEIVE HIS AUDIENCE. HE HAS TO BE CALLED OUT ON THIS UNTIL HE GOES FOR A RIDE IN A SUPERSONIC JET.
Yanni: "Can I borrow your SVJ for a simple car review Matt's doing?" Owner: "Mate, no one's ever driven this car but me. Ever. Promise me you'll be easy on the mechanicals" Yanni: "Of course mate." (engages drift-mode) "See you next week"
Porsche is a bargain for the price! Would buy the Porsche right away. Best car ever!!!
812 superfast
THE PORSCHE SOUNDED THE BEST STFU  Oh and I would have the Lamborghini tractor from the 1900’s
I cant decide between loosing Yanni and winning Yanni 🤣🤣
Matt also jumped the start on the 2nd drag race
Yannie mouth is more louder then the cars lol
I'll get SVJ
Definitely Porsche! Quiet, fast, deadly!
Porsche
Hail to the king Porsche
Porsche all day long
Ferarri sounds like f1😂
If money was no object I would still have the 911, would be able to drive it without feeling like too much of attention grabbing wanker
Great for those who own a Porsche, even if it's only a 718 (982) 😎
I have a Turbo S on order, so my choice is obvious.  BTW, your Italian accent is better than your German!  Great channel.
Love the Porsche
911 t s
SVJ just looks so good
Turbo S has been doing this since like 2013 lmao
Im a bull myself but that horse pffffttttt maddd (may)
Ferrari looks the best I reckon.
I'm not a big Porsche fan but you have to give credit where credit is due that bitch is fast especially given how much those other two cars cost
Ferrari 812 Ultrabest but Porsche is still good
I'd take the Lambo anyday!       sell it and buy 2x Turbo S's
Money no object, would get the Porsche first, Ferrari very close second. Sorry Yanni not feeling the Lambo.
Porsche for the win!!! ";-)
You guys need to start doing 1/2 mile Races... these cars need SPEED!!!
What I would like, the performance of the Porsche, the design of the aventador and the exhaust of the Ferrari, and the brakes of the Porsche too 🤣
Decisions decisions....oh wait I'm poor
Besides the performance, why do people even compare Lamborghini design to a ferrari? Lamborghinis look million times better and more aggressive 🔥
Where's McLaren 720s?
The superfast and svj are good, but Porsche has been in my heart since I have heard of it! 🚗
Porsche
Porsche is worth every penny
I'd have the svj, then sell it and buy an porsch and a nice Audi lol
Superfast my ass
Ferrari best sounding Ferrari is second best Porsche best but needs to sound better lambo ok
Lamborghini
Lambo.
The looks of the porsche are cleaner .    like if you agree
Sonst echt geiler Kanal
Bester Porsche EU West und ich hasse es wie wie Engländer/Amerikaner Porsche aussprechen es heißt Porsche nicht Porscheeeee😂
Porsche a new King!!
No matter how you look at it. The defining determination at least is how well it does on the Nurburgring track. As far as I can remember the fastest legal car is the Lamborghini aventador SVJ!
Porsche is a dream come true! Stronger and more agile than the numbers suggest.
LOVE Porche LOVE!!!
Awesome race!
Seriously how good is the P turbo S... holy sh*t...
Yo someone tell yanni to bring the Paganini huayra tempesta out 😅
If you add cornering and such that Porsche will become even more dominant.
Ferrari is the best car
Just imagine If Porsche builds a 12 cylinders supercar. Man ,not even a rocket will stop the beast.
The Ferrari and the lambo can both be V12 but for me the Ferrari sounds way better 😅
Svj>812>porsche
If Yannie is in the video it’s gonna be so entertaining... lol this guy is hilarious!
I love how they're not even talking about the porsche
Yianni defiantly jumped the start on the first go 🤣😂
Lamborghini
Yianni. What an arse. Imagine borrowing the car and then “warming up the tyres” like that. Brags about “killing the Ferrari” after he jumped the start. Less than 6 mins in and I want to turn it off. So glad the 911 smoked him.
Man, I can't get enough of Porsche. Not even gonna lie... those Italians are way more impressive regarding looks and sound... but Porsche, man those guys know engineering like no other. Impressive. None less.
812 not so superfast 😂😂😂🤣
Aventador
4:30 is it the sound of taycan????
Porsche for the win for sure.
Ferarri 812 superfast
Try this drag race again but with a huracan
It's giving the tire pressure warning ugh f**k off 🤣🤣🤣🤣 8:19
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, I've already configurated one.
Porsche
Porsche wins the sound challenge because it’s not an obnoxiously loud shitshow as the other two
Definitely one of the best videos in a while !
Porsche all day long
Porsche is the best all round, Ferrari looks the best and lambo sounds the best
I didn’t think the Porsche was going to win but I love Porsche yay for me LOL Ouch I doubt it my own car
Definitely Porsche 911
😂😂😂
Lambo all day everyday
Either you’re slow Matt or Yani keeps jumping the line
HEY The porsche is not stock
The porsh 911 is the best
911 just blew both supercars into pieces. Battle was between the Ferrari and Audi.
911 for me
The 911 turbo since the 80’s has been the ultimate supercar
The Porsche flies down ....😐
Porsche all the way
The best one, 911.
I knew the Porsche was gona kill them, cos it made no revving noise an is the cheapest, Ferrari an lambo should be embarrassed with ther pricing 😂
Ferrari allday everyday
people underestimate the porsche 911 turbo s so much it may sound like a garbage truck but its immensely fast which is why its performance speaks for the car
The very fact that the 911 Turbo S is so perfect makes it a weakness because people will still buy the bull and the horse for the noise and looks before coming to their scenes and buy a Porsche
SVJ
SVJ. I'm a Lambo lover
The prettiest Car is the Porsche
Empty heads make a lot of noise
Best looking car: Ferrari                                             Best sound: Lamborghini                                           Best car: Porsche
Why is that Ferrari so heavy??
911Turbo S.  The everyday supercar killer. Lamboghinis are crass now.
Porsche is that kid that everyone picks on before a maths test and gets the highest
I ll have the 812
Ferrari😍
I would have the aventador svj
Chuck some rain and rubber deposits and a bit of spilled diesel into the equation and there is only one real world winner. The other two are better off polished and left in a garage to appreciate.
911 all day everyday!!
I've noticed that Matt and Yanni are more than the sum of them. I enjoy each other's channels, but they seem to have more fun, when they film together.
Lamborghini aventador svj is the best
Porsche is all trousers no fur coat
That intro got urlself a new subcriber 🤣🤣🤣🤣👌👌👌
812 superfast
911 , the Best car , end of .
911
Porsche! Best performer, best price, not so ostentatious... and will do this all day... the others also, if they are very lucky! 😊
„Germans“ !
I like the 911 turbo s
Porsche be like : Fuck off fighting. Imma head out.
I’ll go with the Porsche
Porsche all the way
Porche with new exhost
You should do more than just straight line speed and braking, let’s see some cornering!
Got to be the ugliest looking Ferrari ever no wonder the formula one Ferrari has gone backwards
Am I the only one that noticed that the Lambo didn’t win anything?
The best drag race eveeeeer
That Porsche is incredible
Porsche is better car than both
This Ferrari looks stupid good :P
Impressive the Porsche 911 Turbo S, the least attractive and the least expensive and wins everything.
Porsche all the way no doubt about it
So many stupid comments here...Turbo S is a extreme efficient car for drag and straight line speed. The heavy boxer in the back, transmission and perfect allwheeldrive are nearly unmatched. On the other side you cant compare modern turbo cars with NA cars, even with big V12 engines. They are big and strong but the efficiency is far away from the modern turbo cars. So stop talkingstupid shit like Porsche did it with half of the engines and so on, it shows that this sort of shittalkers didnt know anything about tech specs... Any way great comparison and highly entertaining. A comparison between 720S/765lt-488 Pista and Turbo S would be great. In dragrace the Porsche would best them too
Do the Skoda vRS drag race together with Skoda Fabia I vRS 1.9 TDI 130 HP vs Fabia II vRS 1.4 TSI 180 HP vs Octavia I vRS 1.8T 20V 180 HP vs Octavia II vRS 2.0 TSI 200 HP vs Octavia III vRS 2.0T 245 HP vs Kodiaq vRS 2.0 BiTDI 240 HP vs Superb III FL 2.0 TSI 272 HP
Ferrari. Lambo is too over the top and Porsche is too common.
I would have  Porsche 911 Turbo S
I've driven two different Lamborghini Huracans and at 6'2 250+ i don't fit in them so no to Lambo. Id take Ferrari 912 Superfast and then Turbo S. Have driven a Ferrari 488 GTB and 912 GT3. Loved them both
Ok this is the 200th time I’ve come back to listen to the accent. Only a few of my friends haven’t been forced to watch it by now.
I have been expecting this comparison for a long time
You have to jump start to take the Porsch, just love it
i don't know if you've noticed but it's always mat watson who loses the races🤣
Porsche
Ferrari foe surrrre
GO PORCHE 👋👋👋👋
I prefer my 992 911 turbo S. My tacky friend has a lambo.
Turbo S !!!!!!!!!
Every time someone counts down 3...2...1, I hear the sound of the starter girl 😂
Six cylinders crushing it!
Im fan Bmw and Porsche have 12 cylinders ,Holy  fuc*king s*it
Svj
SVJ jumped the start and still got smacked by a German vacuum cleaner.
PORSCHE!!
Every time I see a drag race with that 911 Turbo S, I expect it to be quick, but not always the quickest. Their 6cyl engine, their trans and their awd system is insanely well tuned and efficient. It's just crazy what they can accomplish with so much less displacement and power, really. wow.
It would be amazing if you could do like the old style top gear challenges with different type of cars as well as different scenarios.
Turbo S is the most great looking car here
Porsche with half engine, was winning the drag 👍😅🤷
Lol Yanni kill me every time.
812 superfast
Ferrari
The reason why lamborghini is lighter is because you said the dry weight of lamborghini but curb weight of ferrari and the dry weight for ferrari is as the same as lamborghini which is 1525 kgs
Without watching the video and at 0:00 i will choose the 812 everytime. even if it lost at all the challenges
The moment you remember the Porsche is a 4 seater...
How is this Porsche so fast? I guess turbo cars in general have more power in rpm's where NA cars are just completely dead. More usable power range, instead of really sharp peak power curves and nothing in lower and middle rpm's.
FERRARI BUY 1000 miles. Then the porche
Best looking: 911
190mph in the Ferrari, Porsche, and lambo damn
German Engineering 🔥
That porsche should be drug tested.
Performance: Porsche Sound: Lambo Looks: Ferrari  No doubt 👌
Svj
Ferraris are dead for me. The Audi Oh sorry Lamborghini Looks way better :D    PS: I dont think i need to mention the ugly Porsche :D
Ferrari
Potsche
Porsche is like : I'll hold my own bier danke!
That Lambo totally isn`t worth...
yanni way better at launches lately or jumping! Hmmmm
SVJ ofc
Ferrari super fast 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ferrari
Yanni had false Start!!
Yianni always cheats and jumps the start. You can clearly see his car moving before the girls hands move from the vertical position.
So its not a 63.
Looks: Ferrari Sound: Ferrari Speed: Ferrari Acceleration: Porsche  Braking: Porsche   Best Overall: Ferrari
Italiano car is funtastic....  Hmm numero uno. 😁
That's a ridiculous amount of adverts. Two full length 20s ads at the start and another two 5s ads just 3 minutes in. Fucking hell guys.
the ferrari sounded better to me
Turbo s is better
I’d personally take the lambo but damn Porsche now makes one of the quickest and the best handling cars.
most shit Italian accent ever
Porsche any day
Wow.... Just wow.... 😳😳😳😳 Didn't expect this type of performance from Porsche, with Lambo & Ferrari in the field.... Really, Ferrari & Lambo🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️
Instant like for the accents
Damm, is that SVJ exhaust stock, it sounded really good
Please Porsche 911 GT2 RS 🙏🏻
Porsche ofcourse
defenetly the Porsche!
I would have the 911 if I need to pay for it. If it’s a no money involved, then it’s the Ferrari, it’s just the most classy car between the three.
Someone really needs to tell Yani that he is suppose to go when the hands drop and not when the hands stop in the top position.
Porsche be like: "I don't need to be loud. I'm german"
Two 911 Turbo S
911 is that much more of a better car then
911
It was really nice of them to involve the Porsche driver in the vid ...NOT...why not ...if it wasn't for the fact that I wanted to see the cars perform there would be no other reason to watch this vid  🤦‍♂️👌
GT2RS vs GT3RS vs TurboS????
The porsche is silent but deadly
It's a shame that Porsche muffles the car noise now :(  Best cars on the planet
Ferrari
Porsche absoluut that Porsche, luck at the price difference between the tree.
That turbo S is a hell of package !!!
I’ll say the rari sound the best no cap
Poche of course !
Porsche
Thumbs up if you fast forward to just the race, watch it, then leave
Turbo S
IF Money was no Object none of them, i would pick a Zonda 😉
In my opinio that Ferrari sounds the besst
The Porsche hands down 😃
Best car : Lamborghini SVJ
I will have all of 3 personally  All of 3 they are so my style 👐🏻
Порше сделал НАКАЗАТ !!!
Lambo errrday mate
So it’s got nothing to do with turbos and the size of the engine, the PDK is the devil.
V12 ❤
I mean one would only buy the ferrari or the lambo if they were over compensating the porsche is the best imagine spending so much on a lambo only to get thrashed by a porsche 911
The Ferrari sounds the best
Even though its not the best over all car, I’d take an 812 SF all day. Maybe even in that bat mobile spec - lovely.
I'll just say that this is the best sounding race yet. Just change the 911 for an LFA and it'd be sound porn
Deffinently Porsche
RIP black panther
Porsche.
812 superfast, but a Mansory Stallone ❤️❤️
Porsche❤
Great content keep rolling mate
I absolutely would always take the Porsche over any other car
Sound Lambo looks Ferrari
Porsche ❤️
Best part of the video, Yanni putting his head forward like a track sprinter to try get that edge on the Ferrari 😁😁😁😁😁
Sorry 😐 I’d go for the Porsche 😎
The SVJ sounds and looks the best of the bunch. Easily.
Lambo guy bolted a split second before go...and still lost.  Porsche > rest of the chumps.
Race 1, Yanni jumped the start Again! ,dudes a cheat! He does it way to often!
The car that sounds the best - SVJ The car that looks the best - 812 The best car - Turbo S The car I can afford - Dacia Sandero
I just spent ten days with the 911 Turbo S and it is mind warping just how quick it is. Only car that gives you that feeling that nothing on the road is faster and you can happily drive it in the real world.
Porsche all day!
Of course I would had a Porsche.
Let's record some tuned Supra vs lamvo
Your German talking was truly apropos. Would you repeat the same comic scenario with French when testing the Bugatti, as you informed us about the forthcoming invitation of Bugatti.
The Porsche prove that (Less is more ) is the right thing to do .
8:57 Yanni’s face 😂
oh please don't put that Yanni guy in your videos anymore, he reminds me of a low IQ chipmunk, he's so hard to watch, I always have to skip forward in your videos just to cut him out.
I would have the 911 turbo s
Porsche every day , all day.
Yanni pulls away too early, sort that out, he's a great guy but it's wasting the point of doing it (not the second race in the vlog but he does it consistently)
The Turbo S is the car to get. FFS. Ridiculous, chaotic, uberrapid nonsense.
"the water sensible Porsche 911 turbo s, we are more restrained than the Italians and we don't like to shout about our performance, but we will crush them" 😂😂😂
So they ignored porche as if it's not there
i feel like the 812 didnt grip quick enough
Its okkkk its 2 Italian supercars against a german beast
I'm a Lambo fan, but out of these 3, the SVJ would be my 3rd pick.
Porsche Turbo S.....there is no substitute. 💪
I would have the lambi
I was rooting for the Porsche to be honest, they're master engineers.
I would go with Lamborghini Svj it looks like a demon and Matt’s car looks like suv not a sport car
SVJ for sure🔥
I am a Ferrari fan but that is not to say I love every single Ferrari ever made. From these three cars; the Lamborghini has a good sound but the Ferrari is equally good. They are so close in the sound department that I would call it a tie. The Ferrari got the heritage and I think is better looking than the Lamborghini, that Lambo is really ugly and too bombastic in the style. It is trying too much to impress people calling too much for attention. Now, this Porsche is classy in its design, it has finesse in the style, it does not need to call for attention. It is a mature car and on top of that performance wise is the best of the three. Then you could add that is the most usable on a daily basis situation. Porsche wins this one in a landslide!
The Superfast looks better than all of them.
Man that accent was awful lmaoooo
Still waiting for the drone shots so we can see “what exactly happened”
Only carwow can drag a 30 second race out into a 13 minute video, also yiannis hat 😂
That black Superfast its a Masterpiece.
11:32 a deserved smug head turn and smug face lol
SVJ👍
Ferrari = Ferrari Lambo = Yianne Porsche = DID I STUTTER?
i love Porsche and is the best in my opinion  my blessis from spain
you want what Ferrari won at racing, so I'll take the 812.
The lambo sound is so good wow I was expecting the porche to win rolling race lol
Porsche
The cheap car wins!
Lambo jumped the start ... surprise
Carwow should have their own “Stig” and have a track times for each car they test.
I love the lamborghni aventador SVJ
5:06-5:08 Mat’s face watching Yanni doing the half donut thing = dead 😂
You shouldve given the time of the lambo from the first race because it probably was around 10.2
Even if it came 3rd on the drag race it did amazing for a rear wheel against the 4 wheel drive. And of course would choose the Superfast it's so beautiful and the sound of it you can recognise it from miles away that is a ferrari
The Porsche 911 is an amazing car
Porsche 👍
Ferrari 812
Lamborghini
I would have the Porsche tho
I think Yannie jumped the start in the first one..
Porsche man! 😳
SVJ made the best sound !
BEST drag race yet!!!  Hilarious, perfect, and oooo these cars!!!!  Money no object, I'll have the SVJ.  It always looks fast, it'll always make you feel like a 10 year old, even at a stop light.  If it's my dollars and cents, including service, it's not even a question for the Porsche.
812 super fast for me...
Off course the 911
That porker is a Beast
Lambo pulled off far to early in the first race.
That porker! Haha and it's the turbo s, the italians are just sublime in every way, but when things do start to look like they are bearing down on the porsche... there will be a gt 3 or 2! And then what!
The Porsche would be a great car if you live next to a Karen
No one: Yanni: KYAAMMMM ONNNN
Lamborghini still the best looking so I can settle for 3 seconds less.
Second run Ferrari Jump start...
812 superfast
The battle of the horses and the bull.
Svj
Porsche!!!
Ze germans strikes again
I'll have the Porsche over the Lambo and Ferrari infinite times
Got to be the Porsche just a classic bad boy machine and cheapest
the svj is better in a circuit, the porsche is better off the line, the ferrari is the best looking and the one with faster acceleration at higher speeds
I'd had the Porsche or the Lamborghini if money was no obstacle. I could only decide if I saw the cars in person.
The Porsche won even having a USB stick as a gear shifter 🤷🏻‍♂️
Hey Matt, can you get McLaren 765lt vs the 911 turbo s? Now that would be a race
all the way Lambo
Definitely a Porsche 911 992
Great race guys. Id definitely would have the 812 Superfast!!!!
812
Bruh they really sacked Matt and replaced him with the third Mario brother that was just a disappointment
"C'mon Lambo, we don't care about the Porsche" 😂
Porsche 911 turbo s all day long.  The supercar killer 💪🏾😃👍🏾.  Awesome Race!
Am still getting the Lamborghini though.
The competition between you two guys is unprecedented...lol
Change the exhaust on the 911 and yeah... 911 all day
Yeah
Best race yet!
MAT , LOVE THIS CHANNEL MATE YOU HAVE THE BEST DRAG RACES ON YOUTUBE BY FAR , I'M NEVER DISSAPOINTED ,KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK BUDDY👌👍👍👍👍👍👍
Porsche doesn't even need you to hold his beer.
Ferrari sounds the best
Man, that Ferrari is a piece of art
What the devil is that Porsche? Damn
Porsche 911 Turbo S
5:20 race starts
Porsche all tha way!
Considering price, Porsche for sure...
Am seeing the starter LADY clearly for the first time ♥️♥️. Whoelse saw her for the first time clearly 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
Are we just gonna ignore that the Lamborghini had an unfair head start twice?
Can we get a Dodge Viper in here?
Damn! been waiting for this one!
Turbo S❤️❤️❤️
Complete W anchor
The Porsche is a beast 👑
Larga vida Porsche 911
Matt defo jumped the start in the second drag 😅
Once again…… the 12 Cylinders cannot cope with that 911 Turbo S in the quarter !
German engineering.... Porsche there is "no substitute".
I hope one day, someone brings a twin turbo Lambo to this channel, one build by UGR :)
🇩🇪 🇩🇪 there is no substitute 🇩🇪 🇩🇪
Please bring the Calvin from calvin’s cat diary to one of this races ! He’s a legend ! And has a lot of amazing cars
That Porsche is a freaking beast 🔥🔥
Ill take the porsche
The Porsche lowkey flattened the performance Italian V12s. So er yeah, I'd have the low key German monster rather than the flashy pansies.
HAHAHAHAHA i loved the intro Matt!!! You're Awesome!
Before I watch this I'm going to say the 911 is taking this
Leave the Lambo at home next time...the Ferrari is stunning but the Porsche, wow, just wow!
The 812 looks the best and sounds the best. Never been a fan of the Aventador engine sound. It sounds very tinny and artificial
I'd have the Porsche
I have to pick the Porsche, been a fan boy since I was a boy. Also it just destroyed two 'supercars' 🤣 🤣 🤣
Porsche is by far the best and better looking. Classic elegance.
FERRARI 812 !!
Lack of traction obviously killing the superfast.
ferrary sounds best
Moving race 50mph in sport mode 812 will win double the price triple the class.! Ive owned two turbos great cars but if I had the money its V12 naturally aspirated prancing horse
The best thing about the 911 is that you can drive it to your destination without having to stop at 3 mechanic shops along the way.
Sorry Yanni, you jumped the start. You got off before her hands were down. No pun lol.
Am I only the only one to think this guy is a wanna be prat?
100% Ferrari not Lambo
Turbo S all day long 😍
Am not into sport cars, but between these 3 cars, I would have the Ferrari, if I had a million dollars 😂
Porsche może i nie jest najładniejsze ale zapierdala aż miło.
I prefer the porsche. It can be used for daily drive. Also with the price of SVJ, you can own the 911 turbo S + a bentley.
Carwow please get a McLaren P1 versus any all electric car. And whatever else you can get ahold of.
911 Turbo S, holy wow, a brilliant thing on wheels...
812 Superfast
@matt what was the timing for the first drag race
I'd rather have the Ferrari. With it's looks and sound plus the performance...my god. Dream car.
If you all want a fast car....buy a porsche!!! Amazing.
The Ferrari has a big bum I personally wouldn’t drive that
RWD V12 all day!
Porche
Porsche all the way!
Vote: Ferrari 812 Superfast
911 is unbelievable and at half the price ...great video Matt
Turbo S 💪🏻🏁😎
il tuo italiano fa schifo ❣️😂
Porsche is a masterpiece
Porsche 911 turbo s
With less cylinders...that Porsche is special.
I want the Porsche. By far.
Blacked out Superfast 😍
Porsche is the best for me, sound wise the ferrari is the best :)
911 Turbo S anyday....Monster of a car!!!!
give me 1200 hp Nissan r35 gtr
911 turbo s vs huracan evo?
Look at how Mat opens the door 10:26
two german cars and one italian fancy car.....really i wonder who's gonna win
Porsche definitely 🇩🇪
Ferrari...
911 all day long
I had to turn my volume up for the Porsche 😂😂
Man,Yanni's face just steal the show 👑👑👑👑👑😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
PORSCHE
FERRARI is my choice.
Duo Power !!! :))))
Ferrari ❤🐎🐎🐎
Lamborghini svj
I'd like to see these two losers with the new BMW M8 Competition
I like how every other race yanni is like what porsh. Now its like what porsh!
Yanny jumps the start every time! Spoils it...
If it's not 2 to the porsche, 1 to the Ferrari and 0 to the lamborghini, you are only thiking about yianni witch makes this video ankwardly pointless
I love this episode.
Lamborghini looks the best..
Porsche was faster, but ferrari and lamborghini gave the show.
That porsche is stupidly quick
German Engeneer is the best of building cars for a long time, respect ✊ from Moroccan 🇲🇦 mechanic 👨🏽‍🔧
ferrari
Damn. That Porsche is something else. All three cars super sexy though. I’d take the Porsche as my daily driver, the Ferrari for weekends away with the wife and the Lambo for when I’m in a fvck you mood.
That Porsche is absolutely amazing for the price. Porsche is just ahead of all of the competition for the last 10yrs. Also the most reliable and least expensive to own. You could daily drive this car and then destroy all of the competition.
Lambo fanboy here. Best looking car is the Ferrari. Classic beautiful lines.
That ferrari should not be called superfast😂
Tune the 911 to 700 hp.  Then race them.  911 would destroy them agin
812 al the way
I must be dreaming, because my dream car are racing each other right now.
Temperature warning for the tyre (maybe not pressure)?
Porsche 911 turbo S hands down
Bro if there is a sound teat just bring a turbo straight pipe Supra. But if it must be stock if there is lambo then bye bye competition
How funny people with twice more expensive car how gentle accept the second place 👏👏😂😂
Porsche—no drama just dominance.
Never saw someone so happy to finish 2nd in a Lamborghini.   911 is amazing.   1/2 the price.
The porsche though😍
Please add Porsche GT2 or GT3 or Both
Porsche all day!
We want a race with a Bugatti.. please!
If i was offered any of these cars id still take the turbo s. Will likely outlast the other two and its really pretty and classy
Italians are like look at our super rocket looking 12 cylinder supercars and the german is like shhhh i got places to go I am buzy I need to crush you and keep going. No time lets go!!
Poorsheeee
Porsche any-day, smart man car
911 all the way
911 turbo s does 1/4 in 10.2 possibly 10.1 ferrari and Lambo does around 10.6 the gap should’ve been bigger but the 911 turbo s driver is never good at drag racing only if yianni or Matt was in the 911
Porsche 911 (992) Turbo S ❤️
lambobullshit and porschitness are both owned by the same company (Porsche SE) same compagny that owns VW. Same VW that has been accused to created at least 49 death and accused to have reduces the life lenght  of at least 50'000 persons due to the diesel scandal. So saying Porsche AG makes great car is not knowing about the court situation in many countries. Stop worshipping these companies. You have no idea about how much they dont care about public health.
yanni false started....again.....Porsche looks the best is the best...probably will alst longer. Yanni must be a leo....has to be. Loyal to lambos but always be losing in them lol...funny
One German destroying two Italians. 🤷🏽‍♂️🤣🤣
Yanni : If it’s a Lamborghini it can only be me . Kane : are you sure about that
It must suck to spend half a mil on a Lambo and get raped by a 911.
Ferrari all day
German engineering. 🤷🏽‍♂️
I like how the SVJ and 812 are having an epic battle while the 911 is just minding its own business 😂
812
Porsche and with the money i can save against the Lambo maybe i'll buy a second one for weekends
Porsche. Silent and deadly
Porsche for the win
Lamborghini
I would have the SVJ
Lamborghini aventadoor maybe svj
I had to check if it was not a Italian Carwow channel😂😂😂
911 turbo s VS everything )
Yanni, driving on the fuel reserve might reduce the power output dude! I would take the ferrari because it is the real fun car
Wow, porsche has beaten the shit out of these two others in every aspect
The Ferrari is the most powerful car here but the lack of AWD hurt it in the dig
Easy 911 every day :-)
The Porsche no hesitation, to be precised i would want a GT3
sad how these guys are just comparing their ..... skills 😂 and ignoring the porsche which won everything
Lamborghini Aventador
Need to do the mclaren ferrari and Porsche
Team ferrari
Porsche Turbo S any day! Blue colour though :)
Definitely Porsche...
The real reason they brought the Porsche is to film the Lambo and Ferrari racing😂😂
I would have the ferrari 😍
I love it when Yanni loses 😝
Can't wait for the tesla roadster for the drag races🔥
Turbo S sounds like shit. Looks boring. Only 911 fans will turn heads. Good launch control tho. I'll give it that
*The Turbo S is like an innocent and cute looking woman that’s actually tough as hell.*
I would have porsche, porsche and porsche.
_I only saw two cars.....and a silver bullet._
Do a hyper car drag race
Ferrari
Suck it italians! porsche Powaaa
Definitely lambo's louder than others but Ferrari sounds better. And if I have to choose one of this I would choose Porsche 911 turbo s
Should have done the Italian accent with the Italian hand signs 😂
Porsche: "12 cylinders?... hold my beer...
After now watching a few of these and been on a Porsche experience driving day it has to be the Porsche 911 turbo S day in day out. Looks just aren’t everything what a piece of engineering
Porsche...
That’s it. I’m buying my third Porsche to celebrate!
lo bueno e importante empieza el 5:22 y lo realmente importante dura como 3 minutos en un video de 12 minutos  :(  :(
Turbo S for me thanks 😁😁😁
I would get the Porsche
I luv the 911; it’s cheaper, and faster. 👍🏾
That Porsche is bargain of the century 💯🙌🏼👏🏼
FERRARI 812 is my dream car
Lambo all the way !
Deutsches Auto Deutsche Power!!!
Hahhhaaa..... Yanni really hates losing...
All of them are much faster than sf1000 😂😂😂
Ferrari sounded best
Porsche
Yanni : ohhhh kom onnnnnn
Ppl keep camparing turbo car with Naturally aspirated NA car we all know who gonna win who is quicker consider less HP porsche did pretty good job but for rolling race porsche family never come on the top .. just because they build for dragrace
My man straight up jumped the line like no ones business
Always excited watching , your videos. For me if it’s not a GT-R it’s a Turbo S
Porsche just humiliating opponents!!
Porsche is so smooth 😆
“Because we know what the Porsche is all about”?  Lol, yep, All about real performance and punching above their weight. Typical Lambo fanboy. There’s a reason there are always a ton of Porsche’s and McLarens at the track and never Lambos. There for show
Give me the porsche AND the ferrari 😍
Porsche always always the Best!!!!
Porsche TurboS 991, Killercar 👍🏼. I Love this Car
Elfer all day
I would still have the SVJ because in the real world the limits of each car's performance cannot be truely explored..its not about fastest, its about what car makes you feel the most special..not to mention the sound of that big NA V12 is just priceless
Yesssss...Lambo won Ferrari...Porsche beat alla ya asses. What a legend!
lambo and Ferrari are all show and no go compared to the 911 lol and has rear seats!
I'd pick the Porsche every day of the week. And drive it every day of the week.
the porsche is like: are we done yet 🥱🥱
The Porsche has set the new ‘super car’ standard and is the most affordable and understated pinnacle of automotive engineering. Would love to witness the Porsche vs 720s!
PORSCHE!!!!
Ferrari won that sound test
Ma che bello sentire Mat parlare italiano🙃
The svj actually did better than I thought
LOL can we please talk about how that Porsche is winning those drag races so effortlessly 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I am a Ferrari fan, but that SVJ is just amazing. Lamborghini it is.
porsche didnt have to warm the tyres...wow
Porsche Porsche Porsche! Love it.
Porsche
How. I mean how a porsche with half of 12 cylinders can defeat its double. . Wowwwww.
Porsche, all day, every day!
Best videos on YouTube always.. Hands down.. Thanks you for providing us with this amazing content
„No replacement for displacement“ Porsche: I don’t think so
812 super fast
Can’t imagine what performance the new gt2rs will have. Will be in its own league for sure
Porsche...... you know.... another league when it comes to engineering masterpiece.  Cold tires, less hp, pretty heavy...
It’s eazy. I would get for sure the Porsche💪
This channel not interested in seeing inside the Porsche even though it's the fastest car here... Strange.
SVJ!!!🔥
SVJ 🚀🚀🚀 🔥🔥🔥
Lambo
Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari  Ferrari
Lamborghini 👍👌✌️👌
Oh my gosh Porsche.. ❤️❤️❤️❤️🥇🥇🥇🥇
Lambo sound more goog
Porsche!!!
Money is a big object and the Porsche is the best ;) also you better never mock other nations accent again and try to improve your driving skills so called “car journalist”
Love these vids with Yanni. Good banter with them
Der Porsche ist halt Deutsche Wertarbeit
Porsche 911
“Lambo All Day, Every Day!!!”
Look at the guy in porsche at 11:33.
I am going to say Porsche
I prefer the porsche!! Deutsche Wertarbeit. Herzliche Grüße aus Deutschland!!! ;-)
Porsche as they are more reliable and less likely to get keyed 😉
It’s all about the attention to detail.  If these cars were warplanes which one would you want pilot into battle?! Porsche’s engineering facilities it being a relatively reliable everyday car - this is something that the other two just can’t complete with without literally failing apart. I know. I own(ed) both. Children will love the verbose looks of the Italians but the Germans produced the better car.
That intro though 🤣🤣🤣
Thumbs up just for the intro, LOL
Porsche looks best to me
I love porsche
Porsche ist the best😍
Ferrari😍
Love the Porsche but the 812 super fast looks the best
Germans, what have you done
Porsche is the true super car
That Porsche is a bodybuilder in a business suit. I definitely love the Porsche
Porsche ❤️
proof that not always more expensive means better
Lamborghini Aventador svj
Considering the Porsche isn’t even the gt3rs or gt2rs is insane
This is some example of german engineering
Ferrari 812 is faster than the F1 Ferraris lmao
Ah cmon
Could someone explain me how that Porsche is quicker than others more expensive cars?
Top Porsche
It feels heavenly when Turbo kicks in Porsche, you can just feel it.
ferrari sound
Porsche and Ferrari look good.
Ferrari for me if they were all same price...911 in real world.
Someone needs to dyno that porshe, 650bhp my ring 😁
Ferrari
Marchentino
Personally I would have the Porsche 911 Turbo S. Best car out of the 3. Best looks, best performance (as you prooved), and a bit of sleeper look compared to the other two that is amazing!!
812
The perfect combination is Porsche gt2, Lambo, and Ferrari
🇩🇪 > 🇮🇹
Need P1 vs this Porsche now
Are we all going to ignore that both Yianni and Mat jumped drag race each plus Yianni again in the locked rolling...
Ferrari 812 for sure
I dont care if it lost im having that 812.
Porsche killed it....
Porsche 911 Turbo S, its quicker than the ferrari and lamborghini, but you can also drive it everyday and look conservative plus nobodys making it to 180-200 on actual roads
Porsche 😍
911 won the first race despite yani cheating yet again
@carwow for voting i guess there is 499 comment answer limit. Instead of that you can pin 3 comments you'll make for each option, and let people like it. Yeah more than 1 of them can be liked by single user, but it doesn't matter i believe.
Waouh ton accent⭐️⭐️⭐️
Porche 🧡
Man...what s wrong with the porsche...ha ha...always wins...it s another level..
La "PICCOLA" Porsche ha bastonato tutti....
I take a Porsche
Lambo cool 😎 👍👍👍👍
Porsche
El porsche es una maravilla  ni ferrari ni lamborghini ni pollas en vinagre jejeje viva porsche joder
Yianni dipping his head for the finish line was amazing
Money no object the heart says Lambo, but the brain still goes Porsche. Sorry Mat and the Ferrari. Found myself cheering Yanni on in the drag race 😅
Simply the German is NOT 650 hp. Germans just like to think so high of themselves.
Porsche rocks!
It’s Porsche not Porsch.
Yanni jumped the start in first one! Which would I have - still my Renault Espace and my Suzuki Hayabusa. Sorry :D
Well, the porsche does sound better.
Porsche all the way.
9:03 has yanni just come to a race with an empty tank? Petrol light is illuminating...
F12 superfast always
Deutschland über alle
Superfast for me...
Best intro i have ever seen 😂😂
Teslas sound the best
Do a drag race with a Bugatti chiron versus the porche 911 turbo s
Porsche in Another world ... 💪💪💪👍👍👍
SVJ hands down
Fantastic race, guys! Do you have any plans to get the Kenigsegg some time soon. I am sure it will be a most viewed  video on your channel.
Lambo sounded better💥💥 I would take the lambo  Lambo everyday anytime
Turbo S all the way, the actual real race car that can be daily driven
Ferrari
id much rather the lambo svj. my dream supercar. i wouldnt want anything else
Wait let’s not forget that the Porsche is not even considered a super car!
They should do 720s vs svj vs 812 super fast. Even tho we all know which would win, it would still be cool
Holly porsche all the way
*Sorry to say this.... But that Porsche need to be put on a Dyno...  The stated horsepower is underated and is more than it stated by Porsche....*
Jaja one of a kind supercar porsche its just it.......... lol the heaviest and the fastest lol
Z
Porsche
Ferrari
Porsche be like “hehe I a speedy VW beetle lol”
Porsche
Easy result....in drag 4wd win on rwd, turbo on na. Simply phisic.
Lamborghini cheated off the line 5:20 that race shouldn’t count
Ferrari and svj look really cool
that Porsche is mind blowing
Svj
Porsche or how u brits say PORSCHA RULZ!!!
911, everything time
Porsche all day, you cannot mistake a Porsche for any other car on the road
lamborginy
Lamborghini all day !!
ferari
Damn that porches beat the mclaren and this 2 I’m shocked
Germany makes the best cars 🔥
Svj
SF90 where you at son?! 😉👑
Svj
Porsche
Always Porsche
lambooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo................................................
I knew that p orsche was gonna win  like always the cheapest us always the better lol cheapest +mpg +tech top everything its just the best car company in the world fir making sport cars tha do everything with  the lowest percent of error
Svj 🔥
Lambo sound the best
The Porsche is about as exciting as a Tesla in these drag races; it doesn't really look or sound special but man can it do a 1/4 mile quickly 🤷‍♂️
Nobody can fuck with Porsche
Yiannie is so annoying it’s to the point where. It’s unbearable to watch i can not lie
Yanni has brighter teeth than my future. Probably he uses a Lamborghini toothbrush.
Normally I'd take a turbo S over just about anything except the 812. Both are blisteringly fast. Both are very comfortable, livable... turbo s is more so,  Yet 812 much more luxurious inside and much more fire outside. Forget svj... Only for track
Porsche. There is no substitute.
Great video, but i have to say my favorite part was the intro.
Does anybody knows why a Porsche is faster?
Drag race was much closer once Yianni didn't jump the start...
Matt: guess whos in the Lamborghini  Me: I hope it's no yiani frm Yianimize 🙄
I’d have the SVJ. Can’t beat the sound. Or the looks. Or the brutal launch control.
That Intro was spot on😁😁😁
Oh my god the sound of both Italian v12! magic!
Mathematically, 6 is more than 12. Technically, it looks different 😉
I would honestly have the SVJ, not because it’s a lambo, and because it’s fast but because of the sounds and it’s looks.
Porsche vs Dodge demon
pjp-exclusive.ucoz.net
bestcar.at.ua
I can't imagine the new monster 992 Porsche Gt3
Yanni jumps the start in every race 😂😂😂
The ferrari and the lamborghini are no match for the mighty Porsche.
911turbo s for sure..
The Porshe sounded better
The Ferrari sounds better, sounds quality
One can only wonder, what will be the first sub 10 second standing quarter mile 🤔 my money is on the Tesla Roadster when they eventually put that to the test!
This Porsche is on another level, half the price and it won't probably break down every 1k miles and u can use it as a daily driver too....!!!! Love Lambos and Ferraris but that Porsche is just big step ahead now - fact!!!!!
Porsche
I prefer the 812 superfast I think it looks sexy asf the svj looks more aggressive and sexy too but the curves on that Ferrari 🥴
The Porsche just waits in its corner to crush its opponents. No need for a show. Thats what i call a sleeper👍🏎️💨
DON’T TALK. RACE !!!!
FERRARI FOR ME
i would have to go with the 812, so beautiful 😍😍
SVJ please
If the Turbo S is quicker than the 720s from a stand still, why even try drag racing the 812 and SVJ lol
i would take the 911 over the svj or ferrari anyday. less money for better performance honestly
Ferrari for me please
Porsche ist deutsche Power ist Beste
Where is car which is less than 10sec
That Lamborghini sound got me feeling some type of way
imagine the upcoming gt2rs 🤯
fez for me
German precision
So, porsche wins with 120 less hp than the lambo. Wow!!! I just don't get why they don't apply this engineering to Audi... Because I love audi, but they aren't keeping up with amg or M anymore
you should of had the gt2rs instead
Porsche all day every day
911
The point of a supercar is to be obnoxious yall so I gotta go with the lambo haha, the other two are too classy.
Yanni , you jumped the starttt
Omg the Porsche 🔥🔥
The stereotype of italian accent though... ma che cazzo...
Porsche! 👌🏼💪🏼
All 3 cars are absolutely beautiful, my mind is between that Ferrari and the Lambo , if i had to choose 1 it we be the Lambo , sorry Matt..
Porche best looking
Why they still looking on ferrari or lambo? Porsche eat they all and going to mc Donald for snacks :D
The Porsche is a silent killer!!!  I'll take the Turbo S...any day!!
That Ferrari looked so fking sic, shud spend more time js looking at the cars.
No matter what the Results would´ve been, "the better car" for me would ALWAYS be the Porsche... ;DDD
Bugatti time?
People are really praising the porsche for getting a better drag time than the lambo even though the SVJ is the nurburgring lap record holder. Whats most impressive was the Ferrari, it kept up with the Porsche in the 1st rolling race and kept up with the Lambo in the drag.
I'd have the svj then porsche  then  812. Unless the 911 sounds like a v12 ferrari. Or if the 911 looked like the svj  and sounded like an svj or the ferrari 🤔
I don’t like sound of the Aventador, it’sounds louder but not as refined as the Ferrari. The best sounding V12 is still the Pagani Zonda !
Never seen a better PR. for buying a Porsche🤣😂
Porsche is unreal!!
Porsche :-)
I'll have the Porsche ALL DAY!! It may not  look as good as the other 2, but neither would wanna see me at a stop light
How many red bulls' did Yanni drink before this?
get a dodge demon on
5:01 Sounded like a Bosozoku!
Now it’s time to replace the Porsche with a McLaren 720s or even better a 765...
Ferrari any day💥
right when you get into the show...Commercial break!
SVJ
Fuck yeah! Turbo S is just a killer! My dream car!
Great video (again), great shots from the 'camera car' (again)
Anytime you see Porsche 911 tubro S in the title just know the Porsche taking the lead everytime.
Porsche.....the silent assassin
I don't care which one wins. I would take that Ferrari over the others any day. With that glorious V12, and that excellent styling.
Porsche
Hats off to Porsche
the Porsche wiped the floor with the Lambo and the Ferrari
812 and get a e85 tune here for the states I live in Nebraska and there’s 2 of them here and one of them is thinking about getting bigger cold air intake and a e85 tune, I just have a twin turbo Taurus 🤣🤦🏼‍♂️
Porsche 911 it's a great car in all conditions  even well price
911 dislikes for the 911
Flat 6 embarrassing anything it races against,,,, i gave up wen it embarassed mclaren 720s, that porche has literally taken over comment section lol
Porsche no questions.  Best car to live with on a day to day basis IMO.
I would have the Porsche for sure! Better/similar performance and half the cost. And it looks good while still being civilized. I would make it a bit louder though.
SVJ all the way😗💃💃💃🎉
Porsche...there is no substitute!
The Ferrari is the Nicer looking car
I'd have the Porsche, easily.
Ill have the 812 superfast plz💖
Porsche the best
The 812 sound so much better than the svj 🤐
Porsche Turbo S is the one ☝️
The Porsche will will still be doing this in thirty years...the Italian cars will be on their third engine rebuilds by then.
It's hilarious how they don't even acknowledge the Porsche, even though it BEASTED them costing 100k less😂😂
Id rather have an 812 superfast in orange
I would have the Porsche because you can use it every day
911 turbo
Porche
my choice is Porsche
Porsche is better. Engine, reliability etc. If you want a family car the panamera is the one. Lamborghinis are also nice since the are made by Audi BUT they are too bloody sensitive
Personally i would use the lambo for track the porsche for daily driving and the ferrari for long journeys
If you had the Ferrari in red, you would have won....
I’ll take the Porsche. 😉 😉
Silent, but deadly.
i would want the SVJ it also sounds better than the other cars
Porche
Just goes to show, one doesn’t need to spend all that money on performance cars.  The relatively cheapest car, the Porsche (still more than I could afford on a nurse’s salary), was clearly the better car in performance. Regarding what car had the better sound - in a neighborhood one could appreciate the lesser engine noise of the Porsche as the other two cars were clearly over compensating with noise as it couldn’t match Porsche’s performance. Still fun to watch the race though! Thanks for the entertainment!
911
I just lost my job because of the pandemic, so I started a YouTube channel about Motivation. Wish me luck!!!❤❤
Well strada is street
FERRARI  SOUND THE BEST
Bloody nut
Svj
Porsche. Job done
That Lamborghini sound though
Overprice cars getting beat by a Porsche that  cost way less than those 2 decorations.
Porsche ❤️💓❤️
911 all day long.
Porsche for the efficiency,  Lamborghini for the drama, Ferrari for the glory
812 superfast. Easy...
Porsche 911 turbo s was never in doubt the other two all mouth and no trousers
I prefer the Porsche because it looks really nice to me and I love the silver in it and plus it’s really fast for it’s size and plus it’s the cheapest
Men I love this porsche
Porsche
Wow that porshe is an amazing piece of engineering
765lt vs turbo s
Time to bring in the Senna
The Ferrari looks better tbf
Definitely the Porsche. The other 2 are too showey.
Made in Germany is the best
‘Rari
I would have the porche all day long
812 all day every day
Ferrari all day long.
911 turbo S
812 delete hehehe
SVJ all the way
You think 360 000£ is a lot for a car? Ferrari 812 costs 700 000€ and Lamborghini Aventador S roadster costs 730 000€ in Finland because of the astronomical taxes. Now THAT'S a lot of money.
The NA lambo and Ferrari actually did really good, a 10 second NA car would be unheard of 20 years ago
Best job ever 👌
That 812 looks insane and sounds a bit better than the lambo imo
yanni is a perect contrast for matt. I could watch them race cars all day.
The Porsche  is still reliable in any speed mode. 3 for 5.
The Porsche always build really great performance cars
Porsche ❤
They need to bring the F8
Lamborghini
Ferrari
The Lamborghini sounds better and looks way batter
But The 812 is not a supercar. It's a fast GT
I'd prefer to have the ( turbo s )...unlimited launch control!
Porsche 911 Turbo S is less in hp and less in cylinder and less in price and smoke theme
Ferrari any day mat
LAMBO SOUNDS THE BEST
Why would you have the Porsche over these two is beyond me
Matt needs to drive the lambo to understand
Porsche 100%
1milon% the ferrari
Lambo all day
Porsche is better but Lamborghini is an emotion.
Ads are killing this channel.....
Ferarri 812 looks awesome , so does the Lambo
Porsche ... Easy... Wait for a königsegg regera
Porsche for the W
That Porsche is serious business man, its really just like a masterpiece or something
So Yanni jumped the start in race 1, Matt jumped it in race 2.  That Porsche is absurd, it wins everything every time.  Porsche just make it look like your rs3 with vents and colors, make the exhaust loud, and Yanni and Matt can’t make any negative comments... ever!  Hail the Porsche!!
2 shouting Italians go to a bar for a drag.  Porsche: "Can you hold my beer just for one sec, babe!"
911 King again, going to take something really quick to top that car, unbelievable performance 👀
that lambo sounds loke a superbike
lamborghini
Porsche 911 Turbo S All The WAY!!!👍
That ferrary looks better than that lambo
The hats are for improved aerodynamics. everyone knows that
You gotta appreciate the 911
Porche for the 0to60s and the ferrari for the roll races. The lambo is the medium of the 2
Lamborghini NA v12 SVJ, and the Nürnberg ring record holder for production cars😉
If you would buy the Porsche it means you’re not a car person, period
the cars represented their countries incredibly well.....two shouty italians and a quite and efficient german just winning.
Lambo all the way
Porsche Turbo S:  all the car you’ll ever need to hang with just about anything.
Ferrari by a mile
the 812
Lambo :)
That Porsche is fucking mental
Great video.  I have a 2015 Turbo S that’s making 625HP at the wheels and 675 ft/lbs of torque.  Police don’t even look at it twice.
Lamborghini aventador svj 63 Lamborghini aventador svj 63 Lamborghini aventador svj 63 Lamborghini aventador svj 63 Lamborghini aventador svj 63 Lamborghini aventador svj 63 Lamborghini aventador svj 63 Lamborghini aventador svj 63
Does anyone know what Yani does for a living lol
Porsche the best !
Porsche amazes me Everytime that I watch any video of its cars. No wonder snubs in their Italian cars try to ignore Porsche by saying it isn't a hypercard. Your Lambo isn't a super car either if its performance can't be better than a car less than half of your car's price
911 is most flexible, Best looking, timeless car on earth. It does not sound - it does the job like hitman.
It has to be the Porsche, its a mean machine yet simple looking.
Porsche 911 turbo s for looks by a mile...class is always permanent
It is not called Porsh! Porscheeeeeeeeee!
But nobody buys a lambo for speed they buy it to flex, speed is a bonus
Well i have Tinitus, so i go for the Porsche 😁, and its the best car. Ferrari got bad electronic.
if Porsche>>> +100Hp ????
Porsche hands down
porsha
Ferrari
Porsche
The Porsche amazes me. It’s not that impressive if you race it against cars that are known to be slower but racing against 2 V12 powerhouses and winning with a flat 6cyl 3.8 liter engine
Lamborghini SVJ to the win!
What were you oaks saying about the sound of the Turbo S. All that noise and money for WHAT Porsche is 👑
most epic launch in youtube history.  hats off to yianni
The 911 Turbo S NO QUESTION!!
Porsche 911 Turbo S is a much batter car then the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ and half of the price as well ( overall less money to pay for a good car )
Why did he say the lambo doesn’t have dual clutch shifters?
When are we starting to talk about Yanni jumping the start at every drag race?
C'mon a drone would have shot beter shots than 3 Go Pro Cameras.
911 turbo S....looks so sensible and hammers the other two quietly...
Porsche 911
AWD, PDK and torque...no brainer who would win here. Lambo sounded the best too.
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ for me
812 no doubt!!!🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎
Lambs every day
Surely it has to be the 911, 365 days a year
911, boosted>NA
Lambo sounded best
yianni #kingofjumpstarts
the Porsche 100%
Porches 911 has been my favorite car for a while now mainly cuz of looks I didn’t even know it was dat fast jeeezz
Ferrari!
the 911.
Porsche :)
Porsche shows how much overpriced are all other supercars
Porsche
Hi uncle
Porsche and save the money and grace!
VOTE: Turbo S......what you need with a supercar is reliability. Wide boy fezza and Lambo are for old mugs.
For sure the porsche 911 turbo S is my pick !!
The Porsche sounds better
Damn I love Porsche’s so much!
Doesn’t matter the fastest (0.1s we are talking about), the most fun to drive has always been Ferrari! E.g. why only has rear wheel drive :) don’t think they couldn’t add it
Se parli ancora così smetto di seguire sta cagata di canale
Porsche is the best car manufacturer in the world but Ill have the ferrari.
I'd take the Porsche... atleast I know I wont be disrespected by Supped up Audi S3s
This is why I love Ferrari’s
Ferrari Ferrari Ferrari Ferrari Ferrari  Ferrari (SORRY YIANNY) Ferrari Ferrari Ferrari Ferrari Ferrari Ferrari Ferrari
well the turboS is a kind of Jason Statham in a suit smashing pumped up thugs in a bar...
Sorry Matt... I would have the lambo SVJ even tho the Porsche is quicker
Yanni looks like he's strangling the steering wheel.
Win prosche
The Porsche is great, but I'd get the 812 Superfast.
Ferrari all the way... looks amazing. But, that Porsche is unreal, wtf is this car
Lambo totally jumped the first race
Hey people , just a quick question  If you had 50k what car would you buy ?
Porsche baby.. Porsche..😍😍
Porsche is the perfection
Na vs turbo 4x4 ..Ferrari the best
ferrari
“ Porsche... There is NO SUBSTITUTE. “ - Risky Business / Tom Cruise 1983
Only Porsche! Always! Forever!
The ferrari sounds better honestly. The lambo is just louder
Best intro ever haha😂
Deutschland uber alles, and I ain't even german lol
porsche hands down
Porsche always has to make it clear who is the boss
Porche the whole way. Carwow has made me fall in love with that beast of a car. Thank Matt.  Between the rari and lambo I’m definitely taking that lambo mate 😂
Gt2rs?
PORSCHE!!!! NOTHING COMES BEFORE...
this was definitely one of the best sounding drag races
Porsche all the Way!!!
Umm I’d pick the Ferrari then Porsche then the svj
Imagine an flat8 engine, 😶
I can use my.ford gt 2019 againat those 3 will lose
SVJ
I dont trust that Porsche
I literally subscribed bc of the tire pressure warnings
Porsche is still produce the best Cars in the world
Lambo: I’m the best looking. Ferrari: I’m a Ferrari. Porsche: I’m a bit of a bore
7:50 but it on lowest play speed, Mat cheated?
Of these three cars, I would definitely get the Porsche - it's a better performer than the Italians, is more practical, and is WAY cheaper.  However, I would order it in Carmine Red - there are way too many silver Porsches in this world. I just hope I can fit into it - I'm 6'4" tall.
If I practically consider every constraint, I'm into PORCHE more
Lambo
812 is goals
4,44
Best looking: 812 Superfast Best sounding: SVJ Best overall: 911
I would love the Porsche 911 anytime
The Porsche is insane!
Ain’t no damn way that Porsche sound like that
Porche
svj then superfast
Porsche all day long
The German accent do
There is only one option....... 911
Ferrari NO doubt!!
1.Porsche 2. 812 3. svj
Imagine jump starting and still losing.
damn,  listening to the Ferrari: Yeah, that sounds good.... Yanni revs the Lambo: shit, that is on another level!!!
SVJ
I would definitely prefer the Porsche 911 Turbo S.  It is a better performer than either of the Italians, is more practical, and is WAY cheaper.  However, I would get it in Carmine Red rather than the ubiquitous silver.  I just hope I can fit into it - I'm 6'4" tall.
Just imagine if that Lambo had a Dual Clutch...
The accents where pretty good Matt!
Porsche   -    MADE IN GERMANY !!!
Porche all day
Silver cars are usually quicker than the rest. Advantageous to Porsche
Porsche 911 turbo is the real beast 🔥
And guys, keep in mind: porsche still got the gt2rs up their sleeves......
Porsche!
POOORSCHE FOR LIFE M8
THE Porsche sounds the best just like my Dyson.
Deutsche wertarbeit😋ach ja Lamborghini und trainingshosen geht gar nicht
Porsche: "12 Cylinders? I only need half of them and half the price to rip you in pieces."
If I could have one I would take the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, because im a Lambo lover. :)
How can Porsche make such an awesome performer and fail so misarably on the exhaust sound?! I don't get it. It's not like they had couple of years to make it. It's been an issue for years
Ferrari 812 best looking
I would want any of these, but if it was my money, and my only supercar - Porsche all the way. It's nice to be driving instead of car being in the shop
The Turbo S is out of this world. Money no object, I’d have the 812 (despite the little gremlins).
Ferrari
Lambo
Not good enough Mr Italian🤪👍
7:39 lol. That made the SVJ win that time.
Ok we know 911's are brutal in 1/4 mile and 0-60, but why is nobody talking how Ferrari which is RWD with 800hp can put all that power to the ground with no wheelspin and almost beat the Lambo. That's way more impressive to me!
Porsche of course.
Mocking the Porsche and yet both of you got owned, lame
That porsche wtf.....
Porsche
No doubts - I'd always choose Porsche
Porsche is just unbelievable
whoever pais an extra £100k to get beaten by the Porsche needs their head looked at.
Lamborghini All the way...
How Porsche is faster? 😂😂
If money no object i still pick the Porsche! Only a Turbo S can embarrass a much more expensive and faster car.    But it's still comfortable to drive daily, also looks still exotic but not intimidating, even if parked with a VW Beetle.
svj
911 turbo s just embarrasses everything it lines up against lol
I love it when Yanny is on the channel!
Ferrari F1000 Super GP2 SVJ
Ferrari happy you didn't die
Here just to see Yianni make Saturday aggressive!
Porsche but my son wants the gt2 Porsche
TURBO S for me, thank you.
The Porsche sounds like a vacuum cleaner
I’d rather have the Porsche honestly!
Каааааак ПП ПОРШ ЕДЕТ ТАК?????????????
Bella prova ma bisogna migliorare quella specie di italiano. Like se sei un italiano e hai appena letto questo commento
11:59 Tbh, I like the looks of the ferrari waaaaay better than the lambo.
Everybody bragging about porsche winning but this is only quarter mile race let’s be honest no one is goona race like that in real life is what rolling race is and McLaren 720s is the real king it can beat these three cars!
812 superfast on looks alone.. Lamborghini is becoming.. dare I say it.. boring.. at least Ferrari have a variety of differently styled cars and completely different body shapes in their line up..
Only the Porsche is a car! The others are crap crazy expensive toys!
Lambo jumped and still got spanked by porsche !
Porsche 911 Turbo has always been my favorite car since the beginning of NFS til today and these drag races just keep making me love it more and more Can't wait to own one
Porsche 911 turbo s
That Porsche is just ridiculous
Ferrari sounds better for sure
VW is killing it!
I want the porsche. Porsche looking great!
I love the German car all day long, then the ferrari and lastly the Lamborghini 👎
I’ll have the Ferrari... sell it, buy the Turbo S and live happy with the Porsche & £100,000 in the bank ☺️
Ferrari in yellow all day
That Porsche is f*****g insane
PORSCHE is the best 👏👏👏🙌
I would chose the 812, because that’s my dream car 😳
Deutsche Technik !!
Can we see a 9 second car?
I think yianni should start wearing hats like that it looks really good on him also makes him look younger . No Homo 👌👍👍
I think the ferrari is a beast in the top end
do a quarter mile with the 2020 shelby gt500 please :(
Porche all the way...everyday..
That 911 is that unassuming girl that you’d never admit to your boys is the best lay you’ve ever had
God I love that Porsche :-D
The best revving came from the walkie talkie
FOR FREE?? I would get the lambo for higher resale value. =)
Офигенная заруба,парни!
812 winner
honestly i kinda like the 812 more then the SVJ!
911 Porsche turbos
Since I was a kid, I loved Ferrari and it's still my favorite car manufacturer. Second place would be Porsche. Out of all the 3 in the video, Ferrari is the only car manufacturer that actually changes the look of the car. The other two don't (Lamborghini and Porsche always look the same, regardless of the model). Is the Ferrari better looking out of the 3? No... for me the Porsche is the prettiest.
Porsche best car, but would have the Lambo, and yes Yanni it’s the best looking!
Somebody dials 911
Porsche everyday
Walter
Finally we’ve got the SVJ guys🥳🥳🥳... Mat since we know the huracan performante is quicker than the SV, plz try to get the same purple huracan to run against this SVJ 😏 in the name of since 😉
Would get the porshe without a doubt! German solid engeneering, not Italian soft spaghetti
911 turbo S by far
The Superfast looks and sounds best
Porsche really know how to make a good car. In that respect its not hard to see why i think they are the car world kings
That Ferrari 812 supefast is amazing so cool 😎🤘
Ferrari
Drag race the Ferrari 812 against the Aston Martin DBS and another V12 GT car.
Ofco Porsche!!!!!
I love it when Yainni pops up in carwow. The guest appearance is always welcome. Great video guys. I’m writing this before I even finish watch the video. Cause I know it’s a great one!. 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Porsche...heavier, less HP, less torque, cheaper...Porche wins the race :) German quality :)
Mat Watson:-My Ferrari 812 will defeat your Lambo Yiannimize:- Mine Lambo Will defeat your Ferrari  PORSCHE:- Wait A Second I will defeat you BOTH!!!
Can I help you sir? 1  Porsche pls!!  But the Lambo or Ferrari are way more beautifull !!  NO THEY ARE NOT!!
I would pick the 911 Turbo S Any day for its performance, usability, heritage, and the fact I have been in love with the 911 since I was 4 years old!
Lamborghini Aventador svj ❤️
Lamborghini obvious
911 Turbo S
I want the Porsche, good car for your money
I would rather have the Porsche because I could just about almost pray that I might be able to fix it. But that of course means only being able to have a flat tire fix. 😂
Matt always lacks in reaction time off the line
I like the porsche more
lamborghini svj
A 812 Superfast
Lambo
Porsche 911 Turbo S for sure
Damn those Porsche alien engineers ruining shaming earthlings..
Porsche is just beyond limits....
911 is a real legend. But I prefer to drive and own a 812 ferrari superfast. Best engine s sound is Aventador SVj.
Definitely I will have a Porsche 911
Porsche and Ferrari I my favorite brand owning many cars and driving many cars showed my love for them especially Porsche the drive capability is beyond amazing
Porsche mate all day every day
GERMAN ENGINEERING🤩🤩🤩
Can you please put the text for US units pretty please
I'd bet on the p911ts
the svj is soo loud that you can't hear the farrari at all in the race.
765lt vs turbo s？
Will someone explain to Mat that the e in Porsche isn’t silent? Please and thanks.
The Porsche is the best on the track, the Ferrari is the best on the road, and the Lambo is the best as a bedroom wall poster.
Could u do a huracan performente and SVJ drag? I need to know which ones faster😖
Not even close. TURBO S all day
Porsche is impressive off the line, also sounds like a raging vacuum cleaner and looks very ordinary in comparison, inside out.
Time to bring a 765lt
I would buy a 911 and a tycan for the price of the lambo
It’s a flat six, a FLAT SIX!!! and he shreds those w12s like a joke. That’s it I am getting a Porsche.
putting the 63 stickers on a not 63 is pretty pathetic tbh
Porsche any given day!!
So much respect for that porsche  just wow
The understated (in this company anyway!) porsche is the all round best daily supercar.
We need more Turbo S videos, its baffling how quick it is, but hard to find any videos of it
Overall I’m taking the Porsche, but on looks I’m going Ferrari because that shit looks MEAN
Porsche 🔥 It's a complete sleeper car now  Looks elegant and performs like a supercar
The porsche is fast but so boring 😭😭😭 lambo and Ferrari are amazing 😍
Porsche
I would have the Porsche, better all rounder!! Sorry Yianni.
lambo sounds the best
Tesla S does the 1/4 mile in silence at 10.3seconds.
11:33 The Porsche driver looking out like some serial killer :D
Will Yanni grow up when he’s 50?
Sound the Ferrari, which would I have? The Porsche.
Aventador SVJ
I really would like to see a viper review
Firstly it is not a POOOORSCH, it is a PorschE. Secondly, you could have had the courtesy to properly introduce the Porsche driver as well, even more in light of the fact this car was seriously the real champion! Performance and torque obviously beat sound!
The people at Porsche are literally the masters of car engineering, ya
"Killed the ferrari tho" dude you literally had an early start
The 812 for sure!!
What will take down that 911?
McLaren 720S 😢
Yanni cheated he hit 1st before a go
Lets be wize! No one ever will push this mosters to their limits in real world and ther limit are not that diffrent! So only thing does matter is wich one make u feel better! I fell better with svj it has the best look by miles! It souns better! And its auch a head terner! So its an easy choice for me
2 of the dogs are barking while the other one is biting.
Porsche sounds like a UPS delivery truck. Haha
Money no object, I would take 812 Superfast. Not a hard decision for me.
i really love your vids. gj ma men. but pls could you pronounce "porsche" like we german do ?you speak the "e". its not " porsh". thx for that :) greetings
Porsche The best!😁
Made in Germany😁
Svj
Wait until lambos upgrade the dual clutch
The Camera man is inside the PORSCHE 😬🥺🤭
Porsche looks the best
They should disqualify the Porsche for being too good.
PLEASE REVIEW THE 812SUPERFAST
The 911 is beautiful 😍😍😍
For me i will go with the 911 turbo S. That car i have to buy it
Give me a 720s any day, should have had one in this race.
Ferrari all black yes to own
911
Porsche turbo
Guys can we just quickly acknowledge that the Porsche is a bloody beast...
A sound comparison between a V12 lamborghini and a V12 Ferrari. Lamborghini loses that battle every day of the week.  Actually it's the worst sounding V12 ever manufactured. Ferrari wins that sound comparison.  And of course the Ferrari is going to lose from a dig.  And if I had to choose between all of them in money was no object I would choose the Ferrari.
812sf 🧨🔥🔥
What a piece of trash the Lambo is, as always... 3x more than the Porsche but not even a 1/4 the car... but being just a V6, if you’ve got the money, the 812 was sue superior... 0.2 in a standing quarter mile given Porsche’s 4-wheel drive is not enough...
The only reason Yanni did so well the first race is he jumped the start by some way. Which shows how fast the porsche is
911 for ME
I would 100% get the Porsche, just looks the best.
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE PORCHE 911 turbo s
812
Yani: come on come on,, oh no oh no 😂😂😂
Why did you even include porsche 😂😂🤣😂 it just destroyed supercars with 800hp and 770hp with 6l v12 engines respectively 🤣🤣😆🤣😆🤣😆😆🤣🤣😆
Porsche
911 for moi
And still... Ferrari wins my choice
Porsche of course!!! ❤️❤️
The porsche beat the V12 cars🤣🚶‍♂️
Lambo😘
Y’all should do a superfast and a tdf!!
Naah Matt, this dragrace was all about the flimsy STUTTGARTian. Just insane.
Im not a fanatic porsche, but that was amazing... 🔥🔥🔥 I rather choose the Ferrari anyways, another amazing thing in this vid... Mat Watson showing it to us 👍🤘💪
This race was amazing, different setting somehow
P O R S C H E
Naaah his Lamborghini sound is shit compared to the 812 superfast
We all knew who was gonna win this. They knew it too, everyone knew.
I already own the 992 TTS.  So I’m a bit bias . I want to see a 720s vs the 992 TTS
And the Porsche won even without a driver 🤷‍♂️
It took u to go 180MPH to even catch da porche :|
The ferrari sounds way better than the lambo
wtf is that porche  i mean fucking fast
JESUS Loves YOU ALL. JESUS died for the sins of everyone. JESUS went to hell for ALL of US and after 3 days JESUS rose from the dead to give eternal life to everyone who will believe and follow JESUS to the END. (John 3:15-17/1st Corinthians 15:1-4 NKJV)
Bollocks....lol I'll take the Porsche please
This is just the turbos. Imagine the sheer speed of the 992 generation GT2 and GT3 911 cars that will come. Even the 991s are stupid fast. Porsche is the best for performance no doubt and overall probably the best drivers car. With that said give me an NA V12 812.
porsche ❤️❤️❤️❤️😇
Porsche all the wayyy!!
I’m shocked. Didn’t think the Porsche would stand a chance at all but wow. For a 1/3 of the price that is definitely the car I’d go for!
Mat: Can we guess who is in the Lamborghini? Me: Yanni Last video: Had a Lamborghini not driven by Yanni
4:18 Gone to get my HEARING AID!
SVJ all day💪🤷‍♂️ no offend👍
Svj all the way
PORSCHE 👍👍💔
Este ñoño siempre pierde... 😂😂😂😛
812 and 911 only
no one: yanni:come on!!!!!!!!!! i like how he says ut and he's face:)))))
no one: yanni:come on!!!!!!!!!! i like how he says ut and he's face:)))))
The driver in the Porsche had to be a race driver, its not possibel that the Porsche wins😂
Porsche is the best, period!!!
I watched this twice just to watch Yianni lose to the Porsche
Porsche 911 Turbo S 🔥🔥🔥
I like your style of chaning ackent of talking keep it up 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Porsche! all day, everyday..
I'd have a Porsche, anyday! Porsche rules 🤩
The porche is mental beating the italien cars woooow
Porsche
Lamborghinis are good off the line but not as fast once u get u to speed
Posche on fire
Italians beaten by germans. Porsche is the best.
Well if I had lambo money to spend on a car id get that Ferrari, same spec.
992 turbo s😍
I bet the 720s has a chance in beating the turbo s
Porsche
Svj
Svj is a beast, come on👌🏽🙏🏽
Which car would I have ? thats easy the 911 a day long!!!
I like the way the Ferrari sounds
992
I'd have the Ferrari in terms of looks
I can't even imagine not having those videos popping up. Thanks Matt for this great job and keep it up.
Porsche
Porsche
That Porsche it's just insanely fast, Ferrari it's Ferrari!!! and the Lamborghini it really is a great peace of engineering!
Ferrari sounds better
Get Lord Aleem and Yianni in a video, that would be so sick.
The Porsche is like an adult watching kids play, knowing very well it's better than both of them
Dude the Porsche is incredible
What makes the MAGIC of the PORSCHE is the Transmission (how power is delivered)
The accents were spot on mate!🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lambo is for cocks, ferrari is for rich old people and porsche is for connoisseurs
Porsche
SVJ Jumped the shit out of  the first race
I would have the Porsche no doubt about it
Put a demon gainst that porshe pls
The Ferrari is a gt car
I would get the lambo, sell it and get the porsched and use the rest of the money for the prosche insurance and gas
How come you never do drags with maserati
SVJ is garbage. Half-track version of the Aventador S, suffers from the standard version of the 812. Imagine race with 812 half-track.
Best Porsche 😎👍
Yianni always jumps start haha too competitive, you see it in his eyes XD
I like how the Porsche just casually crushes these cars without warning up its tires, being loud, costing as much, or even looking as “mean” as these cars
The Porsche 911 Turbo S  is an Amazing car!!
If you think that 156.000 pounds it's expensive for a 911 Turbo S, just notice that a 911 Turbo S in Argentina costs about 700.000 dolars...
In reality  Ferrari 812 , dry weight 1525kg, weight in running order 1630kg. Not 1744kg !!!!!!
Lambo
svj
Those different accents hahaha LMAO 😂😂
Ferrari ❤
Porsche sounds best - Tesla sounds even better ^^
Svj all the Way
I would take the 911 all day!!!!!!
The porshe is a hacker
I’d have the SVJ but the 812 is my second fav car
Lamborghini forever
Porsche like a Ninja, silence killer.
A Porsche will always destroy any other car 🙅‍♂️ it is the best built car period.
Wow that lambo is just pure stupidity for the price
That porsche is A STEAL for that pricetag considering its performance.
Yianni is on fire as always :-D :-D :-D Medals to 992 Turbo S! Luv it
Race the SVJ against a 488 pista or a 720s  also why hasn't anyone raced an f8 yet?
Pls Do More Videos With The SVJ
That porshe is unbelievable... 👏🏼
I’m taking the 911 any day of the week. It’s been my favorite car since childhood
I would still have the Lambo
Ferrari looks the best
Porsche 911 turbo s
Porsche all day... lol
It makes me wonder if they use the 20-second extra boost on the Porsche ?
Well, at least they were honest about the YouTube money and dying for views 😂
porsche is fucking beast mode
Svj all day out of these 3
I don’t know why but I’d never have a Lamborghini. They look nice and that’s about it. Out of all the Supercars I’d have a Ferrari hands down all day every day. I think just for the heritage reasons.
Your Italian is really bad mate lol
Porsche is just insane considering you can put 4 of your friends in it and do a drag race
Porsche.... is the fastest the most reliable the less expensive supercar the most efficient and the best looking ever made even if it has the aerodynamics of Peugeot 404  ..... you should learn this... international BHP has 4 legs.. Porsche's one has 5
Porsche steage 1
Can u do the 918 spider vs 911 turbo a vs an egg
lambo
Porsche all day long
812 > SVJ any day
812 is the better of course
In the video you can see Yarni reaction time is quicker than Mats I think Ferrari should be handed to Yarni to see what time he can get out of it????
I just placed an order for the 992 turbo s... but I still would take the 812 if money wasn’t an object
mclaren P1
I will take porshe
5:22 Yanni going on 1 .... Jump start much .
Big surprise the awds won a drag race
I don’t think it’s very fair to compare cars which have 100-200 k difference in them. A 360k Porsche would completely outperform them by a much larger margin
I can't have any of them Matt😀
I am telling you porsche's are underrated!
Porsche 911 is just magic
SVJ
Lambo is beast😍😎
Lambo jump started
I love how Porsche just buggers off and lets Italians keep arguing about who's the best!
The Porsche is awesome, and for that price, I’ll get that and a nice house and still drive away and leave both of those much more expensive cars.
You should put all the stats above the cars so we could see the diffrence before the race
Tbh I’d have that odd grey thing in the distance because it’s cheaper and faster than the show off pricks
Porche
Tbh this is one of the best lineups I’ve ever seen
I will have the porsche
Porsche 1 then Ferrari 2 and then Lamborghini
Make a vedeo of F12 TDF vs Aventador SVJ 😀
Love the show.  Porsche all day long
Just wait for the new Porsche GT2 RS to come out 🤯. Better aero, lighter, more power. Lamborghini brought out their big boy n so did Ferrari n yet Porsche brought out their second fastest car. GT2 RS is coming😈
we deserve to see Yanni and Matt to do a foot race
i like the spec on that lambo very cool looking
King of drag race porsche ❤️
Man that porsche is wicked ❤️ love that legend killer
svj
Even cheating Yanni couldn't win.. douche...
Porsche
The Lamborghini won the sound test. It shot fire in the process. Lamborghini all day - everyday.
Porsche won the rev off too lol
SVJ
Porsche 911 turbo s
Ferrari and lambo talk the talk porshe do tae walk
Always been a porsche fan!!!!!
Ferrari exterior, lambo sound, Porsche interior and performance
Lambo all the time ❤️
The Porsche
Porsche 911 turbo s all day every day...🕊😷
Porsche just doing its thing agains those monsters just makes it so fkin cool
I will take the lambogini
Well done Porsche ❤❤❤
This was a real fun test. I love how that Porch is so capable, if I was to own one of them though I might take the SVJ, it has so much character and performance.
So ...it's not only in the F1 that Ferrari is making great steps BACK ...
Would surely like to see what happens on a race between 911 turbo s and 918
This Porsche is just so fast that it is not even an interesting watch anymore.
812 still sounds beautiful. Yianni's not a bad loser, is he??
I got so pissed when I saw the Porsche go by. Man that Lambo👌🏼
The porche
A great race in quite some time... The Lambo did very well. The Ferrari's top end is awesome. The Turbo S killed the quarter mile record as always.
Just imagine Porsche with those power numbers.
10:27 - the moment you open the door of a Ferrari which is not yours with your foot 🤦🏻‍♂️
Would rather have the Ferrari out of all of them,just a better looking car ,if I had to drive to work everyday,I'll take the Porsche
wish this video reaches 1.000.000 views!!! currenty as watching is 945.400....Go for it and smash the 👍 button...
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ definitely looks the best🏎💨
What Posrche? xD I would pick the Porsche among the others. To be honest, I'm fan of the brand.
For sure the svj
That Porsche is a silent killer. Damn
Ferrari!
The Porsche's exhaust sounds the best, yes, I'm mad.
Yanni gets SO fired up when he races 😂
The Lambo looks like a kit car
The lambo actually did better than I expected
Love Ferrari, but WOW that Porsche is SUPREME...!!!
Ofc ferrari
German engineering at it's finest.
7:40 😂
Please the 812's review!!!
That Porsche! 👌🏻👌🏻
I’ve seen that svj round Cardiff one of the only supercars in the city 😂
Porsche its just the most amazing machine ever build
My neighbors think the Porsche sounds the best 👎🏼
1. 812  2. Porsche 3. SVJ
@5:06 his face=priceless 😂🤣😂🤣😂 Hoonigan😂🤣😂🤣
Porsche, ferrari then lambo although it did sound the best.
ferrari anytime
In terms of sheer fun, visibility and comfortableness 812 all the way but for the safety I would definitely choose Porche. Man those brakes are 💪
812 & SVJ  both jumped the start and Porsche jumped the finished line first 😂
Which prancing horse was better    If you said Porsche 911 turbo S  3.8L straight six  twin turbo   If you said this you’re write     If you said that the other thing was better you need glasses and you’re probably high so  Understandable have a great day ✌🏻
Turvo for acceleration and NA to hig speeds.
Crazy that u can pretty much buy an 812 and a 911 for close to the same price as the svj. Lamborghini dropped the ball on this svj. How does it not have dual clutch transmission? It’s absurd.
Never have been exited more about a race then this
The Porsche. Nuf said! I love it!!!
I´d take the 911 Turbo and use the rest of the money driving around the world with it for 2 years.
812
Porsche is unbelievable
Svj as the most beautiful sound ever
812 superrrrfastt
812
Porsche, closely followed by Ferrari, even Yianni's cheating couldn't  beat it. Could buy a GT3 RS as well.for the price of that Lambo
Lambo
The only car I've seen beat the 911 turbo s is a hypercar. Nothing else has a chance
812 superfast are you mad
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Nice voice
Da rada sensible 911 turboyaaaaa😂😂😂😂
lambo might be loud but ferrari sounds much better...
What is sometimes happening to the audio??!! 🤔☹️🙁😡
Aventador SVJ
If money was no object I would most definitely have the porche
Hey mat 😁😁 u just made me laugh man lol
812 sounds best no questions asked
Who else loves to see yianni in carwow videos? Matt and yianni are the perfect duo
Porsche for me
1/2 mile ?
Porche by far, others are too much fancy
The PDK in the Porsche is just leaps and bounds better than the other transmissions
Porsche is super understated for the amount of power it produces
3:33 to skip all the intro crap
911 Turbo S for me.
Porsche 'cause that's the best car for all situations and you have no curb problems :D
lamborganhi
No speak inglish can put speak spanish
I'm sorry but if I was to buy any of these three, I'd get the Porsche, but without road-testing either of the other two. Because I'd know that just by touching the loud pedal on that Lambo I'd forget about everything else and drive it home.
Let’s be REAL! SVJ all day. It’s the quintessential super car on looks, sounds and after dealing with shit all your life to make it to the top, it’s the ultimate FU car. Ferrari doesn’t do that, it’s just a fast GT. Neither does the Porsche (fast, but not a FU car).
Get through,  get through 🤣🤣🤣
The Ferrari looks the best.
Porsche 911 turbo S
YEAAAAAAA POOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORSCHE 😍❤😍😍❤😍😍❤😍❤
4:37:  Carwow: "Everyone decide below which one sounded the best." Tesla driver: " The Porsche...? "
My favorite is the Aventador, but I’m going Superfast.
Matt: The 911 turbo s is the fastest car so far on this channel     Bugatti: Am I a joke to you?
Ferrari
Svj
Ferrari
Ferrari
That porsche is unreal
I will always take the Ferrari, next video you need to race all three on a 5 lap track race.
Porsche all the way ❤️
We need a Bugatti vs the 992 turbo s cuz this car is just crazy fast
Bring out the Mclaren Senna! Vs Porsche Turbo S please
Those V12’s sound amazing.
i would have the ferrari A12 super fast because it looks cool
I love Lamborghini
use the fucking mclaren 720s
Lambo perfromante vs 911 turbo s
Ferrari
How about a FORD V FERRARI next!!!
is that a german accent
ferrari soundddd
Geez Mat, you're always a ass-dragger off the lie. You need to spend a month at the Pomona Drag Strip, mate!
So in a roll race the 812 superfast would beat a 720s?
This Porsche is on another level.
Matt, your dutch accent is so good 😂😂😂
Ferrari: best interior  Lambo : best exterior  Porsche : best performance  .
Porsche is a monster.   It's amazing how a car that's more than half price, half engine size and +100 hps less hps can kill those other two cars, it's not just 4 wheel drive or weight, as we can see from the result.  911 is a beast, probably won't ever be beaten.
Porsche all day long
Ferrari wins the looks
German vs 2 big boys from Italy and still porsche trashed both of them.... one life, one car - #PORSCHE 🔥💯❤
Porsche then Ferrari
Lambo jumped early on the 1st race
Ferarri
Either the rarri or the porsche
Is this the first time we've seen the starter up close? I've always been curious.
Turbo S - Best performing and best daily SVJ - loudest and angriest 812 - best sounding (subject to opinion) and best looking
Porsche 100%
Porsche!!
I’d take any of the three. They are all great and unique in their own ways.
Out of the 3 I’m going for the Ferrari and it’s mighty V12 all day 🚀
SVJ ❤️❤️
Ha Ha Ha that poor cheap Porsche has eaten 2 monstrous ugly and expensive lambo Svj and humiliated the Ferrari heavily and deeply what a shocking display.  I was always a Ferrari fanboy but after seeing this video I can't handle the humiliation 😂🤣
I will take the Porsche
Absolutely Ferarri, then the Lambo.. then the Porsche just cause it looks so bland!
Matt- I've totaly disgraced Ferrari with that. SBINOTTO-  T_T
Id have the lamborghini sorry 😂😂
Meanwhile in the Porsche, the 2 kids at the back asking his dad and mum at front, "Dad why is the Lambo and Ferrari following us?"..lol
I'd have a Porsche any day of the week without question
Porsche is king! It is the best looking among the three  and the fastest in a 1/4 mile
I’d take the Porsche, pure performance and I can drive it every day
!!!  PORSCHE !!!!
I take Lamborghini Aventador SVJ😂😂😂
The 911 is the best Supercar at the Moment ☝🏻
Well when is the nurburgring test coming because the svj is the fastest production car ON the nurburgring
Time to test this car https://www.motortrend.com/news/hennessey-tuned-jeep-trackhawk-makes-1200-hp/
Hahahahahhaha the intro was epic
Porsche is the ultimate quality. We have to agree. Porsche proves what it does.
Porsche...somehow simply better 😏
Hahaha... Mighty Porsche.. And something wrong with RIBOTIZED GEARBOX.
Damn that Porsche is so impressive! I think that's gonna be a car I'm gonna add to my dream car list lmao
SVJ: LIKE FERRARI: REPLY TO COMMENT  PORSHE: WELL I HOPE U DONT LIKE THE POSHE BEST
I can't wait until the  992 GT2 RS comes out
I love The Lamborghini omg
Porsche.. Quiet assassin... Killing like the Ninja it is.
Between that 3 cars, why do you buy sport cars? Turbo S is the description of speed.
That Porsche really is something else entirely on the track. If only it could fucking REV.
Porche wtf?? Flat 6 literally is fucking the 12’s?
the 812 anyday for me... please?
of course i would buy the fuckn porsche. BEST CAR ON THIS PLANET
Lam.
Matt doesn't look well. Is he ok?
the porsche is the better looking car yanni that's facts
I’m not into European super cars but the super fast is hot
That turbo S... half the cylinders and half the price!  the drag race shows Porsche’s launch control is the best in the business
Ferarriii
4:00 when you go to a strip club for the first time after quarantine
Fastest: Porsche  Loudest: Lamborghini   Best Looking: Ferrari   Which One I’d Take: Ferrari
german masterpiece against italians, on the paper the least powerful, the cheapest yet it is crushing them effortlessly
So the Porsche got absolutely no attention or love at all during the build up & it was pretty much in a race of it’s own? 😅🤷🏾‍♂️
This was funny
I would have this Black on Black 812 superfast.
That Porsche is just something else!
LAMBOOOOOOO
Porsche efsane makine.mükemmel araç.baska yok.
That lambo is Slow
Haven't seen the video yet and already know the Porsche is gonna destroy em..
Turbo S is something else
Why Lamborghini is slow
The Porsche always looks like the other porches. Their designer took the plans with him after he designed it. He’s like done forever. The lambo is always trying to be much more sharper than ever, and the Ferrari which is beautiful looks like a mid life crisis in a car.  😊
Forget Porsche Ferrari lambo i just want to own a car is it too much to ask for.!!!!!
Yanny was pushing the pedal so hard I thought he would break it
Porsche rules by far...!
I would take the Ferrari all day every day
Pls do a Chiron vs Lambo Svj vs p1 that would be sick thx
the porsche is the best
Svj but not in white 🤮 😘
Yanni launched that aventador to actually keep with a turbo S  Why wasn't that time put up that was a mental run by Yanni
Porsche the baddest
911
Porsche 🤷
Lambo cheated by launching even before the flag went down.
Ferrari is slow, both on & off tracks
Porsche
Can y’all look into implementing a 3-2-1-0 score system? Just getting a point for the win doesn’t tell the whole story. I’d like to know who came in second or third in each race, not just first and last
Porsche all day long 👌🏾👌🏾
I’m so thankful I dont see any “Porsche: hold my beer” joke in the comment section
Omg that was a really nice intro. I died when Matt changed to german accent xD
Porsche 911🔥🔥🔥
Money no object-Ferrari.
Good job you left out the McLaren to give the others a chance!
I think the Ferrari looks the best but after this test i would buy the one that wasn’t there
That Porsche
Honda 2.0t vs Camry v6 vs maxima v6 vs Mazda?
Never buy Volkswagen group cars, they have terrible interior. You could be in a 911 but feel like you're in a golf.
Out of any, I’d honestly want to have the Ferrari.
Lamborghini SVJ
Yanni jump out always...cheater:-), true he never win:-)
Porsche❤❤❤❤
race start at 5:20
6:51 first look of the starter.
Gotta love that German engineering.
Porsche!!! 😍
Once you're discrete, you're sweet
Moral of the story: save ur money and buy a Porsche
Lambooooooo
5:58 “bollocks” lmaooo makes me think of James May from top gear
porsche #1 yes yes!!!!!!!!!!
Porsche is like, enjoy 2nd and 3rd place idiots...and at half the price of the lambo. Has their ever been a better bargin?
911 all day everyday!
So funny 😂
came for the drag race... stayed for the german accent haha ;)
Lamborghini
Shame the porcshe is so ugly.
Porsche ❤️
Ferrari🔥
Ferrari !!!
porsche felt kinda underrated. But we all know the real beast is the turbo s
5:23 is when they set off
Dear Yianni. I'll take the Porsche 911 Turbo S. Thank You.
Mat jumped it
Will have svj for weekends , turbo s for daily
Beetle for the Win...
The Porsche all day
The Lambo cheats off the line- pointless video
911 Turbo S any day
Onde esse porshe vai parar 😯😯😯😯 Tá destruindo até os superesportivos  bem mais leves e com aerodinâmica apurada. Esse porshe é muito louco
I think that in the rolling race they should do it on automatic because the porsche actually can do better than tha with the PDK transmission
Svj
Porsche janto as duas sem fazer esforço kkkkkkkkk
thats why i would never buy a silly looking car like lambo and ferrair when you have a normal looking car like porche, its even faster then the other ones
porsche for me
Just shut up and race the cars
The Lambo
Take the SVJ, sell it, buy a Hyundai, Profit.
Porsche 911 turbo s hands down. And most reliable out of the 3
What do you know the Germans gave underestimated hp numbers.
Lamborghini sounds best. Blame turbos for the no sound porsche
1 point for ferrari 2 point for porsche 1 point for lambo   Porsche all day everyday 😎 silent killer
SVJ
Possu olis kova
Porsche any time all the time :-)
I would take the Lambo than sell it and buy the Porsche 😁
no way i would choose a porsche instead of a lambo , lambo looks so agressive
Porsche seems too be serverely under-rated. Good too see the underdog fite back!
Id have the Porsche, everyday.  The best of both worlds, amazing looks and performance that will kill many a supercar.    It just gets the job done.
I love the 812 superfast. It was the first Ferrari that I was able to recognize immediately. Also the engine is a true work of engineering. It is (or was. I think someone beat it but idr) the most powerful naturally aspirated V12. I also love the way it looks
I love the character contrast of Yanni and Matt! And my God! The new turbo is just incredible! I drove a new Carrera S and thought it was so fast! I can’t even imagine the new turbo. I live in the mile high city in Colorado. Naturally aspirated cars definitely have a tougher time here. Anything that is forced induction has such an advantage at this altitude. Keep up the great videos!
Great episode as always. The rivalry carries these drag races. That Porsche is something else tho and its the cheapest out of the 3. Thanks guys
Omggg how long have I been waiting for a race with a svg finally
Definitely porsche 911
Man, I'd take that ferrari 812 v anyday, its such a nice looking and sounding car.
i would go with the lambo
Gt-R 2021 vs supra 2021 vs nsx 2021 please
Porsche!!!!!!!! Silent assassin 🙌🏻
SVJ all the way
For the money, the Lamborghini is shocking.
Porsche 911 turbo
Lambo
This was the most exciting race i’ve seen on this channel
Ferrari. Nicest looking. Lambo nice sousing. But Porsche is best‼️
Ferrari any day
Ferarri is gorgeous.  Corvette copied this model .
¿¿PLEASE STOP INVITING THAT FELLOW YANNI!!
The two Italians show up, spend half an hour shouting, gesticulating and waving their hands about whos is the best, meanwhile the German shows up and just gets the job done.
and that's why cheetahs don't roar
Mind destroying performace by Porsche. Brutally destroyed the horizontal and verticals
porche is a sleeper
Lambo Jumped the start !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
porsche have power
ive quite literally watched the intro 7 times
Porsche is the best looking
Funny how the Porche, which is a lot cheaper, less powerfull and very quiet, kicks ass !!
Ferrari all the way
I would have the Porsche. Any Porsche fan boys out there.
That Porsche can be just used to film these cars race.
Ferrari looks the best
911 Turbo S
Another great video guys. Mat and Yanni are an amazing duo!
Turbo S all day everyday.
That into😂
Lamborghini duuhhh Matt
Ferrari look dope😍
Intro was priceless
I wish there should be a Mclaren around the corner.. As 4th one The story could have been diff.
I knew Porsche will outperform both of them and it did.
Porsche
The Porsche of course.... ANYDAY!!!
Porsche god of cars right now
Ferrari
The ferrari 812 superfast is all about top end performance. As it's name suggests, it is superfast, if you take it to the limits. A better ferrari car for this drag race would have been the 488 pista.
“ only £156,000 “ 😂
Every two minutes 2 commercials come on now you can do better than that
I would still have the Ferrari 812.
Unbelievable. Solid proof that you can be just as fast or even faster with just 6 cylinders.  Porsche engineers, YOU GUY ARE AMAZING!
Porsche sounds so quiet that I think it is a ninja and when it is needed he just smoke those fast car in silence. Like a blazing flash in the dark night that just fly pass.
Bro y’all don’t want the smoke with the Porsche
The thing with Porsche is its not a head turner, its like seeing a MBZ on the road nothing special but if a Lamborghini or Ferrari drive past you want to take a picture.  performance: Porsche  show off: Lamborghini  both with less showoff : Ferrari
Porsche ❤️
lambo
I like how the Ferrari looks but I’d take the Porsche all day everyday. Love the Porsche
Porsche,  every day all day,  no doubt.  And there weren't even bends to make it stand out even more.  Screaming and looking nice  doesn't win a race.
Porsche got slower in later races, turbos getting hot, IATs getting hot and pulling power. NA all day, turbo wear and tear is just lame (and the sound).
Porsche
Porsche !! All the way! That’s the most good looking car. Hands down.
Lambo
Tbh, that Porsche really crushed the near hyper cars, ngl, I would buy that car if I had the cash
If you like your car reviews with an hint of racism, Matt's your man then
The porsche just walked them son.. I'd take the fucking porsche baby
Porsche 911 Turbo
The Porsche 911 is the best car ever made )
The Porsche is a race car, the other two are rich people's toys.
Porsche Superfast
porsche all day more performance for a reasonable price
Get a Porsche GT2 RS on here
Tha turboS is killing it 😂
Obviously lambo
Moral of the video: Don't buy an SVJ
Porsche all day
Porsche. Proudly made in the Deutschland.
Nothing bears ferrari's exhausts
Why does Yianni keep obviously stealing starts almost every time he's on?
Turbo s vs the Chiron
That Porsche though! Never disappointed me three times in a row. Man if I could rob a bank just to buy it I'd have done it already.
That Porsche is fast. Imagine audi r8 vs that Porsche
if money not an issue then definitely SVJ
Looks wise:1) Lamborghini 2) Ferrari 3)Porsche
I love the Porsche so much
Porsche was super awesome
svj sell and sell it for 2 911
So everyone is ignoring that the lambo jumped the start
Yanni cheated the first go. He left the line before the starter dropped her hands.
Lamborghini all day baby, that v12 sounds whistles and flutes to my neighborhood
I love every lamborghini
Aerodynamics is what helps the Porsche to go fast. Bugatti vs Porsche 911 turbo S
This Porsche is incredible, just incredible.
we need a dyno for the Porsche, Carwow make it happen.
I’ll take the 911 The 911 I was kind of in the background just to see who would win even though he won the most no one really cares
Lamborghini Aventador
"I'm doing that as well."  Lambo owner "YOU DID WHAT?"
Why not heat the tires not the Porsche ?  And he won again
I am just happy that the Porsche won in silence.
Porsche 911
Ok who is driving the 911
The best looking car is the Lamborghini.
German engineering. What can I say..
Yiann clearly started early on the first go (even though the Lambo did really well after that)
I will take the aventador SVJ
Porsche....better sound!!!!!
Rarri
These are all amazing automobiles 🤘🏽
E no mamen agregenle subtítulos al español
I wish the SVJ had a dual clutch
Half sized boxer engine crushing beefed v12. That's why I have a subaru, afdordable boxers. LOVE IT!
Imagine how fast that Porsche would be with an extra 150,000 pounds in mods.
812 best sound!!
The Porsche destroys all of them, all while looking better.
Porsche all day
Pls somone drop the ig of their sarting girl
Ferrari ... for looks alone
Don’t worry Matt, you’re not disgracing Ferrari. They have it figured out pretty well.
Lambo
Ferrari: I’m winning. Lamborghini: No I’m winning.  Porsche: Fuck this shit, I’ll leave both of you to it.
Porsche said hold my beer
The Porsche is my favorite....
The ferrari looks the best
Lamborghini ❤️
Rwd and 10.4 oh that goood for the ferrari  rolling is also start pull ahead  the others  that v12 no joke   long legs💪
Turbo S is ny vote
The Italians should stick to pasta, Yanni thinks that Lambo looks cool how old is he 5.
nobody cares about the porsche, its just between yianny and matt.
Yanni fucking cracks me up 😂😂
Mad respect to the Porsche but I reckon the Aventador SVJ would be faster if it had a proper dual clutch trans like its competitors
911 Turbo and i would drive it everyday i could
porsche is magical
812 sounds better
Svj
Porsche so simple looking but so damn fast
That 812 super fast just does something for me. The svj looks crazy in good way. The Porsche just some how is the best.
Ferrari
6:53 love the lambo just for that
I’ll take a Porsche it’s the cheapest, best looking and fastest
ferrari 812 looks the best
Lambo
Porsche
I would much rather the Ferrari for some odd reason
I love the porsch
Porsche all day long then the Ferrari all beautiful cars though!
Porsche is porsche !
812! Revs baby revs.
Matt,drag race more bmw s .Like this so matt can see
Love the Porsche 911 turbo's Theodore Roosevelt methodology, "speak softly, but carry a big stick" 😂🤣🏑
Posche
812sf i really appreciate the video
Yianni jumped the first start and accelerated early on the second rolling race! 👀👀👀
Is so easy question... of course the Ferrari. Sell for a lot and get 1 Porscha. With the rest of the money... I don't know whatever i want i guess
Svj
Ferrari
Lamborghini is better
🤔 so the Lambo is twice the price but half the performance of the Porsche , Germans are Kings of engineering 🇩🇪
Nice car 😍😍😍
Ill be honest, I think the Ferrari is BY FAR the prettiest car. But Id go for Tesla as soon as they manage their quality issues.
Ferrari sounds awsome...Lambo sounds incredible...Porche is what i would have...Its worth the cash...
Imagine if Porsche made the turbo S 800bhp like the other cars, there would never be a contest
812 SF!
Porsche 911 any day of the week.
The Porsche just don’t care
I wonder how a Hurucan evo would perform in this straight line race.
I donno why I hate every ferrari 😑
That porsche is starting to embarrass hypercars,something has to be done about it!
Mat:talking in silly accents Me: je am now unsubscribé.Merci
Yanni 100% cheated on the first race
Let's cut the BS, if you want to show off, get the Lambo or Ferrari. If you want masterful engineering and innovation, get the Porsche. But we all buy with our hearts, not heads. Ferrari for me!
APENAS VEMOS UN PORSCHE CORRER, YA SABEMOS QUE GANARA . LOVE PORSCHE, PORSCHE THE SUPER CAR KILLER
Ferrari all the everyday YANNI hahaha
Can someone tell me how do the Italians don't need a soft limiter for the sound, like the Germans, to comply with regulations?
PORSCHE!!!
Ferrari
Do a japanesse drag race
Lambo svj by far
Svj is so old tech
I’d have the Porsche 🙌🏾
911
I can see the Germans laughing at Italians with this one mate
The Rari sounds the best actually
Carwow was an actual worthy car review channel. Now its all about repetitive expensive car drags = views = ££’s 🤦🏻‍♂️
I've never screamed "come on Matt" at a drag race! You should have had that second one!!
Porsche!!! All the way
You should do a voice accent in every intro.
Matt’s accents are on point
Idk but I’m taking the Aventador if I had to choose
5:36 that sound😍🤤🤤🤤
Personally i would go with the ferrari if money was not a problem. You never really going to use that 0-60mph or that top speed but what you do use (in super car at least) is the looks and the comfort. If you drive the ferrari you will break necks left and right without breaking your ass like you'll do in Lamborghini. Also porsche looks ugly in comparison and sounds like a kia
I wonder why porsche doesn't involve in formula 1. It will be the best contender vs mercedes
Porsche
That ferrari sounds pissed
Svj and turbo tune it.. easy
Ferrari
Has someone taken that Porsche on a dyno cause it’s ridiculous
I've never clicked on a carwow video this fast. My top 3 most favorite machines in a drag race
Porsche 911.  Everyday
Porsche all day
Porsche ;)
Porsche for me please even though I'm a Ferrari fan, the 812 as a daily car isn't as good as the Porsche
Lamborghini : Vroom Vroom. Ferrari :  Eeeeeiiiii. Porsche : Good Bye!
Lesson Mat, please do not warm up Ferrari tyres ever, you ruined the drag race, the Ferrari would have demolished everything had you not stripped the tyres,.,
How can a 911 Turbo be faster than the ultimate of the ultimate big Lamborghini? Lamborghinis are everything that you want except fast, sadly
Matt is cute. No homo
Ferrari
Τι γαμησι τους έριξες ρε Γερμανέ!!!! Πως τους πετσοκοψες έτσι...!!!!!
Porsche
I would have that porsche
Porsche low key though 💯
My weed wacker aka lawn mower aka  civic sounds better than all three of these.  It’s straight piped too
812 superfast
i woud have the svj
Porsche 911 turbo s this is best sport car🔥🔥
Porsche is awesome man !!!
Bring the Laferrari
that lambo sounds so cool and the burnout limiter sound was fun.
The stone age gearbox on the aventador is killing any potential this car could have, plus other things.
Impresive the porsche, and impresive remember that the tesla models s p100d make the same time that the lambo and Ferrari jajajaja
911 Turbo S vs Mclaren 765lt?
Perfect underdog story for Porsche - no exhaust sound, no known “carwow” person driving it, no fancy drifts, but in the end wins the race. Simply no substitute”
I I had the money the lamb or Ferrari if I had less than 1m$ the porsche
Am I really the only one that notices the false starts between these guys every race, even with that the porche just runs it every single race
Ferrari for life
Porsche. Better performance and certainly more reliable. I also think it's the best looking. The Lamborghini is just another wedge with some odd angles cut into it to create a little drama, this Ferrari is reasonably elegant but also somewhat inspired in its design. The 911 Turbo S may still follow the same Porsche formula but it's more unique than either of the Italian wedges.
Porsche
Porsche All day
Money no object I would have the super fast. With an exhaust in my opinion it sounds better than the lambo. I like the look of the lambo more but I like the interior more on the ferrari. The Porsche I would have as a “sleeper”
Imagine what the new 992 GT2 RS will do
SVJ is winning I’m calling it.
Considering that the 812 is a luxury GT, it did pretty well.
Lambo
Ferrari only 👑
5:20
The f12 is the best Sounding
Porsche 911....the Best Sports Car Ever !!!
Im a lambo fan💚
Porsche👍💯
I would have the Porche, I really actually have a soft spot for the Ferrari but I believe that it does so much more with less that money no object I would have the Porche. Also it will be the easiest to live with once u leave the track and drive home.
5:26 Whenever Yanni races it’s always the “CaMon” and the head swivel.😂😂😂
Great content thank you😎
I love the porsche porsche porsche. I Have 911 carrerra 4s. Amazing interior and amazing everyday drivr the best.
Ferrari 812 superfail
I actually thought the Ferrari sounded better than the Lamborghini and I’m usually a Lamborghini sound fan
Sound battle: 812 > SVJ
I’d go with the Porsche, with all the money you save out the door compared to the other two you could make the car your own.
Not super knowledgeable when it comes to cars so can someone tell me how the porches can keep up and even beat these two cars when it has less horsepower & torque?
Svj
Best intro😂
That lambo sound is damn good but Porsche is the silent killer here.
Porsche
PORSCHE KILLS DONKEY FERRARI and SIRLOIN LAMBO !!!!
Lambo is best looking.
I'd have the 812 just because its stunning 😍 the svj is special and very nice in its own way but its so lamborghini, lol, and the Porsche is also just another Porsche, the 812 is also just another front engine v12 but that setup is so sexy, big old na v12 and nothing but the rear wheels to take care of it 😉 would be so much fun to turn traction control off and just send it 💨
Let's do a Ferrari 488 pista vs Ferrari  812 super fast🔥🔥🐎
who is giving these guys information about me.
5:20 for just the race
What Porsche??
I would take the 812 superfast all day long front engine v12 👌
I would have Porsche
Money no object I will get the Ferrari!!!😍
Definitely the Porsche
Just after seeing the cars and hearing Mat’s accents I instantly liked.
Porsche ❤️❤️❤️
911 turbo S!
Ferrari
Love the porsche 911. Wonder how they manage to pull that off from 3.5 liter inline engine...
Yani cheated in the first run, took off before she said go...
Superfast
Long live the King
Now add the McLaren 720
I like the front end ferrari the most out of any ferrari vehicles but the v12 Bull cars are always the best and most radical looking machines!
Porsche is the best .
Porsche the best!!! Ever!!!
Lamborghini
Definitely the Porsche, i loved it anyways, after todays video, its d car!! If it can beat d so called veteran’s, i am amazed.
If I had to buy it myself I'd have the Porsche. It is just an amazing daily. If I was given one it would be the SVJ because it is worth so much and would be an amazing investment.
I'd take the lambo, sell it, buy the Porsche and enjoy the rest.
I wouldn't need to watch the test to choose between them . Porsche hands down.  Looks better , it's user friendly , cheaper , German , Unquestionable classic ! And a proven track record of decades of development.  It's a 911
Why does lamborghini not use Turbo in its cars?
Do the French accent pls next time :)
SVJ
Lamborghini svjjjjj
i don't know what Porsche engineers are on, but whatever it is, i want it...
Turbo!!!
Porsche
F12
100% The turbo s.
I forgot the Porsche was there, while I was repeating the video over and over, to hear the ferocious and intoxicating sounds from the V12’s supercars. The Porsche has the best overall performance , but my senses were craving for the distinctiveness of the other cars.
That Porsche is rocker for sure I think he do 10 sec flat half mile change tires he more crib
Yes Yanni, the Lambo is the one for the posters!
812 superast by far!
When you watch this video, i realized that porsche has the best engineers in the industry. The turbo s i almost on par with the 918 spyder. So the question is, what will their next hypercar be?
I'm actually impressed by the SVJ and 812. Normally the 720s destroys them both but the turbo S beat the 720s and those 2 almost caught up with the turbo S lol
The 911 is godlike now. Crazy.
I'd take the Porsche
12:06 812 all day everyday
Mat do a race with the 911 turbo s against the tycan turbo s
Well I'll pick the Lamborghini SVJ. Yeah the Porsche dominate those Supercars but in reality you don't need to reach 190 miles coz of fuel consumption.  Lambo looks, speed and sound
I want a Ferrari
everyone talking about the Porsche I get it I'm a Porsche guy 2 and they always offer more for the price but that Ferrari man. Only if it was all wheel drive it would have smacked both of them easy. Ferrari just doesn't make all wheel drive cars bcs it gotta keep the enthusiast heart in their cars. 800hp from a naturally aspirated engine is just WoW
Ferrari
Lambo
I'd have the Porsche any day, thanks !
Lamborghini anyday anytime 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ill have the Porsche it's the best looking
Porsche🤩
Why does the Porsche consistently dominate these drag races despite less power or torque and similar weight? Is it the specific distance?
would rather have the Porsche
Ferrari is always a ferrari❤
Porsche
cs panda: has like 21 subscribers 6:35 also cs panda: gets a shoutout on carwow
Why's it hard to be a Tifosi even on Carwow!? =(
The accents were great tho lmao, my opinion
Actually the 812 is much faster than I expected
Is it me or was this race blazingly fast...
Lamborghini SVJ
That Porsche is evil
Turbo S is the best all round car there but I’d have an 812 because it’s more special. I prefer the F12 looks but I still think the 812 is better looking and sounding than the SVJ, Yianny is waffling 😂
the porsche for all day out but ferrari for weekends only
Only one car for me out of those 3, has to be the Turbo S. It is a lot cheaper, WILL be the most reliable, and is the quickest. Honestly, what is not to like?
Even thought a Ferrari is a Ferrari  And a Lambo is a Lambo The Porsche looks the best has the best performance and has the best interior. Its just a 911. Classic
Money no object then the Ferrari. The lambo’s transmission is a deal breaker for me.
Ferrari 812 superfast because it’s a GT car  that is just majestic
Damn Porsche sure did put on target on their back, didn't they? Just like when the R35 GTR first came out. If only Nissan actually kept their sh*t together.
So funny my friend italiani and GHermaNn hahahaha.  Love your Chanel ..... 👍👍👍
I love Lambo. Soo always Lamborghini.
PORSCHE🔥🔥🔥
Can anything beat this Porsche?!
The 992 still like a boss
Do a zr1
Almost 4 minutes of intro Matt😑😑
Porche🤩
Drag Race at 5:20
Porsche is just more superior
I'll trade you my 15 toyota camry.
Ferrari is the better car, I DONT CARE
Lamborghini sounds better then ferriari and Porsche
Wow that Porsche is no joke😳😳
svj is the better looking car here
Cheapest and best car wins, the one you can turn up anywhere and no one will bat an eye or think you’re a posy twat!
If you want to be the king of the hill you choose Porsche
Porsche!
It would be great to know the speeds as well as the times.
God I love Porsche!!!!!!!!
Is it me or this is the best  drag race on this Chanel
Why do I see the lambo coming last ?!
SVJ : Does donuts Carwow: Shows Yianni instead of the SVJ doing donuts
Porsche- the silent killer 🔥🔥🔥
I would choose The lambo all day long
SVJ
Yanni has such an aggressive face when racing🤣
"Accept no substitute"
The Porsche dyh
Prosche 911 all day long.
PORSCHAAAAAAA❤️
The new 911 turbo s is the most insane car right now just destroying cars with 150 more horsepower and double its price its ridiculous
That Ferrari is one of the finest automobiles on the planet today, how many cars you know have n/a V12’s that can rev to 9k rpm? Not much. That Porsche is definitely in the top 5 best performance car bargains of the decade and its a great example of impeccable engineering success. But if I can have one, it would be that Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, not because only 63 where made, but because how special that car is from behind the wheel. From the way it sounds to the way it drives to the perfomance. This car is all about thrill and excitement. Its a supercar that can be fun at even low speeds which you cant say about alot of other supercars.
Ohoooo the porscheeeee🤗🤗
Ciao bella @mattwatson
That 812 is a menace in black and yellow
People complain about turbos and ask for naturally aspirated and then when the n.a. loses they get mad. Lol. Cars are not all about 0-60. I'd pick the 812 all the life. Fuck that ugly and all the same Porsche
Best performance car goes to Porsche 911, best sounding car goes to the SVJ, best looking car goes the the Ferrari
Porsche be like — I dont need to burn my tires to beat those italian cars
Lmao
Ferrari sounds the best
Bruh take la Bugatti to beat the Porsche. It s the only way!
Porsche all day everyday!!!
The fastest drag time in carwow is from a bike
911 and GTR  Super car destroyer .  With engine V6 😏👍🏽
This is why I love Porsche and this is why we have a 911.
Porsche any day
Get Some sleeper cars against the super cars / high price cars
911 💪
911 sure
"doesn't look as good" excuse me! I think the Porsche is sublime.
Ferrari hands down sounds good
Porsche driver is just yawning in the background
812 Super Fast looks the best imo.
lambo jumped the first one
Love that 911 turbo s
The BEST SOUND 812
Ferrari for me, lambo a little too over the top in the styling for me, German Porsche brutally efficient
Porsche all the way 💪
6 cylinders!! Damn I love Porsche
Yanni always tries to take off before time . . .
Porsche all day long
That porche has got to really be making atleast 700 h.p
El mamadore copiando a @salomudo
S.V.J
7:57 GT car RWD vs 219 Kg lighter Supercar AWD Congratulations Ferrari 812 Superfast, you are the best car ever, now let's see your boot space of 320 litres.
Lamborghini
Lambo all the way. 👍
I love to get on Porsche
Lambo all day everyday!
Wayyyyy toooo manyyyyy adsss
Imagine paying all that money but getting left by the porsche
Porsche
These  are real dragraces
The starting 😂😂
The Lamborghini sounds the best
Can we just have a moment to take in the fact that a six cylinder turbo car just killed 2 V12 naturally aspirated súper cars. Damn, that’s why I love Porsche.
Turbo S !!!!!!
But yeah, money no object I’m taking that 812. If I had the choice I’d take the 812 GTS.
Is yanni taking the piss the way he “heated his tires” on his mates car who he said know one has driven limiter bashing the whole time
I am Italian and I'd have the Porsche, hands down.
Carwow should do lap times as well, this SVJ is bad in the drag races but would absolutely dominate a circuit
Svj sounds like a honda
You should do a 3 mile race en then see how they compare
SVJ tune and exhaust
Put some respek on ze Germans.
Don't judge a book by its cover mate
That intro was perfect
Never liked a video within the first 10 seconds before 😂, nice Matt
Lambo
VIVA LA PORSCHE.
Ferrari looks the best, but id definitely would put my money on the porche
Yannie and Matt are so funny together. Had me rolling with laughter when Yannie said he put his head forward like a sprinter.
Porsche any day!
That porsche is half the price of lamborghini and half the cylinders. Its crazy how he kicked its ass. 🙏
Id have the Porsche, but id wait for the release of the GT2RS version.
Porsche 911 always & forever.........................................
Svj
Lambo all day long!!!!!!!!!
The Porshe is the best car and value, but Lambo is best looking...
porsche the GOAT
Yani totally jumped the start
Porsche
One hell of a race, probably the best race you’ve ever done. No problems launching, no wierd outcomes just the best race ever!!
Since 76, the Porsche turbo is still at the top of the pile!, no debating!!!
Really YouTube 4 commercials in a 13 min video!   Awesome race !
If these Cars were death note characters then surely the Porsche had to be L
Yanimize has such a good energy. Really enjoy the videos when he is in. Keep up the good work
Bruh I just noticed how good ferrari look😅black and red ONLY
Lamborghini
Ferrari better looking
And the moral is it's not about money it's about engineering, the cheapest car is the fastest it would seem
Porsche all the way. But looks, Ferrari!
Porsche for me, even looks
Porche is fast but only off the line
The Ferrari sounded the best the lambo just sounds like it’s taking a shit
The Porsche won the Rev ahahah
Would love to sometimes see motorcycles included in the dragraces!
As a daily the Porsche, for track the SVJ as grand tourer the Superfast.
That porsche is from hell🔥🔥🔥
id have the svj all day and maybe add some turbos for hyper speed lol
Porsche
812.
Svj
does no one ever actually mention matt speaking in german italy accent?😂😂😂
Porche
Porsche !👌
this guys spray / bottle tan is dire
812 Superfast is one of the most attractive front engines that's ever graced these roads. Definitely the 812 over the other 2
F12 superfast 😍
German Heart, Porsche
Ferrari:RRRAAAAAAAAAA!!!! Lamborghini:BBBBRAAAAAA!!!! Porsche:brrrr Porsche: still wins🤨
And Ferrari sounds better
Y wouldn’t u put a gt3 rs or gt2 rs instead
Guys, you have to get use to it, it's not the noisiest that is the quickest and it s just the beginning ... Porsche forever.
Lamborghini all day, every day
I love Yanni Lamborghini Aventador S
sound test. Lambo
PORSCHE !!!! 😁
Krowa, która dużo ryczy mało mleka daje ;p
I feel porsche have over 1000 hp
Like someone said. TurboS is like Clark Kent
Porsche 911 turbo S
porsche❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️
Ferrari
Put all three in a circuit and the lambo and 911 will be toast.
i’ve been watching carwow for the past 4 years without being subscribed, and I just subscribed today since matt was being silly driving on that funky tpms
“Yeah and that Lambo done really well against the Porsche considering we all know what the Porsche is about.” That is honestly about the highest praise you can give the car lol, we cannot forget he is talking about Lamborghini’s top of the line v12 offering lol. Wtf is that new 911 Turbo like wtf.
Yanni is the best
For me the Lamborghini
I would choose Porsche 911 Turbo S, but the Ferrari is the better looking car of the 3.
HAHAHA that Turbo S.   I drove mine today.  10.5@132 with wheelspin in three gears at the strip last night. :)
how did the porsche win
Minute 1 of the video: me: what the hell is a porsche doing there.  Minute 12 of the video: me: what the hell is a ferrari and a lamborgini doing there.
4:19 Porsche 911 Turbo S revs  Tesla: I can do better than that !! Lol
https://youtu.be/lC7SNg2BUPQ  here you go, 720s does 9.8
https://youtu.be/lC7SNg2BUPQ  here you go, 720s does 9.8
I used to love the ferrari but after my father bought his first Porsche I fell in love with them immediately, it gives a performance worth the money, it has the best interior out of the 3 and it's the most comfy sport car ever probably.  Like the old man said a dog that barks doesn't bite same with lambo and ferrari xd. Great job from the porsche team!
Love how stupid are the guys in the comments, the Svj is most extreme hypercar of Lamborghini, the Turbo S is a supercar dedicated to performance, the 812 is just a powerful GT, it should be compared to the DBs superlegera or another GT , its performances are incredible for its category
Porsche has ran their launch control over 1200 times in a row without any problems.   THe engineers called it quits 'cause it was 5pm.  The Porsche will do that all day long, better, cheaper and faster.
Porsche
812 is the sexiest car ever, only less sexy than the laferrari
Ciao Bella! It’sa Mata Watsan froma di Carrrrrwowwwww 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
German engineering is boss.  THE END!
Which one for me? 911 Turbo. Every single time. I would like to actually drive the thing instead of having it in the shop for repairs 8 months out of the year...
Porsche
Porsche be like: let my success make the noise.
I would choose Porsche over any car.
asks us to sub to his personal YT channel, last post was 3 months ago. Subbed anyway
This is like a race between the lambo and the Ferrari. The Porsche is just doing its thing.
Porsche is goat
Porsche looking better then the others for sure and yanni is a fat bastard.
Ferrari 812 superfast is my dream car. But i like porsche 911 too. Between them ferrari.
Definitely the Porsche
Porsche all day long
That 911 is such an amazing machine, it’s like Godzilla 2.0
I would go for Ferrari just for the looks and history(yes, I'm kind of a fanboy)
that ferrari was super quick! better than the ferrari SF1000
Tbh I love Lamborghinis alot so Lamborghini svj
Holy shit. 800k in a few hours
Porsches' are engineering marvels. they're insane.
Proper test would have been GT2 rs but you know
This just goes to show that the Porsche is just LEAGUES ahead. Especially the PDK in the roll races.
Lamborghini !
812 superfast ofc
Yammi is always so aggressive on the launch 😭😂
Porsche is the best
I would have the 911 of course, the best car
Yianni jumped the first race, then Matt jumped the second race smh
Yianni JUMPED the first one!! Matt JUMPED the second one!! Still 911 won both XD
Italiani? 00:00 😂😂🤣🤣
The Ferrari says DO NOT PROCEED IN RED so matt proceeds and says something aint right lol
Turbos take it and not drama.
I would like to have the porsche...
If I had my own money it would be a ferrari
Germans won. AGAIN.
I would take the Porsche all day
Ein Italiener schlägt niemals einen Turbo S vom Start, niemals
Porsche. All day
Turbo S
Stopped watching right at 1:00 just can't stand that dude.
Turbo S
ferrariiiiii
Yianni jumped the line
Yanni won everything.
I'd take the Porsche
I have a question, I know that yanny have yannimize or something like this for car wrapping, but do car wrapping business really generate that much money or he have other business? I know this aventador is not his but still he have many expensive car
The Porsche driver was wearing a Porsche shirt in addition to a Porsche hat. That’s why he won, definitely. It’s just insane that car can perform like that. Remove the soft limiter and put on a different exhaust and they sound pretty cool. As much as I love the sound and style of the 812, if I couldn’t have all three, I’d have to choose the Porsche. Of all of them, you could most easily drive it every day and it wouldn’t care. It would also stand out less, relatively speaking.
I want the Porsche
Ferrari 812 Superfast: The GT car with performance of a Super car.
Porsche all the way, in response to everything
Porsche of course !
I love Ferrari
mat is too funny with that intro
Turbo S, heavier than the Lambo,  over 100HP less, costs less than half, and still wins lol
Turbo s the best ever
THIRTY pots 🙂
best drag race
Best looking: aventador Quickest: porsche Most fun: ferrari Ferrari would be the most fun because its rwd so I can drift that hoe around the track and do donuts
Would def get the Porsche
Would like to know how fast could be the Ferrari if it had 4wd
The Porsche 911 Turbo S is always my fave. And for good reason !
Za German oh
That Porsche amazes me every single time. What an absolute beast
812 sounds better
Yanni always cheats the countdown🙆‍♂️😂😂
Alright, I give up.  How does the Porsche beat those two??
SVJ
https://youtu.be/lC7SNg2BUPQ  here you go, 720s is faster
I'm buying 911
PORSCHE FOR THE WIN! That car is amazing
Ferrari
SVJ all day even that I love the Porsche
Ferrari
That Ferrari is the best looking car
Why the fat annoying guy again?
This may be the most expensive race in carwow lol
Buy a porsche and house with the rest compared to those other two lol
I'm so glad you didnt put any memes in this video. It was pure. love it. I'll take Ferrari based on looks and Porsche on speed.
Another quality display from the 'cheap' German silent assassin.... But nearly 5 and a half mins before racing starts... It's getting too much about presenters and 'merch' with every new post.
Porsche, All Day!
Yanni stays  jumpin the line street race he would lose that money...o yea and put some gas in that Lambo wtf
Ferrari 812 superfast
I love this guys humour lmao 👌🏽👌🏽🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Der Turbo ist ein Killer
Should have included the 720s
Never mess with German cars!☝️ the Lambo sounds like a fight-jet but lose!
Well, I would have a 2021 FORD GT HERITAGE EDITION, but of the 3 cars there, Ferrari 812 no question.
Porsche !!!
Lamborghini Huracan would defet them all  🤩🤩😍😍
Porsche for the win...as always
Oh ya and if  I could have one it would be the 812
Lol the Porsche drop them all it was funny and fun to watch especially because I am of course your fan boy is  So yah also Porsche looks better
The Porsche 911 Turbo S has always been a drag king but the 812 Superfast is stunning !! I see the SVJ around my ends all the time ... beautiful car and I would personally buy the SVJ !!
I love Porsche, retry that test when the GT3 RS stay ready
Ferrari by a mile my favourite car
Porsche is beauty.. always
That Porsche is insane
Loved the Accents!!!
It's very hard to choose .. porsche is the best and cheapest .. lambo is looks and sounds like a jet fighter ... i will choose the lambo because of that
Porsche all day long!
Can't imagine how insane the "special version" of the 812 will be
The mclaren 765 lt is finally gonna teach that stupid porsche a lesson
Awesome. I enjoyed so much. I knew Porsche gonna win.
911 turbo for sure.
Let’s be honest here. That Porsche deserves a medal of awesomeness. It’s impressive that a car which costs way less and is more comfortable than the SVJ is able to beat it by quite a bit. That Porsche is essentially a super car slayer!
Porsche is the best
Svj
All these people (not on this post)saying that the new turbo s will destroy a p1😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👊
I would get the svj, and then sell it and buy 2 Porsche 911 turbo s
nice
We need sf90 stradale and 765lt
Ferrari sounded better
HEYY PLease Make a Video of All the  moments of Yanni Reactions when he gets disappointed We Will ALL LOVE  IT  AND TO LAUGH AND LIKE
You should always put yanny in the videos the chemistry between you two is incredible or do a show
Weird to compare that ferrari and lambo together. I cringed when those lambo clutch packs cried out in pain.. sigh. Don't lend your lambo to that guy lol.
I choose Porsche sorry guys
911 Turbo S.... Yes
Nobody: Absolutely no one: Not a single soul:  Yianny: COME ON
ferrari all the way
Yanni is hilarious hes always so serious once the racing starts lol as usual great video
Porsche always win
Porsche overall but the Lamborghini is the one I’d like to own
i reckon i'd have the 812 superfast(ish). i think it has the better sounding engine.
Porsche
its the little things that make CarWow stand out from other channels.. love the Thumbnail with  names on the plates.. so we can see if Yianni is in the house....
it's not even funny how INSANE of a car the Turbo S is!!
Porsche is a weapon! I need one in my life! 🙏🏼
Yess PORSCHE SOUNDED THE BEST!!!!!
Bruh the lambo got a heads tart in the first race
That Porsche is simply amazing! Has anything beaten it?
I would rather have the silent killer       *The Porsche*
Yanni : "come on, hoho" 😂😂😂😂
Jump start in the Lambo 1st race.
812 all day for me
@CARWOW why can't you do a review of BMW 3.0 CSL HOMMAGE
I'm a lambo fan but, PORSCHE ALL DAY!!!! I've had 2. Panamera turbo and 911 turbo. Going for the new turbo s.
GT2 RS vs anything? I bet it will do under 10.
Porsche won!!!! I knew it.
The Porsche did really well other than the engine noise.
Those v12s sound amazing, but it just shows how good value for money the porsche is from a performance perspective

Porsche is the baby boss
Lamborghiniiiiiiiii!!!!!
The SVJ sounds unsane Oh my god🙆🏾‍♂️😭
Lamborghini
Porsche is pure engineering, love it. Imagine it with a little tuneup
Español
Porsche
Porsche will always when.
992 TT anyday
The ugly Porsche keeps winning ....😐
YESSSS PORSCHEEEEEE FOR THE WINNNN
Let's not forget that the SVJ is Lamborghinis ultimate and best Aventador and the turbo isn't even the crazy one in the 911 line up 🤣
the ferrari in these drag races makes the same figure as the counterpart in formula 1 this year! and this porsche 911 is unbeatable if I had the money I would buy it😍
The lambo won but do a gtr vs gtr vs gtr
porsche...
Beat by with Porsche (sound don't make car faster 🙄 )
Ferrari 812 superfast
Why do the boring cars have to be the fastest. Teslas and porsches bore the pants off me
ahaha the cheapest car is the better one ................also to bad is the mos ugly(the porshe design team must be fired and the engineeres must have a rise)
911 turbo s is flawless
Love the Porsche, but I’d have the 812
id have the ferrari for the looks and the sound
Forza Italia
So basically... The Porsche won 2, the Ferrari won 1... And the Lamborghini won nothing. Yanni never wins much apparently lol
Out of these three cars I’d take the Porsche
812 superfast
2 horses and a bull
Ferrari " By a mile " lmaoo Really enjoy watching your vedios matt. keep it up😁👍
only engine "CORSA he could do a race but quickly ok ...
How many Lambos do You have? Yani: YES!!!
Porsche
One word...Porsche❤❤❤
“You should go back to your winyard and sip your Silly Italian wine. Und then you can punch each other silly.. und ya un dusen dusen"
Wowwwwwwwwwwwww
The passion that Yianni puts in is 2nd to none...COME ONN!!!  That SVJ sounds insane, hands down winner
the rs models are gonna be damn crazy
carwow: im the ad king
Shout out to Porsche engineers.  3.8L V6 slaying V8s and V12s..  what sorcery is this?
German Engineering 💪
Porsche all day
Ferrari Superfast over the Porsche when not factoring cost..
I love how the 812 superfast looks
hello i would like to tell you something about the lamborghini aventador SVJ because he doesn't know how to put the engine "CORSA" he knows because of the "STRADA" it is not to run at full speed
I love how the porsche is there for no reason, but is way faster
Weekend : Ferrari,  Daily: Porsche...
Porsche is the GOAT
Honestly. Both the Lamborghini and Ferrari make that Porsche look very boring.
ferrari sounds the best but id go for porsche half the money and mad fun out of both super cars 🤑
It's kinda sad how the turbo s is the fastest, no one cares when you drive one into a car meet unlike the Lamborghini or Ferrari.
Sound doesn't matters right
And once again ze Germans showed their military prowess..
The Lamborghini Aventador SVJ does make the better sound
accurate representation of the pace of Ferrari in F1 right now
That porsche is amazing! Its not lighter and giving away over 100bhp, its worth so much more than the sum of its parts. Really does show that you dont need 800bhp plus its how you put it down that matters. I bet this new T50 with its measly 600ish bhp would blow through 10seconds on this test i would love to see that!
Gimme the porsche all day
1. Porsche 2. Ferrari 3. Lamborghini  If money is no object
Still take the Ferrari
812
Wow Porsche is so super. With just 3.8 it beats the 6.5 v12 's.  Imagine if it were 4.5 . Mat too funny
🤣🤣🤣🤣 The accents
The Porsche proves that 12 cylinders are useless.
Porsche is so underrated
We don’t need to be sis laut to be faster sen sis Italian cars.  Greetings the GERMANS
Wow that Porsche is really fast...
The Ferrari Sounds The best 🚗.
"I actually put my head foward, like a sprinter to get the extra mm" shows clip of yanni  Yanni: "Ugghhh!"
Porsche reached perfection with this 992 generation !! Killed Ferrari and Lambo !!
Porsche sounds better
The porsche 911 turbo s is the best supercar for the money
LA Ferrari Vs  Svj Vs Porche would be an absolute stun !!!!!
Would it be possible to race a 812 N Largo vs a McLaren 720s  Anybody who watches Producer Michael knows what I’m talking about
Ferrari anyday
⚜  The Porsche is 🤴🏻 ⚜
Lambo Ferrari weight to much the Porsche super lightweight
SVJ - it’s the most rare, it sounds the best and it would be the most spectacular to own 🔥
812 Super Fast all life long, way over the 911, the SVJ is awesome but unless you go on the track, it's gonna break your back.
I would have a Turbo S out of the 3, tune it to 1000hp and it would be more comfortable and faster than the other 2 while still costing less. (And borderline more practical)
Lamborghini aventador sv looks better than svj
Turbo S is a King
Enzo and ferrucio be rolling in their graves rn
Porsche 👌
I am all out for the Porsche very well made simple.
Porsche 911 turbo S 👍🏽
Only thing holding the aventador back is the single clutch transmission. The Porsche has a PDK which is insane fast lightning fast shifts which gives it the slight advantage. However, all are great cars.
Please stop sleeping on Porsche.......Cause didn't you get beat by it a few times well actually alot of times
SVJ 💯🔥
BEST RACE I'VE EVER SEEN
i am porche boy
‘It’s a Marioo’
Great, except Yanni's constant shouting makes me turn the volume all the way down and not hearing the cars.
PORSCHE!!!!!!!!!!!   🔥
I’d rather have a Tesla
Porsche has always been fastest,  dull, but fastest.
do 720s vs turbo s rematch with the 720s on stock tyres. also , warm them up
I prefer the Porsche as it's a more practical car compared to the other 2.
lambo
1st race the lambo took off early at the start...so yeah...technically the lambo lost...
Porsche all day!
German best
Lamborghini
Great start! A great accent 😀👍🏼
Porsche all day everyday! To be the least pricey car and least powered yet it puts on a good fight. I'd go with the 911 turbo S
That 911 gives me so much joy. A true under-appreciated silent killer with more than 100hp less than the other ones and yet it beats them.
Just new the Porsche would win.
Yeanni had been watching at the opponents more than the anything...he had to focus. He did well in the first round and he can do better in the other rounds
Love the 812
Porsche is dady of the game
Porche the best🔥 performance n looks too, mile ahead then lambo..!! Lambo seems like toy...yakk..!!
Porche the best🔥 performance n looks too, mile ahead then lambo..!! Lambo seems like toy...yakk..!!
Porsche. Modern Lamborghinis are ugly and that is the ugliest Ferrari the make.
Bro if I want a fast car I'm buying a Porsche 911 for sure and if I want it to be loud I'll just set up Akrapovic on it
I would take Ferrari! I don't care about the fractions of a second!
Poor Yianni didn't look left for the Porsche  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Porsche 911 Turbo S Fast Reliable Comfortable Daily drive Much more affordable to buy and to maintain Less people attention
Absolutely love Porsche, it kills everyone!!
Awesome 😁😁😁😁
Porsche
Let’s go Porsche! And also gotta respect the Ferrari...the lambo just lackin
The rarri
The PORSCHE!!! It just does the work.
Porsche any time, any moment
Love you yanni ...you should be here more often
Dammn such a awesome race and good choice of cars
SVJ: Sound Test 812 Superfast: I would have 911 Turbo S: idk
Svj anyday
I'd have the Porsche hands down, but that Ferrari is my favorite Ferrari ever made, so i'd take the Super Fast over the SVJ.
The Turbo is gonna win all day long
German Engineering guys!!!
Good drag race, very nice :)
812 superfast all day every day !!!
911 turbo s (992) 650hp vs 911 GT2 (991.2) 690 hp
The guys who made porshe were geniuses
Bugatti drag race
I knew Porsche will destroy these cars before even watching it.     #PORSCHEFORLIFE
Porsche ever ever ever 👏👏✌️✌️
992
He opened the Ferrari door with the leg😑 10:27
Never race the Ferrari 812 superfast !!! Porsche is the king of 🇩🇪. Out and Ferrari make cars whit performance lamborghini make fast car
The Lamborghini drivers jumps all the time of the line
@11:33 the face on the Porsche's driver....Priceless 🤣
Porsche all day
Porsche all day
Ferrari sounded the best and I'd be glad to make that Ferrari my daily driver
The Ferrari is the best looking car hands down. And what would happen if it was 4 wheel drive...? 😃
The Porsche everytime..... Can drive it every day & it won't let you down....
Porsche
Porsche
That Porsche is an animal and the price difference that car wow 🤩
The khadi the Gardi
Ferrari♥️
I'd have the 992 Turbo S with a Stage 1 tune. It'll kill the other 2 in the rolling races too.
Turbo s is best🥰🥰
The accents made me weak
That 812 superfast is the best looking car
Lamborghini all day every day❤️
This is what I always wanted  svj vs 911 turbo oh and I guess the Ferrari is good too
Why not show the times of both races ?
That porsche sounded like a tesla powered butterfly 😂😂😂
Now imagine buying a Turbo S and spend “only” 20k in Upgrades, what the f**k it all would beat.
A lot of exhaust sound !!
Porche are  underrated
Yianni always jumps the start of the drag races and the rolling races plus he always breaks too early, really don’t want to be that guy but you need to get him to sort it out because it really detracts from the otherwise excellent videos so annoying 🙄
Aventador SVJ any day 🔥❤️
Total  Porsche domination. The Italo-fanboys must be barfing up their pasta. The 812 looks pretty though
1. Ferrari 812 Superfast (beauty)  2. Porsche 911 Turbo S (perfect) (engineering)  3. Lamborghini Aventador SVJ (ugly) (too expensive)
Ferrari 🏎
Awesome 🔥🔥🔥
So the Ferrari is the better car.
i would have the lambo
Matt we want to see these three cars up against the Mclaren P1.... I know you can make this happen :)
SVJ all day
definitely the Porsche!!!!
There's no replacement for displa... Oh wow look at that boxer 6 cylinder crushing V12 nooooooo! 😂
SvJ all day
Who's driving the Porsche never see the 3rd driver :-)
Can we get a GT2 RS in this race?
911 turbo s is the best all the way around 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Why does yanni push his body front and make that face as if its gonna make him faster
Porsche and mclaren destroy Italian cars
Pooooorsche💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Lamborghini svj
Porsche 992 Turbo S, the King of 1/4 mile! 🤴 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Why don't you review a Lamborghini
Yannie is so annoying
that smile at 11:33 🤣🤣
How does that make sense? The Porsche has less hp than both and it still won? Can anyone explain ???? I’m shocked
Get an older F1 car or a touring car to do the drag. We need to get below 10’secs
Svj
Race starts at 5:21
When are we gonna break the 10 sec barrier?
Ferrari is the Ferrari
Porsche
812!
Porsche anyday anytime.
Porsche
I’m a BMW fan, but thank you Porsche
Porsche: Killing in Silence
Mat: I've totaly disgraced Ferrari with that  meanwhile Ferrari: Belgium FP3
If we´re not looking at money, I´d have the Porsche 911 no doubt it looks the best
cute
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ sounded the best 😎
Ferrari is the best looking  car, but that porsche is so timeless it’s just perfect
SVJ
I LOVE THE PORSCHE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The rolling race shows the difference between a GT car and a sports car. When you’re pulling out to pass someone, which is way more important in the real world than a drag race, I would much rather have to 812.
Porsche all day. You couldn’t really use the other cars for everyday use
the bull jumped the first race
Porsche wiped its ass with the lambo and Ferrari !  How good is Porsche !
That cap 🧢 is aerodynamic
Hey Matt,  Never ever think or allow yourself to be worry that you may die. It's all because of your powerful mind, it will happen. So, never say it in front of the camera, tell anyone or play it in your mind. Just be positive and say, think and feel the positive. Thanks for the video. Well, three of those supercars are amazing. However, I'll choose base on my budget. 😂😂😂😂
Anytime Ferrari 😊
I'd have the Porsche, easy choice
Funny how much slower the Lambo was when it didn't jump the start
Bloody brilliant Porsche
I’d have the Porsche all day Ferrari’s and lambos are rapper cars
Yanni cheating, as usual 🙄 😒
That fucking Porsche my God
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ for sure and it is my dream car
I REEEALY hope Lamborghini put a proper dual-clutch into their next flagship car.
Not a drag race between three cars, every episode is race between Matt and Yanni... forget the third one 😅😂
Definitely going for the porsche. It's the fastest, and most practical of the 3
5:22 Yanni totally jumps the start he moves before her hands came down
Take the Lamborghini, be confused and impressed by the super subtle Porsche, and disappointed by the Ferrari.
The Porsche is a timeless car man!! 🇩🇪 🇩🇪
I hate watching people drive on the right(wrong) side of the car🤡

Imagine what Yianni would say if they did the sound check but Ferrari had the full Novitec exhaust system? Who would win then, haha?
The 911 Looks classyer, just the sound is awful 😔 thx greta
LAMBORGHINI aventador SVJ 63 Edition
Now the svj vs the Performante.
812sf is 🔥
LAMBORGHINI aventador SVJ 63 Edition
How can a car so fast be so quiet?
Where's the Sandero tho
Porsche all day
I would definitely have a Porsche over the rest
Porsche 👑
I would have the porsche without question.
Lamborghini
Is it me or are Lamborghini’s just so disappointing in a straight line? Compared to rivals that is. 770bhp and 4 wheel drive and can only just beat a car with similar power which is RWD by 2ft. Gorgeous vehicles but as far as performance they are way off for what the stats suggest.
Porsche 911. The perfect Sports Car from the beginning.
Seems like he would be tired of losing in those Lamborghinis. Porche is the fastest and you can drive it everyday.
911 turbo for me.
A moment of silence for the Porsche.
I love that the one with half the cilinders wins...
The engineers at Porsche deserve a pay raise
I'm sorry but that 911 turbo is amazingly reliable and fast. Stealth at its best. Non of that annoying noise that cops can hear for miles.
German engineering...the same fast with the half size of the engine 🤣
The 911 by far
Porsche.
Lambo, though at least you can drive the Porsche every day. Just sounds rubbish.
Porsche. Great value for money lol
Can you please show us the face of the countdown girl 😅😅😅
Porsche : Am I a joke to you 😂
you should drag race the lexus lfa
Pls get the dodge demon to race the Porsche
A wise man once said "It' s shouting and power versus thoughts and torque"🧐
That Porche it incredible😍 Its impossible😲
I love those accents 🤣
Ferrari looks the best to me, Lambo looks like a toy and Porshe is just ok
Ide go with Ferrari
Lambo false start lol 2nd anyways
Porsche❤❤
Porsche ❤
911
The black Ferrari...the most beautiful for sure but to be honest... even the others are ok😅
992 dominates
812 absolute dream car
Turbo S... that is will be my next one... order done!🤘🏻😁
What the fu*k about all porches?! 😍
Until you bring a Veyron that Porsche isn’t going down.
Porsche!
9/11 Still 👑
Yianni jumped the first race
El sonido del Aventador es magnifico, y el ferrari simplemente es cool
One of the best drag races ever !!
Wow so closeee
Porsche ❤️❤️🚬
812 Superfast
There is no way I'd lend my car to them based on how these guys treat them. Very little respect.
Porsche sounds best, also i have my cereal with water
I'd ha e the porsche. It's better, cheaper, and will eat the Ferrari and Lamborghini around a corner and in any condition. Why spend double for a measurably worse car when I can take the kiddo to school and troll everything short of a Chiron. It's not even a competition.
I'd have the ferarri then the 911 then the lambo.... but Its like choosing between 1000 1001 1002 dollars
2nd race was the most exciting this year!
Porsche.... insane car
812 superslow
Porsche ❤
The ferrari sounds better than the svj. To me, Lamborghini’s v12’s haven’t sounded as good as Ferrari’s since the murcielago
Lambo SVJ
Porsche all day
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Lamborghini for sure!
Porsche 911 turbo every time
That Porsche is nuts!
Still the SVJ has performed well.
Porsche all day
I like the Ferrari 😁😁
That Porsche. Always did more with less. Superb.
The porche may not look it! But it’s a monster!
They can’t find a car to beat the Porsche
The 911 Turbo S is absulutely incredible.
812 for me
yianny jumped the start
Porsche...but the sound of the Lambo....mucking afazing
Porsche 911 all day long
Want the Porsche
I love how the Porsche is just in the background crushing them.
Porsche!!!
The Porsche is the cheapest and best car here  I am a massive Porsche fanboy but these are still facts 😆
dog that barks hard doesn't bite
The Sound is nothing
WOW THE BEST DRAG RACE!
I want the Porsche 911 Turbo S.. in blue please. Thanks If you could... a GT2 RS, same color
Concidering the Porsche being turbocharged car engine what IT would do to the supercars in stage 1 - humiliation!
What about putting all the cars horsepower , torque and other specifications on one screen side by side so we can compare them easily?
911turboS
If I could get one, that would be the Ferrari for sure.
Porsche
911
🐍 Cobra 🐍 Porsche 🐍  killer 🐍
Porsche half the price twice the car you'd be able to launch that all day long
What carwow?! More like NFSU2wow! Btw, if I only had 200 k to spend on a fast car, I'd definitely go for the Porsche.
Porsche 💪💪💪❤️
911 Turbo S vs Lamborghini Huracan EVO
That Porsche 911 turbo s is actual slient killer though literally I mean it actually beat those Lamborghini and ferrari which unbelievable thumbs up for Porsche👍👍👍.
First 20 sec i listen 3 times haha 😁 very nice bro! 💪 U nailed it
Seriously... looks like the race was between Ferrari and Lamborghini but clearly that 911 won
As a channel focused on Drag Race I think you could go up a level in the technical tests. it would be enough to present the pilots' weight and fill the fuel tank with sufficient quantity to level the weight added to the cars in the sum of the pilot and fuel. this would make the test more fair and interesting.
The Porsche no question
Lmfao yanni dipped forward lol yanni the best bro 😂😂😂😂😂
Porsche, All day everyday 🙌🏽
IDC That 812 is the moist maker.
Svj everytime
Lamborghini needs to sponsor Yianni. He makes their brand look better
Dam son this porsche🤒🔥
The accents made me like this😂😂😂
porsche,
Ferrari best engine by far. Drag race disadvantage because of huge power on rear wheels only (+ weight). Rolling race race shows what the engine can do. Oh, and by the way, the 812 will hold value much better in the years to come. Looking forward to see how the SF90 stradale will perform.
Porsche all day
Lamborghini svj
I want that Porsche
Hahaha. Porsche with 120+hp less and £££s cheaper. Hahaha
Flat 6 is the one and true god. It’s faith. It’s cult.  It’s everything.   Flsirusalen
Sounds yanni
I'd rather have the lambo. It's all about the fun factor. The Porsche is just all about numbers to the point where they take the driver out of the equation. You spend that much money you want to have some fun.
The lambo reving is fire, but the ferrari taking off is nuts
By god's grace all three
Porsche is it
lambo looks and sounds insane.. but that Porsche moves like the North wind.. madly fast, eating expensive cars for breakfast
Every car Mat drives ,loses
YIAANNII I love that dude man he never fails to make me laugh dude is a character😂😂😂😂 he leaned his head forward😂😂😂😂
35.BLACKPINK
We want the 911 turbo s vs gt2 RS please
I’d have the Ferrari
The Porsche with 800 Hp, how fast will be this car?
I'm big fan and from Cardiff but the vote goes to beautiful ferrari just work of art 🇮🇹 sorry lambo :)
Yianni just wants to win! Matt wants to go viral and RIP simultaneously. Who was in the porsche??
Ferrari all the way. Sound, looks. Mental.
Yiannimize was so early off don't think he was there for the "go" 😅 Porsche still beat the bull
That porsche is using magic to win
A voice calls : the car buying comparison site..... To buy a new car! ...........yeahhh .....what did you say the price was. Ohhh 156.000, 262.000 and 360.000 pounds...........😮😮😮😮😮
NISSAN GTR 35 NISMO
I would take the lambo svg just so I could sell it for the most money and buy a Porsche
Yanni's reaction is epic🤣
Dude whats going on with that Porsche that is just madness
Porsche🔥
Porsche, SILENT KILLER
I’d take the…… Porsche. The everyday super car.
The Germans will always try to overpower the Italians
Yanni's a cheat. Always !!!
The 812 actually did pretty well considering RWD.
Lamborghini Aventador svj
Porsche always!
PORSCHE RULES......
(smh) (smh) (smh) that........porsche.
For looks, the 51yr old in me says Ferrari ALL day... if i was 12 yrs old, the Lambo, but actually because i AM 51 i'd probably have the Porsche.... or the ferrari, at my age its more about looking good... 🤣
Porsche all the way! Especially for value
If I had the money.... Aventador!  Love that beast but I'd prefer the regular S.
Ferrari is the fastest. Porsche got lucky off the line...
Farrari
Lambo jumped the start completely on the first race, but the Porsche still won - plus it can launch like that all day long.
Ferrari 100%
Ferrari > Porsche > Lambo
Thanks Matt for making this video possible! ( I commented on previous video of this channel for making a race between 812 superfast V/ Aventador SVJ )  Thanks Again!
Lambo sounds the best, Ferrari looks the best, Porsche drives the best
Ferrari, best-looking and best-sounding of the three.
Porsche - just the best
I have Toyota Corolla 2003
812 was best sounding
I'd have the Ferrari 812 any day money no object
Way to go Porsche. The Bull even jumped the start so he came last in my eyes. !!
It would be nice to see the times for the first race as well :/
ferrari the best ofc
Tutorials on how Germans eating pizzas
Funny that the Porsche has more then 100hp less then both of the others and still destroys them
Which car i would take from those three? Porsche Turbo S, because it's the best allrounder
Porsche For Sure
Porsche all day long, even if I was super loaded. Great car
Porsche
Lambo, just to sell it and buy a 911 Turbo S and keep the change.
Porsche very very fantastic..💪💪💪
The Ferrari is the best looking one, that Lambo tho sounds wicked!
Carroll Shelby had the perfect idea.... put a high horsepower engine in a a lightweight chassis.
Porsche all day mainly because it will just work for eternity and most practical.
"When you buy a Ferrari you only pay for the engine" I loved this bdway. Ferrari fan from India🇮🇳 Ill have some in the future.
Porsche Philosophy: The loudest one in the room is the weakest one in the room.   Love Porsche!!!
Yanny never looks we’re he’s going
Yanni so happy after knowing hes having a baby coming soon❤
Best intro😂😂😂
Lambogini all day, every day😎
I'm here to collect ferrari fan boi tears.
I'd take the 911 please without a doubt. It looks like a sleeper in this one's race. Where both of them are just like flashy ones yadayadayada
I didn't expect the ferrari with its aspirated v12 to go ahead of the 911 on the second roll, the 911 is cool and fast, but my heart beats faster for the ferrari with its v12.
The Lambo is the best looking but I rate the Ferrari sounds better and Porsche is a punisher
No one:  Doug DeMuro: Look mommy! This one is Superfast!
no car in the world puts power to the ground as effectively as porsches, period.
Matt any drag race is incomplete without Yammy
Where there is a lambo, there is a Yanny
I'd get the lambo, sell it and buy the porsche plus a small house...
Porsche any day..
it's a Ferrari pal... :D
Hands down I'd take the Porsche over everything considering what you get for the money. But the best looking of the 3, I'd say goes to the Ferrari. Lambo has too much going on, and Porsche just looks like Porsche (not enough going on).
I watched the intro like 10 times that German accent was super funny
800bhp for what 🤣🤣
Porsche 😍
Porsche. Easy decision.
German engineering in the house.
Germans: Italian cars? ha ha ha ha ha, stick to fashion instead.
the 911
911 all day long.
Put a modern double clutch transmission in the Aventador ,it will eat Ferrari and porsche turbo S for breakfast,,,,
Burch
Porsche all day long.
The Porsche definitely sounded the best
Only lambo svj👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
Money no issue I’d have the Ferrari. Money actually being a problem, I’d have the Porsche 😂
The sound is amazing...   Only one problem... It’s a GT car vs two sports car. Of course they are faster. A pista or something would have been better as it has less drag like the Lambo and the Porsche
Matt is a cheater , always burning the launches...
Definitely the Porsche
Quiet power is the best and great for late night drag racing.
Again and again, 911 Turbo S manages to surprise everything. Absolutely stunning! To be ahead of the best Ferrari and the best Lambo is insane.
Where is the SVJ discount?
Been waiting for an Aventador SVJ vs P911 Turbo S (2020) and you made it even better by adding the 812 Superfast! This is Drag Race Heaven!!!
Are we gonna glaze over the fact Yanny has lost weight.
That Porsche ❤️
I’m aware that this will get lost in the comments but to anyone reading this your not stuck! You can change your situation. No matter how bad you think you have it people have it worse. You can talk about it with us, we’ll accept and support you. Take care and stay safe.😊  Sincerely, @hiddenhustler
Porsche everyday.
porsche.
I would Have the 812 SUPERFAST
Yanni just have to try performante 🤷🏻‍♂️
720s: *King of the rolling races and half miles*  Porsche: *king of 1/4*  Lamborghini: *king of being beat*  Ferrari: *king of being 2nd place*
this is basically cheap car vs expensive car, but little did you know... the Porsche has beaten everyone...
I don't get it, how can you make a car show, but you can't drive?! wtf....
Ferrari makes shit cars now, including the F1 ones.
Porsche WOW 👑🖤
Amazing how no one seems to be able to actually start on go in the standing start drag races
I would take the Lambo, and trade it for two Porshe 911 Turbo S's!😁
Every time.  The Porsches win every video I watch regardless of the channel... Unless it's a lower-spec Porsche versus a higher-spec competitor.  The Lambo will beat a 2WD Carrera, fine.  But nothing touches that 911 Turbo.  It ran a 10.1 in a previous video.  Just, right off the dealer's lot stock running a 10.1 and beating electrics and whatever else.  It used to take thousands of dollars of modification and trick engineering to get a car to 10.1 and now a stock 911 does it.  It's expensive, but also a bargain in comparison.  Porsche is one of the great brands on Earth where you get what you pay for.  Expensive but reliable and consistent.  You're not just paying for a name, the engineering and quality back it up.  I watched a GT2RS on Gumbal race every supercar you can imagine on an airstrip probably in Switzerland or Germany.  It raced all day and never lost.  Bugatti, Pagani, Noble, Lamborghini, AMG, Ferrari, McLaren... It beat every car it raced- even the RUFs!  Porsches are the finest cars in the world. And I drive an AMG.
Porsche is the best! 🦅🖤
Lambo guy jumps the start in every video. Video after video. And then considers it a win every time. ...stupid.
PORSCHE rules forever!!!!
Wonder how the Porsche would do against those two on a track
At I thought the Ferrari had a carbon fiber finish on The Whole body. It was just my fingerprints 😑
SVJ😍👌🏻
Lamborghini aventador sj
id have the 812 Superfast cos its got hypercar speed yet it doubles up as a GT car so I can do them epic drives across Europe. Also, the V12 in that car sounds better than the Aventador,
Lamborghini sounds so good
There's no way to compare the Porsche 911 Turbo S with any other car! It's RIDICULOUS what it is capable of! At one third of the price!
The intro thooo
The Porsche tough.  King Slayer..
Enzo and Ferrucio be like "oooh we fast, we expensive, we cool ".   Ferdinand be like "coughs in 911 turbo S"
Svj best looking but that porsche is a beast on the track
Lambo for live ☺️
When a flat six wins against two v12 !
Fun fact : Yanni doesn't want to win. He just wants to beat Mat
superfast
SVJ
Money no object, I'd take the 812.
Porsche that car that can be extremely expensive but worth it yet a bargain all In one lol gotta love that German engineering.
812 Superfast? They should have chosen the Sf90 stradale.
Ferrari sound is better . According to me   I love it very much .it sounds like formulae one cae
the Porsche punished the vaunted Ferrari and Lamborghini 😀
The Porsche is like that kid in your math class who is smart without even trying
Use the shift paddles!!! Launch control!!!
*SVJ*
Lambo😇😇
You can lease the Porsche for 1340 € a month inkl. 10k km a year / no downpayment in Germany ... Lamborghini 4k, Ferrari 3,7k ... ;)
Matt jumped the start on the second try 😂
that porsche is like the quiet kid in the class while the two other is the noisy kids xD
The Porsche Turbo S my Favorit 👌
If only the porsche would look good it would be an amazing car, but well, lambo was the best looking
Why does that ferrari not have a indicator?
The race is all about yanni and matt
LOVE PORSHE🎃
SVJ
When I saw yianny i got a big smile on my face hahaha
And in the end, the germans win
If only the porsche would look good it would be an amazing car, but well, lambo was the best lookinh
Ferrari
porsche porsche porsche what a car.you have lambo for 360 k but you know porsche faster then you
porsche of course guys!!! :) a daily car .....
Why is that Ferrari so cheap in UK
All day any day, it's Lamborghini ❤️
11:33 the Porsche driver looks soo accomplised xDD
I’ll still get the Porsche!!
How can this porsche, win every single races so EASILY ???!!!
I would have the Ferrari 812 superfast
Hardly surprised, after the perfect start from yannie and SVJ is also AWD...i was pretty much sure the Lambo would win the Drag Race by at least a half car length. Sound wise i think there is no doubt: Lambo is the clear winner. The sound is amazing. But the Porsche got a little better sound, if the sport exhaust is installed and the flaps are open.
Tht Porsche went like a rocket never underestimate the power of German cars
That 911 Turbo is no joke , just half the price , damnnn
Ferrari  6.5L Naturally Aspirated V12 800 HP 717 Nm 7 speed DCT Rear wheel drive 1744 kg 2,62,000 pounds  Lambo 6.5L Naturally Aspirated V12 770 HP 720 Nm 7 speed AT All Wheel Drive 1525 kg 3,60,000 pounds  Porsche 3.8L twin turbo Flat Six 650 HP 800 Nm 8 speed DCT All Wheel Drive 1640 kg 1,56,000 pounds     I always found myself going back and forth the video to compare the specs. So I just put it up like this so that if anyone else felt the way I did could just read it at once.
Porsche, but then again I’ve always loved the Porsche. The best car at the best price! If only I could afford to buy one, haha. Maybe in my next life.
The porsche
i'll pick the SF90 over the Lambo. But the 812 bonnet is way too long.
Ferrari 812 Superfast is my Dream car
Sound goes to the SVJ, but I'd rather have two 911 Turbo S than the SVJ and the Ferrari isn't even a consideration.
I'll have the Porsche 911 all day everyday !!💜😎
Turbo s no brainer
PORSHE, EHRFURCHT GEBIETEND!
The best thing is that we can hear ‘3,2,1’ despite the sound of these cool cars
Does it get any better ❤️love this channel
This video just proves that the louder you are doesn’t make you the fastest. An extra $100k for louder farting sounds lol
porsche, sorry for lambo and ferrari, but porsche is just on another level
Porsche: 🤫🤫🤫
FERRARI was lazy designing the 812 it's UGLY!! an it's an UGLY I CANT AFFORD LOL! The F1 TDF shoulda been been the successor. BTW lower priced PORSCHE TURBO IS A STEAL$$$$!!!
I think porsche sounds the best 😌💆🏿‍♂️
that yianize is a full on cheat, cheats in a race and in life
The Lambo
I still get the ferrari its the best...but the porsche is a monster.
Porsche any day of the week
On the first go, it looks like the Lambo was tied with the Porsche
Lambo svj
Hell yeah that SVJ!
Let's talk about the fact that SVJ didn't win shit🤣
BMW X6M Comp. vs the Urus...
Porsche any day of the week, Porsche fan  boys rejoice
Yanni - cheater
This bromance kills 🔥💪
Svj
I love the Aventador SVJ
Lamborgini aventador svj
Lamborghini aventador svj  Lambo all day every day
Ferrari is better looking than the lambo
YANNI BEGAN EARLIER
The one and only 911 Turbo S
I love gtr track back but the porsche 911 turbo s - is another level ❤️😈
Porsche is like the quite kid in the class..
If one is secure in one's sexuality and manhood, it HAS to be Porsche. There is no substitute... #RealCarForRealMen
Porsche 🙋🏻‍♂️🥰🚀
Tell you what that Ferrari would blast both with a slight mod of including 4 wheel drive to makeup for weight issues by adding functional weight.. Porsche is my fav but that Ferrari was just too close for comfort against all wheel drive beasts.
German quality?
the thing is the super fast and the SVJ are the flagships if the porsche was a GT2 RS it would have beat both by 5+ seconds every time
Definitely the Porsche for me
I’d take the Porsche because AWD and fuel efficiency over these two also price
Svj all day long
I think the Ferrari looks the best, Lamborghini sounds the best, but I’d prefer the Porsche what a beaut
Yanni jumped the first start and Mat jumped the second.
If i could buy i would choose lambo bcz of it looks and sound  But Porsche 911 is my dream car😍
Turbo s is nice 😃😄😄😁
I’ll take that Porsche any day. Best visibility, most comfortable, more affordable, best winter performance, super car killer!
I would have 720s
I’ll still take the Lambo all day. It’s a beauty 😍
Don't care about the results... Ferrari all day, every day.
Pls do 720s vs svj and Porsche
Porshe 911
Please review the 2021 BMW 5 Series
Porsche svj superfast is what I'd prefer
I’d like to see the 992 Turbo S dyno test...
Porsche but get fbo and tuned...
Lamborghini
Porsche 911 turbo s 992. Best car in the f world.
Porsche purebred stallion!!!
Defo the Lambo.
The superfast is the nicest one
The 911...
The 911 is a bargain in this company. That or the super fast. I prefer the hurican which is quicker in a drag race on this channel.yianni always jumps the start on any drag race.
Yianni's vibes are so good😂❤
Why don’t you test this with a Porsche GT2 RS? That would have been the same class of like „crazy mode“  like you have with the SVJ.  That would be very interesting to be honest.
Ferraris getting caught cheating in F1 has trickled down to  its road cars.... No longer quick LOL
And its not even the GT2 RS..Porsche is King !
Svj for sure
I'd get the Lambo, sell it, buy the Porsche. Then with the remaining money, buy another Porsche. And be the fastest.
Yanni you filthy cheat! Love it 😂
that Porsche is mental
for drama & performance #1 tied with lambo & ferrari  #3 porsche
Porche for life
Ferrari sounds the best
Porsche
Porsche was like a virus per se, quite but a killer.
Lamborghini
Like if Mat should only talk in the accent of the car he is driving's origin from now on
Porsche
I honestly was hoping that the Lambo would win the 1/4 mile coz I don't want some Porsche with soft limiter being being the drag king.
Before the video starts I gonna say the porsche is wining
Now lets wait for the GT2 RS.....
Mat never disappoints with the contents
I would just have the Lambo just to make some DRAMA NOISE...!
Lambo for the looks (looks fast even tho not the fastest) Ferrari for the Iconic and faster than the Lambo (sometimes) Porsche for the if it aint broke don't fix it, yet still beating the others in a drag, with a very old design, you always know it's a Porsche instantly, the downside for me is I cannot tell the difference between them until you go a fair way back, the Lambos xan be a bit samey as theres probably only 3 distinct modelchanges (to an untrained eye)
It must be a struggle going back to reviewing every-day cars after this...
Well VW > Audi > Fiat
V12 vs.V12 vs. =6= 3.8 turbo
Porsche❤💆🏿‍♂️
Farary
My boss has a svj, he doesn’t like it!
It could be awesome if he review a Lamborghini
Porsche ALL DAY
Porsche
Ferrari TPMS can act a bit iffy and flash up errors due to interference from phones (and I assume walkie talkies). Had the same problem with my 488. Just needs to go back to dealer for a reset.
Porsche is just a monster.
Should have put the Matt in the Porsche and see Yianni cry all the way back to Cardiff!
Ferrari 812
Best car? Definitely the PORSCHE, for you two fanboys...
Porsche 12 Pts. !
Any day that starts with Yianni LOSING is a good one... multiple losses are even better. A whimpering, defeated Yianni? A gift from God.
Looks wise out of those three,  Definitely the Ferrari. But I Would want the Porsche for everyday use.  Plus it thrashes the other two Italian, cars.
Yianni: Lets talk about the Bull beating the Horse...   The Horse still won because there is a Horse on the Badge of a Porsche too...
Svj
All hail Porsche engineers !!
That Ferrari sounds amazing tho
I am NOT a Porsche guy but my GOD that is VERY respectful.. what a bloody beast.
We must learn from Porsche: talk less....do more!
Lambo all day
If you want to win a (track)race then take the Porsche but if you want to show off then an italian sportscar
Ferrari  all day
That Porsche is just AMAZING!!!
porcshe absolutely
Great drag race but please ADD 0-60 times!👍
I would buy Ferrari 812
Ferrari is of course the best looking car Holly shit its a masterpiece
Porsche: Making Italy cry for decades
After seeing this, in terms of performance and price, I'm gonna have to go with the Porsche 911 Turbo S on this one🤝. But in terms of looks and sound, Lamborghini Aventador SVJ will do it, hands down👐...
Video starts at 5:20
porche is the real super car here i’m team 911!
All hail the almighty six cylinder! Bow down and worship, peasants!
Id rather have the porche. Jjst a echaust and a tune and she'll scream.
You don’t even have to watch this and you know what will win
Would go with the Porsche 😍
🔥🔥🔥
Yanni jumped and the porsche still won 🤣🤣
Ferrari all day, everyday. But the 911 is a Supercar Killer.
Why is the Porsche being ignored? Smashed both Lambo and Ferrari 😅
Ferrari 812 superfast
That dude is way too much.
El porsche esta supercargado??
Ferrari anytime
Use me as a "this is the best dr ever button"
911 all day.
K im sorry to triger half the people here but i hate the sound of Lambo V12s. Even if they sounded good to me i wouldnt buy one cuz it overrated.
812superfast
porsche 992 turbo S is an assassin !
Porche porche porche......Ist beautiful, perfect
I love lambos but damn that porsche is a monster.... I would probably buy one...
Germany beybi 🙂
The thing is the porsche is probably also the most reliable out of the 3
These drag races are so ass, none of these guys know how to drive.
Porsche 911 turbo s for sure
The accents were spot on.
I would for sure go for the Porsche I love the brand it is the cheapest and according to this the best. Just would need a new exhaust.
Lambo is the looker!! Com on!!  Great vid as always 💯
Ferrari
you should re-do this witha ferrari f8 or sf90, the 812 isn't the best one
Ferrari over Lambo all day everyday but nothing beats McLaren.
I would go for the 812 superfast, even if it’s 100,000 pounds more than the SVJ, and the turbo... yeah
Yanni jumped the first race
Porsche
Lamborghini is only busy doing their design
Porsche 911 turbo s is THE MOST AMAZING MACHINE ever created by the Germans.... And I would take it any day. ❤️
911s are mad fast but the sound of the svj is just 🤤
Porsche
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ but not this colour 😅
I just adore the video!
Yanni’s biggest jump start yet!  Or, Matt was just really ordinary
MAT vs YIANNI  🏇🏇🏇☑️        #Really Horse Power 🙌🙌🙌
Hands down Porsche 911 Turbo S‼️
i love your video's, but please make it 60 fps :)
get on a circuit track see if you can actually drive
Ferrari
812
Porsche ❤️
Crazy how "slow" the Porsche is from a rolling start.
Porsche
I would take the Porsche. Love the smooth look. But there is space for all these cars. All great.
911 turbo s - best value for money compared to the SVJ and 812
Porsche definitely!
911 all day long, as it has been for the last 40 years.
Hahaha! Yianni does not care what happens so long as he beats Mat! That Porsche tho... 🤯
That v 12 tho is unreal
I'd have the Porsche out of these 3
I havent watch yet but porsche is porsche ahahah first
Lambo for me if money was no object ! Looks great fun to drive
Lol wtf that accent
Porsche just don't care..
The porsche is fucking fast!!
The Ferrari
I’ll take the Porsche anyday!
Porsche
the super faaaaaasttt
I’d have the Porsche. Most people can’t tell the difference between a base 911 and any of the higher end models. I think you’d have a better chance of flying under the radar. Which is one of the main reasons I daily a Golf R. Plus the turbo is just begging for a tune and a few other choice goodies. Most people into turbo cars know just how amazing the turbo responds to simple but good mods. It would be fairly easy to drop those 1/4 mile times down to high if not mid 9s. I absolutely adore the Lambo and Ferrari. Their works of art. I just wouldn’t want the added attention while driving them. I had a heavily modded Evo 8 that I bought when they first came to the states and constantly had young fellas fallow me to gas stations to talk about the car. I also had one of the only R33 GTRs in the states that was also extremely modded. That was in 2005-2007 for the 33. I couldn’t drive anywhere without having everyone try to race me and of course fallow me to check the car out. That’s why the Golf R has been perfect and I think the 911 turbo S would be similarly low key. Otherwise who wouldn’t want to own a piece of art like the other two cars.
Cars Like 👹👹🤡
How the f... does the porsche winn? Two to three times less expensive, two times less cylinders, less power, less torque, more weight than the Lambo.  😎 german engineering 😎
I'd pick the  Ferrari 812 Superfast because it's a grand tourer much more comfortable for long journeys and you won't be doing drag race on the motorway so you'd smoke everyone.
Matt: let’s say in comments which car sounds best...  The comments: Porsche is the GOAT
Damn that Porsche is fast!!! 200hp less and half the cylinders and capacity. Still beat the V12 supercars.
Best drag race ever
If Mat or Yanni drove the Porsche then it would do the 1/4 mile for 10.1.
Porsche RIPPED Yannis ass!
Jumpyanny
Ferrari looks the best!  But the Porsche...!
I would take the 🐎
5:40 Yanni: Oh the Porsch... kill the Ferrari tho. Like well the Porsche is gone but let me kill at least Mat in the Ferrari 😂
I would totaly have the superfast love how it looks and sounds and everything
The lambo svj all the way
Im going 1st Ferrari 2st lamporgini in the bed i will take the most beautiful girls who screaming best... maybe when i get old i married and be with the same girl for 20 years and be logical i will take that porche bring me 0.2 dollars more in the pocket but i will never forget the first 2 ladies. The most important about super cars was made make you filling young again thats why Tim and Gianni was in those 2 cars.
812 superfast
Thats one evolved Bugg.
I think the Porsche is the best looking car here both in terms of interior, exterior and it's performance is seriously sick......what an engineering ❤️❤️❤️
Ferrari all day long 👍
That Porsche is just unreal, so fast.
Yianni doesn’t need to beat porsche🤣 its all against matt
Porche
Yea I still want the Ferrari...but with all red interior
Lambo any day
None I'd rather have a Ferrari f40
I'd want 812 but that spec you are driving
Day to day - 911 Turbo S. To show off and make a lot of noise - Aventador SVJ. To have fun - Ferrari 812.
Turbo S
ferrari
Loved this race
If money was no object, I would still go for the Porsche... I love everything about it, even its understated looks.
For the price the porsche
porsche better..
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ 63💓💓
Ferrari won because is not a 4 WD
Listen here, that 2020 turbo s is no fuckin joke
Damn that SVJ is loud as hell.
A for effort Matt
This 911 is just a masterpiece!
I'd have the SVJ purely based on the sound alone, also because it looks great and is mental fast too
No change!! Long live the 911
Notice they never bring the 720s to the party.Nooe car wow Diane twant it's German sponsors getting embarrassed
10:16 is like in F1 in every race :-)
Ferrari all the way
812 ss
The lambo is the best looking, period!
Have to be the loudest drag race I ever hear in carwow . Holy cow 😂 super cool race
The humble sounding, Tesla eating, unbeatable, Porsche wins the race.       Again.
Aventador Essaveejay
812 super fast
Porsche all day every day
I would go for the 992
Money no object, 2 of that Porsche in different colours.
Porsche
Come on Matt this is the worst fake italian accent ever heard
The 812 is my dream car but that svj is damn beautiful
Yanni jumps his starts every time! (or he's got epic reaction speeds)
Money no object and I would still have the porsche.   Lambo is for posters or if you are trying to compensate for a size issue.
I wish you had a 720S thrown in the mix as well.
When Porsche takes the term "sleeper" too seriously 4:18
SuperFast means you have to be fasting when you drive for weight reduction
El 6 cilindros les gana a todos jaja
Mat!!! What color are the  Porsche's seatbelts? 🤔
RARI ❤️🐎
Porsche all day!!!!
If I had to choose a car I would have the Lamborghini svj then sell it to get the Porsche
Love that nobody focused on the Porsche just Yianni vs Matt
A Dyson beat a Ferrari and a Lamborghini Porsche power!!
I would own the Ferrari if money was no object. It has the best sounding V12.
911 is the beast!!!
Matt, Yianni, would you guys just merge your Youtube channels already, both of you know that, you get better results, working together, than separate
Porsche
Ferrari
The Porsche!! No more words needed.
RWD every day 🏆☀️☀️☀️☀️☀️
Matt when you are driving a Ferrari don’t do stupid nonsense accent, please be decent
F12 superfast 😎
yanni!!!! Hilarious #getthrough
Lambo.....the Porsche looks like a deflated VW beetle.....Porsche is FUGLY.
Porsche is simply the best
Yanny is crazy competitive. Every single race on this channel, he really really wants to win every time. I mean not like want to win, but felt insulted if he doesn't. Hilarious!
ferrari v12 sound all day!!! soz yanni, not soz
Ferrari 812 🥇🥇🏆🏆🏆🤩🤩🤩
Definetly Porsche...
I would have the Superfast (superpanda)
porsche 911 turbo s for a mileeee i would have that car for shure.
The Porsche ... Easy!!!
812 sounds the best
I´d take the Porsche every day
Yianni didn’t use corsa so he didn’t paddle shifters
Ferrari 812 superfast
Fararrie 812 superfast
Drag race a Ferrari f40
The Ferrari looks way better it looks dope in black too
I know the Porsche is a better car but I’ll take that lambo any day
guys check ferrari 812 superfast novitec sound and you will get orgasm literally xd
I'll have the Porsche thank you
Lamborghini❤️
Porsche
Do like these drag race vids. Simple and to the point.. good entertainment
Porcha fr ever
this is the best drag race ever prob the best in the UK
Should’ve been a GT2 or GTRS.
If it is cheap it is the best :)))
Obviously there is a kind of magic in the 911. Less horse power, more weight, but still..
The accents where VERY entertaining imo.💯😂
Ferrari
Money no object id still pick the porshe... ive come to love things that don't shout "look at me I have a small willy"!
Yani is  anti-talent for driving
Ferrari all the way
People will love to have a Porsche..
The Porsche is a sports car, the Lamborghini and the Ferrari are supercars. Supercars are not dull, plain and quiet.
Porsche FTW! Giant slayer🤟🤟🤟
Lambo sounds better
10:52 when you borrow your friends stuff and something happens to it 😂
I would defintely have the Porsche, is it really a question?
The Lambo gets spanked everytime 🤣
The Lambo would be fastest easy if it was a Dual Clutch.... But noooo
Porsche all the way , im ok with my own porsche also
WOW! Just imagine when Porsche comes out with it's 992 GT2RS or when the 992.2 Turbo S comes out with a slight boost in horsepower (as is custom)
Next race-Porsche 911 Turbo S vs GT2RS VS GT3RS vs Taycan Turbo S
Porchea 911turbos money for value
Turbo S vs GT2RS vs GT3RS?
Hey Mat, the Lamborghini has a single clutch automated manual because it is way lighter than a dual clutch that the Ferrari has, and the Lamborghini is also way more spartan than the Ferrari, so it would be lighter
LAMBO! Don't care how fast the Porsche is! The Lambo has a presence! Sounds great looks great, love that V12!
Porsche
I would have the Aventador
That Porsche is insane!
THE PORSCHE DON'T NEED SHIT LIKE V12 OR 6.1. THE PORSCHE WAS. IS AND WILL THE GOD OF THE FAST CARS. THANKS A LOT GOD FOR MADE THE GERMAN CARS 😍😙
Porsche sounds hilarious
Can we get that model S vs the 911 turbo please...we know what's gonna happen but we just want it on vid...
My moms 2013 Town & Country sounds better than the Porsche
And the porshe won what the hell didnt see that coming
I'd go Ferrari for sure. That 812 is a marvel
Porsche
Porsche any day
Ferrari: 😦 Lambo: 😐 Porsche: 🤭
Meh, would still get the Ferrari.
What a beast is that Porsche, I love it
SVJ
the car with the best launch control wins the 1/4 mile the fastest wins the rolling race
Porsche is the best
Sorry but it would be the Porsche for me, I know the Lamborghini and Ferrari sound great but that Porsche is a savage
If someone give me the option of have the lambo, sell it, buy the Porsche and a house 🤣
I want the performance and results of a Porsche 911 Turbo S inside the body of that Ferrari, sorry lambo but the ferrari has a better relaxed but terrifying look, lambo is just to pure aggression from looks, would scare my daughter haha. I own the 911 tho and she calls it butters the horse?
О чем говорят на понятно, но смотреть все равно интересно. Включите титры на русском)
For those of us who like to be discreet, I'll take the Porsche. Thank you 😊
Porsche. It's clearly the better all rounder.
The entire Aventador line is broken
Porsche seems to spank every supercar's butt on the track.  Kind of boring.  Next video should be three compact sedans from Toyota, Nissan and Mazda. We need some unpredictability.
I'd still want the SVJ
The Porsche in unbelievable
@producermichael and the 720s just lost to the 911 for a bit, so I guess it is still faster than the 812 lol.
Thumbs up to the Porsche's driver 911 clearly stole the show
So bad he can't hear me imitating the British accent as a German!
That the Porsche is insane I never inspect this
Gotta be the 911 turbo s
Porsch 👍
Porsche of course 😎
Porsche is definitely geared for acceleration on the first four gears but eventually wears out on the stretches. It was similar against a Mclaren 720s and with proper tires the Mclaren should take the Porsche even from a standing quarter mile.
love and respect to Yanni. But would buy a Ferrari. Unless its a Lamborghini Sesto Elemento.
Imagine when they start tuning that new turbo s.   O.o
Porsche
Porsche 911 Turbo S all day
Que granda maquina esse Porshe
Absolutely I am gone have  Ferrari 🥰
Porsche Is the best 🤪😂😂
Lambo all day!!!!!!
Lambo: Brakes Ferrari: Breaks
The rarri got it on the sound test
the ugly moment when porsche brings out the 918 successor...
The thing is Lambo vs Ferrari is not so direct comparison as one would think. One is quite a luxury GT car and one is special limited track version. It's interesting to see which one is faster and all, but they are so different it doesn't actually matter. :D If I wanted car for roadtrips I would buy Ferrari and if I wanted a track day toy or something just for short fun rides I would pick Lambo.
Yanni cheated big time 5:20
i would have the porsche
if a 911 Turbo S is in a drag video, it wins.  Just understand this as one of the few internet laws
Ferrari for looks but Porsche to own. Neither of which I’ll ever afford.
Porsche 911 Turbo S!!! SPEED MONSTER ONLY ONE ☝️
I don't think nobody wanted the porsche to win lol.
spoiler alert:  many jump starts
If money wouldn't be a problem Lamborghini but without that graphics, black, green or red. How's the Ferrari not red? That Porsche is surprisingly fast. I wonder what would be faster around the track like Hockenheim or Mugello.
Man, love this one. But the commercials! Too many! But that Porsche, kills you with silence.
Porsche 911 Turbo S Hands down. For the price and the car you get. . . . easy choice.
Yanni purposely is running on a low fuel tank just so he can be even lighter... 😂😂😂
For sure the Porsche is the best and being a Porsche fanboy it looks the best too
I always appreciated Porsche as a brand, but always lusted over the Italians. I’ve recently been able to get a lot of wheel time in a 991 Turbo S Cabriolet. The Italians just don’t make sense any more.
Ferrari batmobile
Think ooaff zdat youtube money! 😂
the porshe was so quite someone would think as if it was coughing
Go McLaren Senna
Super fast if money is no issue
The Porsche is the one - definitely the best car!
Lamborghini aventador yeaaaaa
Your freakin' accent is damn accurate
Porsche any day. Would be the easiest to live with too and stupidly quick
Porsche 911 Turbo S
porsche is the best
Ferrari
Always Porsche
the porsche has been my dream car since it was in spy shots. i was really excited when you guys did the race vs the mclaren, and the porsche winning just made it better. also the porsche sounded the best
Next generation Lamborghini I want a dual clutch transmission
if I could have any of them Ferrari for me. However in the real world the Porsche just makes the most sense, its the better car, better price, and still an elegant looking car, plus when you can finally get an inconnel exhaust for it then it will sound good too.
Ain’t it funny how it’s perfectly acceptable to do an Italian or a German accent but if he was to do an African accent this video would’ve never been uploaded 😂
If I had to pick one of these. It’s the Ferrari 812. Way more classy and subtle. The Lambo is like a step child always trying to be loud to get attention.
Lamborghini aventador s vs aventador sv vs aventador svj
Porsche 911 turbo s
Porsche of course
German engineering meine Freunde
The Ferrari is the best looking but the Porsche is the best vehicle in the video
You should clearly bring a Porsche 911 gt3 rs or gt2 rs next time!!!
I want to take the Porsche
Always Porsche, Porsche for The Win! The perfection
Porsch overall even looks the best
Germany always be the King 👑🔥🔥🔥
11:33 Porsche man is happy
OMG!  I cannot believe you have these 3 cars all together.  I'm sitting here at my computer trying to get the "Balls" to watch the race because I know nothing for the rest of the year from anyone else is going to be more exciting to me than this race.  Thanks a $ million or so!!  I can't wait any longer.  Here I go...............
Porshe tycan
How about that Ferrari Reliability folks!!
Porsche has me... They keep winning.
8:39 I think Porsche look beautiful
I wonder why the Porsche did so poorly in the locked gear rolling race. I guess it just suffered from high speed due to the aero being better on the other cars?
Lamborghini bc... yk... lambo 😎
I would get the lambo. It's a bloody BEAST
What a car the Porsche 991 turbo S is. Such impressive performance
I would cop the Ferrari 812 Superfast , Superfast!!😂😂
Porsche all day......svj is just a pimped up old aventador
Porsche King Kong Check out my latest video 💪
Porsche or the Ferrari
Forza Ferrari
Svj
Porsche
It might be slow, but that NA V12 sound is worth every fucking penny !
Lol Yianni's movements in the car while drifting is funny.
Yanni jumped the first start again.
If this is the Porsche 911 what will be the next GT2rs
911 all the way.
The dynamic duo, love it... yewwww
DEUTSCHLAND
the day lambo puts a dct in a big body v12 it's over for these other manufactures, it's astonishing how they've got rings records and more than respectable straight line speed with single clutch configuration😥😭
Love your videos. They are all very entertaining and Yianni is a riot to watch. However, after years of these comparisons, I fully believe that Porsche has the best combination for stable maximized performance. I am not a Porsche fan by any means, but facts are facts. Of these 3 I'd have the Ferrari.
The SVJ is the pick of the bunch
Daily driver 812 weekend SVJ
Can’t imagine if the superfast has 200kg less weight...
Performance wise, theres a blink of an eye in it really. But with the eye wide open, the 812 is simply stunning! Porsche is in sheepskin clothing, with the Lambo too boy racer- ish. Value for money tho, it's the German marque all day long.
Out of those three, I'm taking the 812.
Porsche for sure
911
Porsche is the King end stey the King
I would have the porshe turbo s
Mat you are a legend bruh
The porsche is the better car, quality-price
Porsche is a beast💪
Porsche is in a different league
Looks: Ferrari Sound: Lamborghini Usability and better buy: Porsche  Just imagine what will happen with Porsche in same price range, the 992 GT3, GT3 RS and then GT2 RS... sub 10s time for sure
Ferrari or Porsche
Wait for the 812 GTO with more power, less weight and a new 8 speed DCT..
Porsche: All day, everyday
Germans are simply the best❤
Sorry lambo fanboys,but literally every super cars has beaten Aventador on carwow😂😂
Ferrari looks the best but I'd have the porsche.
Is the Lambo misfiring @7:13 because its not the limiter that i am sure of,
Best drag race yet!
NA V12s clearly can't compete with twin turbos, next gen should be shockingly fast.
Wow I didn't expect that from the ferrari
Ciao bella
Lambo all day!
What do call an Intalian with a rubber toe??
Mat we want a real  SVJvs488pistavs720s Yianni vs Mat vs anyone
Ferrari v12 sounds the best
Lambo
8:03 "not quite superfast enough" 💀💀
Svj
Porsche !!!!!!
I vote for the Porsche I would buy the Porsche
I think we all love seeing Yianni lose lmao
Aventador SvJ
Porsche the silent killer....... all the managers laughing cause everyone saying how silent it is in a rev match.
I would definitely vote Porsche 911 it just destroy the two supercars silently and It looks great for me...911 for life
Good job porsche
Got to be the Porsche Matt 😉
Love Turbos. Id take one all day long over the others and smile that it doesnt need to shout either. Oh. STOP GOING ON ONE YIANNI.
Porsche every day in life
Porsche sounds the best and I'd pick Porsche 911 over those two anytime.
Ferrari
Race with a Bugatti
Porsche ADL
I’d have  1. Ferrari because of Looks 2. Porsche for speed  3. Lambo because it’s a Lambo
Lamborghini SVJ
Can we have race between Porsche 911 turbo s, lamborghini huracan performante probably r8 plus or mclaren 720s
The Porsche had the best sound
Ok but wheres the 765lt
Porsche go nyoom
The more I watches these videos the more I fall in love with Porsche. 911 Turbo S all the way!
Porsche for me and pocket the change!
If it had a dcg it the lambo wooo Ik ls definitely win
Guys you’re always jumping the porches but still it’s beat the hill out of you.
911 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
hahahahahahah that accent kiiiiilled me, brooo that was soooooo funny!!!!
Lambo is just for flex
The Porsche is absolutely epic🙏🏼🙏🏼 German Engineering❤️❤️🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
Turbo S is the ultimate sleeper. Love it!
I want to see a Koenigsegg Agera in one of these videos!!
Porsche 911 turbo S
The Porsche is just insane
Porsche all day
please make the same race with one more car (a stock GT-R) 'cause i need to shut up one friend who says the GT-R is better than Porsche 🙏  other suggestion: instead of Turbo S put GT2 RS and 720S/765LT 🥵
PORSCHE 911 TURBO S.........THE ONLY SUBSTITUTE IS.........ITSELF.
Aventador SJV!!!!
For clubbing and getting thots, Ferrari. Lambo also works.
When are guys bringing the Lamborghini chentinario?
Ferrari
Pa cuando el español
PorschE... not "Porsch"... wat the fuck is a Porsch?
Consider this:  Back when the P100D trolled the super cars, they made the focus on the Tesla.  Now when the 911 is trolling the super cars, the focus is on everyone else.  Where's the glory Porsche deserves?  Sincerely, Porsche fanboy
German cars give home work to all car company , dont be funny bkz no cars can do what German cars  to be honest .( Germans  vs  All )
Maybe the best engineering car ! Porsche 911
Lambo all day everyday 😍😍😍
812 for that legendary v12
812 for sure
I’d love either the Ferrari or the Porsche.  Don’t like the Lambo’s looks at all.  Give me a Huracan Performante from Lambo instead.  Really need that and a 488 Pista from Ferrari to go at this Porsche.
the 911 beats the taycan ☝️
Matt on the 2nd run you jumped before the hands dropped
Ferrari 812 SF, the best engine currently on any car
I'll take the Porsche pls
Porsche is the cheapest in this race
12:05 ofcourse lamborgini and Yianni is right it is a mile far better
which of them? nop...porsche carrera gt :D
I cracked at the intro.🤣
I'm waiting for a video in which the tuned supra mk4 will compete against supercars
I focking hate when the Porsche is neglected bcz its OBVIOUS FAST. Come on, it's a beast. Say it
0:04 no te sale el Alessandro Salomondrini prro
Well I know the outcome of this without watching it.
This channel has the best drag races
812 superfast, that v12 sounds better, not louder!
Yianni with the jump, as always
The 812 super fast
812
The Porsche is what the 720 S was for a while.....A giant killer on the strip but costs even less
Lol that Porsche is friggin insane. 👍 Price + Speed : Porsche is King Looks + Sound : Lambo is the 👑  Poor performance overall : That Ferrari
6:05 is how everyone feels when there is yianni
0:15 I must say I think the 911 looks really good!
I love the Adventador, but the 911 turbo s.... what a machine! 😎
The v12 sound solid and rumbly inside the car but sound like as if they have a tin can as on exhaust when revved while stationary.... Oh wait...
that's a fast VW Beetle
911 BY FAR
Yianni makes the show
812 all day long
Porsche, always.
_"Vee don't like to shout about our performance but vee will crush zem"_  😆
Porsche 100% sounds the best... when it's blasting down the street and I'm trying to fucking sleep
5:06 Gun shots
Can we have all the aventador race Aventador s vs sv vs svj vs roadster  Nd for once in my lifetime before i die i wanna see sesto elemento vs porsche turbo s on any channel
7:25 Come on! Git FREW! Git FREWW!!!  Hahahah. Yanni's reactions are legendary!
Please do a GTR vs LFA vs NSX
Porsche 991 is clearly a violation of Geneva Convention of 1949. Mad scientist I tell you.
12:03 i would have an 812 thank you very much
I don’t know why but I love that porche
I wanna see the GT2 RS
Ferrari 100%%%%
This is the best!! Better than top gear. Plus the car reviews are done properly and then you’ve got the drag races with similar bhps from different makes and I love this show Mat is a good presenter keep up with your hard work I’m loving it!!
Svj
LAMBO!!!!!!!!!!!!
Ferrari any day of the century
Race starts at 5:20..🏁      You are welcome 🤘✌️
Porsche be like: am first, not that nobody cares
No he visto el video y ya se que ganó el porshe! Soy amante de Ferrari pero a ese porshe no hay quien le gane!
Porsche is all about smart engineering, no bullshit here. And no need to pay so much money
I would have the Porsche, the only one who’s owner has legal number plates!
That Porsche tho.. Subtle and fast asf!
Porshe is the best car there ongoing
The Lamborghini has presence & sound like nothing else on Earth. The porsche might as well just be a hybrid. No passion at all.
Definitely the Ferrari! 🔥
I don't know but for some reason everyday I am waiting for a drag race from Carwow when I get home. And there..right on the top I see some really nice asses above a blue Carwow logo. Heaven!!
Lol Yianni and Matt should have their own car show 😆
Lamborghini
The 911 is just incredible!
Salutation to Porsche 🙋🏻‍♂️😎👍✌️ with half cylinders, less power less torque, more weight yet the AWD SVJ couldn’t win niether the drag nor the brake rounds
It’s always the quite ones you gotta look out for
All three!!!!
Lambo 4 sure
Porsche ftw
I think the porsche gt2 rs is faster than the turbo s, so we can say that porsche is the fastesat cad
I think the Ferrari does sound better! Love the tone of that car
That accent tho👍👍👍😅
MATJANI VALTER 👑💨🔥
911 turbo s all day everyday
812 sf
How many adverts!? I'm 5 mins in and there have been 6 ads already
911 TurboS all the way :)
That fucking porsche is an unbeatable machine, dont want to see the future GT2 RS...
porsche sounded the best no doubt about it xd
TBH Ferrari looks the best SVJ sounds the best and is the most showy car And Porsche just launches faster, but looks kinda meh imo  So if I had an unlimited amount of money, I’d get a Ferrari.
Bro, I want som much a drag race with the 911 GT2 RS, please
Lambo sounds great. But the Ferrari's sound is so unique👌
Financially go with Porsche.. sound and the look go for Lamborghini.. classy and name go for Ferrari... up to your category
I would like to have all three :P
What the Germans have done with the new Porsches is just insane, it's like magic
Lamborghini is the best
I'd have the lambo
Looks : Lambo speed: porsche sound: Lambo
Ferrari must me red ❤️❤️not black
Porsche for ever....
SVJ: Best Sound 812:  I’d rather have the 812 if money was no option 911: was just the chaperon
Porsche ❤
and if they make a video of the aventador svj vs huracan performante vs ferrari 488 track like so they can see it
porsche all day
Downvote: Prosche 🤣
I would have the 812, Turbo S second for racing, and SVJ last in the garage as a dust collector
Porsche😎
Please, no more yani moron
Ok can anyone accept the fact that the porshe is the fastest car but the cheapest and alsonmy favourite.. with a muffler mod
Porsche it's the best
porsche !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bro that Porsche is absolutely insane 👀
Come on Mat, you can jump start faster than this
It's a complicated desicion between Lambo and Porsche! But i think finally i would choose the Porsche!!!
cant stop wanting, imagining what/how it feels handling that Porsche .... what a car...
Yes mister Mat why don’t you and Yanni swop cars with some races
It’s all no wonder the Ferrari is faster on the straight line Obviously the SVJ is faster from zero but if they had a longer strip the Ferrari could have a catch up.  The Porsche has a very advanced gearbox system and also the weight distribution helps a lot it’s a 2020 car  Lambo looks like that from 10 years Almost and it’s a huge  The only thing is I think the Ferrari didn’t warmup properly for the first race and the lambo did which made a difference in the first race when the lambo took off
Porsche sounds the best, Matt... Stfu...
That Porsche really is incredibly fast.......... but I still think it's boring as fuck and I'd rather have either of the other two.   Though I love that lambo and the insane sound it makes
It would be just as entertaining if Matt and Yianni were racing minivans.
That’s it, lean forward like your tailgating a learner, you’ll go quicker
Ferrari
in stead of the Porsche u should of had the Mclaren 720s
Lambo all the way
Lambos need a dual clutch
Lambo all day everyday
Porsche is the best!
Yianni: If its a Lamborghini I'm in it.  Audi RS7 race: Um 🙄😂
I love the way that Lambo looks, and sounds.
Definitely would have the Porsche out of them 3
Race of the Year
the porche
Not my money: 812 Superfast. My money: 911 turbo.
Matt i guess the gt2 rs would be the better choice for comparison
You cant bring an SVJ and leave GT3RS out.... why dont u compare those with the ferarri
911 all the way all day!
Let's see a koenigsegg Matt
I rather have the Porsche but the Ferrari is the Prettiest
The 911, eazy!!
I love how Yianni could come 99th out of 100 cars but as long as he beats matt he's happy.
If i had money to buy It i would choose Ferrari 😜
Why does it look like the cars are racing at around 40mph
That's some serious sorcery under the Porsche s hood.
Ferrari 🔥
Porsche.  Talk softly, but carry a big stick.
Fiat 500
That moment when a Porsche is actually the bargain car 😅
Ferrari ❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wtf I didn’t know the Porsche was faster that’s crazy
I lost interest in all petrol cars after i saw how Tesla smokes them.
"It'll go viral if I die" 😂
The finish in the second race Sounds like yianni sreams
The TurboS is litttttt🔥🔥🔥 just destroys the competition every time!!!!!!
Speak softly and carry a big stick.
I would have the Porsche 911 Turbo S but as a cabrio, because if I’m going for the Coupe I may as well get the GT3 since the headroom first the rear seats are pointless on the coupe unless I kidnapped 2 leprechauns. If I had to choose a supercar though over the ferrari and lambo with looks to turn heads as well then I would go with McLaren and have a 720S, ironically both ONE of my dreamcars along with the Porsche but also it’s my wife’s dreamcar.
Porsches quietly kills and leaves. Excellent.
The 911, no question
The new 911 turbo S is a real monster... The best car .
I am German 🇩🇪 ... i like our cars... 😂😬👍
Do an RC car race vs real cars
Lamborghini SVJ for the beautie and Ferrari superfast for speed
Matt jumped the second race
Lamborghini SVJ💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼✌🏻
Англійські дебіли-ПОРШЕ,а не "порш"!!!
These days, the Porsche is only there for the back angle camera shots
Lambo 👌🏻
Porsche killed the gay cars.
911 Turbo S for me Anytime!!!🔥
Would still choose the new Porsche 911 Turbo S.
Porsche🔥🔥🔥
German Engineering, awesome
Okay but the porsche, even it is win the drag and brake test, its still does not considered to exist..
I just subscribed Matt!
I’d have the Porsche , most practical , fast , etc . Then the Ferrari , reasonable sound but not ridiculously loud , and looks reasonable especially novitek version. Finally SVJ too over top but definitely serious looks and sound , but a little flashy .
Id take the 911 over any of these cars. Its the more usable supercar, and cheaper lol.
Porsche rulez.
I go for the Ferrari!
Best car svj
Porsche's new slogan: No Talk All Walk.
not trying to insult Yannimize but he reminds me of one character from cartoon Wacky Races, Muttley the dog that is :D
Porsche is like a kid who doesn't speak too much but when ever it's his turn to score his kicks others ass.
Fuck yes ! That’s German Engineering
Cheapest car wins. Who'd have thought it.
The sad thing is I had to turn the volume up on my phone to hear the sound test of the 911
Porsche, all go no need for sound. LOL  Love the Ferrari! Next Porsche.  I think the Porsche is more practical everyday....??
Lambo went before the lady said go.
Race at 5:20. 🤬
Damn that Porsche tho
top notch editing, and no boomer memes!
That Porsche is something else, it's definitely the best car there
Porsche
That Porsche is insane! But if money was no object I would take the SVJ, but in another color... ooooor, the F12 + the Porsche for a little bit more $...
Aventador SVJ roadster ❤️🔥
I think the SVJ looks way better than the two😏 but i'd choose the 812 superfast
911 all day every day !!!
PUT SOME AMERICAN CARS !
Ferrari 4 sure
I want to have a Turbo S.
The 911 turbo s for sure, cheaper and faster
Porsche, no question
Lamborghini is kid in front of Porsche.
You guys Need the ferrari FXX K evo!
The Porsche Turbo S is the gentlemens supercar. It doesn't the big drama of a yelling engine to prove that it it's the fastest. The Lamborghini is too mucho and fits perfectly to the look of its owner imo
I love Porsche
I don’t know why but I was so happy to see that Porsche win, it’s literally the opposite of those obnoxious italian cars
Man, i love the Turbo S, but this Sound is just sad and before someone starts blaming Porsche ---> it's not their Fault. Fuck OPF and WLTP
That Ferrari all day everyday! Just gorgeous!
Porsche any day
Yanny is more focused on winning matt than winning the race 😂😂
SVJ All day
This is one of the best drag races I ever seen in this channel! Go ferrari!!
I would take the Porsche 10000%
Porsche is king. Who don't showoffs. And like an sword which cuts everything.
No chance that 812 sounds way better than the SVJ
Yianni likes lambos u can’t argue  But I this the Porsche looks just a bit better
Compared to Ferrari and Lambo, he should have used the gt2 RS.  But even so, they took it in the ass
Would rather have a lambo than a Ferrari
Bro that Porsche is a weapon wtf😹😹
The svj was the best sounding of the three
Porsche without a doubt!
The Ferrari sounds the best. By far
Porsche 911 Turbo S i love it
Porsche 911 turbo indeed  👍🏻 performance wise,  But for the looks, definitely the Lamborghini would definitely win
Mat and Yanni should host their own tv show 😂
Porsche love!
Can we talk about the Porsche 😂🤣😂
SVJ
The Porsche of course and have a lot of money left for more fun
Bruh they're just ignoring the Porsche, they know it'll win everything
Lambo jumped the start by a mile
So mostly a race for 2nd place lol
I'd rather have the aventador svj and sell it and buy a Porsche 911 turbo s.
911
As a Porsche lover, i would like to have the Porsche but the Ferrari UGH beautifull ...
All shows no goes, Porsche half price half size , big firework in small pack did it!! When it beat Tesla I knew what Porsche was all about
Always Porsche !!!!!!!!
That was amazing!!! Hopefully in the future we can see the exact same race but with the new McLaren 765LT!!!???
Ferrari sound the best for me  If i’m rich i will buy them all with a dbs superlegera
I’m Italian, perfect accent 😂👌
🇩🇪 the best
Porsche for ever
Porsche all the way ...... :)
Porshe porshe porsheeeee süperrrr 🤟
that German impression at the beginning was priceless! hahaha
I would choose the Porsche but, at 6’8...I might not be very confortable in it 😂😂😂 So I prefer the Ferrari!!! 💪
This dude leaning in with the shifts lmao
I’d take the 812 over those 2 any day. With the right exhaust and tune you’re driving an 850+hp NA V12 Ferrari.
I don't care abou the porche...I'm very happy that the Lambo won...
Why does yianni look like an Indian Cab driver while he is in a drag race?😂 Any Indians? Y'all might know😂😂
Mate the Porsche any day.  The superiority of that Porsche is on another level. Its faster than the lambo and the Ferrari while having a smaller engine, a flat 6!!. That's German engineering for you.
You cant beat turbo power 650 beats 770 and 800 peak bhp ain't all that
Why r the cars so faaar apart?  social distancing?
Ferrari Superfast of course, fastest and most beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
It's a shame the Ferrari's stooped so low :/
the fucking porsche is fucking fast
I ❤️ Lambo since childhood, but seems Yanni always makes me want to find another girl
SVJ ALL DAY
porsche
Lambo SVJ
992 ttS - the one car that does it all (reliable, low depreciation, low maintenance costs and it even has two rear seats!).
When Bugatti Veyron vs Porsche 911 Turbo S?
Of coure I choose Porsche 911 Turbo S <3
I think I'd like to have the Ferrari the most, but that Porsche is an absolute road and track crushing weapon. (Of course, I'd be happy to drive that too). When it comes to Lamborghinis, I prefer the Huracan over the Aventador. A good friend of mine got to spend a whole day driving a Superfast recently and said that was a dual personality machine, over the top when you wanted it to be, and a pussycat when you just wanted to cruise around town. I am sure the Porsche is similarly flexible, if not more so.
You just asked a question which car would I have. Head says "Ferrari"(last naturally aspirated) ... Heart says 'SVJ'(looks the best)...and nut sack says 'The Beast'(what does one say)
Would definitely have the porsche
For all the Porsche Fanboys losing their minds, This is what it was built for. The Lamborghini and Ferrari would catch it up in the top end because, the were built for higher speed. The 911 was made for a different purpose, thus why it has an insane acceleration.
Porsche never disappoints. And money no object [Which it is], the Porsche is the better buy for pure driving. The Lambo if you want to pose and the Ferrari if you want to flaunt your bank balance.
Let's see which expensive exotic is the fastest, Porsche: hold my beer, that Porsche OMG
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ wow
Porsche has over 100hp less well on paper lol hehe
Ferrari is the best
Porsche would be a good choose if you would be lookin for a safe and cheaper car in my opinion
Svj
“Let’s talk about the bull beating the horse” little does he know the Porsche is a horse as well
Soft limiters on Porsche 😂
I liked before even watching
5:05 lmao 😂😂😂
Matt i think you jumped the line on the second time round...🤔
Lamborghini over Ferrari
ferrari losing everywhere... f1, carwow...
bro this is the one ive been waiting for
Ferrari 812 easy for me!!
The porsche is that anime kid that is the loser at the beginning and the most op bich at the end.
the Aventador is cool but just a little too over the top for me. the 812 is amazing but i think the Porsche just speaks to me. silent killer
Hands down Ferrari lol idc if it loses a drag race, it’s been my dream car.
I would have the Porsche, sorry Yanni
Porsche all day followed by the 812 and then the Lamborghini.
812 anyday
Even the Porsche Taycan would beat them let’s be honest Porsche gives you more value for less money
Turbo S is the BEAST and my choice!
Pordche is the best ♥️💪🏽
Porsche, Porsche, Porsche. Oh and also Porsche. Love the other two, but to me there's nothing better than a low key beauty that will outperform the loud and flashy cars. Also engineering over flash.
Lambo SVJ definitely
When is the new corvette going to be featured ???? 😱
If I buy a car to go fast, of course I'd chose the Porsche. But Lambo looks nicer tbh. I'm just saying that Porsche is FAST.
I don't know why Lamborghini is slow...😑😑
I would like to have the ferrari
For me 911 turbo s 3.8 really Quick
Jannie, always jumps the start
Need to see some more koenigsegg on this channel Matt !!!
Can't wait till the new McLaren 765lt take on this new 911 then we will see who's really the king....
Lamborghini SVJ she   Sounds Like a dream
"Let's talk about the bull beating the horse"  Porsche:👀😶
I get a smile on my face every time a Ferrari losses to a lambo. Glad the underdog won. And that porche though 😍
The only heartbreaking thing about that 911 is its engine note. Literally everything else about it is amazing
As an older guy and a Porsche owner....no contest. Obviously the Porsche. Apart from it being the best car, In look reasonable driving the Porsche through town Driving one of the others I'd look like an asshole.
And that's why you buy a Porsche.....
I’d take the Porsche., Way cheaper and I love the classic shape. Cheers 🍻
two glorious sounding cars get beaten by a boosted beatle ;-)
Porsche is faster, better brakes... But boring and revs limited. The appearance of the SVJ is awesome. F1 sound of the Ferrari. Final veredict: Lamborghini (Volkswagen) hahaha Nice video guys. Congrats.
The Porsche wins now..!  imagine with a few more pounds of boost.. 💨 c ya...
Ummmm Matt. You can't tell your pressure by looking at the tires. Those sensors are way better than your eyes trust me and trust the equipment. Next time just bring a portable tire pressure checker thingy. They're very very cheap and can fit in your pocket
Ferrari
Ok 1st without watching or reading any comments Il say Porsche slays it. Il come back to confirm it after I watch the video!
Porsche me surpreendeu top de mais
Porsche 911 is lub <3
This is one of my favorite drag races to date
just buy a Turbo S and put install a new exhaust
Liking it before I even watch it.
I like Porsche
Why don't you guys use the overboost on the 911? It gives max boost for 20s for max power. Would be nice to see if it makes a difference.
Oh God! I did not expect that intro. 😂😂😂😂 Perfect!
The porsche is the cheapest, the one with the fewest hp but it's the fastest because its German car technology
Ferrari
I would take the Porsche first and then, very close, l would take the Ferrari!
Tells me sound doesn't matter
Jesus, that Lambo sounds like thunder tearing through the sky.
The intro 🤪🤣
Imagine if Porsche made a super car for the Lamborghini, mcclaren, and Ferrari.... this is just a 911
this 911 is absolute BONKERS!!!
Single clutch on the lambo makes all the difference if it had dual clutch like the other two it would have won every race
Porsche didn't even break a sweat. And even tho the Lambo looks sick, I'd still choose the 911 all day. Love it!
Porsche is that quiet kid at the back of the class who brings it on track day 💔😂😂  Can we have the Huracan Performante against the 812
You need to race a hurrican preformote vs the 812
812 superfast
Lamborghini aventador svj
Porsche sounded good and Lamborghini SVJ is gonna win 😂
Damn, but seriously, in the rolling race, the exhaust note of the V12 under full acceleration 😍😍😍😍 At 9:40 !!!
Porsche #1
the intro is soooooo long and boring... 🤬
I never saw  anybody  celebrating 2nd place so much...ha ha
812 😍
6 German Cylinders against 12 Italian Cylinders 😂🤣
Best looking Lamborghini, best sound Lamborghini, fastest is the bug
Porsche-"Win in silence"
Porche 911 definitely sounded better :)
I'm gonna take that cheap Porsche 😊😊
Definitely the Porsche
Porsche just keep perfecting their already perfect formula.
I’d have the Porsche no doubt
i would take the porshe
Make a video with a Supra, a GTR and a Porsche 911 Turbo S
The Porsche has almost 100hp less than the Aventador... wtf
for looks its the svj but mannnn that porsche has some real great engineers
Porsche is the absolute best and the only everyday car, Porsche is just expected to win all the time amazing Porsche love them
The Porsche in yellow!
I’d have the Porsche Matt as it doesn’t stand out as much as the other 2 & it’s a super car killer!
Porsche 911 Turbo S ! Das Auto ! Stuttgart knows how to do things ! ✌🏼🍀💪🏼
Porsche
For fck sake!!! That Porsche is killing those „supercars“!!! The Germans do on German cars better than on the Italians 😂😂 I love this car so much
My guys at cs panda really witg 20 subscribers.....
Porsche 911 turbo s
so the cheapest and the most economist car wins.......... ok
Porsche all way up for me😍
Porche
BEST CAR WOW VIDEO EVER 😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'd go with ferrari, best looking for sure
The sound, the look, the power of the Lamborghini wins my heart❤️❤️❤️❤️
Porsche all day
Porsche and porsche
Not sure if it fits here.  A saying in Germany: Hunde, die bellen, beißen nicht. Dogs that bark, they don’t bite.   😁
Porsche 😲😲👌👌👌
Ferrari
Really enjoy races between May and Yianni, just so funny
Carwow should be renamed to “One more go”
I think Lamborghini won the brake test because porsche was little behind before braking.
Porsche
I'm not that rich so definitely the Porsche is the all around better car and new 911s are beautiful
Porsche for sure
The engineering in that Porsche is insane. Destroyed the lambo and Ferrari
Porsche
Thanks a lot Yanni  Man!! Today I was watching an old lambo  drag race of carwow  And I just talked in my mind , that a lambo SVJ  is missing , which should be thereeeeeeee in drag race , and obviously driven by Yanni you , " You Are Such A Great Lambo Driver And Fanboy " You should be hired by lamborghini for testing their  monsters . Thanks a lot Yanni and Mat Mat brother if you seeing this comment plz 🙏🙏 convey my message to Yanni " #DieHardFanOfLambo #AlwaysAppreciateYanniAndYoursVideo #LoveFromIndia #ThankYouYanni #ThanksMat #CarwowShouldBeAssignedTheOfficalSiteForDragRacingCars
Porsche Porsche Porsche!!!👍👍👍
What is even more crazy is that a remap would likely take that 911 up to the 800hp region too.
It wasnt German english in 2020, mr Watson noo way 😂its strange
PORSCHE. rules.  Thats all I need in my garage...
I'd have either the Porshe or the Ferrari
They're just finding ways to beat the Porsche.
but we will crush them😂😂
You need hypercar to beat the Porsche
Funniest intro ever🤣
The italians loooks AMAZING but seems that that german car beats bought of you without a doubt
Nissan GTR 60-130 in 2.55 so try with that car from usa :D
Porsche
Porsche
The Second run is really intense
Porsche
Can anything beat the porche
Matt your accents are more than solid :D
Porsche
Wow
The Porsche is incredible. Beating cars that cost much more, in the Lambo's case more than double, and making it look easy. The Lambo and the Ferrari are great looking and sounding cars, but the Porsche delivers when it counts.
Porsche
Carwow needs to learn to shut up and start the race already for gods sake
Porsche
Porsche
That Porsche is stupid fast
Porsche 911 Turbo S THE GOAT
Porsche
Porsche
Porsche! But u need to find some hypercars to beat it.
Lambo
Porsche
Porsche why wouldnt u want the fastest and cheapest ?
Matt!!! I see you’ve been working on your accent😌😌😌!! Quarantine has been a useful time I see 😌
100% Porsche
Is the lambo stock? The sound coming off of it from the first drag race is simply eargasmic
Ferrari basically is faster on a longer straight...
Porsche all day long, no arguments.
Superfast1, svj2, turbo s 3 . But that Porsche is fast as hell though
I would rather have the porsche
I disagree. The accents were pretty good
Porsche or aventador
Im telling this again,...yianni makes these vids so much more fun. Lol
Lets get a car that can beat the porche😫😫😫😫
Porsche is the best without a doubt, it's the unassuming one with a 100 notches on its bed post.
That Porsche has more than 650 hp for sure...
Porsche 911
Please show the driver of porche
Porsche is best, I would take the Ferrari.
Porsche is like a real life superhero
Definitely Porsche Turbo S is my dream car!!! 😍🙏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Remember Ferrari is always Ferrari
Porsche
If the Ferrari was red then maybe I'd pick it and I like the lambo but it's got to be the Porsche, goes good stops good and looks good
Hard to imagine that SVJ with a proper gearbox.
That 911 Turbo s might be the best car ever made man.
Use a racing starter. Drivers are jump starting all the time.
Porsche is jus too good yannie should consider the upgrade to a 918 spyder mayb😂
10:27 min Matt open Ferrari door with his shoe 🤣👌👍
Porsche best sound ever
the 911 is almost like a sleeper
The 911 was like yea y’all could could make all the noise you want just bring that same energy to the finish line 🏁 😂😂😂
Porsche everyday....! Obliterated the Italians...!
I love yianni
Putting your life at risk?! Top Gear: Hold my beer
Ferrari looks the best Lamborghini sounds the best Porsche is the best all rounder
Best looking: Ferrari Porsch Lambo
BAVARIAN BEATDOWN
SVJ
Someone bring a 765lt to beat the Porsche
Ferrari: Ciao, Lamborghini.... 😆  The Porsche : hold my autobahn 😜 🚗🚓
812 sf!!!
Lambo lost only because of that ancient gearbox it has
Lamborghini
Porsche vs bugatti veyron!
Ferrari is best in sound. And I wish to have a Ferrari
What is wrong with this Porsche😂
992 TURBO S!!!!!
Definitely Ferrari
Porsche always underrated their power numbers. 650hp is in reality 700+
svj
Porsche wins with six cylinders tied behind its back.
5:23
svj
🇮🇹
Porsche rules, other 2 are for suckers to buy.
SVJ, so I can sell it and buy a 911& a 812 😂
i think the porche driver messed up the shift on second roll race
Ferrari sounds the best 🔥🔥
Must be embarrassing having either that ferrari or lambo and just  knowing you payed twice the price for a worse  car 🤣🤣😉
Crazy Porsche...
https://youtu.be/mG7GBGcABYQ 1:09 porschE
Netflix needs to hire you!
I would pick the Ferrari superfast
The fact the turbo s kills lambos top end.. 992 gt2rs will be interesting to say the least
Porsche 911 is the best and beautiful looking car
its not LAMBO vs  FERRARI vs  Porsche 911 ............Its MATT VS YANNI ...
I would have the svj. I would sell it and buy 2 911s.
I love the SVJ, but i'd have the Porsche - more sensible.
Porsche 911 992.1 turbo S
lamborgini
Porsche i would get the Porsche for real for real its just so sexy
😂😂🤣 What a f**king Joke!...A 770 hp bull and a nearly 800 hp stallion being humbled badly by the PTs! proving once again that hp alone does not win races, even for exotic supercars🧐😏
Action starts @ 5:20
Aventador SVJ
This was secretly a Porsche ad.
Porsche 👌
Another great video please do more crazy drag race with the Porsche 911 turboS I would like to know which car can win it. Also just to piss out Yanni I’ll vote for the 911... 🤣
Porsche with a straight pipe
id say porsche as i think they are the top of the supercar world and they look the best
Yanni jumped the start on the rolling race still lost 😂
You guys need to get the 765 LT when it comes out.
Porsche is juss better
The porsche kills everyone on track, you know it Mat
we not gunna talk about yianni jumping the start on the first go????
Porsche 911 turbo is an excellent car. Its performance is so good This is my dream car. ❤️
Porsche
I don't owe anyone anymore thanks to, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
Sen and ferrie and porche OK carwow
Porsche
Porsche
Porsche
Yanni jumped the first race, and still lost LOL
I wasn't expecting a banger of a video getting on YouTube today but here we are, with a banger of a video.
id take the lambo anyday
Porsche
So we just going to ignore that the Porsche smashed the more expensive cars with all talk😂!
Porsche
Porsche
Porsche
Porsch with the best Sound 👌
Why every time you put a Lambo on, it actually gets uglier?!?!?! LOL!!
How funny the beginning. 🤣🤣🤣. Awesome drag race. I would have all of them. Ferrari because it's. Ferrari. Adventador for sound and design. Porsche to go to the office a bit fast.  Yanny looser. Look at his face 🤣🤣🤣.
Actually I thought the Porsche would get defeated today, because look at those L and F figures. What a monster is the Turbo S with this tiny engine. But it needs some aftermarket exhaust.
Money no object? ALL OF THEM!
For me sounds better the 812
The ferrari 812 superfast
So it was all about who comes second and third And about engine noise let success make the noise.
I'd happily take that 812 and drive it until I am buried in it. Amazing vehicle and I am far from a Ferrari guy
If l have money, I will buy Porsche 911.
1- 812 2- porsche 3- svj
Porsche all day, everyday
Ferrari sounded best
Lol so basically buy a porsche and with the 100k+ saved go take the family on a high end vacation and get your wife a porsche too lol
GMC
As yanni would say about the Lamborghinis. Porsche. All day, everyday
I think lambo must start make some turbo cars... this is shame.
Lambos  driver is a fool  Racing in the slowest mode by Lamborghini 😡😡
Money no object......PORSCHE all day for me. 1994 911 turbo s
Porsche
911 for sure its just sexy and classic the lambo and ferarri arent that fast they are just made to be loud and scare Karon
I would go for the Porsche all the way
Ferrari over lambo
id have that Porsche everyday over those others... It is just killing it for the half of the price! And no... im no fan of 3 brands, but got to admit that Porsche is Savage!
Expected porche to be last against the 2 v12 makes no sense 😦
That Porsche is ALL BUSINESS!!!
Lamborghini ✌🏼
Waking up to this in america like mm coffee and Car Wow supercars... not muffins....supercars  Id have the porsche it would last 10x longer without maintenance after break in.
Lamborghini svj what's the best car
Definitely the all new Porsche it's amazing
ferrari 🤩
Sound and looks- Lambo the best
What exactly happened? got spanked by that Porsche, that's what happened
The Turbo S is unreal. Phenomenal machine.   Money no object I still would get the F12 Ferrari 😂
spoiler alert:    in these drag races the german always wins
Yanni cheats everytime
That Porsche
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Porsche...what a car
Mat CLEARLY jumped the second race
Porsche all the way and i feel you should have repeated the rolling race in 3rd gear as i think the Porsche driver lagged and not the car itself 😜
Porsche of course...the Lambo looks like it's driven through Halfords and all the tacky tat has stuck to it :-)
Ferrari sounds much better than lambo
Epic
Of course the Porsche
Porsche
Matt do street cars modified cars
man honestly i dont think anyone is more passionate than yanni. love his true emotions.
Aston martin DBS superleggera                         VS BMW M8 Competition 2020 😄 plis MR @Carwow
Can any stock car beat the Turbo S on a drag? Seems to be the king and probably returns 30mpg!
1) 812 2) Turbo S 3) SVJ
SVJ Aventador
Amazing, a drag race between 3 cars that i all son't give an shite about
porsche any day all day.
Glad I own a Porsche and something reliable than that Italian junk.
You guys should have added 720s as well
Porsche 911 turboS
Porche was brilliant
812 for me 💕💕💕💕
PORSCHE!!!!!
Gt2 rs
Always nice to see Yianni😂
Hahahaahahhah
The Ferrari is the nicest looking out of all of those cars, the Lambos all look too similar...bit like the grey Beetle in the video.
literally the BEST Porsche commercial I've ever seen. Not the best looking in comparison...no... but it's just.... better.
That Porsche though
"but we will crush them" almost spat out my coffee hahaha
Yani always has a weight disadvantage. When you give the weight info of the car, you have to add 240 pounds extra of Yani.
Porch
Porsche 911 👍
Porsche is Porsche. Best car on earth
PORSCHE!  but I need the top off!
Svj
L o u d e s t drag race e v e r
I would take Ferrari..
The 812 Superfast definitely sounds the best! Ferrari’s exhaust sounds are 👑
Damn what they get out of a flat 6 with 650HP is astonishing. Just imagine they went fully retard and made a V12 800+ HP Porsche 🤔
Man the Turbo S is fast.
I'd have the Porsche
Gimme the 812
Ferrari all day
That porche is dangerous
Svj
I'm happy matt for finally u holed to radio with left hand when racing rolling 👌😄
The cheapest is the fastest
Ferrari all day long
My opinion best sound 812 Best looking 812 Best for the price 911 Am not a big lambo fan
Love yani
Ferrari is clearly the fastest, but the RWD just kills it at low speeds.
u know what ... I will get the german engineering piece of art
Porsche 911 Turbo S for sure
porche . the ultimate dream car . only proper car enthusiasts will respect the porches subtleness and ability . what a machine .
That porsche is a like a hunter
Ferrari was a disappointment. So much power and torque that did not deliver. He must have been comfort mode.
Porsche all day
SVJ all the way!
Daily drive the porsche, Lamborghini as the weekend warrior
Lambo all day any day
I vote for Ferrari 812 superfast and I loved the sound of it
Porche is the best
The fastest  drag time in carwow  is from a bike lmao
Sorry boy lambo sounds better
Matt do a Camry vs accord vs maxima
Yanni said we all know what the PORSCHE is about.    SO LAMBORGHINI ISNT ABOUT SHIT? LMAO!
They shouldve brought in the mclaren 720s
The Ferrari is better
Sorry Yanni. At this point the Aventador is just a dead horse they're beating. The first gen was the best. Now it's just looking increasingly infantile. It's either Ferrari or Porsche.
911 TURBO S FTW
The 911 lol
porche
Wow Turbo S with only a 6 cylinder and a 3rd of the price, I wish they would make a 4 L V8 TwinTurbo in the 911, It would be something else
Porche of course, are u crazy???
That Lamborghini farts hard lmao .
i would actually pick porsche..............for sure
I WAS RIGHT 3.8 PORSCHE 911 WON! HAS 6 LESS CALLENDERS! AMAZING!  WHO ELSE KNEW THE PORSCHE WOULD WIN!
Lambo jumped the start big time
Ferrari ferrari and always ferrrari
PORSCHE 911
Mat: “Enough with the silly accents”... proceeds to continue talking in a silly accent
Ferrari 812 super fast
yianni do be hitting that Lamborghini v12 rev limiter like its a fucking 2jz
Ferrari 812 Superfast 😍
Porsche is just insane..
992 Porsche Turbo S
Βrand new 991 Turbo S...Wow! What a supercar! Or (in other words) how Germans with 650Ηp only can win the 750/800Hp. The torque (and the weight) rulezzzzzzz!
I'd take the 812
Silent but deadly = Porsche, would be a great add
Porsche for me
As much as I would love the porsche but it's just not that good looking car man.
That lambo on the limiter 😭😭
The Ferrari 812
Ferrari all day every day
Why the Lambo Race in Strada Mode and Not in Corsa ?!
911 Turbo s
The Ferrari 💙
Ferrari sounds better.... if not a tie between Lamborghini ...
The least powerful car won't. German engineering at its finest.
The porsches revs we're actually so high pitched that only dogs or people with superhuman hearing can hear it
the Porsche is my go-to
I think I watched more ads than the actual race video. Thumbs down.
I wish you could still downvote someone on Youtube... :(
Why isn't the supra not racing in any of your videos?
The porshe all the way. Never liked ferrari or lambogini may be if you had a cadillac cts V then may be i would go for that one.
if Ferrari is super fast... then Porsche what is!!?? 🤭
Yianni in a Lambo is why this channel has 4 million+ subs!
Porchee as if it didn't exist in the 🤣😂wooooow race and much cheaper
Porsche
Fake
lambo
SvJ looks better
aventador SVJ then 812 superfast then 911 turbo s
812 all day everyday, but can we have a 765lt in this haha
We know the SVJ will beat the others on the Nurburgring!
Thats crazy how the Porsche is down on Power and alot cheaper, but its actually the better car
Hahah it's always Ferrari vs. Lamborghini...and Porsche in the back beating both. But no one wants to acknowledge it lol
Porsche 💪🏼👍🏼
And the porsche didn't warm up his tyres hahaha yet it still win.
Porsche hands down
I don't understand why, having cars with so much power, they don't do two drag races, one with 400 meters (1/4 mile) and the other with 800 meters (1/2 mile)
Lambo: car Ferrari: car Porsche: witchcraft
Only Porsche
The Porsche’s Bite is way bigger than its bark, and I kind of like it
Porsche: half the price twice the engineering
I had a cracking race ‘on private roads’ with an SVJ770 LP4 vs my bike. Although not as fast it was the quickest car I’ve ever been against
That porche is so sick
Can someone please tell Yanni to stop jumping the start. He always goes early and it’s not a fair race.
I would have the 812 but that porcshe is the best car for the money by a mile
Lamborghini is the best and the beast #lamborghini
I would have the Porsche.
Porsche 911 Turbo S (992), why? I'll tell you why: Cheapest of the three, and still being the quickest one (depends on the driver or the condition of the vehicle or the weather), that is why.
Definitely the Porsche
It'd be a tough choice between the Ferrari and Lambo for me. I REALLY  like ANY Aventador but a Ferrari is just the more desirable brand to me.
Watch out for the horse on your right Yianni
Money is on the 3.8 twin turbo Porsche!
That lambo trying to be somethings that it's just not 🤔🥴
Lambo without a question.. best looking and sounding by a mile!!💪💪
No one gonna mention how good his accents are haha
Which car would I take, Gee let me think...
But the whole moral story of this race is that, Porsche 911 Turbo ate those two. Twice. Yep, TWICE.
Aventador svj
The Porsche sounds the best
Thats not fair, the guy in the lambo is fat
Porsche because lambo is just an overpriced Audi 🤷🏻
Lambo is the wild one night stand you later cringe about.    Ferrari is the girl you date that is so hot you overlook her serious issues for a little while just to be with her.    That Porsche is the one you marry and live happily ever after.
Give the mystery driver some screen time
911
Imagine if the Porsche had the hp of the Ferrari, aerodynamics and weight of the Lambo. It would be the fastest car ever
Was Yanny straining to have a sh*t during that race?
Every time I’m watching this videos I feel like I’m watching a movie!
i like FERRARI looks and PORSCHE performance
Yianni with Lambo: I’M GONNA WIN!!   Porsche: Aight imma end this man’s whole career with the power of SILENCE
That Porsche is one hell of a car sheesh
The Porsche would have won even more if the track is longer
Porsche turbo s for suer
Lambo jumped the line the first time but I still think the Rarri is a sleeper.
German Cars Are the best ❤️
I'm not a fan of the prancing horse, fucking hate their f1 team but that car does look best imo. I love that kind of shape. Then I'd go for the porsche, always a classic. The lambo used to be my favourite when I was a kid, now I see it as over the top and for bling bling guys desperate to shag 18 year olds....so given the choice, I'd pick the bull
Porsche off course
porshe
PORSCHE HANDS DOWN
Matt that's racist 0-0:19
that middle eastern dude always cheat at start
Porsche in the best
Hahahaa.. the Porsche 911 won the drag race.. why even talk about the Lambo and Ferrari? 😂 German Power 💪🏼  And of course I would have the 911 Turbo S. 👍🏼😊
How the hell does he afford to have like 7 lambos
The new Porsche 911 turboS is Singing "SEE YOU  SEPTEMBER" song all day. Cheers from Canada.
812
Turbo S is 80hp down from the SVJ *laguhs*
It’s like the Porsche wasn’t even here 😂😂😂😂😂  Porsche’s just here to silently destroy other vehicles.  The face Yianni makes when Matt’s about to beat him in a drag race 😂😂😂😂😂😂
The Porsche straight said yep bye
That porsche is crazy fast!
I usually am a Lamborghini guy but I don't know the 812 is just such a beautiful car, I think I'd get this one.
..and ‘pretty’ as well ....
Svj
SVJ did much better than I expected. Launch was amazing.
Porsches are legends ...
7:21 - 7:31😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Yianni only cares about one and one thing only,  Beating Mat.
I would always take the 812 But its fact that the Porsch is the best ☝️
The 911 Turbo S still shocks me how fast it is with only 650hp, incredible car
when he asked the girl why she was wearing headphones I legit thought the video was sponsored
if the porsche looked nicer than would be amazing
Why can’t Matt say the word ‘excited’ correctly ✌️ excited has a ‘t’ in it
these flamboyant need for speed lambos are not very good at all, that porsche is a right piece of kit
@carwow should start weighing the cars instead of quoting theoretical figures. No way the SVJ sat there is 1525kg or it would disappear on the horizon.
Definitely, the Porsche as it's faster, cheaper and more practical, but I do agree with Yanni that the SVJ is the best looking car out of the 3 and the best sounding.
downt speek anglish like sis agan plees
lambo
The 812 look way better than the SVJ
Whoa, Porsche 🙌🏾. New found respect
Porsche... ANYTIME.
I can here to see the fat fragile ego :-D
I mean obviously the porsche sounded the best come on guys don't be silly
Ferrari
SVJ
Porsche all day
Ferrari 812: Im gonna win Lambo SVJ: NO chance i got this   Porsche 911: Hold my race
I would take the SVJ
LAMBO SV J
It's like every video has to have dislikes
People who say Porsches are overpriced this is for you. Half the price of other cars still beat them
6:51 starter face reveal  :O
Still, a Ferrari is always a Ferrari! Always turning heads, no matter the gender! Been proved for decades!!
I really do love the turbo s, sooo yea
Porsche
Ferrari 812
Porsche stworzył auto idealne
911 every day!!
Should have brought La Ferrari against SUPER VELOCE JOTA.
Lambo
German engineering.. Still superior...
Next time use the 488 pista vs svj
The Porsche is a stealthy machine with percision and it would be easy to live with
Imagine if the Porsche just had more hp!!
Porsche all day
Matt looked like Michael Schumacher in first glance I was like he is back and nobody even knows that
i want to see a race where the 720s is in the race as well 🥺
All of my favourite cars except the gt 2 rs instead of the 911 turbo s
Best intro ever.
Which of the three would I have? Porsche. Hands down, easiest choice of my life.
911 turbo s vs 488 pista plssssss
That 911 is stupid quick for the money
Ferrari all day everyday!
Ferrari of course !
I’ll have the Porsche! Thanks
Next drag race should be: Mclaren 765LT vs Porsche 911 Turbo S/GT2 RS
I'd take the ferrari, money no object
Everyone was making fun of Porsche sound, and they got smoked 😂😂😂
Porsche is just like Mclaren rely on turbo engine to be fast, it doesn’t have a sound and doesn’t provoke any emotions for true sports car enthusiasts. Italian naturally aspirated engines are unmatchable. I am a big Ferrari fan but the SVJ is a hell of a car
Lambo svj of course
Best CARWOW drag race ever?
Yianni did jump the line at first drag race
911 turbo S hands down.
Yanni jumped the start both times
Not gonna lie, these days I'm more interested on who is gonna win between Mat and Yianni more than the actual races 😂😂
It's the ferrari any day for me. 100k cheaper than the lambo and sounds superb 😍
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I laughed my ass off at 7:16 (uh oh). And damn this dragrace sounds good!
That porsche is ridiculous
The Ferrari sounds the best but by 4:47 I've come to peace with the fact that it's(911Turbo) going to win again.... Prediction in...
I would go with the super fast
Bull kicked the a** of the 'Prancing Horse'. LOL.
Beyond the shadow of  a doubt,unquestionably, indisputably the 911 Turbo S; equally fast if not faster from a dig , certainly a better daily driver , and  I could use the additional 200k (Lambo)/ 100k (Ferrari ).
992 911 turbo for me please.
Funny how they did not warm the tyres on the 720 when the 720 vs 911.
Porsche is that quite kid that you don’t want to underestimate
At this point carwow needs some hypercars to go up against that porsche 😂😂
Yianni 😂😂👍🏻
Also Matt Watson looks like a cheat meat sales man 😃
SVJ❤
Porsche 911 Turbo S
911 TTS is a beast but the exhaust sound is horrible coming from a $200K supercar
Porsche 911 turbo s ... My uncle has it ; it's breath taking
Porsche ANY DAY!
imagine matt driving lamborghini aventador
911 of courseeee 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
Porsche... All day..
SVJ any day of the week
One of the most confusing drag races lol
Put them on the racetrack please. Porsche 911 all the way.
Porsche is engineering perfection 👌🏽
812
Lambo all day loooongggg
A silent pay back from Porsche
Out of the three I would still chose the Porsche mainly because it can be daily driven no matter the weather.
That Porsche is not fucking 650 my ass shit was moving very impressive
Yianni is SUCH AN ARSEHOLE.   How does a grown man behave like this and not get roundly abused from everyone he comes across.  He's like a caricature of himself. WHAT A TOOL.
I can’t believe out of a Ferrari and Porsche, the Lamborghini is the lightest...
That Porsche is like Lewis Hamilton, everyone’s battling for second best 👀
Just see the fan base of a 911 turbo🤩😎🔥🔥🔥🔥. Don't mess with a Porsche.
I love this everyday drag race
That porsche is a really sleeper
That porsche is crazy 🤪
You should try to get a jdm legend to race
Ferrari looks GORGEOUS. But it is surprising that the Porsche smoked them.
I buy porsche
Unfortunately, I think I’m turning into a Porsche fanboy.
Ferrari looks way better blacked out
Lamborghini svj of course what do you think the best beautiful and fast car
Every honda driver 5:25
This proves that in case you ever need to decide between Ferrari and Lamborghini, choose Porsche. Imagine what the Turbo S would achieve, if it had the same HP numbers as the other two cars.
As italian, i’m astonished how your accent was !! Haahha
Ferrari is the best looker , Lambo, white with a sticker kit to tart it up. Porsche, beautifully understated, all confident and ready, and they haven't turned a corner yet.
I guess turbos do reign supreme. Italians will never exceed the Germans. These cars are for the Uber rich.
Should have add NSX to compete
Ferrari Is The Best ❤️❤️
The Porsche was puttin' the spankin' to them.  Less HP and less $$$.
Ferrari.
812 super fast, it reminds me of a C7 corvette that grew up, & with a na 789hp V12, I’ve seen 2 in the last 2 days, a yellow & a blue. It’s a sick whip.
5:20 and 7:01
Interested to see how the 765 does now Porsche went off on this year’s Turbo S
Lamborghini has better launch control than ferrari because of 4wd  But still ferrari is best v12 on earth currently u can buy
Ad have the 812
Porsche >
Why is the 911 sooooo fast?????
aventador:)
Porsche looks the best
Porsche is best
Porsche let's put all the money into the performance than Design.
Porsche would make a mincemeat out of those two if it was the same horsepower!!!
that lambo just sounds good and that's it.....carbon fiber rear midmounted V12 with 4wd and it barely beat the ferrari which is a front engined  GT...all show no go
That V12 in the Ferrari loves to rev
Ferrari 812 defo the best looking
911 Turbo S all day
I want that lambo
911
My dream car ❤️ love the Porsche
Porsche... i would get the porsche anytime
Ferrari fan boys like here
No start no win!
The Lambo and Ferrari hats did not make them faster ;).   Yahni "what Porsche??"  :)
11:34 looked like James Charles in the Porsche
Porsche baby!!
Porsche
Porsche
Dont need to have a drag race to find out who is fastest when you are driving a porsche.
Porsche 100%
That Porsche is a beast! Even with less power managed to crush the Ferrari and the Lamborghini... wooow
I love ferrari sound
The Porsche, obviously it’s the best car sorry Luigi and Mario 😂
Sighhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, he jumped the start again. Getting boring those dragraces with that guy.
That Porsche is a silent killer
Prosche 911 best
I'll take the SVJ, all I care about is that it beat the 812 in the drag race. Its the best looking car and the transmission is the only weak part and why it lost the rolling race.
Its the porsche definitely
porsche is best of  i want to see it in a drag race with Dodge d Demon pls like to see Mat
Imagine the 918 vs the SVJ and 812
Half the price, half the cylinders, less power = Wins. Gotta love Porsche. What a wicked car. What a legend!
This is ur best drag race. And it is not predictable 👏💯💥😱😆
Why is that porsche so fast!!! Bargain by comparison.
Could you get a hold of a Hennessey Trackhawk HPE1200? retail is $179,000.. it has ran a 9.6 in the 1/4 mile, would be cool to see it compared to the 911 Turbo S for being such a big vehicle.
id the the Porsche anyday. got a 86 944 with 30k miles all original in my garage. has never seen the rain.  I hate lambos but i do love a good Ferrari
already knew that porsche is gonna win
Prochain épisode de McLaren P1
Salut da Luxemburgo Europe
Did anyone notice that mat jumped the start?? Didn't he?
Thats why the 911 is my fav car.That car is something magical...
Omg 😍 best start
Posers beware cause the silver bullet is coming to hunt you down😂
That 911 turbo s is a beast talk about bang for your buck
yanni is funni
The first race the Lambo jumpstart!
Ferrari
This video felt like Ferrari vs Lamborghini  Porsche is not even considered in this video
Porsche any day
Porsche is a good example of the term "Small but mighty". To me it is the best looking car out of the three
Lambo
The ferrari
911 turbo S💪🏻
Looks: the FERRARI Sound: the LAMBO SPEED: the little grey thing in the distance
Porsche all day everyday💪
Don't worry, Ferrari has experience with getting crushed. Greetings from Formular 1
812
I VOTE FOR Ferrari
Porsche 100%. That 911 turbo s is insane. Faster than any tesla on its stupid fast mode too😂😂😂😂
I would get the Ferrari, it’s cool, carbon fiber engine and wheel, it’s lit bro. If I can’t get that then I will get the Porsche, but lambo not really my thing.
Alride to Wat Matson! A great one for a great man. I say to you I bless but the result is clear the Porsche is a real car for real people  resultwise the other cars are flamboyant and borderline gaudy we wish you no harm we come in peace. Ithing the noises are grate Italian cars make beautiful sound and noise remember when a Italian lady speaks we thing ow wow how nice! Here I my country southe Africa we cannot race all the same because of the money bud remember a few people have the Porsche 911 a few people push through a frarri and a few people push through a golden lamborghini whois faster we’ll Ican tell you with blessed ease that a vw golfer mark 1 with engine and angineturbo will always be the faster one or even a m3. I especially like when you used your own name in the words of saying if someone says the Porsche sounds best then they too are mad Watson! You look grate Mat I prefer your face and I also wish to look at Yanni’s face some more even if it’s for a short while. We have been waiting for this movie to come out and to see your face as graceful as you are a day without your face is like a radio no knob how can you change stations? Bless you and peace to thee.
Respect to the Porsche
Crazy Porsche
I wish that Lambo has a dct!!! It should smoke all of them!!
I think Porsche is the best 😃
Considering the fact that the ferrari is the heaviest and  rwd, it did pretty well from a dig. Still the fastest car though when launch is out of the picture, walked the porsche and svj not sure what u guys are watching haha.
Porsche this days start to be more cool. Is like wine
we want yanni in every race.....  he is so cute.....
Porsche are the Scientist choice. The other two are the fanboys choice.
Iam underestimating Porsche 😆
German engineering at its best  Porsche all the way
Porsche
The Porsche definitely won the sound test
You guys need to do a road trip special Route 500 in Scotland would be good! 😉👍🏽
The car with no engine sound won, this is everything repugnant about modern cars, no sound, just blows from the blowers. Give me the slowest car please.
Porsche all day long
Lambo all the way
i would go for the porsch all day every day
Another Blitzkrieg Victory for Porsche!😎  Yesss! THAT's Görmän Engineering!😊
I’ll love to have the lambo first
Só faltou 3 pilotos de verdade!!
Ferrari
Porsche is better
That Porsche just proved work hard in silence and let the success make Noice 🔥🔥
porsche all day!!!
Porsche not my best, but porsche always doing more with less
Hands down would have the Ferrari. Never ever liked the Lambo style. So over the top.
It's pronounced Porsche not Porsch
I’ll take the Ferrari Z06
The Porsche killed it even though yanni cheated as per usual
Ferrari 812 my dream car 😍😍
Bollix! 🤣
812 super fast anyday😂
Loboghinini adventador svg i love it
SVJ - no question. The Porsche just, needs work to make it feel as alive as the others.
Ferrari rev
Lamborghini
I would rather have the LAMBO instead of the other 2 cause its got passion and character written all over the car!
Grande Ferrari... V12!!
I'll take the Ferrari 812 👍🏼  Ferrari and Porsche have more timeless design, Lambo is more aggressive but as soon as that goes out of style, and it will eventually, Ferrari and Porsche will be the better classics.
Porsche
Porsche everyday , all day 😆
porsche rips
Wow!!! PORSCHE 911 Turbo S....thank you for making me proud again...a 3.8 litre roasting 6.5 litres at almost half the price...
FYI in Emilia Romagna where Ferrari/Lamborghini are, they don't speak with that typical South Italian accent!
Half the zylinders, half the price 💪🏻
We need that Lambo to vs the Tesla Model S
He didn't just do an Italian accent 🤣
We want a video in Italian accent 🤣🤣🤣❤️
Well I have a hyundai i30N, it's a good machine 😁 but if I have to choose between that 3 cars I would pick the porsche every day 💪
that Italian accent cracked me up 😂😂🤣🤣
Ferrari quote the dry weight @ 1525kg
812 then 911
Dear try dodge viper (rolling race) will be intersting .. with stock car can reach 330km
812, svj and 911turbo s and y guys didnt take times of 0-300km/h or 0-200mph.... where is the v box and complete numbers.  1/2mile time as well.
God that 911 is fast, you can´t beat german efficiency, I don´t think that anything except of the holy trinity can be quicker (918, Laferrari, P1), it would be interesting to pitch it against the other german monster, and I am not talking about cars, but the S1000RR superbike.
This is why I love Porsche they are so insanely quick
Of course the 812 superfast
Ferrari looks better
that 812 superfast is so sexy
I've seen that Lambo in Cardiff twice! I dont really feel for the number on the side though, looks a bit Gumball
lambo
ferrari is just better in everything
Yanni cheated AGAIN!!!!
Very nice
812 ofc
Porsche is incomparable, it is truly beast as always❤❤❤❤❤
I would have the Ferrari
Porsche anytime ✌️✌️
Definitely the Porsche.  Not only is it the best from a statistical standpoint but you can drive it around town with class, style, and refinement unlike those other goofy looking things.  AND, you would have enough money left over for the insurance bill.
Ferrari
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ  Every time.
Porsche is a beautiful car, makes no sense when people say it doesn’t look good 🤔
Yea Ferrari 812 superfast brooo I love ferrari
LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR All Day and Night
Here you can see again German engineering  is the best in the world 🇩🇪❤️
tell yanni ans matt that sound doesnt matter but speed does
The 911 doesn't even care. It's like meh, I can thrash you all without even making any fuss or sound about it 😪
Yani always cheat like a kid
I almost forgot that the Porsches is involved in this drag race
svj  12:06
No matter which car wins in the race . My Love towards Lambo, never ends
Rip Chadwick Boseman guys 😔
Yianni is really starting to ruin these drag races for me
When the introvert beats the loudmouths
The Porsche would sound the best if it wasnt a modern car with a shitty softlimiter...
The sheer panic on yiannis face when he saying uh oh 😂😂😭
That Porsche is insane, it wins on every drag race
Porsche all the way every day not just summer special days
Lambooooooo
porsche: the quiet kid that shows its true colors
Does the soft limited ruin the fun in both Park and Neutral?
Porsche!! its practical
Finally some nice paint job on a Lambo 🙌
I'd have the Porsche any day
Yainni is so funny He saw he was loosing to the Ferrari 😂😂😂
I’ll take the Ferrari or the lambo every day of the week even just for the sound, it’s like driving a f1 car
Porsche, mate. All day, all night :)
Lambo svj
Being these the types of cars they are, I think you should really consider adding a half mile race.
All that money spent for slow bravado
Porsche....every single day
I liked the accents. Just made the video cooler
The Ferrari is mint I like it
L A M B O R G H I N I . . .
I would have the Porsche!!!!😁😎
8:56 Yianni killed me😂😂😂
I would like to have the king of the drug race -Porsche 911 Turbo S of course.
Damn I guessed it right it was Yianni
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ🔥
Matt, you're not missing out if Ferrari  doesn't let you borrow any car. ;)
Ferrari, its beautiful, its sporty, its comfortable, and most importantly its Italian. Who else agree with me
Porsche. All day.
Porsche funniest car 💀😂😂
812 superfast no doubt
Is there a particular reason Lamborghini haven't bothered updating to a dual clutch in the Aventador's life time?
It's a "Super Fast" Ferrari, not "Super quick". XD
812 or 911 like the looks more, don't really like the extremely sharp lines of the lamborghini
Porsche, sorry Yianna
You should fly in the grand tour Nissan Patrol
Instead of prosche we needed mclaren 720
Ferrari!
Lmfao when yianni leaned his head forward was hilarious 😂😂😂😂😅
ain't the turbo S cheapest of the bunch?
I prefer to have the Porsche.
That ferrari looks gorgeous😍
911 all day
911 turbo s is better.....🥰🥰🥰
812 over the svj all day
atleast yani didnt win
Porsche too OP and it’s cheaper
Lambo all day
I'd definitely get the lambo
Taking the Ferrari. Lambo ain't shit.
“That moves like a Panda” cries in my Panda 100HP
Please use time stamps, carwow
If there is a start, yanni will jump it
Der Gerät liefert einfach ab
Just saw leaked images of 992 GT3RS..... sooo Hyped man.
the porsche always be the benchmark
If that fatty&married Yanni gains 10 kilos more then he will never beat Matt again.😅
I like the SVJ
I think the Porsche sounds the best...
I think Porsche and Bugatti are the only super cars that you can use a suit and go to work and when you come back you can wear a short and go to golf club.   Both are not that aggressive and they don’t make noise
Porsche 911 TS all the way without a shout of a doubt.
7:02 its obvious Mat cheated!
Ferrari looks better by a mile
Jajaja is awesome how he said "defeated"
Yianne : Lambo all day everyday   After losing...  Porsche : I’m the all day everyday 😂🔥
3 cars races with yianni and matt is always just between yianni and matt third car doesnt matter if they win or lose 😂😂
911
812
Tbh I think the lambo did start a bit early on the first run
That porsche... But i pick the lambo anyway 🙃
Yanni an Matt havin their battle ... meanwhile the Porsche "you 2 alright back there?" 😂
thats german quality💪
I’m just here to listen to the 812🤤
Yianni may have pushed his head forward like a sprinter during the race, but, I think a more apt description would be a long jumper with all of those starts 😂
listen mat, yiannie is always cheating you...he always launches a second ahead...Anyway look at the 911...what's he point of 12 cylinders??😂😂
Yani jumped the start. again
me: SVJ 🤩🤤🤤🤤🔥🔥🔥, then 911, then Ferrari. 😎
The Porsche is the one to have..
Porsche - Bayen Lamborgini - barcelona Ferrari - Juventus   We know who won.#CL2020
Just to remind you that when there’s a Turbo s in the race you are automatically fighting for 2nd place:)
Please bring in the Bugatti
The 911 is mind blowing!!
Nice reporting #techaltitude go through it
My car also has 7 speed dual clutch which means my car is also a ferrari
Porsche 911 turbo the bargain hypercar. I would have the Porsche because I could use it and its power everyday without it breaking after 3 months. Porsche just tell us how much power the car really makes because your claimed numbers are a bit off...as usual.
992 turbo S rules
720s vs svj vs huracan performante  Maybe not the huracan tho
Lambo and Ferrari all show no go...Porsche 911 Turbo S kicking ass as always 😜😁
The gt rs Porsche’s are gonna be problematic 👀🔥
Porsche made in germany
Hahahahaha
i wanna have the Porsche!!
Lamborghini the best looker of the three.
Porsche 911 Turbo!!!
I would have the svj Its my dream car
Ferrari
Lamborghini
All of them sir.
So... can we talk about how that Turbo S beat a SVJ and an 812 in all 3?
why does porsche have to do everybody dirty 😂
What ferrari and Lamborghini can't do is to use them like a daily car like Porsche
porsche 911 turbo s
Sportowa Polska
The Porsche : Action speaks better than sound 😂🔥
Had to put my ear at the speaker because the porche was so quiet
PORSCHE TEAM THAT'S MY BOY!  Seriously, the Ferrari did well for a rear-wheel, and the most interesting part is that a Porsche isn't made for straight line, this isn't where she's the best
That was the most exciting vid I’ve seen in ages👍 @Yianni @MatWatson masterclass in entertainment 😂😂😂
Posche i like but power
That Porsche is no joke <3
Ferrari sounds better in my opinion but doesn't race better 😂😂
I’m convinced that Porsche underrated their horsepower and torque.
Jump start from Yanny
And yet again can any car beat the 911 in that price bracket? Or shall I say even double the price of a 911? No chance it’s THE LEGEND and THE BEST 😀 PORSCHE YOU ARE AMAZING 👍
Ferrari  sounds the best
I’m waiting for it it is Jeep trackhawk vs Tesla model x vs Mercedes amg g63 vs Lamborghini urus
Porsche power ferarri noob lombogini pro
If I won lottery I would go stright to buy new 911 turbo s🤩
Race 7:00
Lambo always
The 812 looks the best
The super fast it’s the best looking in my opinion
The spec on that 812 🤤🤤
I would have the Ferrari
That 911 turbo s is a serious beast 💖
Where is the drag race that I wanted
id get the porsche 100%, but the 812 did really well for being rwd. the lambo looks like something a child would draw
Ok that lambo is f***ing beautiful
The 911 Turbo S, is great!!!
Nice race between lambo and ferrari,porsche is just a camera car to capture action from up front..
I would have the Porsche for sure!
F*ck if the 720s was ther ????
Porsche all the way ... ! 🇩🇪💯
I knew 200 kilos would make that difference.
I will take the porsche
All american race please: Ford Shelby GT500 vs Dodge Hellcat Redeye vs Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 vs Chevrolet Corvette
Ferrari 812 superfast all the way
That fucking 911 has absolutely no business going that fast. Porsche is just the king of kings.
Aventador and ferrar na v12 i just way cooler than boring 6 cylinder turbo
812 is gorgeous.. ❤️💪😍
Yianni is the best!😂😂big respect to the Porsche, wow!
Lambo
Porsche
Enzo Ferrari: aerodynamics are for people who can’t build engines.  Well...
Yannie that is not warming the tyres that is roasting them
I wonder how can a Porsche wins against tow fast super cars!!!! The name of super car should be revised after this race !!!
A porsche is a porsche is a porsche....
The feud between the two won't end anytime soon. Well done 911😁
You guys are doing a great job making the Porsche look like the monster it is.  You need to start bringing some serious hardware.
Would take the Prosche just because its a Deutsches Auto!
Didn't know the 911 was electrict
That's not good Italian talking ... Per favore! 🇮🇹
Ferrari all the way
Ningún automóvil desde hace muchos años derrota al 911 turbo s. Y así seguirá. Porsche lo mejor.
Can’t afford any, but if I could, I’d buy the 911 Turbo S
They didn't even talk to the Porsche guy hahahaha.
Damn Yanni’s reaction does give the lambo more horses
Bro Yanni should race on huracan .Because aventadors don't change gears quickly
The Aventador backing off from "single-clutch uniqueness" desperately needs DCT.
Porsche every time i see thing silver beauty ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Porsche 911 turbo
3 minutes of talking and talking.. 😴😴
should of been the gt2
I’d take the Ferrari in a heartbeat, without question.
the Porsche just doesnt give a shit
Best race ever
Obviously the Porsche won
Porsche all the way .............................................................
Porsche it's my choice
The lambo sounds the best
Why wouldn’t you take the Porsche 🤷🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️
German engineering babies ;)
Porsche didn't even warm it's tires
The Porsche 😍
812 super fast it is
"work hard in silence, let your success make the noise' Porsche with soft noise limiter
X 2 ..I'd get the lambo, sell it, buy a 911, and keep the rest.....IT'S Porsche all day long
Yianni: *does donuts like a pro* Mat: "hooligan"
Lambo: I'll win Porsche: hold my soft limiter😂
Lambbbbbboooooo
I love how irrelevant the Porsche is even tho it’s the best out of the three 😂😢🤦🏻‍♂️
812>>>
Lambo
Without even thinking i prefer lamborghini svj, but if i ever have the chance to have either the ferrari or the porsche i wouldnt mind driving them
Ferrari
Ferrari and Lambo: Lets Race!! Porche: Hold my 3.8l flat 6
812 but GTS is my choice.
Porsche All day price to performance!
The Porsche sounded better and down voting means you're actually upvoting and approving this message.
ferrari all the way, imagine having AWD it would smash them also in drag race.
Ropey Speedo on that ferrari
Lamborghini: But who has that Nürburgring production car lap record though? Porsche: ....  Ferrari: ....  I'm not hating on the other cars btw I just saw most of everyone in the comments talking down on the Lambo, so I was like might as well post this 😆
If it's a gift, I'll take the Lambourghini,  sell it, then buy the far superior Porsche.  The money left I will use to combat the growing problem we have in Britain and also, by far the biggest killer of men in this country. Suicide. Peace all
Porsche 911 Turbo S.
Ferrari bro :D
I have my phone layin down fullscreen... I keep scrolling up to get the options and I see that I've already liked the video...  I am barely 3 minutes in!
Porsche 🥵🥰
Porsche
Porsches are made using ancient German black magic.
Porsche 911 Turbo S(ilent) Killer
Daddy getting risky. Fuck hot.
Porsche
I have the 911 turbo s
Sums up F1: Germans 1st, Italians last
8:56, sulky little, adorable kid. AWWWW! 🤣
the master: Porsche
Porsche
Ferrari looks the best but I'll take the Porsche, thanks. Also the SVJ hasn't got a DCT because it doesn't fit- the gearbox is in the centre tunnel between the seats and a DCT wouldn't fit in there (as explained by Jeroen, Lambo test driver).
carwow > New Top Gear
Lambo
I'd get the lambo so i can sell it and buy a Ferrari and a porsche 😅
Why was Yianni out there driving a door wedge?
I would go for the ferrari
Is everyone gonna ignore that yianni is wearing the t shirt of an irish crisp company?
That grey thing in the back "siletnly" doing its calculated thing for 60-70% of the price. It's not even funny. 😳🤣🤣
All you need is PORSCHE
The Porsche was just : what Ferrari, what Lambo?
At 10:48 his hand was shivering 😂 of fear that the wheel got popped😂
812 and svj
And that’s why I cancelled my SVJ & 812. Lol. Turbo S 👑 👑 👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑
Porche
Svj ❤️
At this point they are just using the turbo s to have a better look at other cars in the drag race.
Lamborghini
Flat 6 is worth it
I'd have the porsche but think the lambo is best looking of the three.
Porsche
Try to do a dragrace with a koenigsegg regera and the other hypercars 🙌🏻😜👌🏻
5:02 I’d be mad if someone did that to my Lamborghini
For the money that Porsche is waay more better than the other two 😂😂
That german imitation on point😂
If money was no object I'd go for a 918
Porche 911
The Ferrari is so pretty though
Porsche win every race hhhhh
Yanni, get that SVJ spec is on point
Porsche is this father 💪
Porsche FOR EVEEERRRRR!!!!!!!! Best engineering
Lamborghini Avendator SVJ all day along
That porsche is F!! Fast
F12TDF
i love these fast car races, but please line up some slow car races.  they are just as fun if equal!
Porsche no.1 !!!!!!!!!! 🤩
I'd buy the Porsche, no question. Over 100k cheaper, the fastest, safest and in my opinion, even the best looking car. The Ferrari and the Lambo are just over the top and attention seeking, while the Porsche is even useable as a daily driver.
Second time yanni didn't jumo so it was close i think lambo and rari are evenly matched
Porsche killed it 🙏🏽
Lamborghini is for the poor people of Saudi Arabia. Absolutely trash of a company. Take your Audi else where.
faster than the SF1000
Aventador's problem is the gearbox
Lambor... Yianni enters the chat
As a 47 y/o man, I'd take the Porsche any day, hands down.
I would rather the 911, its understated and clearly the better car as Matt attests to and of course the most iconic sports car in the world... Imagine the slaughter if it was a GT2... 😳
Lol I loved the intro
Porsche every day of the week. Best all rounder. The other a good as well but if you want a car that is super fast and go out to the shops in then its the Turbo S.
So bad they only Talk about Ferrari and Lamborghini... Bit the old Good German Porsche will all Runs 😁
The ferrari looks *NICE*
The drag race of all drag races! Nice one Matt
911
Literally my absolute favorite 3 super cars from my 3 favorite super car manufacturers
Porshe all day
Can anyone explain why the Porsche won?
that porsche is insane mate. 3.8 that have 650 hp. thats scary
Cachorro bravo fica quieto, quieto, cachorro manso, late, late, late. By: Rincón Sapiência.
Germans logic,  half of cylinders , faster from 0 than those superstars.. bravo Porsche . I just love how that Ferrari looks 😍
Porsche
Yianni is the funniest person I’ve ever seen
Porsche is PoWeR
So how much power does the Porsche actually have
Lamborghini svj
509 dislikes are from the *triggered prosciutto bruschetta parmigiano-reggianos and bratwurst sauerkrauts* 😂😂
I'll take 911 Turbo. Then with the balanced saved get a tune for it.
Porsche is a beast. Better value for money against any super car. Is there anything that can beat it
porsche is a cheat code tbh, screwing cars double its money
Порш всех нахлобучил!! 💪 и стоит как две ламбы! Зачем платить больше?
That Porsche is so impressive....i know the body style is older than most people watching this but still kicking butt and taking impressive names.
The Ferrari won this comparison just after the sound check haha
What's sad is I already know that Porcshe will win before I've even watched the video.
911 Turbo s king of the 1/4 mile
Haha the accents he made are ridiculously good 🤣
Porsche all day
Porsche 911 ✌🏼
I came here to see Porsche whoop ass. Not disappointed 😂
Porsche Turbo S all day
I love this video :)
I'd take the turbo S
Amazingly i think the porsche 911 turbo would be my choice given i normally dont like porsche. Just the best all round car.
U made my day Mat😉!
Only time fake
ferrai forever
Hey Matt, you remind me of the Super Nerd from The Chase lol 😂👍
Common sense in the real world says Porsche then the lambo then the Ferrari but the inner child says lambo because it’s loud and bonkers, fuck the neighbours
I have never imagined that this day would come for Carwow.  I never knew I needed this as bad as I did!  This is the ULTIMATE drag race for me!! ALL THREE OF THESE CARS ARE MY ULTIMATE FAVORITES!!!! NO DAMN JOKE!
Lambo
Lamborghini
Porsche actually
you aced the itallian accent!
Porschelicious ...
Beautiful video😍
That combined soundddd ❤️❤️❤️
German engineering at its finest 👌
Fun fact: Porsche and Ferrari actually have the same horse, both originated from Stuttgart.   https://stpaul.porschedealer.com/why-are-the-porsche-and-ferrari-logos-similar/
For me has to be the Porsche 👍👍😉😉
Are we NOT going to say anything about Yianni jumping the first drag race. !!
Boy that Porsche is a beast
How does this porsche win i cant stand it.
Porsche, any day
Porsche 911
I would buy the aventador svj
Porsche is the best
Lamborghini aventidor SVJ
La Ferrari e la lambo sono fantastiche
Porsche 911 TURBO S. All day, eveeeryyyydayyy :)
Porsche. There is no substitute.
if you have a v12 lamborghini aventador SVJ or a v12 ferrari 812, it doesn't really matter if a turbocharged 6 cylinder porsche 911 is faster. because no matter how fast that porsche goes, he can never match the symphony of a v12 (a symphony that forever will be missed when extinct)
Ferrari's V12 is a masterpiece. One of the greatest engine considering all emission laws
Porsche is the best
911 the best
812 is my dream car
ferrari looks over lambo looks imo
I would take the Ferrari but Lambo is better looking for a supercar
Porshe
That sound from Lambi....mmmm.
Stupid idiot in the Lamboghini...He's always making a false start.
I’d take that Ferrari even if it is “Superslow” I love that car 😍
Porsche its subtle classy and lets its actions speak for it 😉 👌
Porsche💓
Love the accents lol
Porshe ❤️
Yanni is the type of guy at school who does bad things but the teacher doesnt care about since its a daily routine
Porche german🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's just Porsche ))
i have all 3 cars plus laferrari  but i love the Porsche as it is faster and better
Lambhorgini drivers acts like if he is a teen age boy...!
Porscheee all day!!!😍❤️
I can clearly see the porse is better in every way...why I dont want one tho
Porsche 911 turbo S is my Dream car😍
Go on and put more Ads to your video , you can do it !
Porsche is the best
My brain says Porsche. It‘s incredibly effective but my heart melts everytime when I see  an 812. It has a much more seductive and beautiful design, and is the absolute business in black.   The specs are also incredible.  I really don‘t care for the Lamborghini.
Go on the Porsche.. Almost a third of the price. Compared to the Lambo!! Give me a Porsche any day!!! All the others.. Don't believe the hype!!!
Порше просто пууушка 😎👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🚀
Got to be Ferrari for me
Porsche 🤯😍 lambo and ferraris are for kids
Well, this sure is awesome advertising for Porsche!
you got to respect the crazy good understatement performance of the Porsche against those other cars!!
RIP Chadwick Boseman 💔🕊
El Porsche se los comió con papas. Ahí está el nivel de ingeniería. Menos mal que no cogieron el gt2 rs 🤣🤣
Lambo lambo lambo
Turbo S
812 Superfast any day of the week. Much classier than the shouty lambo
Subtitle indonesia
Why do we even have the rolling race in comfort mode. Who races in comfort mode anyways?
Absolutely Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Please 720 s mclaren. Vs. aventador sv vs 812 super fast
Just goes to show you how rigged the engine of the year award is. The Pista engine has NOTHING on that Porsche.
Porsche every day💪🏼
812 Superfast for sure. The SVJ just an Audi with more power. It's an Audi SVJ
Lambo
Lambo and Ferrari: I got the best sounding v12 and 700+ hp lol try me   Porsche: haha flat six go turbo
Ferrari❤️
tHe pORsChe SOunDeD  dA bEsT
SVJ
Porche 💯💯 out of the 3!!
Ferraris unique sound ♨️
I am with Lamborghini
Porsche just insane, oh my god 😭
Aventador for me so I can sell it and by two Porsche’s
that shaver of a shifter is just unacceptable for the porsche ...
Best sounding video I’ve heard!
SVJ
Porsche is my passion
Team Ferrari
man i cannot wait for the gt2 rs
Can we appreciate how that Porsche is killing all the supercars?
We don't talk like this Maaaaatt :/  Aaahhhh Turbo S <3
Id take the SVJ sell it buy an rs3  and keep whatever left
I see a 911 Turbo S driver & think man he's cool. The other cars are just fashion trinkets against that 911! Cost more but will get dropped in the real world by a Turbo S!
id go for the porsche
SVJ
Turbos s... Its james bond in a tux 🙏🙏🙏
the 911 turbo s just built different
That Porsche is a weapon...
Sorry, I would still have the Porsche!!!
You don't care about the porche because you know it will kick your ass.
Porsche is just a beast.. insane
I think that 812 is much more classy and sleek than SVJ because of the SVJ streamline was obstructed by its spoiler, had it been removed, it will be better looking than before. Meanwhile Porsche do what they do, silently but dominating everyone before they realized it too late to notice Porsche was ahead of you.
911
Definitely Porsche
812
Porsche all day every day...
6:42 mat has a voice crack 😂
I'll take the ferrari. It's the most beautiful to me , it's fast enough, it's comfortable, it sounds like a F1.
Never been more hype watching a video!
I'd rather have the wambogini
911
I love the ferrari but the porsche just atracție to you
Lambo
Why you never put a camera inside of Porsche?????
Porsche is always the best. And ofc i will own a Porsche but Ferrari sounds the best
7:01 Matt jumped the start!
I want Porsche ♥️
a peugoet driver : maniac 😒
Ferrari Superfast 😍
LMFAO THE WAY THE PORSCHE JUST GLIDES BY🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Porsche 💪💪💪💪
The Porsche : actions speak louder than words haha 😆
Porsche 911 turbo s is more elegant
Porsche: let me show you on how to tune a car. (Lambo/ferrari)
Porsche
One Porsche.....please
Porshe 911 turbo s 🎯🎯🎯🎯
that porsche man 🔥
Best moment is at 1:03 mins 👌
Give me two of the porsches instead of one svj please, thanks.
porsche always drag king
Go around a corner and the svj wins ez
Porsche 911 Turbo s💪💪
Porsche 911 The Legend
Ferrari super slow vs Porsche......I swear Germans are in a league of their own
If I would be given one of those 3 with no other financial support, I would take the 911. Else I would be severely split personality between the SVJ and the Superfast.
So 911 and a house over pony and ox it is
Ferarri sounds better
Yianni after losing the roll race: *angry downshifting*
What the hell Germans put in porshe !
911 Turbo S is the quiet kid in class.. Not noisy, no need to warm-up. Still can kick-ass
I would love to see drag race between RS7 v M8 v CLS AMG or VR6 battle between Corrado v Golf v Passat v Vento/Jetta
Porsche.
Lambo💪❤️
I bet Mat was doing donuts when warming up the tires. Then edited it out when the tire pressure gauge broke 😂
I’m actually Italian and that accent made me become gay Matt
It felt like the ultimate battle to proof what Porsche has done. What a car...
Porsche GT2 RS would potential win angainst the Turbo S
I would rather keep   my corsa D 1.2 sxi  !!! because I like driving a 86 hp gutless unpowered  boring piece of tin on wheels.  All them cars are fantastic.  I say good luck and enjoy  to anyone who owns such cars like those.
Why is nobody talking about how the turbocharged porsche beat the NA cars in the first rolling race (I know it wasnt in the sportiest mode but still...)
I would buy Ferrari but Porsche is far better. I bet it could make better lap record also. Well done Porsche 👍👏
That Porker is silent and deadly
Money not an object... I’d still have the Porsche. Money is real though so, even better. Bravo Porsche, king of the road.
Damn sure Porsche smashes the competition 🤙🏻
Aventador is for people who wants to show off.  Ferrari is for people with class.  Porsche is for people who wants performance in a daily car.   I will choose Porsche, then Ferrari. In a Lambo I would feel like a douche.
Aventador vs aventador s vs aventador sv vs aventador svj ?
911 is op
Porsche 911 turbo S,..🏁
You are cool
Money no object I’d have the Porsche all day every day. Looks smart, more practical and outrageous performance. That Ferrari sounds and looks amazing too
5:04 Yiannis focusing face
PORSCHE IS THE GOAT🔥
0:00 you should have to say: Bella a tutti ragazzi
So no Lamborghini/Audi jokes with Yianni in the house right? Smart move Mat :)
Let's wait till the TDF version of the 812 launches.
I love Yiani man, he should be in every video 💯
That Porsche is a smart discreet monster 💨
"That's enough plugs, let's get on with  the race" 2 seconds later: "Buying a new car? Head to carwow to get offers from the UK's top dealers"
When a 911 Turbo is in a race its no longer the battle for 1st for anyone else
This Porsche is a joke
When you guys really run out of YouTube materials...
That ferrari is the best looking car
Lambo all the way because when I drive by, I will have noise cancelling headphones sell out !
porsche is the better car mate
AT THE FIRST RACE LAMBORGINI STOLE BEFORE THE GIRL DOWN HER HANDS
silent and steady always wins the race  -porsche 911
At 12;02 I would rather have Mat's car
911 turbo s. For me.... But best looking is the Lambo
Italians - all show no blow ! Keep up making pasta, leave mechanics to the Germans - it’s in their blood
Porsche,  un disputed king of sport cars. Head to head with cylider bloated brutes and win so elegantly. Love this piece of art.
I would definitely go for the porsche , and the ferrari as well to some extent, but not the aventador  even if it is made out of gold. Lamborghini fan boys please dont hate me.....
So when do you show the 918 or the 918 RSR??
Porche needs to go against some hypercars
Porsche always be my fav. Cheap, realiable and fast.
992 TurboS
Porsche
Moral of the story, get the Porsche and a macabre for the wife for the price of the bull or Horse
Germany car 💪🏻 metade do motor e mais potente !!!
That Porsche is pretty
Bad Boys Wheel ..
Why don't you tell the actual hp numbers for the 812.. The 812 has 789 horsepower. Which would make the aventador 19 less horsepower. Not 30
So funny how much competitive the guy in the lambo is hahaha
Imagine porsche having 6.5 engine. It would be a rocket
The Porsche is just fucking nuts....
its basically just a porsche
Who wants to see the world's greatest drag race on CARWOW???
Ferrari 812 SF
Maybe the oooo RS3 can be that Ferrari too. Way to go Porsche
Farrier
Can you race against the Grand Tour Trio: James May, Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and the Sig, please?
In reality the Porsche tho 💯
The 911 sounds better
Racist begin
That porche is on another level...
Yiani jumped the start!!!!
Die Deutschen bauen die besten Fahrzeuge der Welt.  The Germans build the best cars.
911
lamb sounds exquisite. That v12 never fails to pleasure
Porsche <3
The race I been waiting for!
I think the aerodynamics of aventador is just  gig...look the Porsche design way more simple and Porsche just made the other two slow....
Money no object all 3
Porsche 911 turbo s
I'd have Porsche all day every day❤🚘
These videos are getting better and better recently. CARWOW and Matt are going places
Of course, the Porsche!
Isn't it a bit rude to do burnouts in someone else's Lambo?
Definitely Porsche
Even without this video the Porsche is by far the best car. The others are just poser.
Please can anyone explain me how is Porsche winning each drag race? All answers are welcome but please try to answer techniclly what's going on here.
Nobody talking about how yanni clearly jumped off the line before she put her hands down in the first race nah?
“Enough plugs”... “Head to CARWOW”
I’ve never met a man who, even when doing an Italian accent, still manages to sound dead Brummie.
Lamborghini svj looks the best
Gimme the 812
i'll go for porsche
porsche  911 turbo s
Matt jumped the second try. He started  before she start to put her hands down. Clearly jumped the start!
БЕЗУМНО КРУТО!!!!! ОЧЕНЬ КРУТЫЕ БОМБИЧЕСКИЕ И ПУШЕЧНЫЕ МАШИНЫ И ТАЧКИ!!!! КРУТЕЙШИЕ И САМЫЕ МОИ ЛЮБИМЫЕ АВТОМОБИЛИ!!!!! Я ОБОЖАЮ, ИНТЕРЕСУЮСЬ И ОЧЕНЬ СИЛЬНО УВЛЕКАЮСЬ АВТОМОБИЛЯМИ!!!!!!! Я МЕЧТАЮ О МАШИНЕ!!!!! ВСЁ ЭТО АБСОЛЮТНАЯ ЧЕСТНАЯ ПРАВДА!!!!!
The svj is perfect
German power🇩🇪
I get 2 Porsche’s for the Lamborghini 😂 so in any case two Porsche’s
ADVENTADOR SVJ
How can the Lamborghini be that slow? We know the ferrari is slower
Svj for sure . I'm an audi and lambo fan boy
Great voiceacting 👌👌👌
If this was an olympic 100m sprint, that Porsche would get an immediate call for a blood test from WADA!    #alientechnology
Ferrari is the best looking!! 💖
Lamborghini any day😍
Do OVER. I want to see what they are doing in the porch! If they are manually shifting then that is unfair. Because they are not in the Lambo and the Ferrari. Be transparent please.
Porsche as incredible as ever!! Budget beast 😂
" Everybody is EXPENSIVE untill the INEXPENSIVE arrives " 😂😂
Lamborghini SVJ :)) 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The Ferrari is a beauty
All that ever matters to Yiani is beating Mat
I think the ferrari 812 looks better
I love svj
Lambo any day
I expected the porsche to win on roll races also.. but ferrari is just fast once its moving!
Pooooor Yanni! 😆  Indeed Porsche Turbo 2021 is a beast. Personally I prefer Ferrari Superfast concerning design but I recognise is really a super supercar at 720 McLaren level... good job guys! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻
If I HAD THE FREAKING MONEY TO BUY ANY OF THOSE WHICH APPARENTLY I DONT  I would choose that Porsche and change the exhaust cuz that exhaust was like umokay?
Now, even if money wouldn't matter, i'd still go for the cheapest car, the Porsche 911 Turbo S. I think all those cars look good, but i just like it the most🤷‍♀️ Also you can fix that missing sound by installing an aftermarket exhaust
Porsche I’ve always loved Porsche’s
Porsche all day!! Turbo goodness!
Porsh
That Porsche has a smaller engine, less horsepower and it’s still smoking the Lambo and Ferrari  That is insane!!!!!
Yianni is so hilarious when he is about to lose 🤣
Porsche is quiet but deadly asf  But f*ck it i freakin love that ferrari its so gorgeous and sounds like an f1
I would have the Porsche.They simply makes the best cars in the world. End of discussion.
No meaning of drag racing with standard mod
Ferrari
Yiannimize should be the one always racing you coz hes a good driver brings out the best out of the car win or lose
0:00 typical English person stereotyping the Italian language x)  Of course, this was said as a joke 😂
Ferrari all day every day
Turbo S is an assassin!
I like how Yianni jumped the start and still lost to the Porsche 🤣
Wow 911 turbo is amazong So i wonder gtr nismo vs 812 vs svj vs 911 turbo
I would have the lambo
Definetly the 911 turbo s
Yanni couldn't win, even by jumping the start
Blindly choose the porche
Porsche ooh Porsche, very reliable, good design and come w rational price
I love how enthusiastic yainni is about carwow drag races😂
Ferrari
PORSCHE FOR THE WIN
Imagine paying 260 000+ just to lose😂😪
i will still buy that porsche.. that performance is something else and is just stock... for that price and putting 50k on top you've got and nearly hypercar that the FEFE or Lambo are tho, im a racer guy cant help it :)
Lambo looks the best by far!
Yanni takes his races too seriously 😂
For a second i thought I'm in the wrong channel, one of the translated channels.
Matt is literally the best car reviewer. Period
Porsche 911 Turbo even though that I am a Ferrari and AMG driver...
To everyone that's reading this: You're a very intelligent and understanding human! Stay healthy and at peace during Quarantine! My dream is to hit 1k subscribers and I'm struggling to get there, so if this made you happy, please put a smile on my face too ❤️
Porsche all day. You could spend the saved cash tuning it. It doesn't have to be loud and lairy because it's always in front. The only thing I'd consider is a McLaren. But German quality in the Porsche wins.
Tht ferrari ooh!!
if i need to buy a car under 30,000 pounds what do i buy
Can we have a Bugatti vs that Porsche 😭
Porche
Zio cane la pronuncia It's ferrari non ferrrrrrrrari it's Lamborghini  SVj non laborgini  svij
Porsche was like I’ll let my speed do the talking 😅
*Yanni finnishes w/ 2nd last place but wins Matt* Yanni: LET'SS GOOO
a wise man would choose Porsche
Ferrari or Porsche
Yani and his cars are so chav
One of the best drag races ever!
Can some1 explain how did porsche win with less hp?:)
I would buy the PORCHE
koenigsegg regera vs bugatti chiron  this would be epic
360k lambo destroy by 160k porche... What you "lol", this lambo and ferrari just sucks
FINALLY THEY RACE WITH THE SVJ!!!!!
the 911 🤐🤐🤐🤐
So things which are loud sound better than things which are poised and silent. The world we live in.
Lamborghini is what I would have because as I go people will be dephened
Porsche indeed
Before even watching this video I’m choosing the Porsche. No doubt it wins.
The 812 Superfast and Aventador SVJ has more than 700hp, but can barely full ahead of the 992 Turbo S in the roll race. The 720s does it easily.
1 : Porsche 🇩🇪 2:  Ferrari  🇮🇹  3:  Lamborghini 🇮🇹
I prefer lambo
The Porsche is literally like that quiet kid who silently sits in the corner when the big mouths boast away abt how well they did in the test.
The Porsche is 100% the best car in all aspects ( even looks )
Ferrari sounds good
porche
Sound test reminds me an ancestor word in Turkish “The shit of a fast-running horse falls far between (infrequently)”
Turbo s wins for suuurreeeee!!!!!!!
812 superfast
Ferrari all the way, absolutely stunning
Man this is hilarious. How the hell the lowest HP and quietest beat two monsters
Porsche any day.
What the hell happened to you matt??🤣🤣
Porsche is N 1
Ferrari any day
Bugatti Chiron vs Bugatti Veyron please
This channel is clearly aimed at the kids
Omg that Porsche... Isn't it isane that you can beat cars with over 200- or 300.000£  just "only" with 156.000£
“but zvwe vill crush them”  - hitler
Porsche costs less, has less horsepower, is more reliable and is faster.  Ferrari no comment 👎
Porsche TTS.
Ferrari's look so sick in black! So much better than red.
So we could see how 720S has done well against the real monster, 911 Turbo S
Porsche
Lamborghini svj🔥🔥
Please have a kawasaki h2r or a ducati panigale   V4 vs supercar
Ferrari!  Easily the best looking and classiest.
i would have probally the prosche blacked out
Finally, we saw😍 the important person in the Matt racing 😂 6:50
Porsche best one you can buy for racing super cars
Porsche......, any question?
Porsche.... every day twice on weekends!... not to mention with a light software tune it will ....... well
porsche
Lets Just take a moment, couse the porsche is a pure beast
I am porsche guy but at this time I would take 812 sf, it is so rare v12 in elegant body. Lambo is so showy and rubish gearbox
That intro though 🤣🤣
Porsche - any time !
wish there was a 720s
Porsche 911 powerrrr
Ferrari. It’s a more refined design in my opinion whereas the Lamborghini is a f117 nighthawk on wheels. I’ve always liked Ferrari’s design better than Lamborghini and my personal favorite of the front engine group Ferrari has is the f12 berlinetta
Svj
ferrari
I'd have the Ferrari any day
Obviously porshe
1/2 the engine size .. half the cylinder count .. and it smoke them like a joint .. (high grade) ....
When I ll be seeing a koenigsegg?
long live the king
Porsche is an all round car, Ferrari is really exotic, Lamborghini is bit off the class, too childish.... it lacks the Italian style and way behind Porsche practicality and simplicity
Imagine a 100 metre race between yianni and mat You will see yianni screaming come on leg 😂😂
Anyday, all day, I would take the Lambo
I'll take the Porsche
Yanni clearly jumped the start 🤬 and im surprised Matt didn't notice it !
If money is no object SJV for all season use otherwise 911 turbo S excellent car for all season and killer performance
Porscheeeeeee  the best
All day Porsche
Yianni the man 👍👏
I'll take the p
Yianni jumped the line clearly
Carwow start procedure:  Three  Two (Yianni takes off)  One   (Matt takes off)  Go?
Ferrari and Lamborghini fans likes to make excuses for losing races
That Porsche is the bargain of the century
Lambo: I'll win. Porsche: hold my soft limiter 😂
The imitations of germans and Italians was something else🤣🤣
Loving that intro
Porsche 🤘🤘🤘🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿🇺🇿
German Engineering.
812
I hate that tucking Porsche
IMO ferrari sounds the best😎🏁🏁
I would have the SVJ for sure
The 812 is a beautiful car (love the murdered out look) -- but I'll take the 911 Turbo S thanks.  What's that?  "What about the Lambo?" -- Meh,....
OMGG....PORSCHE HALF THE CYLINDERS, HALF THE PRICE AND CREAMED THEM BOTH!!!! GERMAN ENGINEERING FOR YOU.
If money was no object, I’d be sold on the Turbo S. It’s such a fantastic daily.
...and that ladies and gentlemen is why Porsche is King...quite 🤫, sexy 😍, and has the unique ability to embarrass Lambo and Ferrari owners...Porsche 911 Turbo S = Masterpiece.
Porsche silent winner 🏆💪
"so what exactly happened", while getting thrashed by the humble porsche
Porsche
Porsche : "sometimes silent can be the loudest thing"
I think Yanni won drag race because he twitched while driving
720s NEXT PLEASE
:)))))
Porsche win  shame for lambo e Ferrari.
Fun fact: Yianni’s surname is CharaLAMBOus.
I would pick the Porsche turbo s cause its such an underdog
Race: Skip to 5:20 you’re welcome!
I wouldn’t look further then a Porsche 💪
Ferrari definitely looks the part. Would prefer the Porsche out the 3 purely on price.
Two V12 can't win a straight six. What a SHAME! Porshe cars are extremely fast and reliable but is underrated coz Porshe looks simple not lamborghini that look like fighter jets and ferrari that looks beautiful.
i definitely love the sound of ferrari v12 think it's my fav car
D)) Porsche 911 turbo s is the best
porsche
I'd have the Ferrari!
You are not funny 😑
As an everyday car I'd have the Porche but for the pure sound & fun I'd take the Lambo
The porsche sounds and looks boring
I’m usually a Ferrari guy but I’m not a fan of the 812. Porsche for me
Maybe I am too old, but I would pick Porsche as it looks best and is fastest. Of course, 300+ km/h speeds there becomes important displacement and Porsche can not keep up with bigger engined cars, but how often you drive 300+km/h?
Very good mat, go brazil.
Give me the 911 Turbo all day long. I have no interest I. The Lamborghini or the Ferrari.
I want to have the SVJ and then sell it to buy a Porsche
I like the ferrari the most
I prefer the Porsche
Second race: Lambo and Ferrari having a fierce battle  Meanwhile...  Porsche: Eat my dust
Bruh id rather have the SVJ just so I can sell it and buy 2 turbo s
Porsche please in black
Let’s all just be positive about the Porsche, yes it may be slower during the rolling race but it still kept up despite having less horsepower. Porsche also had a heavier body than the Lamborghini but it still won the drag race. And don’t forget it has 2 + 2 seats which means you can spend time with your kids as you go 300km/h on the autobahn
Wow you actually saw my comment on a race b/w 812 and turbo s  Thanks mat!
The only German car to kill both Ferrari and Lamborghini
911
I’d take the Porsche. I used to be a HUGE Ferrari fanboy but I would just be stressed all the time driving it around. I could drive the Porsche every day and sort of fly under the radar while destroying everything else on the road.
you should have brought the sesta elemento , then you could see the real drag race
With no doubt 💯 % 812 SuperFast
ITS CALLED PORSCHE. NOT PORSCH!!!
So here we see Lamborghini in a nutshell, most expensive, overall slowest and the most obnoxious.
I'd take that 911 Turbo S any day of the week. Just needs an exhaust!
The Ferrari is the most beautiful, but I'd own the Porsche. I prefer to drive something subdued.
Lol no taste in these brits, the ferrari sounded much better
The svj is obvious but I like to go low Soo it's the Porsche
Have the Lambo all day ..everyday
Fake
svj
Porche is the simple looking yet gorgeous, the Lamborghini is the extravagant looking and sexy, the Ferrari is opulently ravishing.
Porsche all time every time
Fane
Fake
I will rather have a Porsche 911 Turbo S and tune it to 700 hp.
Fake
Fake
It’s all about the  Porsche leaving you 2 behind.....
911 Turbo S all day everyday!!!
Turbo S
Definitely the Ferrari. Absolutely love it.
Pooooorsche!!!!!!
I choose the Porsche
I’d have the Porsche, followed by the Ferrari.......
I'm italian and this intro it's incredible😂😂😂
Can someone who knows about engines explain to me how the Porsche does this. Less displacement, kerb weight in between the two others but consistently better. How?
Why always the same old people?
Money not an object I’m having 2 Porsche 911 turbo s all day. With all the bells and whistles. A black one and a green one.   But this was an amazing drag race I just love how the turbo s be smoking everything.
I like yainni face at 9:52
No doubt Porsche
Now we know how Vettel must feel.
Porsche be like: "Guys... Can I now go to my meeting?"
I'd buy the svj.
Ferrari 812 that car has just a different vibe
Porsche Turbo S everyday. All round brilliance
lamborghini
I would have the porsche because it don't look like it but will destroy you.
Porsche won that without warming up the tiers and with less horsepower.
Lambo deffo jumped the first start
I would buy a Porsche în a heart bit. Good looking car, quiet still powerful.
That italian accent 😍 matttt wastaan
Porsche all day
Porsche all day!
Man i love when yanny is here with his lambo vibes
Yianni definitely jumped the start on the first drag race 😂
Porsche
Legendary race
We enjoyed. Thanks for this vodeo. All the cars are gorgeous. But really the Porsche suprised me.
Yanni is annoying always happy when Matt wins
Porsche all the way🏁🏁
First Race Yanni jumped the start, second Race Matt jumped the start, the Porsche diden' t even warm up the tyres and still won both races :P
that intro was pure gold!
Aventatdor is my Choice ❤️❤️
Porsche!
You should try drag race with Mahindra Thar and jimney and Jeep Wrangler
Porsche - or nothing! Maybe a RUF!
PORSCHE YOU REALLY?
Porsche leaving me with100k in my pocket
I would have the 812
German as always the best
SVJ
While the Porsche eases ahead every other day
* gets tire pressure warning * Matt: * Tells it to fuck off and proceeds to do 187mph on a bumpy runway *
porsche killed them all :)
I would pick the ferrari
SPOILER ALERT >>>> SEE THE COMMENT SECTION             FOK
Man that Porsche is invincible.  The dark horse in the room.
Porsche is the daddy - it’s only going to be toppled by the McLaren 765LT
porsche is the best
Of course the porsche
Porsche Porsche Porsche 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽🏁🏁🏁😎👍🏽
this was like those 90's movies, where the quiet guy beats every loud and obnoxious bully in town ..
As an Italian guy I really dislike that intro. Ferrari (and so all the other premium Italian cars e.g. Maserati/Lamborghini) are produced in the North of Italy (the rich part of the nation). With those gestures you are mocking up the southern italians that do not absolutely link with fast cars.
Craziest thing is that a couple grand will pull 150 hp more out of the porsche, and like 15 grand will pull another 300+.
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ for sure is the car I would take
I like the lamborgini svj becase it looks f*ck amezing
Mr Jump start Yanni. In my humble opinion the Ferrari wins the looks competition but not in  the very ‘I have no imagination all black spec’, but as they appear in the video the Porsche.
LAMBO ALL DAY
Ferrari is the best sounding, SVJ is the best supercar, Porsche is the best car.
So glad the Porsche won. Sucked in Matt and Yani
the italian accent is not accurate at all, that's the stereotype accent
German POWER
911
Actually Watson those accents were really good....
Lambo all day, every day😂
If money is no concern, Ferrari
I'll have the lambo please
That Ferrari moves like one of their 2020 F1 cars...
It’s called the 918 spyder lol
992 in every aspect
It always looks like Yanni just about jumps the start but it’s probably good reactions
Brasil na area
Porsche is like CSK. All the other makers come to beat it to get to the title
Porsche engineering is insane!
i'll take the porsche..
Do the Owners of these Super Cars ever get Upset when you guys lose with there Cars??
I say karma Porsche Respekt oh man
lamborghini
ThIs InTrO iS aMaZiNg 👌🏼🇮🇹 The Ferrari is the best looking one
Porsche
Yiannis dream : Not to be 1st . To beat Mat
How the hell is that Porsche so fast??? I'd have the Ferrarri.
PORSCHE 🥇
Aesthetically, I've always loved Lambos (Porsches are boring and Ferraris are too conservative in terms of design) but I don't like the color of Yianni's
Svj
I'm not a Posche fan but its a masterpiece of engineering 👌
Svj has too much down force, it’s not meant for this
That fat guy always jumps the gun.
Porsche all day, everyday. The other 2 just shout about going fast. The Porsche keeps quiet and gets the job done. Love it.
How did the Porsche win the drag race?
Porsche..... Simply the best
Porsche..
Pretty sure this is the loudest and fastest drag race they’ve ever done
Yeah ferrraaaaarrrriiiiiii💓
Turbo S
I'd have the Ferrari🥰
Ciao, bella 😂😂 the best! 🇮🇹
This is a German car.
We need a 750+whp 992 Turbo R, more track oriented version of the S basically. Or a factory option for a significant power boost, keep it at the front
I LOVE the fact that how a humble V6 3.7 liter PORSCHE just annihilated two loud and angry 12 Cylinder icons... PORSCHE all day babe👍
LOOK it’s An ItlaiI GTo!!🎉😁
Porsche Yeahhhhhhhhh
Ferrari: The Extraordinary Gentlemen's Super Car with heaven like F1 sound. Lamborghini: Hell of a fighter Jet like good looking crazy fun car with nice doors & sound Porsche: The one trying to be invisible and fit into society but at the same time trying to dominate in all leagues...
Lamborghini adventedor svj Fam
OOOOH BOY Porsche with 150 less HP and half the price almost won everything
Ferrari
German engineering...it is fabulous, looks the best also
I will definitely vote for the Porsche 911 TurboS. Less price enuf power full throttle no sound my neighbors are a sleep and so are the cops and the city. Perfect car for underworld racing. How about Yianni and Mat exchange your cars in the next drag. It does not only matter who has the biggest engine !! Who's behind the wheels ...
812 sounds best
Anyone that says that Porsche 911 Turbo S isn't a super car is mad.
Well than get the demon with the drag package is going to beat that slow Ferrari
Porsche is destroying ferraris and lambos and nobody is even surprised
the lambo
911
Lambo sounds the best
Lambo
how is this possible ? lambo and ferrari has more hp, more torque and more cylinders.
Hhhhhhh, I really liked the Porsche wined.
YOU SHOULD RENAME YOUR CHANNEL   TO :  DRAGWOW 🤩
so the gt2 will be a 9 second car?
That black Ferrari is sure quicker than SF1000
I’ll take a 720s please. It will thrash them all!
@5:23 not a Yanni hater but did he jump the start ever so slightly?
Sound Ferrari. Everything else Porsche <3
Lamborghini svj
812 forever until the 812 tdf or 812 gto comes out
Porsche any day
Porsche. All day every day. Both regarding this question and the fact that you could actually use it like that.
The 992 is such an overachiever, doesn't need to be loud to over styled.
i'll take the ferrari
I would take the Ferrari it’s sound it’s looks are just too good
Mr. Matt.... Best & Funny CarWow video into. Mr. Yan, as always...start before the flag go down, smiles! Kind Regards to both and to the Porsche winner, from Portugal!
Best naturally aspirated exhaust sound I ever heard. All day every day LAMBO. I m from India and huge huge fan of you both Mat n Yanni.
Ferrari is the nicest looking car
Porsche for sure more efficient and cheaper
Lambo or Porsche
So the Porsche is hundreds of thousands of pounds cheaper than other 2 but beats them in every way lol
Lamborghini aventador SVJ
I love that Porsche. No need to make big noise. So fast !
why would anyone pay 200k to loose everything. obvious choice, Porsche❤️
Chuck Norris engineered the Turbo S
What the porsche do with that quality prize ratio is quite impressive. If I only could have one those, Porsche would be the car, with a proper exhaust system, of course!
I am not a fan Lamborghini I like Ferrari  but I would buy Porsche
Ferrari
Porsche obviously
Lamborghini
Every single time the 911 Turbo S comes to the best drag strip on YouTube(the CarWow dragstrip), I always hope it wins. And yet I'm sad/angry it won today... Only a Ferrari can make you switch sides like that lol. Big ups to everyone involved though, best drag race yet!👌👌👌
Ferrari 812 superfast any day
Porsche all day long
LAMBORGHINI!! VRRRRRRM POP VRRRM!!!!!
I would take the 812 fr
With the Ferrari being a comfortable grand tourer, it is incredibly competitive against cars like those!
812 GTS Ofc
Turbo S just destroying souls
Literatlly best sounding car is porche by a mile and Best looking car i have to give to ferrari even do the lambo is amaizing its still Mats chanel😁
Matt be rocking dat Burberrry mate <3
Porsche all day long 😀
Lambo anytime
Despite the Porsche being the fastest over 1/4 mile i'd take the Ferrari. After 120mph it just annihilates them and huge speed is all i'm all about. I bet with this huuuuge aero the Aventador wouldn't be able to get to it's top speed. Also the Lambo didn't sound better; it was just louder. The Ferrari had the more refined sound.
911 TURBO
I hate those Porsches, they couldn't be more German. No feelings but big results 🙁  The Ferrari turned from SuperFast to SuperSlow, what a shame. Enzo wouldn't approve such a heavy car 🤬  The Lambo I guess is the best of the three in real tracks, with corners. It is not supposed to be a drag car, but it did pretty well.😌
rip chadwick boseman
I would rather farrari bc it’s sounds better then the svj  and the other car I don’t know what your saying
lol I see all these comments about how Porsche is sooo much faster and I do agree in speed it is easily the fastest. and yet in real life, nearly all people will take the Lambo says it all. The truth is in real life you won't be able to tell which car is faster.  so you might as well just take the best looking one.
That Porsche is stock
Hats off for the porsche
Why did YouTube get rid of the poll feature, it was so good
That porche may sound like a fart but OMFG does it hustle along, how do they do it
SVJ 🐃
I Would took the lambo but it cost twice as much
Love the porsche, but also love that V12 sound of the Ferrari
Single clutch transmission on that lambo makes it more interesting and also holds it down at the same time
best part 4:56 tillmat watching yanni
That 911 turbo is just a different beast. Who the hell would buy a ferrari with all the options you can get now.
Ferrari
the German Porsche destroys the Italians with only 650 HP, damn what a shame for the Italian Cars.
Lambo = looks good Porsche = goes good
Money no object I’ll take the SVJ sell it and get the turbo s and a Pre-Owned 812! Lol
ferrari
make that italian accent everytime
Porsche !
Is this one of the best drag race on carwow???  Maybe or maybe not...  But this is the best drag race till now according to me.😌😌✌✌
porsche is a bitcccchhhhh.....holy that thing is quiccccckkk and cheap, it should be expensive
Best looker turbo s🐐
I don't understand why you don't do all your races in race/track/sport mode. You should be using the cars to their full potential when competing.
Disappointing no camera in the Porsche.
Svj
There is no better car than a porsche 911 turbo s! 🥵
포르쉐 : ㅈ밥새끼들..ㅋㅋ
Now this is perfect example of that old quote: "The dog who roars, ain't gonna bite you,but you'll  never know with those who are silent!"
Aventador svj
Awesome cars. But I'd take the Ferrari every day of the week. It's also surprisingly super fast in a straight line.
Porsch v6 kills a Lamborghini v12. Smart Engineering vs raw specs.
Svj sounds best
Germany all the way 😎💪👑👑
Porsche was like you lads with big engines fight it out and i will see the winner at the finish line
Porche all day everyday
Porsche, all day, everyday
🤏 porsche Dyson  🤏 lamborghini  RS skoda  👌 ferrari superfast the best v12 in the world
Two overblown, overstyled, over expensive trinkets, shown the way home by a (relatively) discreet everyday usable Porsche.
The Ferrari is rear wheel drive and ofc itll have a worse start. But having cought up to the lambo, thats just embarasing for the lambo. Especially as thats their flasgship car and it costs a whole 100k more than that of a ferrari grand tourer! BTW im not a ferrari fan boy :)
Seems like Porsche has a "Blitzkrieg mode" In that turbo S
Lambo just looks like some 5 yr olds poster car, Ferrari much nicer
That Ferrari though looks magnificent
Porsche it is for me!
Porsche does it again. Their horses have always been beyond reproach. I remember my old 996 GT3 handing around 70 TVR's their backside over 3/4 mile in 2007 with it's measly 381bhp and to this day they defy their statistics.
This was one of the best drag races... I’m still mad you haven’t included the 720s
He start early and i think Ferrari
I love Porsche
Honestly I actually wanna see what the BMW M8 does up against a 2012 Lamborghini Aventador 🤔
Can't beat a Porsche
Yainimiz
I won’t be doing 1/4 mile drag racing all the time so of course I’ll choose the Lamborghini for it’s high performance and better look
Porsche performance is so consistent in every perspective. Not just their petrol cars as well as EVs. Very impressive.
Porsche the best car.......
Ferrari, best sounding, and best looking car of them all
The German kills , don’t make fun of a German car  🙌🏼 ; lambo’s bulls does nothing
I love the Porsche ❤️
Ferrari 👀🤢Lamborghini 👀🥶 Porsche 😎😎😎😎😎😎
Che bello sentirti parlare in italiano
...and then the Turbos struck.🏎👀
I wanna have that Porsche.  Its literally the best car and you can drive it every day.  The most beautiful is the Ferrari, Porsche close 2nd. The Lambo looks like an edgy teenager designed it. Then again, most of em do.
Its nuts how the Porsche runs like it makes 750hp when it has 100hp less
Ferrari, tt contrasting yellow 👌
This Ferrari is damn sick ❤️
Hahaha porsche wins, although lambo starts before :D
I thought Yanni was shifting gears with the forward motion of his head but I forgot that Lambo trans is brutal
We need a shot of the aventador sliding at the start!! 😈😈😈😈
Porsche
Zeeee Germans are laughing 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Porsche all the way... 🇩🇪 💪
Porsche: Am I STILL a joke to you? Ferrari: I said Superfast, not Superquick. Lamborghini: I never said I'd win anything, but I sure do look nice. More show than go.
Ferrari FTW
This line up is so good I need to wank off
i am gonna love that Porsche, even its 6 cylinder technology is better than v-12
Lamborghini svj ❤💯
911 Turbo Bae 😂❤️
Lambo Best easy
jump start
While the 911 destroyed both Ferrari and Lamborghini, I'd still take the SVJ, simply for the fact that it's the ultimate version of my favorite Audi era Lambo. I love how it sounds, I love how it looks; it may not be as good of a daily as the 911, but damn sure it looks better than both it and the Ferrari.
That thumbnail tho🔥💯
Porsche 911 Turbo S... the S stands for Spanking everything else on the track... I'm going to save myself 200k....   Ring ring... 'Hello is that the Porsche Sales Team...?'
Porsche 922 911 Tubo S and get it wrapped in Yannie's favourite chrome colour
Oooh, Yahnni. Always the viseo more fun with Yahnni.
buy One Lambo....better buy 2 Porsche :-) and many Fuel
ferrari looks the ugliest among the three
Porsche
I rather have the Porsche.
Guess which is the best car? The one the Germans engineered... without any interference from any Italians! 😜
this is unfair , wait for hardcore version of 812 superfast then you will see the real horse
The Porsche
"There's this grey thing in the distance...."
The traction control and launch system on the Porsches are by far better than anything else...
I mean, would anyone really take a Turbo S over a 812 or SVJ if given the opportunity to have just one?
Ferrari 812 super fast
Porsche 911 because it's literally the most driveable out of the cars
Porsche 911 turbo s vs Dodge demon plz
Porsche,there is no substitute.👌🏽 Ferrari wins the looks dept tho I believe.
yianni jump start
Ferrari
of all 3, the only one i wouldn't have would be the Lambo.
100% Lamborghini
I'd get the lambo, sell it, buy a 911, and keep the rest.
Porsche 🙅🏼‍♂️👋🏼
Porsche
Ferrari
Am I the only person who wants to see a 1.  Lamborghini Aventador vs 2. Lamborghini Aventador S vs 3. Lamborghini Aventador SV vs 4. Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Porsche 911 turbo s never lose
Both the Porsche and the lambo are AWD compared to the RWD Ferrari............
Porsche ofcourse
It looks like matt jumped the start on the second drag race
Ferrari all the way
Volkswagen saved the day.
Ferrari😎
How someone could destroy the ferrari by ordering it all black... A w f u l
Haven't even seen the video yet but I know Porsche has won.
Porsche every day
Finally......the glorified bug wins......bout time. lol
Porsche always surprises me
Yanni is there for one reason and one reason only! To beat Matt and no one else ! Hahaha
This video start at 5:25
Yanni jump started as usual 😂
Ferrari everyday
I wish Ferrari, because it’s only car that is pure sport and stunning design matching all perfectly together since there was no Porsche and Lamborghini before even
Am I the only one that thought the 812 won lol
Ferrari has the best sound🔥🔥🔥🔥
Not bad for a beetle!
HAHAHHAA BELLISSIMA LA INTRO
The Porsche looks very plain in comparison
All day 812 ❤️
Definitely Porsche
The single-clutch is slowing down SVJ
Don't even need to watch, Porsche kill it
from the looks i really like the ferrari but the porsche is just the best car, no discussion
aventador ... sorry mat
lamborghini adventador svj is the nicest
If the Porsche sounded great it would be perfect
Ferrari : Grumm grummmmm am the king Lamborghini: Wroooommmmm wroooommmmm am the boss Porsche : 🐦🐦🐦 hold my stick
Two fancy looking cars against a extremely well engineered car, Respect
If anything this shows how fast the Tesla model S is ... Especially being a family car
The porsche is like that quite boy in the class who even the bullies definitely dont want to miss with
I'd have the Porsche 911 Turbo S everytime.
Porsche all day long ❤🙏
Got to hand it to the engineers from Stuttgart. No BS. Pure performance.
Lambo
The Pakistani always cheats at the start 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I would go for a Porsche it's a sports cars and a daily driver
Ferrari 812 sf
dogs that bark do not bite   German proverb
🔥💪🏼Porsche Сила💪🏼 🔥
Lambo have the best sound ❤️👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🎊
I'd pick the 812... Porsche is better in almost every conceivable way but when you open the garage door in the morning and see that utterly gorgeous 812 sitting there, fire up the V12 and look out over the silly long bonnet, you know you made the right choice. Bet that'd make any Monday another best day ever.
FERRARI SF90 STRADALE..... Who would like to see on a drag race?
I think the 911 Carrera 4s is all the sports car you really need.
Its PorschE, not Porsch
Ferrari sounds better
i'd sacrifice my left nut to have that porsche. what a monster.
The porsche is an acceleration beast
I love Porsche ! Was a fool to undersetimate it 😍
Ferrari 812 superfart sounden The best😍😍
The one who counts down sholdn't do it always the same as you know the timing and would jump the start if she waits a second longer.
It's been a long time since i laughed so hard!
the most awaited race ever....
Porsche
ill take the porsche, thank you
Looks like Nintendo's Mario announcing cars
Lambo! Then I sell and buy a Red and a Black Porsche 911 Turbo S
The 812 is perfect
I would have the Porsche more than the Lambo and Ferrari
Yanniiiiiiiiiiii
Thumbs up for Ferrari Lovers best look and Sound !👍👍👍
I think mclaren 720s will beat them in rolling race
Yianni's sole passion in life is to hand matt his ass😂
The crazy engagement of Yanni is what all these drag races are all about
Viva germany
Can't be the only one who thinks Yanni is obnoxious. Good race thought.
I like porscha
SVJ
Porsche
Italians: our car has more horsepower Germans: that's nice Italians: our car has more torque Germans: Alles gute Italians: our car looks better  Germans: so we racing ? Ja or nah??
ferrari for sure. more luggage space..
where is dbs supperlegera
As a German I would pick the Porsche, even if it was the slowest one. But well, Lamborghini is technically also a German brand.
Porsche all day..
Porschaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I have lamborghini SVJ and Porsche
Value for money the Porsche is the better car... And also faster in the real world of Street Racing.
Why do you race with a turbo equipped car along with a naturally aspirated engine, there is a no match...
The Porsche is a beast 150 Hp less
Porsche >> Ferrari >> Lambo
Porsche all day
Porsche: Dominates Blokes: Disrespect it by not pronouncing Porsche correctly  😉
Lambo is dream😍
Ferrari best looking
Matt couldn't launch the Superfast🤷🏿‍♂️
I’m love Lamborghini but I respect Porsche way more after this video
Porsche
Dynamites comes in small packages they the PORSCHE 911 TURBO S!!
Only Lamborghini 😍😍😍😍
Me at 100mph: let's slow this shit down.  Mat Watson at 190mph: Go away tire pressure warning.
Rip chadwick Boseman
Porsche 911 turbo S
I'd buy the Ferrari, sell it new then buy a Porsche and a nice house
Super fast is the best looking
Mhhmmm Maybe the RR Phantom And the Bentley Flying Spur?
The Porsche sounds like a hair dryer
Ferrari sound better to my ear
Who else knew Yianni was in the lambo lol
WAKANDA FOREVER
Why not film third pearson ??
Maaan that Porsche 😮.
100% porsche for sure!
I choose the porche the fastest yanimize hhhhhhh
I would 💯 % go with the Porsche!
I would have the Porsche. 😁😎
I’d have that Porsche Turbo S over the Lambo or Ferrari any day.
812 superfast for me
lambo sounds like a crazy motorcycle
I'd have the porsche, but really I want one from the 70s
Well, speeding is illegal, yet they're all fast, so I'd have the Ferrari, followed by the Porsche, then the Lambo.
The Turbo S by a long shot.. cheapest and best performance
Porsche all the way. 😌👍🏼
Porsche is the Best! German Cars are the BEST!!
Porsche is underrated
Lamborghini
Humble porshe ..i love that
Ferrari sound better
I will take the superfast all day long... sounds the best and really fast when its rolling... even more fun due to rwd only.. lets ad some fear.
I cant express how much i love this channel + yianni, would love to see the Porsche 918 spyder in a future vid soon:)
Old Gal on wheels here - has to be the Porsche, more of a lady's styling with a winning "beat them bitches" attitude!
Can‘t beat the Porsche sorry
Porsche Sound is rediciolous. The Porsche sound of older Porsche is much better.
Porsche looks the best handles the best and the most handsome 💯🤞🏾
This was one of the best Carwow drag races and the funniest 😂😂😂 PETITION FOR A DRAG RACE BETWEEN 2020 RS5 vs 2020 S6 !! Both have 444HP same drivetrain, S6 is more equipped for 2K more
Porsche quietly handing out ass whoopings... as always.
Porsche ❤️
They both false started on the second rolling race :)
Take the most expensive sell it and then by the Porsche 😂
See that Tubor S , no more guessing
sees 911 turbo s in the title. Ahh shit here we go again
just buy a goddamn Porche, end of story. No if's no buts.
They should use the Porsche as a film car with the camera facing backwards.
Matt outhear sounding like Gino Decampo🤣🤣🤣🤣
We can see in the Rolling Races why the Ferrari is called the Superfast and not the Superquick
Porsche is the best
812 win sound test
Tumbnail might be v6 destroys v12
that porsche is an animal . and the ferrari sounds better than the lambo
Porsche king
Mat does love a bit of Burberry.
Lambo for days
lambo is sick
Porsche for sure
Porsche 911 Turbo S for me...all day. What a car 😎♥️
Porsche!!
A barking dog never bites.
ferrari
i love how the race was about the Ferrari and the Lambo and no one cared about the car that won most of the races
my dream car again 🙌😎 Turbo S 👊
This is the perfect example of why price ≠ performance
Porsche sounds best
If you have the same rage as Yianni driving the lambo, then you can accomplish everything in your life
I would have the Porsche
If u ever think that carwow is staged af, u may be right :)) 7:16
Aventador looks better
German vs italy vs british I am still waiting for this. Porsche vs Lamborghini vs mclaren
Anyone see Yianni jump the 3rd gear rolling race?
Carwow is spreading awareness about just how fast a 911 turbo is .
Porsche goes while Lambo and Ferrari just trigger the hoes
I will always live by my favorite motto "less is more"
That porsche with that half a price, mauled the bull and the horse. Stuttgart power baby!
I'd take the Porsche
I love your revving ritual. Puts a smile on my face every time.
911 all day every day
That new 911 turbo s is something else.
Good race. Nice to have seen the m8 in the mix as well
Porsche all day every day just keep whipping them flashy bois cars 🤪🥳
Did Yianni jump the first start? I think so. 🙄🤔
Svj
Aventador SVJ sounds better
That Porsche though..
Whos laughing at porsche now😂
Def the ferrari
lambo all day but that porsche is wicked!!
I'll take the 812, still insanely beautiful and kinda confortable 👌🇮🇹
Still obsessed with the 812
The Porsche 911 Turbo S is the best car out there. I love that car to bits. It has thrashed every competition thrown at it.
I'm sorry but I would always choose a Porsche over a Ferrari or a lambo, hell Ferrari and Lamborghini would probably be the last cars I would choose to buy if I had all the money in the world
Porsche 911 Turbo S still a go for me
I’d have the Ferrari!
Porsche cheaper and better than three 😂
Cool yannis back in uk except matt recorded it before yanni came to Cyprus and roasted matt again
I love the Ferrari is the best
I swear Yanni jumps the start on every race 🤔
LAMBOOOOO
who cares,ferrari is so sexy
i really want a 812 superfast novetic modification
5 min into the video and you are still just talking, bloody hell start already
I would have the 911 every time. The drag race king
Finally a good drag race!
I think that Porsche Turbo S can only be beaten by a Porsche GT2 RS.  The Turbo S  could defeat the likes of Koenigsegg or Bugatti as well.
Yanni: "Let's talk about the bull beating the horse, mate".  Actually...
At first the lambo was like bye bye mat 😎
Porsche and mclaren are the same. Horse power doesn't matter. What a practical German machine it is.
5:20
Ferrari all day every day🐎🖤 btw just imagine rwd and almost won the drag race😎
I’ve gotta have the Porsche
Yanni is cheating again 🙄
Money no object! Ferrari all day long ... having said that though, we all know the Porsche is the nost reliable, easy to live with, cheaper to run ...
Always the king porsche
That Porsche did it well for 650 HP but the sound is Horrible
812 any day of the week.
That Porsche is a monster, I'd take it any day. Easier to live with every day, great daily driver, amazing track weapon. And, IMO, it looks better than the overdesigned Italians.
I love the Ferrari , Looks , Performance , <3
Ferrari
only the Porsche, thank you.
The design of that 812 is mental
Porsche all the way
Yanni loves sand bagging making the race unfair
0:18 was my Moment :D
PLEASE, you don't say "poooschh" you say "POR-SCHE"!!!! regards // the Angry German
Porscha 911Turbo
Straight back to Cardiff :D
Um @carwow I want to prove something to my friend please race the Aventodor SVJ vs the Dodge Demon 🔪
I'm still waiting for Porsche GT2RS
THE STIG was driving the Porsche.
Drag races without yanny just ain’t the same.
I ferrari v12 sound, that’s my opinion! Ps love these videos
El carro de mi vida el Porsche 911 y si algún día llegar a tener dinero me compraría el del 1996 y me compraría otro 2020
Lamborghini of yani sounds great it is the best car eveer
I’d have to say the 812 is the car I’d have and it honestly sounds better imo😘
no question, the Porsche ;)
Ferrari sounds bessssstttt
911 Turbo S by far!!!!
Porsche 911
Porsche because it’s one of the best launch controls in the market, and would be a great blend of comfort and racing
Well the race was between yani and Matt. It was not about cars
Porsche
porsche4life
Mclaren 720s vs svj vs fararie a12 superfast plzzz
Ferrari is the best looking car
These 2 are idiot together... And I love it 😂😂
He has the best drag races on YouTube
I would choose the Porsche. Best design language. Amazing car! The others are playing, the Porsche is winning.
I would have the porsche.
I’d have to have the svj
00:00 hahahahahahah
I wonder how the Shelby GT500 would fair against these guys? As it has around the same horsepower but would be the most affordable by far.
Porsche is best for daily driving , Lamborghini best sound
Porsche. The others are insanely expensive to upkeep
SVJ 🥰
turbo S all the way🙂
Porsche is Porsche!
The gear changes in the Lambo are too spaced out and jerky. It would have smoked both cars.
Do a dodge deamon vs Porsche 911 s turbo. It will be epiccccccccc.
Great race...top cars! Like to see you guys together.
The Porsche every day, because a turbo engine is just some boost pressure away from even more power.
Porsche:"I don't need power. I don't need sound. Just need to be Porsche "
Yanni is hilarious. Oh, and i would take the 812!
Those gear changes in the lambo are brutal
Clearly the Porsche 🤪🤯😝
Hooligan😂
Imagine that the future is only going to be electric no brutal sounds anymore :c
German machine
Dude, that freaking Porsche is the Kratos of supercars, absolute god-slayer!
That Turbo S is potty.
Lamborghini always...
Depends on the driver remember
Aventador sounds best
why no more poll?
The Porsche makes the other two look like a joke.
am sad right now, i used to love the SVJ so much until today, please repeat this drag race race and replace the svj with hurancan performante
F12 gang
I'd have a Porsche
Ferrari or Porsche not a fan of Lamborghinis designs.
I would have the porsche 100%
McLaren 765lt?
Porsche for me ...no hesitation at all,no question ! Frankly, if you get only one sports car in your lifetime it's  automaticaly ,necessarily a Porsche ! The 911 is an icône,not only an automotive icône but a pure icône, a uniquely distinctive object and...it's a fucking beast 😁
Goddammit Yianny Always the same expression and shouting - "Come on" every drag race start 😂😂
loud obnoxious cars schooled by refined engineer perfection -Porsche is on another level
Less power WIN typical Porsche
Rarri for me ❤️🖤
I will go with Bugatti Chiron 😂
Do a drag with a Bugatti
Porsche all day
Do a new ford gt vs 911s turbo
812.
His German accent 😂
Your girlfriend just asked: Why are you watching 2 VWs drag racing a Fiat! 🤣
Yianni jumped the start 100% - and still lost to the Porsche
Porsche 💛
Well if money isn't a problem then Lamborghini a thousand times
to all those talkin here,  yeah the 2020 porsche is a craaazy good dream car but the other two are wild naturaly aspirated monsters, one of them has a f*cking medieval single clutch the other one is rear drive only and both of them (i only had the chance to drive the Ave S but i think the 812 is great in that aspect too) have a loooooot more fun to them in every aspect then every porsche outside the GT series will ever have... so yeah, the turbo s is just a car where porsche put everything they have (outside of electric) in... maybe one day lamborghini and ferrari will do something similar (maybe Ferrari has?! idk)... all wheel drive, all wheel steering, turbos, double clutch, weight saving etc...
The Lamborghini SVJ and then sell it so I can buy a Ferrari
...anybody would take the Porsch E! if you got the difference in cash back and no wonder Fettel cant win anymore...
I mean we all know horsepower is not the main thing when it comes to drag races right?
Porsche simply eats them
Svj
Yanni, first learn how not to jump start. Than learn how to pronounce Porsche correctly. Than talk trash.
Please have a Race: AMG GT Black Series vs. Porsche 911 Turbo S
Lamborghini all day long. Supercars should be about drama. The Porsche is boring as fuck. The Ferrari is awesome but Lambo wins my heart
Lamborghini: I will definitely win this drag race"   Porsche: *we'll see about that*
Ferrari won the soundtrack competition though!
The Porsche is the like the quiet kid in class
Porsche for speed and SVJ for looks
I am quite comfortable with the size of my manhood. I am therefore not a potential Lamborghini customer :D   911 Turbo S all the way.
Sorry but Lamborghini adventador svj
why is ferraris speedo jumping speeds it's not even close to beeing smooth
*A grandpa in casual clothes who doesn’t bother watching his snobby little grandsons play through his rearview mirror.*
Panda 🐼
I know it's just for fun, but I do wonder why every car gets locked into 3rd gear when they all have different power curves. Why not just put them in sport and let the computers figure it out?
Ferrari always ♥
Porsche every day!
.
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
At 7:16 yanni says"come on..................oooooo" I died haha:)
Wow ferrari really do build there road cars with the same technology as their f1 cars.... Dead last
The one least talked about in the class, took THE girl.👊🏻       And then, every one started talking about it.
I would have all cars but spec it definitely, the Porsche would be a daily driver n the Lambo n the Ferrari would jus be cars to take out on da weekend
Best drag races on the internet, period.
812 2wheel drive
Ferarri
The Lamborghini sound better
the porsche is a cheaper and better car but we all want the svj or the ferrari
Volkswagen needs to buy Ferrari 😬
I would have the Turbo S, but I would definitely change that exhaust and straight pipe
That Porsche is what I want
Porsche is the better car all round
This was really good fun, what a laugh. Thanks guys 👍
Oh my god
These challenges are completely useless. The real car strenght is determinated by the lap in the track. The turbo S has a twin turbo engine and because of this has more tourque, in facts it can go 0-60 mph in less time than lambo and Ferrari that have a natural aspirated V12. The fastest car in the drag races is the Dodge Demon, but not for this is the best car in the world. A Lot of Nürburgring laps are FAKE. Volkswagen group cheat on these things. Do you noticed that no Ferrari has ever driven at the green hell? That’s for a reason, Ferrari doesn’t care about these bullshit. Porsche 911 GT2 RS has the fastest lap in the Ring, true, but it wasn’t a regular gt2, in facts it is called GT2 RS MR, go to check if you don’t believe me. Ferrari has more F1 titles than everyone, this year won 24 hour le mans. Alfa romeo Giulia and Stelvio DESTROYED Mercedes, Audi and bmw cars. Pagani is the most Exclusive car brand in the world, the Zonda R is the fastest and loudest track car in the world. I could talk about Abarth, Maserati and other italian masterpiece but i have no time. Sorry guys, italians do it better.❤️🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
Yanagini car is better looking.
VOTE: Ferrari 812 Super fast.
FACT:- When Yanni himself sits in a Lambo, the actual power of the car increases by 69.99%
Man the porsche had half the cylinders and it just dominated the lambo and ferrari Man, that porsche is my dream car now
SVJ by a mile
SVJ all the way
it'd be good if there was a drone shoot over the cars
812 best sound
I like the Porsche 🖤🖤
Надо было сравнивать вместо 812 суперфаст 488 писта она более быстрая
Porsche
I'll get the SVJ then sell it to buy the Turbo S and keep the remaining £200k 😁😏😎
The Porsche, any time, any day!
Ma che è sta intro italiana ahahahahah ti adoro :)
I knew the Porsche will win that. Have less power and heavier than the Lambo, and still beat it. The Lambo just too loud,  and if the Ferrari have the traction then kill the bull easily. Ferrari all day 🙂 but imagine if the Porsche have similar hp...
Porsche
They are all great. Truly dream cars, I couldn't choose even if I had that money. I don't care who win.
Imagine what porsche can do with a 6.5L v12 😏
Porsche could easily make a car competing with Koenigsegg and Bugatti, if they would want to
812 Is the best looking supercar ever
Lesson: Performance speaks louder than exhausts.
The Lamborghini its go to be😷
Yianni in his mind be like “ this lambo is soo slow”
it doesn't matter those millisecond numbers. Lambo always will be the raging bull
"Killed the Ferrari tho"
Definitely the Ferrari, I think it looks more classy, the Lambo just feels like it’s made for a 22 year old and I don’t like that
strait 6 kicks v12 s what an engineering
812 is my absolute Dreamcar. It's beautiful and classy, the sound is a symphony and the performance is still on a very high level if you consider it's RWD and the heaviest car in here. Love it.
Porsche be like - only empty vessels make noise.!
Svjjjjjj !!!
911 like a boss 👑👌🏻
jj
I want the SVJ
You looks like Cristiano Ronald matt😂
Ferrari Ferrari is the best
Ferrari: i got 800 hp and sounds like a f1 car Lamborghini: im the most expensive car here A quiet porsche: boys take my dust
Porsche everyday
Porche's feeling a bit left out over there 😂. Thats a cheetah next to a bull and a horse
Have not even watched this yet but have to say what a sensational line up for a drag race.  Keep up the good work guys 🙂
I´d have the Porsche bc I could drive it as a daily and on the track and it wouldn´t break down as often as the Ferrari and the Lambo.
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Porsche all day any day
You fool bella
i wish i have porsche 911 turbo s  i don't know why but i like it
I hate this new Climate shit in germany .... there will be no New M2 sold in germany..
Porsche 992 turbo s
If Money were no object 1. Would be Ferrari  2. Very close 2nd Porsche  3. Lambo
😂😂😂 those accents are accurate Mat
Do the gt2rs
Svj best nurghbourkring lap
Porsche 911 Turbo S for me. I'm all for that SPEEEED!!!
Do you know that extreme satisfaction, when you root for something to win, and then it does? Porsche4Life!
Lamborghini is the  best ☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻
The SVJ is lighter than the Turbo S?!?! Wha?!
GT4 vs Carrera vs A45s?
Porsche, no second thought
2:05 a dual clutch can't be fitted to an aventador bcs it's too big
Don't underestimate the power of the Porsche...😘😘
Imagine an Aventador with a dual clutch 🙆🏽‍♂️ notice how it jerks back when switching gears with that ISR
When the Porsche 992 Gt2 Rs will come out? He will distroy everything
Porsche always wins 🏆🥇🔥
Lamborghini SVJ💪💪
If the Aventadors came with DCT’s they would be so much faster in the drag and roll races with the much quicker shifts
Svj
I love porsche🤩🤩🤩🤩
Do you know what that Porsche is...? Paint it red and you'll notice IT'S THE 400KPH-GOING *"ROAD FIGHTER"* ARCADE GAME CAR COMES TO LIFE! You know, the one where Superman flying through when you're going top speed...? Can't believe the engineers built it out of a 30 year old + game
Porsche 💪👌
Definetely the Porsche but new exhaust system!
Money no object I'll take the Ferrari 812 Superfast but that Porsche though!
Porsche 👑
Yianni: "If it's a Lamborghini, it can only be one person."    Should we tell him?
I ll have Ferrari or porsche.
Lambo would destroy them on a track:))
Porsche, all day
porsche 911 turbo s definetly 😍😍😍
It's a pleasure to see the lambo guy with mat !!❤️❤️
Porsche any day !!!!
1525kg for the SVJ?  More like 1770kg.  That’s what some publications measured it at.  1525kg is dry weight, no fluids, no battery even.
Even with Matt cheating at 7:03, not having it
That lambo might sound better, but the 911 turbo S is insane! Also, that Ferrari... how much wine did those designers have when they designed it??
Your channel will always be way more enjoyable than the new top gear shows
That Porsche is stupid fast.
That was the worst German imitation I've ever heard
I would definitely go for the Porsche!
Ferrari and Lambo  Respect boys
Ferrari super fast but Ferrari is always are fast
Do people think this kind of entertainment is funny? This whole pretend goof bull cr4p.
PORSCHE
Porsche is Best!
Drag caused by svj downforce from wings and splitters
definitely the  Porsche.
06:07 Actually,the Porsche sign has a horse on it too,so Yianni, 1-0 for the horse
Mat Best car
But which one stands with the Nürburgring #1 Label?😝
SVJ 4 a world 🌍
Porsche
Lambo got that Early Start tho
911 such a beautiful Car... Ferrari an lambo is nothing
anyone else notice the lambo and  porsche took off before her arms went down on the first run and ferrari took of first on the second??
I got happy when I saw Yanny!
Lambo and Ferrari: *unleash the roars of Mount Olympus*  911: *quietly* "I'll show you real pops and bangs" *grabs gun*
You just got a dislike for that accent.
I’m really surprised by the SVJ, considering the gearbox it has, it did really well! A lot better than the SV. I can only imagine how good it’s replacement will be when it finally gets a double clutch gearbox
Lamborghini always
That ferrari top end speed is amazing, cant tell that about the "other" ferrari 🙄
Idk
PORSCHE 911 TURBO
They don’t even care about the Porsche they care about winning themselves
Would have the Porsche
Ferrari
The Ferrari is the only rear wheel drive car here, but it still kills it. I'd say it did a pretty good job.
Friend of mine got the 812...and its a blessing drivin it!!!!🤗
Porsche a masterpiece of engineering
911
Porche
911 is insane
Lambo all day every day!
I go for Porsche
Bella Italia against German engineering!😅
9:27 matt not when you’re driving we’ve talked about this
812 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Money no object i would take the Porsche any day🙌🔥
hahahahaha loved the voice acting! skkrt skkkrt
I can't understand why i always underestimate Porsche
Not watched, but i guess the porsche is going to take this one.
0:01 cringe
Yanagini sounds the best 😎
5:15ランボルギーニ派　5:17フェラーリ派
Porche for sure
Yanni has two personalities😂
Germany🔥
2.2 Bar? Sounds very low?
Porsche seems to be a little conservative about their bhp figures. No way is that 650.
Porsche definitely
Mat says that svj won not Yanii so another win for Mat ...😌😌😉😍
I would choose the 911, it’s simply the best car
The Lamborghini an the Ferrari sounded great! But I would choose the Porsche because it's so fast and it's not a RUHESTÖRUNG
Shame on lambo, the victory was more like a defeat GT car!!
Porsche: *Smiles in engineering*
aight so i need about $150,000 more to afford the 911 :)
Its a shame that superfast wasn't red. Such a beautiful car
Less money = more power
Porsche just showed the middle finger to the flashy Italians😅😅
We need more mat and yianni videos!! 😂👏
Best intro ever...
I would have the Ferrari
PORSCHE 911!!! PORSCHE 911!!! PORSCHE 911!!!
best sounding drag race to date
Porsche
Lamborghini all day
I would rather have a huracan performante than the aventador svj. The performante shifts better with its dual clutch transmission
PORSCHE BY FAR
FERRARI 812 Super fast in BLACK. So gangster!  PORSCHE Turbo S  Lame bo
Ferrari 812 all day
Definitely Porsche
If Porsche were to make v12’s, I wonder what their performance would be...but tbh, I kno they’ve probably looked into the weight, size, efficiency of other engine modifications and have come away that the flat 6 is just good enough
Love that Porsche!!!
xddd
For gods sake get rid of Yianni. What a knobhead
SVJ
First 20 sec were amazing hahah
Porsche all day everyday.....
LAMBORGHINI VS FERRARI VS PORCHE VS BUGATTI CHIRON?👀🙏🔥
Damn! Porsche - half the price, half the cylinders. Smokes them. 911 Turbo S is the King of Drag Races. Probably better on the track and of course a daily driver.  I choose the Porsche
I thought you were a German fellow as you were doing the accent, Mat. Well done. Now let's move on.
just remember the lamborghini motor is more then 6 years old
1500 + Yianni = 1700
Порш - это что-то невероятное! 2,65 до сотки кажется..
Another win 😂 0.1 sec Give me a break  Chose different pilot pls the one who knows how to warm up the car properly
I love both v12 Italians, and the Turbo S. I'd have them all!
i’ll take the Porsche any day not only because it is the fastest but also because it is the most usable car on the streets.
911 T S
I prefer the look of the Ferrari
Blah blah blah Porsche blah. What's happening with carguys these days? Cmon, ITALIAN V12! N.A. V12!
lol rename channel cardrag
Matt speaks Like an italian then starts talking normally   Not gonna lie they had us in the first half
(Who is still waiting on Bugatti Chiron?) 👇
I would have an SVJ
Damn, that PORSCHE IS A BEAST!!
Porsche is like the parents playing with their children.
Yianni's teeth are whiter than that SVJ...guess he did a good wrapping job on them LOL
Ill have the Porsche please.
Great video, made all the more fun when Yianni and Matt go at it.
I would get the ferrari, drive it for a few days and sell it to get that porsche and some cash
Why can't they make sure they all take off at the same time?
All of them
To everyone say they rather have the 911 think about a few things. The lambo and the Ferrari are a dying breed that we will see less and less off while the 911 is showing us what the future of sports cars is:quiet and fast with no emotion
Of course Porsche 911 turbo s
I would choose the Porsche. Its cheaper and better and it costs lower when you do a car service
911 turbo s
I'd have 812
No ones gonna talk about how Yanni jumped the first race?
911 all day knew it before you raced
911 all day! everyday!
Ferrari Whole life!
I will take the svj.
Lambo alll day
Well that porsche made the lambo and ferrari look stupid!!
How non-car enthusiasts watch; Station Wagon vs Batmobile vs Blobfish
Carwow is the new Top Gear!
Porsche is crazy man 😭😭🔥🔥
911
I mean i would get the lambo all day everyday... if i could...so
I like the porsch most!
Porsche the best
Ferrari
I'd have the Ferrari
Pls do hyper cars race
The Ferrari in that black is just sweeet!
Pardon me, but if we’re talking bulls and horses, Porsche’s pony won that race against a bull and a younger other 🐎
Why does Yianni always lean forward when doing these races? looks well odd lol
I would have the porsche all day long !!
4:14 What Porsche 😉
lambooooo
I would have the Porsche because it's the most comfortable one, and best for daily driving...
911s
Ferrari sounds way better then lambo
PORSCHE !$ BOSS ❤️
992 Turbo S.
And the Turbo S at it again..
911 💔
Porsche
Laferrari vs P1 vs 918 please.. 😎😎
I would definitely definitely have the Porsche 911 half the cylinders whopping V12 arse's very hard.
It's always Yianni vs Matt. Third car seems irrelevant
That aventador svj needs a dual clutch gearbox
why the Porsche is not making any noise?
Ich nehme den Porsche
Mat: „Can we talk about the Porsche winning“  Yianni: „No lets talk about the bull beating the horse mate“  Porsche also being a horse...😶  (6:02)
Porsche.. Cause its somuch car for money
Wow. That Porsche moved out. Amazing!
Porsheeeee all try way just by the fact it can be a daily driver car as well and kick the Ferrari  812 on the track 👍🏾
Take the Porsche turbo S, go to Techart and the car will have a supercar look...
That porsche...
I‘d like having the 812gts but no moneymoneymoney
Lower tyre pressure= higher grip
Lambo sounds best
Driver weights should be weighed in as well :)
Ferrari is the best 🇮🇹❤️
PORSCHE...
Ferrari
Change super fast for 765lt 😪
Please DRAG RACE mclaren 765lt v Porsche 911 Turbo S
All day every day Porsche ok yannie and Matt .by hearted Porsche fan🤩😍
Turbo s all day long. Can use it as a daily and more reliable than the other 2.
Next drag Ferrari sf90 stradale vs Porsche 992 turbo s
Ferrari sound the best for me
Porsche 911 turbo s
Porsche
I do like the looks and practicality of the 911, it's just that the engine letting me down. If they still managed to keep the Naturaly Aspirated, it is indeed the best car.  It's already hard enough to choose between 812 and SVJ for their NA V12 engine, so a 911 still a no no because of it's engine.
Lamborghini
Ferrari FXXK EVO pls 😍
That Porsche though! Almost half the price and half the cylinders but it managed to keep up with the the super cars 🥺
Ferrari is so beautiful but Porsche... is kinda a quiet beast. I don't like Lambo it is like a show off car and nothing more.
That's a lot of shouting from cars in 2nd and 3rd place ;)
It should be à GT2 RS but great race
Would have Porsche all day. It even dropped the v12 in acceleration. Would be even worse if it would go around corners! German engineering.
Please make a way to show us the speed in kilometers “not everyone is from the uk AHAHAH”
4:55 i like to think that porsche is looking in the background and in german accent be like: look at theze clownz, o ya victory will be main
812 super fast not fast hhhhh
The Lambo was throwing flames, so it wins.   That Porsche though...
Goddamn the Porsche is just amazing 😱😱😱
It's lighter as it doesn't has dual clutches......
Porsche super fast 😳😳😳😳
German engineering at its absolute finest
Ferrari: Beautiful Lamborghini: Drama Porsche: Engineering
If McLaren in race then always McLean
I would take a regular SV over an SVJ however if that Ferrari had a better exhaust on it Ferrari for the win
They don’t put the demon in there because they’d hate a car below $90.000 would beat Ferrari’s and lambo’s
I just can't get my head around this Porsche... it defies physics. I don't think I've seen it lose yet.... I've never been a fan of porsche but this one may sway me
Porsche POWER!!!
Lambo
812 superfast
My favourite car is a 911 turbo, but if you take them on a track the Ferrari and Porsche won’t stand a chance. That SVJ is on another level. Only the GT2RS MR is faster
I really think the Ferrari sound bater
Nobody will play with the Porsche ... the 911 is and remains a 911 ... the sports car of all sports cars/Respekt ❤️❤️❤️👌👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
best job ever
Superfast All Day erday
Id definitely have the lambo if money didn't matter but for the value id just buy two porsches
You are talking Italian like a (GAY )🤣🤣🤣🤣 💪🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do you ever see comment and think  ”Wish i’d writtenen that”
812 superfast
They didn’t even care the Porsche was there lol
Best drag race ever
Lamboo svj
911 😍
Porsche looks sooo smooth but they didn't remember about Deustche Performance😎💪🇩🇪
I am above everything else, a german car (Mercedes, Porsche, Audi and BMW) fan, but there is something about that 812 that I can't help but love it
The Porsche is the cheapest and fastest💯🥇
Porsche. Lambo is horrific inside. Ferrari is just not nice.
Porche because its the cheapest and the fastest and safest
At the beginning mat introducing Porsche like  Half the no. Of cylinders ,cheap among the 3 and bla bla bal but at the end porche layed a tight slap and shut them up
Porsche
Turbo S all day
I would take the SVJ
Mat: which beast would u buy?  Boys out-SVJ Beast On a Date-F812 Race out-911 .  .  My Bank:🖕
The 911turbos is definetely the ultimate all time best.
The king looking is foors and aero dynamic is the SVJ WOW
I was very impressed with the 812. I thought it ran 10.7 in the 1/4 mile
Ferrari 812sounds better
The 812 superfast for sure
The svj
Ofc Lamborghini SVJ is the best looking Ferrari will never beat its looks also the Porsche is such a nice car even though it’s quiet there’s something about that brand that’s so special and makes it deifferent
You should try and get a challenger demon on here, it would be interesting to see real world results
Yianni: we all know what the Porsche is all about. Porsche: so what’s the most expensive car all about? Losing? Lol.
Bro wtf is this porsche🤯🤯
a little help on pronouncing porsche. think about saying porsches and leave the s.
That Porshe is insane
No brainer 812 Superfast allday
Give me the svj and i will sell it and buy me a porche and spend the cash
Porsche is way cooler and better. unlike the stupid kid like designing of svj. ferrari looks cool tho
Deutsh qualitad  hahahhahaa
I would take the porsche all day long. Matt: Just that gray spott in the distance. Porsche: Am i a joke to you?
I never knew the starter was this gorgeous 😍  until I had a closer look today 😍 💘
I would like to have the Ferrari
porche is the best
On track and in the City racing at traffic lights - The porsche is the ultimate queen but on the German Autobahn ferrari will leave all of them far behind.
So I guess there IS replacement for displacement? Some mad GERMAN engineering!
Most often, when we accelerate we are not stopped, the car run, and if we race : we put on the right gear. the last race in the video is the most relevant.
Always the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ (with a dual clutch transmission though 🥺)
6:05 the other horse still beat the bull 😂
Who agrees with me that yianni has the best reaction time during races and mat has the worst reaction time
The Ferrari
svj
Porsche 🔥❤
Ferrari
German Engineering 💪🏼
I'd have the Ferrari!
812
It wont be a Lambo without Yianni
That was one epic drag race
It’s funny how they ignore the Turbo S
I money was not a matter, I would go for the Ferrari, it just looks so gorgeous.
The 812 sounds better
812 sounded better than the SVJ
If you want to be something in life Be the Porsche 911 Turbo S.
Porsche turbs all day long dont like ferrari as a brand they think there something there not, lambos are defo the best looking but zee germans just no how to do it understated but  wlll smack your ass if you get to big for your boots 👢
I would get the 812
911 all day ....
Porsche
I would have the porsche
Ferrari and Lamborghini: Engine goes VRRRRRR Porsche: Silent....but deadly
Porsche or Lambo
That porsche is amazing
I'd take the Ferrari any day
Really impressed about the german engineering , how can a flat 6 beat a v12 !! Imagine that porsche by 12 cylinders !!!!
Bugatti and koenigsegg: hold ma beer
911
Italian car are the best! 🇮🇹🔥
Love Porsche💪, wins the race and it costs half the price of the Lambo.😂
No doubt, that Porsche is the best
Lamdo jumped the start
This Is Yianni  Takes someone else's SVJ Does Donuts with it  The owner :ffs I need new tires
Ferrari 812 superfast
just buy a Porsche or McLaren
Porsche all the way, it's small and packs a punch. In fact it makes the most of horsepower it has. . . . It's Bruce, Bruce Lee.
I least expected the Porsche to get anywhere closer to those two cars. WTF did i rather saw 👀 👀
I would take the porche, it has a Clean look
The Porsche destroys you and that for half the Price...LooooL 😂😛
Lambos are just gay.
Ferrari
I would buy a porche
I’m taking Lambo SVJ
812
i would like to have porsche 911 turbo s
Haveing a Turbo is not fair if the Ferrari or Lamborghini have turbo then I think Porsche will 😢
I would rather have the Porsche, since it's the most value for money. But since it wasn't in this video, i'd have the Ferrari
porsche is winning like always
Porsche 911 turbo s without a doubt... Action is powerful than words😀
Porsche 911
812
Porsche. The other two are overpriced toys.
Svj
Ferrari and Lambo: V12 broom broom Porsche: hehe I go woosh
I think Ferrari won and it's has good looking because it's very fast as another cars
911 100%
"The silent killer.."
Lamborghini aventador and Porsche
Porsche 650 HP 156.000 euro killer ferrari & lambo 🤣
Yanni and matt aways better !
Porsche
When ever I see a Porsche 911 Turbo is on a drag race then the race is between other cars...Such a Mental car...
I would have the svj
SVJ any day
Turbo s all day long
Please stop calling it poooosch     It's PorschE!!! With an e at the end
Yeni  face was funny when he was losing race
mat cheated the second drag race
I am a Porsche fan - but I must humbly admit - that Ferrari and Aventador has a presence which is unrivalled by the 911.
Matt’s face when he reved the Ferrari 😭😭😳😂😂
Is that Dutch 😂😂😂😂👍🏼
Yianni actually jumped the start on the first round and Mat on the second
the Ferrari sounded better
Ferrari 812 all day
You both got still beaten tho👎👎👎
Ohh another drag race. Lets see who is gonna get deleted by the Turbo S today.
L think
This guy is funny...
Porsche anyday
Its amazing. Porsche is the best. But sound exhaust still Ferrari
3 seconds in the vid and i even liked it Biiiiiaaaaaaaa*chhhhhh xD
I bet porsche
Мэт с Янни это ващще угар.
I want the Porsche so bad but the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ is such a shocker that its hard for me what to buy! 😆
I'd get the Porsche!
God I love Porsche.
Porsche is the best car indeed 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Best drag race ever.
Porsche all the way although you needed a GT2 RS to compete with the other 2 but no matters the outcome is still the same with the little brother
Yianna jumped the start and that Porsche still came through. Porsche is ridiculously fast!
The Porsche is just all engineering and no flashing. No show just go. And that's exactly what I love about it.
911 turbo S
It's not fair for the great 812 it's RWD and both the cars are AWD it would smash them if it was AWD we've seen at the rolling race. Thank you matt and always happy to see yanni
Great vid! Love the look of the ferrari!
The Porsche all the wayyyyyy
Who knew that the cheapest car would win
I like the porsche
Sound and Optik i like the Ferrari. Dream Car 😍
When I saw the title, I already knew the Porsche won , the only supercar that could take from a standing start would be a 720s
Ferrari sounds the best
I would have the porche
Cardiff Mafia🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇬🇧, where you at?
Ma lo sanno che ci sono anche certi italiani in grado di parlare fluentemente inglese?
Svj😍😍
But even v12 is slower in acceleration the lambo and Ferrari's sound are orgasmic 😍  The lambo is like an angry bodybuilder  The Ferrari Is the elegance  The porche is... Something else not better defined but really fast
i will have the Porsche please.... discreet machine
Ferrari/Porsche/Lamborghini in last place for me... Ferrari are just beautifully built cars.. never been a fanboy of Lamborghini
Porsche is insane...
Yianni behaving like Needles from back to the future 3
Lamborghini
What ever man lambo will give a run to their money in hell
I love the 812's sound
The Porsche is literally that quiet kid in class that has an ak in his backpack until the moment comes
I'll have the porsche anyday
Porsche is love
I would pick the Porsche not just because it won at the drag races and brake test i just love the Germans engineering i mean its down 6 cylinders (I know cylinders don't=power or whatever) and still showed up probably the best car there i just love the Porsche's capability to keep up and beat some of the best super-cars around.
Have they Dyno’d a stock 992 Turbo S yet? There’s just no way it’s 650HP to the crank
Lol🤣😂
That PDK is no joke in the 911
Lamborghini svj
I stopped breathing when Mat started the drag
I'd have the Porsche as it aslo has a luxuries interior with the performance..
The porsche: Hold my cold tires
Porsche is crazyyyyyy!!!! :D <3 Porsche is like me, not the best looking, but has the best punch!
I’d take the 812 for sure
The best car channel ever
Get the Lambo and sell it then buy a Porsche
Been putting some amazing feed mat..... Loving the drags since day 1 of ur channel ❤
Would have the Ferrari any day
superfast❣
Porsche all day!!
What is this porshe 911?
SVJ sounds awesome
That Porsche is something ELSE!
When i see a lambo i know its yani
so turbo s is the best car ever with the best price.
Ferrari 812 super fast
Superfast!
I prefer the 812
Ferrari 812
Without a doubt, Porsche
ok, so, the SVJ is a track car, you just cant daily it. The porsche is by far the best daily but is a bit boring on the looks 'just another porsche', so ill take the Ferrari like a comprimise of both, it looks gorgeous, sounds gorgeous and you can daily it!
Porsche was a beast , the ferrari looks sweeet
Svj
911
The best drag race so far!  It's the combo of everything good.  Fastest cars, funny accents and humor from Matt, and the perfect ultra-competitive guest Yianni!
The Porsche is the winner 😂 what a monster of a car
Turbo S. Made in Germany. Any questions?
that italian impression eerily reminds me of richard hammond reviewing a lamborghini from the good ol top gear days.
I would take the 812 all day long
I'll have the Porsche, of course. With an aftermarket exhaust, to make some proper noise ;)
Porsche 911 Turbo S wow wow wow
my word😳😳porsche is really back with a bang! it does so effortlessly.
I’d take the Ferrari for the prestige, lambo for making a statement, but eventually would have the Porsche for its practicality and gentle dominance.
Of course I'd have the Ferrari
The 911 Turbo S is half the price of Italian supercars.  Faster than the Italian supercars.  And infinitely more reliable than the Italian supercars.  Which would I choose?   No contest.  Porsche FTW
German horses are stronger than italien...
Porsche is a Porsche can't be touched
I quit my 9-5 because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
If I had to pick one car for my life then it would be the Porsche. But if I have enough money then my next car will be the Ferrari 🐒
i would want the ferrari
It's got to be the Porsche 911 Turbo 😊😊😊
The svj can't really keep up with roll racing because of the massive wing
lambo will loose, guess...
hi matt im from brazil. what if you guys make a drag race with the top sport car from frrari x porsche x lambo ? love your videos !
Svj 🔥
Guy in the Porsche did not drive it right during the 2nd Rolling race
Porsche
Lamborghini...........
I love that f%$ porsche so bad lol
Amazing drag race but why you not put with them 720s to compare wich is better between  Svj 812 720s
U know why u can't win vs the Porsche? Cause it's a Porsche.  No matter how much HP more or NM more or what ever u have.. it's not a Porsche. Haha
Porsche is like that kid in year 9 that beats the year 11’s in the race.
Obviously Ferrari all day every day
That Porsche though? Damn! Cheaper, less power but the better car! I mean like damn! That Turbo S is crazy
Any drag race with Yanni and Matt instantly becomes very interesting and exciting.
Somethings wrong with the Ferrari, it's usually easily able to cream this race, even from a standstill. On breaking though the Porsche is unbeatable.
Ferrari sounds the best
Porsche period .
The Porsche 911 Turbo S is such a car!! It looks casual comparing to the Lambo and the Ferrari, but the Porsche did the job.
Porsche!
I’ll take the Porsche anyday because it’s the quickest and Porsche fanboy over here
I never leave a comment but I have to state: - Mat's accent is hilarious - The Ferrari looks the best - Lambo is overkill for me...  - Porsche is the ceapest, most comfortable and also the fastest, best of these 3...:D
Few jumped starts in this episode🤣 yanny is too funny in these tho
There must be a Jockey driving that porsche
Do a wrangler Vs Defender drag race or tug of war
Porsche
At least pronounce 812 in Italian in the beginning
Hahahah the Porsche voice got me pissing myself
That Porsche brilliantly typifies German engineering. Problem statement - go fast. Efficiently solved. Never in a million yrs would I have thought it’d best those two cars. Germany, stand up, take a bow. 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Porsche
Of course if I have the money,  I will chose the Porsche
Porsche 911 turbo S all day!! It’s also the cheaper one out of the three so it’s a no-brainer
I would buy a Porsche 911 turbo s
Technology vs spagetti cars 🤣
this not even the fastest porsche
The Porsche driver was slow to react in both the races or lambo/ferrari jumped the gun
Hey
Porsche is casually winning all the races and no one gives a shit
Porsche all day every day
Best looking car?  obviously the car Yanni is in😎
Gotta have the 812 just because of that screaming v12
Yanni Always acting like he's gonna eat the horse 🐎 😂😂. I mean 5:25 look at his face.
Haha I love you guys. You are Amazing
Porche
Make a race with the Mclaren 765lt
Porsche is just wow, easily the best bang for buck  But I would rather have the lambo  And that 812 looks the best sorry yanny  But I think I would rather have the bull it's got more personality
Yeeeeees Porsche will ALWAYS be the best
Porsche all the way
Spot on Italian accent😂😂😂
I clearly want the Porsche, but not in this color...
Porsche is literally the best car ever
Amg gt bs vs Ferrari f12 n- lago vs Lamborghini svj
I eager to see the Porsche 911 gt turbo s against the McLaren 720 s
The best sounding drag race on this channel. Those V12s!!!!
Matt jumped the start for the second drag race...he knows it aswell hahahaha
Petition for the 488 pista to have a comeback. We ferrari guys need redemption
That freaking Porsche is insane!!!
German engineering
Your prononciation is wrong with Porsche
Lamborghini sounds the best
Porsche ❤️
The Porsche any day man
911
porsche is the best
Bet Mat can't differentiate German from France 😂
Yanni is prolly like 200kgs....!!! Hmmm I wonder why it did 10.4...
Porsche definitely
Firrari
All of them I’d have
Too much downforce for the lambo
Ferrari ofc
Out of all the races I've watched, this was the most intense🔥🔥🔥
If you listen carefully to the turbo s exhaust, you can hear it say "Silent but deadly".
Porsche is definitly the best 😌
MAKE A DRAG SERIES !!     TUNER VS SUPERCARS
6:22 Matt`s brake lights still on while Yanni was already moving..... Yanni jumpstarted..... AGAIN!
Germans and Italian king of the automobile
812
I prefer Porsche
When the cool kids gets a beating by a nerd that's what's going on here
Roses are red Violets are blue The moment you came for is 5:22
THE TURBO S IS A FUCKING BEASTTT 🔥🔥🔥
Really disappointed in aventador it was my favourite car but every frekin car is faster from it in rolling race!
10:56  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Porsche and lamborghini
Ferrari
Porsche all the way!!!
I'd have the 812 any day
Porsche sounds like a vacuum cleaner.
Imagine how fast the new Porsche GT3 RS will be....
ferrari
Yanni always jumps the start but he still looses. To answer your question it's the "Porsche" ❤️
Do rs6 c7 vs porsche 911 turbo s
yanni jumped the start on the first run by a good half a second and still lost
Should add an AMG GT Black series,,
812 Superslow
Porsche 🇩🇪 ❤️ 👍 👍 👍 💪💪💪🎥👍
Lamborghini
German Engineering work🥰😘
I dont see yet but: 1st porsche 2nd ferrari 3rd lambo Drag race off course
Porche in silent killers
812 superslow
Porsche 911 Turbo S
That Lambo is fugly. Ferrari not much better.
100% Porsche
Any day lamborghini aventador SVJ💯💯
Finally the race everyone was waiting for
Porsche.
turbo s
would love to see a mclaren senna in one of these
Wow Porsche is making their cars so good
Ferrari
Is Porsche just here to check how much both cars stand up to it?
Lamborghini sounds great
Porsche nd Ferrari my love ❤️
these drag races just keep getting better and better
porche
Ferrari 812 Superfast
Ferrari: Roarrr! Lamborghini: RAWRRRR!!! Porsche: meow...
Porsche is the best even though it's 3.0 ltr it's been better than both 6.5 naturally aspirated engine I would buy Porsche rather than a costly car which never stand a chance against Porsche also it's not bad at its look .Porsche was not good at sound you mentioned earlier  It was equipped with soft limiter therefore if it was without soft limiter it  would beat Ferrari and Lamborghini I think so.
The Lambo's gearbox is really disappointing
The SVJ sounds like a RACE CAR🙈🙈🙈   SWEET VIOLENT SOUND. Yanni in the Lambo was amazing. Ppl saying they take the Porsche are straight up CAPPIN
Porsche looks best. Porsche all day
I would buy the 992 Porsche Turbo S because it's the best car in the world. It just needs an exhaust and is perfect
Bro that Ferrari is soo sick!!
Definitely the 911 turbo s
The fact that Porsche won the drag race against Lamborghini is blowing my mind.
Would have Ferrari F12
812 Superfast any day all day!
I would have to get the Porsche it is just a better car for high speed driving which is surely the point of this!! Ferrari and Lamborghini have become more like a super car luxury brand rather than one that cares about the cars speed and acceleration.
I would have a aventador svj   If it had a different driver he would have won
Come on its a svj like who would not have it
SVJ anyday!
Lets face it ferrari and Lamborghini are for bellends porsche all day evey day
If it was free. I would have the Lambo, then sold it, and bought a Porsche and a little appartament for investment
The lambo here is my least fav. But yanni has to be my fav.
So the Porsche 911 Turbo S is the fastest Supercar🤔?
It pains to say but i think The Ferrari sounds the best
Porsche just sods off! Absolutely insane!
Porsche 911 👍👍👍
I'd have the 812 every day
the 911 turbo s sucks at rolling race
SVJ sounds the bests stock. But a novitev 812 superfast sounds godly.
If the perfomante was in here it would have clearly won😂
Ill take all 3
Get the SVJ, sell it and get the Porsche and a G class
Not that the Prosche is faster more important its the best quality and tech car from these three 🤷🏻‍♂️
Porsche 911 just looks classier than both the others
Accents 10/10
Xenthy!!!! Sente o poder de um Porsche, destronando Ferrari e lamborghine.
Best Sound Lamborghini by a mile. Personally I would love the Ferrari. But wouldn't say no to the Porsche. Just something about it
Me clicking on this video: “I wonder who’s going to come second”
Turbo car vs non turbo. It was pre-fixed porche win.
Porsche
German Engineering
The car with the least horsepower smokes the car with the most horsepower. .!! And love the way you  was talking in starting. .!!
I would have the Lamborghini, sell it and then buy the Porsche
SVJ OBVIO🔥
911 is incredible.
I'll take the porsche turbo s... Everytime!
All we know what a FERRARI can do!!!   And I like the FERRARI!!! ♦️♥️🚘
I'd have the Porsche, any day every day. I like my cars practical and usable on the daily.
9:27 lol :p
I gave this video a thumbs down because they didn't know the lambo doing donuts from the outside, very disappointing.
Is that a dent on Turbo?
Yanni jumped it at first
The Stuttgart slayer doing what it does best
Ferrari looks the best for me, but i love what Porsche did, what a amazing performance
Ferrari all day every day!!!!!
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Actually you sounds like german accent haha
Ferrari sounds better
Porsche 911 s
911 is the ONE. Beaten both of them in drag, rolling(1st) and brake test. Half the price, looks good to me too.
if pick only ONE of this - Porsche. Its just better car in every terms. But if you have already cars and need something for your child inside - SVJ ofc))))))))))
Pls vote this comment up, cuz i RLLY wanna see a dragrace between the McLaren 720S vs Porsche Taycan Turbo S 👀 gotta know the result of that!
Yeah porsche dominate till the first corner when lambo ALA system kicks in
Porshe is the king 👑
How's win
Ei vould haf ze Porsche
Porsche all the way i just wish they could increase the hoarse power of that 911 turbo to 800 horse power
Porsche 🇩🇪
Matt jumped the start!!!!!
looks like the porsche not exist
Ferrari for thr looks and sound and porsche for the performance!!
Obviously svj
That Porsche is godly.
I like the ferrari
Porsche Porsche Porsche!!
7:18 look at the background. There’s a silver ghost pulling away.
11:56 oh hang on Yammie, whatcha words... Porsche indeed is the best looking car, you just don't have the taste for it.
Ferrari all the way
Wonder how that Turbo S gonna perform with TechArt tuning
Porsche
The scenario is such that the 911 turbo s takes all the trash talking before a fight calmly, is a smaller opponent but on the day of the fight shuts off the bigger opponents like a champ.   All three are unique in their own ways but damn the 911 is engineering at it’s finest 👌🏻
please make p1 vs 918 vs la ferrari happen!
Lambos and ferraris : Nooo you can't just beat our Big V12s with a flat 6 !! Porsche : Haha 911 go brrr
Почему перестали переводить на русский
Lamborghini Aventador svj
I'm not see the full video yet but Porsche gonna win ite easily!
Svj need dual clutch Asf
Lambo and Ferrari: MOO POWAAAH BABE Porsche: Another day, another win
we need dodge challenger demon in the drag race
Porsche any day
svj of course
I'd have the Ferrari for the show and the porsche for the performance SCREW THE LAMBO😂😂
At those prices .... the Porsche please.  and it gives you a smooth , soft and silent ride on long road trips !
porsche sounds best
Yo props to matt for that amazing accent in the beginning.😂🔥
Yanni jump of the line
Ferrari prove you don't need 4wd Porsche prove you don't need high horsepower Lamborghini prove you have high horsepower and 4wd is useless if you are bull
I have never seen any Ferrari this dominant against Lamborghini SVJ, I will get that 812 Superfast any day, every day..
812 superfast ALL DAY!!!!!!
You can buy two 911 turbo S and and a Cayman for the price of that lambo
Yanni cheats every time, he always starts early
Love these vid with yanni so entertaining
Ferrari v12 sounds feminine compared to the lambo.
911 Turbo S 👌👌👌
Porsche is a quietest kid in class
992
Yianni jumped 💯
Money no object...Who wouldn't have all of them!!!!
You are such a troll
imagine the next gt2rs ;)
Did Carwow get a deal with ITV? Matt talks a little; ADVERT. He talks a little more; ADVERT. During the races; CONSTANT ADVERTS.
Porsche understated dominance!
mat: starter why do u have head phones on? starter: becuz that lamborghini that yianni is in defens me when it passes by also id have the SVJ A car can be faster than an aventador but nothin on earth is louder than an aventador
Germany products are best everytime
No Yianni, that Lambo looks like shit
This was the greatest carwow drag race
I’m choosing the 812. Best looking by far
I've said it before and i'll say it again, how the fuck did they make that Porsche?
I think an all ferrari drag race would be really nice, 812 vs F8 vs SF90 or something like that
The Porsche is fast as hell but that Lamborghini is something else, the sound of the V12......holy fuck.
Imagine the svj with a duelclutch gearbox
Definitely the Porsche, more practical than the 2, faster than the 2 and with the smallest engine it’s most definitely the most fuel efficient of the 3. Oh and it’s the cheapest
I would definitely go for porsche
Lambo sounds better
Porsche
Porsche? no matter
I always go with the underdog so i would get the Porsche. They are sneaky fast.
Porsche is the best looking car
porsche 911 turbo s
Love you guys awesome video....
would take that 812
After watching this the Porsche 911 Turbo S seems like a bargain!
Ferrari sounds the best by far.
the only car which will stand a chance against the new Porsche, is the McLaren p1 o the 918 spider, a supercar
Already knew the Porsche was winning before I clicked the video
Porche is to drag races as Merc is to F1, funny how they're both German brands. ( I know merc is a British F1 team. But let's be honest the R&D is definitely German.) Also, money no object I'd still have the Porche, this 992 gen is just gorgeous, and performant. Although my dream Porche is actually the 992 Carrera S with that GT wing pack. The lack of extra ducts and venting makes such a beautiful overall form. Stunning really. In white, with a manual please.
Lamborghini SVJ  A Lambo is a lambo
Rip lambo ferrari  Porsche power love
Can matt or yanni reply on this comment .... Seriously i love you guys . You crazy old couple 😅
I mind have the SVJ but there are so many SVJ in the World
Aventador SVJ
It's always Ferrari!!!!🖤
Lamborghini Aventador !!! ❤❤❤
Porsche is made for a quarter mile race. If it was a 1 mole race, both Italians wod have killed it as seen in the second race. Good for Porsche, love it. But, race is more than just 402 meters of straight line.
This 911 is a fucking beast!
Je suis porchiste  porche is the best
Turbo S
Lambo!  Any-day, all day! ❤️❤️❤️
That Porsche is unbelievable value for money
That Yanni is a bit of a cheat. He's always taking off before the others. Obviously a bad driver that cares more about his car being the quickest than the truth.
i would have Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
I‘m from Germany an I love all cars from Porsche but that Ferrari just fastens my heartbeat. Makes no sense to prefer the 812 but it is just pure emotion and that’s why I would rather get that one 😍
Ferarri 812 is looking better
SVJ
now what of porsche built a v12 car?
I'd rather have that Porsche
i knew the porsche would win the drag race but HOW DID IT WIN THE ROLLING RACE ?!?!?!
The Porsche would sound good if there were no laws. And the lambo is the fastest on track.
There's nothing like a Porsche.
The accents were on point
lel bruhh sarcastic completely different type of engine V
812 superfast
the new Porsche turbo smashed the Porsche Taycan turbo the most powerful quick electric car on the planet at the time being. what did u think will happen against these two relatives old car, is just a waste of time really...
Porsche Porsche Porsche Porsche Porsche Porsche Porsche Porsche Porsche Porsche Porsche
Best intro kkkkkk
If i could only have one... I would take the Lambo, sell it immediately and get 2 Turbo S. So they don’t get lonely...
Porsche ✅
8:56 **sad lamborghini noise**
Just saying I would take the svj any day
You gotta respect the Germans. That’s insane engineering.
lamboooo
I think the Ferrari sounds the best on the move but at standstill I give it to the lambo
If you put a gun to my head and told me to decide between the Lambo or the Ferrar,then you would have to pull the trigger as I wouldn't be able to decide !
What an introduction!! I am dying... Haha! Too funny!
only flat 6 and competites with the v12 s but he is the tough mate
porsche is crazy..
Porsche 911turbo s over any car.
Yianni jump start the first one though. Great race nonetheless
Porsche win because is turbocharged
Imagine Porsche building a V12 car... 😳
Porsche, all day every day💥
that porshce is amazing guys
Oh boy this is one of the all time greats!  I'd have 812 > SVJ > 911 in that order
812 Superfast
Porsche are so underrated
12:04 defo the lambo
Lamborghini: I'm double the price of you Porsche: are you double the acceleration?
The Sound to German car is out pur...
Just like Yianni says Lambo all day everyday, but we all know it’s , PORSCHE all day, everyday!! Damn that car!!! 🔥🔥🔥
812
if the Ferrari were red it would win
That Porsche is just amazing!
Yanni jumped the first race AGAIN!
I STILL DON’T UNDERSTAND why they do the rolling start race in manual locked in 3rd gear at 50mph. Absolute stupidity. Different cars produce different power in that gear at that speed. Porsche was clearly disadvantaged. I agree with rolling start at 50mph in comfort but the other one in automatic as well but in cars sportiest settings. Come on guys...
Best looking car is definitely the ferrari 812
Porsche pretty much took a shit on both of those cars, half the price and half the cylinders. Ferrari does look good though.
if u would buy the ferrari or the lambo with your own money over the porsche u are  crazy
I Have Ferrari         İn GTA Online
The fact that they are able to get these of super car together for a drag race is very impressive. Having a Ferrari is Step-Up. I understand Ferrari doesn't really like organized drag races with their cars because well ego if they lose.
Racing Motorbikes are faster than any car. Also after 190 mi/h Porsche loses
The Porsche
Thanks to internet at least we can watch :)
Porsche Turbo S, damn fine machine
I think it could be interesting when the Ferrari drag races the mc 720s
as long yianni is in the video ...... The views will increase 😂
Heart says get the 812...  But I just know at the last minute I would find myself in a Porsche dealer speccing a Turbo S 🙄😁  Zero interest in any Lambo
Rari
The 911 Turbo S is only in there to have some fun, we all know it is faster with hlaf the cylinders anyways. Like, what the hell are the italians doin?!
Porsche 💪💪💪
How did Matt win the roll ? Porsche ahead the first one up until the end. Porsche won the tests and the drag races. Don’t get why people get cut Porsche’s are the best.
you speak like a real german hahaha
My head says Porsche but my heart screams Lamborghini and that Miura SVJ. Yes, Miura! Let's see if anyone really knows Lamborghini.
Why does Yanni launch like a cartoon villain? Dick Dastardly right there
The sounds of both V12s were the scream of fear seeing a 911 next to them
Porsche's engineers put black magic on that car! How it is possible with that power and weight bit all the cars on a strait line?
SVJ looks the best and sounds great also has all the drama
me thinks lambo JUMPED the start
Yianni brings a different entertainment to this show; What a character! 😂👍🏽
Porsche sounded glorious
Yianni got that lambo crying.. Love it
VOTE Porsche 911 Turbo S
The lambo
Porsche wins over short distances due to awesome gearbox and 4wd system, Ferrari wins over long distances and rolling races, thanks to a nuke for an engine, Lamborghini is just for showponies. 4wd will always beat rwd, if 812 was 4wd it would win the drag race.
I'd take the turbo
Always go porsche.
Porsche quiet but deadly 🙌🙌
Think yanni left a little early on the first race ?
Porsche all the way. Imagine Porsche making a v12 modern supersports car
Ferrari for me
911
Porsche adore ❤️
Ferrari is the best sounding car on this channel....ever.
Porsche is Porsche!
porsche is still porsche
I'd go for the SVJ. Thats a sweet bull!
How do you effectively put 717Nm/800hp down through two wheels? I guess I'm about to find out _(or perhaps not...)._ 📺👀👌
Carwow Please combine svj and performante / evo
Porsche
Porsche of course, why spending more money for?
3:44 that screaming Ferrari omg!! 🙂
Porsche makes such wonderful cars. They are amazing
They don’t call the turbo s the silent assassin for no reason
Now i want to see bugatti and koenigseg (probably wont happen)
Lamborghini.... 10 empty space and then Another cars
Ferrari
Porsche 911 Turbo......All day everyday specially over a lambo 😎😎😎😎😎😎
I live my life a quarter mile at a time ❤️
That porshe is insane
Well if I had to pay for one for sure I'd get the Porsche, and then just get an old N/A used Ferrari as well for the sound, all of this from the price of an 812.   But if someone was to give me one of these and I had to choose, 812 all day baby. It sounds better than the Lambo for me too. Lambo is for flashy kids with rich parents. My old MG ZT shifts better than that thing. Right?
The Porsche 911 be like : why aren't they talking bout me??😂😂
ferrari
Angry V12s all day everyday 😍
Sound : Ferrari, 10x. Pure V12 high rev sound
Porsche: cant hear their exhaust sound through my rear view mirror....
Ferrari 812 is easily the best looking car
911 Turbo S -  das ist kaum zu glauben!  Preis, technische Daten und Firmenmarken - alles ist perfekt. Best Sportcar der Welt in der Geschichte
easy svj 😈
812
The Porsche is just another league
I’d have the Ferrari over the other 2
Lamborghini sound better
1:03 most British British accent I have ever heard.
Porsche any day. Lambo looks like a kids toy and the Ferrari is ugly. When dreams come true, I'll buy the Turbo S.
Porsche, yet again, doing more with less.
For those SVJ Means Super Veloche jota
The Lamborghini aventador svj
Matt stop fronting on the first rolling race you was at 185mph and still wasn’t past the Porsche
It's never about cars  It's always about Yainni vs Mat
Yanni jumped the start the first time.
Ferrari sounds best also looks best
911 turbo s...still the master ....
am i the only one who thinks yiannimize starts too early on every drag race
maybe if all the videos use that accent or style to speak everytime
Porsche is a BEAST !!!
Svj all day every day best sounding and it’s an icon it is the last na v12 tho the gearbox is a tragedy but I’d still Choose that over the other 2
Porchre macht erstaunliche Autos Mann
That intro tho hahaha
It’s like that saying - useless empty cans are noisier than the one that is full.   Porsches doesn’t need to be loud.
That 911 exhaust sounds the BEST
Ferrari sounds best
Porsche really made a car to embarrass the rest of the "super" cars
Porsche is the best car there
Money no object...? Two 911's thanks, and I still haven't spent as much as you would on one SVJ.
Amazing Lambo! Stayed with that turbo boring thing...
Taycan beating the best tesla and now 911 beating the best lambo and Ferrari... WOW, What a brand!!! Absolutely amazing and awesome.  I  recently bought my first 981, definitely shooting for turbo S the next! Go PORSCHE!!!!!
Porsche for ever ❤️ but bro they need too change the revs sound!!!
Yianni, I thought you have a Avendator? Is that a SV?
إيطالي عبارة!!🤣😂😂🤣
Bring the sf90 and we will see
Never really understood why people say Porsche's are for women. Such an iconic look , great quality and as seen here, great performance for the price.
Would like to see a 1 mille race.
Lambo false start
911 isn't a carr but it's a emotion for car enthusiastics
Porsche always
Porsche is gonna crush them
would have the porsche 911 turbo any day
Porsche is still the most beautiful engineering masterpiece. The rest are show off toys.
Porsche all day long.  Ferrari as a garage queen.... Mansory  R8 sorry I mean Lamborghini for pretend playboys.
Smash it porsche
812 vs svj vs 720 s rolling race please do it
The 812 looks the best, the svj is a track toy, it'd be quite challenging to daily it aand the 911 is the best all rounder, more of a low key option
How this turbo s?? oh my... Of course i would pick that as a fanboy of porsche but it also surprises me anytime with how fast and stable it is!
L'imitazione italiana era molto simpatica!
Porsche all day. Would buy a 911 or Panamera over any Lambo or Ferrari 100%
It's called Porsche not Posch😂
Accento italiano PESSIMO!!! ahahahahah
Jesus that porsche rips and thats not that gt variant.
It’s official carwow is king of hot car content 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The ferrari look the nicest, So for the looks i would pick the ferrari, For the speed te porsche ofcourse.
911: straight line Aventador svj: track 812: autobahn
Hey Matt, it’s time to Supercars.... Chiron, P1, Sena, CCX, Zonda, ....
Yanni is only focusing on mat gives a shit about the Porsche 😂😂😂😂
Money no object definitely the Ferrari.
Porsche all day long!!
Race a Dodge Challenger Demon against this porsche?
7:12 is for for the dreamers
Porsche: "why the heck you are so loud, when you're going too slow. :p"
Ferrari’s TPS can’t handle high acceleration, Italian! I would have the Porsche as my daily as well as my track car
Porsche is the only one that didnt jumped the start
7:12 is for for the dreamers
Porsche
I personally thought the Ferrari sounded the best. And although I like the Porsche, I would take the Ferrari. Lamborghinis have never done much for me.
Porsche all the way! Stylish and understated with performance that will surprise.
That Porsche......
Ferrari
Definitely a Porsche..
That Ferrari looks amazing, but Porsche is an incredible pice of engineering, and a  different but good driver driving experience.  No comment for the Lambo circus and Yanni the joker.
How is the Porsche winning?
Porsche forever ✌🏼🇩🇪
In America Mr. Watson you would be racially insensitive for doing those horrible accents . People of America is getting way to sensitive :(   I would take the Porsche because it’s cheaper and better .
812 SF anyday
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Porshe💪
i would have the superfast
Id take the ferrari without thinking. mountain drives with that V12 is just a master piece.
lamborghini
German engineering🔥
Porsche is that one quiet kid in class who comes in with a gun and murders everyone
I'd have the Lambo
Porsche for life babyyyy
Porsche, no doubts, less attention, faster and in my opinion way better look!
@ 12:02 The "Porsch"
try a porsche techart 992 from dj la fuente
Ferrari 🔥🔥🔥
Looks wise the Ferrari takes the cake I mean just look at at it😍♥️
Matt...That lamborghini SVJ vs. La Ferrari...That will be great!
Porsche just demolishes all takers
That Porsche is a demon
I wish the Porsche could sound better!
lambo deserves a better coulor
Lambo
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Porshe
I'd have the Porsche! The others are too flashy for me.
Porsche for me..
Waiting for the 911 992 GT2RS!!!
Lambo each day everyday!
I knew it! Yianni is in the House Again 😂
Well I love the Lambo But i also love the Ferrari But budget wise seems like Porsche is better option though.,,,  But wait!!    My pockets don't allow me this luxury, at least for now :P
Defo would have the porsche more boot space fast enough german engineering so less likely to break down then ferrari and lambo 😆
what if PORSCHE have same power as lambo and feraari
I'd have the porsche between the three. Low profile, daily driveable car with the potential to be really fast if you want
I have the Lambo to sell and buy the Porsche and use the change to buy and pimp out a Lotus Exige for track days...the end
911 turbo S, ANY FUCKIN DAY.
Are we not gonna talk about matt being able to do the italian and german accents perfectly?
Porshe is the best
Porsche = Small Rocket 🚀 😍✌🏻 Small flat engine (( V6= 3.8 L )) kills huge engines (( V12 = 6.5 L )) it's beat the both of Lambo + Ferrari 😂✌🏼😂 Hello Porsche 👋🏻♥️👌🏼
I Absolutely Would Have PORSCHE 😏
Porsche every day
L'Italia tiene le macchine migliori del mondo ❤🇮🇹
this was two hours ago
I’d say the Ferrari is best looking
Ferrari 812 or Porsche 911 Turbo S for sure
AND THATS WHY I LOVE PORSCHE'S!! GERMAN ENGINEERING 👌
I would buy thé Porsche!
If I can afford it the Ferrari
The porsche dual clutch is just mindblowing!!!!
Lamborghini
German Engineering.
Lambo
On the first race the Lambo cheated going on ‘1’.
The superfast is by far the best looking!!
That moment When u pay 360.000£ v12 to get passed by inline 6 porsche
Yanni was the loudest!!!!
Porsche Ferrari Lumbooooolol
Amo ese porsche es una verdadera bestia y es hermosooo
Porsche please
Love germen technology😎😎😎😎
Ferrari sounds better
We now know why Porsche ties with Apple only. Underpowered yet highly optimised. *forget the price anomaly
Germans always WIN.
I’d have the Ferrari I mean let’s be honest
the Turbo S for sure would be where my money goes!  its actually looks very handsome, and no not the most outlandish or childish. dont get me wrong,  i do love the lambo design. but its a steep compromise when it comes to usability and visibility out of the bloody thing!  the 812 is really amazing but its overweight... :(  i love v12 engines, specially N/A because they sing a glorious song. and both the lambo and the Ferrari got v12s so thats a BIG plus.  but at the end of the day the Turbo S is a LOT cheaper to buy, brand new, and you could throw 50K worth of options and it would be still over 150K cheaper or so then the Lambo... let that sink in!  its more usable too. its a cake you can buy and use it daily to work or for a nice blast across the country to some really fun roads ^^ and lets not forget the amazing euro mountain passes ^^
Porsche be like: ahh shit here we go again plus i wanna see a race between the 918 and the turbo s
Porsche ❤️
Yianni Lezgoooow
911 Turbo S
Definitely would take the 911
Lambo would easily defeat porsche and ferrari with a dual cluth transmission
"I killed that ferrari" he just flored it and car goes straight by itself. And also the car it's not even owned by him. This type of guys are gross from my perspective
porsche all day long.
I've never seen someone more desperate to win than Yani.
Turbo s
I prefer the ferrari
Ferrari
I swear matt we have made the same expression when you rev’d up that black beast. Daaammmmnnnn!!!!
Race starts at 5:22 thank me later
Porsche ❤️
MORE LIKE FERRARI VS LAMBO
Again, Yianni jumps the start!
Porsche, that damn Porsche brand
A simple v6 twin turbo has killed two v12 cars 😅...
Turbo S looks better
The power the engine ferrarri the sound ferrarri  The feeeling and the performances in the turn lambo svj and ferrarri The brake porsche The grip lambo The most complete lambo  But the easyly car to drive all day 911 always So in my heart the 812 wins
Bring out the new 2020 mclaren 765lt vs the new porshe 911 turbo S
I would have a Mercedes CL500
No one is talking about the Porschr throughout the clip because they all knew it was going to win every time. I am really curious how well it fares against the SVJ on a track. I guess we'll have to wait for the new 911 GT2 to beat the currently best Lambo.
no one fucks with germans for cars
Ferrari is so ridiculous.  🇩🇪💪🏼
Super Fast Black all life👍
Porsche = All go no show
Lamborghini Aventador, all day... everyday!❤️
When u pay 360.000£ v12 to get passed by v6
Porsche ❤️anyday!
Yianni always jumps the start
Where is the Porsche when we talk about speed? Ferrari😍❤
I’m Italian and we don’t speak in this way buttt u make me laugh in every video😂😂🇮🇹🇬🇧🇮🇹🇬🇧
Porsche definitely
What porsche??😂😂😂
Porsche fans be like:.."work hard in silence let your results make noise"..!!!
P o r s c h e
Ferrari looks the best
Поршь наказал всех и даже Макларен 720 !
SEE-YIANNI put a cap on after you had yours on the other day.
hours and 250k views….wow
ALSO MAT u went at 195 Mph!!!
Hey I want a drag race between porsche 911 turbo s  ,  porsche gt2rs.  Ferrari 488 speciale.  And McLaren 720s
We need a 992 Turbo S vs 765LT race
It’s crazy how so many people still don’t understand how fast Porsche are.
Always Porsche and they are reliable . Lambos and Ferraris are very high maintenance cars and always have some kind or the other reliability issues
Porsche always the King
No one is buying that porshe, unless they already own the lambo.
let's appreciate Mat's introduction with his unique accents.. bravo Mat
It's always been the case, every manufacturer comes out with their fastest car ever, and then Porche says, here ..... check this out.  Not only that but it has power seats, stereo, air conditioning  etc etc.  What do they call it ...oh ya .... Porche DNA.
Porsche 911 turbo S
Nothing new here, Porsche 👌🏼
Love the Porsche, change left in the wallet. Great cars.
Lambo ofc
Race starts at 5:20
The Ferrari😍😍😍😍😍😍
That win was insulting
Ferrari 💋💋💋
Porsche is reasonable and innovative
So Porsche is half the price and beat the both of you yet the video was pretty much Lambo V Porsche.
Funny to see the Porsche winning easy!
THAT PORCHE!!!
I really enjoy these videos! Thank you and keep up the good work, mate
Porsche all the way
Porsche: Turbo charged flat 6 with German engineering The Italian Bois: BIG V12 GO BRRRROOOOOOOMMM!!!
Yiany really pisses me off he always jumps the starts
Rip Chadwick Boseman
Which I’d have money no object and had to keep (not sell)... the Porsche
Just goes to proove noisy exhausts do nothing but annoy pedestrians and animals. 911 is a no brainer.
The.Lambo seats is bad.Will go for Porsche
I would 100% have Porsche, it's so fast
I whould rather a naturally aspirated car than that porsche with a forced engine
German accent : we will let ze Italian children play in ze front and show ze world what we do silently.
The Porsche I want it!!!! German engineering yeah. But please Porsche what do you want with the soft limiter? Please guys don‘t buy any car with soft limiter!!! Hope they will change it then.
Why there's a soft limiters!!!??! Soft limiters is useless and it should'nt exist!
My favorite sound was the Ferrari
I would have the lambo to sell it and buy 3 porsche then
Porsche end of story. U Gay's go play something.
To be honest I like the Porsche the best. Not just for its better design and performance but also the sound. It may not sound better in this video but in real life it sounds amazing
I'll have the "gray thing".
The SVJ looks wayyyy better than both.
That 911 is a beast!!
The lambo is loud , but the ferrari sounds better
Ferrari looks the best
I would honestly have the Porsche
I want lambo to win
After 1/2 and 1 mile, that porsche havent chance vs the 812 sf and the svj
Turbo s is just a beast, but you guys should had a porsch gt2rs in this race (price wise and horsepower) to even things up, gt2rs just as quick as turbo s 0-60 but rolling race I think it would beat the ferrari and lambo easily with its 700hp, pricewise it’s still a lot cheaper than the rari and the lambo haha
I love lamborgine svj and never talk shit about car  you have put nos bottle in your car stupid
Best: Super Veloce Jota
For me the best sound in a drag race ever🤤
Svj
That porche has just embarrassed Lamborghini and Ferrari owners. Literally half the price for a better car
Probably one of the best drags they've done....
i would take the porsche ^^ just pure understatement if you compare it to these loud italian kids
Yani is so intense!
Porsche 🇩🇪 ❤️ the best car 💪🏽
When I saw the Lamborghini yanni pops in my mind🤣🤣
The Porsche is impressive but let's be honest.  We're all taking the Lamborghini
If money was no object my rank is:  1) Porsche 911 Turbo S  2) Ferrari 812 Superfast 3) Lamborghini Aventador SVJ (sorry Yianni)
The best drag race so far love it. Yianny must always attend this races
porsche turbo s
Ferrari!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I will get a 911 for me
I love all of the cars 🚗
I mean it's just taste, but I love the desing of the Porsche the best. It's so clean and classy. The other two just scream "look at me"
Yanni's reaction alone can add 100bhp to his car
812
I would always choose the 812 over the others
Drag race between 812 vs 720s as they have same time 10.4 sec
Ferrari is king
Yanni jumped the start of the first race, Porsche dominance yet again though
i would have the ferrari
If it is a lambo it is Yannie in it
Lamborghini aventador
812 forever!!!!!!
Ferrari is just so much better in my mind. So elegant yet angry looking, super fast (well of course the awd cars beat it on the stand still but it came neck and neck with the lambo even though its 200killos heavier AND rwd only!) its a ferrari, and it's pretty much going to be the last all v12 car so it's an investment as well.
Lol u can always predict which car Mat is in
If it Lamborghini, it is Yianni 👍
STILL LOVE THE SUPERFAST😂🔥
Hi guys. you pronounce PORSCHE wrong !!!!!! You say PORSH, but it is PORSCHE !!!
I want to see the 918 Spyder race the Turbo S!
The Lambo is simply an attack on all the senses and in years to come also an epic investment, as all rare Lambo's always are
The SVJ obviously won the sound test
German engineering is just the best
I am not a Porsche Fanboy but I love this particular Porsche 911 Turbo S...The level of engineering done in this car is just amazing...
Ferrari all time
That 911 Turbo S is just something else!!
Hate u from Pakistan
Lamborghini always Lamborghini
SVJ!
Ferrari sf90 stradale Lamborghini aventador svj Porsche 911 turbo s Mclaren 765lt Lamborghini huracan performante
Start of the race at 5:20
The ferrari sounded the best! That engine screams! The lambo's seems the ferrari's with a sorethroat
Lol i dont understand why people are really comparing between the Porsche and Lamborghini...i dont think people understand that both are from the Volkswagen Group
I would have my dream car lamborghini aventador svj
Learn to drag first han race
Matt.. You are good at this!! Awesome job!
Mat with a Hat
PORSCHE!
Mat cheated on the second drag
Wow🔥
You gotta go for the 812 Superfast, it's just a beast and a beauty !
I would take the Ferrari from these three cars.....a very emotional car and no VW like the Lamborghini or Porsche
Turbo s
U don't have got winning mind set ..  I love Ferrari
Lamboghini aventador svj
Ferrari,  I would have the Ferrari.
Out of the 3 you've got to be having the Lambo. The Ferarri just says "small penis" and the Porsche just says "accountant".  The Lambo says "crazy motherfucker who likes to go fast".
Lamborghini 👍
Ferrari is thebest
Porsche
Turbo
Yianni's life depends on these drag races 😂 always puts a smile on my face watching these two big kids 😂👏
Porsche 911❤️❤️❤️❤️
Lambo
911 Turbo S
So if taking an svj along should the Porsche be a gt3rs?!? In any case turbo s is clearly best car ever...apart from noise (new exhaust would fix that)
812 SuperFast for sure!!!!!
Yanni reaction while driving is the funnest 🤣🤣
I don't understand why every time someone is about to review an Italian car has to let us know his version of an Italian accent 😑 which by the way, mostly for Italians, is very annoying and also because is not the actual accent is the mocking of the cliche accent which it makes it even more disturbing. So you might think "relaaax, is funny take it easy" ... but I have to say that to me is not funny is annoying, as I mentioned before, cause I want to watch a car video and all the time I have to go through this mocking tax, which is kind of tiring so I'm off this channel ... I leave to you all this kind of comedy' reviews
Porsche's numbers don't add up lool I'm baffled suppose to be the slowest car...
Lambo looks ridiculous, almost childish
Yellow ferrari
1st race Yianni jumped
I'd take the Ferrari
I love lambos but Jeremy Clarkson said it best, lambos are meant to look good at 11pm outside of a club doing 30mph downtown. If you want a fast car, buy a Ferrari
Porsche 992 turbo s all day long!
ill pic Porsche but b happy w any lol
Can you drag race a dodge demon
Love yanni man soo funny
9:28 Ferrari or: even the things which show something is wrong are wrong
What production supercar can really rival the 911 Turbo S right now? Can't think of one...
🇮🇹
lambo
Porsche 911 Turbo S all day long!
Porsche 911 Turbo S
When the quite Porsche kid of the class comes to the drag strip.
Soon as I saw Yanni.....the smile on my face was so huge
I'm actually surprised that you can beat the SVJ for £200,000 less German engineering i guess...
Porsche only the best
That black horse 🐎 looks so sweet
1 would have the lambo and sell it then buy the porsche😁
I’m usually a Lambo  man  but the Ferrari looks unreal
Ferrari all day, every day.
Thought Yianni's cap had the Brad Binder logo on it
Porsche is my choice.💪🍻
3:20 My own personal cars?😂 I see an EV bike and a Mojave, Matt 😂💔
Porsche. I knew it was gonna be the best all rounder
Porche 918
SVJ Lamborghini
Golf 7.5r vs c43 amg vs s3
Turbo S all day long...  😎
Why not Porsche RS2, is better for this drag race
Svj
PORSCHE ❤️
Yanny sounds like ripping rev limiter 4 cylinder civic on red light. Idk why
You guys forgot about the 720s that would be a killer.
Haha typical Yanni jump start and still gets owned
Yianni🥳🥳🥳
Please, u should bring something which beat the porche
porsche is the most elegant
The svj is rare in this channel but iv'e never seen a bugatti doing drag race in this channel
Porsche,all the way
Ferrari all day. I really don’t care if the Porsche is 0.2secs faster!
Brain and heart say Ferrari ..
Ferrari
Ahh that bromance! 😂 SVJ ftw. 👍
Ferrari sound the best👌
You don't race fair . U keep slow Japanese car and bike to promote European cars and bikes . So I don't watch it
That Ferrari is the perfect one for me. U get the glorious V12 and some practicality. The Porsche is mental and the Lambo is cool but that Ferrari does a bit of both.
Sound test 4. Porsche 3. Ferrari 2. Lambo 1. YIANNII
Porsche
SVJ for me
The Turbo S defies everything, such a stunning car
Lamborghini Aventador svj
I thought the Porsche would be a GT3 this or that but no! So basically the Porsche is the bargain of the supercar world. Respect!
You'd be gutted that the cheapest car and with it being down on power would dominate two super cars 😂😂😂
I kinda' hate Ferrari as a company, but if I had to choose one, money not involved, I'd choose the 812. It just ticks the most petrol head boxes. The only "downside" would be the center-front engine placement. But i'd take that over AWD center-rear engine.
Like Ferrari in italy, seems to be like Mc queen
Even though you cheated off the line yianni the porsche beat you lol
El Porsche es una Bestia 😈
No chance that Lambo sounds better than the Ferrari sorry Yanni you lost there.. BTW Yanni jumped the 1st start as well. It will be hard to pick between the Porsche and Ferrari but I think the superfast has a larger x-factor, no Tractor for me ;)
You can drive grocery shopping with the Porsche after destroying everything while you’d look like a total douche in the Lambo
812 no.1 then 911 no.2 svj in last
That Aventador looks hideous with it's stickers all over the place. The Ferrari sill looks the best in my eyes but I'd go for the Turbo simply because of the potential that engine still has in it.
Obviously the nicest car and the best is the Porsche, no doubt
Aventador  SVJ anytime anyday
812😍😍😍
Porsche be like. "Bring it On "
SVJ all day
Day 58 of telling Mat that Porsche is actually pronounced Porsch-u not pOrSh
I really like how the Porsche's like showing up all casual and stuff and takes the  victory away from the all flashy bois.
Please please race Porsche GT2 Rs vs 812 superfast on Monday
Porsche
Get some cars to actually challenge the Porsche!  That Porsche is in a different league  💪
Imagine the noise!!!
super fast is the best!
In every aspect the ferrari is a winner. 10/10 would have😅
Porsche
Porsche.
Yanny really has a habit of jumping starts!!! From a stand off Lambo wins, but not by much (considering how heavy the Ferrari is I'd say moral winner is Ferrari). From the rolling start Ferrari wins. Braking obviously Ferrari loses but being that heavy it's still impressive! Sound...well...both are impressive, I'm a Ferrari fan so..  Still, best over all...Porsche, hands down. Better traction, lighter, by far the best deal out of the three.   My pick, Ferrari...but I'm a fan so
Lamborghini SVj
AMG - noise straight line speed - porsche - all rounder nuff said
Porsche
Porsche definitely sounded they best XD
Its clear then HorsePower doesn't matter, Horse does. Well done Pony. (Porsche)
The Porsche has the best sound by far..😂
porsche be like , green hell king don't need to race with these peasant cars 😂😂😂😂
Porsche all day long
Porsche FTW!
We really have to admire Porshe, it is insane for it's price :o
Why’s Yianni so serious 🙄✊🏼
The porches  is the best
Including mclaren 720s would have made this drag race a hell lot more interesting !!!
Who cares who wins. Give me all of those cars, I am not jealous 😎
Ferrari...ALL DAY....EVERYDAY(Yianni Voice)
It is a hard choice between the Lamborghini and Ferrari.
You can't ignore the fact that Porsche is quick. It proves that not always most horsepower wins it's about how the cars puts the power down. It's neither most powerful here nor lightest still beats everyone. That's Porsche for you and it's so much cheaper it's the sleeper supercar❤❤❤👑💯
Porsche sin duda
Race starts at 4:45
He imitating the guys from CARS
I imagine I could daily a Superfast !
Porsche has 4 seats. And is comfortable enough to take the kids to school. Also in my opinion looks the best and the least showy. I'd have the porsche
Porsche is the best looking, fastest all the way up until the two other cars with over 120hp more catch up at around 190mph. This all for a cost that is £100,000 cheaper than the next cheapest car.
Hundy P ... that 911 .... I'd buy two rather than getting that Lambo.
I’ve seen the ace tarot before I literally have pictures of it that I took
Awesome stuff as always
If someone will give me the chance to get one of these cars for free, I will still get the Porsche Turbo S
That Porsche is a beast. #Porsche#1
Would love the porsche THE BEST of 🇩🇪
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
911 turbo s for me.
The Porsche 911 destroyed the two Italian cars
911 turbo s vs gt2Rs
But anyway i would get a Skyline
I love the Ferrari, very nice
The Lambo with a DSG would be very quick
Germany all the way up
Its super fast, brakes very good and it is surely a better daily commuter.  Plus that i can have TWO  911 than having ONE SVJ, and with change i can have a 15 day vacation for free....   Unbeatable!
Lamborghini aventador SVJ
Lamborghini aventador svj
Cardiff where u at wales gang
The Lambo and Ferrari with their loud V12's only showed that they are all fart and no shit. Just by farting louder doesn't mean you're going to shit that well lol.  And we know what the Porsche Believes in ;)
Ferrari all the way!
Now this is why most of people choose to buy porsches
Lamborghini terzo vs evry car
People in the comments: Porsche 911 Turbo won with half the cylinders. German engineering!!   Americans: *laughs in Dodge Demon*
Porsche ❤️
812 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m so torn between the looks on the Ferrari and Lambo but i would actually take the Porshe over both if i’m being honest
ferrari 812
Love this car ... get beaten by the silent Porsche hehexd
Ferrari
This would literally be the best couple of cars to own. Porsche: daily, Ferrari: weekend car, SVJ: track toy
Definitely SVJ......all day every day!😍😍😍
911
I prefer the SVJ ALLLLLLL DAY ALL LIFETIME 🔥
Hahaha,that was a good start🇬🇷🤗🍀
812
Definitely the Porsche cause is the cheapest and manages to keep up to these beasts
The porsche gts Rs has 700Hp and is better for the race
False start from yanni there on the first run
Made in Zuffenhausen💪 German Engineering 😌
Only if porsche didn't had soft limiter I would have porsche 911, instead of lamborghini but no ferrari issues to deal with, its the lamborghini!!
I’m convinced: I’m baying the 911 Turbo S.
Yani sitting forward the way he does shits me....good vids though
Porsche
No
If they are that close with the 911 and the quarter mile for the V12s are the same as the fastest Tesla why do they lose sometimes to the Tesla?
My favorite is the 812 Superfast.
Porsche
As a German I can approve matts German-ish English
I'd get the Porsche over the other 2. Has the more understated "low profile" look but performs better than any of the other showy supercars.
Mat: which is INSANE!  Me: witches insane?
I'm dreaming of the day when they go below 10 sec on the 1/4 mile...
Lambo:- I sound better Ferrari:- I have more power 911 turbo S:- Then why were you both visible in my rear view mirror? *Lambo and ferrari V12 crying sounds*
From now on, no one will ever dare to insult any Porsche
You guys could do an alternative and better Top Gear (one that people would actually like 😀).
Man that 812 is impressive.
Flat 6 beating the almighty V12s 😂
Turbo S
Porsche “quietly” teaching a lesson...
Prolly porche
Ferrari style 🦁 Lambo style 🐯 Porsche style 🦄
No one: Me in Forza horizon: 5:02
FERRARI ALL DAY ANY DAY (stole phrase form Yianni). Would pick 812 over any of these cars.
I m the biggest bmw fan but porsche is also one of my favorite car brands. They are quick and go around the corner- but expensiv 😂
Porsche
this porsche is mentallllll     absolute sickest car on the channel
that lambo clearly sounds best. no question
Okay, Matt. Time to bring 918 spyder vs 911 turbo s
All day Ferrari
Svj all day
I would buy that 911 Turbo S over these two cars anyday It's actually a more practical car Easy to drive Comfortable Not too flashy like lambos But when you need to race, just floor it and bang! Also the newer 2020 model looks sick from the back too  And not to mention, you'll also get to see those sad Yianni type faces while overtaking a lambo 😂
I will take the SVJ.I dont care about the 0-60 time,I only care about that naturally aspirated v12 experience and stunning looks
Imagine what will happen the day that 911 will have 800hp 😱
Porsche 911 Turbo any given day!
Great video Mat  as always, however there is only one position over the line - FIRST, there are no second places :-)
Barking dogs seldom bite explained in detail by Porsche :D
Matt the fastest car was the Bugatti 300 no?
It doesn't matter how many racers there are , Yiannimize only has eyes to beat watson  .  His main objective , beat him..... and all other stuff is not important ...  haha   #bowdownforlessdraggincar :D
I would get the porsche. Because its faster and looks better
If the Ferrari is all wheel drive then I'll pick it but it's rear wheel drive so I'm picking the Porsche
I'd have the silent Porsche
Sound Lamborgini Looks Lamborgini Best car Porsche Overrated car .... well guess ...
Porsche
If you consider that the Lambo has 120 and the Ferrari has 150 hp more than the Porsche, you should expect that they easily leave the Porsche behind.  It would be interesting to see a Dyno-Test of the three cars, I suspect that both Italians have less power than on paper, especially the Lambo
812 u sexy looking beast!
Ferrari looks best and performance is better for 912 no doubt
SVJ is like that perfect supermodel but the 812 is the stunning girl that you actually want to marry.  The Porsche... that's the ugly girl that knows how to cook like a champ and happily does the housework.
Simple answer, turbos and gearbox makes the differences. Go take the ugr tt lambo and drag again
Mat you should have driven the porsche !
At the second time mat cheated off the line.
If the  Lamborghini didn't had that robo gearbox it would won
The intro is jokes😂😂
I would have the 911 I think
812 Superfast vs 488 Pista would be awesome 🔥🔥
Mat should be a cast of fast and furious. Who agrees 👍
I really like how much video there is with the 911 turbo s
Porsche это авто
svj
I'd take the Ferrari please
Porsche... Bang for the bucks.
Ferrari for looks, Lambo for sound, Porsche for everything else !
Money is no object might have them all.. however my money on the Porsche
Porsche
Ferrari won the sound test for me
porsche is the quiet boy but when it comes to doing better,the best one is that boy
The Ferrari 812 superfast sounded the best and i would have bought the Ferrari.  Btw I m a small youtuber  Please subscribe to my YouTube channel
Porsche all day
These challenges proves the point,if you want to go fastest you don't need the loudest,100k or 200k more expensive,pretiest and sexiest,you need 911 Turbo S,that's it,no more arguments
Deutsche stärke 🇩🇪🇩🇪
The beginning...🤣🤣🤣
Yianni is so obnoxious, he's actually put me off lambos completely
Lamborghini is not a drag type of car  it's more of a track car especially the adventador svj the huracan performante spider would dust all of them no trace but the adventador did a good job
I'd have the 911 Turbo.
the ferrari 812. luks better, AND FAST. for now on i will bi a ferrari gay
Yiannie where's the “Lambo all day long”
Porsche turbo s
Lamborghini SVJ has got the 1/4 Drag Race dialed in. That Porsche though and the Ferrari in the rolling race. Each having their own strengths. I’ve have to go economy 😱 and choose the 911.
Fact that the porche won really caught me offguird but I'd still choose the lambo
Alll these cars are kids in front of Dodge Demon boiii
Still i would have the Ferrari. Nothing can match it's class.
A Ferrari , a Vw beetle and an Audi
ferrari superslow
I’d definitely have that 812
That Porsche is some serious beast ...... and technically a better choice😍😍
A tesla Souds like a Monster compared to the Porsche
What the extra six cylinders doing in the Ferrari and Lambo?
Definitely I'll get the Porsche...its a wolf in a sheepskin that can kick ass
😂😂Mat, that was the campest German accent I have ever heard! 😂😂😂
Matt cheated in the second race ahahaha. Way too early off the line
At this point there's no reason to bring those Porsches in 😂 USADA should have a look into them 😂
Porsche, I think the Porsche would suit as an everyday car more than the Ferrari and Lamborghini.
Lambo and Ferrari: We got great revs sound Porsche:🤫 I just win😂🤣 All3️⃣are incredible beautiful vehicles, but I have to pick my dream car Lambo🐃😎
i love porsche and rari, but i would much rather have the 812.
1st) Yanni cheated 2nd)Porsche won him although Yanni cheated 3rd)Although porsche doesnt make sound,it does,makes the performance diference 4rd)Dont underestim8 Porsche,is the only supercar which nobody can copy its exterior look....Because Porsche are the most unique supercars of alltime.This is a fact bro.And is half price of the ferrari and lambo.This is because Porsche spends a hell of money to advertise
The sound from the SVJ is what it is all about! Fantastic. 🔊
The amount of time, money and effort Lamborghini puts into saving every gram of weight from the car... then that sloth of a man turns up to drag race in their car
Matt you have to do a drag race between the dodge demon and that porsche, it would be an awesome video!! Im waitting for that!!
That accents in the beginning was actually pretty damn good
lambo ❤️❤️
Porsche all the way..
Yannis reactions are pure comedy 🤣
Lambo definitely jumped the start
The ones that have soft limiter sounds the worst rlly
Porsche  the best
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
that 911 is brutal, half the cylinders and half the money. i wish there was a 720s in the race as well just to see the difference
I think the Porsche is the best
One of the best vids yet...just cant beat drag races with matt and yani
Hahahaahahha. The winner 🥇 clearly is Porsche. Less expensive and the best car.
The race is only between Ferrari and lambo..
Porsche everyday...nailed those trashy wide boy dinosaurs 😂😂😂 with half the capacity
Sorry guys but check the video again and see how Lambo started earlier !!!
Looks like we need a demon to dethrone the porshce. Bring a dodge demon and race it against the porshce.
Your accent is funny too
Honest truth I love the Ferrari
*Italians:* You can not build a comfortable and daily useable car if you wanna be the fastest.  *Porsche:* Hold my German engineers
Yianni and matt fighting each other with utmost enthusiasm. Meanwhile the porsche: "Just like ze protocols:)"
Porsche remains undefeated...
Any day porsche
Yanni's warm sounds like darude sandstorm
Porsche just a kid but its still a king😎😎
I'd still have the Aventador SVJ for the same reason the starter wore earphones 😁
5:20 Race Start. second race 7:03. Rolling 8:19. 9:34. You're welcome!
I m starting to think that Porsche can take a Bugatti on🧐
Ciao bella ahahah la miglior intro di sempre
When porsche wins 1st rolling race, Naturally aspirated V12's be like " wait a minute it is not supposed to accelerate like that !"
So Lambo and Ferrari were bullying Porche😂😂
Porsche 100%
Imagine If they put turbos on those  V12s  Years later*  Lamborghini Aventador SVJJJ : *Allow us to introduce ourselves*
Love the lambo and Ferrari and never was a fan of the 911; they always look and sound the same but you can’t argue with the results and the price! Porsche with a more open exhaust for me. Pity I could barely afford the exhaust without the car... 😂
Porsche is a proper underdog
Porsche⚘
Porsche Turbo S all day 😂
Use this as a vote for lambo looks best
SVJ🖤
You pair really crease me up 😆
Porche 911
You Brits are Audi fanboys....it would make sense to go for the Porsche. I wonder with such taste how come you're manufacturing that fantastic Aston Martin.
Svj
The Porsche 911 turbo s definitive
Ferrari
It's crazy how the Porsche destroys the other cars with much more HP!🤯
Ferrari is the one I picked
Svj
OF COURDE  BUGATTI
I am going for sure with the Porsche turbo s😜
812 superfast all day
Porsche is the Best Sportcar Ever !
finally porsche driver face LOL
Comparing turbo car to naturally aspirated engines is ridiculous, buying any of these car puts smile on your face and that is all that matters
Lambo all day🎉🎉
Yianni in a race : Thats the level of dedication i want in my life.#BelikeYianni
Race a la Ferrari against the Porsche
Porsche💪💪💪
Venti looks like a cheese wedge and always will look like such. 812 looks elegant but has too much going on design wise, I’d say the conservative design Language (and engineering brute) of the Porsche is dominant. Silent but deadly
Porsche turbos never fail to impress me
Porsche 911 Turbo S
The svj
I would take the 812
How is the porsche so fast
Can you guys make a real race gt2 rs vs svj
Good on you Porsche
every time Yianni launches he looks like he's trying to strangle the car 😂
i would want the porsche
Ferrari always
Need to run this lineup again + McLaren 765LT
buahahaha lambo...
Italians doesn't speak like you think...
SVJ sounded the best, but I thought the Ferrari would. It would be the best with an exhaust though.
812 sounds better than the aventador imo
Place the dodge demon in the drag race
the Porsche Power, that Porsche is seriously Fast!!!!
porsche 911 obvio...
Porsche 918 spyder vs Porsche GT2 RS vs Porsche 911 turbo S
I think The Panamera and The Cayenne stole my heart, always gonna be a Porsche fan.
I'd take the ferrari
Which car out of these 3 will you have ? Well, duh, Porsche 911 turbo S all day long.. why, coz its way cheaper or as I call it value for 💰,  better interior design,  reasonably good outside design too, good quality materials used for its production AND the best out of 3 for any type of 🏁 🏎
The Porsche is a serious force. For all the extra money I’m not sure if the other two are all show and no go. I guess its easy to develop a car that looks amazing and is seriously expensive but not so easy to develop serious performance and engineering relatively efficiently. It makes you wonder what Ferrari and Lambourghini are really doing?!
Wer kommt auch von deinUpdate ?😂
812SF still faster then SF1000
I’d have the 911 as it’s MUCH more reliable and faster and half the price, but money no object I’ll have a Pagani thanks.
That was brilliant... 911Turbo S... a true bargain (in this group). Lamborghini sounds incredible.
Porchee
always lambo
Considering the porsche costs 200,000 less than the svj I think I would have the porsche so I could smoke peoples supercars.
Porsche of course but the heart FERRARI
I would choose Ferrari because it’s elegant and number two because Mat is in that car. Hehehe
Just admit it, there's no one more dedicated than Yianni, He gives it everything he got. 💯 #BeLikeYianni
If the Lambo had a dual clutch gearbox it would have surely beaten the Porsche
damn that porsche  defeated the lambo
Heart says lambo. Head says Porsche.
porsche couldn't have gotten a better advertisement than this.
That Porsche is lit🔥🔥🔥
I would like to have Lambo
Put that Lamborghini in "corsa" mode and see the difference (as well the race mode on the 812)
Porsche is typically german. This is a jewel of a car
Porsche is like a kid in class that is quiet and the Ferrari and the Lamborghini are the bullies.
Yani jumped the line and still lost to the Porsche
no death - no subscription
Turbo all day
I will take the ferarri. I just love the superfast! And all because of gta 5😂
Porsche allday - german engineering at its finest..understated yet pure class.
Porsche Rulezzz 🕶️
nicht so frech
I would have the Ferrari 812 Superfast for sure...
Where’s 720s mc laren
You should not stop a car after repeated full braking from 190 mph. The heat from the brakes goes into the tires.
I easily choose Lamborghini Aventador SVJ❤️👍👍
Yany jumped the start again...
Imagine the Porsche with the same power as the others... it would smash them... German Power 💪🏻💪🏻
Porsche Fanboy, out of the others I’d have the Ferrari
The ferrari is shit like In f1
Lamborghini
Porsche
Carwow is all abour matt vs yianny
That Porsche is a masterpiece!
812+carwow = 1744kg + 60kg = 1804kg SVJ+yanni = 1525kg + 300kg = 1825kg oh that's why 812 won SVJ! SiMpLe MaTh
Yanny red lit the first run so hard
Porsche
Ferrari anyday, the engine alone is unreal.
Give me a Porsche!
Turbos, because we don´t need 6 liters to kick your ass!
Best intro😂😂
Phorsche for sure
bruh how tf does porsche make their 911s so fast
Ferrari 812 Superfast for sure. Might not be the fastest as the name lol but for sure would enjoyed driving it with Naturally Aspirated V12 sounds. And also one of the best looking  V12 ferrari ever. 🔥
Ohh a fake 63 edition thoo
Love to have that Ferrari
Porsche 911 on fire
porsche e best 😍😍😍😍
Porsche all day long!!
Any chance that we will see a 918 on this show paired with a Turbo S and a tunned 720? That would be a hell of a show.
Flat 6 is unbeatable
Looks -SVJ  Sound -SVJ
911 Turbo S is made up of something,
The germans build the best cars on earth
9:04 after couple runs, the lambo tank is already empty??? Whoa
MAYBE YIANNI BEING HEAVY WAS SLOWING THE CAR DOWN
Rari all day
lambo
I like your accent in the starting
Wow, a rear wheel drive Grand Tourer Cheaper Ferrari beat a hard core AWD track version Lamborghini. Just shows how important a good gearbox is.
Ferrari.....My all time fav......
Porsche engineering + Lambo power = Land rocket
Definitely would have a Porsche 100%
812 superfast actually sounded better to me 😅.. Lambo might be louder but not better if you ask me 😅
I'd have the Ferrari
wow awesome European accent, should do an Irish, Scottish and Welsh accent, I can't tell the difference among these 3.
Definitely the Porsche. But if you want more out of life, then Ferrari is definitely the way to go.
Dual Clutch Win
I would take the Porsche for sure
Conclusion: just the turbo on the porsche engine > extra 6 cyl
Porsche all day long. More understated.
I will have the Lamborghini Aventador svj it is my dream car
Again .. the silent German assassin wins 🇩🇪🇩🇪
When the Porsche say goodbye... it's goodbye for this cars 😂😂
The Porsche sounds the fastest. No energy wasted for show.
911  !!!!!!!!!!
Porsche is fast but i love lamborghini
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ all day everyday 💯🏆
Was looking so bad for an 812 in a carwow dragrace
Ferrari
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Porsche: hold my 3.8l flat 6
Victory for the germans ❤️ 🇩🇪 they should change turbo with GT2 RS 😎😎
porsche and lambo are brothers, both owned by VW
So that lambo is going back to Cardiff without winning anything
Matt.. It’s PORSCHE! Not Porsch! C’mon man! 🙄
This is Porsche
Lambo:- I sound better Ferrari:- I have more power 911 turbo S:- kids these days🤦🏻‍♂️😂 *Lambo and ferrari V12 crying sounds*
Audi’s son had no chance against his uncle Porsche
That Lamborghini svj is lovely.😍😍
Please car wow put the dodge demon it will trash these cars
Without watching it I know already the turbo S is gonna win
812 Superfast all day, every day. As fast as both and I can carry all my luggage with me and go on trips. You want a track-focused car, get a 488 Pista.
Lambo sounds the best but I would personally have the Porsche
Porsche 911
I'd take the Ferrari all day
Cant belive it that porsche destroyed them so hard
just because fat guy it lambo....
Ferrari
"Let's talk about the Bull beating the horse."  *Porsche with the horse logo* : "Am I a joke to you?"
Porsche
Porche wins of course
Ferrari:dadatatdatata Lamborghini:bumbumbumnmm Porsche:fuck your special exhaust!
Let’s take the 812 and turbo S for about the same money of the svj 😅
How the hell does Porsche do it with 150 fewer horses from half the cylinders and half the price? That thing is bonkers. It still probably handles better than the Lambo as well, is more comfortable and drivable everyday. Hats off. And, shoot me for saying, better looking than that shouty mess of angles and slashes that is the Lambo, or the deathly sinister presence of the Ferrari.
We need to see a gt2 rs in a drag race against the turbo s
And that lads ‘n gents is what we call German f*cking Engineering
Porsche for life
My Veloster N sounds way better than the Porsche
The Porsche 911 Turbo S Is The Best 🔥
911 all day baby!! 😎👍
911
Is matt watson a gandu?
Best video everrr
I’ll prove my friend wrong with this video.
My uncles neighbour is a motorsports journalist, and had a Porsche 911 Turbo S cabriolet for two weeks. He picked me up in it last saturday, on a sunny day here in Sweden. Aaaaaand holy shit.... I am SERIOUSLY impressed by the car!
イタリア語っぽいのとドイツ語っぽい喋り方すこw
*Imagine this, a car with:* Porsche 992 Turbo S gearbox/drivetrain Lamborghini AWD system McLaren 720s engine and aero
The ferrari 812 superfast is by far the nicest looking car of the three
So the perfect formula for a drag race is out  A pair of turbochargers running on all 4 wheels with a dual clutch transmission paired with a launch control . Just as it is. Forget about the number of cylinders forget about the power figures .
I would have the Porsche.
Yanni casually has a £15,000 Rolex on
Porsche 911 Turbo S
I hate to say that Ferrari rev was Insane. I'd take the lambo though.
I’d have the Porsche !
Did a Porsche just beat a lambo and a Ferrari and it’s the cheapest
Porsche is really killer here. What a technology man. Exceptional launch control and awd.  But always disappointed with lambo, great looking car, aggressive sounding v12s, but still slow in straight up. Though svj is fastest production car in nurburgring . Huracan performante is better than aventador.
2.2 bar With those tyres looks pretty low to me.
Me and Jeremy Clarkson would take the glorified VW Beetle
I would like a Porsche anyday. silent on road, killer when racing. Perfect!
Dodge Demon vs Porsche 911 Turbo S! That would be great!
Porsche all day
What Porsche??  Yianni's fave phrase 😂😂😂 He didn't say that today
Porsche or Ferrari never Lamborghini
I'll have the Porsche please 😁👍
Yani always jumps the start. Always!!
Yiannimize -buys the fastest lambo for 360 000 .... loses Matt lends a Ferrari for 100 000 less.... (I need 25 years to earn that)... and kicks Lambo ass  Porsche.... What the fuck....?! you get payed so much?!?!?!... I dont event try anymore....  Porsche won... Entschuldigung meine freunde, wo ist das Podium?
GT2RS vs TurboS 🙏
German Engineering 😎
yani cheater
This porsche is the ultimate sleeper
I love how much yanni is into the race literally more than mat
0:20 I hate this guy
Ferrari 812 with Novitec exhaust is my choice.
Yanni jumps a lot of starts- keep in mind Mat. He's good content though.
First Race: Lambo early start. Second Race: Ferrari early start. First and Second Race: Porsche win
Damn what did they put in that Porsche it’s crazy
Фуррари) lamborghini top
I’ve always been a Porsche person so I’d take that any day
Porsche
812  KING
No one is even looking at the porsche.... Not even one glance.  Every race against that car is a lost one 😂😂😂
It’s Saturday and Carwow has a bloody good race
This is so dream job
Mallus ady like 👍
What ever happened to polls for the best exhaust 😢
911
A bad mans car porche
I think it wasn’t the right Ferrari to use for this challenge, it would have been better if the used a f8 or sf90 stradale (but I don’t think it’s out now) . The Ferrari is a gt, and it has a front engine so I think it wasn’t the right fit for this video but it still was a very nice video
Super and hyper cars are supposed to be theatrical. The Porsche may be the fastest but it doesn't feel the same as the rest. It's like a Tesla, very fast but you much prefer to show up in either other two.
1000 cars covered in cling film and the money made, still can't buy the quickest car. Poor Yan.
812 SUPERFAST 💥
We need a race between Porsche: Turbo s; GT3RS; GT2RS; 918 Spyder & Tycan Turbo S
I want to see the 488pista
I hope the next generation  Lamborghini can change their gearbox
CarWow Saturday mornings treat 👌 Thank you sir
I really love the looks of the 992
Porsche is the clear winner, especially for the wallet... Comparatively speaking
Porsche every time.
Bhai bhai ... porsche is always father and pls don’t mess with father.
Both the bull and horse feels veeery amature in front of the Porsche.
Porsche is not a car, its a weapon you bring to track to kill your opponents.
Lamborghini lost just because of its single clutch gearbox where as Porsche with its lightning fast gear changes just edging ahead same with Ferrari @Carwow @yiannimize #ferrari #porsche
I would get the SVJ, sell it and get the Porsche and a S-Class
U know Porsche has those extra serious German engineers.
Porsche is that kid in class that makes everytime a 6 and is still not happy.
Ferrari 812 superfast
911 is the best
3:21 U guys noticed watching his own videos🤣🤣 BTW loved the content and have subscribed:)
Would have the Porsche over anything
Porsche the best
Yianny’s in car footage - PURE GOLD!
goosebump when ferrari rev & when porsche launch , 2 my favorite company
I would have the Lampo sell it and buy the porche with weissach exhaust system and package
Damn that intro is gold
l knew a RWD had no chance to win the drag against AWD but when it evens out with lambo at the end... damnm that was impressive, rolling race was humiliation for other two cars, also exhaust sounded better on rari, it's really a beast, and l'd like to see more ferraris on this channel
1 Porsche HP is like 1,25 HP xof any other car.
Porsche is the daddy
My g soloman said ‘ The Porsche is like Khabib, it’s quiet but always delivers. The lambo is like Connor, loud and flashy, just not good enough.
SVJ
Porsche
Allways would Go for The Porsche Turbo S Out of those 3, and out of any car selection for that matter... only hyper cars are different story tho 😆
If Money object then I'd go with the 812SF; with an aftermarket exhaust on the Porsche, it will sound just as good as the other two cars.
I would own the Ferrari if money was no object
Bopidy boopy
Definitely it will be the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ❤️
But the Porsche isn’t the better car. Who would take that over the 2 actual supercars which are both nicer, sound better, look better, are faster, and actually turn head which is the whole point In a super car
Lamborghini and Ferrari has  Better sound then Porsche
Porsche: HALF the engine, HALF the numbers and HALF the price, still WINS IT! German engineering 🇩🇪.
911 all day long. Lambo is too loud visually
Would be awesome if you could get a Koenigsegg Agera RS to race with!
Porches, it's science.
Matts German accent is outstanding
812 superfast and Porsche is not a gt car like ferrari
Now this is why you bring a Porsche Turbo S to the fight!!!! I‘m tired of people always bringing the standard Turbo.  Porsche is a BEAST! But that Ferrari looks so darn good. 😄
Now Thats a drag race. Thanks mat
Damn that Lambo sounds so good🤤
Ferrari and Lamb: look at me! Look at me! Porsche: hold my beer. Pure class.
The conclusion is porsche is the silent killer and the lambos the garbage of the roads.
I'd have the Porsche... first rolling start was unusually long this time round, Porsche still won... and it's the best sounding:)
Porsche💯
'Enough silly accents'  from a Brummie,you make me laugh Matt.
I'll have Porsche...but i think you dhoild add Aston Martin dbs superleggera also in this.
Yanny - COME ON.... OH NO! hahaha
Ferrari 812 superfs
Porsche
Porsche 911 Turbo
The 812 Sounds the best
Ferrari 812 superfast best
Drag race champion
Porsche 911 turbo s : sad to be lonely 😔
812 super fast v12
Word italian is nice on weekends or on holidays.  German is better on workdays..  Less talking,  getting the job done
Please m8 vs aventador sv and aventador SVJ vs sv
I like the Ferrari the most but there is not contest here, I’d have the Porsche without any thoughts. Better GT, can even work as a daily, will be much more reliable and it is also the fastest of the three!
Someone explain to me what’s the difference between;  1) Matt wanting to do impressions of other nationalities 2) Simpsons wanting to use a white American to impersonate an Indian shop keeper .....
The people drive super cars  And me I draw it 😂😂
10.4 sec. for  an atmospheric engine with less torque and RW traction is a sensational result . Porsche is a very good modern machine: 4WD, turbos and a spectacular launch control system. Two different schools, two different ways to deliver the fun. Power = Torque x engine rotation speed.....so the Posche have a plus from standing to 80 mph while the 12 cylinder have more performances at high RPMs ( rollig race). It is all matter of preferences. I like more the sound  and the power delivery of the 12 Cyl.
yani is the lambho guy
Ferrari sounded way better
Porsche: "Another day, another win" Rest: "Oh boy"
German Power!💪😜
That porsche... what.the.fuck.  is that?
Porsche ALL THE WAY>>>> :)
Lamborgini = Audi/VW - Jever, Porsche = VW - Jever, go for real italian cars
The way yanni starts before anyone else it isn't fair 😂😶
The accents !!
Why dont you bring  an old tuned car so it beats the shit out of the new cars? That would be so fun :D  Like those modded drag cars. OLD vs NEW kinda thing?
Porsche is a King no doubt!
I would have the Porshe
Seems so natural that Porche beats all the other cars!
ഹായ് mat watson.,. kollam polichu.... വല്ലൊമ്മ് മനസിലായൊ...
Love the 812. But I'd pick the 911 and buy another car with the price difference!
812 superfast
Just imagine slamming a tinny tiny electric motor on that Turbo S for some instant torque. Nah prolly keep it pure petrol.
Cant wait for the sf90 stradale
Ferrari & Lamborghini laugh at Porsche at the starting line and Porsche laughs at them at the finish line
Ferrari for sure!
Porsche is just mental! Take it personal when somebody tries to make a fun of its 6 cylinders
Porsche is the best and the cheapest by far so you could even modify it for what extra you spend on the others and it would totally obliterate them.
Ferrari
I’d have the lambo to sell it and buy the Porsche and have a couple hundred grand spare
Lambo is German
Porsche on anyday .
How is that Porsche so good at that price? Half the price of the Lambo and still quicker! Amazing engineering
Lamborghini!!! What a soundtrack!!!!
Ferrari 812 best sounding car ronn the channel
ferrari mate
Today I will draw PORSCHE 911 at my channel 🔥
Porsche on the dirty Side of the track
812 superfast so nice
Lambo
Mat uses samsung s20 ultra
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Porsche=The fastest for half the price Ferrari (this one)=The best looking cuz Lambos and Porsches all look the same for decades and decades 0 innovation.
That Porsche is the Daddy Edition.
Svj
Lambo
Porsche over the others anyday
You speak worst Italiano.😁
Please race farrari 430 challange car
I'd take the Lamborghini
911 Turbo s the best
They both lost to a car that was half the price and sounds like a vacuum.
沒看結果直接留言 先猜 turbos > 812 > SVJ But SVJ still my favorite <3
Even though the porshe is the better car i would get the ferrari
That Porsche is an absolutely brilliant car. Plus it's really affordable considering  it's rivals.
the 812 is better than the aventador svj dont @ me.
I want to see a race between the porsche 911 turbo S vs tesla model s performance
911 the best honestly 🔥🔥🔥
Audi r8 vs Porsche 911 turbo s
Porsche for me, simple elegance
Not even seen the race yet, but I know the Porsche murders them all
Sad Ferrari 🐎 getting old year by year I guess 😒
Porsche is the fastest but it lost the 2nd rolling race....it was not even able to beat the svj....whereas the looser of the drag race 812 won....i think in a mile drag race the 812 would won 👍btw i would choose the lambo svj.. Not coz i want to be seen bcoz i appreciate how fast they are even with single clutch + its an emotion fr me which only i can understand 👍
No one is building better cars than Porsche. No one.
Lambo won the sound test lol, just sounds so better 😍😍😍
"I didn't die, which is great" 😂😂😂
Ferrari is the best looking.
My love is farrari and it's the best
The Porsche proved again, it can become a camera vehicle to shoot your drag races from a different angles😆
That porsche is soooo fast, and it's only 156k😂
Bruhh the German accent was really good 😂😂
I would take a 812 n- largo
Porsche all the day understated looking vehicle but wins  👍
Did Yanni just do that thing that sprinters do when they cross the finish line @7:34 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Porsche is the one and only. German engineered perfection:)
Ferrari
Finally we see the starter
That Porsche is insane
Lamborghini is bether
Porsche
1000% ferrari 812 anyday
The amount of ads in these videos is a joke now
ferruccio (Lamborghini) vs enzo (Ferrari) the winner is a draw
SVJ all the time
Love the Italian accent and the Ferrari
It was my first time seeing Yianny drifting
Ferrari
I would own the superfast of course no doubt
Porsche all day.
Surely the Porsche won the sound test
Your accents were spot on  Well done!!
FERRARI all day every day ... :)  rear wheel drive "normal" production car goes as fast as special edition OF THE special edition AVENTADOR ! and then killed it in the roll race !  PLEASE !  GIVE ME THAT !
Nothing beats watching yianni lose 😂
Lambo all day every day.
jami maked big faulstart
I don’t like lambo
Porsche all day every day😂
Svj has great sound 🔊
Porsche all day
Please lambo svj vs lexus Lfa i want know loud of exhaust 😂
But guys don't forget that the horse only has rwd !
100 % lambo sound is the best 😍😍 I think if lambo have turbo will win every drage race why they dont use turbo????
Lambo🇮🇹
Ferrari or Porsche is the goto car
The Ferrari sounds the best to me.
I would have Ferrari or Porsche
911 Turbo is an absolute steal.
Lamborgini is the best sound
italian horse over italian bull anyday
porshe
Not a lambo for sure.
How on Earth that Porsche is soooo good 😱😱😱, with smaller engine, less power , more weight, HOW is this possible !!!!
Porshe is the one to bet on
That Porsche is just in another league!
i'd have the ferrari. lambo would attract way too much attention.
Impressive how easy the Porsche handle all the Challenges just with the half of Cylinders and Money ❤️🇩🇪 Don't mess with German Engineering 💪🏻
Svj
That Ferrari is still faster than their F1car in a straight line
the 812sf is a gt car , you can't compare it to the svj ou Porsche , but if you put an 488 pista or an sf90 Stradale the outcome would be diff
10.1 is fuckin insane fast
That Porsche is ruthlessly efficient. Half the engine compared to the others, still wins.
All those cars nice lol
I'd have the Porche because if you take the others you are stupid. They aren't bad cars but for almost 100k less it beats them XD
obviously i would have  the porshe
Yianni don't like losing it's written all across his face
神回(　＾ω＾)
Did Yanni jump the start in the first run?
“Bull wining a horse” ~ Said yanni not knowing that porsche that won has also a horse, not just ferrari
What's the difference between the normal SVJ and SVJ 63 edition rather than looks?
Porsche quiet killer
All of the car
Ferrari every day
If I lived next door I would prefer the sound of the Porsche. Otherwise the Lamborghini sounds fab.
Lamborghini SVJ, any Day
Porsche...we knew that 🙏🏻
Mclaren 720s
Ferrari ❤️🔥
911
I miss the polls in the video fam, not the same in the comments
When everyone forgets the SVJ is literally #1 on the Nurburgring you know the most famous track for proving a cars abilities
The new Porsche is a stock car, the SVJ is still a factory-tuned Aventador, and the 812 is a development of the F12 Berlinetta and they still fall short. Each car is good in its own way, but the performance of the Porsche is amazing.
They was like "Well I know the 911 is boss so I'm not worried about him.LETS SEE WHO'S SECOND!!!".
Germany good at winning almost everything....except wars.
Amazing
Porsche is the quiet, anonymous guy minding his own business at the pub who beats up everybody when it kicks off.
Ferrari and lambo 🔥🔥🔥 Porsche 💩💩
The svj looks the best
SUP FROM ROTORUA NEW ZEALAND love your channel PLEASE SAY HI TO NEW ZEALAND keep up the awesome effort bros
Best video so far hands down! Wow!!! I love yani as well, you guys are too awesome!! Wow!
812 all day everyday!!!!!
Porsche
Can't stand that Yianni ass,
the lambo shoots flames
So what we learnt there is the cheapest car out the 3 is the fastest 😂😂
This just shows the power of 4wd, the 812 is still impressive af at the starting line, porsche is the king of the road in terms of 1/4 mile races but on the drag strips its still slower than the 720s
Can you please do Turbo S vs AMG GTR
lol yanni is too funny
Porsche
Yianni lol! What a character. Better on Carwow than on his own channel.
WTF the fastest car is the slowest 😂
Ferrari
Lambo
I literally love yianni and mat . They make this channel addictive 😂❤
I would get the Ferrari for the look
SVJ
Porche 918 turbo anyday anytime
Porsche 👍
Mclaren 720s vs svj
His Italian accent is good to be honest
Superfast, please! Unless I need to pay for the maintenance - the Porsche...
Porsche turbo 911 s
This is the 2nd best race after the McLaren 720s and the Lamborghini Aventador!
Mat watson s drag races are way more better than the current and upcoming fast and furious movies for me.
svj any day
Do a drag race with the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ and the Porsche Taycan Turbo.
farri it is my bast car in this south africa
Porsche ... All day .. Any day😍😍😍
The drag race , I was waiting for.😍😍😍
812 for everrr
8:57 angriest downshift ever now confirmed.
great intro! best looking 812, 911, SVJ. Best sound 812
Porsche 911 the Clark Joseph Kent of supercars
911 turbo s
Ferrari is the best!
The Ferrari for me
I swear yanni jumps the start every single time
The Porsche is a Monster but the SVJ is my Favorit
The Porsche obviously won
Ferrari...Ferrari...Ferrari...Monday to Sunday Matt!
Porsche 911 Turbo S  is the absolute craziest car of the year. I don't care if Bugatti or Koenigsegg release a 5000 horsepower car, this is absolute insanity !
- mclaren senna
Porsche is best
porsche
FIAT VS. VW VS. VW
13 min porsche ad
I'll definitely have the Porsche that thingnis a monster
Damn Matt's Italian accent
Porsh = best start
Me to Porshe : This is nice, but i like this🐂
911 is amazing car.
Porsche are the most complete supersports cars available
Porsche, there is no substitute...
Svj  for track not for drag race....
rerun it in the driving rain....
Dude... Germans aren't playing this year.
I would only buy the Porsche turbo S. Good looking car classic and iconic.
Porsche should have camera only on the back.
Porsche ruelz
I’d have the Porsche..ANYDAY Just Wow..actual Car Wow
I'd have myself a Porsche
Matt needs to wear caps more 💪🏽🤣
Lamborgini aventador svj is the best looking car. That ferrari looks like a joker's shoe and the porshe looks like an customized beetle though its a nice car
Svj all day
I think my toyota sounds better than that porsche
As an Italian, I love the way Porsche beats all out  in such a gentle way. What a machine
It's the Lamborghini
Imagine what the future GT2 RS of this 911 generation will be like... :O
I would pick thath ferari
Lambo any day... But will have a porche too... Cos why not 😂
In the first race, Yanni jumped the start, but in the second, Matt did. I call the Lambo is faster.
Definitely I ll a have a prosche
i love gemany's
Porche was like a camera man shooting them from infront
My GoD what a beautiful looking Lamborghini !!😍😍🚀
Much cheaper Porsche destroyed Italian super cars 😂😂😂😂
How the hell can the Porsche be so fast??
Porsche gila sihh, kapasitas mesin paling kecil, jumlah silinder juga paling sedikit tp bisa menang cuyy, sistem launch control-nya sihh mantapp Porsche 👍
4:00 take yer teslas and SHOVE EM UP YER ARSE
Porsche is the best❤️ simple yet brutal
911 best looking car 👌 and th e performance 👏
DRAG RACE A NOBLE
Dont forget that the Porsche is the least aerodynamic, most practical, cheapest Car and has 120hp less then the Lamborghini and 150 then the Ferrari and it still won!
Lamborghini is a beast its a v12 atmospheric
Of course induced engine are better than naturally aspirated engines and are quick iterms of acceleration
Aventador svj
Take soft limiter of Porsche and add a aftermarket exhaust system and it will sound just as good 😊
720s be like: peasants
The Porsche all the wayy
i watch and don't believe porsche wins a second time
FERRARI ALL DAY LONG
Porsche is like iphone.. 🔥 low power than other 2 cars...  but challenge them hardly...  also low price 😍😍👌
Porsche
Come on mclaren p1 vs the Porsche
That Lamborghini has some STUPID amount of down force! It can't win here! But in the track..., Its an other story.
Porsche always
no need too watch porsche by a mile 😉
Love how the porshe just dominated and was still ignored 🤣🤣🤣😭
Svj sounds the best for sure
I’ll have the Ferrari out of all
The 911 is unbelieveable 👌👍
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
If you’re giving it to me free then probably the SVJ but under any other circumstances the Turbo S
Lamborghini hands-down is the best looking car but the Porsche has really outdone itself with this car!
Lamborghini and Ferrari brands will be in trouble soon, especially when they get a pounding like this. Outperformed, outpriced and probably outbuilt by the Porsche. In the flesh that 911 looks menacing too. What a car.
Svj
Ferraris are outdated
Ohhh this porsche  its just amazing
I wonder why the Porsche leaded the way when in comfort mode but was left back when in sport mode locked to 3 ee gear 🤔
The 911 Turbo S driver has the slowest start/reaction twice... And still won twice  911 Turbo S is just pure insanity
dont put the gearbox in "corsa" it's slower than in normal sports mode!.
The person counting "3, 2, 1, go" put her arms down at the same rate every time, she should hold them up for some random time a but like the lights in F1 don't go off at the same rate everytime.. Thus should prevent Yanny and other drivers to jump the start by anticipating like it happend often
Matt Watson Bollocks 😂😂
812 everyday pls
just get the porsche.....
Because of porsche, i now believe in magic..
Lamboooooo
Awh lads that was brilliant drag race was class yanni going nuts hahaha but I pick the SVJ for Sound and Ferrari for looks and ddddzzz german for performance
I would take the 812, because it looks better and more subtle than the svj, and also has that NA v12.
Ferrari
Spoiler=the cheapest car won
That lambo SVJ feels like heavily tuned for track performance rather then straight line drags.
I would take the 911 all day!!
CS Panda   Yianni: That goes like a Panda😂
Yanni went to early first one
Porsche
There is nothing better sounding than a Prancing horse
The 911.
I heard a Porsche was dragracing too?
911 any day
Yianne and all of his stylish watches.... Top stuff bru, show us your collection of watches please
I would take the svj only to sell it and buy two Porsche 😂
This 911 Turbo S is really insane !
The sound of the 812 is like the old F1, definitely will pick the Ferrari 😁 , my next choice is the M8 😁😁😁😁
Porsche
LMFAOOOO tell us the truth how long you've been practicing that accent? it was awesome
The SVJ is the loudest but the pickup of Ferrari is little better    There is no other car
Ferrari 812 Any Day!
Love the Turbo S🤩
REALY the Ferrari is Black and the License plate is Panda?!  RIP Black Panther 😢🖤
Italy make the best car
Porsche
Would choose the 812 e everyday, fantastic machine
Would have loved to see the 720s
The SVJ hasn't set a Nurburgring lap record just for nothing lol😐. I bet any of those couldn't beat the SVJ on track.
Porsche should’ve given them the normal turbo instead of the turbo S .. it would’ve made this a bit more exciting for the italians .. what a piece of proper engineering..
That second race had me at the edge of my seat 😂😂
Yianni jumped the line on the first drag
Your not risking yourself you’re risking someone else’s nice ass superfast
i prefer the porsche's exaust sound
I want a race like this but with mclaren
Try a gtr nismo 2020
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ sounds like a beast!!!!
Why don’t you review some lambosn
Well... As a Ferrari fan... And that V12 Ferrari fan as well.. I would take the 911... But a different colour. And for the money I save, there might be a powerkit availible. See some already bring this Turbo S to 720 horses by software alone.
i would take the lambo al day everyday
That's definitely Yanni's sex face when he drag racing..not a good look!
I would have that Gray think in the the distance you just mentioned.
Porsche of course are you mad
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Porsche the drag king
I'll go with the Ferrari
🔥    P   O   R    S  C   H   E   🔥
We all know that Porsche is going to win, instead of the Porsche use a 720S or a 765LT... We ought to see more of the 765LT in future drag races💪
Yanny is the BEST like PORSCHE
Defenetly the 812 superfast 😍
812 superfast
The big kid Yianni. One false start after another.
I d have the ferrari, rear wheel drive drifts 🤘🏼
FERRARI OVER THE SVJ
Very spicy lineup for the race🔥🔥❤
I would have the Ferrari
The aero on the SVJ slowed it down at high speed of would've bodied this
I had to pause the intro for a second to digest Matt's Italian accent.
I'd have the porsche defo
Porsche fanboy for a reason 💪
I'd rather have that Ferrari. Lambo is cool. But way over styled
Svj from those 3
Would a lighter driver on d Lambo SVJ make any difference??
If you look at the horsepower difference... Than Porsche is really doing well.. engineering is top..give that Porsche 750hp it will smoke both cars..
The Porsche. It’s the best, idk how the Germans do it but bye bye Italians... also, the Porsche 911 has rear wheel turning and hence, a better turning radius. It’s always been a dream car.
Yanimize
I would have porche
I subbed becuase you have 4 R8 as background on your yt channel
I want a dyno run for that 992 turbo S because 650hp is bullshit
U lot make sport cars look SLOW 😂😂
I would buy the Ferrari but shamefully so considering it's almost twice as expensive and worse performing
Porsche #1
Don't underestimate a Porsche with a vacuum cleaner exhaust
911 ofc
I’d take the 812 superfast
Porsche 911 Turbo S if money were no object
I'd take the Porsch all day long
812/gtc4 lusso v12 all day. Love Porsche, but nothing beats the fun of a Ferrari v12.
Race a Bugatti and the Porsche
911 is the best looking
Money no object:  I’ll have the Porsche please 😀👍
812
Obviously the SVJ with some mods of course
Lamborghini SVJ sound better
Gimme the ultimate sleeper car the 911 Turbo S thank you. I can cruise peacefully when I want and whoop that ass in drag races when I want. Just put an exhaust on it with variable valves
Lambo sounds insane
Damn! Porsche's sound sucks!
Can we talk about how the lambo had such a good launch and the Porsche still won
812 superfast and 911 turbo but not the svj
The most lit drag races! Period.
Porsche for me.
Two epic super cars, and a hair drier beatle
I always prefer the Porsche so...
I like your accent 😊😊
porsche 9912 turbo
YIANNI NEEDS TO PUT THE LAMBO IN CORSA MODE
Porche sounded the best!! Change my mind .
Lamborghini is the win for me
owh and Mat... the Porsche sounds the best
🖤🖤 * PORSCHE * 🖤🖤
Svj
Lambo all day
tbh i would take the 812
Porsche is the best car... I was  late to it but I now accept its the best lookin and fastest... DETROIT WHAT
ill have the svj first, if not the porsche, then a civic ek9 not that ferrari...
Lamborghini rev: monster  Ferrari rev: beast  Porsche rev: hairdryer
I would pick d Lamborghini Aventador SVJ anyday everyday!! It just luks so beautiful!!
For me the best is ferrari. Other 2 cars are sport car but ferrari is a gt . With 488 pista ?
Porsche is that nerdy girl that gets overlooked til she let's her hair down lol
Porsche of course
Love the Ferrari 🇮🇹
Aventador looks the best
Id take that 911 turbo anyday .
If I would have a car it would be P. If I would like to have a good looking truck maybe F or L can be fine.
*THE BIG THREE*
Porsche fan Boys ✊🏻💪🏻  Like here!
😂 if that Turbo S has “only” 650hp I’m a giant squid. Definitely closer to 700.
Porsche all day long.
There is NO way in hell that Porsche is 650HP. It keeps pulling strong well into the top end.
812 all day Definitely best looking
Porsche for sure
Love the intro😂😂
That Porsche.... It's so down on power and it just smashes everything! Some piece of engineering that is.
..THAT PORSCHE!.. MOERSKOND!...
If they put the Porsche 911 GT2RS then it would have been even more embarrassing than with the turbo s🤣🤣🤣
What if there is a Dodge Challenger Dragpak then Mat's Expression is *********
Porsche all day, every day.
Anyone know how/why the Porsche seems to smoke all the competition ?
Lamborghini....Italy
porsche sounds the best
This is what i was waiting for....
Cylinders doesn't matter...
Porsche just changed the whole supercar game with 1 model...
This is my favorite Porsche of all time
Lambo SVJ, team Yanni
Comparing a 4wd with RWD... really?
£262k that lost to a £150k Porsche ouch
I had a feeling from the start that the porsche will win..!!!
This duo is just entertaining
911 turbo S all day
812 for a daily with flavour
porsche is the winner......by the way what is your car collection
I would buy svj
The best vídeo! Brazil!
911 only car that truly is an everyday driver.
812 vs 720s
Turbo S is amazing.
Sprechen sie Porsche?
Porsche please 😁👍
Got to be the 812 for me beautiful car
You had a svj on the channel before against the huracan
Lambo all day every day no matter what!
No matter what it’s the Porsche/ Volkswagen always for me 😍😍😘💯
Porsche is the best Lambo is the one you dream of Ferrari is the one you buy by the time you’ll be able to afford any one of these
Yanni jump started in drag race.
The Ferrari sounds way legendary
Love the black Mamba.
Love the black Mamba.
How does the Porsche does that?? This car is super quick
That was a photo finish & the Porsche is phenomenal 😳👍
Porsche its sleeper!!!
they see me riding and chase me...
You dudes need to invest in a higher frame rate cam for the finish line.
Id buy the aventador so i could sell it and get two 911's
I  covet the 911 turbo S more and more everyday
Ferrari
Let your success make the noise
Porsche, can you please rev your car when Mat is asking it ? xD Yanni, time for you to leave Lamborghini mate ...
Wonder what would be different if they were modified
Lambo svj
The lambo jumpstart the first race
Isn’t it quite tragic to see what the Porsche does to these 800 bhp “Supercars”?! Even in a rolling race - where does all that power go?
What's wrong with his voice
Porsche 911 ❤
Svj ❤️❤️
Lamborghini aventador svj is very good car
Sooo.. The VW 911 won against the VW SVJ. Nice xd
Lamborghini all day everyday
Matt actually jumped the secondrace, he moved before the hands started falling.
Lambo all the way!!!
Silly accents? Don't sell yourself short, Mat, you nailed all of them!  :D
Yanny has one goal in his life. That is, beat Mat whatever it costs.
Porsche is the king❤️
Sound the best SLR McLaren.
Even before the vid started i wouldve took the Porsche. Things a beast but that 812 is one thing and one thing only. Sex appeal
Lambo for sure 👍
Time at Nurburgring Porsche 7.17 Lamborghini 6.45 Ferrari 7.27
Not gonna lie.. I would like to choose ferari
Pirelli was right, “Power is nothing without control.”
The Porsche is like Khabib, silent and tasteful but also delivers everytime. The Lamborghini is like Connor McGregor, loud and flashy but just not good enough.
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
3 great cars! Choosing one I take Ferrari :)
Proof that Ferrari  is having a nightmare outside F1 too....
I would have porshe any day just because of very good control nd city drive friendly
Ferrari🥶🥶
This is the shorter version of Ferrari in F1.
Porsche the king of sportscars!!!!! Sheesh, it ain't even the top of the range and it destroys cars twice it's the price!
I would prefer to have the Ferrari 812 Superfast but I’m a Porsche lover.
All day long I would have a blacked out Ferrari 💯💯
Porsche 911 turbo S 🔥🙌🏾
The sexiest 😉😉😉
That porsche is better and cheaper🥰😂😂
Grande Mat 😌🇮🇹
I’d take the Porsche but that 812 sounds insane.
Every time I see a porsche in a drag race I automatically have goose bumps
if I would consider the svj or the 812, I would already have a 911 turbo s.
You sound Jamaican more than italian
I looked at my mobile screen twice to see is that matt speaking in some different language because I just woke up from my sleep and started watching youtube and then jumped right to the comments 😂😅😂 to check with others.
Porsche Baby ❤️
Lambo svj
Real german understatement from Stuttgart !
Ferrari sounds better than a Lamborghini !!! Because it sounds like an F1 car and the sound is very smooth and if straight pipe it your ears will bleed
140k in an hour🤯 that's music video levels of video
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
I love the Porsche, but would buy the 812 😅
812 ❤
MAT should go to Yaniimize headquarters
I think Porsche makes really beautiful classy cars. They have the quiet composure of a sophisticated winner that the Lambos/Ferraris simply just don't have.
Porche 911 turbo
With the carbon ceramic brakes maybe u need to warm up it to have more stop Power 😅
Porsche is the better car and crazy value compared to the other two. But I'd have the Ferrari.
812 ❤️
812 superfast anyday🔥
Porsche sounds the best
That grey punch buggy is awesome!👍💪🤣
Porsche of course.
Lamborghini svj is a winner for me.
Lambo baby
If it is the lap time race no one could catch the Lamborghini
That Porcher anytime anyday 👍🏽, the crazy thing is the Porcher will handle better on the track 🤫👌
Porsche. Lambo is cliché.
☺️ from overly tryhard italian to stitch on the porsche
Wow the porsche is not playing lmao
It Would be very interesting to test the cars with the best times in a racetrack. There we’ll find out the really ultimate supercar; cause In the quarter mile (especially rolling races) RWD is better than AWD.
Lambo SVJ for the win
That darn Porsche.....smh.
Ferrari
Ferarri 812 superfast
I see Yianni, i like/share :)
I'll choose the Ferrari
Porsch Porsche The Best   number one
Its time for the 720s vs Porsche Turbo S
Porsche All Day. Lambo will become a garage queen and the Fuzzy Ferrari will be shared with the mechanic as its value spirals downward.
Your Italian accent is amazing 😂
Porsche is to timid.. It should have the option to open up the exhaust at will
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Porsche all day, everyday.
Umm I will choose any except the Porsche
Aventador w dual clutch gearbox would be interesting. I think single clutch gearbox is its biggest downfall
When are Mat and Yianni going to team up for a YouTube channel?
Lambo SVJ got much powerful engine...bring huracan in it's place n u'll see lambo is the real game
liked because of yianni's head nod ftw
Porcha 911 T S anyday all day! I think the second roll race the porsche driver was delayed, can be that far ahead in auto and loose then in sports mode, doesn't make sense.
I'd take the Porsche, hook it up to a laptop and give it an extra 100 hp and torque. A louder exhaust wouldn't harm as well
Good video. It’s obvious the Lamborghini is the all show and the Porsche is all go and the Ferrari well sounds pretty good.
Porsche the best👋
Those lambos ar so cheaply made, full of cheap plastic everywhere, have huge engine and drives only avarage... And price are insane,I will never ever buy any ferrari or lambo ,better to buy some gtr tune engine and destroy those crap and save a lot of money...
The Porsche is just too quick for the supercars lol.
Svj all day everyday.
Porsche anyway
All people talking about the Porsche and the Lambo, but they forget a couple of things, the Ferrari SF is a GT car, is heavier than the other two and is RWD(disadvantage in drag race) and in the rolling race he kicks the ass of the other two Supercars... great job  from Ferrari! 👏👏
Honestly, Porsche is the best pick, just straight pipe it and it will be even better.
Ferari superfast
There is hardly need of a supercar that can kill the porsche and the only cars which have a chance are the huracan performante and Mclaren 720S
The Porsche Turbo is just a beast
Porsche all day.
I was surprised that the SVJ hung with the Porsche on the first race it might’ve not won be the Porsche didn’t get away easy SVJ gave it a challenge that’s good especially for a single clutch transmission and the 812 walked the turbo s down hard
812 all day
money no object:  1) Porsche 2) Ferrari 3) Lambo (ugliest care out of the 3 imo)
Porsche all day every day man, Porsche is love even it doesn't look good like you but still it's not that bad in looks. i love and Porsche is my choice
Best drag race of the year. Loved how the Porsche beated those flamboyant italian cars, although they sound a lot better and are looking a lot more exotic.
If i buy it myself the Porsche, as a gift the Lambo
Porsche really makes a statement here. It's the attention to detail that makes all the difference. A tech masterpiece in a suit of a German accountant.
Can we talk about the Porsch🤔
Whats a sinphonic Orchestra !!! lovely sound!!
Das ist deutsche Ingenieures Kunst 💪🏼
why does Yanni seem coked up
Porsche ❤️
German Power
I thought the Porsche said "Walker" in reference to Paul Walker 😭
SVJ
Everytime I'm thinking one of these cars will best the Porsche. I'm still waiting for that race. This thing is amazing.
That porsche is insane 🔥🔥🔥
Like : Lamborghini  Comment : Ferrari Yianni “we don’t care about the Porsche”
obviously the Porsche matt it's just need after market exhaust and and then it's a proper hyper car. it's obvious the best among all of you
Porsche sounds like winner, Ferrari and Lamborghini sounds like loosers. I say Porsche sounds best.
I like the ferrari mamamiya the pasta
I think the SF is the best looking and the Lambo the best sounding but if I were buying it would be the Porsche.  It's not exotic at all and sounds bad relative to other performance cars but you save so much money, get a faster car that will be easier to live with and maintain.   Most importantly I'd drive it like an everyday car whereas I would not the SF or Lambo.
Porshe anytime for sure🥰😍💓
The only thing the Porsche 911 Turbo lack is flair.
kinda funny how they dont even talk about the porsche
Porsche any day
That mph screen in the Ferrari so bugged...💩💩
Lamborghini won sound test
We all know who’s sitting in Lambo every time😂
5:04 Yanni’s SVJ sounds like it’s doing an impression of an auctioneer
wow....
Nobody with a brummie accent has ever said '150k is cheap'
Ferrari 812
Porsche🤩🤩🤩
Why Mat never drives the Lamborghini?
Ich liebe die schöne Porsche
Shii Matt was killing them accents 🚫🧢
4:17 That Porsche sounds like my Astra 1.6 diesel, after listening to those other two...
*THATS THE MASTERPİECE*
Lambo sounds the best 💫👑❤
Ferrari GTS vs Lamborghini aventador svj pls
Didn't Yianni just fly back in from Cyprus? Like yesterday? That was fast 😂
812 super fast is my dream car
Svj
ahhhhh! intresting
Why are we watching this when we all know the Porsche is gonna smoke them is every way possible 🥱
in the 2nd rolling race they both jumped the start you can see it clearly that's y Porsche didn't won that one, 2nd rolling race wasn't fair with Porsche
I'll rather have two of that Porsche and still save money left over that Lamborghini👊🏼💎💥 no one can justify the price on such a outdated car. Love the Ferrari, but I think it's to heavy, but I'm impressed buy the drag race despite the car is only rear wheel drive😎🔥
Even if they are not as exclusive AS Lamborghini or Ferrari - Porsche Knows how to build good cars
I would have the Lamborghini even if the other two cars were a lot faster. It's just sooo special!
SVJ
Lambo, numbers aren't everything, passion is.
The Porsche is fantastic value for money in the supercar money stakes, incredible performance by the Turbo S. if it’s money no object I’d still rather have the Lamborghini SVJ.
Me trying to speak in Italian: *pizza, pasta, lasagna...*
The Ferrari is just stunning🔥💥
Lambergini
That Porsche is levels
I'd take the Aventador - sell it - and buy the Porsche and keep the change....
Ferrari all day!!! JUST LOOKS MEAN FROM ALL ANGLES
Good to c yianni back...and lambo is the best looking car out of three
that Lamborghini svj is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥.....
To be honest THE BEST exhaust sound is from LEXUS LFA
ferrari all day every day
Always love to see yannis launch reactions.  XD
German engineering 💪
720S & 765LT: you forgot us
Porsche All day long
Porsche obviously
I'd go for the porche cos it cheap...      And best overall. :p
Another quality drag race!
Aventador SVJ All day Every day
The Ferrari had the best sound 😍
F12
I'd have a lambo, sell the lambo, buy a porsche and bag the extra cash
Italians overrated, Porsche is the best
German engineering at its best.
Who wanna see hypercar drag race
Look forward to when you imitate Swedish dialect sitting in a Koenigsegg 🇸🇪
I will have 812
Looks like Mat chose the wrong horse :)
OMG.....that Porsche is totally insane, pure German engineering
I LOVE THAT FERRARI
Porsche is the one I will choose hahaha just love the frog design unique
This is the first time i saw a svj in this channel
No more italian cars please 😂GERMANS 😍😍😍
Lambo looks absolutely bonkers. So good 🙌 Porsche .... Effing fast that bugger.  Also, can we get the first run time on lambo & Porsche, looked like a tie at 10.1 - 10.2 sec
My brain says Porsche, my heart says Ferrari and I kinda think the Lambo is a bit too much fighter jet
Why does Lamborghini even exist.  Porsche is a beauty though.
less is more this video is the evidence
"Cause it will go viral is i die" HAHAHA  don't die please
Any porsche lovers in the comments
Please do detail review on Mclaren 765l.It has another level spec sheet
Porsche 911 ❤️❤️
Porsche is clearly better than the other two, but that limiter tho ☹️
Svj
Porsche....... Always 🤘
Porsche is insane
AURUS - 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Lamborghini aventerdor svj
hate me guys, lambo and ferrari all show no go, porsche is a porsche no two ways about it
The Ferrari
the Porsche my god what a beautiful car.
And really, who cares about drag race winner??? Ferrari and Lambo are the cars
Porche 911 turbo
Deutsche Ingenieurskunst, ich liebe sie!😍😂
Porsche is definitely better than both of the cars and its the value for money . And sorry yianni the Porsche looks good not better than lambo but looks good
Porsche
Porsche all day every day. Imagine taking the difference in money and adding that to the Porsche.....🤔
Lamborghini all the way!
Would definitely have the Ferrari!
😎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
I would have the Ferrari
Wow many nieces I don't care about the speed I like the car
Mat bring up a Bugatti to beat that Porsche next time 😂
Best sounding drag racing
My mind says Porsche but my heart...very close but the Ferrari by i whisker.
Porsche all day
Two of my favourite cars the Aventador and the. 812
Awesome intro❤️🔥❤️🔥
That Porsche is one fast beast!!!
Ferrari
Yianni proves also really non intelligent people can be rich
The superfast weight is 1630
I would have the Lamborghini just to sell it to buy the Porsche, and enjoy the remaining money ^^
I'm impressed with porsche 🔥
La Turbo S est magique
Porsche 😉
well before the video started I predicted the winner it would be the porsche 911.2 turbo s  Best sounding cars , the loudest is the aventador SVJ and the sweet N A v12 ferrari 823 superfast .
The SVj is so fast car i like
Money no object, all of them!!
Ferrari is the best
Porsche for me introvert would be perfect
Ferrari
Porsche: more weight, less nominal power than the Lambo, still beats it. Half the price. The Aventador is one of the all time best looking cars ever, but I'd take the Porsche always. Also, it's just much better made.
Don't speak Italian like that, please
to have svj to actual buy though turbo s everyday
What kind of mount is that for the Gopro in the Ferrari?
Bmw n 911 one love
In Porsche we trust!
911. The BEST
Ferrari
#porscheforlife ⚡️
I like Ferrari sound
This Drag Race was Ferrari (Mat) vs Lambo (Yianni) meanwhile the Porsche having a blast by itself kicking both their asses xD  Seriously, even if sounds shit compared to the Ferrari and Lambo, that Porsche is a fucking monster on the Drag Strip. Perfect daily driver/race car.
Ferrari 812 rolling race king🥇
Lambo: Jump start @5:23 🤓
For performance 911 turbo s for design 812 superfast
If the lambo had a turbo It’ll probably be the fastest and I would say the only reason they don’t have turbos is because naturally aspirated sounds better tho twin turbos huracans sound good
Ferrari is the best looking but that Porsche is very surprisingly impressive
If money not a concern I'll get the SVJ for the look and sound
SVJ
Porsche rules!!!!
Svj
Svj
Turbo S
0:00 😂
Yanni’s expressions and screening ads 143 Horsepower
About the sound test, there is a saying which fits perfectly... "Empty cans make the most noise" ...
11:33 that gloat of the Porsche guy 😏😏😏
I don’t care how fast those VW’s are in a quarter mile, I’m taking the Ferrari any day👌🏻
Lambo for sure
Money no object i would have the Lamborghini  "Lambo all day every day" -yianny
If I'll be given either a 812 or a SVJ, I'd just sell it and buy a Porsche instead. Porsche 911 Turbo S all day every day.
Lets go ferrari
German accent on point hahahha. Italians and germans wants to know your location watson
911 turbo🔥
That lambo is such a beauty
Did yanni yanni just shifted 12 gears in second race 😂😂
More interested in the rivalry between Yianni and Matt . We all know that Porsche is a spaceship
v6 beating double the displacements,,,my brain hurts
Wtf porshe sound ... This word is só bad
Next GTR Vs SUPRA  Vs NSX LX 570 VS LAND CRUISER The Best Japanese Car😁😁😁
That Porsche damn................... pocket Chiron
I love the way yanni gets so serious during the drag race
PORSHE IS THE BEST EVER
Ill buy the Porsche
Lamborghini svj
911 Turbo yaaa
The respect I have for Porsche...!!!
Porsche, by far!
I like the look of Porsche for the mix retro and modern  designe.. although I'm a rolls Royce fan
ferrari😍
Svj i Love you
I chose Porsche 911 turbo s
Porsche
the Porsche is a fast VW beetle, the SVJ is a peace of art and the 812 is a crapy unreliable Italian car.
Porsche sounded the best 😂
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ.....
Porsche
5:22 I'm sure Yianni jumped the start
Lambo and porsche are really good in accelerating not ferrari cuz its so heavy but if the road was longer superfasr would beat both of them
I'll have the Porsche any day of the week.
Porsche - the silent killer of the supercars!
hi, is mat watson in the comments? ;D
The Porsche DOMINATES!
That's why bill gates is a Porsche lover.
Porsche: kills both silently
Porchse just amazed me, even though I know how capable it is, those things definitely make more than 650hp they claim, typical Germans!
You are the best Mat
i would have the lambo then sell it do i can get a porche and 200k
5:23 Yanni jump started that, freeze frame is evidence
Wow that Porsche is really fast, also 10.4 for a RWD heavy car is awesome on the ferrari
The Porsche
Porsche K R A 👍👍👍👍
I will have Ferrari 812 Superfast..❤️
10:26 did I see Matt pushing the Ferrari door with his foot? 😬 I swear when my gf does it, and I have a Golf...  Shame on you Watt Matson!!!!!
If I have the money. I'll have the Lambo to break all them necks looking at it. And the Porsche for the comfort.
I’m probably the only one here that doesn’t like Ferrari or Lamborghini.  Fugly.
I have been waiting for this race since the turbo s came out
Porsche is a daily driven. Most practical of the three. Cheapest and a better performer in all the aspects. #Respect for Porsche.
Porsche
Lambo all day everyday 😍. Lambo is my dream car
Just as well the Lambo and Ferrari are the better looking cars, as the Porsche driver will be admiring them in the rear view mirror. Porsche is a real road weapon.
Yanni is focused on Math hahahah
No comparison, Ferrari and Lambo all day long
Bit disappointing with that Soft limiter for the Porsche
I'd rather have the ferrari, because it looks better,nd usually people who drive lambos are attention seeking pricks
That 911 is just wicked. Crushes everything
Super fast 🏎
porsche
quickl fact the horse beat the bull considering porche has a horse also on the logo 🤷🏻‍♂️
damn gimme the porsche straight away
I never want one of these cars😅
I would like to own PORSCHE typical german engineering
Yanni had an amazingly quick reaction time in the first drag race.
Matt do it a  drag race with porsche gt2rs vs gt3rs vs 911 turboS.
Looks-Ferrari😍 Sound-Lambo🥰 Everything else-Porsche😂
Rariiiiii!!
Porsche 911 Carrera Turbo S is a SILENT KILLER!
Lambooo
are those porsche`s really stock
Porsche for life!
Lamborghini SVJ
fu** this two...that Porshe it's very quick
Best carwow drag race ever❤️
The Porsche is my easy choice, even at the start of video before all the tests I would have said the Porsche!
Porsche
Money's not an object so please just send all 3 to my address bro
Probably the best and most entertaining drag race car wow has done so far
Ferrari for me, it's the prestige, Lamborghini 2nd and the VW last...
Ferrari 812
The 911 turbo s going to win
Of course porsche❤️
Porsche all day long, best value for money hands down
lets have a drag race between mega cars, buggati chiron pur sport, koenisegg gemera and lamborghini sian🥵🤩
“The Porsche won it”- most common phrase on Carwow this year
Yianni is so happy here i love it 😂
911
911 💪
I would have the Porsche
812 by farr
The 911 the everyday super car
That Porsche sound sooo good
Got to be the porsche. Fastest, Cheapest and wont annoy the neighbours when started up!
Carwow should do a drag race with the Alfa Romeo Quadrofoglio
Porsche is the silent killer
We all know who gonna win 😁🇩🇪
Turbo s is just a monster
(10:27) That moment that Matt opens the Ferrari door with the shoe...
u must do a Drag race of Jaguar F-pace SVR vs Range rover velar SVA vs BMW X3 M vs Mercedes benz GLC 63' S
I will have the 911 turbo if it's a cabriolet
SVJ
Porsche is the best both for looks and performance. Ferrari would be best for thrills and driving pleasure. I've owned both the turbo and the 599. Lamborghini is the poor man's Ferrari.
porsche all the way 🚀
I wonder what car will dethrone the Turbo S in the future. Another Porsche perhaps?
SV-J
I see turbo S, I click.
812 superfast
Should of done all that but with the 720 as well
Lamborghini SVJ sounded the best
Porsche every time perfect all round car
911 every time 😃
Porsche: Siri play Pumped Up Kicks
911 Turbo S if I had to choose, the Aventador is too big, the better Lambo is definitively the Huracan and the Superfast does for sure not have the declared 800 hp.....
If the porsche make sound i take the porsche but i take the lamborghini
so where does the 100 and 200 thousand extra dollars go to  the logo maybe ways the Porsche
Don't mess with the Germans mate. Lol
Obvious Ferrari 812 superfast is the winner
Watching Yianni saying “uh oh” about the gaining ‘rari is my favourite moment ever on this channel
It seems every video is taking longer and longer to get to the drag race...sheesh...soon...10 minutes until the race...we are already at 5.5 min till race! I remember it used to be straight to it...
Svj
That gearbox is a really big letdown in aventador in my opinion
Porsche 👍
911 👌
190 mph without any helmet is very very dangerous even with the safes cars
The porsche 🇩🇪🇩🇪😂😂😂
I’ve replayed that intro about 9 times now.
Porsche Ferrari Piece of junk
~Lambo sounds the best ~Pickup was best for porsche ~And overall the ferrari won the 💓 ~
9 11❤
Damn thats 812 pretty good for RWD. Just like 720s
Rip Black Panther 😢
What was Yanni smoking other than tyres..?! 🤣🤣🤣🙈
Go into slow motion and you can see Yanny jump the start on the first race
Porche was the quietest in the room but the fastest
Porsche 4ever
Porsche undoubtedly
le debut il saoul trop long wesh
911
Porsche
They should bring gt3rs not a 911 turbo s cuz N/A engine can never beat turbo engine’s performance
In the end the Turbo S was the loudest 😂
The Turbo S, duh
The porche is so sick
lamborghini svj  if its porsche its gotta be gt2rs
100% the porsche...**from a porsche fan boy
Id rather have the 812 Superfast. Best looking and best sounding car out of the three
That Ferrari sound so underwhelming.  That porshe doesent rey to sound a lot.   Yanni lets talk about the bull beating the horse  well porshe is a horse.
Porsche is an underestimated brand
tbh ferrari
Porsche, all-day long 👍❤🙈
Would easily take the Porsche!
I love the Aventador, favourite Bull. The Fezza is good and looks second best but I'll take the understated Turbo S...
yianni always jump starts everytime
lambo
Yes but we all know that Porche owners buy Porche  dreaming that it's a Ferrari
Everybody: the lambo will destroy them Porsche: hold mein Weizenbier und Bratwurst!
Ferrari giving me modern mafia vibes. Yes. I choosing. That. Tysm.
Huracan performante vs 812
SVJ
Porsche 👍👊
Yianni jumped the start on the first one.   Second race was better.    Porsche 911 Turbo S FTW though both times! YUUSSSSSSS!!!!!.     That SVJ is the prettiest on the track but I would take that Porsche before the other two.  The SVJ is a close second.  Ferrari... meh.
Porsche
i would have the Porsche
Lambo
𝙿𝙾𝚁𝚂𝙲𝙷𝙴 𝙸𝚂: →𝙵𝙰𝚂𝚃𝙴𝚂𝚃 →𝙲𝙷𝙴𝙰𝙿𝙴𝚂𝚃 →𝙼𝙾𝚁𝙴 𝙿𝚁𝙰𝙲𝚃𝙸𝙲𝙰𝙻   𝙶𝚁𝙴𝙰𝚃
The 911 is unbelieveable
I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I would have the Porsche. Never been a fan until now. Stunning bit of kit at a sensible price and when needed blows everything else away!
What the hell did they feed that Porsche?!
911 turbo Porsche is ripping these tests
Aventador costs lot more than a huracan but huracan is far better ...........what the hell is Lamborghini thinking
When Yianni said Uh-Oh 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
No offence but all that carbon fibre in the Lambo is no good with Yanni's... love handles
7 ads in a 13-minute video? Really?...
Isn't it illegal to drive in strada
Lamborghini aventador SVJ in which “SVJ” is useless.
The Porsche is just fucking BONKERS.
I will pick the Porsche on any day. the lambo is a confusing hybrid. it is a Porsche. But it technically uses a Ferrari engine. I have lost all my respect for FERRARI after seeing how they are treating a 4 time world champion like Sebastian vettel and how they are performing in the 2020 formula 1 season plus the 812 looks like a pig and those vents above the headlamps are really doing my head in.
"We will crush them" lol
Should have brought Mclaren as well
The 812 is considered as a GT in the Model range of Ferrari. That's why it's so heavy. But still would choose it.
Porsche.....
porsche☺️
911 It definitely the better car and the cheaper one !!! It destroyed both super cars !!!
812 all the way!
Id go with the porsche
That Porsche is insanely fast, beats any ferrari apart from the laf
Lambos are just a joke. Looking like a super aggressive (ugly) batmobile but just can't deliver.
I love the humor on this show...it might be your selling point😂😂😂😂
It didn't even sound close to german
I would say the Porsche looks the best.
Porsche for sure
I'm very surprised by the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ. Really. So close against the Porsche Turbo S while the Aventador is an old car and N/A.
I think the Lambo did a 10.3 in the first race.I am just wondering what would have happened if the SVJ had dual clutch. BTW I think if you wanna know which car has better performance you need to take them on a track not in a straight line.
This again reiterates that Porsche makes value-for-money cars that kill off the competition which cost a few times more. It's truly marvelous engineering! Now this begs the question: What are buyers paying for when it comes to those wedged and extremely aerodynamically shaped toys? Just the badge? Ought to feel humbled every time. My guess of the winner even before the video started has been proven right again!
0:15 he sounded like dr. Wells (other dimension) from The Flash
Porsche..🤣🤣🤣🤣....   🤣🤣🤣.. Is not a joke guys.. 🤣🤣
Unlikely to ever have the money but the best all rounder has the Porsche although there is just something about a Ferrari, sounds and looks amazing. If I had the money would probably buy all three haha
SVJ❤️
As great as Porsches are, they all look pretty much the same. Lamborghinis don't do much better either, but they do look way more special to begin with. At least Ferraris all have unique features from one to the next.
Lambo
Porsche all the way🔥
*LAMBOOOOOOOOOOOOO* 🔥🔥🔥🔥
If it was just the looks , I'd go for Ferraris any day any time
Lamboooooooo
Porsche
That Porsche suddenly seems like a steal
For me if I can afford it,  I will choose porsche because it hide their true power with the simple design & I love it
JUST PRONOUNCE THE ‘E’ AT THE END OF PORSCHE FOR GODS SAKE !
Ferrari all the way!
this is what I call a race
I'd have the Ferrari no question, mega fast, na v12, comfortable gt, big boot.
Ferrari best sounding for sure
Porsche
The 911 is the new godzilla
911 turbo s..anyday..
Lambo all day
No softlimiter and some akrapovic exhaust for the porsche please...... what the hell is that
That porshe is a beast...
" Ciao bella " 😂😂
My daddy has 3 Porsches they are extremely fast cars that Porsche made them look silly lol thanks.
Porsche engineering just pure amazing
Ferrari f12 🐎
Lamborghini 😍🤩aventador svj
Awww shoot, when I saw Yianni, I smiled from ear to ear 😊
Great clip.  But please for the love of god CARWOW put the Porsches you test in Sport mode for the sound test.
Porsche is what I’d take anyday🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
The Porsche anyday
Finally the most important drag race of 2020
Porsche 911 Turbo S
The sound of a aventador svj is unmatched
The Ferrari is rear wheel drive but it's still very fast
Porsche hacking smh
I edited my comment so no one knows what I wrote.
With that accent, all the German chicks are yours😅
All three cars are Amazing! But that porsche is just WOW!!! Porsche 911 turbo s everyday!❤️
That Porsche is absolutely rapid! Such an underestimated car!
Definetly SVJ mate , it the most messing look car here. 😭😭❤️❤️
Порше - дешего и сердито)
Yianni jumped the start in the first race? I've seen it a few times in other races as well.
Not ganna lie i would rather have that Porsche give it a full titanium exhaust, a tune, carbon wheels, and other carbon fiber stuff and lowered it. And 720s and other supercar will not have a chance on it.
ok just bring a bugatti  to deal with the porsche  Anyone agrees with me
1st drag race Lambo jumps the start, 2nd drag race Ferrari jumps the start, both races Porsche wins... Nothing further your Honour...
Porsche
fararai 812 super fast
An impressive showing from the Porsche 911.
The 812 sounds better
Porsche: ever heard of silent killer??   Awesome cars🔥🔥🔥
Ferrari
Lamborghini
Even with the slow transmission, Aventador SVJ is the one to have❤️
The Lamborghini went too soon at the start of the first drag race. That wasn’t a good start, it was a false start
The best drag race video in the history of YouTube had so much fun.😂👌
Driving 190mph and sitting and talking like its just another day 🤣
Need a 570 here
Porsche is king of king
Why don't you announce the winner with scores at last.
Porsche лучший best of the best
This episode should be called "Porsche wow"
Porshe is so sleeper .. looks like kind of “ordinary” car, nothing special, but kicks asses of flashy lambo and ferraris
Lambo carrying a serious weight penalty 🤣
Thank you matt, for giving best drag race videos with awesome cars.. Carwow is my favourite youtube channel
Guys the comment matt wrote has less likes than the three replies he wrote 😂
only matt is the type of person to tell a tyre pressure warning to f off
Lamborghini is all about purity. It's the last of its kind and I am proud of it even after losing the match. If I had a choice, LAMBORGHINI  ALL DAY, EVERY DAY !!!
Porsche 😍♥️
Porsche 992 turbo s
Aventador all the way
its all about AWD vs 2WD and dual clutch vs single clutch
Porsche fo sho!
Lamborghini  most expensive  and ugly
V8s best sounding engine v12 sounds like a screaming cat 🙀😜
I have a lot in common with the Lambo and the Ferrari as I too am naturally aspirated 🤣
Cuz honestly I probably kill myself in the Ferrari
Ferrari
Porsche shows what actual engineering means, the smallest engine, heavier than lambo, sharpest braking and eventually the cheapest. Hats off P
1:48 wonder what those numbers mean
It happened is exactly the same the other times, the 911 wins , great Porsche
Porsche sounds the best tbh. Least annoying to the ear.
Porsche
Yannnniiiii🤩
812 for the special thing, and a Porsche Turbo S for the less special thing.  I can't with them Lamborghinis.  Too much man.
"only" 6 cylinders
the Porsche just sounds like air passing lol
suPerfast
Prefer the Ferrari the most, well until there’s a GT2 RS
Ferrari 812
I would personally owned the Lamborghini
Porsche team “let’s make a car that beats everything and looks good doing it”   Also Porsche team “don’t forget to make it sound shit though”
Awesome test... In a perfect world.. Porsche for everyday... Svj for high days and the superfast for a week in the south of France..
Porsche is love!
"half the engine"
Porsche is unreal
That p car spank every  super  car on earth
i would buy the svj, sell it and buy a future porsche gt3 992.
Ese Porsche cumple con la escencia del Nissan Skyline. X menos de la mitad de su valor supera a los deportivos italianos.
12:00 the porsche
My Voting For 911 Turbo S
I think both Ferrari and Lambo sounds great.  But I'm voting for  Ferrari for their sound consistency
As soon as you see Lamborghini in the title, you just know Yianni is in the house 😂💖
Yanni's lambo running out of fuel in the rolling race😌😂😂
Would still have the Ferrari, even with the horrendous v12 Ferrari depreciation, all day long
There's always one more thing to do before the race...
Porsche i would have
That Porsche tho ... wow!
Porsche made a super car killer
if you look closely you can see a porsche is also part of the race
definitely would get the Lambo with money as no object
Aerodynamics. Lightweight v8. Turbo.  Porsche would have won both of them easily on the track . Cant wait for 992 gt3rs and gt2rs to be out soon . Loves to Porsche ♡
Just wait till the Ferrari 812 tdf/gto/MM comes out. It will destroy the lamb 🐑
Porsche Porsche Porsche 😎
ferari
Porshe or ferrari be my choice
A Ferrari is always a Ferrari 🐎
7:16 “come on, oh oh” - yianni
Can we have the McClaren 720 vs Porsche 911 Turbo Vs 812
Characterless German v6twinbturbo
Heavy than lambo, lower price than ferrari and lambo, half cylinder from both, but still can win the race.    I bet the porsche engineers are area51 scientist
“SuperFast” is a dumb name.  Until you say it like a Italian would say then it sounds awesome.  Mat sounded like MARIO. 😂   Money no object, I guess most people will want that crazy Lambo.  I Just want mine in metal flake purple. 😂 or orange.
Ferrari!😊
I like the lambo because it is my dream car
I WOULD HAVE THE LAMBORGHINI MAN THIS IS A MOVING MISSILE WHO WOULDN T LIKE A LAMBORGHINI
Svj
Porsche ist einfach deutsche Qualität. Italiener können keine Autos bauen
Porsche sounds sicklkkkk😂
Porsche
Lambo all day everyday. Like if u agree👇👇
The Porsche is just awesome. Although many of you say „uhh such ugly car”, that’s awesome in my opinion. Yes it could sound better, but the thing is you really can use it as a daily and for long journeys.
They should’ve made a limited run RWD aventador
Porsche❤️
need more videos on your channel mat
Ferrari
@carwow Porsche vs rimac c1
I guess they’re not talking about the Porsche in this whole video 😂 It was just 🐎 vs 🐂
Let’s be real. The Ferrari sounds the best. The lambo is for showing off and the Porsche is just fast
The  german accent killed me😅
The Porsche definetly sounded the best.................................................................................................................................................................................................for my grandad
Id take the porsche any day
Nice start mat😂😂😂
Never underestimate Porsche horepower
That porche was like- You guys do whatever you wanna do, I am going! Bye!!
Svj FTW
Lambo svj
Ferrari sounds better
812 body Svj exhaust Turbo s performance  Definitely my dream supercar
Porsche any day!!
Between them all  I would really like to have Lambo SVJ  Of course Lambo is the best 👆🏿
Porsche is jet fighter
Porsche 911 turbo I would have
That ferrari looks awesome in black.
I'd have the Porsche all day. The Lambo is for self-centered, egomaniac show-offs, so it suits Yanni just fine. Sorry Yanni LOL 🤣🤣🤣 Very entertaining vid guys, well done.
I lik to work with Yianni 😁
Drag race lambo vs buggati
So Porsche beat the Ferrari and Lamborghini which cost more £106,000 & £204,000 respectively.. But ferrari sounds good than Lambo
911 all day everyday.
Porsche was so fast , that others couldn't see it
It might not sound the best but you can’t argue with the results the Porsche can pull off
What are they feeding those porsches
Porshe is porshe
hahaha german technology mate ! Lambo beautiful but always beaten.
Porsche - been my dream car for many many years...just a shame the put like 80K on the base price from year to another
Onam add on matt😂
Ferrari but 911 is better
Porsche for more daily use but Ferrari for the v12 emotions
812 superfast of course
The Lamborghini Aventador svj 😍
Porsche is unnoticed despite winning all races
I would like to buy Porsche
Am I the only person who thought my language settings was jacked in the beginning?
He dipped his head at the line!!😂😂😂💔 Bro I am cryiiing😭💀
Porsche has done mastery on inline(flat) 6 cylinder engines..
Porsche and GTRs are the perfect rivals for each other while everyone else is obsolete.
Mat, we require gt2 rs vs other mastodons including turbo s. This competition has become necessary🙄
I like ferrari
Porsche Episode plssss Gt 2 rs against other
I will have the Lamborghini Svj.
"So what exactly happened" in Italian
yanni jumped the start the first time. Second one was legit
911
Loving the accents at the start haha, but that Porsche though! Saying that the Lambo would turn more heads.
Porsche is a German horse Yianni .. Porsche rules 🔥🔥🤘
You can't say no to Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
911 Turbo S is a beast 🔥
Porsche
The turboS is turbocharged,with just a cheap remap would really smoke the superfast in the roll on drag.
Bella pure a te zì, come butta?🙃
Can we get a 911 GT2 RS vs the Turbo S ?
Ferrari and lamborghini is all bark No bite. The porsche is all bite no bark. Another example that loud exhaust does not make you faster 😂
Lamborghinis are over rated
Half the cost. The fastest. Can be a daily. Well done Porsche.
there is only 63 in the world [Lambo]
The driver of Porsche wasn't good at pickup from starting! I know, how fast 992 is...
Hey mat drag race a Bentley benteyga jeep trackhawk Lamborghini urus
The 812 super fast for me
porsche or anything from VW always wins you should all know that by now. hope they reconsider entering f1
Definitely porsche
Mat drag race a Lamborghini aventador vs a aventador s vs a aventador sv vs a aventador svj 😎
It was only me or any one else noticed that Lambo jump at the line in first drag race!!
и тут Порше лучший))
Three amazing Super car but Porsche would be my first choice.
Porsche looks the best....the classy one
Svj
Man, that Porsche! Insane. Too bad it has literally no sound (even for 6 cylinder).
I'd love to see Matt vs yainni racing no cars just running
That tan thou
Porsche is the best car for the race
I see Lambo, I see Yanny and press like button
911 = beast slayer
That moment when Yianni says "uh oh" he knows that his either going to have a tie or Matt is gon beat him 😂
812
I hate the porsche
Ferrari
Svj amazing looks and sound
Porsche kick ass all expensive italian 😂😂😂. So fun.  Respect Porsche
Aventador Svj - more bhp, less weight, 12 cyl engine! 812 superfast - more bhp, 12 cyl engine. 911 turbo s - way less bhp, around the same weight, JUST 6 CYL!!! Porsche is simply one heck of a feat of engineering. Hats off Porsche!!!
Ferrari want that
I would pick the 812 superfast👌🏻
I need this Porsche in my life😱
SVJ then sell it and get the turbo S and with the change visit ruf or gemballa 🙂
given the prices of those supercars, the turbo s completely obliterates the rest of the market.
11:33 that face the guy made in the porsche after winning xD
Carwow and yiannimize be like "I am the fastest" and Porsche  goes "Here,hold my beer"...😅😂
Far less hp, less cylinders and the Porsche still destroys the other twos. Its not magic, its German Engineering. Im still baffled how they manage stuff like this
Is it me or does it look like yianni always jumps the start lol
You nailed the accents Matt. Well done. Great video.
Yani is the LEGEND... always much love when he is in the video
812 every day! Lambo is too shouty ! Sorry Yianni 🤣
I really like Porsche because you can daily drive it. Who is the one can daily drive Lamb. Or ferrari.
I dare you to do an Indian accent if you get a Tata on, or Japanese in a Toyota
Give me the Porsche
Best. Episode. Ever. 😂👏🏼🤓🍿
Pause at 11:33 and look at tha EVILLLL smile. Huahahaa!
the new 911 Turbo s is the next level of super csrs ❤
I thought yanni and the porsche jumped on the first drag, then on the second mat and yanni did it... Well anyways, I love the lambo but I guess I'd pick Porsche for the full package.
Can you please drag race a Godzilla for once???
Porsche, all day, every day.....................
I love the 812!!! Now i want the full review!
Daha önce hiç 10 saniyeye bu kadar yakınını görmemiştim
Omg svj sounds like a V12 racecar.... Unlike original aventadors
Yianni's expression at the beginning deserves a 100hp more.
Ferrari 812 superfast
Never underestimate the Porsche 911 turbo
That head sprinters lean 😂😂
Lets just appriciate how good porsche is and it isnt even top end supercar
Fantastic The sound of the Lamborghini engine was best.  Ferrari 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
lambo
7:04 looks to the  left, misses  the starter girl by inches on the  right... safety first
I will choose the Porsche Turbo S, most cheapest, faster, comfort
Super Fast no doubt
Porsche : Heh Bacot Kelen !!!
Best sound Porsche
Porche easy choice
Porsche
Lamborghini is the besttt
Am I the only person that loves exhaust with a beast basser sound❤❤💓😛
Anytime i see ferrari cockpit , it feel like something is gna break or go wrong and will pop up. Maybe because i watch rari rebuilds
Porsche = other level
definitley SVJ looks n sounds better
Of course Ferrari
Imagine 720s instead of 911 that would be a crazy race
Is no one gonna mention Yianni's fat jump start?
Insane Mathematics versus Raging Power versus Bella Amore  should be the title 😂😂🏎🏎
Always the Porsche but you should've picked a Porsche Turbo with upgrades like Software, exhaust etc. it would have won any of those Battles maybe instead of Sound!
Porsche the best))))))
Lamborghini sucks man
Ferrari
The porsche sounded the best ofcourse! 😂
Porche is the best and the interior cream one is just wow
For daily i will choose the Porsche 😜
911
The question is why do they charge so much for their cars, after a car half as cheap makes them funny.
Ferrari sounds the best
the accents killed me 😂😂 Very accurate
The intro hahahhaahahhahahhahaha
Lamborghini, Ferrari and Aston Martin DBS 🙂
Porsche
Aventador svj is best looking car in 3 of them
Bro you should do corvette rewew or lambo
812 is a fucking beast!! Shoutout to the F12 predecessor 💪💪
The sound of that Ferrari ❤️
Yianni is so awesome lmao
Fararri i wish I had one.
Porsche is a silent killer.. and matt you are a really bad driver.
812 super fast
Porsche is rhe best ❤️
The Porsche for me.
If i had the money rn one time only, i would get the Porsche because i think i can manage to daily drive it and maintain it with my current income. But for the looks, lambo all the way.
I'd take the Porsche everyday of the week. Ferrari's and Lamborghini's are like lifted trucks for rich dudes with baby dicks. Lol
12:00 Lamborghini if you are  a kid, Ferrari if you are single and Porsche if you are a gentleman
I would have the 812 SF
You don’t care about the Porsche because it’s superior and you can Techart that Turbo S that it looks insane !! Just Porsche domination all day long .... track or drag 💪🏼
what the fuch this 911 is intouchable
for me it would be definitely the Porsche 911. 🔥 It looks soo clean and sporty at the same time, and it’s much cheaper then the both others🤝
Porsche
OMG porsche....If I had the money that's the one😍
Lamborghini aventador svj all time ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Aventador is the best looking car
Yanni cheated the first race, the arms weren't down and he already went
I want the Porsche
Why no one considered that lightest car always wins.
Empty pots sounded more.
Svj
Cheapest, under hp, smallest engine, not the coolest looking won the match. Most underrated car is the true beast
Why don't you get the ferrari tributo ?
Yianni jumped the first race
Porsche is the new king of the streets 👑 it beat Mclaren, Lambo, Ferrari, and the GT-R. Holy shit the new king of the streets! V6 GOD
PORSCHE IS THE KING !!!🐼♥️♥️♥️
Porsche...of course...too easy
812
I would take the 812 superfast I love that car
Porsche : Heh Bacot Kelen !!!
let’s just appreciate a fact that Carwow was uploading a video every day for many days straight. Thank you Mat!
Don't even need to watch the video to know that the 911 turbo S s'gonna win......
Shows you how much faster turbos are then na
Why you always choose cheaper Porsche than the others?! Why don't take a Gt2rs?!
The Porsche and save at least £100k, all day, ANY day ! 💪
Yianni & Mat = the Best 💪💪
As soon as I see a Lambo, I know Yianni is gonna be in the video 🤣
Ferrari
anyday porsche-----safty first -------amazing break-----and the fastest  10.2
You can have all your fancy cars but you can not beat German engineering.
12:08 .....i would have the SVJ
“I WOULD RATHER HAVE THE FERRARI” VOTING BUTTON (HIT LIKE)
Ferrari 812 superfast ❤️❤️❤️
Porsche became cheating. But still love Ferrari
Posh Porsh was the best.
Porsche has a bunch of mad geniuses
CIAO BELLA AHHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHHAHAH
The 992 turbo s is a freakin german masterpiece! I had a drive on one last week, and holy f**k that thing moves when you push the pedal!
the Porsche ...its best comfortable to drive best value for money and mostly the most reliable car
Lamborghini
Porsche sound the best
I would have the Porsche
This is the best most exciting drag race you’ve done so far!!
“I WOULD RATHER HAVE THE LAMBO” VOTING BUTTON (HIT LIKE)
Porsche 911 anytime ... cheaper and better
SVJ!
Porsche
Nice mimic of the accent 😄
Wow fair play to Porsche. What a car !
LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR SVJ is the car anyone would have unless they are BLIND.
Ferrari Sounds better
812 superfast
Matt jumped the second drag and still lost! Poor Matt
The ferarri 812 V
Easiest pich ever. Lamborghini. Yes the new 911turbo is extremly fast but looks and sounds are way way too boring compare to a SVJ. To have the Lambo and drive it on weekend or so is the way for me. Porsche is for everyday use sort of. Acc is soon over for this cars anyway, when electric hypercara are here for real.
Porsche the Best ever
Ooh my god..that turbo S..🔥🔥🔥...i would definitely had Porsche
That ego pushing white car in the middle sounds like an aluminium can farting... And there is a bull sitting in it. Way to small of a can for a giajt bull :o
I love Yianni’s face, he really lives the moment to the limit.
The INTRO😂
“I WOULD RATHER HAVE THE PORSCHE” VOTING BUTTON (HIT LIKE)
Would definitely buy the Porsche cheaper, faster, more luxurious on the inside, and just the best value for money
porsche best sound
Ferrari is the best looking but I'd rather have the porsche as its the best drivers car
I would be buying ferrari 812 superfast
Definetly would go for the ferrari
Porsche says- "do your work in silence ,let your achievements make sound".
The porsche just cooked a lambo that is twice the price....
I don't want to own any of them, so i'd just take whatever is worth most money at the time of collecting, and sell it right away. Fun video. Yianni and you have great on camera chemistry :)
It doesn’t matter who or what they’re racing the rivalry is always between Matt and Yanni lol
Aventador behind just because of its shitty gearbox.
Second race showed that they are more equal when Yanni didn’t jump the start.
Svj looks the best
Porsche of course
God carwow killin it with these drag races lately! Best car channel!
Lmao you nailed those accents
Porsche 911 Turbo - ALL DAY EVERYDAY #yannisssaying
Lamborghini SVJ all day every day
I was routing for the porche so much I love that car
Super happy to have got to see the Starter Girl. She was always a mystery. As for which car would i get, it would be the Lambo the day they put a Dual Clutch Transmission in it. Till then i'll enjoy the Ferrari. But damn. the Lambo sounds great.
Porsche all day
Ferrari
What a brilliant 911... amazing
PORSCHE power 💛
Ferrari 812 suoerfast Harshal
About last question: which car i would choose between those three. As for my dream car i would pick Ferrari, asfor daily driver i would go with Porsche.
Ferrari is really super fast off the line for a rear wheel drive car. Absolutely gorgeous.
See this is what you want to wake up to... Something to watch whilst having breakfast lol
Porsche by pp Performance  800hp
SVJ GANG!,
Porsche 9-1-1... He left everyone hurted.
The porsche is just stupid 🔥
Porsche all day bargain compared to the other two
What an exhaust note on that prancing horse 🐎
Porsche!!!
Bruh that german accent was spot on 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'd get a Lambo to sell it and get a Porsche and the cash.
We all know that porsche will cause some damage...but i have to say, that Lamborghini looks amazing....🙂
Aventador SVJ KING🔥🔥🔥
Porsche 911
Porshe the best!!!!
Yo.... Matt cheated in the second 1/4 mile drag
definitely the Lamborghini❤ To me, this porsche doesn’t look like a super car from any angle😏 I won't be drag racing everday, so it doesn’t matter😂
That Porche is mad
Xin Chào. Việt Nam đây.🤣🤣
Ferrari all day! Great video as usual!!
I still really shocked but yet happy that the Porsche can beat a 2x more of the price than the Porsche. Great engineering Porsche edit: on a drag race
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ
Lamborghini jumped the gun
I like to watch yianni smoked by PORSCHE..because once he said (What porsche)...now look at him he just act like there is no porsche🤣🤣🤣🤣...he only want to race with matt..🤣🤣🤣..but porsche is the king in carwow YET...
Porsche of course
The porsche is a stop nonsense.
I would have Yianni
For all those trying to figure out the better sound...damn that Porsche 911 crushed the not so superfast Ferrari and the 'so called powerful' Lamborghini..
Matt Please Review McLaren 765lt soon
ferrari 812 superfast is the best car
There are so many change of scenes that i lose concept of time in these drag races.. Maybe u should have one seamless take
The Italian accent🤣🤣🤣
I’m impressed by this Porsche which is the best supercar of 2020 by far and better, its cheap 😂😂
Lamborghini aventador svj it is
The German 🇩🇪cars, especially the Porsche, are the best cars in the world.  I Love 🇩🇪
Yianni wins every drag race with his expressions
Deutsche Ingenieurskunst
Ferrari
AVENTADOR is the car which will still look modern and exotic in 2050 , who agrees ?
I'd have the Porsche just to drop Lambo and Ferrari owners' jaws!
SVJ
Cool accents Matt😂😂👌
911 Turbo S for daddy
Like mat wattson speak Italy and Germany in English in funny content. And so all I love Ferrari and Lamborghini and so Porsche 👍👍👍👍👍👍😂😂😂😂🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏎🏎🏎🏎🏎🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆 all best sounding car in drag race.
Porsche.   No doubt
When you see a lambo, you know who it is.
If money was no object the best looking would be the lambo if it wasn’t white and didn’t have stupid numbers on the side. Based off the three cars in the video the Ferrari is 100% the best looking🤷🏼‍♂️
Svj
Svj
The Ferrari sounded way better
"See if it go viral if i die" - Mat's
And the only options will always be Ferrari and Lamborghini for me
Carwow
Please, one review LUCID AIR
whatever happened to vote polls on the sidebar of youtube!
This video will go viral if i die😂😅😂😂
812 still ma favourite
Lambo
Porsche 911 Turbo s .... all day everyday
Porsche NICE!
Just wait till the gt cars start comin again
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ all day!!!!  everyday !!!!
Porsche everyday!!!
Lamborgini svj
Lamborghini sounds the best
Lambo sounds sick
Yianni always leaning forward like some kind of Bicyclist😂😂
812🖤
I am a full lover of Italian vehicles and being born in Italy is an honour for me, Ferrari and lambo are always going to be my first options
please put ALMOST DIED to the title
I'm so in love with that Porsche
Porsche
German Engineeering will never disappoint you 🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪🎖🎖🎖🎖🎖🎖🎖🎖
Actually checked the channel to see if it was the english version at the start because of the accent🤣
Porsche just said "Guys, you do know I'm beating you everytime right?"
Would go for Lamborghini... Hands down
Ferrari, without any shadow of a doubt. Porsche comes second. Lambo is just too yobo. baah
Porsche power 💪💪💪
Mr. Lamborghini guy you redlighted that first race. DQ!!!!!
Ferrari
tbh the SVJ sounds and looks the best out of the 3 for me
The Porsche is the better complete package. If this car could be tuned for more power and torque to match the other cars outputs then God knows how fast it would be.
911 turbo s the silent assassin 🤣😂
2 things.....  Firstly, that Porsche is my absolute dream car 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾  Secondly, the chemistry between Mat and Yanni take these videos to the next level 🙌🏾👍🏾💯👌🏾
Half of the engine  Half of the price  And still won  Wow that Porsche is rapid
One day i want to see drag race Bugatti vs Koenigsegg vs Henessey!
Lambo
please,don't try to speak italian. we don't talk like so
Porsche
That's the difference between you Mat and the Top Gear hots, I dreamed of you getting that spot but maybe you're not really right. Cars are not just about speed. I Clearly remember the "cheap" supercar  episode (shot in Spain I think) in Top Gear where they had a Ferrari which lost every single challenge. At the end of the episode tho when they had to choose a car to keep for themselfs they all choose the Ferrari
I'd have the Porsche, simply because it would be the best real world proposition.
Bro,if you are interested in any luxury cars and not have that much money buy second hand car because when we buy secondth then there will be no road tax,depreciation is high for all luxury cars (eg. an Audi which is worthier 50lacks can be bought after 1 year from a first owner can be up to 20 lacks)
Lambo 💪💪💪
I was shouting my ass off for that Porsche, no matter all these lot were mugging it off for her sound and make it look like it doesn't belong here. That Porsche showed whose boss in that drag race.
That Italian accent quickly turned into a German accent
New race svj vs 720s vs 812
I want to see 720s vs 812
ferrari is good but lamborghini sounds great
Turbo S- beast!!!
992 turbo S ❤❤
진짜 포르쉐 개도랏네...
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️❤️😍❤️😍
It should be the SuperFat
Porsche obviously!
I'll have a Lambo any day.
Id have the Porsche , every time
Real ones know the love between Yianni and his lambos
Porshe sounded the best ..yeah I'm a madlad
That Ferrari is 😍😍
Aventador is a worldwide phenomenon which everybody wants to dream a car as exquisite as that
Read wheel drive, dual clutch and more power meant a win for the ferrari on the rolling races. Let’s not forget the 911. What an amazing vehicle.
Porsche
812 sound ❤️
Definitely the  Porsche 911 Turbo S. 10.2 second 1/4 time is insane!!!!!
I'd have the Ferrari but in red...
The ferrari just because its gonna be worth the most ind 20 years.  the porsche is nice... but its still just a newer 911  Lamborghinis are for people who is still in contact with their inner 12 year old
I will have Porsche and Lambo both 😁 Definitely not the Ferrari. Not the prettiest
best drag race ever
Porsche.
Does anyone else hate the Porsche. Don’t get me wrong it’s good but I hate it
The funny thing is that the Porsche turbo s isn't a super car. It's a normal German sportscar (see also the price tag) and by normal I mean it's still century's ahead of other brands. You should have tested the GT2 RS oder an 918 Spyder...so to sum up: Porsche is (again) the strongest and best car you bring on. Lowest price for the highest performance...German engineering!
Not everything is power and sound 😤
Hahaha finally some accents! Brilliant, loved it. Entertainment again! And who better than Yanni in a lambo in a carwow race! Super video.
British people: posh
Still can’t believe how fast the Porsche is. Absolutely amazing
I would get the SVJ
svj man i mean really
LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR SVJ🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
I love that Porsche more and more everyday
Well u were technically not corsa or ego mode so that’s why the ferrari won that one but the first one ferrari was shit.
Porsche is the best. Just love this 911 Turbo S. Great car. My personal favourite.
The Porsche is just quiet until the day of the race
Out of the 3: 1. Ferrari 2. Porsche 3.Lambo
LAMBORGHINI svj and ferrari those are my favourite and MCLAREN speedtail
When I saw the Lamborghini I immediately thought of Yianni
You should do a drag race betweeen common first cars that new drivers use, for example corsa ltd edition, seat Ibiza fr, Ford Fiesta, all evenly matched with around 100 brake
Porsche is just better, How can IT be so much less expensive and still be so much better with a flat Boxter engine !!
Porsche am i joke to u you guys
You can't go wrong whichever you pick honestly.  In the end its all about preference more than anything else. Their performance stats are just a cherry on top to brag about because as an owner you'll never experience these car's full potential in your hands.  So with that being said, they're all beautiful and great cars, but my preference would be the Aventador SVJ all day everyday.   Now if I was a crazy wealthy multimillionaire, I would buy all three...lol. But seriously from all three my first pick is the Lamborghini, secondly the Ferrari and the Porsche third.
Matt 100% without a doubt cheated off the line on the 2nd drag race.
Do a remap on the 992 turbo and it will destroy every supercars here
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
What a good day when Matt says win a car choose from one of these 3 .... thumbs up 👍 vote Matt gives a chance to win a car for us
The Porsche is my favorite
Porsche PURE LOVE ♥️
Porsche 911 Turso S
You could actually see the Lamborghini being hampered by not having a double clutch gearbox
The porsche is just boring
Porsche any day man most value for mony and bonkers acceleration
Lamborghini
Ferrari
Ferrari sounds great for me. I am Ferrari lover
Use me as upvote for the 911, who absolutely killed the other two at half the price!
what makes the porsche faster tho
There's a replacement for displacement.
Someday the steering’s just gonna come clean off in Yianni’s hands. 😂
Those shifts  by the svj are fuckin brutal
Quite impressed with Aventador's performance It's has lots of aero and that power without turbocharger on awd  Literally if Lambo just start working on turbos that porche got nowhere to hide
With that price, and just flat 6, defeated car that 2x price and made only certain number.. you know limited car not always good.. and that 2020 911 turbo S proof it...   Win drag race 10.2, not the best time (record 10.1) Win rolling race in comfort mode that you will actually use in real life for pass other people in highway Lose in rolling race sport mode maybe because lack of power from flat 6 vs V12 Win brake test  Hmm no offense to other brand *FANBOYS* , but to me that Porche is better value and you can enjoy use it every day
I just don't understand why you are locking every car in 3rd. All cars put their power down differently
Porsche Best car
I think Yanni jumped the start there a bit :D
Ferrari all day long...
I would have that Porsche with 100k of Litchfield tuning on it just to level the field a bit.
My favourite Ferrari 812 Superfast
Sorry, but SVJ just sounds like super vajina
You did really nail the accents.
Mat I have a suggestion of a drag race use the dodge demon against a Lamborghini huracan perfromante
Porsche
Porsche wins almost all. Who's expect it. The quiet power.!!!!
That Porsche tho! Imagine if it was the GT3 RS version.
812 sounds best
Porsche
I would get the svj
812 and svj both have lucus and marcus
배기음빼고 포르쉐가 압승.. 가성비 씹상타치네..
Include a McLaren 720 s spider also  It would be nice
the driver of the lambo pawpaw hahaha
Porsche,ferrari, lambo
Ferrari super shit
911 turbo s vs gt3 rs pls
Yeah, Porsche anyday. Can buy two for the same price as one lambo.
Porche win
The lambo looks great & the ferrari sounds the nicest but if I can afford any of this car I wil get the porsche.
Lambo all day anyday
Porsche 911 Turbo S Yes.
911 without any doubt :)
Lambo 🔥
When talking about aesthetics, I like softer lines, therefor Lambo is the last pick for me, Porsche first and Prancing horse second. :)
This is the current state of Ferrari performance in F1. Disappointing 😕
Porsche is the best all rounder
The Ferrari sounds amazing but does anything come close to the sound of that Aventador?  Btw Porsche proving why it’s the absolute best at everything again, wether it’s track cars, sports cars, SUVs or electric cars
Ferrari sounded the best, hands down!!
Horsepower sells cars, torque wins races... German engineering👍
Next: Enzo ferarri vs mercedes slr mclaren
I'll be pick 911 te cheapest in that video 😄
Ive definitely choose the Porsche❤️
The Porsche is one heck of a car mate
SVJ all day everyday
Would have 1) Ferrari 2) 911 3) Lambo 100%
Porsche is just amazing! This race was very spectacular! 💛
I love Porshe
Definitely Ferrari
911... simples
You gotta love how unassuming that porsche looks/sounds
Wow that Aventador sound is just incredible
Porsche 911 turbo
That Lamborghini soundtrack is mental 👌😳🥺
Let's vote for a Dacia  sandero Vs Ferrari drag race 😂😂
The Ferrari is the best car here, and I’ll tell you why, 1. It’s the heaviest! 2. It’s a front engine car! 3. It’s rear wheel drive! 4. It’s actually comfortable and a grand tourer! Yet this thing can totally hold its own against the other two and actually win! Now that’s what I call epic engineering! And it’s definitely good value compared to the Lamborghini! Also  did I mention N/a V12 all the way!
Porsche, always.
911:좁밥들ㅋ
I will go with Ferrari
Bloody hell that ferrari is FAST the Lamborghini was close but porshas r kinda slow
Its funny The Porsche is Rad!!
Probably the best carwow moment: Mat's face while Yianni is drifting one of best sounding cars ever 5:05
Good eccent🤣🤣🤣😍😍😍
812 all day, if I had to choose.. SVJ looks like a hotwheel car designed by 12yo, Ferrari is way more subtle
None of the cars, just give me the money for the Lambo and I buy myself a nice Rs6 and a house.
Ferrari 812 Superfast
Porsche 💪🏻
Man, what a race! So close in the second drag race. Loved Yianni dipping at the line 😆
8:00 if you slow to 0.25 you can see the air whirling behind the cars wing
Damn that Porsche so understated yet the quickest.
Ferrari
WHY DONT YOU REVIEW ANY LAMBORGHINI ?
PORSCHE ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Where's the McLaren 720S ?!
PORSCHE
Turbo S all day. German horses are bigger, apparently.  Great line up. Not a bad one in the mix actually.
For me the 911 turbo S is the best it's engine is just gorgeous
Porsche is the best...!
Definitely Ferrari 812 SF is the best looking car
Svj for life
i would have the 812 ,ever
The German Camaro.
Who said Lamborghini's are slow
Lambo all day everyday
Porsche always... no doubt about it. Is the car that everyone should be dreaming about.
RIP KING WAKANDA FOREVER 😭😭
SVJ anyday
I would have the svj if money is no matter but if there is a budget then the Porsche
When I saw a Lamborghini I knew Yani was in it.
Porsche looks great and is a supercar killer :p sad fact haha
If that fezza was red it would have one FACT!
Ferrari is name, tradiotion bla bla. But they lost performance and science since ever.
Yani alway press the race padel first than the others.
Don’t get why you’d ruin a Lamborghini with the stickers
Ciao bella!! Matt, I'm curious to see the lamborghini rwd vs laborghini awd, do you think that what lambo says about drag race time is true?
I think the Ferrari V12's sound so much better than the Lamborghini ones. What do you guys think?
Most definitely porche
Ferraii in reddddd😍😍
Yianni is jumped the start
Porsche getting heatsoaked af while chit chatting
When I see a 812 superfast, why the rear diffuser is always unbalanced?
Porsche all day, every day!!!
I would have the Porsche
German engineers be laughing again
Hitting that rev limiter like a champ.. poor lambo
omfg that porsche 😮
Yianni: "Bull beats the horse"  Porsche - Am I a joke to you?
I would like to have Porsche ( actually Porsche taycan turbo S)
AUDI ETRON SPORTBACK REVIEW
The Finest - Porsche !
Porsche 911 turbo s as it is cheap and maybe I will be able to buy it😎✌️
Porsche all day everyday ✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️
lambo all day every day !!
I would still pick the ferrari tho
German cars are the best. i would go with Porsche any day.
Who else thinks carwows budget has increased dramatically
Porsche is Silent Killer
Crazy thing is, the guy driving the Porsche didn't even have great reaction time. Yet & still it won virtually everything. Sublime engineering feat.
Deutschland, deutsche autos 🚘
German horses, the best kind of horses
I would definitely have the Porsche
Aven best, this porsche total trash, smal ugly bettle 911, shoping car 🤮 its normal  is faster
Ferrari f12
That Porsche heysh.  How do they do it? Small engine size  Less Horsepower  Less torque   Yet it smokes them all Wtf?
Omg hahahahahahahahahaha you killed me with the porsche.  I am from germany and I know how they speak englisch
Porsche is a perfect sleeper car
porsche
This porsche 911 is destroying anyone who comes across it
100% Porsche
Yianni jumped the first start
Porsche
Porsche is the better car you said it all
Yanni jumped the start so hard it still lost
Porsche 😁👍
812 superfast
812 SF is the best looking imo
PORSCHE ALL THE WAAAYY
Personally i would like the Porsche because it is pretty good at almost everything and it has a low price compered to the other 2 cars
So basically two Turbo S'' are still cheaper than an SVJ
Do a dodge demon vs a Porsche 911 turbo s     That would be awesome 🤩🤯
yianni just acts like a 10 year old and i love it
Svj is the one I would like to have
Ferrari
Besides the fact that the turbo s is in a different league, the 812 and SVJ would’ve just given the 720s a run for its money
svj looks the best, but i would buy the porsche w that exact setup (colour and tyres).
I think the Porsche sounds best
Conclusion:The Germans beat the Italians😂
Ferrari, but in RED ❤️
Would love to see the diff on a track
Think I'd take the Ferrari. Fewer people touching it, taking pics with it and probably easier to live with!
I guess Lamborghini will 1st and Porsche 2 Ferrari last. Because it’s common sense Lamborghini all wheel drive will drag race fast.  However a Tesla drag race even faster
Please race the 911 with McLaren Senna or 720 S. I just wanna see something🤔
Would have the 911 Turbo S, no doubt.
even thoe porsche is a winner in this test i would buy ferrari and lambo
Porsche has turbo, ferrari and lambo don't need it... Turbo is like cheating
911...!
Ferrari sounded better and i will have the ferrari anyday
So guess what..................yanni the fanny did it AGAIN, ANOTHER jump start 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ferrari 812 superfast
Should do this again with a mclaren present aswell
I mean you have to talk about that Porsche's performances ! That shows that Ferrari and Lamborghini are way overpriced. I will still pick the 812 by the way :p
Even though that Lambo was faster at the start in the drag race, it was still a bit slower than the Porsche. What a monster those Germans have built!
Imagine beeing crashed by a small 3 liter boxer engine. Italians just can't build proper engines. @ferrariF1team.
812 superfast sounds the best
Porsch best sound
That Porsche obliterated every car in that line.
Do a gt2rs vs turbo s
1 porsche 🎆 2 lambo 3 ferrari 😁😎💪💪😉
That Ferrari it’s a goddam work of art in looks the 911 is a work of art in engineering that lambo is for kids that never fully grew up and never want to become adults
Am Walter and I own that Porsche😉
The best drag race ever on Carwow!
Of course the 812 super fast 🏎🏎🏎🏎
That can't be only 650 PS
Va bene !
We all know if you die in a porsche you go straight to heaven 😂😂😂 (jokes)
Lamborghini SVJ 63
Taycan Turbo S: silently watching from afar
Hats off to Porsche's engineers for everything they have done in creating that turbo S, probably the best car in the world right now cause everything is fitting perfectly to give you the best performance possible.That shit is blaming fast 👍
100% the Porsche
Sorry yianni, that bull doesn't want to be drive by you
Ferrari is not longer Ferrari. New King Porsche.
Porsche 992 turbo S
Porsche 911. Definitely.
review that 812 mat
German engineering at its finest
Why we didn't see the Porsche from inside? Only the two penguins in Ferrari and Lamborghini?
I never thought of a porsche to beat Lambo
911 all day everyday
Only 700hp
Ferrari: Superfast Porscher: Faster superfast.
are people still going to say the 911 turbo isn’t a super car?
I would have the Lamborghini SVJ
911 All Day 🚀🚀🚀
Porsche all the way
How does the Porsche do that🙆‍♂️
Porsche 👌
911
Money out of the question - Lambo all day   Best to drive daily definitely the Ferrari.   As a car Porchse at that price is just lethal
Your accent was amazing, German was the best😂
I would buy the ferrari just bcz of the brand image 😍 and i love ferrari s in general
Ferrari is sexey 🔥🔥🔥🔥
The 720s is still the fastest car. I wish it were there.
I first thought SVJ will win as more lighter and power but the porsche .... Oooh Man its just great if I would buy I'll go for 911 turboS as it is cheaper and more torquer and powerful in real world
Porsche is the one
Porsche just always outdoing everyone like The Stig. The carwow stig
Definitely Porsche
Definitely the 911 Turbo S...🔥
Ferrari 812 all the way
Svj
Definitely the Porsche for me
0:14 Dude, the 911 is from Germany, not Sweden 😂😉
meanwhile the 6 cylinder won what a time to be alive
Nahh I’d have the Porsche any day - cheap, fastest etc etc.
911 vs tesla I thing that was a derby
Yanni absolutely jump started on the first race🤣🤣
Lambo allday anyday !!!🥰
The Lambo is loud both in sound, optics and price, and looses against a Porsche that is less than half the price :D   The Porsche is the gentleman that delivers on point, and I think the best looking.
7:02 Yianni lost the start  He could have beat the Ferrari easily like he did in first race
812 vs 720s
Svj for me no other car has the theater a lambo has
without looking the video I am 100% sure 911 is the fastest
What a great Porsche add.
Lambo❣️
The Porsche is King!
If was a giveaway, I would go for Lambo. Then, simply sell it and get two Porsches. :D
Never the Ferrari
The porsche came out nowhere,, and then flies.
This once again shows how Porsche sets new performance benchmarks
Imagine paying 200k more just to lose
Porsche 🔥🔥🔥🔥
How come there is no 720s in this race
911 turbo s
闫妮love you 他都不看保时捷的 就盯着你看
Can you Test the rimac 2
..Less noise..less talk..only Winning...porsche🔥🔥🔥🚔..
Sound: both italians tie
We need that intro EVERY VIDEO!!!
Porsche for sure
8:51 look at the ferrari’s speedometer, it reminds me 50th-60th’ car cable speedometers with twitches when arrow doesn’t keeping up with real speed
That 911 is insane ! It crushes all its opponents in the 1/4 mile race
FOR 1 WEEK  THE LAMBO FOR 1 YEAR  F 812  FOR A LIFE  911 TURBO 'S ! 😍 Thanks  car wow  for this amazing drag race !!! I'm a big fan  !
I’d definitely go for Porsche 911 Turbo, value for money & is simply beautifully designed
Lamborghini jumped the gun on the first race.
In Germany we say: Porsche horsepower count double
Hey Matt switch to the McLaren 765LT and you will smoke everything
Glad to have Yianni back behind the steering wheel. Drag races including Lambos but without Yianni should be forbidden ;-)
Porsche is the best.
That Porsche is just the business
What Porsche ?
That mode was not been made for Lamborghini
That Ferrari has all the top end.
As i m german: 1st: Porsche, 2nd: Lamborghini, because its an Audi :D , 3rd: ... hmmm... how about a Ford Mustang because its cheap and great ?
That Italian and German intro was hilarious!
yanny 100% jumped the start Porsche got perfect start, go at 0.25 speed and look yourself
I would have the Lambo because it's the most expensive. Then I'd sell it, buy a Mclaren 675LT, and pocket £200,000.
🤣 love the accents Mat 🤣 great race !!!
SVJ looks the best!
Porsche's PDK and gear mapping is the best out there period.However for sheer smiles and hooliganism, the 6 liter V12's are on a different echelon!
Now that’s what I call german engineering wow
Ferrari all day, everyday..
Only 150000€ huh
I would like to have the porche
I now it' s close to impossible, but please try to get 918 spyder to challenge turbo S.
Ferrari rules
Lamborghini SVJ sounded the best
Lamborghini is always the best
Best sounding is my choice
SVJ
Porsche 911 turbo S is father of all cars!!!
That porche is a beast and its also 650 hp 🤯
The Ferrari is the most beautiful but the Porsche would come close in a different colour, imo. Thx 4 great fun race 👍🏻
Matt Watson is on another level 💥💥💥💥
Ferrari sounded the best
Ferrari alll day, the others are nice
All talk and no go. The Porsche owned both.
If ferrai had 4 wheel drive then it would have killed that lambo
Please: Porsch-Eh not Porsch
Lamborghini cost as twice as Porsche.......
Look at that voice that Matt did it Italian vs German  Wich do you think did he the best?
I would take the Lamborghini sell it buy a Porche and the Ferrari. :)
I've never seen a Ferrari win a race on carwow. Very surprising.
7:25 "get frou"
looks like that porsche is always driven by a robot in every race
Porshce , german still the best
Get Rimac C2 And Destroy Turbo S I Just Want To See Porsche Destroyed
It looks like the Lamborghini is weighed down by Yianni's weight
After a slight modification (just remapping) to Porsche, then others would dissappear on the mirror.
Get a rimac c_two and drag race it with these 3 cars
Is it me or Yanni anticipated the start on the first drag race?
Oh, Yianni's in it again..... downvote....
Porsche Turbo S
I love the Porsche performance but that Ferrari is sexy as hell.
SVJ
the Lamborghini sound so loud
Matt Watson is the best
personally its embarassing a 160k porsche beats your almost 400 THOUSAND AVENTADOR Shame on lambo the aventador looks faster than it is hahah ill go for the porsche (on the 1/4 mile)
porsche is one quite classy car
Bring the GT2 RS and do a drag race with it
LibertyHell Nissan Gtr v Ferrari 812 super fast v Lamborghini SVJ
I would love to own a ferrari than a lambo any day  I think ferrari is better all day any day
All I gotta say is....I'm getting the rari 👌😂
Matt looks HOT in a hat🤯 wear them more often. Yianni as always looked HOT👍🏼
Even tho the Ferrari is kinda slow I’d still have it over the others
Finally, an SVJ!!
812 for life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lambo’s look great but a little off the money when it comes to performing. The only way they can win is if the competition are also driving Lamborghinis
still ferrari is ferrari
Porsche！
“You know germans always make good stuff” -Vince Offer
I would definitely have Porsche 😁😍
I would love to have that Porsche
Was no question which car will win the race but that 812 sounds just glorious 😍
Defo the ferrari superfast
Turbo s
Petition: make more polls!!! 1 like = 1 vote
I’d take the SVJ
I have this theory that German manufacturers understate their power and Italian manufacturers overstate theirs.
I would  have the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ just for the way it looks.. but that Porsche  is a serious performance car..
Yall fighting over supercars that are worth 150k+ when an rs7 stage 3 can dust all of you.
812
Lambo jumped the gun.
The Porsche without hesitation. A true daily super car.
812, Turbo S then SVJ for me
Svj
Porsche.. There is no alternate..
Lol, Idk why people think that in Italy we all speak like SuperMario 🤣🤣🤣
I would love to have all three cars! Why choose 🤷‍♂️
Matt, when are we going to see a GT2 take down the Turbo S?
yanni cheats every time...
If i had the capability, i would have definetly bought the ferrari 812 out of these 3🙏🏻
Hypercars please
I whoed have the svj
911, GTR, Corvette are supercar slayers
You want to get rich with all you adds
The Porsche sounded better. Dislike my comment
Turbo s
the SVJ can kill mclearen 720s
Should’ve made it mclaren vs svj vs superfast
You did sound bit like Italian and German. Don't be so disappointed.
Please bring dodge demon to this races
If I was in a drag race I'd take the porsche. On a track I'd take the Lambo. If I had to own one I'd take the Ferrari.
4WD gives the lambo and the Porsche amazing launch which is a strong weapon. I'd still go for the best sounding one in my opinion A.K.A the ferrari
Can you ever do a race where one of you doesn't jump the start!!?  Lambo jumped 1st race, Ferrari jumped 2nd race.  Lol. Funniest part is the Porsche won both.
Lets just appreciate that intro😂😂
911 Turbo S by a mile
A Porsch against a Lamborghin against a Ferrar...
Tip from mat if you want to win  a drag race you should ware a hat  the reson is Aero dynamic
Lambo is waste of money.
Svj for its rarity but if its not svj then definitely Ferrari.
I would love to see a dragrace between the McLaren 765lt and the Porsche 911 Turbo S🔥
I want to see this badass cars against a real street predator.. GT-R Alpha or maybe a GT-R Total concept car 😏.  Come on MAT you can negotiate it!!
Gotta be that stealth looking devil ferrari
You'd have to have the SVJ, just for the occasion! But in the real world that Porsche is the ultimate daily driver!
5:20 lets not beat around the bush
Porsche sounds the best.    Signed: Your HOA President.
Lambo
I thing the lambo and ferrari is same sound  but because lambo has flame so  1.lambo 2.ferrari 3.porsche
Porsche really are the best
now immagine porsche put a bigger engine in their car.  its just mind blowing.
The svj is the best
One of tyre pressures out by 0.1 bar hence message. And finally we find out who girl is who starts the races. 👌
Porsche sounded the best....
Lamborghini looks the best
Nice
I would have the Porsche 😊
Lambo evey day
Can I have the Ferrari please cheers mate
Lambo SVJ
Lambo
The Quarter mile stats of that SVJ is actually quicker than the Huracan Performante!!.... I’d love to see a race like that with the McLaren 720s in it too!!!
Porsche all day long!
You know that Yanny jumps the start EVERY TIME, don't you ?
heading to the Porsche dealer right away.......
Can we just talk about the CHEAPEST car winning
SVJ vs Performante vs Mc 720S ?
Tell me, is there anyone on the Internet with more happiness in a car then yianni???
7.15 Yianni:" Come on! oh oh!" Ferrari  passing by Lambo! "Almost" Definitely I would choose a Ferrari 812 💜
Porsche 911 Turbo S
Cant wait for Tesla Roadster with thrusters 😂
0:01 🤣👌
I'd like that ferrari 24/7 of life
Porsche 918 ss ❤️🔥
Porsche 911 turbo s❤❤❤
Porsche cuz it shows on the track
Ufff....The Porsche...❤❤❤
Porches really be doing the numbers low-key
I would have that ferrari 812 superfast
That shriking Aventador is liiitt
If the lambo has a dual clutch
Imagine if that Ferrari was 4wd
this is one of my favourite drag race yet
ferrari sounded best for me
Never seen a race all about 2nd and 3rd place cars !
Lambo 👀
Lambo all day every day mate!
Svj looks better than others
Unless you have a 9 sec car, nothings beatin that 911
Ya'll gotta watch this..  https://youtu.be/KxfjiAtIf0U
How 650hp can destroy a 770hp 😂
Can you not mention the car prices in the video and instead have them written in the description, please? Bit tasteless and vulgar. Besides, years down the line, those won’t be the same prices so rather pointless reference for those watching your videos then.
Svg 100% sure
Porsche Fans Like Here
The only time a Lamborghini wins is if all the other competitors are Lamborghinis.  Has to be the most overrated car going around. Look great bu a little off the money when
Porsche and Lamborghini is like that two kid that always competing with each other
Ofc would have the Porsche
I would be going for a Porsche as it's cheap also
Porsche all the way
Will take porche and save the money
Cant wait to see GT3RS even GT2RS in 992 version
The Porsche is the Phantom Menace!
I wonder if a tuned turbo s would break that 10 second barrier 😉
I get happy when I see Yianni, such a fun dude
Superfast
Ferrari
what damage can GT2RS do to those sad animals?
Porsche had the best soun
The 911 is just indestructible!
Yianni doesn't cares even if he is second last as long as he is beating Matt.
If the lambo had a dual clutch and lighter it would of beaten the porshe
Ferrari gt the looks, porshe got the performance
Bull crushed by two horses
812
Your Italian and Germans accents are on point. 😂😂😂😂😂👌🏾
Porsche
So if you cant decide if you want a Lambo or Ferrari, just get a Porsche then right?
Porsche the German boring Worker!  LAMBO the Douchbag! And the Ferrari is just❤🖤
Lambo sounds best, would own the Porsche
That porsche though.  No drama required, just does the job goes home and puts its feet up 👍
I don't know if you are proud...but that accent of each language was🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ferrari- I have 800 bhp V12..with black wheels and yellow callipers, Lamborghini-I have 770 bhp V12 with screaming exhaust and big wings.. Porsche- I’m Porsche....
812 superfast all the way
You buy the Porsche with your head, the Ferrari with your heart, and the lamborghini with your other head
Turbo S all day... I would genuinely be embarrassed to drive the others.
Porsche all day long. For me Lambos are a just not at the races.
Porsche
Pretty sure Yianni jumped the first drag race & the second rolling race
812
As a kid I always dreamed about Lambos and Rarris but now as an adult I realize that Porches are where it’s at. Those Germans turned a beetle into a super car slayer.
The Porsche is like a daily that is secretly  a race car
Lambo acceleration was best because of all wheel drive. Who agree?
Porsche 992 turbo s💪
I want rimak!!!!
There is no way that the Porsche only has 650hp
I would have the porsche
Svj the best . Porsche is crappy
I’d take one Ferrari  sell it and buy two porches
whos that grey lookin space ship?
The fact that the GT ferrari is as fast as the fastest mid engine lightweight 4 wheeldrive supercar lambo us kinda embarrising in itself...
For the first time in his videos the last car in row didn’t actually finish last😂😂
ONLY 156,000 POUNDS HAHAHAHA
If Richard Hammond can survive his fatal crashes, Matt, you should be... in theory, be okay. You need to have him drag race one of these days with you guys.
Aventi looks the bestttttt
Porsche
Love svj❤❤
Ferrari has the best looks
Should have thrown in a 720. I hope one day we'll see a 765lt, 488pista and the 911turboS
Just image the Porsche Turbo S with Stage 1 :D
Not a suprise, Ferrari breaking
Maths: LHS=RHS Carwow: Yianni=Lamborghini
10:07 brakes brakes.....brakes!  Porsche be like i'm gonna win this!!!
812 superfast anydayyyyy
Dreffo Porsche 911 turbo S
I'd have the 911 but if i could then i would choose the lambo and sell it so i can buy 3 more porsche
I would have the porsche
Let's challenge Matt to do accent from which country the car he was on for the entire video.  E.g  Tesla = Matt must do American accent for the entire video Porsche = Matt must do German accent for the entire video
this is probably the best sounding race in your channel
Porsche man they are just awesome
We want bugatii. Koenigsegg. Pagani.
Ferrari
Porsche 992 Turbo S
This is really exciting stuff. I’m sitting here holding my breath nearing the finish line🤪 great content
The Ferrari
Porsche 911 turbo s was always going to be the better car
Porsche might be extremely quiet but its performance and achievements are loud.
Lamborghini all the way
i would buy Porsche and do performance mod
Porsche 911 Turbo S is the best
SVJ any day...
Porsche is an Art of engineering world
That porsche is f*ckin Fast 💨
lambo
Porsche all day it’s all round the best and if a lambo or a Ferrari pull next to you at the lights they might think it’s a cheap ass car but I’ll just smoke them 😂
Porsche. Handsdown. With a Porsche you can actually drive normally, if you choose to.
Money no object I would still take zeGerman.
F12 :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D
I'd have that 911 over the other two any day of the week!
Turbo S.
that porsche is no joke man, 650 hp only
I would have the lamborghini aventador svj because it's my dream car.
That 911 is serious, but I definetly would buy the 812!
Literally could not click fast enough...  I'm writing this b4 I watch hoping the 812 wins.
I just love his humour
Ferrari jumped the second dig race for sure lol
Of course Porsche
Only Porsche!!!!
Don’t even need to watch this
Svj!
Sorry the Ferrari had wrong tire pressure.  2.55 should be
#porsche
The composed Stuttgart
Lambos are waste of money
YᏆᎪNᏆ
Porsche Driver :- Silent Killerrrr🔥🔥
812 for me 😍
Lambo is probably my last pick overall. I like the Porsche's performance and price, the Ferrari looks incredible. Lambo feels a little outdated perhaps.
Great machine the Porsche, has eaten the others .
In Austria the Porsche 911 Turbo S costs twice as much as in England. That’s pretty frustrating..
the accent was quite good :))))
Sorry but im a lambo fan boy so im gonna go lambo
Porsch
lamborghini aventador svj
Matt : Puts those on the ring  *Ferrari and Porsche left the chat*
Porsche no doubt
That’s dude face on that brake test 11:33-11:34 😂
Porsche Turbo
The Porsche is just insane, and it’s just as good around a track
Porsche is the best 😍
I think ill take the svj if i dont have 300k pounds ill take the porsche
Hey guys I'm the driver of the Porsche
Just came here to see that porsche winning,  wasn't disappointed
Dat porsche is fast,, but that V12 rhytm is absolut 🔥
Porsche & gtr forever ⭕⭕\_______/⭕⭕
guys yianni is not that rich, he can't even afford to buy me an omega watch.
Mat, that accent at the very beginning just 😂😂😂. Cheers from Italy 🇮🇹
Porsche
Ferrari forever❤️
911 best looking but that’s because I’ve got one 😎
You need some jdms
🔥🔥🔥
Definately Porsche ❤️❤️❤️ pls show this to Yani😂😂😂
Id be taking the Porsche over anything all day
I would buy the porsche if I could. It’s just the best car ever build in my opinion.
Porsche 😱
I'll have two Porsches over one SVJ any day!
Porsche
The 812 Super Fast sounded waaay Better, Beautiful Aggressive Notes
daaaamn from an Italian, intro was in between racist an hilarious. Love it
Porsche wins the drag race not because it’s better... but because it has the engine mounted behind and AWD. It’s not a fact of perfect engineering, come on, do you live under a rock? It’s simple physics. Anyway i love all three of em
That Audi svj looks good
for the next race take ferrari 488 pisa with porsche 911 turbo s and it could be the tough race
Porsche for me :)
How does the less powerful, cheaper and heavier Porsche always get the advantage over these hyper cars ? Someone please explain
Porsche Looks calm & Brings Tornado  on Road
statistically the lambo should win, its the most lightweight, most aerodynamic and has the most hrsprs, idfk what the germans did to that porsche but its a goddamn beast
Lambo is the class show-off and Ferrari is just simply ugly. Of these three I'd take the 911 every time, it's the all-round better car.
Porsche. Best car in the test and it will beat Ferrari and lambo on track as well
I would have the Porsche then Ferrari and never would I ever want this Lambo.
Bye bye boring Porsche ! aka Beetle
BINOD
Porch 💯🔥🔥
Ferrari 100% lol
Porsche 911 turbo s
Waow porshce amazing
porsche is underrated but its a beast by itself
I would go with the Porsche
Porche sounded better. Now, let me have it guys
Guys don't be mean to me but I just don't like the way Porsche looks .
Funny thing is the cheapest is the fastest !
Im in love with porsche right now❤️
Yianni jumpstart specialist
Yianni jumps the start again...actually every time...
Porche
Aventador
911
That SVJ is just ridiculous. Costs twice as much as the porche & is far slower.
1.Lamborghini 2.Porsche 3.Ferrari
Hey Mat! Can you race the Porsche against the 720s again? I'm pretty sure the 720S can tie the race, of not beat the Porsche with a better driver.
i don’t get how you want to buy a lambo. it’s a car from 15 years ago with old tech and bad interiors, plus is outrageously expensive. you have to be a real douce to buy one 🤷🏻‍♂️😂
Porsche 911.. obviously..
No doubt lambo looks smoking hot, but that Porsche is like the lowkey underdog!
Best drag race ever
Ferrari Ferrari Ferrari❤
East and west ferrari is best
Lambo SVJ
All I need is a Turbo S
Ferrari - SuperFast Porsche - SuperDuperFast yay
Ferrari
In 20 years these carwow videos will be part of the history education. Topic: best sounds human ears ever heard. Gone but not forgotten
Love that Porshe❤️
Who else would like to have an All-Rolls-Royce Drag Race!?!?! Let's see what happens!!!
We're gonna need the 992 turbo s vs 765lt vs F8 tributo
Ferrari F1 season in a nutshell
I want BMW x7 in depth review
Next Race with 911 GT 3RS
Have the lambo
Yianni cheated on the second rolling race but matt still pulled ahead and won, good on u matt🔥😂👍
The cheapest cars blazes both the far expensive Italian cars
One of the best, AND funniest, episodes so far. Yanni's angry face while driving is priceless, Matt's jokes keep improving and...that Porsche, keeps being crazy fast.
Great vid!!
Let’s talk about the bull beating the horse.. Dnt Porsche also have a horse in their logo?
That porsche is SICKK
That porsche is an engineering wonder. Hope to own one one day...
I like that Yanni said that the bull beat the stallion...
Lamborghini terzo vs buggati divo
If the Ferrari had four wheel drive or all wheel drive it would dominate
Best sound, SVJ,  money no object turbo S just because it's practical and it's got the germanic build quality.
I like how the Porsche silently kills the entire competition
the winner is porsche
The 911 turbo S🔥🔥🔥
Would still take the SVJ and the 812 over the Porsche. Singing V12 beats all.
Ferrari always❤️ Pls 911 turbo s vs 918 spyder 🔥
Porsche 911 ♥️
I would have lambo
They should bring the pista instead of the 812
I would buy the 812
812 👌
Yani always cheats 😂
Then why did the M8 dropped the ferrari on a race
That Porsche just kills it
The real race? Ferrari vs Lambo 😀
Porsche 911 anytime
Porsche all day long
🙈🙈🙈🙈
When I see a Lambo I just think Yianni is inside
Seeing Yianni loose is very entertaining. :))
911 TurboS anyday 💯
Turbo S..pls
Yianni is the one person for whom I Watch These Drag Races....He just makes the video so much better... drop a like below for him👍
you should have lined the F8 instead of the 812.
The sound of the italian language explain why they are bad engineers and incompetent in technical and engineering sciences.
Svj
Porsche
Definitely the Porsche
Yianni so want to beat Mat, and can I just say the Porsche exhaust is CRAP!!!!!!!!!!
Porsche
should have let the porsche do the rolling race in 2nd gear when its in boost
It's not the fair comparison between lambo and Ferrari, SVJ is top hardcore version of aventador just wait for 812 GTO!!!! It will destroy SVJ @carwow should consider this
Svj
Ferrari any day
Porsche for me.. 😁😁
Love the accents 😍😍
Obvio Ferrari 812 superfast
100% the Porsche, looks and seems amazing
7.03 if you want to cut the bullshit and see the race 🏁
6:35 CS panda had 21 subscribers then  Now it’s more than 160 subscribers 😂  Edit 2 : OH MY god that channel subscribers are growing like hell 😳  Edit 3: 260 now 😨  Edit 4: it passed 1.18 k 😳
Ferrari’s last n/a car will skyrocket
0:01 did anyone else think that it was carwow Italy or something?
If i could sell it id get the SVJ, sell it and buy a Porsche GT3RS, if i had to keep it id take the Turbo S.
I'll take the 812 superfast
No Doubt SVJ
Porsche 911 TurboS
Ferrari being rear wheel drive performs extremely good..  I'll pick the ferrari
Yianni always jumping the start
that porsche is the winner of all the race wow it stunning, it was the lowest horsepower among the other car
Porsche for performance but Ferrari for the looks just anything but the lambo
ahahahahahaha
Sounds like something broke on the transmission of the Ferrari...
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ!!
I will habe the turbo S all the way
Yanni jumping the start as per usual and still losing as per usual
Buggati chiron vs Lamborghini SVJ 63
Flat 6 is fast then v12 just changed my imagination
Money no object it would have to be the SVJ for me!   That Porsche though........ 😲
Matt cant even win when he jumps the start lol
Porsche is the best car in the world
That’s pdk gearbox is lit man
That Lambo should have won considering it’s price. Embarrassing for Lamborghini
imagine this porsche would have as much hp as the lambo.  It would be too fast for the camera🤣
I love porsche's.... Lamb is too much flashy... And i have ferrari Allergy....
Porsche is in its league of it's own.
LAMBO FERRARI BOTH IS GOOD
Yianni: “come on, uhhh ohhh” 😂
Porsche might not look as good or sound as good, but it’s the best car there by a mile. In the real world it’s the fastest, has the best usability, comfort, economy and practicality. That Turbo S is a game changer 👏
I would buy the Porsche!! What a beast!
Ferrari !
I would definitely have the Porsche all the way
The 812 easy
Porsche all day every day
I love Porsche but that Ferrari V12 is something else
Yianny always cheats cause he’s so gassed 🤣🤣
yianny jumped the start on the first drag race and still lost lmfao
Porsche now has the quickest petrol car and the best electric car. What an amazing brand.
Ferrari all day
Porsche 911 turbo s 😍😍😍
if the new 992 GT2 Drops this will be the king for years.
That energy yanni has makes more entertaining
Just bring one time dodge challenger SRT Demon  I am sure it will be fun with 840 hp, 770 lb-ft on racing fuel.
911  all day every day .team 911
i would actually have a ferrari a know even though porsche ya know.
Porsche all-day long baby 🙃
Yanni jumped the start
It ain't past the Porsche. Not even a GT2 or GT2 RS that.
Ferrari all day long. 😍
I would have bought the ferrari.
Porsche 911 992 turbo s is my favorit
This is without a doubt the best sounding car wow Drag race that has ever happened, if not, someone link me to a better one since this is porn to my ears.
every video I see Yanni starting early lol
Ur all sleeping on the ferrari if any of the races went any longer it would have passed all of them
The accent though is great
Ferrari is FERRARI
Funny how they focus the video on the Lambo and the Ferrari forgetting the Porsche which is winning everything. Jajajaja. It's another level.
definitely Porsche
The SVJ is not a drag car 😌 It is a track one. It would crush the ferrari on a circuit but only beat the porsche. It's all about aero and sofisticated turning mechanics. Although, why not a dual clutch ? 🥺
Svj sounds good.... 👍👍👍😁
911.. 100% for me
I’d take the Ferrari for sure! To me, its the best sounding. Plus it’s rear wheel drive. Absolute animal. Could have so much fun with it.
Porsche
Porche is love💥❤️
Lambo,Lambo,Lambo 💪💪💪💪💪💪
Ovvioudly i would have porche 911
When reviewing the car: It even has a tyre pressure warning system. What a technology.  When discussing the car with your friends: This system it has can actually save your life! Imagine having a flat at 200km/h! When you drive and get an actual warning: Deactivates system continues driving.
Second drag was probably the best race I've seen on the channel!!!
Unbelievable the porsche, just unbelievable
Ferrari all day long
Lambo all the time, looks fantastic. More of an event car.
I’m a Porsche guy so the Porsche every day! But the sound of the Lambo is epic!
That Ferrari sounds beautiful
I would have the aventador svj
And the Aventador SVJ weighs 3,900lbs which translates to 1,769kg which is heavier than the 3,845lbs Ferrari which translates to 1,744kg. And the 812 is heavy because it's supposed to be a Super GT car, it just happens to be fast.
All 3
Lamborgini Aventador SVJ
Porsche 🏁🔥
My uncle has an nardo grey ish 812 and a Black on black La Ferrari I Love The sounds they make!
porsche is way better in all fields except lookwise😅
The fun fact: While he tried to talk with a german accent he sounded like the purest british dude a german could imagine
Holy moly that Porsche
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ. Way to go Yanni 🍾🍾🍾
Lambo all day every day
Turbo S
812 followed by the SVJ 😤
Porsche of course! Only crazy Yianni buys lambos
No matter how fast electric cars will be...but they'll never have the jaw dropping, orgasmic sound of ic engines.
Ferrari 812 superfast
Bro I am a lambo and a porsche fanboy
Porsche Turbo S all day long
if you are spitting fire and loud means you are losing most of your power there.
svjjjj
Thank you SO MUCH CARWOW brought MOST MY FAVORITES Rare SUPERCAR Lamboghini SVJ .. I feel in love SVJ then Other girls 😍😍😍🤣
The aventador svj would be the car I would       chosen because it's a Lamborghini 😈😈😎😎
Porsche for me thanks.
Is it day time over there? Or just uploaded at this time?
Porsche launch control is amazing... my guess is Ferrari has nerved their launch control because other models had problems with clutch breaking after a couple of launches.
lamboo svj for suree
No one beats the germans
Ferrari 812 superfast best looking car and sound much better lamborghini
Am I the only one who gets excited when there's a Ferrari in a carwow video?
Everyone is a gangster when thr real gangster(Porsche) arrives🔥
Yiannimize is back🤣🤣🤣
I mocked up a Ferrari 488 Pista the other day to see what it looked like without the stripe, It looked amazing!
Am I the only one who always wants to see the guy in the third car?😂😂  Maybe its the stig from top gear....
Lamb SVJ❤️🔥
Speak softly and carry a big stick. Porsche Turbo S...my dream car...in Python Green with the carbon roof though.👍🏻
I still don’t understand how the Porsche is that fast with half the horsepower
AVENTADOR SVJ
Definitely Porsche, tats really did great job
Nice race and commentary thanks mat and Yanni made my Saturday all the way from South Africa
Its lighter because of the transsmission matt ...
Turbo s all day long.....
That 911 is unreal.  Just does it in silence.  Ferrari best looking but I'd buy the Porsche.
Lambo is the  greatest car
The Porsche is thinking: **ck physics!
It's always more fun to watch yiannimize in the video
The 992 turbo s.... That engineered beauty...... And the best looking....simple and elegant
Come ti sei permesso di parlare così italiano, i'm just kidding
The best looking car between these three is definately the LAMBORGHINI !!! And I would definately choose the svj over any other car 😍😍🤩
A drag race with a Lamborghini and no Yianni is no drag race. I wish they could have the 720s in the race too. Yianni's reaction on the second race though 😂😂😂😂
Porsche is a quite assasin
911 The silent assasin
no way the porche 911 turbo s only has 650 hp, when it can beat a lambo with 120 hp more and whights 100 kg less
i'll have the aventador svj
Despite its smaller engine, broooooo that Porsche is shredding.  All day, everyday 🇩🇪 cars
Porsche🙏🏻🙌🏻
Humble Porsche , does the job quite silently and at almost half the price of other two cars.
Is this how us Italians really sound to y'all lmao?
Porsche
Best channel ever
WTF THAT PORSCHE HOW IT COST 156k and destroyed a 360k LAMBO
Porsche it is.
Ferrari is da best!!
I don't like Lamborghini anymore 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️😪😥
Underrated intro 😂
I’d be walking towards the Ferrari dealership to pick up the 812 and at the last second I’d swerve and buy the Lambo. Porsche doesn’t even enter the equation, boring.
Porsche is the Master of Race, German talks a little and work more!
woah im early
911 spanked the Italians lol
Never been this early to a carwow video It's almost 5am
plz a gt2 rs vs 911 turbo s  vs gt3rs
Finally I've been waiting for the Svj to race
911
Porsche sounded za best
Porsche 911 Turbo S all day
I would have the lambo still. Just nab more eyes than a Porsche ever will
Porsche as a daily, Ferrari for weekends and lambo to drive to the store and buy Monsters and doritos
I feel like this is the wrong comparison. It is  something like 720S vs Pista vs Turbo S. The SVJ and 812 are for a completely different purpose. SVJ is a track car. 812 is a grand tourer. And they focus on the emotion part with big V12s. They are about the feel. They are not about being an emotionless rocketship which you can't even hear. The Porsche is great still, but this isn't the right comparison. Turbo cars will always have more torque and will almost always beat an NA car. 812 and SVJ are special cause V12s are going extinct now. All three cars live to serve different purposes
To speak italian well, you have to move more your hands😂👌🏻
next time put a Turbo engined Ferrari too like the F8 Tributo vs the Porsche "Turbo" S though, ah & that's right Lambo's don't have any.. sry...
SVJ lambo for life
I love how yanni is like yeeesss jus getting off the line faster than matt 😂
Turbo S all day!
go VW
I would like to have a Lambo
Ferrari super fast
Porsche 911 turbo S
That Porsche is just a bargain for what it really is.
Italians: Let’s put some big engine and many cylinders. Germans: Let me beat that with a V6
This drag couldn't have been better than this! Thank you carwow team.
Even with the Lambo jumping the start the Porsche still gets it. Keep that overpriced cheap build Lambo. I'll buy the Porsche and with  the money left il buy a Bmw M5
Ferrari looks the best and sounds better than others too
Porsche is the best regarding price&quality👍
Quell'accento finto mi urta i sensi
Porche ;)
I love Rarries, but I would rather ride my bike rather than those insanely fast rockets....😆
When Matt start with the ancients I know it is good
Softlimiters have to go. Fun is now definetely banmed in the EU. Starting to understand why the UK leaves the EU.
I so always want Yianni to win. Always😅
Porsche all day long....understated and classy
As a porshe fanboy i feel so happy when it win the drag race hit like if you feel happy too
SVJ wasn't made for straights
L would have the Lamborghini
porshe  the best!!!!
I’ll take turbo S
dude the Porsche winning it’s crazy for almost half the prize of the contenders 🤍
Thinking of the Porsche, having 150hp less to the Superfast, it’s definitely the Porsche
Who else loves the quick camera shots to Yianni looking all pumped up and competitive 😂 the man gets an A* for the passion to win.
every time Matt and Yanni do a drag race with the 911 it is always ends up being the safety/camera car
Porsche 911 Turbo S is the best car🏆🏆🏆
Ferrari definitely sounds better than lambo
This Ferrari 812 is even faster than the SF1000. Get this car on SPA!
Okay so that porsche now qualifies to do a drag with Koenigsegg and the bugg. 😈
Lambo for cruising around the street and Porsche for the racing and motorways😂 it’s like a sleeper
Superfast
Wishing to have the Turbo S...with the Lambo sound...and maybe Ferrari interior. But that Lambo sounds...bloody mental...sorry Porsche...
911 all the way!!!
Porsche sounded the best
Porsche!!!!!
“Only”
The 812 superfast is not a super car it's a Grand tourer That's e why it's slow
911is a beast!
Money no object, it's the porsche all day long. Matt said it's the better car and it is, and its half the price of the other two
I’d take the 911 turbo s
That porsche isnt made in Earth
This must be on of the most epic drag races on carwow, by side the one with the 720s, pista and Sv 😍🙏 do more like this one
I’ll pick the Porche for class tbh. Ferrari on the Autobahn 👌🏽
🇩🇪
Always the Porsche 😍 That German engineering 💪
Ferrari no shit is what I'd choose
Ferrari
Aventador SVJ vs Huracan Performante
When its a lambo, you know who is behind the steering. 😂
Porsche
I like Porsche's so its Porsche
Ferrari for 70-200+ mph Acceleration  Porsche for the Launch and brakes  Lamborghini for the looks
I would have the Ferrari
Why does the 911 design grow on you?!? I love it more and more everytime it comes on the channel.
Please may we see a Ferrari 488 pista , Lamborghini aventador  SVJ and the the porche turbo S or GT2 RS
SVJ
Lamborgini all day 😌😌😌
porsche all day any day
Yanni is the main! jump starter.
Love the dip on the line. Made all the difference.
I fucking don't care who won. LAMBO SVJ is the Best!
Must 765LT can defeat 911
Even though the Porsche is the fastest, I would still go for the lambo. It looks the best it sounds the best and you get the best experience in the lambo.
I take the Ferrari
Porsche Turbo S!
7:34 when u use all ur power to keep going till she is done. Lol
I'll love to get the porsche. I love fast cars. The fastest I've got from my lexus ES350  is 180 km/h... @Mat and to everyone, What's the fastest you've got in a car?
911 Turbo S
Imagine owning a ferrari and got 70 subs
Looooool this video was entertaining 🤣
If uncle Bens rice made a car advert
that Porsche is the perfect example of keeping you head down, not making any noise and letting your work and results do all the talking
I love lamborgini but the Porsche turbo s is underrated
Turbo S ❤️
Ferrari sounds better
WTF with that Porsche?! :O It won again, against twice as much expensive, lighter and more aerodinamic car? How the fuck? :O
Porsche, there is no substitute.
Plz like for Porsche because is a beast .
That’s INSANEEE! 🔝🤜🏼🤛🏼❤️
That Lamborghini was in "strada" mode, that means "road", you should've put it in "corsa" or "pista", don't know how is it called in that car
Lambo sound all the way, i pick the Porsche anyday
I just love Lamborghini for it's amazing sound and design
Porshe ne araba yapmış be, deli kalkıyo makine
Porsche, everytime
Mat jumped the start
Yianni: Let’s talk about the bull beating the horse. Me: Well the Porshe is technically a horse too, ya know? (Yes I’m that guy)
My next car will be a Porsche 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
If you see a lambo, you now it’s yanni
That posrshe may be fast but ...i would pick #LAMBORGHINI anyday anytime
Lamborghini all day every day, I like the 812,but I'm a huge fan of Aventadors🔥🔥
LAMBO cost 200k more and Porsche still win crazy Porsche
Yanni always jumps the start.....?
that porsche is insane
Really entertaining Matt and love it when yanni is on 👍
So what do you need those extra 6 cylinders for?? 🤔
Ferrari 812
The reason I wouldn’t buy the Lambo or an R8 isn’t because of how my bank account is set up but because the gear changes feel like someone giving you the Heimlich manoeuvre
I know the Ferrari is the worst out of the 3 but my god that thing is so classy
812 sounded the best
Porsche all day everyday. Never been a lambo fan and never will be. Losing my flair for Ferrari. Italians you need to pick up your game.
Porsche Is the dragons Slayer now....
That single-clutch gearbox of the Aventador is a total let down. The DCT of the Huracan would suit the V12 much much better.
Yanni clearly jump started the first drag race!
why not chose a gt2 rs ^^ no sense 5:22 drag race
So, the conclusion is, the cheapest car is actually the best!
5:23 pretty sure that's a jump start, even if it's marginal. Matt too was quite late off the line
We need a Porsche 911 Turbo S vs 765lt
Always amazing how the Porsche pushes forwards! Love it! The engineering is stunning 🔥👏
Porsche won without shouting xd
Matt of course most people would still have the Lambo
You put an add in the middle of the Ferrari reving??? COME ON PEOPLE! This is sacrilege! This is madness!
You are a genius😂😂
Mat jumped the start
Best Brand ever  PORSCHE
The best car Porsche 911 Turbo S
More accents in future videos please Mat ;)
porsche for sureeee
812 is the best
Ferrari
best car out of all of those is definitely the porsche
THE PORSCHE ALL THE WAY
A huge request from carwow Can u do a drag race with the lamborghini aventador svj and McLaren 720s and the pista
Ferrari and Lamborghini to  Porsche  SERIOUSLY 🥺
Lamborghini
The ferrari sounded better then the rest of the cars
Porsche 911 Turbo S  - ANYTIME!!!
11:57 yes, the Porsche looks the best. And that’s on periodt.
Man the porsche is really the drag queen . Half the cylinder almost 150 hp lesser than other cars still it blasted off like a rocketship.
Porsche, doing more with less and still drivable as a daily with great reliability
Yanni really likes to jump the start
Ferrari
Which car would I drive ? I honestly think its not that hard.  Porsche eyery day of the year over any of the others
Idk how Porsches have least power and always win like if u agree
Can you do a bugatti drag race ? With any car that matches it.. i bet there ain't non but maybe Hennessey? Or Koenigsegg
German engineering is always 👌
Lamborghini as well on the Race😘
That turbo s is Absolute monster
❤PORSCHE❤
Nobody Nobody does it better than a Porsche !!
The porshe sounded i mean it didbt even have a sound
The lambo sounds godly
Turbo S 100%
I'd have the Ferrari then sell it and buy 2 turbos s and one gtr r34 ☺
812 all the way. Best sounding car a lot cleaner
Porsche say barking dogs never bites. LoLLLL
It is 1am dammit! Lmao
Yianni is the only one who tries to add an extra 10 hp THROUGH his whole body into the cars 😜😂😂
This Porsche is really insane woow what a car
I would have the SVJ just to sell it and buy 2 Porsche
Can i have the  turbo S hehehe
And they say a porsche is a poor mans ferrari or lambo lol Porsches have been smoking every car for decades
Jesus Christ. We're not gonna see that Porsche get defeated until the Tesla Roadster are we?
Porsche the best car brand in the world.
262k seems like a bargin for the 812 really.
Porsche
There are only one supercar, the Turbo S. Others are way of transportation.
The lambo and Ferrari are showing their design age now. That turbo s is on another level.
Yanni jumped the first one
Porsche all day everyday.  Under the radar Matt!  Think you should get one as your daily driver!   Come on Matt get the boss on the phone to Porsche GB ASAP!
German engineering: cold and calculated efficiency. I’d take the lambo just for the exhaust not, even though it’s slower.
Turbo s is a silent killer ;)
The thing is though  The Porsche looks like it has run out of competition
so Porsche, what exactly your doing here...?!
The Porsche won the Drag race, period. Also a bargain compared to the two since its 100,000 pounds cheaper. Porsche for me
What is happening to Porsche exhausts? They used to sound so good until the 992! This also has to be one of the greatest drag races in this channel yet hands down
The smug face on the Porsche driver at 11:32 😂😂😂
what are you feeding that porsche?  lmao
Finally, carwow!!! A video we needed in a long time!!!! Nice one🔥🔥🔥
Porsche has no manners for making the Turbo S
Yianni just 100% jumped the start
The Ferrari sound better than the Lambo
I will have THE LAMBO
Porsche is insane - 100hp less and 100kg more than lambo and still fastest
You can't beet that Porsche        Even with a veyron
Mann that porsche is seriously fastttt!!
That single clutch gearbox on the lambo is what its holding it back
812 over the others any day
I will have 812 superfast
Porsche BEST OF THE BEST!!!
When that lambo was doing doughnuts it was literally singing
Love how the Ferrari and Lambo are flexing how loud they are before the race and the Porsche just takes the win.
Wake up to mat Watson what’s this then
Always porsche
Porsche 911 turbo s is incredible, it is faster than a Lamborghini or Ferrari!!!
porsche
Absolutely the lambo
What a bad loser  😂😳😳😭😭 Yanni
Ciao, bella. Issa Matta Watson 😂😂😂😂😂😂
GERMANS💪
I would have Porsche if I had any money
Tesla win. Oups... :D
porsche for sure with that cost it smoked ferrari and lambo...perfect sports car
Svj turboed
Very good Duo of drivers, very funny.
ferrari for me
I would deffo have the Ferrari. It’s my dream car
lets be honest..the race was between ferrari and lamborghini.....porshe wasnt even a concern!!!
It will be The 812 superfast for Me the beautiful car
PLEASE DO AUDI R8 VS 911 TURBO
Lamborghini SVJ
Porsche is f*ckin fast!
Porsche for life!!!!
911 vs model s
Performance - Turbo S Ballers - Ferrari & Lambo
Can we just give the Porsche some credit for sticking with the SVJ and The 812 pretty well
That porsche is a silent killer😳👊🏼
812 superfast
Always Porsche at the top ❤
frustrated face of yani is epic hehe
Ferrari only for the looks but Porsche all day long
nissan gtr
I'd 100% have that Lamborghini, the premium price is worth it for the sound alone!
Porsche is the best car ever
drag race along with mc laren 720s would be nice
Ferrari all the way
without jump starting，lambo is relatively slow tbh…
911 turbo S. Lambo's are a posers car so it's perfect for Yianni hahahah
The ferrari is the best sounding
i had turn up the volume to even hear the porsche😂😂
The race I've been waiting for
I would have the lambo.
Definitely the Ferrari
Porsche
Your not supposed to drive a lambo in Strada mode.  I don't say it but there's something like that🤷
we want a dodge deamonnnnnnn mat!
carwow is gold.
Sees the name AVENTADOR on the thumbnail. Me: Here comes Yianniiiiiiiiiiiiii. hahaha
Turbo for me - the only one you can drive on British roads
@carwow if I have money definitely I would buy a Porsche
Porsche's 1hp=2.5hp of any other manufacturer
@carwow it’s such a hard choice between the Porsche and the Ferrari. As a daily car the Porsche would be the ultimate car but the sound and looks of that Ferrari are just to die for, but if one could just put a new set of exhausts on the Porsche and get rid of the soft limiter, the Porsche is definitely the superior car there .
https://youtu.be/AK8VoKQGYuw
PORSCHE TURBO S IS THE BEST
Imagine how would be a serious trouble if that porsche was modified     Even it is actually serious trouble with stock lol
Volkswagen sounded better
I will buy the porche
812 superfast my 2nd  favorite car and it sounds better
Watson, your content is good. Bomb video!
That single clutch gearbox is single handedly ruining the aventador
Lamborghini SVJ all day any day🥰😍🤟
Wait isn't 812 is a super gt
812 SF babe
Porsh Is silly fast
I'd have the Porsche
Mmmm Luigi they are a doing a draga raciya 😂
Who can beat Porsche? 🤔
Superfast hands down
porche
I would take the Turbo S because it doesn't look like a supercar it's a bit understatement
Lambo all day everyday
If the lambo had a dual clutch it would have won . Porsche got ahead on gear changes
I would take the svj
I would have porsche of course❤️👍
Porsche 911 turbo for sure
That lambo does not sound better than the Ferrari
Sorry , but for the money the lambo wasn't even the race 🤷
Is it just me or this Ferrari looks suspiciously like Viper ?! 🙄
I have BMW M2.....
Porsche 911 = that cute little girl in school who kicks everyone's ass....
Should includw 720s too in this race . It would be nicer
Ferrari all day
Somehow matt managed to sound like a flamboyant german while mimicking a german accent
Ferrari All Day All Night ... No one can compare to Horse 🐎
that 812 is clean af
Ferrari
Turbo s vs chiron?😂
As a Porsche fanboy this definetely makes me cheer up :)
812 all day every day
Ferrari
Mat use pattle shifter
Get a mk5 Supra on channel, Tuned.
Because you've never brang a Hellcat down there...
Thé best Chanel in the world  From algeria ❤
Svj
🤣🤣🤣I love how the Porsche just does what it does best without the unnecessary drama.
i would prefer that porsche over the other 2 by far so much more practical
Porsche is the best
1. you jumped the 2nd start 2. best looking by far the Lambo 3. which to buy? Porsche, but if you have enough money, take the Lambo and the Porsche
I think this dragrace would be epic: 488 PISTA VS SVJ VS Turbo S VS 720S
Anyone notice how crap the speedo is on the Ferrari? Not sure if it’s the camera or not. It’s ‘jerky’.
I’d have SVJ
Not even a single soul  Me: yianny reminds me of dj khaled
The lambo sounds best
Ahh we all know how this would go , turbo S for it's insane launch, 812 for it's speed and it has alot less drag compared to the Aventador
Pure evil in Yanni's eyes...sweet Jesus!!!
Strata Is for street
The porsche did considerably well though these aren't it's actual rivals and it wasn't even far off in the in gear rolling race although down on power..... I'd take the Porsche anyday it's just brilliant 💯
is yanni putting weight on?
Porsche porsche porsche!!! Im in loveeeee!!!
I would have the Lambo!! That sound leaves you speechless!!
The aventador looks and sounds the best which is what the aventador is all about so I would have the svj for that reason only.
The cheapest car is the best car
10:25 he pushed the door open of a ferrari with his foot/shoe Disgusting
You dont mess with german cars
Ferrari best looking car
The battle is between lambo and Ferrari..Porsche is just a guest for this race ..long live The King - Porsche
Ferrari always
You cant beat a Porsche
I GOT SO HAPPY WHEN I SAW YIANNI
That Porsche is just straight SAVAGE
Lamborghini
These two cars totally got the eyes . That Porsche is just the fastest thing now . Still the Horse and the Bull ❤️❤️❤️ all day long
I would only own the Porsche 911 turbo s or Nissan GTR 😎
He is talking in language of GoDs
SVJ
Aventador is modded
Aventador svj!!
Anyday the ferrari , which moron would choose a Lamborghini over a Ferrari that's totally hilarious
Yanni said lets talk about the Bull beating the Horse but he lost to e porsche which also has a Horse in the logo💁🏼‍♂️🤣
Porsche' s engineers are genius.
Ferrari 812
Only if the svj had the same transmission as the Huracan......
Porsche
If I could have one of these beauties.It would definitely be the Ferrari🏎
Do a Review about the Ferrari 812 superfast and the lamborghini Avendator SVJ
Ferrari any day over the Lamborghini
McLaren 720s Vs Ferrari 812 superfast Vs Lamborghini Aventador SVJ......  McLaren will definitely annihilate the two cars
Is porche is giving 911 some sort of drugs or what?
Can you imagine having one of these....
Hey mat pls do a race between Sian vs turbo 911s vs 720s
Lambo all day every day😍
Ferrari
It’s honesty amazing how the Porsche is CHEAP compared to the others but faster 😂, but it doesn’t look as good and the sound isn’t as loud 👍
Out of the three I'd go for the Turbo... It's extremely quick for it's money😀 but if the Lambo was an Aventador S Roadster, I would take it everyday 🤣
Porsche's performance for its price is just mind blowing🤯🤯🤯🤯
Almost every Porsche model is completely insane. What a brand!  Oh and also... that Ferrari is soooooo SEXY!!
I couldn't care less about the Porsche. Aventador for me with its oldschool, brutal gearbox please
The last of their Kind
812 anyday bruv
PTS 🏆
I’m, I the only one excited the Porsche won!!! Maybe it’s cause I own an Audi!! German pride!!
The Lamborghini still looks and sounds the best. For a car that came out in 2012 and I’m impressed still today. 😍😍
Porsche may be the fastest and cheapest but it's a dime a dozen here in Southern California, so I would take the Lambo by a long shot.  The Ferrari just look weird, like a boot or shoe to me.
Porsche engineering vs Italian passion
I’d probably say the Ferrari just in black it does look aggressive
The German Car won
Aventador SVJ
That Porsche did the business.
The turbo S
That Porche 992 911 S is superfast 👌🏾that silver does not make it intimidating but I love it❤️
911 turbo s looks best
Turbo beats everything every time, and if it doesn't give it 2 minutes to turn up the boost
I’ll take the Porsche everytime.
Best intro
Let's see when the 812 gets the new generation upgraded "TDF"package...
Τhe ferrari
Porsche is that fast it’s ignored throughout the video😂 So much performance for that price
Porscheeee!!!
Svj
Lamborghini svj, but like the performante more🇮🇹
Ferrari
Porsche 💪💪💪
The Porsche 911 Turbo S is an example of perfect engineering. So impressive.
The 911 is no joke jheez
SVJ is lit 🔥    Always gonna choose the lambo
Funny that Matt and Yanni don't talk about the Porsche cause they know it's the fastest even with a lot less power
I would have the Porsche every day.
Yianni talkin' about the freind who lend him a lambo. Meanwhile me talkin about that freind who didnt turn on hotspot for me😂
svj allday allday
the most eargasmic video of all time..!  those V12s are godlike
DBS Superleggera vs 812 Superfast would be 🔥
I'd love to have Lamborghini aventador svj
Lamborghini all day every day
That potsche just runs like hell. That’s a serious car! Without the bangs and whistles
it really brought me a smile on my face when i saw yanni  ....coz i know it would be a great video ....whenever yanni is there and mat u are awsome
Ламборгiнi$$$
Porsche looks the best
The countdown girl.. now i can sleep
PORSCHEEE NOT PORSCH OMG
damn
Porsche sounded the best                                                       kidding - always the aventador
Lambo
Why Yanni always jumpstart wtf? 5:22.... hands still in the air, he jumped...
Me scrolling down the comment My brain : damnn i wish i said that
Porsche sound for the night 🌃 And Ferraris /Lamborghinis sound for the day 🔊
Porsche all day everyday.
Imagine how a 992 gr2rs would literally trash these supercars
Ferrari of course 😛
That 911 Turbo S is a silent killer... might not sound the best but its there for one purpose and one purpose only - tear up the 1/4mile
For the first few seconds, I thought I landed on a dubbed carwow film lol
Now we know why the Porsche is grey, in the back, and the driver not showed 🤣
812 definitely sounds better
Yianni is back? Finally.
SJV
i want to see svj vs 720s it would be cool!
The Porsche is blistering fast but where’s the sensation of a proper sounding sports car I’d go Lamborghini svj all day any day
Mat can you buy a car for god's sake
Half the cylinders and two turbos would do the trick.
YOU SHOULD BMW X5M VS  Mercedes Benz AMG
WHEN WILL THE PORSCHE BE BEATEN!!!!!
Yanni is gaining weight like crazy bruh u might have add more drag to the Lamborghini
Bring a 720s in there and get rid of the Porsche.... That'll be the tightest drag race ever!!!!!  The Lamborghini looks and sounds the best tho❤️❤️
Ferrari, because it is faster in gear than the others.
Definitely the Porsche won the rev battle
That turbo S smoked everyone again🥵
Drag race the P1 vs 720s vs 911 turbo s, that would be lit like this make it visible to Mat.
0:59 You sure bout dat? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUYV6jOs1J0&t=302s
The Ferrari no doubt, should be red or yellow tho
OMG WE DON'T TALK LIKE THIS
Please drag race : BMW M5 2021 vs Porsche Panamera 2021
The Porsch is like: Cmon Mat and Yan get on with the introductions I have to destroy your cars yet another time.
https://youtu.be/bFz9wR-LA-Q
This is one of the best lineups I’ve seen in carwow’s races.
That Porsche is the beast. That's my ultimate dream car right now.
BMW 😂😂
Sv-J
porsche for life
Turbo S all day. Understatement is key
Supra
The cheapest, most practical car is also the fastest, best stopping, most reliable....and in my opinion the best looking. The other two are too flash. With the 992 and the Taycan, Porsche have served notice to the entire industry.
the svj looks and sounds the best
God these natural aspirated V12s sound like a gate to heaven...😍
Even if I had the money to buy all of the cars. I would pick the Porsche.
I hate the Lamborghini
Porsche 100%!!!!!!!!!!
Ferrari sounded the best
The Porsche 911 Turbo S is the best sports car in the world. Period.
This Turbo S is insane! Need one how much can i safe through carwow?
Turbo s definitely 😂
Different drivers,, different results,, that Porsche tho! 😲
Svj and 911
Porsche 911 turbo s
God, how do they build Porches like this...such efficiency
Porsche engineering = NASA engineering
Lambo: we have the best looks and a v12 Ferrari: we are super fast and we got a v12 Porsche: hold my 3.8 flat six
This has to be the best sounding drag race on carwow.
I would take Turbo S at any day
I'm suggest that the 812 super fast looks so good and fierce looking
Porsche 911 turbo s
The Porsche is driving itself , right?
That 911 992 Turbo S .. is turning out to be the greatest 2020 car .. the only good thing to come out of the covid 19
Flat 6 powah baby 😂 v12 my a**
Well knew the 911 was you know...before it started
I choose the Ferrari. 👍👍👍
porsche looks the best
Allthough  Drag race: 911 turbo s Rolling race: 812 Brake test: surprised by Porsche  But at the end of the day I will say LAMBORGHINI ALL DAY EVERY DAY BABY!!
SVJ the best looking car and the noisest (what an orchestra!!), Ferrari the most emotional (light warnings and weird noises...) and the Porsche the better... by far...
I don't believe that porsche has 650hp
The germans are the only ones who can show everyone who's boss
The title says it .. turbo s won the race
I love all these cars so mutch!
Mat, learn to pronounce Porsche correctly!!!! Itis time to finally learn it.
I would definitely have the svj
The ferrari needs a novitec exhaust
svj ofc
indians can buy all3  cars in the price of any one of this 3 cars 😂
porshe 911 is the best in these  cars .
Porsche exhaust from Brussels PDF committee
I'd definitly have the Porsche 911 Turbo S. This car is mental and way cheapper than the others and it won the drag races. Then, the style... I've never been a big fan of Lambos... I like the Ferrari, but honestly, I prefer the Porsche again : the style of the 911 is timeless.
Porsche is the one
What about *NIO EP9*  Can you try it
Does anyone notice number plates of 3 cars on the thumbnail??
am i the only one who thinks porsche did a amazing job on the new 911 turbo s. Just look at that thing go. It completely destroys those italian way to expensive cars
Money no object, I would probably get the Aventador, because I don't want the Ferrari after Mat soiled his pants in it.
At last Porche is always the winner no matter how many SVR, cylinders or HP or any stupid figures on papers.
Ferrari all day lad
That Porsche is seriously impressive.
That intro tho😂😂
Lookwise for me the Porsche looks best..the other cars looks overdone..
Can we got a RUF Porsche on this drag
Lambo SVJ anyday mate ahha
The Porsche is the KING 👑
finally seeing a SVJ drag
Porsche silently destroyed them both with less power and lower price tag. 🤘
shows how slow lambo is, when Yianni still jumps all starts.
I'll take the porsche
If the 812 had AWD I would pick it! But I will go with the 911 turbo S .
Obviously I'd want Porsche to wreck both Yanni AND Mat
11:34 you can see porsche driver smug face. 😂😂
German Engineering 💪🏻
Damn that Porsche is insane!!!
Ahahahah ciao bella! Grande Matt!
Caooooo Lamborghini and Ferrari caoooo frommmm Porsche wtffff this 911 its fasttttttt🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Porsche not good looking but definitely way better than other, earned respect and now my favorite and not expensive though 🙏
2nd pass ferrari jumped the start like shit. still nice run, although 812 is not the best comparison, rather Pista or F8
812 sf all day Ferrari everyday
Porsche is that one quiet kid in class who everyone underestimates until the day comes
Lamborghini sounds absolutely fantastic 🔥💯
Never mind the line up, the speed of my click has never been so fast!!!
Porsche 🔥
911 turbo S ftw
That turbo s man it's getting boring
Rip BLACK PANTHER
That Porsche is something else with 6 cylinders
Porsche is taking it seriously in drag race with lambo and Ferrari 😁
Matt, we're all already subscribd, stop talking and burn your tires 😁
Porsche says: oh little Italian kids here, lets watch them playing from finish line
Holy moly that Porsche is insane
Anybody will have the Porsche
That Porsche is something else. The guys at Porsche must be grinning ear to ear if they ever watch these videos
Does anyone notice number plates of 3 cars on the thumbnail??
Porsche obv
992 turbo S of course
Do not attend this Porsche in any race because it will destroy everyone 😍😍😍💪💪
Ferrari
Ferrari prob perfect combination of the lambo and porsche and it looks really good all black.
Sorry Yianni, I'd have the Ferrari but I'd also buy a Porsche as a 'run around' (definitely not in Silver, though)
I'll be honest. I like the Ferrari F12 the best out of these 3 in terms of looks. Just because Lamborghini focuses on a really flashy design which makes it pretty douchy in my opinion whereas the Ferrari looks a bit more plain if you could use such a word on a supercar hahaha
Lamboyanni SVJ no question
The toughest drag race I have been seen ever 😍 Good job Porsche
i'd choose either Ferrari or Porsche cuz both of them look hella amazing
just buy the porsche 911 turbo s for almost half the price.
Porsche is the new Nissan Gtr. Half the price but will embarrasse Ferrari and Lamborghini.
Turbo S all day long.
I would sacrifice my left pinky toe to own that Porsche
Aventador any day all day
Turbo s
Looks Ferrari anytime but the Porsche is on whole different level 🔥
It's shocking that the car with smallest name won Btw yianni's mom Vs mat's mom drag race
Svg of course
I would get the SVJ turbo fast.
Man! That Porsche is a rocketship!
It's Lamborghini svj it's absolutely beast
Lamborghini Aventador svj
swap the Porsche for the Mclaren 720s...Than we have a race😎
650hp 770hp 800hp and the winner is 650hp 😂
“Only”🤣
I´m convinced Porsche horsepower are worth more
Quarantine life makes Mat more productive 😅😂
ferrari
What makes these 911s so freaking fast ? damn
I like Porsche a lot, but incase of exhaust point I would like to have Ferrari 812 Superfast🔥🔥
Ferrarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Finally  the signal lady
Please bring Model S with 911 Turbo S!
It's Francisco berneuli 😂😂😂
Ferrari 🔥😍
Ferrari laferrari vs mclaren p1 please!!
The 812 Superfast is the one I would go for.
Porsche!!
Now that's a proper supercar drag race! 911 Turbo S is the best value for money... but it sounds like crap 😂 SVJ is the special one from this trio ✌
Lamborghini sounds hell out of it🙄& that Porsche define silence before the storm 🤯
Aah another video with Yiannimize... another video skipped.
Ferrari: Superfast Porsche: hold mein bier.
Just when you think you've seen it all😂😂😂, that intro 😂😂😂
14 minutes early yea. Oiiii
Yanni when ferrari is pulling on him:       *Fear noises*
I actually liked his German accent 😅👌
I would take the 992 turbo s any day!
Omg everytime u make a joke it blows me how the f*ck BBC didnt take you for the top gear after Clarkson. You are sooo funny, those impressions🤣🤣🤣
Yeaaah my Porsche woooooon
Honestly, I would take the Porsche. It’s the most practical and you can buy 2 of them for the price of that lambo. Best performance in my opinion too!
Try get a Bugatti to race
Might be my fav drag race ever... Better than Tesla drag races lol
911 turbo s
Porsche 🙃
Do genesis g90 review
911 Turbo S
You tube Moooooneyyy😅😅
Ferrari!
Ferarri superfast
Porsche 911 kill any other supercar
The Porsche is quiet but super fast lol
812 looks the best
Porsche sounds best😂😬
Always 812 SF
The Porsche sounds best!
One of the best intros off the bat!
It’s boring now when Porsche is there.Just put it on the finish line already😂😂Amazing competition between SVJ and Superfast though
Funny how the Porsche won and has least amount of votes
Cheapest the fastest
Ferrari sounds best
SVJ is better
Ferrari F8 Tributo 🆚 Mclaren 720 S  🆚 Porsche 911 Turbo S Drag Race, Roll Race and Break Test
i came here  for the svj
Rolling Race exist:   Ferrari: Allow me to introduce myself.....
Ferrari
Hi Mat, can you please include the price in $ and € in your videos? Thanks!
Turbo S vs GT2RS vs GT3RS, maybe we could see the best out of these Porsche
There is the problem there are like all three of my favourite car so I can't decide it
The 911ts
That was hilarious 🤣
LIKE FOR YANNI TO GET COVID
meanwhile porsche enginneers are popping champagnes while watching this video
Matt your German accent was spot on 😭🤣
Porsche forever
The italian Fanboys are for sure not gonna like this hahah
I love the porch
Love for PORSCHE.
Porsche is a ever day car but Lamborghini is one I would for awesome sound 🤪 sorry Ferrari not a fan
I’m gonna be honest here. no matter how fast that Porsche is, I’ll still go with the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ (or even the Ferrari 812 SF) because it’s exotic and it sounds miles better than the Porsche.
5:26 lambo hp = 770+200 hp
That turbo s was like .... Its everyday bro
812 Superfast review matt come on!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Do a drag race with a 911 gt2rs
812 SUPERFAST ALL THE WAY , I ALSO HAVE TWO!!!
Yanni is such a sore loser
Porsche 911 turbo
I would have ferarri
And the turbo S probably handles better than the others
911 🚀🚀🚀
I love the Porsche. Matt can you please do a drag race bmw 335xi performance edition e90 vs audi s4 b8 vs benz c350 w204.
What's the ala system doing on that Lamborghini??
911 turbo s
Jani meeds to drop his seat as low as it can go. He’s too big for that SVJ. Has to duck to see under the roof line
Porsche sounds the best, in that it proves you don't need to sound like an obnoxious twat to go fast
R8 V10 PERFORMANCE VS 992 TURBO S VS HURACAN EVO VS SVJ
Do a drag race with an f1 car
SVJ had like 5% fuel? Ferrari had 50%? What about the Porsche? I mean that's like 40-50kg difference.
I wonder how fast 911 will get in next 10 years. It's so quick , by far has most clever Engineering, The Transmission, Stability and weight balance. I'm a Lambo fan but I'm in love with Porsche. And the most Practical supercar in this race.
PORSCHE best of best💪
871th
The Porsche
I would like to have the 812 superfast
turbo s all the way every day
porshe fan here!!
I would have 812 but the Best car is 911 and the worse is AVENTADOR)
This Porsche is just insane
My favorite car is the 812 super fast
i know the result before watching the video lool 1st must be 911 2nd svj and 3rd 812 haha
that turbo s is fast as hell
Porsche 911 turbo s i love that car
Ferrari
That porsche is quiet like ev but faster like ev to
911, proper car proper servicing and giant slayer for half the money
That's Ferrari looks 🔥🔥🔥🔥
SVJ / 720S/ 812 WOULD LOVE TO SEE THOSE
The most beautiful car here is 812...and 911 turbo s....
Porsche 911 Turbo S any day of the weak
God I love that Ferrari 812.   Edit: 100% would have that Ferrari
Wow... I really enjoyed this video. I literally scream out load cuz of the Porsche's performance. The Porsche is a gentle beast.
Of course i would have the Porsche 911 turbo s 💙🌬🔥!. Bcuz it's really really great car 🤙🏼💙
How is it even possible when comparing the stats?
Truly Carwow!
Porsche👑👑👑
That 911 is a killer 🤣
The turbo s is fast yo
Cool 👍
Ferrari is the best
Lamborghini all day everyday
Just waiting for the Porsche fans to mass into a big circle jerk.
Italian accent 9/10 German accent 10/10!!!
Is it just me or does the front of the 812 look a bit like a Dodge Viper?
THIS IS THE BEST ADVERT IVE EVER SEEN!!!!
812
If money wasn't an object, it's an easy choice for me. Ferrari all the way
Can someone get this porsche on a dyno because what???? 😂😂
Matt when you will review a koenigsegg?
SVJ 🔥🔥🔥
i would take the Turbo  put a tune on it destroy them even more and still save 100.000 k  lol
812 superfast any day
Keep up the good work
the cheaper the quickest
the 812 super is soo airodynamic
Porche sleeping giant
The Ferrari 812 Superfast all day
Think we can all agree All 3 Cars Are amazing and you would be happy with either one .
The Porsche is the fastest so i would take that one
I'd take the Ferrari, IN RED.
Wow Porsche
GERMAN ENGINEERING IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD!
porsche as always
Love ur vids
I would definitely choose to have the Lamborghini aventador svj 63
Porsche
Best drag till date
I support FERRARI FOR LIFE I mean 2 Ferrari 1 Porshe 1 Lamborghini SVJ
I'll get the Ferrari definitely
That turbo s is insane!
Ferrari ⚡️
Definitely the Lamborghini
Aventador SV vs Aventador SVJ
that svj is insanely fast it almost beat the porsche in the first race
That Porsche should be banned....🤣🤣..
Yianni jumped the first time
This porsche is doing what nissan did with the gtr 12 years ago. Took about 10 years of development till cars could compete with it again. Looks like the turbo s will be winning for a long time now 😂 cue the incoming die hard turbo s fans that will build up after its many years of terror
If Lamborghini nobody but Yini❤️
I'd have the Porsche cause it a more practical daily
That Porsche just keeps leaving me more speechless every time I watch it! Incredible car!
Porsche wasn't the race. Porsche is the Drag-KING!!!!!
After watching previous Porsche drags we're going to know that Porsche is going to win, without even watching this one.
There was only one case where I thought of any car beating the porche and that was 720s But porche did manage to beat it though
Jungs, Jungs, Jungs die Italiener klingen vielleicht gut, aber am Ende ist der Porsche einfach nicht zu schlagen. Wenn sich zwei streiten, freut sich der Dritte ;)
I liked mats ferrari hoho
812 best looking
Svj I would have
Lambo sounded the best i guess🤔
Lambo
Porsche. Love the understatement.
I’d took the Porsche for sure mate
Can we talk about that this Porsche  has the half of cylinders and about 150 horsepower less?? Its unbeliveable..
porsche
Looks: Ferrari>Porsche>Lamborghini
Porche
911 ❤️❤️❤️
Who else knew the Porsche 911 turbo s was going to win the drag race before watching this video?
I have that Ferrari      In the Crew 2😎
My guess: DRAG: Porsche, Ferrari, Lambo Rolling: Porsche, Ferrari, Lambo Braking: Porsche/Lambo real close, Ferrari last
My lord i laughed so hard when Mat strtes speaking with that italian dialect hahah
Lmao the new turbo S is terrifyingly fast😂😂😂
That ferrari v12 was made by Thor. The sound is amazing
Porsche is best,,,it's low on power as compared to those massive horse power machine
The porche 911 turbo s
Porche!
Watched the start twice and I think that Yannie cheated a little.
Ferrari superfast is not at all fast as I thought
Gotta love underdogs!
Porshe all day every day baby
Porsche - There's no substitute!
Yenni jump started 😂😅
I love Porsche alot and its seems that it is better than another two😂
Yanny 😎😎😂 I love this men
Lamborghini anyday 😍
Lamborghini svj is best
Damn son, that Porsche is absolutely insane.  It costs over 100 grand less then the italian counterparts and is faster
*We want Bugatti and Koenigsegg in the drag race*
That porche sounds kinda good doe 😳😳
4:59 A V12 Lambo sliding while bouncing at the rev limiter...  best scene ever.
I would have none
Amazing mat! You are doing drag races of the cars of great choice! Loved this drag race! Waiting for more!
Porsche for me please.
As alwys they were ignoring the Porsche like hell
A Ferrari is a Ferrari tahts what I'll have
aventador svj   all day everyday
Ferrari: 2.2 and 2.3 tire pressure?  That Is a reason why Turbo S is so quick. Obviously, with like 2.9 front, 3.6 bar rear tires i'ts set up for track and drag. A bit of cheating...
For the next drag  Devil 16 vs Bugatti veyron
Imagine being so overpowered, that you are not even considered a competition......  That Porsche really is something else.
Turbo s
Porsche forever 💪
Ofcourse 911 turbo s
Porsche everytime, love that car
Porsche 1 then I'll have ferrari 2 Lamborghini 3
Porsche: Hello guys.. . . . . . bye guys
SVJ Forever
Porsche 911 turbo S
I’d still have an SVJ any day, that thing looks like a space ship. And the sound!
Porsche!
812 with novitec exhaust is the one i would have 😍
Ferrari- Screaming  Lambo- Shouting for 2nd place Porsche- WOOOOOOOO Me first place
Lambo gang
money no object, I'll have the superfast.
Porsche is best looking lambo sounds beat!
That ferrari in that black🥵
Yianni has many Lamborghinis
Of course the ferrari 812 superfast
Porsche
I’d have the Ferrari, it is so fucking beautiful and sounds great  Plus it’s a Ferrari....
Nothing to see here bois. We all know who's going to win
Lambo all day Yianni !!!!
Порш. Самый лучший
Now 500k like just for the intro
Ferrari lol
911 all the way
These days, the quieter the car revs at idle, the quicker it launches (electrics excluded)
This was the best ass sounding drag race ever
Lamborghini 😍😍
I saw Yianny ,I CLICKED FAST !!!!
Is it just me or do those stickers make the Lambo look like Hot Wheels trash?
That hat Yianni's wearing increases 25Hp
I'd take the Porsche anytime of the day😊
Porsche 911 turbo better all round car imo
I would take the lambo
Porsche all the way 💪🏻
1st race: 5:20 2nd race: 6:59 Rolling race: 8:19 2nd rolling race: 9:36  Bonus: 4:56
Leave it to the germans to make a 6 cylender faster than a V12😂
Ferrari I would like to have
Porsche
Porsche
Like for team Porsche!🇩🇪
U should make a vid With a mansory car
Damn this is the drag race i have wanted for ages !!!
Porsche 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Porsche all day long
That Porsche is just worth it!
that lambo colour was so beautiful😍
Defo 812
Superfast. Red. Carbon wheels.
I LOVE the porsche... its that gentleman that knows he doesnt need to cost as much as two houses and doesnt have to wake up everyone by driving past but is still the fastest... what a car
If the Ferrari is Superfast The Porche is Toofast
That ferrari is a beast on the rolling race
Next weeks drag - 720s Vs 812 Vs SVJ?
812 superfast😍
I’d have the 812
The ending of the second drag race had me in bits. 🤣
I love that porsche
I love how during whole drag race Yanni keeps looking only to the left lol.
Porsche any day 😂
That lambo gearbox sounds ancient now
Lol the Porsche is the ultimate driving machine.
LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR SVJ IS THE BEST
I would have the porch
Lambos are really quick but the only prob with it is they only have single clutch
LAMBORGHINI AVENTADOR SVJ IS THE BEST
Porsche without soft limiter
The Porsche is wicked!
Porsche 💪🏻
The Porsche
Saw the starter lady the first time ever. My life is complete.
What is up with that Porsche 😱
I would rather have a Mercedes G63 6×6 than those 3 cars
Damn, that German car literally destroys whoever it is every single time
Matt's Italian accent is on point ngl.
Porsche is just too good
Great video ☺️👍 I think that we could predict by now the results of the Rolling races, since the difference between the "comfort" and "sport"  modes in the Italian cars (even if Lamborghini is...😏😜) And I would personally go for the Porsche (better bang for your bucks) 😎
The accent idea is good, wish every vid is like that
Wait for the German Mercedes project one
Lambo
Lamborghini svj i would have
Lamborghini is just expensive slow car
If the Ferrari was lighter and all wheel drive it would easily win over the lambo.
I would have the 812 superfast because as an Italian i should use a cultural icon...     Its also hilariously fun
Although the Porsche sounds bad, it won a £360000 car 😂
The porsche won the sound check clearly!
Carwow's drag race is better than all the fast and furious movies combined.         In terms of drag race
More SVJ races plz...
812
Alright we need a turbo s Vs Ferrari f8 Vs Lamborghini hurucan Evo who agrees?
😂😂Yanni just hates loosing
your accent is racist its that bad
812 it is more practical
Ferrari 812
No Matt your accent is still British...
That 812 spec is 😍🤩😍🤩
Ferrari looks the best
I would have got the Porsche.
Ferrari exhaust: great   Lamborghini exhaust: perfect    Porsche: 😷
I thought the accents weren't too bad. Haha
11 mins in
Why didn't you take the f8 ... The 812 is more of a gt car , can't compare it to an svj
MATT 918 spyder vs new 911 turbo s let’s see if it can beat its older more powerful brother I think it has a good chance
If money isn’t a problemo then it’s the 812! Or else 911
That porche Jesus omgggggggg
That porsche is a tough one to many supercars...
That Porker is amazing!
Porsche 911 turbo s
Ferrari
Best drag race ever
the best drag race yet 👌👌
Lambo all day
Where is the McLaren 720s
Lamborghini jumped the start
The Italians are known for not giving the most accurate stats for weight. Motortrend weighted both test cars they received. The 812 was 3845lbs(1744kg) and the SVJ 3902lbs(1769kg).
Porsche killed the Italian brands
Man, that single clutch really holds the Lambo back.
The Lamborghini starts early, not right 😉
Lamborghini king is back that's Yanni
Yea finally got to see the lady's face😀
Wow incredible
This Porsche is sick😛
Now I'm convinced.  I need a Porsche in my life.
Really looking forward to seeing your first car under 10s
For a silent car, the Porche sure does the business on the track (always) 😂😂
911 turbo S
Why does Yanni ALWAYS jump the line ????
YANNI IS BACK IN THE LAMBORGHINI
That Porsche is bonkers fast ⚡⚡
CARs WOW 😄😄😄😯
Porsche ♥♥♥
WTF That Porsche just...WOW
I'm so excited to see this drag race and especially yianni driving that Lamborghini
Accents were great Mat! 😂
Mamma mia your italian is very good marcello😂
Yianni+Lamborghini = I'm Happy.
Damn the porshe is killing it
EVERYONE WANTS A CHIRON DRAG RACE
What type of language was that mat😃
Waiting impatiently for an ホンダ NSX introduction...
Porsche is just too good
HP: 812 > SVJ > 992TS WIN: 992TS..     WTF??????????????????????
When your one of the first ones and everyone’s commenting “first”
F in the chat for yianni
If that Porsche has 750 hp, he'd be gone in seconds beating the two italians by a huge margin
That Ferrari did pretty well considering its weight and that it's RWD and more made for touring rather then outright speed, probably reason why it did so good in rolling race.  But that SVJ just sound godly.  Also, Porsche 1/4 time is just insane, no other way to put it lol.
CS Panda *21 subscribers* Also CS Panda *buys one of the most expensive cars in the world*
Lambo sounds better
Porsche. Probably the easiest to live with as a daily.
The Porsche sounded the best                   For fuckin millenials that is😁😁
Both obliterated by the porsche...      Well, I'm going to pretend I didn't see that.
Let's be honest, nobody asked for this race, but everyone is super excited.
That Porsche is insanely Awesome.❤️❤️. Loved it.  Also that Lambo and Ferrari were beautiful
How dahell is Porsche fast even if it's less in power
I love how it says for me that the video came out 4 minutes ago and the comments are all 8 minutes old
Tnx for svj
FERRARI BEST CAR
Nothing beats that Turbo S
Mats channel is so consistent with its uploads omg
First
As ridiculous as this is to say, these sort of races make the porsche look like the bargain of the century!!
Whenever I see Yianni. I shout “YEESSSSSSSSS”
🔥🔥🙏🏼🙏🏼
I fucking love this channel!?!?!
Lamborghini svj is my Dream car 😍😍
Ferrari 812
I've been waiting for this
I think its a draw between the Lambo and the Ferrari(the sound test).
Love from India 🇮🇳
The gearbox In the Lamborghini really lets it down
Turbo S !!!!!!!!!
i thought this was their italian channel or something
Best cars in one drag race!😍
That Ferrari is easily the nicest looking 😍
lambo definitely
Wow that Porsche 🤯
That dutch accent was incredible!
That porsche is such an insane piece of engineering, very impressive
Yianni is well funny. He is like an overexcited bear
Yanni jumping the start as always but this Porsche tho... best car on Earth without a doubt! Damn how good it is...
It just boggles my mind how Porsche manufactures cars with 150 HP less than other supercars, yet win the dragraces. Porsche is something else, incomparable to any other brand.
The ferrari sounds the best for sure👌
The Porsche is something special.
Why is everyone jumping the start??
Italian accent pretty good 😂
What the fuck is in that Porsche
I'll rather take the slower lambo than the faster 911
One of the best drag races ever!!
Carwow girl is hot. Thanks for all the race starts. We appreciate, I hope she reads this.
911
As soon as i see Lamborghini, its obvious its yanni
Talk like this more
Lets be honest we all wanted the Porsche to still be the champion against these super supercars, and of course it won
The SVJ is such a beautiful car 😍🔥👌
if the porsche turbo s gets beaten, get the GT2RS in there and porsche is back on top
can we get a race with the bmw m5 e60 and the new f90 m5?
The superfast and the turbo s can also be comfortable and relaxing on the road, the lambo is way to stiff.  Therefore I would take the 812 because of looks, speed and the best sound
Yanni sure did JUMP that start in the first race!!
Porsche 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Somebody flipped the start maybe
Matt: being offensive but funny
How is the Porsche faster though 😥😓
I love how they didn’t even care about beating the Porsche they knew what that thing is
Carwow upload this vid: Me: I DONT NEED SLEEP I NEED ANSWER
812 BEST SOUND EVER
Fun fact: no one has completely seen the video yet
SHOW THE TURBO S RESPECT !
Is the lambo weight including yanny?
In the standard mode porsche won, don't give it to ferrari
156000 euro German Car break  Lamborghini and Ferrari German car its the best 😆
Turbo s demolition
When Yianni said come on, then uh oh, I was dead
lolz
Matt you cheated
My goodness that Porsche is fast. All that from a six cylinder. Astonishing car, astonishing engineering.
wheres the idrive
It all fun  until Ferrari joins the race
Who wants to see Mat vs Yianny  100m sprinting?!   Everybody Horse is good, nooo Bull is better.  Horses looking like deers  in the back: pathetic...
0:00 🤣🤣🤣
Porsche boy always 😎
Germany #1
That was soooo tense!
Sound Test... the porsche really fucked up hahahhaha
If its a Lamborghini, it could be only one person 😂😂😂😂😂😂🔥🔥
Lamborghini my dream car
That porsche is disgustingly composed.🤣
Porsche was brilliant
Do German people really sound like that, when they're talking English? 😂
Sometimes if you turn off traction control you can really rev cars out.
As much as I love the 812superfast, the 911turbo S will win,  Sound, DEFINITELY THE 812!!!💔  Buy, both Porsche and Ferrari
I need £156,000
Money no object i prefer the ferrari because the lambo svj is gross😬😬
SVJ…
That Ferrari is pretty slow at launch
Open the valt on the Porsche
The Porsche sounds so ridiculously bad.
Yianny jumped the line in the first drag race!!!!!!!!!!!!! CHEATER
I like Yianni. He always cheating xD
Mat is is a good mood today
Holy Porsche ! 🔥
Rip The Race Starter.....
The Porsche definitely sounds the best.
Oh my god, Porsche have built a monster. It destroyed a Lamborghini svj v12 and a 812 super fast v12 with its v6 in the drag 😱.
Ferrari be like: we are a proud Italian brand Also Ferrari: names their car superfast
matt car
Porsche 911 Turbo is literally the quiet kid
Lambo jumped the start
For once Ferrari is cheaper than Lamborghini
One of my Favourite drag race
You had me at the intro, greatt-e performan-cee jààà
Ferrari is best
Yianni
Ferrari SF90 and Porsche 992 Turbo S are as fast as NA cars are going to get. Want faster, go electric
Why didn't the porsche warm up the tires... And what happened with yani saying Lamborghini all day lol
The unholy trinity🔥🔥
I knew yanni was there lambo guy
I thought something was wrong with YouTube with that intro
Even tho the Porsche wasn’t red      *it still won*
It's unfair to have that ferrari there, they needed a 488 or something like taht
He never lets anyone drive this car...     Lets go all tokyo drift on it.
THAT TURBO S IS A BEAST!
Porsche it is, easy 😅
♥️👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 janjakhrojan1989@gmail.com
Drag race at 5:20

Spoiler Alert: The Porsche won.  But it wasn't there in the race actually it was between just Mat and Yianni
Awesome drag race but im missing Mclaren 720s here 😉 im sure if you race 720s against these cars Mclaren definitely wins

Omg my God that Porsche just flies🤩
Ferrari 812 Superfast all the way for me

The Italian accent was spot on!!!😂
The Italian voice is immaculate 😂
porsche sounds the best
If there's a Lambo in the video there's a Yianni in the race
i love that Italian accent xD
SVJ IS THE BEST AND MY DREAM CAR

Porches are over achieving!!!!🔥
R.I.P Chadwick boseman 💔💔💔

That Italian accent of mat aches my soul :(
0:59 everybody is gangsta until yianni shows up in Aventador SVJ.
That 812 looks epic in black. Very menacing.
The italian and the german accents 😂😂😂
The daddy, 911 Turbo S will win it! EDIT: IT DID!
How many of you knew the instant when you saw the lambo that yanni will be there in today's video

Hahahahahahaha that opening. I can’t hold myself 😂 ❤️ 🙏
What an Intro!!! Superb!!! The video we all have been waiting for. You should have thrown in the 720 S  just for fun...
I couldn’t sleep and as soon as I pick up my phone , carwow uploads, perfect.
That Ferrari is absolutely mint
Who is that guy blabbing nonsense In the Ferrari?😂
If it's a Lambo its Yanni

Porsche is a winner
That Ferrari looks so nice
All of them are Masterpieces! Aventado SVJ looks like a spaceship, 992 Turbo s is so insane too!

Every time i saw lambo , YIANNI pops in my mind
Laser bro!
Me:Man I'm getting bored... YouTube notification: say no more Edit:- why don't you guys just have a running race... Wait... No one... Yannie: come on.... .... I'd like to have McLaren 720s..... that thing has a bad habit of overtaking ......
Lol 😂
Amazing race...🏎️💯
Finally , the good content to watch
Loving the accents mat 😅
His accents are on point 😂
Hello, Carwow. It's nice to see your videos again
During the first few seconds I thought I'm at the wrong channel
His Italian accent actually wasn't that bad😂
Yeayyy Im early
Porshe gonna smoke these things, because Germany. Edit: Ok that SVJ is a lot faster than I thought. If that thing had a dial clutch gearbox it would be a monster. The Aventador replacement should be a monster.
wow
🤩
Can we all just appreciate Matts attempt at an Italian accent ? Haha well done Matt we still love you. That SVJ looks insane!
Okay Italian!?!?!
Yea na that accent thing was a bit weird
Very early
My dream race
