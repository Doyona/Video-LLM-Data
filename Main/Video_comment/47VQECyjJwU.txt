What rod does Carl use for stalking?
Good job 😊
Alex was chatting a load of Bhah Bhah Bhah when he wen't on about the sheep Lol.
Hi Carl I’m just getting into carp  fishing and I’m wondering what rod to get im also on a budget do you have any recommendations?
Carl what is the biggest species of fish you have lost?
Love these vids keep it up
You guys got me in to fishing i got over 60 cap so thank you
Wow
Awesome guys .. well nice place … awesome old mirror .. cheers Chris & Sam
In polish tanch is lin
I go fishing at the lake that kaddy took you to all the time but I never catch any carp what bait did you use
How big is it
We have a not so secret pond near my house and my grandad first took me as a child I will always remember it. Well for the past two years I've been taking my son and he has had some lovely fish up to 20lb. It's a very old pond over 100 years old and every carp looks different from silver looking commons to jet black . Will always be my favourite pond for the memories alone and can't wait for the day I'll get to take my grandchildren on their first fishing trip to the same spot
charlies lake ashford? awesome content By the way!
Great job like always guys and girl👊😉
love ur vids
Great watching youtwo its ash the profile pik im yousing is my little brother billy cant wayt to go fishing if god permits it has anyone got any old tackle to donate  to me mine got pinched and most of the tackle wasent mine it was my mum who passed away last month
U can actually see the fish in the thumb nail
What pond is it
hello carl and alex i want to buy amything in your store but i cant because im from germany is there any way ?
Are you guys a member of Crowborough angling club, if you are try Oast farm lake the carp are the size of sharks!
What is the rod holder called
You gise are so funny and I love your videos I've watched all of your videos
Alex throwing a stick being cool and then it gets mixed-up with sheep’s representing B-tain LOL 😂 he was taken
Great video as usual lads smashing it !x
My man did not notice the camera 4:01
When Alex is trying to explain about the sheep...I think he just needed a good couple of nights sleep 😁😁....hi from down under
Another top video lads 🎣🎣🎣
Just shows if you give out positivity then you get it back.. look at your comments section
Really beautiful to see a nice almost fully scaleless mirror carp! Makes me think back to Victorian times when those fish would've been common-place due to the selective breeding which caused them. It's genetics probably make it out to be a true 'heirloom' mirror carp.
Were is location
what alarms are they?
Quite the fishing(ahem 16:40 ish) trip.
A 🦡 🦡🦡 🦡 🦡 🦡 🦡🦡 🦡 🦡  🍄 ALEX ALEX  🍄
Your perch grow to 2 to 3 times the size of ours here in Canada. Lucky son of a gun
The girlfriend has more muscle and body than the two of you combined, boys.
brilliant guys @TheCarpCatcher
wish you guys would give weight more
Your videos are stunning. Beautifully put together.
australian people thinking. “30°C??? that’s cold!!!!!”
Another great video. Thought Alex was great dolng his david Bellamy bit with the carrots 🥕 lol did make me chuckle. You lot fish in some stunning picturesque places!!! Thanks
When that guy got in the way of the camera😂😂😂
Always entertaining guys thank you
First time watching any of your videos. Enjoyed this a lot. Could I ask what is the lake you were fishing where the carp jumped into the net?
I entered the Korda competition and won and coming out with Karl and Alex next year👍🏻
Great 👍🏻 thanks fellas .   If I may make a suggestion ....you guys should head up north to my home country of Scotland 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿. There are a few lochs that are famous for ferox   Trout Loch Awe And Loch Earn .....they are true monsters ! Incredible size .  I reckon it would make for an awesome episode ..just a thought ..take care and tight lines 👍🏻
This channel just keeps getting better thanks fellas
Fantastic video as always. You lads present the best fishing adventures since the passion for angling episodes. Brilliant 👍🏼
30c mate out here in country nsw Australia we get 40c to 45c for like weeks
Why leave the fish u cought til next vid why don't you just show it dam not everyone's gonna sit there m watch every vid 🤦‍♂️
Fishing is rude It is not good for the animals
Don't come to Australia 40°c
Your fishing is so good. You are both fabulous at editing and definitely my favourite youtubers!
Great vid. A massive carp, a triple carrot and a eulogy about sheep. What more can one ask? 🤩
That fellor that walked on front of the camera and was like.. Ohhh sheeettt take it back now yall 😂
great - as always!!! :-)
Another nice vid 👏🏻🔥 Your dedication to producing quality easy to watch vids makes this one of the best fishing channels keep up the good work
Go back and try to catch those trout, by the way love the videos.
4:02 hello man 4:03 bye bye man
Wheres the pike muskie bass perch walleye trout? Such garbage fish
What reel is Carl using?
Manure makes curly carrots. They like plain soil.
It gets to 30 degrees every day and even in winter in Zimbabwe
I love it how you handle your fish you do very well My boy loves you
Big perch in the UK are small here in the Netherlands :P
LIFE JACKETS!!!!!!!!!
Well done guys lovely fish 🎣
大きいコイですね。It's a big carp
Where do you find these locations?  They look amazing!
This video screams liberty and happiness on all levels especially when Alex tripping over the sheep hahaha
There are some massive carp in Milton Keynes at Bradwell Lake
Hi going round all ur vids love them!!!
Always love watching fishing, but above all, the care for the fish while out of the water is truly something.  Ensuring those big boys will continue to grow larger.  Good on you both.
Great to see you guys catch some Nile Perch!
i think at this point you should add omi to the name of the channel, she has appeared in a lot of your videos since you first met her, so i think it's time to add a name to the channel
Top quality production
New to your channel.  Absolutely love it. I enjoy fishing myself, but also appreciate their beauty.
Hi guys, is it possible to show your rig set up for carp?
Not being rude but I really wan you guys to upload you are my favourite youtubers and I check every day if you have uploaded
That cast with that bread though 👌
Like frendd
Getting into a boat without a life jacket is pretty damn idiotic, and you've done this repeatedly on several videos. Setting a bad example here lads.
I just bumped into Alex at a coastal venue which I won’t mention as I understand Carl doesn’t know where he is and is off filming somewhere else😉. Charming chap, a bit shocked to be recognised and taller than I expected. Keep up the great videos gents. You rock 😎
I didn't do much fishing this year but next year going to be a good fishing year 4me
Hey guys have a good place you might like to try fishing it’s called Morecambe you can get amazing thorn back rays on the beach also cod at the right time of year
Hi guys there is a lake behind my house that has proper big carp and just need to know how do you think I can catch them
You probably not going to reply but have you fished in Liverpool and if so can you show us it love vids keep it up
Hi carl and alex i was wondering if you could do merch for people that are not on patreon?

hey can i ask where did u buy that rain shild that u sleep in and how much it coast?
Have u ever caught a mirror koifish I did
Marry her dammet!!!
What would be the best way to bait up a private lake that has only been fished twice in around 100 years. Good sized Carp were caught last time which was 8 years ago. Have been given permission to fish there it but not sure where to start when it comes to unfished waters!
I love you guys and you are my idol and I look up to you
Good to see carl get the big one this time
Well done guys , keys rings look great
Great video as always nice one
Them tench look like a small mouth bass had baby with a carp and thats what came out .that green with red eyes
Are you and omi still together? Would love to see another video together
Nice video guy’s
Where is it
You guys continue to excell.
Absolutely off his cake 😂
HOW DO YOU CACH CARP IN WINTER WAT IS THE BEST BAIT CARL AND ALIX
YOUR THE BEST  YOUTOBERS AND YOUR MY FAROT
You guys are just smashing it every-single-time; thnx for all the content. Keep it up guys.
If u want to catch some nice bass go to Albert falls dam in South Africa, they got loads over 12 pounds
When will we see a new video on the koi pond and the aquarium?
great stuff, nice old mirror in the end, well done ..
You guys are such a filming inspiration that was sick! So happy to see Carl catching them! You’ll get them next time Alex!
I love watching you guys catch fish
Cool video bro loved it 👍❤️
נהנה מאוד מין הערוץ שלכם .ומעריץ גדול גם שלכם אין עלכים אלופים תמשיכו כך .ואמון דייג מוצלח ממני סיימון...👍👏👍❤🤗🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🐟🤗
Great video chaps, love fishing wild ponds like this.
Holy Mackerel is the god of fish 😁
Carl and alex, when do u think ur goin to retire from fishing?
Here in the states we don’t pursue these fish like this. I’m a bass angler. I sub to you a long time ago when jon b came fishing with y’all the first time! I love watching how big of a sport this type of fishing is in other countries. It inspires me to try carp fishing. I’m only a bass angler but i will defiantly try carp soon!
4:03 that dude thought he was disturbing the shot poor guy
Where was the small grass carp pond ?
You guys are different class
So glad to see omie (hope I spelt that right) again. Great job as always thank you.
Can't say I've ever seen an airborne carp before.
always a pleasure to watch u fishing the sweet spots, amazing camera work capturing the scenery, been watching your channel develop over the years & brings back my childhood memories fishing, thanks C & A
Carrots grow that way when the ground is to firm for them, if you use a much more sandy soil they will grow long and straight! Also amazing videos guys. Love it
Alex finally found the mushrooms he was looking for
4:01 lol
Hey did you know that Jesus loves you?! and He is very real and he died on the cross for your sins!
how stoned do u have to get lost in the sheep HAHA  u guys are awesome
How many eaten biscuits did it take to catch it this time?
What a common at the start!!
Carl thats a monster bud nice done💪
Alex needs to talk to frank about his mushroom dependence.🤣 Great video as always.
Radiation in the soil does stuff like that😃😃
hello may i know where did u get the fishing indicators from?
I know what your bro means about the sheep... 👍 ✌️
Your fishing was too good, you caught beautiful fish congratulations, you are a great fisherman.👍🎣
like if you would buy Carl and Alex merch
Alex do you have Welsh blood? Or have you being making your own shroom?
Awesome Video 😍😍
Love ur channel ---- stay safe out there Thanks for the great videos #peacelovehealthnhappines
Not so secret anymore 🤣🤣
It's not a mystery fish... you always fish carp :P
the more nutrients in your soil the weirder carrots grow
You should not ridicule your brother. Alex was correct when he said that the sheep was symbolic, The Lord Chancellor sat on 'The Woolsack'. Named for the fact that in medieval times, the nation's wealth was founded on the woollen industry and sheep farming and Edward 111 ordered that the Lord Chancellor literally sat on a wool-bale in recognition of that fact. Today it's the seat of the Speaker of the House of Lords. (End of lesson)  Another class video.
Cook
It's a video about fish and sheeps.
Fantastic content as usual! Some beautiful carp in this video.
Where is the river you visit around 15 mins in for the carp if you don't mind saying?
Love your video's, been watching them for the last year or so. Can't find and place else to request this but would love to know a list of your rod's and reels you use. Tried looking in your about page thinking it might be listed in there. Thanks
10:00 I've fished that lake! That's where I caught my first crucian.
I'm Welsh, and sheep may be symbiotic with Welshness these days, but they are not native fauna! They're more of a plague.
carl and alex, what program do you use to edit your amazing videos
Hey guys. I have just signed up to your  patreon page. Keep up the great work.
What camera do you use to record with please? 🤔
How is this on trending lol
Another great video lads 👍🏻  can’t find the link you mentioned in it though
Great video. Beautiful.
I like the fact that the ponds lakes and rivers in the U. K. Are left mostly wild around the shore or margins. As you say. Here in the U.S.A. most are cut back.
Hi i think what u catch 10 min its not carp but all video 100%
there's a lake by my dads house I have been fishing since 1970. I fish it a couple times a week now days but back in the 80-90's every single day. I caught everything possible and taught hundreds of people for fish over the years. BARE WITH ME - about ten years back, this man and his son walk up to me while I was fly fishing it. He said, "I can't believe you still fish this lake" I asked if I knew him, he said yes but as a 7 year old kid with a bucket asking for baby bass and bluegil for his dads pond. His dad was a DR. and built a mansion right off the lake. In the back yard, he built a series of pools from the size of a pool table to the size of roughly 20' x 30' and a waterfall filtration system connection g them all. From the big pond the water was filtered and sent back to the top over the waterfall ladders. He raised minnows and tad poles in the small, then bluegill and baby bass in pool 2, then as the bass got about 10" they went to pool 3, pool 3 was bass from 1 pound to 3 pounds and channel and bullhead catfish. pool 4 was bass 3 pounds to 8 pounds. After the fish outdrew the ponds, he walked them over to the lake and put them in. He also had a separate one for crawdads. Any way, he told (his son) "I want you to shake hands with the man who taught your dad to fish" It was so cool! Full circle. His dad never had time for him as a kid due to his career and saving peoples lives, then, when he DID have time, his son had grown and moved away to start his own family. Now, back visiting his parents, our paths crossed one more time. Fishing has given me a full life, full of memories, friends, laughture, excitement and dreams. I see me and my old fishing buddy in you two guys. Your videos bring me much joy in life. I still get around, still fish both fresh and salt, spinning and fly rods. Cheers guys, drink it all in deeply. In your older days, you can relive it through the guys you passed it onto. Alan in CA.
Your fishing was incredible, that first fish you caught is beautiful, you are a great fisherman, congratulations. Hug!!!!!👍🎣🐟😎
Epic carp! Love your guys' videos!
We're a hobby. 👍👍👍
I'm no coarse angler,but I do love your 'stuff' ! Some cracking fish there,and great footage too.
Great video! Loved it lads.  I have Jst started fishing and I caught 2 x 12lb mirrors on Saturday with one of your rigs from the tutorials. Mint ! 😎👌🏻 Hope to catch bigger ones in future, keep up great work on this channel
Of course there's a God of fish !!
Alex has been eating mushrooms again at 17 minutes 😂 🐑
Superb, as always! Can’t wait to snag me one of them key rings! 🤗
Wooow really nice pond again! I need to come to the UK sometimes.😉
Where exactly do u guys fish. Are u ever n Somerset?
The God of fish is also the God of everything else, JESUS CHRIST
Well done lads.. I don't even do carp fishing but love watching your videos... What editing programmes do you use mate? Cheers
Did Alex have some strange mushrooms to do that documentary on the sheep 🐑.  Made me laugh!!!
hi Carl and Alex, another great video!!! with a lil Alex humor? rambling? idk but was funny, Hey those were AWESOME posters, great quality!! be safe boys, thank you, your friend in the states, bill
Amazing video lads! These little adventures to secret lakes make for some great content. It's getting quite cold now, I myself will have one last cast for the carp in this coming week but I've just recently tided up my spinning rod tackle for exciting pike adventures. Truth be told, it's probably my favorite type of fishing 🤭🤐🤫
Nice one, thanks for sharing ;)
16:14 stay off the magic mushrooms haha. surely!
The video is amazing
I’m a big fan Carl and Alex
Why did you change from your original fishing club to another one for more money
Wow that mirror at the end 😍
those shrooms are taking effect Alex :)
Alex smashed off his head at 16.14 Hahahahaha
Another super good video. Keep it up!
Great fish - Amazing photography - videography - Brill sound tracks - and great narration as always - you guys are an inspirational. Wow factor.
I wonder how many tick bites you get per season because you guys seem to fish lot of places with tall grass.
Anyone else see the man at 4:02 get in the camera veiwers and apologise and whent out 😂
OMG there was a mystery fish in a secret pond? 😂, who knew🤷🏼‍♂️😂
TwoTwins ?
Hey carl and alex is that Forrest lake where your girlfriend caught the carp on M.O.D ground on an estate that starts with a p. If so thats my favourite place to go fishing in the world ever !!!! I swear i recognise it let me no cheers mate love the channel
just signed up to be a patreon guys, im an avid watcher of ya vids and it feels great to give something back to u both. its a small price to pay for the hours of enjoyment i get from watching the vids. thanks both xx
Funny video gents, I have started with donations, watched you pair of muppets for years now 😂😂. Always give me inspiration to go fishing, even after the thumb fusion surgery I have just had thanks and keep danglerling 👍👍
That cast at 10:10 though 👌
nice fish Carl
The best channel I watch
Those fish from the secret pond were prob older than the lads fishing for them. Lucky boys! 👌
Nice one guys!
Why did Alex turn into Smeagle when talking about sheep 😂
Great video and if you need a hand when you are building the new koi pond I would be happy to help
far out that sturgeon! haha so tame as
hi carl and alex i go fishing in the us and catch thirty pound commons that fight super hard in the susquehanna river was wondering if you guys would like to come sometime my instagram is @bobthesaucegod if you want to contact me!
What do you guys think is a good carp bait in Chicago lake Michigan
lol.. grass carp are strange things.. was 43C in the desert today .. didn't see any grass carp today, though I usually do... some great fishing for you gents and the lady.. awesome footage as always, some of the best I have ever seen anywhere...
Symbolic things....what mushrooms u been eating this time lol
A ram has shambolics not a sheep
Did i hear/see you were planning on bringing out some Hoodies or did i just dream that
Are these carp any good to eat?
Just wondering why use never weigh your fish you catch, maybe use do but never say on camera. Not important like just wondering that's all keep up the good work guys 😎
Yes lads! You still playing darts?
Great vid as always boys love watching them keep up the good work and ill look foward to the next one
i'm in the us and finding have been looking for the gear these guys use for about a year now.. can i get some links?
Ive been watchin yall almost a year now. This is the 1st time i know the difference between Carl and Alex lol
2 observations:  1: i am from a country with grass carp of amazing proportions and sizes, but i have never seen a more beautiful grass carp in my life.  2: your wisteria (lilac) is out of this world. certainly making your pond area a magical place.  nice video again boys.
Top vid, get of the shrooms Alex 🤣
Alex - if Trump doesn't pull through have you considered running for President of the US? Your honest, touching, eloquent, analysis of the whole sheep situation was fascinating & certainly an improvement on the current incumbent.
carl and alex cribs. i like it hahaha.
Where was this filmed ?
Love these vid please do more and a pike video on fly fishing (fly fish for 20+lb pike) thank you 🙏🙏🙏
You have inspired me with fishing thank you so much
Why don’t you weigh the carp you catch or do you like us to try and guess for ourselves?
16:30 is Alex high??🤣🤣
Hi guys, great film. Just remember if your in a boat you should always have a life jacket or buoyancy aid on. Lots of very capable anglers have lost their lives by not wearing one. No fish is worth your life. 👍🎣
16:16 mushrooms really did change u for the better lol...
what bait do u use on most lakes to catch carp guessing boilies but you never know also what rods do u use really want to know
How big was the last carp you caught ? And Charlie the chagoi ? Love the content keep it up ❤️
I love this channel so so much especially with my autism I find it so nice to be able to get back from school and watch you video wether  they are from seven years ago or one of your newest videos. You have inspired me to take my fishing to the next level and make me understand that I’m just the weird boy at my school that like fishing. Thanks Carl and Alex you truly are the best YouTube channel.
I would have kept the tench as a pet and named it Judi Tench.
You two are proper filmmakers. Don’t ever doubt it.
Awesome vid dudes!!🤘🎣
Back on form
You guys are my favorite fishing channel
Alex has been eating to many mushrooms 👀😂
Can't believe you have been with your girlfriend 2 year's and she hasn't fed you up😜
Wow! What fish s that! Love u
Guys please tell us the weights that you catch. The last one looked about 26Lbs but you never say.
Lads how do I get the merch?
Symbolic's on that sheep, I'm surprised he can walk
Has my man done his eyebrows lol
Alex the sheep section was that post mushrooms?????????????
Nice place and nice fish making  me jealous happy hunting🐟🐟🐟👍✌
Hi guys thank you  for your fishing videos without your tutorials I wouldn't even know how to fish also you might have seen my friend commented on this video, but me and him are making a channel like you  called Tom and Alex. Anyway I appreciate all your videos and one question, When it's very weedy for Pike what lure shall I use?
Been watching for a while.  cracking pair of fisherman 💯
You guys got me back into fishing and im so thankful, ive caught over 50 carp in the last couple months and will be doing a charity match for an ill child in November. Your fishing tutorials are really informative and useful. You’re both awesome 😎
Merch lookin good lads 👍 some beautiful fish and stunning locations, top job fellas 👊
Cracking video boys just watched it on the bank with my son he’s just beat his pb with a stunning common of 14lb
I think Alex has been eating the wrong mushrooms xD
We would really like to see what tackle and stuff you use eg bivvys and rods great video guys
I love your chanel
Great video Boyzz , the fish were amazing and your gear is spot on. Gonna have to find your tutorial on gear set up. ML&Aloha Your Boy Kekoa&Ohana.🤙🏽🤙🏽🐗💨💨💨💨🍺🍺🍺🍺Cheers Boys!
Love watching your videos top you tube channel top video just please if you're going in Canoes or boats get a life jacket on 👍
Not a mushroom in sight! Great stuff lads. :-)
always look at new vids guys. amazing as always. keep up the great work.
Do Carl and Alex fish medic the carp ?
Can't wait to see the new koi pond in amongst Alex's orgy of vegetables 🤣👌
I look forward to seeing your videos so much this one again fantastic fun to watch video keep up the amazing work 👍👍
What a way to start my Saturday, a video from you clowns. Just waking in the states, as I work nights. Let's see what ya'll come up with. Love your work, keep em coming.
If this was the first ever video I watched on your channel I would have said it was epic and I would be raving about it.  I have been spoiled however as I have seen a lot of your previous excellent videos and as a result I was eagerly looking forward to watching this your latest content.  Whilst I did enjoy it, I thought it fell short of how much I usually enjoy your work.  For me, and I'm sure I will be in a minority, there were far too many montages of sessions you have done, which whilst interesting to watch, it left me feeling a little disappointed compared to my previous watched content.  For me (again, I'm sure I will be in a minority), each of the sessions would have been great content in their own right, especially if put together like your other recent content.  One side shoot would have been fine and engaging, I just feel like it was a 'best bits compilations video of which your above and different to other channels in my view.    That said, I did enjoy it, and it is as usual a pleasure to watch, love the bond you guys have and look forward to seeing more from you both.... tight lines!
Awsome video boys 👍🏼👍🏼
Great video lads you need to name that big mirror “Epic”, lol. Don’t ever take Alex to New Zealand or Australia as he would lose his mind as their sheep numbers are  whey more than ours lol.
where are you guys
How can I purchase the stickers lads😀?
Tip: It's easier to catch a grasscarp with a pop-up and a corn or with a pop-up.
dinsmores super soft shot, best splitshots^^ one can use them again and again.
Love your vids
I love this viedo bro
You should show us the tackle more often👍👌🎉
Just got back from some trout fishing, my dad got a trout but I only got a couple small smallmouth bass. It's getting mighty cold here in the mornings so i think the days of carp fishing are coming to an end.
Hi Carl hi Alex, love the channel has inspired me and my brother to go out fishing and we have fallen in love with it, thanks for the content. Keep it up 😁
What rod stand do you use
I’m happy that your koi shares a name with me
Your soil may have some old rocks and roots inside which makes the carrots split when growing. Hope that helps lads!
Love these carp videos
hello Carl and Alex love your videos thank for all the entertainment :]
Top video well done lads ! Keep it up
ahah i thought he caught the dog lmao
Lets goooooooooo
Just chilling watching this for the second time😂
The quality of your guy's videos never disappoint
those new guru N gauge rods are just the best ever rod i have used through action is the best on market and rod is so forgiven am i right carl and alex
Any chance of a “how to play a fish in the dark/at night” tutorial? Good vid
Have you ever fished at farlows ? Would be good to do a video there Great video btw
I love your channel and have been watching all through lockdown as a 12 year old you have inspired me to catch fish
Came across you guys via the Thinking Tackle podcast. First video I’ve watched. Like what you guys do. Pretty cool, pretty geeky. Love it. Well done guys 👏🏼
Got the poster in the mail! Appreciate it!
The mystery fish is a sturgeon
All Jokes Aside would like the MTV crib part as a full video. What you take on trips and what you carry.
Another great vid from you guys
which subscription would get me a keyring? I'll sign up as soon as I know!
I don't fish myself but this is super interesting, must be exiting when reeling in and not knowing that it could be a really special catch
Alex: ....and that is why sheep are....symbolic to the English countryside! Carl: Ah huh...ok kiddies, DON'T do mushrooms!
<3
You guys should do another catfishing. video
Great video chaps. I’ve had my beady eye on Charlie’s lake for a while now. Just need to pull my finger out and book early for it. 🐟
Had to get the patreon😁
Greetings from Germany! You guys are so great. You changed my life with your videos. Thank you for that!
I just joined your patreon🤪
You should come to my normal fishing lake it’s manmade and holds carp up to thirty pounds          There’s catfish and carp.
You guys are really good like watching a tv show. Why your only 200k subs I’ve no clue  Spend some cash on advertising I think your channel would boom 💥  Subbed and shared
One day you will meet that awesome God. Hopefully you would have accepted Him before you meet Him
Carl and Alex at 16.00 you wouldn’t of happened to of smoked a sly dooby by any chance 😂😂
Would you guys ever go back to tanyard fishery for a video
That flick cast @ 1min 50secs Alex. Styling it out.
Loved the video!!
Good to see you've got your mojo back Carl. Really like the variety in this video and it's nice to see Omi back, and catching off the top too.
Been watching you guys for years how do you join patreon lads would be a pleasure to support you guys
Time to become Religious Lads as its what Covid is all about.. Getting The Mark of the Beast in you and condeming you to Hell(The Lake of Fire).. The Good News is -  The Rapture of Believers will be happening soon. Dont be left behind.. Better fish in Heaven🙏.  Romans 10:9-10 New King James Version 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
Another great video guys what about next spring trying a campaign for some big tench. Keep the videos coming they brighten the week.
What a beautiful intro! Keep up the good work guys, really appreciate all the videos.
Hey guys could you do some t shirts for merch😜😜
Great vid guys! Ever tried pellet waggling? No better way to fish for carp in my opinion. Would love to see a vid on your tutorials channel about that!
Editing is unreal!!!!!!! You guys always amaze me with the quality of your videos.
awesome video, the  footage is so relaxing. liked the jumping trout the most. keep on!
@carl and Alex why do you not weigh your fish?
Fed up with this weather, I NEED to go fishing
Damn
🎣Great catch up lads! Can’t see a ring on her finger yet.😉
liturally only watch for alex, long legged mac daddy lol
Thanks for the entertainment boys, always a fantastic job. Tight lines from Canada
Global ambassadors of the wild and exotic English countryside.
Great specimens ..in the most aaaah! Bucolic sheep flocked landscape.....
Awesome video lads that last fish was a absolute stunner 👌🏻🎣
Nice vid guys!
Please have a go for the mystery pike!
Ales's speech was awe inspiring XD Great vid as always guys. Keep em coming
Great video guys, tight lines!
Yes. The sheep are global Phenomenons!
Are you sure Alex hasn’t had some bad mushrooms recently! Global phenomenons sheep symbols! 😂
How comes you don’t disclaim the weights of the fish ?
Amazing video guys🔥🙃
4:02 lol
Shrooms got you good Alex
That looks a beautiful little pond.
Really great video, guys. But can I remind you that you should be wearing lifejackets when out on the water? Your channel is watched by many, probably young anglers and they will follow your example. Safety on the water, whatever the sport, is paramount!
Great vid, an idea for you guys....a 2021 calendar with fish you caught/pics of lakes maybe other people’s catches?
Great video. Little lakes like that thrive on neglect. Hopefully it can be left alone for a few years  now  you know what's in there .
Hello lads ! Can you recomend a lake where is grass carp ? I dont know where is a lake with this species....thanks
MERCH!!! Congrats guys 😂
Did you punch one of the twins and ask if the other felt it though..? Haha
Carl & Omi Jedi bread casting skills! Great to see how she's improved & kept at it. Another top edited upload really enjoyed it 👍👍 come on Alex it's time for a monster pike buddy 🎣 🤞
Nice, I like these mash ups of different campaigns and videos because at least for me that's also my reality of fishing... At the moment I have a campaign with an established spot at a big canal but at the same time I do a night or so in the week at various park lakes. Big Ups boys!
16:14 stay off the magic mushrooms haha.
16:30 I think alex had a bit too much to drink😂
Nice dogfish at 0:26
Love the vids lads keep it up !
Another great vid boys!
Great video but guys, life jackets please.
Now the week wait commences for a new Carl and Alex video
love the channel mate got any tips for spinner rigs like what brand bait you use
omg the big mirror at the end 😍😍😍😍😍
Stay off the mushrooms. They going to ya head with sheep 🤣
What bivvy/brolly do you guys use?
Stick to fishing. Cus you obviously don't know much about sheep and symbols. 😂😂😂
Alex: You snooze you lose. 😉
Fantastic video guys. That first Tench was an absolute beauty. ☺ Great to get a summer catch up video of you both and some of your summer adventures, although not too sure about Alex's early morning soliloquy about sheep and their historic, symbolic presence in the British countryside.😆
Brilliant video so excited for the Dropshot tutorial 😀
Fish tank update! It’s looking good
Awesome video!
Alex dude all that weed fishing gives you a relaxed mind
Alex were you picking the mushrooms out the sheep field per chance? The small ones with a nipple on the top. It would explain the utter rubbish you were talking.  Carl, lift the bloody net!! 😂🤣😂
Absolutely brilliant as usual although did wonder what Alex had taken when he was talking about the sheep 😂
Another enjoyable video lads top dangling 👌 Be safe !
I need to go fishing! I’m sad I have not been in like 2 weeks
love the new vid lads
Wish there's no lockdown would love there to be a Carl and Alex meet
Charlie’s colour has seemed to brighten up lots recently, nice to see
A bit of fishy sunshine on a wet and windy day! 👌☀️☀️
Another excellent video. Some nice fish caught as well, one of the ponds i fish produced a 4lb Tench its primarily stocked with Carp so that came as a bit of shock to the ones who fish there and the owner. Plus its got some really nice Carp in there as well. I used to fish it with my rods on bite alarms but swapped them for a feeder rod. I have caught some stunning fish since changing over.
great vid
Absolutely love this, you guys are awesome
4:01😂😂
Bravo 👍
Another high level production - well done!!
Why don't you weigh the fish?
Awesome session ..another epic video congratz guys makes me smile everytime . Looking forward to seeing your pike ones this winter
Not sure I've seen the hat carl is wearing at the start and during the video? Potential merch? :)
16:40 onward. Alex and mushrooms again I reckon.lol

Do you guys want to go fishing ?
Alex, when the soil is too compacted,  carrots tend to grow "funny".
Who was at premiere?
another quality video, great visuals as always top job lads.
I’ve had a few Tench this year (my favourite next to Rudd) and to catch Tench of that size I’d be over the moon! Good angling boys, another excellent video.
Grasscarp in my pond look soo difriend they are allot darker allot bigger and fatter and for some reasson have bigger mouth and phins. I dont know why

Coolest fish I’ve seen in a while
That's what I enjoy the most about you guy's. Alex's off tangent wonderings about sheep...Then I thought in the same breath...Yep he's found some mushrooms hence why the sheep became involved!😂  Love everything you all do. Congratulations on where you guys are currently at!👍❤
Just got into cap and tench but I use a 7 ft spinning rod anyone give me some tips I have tried everything like hair rigs weights pop ups everything need help !!
