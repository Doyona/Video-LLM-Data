Jacob fica cada dia mais gato! ❤
I love him your honor
❤
Jacob congratulações! You are a beautiful person
chocolate boy
Andn then he DID it😍
he was brilliant as the creature. It moved me in ways i couldnt explain.  He will win an Oscar for that, mark this day.
Teamojacob
Title should be: 24 Hours with The Cuttest Guy on Earth
So he was basically was preparing to play Frankenstein and didn't even know it😌
And 3 years later he made THE MOVIE: FRANKENSTEIN! You did it Jacob, what an incredible job!
He is soooo talented, I love Frankenstein role it was so strong with a pure soul now I admire alot to Jacob Elordi , amazing . Quien diria que llegaría tan lejos y ya por fin logro THE MOVIE!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
0:04 wouldn't be surprised this was all it took for Guillermo to cast him as the creature 🧟‍♂️
I want 24 Hrs With Jacob Playing With His Dog.
Kids a stud
Very calm, articulate and tender boy. And of course, and amazing actor.
Frankenstein movie brought me here ❤
Now we will never know what Andrew Garfield s take on the Frankenstein creature, but I think Jacob did an okay job.
Fine, Frankenstein crushed my soul. I'm here, searching everything about you, Jacob.
he was most excellent in Frankenstein....
🖤
If they ever remake Twilight - he is our Edward Collin
Mi piace
The narrow road into the deep north was a masterpiece and he created such a round character playing Doriggo
Euphoria's Nate
non mi piace questo video👎🫰
The dark knight best movie of all time
Hopefully friendship professional Family Ally nothing romantically involved or anything like that
This is what it looks like when someone actually thinks about what shaped them instead of parroting curated cool aesthetics.
this. is. my. husband.
Jacob Elordi for James Bond !!!
When did people start using the word "like" as a filler word?? It has become hurtful to the ears: "It was like...", "and I was so like..." UGGHHHH
As expected , the comments  are full of women
Jacob is so fine ❤
watching the way this kid acts, you can tell he is special. watching and listening to him here, you know he is special. great kid.
They hate him because of his character. But I think he his a nice guy.❤❤❤
Hopefully a friendship a confidant an ally of platonic etcetera Mentor nothing more than that
I suddenly have a huge crush on him and I don’t know why
if i don't do this now, Jacob, i might get physically hurt. i've been deliberately ignoring Marjorie regarding you, but now she needs me to tell you that she is ecstatic about you. Marjorie Moehlenkamp used that word: ecstatic 😄💗💗
I don’t even listen to what he’s saying I just love to stare at his face
His choices of clothes s so cool
I like how he gave a tour of the outside❤❤❤
He would make a terrific detective 👌🏻 fincher needs to go the mank route, but make it a noir with elordi in the lead, on swift horses seems kind of noirish.
Our Aussie boy.💕💕💕
I can't wait to see his movie role. He did say that he would love to play Batman. In the words of Elle Evans, "He's stupid hot."😊
is that maxwell playing in the background??
Wishing you the best in your quest for that one role.  You are more handsome than James Dean, and you should be on the big screen for sure.
I'm in love
24hrs....only spends 2pm to 6pm LOL! Nice inside look tho, but very inaccurate title.
74 inches door really.
4:59 Film Noir section
Бред Питт в молодости
❤
Mi novio alaberga
He seems like the most boring dude! 😴😴😴💤💤
Cool to see a pop culture star who genuinely loves classic movies.
he's way more mature than i thought he would be😭
He’s so deep and organically charismatic. You can tell that he’s generally compelled by the art of acting, and that just makes him even more real and more attractive. The “sexiness“ is gone and it’s replaced by being so much more attractive overall listening to him talk. I think he’s gonna have a lot of really great things ahead of him.
While he is attractive, I feel like he's a try hard
He has a really nice vibe to him ✨
this feels like we are talking to eachother after he railed me so hard last night
Such a pure, sweet, strong Spirit.
mmmm
I’m disappointed that this video is only 9 minutes long… I wanted to see the full 24 hours.
how many times have you watched this ? me: yes!
взаимно
Я из другой страны не трогай мое имя сука
Мистер кадави вы не устали качать мою жизнь
Inspiring
All of you girls noticing the title change… i see you are revisiting the video….. i see one time hasn’t been enough….
Purrr vogue changed the title to saltburn just like the did this with the squid game actress
he is cute tho
One of my favourite videos ever
I also own a ricohflex  camera
Need him inside me
he’s so fine. why it looks like he’s always flirting
he’s so mine
can i please be your dog too? i mean i have the personality of a golden retriever lol
NEED the jacket
Как же он похож на Юрия Шатунова. Юра бессмертен! ❤❤❤
We hate Nate but love Jacob! ❤️
Fantastic actor! I just love him! So mega talented, brilliant, dynamite personality and of course- gorgeous! ❤️🙂🤗😎👍
Eu casaria com ele.
I was going to ask how they released a video in promo for a movie almost 2 years later, until I read the comments about the title change 😂
The Australian American accent is crazy
Changing the video title by adding their latest movie name, smart Vogue :)
so handsome
jacob elordi plz marry me
OY BARTUKICIM COK TATLI AMK
15? 😊
DELULU IS THE SOULULU
It’s funny how an actor might not equate a move that previews via a streaming service as a movie 😅
I don't remember seeing Saltburn 2 years ago
I’m secretly that dog
Was saltburn out two years ago? 😮
so dumb to change the title to saltburn when he talks so much about euphoria in this hello
24 ≠ 4
I could literally fall in love with this guy >.<
He is delectable, something about this guy and his look
I really hate it when you see an Aussie move to the US and they soon start having an American accent. He needs to be around fellow Aussies so.he doesn't lose it. Hugh Jackman, Cate Blanchett, Margo Robbie have been able to keep there accents.
Fantastic actor, really gets into the characters he plays. He is absolutely beautiful ❤
why did he run like that 💀
that coffee mug  he keeps sipping out of is totally empty
The dog  made me click 😍❤
Isn't he a great person very down to earth guy no pretention of whatever I just like him a very neat guy ❤
jacob will look superb as super hero in marvel movies
Clearly LA has gotten to him. Pretentious
Surprised he didn’t grab your throat.
I hope the film crew wore neck braces for safety whilst filming this?
Hearing his aussie acccent is so strange.
What Harry Jowsey wishes he was
As a native Bostonian I keep mistaking his Australian accent for a Boston one.
lmao how they change the title to skyrocket the views after saltburn
24 hours? This isn’t even 10 minutes? Nice try
so they changed the title😂
THIS VIDEO IS SOOOOOOO SATISYING TO WATCH
Am I the only one that is like, this was maybe like 2 hrs not 24
I'm fine with 30min
Didn’t anyone have the courage to tell them there’s a “c” in picture?
7:40 I love the way he’s just casually eating his ice cream w his hand on his hip 💀
Loved Saltburn……..he was wonderful,they all were……….Donna in Toronto
I want him!
he has a lot more personality than many of the characters he ends up playing
Does anyone know what's the brand of the jacket he wears at the end?
Yall really changed the title lmao
More like less than 12 hours...
Gosh I love that film noir moment!
this was pretty cool actually. he is more handsome than talented but he will learn a lot and become one of the best because he is  very passionate about it
idk its giving bojack horseman
he is so hot and brillian actor!
Bro kinda fast in that last clip
He's like a Matthew McConaughey for younger generation
I found him Boring
he's a cute
I love him 🥹
I love that the title of this video was edited a year later, when saltburn was released
he looks and sounds like Mila Kunis husband, cannot remember his name :))
Crazy how they’ve now edited this to say « Saltburn’s Jacob Elordi » after a year
Bro casually has his Hasselblad and Rolleiflex out
I thought I loved him after petting his dog like that but then he stopped to take pictures of Flowers. Who is this guy? ❤❤❤❤
I've completely lost focus, what was he saying?
What a humble, aware and kind fellow. Refreshing to see these young bright souls without too much ego and wise beyond their years
he needs to play flynn rider
anyone know anything about the buffalo 66 painting?
All of that and a Golden Retriever…perfect!
OMG
Clout is a hella of a drug vogue. I see u changed it to salt burn.
9:15 "I haven't really made a movie yet" well you made Saltburn and Priscilla, does that count??
I'm so in love with him. Oml
need him in a war movie
Dear Felix why didnt you give Oliver a wet french kiss  😢😅
I think I'm in love.
why they rename the video!!!????😭😭😭 JUST MAKE NEW 24 HRS W/ JACOB!!!!!!!
First “24 Hours with” episode focused on the interview and who the actor really is behind the scenes. Everything was so creative and easy to listen to. Best wishes to this lad and I know he’s going to go even further in his career.
I would love to get paid to spend 24 hrs with Jacob Elordi
I can’t believe he’s Australian - his super rp English accent in saltburn was perfect!
He is so handsome 🥰
He is so simple, very successful yet so down to earth, he looks like a great guy and excellent actor too. Im glad to see him, the "real" Jacob in this video. Appreciated.
The title ?? Changed or I’m crazy
yes guys, i am “she” ik ik ☺️☺️
Oh, he's a nerd. I love him
Muito lindo. O lugar também
Jacob is one of the Euphoria actors who will not be forgotten
AAAAAAAAAAAAA YEEEEIIII
the way they changed the title💀💀💀
3:48 hes got me giggling and shiii
how come the title says saltburn even though it only came out a month ago and this vid was like 2022?? i need answers!!
LOVE THE SUBTLE TITLE CHANGE !!!😭😭
Not the title change😭
And now he’s on the 2 most talked about movies! Saltburn and Pricilla! Well done to him ❤
Hahaha love the little noir! Such a fun video
Why does his house look like Bojack Horseman’s property and the dog is Mr PeanutButter?
Phenomenol in Saltburn❤
does anyone know what jacket he is wearing at the end? the leather bomber jacket?
the way it used to be euphoria jacob now it’s saltburn they changed the title 😭
Basque beauty
Instant fan. What a sweetheart vibe... especially as he cuddles his dog :)
Coffs Harbour mention
i think he is an exceptional actor ... Saltburn was a fire ,.. he was amazing in it ...
Talented actor!
i just fell in love
I watched all 9 minutes 47 seconds wagging my legs and blushing
Did they just changed its title? Because salt burn wad released a month ago ig
Not them changing the title after Saltburn came out LOL
I'm so mad his personality is just as hot as he looks 😂
I find it funny how they changed the video's title to "saltburn's Jacob elordi"
papi chulo
his style, the way he talks, his passion. where do i find one of him 😍
At the end he’s so adorable saying I’m gonna see a movie now 😊
I feel like hes showing us his house, a place where he actually lives. A bit of mess here and there, a coffee machine he actually uses etc. Its really endearing!
He comes across as a down to earth , genuinely authentic guy. He's lovely.
To hear someone SO attractive and obviously so talented say they were repeatedly rejected is weirdly comforting and relatable and also speaks to how wildly competitive acting is. He’s definitely on the cusp, though.
He’s my roman empire
The sea level is rising at an increasing level I feel like
then along come saltburn
he is adorable. I want him for my son-in-law.
I…is he British I keep hearing a British accent but then it goes away
watching this a year later.. you got your movie bro !!! Saltburn was wild
He has a golden retriever personality 😍
who’s here after Saltburn
if they showed the whole 24hrs i would defo watch it all i can look at him for daya
Fell in love with him in Saltburn ❤
i would have melted if i was the cashier giving him ice cream lol
I did that too when living in a new city. Just go to cinema by myself for a reward, enjoying, chatting to random people sometimes, observing how people react if possible etc. Fun activities 😂
here after watching saltburn. I think I'm a fan 😂
I find it cool that a lot of the Hollywood stars live in small houses.
crazy how he is elvis now
He sounds so in vain. Like...grow up.
jacob is so daddy yas
He should play Jay Leno
You know that Brittany Broski is here somewhere yelling at this video.
need him
Why you ppl date puppies... Like mr. Sean opry
I'm here after watching him in Saltburn, saw it at the theatre. Guess he did go to the movies after all!
He is so INFP coded haha
Now he has saltburn pricilla and many more coming. He seems like a great guy
1 year later - he's had 2 major pictures!!!!!!!
Классный канал, от подачи не устаёшь
hahaha making decent coffee - so Australian. In love
👍
He has the face and charisma for a film noir
0:54 yeeeees i love that seeing James deans face everywhere was his first memory of Hollywood.
These aussies got the yankee accent down. I had no idea he wasn't american.
9:09- He's done so much in just a year!! Saltburn and Pricilla seem like the first of many of him being in "movie" movies, that's amazing for him!!
He's just sooooo cute!!! lol
And then he made great movies!
I want him so bad
Well, now you have Saltburn under your belt buddy! Great job on that! Loved that film!
I’m in love
9:00 him saying hes never made a real movie and made stuff for streaming services, but i just watched Priscilla and he did amazing! im so happy that he got to do that with a24
He gives me 1940-50's men vibe, vintage becomes on him I think he has that vintage look on him.
I e only seen this actor in Priscilla and he did a great job. That 🐶 though 💙🤗
Hope he never loses his Aussie accent.
He seems .. very tall to Play ...Elvis ...😊 just my opinion...
He sounds and looks like a young Christian Bale
boyfriend reveal!!
Not that I want it, BUT if they ever remake “Rebel Without a Cause”…
He’s so boyfriend
a star in the making...
Does anyone know what that leather jacket is by chance? Please!!! :)
Film noir with them pls
he does things to me
Jacob and Hollywood sign? I remember Kissing Booth ☺️
Opening moments are still so sad. RIP fez 😔
And he's Basque!   Basque!!!
🌀
Awesome dude! Hope we see him more often in shows & movies. 🙌🏻
He’s cute
He has such a calming energy
Rest in peace Angus Cloud
Whoever told Jacob Elordi that he’s a “terrible actor” is delusional..
🥰
Hes a giant baby ❤❤❤ very gorgeous very genuine
os posters de filmes aaa muito eu
espero no futuro, ter uma casa tão aconchegante quanto
I need him biblically
in conclusion: you know ☺
You can tell he is losing his hair by the comb forward
He looks like Steven R mcqueen
Nate after therapy:
This is 9 mins.
During his pickleball match with Olivia Jade, Jacob observed her serving and stated, *_"I hit that."_*
They should have him cameo on the Superman and Lois show, as Bruce Wayne.
omg this house looks super expensive haha
He is my crush😘
During a game of pickleball, Jordan Elordi watched Olivia Jade serving. He exclaimed *_"I hit that."_*
His voice is so calming and the vibe is so peaceful. This video is my fav of all time
I banged him at Coachella '21. Solid lay 8/10
What dog does he have?
Anybody knows what that watch is?
The film noir bit was golden
the video should have 24h... just saying.
I love him since Kissing Booth .. hoping new Kissing Booth Coming
Fascinating that both he and Chalamet both wanted to become actors after seeing The Dark Knight, especially given the fact that they are two of the best male actors of their generation. Also, cute dog.
With his attire, he reminds me of my grandpa😂 he used to let me sit in his lap.😅❤
Him talking is so therapeutic
Literally me
I respect you! Save soil #tahoe
Cute as phoque.
I see Alain Delon and a little bit of of Tom Cruise in him
whatever nate, we aint gonna trust anythin' you say pal,we know your dark side,
What if this wasn't his real voice and his real voice was like Stitch lol
SUPERMAN
How can someone be so beautiful yet scary
De qué país es el hombre? Aquí en Argentina hay mucha gente con Apellido Elordi
Absolutely despised his character so bravo!
The dog is so beautiful. Love ❤
he hooks up with men in that theatre
love that they made his dream a reality even for a tiny bit of time
He’s a James Dean fan……..it all makes sense. All love
handsome hansome handsome
James Dean was one of my idols, having grown up in the 1950s here in Yankeeland.
It’s so weird hearing his real voice after watching him in euphoria and kissing booth😂 But it’s kinda hot Ngl
Co cute ❤❤
I had no idea he is Australian what
I am in love. 😍
i love him sm😩😩😩
A star is born
Nate Jacobs rules
진짜 존나 잘생겼다…
I love him! He's so calm, and relaxing.
no empaty for abusers many abuser's victim are not evil
nate jacobs elordi
Jacob คือหล่อ สูง หุ่นดี อ่อนโยน รักสัตว์😳❤
If the movie The Notebook is ever to be remade, I think it would be appropriate for him to act as the male lead character
i just got pregnant listening to his voice
He is a flower person?
he's so majestic
He is the epitome of not actually hot -- just tall
love him
what brand is his bomber jacket?
euphoriaur
He’s literally perfect
Mera next philam ka bruce wayne
I didn’t know he wasn’t american💀
Even in Euphoria he’s so freaking angelic. And I want to touch his hair so much.
He is so big 🥵
I don't watch TV, so I kept wondering why the word *euphoria* was being used so much.  Had to read some comments to figure out its context in this life-changing mind-altering interview...  😋
He's really handsome❤
why he’s has a so relaxing voice ? 🥺✨
The guy is like 9 feet
i forgot he was australian
I Love  Jacob Eliord
❤🎶
I’m jealous of any body who gets to meet him ❤
He is one of those guys that you just can't stop smiling looking at
i cant relate to anyone in Euphoria
Great clip!
HELP: where can i find a bomber jacket like the one he is wearing in this video?
he is sooo handsome it's unreal
i love this guy
Hopefully the Next Superman!!!🦸‍♂️ He's 6'5", got the looks & acting chops! Sups in the Conics is 6'3", have to be tall, this dude fits perfectly!
Yes…. He is SUPERMAN!!!
Não vos deixeis levar em redor por doutrinas várias e estranhas, porque bom é que o coração se fortifique com graça, e não com alimentos que de nada aproveitaram aos que a eles se entregaram.  Hebreus 13:9
Jacob Is SUPERMAN
loooooooooooooooooove him like wow (if only casting couches could talk)
Him as DCU Superman pls
SUPERMAN
Bartum
He definitely doesn't look 25,something older
Gosh he is such a sweetheart and so poetic hahaha. I love him, he is such a darling.
I loved when he talked about everyone's traumas and the background behind them, also about james Dean! he has a lot of knowledge and he talks with passion, that is so admirable! I would love to have a conversation with him :)
Can we have Evan peters pls.?
I’ve walked past his house not knowing it was his till seeing this
He takes a picture of flowers while he eats ice cream❤😍 he is the sweetest 😍
i was so used to him being nate that i forgot that he had an accent 😂
I love how he injoys the tiny things
I love seeing who he is actually
Soooo... where can I see the full 24 hours?
ughh another pisces moon😍♓️so ethereal and gentle by nature. And he’s fine af!
Jacob and his doggie are so cute 🥺
i know he didnt get paid for the acting in this video🤚
Wanne have him as a friend ❤
Is Jacob Elordi married?
Can you find Jacob Elordi! I must talk to him?
He goes to the movies by himself?!?
I'm glad he knows who James Dean is. Unlike Tom Holland who barely knows the great Al Pacino.
Wowowwww, my favorite Noah in Kissing Booth!! Love you, my dear Handsome, cute, charming, adorable and talented actor..
Jacob elordi is unreal, like…. How could human look this beautiful
I can see this guy playing Superman.
Malditos anuncion me tienen arto!! No dejas ver bien el contenido
How can anyone be so PERFECT.
HE HAS AN ACCENT???
Omggg i love this man
👩‍🚀
I’m so similar to him lmao. He’s such a great human and a great actor. 🖤
I love him 😍 and his big hands.
He's going to play Elvis Presley in Sofia Coppola's new film "Elvis and Me". He's handsome, lets see if he captures The King's charm.
jacob is so artistic!
What a great guy.
Bartu askm nabıon
Ciao Jacobs sei simpatico e bellissimo ti auguro tanta fortuna per la tua carriera bay
The way he crossed the road
He shouldn’t talk about where he hangs out. I just don’t want him to be mobbed.
My god i love him so much
Jacob what the nice dog
whats the name of this sunglasses?
Protect this mans at all cost
😎🖤
Very nice video ;) Does anyone know the brand of his trousers?
This man is a chad.
Jews promoting Jews! It's below mediocrity! Pathetic!
I did not expect him to be Australian 💀
His journey is almost parallel to mine. 2,500+ auditions, too old, too young, too fat, too thin, wrong hair/skin/eyes etc. He described my life. What a wonderful young man. The struggle is real. An actor’s life is definitely not easy, but the rewards are monumental.
Phenomenal 💜❤️
I love this show so much! I finally finished it a few weeks ago.
I was quite shocked when I found out he was only 21 in Kissing booth.
<3
Wow he is very handsome.
He's beautiful, he's beautiful, he's handsome very handsome I fell in love with him as soon as I saw him.
Am I the one who's happy to learn that Jacob is a fan of James Dean?
He is such a beautiful soul.  What a wonderful interview. I could listen to him talk about art, movies, anything really for hours.
It’s so weird seeing him so vulnerable and genuine. He is a phenomenal actress
amazing house💓
❤
🥺the beautiful boy of girls
A such wattpad guy vibe
he is not staring in a big movie yet ?
He gives me butterflies fr !
What a pleasant and eloquent human being! Wow
i always forget he has an accent bruh
i am in love with this man
his chin reminds me of squidward
He’s the finest actor out there! ❤️🔥
If I were living in LA I would go to this movie theatre every day waiting for him to show up and for my shot with Jacob 😂😂   Jk I love my bf 💘
The Kissing Booth  🥺❤
Cool man
I can't get enough,maybe 1 month
BEBEĞİM BARTUKIÇIM
He is so boring and basic and I NEED HIM TO WRECK MY HOLE NOWWWW
An actor like him he’s going to be in a movie and he’s going to carry the whole film and hopefully that character will become another awesome iconic character for that guy
He's actually an amazing actor. The way he's so kind means a lot and also I love the way he looks in every single outfit
his inner energy is so strong that you can't help feeling it
I love his leather jacket!
He's perfect for James Bond - not only for his looks, physique and acting skill - but also for his deep voice (which I find lacking in Henry Cavill), and he's young enough to be trained for the role and to last several sequels. Importantly, he's going to be fairly more affordable than the veteran A-list stars and this will allow the producers to invest more in production values.
4:34  Laughs in Seven Samurai.
💗
I didn’t know he was Australian-
Is Jacob British?
YA.....EVEN THE AFRICAN BORN TO EXPERIENCE THEIR DRY HOT TO DEATH LIFE.   CANNOT COMPARE TO YOURS
what he said about trauma was spot on
What a sweat-hearted man. Love this guy.
Lindo 😌
It's my baby Jacob birthday happy birthday my love ❤️❤️
he’s likable, talented and a little geeky, god i love him
Does he live in L.A or in Brisbane??
It says 24 hours why the f did it finish after 9 minutes and 47 seconds. Unsubscribe. Why is YouTube nothing but stinkin clickbait these days, frick vogue and jamie. Your name is for girls. .
Jacob would’ve been great as a younger Homelander.
his accent is very strong enough
The fact that he has watched Buffalo 66 😍😍😍😍😍
the way he crosses the street JAJAJAJA so cute
The fact I was thinking of Buffalo 66 in the beginning of this video.
2:04 3:05 5:04 7:01 6:18 A Film Noir Fever Dream
Anyone know what bomber jacket that is
Who’s this pretty boy and why he keep coming to my feed over and over again?!
🇧🇷❤️
Same IKEA lamp - *feels like a CELEBRITY*
His parents and elders did a good job! He's quite charming.
PERFECT! You can see how much it has evolved; )) cute / Você pode ver o quanto ele evoluiu; )) bonitinho
I absolutely love that he stopped and took photos of the flowers
His the kind of guy that talks and talks and talks but even if you don't really know what it was he's talking about, it's mesmerizing just listening to him. 🥺🥰🥰🥰
💛💚💙💜🤎🖤❤🧡💛
He is genuinely such a nice person and his acting is phenomenal.
He is kind of cute and seems nice enough... the film noir was pretty cool, should have been longer :-)
Thank GOD....he's human. Not always as good looking as he is in Euphoria!
isn't he the most charming man alive right now
24h in 9minutes
24 hours with Jacob  Video : 9 minutes
i think we're soul mates, maybe we'll be together in another life lol
3:45 good soup
He would be a good choice if they ever did some sort of movie related to American Psycho - like a younger Patrick Bateman? I think he would do well in that based on his looks and character played on Euphoria
the way he dashes to the theater at the end 😭😂
Hopefully he will play Ryle 🤍 in it ends with us
Such a lovely humble man. I could listen to him talk all day.... and with his dog ❤️
He plays nate so well, he's such an incredible actor, bc he seems like such a genuine human in person.
He’s British
Jacob, i love you <3 <3 <3 So cute <3 Come in France please !
he's nothing like nate
For those judging him you should watch the kissing booth!!! Then form your opinion
hottest it boy this year ❤
D’awwww
I didn’t knew he has a accent 😂😂😂😂😂
24 hours with Jacob Elordi and now I have diabetes
lol good soup
"she's a natural actress she dosent preform in the camera"-Jscob Elordi
Pétition pour faire venir Lily-Rose Depp svp !
Funny how he mentioned the dark knight movie because I think he'd be a good batman :)
Wtf he's Australian! 😱💚
He's so preety 😍
i think i´m in love.
he’s losing his accent a little
the accent ❤❤❤❤
nothing against him but when I found out he is not American he immediately stopped being that attractive to me, I know many people would probably disagree but I just prefer Americans lol
man I'm just wishing i was the lady at the ice cream store lmao
oml he’s such a good actor.. i kinda hate him only bc of his character EVEN THO HES JUST AN AMAZING ACTOR
Hollywood give him a moooovviiee already!
Jacob is a very cool guy, talented, creative and thoughtful as well as being extremely handsome.  It’s such a pity he’s losing his Aussie accent though. I guess continually playing American characters on TV and in movies plus being surrounded by Americans all the time is why he sounds so American now.  I much prefer his Aussie accent, he needs to see his Aussies friends more often in order not to lose it further.
That’s not 24 hrs it’s 9:45 minutes
SO HANDSOME ❤️
Don't know who this guy is but I clicked because his house looks very home-y and now I think I'm a fan 😂 You can tell how much he is influenced by James Dean. Been a while since I last saw anyone with that much JD aesthetic about him.
I didn’t know he was British!?
how are people confusing and aussie accent with british? 😭
HE HAS AN ACCENT??!????
He has such a beautiful soul. Love it.
Buffalo 66! Representing the 716!!!
WHY DOES HE PLAY THE MOST EVIL CHARACTERS BUT IS THE SWEETEST PERSON
guys who stop to take pics of the flowers need to be protected at all costs ❤️
Who knows the brand of his green jacket?
He’s so beautiful and here I am, it’s really not fair.
MY CRUSH 💕
Eklig der typ
Baby jacob😻😻
the things i would do to have 24 hours with this men…….
i clicked on the video after watching euphoria and i forgot he has an accent when i tell u i was shocked
omg i cannot stand him hes literally the definition of a hipster hes the corniest guy ive ever seen
Am I the only one that hasn’t seen the show yet..?
На самый просто так не попадают
Why nobody noticed that he is so handsome
1:30 when he forgot he was british😅
Looks like he lives in los feliz. As an aussie that has visited LA a number of times, it's one of my fave neighbourhoods and where I'd live also <3
He is the most humble hot boiiii I ever saw lol
I love how he empathizes with Nate, I always do the same with that character. 🤍
I just love his personality out of the show smm like how can sm1 be this sweet and nice 😭💕
and this is why I love Jacob Elordi. so down-to-earth.
Bartu lan
He looks like the good version of Bryce Hall if that makes sense..or am I just drunk in sleepiness.
Lol boring
Don’t care about him but I clicked for his dog.
Please, can any humble soul tell me what kind of trousers is he using? I simply can't figure it out. His style fits so well
I love how simple he is
He looks lonely. I can fix that.
He is still so pure in heart just living his dreams, hopefuly Hollywood will not consume his good heart and principles. But he is also inteligent with strong will, so he can go far without changing much. Can’t wait for more Jacob on screen and one day a full great movie, indeed. Euphoria is great format also, can’t wait for another series🤗💯💙
He can be the next Superman
What kind of watch is he wearing?
His voice is so good to listen
IM OBSESSed
“the lost feel-iz theater” theater instead of “lost fel-eez” lolll
Sensitive & poetic. Hollywood, please don’t eat him alive.....
Pisces moon energy I love it
Never heard of this guy, but so far, so good🤷🏼‍♀️
the running across the street 😩😭🥲 why is he like this
literally feel like i’m spending the day with my boyfriend. this also reminds me how single i am.
Nate Jacobs: 👿☠️😡🤬😠🙄😒 Jacob elordi:  😊🥳✨💙😅🧚🏻‍♂️🌸
HOW CAN SUCH A GREAT, AMAZING MAN PLAY THE MOST RUDE, HATED CHARACTER IN THE SHOW
The snobbish otter collectively squash because money intriguinly unpack minus a scientific cost. deadpan, aboard poison
Id of the watch and the ring?
daddy
Really love his style
ni se ingles pero que guapo
Hes so precious.
He’s actually nice in real life haha . Interesting.
He is such a very sensitive and bohemian style man ! And he is not faking it to look like he is different, he looks authentic. I hope he’d have the opportunity to express himself through more interesting characters than a mean and wild Nate
he gotta half Aussie accent and American now :(
i will always love this man >>
this guy is really truly amazing he’s really laid back
gosh he’s fine
Woowww.... Just Wowww.
Film noir and new noir are some of my favorite film genres.
one of mot hot guys I ve ever seen
Wow, who thought nate would be this deep and interesting to listen to  Such an amazing interview 💙
Those little hoop earrings and the rings are so cool, he is gorgeous AND talented. Hope Euphoria launches his career.
*"24 hours with Jacob Elordi" .... 4 hours later.... "Thank you so much for spending the day with me.."*
His acting in Euphoria is just mind-blowing
OMG he's here
He is so fine😍😍😍
HE DID THE GOOD SOUP
I knew I liked him, he has a Golden Retriever lol
so weird he doesn't give skevs vibes but he does at the same time
Sigh…cancer men 😍
I love how he runs towards the theatre at the end
cutie
And he's also increadbly smart and kind...........? I mean
💕❤️🙊🥵
he’s a pure soul :,)
he deserves better casting; so much untapped potential acting wise
Always wanted to see him and Nicholas hoult in a film together
The fact I hate bro character shows me he’s that fire of a actor lol
3:47 he did not just say good soup lmfaoo the memes live on lets goo
Dudes tryna sound smart when he’s clearly not
Support Ukraine 🇺🇦
i wanna eat ice cream and take pics of flowers with jacob elordi
the fact that he said "im off to the pictures" - ahh he is a vintage dream
73 ques. with JENNIE JIMM
I never liked this guy. I didn’t liked him at all bc I had this preconceived idea of him based on the roles he has played and the films/shows he’s been in. I really empathized w him when he said that he would like to make A REAL movie, watching him in a more sincere image and hearing his ambitions has changed completely my idea of him. I guess he is just a guy who loves cinema, and I do respect that. I respect him.
And here is the next Batman
Those sunglasses anyone????? Where do it get them
He is like a mixture of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. He is cute and nice
🌚
hes so fineee
He seems so easy going and absolutely true to himself.
he has such an old soul, but in a good wayyyyyy 😍
This is what I'm talking about sweet man who likes to walk to go get ice cream 🍦 stops to take a 📸 of flowers 💐 🌸🌼🌸🌼 loves to talk and watch old cinema 🎥....And he is so down to earth 🌎.....I love this qualities in a guy😉👌🏽✨️ 10 out of 10
I love him as a person 3:26 💕 but I strongly dislike Nate 🙃
this might sound crazy but he could probably pull off a young clark kent
JE DETESTE LES GENS PIEDS NUS
Good soup!
Why so handsome?
6:04 I hear Jacob and Nate 😂
Watching this after watching Jacob on Hot Ones. Someone said he is a “gentle giant” and I completely agree after that interview.
I actually like who he is outside of Nate. Who would’ve thought. 🙃
the girl at the ice cream shop probably scremaing inside
Me after watching season 2: i hate you…but i love you… but i hate you
Yes I know he’s Nate Jacobs…but he was Noah Flynn first
Sounds like he’s losing his Aussie Accent
Can't wait for the moment when Jacob lands a starring role in a new, original big screen film noir... !! YES PLEASE! Do you hear that Hollywood? Here's your chance to make something special! Here's ya boy.... now, who would play the leading lady along side Jacob?
he's literally the exact opposite of nate
Lolll.. my impression of the comment board on this video  Jacob: *"and this is my backyard"*    All the young fast as* teenagers and/or 20 somethings in the comments  : *"OMG you see how he arch his eyebrow when he said the word (insert any word here) ...WHAT AN INCREDIBLY WONDERFUL AND CHARITABLE... sensitive person*  *The fact he isnt who he is gets paid highly to BE ON TELEVISION means hes the next Marlon Brando .. I mean the fact he doesnt talk with same accent that he does on the show really means he will probably win an oscar for his role*   *also Because he owns a dog...Hes probably a great  PHILANTHROPIST and CHESS PLAYER.  And probably is a classically trained trombone player*  *I'm trying not to act like a thirsty fan so instead of saying I want to blow him I'm going to write a 5000 word comment on what a great person I perceive him to be based off of a 10 minute video ... cus I'm actually tryna disguise the fact I'd let him impregnate me"*  🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️  Yall all need some WATER. 🚿🚿⛲🍶  Quoting something
I’ve run into him a couple of times at a dog park in Hollywood, and not only is he extremely attractive, but also very nice and down to earth. His dog is extremely adorable too.
He's like this generation's Heath Ledger.
Truly a great actor, I’m in awe of him
I'm so scared of him because of euphoria HAHAHAHA
24 hours and we only get 9 minutes and 46 seconds?
He’s got an accent?? 🤯
He could be a good bruce wayne just sayin. He's got that quite unsocial personality
I Swear ppl are blind when it comes to talent…Somebody help make this man’s dreams come true💥💳
Very opposite to his character Nate, Jacob exudes that warmth and genuine vibes. I would surely want to be his friend
Truly enjoyed this video
ele é tão lindo

https://youtu.be/X77lescagKc......
He's so attractive, it almost hurts watching him...
I will watch anything he takes a part in. Love him! He is a great actor.
He sounds Australian and American
His room was great 😍
.
No gym no workout??
HE HAS AN ACCENT 😩😩😩?
I’d like to see him in a role where he doesn’t use any other accent
He’s so wholesome. I love him
Oh Jacob 🥺  you can tell how much he loves his profession and how passionate he is about it, all the knowledge he has about cinema and acting shows it all. We barely have actors/actresses these days with such vast knowledge of the field they're working in.
He definitely deserved to be nominated for an Emmy alongside Zendaya. Hopefully this time
He is so evil in euphoria he makes me so mad how can someone be able to act that good he must have a bit of psychopath inside him in real life
Jacob seems sooo calm and peacfull we have to appreciate him more
That is exactly how carefully I cross a road🤌
He’s beautiful
Such a talented actor !!!!!!!
good god he is very handsome!
He takes random pictures of flowers. He’s like me for real 🙂
3:48 just became my favorite thing on the internet
because I’m Japanese, I’m glad to see that he has an old Japanese poster. He is amazing!!

he’s so sweet <3333
awww he’s so cute❤️❤️
Jacob Elordi is the definition of someone born in the wrong generation
I know this is too soon but I could see him playing Batman
Another useless entitled beta, do you have any male in you?
Hold on .... Is he British !?
i’m in love with this man, his rings and how nice and genuine he seems omg. he’s so talented as well.
Hope he doesn't sell his soul.
Thank you for sharing bro .
😍
How he touches his dog🥺🥺
I'm in love with him now
Kissing booth!
The way he says euphoria as “euphorior” 😻
I love all of the drawings he have, cool pieces
That run at the end, he’s so adorable 🥰
i've never known true desire until i saw this FINE mans
HE IS BRITISH?????
My gawd I love this man
What a handsome man, wao!😍😋
I've been seeing a lot of inside videos with Sydney Sweeney too (also a very unlikeable character aha) so it's nice to see how nice of a person they in real life.
He should play Superman.
hes the complete opposite of Nate which funny asf to me lmao
wow that guy looks so identical to nate jacobs. crazy lad
I didn’t know he had an accent
Jacob Elordi x Robert Pattinson I shipp them so hard 😍😍🥰
The way he ran across the street at the very end is the best part of this video 🥲🥲
Mi útero jamás había estado tan alterado por un vídeo, qué hermosa persona se siente al hablar jaja
he's so cute .
he's so cute
Ok but him having an accent just makes way more sense
I feel like he’s loosing his accent 😥
Cemal Cana benziyor aga
Hear me out: Jacob Elordi as James Bond.
he's boring
He scared me as nate
the new heart throb 😍😍😍
my dream man
He is natural and passionate.  it shines out  and he talks about Heath  it's awesome!  i fell in love with him. I will always support you. Take care of yourself Jacob ♥️
omg he's an aussie??
Ofc he’s British 😂💯
Didn’t know he had an accent
bu ask değil de ne be
Good luck for you being one of the most hated faces for the folks today lol :D
i wish it was real
he really is a true artist wow.
This man’s personality is GORGEOUS
Gorgeous man
I love you Jacob but this was so boring lol
i love jacobbbb
Honestly was  watching to judge him and oh how wrong I was. Assuming he was snobby and full of himself and love when I’m wrong, he’s so well put together, kind, humble and I just really really like him. Seems like the type of person to open the door for you and say good morning.
Like this guy hits my soul very deep with his 90s 80s classic vibe! Triggers me! F$%k!!!
He's lovely
His house kinda lookslike Blackpink Jennie's house in LA...
The way he's holding the ice cream 😂❤️
HOW DARE NATE COME TO HOLLOYWOOD
Bruh this dude mad cute.
Love him!
Vogue is now an official censor? Vogue is now against freedom of speech? Vogue’s editorial decision to censor and limit freedom of speech is  anti-democratic, and so like Putin. Vogue represents many shady people and practices yet inexplicably obliterates the name of an oppressed people - the Palestinians. This matter is seriously concerning. I will forever out Vogue.
You can tell Jacob Elordi is a talented actor because his real life personality is the opposite of Nate Jacobs. He is the definition of a gentle giant.
film noir lover? my man.
vogue sure knows how to catch some youtube views lol they only make content with very popular people
A man who’s lived in a small apartment across the Hollywood now lives under the sign. Life’s unpredictable but always bright for hardworking and ambitious dreamers.
He was like... "kind of" blabla "sort of" blabla "you know like" ...
What is this interiour design called? I've looked everywhere for a long time now and can't figure it out.
😍😍😍😍😍
Yawn more white privileged males.
the fact that if Daya sees this, she'd be like "BEEN THERE, DONE THAT, LITERALLY" Kills  me XD
damnit. I like him now.
good soup
I want 24hrs with kissing booth Jacob not creepy euphoria jacob
he is so smart i could listen for hours
His sunglasses are so cool.. does anyone know where he got them?
Jacob Elordi is actually Nate Jacobs in parallel universe.
i wanted to hate him so bad :,(
he looks like a very beautiful and awesome person, I like him
He's so sweet
I adore him. I don’t know why. Great actor, I believe.
i actually hate him bc nate

He has such an old soul
this video is so calm it’s amazing

Does anybody know the name of those glasses???? Guys plssssss
He has such a sweet & cute personality so much better then Nate lol
Now we want Hunter Schafer's hours 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Not me expecting him to have an America accent 😅😅
"I'm off to the pictures.." who says that? The one and only, Jacob Elordi.
He's so lovely, remarkably forthcoming
When he was just standing there eating his ice cream 🥺
I don’t find him particularly attractive when I see him on films…but he’s very charismatic and uhmm he is so cute in this interview talking about films!!
He is soo handsome ❤️
I didn't s33 him n3rklng 0ff tho???!!
кайф кайф кайф от души кайфовать хочу кайфовать
He's so handsome
Jacob Elordi in suit...nice
He loves film noir and then casually goes to my favorite ice cream place. He is a man after my heart. <3
LOVE HIM SM
YES
he's so sweet omg
I WANNA MEET HIM.. :(
he’s one of the few characters in Euphoria who just does not act themselves as irl. Huge contrast, this reassured me he’s the brightest actor in the show. much love and respect for him
Am I the only thinking this guy is freaking adorable
Te amo
His accent is kinda changing in some words
3:06-3:26 very well said!!!
when jacob took a picture of the flowers because he thought they looked nice 😭
Chồng ạ
He's just an actor, he's just an actor.
Love the actor, hate the character…. he’s that good of an actor!
He’s such a eye candy 🍭
.
انت الكول كريه
When I say this man is so fine😍😫 I mean……🥵
Good soup
by far my favorite 24 hours. didn't expect him to be so creative. love the movie clip
we love you jacob
I like to see him in movies like Vikings because his height is suitable for these movies
Which district is it?
♥️♥️♥️
he is really handsome
I always forget that he's australian lmao
this is exactly reminds me of The Legend of Heath Ledger
he's really sensitive and intelligent and he looks SO GOOD i could listen to him talk for days

His day is so chill
He seems very genuine and smart. I like him
He’s so beautiful
Best "24 Hours with" 🥺❤️
i love this man so much i am in tears
How to be that dog?
good soup
Bruh Nate Jacobs gave me PTSD almost haha Everytime I see Jacob I'm scared of him
Loxist subversion
I hope he never loses his aussie accent! So we can still claim him hahahaha
love how he's not just a pretty face
Welp looks like I’m going to go to the los Feliz movie theater everyday
what i expect is literally 24 hours of seeing jacob elordi's life ugh:(
before the film noir segment started, I thought he actually got lost in his thoughts lol that was believable
Wow. What a beautiful human being; inside and out 💜
Da he's accent. He's more hot in real life
he’s truly a sweetheart i love him as an actor
All the Euphoria cast, please!!!🤩🤩🤩
It's literally not 24 hours, it's only 9 minutes wtf😭😭💀
how 24 hours was edited into 10 minutes?
If you hate the character, it means the actor did a good job
He is so attractive oh my GOD
i’m so surprised that he is Australian ahah
He is so intelligent and kind, he is a phenomenal actor, and looks to boot.
Euphoria is over hyped
I love him
The hottest guy in H’wood rn & that’s it? Zzzzzz
He’s such a Pisces. Very dreamy, talkative poetic a bit.
El amor de mi vida 🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈
Jacob Elordi is such a hottie, portrayed one of the best characters in the show ❤✨
En español por favor
I hate Nate but i love Jacob
Besides being and excellent actor; he is a down to earth, unpretentious, humble and sincere guy!
i love how normal he is
My dog can't swim💔his so scared of water
you know that he’s a good actor when you hate the character but love the actor
soo … how does one become his girlfriend?
It's so funny to see that the same guy who plays Nate in Euphoria is the same guy who's taking a picture of the flowers, He's such a good actor!
C'est un super bon acteur il a l'aire cool sympa. Il joue tellement bien c'est rôle. 👌👌👌👌👌👍👍👍👍
He seems very nice and down to earth
How do you  interview someone for 24hrs and end up with a 9 minutes video😒
One night pls
He is soo cute ahah especially when he took pictures of them flowers ahhhh my heart 🫀💘
What a genuinely lovely person would love to have a real time chat with him.
God bless that beautiful man 🥺
good soup
You know
oh i love this man so much
can we please get a " 24 hours with Billie Eilish" ??!?!!
HE’S BRITISH????????????? WTF
https://youtu.be/cqsZEbTQx-I
He’s so dreamy 😍
MY FUTURE HUSBAND AMEEN
just watched the Batman by robert  pattinson...youtube hear me out jacob could play nightwing,,,,,,
Can we also appreciate how he’s looking at the interviewer and not the camera
forgot he was an aussie lol
“me and all my peculiarities” Jacob you’re a film buff there’s probably 100 dudes in the immediate LA area that share the same interests. Dudes love to feel different x special just like girls Lmfaooo
He has the charisma of Tom Cruise, this dude will go far
someone book this man for a movie already!!
Hey Jacob
jacob te amo
he's losing his accent and it makes me sad🥲
I love how natural he is.
yall youre hating the character that he plays you hate it cause hes good at what hes doing , in reality I LOVED HIS VIBE MATE
No one gonna talk about the good soup part 🤣
Wtf he’s British ?
Something is off about him. But I like him
HE'S SUCH A SWEETHEART OFF THE CAMERAS ID DIE TO SEE HIM BEING HIMSELF IN A MOVIE
I’m hearing multiple accents
he takes pictures of flowers
do this with angus!
Yaman vibe🥲
no one talking about how he said good soup about his coffee 🤚🏻
ok I guess I can be today years old when I found out Jacob has an accent lol
He is a golden retriever guy, who steal everyone heart.
Man I want to smoke with this dude
"Good soup" 😂❤
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABT THE GOOD SOUP
I don’t know why but there’s just something about a guy taking the time to take a picture of flowers that is so cute… this man just raised my standards 😭
The fact that he’s such a sweetie shows how exceptional he is at playing Nate
giuve provisons to lei
many / how many/ envirment/ can be
graphics
The title said 24 hrs but the video is only 9 min 47 sec long :-\
He seems so cool
Not many actors are this passionate about film. I really admire it
He’s Australian ??🤯🤯
i love how we americans say it as “you-for-e-a” and jacob says it as euphorira
I love how people know him as Nate jacobs and I know him as Noah flin
What a beautiful soul.♥️
White tee n gold chain really suites this man
He is such a great actor ! Good luck for the future Jacob but i m sure it is be bright for you ! ✨
He looks like he could have stepped out of an Old Hollywood film. Hope to see him on the big screen soon! Lovely personality. Very fun video.
First “24 Hours with” episode focused on the interview and who the actor really is behind the scenes. Everything was so creative and easy to listen to. Best wishes to this lad and I know he’s going to go even further in his career.
good soup
We NEED the film noir movie
Tadeu Smith
Jacob Elordi for Superman....I can see him in the role. He ticks all the right boxes.
Why am I suddenly so attracted to this man 👀
He’s so passionate and humble
He's so cute
The Next Batman??
🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
😘😘😘😍😍😍🥵😍🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵😋🥰🥰
😈😈😈
He deserves as a award,him, Zendaya  , Cassie , Madden and Cal.
I can easily fall in love with Jacob but also hate/murder Nate. As audience I feel like I've got spilt personality disorder lol
JE T’AIME PTN
He's so lovable!
He’s amazing
Gosh,  I love that man.
I was not ready for the GOOD SOUP comment he knows tha memes :,D
the way he took this opportunity to promote he’s friends art <33 i luv him
why do u have to write "euphoria's jacob elordi" just write "jacob elordi", we already know him
He is so handsome
do me
9:24 When he starts running 💀
oh to be that dog.
I'm literally vomiting🤢🤢🤢
He’s so pretty ugh
those peircings really suit him
You know when an actor plays his role so well their known for that role forever? Yea he's Nate Jacobs to me, in the same way Zac Efron will always be Troy and Dan as Harry Potter
TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET NEXT
my mom sent me this
him taking pictures of the flowers made my heart melt🥺
this guys got a really good head on his shoulders. you don’t see this type of humility in hollywood anymore. very admirable.
He has an ✨old rich vibe✨ aesthetics
quedé enamorada 😭😍
He seems like a cool person to be friends with
none of the actors of Euphoria have any similarities to their characters in real life - and really, that is commendable talent!
We needed this
T-T good soup
his accent
I want to be that dog
He's so out spoken, it's impressive how he express himself with so much depth
Queria se esse cachorro
when he talks about theatre and movies and Hollywood and acting, he talks with such passion and his eyes glimmer with excitement.
Im in love.
Wow the whole vibe is just perfection, now I understand
I hope he watched the worst person in the world!
GOOD SOUP
He’s such a douchebag and y’all eat it up 😂😭
Alguém legenda 🤞🏻
im wondering what movie he went to see
NEED A LIFETIME OF HIM 😭🥺
All I see is Nate Jacobs
He is what those TikTok "indie kids" strives to be.
”good soup”
omg my bf🤍🤍😮‍💨😮‍💨
1:30 his tiny feet reflection under the poolwater is so funny :)
unpopular opinion: he sounds phony and fake-ish
The good soup reference lol
I love how genuine he seems while his character is the opposite and not to mention he has phenomenal style. I love him
when he says “that’s good soup” Hahah loved that !
the cutest guy!
seeing him quote the good soup meme doing me in for some reason
the film noir sequence was actually.... alluring
“It’s good soup” 🤌🏼😅  I just love how down to earth he is. A breath of fresh air ❤️ can’t wait to see him thrive beyond euphoria.
It’s literally so hard not to match his face with the character of Nate Jacobs so i’m watching this video to permanently instill that it’s the sweet Jacob Elordi
No one: Jacob Elordi: “I think Euphori-er”
In love w this man
Am I tripping or does he have an accent!? 😂
Mi hombre, como lo amo
He’s giving Michael Phelps vibe
He has such an old soul I love it.
He sounds American sometimes but then he speaks to an American and he sounds Australian 😭
Giving Heath ledger
"you got that james dean daydream look in your eyes"
I wanted to see what he’s really like & he seems like a sweet and mellow person. I really hate Nate but I didn’t wanna hate him lol. He’s an awesome actor 🥺
Love it ... ahora necesito 24 Horas con Angus Cloud
He could be a model & he'd still fit in, he has that face for modelling, his jawline is immaculate 🤌🏽
Is no one gonna talk about the fact that he said “good soup” 😂🥰
His dimple appearing at times is so cute🥺
What is it in the Australian water that makes such fine young men?
Okay, but what is his Jeni’s order?? Also, when did Jeni’s go nationwide?!
i’m literally obsessed w him
vogue please 24 Hours with Harry Styles 🙏🏼✨💚
God he really is very cute, I mean his way of being 😍💚
His voice is, in his very own words 'surreal'
He looks like he is a really nice and sweet gentleman
❤️
Why is anyone talking about the “is good soup” he’s such a geeky sweetheart I LOVE HIM SM🤍
pitcher
Okay but what about the rolleiflex? Hello? You guys just completely glossed over what could possibly be a massive character trait???? And the Hasselblad???
i just realized as an American-born child I am so Mexican lol after watching this video
He's close in hollywood that means he's also very to his house when he did a taping in kissing booth
Jacob, if you ever see this, just know that you can come & bend me over at anytime!
such a cutie
What he says about even the worst person being in some ways formed by their beginnings/environment is so true  Not to excuse them, but to at least keep your awareness more broad
Quiero casarme con él o con alguien parecido a él Jajajaj
Quiero casarme con él o con alguien parecido a él Jajajaj
why did I think he was British 💀
He really is such a gorgeous creature❤️
not the tiktok joke 😂😂 "good soup" 💀💀
Lost a lot of respect for him for dating Olivia Jade. That shows a lot about who he is...
I DIDNT KNOW THAT HES AUSTRALIANNNNNN OMGG IM MORE IN LOVE WITH HIM L ❤ 😍
he's kinda boring
He resembles Robert Pattinson so much.
No one:  Jacob: GOOD SOUP 👍
Did anyone else hear "I'm off to the 'bitches'" in stead of the 'pictures'?
he hassssss a british accent
anyone know what sunglasses those are? heat
I can't figure out his accent
And now I'm going everyday to Los Feliz theater to casually find him there, we'll fall in love and they'll make a movie about our great love.... haha
Awww
people that believe he is like Nate......how old are you??? lol
i just want to pet that dog
He’s a beautiful boy. I just wish he would focus on his career and stop man whoring around with Hollywood bimbos like Kendall Jenner
good soup
He is truly talented but also a smart guy! he should get that big movie he dreams about soon, he deserves it.
Dont forget: how goodlooking!!!
*drool*
He’s so beautiful
He is a fine man  The way he looks carries himself and talk in love 🥰
I feel like he'd make a good batman. He has the jaw for it and he's really into film noir.
omg he’s australian ?!?!?!
im just now figuring out he has an accent
Ahhhh he quoted Adam Driver at 3:48 😂❤
i can spend 24 hours with jacob elordi without getting payed

His character on Euphoria makes my blood pressure go up. But he’s actually such a sweet heart.
He's a walking nostalgia
ily Jacob
This was amazing to watch…. His like old movie vibes 💓 old Hollywood vibes … so comforting to watch 💓
I just love seeing how passionate he gets about film and acting he's just so likable

"Good soup!" 👌
Why do they call these 24 hours when they only stay with them for half the day.
Soo immensely proud of you jacob🤩
Putin bombs nuclear station in Ukraine. The catastrophy can be bigger than Chernobyl by four times. HELP UKRAINE TO STOP WAR!!!

Loved the film noir lmao he’s cool
He is so handsome and so smart  I really like him ❤️

Lol why his accent switching to Australian, British then American 😂

This is the most Australian I’ve heard him sound.  And he is so attractive
I love Jacob so much he’s my idol.
That theater looks so romantic. I’m jelly
man’s so fineee 😍
whenever I see this guy, he talks about how much he loves movie, and that love is conveyed by the screen. Pure love toward the movie. dont change and don't lose the passion, Jacob!
Bruh if he needs someone to go to the movies with I'm down of course I live in Florida but oh well😂
Who would have known that he is Australian?!
gotta love him
GOOD SOUP AHHH

Hes sounding more American now wow, put him on the phone with another Australian and his accent would be strong as ever
HE HAS AN ACCENT WHAT
hard to believe that HE was in the kissing booth
i cant believe hes Australian whatt
I DIDNT KNOE HE HAD AN ACCENT WHAY
Such an interesting guy.. would love to hear his 73 questions.. wonder what would his answers be ❤️
He is so foineeeeee
we want 73 questions with lily collins
I can’t wait for him to get a movie role
He's so hot and after hearing that Australian accent, he's blazing hawwwwt 🥲
Fuera de todo. Eres un muy buen actor. Te  recuerdo en la serie chica rara
LO AMO ♥ SALUDOS DESDE PERÚ
I cant get over how funny his foot looks at 2:09
yujiiiiis
I love his jacket!
good soup he's literally so good at American accents like he's a naturalll
i cant get over the fact that hes actually a nice person
he seems like a calm soul
i love u so much amazing video
He’s loosing his accent🥺
I didn’t expect him to have such a warm, old soul.
I forget he’s Australian 😭😭😮‍💨
Dream man
I just found out he’s AUSTRALIAN omg
His accent is such a strange hybrid of Australian and LA. Warms my heart when the strong Aussie accent pokes through in certain words and phrases. Always love seeing a fellow  make it big.
Lmao not all the nice comments in this video THIS MAN HAS CHEATED ON SO MANY OF HIS COSTARS LMAO
ele é meu marido, só não sabe ainda, né amor?
Can't stand him
I am in love with him ❤️😭
He looks very much like Marlon Brando.
ABSOLUTE FIRE
good soup
He is so good looking
This man can be a poet
the cutest person all around
The doggg
Ugh his so fineeeeee 😍😍
He really just got chocolate ice cream that’s wild asf 😂😂😂😂
Major Cancer man vibes
Good Soup
I think he's a gem along side with new gen actors zendaya and timothee chalamet
wow 😍
such a darling
Good soup
I laughed when he said good soup
love him sm
celeb crush --
“Good sUp” 😂😂😂
But can I go to the theater with him tho🥺
Jacob is the love of my life, literally
Good soup 🍜
He gives me an Edward Cullen vibe 😍
I really liked him in the kissing booth but euphoria shows his dark off side which is complex as an actor you can do both!
tall, dark and handsome 😍
proud of him!  Good to see an Aussie smashing it!
Great, now I’m in love with him
My man ✨
I’m in love 😍
I will just say he does a fantastic job of playing the villain because I can’t look at him and think I wanna punch him in the face because he plays Nate so well. He’s gonna go places
Jacob you’re so talented I can’t wait to see you acting in more films or series, you genuinely seem like such a down to earth humble man and I love it. ❤️😍
He’s such a comforting person 💕
Amazing view of the Hollywood sign 😃 The fact that he was basically homeless before making it big. I love him for staying humble and not turning into the hot mess of bad and boujee of Hollywood.  He will go far definitely. He has proven more than talented to be type cast. He can make you love and hate him that well 😏
Boring.
Want more questions. Cute dog 🐶
Jacob is our typical Aussie bloke. Good to see he is super laid back and hope that Hollywood won’t change him drastically
he did not just say "good soup"
I’m so in love with this man
So is he not actually bisexual?
Why they called this “24 hours with” if the video only last 10 minutes? 😩
When he said good soup 😂😂
I absolutely loved this. More like this. I'm writing a novel set in Los Feliz, so I appreciate that as well.
i clicked for the dog
I would kill to see him and timothée Chalamet interview each other.
Oh God, I'm in love with this man
it's so nice to see him as a sweet soft man sometimes i forget that nate is just a character after all💀
Top 5: Bad Things to be with a RUSSIAN WOMAN... https://youtu.be/YSZ0VvFbu24
Its all your fault Nate
Você é um ator sensacional.  merece ser um dos melhores atores do  mundo todo ❤❤❤ eu te amo muito  jacob 🇧🇷
One thing he said is right, now a days people don't make movies thats will be seen in theatre or cinema. I guess this decade could be the last of people visiting theatre to watch good movies. Ott took over and has left so many unnecessary choices
He has an old school classic handsome Hollywood look
Парень который фоткает цветочки, просто можно мне такого😭❤
He is such a good actor in euphoria and the way I find myself hating him while he isn't nate means it's a good sign but he should get more roles and not the kissing booth ffs he is so much better then that film
Nate: very violent and disturbed person  Jacob: stops to take pictures of flowers
That was probably a dream he had when he was a kid
I don't know him but omg how he can be this handsome?
when he played with his dog i was melting
Wait what he has an accent
So... 4 hours?
Love the aesthetic of the video!
yep i am smiling like an idiot throughout this vid, thanks jacob
The Adam driver reference😹
He needs to write a movie, be in the movie and film it in black and white. he really has a face for black and white
Let’s put this man in a Theater Film! He deserves it! So kind ❤️
ily
LOL "good soup" bye i cannot w him
😘😘😘😘🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😘😘😘
I'VE BEEN A HUGE FAN OF JACOB ELORDI FOR YEARS NOW SINCE THE FIRST KISSING BOOTH CAME OUT BUT IN 2 DAYS I'M DROPPING A COMEDY VIDEO ON JACOB ELORDI SO SEE YOU ON MY CHANNEL 😂😂😂🚀
Had no idea he has an accent lol
#1❤
I love him that’s all 💗
3:46 good soup
I would love to see him in a noir film. He has that classic 20s-60s energy that is rare these days in young actors.
He actually seems quite the opposite of his character.
Do the 71 question! I want to know more about him 💕
the "it's good soup" just verified jacob he has tiktok
He is an old soul and down to earth ✅
He looks so sweet 😭
Dios mío lo amo, quisiera abrazarlo
Jacob is like me but in a male version
So are we just gonna ignore the fact he said “good soup” 😃
Terrible actor??? Then how did he get me to hate Nate Jacob's???
Crazy seeing "ur internet mom" viewers watching this 😂😂😭
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
It’s official my favorite video online
it says 24 hours yet we get 9 minutes smh
GOOD SOUP
they say “24 hours with” and then the video isn’t 24 hours long??? false advertising???
I love him wow
He kind of looks like a young version of Mr. Big (Chris Noth)!
seems more of like a 73 qs kinda thing
He reminds me of Dave Franco
🤰
What pants are those? I need them
GOOD SOUP
Good soup 💅
You know in Hercules, when Meg says "Is Wonderboy here for real?" when she meets Hercules? Yeah, that question is applicable here <3
Jacob está demasiado divino, y su mente también me parece que está divina.
I’ll go to the movies with u Jacob 😫🥲
"GOOD SOUP"
God https://youtu.be/fSSkCA2xyVk 2
if Matthew Mcconaughey and Grayson Dolan had a child that would be Jacob
i love him so much
we need a 24 hours with Harry Styles or 73 questions with him
1 man 17 accents
ouu im gna marry this man like fr
he will get his movie premiere
HES AUSTRAILIAN????!!!!😮😍 ughhh I love Australian accents
thanks for interviewing my bf !!!
I have the same routine 😭
Did we all just collectively fall in love with Jacob Elordi?
what a sweetheart! he’s also a great actor!!
The fact that I hate Nate makes him a great actor
Jacob is such a beautiful human being
He is so sweet and pure I love him
Yall... I would have never known he wasn't American 💀💀
1:13 sometimes you just want to be a dog
Good soup? he watche tiktok 😳
Lol when he said good soup 😭
For some reason I can see him playing Superman or some type of superhero in the marvel or dc universe 🔥
Wtf is euphoria
You can't tell me he wouldn't be a perfect Scott Summers
I'm honesty so in love with this man<3
He's such an old soul <3
he is just so fine
I just want to have a date with him, sorry I'm in love...
He is so nice
Very beautiful dog🐕😍
Just look how 4:56 rlly changes into this kind of dude 6:28
Iconic Hollywood
He looks like Tom cruise
He is amazing. His presence is so humble and grateful. He deserves to star in a huge film soon so he can really break into film. If he does not receive an Emmy for his performance on Euphoria, I would be so surprised. Without his character, the show would not be as iconic as it is. So amazing to know that he is as good of a person as he is as an actor. Loved this Vogue!
He is such an old soul. I would have never thought.
aw seeing him get Jenis and walk through los feliz made me homesick! cant wait to go back!
He is the most beautiful man my goodness
just my man ❤ love you jacob
Interesting him & so many other actors have a accent in real life but in there movies speak perfect American English.
i just can say he is interesting
Jacob has really watched alot of movies and understands movies at a deeper level....he's done alot of research and study on his craft you can tell....kudos to him....actually this video surprised me cause I heard that he was a good actor but dint know that he knew so much about films👏🏼👏🏼
3:48 AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YEAHHHHHHHHHHHH HE PULLED THAT ADAM DRIVER DIALOGUE PERFECTLY MAN
hated jacobs, loved jacob
“Good soup” lmao
The fact that he could be this generations ‘James Dean’ is crazy full circle for him. He’s a great actor!
God I’ve never wanted to be a dog so badly
you call that a 24 hours spent with jake?
I love you Jacoooob ❤️💐
So did he just let us know he lives in Los Feliz lol
Es muy dulce❤️
Yess
More like The Kissing Booth's Jacob Elordi
Him in euphoria: 🔪🔫🚬🖤 Him in real life: 🥰🐶🥑💛
omg he's British!!
“good soup” A MAN OF CULTURE lmao
he lived in the VALLEY?!
It's not 24 hours. It's 9 minutes
He’s really Australian
Totally forgot that he's Australian.
My celebrity crush 😁💗
am i the only one who thinks he’s loosing his aussie accent?
Sooooooo fucken fine !!!! Wow his voice is so soothing!!!
He has such a unique American/ aussie hybrid accent
he's so cute
He is really cool thou
J'AIME CE MEC 😩
I would pay anything to see Jacob make his own film noir.
Can you plz do a 73 question interview with Miley Cyrus
He is VALID for recognizing the television and streaming service entertainment isnt as significant as being in a motion picture! He is 100% correct
Cool man and beautiful dog.
He’s such a gentleman🥺
It’s so fascinating seeing who he actually is, the way that he portrays the various characters he’s given is so convincing. He obviously is absolutely full of talent!
I just wanna know what movie he saw.
“good soup” 😌 we love an educated man
So In kissing booth when Elle and Noah where at the Hollywood sign they were looking at jacobs house 🤨
His run at the end I love him
He's going to do BIG things. Bright future ahead for him...
I love him! He’s so calm, and relaxing.
I'm used to seeing his face in Euphoria and wanting to punch him but he's actually so cute 🥺 the way he's always looking down and his shy gestures
I want to see him in a film adaptation of Evelyn Hugo! Could totally see him as one of the husbands (maybe Don?)
Jacob are you an INFJ? Because I am getting those vibes.
i was right, only chicks simpin over him in the comments
Omg I love him!!!!!
PLEASE CAN YOU DO THIS KIND OF VIDEO WITH LOUIS PARTRIDGE
I enjoyed this videos and  love his clothes so simple, clean, and good combined, the way we dress says a lot about us
Really shows that when you’re attractive, people really believe in you so much more than you deserve. Playing a brooding jock with almost no dialogue doesn’t equate to Brando.
Whoever color graded this did a stellar job
He was definitely written by a woman lol
Jacob really passionate about acting and hope we can see him in big movie soon 🙏🏻
HE'S SO COOL
I can see it coming. He’ll be an icon like Marlon Brando.
…I’m…so… he’s soo… wow
Moonknight Month… https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x7Krla_UxRg
He seems like such an old soul 🥺
So chill
Love you Jacob!!!! Keep going
Jesus, what a man
Who chose the freakin font and font color for the intro wtf
still a boring cis white male actor, next
U r lucky u didn’t meet Cal
He moves like an old classic soul. I bet if he clenched his jaw and glared right at me I’d think he’s Nate. He’s such a great actor!
WHEN THE DOGGY WENT INTO THE POOL AHHHH
He’s so cute
You can tell he’s the next It boy in Hollywood
i'm sorry but where's my 24 hours with jacob elordi that wasn't 24 hours???
BARTUUUUUUU
good soup....aaa im ded
I hope he likes the lads.  Anyone know if he does
💘
Very good actor and also a snack
I could see him as Batman
3:47 bye.
GOOD SOUP
Why are vids with the female cast members always ‘makeup routines’ and yet Jacob gets to talk about films and his passions and career goals…?
he aspires to be a director 🕊
love him
He said 'good soup' !!!!!  I am screaming 😭😱
24 hours?? That was like 3 talks
hes so different😭😭
this is not 24 hours, is just him speaking stuff on a afternoon soot
Of course he British
His attitude is so relaxing 😌
I remembered something on that "Hollywood" thing..hmmm haha
✨😊✨
he looks like young tom cruise i think
I could literally just listen to him talk about anything for hours
I love him soo much 💖💖💖💖💗💗💗💗💗💗😫😫😫😫😫
I love him soo much 💖💖💖💖💗💗💗💗💗💗😫😫😫😫😫
He is so well spoken and humble!
Just thankyou Vogue 🙌 amazing short film tho
I hate Nate Jacobs so much that sometimes I forget Jacob is actually really nice
That’s how interesting people look like !
i love u
That was not 24 hours
I LOVE this mans voice! 💗
HES BRITISH?!?!?!?!?!
He seems like such a genuine guy. Fantastic actor.
that wasn’t 24hours
Only watchingt this to convince myself he's not a bad peron unlike the characters he's playing
you're a social climber LOL
Hi Jacob. 😛
I want to marry this man.
I feel bad for hating him so much 😂
hehhh ganteng bgt
I don't know i just love him. ❤️
He's so cute and sweet that makes me wanna cry. It's so amazing to see how he's such a good actor and does such a good perfomance of Nate. He's so so sweet and adorable, I hope he has all his dreams achieved!
great actor. So inspiring. I also love watching movies alone. If I had a local cinema I'd probably go everyday.
He sounds Australian then American
i love you
this looks like a movie in itself. ❤️‍🔥
He is so a Sweethart and feel so shy in front of Camera! Your fans love you♥️!
I like him since i saw kissing booth ❤️
why are there so many bots here....
And he seems like a big kid.. A handsome one.
This makes me think that  I can become an actress too…but I don’t know where to start I’m just a girl living in Germany currently writing my a-levels but the goal is there and Jacob is my inspiration <3
Surprised you didn’t ask why he cheated on joey king and zendaya 💀
cinematography and coloring are stunning!
Made a video with Jamie dornan like that 🙂
good soup
Thank you Jacob for showing the public that you can go see a movie by yourself
Ummmm early?!
please make more about Barbara palvin.i like her very much.i want to know her lifestyle 😇🌜
this guy...  this feels like I’ve been listening about myself, man we have the same dream, I think the same about the film noir
The weather always looks so perfect there.
why do I feel like he‘s holding back his true personality? Like he‘s always close to be himself and then tries to act cool for the camera. I would actually love to see his quirky side
He is male perfection! It's not easy playing a bad guy when IRL he's obviously not a bad guy.
Honestly, he kind of resembles marlon brando, especially around his mouth and brows during the film noir part !!
His accent is such a strange hybrid of Australian and LA. Warms my heart when the strong Aussie accent pokes through in certain words and phrases. Always love seeing a fellow 🇦🇺 make it big.
Yeah it’s kinda crazy how he hasn’t been in a film yet. So far it’s only been stuff on streaming services.
Why are British people so good at faking American accents
Whenever i see jacob and the hollywood sign i always remember him in the kissing booth
Euphoria really allows him to show his skills. I'm just hoping with the right agent and the luck on his side, he'll be the next Hollywood it boy soon
WHAT?? HE WAS SUPPOSED TO PLAY ORSON WELLES??? WHERE??? MANK?? thats crazy he would have been great
I wish I could talk to him. Just a long conversation and some coffee.
he’s so beautiful
he is such a wholesome man 🤍
the fact that his character in euphoria is such an awful person, but he seems so genuine irl shows what a good actor he is
Dạ ck
Was he in London on Saturday, I swear I saw someone that looks just like him
You guys really delivered! *insert applause* thank you x
He's so humble and down to earth 😌
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤
He looks like matpat
Charming beautiful man
Hes so down to earth
"Good soup" lmfao
Why must i fall for him? I already have too many guys I've fallen for. Eh who cares I LOVE JACOB!!
You can see that his accent is fading away, which is sad :(
I know he's just acting. After Euphoria, he scares me a lot 😨
I need one of this with the icon herself, miss Alexa Demie
The video is very cool. One of my favorite bloggers. By the way, I shoot minecraft. Unfortunately, no one notices me for a very long time. If it's not difficult for you to go to my channel and like the latest video, and maybe even subscribe if you like it. THANK YOU SO MUCH IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR CHANNEL. By the way, I’ll take something interesting for 250 subscribers) Therefore, you can still subscribe because of this. See you in the comments below the video. TILL!
I see dog, I click but then there's Jacob. It's really not an option to not click anymore
what a man! i already liked him as an actor but seeing how well spoken he is and insightful, he’s great
It's really hard to hate Nate because of him
even though he's lost a bit of his accent, he's still an aussie at heart. seems like your typical genuine, laidback guy. i didn't realize he was so passionate about acting! there's no way he won't make it big with his attitude and talent. his continual search for growth and ambition surprisingly inspired me in this short video. good luck to him, i think the best is yet to come
I'm Australian and I seem to be the only one who thinks he isn't all that good looking. But he is a good actor. 👍
I'm just shocked by the quality it's like watchin' a movie
His character as Nate really traumatized me but In real life he's a very humble and simple man!🤌🏼
He is so handsome 😍and yummy 🤤
His accent is weird. It goes between sounding really English and then really Australian.
Someone get this man in a really good movie
I hope he watched “The worst person in the world”
Wow he’s like the complete opposite of Nate
I love the way he dresses
Este chico tiene algo.!! He dicho 🙌🏻❤️
https://youtu.be/37sqgm8m6Cw
omg may i know what camera that is? it looks so cool
he is such Good actor. Nate scared me alot
He's everything that Nate Jacobs isn't
NEW CELEBRITY CRUSH UNLUCK
I think he’d be great in a remake of American Psycho
I am hungry
The kissing booth didn’t do this man enough justice ✨
I can’t unsee Nate in him 😭🥺
24 hours with Alexa demie
Just as traumatic as I thought
he did not just say 'good soup' in a vogue interview 😅
Im in love😌❤️‍🔥
That house looks tiny bcoz he's tall
💕
When you click on a video do quiz you nearly break your screen 😩
GOOD SOUP 👌🏽
Nate Jacobs 😡🔪💀❌😡❌ Jacob Elordi 💗🥰😚😘💓💖
The dog is the BEST part ❤️❤️❤️ What a little sweetheart
He can be the next Josh Hartnett.
Love the insight on trauma and so so important that you talk about that with empathy. It’s not an easy road but it takes someone special to understand that.
I hope you never lose that passion in that kind of industry
god he’s soo good ,and this video look like old movie 💥💥
You are really good at euphoria, your acting is superior
The most beautiful human being
He is more attracted to me as a Nate
I am here because his chemistry with sydney sweeney at euphoria  is soooo addicting and now i am catching up with their individual contents
Jacob is a great actor.
He's so good at playing the bad guy, I almost lost my cool when he pulled a Russian Roulette on Maddy.
Omg he's Australian?
Distracted by the water's distortion of his foot at 2:10 😂
He seems like a great actor
Hahahahha the film noir clip is brilliant!!!
Yeah ima be posted up at los Feliz for the foreseeable future
I think Im in love with him
Me: watching this Also my brain: you fvcking nate, are u kidding me?
Did anyone else swoon when he was loving on his doggy? Such a good guy!
I don't know but for me you obviously can see that he is not very proud of his kissing both experience .. when he said he didn't actually make a movie yet .. but maybe I just got it wrong but anyway you really truly saw his Talent in Euphoria he's an amazing actor and Im very excited what his next projects going to be :)
He gives me kendall jenner vibe
HIM HAVING A PAINTING DONE BY A FRIEND INSPIRED BY BUFFALO 66…wouldn’t expect this much taste honestly
Vogue: 24 Hours with Euphoria's Jacob Elordi Vogue again: Gives us just 9mins video😣😣
he was written by a woman
Because of the character Nate jacobs I ended up hating the real jacobs because I was so sucked into the series and now watching this I finally see that he’s not really like that😂😂
3248 canyon lake drive, los angeles?
I can never hate this man except for euphoria💀💀
He’s so handsome! He has that dreamy effect just like James Dean.
At 1.20 he has really small feet 😂
You know that Euphoria will be super boring if there is no Nate Jacobs.
He is sooooooooo handsome 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕 Love you 😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
He’s so calm and collected
He likes Seinfeld thats a good sign ;)
aww he looks so nice
He’s that one who looks like could kill you, is a cinnamon roll 😂
Такой вайбовый
He's a great actor. He literally made me hate the character of Nate jacobs so much. But it's so refreshing to see his humble personality.
Idk why but I feel tall watching this video
Is he… camera shy???? 🙀
Is that Jacob is a playboy in real life real?
How old is he? I feel like I've seen his face on things for a dacade now
Nate’e hayatimda kimseye sinirlenmedigim kadar cok sinirlendim allah belani versin Nate
He’s really a good actor, and so smart!
Dynamic actor
is…is the dog Australian too
This was beautifully made.
Trying to humanize Nate before he gets worse in season 3...
Oh to be that dog
*https://youtu.be/duKHg_bAqTw* _🔥🔥🔥🔻.🖤🔥🖤.🔺🔥🔥🔥_ *https://youtu.be/duKHg_bAqTw*
Love him
He said good soup😭
Talented and beauty
“Good soup” AHAHAHAHAHA
I really want to know what movie he saw
He is so talented
he is never gonna be a movie star, he is too tall
He can play so many different characters, he’s going to continue to be an amazing actor
loved to see more of Jacob’s personality. He has a chill and genuine vibe. cant wait to see what’s next for him🙌
I know Nate is a character he plays, but I'm still scared of him. I guess this is a testimony to his acting.
he’s so pretty
im in love with him
😭❤️
😍😍😍
love himm
Thank god he went past the Kissing Booth movies and let his talent shine in Euphoria! I‘m really excited to see him in future roles
Bc Nate is so f’ed up, I’m glad to see that Jacob is cool and nice haha.
I'M SO IN LOVE
who was gonna tell me he’s Australian 💀
He is so talented and underrated. It’s crazy to think that he hasn’t gotten any silver screen role as yet
Am I the only one who  can't watch  euphoria or didnt watch euphoria?
sorry but if I served him ice cream and he told me he appreciated me I'd go feral
You can clearly see how much Jacob adores the world of cinema and theatre, and hearing all those little tales of him slowly getting into this world and everything tells that he was made for it
He is such a wonderful actor. Plus, finally a man in a vogue video. All I see is women so I’m glad there is something different.
I loved Nate Jacobs because of Jacob.
One take away is that jacob is adorably old school
So crazy how in the show you can’t hear his accent! Such an amazing actor I love him 😍
wsp with this title.
matpat?
Jacob Elordi must be protected at all costs.
I’m excited to see Jacob go on the big screen! He’s come such a long way in such a short amount of time
omg I can’t stop smiling watching him, he’s cute as always ❤️
that's good soup
“Euphorier”
When he stopped to take a picture of flowers 🥺 he’s so precious!
Wow he’s great
I have the biggest crush on him 😫😫
They really did ruin this poor with that role!Like I can’t trust him,he looks like he’s still in character(the secret sociopath who acts like a good guy)😂😂😂
i’m sorry but he’s so fine
the kiss sound...
Watched this cause Nate is scary 😟 but Jacob seems so sweet 🥲 totally someone I’d be friends with irl
He could play Robert Pattinson's brother in a movie
i saw this video yesterday when it was posted and i can’t stop watching, i love jacob elordi so much he’s amazing.
Good actor ! Pathetic vocabulary, What is this like like like you know like like , more like Kylie Jenner like like  Am fed up of this word like
perfect bone structure would do well on te silver screen...
u can tell he has a true passion for film
That jacket is fire!!!!!
good soup hahahaha
that noir thing went hard ngl
“Good soup” 💀
He actually seems like a cool guy
AND HE IS A DOG LOVER TOO!? SAY LESS
am i catching feelings for him? hehehehhe..... nyes......
God I am in love with this man
Y’all are gonna hate me for this & don’t come for me but in my opinion if he would’ve stopped after the first “kissing booth” film I feel like he would’ve been casted for some major roles. I feel like after doing the kissing booth 2 it was just beneath his acting skills.
this delivered
obsessed
he looks like an anime character
he's genuine and i hope he'll be in many great movies
his Australian accent kicking in >>>>
So handsome 😍
Can’t believe I’m older than him!
It looks like he's a really nice guy!!!)
Jacob's just a sweet and genuine person tbh. He's such an amazing person as a human.  Love the  way he's calm and can literally pull off any  character he's given but Nate?!!
My bby
he ate i fear
I love this man so much
“I think I make a pretty mean cup of joe”…..”ahh” “good soup👋🏻”
ohh the cameraaa 🤍
He’s still such an Aussie! Love how he’s getting so famous and living in LA but still has his true blue Aussie accent 👏🏼👏🏼
He’s so fine omgggg
GIVE US WHAT THE PEOPLE WANT JACOB SHIRTLESS
HIS ACCENT OMG
GOOD SOUP
omg i can see some similarities in him <3
3:48 DID HE JUST SAY GOOD SOUP?!?!?💀💀💀
I love how he's so passionate about film and acting
Jacob is so talented, so down to earth, so sweet. He is a great actor - he literally made all of us hate Nate Jacobs. I think only good actor can do it ❤️ I think he deserves EMMY along with Sydney Sweeney for the season 2 Euphoria
The psychotic lily lovely guess because jury individually boast outside a overt gearshift. willing, distinct taxi
I'm sorry he is so CUTE
Love him, but aren’t we going to talk about the aesthetics of this video? It is magnificent!
He gives off such Dad vibes ngl
His a fine Actor. Talented and a Natural.. His got face of an art yall
“Euphoriar”
7:45 😭 i love him
I change my mind hes not overated. 😳
Call me crazy but I could see him in a dc film…
*Good soup~*
He was in that Netflix show, right? Photo booth?
Pick me boy for sure
hes so elegant . id love to just have lunch with him and just talk
Lol it’s so crazy to see the guys that plays a Narcissist psychopath actually talk and be genuine, just freaking me out a little 🤣
"it's good soup"
jacob so cute, need him!
good soup
why is no one mentioning when he said “good soup”
He’s such a terrible person in the show which makes him such a good actor!!!!!! So incredible
loz feliz cinema is gonna be surprisingly busy now
I started loving Jacob after seeing Kissing booth but after Euphoria not so much. The bottom line is he is a good actor. He knows how to fit into the character.
He’s so fine
i love the "good soup"💀
oh to be that girl that gave him the ice cream cone
Ahhh his Australian accent is slowly going American 🥲
This man is so precious and genuine.
he has something called "artist" in him. his interest is very aesthetic.
He really is an amazing actor. He deserved to be in a class movie. Hopefully soon he himself and we all gonna see him in a class movie🙌🙏 and we all watch it in theater. The thing that I like most about him is that he seems like someone who really loves the art called  Acting, Movies and all. He is not here for money and fame but for his love and passion for Art and movies🙌  All the best and Good Luck Jacob.🙌👍 Looking forward to see you in movies.
May all your dreams come true! They will, I can feel it! Cool guy.
I’m so in love with him
the way he talks ab his character + the show n empathy wow
He’s handsome and smart. Exactly what Hollywood wants 🤩
PLS I LOVE JACOB
I want to be that icecream gal
I enjoyed this way too much.  I thought I loved Dylan O’Brien.
Lucky dog
Boyfriend material
thats a black king
que pinche guapo alv
he looks like marlon brando omg
Good soup….quoting the Girls break up 🥰 even with the hand gesture…that scene is not talked about enough and I’m sure Jacob would age
He looked so precious when he was holding his ice cream😭💕
All I could think about is Michael Scarn in Threat Level midnight during his film noir scene 🤣
Where can I find a man like him to date…and possibly marry?😂
Um.. I think I have a new crush 😣😅
<3
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow what a charmer he’s incredible 🥺❤️❤️
Such a Humble guy
OMGGGGH
omg he’s adorable.. yes his character on Euphoria sucks?! BUT JACOB IS TOO KIND AND ADORABLE!
Cassie girlie i think i get it😭😩😩
It’s weird seeing him nice..
I love him so much
This man is absolutely gorgeous, and I love his style. I love his little hoop earrings and those rings! Plus he's an amazing actor, I'm sure he's bound to become huge after Euphoria.
Does he need another dog I can bark
GOOD SOUP
Wait he has a accent??
Saw the title my first thought: why
i'm not in love your in love <3
He sounds kinda boring
I love this guy.
Every time I see him all I can think of a young Matt Dillon. I could see him play his brother or son in a movie. Plus, it does not hurt that he's a fantastic actor like Matt Dillon.
the most charming human ever
He don't need euphoria tag on it 😶
Hi Vogue, Do you guys like China Money? :) America must be very proud of you haha
Jacob te amo, no entiendo nada de lo que dices pero eres tan aesthetic, saludos
Awkward
Okay when he took the photo of the flowers 🥺❤️ so sweet.
He could be superman
He's such a sweetheart
insatiable
I wish they didn't show his favorite theatre. He's going to be stalked now ;( sad sad world.
Tan lindo
He’s such a humble person.
did he just jaywalk at the end?
man he is so dreamy
Jacob you are immensely talented. Wow.
He is so cute and charming.
Bla bla bla
Him playing nate.. This kid has True talent. He needs to be in a big movie as the main actor I bet he'd blow it outa the water.
Counting on how many times he said "you know"
Omg I love him I stop to take pictures at flowers too😂
Mi futuro marido 💘
Jacob Elordi + ice cream = YES, PLEASE! ***note to self: watch movies at Los Feliz theatre 🎭
🖤🤍
the tiny gold hoop earrings on him is making me feel things...
Anyone know what’s the music at the beginning of the video?
A beautiful man
DREAMY 💕
24 Hours with Cody Fern
holy
The fact that he's so likeable and laid back proves his acting ability. You'd think he'd be the opposite had you just watched him play Nate.
He is such a gem 🤍
he’s a phenomenal actor. if you don’t like his character then he’s doing something right, hate the character love the actor
What’s the tune that starts at 3:35?
He's a film need aww
Oh god 🥺thanku so much was waiting since long ❤️
So excited to him grow. Can't wait to see him on the big screens
He's great on euphoria. Hope to see more of him.
Does anyone know where he went to acting school?
King
he’s passionate actor!!!
❤
I thought this was matpat
I need see TIMOTHEÉ CHALAMET!!
The good soup meme he said lmao
the good soup lmao
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH!!!💕😩
Jacob will definitely be making movies I can’t wait to see🥰
I wonder what kind of filter they used here.
Season 2 was a wild ride but overall way less organized and connected than season 1, so I hope they go back to being more consistent. Nate and Cal's actors are excellent.
My mom is gonna love this guy
Ahhhh he has a golden! I do too. Mine is a bit bigger though, and blonde! Goldens are the best.
i need to know what film he saw
He kind of reminds me of Paul McCartney..it’s definitely the baby face :)
Good soup
I would spend more than 24 hrs with him
He’s so pure
Love this!
jacob is one beautiful man
He is precious
guys i think his australian accent is long gone.
someone give this man a leading role in a blockbuster film NOW
There IS a spot on the Strip that you can see the Hollywood sign...
24hrs is definitely not enough
0:10 i rebuke, yall should never joke like that
He is adorable I love him.
love him
It is really a great performance where these 'villains' make their characters so hateworthy that it's just so hard to even believe that they are an actually delightful and lovely person in reality. The last character I remember is Joffrey being so abhorrent. Laurie was great too this season past. Pretty much everyone is perfectly cast in this show but Nate's arc is intriguing indeed.
So refreshing to see someone so young and good looking to be so grounded and laid back ❤️
The finale got me mad the little kid dying and his brother like that ugh I didn’t like it! I cried about it lol like it was happening for real!
good soup
Every time I see him I am reminded that I fall in love far too easily 😭
BABAHAHAH GOOD SOUP dude is so freaking funny WHAT
Good to see bro is nothing like Nate Jacobs. Cool dude.
What's  up Doc?  https://youtu.be/2XY6B1peCrc  2
This man looks like a golden retriever
he is just so calm and sweet, and such a normal human! love it
Preset lut that so aestetic
He portrayed Nate so well, Nate and Jacob are two very two different people
Oh this was great
I see him as our next Christian Bale
Hate Nate, love Jacob 🥰
TANGINA MO KALA MO MAPAPATAWAD KITA HAYOP KA TANGINA MO NATE KASALANAN MO LAHAT NG YARI KAY MADDY PATI KAY CASSIE😭😭💀😭😡😠😭😠😠😠😠
im actually in love with this man
Great actor, and he apparently is of Basque descent...wow! ¡Y no tiene la nariz vasca!
he seems like a really nice guy!!
The "good soup" made me scream hahahah
I’m sorry his obvious a good person but he still has Nate Jacob’s face😭
Good soup
“Good Soup” 💀
He is so dreamy 😍💕💕💕💕💕
pls i want him now
oh hes quite precious isnt he
🙌
The way he has to look down at the interviewer because of how tall he is
HES SO FINEEEE OMG
Who said he's a terrible actor? I just wanna talk.
I love him ❣️
subhanallah
Love the golden!
Nuclear radiation going to all people around worlds
oh he's... smart
He just seems so genuinely stoked and humbled to be where he is and it's so nice to see. Hate Nate, Love Jacob!
Omg he's not American?? Dang he's phenomenal
Omg i live for him is he bi?
Bold person
His smiles kinda look like Joey King
فجر خرقي
The girl giving him his ice cream was all of us, if we got to be in her shoes
I LOVE him he’s so sweet and it just contrasts with his big daunting appearance. Such great vibes ♥️
He's not Nate Jacobs, okay???
He's not Nate Jacobs okay??

Qué hombre para más atractivo en todo sentido ! 😌
HE IS AMAZING AND THE MOST ATTRACTIVE HUMAN ALIVE
He seems like such a nice guy! cant wait to see his future roles
*I can **_definitely_** see him playing Batman someday... or at least some superhero in the MCU or DC universe*
He had my pannie till he said “good soup” like 🤨🤨

He is a loner . I can tell

He’s a social climber
Its so crazy how his accent goes in and out and he really good at playing a character with an american voice
SO PROUD OF YOU JACKIEE🔥🔥
his energy is so calming. i love this 🥰
If they ever make a movie about gabby petito and Brian this guy needs to play Brian. Not only does he kind of look like him but he's a great actor.

He's so sweet :) I love him💓

Anyone know what watch he’s wearing

Dude is 6'5 giant 😂
HE HAS AN ACCENT ?
love you so much jacob 🥺🤧
I love how passionate he is about film noir movies and acting, I don’t think you see too many actors/actresses who have this passion for old time movies. I love his aura and aesthetic it’s so classy and very timeless♥️
"that's good soup."
3:46 BWAHAHAHHAHA
I can see him becoming a blockbuster actor just like he wants to be
That dog is Mr. Peanutbutter and he's gonna steal the "D" in Hollywood
Sounds like his accent is fading hahaha
He is so tall. Very handsome. Even as Nate (runs and hides) lol. Yes, I know Nate sucks but he is still good looking.
love him
Terrible interview and not at all 24 hours
love jacob so much! excellent actor he is
We’re getting there, Nate. We’re so proud of what you have achieved and what you will achieve soon!
Being that attractive should be illegal.
So glad he’s known for euphoria now and not kissing booth
His house looks like the house in GTA that I went to because I was bored
I forgot he had an accent
he had to remind people he's actually a nice guy in real life lmao
Yesss
I wanna be that dog
is no one going to talk about when he said "good soup". come on!!
He’s such a sweetheart 🥺
i love him so much
Okay....watching this video made me realize he's a good actor. I needed the contrast 😂
I had no idea he was Australian 😂😂
Ugh he’s just so cute & sweet, it hurts 😮‍💨
Casi no tiene contacto visual con las personas, solo cuando actúa, igual es muy guapo ese hombre❤️‍🔥
He’s so cute 🥺 good soup lol
1st season was perfect and 2nd season was horrible
he’s so beautiful GOD
This is so aesthetic lol
He reminds me of Matt Dillon
don’t confuse nate the character with jacob elordi the actor

awwww he seems so sweet
“Good Soup” I’m dead😭💀
I just love seeing how passionate he gets about film and acting he's just so likable
How to fall in love in 9:47 minutes 🤍
So well spoken
I didn't like him before coz of kissingbooth I DIDN'T HATE HIM i just thought he was just like another actor yknow??? But he's did so good on euphoria!! Like OMG I HATE NATE SO MUCH HAHAH
I hope to see him in greater roles. He is an amazing actor and deserves to explore his talent.

I teach the truth about the Holy Bible on Snapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/mttracks. Support your fellow Hebrew Israelite on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/mttracks?fan_landing=true -MTTRACKS
He seems really down to earth and kind. He's incredible in Euphoria. I hope he gets to be in a big movie that he's always wanted to do!!
If you hate Nate he did an amazing job, that’s how you know he’s a great actor.
💙💙💙💙💙
Not him saying good soup 😭
he is beautiful!
his house is beautiful
lol 24 hours 🧐 or four 😂
why is it that the dark knight intrigues so many actors now to want to pursue it when they were younger lol? same thing with timothee chalamet
everybody say thank you vogue
He is an outstanding actor! Learning to follow your dreams is what it means to live full out!
Good on you for reaching your dreams and knowing the struggle of the poor and moving up in the world. Must be a trip.
This man is literally so adorable.
Is that Ice cream girl okay? I would not be if he leaned into me like that
Are y’all forgetting he cheated on zendaya 😁
I f@ck with his style
i gotta say i was pretty startled when i heard that aussie accent
3:48 DID HE JUST DID HE REALLY JUST DID THAT? HE’S ON TIKTOK
GOOD SOUP

THIS INTERVIEW IS A MASTERPIECE
Something about a rly big dude standing in front of a colorful cute ice cream shop with ice cream in his hand is so endearing 😂
Its hard to act like he does , I'm so impressed 💗 can't wait next season
He’s so hot. I cant take it.
Well he’s about to stalked by people at his favorite places lol
hes so cute!
he’s literally my boyfriend omg
Him saying “Good Soup” was the cherry on top
It's always so interesting to see the actors/actresses in real life.
😂😂
HOLD UP HE’S AUSTRALIAN?! No wayyyyy
Soo nice ☄🖤
3:37 i think he has tiktok
He's just so - I CAN'T 💐💞💞✨✨✨🧎🏽‍♀️🧎🏽‍♀️
Like it’s so weird to not hate every part of him on screen!! ❤️❤️❤️ amazing acting bc of it!!
the “good soup” was my favourite part out of the whole video
Jacob Elordi for Scream 6! 😍
The way he said Go actually melted my heart 💓🥺
surprised dude's Australia looked like typical American jock lol
Very talented actor and charming guy!
love him sm
He truly loves what he does. Genuine, raw passion. This inspired me so much.   & the film noir but was a good touch lol
I’m just taking a picture of these flowers, they’re really nice flower 🌸
He doesn’t have an American accent? 🤯
good soup ☕️
He could be a great batman , someday
Ugh he’s so handsome
God what a man
Man's side profile really said 🌜
24 hours with Jacob Elordi, in a 9.5 minutes video felt like 3 hours. That was a painful amount of talking and elaboration and explaining 😂. But love that he has some depth to him, that's for sure. Being young and all Hollywood but still knowing why he does what he does, it's refreshing.
Hes…. BRITISH
Coffee ☕ ice cream🍦taking pics of flowers 💐 and a movie 🎞 I love doing all those things. Do them with me please 😭
if im being honest nate and jacob make euphoria. without a great villain every story falls flat.
Everyone is gonna b going 2 that theater now lmaooo

I don't know but everything that left his mouth was incredibly attractive, just ✨him✨

This guy seems super cool
Good soup😭😭😭

HE HAS AN ACCENT 😳😲
He's so dreamy
"happy camper" "cup o joe" yeahhh 🇦🇺
The most important question is can I get him pregnant??
I need that man to make me a cup of coffee every morning.
Seems like such a sweet guy!
he’s so sweet
I feel like he has a very subtle Australian accent like you can hear it but can’t hear it lol
Jacob si lees esto te amo
in love with this man
Not the audition tape smack in the middle LOL
I love that he is already so successful yet he keeps following his dreams and goals. He’s on the path taking the journey, not yet at the destination.
i hope jacob doesnt get harassed because of nate's character being an a$$. actors portraying bad people are brave :)
"ITS GOOD SOUP" wow I love him
Remember God loves you!!!♥️ John 3:16  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. If you trust in Jesus Christ and repent, you will be saved.🙏 He is coming back soon......
Amazing, I absolutely HATE Nate Jacobs’s but I LOOOOVE Jacob Elordi. He’s such a great actor!
He’s so MMMFMFMFMFMMMM
this man is so fine for literally no reason oh my god. THANK YOU VOGUE
Jacob and his Australian  accent  s o cute he's so fine yummy 😋 💕💯👑🥵🥵🧡💖😊an his puppy  is adorable 😍 💖 💕 n love ❤️
This has to be one of the best 24 hour Vogue videos.
Why is his voice so different?!?!
He seems like he's a really nice guy... he's also looks like really humble person,well yeah being actor does come with Perks but he's more focused on being best actor he can be
Hope he saw The Worst Person in The World that day… it was on the posters of the theater and was the best 2021 movie in my opinion!
omg i didn't know he was britishhhh
Ngl the whole of Euphoria's cast it down to the earth - what an amazing group tho
good soup
Finally
Shoutout to whoever thought about the film noir clip, sooooo refreshing and interesting !!
I want to see him in the movie with KJ Apa. Instant love.
My favorite Jacob Elordi film is 2 Hearts. I watched that on Netflix and it was amazing. 💯
I'm need a life time with him not 24 hours
The way he ran at the end was very Nate-like. Love it!
I feel like him and Emma Chamberlain would be a POWER couple
Who else just clicked for the dog? 🐶🐾
OMG IM OBSESSED FOR THIS MAN I CAN’T LIVE WITHOUT HIM (just kidding) Or not
sen neden bu kadar tatlı ve yakışıklı giyiniyosunn
only 24 hours? I'd prefer to spend a whole lifetime with him 💀
Coooolll!
Such a beautiful soul
the end lmao i love it
he is so well-spoken!
good soup
Please, PLEASE, SOMEONE tell me the name and artist of the song at 3:33
His foot looks so tiny in the pool
GOOD SOUP
Why does his rooftop remind be of “once upon a time in Hollywood” house
I've never seen any of Jacobs other acting jobs so I still get so scared everytime I see him anywhere. Nate literally traumatized me
And this children is what you become when parents are SUPPORTIVE, I had to get pulled out of acting school for a sibling and money and I’m still upset about it to this day and I’m 34 now 🥺
He looks so cute and calm here. I never thought that he could be that kind of person.
LOVE HIM
His accent is american australian and british at the same time
HİS ACCENT OMG SO HOT
I want him to be my husband so bad 😫😫😫
JACOB EL GORDIII
everyone's forgetting he was on kissing booth and you know what, let's keep it that way.
Hello friends  Biri şunu türkçeye çevirsin rica ediyorum:)
i about melted when he was taking pictures of the flowers

I love him
LOL GOOD SOUP
3:47 HE SAID ADAM DRIVER’s ICONIC LINE “GOOD SOUP.”
he’s so handsome 😩
I need a entire life with him
Jacob Elordi seems like he would give bear hugs, and hold your head close when you feel sad. <3 I need a hug like this RIGHT NOW (please...)
He’s such a gentleman. A very old soul and I love that. I love his appreciation for true film 🥰
daddy nate😘
Aussie’s represent🤘
I’m in love with this man
sorry but he’s gorgeous
3:47 never thought id see jacob referencing a tiktok sound
Him running like that at the end😭
Omg I had NO clue that he’s Australian! He’s an amazing actor
How is this 24 hours? You got there in the day time and left him at 6pm? lol
Omg oops I’m in love with him
Sooo dreamy🥰
what a not a nate
3:04 I knew Nate and Eren had some similarities
24 hours with Angus Cloud please 🥺🥺🥺
actually in love with him omg
i could spend a lifetime with this man tbh
His accent is such a strange hybrid of Australian and LA. Warms my heart when the strong Aussie accent pokes through in certain words and phrases. Always love seeing a fellow 🇦🇺 make it big.
hes adorable
I hope he gets his dream of making a 'real movie' soon.
Pls not him opening the video with him talking about the fight scene
LOL I LOVE HOW HE SAYS GOOD SOUP TO THE MUG
i love when he said “good soup”
2:22 imma teenager, i have teenager friends, i know lots of teenager. We dont do that kind of stuff.
HES AUSTRALIAN OMG I DIDNT KNOW
Jacob when I see your last name I am proud to be Basque 🥰🥰🥰
He played nate so good that i actually hate jacob elordi
Iconic
This guy is so wholesome
Uggghhhh he’s so fine 😍😍😍

Hello Nate

omg i wasn’t prepared for him to have an accent
its not really 24 hours if he's wearing the same outfit the whole video. Maybe change it to "15 Minutes With.."
lindo amor
"good soup" yas tiktok king
His voice is just beautiful 🥺🥰
Sideview of him looks Josh Hutcherson
Jacob is such a good actor that I was genuinely surprised with how nice he is 🤣
i forget he’s aus
He’s such a talented actor, I hope he is able to get to be on the big screen soon!
GOOD SOUP
not him being so good at playing a villain that I actually think he's a villain irl
Maybe it's because i was raised in Italy but i just don't find hot most italian guys like Jacob
PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT CAMERA THEY USED
Omg!!!
no i'm cackling at the fact that he said, "good soup."
He is legit a dreaammm
anyone else not know he had an accent🤣
Vogue giving us reasons to let go of our nate phobia💀
I love him sm
funfact jacob eldori went to the school down the road of mine!
"good soup"
I love that cinema in LA! He's a great actor!
The same movie that inspired Timothee chalamet to become an actor is the same one that inspired jacob (the dark night) …. Nice:)
" Good Soup"! the camera crew was prob like " WTF was that"! While us watching are like LMAO
Such an old precious soul
This feels so Australia haha love it he is such a great actor 👍😎🥰
his euphoria character personality and real personality is so different i love it
Cute guy
my husband
After watching euphoria, I can say for sure that Jacob's talent was wasted on the kissing booth
I've never clicked so fast ♥♥. What a guy! What an actor!
this mans is british wut?
He is so fine😘😘😘
GOOD SOUP
Man he needs the good publicity😭
i’m in love w him
Well this gonna blow up
He seems to be such a sweet person
7:41 made my heart explode
@MermaidMotel plss do your magic 🤍✨🧚 I think he fits perfectly for Blue Jeans:  “Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn It was like, James Dean, for sure You're so fresh to death and sick as c-cancer”- LDR  btw fun fact his zodiac is Cancer
I had a different understanding of what the number 24 means when it comes to hours, you know, but sure
Wow he’s actually so intelligent it’s amazing
Good soup 🍲
Why aren’t we talking about how hot he is?
there’s no reason why nate should be choking and abusing maddy all bc he found his dads tapes at a young age. i have no empathy. but jacob is bae
Jacob, the perfect guy on Tinder with dog pictures and a million matches.
God hes so hansome his hands, arms 😍.He's such a cancer aswell....
If I was that girl at the ice cream place i would've instantly fell in luv
he got me at "good soup"! hahaha so charismatic
I find him so Boring, he is nice, but bland.
Nate on euphoria: 😤😡🔫🔪👊 Nate irl: 🥰🧚🏻‍♂️🥺✨💞
good soup👌
Good soup
He did a fantastic job in Euphoria. Such an intense acting in S2. Hats off!
Really down to earth, nice, humble guy. I see him a lot on fan selfies.
Aw man I love Jacob, such an amazing actor... Also I love film noir
Thank you for this.
His dog is literally adorable
Love this man so much
good soup
I always thought the Boston accent and Aussie accent had certain little similarities with the way come words are said.
I’ve never liked a video so fast
he’s beautiful woah
wish this vid was 24hours long
At this point, I wouldn’t even be surprised if Jacob is just being his own cinnamon roll self and then Nate just randomly popped onto this video and introduced himself as his evil twin brother 💀💀💀💀  If this guy was to ever be put in a role similar to Jekyll and Hyde, I bet it’d be such a hit.
i cant wait to see Jacob in a real movie like in a big screen movie. he is a brilliant actor and i hope he’ll get great roles in the future.
this man is so talented
This really gives insight into his mind. It's amazing
The name on his guitar is my name, definitely meant to be
😍
💕
Your personality 😍✨
James.dean a icon
Who does not like james dean
i think Jacob is a very sweet person. I don't know why but he just give me the vibes
I 1st saw him on the Kissing Booth and it was an all right movie, not my style and he seemd like an ok actor but upon seeing him in Euphoria, he just blew me away and I find myself uncounciously triggered by his character its just Shows the hidden talents of a great actor! I hope he expands his acting with different roles that exploit his talent.
I wanna see a movie with him
Pack me like that espresso
“Good soup” omg he’s just like us Tik Tok king
he’s so cute
i love this man
I like an actor who is actually into film.
I really wanted to hate him , but now I love him .
the mix of his australian accent and american makes him sound a little british when he says certain things
his aussie accent keeps going in and out which is sorta sad😭 he is so pretty and i love his personality
so inspiring
GOOD SOUP🤌

“Ahhh it’s good soup 👌🏻” lmao
The bomber jacket?!
He's Australian??

….
i saw a sneak peak of his toes
Y'all don't have to introduce him as a Euphoria's Jacob. We already know him
its so surreal hearing him mention coffs harbour lmao. i went there every new years for family reunions all through my childhood.
Buffalo 66?! I love him
hes such a good actor that i cant think of him as jacob, i think of him as nate and its weird seeing him act like a sane human being😭
he’s wonderful as an actor. hoping he has a long career because i don’t think he’s even close to reaching his full potential.
3:48 good soup
i would give one of my finger for one night with this man and my whole fingers for a lifetime
Hate Nate but Jacob is such a sweetheart!
I’m in love

NOT JACOB SAYING GOOD SOUP LMAO I DIED
my homework can wait
does anyone know the name of the background song that starts at  3:23
good soup

him saying "good soup" is giving me life istg
He seems kinda shy. Very cute.
He's so cool and down to earth. I wish him a great career as an actor, he deserve it!
He’s so charming and sweet! I wish this was longer 🥰
He is literally the best, most down to earth and beautiful person ever
He’s so awkwardly adorable
I would absolutely watch a film noir he was in. He has the perfect face for it
I love him, he’s such a little bean. Nothing like Nate😂😂
Oh my gosh! His accent🤍🤍🤍🤍
Oh no 24 hours with Nate. Y’all better prepare
GOOD SOUP
Good soup
He's the sweetest guy and phenomenal actor. I'm sure we will see him make it on the big screen! I know I'd pay to see anything he is in.
They way he was talking to the ice cream girl had me dead he’s so alluring without even trying
His dog is so cute 💞
Y’all are so thirsty in the comments bye 😭😭
put your feet away!!!!! god
lmao "good soup"
He's so handsome 🥰 You can tell his Aussie accent is fading a bit...when he talks you can hear it and in some scenes you don't...but I love his voice and personality
🔥
g o o d  s o u p
Jacob Elordi and Timothee Chalamet need to play enemies to lovers in a Wes Anderson film noir
U a good actor bro 👌
This is a very interesting way to approach the actor's life. Sad that the girls just got to do glam on screen.
who lives there to Him living in it!!!
I hope he gets more projects where he can showcase his depth as an actor like in Euphoria rather than being categorised as the hot shot.
✨Good soup✨ while sipping coffee  absolutely my type
Wait, he has an accent?! 🤯
He’s so perfect!! So humble & real. His portrayal of Nate Jacobs was literally so good in Euphoria. I would love to see him in more movies & series. You’re an incredible actor Jacob!👏🏻
Rare sighting of MALE beauty  ladies ans gentleman 👏👏
He seems like such a calm and kind person compared to his euphoria role. I wanna marry this man 🤣❤️
Love it
He is so calm!
He is so ADORABLE. It's such a shock seeing him being so sweet and humble and NOT chaotic after watching all that went down in Euphoria....
He'd be very very very good in a Quentin Tarantino movie.
Kinda love, that his natural accent is Australian so he doesn't sound like Nate, when he's talking😭
You're a great actor
Good soup 👌🏻
I love you
Anyone hope he would play in a Regency or historical movies ,he would be a perfect prince!
I love him omg
What a handsome man 🥺😩
He’s too adorable
He's adorable! His character Nate is crazy. He has a good range, he'll get bigger soon.
idk but I see him playing Batman
This is more like a house tour than 24 hours and no I’m not complaining about that

My love
If I ever bump in to him - I will melt like coconutoil on a hot pan….
He can have all my babies
Good soup
He is such a good actor that i actually have to remind myself not to hate him
He kinda looks intimidating cause of his big physique and also he portrays Nate so well but in real life he seems kinda shy and cool.
Ice cream girl new the assignment
He's actually so sweet omg
He is everything I want in a man fr
Jacob : takes pics of flowers   Me : dies
Euphorier
After the film noir scene, I need Jacob in one immediately! Pls!!🙏

this is me asking for his hand in marriage
So cheesy this guy was in like one movie.
good soup!
He it's so beautiful, but this video: nothing interesting 👎
Aussie Aussie Aussie oi oi oi! I never knew he was Australian 😲
protect this man!
He’ll be an A-list film actor soon. He’s proven that he can play a wide range of roles authentically. He’s extremely convincing and complex. One of the strongest of his generation. I’m excited to watch his career grow.
He just is the dream man
❤
gosh I am in love with this man
Sydney Sweeney and Jacob both are amazing actors. Ik they are still young,  yet they deserve amazing roles
I really really appreciate how tall he is 😭♥️ them genes done him great ✨

He is a really great actor. He talk a lot but in a good way 😂 You can see how passionate he is. Can’t wait to see more of him as a actor.
i am in love with jacob elordi

I like that Jacob like a childish personality  the little does in the end is so me crossing the street 💀😭
He just thinks he’s soooo special.  🙄
more like 10 hours
I don't care what u think. HE IS SO FINEE
Brillant actor and coolest guy <3
hecho por los dioses
I don't think I can watch this full. I fell in love with this dude😭

Where are the 24 hours?
Now I see why Maddy and Cassie fell in love.
He has great style and it’s cute that he took pictures of flowers
"good soup"  lmao I love him
You can see at the very end in the theater the film "The Worst Person in the World" is showing, this is a nod to Jacob's Euphoria character Nate being literally the Worst Person in the World
i can't with him he's just too much for me little heart
Ok but the aesthetic of this video mann 🤌🏻💯
Honestly? Dude would make a perfect Cyclops for MCU X-Men. Looks the part and has the chops
The Adam Driver reference at 3:48 really did it for me
such a warm video... i would sit and talk to him for hours
He's such a dreamboat 💕😍
Love how down to earth he seems and how much he prides himself as being an actor and having such a keen interest in the old school noir films and old classic Hollywood style. <3
i want to be jacob’s dog
Can’t get over that shot in season 2 episode 7 where Jacob absolutely towers over Eric Dane. Never thought anyone could make Eric look small but that shot absolutely conveyed the feeling of that scene. Stellar cast and Jacob is a powerhouse.
guys they robbed us with clickbait its only 4 measly hours with jacob elordi
I wanted Portuguese subtitles 😩🇧🇷
Love seeing people passionate about their craft ❤
His accent~ Chefs kiss ❤
look at him he is so cuteeeee
Pls his accent
Cute puppies playing in the park for the first time https://youtu.be/gfqaqn9dQZ4
Come on Hollywood why denied his charming on the big screen for greatest budget movie? We need someone like him for our entertainment.
Aww I want him to be Batman tbh
POV You never knew he was British until seeing this
Jacob: You know Cameraman: ¿-?
3:46 "it's good soup" 🥴
He has the potential to win so many awards. He’s very laid back and charismatic. He’s just so like-able. Then you mix that with his INSANE acting talent and it’s just like 🤯
During the film noir scene, he kinda looked like a young Marlon Brando.
🤓😊🤓
I love his style 👍
I would like him to destroy me in all ways possible.
He is actually seems pretty nice and chill. He is too much Nate for me (and who likes Nate?), but here, so calm and seemed like a nice guy☺️
He’s actually such a genuine guy irl it’s crazy how amazing of an actor he is
BAHAHA the film noir part is great! “LONG GONE”
He is such an amazing actor. I wish I could spend a day with him, he’s so chill and creative
He lit looks like a Greek statue. So stunning
Hey Jacob, I will star in your film noir. Just cast me, thanks.
Not him saying "good soup" when tasting the coffee 😭😭
…he’s australian?
good soup💀💀 3:48
I want a poster of the entire cast of euphoria on my bedroom wall
I hate him he threaten Maddy Demie with rebolber
Ok you got me, the man's got charm!
He is just 'Euphoria's'. Like God he is Jacob Elordi he has other stuff outside this TV show.
I love u Jacob.. ❤️😭 what should I do?!?
“It’s good soup” 😂☕️
I actually love him.
I know he was acting, but after watching euphoria everytime I see this guy I'm f*cking scared

quiero su vida
He's a great actor because in real life he seems like  a sweetheart
HE'S SO CUTE UGHHH <3333!
He gives Brando energy
me da miedo
I just realized his voice is actually deeper in real life. like when he talks normally in daily
He's like a philosopher
if he made a film noir, I would watch it
i’m so in love
The good soup moment 💀💀 what a charming human being!!
God what a wise and lovely person he his!

Good soup
He seems very humble and genuine!
I want to smell him 👀👀
I refuse to believe this is the same man who played nate Jacobs
I be forgetting this man has an ACCENT… and then he speaks and just 🤤🤤🤤🤤
“ahh thats good soup”
I would kill to watch him in a old black and white film like that
Cassie wishes to be the dog - 🧍🏻‍♀️🧎🏻‍♀️🐕
i could watch this forever 3:33 - 3:50 😍
I know his character is toxic but I had a dream of him few weeks back and man there's no going back now😭 am head over heels for him  Ps : i have this habit of falling in love or whatever when I dream of any guy 😂
The fact that he could be this generations ‘James Dean’ is crazy full circle for him. He’s a great actor!
better after the lil h*ddy one
THANK U VOGUE
What I wouldn’t do to look even 1/10th as beautiful as he is.
I love him so much

Love him!😊
Why are people of my age always way more mature than me😅
he's so boring
His performance as Nate Jacobs in Euphoria is astoundingly complex, volatile and so so human. Very excited to see what he does next.
he is so a good actor bc the way i wanted to beat nate and kiss noah its so wierd
Good soup
3:47  - the Adam Driver reference has me dead
i love him
See, the thing is he seems good actor, loves cinema and isn't there just for the fame, but this video irks me. It's the way they showed cliché version of male lead. No stop doing that, stop, it's looks so staged and just fake. He's lovely but do better Vogue!!!
Who decorated this apartment because I know it wasn't this 24 year old.
"good soup" plss lmaoo I love him sm
good soup
literally a dreamy guy, the style, the thoughtfulness and empathy, love of art and film noir... god hes perfect

Lol good soup
What movie did he watch though?
how did the cameraman not fall in love with him in the middle of this
i love his energy like he seems so chill and down to earth
He should play a vampire

Cutest sweetest human ever. The actual love of my life
He is so fine
He is such an infp
Everything including him is so vintage-y !

in real life he's a golden retriever
My crush.
he seems like such a nice guy, but ngl i just cannot take that idea of what nate jacobs is out of him, when he's literally a different soul. everytime i see him i just get intimidated, but he does his job way too good
I’m in love with him I swear
Is he british?!?
“Good soup” lmao
I literally started watching Euphoria yesterday and this pops up on my recommendations today, talk about timing! 🤭❤

He's Australian?
Los Feliz movie theatre is about to get flocked 🙃 great
It really baffles me how well he played Nate Jacobs because not only do I absolutely RESENT him, I’m also quite terrified of him😭I absolutely love him
He’s an incredible actor I wish him the best
It's the voice, his clean style and the way he express himself. He's UNHEALTHY hot.
When he said “good soup” after he drank his coffee 💀
NOT HIM DOING GOOD SOUP
Omgg sooooo attractive, suchhhh a good actor and that accent 🥵🥰😍🤩. I really hope to see him expand his acting career
72 questions with him next!

This is my favorite 24 hour video... Thank you, Vogue.
He is sooooooo handsome 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍

Admit it guys.....we were all waiting to see his handsome and charming self anywhere for as long as we could ❤️
omg he has a accent! i didn’t know that! lol
the vibe this man has going on is immaculate
I remember seeing him on kissing booth never thinking he'll have made such a huge impact in a serious show. Very talented actor.
He walks past beautiful flowers and he takes a picture. He is one of a kind so cute😭
protect this man
You know???
I hope since this is only the beginning of his career that he really does get to fulfill his dreams of starring in a cinematic gem - just like him. Give the people what they (& jacob) want ☺️
Him going ‘good soup 👌🏻’
i wish I was that dog
I hope his dreams come true, he truly deserves it ^-^
When u realize he is the exact opposite of who he plays on Euphoria is when u realize he is an incredible actor.
Gntg bgt
cant believe this golden retriever of a guy plays a psychopath lmao
Imma say it - he is the reincarnation of james dean
He seems like such a nice guy
I LOVE HIM
I LOVE how he dresses
I… want to be his friend.
He should be a great batman
OH MY GOD I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS, DEFINITELY WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT LOL
Hear such a good actor 💕
His accent sounds so American at times. I guess that’s why it’s unnoticeable when he’s playing as Nate
He could spit on me and I would say thank you 😩😩
The way he understood the character of Nate in depth and acted his part so so so well, it's just incredible. Also, why's he so cute. 🥲❤️
He is sooo tall, I bet he is like 6f5 maybe 7f…
How could a man be so aesthetically pleasing? Aaaah my eyes!
How many times can I like a video????
He's an amazing actor and seems like such a sweetheart!
he's so cool.
oh God, he is so sweet, I can’t 😮‍💨😮‍💨😍
what an adorable person. i’m actually really taken back almost bc of it
Aaaaaa😍
He seems so sweet, I could listen to him talking about movies for hours. :)
he’s a dream ❤️😍
he truly loves what he does and it’s so inspiring
i love how he is an old soul and also the sweetest
JAJAJAJ GOOD SOUP I CANT
Great actor
THE WAY HE RAN ACROSS THE STREET 😭😭😭💜
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰just fantastic! Jacob is immensely talented and I see him being far bigger than James Dean one day.
That's ok, but how insecure do you feel now?¿ -To whoever filmed this with him
Aw goldens r the best!
Logan Paul but much better 😂
Its so strange watching him here he’s very attractive to me - a sentiment I didn’t have not for a second watching euphoria
I can't hate him because he looks exactly like my little brother Gabriel. And then i have another brother Who looks exactly like Bo Burnham.
handsome aff
This is the ‘Nate’ we all love
I am respectfully in love with this man
jacob having an earring..... nate could never
The fact that so many people hate the character "Nate" just proves how good of an actor Jacob really is, I love this guy !! ❤️💞
vogue is crazy for making that little film in the middle of this video. SO GOOD.
You are telling me this guy has been working for 7 years now being 24 yo and he is so successful already?  Damm Jacob you are living the dream.
i forget he’s not always nate jacobs

Good Soup
no pensé que era una persona a la que le podían llegar a gustar ese tipo de películas bien ahi
Wow love him
he deserves to be in an oscar-worthy film with a theatrical release
lover boy
Sad, but I didn’t realize he was a good actor until Euphoria bc of the roles he was casted in. Seems like a great person and actor ✨
he is so good actor and seems such a genuine person love him
😩♥️
I HATE NATE JACOBS I LOVE JACOB ELORDI
Good soup!
He is kinda sweet
He's a cancerian y'all 😳😳😳😳
“Good Soup!” LOL I was not expecting that
this looks like that pool scene in Euphoria with him, his dad and Cassie lol
I love him.
He is such a cutie and good Autor and his aura speak for himself.
Me explican por qué este video no dura 24 hrs. No tiene sentidoooooo
Noah Flynn is back 💖
All I can say is what a man
EARLYYY
He's so sweet and clear 💐
I love this man
his voice is so calming
He is truly such a sweet person.
is that kaia gerbers dog????
this video really shows he’s got amazing taste
24h? That was barley 6 hours
Jacob breakup with the college scam girl Olivia and start dating Sidney RIGHT NOW!
The content we live for!
He`s such a good actor and he has such an amazing vibe and hes so charismatic, I love him!!! Perfeitoo<33333
oh my gosh!!! he is so handsome and soft 🥺
Your handsomeness amazes me dear, Jacob
THAT DOG IS SO CUTE OMG
good soup
GOD BLESS  this man <3 he is such a Cancer sign and I love it!
Hope to see him in even bigger acting roles in the near future 🙌🏽
NATE SHOULD D WORD AND U KNOW IT TOO
He’s such a good actor! I would love to see him in lead roles, am I the only one who thinks he would play a good Batman?😭
He’s really a amazing actor I’d love to see him in future movies/shows his acting is so believable I definitely could see him blowing up to be a major actor in the future
It’s love I tell u, I do love this man
AAAAA I'M ACTUALLY SCREAMING
HE'S AUSTRALIAN!?!?!??!?!
He isnt looking at the camera tho which is a a bit awkward
it’s kind of funny how every other actor on euphoria feels like they’re playing themselves, meanwhile jacob seems the polar opposite of his character
When are we seeing JE on the big screen? He has such an old Hollywood leading man persona/charisma. Hollywood - listen up!
here come the editors on tiktok
how could anyone hate this soft soul
It was so cute when he was taking photos of the flowers AWWWW
i want him 😭
I don't know how people associate Nate with Jacob irl. If you watched him as Noah Flynn first then it's easy. He seems super down to earth and sweet.
He should be in a Wes Anderson movie.  He's so aesthetic
cassie, we get it
Do this with Dominic fike!!✨
I NEVER GET MORE THAN 1 LIKE :(
Gosh, he is so handsome. He’s talented and seems kind too. I can’t wait to see him succeed!
WAIT HES NOT AMERICAN???? I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I HEARD HIS REAL ACCENT. and it’s so hard to not picture him as Nate n the personality n all, he’s literally so sweet n interesting. such a good actor
We need 24 hours with Hailee Steinfeld
Ngl he's a good actor
LOVE HIM 😌
that cup was 100% empty lol
He is just a big kid, aw
He is so good at acting it always amazes me how young he is! Literally one of the most promising actors out here😫✋ and he seems sm fun tbhh
El es espectacular actuando! Y muy hermoso....😍
hes so cute omg n soft too🥺🥺🥺
He seems down to earth & humbling
I was lowkey kinda expecting to see one about Jacob!...and here we are Nathaniel!!! XD
Cool man 😎
so nice to see how down to earth he is and also like can we talk about how passionated he is when it comes to movies and filming and theaters i just love it. Hope to see him in some big blockbuster roles xx
Waiting for Jacob to star in the next taylor swift music video
If he needs another dog, I can bark😍😩
He barely has aussie accent huh
What a man! Lovely
he’s such an angel oh my god
he's so handsome, i'm melting
hes so cute omg
This ain’t 24 hours…
my bae
3:47 good soup 💀
6'5 tall guy taking a picture of flowers 🌸
Love him!!
I am so in love with him. His whole self is so charming.
I want to saw him more in goodboy way acting like more kissing booth role 🥲 I always curse when i saw her face euphoria feels 😩 but u know i love him!!! ✨🤍
He is such a sweetheart !! 💖
😍
OMG HES AUSTRALIAN
Love him!!!!!
He’s the best actor for Nate
lol
his voice is so calming
him imitating adam driver when he said "good soup"...like no that made me blush
He’s soo charming
I love his dog!🥺🥺❤️
he has literally nothing to do with nate
Oh man he should play a biopic of Marlon Brando when he was younger!
Omg his American accent is sooo good!!
I uses to think he's just a dumbo handsome hunk but no he's so adorablly humble and intellectual
He’s so fine
Nate count yo days
HE would be a goot BATMAN
He's so cute...
His dog is the luckiest doggy in the WORLD.
J A C O B ✨
this man is not only handsome but extremely talented. is a great actor!
The film noir part: u can’t not fall in love
This man was written by a woman 🤗
he’s such a vibe.
Brooo that video just made my day
love him so muchhh
es muy lindoooo😍😍😍😍
Ok, NOW JACOB TELL US WHY WE HAVE TO WAIT 2 YEARS FOR THE NEXT SEASON 😀🙂🥲
God I love him
the way he zoned out at 07:03 🤣
I don't like watching actors in real life because it makes me fall in love them even more
NEVER CLICKED A VIDEO FAST BEFORE
he seem so simple
HE HAS AN ACCENT
He seems genuinely humble and a sweet guy.
His hero is heath ledger. Of course he’s an amazing actor
it's sad that some people hate on him because of his character. shows how good of an actor he is
He really couldn't be more different than Nate
honestly can’t decide wether i want to be him or be with him 😃🔫
I've never been this early
Dudes a douche in real life too.
🥵😍😍😍
Jacob>>>Nate
WHY IS EVERYONE inspired off the dark knight. Timmy, Jacob idk a couple others. I think I saw heath ledger in patriot and hard candy and I said THAT'S what I wanna do
GOOD SOUP AHHAHAAHAHHAHAA
he even said *good soup* XD
the big difference between his character as nate and him off cam proves how great of an actor he is. he’s such a sweet man in this video. looking forward to the season 3 of euphoria ☺️
Him little noir film at the end >>>>
Love him
“good soup”  😭❤️
THAT was very good. Wow. Never seen that in a 24hr Vogue video before
Obsessed with his sense of fashion!!
telling he is that close to the Hollywood sign we know where is house is now
He's nice to watch but this is not even 24 hours with him. "A moment with Jacob Elordi" seems a better title.
jacob elordi >>> nate jacobs
you can really tell how much he loves his job. i really wish the very best for him :)
the way he did the good soup kfdsgjdksjsl
I love you Jacob 🤍
💗
He looks freakin cool and handsome in tux 😍
I’m in love with him 😍
nate jacobs sucks but jacob the actor is cool 🥺
Tell nate Jacobs and Jacob elordi they are beautiful
He seems so sweet and man he is so talented! Because Nate is so scary😆
yes
The social climber finally made it on Vogue I bet he's ecstatic
He seems very grounded! 💯
<3
This man is simply beautiful. Nobody deserves him
Hate u nate
this kid is going to be a moviestar.
No estaba en casa, pero que bueno que los atendió bien.
He's such an 'it' boy!
He's so poised and articulate!
he has such a chill vibe
Wait he's actually sweet irl
Op
Ahhh he so so amazing and he is an amazing actor
He managed to make his character the most obnoxious of the whole series, you do a great job Jacob Elordi <3
😍😍😍
To the dumbnutz hating him still, please try to seperate the character and the person themselves. They are called actors for a reason.
i find it so cute how he’ll start talking about some he’s passionate about and his whole face lights up… it’s the cutest thing
After his heartfelt monologue about life and trying to be more understanding of others his "good soup" comment really threw me off XDD  And the way he talks about movies, and art overall he just seems like a great guy
Jacob seems quite down to earth and he really does seem like he has a passion for acting. I hope he keeps getting more amazing roles after euphoria
woah this is the earliest I've been
this australian man… ugggh 😩
He is actually pretty sweet
He made the „good soup“ joke I love him
He’s so cute..unreal
Check this out: https://youtu.be/-bggGoZvl9U
My love for Jacob makes it so hard for me to hate on Nate 😂😂 Jacob is seriously such a genuine and sweet person
I think he’s the most gorgeous man on the planet
“It’s good soup” 💀💀
YES YES YESSSSSSS.
Phew...he is so hot and for what 😫😫😫
I would like to see Cassie and Maddie destroy Nate next season 😍
my husband hi
The way Jacob loves his dog, If he wants another pet just let me know lmao
❤️❤️❤️
Jacob was crafted in heaven. His height, body, eyes, eyebrows, lashes, nose, hair and everything about him!!  He's a literal Greek god 😭❤️🥵
He may be tall, but has a baby face.
hes so sweet omg
yes I do the cooking yes I do the cleaning
LMAOO THE "wth was that" 😭😭
he's sooo sweet irl that's what i love about him.
this feels like he's giving me a tour of his place the morning after we hooked up
Jacob é um ótimo ator. Parece ser tão doce e educado❤
Jacob is the man of my dreams. I mean just look at him 😭❤️
Jacob is the total opposite of his character on Euphoria, he's such a precious guy
Love to hate him....
forgot he’s actually sweet in real life lol 😭
He was insecure about his height but can we appreciate that height !   It's jst everything! ❤️
He's honestly so charismatic, I love him.
this man is so dreamy
24 hours with jacob isn't enough i need a lifetime with this man
He seems really sweet.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
nate jacobs and jacob elordi are so oppisite
Oh he seems so cool
Honestly, he is so complex as Nate and that speaks to his great acting
i hate that he played his character in euphoria so well because im terrified of him LOL  he's actually such a sweetheart
HE DID THE GOOD SOUP MEME LMFAOO

Jacob is so fine
