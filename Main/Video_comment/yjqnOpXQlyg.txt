0:07 😮
Anyone else got reminded of this song watching JaidenAnimations?
You know what's the worst part about this song?? Is that in 2:12, it only lasts 20 seconds!! 😢❤
I can tell u are differently not from  Cali baby
Happy 23rd Nessa Barrett! 🎉🥳🎂🍰
This video gave me chills.How unexpected....🌊always perfect.🌱🌼
We need a collab of Nessa and Lana Del Rey!!! ❤✋️
Top ten♌
This song is so deep.
Bosan dengan California... 👍😁♥️
❤
That’s jenna ortega
Been here since ‘if you love me’ by nessa❤️‍🩹
Well now much of California is burnt up 🔥
Damn I want that Merc 😍
Bet you are, everything in LA is burning
Mulholland drive
🚙😬😮🏃‍♀️☠️🌄⛪️🧖🚶‍♀️🚙...
fave
One of the best songs ever
Who’s listening to this after LA Wildfires. This song did not age well did it 💀 🤣
Burning down your California mansion? Yeah, about that…  Rain sure would be convenient right about now.
Why is she so underrated!!!!!!
2025 ?
Beautiful talented Old soul
the old benz is an abolute cherry on top! love ur tracks no matter how new or old

ATATA. Beer. HUSIKC LA. LBS ❤❤❤
ATATA. Beer. HUSIKC LA. LBS ❤❤❤
Nessa is such an underated artist
November 2024?🖤
It’s October 2024 - Anyone else looking through Nessa’s older videos and behind the scenes? 🖤🩷🖤
She's slowly turning into one of my new fave artist🙃........
До сих пор люблю эту песню 🌹🤍
didn't even know this was a tiktoker until now. I just liked her first EP on deezer back in 2021, found it again and came on in to check out what she's been up to. I'm normally into skatepunk and the likes-  Opening her debut album with a straight-up banger, I see. let's see where this may lead, seems like a concept album on first sight. I'm impressed.
Love love love you Nessa
Apple Music?
Why does this speak to me
🥰🥰🥰🔥🔥🔥
They sampled Tom’s Diner and somehow it still sounds good
❤ Hare Krišna 🍀🔥🔥💯
The video literally has zero connection to the music. Just a bunch of random scenes that convey exactly the opposite of the lyrics.  She reminds me of Florence Welch in her early years. A few good songs but zero stage presence, except perhaps in the eyes of teenage girls. When you listen to her songs by the fifth song they all sound the same.
Jesse I love you
La la la WAIT I was there so like what
la da die ..❤❤
I really like the ending with her older self being so caring for her. Its creepy though.
Oh... It's great song😅
tom's diner?
Grbururjuuidiufjufhf
Uguurrriehrirurlir uh
amazing
This is basically Suzanne Vega's song just with words replacing the non-lyrical melody: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n-Ktg3XyPU
she reminds me of jeff bezos
Girl me too
Does anyone else hear the similarity between this and knee sox by Arctic Monkeys?
I'm so tired of California, I'm so tired of LA) (Where the real thing comes as often as the California rain)  I get sick of sunshine on my perfect skin Vapid conversation giving me the spins Driving down Mulholland, closing both my eyes 'Cause they say you get more famous when you die  And everyone seems fine Am I losing my mind?  I'm so tired of California, I'm so tired of LA Where the real thing comes as often as the California rain I got all these legal toxins in my blood and in my brain I keep saying that I'm leaving, but it doesn't work that way  I can't feel my hеartbeat way up in the Hills Burning down my mansion, didn't write a will Front row at my funеral, crocodile tears Came here for the weekend, but I haven't left in years (Is that weird?)  I'm so tired of California, I'm so tired of LA Where the real thing comes as often as the California rain I got all these legal toxins in my blood and in my brain I keep saying that I'm leaving, but it doesn't work that way  Can I be young forever? Would it be fun forever? Can I be young forever? Would it be fun forever?  (We're so tired of California, we're so tired of LA) (Where the real thing comes as often as the California rain) (We got all these legal toxins in our blood and in our brain) (We keep saying that we're leaving, but it doesn't work that way)  I'm so tired of California, I'm so tired of LA Where the real thing comes as often as the California rain I got all these legal toxins in my blood and in my brain I keep saying that I'm leaving, but it doesn't work that way
At  2:10 that whole part 😭
The opposite of One Republic song dreaming about the west coast
We're all tired of the Chemtrail Butterflies of California.  (ツ) ☕☕🦋😬🦋
❤❤
Tired of Cali? Go to Siberia!
I LOVE the lyrics.
Did she write this song?
Love her music!
Nessa❤❤❤
FUCCKKKKKKINNN MAJESTICC SONG HOLY SHIT, WHERE HAVE I BEEN THIS WHOLE YEAR?!
Amo muito a nessa❤
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THIS MUSIC VIDEO ❤
اخخ يجمالها
Still not tired of this one. Kind of haunting.
Thank you Spotify for the amazing suggestion. Cant stop listening to Nessa, and have never heard of her before!
Nessa is so pretty
im sorry but this song deserves to have at least 50 or 60M views
Honestly this song sent me right back to La Di Die cuz in that song she’s dreaming of having this life and then this song is like a sequel of her getting that life that she wanted in La Di Die and and realising it’s not as glamorous as she thought when she she was younger so it’s like her old self having hopes and dreams and willing to do anything to achieve them and wondering if it’ll be worth it and her older self experiencing them and realising it’s not worth it anymore…🥺 She also has a line in La Di Die that says “Does it rain in California only dream I’ve ever known” and here she sings “Where the real thing comes as often as the California rain”😭
Wait so her old self tried to kill her? Cuz why did she panic when she was in the car with her and why did she exist the car in the middle of the desert trying to escape?
Tom's Diner
garbage music
My mind is blown way ness just wow you perfect angel this is so beautiful ❤ im so so proud of you always will be i love you forever

If You Lean Out Of A Moving Car You May Be Decapitated No Matter Where You Live ! ! !
She sounds like Billie Elish and Camila Cabello and looks like Camila, Olivia Rodrigo and Jenna Ortega.
it sounds like knee socks by arctic monkeys.
I feel like she died in California and now she's a ghost and can't ever leave 🕊
Yes
🤍🤍
anyone else hears  knee socks ?
I can see this song being in a episode of American Horror Story.
dude i can't stop listening to this...  this needs to go viral .. but i hope it won't so it'll be my little secret
Knee socks
HER BEST VIDEO THE PRETTIEST SHE'S EVER LOOKED
The song has the same tune to it as the song called Tom's Diner. I really like them Both.
so obsessed
i love u sfm nessa u have my heart
❤❤❤❤
I get sick of sunshine, on my perfect skin Vapid conversation, giving me head-spins Driving down Mulholland, closing both my eyes 'Cause they say you get more famous when you die  And everyone seems fine Am I losing my mind?  I'm so tired of California, I'm so tired of L.A Where the real thing comes as often, as the California rain I got all these legal toxins in my blood and in my brain I keep saying that I'm leaving but it doesn't work that way  (Mm-mm-mm-mm Mm-mm-mm-mm)  I can't feel my heartbeat, way up in the hills Burning down my mansion, didn't write a will Front row at my funeral, crocodile tears Came here for the weekend, but I haven't left in years (Is that weird?)

KNEE SOCKS BY ARCTIC MONKEYS WTF???????
This sounds oddly familiar lmao
Awesome song, I love it.
She’s so weird looking I’m sorry 😭 it’s her smile
Of all the albums, I like this one the most.
Literally in love with her musi rn, love nessa so much ❤️❤️

🥲 1 2 3 4 5 show bom bom 34
Hmm sounds like 90s
It gives a nostalgia feeling
this sounds like 'Tom's Diner' by Suzanne Vega
I can't believe how far she has come
I can’t believe forever young is already 4 months old 😭😭
This is so damn good
i just realised idk if it’s an accident or on purpose but its the same melody as Centuries by fallout boy
her music videos are always so amazing
Заебись 👍
Yas nessa supporting up and coming stylist Riza the label 🤍🤍
Я влюбилась в неё😳💕
THIS Deserve a Grammy wow
❤️‍🩹
🤍
Wow best music ever 🤩🤩 #youngforevz#
この曲めっちゃ好きfrom Japan.
IM BUYING TICKETS!!!
It's all clairos fault for making me love when songs have children choirs in the background  😭
This is literally a masterpiece
“I keep saying I’m leaving but it doesn’t work that way”.... that’s true. Because once you sign that big ”contract” with Hollywood [them] they own you. You no longer have a say in what you do with your personal life. I hope she can find a way out at some point. Sounds deep, because it literally is.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
i’m so incredibly proud of ness words can’t even explain
Que voz maravilhosa
1:54
cooper will be happy about you.
this sounds like knee socks by arctic monkeys
Hi, Nessa, I'm your fan from Russia, I really want to see you live.I hope I'll fly to Los Angeles and meet you. I love you.
LOVE THIS GOD!! 🖤 so proud of Ness
Goosebumps!!!
You fucking amazing Nessa 🎪💒🤍🕊❤️‍🔥🌈✨
From "does it rain in California" to "tired of California" 💅👑
at work we play the top hits and i hate A LOT of the hits, very basic. but as someone who honestly heavily critiques music, she sounds great and it’s a really unique song:) Going to check her out.
I wonder why Nessa wanted to Hitchhike in her music video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-26hsZqwveA  seriously the beat sounds like this
Who else thinks she needs a Grammy LIKE ONE OF MY FAV SONGS def in my top 3 favorites
I been standin in the kitchen Over the stove water whippin 😮
Near carbon copy of 'Centuries" by Fall Out Boy.....new pop music is trash.
Those are some poofy bloomers.
🍾🥂🍾🥂🍾🥂🍾🥂2023🍾🥂🍾🥂🍾🥂🍾🥂🍾🥂
It's kind of "Suzanne Vega - Tom's Diner"
I was literally saying that she looked like another Billie Eilish and Halsey and so glad i'm not the only one lol
Viciada nessa 🤍
She’s the new Lana
Nessa = Genius
Lame
bruh these girls would make hate songs and rant videos about toxic LA is and then continue to live there like wtf
I dont understand why this girl not the most famous person ever, she is only one in a few of singer that deserves so much more
nessa music is so good she really deserves to be known as a singer . I listened  to dixie  songs but they don't give you like chills of thinking she is gonna be a singer . Nessa is a singer i hope one day she is  a famous singer
SHE IS LITERALLY A GODDESS
SHUT UP I KEEP GETTING EMAILS 📧 😒
This deserve more likes
❤
merece Grammy ta
This beat sounds very similar to “Heathens” By “Twenty One Pilots”
Sounds like another artist just sampled, or very closely imitated  Tom's Diner by Suzanne Vega. Doja Cat's freaky deaky was the other artist I'm thinking of. Still a pretty chill jam though!
Perfeita
I’m really interested to see what she does in the future because her music now is so good and so unique. I hope she keeps it going because she has a real future in this
Хочу её в России
_Love it song_  💋🇵🇪
Как же мне нравится эта девушка, и её голос❤❤❤
😯👍👍👍👍👍😍 ol persista son unas Mujeres muy hermosas ....mientras mas miles sean mas Bonita se den
Occult aplenty with this one..  I'm not even going to say how, I'm sick of spelling it out, if you can decode this video then well done I guess.
I really thought this was camila cabello's voice
came here for the weekend but I haven’t left in years…. damn
You kids are probably too young but im fairly sure this is a modern day interpretation of 'Hotel California'  by the Eagles. Clever.
She looks beautiful
Breakfast at Tiffany's
Can't wait to hear her next single, I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor!
Have I missed something or is this just Knee Socks by Arctic Monkeys?
3M COME ON!!!!!!!!!
this mv was so beautiful omg
I miss the harder rock vibez. I hope the next album is more rock
estaba viendo un canal de música y pusieron este video, no le estaba prestando atención pero por un momento se me hizo muy parecida a knees socks de arctic monkeys así que vine a escucharla nuevamente y si, es muy parecida
her songs is everythig i need. <
💞💞
love it omg best song ever ♡
Love you 💓💓
💯 ⛔ 🆘 🆘 IDEAL PART FOR jxdn❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑👑👑👌👌👌💋💋💋💋💋🌃🌃🌃🌃
🎶 I'm so tired of Seattle, I'm so tired of the rain. Where the lives of every body is as rough as the terrain 🎶

It looks like knee socks from arctic monkeys
I am sitting in the morning vibes!!!!!
Yo y los cansados de California 💋
SHE DESERVES MORE!!!!!!

Come to the east coast baby I would die to see you in Boston or Massachusetts I would def drive to see you I'm about to drive to CT from Boston to see Nickelback my #1 band but your voice is just so amazing and your story and I feel you I lived in the same place and the same house for 30yrs with all the trauma and B's that happened here and the people that caused the traumas i have to and do live with
Remind me of Susan Vega’s song.  https://youtu.be/j4jtIDaeaWI

https://youtu.be/avQlspZeK_g

This is the best song I've ever heard in my entire life 💕💕💕💕💕💕
Me ha encantado el vídeo y muy bonita canción 👏👏👍👍😊❤💕💕
OH GOD THIS IS SO GOOODDD
I love her music <3333
I am sooo obsessed with your album!!
Escape from LA
You know why I came ?? Because the music is sk fucking similar to Tom's diner you see...even the beginning
* Very 'inspired' by Suzanne Vega's "Tom's Diner" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLP6QluMlrg)
Nessa es de las únicas tik tokers que se ha convertido en artista y ha hecho buena música
what model is the mercedes?
The only TikToker that can sing
Girl if you tired just leave
This shits fire
so tired of California, I'm so tired of LA Where the real thing comes as often as the California rain  I get sick of sunshine on my perfect skin Vapid conversation giving me head-spins Driving down Mulholland, closing both my eyes 'Cause they say you get more famous when you die  And everyone seems fine Am I losing my mind?

	No puedo decir si las cosas mejorarán si cambiamos. Lo que puedo decir es que debemos cambiar si queremos mejorar.
One of few TikTokers with listenable music, bravo 👏 I’ve listened to a couple of songs and I’m a fan.
w nessa, w song🥺🍃🍃
Holy shit I didn’t expect this to be as good as it is🥲 gonna loop this shit I love it
hm
Pretty + Good music she is so underrated
Anyone else getting Rosa from OITNB vibes???
Come back to jersey baby we love you
Is this Lorde? Or Billy eilish? Or Lana del Rey? Or Charlie xcx? I can’t tell anymore
This is a pure gem✨️❤️❤️ keep up the good work.
Nessa, hi! I listen to your songs non stop for a couple of weeks and I feel so inspired that decided to share with you. I know you may never see this and I’m doing this kinda thing as a fan-letter first time in life 😂  So! I don’t have anyyyy idea about these tiktok comments, I am a foreigner + too old for tiktok😂😂😂 and when I started to listen to your songs and try to understand those comments , I was like okaaaay so why is it so important that she “came from tiktok”? “Is better then other tiktokers” and blah blah blah. WHY people so much care, where you STARTED ?   Well guys, she started because of her dad and mom, you know? And why other thing bother you so much? 20 years Ago singers started via tv-shows, now they start from social media. THIS IS NORMAL. Let’s please make it normal!!! Let’s not freaking judge THE ACTUAL ARTIST by where he/she begun JC!   Ok it was maybe cringe but actually I don’t care  I found a BEAUTIFUL TALANTED AMAZING TRUE ARTIST   via my recs in Apple Music. And I just want to say please go on, do music (of course if you want to, if it is your real passion, not because a new fan begs you to haha).   You are so talented and I will always support you!❤  Thank you for YOU!
The lyrics remind me of hotel California
Great Song! Beach - Back In Time (Beamer Remix) - Fantastic New Single from emerging UK Solo Artist, Beach, is on Youtube now: https://youtu.be/fSDYrV0h5U4
wie immer von dir ..geil
😀
It's just another Tom's dinner ...sounds exactly like Susan Vega
MASTERPIECE
This song describes how I feel about my abusive relationship with my mom and the suburban-esque area we moved to when I was 14. No matter how much I scream I'm leaving city life and her behind and wish to go back to the countryside, it seems life just keeps throwing roadblocks my way making it seem almost impossible from time to time. Sometimes I genuinely feel like I'll die, being trapped in this constant rush of the city and the miserable situation I'm in. I loved 'Die First',  but this song cemented me as a Nessa Barret fan.
Conservatives can relate to this song A LOT lol
love it and u!
your better than charli
your voice is amazing
omg i luv her so much. she's like maggie lindemann nd olivia rodrigo in one
nessa is one of those artists whose music is both aesthetic and actually good
Nessa linda
Hi I’m Bill and welcome to Jackass
Girl, u are the only singer Who has tiktok that is actually good-
Wow this is a huge update
😍❤🔥
Trash…and whatever she did to her lips is hideous
Nessa I been telling everyone about Cali and finally someone put it in a song.
Love it💗
Can someone explain me why i cry everytime i hear this song? I swear, i never do that
The song itself and the beat suspiciouy sounds like a mix between Knee Socks, or Tom's Diner...🤨
Only person to ever make music that came from Tiktok and DO IT RIGHT
🕊🤍🤍🤍
the music tho 👌
Literal..Chills.OMFG
I’m sorry Nessa has good songs but this one is a total rip off of “Tom’s Diner”
perfect perfect!!! ness you are brilliant!!!
I just discovered her and now I have literally chills what the f
Я один в припеве слышу Suzanne Vega «Tom's Diner» ?
Clever video and an interest lyrical message. She stands out from her peers already, Nice.
Sounds like Tom’s diner 🤫
🇮🇩♥️👍😁
Perfect voice
D
MDS QUE MÚSICA PFT NESSA NUNCA ERRA!!!
2:11 this part gives me goosebumps!
I like this
Love the bridge with the kids
This is sooooooo amazing Nessa!🤍 Cooper will be crying with joy for you 🕊
Hhh
Go girl say it
https://youtu.be/Hfvn9i8SKeQ
uniqueness is the main advantage in music, your songs are proof of that!
A collab with Lil Dusty G would be mad 🙏
can we just appreciate this quality music video
pls never stop making music 😭😭😭
love the style of editing
YASS I LOVE THE ALBUM
I remember when so many people were hating on Nessa years ago for the cheating incident or whatever the hell happened. I listened to the CHD interview and SOBBED learning how much she has gone through. But she also carried herself so well and was so mature in that interview. I watched the Zach Sang show interview and cried even more. I have listened to her album three times in a row tonight and she is the ONLY TikTok star that I think has good music out now (out of people in young TikTok clique).   This girl has been through so much in her life and all she has probably ever wanted was to be seen, heard, and loved and I think she is finally starting to feel some of that.   And this music video is just incredible.
The tune is exactly like Tom’s Diner by Suzanne Vega. Isnt it?
is this really the same progression as hotel california haha & Bm... jesus..
نفس اغنية سيمون مشيه وساعة مش مضبوطهههههههه good luck
ANOTHER TRAPPED SOUL..YOU CAN CHECK IN BUT YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE..WELCOME TO THE HOTEL CALIFORNIA..
Omggg
come to Europe nessa
Wow
This sounds like tom’s diner
I thought the arm had a tattoo of cooper...
I like Nessa Barrett and I want her to succeed. But I don’t know about this one. The tone is so off. The subject matter of the song kills the vibe that it’s going for.   I’m guessing this is supposed to feel sad and depressing, but if I was tired of living in California (or anywhere for that matter) I wouldn’t be sad or depressed, I’d feel angry and annoyed and frustrated. There’s no frustration to it at all, so it just sounds like she’s complaining. It flattens out everything and makes the song complete nonsense.
USA 🇺🇸 😘😘😘
Klinkt een beetje als Suzanne Vega, Tom's diner
i love Nessaa ❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹
Tired of California me to🤩😍💃❤🔥 does she kinda sound like billie ellish or am i tripping? Lol👀🤣
Очень круто
Nessa...Babeee I love itt
higher self vibes <3
te amo Nessa
always beautiful 🤍💕
what’s the thing in the beginning? like the radio sound. wtf if you listen to parker winston’s green eyed baby it’s identical. tf is going on
I'm tired of Cali too 🥱
THE HAND BRUH
best song out of the new album idc
I love you nessa
This is incredible 🥹
the talent, the vibe, the EVERYTHING
ótima musica
bop
hi Nessa, I'm crazy about your new album, at the moment I have unnecessary violence on repeat it's just crazy how you touch the soul.  I'm from Russia and I can't listen to it through the local Yandex music apps and in contact (like Facebook is local).  Can you please your Russian listeners, do something to get your tracks out on our platforms
Wanna come to Florida?
Honestly such a good song! she slays every time ❤
honestly nessa is pretty but she is wayyy over hyped
Hotel California vibes
Lo mejor que escuche en días, ella tiene un bien futuro en la música
Completely amazing 😍
sounds like knee socks
I wanna see Nessa star in a seriesss😍🔥
I do study Nessa barretts songs
I know the WHOLE thing and it just came out
I got chills when the kids started singing.
Suzanne Vega, DNA - Tom's Diner, sounds familiar :)
So good
It’s been bugging me for ages but the first like 2 seconds with the radio static is taken from British singer Alesha Dixons song ‘Radio’
Okay she ate and left no crumbs
I'm so tired of California, I'm so tired of L.A Where the real thing comes as often, as the California rain) I get sick of sunshine, on my perfect skin Vapid conversation, giving me head-spins Driving down Mulholland, closing both my eyes Cause they say you get more famous when you die  And everyone seems fine Am I losing my mind?

I'm so proud of you ness!! ilysm 🤍
Bro The Weeknd warned y’all about LA in 2020 bud nobody wanted to listen until they feel it. “Los Angeles is where all the monster of the world come to gather”
ness never disppoints
this song is so beautifully written.
One word: Slayed.
Low key slaps
Now that I listened to the entire album I can safely say that this is my favorite song ❤
Nessa’s the only tiktoker I think that will actually succeed in the music industry
my favorite song
fcking Love it..!!!  Cali-fornia dreamin!!'
2:11 young forever
Love it❤️❤️❤️
❤❤
I’m grateful for another song that I’ll listen to every day, too beautiful
Dnt know her from tiktok but honestly she'd be more successful with her music love to do a remix to this
The chorus at the end with the young girls…Ness, good job bringing some actually rock vibes into pop culture music. You’re doing your own thing, and it’s truly beautiful.
the beginning is similar to "la di die"
Literally on repeat everydayyy, truly amazing💕!
Hhhh
I know im 39 but could i marry you special women. I would let you lick me everywhere!
wow, the choir hit it out the park
At least 1,000 of these views are from me
<3<3<3<3
Her music videos give my AHS vibes and I am ALWAYS here for it

yo :🧍‍♀️la música de Nessa:💗= 💗🛐
Great video Nessa!!!
can we appreciate the cooper tattoo tho
اللحن مسروق من اغنيه سيمون مبسوطه 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Found this song today! IM OBSESSEDDDD
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE 🛐
i think when i get old i’m also gonna kidnap younger me
this is exactly what I needed
this music video gave me chills. the younger versions of her. the older version of her driving her around. the casket scene. nessa is brilliant as a lyricist and at telling stories thru her music videos. nessa is my absolute favorite forever, never dissatisfied 🖤
nessa is so fucking creative
Wish there was a way to upvote but also indicate I don't want this added to my Playlist.  I like a lot of things about this song, but it's not what I normally listen to.
🥰🥰🥰🥰
Your voice is so amazing💜💕
I love Nessa's songs so much, she has such a soft and pleasant voice, it's a paradise for the ears
It sounds so much like “Centuries - fall out boy
this is definitely for the younger generation
Несса мені дуже сподобалася пісня ти найкраща ти заслуговуєш на більше ти молодець💗
I’m obsessed ❤
So good! 🥺🖤
averiL Lavean
it remind me of knee socks by artick monkeys dont know why
Counting down for Friday !!!
Nessa never disappoints!!!! We love you Nessa!!! 🥳🥳🥳
More down here to Defuniak Springs babe.

Ness your music is more than PERFECT, it brings me peace and always makes me happy, congratulations 🤍
I love nessas tattoos especially the one that says cooper

🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
This is so good ness
Her voice is beautiful and every song is art, she is PURE art. She’s not just a tiktoker going to music for an extra cash grab or to follow the trend. She’s got amazing talent unlike all these other tiktokers running to music just because.
nessa baby, you are killing it. im so proud of you <3
😍😍😍
Well, you probably need to move 😂
WAIT THIS IS REALLY AMMAZINNNG
the song. the music video. the aesthetic well everything about this song is art. truly a masterpiece plss I can't stop listening to it!!
Talent girl 👧👏
ILY
move then
nessa never misses bro, SO EXCITED FOR THE ALBUM
That's excully good :)
This bangs.. go off girl.
Lovely city California..
We are all so proud of you🫶
My interpretation of the music video and the storyline happening in front of us, is that she died in a car accident and she keeps repeating the same day over and over again. She's staying young forever, she's living young forever. But at what cost?  Also interesting to note is that her older self is driving the car that kills her. She's killing herself over and over again.
Love how La di die and this song correlate so perfectly, it’s almost like a before and after or more so a Then and Now. I love this!
Don’t hitchhike
NESSA GIRLY THIS IS AMAZING
This is so beautifully shot 😍😍 amazing ness <33
Smooooth

So proud of you 🫠🤍
ЛУЧШАААААААЯЯЯЯЯЯ!!!!!!! очень круто!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ecть фаны из России?)
Idk what “it” is but she definitely has it. The talent, vulnerability in her song writing, the visuals, and that mystery that makes you want to know more about her. She’s stunning and overflowing with radiant magnetic energy. I seriously love every song she’s put out. Can’t wait for her album to be released this week! ♥️💫🦇
Did she sample knee socks by the arctic monkeys ?
an absolute genius. another great song from nessa. loved the song and video. cant wait to hear the album babess proud of u🤍

The Cooper tattoo on the driver
i love you Nessa
Nessochka, this is unrealistically cool. 14/10 is my birthday, the release of your album will be the best gift. I will celebrate this day with your songs💗
I think she got "the ticket" for being more than just a tiktoker. I hope she makes more and more music and that in future she is known as singer.
it's so great
Am I the only one who didn't understand the music video? Can someone explain?
I’m so in love with this song
I don't even have tiktok this is amazing !!!!!
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤

E impressionante como a Nessa e talentosa,ela sempre pensou em todos os detalhes,as ligações que os clipes dela tem,as letras,o vídeo clipe,ela sempre pensou em todos os detalhes,a parte das crianças que no caso e ela pequena ela mas velha,as teorias tudo impecável não erra nunca essa e muito minha mesmo viu.Obrigado por nos proporcionar essa obra de arte
Linda demais uau
Kid Harmony was nice touch   to the song
Living in LA for nearly 15 years, I relate to these lyrics on so many levels …I’m still trying to get out… but like she says… it doesn’t work that way. Thanks for the great song.
Gets into the car with “cooper” at the end! Wild mind fux of an ending!
#nessa if you burn your mansion invite me first. We fake both our deaths and split ❤️❤️❤️⚰️😘
this is so good!!!
It sounds like Tom's diner
her music

so proud of you nessa, this is amazing!!💗
ness is the only good tiktoker turned musician!!
my queen, i love all of your work, you’re amazing 💕💕💕💕
I know a place Where the grass is really greener Warm, wet n' wild There must be something in the water Sippin' gin and juice Laying underneath the palm trees (Undone) The boys Break their necks Try'na to creep a little sneak peek (At us) You could travel the world But nothing comes close To the golden coast Once you party with us You'll be falling in love Ooh oh ooh oh oh ooh California girls We're unforgettable Daisy dukes Bikinis on top Sun-kissed skin So hot We'll melt your popsicle Ooh oh ooh Ooh oh ooh California girls We're undeniable Fine, fresh, fierce We got it on lock West coast represent Now put your hands up Ooh oh ooh Ooh oh ooh Sex on the beach We don't mind sand in our stilettos We freak In my jeep Snoop doggy-dog on the stereo oh oh You could travel the world But nothing comes close To the golden coast Once you party with us You'll be falling in love Ooh oh ooh ooh oh ooh California girls We're unforgettable Daisy dukes Bikinis on top Sun-kissed skin So hot We'll melt your popsicle Ooh oh ooh Ooh oh ooh California girls We're undeniable Fine, fresh, fierce We got it on lock West coast represent Now put your hands up Ooh oh ooh Ooh oh ooh Toned, tan Fit and ready Turn it up 'cause its gettin' heavy Wild, wild west coast These are the girls I love the most I mean the ones I mean like she's the one Kiss her, touch her Squeeze her buns The girl's a freak She drive a jeep And live on the beach I'm okay I won't play I love the bay Just like I love L.A. Venice Beach And Palm Springs Summertime is everything Home boys Bangin' out All that ass Hanging out Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis No weenies Just a king And a queenie Katy my lady (Yeah) And looky here baby (Uh huh) I'm all up on ya 'Cause you representing California (oh yeah) California girls We're unforgettable Daisy dukes Bikinis on top Sun-kissed skin So hot We'll melt your popsicle Ooh oh ooh Ooh oh ooh California girls We're undeniable Fine, fresh, fierce We got it on lock West coast represent (west coast, west coast) Now put your hands up Ooh oh ooh Ooh oh ooh California girls man (California) (California girls)
really good just need to lip sync better
My favourite artist ❤
боже мой, это прекрасно
At least you live in a half perfect life👀
This song "borrows" the melody from Suzanne Vega's song Tom's Diner.
Toms Diner.
#votefortuffgolem

one of the best music videos i've seen wow
Nessa and Billie eillish and dove cameron are my all time favourite artists but imagine if they colllabed it'd be insane, nessa has incredible talent beyond belief she deserves the world
The way Nessa expresses herself through music and creates a whole new unique style that no one esle has is truly amazing.
Holyyyy fuckkk 🖤 this is legit the best eargasm ive ever experienced in like forever ! Duddeee my goosebumps got goosebumps ! Truly a work of literal art x a masterpiece
Te amo nessa😭
nessa <3
nessa this made me feel understood not only the song but the video to thank u so much I am so proud of you !!
que perfeição
nossaaaaa
so proud of you 💗
i’m scared that she’s probably hinting her death, idk don’t come for me but she’s been talking about dying & death in almost every one of her songs, even one of her songs is called “i wanna die”. in her first song “la da die” she hinted saying  “i’ll be dead at 27 only 9 more years to go”. in her “i wanna die” music video she’s dead in the morgue.. in this video she’s in a “coffin” pretending to be dead watching what is happening in a perspective of being a “ghost”… i feel she wants to make good music to help everybody who listens to her art which is AMAZING btw, but i feel her music  is also a secret message that she wants help but also something to give to her fans to remember her by because shes planning to pass away. i could be assuming way to much & i hope i’m very wrong but idk why i have this terrible feeling that she’s trying to tell us something. 😢
well, to be honest, in our Russian language there is no sense in translation from English, but the beat is remarkable and sounds great, great work
OMGGGG YES
ness the song is perfect i have no words to describe how good it is congratulations for the talent and effort you had to make it
Her voice is comforting.
Her voice is calming and beautiful , The creativity in her songs . It's all amazing <3
the end is insane!!
Ness this is so good !!!!!!!
ness why are you so dreamy
npc music
I'm so tired of California too
nessa never disappointed me NEVER🤍
2:59 doeu na alma…
Seeing her growth has been really amazing. I followed her back 2-3yrs ago, she was just the sweetest,then I started to not care for the person she was not too long after I followed. I liked her music, then La Di Die came out & loved it. Her voice is unique especially coming from TikTok. She is really claiming the throne quickly and I’m here for it!!
nessa is so underrated, i love this song. i’ve never been more connected to anyones music but hers. she deserves everything cant wait for the album 🫶🏼
Eee
Ooo
Jjj
Kk
so gooodd
a Nessa macetou nessa

Hi Nessa, I'm not sure you'll measure me, but still, I just want to say that you're a really amazing girl, go on no matter what and believe in yourself and we believe in you good luck ❤️

Impecável
I’m tired of California too😡😡😡😡😡😡
An outstanding song! I dont know if I like it more than your song "Die First" as it's my current favorite song. I have over 1.7k plays of the song lmfao
Irte lejos escuchando esta rolita tan maravillosa, lejos del mundo y solo concentrándote en la melodía y voz de la persona que me transmite tanta paz <33
El concepto de esta canción es tan uff
Tired of California girls, more like it. All as fake and put together as this one.

Needa I fucking love you you’re iconic asf🔥🔥🔥
Неймовірна пісня!!!! Обожнюю всі її пісні💘
Honestly Nessa is so underrated. I wonder why..?
wow
superstar 🤍
You know I used to think people needed to leave California, especially the conservatives however that would be kind of stupid because we'd just be handing it over to them. Why don't the conservative and any other, who are over these horrible politicians, especially the Democrats that are destroying these beautiful states and cities with their policies.. need to stay and vote better and clean California up. Make California beautiful again! Maga!
THIS IS A BANGER!! 🔥🔥 cannot wait for the album, nessa u are so talented
Loveeee this! 😊
t amo tanto Ness do tão orgulhosa de vc💌!!

This girl is going places, I just know it.
Like the song idea, but it’s kinda funny, she has the same voice that the majority of girls in LA have. Like that forced babyish, "Bananeez and avocadeez" voice.  I’m so over this style of singing. Please stop. It just sounds so lazy.
oh my god you are amazing
It's very beautiful
You are so talent!!!💕 I love the vibes you put in your videos
LITERALLY THE BEST SONG EVER.
I LOVE THIS !¡ 😭
Coop is so proud
Nessa this is amazing
I Love ness
I love how she zoomed on her tats for Boop
love it
te amo nessa! te amo cooper! :(
Я обожаю твою музыку ❤
i am literally addicted to this song. love u ness
she's going to go so far in the music industry! incredible ness.
This is so amazing Nessa!
Ness is so talented! I'm very proud of her. Pre-save "young forever" 💜
Nessa eu te amo entenda !!!! O jeito como você canta é incrível, sua voz é maravilhosa perfeita, diva

Early
Nessa literal chills. This song is is just chefs kiss

FINALLY
The beat and the melody are the same as Tom’s Diner by Suzanne Vega.
Nessa I have no words to describe how perfect this is! ,I'm really very proud of you! I'm really very proud of you! this is perfect! you are so talented your lyrics and music are always perfect! I'm really very proud 🤧 I love you!
for a moment I thought the person on Nessa's side was Sab, but now I don't know any more.

She should get into acting too! She’s a star… the IT GIRL of this generation
This feels very "inspired" by Suzanne Vega's Tom's Diner. Very similar beat and chorus.

I love Nessa so much and her music  I’m obsessed with this video and song I’m so proud of her for everything she does and overcomes and she’s worked so hard for her music career and im excited to be on this journey I still listen to her Ep one of my faves is IHYMUYD 🎉❤❤❤
IT’S SOOO AMAZING, NESSA!
nessa >>>
Banger
Nessa is so fucking talented like everytime I think I’m impressed she just goes beyond that again it’s so crazy and she’s just starting the visuals and the kids singing genius she a fucking star
Я же не одна увидела тату с именем Купера 😭
que música incrível!!
nessa você é tão talentosa
Nessa, you're way too nice and talented to be destroyed by toxic California. Everyone is so fake and you should go live anywhere you want and make music from your house. I hope you're able to find a man that wants to spend the rest of his life with you and never take advantage. You're a rock star, boo 😘
omg how proud I am of Ness is inexplicable, the song is incredible, really incredible, ness for sure and coop is also very proud of you <3
The childrens voices give it an errie vibe and i love it 🖤

I’m so in love with your brain oh my god.
So proud of you baby
I would definitely adopt her
isso ta tão bom mds,umas das melhores músicas
I love this
oh my god this is insanely
💜😝
Yess nesss
The wrinkly hand at the end being her own, meaning that her older self was driving her around the whole time, gave me chills idk why
We all know that Nessa Barrett is "Tired of California" like this song is expressing 🥺 And I totally understand that 🥺🕊️
she NEVER disappoints
Nessa your songs get more amazing every day i listen to them everyday❤️❤️❤️
wow
Nice video Nessa and dope vocals  God bless you always on your career as an Artists friend
Anybody can correct me if im wrong but i think she died after she got out of the car hence the angels she saw. So forth, the showcase of her older self as shown at the end (same tatts) are initially covered with gloves bc her older self doesnt want her younger to know that shes “killing her” or ig saving her/ wants her to d13 innocently or metaphorically speaking to escape california. I havent seen anybody talk abt it. I hope this comes into the light cuz ness rlly does think abt everything in such depth
you're the best
Nessa you are very talented.The song and the lyrics are amazing❤️
Nessa, you're just gorgeous, I adore you.Your songs are just salvation, I love you😍😍❤❤❤
im so proud of u ness. this album is gonna be a huge break through for you in the music industry. i can't wait 🤍 love u
The little angels are so precious😭🖤 Ilysm this entire music video is absolutely stunning, I’m obsessed🖤🖤

I think that Nessa is really talented and she makes good music, but it just sounds SO derivative of Billie Eilish it’s almost hard to listen to. I want to her see her make her own lane

Nessa never disappoints.  I can't get enough of his music.  His music saved me in my darkest moments!!
Love all of your songs Nessa😘❤️
me diga nessa barrett, como é ser artista!!!!!!
Best one yet I love it
" I am so tired of California I am so tired of LA" Maybe she was referring to how imbalanced her life is in these Cities. California is where she has grown up  with all mental health issues. LA is where she moved to better her life and polish her talent but even there she has experienced the Worst.
Love it!
Just amazing!  Nessa looks in the frame just can't take her eyes off, she is one of the few tickers who has become a real singer, a muse for many and just writes songs fantastically. Waiting for the albuuuum
ILY ILY ILY ILY
ILYSM MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

Every song of yours hits me directly, deep in my heart! Who doesn´t know a situation that feels it would last forever and you couldn´t escape - a job you hate, a dying relationship, a god damned drug addiction or the own mental constitution. Wise words of a young woman...keep on fighting, keep on singing!
🤍🤍🤍🤍
Nessa knows how to make music. This is amazing.
so proud ness
I've never heard something like that, this song is amazing, since first minute til the end, all is amazing, I'm so proud of her, I love her so much, and I love this song, my favorite tbh im gonna obsessed with this song I knoww

The way Nessa expresses herself through music and creates a whole new unique style that no one esle has is truly amazing.
ITS OUT ROCKSTARRR
am i the only one who feels like this is a sequel to “la di die”? like she’s growing up and shaking off the girl she used to be? she’s releasing her own album and truly becoming her own person, not just some girl that’s bashed in tiktok drama and for her past relationships, but actually being acknowledged for her career in singing
me ha encantado!!!
This is so cute omg
OBSESSED i love u ness u saved me
Aaahh

Something about the scene where she’s in the grass in the same pose she was in for Pain made me want to cry. She’s grown so much 🫶
