Quien en 2025
16:44 Friday February 7 2024
This one
Even though its wrong❤
People can complain about the show all they want but they can't deny that the soundtrack was insane
Remember he said nothing is random….🤷🏽‍♂️this not being on the album means there’s a big picture obviously
The way Abel made this banger by sampling the Lego yoda death sound
"Do it"
Future....this guy don't miss🔥
Hey Bro. Nice Song. Good will be with you. For ever
this song needs more attention
Banging in this in my car
Abel... ator / melhor cantor do mundo!!! Aceitem! O Brasil te ama!
Song ?
2025 anyone?
Why not ? she's double hot like daddy Johnny
Bro, did anyone watch The Idol?
This has definitly played a role in his music career  Can't deny The Weeknd  been in his bag since day one, but that HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM boost is on another level! Dude’s literally unstoppable now. 🔥💥
used to listen to this all the time in 2023 it was even my most played song of 2023 i really wanna take back the memories this song gave me in 2023
Mad respect for this guy man. He grew on me. Carved his own lane 💪  Can't deny The Weeknd  been in his bag since day one, but that HIPVIEWS DAWT CAWM boost is on another level! Dude’s literally unstoppable now. 🔥💥
Feature Future Again The Abel
Down & dirty
_
Ep4 should have had less of The Weeknd in it and more of Jocelyn dancing in the little red top and skirt, and more of her and Ramsey getting their freak on
Anyone in 2025?
Nice❤
Até hoje não me conformo no fracasso dessa série, os visuais são impecáveis mas o roteiro é deplorável, porém serviu um clipe lindo.
🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯 song too fire
❤
Damn he had HUT on go before dawn FM
so beautiful
King or nada for me I know what I deserve 😛
And if not...do you idc
Prove it
Funk Brazilian Ritm
I am probably too obsessed
Oh whoa whoa ohh ohh yeah
Crazy intro
2025 is LIT already we are just getting started shit is about to POP TF OFFFFFFFFF 🎉🎉🎉🎉
I would've loved to see future in the video ! :(
Is it just me but I think this song and ”Do it” by The noise is super alike. For those who don’t know, The Weeknd produced music as ”The noise”. I think he took inspiration from his old song
We do the things but we know it's wrong 😔
Anyone in 2025 ✨?!
One of the most underrated weeknd songs
Why ts reminds me of GTA 6?
M.B.Vibe ❤ SMR
is it just me? I literally cannot stop replaying this track omg!
She is a copy of her Mom
01/01/2025 🎉
such a bop
DOPE
You’ll find Me where The Weeknd’s work is
I m very glad that we are of the same mind and you and both thank about chick
You outshine me and my uncle and grandfather joro and two gaming friends you are the biggest gambler when I watch you on the video what a mischievous little boy you are.
Fuuuuuuuture
Alguien me puede decir si el video es de una película? Y como se llama la película 🎥 🙏
I want to be with Future
Double Fantasy
A sexy video except for the smoking; nothing sexy about forced illness
Whenever rappers are featured they sound like homeless dudes. You can’t follow The Weeknd.

This that 80's melody Scarface Tony Montana alternate ending vibes 😂👌
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😤
Amazing 🔥🔥
This song's malody match with his old "do it" song 0:39
The show maybe shit (not like it’s his fault entirely) but the song is solid.
Pure crap, Just like everything else these days.
Love you ❤
future killed it Future goes in soo hard on this right here! Only reason he is getting more hits is cuz he is just watching that short on *my channel* explaining how all these rappers out here be blowing up so big
Idol kind of disappointed as a show. but this is a good song. and Rose Depp looks incredible here.
The weeknd soulmate can sing exactly like him.
lacks the wow factor playboi wtf😮‍💨🤦🏽
Song so 🔥🔥🔥🔥, but the video is soooo 🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
Double Fantasy beautiful ❤❤❤❤

I Can't Never Hate His Music  The Weeknd Just Comes Out  With Absolute Bangers Everytime
💋💋💋
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤
Modern day Prince he earned this title there may never be another artist like him for decades to come or ever truly once in a generation perhaps once in a lifetime WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE! I am grateful to be alive at this very specific time in history It's a weird time a bad time but yet a great time I choose to focus on the great times let music like this keep me going and prevail in this crazy little thing we call life It's a journey and for many of us our journey is still unwritten that's the beauty good things are still to come be patient manifest work hard focus on the bigger picture 💯
After watching this video, a wish came to my mind to buy an iphone 16...!!😭
1:58 = fantasy✨💭

🔥🔥
❤❤❤ só amo muito as música dele uma melhor que a outra sou muito fã
Aaaaaaaàaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah English or Spanish
I'm Johnny
I'm johnny
I realized this is the same beat from his unreleased song Do It. From The Noise. If you search it, it has the same beat this is just a more upbeat version with a harder beat. Lol he thought I wouldn't notice 😂😂
The beginning is everything😊❤❤❤❤🎶 🎵
Quel dommage que The Idol se soit stoppé Des mauvaises langues ont critiqué sans raison Sans comprendre Xotwod 4 ever ❌⭕️
My shit❤❤❤❤
G.O.A.T
This song really didn't need that rap verse, it just spoils what is otherwise a great track for me...
La mejor canción de The Weeknd I love
anonyme 2024?
again, bad interracion video??
😍
Anyone here August?
interracial xvideos?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😈
0ouble Fantasy is the title John and Yoko named one of their albums together, so I am not sure why you ripped that off.
Go time machine balls!
idk if abel is a lyrical writer even if he makes great music, i do know that he's a genius for creating this life for himself
WAS MY SONG TO HIM🖤
Funny they only like white girls. Y’all don’t like your own kind? Leaving black women to the curb? Smh
the track it’s an drug
I love the way you sing  the weekend Your beast, you are crazy, I would love to negotiate a beat or feat
my girlfriend said she doesn't like this. now is single
my girlfriend said she doesn't like this. now is single
future literally ruins the song
👍😃🔥🇸🇪
The world needs a collab album. These 2 don't miss
1:43
That 3:40 is 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I do miss my ex boyfriend I thought he would be my everything 😔 but I moved on

Another masterpiece from The Weeknd
ومن عاشق عدد 22 هستم

من رمز تمام فیلم های هالیوود فهمیدم
🥰

Wehe ihr rennt mir alle Naciye dem verheerendwn Krieg zu Derhal aber dann...hab ich euch nicht mehr lieb.😅

Abel knows how to make that MOOD perfect for everyone
I fancy wanting to live this kind of life being wild and free
Tabikide iğrenç klip mayonun çıkması ve havuzda olmanız🤢🤮
Masterpiece! This has ENIGMA vibes
عاشقتم ویکند❤❤❤

🙏🙏♥️♥️🇹🇭🥰🥰🥰
Is there actually something between Lily Rose and the weekend?. She's in more of his vids now mostly the one kissing him
🥰🤩💕
This melody sounds like an Interpolation of Fire by Ferry Corsten
Weeknd and 80s is a perfect match this music is addictive
I miss N care so much about Felipe especially when how  you always had a smile upon your sexy ass face even when you preach so much of the Lord., Personally he is waiting  patiently with the heavenly gates jot even the devil could take you soul remember he is separated from the night which is the darkness I'm the light behind the Table I'm waiting I'll give you my own plate. Along with God always will love to give just like Thanksgiving N Christmas❤ I wanted those books you had you always were holding onto that you were so I to studying!  Youll have Wine along with his daily bread!
Future was not necessary in this song
Jack Sparrow gonna be mad and the nad hatter to😢
Magic!!
THE MOST UNDERRATED SONG OF ALL TIME !!!!
Omg yeah this is mind blowing ❤😘🦋
Légende ❤❤❤❤❤
This mf says horniest things possible in his songs but still feels like its something good magical shittt...

How did Abel get the old director of the idol to direct this???
Maxton hall
Cool vibe I'm not feeling this beat first time
3:45 my fav
Beg me to slide in
🔥
All these famous people more than likely have ETREME SEX ADDICTIONS ... can you imagine his body count???
Able looks fine
This is one of The Weekend’s best hits ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
( The Weekend ) is blessed his extraordinary talent both his voice and music 💯. When I get emotional or stressful listen to his album to calm down my nerves. A legend is born in doing so an immortal rockstar ! 😭❤❤
Must have been gross to kiss the weekend.
The aesthetics in this video are on another level. The Weeknd knows how to create a mood like no other.
wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
I love you 💗💗💗💗
Weekend deserves a Grammy ❤
Why she kiss my boy ?😢
This sounds like he sampled 'Fire' by Ferry Corsten
This the only song on the Idol worth it😊
This one gives soo Xo Vibes🖤
The Weeknd is like the Taylor swift of male artists . he just never misses
Bro has something seductive lyrics !!
Essa musica tem uma batida top, parece um pouco com as batidas do Funk brasileiro dos anos 90/2000s
After Michael Jackson thank God we have weekend music to listen he is not that much talented like late legend but his music is very good 💯
1:40
1:41
Im from India, I love it👍👍

😎
#CzthaVillV
#HoldMeDoVVnV #V
the stupid rap part is spoiling the song. why do they even mix normal songs with rap.. spoils everything.
viajo mt com esse sample
Don’t let her dad Johnny see this
If the aesthetic (minus rat tail) and vibe was 3:06 - 3:26, this show would have been a banger.
1 Year Ago The Weeknd Drop This Magic Video❌⭕🌆🎵🎶😈🔥⚡🔞🐐⭐😎🩸🥳💯
God damnit
TEMOOON
I cant wait the new album
2024🔥🔥❤❤
Great singing, good music and disturbing lyrics. It's the Weeknd 😅
This song gives me hope
Future makes this song
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
nobody can beat The Weeknd fuck drake and all the other haters
Me: Then they lived happily ever after :P  Johnny Depp: I don't think I like that story T.T  Me: At least they friends for now :D  Jonny Depp: Hmpf T.T
lily looks just like her father
I know im late.. but im here now
nah this song!!! loved it since the first listen, the saxophone in the beginning is perfection. xotwod🔥❤
❤
El micrófono cuando escucha la voz de The Weeknd: 🤰🤰🤰
so ghoood
Son pareja 😏 la rubia y the weekend
Once you watch the show and come back and watch the video you will feel differently i can promise you that lol.(Not in a bad way either)
❤
The Weeknd & Future don't miss
When it feels so fucking right though...! 🫠✨️. .. u know?
Favorite song Ever ❤❤❤ Canada 🔥🇨🇦 top top mike dean wooooooo et la fille Johnny Depp juste débile dans la vidéo 🎉🎉❤❤🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
I ❤ The Weekand
Thanks🌹🌹🌹
This is tripple fantasy  Bad Bwoy tune plus weekends looking dapper
Let's be honest "the idol" was a big shit but the soundtrack is amazing
I feel like the weekend seriously exploited this girl, like yea she gave consent but I dnt think she really grasped what was being done. If I was Johnny I'd off that a-hole
Will you guys stop about the lyrics there are so many hit songs with luyrics like this andno one says anything
Weeknd walks in : Monday: I identify as Saturday
What a fantastic collaboration!!!❤
😢
She looks like her mom
This song 💯

The Weeknd is the sexiest singer, my future husband
im in love with this song
23 March 2024 8:54pm 🇿🇦
This was......  Julia Roberts  in  Pretty Woman  before She met  Richard Gere.
Abel should play drug dealer and rapper roles
😮

The song starts at 2:48
Did Johnny Depp's father see this? such a talented actor has a daughter who plays in YYYY, why only naked and with a knife in her mouth? no other roles? She won't be able to play Queen Tamara? Only with bare breasts can I cover this shame!
Fantastic song opening.. 🔥🔥
I just found this song. I'm leaving this comment today so after a week or a month, when someone likes it, I get reminded of this masterpiece 🔥
Does anyone know if there together because o my life I shippp
🤩🥰

Baby girl, I'm the only one who knows this side of you 🖤
This jam makes me wanna fuck...
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Trust ❤
promoting sin and bad behavior, smoking for young woman.
if this was supposed to be his album only .... then maybe one of his best album to be ..❤❤❤
She's young so she trying stuff. Like Miley Cyrus! She'll grow up and look back just like Miley and think I was young and did stuff I maybe shouldn't have done.  Girls now a days think they have to act a certain way to get attention and be famous. Unfortunately Sex Sells and woman are treated like objects and expected to take there clothes off to get somewhere. Like I said she's only in her early twenties and hasn't been out there that long so she's learning and growing as a young woman. I just hope my daughter doesn't grow up and act like this.
When you're running out of idea, just make an 80's album,
Thats johnny depp's daughter 😂
This is my new favorite song of his.  Its hard af❤
This song has just enough tease.. ❤
The true XO fans know that the song is sampled from his earliest song Do It.💕
I just love he's voice.  Next r Kelly with that voice. ❤❤❤❤
Music
perfect nice
He would be better off without future 2:42
I like, this song!

Que música, senhoras e senhores! 😍😍❤❤
I remember a old dj music ... anyone know the name??
Sounds like I'm moving through the Beverly hills road.
This song hits different when you grow up and understand life
the way I embrace this toxicity by King Toxic and the Prince Problems....*smh...while I click repeat*
Johnny Depp’s Daughter is absolutely gorgeous!😍🔥💃🏽
Cool👍
SOUNDS LIKE "DO IT"

İntro: Barış Manço - 2023
Barış Manço’s song Kayaların Oğlu clearly inspired the intro of Double Fantasy😉🇹🇷
Barış manço’dan gelenler 🙋🏻‍♀️
I hate people that can’t use proper grammar .. .
Too Bad this song is way better than that crap show that HBO put out.

Ok you are poisoning  the world with your secular. What are you thinking  earthly riches are temporary please repent. Plz do and tell the people  the truth so that they can change back to God. So that they die when God is happy with them and you. PlZ STOP POISONING PEOPLE.  your really happy seeing your fans go to hell. Stop this soon TURN BACK TO GOD I AM SURE THROUGH  JESUS HE CAN FORGIVE  YOU

Don’t you find it funny how this song begins exactly like Ferry Corsten’s Fire?? Slower, but the same: https://youtube.com/watch?v=04Uuarao5hM&si=vZf0Y-ZMlh7nBBks

❤The Weeknd inspired me to go all in  with my music . He was just like me , an artist trying to get heard .And now he's on top. It's happening for me , and I'm not stopping when it does !❤
Wicked games intro

❤The Weeknd inspired me to go all in  with my music . He was just like me , an artist trying to get heard .And now he's on top. It's happening for me , and I'm not stopping when it does !❤
Mesmerising.  He can spellbound you through his voice.Another blast. Love this song.
I can't stand Weeknd copying the  ways of Justin Timberlake - both Selena and Britney should execute their own revenge on their malicious ex-boyfriends...
Very good  song
The stick figure kills the video..
Escuchas Double fantasy en Agosto, y te das cuenta que estas haciendo bien las cosas, ya falta poco para el grow up general (conocimientos, físico y financiero)
Future went in🔥😈
Is truth
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
This is our classical art..😂  At the level of monalisa
Anyone else bummed a lot of these scenes didn't make it to the final cut? or with the show not matching the songs or any expectations in general?
This song makes me wanna stay up all night with the lights on listening to it until sunrise! I don't think I'll feel sleepy in the morning, 'cause it will be like I drank three cups of coffee with a lasting effect! ❤❤❤❤❤

Good theme for Wrestlemania 40
The intro just makes you want to get nasty. 🤣💚✨
I like how u use real beautiful models instead of oompa loompas
The synth always get me 😢😢😢😢❤
Eh this is Mid compared to stuff he’s done. Just another copy and paste.
Abel forever
Great song🎶🎶👍
O the weeknd erra nunca ❤❤

534  k comments if you find me then you're a LEGEND 🔥
wick or amung old beats
This beat is from when he was called ‘The Noise’ called Do It
The Weekend acaba de se tornar o artista mais escutado do Spotify. Primeiro lugar no MUNDO! O único a bater 100 milhões de ouvintes mensal. O cara morou na rua, filho de imigrantes, negro, inspirador e de uma criatividade jamais vista! A revista Rolling Stones em 2021, diz em uma matéria nomeada “Por que amamos tanto The Weeknd” que ele pensa fora da casinha, tem originalidade melancólica é que suas letras transmitem sentimentos de nostalgia, conseguem passar a dor dele com as referências da sua vida, da vida da fama e duas consequências e ainda carregam peso mesmo nas canções de amor. Uma mistura de R&B e Hip Hop Que com um toque de pimenta e sensualidade, faz dele um dos artistas mais criativos, completos e original. Ninguém faz nada parecido com The Weeknd. Eu não diria que ele se compara a Michel Jackson, mas ele carrega uma energia muito parecida dentro da personalidade e da proposta dele. Suas músicas não são Pop então não pode ser comparada com Michel. A todos que tem uma oportunidade de ir a seu Show da Turnê After Hours , recomendo muito. Fui, e foi um espetáculo de arrepiar. E posso dizer que me senti diante de um rei da música e produção. No futuro vamos falar muito dele. Porque ele realmente tudo que toca e cria vira sucesso, fazendo dele um artista com potencial pra fazer historia! After Hours já foi o seu marco histórico , ainda vira muito mais!
I live in Toronto and within 20 minutes I can be at Drakes house or the house the Weekend grew up in. Crazy how much talent came out of the 6. That doesn’t include Shawn Mendez or Bieber.
The only thing rescatable off the cringe af series
I LOVE THIS ❤️🤩
buena música
Who’s still listening in 2023?
1:06 abla giymeyi unutmussun
This song is amazing ilove weekend very much ❤❤

These guys always get they want. Let them have the ride of their life that's all they get.   Small things. Smartphone is not a

I'm a seventies child and I love his music! No matter your age you can still love music and I love all his music and him too!! Would love to see him in concert one day!
How is this song still this underrated? I dont get what people arent liking about it it's amazing in so many ways

Abel can put he's hand to anything a very talented singer the best❤
Loving this song n video.❤
The Weeknd keeps raking W after W
🔥🔥🔥 on repeat
Te gustan delgadas verdad? Super moldeables you know 😅 algo en común crazy.... 😅
Kissland vibes for sure 🙏
The Weeknd just keeps bringing out these bangers. Love the old school synth vibes, very 80’s !
I absolutely love this song ❤
Did he relax the hair?!!! Please don't go the MJ route... your are a black man ie. Short or afro... please be proud... you looked good and attractive/sexy to date no need to relax your hair. We are all difference and attractive as we are... just think that in fact you built your career while you had an afro or a dreadlocks.. for those watching be proud of who you are!!
Abel never disappoints when it comes to music, the guy is fucking awesome
THIS SONG IS INCREDIBLE! THERE IS SOMETHING IN ABEL HIS MUSIC THAT IS MAGICAL.
Akon.i wanna love you song music
90's sounds....the beats....just amazing...

하 논란이 까도까도 계속 나오지만 음악성하나는 진짜 뒤진다 ... 개빡치게한다 드라마는 전혀 내타입이아니지만 노래때문에 매력적으로 보여 존나 어이없어 더주말;

It’s the saxophone for me at the beginning 😂
So this song is part of The Idol ost even before The Idol release. This is the first single not the Popular.
God❤
Thank you 🙏 💋🥰🙌
What she smoking virgina slims?
😂😂
This should have more views than other songs of the Idol
Our new make-out anthem
Song is fire. Love the show. Fuck the haters.
So every straight man’s fantasy
The weekend vibes for good
weeknd thanks my bro!!
Future didn't need to be in this...
This song makes the whole show. Which is already amazing
The whole series was magnificently shot. Take a still of any second and you will get a beautiful photograph.
You want the hits? He gives you the hits.
كان مو ضروري تحطو جيني خلولنا بنتنا كما هي لا توصخونها زيكم يا وصخين😒

A song to a movie💀💀💀
Best thing about the idol is the music
❤️‍🔥
where is the first version
Encore un carton the wekend🥰
absolutely not.
This song is the BEST ❤❤❤❤❤
Started Looking at this video and thinking oh nice maybe this is an 80's trope. Nah I was wrong. it's just trash main stream
Amo y amo
I wonder if johnny has seen the show lmao but he was with kate moss shit, i bet he is super proud of proud of Lily regardless
Glad the female version of Johnny Depp is finally out !
Weeknd, we love yaaaaaaaa
Amazing! Future part is a great compliment as well!
Like father like son - Johnny Deep
The show is a mess tho
Stevie b.
all i want to say is „do it“. xotwod
Lilly Rose again,his new flame?😁❤Nice song

Esto es buena música ❤❤❤❤❤
Is that Johnny Depp’s daughter? Great song.
Lala from vanderpump rules would of been amazing in this video too
I’m in love with this song…The Weekend aim Next😍😍…XO
The Real is Back my friend 🤪💯💯💯💯💯
The idol is great.. I don't know everyone is hating on it!
The beginning when the music starts reminds me of the movie Scarface🤔😉😁
Hope Johnny doesn’t see this
Can't get out from my head
The baby crying... just out of earshot....whos idea was that.
👌🏿
Lol the idol is so cringy
I MISSED THESE VIBES IN HIS MUSIC!!! Thanks for the great song man!
Abel out here looking like Ice-T early L&O days 😂 and did Future have the nerve to say "Gotta be cautious can't pay no support"?! 😂
"If it ain't XO🖤 Then you gotta go" we can literally see the meaning in this song❤
Weekend unique song always ahead the latest.👍👍🎤❤️
Of course future is involved lol 😂
This song trash.
what a song superb
If you’ve been on the club scene and been a part of some of the shit Abel is doing in this video, you can relate to this song HEAVY
Abel ain’t able to act…at least he can sing lol
future really didnt need to ruin this song
Always the best 🔥🔥
After long a song from The Weeknd that's addictive....
Every time I hear the Weeknd it just gets better like fine wine.
W song w series w theme
Can't believe that this show is about Selena G. 😅does that mean she's an actual baddie 😍
show
terrible how she flatters him like a prostitute.  this has nothing to do with respect and true love and gives today's youth a wrong picture of love. So sad.
Love it 👐👋❤️
How is this song so good HUH 😩
i love this song
Loving this song currently my favorite 🙌🏼
This song will blow speakers 🤘
Tetros don’t play iyk yk
Such a terrible concept

I love mysterious Abel...the one that doesnt do interviews. But im loving this show.
Finally, the very old "The Weekend"
The weeknd bringing old school vibes does it really well. I love the soundtrack, and the series.
100%
망했네
he is an awful actor and a repulsive man, who is  harassing and objectifying a girl much younger than him.
The Weeknd is such a great singer. He has an amazing voice!
This is fire! ❤🔥
Back to what he does best.  Love making songs.
Copying Chris Brown at 1:29 with Chris Brown’s “Dueces” song
I just finished the second episode and went from hot and bothered to runny nosed crying. I lost my Mom this year. It's a disaster. This show has me on such a roller coaster.  I've never seen tv that made me feel like this. And the music is incredible .
Ooooooooooooooooooowh
It took way too long for the beat to drop. I love a good beat drop though.
wow.
That saxophone riff though 🥵😍
I love this song ❤❤
Anh yêu em Trang ơi
ትመቸኛለህ ያገሬ ልጅ የኔ ምርጥ
The song is amazing but the TV show is all shock value, no substance.
os caras querem fazer uma historia com madonna, mas nao tem a humildade de pedir e pagar os direitos autorais e tmb querem fazer assim pq qerem liberdade criativa
Didnt realize weeknd was capable of putting out ass songs. Mid weeknd. Mid future
01:43 the best
I love youuuuuu
Pls just sing and never act
weekend face is so nice
Ahhh this released at my birthday 😍♥️🤌🏻
Is no one going to mention that Future totally ripped off jcole "middle child"???
dang so much smoking. its bad for your lungs.
OHHHMANNN talk synth to me!
Backing keyboard track sounds like duran duran serious...
Моя девушка сошла с ума из-за этой песни, просьба к парням, не включайте и не показывайте им эту песню
Underrated
Пісня 🔥.
The weekend ain’t freaky in this show just creepy. Always found him attractive but not like this 😂😂😭😭😭😭😭
Furacão 2000 agora ta na gringa, sensacional
Oh yeah, opened the show - instant regret. First scenes - obese, trans, drugs and porngphy pushed. Wish I was born in 80's
I am now 44 years old. for me Abel Makkonen Tesfaye (The Weeknd) is one of the best talented singers after Michael Jackson and Prince.
XO❤
2023😊
Dmn 😩 i love him
When two arts collide, they result into greatness and sense ecstasy. GoOD L(OOK)uck(S) !
Best actor <3
The weend hát khá hay và Rose depp 99 rất đẹp đôi Tây cần đéo phải mặc

La medelo linda como la madre, Vanessa Paradis.
Abel looks like Cat from Red Dwarf x cute tho
Master piece
Song on repeat 🔁

https://youtu.be/aNHQdhK1OlM
Perfect song perfect girl
lyrics in 2023 be like :
This is genius marketing for the show to have Lily Rose Depp in the video with scenes from the show
I’m addicted to this song to where I have it on repeat now! I love this song!
The beat kind of gives of Scarface vibes if ykyk
Megaaa❤
Porque nadie habla de la actuación de la hija de Johnny Deep 😍 Lily-Rose 🔥
This show gives me huge “Showgirls” vibes lol 🤦🏻‍♀️
Ils sont magnifiques tous les 2!
Dancing with the Devil 😈 “The Weeknd”
Predobra😩

I've listened to the Weeknd since 2011, hence no one knew what he looked like. Im so proud!!!! Aqua bro!
This girl is headed down a road of disaster. Just watch.
The weeknk comeback with his talent
i keep hearing ferry cortsen's fire
I cant w the braid😂
Saxophone is my favourite instrument ♥
"THE IDOL" must have been inspired by the Jabba the Hut & Slave Leia scene from "Return of the Jedi". Only the most hopelessly obsequious woke enabler would ever consider the bloated and boring weak end to be sexy and seductive. Watch him trying to rock a trenchcoat. It's laughable yet we're supposed to think he's slick. It's easy to be a hustler when the bleeding heart big shots have been brainwashed into believing that they owe you stardom. Anybody else spouting such cheesy porn talk would have been rightfully dismissed as a clown pervert. It must be sweet to have the system so thoroughly rigged on your behalf that the world is forced to accept the preposterous premise that the unwatchable weak end is some badass super stud, lest we be found guilty of violating some PC dogma.  Part of the time, 'THE IDOL" wants to be a satire poking fun at the usual show biz phonies and flunkies. But then it pretends to shine a harsh spotlight on the sleaziness of the music industry, while at the same time celebrating the sleaze. Back in the seventies, nobody cared about the sleaze because the music was great. But then MTV and madonna took over and the quality of the music became irrelevant. The MTV boom era faded away a long time ago, but the music industry is still stuck in the tired and tiresome post-madonna paradigm of bubblegum narcissism. Why? A TV series that answers that question would be worth watching.   http://www.reverbnation.com/QANEIDA
I love it❤
Why ya all thinking the series is trash? Dame ya all must be high on something Best series this year Very intriguing
Aww🔥🔥🔥Abel 🫀😍
Tô amando a série The Idol
why does it get better everytime? and why does it give me goosebumps? seriously this is sounds heavenly.
It's the blend of everything that just makes it  awesome 👌🏿🔥❤️🇰🇪
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So good
This series is hard trash… but this song gOes hard
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ luv u ❤❤❤❤❤
What is so impressive is that the only way you can totally be a fan of Abel is that you have to agree that this sound he has is inspired by all of his demo he has thrown away and now we get to hear it and this time it’s a throw away.
This new song from the weekend reminds me of the soundtrack of 50 shades of gray
his songs make me feel the real love  of old times. the times when we were innocent and pure!
I want the version he had showed on the show 😭
So like I just watched episode 2 of The Idol and this video makes so much sense now.. iykyk..... Good promo skills
The intro of this song bring me back to the intro of Streets Of Rage game🖤
TheGod
can someone explain his hair style? Seriously what is that
I’m not really a fan of this kind of music it’s got a robotic techno sound the lyrics are good I just kept thinking how much has changed with all this techno stuff
This guy A1... been on his music since the 1st 1
I can't express my feeling omg
If The Idol as a show is trash (don't know as I haven't seen it), then at least the soundtrack is 🔥
Watching from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Что за девушка кортконожка?😊  Уикенд как всегда 🙌🏻 🎉
Me encanta la voz de The Weeknd
His compositions cannot be better. What a masterpiece
I HATE WHY FUTURE IS IN THIS AND THEY KILL THE BEAT FOR HIS PART
I miss old weeknd and it’s giving that vibe thru this song ❤

I see Future still hasn't learned to talk after all those years.  Unbelievable.
But what exactly is wrong ? Is she underage ? WHATS WRONG
Martin Garrix live long and prosper  and metro boomin in your house n*****. Honorable mention to Ilayarraja
The song and music is awesome but I think the rap wasted it
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd] Temperature risin', bodies united Now that I trapped you in my arms No need to fight it, no need to hide it Now that I've seen what's in your heart Baby girl, I'm the only one who knows this side of you And baby, you know that I can pull out what's inside of you  [Chorus: The Weeknd] Even though it's wrong It's wrong Even though it's wrong, baby My girl Oh-ooh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh-oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh-ooh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh-oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh-oh-oh  [Verse 1: The Weeknd] You want me inside it, beg me to slide in Knowing we should have never met Girl, when you ride it, see you decide it Don't say those words that you'll regret Baby girl, I can tell that you think that I'm right for you I already know that it's not true, but girl, I'll lie to you  [Chorus: The Weeknd] Even though it's wrong (Yeah, yeah) It's wrong (Yeah, yeah) Even though it's wrong, baby (Yeah, yeah) My girl (Yeah) Oh-ooh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh-oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh-ooh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh-oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh-oh-oh  [Verse 2: Future] We do the things, but we know it's wrong All on my skin, you all in my palm I sent you an envelope, came with a poem You possess venom, that came with a charm You get the good out me when I perform I know the bad in you, that's what I want And you a baddie, you turnin' me on Fiend for your demons, I know where this goin' Love when you fuckin' me, talkin', I know what you doin' Caught up in love, what the fuck is we doin'? Models and bottles with us, ain't nothin' to it I tell you, "I got you," that's well understood Your legs on the bed, got your head on the floor We go out shoppin' whenever we get bored We get it poppin', leave nothin' in the store If I go to Saturn, I know that you goin' Fuck me on Saturday, early in the mornin' Flyer than a bird, she gon' open her door Screamin' out murder, but showin' you remorse Gotta be cautious, can't pay the support Stars in the ceilin', don't feel like a Porsche Came from the trenches, just livin' at war Once was a prostitute, I can afford you The one I adore  [Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd] Temperature risin', bodies united Now that I trapped you in my arms No need to fight it, no need to hide it Now that I’ve seen what's in your heart Baby girl, I'm the only one who knows this side of you And baby, you know that I can pull out what's inside of you  [Chorus: The Weeknd] Even though it's wrong It's wrong Even though it's wrong, baby My girl
the real fantasy is that every scene is from the "the idol" web show and its frikin amazing

Really??🙂
Lily Rose Depp <3
The fact you can see the sod roll lines in the lawn at the end completely ruins the idea these people have any idea on how to schedule a music video shoot.
Meu Abel nunca errara uma música,música não,que isso não é música,isso é obra prima 😘😘
É incrível! Ele não tem nenhuma música ruim. Só musicão. É difícil escolher a melhor 😂.
que música gostosa e quente de se ouvir! Um dos melhores feats já feitos até hoje!

Giga guwno nawet nie ma 20 milionów
They’ve never made a bad song together.   I feel like this is an end of an era .   I’m glad I was around for it. They put out some hits.
Is that Do it???? I see what you did there 😂 I love it

I have lived this life and this song makes me remember those good days I have always listened to the weekend  he is a great artist ❤
Not gonna lie but the Weeknd needs no features.. He needs to go solo everytime
The intro actually sounds veryyyyy simular to 'Do it' of 'The Noise' EP :D

All these clips from the show kinda crazy
Me encanta todo lo que haga Abel 🖤😫🫂💕

Amazing sound and music. Pezzo che spacca...👍👊
The song & show sucks

Sad that all he's ever gonna make is soft ass boring music like this for mainstream instead of going hard and grimey like he did in the beginning

Awesome song love it
Who the hell is the girl in the video???!!!! Anyone please❤😍...
There are two types of singer.  1 - The Weekend. 2- Other all
It’s painful to hear Future sound so flat and dejected.  Damn near ruined the song.
Sempre me encanta 🤍
Can't wait for this. The weeknd is so dark and I'm here for it.
The Noise EP vibes, love it
I love you Weeknd❤️❤️❤️
Muito minhaaaaaaaaaaaa
DE LO QUE SI TENEMOS QUE ESTAR TODOS SEGUROS ES QUE ESTE SENOR SUPUESTAMENTE BIDEN,ES UN GRAN ACTOR DE HOLLYWOOD. ESTA ACTUANDO EN TODO MOMENTO, Y HACE SU PAPEL DE TONTO, NO DE PRESIDENTE,  MUY BIEN HECHO. ESPEREN Y VERAN EL FUTURO. LO SABRAN TODO. GOD BLESS EVERYONE.
PARA DIOS NO HAY IMPOSIBLES. EL SENOR TE SANARA.  GOD BLESS BOTH.

I love this song so much, his vocals are unmatched

i dont care what they say it's hard to  not believe they had something goin on for a min or wasn't deeling each other lol
Tony Montana Weeknd
this is just fire
La rythmique du début me fait penser au début de son premier son publié sur YouTube : "DO IT, the Weekend" ...
please the idol be good 🙏
the video is wrong because Abel should be the star attraction and the song is bland. In his red suit he was an actor. He could be like Bruce Willis or the guy in Prison Break. Hes got so much more to offer than just standing/sitting around looking at a woman dancing. Its like when he was with Ariana Grande. He just looked pushed to the side. Like he wasnt in charge of the project and just got his creativity suppressed. I hope his next project he kicks ass and shows his talents like he did in the red suit project.
i love it
Xo❤

Sir I think your name is spelled wrong It's spelled "The Weekend" not "The weeknd" sorry nobody else pointed this out
💗💣🔥
what's with all the fake comments lmao
Shout out to my Duran Duran fans !
I am sorry but this guy is as weird as they come to me, and he has a new cable series coming out soon ("The Idol") which, from what I have heard, will show just how sick and depraved he really is. His music may have many hypnotized, but he comes across to me as disturbed, if not psychotic, and I choose to STAY AWAY!!! Thank you.
You get the good out me when I perform...  know the bad in you, that's what I want...  😍😍😍
Abel knows world people music choice that why he always will be legend Ur big fan from ETHIOPIA 🇪🇹 🙌🏾🔥
Esta música me encantaaaaaa
Nice song🔥🔥
The Weeknd is so handsome 😍
Redundant, passe' trash. Nothing new here. Same 'ol rot-mind.

The boss of all bosses.. Keep your kingdom Abel, sky is the limit
Wow
Beautiful song bullshit series
Tellement maigre que cest pas beau du tout .. elle a prit la grosse tête depuis le tournage cest abusé
HBO is Satans new Bitch. & the Future destroys the whole song.
Having future on this ruins a really Dope Track.... Not the Move.....Release a version without him on it !
It gotta be viral
Musiiiiiquuuuue deeee racailllleeeeee😢
That's why he's the GOAT!
eu amo o the weeknd 🍒🍒♥️♥️

Another artist who doesn't disappoint with songs. 93% of his songs are 🔥

Pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee BAAABY , PLEASE  👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🖤⚘👑💋

You are trying to show all these dehumanizing things that you are currently showing in front of people at the Grammys, in your music videos and in every part of your work that you are capable of doing these evil things...  I am by no means a religious person, but I know that cooperation with Satan will eventually destroy the human race... The devil is between us... https://youtu.be/VcWkyOZLgUk
i loved this
al inicio de la canción pensé que iniciaría: You belong to the city, you belong to the night, living in a river of darkness!!! XD
Essa música me fez voltar a escutar abelzin

Trilogy ch2
The weekend with the daughter of Johnny Depp is like me with the Eiffel Tower - when I’m in France the photos only near it.
Thats the Aquarius kinda ART!😍♒️
❤
Great song ❤
phenomenal voice and beautiful song ❤
Lily rode Depp is so stunningly ethereal. Sexy, graceful, classy, elegant and enchanting all at the same time
Fantastic
Anybody else hear lady gaga dance in the dark in the instrumental?
❤
This makes me cry. All the people from covid. I had no idea. I thought it was a game...fast forward, I got a beautiful girl friend named Alana Scott and two side girls Lily Skiptyn and Amber 😅. I get whatever I want...but only if I trusted the good. All those people. This is why I hate witches. I hate evil. This is why I love women
It simply makes my soul leave my body, it's as if there was nothing else in front of me, only obstacles in the dark that I had to pass without seeing, I jumped over borders in my heart, I closed the windows of my Chest, I floated in my own imagination 😭
The melody likes blinding lights
Johnny Depp watching this be like: 👁👄👁
🇮🇳❤
Ughhh loved it like usual 😩😖❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Song of summer 2023 maybe
Just amazing love the weekend 💓👌 Abel 💜🎶🎵
Abel 🫶🏻🤍
the lady got the same out-looking as Madison Beer, honestly
Stranger things?
dude got the voice of an angel..
the song goes pup pup pap bup bap
The best
This is such trash, glad he’s not gonna be the weekend anymore he already ruined that imagine so much. give it back to Jeremy. He made The Weeknd after all and this is Abel admitting it by going back to his corny pop rnb kin Kane era
Lily 11 Sound 11 Lyrics = Man with animal instict  The weekend looks .. 💀🤣🤭
Can't wait for Lilly Depp to decry "exploitation" as a "young hollywood female" in 8 years after she ages out of hollywood and hits the wall 🤡
Omg i love this song
She reminds me of my fav stripper
First Abel song I don’t like. This is shit
It's a nice song, but the video crappy 😂
So the dawn is over?
I missed old the weekend 😢💔
Lily-Rose Depp is so beautiful omg 😍😍
Beautiful song 🎵 ❤️👍
I've been waiting for vintage Weeknd for so long
Wow jamás pensé verlo como actor , se ve muy bien.
🔥SIC🔥
I can't stop to listen this
listening this song 1st time - okay 2nd time - nice 3rd time - addictive. 4th time - can't spend without it a day..🔥
This is frightening.   Lily Rose, cant imagine how her daddy feels about his lil girl with these big boys.. its wild.  He's amazing with this song..  hauntingly, beautiful weekend
s
Very bad musica. The Weekend is very bad In my opinion he don't deserves money The Weekend is sheet
Okay but we need to talk about this 5 minute standing ovation the show received at the Cannes film festival! Bravo! ❤️💜🩷💜❤️🌹🌟 XO
Rap verses always ruin pop songs
Que música vei . Karalho !!
Nobody realizes this is the title to John Lennon's final album?
Wknd is trash....SNS
Abel sempre arrasa❤
You homered it again.. Greet from Venezuela (05/23/2023)
👀
both yall rappers is opps szeen come outside in the 6 lemme c u opps just bc of color str8 up
A Pirates Life 4 me 😂
amazing stuff!
the only one legend in english singer is wkeend ❤
MESMERIZING. Absolutely adore the jazzy bluesy tunes but also the synth pop retro vibes!! Getting some old school energy here too. Forever and always adore what you create Abel. This MV is beautiful too. You’re one of a kind, xotwod ♾🥀🩸
He's so sexy 😍 love the hair
❤❤❤
woww
the lyrics are just tooooo good, "you want me inside it, beg me to slide in" LIKE GOD DAMN
Nobody cares about Johnny Depp dylon spitting hot fireman
This is nothing  but Duran Duran song serious
Ya quiero que suba con la de Jennie de Blackpink 🖤💗
One of my favorites 👄💫💖
The girl reminds me of miley cyrus.. She so pretty
what an idiot that woman is
love this song i have it on repeat it's so good
This guy is an amazing artist
❤️🖤love it, can't wait to watch this
I wonder how much of a sacrifice the weekend paid to the Devil for such trendsetting songs. I bet the weekend must have paid a lot to the King of darkness the devil, who is  about to be thrown into the bottomless pit by the real KING _JESUS
This Double Fantasy song by The Weeknd ft. Future has a seductive music energy.
Johnny Depp: where's my compass ? I'm going for a weekend hunt 💀
dis hard up tap !!!
Finally the Adel ik
Weeknd will be remembered for generations!
Im too stunned to speak! This song is just pure magic. Literally the beat hits one so hard, the vibe feels unreal!
릴로뎁.. 비율 어쩔
Great and just perfect ! ❤❤❤ Lily-Rose... You're sensational ! 😍😍😍
Gsoto muito das músicas deles
No por dios ahí le copió el vídeo a tormenta de arena pero aún así me encanta ❤ su música tan seductora waaao ❤ se ve q hubo conexión pasión ... Todo
EVEN THOUGH ITS WRONGG 🎉
This song is fantastic.  Saxophone always adds major sex appeal to any song.  Lilly Rose Depp and Abel (aka The Weekend) have mad chemistry. Can't wait for this series The Idol on HBO 6/6.
This is his last song 😢
If it ain't snowing, he ain't going
Abel always puts HIS ALL into EVERY SINGLE PROJECT he does & EVERY SONG he sings!!❤ One of the VERY MANY, MANY REASONS WE ALLLLL LOVE HIS ASS SO MUCH, FR! 💯
They don't call him the starboy for nothing think about it.
Can't stop listening to this masterpiece ❤❤❤❤
Future feature was NOT needed.. HE ADDS NOTHING TO THIS TRACK WEEKND 100% KILLED IT
👽🌎💃💋💖🇮🇹
I enjoyed seeing these two getting intimate xD
Such a great song one of my favorites
🎉🔥
Who else laughed at Abel’s wig with the sausage ponytail? My girl was laughing pretty hard at that wig lol
The Weekend Will Always Be Remembered From Generations🔥🔥🔥This One Sounds Heat🔥🔥🔥
Why the fcuk is her name not written on the description box at least.
Chula pinche rola!!!!! Soy chilango y me encanta su música 😮
Love the nature shots in this   very breath taking visually , some talent here visually and that key pad bass line is bloody AWESOME 😄 oops wrong video
this makes me feel some typa way
Wait.. no blood & gore?
Hay algo que no haga bien Abel?
The sound and the video 😎🤩
This is on the series the Idol soundtrack.  The weekend and Johnny Depp daughter in that show.
Yes yes
When you look at the Weekend like his face you think like he's gonna have this deep voice or something but his voice is low-key soothing in a way. It's not too deep not too high it's a good voice
And Lilly OMG no words just sensual and classy just like her parent's 👠🌹
This song make me just want to make Love  I mean real realll Love 😘💕
Future stepped out his element with this and he killed it🎉
I was obsessed with my ex girl friend..  Then she left me, I am shattered. Its been 2 years.. I m not over her..   Neither I can get over her nor I can go into any new relationship.. I am stuck in forever vicious loop.. Sometimes even being a boy I feel used.. My body soul all sucked out for 5 years which I was thinking as LOVE.. After leaving me she slept with 4 guys..  🙂 ahhhh that agony and pain in my skin thinking someones touching her right now.. This song reminds me that again..
❤❤❤❤
My current theme song
Michael Jackson is definitely living inside the weekend ❤❤❤
O melhor cantor atualmente...🕴️

He's talented no doubt but I seriously don't like what he's preaching. He's a typical romantic nihilistic fuckboy.  He is mirroring the attitudes of many young virile men.  Nothing wrong with virility and hedonism, except that it becomes wrong when coupled with a "don't care" attitude.
🎼👑🎼
I leave my comment here so that when they like it I get the notification and remember that I have to listen to this song again  yo dejo mi comentario aqui para que cuando le den like me salga la notificacion y recuerde que tengo que volver a escuchar este temazoo

Who is the model?
I love this song. Gets better with each listen !
don's voice never disappoints, this song is such a vibe
Superando a cada dia mais
That beginning w the Sax's is a bit of Ethiopian funk, dope that he is paying homage and implementing it in his music!
I Actually when to go see the Weekend last year at his After Hours tour on July 24th, 2022 at Soldier Field while I was all the way at the top of the seats. It was a literal blast and His performance was awesome while singing along with all of his badass songs. My Main Favorite ones would have to be: 1.)- Out of Time from his new album. 2.)- Call Out My Name 3.)- Die For You which Is a classic. 4.)- Earned It. & Also 5.)- Often But watching at the new show Abel Is going to be In created by the same director Sam Levinson from Euphoria with Johnny Depp’s and Vanessa Paradis Stunning Daughter Lily Rose Depp Is absolutely marvelous. Which I also had a massive crush on her dad, especially when he was young In the 80’s / 90’s and lily’s younger brother: Jack Depp lol. Can not wait to see both of them In the show as well. This song and the cinematography Is pretty cool. 💯❤️
I love song all
The Weeknd always gets you through life and has vibes that hit the soul I'm blessed to be a 90's baby and can say I've been blessed to see his growth 💯😎😎
I FREAKINGG LOVE LILLY-ROSE!!!💕💕✨✨✨
❤❤
Thank yoU !!!! ❤️🙏❤️🙏🙏🙏
Lily rose depp is bae
After seen this video ...im jelous 😢🥹
Am i the only one who likes the weeknd more than his idol?
I 💜 U ABEL
Sexy vibes!! ❤
Avant je me sentais seul mais la différence et dans le genre de solitude 😢
i got distracted, so i had to watch the video again
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is another masterpiece of the weeknd , this man can never go wrong
Dope though
That’s awesome! Feel free to reach out.
Now we gonna to call  Abile tesefay ✌✌✌
That girl looks so familiar in the video
Abel, I am proud of you now.  But let me give you a piece of advice.  Go to Ethiopia and look at your descendants and people.  Look at your culture, your religion, we Ethiopians are not fighting with livelihood and economy.  It's from the fallen body that runs the music industry you work in.  But for the coffee I saddled you
ABELİM🔥🖤
The Weekend + Future = The Future Weekend 😂
Baby Girl ❤
I miss Miami nights
The Weeknd nunca falla, X100PRE el mejor
need that house of balloons vibes. I get 80-90’s synth pop
am i the only one who think it's a song to pickup girls now a days?
Why couldn’t the saxophone 🎷 opening been longer ? 😭😭😭
XO 🖤
Bro this song is so bad and the video… bro… what has this world become. And y’all, I’m just saying my opinion so don’t be making a scene trying to fight with me ❤

Abel Tesfaye

Abel tesfaye 💚💛❤️
Why is no one else also talking about Lily-Rose Depp in the video? She's beautiful! Excited for the series coming soon.
I’m happy I have a ticket to his music concert to be hold in Italy this year 😍
O cara só tem música boa !
The Weeknd delivers as an artist, a singer and an actor: what a treat! But also includes Lilly Rose Depp in both the video and the HBO series, can't wait to see it! She is as edgy and cool as her famous parents 💘
💪🙏💙
Deseando ver su concierto 🔥❤️
POV: You're rewatching this mv with him as Abel Tesfaye and not The weeknd 😭😭
Slayyy😂😂😮😮😊😊
The Weeknd always delivers with his music, it's clear that he puts a lot of passion in his songs ❤‍🔥

Non vedo l'ora di vedere com'è la serie. però, quei capelli proprio non si possono vedere, poteva tenerli come al suo solito invece di farsi quel codino? sembrano finti. vabbè.
But this is this vanessa paradis' and Johnny Deep daughter 😁😁. The weeknd remind me one of my friends who look exactly like him in that clip; same face, same hairstyle, same still in general....
Ass
You know future going off when there's a white baddie in the video 🔥🔥
Damn Lily-Rose Depp is gorgeous❤ I LOVE THIS SONG!!🔥🔥

Guys, try listening to Rauf&Faik.They are the unidentical twin brothers' pop duet of Azerbaijani origins and were born in Russia. Most of their songs sound amazing because of their music, and voices are incredible. If u feel their songs, u will definitely like it!

Yes mundy love save your tears love The weeknd Hb o me can buy myself ❤   💗save~your/tears   🎉after,hours  Emo,love  muity fufu o the weeknd  Roblox  tudi mundy love save your tears
She got you
Uncunt  Jems ,  version of Weeknd ))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
Muy buen sonido escucharla con las luces de la ciudad de noche.
Does anyone else notice an underlying theme of abortion when listening to the lyrics? Future's two liner "Screamin' out murder, but showin' you remorse, Gotta be cautious, can't pay the support" made me do a little double take, and the chorus "Baby girl, I'm the only one who knows this side of you, And baby, you know that I can pull out what's inside of you" along with the  themes of  rawdogging and guilt trapping seemed more intentional than a coincidence. And the pitched up vocal sounds like a baby? And then for a SUPER stretch the song title might imply some double meaning haha. Maybe I'm too high but just thought it was interesting.
Even though I know the message in these lyrics is wrong, you can’t help but listen to this song on repeat, even though its wrong…
Big love Abel ❤
Fart on me Weeknd please
80's sounds so good in this era😎
I keep thinking the woman in the thumbnail is Rita Ora.
🫶🎧🎵🎶🎵🎧🫶🇩🇿❤️
This song makes you realize how is the one that really you care about! This song is just for one you can share and feel it with!
Such a masterpiece🥰🥰👌👌
El abeliito nunca desepciona ❤

Wow, Jonny Deep daughter is really pretty
Super banger , future was sensational🎉
Encore une merveille de the weeknd ,clip formidable et lily rose sublime ❤
I love The Weeknd’s music, I do. I can’t wait to see him in Brussels in July. But this video… I started watching it and I couldn’t continue after just 30 seconds. My whole body felt terribly sick… 😞 Why objectify a woman so much? What’s in it for Lily Rose even? Is it art or something else? 😞  I can only imagine what the movie will be like, which I don’t think I’ll manage to watch… I can’t really explain how all of this makes me feel, because I feel a lot of mixed emotions, including about the Weeknd. 😞
Pornhub looking more elite
Best fuc*ing song ever. The Weekend is a legend.
Another Masterpiece by The Weeknd! Heart and soul into all his music 🔥♥️
Fuckin Dope 🔥

All his music has an indescribable sensuality🤗🫶
euphoria is for teens. the idol is for adults 😉

I can't believe my eyes! 😭 X°O
Great vocals but I hate mumble rap

Weeknd I want to smell your farts so bad
Every week I wait for the weekend

Who is the female lead?
Future 🔥
The 80s synth vibe would go so well with Stranger Things

C’est Lily Rose Depp !!
Mid
I can't be the only one that thinks johnny depp's daughter bad as hell

I'm hearing a bit of Do It by The Weeknd's The Noise. Anyone else?
Mmmh💕🚬🥁
Smash 🎉
The weekend should not ever do songs with any rapper. The mess up every song he lets them on. My guy does not need help!!!
Man i can't find any bad songs from the weekend. Love this song! Especially that intro with the saxophone 🎷🔥
Miss my one week stand 😂
This song remeber Stranger Things! Lol
Weekend featuring future but his past has gone
It's not even two week full yet and this video is at 92 mil then ppl is saying this man isn't next the Micheal Jackson
His passion for his songs is unbeatable ✨
Christopher Maurice Brown is the greatest artist of all times 🐐

Il est canon avec sa nouvelle coiffure. Vous ne trouvez pas?  J aime sa façon de réaliser ses clips et son style musical. Il a une façon de voir les choses, très moderne.
As a cocktail this is: Cointreau, whisky and smoked rosemary on ice

This song is  « All i know ft future » baby brother
Weekend's previous hairstyle was awesome 🥹❣️
I suspect that The Idol is actually autobiographical and it would still somehow make sense
The server in the beginning at 8:34 died due to epilepsy related issues. So sad
I left a comment because I listen to the song everyday. After that, I will understand by looking at the likes, how many people came to listen to the song and read the comment.
Мед для вух😌😍😍
I feel there should be a version of this song without future
Summertime songs coming inn 🔥🔥🔥
Love it
She is finished bro
I recently started a channel where I sing .if  anyone has a moment would mean so much thank you 💓

If you are a low life like me, your future doesn't have any workdays. It is weekend any day.

Left bleeding out artwork on the floor destinys children bitterness sorrow and pain this hole in my chest has been aggressively torn.. I'm here now fading into the infinite void cold and hollow ice screaming out for heat to take captive to numb this lack this want and need in this pain I'm feeling defeated destroyed... -J. a. Thomas

This Comment Is For The Future ♾️
All songs are masterpiece 😭💋
-And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.   (Deuteronomy 8:19) -For my(Jesus Christ) flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.   (John 6:55-56) -It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him: If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:   (2 Timothy 2:11-12)
THE WEEKEND ALWAYS ON  THE TOP HATS OFF FOR HIS DEDICATION

in song is sample from duran duran tune"serious"
İ adore to gorgeous woman body to touch and feel her with my heart and soul. İ wish to kiss her my lover's lips for hours and want to go to bowling with her, chat her for hours, giggle, wiggle, embrace her, proclaim her good attire with full of ostrogen's miracle differences between women and men in this world, making them smoothest ladies like velvets.
Igual yo!!!! Me encanta! Jajajaaj😅
Superb music
አቤል አርፈህ አትቀመጥም😂

I absolutely adore this track it just hits on those situations we find ourselves in where we're imprisoned by our obsessions!♥️
Can we get a version without Future?
Not me coming here every single day🤌🏼
Future is garbage
This is giving me R. Kelly Down Low vibes
Okay but why is his hair like Bella Hadid
Love is unexplainable especially when it’s genuine and not for wealth.   Weekend doesn’t disappoint 👌
The Weeknd: Temperature risin', bodies united Now that I trapped you in my arms No need to fight it, no need to hide it Now that I've seen what's in your heart Baby girl, I'm the only one who knows this side of you And baby, you know that I can pull out what's inside of you  [Chorus: The Weeknd] Even though it's wrong It's wrong Even though it's wrong, baby My girl Oh-ooh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh-oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh-ooh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh-oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh-oh-oh  [Verse 1: The Weeknd] You want me inside it, beg me to slide in Knowing we should have never met Girl, when you ride it, see you decide it Don't say those words that you'll regret Baby girl, I can tell that you think that I'm right for you I already know that it's not true, but girl, I'll lie to you  [Chorus: The Weeknd] Even though it's wrong (Yeah, yeah) It's wrong (Yeah, yeah) Even though it's wrong, baby (Yeah, yeah) My girl (Yeah) Oh-ooh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh-oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh-ooh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh-oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Oh-oh-oh  [Verse 2: Future] We do the things, but we know it's wrong All on my skin, you all in my palm I sent you an envelope, came with a poem You possess venom, that came with a charm You get the good out me when I perform I know the bad in you, that's what I want And you a baddie, you turnin' me on Fiend for your demons, I know where this goin' Love when you fuckin' me, talkin', I know what you doin' Caught up in love, what the fuck is we doin'?

🟥Why are these Africans only looking for white women? ⬛Do they reject African women because they are ugly?  Don't you like African women? ⬛So much that they talk and discriminate against themselves

I feel like the vibe of the song is a continuation of Dawn FM in terms of the synth and vibes. I LOVE IT!
Another perfection❤
I love both sound omg

XO AIN’T NOTHING TO FUGG WIT!!!!!!!!
Excitingly amazing ❤️!
how could you cut out the beginning in the radio version? its iconic..
From ,homeless to singer then a actor. What a journey🎉
The melody reminds me of the beginning of 'Dance in the Dark' from Lady Gaga. Glad I came her since I could remind myself this masterpiece. 😁 The Weekend did great as well here :)
The Weeknd always surprise with such unimaginable vibes. Awesome song. How many of you think the music in the start of this song resembles a little to the chorus of  daft punk's  song "Within"? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuj__JnGWLg
His hairstyle in this vid makes him look like an Narco Warlord's precious Prince, kinda dig it tbh
The beggin’ of this music delivery a Dawn FM’s vibe
These two Toxic kings need to give us an album😭👌
Jennie fans hit 👍
Nba young boy trending number1 for music 💯
ahhhh The Weeknd why you do this to us!!
X❤X❤ X💓X💓
The background music in this song is an old music from The weeknd's old song called DO IT(the noise)

Wrestlemania 40 theme music !
True XOs know he predicted his stardom (this level of stardom) in the video for “Rolling Stone”, where he asked us if we’d still stay loyal once he reaches this phase. Abel, my brother. We still are here. We are proud of where you are and we love you every step of this journey!! Love from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰 ❤

The weekend bringing back that 80s synth sound
2023biggest hit song 🎉
Retro style music is owned by weeknd
Johnny Depps daughter is fucking gorgeous and is about to be a star.
Mid song why so lofi? Bad tones
I've got a crazy, but absolutely 100% true story about my families weekend that everyone has to hear. Me and my wife and our 5 children, went to a beach resort for the weekend. We were having such a good time. We decided to go horseback riding, and that's when things started going south. Literally. Read on.   My wife was riding a horse that, well let's just say it wasn't the smoothest ride one has ever had on a horse. Yeah it was bouncing her up and down in that saddle pretty good. After we went horseback riding we went out to dinner at a place called See Food Eat It. Man they have some of the best seafood I've ever tasted. The waiter sat us at the captains table, but my wife wouldn't sit down for some reason. I asked her honey what's wrong? Sit down. She replied, I'm sorry I can't. That bumpy horse ride gave me a weak end. Yeah I guess you could say I was weakened when I got a weak end this weekend. I'm sorry I ruined your weekend with my weak end. Let me know how you liked my story about our weekend.  I hope you all enjoy your Saturday and Sunday. Everyone love everyone! Peace.
🇧🇷🥰
NOW I HAVE A FANTASTIC WEEKND! <3
The Weekend 🔥
Another banger by weekend.
this song slays, and this gets me even more excited for the idol.

SUMMER 2023 let’s get this money Let people go ,stack 🥶and move on 🌎
The Weeknd don’t know how to miss! 🔥
Always a black male paired with a white female, kind of odd. Look into the race mixing agenda, it's been around for nearly a century and is not meant for any good at all, and in real life this doesn't occur but they keep trying to advertise it. It's interesting, do your own research. Type in the race mixing agenda...
Обожаю❤
They always kills em songs 💥💥💥💥💥💥leave a like if u agree 🎉🎉🎉...dope sh❤t
Nice 👍💯❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Abel speaks words of the heart ❤️
Future is so trash
Sound like it’s from the 80s. But I like this one better than his other thee 80s sounding music
I would love to see what is in store for this series. <3
esto es una obra de arte te amo

It's ok but no "I can't feel my face" lol he has kinda lost his sense of humour since the RED Zombies Super Bowl thing...
Empezamos fuertes
Fam, is that a clip on or did you really grow your hair? Asking for a friend.
OK I’ve been a enjoyer of The Weeknd  But even I will admit, I think Future’s presence in this song is kind of weird
Someone please tell Future his presence in the masterpiece is unnecessary 😂

Another Classic One From Our Guys ❤️🔥❤️
The reason the weeknd has had so much success is because his music is authentic. He built a loyal fanbase through focusing on his craft, and not being pressured into sounding like other artists. Hopefully one day my music can touch the masses such as weeknd. But as for now I'm just happy being a fan

Secular rap Music is here to distract you, to influence you to sin and fall away from  God, music is one of satans biggest tool to hack your subconscious and make you sin more. These celebs work for satan Wake up people, How blantanly obvious do you want them to be with, lil uzivert telling fans there going to hell with him, Sam smith wearing a satan costume, lil Naz with satan shoes, back chyna having a baphomet tatoo its not a concidence. these celebs have chosen their side, and they have a mission to help lead as many souls to hell in exchange for worldly pleasure, Lucifur runs this world and hes making it real obvious right now and desensitizing us to sin, he runs the media, youtube, all of big corporation, everything he does is to distract you long enough so you dont get closer to God, so that when you die you end up in hell with him. This world will come to pass and where you spend is crucially important.God cares about your salvation not about how he can make you rich.  The most important thing in this life is not what's in your bank account not your career, not worldly pleasure, it is your faith in Jesus Christ because everything will come to past and worldly possession will rust . The better your relationship with Jesus is the stronger your faith becomes. Christ died on the cross for you so you can be saved from the eternal judgement of your sins when you die (Hell). The only way into heaven is to be perfectly righteous. It's impossible for us to be even good for all haved sin and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23). God doesn't send people to hell. You send yourself self there because you are a  sinner by default. God cannot allow sin into heaven. This is why your faith in Jesus is important because his blood is counted as righteousness because he live a perfect life and he is the son of God and is the ONLY way you can enter heaven. Do. Not add to the gospel or you will be tainting the finished perfected work of Christ. Your works can't save you, so stop adding that to your faith for salvation. being baptized does not save you, so stop adding. Being good does not save you so stop adding, ONLY YOUR FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST can save you.  You do good things because you are saved not the other way around.i dont want people to die in their sins then go to hell and remember they came accross this message and regreting why they didnt listen, jesus has gotten  me through so much and i cant thank him enough i owe my life to him and he didnt have to die for my and your sins but he did it anyways because he loves us and i want to spread that love anyway i can by leading people to his kingdom. I don't expect you to turn a leaf today, but I hope to plant this seed so that one day you realize Jesus  is our ONLY hope for salvation, but remember No one is promise tommorow so the sooner you accept him as your only hope for salvation, the sooner you can rest assure that have you Jesus as one who will bail you  out of your sin debt and accepted into the kingdom of God where you can live  peacefully with Jesus for eternity

Skinny slender BEATIFUL woman 😯😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 Lily-Rose♥️
wow!! great work man , as always!
Another one👍🏾
It looks like the movie babylon
Heyyyyyyy
I believe that “double fantasy” means the girl is bisexual and she tries to hide it but he’s “the only one who knows this side of her”. Look how he gets upset when he sees her with the othe girl. The Weeknd also said something about this in Lost in the Fire which people thought was about Bella: “you said you might be into girls/said you’re going through a phase”. So Bella might as well be the inspiration for this song. Anyway, it’s fireee 🔥
WOW NICE !
LILY IS AN ICON
I M SO LUCKY TO FIND THIS SONG WITHIN ITS RELEASE WEEK. ALSO FEELING SAD FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA FIND THIS MASTERPIECE AFTER YEARS .

Lily Rose Depp ICONIC
❤
Who's the model?
okay i see u weeknd giving pootie tang
Stumpestvideo ever. The usual sexist bs from a male artist .
I juz don't understand how you went from bangas like birthday suit, wicked games, and king of the fall to this synth trash. Like, I get it, you make music so you can chart and break records like MJ but your day 1s miss your old formula. Can you throw us a bone please. I can't get jiggy with this pop ish, AT ALL
this song gave me the vibes in a 4 hours drive late at night ❤️❤️❤️❤️
The Weeknd + Future = A Banger
AMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
the weeknd is a genuis
5th day of uploading on YouTube 6.9M watches ..  it will gonna hit 1 Billion so soon
Nice
Strang thing
sound is fixed
Johnny Depp's daughter???  Abel rock it again!!!!!!
Quando a lacração fala mais alto que o talento, lamentável
It's Alright but STARBOY hits different 😉
"Gotta be cautious, can't pay the support" muito bom kkkkkkkkkk Te amo abel
Abel is an Artist who is on another Level. He is not afraid to take chances. His Music is an Art ,  Think... Have you ever done something even though it's wrong?     XO
WHO KNOWS WHEN IDOL IS DROPPING 😭😭😭
WHEN IS THIS MASTERPIECE COMING OUT 😭🔥😩💦
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤❤❤ Encore une autre Bombe de lancé j'adore j'adore j'adore ❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
