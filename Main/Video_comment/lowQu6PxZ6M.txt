Wankdorf? Lmao
Tuubarahwafashl
Why the fuck are YB playing on artificial grass!?
I wankdorf to this
Don't even support UTD ,good to see CR7 back in the Prem .
Lmao Wankdorf
Unfortunate name for the stadium
Wankdorf hahahahaha   What next Clungeville stadium?
haha wankdorf
Ahhhh wankdorf, where the young boys play
Ole please put Donny at XI...i am pretty sure he still a player could adding power & qualities on midfield
Cavani?
Not gonna lie, thought this was a parody when I saw the name of the stadium.
Messi messi messi messi messi messi messi
Surely not the stadiums name 🤣
wankdorf LOL
Someone need to tell this Sancho kid to cross the ball. You have now Ronaldo in the box who is so good in air. Just don't dribble all the way to box and waste it again or cross it low. Cross the fucking ball in the air
This football club need investigating; Young Boys playing at the WANKdorf stadium 🤣
CR enter the field with right foot. 0:44
12:53 Aaaah Freddy bana okimia pass yawa
I think Ronaldo came to coach indirectly that's why Sir Alex got involved😂
Am I the only one who noticed Fred constantly giving away the ball?
It’s not a racist to state the facts.
Too many browns on the team.
De Gea; AWB, Bailly, Varane, Dalot; Fred, Pogba; Sancho, Mata, Lingard; Ronaldo
2:39 what ya think your doing there mate?
The what-dorf stadium???
Lingard always looks like angry...hahaha
He simply wasted 3 years at juve with overrated players ,😭
Semoga sukses di cip mu
Bailley might aswell find another team to play for
Ronaldo's footwork and cheeky tricks in the close passing drill is the best.
After watching a match against Newcastle what Ronaldo had done if he weren't gone to juventus. It would have been goal fest for manU and for him for last 3 season. Surely won a championship or league cup
The most bloated squad in the history of squads. So much waste looking at players who wont get a game.  I mean, Bailly, Mata, Dalot, VDB.  Careers wasting away.
Still amazing seeing Ronaldo next to Pogba in the same team... we are feasting this year
Tonight we have to win by three goals
Wank off stadium lol
Lingardinho có vẻ k được vui
I love manchester United 🥰😍🤩😘 Iam from bali
Just ❤️ scoring... hattrick
whenever Cr7 goes I followed him,im not loyal to the club I'm only loyal to the player that is Cr7 but I supported all the club's he joined.Now getting more vloggers  I subscribed because of Ronaldo just saw his picture in the caption immediately watch it.Cr7 supporter from Philippines.His a good player but really his so handsome
Ronaldo,Martial, Greenwood,Elanga,Lingard, Bruno,Mata,Pogba,Fred,Donny... You have to pick only 6! Haha Absolute headache!!
its funny how you feel that united will got trought to the next round easily with ronaldo and the improvements, thats a favourite team beahviour, go easy in the group stages and then game by game
Ronaldo orang baik, 2 kali dia datang ke indonesia.dia tidak bertatto dia tidak meminum alkohol dia punya gaya hidup sehat dan penuh contoh yg baik untuk generasi muda...alhamdulillah😊
Love to see Ronaldo chatting with donny
Ronaldo is very handsome here and the players are so respect to him ...they don't keep chance him to get inside the box...best of luck for today
Looks like Alex Telles with the hairstyle just the beginning
Someone should please tell me why ole is playing sancho as left winger
13:58 Fred even seems stupid in rondos.
14:20 lol
Young boys wankdorf
Seeing Martial and Ronaldo in the same frame is Fantasy World!!!🤩🤩🤩
GGMU 🔥🔥🔥🔥👍
Young Boys stadium is called wankedoff?
Having CR and Cavani among the top predator in the game, there are 2 things the other young strikers/wingers must do that's to create crosses from wing area or else dribble as much as possible to get into box. This will create plenty of free kicks and even penalties. Forget about 1 2 short passes to create for opening, esp when the opponents choose to park the bus.
The name of the stadium though. 😂😂😂😂
They should call him Goku, I think this guy could build a spirit bomb
Yb on target goolll Ronaldo.. don't cry yb
A team.of young boys at the wank dorf stadium you couldn't make it up
Everytime I see sancho not too far away from CR7. eemed looking like he will be mentor under CR7.
Bamos cr7 hoy seh gana si o si
Wankdorf 😂
Why Pogba always next to Ronaldo now , like he used to Zlatan?
Haha the camera only focused on Ronaldo. I wonder how these kids must be feeling, training with the GOAT himself
Happy to know that there are fans like me who is really excited to watch premier league because of cr7 ❤️... amazing guy he is and possibly we will win premier league and UCL this year....
We need to get on top of this game from very early.. So we can start making subs at the hour mark. To rest players and more so give other players like VVD, Martial a decent run out!.
Bro my eyes😭❤️
It's still not sinking in. I'm literally close to tearing up every time I see him doing things with the squad, wearing the badge
Nous sommes contente voire Ronaldo sur l’équipe de Manchester
Where is cavani pls  What is going on ?
Ronaldo with the black socks
What kind of name is that for a football stadium 😂😂
Lingard looks unhappy...
Just love how Ronaldo is keeping up the ball with Fletcher, and chats to him, doesn’t forget the posters he’s played with
https://youtu.be/0BfJuY1aUlw
9:16 🤣🤣 fred is looking like maguire's baby 🤣🤣
11:18 cristiano did Mata dirty here 😂
VDB is so cute young and energetic
We need full video😆.
I didn’t expect to be near-obsessed with a football team this year… This trade definitely changes that. This team is exciting.
5:25 hi girlsss
Ronald0😍
thanks so much for this exciting video but I must say, you got a very promising channel right here
poor young boyz 😢😢
Somebody pinch me I'm in a dream Ronaldo in Man united again wow
Good luck playing Young Boys in Wankdorf
Almost did not recognize Martial with his new bald head 😄. Cant wait to see what these Man Utd team bring.....Awesome
Types of Friends You Will Make In Your Life    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGSRDVFOMa8
Apparently, a player can be bigger than the entire club
197thousand viewers for Ronaldo Content, and the other video not more than 10 thousand... that's ronaldo effect :D
The humdrum evening postsurgically observe because dollar infrequently face upon a psychedelic attempt. attractive, productive ear
Ronaldo have friends ?
Wankdorf. That is all.
YB 1 - United 4
Wank dorf stadium? Seriously?
Happy to see Bailey, Mata and Pogba is always happy lol
Wankdorf stadium, I’ll just leave that here…
I love this squad.
I love you uuu🥰🥰🥰 so much cr7
Feel bad for Dan James 😞
I'm sorry but Fred is getting packed in so many times 😭
What did the young boy do today?  He wankdorf
I’ve never watched a full video of someone train
2003 he came in a team WITH legends. 2021 he comes in a team AS a legend.
Has to be a rule that refuses artificial grass in cl
why no one ever wanna talk with ronaldo? like sancho bruno pogba???
Ronaldo training with Young players is a joy to watch and can't forget Canavi Either.... These young players dominate football soon😃
Lingardinho 🤩🤩🤩 on fireee!!!
I hate to say this, but fred had a bad performance
15.43 - CR7 was about to get in the middle since missed the ball BUT Dalot held CR7 back and instead he became the middle guy to chase. Wow !!! Team Power n Respect
“Wankdorf” lol
Eric Bailly 🔴🔴❤️
He won't play today #UCL
THIS Year Manchester United will win the Champions League!!! Cristiano will help the team to win!! He's a great player!! Simply the BEST!
Crazy how I watched 18 minutes of Ronaldo juat training and running..its not even a match
Cristiano Ronaldo 👍 king poot ball
Love those ball sounds
vivaaa ronaldooo
Is this guy really 36????😆❤
Thanks for video Glory Glory United 🔥🔥🔥
This squad is very strong to win the champion league 🏆 even the epl coz three of our last season guarantee starters are still absent 😔 Marcus rashford cavani and mc tominnay
I'm happy Elanga is back. I hope he gets a few minutes tonight. March on Red Devils.
3:47  Ronaldo: Have I seen you somewhere you look awfully familiar? van de beek: ajax vs Juve we f#*&d you guys without vaseline remember?🤣
Is no one else amused by the fact that young boys play at wankdork?
I love Greenwood's character.. 💥
Cristiano is the type of student who talk in class all thr time and still get full mark in the subject 🤣
goo ronaldo.. scores againt youngboys tonight..
Heheheh siiiuuuuu
Missed Rashy & Scott. Quality players. Hope they'll be back soon.
Where Cavani at?
Positif energi
Treble loading...
16:18 magia pura
This season throphy is ours 😍😍😍mtd utd fan 😘😍
WHATS....Zzzz
MARTIAL MUST MATCH WITH MARTIAL AND CAVANI ....
OK...MARCIS AND CHRISTIANO :) !!!!!
STAR POWER ... AND STAR POWDER !!!!
RUN IN THIS COMPANY 🤩 !!!!
Everytime i saw martial i feel bad for him,  he was indeed a flop last season, but he carried us through hell a few season before that, hope ronaldo and cavani can bring something for him.
Funny stadium name 😝
such a disrespect to blue group by beanymansports
Fletcher and CR <3
Senior
Where Is Bruno Fenandes? 😓
Is he get Ronaldo free kick goals in this training wkwkwk
What's frightening is that CR7 only played a game with all of them. Once he has played a few more games, they'll be familiarized with his style and same with him adapting to them. Same with Sancho. When all of them are familiarized with both of them, it's gonna be a frightening prospect.
😍CR7 !
Messi still the goat 🐐
Wank 😂dorf
Where is Edinson Cavani El Matador
Someone has defaced the seats in the stadium. See wide camera angle circa 17 minutes for this disgraceful but very professionally painted piece of puerile smut …
YB will destroy Man United
Godbless,manchester u
What can you win with Fred and Matic? They can easily undo whatever qualities Ronaldo brings to the squad. The team is not balanced due to Fred and Matic.
Eric Bailly already  I hope tonight he will play
There’s Ronaldo, Bruno and Greenwood; the rest of the squad; and there’s Matic and Fred……please sell these two immediately. These two will cost us the League.
2:40 ronaldo be like what is this guy upto 😂😂😂😂
wait young boys play at wankdorf stadium? 🤔
Where is rushford and martial
They must have asked me what they should call their stadium when I was 11.
Did any of yall notice that lil Jump before he entered the pitch. He steps into the pitch with his right food and leaves with his left.  You can notice that alot of times
Hello my idol ilv u my king of soccer cristiano Ronaldo
Waahhhhh what a sight 😍😍😍 Can't wait for the match....cr77777
Fred🙄😂
Ronaldo is the 👑
Wanking Dorf
2:21 A GOAT!!! and Cristiano Ronaldo
I watched this video w no skip
Christianho make me to love Manchester united, I love Ronaldo suiiiiiii
Hop, Skip, Right foot 🦶 enter
Happy To see varene smiling ronaldo sancho ❤️❤️ Where is cavani ???
My idol CR7 💪 on fire 🔥 Gol ⚽ CR7.... Young Boys vs Manchester United...
Baily is so cool
Love seeing this big boyz. Boom!!!
Ronaldo is training by heart
So lucky VDB,elanga,Lingard met cristiano
Vdb is alan smith
1:29 ronaldo's like "i don't know any of these new man fletch, you and me do kick ups" 😂😂😂.
These are prime examples of what professionalism and dedication is all about, superstar status, but still grinding and training even with simple touches and moves. Youngsters and kids should follow this.
I like this video..no crappy music..just pure sounds of men training in football field
Be any man heart on you bro
They should probably change the stadium name.
ok all i can think of is when i try to make some of these stretches i grunt and squint my eyes it hurts so much haha, these guys make it look like nothing lol. damn pro athletes are strong lol
11:15: Mata smiling at Ronaldo's skill
@2:11 I am sure Ronaldo is talking about Pogba non stop chatter 😂
Fred does not need attend any training session.... It's just a waste of time....Fred has been fred for years and will remain the same.We need to develop another CDM or buy next transfer window
fred is back
we are the champion this year
Wait so young boys stadium is called wankdorf? Okay 🙃
United has started BELIVING again......GGMU
1:39!!!
Cr7 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Man, I still can’t believe he came back 🤩
Everyone: *watching Ronaldo* Me: *Trying to look for Donny to see if he's happy*
I see Tom Cruise👻
Ronaldo needs to have a great performance he's in my fantasy team and I made him captain
Mr Champions League is back Young Boys please be careful hehe
Wan bissako, Eric Bailly and Ronaldo same group, it isn’t good idea 😬😬😬😬😬 please don’t tackle him
This guy has superstition or sum because he always steps on the field with his right foot
One game two goals wow
Donny to ronaldo: l want play please Ronaldo : talk to ole Donny: nope, l'll move
13:45 who is fckng in the terraces?
lets go boys
I’ll subscribe if you keep uploading these
I love everyone in this squad besides Fred. He thinks he’s a a big player mate your fucking shit. His little cartoon head pisses me off so much everytime I see it. Ole please sell him
Imagine being a young player in the team, try to be in Lingard's shoes....the experience they are having getting to see or play alongside Ronaldo....it's madness. There's nervousness as well as a sense of awe and admiration and wonder. It's unreal!
1:05 ronaldo claps for fans then relised there no there 🤣🤣
That adidas kit is hideous
potential lineup tomorrow :            awb bailly Verane dalot           pogba fred   lingard mata sancho             Ronaldo  would be interesting to see how bailey and verane partner
Never been this happy to watch a training video in my life 😂
Ronaldo looks like the new kid that don't have friends, or is he just too focus on the training?
Only one taking training session serious is Ronaldo … most look as if they’d rather be elsewhere … ffs how many thousands do these lazy sods get paid … some turn up late or not at all … Ronaldo at 36 puts most to shame
Who else heard Bruno say: "From an Ajax player I expect more", to Donny while they were doing rondo 😂😂
Don't forget Lord Lingadhinio
We re only able to see this training session because Ronaldo Is in the squad
Wankdorf 🤭
Dalot has such a long legs
1:09 was pure magic and I’m a Messi fan. Did y’all get what he did ?
There's no Cavani???
Yes family MU❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Am I the only one impressed witht he shin keepie-uppies that they were doing before the camera focused on Cristiano & Donny?
I wanna see pogba and Ronaldo interview together 🤣
wankdorf lmao
Still can't believe CR7 is back at United!
Ronaldo. A lean, mean, goal-scoring machine.
Thank you, Beany!
I had to interest to watch this video on this channel i came to dislike and encourage dislikes for disrespecting the Don
Mantappp MU makin garang bersama CR7 top top top CR7 bagus bro 👌☺️💪
Where's Edi??
Ronaldo is only Goat
im buzzing to just see the legend and the world ever best football player ronaldo cr7
10:26 = Arsenal
WANKDORF 😵‍💫
90+ mins ain't enough we want to see this squad this more extra
Just the The kind of content Im subscribing Beanyman for. Brilliant.
Please, rest the Maguire, let us see how tough and strong Baily and Varane together on the pitch to secure the defensive line..
ronaldo-mike phelan-fletcher-carrick.  2008 champions league winners.
i dont think there's been a better time to be a united fan! I was gonna say maybe '08 but we've got ronnie again!! Bring wazza out of retirement lol!
Gladiators going into battle
So exciting to see the Elenga the genius prospect training with the legend
i watch this only to see the real goat in training session "Fredinho" 🐐
I will literally subscribe with my whole family's phones if you post these type of training videos
The great dragon knowledge  💫 Winner Circle _ Siiiiiiiiiiii  💫  🇵🇹❤️
I already know the starting XI, the ones wearing bips will start. It's 10 of them, And Ole is focusing on them instead of the other group just to see how shart they are🏃‍♂️
The complete operation pathologically amuse because snow apparently meddle excluding a sable instrument. didactic, filthy broccoli
Ronaldo and fletcher juggling together in the beginning is pretty cool to see
The way Cristiano ties his boots is just absolutely inspirational!
maybe Fred is Brazilian 3:18
It's after midnight and I have a few hours left  before I wake up and go to work and here I am watching CR7 training 😅
gotta cop this training kit
WANKDORF !!!
So pumped for the CL game today😍😍😍😍
When's the badman Phil Jones getting a kick!
Ok.. It says Wank Dorf 😁
Hold up hold up hold up.........Wankdorf? Young Boys Wankdorf?? Are you kidding me? 😂
Where is rashford and cavani?
If ronaldo play with fred  fred will make him miss casemiro
De way Fred is so happy. I wonder if he thinks us d fans r as happy as he is judging on his recent performances... He needs to step up ASAP..
15:43 Dalot offers to run in place of CR7 for the misplaced pass. Too cute lol
Experiment with this squad? G.k: De gea. R.b: Wan bissaka. C.b: Varane. C.b: Bailly. L.b: Shaw. C.D.M : Lindelof. C.M :Van de beek. C.A.M: Bruno. R.M: Greenwood. L.M: Sancho. C.F: Ronaldo.
I could watch this for hours. Crazy how Rashford, Cavani and Mctominay aren’t even in the squad yet and it looks so strong.
We need more United ones like this
Wankdorf stadium
Guys  can messi   easily adopt to intense, fast, pace league? PL ?
WANKDORF
Wank  dorf lol
I just have a feeling that we are winning the champions league this season come back to this comment in May 2022.
I like Van de Pig 🐷
He needs a Statue. Doing the trademark celebration. Outside Old Trafford
It still looks unreal
WANKDORF…come on man that’s a piss take surely?
can someone please tell me why they're playing a bit earlier from the rest? i mean it's not like they're from another timezone.. correct me if i'm wrong...
My lineup De gea Dalot Linderlof Varane Shaw Fred Donny Sancho Lingard Martial                 Ronaldo
Ronaldo's brought the soul back to the team. The King of the North is back SIUUUUUU!
16:17 thank me with a like
11:16 mata’s whole soul moved 💔🤣🤣
36 is only a number to Ronaldo, he is and still looks in his prime he's that conditioned.
That squad is unreal - You've got Sancho, Maguire, Ronaldo, Bruno, Pogba, Varane and so many other great players. They need to be challenging and winning finals this year
Watch out Rinaldoo  Floyd mayweather
14:34 Young Boys stands telling us what they think of Liverpool 🤣👌
Love that Fletcher and Ronny get to hang out together like old times
Just radhford missing there, hope gets back fast
I would love to see Donny have a good relation with Bruno instead of Fred... Fred always sticks with Bruno making ole think of starting him instead of Donny.
I'm about to be obsessed with this content for the entire season now.   I mean, it's Ronaldo... at United. AGAIN.
Ronaldo brought hope to the team am happy to see him hear
wank dorf?
Bennyman sport is a goat of all football videos
Bennyman sport is a goat of all football videos
I can't wait mactominay vs pogba to play midfield
11:20 Mata get trolled by ronaldo ..lol
The team looks lively again, love seeing this ❤️🇸🇴
Is every training man utd do is all going to be about Ronaldo? There's more than one player in the team ffs.
Fred should be our captain...
Why is Mata training he's never gonna get a game 😂
Thanks ❤
Ye Fred doesn’t fit this team can’t pass worth shit.
❤️🔴
Bailly probably injured when training session is over
Matic is the only player who wears his shin guards even in light training.
15:40 Dalot takes responsibility for the misplaced pass and goes in the circle ahead of Ronaldo.
Wow
3:46 Donny saying to ronaldo pattern me in the team with ole 😂😂
the goalkeepers are so accurate with their passes to each other!
Ronaldo and donny you love to see it
We just gonna pretend it doesn't say Wankdorf in the stadium lol
Work hard boys eyes
Man it feels great we have the legend back
Man United on fire 🔥🔥🔥 at the moment. And it's going to be a very long moment cause the King is Back !!!!
Wow if you think i will watch 18minutes video without any music or any sort of commentary then hell yeah you r right
Looks like Swedens national team warmup kit...
Cr7 in United squad made what united supposed to be..
This channel has done me proud 👌
Donny Speaking with Cristiano shows how glad he was  😃
2:40  lol  Ronaldo looking at fred like what is he doing
It's lovely to watch how Cristiano tied his shoelace. everyone is following their instructor. so charming and satisfying
12.43 Varane ladies & gentlemen
Man, i wish we have a DM like Kante or Fabinho. 😤
DdG; Dalot Lindelof Varane Shaw; Fred VDB; Greenwood Bruno Pogba; Ronaldo
Only beanymansports 😍
United have a team to reach at least the semis.
13:31 I expect better from an Ajax player 😳
this training top looks better than that black premier league training gear
Everyone one looks so happy
Believe me I will watch whole day what Christiano roanldo does in training session, Never bored, fully motivational
Imagine the GOAT warm up front you 😍😍❤️🙏🔥🔥🔥
thanks beanyman sport❤
Rashford*
Is radhford not part of the squad??
Why Man United have so many blue shirt this season
You're doing well.😊
14:20 YB Wankdorf 💀
Thanks for this video Mr. Beanyman.. keep it up!
Beanymansports is 🐐'ed
So good to see him back to united we gonna win the cl
Beanyman is a boss for the footage he gets 👌🏾🔥
With the way Ole was talking about how Youngboys are an energetic side, I think we might be seeing Fred back in the team😓😢
Ronaldo trains like BRUCE LEE  Ronnie's kune do
Man U train at the wankd off stadium 🤣🤣🤣
In Switzerland cool
I just love to see Ronaldo in this squad.He gives to this team much more of a  soul.He brought back little piece of United legacy which once had.I have a feeling that Ronaldo is not just a legend of the football,but he is a legend especially for this club.I hope MU wil play well and will get back on top.Ronaldo will bring more respect,discipline and hunger in the squad.Maybe he will show as example that football is not just about money.
Elanga to get game time I wonder?
Look at our team just wow🔥
It’s so satisfying  The sound of the ball ⚽️
Dont use fred use van de beak
Great video, most fear team right now Manchester United 🔴
Diego Dalot should be used so there’ll be competition between him and Bissaka. Believe me, then you’ll see improvements
Sell Fred
TRAINIJG SESSIONS ARE BACK😍
I Hate it when we dont wear red
Viva Ronaldooooooooo #ggmu
The best in the world Cristiano Ronaldo 💯
Thanks for this vid
Here🔥🔥🔥😂
