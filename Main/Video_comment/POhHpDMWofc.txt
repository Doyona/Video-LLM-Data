I live in the freaking USA sister. I was born race in the USA OK
I’m not doing anything like that because I have a disability in my family takes care of me and I don’t drive. I’m not a nail tech I wish but good luck with that cause that doesn’t make my public service. I done public service most of my life and I’m just trying to help keep a lookout for people who still are. I’m not one of them. I don’t use social media anymore like Instagram Facebook all that I don’t even have a camera OK and there’s nothing wrong with wine to work hard to make a profit you know but if you’re gonna have other people work for you, you need to give them health insurance so you need to pay them Because they have families too. All I do is talk about how cool certain nail polish brands are like mangy and you guys that’s all I do but I don’t buy it. I don’t I can’t buy it. I have only so much and I love your channel. I love your collection. It’s beautiful. You do a really good job. You and Susie do a really good job. I think it’s disgusting That the law wants to tries to people like you which is I don’t understand but my little sister is a DO in family medicine.

Out of all the things i have seen here playing nail-related content from yt on tv is ok. And maybe thumbnails if they can recreate the look might be ok if they somehow tag the og artist
i just noticed her old ass earbuds
THESE PPL ARE MESSING WITH THE WRONG YOUTUBER😂 SHE LITERALLY WORKS FOR THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT 🤣🤣🤣💀
Bro I work in a law firm now and I remember when this video came out so now my brain is just sitting here like brooooooooooo yesssss
This is why a salon CANT do a design they post claiming it to be THEIRS…. It’s a huge flag 😂
Im rican and we definitely use gringo/gringa for white people. That last statement you made about that being the hottest trend amongst white people is correct
I think by fever they meant trend like the hottest trend around?
6:26 THE FACT THAT AN AD CALLED YOU A GRINGA
Am I crazy or is 0:00 Neopet’s Key Quest in-game theme song but slowed down 😭
Used Beyyn's face too!
Sorry this happened to you!
As an artist myself MAN Its frustrating when people steal your own work and profit of it. My art has been stolen so many times that I rlly don't know what to do 😔

Wait you srs?! I havent watched your videos in a LONG time so i didnt rmb your exact videos or pictures, every time i see these products i go "OH like simply nailogicals's video!" i didnt know they were literally a copy paste wtff. I thought they had the decency to atleast attempt to recreate the nails 🤢🤢
The fact that a Shania Twain song is in this is so Canadian
4:30 I SWEAR TO THE HOLO GODS THIS WAS WRITTEN BY TROOM TROOM UNDERCOVER‼️‼️
Gringa is often meant a derogatory term from some people. Other then that that's a drag to hear about your videos being stolen, how are you going to make the thieves stop?!
Need an update on this lol still feel the same?
Omg please haaaalp am I talking to manny
The new trend for gringas 😂😂😂😂
There should be laws protecting content internationally!! Of all the laws we do have this seems like a no brainer
I just seen a channel about nails called simply not logical.😮
No, Gringo comes from "Green Go" (has nothing to do with tortillas). We (in LATAM) call Gringos or Gringas to those living in the United States, (I don't know if Canada is also in that pack). Gringo (at least to my knowledge of history and all the invasions and everything that the US has done to maaany countries in LATAM) comes from the Mexican wars and how the US soldiers were wearing Green so: "Green Go" is either because they want them to go as in "Green Go" or cuz they intercepted some signal hearing "Green Go" as in the whatever military thing that is.   And I know this is an old video but the publicity is in Portuguese (it even says that it's from Brazil) also I love your content, jeje 👅
Wouldn't things like this risk suing the company. Christine have copyright put onto this content to prevent more horrendous content that you ALREADY, as the "original creator" put out there!!!!!!!
i just yesterday saw someone try to steal her business holo toco
6:19 it's Portuguese
The fact that they used bens nails was the most shocking to me
I have seen many now have watermarks on the whole screen
I thought this might be one of those videos of people complaining about other people using their designs without credit, like the concept of a certain design belongs to them or something, but no, they literally stole YOUR photos and videos, you can get legal compensation for that.  If they don't have the skills or money to get someone to recreate the design and take their own photos, then maybe they shouldn't be doing business. Sue the hell out of them.
you might have to start putting your watermark near your nails and face to where its impossible to cut it out unless they cut out part of your nails/face.......
this what happens to Zayn Malik in India in hair salons
I watch this one scary story teller and this other youtuber was in my feed and it was word for word from mrbellan.
I love how Cristine was all funny and goofy until she saw Ben's picture in on of the stolen videos. She immedietly switched into I'LL SUE YOU!!! mode. Adorable
Slay
I wish the copyright laws meant they couldn't even show the ad in the countries where it's copyrighted. Like ya you can't do anything cuz they're overseas but they're showing ads to ppl in the countries where you hold the copyright T-T
6:17 as a native spanish speaker i can't read it either cuz it ain't spanish 😭💀😂
6:17 That is not spanish ma am
I would honestly buy a "paint thy nails / in holo we trust" tshirt
The companies are in big trouble!!😜😝
This is so wrong on so many levels. It’s one thing to shout business women/man that are nail technicians an beginner nail lovers out to spread the support and love, but it’s completely another story stealing completely branding something as your own when it’s not downright illegal! Its  morally ethically wrong!! That’s why everybody has to put a big huge water stain or marking on their videos, short clips or photos because souls and people like this that steal brand things as their own. It’s a whole new level or twisted and wrong and they know it! That the people advertise products like it’s their own, or still ideas and make them as her own along with, including many more moral and wrong in legal things people do they will downright claim their products or clean. Their products are brand that shares it’s disgusting and a little and wrong. Support in the right legal and caring way. It’s just rare and just doesn’t happen anymore when it does it’s very few in in between it’s just downright sad. I would be so incredibly upset side myself, because like put yourself in the shoes of those that worked so hard to build their business and then find out people or branding it as their own or using that for illegal and non-good purposes for their own profit an gain it’s downright disgusting. No one should have to put big watermarks all over the videos and stuff to prevent this from happening they would want to see the product shown clearly, the customers can know what they’re buying, but which is downright despicable these liars, and those that are making profit off your hard work. It’s just heartbreaking and wrong, we shouldn’t have to put watermarks on our own stuff due to people and companies that do this further on profit and gain illegal downright wrong way
I know this video is old but the post from 7:36 is from my country, they were talking about the new nail painting robot technology
They even stole Ben!! Seriously, this shit really needs to stop!
the one thing i do is whenever i post my art online, i put the watermark where it wouldnt look ugly but also in a place where you cant crop it, for videos im guessing somewhere in the middle? Like sort of transparent
Wow. That is legit bullshit! Cowardly, even. Only a coward picks people who can't fight back. I had mirror chrome back in the 90s. Thanks Sally Beauty.
That language wasn't Spanish, it was Portuguese :) That video it was from Brazil
Content court: unethical beauty companies
9:51 That’s what happened
SUE. You’ll be rich 🤑
Please don’t buy their crap. We know your great products
This is why I put my watermark in the middle, bc otherwise people just delete it 🙃🙃🙃🙃
The companies shitting themselves in the closet watching your vids to get more of your content for advertising: OH NO..
I don't agree with the fact that someone would use your content to make their own little bit of cash because they want to be cheap instead of doing the work themselves. It's almost like plagiarism. So if you totally could go after them and get the money they owe for pretty much selling your fingers as advertisement, would you? I totally think you should because YouTube pays you when someone watches the ads, views of the videos, and your subscriber amount. It's unfair for someone to profit off of your videos and you not even know about it until now.
Not me getting mad at Christine for saying portuguese is Spanish
I also love that the dip powder video thumbnail (printed as a poster to advertise that service) has a question mark. Seems like the salon doesn’t know whether they’re offering it or not. “DIP POWDER NAILS?”
simply naillawyergical
I can read Spanish and when i was trying to read what it said, I swear I thought I was having a stroke cause it didn't make sense 😭
13:10 G
10:13 F
I can’t believe they have the audacity to do that.
Hi I am a big fan
I think the only acceptable people to steal christine’s feet picks is Roots for socks
How do i SIGN UP for simply jurylogical duty
Ok I have a feeling that for the salons that an employee just went onto google or Pinterest found the thumbnail and just printed it out not knowing where it’s from. Still not right but I feel that google and other search engines are at fault because that’s how a lot of content gets stolen.
All of these may seem like individually small thefts, but cumulatovely accross the whole internet I can imagine it adds up to billions of dollars in lost revenue or royalties.
That's Portuguese not Spanish 😂
Your teal mug matches your jacket
You should make a video where you go to the salon and say "Can you make my nails look like the poster"? Even the fingers match. The embarrassment would be real.
The salon that just has her videos playing on the TV, that seems okay? I mean if they're playing them from YouTube she's getting views and it is her content the way she presented it? Am I missing something?
#beans
You could sue them and get so much money
Just saying that is not spanish it is probably portugese
I watched u ages ago
Exhibit C at 7:28 is in Arabic; it says: "The latest nail beauty technology has reached 💅 and it is a printer that draws any pictures you have on your phone 📱❤️ on your nails in 35 seconds... exclusive and only found in Algeria." This part I'm 100 % about, the next part not so much because it's in a different dialect, so I guess it says click on the photo to go the official page to get it
It’s like the Johnny Depp and Amber heard case all over again because Cristine is Johnny and the commercial trolls are Amber heard.
New holo taco hammer??👀
It would be funny if you actually bought the products and see what they give you in return. lol probably some fake crome nail polish
Portuguese.. not spanish . *cries*
gringas ia an insult cristine lol
Who needs Amber's and Jonny's case, when we have this.
🥰
I’ve been watching you for years and even tho this is from a year ago you still look the same as when I first started watching you 😭 does she never age ????
7:11 No :)  Gringa or gringo just means someone from outside the country, it can be used in a mean way but normally is just a definition. Also that's Brazilian Portuguese, not Spanish
“i have no idea, what’s going on or what’s being written bc i can’t read spanish” isn’t spanish 😭
8:29 which ones? who are crazy about that? which "women" are you referring to?
how are you going to say you made that when that kind of nail polish has been out for years? Chrom mirrow nail polish came out in 2016 and im pretty sure you did not make it get over yourself and stop taking credit for somone elses stuff
Hmm let's see not your nails you didn't make them you didn't mix the polish you did none of the work so there for not yours.
GARANTA O SEU KIT COM FFETE GRÁTIS
My new top thing on my bucket list: Go to every nail salon possible and call any of them out that copy Cristine for copying and being dimwitted bitches
I appreciate you not naming the nail salons. They are often run by recent immigrants, and there are many countries that don't have or enforce copyright laws, so it could be an honest mistake, instead of an intentional act of theft. I know the law doesn't care about that difference, but I do. And while it's very obvious to me that the photos that come up in a Google Image search aren't free to use, I don't think that's so intuitive to people who didn't grow up on the Internet like I did.  Obviously, that's not an excuse for them to break the law, and if they keep using the image after someone tells them it's illegal that's really messed up. But I wouldn't want to see someone's small business get ruined, or their employees harassed, over a genuine mistake.
There's a nailshop near me that had YOUR NAILS on the wall... it was the multichrome picture that lots of people stole... i asked about it, the poster came in with the nail polish they buy.   So it's a substantial company and the photo is is being distributed by a media company.    So no one bully the salons, they don't realize and they're not stealing the pictures.
Even if someone was to crop the watermark out u would be able to most likely see its cropped and the. U have then there’s fans who can tell it’s u
That’s not Spanish
Gringa means white women. Gringo white man, gringos white people. I have only ever heard it referred to these, I guess you can all imagine what Negra, negro and  negros means. To be fair it is a form of endearment for some cultures, not meant to be disrespectful or judgmental, it’s used as a way to call someone honey or babe, in other ways it’s like calling a white person whitey, as a fun way to say, hey you. It’s not meant to be taken in a negative way. Tone and context can make a difference being used as a negative or positive way. I think people can usually tell if and when it’s meant to be offensive, If they use common sense. Puerto Rico doesn’t usually see color since everyone in your family can range in different skin tones. Both parents can be light skinned while their child can be born with dark skin or the other way around. Or you can have many children each with different skin tones. Because of our history of Spaniards, European , African, French and Scottish trying to take over the island at some given point in history. We are now a mixed race. So you never know what you are going to get but who cares, thank god it doesn’t matter. Unless you have issues.
Okay Hi not from Brazil or anything but Im visiting family in Mexico, Yes Gringas is a food but its also a way to just say this person is from a forgien country. Or from my experience sometimes if I dont understand something my cousin will quickly explain or say, "Es Gringa" (Shes A Gringa) or sometimes it is insulting but mosy times just to say this person is a forgiener. At least in my experience
I am Mexican and there just calling you white
when the american army invaded one of the islands of puerto rico, people called them green go because of their uniforms and that's where the word gringo comes from. That is why when an American is in a Latin American country they are known as gringos or gringas in case of being a woman
i'm disappointed but not surprised that a brazilian company stole from her :( #desculpacristine
Gringo(a): USA white trash (rough translation lol)  It's an insult used all across Latin America, both in Portuguese and Spanish. It is specifically for white people from the USA, usually used when they only know English, they aren't very cultured, and/or when they have blonde hair and blue eyes. Basically, when the person is very American, gringo is used to describe them.  Another use I've seen is when the person is latin or Hispanic, but they don't know Spanish and do more American than latin things. Obviously, the language or customs you follow don't determine how Hispanic you are in the slightest, but it's true that gringo is used in these cases.
Ich bin toll
hallloooo
I think that was #robertwelsh in the multi chrome ad. What the hell! What is wrong with these people?!
Honestly they probably didn’t know they were using your pictures they probably just looked up pictures of dip nails on the Internet
I understand that the brand is using your face without permission but it's FUCKING PORTUGUESE, for God's sake. I'm tired.
That opened my eyes, I need to get educated about how different languages are from each other. I mean the arabics and etc... because that was not spanish, that was portuguese, but then again I dont know how to differ other languages from different parts of the world lol
cristine what have you done to me
It’s not Spanish
you should go to worse rated nail salon and review the service, but thinking that it might risk your precious nail, hm, ignore this comment
I've seen people confused about the word "gringo" so here's a REALLY resumed explanation.   The word "gringo" comes from the Mexican soldiers from the past, and it was created in one of the fights with Americans for the Texas territory, the american soldiers used to say "green go" when they wanted the green soldiers to attack, and the mexican soldiers made fun of them by shouting "gringo" and also to distract them.  Even if it was created in mexico is a word commonly used in every Latino and Hispanic country and now gringo means a "white American" or "a person that is from an English speaking country" or a foreigner.  Edit. I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes, English isn't my first language
This was so brilliant, I love it!
AH HAGAGA BEN’S FACE IN THE VIDEO
It says Brasil  Her: i can't read spanish   The lack historical references 🤨
You'd expect that a nail salon can make its own pictures to put on their walls...
Das not Spanish… Portuguese?
Simply Court: In Holo We Trust
i love her with all of my heart but that “I can’t read spanish” hurt my heart as a brazilian person(other brazilians will understand this) and gringo/gringa can be used as derogatory term or not, I don’t use it that way but a lot of people do it.
As someone who's mom is Nicaraguan, being called a gringa is definitely NOT a compliment. It basically means an uneducated white person who usually can't pronounce Spanish or something like that... however, a lot of people use the term playfully (my dad is white and my mom calls him a gringo) so honestly it depends on the situation or tone of voice. I think in this case it was just used as a word for white woman but who knows lol
If only there were a way we could get one of those glitter exploding fake packages to all of these perpetrators… we could make the world a more just, holorific place.
As a latino myself we commonly use the word gringo to refer to people who are from the USA its not used for anyone else really but its not to offend anyone its just a slang.
At 6:08 its portugues (i think) and its said "A new fever among the womens now in brasil , the elongation can be made at home and promises long nails and last at least 20 days, grantees your own kit with free shipping an gets a free uv drying cabin" (sorry if its wrong im not to good with portugues
okay so i don’t know if you’ve worked with them but has holo taco ever asked to use your stuff? it’s very sketchy /j
6:02 CRISTINE ATE EM ANUNCIO NO BRASIL VEIO PARAR ADJDJWKDKSDKDK A GENTE TE AMA
gringo/gringo is indeed negative slang for a white (usually from the US) wandering around in Mexico and Central/South Americas. whomever said is was a taco... uhm, what? i can only imagine it was said to be that by somebody trying to placate a white US cit that got pissy about it.
Her omg🤓
👌🏻💯
Next thing you know they are gonna use you hair
Yes  Most of the time gring@ is used to insult americans or english speakers
And if they are here well thanks for the view🤣😂
as a spanish speaker i will clarify gringa gringo is slang for an english speaking white person its slightly derogatory idk what it means in Portuguese tho
YouTube thumbnails show up in google image searches and I've learned that people who are not in advertising think everything on Google is fair game to use for their own purposes.
Ben in the background 🤣🤣🤣
youtube hasn’t been putting you in my subscribed thing , or on my recently uploaded , or recommended and it sucks cause i haven’t seen your videos in almost a year and like youtube is sucky you are one of my favorites and they didn’t show you so i thought you stopped posting
Guilty
https://youtu.be/px2YhneIR6c in the thumbnail I recognized something
gringas just means foreign, usually north american or european women.  the video is talking about polygel nails being a hit
"I can't read spanish" dice jajajsjjajsajsjjasjsajasj  Tipo, yo sé que si no hablara español también los confundiría pero me da mucha gracia
6:21 that's Portuguese bro
It was portuguese, not spanish...
I can say confidentially never use Google translate cause it's never accurate
ok i know arabic and a read it and it says: Look at this new nail art we have one of the biggest salons in the world come and try out our new nail art
Omg I want that holo taco hammer! 💖💖💖
months later but... great video
Gurl the clip after the Spanish part is in Arabic and as I Arab I can read 4 u<3
Lol basically it says new fever amoung white females... lol it's in Portuguese but gringa in Spanish is kinda like calling a white person cracker.... idk if I should have said that or not,  just trying to be helpful and informative.
Do you like my Dog :D
Kkkkkkkkkk you traing to speak PORTUGUES and thinking is spanesh this post is from brazil
I love how the pictures on the poster at 12:26 are stolen from several different YouTuber nail artists🙄
Am I the only one that thinks that it would have been sooo much funnier if she used a meet tenderizer for the gable?
please make an orange creme polish for holo taco
Life without parole
No, of course we don't blame you for not knowing the difrence between Spanish and portuguese
"I don't speak spanish" The text: is in portuguese IT WAS TOO FUNNY SORRY
LMAO IM DYING AT CHRISTINE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT GRINGO MEANS. We call anyone who speaks english a gringo tbh
Your hair looks so good!
GOD IS GREAT ✝️
GOD IS GOOD✝️
GOD IS AMAZING ✝️
HALLELUJAH ✝️
PLEASE PRAY FOR MY SISTER AND THAT SHE HAS MORE FAITH IN GOD 👑✝️
JESUS SAVES

For 8 million subscribers Cristine should donate 8 inches of her hair
The Arabic text said that you recommended their nail printer machine that you never used what
Je parle francais aussi
In 6:20 thats portuguese hahahahaha they are saying that is a fever with foreign women and now sale here
Thats so weird. They used my friends face once at a fake story and the govermment of my country repost, i think is so fucked up
Try being watched and used for 4 years without consent I was inch away from being sectioned but ppl we'd making money laughing
I am now part of the jury I have subbed
Put transparent watermark in the middle of the vid
I unironically want to see you go to one of these salons that took your thumbnails (haha nails) and ask for them to recreate the art they stole lollll
I am latinamerican and yes, you are a gringa
Some translation from Portuguese (not Spanish lol):  The new fad among foreign women, now in Brazil. The polygel nail extension can be done at home and promises long and durable nails for up to 20 days. Guarantee your kit with free shipping and get a free UV curing unit.
The one in Arabic says: “ The latest of what nail technology has come to and it is a printer that prints any picture you have on your phone onto you fingernails in 35 seconds. Only and exclusive in Algeria. Click on the picture to go to the official page of this printer.”
Haters  They're jealous of you
6:20 that's portuguese, its says brazil and we speak portuguese
Okay, I’m 11 months late but still 🤡 that’s Brazilian Portuguese, and translates for “the hottest us/european trends, now in Brazil”. I really don’t know how to translate gringo/gringa to English, but I’ll explain the best I can: gringo is an outlander, someone who’s not Brazilian. This person can be from Latin America, Asia, Europe, anywhere. As long they’re not born in Brazil, they’re gringos. Is not always pejorative, but is often used as so.   Gringo: singular, masculine.  Gringos: plural, masculine.  Gringa: singular, feminine.  Gringas: plural, feminine.   But btw I love how Cristine pronounced it with a French accent, so chic 😂
gringa is how Spanish speakers say white girls
6:18-Cristine:I can't read Spanish. Me:Well, I can...but that's Portuguese😂It's ok tho, Cristine...I don't blame u😊The two languages are extremely similar. Anyway, I don't understand how these nail thieves sleep at night🙄
Okay, so about the one in portuguese (it's portuguese, not spanish lol) says "The new trend amongst gringas is now here in Brazil!" The term gringa, at least here in Brazil, is just a term used for female forgneirs and tourists, while the term for male forgneirs is 'gringo'. It's mainly used for people who come from North America or Europe. The term itself has no negative conotation, but it *can* be used as a mocking term depending on the context. On this ad, however, the word is not used with mean intents at all, it's just saying how the nail product shown is a big trend amongst North American women.
Oh wow
Off topic, but can we talk about how good Cristine's hair looks! 😌❤️
Aaaaaa
8:30 women*
thanks for the view XD never gets old
1:52 considering the length of your hair, they’d probably also try to sell a hair growth product 😂
Gringa (female) or Gringo (male) it's a PORTUGUESE slang for foreign. It just means your not from our country. It's not mean if it's used by itself, it only turns mean if there is a mean word going with it. Yes, we speak Portuguese in Brazil, not SPANISH! I love simply anyway
"Gringo" is a white person from the US jsjs
I love how Cristine literally said "I don't speak Spanish" at 6:17....miss gurl that's not Spanish 😂
They should be put in nail jail
just realized that on 7:33 they were just talking bout how cool that robot is
simply: I can't read Spanish  me, a Spanish speaker: well fuck, neither do I     To be clear, I think that's Portuguese?
7:30 translation from an arab: basically they were advertising the nail printer (not the one simply used in her video) and saying it's only available in Algeria
your hair looks good
😂😂😂
Make an appointment at 1 of those salons where they have your picture up and be like Hey I really do want those and go in all kind of incognito and then bust them
The bustling uganda possibly box because puma atypically bump without a six credit. lively, awesome trick
The new fever among gringas🤣
Salonks stonks
Little lesson simply gringa means (or how me and people I know use it) white people. Yup.
Portuguese speaker here: A nova febre entre as gringas= The new trend among American women.
6:05 that's Portuguese, not Spanish. Just saying...
Wow now I want to listen to Shania Twain
naildentitiy istg-
SIMPLY PRISONOLICAL.
Omg I just realised this was published on my birthday 😭🤚My 14th birthday, AND I DIDNT REALISE, the fact my 14th birthday was horrible but now I’m starting to think it’s ok
it's actually Portuguese ☠
If you or your family is in a video without consent you can sue them and it is the same thing with your trademark or logo .
Technically, if u have ur trademark on them u can sue them. But yeah.
Honestly there GUILTY!!! Get them out of here buckaroo =_= haha

9:18 ew my name is amaya and that scared me
Mi país mi país
Man Cristine is so pretty. I forgot until now
It doesn’t surprise me that the companies stealing are stealing from other companies stealing. Lol there is no loyalty among thieves
All the thumbs down are from the people who stole your content.
I love how she recognizes bens nails
Guilty and punishable by destruction. 💥
I hope everyone sees this
11:24 WAIT THATS MY CITY PLEASEE I MIGHT GO THERE
i hope all those companies had a nice sweet smell of a law suit. 🙏🏼✨😩☕️🫖
PLEASE GO TO ONE OF THOSE SALONS AND THEN BE LIKE THAT PICTURE OVER THERE THATS MEEEEE
Wow .. 😦
its sad especially when its nail product producers when they HAVE the nail products
too good
Us simply nailogical fans will recognize your fabulous nails anywhere. 😆
i tried to translate what it said "the new fever now in brazil polygel stretching can be done at home and it promises great and resistant nails for up to 20 days guarantee your kit with free shipping and get a free uv drying cabin"
Judge Christian has spoken
I’m glad you didn’t buy the products that are rip-offs. Like then you’re just supporting the bad behavior
If they can afford to print those thumbnails they can surely just use their own chrome or powders to recreate a look and use their own content!
Aren't these mostly the sketchy companies from China that change names often to sell the same stuff?
6:19 it’s not Spanish 😂😭 it’s Portuguese
2:15  tHatz WhAT sHe SaiD
watch some idiot be like “she’s not a real judge blah blah blah” stfu 😎
Love you but there's only 1 "r" in "familiar" and 2 in "photographer." Sorry...argh
🦅👀
“I can’t read Spanish” I relate because they really do look the same!🤣
Hi!!!!_
Horrible. Some of these probably never ship anything out and screw the people who paid them. My mom got something on Facebook, it never showed up on Paypal but was taken out of her account somehow, the thing shipped wasn't the chair she ordered... If we had money we would have tried to track them down and sue them. Do you research before ordering anywhere ppl!

the people using the thumbnails in their salons likely didn't mean to and had no idea, they probably just googled for images of those specific nails and printed them out
Gringo or gringa just means someone who is from an english-speaking country lol. Also, that video was from Brazil.
it's not spanish, It's portuguese Cristine
Gringa means white girls
The losers criticizing cristine for mistaking Spanish and Portuguese ruin this video ITS NOT THAT SERIOUS SIT TF DOWN
Actually this is very eye opening
6:06 it says “the new trend between gringas” they just took your video randomly just for put some credit on the product and probably don’t know who you are, still wrong tho  Oh, and it’s not spanish it’s portuguese
SUE THEM ALL XD
This pisses me off SO MUCH dshddavjvsjda
GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY
Get Justice
"a nova febre das gringas" O BERROOOOO QUE DEI
Sorry I unsubscribed then resubscribed to look at the color😭😭
These people will go to #simplyjailoligicail lol not my idea-
The video: Brasil the translate google: Portuguese Cristine: spanish   You just get a bunch of angry latins, Gringa
Ok so if troom troom uses her nails then is it ok?- bc she CLEARLY wants them to do that
Cristine: if i ever become a private investigator-  Me: SIMPLY P.I??!? iykyk-
"I can't read Spanish" IT'S PORTUGUESE CRISTINE!!! And "gringos" is a way to call USA citizens Sending love from Ururguay 🇺🇾❤
Gringa/gringo can either be a slang term for white people/ someone ignorant or can be an informal term for someone who is foreign
They used your face because your so well known in the nail biz! Your a trusted face in the beauty influencer world, they are corrupting your face lol 🤣
6:12 cristine that isnt spanish........... not you too.........
Hahahaha I died with the spanish comment 😂😂
"can't read spanish"just at the moment in the bottom of the video says brazil AJAJAJ somebody forgot to read the whole text
Cristine Go Off
Okay, but do you have any idea how enraged I was when she said "I cant speak spanish" when it was portuguese
You're worried about hurting their business??? They're not worried about stealing from you. Help us help you! Let us know who these businesses are.
As far as I know gringo and gringa are terms that latin people use for foreign or white people
Omg… my parents names are Christine & Ben lol
GUILTY!
your hair is LONG
6:36 im pretty sure thats sayin "a new fever among white people" (gringo is a word for white people)
The court has spoken... they are GUILTY!! Btw on the first foreign language video, its not Spanish, it’s portuguese, just cuz im Spanish and I don’t understand that 😅 loved the vid tho
A NOVA FEBRE ENTRE AS GRINGAS KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK brasil marcando presença
no one steals our mom U-U
The first comment about you nails being advertised at shops I was like The AUDACITY Ther is only one person that can possibly use that sentence Bestie is that you?
This sucks. I'm sorry they're stealing your content for money. I'm always scared someone will steal my art. I write my instagram and my initials on my art, but I put them in the corners so they would prob be easy to crop out. :(
I know this won't be seen but what about the water mark in the middle of the screen
when you realixze that she didnt put a watermark in this video
Any updates on the domestic business doing u wrong?
THEY HAD A PICTURE OF BEYYYN 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Minute 6:40 says: "the new fever among the gringas (which is a disrespectful form of say "Americans")" they have no shame.... (sorry for my bad English haha)
The puzzled scooter dewailly share because goldfish notably behave between a amazing ostrich. cloudy, normal screen
u should go to the nail salon and tell them about the thumbnail
i think a good thing to do with your watermark next time is to put it in the middle of the screen cause companies and stuff will just crop it out. even tho it might looks irritating it's still worth it! and if they blur it out you can tell easily. (*great tip from a 12-yr-old hope it works*)
I checked out Amaya´s instagram and every single picture had comments that said "Stolen" we really are going after them :D
The second types of vids that's said gringas it was in Portuguese language from Brazil 🇧🇷
7:03 gringo it’s the word that we use one people or from the United States in their first language is English and don’t translate that video to Spanish because it’s not Spanish
6:10 that language is not Spanish
Your hair looks so good!
That’s not flippin Spanish
What do you companies pleed.  Companies: Not gu-    *GUILTY*
I just Happened to stumble across one of your videos and i cant stop watching them.❣️
You really are such a great person for the way you dealt w this...not calling them put by name and destroying their businesses? Anyone else would have!
thats not spanish  its portuguese t-t
I agree
u changed so much
SEND THEM TO SIMPLY JAILOGICAL (inspired comment not my idea plz don’t hate original comment by Alana Lynn L.)
I thought of a person just ripping out your nails
the things people do from money
Cristine: Alright I’m gonna stop banging this now   My dad: Hey that’s what I said when Isla was born!
2:35 if she becomes a private investigator, she would hire us to solve the case...... what the fudge??? What are you gonna do? Apply nailpolish??  . . . . . .   . . . Jk I would totally work for you. 😂😂 Love you ❤️❤️😘😘
We would have another rapunzle type situation with your hair?
"Gringas" would presumably be because your thing is "Holo Taco" ? xD
I think the dip powder nail photo is being sold by a poster company.
Wait, what if that multichrome makeup is causing your eye sensitivity?
Even if you don’t care about people stealing others’ content and using it to falsely promote a product, at least be concerned about whatever fake chemical product they’re trying to sell which won’t turn out anything like the real thing 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
You should just have a court on yt or tv called Simply Court and call them out!
Some literally get more profit by stealing pictures than the actual person who worked to take pictures.
you can't say that they stole ur design since you have no way to claim a design for nails... if they used clips of ur videos, sue the hell out of them
This is my first time on your channel, and at first I was like "Aww, small nail YouTuber"-Because I haven't heard of you before-"Better sub!" And then I scroll down and SEVEN MILLION SUBSCRIBERS! GIRL-DAAAAMN- You done did yourself right! ✨👏👏👏👏👑✨👌
I desperately want the sticker she put on her makeshift gavel!
Btw if u wanna translate Spanish using spanishdict or wordreference because gogletranslate is always wrong
the dip powder nails were also at a nail salon near me. theirs was used for so long the whole thing was color bleached
Guilty!
I think I’m angrier that they stole from Shania Twain. she deserves so much better than that.
I can’t stop picking my nails I’m NOT bitting them I pick them with my other nails can you help me?
You would think that if the salon had the money to order a sign made, they could afford to have promo pictures taken or take the pictures themselves because you know, they OWN a salon and have the resources!?  It just validates that if the salon is lazy with making a sign, they are lazy with their services.
"someone is stealing my identity."     Me: *wh- wha- you're a nail? What?*     *..... ohhhh waitt...*
Boo Hoo Hoo 😂 your so childish
Ding ding ding on the gringa lmao but that’s more Spaniard than Mexican lol
Messed up, I would hunt(hack) them down till i find them, haha you got internet girl use your skills!!!! Bam 💥
That is not spanish thought, it might be Portuguese
They had the audacity to include Ben
Gringa: from another country. Unrelated to skin color! Does not mean white girl 🤦🏼‍♀️
I can’t believe they blatantly stole your footage .
I once drew something for a foreign girl in my classroom, she was talking to her boyfriend on the phone. She asked me if I could draw his football-team logo. I did and I even coloured it in for her. She said 'thanks' and texted him a picture. Then she called him up again (this was during class, nobody cared haha) and talked to him in her native language. Sadly for her, she was quite integrated, so some words she said were Dutch, my language. During the conversation, she went; 'Yes babe, speakspeakspeakspeak ohh really? Speakspeakspeakspeakspeak aahhh great, yes, I love you too, speakspeakspeak, I made it especially for you speakspeakspeakspeak."  And I looked up and said; 'Excuse me?' And she went; 'Shit...I..wait..talk to you later honey, bye.' and then looked at me embarrassed and her friend hissed; 'You idiot...you said that out loud.'
cristine reading portuguese thinking its spanish saved my day. realmente gringa
BLAST the crap out of them.
I cant read Spanish     *literal portuguese*
Electric chair!
Spanish? 🤦🏽‍♀️
Here I am just making a list of your old videos to check out since I’m new to your channel. And also wondering what ended up being the best mirror chrome solution. I don’t know why but my entire nail art journey is centered around having nails that look like the liquid metal guy in Terminator 2.
people always to that especially to beauty gurus. I've always called them out but they just ignore me...
Exhibit B unfortunately stands for Brazilians, not spanish. Sorry spanish speaking people, but brazilians have given me so much shame and the opposite of patriotism that I wish it wasn't a Brazilian thing 😔😭 "fever" here translates to new trend, and "gringo/gringa" is just a slang for someone who's fron the US, no matter the race. MAAAAANY companies here use this "oh, look at what they're doing in the US, isn't it awesome? We have it too now, buy this (fakeass) product and you'll feel international and fancy" 🙄🙄🙄🙄 Look, I was born here, but I identify as an outsider. I am sorry, brazilians do this type of shit with everything, there are beauty salons who use celebrity posters on the walls as if that's what you're gonna get when you do you hair there, and other that even put celebrities faces on their flyers or logo..... things are wrong here, I tell ya.
I think that is Portuguese
Good job!
11:30 in lafayette, LA? i literally live there where the fuck is the shop I WILL GO OFF
who have Christine a hammer?...
I have a feeling that with the dip powder nails they just looked up dip powder nails on google for an image. A lot of times thumbnails will show up as images. Not excusing it just explaining why so many have shown up in salons as posters.
spANISH? cries in portuguese.. also gringa its not mean !
6:15 spanish my ass, this is brazilian portuguese. It literally says "Brasil".
Meeeee, as a brazilian girls, have to tell you that gringa just mean foreign girl. It says that is easy to apply and long lasting and you can order now with free shipping 😂
The second part is not spanish, is portuguese
HEY, PLEASE DONT CLICK ON LINKS THAT HAVE ¨BITLY....¨THAT´S WHAT PEOPLE USE TO HACK UR ACCOUNTS): ps: sorry for screaming at you los u byeeeee((:
I love how even though she's literally being stolen from and sadly can't do much, she still decides to have a good giggle with us 💖 I know I'd be fuming 🤬🤣🥰 that how you know she does it outta passion 💖 (we need a *Holo heart emoji* 🤩🤣)
6:18 its portuges
"Shaniya Twain's like-let's go... *to court* "  CRISTINE-PLZZZ
The way she thought that Portuguese was Spanish 😐
In Brazil we use the word “gringa” to describe someone that’s not from Brazil
“I can’t read Spanish” my heart is broken. It’s Portuguese!!!!!!!!
You lost my respect when you said "Spanish".
Turn to Jesus and be saved
Exhibit B is actually in Portuguese, not Spanish
"what is GrInGaS?" me: knowing it all because im from a latin country
You should totally go to these salons and ask for them to do the nails they stole from you until they recognize you :/
This was funny and mean I don’t now what to think mean about the Company’s
6:18 thats NOT spanish by the way thats Portuguese
THERE  IS A NOTHER YOUTUBERS THUMBNAIL IN THE BACKGROUND
Companies:**steals pictures of people** Us The judges:https://youtu.be/mVqjUzisfLo
get your own ben CLICK HERE NOW  im dying LMAOdfasffsd
6:18 i know that they are using your face (which is completely wrong btw), but please at least don’t call Portuguese as if it was Spanish, ok?  we’re tired of people calling it as another language that it’s not
I think it's better to put your watermark in the middle of the vid
Her nails are internationally famous
she saying that thats spanish when ist PORTUGUESE 😂😂😂
In Mexico a “gring@“ means a person who lives in the US. Or a quesadilla hehe but in this case I think it meant the first one 😂
I love the murmuring into the tea about everyone hating at least /some/ influencers 😆 Also Ben's picture being in those ads! Lol
Gringa is slang for white girl
One of the the scammers who stole your stuff watching this: 👁️👄👁️......well f*ck I'm doomed
The one in "Latin America"  is in Portuguese for Brazil, and I would be lying if I said I'm surprised 😂 I'm a Brazilian lawyer here and copyright violations are... well, SAVAGE here Hahaha I'LL DEFEND UR INTERESTS IN COURT, SIMPLYYY! CALL ME TO PROSECUTE THEM HERE IN BRAZIL 👀
im now realising that this was posted on my birthday
Its a shame because some of those products/nail shops are actually good! But its very wrong to steal. 💁
What happened to exhibit C?
God, these companies are so scum. These platforms need to screen their ads. How is that not already a thing?
7:32 I can read it but sadly cannot translate
well... didn’t expect that arabic post at 7:30
Well even thoe i have a watermark they copyrighted my video on miraculer 319
Perdi tudo na parte das gringas.... kkkkk
So gringas is actually a nearly offensive way to say American......I’m sorry Christine, let’s put them in simply jailogical.....
The title makes it sound like someone broke in and says 'gimme all your nails now 😤😤) Lmaoo
It was written Brasil :( we speak Portuguese
6:18 Eso no es español es portugués 😩
put them in simply jail logical
The second (I think?) is portuguese (brazilian portuguese), not spanish hsushshshsh gringa or gringo is like, anything foreign, so the ad is like "this is huge in other countries!"
I believe this may be illegal
cristine should try olive and june they have "holo"
in holo we trust
no Cristine, the sub button does not turn grey it turns Holo with bad lighting.
Ok so when a latino calls you gringa/gringo they are basically just calling you white or cracker 😐😂😂
Simply I have an idea put your watermark in the middle of the screen so they can crop it out and then when they try to fade it out it will look weird
Need to start putting your watermark like right in the middle of the video so they can’t crop it out!
Who the fuck cares? You already make money off of your content here and elsewhere. By using your pics they ALSO made some money using your content. It's not like they made money that you could've made. I haven't seen your videos is many years, still trying to be Jenna Marbles I see LOL now that's sad.
7:27 Algerian page on Christine's video 😂😂😂🇩🇿🇩🇿
Listening to tea being spilled while painting my nails and sipping my coffee.
Were it says "AMAYA" O ma GAWD it's Amaya Raine
What would u do if Troom troom emailed u to join them!? 😂😂😂😂 iT’s NoT a PrObLeM aNy MoRe 🥴
I'm a little offended by her saying "new hot trend among white girls", saying like there are no white people in latin america ... It's just me?
Cristine Nailogical Esquire

Yeah Gilte🙏
All the thumbnails come up on a google search. I doubt they even knew it was yours but still doesn’t make it okay
Me searching : the best nail artist  Google : gets Recommended Cristine's channel
That’s why you just put your watermark right over your face lol.
To us gringa(o) just means white girl and white boy sometimes it can be used rudely, but most often it’s just to play around
Late to the party but at 14:38 when she says she’ll sue over someone taking Ben, honestly the stick of butter that is my heart melted. That was so insanely sweet
Why did I laugh so hard at Ben asking if she was hammering something? 😂
Lol "spanish"

Hey Cristine! I'm a huge fan 💖 As a Brazilian Holosexual 💿 (and proud of it) I must say that we speak Portuguese.😂 And Gringa it's not offensive at all!! We use "gringa" and gringo" as a word to refer to any foreign person! Much love from Brazil 🇧🇷 Te amo ❤️❤️❤️
I can just imagine that one salon that took Simplynailogical’s thumbnail that have that very intricate design at 12:27 & someone just asking them   “Hey, can you do this design on my nails?”  **Points at the design on the thumb**   & if they say, “Sorry, we can’t do that one.”   My response: “But if you can’t do that design, why advertise it?”   & then we can watch them either squirm or suggest a different design because they probably know that they just screwed up right there.
The curvy cough preferentially strengthen because queen largely crush by a zippy slash. bewildered, racial sentence
Gringa does mean white girl lol
i once saw one of your videos playing at a children's play place
Even Ben's nails!!!!
The abrupt porcupine enthrallingly place because creature presumably kiss upon a one flight. tiny, spiteful sail
Your honor, we the jury find the defendant: GUILTY OF BEING TRASH.
I’m just now watching this video to find out it was posted on my birthday 😭
Teaaaaa
6:18 that's Portuguese
I went to get to get my nails done today and saw a wall full of YOUR thumbnails and I wanted to throw up. My mom didn’t see it cause we were across from each other and it was on her wall
Order..... ORDER!!!!  WE FIND THE DEFENDANT GUILTY
JUST PUT THE HOLO TACO LINK IN THE COMMENTS!!!
06:20 this is portuguese (brazilian portuguese, actually), not espanish LOL  the video is talking that its a hot trend between people from other country (in the brazilian view, other country), thats why they put your face on the video. i dont really know exactly what it its, but is a way to put acrilic nails by yourself, at home. i dont know, im sorry :( also sorry for the mistakes in this comment, i dont really know how to exactly write in english
And that's why I'm deleting all of my pictures  and videos with my face that I posted on the Internet.
sometimes, your captions are concerning
Unless it’s an ad for best fiends or tea it’s probably not consented 😂
I feel emptiness      The pain of being insulted. And not just me, but a lot of people.
The salon that stole short nail designs thumbnail also stole cute polish's panda thumbnail. Why do people do this, they stole multiple people's work.😡
12:13 *silence*
I love that her intro has tea in it 🤣
PUT THEM IN SIMPLY JAILOGICAL!!!!!!!!
ITS PORTUGUESE NOT SPANISH
The second ad was not Spanish, it was Portuguese 😭 (shame on Brazil for having those people that take someone’s face and nail)
I bet this has been said since i'm watching random shit at almost 4 am, but I'm pretty sure what happened with people printing out your youtube thumbnails is they just literally searched for "nail dip powder" or whatever other keywords like that and picked the first one that came up.
I love how she says ew gray when halo is sortta grey
Not me thinking her name is simply because her other vids said that her name was simply...😬😂
I love how you’re most offended at them stealing Ben’s image haha
Gringa means white girls
hi
I love how 14:35 that's shows ben and say get yours here....are they selling your personal tea boy or the nail product?
Don’t be shy comment on it🥳
Gringa/o just means foreigner that is not from Latin America.
ok but cristine is so unproblematic and just handles the situation in a entertaining way
"Gonna sell socks? need a feet oic? I dont think so." But....Simply..You are a sock..
I bet everyone who did liked this video are the companies she talked about
OMG Cristine, 6:06 its on portuguese, brazilians don't speak spanish HAHAHAHA
I miss you Cristine 👉🏼👈🏼💓💓💓💓
i'm arab so let me explain what it says at 7:28  "the latest technology just came for nail art and beauty" "it's a printer that draws any picture from ur phone to the nails in 35 seconds, specifically and only in Algeria"  "click on the photo and it will bring out the main page for this printer" or sm like that i can't understand the last line 😭😭
YouTube thumbnail, printed onto paper, photographed, put into a YouTube thumbnail. How deep it goes! XD
Love ur channel! 🤩🖤🥀
As a design student I have learned lots about trademark and copyright laws. These examples that you gave are completely and entirely copyright infringement, and there are serious penalties for it. When the courts get involved, the punishments are usually fines and discontinued use of stolen content, but in extreme cases jail time.
17:13 Ben saying "have fun!" like a parent who doesn't understand their kid's interests but is still supportive of them.
gringa also means white girl😭😭😭
the algerian ad sent me 😭
I can excuse stealing cristine but i draw the line at stealing ben
Wow simply your famous that’s why people use your face and nails
at 7:19, you didn’t change it to Spanish. It said that the detected language was Portuguese not Spanish.
they called you a white girl, simply. that’s what they meant by gringa
That wasn't spanish, that was portuguese
A lot of small salons (& small businesses in general) are run by out-of-touch old people who probably mean well but don't know any better and think any picture from google is free to use.
IT WASNT SPANISH IT WAS PORTUGUESE MISSY /nm 🤣🤣🤣🤣
It was Portuguese excuse me.
How have I not seen this video???
Christine looks so tanned in this 😂
You should put your water Mark in the middle or closer to the middle
Btw exhibit C is written in Arabic.
how have you not aged at all
You should ask if you can get it for free, since they used your pictures/videos to sell their items. 😂😂
wranglerstar
7:35 I speak Arabic and that post was actually talking about the nail printer, things like " Look how the modern technology becomes amazing, now you can print anything on your nails..."
Actually one of the companies stole not only your mirror chrome footage but also a small russian nail blogger footage too (@letsnailmoscow), on those  clips she wasnt even wearing nail polish it was like false nails
The arabic one actually isn’t an ad its just says look at this new trend of a bot basically printing nails on .
😩😩 nooo they calling her a gringa omgggg
Simply: “Misce-nail-eous... ugh...”  I laughed so hard from Cristine sighing at her own pun😅😅
While watching this i got an ad that literally said STOP USING NAIL POLISH Like what?
They are legit idiots for copying her
Is not spanish, is portuguese. They're trying to sell a polygel kit using your footage
I just wanna say that the poor......      Ad was in Portuguese 😭😭
I- Christine...there’s more someone stole your video like the second or third
it's been 2 or 3 years since i've watched cristine's videos and i'm glad she kept the same intro music
Pleeeeasse go to these salons!!!!!
It’s Portugues
The nail oil killed meeeee🤣🤣🤣
Watch out.... they’re coming for your hair next!! 💇🏽‍♀️
Tell bennnnnnnn that he was stolen to the picture of his face we used. stoppp stelling simplys suff.
Thats portuguess
"Brasil" You "I can't read Spanish" wtf 😂
I want that hammer
Imagine stealing thumbnails from a person that has more connections to the government then the average person...smh
12:03 I think thats not to bad, considering they left out the watermark and didn't try to claim it as theirs
all this energy put into making crap products and stealing stuff could easily be put into good work...it would be better for everyone
"a nova febre entre as gringas" brasileiro👉👉
Every brazilian cried when you said "spanish"
EU VIVI PRA VER A CRISTINE FALAR PORTUGUÊS AMÉM
Maybe the multi chrome face is why your eyes are having issues now.
Sucks how you can't sue just cus they are overseas. The internet may be vast and all but the laws to protect is so weak and small in comparison. Its no wonder why people think its no big deal to steal content/throw hate comments cus they will never face repercussions anyway🙄
OH MY GOD! I JUST SAW A AD USING YOUR NAILS JUST ON YOUR THIS VIDEO😭😭 I'M DED!
I bet all those dislikes are from the companies who stole them....
7:33  That language is Arabic  And I know some Arabic too !!
You should watermark the whole video lol so they stop stealing it
I would LOVE to see you go to a salon that has your content posted and say, can you make my nails exactly like how I DID THEM in MY photo? I would pay to see their reaction. 🤣🤦🏼‍♀️
You literally rasied me i’m never going to stop watching your videos😭
Just an helpful thought?¿ Print your self a custom made background/deskcover with your trademark on it instead of a simple black one.   It wont prevent them from steal your content but it sure will make much worse for them to edit out your trademark when it literaly says "SimplyNailogical©" in the Background everywhere.
Cristine: *Calling out businesses* Me in my bed eating a lunch able and drinking a Caprisun: ***Yes, call them out.***
Hold up. Do Buy it  Do a Charge back for Fraud Contact your bank  And Explain   This is stolen from my own site.   My salon * has okay photos but they are both clients and people who work there
You should do a  thumbnail tutorial podcast  Talk about the Stolen Thumbnails How you do them the trends you've seen amd love /Hate
Ewe why  That's my reply to soooooooo much in the world.

Wow...when you’ve been around long enough to remember when these videos came out.
I hope Christine takes the salons to court though or sends them like a don’t do this message lol
cristine is too nice. If I was her.......(I don't even wanna say more)
“The new hottest trend amongst white girls” man... this is a beautiful ad
that is no spanish im mexican  hola
Your so beautifull!:D
nail tutorials lol
Oof. These beeches. 🙄🙄
Wait this was months ago I thought it was like a few weeks
On Pinterest
I found other places that copy her
google translate: PORTUGUESE DETECTED Cristine: I don’t understand Spanish
The defendants? Who defends these guys? :P
As a former spanish speaker "gringa" can be mean if you take that way but it's a funny way to say non spanish speaker american girl and no not the doll
Wow. This definitely makes me not to trust online companies.
I know you’ll never see this week can you do a video painting your nails
Saves her self on the feet pics joke
Make money of them stealing your likeness
I also found MASKS 😷 that say WHERE’S MY TEA and the description is “Where'S My Tea - Simplynailogical Funny Print Reusable Pm2.5 Filter Face Mask Youtube Simply Simplynailogical Nailogical”
Not surprised these peeps stole your amazing content. I wish there was a way to stop them from doing that!! We just need to flood these ppls comment sections with SHAME!! 😉😎  I’m just excited to see that we have the same blue and black DAVIDsTEA tumbler!! Btw- you got me hooked on DAVIDsTEA 💕 🫖🫖☕️🍵🧉👍
A CRISTINE FALANDO PORTUGUÊS KKKKKKK
“They may steal my hair” I’m dead 😂‼️
I think she’d be great to hangout with the H3H3 Podcast-
Is it ironic that at 11:44 Cristine plays Chef John's Food Wishes theme? Idk if he owns that copyright or if it's public domain but it's the theme from pretty much every single video he's made.
Everyone's a critic
Christine, on 6:24 its not Spanish, its portuguese!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I mean if I saw Ben's nails as an advertisement I would immediately buy it
as you should
Simply got younger in 3 yrs!!
There’s something so satisfying about Cristine saying “Holo everyone it’s me cristine again”
Cristine is giving me "sassy Piper Halliwell" vibes here, not sure why but I like it
Multi Chrome Rain Drop! Beautiful!
Me and my best friend want to try your products very badly 🥺 but I'm from Mexico. When they going to be avaible here? We love your videos ✨
I mean all I can think of this video is Ace Attorney and Christine being the judge and screaming holo all the time
i find it hilarious that the entire video has no watermark
I’m from Costa Rica haha and Gringa is part of our lingo but that add was not in spanish it was in portuguese 🤣 gurl Cristine
7:33 ما نعرفه ما نعرفه🏃🏼‍♀️🏃🏼‍♀️
the advertisement in 6:09 is actually in portuguese UHDASUDHAUDAHHU it's definitely from brazil (i know my country calls foreigners "gringos")
Gringa is slang for white girl/women in Spanish (I am a native Spanish speaker)
I finished this video and then saw exibit b as a short video
It wasn't Spanish it was Portuguese tho😂
A lot of the tiktok accounts have been taken down 🥰
The subscribe button should turn holo
btw im puerto rican gringa is a racial slur for white girls and gringo is the male version
The puny beat acly impress because january hopefully snatch next a bouncy lead. snobbish, lively mosquito
Your hair looks beautiful
You obviously don't speak Spanish! That's not Spanish hahaha. It's Brazilian Portuguese. hehe still love u
The fact they called simply a gringa while she confused Portuguese and spanish is just so fucking funny to me
That is not spanish 😂 it's portuguese from Brazil. "Gringa" is not a mean way to call someone, it's just a different name to call a foreign person. We refer as gringa or gringo any person who don't live in brazil. Brazilian portuguese has a lot of slangs. It's hard for us to keep up sometimes. It is a difficult idiom
Christine! Thats not spanish lol it's portuguese! I speak spanish, i'm from Mexico and gringa is 2 things: the food it first showed you and a slang used for a english speaking female more specifically for US people but you can qualify as one, it can be mean but in the context it wasn't , it was trying to Say : look you can get the same fancy nails as gringas do! , Hope it helped xx
6:15 that's actually portuguese not spanish and um... Gringa is a term used for well... USA woman 😅 they couldn't even get your nationality right girl 😂😂🤦‍♀️
Jeffree Star SUED Wish for stealing his photos from his Jawbreaker palettes!!
The Arabic part at 7:31 says " the latest of the nail grooming technology wich is a printer  that would print any pictures on your phone on your nails in a matter of 35 seconds exclusive and only in Algeria" the Final line is hard to understand since am not Algerian and Arabic is not the same in every country .I think it said click on the main page or something like that
No Cristine, foot rubs and socks are not what feet pics are usually sold for...
Haha demoney
why dont you put the watermark in the middle?
That- cristine that's Portuguese
Who else thinks Cristine is so pretty with her hair down
i would subscribe again, if the button turned holo
Contact the companies, tell them you're a large platform influencer who would love to review their products to upload, it'd be exposure for them and all they had to do was send you the product in the mail (Free). :D No lies told, only facts and you'd still get to review them just like you promised you would. MAN!! I hope you see this comment because I'd love to see that level of awesomeness. LOL
Me having a channel and doing this😌
I'm so sorry that this happened but what I think is just as bad is if a person invents a new technique to do something w/nails and then a year or more goes by and then a BIG International Nail Company takes the same technique and says that THEY just invented it.Gimme a break...and not just once but TWICE. Unreal
one of your old videos just came up on my home page on youtube and the memories came back to me
She put a holo taco sticker on the hammer- I WANT A HOLO TACO STICKER
"I can't read spanish" it's says brasil RIGHT THERE lmaaaao come oooon
DO A CAT CLOCK COLLECTION VIDEO
The undesirable girl sadly flow because crocodile contrarily sprout through a salty trouble. determined, painstaking plant
Time to sue :D
But what did Ben say about his nails being stolen? He’s nail famous now 😂😂😂
Not Spanish, lol
Gringa is a word used to described a white person (feminine)  Its like a white person saying beaner ^^ But its not as mean as beaner so your welcome
kinda wondering if a sign shop / any kind of online image or ad provider??? is just ripping off your thumbnails and advertising it as stock???????
Argentina lol
Petition for the subscribe button to turn green after pressing. 🙋
The jury has spoken. We declare them GUILTY
Who else noticed..... No? Ok just look at her trashcan. Now you see it!
“I can’t read Spanish” Babe, That’s Brazilian :(
6:17 That would be portuguese,
Eu vi a "nova febre entre as gringas" ali no começoKKKKKKKKKKKK
I'm pretty sure when she moved on after the silver Chrome nail polish part it shows those pink nails and I swear I just watch the same clip
I used to work for a clinic that did some esthetician stuff and one of the owners did like skin tag, mole and dark spot removal. She was working with a marketing company to make a flyer or something. I remember overhearing the marketing guy asking if she had any client images she could send him for the before and after photos and she just told him to google for some. Luckily, he refused. It's just kind of bizarre 'cause this was a real clinic and she did have real clients, but I think the treatment (probs the dark spot removal) isn't as effective and she wanted to skirt around the truth with marketing. It's really shady and I'm so glad I'm gone from there. I try to support small local businesses but between that and all the other shitty things going on, I hope they went under since I left.
Simply nailogical:”I can’t read Spanish” Me:”That’s not in Spanish”
Gringa means white girl
Go to one of those salons!
Skin just glowing!
7:30 العرب إلي يتابعون: هلو 👁👄👁؟!
On minute 7:33 its selling the printer and saying that it is the latest device and you can use it from your phone and they used Christine picture just because she is holding it they don’t even mention her in the ad🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ I don’t know
Português
Make a nail salon please. I will work for free.
I'm very ashamed, my country (Brazil) is simply shit. about the word "gringa" we use it to refer to women (and "gringo" for men) who live in north america and europe, not just white and white. The "s" make the plural in word (Sorry for my bad inglish, i'm learning english watching english content, it's not as good as i wanted it to be LOL
And the Jury has decided that they are GUILTY!!
They shouldn't be doing that without your permission
u should write ur watermark on ur hands so it will be harder to edit out :)
Haven’t seen Cristine in forever.... she went from nailogical to LAWgical
You work so hard to be creative and companies should respect that
another thing that sellers do on instagram is use artist's drawings without their permission and not only is it wrong to steal art but also,, it doesn't make any sense to me? What does that drawing have to do with your product wth
I died when she said miscenaileous  Those nails are messing with her head
u should prob check wish . com prob like simply holo body pillow XD
6:30 that's not Spanish. That's Portuguese. WAY different.
Oh, no! My country using your face and nails, I'm Sorry 🤦🏾‍♀️  At least I got  to see you trying to speak portuguese 🤣  And yes, "the new fever" means "the hottest trend" hahahaha  About "gringos", basically everyone that doesn't live in Brazil is a "gringo"
Did she sue tho?
aNd yOu kNoW i hAve eNouGh
It’s probably really really late to say that but the intro looks so much sexier with the holo taco polishes
We all start out as assholes in the womb. Some of us don't grow out of that phase.
That random ass add calling her a basic white girl sosbsjbeoams
SUE THEM
I bet the holo polish some of them are selling isn't even real holo 😒
GIRL, YOU Really think they saw your thumbnail in a salon first off... secondly, you think it happened more than once?! hahah I cant. Where did reality go? Someone made that pic and lied to you!
I'd just like to say, for me it works to keep people away from your content more if you have a complicated (?) image with the watermark so that people will give up or make the clipping out obvious >:)) Shit still gets stolen tho-
you should buy those products and make video about them vs original product
I'm JuSt A sOcK!
Girl that’s not Spanish. That’s portugués.
Good thing the add was in Portuguese
I get this. About 10 years ago I had a nail blog and a post that blew up overnight. Now if you search nail sponge on ebay or wish you see my nails for every other picture. 🙈
I love how it's trendy to use your thumbnails 🤣
just vibing in 2021 rn
Ok this is real plagiarism and it is really not ok to commit plagiarism you are literally stealing other peoples hard work and saying that it’s yours without giving credit
14:35 I can't Lmao
its portuguese no spanishhh
8,660
Tha hamma at the start
the brazilian ad nooooo
It says “the new fever among gringas” jajajajaj, it’s Portuguese :v
Gringa means how latins or Mexicans call white girls in like slang or somethin like that
I also create non-face based content on IG and half the time when someone sends me “hey is this you? Someone stole your video without credit” i look at the video (which in fact is mine with a watermark) and I DONT RECOGNIZE MY OWN HANDS 😂 mine are pudgy and small and distinctive from other but STILL IM LIKE WHO DFQ hands IS THISSSSSS??? 😩😂 idk how u can tell your hands apart from others
that is not spanish, eso no es español
i bet i saw this HOJO brand too https://www.aliexpress.com/af/hojo.html?d=y&origin=n&SearchText=hojo&catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20210103032501
I really want for LegalEagle to react to this
ive seen nail artists put it on their nail
ITS NOT SPANISH   NAO É ESPANHOL CRISTINE!
0:17 ...excuse me?? Don’t lie
identity theft is the best form of flattery i guess... idk but thats not good.
The nail dip one seems extra weird in salons becuase it has a question mark like.. do you not know if you have nail dipping powders or not?
These thieves are just so LAZY!
you're not Simply Nailogical. You're                         Simply Courtlogical
This might be my favorite video from this channel lmao
In the thumbnail cristine looks so much like her sister 👁👄👁
Christine I have your snap and I message u
"That are not here today with us because,  THÀY ARÈ SCAERED!"
That wasn't spanish 😭
Christine"Wait it doesnt turn green it turns grey.....Eww why?"
GIRL A NAIL SOLON IN TOWN HAS YOUR THUMB NAIL ON THERE SHOP
Holo things she has not tried: Holo hair dye Holo eye contacts Holo bedsheets  Holo resin art Holo campfire lights  Holo bath Holo huge bath bomb  Holo wedding cake holo Food
Omg I just found u on my recommend and I missed you it’s been like 8 months
My extremely social puppy was listening in on my video and was looking around my room to try to find you because she thought you were in my room to play with her xD
I remember seeing some of these on facebook and explained to ppl in the comments that the pics werent even of the company's actual product and they were probably cheap knockoffs anyway
The hammer is not Holo😣
WAIT A NAIL OIL PEN?!?! I need this info.. do tell again... the real info this time lol
Wow😶
SPANISHHH JAJAJAJAJA
I actually saw your nails in a salon the other day
6:18 it's portuguese
The posters look to me like someone is selling them to these salons and beauty stores... Just mass printed 'em, and maybe have a shop online. The stores might not even know it's yours.
Where’s Ben?
Imagine some company using cristine's naked nails as the before picture for some anti yellow nail products lol
1. that's portuguese, not spanish 2. gringa is not a derogatory word, is literally just how we refere to internacional people or even other countries.
I have seen Threadbanger thumbnail printed for a banner at a carnival for glowing cotton candy. The cotton candy was also overpriced!
You look like Jen in this video. Weird
I think in one of simply’s wish videos there is one for blood nail vinyls
6:15 that's a brazilian add. it's not spanish, it's portuguese. but you speaking portuguese is the cuttest thing in the world! <3
7:22 yes. It means the new hottest trend for English speakers
I was watching this video all serious and listening and understanding...untill Bens face popped up in a picture, used in a fake add. It made me laugh so hard I got tears 😂😂😂
This Instagram page which called "entre nous official" they were writing in Arabic and this is the translation: "The last thing the technology come up with to make your nails beautiful is a printer that can draw on your nails any picture you have on your phone with 35 seconds.. Exclusive and just in Algeria" That's funny!!
They can’t crop out your watermark if it goes across the video diagonally!
In the end, isn’t nail identity theft one of the most sincere forms of flattery?
Wouldn’t it be ironic for this video to be copyrighted?
I think they're just searching key nail art words on Google images, cause youtube thumbnails come up there all the time
Cristine: "I can't read spanish"  Me: Cristine, pls gurl... Put attention, that's portuguese sweetheart. Hahaha
....i was going to translate the spanish but um THATS NOT SPANISH lol
I love the diffrent polish on different hand look you've done that effortlessly cristine the trend setter
Honestly the most infuriating part is that they don't even try to edit out the watermark, or do it badly.
The gringa part 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
And why tho they take the worst image ever I mean this liquid miror going on your skin makes me cringe so much my gosh
:)
You should make a video where you order polishes from these companies to see what it's like 😂😂
Thank you
Not only are they stealing they’re pretty sexist. “Women are crazy for this makeup”, “increase your femininity”. As if beauty products are the only thing that define women and their femininity.
Wait does it say to new fever among white girls??? Wth!!??
haven't  watched  yo  videos  in  forever  how  the  hell  you  got  7.7m????
That wasn't Spanish 😭😭😭😭😭🤣🤣
6:19, it’s not spanish babe, it’s portuguese. hahaha
You translated the Portuguese basically spot on 😂😂😭😂😂😂
Even though that is not my pics, but.... Im annoyed
Kristine:I just wish people would stop being assholes Me: Me too I wish they stoped copying you And also sorry if I spelt your name wrong oops xd love you
"i can't read spanish" she says,  reading a brazilian ad
Is there a way to help like reporting the ads?
Get wrecked company’s
i never imagined that cristine would ever know what “gringa” means hahahahahahaha, EVER.   as a mexican this makes me cringe a little bit lol
I mean, it is very ✨white girl✨ of Christine to say "I can't read Spanish" for obvious Portuguese. So the thieves had just one point.
in brazil we call "gringa" peoplo who are from other country, the most common example its for americans
The only David's tea in my city just closed down 😭
GOsh
It's Portuguese & it says? the new fever among caucasian women
I have to confirm that Gringa means foreign girl, she looked so confused lmao
There's  a bunch of loser theives who are way to stupid  to come up with  their own ideals.!
Of course it's Lafayette, Louisiana stealing posters. lmao
It wasn't Spanish, it was portuguese
maybe its time to put the watermark closer to the middle of video frame, do the white watermark on the bottom and then do a more transparent watermark in the frame so they cant blur it out
😁👍 I immediately call out any image/video thieves however I'm able to- in the comment section or by leaving a "review" of said product (if they can fake advertise it, I can fake review it). 💁🏻‍♀️ On many occasions I have seen them take down the stolen content within the following days/week, so putting their vile behavior on blast obviously works. Lol
Eu vendo o "nova febre entre as gringas" 👁️👄👁️
Cristine it's not a spanish ad it's a brasilian one, it's portuguese! Gringo and gringa is a slang for "foreingner", so if you were here in brasil peope could say "Cristine is a foreingner" in portuguese "Cristine é estrangeira" as they could say "Cristine is a gringa" in portuguese "Cristine é gringa" and both means tha same, you are not from Brasil. And if you are interested in where do it come from: the word comes from the spanish word "griego" that means greek and was used because greek is very difficult to understand. That gave origin to the expression "talking greek" that means talking something incomprehensible, and then that was shortened to gringo... and here we are. I personally never saw someone using gringo or gringa in a offensive way, so I don't think that is the case, but yeh... it's strange.
not @ her for using a mallet as a gavel ahahahahah
On Facebook these are drop shipping stores. What happens is they take content from previous ads and reuse them.
Gringo or gringa actually refers to people from the US of the A
Who else noticed that the gavel is a mallet with holo taco stickers
I love this chanel. Its so sad how people not only steal her nail art but also make money off of them.
Omg gringa means white girl that’s WILD😭, they’re basically raving about how it’s the new thing for them. Love ya simply!
I wanna know the TEA like did you sue? How much $$? Is that too nosey of me? Probably...
Heck no why that not good
11:28 "I can't read spanish" that's portuguese 😂😂
6:45  that's Portuguese XD I was so confused like... A spanish who couldn't read it and then I was like... Oh... It's not spanish
not ya'll getting pressed that she thought it was spanish...
I still cant get over just how pretty Cristine is
Who thinks she should make a vlog channel called simply cristine?
🙄🙄🙃🤑😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
I went to a Cali nails and they did this with her nails
If i saw that in real life i would legit call the police.  Not the emegency line ofc but someone at the fraud department.
These people should be sued but christine lets it slide for now  They should be greatful
cristine is like so gorgeous wth 🥴
Christine, you need to file a major lawsuit to companies who catfished your pictures and your videos without your consent and trying scam to people.
I feel bad for you Christine. I feel everyone has been catfished and scammed
First!!
LMAO gringa is a white girl
me having a heart-attack because of of her nail polish in the back ground I only have like 5 nail polishes
Jajajajajajajaa “gringas” jajajajajaja
SPANISH????
Just went  to Edealme’s fb page the user took out all of your photos or videos that she had, btw That was not Spanish could be Portuguese
Actually if you do this in germany u pay a looooot for punishment 😱
I searched for an aloe plant on google earlier and now I been getting these ads for some shampoo with aloe and hemp in it. Lol. 😂
Gringa means white Cristine they are calling you a white girl and I know this because I am hispanic
I can't stop looking at christine's hair in this video.. it looks shiny and silky 😍
Lmao I’m from Argentina lol that’s so mean of them to do
I demand more troom troom
6:19 thats not spanish thats portugués 😂
here we have a nice young lady casually calling out companies for stealing for her 🌷
Lies. Cristine still clearly has nails on her hands.
6:20 thats not even Spanish 😂
what i do on tiktok is i put the watermark in the middle of the picture/video and make the watermark a little faint and then they can’t crop out your watermark because it’s in the middle of the video/picture
They named "sponsoredcontent37093", they didn't even tried to be real
I bet the thumbnails were actually stolen by an advertising company who sells them as stock images to salons. That seems more likely to me than so many salons screenshotting, cropping and blowing up a thumbnail idk
the thing with a few of them is that they don't even know what they're doing is wrong. they probably just googled nail powder and printed the flashiest one. they need to be made aware.
Not trying to make excuses for anyone! But I think for some of the nail salons they're probably googling "dip powder nails" and your thumbnail comes up. And some people don't think to check the source of a photo on Google before using it.
Can you do a hair care video please?
I know it’s still stealing someone else’s content but I feel like the salons using the thumbnail aren’t on the same level of thievery and scamming that the people literally using her face are.
The zesty lily focally irritate because tail culturally injure excluding a decorous crop. festive, heavenly heavy hellish eyeliner
the word Gringro or Gringras are indeed not good words basically means you are not part of our people and culture . Also white people be looked down and can be hated for no reason.
That wasn't even spanish🤦‍♀️
OH NO GRINGOS is basically “white people” but it is used more in a meaner way it can be used as a insult depending on who and how you say it
Love how she doesn’t understand what’s written and neither does google, since ITS NOT Spanish....  Common guys, not that hard
They use famous people faces for click bait
i can't be the only one who finds this video a tad distasteful
BINDERS OF AFFIDAVITS. Thank you for the humorous jab at the ridiculous US of A lol... And yes... I'm American lol
i love how she hides the water mark like gacha betch
i just need to tell you C, thats protuguese not spanish
I sent that one from a store here in Brazil, it’s basically saying that it was the new trend among ppl from other countries (it’s not spanish btw 😂😂)
We all came for the tea
Love y vibe
*the language not even being Spanish*
7:30 LMFAOO This is an Algerian meme page, let me translate  "The newest technology in nail polish industry, which is a printer that prints any photos from your phone on to your nails in 35 seconds. Only in Algeria.  Click on the photo to go to the official page of this printer"  I cannot believe they've done that lmao
Christine that is not Spanish, that is Portuguese
I think these nail salons basically googled something relating to nails, your thumbnail showed up and they were like "hmmmm an already edited photo? great! lets print it"
The dip powder company is probably sending the posters along with its product. The company stole your pic- NOT the salon. The salon probably has no clue it’s stolen content. In fact, the salon probably purchased the dip powder to sell BASED on the company’s stolen content.
IDENTITY THEFT IS NOT A JOKES ADS MILLIONS OF INFLUENCERS SUFFER EVERY YEAR
HER EARBUDS OMG FROM 2000
Me no coping my fav youtuber
Hi there , just to clarify it's Brasilian not Spanish. It means it's the latest trend in nail polishes.  I 'm Portuguese from Portugal and that's writen in Portuguese from Brasil . Just for you to know ^^  Portugal- Europe Brasil- Suthern América
Hiii Cristine!💞 I love u and I love ur videos! Ur my comfort YouTuber and I love u so much! Byeee
I can explain the printed thumbnails! Google’s images tab displays thumb nails, so they likely googled something like “dip powder nails” looking for any related images and not understanding copyright law.   In fact, I tested my theory by googling “dip powder nails images” and that thumbnail came up as the 7th image and the first one that looks like a nice poster
Why not sometimes put the watermark on your nails?
Yes Guy Tang will totally sell your gringa hair LMAO
Its just nails calm down °~°
This  was amusing....  But should totally be taken as a compliment.  Apparently your nails look better than theirs. Im incline to agree.  Ive learned some fun techniques for my nails following you over the years.  Call me a loyal fan.  Give em hell keep calling them out eventually someone may pay more attention to the actual problem rather than the fact that you cant tell Portuguese from spanish (I cant either)  cant wait to see whats coming next.   💖💖💖💖
Gringa is what we call the wyts 🤣😭
You look a lot like your sister in this video!  Love you simply! Stay logical through 2021! 💅🏼💿💕😍🎄
Tattoo your watermark on your hand lol
Do you have a video about how to make your own nail oil??? Cause my nails can for sure need some, they need some love.
*We shall find them and pour acetone in their eyeballs.*
#SimplyARRESTTHEM
Id prob call em out on their own post..
WHO IS USING THE QUEENS CLIPSSSSSSSS
"I can't read spanish" *cries in portuguese*
They are stealing your Ndentity
And thank you for not buying the products! So many creators when they do this buy the products and I never understood it because they’re then supporting the company.
I think the thumbnails in salons is probably that they just googled it and happen to pick that one
When u order from them what do u get?🤣
What app do you use to edit? I’m just wonder because i make a ton of small videos for my family and it’s fun but one app it’s not cutting it right now. Do you have any recommendations?😂😁💩
I used to watch your videos at night time, when I remember everything that goes on. So I think I’ll be able to catch stealers in seconds when I see one lol- ;v;
I put my watermark in the middle of my video, but with the opacity down
Keep exposing these scammers, we love a good tea spill ☕️
6:52 Dies of laughter...
6:19 Christine that's not Spanish XD it's brazilian/portuguese
I do this type of thing for the company I work for. There are a lot of people on Etsy that think it's okay to use our copyrighted products. It's extremely frustrating and disrespectful to the brand/person who worked hard to create these products. It's not okay at all.
simply:i cant read that me whos from egypt:lol bruh
*in holo we trust*
O M G!!! I have the *exact* same sequin pillows!!!!!!!
You could also tell it was yours because of the real holo background in some clips
That dip power photo is one of the first photos that comes up when you Google "dip powder nails" and click images. I guess they think it's just a free to use photo since it comes up on Google? People need to research their shit better before they just print a giant poster.
Fun fact when u say fun fact people read your comment ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
11:33 i would start playing the video
Ben got there very late lol
"I can't read spanish" that's portuguese lol
The add that you said was Spanish os actually portuguese, and "gringa" Means Foreigner in brazil
I feel kind off offended, in BRAZIL we speak Portuguese NOT SPANISH! Its not that hard
I watched this video on my 2ds XL. I also am writing this comment on my 2dsXL.
Can we just point out how freaking beautiful she is in this and like always, holy shit dude
what if a nail product she’s used in a video used the pictures from a video   does that make sense
Oop-
If you ever cut your hair I will be very sad!!!!!!🥺
So I guess this proves you're a narcissist? Lol
Cristine off topic, but please, omg please please please please please please please please show me the dark arts of this witchcraft: https://www.instagram.com/p/CIQ6sZ3D28n/ 🙇🏽‍♀️🙇🏽‍♀️🙇🏽‍♀️
Thanks to cristine I actually started drinking more ice tea
6:19 not spanish haha, also, a gringa is a white girl (slang in Spanish, but that’s not the language this ad was in) LMAO
Whoever hit the dislike button on this video are probably the people that work for the companies that are stealing Simply's stuff.
Latino people calls white people gringos And it's not nice word
*half of the video is over*  Me: where are the cats🥺
Her saying that she can’t read spanish... what does it have to do with the video? It’s portuguese 😭✋
That’s not Spanish! That’s Portuguese
bruhhh just sue! you get money!
I find this so funny. She's mad and I can tell.... Yet she's being so respectful to not make those companies exactly get the hit of not stealing.
people out here stealing body parts now 😞
THIS IS EVIL THOSE ARE NOT YOUR NAILS
Saw yo nails at Wal-Mart at their nail salons.
The thing you couldn't read is Portuguese and i mean: "the new fever among Americans "
😃 🔪🔪🔪. Is how I feel about them
Can u please do a videos of you just simply painting your nails?
Video Unclear, Nail-less Logical?
I always wonder, we post photos on ig for example and anyone can download it, screenshot it whatever and use it as their own and WE DONT even know about it! Even if I will add logo it can be easily removed :/ how can we track who screenshot something, we simply can't.
That's not Spanish, that's Portuguese from Brazil.
These references to these nail salons @10:21 look photoshopped into the image. Also at 11:17
Christen what am I supposed to do I broke my nail and it when into my nail bed!!!!!
Nail salon owner : use my thumbnail    me: goes to the store ( recognize me b##ch )
“you gonna sell some socks? i don’t think so.”
I literally dm’d her the peeps who took her mirror nails thing video on instagram a month or so ago
um why didnt this show up in my sub feed? daaaang I might have to turn that notification bell on
hey, hey,hey Cristine, dress up  as a catand follow Xyler and Menchie around and bea  cat for     a day. like when you were a sock.
This reminds me of H3 Content Court videos 😂
dude the "i can't read spanish" hit me rIGHT IN THE FEELINGS
Is she like the judge at the same time as she is The person wait what is it called- I don’t know what it’s called honestly T~T
13:42
Where can I get Holo Taco mech?
I'm just going to say I highly doubt people working at that salon printed out a poster size thumbnail off your YT. They likely bought them online from a supplier, who stole them from you. Glad you didn't name the salon, as they may not even have any idea who you are, or that they "stole" anything from you.
You should buy all these products and teals them out         Oop I just made it to the end sorry
Grigas e gringos are how Brazilians call everyone that is not from Brazil/ mostly the people from the US. It doesnt have anything to do with the spanish translation because we speak portuguese and not spanish. Hope I explained It in a way its understandable
6:22 It is not spanish, is actually Portuguese, the video said It was from Brazil
6:12 I cant believe there's a brazilian video..... I apologize for them
we dont now simlpy enemoer she is now simply detectiv
“simplyARRESTTHEMoligical”                        y e s
I LAUGHED AT THE GRINGAS PART OMGG😂😂😂
Ok there's no purpose to the comment only that at 9:22 my name is in there and I was not prepared for Christine to say my name in a video. I literally jumped.   Even the selling the same-
OMG I didn't realize how many people have stolen your name/your content/your brand? This makes me so sad and I'm sorry that this is happening to you and so many people around the world :'( Good thing you are shining light on this subject because there are people like me who just don't know. I'm not an idiot lol I know it happens, but didn't realize how OFTEN it happens. Great job Cristine! <3
Sorry u deserve better
Why not going after these companies legally. It's called theft of image. Call them out and bad mouth them. Play stupid games win stupid prizes.
Simply has to put a water mark across the screen so it’s impossible to steal her photos 👍🏻🤔🤔🙌🏼
You should get a desk mat with your @ on it
ok not siding w the thieves but i think salons have used the pics that show up in google and your thumbnails are always the top results in google photos lol
💅🏻I’m gonna jump em💅🏻
cristine..... that "spanish" ad was actually a Brazilian Portuguese ad Smhhhh
Babe gringa means white girl but in a bad word
I heard that bang and knew, it's court time.
Cristine... "gringas", in Brazil (where the ad is from) just means foreigners. Don't worry, it's not mean lol. They used this because brazilians tend to idolize foreign culture, so whatever people are doing in north america they're trying to copy here.
No one: Absolutely no one:  Me when I saw the hammer: ITS PUNISHMENT TIME!!!!
I wanna see her play among us or make among us nails....
These companies deserve to be found out and be sent to court for stealing
No one is appreciating the stolen hair joke and I’m mad I laughed so hard
ok.. she made a joke about a salon stealing her hair. scary thing is at some salons she would be 100% correct. that actually happens. there is a hair blackmarket, like legit.  plus she has really long healthy hair. especially if she got it cut short they would absolutely steal it. some though will ask.  i got my hair cut short once and the person cutting it asked if she could keep and i did not care. she had a collection of dyed hair so she can show customers what colors actually look like on similar hair so she needs undyed hair for that.
Why have I just noticed Cristine looks like Ally Sheedy
who disliked this? Also why???
I feel ya. I find WAY too many companies illegally selling my art on merch. They are literally pilfering the very thin wallet of a disabled artist who relies on those sales to survive. So you can bet I go after those damned vultures online. I call them out on several site review  portals, look to see if the American based ones can be reported to the BBB, etc,
First of all: is that a sledge hammer If it is: who gave her one
CRISSSS!! That’s not spanish! it’s portuguese, the language spoke in brazil! as a brazilian, i’m here to tell u, and “gringa” means : foreign person, person from another country!
me senti ofendida quando ela disse que não consegue ler espanhol mas era português kkkfkkk
* 16:49   * *Ahem you mean Simply Courtlogical.....*
The companies watching this:👁💧👄💧👁
"I cant read spanish" The ad literally says "Brasil", BRAZILIANS DONT SPEAK SPANISH! It's P-O-R-T-U-G-U-E-S-E
I live with 6 cats 5 dogs and one bunny with my siblings and parents but also my sister is a mother
I still share the DIY nail care video with friends and make the cuticle oil for my use. LOL!
The picture in the minute 7.35 the actually were saying that this is the world first robot who paint a nail design and you can order it from the same instagram account (glad to help ) 😝😝
Christine pls post more I can stop watching your videos
I remember I would watch you!!
Hey you are literally never gon see this but Just wanted to say that the arbic one actually was not a advertisement on you, it was just saying how the nail printer works and how you tried it and it kinda failed. Sooooooo yeah
Portuguese, not Spanish, although "gringas" is Spanish slang.  Also, it said Brazil at one point.
does she have a a holo play button?
Video Idea: Unedited video (troom troom hacks testing or nail tutorial) probably no one is going to see this but worth a shot
I haven’t watched you in 3 years and omg I miss these ❤️
She should make a tea line
If u don’t know what gringa mean it mean white girl and gringo mean white boy
Your hair looks so good in this video
Hey can u do sally face nails since u can literally do anything with ur nails
Lol you would make a good judge XD
can't wait for the legaleagle review on this one
OMG SHE SHOULD SIMPLY SUE!!!!!
halo taco sledge hammer.
Okay this ad on the left in 7:33 is in Arabic and it translates to "The latest technology in nail art is this printer, that prints any picture you have on your phone on to your nails in 35 seconds exclusive and only in Algeria " I know  😂
You are very ungratefull from te other video where ur nail broke and said: OmG My LifE iS RuiNeD,like be grarefull some people dont even have nails and wonder whats it like to be to have nails and ur here crying over a nail
6:12 - not Spanish. Portuguese 🤣
👁👄👁
As far as the salon using your thumbnail as a banner, it may not have been them that did it. It could have been the company that made the marketing materials. There's a little sign shop I know of that got caught doing that stuff.
This video was great from start to finish.
Couldn't concentrate, did simply rearrange her nail polish wall again?
PEELY BASE POLISH MOUNTAIN

I have a question for you lol, so where are your pill offs??? I wanna see them again and also if you do can you make a video remaking some of them??
I saw the mutichrome on your face advert before I found your Chanel. Now I know the context 🤣
World wants to know  "Why Beyyn didn't brought the Tea  today??😑😑

Who else is watching this in 3040
how many peapole want cristine to do this again | | V
I havent watcht her in years            Sorry for my bad english
Some people use stolen pics of other people on dating sites, Facebook or other social media etc. I always try to check if any store online use your or other nail artists pics before I buy their product or even consider buying if I'm suspicious of does they have artists consent to use pic or not
I don’t speak Portuguese but I know what gringa means and I was laughing my butt off when she kept saying it over and over, I never even knew the legit definition of a gringa lol
Oooh maannnnn It's Simply Suing Time
When are you going to let Suzie do your nails!!?!?!?
1989: WE SHALL HAVE. FLYING CARS IN 2020 2020: Watching this ✨👁👄👁✨
Let us know if you won your case ! ✌

Petition for Christine to make a matte taco 🌮 💿  (like if u agree :)
I remember the video you did, where you bought stuff off from China, to see if they were actually holo XD. You forgot to mention some of them using your nails' pictures to show their products. So, there are more around the world X)!
I had to see the comments after I saw the "gringas" thing
first of all, i know this sounds stupid but, either i had a dream about it or i don't know, BUT.... i clearly remember that simply made a video about her new collection of her holo taco nail polish, and the color that i remember was beige, sea blue, a limited edition  i forgot what that was, and purple-pink ish  LMAO
ben should have a peely bag too
The problem is Cristine is just too bootiful and good at nails they can't resist.
Simply I just found a commercial for go glam nail salon I’m about to check your channel for it but if not their it looks like something to bring the crap onto
I am so sad for you  I wish you the best
Paint your gavel Holo 🌈💿
poor Cristine doesn’t know what gringa means 😔
It's in portuguese not spanish 😂 but they are similar
are you a teenager
Can you do a video reacting to celebrities nails
You know what. (No one cares.)
FYI, following one of Christine’s tutorials IS NOT plagiarism. the difference is that A. you produced it yourself and B. you aren’t making money off of it. these companies ARE trying to make money and using copyrighted images in a deceptive way. I hope that helped if you were confused about this!
we should put them in simply jailogical
"I can't' read spanish" girrrrl nooooooooo that'ts portuguese lol   And '"gringa" isn't mean, it's just a term we use in Brasil that means "foreign"
just put holo stickers all over your desk
This is rlly random but before Christine was famous I asked her to shout out my nail art account and she basically told me to fuck off and asked if I wanted a “cookie” lol
Pineapple 🍍
Did you tested new holo eyeshadows?
christine i dont trust u with a hammer-
When she said spanish, i a spanish Speaker can say that is not  spanish, is portuguese  😅 love you Cristine you are one of the reason  i now inglish now 😅
Simply!!!! Congrats on 7.7 MILLION subscribers!!!!!!!!!
You should do a video trying those products to see if they’re at least good enough to have your face on it!
6:56 Costa Rica representing 😂😂 I love how here it's not an insult, it's so common that it stopped being an insult 😂😂 We can even say to our US family gringo or gringa and it would be totally fine to everyone 😂
I’m coming back here a year later (yes hello, I’m back bitches) and be like: “oh... she got a new intro... nice”
Gringa means white girl Christine (just so you know for next time if there is one lol) luv u vids
WHAT THE FUCK, THE EMAIL SAYING GOT CAKE WAS RESTOCKED CAME OUT 2 MINUTES AGO AND ITS ALREADY OUT OF STOCK!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT DID YOU HAVE 5 NAIL POLISHES OR SOMETHING!?!?!?!?
Lol yes... "gringa" means white girl 😂
me expecting the companies to say sorry in the comments lmao
Girl in Brazil we speak Portuguese this ain’t no Spanish
I honestly don't know why you'd want to go against someone who works for the government. She's obviously intelligent, missmaams
THIS PORTUGUESE 😪😪😪😪
Nailogical when are you gonna break another nail?
you should put your watermark on your fingers!!
Cristine its been 3 years or 2? Idk but it’s been years you need to recreate things from your peely bag again
Let’s just report there post
lmfao the new fever among the yts 😂 that's just what latin/hispanic people call yt people
Girl you’re so pretty! XD Random companies
I love how under every video it says “ ♡ Subscribe to never miss n̶e̶w̶ ̶n̶a̶i̶l̶ ̶a̶r̶t̶ ̶t̶u̶t̶o̶r̶i̶a̶l̶s̶! ” she crossed it out 😂 I love her🤣
Either Simply has branded a custom mallet with Holo Taco, or she put her logo onto a store bought mallet, therefor claiming that she has created the mallet, which is stealing ownership from the actual manufacturer. So either she’s very well prepared OR she’s doing something similar to what these companies are doing HmMmmMmMmMM XD
On the tasty app ther is a recipe for overnight oats! I think they watch you!
i can appreciate how beautiful it is to get your nails done but i am strongly against it being this toxic ..
This is Portuguese Cristine :) (#2)
11:28 uhhh Cristine that’s not Spanish it’s Brazilian Portuguese 😃
Hi Christine, LOL RE-MIX OMG dolls have finally made a hollowgraphic doll called Kitty K. Her shoes, headband, outfit, nails are hollow. Her hair is also hollow. Please check it out! Your adoringly awesome fans Isabella(7yrs old) and mom Crystal.
Cristine: I can't speak spanish Me: girl, it's portuguese, FROM A BRAZILIAN AD
You should get a table protector with your watermark repeated on it  for filming so they can't crop it out of the video lmao xD
the queen went off lol
That's not spanish Cristine, it's Brazilian portugueeeese hahahahahah
You should go back to polish mountain and do the holo edition :)
I don’t know what you did to you hair here, but it looks so good!
For a brazilian, gringa(female) and gringo (male)  is anyone that is not brazilian
That's my girl 😎👏👏👏 Go Cristine  😉❤
here in brazil (where we speak BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE) we call foreigns as gringos lol
gringo and gringas basically means white boy or white girl so they kinda called you a white girl-
first time watching Christine in years, the only thing i can say is that seeing her and that background triggered my trauma hard 😹😹😺
Exhibit c is actually in Arabic it says   “ latest technology for manicure , printer that will draw you any picture in your phone in 38 sec .. exclusively in Algeria “  👌🏻
Not Spanish.... Portuguese 😩 it says Brasil right there
"Let's go.... to court"
Exhibit c was Arabic
No one: Cristine: no❤️ no❤️ no❤️ no❤️ no❤️ no❤️ no❤️ no❤️ no❤️ no❤️
8:40 Why the fuck would they use a Shania Twain song???? She's a queen but that's unexpected 😂
Fyi that is not Spanish 🤣 is Portuguese
I am a huge fan I watch u since u started I love u
Btw after the Spanish post there was an Arabic post and its translation is “the last thing technology has come to , nail beauty , and its a printer that draws any picture from your phone on you nails for 35 seconds “
I love how the "Binders" are Holo, but why wouldn't it be?
🤣 “recognize me yet bitch” 🤣
IVE BEEN TO THE SALON WITH THE DOUBLE DIP POWDER!!! It’s in my hometown
You should definitely go to one of those salons and ask for your own nail art. :p Maybe they're just fans.
When you’re last name IS AMAYAAAAAAA
Grega means white girl LMFAOO
6:08 that is not even Spanish though I believe it’s Portuguese 😭😭🤣🤣 I’m rolling
Just a random comment: My strange addiction's:I LOVE BREAD  kristine:I LOVE TEA meh:me too
Cristine!! Today was the first day of my new job promotion and I celebrated by buying loads of holo!!! So excited to holo-fy my hands and feeties!!
Le StRoNg HaMmEr Of NaIloGiCaL cOuRt
They better bring your nails back! They'll miss you!!!!!!!
oh my god you should buy their products and try em out and see if they are quality products?
We gunna talk about the fact that’s a sludge hammer? No hate I love you🤍
Wow i love your hair like that try make your hair curly and volume
OMG they called you gringa lol I mean gringa is not necessarily an insult, it depends on how you use it, in the add it wasn't offensive. But you can definitely use it as offensive. Anyways you are a lovely gringa to us Cristine :D
*don’t steal Ben, she’ll  S U E  you.*
That wasn't Spanish lol, I think it's Portuguese (gringo/a   is what we call people that are from the u.s.)
can you please upload more!!!
Is gringo/a mean?  Yes and no.  It's basically a term used to describe a white person, usually not in a nice way.  But you can also use it to tease as well.  Just like you might call a friend an idiot - it's not nice, but you don't really mean it in a bad way.  It all depends on the context.
Honey I know you didn't just seek a translation on *Urban Dictionary*
I am portuguese and gringa is used mostly among Brazilien  to describe an American girl and no is not ofencive
I don't think you'll see this comment since this video came out a week ago.. but I just bought the multichrome bundle, file, peely base, and long lasting base for my mother and I hope she likes them when she gets them for Christmas since your brand is amazing and I have high hopes.
to clarify the gringas thing, in brasil (the nail ad was in portuguese, not spanish) the word gringo(a) is simply used as someone who is from a different country, not necessarily a mative english speaker, mostly white people, and it’s not necessarily a bad word to use towards someone. HOWEVER, this same word is used all around latin america in the way the urban dictionary definition is written ( it is kind of a mean word but only 90% of the time lmao) towards white americans or white native english speakers
this aint spanish, is brazilian portuguese. and gringa is not a bad words, it just mean foregn, actually people in america get offended by it for no reason whatsoever
Hey can anyone help me out I wear gel nails but i know that i have to dry your nails out to get your gel to stick , so what's the best option to help my nails , I dry them out then use nail oil straight after its dried correctly but I still have damaged nails , I take them off correctly (by that I mean I dont scratch off my gel or "pull it off" I do wrap my nail in acetone but take off after 5 mins then use a cotton pad and acetone to remove) advice is greatly appreciated ❤
Cristine thinking brazillian portuguese was spanish oh nooooo cristineeeee
Case closed
Wait queen what did you do with you're face bruh you look amazing in this video!
React to the react chanel reacting to your nail polishes :)
The last part is in Spanish is and it promises  some big and resistant for até 20days.
This is not Spanish I am Mexican and this is not Spanish maybe the last part let me check
I could translate it in Spanish
in the moment she looked at an ad in portuguese there will be only brazilians comments here.
can you do Christmas nail art? for some reason I cannot seem to get into the Christmas spirit this year
OKAY ANYWAYS
Your hair looks great!!! ❤
You know Ann Readon (how to cook that ) made holo chocolate
Hey I have a video idea for you maybe you can see what your cats do when you put them in ice i though of this because your chanel is just nail art no more🤣🤣🤣 your so funny I hope you use this idea
In✨holo✨we trust.
Can someone get me nail oil 😂😂😂😂
"I can't read Spanish" HUN that was Portuguese 👀
Yeah both definitions were  pretty far out, I’ve grown up hearing that word and it’s pretty much always referring to white peoples lol
Thank you! I never understand the creators who buy the products that stole their image for advertisement. Like, yes youre bashing them but you still gave them money? This was a great video!
my cousin buys the actual product to sell to Cambodians since Cambodians can't get those products! (That was really random)
Can you do a for my birthday please my birthday is December the 8th
PLEASE DO A POLY GEL VIDEO
Its been awhile since last i watch her videos..i think last i watch is 2 years ago and then i got busy with work and rarely found a time to watch you tube and finally here i am. But omg i saw cristhine, did she GETTING YOUNG??? THE TIME IS REVERSED????
“but if they are here      *thanks for the view* “
In Argentina i was told a few times that gringo is just anybody who's white and foreign, so europeans also can be called gringo as well.  I wonder how its like in mexico... im guessing there is stricly for ppl from the US in a derogatory way. But maybe im wrong 🤷‍♀️
do yall fucking remember that we had a funeral for a fucking nail that Chris broke like if ur an OG lol
"Why am I supporting assholes?" HAHAHHAHAHHAH
CRISTINEEEEEE!!!! A channel known as How to Cook That by Ann Reardon (I don’t exactly know how to spell her name) made HOLO CHOCOLATE! (It’s not super sparkly, but it reflects just like Holo!)
Here is the translation for the arabic add: The new latest technology for nails, its a printer that draws any picture you have on your phone it draws it on you nails in 35 seconds, only available in algeria. :>
I know this feeling. It’s not nails but one time I saw a Chinese game app stealing my videos to promote their game (my video was literally a YouTube ad) and I was really chocked since this game has a lot of in game purchases and that they didn’t credit me. I felt so upset. I sent them direct message on their Facebook page. They read the message but I never got any answer. It makes me soo mad 😤
Can we talk about how clear and healthy her skin looks??
She looks so different with her hair down
In Latin America, the word “gringo” (male) or “gringa” (female) refers to a caucasian foreigner.   The word could be derogatory depending on the context and country.   There are three versions of its origin:  a) Spaniards used the phrase “está en griego” (it’s all Greek to me) to express that something was unintelligible. The modern version is “está en chino” (it’s in Chinese).   b) During the Mexican-American war, American soldiers sang a song that contained the lyrics “green grow the lilacs”, which then turned to “gringo” due to Spanish pronunciation.   c) Also Mexican-American war: battalions would be identified by colors, so the Mexican commander would shout “green go” as a way to encourage the Mexicans to advance against the Americans to get them out.
We need a pastel collection plz
Hey simply!!! So I think it’s would be ADORABLE if Zyler, Menchie, and Crusty (Safiya’s cat)  did a collab😍
thats not a gavel thats a hammer...christine isnt just taking names
E
I dare you to do polish mountain using only Holo Taco products
" i can't read espanish" *my brazilian ass crying because its portuguese*
hello im  a big fan and i was waondering if you put you nails in lemons they grow faster?!?! also love you
Why hasn’t Ben been in your vids?
That was not spanish.
Show Ben good stolen face! I need to see him get grown-up/philosophical debate on their asses!
*Watch intro*  oooh~ I sence the copyright claims right now! & their just!   when they use stuff without permission and without credit, that should be punished
she looks so pretttyyyyy
the companies watching this video: 👁👄👁
We have the same birthday 17.10 😂
Please test out the products
Can someone call the White House and tell them that this is what evidence looks like?
Christine!!!!! Please PLEASE do OYSTER 🦪 NAILS!
I love how cool she is about it, like how she is laughing about it.
Book em, Dano!
6:12 portuguese speaking people be looking at this like 👁👄👁
I wonder if Cristine knows that companies takes pictures from her videos of her hair and makes clams about there products making there hair longer or healthier.
its portuguese, not spanish!!!
4:57 why does it say on the blue ting kup teraz which means in polish buy now ;-;
OMG I JUST REALIZED YOU HAVE SEVEN MILLION CONGRATS !!!! i've been a sub since around 2015!!!!! You're awesome Cristine (Im sorry if i spelled ur name wrong i'm terrible at spelling)
Where do you get your nail vinals
gringa means white girl
your skin and hair are looking amazing!! so healthy
Lol I’m from Costa Rica 🇨🇷 and when you read about gringa lol 😂 I almost die and yes it is used as a derogative term for English speakers mostly USA, but basically all non Latinos lol 😂
I love how the dip powder ones are still in a form of a question. Lol...dip powder nails? Yes? No? Maybe?
I do kinda want you to buy to nail polishes to see what they're using your content to sell lol I know it's supporting them but I wanna know!....its science!
That mug is so nice
You should do polish mountain with all of your holo taco polishs
One of the few youtubers still killing it
I saw in your video a polish words "kup teraz" hmmmm is something wrong?
Cristine looks like the child from Christmas chronicles
It always bothered me that you put holosexual instead of holophile. You're not sexually attracted to glitter and want to fuck it.
When you look up nail dip powders on Google images your thumbnail comes up so that's probably why so many use it
Wow
I would sue if something like this was done to me
Your know some times add the water mark on the actual nail or in the middle of the screen when you show your nails. ILY
Holo chocolate https://youtu.be/6p3T_KHbfhs
That's not spanish HAHAHA
Cristine: What’s next, pictures of my feet? Me: Why are you sharing pictures of your feet online Cristine 👁👄👁
I know we obviously do not want to support people illegally using your image but I would loveeeee to see Christine review some of these crap products
i learned so much from this video lmaoaoaoa
6:20 that’s not Spanish Christine😂 it’s Portuguese
Cristine, if u wanna do any makeup video (again), do check out robert welsh (:
Can you do a video reviewing the KiaraSky Gelly Kit on your oThErRr HaAaNd
You know you are successful when other ppl steal your videos xD
Please print BT21 on your nails.
I always take 3 month breaks from the channel just to binge watch the videos later on
you should recreate 5 more peely's!!!!!
Gringa or Gringo is slang latinos use to describe white ppl from the USA or Canada, maybe even Europe. Its not necessarily something bad or mean tho it can be used in that way.
Hey Christine just wondering what stamping plate do you recommend for beginners?
i hope you sue
Please make a Neon Collection for holo taco I would honestly love that! ❤️💿
i think the irl nail salons just googled “dip powder” and printed out the first google images result
Girl I haven’t seen you since the beginning of Quarantine
its rlly funny how she is pointing out all the companies but is not giving out names. lol
Maybe that multi chrome all over your face is why your face now hates all products.
That's not spanish, it's portuguese
Simply, I don´t mind if you are not able to read in portuguese, but you could at least allow Brazil at the shipping adress of your website!!!!!!! I love your videos and i can´t urdestand why you don´t want me to spend all my money on nailpolish hahha
it's funny when she says that she can't read spanish but actually that was portuguese fkkkg anyway, we all make mistakes. so dw.
E do nada aparece um ad em português kakakakakakakaka
Gringa es no bueno
that exhibit b one was from brazilians
it’s portuguese:)
Pro tip - place the watermark/signiture in a place that would be difficult to watermark,for example I would sign my art on the arm if I can
06:18 that is Portuguese and NOT Spanish! ;)
104,898 views for your naked nails😲 now we know why so many views😏😏
I work at a print shop and it's amazing how many people we have to turn away for wanting to print something that is copyright infringing! 🤢🤮 Just pay for a new design, its not that much! I'm more shocked that they're able to print thumbnails at a pretty decent quality though 🤔🧐
I died when she read in portuguese, i feel complete
Do u want me to read the Arabic 😂 I’m fluent btw!
we STAN simplynailogical!!! QUEEN!  💅💅💅💅 👑👑
Am so glad you  have made a video on this.  Company's need to be called out and people need to be more aware of what thses Companys are doing by stealing other peoples work. Thank you for making this video and calling out the sh**ty Companys 💗
Watch her work her swollen face into her nail polish brand somehow now that this is an infomercial channel lol
Can you review poly gel?
4:56 Oh i see a Polish screenshot over there, almost didn't notice it although it looked similar becouse i'm Polish hahha
That wasn’t spanish btw...
Portuguese, darling. Not Spanish
It's funny how Cristine never mentioned suing until she saw Ben's nails and picture😂
I LOVE you ❤️❤️❤️😍
oh wo- I forgot about you-
we clearly can se your true nails .. lol that juste de most stupid things hahaha
You should make a video where you go to this nail salons and pretend to be regular costumer and then.... SHABLAM you tell them who you are and that they are using ur content.
gringa in my language means white girl
I have a question, what time of tea do you get from Starbucks? I really need to know
Cristine: "Hey Simply!" My Siri: "Did you mean me?"
Omg I was about to comment and tell you that it’s literally what it means “new hot trend used by white girls” lmao that’s what they are saying XD good detective work
In the Arabic post what they say is an explanation of how nail printer thingys work and their ur face to make u look like a user of this product (your welcome)
These nails are awesome! Idk why some people would steal them.
You look really really beautiful Cris💕
"gringo/a" means white and generally it's meant pretty offensively
friend, gringa is a spanish term for a white woman FYI. sorry if u already knew that.
But is that hammer for sale....?
I bought a hollow bag which you gonna love ❤️
girl that ain’t Spanish, Portuguese is way different from Spanish
Love how she’s more interested in suing them for bens face and nails then her own.
I'm back here after years..
Mi mother and I did wood burnings, and have our company etched on the back of the product. Some dip on etsy thought they were sly and was tryna sell our product for more
The new hot trend for white girls...yes...exactly
What if Christine did a bob ross painting tutorial on her nail
Your channel name should be, SimplyHolological
We love you Canadians and Canada too
Ok, I’m not ok with this, but I’m just putting it out there that you did give them permission. When you sign up for social media you don’t pay for, in the terms and conditions it says the makers own your content, videos, pics, ect. They’re then allowed to sell it to whoever. If you don’t pay for the product, you are the product.   JUST CRAMPED MY HAND WRITING THAT
Your hair is just amazing in this vidéo !
Isn’t taco 🌮 Mexican? Yet u use it to sell ur nail products??? R u Mexican ?
my aglaN is big
I just spent 3 hrs watching random Holo Taco videos on all the socials. YOU ARE THE QUEEN!!! When you aren’t using holo taco, what’s your “go-to” brand for good, funky polish?
What was up with her face?
Tinha que ter coisa do Brasil PQ MEU SEM OR KKKKKKKKKKKKK
gringo means white boy and gringa means white girl. hopefully i got it right that’s what i was told it meant
JUST BOUGHT THE HOLO TACO NAIL POLISHES OMGGG!!!
I went to salons that used my nails  Getting my thumbnails on my nails Trying out brands who stole my thumbnails
I like your trash can!
Damn, Cristine! It sucks that you can't do much of anything. I'm not educated enough to be familiar with how to fight this. I'm sorry!
Hi    Read more...
Seeing all of the old nails brought me back🤧
"Wait. It doesn't turn green, it turns GREY. *Ewww, why?* " PFFFT. XD
Nail identity theft is not a joke is not a joke jim millions of families suffer from it every year
I know how you feel Christine. I'm an artist and have seen YouTube artist steel my designs, styles and methods,  without a shour out or credit to me. I only have a Facebook page atm, but hope to start a channel soon. Frustrating to say the least...😡🖼🎨👎
i haven't "ben" watching your content for a while and the first thing i remember "holosexual" :>
That wasn’t spanish btw hahahaha i love you 🖤
hi
shouldve put this on tiktok. they would find the people in a heartbeat
Can you plz do mine nails
I'm arab, at 7:31 it's basically saying "the newest nail technology, it can draw whatever you want from your phone onto your nails in 35 seconds, exclusive in Jordan" (I'm not sure what algazaer is in english I thinks its jordan)
* Portuguese in one video * She: "I can't read Spanish".  Ahh~ I wish they think Italian is Spanish too~ Las lenguas románticas son parecidas, pero vamos, hay productos como shampoo, instructivos con varios idiomas... America uh? Ja
Where is that teal and holo tumbler cup from? I need one
You put it online, people steal. Is what it is... sadly.
"They'd probably steal my hair" 🤣 100%
cristine my school is the english academy but TEA for short! so im in the school of tea
12:51 "they'd probably steal my hair" I laughed to much at that omg
Did you know you are on filmweb? XD
“Are we satisfied”        No.” She will never be satisfied, he will never be satisfied!”    Please tell me if you know the quote
Of course the hammer was holo. Why did I even question it?
That wasn't Spanish 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I wonder if the nail salons bought those thumbnail images on an image bank. It would make more sense to me that one person was stealing your images and re-selling them than a bunch of individual salons really wanting to use a YouTuber's thumbnail 🤔
We use the word Gringa as a  Derogatory term just like Gringo. We call the white man Gringo because at the border of Mexico leading into the US the white man/woman tells us "Green, go." And that is where the term has originated from but a common thing that Hispanics do in our language and grammar, is that we give nouns genders, so in the ad that said Gringa the "A" at the end would direct itself to a female while "O" will direct itself to a male. Think of "Nino" and "Nina". One means boy and one means girl only because of the "A" or "O" at the end. But we use Gringo and Gringa as an insult to white people.
The salons probably just google-image-searched some things to put up. That dip powder nails thumbnail that a bunch of them were using shows up when you google image search "dip powder nails." A lot of people, even the younger generations, don't know that the images from google aren't always free for public use. That doesn't make it okay, but I just thought I'd offer up a more understandable explanation than them just being shady.
Any update on what happened with her face???
Sometimes I forget your a person and then about once or twice  a year I find you and start watching you again
the irony of this video not having a watermark
Wish, Wish, Wish, Christine is gonna come for you!
One of the reasons I like the nail salon I go to is because all the photos on their instagram and wall are actually from their clients. I get asked if they can take a photo every time they finish my nails and I see them posted on instagram and their wall.
“They’ll probably steal my hair” 😬
What's on YOUR OTHER HAND!?
What she shoulda said with the hammer: nailed it Missed opportunity
was it just me or dose Cristina look so pretty with her hair like that
Not Christine saying she can't read Spanish on a Portuguese video,, 😩😩 whyyy
Basically gringa means white girl
Soo......I watch an adult video from time to time and her theme music was in one of them 🤣
The latest technology of nail beauty has arrived, which is a printer that paints any image you have on the phone on your nails within a seconds Exclusively and only in Algeria I click on my phone and come out to you the official page of this machine.

Me watching ur videos while adding 100 layers of clear toco:👁👄👁
That's not spanish!!! It's portuguese!
woke up to my friend screaming HEY YOU LIKE SIMPLYNAILOGICAL RIGHT DID YOU SEE HER LEARNING WHAT GRINGO WAS AND CALLING PORTUGUESE SPANISH on my chat
Look at the link you might like  it
spanish? SPANISH?! HAHAHA
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3T_KHbfhs&t=9s
It wasn't Spanish... it was Portuguese  I guess ... 😑🤐🙄🤨😬🥺😩🥱
I made a holo video for you of a holo pillow and a holo candy fidget spinner. Go watch it and the candy fidget spinner is called  Fidget Pop
ITS NOT SPANISH ITS PORTUGUESE 😭😭😭😭 and gringa means a person that speaks English, please do not confound Spanish with portuguese its like confounding English from uk and English from Canada or USA
7:10 Noo its not mean XD well depends if you feel offended by it Im latin and we normally say Gringos/Gringas to ppl that were born on United states Or in general were born talking english XD  I wasnt born talking english so that dosent make me a gringa Lol
That is not Spanish! Jajaja I think it's Portuguese
It drives me crazy when I see this crap... I have called out many companies out for this in the comments and let the person know but as you said there’s not much you can do.
I think you should take the pottermore sorting hat quiz (if you haven't already) and paint your nails your house colour but holo for all us harry potter fans
In the thumbnail you look a lot like your sister
Check these Chinese companies posting your stuff on Instagram 👍🏻 watermarks on all!!!!
She is lovely funny 😜
2:02 4:22 Dear Cristine, I love your videos but pls don't use that word. It makes me cringe. Anyway is fine. Anyways is not. In fact that word doesn't grammatically exist  Edit: I am not even a native but it still makes me cringe😂
2:33 Ummm....i think you meant simply NAILtectives... Isn't it😉😉😉
wow you are getting old
People be shakin when cristine brought out the hammer
I guess you didn’t see that Icycreamyy had their watermark on the top right of your watermarked footage. Which they cropped out your watermark. That’s even more shady. They’re trying to make it look legit for the people who might know whomever this pic or footage is from. Making it look like the creator let them use their footage. Which most people know that would make the creator look like a liar about the product they’re helping to sell. So we know it’s stolen stuff ‘cause the content creator would’ve at least made a video or picture just for the product(s) they’re trying to help sell. No matter if they’re being honest about what they’re trying to help sell, they at least want the pic or video to look legit.
Yo u should do a video where you put on all your nail polish at once on one finger.
13:07 Exhibit G
10:07 Exhibit F
So 7:32 am Arabic so I can translate what is written this account is saying that 3d printer you use on your nails is explosive and you only can find it there, I'm MAD 😡
3:45 I immediately thought of David'sTea
What are you going to do about this?? I wouldn’t stand by and let it happen
11:24 it's brazilian portuguese
"does that mean, like, the new hottest trend among...white girls?" THAT'S IT ACTUALLY LMAOOOO
Not no one
Your not even american right? Your Canadian right?
“Long lasting huh?! Yeah....”     *product can only last up to 6 hours*
I know this is a little late but on the Spanish one that says gringas the second meaning that you pulled up was the right definition
yaas love seeing stuff from argentina
Gringa means white girl and it's not that nice 🤣🤣 but I'm pretty sure that was Portuguese... And I dunno if they use it the same as we do in Spanish
Simply nai’law’gical
SUE THEMMMM
I want a video of her buying the products that use her nails and try them out. It would be interesting how the product is actually made
I just bought my first nail polish from Holo Taco and I’m super excited!!
I was gonna write a big rant...but I'm just gonna say,...I love you're tea cup 😁
Uhm... not spanish 6:23
Lol actually pouring myself a cup of tea as she says take a tea break then I realize she has my cup that I'm drinking out of
6:10 that portugues, not spanish
Christine that was not even Spanish 😂😂😂😂😂 6:47 im diying, love ya 😂😂
Is it just me or does she look younger in here
Exhibit B is in Portuguese, Cristine.
7:29 says “latest technology for the nails , which is a printer for nails , it prints any picture you have on your phone on your nails in 35 seconds now only in Jordan!”
Me gasping when she just repeatedly says gringa 😂😂😂😂
They love your products so much that they stole your products👀
Not Spanish, that was Portuguese
You should put a water mark on your nail before you paint it ☺️
Simply is like the only youtuber who I actually enjoy watching because everyone else is just making content about tik tok  😑
I was like she looks different!? It's just cause her hair is down OH! It's pretty tho!
Here’s a solution to the watermark put it on your face so companies can’t crop it out!
I literally just got a church ad at 8:26 THEY KNOW
Her trying to figure out what Gringa meant was way too funny 🤣🤣
Umm that wasn’t Spanish it’s Brazilian
your products are gorgeous but every single one i have gets tacky so easily i never leave the cap open i cover it up even if i have the brush out! never had this issue before.. the "not milky white" is the worst. it's not milky but it's "marshmellowy" haha so sticky and thick  i got the thinning drop by seche vite but what else can i do? i can't keep putting those drops in there it's eventually going to ruin them and these were way too expensive to only get 1/2 uses out of
You should try to re-create 123 go nail videos
Why did I think first when i read the title, that someone like physically took her nails like tf lol
Your videos are awesome!! My favorite nail lady 😇
6:27 CRISTINE THAT IS NOT SPANISH IS PORTUGUESE FROM BRAZIL. I got so shocked when i saw that even ppl from here r stealing ur content omg
Not saying what they did was right, but doesn't your content no longer become your property when you post on social media? Isn't that in the privacy policy? I would imagine it'd be difficult to fight that in court (like you were mentioning)
in America, gringa means white girl & gringo means white boy lol, but it has slightly different meanings around the world (usually meaning english-speaking/non-spanish-speaking or foreigner)
Yeah i was kinda wondering how someone can steal your nail, but now i know
gringo/a means someone who lives outside of brazil, foreign
It's not Spanish, it's Portuguese! lol
spanish?? thats portuguese, brazilian portuguese
Cristine if they crop out your watermark it actually is really horrible for them as it shows knowledge and forethought of theft. I don’t know about Canadian laws but that’s how it works in the states.  I had to research this when someone stole my art. Even though I had the original and proof of theft, I hadn’t watermarked it so it was going to cost more to defend. I learned a lot about watermarking at that point. I found a really informative article on this photographer who was able to sue a couple of his thieves and send out cease and desist letters to the rest. I’ll try to find it and link it here in an edit.
It’s not Spanish, it’s Portuguese. And in Brazil gringo doesn’t mean just “white people”, it means foreigner, anyone that’s not from Brazil (where the ad is from). And it’s not mean at all!
"i can't read spanish" girl that was portuguese TT
6:28 not spanish. portuguese
THEY CALLED YOU A GRINGA NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I was like 8 when I found my first video about you and I’m 10
You should try to place the watermark in the middle of the screen, and see how they dare to cut the vídeo in half, bwhahahahaha
brazilian people after cristine said that she can’t read spanish 👁👄👁
I would seriously phone and make appointments to anyone using the screen shot in their salons haha and turn up asking for the same things. Im glad you didn't send any of them your money xx
is anyone else not seeing she didn’t watermark this vid
GUILTY
i think thats Portuguese not spanish
Exhibit C is in Arabic. It sells a printer for your nails 🌚
I've been watching you since I was 11, I'm 15 now and I've literally always wanted to be a nail tech because of you and my aunt (my aunt was a nail tech). I never pursued it tho because my family told me nail techs don't make a lot of money. I've been watching a lot of nail tech videos recently and I'm gonna start pursuing being a nail tech. just wanted to say thank youuu ily
minute 6:11 is not spanish is portugueseeee
Gringa in Portuguese would translate as foreigner
Among us chooses my nails
she should make another channel called simplygamelogical and play videogames!!
you look pretty in open hair
I forgot how entertaining cristine was ;-; everything she posts is funny AND informative
all those dislikes from the companies being called out XD
Is the table okay tho? You've hit it quite a lot there Cristine :v
who else has been here since 480k
You need new merch....... Please makr something new.... We miss menchie and zyler merch as well as any other merch that you had/have❤️❤️❤️
Lmao if you ever come to India you will find Zyan's  face every where.
Симпли-мститель здесь! :D
Who else thinks that holo taco needs a black h💿l💿 nailpolish.... I think that it should be mix of one coat black and linear scaterd and flakie holo flakes in it💿💿💿
I know it’s all about your nails and you are forever my nail Idol but i also Want you to know that you have the best Hair out there and i thank you for not giving in to stupid demands to cut it. Long hair rules!!!
7:28 translation: The latest of nail beauty technology, it's a printer that paints whatever picture you have on your mobile on your nails in 38 secs, its only available in Algeria, click on the link to go visit our official page.
I love that they watermarked a stolen photo lmao
*"A nova febre entre as gringas" is Portuguese, Cristine, not Spanish. Gringo/gringa is a slang word that can have different meanings depending on the country you're in. For example in Mexico, a gringo (male) or gringa (female) is a person from the United States, not ANY native English speaker. It's not mean, we call them that because they don't use their demonym «Usanian» (United States). American is anyone from the American continent, you from Canada, me from Mexico all the way down to Brazil and Argentina. So when you say American you're not specifying any country, but if you say gringa you know that person is from the U.S.*
You should review Charli Damelio’s nail polish
“ and I have no idea of what’s going on and what’s being written because I can’t read Spanish” yes simply that’s Spanish not Portuguese a totally different language
They stole your face just saying "oh my gosh!" like, couldnt they get literally any other person to say the same thing? so weird. Also you looking up gringa was so funny
*Cristine realizing all her viewers speak Portuguese*
Gringo means white :0
6:00 T-thats not Spanish- That's Portuguese
where are our Holo stickers, Simply? 👀
✨Is the "I CAN'T READ SPANISH" for me✨
I’ve been with you since 3 or 2 mil
I should go to a salon 🔪THEY’D STEAL MY HAIR🔪
It's not Spanish AAAAAAAAA it's Portuguese
I know this is no related but can you pls do a among us video with ben
Espanhol kk... famoso português
gringa is basically foreigner, and sometimes it's dertogatory
I CAN'T READ SPANISH!
BUY NOW! BEN OR THE NAIL POLISH?!
6:11 that aint no spanish i speak spanish fluently it was my first language so im pretty sure its Portuguese
As soon as you said “business ethics” I immediately thought of Billy Madison 🤣🤣🤣
this happened to NikkieTurorials
*Me who should be doing my homework*:  also me: Lemme watch just a tiny bit-
6:09 that is actually Portuguese :)
I cant lie yall.. chris was my big sister that made me laugh when i needed it
I found a pic of my friend's daughter on WISH. She was Moana and my friend did not buy the costume on wish but some how it ended up on. It is STILL on wish years later. You can google moana costume wish. Her daughter loved the outfit and wig that she was giving the kissy lips and a thumbs up. I believe the pic was taken in her bathroom which is even funnier... people stealing photos to make money...
Gringas is a slang term white people (feminine) gringo is (masculine).  Also, that was Portuguese not Spanish.
im watching this in class w the captions on and instead of simply nailogical i got... simply analogical... sis eye-
I find them .................. GUILTY
Cristine I know this is not related to the video but please do a review on the Starrily magnetic nail polishes pleaaase✨
It seems more likely that a print company is selling the advertisements to the businesses who probably have no idea that they are stolen images as they are paying to get them.  Well.. that's what I think anyway.. since its unlikely that so many of them are printing out the exact same thumbnail and printing them out.
9:41 & 9:44, YASS QUEENN! GO GET 'EM!!
Why do I want to eat you 😭🤣😭🤣😭🤣
I love how i got her nail polish add while watching her video
https://glam-shop.pl/pol_m_KOSMETYKI-GLAM_pigmenty-_PERLY-HOLO-197.html Polish holo eyeshadows 😉
The language is not Spanish. Is Portuguese
thanx for the fire content
-11:23 thats not spanish haha
14:36 yesss! I can finally get my very own BEYN!!!
6:18 that's not spanish, it 's portuguese!!
I have a suspicion the nail salons all got those images from the same site in the same way hair salons have the same stock photos on their walls.  There is a distinct possibility they don't even know about Simply.  The fact they all use the same still doesn't seem like coincidence.
I wish everyone would watermark their photos like you do so I can find the real products these scammy companies are ripping off.
Sue their fats off :)
6:20 is not Spanish, it's Portuguese STILL is, tho, content theft
I’ve had my pictures stolen many times, either for selling products or just cat fishing and honestly why would you want to use other peoples pictures and have them complement someone else that’s not you? like they’re saying I AM pretty not you 😂 Also why would you want to lose money from lawsuits rather than just work hard, stop being lazy and make your own content so you can make money fairly?
GIVE CHRISTINE A HOLOGRAPHIC SUBSCRIBE BUTTON!!!!
the language that uses the term “griga” is Brazil , and means people from the US Canadians don’t count I now that because in from Brazil ......
“Gringos” is just the way we Latin Americans refer to people from the USA!! It doesn’t mean anything bad!!
She really slapped a holo sticker to the hammer to do the intro.
"I CAN'T READ SPANISH" I'm dying lol. Ok, just FYI, that was Brazillian Portuguese, not spanish. Also, many brazillians watch your videos, so.. Love from Brazil, anyway :)
Lol it’s Portuguese not spanish
The Polygel one is from Brasil in portuguese 😂😂😂😂
i love how the ad below this video is basically "pubg full gameplay music" but with indian women in tge thumbnail, not to mention its 213:53:20mins. Idk how they did that but I have evidence for not capping 😂and
Hi simply nailogical
https://crowdmade.com/collections/simplynailogical
“I can’t read Spanish” says Cristine while looking at a Portuguese ad.
Gringo is a yankee person. We say gringo in latin america
Hahahhaa that was not spanish, it was portugueese
"I don't read spanish". *reads in portuguese* :(
6:22 WAIT WHY THAT LAST WORD SAY WHITE GIRLS 😭😭
cant believe people do this
Exhibit c is promoting a 3D nail art printer
Then take it up with the law for fuck sake...
Have you tried adding meta data to your videos/images?
Hey Simply!! I love this video it reminds me of a video by a historical dress maker Bernadette Banner where she buys a fast fashion recreation of a gown she made... https://youtu.be/J80J4oaGVnY Its really interesting!
using your video and all is may be wrong but us images thumbnails and all come in the search when you search in google images so some actually dont know they r using yours but they r using it plus unless u copyright it i guess there is not offense in using it ? cuz if thats wrong youtubers also use other youtubers ideas or videos from 5min craft or many. no offense but just a small thing i felt. Using ur brand name or formulas might be wrong but pictures i dont think it is. but ilike they way u spoke to every thing cute
Your hair looks so much darker now
hey! i know its totally an offtop but there's a makeup company that recently launched REAL holo eyeshadows, at least they look like real holo on swatches. its a polish brand called Glam. i dont really know if they ship to canada, but you should definitely check them out :))
I love to watch your videos. Them are so funny and entertaining ❤️😂❤️
Just me waiting for a launch of socks... it will be called cozy taco
I won't be shocked until someone steals footage of her HAIR
4:07 Artists have the same problem 😫
Kinda like how you took this idea from  H3 podcast...... lol im kidding but its funny.
“I have binders of affidavits”... the (orange) SHADE of it all... 😂🤣
The post u didn't understand is an algerian Instagram page and its said there's a new nails art printer 😂😂
can't wait to apply for your next school grant thing. C0VID HAS BEEN HARD AND I'M NEARLY 30 and toronto is expensiveee. I just want to learn things and finish my Masters. LMAO
so earlier when I was on insta and thought hey those look like Cristine's nails/nail art the probably were ? that is nuts....
Christine, you just gotta start putting watermark all the way across the video in a diagonal across your face. And same on thumb mail lol
hmm seems like mirror chrome is super popular. would be a shame if holo taco stole their customers by making its own  ;)
Is it just me or does she look younger? Lol 😂👌🏻👌🏻
In the Spanish part they are basically calling you a white girl lmao
Cristine I have something to show. We all where looking for some REALHOLO makeup : here is an answer ! https://glam-shop.pl/pol_m_KOSMETYKI-GLAM_pigmenty-_PERLY-HOLO-197.html
how can someone dislike this video? people confuse me so much. thank you for this video.
Thank you for doing this! so few people are aware or actually care about artists work being stolen online. You rock!!!!!
I was at a nail salon and they had a picture of your nails but in the salon we weren’t allowed to have phones out
Anyone else get a creepy loud lacquer ad?
#Thankmas https://youtu.be/YfJ_ptCTLms
.... She's using a sledgehammer as a gavel
That was not Spanish
And you’re stealing the idea of content court from H3 productions
THIS IS REAL PEOPLE
The fact that you know Shania Twain’s “imma gethca good” just makes me want to binge watch your videos even more❤️❤️
"It's a quick turnaround buck." My nana used to say that. lol (I'm a fellow Canadian). I always link to the influencers products too if they have that product or their merch too.
Here's a tip: Don't buy from ads.
The urban dictionary is correct. Gringas can be meant to be mean but not all the time. I live in south Texas. 😊
Ok so I found your podcast in spodify and listened to all of it in a few days. Then today, this video was on my recommended and it’s you!! I was like “uh o remember hearing her voice” and I just put 2 and 2 together and realized it’s you!!
It means the new  sensation between the girls in us... you are not a gringa because you are canadian🇦🇷
I love how nobody in the comments has questioned the holo hammer.. like obviously Cristine has a holo hammer, what did you expect🙄😂😂
Someone, please, tell her that's portuguese, not spanish and gringa it means "foreigner girl/women", it doesn't mean white girls! #SimplySlanglogical
Please support #thankmas.
Its not Spanish, It's Portuguese! It's a Brazilian company!  haha
Sorry, but once I saw $91.00 for the rainbow , i realized i was broke(;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)
On a non-nail related subject, what are your thoughts on the Great Reset and The New World Order? Your Prime Minister has spoken about it, our Australian government has voted on it. Its no longer a conspiracy..
Oh no she said brazilians speak spanish ooooh nooooo    (We speak portuguese btw)
Cristine should go to one of those salons and ask for her thumbnail to be recreated on herself 😂😂and see if they recognize their nails
The SAME EXACT poster for dip powder is in my nail salon. When I brought it up to the woman doing my nails (the owner of the establishment) she said didn't know anything about it and she didn't even know who simply nailogical was. I think there is a bigger scheme going on here like someone who does marketing is selling these posters to nail salons to make a profit... very interesting!!!!
Are they like not embarrassed by stealing? Especially when they try to claim it as their own, I mean lazy much? It pisses me off honestly
I so badly want some of ur nail polish but I'm afraid it's too expensive  this is called me being cheap
I called out a company for using an influencer’s video of another product, and they deleted my comment. So I wrote another one, and another one, and another one. Hehehehe...
affidavits davits sounds like david david as in david tea!
A dude revolutionized chocolate by making it holo!!!!!! https://youtu.be/yhmCRliJ93w
wait are we using a mallet as a gavel? idk if i love or hate it
From content court to simply court... Love seeing my favorite podcasters crack down on these internet criminals!! 🤣  Also, there’s a Christine (yes, with an H) from And That’s Why We Drink podcast who was a private investigator haha. That would be an interesting collab. 😁💜 Okay bye.
I hope you’re suing in real life.
PAINT MEENCHUE NAILS RN‼️‼️‼️😂
Gringa or gringo is a person that is not from Latin America, not a bad thing just an outsider
It’s portuguese 😂😂😂😂
6:06 is just a marketing about a ""new foreign product"" to Brazilians
I keep thinking about nova saying you sound like Jenny from the original Sabrina the teenage witch......    You’re welcome for reminding you
OMG, Exhibit C is in Arabic.. It says "Latest nail technology which is a printer that paints on any picture you have on your phone on your nails within 35 seconds. Exclusively and only in Algeria" I loled so hard
Gringo is slang for American man as in military - “green go” and the female equivalent slang is gringa. The taco reference is because Americans like cheese on their tacos so the gringa taco is a Mexican street taco with shredded cheese lol
#Thankmas #CallToAction https://youtu.be/YfJ_ptCTLms
Does every north american thinks all latin america speaks spanish?
“i don’t know spanish” girl that’s Portuguese
its portuguese not spanish 😢 2 different languages
Ucuuuuuggghhhh I hate unethical companies!
"Calling out some brands stealing my polish* Wish has left the chat
the arabic says: "the latest in nail beautifying technology, it's a printer that will print any picrure you have on your phone in 35 seconds. only available in Algeria"
Ad in Portuguese: *exists* Cristine: i can’t read Spanish  Portuguese language: am I a joke to you?
I’d like to discover what if I buy the oil pen...what is the real product!?
hey cristine, so the one you didn't understand a word is a brazilian ad using your face to promote poligel nails. the translation tô the firsr frase would be something like "the newest trend among foreigners" (if my speeling is bad i'm sorry I am brasilian and speak portuguese) much love! 💕
Beyyyn: are you hammering something down here? Cristen: just companies who steal my stuff! Me: surprised cat meme Also me: she forgot to say that one of them were stealing his nails and face!!!!
Cristine: "I can't read Spanish" The ad, in Portuguese: "Am I a joke to you?"
Deak the halls with holo falslalalala lakalalalaa tus the season of minche and Zyler merch falalalaaa lalala! Sorry for the grammar errors-
Irish potato man said "inform your favorite creators" so im informing my favorite nail artist :D https://youtu.be/YfJ_ptCTLms  It would be really nice if you helped 💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿💿
Cristine omg your pronunciation is so good (gringa) 😂😂😂😂 That was portugués not Spanish lol
Cristine: Turn that red button green! Also Cristine: Wait- it doesnt turn green it turns gray! -ew. Me: I wish you could make it turn holo 😃🌈💿  edit: PS sorry if i spelled your name wrong.... :(
I found out what exhibit d meant by sticking it in google translate and this shit says “The latest technology for manicure is a printer that paints any image you have on the phone on your nails in a period of 35 seconds. ...  Exclusively and only in Algeria  Ecleky on Lavotou, the official page of this printer will bring you out”  Hope I was helpful for once
I'm 4 days late, but dang, Cristine looks gorgeous!
Subtitles said: 'simply no logical snails'
We Latinos have a blast whenever people from other countries try to understand our slang. You can't imagine how excited I was to see your reaction to "Gringas" but I must clarify: It's not used in a mean way, we are all from mixed heritage so we are in no position to use derogative names
6:19 spa-spanish? that's portuguese
WAIT. SHE SHOULD DO A SIMPLYNAILOGICAL MARATHON AND WATCH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF HER VIDEOS IN ONE SITTING.
Cristine that's portugueeeese!
The shipping of your products to germany costs 20€ wtf i dont pay 20€ shipping for a 10€ nailpolish
they're too obsessed with your seggy nails 😩
7:22 is not spanish, what the fuck!? I can't really read that, so my guess is it's portuguese.   But gringa is both used to refer to those kind of quesadillas/tacos (whatever they are) and to refer to women from the US specifically. At least in México. What I've heard, from the misleading predecesors, is that it came from the war times or some shit, someone heard they would say "Green, go!" to them, so... gringo.  And I don't know if it's like a slur, at least I and the people I know don't use it like that, it's more of a common term for the people who call themselves americans, as if it wasn't the whole damn continente. But everything is mean, offensive and derogatory these days, so it might as well be...  Edit for some typos
love the holo taco gavel. Also   "Paint thy nails" "In Holo we trust"  Literally made me spit out my water
Oooooo,  look who's skin is clearing up! Good for you friend 😊
The one at 10:44 kinda looks like photoshop
this made me so mad
me knowing all the videos
your hair >>>>> everything
“To white girls” even though the definition clearly says not related to race lmao
"a nove febre entre as gringas"
"Can't read spanish" It literally said Brasil HAHAHAAH
Go to a salon that has one of your pictures up, ask for exactly the nails on that picture. Would be priceless.
Gringo or gringa is used to refer white people specially who lives in USA; gringo= white boy, gringa= white girl. This term is used in Latin America, and no, is not very offensive its the same thing as saying Chinese to a Chinese people so...
That ain’t Spanish 😂
Sis that ain't Spanish das Portuguese lmfao, but gringa is also used by latin countries to mean white people.  Not derogatory just slang :)
DANG I STRAIGHT UP KNOW WHERE THE NAIL SALON WITH THE DIP NAIL WALL IS ITS LIKE AN HOUR FROM MY HOUSE LOUISIANA WTH
Exhibit C is written in Arabic and its an ad for the thing your holding in the picture
maybe that color changing pigment is what caused your skin issues :o
She didn't know it was  Portuguese because its very similar to  Spanish
You should go to one of those salons with your stolen picture and ask for exactly that
The Arabic one was basically saying “we’re gonna print whichever image you want on your nails”.
imagine if a salone would say: Here simplynailogical does ur nails for 10 bucks
It was not Spanish it was Portuguese
It’s the holo hammer ? And u go to holo jail .
I think you need to watermark over anytime you have your nails up
Omg I missed u I got midnight for my bday
That one company that used your face and spoke in "spanish", didn't speak in Spanish, but in Portuguese.
They didn’t even crop out ben’s picture lol 😂
simply vlog logical?
7:30 Exhibit c written in Arabic it says : the latest technology for nails. Print any picture from your phone on your nails in 35 seconds. Now available only in  Algeria
That's Portuguese not Spanish And "gringa" can be mean deppending on the context, but there was like "american", in a way to validate the product. Brazilians are obsessed with foreign products
This frustrates me so deeply
Your holo and awesome
so much polish
“The Spanish post” is not Spanish is actually Portuguese
😂 so pure looking for the definition of gringa, but we mostly use it with people from the states
A gringa mean a white lady in mexico
The one that used your face the nails are another youtuber i fogot her name
Pay artists for their content/creativity!
You should do a collab with Brad Mondo and let him do your hair! He certainly has ideas!
It happens so much in the beauty industry, drives me mad. I fell victim to a company selling copycat lipglosses and it was like wow ok, the product is still usable but the box is riddled in typos. You guys sure put a load of effort in to this 🙄🙄
i don't think gringa is mean. it can still be used meanly. but like my friends and teachers call me gringa. and it's not like they could get away with it.
Your hair looks extra nice today
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6p3T_KHbfhs  Holo Chocolate
HOLO THERE! Omg that was an AD from my country Brazil! I feel ashamed hahaha  It means "the new hottest trend among gringas (women outside Brazil)" gringa is just a slang, but it doesn't mean something bad (well not at least around me) just someone who lives outside of Brazil.
i love that she's using a mallet as a gavel
Holo there
The dislikes are all the people who stole her content
basically the ad says “popular among white people” LOL
That moment when she recognized Ben's hands on the spot.. 😂
Coming from someone who uses the slang word “gringa” as a native word, always asume it’s the urban dictionary meaning lmao  pd. a fun fact about “gringa (f)/ gringo (m) comes from the phrase “green go”
So... that´s not Spanish, it´s Portuguese hahah
I love that as she’s trying to speak Spanish she sounds like she’s speaking French🤣🤣
That’s not Spanish😂
Exhibit B is in Portuguese, and gringa means white girl.
7:28 reads: Technology’s latest feature on nail polish 💅🏻 it’s a printer that copy’s any picture from ur phone to ur nails ❤️🇩🇿 in a span of 35 second, only in Algeria.  Edit: For anyone wondering it’s Arabic.
That's not Spanish, it's Portuguese. And the Spanish perspective gringo/gringa/gringe is like person that speak English and its not necesarily mean bit can be used to be like..."gringos again" as like complaining about us citizens again, but also regional differences and stuff
My name is Amaya 😂
YES BRING OUT THE BAN HAMMER
Gringa is used everywhere here in latinomerica for US people, it is not mean!! that being said, it can definitely be mean lmao depends on the tone. But I have a cousin who is all white, blonde and green eyed and we used to call him gringo lol
I feel like this will go viral, but not like baby shark viral sooo...  If this has gone viral i called it      ..                    It probably won't...

the one is arabic says word for word : "latest nail beauty technology. printer that draws any image on your phone to your nails in 35 seconds. only and exclusibely in Algeria.  Click the photo for the official page for the printer"   they are basically local... "resellers". they acquire chinese  and foreign products cheaply somehow then resell them locally at markups for people who dont have like credit cards and stuff.
THATS NOT SPANISHHH
Cristine you should really do harry styles's nailsss please i would be blessedd 😢
At 7:29 it was in arabic, I know how to read Arabic so it translates to  “The latest thing that came to manicure technology which is a printer that draws you any image you have on  IPhone on your nails in 35 seconds ... Exclusively and only in Algeria”
6:17 that was portuguese from brazil
Please review the - Born Pretty 3-layers thermal gel polish!😊
The music when Cristine writes "exhibit" is the sound of the podcasts I listen for Uni... I can't express how much I stressed when I heard it the first time
6:15 "I can't read Spanish" Me, spanish: that's not Spanish 😂😂😂😂😂
I always ask salons in Nz if they have heard of you x Only because I wanna use your products.  .  Do you ship to Nz???
where are their menagers? I want to speak with them
The second one I just seen it on pinterest. Just the nails and no face or audio.
I am so glad you didn't buy any of those products! Don't feed into that. Screw those people.
That for sure was not spanish...
I might just be trippin but cristine looks so different here and i cant figure out whyyyyyy!
It isn't spanish It's PORTUGUESEEEEEE Gringa/grinco It's how we call anyone that's isn't brazilian
when she said that brazilian video was spanish...... sad vibes.......
This is why people make the water Mark bigger CHRISTINE..!!.!✨💙🥰🖤🤣😂 Lu U tho.💓💓⚡️🙂
I mean we all know people rudely STEAL Cristines content ...but to steal BEN??!?!?! BEYYYYNNN?!?! What the heck?!
I saw someone literally put their watermark on their fingers and people still used it without credit
2,000 yrs Ago Jesus Died on the cross 4 our sins and rose 3 days later . The 10 commandments r the moral law. We broke God’s law and Jesus Paid the fine. That’s what happened on that cross . B4 he died he said it is finished . If u got a stack of speeding fines n Sb pay your fines off they can let you go which is legal and rite . Your like a man on a plane thousands of ft in the air and your gonna flap ur arms to save ur self n I say no trust the parachute. Transfer your trust from yourself In2 the Savior bc u Dont Kno when your gonna die . Repent n Trust In Jesus 2 b Saved . John 3:16 n Romans 10:9 God Bless💜🙏🏽
Now we need socks merch 👀
Wish does the same thing. My mom is a photographer and her friend who’s also a photographer got her picture stolen and the woman IN the picture found out and wish deleted the item because it was going viral. They steal a lot of pictures. Idk why people do that. Like they could google or just use their own product on themselves. They could even use a different companies product then say the outcome was their product. It’s still incredibly fucked up, but they won’t be stealing other creators’ work.
No❤ stop✋🏻stealing💰 her💁🏻‍♀ nail's 💅🏻 also gringa or grigo means both things
I bought the same mug from David’s tea before they went out of business :(
I'm sorry Cristine, but that video of polygel isn't spanish, it's portuguese, brazilian portuguese actually 🤦🏻‍♀️ I love you but don't switch us
Christine 2017 coming to an end thank God      But look at this year with 2020 coming to an end thank god
The gringas comment had me screaming
I LOVE YOU CHRISTINE
Exhibit c is in arabic. It says  " the latest trend in nail technology, The machine that prints any photo from your cellular onto your nails in 35 seconds. Click on the photo to get redirected to the official page and follow it"
I saw a other artist(who makes painings) who had a stamp on both his hands, so others won't steal his video's
You need to start suing
That's why with some content of my photo's id throw my watermark completely across the image and transparent it
There's a possibility the salon searched "dip powder nails" or something along those lines and your thumbnail came up in google images. Not excusing the theft, but they probably weren't even aware it was a YouTube thumbnail.
00:53 love the subtle jab at American politics
Hey u should be proud of it lol I know stealing is not good but ur so great at it that they love it and they just want to have the same views or nails or people buying their products lol 😂 by the way I love ur videos that imma steal this one n post it on Facebook just kidding god bless you hope you fix this n yah stop stealing people not ok lol 😂 I love watching videos of nail art I'm also practicing too
Hey Cristine you should try and make some k-pop related nail art (if u still do nail art i guess?)Btw love your videos!💜
CRISTINE HUHUHU I NEED THAT HOLO CHOCOLATE 🤣🤣🤣🤣
When she read the word “gringa” I legitimately spit out my drink oh my god jfjdhdhfhdhffddd
6:40  Guuuuurl, that's not Spanish... it's Portuguese!
did she say nails as snails in the beginning???
A case well-presented to the crown by Nailogical at Law
Every ottawa resident knows that one booth at Bayshore with a picture of Christine’s nails 😂
ok but you looks STUNNING. glowing girl!!
Gringa or gringo is derogatory term for a white person. it would kind of be like someone calling me a guido because I'm Italian. Its not a very nice slang word for us
Earrings looking like the virus chip from Zenon
Holotaco socks! I would buy it! 🧦
Koh the face stealer ain’t got nothing on Instagram “company” ads
Definitely seen this on wish
I've seen facebook ads about snap on veneers (looked into a certain brand before) using videos from usually small creators on YouTube, who are reviewing a totally different brand. They'll take clips from videos I've seen. I once commented to call them out and the next time I saw that ad, my comment was gone 😂 But all the other comments from before were still there.
NO WAY!! I TOOK ONE OF THOSE PHOTOS AT THE SAME PLACE,  BUT SOMEONE ELSE TWEETED IT!! that is crazy!
Gringo is (at least for me, in Argentina) someone that talks english but like from england...? Because we call people from usa yankees (shanquis ?)
are u ok ? u look kind of tried
Lmfaoo gringa means “white girl”
Cristine! Check out the How to Cook That channel for a recipe for true holo, fully food safe holo chocolate!!! 💿🍫💿
I almost wonder if these shops didn’t go to her thumb nail for it but someone else already cropped it and they just look up a photo to use and they have no clue
6:44 It's Portuguese.  Not cool that you got ripped like that. Oddly complimentary,   though.
The second video is in Brazilian portuguese , not in spanish. And Gringa means foreign , normally from US or argentina . They are trying to sell some kind of a nail gel  🤣 it's a fever here in Brazil those kinda of nails
I’m from Argentina!
6:18 it's not spanish, that's portuguese
I saw a strapless bra ad on facebook and one of the girls in the video is from Troom Troom. They took a clip of the Troom troom video about braless bra look.
Who is gonna tell her 👀 that is portuguese not spanish 😂
Argentina haciendo presencia 😂
I really respect that she blurred out the company name and everything. She is the “victim” here yet she is being nice/respectful and preventing hate! This is why we love you ❤️ you’re so pure!
Petition for overnight mint choco oats 👇👇👇
I can hear the sound of brazilian screaming over the "I can't read spanish" lol
I'm sure the company that is distributing the dip nails products is probably supplying the salons with free posters for advertising stuff.
I just realized how much she looks like my mom omg
If I get anything holographic or duochrome it's for the eyes...and I buy it on etsy so at least I know it goes to a person who works hard to make it themselves. It's better this way....
When she still has the first generation Apple headphones 😂😂 I always get a good laugh out of these videos
I just love how the dip powder thumbnail the salons used had a question  mark at the end like "dip powder nails *?*" Like are they even dip powder?????
I CAN'T READ SPANISH JSADHJAKDH
Cristine! An Reardon recently made holographic chocolate. It sounds fake but you can find her videos on YouTube
that's..... Portuguese though......
Gringa means basically like “American” or non Latina so that would translate to a new trend among foreigners/Americans
I feel like the thumbnails are misleading but it's an advertisement, it does also confuse me like how hard is it really to take their own cute photos.
Christine how are your eyes doing
Cristine, I don't wanna be that person but as your resident Mexican around here: that's not Spanish, that's Portuguese.
U have the shiny pillow as me (Its the green and blue to black pillow)
Considering so many people are using your stuff, that’s actually a compliment to your incredible talent in making videos😁👍 BUT THEY SHOULD STILL PAY YOU FOR USING THEM, JERKS!😠👎
we stan 😩
Momma's angry and we're here to support her
Hi Cristine, I'm Brazilian and the "gringa" ad is in portuguese. So translating it would something like: "The newest cool trend among foreign women" Gringa can be a bad thing depending on ythe way you say it, but it can literally means foreign, so it's not always a bad thing. It can be fancy, as it's not local... Hope it helps
Somehow, stealing BEYNN feels like the worst offense. Seems even more invasive than the shot from her office.
That was Portuguese Cristine lol
Is it sad that Simply could easily make this a series.
Simply 6:30 thats not spanish 😅
The salon ones like why not just print your url there 😂 if they admire your work at least give credit what even
Just started the video and already love that there’s a brazilian add using her pictures!
6:18 CRISTINE THATS NOT SPANISH 😂
I didn't think so many brazilians watched Cristine's videos too
Hi I am Brazilian! “Febre entre as gringas” means a trend among foreigners (I don’t know if you could understand) but it’s not offensive, it’s more of an admiration. Like people that are not from Brazil hahaha
Gringa is just foreigner
SUE ALL OF THEM!
They call her Gringa and she isn't even from U.S, she is canadian LOL. By the way that is not spanish is portuguese.
the literal photo of ben in the nail oil ad is too damn much lmao
6:18 it's portuguese, i can´t speak portuguese either, since i only speak spanish, english and a bit of korean, but, i did see the word "gringas", which, if it means the same thing it means in spanish, they said that it is the new fashion al american women are doing, they didn't even know you're canadian lmao
Cristine, do you ever use a custom tumbler? Or anything made of resin? Earrings, necklaces, glasses, anything like that?  Because I was thinking about how your allergic reactions look so similar to resin reactions. Resin products are so common these days but despite that, resin is toxic. It’s not body safe and people who are extremely sensitive to things as is tend to be more prone to a reaction. Just an idea.
Random thought/admission. I love watching Cristine but also love watching cooking shows... every time a cooking show says the word “bake” my brain says “Bayke dat s*** fora min it” 😂
My favorite is the nail salon that used dip powder nails but it has a question mark so it’s like they don’t even know if they do dip powder
6:13 yeah is 100% shitty that people use your face without permission but cmon the “calling Portuguese Spanish” joke in 2020?
I loved the fact that she called these companies out,...BUT Cristine throwing shade at other youtubers is always such a delight.
Gringo (a) is a way to call Us people tho...
IMO the Portuguese was more so saying 'The newest foreign trend'? Or American trend? Usually when someone calls me Gringa it's used as 'Lil white girl' without much if any negative intent but the word itself can really be used to mean any native English speaker.
You are awesome!!! I do not color my nails, but I still think you are great!! (and sooo funny)
As I'm watching this I realize I've seen the silver mirror polish on Pinterest like a million times in the past week. Everywhere I scroll it's the same video of the mirror polish omg
Im so happy she didnt change on us or act different after starting her nail polish line!
7:33 that was in Arabc they were selling the printer i am pretty sure
I've called a few of in Facebook for using your footage without permission
I am so mad right now
I was lmao when I saw they used Ben's nails 😂
The salons that printed her thumbnails are the least worst of them all. 'Cus they probably just typed like "chrome nail art" on Google images and found the pictures of the thumbnails and printed. Not even realizing that it is a actually a YouTube video. I accidentally did that once with my small business.
at 4:56 the kup teraz gave me vinesauce joel flashbacks
You can see the watermark in the beginning of the first video as well.
I had no idea! Im glad i watched u .... Awesome info...
cristine: * looks up gringas * me: * laughs in mexican *
Its not spanish its portuguese
"I can't speak spanish"  *it's in portuguese*
You tell them sisterrrr edit: omg I didn’t realize you have been on here since 2014
I've heard that some people who do obviously fraudulent things on purpose because they are trying to target those most easily fooled. This is why even though the "Nigerian Prince" emails are still a thing despite being a well known scam, because it allows them to more easily filter out those who recognize the deception and repeated target those who are unaware. They are seeking the most vulnerable targets (this is not calling those scammed stupid, and those who have been did nothing wrong that someone took advantage of them)
6:18 that isn't spanish tho, its portuguese
WHAT A BUNCH OF COPYCATS!
WELCOME TO NAIL COURT!!!!!!!!!!!
Go get your money sis!!!
Wait......how can they sell Christine? SHE IS THE SOCK
As a member on the jury I recommend the death penalty
Question. Can I share this/other video on pinterest? (Copy the link and everything legal like that) is that okay? (I think it's is, just confirming)
Simply's Portal coloured nails though        ignore me im just a nerd on the internet
7:28 is in Arabic. It says:  Nail art printer, is the latest in nail technology, it will print any photo you have from your photo, on your nails in 35 seconds. Exclusive in Algeria “ Algeria, large, predominantly Muslim country of North Africa.” The people there are fluent in French.  Then they are advising us to click on the link which will direct us to the ordering page.  I am an Arab.
Baby that ain't Spanish, it's Portuguese. And yes, gringa is mean lmao
6:20 girl that's not even spanish, thats portuguese.  There is also a scam, where fake companies use your videos and photos, and other influencers  materials too, to sell products that clients pay and they never deliver. I have never fallen for it (I always buy from big sites like Amazon or Ebay or brazilian Mercado Livre) but I've seen people who have been victims of this. It's indeed a lost battle.
When “gringa” translates into something ‘bout tacos 😂 like of course HOLO TACO 🌮💅🏻
I’m puertorriqueño and for us “gringa” is like a mean word for a white girl.       That’s mean man
the instagram account of entre.nous.official is in arabic language basically they are explaining about the nail printing machine and unfortunately they stole your picture
THAT ISNT SPANISH IS PORTUGUESE  PLSSSS EVEN YOU....
Yes.
“I can’t read spanish” *Actually being portuguese*      Me: *Laughs in brazilian* Edit: the “gringa” thingy means someone who is from another country, (I think) so it basically means “cool people from usa use this nail polish, so buy it now”
I used to love her so much and now I hardly watch her because she never does nail art please do it again🥺
1:48 if they’re stealing pics of your feet, I am so sorry Cristine
“gringa” means someone from another country
Cristine, thats not spanish, is portuguese and its talking about how the gel trend is now trending on brasil
I have Pure Ice but even that isn't that chrome it's really old now though and it just chips lol. Going to have to toss it and get the actual chrome.
It would be hilarious if you went to the salons and were like WHERE DID YOU GET THAT IMAGE
Where is the problem if they use your videos or photos because ur work is perfect
Why is Cristine with a hammer more intimidating than it should be?
so no one is going to talk about simply having holo taco on YouTube cause I’ve gotten them and it makes me so happy I bought two kits and the nail file :)
alternate title: “Companies I’m currently sending a cese and desist”
"Ewww... Why?" 😂
Almost at 10 mil
“gringa” means foreign
Off topic of nails, but right as I took a sip of my tea, Christine called for a tea break and did the same. Yes, I am amused at the small things in life. It's been a crap year and you have to find something to smile about.
I know people have said this before, but I gagged when she said spanish....... hahahahahahah, Simply, its brazilian portuguese and you have many fans here so, don't ofend us..... (im jk so chill) ..... love uuu simply!!!
7:34 OMG THAT MY LANGUAGE HOW DEAR THEY USE YOU
cant tell if she has a spray tan or not
Are you here to steal BEEEEENNNNN
What? Nail salons in Argentina doing that?? Why am i not impressed. I see that all the time Edit: Now that I see it better, that place looks like a Falabella (A store with a lot of variety on products) It's very very close to my house.
when she said she didn´t speak spanish and it was actually portuguese she looked extra gringa
I want to see a reaction BUYING these items
Tan. 👙
Ok... someone please tell me where she got that mug... please...
PLZZZ that roughly translates to "the new fever amongst the white women" so. awwwwww
Cris u look so gorgeous omg
hi Cristine, so totally unrelated but be careful when you say you can't read spanish when it's actually portuguese, in Brazil we speak portuguese, not spanish and it's actually a common misconception but they're different languages. No shade to you at all, i love your content and companies don't have the right to steal your content but I just wanted to tell you that! love from Brazil!
"I can't read spanish" ARE YOU SERIOUS???
Everytime I watch her videos it makes me want to drink tea😅😅
it's not spanish :( 6:18
Video idea:  Have Beyyyynnn pick a random peelie out of the peelie bag and try to recreate it
cristine the suing queen yeah
Now they steal this vide exhibibition lol lol
I'm mad now 😠
At least she not buying from these companies to compare what they are telling to her stolen images.
When she said the verdict I feel like "Simply Guilty" would have been **chef's kiss**    Guess it was a simply missed opportunity 🤣
If only companies like Facebook and Instagram cared enough to actually remove the stolen content to begin, with when they get flooded with reports.
I live in Louisiana and I can confirm that dip nail powder pic is true and seen it multiple times in other business
Maybe the reason why they steal is because your production is so amazing.     And because they are lazy and want to make a quick buck too.
Honestly I’m so used to ur watermark that when it wasn’t there for like fifteen seconds, I was like “hmmmm somethin wrong here”
That was not Spanish 🤣🤣 it was Brazilian (PT-Br)
Cut your hair
Fucc em
"I cant read spanish" salaverga yo hablo español y tampoco le entiendo a esa mamada
BEEEENNNNNNNNN
I like how for the dip powder nails it says Dip Powder Nails?
GRINGA IS A TERM SOME SPANISH SPEAKERS USE TO INSULT WHITE GIRLS. Some say Gringa to say "white girl"
So annoying, because thumbnails take hours to make
Please go to some of this saloon and record It!!
Gringo/a means white person
How, just how, can 1.2k dislike this video? I'm baffled.
In Germany you should take a lawyer and sue the thieves.
A
translation to 7:33 ; the latest technology discovered in the field of nails beauty is a printer that prints any picture on your  phone on your nails in 35 seconds. Exclusively and only in Algeria.
i saw this happend with one make up company here where i live,where they sell fake make up, they took a pic from one ig make up artist that i follow and when i called them out they literally had the balls to reply and say 'these are real pics of our products, believe in what you want' /not exact same wordin bcs it happened like a year ago bit roughly this is what they said/ and deleted my comment.
U remind me of my aunt
It was portuguese, not spanish hehe bit is sad that this happens so often
Kinda off topic but I love seeing your holo taco ads on YouTube! Saw the first one and literally said “yes simply!!!”
Just one x 🤣
I’m dead they used Ben’s nails lmaooo
Translation of the PORTUGUESE part:  (not Spanish!)  -the new hot trend between foreigners, now in Brazil -the poligel longing (don’t know the real term but you got it ) now can be done at home - and promises big nails and resistant till 20 days! -guarantee your kit with free shipping -and win as a freebie a thing to dry your nails with UV rays (again, don’t know the right term sorry...)
Is it just me? Or does her hair look a lot better in this vid???
U look bootiful
You lookin like a snacc guuurlll 👌🏼 💁🏻‍♀️
Okay I know this is referring to one second of the whole video but if you do ever choose to cut your hair just know I will physically die if you don’t film it.
JUSTICE FOR BEN! The theft of his nails and likeness were not assessed in the final verdict! 👀
it'sportuguese brazilian, Cristine!!!!! NOT SPANISH
LMAOOOO @ binders of affidavits!!! I legit wanted to high-five my TV. (I watch YouTube on my TV.) Although, unlike those binders, or those $20K/day lawyers, or the 34 dismissed, dropped, or lost court cases, you actually had real, solid evidence.
You look like your sister in the thumnail
But if you DO want to see somebody publicly shame a company for using their pictures, please do go check out Bernadette Banner's video about a knockoff of her red medieval dress. Very funny, also educational, and Bernadette is lovely
It says "Brasil", Brazil does not speak spanish hahaha. Greetings from Colombia.
I want court room part 2...christine can u do that for me? 😌
im sorry, but it was so funny and interesting how people that are not familiar with spanish, portuguese or any other lenguage from the center or south America, get amaced for our slang. Of course it happen in both ways. Love you and your curiocity.
A latina here listening to her saying gringa is a taco got me chocking, to clarify it, gringa o gringo is a racial slur used by Latinos referring to a American
Cristine your skin is glooowing!
GRINGA LMFAOO NOOOO
gringa=white girl lol
The add at 7:32 is in arabic, well i should say its mostly in Algerian slang actually and i guess you tried translating it and google was as clueless as you were lol "The latest technologie in nail beauty, a printer that can draw any picture from you phone on your nails in less than 35 seconds ... exclusively in Algeria.  Click on the pic and subscribe to the official page of the printer"
re: Aliexpress... I am an artist who creates images used in crafting (like rubber stamps) and Aliexpress has stolen mine and a lot of other artist's works and are selling them on their site. You can send in a copyright claim but there's pretty much nothing else you can do if they decide they don't wanna do anything about it. For example, go search "girl clear stamps" and 90% of those images are from myself or artists I know who I know aren't the ones selling those or gave permission for their work to be used.
What kills me is I saw an ad for Holo Taco but it wasn't holo taco!!
Get yours here wait Ben or the nail pen. I WILL SUE YOU! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 IM DEAD
I love your videos BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE WHY DO ALL PEOPLE WHO HAVE ENGLISH AS A MOTHER LANGUAGE THINK PORTUGUESE IS SPANISH????
i’m cackling because it’s written NOW IN BRASIL and cristine is like “sorry i can’t read SpAnIsH”
You should definitely bring in pictures of your own nail art and ask these salons to recreate them lol
That's Portuguese, not Spanish! It even says Brazil on the ad. You're better than this, Cristine!!
The Brazilian Portuguese one..............
uwu part 2...?
It's not spanish, in Brazil we speak Portuguese. Pls
Omg!!!I seen a ad for holo toco😱🥳🥰
You should make a liquid mirror nail polish mountain
Hiya! The poligel ad is actually in portuguese, its from a brazilian company. "Gringa" is a slang for female foreigner. This is used since in Brazil customer's really like kissing ass of what people use in other countries. Lol
I love you Christine, but that's not Spanish, that's Portuguese xD
Cristine I love you but that’s not Spanish, it’s Portuguese...... why y’all always do the same mistake
Gringo doesn't mean anything bad, it just depends how it's said like many other words. It's commonly used by Mexicans and other Latinos to refer to white people from the United States. Some will use it to refer to other English-speaking white people, but that would be incorrect, so in Mexico, we use "Blanco(a)" which means white. Gabacho(a) is also used in Mexico to refer to white people from the US or things from the US. Mexicans also call the US, "Gringolandia".  btw the ad was in Portuguese.
Ì think the thumbnails appear in google search. It's still a stupid thing to just copy things randomly from google search, but I think that's why so many use the same ones. Like I said, still not saying its the right thing to do! Its absolutely horrible!
it was portugues nos spanish!!!! it literally said Brazil in the ad
I am an arabic speaker and the account entre nous is saying about a cool nail printer that prints any pic on your nails in 35 seconds
Cristiiineee, that is Portuguese from Brasil, not Spanish. Even when you put it on the google translator, it detects as Portuguese hahah Well, here goes the translation: The new trending between Americans just arrived in Brazil. The poly gel nail extensions now can be achieved at home. It guarantees long and resistant nails for up to 20 days. Get you kit with free shipping and receive a UV LED nail lamp for free.
Cristine hammering justice and some sense into the world
Pistolou porque chamaram de a nova febre das gringas kkkkkkkkkk
Hahahaha Gringo(masculine) or gringa(feminine) is for foreign people. Not just white people hahaha in Brazil at least
Simply go to 123go’s Snapchat, they made the 100 layers of nailpolish Challenge!!
that wasnt spanish, it was portuguese
Second evidence is actually in Portuguese, not Spanish
Ahhh I got a Holo Taco ad!!!! 😆😆 I didn’t know you guys made ads
hey simply! is your face feeling/getting better? you look wonderful in this video (not that you don’t always look wonderful). just noticeably glowey and smooth compared to complicated-allergic?-logical
"you wanna sell socks?"  me: nah fam i aint selling myself
Here's a translation for the Portuguese video you saw on instagram. "The new trend amongst female foreigners, now available in Brazil! Polygel nails can now be DIY'd at home, and can provide you long and lasting nails, until 20 days of use! Buy your free shipping nail kit and receive an UV light curing lamp as a freebie!" You're welcome.
Didn’t you suit Bath and Body Works? Maybe I made that up. Idk but Cristine, if you did.... I lost my favorite perfume bc of you 😝 JK JK... kind of.
That was not Spanish girl 😂
"I can't read spanish"  THAT'S PORTUGUESE  (Yeah gringo and gringa is how we call americans. Is not actually Stang tho)  (But you were right in the translation)
Cristine: " have no idea what's going on or what's been wirtten becasue I can't read spanish."  Me: *cries in portuguese*
"Gringas" is the feminine plural of "gringos", that's a term (sometimes in a derogatory manner, some other times not) in which latinos refer to the people from USA... But it can actually used in general for the people that speak english as mother tongue. The quote "a nova febre entre as gringas" is actually Portuguese for "a new fever in between the American girls"... Of course we know you're Canadian xD
Your hair looks real healthy here
It's portugueseeeee (from brazil👁️👄👁️)
Gringo is Spanish slang for Spanish non speaker. It’s not really mean.
gringa is someone from out of their country
Kinda curious to know what brad mondo would do to your hair
*Why you don’t upload weekly?* *Missed you* 🥺
I love how she literally has a fucking sledgehammer to use as a gavel😂😂
The nail salon ones, I'm wondering if someone just cropped it out and uploaded it somewhere, and then the nail salons googled a dip powder and just big printed. Maybe that's why that dip powder poster is so popular. Someone else could be selling it to the salons.
You gotta get passive aggressive with that watermark now. Have it move around in the video, make it a ton of different sizes, make a background with your watermark, and maybe even put it on your face with washable marker.
Christine ily, but the ad clearly said BRASIL, we dont speak spanish, we speak portuguese and its kinda offensive when people from other countries assume we speak spanish. just a heads up, great video tho, love ya!
if i dont look like this when i turn 35 i'm legally suiciding
is it just me or the music when she puts the exhibit make it so dramatic lol
I got a commercial of your nail polish when I was watching inside edition
That’s not Spanish 😂
🧐 This is crazy but... Maybe they thought you have moved on since your content isn't the same, just selling these days...💯 Nonetheless, there is no excuse for stealing, pretending or deceiving another to gain anything. I'm sorry this is what your going through...😞
*They copying my style, Copiana* 😳
the amaya one took down their post lmao
I hope they don't steal a pic or vid of your nail 😂 i love your vids so much 💖
You should cover your nails with your water mark then there covering the nails xx
6:21 that's portuguese HAHAHAAHAH
Have you tried contacting the salons and asking them to take your pictures down? I know for most things it isn't possible because they are overseas companies, but salons are accessible. I once messaged a salon because someone reposted their work on YouTube and monetized it
7:28 its says new nail art technology download any picture from your phone to your nails in 35 seconds only in Algeria
Gringos are people that speaks English and they are white
Thats isn't Spanish is like french
I'm arabic and exibit C was promoting the machine that prints out a design straight on your nails, you did a video trying it out. I'm literally embarrassed for every company that uses a person's face or nails or work without permission 🤦 you will get caught!! Especially when that person has fans all over the World!
whenever i have a bad day Cristine never fails to make me laugh and i love her so much
At the very very least they gave you a content idea :v
I'm actually really annoyed because I got the notification for this TWO DAYS late. And also these people really need to get creative and make their own pictures using their own product
I recognize the writing in exhibit C it's Arabic and it says: the latest technology for manicures a printer that draws any picture you have on your phone in 35 seconds exclusive and only in Algeria
Wait up! Gringo and gringa are not mean, that's just a way to say "foreign person"... oh and not only for english speakers, actually is for every foreign. Also, it's Brazil's Portuguese, not Spanish hahaha
For the salon images, it looks like that nail dipping powder company was using that thumbnail as advertisements that they gave them.
I just know something worst ever happened today( beside someone stole her nail) someone unsubscribed her using my account and I didn't get the notification for her new videos... So I'm late..
Black Monday deals?? Bogo🤯😳😳☺
Someone may be selling those posters to unsuspecting shop owners
Shania Twain is my most favourite singer.
Omg it’s so easy to do nails and take a picture from their phones and PRINT IT!! Why do they have to steal other people’s work??
It's not Spanish it's Portuguese.
Me and my homies boycott brands that steal content 😠 ly simply 🙏
The woman lives an a country that speaks French but CAN'T recognise PORTUGUESE
Yes, Cristine, gringa is pejorative and it's being used in an AD because people use pejorative terms in nail ADs 🤓
I wish I had the money to buy your high quality nail polish 😟
Back in the days where I used to make lots of pics for Tumblr, a guy reposted one of them with the watermark removed and his own name put on it. I asked if he could give me credit for making it and he said that I couldn't prove that I did... So I sent him a picture of me with the PSD file with all the layers 😅 surprisingly he didn't reply after that lol
CriStiNe- DiD yOu gET a gLoW uP       it's that or i haven't watch you in awhile 👁️👄👁️
I CAN'T READ SPANISH LOLLLL 💀💀💀💀💀💀
love you girl been watching you since i was 12 now im 16 sooooooo i guess 4 years i was actually diagnosed with cancer when i was 14 and my treatment is 2 and a 1/2 years long i finish in 9 months and you have brought some joy to my depressing world thank you so so so so so sooooooooooooo much for being the amazing and funny person you are, i think i can say this on behalf of all your fans (we will all back you up no matter what!!!!!!!)
I haven't come across anything here but I'll keep my eyes on the look out
The title just sounds really painful to me😂😂
Cristine: I can't read spanish  Me: that's not spanish!!
It’s not Spanish it’s Portuguese 😆 love you though🤩❤️
it would be interesting to see someone purchase a couple of these products and show us what they actually receive lol
uh simply gringo means stupid in Spanish jckjfclkfdnckjdnckdjsnckn I CANT-  BAHHHAHAHAHAHAH (also its Portuguese *no hate i have been watching you since 2016*
I do have a salon near me that has a catalogue for picking nail art and it has some pictures of yours and a bunch of other youtubers. But they leave the watermarks, and have a little thing underneath each one with your screen name and your link, the type of thing you do on YouTube, and some little description that says stuff like, “while our work will never be exactly like Cristine’s we use a similar method to her tied and true etc”. I never really thought about if them doing that without your permission was jerky or not.
Thank you for not buying the fake products. Whenever influencers make these videos, it always seems counterproductive...
As a latina it was funny to watch christine try to figure what gringa meant 😂😂
Nail-fishing  Catfishing but for nails. I see a lot of people confuse Portuguese with Spanish. Coming from someone who speaks a bit of Español. I had some random stranger using my profile picture to catfish 2 times and the page got taken down the other day. This is why I keep all my pages private. Also that's art theft if you use someone's selfie/nail-fie without their permission..
I love how cristine wants to sue them because she thought they were selling ben 😂 but doesnt want to sue them for using her thumbnails, face etc.
The text *clearly in portuguese" Cristine: I don't speak spanish
Just curious, could companies buy a picture, thumbnail or sth from you  Cristine,  to just use to decorate the salon? If it's pretty and a store probably would pay a bit to get a nice canvas print, if there was an option?
I haven't been here in so long I'll be visiting more often
Why wouldn't they ask first?
آخر ما وصلت له تكنولوجيا تجميل الاظافر ، و هي طابعة ترسم لك اي صورة لديك في الهاتف على اظافرك في مدة 35 ثانية  This is arabic if u want to under stand what they said in the add put this in google translate
7:28 it's saying: one of the last achievements of technology a nail printer that will print any photo you want from your phone on your nail just in  35 seconds,  clique on the photo qnd follow the officiel page that sells them .
I just realized you're one of the few things that have been stable in my life for a long time! x) Your videos are keeping up with the quality since I was 12
You should go to one of the shops and say where did you get that poster from???!!!! 😳 lol
SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIMPLYYYYYYYYY-Hi (luv u <3)can pls do a polygel reviev/tutorial? I've been seeing polygel all over my ig and im rlly  considering buying it it would be rlly cool if u could try it  :D
Me: *sees video* also me: *spill the tea sis*
Your skin looks happier and healthier! I hope you're doing well
So easy to reverse Google image these salon pictures to find the business though lol
Why did I get a diaper ad from your video🤣
exhibit C that shows in 7:28 is in Arabic and it says, the latest technology in nail beauty! It's a printer that would print any photo from ur phone into ur nails in 35 seconds! exclusive and only available in Algeria!
I’m getting some holo taco one coat black and scattered holo taco for Christmas. I absolutely can’t wait to finally try it!
Here's an idea. Go to one of the salons. Get your OTHER hand done by them then Redo it yourself. And see who done it better (obviously simply does it better)
Am I the only one that has been waiting for this video?! 😜
*Gets nervous because my last name's Amaya*......  I didnt do it, I swear lol
Y'ALL! IT'S NOT A HAMMER IT'S A MALLET!
I lost it when they literally showed a picture of Ben in the background 💀
Oh wow that is so much theift, from you and your one of my favorite content creators
Cristine : I guess I’ll stop banging this now Also Cristine : *continuously banging the table*
Idk what to fcous on, the rubber mallet  shes using as a gavil or the earphones from 2005
LMAO "THEY HAVE MY FOOTAHE, MY NAILS, AND MY VOICE!?" Advert: "STAY COOL! Cool Ranch Doritos"  😂
You should see the amount of "before and after" weightless images that are stolen!
crazy ive been watching you since i was about 12 and now im almost 18. its been a wild few years x
Simply : chill about companies using her content. Companies : Brings in Ben Simply : Oh now you've done it. I'll sue you
Omg 😱 I have the BEST idea! THE SUBSCRIBE BUTTON SHOULD TURN HOLO!
Probably already mentioned by others, but the same thumbnail being used in multiple locations possibly means it's probably a dodgy wholesaler that's selling the image to these salons.
Hey Christine!!  Tha ad that said gringa is actually from Brazil!! And from a perspective of an actual Brazilian (me lol) gringa it’s not offensive is just a lingo to refer to people who speak english!!! Love ya!!
The dip powder nails thumbnail is on the first page of Google images. I feel like those salons either were lazy in making their own images, or just didn't know how to do it so they stole yours lmao.
How do 1.1K people dislike a video literally exposing thieves and disgusting lying companies. I don’t see what is an issue here.
if you go down a path of crime, you’ll eventually just get your statistics analyzed
The video she couldn't read was Brazilian and written in portuguese. Just to make it clear, "gringa" ia definitely not an offensive word here, it's just an expression to say "a non-brazilian girl", she could be any race, from anywhere as long as she's not Brazilian I know they got the "gringo" expression in other places too, but this is what it means HERE ON BRAZIL Ok, bye 💖 P.S.: actually, saying something is "a nova moda entre as gringas" here is mostly used to say it's something chic, or expensive
~ petition to make the subscriber button green ~
Shania Twain never authorizes anyone to use her music.
Gringa is white girl😃
Gringa is american girl in spanish
You should do an updated polish mountain with all the HaloTaco polishes!
Exhibit B is in Portuguese, just saying
I like that your closing statement was actually the verdict. Still a better lawyer than Rudy Giuliani
Not Spanish... Portuguese. In Brazil people speak Portuguese.
🍵
I'm amazed no company has stolen pictures of your hair yet?
7:12 It depends on the context, in that case was just to picture you as an English speaker ('though it's more used to call like that the people from USA)
In 7:29 it says : The last thing nail polish technically arrived to is this printer which print any picture you want on you phone on your nails in 35 seconds, click and you will see the tag of the account selling it   It is Arabic language and i am a native speaker of it so my translation is 100% accurate
Wish is the worst about this. Ive seen simply, manny, jeffery, nicol and countless others
Hehe that's portuguese, not spanish! 😝😹💖 Love from Argentina! 🇦🇷💜
This is giving me major James Charles Teddy Fresh vibes 😭
I love that she knows and listens to Shania Twain
Yes, hello. I'd like to order one Ben please.
The day I found this video and ad for the new holo taco was playing
The nail salon thing makes absolutely no sense to me. Why wouldn't you just take pics of your own work? The salon is really that bad?
The thumbnails in salons could be that they googled images of dip powder nails (not that it’s right as that is still stealing content)
Gringo is a slang for foreigner, it's not a bad thing. 😂
6:17 thats... that’s not Spanish
At the point... I am just curious about WhO HaS ThE CoPyRiGhT To ThIs ViDeO??
simply:order in the cor... oooo look at how big that poster is how did they print that out ANYWAY me: this is why i subscribe
It is Portuguese not Spanish.
Now I wanna get a Holo Taco mallet/gavel lol
6:19 that’s portuguese, not spanish
You should get a finger tattoo so no one can stealth your handa
Like for her to go dumpster diving!!
cristine falando português é tudo pra mim (its not spanish lol its portuguese, pls dont mix it up)
6:20 that isnt spanish, its portuguese from Brasil 🙃
@simplynailogical, if a bunch of shops all have the same posters of your thumbnail printed out, then my guess is they’re getting them from a retailer, nail marketing company or chain discount nail supply.
Omg the poly gel video is in portugués lol not Spanish
Lmao this sucks... I’m sorry people (*cough cough* dumba$$e$ *cough cough*) are stealing your pics and content and... face(?) I think it would be funny tho if you went and commented on the posts yourself like “haha funny how I don’t remember giving permission for my nails to be here.”... no? Okay well... um... just ignore me 😅😅
Noooo that’s not Spanish
the second video was in PORTUGUESE NOT SPANISH.
I really love your videos..❤️❤️ I wish I could meet you..m
In Texas gringa/gringo means white person. ...so "The new fever among white girls." lol
Im glad she didnt buy hate when people buy scam shit like 'dont buy this!'
the whole time I was thinking what would LegalEagle find as the $$amount in fines
I feel like I need to print off some of these thumbnails and put them on my desk  where I do my nails and make up.
Well. Now I need to have a simply thumbnail poster in my room
The audacity to do this
This just means you need to be a hand model
Actually with the salons is a little harder to get a case cause they got this image out of google probably not knowing who created it.
Simply: I don’t know what is says I don’t speak Spanish  Me: THATS NOT SPANISH (atleast the one I know wich is Mexican) Yes there are different Spanish I speak fluently castellano :) Btw simply yes gringa is what you call a girl that speaks english here in Latin America more known as Mexico  For example ME I’m American but also Mexican sooo I’m considere gringa ;-;
I know you cant read spanish bc is not spanish  HAHAHAHAH
Exhibit b is portugues and gringa is for American-white girls but yeah i think its a brazilian company lol
morning from Campbell River, Vancouver Island, bc Canada you go girl, we love yall very much. My wifey Joe and myself think you are the best,
Brasil representando bem
"Gringo" means white foreign peaple in Brazil (and also brazilian native people that are white/have blue or green eyes/blond hair).
Is she pregnant ??? She’s glowing and looks sooo different !!!
Omg even in Brazil! In 6:13 it says that you can get gel stretching (like, I mean this fake nails thing) on nails at home not using other products. (And thats portuguese not spanish)
6:20 NOT SPANISH.............cristine that's portuguese i swear to good...brazil i'm devastated
7:23 it means the new fever among women from other contrys, most of the times we refer at nothern amemican ones.🇧🇷❤
6:39 loved seeing you try to speak portuguese, live from Brazil 🇧🇷❤
In Brazil, gingas isn't mean, it just means girls from outside Brazil, from the US/Europe, it's even supposed to be 'cool'. So it meant the new trend , something cool coming from the US ;)
Is it me or does she look a lot better like mentally? Idk maybe it’s just the hair being down and not up in a bun 😂😂
lmao gringa comes from gringo, and to my knowledge, thats for "green go", meaning the green color of militar uniforms (of the usa) and the want of having them out of latin countrys, its kinda mean? like when someone calls a latinx "Beaner" and stuff
the gringa part had me laughing sm i love you cristine
Pretty sure that's Portuguese because it said Brazil lol.
YouTube should make it so that the subscribe button turns into Holo when we click it.
Video idea maybe?-go to a nail salon to do your nails then try to recreate it.
Come to Brazil!!!!!!!!!!!!  PS: in Brazil gringo = foreigner. It is not offensive at all.
As for anyone saying gringo/gringa isn't an insult, first of all its up to the people you are calling a gringo if they are offended or not by that term. It comes from "green go home" because American soldiers wear green and while they were in foreign countries during wars in the 1900s, it was a term for native people of that country to use as an insult when telling the soldiers to go home.
When she said "binders of affidavits" it reminded me of Mitt Romney's "binder full of women" and I actually chuckled.
Kristin : **takes off ponytail for tea break** Me : look at that beautiful hair 🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️ Btw sorry if I spelled her name wrong 😅
Based on experience, the person who decides to use stolen content is not the person who is being paid to edit/photoshop it. So typically what would go through that person's mind as they sit there blurring the watermark is something like "My boss is unethical but if I refuse to do this I'm gonna lose this job, and I can't afford to do that, so welp". In capitalism, there comes a point where morals are an unaffordable luxury, sadly.
So it was portuguese and not Spanish but you get them girl.  The person from Argentina who watches you: can we be friends?
I have to wonder if that full face of multichrome powder is what triggered Cristine's skin allergy to certain metals...
Simply nailogical I found that there is a nail polish that changes color depending on how hot or cold the nail touches for an example if you dip your finger into cold water the nail will turn purple if you dip the nail into hot water it turns pink
Don’t take this wrong(seriously it’s a good thing) I literally thought this was an “old video” bc you look so young 💀👍🏼😂I mean that’s great though you age GREAT😊♥️Love you
I’m sorry this happens to you. It’s fucked up
"I can't read spanish" well me too but that was Portuguese...
6:15   Portuguese text:  Cristine: I don't know what it's written because I don't speak Spanish   😂😂😂😂😂 I don't want to be mean, it just made me laugh
Lmao a gringa or gringo is just a way that is Hispanic people call white people, especially if they try and speak Spanish and obviously cannot.
"Why am I supporting assholes?"   We should all ask ourselves this question daily.
Hey!! Gringa means that a person it's from outside the country.. in case here in Brazil. Like, you are a gringa bcz you're from Canada.. we use more for people that looks to come from the North part of the earth, like firt word countries...
Rip off of H3
6:we Simply that video was in Spanish of course and I now Spanish so I now what stuff was roten their :D
Latin American here, the word gringa or gringo is generally used to refer to people who either speak English or are from the u.s, and yeah, it can be used as something mean, where I'm from we also use the world yankee for the same purpose. But also there's a lot of different meanings for the same word in Latin America, even within different languages, so beware lmao
The one at 7:32 is advertising a printer that “prints any image from your phone onto your nails in 35 seconds. Exclusively in Algeria” then they say to click on the link to order lol
They really thought that the best person to steal from was a crime statistics analyst?
6:14 ma'am that's Portuguese
Simply you look amazing
I love that one of them she was like well how could you print that so big when they are click baiting you and other people
You know, when I heard you started Halo Taco, I heard it on another nail channel.  The first thing I said was "Hold up! Is this from the lady who started calling top coat taco?"  When Suzie explained you sent her a promo box, I was like ok, ok ok.  I was about to say - you can't be stealing!!! lol.  I've ordered about 10 bottles of halo taco.  I love the quality of your products.  Oh yeah, in Texas Gringo is Spanish slang for white man, so, Gringa means white woman?!?  Maybe?
GET EM SIMPLY 🤣
Watch out brands no one has ever heard of there are 7.7 million investigators and court personal looking for copyright infringement!
6:18 girl that aint spanish, it's brazilian portuguese
Oh girl I was passing by a hood in my country and I saw a big ass print of James Charles thumbnail🤦🏾‍♀️
Dude, now with the data protection law, using your face without asking is illegal!!!!! PUT ALL THEM DOOOOWWWN😠👊😂😂😂 I’m laughing, but I’m serious!
When you google dip powder nails its one of the top image results. Then people just copy and paste and print. Hence why its everywhere.
There is no exact origin we can pinpoint to for the word gringo(male) and gringa(female). But one of the theories is that it comes from the war between Mexico and United States were the United States military had green uniforms and the Mexican soldiers would say “Green Go”. Therefore a lot Latin American countries use that word to refer to white American people.   Anyway, you’re awesome!
SHE SAID ARGENTINAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Welcome to business as usual; either hire an attorney or STFU.
Wot
I think that this is a bigger issue.  The reason your nails are in so many salons is because they are ordering them from an actual supplier.  I would call the actual salons and ask the manager where they got the posters.
They really had a photo of ben LMAOO
I love that they stole footage of Ben’s nails too 😂 These companies really have no shame.
KKKKKKKKKK I'm from Brasil and exhibit B was in my instagram today. The advertisement video is actually in portuguese, not spanish. I'm guessing you showed up because in the end os the video, there's a phrase: "the new success among the gringos", wich is a slang that means foreigners. I can translate it all if you want. Just let me know!
not spanish !!😂
her hair be looking good tho👀
"the latest trend of what technology has achieved for beautifying nails, which is a printer that draws for you any picture you have on your phone on your nails in 35 seconds approximately. available only in Algeria"  that's the translation for the first 3 lines for the Instagram post under the username @entre.nous.official  "tap on the post and you will have the official page for this printer" that's the translation for the 4th bolded line. the language is Arabic XD
"Gringo" is an name Latinos use to refer to American people. It comes from back when American soldiers occupied Latin American land. The soldiers' uniforms were green and people use to yell at them "Green go home". So it evolved until it became "Gringo". So the root of the word is mean, but nowadays people use it to reefer to Americans and sometimes any other English speaking person (because all of that is "the same thing" 🙄).
You should collab with LeagalEagle
👁👄👁 👉📱  me seeing this vid and redownloading all social media to jump these troll companies
Kind of sounds like sailor moon in the background for a sce
SimplyServing them a cease and desist
"Gringas" and "gringos" it refers to the US army that come here in the past (many years ago) in México and other places (i dont know anywhere else), in the past it was a shorter way of saying "Green go" (because the color of their uniforms is green), now we just use it as a way of saying "american people" (from USA). I hope this was helpful <3
*Cristine get prettier, or have I just missed her?*
Although it is Portuguese, it was pretty easy to understand as a spanish speaker XD It said "the new fever (trend) among the white girls!"
you look so much like you sister with your hair down
it's actually Portuguese Christine, loo
hahaha I've just been sippin some tea while you spill the tea...
God loves you
HER HAIR IS DOWN AND STRAIGHT
sue them
the fact that they stole Ben's toe nails for a nail oil ad shows how lazy and desperate they are  lmaoooo
Gives off content court vibes from h3h3
Omg no honey noooo that was NOT spanish JAJAJJAJA I don't know if it was a joke or what but todo bien igual, cero resentimientos
Dude, I haven’t seen her in about 6 months (idk why) but, why does she sound so different!?!
Spanish people quaking from Cristine trying to figure out the word *gringa*
'Let's go'  *TO COURT*
6:00 it's actually portuguese, they are advertising some kind of stick on fake nails you can do at home. Gringa is not a mean term, tho it can be, it's like "white girl", source: I'm brazilian. Btw, f*** that company, instagram does that all the time
I’ll cut your hair Cristine!! <3 (don’t worry I’m a licensed hairstylist)
you should show up at a salon, just to look at nail polish and then dont by any... and say Love the picture!!!  and  walk out,   and then send a n  do not use order  for it... and see if they take it down, if not send the legal notice.
oof
That's Portuguese, not Spanish. Brazilian Portuguese to be exact. Kisses from Portugal ❤🇵🇹
OMG the Arabic one is Algerian , I know this page on Instagram 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
christine, just be a nail model already😭
Hi cristine, I'm a Brazillian fan of yours and the term "gringo" is basically a national term for "foreigner", it's not exactly offensive, don't worry about it! And in Brazil we talk portuguese, not spanish! Love your content <3
Your eyes (and skin) look great, hope you're doing better!
im mexican and grigo means american or white people or a gringa wich mean white
Is NOT spanish. Is portuguese
I thought Canada would teach Geography better than US to the point people would know that in Brazil we actually speak Portuguese. It seems that I was wrong :(
YOUR ALIVE
Listen to this.  If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God's son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16   God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there's only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO's are real... Soon the antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it's too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, he loves you, open your heart take a chance receive Jesus as your savior.

THAT'S NO SPANISH HAHA, THATS PORTUGUESE 6:20
That’s shocking to see your art in nail salons!!
the advertisement that used your face was in Portuguese and is from Brazil, as a Brazilian who has been following you for a long time, I feel ashamed. 😔😔😔 You are AMAZING!
Wow. People are shady.
Guys protect yourself She has a hammer 2020 is still going... A murder tragedy can still happen
Please Cristine don’t be those kind of people that say Portuguese is Spanish... 🤦🏽‍♀️
U should do a vid buying these products and trying them 🤣 ILYSM
6:19 that's not spanish, that's portuguese

Nice hair transformation! !👧
Are you gonna report a few of those companies? Or you just gonna leave it?
Company: sees video Also the company: ITS FREE REAL ESTATE
stop stray tanning 😭
(6:17) that's actually portuguese lmao (but spanish is really similiar, so that's a common mistake), and in behalf of brazil I'd like to apologize for stealing your nails queen 😔  edit: also "a nova febre das gringas" can be roughly  translated to "the new trend in the us" (but in "gringas", in implies feminine) which is really funny because you're canadian, but it has nothing to do with white girls lmao
You’re hair looks so pretty! Happy to see you’re looking healthy too
Not only are they stealing content to make a quick buck,but a lot of these companies are scams on the internet. I want to start a petition were if any of us sees a company using stolen content we start writing "THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM"... Hit em where it hurts...
What would really help is not only for viewers to call them out but report the offending content to the platform and for FB, IG, YT, TT to do something about it.  It's really not that difficult to provide a comment section where the viewer can put a link to the content owner of images to prove claims and to keep people from claiming falsely.
Cristine! I have a nail polish request, i really need a navy blue one please! like the Indigo one but navy blue!! please!!! ps. I just got indigo and the purple to green multi-chrome and i love them!! Little by Little I'm making a holo taco collection.
Anyone else thinking the printouts in nail salons might be being sold by a third party? Or be on a dodgey stock photo sight? It seems strange that the same images got picked up by so many and in such nice quality.
that isn't spanish, I believe that's portuguese. But yes, Gringa or Gringo is what you'd call a white person. more specifically, when they have difficulty speaking spanish or when they are offensive towards spanish cultures and have a superiority complex.
I'm not proud of how long it took me to figure out you were saying "mirror" instead of "mere."
it's literally written "Brasil" and she says "I can't read Spanish" r u fuckinbg kidding me?
Cristiiiine, that is actually brazilian portuguese and here we dont use "gringa" in a pejorative way, is just a name to describe people from other countrys. And yes, it does say "the new hot stuff among international women"
I need to thank you because thanks to your tips my nails finally stay long and I can enjoy them for a while
Minute 6:14 I guess is portuguese because that isn't spanish!
simply my friend was promoting HOLO TOCO!!!!!!!!
ok but your hair looks SO HEALTHY
thats,,,,not spanish
Yeah I was gonna translate the portuguese one but then she said it's spanish when the thing even said Brazil sooooo.... (it's just a buncha random crap you'd see in english anyways, get it now, so cool, free shipping, etc) Also gringo is a not so nice but sometimes nice way to refer to foreigners in Brazil
6:06 gringos are basically foreigners in Brazil
This video is a beautiful way to turn around the issue by making money off of showing a video of all the thieves and letting the reporters and the commentators know they are doing the right thing by reporting the theft in comments and direct messages to you. Now every single person who reported a copyright theft to you or commented on the products now knows that they are awesome for helping. Nice!
I love that it’s not even a gavel. It’s a rubber mallet.
Lmfao gringa 😂
I’m not saying it’s okay but the nail salons more than likely went on to google images, typed in the type of photo they were looking for or the product they wanted to display and simply’s thumbnails came up, they may not be aware
"Paying artists for their work" Thank you for putting this in your courtroom and we all should SAY IT LOUDER
Did you send them cease and desist orders?
If they are going to steal pictures from you to sell socks, they should obviously use the pictures where you were dressed in a giant sock 🤔
Yes, gringo does usually refer to white people, so gringa would be white girls. It's not exactly pejorative, I think, but it is a bit indelicate
I bet the dip powder one was provided by the suppliers, too much of a coincidence it was in so many salons
I personally don’t think Gringo it’s an offensive word, like it can be but depends on the context and in this one it’s like a way to say “Foreigners are doing this trend so you should too”
Something similar happened to a german YouTube duo. They made homemade Döner kebab and a Dönerbistro took the picture of that videos thumbnail and put it on display of their bistro.
I don't get how you can be so nice about it, I am getting SO upset on your behalf that these low life businesses straight up STEAL your property, I would have went on a full blown 'name and shame' crusade if it was my brand.
12:06 at least they weren't hiding that they were ripping off of you your water mark was very visible 😂😂
Me just after watching the latest episode of The Undoing, seeing Cristine with a giant hammer: 😳
Don't worry gringa/ gringo isn't mean it's just what we call someone from the states.
Cristine finding out the meaning of gringa Im dying lol
SIMPLY!!! That’s not Spanish!! It’s even written “Brasil”. You failed geography 😔
not Cristine defending people who steal her NAildentity  10:48
btw gringa is not offensive, it just means a girl from another country ahhaha
ELA LENDO PORTUGUÊS AMOOOOOOO
Shania Twain’s like, “let’s go... to court” 😭😭 I’m dead
WHERE IS YOUR TEA? Bennnn n
" I cant read spanish"... my little portuguese heart just died
That clip with your face on it where u say “oh my god” that add is not on Spanish is in Portuguese
at 6:02 the clip shown is in (brazillian) Portuguese, not Spanish. I'll translate it for you, it says (in order of appearance)  "the new hot product among international girls!" (it is actually a slang, but i consider it offensive, so i just basically adapted what is said) "Now in Brazil"  "Gel polish nails can now be done at home! guaranteed long and resistant nails for up to 20 days"  "Make sure to get your kit with no delivery fee, and as a bonus get an UV lamp!" and at the end, we have the ""the new hot product among international girls!" with Cristine's face.
This makes me wonder how many other ads or things I've seen that are stolen.
I can see why they would use pictures of your nails but that doesn’t mean its ok. I get that they want to sell their products but stealing from content creators isnt right. Also they’re not even showing their own product when they steal pictures. And why would they think its a good idea to show your face? Like do they not realize they could easily be ✨sued✨?
I love you, but I'm over english speakers confusing portuguese with spanish, not sending hate by any means but, that was not spanish in 6:25
Okay, but why do you look like a 21 years old girl in this video? I don't know what it is, but I'm so confused 🤔
i know this is completely irrelevant but.. you should check these out they sound cool but could be a scam...  https://www.amazon.com/DAGEDA-Chrome-Cushion-Powder-one%EF%BC%88/dp/B08CRRB1YD
Never have you been more Canadian than when being unfamiliar with the term gringa/gringo.
I feel like what a lot of these fast fashion places do is google something relevant to their product (googling "dip powder nails" will get you the image of Cristine's video pretty quick, I'm sure) and just use whatever pictures they feel suit their brand. One issue with  social media and especially instagram and Facebook's ad revenue is that it doesn't take a company with a lot of skill or even money to advertise their product. I'm sure half of these companies employ amateurs who are ignorant of IP and trademark law and just use whatever methods are easy and available, especially in countries where the ip law is different from in north america.
You should do nail art with the nail polish that the companies how stole your NAIL PICS!!!
It’s Brazilian Portuguese. It said new trend among American women.
You should get knuckle tattoos of your name/brand so that they can't steal anymore.
that moment when you realize that "gringo" is the name of a dish...
Who knew Intellectual Property theft could be so entertaining?
THEORY: with all the in-person salons taking that one same picture I'm guessing they are actually doing the right thing most salons do and using stock photos they've paid for. I think a stock photo company stole it, not the individual salons.
I wonder if the problem is with these websites that offer free clip art that you can download.  There are a lot of websites that are offering "public domain" images.  As far as I know a YouTube thumbnail photos do not fall under copyright or trademark due to the fact that the thumbnail is a snapshot of one second of video which I believe falls under the "fair use" rule.  That's why music teachers are able to use written music in bits and pieces in their copied notes for students.....which means the stealing is coming into the problem is because they are not pointing out that they are not blatantly informing the public who's images they are using.....which is even worse.  The fact that the one company left your watermark on the video means they purposely left it there.....the ones that blurred it......yeah......no.......really bad practice.........but "fair use" also means they had to at least inform you they wanted to use it....disgusting how some people and/or companies abuse the "fair use" rules.  Question: Is YouTube paying fees to trademark/copyright your materials for you?!  Are you paying for trademark/copyright for your content?  If not, unfortunately it's fair game for these companies to do what their doing if the content isn't trademarked/copyrighted.  There are many cases being thrown out by crafters because they are saying others are stealing their work to sell it, but did not take the steps to trademark their item so therefore it is open to bring copied and sold by who ever wants to........trademarks/copyrights is a very slippery slope (and confusing) when it comes to proving the "fair use" rule as well as other parts of it.
Gringa means white girl
Not the gringas 😭
So this is what  Rationality Rules watches in his spare time, huh.
I'm so sad you told that we speak spanish in Brazil 😅 it's portuguese! Lol
You know it's serious when Christine makes a video with her hair down
Gringa is white girl.  It can be derogatory, depending on how it's used.
Face next to face sn is tan!
Can u watermark over the nail designs instead of under them so the content is not usable to thieving companies
That's not Spanish, that's Portuguese! It says something along the lines of "new international fad now available in Brazil"  "Gel nails you can do at home and guarantees long, resistant nails for up to 20 days" "Get your kit with free shipping now and get a uv light for free"
You should go to nail saloon that steal to content
I bet the thumbnails are from google image searches
That's portuguese, they're calling you "from the states", or english speaking foreigner (gringa) and the ad is for home polygel . We don't call them "american". Yes, also a food dish. No, I don't speak portuguese, but reading it isn't hard if you speak spanish
I feel like with the salons using the pictures of your nails it’s because when you look up like “dip powder nails” your thumbnail actually comes up as a imagine on google but once you click it it opens your video, they probably just printed it off of google not even knowing
If it counts for anything, you are my favorite gringa💕
that's not Spanish it's Brazilian Portuguese 😭
I am so sorry that these companies are doing this. It must be frustrating and near enraging to you, that they are trying to earn a buck off your hard work.
Cristine, I love your videos and I fully support you.  But you just hurt me so much, because THATS NOT SPANISH, ITS PORTUGUESE!
It's Portuguese not Español 🤣
11:44 reminded me immediately of Chef John 😂
6:19 it´s portuguese not spanish
Gringa/o is kind of like saying "white girl/boy" mixed with "whitey" and "anglo". I know that we often describe Taco Bell style tacos as "Tacos gringos" or "tacos gueros". "Guero" is another term to describe "white" people. I think if it was derogatory, Gringa/o is probably worse than Guero but they both kind of mean the same thing. The former is more used towards European-like people whereas the latter is more commonly used towards latino people whose skin is fairer than other latinos.
❤️❤️❤️
I owned a nail salon for a bit and other salons and tech stealing pictures is sooo rampant. I made sure each of our techs only displayed their work with object that is held and a watermark. Even when we sold our salon the next people stole photos from tech who didn’t work for them and keep coming to me to tell them to stop.
just sue them?
The whole stealing images thing gets me so heated. I see so many companies on Facebook ads that are using stolen crafter's images to sell garbage knock offs.  I know it's only a matter of time before it happens to me.   But as stated. The best thing we can do is comment on those posts called them out!
can someone plz get cristine a real gavel
Gringa is people from other countries that aren’t Brasil
It’s Portuguese
Yes that is what it said for the Spanish part!
petition to make the subscribe button turn holo when you subscribe to simply
You should make a video calling their customer service 🤣
okay 1) pop off 2) love the fit 3) we know you’re not going to cut your hair and 4) I love how you’ll sue over ben’s nails
Gringo or gringa is basically a person from north america who speaks english. So like Canadians but it is mostly used for people from the US.
I was surprised of your knowledge of legal terms, then remembered what you do for a living (business & crime statistics analyst) and it made way more sense ! Would've made a great lawyer if you wanted to ! Loved the video
What I noticed today: -The following leader of the holosexual club, must not have had time to holo her galat, so she put the logo on both sides               -simply put her hair down and is absolutely beautiful  -I love her Chanel even more (love you simply)
I’m wearing holo taco right now I love duo Crome !!!!!! 💅💅
I have to be honest I saw the ig add another multi chromes but I thought it was a dude im sorry 😂😂😂
What if roots did this
So lemme get this straight  The person presenting the case is the same person as the judge 🧐 Isn’t that a bit biased? 🤣🤣 I don’t know why, but I love this type of video You should make more of these types of videos!
shes Canadian Everythings free there
OMG I USED TO WATCH YOU 4/5 YEARS AGO I REMEMBER YOUR RAIN DROP NAILS AND YOU LIKE HOW TO GROW YOUR NAILS AND SO MUCH MORE OMG ITS BEEN SO LONG HI!
Lol that's not spanish and it actually said it on the translate 🤣 it's portuguese
You should visit one of these shops and tell them you want what's in the picture and while getting it done ask them where they got the picture from, if they took it themselves.
What on earth are you rambling on about. Get yourself a lawyer? Who cares..
Hey Christine! I'm so sorry this happened to you. Thank you for spreading the word. Stay awesomely halo🦄
у тебя такие красивые волосы!! LOVE IT
6:21 ITS NOT SPANISH ITS PORTUGUESE IM FROM BRAZIL AND WE SPEAK PORTUGUESE UHGH but I still love u
The portuguese  😂😂 omg
You post these ideas to a corporate owned website, and then expect the company conglomerates to not take a good idea? Youtube is used by corporations like a "Steal my idea Showcase". And no, youtube doesnt care. They Enable INTENTIONALLY.
this is so lame chic//these people are sharing your work and your nail polishes so the more the merry ..meaning more money in your pockets  !! I dont ever want to buy your products ..by the way dam ass face book has  in shared at the bottom,,so your fault !!..i would be happy to take your fucken ass off!! lets talk real..
Y everybody messen with simplies 💅 nails
They should have just asked or make a replica of your video with there own nails 💅 🤔
I wondered how long before crappy dupes copied your products. :( I hate that for you love!
that ' s not spanish haha it's portuguese. kisses from brasil btw
Can u do a collab with nerdecrafter
Cristine went to French immersion school in Canada where French shares the official language title with English...as an American I am STILL bothered we don’t offer Spanish immersion or allow Spanish to become the OFFICIAL second language 🤦🏻‍♀️ If your shampoo, vacuum and watercolor set all sold here include Spanish then you ought to recognize it as an official thing and allow education that improves the communication and quality of life for all of us. I speak French because I’m second gen québécois but I also speak Spanish because I’ve got friends and family from Mexico. I guess Cristine not knowing “gringa” made me have a moment of omg, that’s right, Canada isn’t adjacent to Mexico and they don’t all just know simple Spanish there the way we do here. It’s a duh moment but one that really makes me even more sure that the US needs to just allow Spanish up be official so patients in the hospital who strictly speak it aren’t denied decent care because we can’t get a translator. I am sorry, you just never know where a rant is going to come from!!
HOW DARE THEY!!!!!!!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
where's the watermark on this video?
not being bitchy, but the video with polygel is not in Spanish, it's in Brazilian Portuguese (which you found out),  they are saying that people can now find polygel products in Brazil and it is a sensation among foreign people. it is common in Brazilian marketing, that companies use this term to attract buyers and that various companies use unauthorized content (as Brazilian and marketing obsessed, I don't agree).
Are we not going to talk about the printed thumbnail in the salons that says “Dip Nails?” With a question mark!? 😂
Repeat this prayer from your mouth, and believe it in your heart.  Dear Heavenly Father, i turn to you today, I repent of my sins; I believe that your Son Jesus Christ, died on the cross for my sins, and was resurrected to life on the third day, and forever more he lives. Father, I ask of you to baptize me with the Holy Spirit right now, Change my heart, and renew my spirit. I invite you Jesus, to enter into my heart. change me, Save me, and be Lord of my life. Right now, in your mighty name, I pray, Amen!  Romans 10:9  If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
Sometimes gringo can be an insult, but in this case is more like foreigner. It's brazilian portuguese, it says "the new fever ~trend~ among foreigners, it's now in Brazil"
The biggest shock of 2020 would be simply chopping her hair short! Omg i can't imagine that!🔪🥺
the way Ben is clearly wondering if Cristine has come up with some weird science that involves hammering stuff flat/to powder...
Sooo... the consequences are? Grrrr.
I think that’s portugués
its not spanish. its pportuguese. pls come on
Is there a market for making signs for nail salons? If so get in on it.
Biblical implications about vaccine and Christian doctors have confirmed. See Revelation 18 and do research. Pray for wisdom and He will give it freely. Contains man made enzyme called LUCIFERASE. God's people die from lack of knowledge.
Yesterday. I went into my sisters room and clipped her nails off cause she always scratches me. I hate long nails.
6:16 that wasn’t Spanish..., that’s Portuguese
Time to send out cease and desist letters.
Anyone else think she looks radiant today??
Ur hair looks sooóoo good cristine also can u please do another makeup vid by following another loln nikkietutoruals Please !!!!  BTW I'm have been subscribed for years and love all your videos
She looks amazinggg like her hair, her skin...she's THRIVING during quarantine (it's still quarantine in the us right..?) I MEAN ALL I GOT WAS DEPRESSION-
Omg the first salon is a salon in Florida.... small world
LMAO!  When you said I can't read Spanish I tried to read it but then I'm like wait why can't I read that?! I can read Spanish.. well we're wrong.   it's Portuguese lmao.
who else wants her to buy thier products to show that they are crap? i know she doesn't want to support them but im curious
I wonder if there is a company that is selling print outs of your thumbnails to salons, because it seems so odd that the same one would show up so many times. 🤔🤔🤔 In that case the salons themselves would not be at fault.
Its nail art lady. You cant sit on everything you make and put a fence around it when it comes to art. You copy others work they..........oh shit they did litterally steal your work. Oh well i dont belive in the pattent system at all. Good luck my daughters love your program btw.
The one that used your face it's in portuguese and it means: The new fever among foreign (people of other contries)
GRINGA MEANS FOREIGN IN BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE XD
Am I the only one who thinks she look like Louisa from Jane The Virgin?
My gf watches you all the time and since you seem to know alot about youtubers rules.  Don't you do the same thing to others like troom troom for example by posting their videos and recreating them and so giving youself content? I mean most youtubers steal content for their own even if its fair use they will steal music, pictures, videos, other youtubers etc etc.
Omfg u need to go to one of these salons xksjdownxjajfiejzhiah
“Binders of affidavits” 😂😂
IT'S PORTUGUESE, NOT SPANISH! WE LOVE YOU HERE IN BRAZIL ♥️
christine trying to understand "gringas" had me dying   (it's Brazilian slang, btw, meaning any people from foreign countries)
The nail polish wall is so aesthetically pleasing 😭😍😍
As a Brazilian fan, I never thought I’d see Cristine speaking portuguese and now I can say you sounded so cute hahahahah and pretty accurate!
To everyome: gringo is a way latin americans call the people from the U.S. it's shorter than say "estadounidense" and no, many of us refuse to call them "americans" because we share a continent.
6:17  ...Cristine... girl ... holo mom ...that´s not even spanish hahahah
if you publish video or picture on internet, it's not your's anymore.
That isn't spanish but I think Italian?
I recognised these nails immediately!!!    ------>     https://www.mexten.com/product/mirror-nail-polish/    Shame on them!
6:55 calLING US OUT LMAO Yes in Costa Rica you're either one of $ things: Gringo (which is white) Nica (any other Spanish speaking county) or Tico which is a local lolol
“Gringo” is how we call a foreign person here in Brazil, doesn’t mean bad things, it’s just the way we talk. And the ad wasn’t in spanish, it was in portuguese. Come to Brazil 🥺🥺
AMV  https://youtu.be/re2brz8wA4s
That’s Internet at Best.  Once it’s out there, people will continue to screenshot and use.
If multiple nail salons have the dip powder poster isn’t it more *logical* that a nail salon sales company is selling it to all the salons?? The companies who sell the books of nails, racks, pedi chairs, etc to the nail salons are probably the real culprit also selling this poster.
Omg is portuguese no spanish
Sad part is that I'm brazilian and  "a nova febre das gringas" (that is actually portuguese lol) was an add that i saw in my Instagram so many times... And i was like.. Whyyy???
Re: Salons printing out thumbnails... coming from a graphics person, I totally get how this happens. Yeah, some might be deliberately ripping it off, but unfortunately, due to either/both lack of education or willful ignorance, there are many people in business that think it is completely acceptable to utilize Google image search as a free-for-all stock image catalog. They search "dip powder nails," find that thumbnail in one scroll, see the shiny image and the text, and in their minds, the ad is done! It goes to a designer or printer who doesn't know or care that it's not their content, gets a resolution boost, and gets printed. It's sad, but terribly common. I've had to explain too many times, "No, it's not free just because you got it from Google."
YAAAAAAAAAAAASSS GIRL!!! DRAG THEM THRU THE MUD!!!!!
Hejjj do a best red nail polish
Is no one gonna talk about how pretty she looks in those straight hair✨👀

Cristin: I don’t know Spanish  Me: melting my brain because it was  not in Spanish it was in Portuguese
havent watched you for 2 ears and i come back and wow u look amazingggggg
Gringo is just how we call anyone that isn't Latinx. In Brazil (wich is where the ad is from, it's in portuguese) we do sometimes use it as a bad thing, but mostly is just like "oh, they aren't from around here". The ad was just saying they were selling a nail kit, salons do that a lot over here.
Ahahhahahahahhahaa omg this had to be made. Queen I will buy you're polish sets soon I almost did, lost my wallet and had to cancel my cards. Hopefully things get better soon thanks for another amazing video! This christmas will be holo
It's so frustrating when companies do something that is obviously not ok but you have no legal leverage whatsoever. Especially if they are in a different country.  The booking company Opodo still hasn't given me my money after over a year, from when my flight was cancelled. It was stated I can switch to a different time or get my money back and I wanted the money but they have actually no way of contacting them (all no-reply emails where they tell me to reply and shit like that). Because the are in the UK I brought it to European Consumerism but even then nothing changed.  I hate those big companies who just don't give a fuck and you literally can do nothing, even though it is obviously illegal what they are doing.
Português amiga, não espanhol. 👍
Who's next
1 John 2:15-17 (KJV)  Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.
Acts 2:38 (KJV)  Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Acts 5:32 (KJV)  And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him. Hebrews 5:9 (KJV)  And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him; Proverbs 28:13 (KJV)  He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy, Hebrews 12:14 (KJV)  Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord'
"A nova febre entre as gringas" 🤪 Cristine searching what that means killed me. AND IT'S PORTUGUESE not Spanish.
-11:23 i dont think its spanish.. maybe Portuguese
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I ordered the holiday collection and some more and a few days later they made a black friday promo and had no shipping fees. I am crying a little bit, but anyway, now is a good time to order overseas!
kinda hate these kind of videos since they make me so upset and sad and angry, but it's simply so imma watch anyway!
Any other Brazilian follower devastated because Cristine didn't know that add was in Portuguese?
nooooooooo- !!!!! damn all those companies, i hope they go bankrupt and the people responsible are given great misfortune for stealing good-girl simply's nails >:c!!
Good for you for calling them out on their BS!  Btw love your earrings and was wondering what brand they are?
I would have love bens reaction to nail companies stealing his nails as well... and his face trying to sell him 😮
The company’s watching this be like:  Coworker:hey uhh boss so umm something happened..  Boss:what, did we get more money or something?   Coworker:yea no we are getting cancelled...   Boss:...
Gringa basically means white girl
Gringo (for men) gringa (for women) are actually a borderline derogatory Spanish term for white person but it holds a negative tone. The fever of gringos is the fever of white ppl.
That is not English, it’s Portuguese ahahah. Gringa is not mean.

6:16 Cristine: I have no idea what's going on, I don't speak Spanish Portuguese: am I a joke to you?  Jk love you Cristine ❤️ (but yea not Spanish)
THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized. Visit NeedGod.com and LivingWaters.com

I am so confused by this poster "dip powder nails?" For the thumbnail, make sense. For a service you offer at a salon, WHY THE F'CK IS THERE A QUESTION MARK!!!?   Like if I just walked in and saw that I would be so f'cking confused
7:31 it says "The latest technology for manicure, a printer that draws any picture you have on the phone on your nails within 35 seconds, exclusively and only in Algeria" i was ok with it until i read the last sentence ...
SHE SAID "I DONT READ SPANISH"💀💀💀💀 (Its Portuguese, and gringa/o means white people)🤣
*Portuguese
Heyy i just wanna add that they might wanna fight back  so be prepared i might happen though
HOPE ❤️, Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people Hope in absolute perfection !!! No more dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the Hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17 📖nkjv
That was not Spanish, it looks like Portuguese.
It’s crazy how I and many other people have been watching her since the very very start!!🥺❤️😭and I remember for my brothers birthday I tried recreating the Pokémon nails she did years ago!when she would do tutorials and when we didn’t know how she even looked!!💕💕
"Spanish" and yet gringos don't know what portuguese is
gringa/o basically means white girl/man. but its slang and can be used for any english speaker who doesnt speak spanish. usually its used for white people though.
Thank god you didn’t but the products!!! So glad you didn’t. I’m so sorry you’re being ripped off! ALSO: you CAN report the ads and say that you are in them. I had to do it with a real estate calling company I had started, I started it in 2016/17 & already gave up lol. But I reported it and uploaded the original with proof and it got taken down. So reporting can work! Especially when my stolen product was a pdf of a real estate calling script, and yours is actual photos of you and Ben! So I think you would have a good chance of getting it taken down! I think I just got lucky the one and only time I did it lol.
Gringo/as is in fact very mean 😅 It’s not exactly derogatory I would say but it’s definitely meant to be demeaning towards light skin people, even if they themselves are latinx or Spanish speakers 😕 Also that writing wasn’t Spanish but it’s still a Latin language so I was kinda able to understand it lol
Did you trade mark your looks and copy right your image? Before anyone makes counter arguments you have people on the Dark webb sell images on websites like pink meth. It has taken pictures of women in their private moment and has sold them. Many of the victims had to get a copyright or trade mark to take down the photos.
I laughed so hard at "ben or the nail oil" 🤣
It wasn’t spanish, it was portugueseee!!!!! From Brasil, we don’t speak spanish. Buttttt, shame on the company that stole your face. Gringa means anyone from another country , we just call then “gringos” it isn’t mean! Gringa (female), gringo (male), gringos (plural)
I want to see you among us for a video pls💕
The Gringa video it’s not in Spanish. I believe it’s in Portuguese. Gringo(a) it’s not an offensive term. It’s another word for Americans. It’s commonly use by Latinos.
https://youtu.be/dpGE4wRjhrw
Do a video where you try the fake companies
Can you please review born pretty thermal nail polish please.
Someone, please get her a mallet so she doesn't break anything lmaooo
Well, this is great that you’ve let us all know. Keep it up hun, we all know exactly where these pictures are from so we’ll call them out for you ❤️🇦🇺
FWIW, in my salon I only carry Caption (Young Nails) and Holo Taco polishes to use on clients who want regular polish on fingers and/or toes and I still wouldn’t steal a thumbnail to post in my window. Those people are insane!! I swear it takes more brain power and money to steal than it does not to.
how tf you don’t know what gringa means lol
Hi Cristine, i am from Brazil. When you read "a nova febre entre as gringas" this mean "the New hot trend among girls of europe and North America"
Please do a nail art
You should show Ben his picture on that advertisement you just gave as an example and see what he says about this whole thing...The company’s way of profit is wrong and simply stupid. 🤨
Your next video should be buying products from small companies using your photos and see if they work the same
Garbage video smh
🎥https://youtu.be/41baMYcCR0w
Hi Cristine! So glad to see the skin around your eyes is doing much better! I hope this continues and you can wave that unpleasantness farewell to that with 2020! 💜
I see the pinterest ads all the time for the chrome polish and I report it every time 😂
UR ON TRENDING AGAINN
Wait when did Cristine stop watermarking her videos
omg Christine!!!! get some new EARPHONES those are like 10 years old
Cristine: wait.... the subscribe button doesn't turn green it turns grey. Ew why? *moves on*  Me: *world turned upside down* WHY DOESNT IT TURN GREEN????? 😂😂😂😂😂
you should do a video of you going to a salon and filming your reaction
You know what I realized half way through, I have the same color hoodie and I live in Ottawa too 😂
This is crazy! Sierra Schultzie made a similar video recently. The ones in the nail salons are maybe slightly better? Since they’re just using it to draw in customers and then they will provide a real service, whereas the online ones are just scamming and maybe won’t even send a real product/will send something dangerous.
Spanish? It says now in Brazil! Ha ha
Im sorry you got called gringa 😅 yeah its like whitegirl.
idk what it is but simply looks different here.... i like it
If I was you those nail salon with your pictures of your nails I will put their name out there so my followers can go attack them and I love watching your videos😁
File LAWSUIT
You should go to a nail salon and have them do the craziest design they can do on one hand then go back home and try to do the same thing on the other hand yourself
I know your face allergy drama has been going on so no makeup, but your skin has never looked better!!
that isn't spanish, that's portuguese 😂 it means it's trendy in foreign countries
The text that says "a nove frebre entre as gringas, o alogamiento em polygel puede ser feito em casa, e promete unhas grandes e resistentes ate 20 dias" it's portuguese, "gringas" it's a despective nickname that people use referring to american, australian, canadian and british people, it's a composed work of "green" (because the US army used green regimentals back in the 1910's, when US tried to enter into Mexico between the mexican revolution) and "go". meantime, it's a classic meal on the north of the country,  technically a quesadilla with roast meat and salsa. As a translation, says "the new feber between the gringas, the polygel treatment can be done in home, promise long and strong nails during 20 days". I'm mexican, but spanish, potuguese, romanian and italian it's pretty similar lol
I think people using YouTube thumbnail is legit , what I mean by that is the nail salon would have given an advertising company "can you make a poster " and the graphic designer would have type in Google image "preety nails ", "nails with polish" or something like that and Google does show youtube thumbnail in results .so there is a good chance that those salons don't even know it's your content
That wasnt even SPANISH it was PORTUGUES.
You're trending!
You should give us a update on your face you look really well!!!
Her teacup matched her hoodieeeee
When she said put a watermark so they know to BACK THE F*CK UP I was laughing so hard 😂😂😂😂
wow, It’s hard out here for a content creator.
My sister is an esthectian and watermarks everything because of this. The beauty industry is a harsh mistress.
When she said “Business Ethics” who else had a flash back to the end of Billy Madison?
The ad with the word gringa was in Portuguese, as it is from Brazil, and no we don’t mean it in a bad way when we call someone gringo, gringa, we just mean that they are not from our country. And you got right, it means “the new hottest trend among gringas”
Gringa(o) is a slang term for “white person.” I’m Mexican and we use it often, I don’t know about other Hispanic/Latino communities, but I know us Mexicans use it lol.
"Because i can't read spanish" girl that's not spanish 😭
Top stories:  Nobody gives a fuck.
Can we get a holo toco mallet for sale????
miss girl that definitely isn’t Spanish lol that’s Portuguese. but gringa i guess is the the same in both languages . BUT LOL when they had that* in the title im sorry i couldn’t stop laughing😭😭
Also, not only did they “photoshop it out and put the other company on top” they didn’t even attempt to do it well. I mean, it was solid black. They could’ve covered it up SO EASILY! And used a decent font to make it look better. Lol
12:26 not only was that your art used but also other youtubers like Cutepolish and I think robin moses? all in that same photo
Finally back to the content that I subbed to kinda sort of
All I need to say is: it’s ✨CRISTINE✨ avec no H
Cool
Girl nooo no no just no  As a spanish speaker that isn't spanish that's Portuguese and they call you gringa in my contry that only applies to people form the US but who knows in Portugal
Omg I love you ha
simply did you know some mothers feed there NEW BORN BABYS with TEA so some of us have been drinking tea sense the age of one month CASE IN POINT TEA IS SO GOOD BABYS DRINK IT BABYS
Shyeonn
Look, all I’m saying is that the multi chrome video is why I started watching you 🤷🏼‍♀️
It's not in Spanish, it's in portuguese. They say "agora no Brasil" (now in Brazil)
Cristine, we need you to sell a Holo Taco sticker already! Trying to salvage it from the box is too hard!
Gringa, means white girl. Gringo, means white guy 😭😭😭
Wow dang
you could put out a weekly video crapping on these companies for using your content and telling people about the real product and they COULD NOT stop you.
0:37 we just gonna pretend like that wasn't damn near black face orrrr
They just google “dip powder nails” and it shows up on google. They just take it because they think it’s a free photo 😅😬
Hi hello I just got an ad for accident lawyers..😳😳⚖ so thx girll
10:30 In Brazil (from where the ad is from) "Gringa" just refers to someone from outside the country, not in a bad way. Basically another word for foreigner in portuguese.
I cannot believe you didn't go with Simply Nail-Law-gical omg
I may be wrong but gringa in portuguese just means foreigner right? And it's not demeaning
I was so confused why Cristine looked so different I was like what is off and HER HAIR IS DOWN
Christine finding out what gringa is was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen 😂😭
Gringa mean white girl
Had the same problem but it was with my butt whole
It's not spanish. It's portuguese.... Brazilian portuguese.... And gringo means people that aren't from Brazil 😘
I saw an add telling people to buy there polish remover not your one and used the video when u tested the one that smelt like car paint remover and cropped it really did look like u was using car stripper as polish remover lol
Mom that’s not spanish  🐸
What I’m curious about is why they all left the ? in the Dip Powder Nails photo 🤣 they probably couldn’t cover it
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i
It's a shame u csnt water mark everything becase they will just scream shot videos and crop it
get there account shout down...! get google to b lock them.
Is true in Costa Rica we do use gringa or gringo but in a nice way. For example if someone is speaking in English and we don't know from which country they are we use it.. Hahaha love the Urban Dictionary use us as an example 💖💖😍😍
Gringo or Gringa = white American 🇺🇸
Oh that arabic one you had no idea about actually said " click on the pic you'll go to an account that sells nail printers , and since you made a video of that so they used your pics "   🤦🏻‍♀️ it's so inappropriate to use someone else's work for your ad or anything without their permission
https://youtu.be/1JeET7KtGhI.
I think there's a printing company that stole your thumbnails and is selling them to businesses to use. Would explain why there's so many using the same thumbnails
i literally tweeted the one from lafayette, louisiana last year thinking you'd NEVER notice it, i just thought it was hilarious that they actually printed your thumbnail like that. but ayeeeeeeee dreams do come true!!!❤️
Ticos are from Costa Rica, gringos are People from USA, of Canadian
Hi! I am from Costa Rica (Central America), just wanted to let you know that "gringas" is not a despective word. When we say gringo or gringa we are refering to people who usually speak english, so people from US or Canada. Another example, here in Costa Rica we refer to ourselves as "ticos", so its kind of the same. Love you, you are awesome, I really enjoy your podcasts and videos.
I feel so bad for critstine.  I hope that they get the right punishment for the wrong deeds they've done.
Why she got iPhone 4 headphones???
As a mechanic.... I want to know where she got that cool white rubber mallet/ shiny gavel
You look so good 😊 with no makeup 💄
Dont be shy, steal the celebrity Kristin too. Oop- to late your face so pretty they already stole it
I love how she says I can’t read Spanish but it’s Portuguese 😂
Nooo 6:20 its not spanish xD. Gringa is the name brasilians usually use for american/foreign girls
That’s right overseas can do whatever they want!! They steal from us and then send it back into our faces to buy!! Good luck with lawsuits this could be a drain on you or something little to nothing won!
A nova febre entre as gringas is in Portuguese not Spanish :D. I think it might want to say "the new fever among Americans". Gringo/gringa in Latin America is often used as a slang word that refers to a foreign person in Latin America which usually are American people. If you are American then you are a gringa for Latin Americans lol
FYI that was not Spanish. I speak Spanish. I'm not sure what it is but I'm guessing maybe  Portuguese Tagalog or Italian
Your nail polish wall looks SO much better!!
you should by nail stuff from ali express to try out
people are poopy <3
Why and how did Ben allow you to have a mallet?
First of all, you look absolutely stunning with your hair down like this.  Now... that post with "gringa" wasn't spanish, it was portuguese, it literally said "Brasil" there ahhahahha but anyway... "Gringo/a" is someone who's not from latin america, anyone. People from Canada, US, UK, Africa, India, China, Japan....... and sometimes yeah it is used a lot in a bad way but not always.
I PROMISE you. If they steal foot pix of you it wont be socks theyre selling
hi, ok so the word "gringo/gringa" at least where I come from means anyone form the states, and it's not a slur or anything used to insult anyone normally. The story behind it (at least in my country) is when the US invaded, they wore green military uniforms. Since not many people knew how to speak english, and they wanted the military men to leave, they would yell "green go", as to telling them to leave. The name stuck so now we say gringo.
You paint your yellow nails with over priced garbage. LMFAO you stold nail painting.
Alguien que hable Spanish
You should do a $5 vs, $20 vs $100 nail art
The most settle, indirect, well worded, passive aggressive light happy anger.  Well done👏👏👏👏👏
Gringo(a) usually equates to “White” lol
I got an add for tea on this video XD
Cristine your hair looks especially pretty!!♥️
you worked hard to make those photos and videos and for people to steal it and pass it off as their own is bullshit
The second video wasn't Spanish it was Portuguese!!! 🤦🏻‍♀️
I wanted to see Ben's reaction to his nails and face being used!
Gringa its not mean ahahha, just a Nickname for those who are foreigners.
For next nail video you should recreate nail art from nail games and/or do nail tutorial from nail games
My wife watches my phone every now and then an I saw this had to watch🤣 but GOTEM!!!🙅🏽‍♂️🤣

6:17 ummm that's Portuguese 😬😅
Thats not spanish!
the one trying to sell the nail oil pens that you came up with with your photos, even having Ben's face in the background..... wild
Outside of Holo Taco (I cannot drop 15$ on a bottle of nail polish) what other brands do you recommend?
So... will those holotaco stickers on that hammer be available? 🤔
Christine, its not holo, its chistholo
The Exhibit B is actually portuguese
Does anybody else like every video just so you can tell if you have watched it or not? No? Just me, ok lmfao have a super awesome day or night everyone 🤪😝🙃🥴😛🤫😆😁😊😶
That wasn’t Spanish 🤣
Only you should be able to reap the massive rewards from the youtube make-up industry (scam). You are a special snowflake.
Take down order?
Most of these companies are just drop shippers
Gringa is not mean, in Costa Rica we say gringos referring to people from United states
Her skin tone looks weird in that video prob the lighting
I remember when a company was stealing art and quotes from tumblr, so everyone started commenting "I would buy a shirt with this on it" on a picture saying "this company steals art, don't buy from them" and the company ACTUALLY had a shirt with that on their site!
ben: are you hammering something down here? you: just companies who stealing my s**t P.S. please  cuss less
6:16 that is not Spanish 🤔, I think is portuguese
The new hot shit with white girls yes lmfao
How can anybody thumbs down this??
We’re all here at the same time
"Buy now!" "Ben or the nailpolish?!"  Honestly we all want to buy a tea slave at some point
I left yt for a month and everyone got hot??
That's Portuguese ignorant 🤣
4:56 best part of the video
Your hair looks so good.
Lol 🥴😂wtf did u guys see the parodies of her on youtube?
Tranquilos que llequeeee
Simply, your hair looks sooo nice! 😍
They would 100% STEAL YOUR HAIR!
Video idea 💡 how about you do a review on nail art kid kits
Hahahaha gringa, so disrespectful... but what can we expect from someone that steals your image?! Hahaha
That’s not Spanish, it’s Portuguese. And gringo/gringa can be used in a derogatory manner, but in this case it’s just trying to say “the new hot trend from abroad now on Brazil” in a “modern”, marketing language. Still, nasty that they stole your content. Cheers!
The ad in portuguese was selling acrylic nails, saying it was the new trend or obsession among "gringos", that was now available in Brasil. Gringo is not necessarily mean, it's just what we call y'all, often used to talk about tourists. It can be used to make fun of someone who's obviously acting like an outsider, jokingly or not, but I see it used most often to just refer to "not Brazilians" (or not lainxs) in general
U need to go to how to cook that’s Chanel she has holo chocolate 🍫
OMG I NEED YOUR MUGGG
Wait are there holo taco stickers?😁
Glad you aren't supporting them!
Omg lol the one that they stole the thumb nail is.....in my language...if anyone wants me to translate it then reply and tell me....😁
When I read the title I thought the companies stole your peelies and I was like :0
Been with this channel 5 years holy shit. Also imagine using someone's content
Its not spanish, is portuguese 😭😭
Is this not a promo for these dupe brands
6:19 it’s portuguese 🗣🗣🗣
The Arabic one at 7:28 says "the latest technology for nails, and it prints any picture from your phone on you your nails in 35 seconds... click on the link to go to the official page to get this nail printer"
https://youtu.be/3bMn_B-a4Uo
Cant read Spanish, TRIGGERED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IS PORTUGUESE!!!
I think that it should be called SimplyLawLogical but just my opinion
6:25 thats portuguese
It's the Chinese way. They dont give a fuck about stealing IP or something because they dont even view it as wrong.
I just saw an ad for Holo Taco on another YT video of a different creator. It was so cool to see your nail company as an ad!
Oh my
Watching your video's for half a year now. I think I'm ready to paint my nails for the first time

Cristine is ✨g l o w I n g✨               seriously though, she looks really pretty and her hair looks gorgeous straight!
Gringa and gringo is slang for white person but not in a good way 6:50

New for 2021  Holo mallet  Bash 2020 away!
A lot of people already said that in Latin America “gringo/gringa” can be a mean way to refer to white English speakers, but not always. “Gringo/gringa” really is just a person that is from USA or from a English speaking country. Is not always an insult, it was born from “green go home”.
I would love to have lunch with me one which one you want to send
Cristine seems angry, yet very calm. I few like before she was very eccentric, but is now somewhat older. It seems like she has achieved more peace. We love to see it
I can see those nail salons be like "oh you want that design from the picture? Lemme just watch simply tutorial real quick"
Cry
Its portuguese Cristine 🤣 it says Brazil. Im from Latinamerica (Chile) and Gringa or gringo means pretty much 'from north america'. Is not mean btw. Is just a very informal word.

It seems like shady/greedy people and "companies" will steal anything they can find to make a quick buck... I even saw a somewhat unusual example the other day: I am a huge fan of Queen and I participate in the fan community. A few years ago, one user had taken footage from an unreleased Queen concert and put it a lot of hard work to restore the video/audio and clean it up and make it look great. He did a beautiful job! But the other day, some random shady "company" put out a teaser video for a restoration that they claimed that they did, but they had clearly STOLEN that other guy's restoration and were just trying to re-sell it as "their own"! (and they destroyed the video/audio too and made it terrible) Even something as unusual as that, there are still people trying to steal it!
New for 2021: HOLO MALLET!  Whack all those holo haters over the head with a new holographic mallet oooh
This video was just so FUNNY😆😆 in a good way😊
Can you and Hiram do a video where he does your hair
i want more simply court PLEASE
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3   PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏
Judge Christine striking down JUSTICE
If you can't take them to court or bring them the law, well, i would definitely make the name of their company known for all to see

It's not in spanish...  It's is portuguese Brazilian...  It's not actully a bad word, it's just a way to say that you aren't from Brazil ...
I'm not fluent in Spanish but I live in Tx and know enough to say that gringa is basically just calling you a white girl
CRISTINE!!!!!!!! I’M OFFENDED!!!!  You’re a cultured woman!!! It is NOT Spanish, it’s PORTUGUESE (from Brazil, but still)!! Damn, man, that one hurt😢  Still love you, HOLLOQUEEN 💿💿💿💿💿
Someone stole my username that I've had since 2009 all over the internet and put it in a book. I still have to get around to filing a DMCA complaint, since this shit has been a brand for a _while_ now. EDIT: @9:44 Wow, they aren't even photoshopping the watermark out _well._ The background is basically black, they could have done a _lot_ better on that one.
"I can't read Spanish" well... that was Portuguese
Its the company that stole your video to showcase bens nails 💅 for me 🤣🤣
lmaooo. it's not spanish, it's portuguese. but yes! both share the word gringa and it means american lol. idk if in portuguese is a bad word (i guess it isn't) but i can 100% confirm in spanish it's not the kindest word to refer to americans hehe.
You should've used the law & order sound for the end of the video LOL
an descubierto el secreto latino, los que hablan ingles son gringos xdxd
You have such a distinct style, outside of how your nails and your setup look - the way you paint the polish, the way you show it in the bottle...it’s pretty weak for people to try and steal that 😂
Hey, Cristine! That ad with your face is in brazilian portuguese. The word "gringo" started as a mean way to call the colonizers, but today we mostly use it to refer to english speakers, and sometimes european countries. From the way its frased, it isn't mean, it just says "this is such a trend in north america". We also use just "vem da gringa" to refer to a generalized foreign country, like "it comes from other countries". But yeah just wanted to clarify that, what they did was pretty awful and it's not a famous brand (I don't know it, at least), which is probably why they thought they could get away with it. You have a lot of fans in Brazil! I love your work, been watching since 2017 :)
Just discovered youtube had taken my subscription from mamma holo! No wonder I wasnt getting notifications!
no one cares
"I can't read Spanish"  That's not Spanish XD
that wasn't Spanish hehehe was Portuguese ( from Brazil)  <<3<3<3 kisses from Portugal
SO off topic, but I think you'd look great with shoulder length hair but whatever you wanna do!! :))))
You need to pay for foot picks😂😂
They are basically stealing your creativity, hard work and kind of your identity.......criminal. Sue them all.
THATS NOT SPANISH😭😭😭😭
I'm so glad the only ads I ever get relating to nail polish are from the real Holo Taco account :)
It’s Portugueeeeese🤦🏼‍♀️ hahhahah not Spanish
I've personally returned a guilty verdict.
6:18 that isn't Spanish, I believe that is Portuguese
“I can’t read spanish” honey thats portuguese
girl stop how do you know they don't to that themselves  and this is stupid
I got a canadian tuxedo ad on this video o:
Video idea you buy the products that used your pictures and see if they are any good 😂
6:19 It’s not Spanish, it’s Portuguese, and I’m so sorry that “we” used your image. The ad says: get your kit with free “deliver”(I dunno how to say it in English, it’s that thing where u have to pay to receive the object in your home), and get a prize(which is a cabin that get your nails dry). And the “a nova febre entre as gringas” means that it’s famous among you guys, gringas means girls from United States principally, but we say it for another countries too. I’m sorry again, and sorry about my bad English too! Omg I’m so embarrassed
are you really using those earbuds, theyre like 800 years old
That's portuguese you were trying to translate. It means "The new trend among the foreigners"
*Send all the haters to simply court*
I don't know if this might interest anyone, but in China (so for some chinese companies), there is little to no intellectual property in the business world! It's part of their business culture to share or steal ideas so that truly the best get to the top. Its also a great way to make quick bucks like you said. That doesn't make it ok of course (I really find this horrible), but it might be a possible explanation... as for other companies, well they just suck!
This is Portuguese, Christine!! Gringa is not mean, it’s just a way of referring to foreigners!
As a half Spanish speaker gringa or gringo is commonly used as slang for white chick or white boy. Just derogatory white person
I'm loving to see Brazilians in here explaining the words to her. FAAALA GALERA
I’m so happy that you look much better now and you actually look so good today! I feel like you have done something different with your skin and hair but you’re radiating! I’m really sorry about the people stealing your content! And you’re quite a decent person for not sharing the nail salon names! Love you and Ben a lot! I think one of my all time favorite couple ever 💜 love all that way from Cairo , 🇪🇬 Egypt
So... "You all are my simply detectives" Why did my brain go "Detectives > Private detectives > Private Dick > Simply Dicklogical!" ... (I'm so sorry. LOL!)
we all need watermarks on the middle of videos so people can’t copy your videos
My mouth is gaping open at 9:16 unbelievable

Hi from Canada! I realized I sort of do this. I'm just the office person at my local legion and the guys are old fashioned so they aren't familiar with social media, so I help. I made a fish fry ad and just googled fish fry and took a photo from Google images. Figured it's fish and chips, no ours don't serve on that plate but who cares. I now realize the owner cares and I'll change it and my future actions. Thanks for the heads up
#7 on trending😊
6:18 that’s not spanish that’s portuguese 😒
"increase your femininity"
I'll just point the minor irony of Simply rebranding a Home Depot mallet as HoloTaco by putting stickers on it but not bothering to take off the Home Depot sticker...
The second one to gringa is right and it is mean
then place watermark to middle so they cant cut thoes CD
hi, i'm from brazil! the language on one of the videos is portuguese, not spanish. and don't worry, "gringa" is not a necessary mean word, it just means that the person came from a rich/white country. most ppl just use it to say they met a foreign in a informal way. ly 🥰
No nails here but I can’t afford advertising so please Check out www.locogains.co.uk  £5 off with promo code high5  Just a quick look really helps

That's not spanish, it's portuguese.
The english translation of the arabic text is "latest nail polish technology 💅 is a printer that would draw anything in your phone ♥ on your nails for 38 sec...  Exclusive and only in Algeria" The last line I think is the website's name to buy the product

As a fellow old person... (Younge people, write below)
6:06-6:22 translation of Portuguese ad (please excuse mistakes, I am actually a Spanish speaker and doing my best to give a rough sense!): "the new fever among the Gringas (White North American women)" "Now in Brazil". Next part I am not sure if poligel is some sort of nail term or "polygonal," so I am going with the nail term, probably referring to gel polishes, "Poligel lengthening can now be done at home!" "Promise long and strong nails for up to 20 days." "Secure your own kit with free shipping!" "And win a free UV nail dryer as a gift!" About what you would expect I think - please correct my translation if you are a native (Brazilian) Portuguese speaker!
ok cristine your hair looks amazing tho
cristine what did you do? you look so gorgeous, not that you don’t any other day but you look so different in a good way and I love it
6:21 its not spanish, its portuguese i think
a gringo is what hispanics call white people or wannabe hispanic for example i had friends over and my dad called them a gringo cus she try to speak spanish but she no one knew what she was saying
I don’t care
"Gringo" or "Gringa" is not an insult btw, it's the demonym we (most Latinos and Latinas) use to refer to a person from the United States. "Americans" is not quite right because everyone born in the continent is American... you know jajaja. Like if English people were referred to as "Europeans" but JUST English people, no one else, and that the rest have other demonyms... doesn't make sense😆.
Also, remember if it's on Instagram you can report it for false advertisement
I'm sad
Looking forward to the day Holo Taco launches a nail oil pen!
Gringo it's basically foreign in portuguese lol. Cade os BR aqui kkks
s.....sSpanish!?!?!!!? It even says the name of the coutry in it! crHHHHHistine I am very disappointed ! hahaahahaha
Get ready to get SimplySued
Omg shes trying to speak portuguese loll, and saying it's spanish sos
They are also selling your polish’s also. As taco polish
This video has made me realize how long I've been watching you simply... I'm 14 I've been watching since I was 9! How I feel like your older videos where posted only a week ago!
Cristine: "I can't read spanish" Me (honduran holosexual): "🤣 THAT'S NOT SPANISH!"
“Gringos” means Americans in a mean connotation for us Latin people
i dont know why but the exhibit music really started to make me laugh as it continued to build. nice
Imitation is the greatest form of flattery
C: I don’t know, I don’t know Spanish  Yeah I can see because that’s not Spanish girl 😂
What's that booty look like?
PS: That was not spanish, it was portuguese!  It's so bizarre to go past nail salons and hair salons and see photos of influencers and hollywood artists. At least around my area, most of them do it, and they're usually very small businesses with people who don't know any better.

Kkkk the Ad is not in Spanish it’s in Portuguese.   You got right! Is says the new hottest trend between foreigners woman. And gringa/gringo it’s a word use in Latin American to refer do foreigners and it’s not pejorative.
Thank goodness you didn't buy that stuff. It does not make sense to me when people buy stuff to show off what they don't support.
Lol at Cristine..."Wait...the button doesn't turn green...it turns grey...EW..Why." 😂😂😂😂
I hope you got permission from holotaco.com to use them in your intro 😂
Bible prophecies are happening like never before, we're in the end times. Are you saved by believing in the Blood Atonement of Jesus Christ? John 3:16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have everlasting life. Christ said, "Come to Me as you are." It's not about not sinning (we should as we're thankful and build heavenly treasures), it's about having faith from the heart that Jesus lived the perfect life we couldn't and died for ALL our sins and raised up proving who He is and that  is God in human form and you're given the free Gift of eternal life. On the cross Jesus said, "It is FINISHED!" The Blood of Christ IS enough! God wants to give you salvation from damnation, all you have to do is believe in your heart and have faith in what Christ has done for us.

Im now curious if you used a certain nail product in a video, how would you feel if that company used the pictures of it? i know its still stealing, and using your image but it is an accurate ad for them as it is their product. would it be made any better if you were given credit and were named?
Me: at least they didn't steal Ben *14min in they steal ben* Me: beyyyyyyn no!
The only thing I have seen are Facebook ads for Holotaco. The first time saw then it concerned me, but I think they are legit.
Would it help to put your watermark around your cuticles in pictures or multiple places on your work? I hate them doing this to you.
Going to link this video anytime someone steals your content 😂😂  I think of hair salons doing the same thing lol with like younger hairstyles and the 80s looking lol but really i want to see nails they did and what they can do well. I’m glad you didn’t support them. Next time see who you can message and ALMOST buy lol see how far you can go and teach them a lesson lol
It’s Brazilian Portuguese NOT Spanish!!!! Lolll 😂 it wasn’t meant to be mean, it meant something like “the new trend in between the foreign people” 😂😂
Who's gonna tell her that that add was in Portuguese and not Spanish. When she translated it from spanish to english I couldn't stop laughing
I have a little less anger towards to the nail shops in a way....
.........
video in portuguese: cristine: i can't read spanish  okay...
Just saying- Simply would look incredible with short hair.. ~sips tea~
We have a Creator, God. The Bible states that ‘the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;’  ‭‭Romans‬ ‭@‬ ‭ 1:18  The Bible also states that the wages of sin is death. So because of mankind’s sin and error and also by God’s Holy standard we are all sinners, no one is good and because God is just and Holy we are all deserving of death/eternal damnation(hell). But God being rich in mercy provided a way out for mankind because although we can’t earn our way into heaven He gave us a gift, Eternal Life in Jesus Christ. Over 2000 years ago God came in the flesh as Jesus Christ, walked a sinless life, and was put to death by Crucifixion. He died to pay our wages of sin and 3 days later rose from the dead. Jesus Christ went back into heaven and promises one day that He’ll come back, this time to judge the world. So what is the free gift? Salvation!  “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.” John @-16-17   Believe in Jesus Christ, He Loves you enough to have died for you in order to save you from being eternally separated from Him! If you would repent of your sins which means to regret and turn away from(having a changed mind) and confess and accept Jesus Christ by Faith as your Lord and Savior, the Holy Spirit which is the spirit of God will live on the inside of you and make you His Child and help you live a better life for His purposes and to live a righteous Life by His Spirit and Power.  Choose Jesus 🙏
That was not spanish but yes
6:23 "I can't read it because I don't know spanish." As a brazillian, that quote hurted. We speak portuguese and it's the biggest country on south america. Come on Simplymomlogical!
She got a tan :0
It's not spanish!!! It's portuguese
Christine you should make a video of buying your products or going to the store I am offered to use the things that they stole from you like the picture
7:31 it says that the latest technology that will draw any picture from your phone on your nail in 35 seconds
I think that is terrible and they should be ashamed of themselves.
Reminds me of a video of that kind of topic from the german youtubers space radio. The video is called something like Deutsches Dönergesicht. If you speak german then you should watch it. It's funny.
simplynailLAWgical
A part of me died a little when Cristine called brazilian portuguese "spanish" ngl hfusahuifshuifahsuf
Gringo started I think in Mexico but I'm not sure when U.S.A. soldiers were invading and the people knew the color of their suits were green so they just started yelling them "Green go!" and that started to be a name to refer to someone mainly from the U.S.A but it does apply to white people. It is not a bad thing though, it can be but it isn't.
10:35 looks photoshopped, badly.
All the dislikes are from companies which got called out :D
"Can't read spanish" That made me laugh, because it is actually portugueseee
WHERE IS THE SIMPLY MAILOGICALSS
I got a Holo Taco add on this video 😁😁😁
Steal nails get the hammer... Steal election get corporate love.
Good 😊
6:39 Sooooo.... first off not spanish, second off I'm Mexican and "gringa" means foreigner and is especially used for American girls. It was based off of when in war the Americans, to signal attack, would say "Green go!" because of the color of their uniforms. And since the spanish didn't understand, they heard "gringo" and used it to describe foreign (usually white) men,  and for women the term is "gringa". It was never meant to be used badly, but people can take things the wrong way. Sorry for the rant, and also no hate only Holo!
I’d be like “Hey, I saw you used my Picks and Videos, sooo at least send me some free stuff” 🤣🤣🤣
Its not spanish hun

Maybe you should actually "trademark" your shit.  Just saying.
Because I’m dumb I didn’t look at the thumbnail and thought someone legit took your nails...
It's not spanish 😂 (I am spanish), btw, what a jerk of shit companies
I agree with all points in this video, but I wanted to point out an interesting possibility: a VERY small minority of these companies might actually be the manufacturers of these products (the nail vinyls, for instance) trying to bypass the distributors with their markup, as many sellers on AliExpress actually are. Technically same factory, same product, just trying to reach the customer base directly, and they might feel entitled in that case to use the images. This is definitely more a thought experiment than anything, I'm sure Simply knows whether this is actually possible since she has worked directly with producers.
But GOT7's comeback Breath is tomorrow like HELLO???!! Check out the teaser https://youtu.be/6nKuDJuYMG8

The word "gringo" meaning "green go" comes from protesters  of war torn countries by U. S military troops invading their territories during the 70's & 80's. Protesters would chant: greens go home. And the word gringo (slang) was born. Now the word is used either as term of endearment and or derogatory towards North American Caucasians.
Lol the one with the printer is in Arabic and I believe specifically from Algeria by the flag. The loose and quick translation is "The latest in nail cosmetic technology, a printer that will print whatever picture you have on your phone onto your nails in 35 seconds ... Exclusive and only in Algeria" The last sentence is written in Arabic Algerian dialect but I from what I understood it says "click on the link and it will take you to the official website of this printer". Hope this clears things up!
My exes mom bought the "nail oil" for like 90€each
I wonder if nail salon owners just Google pictures for nails and then print them? Like they just think if they can't find it on Google its free.
Although these ads and stolen ideas are ridiculous, you made it entertaining LOL, you're also super sweet for not suing. So glad you didn't buy the products to!!
It wasn't Spanish it was Portuguese 😭
2020 has seemed to be a year that tests the boundaries of ethics and morality   Pretty pathetic  But hopefully people know not to buy things through these 3rd party sites
Yes I can confirm...... “gringas” means white girl 😂

I think you stole their stealing you hypocrite...
I didn't know that "gringo/a" was used in other parts of latin america (the clip is portuguese), I'm chilean (spanish speaking) and people use it a lot to talk about people from the EE.UU, as they don't have a proper demonym (I hope one day the world understands that "america" is a continent, not a country)

it was so funny when she was translating the gringo one 🤣
I can't stand when I see content where the watermark was cut off & the theif doesn't even give credit to the creator but tries to pass it off as their own 😒 I see this on IG all the time!! Always give credit where it's due. Creators work hard to give you quality content & without them some of y'all wouldn't even have a following. Period
I got myself a mug of tea for this video
Its trending in Australia 🤣
HELP SOMEONE GET THAT HAMMER AWAY FROM HER 😭
Not spanish. At least I don't understand it 🤷🏽‍♀️
gringa can also mean white girl lolol
You should buy these and test them out
What happened to the watermark????????

6:18 that's not spanish that's portuguese from brazil T^T
Cristine, pqp em KKKKKK onde já se viu Brasil falar espanhol, esperava mais 🥴
You should edit out the part where you say there’s nothing you can do about the infringement because a lot of people will see that and even further abuse your content because they know there’s no repercussions.
I would recommend talking to Legal Eagle to see the proper the avenues to pursue.
Guy tang has a product line called midentity lol
Besides the ad in portuguese (btw, it say something like "the new hot trend among the "gringas" (which means something like "foreign" in Brazil) now in Brazil. The polygel nails can be done at home, and promises big and resistant nails for up to 20 days. Guarantee your kit with free shipping and get a free UV nail lamp"), the content and even image stolen have been a real long standing problem. I've already seen hair salon with photos of famous people, like Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Zayn, and others; online shops doing publicity with others content; even the type of instagram profile that just posts something like "satisfying videos" and things like that posting stolen content without any credits or authorization. Taking into consideration the size of the problem, I didn't think that it will be solved too soon (unfortunately). But I'll keep reporting this kind of thing and don't supporting the companies that do this. And hopefully, one day, on a utopian, happy and ideal society, this won't happen anymore.
Hi 👋 nis to meet you I have never said something to you
The picture of Ben in the background... I can't, hahahaha. These people are so bad at covering up their shady practices.
For the little gel things that they used your face 6:15 that’s not Spanish 😭😭
Dip powder nails is popular because if you google image search for dip powder nails it shows up. I think they were just looking for a header image for their menu
My mom almost bought this product from Wish and I told her “yknow you’re just getting a cheap knockoff version of the product, if it even gets to you.” She was ok with paying for cheap, but I implored her to buy from the original creator because of how important it is to support small creators
I want that simply hammer
We could always go back to the days where you have a giant translucent watermark covering the entire screen :) haha

"Oh, no, some company used a picture of my nails!!! Whatever shall I do?!" If you're mad at these companies using these pictures for profit then this video is hypocritical in it of itself because it's for profit too.
Why is this shit even showing on my feed. You didn’t invent the nail painting technique sorry to break it to ya
With her hair on the other side, Cristine looks so much more like Jen it's crazy
Wow how can I give you more money and convince other people to give you more money. Clearly your broke and ain't getting enough for the life-changing and life saving  work you're doing!
It would be great if you went in and said you're not doing it right let me show you.  Then do it exactly like the picture  smile then walk out.  Please make a video of you do it!
And this is why you should never purchase anything you see in a FB ad without doing a ton of homework. My aunt feel for an add for some too good to be true foundation product and got scammed out of $280.
Whats next? Her long hair on the pages of small shampoo brands? Cause i think that might happen😂🙃
I guess the best thing to do is report the ads. You know how most platforms that have ads offer an option to report them if they're inappropriate? Let's just mass report these advertisers as "scam or misleading" "fake product" or other options like that until the platform decides to stop running the stolen ad, that's what I do...
Each of your videos is very beautiful 😍😍
anyone from lmanburg here?.
Cristineeee!!!!!!! That “spanish videoo” isn’t spanish lol it is Portuguese!!!

Privileged youtuber wants more money
I've seen these stolen images on Insta as well. What I wonder, is why can creators never use music in the background or their revenue will get annexed? But can't you do anything against this? You should be able to annex their revenue they got from advertising worth your work as well right? Copyright shouldn't only work against you, it should also work for you...🤔 btw, I don't have Twitter so I never tweet them to you but ill start commenting STOLEN below these ads
I have definitely been browsing nail products on foreign websites before and been like: "Well, I'm pretty sure those are Christine's nails..." Which means I don't buy that product because obviously, its not going to look anything like the picture
My mom has a business and she makes cheer bows. This happened to her too and the sad thing is that it was from a relative who lives out of the US. She stole my mom's photos and used them to advertise as if they were her products without my mom's permission. I don't understand why people do this and earn profit off of other people's hard work by claiming it as their own.
Guessing those salons are buying posters from a salon supply company. You could probably call the salons and ask them to take it down. Or make your own posters to sell to nail salons.
In Brazil we don't speak spanish, we speak portuguese omg🤣
The holo hammer of justice
thank you for not buying the fake shit to compare it to your own original stuff. i really hate this trend where people support those bad companies just to make a "comparison video". while i understand what they are trying to do (educating etc) but they are still giving them attention and money
Still love you tho ❤️
Cristine's photo in the thumbnail looks exactly like Jen i thought she invited her to roast these companies together 😂
Christine looked so much like Jen in that thumbnail! 😄
Please do a collab with James Charles
Can you pleeeaaaaseeee ship your nail polish to Australia x
Beautiful Nails  Watch my creativity, support me, I am only 9 years old
It wasn't spanish, it was portuguese 🤭🤭
imagine if they did use pics of christine's feet to sell press on toenails, but they used the pics from the year where she didn't remove her toenail polish
I’m from Latin America and gringa/o mostly just means American😂 and it’s not necessarily used in a bad way
Some latinos use the term Gringo/gringa to describe the English speakers or some just the North americans. Its like a pun, here in PR historically people used it because they didn’t knew much english when the US government colonized/invaded us (kinda) and the only thing  they could say was “Green go” referring to the US military soldiers. That’s why Gringo=green go ended being a way to call the North americans.
Bruh its just nails who cares
1) This is despicable behaviour! but I guess they know that people won't sue them :( 2) the Irony of the dip powder poster with the $250 fine sign :)
Hi
Is not Spanish, is portuguese. Gringa is the female version of gringo, we don't use the "white person" frase because if your skin is light you are white no matter the region you are from. Gringo is not necessarily a derogatory term.
This reminds me of companies stealing people's art to sell tshirts and similar items
Soo, holo taco mirror polish next?

It is so weird that so many nail salons stole that one dip powder image. I wonder if it is like the first thing that pops up on google images or something 🧐
AAAAA ITS PORTUGUESE NOT SPANISH :(
Everyone follow coolking logan on youtube. Poor guy has brain cancer, might not make it, and only wants to be a youtube star. Lets unite for once internet and go to him
Yeah, that Brazil ad basically said "The new fever amongst white girls". Highlights the colorism that is in Latino America 😪
0:01 And I have had enough of hearing your really terrible voice just stick to ONLY nails Please and thanks
TROOM TROOM must be behind this.
Over here like, "Lafayette, LA? Louisiana?" Kind of surprised there was one this close (?) to me. 😅😓
i got foot pics taken by a friend photographer stolen for some overseas sites hopefully not for weird purposes but still sux normally the friend whontook them puts his watermarks on but hmm 🤷🏻‍♀️
She:turn that red button green  Me:wa-
On mу chаnnеl there wаs a video 101 IMPOSTЕR vs 1001 PLАYERS, do not miss this еpic bаttle
Just a guess, but I think the salon signs must be coming from either a print shop or stock photo site that's stealing the thumbnails. There's shops on Etsy that sell store displays too. It's suspicious they all use the same image, and it would take some photoshop skills to increase a thumbnail size and not look like shit.
#4 in tending!! Nice love ya!  ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
I lost it when I saw the picture of ben in the background
Wait until Danny Gonzales sees the special sticker on that mallet
I love how you handled this. And I love how my minimal Spanish classes let me recognize that wasn't Spanish, lmao 😆
I haven't seen any updates on your allergies/flare-ups (maybe I missed them...). Just wanted to know how you are doing. :) Your eyes are looking better these days.
In Latin America we use gringo refering to basically anyone who looks white or speaks english. I wouldn't consider it mean, tho. A lot of Latinos have a good impression of English speaking countries like the US or Canada, even if they've never been there...  Anyways, tons of support from Venezuela!! and sorry if my english is a lil bit awkward lol
That's not Spanish that's Portuguese lmaooooo
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.”  #LordJesusiscoming
I was waiting for this video for AGES😩🙏🏻💿
Wouldnt the real companies you get your products from have a problem with their products being used in someone else's 3rd rate companie ad?
Flood the ad comments with where the real product can be found
Random thought but I noticed that she did her hair this video, she probably misses the creative outlet that she got from doing her makeup. Since she cant put makeup on right now, shes doing her hair to make up for it. idk, just a thought. i love putting on makeup, i get alot of enjoy out of it. Im sure id miss it and start to do my hair more if i was in her situation. Nevertheless, Cristine always looks beautiful.
CRISTINE YOU LOOK SO PRETTY WHAT THE HECK
Jordan says hi, (and I'm sure he'd also like to let you know he's smooth)
I think they're getting the thumbnails by just Google dip powder and choosing the 1st image.
my cat purrs to the beat of the intro, i thought this was important
where are you naild
Your punishment is...    White. Creme.

Omg she is on trendingg...😳😳  Like Number 4???
I thought it was Jen in the thumb nail
11:45 HELLO THIS IS CHEF JOHN FROM FOODWISHES.COM
You uploaded to youtube, you're not going to win any lawsuit. You're just worried about your youtube revenue tanking with the new changes. Good luck this channel sucks.
Wonder if she sister sued any of them
I’m searching high and searching low but still can’t find who the fuck asked
,love your stuff got me in to nails ps I'm a girl
Um WHY WAS MY AD ABOUT POOP AND HOW TO Make it smell better 😅🤣
Grace is right first
You looked really pretty today idk what it is ( also nice viddereoooooo) x
They are using your face because you might not realize but you are quite a hit down here in Brazil, and that wall FULL OF NAIL POLISH IS DUCKING AWESOME
TRANSLATION OF THE POLYGEL AD The hottest trends amongst North America's nailart community, now has come to Brazil! Polygel can be done at home and give you strong, lasting nails for up to 20 days Buy your kit right now, free shipping and take for free a UV light chamber
i've seen a similar video from a german youtuber where she showed different ways and companies. the one that stood out for me the most was a "luxury" brothel who listed her as one of the "girls" to "play" with. and even though she was 18+ at that time, it's still a scandal. imagine you have a job interview and the company yo want to work for found this on the internet with your face.
Somehow this never showed up for me
I saw a small business who had to use physical watermarks. Like she made a wooden cut out with her business name to try to stop people from stealing her images
See my review on CICAPAIR TIGER GRASS CAMO DROPS on IG https://www.instagram.com/p/CH5MMM4D1Hk/?igshid=1kh5r2ooef6qv
Collab with Brad mondo plz XD
An old man told me "You can't own it unless you can strap it to your back or defend it with your life"
I wonder if the dip powder thumbnail comes up in an image search and people are looking up images to make their signs and dont realize that just because its online doesn't mean you can't just print them out and use them.
It was not spanish, it was brazillian portuguese...this add is from Brazil. And yes, it meant that whatever it was that they were advertising, allegedly it was the new hottest trend overseas for women
Simply is on trend with the legal themed YouTube videos coming out lately 😂
Thats not spanish 😂 its portuguese. From brasil. They called you gringa as well 😭😂😂 i can't.....
YOO GIRL I am a huge fan!
NÃO É ESPANHOL!!! Simply is so smart but does not even know that in Brazil we have PORTUGUESE as our language!
slay queeen
I don’t think I have ever seen her wt her hair down like that before, you look great cristine
Each time you say well hello everyone it's me Cristine again , i say Heeelloooo Crisstiiiiiiine
I’m just saying you should sue them. This is pure bullshit getting money using your content
Hey gringa hahaha gringa is someone from outside Brazil 🇧🇷 hahaha that don’t speak Portuguese
I'm sorry I can't turn it green☹
no one       simply: Naildentity          😂👏✨
I think the nail salons probably just Google 'chrome nails' or something like that and pick an image and print it out. Yours are probably the top result bc you're videos are popular. Still very illegal tho lol.
I'm so sad I can't buy any of your nailpolish
The clips of the multichrome powder on Cristine's face just made me realise that there actually might have been some serious effects considering the skin issues she has now :O
I’m not here to wreck your day.. Daddy obviously did that long ago as you’re looking for so much adornment and it’s pathetic!!!
I was like listening to Cristine talk, but my eyes were looking at the hammer and the holo taco logo shining in the camera
Quick question, when are you selling that nail oil on Halo Taco?
The hot newest trend amongst white girls 🤣
Like si fuiste las tendecia de estados unidos
Nintendo is being canceled all around
Number 1: home depot
Damn some people are weasels🤦🏽‍♀️
Is that a mallet instead of a hammer? 😭😭
Description made me laugh. "Stuff shown in this video: My own (...) footage. Thank you very much."

6:17 It's actually Portuguese
What a useless b!! in every use of the term
I wonder if these companies can get in trouble if they use the holo taco videos/stills to pass as their own. Its trademarked so I wonder.
7:32 This is the Arabic language and the page explain the nail printer and how it works and if you want it it's available in Algeria
You look so pretty today just saying 😊
Cristine the Call Out queen
Her Brazilian accent "Grin-gah"
*Simply savage has entered the chat*
...its nails you know the thing that 99.9% of people have and its art something that is almost impossible to copyright unless its in a museum and even then their is still copies and joke forms of it so who cares if they are using a picture of your nails their are already a million pictures of random peoples nail art on google and their is no way to charge money for every image now grow up move on and get off the trending page
she watch h3 too much
https://youtu.be/yX_mXutvEZ8
Portuguese giiiiirl 😂
SimplyCourtLogical
The add using your face is actually written in Portuguese, and they called you a gringa 😂 it literally says “a new fever among gringas”
THE NEW FEVER AMONG GRINGAS hahahha it's not mean, Cristine. It can be mean in Spanish-speaking countries, but in Brazil, it just means "foreigner".
Its not Spanish 😭😭 Its ✨portuguese✨
Please sell those Holo taco logo stickers!  I cannot successfully peel them off of product boxes when they arrive like I can a good peely with Peel Off Base by Holo Taco
Someone call Emily D Baker!
Can’t you just sue companies?
I  thought this was an old video and I was going to have some rewatch fun but no it was new content... yay... I never get to watch new videos I'm always late...
You became a hand model lol
Nothing is yours, Cristine.
So i looked up fake nails, pretty nails. I know the worst thing happened. Your nails were all over the website. I was shocked.
Christine that wasn't Spanish it was Brazillian Portuguese
When you get a Holo Taco ad on Cristine’s video.
wow I didn't know Ben was up for sell oml💀
Me: why chirstine look different? *After noticing for 2 minutes* straight.. Me: ohhh her open hair.
Anyone else notice how her skin is looking so good and literally glowing?!
6:07 *says Brazil🇧🇷*  Simply: I have no idea what’s going on or what’s being written bc I don’t speak Spanish 😃  Brazil: well guys Portuguese is no longer our official language. Good day! 🎩😁
Only losers steal!!  Do not support thiefs.
They steal your likeness because you are so beautiful methinks...
Dang, she is looking old.
Ok in Spain we have a word that will make all of that companies pay for using your footage. Just say really firmly "PA-GA-ME" and you'll get it
Hi criatine i did not steal your naildentity why you not making nail art ps i love you this is just funny👍🏻
Theres so much wrong with the section where she didnt understand the language omg it being portuguese, saying grigo = white nfndndnd
I just realised how much you look like Jen in this video 👀   Is it just me or can other long time viewers see the major resemblance too?
All I can say to these thieves is !S.H.A.M.E! and as an artist, this type of things really pushes my buttons!  If you are unsure of a site that has a picture that looks familiar, you can backtrack in on google, do a search if it´s anywhere else on the internet.... Personally, I would never buy from someone who steals anything from another, that just shows that the seller behind it ain´t trustworthy, I would leave them a SHAME comment and (if possible) contact the owner of the stolen picture/video (or whatever it is) and move on. It´s annoying that you can´t get them legally due to border issues....cos they do deserve to slapped by the hands of law and pay for their crimes! NOT ok! On a happier note, have a wonderful day :) 💜
I sent a dm about the Kivei ads on Facebook...
Is this also a merch teaser for Holo Taco mallet?
She should make up some actually good nail hacks and wait and see how long it takes Troom Troom to use them lol
Bootiful hair
I just love it when she says WEOW... its like gods promise
Young Ally Sheedy
I think that those people should stop. That is actually illegal because they are stealing your identity.
On a different note ... Christine your hair looks really good. (Healthy/Glossy etc) Are you using different products or something??
Hi
I love your videos 💜
You should visit one of those salons and record their reaction when they see you lol
Just take a moment to appreciate Cristine coz she managed to put the links of everything on her discription 🖤
Omg did she do something different to her hair 😲😲😲😲
What a thieves
I am very drunk and this was somehow the only video I clicked on that stopped that spinning so thanks babe
I am most shocked about the video with beyyyns nails.😳
CRISTINE!!!!! YOU'RE 4TH ON TRENDING!!!!!!!!! YAYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!! IVE BEEN HERE SINCE POLISH MOUNTAIN AND IM SO HAPPY YAYAYAYYAYAYAY :D
Someone gave Cristine that holo gavel, she took one look and said   "I know what I'm gonna do with this bad boy"
6:19 Cristine it's portuguese not spanish xD And yes, it means the new hot trend among gringas
When Cristine has more evidence for her case than Trump and his entire campaign and law team lol
The nova nail pollygel was a add you had in this video right before you mentioned them.
My cousin saw me watching and said: she should just title the video "being famous is troublesome"
It's just so sad how grown ups owning a business decide to go the easy/quick & dishonest way to make profit rather than just ACTUALLY WORK for it.
big brain moves
Me watching this video at 3:00 in the morning be like   👁👄👁 Some people are really shady  Now I knwo
Copyright is so 2008 - change my mind...

NOOOOOO ITS NOT SPANISHHH ITS PORTUGUESE 😭😭😭😂😂♥️
Dear friends Jesus Christ is ALWAYS WITH YOU! Upon accepting this truth, these 3 words will become like a safety net for you, protecting you from falling into despair. Because we are human, we will always have ups and downs in our life experiences. But the promise of the Presence of our Lord and Savior limits how far down we can go. Sometimes you may feel as if you are in free fall when people or things you had counted on let you down.           Yet as soon as you remember that JESUS IS WITH YOU, your perspective changes radically. You can look to Jesus for hope and help. Dear ones, not only is Yeshua (Jesus) with you but He will hold you by your right hand, guide you, counsel you, and take you into His Glory. All you have to do is say YES to Him this very moment and receive the promises of his unfathomable love.               I welcome you to receive our Creator THIS VERY MOMENT by first acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Abba Yahweh (Father God) through Yeshua (Jesus the Christ) into your life. Receive grace by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. Confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior whom died on the cross for the sins of ALL human-kind, arose in the 3rd day and currently sits on the right hand of God the Father Almighty. You will then be justified in salvation and forever blessed with His abundant love by the Holy Spirit!  ❤️❤️❤️                                                                                                                                                     (Zaphaniah 3 : 17;  John 6 : 55-59;  Psalms 73 : 23-26)
I think you should buy some of these products and check if they are same and expose them... I don't think the Real company who produced the products will do something like this...
Unfortunately, from what i've seen, instagram has a license to share what you post on the app with it's "affiliates" and to use it royalty-free worldwide with a transferrable license. While these examples mostly don't show examples of this, it is something to keep in mind when seeing stolen content.
she handles this so well omg
Sorry that was me
I dont understand what you mean.....
I can bet those 500 dislikes are by the companies Cristine just exposed lol
Hey kinda unrelated, but I think you are fun, funny, kind, and talented at what you do. I appreciate you and your team's hard work. It brings a smile to my face every time I watch your videos. Thank you for being yourself in such an unapologetic way. 🙂
2:31 .... simply detectives. Are you the person responsible for SIMPLY Lemonade? Thats my favorite drink!
Y’all know she’s serious when she has files and a hammer-
If they were gonna sell socks they would put your whole body duh...
Christine a new dimension of 3D HOLO was made and you need to check it out! https://youtu.be/aTB2ryoWIFU
Yes, im gonna comment the same as everyone.  As a spanish native speaker: that is not spanish
When you don't upload often I stop getting notifications for your videos.
You profit off of insecurities of young girl.  No sympathy for you getting ripped off.
This ain’t related to the vid like at all but but u look really pretty today and I hope u know that! Not that I don’t always look stunning but I just noticed it today idk why I just did anyway HAVE A GOOD DAY
I’m crying over the fact that Ben made it in to one of the ads
Gringa means white girl.
I bite my toe nails and eat them👅🦶
You look stunning
Cristine having too much fun whacking that mallet is a MOOD
i thought ure jen on the thumbnail
these places really said, Google image search ✨❤️ no i don't need to see the source link 💋💅🏿
Is it just me or when she mentioned selling feet pics I thought of when she did the spa at home wit Ben
Cristine's hair looks soooooooooooo good
just wanted to point out how amazing your skin is looking, like I hope you've been healing and feeling much better! XO
I want a Holo Taco Sticker!!!!
"They probably steal my hair." AHAHSHDFR
hah ur subscribe button turns gray lol mine turns rainbow
I need that hammmer😄
Cristine!!! HOLO cake!!! By how to cook that. Can you react to this please?
Comment
You should buy some of the stuff theyre advertising using you
New to the channel. Here cause she is cute. Thanks.
Has Christine dyed her hair? I like it :)
try this : https://youtu.be/yBvsNueXIw4
WISH MUST BE ON THE LIST.
For some reason the thought crossed my mind, imagine if one of the companies sued Cristine for using their advertising in her video!!??
Why isn't anybody talking about how she has her hair down????
Honey,  THAT WAS NOT SPANISH 😒
can i just say i have that exact green and blue pillow in the background
I wonder what would happen, if let's say 300 Beauty Youtubers stood up together and even got the traditional media on board and sued all these companies. I think it would really be possible to create a shitstorm, so even people who don't normally watch Beauty Youtubers would get to know about this problem. (There have been law suits in the EU, which have gained much popularity, and I know these kinds of collectice lawsuits are a thing in the States)
Am I the only one who check yt everyday just if christine posted earlier beacause i love her content? no? okei
Love your vids so coooooolllllllll
I love her personality 🙂🙂
Why do you have a holo taco mallet lmao 😂
https://youtu.be/2pcMcJfnJt8
You look like you might be feeling better, and I surely hope so🙏🏻 I’m sorry so many have stolen your creative property. While that must irk you to no end, at the end of the day, please just remember that you’re great at what you do or they wouldn’t want to use your creations.  You are loved, by many and it shows in their quest to notify you. I love how much positivity can come from a negative act. (Well many actually but I’m sure you’re aware) Be well and be sure that you, and your creativity are valued❤️
Number 4 trendinggggg
I would love to see you walk into a nail salon and be like “oh hey those nails look familiar. Oh wait, they’re mine!”
People comment so Simply gets a haircut in a salon pls.🥺  WE NEED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.
#4 no. in trend
luv your hair
Every other shot is a zooming effect. Damn
You should go to a nail salon for a video and get your nails done
Christine looks old now......... Sorry...cristine
I haven’t watched your videos in ages, but I’m back baby! 🥰💿
6:10 that's portuguese not spanish
I assume the salons are doing it as a "want Simply nails, but can't do it?  We can do it!  Plz come here!" Still sucks, but at least it's "we have this service" instead of "we have knock off products to sell".
But did you get permission to use their images in your video?
7:34 this says "the latest nail decorating technology💅 and its a printer that paints on your nails, pictures from your phone ❤ in less than 35 seconds...available now only in Algeria. " hope this clears the fuckery up ❤
The one in Arabic actually translated what you wrote latterly minus the YouTube channel shoutout km guessing they’re selling it.. But they still shouldn’t have used your face
👀 look
Soooooo are Holo Taco stickers going to become a thing???
did she get a tan????? LMAO
Does anybody else attempt to cheat on their wife and fail miserably or is it just me? God Damn I am Pathetic........
Cry me a river.
What if u dyed your hair with nail polish
When she said my name I almost fainted😃
34 on trending! This vid can so get higher 😈🔪
RIP office? What happen to you office & boss??
I don't know why I'm watching this... I don't have any nails at all    (I'm a man)
God I missed her on my recommend
I'm from El Salvador, we call "gringo" to the people of the United States, and white people in general "cheles"
Can we just talk about what is on her other hand? I mean that blue is beautiful
"and if they are here *troll grin* thanks for the view"
Cristine looks amazing in this video. Her skin and hair looks really good.
Was she the first to do hologram? Yea i doubt it she need to stop crying. If ur pic is out there, they're gonna use it. U did free promo with making youtube vids🤷‍♀️ youtubers are so entitled and greedy nowadays 🙄
You're trending, finally someone who' deserves it yess
its not right to do that she is absuloutely right
Does anyone remember when cristine had under 5k subs with captions and no face or voice. holo was not her brand yet and we disnt know about ben most importantly, i had no clue she was canadian
ELA TENTANDO ENTENDER OQ É GRINGA KKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
I thought gringas were slang for white girls lol
FINALLY! Been waiting for this video for a time as long as ur hair Christine!
I love that this is #4 on trending, she deserves it!!
You were right about the word “Gringa” it basically means a white girl😭😭
I’m getting h3 vibes lol I love her
Were my latinos at!?!?  From a Mexican holosexual  Te amamos Cristine (we love you)
U look so much like my friend hahah
“I can’t read Spanish” it was Portuguese lmaooo
OK so it seems like someone is distributing your thumbnail to these nail salons these nail salons might not even know they’re stealing your content
Numa dessas q a gnt descobre se tem br na área ♡
Wtf??
I’m a marketing grad student and you dropped some vocab words
the picture of been in the back had me cryingggg ah
tik tok is full of dodgy companies who steal footage and pretend to sell products to scam people... :/
Sooo all those times that I removed watermarks from stock images to put on my English PowerPoints are bad?! 😭 I’m sowy I thought if it’s on google images it’s allowed to be used. I removed watermarks cuz they were blocking the image...
It's crazy how she recognizes which video each one is from!! "Oh yeah that picture is from a video I did 3 years ago." She forgives but she never forgets I guess.
Someone send this Legal Eagle immediately!!!
THOSE ARE BEN'S NAILS! *I'm still laughing 😂.
It is suprisingly weird that they got you fotage without your tea lol
My sister's boyfriend is brazilian and he is teaching us portuguese. So I kinda understood some of what the ad said but it's just funny how she saw spanish and not portuguese 😂
I started doing nails over 30 years ago I see my work all over the internet. I am retired now and my work still pops up. I am sorry this is happening to you.
You should make nail oil!
Oh hey it’s simply lawlogical... wait what
Omg this is 4th on trending!! Love you Christine!!
Wait! There's no watermark on this video!
😂😂😂😂 why so many people gotta steal from simply
I like your nails
IT'S NUMBER 4 ON TRENDING !!!
Why are people disliking this? Oh wait its the old people who think dislike means that they dislike what happened to the person
I have had and still have people use pictures of my handsewn plushies and they don’t even have my pattern because I make up my own patterns.
The dislikes are the hundreds of people who stole your content :P
Girl just tattoo your watermark on your hand duh
Ok, I need to know where to buy that second mug!
I miss the times when you used to title things "betch" etc... loved that side of your personality.
the first thing i noticed and cared about this video was the fact that her hair was down
Oh noooo, waaahhh Baby

What if one of these companies is going to sue you, because they have been mentioned in this video without permission?? :D :D I need to know, if someone is that stupid ^^
Lmao. My last name is Amaya. I feel personally attacked lol
The one in Arabic exhibit c: latest technology for nail cosmetics, a printer that prints out any photo you have in your phone, in 35 seconds. ONLY IN ALGERIA ....
They are Lazy!
for the nail salons they probably just googled “dip powder nails” “ombré nails” “nail art” and printed it. i don’t know it’s what i think
What?!? No. 4 on trending!
Gringa or gringo means a white girl or white boy but it’s more of a diss like
Ben's face in the last part just TOOK ME OUT 😂
Okay, I’m not fluent by any sense of the word, but exhibit C said something about nail technology, and this printer will print any picture you have on your phone in 35 seconds, then it says something about Algeria, and I’m not getting much of the bold lettering above the picture; a couple of words that I forget the meaning of and a bunch of stuff that’s over my head. Something about a page, a drawing, and a printer 😂 we all get the idea😂
Today I learned, as an American, that Canada is apparently too far away from Mexico to recognize the slang "gringo." Like it's been such an old joke in American media for SO long...
I realised the mallot was holooooooo
wOAH I tHought this video was posted like 3 years ago- CRISTINE LOOKS LIKE BABY CRISTINE
Christine reminds me of Molly Cooper from Sherlock Holmes and I cannot unsee it
She should go to a nail salon that uses one of her pictures and make it obvious that she’s a YouTuber and simply nailogical and see what their response is.
She kind of looks like Pierson Wodzynski from far away...
All of the online ads using your images are obviously using them to make money and to trick people into thinking you use their products but for the salons that printed out pictures of the thumbnails they probably don't even know about your videos and just printed out the first images they found. I checked and the dip powder and multi-chrome nails come out at basically the top of google images when you search those words.
6:57 , I'm from Costa Rica we are called "Ticos", as native English speaker are called "Gringos" and Latin American people "Latinos"
Can you please try poly gel ??
Not Cristine reading first the wrong definition of "gringa" lmao
https://youtu.be/y2blhjKcRnA
That’s business babe!!!
https://youtu.be/y2blhjKcRnA
its hammer time
Stole your nails?? Your a freak.
That also happened to my brother😒
that keyquest music in the beginning just brought sadness out in me that i’ve been repressing for years
Nice
6:17 that’s not Spanish, Is Portuguese hahaha
Since I can read Arabic Exhibit C is an Algerian Instagram account selling " the NEWEST HOT Technology" they basically sell a printer that can print on your nail. Since Cris made a video about that before it kinda makes sense for them to use your picture which I'm totally against.
ok but is no one going to talk about the fact that the hammer she used is a Holo Taco hammer XDDD
me: [sees portuguese and the word 'brasil' in one of the ads] me: oh i wonder if she'll finally say anything about my country /positive connotation cristine: ...i don't speak spanish
This has nothing to do with the video...But I want to WARN you all in 💝. Please everyone choose Jesus as your Lord and Savior. All these natural disasters are lining up with Bible prophecy in Rev. We are getting closer to Jesus's return and judgement coming on the entire world. Please all repent with your mouth to God and admit we need a Savior Jesus Christ who died for all our sins. Believe and have faith in Jesus Christ and how he died on the cross for our sins and rose again. Invite the Holy Spirit ( being baptized ) into your life and turn from your sins. For those who don't repent and choose Jesus's gift of dying on the cross so we can have eternal life.. Things won't go well for them. I don't want to see anyone perish. I love you all, why I'm warning everyone daily and praying for the entire 🌎 daily. God bless you all!! I'm a sinner and I'm so grateful Jesus saved me from perishing. I keep seeking him daily and his commandments and they aren't burdensome, instead I have peace even when the world seems to be falling apart. God is on the throne, amen!!🙏💐😊💝
You know you can sue
Simply reading portuguese and thinking is spanish... There's just one thing left to Say: Chale 😂
yay
get saved in christ right now before it's to late. just pray that you believe he died for your sins and that he is your Lord and savior then tell him to enter your life. when you say this that dead spirit in you comes alive, your born again, soul is saved from hell, name written in the book of life. after that get to know god. repent and trust in God. serve god, you will be rewarded.
You  look like my 6th grade math teacher. Edit:I'm in 7th grade now
Gringo is a mexican/latino racial slur towards foreigners, especially white people. Popular in the 40's-60's (don't @ me if the date is wrong) it can be featured in the Elvis Presley movie "Fun in Acapulco (1963)," similar in fashion to the way America called African Americans "Negros" in this same time period. While common place back then, it does not really fit into todays society of knowledge and acceptance of others no matter their race or orientation, though recent times have proved that we need to relearn that lesion. So yeah...... just a slur
“So went here in simply court”  Has an actual hammer I-I can’t 😂 I’m so excited I’m gonna get some of your nail polish for Christmas ahhh
Lmao
Nails are nails
Okay holosexuals  I was off the Internet for a while so I don’t know if Christine mentioned what she was allergic to that made her eyes puff up. Can someone tell meeeee?
"I don't speak Spanish" My brazilian portuguese speaking ass: 👁️👄👁️
You do nailart? Jk love u queen!
Aliexpress is literally the worst with this kind of stuff. They don’t care AT ALL about stealing content
Trade mark your next creation so you can get your money from them or have it seized
My name is shania lol
Who else loves this look on her! I think she looks great natural! ( the straight hair may not be natural but its a natural look )
I keep panicking when shes holding the hammer because I’m afraid that will hit her nail and break it anyone else?
PLEASE CALL IS NAIL ANOLOGICALS
i live in brazil and the term "gringa" isn't offensive in any way. it basically means "foreign"; anyone who's not from here.
Dude! Your number 5 on the trending page!!
This video made me realise how much odd stuff shes done
Do u love long hair🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
GUILTY!!!!!
No one saying this so I am CHRISTINE'S HAIR LOOKS SO GOOD STRAIGHT
+simplynailogical  *Baited breath for an +EmilyDBaker vid* (Pinterest LLC (San Francisco, CA, USA) and ByteDance Technologies Ltd. (Beijing, CHN), among others, could be named as Relief Defendants) *on **_Rotenberg et al._** v....*
Sick us on them!  We'll hack them out of business!
Your hair looks so nice in this video.
Why not put your watermark in the middle of the screen the the translucent typess
That was on Portuguese Cristine 😂💕 also gringo or gringa is kind of mean. It’s a way to call Americans.
Man, girls cry about nails way to much. Jesus
Ben at the end like “why do you have a rubber mallet w a holo taco sticker on it?” Lol
YouTube , Facebook , Instagram etc owns the rights to anything posted on their platform so they probably sold your pics for profit 🤷‍♂️.
If there was no covid she could have made a video going to some of the salons that use her pics and then to do that manicure. It would be extremity funny if she then brought the peely bag to compare the manicure with the OG Just saying,  ik it's not gonna happen :'(
Cristine: I have binders, binders... Me a trans guy: me too
Bernadette Banner has a really good video where she buys a knockoff of one of her historical dress projects (that used her pictures/ screenshots from her original project videos) and goes in on it. She speaks specifically about the ethics, the quality, and the fast fashion industry, and I think it'd be a really good companion-watch to this video! Also, Bernadette is a fellow "absurdly long haired" queen (though hers is usually in an updo). Here's the link for y'all who are interested! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J80J4oaGVnY
Where you get that tea cup / coffee cup?
Depends on where you're from lol I used to live in southern Texas and Gringo/a was kind of a derogatory term 🤷🏾‍♀️
My mum did this. We got a dinosaur puppet for cosplay use and facebook ads with the company's videos popped up so my mum started to report them and call them out for being fake. Even told the shop owner about it. It really helps a lot as now them adds are taken down
y'all americans ever seen asians barber shops? or every fucking ad by *huge* games or just apps  i've seen lexi rivera EVERYWHERE LMAO

Your hair looks amazing today
Lol in the google translation snippet it actually shows "Portuguese - Detected"
Love the fact she noticed Shania Twain’s music. That part made my night!
Everyone freaking out that she can't tell the difference between Spanish and Portuguese when _she doesn't speak either language._ Like you people could tell the difference between Dutch and German, or Cantonese and Mandarin, or Urdu and Pashto. -_-
Ok not that you’ve ever looked bad bc you’ve always been a stunner but you look AMAZING in this video idk what you’ve been doing in 2020 to radiate these kinds of vibes but keep it up you are literally a peak human specimen
Did anyone realize her hair is done??
How do I get Holo Taco stickers (like you have on your gavel)? I try to save the ones on the Holo Taco boxes, but it always wrecks them. Sell them on Holo Taco please!
You are one of my favorites gringas jajaja <3
It’s funny how I saw her first before years ago on an Instagram ad
i like how this is number 5 on trending. we love that cristine
Is anyone gonna talk about how good her hair looks in this video.
Ahhhh!!!!! Cristine wore her hair down!
"Gringa" means female Unitedstatian. We call Unitedstatians that way because we're sick of hearing them refering to themselves as "Americans" as if they were the only ones in the entire continent. So technically, you're not a Gringa.
I saw a HOLO TACO ad on another vid today! I was like WOW! Finally an ad I LIKE!
When you said "Hey, Simply" it woke up Siri on my phone!! 😱
NOT THE BINDER OF AFFIDAVITS 💀 the shaaaaadeee 😭😭😭
Is gringa mean XD
FOr the nail salon posters, it could be that they just searched up nail powder nails and clicked on your photo not knowing it was yours. Idk if that makes sense, for instance I search up dog photos and i choose a random photo but it’s obviously someone’s photo of their dog that’s on the internet. And it could be a famous dog but I don’t know it’s a famous dog so I use it for whatever I’m doing. IDK if that’s the circumstance though, but I see how it can be easily be taken out of proportion.
cristine’s skin is glowing in this vid✨
DMCA copyright claims can handle this quickly.
EMINEM DISS https://youtu.be/Ocr76wsKlgo
"I can't read SPANISH" lakefg I love you Cristine, you're the only one I can forgive for that mistake 😂 Also I'll always be amazed by the natural ability of us hispanics and brazilians to understand our languages without really studying 😂😂
It’s Portuguese not Spanish 😂🙈
as a Chilean i need to say that “gringa/o” isnt mean, its just a way to say “white person”. Of course some people use it in mean sentences, but the word isnt mean itself
I’m subbed can I be in the jury
Iba a estar muy sorprendida si Argentina no aparecía en este vídeo 😂😂😂😂
I don't mean to be "that comment" but when the clips of previous videos came my brain was just like, " Back when Cristine did nail art" And then I was like no she asked for that joke to die. Btw  I love your content, its super entertaining and I hope Holo Taco is doing well in these times. Ily
simply said “a gavel??? no no no we are taking a sledge hammer against these beaches”
No 5 on trending?!?! Our fam is bigger than beliebers???!?!?!   (For context Monster is trending at no 7)
Gringa Is the female version of Gringo, which is basically a form to call someone who's American, in Latinoamérica we call them that bc america is the whole continent and also is a little despective form to call Americans. Also in Mexico its a type of Taco made with flour tortillas and trompo/pastor (pork)
i feel like i should follow every single person who @ christine saying her shit was stolen, they seem like awesome people
Why does she look so tan? I couldn't not focus on it lol anybody else agree??
CRISTINE HOW TO COOK THAT MADE HOLO CHOCOLATE REAL EDIBLE HOLO GIRL
Why she looks like a 16 year old girl in the thumbnail
Her hair looks soo good in this video
smash there balls with that hammer
Your eyes look so much better!
Ik she will never see this but I want to see how she makes her intros.
Wait... is that...  SIMPLY WITH HER HAIR DOWN?!
Christine looks 27 to me and she never aged
She looks so much like Jen in this video
This video for sea food lovers  https://youtu.be/GoFeNmuT_7w Watch this if you like 🤭🤭🤭🤗🤗🤗
Well, to Cristine's credit, Spanish and Portuguese are basically siblings. I don't blame her for getting them mixed up.
Ben's nails showing up killed me
Omg I’ve seen the mirror nails on Facebook and immediately recognized the paintbrush bottle angle & nails
Damn they’re really calling my girl Cristine a gringa 😭😭
Eae gringas kkkk 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
I'm an Arab and I can translate this article.😁  Is the latest in manicure technology It is a printer that draws you any picture you have on the phone on your nails in a period of 35 seconds ....... Exclusively and only in Algeria.
Hey I wanna be part of the court court not the jury😐😝
congrats on trending ig
God bless to the 1% who see this comment 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Oh wait but I can’t turn it green oops grey it already is
I just wanna say... THAT  WAS NOT SPANISH... GOD🤦🏻‍♀️😂
Is this betch using a rubber mallet?!?! I’m dead 😂
Ah damn I’m late but I’m bored at midnight so thank you
The Arabic one is like : “the latest nail art technology .It’s the printer that prints any picture you have on your nails in a 35 seconds timespan .For a limited time only in Algeria”   Me and every Arab watching : 👁👄👁
New camera who dis??? ❤️
;-; found this on my trending page ;-;
7:34 it says"this is the most modern technology of nail care , it's a printer that draws on your nails any picture from your phone , in just 35 seconds" and then the rest is just info on how to get it lol
Face and finger tattoo your watermark. The only solution.
Aaaaa that's not Spanish. It's Portuguese hahahahah
If these companies are outside of the US, how could you go after them?
Me hearing Christine say are you satisfied me thinking the hamilton song satisfied
Make them pay you for the pictures..
Well, at least you know you're famous now. All the big stars have that happen to them.
I love you hair here. 😅😍😍😍
What was beyns reaction
Do watermarks over the entire up close nails
If, on eBay or Amazon, you type in something along the lines of “cartoon african woman shower curtain” you will be able to find my artwork stolen by Chinese companies and turned into shitty quality items uwu it’s the one with the black girl in a patterned dress with an Afro and her eyes closed blowing a bubblegum bubble.
6:18 Brazilians who knows this is actually portuguese: 👁👄👁  Ohhh and gringa it’s a term for foreigners, a lot of times refering to American people
If simply sued she would get like 30 million dollars
Ya she’s back
Why do you look so much like Jen in this video??
Not spanish... thats brasilian portuguese...
You’d think websites/ social media that accept people to place ads would have to legally check that the person placing the ad owns the right to all imagery and sound used
Gringa is a white girl
I assume they stole your thumbnails from YouTube images when they looked up those terms, which makes it less weird
Is it just me or dis she not put her watermark on like half the video?
Been waiting for this video content foreveeeeeeeeeer!
I laughed SOOOOO much this video ! love how funny you are
Hahahahha that is not spanish that is, I guess, Portuguese
10:42 Dude that first salon is in Florida......I went there...one chick effed my NAILS!!!!!  13121 City Center Blvd suite 104, Jacksonville, FL 32218  Do not go unless you want your toes to bleed like mine did. She had to use some cotton balls and some unidentifiable liquid to stop the bleeding after she cut way too deep...multiple times. Then she took my nails off and drilled so deep that I could see the blood under my nails... just don’t my Florida girls....just don’t...
no ones talking about how shes using a rubber mallet as a gavel???
1:50 the filter rlly made me laugh
Cristine this is why your skin broke out lmao (I know it’s not) love you!!
damn EXPOSED!!!!!!
I wish you were able to sue all of them lol
Before Holo Taco was released: Simpilynailogical’s starter not changing for years After Holo Taco was released: Simpliynailogicals’s starter changing every single video 😂
This is when Cristine will find out how many Brazilian followers she have
Cristine you look so beautiful
The second one is in PORTUGUESE from Brazil! And grengo isn't bad, it's just to referred to someone outside Latin America
Yes, it said “hottest trends among white girls” basically lol
I don't know if someone said it before but Gringa and Gringo are words to call people born in the States. It started as a derogatory term but in a lot of Spanish speaking countries or most of Latin America it became a simple way to refer to someone from the united states
Isn't it sad that youtube ACTUAL content creators gets easily fucked up whenever they use even just a second of a copyrighted song or videos, and they lose all the money they should receive for the effort of making the content....yet these shameless companies straight up steal, lie and don't give a fuck and still get away with it
Gringa means: white female in Spanish. And gringo means: white male. I hope that makes sense.
Who 😳😳https://youtu.be/R4bQeQVqVMI
Oh...my...God...  I'm a little embarassed Brazil is in there...  It's not Spanish, we actually speak Portuguese...  Here's what the ad said:  "The new 'fever' (yes, hot trend!) among the "gringas" (foreign women) now in Brazil" "The lengthning in polygel can be done at home" "And promises big and resistant nails for up to 20 days" "Guarantee your kit with free shipping" "And get a UV light nail dryer as a gift"
Cristine with her hair down? Beautiful
I got my pic stolen by a scamer two weeks ago i want to say anyways one of my fallowers on insta showed me asking if it was me i said no and they were trying to scame people out of moneu i got on there butts and they got there acount taken off instagram because they were makeing people i knew think it was me when it wasnt
I got the notification for this while I was at clinicals and now I can finally watch it🤣🤣
Fo!!ow me Please i post fun stuff lolololol
This is horrible I'm so sorry Cristine sending love ♥️♥️♥️
I actually have seen someone using your nails to sell a product and I called them out on it. All they did was remove my comment. It was on FB and I reported it to FB and nothing was done about it.... SMH
Why the hell does Cristine keep saying "y'all?"
I like toes.....do you?have feet vids? I'd might sub....hard already
All the thumbs down are employees of companies stealing photos!
They literally stole from a crime analyst. Are they okay???
i’ve been using my stupidly overpriced earbuds for so long that i forgot what other types of earbuds looked like until i saw yours omg i- capitalism got me
Gringa means white girl. It’s usually disparaging, but in that context, I’d say it’s not.
Not spanish.... portuguese dear And I call them out saying they need a holo permit for using your face...
and remember you can most likely tell from the yellow nail
I still love how they kept the question mark when they printed out “DIP POWDER NAILS?” in every single one 😂
That's not Spanish! It's Brazilian Portuguese!  Basically the add says that this is the new fever between the foreigners and the acrilic gel nail extensions can be applied at home. It's a merch for DIY acrilic nails, but I haven't seen it here in Brazil, so I guess it wasn't a very popular product or add.
put a watermark on the hand or finger ur not painting
I'm Hispanic, I don't speak Spanish very well but I knew that was Portuguese LOL It says something about it being the latest trend in America with women. Stretching in polygel can be done at home, and promises large and resistant nails for up to 20 days
Hey simply!! I love the new metal polishes!!! They are gorgeous!!!
Gringa is basically like saying a basic white girl
i love you
\ / ●  ● \ / Dont worry, Patrick will beat up them thieves!!!!
Anyone notice that her cup matches her outfit 👀
I haven’t seen any companies stealing ur pictures but I have had a lot of holo taco sponsored ads on insta and I enjoy them a lot!
Show up to a nail salon with one of your pictures and make conversation about it and see what they say lol
11:24 IM TAKIN THIS HORSE BY THE REINS MAKIN REDCOATS REDDER WITH BLOODSTAINS-
suits needs to use this as a mock trial topic ...
Simply, love the hammer, but i had minor anxiety watching you wield that
What’s really sad is the product they are”selling” is actually a scam aimed at young uneducated children with money .
It was #7 on trending. I refreshed the page and it moved up to #5 on trending!  WooHoo! 🎉🎉
Good artist copy, great artist steal.
From a Mexican viewer: yes, “gringo” it’s kind of a mean way to refer to english speakers, non latino people
Love her and that hammer was a big support for the video
Nothing compares to Holo Taco!!! 💖💖💖💖
Can we talk about how she looks flawless without makeup #perfection
Simply not taking no s#!t!!  Luv it! Lol.
If you don't have a copyright on something that you supposedly created and came up with you did it in the lab like it literally came from something you actually created not something you bought from a foreign country and sold as your own you should have copyright infringement
probably what is in the video is portuguese lol but we (in mexico at least, I don't know about other countries) use "gringa" or "gringo" to refer to people from the united states and also the dish that is like a taco is called like that.
I seen that on the Instagram shop tab someone was selling Holo Taco nail polishes
There's a company called holotaco stealing your designs reeee
The only ones that make sense where there ones advertising the type of stuff they sole. Like the dip powered an chrome. Cause truth be told if I was needing nail images of just Google some shit an use the pics that work best. Like I get using your images as sample images. But the ones that are doing it for like an actual product are more messed up .
I haven't heard Shania Twain since I was 7 (13 years ago)
So if they're Bad Company's why did you record them in the first place seems like Karma
I’m really glad this is on trending tho
Your hair looks so cute in this video!
First world problems. Do you think about the children or underpaid workers making these products? Your first response might be to ban these companies for basically paying slave wages. However, for a lot of people in poor countries these are the best or only jobs they can get. Sorry I don't feel bad for you. The whole God damn world sucks. I would rather someone can feed their family then worry about your vanity and greed.
بهدلتونا مع الأجناس
Here is a nail license>>>📄
Girllll, we don't speak spanish in Brazil.....
Gringo white guy, gringa white girl. Not necessarily offensive Latinos like to give everyone a nickname, so if someone close to you calls you a gringa they may just be using it as a descriptive nickname.
DRAG THEIR WIGSSS!
Cristineeeee! You are a gringa, because you are not Latina hahahaha And the text of that post is in Portuguese, not Spanish lol
You should make a whole series of this and call it simplycourtlogical
You really nailed this. The thieves lack the same polish your videos have. Man, a cure... for the virus would be great about now. Not trying to point any.. fingers... but stealing your... clips... Is just not cuticle.. Gotta hand it to them...  And you... I want some tacos now
I haven't watched your videos in almost three years but hearing your intro song again is making me teary ily
HER HAIR IS DOWN WTF
Hi Cristine. I have a really good video idea for you , what if u go to the salon that used your thumbnails as posters and ask them the same nails
You know that I can’t really use your voice in a court of law right? They can’t steal for you evidence or play video evidence.
When is she releasing the holo taco gavel of justice 😀
OMG SHE HAS HER HAIR DOWN😹😹!!!  it looks so good tho 💗
Ummmm #5 on trending I THINK YEAHHHHH
Gringa means..white girl..basically
I understand the frustration in the comments about Cristine not distinguishing Spanish from Portuguese... But came on, we are not exactly going around knowing the difference between other foreign languages, like African dialects for example... We are all ignorant about something 🤷🏻‍♀️
Gringa means white girl lol..
Cristine's hair is so beautiful 💕😍 Definitely hair goals
SIMPLY LAWYER/MARKETING/DETECTIVE GURU
JUST FOR ANYONE THATS WONDERING ABOUT THE PORTUGUESE AD TRANSLATION:  "a nova febre entre as gringas agora no Brasil" means "The new trend among foreigners is now available in Brazil"   (gringa isn't a mean word lol in spanish it means necessairly american/white people but in portuguese we use it to refer to any foreigner)  "o alongamento em poligel pode ser feito em casa e promete unhas grandes e resistentes por até 20 dias" (this is just nail stuff) it means that "the poligel technology to make ur nails longer can be made at home and promises long and resistant nails for up to 20 days"   "garanta o seu kit com frete grátis e ganhe de brinde uma cabine de secagem uv" means "come get ur kit with free shipping and win a free uv drying thingy/light/whatever idk"  Yea i know no one cares abt the last two but i wanted to make this complete lol  Christine brazilians love u that might be why they put ur face in it, cause ur a reference to nail enthusiasts anywhere lmao
6:18 BRAZIL SPEAKS PORTUGUESE 🥺😔
Did you straighten your hair today, or am I just not used to seeing it down? Whatever it is, your hair looks fabulous today....super shiny and sleek❤️
how did i not realize the watermarks were gone until she pointed it out
6:28 ITS PORTUGUESE WE SPEAK PORTUGUESE NOT SPANISH
i love you so much and i did NOT enjoy my name being used in this plagiarism. I do not condone (P.S. you said it right and no one ever does
In the Facebook posts, all the pages had the same video description. Talk about blatant laziness.
Simply:  I can't read Spanish. Portuguese speaking people: Oh nooo. Oh honey, no. Nooooooooooooooo.
https://youtu.be/pASs_nt-QQg
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE TURN IT UP
Mano sabia q tinha br vendo simply hauahauha pfv se manifestem
YouTube unsubbed me????
I can’t take my eyes off of that blue nail colorrrrrr absolutely lovely
I sent you an e-mail a while ago asking if I could use some of your content in one of my lessons. I got no reply, and so I DIDN'T USE IT!
I NEED MORE VIDEOS LIKE THIS
Ben’s picture in the background😂😂😂 LOL THE AUDACITY
OK dude that is not Spanish, that is Portuguese, Learn your languages bruh
OMGGGG CHRISTINE TRYING TO SPEAK PORTUGUESE MY HEART IS MELTING!!!!  BRAZIL LOVES YOU CHRISTINE!!!!!!!!!  (yea imma just ignore the fact that shes trying bc of an awful company cause she sounds cute)
I'm 8 mins in and there's been 3 ads so far, so I guess you've made the money back from all the stolen images 💸😂
The way I got a Holo Taco ad on this video..
I always just assume things are fake when I see that ads use influencers when it's not on the influencers socials.
The real scandal here is that Shaniya Twain has definitely disappeared from the face of the planet.  Seriously. Does anyone know where she is? Is she ok?
when i went to get my nails done i showed them a pic of your nails that they had on the wall. i said the design was cool. He laughed and said he created the design... i just stared at him
I’m Simply *Shook*
Omg I just got an ad for overnight oats. They stealing that tooo!
This video screams Libra.
That ain’t Spanish that’s Portuguese
I can't read spanish.  Me who talks Spanish   That is Portuguese  😂
Damn I was hoping you’d comment on their posts calling them out lol also gringa ain’t mean......but it also ain’t the nicest soooo 🤷🏻‍♀️
Hii cristine, I’m from Argentina and we use the word “gringo” just to describe anyone who speaks english buuut sometimes it can be an insult, it depends of the context, love your vids 🥰🥰
Just to be clear that isn't spanish
Poor Ben. Not only her but also bens face and nails. No one is safe.☹️
You could probably donate your hair and have Ben do it so you could monetise it; I just grow my hair out for a year ((pixieish cut to long; donated 8 inches to a US charity)) but you could cut off around 25-30 cm and probably not be put out by much. Love your videos :^)
That’s Portuguese
You can report people’s posts for stolen content on Instagram just an fyi
this would actually be a rlly good topic/subtopic for ur podcast !!
Simply Lawlogical.
I'd watch simply court airing right after judge judy as a cool down, it's great
Christine should go to one of the salons that used a one of her thumbnails and rate how well they did business wise
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates⭕️
Gringo means white person
I keep getting distracted by Cristine's beautiful hair. I'm so jealous!! I keep thinking that there seems to be something different about her in this video, but I guess its just the long, beautiful, luscious hair... *sigh*
How does Ben feel about his nails getting stolen? He’s a celebrity now. Officially
If anyone's wondering the Arabic roughly translates to "The latest in manicure technology, a printer that prints pictures from your phone in 35 seconds, only in Algeria...for more info go to our page." I'm somehow more confused than before.
Spanish 😅😂😂😂 my God! It's Portuguese! 🙈
7:35 Arabic add. It basically says: The latest nail polish technology! A printer that prints out any photo in your phone for your nails in 35 seconds! Exclusive in Algeria!  I feel so disgusted by the amount of theft online
OMG ARGENTINA?? HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?  Igual la verdad que no me sorprende. 🤭
Jeffree Star has his star mirror, Cristine has her rubber hammer 😂
Ai fiquei chocada com a propaganda em português xD lakskskskskskkssk
Cristine those headphones are a disgrace 🤣
Kinda like wish 😅😅
Currently 6th on trending!! Good job
Who is fr ganna buy 7 nail polishes for 91 dollars like wtf
I have seen your nails on so many bloody Facebook ads, I always comment that they stole the content
Simply looks beautiful!! And the camera quality looks amazing!! Where have I been?
I’m always surprised that Ben seems to not know what video ur filming! He always walks in so confused
can we talk about how pretty so is without make up!!!
Why cristen kinda look like Jen in this video!!!  Her hair looks so good 😊
why did i think this was an old video
At 7:30 is says in Arabic The latest technology for manicure, which is a printer that draws any picture you have on the phone on your nails in a period of 35 seconds Exclusively and only in Algeria
It’s Portuguese not Spanish, but it’s ok jaja and gringo is not an offensive word 😅
https://crowdmade.com/collections/simplynailogical  Are you going to make holiday merch this year, though? :D
OMG CRISTINE! you look SO GOOD with short(er) hair. I cant believe that you put that 0.5 seconds clip of it!
I have a friend who got an EPIC sleeve tattoo in my hometown in south east London and friends have seen his photos in tattoo salons in south east Asia. 😆
Cristine makes a video about how she did not give consent....(⊙⊙)(☉_☉)(⊙⊙)
*Bonk* Go to Holo jail
Okay but like I wanna see a video of her buying those products
Hey yesterday we , (holosexuals) mentioned you as our fav CANADIAN YouTuber on AMANDA'S twitch stream ,🤣🤣🤣🤣, we luv ya
Unfortunately companies takes photos from anyone and everyone and use them for false advertising. I’ve even heard once you upload photos to certain sites they own your photos and can do whatever they want with them. True or not it’s still disrespectful and wrong.
I got the new LG stylo 6 phone and the back is HOLO
12:57 when your brain fart is copyright worthy coinage.
I also  saw Ben's  nails !
“How to cook that” made *real* Holographic chocolate ! Could you please check it out and maybe try making it?!??
The dislikes are from the companies that stole ur photos
completely agree with not buying their stuff, but I'm very curious of the actual product for the nail oil pen 😂
is holo taco selling mallets now 👀
Well, Her thumbnails are more perfect than any ad... The one on youtube I mean ... The ones on her hands are great too
Shameeeee!
Omg, that's not spanish, that's portuguese from Brazil hahahaha Gringo in Brazil means foreign person
6:18 that was not Spanish 🙂. Idk either 😅 lol I just know it’s not Spanish
*companies using cristine video and nail picture as profitable source* Cristine: HAH I'll make profit from your companies bi🤬tch
You should call use your “peelies”
Best birthday (for me) video I've got to see! ^_^
7:44 :*me in the process of making tea* “waittttt!!”
Owo im sorry that brazilians are doind that and just to you know no one actually uses that here
The one in the Instagram page with the nail printer is not just using your face without permission, it's also a scam saying that our country created this machine that prints on nails in 38 seconds and no other country has it, ironically using a face of a Canadian youtuber using a machine from wherever that is 😂😂😂 Also they have a link that sends you somewhere but I ain't checking what that is but they're claiming it directs you to the product to buy it.
damn that sucks. You'd hav to tattoo your watermark on your hand... sigh.
Ironic that she didn’t use a watermark for this video 😂😂😂
You look so pretty with your hair down 😍😍
Hii  Hi
How did Ben feel about his nails & face being stolen? 🤔
You look so pretty in this 🥺
In Mexico gringo means "someone from the united states"  so nah, its not mean
omg i was born to hear simply trying to speak brazilian portuguese thinking that is spanish  xoxo from Brazil 😼✨
I would actually  pay for a blown up photo of your nails though for my salon or just life........
0:36 can we talk about how snatched shes looking with the multi chrome look
.
Gringa is mean but not that bad. It’s usually used for PEOPLE that go to Spanish speaking countries and usually spend their trip saying “ay ay ay ay” in a “Spanish” accent.
Haha you have 7.69 subscribers
me right now: she about to spill the holo
She looks like Jen on the thumbnail
Holo
Every time she slaps that gavel I fear for her main hand nails 🥺
I knew Argentina was going to pop up in this video hahaha
Very helpful to know that tagging influencers/calling these brands out makes a difference!
Gj
It specifically said that 'gringas' is not related to race. Why would she immediately assume 'white girls' ???
I just received 2 of your Holo Taco polishes and. THEY ARE THE BEST, PRETTIEST POLISHES I OWN 💙💚
#7 trending
Wow without any disrespect to you I have to say. You are so beautiful you mesmerize and took my breath away all in one moment.
Is it just me or does Christine look absolutely GORGEOUS in this video! Don’t get me wrong she’s beautiful in all her videos but she looks great today!
I like the Holo Taco sticker on the mallet
7:31 the post written in Arabic, It is an Algerian account and basically it said the latest technological invention in the world of nail art. The nail polish printer which can paint your nails in only 35 second. Exclusive in Algeria
I thought you were gonna call the companies. 😂 not a bad video idea tho >.>
Cristine this is Brazilian Portuguese.They are basically saying this product is a "fever" abroad and now it is availble in Brazil. Just lies. The second option is correct, gringa is about a foreign woman. They are saying foreign woman "love" the product 😂
I like how all the salons that stole the dip powder picture kept the question mark.  “DIP POWDER NAILS?” Maybe we do them, maybe we don’t... that’s the ~*~mystery~*~
"I can't read Spanish" ........................
Cristine, are you not aging or something?
They must have mass produced these posters and then these shops unwittingly by them to advertise their products
Kinda weird to think about the fact of all YouTubers having managers.  Sort of.
You're so inspirational ❤
simply, are you selling those hammer? because i would buy it and smash those salons that stole your photos.
*Bangs Gavel* ELECTRIC CHAIR~
Simplyspillogical today
Yup it does that mean that lol
💜💖💗💗💗
Not even 3 minutes in and I've gotten 4 unskippable ads 😑
#5 TRENDING YES CRISTINEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I thought she was going to accidentally hit something with that hammer
The subtle shade at US press sec is why I love you (among other reasons).
I do a LOT of photoshop and have a pretty basic education on how to use it and... God, I am *cringing* at the photoshop jobs on these ads. Why liquefy the watermark when you have the perfect solid background for using the clone stamp? smh
Omg Cristines eczema is going better!!  BYE MISS ECZEMA SEE U NEVER AGAIN BEECH 🤠🤠🤠
Thank you for calling them out! Side note: I use your DIY nail oil with jojoba and vit. E and I hooked all three of my roommates. 😊
Been kinda on a depressive slump and haven’t watched any YouTube videos in months. Glad this is the one I came back to.
nOOO BRUH THEY CALLED YOU A GRINGA THAS AN INSULT BROO
only the OGs can rembir the piliey bag
omg once applebees stole my dads flickr photo lol
I had a friend who had a similar issue, and if you live in Quebec, there are some very strict laws about your "right to your image". It was much easier to sue on those grounds than on plain ol' copyright
En México vi foto de tus uñas en un negocio que vende productos para uñas, no le pude tomar foto :(
Cristine looks so beautiful in this video tho
Please go to the nail salons lol itll be a series.
Number 6 on trending 💿👄💿🥳
I just unsubscribed to just subscribe to see if it went red to gray
I do feel that maybe the some of the physical salons may not be aware the images are stolen. They probably paid a printing company for the poster that they had in a catalogue of nail art advertising, thinking that it was legitimate.
I have nothing to do with this channel or nails and I'm not a female but let's make this video go viral 😅!!! Like if u agree !!!
She looks like 2014 Simply Nail logical. Wow😲
in holo we trust
I bet that some of the pictures being used in actual salons are images that come up when searching in google images. Not saying it’s right or wrong but I think that’s a more genuine mistake.
What you could do for your watermark just a suggestion and i know it would be a pain in the butt... but maybe put it right dab in the middle where they will crop out the product or ur own nails and well it would be funny for them to try to edit it out 🤣🤣🤣🤣
SUE THEM ALL. 👁👄👁🔪
YOUR HAIR IS GORGEOUS IN THIS!!!! Like DHFDYHVFDHIVFUVDJ
They probably don't even have a product to sell, so they dupe consumers and then make another page once they get reported.
Omg when she thought they were talking about tortillas 🤣
Cristine you are absolutely GLOWING in this video!
girl that is not spanish
You look pretty ❤️❤️❤️❤️
7:30 حتى العرب سووها بعد🗿💔
Your new camera looks SO good
https://www.etsy.com/shop/ConspiracyNails?ref=simple-shop-header-name&listing_id=827871463. I'm am almost 100% sure these are your actual nail polishes with a new label. Idk maybe I'm wrong but idk. I thought maybe the top was different but I think it's the angle of the photo
K
Am I the Only one that thinks that she Cristian is starting to look like Jen??
Bruh you laughing?
cristine, you look so pretty, bruh do some tips on how to glow up before Christmas ahhh because it’s summer in Australia!
I love Ben at the end 😂
Are we going  to talk about  how shiny her hair is?
HAH this got on trending so I hope those disgusting brands see this and learn their lessons
achando muito divertido ler os comentários das brasileiras kkkkkkkkk ❤️
Lol 😂😂😂 when I saw Ben's pic
Wait try to buy their products and confront them like try the oil thing and see if it works idk
dodgy companies: steal cristine's work to make money cristine: use their theft to get views  big brain moves
Yo number 6 on trending check 😳 congrats Cristine!
You should do a video on buying their products and comparing them !!
I had some of my work stolen to advertise products. I don’t even make money on what I make so it’s extra gross since they’re making money on my creation.
When she had to look up what "gringa" meant I laughed out loud so hard lol!!!
Bitch!!! That's portuguese xD
Exhibit c is not an ad of anything, its just talking about the 3d nail art printer thingy that you made a video about. It's like an article about that, talking about it as a new technology. That's all :)
6:02 , that ad is not in spanish... propably portuguese, but DEFINITELY not spanish
Is... is that a holo taco branded mallet? I ... is it going to be sold through holo taco?
Is it just me or does Cristines skin and hair look so good
It’s not Spanish it’s portugués
Girl you should see how much you've been out on wish
WOAH 5 ON TRENDING 😏🤝
Take me to the *HOLO COUURT*
Highlights would look nice on you. You obviously look beautiful with your natural hair color too though 😊
Gringa is generally white girl.
I’m not sure if us subscribers have a name... but can we be the peelies?
The ad from exhibit b is in portuguese, and although i speak in spanish we use gringo/gringa in the same way. It basically refers to people that talk in english, mostly from usa; it isn't necessary offensive, but it depends on the context (in this case I don't think it's meant to be offensive)
Btw...that was Portuguese
Simply, you’re glowing and look so healthy!
lol
PLEASE if you know an ad is featuring stolen products or images, let people in the comments know where to get the actual product. I saw a really cool tarot deck on facebook and the comments were flooded with people saying it was stolen images and that the creator instead was a small etsy shop. It saved me from getting a subpar product and actually supporting a small business.
Congratulations on #7 on trending 😄😄
Identity. Nail identity. Naildetity....nailtity WAIT-
Ugh people are so wrong for this you deserve more views and money than those companies !!
my mom came to my room and asked what I was watching  (i had this video up) i said "a court case" lol
Translation: THE NEW FEVER AMONG THE GROUPS NOW IN BRAZIL POLYGEL STRETCHING CAN BE DONE AT HOME AND PROMISES LARGE AND RESISTANT NAILS UP TO 20 DAYS
This is a full video of Simply momlogical
The lack of effort these companies and pages used to remove your watermark is amusing. The way they did it is easy, but is so blatantly obvious that it's stolen🤣
is it just me or does cristine look more like jen rather than herself in this video?
Simply SUElogical
They use cristine to make money, and cristine just pull uno reverse and make money from the video about em. 🤣🤣🤣
Gringra/gringo=White girl/white boy 😂
her hair is down this must be serious
"nova febre entre as gringas" hsjsjsks
you're way too tan for fall in canada lmao
that was not spanish hahahahahaha that's portuguese, and no, gringa/gringo it's not a bad word (at least not where I live)
I once  commented on IG ads with stolen cristine's content, and they blocked me 🤣
Ben brought the tea for all of us today.
I'm actually really surprised there weren't any straight up HOLO violations in this one.
I never trust these ads
Helen Keller isn't real
That’s Portuguese, not Spanish 😬
In that specific case, “gringa” wasn’t used in a bad way. They meant to say “the new fever abroad” but in a reliable way (= if the gringas are using and recommending a product, that means it’s a good one)
bruh whenever she said amaya I looked at the screen so fast 😂
Should sue them anyway.
THAT WAS BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE, CRISTINE! 🤣
Did I pause the video to make myself a cup of tea before getting into it? Hell yea I did 😉😉
I see them on Facebook constantly, people are so scummy
6:17 IT'S NOT SPANISH IT'S PORTUGUESE Cristineee
Okay but sis looks so good
this was long overdue
6:44 * panics in latin american *  GUYS THEY KNOW NOW, THIS IS NOT A DRILL, THEY FUCKING KNOW
Is not spanish is portuguese 😂😂🥰🥰
me: i wonder why cristine didnt make her snapchat name something like "nailogical" with an s in front. like an abbreviation. s. nailogical. snailogical. me: oh..... oh my god...... s n a i l o g i c a l...... 🐌
One of the most ridiculous examples I’ve seen of this sort of thing is when a hair care company used a screenshot from one of Good Mythical Morning’s videos where Rhett gave himself a peanut butter wig. These companies are shameless.
Cristine’s skin and hair looks so extra nice this vid! Like something is deferent but not really? I remember she had some allergy problem a while ago and I relate bad so I’m so happy she looks her best normal ever!
The confusing portuguese / spanish thing, I get, but not knowing gringas??????? I thought that was general knowledge lol. Also, gringo/a is specifically for north americans (not just english speaking) and also, not exclusively for white people. It’s not exactly mean but it’s not specifically nice either (?)
John 3.16- For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6.23- For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 -That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen.
Idky but I can't stand trimming your cuticles, like that *cannot* be ok
I smell something... and nope it isn’t *Holo Taco* nail polish... it’s a LAWSUIT
i think simply would only let Davids tea take pictures on her nails
Stolen
Cristine your hair looks so pretty!
This is reminding me of that week simply was sick and got like $3000 suing people for copyright and gave us a whole copyright education on snapchat
What dishonest jerks!
Gringo/a is not meant to be offensive in my part of Mexico. It refers to people from the US. It makes sense because “estadounidense” is so long and “americano” is not a thing — we’re all American in America.
That sucks but I’m so glad you made this into a joking video. Just think of all these people using you as a compliment because you are so amazingly talented and these scumbag companies will never be able to accomplish what you have done 🙃
I'm all for being petty and stickering your face with your name, just watermark directly on your nail! We the fans support the petty energy!!
7th on trending nice!!!
Nobody can agree that crime is crime....
Most nail salons buy their bigger prints and art from a greater supplier so I’m assuming there is a bigger distributed that’s made posters of your thumbnails and is wholesaling it to salons !
Cristine with the hammer and my batwing sleeve mind: "I hope you sha-mash the like and subscribe button!"..... Alrite~
Yes it does mean that and depending on the tone and person it can be bad (gringa)
The full face multi-Chrome gives my troom troom vibes
You should watch Bernadette banner and her video on a fast fashion a dress of hers that she made by hand straight up stolen for $49.99 and how she reacts to it
Can you be my lawyer?
Hi! "A nova febre entre as gringas" is actually Brazilian Portuguese. About the word "gringa", I saw comments saying that in latin american Spanish speaking countries, it is sometimes used in a mean way to say something like "white girl", but I also saw comments saying that in these countries it is used to refer to English speakers. In Brazil, where the text is from, I saw some people saying the same, that it is used to refer to americans or English speakers. Where I live, in the south of Brazil, when older people use this word, they usually refer to europeans (remember that Brazil is a giant country, so a word can be used in different ways depending on the place). Among younger people or on the internet, I usually see it being used to refer to foreigners in general, everybody that is not Brazilian. I think it can be used in a mean way, but as a native Portuguese speaker, considering the context, I don't think that's the case. So, I would simply translate it to foreigner, not in a bad way, and the whole setence can be like "the new trend among the foreigners". If a Brazilian eventually call you "gringo", don't worry, the person probably just means foreigner, not in an offensive way. Sorry if I got anything wrong, I tried to summarize the comments I saw about it, feel free to correct me or ad anything. By the way, so cool to see how many meanings the same word can have. Also, nice to see how many latin american holosexuals there are!
tbh the thumbnail on the salon was probably someone not knowing using pictures off Google Images is still illegal/immoral
Ironically Youtube is suggesting your DIY Dip Powder Nails video on my feed
Feet rub things 🤔
*Brazil Portuguese exists* English native speakers: I CAN'T READ SPANISH! LOL
Christine and Ben are becoming hotter and hotter each year, wow 🤣❤️
U saw you have e a add go Qween
in Brazil we speak portuguese. "Gringa" is a slang for a foreign female (gringo for males)
jajaja she just called white girls gringas😂 im sorry no hate it was just funny cause its almost the opposite
simply so pretty
I was waiting for this video lol
Goddamn. Would kill for that long straight hair
Christine I live of you and avatar the last airbender
I've been waiting for this since I found you last year hehe
Hope everyone is having a good day it would mean a lot of u can subscribe thx
Huahauahahauahua Quando as pessoas falando que aqui no Brasil falamos espanhol.

I can’t believe I’ve been watching for over 3 years.
Gringa is slang for white girl
welcome to the internet, WTF
Cristine’s skin and hair looks very pretty in this video. (They look lovely every other day too) ❤️
spanish 👍🏼
Do you age Backwards????
can we just appreciate how much better her skin looks like i’m jelious👁👄👁
Cristine really looks great with no makeup on; she's beautiful either way. off-topic, I know. lol
Simply that was Portuguese  not Spanish i think lol
@6:20 That not Spanish looks like portugués
I know itll never happen, but like stop for a sec and picture cristine with a long bob
BRAZIL, I'M DEVASTATED!!!! It is not spanish, Cristine, it is portuguese
6:17 that's not spanish!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     😂😅 it's portuguese..
We (US and Canadian governments) need to start using sanctions against countries that refuse to go after people in their respective countries who abuse copyright laws.  People shrug their shoulders and say nothing can be done, but it CAN--contact your elected reps AND start being very careful about where you buy products from.  If in doubt, don't place an internet order!  Leave negative reviews on these companies whenever and where ever you can.  Consumers and creators are being abused.
The ad from the polygel its from a brazilian store!!!!! its portuguese not spanish LOL (btw i am brazilian and i feel EMBARRASSED)
6:16 actually that is portuguese 😉
OMG YOURE NUMBER 5 ON TRENDING ILY SIMPLY
Of course the gringa thinks it is Spanish... 😂
Omg someone stole your nails that must hurt and how are you gona paint them
cristine looks SO pretty in this video omg looking good while roasting people what a queen
i wonder if theres a company that sells nail photos to salons because its crazy how many salons decided to use that specific photo
do i report them tho
Holo, Simply. So, a little bit of info (hope you don’t find this offensive). In the ad were the “gringa” stuff happen, “gringa” is a term LatinAmerican people use to describe Americans (people from United States). Why? I don’t know. And also, in the Urban Dictionary says that “that is no longer true in Costa Rica”. I was born and raised in Costa Rica and we do use the term gringos to refer to Americans. Either if he or she is in the other country or in their country, it doesn’t matter. And the video were it said gringas, I’m pretty sure is Portuguese, but at least it isn’t Spanish. ☺️☺️
Is it me or she dyed her hair,its hot tho
I like how Cristine made up a pun but she didn't realise it and bring upset of it Meanwhile I'm just die laughing "misce-NAIL-leous
Jesus Christ saves from sin. Romans 3: 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Hebrews 9: 27  And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Isaiah 64: 6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. Revelation 21: 8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. Romans 5: 8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 3: 16  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 14: 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. Romans 10: 9-10.  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Jesus said John 5: 24  Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. 1John 5: 10-13 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. Ephesians 2: 8-9  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Romans 8: 1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 1 Corinthians 15: 3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 2 Corinthians 5: 21 For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. .....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
wait a dam minute THAT (6:39 minutes) is not spanish
Were any of these the products you reviewed in the original videos?  Because they may have thought it was fair to quote your published review as a "look how much the famous beauty queens like us".
The ad basically said the new trend among white girls lol
That was not spanish Simply, it was portuguese :(
Cristine, your hair looks soo good in this video 💜
Nah I'd be so annoyed
They gonna use it hair soon for hair salon 🤦‍♀️ OH WHATS NEXT ur sweat pants maybe 🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️
White girl is the more accurate translate of gringa haha
.
thank you for listing your original videos in the description!!
A random comment: while in many Latin American countries "gringo" would be a pejorative way to refer to people from NA/EU, the ad from Brazil, and in Brazil it has a much broader sense, being basically just a slang for foreigner most of the times (and sometimes could refer even to a foreigner from another Latin American country). Also, as much as it can be pejorative in certain contexts, it often is not (including in the ad).
U need to do a vid going into a nail salon who use ur pics and see what happens 🤣 xxx
Uh, so I know that you’ve tested standard makeup before and ruled out this as your reason for your skin suddenly deciding to puff up but could it at all be related to the multi-chrome powder that you put on your hands and face a couple years back? I forgot this happened and I don’t know how dangerous that stuff really is in that much volume. Did it get in your pores and cause harm to your skin long term? 😬
The ad that says "Uma nova febre entre as gringas" is actually in brazilian portuguese (i guess gringo/gringa is originaly spanish lingo, but we also say it in Brasil). It does mean a new trend between gringas, but as the dictionary says, gringa is no race related, mostly because our understandmant of race matters are way different than the situation in north america. Anyways... Gringa can be used in a mean way, but people use it normally just to designate people countries like usa, canada, england, australia and etc. I guess it's essencialy kinda mean but hey, u guys mix up our langueges all the time, so i think we have the right to call you gringos :P
No one: Me: **vibeing to the marimba in background**
"I can't read spanish" Nooo Cristine! Is portuguese in the video it even reads "Brasil" at some point.
"I can't read spanish"  Girl, that was portuguese lol  Don't worry though, sending love from Brazil 🇧🇷💕💕
Ugh.  Those posters in the nail salons...is someone selling those to them as marketing materials?  Weird they chose the same thumbnail 🧐
I LOVE the hammer
it’s not spanish it’s actually portuguese
Why r u so tan
My friend told me that the word gringo is how they use to call the united state soldier. It basically means green(their uniform) and go. That was there way to say that they wanted them to leave. So the word gringo is used to call foreigners and it's not really a positif word.
It's disgusting that there are so many fast fashion/nails companies out there, and so many well-known celebrities/clothing designers etc, that it can be almost impossible to know if any advertisement is at all real.  Two things you can do to make sure: 1. Check the reviews on independent websites, including places that tell you if it's a dodgy website, like TrustPilot/Web of Trust. Yes, reviews can be bought, but you can still usually get some coherent and genuine reviews out there. Especially on sites where it's not just a star rating system, but comments etc.  2. If a picture looks dodgy, do a reverse image search on Google. That should help show if it's another knock-off, or possibly even the original source of the stolen content.  Unfortunately that doesn't seem to work on instagram (I was trying to see if I could reverse image search one of Simply's instagram pics to see where it had been stolen to) or mobile phone a lot of the time, but at least try to have a look and a google before buying something from an ad. But it will show you dodgy places like Shein and Romwe.
Today I got Holo Taco adds on other YouTube videos and phone game apps for the first time. Made me think our little Holo Taco is all grown up *sheds a tear
"Are you hammering something down here?"  J U S T I C E
Report them to the site, don’t be shy 🙃
Can we all just take a minute to look at how old those headphones are 6:00
I won't shop at places who do this. That is so horrible. Luv ya.
What nail polish is on your hand?  Is that a Holo Taco hammer? And I JUST GOT MY FIRST HOLO NAIL POLISH ( not Holo Taco becuase you do NOT SHIP TO SOUTH AUSTRALIA!!!)
"I can't speak spanish" video: **is in portuguese**
ok but where'd you get or how'd you make that gavel
cristine, that's portugese
Omg did you do something to your hair??
Okay agreed like you shouldn’t support them..but like that would’ve been SO entertaining 😂
Also, that ad literally translated Portuguese to English with Google Translate: The New Fever Among the Gringo Now in Brazil  Polygonal stretching can be done at home And Promises Big, Sturdy Nails for Up to 20 Days Guarantee Your kit with Free Shipping and Get a free UV drying booth  And translated in Nailogical English (see what I did there....I'll see my self out): The new fever among the ladies, now in Brazil, Long nails can be done at home and promises big, sturdy nails for up to 20 days. Guarantee your kit with free shipping and get a free UV drying lamp.
No, gringa isn't mean, it just means foreign lol
"I've got binders! Binders of..."  TFW you're old enough and American enough for "Binders of" to be triggering.  I turned into PTSD dog with "binders full of women" on repeat in my head.  Crazy to think of just how much worse politics has gotten in 8 years.
another good reason to call this crap out in the comments is that more casual viewers might think that yes, Cristine totally endorses shady dot shop 2 on instagram, and buy their shit because they want to support Cristine.
Is it just me? Or she looked like jen in the thumbnail lol
Holo Taco sledgehammer coming soon? 😜
Currently going to school for intellectual and cultural property law. Hank Green has a great video on how we’ve destroyed copyright law, highly recommend ✌️
Lol they just dont stole ur cats
This reminded me of the time youtuber Charles Trippy's picture was used as an advertisement inside of one of the claw machine games.
"They stole Shania Twain's music!" Wow they're just stealing from all the Canadians
new hottest trend among white  girls me dead on the floor Hahahaha
Cristineeee in Brasil people speak portuguese, not Spanish. This is coming from a portuguese holosexual 😭 😂❤️
Hell yeah Cristine! Nail 'em to the wall!
I think the salon marketing is sold to the salons from a marketing company.
The down thumbs are from people who have stolen Simply's YouTube identity
portuguese: *exists* gringos: SpAnIsH
Minute 6:19, Dear Cristine that is not Spanish, it’s Portuguese.
Seriously, I'll never understand people who steal. With the quality of cameras these days, it's not hard at all to take decent shots and arrange them tastefully. Sigh.  The level of disappointment I feel is staggering.
I laughed so hard at that poster. I just remembered random barber shops in my place has zayn malik's haircut all over😭😂
Cris the add that used your face wasn't in spanish but actually in portuguese, brazilian portuguese. I'm from here and I'm sending much love for you!! Byee
Ok but did anyone else get a mid-roll ad for Holo Taco? Because I did 😂😂😂
"Pictures of my feet to sell their feet scrubs" I don't think that's why people would steal pictures of your feet, Cristine....
You should email each offender and ask for them to sponsor you lol
My mind went a whole nother direction when you talked about pictures of your feet and "foot rub stuff" .  Also your hair and face is super pretty today and that jacket is a really good color on you.
oh gurl you really gonna receive a lot of angry comments about that "I can't read spanish" LOL    (it is actually in portuguese for those who don't know)
So when are holo stickers coming out
Simply really spilled the tea on these companies today.   The horror! The poor tea! 😩🍵
Them earrings 👀👀👀 must know more
Guilty verdict, I suggest the death penalty
The best part is the rubber mallet she’s using has a gavel.
If I ever see a nail salon with Cristine's nails I'm not going in there EVER
“I can’t read Spanish” and the advertisement was in Portuguese lol
hahahaha fuck yeah
Should’ve taken this to H3’s content court
oh no, not again confusing portuguese with spanish D:
OOOOHHHHH. That first one! I saw that floating around recently and was like why does this feel familiar....? (Missing watermark)
When there was literally a picture of Ben on the desk I wheezed. The AUDACITY.
That's not spanish haha that's portuguese
7:31 it says "latest achievements of manicure technology! It is a printer that paints any picture you have on your phone onto your nails within 35 seconds... click on the photo and it will give you the official page for this printer(and a word I dont understand lol)"
ooo she could do a video where she buys the products of the companies who stole her videos/clips
I love your hair
That's portuguese tho. :) It's from Brazil, and it calls you a gringa, which is an american. xD But yeah, Spanish is close.
I can’t believe they just put her face onto an ad and said “una gringa” and Cristine was like 0_0 what does that mean? Yes Cristine they called you a white woman
It really sucks when this happens. I've had a person steal my image before and they got really annoyed at me when I called them out on it. At least they eventually took it down but only after I publically called them out for it!
@simply Can you remake the multi chrome nails using your new polish?
Your skin and hair look so vibrant and healthy! I hope you're on your way to recovery <3
It portuguese not spanish
Hi Cristine. i'm a native arabic speaker and i can decipher what's at 7:32 ... Basically they're trying to sell the machine that can print on nails... They're describing it as a new technology and soon to be exclusively brought to Algeria so yeah haha i guess they ripped off your image because you tested it (hope this helped, love your videos)
I dont know if this apllies to other latinamerican countries, but in mexico the word "gringo" allegedley comes from the time when Mexico was at war with the U.S, and it was used as a way of identifying U.S milittia cause they were wearing green uniforms and mexican soldiers would say " green go home" which then got shortened to "gringo"
Good for you for not financially supporting these companies!
There needs to be a hashtag called simplystolen for people to showcase simplynailogical content that’s stolen
That is not spanish
You should make a holo gavel
This has the same energy as asian barbershop using zayn's picture in front of their stores 😂 if u know what i'm talking about u know which picture it is
I know this doesn’t have anything to do with the subject of the video but... every time she hit her table with the mallet I- hajdhshsg   Is the table oK?
These products are most likely related to counterfeit manufacturers which is really dangerous for the consumer. There have been many articles about unsafe and inhuman work environments with those manufactures as well as toxicity in the products themselves such as fecal matter and other harmful chemicals.  Definitely do not buy. If they don't care about copyright law they probably don't care about the sanitation of their products and working conditions of employees.
I think the Pinterest mirror chrome ad is one I sent because I distinctly remember DMing her on Instagram about it
That's not spanish ........
no hate, but how much must one be inside their own head to comment people taking and abusing their uploaded content? FYI, you did sign off any rights the second you've uploaded your content to the internet.  people cannot stop images of their children's faces and bodies from being exploited, now you want to complain over your nails being used? are you serious? you made the deal with the devil, earned a couple million and now what.. not fair anymore? grow up, cristine. retire or shut up.
It wasn’t Spanish. It is in Portuguese the add
Did you get your hair straightened? Looks so pretty!
"i cant read spanish" EXCUSE ME MAM
The 222 people who disliked this video were the people who stole Cristine's pictures.
No court judge costume? Wowww (Jk jk jk this was hilarious)
It is confusing spanish with portuguese for me✨
"I can't read Spanish" oh honey... that's not Spanish
In Brazil, "gringo" (and "gringa") is not pejorative, it's simply a foreign person, especially one who speaks English. Still disrespectful for stealing your content, but not mean :)
Yup, gringa means white girl like very basically (and it's usually if not always used as an insult) lol
Facebook will monitor people’s speech with fact checkers, yet they get paid to allow these advertisers  to rip of their users,. as well as allow these advertisers to use material stolen from creators.  It’s ridiculous.
6:18 that ain’t Spanishhh hahahaha GRINGAAAAAAAA ME MUEROOOOOOOO
oi, just wanted to say how fuckin good you look without makeup on. hope, that eye-infection-thingy is getting better  :)
6:19 kkkkkkkkk eu to morrendo, mais ainda assim vc tá mais certa do que eles
I'm so happy to see so many brazilian holosexuals in the comments! <3 I'm not the only one stanning this queen, I feel hugged :)
It was portuguese there hahahahaha
YOU LOOK AMAZING
I HEARBY SENTENCE THESE COMPANIES TO DEATH
"i can´t read spanish" omg cristine why did you kill me it´s written BRASIL 😭😭😭 we speak PORTUGUESE
I love that you're so Canadian that no one ever called you gringa
As you should 💅🏻
It's not spanish, it's portuguese hahahahaha
Let the blood and the fake holo spill
Why does Cristine suddenly look so much like Jen in this video
😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤Love youuu
As a mexican subscriber, to watch the gringa thing was HILARIOUS 🤣🤣🤣🤣
0:34 kkkkkk só quem é br entende ...
Looks like we're going to be getting HoloTaco stickers.....:)
I want that nail oil pen :D
i'm thinking about this 'fandom' name... simplyhoelos, no? okayy...
I’m getting scattered holo taco for Christmas!!!
Cristine which nail polish of yours should I buy? For Christmas I am 10 lol and growing my nails. I have watched your videos since 2018
Likes before watching
I thought everyone knew what gringo meant
Holo christinee
Steal your hair because it's beautiful.
Its port of geese Cristine 😡😡😡
Well holo there
Girl you're simply glowing😳💅
Love the video! But I wanted to say that I have now seen two Holo Taco ads  on YouTube and it makes me so excited! Im so happy that things are going really well for your brand!!!
Yes I am Mexican, my family always asks me if I am a gringa(American) or Spanish/Mexicana. Since I was born here🤣
Gringa is not necessarily bad, is just an expression to say that someone is not from our country basically
I just want to know why all of a sudden you are blurring out your wall of polishes?
gringa means like basic white girl or like a girl who is white but its typically not a nice thing to say and my parents say not to say it. So yeah idk
I don't speak Spanish, so someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you nailed it. I think they're saying that it's the latest trend among basic white girls. 🤣🤣🤣  (I don't speak Spanish, but I do know what the term "gringo" or "gringa" means.)
IDENTITY THEFT IS NOT A JOKE JIM, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE SUFFER EVERY YEAR
An explanation, not an excuse: is it possible that these business owners just typed "dip powder nails" into Google images and Simply's thumbnail showed up? It's weird that they all used the thumbnail specifically.....
The Ravenclaw nail look in this video though!
Looooll.  Cristine. that was not Spanish,  that was Portuguese.  Brazilian people will get mad at you.   ehehe
Cristine saying Gringa made me die💀its definitely slang for white girl😂
Yeah, get em girl!
6:18 ela falou que a gente fala espanhol.
As she should 🖐👁👄👁🤚
Spider nail gel
Hey simply that arabic post in 7:37 was talking about that nailpolish designe printer
Theirs a company , in my home town who turned my  tumbler page in to a brand is using my idnety and everything, I feel like I should contact cat fish about this and put this person in to jail. It's really wired and creepy how brand companies do this. Not only, I had a bunch of people call me about this happing to me as well.
Corporations: Its not a problem anymore Cristine: Yes yes its a big problem people
Tea time with Cristine! I got my organic Dandelion Chai Tea with me and ready to enjoy the simply!
AliExpress and Wish are a masters in copying, so
Can I just say thank you so much for not calling them 'Chinese companies' or like, finding specifically chinese stolen stuff. Cos that's a reoccuring trend I see a lot with these 'callout' videos, is calling things 'cheap chinese knockoffs'. I understand that a lot of them ARE from China but to label them all as Chinese has always felt off to me. And obviously they're not all from China
6:20 "I can't spanish" please my brazilian ass cried when you said it.
Your hair looks amazing 😍
Can you not even go after the ones using Holo Taco? That's awful.
Cristine: I can’t read Spanish Me, Mexican and Spanish speaker reading the advertisement: me neither, I think I forgot my first language JAJAJAJAJA
I died when I saw they used Ben's nails footage.
"I can't read spanish" Ow, that was Portuguese I think xD go get them!
"i cant read spanish" u mean portuguese 💀💀
Gringa basically means white woman , gringo means white man usually they only speak English and they’re not Latin or Hispanic
So "gringa" or "gringo" ( feminine and masculine form ) in Brazil means a person that is from another country, so anyone that not from Brazil. Seen the ad they are not trying to offend you, they are just saying that thing was trending between foreigners. As a brazilian I am sorry for that, unfortunately this happens a lot and is very very wrong, a hope that those companies could stop doing that because they are using the image of other people illegally.
I love Cristine buttttt in Brasil we speak Portuguese, not Spanish! That was Portuguese!!!!
Loving your new camera 🎥😆
6:19 that's not spanish, that's portuguese.... :P
That's brazilian portuguese btw...
Me: "oh cool a brazilian ad" :)) Cristine: "I cant read spanish" Me: >:(((  By the way cristine if youre reading this: "gringo" is just slang for people outside latin america, it doesnt have a bad connotation <3
Not them calling her a gringa 😭 lmao
Anything that is posted through social media sites like tik tok, pintrest, and instangram. you can contact the app companies and report the account and provide information to have those posts at least removed, or possibly have the accounts deleted
Youtubers realize how many brazillian/portuguese subscribers they have when they confuse portuguese with spanish...
Wow just wow
Get em
Gringa/o = white female/male ;)
I was dying when she tried to discover what is gringa 😂😂😂😂 Brazilians like bellow 🇧🇷 👇
If you made posters, and sold them I would put it up in the salon!
Holo mom! I missed you 💗
Hahaha yes mama you are a gringa Is not bad
Wait so is she ever actually gonna take legal action against them or is that even possible?
Can u not put your water mark on your insta pics and YouTube videos
Stealing is wrong- but it means you are more FAMOUS then you thought!
Cristine: I have no idea what they are saying, I don’t read Spanish. Me, fluent in Spanish: Honey that is most definitely not Spanish UFFFF
" I can't read Spanish" It's Brazilian portuguese 😄 Meaning: It's a new trend among white girls now in Brazil, order now!
Damn she really out here famously talented to the point millions of scammers are stealing her work. That’s a whole new level
Simply court. That's all you had to say
When will you ship to spain? :-(
I SAW A HOLO TACO ADD ON YOUTUBE!! so cool
can we take a moment to appreciate how pretty she looks 😉😌👌
lessons I learned: - add watermarks to content - call people out online
No wait it doesn’t turn green it turns grey. Ew why 😂😂😂
As I watch the video, I felt this strange feeling that something was wrong.    And then I realized Cristine had her hair down. Nice.
the arabian post said: the last of what nail technology has reached which is a printer that draws any picture in your phone on your nails in 35 seconds only in algeria
Girl you look beautiful!
🤣 My dear that was not Spanish... 🤣 🤣 I have an employee and she said that is Portuguese... 🤣 🤣 🤣 My dear I wish there was something that could be done is just not fair...
nikkitutorials and cristine calling out people stealing their content? i stan two queens
TRY THE BORN PRETTY THERMAL GEL POLISHHHHHHHH
Wheres the simply watermark gone? This is weird i havent watched in a while
So as far as the actual salons having the same poster of your picture over and over, I think it is possible that a supply store selling advertisement posters with your work. So it would be the poster makers stealing rather than the actual salon itself. I could be wrong but that would explain why  so many got the same picture. And as a professional cosmetologist I have seen advertisement products like that in supply stores before.
That one in Arabic, I forgot which timestamp,  basically says that they have a printer that prints any imagine from your phone onto your nails in less than 35s only in Algeria
6:21  “I’m sorry I can’t read Spanish” Hahaha that’s Portuguese
Gringa it’s not mean hahaha it’s just means you’re a foreigner
Omg your face too Christine wow the balls of those companies 😡
I can't believe there is nothing you can do about the overseas companies... that's such a flaw in the system >:( I denounce capitalism
Did she cut her hair?!?!
I MISSED YOU
you look really pretty today :) x
In  7:34 The translation of the boast that used your face from the nail printer video:  the first creation machine for printing on the nail the nail printer finally in and some Arabic country name and they put the link of the printer account down below that  what’s the post saying
Gringa is another word for white girl gringo is white person
:0
"turn that red button green..no it turns grey ew why"😂😂
Gotta love that holo hammer
I saw an advertisement for your merch on Pinterest, but it pulled up your shop so..
So when are you going to sell the nail oil pen on holo taco
yes lol gringa(o) is referring to a white person 😂
Omg this is real people are stupid do they think they will get away with that
I confirm that "gringa" or "gringo" means a native US American
Where did you get your coffee cup and I know there is tea in it lol
Next time actually call the companies and tell them they stole your content
I hope she realizes that when the video says "A nova febre entre as gringas" it also says Brasil underneath it. We speak portuguese. Not spanish.   And BTW, gringa is used for a female that is clearly a foreigner. It can be a compliment or offensive depending on the context.
As a brazilian holosexual I'm confident to say: Dude, not spanish  And "gringa" is not necessarily bad, but it can be HAHAHAHA
I have a feeling your thumbnail(s) might be in google image search. Sometimes non-internet-y type people will just google image search and assume the images are free use because you can find them for free.
“Gringa/gringo” is a slang to talk about native English speakers lol
Would be cool if you’d go to these salons where they have your pictures on the wall and see their reaction😂😂
that was portuguese, but yeah, it makes no sense!
Reality vs expectation in the real life Mirror nail polish tiktok POV: wow look at how easily it applies! It’s just like a mirror! Cristine: It doesn’t look like nail polish... it doesn’t apply like nail polish... look at the shit... WTF?!
I love the addition of a denouncement of the companies in the disclaimer in the description. Such a thorough Cristine 😆
You should buy, and try out the products  from the people stealing your identity.
Wait so if someone poblically shames you and bullies you like hard, and they don't live in your country, you can't do anything????
The salon with the thumbnail kept the question mark for the dip powder lmao. Like "do we have dip powder? Do we know how to do it?"
Your hair looks different 👌🏼
BAIIN and cHristeene, are like so cute
Guuuuurl that it's not spanish 😑 Ni siquiera se parece un idioma al otro....  I'll cry 😭
To everyone commenting on how Cristine mistook the Portuguese for Spanish: 1. She doesn't speak either lanuage. 2. There was only a few words of text and both languages fall into the SAME BRANCH of language (West Iberian) so it's easy to mistake them. 3. She googled the word "Gringas" and Google TOLD HER IT WAS *SPANISH*  I know the intention from most of you is not to make her feel bad, but I can guarantee she does. Just let it go...
Hey Cristine and simplyfam!   Gringo/gringa = Foreign  It's not mean just a popular way to say it. I'm not a fan of the word too tbh
I had no idea how big Cristine's brazilian fanbase was until she mistook portuguese for spanish. That's something brazilians don't forgive 😂😂😂  But we love you anyway, Cris ❤  (Dá like aí pra ela ver 😘)
so when is holotaco gonna sell nail oil pens
That was not Spanish...
Ok, but how you look so good today?????
Oof get exposted my dudes.
Can you do once again nail tutorial in french with Ben or Matt
As a person who speaks some Portuguese, "gringos" usually is slang for white people. Stop stealing others people footage and photos companies :((
I'm sorry, Cristine, but it was funny to watch you trying to understand the word gringas lol. That video was in Brazilian Portuguese and the sentence means "The new trend among foreign girls". Like, gringo can be demeaning as in "white privileged foreign person who doesn't understand our reality" basically, usually directed at Americans, but it also just means foreign person in general. In this case they were implying the trend is cool because Brazilians always think that new technology becomes available in the US and other countries before it arrives here. Basically, we glorify imported products from certain countries, thinking they're better than what we have.
It’s not Spanish it is PORTUGUESE 😅😅😅😅
Idk why but she kinda looks good in this video...
Oh my gosh. Did that chrome make up have any of the metals you're allergic to in it?
This is portuguese not spanish lol
omg chill lmao, why are 90% of these comments like “OMG Cristine that’s not Spanish it’s Portuguese, don’t do us like that” like cmon y’all can’t expect her to be bilingual & just expect her to know everything. Like damn
Shes using a MALLOT, not a GAVEL
I love your Holo Hammer! I also just noticed that SimplyPodLogical is now labeled as the second channel which I find hilarious because by my count it is #4
LOVE the purple chroma nails😍
With the thumbnails: I think people just search on google and print things off. So if  I google "dip powder" your thumbnail is probably the top result
I thought that was Jen in the thumbnail 😂
WTF!?  These People Are SO BLANTENTENTLY Stealing Simply's Stuff! Simply Squad - STAY ALERT!
Honestly you should buy the products just to make fun of them and publicly shame them even more XD
can we get simply socks  & hoodies, tshirt
Oh also " gringa" is just the female form of "foreigner" and its not pejorative so dont worry
Brasil.... I'm from Brasil... we speak PORTUGUESE (Not Portuguese from Portugal) NOT SPANISH!!!!!!
I think many youtube thumbnails easily come up in google image search, you see that there isn't a timestamp on the bottom right (this can ofc be photosopped away, but it's automatically not there when you google image search). there's probably some much-used combination of words that makes that one nail dipping-thumbnail easy to find or something.
cAn we get simply socks
Omg the ad from 6:25 says "the new fever of the whites"
Did u get a new camera?
Cristine: If yall need a tea break.   *remembers I have tea in the kitchen.*  *goes gets tea*
7:25 you got it right simply smartlogical. It does say the new trend with white girls.
Ok sorry i now that is not the point but that is not spanish( at +- 6:20), thats portuguese Also, hope people stop using your stuff to promote theirs without permition!!! Why so shamelesssss
no spanish oh my i’m crying now bye
Why does she look like a horse girl with her hair down haha
Omfg lafayette,la is my hometowm im dead😂💀now i wanna know the nailshop
LMAOOOO gringa....
Gringa(o) is just a way for us mexicans/hispanic/latins to ig call a white female or male for example like "oh that gringa is pretty" "that "white girl" is pretty"
can get get a thermal holo taco next?? :D
you’re looking so much better! i hope all is well with your health now honey xxx
I would love to see you use the products they are advertising with your material! I think it would be hilarious lol
That was Portuguese, not Spanish. And yes, “gringa” basically means “white girl”
I was wondering what was different about Christine today and then I noticed how nice her hair and side part looks💜💜💜 YOU LOOK AMAZING AUNTIE CHRISTINE!!!
Is nobody gonna talk about how nice cristine looks in this video she just looks so pretty 🤩
6:40 hey Cristine, that's brazillian portuguese and it means like "a new fever between the foreigners". Fever actually means that it's kinda like a trend and gringas is just how we refer to foreign people. It's not actually offensive at all
Wow, i never considered “gringa” to be mean but now, thinking about it it is mean. Omg!
i honestly believe that creators like you should find a way to band together and force this all to stop because it is illegal it is wrong and massively scamming people who don't know someone's brand naively buy their crap
One of the things i need to tell my customers, when they get completely over the top furious and psycho at me (I work for a national contact centre which primarily is basically a complaint centre i guess but I also fix lots of stuff and help educate etc), that it is imperative we are told when something goes wrong becuase we cannot fix it or do  anything about it if we don't know. Of course i get the standard "why should i have to tell you x person messed up? They should be doing thier job right..." or "it should just be better" I'm like yea of course ot should be better and every One should be on thier A game 100% of the time... but sometimes people make mistakes and bad things happen.... the person who messed up isn't gonna come back to thier manager and say "i did 26 things wrong today, this is all of them" and then go and fix it all the time... like that is not how any thing works... if you tell me what went wrong i can ensure that corrective action is taken and the problem is fixed. It won't happen in the next 2 minutes... sometimes things need more time to resolve especially if it is super complex... complaints are gold to my company, if we get complaints from hopefully non abusive people,  we can change for the better. Ideally no legit company wants things to go wrong all the time but all kinds of relative feedback is amazing and what is needed to help grow a legit business. I forgot where i was going with this... but also in closing, the shoddy businesses who steal other people's images and videos and stuff are bad people and need to be held accountable for the fraud they are inflicting onto unsuspecting people who are probably going to be expecting some nice fancy expensive nail products and end up with a broken watch or a random scarf in their mail box or be given info about their parcel going to them but it turns out its not even a box its just a random small letter that is actually addressed s elsewhere a few streets away with nobody's name on it and nothing in it
i really wanna see you try poly gel and give your opinion on it, i’ve seen it around a lot and would love to see a video about that
NOT THEM CALLING HER A GRINGA LMFAO
Oof
CRISTINE try to make HOLO chocolate. 100% edible. :)
6:02 they are saying it's a new fever between the foreigners (not Brazilian people), a poligel thing that can be done at home and promise long and resisting nails for about 20 days. Its something like that.
That is not Spanish!  Éso no es español! Es Portugués lol
omfg cristine trying to understand the concept of *gringa* has me deceased
It would be a dream to have simply heart this
That is Brazilian, and is not bad... Because "gringa" means Americans.. So..
Tô tão feliz de ver quantos brasileiros assistem essa GRINGA <3 ae, só pelas milhares de reclamações sobre espanhol/português! Haushuaahuahss
i mean... isn't using a picture, as an illustration, belongs to fair use? i'm not talking about the ads, i'm talking about the pictures in the nail salons over the products on the wall. cos that's not an ad... yeah they could take photos of their creation and use that instead of a yt thumbnail, and yeah they should maybe credit who the pic belongs to, but come on.  apart from that, i absolutely agree with the video.
The same day I try chai tea Cristine posts. what are the odds.
*Who else noticed Cristine's hair immediately!!*
I think the printed out thumbnails just exist because these salons google searched for “dip powder nails” or “x nail art” and the thumbnails showed up. Without knowing they’re thumbnails they might just look like cool graphics to them I guess, I doubt it’s uncommon for salons to steal off google images.
The gringa part had me dying 😭😂😂
she missed the opportunity for simplyLAWgicol :(
The word gringo/a  mostly used as slang for Foreigner or foreign. Companies will sometimes say something is gringo or something is popular among the Gringos as a marketing strategy. For people to think that it's better quality because it's not made locally.
Oh Christine that was portuguese, not spanish ):
https://youtu.be/bOFx4yWQ88E
Sometimes I forget she actually has another job
cristine, you should paint your nails green and use them as a green screen
I was going to make a coment about the portuguese but apparently it was done
About the video at min 6, that's not spanish, please don't be disrespectful
*please do nail art* 👉🏼👈🏼🥺
I love that she's using a rubber mallet for a gavel, resourceful queen lol
"Gringo or gringa" is often used in Latin America to refer to people from the United States... They say Latinos, we say Gringos (I'm Venezuelan)
omfg I lost it when they showed Ben's cuticles LMFAOOOO
All i can think of is how much money she would make if she sued them all...
DRAG THEM
Mds tá cheio de BR aqui 🇧🇷 achei que eu era a única. ^-^
They are for sure buying your product and selling it as their own more then just usuing your name /content
ok but SIMPLY YOUR HAIR LOOKS SO NICE IN THIS VIDEO
yeah cus maybe the picture they used  they search on google images and thought it was not a video of a creator? xD its my thought
Kkkkk "Nova febre entre as gringas" 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Who else wants to buy her nailpolish but is too  broke to buy them
Christine: *shows up a Brazilian ad* Christine: I can't read spanish Me, a brazilian **not** gringa: Hold up
Omg I'm from Algeria and i feel so bad lol 7:28 sorry Cristine :(
I love that she still doesnt put them out where as she shouldve been because theyre gaining money from her content and thats WRONGGGG
Here we use 'gringa' to refer American people (USA people), so it is not the new fever among 'white girls' it is the new fever among american girls (or USA girls) it is a simple form to call USA citizens, it is not mean, not at all
Once I saw it, I figured people would tweet the video to you, but have you seen "holographic chocolate" by How to Cook That? I'd love to see you try it.
helo my name is dongerino pasterino. ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ, i am 69 year old donger from imaqmeatloaf's stream . 420 years ago i was kidnapped and put into a donger concentration camp for 9001 years. 1 year ago, imaqlasagne and imaqpie invaded the camp and rescued me. now i work as teacherino, passing down the wisdom of ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) to young dongers.
Great video glad you could bring some humour and light to this situation love ur channel and ur content
if it is that many salons, I bet it is a supplier, not the salon themselves. Like the acrylic supplier told the intern to get images of their products to print and send out to salons and then that person just grabbed any nail art from google images
Watching her investigate gringa was the funniest shit
Ben at the end has the same energy as my dad coming into my room when I was 14 and dancing weirdly to YouTube videos at 11 pm asking me wtf I’m doing
Cristine, you need to sell those stickers on holotaco.com. even though the are not polish, also make NAIL VINYLS
Did you get any new news about your sore eyes? I think it's banana allergy ..sue Beynn xx
I was literally told by teacher tht u could go to prison for plagiarizing
Sad tht this can just happen like wtf wht happened to copyright rights like wtf
I wish more creators would do this. I know it takes a lot of balls to sit there and call companies out by name but it won't stop until people do and they learn it's a bad practice that will negatively impact their business.  You handled yourself well. I have people steal clips and photos from my exotic animal rescue and have got more donations than we do, the actual rescue caring for the animals, because they present themselves as the real deal. We have also had large vendors at tradeshows use our videos to sell to people claiming it as their own and it honestly breaks my heart seeing thousands of dollars go in their pocket because people genuinely think they are helping our animals by giving to those companies. It's hard struggling with vet bills sometimes knowing some jerk somewhere got money off using their image and it's not even helping the animals who need and deserve it.  It's fraud. It's stealing. It's harmful. It hurts people and their businesses. I'm glad to see larger creators taking a stand. I hope this calling out starts to be a thing across the platforms we use as well.  Best of luck Cristine in getting these issues resolved but I know how that goes and I feel your pain. ❤️
CRISTINE THAT'S NOT EVEN SPANISH IT'S PORTUGESE
THAT IS PORTUGUESE NOT SPANISH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gringa is what we call blondes or white people that clearly speak English  It can be kind of insulting when we use it in some forms Btw I’m a bilingual Mexican
This is when we realise SimplyNailogical did the SMART thing. If you don't make any nail art videos, no one can steal them?
Gringa = Brazilian Portuguese slang hahaha
Why would they use one that said “dip powder nails?” With the question mark...? Like they aren’t sure if they’re nails or not? Too funny
I kinda want a COMPANIES WHO STOLE MY NAILS TO ADVERTISE THEIR PRODUCTS HAUL video now
I’m sad that portuguese language is confused with spanish... i mean 😪
Side note can holo taco sell their logo as stickers the hammer with the holotaco logo looked soo good
"I don't speak Spanish"  me knowing Spanish: 😺 also that word is used as an insult a lot 😭
The Ben picture killed me!!!
Simply, you look beautiful in this video!! i love your hair down! Also, WHO IS DISLIKING THIS VIDEO? Probably the people from the companies LOL
“Not xxx. Just... one x.” 😂😅
Me: gets add of dogs needing rescue  Me: wtf Im Watching a nail video   Me:👁👄👁
Haha I live in Louisiana and my sister lives in Lafayette, MUST FO THERE. No backlash tho. Revenge isn’t always the answer. Just want to check it out.
Gringos/as is just slang for American. So added insult to injury in this situation. 🙈🤣
Latin American here and native Spanish speaker: First, that ad was in Portuguese. Second, gringa or gringo is a slang term used for people living outside of Latin America. It is mainly used for white Americans, but it can be used for pretty much anyone whose mother tongue is not Spanish or Portuguese. It can be derogatory because it is mostly used to make fun of tourists and foreigners.
Cristine with a holo hammer in her intro, iconic
6:20 IT'S PORTUGUEEESEEEEE Common people we are at the 21th century, not everyone in America Latina speaks Spanish..
6:18 Cristine that's Brazilian portuguese..
"Spanish" 🙄😐 Yes, as portuguese, I got a bit offended 😐😅 but I loved the part where you tried to read it out loud xd  I'm from Portugal but I'm 99% sure that in Brasil they say "gringas/gringos" for foreign people. It's not mean. It's not just for white girls, it's for everyone outside of the country. Again, It's pretty much their slang for foreign people.
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS 😍
Damn, Cristine, there is something magical going on with your hair today. You look so good. I won't ask what you did with it because I know the answer 😂
I was laughing so hard at the "gringa" part 😂 pobre gringa
9:18 hearing simply saying my mexican af last name shook me out of my bones
i'm surprised there wasn't a nail joke when ben came in to see if you were hammering something.
*Portuguese on screen* Cristine: I can't read spanish. Btw, yeah, "gringo" is mean.
y ese fue el día en que Crisrine descubrió lo que es una gringa 🤣🙈
I'm glad your hair is not dry as hell today 😂😂
Sue them😌✋🏽  Edit: this pisses me off and I say you should SUE THEM :)
One day you wake up and they stole your fingers
The word "gringa" is not mean, and it is not Spanish(like you already saw on google translate). It is used here in Brazil to say that you are not from here but is usually used to say that you're a North American. Anyway, I don't blame you for not knowing that, since you're not from here. Love you and your channel.
You should start putting your watermark across your fingers above your nails
Fun fact: you didn't noticed that cristine removed the watermark
Who's waiting for a vlogmas with crissy ?😂
you look so gorgeous with your hair down 😍
That wasn’t Spanish
Hey Christine, about the clip at 6:20- I have been studying spanish off and on for like ten years now, I'm pretty certain that's not spanish otherwise I'd definitely translate it for you
Cristine looks better than ever rn
I’m imagining the nail salon ones in a very wholesome way, like older nail artists who run a nail salon finding your pictures and thinking you’re so good they want to put in their salon, not realizing that’s actually not a kind act, but I’m probably attributing too much positivity to them
noooo gringa tratando de entender que es gringa
Hi! Never been here this early!! You are my FAVORITE YouTuber!❤️
Go to a nail salon. Ask for the exact simplynailogical manicure they're using in their advertising. The technican pulls up the video to follow along. I feel incredibly awkward because I never expected to get this far. We both laugh at the same jokes in the video. Our eyes meet across the UV lamp......
If only that red button would turn blue when you pressed it. 😭
not the ‘i can’t read spanish’ when the text is in portuguese 💀💀
Its funny bc I live in colombia and I have actually seen Kristine nails in like 20 shops until now 🤣🤣🤣
is that... one of the new christmas nordic mugs from davids... cristine... how many did you get
LOL.  People are idiots.   I have an employee who decided to make an ad, and I asked him where he got the photo and if it was copyright free and if he had permission to use the drug company logo.  He got mad at me and told me “what is your problem? Of course it is free.  I found it on Google.”  Ya, not how copyright and trademark law works.🤦🏼‍♀️
Christine. Do holo chocolate right now.
I wish that you could buy some of the products that they are selling under the guise of your nails/face! What a waste of money but seriously it would be hilarious.
When all the comments aren't about the fact that other companies use her content without permission but instead they are about how she mistook Portuguese with Spanish. They're two very similar languages (I'm Spanish) so people chill please
OMG Printing out Youtuber thumbnails sounds like such a boomer thing to do Lol. Even if no actual boomer did it just radiates that same energy of not knowing how the internet works.
8:39 I had no idea “I’m Gonna Getcha Good” was a Shania Twain song. I only knew it by the Jonas Brothers and had no idea it was a cover!
180 Dislikes from false advertisers
Can we talk about how the color of her tea mug is the EXACT color of her jacket?
Cris did you straighten your hair? It looks great
Stealing is not cool. But seriously can holo taco make holo chrome polish like that one thumbnail made it look like🤪
Well at least Cristine knows the most important Spanish word: Taco  😂
In exhibit c which is in arabic it says: the latest technological discovery in the world of nail art: a printer that prints whatever picture you have on your phone onto ur nails in 35 seconds exclusively in algeria. Click on the photo to access the official page to find  this printer.
everytime I watch simply she looks younger and younger
Is it just me? Or DOES THAT HAMMER SEEMS SO TEMPTING TO BE PAINTED HOLO ON COMPARED TO HAVING JUST THE HOLO TACO STICKER !?
*grabs a chainsaw*IF YOU WIN OR LOSE CAN I KILL THEM-
Beyns awkward and uncomfortable sounding “alright have fun” was hilarious and made me choke on my avocado and egg toast for breakfast 🤣
Actually it is Portuguese and I can't read it either.
I love how Cristine is like "I used to do nail art, I should go to a salon" But maybe she just needs a nail art saturday or something and just do some nailart which she likes or wants to do!
I've been waiting this for so long
That is such a shitty thing to do tho    Their products are terrible so they use your clips to make it seem great lmao
Cristine: idk what that says because I can’t read Spanish  Me being hispanic: miss gurl- that’s not Spanis- thats Portuguese 😗
😎😎😎get em
you should just send them all threatening cease and desist emails, I mean it works for sony.  Also just go after instagram they are letting it happen you have a better chance of just having the accounts banned.
yeah, gringo/a is slang for white people.  Not always insulting but it definitely can be.
Gringo in Latin America usually just refers to someone from the United States or an English speaking person, but we also use it in a derogatory way to refer to the privilege out of touch Americans
i just got the notification wtf youtube
I am so sorry for this .but you like jen
gringa is a white girl and it’s used as an insult😭😭
You should put clear watermark on the center of your video like mostly fp do
Oh no!!!! Girl. That's not Spanish ... Kinda hurtful ! And "gringa " means foreigner .
Just so you know in costa Rica we do call ppl from the US ( or anyone that speaks English) gringas and can be used as an insult but in that case it wasn't haha and second the beginning of the sentence wasn't even spanish but portuguese 😅😂
I know a lot of people tell youtubers “oh you look so great even when WITHOUT makeup!” but like she seriously looks great right now 10/10
I literally made a Twitter account just to tweet a link to an Amazon page that was using Cristine’s nails for holopowder to her like 4 years ago. Dunno if she ever saw it, but I always assumed she just sighed and moved on when these things happened so I never bothered again. Justice boner to seeing her calling them out FINALLY.
New title name: Companies Cristine Needs to Sue for the Use of Her Nails
Dont cut your hair unless you really want to... my hair is also very very long and I have cut it all off before... I regretted it and grew it again! ✨💅🏽💜🎨
It's Portuguese not Spanish and gringa is a female who speaks English or is from somewhere abroad
I feel like there’s a ‘nail salon supply’ place that’s selling these posters to people somewhere ... that many people could not have had the same stupid idea independently - just too much of a coincidence 🙈
I think your thumbnails are used the most common because all you need to do it type in "multichrome nails" and go to images and the thumbnails for your videos pop up but if you look at some of the advertisements they use other people stuff and stock photos so they probably didn't do it intentionally but with the video clips when they went over the water mark they did it intentionally you know?
Cristine puting title on her video: Calling out companies Who stole my nails Other youtubers puting title on their  video: CALLING OUT COMPANIES WHO STOLE MY NAILS!!!!!😱
Gringa = white girl ... usually in a not great way lol otherwise they call you whetta - pale skin Latin girl lol
I’ve tried learning Portuguese and Spanish and I knew that wasn’t Spanish lol   But yeah wouldn’t it take less time to hire someone for your specific vision of your product rather than looking through a bunch of videos to make it fit your product? My theories are: the product is shit so they couldn’t make enough money to hire people OR they want people who are famous to “vouch” for their product. But it shouldn’t matter because smartphones actually take good enough video/pics and any person willing to model is fine if the product works.
Brazil speaks Portuguese dear beloved Cristine  :0 ahhahaahhahah Love you byyyyeeee
Has Ur allergies stopped flaring up where u look like Sid from ice age? FYI I LoVe YoU
Yes it does translate to "the new hottest trend among white girls"
Wouldn't it be interesting meeting someone that found your channel because of someone stealing your content and not taking off the watermark? 🤣 still, It's not ok
hey christine! it’s not Spanish, it’s Portuguese 🇧🇷💜
Unless you stick the watermark in the middle of your content.. A guy who does this is called "post 10"
Commenting is a good idea and I often do, but the thing is they delete comments that are "negative", let alone copyright infringements. My personal advice: just don't buy from companies that have shady # of comments compared with their followers.
Cristine being protective over her drink slave:  "Get yours here!"  "What are they talking Ben or the nail oil pen??"   "I'LL SUE YOU!" 😂😂
im srprised no company has used your l o n g l u c i o u s hair yet
A Subscribe red button is more appealing to click, the gray one is not. There ya go
How to piss off both spanish speakers and portuguese speakers in one sentence
I'm brazilian and it's not at all ofensive/frustrating that she didn't know that it was portuguese instead spanish, I wouldn't be able to identify mostly foreign idioms also 🤷‍♀️
Wow! Your video quality is great, did you change something?
For items on Facebook and Instagram, can you or us, as your loyal minions, report them as stolen intellectual property? I'm ready to fight for you Cristine!
for the nail salons they probably just googled “dip powder nails” “ombré nails” “nail art” and printed it. i don’t know it’s what i think
I’am guilty i use your nail polish and i’am loving it.👌🏻 sorry
That’s was Portuguese lol! You got the meaning right tho! “The new hot trend (hence “fever”) among foreigners”
What about putting the watermark in the center of the screen then they cant cut it out
The one in 7:33 means (the last thing technology has come to for nail glamour 💅 its a nail printer that prints your photos on your nails! Only in 35 seconds exclusively and only in jazaer. Acrylic on photo )idk lmfao the rest doesnt make sense and my first language is arabic and im arabic theyre basically from al jazaer
Dousent this make you wanna do more nail art for people to steal?😁  You are a truly inspiration!  And if you need a nother proof : 2 almost 3 years ago I started a middle life crisis and REALLY work on myself and it all started, unconsciously, with my nails... and quess who accompany me all the hours doing my nails, almost everyday? Watching peoaple like you exist make me have hope for future, I allways say that are a lot of peoaple and few humans, you two are beautiful humans inside out! I love everything you stand for. I watch your potcast regularly, I hit the like but I never comment. Today is the day. RISTECPA
Gringo is a slang used between latin americans to refer as basically everyone whos in NOT from Latin America, mainly north-americans tbh. But it can be people from England, Egypt, Japan, Spain and etc. If you're not from Latin America than you're a gringo.
Love you Cristine ❤️
What if they did send you a email asking if they can use your stuff but it’s somewhere in your 50,000+ emails so you never saw it and they thought you saw it but forgot to reply so they did it anyway
Call them out- Yes ma’am
You should make holo chocolate from how to cook that
You have a good sense of humor about this LOL😂💓
I can't believe they are selling fake Beyns smh
Haha a local nail salon used your sharpie rainbow nails pictures as an example of their acrylic work. I called them out on their Facebook and they blocked me.
Welcome to nail-court, F***ER, the judge is happy to see you now.
wow she looks so different I haven't watched her in forever 😭😘🤰
We've been seeing this in the knitting community as well. Fast-fashion companies stealing designs and even using the designers' photos to sell... bad copies I guess? It's so frustrating.
Everything you said about Brazil was extremely offensive. Since we speak Spanish until we're not white. By the way, gringa is not offensive
Portuguese: **exists** Simply: i don’t speak spanish
Is it me or does Cristine look tanned? ☺️
You hair looks SOO pretty today!!! 🥰
“i can’t read spanish”  it’s in portuguese   HAHA
when you're so early there's no good comments yet:(
Omg Cristine, that was brazilian portuguese that was not spanish kkkkklkk it says that "mirror nails are a sensation in the international community (that's what gringo is, basically a foreigner)".
For anyone saying the ad was in Portuguese, not Spanish, the languages are very similar and I understand how someone that doesn't know the languages (me for example) can mix them up. Most of you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between Danish and Norwegian, it's all relative to each person
I got permanently banned from reviewing on Amazon for calling one of these shitty thieving companies out.
The "spanish" is actually portuguese, and the term "gringo/a" for us is not ofensive because is just what you are, but the americans think they are snow flackes
Pleaseeeeeee go and get your nails done in those shops!!!!
6:20 CRISTINE THAT IS NOT SPANISH YOURE KILLING ME IT’S PORTUGUESE
"are you hammering something down here" "just companys stealin my stuff" *BANG BANG BANNG* "ok have fun"
The fact that it was not Spanish-
6:18 "I can't read spanish" i think that's portuguese AKDJJS 💀
I love your hair💜💜💇🏼‍♀️
I just saw Costa Rica. Hi There! Ça va Cristine!?  As a Costa Rican I only use the term "Gringa" or "Gringo" to refer people from de U.S.A.  So, I support the disclaimer of the Urban dictionary has!   So for us, is not mean at all ^-^ ♡
Is she using the official simply nailogical gavel!!!!!!😱😱
i just wanna state that gringa is not offensive thats how we call to americas in mexico and is also a dish =)
honestly im sure everyone would be fine with you putting the watermark all over the screen, itd be impossible to crop out and youd still have the clips in the raw state.
Why hasn't Cristine done a overnight oats related nail art?
Omg I extremely love her holo mallet it looks like she’s a judge and all she needs is a robe lol 😂 ps. Not to sound creepy but I have literally been stalking her Snapchat waiting for this video lol😂
Its not Spanish! Its portuguese!!! 🇵🇹🇵🇹
It means white girl
This is how you know she's a Libra: Brings a gavel to a roasting.
This has nothing to do with this video .....but I want to know what you use to make all your loose leaf tea. My tea ball lets to much through it? Please help
completely unrelated but cristine looks so pretty in this video. i love seeing her hair down
fun fact: we say gringo because of the war, the soldiers of the USA wear green, so they will say green, go! so gringo in Spanish pronunciation. Or something along those lines
I can't believe she tried to read in spanish 💕💕  Wait but that's portuguese-
Can you make holo taco mallets a thing I would pay hundreds for one
Oh shit, shade man
6:18 it's not spanish, honey hahaha it's portuguese
Halo Taco should sell a nail oil pen
ooh hohohoo yes i am here for the callout B)))) also Cristine u look really lovely, seems like ur face is doing much better hah. Also, am enthralled with those two nail colours together!
"i can't read spanish", don't worry, it's brazilian portuguese :D hahahaha
Cristine: "I can't read spanish" with a portuguese phrase... *offensive*
I hope your eyes are doing okay, they look much better!
6:06 it's Portuguese for: "The new hot thing from around the world now in Brazil" and "It can be done at home and grants long and resistant nail for 20 days" "Get your kit with free shipping and get for free a UV light  for nail setting"
my gf just broke up with me. simply never fails to make me laugh ily :')
Beautiful Example of profiting off of people who profit off of you! Love it !
It's not Spanish it's Portuguese 😂😂 and gringa is someone that is not from your country 😂
Beautiful Example of profiting off of people who profit off of you! Love it !
Gringa just means white girl really. I'm Hispanic, that's how I know.
Beautiful Example of profiting off of people who profit off of you! Love it !
The Portuguese (not spanish, we get mad as hell about this) basically selling as a gel extension kit for nails. and the "A nova febre na gringa" is just a way to say that the product is trending in another country and it's now finally in Brazil
New Holo Taco merch, rubber mallets coming soon!
WHO STEALS OTHERS WORK?!?!?! THOSE PPL, "YALL NASTY!!!!!" WISH YOU COULD. SUE EM, 🤬🤬🤬🤬!!!!!!! HUGS BEAUTIFUL LOVE THE NEW POLISHES!!!!!! STUNNING!!!! IF ANYONE SEES THEM, REPORT THEM N GET S.S N CALL EM OUT TWITTER N TAG Miss Mama 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
WHO ELSE WANTS BRAD MONDO TO DO HER HAIR‼️‼️
That was Brazilian Portuguese not Spanish 🤣
some peoples children!
Your hair and skin look really healthy 🥰
THANK YOU FOR 14:56. Every time I see a youtuber buying replicas of their designs from businesses that are stealing their content I'm like "then why the frick would you give them money and then ALSO promote (albeit shaming them for stealing your content) their business??"
6:23 it's not Spanish, it's Brazilian Portuguese :))
Cristine you are so beautiful, you workout and lost some weight, you look fantastic. Love you❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It's not Spanish! It's Brazilian Portuguese!
Igycrvrnu
That wasn’t spanish 😊
Gringa or gringo can be mean depending on the context, you can say it jokingly to your friends or you use it when you’re talking crap about white people (I personally haven’t done the latter, but that’s what I’ve seen happen). I know it was portugués but hope that can help.
SHE HAS 7. 69 SUBSCRIBERS 69!!
"I can't read spanish" . . Brazilians: *ARE WE A JOKE TO YOU?*
The fact Cristine said something about the subscribe button turning green is a callback to the old days of YouTube before Google bought the company. Like late 2000s YouTube.
That was portuguese not spanish 😂
Ben sounds so scared
6:18 It´s portuguese, brazilian portuguese to be more exact.... but ok! We love you anyway !
Omg hii I loveee your vids you have helped me so so so much throughout this had time I love love loveeee your vids ❤️
It just occurred to me that some of these people might have been fans at some point unless they literally just went to YouTube and typed in the the product then just used the most viewed videos.  So people are just so scummy  like is your product so shitty you can’t even get good pictures or video of it ? Most likely they just don’t want to pay to make an ad . Complete BS . I’m just surprised I haven’t seen any knock offs of her nail polish sets .
Oh hell yeah
Oh hell yes
"i can't read spanish" oh cristine... as  brazilian i feel attacked
Gringa is a word that we use in latin america for a food, but we also use the word to talk about people who lives un USA or speak english. "Gringa" is use for women and "gringo" is use for men.
Judging by the thousands of comments saying the same thing, I think she now knows it wasn't Spanish. Goodness people.
THAT'S NOT SPANISH, IT'S PORTUGUESE
My heart broke 💔 when you say I don't speak Spanish, but is Portuguese 😔
Christine: I don’t know Spanish  Me, a Spanish speaker: that is not Spanish
Minute 6:20 that video is not in Spanish, since it mentions Brazil my guess would be Portuguese
i think this is the first time i’ve heard cristine ask for us to subscribe
"gringa" is foreign woman for brazilians kkkkk
I watch one channel that does pedicures and she has started to put her copyright logo within millimeters of what she’s working on so that way it makes it very difficult for companies to steal it because They have a hard time removing her trademark or copyright logo because it would take out part of the picture that they’re trying to sell. Kind of like our nail gurus putting their name on the side of a nail in their pictures
There's still white girls in latin countries.. Isn't being white and having white skin the same thing?
i can't read spanish
Hi! The second ad is not actually Spanish, it's Brazilian (Portuguese from brasil). Translation: The new trend in girls, now in Brazil. Polygel lengthening can now be done at home and it guarantees long and lasting nails for 20 days. Get your kit now with a free shipping and win a UV light for free
WHY IS THE HAMMER HOLO TOO
Nailojical:i need to stop banging the hamer *few minits later* Nailojical: *bangs the hamer*
I love SO MUCH the way you handle with this kind of situation! Wish I had this humor! hahah ❤ I have been going through the same kind of thing for years now, Brazil is full of manicure courses that simply DO NOT USE THEIR OWN PHOTOS, it's bizarre! They even post videos here on Youtube about "how to steal other people's photos" and things like that... I try to talk about this problem, and report this type of post, but unfortunately it is spreading more and more... Here in Brazil this is a really BIG problem 😰
6:18 GIRL THATS NOT SPANISH THATS PORTUGUESE LMAOO
Simply Trialogical
I think you shoud make exception for nail salons, and tell their names. I'd like to avoid nail technicians who suck at their job so much, they have to advertise their salons using stolen designs, instead of their own creations...
It isn't Spanish, it is brazilian Portuguese.
Cristine just so you know, people don't really speak spanish in Brazil, but portuguese..
A gringo o gringa is a way people from the US are called in latin america. Is it mean, a little, but we call ourselves worst things "joking". So it could be mean, but not necessarily, maybe depending on the context. But you aren't "gringa" cause you canadian
how does Cristine not know what gringo means lmao...
Wait the fireeeee 🔥 hair tho
Thank you for this. I have a had the same thing happen - I make greeting cards for crafty companies, and I have seen my cards used to sell counterfeit stamps and dies on Facebook selling groups and on AliExpress. Makes me furious, because FB won’t do anything about it. Neither will AliExpress.
Why dose she look like jen today
Okay but can we talk about how her skin looks amazing in this video!
I love how she is struggling to understand the ad because it’s Portuguese and not Spanish 😅 Brazilian fan here 🥰
That's not spanish, it's portuguese, but you did understood the gringa slang ;)
I have only watched the first few seconds but I just wanted to say your skin looks amazing. I know you're kinda sad about not being able to really wear make up, but I just wanted to say, you are beautiful without and I don't think you need it. :)
its not spanish! its portuguese
cristine i hope you didn't hurt your hand hitting it with that mallet
I can't believe she made the golden pun "miscel-nail-eous" BY ACCIDENT
You should buy the products they put on there and see what they send you
Cristine, your hair looks so pretty!!!!
Love your random videos but can you PLEASE do a nail art video!
people in my school call me gringa because I'm the only one who speaks English
My hearth 💔, is portuguese. Dont hurt the brazilians fans like that...
As a Mexican I can explain the “gringa” thing. It started in Mexico’s revolutionary times, I think?? When USA citizens would cross the border, and Mexicans in the northern states would call them “greens”  since dolars are green so they would said “green go” and that transforms in “gringo”. So that’s the way we call USA citizens, it’s not necessary a insult, just a way we call them 🤷🏼‍♀️
The funny thing is if you cross reference half these companies on the sites they come up on they don’t exist at all now.
Market that nail oil pen!  I'd buy.
Uuuum, hey Cristine..... That thing that you couldn’t read wasn’t Spanish..... Spanish is my first language, so I know it wasn’t Spanish     Also, love from Puerto Rico🇵🇷❤️
Cristine: I can't read Spanish Brazilian fans: am I a joke to you?   BTW Cris, gringa is what Brazilian call someone that's not from Brazil
I’m still waiting for you to sell your nail oil ...recipe?… we’ll buy those pens from you. ❤️
gringa means disparagingly to people who speak English.  It is something like called the person as Yankee.
What I don't understand is that these companies aren't showing use of their own products. Surely if you don't feel like they'll sell without stealing someone else's content then you should improve the product or just be honest. In the case that they're receiving the images from another company, i.e. they sell products from other companies, then for their own sake why not at least check if it's stolen content? Stealing will only get them in trouble in the long run.  With that said, I'm sure there are cases were some people aren't aware it counts as stealing. Maybe a few of those salons just googled pictures of the nail products they use and printed what looked the best. Not to say it's okay, but I feel like it's happened once before. Just some thoughts. 🤷
I liked that the plaintiff kept taking tea breaks.
Can you make a drip cake, like one that is edible with a nail polish bottle accessory on top(also can be edible) or make a cake in the shape of a holo taco
SIMPLY COURT WILL CATCH YOU       Better watch out 👀
Also That's Portuguese lol but it is similar to Spanish sometimes
I feel like Cristine still doesn't know, but when she shared her diy nail oil, those brush containers shot up in price and started including 'nail' and 'cuticle' in the title. Now you can even get them pre-filled in a range of colours and scents  She did that. Single-handedly. I sure am glad I bough mine early
In the post that is in the minute 7:30 is in Arabic language  Translation: The latest technology in manicure is a printer that prints any picture you have from your phone on your nails within 35 minutes
Would think if they stole your content, they should at least send it to you for free.
IDENTITY THEFT IS NOT A JOKE
13:42 Favorite part of this video, lol!
I couldn’t stop looking at the holo taco sticker at the begging
Ahhhh I missed u so much !!!! 😘😘
Probably a lot of these comments but your hair looks really good in this video
You're skin looks so good in this video. Making you look like baby simply
She is not a salon manicurist, couldn't pass the test when she tried it, and used a nail powder that specifically said it was only for professional use  But somehow did it well enough for real manicurists to steal the imagery
The Arabic one killed I’m Arab so I’m used to seeing people steal shit.
SPIILL DAT TEA QWEEN
6:19 it's not spanish
I just love how Cristine has to call herself to order
How do you feel about companies where you’ve actually used their product but it’s not sponsored using images from that video to advertise? Slightly better because at least it’s the right product or still shady?
“I can’t read Spanish” They clearly write “Brasil” in the beginning, Cristiiiiine! Don’t do us like that, we speak PORTUGUEEEEESE hahahaha
-I can't read Spanish! ~Portuguese - Detected
💯💯💯💯🤣🤣🤣✌✌
The girl that does my nails here knows and loves you, but she doesn't steal images from your content to advertise! On the contrary, every time I go, we cheer for holo together and drool over your new products!
Idk but anyone else getting Troom Troom vibes from the way the text was written at 4:37!? 🤣🤣🤣
Cristine, this is not Spanish, but portuguese! Also a 'gringa' is a foreigner, a woman from another country ( if it were a man, it would be a gringo ). It's a common use word in Portuguese and in Spanish.
Hey Cristine, I don't know if you will read this but I am so glad I stuck around with you for a long time. Something about the "wish" video you made a couple of years ago didn't sit right with me. You and Ben talked about the poor ethical conditions that their workers were probably working on and then went ahead and made, not one, but two videos about it. I was incredibly disappointed with you for those videos. I still love you for all the other things you do and say on your channel. When you said 'I am not going to buy products from these companies and not support them in any way' I legit felt so proud. I am not trying to police you or your content but buying products and supporting those companies in any small way would have disappointed me further. I am glad you didn't take that route and did what you did instead. You stuck by what you believed in and I see growth! Love you guys and your content as always!!
Simply your face looks like  a potato 🥔 without contouring
Cristine: I can't understand spanish. Me: DAFUQ THAT'S NOT EVEN SPANISH GIRL WTF
...excuse me, are you using a rubber mallet as a gavel?
I think I know why salons use your thumbnails. If you google "rainbow chrome nails" or "dip powder nails", your thumbnails come up. These companies pick the photos with words on them so it saves them time from having to add text to the poster. So maybe they don't realize they're stealing from you specifically. Maybe they just think it's a regular pic from google. Then again, pics on google are usually copyrighted too.
She looks like the old cristene WITHOUT MAKEUP
“They probably steal my hair” I’m dead byeee🤣🤣🤣🤣
That is not spanish, it’s portuguese 😂
The way you handle your hair reminded me of youtuber Boynaband :D
most ppl: oh shit thes ho's stole ur nail pics  me/all the fans: ILL SUE YOU FUCKER !! also me/evaryone: 👁️👄👁️💅🏼
Oof that person that be like "I know that black desk and I know those candy corn nails* WAS LITERALLY ME. Cristine I haven't seen any of these types of ads just cause I'm not on the internet alot but wherever I am or WHATEVER IM ON I will keep a look out it's not right that they keep stealing creators content they're a bunch of thieves and honestly deserve to go to court but I guess we cant do much about it
just wanted to say cristine looked great in this video, her face looks hella refreshed and we love to see it
As a nail technician professionally, I will say that you are correct in that it is hard to run a business and get clients in general, that said if they feel they need to steal content to advertise their salon, that's a salon I would never want to go to. They're what we in the nail tech community refer to as a "chop shop" aka the place you're likely to get some sort of an infection from due to unclean tools. If they can't figure out advertising that's their own, I wouldn't go to them.
Spanish speaker here...we use gringo and gringa to make fun of white people lmaoooo
There is so much sass in this video. Cristine is in a mood lol I love it
"i can't read spanish" brazilians/portuguese everywhere: *oh no* *oh no* *oh no no no no no*
You've been replaced. You are way to tan to be cristenE WHO ARE YOU
Bro I’m dead they should be embarrass🤣ILY❤️
IT'S NOT SPANISH!!! IT IS PORTUGUESE
7:28 بغيت افطس لما عرفت ان فيه عربي  مدري ليه😭😭😭😭 اصلاً عادي احس اني الوحيده العربيه الوحيده يلي تتابعها🧍‍♀️
Oh no girl, that's not Spanish, that's Portuguese!!!!!  For us brazilians, it's like mistaking iridescent for holo 💿💿💿
I told a company that there item was stolen and my family got mad at me and called me a Caren
There too lazy you do the legwork themselves that's why there stealing your material. I have gotten most of nail tips for you. I love you content and I would to buy some of you nail polish. But with this Cov-19 going on. I just don't have the money.
6:00 it's portuguese ahahah. people always think Portuguese is Spanish... :(
SUE THEM ALL!!!!!
6:23 can someone tell me what this says?
The positive thing you can get from this is : you can defintively be a nail model!!!!
I was lowkey waiting for a cameo from LegalEagle
I swear its a generational thing. You can google something and for some reason, Google Images will show Youtube thumbnails. I'm guessing older people or even younger ones don't know that they aren't necessarily fair use. It just all goes back to art theft. 😑
Simply: i can't read spanish The screen: in Portuguesse, has brasil written on the add  🤣🤣🤣
Gringa is not necessarily mean... but not nice either
Whoa! I'm sorry you are going through this, Beautiful! A ton of hugs♡♡♡♡ love you
simply throwing shade :D
As an American who is half Hispanic, I’m genuinely curious if Spanish is often taught int Canada? I know French would be the most common second language, but is Spanish as commonly taught there as it is in the States? I figured that was why Cristine couldn’t differentiate Spanish from Portuguese.
I'm glad you shared this. I had a small twitter account with just over 400 followers. All I did there was shit post and share pictures of something I liked on a walk or something. Well, I managed to get a picture of a snowflake on my glasses and shared it with my followers. Somehow it went crazy and ended up with over 1.5 million likes and my followers went from 400 to over 4,000. This lead to people stealing that photo and sharing it on other platforms and didn't give credit until after they were called out by others who knew it wasn't taken by them. They even took it as far as lying about what camera it was taken with...
You look beautiful in every video but you look extra AMAZING today
What is on cristine's right hand?! Is it out on holotaco?
Todo dia um gringo diferente confundindo português com espanhol
The Arabic ( exhibit c I think) one was saying: "the latest technology for making ur nails look better,  it's a printer that can print out any picture from your phone onto your nails in 35 seconds"
Hey Trump! This is how you build a case! There's a think called proof and evidence, give it a try!
That’s not Spanish, that’s portuguese🙂
You forgot selling Ben and his nails!
6:28 I'm from Spain and I think that's Portuguese... but its very similar to Spanish and I belive it says: the new fever (as in new trend) among the gringas (which I belive its like a way to refer to white people but like English speakers mostly? I'm not very familiar with the term, it must be Portuguese from South America, but I dont know for sure. What I'm sure of its that that lenguage comes from latin)
6:18 Sorry simply that aint spanish.
Cristine: I can't read spanish That's portuguese, not spanish 😂💕
I know you live in Canada, but wanna take Amy Coney Barretts place on the US supreme court?
I wonder if that dip powder brand is using the image and giving it to stores to hang
“I can’t read Spanish” it was Portuguese lol
My favourite part about the dip polish nails thumbnail is that it has a question mark on “nails”  So without context it’s just like “maybe you’ll have nails after this”
Okay so Cristina I speak Arabic and that said the latest thing in nail technology a printer that prints anything on your nails through your phone in 35 secs only just if you wanted to know a lot of love from Egypt
The "Gringa" was not mean at all (it's portuguese btw ) Love you ♥️
When Christine said “wait so they have my nails and my footage and also have my-“ ads started playing before she said voice and I choked on my water at the irony.
Love how her fear of going to a hair salon is because they'll steal her hair lmao
6:20 NO CHRISTINE, IT'S NOT SPANISH, IT'S BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE
Of all Nailogicals honorable and loyal followers do we have any lawyers here???? Help this girl out!!! She has come so far... Wish there was something we can do. Keep posting on their garbage what thieves they are!!!!
Omg I just thought of an idea! Cristine, you should print out your thumbnails to be really small, tape them to your wall, then throw the computer mouse symbol at them and whichever it lands on you have to try again, obviously make the computer mouse symbol sticky or something like that, maybe double-sided tape or slow dry glue? Just an idea I came up with while watching you look at your thumbnails printed out on the big posters.
Finallyyyyy!!! They’ve (rando companies) have been doing it for so long and j always call them out
I love how she says its Spanish when its portuguese
You look really good today!!!
the dip powder thumbnail posters crack me up cause of the question mark like "get dip powder nails? from us? idk?"
Its not Spanish,  is portugueses
EXCUSE ME THOSE ARE MY NAILS IN THAT CLIP AT 14:33😡 Thank you for sharing and show off the dark side of online marketing❤
6:19 broke me kkk "I cAnT rEaD SpAnIsH" wrong language but omg I'm  dying
LOL thats portuguese not spanish
yay simply content x3
simplykarenlogical
Criiiiiis, did you see how to cook that's holo chocolate video?!
Your skin looks amazing here! Hope you have figured out the allergy situation!
I bet you anything all those posters in the salons are being sold on amazon
The irony that Canada doesn’t even use gavels
I wouldn't be surprised about 'gringas.' It's mainly to tell other locals if you're American or not
Oh Cristine 😅 The "A nova febre entre as gringas" it's actually portuguese, and yes, its like you said, it would be translated "the hottest trend among the foreigners".
It's not Spanish it's Portuguese in the video
cristine :: don't forget to use a watermark!   also cristine :: *doesnt use a watermark*
your so beautiful without make up its lovely to see 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Wow
"Mice-nail-eous" wow, it hurts to know that Cristine ACCIDENTALLY came up with a better pun than anything I'll ever say on purpose
When I saw the text and Cristine said she didnt know Spanish I was like that ain’t Spanish lol I could only understand gringa 😂😂😂
You, as well as the other creators with their content stolen, should be straightened out. This also shows that they’re to lazy to even use their own products. They may be afraid to advertise their own product since they think they’re  so bad. Which is why they stole your, and many other creators content since some use, or reviewed them. Which is really sucky in my opinion for the company’s to steal it.
When they used bens nails 😂
That's mildly upsetting… What can we do to help Cristine?
"Gringo" comes from "Green go". It is a slur that originated in the border between the US and Mexico and it refers to the color of the uniforms of border patrol officers. However it is used throughout Latin America to refer to any english-speaking and/or white foreign person.
yeah, gringa is typically a mean slur 😅🤣
In the 6:03 part that wasn't spanish, it was portuguese.
Cristine have you ordered diffraction sheets? I assume the only reason you aren't making How To Cook That's holo chocolate right now is because you are waiting for the diffraction sheets to arrive!
Even tho that's not spanish, over here in Puerto Rico we call gringos/gringas to people from the USA (especially white ppl). In a derogatory way, yeah.
Exhibit B: these motherfuckers straight up called her a racial slur lmao (as a Latino, trust me I know.)
Here for the teaaaaa
brubrurhruhb NOT COOL "BETCH"
I laughed when that ad called you a gringa 😂
time for some dmcas :)
Can u make a video of u doing nail art on ur toes
Ben: Are you hammering something down here? lmao
Pretty sure the very first piece of music was Neopets Key quest.
Use me as a petition button to put Christines watermark back in the videos
I got my frosted metals box yesterday and holy cow! they're so shiny and with a flakie holo taco they're so mesmerizing
very accurate Cristine. Gringo is used smong Latinx people to address white people, which should stop, but its kinda funny
Oh. I didn't know I needed this video so badly, but I did. I always get a fierce pride when I go to comment and tell these companies off for using your property without your permission, and then see a bunch of us fans have already commented. ❤🤧 long live Simply! PS damn gurl you got a tan since I saw you last, also BRAD MONDO will totally do your hair for you, I wanna see the collab pls you can do his nails for him for your channel and he'll do your hair for his it'll be perfection
Have you used color street? Any opinions?
that second video isnt spanish
luv thats not spanish
you dont speak portuguese cristine, thats a brazilian video written in portuguese, not the same as spanish...
You are lucky you are not in the art community, art theft/tracing/recoloring is common here and people gave up on trying to sue others for art theft
I found Cristine and her videos by accident, but I simply love them. I love her sense of humor -Ben is the sweetest thing!
that was actually portuguese! it basically means what you thought: "the new fever/trend among foreigners".  in brazil, everyone who is not brazilian can be called a "gringo" or "gringa". it is not meant as a bad thing here 😬 it is mostly used for americans. for example: "are you a gringo?" usually means "are you american?"  (i think in spanish speaking countries it can be used to make fun of foreigners)
Cristine: *sees Ben's cuticle and face*  Also Cristine: I'LL SUE!  Me: omg why are they so cuuuuuteeee ❤❤❤
IT WAS PORTUGUESE CRISTENEEEE  nooooooo i really trusted you i thought that canadians knew better than the people in the us
Actually, I'm from Brazil and the term "gringa" isn't offensive, it just refers to girls from english speaking coutries. Luv ur videos Lol
Google translate doesnt work with sentences you have to do it word by word and kinda piece it together
You are pretty 💜
YOU SHOULD DO GOING TO A NAIL SALON AND ASKING THEM TO RECREATE SOME OF YOUR MOST FAMOUS NAIL LOOKS!
I have Finnaaaalllyy been able to buy holo taco! In Australia and have had to wait for good exchange rates and the free shipping helped me do it now finally 🥳🥳🥳 a friend knew i was hanging out for it and bought me a flakie taco bottle earlier on so i know how absolutely amazing the colour vibrancy and quality is compared to the only $3 holo options in our drugstores. SO EXCITED!
That's brazilian portuguese Simply not spanish , ;-; 💔🇧🇷
Oh yes simply court logical 💞
HAVE YOU SEEN THE HOLO CHOCOLATE THO????  (How to Cook That with Ann Reardon)
6:19 it's not spanish
Gringa 7s also used to call a hispanic girl whose not tanned or native American skin. I look white but I'm Puerto rican and I get called gringa alot by strangers lol
How did she miss the significance of the first definition of gringa was "a kind of taco". A HOLO taco, if you will!
i miss you Cristine❤️✨✨✨✨✨😍😍
12:43 HAS ME CACKLING
“You gonna sell some socks?” Are you??? SimplySocks?????? Please??
Hahaha, I guess gringo can be a bit insulting. It's what the mexicans called the US troops when they were fighting ages ago: "Green go!" Cause they were using green uniforms... so... gingo.
As someone who speaks Portuguese and uses the word gringa alot among me and my friends, I can tell that gringa is used to say something like 'she speaks a foreign language like English'. Gringa basically means she doesn't speak our language
It’s funny because most nail salons really can’t do complicated designs, I’ve had to go to at home / non salon nail workers because the salons don’t do really cool/difficult design, so I’m sure if I walked into a nail salon and said “hi, yes I want the design you’re advertising” they aren’t gonna know what to do with it 😭😂
Maam that’s a rubber mallet
Gringa means white girl lol my husband is Dominican 😂he can attest to it
15:11 - Cristines eyeball!! Perfect placement!! 🤣🤣🤣
Bet all the unlikes r the company's that stole her nail-identity
I literally saw her raindrop nails on aliexpress
Gringo is technically "green, go" that Hispanics used to say to American solders who wore green uniforms. Gringa is the female form.
gringa is not related to race!! it just mean foreigners, in brazil (that ad was in brazilian portuguese) we use it for everyone that isn't brazilian
ok this is my favorite simply video of the year, for sure. LOVEEE this style of well-researched analytical commentary now i NEED to see Judge Cristine tear down other problematic beauty industry business practices, drop that holo hammer on em
6:19 its portuguese! And i say that because im argentinian and i speak spanish hahahaha
The video was Brazilian Portuguese and not Spanish 👉👈  Edit: Gringa means someone from outside Brazil like North Americans, Europeans and more...
I saw a holo taco add and I was like yesssss go 💿✨simply✨💿
Hi simply my name is Cynthia and I've watched your videos ever since I was a kid in middle School and I'm currently 21 at the moment but that definition of gringa is not a respectful way putting it out there see I'm from Argentina myself and the Spanish that we speak is more European based meaning it's more proper than if you were to hear it from a Puerto Rican or a Mexican where it's more centralized America and for them gringo/or/gringa may not mean as harmful to them but it is very harmful and disrespectful if you are speaking from a higher level of education or if someone is cussing another person out. Another way to call a person American is Yanquis (yankees) it's all about anyone who really does have a "human" in them 💖🤗😇
fyi that was portuguese, not spanish
Shania Twain be like, “Come On Over...to COURT”
"I can't read spanish" it's Brazilian portuguese, honey.
Simply Podlogical called..... They want their intro song back
HAAHHAHAA yes that’s exactly what gringo is cuz when they came to latin america we didnt know english and we would say GREEN GO! because their uniforms were green
I love the hair😍😍😍
The companies be real quiet since this video
Cristine, I think you look particularly pretty in this video. Maybe it's the hair, or maybe it's the (possible) lack of makeup.
republicans are shaking from cristine’s thorough analysis of legitimate fraud 🤣🤣🤣
I love it when I see her stolen content on Facebook or Instagram and I see the simply fam already going in on them.
Well, when I was in Central America, gringo specifically referred to foreign people from the USA, and their all green money.
i love how cristine not only checks google for a definition, but after goes immediately to urban dictionary.
Simply the whole time: that's not cool. Simply when ben's nails and face pops up: I'LL SUE YOU!!!!!!!!
Simple: I can't read spanish   Me, a mexican girl:  That's portuguese... no manches xD
They didn't even bother covering up her water mark properly in some. Smh.
7:28 the post talking about the printer as new technology the can print on your nail in 38 sec and there is link to the page of the printer "i don't think that's ad "
Cristine why the f did you called my Portuguese Spanish?? Not ship to Brazil isn't enough? Seriously though, that's Portuguese, not Spanish
Exhibit B is in Portuguese, not Spanish :) But in both languages, Gringa is the equivalent to saying “White girl”
“I can’t read Spanish “ Text is in Portuguese
it was portuguese cris nooooooooooooooooooo
You looking up the definition of gringas made my day and I really needed that so I just wanted to say thank you
Dying laughing when she figures out GRINGAS.
I have this problem with a Doctor Who wallpaper I made, it's all over mousepads and bags and all sorts of crap, it pisses me off!
7.69M subs  Congrats and funny number
Gringa is sorta mean ...
Fans will always be the best investigators
it´s not spanish, it's brazilian portuguese. I HATE WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT MY LANGUAGE IS SPANISH
Lol. I can tell you that is not Spanish. But gringa in Spanish does mean white girl.
If you can't beat em - profit - Start Selling Dip Powder Nails posters!!! Official Simply Merch!
The part that you search on Google is not spanish is Portuguese
Omg! It wasn’t Spanish, it was Brazilian Portuguese 🤦🏻‍♀️ as a Brazilian fan i as like “oh no ☹️”
the real question here is from where did Cristine get a holo hammer 💿
Wow that’s Crazy
No Cristine, "Gringo" isn't an insult lmao it's quite literally just slang. I don't understand why most people think it's ill intended.
For 7:26 that language is Arabic. It says:  “The lastest extent technology has verged into includes beautifying the nails. It is a printer that paints for you any photo that you have on your phone, onto your nails in the span of 35 seconds, exclusively in Algeria.”  (For more info go to our page)         You’re welcome 😂
Thing with the dip powder nail (stolen) posters is the poster doesn't even look good lmao. I don't mean the actual image is bad, because as a thumbnail it serves its purpose - it shows the dip powder, has a nice aesthetic, and has a question ("dip powder nails?") which intrigues the viewer and makes them click the video, job done.  As a poster? If I see a poster in a nail salon that's posing a question as to what the technique is, then I know it must be stolen from somewhere and the salon is lazy, so I wouldn't trust them. As a POSTER it gives me barely any solid information. It's a bit shit. I want salons to actively tell me "this is a good technique, come and get it done" rather than "dip powder nails.... we guess?".
Even though you can't go after the companies, you can show this to Facebook who has power to not advertise these.
Judge Cristine coming out! 👏👏👑
gringo doesn't mean white girl, it just means 'foreigner', the ad was just telling that whatever was happening in the video was the new trend overseas :B
6:19 that’s not Spanish Cristine 🤣🤣 It’s Portuguese. The ad even said it’s a new product in Brazil
Cristine: “I have no idea of what is being written because I can’t read spanish”  Me a brazilian: Yeah haha, spanish...
"I can't understand Spanish" That ain't Spanish 😭😂😂
I'm not sure if gringa is mean BUT in Brazil we use it as a slang for foreign people, anyone from any country
Gringa in spanish is urban for white girl
Finally o other video
I bet the nail salons are shopping for posters from a company who stole your design. They might not even know that it's stolen content. Let me see if I can google up anything.
“i can’t read spanish” ma’am that’s portuguese
'I can't read spanish' I facepalmed so hard when Christine said that.
You should start adding a watermark to each fingertip next to the nail or maybe on it... and also every two inches of your face.
The salon thing is probably people just google image searching “dip powder nails” or whatever and using an image seen on there without context. If you search that your thumbnail is the first thing that comes up that looks like it could be a sign. It’s still a bit shady to just take that without looking at the context but it’s easy to see why so many salons use that image.
i really wanted to see ben's reaction to HIS cuticles and HIS nails being shown on an ad
Wow never noticed how much I see ur stuff on pinterest and other sites WOW
Thank you judge Simply! 🧐
Please recreate polish mountain but with every single polish you own.
Me as a Brazilian: I don't... speak Spanish either :,(
I wanna see Ben's reaction to his nails (and face) being in that one ad
Bahdaltou bina ya jadak lol 🇩🇿
Would commenting something like "this is stolen" incentivize them to steal more because they gain engagement that way?
It’s been a hot minute since we’ve had a troom troom video. Is there a specific reason? I kinda miss them.
It's surprising how a lot of people don't even think there's anything wrong. I saw someone who makes ferniture explain that not all pictures they use are their own, but they show what they can use. Well, then, make it, and take a picture 🤷🏻‍♀️
gotta love the Ben cameo - even though he knows Cristine is always up to crazy things he still comes to check on her!
As someone who has studied some Spanish in my life, they are saying something mean.
Off topic.. Cristine looks beautiful
Ok but thank you for not buying scam products. So many people buy the scam products and compare them to the real thing but then it gets weird because they add links and stuff and you shouldn’t advertise bad companies
6:18 that's not Spanish, it's Portuguese LMAO
"I can't read spanish"  Brazilians: AM I JOKE????
Everything was fine until Cristine saw the Portuguese advertisement (yes, Portugués/Brasilian Portuguese) and she said SPANISH! I am offended, I want to put a demand and have my money back 🤣🤣🤣
I feel like the nail salons did not print or design those posters/signs themselves but ordered them from a distributor.
Simplypolice going to all these pages and calling them out 🧐
IM SO SORRY THEY CALLED YOU GRINGA WHEN YOU ARE NOT EVEN FROM THE STATES AJSJSJSJ oh god i know its not as funny as it seams, pero es que no tenes plante de gringa por como actúas JAJA
Thats not spanish
If you see something like this on Facebook, don't only comment on the posts. Comments can easily be removed. Angry react to the post as well. The page can't remove reacts like it does comments.
Hol' up something's off here... Cristine's hair is tripping me.
6:18 “because I can’t ready spanish” yeah and you don’t even know that’s not Spanish lol
I miss you Screaming "Beyyynnnnnn" for TEA
WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH
6:15 Cristine! I had faith in you.... that is Portuguese from Brazil
“Isn’t it weird to see YouTube thumbnails printed out” *me printing another thumbnail to hang on my simply shrine* hm??    Jk
Go check out @howtocookthat 's holo chocolate tutorial christine! <3
🤣
Cut out the middle man, just start selling large prints of your YouTube thumbnails to salons!
You totally should buy them!!!!!!!
Bold move to steal from a criminologist working for the government but okay
When Ben’s face in the frame showed up 🤣🤣 They couldn’t even TRY.
"Binders of Afidavidts" I literally choked on my coffee.
Is that holo taco stickers on that mallet?! I want one!!
That was Portuguese, not Spanish 🙄🤣
I just would like to address that we speak Portuguese in Brazil. Thanks
Cristine, you are so beautiful!!
Cristine, the ad wasn't in spanish, it was portuguese lmao my ear is bleeding from hearing that haha
Qualitea content 👍🏻
I GOT A HOLO TOCO AD!!!!! :D
For the "Gringa" add, it is in portuguese, not spanish; but "gringo" and/or "gringa" is used in Latin America in general to refer to english native speakers (americans, candians, british) and even white and blonde people in general 😅
I respect the amount of restraint you have in this video, if anyone started reselling my drawings on t-shirts and stuff I would become the human embodiment of unbridled rage
Is it just me or has Christine glowed up recently? I love it tho😏❤️
So excited for my first Holo Taco💅🏼 order! Why oh why is FedEx taking SO LONGGGGGGG!
Hey Cristine! I'm a brazilian fan and "Gringa" in Brazil means someone who's not from Brazil. Usually someone who speaks english, or its from north america or europe. It can have a negative connotation, but in the video it's not negative! its like "its a trend to gringas", meaning its a trend in other countries (so its something popular).
Darling that's exactly what 'a nova febre entra as gringas' mean but it's Portuguese not Spanish haha yet don't worry it wasn't mean at all
1. your hair looks so healthy and shiny omg 2 thanks for not naming the real businesses. what an ethical queen
when i strted watching you when i was like 8  (im 11) the water mark  always annoyed me but now i understand it needs to be there  lol
SHE GET BUFF TO PUNCH ON THESE STEALERINOS
The actual sheer audacity of these rubbish 'businesses'...
The gringa parte wasn't spanish, it was portuguese 😂
Honestly with the dip powder nails I bet someone ripped the thumbnail and then put it on some website or something for free/cheap ads or signs. It just seems weird to me that all these salons happen to stumble across the same thing?
Exhibit B is actually in Portuguese 😅
At 6:20 it's Portuguese, not Spanish But it's ok
I can't believe there's actually nothing you can do against that.. I mean you said you tried, you talked to lawyers which means you obv know better but I'm genuinly baffled that that's just not a possibility.   They can just do whatever they want and bc they happened  to  be overseas  they.. can get away with it. Really weird. And absolutely disgusting, honestly.
do you have a pintrest
I hate seeing this kind of crap behavior from companies. It doesn't just happen in the beauty world either. I knit & crochet and I am continually letting pattern designers know that crap foreign companies are stealing their product photos to promote their cheap, nasty knockoffs. What's the absolute worst is when they're stealing images that have children in them. There really does need to be some sort of international law set up regarding misuse of images for the purpose of profit.
You should buy all of this product and make a video rating them
"Gringa" it's just a informally and funny way to say "female english native speaker", depends the situation to be a mean word or not.
"I can't read Spanish" says simply of a video in Portuguese  proving the gringa part right lol. also not knowing what gringa means...
Sis just spilled the tea☕️
LMFAO gringa is commonly used as a defamatory term for "white girl"
AAA THATS NOT SPANISH LOLLL its brazilian portuguese!! they mean that "its a huge fever around foreigners (basically anyone that isnt brazilian)" and we dont use it as a mean term dont worry <33 its just an informal word that we use sorry that this company from my country stole your content :/ i dont even know who they are lol theyre probably a really small company that thought you'd never know they used your stuff without permission btw i love your content <33 kisses from brazil!!
no, ThEy'D sTeAL mY hAiR
OMG I LOVE YOU
The dislikes are from the shady owners of companies who stole from Simply.
Resident Mexican here to say: gringa just means white girl!
Same with artwork! So many companies (and celebrities sometimes??) use artwork without the artist’s knowledge or permission. It’s so frustrating because when massive companies do it... what chance does one artist have to stop them?
Please show Ben his stolen nails and film his reaction. I bet the look on his face will be priceless.
I was happy and sad she was going to talk about Brazil Cristine: I can't read spanish Me: T_T
I had an idea for holo taco. Monochromatic boxes or, build your own box. Since the collection boxes sell out fast. Can create your own  collection
the jury sees the defendants GUILTY! OF THEFT!
Love how she didn't buy the products, they don't deserve any money from their illicit acts. I always find   it weird when people review knockoffs
Hi ilyyy
14:35 I would like to order a Ben, thanx
Spanish speaker watching this video 👀                                                                👄
Back when I did nails, constantly seeing friends stuff stolen was infuriating
Gringa/gringo  means white person (at least thats how my own social circles use it).
Omg google translate is the worst Nova means girlfriend like damm get it right
Cristine! That's not Spanish, its portuguese and yes you're a gringa but its not mean, it just means you're from outside Latin America
can we just take a moment and appreciate how naturally beautiful cristine is?
I was told, in the USA latino people use the term "Gringo" as an offensive slang to talk about white people. But in Brazil (where that video was from) we use the word "Gringo/Gringa" just as a way to say "foreigner", so that would be translated as "The new hottest trend among foreigners!", with no offensive means intended.
ALL the tea is being spilt ☕️👏🏻🙌🏻
Companies like that are disgusting. I remember seeing Sierra Schultzie’s photo being used as a “before” photo for weight-loss
I know I was looking up online websites and stuff and clips of you tell me like I was like Christine
My Brazilian ass at 6:12   Is that... Portuguese?!  Edit: that video is saying that the new trend between foreigners has been doing polygel at home and that it lasts up to 20 days so everyone should hurry to buy their kit, etc.  Btw Cristine really called Portuguese Spanish, huh? 😂
Your hair looks beautiful 🥺🥺
I can't read spanish.... Cristine, it's portuguese :l
*OH MY FCKING GOD* she looks sooo BEAUTIFUL without makeup I never realised 😱😱
Can we talk about how good cristines hair looks in this video
Gringa is like white girl
I will tell my mom to travel to Canada just so she can take your case and you can win
Let's take a minute to appreciate Christine's nail polish collection and her sequin pillows
For some reason cristine looks more like Jen in this vid
For B I’m going to sum it up bc a bish is Latina, so they were selling to the (who I predict) the Dominican people who do long extensions saying that we will give u this polygel kit so that they can do it at home instead of in the salon. That’s my little rant, byeeeee
7:32 it’s says : The latest technology used in nail art and its a printer that prints any picture you have in your phone onto your nails in 35 seconds  Only in Algeria ( as if lol )  Click on the link and you’ll be directed to the website that sells the product  . . This is shitty advertising lol 😹😹😹
@Simply Nailogical  I found the translation...The New Fever Among Gringo...which somewhat makes sense
gringa JAJAJAJAJAJA que malos
a lot of fb ads are always fake! never trust them
That is not Spanish baby Cristine
Where can I get one of those Holo Taco stickers ????? 👀
Also Shania..... That don’t impress me much. Dnt dnt dnt dnt
"Gringa" is a word we use to call foreigners, specifically the north americans , it could be used in a deregotary way or not,it just depends.
I just got my holo taco order today and it is amazing😊😊😊
Most of those companies are doing drop shipping as well, so if you want the product just check AliExpress or Wish and buy it from there (unless it's a store that stole her photos too)
Gringos are white people lololol
I love crinstean
I need legal eagle to review this for accuracy lol
They stole Beeeeeyns picture!!!
In the criminal justice system, nail-stealing offenses are considered especially heinous. In Ottawa, the supposed nail artist who investigates this bulls*** is an elite squad known as Holo Taco.   ...where is Legal Eagle when you need him?!
LET BRAD MONDO CHOP OFF THAT HAIR, MISS
*Among white girls if you were wondering*
I’m getting her polish for Christmas! I’m so excited much love form florida!🤍
its not Spanish its Portuguese.
that's not spanish tho lol it's portuguese
This is so funny to watch!! 😂😂😂 just a mini correction... that is no spanish,  it’s portugués 😂
She: I can’t read Spanish  Me: is Portuguese 🙃
I wonder if someone is selling the dip pic on a stock site. Much easier than stealing from YouTube.
cRiStInE DiD sOmEtHiNg WiTh HeR hAiR ( it looks beautiful btw )
I think why that dip powder nails thumbnail is so popular is because it would come up if you just googled "dip powder nails" and for the other thumbnails of course
Gringa = white girl
THE SPANISH ONE HOLY😂😂
Ahhhh that wasn’t Spanish, ‘twas Portuguese, Cristine XD
Shoutout to that person from Lafayette, LA😂✌🏻thats where i live
I couldn’t pull off your nails at all my nails are short as hell lol
I want to know what Ben thinks about this and his nails being stolen
Portuguese (Brazilian Portuguese, to be even more specific). NOT SPANISH.
I wonder how Ben reacted to knowing his face and nails were used too for that one ad.
Then you ask them for the design on the poster and they say "we can do something like that sure... I mean it won't be exactly that..."
" turn that red button green!" I gotta know, was that a Bull reference? From turning the mirror jurors green? haha <3
cristine reminds me of my sister and watching her vids always makes me so happy since i can’t always talk to my sis (she’s 31 and has an actual life unlike me lol)
6:23 that's Portuguese not Spanish, more specifically Brazilian Portuguese
Sorry baby it is not Spanish
Gringa, is how we called the females from the us, here in latin america
Omg her hair is so pretty
The part where you thought where it was spanish its portuguese It says "now in brazil " "polygel can be done at home"
I'm surprised they haved used your hair for like hair growth products that would be one hell of a good selling point ehh! Hahaha....I love your hair BTW and also have super long locks myself. Anyways this shit is so crazy some people give absolutely no fucks they know exactly what they do and just don't care, the products they sell are probably complete shit and thats why they use yours and others images cause they can't use there own product. Also they think we are dumb and won't put it together or even fact check whether you are actually working with them. In any instance its absolute shit.
no more ms.nice cristine the holo queen.Naah get your ass to court 😂
Yes, use that ban hammer girl
CRISTINE, IT'S PORTUGUESE( A nova febre entre as gringas) NOT SPANISH. In Brazil we speak Portuguese. Lmao love u Queen
THAT'S NOT SPANISH, CRISTINE... also lmao how do you not know what gringa means? ahaha it just means "foreigner from north america/europe" here in Brasil (where we speak Portuguese, not Spanish)
“Order on the internet” is never gonna happen XD
I just LOVE Simply Nailogical, don't you?
That was not Spanish it was portuguese from Brazil
The robot part says  The latest technology to do nail and it is a printer that draws for you any picture you have on your telephone on your nails in the time span of 35 seconds new and only in the use.  I speak arabic and this is how I saw it was written if any words were wrong ngl I do not care enough
by not taking their own images and videos, they save tons of money not having to produce ads. also their products wont work like the ones in the videos, so that adds another layer of scammin; they wont be able to recreate the ad if they tried any ways
"I can't speak spanish" I AM EXTREMELY OFFENDED. VERY. WOW.
Cheeky wee mothers!!!!
Is it only me or does Cristine look extra cute today? Who am I kidding, she always does.
Lmaoo gringo is how we call americans basically, it's not mean unless you intended it to be mean
Cristine is so pretty!!
I never realized how creepy it  must be to see a picture of your own nails being advertised by a random salon....weird.
Apologies for someone In my country stealing your stuff, but just a correction, we don’t speak Spanish in Brazil, we speak Portuguese
Use me as here before million views button      👇🏻
cristine, Colombian here!!! Latin americans use Gringa or Gringo to refer to person from the US... It was explained to me that it originated during a mexican-american war where mexican said Green, go! (as in leave)
Don’t call our girl gringa, she Canadian, she don’t count
Gringo means tourist/ non-local.
Minute 6:18, lemme correct you, that is NOT Spanish. Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese.  Edit: Gringo is slang Latino/Hispanics use to refer to Americans.
On instagram people can use your photos and you cannot go to court with them. Well, you can but you won't win https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21221078/stephanie-sinclair-mashable-instagram-embed-copyright-lawsuit-dismissed
Her hair looks amazing
YESSSS YOU TELL EMM
This has turned to “simplyexposelogical”
6:20 I'm pretty sure is not spanish, it's portuguese 🙄
“A nova febre entre as gringas” means a new fever among white people😂😂😂
The arabic ad is talking about the product which is a "printer for your nails exclusive to algeria" hilarious
You should do a video buying and testing the products that steal your content.
Your gavel is a rubber mallet 🤣🤣🤣
"I have no idea what's going on or what's being written because I can't read spanish" the ad: * is in Portuguese *
We only use "gringo" for people who live in USA or born there.
not the gavel lmao
Casually watching at 3am feels nostalgic❤
6:17 i dont know what that says either because thats not spanish 😅
Gringa is very derogatory.
NOT THEM CALLING YOU A GRINGA LMFOAOIOOOOO
girl this is portuguese it says brasil below
The brazilian add was yes refering to the "new hot thing amongst north american girls". The word fever is used here as a slang for something very very trendy (I dunno if you guys have that sort of slang here too) and usually when brazilians refer to gringo they are refering to north american people mostly but I think they would call you a gringo if you came to them speaking english and assume you are american. Some foreign people find it offensive and as far as I know it used to be used as a mean way to refer to a foreign person, but tbh today I don't see it being used in that way as much. In the add they clearly were using it as a selling point, that since it was popular with foreign nail art youtubers it was probably a good product. Basically it was like: see that thing you saw simply nail logical using we have our own version of the product being done in brazil. I don't think they meant girngo in a mean way more in referring to the fact that it was popular mostly outside of brazil and now it was arriving in the country.
I miss the simpler times when the like button turned blue
Honestly you should actually sue them, it’s really not ok for them to steal yours and other people’s footage or pictures without their permission..
Lol you should buy the products and try to do the original nail design and compare
You're the bigger person and I appreciate how you explain your thought process thanks for bringing attention.
Okay but Cristine looks FIRE with her hair down!🔥
omg its PORTUGUESE, not spanish! every time!
LMAOOOO I STARTED LAUGHING SO HARD WHEN THEY USED A PIC OF BEN 🤣🤣
On that last one I think you should sue. Scratch that, I KNOW you should. They’re scam artists for certain
7:28 translation  This is what technology reached..and this is a printer print for you any picture you have in the phone...on the nails for 35 seconds only...only in Morocco
That wasn’t Spanish in the ad it’s definitely Portuguese
cristine its not to sell socks that they want your feet for....feet pics are real money by themselves :(
I feel like the nail salon with the dip powder picture didn’t take it straight from your channel. They probably googled it and  print a random picture and it happened to be your thumbnail.
The fact is, most of these people are not aware that they shouldn't use those pictures. They feel that they can use it cuz it's public. I don't know if they are aware that it's wrong, atleast in my country ppl don't know.. They take some viral vids and put it up 🤦🏾‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Isn't it amazing to see Christine's hair down?
Hi, gringo or gringa is not offensive, is just a slang for foreigner
The one thing I happy about this is that there is someone other than me in Argentina that loves your content Btw that was Portuguese
Cristine... the video at 11:29 is in portuguese, not Spanish 😔
The second video is not in Spanish but in Portuguese.  And "gringa" is just a very informal way of referring to people from English-speaking countries.
cristine: I can't read spanish video: *is in portuguese*
noo gringa no es ofensivo, es pa decir que es extranjero pero no inmigrante de hecho es como racista  xdddd
I gotta say that I _personally_ think that the small picture above the dip powder shelf at 11:17 isn’t as bad a case of stealing images as other examples in this video. Maybe I got the wrong impression, but to me, it seemed like they carelessly (which admittedly is not the best approach as a business either) took a photo from the internet and used it to ‘mark’ their shelf – as in ‘this is where we keep our dip powders!  Pick your favourite for your manicure!’
im not even kidding i was telling my dad how my bro wanted some earbuds and he looked on amazon and i said those are all fake- and then he found the real websiteXD
No one is talking about how beautiful she looks? She’s glowing !!!
Those earrings, though.
Did you show Ben the photo of himself? lol.  Bens for sale when you buy two nail oils. lol
Hammer time, BOP BOP ⚒️⚒️😂
lol it wasnt spanish but portuguese. also these companies all suck balls bro.
me: (opens YouTube to search about my assignment) also me: (sees Cristine's newly uploaded vid) *instantly clicks
just to be clear, in Mexico we use “gringo” as a tearm to american people in general, and is not a slur, is not insulting and we don’t use it as that 🤠🤠
The translation doesn’t work because that’s not Spanish 😂
If I ever come along a salon using simplys pictures, I'll go in and make a Karen-worthy scene of how I want my nails painted by simply, because if they use her pictures, that means she must work there, right? 😂
Awww... look at Simply with her hair did. Bless.
I was on her Snapchat story and she said “guess what the video is” and I was very wrong... I said troom troom lol
OMG you are SO PRETTY😍
Is it just me or does Cristine looks A LOT like Jen in the thumbnail??
The bigger problem is, obviously another company is selling those thumbnail shots to the smaller nail salons. I don’t think they know they are stealing your photos. They are buying them cheap from another “business”
At first I was like why is there only 27k likes and then was like ohhhhhhhh it’s 2 hours old
The one of the salon 😂😂😂😂 still with the ?, dip powder nails?, do we do them, maybe, maybe not ❤️
"i can't read spanish" but that's portuguese
Yes Cristine, gringa means white girl
Companies be like “Do YoU hAvE CrUsTy Af FeEt? (Shows picture of cristines feet) MhM loOk At ThOsE cRuStY aSs FeEt” like bitch tf? 😁tehe luv u Cristine😘
putting that crim law degree to good use
Exibity B is is portuguese shgagaha not Spanish
they use your photos  because they have no talent
6:17 " because I can't read spanish" Tat shit is portuguese, Brasil being invibilized again ;-;     For the record, tats a joke jdndndnnd
oh my god i just realized I'm early
gringa is a way to say white lady it may sound mean but trust me it’s not (I know this because I’m Mexican)
Oh honey. LOL Yes its a little mean they are calling you a gringa but its also a term of endearment if it came from a friend. My dad used to call my bfs in high-school gringo instead of calling them by their name.   Also, can we talk about how she dead-@$$ bought a rubber mallet for this video? 😂😂😂🔨🔨🔨
the fact there isnt a water mark in this video😭😭
"I can't speak spanish" cristine nooooooo sweetie that's brazilian portuguese :(
Finally!! 😻 Waited for this video for so long!
Websites like YouTube and Twitch are screwing artists and content creators constantly over bullshit copyright infringement shit (like twitch punishing streamers for literally just,, having game audio or music on during streams) AND there’s fuck all in place to actually protect your own content and I? Damn just can’t win I guess, yikes...
as a portuguese speaker i think gringa means foreign woman  and at least where im from we use it casually, not in a mean way
People have issues
yeah lol i never understood why youtubers make videos out of buying fakes of their stuff because then they're just enabling the companies???
I'd be willing to bet you wouldn't have been able to buy the products, I think nikkietutorials did a similar video and had to have someone else buy her the products because the company knew who she was and declined the orders
SIMPLY COURT  With Judge Cristine
*Portuguese* Cristine: Spanish  *Facepalm*
Is no one gonna talk bout how glowing her skin looks and like damnnn you on fire today (and ever other day!) ✨💖
The channel "How to cook that" as Hollo Chocolate!!! Is it real?
✨Simply Lawyerlogical✨
People love doing this to photographers, so I approve of your sentence!
According to the mexican lore the term "gringo/gringa" originated when there was a feud between Mexico and the US and US soldiers came to Mexico idk why or what for but mexicans used to yell at them "green go!" (Green refering to the soldiers).
I cringed 6:20 omg that isn't even Spanish 😭  I think its Portuguese tho
Cristine, the word "gringa" was not used in a mean way in the context, just so you know ✨
Why don't you just sue them? People doing this kind of stuff is illegal.
I really want simply to try new nail arts. It has been so long I miss it. I wish she would   review other brands nail polish as well have her own brand holo taco.
That wasn’t even Spanish, it is Portuguese.
الجزائر حتى كندا ماخلاوها ف التيقار كلشي سرقوه😂
for the one that mentioned gringas: 1. that’s portuguese (brazilian) 2. its not mean, it translates to “the new craze amongst [north american women]
I bet that are not the salons that get the pictures but the graphic companies that prints the pictures.
Good to see your face back😃
That's not spanish, it's portuguese. Gringa is a slang meaning "girl\woman from other country". They're saying "new fever among girls from other countries". Brazilian always love imported stuff,  "coisas importadas"
The arabic text at 7:34 says: the latest thing nail beauty technology got to💅🏻 it's a printer that draws you any picture you have on your phone 🇩🇿❤️ on your nails for 35 seconds... exclusively and only in Algeria  Click on the picture to go to the official page of this printer
As a Spanish speaker I can comfort that the 2nd definition is correct as I often here my parents say this it is no food
6:30 it's Portuguese. Not Spanish uwu
Thank god cristine uploaded a video. I've been missing her videos too much. 😭❤
I’m never buying ANYTHING from any of these companies! Have some integrity. I can’t believe they even stole footage of Ben’s cuticles.
Hahah when you said you could read Spanish and it was Portugueses you already teased 1 million of your followers 😂😂 Also that's portugueses from Brazil And it says "The new Trend among the American Influencers".  The word gringa is many times used in Brazil as a discriminative word. As that you aren't part of their community, but can also be interpreted as "White American Girl" or Foreigns
Get ur nourished Ben's nails NOW !!! DOWN THE LINK BELOW !
I love that they used the dip powder nails thumbnail even though it's a question. "Dip Powder Nails? Do we have them? We're not sure"
So there's no obligation OF COURSE, but I'm just curious if Cristine would cut 12" off her hair when she gets a haircut like every 5 years to donate....whenever this hell ends lololol
Ben: "Are you hammering smething down here?" Christine: "just companies whose stealing my shxt" Ben: "alright have fun" 🤣🤣🤣
Looks like Someone is getting sued today
The only business simply is going to collaborate with is Roots and The cat charity thing. 🐈🇨🇦
PORTUGUESE NOT SPANISH
In most Spanish countries, 'gringo(a)' means 'white American/white person,' but I have heard that in Brazil they use it to mean 'foreigner'
I hear a lawsuit
Cristine’s hair is hitting me different today
HELL YES! TAKE THE BITCHES TO THE LAW!
The way they kept the question mark on “Dip Powder Nails?” slays me for some reason 😂 Like yeah I don’t know either
Someone looks like they got some sun!!!
Can u do a tortoise shell nail design tutorial?! I’m seeing it all over my Pinterest feed!
This is SIMPLY not okay!
A wise man once said : *"Let's together review our legal options."*
i know it should'nt be grey or green it should be HOLO!!!!!
Why did I think this video was going to be you on the phone to these companies
Great video! Though it's not spanish, it's probably portuguese.
Gringa it's Portuguese and it means foreigners
I thought the thumbnail was a picture of your sister!!
I get you not wanting/having the resources to go after these companies for your private stuff but Holo Taco as a brand should maybe try when it’s a Holo Taco product.
16:32 absolutely loving the fact that cristine’s mug matches her hoodie
alternative title: "Stealing back my Simply Naildentity"
Gringo and gringa is how latin americans call ppl from north america and Europe not of the times, but can be used for anyone outside latin america. In Brazil we call gringo(a) anyone that's not brazilian, even ppl from neighbor countries xD
If you want a haircut get one from Brad Mondo!!!  He wants to collab with you
Not Spanish!!!
Judge simply; we stan
Some of them didn’t even try they just very lazily printed it from a video and use it to advertise 😂
So I work in Fraud and it’s insane how much this happens. We get calls daily about customers getting scammed. The most common one going around is some celebrity face was used on an advertisement for CBD oil on Facebook. Person clicks on it and is taken to a webpage where this company claims they are endorsed by this celebrity and you only need to pay for shipping and handling to try this CBD oil for free. But what they don’t tell you is you’ll be fully charged for that product in 14 days and not only that you’ll be signed up for a reoccurring subscription. The worst part is half the time they don’t even receive a product. It’s crazy to me businesses are allowed to operate and get away with scams like this.
Early uwu💕
this isn’t related but cristine is glowing in this video! i hope your skin is feeling better :(
I love your channel. You always bring me joy when I am feeling down. :)
Get em!
OMG WE GOT A CRISTINE TRYING TO PULL OFF SOME PORTUGAYSSSS I LOVE ITTTT
I kept worrying about her swinging that hammer around and accidentally breaking her nail.
I have a good video idea- You should buy and review nail products that YouTube recommends.  Also, I hope you have a good day and I love you 💕
13:16 the description the company gave with your picture even says "Russian drag marble"...like they stole your pictures and the way you talk about the stuff that's Hella f***king lazy, shame on that scam company
I do wonder for the salons if maybe there's a website that's selling those posters (with Cristine's thumbnails), and the salons are ordering the posters not realizing it was stolen art?
The dislikes are from Amaya's graphic designer
I'm still groggy and misunderstood the title, legitimately thought that they actually stole your nails not the pictures of your nail art.
definition of gringo: A gringo (male) or gringa (female) is someone considered a foreigner from the perspective of Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries in Latin America. Gringo usually refers to a foreigner, especially from the United States or (to a lesser extent) Canada.
Hey Christine that would be “the new trend among people from other countries”  Like here in Brazil where the video is from (and we speak Portuguese) we refer to North Americans as gringos
I saw this one ad use a snipet from your mirror nails video for themselves on Pinterest. NEVER HAVE I EVER HIT THE REPORT BUTTON SO FAST
Hey
Hey! Mexican h💿l💿sexual here! That text was in portuguese lol. But “gringa” is a semi-derogatory term used to describe people from the US. And as far as I know, ur canadian. Its also a type of taco lmao.
7:32 translation:  The latest nail technology and it is a printer that draws for you any picture you have on your phone on your nails during a time of 35 seconds... limited and only in Algeria Click on the photo and the official website for this printer will appear for you
6:18 it isn't spanish, it's actually brazilian portuguese :)
Gringa isn’t a mean word I’d be more offended with the word gabatcha 🙂
"I'm not gonna get my lawyer's involved..." Willing to bet you'll get em involved if they start using the Holo Taco swatches and claim to be selling it. :P
You should make a video of you making PEELY mountain were you find a peal  then put it back on then peal it off again then peal them off then put them on again and just do that over and over again to create PEELY MOUNTAIN!
Portuguese lessons for Cristine!  A nova febre entre as gringas = the hot new trend (literally the "new fever") among white chicks  Portuguese isn't Spanish, but I'm not offended that people who don't speak either can't tell the difference between the two immediately.
Ok, as someone that's from latin america, I feel like I need to clarify that most of use "gringa" when we're talking about someone that's not latine. so it's likely that in that video they're not using it as an insult, but as like "this is what people are using outside of latin america".
fyi at 6:10 thats not spanish n.n
Crintine: I can't read Spanish Me: *spanish native* Wait did I forgot how to read in my native language.
Good for you, Cristine~! Well done all of you fans who caught these 'crooks' in the act!
Ok but "i can't read Spanish" No no no no....it's portuguese😔🇧🇷
a gringa confusa com as giria kk assim q é bom, continua achando q nois fala spanish bb
AS YOU SHOULD
order on the internet....lolololol
Not to mention a lot of the time with these ads, the product doesn't even exist and they'll take your money and either do a runner or you'll receive some terrible cheap product that isn't as described and still do a runner anyway so you can't report them to trading standards or who ever. So just don't buy from these scam artists in the first place! Same goes for those t-shirt ads I see on my facebook, they all have really nice designs but when you do a reverse image search, half the time it's stolen from someone else.
6:05 Is not Spanish is Portuguese, it's saying poligel nails are trending between foreigners, and that they are now available in Brazil
Gringo is a slang term to refer to united states citizens. It comes from when USA soldiers were invading mexico, they had a green uniform. So mexicans said GREEN GO, for them to leave. Im from Mexico 👋🏼 it popularized to refer as americans as gringos or gringas, it is not offensive. It started off in Mexico but spread to latin america.
If it was for the pandemic, I would love for you to go a Nail salón and ask for the hardest design and then trying to copy at home.
In regards to the real life nail salons, I used to work as a graphic designer, and clients were ALWAYS asking me to do shady stuff like this, I always refused, but it's amazing how many people just assume it's ok to just take the photos and layout from someone else and put their name on it with no other changes. It's one of the many reasons I don't do that kind of work anymore.
I wish you had a real judge mallet. I have always wanted one. Don’t know why.
Why YouTube has only 1 like here???? 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Come on guys! Give her a break, spanish and portuguese are really similar, and actually, the word “gringa” is from México, a spanish speaking country. So, she can be educated, smart, and still mistake spanish with portuguese, no big deal, really.  And BTW, If you are using “gringa” for all foreigners, you are using it wrong, it is exclusively for people from USA.
6:19 IS NOT SPANISH CRISTINE
Christine you’re so pure. If someone on the Internet stole pictures of your feet, the last thing they would do is use them to sell socks 🙈
6:18 That's portuguese, brazilian portuguese I assume. It says "now in Brazil" (agora no brasil)
You would think Instagram would do a better job at screening who they allow sponsored ads for. The first and only time I ever order something off an insta ad (it was a stupid backpack) I ended up contesting the payment with my bank and getting my money back because I never received my product and wasn’t able to contact the seller.
People who do this are absolute garbage. Don't steal from people. It's absolutely wrong.
I would’ve sentenced them to death
Cristine: "I can´t read Spanish." Brazilian Portuguese: ...🙃  And what the video was saying was basically "The hottest new trend amongst foreign women, now available in Brazil" so nothing related to colour or race, I´m guessing it's mostly referring to North American and native English speaking women since that's what the word "gringa(s)" is mostly used for as far as I know. (I say as far as I know because I'm Portuguese but grew up, and am still to this day surrounded by Brazilians, their media and culture and so it's pretty much embedded in me somewhere deep 😅). They only used your face and voice saying "Oh my God!" as cast for the role of "Gringa" because that's the most North American-sounding/English-speaker thing to say to us non-Americans and non-native English speakers, very stereotypical I know 🙈  Anywho, still sucks they did this but well done for landing the role of "Gringa" without even auditioning, that's some talent right there! 😂
IT IS NOT SPANISH IT IS PORTUGUESE!
you gunna start selling those holo taco stickers cristine? 👀👀👀👀
I'm fairly certain that the companies that printed off your thumbnails for their stores just used Google to find nail images and your thumbnails popped up lol  (I'm not defending these stores, it's kinda stupid what they did, they should just make their own nails and take pictures of those. I'm just pretty sure that this is what a lot of these salons did lol)
I think Cristine should use Watermark every whereeeeee in the video so that people can't steal  God I Am soooo intelligent haha!! 😂😂
Yea basically Gringa means white girl can confirm cause my dad and mom use it sometimes
I thought that was jen in the thumbnail haha
I need Cristine to record a “You bitches can’t even spell Prague” video since her hair is so long
I need that Holo Taco mallet!!! 💿📀📀💿💿📀
6:20 Cristine: i can't read spanish Me, a spaniard: excuse me what XDDDD  Edit: omg even google translate said it's not I'm dying XDDDD Also, we all know that HoloTaco sticker is coming soon 👀👀👀
That's not Spanish cristine, we speak portuguese in brazil!!!
Your hair looks so shiney and healthy! I just love it 😍🥰❤️
6:19... Should we tell her that's portuguese ?
OMG I just got a Holo Taco ad on this video!  Best YouTube ad I've ever had
Do u have an ad for holo taco bc I saw one
7:35 I think it says “the latest in nail beautification technology. It will draw any picture you have on your phone in 35 seconds. Available exclusively in Algeria. (Or at a nail salon called the islands? ).... exclusively lol😂
7:28 exhibit c The last thing nail tech has reached. Its a printer that prints on ur nails whatever photo u have from ur phone in 35 seconds  Exclusive and only in Algeria (LMAO) (I have no clue what the line on top of the pictures say)  Arabic is my mother tongue and I just had to help my favorite nail girl out there love u Cristine ❤
7:29 was is arabic so here is your translation: The latest nail polish technology. A printer that prints any picture from your phone on your nails in 35 seconds. Exclusive to Algeria.
Irdk how to feel about the fact that you recognizes Ben's cuticles
Cristine being serious honestly scares me Companies you better watch out
Are you going to take legal action?
Yep it means "the new hottest trend amongst white girls"!
What’s your sentencing for her”  “ELECTRIC CHAIR”
At 7:32 they were saying: " the latest nail beauty technology, it's a printer that draws any picture in your phone on your nail in 35 seconds, it's available only in Algeria"  Basically they are trying to sell the nail printer and just used your face as advertisement
I just saw a nail shop with cutepolish's thumbnail and i think she didnt give them permission to use her photo
I assume we are going to see a Nailopolis Inc video coming out soon? I mean, you want to support and promote the people that help run your business, right?
My favorite part is that those nail salons kept the ? After the dip powder nails  Dip powered nails?
If I was her I probably would sue those companies asses off😂
OKAY NOW AS A BRAZILIAN, I have to say, it's portuguese. not spanish. I know it's very similar, tho.
Just to clarify, gringo or gringa is a Mexican term that we use to refer Americans, the story behind this word goes back to when the Americans and Mexicans went into war, the Mexicans soldiers used to yell at the Americans “green go home!” bc their uniforms were green, and the word just stayed, it’s not really offensive, mostly depends on the context 🤷🏻‍♀️
To all the Brazilians saddened that Cristine didn't recognize that you speak Portuguese and not Spanish, I'm so sorry too for being ignorant. And thank you for all your comments that are educating us Simply fam on how to be more culturally competent people in the future. Thank you for correcting us, even though it should not be your job to do so. Our Western educational systems need to do better. Fun fact: My 11th grade history teacher literally spent so long making us learn the U.S. states by heart that we ran out of time to learn THE ENTIRE REST OF THE WORLD. There is a reason I miss all the geography questions on Jeopardy...
Your hair looks good today
Does Ben ever just get bored and sit down and braid her hair?  Because my roommate in college had hair like hers and I did that all the time when I wanted a study break.
here in brazil, gringa is anyone that is not from our country,  aka. foreigner/gringo. we say that a lot in makeup review like "essa paleta parece muito com as das gringas" which is something like "this palette is like those from overseas" i think you understand what i mean, it to compare quality of the formula, specially when you live in a country that dupes a lot of US products
It has been ages since I watched Cristine's videos...... Why did she suddenly look so young?
Cristine: Companies should be ethical in their business practices.  Capitalism: Yeah, we don't do that here.
You look extra pretty in this video. Is it your hair? Your skin? 😍
yesterday, i got some holo taco fro my birthday, and i was so happy i almost cried lol also, I found this out recently, but my best friend's older sister was in one of Cristine's videos!! (her name is elise)
Around 6:30minutes: its not spanish, babe. Portuguese. Brazilian portuguese. 🇧🇷 gringa: woman from other country.
Ben never brings the tea anymore!
Hiii! I'm from Brazil! "GRINGA" its a foreign  person. It's like someone from Canadá would say: This Brazilian person needs a ride.  OBS: great pronounce!!
The bit with the picture of Ben in it was just 😂 !!! Not cool ( stealing) but 😂
Simply your nails are getting pretty long, please be careful, we don't want a tragedy to happen
cristine: I can't read spanish the ad: In portuguese
i think cristenes video intro uses the same audio as the intro to come dine with me
dang, even brazilian companies are involved
Honestly I want Cristene to buy some of these products and compare them or just *see how they actually operate*  20 seconds later: Oh yea okay that’s reasonable
7:28 in case you were curious basically just says it’s a new manicure technology that prints it on your nails in 30 seconds or something. I’m not 100% sure, so correct me if I’m wrong.
the video at 6:00 isn't in spanish, but in portuguese.Brazilian portuguese to be exact
cristine: I can't read spanish every brazilian: *oh no*
Grigio or gringo is a foreign person... it just means you’re from a different country
The fact that she doesn't use airpods makes me feel a little less broke. 😭😂😭😂😭 Also makes her a little more relatable.
"Because I can't speak Spanish". Me, as a fellow PORTUGUESE citizen... We are always forgotten :/ ahaha love you simply! also how is your eye rash?
I have to say that live in Mexico and actually in some place some kind of tacos are called gringas
Was that a “binders of women” reference?! 😂
🤩
Stealing & printing out YouTube thumbnails as posters are a whole new level of theft!
imagine if she actually uses this video in court
I can't believe Cristine hasn't been watermarking her videos this whole year and I never even noticed!
Not SPANISH! It’s portugueseeeee!
Pls watch more troom troom
Someone:Uses Cristines Footage Cristine:Execute Order 66
Did you do something to your hair? It's looking really good
I want misce-nail-eous holo taco
Now i hope that christine creates her own nail oil 😯😯 that will be the best
Hey Christine, I don’t know how familiar you are with Bath and Body Works but like years ago I bought a hand sanitizer that said “HOLO it’s me” on it and I just found it and realized you probably didn’t endorse it👀 I’m not sure if you’ve got that phrase trademarked but Bath and Body works is definitely sus and obviously stole from you
That’s not Spanish
You should contact Pinterest. They delete copy right and intellectual property pins from being shared and claimed
I love that Ben came in to check on you! So sweet!
Cris giving evidence like we don't have her videos committed to memory 😏
"a nova febre entre as gringas" Brasil 🇧🇷 marcou presença ali 😂😂
OK BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW GOOD CRIS’ HAIR LOOKS LIKE
That wasn’t even spanish tho 🤣🤣 I’m dying 😭🤣
I just finished my first semester of law school and this video is a little traumatic to me lmao BUT GET EM CRISTINE
you should start selling simplysocks
SHAME! we support you and only Cristine!!!
WE BETTER SEND THEM TO SIMPLYCOURT!
that's portuguese not spanish lol
Yes Cristine gringa means white girl
The office theme song was playing on my tv and she started hitting that mallet thing to the beat of the song 😂😂😂
i'm brazilian and i'm very amused that they used your face for that lol also yeah "a nova febre entre as gringas" means like "the new trend among gringas" or something like that and nope "gringa" isn't necessarily mean, i think they just referred to you like that because some people here have an inferiority complex and trust gringos' opinions better lmao
Hola
Some German YouTubers once cooked Doner, that tumbnail is now on a restaurant.
At 17:42 the words Written in Arabic means: the latest technology for manicure, which is a printer that printe you any picture you have on the phone to your nails in a period of 35 seconds exclusively and only in (name of a country   ,don't want to mention so I don't  get  in trouble) The rest even I didn't understand
Gringa is a way to call an American,  and its also a food name. As how I see it, many Mexicans call Americans, gringos as a joke, or just a second name for American, I'm not sure if other ppl in latin america say the same thing cuz I'm only mexican, ;-; but its not said in a offensive way, just like a small joke
Ben needs to buy Cristine a gavel for Christmas so she doesn’t have to use a mallet lol
When you show your nails and the finished product put the watermark over your fingers so they can’t crop it
Cristine it aint spanish!!!! its portuguese :C at 6:14 and i cry :c
I like how i came from the vid where you said you might call them out lol
It has been a min since I watch her videos and I still love them
Like how y’all not pointing out how awesome her hairs looks 😻
The clip in 6:00 is not in spanish  ITS PORTUGUESE AAAAAAAAA
I lost it when they showed Ben's nails!
Oh my gosh, I sent you the Aliexpress one couple years ago in insta 😄 didn't buy those decals from the stealers btw
As an artist, thank you so much for pointing out that companies need to hire and pay us as well! I think a lot of folks forget that it takes a paid artist to get good advertisements made because we're so focused on the "starving artist" bullshit.
BTW Christine, Exhibit C at 7:28 roughly says: "The latest arrivals in nail art technology; a printer that prints any picture that you have on your phone onto your nails in 35 seconds... exclusively and only available in Algeria. Click to visit the official site for this printer."  In conclusion, more marketing bs ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ smh how disappointing.  (sorry for any mistakes, 2nd gen Arab lol~~)
The one with the Spanish nail things idk the gringa one they also stole another persons video and it’s literally in my yt stories
amy santiago vibes
So I know that’s not Spanish.  It’s probably Portuguese which I only know a bit of.  And it says “A new trend with the foreigners”.  Sooooo.  Edit:  Should have waited before commenting cause she literally googled it 5 seconds later.
Hi
poor cristen had to go to the GOVERNMENT because of how bad people can really be. i’m so sorry cristen :(
it's portuguese not spanish
Is it just me, or did Cristine's eyes become better now? I hope you are healing ❤️
7:28 is in arabic and it talks about the nail art machine and how it can print any picture on you nails
So at minute 07:28 its arabic and says The latest technology for nail beauty, print photos on you phone into your nails in 35 seconds - only in Algeria Click on it to be directed to the page
What a shame. I cant stand thieves and liars.
6:19  That isn't spanish, i'm from Spain :) idk what language is the one of the add ❤️
Finally, new Ace Attorney trail
Your hair looks great🔥🔥
"can't read spanish" *shows portuguese text*
I love the fresh, price tag still attached rubber mallet
Ann Reardon did a video making safe to eat Holo chocolate!
SIMPLY!! THATS PORTUGUESE NOT SPANISH!! As someone who speaks Spanish, “Gringa” means “cracker”.
When she said "I can't read spanish" 💀
It's awful they use your nails and image without permission.   PS. The "gringa" ad was in Portuguese and you got the meaning of "gringa" right. In México is not a very nice word to use but depending on the context it can be mean or not. In this case it wasn't mean
I'm laughing because the ad she's translating it's in portuguese not spanish hahahahaha so the translstt was probably very wrong
Gringo means someone from USA, at Latin America is sometimes used for everyone that speak English (When is unknown where the person its from). Gringa is the female and also a quesadilla type. And yes, a lot of people use it as a pejorative but not everybody
In spanish my family uses gringo/a when we talking about white people 😅
its funny how you say among
People get offended by everything nowadays, im currently learning spanish, but it took me a while to realize that ad was in Portuguese, especially with the word gringa in there, i just thought these were some spanish words i haven't learnt or something, i didn't even pay attention to the fact that it was from Brazil. For anyone who doesn't know either language it's hard to see the difference, so calm down and stop judging.
portuguese is not spanish lol just saying
I like to get a Ben lmfao. What’s that site, I need it lmao.  I need a dad to keep me in check lmfao
I'm sorry simply you're really nice person to do that but if I saw that specific one with the five different nails I would literally have them do all five of those nails Tell them they suck at them and tell them not to steal images off of the internet take photos of the actual art that you have done you know so your customers know what they're in for but you know whatever I'm not going to be nice I'm glad you are though simply I would not be nice to these people I wouldn't be this nice
I’ve “Ben” waiting for them to start stealing Ben’s nails! 😂🙈🍌
Why cristine dont have a HOLO MUG . Ugghhhh😬
hope you dont mind me eating bagels while we are sitting on this jury cause I need lunch
The real tea
I feel like I’m kinda early but not really umm hi ilysm
0:34 hue hue BR É Brasil! Mas sinto zero orgulho.  Edit: 6:19 it's not Spanish! It's brazilian Portuguese. ;)
Cristine, I don't think that add is in spanish, is portuguese
no t no shade, that was not spanish but portuguese lol
6:45 baby they callin you a white girl 😭
*gets ad for Facebook shops*
your hammer has your companys logo on it? thats sick
Gringa can be an insult but also a compliment, it depends on the context.
Add in Portuguese:  Cristine: I can't read Spanish
In addition, when the company refers to "The new fever among gringo", it means something good. Because in our countries, new international products take a long time to get here, so he wants to say something like: Look at this incredible product that previously only existed in the United States, now you also have the chance to use it!
I haven’t watched the video yet but I’m so sad a company took her bag of nail peelies
We call "gringo/gringa" foreign people, usually english speakers. It's kinda funny, but not mean.
I never thought I would see Cristine talking about Brazil, much less in these circumstances. But taking advantage of the momentum please add Brazil in holo taco!!!!
Cristine, you look different. You have gotten fat. And its a good thing. I always worried when your face look so skinny.  Disclaimer: Putting on weight is good. Nothing to be shame of it. If you are the type of people who shame others for putting on weight. Then dont even bother to talk n say mean words to them, just for you to feel better. Its NOT good putting others down for you to feel "superior", in which u aren't
Cristine that was português and gringa means like people from outside  Brasil
she protecc she attacc but most importantly her hammer go whacc
Video you thought was in Spanish is actually in Portuguese
Grigo/a means like your really  white but in spanish
That’s not Spanish... that’s Portuguese... hate them stealing your footage 😤
Wooow, I've never seen you wearing earrings before. Or did I just not see them before O.O
6:20 oof.... that was Brazilian Portuguese.. it’s pretty similar though
I wanted to see ben see his face and his nails stolen lmfao
I found you on Snapchat and decided to check out your channel  Btw your workout routine is impressive!
🤣
A lá, a gringaiada descobrindo que é gringa.
Now I’m going to be creating a water mark
could you put holo powder over chrome mirror?
What was the music at 4:24 ? I forgot the name but I heard it before
7:31 The Arabic text says "The latest technology for beautifying your nails has arrived. And it’s a printer that can draw any of the pictures on your phone onto your nails in under 35 seconds… Only available in Algeria. To get to the official page for the printer, click on the photo”
You should make a channel called simplyexposed and expose more people who steal your content
#eattherude
Dang, I'm so used to Cristine having semi messy or put up hair. Her hair right now is so straight
simply..... that's portuguese, not spanish.
Not them calling u a grinGa LMAO
Lol “I can’t read Spanish”
Calling out all the companies I can for stealing content and linking Cristine videos
"agora no BRASIL" Cristine: I can't read Spanish 💁🏻‍♀️
i just wanted to say the language around the 6:30 mark wasn't spanish, it was portuguese common misconception lol
That's so ridiculous! I'm glad people are calling that out when they see it.
the last time i was this early Christine was still doing mail art
“I cant read Spanish”  me knowing it’s Portuguese 👁👄👁
as a brazilian i can explain that a “gringa” is any foreign (not brazilian) girl, mostly the non latinas. it is not necessarily a mean thing
When she searched gringas LMAO
Gosh i love her! 😂😍
I worry for her table, someone get Cristine an actual gavel, ASAP 🤣
“I can’t read spanish” Sorry Cris, that was portuguese 🤣🤣🤣
Only video without Ben??? No!
I wasn’t expecting the hammer at the start lol
14:35 🤣🤣🤣 I would love to see Ben's reaction!
I WANT THAT HOLO TACO STICKER!!! Want a sheet of them!! Let’s goooooo 🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈
It's not spanish,it's portuguese and says "the new fever between foreigns"
no one: cristine: wait so they have my nails, my face, AND MY VOI- youtube: hold on let me just give you three ads you cant skip 😌
Is that a rubber mallet
7:20 it means it is a trend for girls that are not from Brazil. :) (In Brazil they think that everything you can import from other country is the best product, I know it's stupid)
I feel so cringy by being Brazilian now lol yes, "gringa" mean foreigner girl and it's not mean or bad. We consider things from outside better than national
cristineeee u look so beautiful look at that hair SHINE
i love how she used a whole sledge hammer instead of a gavel
The Arabic one says : the latest technology for nail art and it's a printer that prints on your nails any picture you have on your phone in 35 sec and it's exclusively in Algeria
SPANISH??????? CRISTINE THATS PORTUGUESE  IT SAYS BRASIL IN THE BEGINNING!!!!!  kinda offended, but what could I expect
She said- lawsuit 💅✨
i can’t believe they called you gringa JAJAJAJA
Hi there. The second one is in Portuguese, not spanish. ;)
Cristine translateing portugues as spanish lol
Hahahahah "gringa" is NOT a bad thing! It's just a slang for non Latin Americans, it can even be used as a sweet nickname for foreigners! Plus, that was portuguese, it said Brazil, Christine! Hahahaah it translates to " the hottest trend among foreigners" "buy now on sale for free shipping"
"Gringa" is the feminine word for "Gringo". It means foreignes here in Brazil. It's not offensive, it's just a way to say "This person doesn't leave in Brazil" And also, is portuguese The ad says "The foreignes love it"
I mean....                ...she s famous...
why is cristine kind of glowing tho... like can i pls look this good without makeup 😤😤
Tô amando a quantidade de brasileiros nos comentários! 🇧🇷🇧🇷❤❤💅🏻💅🏻
That table must have been broken because of your hammering 😂😂😂
I just want to say that I enjoy the organization of the nail polishes in the back a lot better!!!
6:11 is not Spanish but Portuguese more exactly Brazilian Portuguese. Basically they are saying that that product was treding amoung "gringos" (western countries, specifically richer countries, in this case maybe reference to Americans) is now available in Brazil and you can buy. In short was this
Cristine, you need to know. Ann Readon from How to Cook that invented ACTUAL Holo chocolate, 100% edible.
Cristine that was not Spanish, that's portuguese, and that's from Brasil
That laugh in the end just made my day❤️
The companies right now: 💧👁👄👁
I like her take on this video idea. Some people will throw shade but she's just having fun
me being named Amaya and hearing it come out of her mouth: :O
Her hair looks so pretty in this video!!
The subscription button should turn holo when you subscribe
Cristine that’s not Spanish it’s portuguese!! Hahaha
Omg you are so hilarious!!
Holo Cristine
Oh my God, I thought she was going to call these people and ask them "wHaT ThE HEaCk?" 😅🤦
I am DYING at them using images of Ben and his nails xD
Cristine that is not spanish is portuguese!!!
7:10 its not spanish its portuguese, but gringos is basically what people here in latin america call all north american english-speaking people. Can be mean in certain contexts but im p sure here it was used as just "People from the USA"
The fact that you are using a rubber mallet for a gavel really makes me laugh.
I always report adds that aren't from you with your nails in them as scams and misleading.
Omg i have huge neopets flashbacks from the soundtrack in the first few seconds
Your hair looks nice! That's a really good style for you :)
Oh my god, the fact that nailpolish rackd are back to its nice order, it is wayyy more relaxing and easy to watch these videos hahah
i feel like you’d LOVE emily d. baker  **edit: THE BADASS LAWYER AND LEGAL COMMENTATOR, HOST OF THE GET LEGIT LAW AND SHIT PODCAST, QUEEN OF FACTS NOT FUCKERY
I’ve also seen your dip powder thumbnail at a local nail salon hahah
Christine: "I can't read Spanish" Me: That add was in Portuguese, no?
Cristine you could actually make a few million dollars if you were to actually take these all to court 👀
The reason why it doesnt turn green is because grey means your LOCKED IN BITCH
Go chrome or go home! New line for simply if its not already
Cristiiiiine, thé second video its not spanish, its Portuguese from brazil! And we wach you here too ❤️ sorry for thé stolen fotage :(
Exhibit C is in Arabic and it says: “The latest nail beauty technology have come up to this nail art printer which can print any picture from your phone on your nails in 35 seconds..only available in Algeria” 😆👌🏽
They know you can't sue them because most of these companies are foreign and suing a foreign company is a giant pain in the ass unless you have a lot of money and time. Like Nintendo.
YOu should go to these salons and request the nail art or service that they offer using your content! I think that would make a funny video, though I know you don't like going to salons and especially bc its covid times...
lowkey thought the thumbnail was jen
"they're shady and they know it" 😂
Why does her hair look good? Simply, what have you done to that horse mane??
6:33 it was Portuguese or Brazilian Portuguese 😊
Hey Simply! I think I am speaking for all us when I say this. The second i saw the Nail oil I thought, she or i needs to try that. Could we get Simply or another nail channel to try that "Nail oil" out? They probally watched the video and made tons of it and are now selling it! CRAZY! BUT, I still think somebody needs to try that "nail oil"
Does anyone else have issues with the video freezing at spots but audio still plays...?
cristine: "i cant read spanish" thats portuguese, and "gringas" means basically people who are not from Brazil, and so is that account (i dont know the account, but thats brazilian portuguese)
6:24 that's not Spanish- that's Portuguese- Why people confuse both?
Cristine your hair looks amazing today xx like if u agree with me xx❤️😍😘
not cristine be slyly moving towards ✨turquoise × holo✨ aesthetic (also hair glow up!😍)  more love to you girl ❤️❤️ (here since 2017)
I searched up Nail art and your videos came up hahahahahahah 😂😂😂😂
So... The word "gringo" comes from the war between Mexico and US. Mexican used to tell US soldiers "green go home". That eventually became "green go" and then "gringo". In most parts of Latam you use it to refer to a US citizen or maybe to europeans (for example, people sometimes refer to germans as gringos too). But in Brazil (I just learned this lol) is used to name any foreign.  It can be used in an offensive way, but most of the time is just like a nickname.
Cristine: I have no idea what they are saying, I don’t read Spanish    Brazilian/Portuguese people: Oooohhhh nooo... my heart 😭😭
I have a great idea after the pandemic go to nail salon and ask them to recreate one of your nail arts “a hard one” it would be fun
I need simplycourt merch now
Some of these companies will just block you from commenting if you call them out on their shit. I've been blocked by multiple for calling them out and posting a link of the original source ^_^
it feels like years between each simply video
Ben creeping in the background in that ad I just- 😂😂😂
I dislike this (the fact people stealing from you)  I would like to state though, that Sally Hanson had metallic polish and it was the first out there.
I love her natural look 😍
Grigo means foreign. Just that
Cristine excitedly yelling “THOSE ARE BEYN’S CUTICLES” is so damn cute.
It's portuguese, not Spanish! 6:04 "The new "fever" (trend) with the Foreigner women, now in Brazil" "Poligel alongation that can be dome at home" "it promices long and resistent nail for up to 20 days" "buy your kit now with free shipping, and get a UV light station"
i love this version of content court
girl, I love you, but that's portuguese, not spanish (cries in brazilian). Also, "gringo" or "gringa" is just a word we use for foreigners, and it's not really an insult or mean, it's more of a cheeky way of poking fun at clueless tourists, and many of them start using the word to refer to themselves once they've become more familiar with our country
The nail pen is the craziest one! Wow!
u need to put ur watermark on ur middle finger or something😩like actually on the nail. just a big SNL right on there with some holo or some shit
6:18 jajajajaj that isn’t Spanish baby
Well Zayn Malik's hair style is in every barber shop  in the Philippines😂 thats stealing too i guess😂
Maybe someone is selling HD Simply Nailogical YT thumbnail posters for salons. You should list the actual products you used so people can buy the correct products.
Isn't Spanish was Brazilian Portuguese, and was saying "new product makes success with the foreign girls"
Em nome do Brasil gostaria de dizer que aqui não é todo mundo mau caráter (por mais que possa parecer) e inclusive recomendo a Cristine que meta o processinho em quem roubar o conteúdo dela pra fazer propaganda enganosa 😍  You go and sue them all girl, they're stealing your content for profit
Around Halloween, a company was selling giant angel wings. My city's cosplay community noticed immediately that their photos/videos were from one of our cosplayer's work. They hadn't reached out or anything, just stole her amazing work. We were all furious.
lol yes that does say "The new hottest trends among white girls"
I wish you sue them and get all their money 😩
Well that’s Portuguese, not Spanish lol. Kinda kills me that google even told her, and she didn’t correct herself. But honestly, whatever. I am curious if Gringa is used the same way in Portuguese as it is in Spanish, though.
Sue them!!
"you're gonna sell some socks?" Cristine, please, I think human trafficking and sale is a little different than breaking Trademark and Copyright laws
6:15 thats not Spanish
Something about your face cam video looks especially nice today.
Still more evidence than Rudy Giuliani has. 💅
electric chair *smack
Well guys, clearly if she can't read Portuguese, she can't tell that is is Portuguese!!
Don't feel bad for "shaming" them, this just is theyr Karma. Sure it isnt an awful crime like murder, but it still isnt right.
Have photo watermarks that slide across the screen constantly I do that for my dog videos
Exhibit B is not Spanish is Portuguese hahaha is that holotaco hammer coming out soon?😂🙌🏼
So what happens when they use them and you find out? Do you take legal actions?
that's not spanish lol it's portuguese
Cristine naturally looks so good here, and her hairrr💕😩
Hey Cristine u are so funny
who else wants cristine tries the products??? (for content only.. not supporting them) just me??? ok.
Offended you said you can't read Spanish when in fact it was Portuguese :(
cristine uploading a video on my birthday made my day ^u^
2:15 that's what she said
simply, thats not a gavel thats a fucking sledgehammer
Simply court,Nail-dentity 🤣🤣🤣
Grigo means wight boy Gringa mans wight girl
Those dislikes might be the shop owners that used her thumbnail and video for ads :P
i've missed you simply!!!!!!!!!!!
It works if you buy copyrights/trademarks  in that country depending on what country it's in and their copyright laws, by setting up a company or business in that country assuming you're able to.
Lmao you have a holo army all over the world. 😆
~All I want for Christmas is every single product found in Holo Taco!!! ~Make my wish come trueee.....(by allowing me to order your products and ship them to Latvia cause I live there) ~CAUSE BABY ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS SIMPLY'S HOLOOOOOOOOOOOO . . . . It's been 1 years, 4 months, 3 days - and still I can not order HoloTaco because I live in Latvia. If I could order, I would order E V E R Y single thing in Holo Taco. Simply!! I beg of you, make my dreams come true and make it possible for me to order your products so that they can be shipped to Latvia!
7:30 TRANSLATION (word for word) "The latest manicure technology 💅 and it's a printer that draws any picture you have on your phone 🇩🇿❤ on your nails in 35 seconds ... Exclusively and only in Algeria  Click on the photo to go to the official page for this printer subscribe"
Crochet groups that I am a part of in Facebook have used watermarks on their pictures that they post. I am not sure how to do the watermarks but it would be hard for anyone to use your footage with the way they do theirs.  It's actually on the item itself.    What I did for a "Mandala Madness" blanket that I made was uses a piece of paper with my name on it. I put this paper on my blanket for the pictures. It's an 18 part blanket that was a crochet along project. Each week we were given the new part on the group page.   I love your videos & enjoy your products. Thank you for sharing with everyone.
Drop that ban hammer!
cristine!!!! its portuguese not spanish, btw it still sucks that they used your face, and the gringa slang is not mean, its just a different way to say foreign
You should at least take legal action on the stolen Holo Taco products!!
11:43 that's not a bad idea. Go to a salon and ask them to recreate one of your past nail arts.
these people would do better if they looked up “nail oil being applied” on google and used a random video  (now obviously we don’t want that either companies please make your own pictures and videos thank you)
Turn that subscribe button green   Wait no not green it’s grey lol
They wanna sell Ben? Without Christin permition?? HOW DO SE KILLING?
os BR tudo explicando kkkkkkk fofos
1. the AUDACITY of these people not even removing watermarks from pictures or videos, damn  2. you look BEAUTIFUL and your hair looks amazing 😭💕
Your hair is gloriousssss in this video 😍👏
make your background your black background every thing in your house every thing in your frame every where watermarked 🤣😂 this will be fun next video
6:24 That's not Spanish, Cristine, that's Portuguese, so probably that company stealing your stuff is Brazilian. Shame on them.
Is it bad that I wanted to see Ben’s reaction to having his cuticles stolen and seeing his photo used? I wish there was an easy way to stop companies from using influencer content. But since there isn’t, I will just continue to give my business to legit companies (including Holo Taco, which is my fav nail polish supplier).
btw "gringas" wasn't mean in that case, but the word can be used in this way too
Love this video. An look so good. Loved how u wearing your long hair
Wow your hair looks soooo pretty !!!
SHE IS MY HERO!!!! she took this so calm and collected and she inspires so many people THANK YOU 😊
at 8:00 proof that Cristine's skin has had enough and won't let her play with makeup anymore.
Cristine is ALWAYS beautiful, but today...QUEEN!! You are on TOP TODAY! ❤️❤️
"A nova febre entre as gringas" basically means "The hottest trend between foreigners"  At least here in Brazil, we don't use it as a mean word
Why do i hear prostitute everyone someone says prosecute
THAT'S NOT SPANISH, CRISTINE!!! THAT IS PORTUGUESE😫😫😫 you trying to speak Portuguese was so cute tho
Christine you look so beautiful 😍 💖   Strong and confident!
Someone should make her one of those hammer things that they is in court (forgot the name) but they should make it holo or something
@11:45 Hello this is chef John from foodwishes.com
that gringa ad wasnt spanish its portuguese lol
I loved this video. Your hair looks amazing btw!
Gringa/Gringo basically means foreigner in Brazil, is not really offensive
#Simplynaildentity
She is so beautiful! 😍😘❤
SimplyJudgeLogical
6:18  "Because I can't read spanish" Brazilian people: hol' up
Damn- Can we talk about how she’s making quarantine better?
That's... not... spanish...
1:53 all the snap peeps know how hard that was 😭
Gringo/gringa/gringos/gringas is actually a way of referring to North Americans. It has no malicious overtones and its origins stem from the phrase "greens, go!" used in wars
So the poly gel face one... that’s definitely Portuguese and even said BRASIL at the bottom.... 😭💔
"I can't read spanish" the writing in portuguese 👁️👄👁️
WTF? A BRAZILIAN AD 6:22 ??? '-' (it isn't spanish, it's portuguese)
Cristine: 6:18 I can’t read Spanish Me, a Spanish speaker, not being able to read it either cause it’s in Portuguese 👁👄👁
Omg gurl calling you a "gringa" is not mean, it's used to talk about people that are (usually) Americans.
It's funny to see you trying to figure out what "gringa" means xd hahah I'm mexican and indeed it is a type of taco(? Ish and also to refer to US citizens
Oh if I walked into a real Nail Salon establishment and saw your content I would lose my S*it and scream at them and tell them they are breaking the law and are thieves and I would make sure all their customers heard it.
As a Tica (person from Costa Rica) we call gringos/gringas to those who are from the united states usually. Its just easier than saying Estadounidense. We may use it to make fun of how gringos usually dont know how things work around here, but not any bad offenses.
you should make them sign adoption papers for a clip of your vids lol
I love this. ✨👩🏻‍⚖️💅🏻🤣
Side note: I love that your mug matches your hoodie
once I saw your thumbnail tapped on the front of some random nail place 😭 it was wild
I bet the dislikes are the companys that do that
You don’t want to be called a gringa! Or gringo!
Gringa is a way to refer to people of the us bc we hate how they call themselves "Americans" is not always despective but in the phrase they are not talking about you sweetheart💜💙
i thought companies ACTUALLY stole your nails . . .
Is it me or does Cristine look way younger? like she look's like she's in her mid 20
7:33 that is Arabic and it says “The latest thing that nail polish technology achieved, A printer that print any nail polish design that you would ever want in 35 seconds.. exclusively in Algeria”
the audacity
plz tell how your hair are so long i also want that much length hair
Im from argentina i didnt see that. Omg....
What the ✨Fawk✨ hahaha I love this.
All the dislikes are from the companies who use her photos.
0:02 in holo we trust as an american i laughed so hard at that
Love the mallot.
When you looked up what Gringa was I literally died in laughter... 😂
No nooo Cristine... It's portuguese, not spanish. All our love from Brasil, anyways 🇧🇷
Her mug matches her sweater!!!
My favorite part about the dip powder thumbnail is the “?”
Your hair looks so healthy. Is so soothing weirdly lol
Isn’t Spanish Christine 😭😭😭 is Portuguese
I was just wondering if Ben was like wtf is Cristine doing?!?!
My name is Amaya how dare they 😅😄😄
What if David’s tea used her face for people who like their tea 🧐
You are a huge nail channel people will steal your nails and face. they are stealing other small creators images and videos too and they would put their own water mark on it. It happened to me so many times. Specially indian channels are doing that
Cristine, that's portuguese
Please try out spider gel. I know you would enjoy playing with that so much.
We saw office Cristine today!!!      Beautiful hairs❤️
That’s not Spanish, it’s portuguese!
Claim your here before 100, 000 views here
Omg cristiiiiiine that's not Spanish that's Portugueseeeee 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
My boyfriend is Mexican and he has told me multiple times that gringo and gringas was a slur
Nikkie Tutorials has this same problem with shady makeup companies.  Said thing is people are wasting their money on shitty product, and I'm sure some of them teenagers that don't usually have money to throw away on crap. Makes me sick that they can get away with this, especially if they're an overseas "company"😡  No worries, your SimplyInvestigators will stay on the case!😊
The binders reference 😂
When I go to court I have affidavits *holds a box of nail polish*
OMG I REMEMBER WHEN SHE WAS ASKING ON TWITTER FOR EXAMPLES. I remember sending her a video on Facebook using her literal whole video and saying it was their product.
I took Spanish for five years, so when Cristine said "I can't read Spanish." I was like, that's not Spanish, right? I'm glad to find out I do know how to recognize Spanish.
lessons I learned: - add watermarks to content - call people out online - let influencers know - don’t be an asshole
your hair looks nice here. cool!
Why is no one talking about cristine's hair!? It looks soooo healthy and shinyyyy
YOU LITERALLY LOOK GORGEOUS WITHOUT MAKEUP HOWWWW
In 6:20  When i saw it my reaction was like " WHAT ??? EVEN BRAZIL?????"  I'm brazillian and there are so much of this here to say things that are trending arrived in here. Im--
I hate when companies steal your work but I also love the content you make from it. Haven´t had such good 17 minutes in while.
YESSSS NEW VIDEOOOOO 🙌🙌💜✨
The're sTEAling her identaTEA☕☕☕☕
Cristine the Hammer Queen
spanish,,,, im so OFFENDED
7:26 she should've had troom troom say "aNyWaYs"
have brad mondo do your hair. Please like the heck out of this and also, please comment "please have brad mondo do your hair"
Hi
I came here from the retweet about that one mirror nail polish advertisement stealing your clips djdjsj
Spanish Cristine???? As a Brazilian I am truly offended! Jk not really, just thought it was funny hahahaha
Simply the whole time: that's not cool. Simply when ben's nails and face pops up: I'LL SUE YOU!!!!!!!!
6:18 "I can't read Spanish" 😂🤧 ... Who's gonna tell her?😂
When she said "I can´t read spanish" I was like its portuguese :,v but it doesn´t matter Cristine you could learn some day. Kisses in the forehead.
Not a single one of those nail salons removed the question mark from the thumbnail of DIP Powder nails? and it irks me
I'm laughing because I literally just saw a commercial the other day with clearly stolen footage from your old vids. I didnt get a chance to record or snap a pic of it. I should've, more evidence of crime.
We barelly use pronounce in portuguese and spanish, we often use A and O at the end of word to describe gender (example, gringo-man- gringa-woman-), now we are trying to promote the "inclusive lenguaje" in woch we use E instead O or A. Gringo it's a native english speaker (originally blonde so we use it among blonde people too) in context only can be a mean word so to speack
Your hair looks so silky and healthy
For the salons, I'm assuming they just typed "dip powder nails" on Google images and printed the first image, not thinking someone might own this because most Google image users don't I feel like it's totally different from the companies that take footage and deliberatly crop or blur out watermarks...
Thats not a gavel, that’s a full on mallet 😂
I'm here crying in Portuguese! Too many years of people saying we're spanish :( jk, love you Simply!
Just watched new videos from Simply Nailogical  and Threadbanger. Now I just need a new video from Safiya to have a perfect day.
We will sue for Ben🍌😤
Ela falando que português é espanhol- KKKKKKKKKKKKKK
All the dislike are from the company employees
Ily
Get em girl. These are the nail haters 😜 Your ruling?....guilty!
It's not spanish, it's portuguese
I love you MWauUuu
we need a skincare routine honestly that skin is lookin great
Gringo/a in Dominican Republic is used as a derogatory term to talk about native English speakers, normally the us or Canada, but I assume it wouldn't be much different for Australia and England. Tho that text is probably from a Brazilian company, so it just means a foreigner
7:33 that is Arabic and it says “The latest thing that nail polish technology achieved, A printer that print any nail polish design that you would ever want in 35 seconds.. exclusively in Algeria”
"I have binders"  My closeted ass: WHERE?! GIMME. *sees it's the other binder* oh...
THE GRINGAS PART HAD ME WEAK
Nobody:    Not even the nail thief:     Not even the watermark:      Cristine : y’All Ugly *disappears* (This is a vine if you don’t know)
I love to see how you do your hair
Cristine that is not Spanish but gringa means white girl
Cristen looks so 😍, idk if she’s wearing makeup but she looks no much prettier without makeup
It's been ten minutes, and I'm still laughing at "I can't read spanish"
Entre nous officel is in trabaule 😂
No one steals from Christine I will just call them out when I see it!!
IT IS PORTUGUESE!!!!! BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE NOT SPANISH
IF I EVER SEE A POSTER OF YOUR THUMB NAILS OR ANY PICTURE OF ANYTHING BELONGING TO YOU I WILL 100% TAKE IT DOWN!!!!
IDC IF U CARE OR ARE CURIOUS BUT THE BIT AT 07:29 reads as follows :  " latest technological advancement in the world of nails : a printer that prints any picture u want on ur nail in just 35 seconds, only and exclusively in Algeria  Click on this photo and u'll be redirected to the official page of this product"
Detective Christine is comming 😎🤠
These people are gonna be murdered by the simply fandom😂
Gringo or gringa its not mean, its just the way we refer to you, but it depends in the context you say it, it can be neutral,  friendly or mean
i’m literally disgusted with these companies/businesses that are being extremely disrespectful and unethical. i wonder what comes in their mind to use cristine as their marketing strategy illegally and thought ‘eh it’s ok she won’t notice’... seriously they need to compensate these and just start be original for pete sake
OMG I SAW THE VIDEO IN ARGENTINA TOO HAHAHAH but I didn't know it was wrong since I always see people playing nail videos on nail stores
Mexican here, while gringas are indeed a food, "gringo,a" it's also a term we use when referring to Americans. I mean, it still doesn't make sense, because you're Canadian, but yeah. Also, the ad was in portuguese, I know it looks awfully similar to spanish, but not the same language, lol.  Love you.💕
6:24 That's Portuguese, not Spanish.  And I'm  Sorry for the theft of your image and content.
Idk what Cristine did to her hair, but it looks different.  I like it.
her hair looks so good and shiny damnn I wish I had that
The company’s be like 😳
Her hairstyle be poppin
I was just waiting for her new video😍
Imagine her making a video in which she uses these products (^^)
Who else thinks the subscribe should turn holo
The nail salon signs could be a company that they are buying from. The big company is the one that stole your images and then they sell them to the salon owners .... still very wrong but I think that’s why is generally the same images being hang up.
“Gringa” is feminine for “gringo”, which we mostly use as a slang for foreigner  Edit: Oof, a lot of discussion. Just to be clear, I’m from Brazil and this is the way we use gring@. And I’m pretty it was a Brazilian ad that was shown (I mean, Brasil was literally written in the ad).
I ordered from Fuzzy Blankets and was told I’d get a tracking order within 5 days. About a month later and emailing them asking politely for an update I told them I was going to get police involved and not even the next day I got a response. Please do your research before ordering online. I left a comment on their Instagram about this an less than a week later their page was deleted
Omg this is so funny
Oh i’m kinda early..😳
Wooooow
Is it possible that the nail salons are buying product from companies that are including the thumbnail posters with their marketing materials? I just wonder how else so many different salon had the same poster.
And i was like omg charlie d'amelio lol😂
yasss queen✨✨ unfortunately it also happens alot to MKBHD
6:07 is not Spanish it is Portuguese. And yes, “gringa” is kind of a demeaning word to describe English speaking women, it is related more to country of origin than to race. I’m so sorry but that actually happens in Latin America.
Simply Nail-law-gical
Gringa= someone who is not from Brazil ( usually americans or europeans)
Companies really need to be held accountable for this because this happens so often unfortunately
and now i know who not to buy anything from whenever i decide i like makeup again!
👏multi👏chrome👏or👏go👏home👏👏👏👏👏👏👏✨🥵
Oop tea🫖🤣
5:25 this is actually “let’s nail Moscow” video and those particular ones are just fake nails
Can we just apreciate how I thought she said my *male* identity
💿H O L O H A M M E R💿
"Get to be like this White Girl"
girl's looking especially pretty in this video oh my god
13:35 make that a black water mark and put that in whenever you do a close up but make sure it’s on the middle finger lol I’d like to see them crop that 😏❤️
Please order fake Holo Taco
The jury has come to a decision and we find the defendants...    *Guilty*
I applaud you for your restraint, Cristine. It's ridiculous how they use your content and even PhotoShop over your watermark designed to prevent such things from happening! I would be furious!!
I am so distracted by the nail polish on Cristine's hands that I couldn't focus on the rest of the video content 😅
Can u plz make a holo taco polish that is a liquid holo mirror polish
One more reason why I love your channel: you have loud enough sound! Thank you.
7:30 OMG CRISTINE THATS AN AD FOR THAT DUMB ROBOT! Posted by a dumb instagram account that is not even related to nail art🤦🏻‍♂️ i recognized that account ( comedy account that is just like any other account in my country ALGERIA... they literally post any ad on their account to profit💰💰) So congrats youre famous literally everywhere😂😂😂 im proud that someone from my country knows who you are and that they sent you the ad🕺🏻
BAHAHAHA that's not a gringa, YOU are the gringa
I was so bummed that a friend/local hairdresser was using stolen pics. She admitted in her description that they weren't her work but it was really far down and hidden so the average person would assume it was her work. I bothered doing a google image search for each and crediting the original artist in the comment sections. I might lose this friend over it but like who does that!?
oh cristine... 6:20 is not spanish, it’s portuguese (it’s from a store in brazil)
That's portuguese not spanish 🤣🤣🤣 That ad said this product was trending in other countries and that's why you should buy it (they usually like this kind of products from outside the country because they think is fancy or something)
What if those companies see this video and will be like "sh*t she found out, what do i do"??!
Simply*Judge*Logical
Oh man I miss your videos you make my day!!! 😂💖
Not only stealing Cristine image, but the product they are advertasing is not even the one on the video!
CRISTINE SAYING I DON'T KNOW SPANISH JSHSBD
“Binders of affidavits” 😏😂
How do I get my skin to glow like yours like hohly sh-
she can't read spanish OR portuguese I guess ahahahha
I love that you finally did this. I've been seeing your images and videos on sites for years.
I’m cackling gringa is used to describe white girls lol
Gurl. I live....this was a   "Yaaaassssss drag them!"  Moment so thank you
I’ve been waiting for this one... turn it up
I’m dying!😂 it’s not spanish lol
the 42 dislikes are the companies 😂
Wait but why does the hammer have the holo toco design on it?? Is she gonna sell stickers orrr???
Yeah this random company stole a picture of my cat on Instagram from my sister and we bought the product so we have proof oh yeah
It’s Brazilian portuguese, gringa hahahaa
6:30 Its porguese xD
Why u r so orange?????
cristine, sorry to correct you, but I’m brazilian and we speak portuguese, but I unsderstand the misunderstanding , because both are latin languages
SimplyDetectives      Yes
Simply's hair looks beautiful ^^
simply CAN and WILL wack you with that mallet if you keep stealing her stuff! <3
I think that the salons are also being scammed tbh. They all have the same "promo poster" identically cropped?  I think scammers-r-us is actually selling small salons "their product" as a package which includes "their own promo materials" which implies it's far more organized than "Janet's salon" stealing your image.  The bigger problem is actually a health & safety issue.  There is no way those are the same products you used on your nails, or you'd know about brand X using your pics and there'd be a contract n money involved.  So these image thrives are also selling counterfeit products, which could be un tested, unsafe and even toxic.   If I see ANY product with photoshopped images, obviously stolen images... I back the hell away, those products are bound to be as big a scam as their do called promo materials.
I have see people use ur swatches as their own and it’s fucking hilarious like PLEASE I have been looking at Cristine’s nails for three years don’t fucking start
We have simplynailogical, simplyhairlogical, simplymomlogical, cristine the science qween and now simplysuelogical
i didnt even realize she doesnt watermark her videos anymore 😭
It's crazy, I work in marketing, and a lot of older folks think that if the image shows up on Google Image Search, it's good to use! 😲
Is not Spanish, is portuguese Christine
Okay hear me out  *Holo Taco stickers*
SIMPLY QUARTLOGICAL
I’m sorry this happens, they’re just lazy!
To quote Suga, BTS, Mic Drop, first verse, last line: SUE IT
Ahshsjsks I speak Spanish (Mexico) even though it wasn’t Spanish I still understood the word “gringo/gringa” I just means American or white person in an offensive manner, ;n; kinda sad that they used it cuz in Mexico it is known as kind of offensive but idk about Portuguese (if it’s the same “offensive-wise” tHe heck does that mean?)
as a brazilian guy, i just need to point out some stuff 1st of all, we speak portuguese. 2nd of all, "gringo" isnt supposed to necessarily refer to white people only, we use it to speak about foreigners in general. it appears as though this brand was trying to sell their products as something that is "so famous that is even used by foreigners" like, something that has even become famous outside of brazil. I hope that helped!! I love your content!
This is so sad that these people are doing this.
SimplySpilTeaLogical
I'm glad you did this video, most of these posts and accounts have been removed. Thanks for protecting consumers and other creators.
cristine reminded me of ‘itsuki’ from kakegurui when she said “they’re stealing our nails”. if you dont know, itsuki is a character from the anime kakegurui and she has a nail fetish, she gambles with people and if they lose, she takes their real nails and puts it/them in her collection.
"maybe i should get a hair cut" please let Brad Mondo do it? xD
And a lot of these companies just completely change their name. You see them on Instagram ALL the time. Often they will have “we have to go out of business, etc”. They keep using the same lines!
YouTube should change Cristine's Subscribe Button to green.. with color-shifting linear holo.. topped with a glossy taco.. and highlighted with an iPhone camera flash.
Your headphones 😂😂😂 you need an upgrade
❤❤❤
You look so much like Jen on that Thumbnail, it's crazy
And that’s the tea sis
Simply thats NOT Spanish, thats Portuguese. Love you, but PLEASE take care of little things for the Latin community 🤦🏽‍♀️
I painted my nails with Mint Money from the new metals collection yesterday and it’s everything I wanted it to be and more 😍😍😍
it's not spanish, it's portuguese!! an easy way to tell is that spanish uses "y" often whereas portuguese uses "o" often. also, very few words in spanish end with "m" and in portuguese is a bit more frequent (see "com" that in spanish would be "con"). Also yeah gringa is a white woman, but it's not a slur or anything like that, i guess people can use it as derogatory but wouldn't you do the same if you stumbled upon a karen?
You should go into one of those salons with the nail art/polish/etc. on one hand and be like I want this (point to picture) on my other hand
Simplynaildentity
This made my day!! I missed simply
This must be so frustrating *sighs*
You should paint your hammer with nail polish....
Me searching for the actual businesses’ comments in the comment section: 👁👄👁
I feel like LegalEagle should react to this! 😂
I am late. Nooooo. I just got my frosted metals box. Now I have something to do, while waiting to not have COVID anymore
Cristine, would you feel better if they at least kept the watermark to give you credit?
how are you so GORGEOUS
The 35 dislikes are from the ppl who stole it😂😂😂
And I thought they only stole Cristine’s nail content and face. But apparently so is Ben’s nail content. The audacity.
6:10 that's Portuguese!
All this time my stupid ass thought i was subscribed but i wasnt 😂 and ive watched all the vids for more than a year haha
I sentence Cristine to a crime of holo-less gavel. How can the court allow this Injustice?!?!!? Bish could've dripped holo taco all over...smh
They're stealing your face 'cause girl you kyoot.
As for the stores stealing your thumbnails, it turns out your thumbnails pop up on Google images if you Google like "dip powder nails" or "multichrome". (At least for me) I assume the nail salon owners didn't know they were taking from a youtube video they just grabbed what was on google images.
The one written in kinda arabic at 7:28 is actually an algerian post (was algerian arabic with some french) and it basicly talks about a machine that can paint the nails in 35seconds, that's why they used your picture with that thing. im actually surprised there are no algerian comments xD.
Not Cristine thinking Portuguese is Spanish 😭😂
those companies just commited sauce a side
This video gives me H3 content court vibes
The gringo thing is written in portuguese, not spanish
I'm not sure of what lenguage was that but definitely not Spanish 😅
Yo I watched a video on YouTube of a guy who owns a power washing business, and in the only video of his that I watched, he used Simply’s intro song.
“They’d probably steal my hair” 🤣🤣🤣
It would be fun seeing you going to one of those salons
I love that gavel!
Idk if anyone else has experienced this but a lot of my nail salons have like fake advertising for what they do. They advertise doing acrylic but then you go in and they don’t do it
"Manicure increas your femininity " Some reason I just burst out laughing at that and idk why but her face said it all
This feels like a Law and Order episode 😂
Simply- i-is.....is that a holo toco malet?
Love you
6:16 Cristine is so white i swear 😭❤️
Do any of those salons actually use Holo Taco, I wonder? It might not be false advertising then 😂
You should do Amung Us nails!
You must feel so violated.
7:19 yes, that's what it means. Not always used as a bad term, depends on context. Btw, the sentence is in portuguese. But "gringo" is used in all Latinoamerica.
You look so beautiful with your hair down😍😍 do it more often 😉😘
Will this mallet also be sold on Holo Taco
Gringo means white
Where's LegalEagle?
"Gringa" its a way to say that its a person who is from outside of Brazil haha its normal to say that in Brazil. The video is telling about a kit to make bigger nails in "poligel" in home just by yourself
Why does the gavel have the holo taco logo on it?
No es español :(
6:18 That's portuguese lol
hey simply, loving you hair!!
After this video, I got an ad for invisilyn for children. Using the audio “don’t worry about it sweetheart” 😳
Hey Cristine! So, the one that has your face is actually in portuguese; and it says " The new trend among international beauty gurus. Now available in Brazil, click the link and buy yours". Hope this helps you out a bit.
I’ve lost track how many times I’ve seen those mirror chrome ads with your nails, plus other nail accounts, on Facebook. I always report it.
7:34 it's in Arabic and it says,  '' the latest technology made a printer that can 3D print photos from your phone onto your nails ''  😶
If you posted videos on your own website instead??
47min,12k likes, 43 dislikes, 1.5k comments.   Me:.....
Is it just me or does Christine's hair look darker and amazing?
"Binders of affidavits!" lmao the subtle shade...
Cristine put.The.Mallet. DoWn. Feel like shes gonna hit Beyynn if he gets her Coffee XDDD😂😂😅😅😌😌👏👏👏❤💚🖤
I'm a digital freelance artist I watch this and get so angry. I'm really salty now 🤬🤬🤬
“What’s your sentencing for her”  “ELECTRIC CHAIR”
GET 'EM!
Cristine's sweater matches her tea cup just incase you didn't notice
Actually the product in 7:12 is not in Spanish, but in Portuguese
I’d love to see Cristine test holo eyeshadows. There’s some really pretty GENUINE holo on Etsy :D
I run Instagram & marketing for a small business and I still know that I cannot just steal copyrighted content. It is literally so easy to go on pixabay, pexels or unsplash to access free content
6:17 it was portuguese girl!!!!!
Finally a court case I am willing to watch lol
When I saw that picture of Ben I lost it
GOOD.  They should be called out.  It's never ok to take stuff that's not yours. Just because it's on the internet, doesn't mean it's free use.
That’s not Spanish, that’s Brazilian Portuguese 😂💕
As a brazillian, Im apologizing to you because of the gringa one. It isnt meant to be a mean way to speak of foreign people, but its just a way of saying you're not from here. When you see someone that is a tourist, we just call it gringo or gringa. Its not spanish tho, just Portuguese. Love your vids, xoxo
She reorganized her nail polish wall again!!😁
I wonder if the multi chrome face is the reason you’re having eye irritations now! 🥺 also love you!
Everyone go to those brands comments and call them out and shame them about this robery!
@brad mondo collab with nailogical pls
Gringa is a mean way of saying white person, or person who can't speak Spanish well or at all.
Waiting for this since Nail blogging Podcast ❤️
Can u test amazons 'holo' products
it’s not spanish it’s portuguese  **cries in brazilian**
6:19 that's not Spanish...
Love you so much!
simply "get a hair cut" no they will use it to sell nail products
I- Christine that's not Spanish xD
7:29  That's arabic  It says the last nail trend, a printer that draws any picture on you nails in 35 seconds. Press the pic to shop now. The page is Algerian OMG I'm so sorry that's embarrassing (Sorry for my bad eng it's my 3rd language)
Cristine, please. It's portuguese lmao
Ive had my brain mris pop up in very random places. Nothing beat waking up to see it posted on my Facebook newsfeed. I was like “hey that’s my brain!” It gets out more than me.
Hi Cristine, I'm from Spain. I love your videos, thank you for all your hard and satisfying work (✿^‿^)
I don't think Simply's heart is in these videos anymore.. She is loving the podcast and Holo Taco. Simply mailogicals are fun..
I don’t think nail salons are printing out posters themselves- especially since there are several that have them. My guess it there is a seller that sells them and nail salons are oblivious it’s stolen.
you should do a hair care/ hair routine video or like trying some hair hacks (maybe from troom troom who knows ) on really long hair! ;))
Waiting on some Holo Taco official socks
Gringa simply means white girl used by latins, in general it isn’t supposed to be offensive depending how do you use the sentence
Also, if a company is using stolen pictures/videos, they are probably cheap, so even if they are selling a product (like the video that has her face saying omg but no real product attached to that), its probably also done cheaply and not worth it.
7:30 it basically says that there is new tech that prints things I  your nails in 35 secs so they arent trying to replace you with a robot😂 and how it's only in Algeria  hope this helps cristine
I need a haircut   No they probably steal my hair  Lmao burn🔥
me: *sees title* Also me: *grabs the popcorn* YES MOM DRAG THEM
Please paint your gavel in holo. If it pleases the court.
Binders of affidavits!!! 😂😂😂 let me see what’s inside the binders, Cristine!!!
YOU SHOULD DO POLYGEL NAILS
Who gave Cristine a hammer? lol
Hello Cristine
Cristine: I can't read SPANISH Me: *cringes in Brazilian portuguese*
6:23 thats not spanish so im guessing its portuguese
This is totally off-topic but u look really pretty in this video :D
Off topic but does anyone know where you can get the nail oil pens?? The only ones I could find had a stiff end instead of a brush and it's awkward as hell to apply onto the nails. I just sort of apply directly from a dropper rn
"They'll steal my hair" omg lol I laughed so hard 😂
Someone seems to be doing a lot better in the eye 👁 department
Even Ben isn't safe, the audacity
Cristine, just in case, the word "gringo" is used in latin, to white people in general. So instead of calling them by their nationality or stuff like that , in the informal way, gringo is used. Its mostly not used for mean purposes and instead used as a jokingly way. (i know this since i live in a latin country)
Cristine looks more beautiful than usual in this video🖤
OMG Simply I was watching another video and I saw an ad for Holo Taco. I am SOOO proud of you and u probably wont see this so for everyone else give the video a like and have a great day!!
This is not spanish,  this is portuguese 🤣🤣🤣
I just started watching Suits and here I see Cristine has turned into a lawyer.   Hmmm Mom stop spying on me!
Gringo/a is just a white person lolol
Sort of early!
"GUILTY" ⚖️
Damn girl your hair is putting all the regular booty gurus to shame! Looking great, really missed your face ♡
Yes, it did say "The new hot trend among white girls" 😂😂
I really want to know if she bought that mallet for this video lol
Oh holo taco smoothing base, yup its confirmired they support holo taco jk
Add your nail pen as a HALO TACO product! I would rather give you the money instead of amazon.
EVEN THOUGH THAT WAS PORTUGUESE, I'M HISPANIC AND KNEW WHAT GRINGA MEANT AND OMG OUCH MY CAPSLOCK BROKE ):
Are you going to sue? At least those companies that are useing your face?
The left side of Cristine makes her look like she has short hair......it looks good on her though @-@
''SimplyARRESTHEMLogical'' Yes!!! Arrest them
i’m crying they even used ben’s nails 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Here in Germany we have a youtuber who made a Doner in a video and a few days later, this picture of him holding a Doner was on lots of menus and decorations all over the world.
Cristine you are so beautiful
for the nail ad in 7:27 it says, "the new latest technology for nails and it prints whatever pictures you have on your phone to your nails in 35 seconds" No one asked but its for anyone wondering haha
Last time I was this early Cristine was still doing nail art.
I think that dip powder nails they prolly just searched dip powder nails on google. I agree with you for the most part. But sometimes it just happens your thumbnails are free rain when it's just on google and anyone could use it
Hey Cristine! Thank you for making me smile aftet a hard day.💿💿💿
6:20 that's not spanish, it's brazilian
Is it just me or does Cristine kinda has a southern accent?
Unrelated but your hair looks insanely healthy in this video
Gringa means white lady 😂😂😂
You go girl shut them down
I people want to see a video of someone buying a product that used their image I recommend looking up Bernadette Banner. She is a sewing/fashion historian Youtuber that had images of a historically accurate, hand sewn, medieval gown she made stolen. She bought the dress, compared the two items, and went in on all the companies that did things like this and fast fashion in general.
Ok, so, gringa is both a giant taco/quesadilla (at least in Mexico) and a word to refer to females from the States  (originally) and pretty much anyone who speaks English (gringo for men), and even though it can be said in a mean way, it's usually just a way to refer to them. Though, I can be wrong cause that ad was in portuguese.  Source: Mexican uwu
This must be so frustrating
hahaha the gringas part took me out, yes its offensive as f
H3h3 entered the chat
I find it pretty funny (and sad, let's be honest) that some salons printed a thumbnail that is literally a question. Like "Dip powder nails????"
Thank you for not buying the products from the businesses that stole your content! I have seen other youtubers make similar videos, but they buy the products and compare them. While I understand they wanted more content and it’s interesting to see the comparison, I would not want to support a company that is using my face, nails, or voice in their ads.
It’s flattering but WRONG
Perfect content. Cristine you’re a fantastic judge. Their sentence was too kind and lenient. Thank you fir calling out these a holes.
6:02 hey Cristine, Brazilian viewer here, let me maybe give some clarity to this one. First in Brazil we don’t speak Spanish, we speak Portuguese, (just a heads up, Brazilians tend to get really upset that very few foreigners know that we don’t speak Spanish) The “A nova febre entre as gringas” really translates to something like “The newest trend among gringas”. Gringas isn’t in it self an offensive word, it’s just a slang term for foreigners, most commonly used for English speakers (gringas is used when talking about females, and gringos when talking about males or both). The formal term for it in Portuguese would be “estrangeiros”, but that takes too long to say, so in day to day convos, memes and (as you saw here) advertising we usually will use gringa. However, the term can have a pejorative meaning, it really depends on context. (JUST AS AN EXAMPLE, based on this vid Brazilians could imply that you’re ignorant to other American cultures and realities by saying “oh look, another gringa that assumes that every country in Latin America speaks Spanish...). In the add I don’t think they were trying to used you or your brand to sell their products, I think they used your face to reference a major foreign YouTuber who uses the same type of product that they were advertising in a way to promote it (that’s really not an uncommon tactic, basically say and show that someone who speaks English is using a product and people here tend to associate that with quality and innovation). Anyways, hope this gave some clarification, love you vids, keep up the good work! 😉
I wish that we got to see Ben's reaction, to his face being stolen.
Damn im watching this when cristine post this 40 nins ago..... Hehe
Wait so they took something from your own company?! That should be a lawsuit. Holo taco deserves better
Do more troom troom  vids
When i see a cristine nail art on a salon, i would say to them that i want that nail art, exactly like cristine's. But if they fail, ill show them the original clip. a satisfaying moment when they know that not from them
The 22 dislikes are by those brands. 👀👀👀
I was going to sleep but this video holds me up
Simply Nailogical Is such a great motivation for me on my youtube journey,I am glad I was motivated by this woman
Agora Sand Ad: Get yours here Cristine: *low key freaking out* What are they talking about? Ben or the nail oil pen? I’ll sue you!!!! Me: Are they making Bens in labs now? Cos I need me a tea bae 😂😂😂😂
Love from india 🇮🇳
6:00 is not Spanish, is Portuguese lol
Someone cancel her for calling mirror chrome holo
Why did I think that companies were stealing her old peelies and using them as their own nails...
6:21 LOL! So ok, they're using your face saying Oh My God, with a caption (in Portuguese, not Spanish) saying "The new fever among American girls". They basically grabbed that one-second clip of you to exemplify a stereotypical white chick reacting to the product 😂
Cristine's hair though ❤️ be careful cristine! Watch out for shampoo brands
I literally just watched that chrome video lol
Your hair looks so pretty!
She looks so young today and so much like Jen 😂. Lots of love from Germany
6:18 that's Portuguese :)
*Half the comments:* That's not Spanish, that's Portuguese *Other half of comments:* Cristine banging the mallet or anything court related
Thats NOT spanish!!! Thats Portuguese...
gringo isnt necessarily mean, its just a way of calling all non-latin people tbh. the term is used in both spanish and brazilian portuguese
i haven't seen stolen footage from you but I did call out someone "selling" majora's masks using stolen footage from Bobby Duke. i fucking SPAMMED their comments and they ended up blocking me 🤣
Christine just needs a shirt that says “BEYYYYYN”
That wasn't Spanish. That's Portuguese lol.
Nails are more important than faces.
We can sue them for their tea
They have my footage, my nails, AnD mY vOiCe! - Cristine, 2020
I want the Mallet
does your nail polish deliver to the UK ???
I just wanted to comment that the Ad at 6:15, is Brazilian, so the stuff written in it is in Portuguese, not Spanish 🤠👌
A nova febre entre a gringa = the New trend amoung foreing. Gringo has a neutral tone. Is Brazilian portuguese.
Cristine there is youtube channel called 'How to cook that' and she finally figured out how to make HOLOGRAPHIC CHOCOLATE!! Everyone please checkout her channel she is wholesome person..
Did she change her light or does she have a tan? Genuinely curious, I live in ireland so help.
as a latin american i can confirm gringo & gringa is used a slang but gringa is also as the name of a taco so dont worry it basically means female american but make it bad word uwu luv u cristine ❤️
Identity Theft is Not a Joke
Hi
Lol why doesn’t it turn green
Girl I don’t know what that is but it ain’t Spanish. 😭😭
FYI that was not Spanish, it was Brazilian Portuguese.
She definitely should comment on them and say stuff like did i allow you to use pictures of my nails or...
Burn 🔥 them all
Am holo late lol 😂
Yesssssss
0:50  Cristine: "I have binders binders..."  Holds holo toco collection box   😂😂
That's not Spanish, that's Portuguese
The Arabic text in 7:32 is talking about the product and I think they are selling it “exclusively” in Algeria as what they said😂.
Oooooooooo!!!!! Today Cristine brought the tea, not Beyn 🙊☕️😋
Portuguese ***
No one:  Me : watching Cristine's video in mid night    I wonder if she notice my comments 🤔
Burn down all the other companys  They need to die!!!!!!!!
6:04 BRASILLL PORRAAA
Assholes!!! Makes me so mad
Finally ❤️❤️😊😊
MAKE👏🏼 THEIR 👏🏼POCKET👏🏼 HURTS👏🏼 (though it's gonna be hard to sue them all......)
Please go to one of these salons and after they finish tell them that's your picture and see at least how they react
Give us the names of the salons. We just wanna talk... 😂
I has an Idea for next merch... SOCKS After all she is a sock so why not. Also maybe a hoodie??
The fact that Cristine’s gavel is a large mallet/ looks similar to a hammer makes me inexplicably happy
USE GOOGLE TRANSLATE
6:25 That's not Spanish, that's portuguese
Cristine it's portuguese, not spanish! Kisses from Portugal 🇵🇹
That’s what happens when you’re the best in the biz!!
Omgggg this is not Spanish is portuguese, and "gringas" means people from another countrie most used to american or canadian people
There theifs
Just put a watermark across your entire screen 😂
What hair products are you using?
I laughed so hard at the thumbnail
Gringo means white male and Gringo means white female lol
Wow just.. wow the audacity i-
The awkward moment when you become a gringa by confusing Spanish and Portuguese 😅
Hey Christine! I’m so happy I’m somewhat early to your video! ILYSM keep doing what your doing and your holo nail polish + taco coat is on my Christmas and birthday list! If you noticed this comment I would be so happy!! but I hope you have a great dayyyyy!!
I literally saw the silver polish on an instagram ad yesterday. It didn't click for me until I saw your video now...
How are your eyes doing?
I feel like shes being really healthy these days and she looks really great🥺 like half a year ago she didnt enjoy filming vids and now she looks so happy
danganronpa trial 1: who stole the nails
The queens here yuhhhh
Cristine you need merchandise that says " Don't mind me just spilling the tea"
I'm hangover so this is literally perfect timing
cristine likes  everything long.. her nails her hair and her big long socks
I really wanted to hear  - " Bennnn...Let's spill the tea! " 😂  Love you Cristine...Ben ....Menchie and Xyler ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ben in the end- hilarious
If you comment on stolen post that they stolen, you are still supporting them! The algorithm will count it as interactions and boost those posts... so unless you do it really well, you rather don't comment if there are already a few but ALWAYS REPORT IT tot the platform!
Wildest was the one who just used your face to say white girls loved the product. 😂😂😂
There are German YouTubers who made a Döner 🥙 on YouTube for entertainment, nothing special. Now, a lot of Döner places in Germany use the thumbnail and it has become a little meme XD
Do you still use the companies you used to promote? I remember twinkled T and FUN lacquer and a few others. Do you still use their products? You haven't in a WHILE in any videos so I was just wondering.
Yay im here in the first 30 mins
The advertising is in portugueses not spanish and "gringas" means someone from a another country.  And yes, it would be something famous in another country
I thought she was going to DM them and ask to remove the pictures. That would be interesting to see the results.
I still dont get why brand do this tho... Like what? So unethical.
simply court logical is a MUST SIS
I believe the clip with “Spanish” is from Brazil, which means it’s actually Portuguese. Will make a difference in the translation.
6:30 it’s not even Spanish, ITS PORTUGUÊS
You straighten your hair ohh it looks so preety
That dip nail thumbnails at salons look so stupid u could easy just take a good photo and get it printed. Why steal a thumbnail for a poster???
Tear them down queen
Is no one going to talk about GOOD her hair looks down in this video.❤️
Wouldn't using footage from Holo Taco, an actual company, be an actual crime that you could go to court for?
Idk why but Simply is GLOWING in this video. Also, this is so weird. I just rewatched CoryxKenshin’s video last night about companies that were advertising stolen merch on their websites and now this. I completely agree. Idc how well off someone is, don’t steal content in any form from other people. Ask them to use it and give credit, PAY an artist for original content or create something yourself. This is just slimy and disrespectful.
please sell that mallet on the holo taco website. i live in a country that you can't ship nail polish to, but a mallet should be fine bahaha
oh no even cristine mistaking portuguese for spanish
6:15 that’s not Spanish 😅😂
Simply Lawlogical
Fun Fact! That YouTube Thumbnail stealing and using it in shops, happened to a german Youtuber from the Channel SpaceFrogs! They did a cooking video and on the Thumbnail was HIS FACE WITH THE FOOD??? ITS SO WEIRD
Holo my friend
Yeah, gringo/gringa is definetly a spanish slur to refer to english speaking people, specially white people from the US. It doesn't have an offensive connotation as the n word does for example. That was portuguese, not spanish though.
I love how the color of the mug is matching your outfit
Simply stolen nails
I wanted to see Ben’s reaction to his toes being stolen 😂
Thats portuguese
7:23 that's exactly what it means 😅
I got an ad that was using Cristines nails.......
Can I get a heart I am your biggest fan and you like the only YouTuber I watch for "quality content "😎 and It would be so cool that you notice me and I've watched every single one of your videos and If you dont see this its okay i still want you to know😝🌻🌻🌻🌻👽👽👽
Criminal! I feel that these companies usually obvious as they are abnormally cheap prices as they save money by committing absolute scammage.  Also why people harping on that it Portuguese but no one giving a translation. lol
YOU HAVE AN ADD I SAW YOUR ADD
Live you Cristine! Cristine court justice!!!
The Holo Taco mallet though
U r so gorgeous. Your sense of humour is AMAZING. U never fail to put big smiles on my face. And ur hair is rly PRETYYYYY ❤❤❤
All the dislikes are from the companies that stole from you
I am from India can I get a ❤️ pls 🥺🥺
You know you can report them doing that
The joy I feel when Youtube is playing a Simply Nailogical mix for me and this new video pops up :D
Pls recreate the holo chocolate video by @how to cook that aka Ann
You're really good at what you do. You make some amazing beautiful looking art. When people she how good you are, they all start trying to steal a part of your success. They probably have none of their own.
That’s not Spanish! That’s Portuguese
I live for Cristine trying to read portuguese 😔❤
"i can't read in spanish" OUCH ouch :') we speak portuguese in brazil lol
Ad: text in portuguese cristine: i can't read spanish me: :| well... that is not spanish also me: confirm suspicius that is portuguese before commenting
It is not so serious but I looked at Cristine's dms, lexime.fairuse.org/q4MoJp/k5IOfq.html I admit that I am sad, poor boyfriend I hope it changes
looking good Simply!! Is your eyes okay now??
Not spanish Cristine! It said BRASIL (Brazil) in the beginning of the video :( And I love how google detected that it was portuguese XD But yeah, it's somewhat normal here in Brazil to see small local shops using famous people's images without permission.
bens picture in the ad sent me 😂😂😂 holy shit
Need more tea☕️
💿👩‍⚖️💿 ALL RISE FOR JUDGE SIMPLY 💿⚖️💿 COURT IS NOW IN SESSION 💿🔨💿
Im dying at the "I can't read Spanish" 😂🤣
Not spanish... PORTUGUEEESE
I dare you to go to one of the nail shops and tell them that is you YouTube video
Oh man I love Pinterest but it’s insane how many companies use your nails to promote themselves.
I've seen the one of the mirror chrome with the holo reflection. I usually ignore those ads but of course that one caught my attention. First it was the holo then it was "wait...aren't those Cristine's nails? 🤔". I called them out on it.
Hahahaha! Not binders of affidavits!
wait thats not spanish, thats portuguese! and as a brazilian person i can translate that   "the new fever between north americans (?), poligel nails blablablabla"   also, its super cringe the whole thing
Was anyone else just bing watching her videos before they saw the notification? Just me ok 😅😂
The latest electronic way for beautiful nails is the nail printer it prints any photo on your nails from your phone in 35 seconds now only in Algeria, this is the  translation for the ad that you said that you had no idea what it said , hope it helps I'm not that good at translating
In spanish as a mexican it means white girl...lol
"A nova febre entre as gringas" can be translated as "the new trend abroad".
Saw a video on Facebook that was using footage from your June release for the rainbow collection
FYI: Gringo= Northamerican
its kinda funny that people ask if there was a permission given? obviously not? why would y brand use a footage of x brand's product :D
Did she do something with her hair??!???!?!!!?!!??!??!😲
6:14 girl that is not Spanish 😭 it's Portuguese 6:21 I don't really know Portuguese but it says "the new fever between the gringas (American females)" it's so funny 😭
imagine this comment blows up for no reason
Just came across one on FB whilst watching this, so asked them why they're stealing others content. Will wait for a reply but probably never get one 😒
6:18 thats not spanish jaja :]
I HOT A HOLO TACO AD BEFORE THE VIDEO THAT WAS AWESOME
have seen six seconds and i already love this video😂😍
Veryyy unrelated but, your hair looks GORGEOUS in this video 🙄❤️❤️❤️
thought thus said 'calling companies' kinda disappointed 😔
We need an Among Us nail designs  She could have different character with different hats on each nail 💙
So... should we be seeing a holo taco hammer coming to holo taco soon? XD
Cristine is a mood💕✨
Unrelated to the video, but Cristine sharing your workout videos has been immensely helpful to me! It's really motivated me to start working out as part of a routine, to push myself, and also having a healthy attitude towards fitness as a woman. It's wonderful to feel stronger, and getting rid of the notion as exercise solely for weight loss to be more attractive.
Hello it’s me
You should sue those companies.
that add was in portuguese, not spanish aahah
6:14 Cristine I just want to say that the video is not in spanish. Is in Portuguese. They even wrote Brasil in there😂
6:03 ok, to give some context , it's a brazillian company (i don't want to sound annoying, but the name of the language is Portuguese)  and it says '' the new fever among the gringas( slang for foreign but female)''   6:12 polygel nails that can be made at home, promissing long and resistent nails up to 20 days.  Im used to seeing things like this, specially coming from brazillians lmao,sue them queen!  💅💅💅
Fuck that!! Destroy their business!
Can you guys not throw shade to Simply for not telling the difference between Spanish  and Portugese? As a non-Latin-origin language speaker, it's hard to expect people to know the difference. If you're so confident in your attack, I double dare you to tell the difference between Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian(Latin letters) languages.
Is not spanish... is portugueses... even said Brasil in IT!! Lol
Here in mexico we usually call the white people "gringo" or "gringa", for so many years was a despective way to refer to a foreigner, but now is more like a part of our language, and we don't say it in a disrespectful way anymore or we prefer to call them "güerita or güerito". The legend says that in the war between mexico and USA, the USA soldiers were called by the color of their uniforms and the most heard was the green ones so mexicans heard the "green go!!" Call but they heard it as "gringo" so they thought that that was a way they called themselves, and that word spreaded to another latin countries. Also a gringa is a really delicious food here in mexico, flour tortilla, pork meat specially seasoned, pineapple, string cheese, Onion, coriander, a little bit of lemon  and a really hot sauce.
Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!
Finally she posted😍💕
6:10 It's Portuguese, Cristine.. Brazilians speak Portuguese, not Spanish. It says it's the new fever among foreign girls / bloggers has arrived in Brazil, it "promises long nails and resists til 20 days". But it's Portuguese!!
Does Simply know about the holo chocolate How To Cook That Made?!
I discovered your channel recently (between this video and the former one) and I basically watched almost all your video I’m under a spell 😭. Also I’m very happy as a french to learn some insults to improve my vocabulary thanks you❤️
NOT SPANISH.
7:30 translation: latest technology for nail polish, its a printer that draws on your nail any photo from your phone in just 35sec, exclusive now in algeria.  Click on this photo to get to the official page for this printer
Love your videos
I’m actually earlyyyyyyyyy
Just realised how recognisable her thumbnail is.
7:18 ok, so yeah, "gringo" it's a slang for native-english speaking people, but not necesarilly mean lol, it's just a way of saying it. And a bit before that timestamp you said that was spanish, but it's acyually portuguese, but I guess you noticed it on the translator   Anyways, love from Argentina, and f*ck all those companies using your videos 💅💿
I’m surprised no one has claimed your hair as a result of their “magic growth product”
Can anyone with legal experience tell me why she can’t sue?
It sucks that there's not much we can do about the stolen photos (or the product) removed from stores. Atleast we can spread the news with YouTube and hopefully something will be done at some point in the future.
Something is off in this video:  •Cristine has her hair down •There isn't Menchie licking her bed •There are iridescent pillows •Beyyyn didn't bring Cristine the tea •Cristine doesn't wear her beauty guru makeup.
The gringa needs a ride from the airport
The holo gavel 🤣😂
Lmao they shamelessly used you and Ben😂😂
The commercial around 7:00 was in Portuguese, I think. But in spanish, specifically in Mexico, a gringa can mean 2 things: a variety of a taco and also a woman from the US.
You need to get a shirt that says let's get this teaaaaa!!!!!!!
You got the translation basically spot on 😂 Screw them... on behalf of Mexicans and Mexico, I apologize lol Shania said “man, I feel like some suing” 😂 I wanted to see Ben’s reaction to being in one!
WAIT! Show Ben his nails! I need to see a reaction!
The members of the Holo Jury have come to a decision.      Simply has the right to Holo, Holo and most importantly, Holo.  And her title as the Holo Queen, so all them companies better bow!!
Thank you for not being a dick to the salons. Is it okay for them to do that? No. Is it as horrible as the scammers? Hell no. Also! The fact that there were so many of the same posters makes me wonder if there's someone making the posters and selling them and the salons have no idea? I dunno.
This is so funny because I was just reading what happened with Studio Mucci and how Lisa Frank stole from her
Low key dying over the mallet being used as a gavel. Double use? 🤣
Cristine can make a video out of anything and still make it entertaining!
You googling gringa SENT MEEEEE
How to cook that made holo Chocolate
Christine I love you ♥️♥️♥️❣️
Uuuuh. I just realized that I can see the Holo Taco shop in the youtube app 😱 Not that I need it, since I have already found my way to halo taco, but still pretty cool
I clicked sooooo flicking FASTTTTT yo know 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍😍
The punishment was to harsh simply... you shoulda gone easier on them judge!!!
"Simply Judgelogical" Ooooh new look!!❤️❤️🔥
BINDERS of affidavits! very topical 😂
Someone has been watching h3’s content court! 😂😂😂😍
Damn
Thats a lot of violations
Peep that gorgeous Holo HT packaging sticker on the mallet 😏
Now that Cristine doesn’t put watermarks on all her videos, the video feels naked 😂
Omg! 😂😂😂😂 I’m crying  I’m from Mexico and “Gringa” it’s the way we call woman from USA, also we said “gringo” for man. And there’s a dish call like that because it’s similar to what USA think is a taco, it’s like a joke. But also I’m not an expert, I can be wrong.  And also, some people use the term “gringa” or “gringo” as a bad thing, but it isn’t always like that.  And also, whatever language it is in the video it’s not Spanish 😂😂😂 I don’t know what it is 🤷🏻‍♀️  Love you holo queen
Cristines mind while saying: "YoU WaNnA uSe mY fEeT?? :"My fEeT mY RuLeS!!"
She got her gavel
I hope someday 🤞 she will notice me . I am your biggest fan 😌    Btw I am an 11 year old
Yooo early kinda...
I've seen people asking to edit out photographer's watermark on picture proofs, so they can avoid paying for the actual pictures, and rightfully people have called them out that it's illegal. I also don't know why they chose a picture with "Dip Powder Nails?" to advertise they do dip powder, the thumbnail having the question mark doesn't make it seem very appealing in a salon.
Yooo heyy simplyyy
No steal, just share! Be frand.  (Also, share moneys and credits.)
Cristine: steal my nails I don’t care   Also Cristine: WHAT ARE SELLING?  THE NAIL OIL PEN OR BEN? I’ll SUE YOU
7:30  Me as an Arabic person: well holo there hehe Translation (trying my best LOL): the latest technology for manicure 💅🏻 and its a printer that draws any photo on your phone❤️🇩🇿 on your nails only in 35secs... Exclusively and only in Algeria  (Something in Algerian I couldn’t understand) Hope this helps to get the main idea of this post!!!
woah might go to the la salon since im in that state <\3
"gringo" (m) or "gringa" (f) is how south americans refer to usa citizens in a mean way yes :) both in spanish and portuguese (spoken in brasil)
Not Cristine learning what gringa is omg
Cristine: "i can't read Spanish" the video: CLEARLY IN PORTUGUESE
CRISTINE USING THE INTERNSHIP WITH THAT SEXIST LAWYER FINALLY!!!
the ad: agora no *Brasil* cristine: _i can’t read spanish_
Why do companies have to use someone else's picture? Is your company that shitty that you have to steal?
It would be fun to see a collab with Legal Eagel, with this topic. He is a lawyer on yt 😊 to get it from multiple percpectives
7:28 this says The latest technology for manicure, and it can draw you, ie |  A picture you have on the phone: On your nails in a period of 35 seconds ... Exclusively and only in Algeria, I can tell you on Lavotou that the official page of this printer will bring you out.  And is basically advertising a nail printer on their website for Algeria    This sort of scam isn’t exclusive to you tubers either   I was once with my family getting breakfast at a hotel on holiday and my dad was scrolling through Facebook my dads Pakistani and so am I and he speaks Urdu , Arabic and Punjabi so when he saw a post of Robert Downey junior getting the mechanical heart or what it was called from iron man 1 fitted in make up. My dad showed me and asked if I recognised him. I said that it was rdj and the writing around the image was clearly there to scam people because it said “ this poor man is having the worlds first mechanical heart fitted but he needs funds to buy one” obviously a scam so I told my dad about it and reported it and commented on the post warning about it .   It doesn’t matter how famous you are it’s easy for people to be caught by scams
When people say gringa/gringo they using to describe white people.
Hey Cristine! I was just wondering if besides stealing your face and nails you are aware that some companies are replicating your merch? I saw a few companies a few moths ago and knew that you definetly did not approve that but I don't know if you even knew.
omg Cristine, its not spanish, it's portuguese/ brazilian xD (portuguese girl here speaking)
Can’t sleep and getting this notification has made it so much better! 😍
Other Companys: using Cristined ThumbNails And reviews of nail products  Cristine: iM cOmInG fOr yO bIsSeS💿❤😍
I'm glad you made the decision not to buy the products! It really doesn't matter if the product is decent, they still stole content.
17:41 It's portuguese not spanish.😆
she said spanish NOOOOOO , its portuguese Also "gringa" is used for someone that is not from your country  , like if you came to Brazil you would be a gringa because you ar not from here :) ily
They even try to sell Ben??😳😳
NO NOT CRISTINES NAILS
Dear simply,with no H u are smart and plus lucky that u have used those watermark because this stupid world is soooo bad that can make u cry so....feel yourself lucky🤪😎😎❤
Last time I was this early the tea was still in the cup
Comment number 549
The fact that Ben’s nails and face are also in the videos 🤣💀
In case anyone is wondering "gringo/gringa" it's just the way Latin Americans refer to people from the States, not some food in this case haha
those 6 dislikes are from the nail n face stealers
Your hair is just so..........✨good ✨
You're so calm about it how do you do that T_T It makes me so angry to see people stealing content like that  >:(
I laughed so hard with the "gringa" part 😂 it technically means female from the USA. The text wasn't in spanish by the way, it's portuguese.
The dislikes are the companies she's calling out
Hey Simply, you probably won’t see this, but if you do. I know spanish, (Mexican, specifically) and with some piecing together since this must’ve been in Brazilian or Spanish (from Spain) I can confirm, they are selling some sort of a gel alternative. And are saying that “The hottest trend among white girls” (You were right, you figured it out better than I could) They probably don’t know your Canadian, since “gringas” is usually used to refer to American women. I hope this helps.
wow did you get a new camera? The quality is INSANE 🤩
I have a tiny Instagram account and I have seen my nail design on aliexpress wtf, little nobody me, so I can image your position on this. Btw gringa is not an insult more of a description for a white girl.
No one:  Cristine: 👩‍⚖️ OrDeR iN tHe CoUrT 👩‍⚖️
Thread banger and simply nailogical uploading on the same day maybe 2020 will end without an apocalyptic ice storm
amazingggg
Go Simply
Who’s here from her snap story LOL
You trying to read a portuguese ad with a spanish accent lol
The people who disliked are the companies that stole your content
Your hair looks pretty, pls dont let them steal it 🙀
Hiii ✌️💜
Yes go off sis!!! Call them out!!! I can’t believe people printed your thumbnails.
They playin’ fuckin DIRTY
Who else wants to beat the crap out of theses companies.........No just me ok
Portuguese not spanish
It's portuguese not spanish lmao
I quite frequently comment on ads of obvious scam websites, explaining how to spot scams. The pages probably delete my comments shortly thereafter, but I hope at least a few people have seen them and learned something!
I was hoping for Ben's reaction to his nails and photo being stolen XD
06:23 Spanish? Really? Brazilians talk Portuguese Cristine 😂😂😂
I wonder if those businesses use those thumbnails because it's the first image that comes up in a Google search
gringa/o = white person
THATS NOT SPANISH AHAHAH
Now those suckers are in for a soaking! Loud and clear,  cHrIStiNe’S HeRe!!  Newsies anyone??
At least for the dip powder one being so commonly used, I wonder if it comes up on google images as "royalty free"? I've heard of google search settings that basically help you find stock images, so I wonder if some of your thumbnails are ending up there and people are assuming that it means they can use them in their advertising. Especially that first one with the "ombre nails" poster as well, that was my first thought. "they googled royalty free images for the nail services they offered and this is what they found." doesn't make it right, but might explain it.
Company: uses simply's photos. Cristine: Aw shit, here we go again.
Can't believe I'm early for once. If only I was this early to school...
6:15 It's not Spanish, it's Portuguese.
Why does Cristine looks so young here.
You hair looks so healthy!!! 🖤
Simply with her hair down?? this is a gem
Go Cristine It’s your court day!  Are they gonna steal socks Me: Cristine the Sock - noooo you’re a sock Cristine???
The fact that they even left Ben's face in the nail oil one 🤦🏻‍♀️
I saw your nail art on wish 👀
Nooo
Hi
I clicked so fast on this! I’ve been seeing some really ridiculous shit lately. Even our local salon had a picture from a Korean nail artist! 😒  I told the manager and she took it down but they just put a different picture up from your video of Halloween nails a few years ago. I think I’m gonna go call the store owner...  😈
i’m from Mexico and “gringa” just means someone from the US. Theres a myth about the origin of the word, people say that when there was the war between de US and Mexico the american soldiers wore green uniforms so the mexican people shouted “green go!” at them so yeah, there’s that
i love the "no❤ no❤ no❤ no❤" thank you for cheering me up today!! love you cristine!! <3
Couldn’t take a tea break, I ran out of tea and all the stores sell is Lipton and I don’t like it lol ... Long story short I drop my cookie in my coffee🥺 lol
holo simply !
I’d sue everyone of them that I could. This is not ok.
Anybody else thinking the multichrome powder is the reason behind of the rashes on the face/swollen eyes?
I'm earlier than a white family to an airport
Lol a small incidence...   Last year, I made a business studies project in which we had to show the whole manufacture to sale to advertising of 1 product... Any product... I got to do the project on highlighter... And the way I am obsessed with Simply and the booty gooru she is, *SHE WAS MY BRAND AMBASSADOR LOL!!!* like Literally, I searched a photo of her wearing highlighter, and put that in my file and labelled it *"brand ambassador- Cristine rotenburg"* lol... 😂  Cristine dont sue me... It was just a class 11 project who no one except my teacher is going to see 😳😳
That is not SPANISH you girl. It's Portuguese! Idiomas, querida.
Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!
Thats not Spanish lol it’s Portuguese 😂😂 don’t know if gringa is an actual word in Portuguese but at least in Spanish it’s Mexican slang used specifically for Americans. It comes from Mexicans trying to tell the US military to get out of our country during the Mexican American war. The US wore green uniforms so “green-go” which later became “gringo”
They stole images of Ben's nails, too??
You gonna sell some socccs? Lol omg
your hair looks so prettyyy
I just wanna know how much time did she spend straightening her hair🤔🤔🤔
Christine: "I can't read Spanish" Me: *cries in Portuguese*
She be looking hella healthy tho. Look at that skin, she can beam that glow and kill those mofo companies
its literally 12:52am rn and im supposed to be doing homework- edit i finished this vid at 1:07am -
The gel thing is Portuguese XD from Brasil 🤣🤣 they use the Gringa expression there yeah. Haha
Love the video, but the blurred background was really hard on my eyes for some reason
Threadbanger and Cristine posted on the same day? What did I so to deserve this?
“They’d probably steal my hair too”
The "A nova febre entre as gringas" thing is in brazilian portuguese HAHAHAHAHAHA
If you think this is bad, think about all of the scam companies who trick people into just giving them money for nothing. They most often prey on the elderly and people who don't understand technology well because they're easiest to trick. And these places are overseas where local police do next to nothing to stop them.
Beyyyn: Alriiiight... Have fuuuun... 😳
Cristine, pls be careful with that hammer, u might accidentally smash ur nails....😭❤️ Someone might actually make a video "Simply Nailogical putting her nails in danger for 5 mins straight!"
omg simply speaking Portuguese lol
I'm so confused about why a nail salon would steal the thumbnail, how difficult is it to do dip powder on someone, take a photo and print it.
Cristine is going to get some much crap because of the the Spanish comment 😂 It's portuguese Cristine! Yes, it's similar but it's not the same.
If I walked into my local salon and saw one of those pictures of your nails, I would DEMAND that they take it down right then and NEVER go back! This is so wrong!😡
THE NOTIFICATIONS WORKED
The picture of Ben in one of the ads had me dead
6:00 is when I realized that Cristine is still using the old iphone earphones 😳
Did Sheena realize that one of the company's was copying her product from Halo taco and that she could actually sue them for it or something like that I'm no lawyer
They using cristine's face cause they don't have the money to hire models of their own 😔
LAW & ORDER DUM DUM
that is NOT spanish, looks like portuguese, "gringa" is what an american girl would be called as. is not specifically a demeaning term. is also a name to call you if you are blonde or have white features.  EDIT: TO BE SPECIFIC this is how we use that word in Perú. It can be used differently in other countries of latam. Maybe you guys csn comment here how do you use it in your countries. And I forgot we use that term for some foreigners too.
I'm guessig the salon just google search pictures and some of them happen to be yours
bring that mallot to vidcon
Luv ya simply judge logical 💅✨
I feel like those print outs are actually bought as posters from a drop shiping website. I see a lot of designs stolen and sold on them
Yes Cristine, gringo or gringa is a derrogatory term used un latin america to refer specially to unites states people. Example: "¿Quien se cree la gringa esa que es?" Who does this gringa think she is?
Cristine: I've had it, officially!
No more judge Judy.....  Judge Simply is here and she wants her nails back! 💅🏻
How frustrating that there is nothing you can do to stop this.
Love your videos, shame for all this companies
The people who dislike this are the companies she exposed
This is the only drama on simply’s channel 😎
Is no one gonna say how amazing that white hammer was ugh i love itttt.
THEY USED BENS NAILS OH MY GOD
After all cristine's videos I've repeatedly watched, I finally can watch a new video. 😭
Loving the holo taco hammer lmao
I didn’t understand anything you said in the beginning of the video! 😂
6:17 that's not Spanish that's Portuguese :(
I legit just watched her podlogical about partnerships in nail companies like wooooooot
6:18 Cristine: “I have no idea what it says because I can’t read Spanish” the text: **is in Portuguese**  Edit: (I was not calling her out omg guys I  just found it funny)
-Did you give this company permission to use your nails? Cristine: No ❤️
Looks to me like some shady company is producing posters from your thumbnails!??
Cristine “Gringas” mean “foreign girl” so the translation would be like “the newest trend among foreign girls”
Early af
that's not spanish that's portuguese dkdbdkdbnfsndbdbs it's an ad from a brazilian company
But like, is Cristine skin clear and healthy af or is it just me?
Imagine if a random hammer company steals clips of her using the hammer as advertisement 💀💀
She is going through a nail crisis
cristine i’ve been watching ur videos since fourth grade and i’m in 9th grade... you could say i’m a little obsessed lmao
Its not spanish, it's brazilian portuguese. Gringa refers to a foreign female and its not mean or anything like that, it's just a slang
Go Christine YAS
Yes!! Spill the tea!!
HER HAIR IS STRAIGHT THIS MUST MEAN SOMETHING
CHRISTMAS VIDEOS NEXT PLEASE AND MAYBE EVERY WEEK UNTIL CHRISTMAS
OMG 18 minutes ago kinda early i love you cristine
It's not Spanish... it's portuguse
Haha it’s not Spanish it’s Portuguese 🤣
Loving the multichrome? Mallet lol
Holo Cristine!! 😂 "Gringa" is a way to say to people from the USA. Mostly at Mexico, as for when we [Mexico] were invaded by the USA, the army and civilians would chant "Green go home", for green was the color of the USA army. And that's how it has become a way of calling "gringos". It's kind of mean 😂 but it's part of our relationship with the USA. (Ps. That is the story that's told, may be it has a different origin but I don't know 😂).
Cristine that is NOT spanish hahahaha it's portuguese. This is an ad from Brasil and we speak portuguese
So when is the mallet coming out on holo taco
its not spanish cristineeee  thats portuguese its what brazilians speak
The last time I was this early she was making a nail polish cake
I talk spanish but the spanish from Spain or Latin America not the spanish that is in the video and gringas Is the tortilla with the cheese and meat and a lot of things and gringa is someone that talks spanish but I don't really know what gringas mean in the spanish in the video
Just report them on copyright issue option
The people that disliked are the people who stole your footage 👀
And in every new video it looks like your nail polish shelf is growing 🤣
I just realised there are holo taco stickers on the hammer😂
The dislikes r the companys
Cristine is just jealous of her old self that actually did her nails Im just kidding I love u simply I think that using someone elses nails for money And also can we applaud simply on her hair that was down this video
In the cases of the nail salon, they don't personally print out your thumbnail. I worked for one and they get all their promotional posters from the same nail supply company, the supplier is at fault, the salon probably doesn't even know who you are.
Watch this video be copyrighted by so many nail companies because you showed their ads. Lol.
If anyone wants to know what the text says in 7:33   " This is what latest nail art technology reached , it'a a printer that paints any picture from your phone onto your nails , in only 35 seconds! Only in ...(I'm not sure the countries name in english 😅)"   You're welcome😂
I think you should chop off your hair and donate it so you don’t still have some dyed hair at the bottom and you can have all virgin hair😊I think it would look so good on you!
Gringa basically means white girl in that sceniro
6:36 cristine reading Brazilian Portuguese as Spanish Bro I'm cracking up
FUCKING YEAH ive been waiting for this video since nikkie dropped her video
I love the pillows in the back
6:20 THAT'S NOT SPANISH CRISTINE THAT'S PORTUGUESE, IT HAD "BRASIL" IN IT  And also, gringa is not necessarily mean. In this case specifically it's more of a hype up, because brazilians love some gringa trends.
Yes Gringa is for white girl
You should make a video were you actually try these products out! ✨
✨Simply court✨ she may break her table with that mallet but oh well 😀
Cristine mistaking Portuguese with Spanish and trying to figure it out any way 😂😂🧡
I love how they left the question mark, dip powder nails? Maybe we have them, who knows
I think Tati also made a video like this
6:21 it is portuguese. Why am I like this...
This is early for me but it’s 20 min late :( ☹️
I think it was in Portuguese 7:19
Not to get off subject, but Cristine needs to do a video of her doing watermarbling her nails anyway she wants using her Holo Taco products and I don't know if she has it, but she should have her own Holo Taco cuticle oil. I thought of that as I was putting cuticle oil on my own nails.
This is why Cristine works in crime
Also 7:11 when we call outsiders gringos it isnt really supposed to be mean. It just depends on the context. Like who you say it to or how you say it, etc
CRISTINE WEARING HER HAIR DOWN MAKES ME SO HAPPY FOR WHATEVER REASON SHES LIKE THE PRETTIEST
I’m so early why am I so earlyI’m not mad about it I love your videos either way I’m actually pretty happy that I’m early
I have seen a lot of ads that have your nails and I was like "tf is this? " and knew that THIS was coming
6:23 It's not Spanish, it's Portuguese, and it says something along the lines of "New hot trend with the foreign ladies" which is hilarious to me  Edit: I didn't watch the rest hahaha Gringa is not an offensive term here in Brazil, just slang for "foreign"
I believe the message that says “entre as..” is not spanish
“Order in the court” SHE SAID PERIODT
I just wanna know how much time did she spend straightening her hair🤔🤔🤔
Please please please try the holo chocolate from how to cook that with ann reardon    https://youtu.be/6p3T_KHbfhs  Edit: incorrect name spelling
u know it's serious when cris got her hair down
U should donate some of your hair
but this isn't spanish :(
Did you see the holographic chocolate video???? https://youtu.be/yhmCRliJ93w  simply science needed
It's always important to have a tea break when you're spilling the tea!
Don’t worry, “gringos” and “gringas” are... ok 😂😂😂😂 (says a mexican)
Early
I haven't watched the video yet but I am very ready 🥴
I love you Cristine, but it wasn't spanish, I think it's protuguese... maybe 😂😂
hiiiiii

Cristine: i can't read spanish Me: well Cristine, that's portuguese
Cristine in case you didn't know they speak Portuguese in Brazil.
Christineeee i know you probably wont see this , but I got my first holiday nails polish! Its a purple holo
Portuguese! Not Spanish, Cristine!
Heyyyyyyy!!!!
Cristine, that brand on 6:20 is actually from Brazil and the writing is in Portuguese! It is a polygel nails kit to do at home
How the grinch/brands  Stole christine's nails
I’m suinggggggggggggggggg🤡
Well that hurt on many levels XD Ye that aint spanish xD it even says brasil! TvT
It wasn't Spanish!!! It was Portuguese from Brazil! It's a Brazilian company.
Even the Holo betrays you.
Omg i just found out I was early
That video is actually in portuguese, and 'gringa' means foreign women. nothing bad
Whenever anyone spots a fake simply, report it on that platform. Get those thieves 💪
Hey I'm early and thank gosh Cristine is now greatly ok❤️
I'm so proud of you for doing this and calling them out! Good on you girl! Xx 🤣😂🤣😂( I LOVE THAT BEN'S NAILS EVEN GOT IN A FAKE POST! AND HIS PHOTO!)🤣🤣🤣🤣🦄🦄🦄🦄💓💓💜💜💗💗
GRINGO MEANS FOREIGNER, IT'S NOT MEAN! It's literally anyone that's not from Latin America, regardless of race.
6:15 SIMPLY thats not spanish its portuguese!!!!!! the audacity... love you!
I kinda wanna see Cristine react to troom troom’s  old videos because strangely they are normal
you are late
its not spanish at 6:10 .. please dont be the tipical american/canadian who thinks that all languages are the same except for english.. lmao
so much i see your videos i start talking like you 😂😂
Like so many companies use things from other people without permession also have and idea for s video you should create polish mount again
Which color is on her left hand?
When Cristine googles gringa 😂
I love your videos, hi from Spain!!!!!❤
"I can't read spanish" lol
That's not spanish girl... That's portuguese 🤣🤣🤣
Is it just me.. that think the thumbnail was Jen? 😀
YouTube post notifications don't work I was notified 14 minutes after the vid was posted 🤦🏾‍♀️

How dare ben not bring you tea in this video😱😱
6:17 * sad portuguese noises *
Nobody parts are safe here-
No cat ears? Oh she mad, mad.
YOURE hair locs evry cool
Can't wait until Holo Taco starts selling that nail oil pen 👀👀👀
"A nova febre entre as gringas" = the new fever among foreigners. I think they just wanted the clip of Cristine saying Oh My Gosh to show, you know, a foreigner being impressed. Plus Brazil -> portuguese, close to spanish but not the same ;)
You’re hair looks great in this video!
15 minutes ago? Cool.
now waiting for holo taco rubber mallet merch
Lol a small incidence...   Last year, I made a business studies project in which we had to show the whole manufacture to sale to advertising of 1 product... Any product... I got to do the project on highlighter... And the way I am obsessed with Simply and the booty gooru she is, *SHE WAS MY BRAND AMBASSADOR LOL!!!* like Literally, I searched a photo of her wearing highlighter, and put that in my file and labelled it *"brand ambassador- Cristine rotenburg"* lol... 😂  Cristine dont sue me... It was just a class 11 project who no one except my teacher is going to see 😳😳
the second category, it's in Portuguese, not Spanish!
The table after this video: *people always ask if i’m okay and i lie because i’m not okay*
6:18 when she said Spanish instead of Portuguese it killed me lmao
Is not spanish is Portuguese.
Not Spanish, Cristine. It's Brazilian Portuguese 😂
6:12 it is not Spanish.... it’s Portuguese why does so much people think it’s Spanish?? It’s just Ignorance...I am Portuguese and I do recognize many languages. Portuguese and Spanish are very different
"I have no idea what's being written because I can't read spanish" hahaha that's portuguese!
GO AHEAD
one can be a gringx and not be white tho
Earliest I've ever been on a simply video!
Omg so early
simply lawyerlogical
The two meanings of gringa are correct.In México, at least.
6:20 lol it's not spanish Cristine, its brazilian portuguese 😂 " A nova febre entre as gringas " can be translated to " the new hottest trend between 'gringas'  Gringa it's a slang used here in Latin America ( I'm from Brazil) to refer to foreign girls, especially the ones who live in north America. :)
Early
cristine: i don't speak Spanish the add: *it's clearly in portuguese*
Brands : Let’s steal dis content 😗✌🏻  Cristine :   honey, you got a big storm coming
This commercial that appears  your face, are playing here in Brazil, the translation is: "The new fever among foreigners" they use "GRINGA" is a slang .. means "FOREIGNERS"
Here a ticket before the 1 million views:🎫
It's simply scandalous!
The clip at the minute 7:30 it is in Arabic Language and it say ‘The new technology for nail art , a printer that prints any photo you want from your phone in 35 sec ‘
Broooo, finally!! But PS: You should totally make a Holo Taco color called Benana, just for the best tea slave(lol)
Ur hair so pretty❤️❤️
that was portuguese, not spanish i am tired of this slanter against my language 😭😭
“A nova febre entre as gringas” means the newest/hottest trend among (female) foreigners. It’s not offence, it’s just slang for people not born/from Latin America. Also, that’s Portuguese not Spanish. Hope that clears things up 😁
The majority of the spanish speakers (I speak Spanish) use gringa or gringos as a mean term for the white people...  I look white and im called that often in my family so .. Yes.
THIS SO FUNNY XD
alternate title: cristine spills the tea☕️
Lmao that ad was in Portuguese 💀 but yes it says “a new trend among gringas” (essentially American women)
Lol yes I was waiting for a vid like this!  SimplyCourtLogical!  SimplyArrestlogical!!! Wooo!
when i saw the ad say “gringa” i started dying laughing😭😭
6:50 the add is in Portuguese from Brazil;  Gringa means girls  edit: I comment to soonnnnn 7:23---> YES
i stan Simply Nail-LAW-gical
That's portuguese not spanish hahaha
I straight up didn't recognize her because her hair is down
The multi chrome face one makes you looks like a citizen at the capital of Panem haha
SOMEONE GET THIS WOMAN A HOLO GAVEL
love uuuuu
Cristine: Shows a brazilian ad in portuguese  Also Cristine: I can't read spanish   Just for you to know, here in Brazil we DON'T speak spanish, only portuguese. :'(
It's in Portuguese, not Spanish hahaha. And yeah, gringa it's kinda demeaning most of the time, but in this case it's like, gringas always have the best products, so "look the new hot nail polish they are using! Buy here!"
THE MALLET AHAHA
I'm definitely not first  I'm definitely not last  but when simplynailogical post  I sure do click fast
So whos down for hunting down these users with torches and pitchforks?
Cristine that's not Spanish it's Portuguese adkjadkjasdka  it just says that you can do this type of gel nails at home and that they last up to 20 days!!! usually gringo/a is a (kinda............) despective term to talk about Americans - I'm not sure if about Canadians too actually!
The thing is, you can't really win. They use your beautiful pictures for sells, or they use you taking offense for publicity (because any is better than none). Either way, they get what they want.
Simply lawsuit
"No body part is safe" is going to be the next Cristine clip to be used out of context on Tiktok. Calling it now.
at 6:06 the ad is in brazilian portuguese, Cristine, not spanish!!
i just wanted to point out that the language was portuguese, not spanish! gringo/a can be used as a mean word but usually it just means someone from the usa/north america
Lol a small incidence...   Last year, I made a business studies project in which we had to show the whole manufacture to sale to advertising of 1 product... Any product... I got to do the project on highlighter... And the way I am obsessed with Simply and the booty gooru she is, *SHE WAS MY BRAND AMBASSADOR LOL!!!* like Literally, I searched a photo of her wearing highlighter, and put that in my file and labelled it *"brand ambassador- Cristine rotenburg"* lol... 😂  Cristine dont sue me... It was just a class 11 project who no one except my teacher is going to see 😳😳
Woah I went from cold cases to this
Why did you stop watermarking your vids tho? It's important to do so, even more seeing this vid 😂
Earlyyyyyy
dip powder nails? is not even a good advertisement.  do you have the powder or not?  we don’t know.
the dislikes are from the companies being caught using christines stuff....... shame on them lol
WE👏NEED👏COLOURFUL👏NO-BITE👏POLISH
Lol the message from the false nails adhesive was not in Spanish, but Portuguese. As a Spanish speaker it always makes me laugh when people confuse these two languages XD
6:12 that ain't even spanish that's portuguese😭
Hewo 🥺
Quirky Fun Fact: Everyone commenting has not even watched the whole video yet... Including me
maybe christine should end her youtube career and become a part time judge😌
"Gringa" is a kind of food here in Mexico, also we call "Gringa/o" to the American people, no offense lol
Simply Judge Judy and Executioner 😤
Yeeeees get em Simply!
Lol the gringo part Cristine you translated good
I actually bought one of the oil pens Cristine use this week and i am loving it

06:45 both definitions are correct, but the UD one is used everywhere in Latin America, and not just in Mexico to name a food. Edit: Isn’t that Portuguese?
Cristine do wanna play Among Us? I really want to see your playing with Ben,Saf,Tyler and ThreadBanger!!!
I love you Christine!!

Gavel, rubber mallet, same diff right?
Honestly, my favorite thing to do is when I see ads on Facebook or Instagram, is to call them out in the comments and link to the original video or image. It's actually worked for a few of them.
Can't believe I'm here so early in the comment section ❤
Sup
How to know you've really made it in the Beauty Community... people start taking your content to sell their stuff. You've got to be stupid to steal from someone who is so well known or even just have any number of fans in general. They almost always start asking questions, especially with YouTubers who have to be very open about such things in their videos...
Love this! Been in the working for years!!! Lol
Wow she did something with her hair! We haven't seen her hair down since her haircut video
last time i was this early, companies didn't use Cristine's face/nails without her permission.
She's back
In Mexico we use the word Gringa or Gringo, to refer to a person who lives in the USA ... and it is also a kind of taco
They steal our faces, but more importantly NAILS!
These companies are stinky.
HOLY IM EARLY! AMAZING VIDEO CRISTINE
Yo simply snapped 💁🏻‍♀️
ahh your hair is very pretty!
Also always miss out on your boxed polishes 😮😫😫
YESSS QUEEN CALL THEM OUTT
Hi
i can smell the tea brewing
That is Portuguese, not Spanish...
Get em! Lol
Seven minutes ago bro I’m early
OMG IM EARLY :D
You know it's serious when Cristine does a video with her hair down
I’m so early! Hi I love you so much holo
I love her hair
Never been so early LMFAOAOOAOAOA
cristine has her hair down and not in her cinnamon bunn
Being early is odd but satisfying. It feels so wrong yet so right.
simply the detective on the case  Cristine with no H: MY ASSISTANT HELP GIVE ME THE BINDERS assistant: meow Cristine with no H: MENCHIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
My nails aren't growing at all even though I oil it idk what to do its really breakable when I shower it's bendable so I paint them so it doesn't break lol   Looking for help   And sorry for my bad English
Lol a small incidence... Last year, I made a business studies project in which we had to show the whole manufacture to sale to advertising of 1 product... Any product... I got to do the project on highlighter... And the way I am obsessed with Simply and the booty gooru she is, *SHE WAS MY BRAND AMBASSADOR LOL!!!* like Literally, I searched a photo of her wearing highlighter, and put that in my file and labelled it *"brand ambassador- Cristine rotenburg"* lol... Cristine dont sue me... It was just a class 11 project who no one except my teacher is going to see lol
Ma'am, that's portuguese not spanish
Lmao 622nd
Wow how am I so early Maybe it's becuz she's being so extra awesome today
I'm hereeeeee
Hi
The holo tea has been SERVED- 🍵☕💿
I want the subscribe button to be holo💿💿💿
Hey hey holo... my god girl... I love your channel. Had my own salon for 12 years and love watching your channels. Hope your feeling better xx
Did she stick the holo taco brand logo on the hammer 😂
Cristine always looks gorgeous but she just looks like such a goddess in this vid omg
Ohhhh court room time
Cristine your hair looks so good!
i miss cristine so much 😍
I hate that this happens to YouTubers
When you get to the video early enough to report all of the spam
The most early I can be is 7 minutes :O
OMG There was a brazilian AD
No one Literally nobody Cristine:  What’s next?!? My feet?!? Are you going to use my feet to sell socks?!?!?!?
my nightshift proves to be very useful since i'll be early for this upload 😌
YES CRISTINE TELL THEM💅🏽💅🏽
About time
_Me here for the Simply Cris-Tea-ne like:_ 😲🍵👌💿
Who got an ad of a stupid nail game (water marbling) mid-video? Too on the nose, YT Ads!
Basically the only time we can assume Simply gave permission to use her nails is if they're holding a cup of David's Tea
Oh cristine... they wouldnt go after your feet. Theyd go after your hair.
pretend this comment is funny
Cristine is such a gorgeous woman, especially with her hair down, if I don't look as good as her at 30 I'm gonna be jealous
Tem até print de um artigo em português Ahhhhhhhhh kkkkkkkk
Only two minutes in and I think this is the most savage video Cristine has ever uploaded
https://youtu.be/6p3T_KHbfhs Edible holo chocolate for the holo queen

Hey Cristine how are u doing with your health hope your well❤️
Your hair looks amazing today!!!!! What’s different? Also - posting at the same time as thread banger was a hard choice 🤣
The 5 people who clicked in to dislike are probably TroomTroom employees.
I've been waiting for this more than Ben has been wanting a vacantion
They didn't even bother covering up her water mark properly in some. Smh.
So early! I was waiting for this video cuz. Love you Simply. Can you check your snapchat messages because I have messaged you there because I can't mail you stuff. This is my name Bhoomika Rathod 💙
For some reason I thought somebody stole her bag of peeled off nails
Whooo early

Judge simply
Hahaha, binders of affidavits.
Cristine: smacks the table with the mallet   The table: what did I ever do to deserve this? I held your nail polish spills, put up with the messes you’ve made, spilled your milk and tea on me, and had your cats walk all over me.....  But to be honest, the table broke her nail 3 years ago.
AYEEEEEE early for once
I’m early love you!
Yassss spill that tea
JUDGE CRISTINE IN THE COURT. NOW IN SESSION!
Am i the only one who thinks that Cristine's hair looks so nice in this video? Like extra smooth and shiny 🥰what did you do to them sis?
I've never been this early🥺 but Ms. Logical thank you for ur content🖤 you got me to stop biting my nails 💅

Who else think she should recreate random nails from her peely bag but she is not aloud to use nail tools or vinyls.
Lol you know this ones gonna be good when simply’s hair is down
SUE ‘EM ALL!!!

Honestly wish people didnt have to make these videos but im glad that when this happens they do!
I’m putting “simply detective” on my resume now
I love how delightfully topical this is. Affidavits 😂 Fraudulent activity... 😂😂
and can we talk about cristines hair😍
All the beauty bloggers with their “receipts” really just need Gift Receipt by Holo Taco
please dont feel like the binders joke went unnoticed because I had to pause the video because I was laughing too hard
Christine: pretends to be A judge Me: oh no no no that’s my money right there, I’ll see you in court!     What you do if somebody had made 💰 from your photos?
Lmfao go off queen
It’s Simply Lawgical      I’ll go home
Brands: use Cristines’s nails without her permission  Cristine after this video: ItS NoT A PrOBELm AnYmOre 🥴
A message to these companies                     DONT MESS WITH SIMPLY
