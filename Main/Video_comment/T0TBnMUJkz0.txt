Forest going down 😂😂😂
NAVAS dive is so f delayed
This is premier League!
The commentator called Meslier sommelier after the Forest goal
👍🏻
Better from Leeds. Now they need another 9 points
Sinisterra has a contender for goal of the week what a shot and goal by him
Relegation scrap gets tighter 😶😤
hardly a stunner
That's a good goal but not a STUNNER!
Ive been a LUFC FAN since.....1972......i play golf with DUNCAN MCKENZIE......PLEASE  PLEASE ....PRAY FOR LEEDS SURVIVAL IN THE PREMIERSHIP.......A SLEEPING GIANT TEAM
Yoo my home town making me proud lesss gooo 🎉
It’s only just crossed my mind that Navas could go from being a PSG champions league number 1 to a championship player in less than 2 years
Nice to hear Lee Mack co-commentating.
I have been a football fan for 56 years. Trust me, the teams with the worst goal difference always seem to get relegated, sorry to Forest fans!
First time I saw him was in feyernood final last season and I instantly said he was a player
That 1 fan who shouted shoot before he scored 😂😂
Second goal from sinisterrra  was brilliant
Navas could have done better with the first, but tbh forgive him because he basically won Forest the game v Leeds a few months ago
"fires ___ out of drop zone!" is saving Sky Sports titles this season
Never seen a goalkeeper like naval who dives and stays in the same spot it’s remarkable he is too good for pub side tree huggers still
As a United fan I’d love that Columbian winger over Anthony every day of the weeek someone who just wants to commit defenders great game this was to watch 👌🏼
is there a worst striker on the pitch in prem league than Bamford? maybe evertons maupay at the minute but other than them?!
Mckennie really didn't seem bothered for the first Leeds goal. Sad to see
Where tuff for the Leeds goal might as well be in the away end
That's like a 6 pointer that
Decent finish but hardly a “stunner”.
Leeds have goals, I think they'll be fine.
Great win for Leeds We are improving and have great options in most areas  I Know he is club captain but we look better when Cooper is on the bench MOT FOREVER
Massive Massive 3pts. Perm any 3 from Palace down for the drop.
Ayling and Bamford weakest link in the team.
Sini is a good player but we we warned he is injury prone so was always a risky signing
Regelation games are always fun to watch
Luke Ayling has cause so much trouble for Leeds this season and last season. He is Not a full back and everyone knows that. He has been caught out so many times. He needs to be dropped and Leeds need to tightened up at the back.
Great game
I am a Nottingham Forest fan and we are playing S#!?. We cant keep simple passes going for over 2 minutes. We love to just kick the ball up field and expect johnson or some else to pick the ball up. Its like We are a bunch of new players thats only just started played football in the last week. There is no way we will be staying up. And I don't blame Cooper because it's the players on the pitch that kicks the ball  around with no passing skills.
Great to have sini back. Superb player been so unlucky with injuries since he joined us. Excited to see him and gnonto fit at the same time!
Do a is playing well for the new Spanish manager.
I saw that Forest were wearing some random kit, and stopped watching. Why are we letting kit makers destory football heritage, identity and character in the UK. TV companies, kit makers want one team in White and one in Black - nice and cheap to produce.
forest going down
There was nothing sinister about that.
Absolutely rubbish,cooper hasn’t got a clue in the prem league.i don’t care what he’s done in the past it’s know what counts.get or championship.
Can't believe I missed that Sinnisterra goal because I was getting my phone out to record 😂😢
How Harrison has never had a look in for England I'll never understand, he's far more consistent than some of the dead wood Southgate keeps on picking.
Neco Williams had a shocker all game
Easily the worst team to come to Elland Road. Southampton and Forest are down 100%. Now it's between the rest.
What is it with Colombian Lw's the passion pace and skill is amazing, can't wait till lucho is back from injury, Leeds you have got a baller there in sinisterra
Easily predicted win💰💰
Embarrassing forest, glad they’re going down.
Great atmosphere for the 6 pointer
Again Forest missing out on vital points absolutely terrible
I love watching forest loose🤣
I've been saying for month's, I still think forest will do down and will soon slip to the bottom 3
saw the match was surprised how forest seemed to give up last 30 mins , Harrison sinesterra  Roca struch great today   not sure why Bamford was left on for so long its obvious to anyone  whos seen him before his injury hes struggling mentally and phisically
I think Leeds need a new striker next season. Bamford just isn't Prem quality.
Who knew Roca was such a baller, second half he was tremendous. Best game he's had for us. Hate to say it but the Ref was completely competent too🙄
Just awesome.  Keep it up boys !
I’d sack the squad before Cooper and play the U21s
Take your prayer mats Saturday lads 👍
Bye Bye Notts Forest.
Big mistake by Forest for not wearing their red kit
Can't remember seeing a relegation battle this close with 8 teams separated by only 7 points, and also all somehow on 23+. Normally there's at least one team below 20, but not this season...
That defender face at the end tho🤣🤣🤣
Sky are so crap with picture quality/transmission ...noticably inferior to La Liga and Serie A picture quality .. Whats the point in spending billions on broadcast rights and economise on the cameras and broadcast quality?  Oh and its LEEDS UNITED ..that's  their PROPER name , not just the foreshortend LEEDS...please ALWAYS refer to them by their proper name in future ...it's accurate and authentic. Sky are philistines.
Ay Ay We Got Sinistera  Ay Ay Baller from Colombia  Ay Ay Better than Diaz any day
That looked like a Bamford handball to me.
Sell bamford even if they don't beat the drop , 1 season wonder in the top flight . Leed's miss a poacher .
Sinisterra STUNNER fires Leeds out of drop zone! 💥 | Leeds 2-1 Nottingham Forest | PL Highlights  022am  5.4.23 look at that..............one day after paying my bills and i'm skint!!!!
Probably the most entertaining season of PL for a minute! So much going on 😄
If we had a full squad all season we would be well safe now
Proper Forest used to play in red !  Going down kit?
Forest could be in trouble now
Marc roca and McKennie were unreal this evening. Totally bossed the game. McKennie has a lot of class about him and roca was next level tonight  on and off the ball
bamford over rated clown loan him to frickley athletic
In what world is that a stunner ?
SCUM LEEDS &  DIRTY PLACE
I hope the Forest owner don't pull the trigger on Steve Cooper as literally anyone in the bottom 8 can go down so you may be in the bottom 3 till the last game of the season yet still be able to stay up.
The Colombian Diaz 🇨🇴🇨🇴🇨🇴
Forest are looking more and more doomed every week, sad to see really, lovely club from a beautiful city the jewel of the Midlands.
Navas thinking he's in the prem 🤣 but gonna be in the championship
Sinister shot nothing that Kilo Navas can do about that 🤣🤣🤣
This season relegation battle is one of the best.
*DONT SACK COOPER!!!*
Insane = Premier League
Terrible defending from Leeds for the first goal ,If they took their chances they'd have won 3 or 4 nil
I honestly have no idea whos gonna get relegated and we haven't had that for what feels like a decade
Well deserved Leeds, get in there MOT 💛💙💛💙💛
Massive result for Leeds. Absolutely massive!
Imagine being a defender and NOT showing someone down the outside. "By all means, sir, cut inside and curve it beautifully into the corner"🤡
Leeds might survive again🤣
Navas positioning is awful
What a second goal for Leeds United
Big up the Leeds United!
Sinisterra looking like Vinicius Jr Jr
Taxi for Cooper..👍
Jeezus, we need points asap
some finish that from sinisterra, been balling when hes healthy
Forest are a 1 man team ( Johnson )... and he was rattled today.
Sinisterra''s terrific strike should be a contender for Goal of the Month on 'Match of the Day'!
Hard fought victory LEEDS a massive win come on Leeds stay focused another big Match against the Eagles on Sunday whole team played for the shirt excellent goal by Sinni All Leeds aren't we 🦚🇮🇨👊✊
Massive 3 points tonight, another 3 on Sunday against Palace 🤞🤞🤞
Has Bamford had a shot on target this season yet?
Hopefully they still find a way to go down. Awful football club.
That Sinisterra seems a better winger than Anthony at United.
How crap must you be, you only beat us by one.
I know I’m supposed to hate Leeds, but they’re my absolute favourite team to watch as a neutral. I so hope they stay up this year
You have Wingers, so use them, Jesse Marsch.
🎵Sacked in the morning, Cooper you will be sacked in the morning🎵
LEEDS LEEDS LEEDS
Nottingham Forest are truly falling apart.
Jack Harrison has been on fire since Gracia's arrival MOT ALAW
Bye bye cooper
Big performance tonight  , Elland Road is bubbbbling once again
Sinnesterra off the left is naughty  Alaw
amount of chances we had tonight we should have put Robin Hood to sleep big 3 points
Loved how Jack held his line to stay onside for his goal
Whats bamford doin ????
Roca had an excellent game today for Leeds, happy to get the three points today.
I question what we learn in training, think the defence know how to defend 😂 ayling gets left for dead and is far to slow for this division, without wober that defence falls apart never the less vital 3 points against relegation opposition and 10 points from last 6 is better than we were doing in Gracia I believe!
Struijk makes a viking shield wall look small lol MOT 🛡️😁
Bit of an average goal to be calling a stunner tbh
Awful goalkeeping from Navas for Leed's first.
I’d like to throttle ayling wish he’d just boot it up the pitch his mistakes are becoming too often for me
We only win when we end up in the drop zone... the threat of relegation is real bad
Bye Bye nottingham, you're insane luck as ran out, to the drop zone you go
Can Bamfail just go back to championship and leave Leeds Utd alone in the premier league pls.
For a second after reading the title I thought a Green Lantern was playing for Leeds!
Forest have been winning their last 2 games, to come away with just 1 point from them is why they’re where they are
As a Forest fan: well done Leeds, you were much the better team. But then again, every team is better than us so don't feel too special :)
Thouight Harrison had one of his best games this season so far.
Sinisterra the Sicario,  This kid is an Assassin.
Kinda feel for forest as they gave Arsenal their first kit
We need Aurier back. Williams has cost us 2 goals in games. He's too easy to get past. It's either he's caught ball watching and gets done by a ball over the top or someone coming back on their right foot. He's now being targeted for this.
The Irish guy is getting even more nervous about Leeds.
Such a big win. Really need to beat Palace too as the run in is tasty
Javi has won 10 points from 4 games. Only lost against arsenal.
Sinisterra’s goal was everything 🤌
Love other fans supporting are çlub love to see it i knew we was all Leeds haha 🎉
Will be a miracle if we stay up now considering all the crap we've signed over the last 2 windows. Fullbacks at fault tonight unfortunately. Not sure why we're not making full use of Lodi given that he is our best LB but I'm guessing the plan is to give Toffolo some game time as he will likely be our go to LB if we're back in the Champ next season. Also we are yet to win a game that Dennis has started, he tries hard but is ultimately a liability.
Leeds will stay up and I reckon they will challenge for Europe Next season, not based on anything, just pure gut feeling
Yaaaaaaaasssss! Thank god Senior Firpo has stopped drinking Milk 😂 MOT
Thank you for all you did Steve Cooper

Bamford back to his missed guilt edged  chances best..... 🤣🤣
Watch forest beat utd Liverpool and villa now and then get battered by Southampton 😂
Where's your famous atmos...... Oh wait 🤣
Bamford the worst striker in the league
After that hiding from Arsenal shows real character, fight and desire from Leeds. To be fair though, all the teams at the bottom are not going without a *FIGHT* best of *LUCK* in the big *fight* to stay in the *BEST LEAGUE IN THE WORLD* *EDIT* Never *Give up*  *Premier is the best* Hands down…..
Bamford can't hit a barn door
I really hope Leeds stay up, they're such a great club to have in the prem and I think most have a soft spot for them 😂
Great all round team performance tonight! 👏  Harrison & Sinisterra gave their defence nightmares, Struijk was immense at the back!! Should've won by more than 2-1, but 3 pts is what's important!!  On & On!! 💙🤍💛
massive 3 points for us
Most underrated premier league season in a while. 9 teams in a relegation battle, one week ur bottom, the next your 14th. Incredible race for Europe and Champions League. United, spurs, Newcastle, Brighton, Brentford, villa,Liverpool. And then the title race between city and arsenal. What a season!
Cooper out
1 Cup Final won, onto Palace, I'm ecstatic, Struijk, Sini and Mckennie Excellent MOT ALAW
Leeds Leeds Leeds were goons sing for Leeds united
Move on to palace now come on you leeds
Thank you leeds for helping my bournemouth team forrest are doomed they have such a hard run in left they going down with Southampton and Leicester buzzing come on bournemouth get in!!!! Red army
Bamford a couple of seasons ago was bagging goals week in week out now can’t even hit the target from 10yards out
Forest fan here. I think we're doomed. Our recent form has been atrocious. Dyche is getting things going at Everton, and Leeds are improving. I think we'll go with Southampton and Bournemouth.
Nottingham Forest once had a dog walking business. It didn’t last long as they can’t hold on to Leeds.
Sinisterra an absolute baller. What a goal from him and hopefully can provide more to keep Leeds up.
What a win for Leeds, and what a goal by Sinisterra🔥🔥🔥
"We all hate Leeds scum" ❤❤ get in!!!! Forest are the worst team to play at ellend Road this season
360p.
Goal of the season contender
Wonderful strike to put Leeds out on bottom 3 in epl
why is harrison on thumbnail when title is sinesterra
Brilliant goal, can’t wait to see what he has to bring to the prem
360p gang 💪
leeds at the end of the season in the relegation battle, they can pull of something amazing
MASSIVE WIN 🇮🇨
