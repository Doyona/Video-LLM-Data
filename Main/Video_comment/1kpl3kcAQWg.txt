HUGE Thank you to you, Jeff! Much love from the LTT team. -CW
watching this 3.5 years later, the masks didnt age well
This is the video which made me discover your channel back in the days .
nice.,
the mask ☠☠☠☠
I know it’s a bit late but I came here from a belated watch on LTT. New sub for sure!
lttstore😂
I belive linus should've not given this man a new PC he seems like he should need to stay away from gaming for the next 20 years and just work out...
What camera is that?
Talent was my home town. I spent 18 years of my life there. Spencer was a class below me in high school. Congrats on the new PC bro.
that smol intel bot is so cute ;)
Ran across the build of this PC on LTT so came here to watch and subscribe
More than a year anniversary of this video. So great of you and LTT to collaborate. Since it was a little jarring to not have a Craft Beer suggested I have one instead. Franziskaner Hefe-Weiss. Goes well with German food especially during Oktoberfest.
Great work! Kudos to LTT & Craft Computing!
Kinda hurt to watch him lay it down screen first of the desk lol
Spencer didn't have the reaction I was expecting
Youre the ethan McMullen of pc tube
Cut the bass on that car ride. My subs were roaring during all that. Mad respect tho ❤️
i betcha hes a discord mod
water bottle add for ltt lmao wasnt expecting that
Good for him, congrats.  That's some shitty luck in general.
oh shit. this was alameda fire, i evacced from that fire. god be willing that he has a safe and speedy recovery, and that all who lost homes or loved ones recover just as well
no offence but rust players be like:
the last this guy needs is a computer. needs a gym membership
thank for giving my faith on humanity
that was really cool of you guys ^^
I literally live a mile from Spencer
Not to be rude but ima be rude.  Damn it’s a Reddit mod
even the wildfire knows to not fuck with grandmas
woohoo thats awesome
Now that's a reddit user
The "Do you think it'll run TF2?" question immediately put a huge smile on my face!
"its funny, LTT said it had a 2080 Super, but it does not have it, it has a 2070 and oddly I suddenly have a 2080 super, funny old world"
Weird thing that he now have a extremely similar build to me, same CPU, same PSU, same GPU, same RAM, same SSD, same fans, same Screen, same keybord. Its a very cool thing yo offer him a new PC btw !
Very cool, though I wouldn't have used the fire singed mounting brackets.  It may be small, but why risk a potential failure.
You mean rtx 3090 super
this was the first video I watched by Jeff(or is it spelled, Geoff!?)... it started a huge thing...love all of the videos my man!
Spencer seems like an awesome guy but it’s seriously such a shame that he went through that, i hope that doesn’t happen again in the future
I cheered at the LTT store plug
damn i wish my computer burned too and post it on reddit and ltt would give me a new one
I would have liked this video until you made to "that's what she said" joke. So please be mature about what you say so ppl can watch the video peacefully
wholesome
that's a thick as boy
I know I’m late to this video, but as an Australian 🇦🇺 We had the entire country ablaze in mid-late 2019 through till in the second quarter of 2020 (we had about 8-9 months of continuous extreme fires) and we luckily didn’t witness many deaths, although we lost countless wildlife, farmlands and bush lands/forrests and a nation which regularly faces extreme summer fires etc, I feel for the people and donated to a US based charity and fire service as many of you did during our bushfire which smoke affected many nations and continents around the world. It’s nice to see the true generosity of strangers 🥳🎉👍😎😉🤯🥳🇦🇺and the decency of fellow man during extreme times of struggle and heartache 😞. It’s a shame that a small few try to also profit & / or pillage & scam as well 😡🤬! Great video to watch and small acts, not of this scale can make a tremendous difference to those who truely need it 🥰🥰❤️❤️🎉🎉😉
thank you sir. it certainly made him happy and thats good. thank you !
The old mounting brackets being used is the coolest part to me
Both heart breaking and heart warming. Thanks for sharing
Mental to see how much damage was caused and how many life's damaged mentally and physically. It's nice to see a gamer back up to being able to have some normality in his life again. but that being said I bet him and his family are happy about having some financial strain lifted from this fire, end of the day that pc is worth a few $K, linus deffo made an impact here and obviously thank you craft for showing the damaged area and him getting the pc, brings life into the story.
I just saw this video this is awsome living in grants pass oregon i understand the devistation of this.
The way he wore the mask tho 😂
At 5:15 is Sexton pass, and the Hugo exit is where I turn off to go home, or the Merlin exit. So cool to see my roads in a big channel!
I'm from southern Oregon too, and recognize alot of these roads!
Wait Linus said he lived at the end of the road not 3 hrs away😀😀😀😀
Yo we live like 50 miles apart.
He looks exactly like a reddit gamer
I love how he get impressed for little things xd like the fan colors and the water bottle
Win win situation.
Eyyy i've been there!! (Salem that is, It's beautiful there!)
TF2 MY MAN!!!!!!!!
yeah i live just up the road    185 miles later...   yup just up the road
As a fellow PNW resident. This makes me happy to see
I'm late to the party but I'll sub for the 360 mile round trip off to help some stranger on the internet who needed help.  Bought tears to my eyes to see how happy he was with it.
Glad the kid got a new rig.
Very awesome!!!  Love watching your channel.  As a survivor of the Camp Fire a few years back in Northern California I can say from experience that kindness like this is huge and it goes a long way to trying to get back to normal when people reach out and give a helping hand. 👍👍👍
Excellent video, love the music, and the generous gift of sweet gaming rig.
I like your mask. Where did you get it?
yea JUST up the road
Masks are unhealthy for you and dont provide protection 🤷‍♂️ stop following and start leading 💪
the newset edition of the oregon trail ? :D
after a car part i ordered was delivered to a car dealership instead of to my house i decided not to trust fedex with an expensive package, so i drove 5 hours to the nearest bestbuy that had the alienware m17 laptop i wanted in stock.
Nice to see something good come out of so much destruction.
Noooo he actually did the LTT Store water bottle move XDD I'm freakin dying here.
The two of you are legends to help someone in need. Thank you for helping restore faith in humanity <3.
Subbed to support quality tech videos my friend
When you said, a gamer lost his gaming pc and we cant have that. I felt that.
garbo reaction, lmao, said ty for the tshirt, but never said ty for the pc,
starting from 4:45 he looks like he really needs to pee, anyways great video!
That is the most reddit looking person I have ever seen 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Found you from this video, and the timing couldnt be better cause I started messing around with true nas for my own youtube channel and by god getting it set up was a pain, but your videos helped, so just wanted to say ta.
That's awesome to see someone who lost everything get a little something back.
he was tryna run control rtx 4k
linus: craft somputing lives just down the street from spencer it turns out me: *watches an entire drive on a highway to get to spencer*  dangit linus
That was too legit of a LTT store plug 😂😂 love it
Thanks to Linus and his crew, you have a new subscriber. As a casual gamer (with a R7 3700X and a 2060 Super in an Enthoo Pro "TG" case), I think that was an amazing thing to do.  I hope Spencer is doing well.
He is looking like what I expect from a reddit and discord user
Ive played a number of matches on a few diff games w Spence really great guy funny in the chats wish there was something I could do to through a hand in and help spence if there is and u see this I'm just down in Cali email me
Ok to be honest I wasn't going to subscribe to him. Then the last part showed me that he is a responsible dude in this crazy hard times we are going through. So ya you deserve a sub, keep up the good work 👍
Hey man. Big ups to you for making that drive for Spencer. I'm in Washington State myself (shout out to my PNW homies) and I have had the identical experience of my father-in-law asking me to deliver him something because I'm "just down the road" - to clarify, I live in the Greater Seattle Area, and he lives down in Chehalis! What I'm trying to say is, video views aside, it was super nice of you to make the trip for a fan who had fallen upon misfortune. You totally earned my sub today.
found your channel because of LTT I freaking love your content my guy
I live in Keizer Oregon I'm just next door to Salem
Was that a gtx 690 that I saw on that shelf
Am I the only one who feels like this dude is a little unappreciative in his reception? Like he just suffered a tragedy so maybe hes reeling but I would have been BAWLING. fuck I got real tears when linus put the burnt cooler mount in :o this was quite underwhelming. I should have just went on assuming this dude had a girly fit over it. I would have had a girly fit over the damn LTT bottle :P
But can it run Crysis?
Oh that's the monitor I have
I wanna say thank you to LTT  and Craft computing for doing this for a local gamer. I live around 15-20 minutes north of Spencer and being evacuated myself 3 times durning that week. I know this has affect many in my area. Again Thank you guys for all you do.
Spencer does look like the typical redditor
10/10 wholesome
He got punished for buying 20 series
wonder what his fps in tf2 is
Can it run doom tho ?
I never expected he was f a t
8:16 Do you think it will run TF2? This guy won my heart 💜 if he plays TF2 he totally deserved that PC
As a fellow gamer Spencer, keep your head up king.
Gotta love the home state rain
Great job guys, and you drove all that way, who wants to do that. It made his day. Best video ever.
i saw this already, but i caught it in the reruns on FB and had to see it again. i love feel good stories.
It was so bad here in Gresham, OR that I had to use my paint sprayer resperator as I was getting sick and I was in the house but our house smelled smokey like the fireplace dampers were closed when you light a fire and realize it and needed to open them. Only with the smoke being so bad outside we closed all our fireplace dampers and even then it made our whole family sick. :| I am trying to build a new computer myself and it is so hard finding the AMD Ryzen 5900X and 3080 FTW3 Ultra Gaming. :| I have pretty much everything else. >.<
Neckbeard - beard = this guy
Man, you can tell Steven is a gamer lol.
Eyyy fellow tf2 player
good for spencer....
this guy is probably a heavy main
3:47 laughs in EU
The nose had Sumthimg innit
TF2, what a god
What can I say, I found Linus' video first and had to watch this one - all you guys just made my day and more importantly I know you made Spencers day.  I love watching these kid of videos to remind me not everyone in the world is a total jerk, there sure are a lot of em.
Please tell me Spencer has youtube channel or what his new reddit user is im trying to reach out to him cause I wanna show my acknowledgement of his situation and try to be one his friends too, I'm Ricksanchezc131
Gets entire new PC built by most famous tech YouTuber: "k"  Gets a t-shirt: "OMG MAN THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M SO LUCKY"
The LTT store water bottle. Stylish.
I live in Indy. Smoke could be smelt from the fires in the morning if temp got below the dew point. Which is high in Indy.  Btw my brother lives in Hillsboro.  I visited him with my son during the summer, and it was really fun out there.  It seemed like there was always some public event going on during the evening.
Hey! I'm here from LTT's channel but I thought this was really cool.. I grew up and spent most my life in the Sublimity/Stayton area just 15 miles east of Salem. I live on the other side of the US now but seeing this really makes me miss the Oregon mentality. This is just awesome
chins up mate
Technically the computer is out of date but still good for year's to come.
All wearing masks outside. Fucking madness.
heartwarming.
It really touched my heart man Imagine how Spencer felt You and linus did a great thing 🤘🏻
great of ltt to do this but a 5 year subscription to the gym and healthfood would have been better on the long run i think
I have a whole new respect for Mr. Linus And Mr. Craft Computing. This was wonderful
My wife and I live in Grand Ronde--near Spirit Mountain Casino and we took a road trip through that area to see a friend after some quarantine time. The destruction was sobering--especially in Detroit, Oregon.
Wow, this made me feel so sad for him. Great job, Linus and Craft Computing. The PC looks great.
I live in Salem too, holy crap
He looks like generic redditor      Coming from a redditor
I also live in Oregon, I know exactly the impact of the wild fires here, one of them right next to where I live actually. I am very fortunate to have my area(s) around me still standing today. I can't imagine what everyone in Oregon's impact from the fires must have been.
he even looks like a reddit user lmao
One Oregonian to another, thank you.
Honestly just a great group of people. little stuff like this helps renew my faith in people
Subbed just for the proper Linus-brand Segue!
i tot he was thinner xD but my boy gone 4:3
Linus: "He lives just down the road from Spencer!" Reality: 6 hour round trip...
"The look on Spencer's face"... slightly marred by wearing a mask all over it. LOL!
Spencer is 185 mile away. We Germans call it a typical 90 minute drive.
you guys are awesome thanks for doing this
Jesus America....
Definitely a reddit user rip pc
How do people drive without music
Use bricks to build houses
That about look like your average redditor
I freaking love this kind of kindness in the world!
Wow, spencer is BIG boi
these videos give me hope that humanity is not always bad
What a lovely bloke
If i lose everything in a house fire I’ll make sure to hit up Linus (and the insurance company)
Look up transmission rate outside. Come on dude.
Jeff, You are an incredible person for doing this, as well as Linus and his team. I wish I found yours and LTT's video on this sooner. I live in Medford, so just a few minutes from Talent and it was a scary moment for everyone. But for you guys to reach out and help someone is amazing! Thank you Jeff and Linus for your very nice act of kindness and willing to help and support another fellow gamer. I tip my hat to you guys!
5:40 you can see balloons and flowers, it hurts my heart knowing how many people are suffering and were lost in the blaze. My heart goes out to everybody who's lost somebody or their homes in wildfires.
You just earned a subscriber. Cheers from Portland!
Oh my god. All houses gone. It look like had warfare
Евала пичове! (Great job, guys! (Linus too!)
exactly the definition of a pc gamers
On a different note, this really warmed my heart. After everything Spencer went through, it’s awesome to see some of the big names in the community reach out to help him. It really shows how the community of gamers cares for one another.  Also, his reaction really showed how much that gesture meant to him. Spencer has seemed to have a surprisingly upbeat outlook this whole ordeal. He literally posted a picture of his burnt rig and rather than sulking, he says “it was fun while it lasted!!”  I never would have thought to share, I would have been too busy burying the rig and crying about all the loss... I should learn from Chozo, a positive outlook on anything will always beat out negativity.  thanks to everyone involved for doing such a beautiful thing during this year of mass struggle.
Hate that I recognized the music from meet n’ f**k games 🤣
i tihnk his tredmaill might of also burn in the fire
7:35 Craft Computing be like "Wasasup can a loc come up in yo crib?"
Living in the first world 2020... This isn't virtuous, you're fulfilling what someone *wants* while many others are in *need.* He's going to die from cardiovascular disease before he's 40 without medication or medical intervention and you're contributing to that. Go ahead and tell me to eff off, you know I'm right.
Nobody: some random dudes pc burns down. Everyone else: OH MY GOD BUY HIM A NEW ONE! Wut
So can i ask why you didnt put any thermal paste?
Hes a nice guy
super wholesome <3 nothing like some Canadian love!
thank god he didn't pull a linus and drop the pc while taking it out of the box
302 people that have no love.
I peeped that Elecom HUGE. My man.
gotta get the 10  mins
I'd give two thumbs up but can't, so you'll just have to get one and a Subscribe.
Super cool.
You guys rock, seriously. ❤
this is great, i love seeing how kind people of the pc community are, literally brought a tear to my eye. As someone who has lost alot to natural disasters i can say that this would mean so so much even. You sir have earned yourself a lifetime subscriber and fan.
I have seen the destruction first hand. Its bad. And also super cool that you guys are helping people that got affected by the fires.
At least one bright light in the darkness left behind by the fire.
The view on 5:27 is utterly depressing, to say the least.
8:53 He said it! He said the thing! Freakin love it here!
i came here to like your video because its a great story but the LTT promo got a laugh and a subscribe too.
Heart warming. Nice to see stuff like this thanks LTT for introducing us to this channel!
I can tell where you are just from the freeway
It's way more touching when you see Spencer rock that gamer bod. 😀 That ain't no normie who's gonna play 2 games of Among Us a month.
plugging lttstore.comXD
He did say "thank you" right? ...i'm sure he did....did he?....hold on
Isn't Oregon one of the biggest hippie / hipster PC-correct states ever?
This face mask is way too small on Spencer
This right here is what restores faith in humanity and brings that bit of light back to a dark world. Well done mate and I found this via Linus’s channel so good on you mate and good on Linus I think the trade was well worth it.
definitely a good thing! bless you for doing this
That's just awesome. Very heart warming. I've got lots of family in socal, so I know all about the damn fires.
bro didn't linus said down the road?
I enjoyed your rainX on the drive
I cried seeing all those homes burned. I live in Oregon so that really hurt to watch. But seeing you guys do this made it tears of happiness
Doing the lords work
It was the Lttstore.coo for me
This was amazing!
aw and hes a metroid fan, even better <3
what a heartwarming story for 2020
Awesome to both teams. Thanks for the joy.
That fire should of burnt a few calories off of spencer
way to less thermal paste. it will burn again :(
Wholesome build
This is heartwearming! But that mask looks so tiny. 😂
I’m glad Spencer is happy :)
9:23 Anyone else got a lil'bit scared because of the blue truck?
Yes man that is a very good thing that you and linus have done.
5:26 is a sobering moment
Really cool of you and Linus to collaborate instead of compete for the viral video opportunity. Shows how genuine your caring natures truly are! Big props. 🔥
his just up the road is half of england
Awesome stuff ....... IDK what ISP is over there but did he even have internet yet to download any games?
Bet that the money that he spends in food he could aford a new rig no problem
So a standard surgical blue mask (what i see most people wear) Are made for use in a sterile environment. In that environment its good for up to 2 hours depending on use,  before it becomes "dirty" enough that mask becomes ineffective. And will need to be changed. Do you know how long one of those masks is good for in a NON sterile environment? 15 minutes or less before mask gets to the point of being ineffective.  Do you know how many people i see wear a mask alone in their car? TONS! I laugh every time. A standard face mask (non respirator) will only prevent you from transmitting covid. They do NOTHING to keep you from contracting covid. So why wear one alone in your car? Are they trying to stop themselves from getting their own covid? LoL, its all so silly.  If you have covid, by all means WEAR A MASK. But if you don't have it, what's the point? THE MASK IS USELESS.  And nobody ever mentions facial hair. If you have a thick beard (ME) then putting on a dinky surgical mask does JACK SQUAT!  And to cap it off i see MANY people wear their mask below their nose. Pointless! just take it off at that point the mask is doing NOTHING! I even saw one woman in a grocery store a couple days ago actually take off her mask to sneeze. Then she put the mask back on. SIMPLY AMAGZING!
Man if i knew you tubers would jump to build me a new one. I would have set my computer on fire years ago.
😂 Linus said you lived down the road 😂 u said 3 hour drive
Spencer even looks like a Redditor, no offense
amazing!
"playing video games makes you violent" ahh yeah sure media...
Wait. American navigation systems measure "distance" in TIME and NOT in ACTUAL DISTANCE?
woah this Linus guy makes good PC's wonder when he will be famous
Aww that’s cool. Even had the water bottle plug! ;)
The sight of the burnt down houses was just depressing.
I grew up in Medford! Really cool to see you guys helping people from my hometown out :)
I have a feeling at some point in the future these water bottles will be known as "waterbottleellteeteestoredotcoms".
Awesome! I'm here from LTT, loving this! (Good grief the destruction!)
I had respect then you had to go and promote a C.h.inese run propaganda site.   These fires were caused not by the environment but by arsonists who reddit openly supports and provides information for.  Don't be part of the problem, be part of the solution and break with the propaganda driven sites.    You reap what ya sow, and for that you have lost a viewer.
Dude, Salem center is the best mall I’ve ever been to, this includes MOA which is in my state!
Is this a Star Wars Kid ?
Trim your nose hair
This is super cool!
"Will it run TF2?" my man ! 🤜🤛
Congrats on such a touching move
He plays TF2 what a legend
America is like that. Most states at least vertically have a 4-5 hour drive top to bottom. My buddy lives in Colorado and I as well. However 3 hr drive inbetween means we are lucky to meet up once every couple years. Just facts.
That damage hit me right in the feels. Reminded me of Joplin, Missouri after the tornado. May the deity of your choice watch over you guys
Would love to see some kind of program/series come out of this, looking for computer tragedies and solving them. This was great!
Knowing that they did this warms my heart, when this whole fire thing was going on I was up in warm springs OR fighting that fire and going home down in the next town over seeing what happened really tugs at the heart
Linus: "He lives really close to someone we know"   *3 hour drive*
thought Linus said u lived up the road from him, 3 hours drive? jeez
This is so heart warming because I can’t imagine how bad it would feel to get your house burned down man but this was great I bet it brought Spencer some joy in this horrible situation
Haven't been able to keep up with LTT much this year, but I came across the build video just a few minutes ago. Subscribing due to the sheer good guy-ness going on here.
This rocks
Amazing work guys. Spencer sorry for the loss of your home. Glad you're safe.
Mannnnn that place looks depressing Hope everyone recovers from that
I’m from OR too (pdx) and seeing the devastation in Spencer’s area os very heartbreaking. I’m sure this made his current predicament feel less sad. Kudos to LTT and Craft Computing for this amazing gesture! There is really good in the world <3
He deserves it!!!
As someone who lost a lot of things in a storage that is in Oregon, It's nice to see people being helped out.
Spencer looks as such a nyce guy! I'm glad he got his rig back!
The guy passing by at 4:57 has me rolling 😭😂😂
5:29 got daum...😲🥺😳
I want to support Spencer's content! Does he have any twitch channel? :)
Humanity Restored.
This honestly brought a tear to my eye 😃
Love to see wholesome videos like this. Thank you
wholesome af
my dude spencer picked the good ending
Thank god I see no hate comments
As a man with beard I'd love the face mask he's wearing from 6:28, anyone has an id?
It's so funny how people in the US think it's so important to wear those masks, but none of you wear the right kind, or the right way...
Incredible. Thank you, from all of your viewers <3
that pc is more expensive than all of my things together
I didn't think it would, but this video made me tear up quite a bit. I live in Oregon as well, and while my family was safe, not all of my friends could say the same. It's a little painful seeing the devastation, but this is overall a decently happy story. Thank you
You guys should have gotten bullet barry involved as well. He lives in medford last time I heard. Would've been a sick trio collab!
every new computer I make as my old motherboard screws, I have like 20 year screws in my computer form like 7 generations or rebuilds
Good Stuff
Oh I love the ltt store pitch lol awsome
I'm so happy to see that i got into such an amazing community this past year when i built my very first pc, and i'm very happy to see that neverluckychozo(not sure how he has it spelled) got so much help from this community and got a new pc..the pc community is such so amazing and i love you guys(yes including craftcomputing and LTT, jayztwocents,bitwit and the others..all hail the pc master race
Real heroes man, i love you guys
Cam I have a Pc coz atm i have a laptop that can only run among us
He even looks like a reddit user. Story checks 100%
why do i think of gaben when i see this dude
Awesome
spencer enjoy you new pc! :)
He looks like your average redditor
tbh tf2 is so unoptimzied that there is a chance it won't run source: I have over a thousand hours on tf2 and have never seen it run well
Americans caring for and helping each other.  That is what makes this country great.  GO VOTE!
Subscribed, turned on the bell. Gotta say it love the intro, but spicing it up a bit w music would be dope.
What if... One day.. He won't be Jeff?
I had a PC die in a apartment fire once along time ago so its really cool to see you guys do something like this for someone cause i know the pain of losing your gaming PC soon after building it, all of you are amazing
In Germany, we call something up the road when its <= 1km or < 1 mile away. Its crazy that you drove so far for this.
"up the road" linus said. it's an easy drive he said. classic clickbait Linus. Thanks alot
Jesus, pulling into that neighborhood was an absolutely sobering moment while watching this.  Nice to see the conclusion of a great story
267 salty bois that have never heard of being human.
I heard continue for 3 hrs and 20 mins and I knew that this was definitely oregon
You're a G. The fires were a nightmare. Shout out from your followers up in Portland.
Everyone liked that
very sweet, interesting way to wear a mask doe :P
I’m still using a gtx 660
I... don't know about that bracket. I at least hope he sanded it and made sure it wasn't the least brittle. Corroded metal also is a dirt magnet. Nice sentimental touch, I hope it lasts.
Don't be shocked about mask aha in Australia I have failed to see one person wearing a mask and I travel to the city 5 days a week for work.. but great content!!
Man, I live in Canada and had a forest fire destroy some forest RIGHT beside my home and it was scary having to evacuate but man, I couldn't imagine these state wide fires...
That was very nice of this community to do, respect.
Ля, красавчик)
Big chungus reddit moment
You live IN SALEM TO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Redditor
congrats spencer you deserved it buddy i cant believe the damage it did truly sorry bro
Dam boi he THICC
Nice job to both channels! 👍🏻👍🏻
oh no its a redditor
I’ve had a computer for 8 years and it still runs but it lags
almazing but who does he remind me of nostalgia critic
This was pretty damn great, kudos to good people.
This is one of the most wholesome bits of content I've seen in a while. You guys are amazing for doing this for him!
WoW 👏 love the PC community
I live in Salem Oregon lol.
When you drove through the town it looks like Chernobyl
Awesome job guys.. it's great.
The green text was legit
made me smile :)
Well congratulations to the boy! 👍    But he better play 2 hours a day and do sports 4 hours a day...really...boy...do sport!
Spencer better change his reddit username after this  Edit: ohhh...i paused way too early nvm lmao
respectably he looks like Lord Gabe. Nice
love you guys keep up with the good work
This bottle on the background is a Hidrohoney Yggdrassil from Brazil?
im happy for him.....i have a hard time too living whitout a Pc nowdays .
Fantastic, good people still exist and it gives Spencer a little bit of normalcy back to his life. Great job guys
Super nice move of both of you. Hope all those people who lose their homes are ok and can recover from it too.
Hey look rain... :)
this is a great story honestly
Still hate the fact that twomad got a better pc than this guy
I went with you. 😎
I love the collaboration that you guys did to help this guy out.  Thank you so much for helping him! :D
Now who's gonna help me replace my broken pc from 2005 😭😭😭😭😭😭
And remember when they said gaming was anti-social.  Great story.
I live not to far from where those fires were in Oregon. My Air quality rating peaked at 460ish which is 160 above hazardous. Luckily we didn’t have to evacuate, but we were on standby. I joke with my dad that if we had to evacuate, that I’d grab a backpack full of clothes, my phone/wallet/other essentials, and my $4000 custom PC that I built last Christmas. Luckily it never came to that, but it’s crazy to see the reality of what could have been my home had the fires continued.
i shouldve expected him to look like that
wholesome
You guys and Linus really helped make this guy's day, this is just amazing to see!
so cool of both you and LTT. good to see
i dont wanna be mean but he looks like what id imagine the stereotypical reddit gamer would look like
Great thing you guys did here. Just one question. How did some houses survive that? It looks like a scene from fallout. Good luck to all affected.
Is that andy milanokis under that mask?
Hey Jeff, you now there are windshield wipers right? ;D
wholesome
Aww, you guys are amazing.
I like how in the US, living "basically up the road from him" means being a 3h drive away. That's like crossing a very small european country haha
people like you did life much nicer. Thank you all. Hello from Ukraine.
Just goes to show that the PC enthusiast community takes care of each other!
Nice LtT store plug.
LOL even here I find a LTT store plug.
You and LMG get major props for this. Great thing you all did!!!
And if you have some time between gaming.....please do some gym.
You have a new sub from Canada :)
dat LTT store dot com! haha
You know you've made it when your merch store spot is such a meme on its own that everyone else plugs it too
One cannot simply escape the lttstore
I just burnt my house. Now what?
No shit. I live in Salem too. Good on you man!
You might have wanted to try using RNNoise to remove the wind noise.
Here because of LTT, subd for the content.
And thus the "Slightly Lucky_Chozo" was born
Just some dust in my eye...
Who just came from linus's video
2 words... Fucking Awesome!
As someone who lives in North Portland I can confirm this state is deceptively big.
Can't escape the lttstore promos... even on channels that don't belong to linus!
So glad to see Andy Milanokis happy for once.
its so wholesome
2080 don’t complain about that I’m working with a regular ol nvidia gtx 1050 with a ryzen 5 lol I’m too broke for a better pc but it works ima continue playing on it for a good while
Ah the Oregon weather, rain and not rain.
Should've also given this kid a larger mask..   Awesome video!
180 miles is a cross-country trip in Denmark.
TF2, the real legend :)
I am happy that his PC was replaced. You both did a great thing. Love to see it.
i like your mask. where can i find one of these?
More proof that while YouTube chases profits, the YouTubers are building a Global Community.
MY NAME JEFF
* be reddit guy * House burns down RIP PC :( Linus builds new PC   Spencer living in a box with his new RGB PC: *"Please don't tell anyone how I live"*
Amazing. I wish spencer the best of luck with his new PC, and hopefully he has a place of his own again soon!
"just down the road" ....I've driven to other states in less time.  Pretty sure I can drive through Ohio in that time
Talent.... there were a LOT of Talented people who lost homes in Talent, and Phoenix.  The author/artist of The Sword Interval, Ben Fleuter.  The painter for every airbrushed Falcon Northwest system, Jeremiah Thiring.  The best combo bike shop and pub in 200 miles, Flywheel Bicycles.  That was a scary night for the whole Rogue Valley.
4:40 Sheesh.. i had to google it, and it seems from my current position, i cant travel 185 miles in ANY direction, without leaving my country.
TF2 = Titanfall 2
man when he turned onto the road and the music stopped...
Says only 130,000 people  Me: lives in a town with 2,500
i love oregon so much! its just the best place to live during 2020!
I live in salem as well, one of my friends that lived in malala got his house burned down. These fires are stupid.
6:56 .. he  tore the bag...HE TORE THE FUCKING BAG!!!
Fan loses gaming rig, Two of the heavyweights in the techtube world partner up to hook him up. This is exactly the sort of thing that makes these youtubers great. They will step up to help out their fans. From using their resources to build a great rig (LTT crew) to making sure it makes the journey safely (Craft). This is awesome to see!
It's a nice gesture and all but seems kinda inconsequential compared to everything else that was lost. I hope contributions will be made to the effort to rebuild/clean up, as well, not just an ultimately pointless (in the bigger scheme of things) gaming PC.
Always great to see people helping each other out, good job!
who down votes this? honestly? Awesome work guys!
Wow. Anybody else's stomach drop seeing the remains of those houses? I've seen a lot of post-fire houses, but never to the point of such decimation... I hope everyone in that community can get back on there feet, and if you know of a trustworthy method of donation for families in need, drop a link.
Wholesome
bro Spencer defines the term "redditor"
"think it'll run TF2" lol got his priorities straight
LTT's sponsor spots have leaked their way into this channel somehow!
bouta burn my pc
Loved the plug at 5:10 for LTT Store!  Got a good laugh out of that one.
Love this! It made my day!
Happy days in a pretty harsh time. Thank you for bringing some positive vibes!
Jeff: Yeah, he leaves just up the road from me. Just 185 miles  up the road 😂😂😂  I thought it was on the same street or something lol  Great stuff from you and Linus 🤙🤙
Well now whenever bullies say that he is fat he can just retort that he have a gaming PC built by the one and only Linus Sebastian. Oh and a 2080 super
Just lovely - Big Hearts from Germany - well done!
🙂🙂🙂
Yo this reddittor lives in my neighboring city
LOL.  I loved that LTT Store plug.
The LTT store bit had me actually laughing out loud
Subbed awesome collaboration
I'm glad that hes happy with it. Poor guy
Humans helping Human. Just like what society should be.
Hang in there, Spencer, and I am sure that this experience will make you stronger, and you will get some benefits out of it in the future.
Nice work guys ! Thanks for a very positive video :)
I used to live in Talent. Weird to think it's basically not there anymore.
Well done.
5:13 lol proud
A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood
looked at it for like 5 seconds and knew he mounted the old brackets? i smell bullshit
Er.. you say the audio is better with the other setup?
Wholesome AF! Great Job guys :D
Wholesome
5:25 Fuckin' chills dude.  Leveled worse than the tornado hit neighborhood I visited.
I love the plugs for LTT that was amazing. Sorry to everyone affected by this awful tragedy though...
It was obviously not his own house since he was only caring for the PC inside of it, but still I very deeply respect the LTT team and you for reaching out and helping someone that got struck by fate.  Having that said, How the heck is this even physically possible?! 6:05
That was super nice From Linus and you dude. I jumped over to your channel fo this so I could finish up.  I wonder if this is a tax write off?
Spencer is really vibin that PCMR Gaben energy...  but seriously shoutout to you guys for doing this, amazing gesture in the face of a terrible situation
I hope someone send me a pc too. I'm only using my brother's old sony vaio laptop and i think it will die of old age anytime
Awesome colab! Subscribed!
subbed from linus channel, and loved the coop and compassion. Also, hillarious to put in the ltt store bits... hehe... :D
Thank you
L T T S T O R E D O T C O M
9:24 thought he was going to die from the truck
Wholesome and pure moments!
This, I declare unto you all, that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. He who was from the very beginning is the light of the world. In him was life and that life was the light of men that lighteth every man that cometh into the world. That life was manifest in the flesh and men beheld the Word of Life.   I know you profess to live, yet ye are dead. I know you trust in your hearts but the heart is deceitful above all things and is desperately wicked. If ye have not obeyed the gospel of Jesus Christ and you profess to see, how will I convince you that you are blind? I cannot convince you of the truth unless you are willing to step out in faith and receive the truth. Thus saith the Lord God of heaven, The Lord Jesus will return in flaming fire to take vengeance on all they that know not God and obey not the gospel of Jesus Christ. Jesus is the light of the world, and the light we have are the words he and his holy apostles spoke by the Holy Ghost and the doctrine they taught. And they taught men everywhere to REPENT and be BAPTIZED in the name of JESUS CHRIST for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.   Many of you have not obeyed the gospel and many of you will refuse to come to the true light and you will hold on to that false light, wresting the scripture to accommodate your doctrine unto your own destruction. For the true sheep of Jesus Christ who hear his voice, come and receive the grace of God and come off of that broad path that leadeth to destruction that the mainstream is on. The mainstream are the ones who say unto the seers “See not” and say to the prophets “Prophesy not unto us right things, prophecy smooth things.” The mainstream turn their ears from the truth and are turned unto fables. But the called, the chosen and the faithful will endure forever in the everlasting kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ.  The arm of the Lord is extended to you this day friends and neighbors. The question is, Unto whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?
Its a very nice thing both you and Linus have done for this unfortunate gentleman. You have just helped to restore my faith in humanity, Thank you very much , to both Yourself and Linus.
i didnt see the post, link please?
Hugo 1 mile? is Biffa playing with the traffic in Oregon?
I am a 40 year old man crying over this act of goodwill and generosity. GG. <3
Errrr.... No beer this time ?
In my My area wow cool thing you did!
아름답고 새로운 보금자리가 마련되기를 바래요.
Always amazing to see that there are still good people in the world!  I'm surprised there weren't tears.  Awesome job guys!
My heart sank when I saw the burnt down houses... Happy for this guy 👍
Awesome to see ltt doing something nice for the community and supporting a smaller YouTuber
I like em big . I like em chunky.
I live over in McMinnville, nobody except someone from Oregon is going to know where the hell that is.
its alot to ask for but could you guys drop a sub im trying to grow my channel 😁
Smoke was so bad every here in oregon. If the winds didnt change when they did we would have lost the valley as well. My friends in molalla and estacada  got super lucky. Thankfully the blue river fire didnt get into Thurston/Springfield so those people had a place to go and a veneta fire was contained in time so eugene was safe. But i ran a gaming rig with fx4200 and gtx 650 till i got a 64 error 3 months ago. Miss gaming on a pc..
Offtopic: where can I get that facemask? it's so cool!
That's awesome
5:30 - jaw drops
It was great for you and Linus to do this for someone. I lived in OR from 94-97 and yes in Portland, Aloha, Beaverton area. To see that destruction of a wildfire, and still hopeing others are ok. Items can be replaced, but your life cannot.
As a fellow Oregonian who lost a piece of family history in Detroit Oregon, I understand and respect your move to help this man out. Still gives me the chills when I think about the EAS going off on my phone over and over and over and over....
Much love from Clarkston WA.
So glad this wasn't a poor excuse for a scam!  Great job LTT and Craft Computing!!!!
Lucky guy awesome
Come on, dude!   Why make a comment about that rest stop like that?  Is was a great video until then. Some people just don't like wearing the muppet masks and I can't blame them.
Very nice thing you did here. I appreciate good people and good karma like this in the world. ❤️
As a former Oregonian, I certainly miss that view driving down I-5 into Grants Pass. 5:20
Good job on this video. Glad you were being safe too. I live in that part of Oregon and it was so devastating!
Subbing because of this. 👍
noone is safe from LTT merch XD
The winner is so cute!
I feel sorry about his home being lost 😢  but this was awesome of both you and ltt  to do this he was so happy  🙏🏼
I think what you did makes the world a better place, whe we stand one for each other and everybody lends a hand to other people, is when you see the good on this world, May God gives you mucho more so you can keep helping other people.
Not gonna lie, I cried.
LOL, the LTT store plug. That was perfect!
5:26 , that's a very humbling and somber moment for everyone. Say what you want about Portland, nobody out here deserved to have their homes, their lives, their memories, or their PC's taken like this. It's like Fallout/Silent Hill.
5:12 Linus gets his plug.
What a great deed and heart warming action!! The burnt park is... really sad and shocking to see. Stay safe everyone
I guess anything truly is possible... actually appreciated the LTT product placement
the shameless LTT plug. love it
nice   car ride  even got a  LTT@ water bottle....com   LOL   good  stufff
You seem like a really decent fella, great work. Earned my sub :-)
big respect for everyone involved ! you guys are awesome, hope everyone recovers after those fires !
the images of those houses burned to the ground are very hard to watch, but what you and Linus did is truly wonderful. a little yet significant thing that can help him go through the trouble and fear he's lived. PCMR fellows should always be like this!
This is so awesome. Nice to see a little bit of good news, and very nice to see some rain up there. I used to live 15-20 minutes away from Paradise. Fires have been brutal last couple years. Stay safe everyone.
I grew up in Ashland, just south of Talent.  The fires have been incredibly devastating to so many of the people I grew up with.  Thank you for bringing a bit of a joy back to the Rogue Valley.
Salvation is found in no one else, no other name under heaven given among men where by we must be saved. Saved from the punishment of sin. I’m trying to offer people hope in absolute perfection !!! No more dying, lies, decay, depression, anxiety, crying, sickness, rotten food, broken things , etc... offering the hope of Eternity in heaven with Jesus Christ. We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness. And to know and live out his teachings. Visual Bible movies on YouTube ❤️👑✝️📖🙏⛑🔥
I'm so happy we can do this for eachother in the pc community Good luck gaming Spencer!
Faith in humanity has been restored. PCMR has prevailed, once again.
Wow just watched Linus video I was like wait what he made a pc for guy called Spenser but then he told that he has a youtube channel I was like wait what....How he edit his video without his pc just wanna ask you how you edit your old videos Without your pc and it 4K video wait what
Gamer nation.. unite
Good lord I can't escape the  *LTT STORE BOTTLE* can I?
This is great for everyone in 2020. But my favorite part of this video had to be the LTTstore water bottle part
Even in an up-and-coming tech YouTube channel, we are never safe from lttstore.com
I actually choked up watching this. Kudos to both CC and LTT for doing this, you are awesome humans.
No Hug. i though he was going to, when he opened the box. Well he likes it that reaction is more than enough great work linus Tech tips & craft computing.
Can't help but notice,  That was a very bro move of you and LTT.  you did good.
Lttstore.com got me
Feels Good! 2020 Has been a fucked year but this was very heartwarming <3
I'm glad to see he got this, nice wholesome video. Stuff like this makes me love online even more, such wholesome stuff
The reused burnt mounting bracket is a concern. It might snap off soon as it corrodes even more. But other than that lovely build
Great man really made my day seeing a happy face.
Great work done
this is wholesome
Happiness restored! But where did you get that face mask though?
"Neighbours"  continue straight for 3 hours.
Seems like a such a cool guy. Glad to see you guys got him back and running.
Waiting for mr beast to give that guy a house
Really happy for the guy, as an Aussie I've seen the devastation bushfires can bring in their wake, Great to see you guys get together and help this guy out after this tragedy, and especially with all the other stuff the world is facing. I also love the touch with the mounts, I don't think it would have been the same without it in there.
Linus sent me. Like for you.
incredulous look of realization as to how long the drive is going to be starting at 4:33
Thanks for helping Spencer
I feel for this gamer, I though it was bad that my core duo PC died; at least I still have my data. I used to work at Best But, and would recommend not only people have a back up drive to copy data too every day, but to hide one somewhere in their home in case someone breaks in at steals the PC and external drives. I also recommend folks put a drive in a safety deposit box or PO box. Another option is giving this drive to a family member who is not in your area. This can help in case of fire, earthquake, etc. You can back up online, but it can get expensive; and downloading Terabytes of data can take longer than restoring a drive locally.   I feel for folks who loose PC's like this, and due to having an aunt who lost everything in 2015 due to the fires in Northern California, thankfully, she has survived the fires since then, but like Oregon, this is becoming the new norm, so it's always in the back of my mind. Her experience is why I suggest people digitize and back up, hard copy photos, slides, old video taped, and even records, CD, and Audio Tape, collections.   Thankfully, I have a core due iMac, and a Chromebook for going online. At some point I will buy a gaming PC, when money permits. Folks like you and Linus are great for donating computers to folks like this guy.   Did you say 3 hours to drive 180 miles, that's insane. Takes about 2.5 to 3 hours to visit my aunt, but she lives in the mountains.  Keep up.the great work, glad I found your channel.
Mind if I subscribe
This is the best thing i have seen ltt do. Should have got him vr to go with it so he can get moving around. Poor dude is gonna have a heart attack before 35
*Trying to hold back tears as he sets up his new gaming rig* *Sees him open the LTT water bottle* "LTTstore.com" *Uncontrollable laughter*
i cant even open my window without getting a headache
Just terrific to see some good things happening!!
Technical, way over my head.  At Amazon*^🎄🎄.. please stay safe @t
Oh bleep. Oregon wildfires. Of course that's what it was. Good vibes to you and LTT, Jeff! [edit:] Wait, oh god, you live in Salem too? Flipping awesome!  However, oh gods how sobering a view of that town is. That's not far from the view over to the east, and it still haunts me.
the place reminds me of sanctuary from fallout 4
<3
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Good hearted people still exits, wholesome video ❤️
Love the LTT store shout out! Really made me laugh
Very cool!
lttstore.com haha. congrats on the new pc Spencer. All the best from Sydney, Australia
So you're telling me all I gotta do is burn down my house and Linus will build me a PC?!
You guys are fucking Legends in a year deprived of legends
That area of razed homes... I wish it wasn't a scene so commonplace now. I'm glad Spencer got a rig to replace the one lost.
That was a superb act of kindness from Linus Sebastian (and his Linus Media Group team) and Jeff from Craft Computing!  Enjoy, Spencer!
*I'm here for the mask 😂*
U guys are awesome im not a softy but damn yall killed it made his day....awesome things u guys did just subscribed rn an gon keep watching new vids...coolest thing ive seen lately so dope!!!
Wow 😮 never seen this disaster 😕 You guys did a great job!
I live in Oregon.  Each summer for nearly the last decade has increasingly bad wildfires that bring smoke into the valley.  I had taken to buying medical masks to get by each time.  This was on an entirely different scale.  My *entire county* (about 2000 square miles or 5200 square kilometers) was under some level of evacuation warning.  It was frightening for me in particular to need to be ready to evacuate at a moment's notice.  I have certain medical needs that make traveling anywhere outside of my hometown a big inconvenience.  For perspective on how fast the wind was moving the wildfire smoke: https://photos.app.goo.gl/YYgsYVig6urgEF3m9.  These two photos from Sep 8 are only 14 minutes apart. :|  We spent the next few weeks choking on yellow air, a smog that you could not escape from even indoors.  The sun was just a red pinprick.  Also, those photos that went around social media showing _everything_ red?  Very, very real; a co-worker showed me a photo of the sky around their home further south.  My heart goes out to everyone who has lost family and property.  I cannot even imagine being someone whose whole town was burned away.  Thank you to CC and LTT for helping Spencer.
I'm not crying your crying
Wait.. you can remove LA from existence?   Good News Everyone!
im glad a fellow Oregonian did something good.
Thanks I'm also a local not really but im staying...(not from cali thou) enjoyed this video allot and made me feel like good people aren't rare. *Ben
tnq jeff you unboxed my dream 🖤
I live Just a little ways north of Talent in Medford. It and Phoenix were utterly devastated by the fire and I have many friends who lost everything. This is a wonderful Thing you guys did and I want to thank you so much for doing this. I drive all over for my job, and Breathtaking is a good way of describing the emotion driving the areas that were hit gives. Thank you again for this amazing gesture!
lttstore.com  @ 5:10
This is the kind of video that resorts my faith in people.  Great gesture to help someone in need.  Thank you.
Reddit moment
208 people are just sour grapes.
Nice product placement I do love ltt water bottles there the best
is your truck manual
Excellent job fellas ♥️♥️
Well done.
Great !!!
You have a Pro-4X? Nice. Great truck
So much love <3
Shout out to you man, the fires were horrible,the smoke killed so much. But it didn't kill our Oregonian love. We will recover. We will be green again.
That cheeky LTT store dot com had me rolling.  Really cool collaboration from influencers of the industry to take care of the community :)
This video was sponsored by LTTstore.com water bottles.
Try not to laugh your nuts off from my recent video
The end is no longer near; the end is now HERE!  Tomorrow may be too late for you; no one is guaranteed tomorrow. We are all sinners and the wages of sin is eternal death in hell! REPENT and ACCEPT JESUS CHRIST as your saviour today in 3 simple steps.  A - Accept that you are a sinner in need of a saviour B - Believe in your heart that Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, died and shed his blood for our sins, buried, resurrected on the third day, ascended to heaven and is seated at the right hand of God C - Confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is lord of your life.
Nice collab !!!
Where in oregon were you born? I was born in oregon city and live in Klamath falls area now. It's cool to see an oregonian youtuber, as from what I've seen they are pretty rare.
Hats off to all involved :)
Didnt realize you were from the PNW. The fires here in WA were bad but you guys got hit way too hard. Prays
very satisfying video
Im in grants pass fairly close to the fire
"Up the road" yeah right. You can cross my entire country (Belgium) in less time than that.
Just when I was thinking I'm subscribed to way too many channels. A subscription well deserved this time. Wish I could do more to reward your kindness. Thank you!
I live in Portland now, grew up in Blue River. Still breaks my heart to see my childhood home completely gone. That's really awesome of you guys to help a fellow PC gamer out. OR represent.
I really love that lttstore.com plug
18 So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. 19 But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge. 20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.” ACTS 4 GOD LOVES US ALL EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT DIDNT BELIEVE AND THIER CHILDREN BECAUSE HE KNEW THEY DIDNT KNOW BETTER THATS WHY HE SAID: “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under  wings, but you were not willing!
Holy moly this made it onto trending
Literally to the 1% who’s reading this,God bless you, stay safe and have a wonderful day💗(my dream is to become a famous YouTuber) thanks .
I have the same water bottle i love it
good on ya bud
Haha, nice touch of mentioning LTT store in a Linus's style!
Where did you get that amazing mask? I've tried googling such things and I'm coming up short. I really want one!
Nice little 20k sub bump from this awesome!
I feel like i was just shipped from another video just to see what happened next... .:,D
HAD to comment on masks. LOLE
Great job, way to help take care of a fellow human.  :)  Loved the LTT store plug as well.
This was great! Sending all of you guys love from California, I know those wildfires are no joke...
8:53 nice shout at
Awesome you guys were able to pull this off. As a fellow PC enthusiast, I can appreciate how expensive that equipment is. It's no replacement for a house, but it's probably all the morale booster he needs to get his house rebuilt. Good job providing a ray of sunshine through the train wreck of wild fires! 👍
Up the road, which the road is just merely 3 and a half hours of "driving straight".  Nonetheless, the PC looks really great, and I wish I am that lucky.  Also, the scene where the fire engulfed the houses are really shocking. Nothing reassemble a house to me.
Coom, consume. Coom, consume. Coom, consume. Coom, consume. Coom, consume. Coom, consume. Wear a face diaper.
very nice move guys...
The LTT store . com stuff made me laugh so hard
Look at the right side at 5:40 I thought it's octane's jump pad
Wow, I mean...this is obviously not enough to offset the pain of losing a home. Your drive through the housing part was heartwrenching.   But, what a great thing y'all did. Instant sub, thank you for making the community proud.
This was amazing!! We need more good stuff like this!!
you got my sub just for the slick LTT style merch segway.
omg this video made me cry u guys did such a beautiful thing
Thanks you so much.
One doesn't own emotion, and when one is owned by emotion, it's a reflection of one's belief that one owns them✌️Non-Duality
So nice.   Used to live in Oregon.   Heartbreaking to see the damage,  heart lifting to see the support.
undutiful yucking
OMG! That was amazing! My eyes got wet here for a moment, so nice of you guys!
Love the ltt water bottle plug
Just your average reddit user and tf2 player I see.
Why does he look like Cody's Lab?
So how much did Linus pay you for 05:11 ?
textbook grade redditor
I just subscribed. 1: Because you did what you could to help another person who has clearly had a horrible year and 2: Because of your shoutout to Lttstore.com!  I intend to go check out your other videos and I look forward to your future videos as well!
Came over from LTT! Much love man you and LTT are awesome! That is amazing!
Those boogers...
Fantastic. Subscribed.
Where did you get that black mask at 6:50?
LOL...nice plug for LTT Store....I'm sure Linus loved it too!
Happy ending! :D
Kurzes Statement von mir ist online schaut rein gönnt Abo Danke Family
I think I live probably around 15 miles from this kid, thats so weird.
Wouldn’t want to live anywhere else. Great humans here in Oregon
Anyone else looking for a comment from Spencer
Nice ------ awesome
Who else just came here from the LTT video
We all appreciate what you did!
Glad you're back up and running! Thanks for helping this guy :)
You all did something amazing and reminded me of why I keep following y'all. Stay safe, and stay healthy, and congrats on the new pc!
WONKY CABLES! Build ruined.
im glad to see spencer happy
lmao i have an amd radeon r9 200 series and you think you have a need for an upgrade
I wonder, if those building were made of brick, and steel, wil they be sooo much damaged, or will more of them survive..
You get a sub for just being amazing people (person?).  Thank you for bringing some light to a terrible situation.
Great set of videos by LTT and by CC. Well played all of you. 3.5 hours drive would put me in either Scotland or London.. hahahaha! Most of the UK Covered...
This is awesome. Great work
i dont mean to be rude but you can tell he uses reddit
Just seeing the video, I have subscribed.
#11 trending in the uk!
would recommend a low cut on audio in your car video bits. isolate 100hz upwards removing the frequencies below 100hz. Was doing my head in
Great vid. And you getting a sub for the flawless shameless plug for the LTT store.
I hope no more people have to go through what this people went. Here in Greece we had a same situation and things went very bad for lots and lots of families and frineds. It's very warming to see that actually someone like LLT and Craft Computing help a guy by give him back something he lost and was put in all in good faith....!  Job well done for both parties(LLT and Craft Computing)..... YOU ARE THE BEST AND REAL MVP!!!
I'm from oregon to had to evacuate for 10 days
This is one of the most wholesome things I've seen in a while good for you and Linus <3
Is it crazy that I built a mini pc because I live in wildfire country in the San Diego Ca area?
I really did not expect that LTTstore.com plug LOL
ol boy in the charger at 5min in was jammin
Him: it's just up the road Me: I could literally acros my country from north-west to south-east in the same amount of time
Good vibes
slow claps absolutely
Amazing work Jeff!
That drive through the town is the stuff of nightmares. What a bright spot in that landscape. Great job to all involved.
Time to burn my pc.
#1, as of this view (286,880) who are the 172 schlubs who disliked this video! #2 LTTstore.com. Great job supporting the PCMR guys. Two thumbs WAYYY up!
Mad props to you guys for this, seeing a whole town in fucking ashes is heartbreaking. Good on you to help out.
PLOT TWIST: Spencers old computer got overheated running TF2 and started the fire.

That LTT store.com plug was amazing
both you and linus did a great thing for someone and also restored faith in humanity for a lot of people watching.
You are such an awesome dude. Much love from Europe and i'm definitely going to subsribe to your channel. Great thanks for being such an awesome guy!
Oh man 🥴
Amazing Gesture. You have my subsribe for this. Amazing
Very cool. Great job and the Tech community can be a great place sometimes.
you are awesome!!! well done! :)
Aight. Time to burn my entire neighborhood.   Oh no wait, all houses here are made of concrete.
You guys did a really good thing.
Plot twist: giving new pc to a discord moderator
HUGE Thank you to you, Jeff! Much love from the LTT team. -CW
Good work. Things like this makes the world a little  bit better.
you should see the Australian wild fires
There's nothing left there oh my god... horrible... you did great with LTT for that ! Good jobs boyz
As Palpatine once said in a Video "The Great Eror has been corrected"
Well done everyone involved in this. Nice one
LttStore.com

Lets go man
This was a really pleasant start to my day, great videos from you and linus <3 Sub well deserved
this is so kind of you to perform such a touching actions
Seing that completely burnt place was... something. That, in the midst of America? I swear, this was shocking - and it was only through video. I'd probably have gone out of the car and just gazed in a shocked awe at some of those houses...really teaches you to value every little thing you have, not gonna lie.  So glad LTT andCraft Computing came through to help out! Poor guy needs a bit of TF2 after whitnessing what had happened, not gonna lie.
Are you going to go over to floatplane soon?
Dude love your content soooo much!
something reminds me of ian mcollum
That just made my day
@Linus @LTT When the pendamic is over invite this dude for scrapyard wars!
Wholesome, this dude reaction is priceless!
This video has more LLTStore.com plugs than an actual LTT video
Nice this was great to see
What a great collaboration! It is great to see things like this, especially in 2020. Cheers to both you and Linus for making this happen, and a lot of respect for the road trip to deliver it in person.
Jeff: LTTstore.com Me: smashes like button
3 hour drive....sunday drive here in texas lol, glad he got a new computer.
5:27 - Woooow, fuck man :(
The average redditor
uses reddit, looks like he uses it too
I LOVE THE LTTSTORE.COM PLACEMENT!
This just made me happy

Dude I really enjoyed watching this video , keep up the good work , nice to see humanity up close and personal  , cheers 🍻
Son: Dad, what is this crap bracket? Dad: Sit, son, I have a story to tell you.
big boyy
Good call on muting the music for the bit in the burnt down area
Nice work by Linus. 👍👍👍👍
Restored my faith in humanity!
This is nice, good job guys
As soon as I saw him I thought discord moderator definitely
I got chills when he pulled into the wrecked neighborhood.  Good deeds make me happy. Well done fellas!
GREAT TO SEE.
The side of the community most will never see or understand.   *Insert feels*
Awesome Video!!! 😍😍😍 People helping People is awesome! 🤟🏽
U get subscriber for the trip 8 hour trip
Pcmr really is a great community
Australians and Oregonians have the same idea of a "short trip".
He can now play cyberpunk 2077
fuck, all those burnt houses... it's a really heart wrenching scene I swear.
"Rather pleased for having this" man i would be crying my as* off
5:13 nice learned from the best
"will it run tf2?" AAAAAAAAAAAAAA ❤️😖
Great collaboration for an incredible reason. Thank you all!
Lttstore.com
You don't neeed to say lttstore.com after showing th bottle. We say that ourselves 😂😂😂
Where I live: a 3,5 hour drive means I can visit 3-4 countries other than my own. America: "just up the road"
He pulgs the ltt store
Just awesome.
Nice video, and you managed to fit in the obligatory "ltt store.com"  and "that's what she said" soundbites 😂😂.  I really like the collabs you guys in the YouTube community do especially when it's for a good cause and well you have got at least 1 new subscriber out of it 😉
cpu cooler went on without thermal paste  :|
it is both nice and Cringy at the same time. surreal af
I imagined spencer to be exactly like that
Hahaha 285 miles is just up the road? I'm from Portugal and the southern and northern most point are 294 miles apart 😂
Huge linus fan so of course I had to watch this video after seeing part one. Also being in Oregon myself I felt good knowing that you care about the community and reported back on mask usage. I have subscribed. I dont get to watch as much youtube as I use ever since I started streaming and doing occasional youtube videos I will try to keep up
Subscribed so you can go git your own 2080 super
How do you sound more Canadian than all the LTT staff combined? :D :D   Seriously though this was great. Spencer was nervous and nearly speechless with that new PC but I'm sure he'll love it.
Y'all did something beautiful guys love it so generous
Ha Oregon is small xD only 185 miles? I take trips every couple weeks to Dallas from Houston (240 miles) and make it in 3ish hours maybe a little less And I only stay for 1 day usually xD
nice video
Nice to see a Linus collab - though I still think a drunken pc build would be better. Though cant risk Linus dropping beer everywhere!
goddamnit I was not expecting the lttstore segue lmao
Thumbs up, just for this awesome lttstore.com plug ! xD
5:11 Respect.
Great story, well done guys
This is so heart warming
Congratulations Spencer.
LTTstore.com
💜💜💜
You guys are doing great things!
woot woot oregon! Albany here!
We get the same sort of Bushfires around where I live in Australia, the devastation is so confronting seeing it in person, well done Jeff and the crew at LTT.. oh and loved the LTT store promo.
amidst of worse 2020, we can say that this is the heart of gamers. "Slow Clap" LTT & Craft Computing.
no fat shaming guys....fleease
Most of those fires were arson
This video is sponsored by...  LMG
did his granma have a brick house ?
Disney : Avengers Endgame is the most ambitious crossover in history. Craft Computing : Hold my beer.
does he have a tuner seat in his car?
Man, this story is both sad and wholesome at the same time
This is kinda crazy to see considering i live about 30 min drive from talent. I was in eagle point when this shit went down we thought our house was gonna go aswell. There was a fire just up the road from me.
Omg I live in Salem too lol 😂
5:14 Lttstore.com 🔥🔥
Big respect to you guys.... Cc snd ltt
Seeing the devastation and ruined homes is just heart breaking. Imagine suffering such loss and then receiving a gift like this. Nice one guys 👍🏻
Damn linus even gets store plugs on other peoples channels now!
This is a great thing you and LTT teamed up on. The community's ability to come together when one of our own gets knocked down never ceases to amaze.  And I know that area pretty well. Recognized the 5S freeway out of Salem. Driven it many many times the past couple years visiting family up there. To see the level of devastation around that area, especially the scorched trees at the @5:15 mark, is borderline traumatic. I actually drove home to California through Medford not 15 hours before the fires broke out in southern Oregon.  Anyway, thanks for being a great steward of the community.
Hell yeah Salem for the win, it's an alright place depending on the part you live in. Down town Salem kinda sucks nowadays because the homeless are absolutely everywhere
Good vibe video, be safe everyone...
Hey  man, my brother knows you, hung out at your place for some gaming, he says you’re a pretty cool dude!  What you and Linus have done is very heart warming and super awesome.  Thank you for your awesome content !
Subscribed 😎😁👍
Bro I live in Salem as well, lol. Hello fellow Salemer
So was Spencer not insured or something?.. Or is he getting two pcs?.
I applaud you both, Linus and Jeff. After literally loosing everything Spencer must have been really down but here comes the gaming and tech community to lift the man back up. I hope others who have suffered loss remember you are not alone. Compassion and kindness always arrives in the darkest hours.  Thank you Linus and Jeff for being who you are. All the best Spencer and we'll see you in-game brother!
absolutely brilliant LTT store plug, had to pause the video I was laughing that much
5:15 Herbie.
Why Linus didn't sell it to him? xdd
Happy gamer happy day
Pog mentioned Oregon I live in Eugene
I live in Oregon and I only ever see people wearing chin diapers.
Awesome
came straight here after Ltt. heart breaking the fires have destroyed our beautiful state.
It warms my heart to hear there is an Oregonian pc building channel. selling and buying isn't so easy even with portland.
4:30 LOL I live in the Netherlands and that is the distance from the top to the south of the Netherlands lol
What a great story and thanks for bringing light into such dark situation. Wish you all the best! Greetings all the way from Sweden.
Legend.... *breathes in*
Spece lost his entire house but at least he has a new pc woo he can sit on the side of the road and play now
"Up the road".... 3 hours ago... what?
"Do you think it'll run TF2?" When I heard that I almost cried. I LOVE THAT GAME.
I moved from near Salem, OR to the Midwest last year, and I have an uncle who lived in my grandparents home near Talent that was also lost in the fires. It was really nice to see a bit of that familiar drive and even nicer to see this collaboration to make the tragedy a little less painful for somebody.   Thank you!
3.5 hours is west coast close. Good on ya'll.
He really deserved it, great you helped.
Lttstore.com 🤣🤣
"Ya think it'll run tf2?" Gamer moment.
thats wonderful Linus wanted to help! I'm glad spencer got a new rig! Happy Computing!
Is it some universal law that whenever you hold an LTT bottle you must say "LTTstore.com"
300 kilometres...
I'm wondering how much Linus paid this guy to pimp his water bottles....
I responded to those fires and I lived in Talent. I saw the devastation it brought first hand and I just wanted to thank you for doing what you did. So many people I know lost everything to those fires and I know how great of a difference this will make to the receiver.
This guy is so nice WTF
This is the best kind of wholesome.
Love the "LTTstore.com" plug, Hope he paid you for that!
Great show of humanity! Spencer's even got a gaeming monitah, now :)
Well done to all involved!
Nearly choked to death on the spit-take from the unexpected LTTStore.com spot on a different channel. Worth it.   EDIT: Also just realized that I subscribed to you ages ago (circa the Wish GPU era) and since the bell wasn't a thing back then I forgot you existed. I really loathe that edition to the platform.
I love this <3
Will I get one of those if I burn my imaginary gaming PC since I don't have one???  :(
Good on you guys.
LTTstore.com
I love your channel
Anyone who shills out LTTstore.com gets a subscribe
5:14 I gotta say nice segue to the LTT store water bottle but damn and I'm glad that Spencer is gonna get a new PC I'm happy for him coming from a fellow gamer that lost his unhackable windows 7 rig to a hulk (it was a Dell and everything is stock just for the sake of argument)
I noticed 1 thing in the build video, Linus didnt even drop or knock over 1 part! That living up the road thing being 185 miles is insane, I'm deep in Germany while I live in the Southwest of the Netherlands if I travel that distance lol.  Great effort by LTT with collab of Craft Computing to at least give an unlucky person a smile on his face.
Lmaoooo the ltt store had me week
Karen's: People on the internet are evil. People on the internet:
Linus, I'm broke. Welp!
Came from ltt video. Everything has been crazy. I'm in utah. Our neighbors to the west are on fire. The east is under water. And here in utah the winds are ripping stop lights out of the ground. It's enough to make anyone cry.
"lttstore dot com", love it :D
don't be okay with 99% success with masks
Hit the like button when you snuck in the water bottle at LTTstore.com. Laughed when the fan did the same thing!
US custom unboxed the monitor but didn't make a video, disappointing.
And I live in indepence
This made me feel awesome, I love this. Something good happened in the world, happy gaming Spencer!
I live in Oregon I was amazed that my home is featured in a video and it is cool we could some day meet and I have been needing a pc so could I pay you to build me one
Anyone else think he was gonna get on the road and crack open a root beer 😂
5:28 the grass was still green, but not 10 feet away was burned to the ground. Damn.
I drove from prineville to Portland around the time all the fires started. Was no joke scary. Good for him getting a replacement tho 👍
Salem is a good place to live :D
LTT store.com . . . . . it makes it everywhere cant escape it
This made me smile so much
8:17 i hear tf2
lmao the LTTstore.com plug really got me
Hey, just a request... Don't call the fires 'wildfires', the Ashland, Talent, and Phoenix fires were half arson, half probably arson. They weren't 'wild', the initial fire started in Ashland when a person allegedly committed suicide, and a second person set a secondary fire in Phoenix, in an attempt to make it worse.  Regardless of that, awesome job teaming up with LTT, nice to see someone got some of their stuff replaced. :D Was nice seeing the upgraded graphics card, too. I hadn't expected that.
How good is the 2080 super?
When Linus said “luckily he lives right up the road from him” in his video, I thought they literally happened to live on the same street.  *Cut to 185 mile drive*
lttbottle.craft (edit: also: houses built with cardboard... you know the story... eventually, _some_ people will remember foreign concepts like bricks)
It's all really nice that everyone was able to come together and replace that kids PC. But lets be honest, this last couple of weeks where he was without one was probably the last glimmer of hope for his health and social life. I really can not condone the enabling of chronically obese people to continue their current lifestyle of anti-social binge eating. That kid isn't even 20 and he could have a heart attack next week. And yes it actually is my business because obesity is the greatest burden on our healthcare system
i hope you get him a new mounting bracket, using the old one was sketchy as hell. what if a flake falls off and causes a short?
Driving into that suburb with all the burnt houses - that was full on. Being Australian, it reminded me of the major fire damage during our summer (December 2019, January 2020). So terrible!  Stay safe to everyone up in Oregon!
Just watched the LTT video that linked me here. I had no clue this guy was in Oregon. As a Oregonian I couldn't help but smile :)  Not gonna lie though, if the fires had reached here in Portland I would have grabbed my pc when I evacuated xD  Also I didn't think you could drive another 3 hours south of Salem, but to be fair when I'm down that far that south I'm usually in Newport.
LTT STORE . COM
Hey, you're in oregon. Whats up oregon fam, im guessing you're in Albany or Salem? Eugene here
Your mask rocks!
Using the salvaged mounting bracket from the old PC was such a nice touch.
*Everyone liked that*
As someone in Oregon. I never want to experience fires like that ever again. I’m happy to see some good happen in such dark times.
this was really cool. thanks to you guys for being awesome.
The best type of collaboration
When he turned into that housing development... damn.
You guys are awesome! glad to see the pcmr community come together and help some of our brothers and sisters out with some of the devastating shit that's happening around the world to make life a little better!
lttstore.com
This is why I am proud to be a part of PCMR!
I just drove through Phoenix and talent last weekend my girlfriend lives in Ashland and I live in Portland it was the first time I had been down there since the fire and wow ed. I can't believe how much was destroyed. The worst I'm sure you can't even see from the road which is all the further I went but the amount of people who have lost so much is unreal
185 miles away???? Man that's a whole nother country for Europe lol.
Spencer the ultimate Chad specimen himself
Linus built a PC for Gaben. Free skins for everyone
at least something good kinda came from 2020. I think one thing they should have done was sign it I think that would have been the cherry on top.
New sub. Came over from LTT.  Incidentally, I live closer than Spencer does (Albany).
Who else came here after watching linus' vid
Dope.
6:53   ..... Caught the meme
So are we going to get Jeff on next season of Scrap Yard Wars?
PCMR is not a cult, its a brotherhood, power to you
Linus's LTT commercializing has even reached out to other Youtube channels. Soon will see it everywhere, even Daneboe from Annoying Orange.
5:25 Whoa, that sure took a grim turn there. Heart goes out to all those who lost their homes and businesses. And I'm not sure if lives were lost - I sure hope not, but they were, my prayers go out to them as well.
I was smiling the whole time he unboxed it. That is awesome he was able to get a new gaming setup
Good job Jeff. Happy to see people helping out fellow humans.
This is so amazing, good on you to bring some brightness to that kids life
Linus did a great job making a near perfect copy of this PC.
Awesome to see the gaming community do this
That's some wholesome fuckin content boys!
Good job man, way too kind of you, love the channel.
I need a good house fire right about now. Need an upgrade =).
It's really nice to see Canadians and our US friends do this kind of gesture. Happy gaming Spencer.
6:05 PLEASE TAKE NOTE: a lot of the surviving houses have metal roofs
And then they say games causes violence
Amazing story you guys. Your good people for everything you do for our fellow gamers. A+++
Thank you, good sir. I subscribed due to the good heart and camaraderie shown for a fallen brother.
Lmao "up the road"  Me (in Europe) and my friend (in the US) have had discussions about this difference in what is considered close. "up the road" for me is like 500 meters and here you are going "up the road" 180 miles, 3 hours and a highway.
THE TECH COMMUNITY! My people!! Love you all, this was wonderful.
i love u for this
the pc community has always been kinder as a whole than console, warms my heart
Damn that neighbourhood. Its heartbreaking. My best wishes to all the people there, hoping for a fast recovery.
I say an absolute massive kudos for organising this and taking the time to make the treck to deliver it. The world needs more people like yourself and Linus.
That PC can run TF2, Pog
Linus has trained me well. I hear "lttstore.com" and I instinctively give the video a like without thinking about it.
Im SO glad you got to do this man ive been following and watching your channel for so long now so its awesome seeing this!
5:20 Yet with all that fire ppl are still hoarding the remains of a Beetle from that fire
Is this guy Gabe Newells son he even asked if it can play tf2 what a Chad
He is fat. That explains redditors
seriously fuck the guy who almost definitely took u/sometimesluckychozo  Totally wasn’t me or anything
You guys deserve heaven
The reason why I love YouTube is because it facilitates great things, but yet we still get moments like 6:52
My faith in humanity has been restored!!!
Thanks bro for helping each other :)  this is so wonderful story, its not about who is send or who is build it but this is just kind of healing spell for the Spencer (sorry I don't know how to spell it)  Note : When the covid is ended hoped you will be driving Linus and his LTT Crew to spencer home and it will be fun in there
this is great, what a community
Heartwarming seeing Sometimes Lucky  His neighbourhood is just wild to see. It never gets easy seeing a whole neighbourhood leveled, the that one blue house with metal fence somehow lived fine I guess.  I guess this is going to just be a regular occurrence now. Unless we can somehow get everyone onboard to slow global warming down...
Wholesome
You and Linus out-did yourselves, Bravo!  👏
Sent here from Linus' channel. This is great. +1 sub. (lttstore.com)
Great video! A little bittersweet... pretty unsettling to see the remains of the houses. I hope these people manage to get back to their lives as soon as possible, including Spencer of course. But it was a great thing Linus and you did, I'm really glad you were able to reach out to him!
A++ product placement. got a good laugh.
You guys are awesome. That tone shift at at 5:25 was as dramatic as in the original Mulan.
Hey, you drove right through my town! Greetings from Roseburg!
Spencer, enjoy that mouse and keyboard. I have both, and was just as close to losing them. They are awesome.
Who else came here from linus?
Awesome compilation, good to see the world isn't full of heartless people! As another gamer at times, but an avid PC user, Congratz on the replacement PC, very sorry for your loss Spencer and anyone else affected by this disaster! There are far more than 1 person devastated, but for those that don't share, they hopefully had some kind of insurance to compensate them? I know my comment seems negative to think of those excluded, but I don't mean for it to be, just err brutally honest! No one expects a fire of this magnitude, nor do they expect to lose everything! I couldn't imagine!
That lttstore.com thing was awesome. Lol
Spencer dude sorry about your house. Glad all of these folks came together to hook you back up. Take it easy!
Ahhhh classic "that's what she said" love it!
Thank you you guys for doing this. I was feeling happy for him until you drove up to the neighborhood and tears start running. What devastation!  Good luck to Spencer. God bless!
I came, I saw and I subscribed.
This is awesome. Great teamwork getting this man his machine. Truly awesome job.
LTT store  dot com confirmed!  Lol I cried i laughed so hard! Don't let Linus corrupt you!!
Judging by his neighborhood I've concluded that he lives in DayZ
You and Linus are awesome for doing this. You could see the look of joy on the guys face even though he was in a mask
Didn’t realize you were a fellow Oregonian; awesome to see the tech community coming together to do something good! Keep up the great work, and condolences to those affected by the Oregon Wildfires; I have friends who have been impacted, and have heard incredible stories from people stopping by my workplace. Stay strong!
he needs that double chin mask attachment
Bottle: shows up Anybody: lttstore.com
I love that you guys joined forces for such an awesome thing. Jeff you are a mensch!!! LTT are amazing. So so brilliant you guys did this.
Dude I sure hope you got paid a pretty penny to do this lol.
TLDR   "... lttstore.com"
LTTSTORE .COM LMAO nice
How is it everything's destroyed but the roads are completely immaculate?  So weird.
I honestly teared up watching this. So glad to see people help others in these times. glad he also has a place to stay .
very touching, Good job @Craft Computing and @Linus Tech Tips
Great job seeing you guys working together to help the little guy =)  Just a few years ago we had wildfires raging very near my hometown here in Sweden, a lot of the forest burned down but thankfully only about 30 houses burned down in the 40 square miles area.
First
this is amazing, awesome to see this!
Being a fire victim myself of the 2011 slave lake fire in Alberta Canada and loosing everting i owned.....showing all the destruction of the fire and nothing was left standing it really hit home and made me realize the pc community is so kind when it comes to helping others.
Socks n sandals sent me here.
seriously one of the best colabs ever !  thanks for helping spencer ....and as always ...LTTstore.com!!
I just subscribed because of this great video!
Shameless Merch plugs. Love it. HAH. LTTstore.com
4:30 i died hahahaha
Oh man.  I'm right next door in Idaho.    We have been chocking on the oregon smoke 😢 we drive through oregon frequently and seeing the devastation makes it real.  About to drive through northern oregon next week.  Your awesome for doing that
so awesome of yall to do this for him, what a great community
I'm glad that you and Linus did things this way..  I also hope that this is the turning point of spencer's luck! And that he can enjoy many wonderful hours on his new pc!
Craft Computing and LTT, nice work guys! 👍
"Think it will run TF2?" what a fucking lad
Omg a TF2 player
This is awesome dude you got a new subscriber and I look forward to seeing other great things from you!
While it might only be physical possessions, I can’t imagine the trauma he’s endured. It really was mind blowing seeing the neighborhood burnt out.  I’m relieved to see people helping him though. I hope it makes his journey a little easier.  A good reminder that we’re all in this together. When someone is having a bad day, that’s a call for us as humans to step up.
When he first got there.. 😲Damn that's messed up! So much destruction! Really nice of you guys to do this!
that line "a neighbour by the south" haha. bdw, just subbed sent by linus haha
This made me feel something. I needed this this year. Also holy shit Linus just gave you a huge boost to your channel. What an awesome thing and man thanks for driving this to him and I can't wait to see what videos are in store for this channel as you gained a sub.
dude seeing him be genuinely happy with literal ashes behind him is so heartwarming yet breath taking. I hope Spencer is doing alright now, and I personally want to thank Linus and Craft Computing for helping him out. This is amazing.
🥰
Spencer sounds like a standup guy lmao
Great to See a fellow Oregonian!  Especially from Salem!  Respect!!
This video is so wholesome!
Cheers to Craft Computing and Linus for doing this. Awesome sauce.
I'm 100% sure I subscribed a really long time ago and now I'm not?? WTH?
Liked and subbed. LTTstore.com
Damn even LLT STORE invaded this channel lol
for the front fan cables i would have had the cable leads going in the same direction in the case for a cleaner look, you can always remove the sticker and reapply if you wanted too on the fan hub lol
God bless ya on that 3 hour drive. I used to have to drive 2 1\2 hrs to get to our colo and I hated it.
Think it’ll run TF2? LOL!
Lttstore.com 😂😂😂 subscribed!
always debated on subscribing. this took my click.  I love the PC community!
Linus: "Lives right up the road from him"  9:05 3 hour drive?!!
Nice!
Oregon: *Rains* Oregon at the same time: *Wildfires*
<3 <3 <3
u guys have no idea what something like this means to a wildfire victim. I personally had to go through the camp fire back in 2018 CA and was very lucky to not lose my home.
Hey Spencer, not sure if you are gonna see this, but I am down in southern oregon too! If you need anything, just lmk. I got tons of spare cables and can help you trouble shoot anything! Stay strong my friend, we can rebuild!
This is so cool that you did this for Spencer. Seems a genuinely good guy, could see him holding back tears.  Seeing all those burned out homes breaks my heart. Each one represents a family who have lost everything.
Thanks Siri Garmin. 3hours
Hahaha lttstore.com lol
good Collab with LTT.
One of the best things I’ve seen in 2020 💯👍
Of course he plays TF2, that made me emotional, a fellow tf2er, all the good luck to him with his new build and I hope everything goes well.
F
5:10 lttstore
You sir, are a legend (lmg too ofc)
:D
A PC Youtuber in Salem? What??? Didn't think one was so close.
Wow, shilling for Linus are we?
good vibes
This was really heartwarming. You don't see that often from tech channels. 10/10
THE GOATS :D :D : D
You got a new Sub.
It really is heartbreaking to see so many home lost. You and Linus did a good thing for a fellow PCMR. That's the kind of USA/Canada relation i like to see. Subbed and cheers from up north!
So cool what this community can do together.
I live outside Portland. It was heart breaking to watch the sky turn yellow and orange. Watching the beachie creek fire destroy homes was terrible, and having a fire at a nearby lake was terrifying.
Fucking brilliant guys, good stuff. You guys are cool as hell for doing this.
lol 2080 super
im not crying, you are!!, awesome video
Is there a merch store I’m missing?? I love your logo!!
Did this man really just plug LttStore.com XD
hell yeah spencer let's goooo
awesome video and nice truck!!
Some of us are Beavers,  others are Ducks,  but we are all Oregonians. My family up in the Silver Falls area lost 40 acres of Christmas trees before the wind shifted with the fire half a mile from their house. You don't need to build a PC to help those that lost more than trees. I donated my TV, desk and chair to a charity that's helping people that lost homes rebuild.
Good to see a felow oregonian helping each other out!
What camera was that I saw you holding up?
Saving a life, leads to saving more, regardless whether animate or inanimate
My hats off to all you guys! So cool of you guys to help a fellow gamer. Take care Spencer. Game on braddah!!
I follow both of you guys and this is why.  Honestly good people in the tech community.
I just picked up my singularity d5 pump in Salem. I knew you were a fellow Oregonian.
Why can’t I get away from the LTT store water bottle?? It’s like the universe is giving me a sign. 😂
Seeing Spencer get his new PC was way cooler than watching that linus guy drop craft computing's name on his build video.
You guys made this guys year.  The loss from a fire is unimaginable, giving him a replacement PC was one of the nicest things I've ever seen.  You guys are amazing.
great job helping the community. also i live in Oregon the fires are so bad my uncle and ant got evacuated and lucky none near my house. dont stop!
Gotta say I loved the driving montage. Oregon is a beautiful state when it's not on fire.
Love the Lttstore.com plug
Redditor seen on irl
TF2 POGGERS
Oh, I see he is a man of culture 8:18
Wholesome
Love you for this. Driving 3 and a half hours one way to give someone a fresh PC out of the kindness of your heart. Love it, thanks for doing this. Spencer, if you're out there reading this, best of luck to you and your family. The wildfires are so so awful, especially during a pandemic.
at 06:10 looks like Fallout 4 ???
Great video! Subbed because of Linus!
Thats awesome.
Great job by you and Linus! Bravo! 👏 👏 👏
Ayye Salem Oregon born and raised! Very cool there's a tech YouTuber here! Lol
Seriously, how can the 100 or so people who shamefully did so, DOWNvote a video of generosity? What an awesome collaboration. I have a friend who lives in Portland. Things have been so awful out there. So kind of you and Linus Tech Tips to go together on this
sanna ol
what a great gesture doing this, there's hope for humanity yet...
Shameless the way the bottles gets plugged
LTT STORE DOT COM
so its it just like a thing no matter if ur a Youtuber or not to promote LTT.com
This is the kind of positivity we need in the world this year. You and Linus are great people
Sent by LTT, but already a long time sub :)
Aye a Salemite, hello neighbor.
Never seen any video with likes 25% of its view count. Came here to say hi from LTT!
This is so holesome. Great job guys
taking a whole day out to drive down or up and personally deliver a PC is amazing! well done to you all guys!
The LTT store plug though
something seems sus. how are there wildfires when there is rain on your windshield?
+
Literally crying. Both in happiness and sadness. Well done.
Only two words...  Heart warming
You pulled onto where all the building burned and it was a little hard to watch
185 miles of love :)
The scary thing for us here in Australia is that, despite how bad the fires get in California from the Australian gums, or the Oregon fires, we have a country full of Eucalyptus trees. What you call the worst fire in history is a general summer blaze for us.
You really have to wonder how many of these fires were started by Antifa or BLM rioters.
I audibly gasped when I saw the burnt down houses like holy crap that's devastating
I swear I was already subbed but I guess I'll do it again for good measure.   +1 for being a pc bro and helping a fellow gamer out (as well as Linus yes).
I buckle up my camera gear to keep it safe Edit: in the car
This video got me in the feels. Love the logo for your channel.
I was like all about the pc but when i saw the place omg! I was in shock!
5:29 oof 5:41OOF
5:14 Smoooth. =P
makes me wish that i had the space and money to buy up some of those burned out cars and turn them into gaming pods.
I got sent here by the LTT video but now you sent me back to that video again and I don’t know what to do now
What nice fellows, all of you Sometimes the internet is a good thing
The LTTstore.com plug was priceless!
5:27 just. no. words. :(
But wait...what were you drinking?
LTT: "He lives just up the road..."  Driving 180 miles (290 km) here in central Europe could potentially make you cross 4 different countries, speaking 3 different languages...  Makes it only more awesome that you guys did this!  But next time, rake the damn forest!
You Dudes are so cool Ima almost crying(I am).....There are still good people in this world...Thanks!!!!
Stick shift? Nice
Spencer is awesome
This is awesome. I love how it feels almost coincidence that I've watched you since the beginning and we still get to see more and more awesome stuff every time. Keep at it!  Edit: I actually saw this before the LTT vid so I was unsure what you meant when you kept saying "as Linus said" oops!
*This is so wholesome from both of you* Must be so awful for people to go through losing their homes because of fires and also having to deal with the covid-19 situation at the same time. Sąd thing is, that these kind of natural disasters (wildfires, hurricanes, floods etc) are only going to get worse because of climate change and loads of people, like we see currently, are going to suffer as a result. :(  Anyway, stay safe everyone ❤️
I work for a company that owns one of the parks in southern Oregon that was completely lost in the fire (https://www.gofundme.com/f/almeda-drive-fire-relief-for-bear-lake-estates) and I live not far from Salem (about 10 miles east) so I have made that drive many times before and it is one exhausting drive.  Spencer seemed so grateful for the PC, it's heart warming to see, especially in 2020 when it seems like a constant stream of bad news.  Also, a tech YouTuber in my backyard, I had to subscribe!
That scenery on your way to Spencer is really beautiful... I mean the mountein etc.
Spencer kinda looks like Gaben
What a great video, kudos for driving 3 hours each way to get this PC to him - Linus undersold that a bit. Like your content so have a sub from me - look forward to future videos 🙂
What a great collaboration and way to draw attention to the vass range of needs fire victims are facing
Bold of you to assume this PC can handle TF2
The LTT video got a comment and a Like.. Better drop those off here as well.
LTTSTOREDOTCOM
I really love that you guys did this for some one in such a hard time, covid has ruined a lot of my summer plans but thats nothing compared to a disaster like this. My heart goes out to you guys and i hope that things get better for everyone!! This makes me proud to be a part of such a great community! lttstore. com
Great feel good story. Great way to support each other.
Bravo to everyone involved! This was soul shatteringly heartbreaking. It's wonderful to see that a ray of hope and prosperity can shine even in the darkest of days! Spencer, if you are reading this, I am praying for you and your family. You seem like a really cool dude and I'm happy to see how upbeat you are, even after devastation.
I think I would be stoked knowing jeff was showing up.
really appreciate you guys going the extra mile (literally) for a fellow enthusiast, this of course earned you a sub, and hello from the redwoods! (Eureka CA)
1. It's a shame the fires. Here in Chile we had the same thing on jan-2018 and it was crazy. Good to see something good come for this dude who lost almost everything 2. As a long time fan of this channel I'm so happy to see you it the big leagues and do a collaboration video with Linus. 3. I would encourage every one of the new visitors to see some videos on this cannel, I really like when we have fun in your videos and then you review some beer. 4. LTT store dot com
That’s an awesome move
That reminds me of the 2 trips I took with my church after Katrina.  Just devastation as far as the eye can see.  But you guys are awesome for doing this.  It's always nice to be reminded that there are people out there being excellent to one another.
Lttstore.com.  For sure.
Drought = Nestle water company
Glad to see people coming together to help others in a time of need. We need more of this.
If that's not worth the sub I don't know what it is.
Good mask work boys.  Keep it up.
This just goes to prove any collab with LTT must have some mention of LTT store. Holy fuck is this heart warming though
Nice lad.  Very decent thing to do for him after such a terrible experience.
God bless you Jeff.
Bruuuh, gg for doing this.
I have done that drive dozens of times. I'm in the Midwest now, but lived, worked and went to School in SO.  Nice to see you guys do a lil' something for a community member. Can't believe the carnage from the fires this year.
linus and you man its so awesome to see big aand small channels who will go this far out of there way to help out so much
i live close to where this happened nothing of mine burned i was lucky but a lot were not. cool to see this specially as a local. subbed.
Thank you for being Humans in the community!
Both you and Linus did a very good thing ,,,,,, Cheers!
avarge Redditer
I was expecting Spencer to be a 10 year old kid not a full grown dude
Wow.. just wow. I‘m glad that Spencer has got noticed by LTT, so they could build him a new pc. ♥️
7:00 You cant see his mouth but his chin sure is smiling
i live in eugene, and god did i suffer through the 400+ air quality. it sucked. i just want to thank you and LTT for doing this for someone, both as a person, and as military veteran.  if i was to lose my computer i would probably end up in a mental ward due to military stuff.  again, thank you both fir this act of compassion!  *salute*
That was so awesome of you guys! Sucks about Oregon and those people who lost their homes. I feel your pain as I live in NorCal.
Sub. Earned.
lttstore.com hhaahhahahha
This is great, good man!
So now we know what the average Redditor looks like.
1.1 million acres burned? Amateur numbers in California. Still sucks though.
That was awesome.
Linus sent me - :)
Time to start rebuilding with brick and mortar? Hope everyone is safe and get on being awesome again very soon. Fly with her own wings!!
That dude sees the old mounting bracket in one glimpse, the memories are harsh, never go off mind Thanks LTT and Craft Computing for making dude happy again
chunky
New subscriber = me :D
You da MVP, subscribed!
That one guy at the rest stop needed smacked. lol
Man that face mask was way too small for him lol :)
It’s always great to see the PCMR community come together for one another!!
Nice work guys
This was an awesome thing for you guys to do. Craft Computing (and Spencer) certainly gained a new fan here.
As someone who is new to the pc community it really warms my heart to see this small but noble act of kindness. Keep up the great work guys!
Dude I may just be high but when he put on his mask at 06:24, I immediately forgot what he looked like underneath.   This is my first video of his.
nice to see this
Respectable deed
"Lives just down the road" i guess im canada someone that lives 100 Miles+ away is still considered a neighbor!
As someone in the UK, I have never seen wildfires like that before and it was shocking to see. My thoughts for everyone caught up in this tragedy and it’s so heartwarming to see the kindness of others in the gaming world. Respect to you and LTT.
Wholesome af... little tears for the bro.
Everyone here from Linus' channel needs to throw Craft Computing a sub. 👼
so many love on this single video... kudos to you great sir...
As a fellow Oregonian who has also given away their last shirt to help someone, thank you for your compassion and empathy!  Subscribed and will patiently wait to buy some of shirts to give as gifts.
All the love and best wishes from Australia mate! I hope that the community and environment bounce back as soon as possible. 👍👍👍👍👍
i guess mask kinda suck when you dont have a chin
Y'all are really nice for doing this
So happy for spencer
This is just brilliant! Bravo guys for doing this for him. Quite a wake-up call seeing the houses like that 😢
This is really heartwarming... and also really really sad.
Would love to see you and LTT collab again in the future.
Im here from LTT channel to see u unbox this lol
Linus said "lets send it to craft computing, hes just down the road"😂🤣🤣😂 185 miles is just down the road now i guess lmfao
Careful there with the jokes Craft, he's still a Redditor. :-P
Huh, in all this time watching your videos I never realized your just south from me!  I’m about 40 miles south of Seattle, WA.  Hope you guys are doing alright down there!
This is awesome!!
Ayo if your reading comments Spencer my steam is dhiscock.2001 add me on steam
Good guy stuff here! USA needs more good guy stuff! Bravo sir. Bravo! 🤘
Awesome!!!!!!!
Wow yep this big boy is a gamer. Totally believable. 😉
Spencer is a real Redditor. *tips fedora*
This is so wholesome
He looks like that guy that works in ltt. He looks like his kid
Awesome job guys. Incredible showing what our hobby can do is difficult times.
Love how the LTT waterbottle is still making an appearance
Who the fuck disliked this video? Fuck them.
Such a beautiful thing to do for this gamer! Good work!
To those who disliked. Shame on you.
5:12 DAMN IT LINUS! 🤣🤣🤣👍
LTT Store dot com
Well done dude. Spencer seems like cool guy. Sub and bell activated.
Hey Craft, a couple years ago when I just started getting into PC building I watched a whole bunch of your videos, along with so many others from other channels that it's all just a blur now. Somehow I wasn't subscribed, so this is the perfect re-introduction to your great work. Thank you for making the world a better place...cheers.
Honestly, I don't think I've seen your content before but as soon I as I saw/heard the LTT Store plug I knew I had to subscribe.
How have you manage it to cooperate with LTT!? 🤯
My heart aches for the people in oregon. Stay strong and do what you can to prevent forest fires.  also good job on delivering the computer to a random stranger on the internet, bless you man. Subbing because you seem like you know your stuff just as much as linus does
A real "feel good" vid for "Sometimes" Lucky. Thanks for pairing up with Linus! You guys really helped out a guy that needed a break from what he was dealt.
Damn that’s a lot of destruction, heartbreaking to see all those homes completely destroyed!So cool that you guys did all this! 💪🏻
This makes me happy 🥺
Sometimes these kind of things makes me to look forward for a better life! You guys did a great job! Bravo and shoutout to Linus! Mainly Jeff for traveling 180miles!
Spencer looks like such a chill guy
Wow, Spencer is ripped!!
You sir are awesome.
got to love how Linus still got his "lttstore.com" mention
RainX on that windshield! Cool....
"right up the road"
Goddammit, Rachel!
LTTSTORE.COM
Atleast spencer gets to say his house is lit af
LTTStore.com 😂
at least some good news, cheer up buddy
Tf2 does not really use the graphics card all that much it likes the cpu and/or gpu
This is why i love the gaming comunity
You guys did a really great thing <3
That was so wholesome
"This is my state, this is where I was born and... a gamer has lost his pc. That just not acceptable"
How does the community that contains the most toxic people I've met  is so wholesome at the same time. What you did guys is simply amazing you restored my faith in humanity
2080SuperLuckyChozo  Now get off the games and lets clean this mess up! Grats dude.
Well dam. Thought I had another tech channel to watch. Then he had to open his mouth about masks. So nope
very touching... The devastation reminds me of our  bushfires in Australia...
5:10 I'm ded
An absolute champion of the people
this was such a cool project for all three of you
So, the LTT store merch plugs are contagious and spread by the water bottles... Got it...
This is one of the nicest things I have ever seen!
Somebody probably held a gender reveal party and burnt a large portion of Oregon.
The gaming community at it's finest, hope you have fun on your new rig, and great work guys. Also, didn't know this channel existed and now I do. *subscribed*
That LTT store shout out was really well-placed 👏 👌  Great collaboration work and for a great cause Good to see the pc community help each other out.
The bass in the car section tho
lttstore(dot)com  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Congrats to you Spencer! Enjoy buddy!
this was really cool!
who are the 81 assholes that thumbs downed this video.  COME AT ME BRO
Coming from Australia this is a sight I wish I wouldn't have to see again.
#LTTSTORE.COM
That booger in your nose was mesmerizing. Nice job highlighting it.
*Everbody liked this.
I really didn't expect that LTT store segway
i wonder how many times hes hit his head on that celling fan light >.>
The ltt store.com spots got out of hand😂 And no you are crying. It's so great to see the pc masterrace coming together ❤️
so happy for this guy!
Very cool thing you did.
MY BOY PLAYS TF2. GOOD MAN.
Well done 👍
Linus style ltt plug xD Tf2 ay. Great game too bad its owned by volvo.
Dude like yeah nice thing you did but no one knows who you are
the LTT store ad got me good lmao
He looks stupid happy
only sad the facemask blocked his face partly.
I have seen what a fire can do to a neighborhood in person only once. It's kinda disturbing. More so when you know the people living there. It's really cool that you guys teamed up to do this though.
I love the LTE store ad it had me laughing so much!
Linus sent me
Where you live has just over double of my country's entire population (Faroe Islands)
nice 5:06 & 8:52
This is super cool of you and ltt to do awesome thing 👏
just watched Linus's video, very cool of you guys to help a brother out and gift him a gaming rig.
Subbed not only for the mad respect for doing this but also for the lttstore plug. Good stuff mate!
and he included a rtx 2080 in it, wich even I don,,,,, yes it has got a rtx 2060 in it just like I told.
Spencer may not have been lucky but he was fortunate to have two great computer enthusiast youtube channels come to his aid. A Incredible collaboration.. Well done!!
“Why are we still here? Just to suffer? Every night, I can feel my leg… and my arm… even my fingers. The body I’ve lost… the comrades I’ve lost… won’t stop hurting… It’s like they’re all still there. You feel it, too, don’t you?”
Feels good man. So glad to be fans of LTT. Spencer seems like a super cool dude.
The lttstore.com ad made me laugh so hard
Such a great story. Love the PC YouTube community coming together for this.
Nice to see nice people being nice, thanks for this :)
Holy shit CraftComputing looks really angry. Greetings from LTT
Wrong side of the table dude..
4:40 Love to see someone using Rain-Ex on their windows. Highly recommended if you don't.
lttstore.com
I actually gasped when I saw the devastation in the area that that Spenser lives in the video from Craft Computing. With all the strife and conflict in the country now, this was a class act from both content creators.
A real tear jerker I just imagine my kid having his PC and his entire home cooked like that is just sad.  A little bit of normal will definitely make a difference!
You're just as bad as Linus at hawking the "store" . Keep it up!
Thanks m8 for putting a little good in all this loss.
A 3 hour tour....a 3 hour tour.   The Weather started getting rough.    Question....Did he lose his house to the fire,   or was that inside his house ?
This is so great. I took a drive down to the holiday fire after 126 opened and the destruction is a punch in the gut. It's great to see folks helping each other rebuild. Hello from Springfield!
"just up the road" -linus
you can never escape the lttstore.com
Literally not watched any of your videos prior this one and i don't even care if you post any videos at all, you got a new sub just for how great of human beings you are
That was so heartbreaking to see the devastated area. But you certainly offered a ray of light. Awesome job to you and Linus!
Me asking google, how to make a computer murder look natural 😅
As a German, my reaction when the nav said "continue straight for 3h and 15 minutes" was "wait, that's like 600km" until I realised you had a speed limit,
Spencer is fat
What a wonderful Giant Man You guys saved his Mental state
From Linus one more sub lol 😂
LTTstore.com very good! 5:10
This is so heartbreaking. I'm based in Salem OR as well. The worst we have experienced here is the smoke turning the sky orange, and the air being too toxic to breath without an n95. I understood that the fires were destroying homes and even entire towns... But seeing it on camera? It hits differently: The reality of the situation suddenly takes a front seat. It reminds me of those old nuclear bomb test videos: there's nothing left but debris!  Spencer truly is a champ! He seems to be taking the loss of his home very well! He definitely deserves a new pc after all of this. My heart goes out to you dear neighbor (And hey, maybe we can play TF2 sometime!)!
Gamers helping gamers. This is what our community should be. I am sorry this man lost his home, and im happy we can have him gaming a little bit to get his mind off these hard times.
Portland native here.. and ill tell you firsthand over a week of smoke was like hell opened up right in our backyard. the fires were no joke. alot of folks lost everything thru the fires. thanks to LTT for doin this!
160 miles in over 3hours? As a german i look at these 160 miles and wonder if i can make it in under 2 hours ;D USA, step your game up!
the LTT store plug from both of them.. lol
My heart sinks looking at what is left of that area. Reminds me of Fort Mac a few years ago. Really nice of your two channels to team up on this.
Rain going up the windshield?  RAINEX!  YES A FELLOW BROTHER IN THE RAINEX FAMILY FINALLY ON gamer YOUTUBE!
not a single comment about gender reveal parties?           *shame*
Good guy CraftComputing
What a cute fella! I'm sure he's still in shock -- the eye of Linus spied him. Now if we could, in the 21st century, just figure out this whole inferno issue...
Driving 8 hour round trip to deliver a PC? You just earned yourself a sub well done man
nice touch guys
Hey? How far are you? Hmm. Just down the road. I live near him  *Actually drives 100 miles*
Ltt sent me already love your videos I'm a fellow Oregonian from the small town of Scio giving some oregon love
Nice job guys :D
Great work getting the man gaming again.  I will click the sub button
Happy for you man you deserve it sucks to loose everything.
Good job
This is why I love the tech community, we can be pretty messed up sometimes with out petty fanboyism but we always come together to help one another out.
You and LTT have restored some of my faith in humanity! We need more people to be kind and help those less fortunate in life. I couldn't imagine losing everything I've built over the years in terms of clothing, possessions etc... Huge thumbs up to you both, absolute legends of the PC community. Mad respect.
how is there untouched house in the middle of all the burned ones? wtf
5:07 OK, even I’ll admit...this was slick🤣  The TechTuber community is a great community & always pitches in to help ppl in need. Awesomeness  Cheers✌🏼
All from a gender reveal fire😑
lttstore.com lol
yep that looks like a redditor to me.
You guys rock.
I mean u kinda told us about where Spencer lives. That’s bad.
You sound like Ian from Forgotten Weapons :D
This video gave me chills. So wholesome.  Thank you LTT, and you as well.! It may be small but you've earned my sub!
How the hell did Linus sneak LTTStore.com into the video, not once, but TWICE 😮
That LTTStore.com commercial had me subscribed to your channel! 😂
That was such a slap in the face of the scale of the fires.  Seeing the whole neighborhood gone is ridiculous.
I used to live in salem, ayyyy!  Edit: aww thanks for the heart! As a fellow Oregonian, i understand how "just up the road" could easily be a few hours or a few minutes, lol
weird wildfires I expected the surrounding trees also to be at least touched by the fire
This is great, enjoy your pc man!!
I'm really happy that you guys did that for him
Aww 🥰 this was a very touching video
I'm honestly starting to get triggered at the lttstore plugs.  Not your fault, but between Linus and Youtube, having the same product plugged over, and over, and over, and over is getting under my skin.
warms my heart
Came from LTT for the delivery. Stayed for the impromptu LTTStore.com ads.
love the LTT store plug!!
This is awesome
that was very nice of yall to do, that being said just for the mask plug at the end you will NOT be getting subbed by me . UNMASK AMERICA !!!!!!!!!!
5:15 punch buggy no returns!
My god Linus.. Is your goal to have every tech tuber using those bottles? Oh BTW... LTTStore.com Kapp
He has been trained in the right way
A fellow Oregonian I see. Mad respect
Awesome LTT and Craft computing 👌 , you doing a great job helping a PC gamer in need to get him a new computer ? 👍 .....  greetings from Hans of the dutch lowlands NL 😷
Enjoy that Spencer :)
damn your mask is so cool the best replica yet of kakashi's mask in naruto
I had to pee after the intro
So sad. Personalizing the wasteland. You see these kind of images all the time on the news.
welp he clearly looks like your typical redditor
Great video 👍🏻
You can tell he's a gamer, but he's also a very happy gamer.
Instead of gaming hé better do some excercise.
You guys did awesome!
when he sent it to linus i hope he labeled it "some assembly required" hell yea SlightlyLuckyChozo cant blame the hardware now, better grind those skills haha
He was so nervous, didn't know how to react. I really feel that haha
I hope you know that there is a special place in heaven for you.
Came here from the linus video and absolutely love your personality, instant subscribed!
Well done.
Calling all Gammers lets take a moment of Silent for the ol Gaming Rig that lost its life in the Oregon wildfire, R.I.P.
yo ahahah, ltt guys said you were a neighbour for spencer, that you were living in the same street ahahahah wtf are you talking about 185 miles away ahahah, what people do to help out fellow pcmr xd
❤️❤️❤️
man this is sick <3
This was such a great video. To see all those houses burned away. Man. I honestly got choked up a little bit.
Linus should send him a bicycle.
Sometimes life hits hard, and it was awesome that you and LTT could help hit back. Keep being awesome.
Man it must sucks ass to lose everything to fire. One day you have everything, next day it's just gone. Your room, your stuff, your house, your neighbourhood that you grew up, all the memories.Puff, up in the smoke. My grandparents lost their house from river erosion in 2014 and the entire neighbourhood. Now my mom doesn't have anything to look back into her childhood.
You guys rock!
It was just great
Down the road ;D
Heartwarming story. He might've lost his home. but hopefully didn't lose hope.
Sent by LTT.  Community together.  Reminds me of when Austin Evans lost his house to a fire.
niceeeeeee
Hadn't heard of your channel before today. Was getting choked up with Linus doing the rebuild, and by the time I finished this one, there were quite a few tears falling. You've gained a new sub, and I can't wait to dig into your back catalog. - Also your segway to LLT store dot com while driving was amazing: had me laughing so hard I had to rewind. It's awesome when people come together to help others.
what else did i expect the reddit user to look like. jokes aside really great video
respect
man i love the tech tuber community
That lttstore got me so badly. I paused the video so I can stop laughing.
Uncomfortable with looking at camera while driving
"Do you think it will run TF2?"  *He is a man of commitment, I wish all the best for him!*
Thanks, Linus and CC that was a very kind thing for you to do. Respect. No worries, I wasn't the victim just a third party who saw what you guyes did.
love that ltt store plug
respect
that was a wholesome video 😪
Nice to see something Kind and good come out of such a bad situation, Well done LTT and Craft :)
At least he wil game to pass that tragedy tho :')...
That name drop of LTTshop.com made me LOL for real.  Thank you for making my day.
That booger can't be unseen
When this video started , I was thinking, why drop a system to him he has no home... Or would need a ups...  See the housing, geee that's a mess.
I don't understand all houses are burned but the one in the middle survived How! Some poor construction on other houses?
I teared up.
I can relate to Spencer in some way since my old laptop is in ruins :( loved that guy <3
i love how linus's merch has turned into such a meme that other people plug it too
This puts a smile on my face. Good job guys! 🥳
6:44 Anthony windows version ...
This was Awesome, good karma all around.
Linus sent me. Great work by Linus and you. Good to see a gamer get a new pc. May this help spencer in his loss. Sad to know about the loss to people's homes and losses there.
180 miles is not "down the street"....
He looks like an average redditor!
Why do americans still build their houses out of cardboard? It's so easy: Concrete/cement/thick brick walls = fire/hurricane/tsunami proof. Sure, everything inside may burn or get destroyed, but you still have a house (and a roof) you can easily clean and fix.
Dear God you need more high speed trains in the US
05:12 OMG
Nature taking its land back from us
I've been subbed to LTT for like 10 years and you about 1,5 years now and unexpectedly I actually watched your video on this first. Good job man! Great to see the #PCMR like this.
LTTStore.com
So good!
was sent here by LTT. subscribing
Lol that llt plug tho
you can tell thin man uses Reddit
Gotta love the LTT store plug But damn dude, that’s amazing, I think the tech YT community is one of the best on the whole site  180 miles to deliver a PC to a random guy from internet that a massive youtuber sent as a gift, PogChamp
Kudos to linus for doing this.
This was really cool and great for the soul. Great job to you and Linus, truly.
Woow thats crazy!  I am in Salem 2
I smiled.
driving through that neighborhood made it more real than i expected you just earned that subscription i wish i was rich enough to join
When you were going 'up the road' and 2 hours in, I waa thinking, if I was you I'd be thinking, "Why am I doing this!!!!"  Then I saw the scorched earth of peoples homes and thought that's why.   Well done all involved and best wishes from Ireland.
This was an amazing collaboration between you and LTT. I live in the bay and have tons of friends who have lost some or all of their stuff, including some of my own gear in a close friends house fire in the santa cruz mountains this summer. I'm working hard to start my own tech channel which he was supposed to be helping to produce music for, but while he has his rig still he hasn't had any time to work on it since things went belly up. Glad to see this ended how everyone in the community wanted it too. If I get some time I'm gonna have to do a video like this of my friend's new studio once we've had a chance to actually set him something proper up, just means traveling 3 hours one way to film now because he had to move out of the area, after just getting the perfect place a month earlier :(
"you think it'll run TF2?" asking the real questions. What a chad.
Honestly it’s amazing to see the community coming together in times like these. I’m going to sub to this channel thanks to Linus. So happy to see a fellow gamer happy again
GEEZUS...LTT store plug here too!!  Damn it Linus. lol
nice. good luck running tf2
Looks like local McDonald also survive the fires ;-)
I'm from Corvallis... I live in kennewick washington but I'm from Corvallis
good job mates!!!
Came here from linus's video.. bruhh you need some better BGM 😌😌😌 seriously..  everything else is just fine.. but that BGM omg..  But still  Great work yoo 🤘🤘🤘🤘🔥❤️
Best Community is the PC Community !! my respect !!
It so cool that you guys were able to do this for him.
That's a great story you guys rock .... Man it was really shocking when he pulled into his neighborhood so sad
From someone whose hometown was devastated by those fires, thank you from all of Southern Oregon! Little bits of hope like this is what this community here needs!
The fires on the west coast are absolutely tragic, but on the upside, there's no more trash on the streets
Things like this restore my faith in humanity. Just incredible.
What an awesome n nice guesture. 👍🏻
Earned a sub from me
You deserve more subs I'm subscribing just because of the sheer generosity
No, you're breath taking.
mentions 185 miles like its a long distance... their are provinces and states that arent that wide lol have you ever driven through ontario? lol
adorable
Such a kind gesture! Does remind anyone of the Austin Evans situation when he lost everything? All the YouTubers coming together to help
I really hope Linus sent some gas money for that shameless LTT store plug 😂😂😂
I subscribe to both Craft Computing and Linus Tech Tips and just watched both videos. I have always thought you are both very decent caring guys. This goes to prove it. Wonderful video laughed  with the LTT store.com in the Craft video, but was shocked on the scale of destruction. Truly hart warming to see Spencer revive his new pc. Thank you.
Thank you guys for this.
wholesome
As soon as you dropped that “LTT store.com” bit I went ahead and just SMASHED that like button.
I teared up this is amazing
I've done this kind of drive. 2.5-3 hours to visit family
*slow claps*
this is a wonderful moment in PCMR😭
Great job gentlemen. Heart warming to know humans still want to do kind things for other humans.
5:11 aint linus supposed to do that?
Great job guys!
Not all heroes wear capes.. But some wear branded merch.
This whole thing was really awesome of you and ltt. I’m sure this will make a tragic moment in his life a little easier.
yup that's a reddit user alright, jokes aside tho this was very nice of ya'll ^^
Yo! I am a custom Gaming PC builder from Salem Oregon also! I was working on starting my own Youtube channel based around PCs. Just discovered you through the Linus video. Wish I had known of you sooner. We should meet up. Would love to interact with other builders in the area.
8:47 I saw him open the watter bottle and thought, you have to say it. Then he goes "Lttstore-dot-com" Yay!! T.T Linus would be so proud....
Isn't it amazing how these fires can somehow leave one house untouched while all the other houses burn to a crisp. See that all the time here in Australia after such events.
kudos to your generosity and willingness to help. this world needs more people like you!
LTT Gang is here
55 People accidentally clicked the wrong thumb button, but 13,000 clicked the correct thumb button. So that's good.
I'll mention for Linus that some of us Canadians measure distance in time and also have terms for the time. Just up the road is around a 4 hour drive.
Anyone else waiting for Linus to comment...     LTTstore.com
Well done, boys
Spencer seems like a chill guy and a new pc after such a devastating event must be uplifting. Hope he has a good time.
damn  i realy need to update my pc sometime
A heart warming story!
It's awesome that you all were able and chose to help this guy out. Fires are crazy. The fires have started all over California and into Oregon. It's like hell on earth. I live in Oroville, CA and the smoke was once so bad it looked bright orange everywhere with the sunlight and smoke and ashes raining down. It was like that for the week.
This is so good, Spencer has good luck to have people like this.
Y'all are the shit. Both channels. You know this helped this guy through one of the toughest things he's ever gone through probably.
Great gesture, amazing story. But men, (And please people don't be dumb people by getting me wrong)  that men need another kind of help besides the PC, his breath hitched from just picking up the PC... Leaving that aside, I really hope he can recover all he lost, I can only imagine what is like to loose everything.
I was wondering why Linus's half didn't have the lttstore.com plug.
You earned my view and like fair and square sir.
This is so wholesome I love the PC community
Spencer: 8:53 Linus: "You got the job!"
Happy you got to work together on this!
but what IPA are you drinking while driving?
The 60 people who disliked this you need to get a life. You low down pieces of $#!&
Even people from Oregon chooses AMD over Intel.
Awesome video that I just subbed ... Also I'm a local here in Salem OR like you =)
Well done, fellow human.
Nice !
Thank you US Customs for opening a brand new monitor thinking it was suspicious
Jealousy always gets the best of me  when I see these videos 😭
This was good of you and good of LTT. I'm happy that you'll get some bonus traffic from LTT, you deserve it.
Such a cool feel good story
fair play
a gamer has lost his PC, taht is just anacceptable "Normal" people wont get it pfff
Jeff thumbs up
LTT Store. Com man.
Nice
Linus:- He just lives a street up  He:- Plans a trip to the monn
You guys are awesome for doing this.
Linus: Sourcing and System Integration. Spencer: QC, Logistics, and on site support
Glade to see you get some traffic from LTT. Been around on your channel for 2 years and hope you get some sub growth.
This is community.
That casual ltt store thrown in there
This was absolutely wholesome. I almost cried.  Faith in humanity restored.
like your mask, where can I get one like it?
The funny part is I live close to 50 miles away from the fires
What a man! You earned a new subscriber.
In my country there are no roads that could give me a "go straight for 3 hours" lol
Props to you and LTT...  you guys are amazing!!
Awesome job!!
This made me pretty emotional
Ummm, yeah, ahhh, my rig, uh, burned up in a fire too. Can I get a new ltt computer? (Nevermind the gas and matches)  Jk, good job guys. And I hope homie gets back on his feet soon. All around good feel good vids.
sub. !!
This was a really stand-up move, man.  Your casual generosity is an inspiration.  Thanks for setting such a great example in these awful times.
I missed my LTTstore.com plug from last video. Fortunately I got it twice in this video
Jeff, I've been watching you since the beginning (beer and computers, yes please!) and to find out you're from my hometown makes it even better. I've lost all my possessions in a house fire years ago, including my first PC... so this hits home, happy to know there are still people willing to go above and beyond to help others in need.  P.S. Waiting for you to do some sort of meet up, with beers of course.
Such a good job guys.   There some goodness in the world.   Enjoy the PC from the guys in Canada.
The devastation oh the burnt down streets is awful! In Australia, bush and forest fires are a regular occurrence but it never gets easier to watch the aftermath.
Such a nice video. It was nice and you could see that poor guy was incredible happy and grateful. All the best from Spain, a country where if were to drive 180 miles you would be, pretty much, on the other side of the country 😆🇪🇸
Someone get this man a 3080! Oh and me too!
tbh this dude looks like ur average reddit user
I hope the box is full of beer!
When Spencer was looking over his new build, have to admit got some moisture in my eyes. Hmrpph but men don’t do that. Hhmmm. Enjoy Spencer.
Nissan Frontier 6 speed?
I came from the LTT video. It's sweet that this community is looking out for each other like this. Respect.
Awesome work.
Feels good to be PCMR. Craft Computing feels like a throwback to the 80's and 90's computer shows. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_o8gerare0
Seen the build on LTT came here and subed before even watching the video. You and Linus are amazing for doing this for him. Bless you both. You guys still give me hope for humanity.
Great thing you've done! (comment mostly for engagement)
LOVE THE PLUG XD 5:13
Damn, what a nice guy. If I could double sub I would.
Even here there is no escaping the lttstore
Got me with the LTT store plug. I knew it was coming as soon as i saw you lift the bottle haha.  This is great though, driving all that way and Linus putting the rig together. New sub :)
In 2 weeks he got 1.9K views on a video, this vid, 2 hours 77K
Driving 180 miles just to deliver a computer and make one gamer happy my friend take my like and my sub 🙂👍
Hahah I want a txt 2080 super too
House burns down “I feel so lucky”
Nice work!! This should get some exposure!!!
Ok! First Time I’ve watched a Craft Computing Video. - I usually watch Linus, but on his recommendation I came and finished the story. Great job overall.  I do have a few slight critiques. - 1. Blatant crude humour “that’s what she said”, while funny - made me hard cringe - Linus has crude humour, but it’s very subtle - not in your face and never the direct focus of the video - especially not with a new person you just met, who may want to show this video to family friends, grandparents etc. - hard cringe dude. - 2. Comments on masking at the end. Yes - we absolutely should be wearing a mask during this pandemic. If it help or not, if it’s a personal choice or not. - it’s really irrelevant. Regardless of if one like it or not, masking has become a political issue. This is a tech Video. - there is enough videos and news blasted at us everyday on political issues. The one thing I have highly admired Linus for, is his unwillingness to deliberately politicize his content. Watching tech videos, is somewhat a refuge from content that’s constantly about politics. Veering too far into these waters is going to alienate potential subscribers. As you will be making it highly obvious on which side of issues you support. Please don’t politicize overtly content on tech videos, that’s completely off topic of actual tech.  Those two slight criticisms being said, I enjoyed your video, the story, and you guys did an awesome job, love the collaboration. You earned a subscriber here.
Just wanted to say, besides this being an awesome  thing to do. I loved the LTTStore.com promo! LOL
Oh shit I’ve got a new bmpcc 6K and I live 12 miles away. I would have gladly dropped the PC off 😂
Haha nice LTT Store shout-out! Awesome video man, good stuff to see out of tragedy.
“Everyone liked that”
You have just gained a new native Oregonian subscriber!
I have the exact same monitor. It's great and I think he'll love it.
TF2 pog
This video makes me feel so genuinely happy.
That was super cool and enjoy that awesome rig dude.
Oh no, the LTT store shout out is spreading!
One lucky reddit user. I cant imagine what it would be like to lose your home because of a wild fire.
That was a scary couple weeks. Many friends had to evacuate, many were at level 2 and we were preparing for if we had to. You guys did a great thing!
you and Linus are fantastic ...great job  making an otherwise miserable year a little better!  Subscribed.
45 twats at time of posting.  great gesture from you and LTT
PCMR is not just about the machine. Equal love and respect for both the metal and blood!
thats awesome
For someone who lost allot in the fire - It's really nice LTT and Craft Computing did this.
Ok, the LTT Store plug earned you a sub from me - lol
Congrats Spencer I saw this on Reddit and I'm so glad some members of the community stepped up to get you gaming again! I couldn't stop smiling the entire reveal video and the personal lttstore plug was great lol. Happy gaming!
When u said "LTTstore.com" I was smiling :') That gave you a sub! <3
The LTTStore plug I'm dying!!!
The PC Gaming Gods has bless thee
Compared to florida's %50 mask rate.
Wow my heart dropped when he pulled into the neighborhood that was victim to the fires. So sad
Very good and humbling video I think Spencer will never forget this moment and also Linus will be very proud you shout out lttstore.com LOL,
Gamers: We might be dicks to each other, we might go overboard with trolling or doing stupid things but we always look out for each other! We're the metal heads of the gaming industry haha  This was such a good thing to do. I mean can't help everyone but just trying alone is enough! Glad this got a happy ending :D
Nice to see some genuine humanity 👍😀
Strong work out of you and Linus!  Thanks  for doing something nice to help make another human's harsh 2020 experience less hateful.
Booger
Jesus Christ, those houses, there's nothing there! I'm angry & heartbroken. I wish for everyone there an amazing recovery and I hope they can regain their lives back from this awful tragedy. What a great ending to this video though with that awesome PC build. And @Craft Computing drove over 6 hours to deliver it! Dang son! You a nice person. I love PC stuff, so you def getting a sub from me. +LIKE +SHARE +NEW SUBSCRIBER <--Make sure and hit that bell! 🔔  Keep it up!
Good on you! This is so cool and heartwarming. I needed this today. :-)
Subbed for the 3 hour drive
Came here from LTT just wondering where did you get that face mask looks pretty cool and the way it wraps around your ear I have one kind of like that but always falls down because it doesn't wrap around the ear
8:53 he's a real one
Yo this is crazy, I live in his area, my house if fine but it burnt just down the street.
lol i just got that monitor he got. amazing monitor. u guys are super awesome
Spencer does look like a redditor heh , glad he got a cool replacement pc tho!
This man drove 6 hours just to deliver a pc.
"Continue straight for three hours..." - a thing  you will literally never hear a sat nav in the UK say (well, unless you go round the M25 twice or something). That's...slightly mind boggling.  Also, very cool project :)
Are you related to Cody from CodysLab?
when he was jealous of the 2080 super it made me feel bad for having a 3080.... sorry bud I'll sell it to you.
TF2Bois
When he says that the length of my whole country is up the road
is that really smart to use the old mounting bracket i got a feeling something will flake off and be a risk to the pc
Ummm no offense but 180 miles is NOT nor will it ever be just up the road lol. Thats a tank of gas round trip there.
great thanks alot stupid parents doing there gender reveal  least u guys got him the pc <3
its just a bigger andy milonakis
"True gamer". ~Spencer
Absolutely excellent work to a deserving genuine dude. Subscribed!
The water bottle part really killed me. Now I have to take a sip from my LTT bottle as well 🤣
that was so kind, I hope everyone recovers from this incident
Why can I only give 1 Thumbs up for this?
I love democracy...
ma name jeff
Very sobering seeing all those flattened, burned down houses. God Bless Oregon. :'(
I just finished watching LTT video and magical YouTube recommended this for me.   Youtube Algorithms: 😎
Yeah up the road..3 hours up the road..
Oh look the YouTube algorithm is working lol this was great!
Just down the road...🤣
Best tech YouTube collab ever, you guys are all good people.
Sent by Linus, thanks for being a good human being.
Linus released Video first
No one really gonna say it
Great Job Linus and Jeff... 185 miles away! Jeesh and here I thought my state was big... NOPE! LOL I live in New Hampshire... Compared to Oregon we are like Connecticut in size.
5:27 holy shit, look at the devastation, that's a very sad sight
God Speed Andy Milonakis, get a job.
Its awesome what you and LTT are doing. I live in Bend and its sad to see so much was destroyed. My heart goes out to the families effected by these fires.
its reassuring to know good people around hear 👍
really nice move, all the best for the future my man!
08:52 lol you the man
Great work!  Talent, OR was hit HARD by the fires.  My aunts old place didn't make it and my father-in-law's was about 2 miles from the fire.
Even outside his own channel Linus manages to stick in an LTTstore plug somewhere
It looks like a war zone there...
I'm not crying, you're crying.
Nicely done sir. Respect.
That is so sad to see , all those houses burned down 😭
Glorious wholesome people masterrace
Man Spencer is son of Anthony....
Really awesome to see techtubers band together to help an unfortunate PCMR fella!
I was thinking "if he lives so close to that guy and he's completely fine apparently, how is it that the guy from reddit lost everything?" and now it makes a lot more sense lol
Nice of you but that shirt you gave him was about 8 sizes to small
Love seeing these type of collaborations. Such a great video!
So my Wife's Boyfriend(we're poly) is a developer who also brews his own beer. Your shirt would be the perfect gift for him! You should sell merch!
came from the worst trade video subing
8:52 Did he say ltt.store.com
lttstore.com
I was wondering where Spencer lived and followed the link here to watch the Craft Computing video too.  I'm luck, I only had to deal with the smoke here in Eugene.  I shocking thinking about all the damage.  I recognise some of the area in the Craft Computing drive especially the mountains as he was approaching Hugo.  I've done lots of driving and had the good fortune to get to go to a place along Hwy 126 that was minimally touched by the fire but has changed, the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest (https://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/), a very nice place.  If I get to go up there again this spring that is going to be a very different drive now.  I'm sorry to hear about the destruction and loss of life but I'm also glad it was not worse and currently the Holiday Farm fire is at 96% containment.  A very big Thank You to the Firefighters and other Responders and Organizations that are helping everyone.  I do agree with others that the brackets should have been clear coated to prevent further deterioration and/or contamination of the new PC.  A great offer to make him a new PC though.
Turning a bad situation into something positive. You (and Linus) rock! Also, dang you got to collab with Linus! Nice!
Hey!!! I use to live in Salem too! Man, this got you a subscribe!!! How cool of you and Linus for doing this and can't wait to see where YOUR channel goes!
<3
Nice to see some good in the world in 2020.
It's crazy how there's just a few random houses completely surrounded by destroyed buildings, like houses destroyed on both sides of a house, but that house is fine.
Linus sent me to say hi
I love the LTT store plug
Good on ya bud. Subbed.
spencer definitly looks like a redditor
really good of you both, ltt and yourself, couldn't believe the wasteland that were peoples homes!  devastating fires, seen reports of US fires here in the UK  but when you see the aftermath it sort of brings it home, well done good karma  to you all.
Salem represent!  Well done! Nice way to inject a little joy in an otherwise devastating situation.
This whole thing was amazing! Thank you for doing this!  Also TF2? Spencer has good taste
Wholesome vibes ♥️😔
You and Linus are fucking legends
I find it awesome that Linus rebuilt a slightly better PC for the man. If I had a PC anywhere near that good and it was lost in a fire, I would be upset that all that money was just burnt away in a fire you couldn't prevent. Of course not accounting for a lot of property damage to be dwelling over.
Spencer is a unit
Take this sub and like, you're a good man, thank you for making him happy.
@Craft Computing -- could I get a link to the mask you are wearing par chance?
Linus has quite the unique definition for "just up the road."
The absolute devastation is horrible. I have tears in my eyes just seeing all the burnt out buildings. Such a pity.
just amazing PCMR community.  Much love for LTT and Craft Computing you guys are awesome
It's so great that you and Linus were able to do something nice for someone to whom not a lot of nice things have happened lately.
Damn. You have some loooooong roads there in Oregon.
I love how Linus said in his video that you basically live next street
You win the day. As well as a new subscriber
Ah another fan of Rain-X I see
Enjoyed my time here :)
I was sent by mr. L  This ain't much but here is an honest subcribe for you. Thank you. More power!!!
very nice .....
nice gesture
Best part of this video.... lttstore.com!!!
This warmed my heart, y'all are too kind!
I'm here after Watching Linus building it. 🔥🔥 Huge Respect to you and linus for caring So much... ther are still Good people around the World . Yall proved it 🔥👍
baddass.
Sent by linus and had to give a sub
5:11 😂😂😂
5:26 uh...
he started touching the TG to point out the components in the pc, then puts the pc on the left side of the desk hiding the TG and components, fucking reddit
This guy has excellent taste in games
This is going to get lost in the comments but I used to live in Oregon a couple of years back and this hurts to see what is happening and when I lived there it was a quiet place always raining cold and now it’s just burnt and loud with the riots it’s sad 😔
I came here after watching the LTT video, you have my like and subscribe! This was awesome!
omg that LTTstore plug.... That was amazing.
Another win for the internet today!
Good on you and LInus doing this. This year sucks enough, trying to make it just a little better for some of us is just great.
Haha he plugged lttstore.com
You cant escape the lttstore it is coming for you. Hide yo kids, hide yo wifes!
Much love from Corvallis, this is great!
Love it.  Great teamwork everyone!
he looks like a mini anthony from LTT
Nice to see you in my neck of the woods.  I live about 30 mins north of Talent/Phoenix.  The devastation is just insane and for it to happen so close to home....crazy to put it lightly.  You guys are absolutely amazing for taking the time to do this for someone.
you can't escape LTTstore.com huh?
First project with LTT! Keep up the great work! Love seeing collaboration in the community!
Jeff, you guys are killer for doing that for this guy. Cheers man. More confirmation why I'm subbed
Good work
Like if you where sent here from linus
Nice job. Pretty cool of you and LTT to help that young man out.
<3 Spencer
Continue straight for THREE HOURS
This guy is a f**king legend drove 180 miles to deliver a computer puts literal LTT ads in his video and also before LTT did offers a PC
Link to discord?
man, that neighborhood looks like the beginning area of Fallout 4...
I'll subscribed and watch your videos because of what you did and because linus said so 😁
A shout out for LTT store - you sire are a legand.
Ahh the ltt store shoutout :)
LTTStore.com!!
Deserve another sub mate....here you go
Bro njoi the rig!!
lol hi
05:26 Sombre moment..  On another lighter note, LTTstore.com plug was amusing.
Linus: he lives up the road from Craft Computing Craft Computing: about 185 miles
5:25 crawl out through the fallout
Sent by linus, first time hearing of your channel.
New sub for you man really glad Linus teamed up with you.
why didnt we meet  the other  hero grany. Come  on guys. the other hero..???
ok
So you never got a 2080 super.... Dam I some how score one hell of a deal on eBay for one like 5 months ago. I should mention I live in s  fl
Sent by linus
man. you are nice person
Come from linus tech tips
Better lttstore.com ad placement than linus.
My good sir is the vehicle that you are driving a *manual*
5:12 I WAS WONDERING WHERE THAT PLUG WAS! 😂
5:09 - what just happened?
spencer looks like what i'd expect redditor to look like
Dude, my  family is in talent. This is awesome to see someone in the community getting something back.
So wholesome, glad something good can come out of this terrible situation. Stay safe
He seems like a nice guy
Yeah very nice thing to do for Spencer. Found it strange that I didn’t hear a “thank you” at all in the video tho.  Maybe it just didn’t make the final cut
Am I the only one that gets young Gabe Newell vibes from him
Me: But if you’re just up the road wouldn’t you be affected.  You: Which means I’m still about 100+ miles away.  Me: ...oh
Please America, learn from these events (not so much this wonderful cooperation between this channel and LTT, but rather the fires). If we don't deem wood to be a suitable building material for homes in the Netherlands, where we only have tiny forest fires, no hurricanes, no twisters, no flooding (well, not anymore we don't), and just no extreme weather events, you shouldn't deem wood a suitable building material over there. It's always the same in the "after" shots: anything brick is standing, anything wooden is just gone. The lower cost that comes from using wood instead of brick or concrete is just nothing compared to what you stand to lose in the more and more likely event of extreme weather. Let's hope the fires die down quickly.
I know that feeling very well of going into cities destroyed by nature. It is definitely breathtaking and a tough one mentally. I did this returning to Bay County, Florida after Hurricane Michael (2018) and losing my apartment from it. This was a very nice gesture to help smooth over a replacement they may not have been able to afford for quite some time depending on finances, insurance, etc. Good job, everyone involved. ♥️👍🏼
This is my first video I've seen of you and I could tell right away you were from Oregon. 🤣🤣 I'm treating this as a compliment though.
Great collab saving a gamer in despair!
Total respect to ya, 3 hours 13 minutes!
Nice. The Video i Watched before was the one at Linus
Subscribed! Thanks for being a legend and helping someone who has had a rough year.
PCMR FTW, i feel sorry spencer he lost his home, I hope i could help. Love from Pakistan.
Linus sent me and I love this
Oh that's just down the road..... 300+ miles later....
I didn't expect you to work with LTT. So glad y'all helped Spencer
i CANNOT get away from the lttstore.com adds lol
This was awesome.
this is honestly one of the most wholesome things lead by reddit
That LTTstore plug tho 🤣🤣
Oh God... LTT store everywhere... Got to grab some merch now👍🏻....
Your the best. Isn’t even close to saying what this means to the family you helped. Keep the work up and soon u will be like ltt.
lol the LTT store plug
Love'd the LTT store spot. Great work, sub'd because I'm a rare beer drinker and pc enthusiast.
Awesome collab. Awesome LTT plug. Oh and check into a backup audio recorder.
Fuken Eh.
Just saw Linus video and then watched this. I'm so glad you guys went so far above and beyond to help someone in need. That drive was no joke! This was really special.
Feels so good watching this after having seen the post on reddit
I love how there is no drama in the tech community only love! Best community on the internet!
Good on you guys.  2 thumbs up.
It’s my first time at your channel but I digg your intro
This warms my heart to see how the pc community comes together like this. The pc looks great and probably performs great. Im glad hes happy with his build. Unfortunately ill be parting my beautiful pc out soon when i go to leave for the marines where ever they ship me off.
He does look like a Redditor lmfao
Definitely worth a sub
The fricken lttstore.com plug got me! 😂
I see you both made decision on the color for your water bottles
Good karma all around here!  Well done guys!
So wholesome
Those LTT Store scenes left me laughing hard ... ;)
Hell yeah!!!!
I’m happy that he’s happy 😊 made my day
Linus: “fortunately he live right up the road from him” Me: sweet dude is really lucky! Navigation: *CONTINUE ON ROAD FOR 3.5 HOURS*
Jeff, what mask are you using? That's almost exactly like the style I want.
That lttstore.com got me cracking 😂😂😂😂
take my sub you deserve it
I live in eastern Oregon, thank goodness! So sad so many have lost so much because of these fires. ☹😟
I had no idea this guy lived in the same city as me. WTF.
Not even watching a different channel will keep you safe from the lttstore.com plugs
fun fact..there is no (if im not completely blind) LTTStore.com plug in LTT video, but they hid easter egg here 👀😂
That was awesome. Some love during this time.
is Interstate 205 a bypass free way
He did it. He did the thing. lttstore.com
6:35 Mans house burnt down. “How’s it goin?”    6:47 mans struggles to take out pc “that’s what she said”. Cringe 😅
Great job man . You rock
Nicely done sir. It's truly astonishing how devastating the fires and hurricanes have been lately. It's nice to see people networking to care for one another. My girlfriend and I were talking about a small time Twitch game streamer she follows who went dark suddenly. She eventually found out through Twitter that the recent hurricanes in Louisiana destroyed his community and he ended up having to sell his PC and equipment to help pay for more pressing and immediate needs. A lot of people are hurting right now. Thanks for helping to alleviate some of the pain.
that first shot of the aftermath completely took me off-guard :(
this just proves how epic the gaming community is
It’s kinda weird seeing where I live on YouTube, I’ve literally been to that trailer park in Talent. Lucky guy, maybe I’ll run into him sometime.
glad that 3 things came out of this: 1) a great story in what can only be described as not great times, 2) some good karma being put out in the world, 3) a new channel to follow!
Damn dude Linus hit the jackpot with the merch. LTT store .com is so easy to say and remember everyone does it as a meme but it's free merch plugs
Spencer seems really sweet, this was a really nice thing you and Linus did for him
Nice! here from Linustechtips! You just earned a subscriber!
It's so sad to see all that destruction.. at least some light among the darkness you guys are amazing!
The bottle "ad" made me chuckle, you made linus proud
When you were raided by linus
So cool you have hooked up with LTT. Your channel is really great, I enjoy it a lot. My favorite "underdog" youtuber at the moment, Oz talks hardware in 2.
when i got my pc  i asked the same thing  8:17
That LTT store plug was priceless
TF2! True Gamer
I hope you get some subs from that collab!
Congrats Spencer, Man that’s heartbreaking seeing that community completely gone. Wow just so sad so sad.
@tanmay bhat  6:36  yaha pe kya kar rahe ho bhai dhoke se PC lene aai ho
I'm very glad to see this and happy for Spencer so here's a message for you budd , there's nothing with overweight , that's true and i respect everything, but i Encourage you to go on a healthy diet that a doctor reccomends , you can do few exercices from time to time, by the time you're an adult you will find no trouble breathing , back/neck pain etc .. Wish you the best and i wish everyone is safe , would have done the same thing Craft Computing did , Take care !
Using the original burnt mounting brackets is epic!  What a story behind that build, that’s going to be a system that dude will treasure.
lttstore.com, that’ll haunt me forever
Great stuff!!!
He even did the "LTTstore.com" love it.😂
Love stuff like this. I'm so happy for this dude. At least he has something and can feel a little better.
It's so cool seeing all these familiar clips as an Oregonite myself
I’m glad I found this channel, this is so pure and heartwarming, helping out a fellow PC enthusiast. I’m sure he had a huge smile under that mask. I think the best part about this that I now follow a awesome YouTuber that lives close by too 😂❤️
Anyone else's heart skip a beat? Seeing him staring at the camera instead of that truck about to merge on the left @9:20
Good on you mate.  It's been nice to see support pouring in from all over for our little community. One PC isn't going to fix everything but a lot of people doing what they can to help has made a big difference and this is just one piece of that.  Thanks for chipping in.
WHOLESOME!
"Continue straight for 3 hours and 13 minutes" - GPS
Amazing
Nice ltt store segment 👍
185 miles "relatively close". The UK at its widest is 300 miles 😂😂.  Came here from LTT, subscribed
It seems very.. On brand for LTT to ship in an upside down "This side up" box..
LTTSTORE.COM
ensurance companies won't like any of that
damn Spencer thiccccccc
NICE to LTT and Craft. I hadnt seen any of your videos before today but look forward to watch them from now on......

Here from ltt
You and Linus doing God's work.
Dear god!!! A 3 hour drive? I have family who lives an hour away and I loathe the idea of visiting them.
As an owner of a 2019 Nissan Frontier who just took a 500 mile round trip 2 days ago, I can confirm that butt gets sore after a while.
What a hellscape! Must suck to lose all your shit like that...
Very XLNT for you to do this.  "Just down the road."   3 1/2 hours?  WTH are you talking about?  Great Job helping make a bad situation better.  Cheers from 🟥🍁🟥
Man I love living in Ohio where Kings Island is just down the road from Cedar Point.
Such a nice thing of all you guys to do to set Spencer up with a new computer! Just found this channel after watching LTT:s video. Subbed and hit the notification button immediately after watching this. I'm gonna go watch some more Craft Computing videos now.
Awesome!!!   Subscribed because of this!!1
This was so heart warming good job guys keep it up
"You think this could play TF2?" WHAT A KING!
You’re in the big leagues now Jeff that’s what this means.
I love the little wall I lookin thing on his dash
The old mounting bracket was a nice touch 👌
now thats a unit
It's awesome when tech-tubers team up to make people's day a little better
Doesn't matter where I go, I always end up getting LTTstore.com advertised to me haha! Great video man
Not all heroes wear capes
Jeff you are an absolute legend
LTTSTORE DOT COM
also drive safe  dont drive when filming by ur self
Great to see you all working together to help a user out, great video!! 👍😎
Good to provide some good to those that are going through hard times.
LOL   LOL   i wasn't going to subscribe  but for the superb segway ... there you go
HA! I am not the only one that buckles in my computer when I transport it.
lttstore.com
Those pictures of the aftermath rammed it home for me here in Europe what happened over there. We hear about the california fires of course, not so much about other states.   And of course, really awesome collab there, really like it.
I love the LTTstore.com shout out. My buddy at work got one and I asked where he got it. His face lit up and he held it up and said "LTTStore.com" and we both laughed. Its a meme at this point not an ad.
8:53
Keep up the good work.
LTTStore.com
This was such a fantastic gesture from the both of you! Not seen your channel before so i think imma sub and put them notifications on :)
average redditor
Thank you  Craft Computing  😍
Any one from Linus ?????
3 hours is relatively close? You would crossed my country in 3 hours 🤣
It's great that you reached out to build one, even though you don't have the resources that the bigger channels have. Hopefully this partnering with LTT for this delivery of a build will help boost your channel way up, you deserve it
Someone that literally just lost everything hearing him say I'm so lucky warms anyone heart!
You are a good man!
Simply amazing! Hard to watch without tearing up. Bravo
This is awesome. So glad that Spencer was able to get a little bit of happiness from such a horrible event.
Up the road in Oregon: 185 miles Up the road in Guam: Literally 2 minutes or less than an 1/8 of a mile
this is nice !!
watching a youtube video and seeing places i go to all the time is kinda weird
#lttstore.com!  Thanks for your awesome gift to him guys!
LOVE the LTT store plug!  ...lttstore.com
It's amazing that "LTT Store dot com" is a point of laughter and complete acceptance by the community. 😄 lol
That was harsh to watch you pull into the park! So much devastation!
This was awesome. You and LTT are great for doing this!
Subbed for doing such a great thing in such a crappy situation, kudos for helping out a fellow gamer.
I live in Texas... 3hrs to Dallas...3hrs to Houston.... 6+ to San Antonio....
Fantastic, you guys made light from someones darkness !!
I really want "lttstore.com" to become a full on meme in the tech youtuber space. I want to see Paul or Jayz or steve start shilling for linus for the memes
AHHHH, can't get away from the LTT Store . com product placement!
TF2 omg, lol
That's the most PCMR-looking guy I've ever seen
This is wholesome
It's nice to see a person that loose very much and now get some slack.
Linus is fake, he reviews gaming laptops 2019 and 2020 and he says everything about the laptop but nothing about the 100c on cpu when gaming, he reviewed the alienware and razor laptops and never said nothing about it. I don't trust Linus
i cannot understand why ppl disslike videos like this like wtf
Them: A gamer lost his PC. Others: That's sad. Me: I....
This brought a tear to my eye seeing how helpful people can be
This video is gonna break all the records on your channel. Congratulation!!  🤣🤣
As a multidisciplinary engineer, I have some concern using the brackets that survived the fire as detempering could have occurred which would impact the structural integrity of the bracket. Just mentioning this since the bracket is designed to support the weight of the cooler.
You guys out west be safe and gl! ✌️🥰
*Wholesome:100*
You and Linus rock for doing this for this young man!!
Great video.  Been subbed to your channel for about a year now.  Great to see you do a collab with Linus.  Keep up the excellent work!
The devastation is just unbelievable, the amount of people effected is heartbreaking.  Awesome job helping!
wHo CaMe HeRe FrOm LiNuS’ vIdEo?
well done!
lltstore.com
He seems like a nice kid, im glad you guys could help him.
This was incredibly wholesome of you, esp the 6-hour round-trip drive. Have a sub and a like.
Wait, you mean to tell me the internet can be used for good things too? Boy 2020 sure is something.
this makes me super happy to be an oregonian tech nerd :) im moving from gresham/ troutdale to salem area next week. I hope i randomly run into you jeff!!
Everyone liked that.   The ones who disliked aren't humans
HAhahahahaaaa LTTSTORE.com
Bring back memories of my fire last year. Servers, Hero Jr and all my other equipment burnt to a crisp. Fires suck!!!
Wow o just saw linus’s vid now i  am here YAY U GUYS ARE AWESOME
Im glad you guys were able to help him out. good job
My favorite YouTuber collaborating with the YouTuber that got me into PC building 11 years ago! Amazing!!
Linus: "He lives up the road from him." Jeff:    "Since I have a 3 hour home drive [...]"  *Not taking any chaces, aye Jeff?*
Damn you only live 20 minutes from where I am in oregon
Wow, spencer really did stick out his neck for his dead computer and received a new build with an upgrade even. Great job internet.
Watched Linus build it, then came here to see the delivery. Cudos to Linus and you for doing this !  Nice guy Spencer. Needs to work on himself, he is very young and it will be very beneficial for his future self. Best of luck !
... nose.
I knew craft computing sounded familiar
got your priorities strait,  pc buckled in.
Faith in humanity restored! Thank you LTT & Craft Computing for your contribution to the tech community!
i was summoned by linus
5:12 literally made my day
Man it's weird for me to see that many houses burnt down, because houses in my country  are there even after WW2. My house was on fire and nothing happened to it.
The water bottle add here also
This got me a little teary eyed,i am not gotta lie
i was in the oregon wildfires i understand Brother
I'll never be able to escape LTTStore plug, wouldn't I?
Us customs security are so thoughtful
Nice LTT Store shout out Jeff and I didn't come here from the link. Hopefully this collab will drive your numbers even higher. Good job on the drive.
Ooof the shipping for that must've been absolutely ridiculous 😂
Lttstore.com
This what a community  is about. Being there for one another.  Blessings
An amazing ending. This is awesome, guys. Spencer, hope you enjoy!
This man delivered a computer in a 300 mi roundtrip, hit that subscribe button...It's the least we could do.  PCMR4LIFE
Huzzahh! I discovered your channel for the first time last week and you are already working with LTT. I feel so Hipster right now.
😎
im in south salem my guy!
Man, that delivery company is quick.
I live just north of Roseburg and frequently travel down to Grants Pass/Medford. It was a scary couple of days, watching social media, seeing new fires pop up all around us.
That ltt plug at 5:12 😂😂 Linus would be proud
Omg you live in Oregon too! I recognize most of the roads you're on thats so trippy
Jeff - God bless you and America. 👍🍺
OK, I gotta know... HOW do you have the 30oz LTT water bottle in the car?? I tried that ONCE, and almost spilled coffee over EVERYTHING lol. Seriously, though, this was an awesome video and for once i am glad I watched an LTT video before yours lol.
Great community we have!
a striking reminder that we all need each other in this crazy time and pulling together like that, only in America! Shame you have Donald and we have Boris...
this is so wholesome...
5:25 😱
If your here from ltt give him a thumbs up and subscribe to his channel, amazing kindness from you both
This was a really great video, great thing that you guys did here!!
very happy for this dude
Saw this after watching the LTT build.  You and Linus are good dudes.  The look on Spencer's face (his eyes, anyway) was awesome.  Cheers, brother.
Awesome to see you help someone out
Going to get me a bottle one of these days
Good job reddit
@5:06 Oh god, Linus syndrome is spreading. Next thing you know you'll be dropping expensive components and wearing socks with sandals.
tf2 player what a champ
pog
Boomers say gaming is bad for you and it make you violent and u have stories like this im so proud to be a part of the gaming community ❤️
Linus send me ^^. subbed.
From Canada: I'm not bilingual, i dont speak °Miles° but kilometers sorry :(
8:50 “LTT Store” 🤣
Always great to see a feel good series of videos after a lot of strife in the news.
down the road - 3 hours
5:40 Yo that's literally Fallout 4 man
I don't know why I laughed so hard at the "lttstore.com"
Whats the mask you're wearing in the thumbnail? Or could you post it in the video description? Please please!
Video sponsored by LTTstore.com
The 9 dislikes (zap of me seeing this) are those who didn’t get a free PC
If you dislike the video you're not a decent human
I hope Spencer listed his old pc as, "computer in need of minor repair" on the customs form when shipping it to LTT.
I have a relative who lived there. He lost his home, too. My brother works for the school district there, and he said about 50% of the kids lost their homes.
The MrBeast of tech
Linus send me over
I love how much "LTTStore.com" has become a meme among the community xD
Great collab! Wow 2020 is the worst but it's always great to see some rays of light breaking through.
i live about 30 minutes from talents in grants pass oregon, thank yo so much for doing this!!! brings a tear to my eye,
HELL YEAH
This was awesome man!
Ltt and CC - good job!
So wholesome
It was super cool of you to deliver the PC. subbed.
I live in Oregon as well. Thankfully, I am in Central Oregon and was able to dodge all the fires. There was a lot of smoke for a couple of weeks but, I didn't even have to worry about evacuation or anything. This year sucks some major balls.
Gamers helping out gamers. This is awesome!
Omg looks like a nuke hit the subdivision....   Good job, helping a neighbour.  PS funny dropping a LTT.COM plug...
he is some big boi
no hate but man this guy takes the stereotypical redditor to a whole new level
wow, 6hrs driving would get me to Paris. That's not something I would drive for a one day trip.
Happy gaming Spence! :)
Am I the only one getting Fallout 4 vibes out of this?
You're amazing man! Thanks for doing this! <3 <3
Oh no I hope no one has been hurt. From the fire
Love that LLTstore shout out. Got a genuine laugh out of me!
LTTStoredotcom
lol my shit burned up in the same exact fire
Totally off topic, but where’d you get your face mask? I’ve been looking for something similar for a while and haven’t had any luck
Love seeing two channels coming together to do something good
Nice job guys! This channel is going to blow up from this.
Got to love the LTTSTORE.COM!
Im not tearing up! You're tearing up!
things like these make me proud of being part of the PC Master Race, you deserve my sub and a ton more mr. dude
That's amazing, congrats Spencer! I'm so sorry about the loss of your home
An amazing collab!
Super cool of you Linus and Craft C  to do this for Spencer! Lucky man to have friends like that !!  Great to see.
lol. "As always, I'm Jeff". Never, "Sometimes, I'm Jeff". How about "I'm Jeff".
Is that an Elecom HUGE trackball I see..?  Got me 2... one at home, one in the office.
I had to check out the other part of the story I came to this video from Ltt and from one oregon resident to another that was amazing on what you did for that man who has basically lost everything
was about to make a comment on you throwing shade on the build because of the lack of fan controller.. then I saw the water bottle gag.. well played sir.. well played.. really make me giggle!
LOOOVE the lttstore.com shoutout.
That LTT store.com plug had me laughing so hard
Bravo good sir! I'll subscribe to that
That's community spirit at it's best. IT community and community as whole.
what an absolutely bloody lovely vid............
<3
#justgamerthings
lttstore.com
I'm sorry for the lost of your home Spencer. Seeing you happy about your PC made me happy.
So this is what keep my hope alive for humanity in this world! You and Linus are what make PC community so great!
Fantastic, great work guys.
Seeing the devastation... Seeing the tech community rallying for one of our own. I won't lie, I cried a bit. My heart goes out to all those that have been impacted by the fires.
TF2...  THUG LIFE
Some say that bad luck is still luck.
you got a new sube from LTT
lttstore.com
Absolutely amazing, two tech youtubers provide "insurance" to a fellow gamer who lost their loved rig. Loved that little LTTSTORE.COM ad.
“Think it will run tf2?” Gamer
How fucking tall is Spencer, man?  I'm 6'4 myself, but either Jeff drives a Ford Ranger, or Spencer is taller than I am.
came here from the llt video, this is very heartwarming to see ^^ you got yourself a new sub :p It's quite funny to think about that "short" distance you traveled, if you would start at one side of my home country (Belgium) and you drove the same distance, you would have done the entire country xD
This was amazing! Subbed!
jeez that is insane...... glad i live in england....massive props to you and ltt for doing this awesome collab......... :D <3
Absolutely perfect segue to LTTStore.com there! Linus would be proud.
That LTT store.com bit though. 😂
This was an extremely emotional video for me.  When you drove in that park and showed the destruction just wow. How sad thanks for doing this for this poor guy.
Best video this year beats everything thanks for helping that man.
Pc master race ftw!
Subbed!!
LTT Store.com lmao
Lttstore.com
Subbed and belled.
Love it!! LTTstore.com
This just makes me smile a little.
Who dislikes these video ?
Dammit, I'm not even watching a Linus video and I'm still subjected to an LTTStore.com pitch.
The feels.  The devastation was just... wow... :(  Happy to see people come together and help him. Good job bud :)
This is so wholesome. So happy for him!!
That face expression “you have 3 hours ....” lmao
The ltt store plug killed me 🤣
Look to the left, everything is burned. Look to the right, everything is burned. But somehow, in the middle of that, a house is practically intact, without any sign of fire damage. Like... HOW.
PCMR Bros
Kudos to you and LTT :)
Thank you for making someone's unlucky day a lucky one!
Good wholesome content, bravo.  Got a new subscriber
Love from Canada Spencer.
Expert lttstore plugs, true professionals.  Also thats a really great mask, gotta find one designed like that
I said it the last time you had audio issues and I'll say it again: Dual audio sources.
Came from LTT
drinky
I love the tech community on youtube :)
Waiting to see that sub count boost :)
Hello ! I didn't know there were such horrible wildfires in Oregon. I'm so sorry for these locals. I couldn't contain my tears seeing this, for nature for the peoples who live there, and the famillies of the dead too. wenever, i hope he'll have fun with his new computer. thank for him to Craft Computing and  LTT !!
You’ve earned my subscription and bell notifications
Hell yeah dude, in the military we constantly help each other in ways that we are able. It was awesome to see you knock this out with the LTT crew and help a fellow gamer get back to what he loves.
What a bunch of GREAT MEN, WE PCMR ARE PROUD OF THE 2 OF YOU GUYS FOR HELPING OUR POOR BROTHER THAT JUST RECENTLY LOST HIS PC TO OREGON FIRE, MAY THE GOD BE WITH YOU
8:53 Love how he reps LTTstore.com like it's hes job!
Lttstore.com
OK who fucking disliked this is so wholesome
Could tell Spencer was way happier inside than he let on, I’m the same way It’s so awkward lol
This is great to see !:) I subscribed
Coming from linus’ video and I have to say you sound a bit like gun Jesus aka Forgotten Weapons.
Kudos to both of you guys for reaching out to a pcmr brother ! Stay safe
shameless LTT store plug
wholesome
Great collaboration!
Lttstore.com
NOOO! The LTTstore.com adds are inescapable!
Very moving, great work! Love the LTTStore.com plug as well.
reddit user
THAT LTTSTORE.COM AD. NOICE.
Linus sent me here 😊
Heartbreaking seeing that fire damage. Glad you got with LTT to help the guy out.
You guys are awesome for doing this.
Ok i thought i was safe from LTTstore.com here, but nope
Reddit.
This rocked!!! Fantastic work, seriously.
GoodGuyJeff
I know we all came here from linus , but this guy deserves a sub and a like as well , epic gamer moment gg.
So why they build homes of wood if they new ……what has happened in the past ………
lmao, the ltt bottle. Did they ship you one with the PC?
Wow glad you were able to record the neighborhood as you drove in, it really puts news headlines into perspective. Awesome work 👍
Really heartwarming. Well done.
How was the PC shipped? UPS, Fedex, ?... I thought it would be outright hazardous to ask these guys to ship a PC without having it annihilated.
Good deeds, you know the thing. Subscribed
such a wholesome guy. Makes me happy to see something like this
"You think it'll run tf2?" Good man
Who is here after watching linus's video!👍
Thanks to you and Linus for the generous and thoughtful collaboration.
Talent/Phoenix ?  I live in West Medford, those fires were crazy.
lttstore.com HAH
185 miles. 3hours of driving. “close”. That’s from on side of my country to the other side. That’s awesome of you!
I CANT ESCAPE LTT STORE PLUGS ON THIS CHANNEL EITHER AAAAAHHHHH
And this is why the PC community is so awesome!
thanks for the smoke :)   It was taken care of quite quickly    regards from Washington
Noctua craft computing edition when?
Linus: "since he lives up the road--" CC: 9:04
This is amazing, subbed. You and Linus are awesome for doing all this 😊
Spencer looks so cute oh my lord..
maybe not dox spencer lol. that was mad info about where he stays
Everybody liked that
God damnit, I am genuinely thinking of going to lttstore.com any buying a water bottle. The LTT group know how to place an ad well without disrupting the flow and now you do it.
How depressing to see all those desolate burnt out lots in the area :( good on you for setting this bit of relief up for Spencer!
This is how many people where sent by linus:   |   |  V
even he had to do the LTT store plugin 😂😂 #Linussyndrome
Good man! Subscribed!
Man that neighborhood got fucked hard, A lot of stuff that can't be replaced was lost.
It felt great to watch u help one of the brothers who lost his computer. Thank you Craft Computing and Linus. May god bless you 🙏
put commen
I came hear from LTT and found I was already subbed so I left a like. Nice thing you guys did, I know what it's like to lose your stuff in a fire.
Came here to "see is face when he gets it".. Then I realized masks because covid so no face to be seen anyway. Oh well, at least he's happy :)
watchhing this after linus's video
Pretty close? 185 miles is pretty close? That's more than twice the width and more than half length of the country I live in.....
just in time
Hey Im in Salem! Lets be friends!
5:28 this is terrifying view
Why did no one mention that Spencer was Gabe Newell's son?
This is a heartwarming content... Subscribed and notifs are on man❤️
Very nice!
That was wholesome!
deym! they really replaced his computer! so lucky.
wow man, when i heard up the road on the ltt video i thought 10 mins tops but 185 miles?? amazing
Lttstore.com was a perfect placed ad. Funny!!!! Made me chuckle
Lttstore.com
LTT shameless plug. Nice job Linus.
Coming from a fellow Oregonian, I wish Spencer the best! Also, great vid, it was awesome of you and Linus to replace his PC.
5:12 That joke is way funnier when you're not expecting it.
I was laughing so hard at the LTT store plug then 5 seconds after I'm like oh no holy$#@#
Wow what a champ. Volunteering to drive 180 miles to deliver a computer to some random guy on the internet.
This is what I call PCMR Wholesomeness ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Been a subscriber to both and what a great collaboration!
So linus gave the impression that you lived basically down the road. 5mins into the video and I can safely say that it was indeed not true XD
Great video!
Kudos for doing the segway lttstore.com
we all know who sent us here...
Who else was here before Linus's endorsement? Haha
thats epic
this was a wonderful collab
Thumbs up for the LTTStore.com  plug.
Loved the LTTStore.com
Whos coming from LTT? :)
This is gonna be the most viewed video on his channel oh god haha
Just a 3 hour drive?  *laughs in Texas*  All jokes aside this is an awesome thing you guys were able to do. Hopefully it makes his year just a little bit better.
I think spencer could use a break from gaming...
Btw this video is only 20 minutes old but there are comments that are 5-7 hours ago..?
This is so heartwarming
noice
Good video👍 You can tell how excite he is!
Ltt fans dropping by here:)
Respect +
Look at that huge thing
Hello, I came from LTT to watch the sequel
Never thought I’d see someone with the balls to point out Linus’ flaw. Unfortunately the way linus is he would say fan controller isn’t necessary at all even he’d probably whine about it as well
The intel robot on your dash is probably the best dashboard decoration I have seen.
Great stuff man
I came here to laugh not to feel🙂.
watching this after the The WORST trade I've EVER made, so sent by linus

Here from Linus's video
You've earned my subscription. Kodus.
Nice
instant like!
I was waiting for that video.
5:10 still got ice in my llt waterbottle
great stuff, great video :)
Awesome!
Lovey gesture, very well done. Absolutely heart-breaking to see that devastation.
Was this really a craft computing video? Missing the beer review. Sure you had to drive and drinking and driving is not ok, but for sure you had a drink while you were testing if the computer works!
Great work Craft Computing and Linus Tech Tips!
Where's the LTT build video? I don't see the link.
Nice one guys 👍
08:52  What everyone came for
First
