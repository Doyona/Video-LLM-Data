I build these exact type of drones as a hobbiest. I use them for freestyle tricks and maneuvers . Also for filming cinematic footage. I hate they are using our hobby in war
5:56 not how the war started!
excellent video reportage . thanks
Hamas needs some drones.
im watching this a week after the drones hit Russia bases! good stuff!
i came back here after Spider Net operation - still amaze by the tech WOW
heaven 4 fpv drone pilots
Really appreciate your work. Please keep it up.
Hello from Ukraine. This is true. Thank you for help. Please, help us more)
🛰️
God Bless and please protect Ukraine.
Hey::  if everyone is using drones, let's move the people out of the way, and just use the drones and robotics . Save the soldiers.🤔😊
Johnny.. you are a best btw
Not sure if you or the team will see this but many people are interested in understanding the NPT  of 1994 that Ukraine and others signed. Why isn’t being enacted and spoken about on a grander scale. Did my own research on it but your channel always goes in-depth and has great explanations. Please consider making a video on the topic. Looking forward to see what you guys are working on now.
Is iz harris your wife?
Ну что, сынку, помогли тебе эти дроны?
I'm sad my hobby is being used for war; this will end hobby RC flight in many countries before too long.
Slava Ukraini!!!!🇺🇦💪🇱🇹
Johnny Harris, What were you thinking?  In this video you have given sufficient information and pictures of the faces of theUkrainian making these drones that Russia can “target these people”! What were you thinking?  If you want to save lives, then you should warn the people in your video!  The Stupid War in Ikraine has to Stop!
Probably shouldn't of showed there faces they could be targeted. Common sense journalism
I think a natural progression to the drone story would do go further into the US small drone evolution. With all the rumors and drone activity in NJ has allot of people linking drones to UFO activities and high altitude balloons. I’m sure it will be hard to anything in depth on such a wide controversial subject but you’re doing such a great job. I don’t comment on each episode but they are all so thoughtful and well written and informative.
I have been watching a Johnny Harris marathon. you are an inspiration to all Podcasters that are trying to broadcast the truth. Great job!
100.000 swarm drone atack simultanous is so soo dangerous now!
lol their drones FTMP are not like the one Johnny uses for his videography. Not to be a jerk, I’m just saying, FPV drones differ quite a bit in design and plotting between custom fpv drones and regular consumer. The custom drones are cheaper, made for specific jobs and they are getting away from DJI and building their own proprietary technology
It was you all along
6:02 no bro the war has started because of zelensky
Drones really are the future of warfare. Scary as a soldier tho having to worry about drones also
So if there building there own drones why we sending billions of dollars to them for drones?
me watching this in dec 2024 as drones are hovering over california and nj
Russians never told Ukranians to pick a side, but to be INDEPENDANT! NATO is the bad guy! And its boss the USA!
Cool commercial bye
As a small input. To my understanding companies like Palentir are working with Ukranians, on AI for drones. So when signal is lost due to jamming, they're able to continue the mission. Scary stuff
Angry Birds
Its not an invasion per say, i know thats what the propaganda says but its a disarming campaign... you wont know this yet you may even argue but when it's over you'll see Ukraine will remain independent even after they lose... idk if they will lose but i dont see how they can win. It will probably end with some kind of agreement.
And now, the Leonidas has dropped. Time to see how the Drone makers intend to subvert it.
For Ukraine its resist invasion, for Palestine?
Slava,,,,, Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦
Those killer machines, and thats what they are, will produce lot of headache to mankind. They are not exclusively for one side.
Thank you for this video!
Listen these guy have revolutionized war,combat, ect.....I did see that the Russian military can jam there signal but they kept sending the drones and got the kill after the 4th one.....
This video doesn't even show up on his channel's own main page. It likely didn't flop because no one is interested, but because some setting is screwed up somewhere or YT hates it, lol.
Just found out about this! Freestyle pilot from the U.S. wanna help build specific Drone Builds for war Recon & battle purposes as well as surveillance purposes and long range hits! Would the Government Contract A Drone builder as in buy them by the thousands if so I’m in if can be done legally fill me in please.
The Mexican drug cartels also use drones to attack their opponents and cause havoc on the people of Mexico 🇲🇽
Not a flop, Johnny H.
Believe it or not I was dreaming about this kind of warfare 39 years ago when I was 10 years old. It is so weird to see this actually happening
Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦
This video didn't flop. It's just that you have set such a high bar.
Kids playing games because they never have to face the actual consequences of their actions. The world is going down and they play games.
Drone warfare is cowardly
I'm from Ukraine, 25 yo, and first off big thanks to you Johny for spotlighting the war in my country. I really hope that the US nation with your help will become more aware about the enormous importance of supporting Ukraine in that conflict. If I was about to say about only ONE THING it would go like this:  "We didn't want that war, we were never militaristic. We literally gave up all our nukes and Tu-160 bombers in exchange for you guys to keep us safe. But the Russians are crazy, they dream night and day about invading and killing and slaughtering. Believe me when I say you can't reason them, convince or use ANY civilized method. The only way for us is to strike back as hard as possible"  I hope you will see this cry for help and attention. I hope you tell your politicians to send more military aid ASAP because otherwise, we'll end up in one massive grave and the rest of the world will follow within 20-30 years. Don't let that happen, we are just the same as you. We want to be alive just as much as you do. Шануймося, Слава Україні! 🇺🇦
Patriotism at it's finest!
Impossible to watch with the terrible music!!!!
Or we could just let T end the war. But that would require a little more looking in the mirror, now wouldn't it, Johnny?
Awesome report, thank you for sharing.God bless UKRAIN!😊😊😊
The fact you can do am interview like this shows how fake this war is
11:18 What's the name of that flying wing drone? Any similar designs?
Thankyou for the video love from krimlin headquarter
Ukraine heroes are smart in tactics against invaderPutin.   I like thr weapon"the cheaper Drones" but killer, effective ,accurate in war. Drones can move in any direction,small not easy target,with night vision and camera..destroy any big tanks,artillerys,ammu.depots.    Drones are small cheap weapon but  can defeat giants war weapons.
If I may…make a suggestion.  It’s time to evolve back to fix wing ordnance carrier. RC airplane
nah but a tx16s being used as the prefered remote of bomber drones has got to be good marketing right?
Great video and so important!! Glad your short directed me over here :)
Amazing keep the Drone work up literally
Seems pretty cowardly to me killing people that cant kill you
The FPV drone is like the new age sling that David killed Goliath with
its crazy, the advertizing you have is making idiots believe theyre buying a jacket but its a jacket shaped carpet for the bathroom or something like that.

Here's the Dep't of the Army request he quoted:  https://media.defense.gov/2024/Mar/06/2003407040/-1/-1/1/ARMY_SBIR_244_R11.PDF
This China is going to block the materials for drones for Ukraine only. Not for Russia. They issued a recent ban on exporting from the beggining of this autumn which you can check on the web if you want to.
So good to use your journalism to support a conflict which could have been ended years ago, but bias narrative sells right!
Thank you for this video and for supporting right side of the war.
Just amazing. Such a great vid.
Thanks
Good luck UKRAINE!!!
June 10, 2022. Remember this date. This is the first successful use of a FPV kamikaze-drone in combat (by Signum squad) the beginning of a new era
🟦🟦🟦🔱🟨🟨🟨     👍👍👍
Jonny, I see millions of data every day, and it crazy in the underground world. Nothing is hidden.
The good news for me is the fact i don't buy stuff online, and all my accounts and profiles don't have my information. I don't have my SIM card in the phone. And they really don't want to check the browsing history 😆
Great video!
Hopefully Tech to Tech Conflict Future Only!
Please don’t give too much information away. It’s not just friendly people watching. Don’t show radio equipment.
bro the audio in this is aids. the first minute, the music is too loud, and you can't hear the narration. Then, by 2:36, someone decided to add some terrible and dramatic wooshing noise. This is just a bad edit. Feels like the quality of this channel has gone down, especially since the channel journalist practice was called into question.
We love it 💗 Big support from Memphis TN
War did not started like that it started when NATO expanded
You totally skipped over the part of where all the cheap fpv drone parts come from.  It's China.     The escs, motors, Flight controllers, vtx, radios, goggles, lipo batteries,  all from China.
What a disgusting manor of warfare drones are....
Слава Украине!
when the USSR was fighting in Afghanistan, for peace there, the United States helped the Mujahideen.Then they fought with the Taliban there! Now Russia is fighting the Nazis of Ukraine.And the US is helping evil again.Then, most likely, the United States will fight the Ukrainians itself.
Good job! Cool docu kuddos to you and your team! 💪🏼
Hey @Johnny Harris, I just saw your clip talking about why it's important to keep giving our attention to Ukraine, and how This video didn't get enough views when it came out a while back. It might be useful to know that I saw this, and didn't watch it because I didn't realise that it was about Ukraine.
5 million subs, 1 million views, and we still have to watch a sponsor for a platform they already pay you for your content? I'll only watch sponsors on small channels, and at the end of the video, jsyk. Not liking, not subbing.
... ну шо там ???
Royalty free music?
beautiful thinking here !
Lose the music
Yes. War will never be the same. Neither will Presidential assassinations ...
do you have a way to send donations to Ukraine?
What monitor do you use? It's not on your gear guide.
I like your shop lighting. Very nice.
While these drones have proven to have given a tactical advantage there are weaknesses that limit its strategic and logistical value . Namely 1. battery power 2. Radio  Jamming 3.  Range and speed.  Time to target being dictated by battery charge power . And speed with obstacle whether that be physical natural or man made barriers or radiological jammers .  Though more sophisticated drones have obstacle avoidance sensors these suck battery power .  So if theres an improvement path its probably in improved battery duration and possibly speed  response time .  All reminds of anti sub warfare game of british ww2.  Where a large over seeing control room could coordinate smaller units direction to the contact point for  offensive or defensive action.  Though it appears the volunteer spirit has conducted a robust defense  ad hoc it still remains for better coordination on the grander scale to improve its strategic and logistical importance . No doubt small reconaissance type units will benefit from 360° peripheral warning of contact points but drone direct to direct countermeasures will no doubt emerge like single aircraft dogfights which is another level of need . Even submarine like air hair nets could be imagined as a sector obstacle defense channeling remaining vectors into kill zones to protect critical infrastructure.  Helium balloons rigged . The swing away from most big expensive  fixed wing aircraft has strengths and weaknesses  but at small arms and even artillery ranges the drone air 5000 feet and under space is a game changing blunting vector instrument. Adding to the combined arms attack defense mix . 🎉😢  at present mostly a tactical advantage until larger long distance targets of logistical and strategic value can be acquired . Time speed distance value .
The possibilities of this. Wouldn't need a lot of resources to be a complete PITA. Sobering.
Love this video
Instead of "No matter how much it takes for Ukraine to win, Russia is still fucked," try "The longer this war drags on, the fewer children Ukraine will have until it is completely fucked."
The reason for the special military operation in Ukraine were completely omitted from analysis. I stopped listening then.
You are not immune to propaganda
Ça reste horrible quand même
This is my guy
The kid at 00:10 is deeply broken.
Ukrainian soldier: “ put a heavy blanket over your fighting hole. Those fucking drones will park it right up your arse”
keep on pressing UKRAINE...
Very interesting report!
So they are using their own money for the drones, where is all that money going sent over from Biden? Yep. Scam.
This is nothing new. DJI became prominent because of the Chinese military effort, I assume, since the US has surrounded China with missiles at the Nine-dash line (A version of the Monroe Doctrine). Due to their limited battery life, Drone a good defense device but not an offensive weapon. That is quickly adapted as a terrorist weapon in the US. The US carriers are expensive and extensive, this can put the US in a significant disadvantage while it takes 10 to 15 years to build a carrier.
I wouldn’t be surprised if the cheap drone is analogous to the IED meaning that it’s cheap, effective, and difficult to defeat and Ukraine doesn’t necessarily have to win…they just can’t lose.  Now in Ukraine, volunteers with no tech experience can take a course to learn how to build drones
Is the UK government helping these drone builders with funds?
@velocidrone
Diy chinese kit drone😂😂😂
This is horrible.
i just wonder how long until radar can pick up something as small as a drone
I had the idea of equiping a drone with more radio frequency hardware to act as a signal booster, to extesnd your operating range and decrease the operating payload on the drone at the end of the extended signal.... When i was in highschool all the way bavk in 2009 and no one thought my idea had any value. Im always too ahead of the game eith very little help to manifest whst ive got envisioned
Johnny, I have 5 3D printers, along with more then 50 rolls of filamment and nothing to print. There is nothing better I would like to do then to contribut drone parts to support Ukrane.
SNIPERS HAVE BECOME SECOND CLASS OR OBSOLETE.
Cool we have AI fpv content please
Nice map!  It's flat anyways.    =)  Nice reporting btw.
I’m trying to buy a used DJI FPV before they ban the company here.  Things are getting nuts with US regulation as well.  Something the Nazis were fond of, a metric fuck ton of regulations and government goons to make sure individuals that want to be actually free that they aren’t.  Nazi gun grabbers are the biggest threat to our future, not Russia or China.
I always wonder how much of these insights are useful to the enemy. The average person doesnt have the same necessity level to think with this info from the enemy's pov so it seems like just another interesting story.
The fact you keep calling them cheap hurts me
WELL THE YANKS SHOULD HAVE KEPT OUT OF AFFAIRS THAT ARE NOT THEIRS AND YET 500K KIA OVER 1 M INJURED ...YOU TOSSERS CANNOT SEE YANKS ARE USING YOUS
Population of Ukraine 38 Million  and Russia 141 Million Ukraine is definitely punching way above their weight class despite what the propaganda news claims.  Big Bank take Little bank, somebody's getting rich.  I like this PBS-esque yt channel.
Thanks man💙💛 Support Ukraine
We already have these hidden secretly in us army not marine or other but army has it
Why won't you talk to Israeli's on the ground defending THEIR county?! of course you won't.
not only the Pentagon is watching but so is Beijing. The Chinese are trying to find a way to neutralize the US navy as it stands in the way of its conquest of Taiwan.
the Ukraiian use of drones is very innovative using them as artillery spotters direct attack unit. also the Ukrainians have recently fielded autonomous AI drones which can autonomously target without a human controller, and is immune from Russian ECM jamming.   Russian soldiers including recently interviewed foreign volunteers in the Russian army say they fear Ukrainian drones the most.
both sides use drones in the Ukraine war however the Ukrainians are more innovative with superior command and control along with having drones very much intergrated with their units even down to the squad level.   The Russians on the other hand also have a lot of drones but its the bigger military type ones, they dont have much of the FPV type drones.  and its not integrated much with the regular Russian army troops. Most Russian army troops dont even fly drones.  this is more used with specialized Russian special forces units.
Given how much money has been invested in weapons and weapon technology in the past, its amazing how much damage is being inflicted right where its needed from such mundane technology.
Thanks, Johnny.
is anyone else realizing that US is sending them all this money and they are going to lose while simultaneously wasting all of the money by handling the entire war with volunteers and people who have no combat experience . Their best defense is to kamikaze drone everything. This is the single biggest waste of money I've ever seen.
Understand Johnny why Putin did what he did to Ukraine! The United States cia has multiple biological weapons labs in Ukraine on Russian borders along with the United States using Ukraine as a playground for financial theft along with the violation of the Minsk agreement! Ukraine was a playground for very nefarious United States activities!!! You and many human beings are missing many many legal and devious nefarious criminal things that the United States cia criminals were involved in doing in Ukraine!! If these Ukrainian soldiers are pissed it’s the US and nato’s involvement for the cause of all this horrible destruction of Ukraine!!! Also the de-nazification of Ukraine is what Putin’s goal is!! Nothing more nothing less!! Get all your facts and information right about this horrible war! As an American I don’t like what’s going on in Ukraine either!!!
KZB can easily identifies them by showing their uncovered faces. You should be more careful while making this video.
Great, so now peaceful hobbyists are going to struggle finding parts for their FPV recreational drone, because military FPV drones are being spent at the rate of 10,000 units per month. We already lived through a shortage of flight controllers... This could expand that to VTXs, motors, cameras, etc.
Imagine that, you partnered with a propaganda piece and wonder why so few people cared about your video. The constant lying is what got to many people I know, lying about how Ukraine is really doing, as a regular person you don't know what to believe anymore so you stop caring altogether. I thought lying was the Ruski thing, we westerners were so much more evolved and ethical...  In one news story Russian soldiers are shooting their officers because they have no ammo and won't take suicidal orders and in the next Ukraine needs more funding, is running out of people and are facing setbacks... things massively don't add up.  Lying works to grab attention for a short while. When the truth comes out with time all trust and most of the interest is lost, people don't feel good spending treasure on liars and fairy tales.
It’s hypocrisy to me that when proposing Ukrainian resistance the world decides to call them heros who stand for their country that has been invaded only recently and that’s actually what they should do, but on the same universe when a nation that has been forcefully occupied by outside governments for 75 years ( yes it is Palestine) the world decides to call their resistance “terrorists” and don’t even acknowledge their right to defend themselves. What a world mate
DIY yippie!
15:25 strapping explosives to small consumer drones.
11:00 informal drone economy
8:53 strapping explosives to cheap drones
8: 18 Russians can jamb the symbols and make the drones useless. Rise in FPB drones.
Video needs more views
So, all these months later. We can sort the propaganda a little. Russia is moving in and Azov dont take orders. Ukraine is unable to abduct enough men and boys for battle field fodder.
China could mass produce those drones as much as you need at a low cost. Some producers (no need to be dji)in China as long as they’re paid are willing to do it.
SLAVA UKRAINE 🤙 from Minneapolis Minnesota USA 🇺🇦🤝🇺🇸

Great job buddy!  Well done doc
Cute! But you left out the part where Ukraine bombed their own people for 10 years prior to the Russia annexation.  Convenient that you push the West's agenda, and leave out this extremely important fact. Ukraine bombed for 10 years their political opposition, and the world let them.  Now the most corrupt country is laundering money for other world leaders, AND YOU ARE HELPING THIS CORRUPTION! CONGRATS!
I am so glad for these brave non binaris people who are standing up for the rights of boing, lockhead Martin, Goougle, Astra Zelenski, William Gates and the World Enomsical Forum.
Russians have more drones by now in May 2024.
It’s hard to watch just cause I know this is war and both sides are posting their kills on kaotic.
年纪轻轻不赶紧去填线😂😂😂
tiem to pick up FPV drone as a hobby so when i get drafted they cant put me on the front line w out a headset
Seemed interesting, but the "music" was too annoying. What is the point of constant repetitive beeping and bleeping, it is just noise. Make a version without it and double your views.
🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺
They can thank the American tax payers.
If these same heros were in Gaza they would be called Hamas terrorist rn.
Will any one train me
Using other drones for signal repeaters is a good idea.

Meanwhile we could make them more here in america without the fear of attacks
Ur camara model and mike details
So drone EWacs?   data link lol ?
Drones are so scary. Imagine releasing them in a school.
So if we are already impoverished we can aford either the anti spam or spending moey on only perchance succes never mind all the other gizmoes all blocking your way always wanting more. Scam?
Nazis with drones
Thanks you very much for your wonderful technologies for drone.
Heroic Heart-breaking   There's just one thing you forgot to mention.  Country with nation as poor as Ukraine would never develop such weapon alone. Technologies were brought there by western allies.  Free of charge.   That doesn't take away ingenuity and resourcefulness of Ukrainians.  But it means thay with withdrawal of western support,  drones will disappear
Very detectable 2.4 6ghz
You mean made in China and viet cong
Loved this reporting —. However I worry about using the names and faces of these drone makers ….   May only be a few but if one of these guys has the ability to make drones to take out million dollar tanks and troop carriers — this one drone maker is worth a 100 troops and worthy of Russians trying to put special hit squads on them.    As for drone warfare— it’s our future !!!!   They can take out 1 soldier as well as 100s —-  I can’t picture anything more scary coming at me than a “ flock of highly maneuverable weaponized drones ..”.    Especially if they figure out how to silence those propellers.    On a separate note —. I read that the Air Force is producing less pilots which is making recruiting pilots for commercial fleets more difficult
What about the 3 low of Newton?!
I think what this video did not cover is that practically all of the drone parts they used to make these DIY drones are sourced from China. From the motors, to the receivers, to the video transmission system, to the controllers, to the FPV goggles, to the IC boards, even the frames. I don't recall any country that even has a supply chain for drone motors other than China.  The US tries to make these drones home-made but China is so dominant in the supply chain that all American-made drones are leagues more expensive than Chinese ones. In addition, the Chinese drones are far superior in everything compared to the Ameican made ones.
Support and donate Ukrainian resistance
This war is a war of hunter killer drones from black ops 2 or some shit this is truly scary shit for sure
IRAN today: It sure will never be the same....#IRONDOME=#GOALKEEPER

Wow, Putin can never win the people of Ukraine, 🇺🇦❤️
Will they open-source their data? I want to use it.

They will be droning America soon.

No wonder why I can’t get for parts 😂

drones would be more cheaper with non rechargeable battery for suicide bomber. lithium ion battery are expensive. think about why electric bicycles expensive than a motorcycle and where the costs concentrated
Excellent video, I was wondering why I can’t get drone parts…
This is a smart collection of war.

Please make an update video about the war in Ukraine
Did the customs give back Wiz Khalifa hoverboard or they just didn't want China technology
The Russians haven't established air superiority, though. As you may have noticed, with the number of Russian jets that have been shot down recently.
This video is biased in so many levels, that around the minute 6:00 I just want to leave. The war begins when the butcher Nuland organize a cue in Ukraine then the puppet government began to murder the people of Donbas. The funniest part is when the narrator said  "Survival of their country", Ukraine no longer belongs to the Ukrainians, Ukraine now belongs to hedge funds like Black Rock.
Well done.  Thanks.
🇮🇩❤🇷🇺💪
Wagner was using FPV drones in Syria in 2018. It's a myth that UA has ANY Tech lead over Russia. Russia uses more FPVs and also has long range Drones, Lancet+Zala HunterKiller autonomous drones that use AI to detect targets. UA has 30 HIMARs, Russia has TornadoS that is just as accurate but with longer range. Russia has unlimited ammo for TornadoS, UA has limited HIMARS rockets. RF also has Aviation long range PGMs and Iskander medium range ballistic missiles. Russia has an equivilent to every weapon UA has, they just have more and much more of the other more criticial warfare elements; Artillery, Shells, Manpower, tanks, APVs etc etc
Hopefully, Russia will NOT discover they can use drones.
FPV ucrania victory ❤
the drone drop munitions was first introduced by the FSA (free syirian army) and ISIS, i suppose ? then the Ukiranians employed it farther with bigger scale, this is awesome!
Great video thanks so much.  Keep up the fight Ukraine.
jammers have never become more important and further more decrypting these transmissions of enemy drones (foreign or domestic)
"Video flopped..." 1.2M views
You want troops for drone warfare, pay X $ to any WarThunder & Ace Combat player, its a done deal my man, why spend all the hassle in looking for recruits that have to fit certain profiles, when you can find them in any online competitive matchmaking,  In the modern age, you can recruit whole squadrons of all old-school arcade gamers and have the biggest open-world battle royal, hell we should have a kill counter on the screen, gods I hope I get recruited, my price tag if 15.000 a month
War.  War never changes….
Imagine if Bin Laden had this technology...
Ukraine is escalating geo political dispute into a full scale nuclear world war.. but I respect thier patriotism..!!please find a way to end this war..!!
Yes, drones are extremely important but the War in Ukraine still resembles the old style of warfare where the most important weapons are artillery shells. This is why we can't watch this conflict and think it's the way of the future cause neither side has an advanced air force.
How do they even create a button on your controller to release those shells? How do they even control the opening and lock mechanism of the quick release, they used 3d printing only how? I am seriously interested in that engineering. @ me when you know the answer.
👍
🙀🤔👍👏🏻🙏🦅
Ukraine: take any warhead, use duck tape to attach it The US: we gonna need $1,000,000,000 to develop the warhead and attachment mechanism
A drone can carry a helicopter rocket 🤯
Okay now make video on Palestine Israel War
Johnny, ISIS was using this tactic in Mosul in 2017. Also using DGI phantom.
Yea, and they are still losing. Also, did you noticed that all the remote killers A.K.A. "drone operators" are just geeks that will not last a second if he was the one on the receiving end. How surprising right.
Ukraine had become yet anouther testbed for a powerful states attempt to oppress a population, with few resources and wealthy corrupt politicians.  When will the top down controlling oppressors learn, occupation and forced oppression is always destined to fail?
Haven’t seen a video from Johnny in a while my sub and notifications were turned off not sure how
Thanks!
I've been building and flying racing quads for many years now. The view with the goggles means that the pilot is virtually riding IN the drone. It's an amazing hobby. And those quads can be damn fast. My fastest currently is good for about 187KPH in short bursts.
The volume of the music is unbearable!
that loud noise in the beginning made this unbearable to view
People in Japan called the typhoon Kamikaze "God Wind"which  destroyed the Mongolian invaders in the 13th century.
War has so changed since the 80s doctrines where would you mass your troops and armour out of sight and range of drones and still have an effect in the field  tunnels maybe or tiny cheap swarm drones to saturate an area and kill off any other drones or significant targets of value   🇬🇧👍🇺🇦
Great program!!!
Seems like too much information is be shared and key people and strategies being exposed. This is something that should be restricted in times or conflict.
Does someone have the pdf document shown in minute 15:55? :)
Not sure if there is a, reason to smile. Cheap drones taking down large mechanized army.   Imagine drones used by jihadists and/or other enemies of US. Suddenly you loose your superiority.
Drones are modern age Kamikaze
15:05 the angry birds patch made my day, and made think, what about a fpv drone, that also has some kind of 2 or 3 second burn booster, so they can be the yellow bird, aproach and then when near, burn the booster and hit the target before losing conection
These guys are evil, Hatred is their motivation...
This will be bought by countries that will fight china. But, it will be illegally copied by china although their version would not last a single flight due to cheap quality materials and corruption by government officials.
And now they’re policing fpv here at home. Hmm I wonder why? Maybe democracy is being destroyed here as well. Js
When there is terrorist Drone attacks all drones will be banned 🔥🔥🔥

Civilian drone developing that thing can be deadly , iwas a kid and thinking drone it can be used to war that was I was thinking we should use a kid mind to develope war machine
Been visit Indo Defence Expo & Forum 2022. Just right after Ukraine & Russia war started, there is a lot of manufacturer make c4 mavic modified drones and drop missile drones. This is new way how to war
It’s the only way we can be free
They should make one with the Torric on it
imagine If civillians are able to build new "scary" hi-tech weapons of war in their garages now , send them directly to the people interested, "dispersed" weapon industry got whole new level
They wrent using dji drones why waste the money on digital signal...they had skyzone goggles with analog feed....cheaper and more reliable for distance.....they use long range 7 or 8 in drones mostly
After the War Ukraine 🇺🇦 will become the world's leading source for the defense industry tactical Drone warfare for cheap and effective quality deadly drones. 30-50 years Later they will be one of the Top in the World. When Israel 🇮🇱 and Ukraine Partner up to joint venture Deadly Defense Drones their combine efforts will soar high to developing highly effective Low cost new technological developments the world will turn to these businesses for their future warfare
They should create and promote a website with the blueprints for everything they need, that anyone with a 3d printer can donate to. Have a few hubs in key countries to recieve and inspect the parts.. then deliver Ukraine.
16:56 это тебе, а не русским :)
So, some guys are assembling drones, then other guys stick granade on the drone and flight with that into enemy. For that I really do not need your 20minutes long video.
As someone who has built and flew fpv drones from the early days of fpv this is heartbreaking, many of us saw the possibilities of drones used as weapons from their first flight but I certainly didn't forsee this level of destruction, theyre using the very equipment that our community developed for fun to be used for death.
China is working for Russia
The wars in the future will be fought by nerds on computers using drones
Drones are nothing new
Putin commissioned mega drone city two years ago , a whole city to top tech drones , I bet the way the build it will probably be built sometime soon .
Come and visit Ukraine . You re welcome and will find hospitality and support. First hand impression meeting people for real. Get  the glimpse or larger understanding
If I can fly the drones from America to help in them in this war I would!
FPV for the kill...?
Soon these devices will no longer need a pilot.
This is awesome for the defence and the innovation of the people but it’s only going to make other nations more tight on drone security, these clips of watching drones fly into military is fair enough but what about when someone bad gets there hands on them and sends them at idk schools or churches any public place. Feeling like this is going to ruin the hobby and place even more restrictions on it. (That being said I don’t justify what Russia and Ukraine are doing war is an awful thing and I agree that they have to do what they have to do)
Please don’t stop covering the war in Ukraine! We need people to know what’s going on we need people to care!!!!
Thank you. Really interesting. Glory to Ukraine. 🇺🇦 shame we helping with such a small effort. We have a lot of Abram’s.  Bradley’s. And so on. We need to support extremely sooner and bigger.
You consider 1,2 million views a flop?
“I need to tell u about spam” . oh the irony
What we spend to help them we get back in R&D.
Мягких прищемлень та эффективных вильотів 🤝🇺🇦🔱⚓
Today CIA data came out related to the multiple offices threatening Russia  I bet you're already on it
What a crazy story.  Imagine how some recent wars would have played out if this approach had been used by some of the "smaller parties". I guess the infrastructure wouldn't have been able to exist,  but even at a smaller scale,  it could have been devastating.
Damn Johhny, not to take away from the importance of this story, but that is a huge monitor!
Where do I sign up?
No this is bad. Theres a company that wanted to prevent this from m happened in the past
It's funny because standard kamakasi drones for  was predicted to be used years ago.   The reason why they priducted this was to explain and answer the question of what future terism would look like
respekt to those builders
Stupid war
Obama Biden Lindsay Graham 2014 war crimes green light
эх, 1в1 как с нашей стороны)) Тарасики сдавайтесь, переходите на сторону исторической родины)
Thanks
Who ever  edit the music ! You're  bad
Nice video, like nearly all your videos, only the "war" didn't start in 2022, this is a misconception Johnny It started in 2008 when Victoria Nuland started to sponsor the opposition of the ProRussian government of UA UA is pushed into this war the USA wanted and EU helps provide trying to break up Russia
Please mark your own spam with chapter markers, sir.
When people are unfamiliar with aviation and payload capabilities you can manipulate them. Sad that war is being used to fearmonger and drive regulations. Who is funding this propaganda?
How did you not manage to mention australias sypaq WAXED  CARDBOARD DRONES literally breakthrough technology
"this is where war becomes almost scary"🫣 becuase it was all fun and games  before drones...
“They’ve quickly gained air superiority” Incorrect. The’ve never gained it and it was often stated by military experts as the major reason why their offensive has stalled and failed so quickly.
That last remark went hard as f*ck.
Don’t even need war. These things will be used on the public.
This is where a plug for Brilliant would make sense. 9:45
I built RC planes since childhood. Since 2012 I build FPV drones. My hobby turned from being a cool high tech hobby to weapons manufacturing.
Thanks for your work! I'm a Ukrainian civilian for now, a few months ago I finished an engineering course and already created 6 FPV drones in my bedroom. Already handed them over to our military.  We have to be smarter, faster, more creative, or we all die. That's how simple it is
This shït is why they will ban all drones in the US & Canada.
If only johnny actually supported Ukraine and shined a light on the civilian attrocities commited by the moskals in Ukraine. Thousands of civilans buried under rubble in Avdiivka. Ppl rotting under their destroyed homes and the ruschists are celebrating the genocide and the ecocide they are perpetrating. I feel like u should take more of stand for the good of the world. For example, explain what this russian ecocide is doing to beautiful Ukrainian lands. The dam they blew up, which they have had numerous ppl on their side that were there have admitted multiple times that they did it and why and also we have seismic activity to prove exactly when they did it and theres video of them entering the underground fscility where they placed the explosives around the time they blew it up and all that. But no one talks about that. No one brings attention to these crimes against mother nature and humanity
Russia 🇷🇺
Johnny, I saw a short you did where you suggest the unpopularity of this video has something to do with lack of interest in Ukraine.  That is a flawed conclusion for at least the following reasons: 1. "Ukraine" is not in the title.  2. Even if "Ukraine" was in the title, the topic of soldiers modifying/fabricating drones on the fly has been heavily covered since the beginning of the conflict, so is not much of a draw. 3. The "background" music at the beginning is louder that the dialog, which made me think the video had an editing error, so I skipped it the first time I started watching to revisit later.   I am a huge fan of your work in general, and the video is excellent and interesting as usual it turns out, but please don't conflate a tepid response to this video with public sentiment about Ukraine.
love the part where he said "easy to put together and cheap" 8:38 (Fpv drones are a pain in the ass to build and are far from cheap, although they are technically cheap to military standards)
Having those drone labs in civilian infrastructure in cities and neighborhoods just makes it a targeted if Russian intelligence finds out and it could cause stricks on apartment buildings
Relevant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmsXSk5VCXc&rco=1
Urina? Нет не слышали такой страны.
Why don’t you make videos like this on Palestine?
Great job, as always! Thank you very much for this video.
Cool how almost all the parts are made in China
Where are all the billions of dollars gone? Why have they got school kids building drones? The ukraine government busy buying luxury houses and super yachts
Help the palistainians against genocide.
free ukraine
I wish to see your faces, when you realise that there is already killer drones with several AI model channels for terain navigation, target identification and trajectory calculation in 800$. They are used right now, for at least 6 months. FPV has a lot of  points of weakness. AI driven drone is pure fear.
I think Russia fucked up 🥴
ukrainian gov't should start funding them
Incogni? ! Really .enjoy my name on the list lol getting crazy
Third grade level explanation
You think showing their faces is a good idea?
Its like WW1
Awesome video, thanks
I thought part of war was to destroy your enemies ammunition so they can't fight... so why are these guys still breathing?
$DRO ASX
just to clarify , the war didnt start 2021  it started in 2014 with the american coup upon the democratically elected leader of ukraine and the invasion of crimea by russia, the invasion of donbas was only part 2 . it is clear to anyone that russia s gangsters were provoked by american psycopath "leaders"
The end of war by cheapness!!!
A country like Taiwan or Philippines could do the same tactic. Create thousands of cheap FPV drones, teach young men and women on how to use it so if all hell breaks loose, they know how to use it. China is up to no good. Instead of spending millions on big ticket military items, build drones locally instead. The next war will be a DRONE WAR.
Canada needs to start producing drones for the military
Excellent video
Same thing is going on in Iraq and Syria
I can't say I'm excited about this development. It's one thing when it's happening thousands of miles away, but when this sort of equipment is accessible to any whacko living near me, it's scary to think what my hobby could turn into.
The building of drones are needed what is absence is your ability to defend against drone swarms of hundreds .Time to develop Anti drone swarm systems
Imagine you can destroy million dollar tank by a 500 dollar drone..
The future is a swarm of cheap, AI-powered, independent drones... electronic counter-measures - ineffective, air defense: just another target, armored vehicle- can't sustain armor against hundreds of small shaped charges.. They can be specialized to ho after humans or vehicles and there is no hiding from them, they will go into trenches, forests, buildings. basically whoever can afford more drones from China, wins
Put shaped charge on a drone
Hi guys sup? I couldn't found the document (https://media.defense.gov/2023/May/11/2003220790/-1/-1/0/ARMY_SBIR_234_R11.PDF)
Putin gets 1 billion $ every day for commodities. We must consume less oil and metals to weak his regime. Youtube in Russia is spreading his propaganda that's why it's not banned. Relatives and friends don't believes me.  Lies have become truth. Support Ukraine! If Putin wins , the world will face many dark years of confrontation dictatorships and the West.
Excellent video! Glory to Ukraine
The obvious continuation of the story is missing.: AI
I came here after you shared in one of your shorts that this video flopped  Was it strategy on your part?
I can imagine Sweden with some of their munitions like the bomb capsules from the "Bonus" artillery shells that has a sub munition that is a 100 meters up in the air flying in a helical search pattern and when detecting armor fires a molten copper jet right through 1 foot of armor from a height of maybe 50 meters up. Imagine those fairly lightweight munitions strapped to cheap frame drones flying out in swarms can take out 20 tanks in a matter of minutes. Especially if they have strong signals for anti-jamming.  This is the future. NATO militaries better get on it.  Create "drone Battalions" where they have tons of drone pilots being trained on these drones for surveillance and kamikaze attacks etc. Innovate different size of drones for munition drops and so on. Long range like Ukraine now does flying 1000km to take out targets.
But, but China is the king!
But why show the faces of the drone makers @johnny Harries
Just put all your there secrets info out there telling them what’s going they probably all ready no about Jamimg   an what the Ukrainian are doing just so you can make a blog
The enemy cannot watch youtube because of censorship in this way we can use that 2 our advantage
Excellent and honest work.  Well done.   👍
That t shirt explains a lot
Awesome!
Amazing! Great work. Glory to Ukraine!
Top notch reporting here!
The war is lost as they couldn't keep up with the Russians
Thank you for addressing this topic.
IF THEIR HITTING POWER GRIDS THEN HOW IN THE HELL DOES DUDE HAVE POWER?? Their not building em back that quick I know
Glory to Ukraine!
Man I thought I'd never be saying,,, go nerds!!! And I say it in a positive way! These brainiacs are stepping it up to the next level to protect there country!! And these drones are gonna get better and better as these young men get smarter and smarter..these guys are doing alot for there country and I support them 1000%%%%!!! Be safe guys and keep up the hard work! God speed!
This is some cyberpunk nightmare shit. Next we'll see Boston dynamic-esque dog murder bots or something.
There's a lot of videos of war crimes being committed by Ukrainians with these drones too
I just want to thank you for covering this topic and for not letting people forget about Ukraine.
How can I help?  I am a mechanic with a lot of electronic, hydraulics and electrical and mechanical knowledge
Thanks!
I would beg to differ I build my own drones and will be the first to tell you that any radio scrambler that is set to the right frequency's which are easy to find for drones will stop them. The problem with Russia is they only know tanks and tanks and tanks and meat anything else so far seems to confuse them. The have jammers however there seems to be very little and are really bad at deploying them once they figure out how to jam them it will be much more difficult for our heroes in Ukraine. They can go to pure GPS which is jammable  or laser which means they must be near by or satellite which is also jammable. The thing that bothers me the most is if Russia prevails they will use what the learn here to squash the rest of the world.  They have a horde mentality to rape pillage burn and enslave that is what they have done since the days that Gangues Kahn that had taught them. They will use the resources of Ukraine to help rebuild them selves and build even bigger tanks that have jammers installed on them. They will give their horde soldiers a Ukraine woman as a slave and property in Ukraine to farm I saw the commercial that they show in Russia to the soldiers. Yet all these nations that have paid Trillions defending against Russia will not even give the GPA equivalent to Ukraine that is in direct combat with the Horde ORC's.
the only trouble is, these are the Nazi aggressors since 2014. 🥸
I wouldn’t be surprised if autonomous drone weapons are being actively developed by both side.
A great definition of “civilian army”.
Great script!  ?
PS>> The Truth is the Nazi's are there. Underground evil. They took over Ukraine in the 40's. We are taking care (****) of them and keeping the REAL Ukrainians safe. The Truth is Ukraine is still Russia. They are One country. I hope this video is not propaganda. The Military Alliance and SPACEFORCE are watching!
Your looking at future Military Industrial Complex CEO that will be super wealthy and doing everything with their political influence to keep the wars going.  Too lucrative to stop.
Moral? It will take more than a few drone videos to boost the moral of country that has lost 500,000 men in Americas war against Russia.
Thank you for your support each and every one ❤ with love from Ukraine ❤😘
Дякуємо да допомогу кожному і кожній ❤
it's so cool when you understand what they say in two languages Це так круто коли розумієш що говорять на двох мовах (Ukrainian language)
Russia thought they could defeat Ukraine in a week. But it has been two years and Russian is still in a mess. So with Nuke Russia will be number 50 in military ranking. They have dumb soldiers that are not even trained.
This is why all the FPV stores are out of stock everywhere all the time this is really shitty because this is a fun hobby and gets fucking ruined by this shit. I can’t people just fight my hand so fist at each other and that beat it.
We need the optimus robots to aid our fellow Ukrainians.
Wait until we have "smart" drone that can flight by themselves
Kicking US out of the country would have stopped the war in the first place. Ukrainians are just pawns in US war games.
SkyNet rejoices at the radio-jamming techniques that will compel it's birth as an intelligent autonomous flash-mob swarm of killer apps.
Other than Ukraines war general and Zelenskyys mansions/ boats this is where our tax dollars have gone
I am in USA. I don’t care about Ukraine and their borders. the  Democrats do they should worry about my border. These guys in their little kits probably cost me $100 million.😢
12:50 Shooting these canons is not entirely a guessing game. I spent 3 years at Bragg in an artillery unit, the gunline has what are called forward observers who would radio coordinates for them to shoot. The forward observers are ground troops who are usually alot closer to the enemy. But you're right that they helped us adjust our shots for targets that we're moving
Africa learn that's what u need against france
Thank you for real journalism Johnny!
I'm pretty sure they will use blimps soon, too. At least for surveillance. At night those should be pretty much untraceable and fly forever.
1 million "Russian" views!
e
Excellente vidéo
Those dorks need to focus on GETTING LAID 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Drones have made main battle tanks obsolete just like warplanes forcibly retired all battleships worldwide
The war of the future is already here, in Ukraine. As a Ukrainian, I'm extremely grateful for covering such an important point, which is a real game-changer on the battlefield in the 21st century.
Hi can you help me with a drone am looking for
lastly you kinda miss pointing out also the range limitations of the drones ... the limited flight time of them ... and recon drones generally are much larger and can be seen on russian radar .. since they are generally over 3m wide and can sometimes operate even 15hrs where as the small kamikaze drones tend to fly only for 5-10min ... similarly there are weight limitations and payload vs battery size tradeoffs and these affect also the speed of drones ... so im frankly quite surprised at the poor coverage of the complexity even of the drone selection / modification but thank you for taking the time to make a video on the topic hopefully you might make a more accurate one/ detailed one in the future
similarly your understanding of artillery is pure horsemanure... drones replace the need for a forward observer on the  ground... so you dont need a guy with a radio map and *(binoculars optional) telling the artillery where to shoot ... regardless of how you fire the artillery at a target X it doesnt make it more accurate... thats not how artillery works... maybe good idea to study how artillery works and how/what CEP is... before making these videos as its clear you have ZERO understanding of the topic..
just fyi all these drones dji etc are essentially used as FPV drones.... so i dont know if you forgot to look up what FPV means but it really doesnt have anything to do with the drone per say... First-person view (FPV), also known as remote-person view (RPV), or video piloting, is a method used to control a radio-controlled vehicle from the driver or pilot's viewpoint  so it just refers to the method that you control the remote controlled vehicle which could be a ship car plane or quad or .... whatever really that you pilot remotely
Drones are now the new technology t that was already predicted the drone wars
me (an fpv pilot for fun) was super scared of 9:54 . props off while checking motors :D
Image if they could get those pro racing drone pilots I see on YouTube to fly these things, it would be badass
Johnny, at 6:10 the claims you started making simply aren’t true. Not at any point in the invasion either. And with this coming straight off a poorly placed in video ad that was enough. You make good content when you stick to what you know. Keep doing that.
BUT now at the Polish border packages aka thousands of drones are being held for weeks delaying these much needed supplies to Ukraine.😡
Best video yet keep it up
Solid work 💪 Keep it up.
Thanks!
Best video so far
This is all very well but basically it also gives free rein to terrorists. Given US support of countries thst seemingly committ geonicide the chances  are that we are in for a very difficult times ahead. Nothing to celebrste here its actually very sad that tgese toys are
Old news...
Thank you!! ❤🇺🇦
Unfortunately for Ukraine, the war is already lost.
Blue certified drones are all dogshit. Mediocre capabilities and high costs that DoD SBIR is destined to fail from the start.
Johnny Harris: Makes a war propaganda video. (Which even contains hate speech, not in English but it’s there) Same Johnny Harris: The video kind of bombed, wonder why 🤷‍♂️? I used to like this channel but is just like VOX again and it’s biases:
Lol, when I see people who, in their hatred, wear nationalist T-shirts calling for massacres based on ethnicity, I have big questions about the impartiality of this video. I have many Ukrainian friends living in Russia, but none of them met people on the street wearing “Kill a Ukrainian” T-shirts, because cruelty is limited to TV propaganda and in real life no one wishes anyone death or anything else.
Thank you for this video
Simps still pushing Ukraine's envelope...
So many details, I can’t even imagine how you were preparing this material
To support from all Ukrainians, from myself I’m leaving this particular comment
Thank you for supporting Ukraine💙💛🕊️
Thank you for the video. ❤
Thank you for your attention and supporting Ukraine!!!❤❤❤
As Ukrainian a huge thank you to you and your team for this video! War is not over.
Drone moment
Stand with Ukraine!
Thanks, mate 🤍🇺🇦
Slava Ukraini
would AI drones bypass the jammers? if the drones could make decisions independently would they need ground signals
Slava Ukraini
Seems like China's siding with Russia. Blocking drones sales to Ukrainians has a much larger impact on the war than blocking drone sales in Russia ...  Guess we know at least one of Russia's allies in this conflict ...
This is a really well made video, much better than I expected from a western journalist.  As far as I understand, the resource that we now need the most is not money or parts for drones, it's hands to assemble them, so we now have organizations that will teach for free in exchange for a drone you assemble and send them to be tested and sent to the front lines. There is a huge number of people that take part in this and some of them never even soldered before, but they want to learn and they do so successfully.
The first I saw a FPV race a couple of years ago I thought, that terminator was wrong. The futur won't be humanoid soldier but a swarm of machine gun drones.   I therefore started investing more into drone oriented Stock.   But I'm still amazed at how fast it came about.
This is like a high tech version of Red Dawn!
I’ll show this to my grandson, a history nut and war crazy kid. The future Of war !!
Funny thing is drones are touted to be replacing delivery drivers. But, they are replacing soldiers.
You need to add word "Ukraine" in the title - it's should sell stuff
I'm pretty sure the algorithm fucked you. It hasn't because it had no interest. Keep this stuff stuff up.
Great, the US government is asking the general population to get good at this.
Thank you very much for your work. If you have the opportunity, please continue to talk about Ukraine. All the best, thank you❤‍🩹
Damn.
You mentioned this video didnt do well and that discourages me / but its why it needs to be shared
At last Johnny made something really useful! Thanks, man!
🇵🇸
I don’t think it is an issue of people not caring about the war in Ukraine, but more so of people not quite wanting to listen to you talk about the war in Ukraine given your slight bias regarding the conflict and invasion in Palestine. I think people are not wanting to listen nor hear what you may have to say about Ukraine. Trust me, people who “have shifted their attention” to the conflict in Gaza have not forgotten the conflict in Ukraine. Additionally, it is also an issue of how long can governments continue to financially support Ukraine. I mean initial support is great but continued large financial support is an issue, especially if there has not been accointability of where and how the finds are used. Lastly, there are so many other conflicts in the world, perhaps the world (majority non-white) have realized that too much support of one conflict is just wrong. As humans, we have to voice out the other conflicts, especially in Africa, SouthEast Asia that are ongoing and probably much worse than the conflict in Ukraine. Ukraine will survive as there are too many countries already assisting. I guess everyone else is wondering what and how to support and turn attention to other more horrifying conflicts that are happening around the globe.
Crazy how you cover topic like these. Very biased. If Hamas was doing this ya woulda said they crazy.
Thank you for this insightful look at Ukraine's defense! May we all help them to keep our democracies safe.
My tears run down my face as I deeply sympathized the heroism of Ukrainians of defending their country.
slava ukraini
That might be completely true. But I think your video flopped due to the fact that it is focused (with an emphasis on the title) about a niche subject that most people are not really interested or know enough about to be interested which are drones. If you made a video focused more about Ukraine the video would do much much better, in my opinion
first world problems xd
Thank You for making this efforts known and giving people hope, humans are adaptable and it’s sad it’s come to this, but good always prevails❤
Thank you for making this video
Interesting report, but isn’t it risky to share transparently the names of those who provide vital equipments to Ukrainian forces?  Being sponsored by an anti spam company…  I don’t know the current intelligence level and response of Russian government, but it seems an unnecessary exposure, even with their consent.
It's incredibly fascinating how the world always paints Ukraine's resistance against Russia as impressive, courageous and admirable whereas any resistance from Palestinians against lsraeI's occupying forces is painted as nothing more or less than terrôrism.  This isn't to say Johnny's video is in poor taste or bad in any way, it's not, it's really well produced and presented as always; I am merely making an observation that there seems to be a notable absence of content praising or even acknowledging the ingenuity, valour and might of other resistance groups in their fights against their oppressors and occupiers.
Ever since the elections in Belarus I have bean pondering about open source warfare as a way to evade the aggressor.
Been a fan of your luts ❤
ХЕХЕХЕх Начали за здравие, кончили на Украину Я рад, что автор хоть кусочек сказал про Россию, хоть он и выступает за Украину, это хоть немного объективности Только вот проблема в том, что у одних 10 тысяч дронов в месяц, интересно посмотреть источники и статистику, а у других...  Давайте так, есть уже статистика с видео подтверждением 3 тысяч ударов fpv дронами с Российской стороны, это соответственно, видео которые выкладываются. Сколько не опубликовано - мы не знаем, ребята на фронте воюют, а не тиктоки про контрнаступление записывают Помимо fpv есть еще атаки ланцетов, у которых есть своя статистика с большее чем 1000 ударов, И есть вишенка на торте, это герани, привет 29.12.2023 Ну а раздичные видео со сбросами вообще никто не считает, ибо их слишком много
Great video about people fighting for their freedom. Hope you make a similar one about the Palestinians who have been going through the same brutal invasion for more that 70 years now without any aid.
Don't talk nonsense, as soon as you are on the Internet, your data is there and cannot be deleted, it is always there in the cloud
We’re not good with divided attention, especially in the US. But I’d be curious about all December viewership in the US. We’re even more myopic during the holiday season.
I saw that you posted a short saying that this video flopped because people don't care about the war in Ukraine. Personally, this video never showed up on my home page or recommended so it could be the YouTube algorithm
@johnnyharris why do you assume that Ukraine are the good guys?
This is amazing! I'm so glad you are supporting Ukraine!  Thank you – from the bottom of my heart.
0:10 well that picture on that T shirt....remembers me on mentality of that "moderate rebels" in Syria few years a go...if you know what I mean.
Russian are indeed using normal drones to their advantage. ❤🎉
I'm very much in two minds about this.  The more civilians are invested in the war, the less there are chances for a positive - and peaceful - outcome. Those people went for the kill, they are creating weapons that are actively used - something that is known to really fuck up with person's mentality. As the last phrases say clearly, they are dead set on exterminating Russians, and they are dead set that their kids, if need be, will continue their cause. This is real bad and participates in shattering any hope for peaceful solution.  I'm also sad that Johnny of all people, the person who condemns the war and tensions and calls for peace all the time, has took it so positively without a single note. Yes, it's a defending side. No, this is still wrong on so many levels.  Full disclaimer: I'm Ukrainian by father and Russian by mother, I reside in Russia and have relatives and close ones in Ukraine. I have no side in this aside from stopping people's suffering and deaths. This is not a game of political tensions. Every minute the war drags on, real people die and get injured - some of them I knew. And those guys certainly don't make it easier.
I've watched your videos for years, on different devices.  Just want to note this video didn't show up on any feed of mine.  I had to search for it, once you mentioned on your Short clip that this video "flopped".  Have your videos been throttled or limited in different countries or regions before ?  Thank you to the team for the great work you've been doing.
I saw a short about the fact that you didn't get many views of this video.  I am not sure what happened, but it looks like you got unsubscribed on my account. I didn't know the video came out and it never came up to view.  Your first video on the 2022 invasion I thought was one of the most brilliant ones of that time and frankly has held up well. I enjoy your videos.
Regardless if some of the world and mainstream media is moving on from the Ukraine and russia war many of us from all over the world are still watching and cheering and helping any way we can to make sure to always have a FREE UKRAINE! SLAVA UKRAINE!
hey, can you share a link to the drone proposal document?
Where’s the 100 billion in military aid and equipment we sent over? 😅
Cracking, informative and creative video, it is fascinating to see Ukraine at its innovative best.  Thank you.  BTW, that giant curved screen is outrageous- what is it?
I love FPV drones They’re my hobby for couple years You see the world from another point of view They really help me calm down when ever I‘m stressed I‘m really scared that even hard regulations will come now, because of the warfare
Don’t forget about the autonomous drone project as well
Amazing video Johnny!
Just commenting to boost this video in the algorithm
another lie the the US told by telling Ukraine don't sign the peace treaty and now Biden say WE AINT GOT NO MORE MONEY I NEED ANOTHER 68B before Christmas 😂
Please, support Ukraine - thank you Johnny for reminding the world we are in war
when civilian tech can easily produce mass kiling weapons at dirt cheap price, it'll haunt us back someday in the future. just imagine what the crazy jihads can do ...
Well, they are losing anyway.
Obviously everyone is tired its also because the media is heavily biased.... You just keep hearing the same lies.
No one cares. Move on
idc
If you can destroy a 2.2 million dollar tank that fires 10 thousand dollar ammunition and requires a crew of 4 people with a 500 dollar drone and a 200 dollar improvised bomb, you realize that tanks are obsolete technology.
Johny, thank you so much for drawing people's attention to our war! It is very important to highlight such stories and remind everyone that Ukraine is still fighting and needs continuous support.
I wouldn't have shown drone makers' faces or names. Knowing Russian methods, those guys' lives are now in more danger.
The repetitive annoying sounds in the background are … annoying and repetitive.
Wooha!
As an fpv race drone pilot, this is so bittersweet. I'm so greatful that Ukraine is able to leverage fpv for their defense.  On a totally selfish note, I doubt fpv will ever be seen as an innocent hobby anymore...which it is 99.9% of the time.
Thank you for this reporting.
Ukraine is outgunned by 50 to 7 drones
Just saw ur reel about how this video “flopped” and it was weird to me bc i didn’t even know you covered this subject and i watch all your videos religiously. I dont know why but this did not pop up in my notifications feed. Strange
I will bet the lawyers, judges, and politicians r the most wealthy professions in this country
I guess it's really becoming a strange ww1 trench warfare where the one who have any asset to control land is taking it and defend it. The problem I see, from the beginning, is that even with military or technology assets... Russia got the land and the resources and the people advantage... On the long term... they just sit on position and go forward slowly. AND they got the air control... I think they really just wanna break a deal and take the land they can and secure the people on their side into Ukraine and put the line the further possible of reasonable defensive reasons...
Issis also did this
Really great video, deserves more viewa
comment for the algorithm and the war effort
Really very sad to see this video becoming flop with less than a million views, sometimes useless topics cross 5 million
Got here from the short. Thank you for making this. Very interesting info about how Ukrainian troops are using the tech, and how it's going to affect war going forward.  I found the making of drones by volunteers particularly interesting. Perhaps this is one field which will help Ukraine bounce back economically post-war.
Eventually, this is going to be going on in America.  The globalists know this, but they just hope We The People can be distracted and killed off by applying internal subterfuge and insidious divisiveness between the people of differing views.
Ukraine needed to ACCEPT PEACE from Russia!  NOT work for the globalists who are profiteering from mass murdering both sides!!!  Had Trump gotten his rightful election, this would have never happened, because Trump would have ensured peace, both in the Ru/Uk tensions, but also the Cn/Tw conflict!
DJI as a company is only valued at around 15 billion dollars. With the money just America has sent they could have bought DJI 6 times.
As a long time manufacturer of this equipment here in the USA, this really hits hard... and as an expert in radio technology I see how this is done and can clearly see how this will escalate.  The good thing is that drones effectively keep human lives out of direct battle.  I forsee a day when war is simply robots battling each other with no humans involved.  If we can't eliminate war, hopefully we will at least eliminate the suffering it brings.
#ArmUkraineASAP
I'm so interested in how ideas spread. Our snow patrol has started using custom drones to drop explosives to break up snow in the mountains before they become an avalanch. I feel like they got the idea from the Ukranians.
There would be no war without engineers.
bruh, UNBLURRED guys in this vid will be targeted! BEWARE!
Imagine Ur angry neighbour learned how to make fpv boom 😂😂😂
I wish the migrants coming from south america would fight for their countries the way ukrainians do. Ukrainians would rather stand and fight than give up and land on our border…
Bardwell and UAV Futures have a LOT of bl00d on their hands.  All those FPV youtubers basically plugged all this and made the how to videos to enable a whole new legion of millenial k1llers.
Which fpv headset is seen here? \
Now i see why there's a chip shortage
Russia has achieved all its goals but American youtubers keep acting like it's even, a stalemate or russia is losing. Did YouTube threaten to demonetize the truth with Ukraine like they did with covid?
This video forgot one thing, China is the worlds largest commercial and consumer drone producer. This has already been balanced by russia. Its almost a drone stalemate until the Lancet drone production rams up.
And after that he refers itself as indepenfend journalism, muahahah
Ukraine has become strong on small drone technology
Coño Johnny Harris es pura calidad 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
Its cute how when non-browns start a grass roots effort to fight against an oppressive invading force, its a fight for survival, but for palestinians, its terrorism.
Are Russians not using the same drones?
Everyone has been lied to about the motive of this war. To fuel a propaganda machine that takes westerm countries tax money and funnels it into corruption and greed & big fat contracts for defense, instead of encouraging peace talks. For every cheap drone, there are millions being sent for other purposes.
Russia is winning the drone war in every way possible.
>>>>>>>>>> Just add 2 antennas to a drone and code em to target the strongest signal if it losses control, LOL <<<<<<<<<<
amazing
Great video. In war, running a jammer is considered one of the jobs with the shortest expectancy. When they triangulate your location, they drop a bomb on you within seconds. I'm surprised the Ukrainians don't develop jammer hunters. If the propeller arms are also used as antenna, then the direction of the jammer can be quicky determined with direction finding technology. Then just fly to the source instead. If they turn off the Jammer, then manual control is re-established and the jammer can be taken out normally.
I saw a video of them making a fking drone from sticks 😂😂😂
getting people fired up to spend their tax money on the future of unaccountable warfare, where thr vast majority of casualties will almost certainly be civilians and children. Disgusting.
Ukraine is done.
I hope that humanity one day will have learned not to wage ware against eachother.. That is what I hope. So we do not need to develop war drones....
Hostile killer drone in your area
Yeah, cheap drones. A LOT of them!
Seeing Portugal in this video wasn’t in my bingo card.   Anyway, great piece!
The video of the Ukrainian soldier showing mercy on a Russian soldier wanting to surrender..... Never seen something like that or thought I would in my life  time!
To bad they will lose.
War is just some boys playing with their toys.
🇷🇺👍🇮🇳  🇮🇳🇷🇺👍🇮🇳🇷🇺👍🇮🇳🇷🇺👍🇮🇳🇷🇺👍👍✅💪💪
Whatever ukraine has, russia has more.
Что на счёт Югославии пидр?
The thumbnail is clearly aimed at generated
Well people on the other side are still people and it’s weird to praise ones for killing the others
Russia hyperfans from indo: 😠😠😡😡🤬🤬
15:05, love that patch!
Ukraine is long divided between a few countries, so it’s nonsense to consider Ukraine a fighter, it’s a country of self-destroyer. Whatever both Russia and the US were bombarding it financially they preferred not to get developed but chose degradation and decay☺️
Hi Johnny🙂  Been following you since  Borders on Vox. I have a suggestion for a future video. Ukraine has become a new symbol of resistance and fight for democratic values. Other symbol for this is punk music (art in general). I’d love to see a bit about Ukraine’s punk music scene post-invasion. I promise you will be impressed. Like “Death Grips in church” impressed😀  I am from Ukraine, if that matters
The drones from Command and Conquer Generals are becoming a reality.
Yeah it works in the other way too, except Russian cost-efficiency is way better since Western tanks cost around 10M.
Almost all civilian drones on the battlefield come from China, and it is hard to imagine how terrifying China's drone production capacity during wartime would be
I see where this is going: AI drones fed images of potential targets and released in swarms like an artillery barrage.
The propaganda of war is the biggest crime....
After this war, hopefully a Ukrainian company specializing in commercial drones will pop up to compete with the Chinese brands in the market.
We're closer and closer to Animatrix' Second Renaissance.
It saddens me is the fact that we keep finding new ways to continue making war more technical rather than looking for ways to avoid war in the first place. I may not be directly involved in any of the wars around the planet, but I feel the impact from them. I feel how it is killing the planet and our species if we continue. It is only a matter of time before we extinct our species because we are so content in trying to control each other. Who can create bigger and better weapons? It's a pissing contest. The problem is that it doesn't just affect those who engage in the war, but also those who want nothing to do with it. I'm also thinking of all the animals killed because of our conflicts just because they happen to be in the wrong place and die without understanding what is going on. Life is already a struggle for most people and many animals. We don't need to make it more so. There has to be a way to resolve conflicts before they turn into conflicts. Until humans stop being so arrogant and cruel and learn how to be as civil as we claim to be, we will never have any kind of peace in the world.
How do I get Incogni to get my data off their list?
Might sound good, but Russia never gained air superiority. Which is surprising given the size of Ukraines Air Force.
I love the inventiveness of the Ukrainians. I am nearly 90 and it reminds me of the inventiveness of the British in WWII. I was  child and I remember the ingenuity of people to make do and mend. After the war I heard of numerous things we did to fool our enemy such as escape plans for those POWs incarcerated in Germany.
We can expect palestinian drones then
Please support Ukraine🙏
Nice
love your channel, but do someting wit the background music.. does my head in, way too loud
Whatever happened to balanced journalism. This is pure propaganda, very thinly veiled.
Hey Johnny I suggest you add a decent Arabic translation to your videos. You’ll have a lot more views 😉
Thank you for covering this. 🇺🇦
Ukraine said they increased drone production 100 times which is mind boggling but with so many smart tech students it seems feasible to me.
15:05 There is something extremely savage about that Angry Birds patch on a drone pilot :D
Johnny, I'm a huge fan of you. Great video, as usual. It’s great to see your videos on the Russia-Ukraine war. Can you please make more such videos on the Israel-Palestine war as well? We want to know about the allegations of genocide against Israel and the systematic bombing of civilians. Please create more content on this.
Hey Johnny, did you donate to support Ukrainian drone production?
I’m so confused, wasn’t this already a thing in COD? They just stole the idea from Call of Duty
What about Palestine ?? MR Harris
Necessity is the mother of all invention we grew up w/ Deus Ex games & future cyber soldiers & now it’s here Bcuz of Ukrainians. It’s truly inspiring & hopeful
Drone pilots are the new MVP of the war they can kill/injured more soldiers than a sniper.
Will you help for Ukraine or only gonna talk about it?
Imma say they are gonna go a lot more into drones that find targets themselves after being locked in. Like yamming and boosting only goes so far. At some point the drones will have to do the stuff themselves. And then there are gonna be accidents involving cililians. Oh man
If people build drones at home, they shouldnt be surprised if russia begins to target civilians. You aren't a civilian anymore if you are directly helping war effords, and in that moment you become a soldier that isnt wearing uniform. Which gives them any right to kill you even if you surrender.  It's unclean war. Like if you are doing that at unis, you are risking the lives of all actual civilians, because the uni is becoming a target
Expensive warhead . Why not make there own shaped charge
Very informative
16:59 Imagine a Palestinian said smth like this about their occupier
Thank you for the support and another great video from a proud Ukrainian 🇺🇦
It be great if the Government's could educate themselves?  on learning PEACE ? because they already do a great Job on starting WARS always of course against the Will of their people
Where do I even start... 1. The war didn't start in 2022, russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. 2. russia didn't achieve air superiority. 3. It's Kyiv, not Kiev  Please, do better.
Thanks!
Fake video, lopovi
GOOGLE is the single reason for all this span.....stop using GOOGLE...not used GOOGLE since 2015 and dont get any spam...
Ukraine will lose. No doubt about it.
Go Russia.
Imagine riding in the back of a convoy truck and you hear ennnnn 😅
It might be more effective to arm these drones with the sub munitions found in sensor fused weapons like the "Bonus" 155mm anti tank rounds or U.S. CBU 105 sensor fused sub munitions. The drone wouldn't need to hover above the tank to hit it. All it would need to do is get close and release the sensor fused munition and let it find the tank and destroy it on its own.   The larger BabaYaga sized drones could also be armed with the 15 kg APKWS II 70mm laser guided rockets, like the ones found on the anti drone "Vampire" systems, and used for a variety of targets. They could even be used to hunt and destroy KA 52 helicopters. One drone could be used for targeting almost anything with its laser, while several others act as launchers for the rockets. It would in effect be a flying Vampire system with a huge increase in range.  While Ukrainians are making serious inroads into what is possible with a drone. They are only scratching the surface of what can be accomplished on the battlefield with small and miniature unmanned systems.
No doubt some group is building kamikaze drones  which specifically hone in on and target  Russian signal jamming transmitters.
I am starting to doubt your journalistic integrity given the recent events that are happenning in Gaza and the west bank. All I saw from you was a measily short video explaining it from Isreal's point of view and no mention of the palestinian people's plite for survival. Your silence is loud and no one is really interested in how cricket came to be or your new channel. How about some actually facts about current ongoing conflicts, where your reporting may actually make a difference.
great video, thank you Johnny
saw few friends in video. thanks for your work)
Well, there is a lot of work done to make this grassroot initiative "legal" and also - transform it into new and generation weaponry
By all the tech talk one should not forget that on both sides are humans. There is a young generation send to the slaughter on both sides. I would assume that the young Ukrainian drone builders likewise to the young Russian soldiers would prefer to continue their civil studies or work instead of dying for a concept or idea that the 50+ agers in their country have. It is not about that Russia started the war, we all know this, but about the young generation that suffers on both sides and will be affected their whole lives, regardless of the outcome of this war.
Palestinians too are showing us how serious they are defending their country from the occupiers by innovating and building their own weapons
Ukraine is winning?
Hey Johnny, do you know when your Incogni promo code ends? Hoping to gift it to someone for X-Mas 😊
I work with a guy who builds these and sends them overseas to Italy, then they're shipped to the Ukraine.
You really can't hear anything over that rediculously loud music at the beginning.
Hope someone starts donating Thermal Camera's and Nightvision WDR Camera's for their Drones
Wow at 20 years and he manufacturing missile guided systems and explosives in his backyard....This is really the future of Air Warfare and a huge Drone Market Gap, at first i thought this tactic was toying around against Russian artillery until NOW understanding the effectiveness of their counter offensives. #GrassRoots Innovation addressing an expensive Sector  vs CBM Missiles
I will literally never buy any product I see on a youtube video, and in video I skip it, will never care about them or even watch them
it would be cool if , when a drone encounters EW that it would switch control to following the ew signal and destroy the antenna.
Anyway, your interruption in slav country will be ruined by Russia, go away from Ukraine, your drones are nothing.
It is a great chance to ask your audiences for donations to buy or build more drones for Ukraine. What didn't you do that ?
Also I back traced it
Semi autonomous drone will be the next big thing.
Ahhh another war funded by US tax dollars
For us ignorant people FPV means "first person view". If that was said in the video I missed it.Thanks!
Glad the military didnt see the drones we made back in uni
Lol - isn't the war over?
🇺🇸
Absolutely outstanding video. Slava Ukraini!
Fuerza Ucrania!
I want to watch good content without hearing about your sponsors. Since i wont  settling for mediocre content i wont bother with this channel anymore
Johnny, when you gonna do a video on William cooper.
what a astory not that the palestinian resistance is doing as such and even building sniper rifles from scratch while under siege from the two most evil and terrorist states in the world and have no access to anything . still you call the Ukrainians who are getting billions in aid and experts the resistance while calling the palestinians terrorists. maybe it is because they are european . so it is like this if the fighters are europeans they are heros and freedom fighters . if arabs or any ethnicity the US and Europe see as inferiors then they are terrorists and how dare them stand in the way of the white man. btw the ruling and upper class in israel are all european and the rest of the jews are second class except for Ethiopians who are a third or even a fourth class citizens
russian is now making 2K fpv drones a day. Right now usually ukranian solders survive less than 1 week if they are less than 2km from front line. Thats real. Russia is pronting fpv drones and use them even more than artelery. russian fpv manifacturing is oustanding - they even use AI to recognise targets rigth now - drone may not have signal but it can recognise a tank or solder and attack it. thats is all making for example all US arsenal obsolute. why do you need these 5k abrams if russia can kill half of it in a week?
I'm a drone engineer and I'm headed to Ukraine to help. Thank you for covering this.
Although it’s necessary, I still find it sad that this technology is being used to kill other human beings.
05:45 "this is where war becomes almost scary"... almost?!? And only there?
These looked like a Charity Ad, the only thing that was missing was: Grab your parent credit card and send the 16 digits on the front, the expiration and CVV, and send it to Volodymyr.
Dear Harris, pls cover similar for Palestine
Dear Harris, pls cover similar for Palestine
In the video, Harris took a comment from Lyubchenko, Denis Lyubchenko, a deputy of the Kyiv City Council, an assistant to the People's Deputy of the Ukrainian Parliament, Artur Gerasimov, who was convicted of corruption and had the Russian terrorist Bezlier as his security chief.
I feel like this video got suppressed. I swear I didn’t see this in my feed
Now in Ukraine, dictator Zelenskyi and his henchmen are embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars in tenders for the production of drones. That is, the topic of drones in Ukraine now is a big corruption, and the money that comes from the USA and the EU is embezzled.
this is scary tbh if those drones tech like Ukraine had right now they will go somewhere after this war... if ISIS or any bad group learned how to do or use the same well we're fck ... us all civilians are fck for real it's fcking cheap and just there's a ton of videos online about coding and raspberry and arduino is there also... the point that Government has no control at this drone system at Ukraine is not very patriotic or to be proud off, it is a new danger coming ahead who knows airplanes was the same before from army only to commercial then 9/11 happens and become more strict .... I hope government do something about drones before a fckg 9/11 kind of happening before having to be strict of this abomination
showing the losing side? might wanna show how russia has better drones
Find ir make transmitters and recievers that run in the same frequency as Russian comms equipment. It will set them back 6 months of jamming drone signals.
if iraquis had the same stuff defending theirs
It kinda bothers me how much you change the title and clip art of posted videos. 😅
One thing i’ve wondered for years is what this means for terror*sm. What happens when extremists decide to use such accesible tools to say drop a bomb in the middle of a crowd?
As a Ukrainian, I’m grateful for you spreading the word about it in the North America. Would really help if you could post a donation link to collect some funds in support of Ukraine. I’d be happy to further direct you to some well-known Ukrainian volunteers that can put the money into a tangible benefit for Ukrainian army. Thank you.
basically COD AW is coming up and that IS NOT GOOD
Just got my first drone and maiden flight today 12/5/23.  …one of them - why’d I take so long to get one?  I’m truly fascinated by all the possibilities.
Russians will try to put short range signal jamers on everything. The next step in this drone development is automatic target engagement. When a pilot sees a target and if the signal gets lost after target is marked the autopilot takes over and automatically engages a target. After they will introduce automatic target recognition and lock on. Then it will become a war of autonomous specialized drones hunting humans and then other drones in the air on land and at sea. Not in a 100 years, but in 5 at the latest.

China hates nazis let's applaud for mother Russia
It is deeply saddening to me seeing the coverage bias of this so called “independent” journalism channel, one that I used to actually respect and rely on. When covering the Russian-Ukranian conflict, the Ukranians — the attacked minority — are always portrayed as nationalistic heroes, fighting honorably to defend their homeland. Yet, when covering the Isr@el-H@mas conflict, H@mas — also representing an invaded minority, with a history much bloodier and more savage than that of Ukraine — is portrayed as a terrorist organization committing “violent atrocities”. This video in particular, essentially highlighting this new type of warfare, should have been about the usage of such DIY drones everywhere, especially in the fight for G@za. Resistance groups in G@za have been using such drones as well, in attempts to mildly balance the aerial power dynamics in this war, and destroy Isr@eli targets that, along with tens of highly advanced fighter jets, continue the constant shelling of civilians — women and children in their majority.  The problem is undoubtedly much bigger than this specific video — starting with this channel’s recent video that covers the G@za conflict in a biased, uneducated manner — but as I watched this video, I found it remarkable how deep the western propaganda —attached to this war in particular and to all levels of the global narrative in general — has been imprinted within the minds of the masses, not the least ones who consider themselves “independent” and “progressive”, and actually believe they are.
You said insurance premiums are raised based on browsing history. Do a story on that.
Incogni actually works i had them for 2 months and my Daily Spam emails and falls completly stopped 🤩👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Their drones after hitting the target are probably still in better condition then most of my fpv stuff
We know from whom people are suffering.
I helped with this name title by voting for it and completely forgot. When I saw “Drone labs”  I immediately clicked it!! It worked!!
Putin Liked this.
Дякую за відео. Але проблема полягає в тому що саме українці (прості солдати та волонтери) придумали їх застосовувати, але росіяни перехопили ініціативу на державному рівні. Нажаль Українське керівництво не маштабує це дієве та дешеве рішення. Партнери теж не беруться тут допомагати. Вони воліють зробити одну ракету за умовно мільйон доларів замість 2000 дешевих дронів. Нажаль війна в Ураїні стала способом заробітку для великих західних виробників зброї. Для них це гроші, а для нас українців це ЖИТТЯ. Гроші можна заробити завжди, а життя не повернеш ніколи. Моя дитина втратила дитинство ( спершу ковід, потім війна, яка невідомо коли закінчиться), може втратити і батьків чи навіть власне життя, а там хтось рахує гроші. Колись я любив дивитися голівудські бойовики, які показували крутих спеців військових. А тепер мене верне від цього бо розумію що специ в нас в окопах, на заході просто граються в командос. Якщо ви такі круті знищіть цих гадів!!! Дайте пожити нам!  P.s.  Це просто крик душі людини, що хоче жити в своїй країні.
Throwing in a commercial about spam In the middle of a conversation like this is inappropriate. I understand necessary respect for Ukraine, and do it at the beginning or the end and let their story be told
USA Gov through tax payers seems to pay for all wars around the world. Contractors run US armed forces.
Brought to you by 3 letter agencies
That's why many important prisons are installing jammers!
It reminds me of Call of Duty Black Ops II, 2025 drones attack on Los Angeles
Please make a video on Venezuela
It is amazing how ingenious we are as a species when it comes to killing each other.
Great job, Ukrainian people! We are supporting your efforts, love from Romania ❤
The main thing I’m fearing is how this is going to used for terrorism, domestic or otherwise.
everyone's for sale now lmao..sold there souls to a advertising co that expects you to do the ad work for them and you comply for pennies lmao
trouble with your sponsor "incogni" is there nothing to say you didnt just give them acess to stop the data colection and sell it themself...i wouldnt pay for such trash
This been happening in video games for ages now. Never thought I would actually see it being used in real life. This is scary.
Some Russian dude in his cold ass basement is inventing a remote controller that can hack drones
One way to limit jamming of signal  is too use copper foil on bottom and side of electrics
Thank you
These DIY drones are also being used in the war in sudan. Although their destructive power is limited due to weak munitions.
investigating wrong kind of labs in Ukraine, bro 😉
If it is a quiet revolution perhaps you could cut the noisy and intrusive background music.
Go johnson !
Commenting for algorithm. Every democracy and freedom loving persons should see this.
ukranians showing footage of attacks : to boost moral Palestinians doing the same : ooh terrorism look at thsoe bad guys
Civilians producing weaponised drones are no longer civilians, they're legitimate strategic targets.
I hope these civilians realise that they are making themselves and the locations that they work legitimately military targets.  Stay away from schools and hospitals unlike hezbollah
Johnny, you mispelled incogni in the link you provided.
As an FPV pilot and drone designer myself - definitely shocked to see this become a reality 😢
These drones are using a dedicated frequency band use for RC airplanes - thus easily detected and jammed because everyone knows the hobby frequencies.  I wonder when someone will start using WiFi, which uses a spread spectrum frequency hopping technology to get data through what could normally be a very noisy radio environment in households.  WiFi is very difficult to detect due to the super fast frequency hopping pseudo-random algorithm, added to the fact the signal is spread out, and thus very hard to detect and jam.  Their combat drones would be a lot more effective that way - somebody must know this out there!
This war could’ve been over just weeks after it started but Joe Biden told Zelenskyy to not agree to what is likely what will happen anyway; Russia maintaining control over Crimea and then gaining some Eastern territory which voted to join Russia anyway. But nah hundreds of thousands dead because “Russia Bad”
Extra smart of them to show themselves😂
Volodymyr Zelenskyy bought a few brand new multi million dollar yachts!  I’m sure he could’ve bought some drones for his people. Biden is laundering billions into Ukraine and Zelenskyy is getting a massive cut! I’m sorry but I can’t support a country that the USA is doing gross corruption on a level never seen before.
Ukrainian reporter sounds Australian
as an FPV hobbiest, i dont mind drone being used as war weapon. But, please, source it directly from the producer, not market place. :( We need drone parts also.  For US, imagine 2 years from now, US army come out with drone that has capabilites like DJI Avata but for war stuff. Its Crazy.
Don't talk that you're doing journalism in 18:27. It's almost two months, and yeah you still blindside about this. Meanwhile when talking about RUsso-UKro, you looks so excited about it, and still makes video about it, even the civillian casualties are just 10.000-dth, 500 of them are children. But in case of PLS, the civillian casualities are unbelievable over 15.500-dth, and over 5000 of them are children. You see this, comparison? This is just 1 month 3 weeks vs 1 year 9 month, and yeah, you prefer to hear UA voices. Just becase your colleagues are one of them, you don't wanted to talk about it. Don't act like you're not picking side just because you talking about negative side of your country history.
InnovationThrough necessity
Johnny Cliché Harris
how about a kamikaze drone to take out radio jamming instruments. Obviously, the jamming device provides the strongest signal to guide the drone straight to the source?
Tutorial?
After thus war Ukraine can easily become one ifbthe world's largest manufacturer
I remember watching a YT short about a company developing Hunter Killer drones that would be able to essentially fly up to someone's forehead and detonate, killing them instantly. Crazy how that's becoming a very tangible reality.
Now this is what I call smekalka.
This is far from "unprecedented territory" the US saw this coming 10-15 yrs ago, thats why they cracked down on drones so hard and got the faa involved for enforcement. Additionally, quadcopters were used for artillery attacks several times in south america nearly a decade ago, most notably on a politicial speech.
Cheering for the people in UKRAINE fighting for their freedom, treating their heroes like legends. But when the Palestinians fighters do the same, you call them terror*sts?. Seriously?   That's just plain hypocritical.
Russia bought Germany Krauss Maffei Wegman Military Tank Leopard or Puma JT23 which it can detect attack Drones
Give it Ai + Give it a gun = End of humanity.
You're really trying, eh?
Come to Poland to see what Ukrainians do here
Why the constant mention of THEY, when everyone knows that without the USA and NATO, all of this would not have worked. . . And as long as THEY continue to do that, more and more Ukrainians and Russians will die, which leads to a bigger problem. . .
Johnny, you or your staff wrote the sponsor's link wrong in description, correct it !
Imagine if this engineering and skills were used for something productive than warfare and murder 🙄🙄😒😒
how does this guy do this much research into ukraine but still cant pronounce their capital right. Like it isnt hard man. Київ. The K is just a K. и, would be like the "ee" sound. the ї is "yi" and the в is a v. So put it all together, and you get "K-ee-yi-v". Not "Keev". Pronounced basically the exact same as the russian spelling of it, its only subtly different.
Palestinians doing this would be labeled terrorists and rapists wouldn't they?
This guy is not Ukranian
F۰۰۰۰ Zelensky
Why do you guys always report on one side ???? Anyways even if America and all the EU countries bring their drones on the battle Field nothing would change and the results would be the ones we seeing now
have ads like jaegers not been made yet? if not i know what ima do. make it and sell it to countries 🤑
How about a story on UKR Nazis ???
Feels wrong using these drones in warfare. Makes death so random, so impersonal, so normalized, almost guilt-free. Russians, or Ukrainians, lives should not be ended in this manner.
Thanks!
Johnny Harris just adds more to the sad depressed world out there. He has to make you realize its even worse. Classic liberal, cant enjoy anything, must point out anything they feel isn't perfect.
Johnny Harris, a channel for people that are afraid of literally everything. This channel is pure fearmongering.
I so hope you will drop the "music" from the background.  It is very distracting and also boring.
I interrupt the reporting of the war with Russia to talk to you about spam.
Great completely unbiased news complete truth
New thumbnail every couple mins
If Palestinians were doing that they would have been labelled as terr0r!sts   Too much hypocrisy 😢😢
I think the algorithm is suppressing this video- I didn't see it in my subs, and it seems overall it has way less views than a usual JH release
About your sponsor - Incogni is pretty indiscriminate. I'm a small business owner, and we don't have a mailing list and don't send out any unsolicited messages, just order confirmations and shipping updates, and we NEVER share data. Yet we'll still get messages from the likes of Incogni demanding the deletion of data, and all we can do to comply is to delete the account completely. That may not be what the user wants but they give us no way to find out and we don't have the time to deal with it. So I guess don't be surprised if you find you can't access your order history anymore.
Okay you come from vox, that’s why : the voice, the music, animation, and the feeling is kind of a vox video.
FPV drones and their mass production for just a war - is a bad for himanity on all planet. We must ban that type of devices to be used. This is not fair, this is not scientific, this is fucked up. It's kinda nuclear bombs, but much more bad, it is a living tragedy.
Glory to Ukraine. Thanks for all the support coming from us taxpayers and government.
This has been around for ever. When country A tries to take over/destroy country B and the population of the country B really doesn't want country A there or hates country A, this is what you get. It's called "guerrilla warfare". Drones that can be quite easily and cheaply made or partially 3D printed at home are just a natural progression of the old school guerrilla warfare resistance tactics. Like ambushes, pipe bombs, molotov cocktails etc.  "The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue."
Should of blurred the faces of these makers
Geez how many times do you need to change the title and thumbnail?
Gorgeous content as always!
Smart guy's but not smart enough to see who's using them and sacrificing their nation and soldiers to fight Putin.   This is just america using the Ukrainian nation to fight a war for heim because they're too much cowards to do it themselves. Or smart not using their own soldiers. The establishment did EVERYTHING to push Putin into invading Ukraine
I just got into freestyle FPV a couple years ago, and it's the first thing that I have in my life that I can consider a real hobby. It has brought me so much joy, and has made major contributions to my mental health. Although I'm sure I would be doing the same thing in their shoes, I have torn feelings seeing something that has, in my own personal life, been such a positive and life afferming force be used in such a way, and I hate how it affects my hobby.
It's called a mesh.
Yeah, except your country is too corrupt to even do this war correctly so this shit was never going to work out for them.
This form of warfare has been used in syria, libya, iraq, etc. Ukraine didn't start it
Why do people think that only they can think and the people who they cheerlead?
Johnny, very informative, but was it worth it to you to show their faces and put out their real names.  You have made them targets.  Your story would have been just as good, but now you have put them and their families in harm's way.  Think about that a you go to sleep tonight.  Was it worth it to you?
It kinda sucks that stuff like this gets weaponised. Oh you want to buy a new Ethix Mambo controller for chistmas for your hobby you desperatly need to get your head of the world as it is at the moment? Shame that it's used to kill people in the near east, and sold out for months at a time... Vote me down or hate comment on this if you need to state the fact that I'm a spoiled kid in europe or something, but it's just a fact that the world revolves day by day for everyone on here and people who do not want to get sucked into all that deafening war propaganda stuff are shunned because we're "arrogant and soulles cause we don't care" I do care but, I just can't handle to hear of death, slaughter and all the bad stuff happening all the time so give me some slack here. Also the terms like "futuristic goggles, man those are just some tiny ass screens slapped into a housing with a digital or analog RX don't make up stories about how absolutely mind boggling that technology is.
As well russia had a drone postal service which failed so spectacularly. The drone malfunctioned and collided with a wall on the first day of service.
To see engineering students making war weapons, it saddens my heart. In another time they would have used it to better people's life with their skills not kill people. War is worst thing that could have happened.
STOP CHANGING TITLE AND THUMBNAIL BRO ITS ENOUGH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
‘These drones became the edge the Ukraine needed to level the playing field in the sky’.  Bro… I understand you’re a staunch advocate for ‘Big Drone’, but hocking weaponised hyperbole just makes the whole enterprise sound like an infomercial.  Also, where might an amateur, drone enthusiast/patriot acquire ‘just the warhead’ for a chopper based missile?  What about all the practical questions  & considerations which really need to be addressed before endorsing DIY weapons systems as a cost effective means of imparting some lethality upon the rampaging Slavs/Huns/Chinese/Aunt Bunnie.
Your statement about DJI not wanting its drones to be used for war and especially for Ukraine  - is unfair to DJI. Which civilian company want their product to be used for killing? It was Ukraine’s strategy to use cheap drone such as DJI as weapons so there is nothing wrong for DJI to object. Wouldn’t you object? Never the less at one point reports said Ukraine buying 60% of all mavric production. DJI doesn’t want to sell their product to anyone including Russians who wants to use it for war. What’s the problem with that? But your tone is as usual typical anti China as if China can do nothing right. What sht attitude and I am saying this as a person NOT from China nor a supporter just a fair observer of what’s going on. You want weapons get them from nato from uSa don’t drag a civilian company into your politics and rubbish just because DJI does not want to be involved in killing people that you have no problem killing.
2:49 There is a slight error here. FPV kamikaze drones, as the ones depicted and described in the shots before, usually do not have a "release button", as they get destroyed during the mission either by hitting the target or crashing beforehand. This gets cleared up later but you even show a RC remote when describing the "release button", which gives off a wrong impression.
Back before I dropped out of college, I wrote a paper on the benefits of low cost DIY drones for underfunded search and rescue teams, including a step by step assembly manual for a €185 drone with a 2kg payload capacity, and then put in a full page outlining alternate uses, with this being one of them.

How is this different than Palestine defending themselves from invasion 🤔
yet with Dron3s UKR will never win this war, they need proper weapons to win ...
" So If white people make drones against invasion " its Freedom fighters" but if Palestinians do this it would be "Terrorism"  Lmfao
Amazing stuff
thank you, Johnny for uncovering such an interesting topic and supporting Ukraine, your work means a lot!
Cool. Very relevant coverage.  Can you do one on the Phillipines struggle to maintain their sovereignty in the south pacific?  Or Guyana and and it's strategic  role in caricom? Thanks.  -DB
I struggle in circles with the ethics of this and I pass zero judgement.    Just for anyone watching, FPV is a beautiful, rewarding, art form of a hobby.  Fulled with brilliant innovators and engineers.  MultiGP probably has the most direct connection to this community.
very nice
The real bevtoveen and mozart and sebastian bach of the smart drones love this video
I'm reminded of the movie called *_"Angel Has Fallen"_* staring Gerard Butler where they used swarms of small explosive drones all run by AI to attack the US president.  I have zero doubt that there are real versions of that in operation today.  Wouldn't surprise me one bit if a certain presidential candidate is in extreme danger of such an attack, that will of course be blamed on foreign terrorists instead of the domestic terrorists that actually did it.  Hopefully that remains a conspiracy theory that never happens!!!  🙄
The only one winning the drone battle in this war is RUSSIA 🇷🇺
No doubt the GRU appreciated the names and images of these guys.  Good job Johnny you put finer crosshairs on them.
While I like seeing their faces, I wish they were blurred. These people are important. On the unfortunate flip side of this, they are changing their tactics, and terrorists may duplicate it in the future. With people able to build their own, no free government can effectively prevent people from doing the same. Watching how quick technology has changed the world in my lifetime has been wild. The internet, wireless communication, reusable rockets, I guess AI is the next big milestone.
The last part is really sad. Such a smart engineer talking about killing within generations.
Doesn't this video make these drones makers a target for Russians intelligence ?
The. Fpv suicide drones are terrifying....   Saw a Russian soldier being chased around a metal cart loke a merry go round  then boom right on his head...😮 While the drone operater laughing (fair enough was just a bit mental to watch)   Wtf do you do?  Net gun?
Every time i see that guy installing the propeller using a pair of pliers I cringe....
The same goes with sea kamikaze drones, it took one or two years to sink 11 Russian ships (not sure, check sources, maybe the total is smaller because of storm shadow instead of sea drones) and the main point is that Ukraine has mostly next to none of a navy. this alone for something like the USA and NATO is gonna secure an unstoppable navy, but also this dangers the cost of needing a navy if more and more countries get a hold of sea drones. in short, what is known is that war increases innovation in the long term, stuff like the first aid med kit, aviation, encryption, and so much more. If focusing on drones, cheap, easy-to-produce drones with a payload, even the idea to use drones for signal boosting, who knows how this will affect technology and life later, but I can say with confidence that drones have a part in the future. cuz I remember a few years back having a drone was like a gimic, for photography and sport, now it is signal boosting, and weighted item transfer, hell, add AI into this and suddenly automation with little human input will make drones consumable on a massive spectrum of tasks and ideas - apart from no-fly zone restrictions. Amazon is already going crazy with it, the next minute we will see delivery to your 10-story apartment window. drone patrol for police like in sci-fi games (cyberpunk, bioshock?). flying internet coverage tower replacement for rural areas when a tower is too expensive and you are moving around, who knows maybe it will find a connection from far away towers and pass on to you. what ever it is, all ideas already exsist, its just this warr might help it addvance.
Why do the thumbnails keep changing on some of your vids?
Hi! Please do not misunderstand me, I do not mind it, but It does not sound realistic that a country that was poor even before the war now its people have enough money to donate to those drones. And if I look around my network, the only ones who follows the Ukrainian news are who has family on the front; I do not think the funds can come from western civilians. Also, showing faces and talking about classrooms... Please reassure us those guys in the video are actors and not the real guys.
It’s hard to tell, but some of these drone assemblers look like they’re operating from apartments or dwellings that resemble standard commercial buildings. Not smart to show footage like this without blurring out those details as this makes them military targets. Even though it seems impossible to me to tell exactly where they are 🤷‍♂️
Imagine these things with computer vision, capable of detecting and destroying targets on their own
My email is not a mess now stop projecting your problems on to me
Sorry, but doesn’t reporting that drones are made in homes and schools sort of hurt the claims that Russia is committing war crimes? Doesn’t manufacturing weapons somewhere make it a legitimate target?
This is less of an issue for wealthy militaries, you have Directed Energy (DEW) Microwave Impulse/Laser etc, Electronic Warfare (EW) and Hardkill systems like Remote Weapon Stations and even anti-drone drones. I imagine this is much like the invention of indirect fire artillery and tanks. Initially there are no real countermeasures but then the way of fighting adapts, they get incorporated in and then things become fluid again
The amount of ads on this video is insane.
As a FAA certified commercial drone pilot (Part 107), with my family coming from the Ukraine (Odessa), I am so thrilled about this video and the amazing application of drone technology by the Ukrainians to defend their country.  Most innovation happens during times of need and in crisis, and I wouldn't be surprised that, after the war, some Ukrainian drone manufacturer will be serious competition for DJI's superiority in drone technology.  It's fascinating to witnessing that process!
One way around ECM (electronic counter measures) would be to use AI. So you designate a target ASAP, and if you lose contact with the drone, it will still proceed to its target. This is even easier for recon because all the drone needs to do is loiter over the target and transmit back to the launch site. ECM can block the drone from receiving data, but not from sending it.
This is not a good thing.  I fully expect drone attacks in the US.  I'm surprised we haven't already.
John Harries next time add your face in the thumbnail, it will attract more views,... The thumbnail of this video is very unlike ur regular thumbnails, this might reduce views
With all my respect and support from the US. Slava Ukraine !
Paid sponsors even though I have youtube red is like spam.
I'm incredibly torn about this. It could be me.  I'm a British mecatronic engineering student exactly the same age as Mykyta. I started building, flying, modifying and developing fpv drones 7 years ago at the age of 13. It's been by far the best hobby I've been a part of, it's consumed my life and my almost every thought: I can design and implement precisely the right craft for each mission, build it, and fly with over 1500 hours of experience at the sticks. In short, I can pull off every step of the process myself. These beautiful birds, the tools, software and equipment around them were developed by excited enthusiasts in their time off around the world, almost always "open source" (=editable so anyone can modify/contribute). These drones grew out of passion for the pure bliss of flight, the feeling is the most addictive adrenaline rush I know of.  I'm in no way surprised by how effective they are on the battlefield, as a community we all knew someone would notice eventually and that this would happen...  And yet seeing them become weapons of mass destruction and a symbol of fear shakes me to the core. Christian values mean a lot to me, and the idea of me killing someone in my current environment in unthinkable.  However, what would I do here? Although nothing is purely black and white, this war sure does seem like good vs evil: a noble cause for the protection of their home, and the survival of what otherwise would be a peaceful nation. The Ukrainian lives saved by this technology are without a doubt proportional to the price Russia is paying in blood.  As you say repeatedly, this changes warfare for ever, and hobby flight worldwide will see extremely firm restrictions and regulations put in place, and as much as that saddens me, you can't blame resourcefulness in their desperation with so much at steak.  I fear for the future of this civilisation, which seems to me more uncertain than ever. At the speeds at which things spread nowadays it will end up catching us up and being used against us before we know it.  May God bless all who are out there on the battlefield at the moment, and their families.  This really is a turning point.
Thank you Johnny for ur great work!!!!!!
Billions and billions spent on fancy war equipment just to be challenged by a fun little toy you'd buy for your nephew.  Also the Pentagon asking for small businesses to come up with ideas is mind blowing to me. How much does our government give to weapons manufacturers/developers per year?
I think I've seen like 5 different titles for this video now. 😂
Palestinians using drones to kill IDF makes them terrorists.
Technology is a DUEL EDGE weapon, any advance can be countered or copied
"... a quiet revolution"?! Made me chuckle
Rebellions in Myanmar also using DIY drones to fight Military Junta.
this is crazy casue this is the new weapon that is going to be used inguerilla warfare & I LOVE IT
The more I hear about this the more I'm concerned about terrorism in the world, especially America. I mean explosives strapped to a Drone? Thats a huge threat
Well thats it for the hobby😢
Elrs 915mhz airport on a spare uart in the sky is a huge boon to signal reach
Ukraine is putting up a good fight, but I'm happy they are losing, because after a victory the 0.5% of Nazis would be in charge of the 99.5% of the population. Why? Because the US government decided to give them all the power, all the weapons and all the connections to the NATO intelligence services!
There are not many of us FPV pilots out there so many of us have been approached at one point or another regarding this subject.
I wanna build one now 😂
I hope same can be said for Palestinians That they don't get swallowed by their bigger neighbour
A quiet revolution is happening...really... Instead of focusing their knowledge on making weapons, they should focus on the real problem, which is Nazism in Ukraine with the current government at the helm. It definitely doesn't happen... Because those same ``students/Taliban'' belong to the same establishment... Evil begets evil... In the past it was the people of Bandera, a big penalty was paid for that, but this time the penalty is that will the Ukrainian nation go into the past not noisily but quietly... without anyone caring... for a reason. And those who introduce themselves with their first and last name, showing their faces... It tells how naive they are if they think that no one is following them and possibly killing them.
"Tinkerers who are repurposing their skills to resist invasions."  Look like you never opened a history book in your entire life. It is simply war economy doing what it does at its finest. They are making tools of war for profit, nothing more, nothing less.
All those other content creators were right about Johnny, what a disgusting sellout. You can't trust a single word this dude says and I'm upset I ever did.
Taiwan taking notes…
AI Drone Storms coming soon to a theater of war near you!  Skynet is watching.
Kind of one sided reporting.
with new gen NVDIA chips, I think in 2024 these drones will utilize computer vision, reasoning, and intelligent targeting
stop supporting the war. Trump 2024
Johnny Harris I think you should do a fund-raiser!! For Ukraine!! That would really help! 🇺🇦
Thank you for support and this video!!! SLAVA UKRAINI!
Bro changes title faster than me changing my clothes
Can’t fixate on a single title?
You portray their underground drone programme as heroic resistance. Why don't cover Hamas's underground drone programme the same way?
Yes, American is watching closely... All this life's lost. But they get too improved there army. Who would have thought
In today's world, the only protection one has is one's own brain.  One can buy into conspiracy theories.  One can pretend one can protect oneself against cyber attacks.  One tracking device lodged on one's phone or workstation already has worthwhile data to scam, spam and drown one in advertising.  The answer is to master one's own brain.  Learn what one needs.  Teach one's brain to block out the garbage.  Stop joining social media outfits like 'X', LinkedIn, et al.  Develop a hermit mindset.  It's okay to be alone.  It really is.  Find comfort in one's ability to live without accolades of adoration from people one will never know.    I believe you know this Johnny.  Therefore I subscribe to your network.
You should do a video on how affiliate marketing youtubers are destroying hobbies with dishonest journalism in order to ride an algorithm.
Ukranians doing this are freedom fighters and defenders of their land. Palestinians doing this would be called terrorism.
This is basically romanticizing war
I am amazed by your double standards. Ukrainians are freedom fighters while Hamas is a terrorist group.
Interesting video, however what I miss is the topic of counter measures and the perspective of soldiers in the field also being targeted by drones. Was that too controversial for you?
I feel so sorry for the Ukrainian public. Their leader is making huge mistakes and the amount of men dying is just disastrous. Zelensky needs to surrender and keep what he can of his country or they will lose more than they have already.
What I didn't like is that you exposed the tactics on how Ukrainians overcome the jamming from Russians... It is always better to stay silent about such things!
my man changed the title of this video like 4 times
Its only a matter of time before an AI able to make kill orders is deployed to get around the jamming.
The Battle of the Wifi Drones 😂
This channel has pretty much taken over everything that VOX and Vice News used to cover to some extent 10 years ago and done it better. Keep it up!
Ukraine and the Russian war has really changed the battle field
I hate that war is a reality when this amazing tech can but used for good
Video on Venezuela 🇻🇪 and Guyana 🇬🇾 please 🙏 bro😢😢
Oh nice Johnny is a sell out.
I love this breakdown. Johnny, you need to cover more about the war....
What if they don’t need radio at all, what is the drone was controlled by AI? The future is getting scary.
Here is the crazy part. If russia wins, this whole movement will be labbled as a terrorist movement.
I can barely hear u talking at the start of this vid
Thanks for this video.  We shuld not forget Ukraine.  ❤❤❤
So how does one get a contract to build drones? I've built all sorts of 5" and 6" FPV drones and would love to be paid for it lol
Wow the drone shit you took in Madeira is where I live, pretty cool bro
Johnny Harris , Thanks Much !.......
You shouldn't have shown their faces and names. They can be targeted by Russia wherever they are given their impact on the war.
War has never been the same. War is like a mountain, there's a tradtional way of getting up there, and there's a more morden way of getting up there. Either or, each step, will eventually tire out.
Palestinians  too needed a way to fight back against Israeli occupation , so they have  started to use  that  tactic of drone ,  the western media call them terrorists  and on the other hand they call Ukrainian freedom fighter
How can we support these small drone makers?
I'm so thrilled you hosted Naomi Wolf! She's much more attractive then on her Fox appearances
Open Source Hardware/Software FTW. But boo on crowdsourcing war.
Ghost Recon anybody 🫣
Thanks for sharing.
15:19 not unprecedented territory. This was already going on in Syria and The Second Nagorno-Karabakh War.
Chinese Drones are the best!
such a good video
Incogni technology should literally be implemented in the app in use. This is like the VPN bullshit, they should be protecting your privacy without buying a new product
13:42
JOHNNY THE LINK IS THE WRONG ONE YOU DID A TYPO!!
Anyone whos on telegram has seen how effective these are. Absolutely devastating.
We really need to ban drones in cities if it's that easy to attach explosives to them
Just when the battle hardened soldiers needed help most their greatest asset, The NERDS came in with their drones and said “We do indeed have an App for That!!”
Ive seen videos of drones that have 2 or 3 grenades that they can drop one at a time. Its gnarly.
What’s crazy is America is so worried about fighting other peoples wars while we’re borderless with countless terrorists crossing our borders everyday while the left avidly tries to disarm us….#AmericaFirst
For anyone wanting to support Ukraine - look for Come Back Alive foundation. Pretty efficient investment
I stand with Russia
Free Ukraine 🇺🇦 DONT MAKE US SEND S1MPLE
Love searchParty
Vox is trending lower than Johnny on videos uploaded on the same day
This video took to much to come out... this would have made sense months ago. The situation now is: Russia mastered the drone war and outproduced Ukraine, which in contrast has depleted their resources.  There is no winning there anymore...  also, it would be great if Johnny admitted himself to be part of the war propaganda as he points fingers at others
That Segway was so good I actually watched the sponsor segment.
around 16 31 you forgot to mention how the us is funding and weaponizing ukraine for this research
A glimpse of ww3
I still love how the media revels in the Ukrainian propaganda and fully supports it while refusing to even acknowledge the Russian side of the war. By no means am I supporting Russia, but I'm just saying that the narrative control we've been experiencing is getting tiring. Support Ukraine and all, but man let me something from the Russian side, maybe even some on the ground interviews with Russian troops if possible, like we do with the Ukrainians. I want to hear something other than "Yay Ukraine, Boo Russia" or "Support Ukraine, sanction Russia (then blowup the pipeline and buy back the same Russian oil but at a decreased price)".
And here I thought all the money to Ukraine was going to Zalenski's "yacht and other toys" account
I love your work as a journalist and i have watched your video for years. Maybe it would be better to put the word occupied between Russian and Territory when displaying the map in your video. As people seem to really care about that one word.
I recently mentioned to my family, some of the stories about Drones being used in Ukraine and how they've turned the tide of the war. Also, how the government knows this and they would probably attempt to get rid of all the FPV pilots in America before they trigger the war because they know that we would be the most dangerous threat to any opposing forces
The narrative/context of what the Ukrainians are experiencing sounds awfully familiar to what’s going on elsewhere in the world. Crazy to see how the script flips when the name of the country is simply swapped.
This should be free to users but, the senders of spam should be chaarged
That ending shot of the pilot in the stairwell invoked real cyberpunk dystopia vibe. Now with countries experimenting adding AI to drones to create an autonomous weapon, we're getting into real unexplored territories. I'm both excited and worried, what a time to be alive.
Good thing these guys are able and willing to defend their country. Just an observation, the war started long before Russia launched its first attack.
Yessss I finally got the map poster!!! It was sold out by the time I got to it both of the last rounds! 😂😢
So much respect for the Ukrainian people outside the war that are still working to help. I wish I could do something, I'm about as useless as it gets.
This isn't some insane new tech.  We have known it was heading this way for 20 years.
Russia won the war. THE END
does anyone know why the titles of his videos change so much? We are on the third title already for this one
This was so fascinating
Bro you have changed the title and thumbnail like 7 times
Ukraine has already lost dude, i hate to tell you this
Can anyone tell me who is the man in the statue on the Kiyv Independent journalist?
EMP and direct energy. Follow that trail... it's next Gen sir
This is going to change terrorism forever lol
This is an amazing report.  It shows what happens when human beings are motivated and committed to their country.
Smh we got drone warfare before gta 6
All lives are precious so in any situation the gospel is needed: "For God so loved the world that He gave his only Son that whosoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life." (John 3:16) God is just so because we broke his moral law by doing wrong against Him, ourselves and others, His punishment for sin is the death penalty. However He is also merciful which is why He gave Himself in human form (Jesus) to die for us, and take away our sins if we repent and believe in Him. If we do, our debt or bail is paid and we can go free. God is also merciful for those who have never heard the gospel and will judge them by their conscience, actions and belief in Him from evidence of creation.
"the more we kill now, the less our children will have to"..... that's a terrifying statement..... I would not want to be on the receiving end of that type of determination.
In the last part of this video- in Ukrainian land they are the defenders of their land. On the other hand, in another video couple of weeks ago by JH - Hamas is the terrorist by defending their own land which was stolen 70 years ago by Zionist movement. What a great instance of cognitive dehiscence. Bravo JH for splendid Independent Journalism
You are top tier Johnny.  Congrats on the success and cheers for more to come.  This was amazing to watch.
Good thing this video is only in english Russia won't know to target the booster drones or their home base.  The good news is that the DOD is going to spend $20k/per on $350 drones with $20 of explosives
Incogni is so nice. Works so well
I dont know if its messed up but I wish Americans had something to fight for.
H*m*S be taking notes.
This should give people enough understand of how BADLY Russia is winning   Random guys on the streets making DIY bombs? And people really think they are winning..? Or that the money is actually going to the people on the ground?
The fact that Ukrainian forces shared this is the worst part.  How many billion dollar militaries didnt think of this?  Drones, specifically cheap ones have been available for a long time.  Now any billion dollar army building tanks is going to build half a million drones for half the price to get operational.  Props for them using it, but once the secret is out the secret is everyone's to develop, build, and make worse.  At least Russia has sent all their great minds to die before they realized it.
Biden:  We got F16s! Me:  I got a wall full of drones.

How DIY Drones are Destroying Million-Dollar Tanks - old title
Scary to think what this could do in the hands of a terrorist, or a mass shooter
🫠
But many Leopard 2A got destroyed by single FPV drone. And they cost 5  times more than Russian tanks.
No gaza story?
The is a typo in the link for the incogni plan…
The heroes behind the scenes.
Affordable Chinese tech doing much better than expensive, high tech military hardware? years ago people would be laughing at that idea.
Привіт із Киргизії! Українці, рідні ви наші, тримаєтеся ми все вболіваємо за вас обіймаємо вас! Правильно сказала людина на відео - щоб русня не робила їм все одно пизда! ❤
Ukrainians fighting back are called resourceful and freedom fighters but hamas & palestinians doing the same thing are called terrorists and terrorist sympathizers. Goes to show the Johnny can't even do a video on all the brutalize that Isreal is doing to the palestinians because of sponsorships drying up.
If only we could figure out how to feed and house everyone?  Oh, wait, we could
Thanks for showing Ukrainians in nationalist t-shirts making assault weapons in schools. 9:47
Those independent drone engineers are exactly the same person as the IED bomb engineer in Afghanistan and Iraq
DJI are the apple of drones, and took everything they have from the RC community.
Wth… when and where did Russia get air superiority & better intelligence !? That s actually there failure to achieve that which a key factor of their losses…
I've been watching the world closely since it started, and the one thing I've learned about this war is that this war will change _everything_ about how war is fought in the future. Not since the invention of the firearm has there been such an invention of a technology that has had such a generational impact.  When you think about it, a drone that is cheaper than some handheld firearms is providing significantly better intelligence than anything in World War II, can destroy things worth many thousands of times more than itself, and has completely blindfolded military planners around the world. For example, the US lacks an anti-drone system like the Gepard, Tunguska, or Pantsir, while the Russians are built on a doctrine that has found themselves to be completely vulnerable to the asymmetric warfare that Ukrainian drones have provided.
It won't only change war... unfortunately... and for us drone operators, it will be always more difficult to fly, because people will always more and more freak out... rightfully. I'm tired of this world.
🇺🇦: Heros who defend their country   🇵🇸: terrorists  Welcome to the west👍
This is fascinating. Thank you for showing this point of view.

Midgardian kills a tank 12:01
Ukraine’s going to have an epic racing scene after the war. Everywhere else FPV racing is  dying
A bit biased this video . Russians have way more and better drones.
20k drone vs 9 million tank(if you know)
The war is lost, The US/NATO aka "Ukraine" is defeated... grow up guys.
This is actually bad news for Ukraine, now Russia have a cheaper way to continue their attacks, the irony of war...
I bit scary to think how hard this tech can be regulated and how easy it'll be to deploy something like this over civilians in a non-war context
haha, so you renamed it. Fair enough, your propandistic bias has been too ovious at this point so might tone it down a bit.
Yeah u do know that Russia produces 10x the amount they do right? Push for peace not glorifying a stupid war 😡
Is it just me or does he have an Australian accent?
You could’ve added information from the war in Palestine and how Hamas used these cheap drones to stun the Israeli iron wall on October the 7th and how they are actively using it right now. Also how Israel is countering this with the metal roofs on tanks and vehicles
so its acceptable for Ukraineians to make  drones but not for Palestinians ?The  unconscious bias os so obvious that even Stevie wonder would see it. This is Racism
Ukraine VS Russia: Drone META Israel VS Hamas: Tunnel META
If Ukrainian people do this to stop Russian occupation they are heroes but if the palestinians does the same to stop Illegal Israeli occupation then they are terrorists simply coz they ain't white.  This the hypocrite world we live in...
The day it can make a kill then return to reload that is what you need to develop.
To be fair, the US has been working on this tech prior to 2011 when they unveiled Switchblade 300 (anti-personnel) and Switchblade 600 (anti-tank/ship.) I will grant that the Switchblade 300's $6k price tag is quite a bit more than Ukraine's $400 drones, but those are also inflated by the Military-Industrial mark-up.
Man, it's really starting to feel like Johnny has an agenda. Does anyone have any idea if/why this would be? Why would he care if people see Ukraine as the 'underdog'? Like, at 11:14 it is like he is trying so hard to force us into emotionally siding with Ukraine. Is this just because he wants the most views and this is what us viewers want to hear? Or is there like a political/financial incentive for him too? (I guess having more views is a financial incentive ofc, but I mean an outside force)
Correct me if I'm wring.  So they rely on people who just doing volunteer works to support one of the most important part of war and not granting them monetary aid for their production?
To overcome the signal jamming Ukrainians are probably going to go for autonomous control, which may get scary.
as much as drone can use to defense, the tactics now can be adopted by the future terrorist activities. the military should be a step ahead and invest on this drone warfare squad so they not caught off guard of future terrorist plan that use a simple drone method to create destruction in grand scale.
Greetings,       As a 107 Drone Pilot I am glad they are finding ways to use this tech to help protect Ukraine from Russian Forces. I do understand especially the negative publicity DJI is getting from the US for example where the US is trying to ban DJI and claiming spy drones for China and they see how they are being used here as guided weapons.        I get why DJI wants nothing to do with this and is finding ways to keep their drones out of this war. I love my drones and the last thing I want to see is America disabling my DJI Drones just because they assume they are spy drones and they need to go. Which is ridiculous to say the least.        Now to see Ukraine using FPV drones that are just made, which get done here as well, it is hard for the US to ban all drones because there isn't any particular company responsible. I am very proud of Ukraine and all these people making these drones to protect their people and their great country from the Russian Invasion. (God Bless, Ukraine!)
This video demonstrates once again how a money black hole Ukraine really is. How comes that with all the money they have received, such a strategical production is left in the hands of volunteers and donors...
Surely with so many labs doing AI research, we can muster a primitive independent strike AI for when the drone's connection is compromised? How hard can it be?
This video overdramatizes the usage of drone in Ukraine, drone doesn't destroy million-dollar tanks alone. They are very accurate weapons but only carry small warheads so their purpose are to detrack or disable the tank engine, when it's achieved, the tank crew will just abandon the vehicle. A disabled tank can still be recovered and repair easily, but until then, artillery can hit that abandoned tank and destroy it more accurately. Also you selling drones as "the edge Ukrainian needs to fight Russia" is just wrong as the Russians also use drones heavily throughout this war on an industrial scale.
Your voice in this video is a little bit changed ..
Thanks bro for working on things your company wants you too without their hidden motive . Anyways i support Ukraine on this issue sad to see what politicians can do to just to boost their ego
i wonder what people will say when they see a video of palestinians with these DIY weapons.
Man I’m broadly supportive of Ukraine but this is just so “gushy” that I’m reflexively turned off. You get sold on too hard you start to go “wait, is this propaganda? Why would they need to push propaganda?”
The toughest GTA Vice City Mission was after all futuristic.
All that money they got and they gotta create drones from Amazon smh
@ididathing
War and Porn are what's pushing the technology industry forward.
The Russians use the “sledgehammer “ war tactic.  Meat and metal.  The Ukrainians use poison darts!  Go Ukrain!
Congratulations to Ukrainians for their innovative effort to resist invasion. i hope you achieve the liberation you deserve.  And since we are talking about young people resisting invasion by a foreign invader. i hope someday the Palestinian resistance efforts get the same heroic spotlight put on them  In this last month and half. they were fighting an occupying force with support from the biggest militaries in the world (USA)  I understand the conflict of interest that any ukranian is up against when it comes to speaking about Palestine. But invaders are invaders, The colonial attitudes of the USA are no different than Russia's. they just have different aesthetics and flag colors  Inshallah a free Ukraine ❤️ and a free Palestine ❤️
Is continuously changing the thumbnail working? I mean Is it really working with CTR ? When next thumbnail will be displayed Johnny ?
Israel has a lazer system that initially was invented to protect from rockets. I think on-tank drone protection can be an easy pivot.
Can someone explain to me Why western media is drawing this heroic picture about this resistance from the Ukrainian people but would call Palestinians in Gaza who are doing the exact same thing barbaric and terrorists??
reality is different on the Ground , Ukraine has already lost the war, thanks to us/uk war criminals that have got their country destroyed completely
In reality Top war ammunition manufacturing private companies of USA, EU are making immensely huge profits from these wars. Latest data shows they increased about 400% in profits by this RUSSIAN-UKRAINE WAR & ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT. So they want the WARS TO BE CONTINUED. . .😢😢😢😢
Russia has a right to defend itself
The story at arms races time immemorial. Nothing new. Yes, the world is watching, but more and more are seeing past the propaganda. This proxy war is all about the US and biased “journalists and journalism” aren’t helping to end it.
Propaganda.....ffs
I only just watched Avatar 2 on a flight recently. while watching it I found myself thinking how useless the large war machines were. Sure they have firepower, but they are so easily destroyed and incapacitated, taking whoever is in it together with them. So expensive war machines does not achieve anything for the users (or anyone actually), but also becomes a death trap for whoever uses them. who the f in their right minds pays for and uses them? idiots who starts war. the only ones profiteering are the military contractors making them, as such, they are all scammers. War, huh. What is it good for? Absolutely nothing.
⚠️ ⚠️ All those millions of Dollars the U.S Government 💸is sending to Ukraine and these guys are using cheap drones to combat the Russians?? 🤔 I dunno but someone is lying. Where is OUR tax money going⁉️⁉️
Great video! But you revealed too much details imho.
This is legit Dedsec from Watch Dogs universe... Since I was a kid I dreamed of having an RC drone or helicopter, attach mic and camera and spy on people... its so satisfying to watch such thoughts and dreams come true...
My guy, you called it a "quiet revolution" but then you blast all their secrets in a documentary? Isn't this just going to put targets on their backs? (If I'm wrong someone please educate me)
Why isnt Zelenskyy buying up drones for the war? If they're so cheap and effective, where did thet tens of billions of dollar from the US go?
Jhony harris is a person who support ukrainian soldiers not Palestinian freedom fighters
Palstinian resistance Has red triangle is so much strong u forget to talk about
Propaganda video...
Ukrainian have the right to defend themselves, Palestinians haven't. 🔻🇵🇸🔻
these drones and the 3d printed submachine guns in Myanmar are the most interesting things to come out of modern wars.
It's going to change terrorism forever, too.
You've changed the thumbnail three times and the title twice in less than 24 hours.
Im curious if Harris should have blurred faces for certain people to prevent unwanted exposure?
So cool and interesting topic. This will change war tactics for sure.
When your school project is to make a 20min film, but you only have 5 min of footage. Copy Pasta!
Good video, but it is stupid to show this publicly. Russia gonna see.
"Pulling a 'Johnny Harris'" -- When you purposefully change the title and thumbnail 24 hours after releasing a video because the original was obviously inaccurate and misleading, but clickbait is super important in the first few hours.
Thanks for this video!  Next step... AI drones from Star trek that shoots phasers :(  then robot armies from star wars.
Thank you, Johnny! I can foresee the United States, when they figure out how to make them less jammable, sending a whole container or two over there stuffed with pre-loaded drones.
Two years from now we are going to start seeing US army recruiters infiltrating fpv drone discords
BF3
Nice propaganda. Setting one against another. Its the pentagon and its stooges that are the biggest threat to humanity. This war and the loss of life at an unprecedented scale could have been avoided. The Russians and The Ukrainians have much more in common than their supposed differences. The US in their absolute criminality is creating another Israel-Palestine situation here that has no solution. That ultimately brings in profit for US war machine. Absolutely abhorrent.
the FPV drone community in Ukraine was very underestimated till the was
12:00 its heart warming to see how united Ukraine is wish Europ and Amerika would support them more, Go Ukraine never give up!
I wonder if we'll see ground vehicles outfitted with complex anti-drone countermeasures. Lot's of modern tanks have 'hard-kill active protection systems' that shoot down rockets/missiles/atgms before they hit the vehicle.
Propaganda alert!
They need drones that check for jamming signal direction and then b line to the emitter. 😂
Hey Johnny, where can I donate for Ukraine?
Another great video!  I really appreciate these unpopular topics that you cover that provide a lot of extra depth to complicated topics.  The one thing that this video highlights (though you don't explicitly call it out) is the failure of the West to provide all of the weapons that Ukraine needs to defend itself.  Between our reticence to deliver heavy weapons, the fear of nuclear reprisals and the though that it will precipitate a domino effect has all lead to Ukraine finding unique and creative ways of closing the gaps between our capability to support Ukraine and our actual support.  I'd love to see a follow up to this topic where you dig into all the redlines that Moscow rattles at NATO and the consequences as we have crossed them.  It might make a good case for supporting Ukraine better then we have been, especially if we saw the weak numbers that we have sent compared to our promised commitments.
Thank you for the video ❤
Slava Ukraini 💙💛
Sooo you changed the title? :( I'm guessing the comments on your community post didn't feed the "youtube algorithm" well enough?  Edit: And you changed it yet again...
👍👍👍
2 years ago every nation that has a formidable fighting force wiped there face thanking Russia for showing them drones can be extra deadly. It was bound to happen anyways it just happen to be that Russia was the one to invade a country that didn’t welcome foreign troops on their land🤣🤣
Hey Johnny! Loved this video. I had no idea about how resilient and resourceful the ukraine state and its people are. However, if I may add one concern regarding worldwide journalism. We as a people are desensitized to conflict like this. We viewers have less and less interest in global events when they are too heavily covered. My concern arises when you make many videos on this conflict but have yet to talk about  2023 Syria or even the constant coups going on in Africa. Please dont take this as hate but as positive criticism. As a popular journalist, many of these news outlets also cover the same topic and therefore get very overwhelming and over-covered in news. Please if you want to make a change and not care about "ratings" please reach out to me. I am a college student looking to make journalism a more wide spread and uniform mission.
Where's the drone that zaps the controller of that drone that homes in on the signal in sonic speed.
seems good, military should focus and save money instead of putting it on tanks.
It is not the Ukraine will which is helping them it is the American money which is helping them sustain the war maybe the us doesn’t want to end the war
IDF are doing drones since 2005 using the Sky Rider unit. Learning comes from experience and the world only now sees this.
Johnny, I enjoy your content, but I have a question of why you showed the drone makers (who are most likely responsible for thousands of Russian troops deaths)...faces & names?
See real beginning, then do another video.
Russia will win.
Stop NATO, stop war
johnny harris the bandera propaganist guy
🟥🟥🟥🟥these whole thing keep knoking me of advance warfare cod🟥🟥🟥🟥we r literaly here
This is also a huge amount of data for NATO Militaries and a sort-of test of the ‘porcupine strategy’ that the US wants to use for Taiwan.
Was it just me or did that dude at 12:35 die?
It gets even wilder as technology improves. Advances in AI and autonomous piloting could open the door to drone swarms that could be given a variety of tasks that the entire group will work toward to accomplish. It could act like a flock of birds or school of fish with how they move to avoid collisions and keep some sort of cohesion, all to overwhelm opponent defenses with cheap and easily replaceable vehicles that could be hard to individually target. And of course, without human intervention. It's frightening to think this could be possible and what conflicts could devolve into in the future.  Hopefully it won't be full Skynet...yet.
Jerryrigging a commercial drone for the purpose of weaponization is going to be commonplace this century. The War in Ukraine (being a mix of old-school, positional warfare with modern technology) has proven to be a battleground for what future warfare might be like.
Is Russia winning or losing the war???
Believe it or not a $200 RPG warhead can also destroy a tank
the bomb drones in warzone work pretty well
some sussy things came up about u sir u gonna answer or no
I studied National Security in college, and had to do an assignment on an article titled "Technologies Converge and Power Diffuses" by an author named TX Hammes. In it he talks about how 3D Printing, AI, Nanotechnology, and cheap Drones are being made available to small-scale actors, and are thus ushering in a new era of warfare that places a larger emphasis on defensive tactics rather than offensive and precision-strike tactics.
GO RUSSIAN
Remember there is a flip side to this. These same tools were used by Hamas terrorists during their October 7th attack on Israel
This is def the best title for this one 🙌
Incredible journalism. Thank you for what you do
I remember, the very first time i used a drone. One of those Parot drones.. FIRST Flight, I immediately saw the Military applications. 1. INSTANT Recon.. In a full 360 degree's. Game changing, for the common infantryman. NEXT came the thought of a weaponized drone. IE one, that has a remote to drop a payload...  THIS Kamikaze, version is frightening. RIGGED up 2.75 rocket warheads... HOLY Moly. RPG7 warheads.. Swarms to boost signals. Drones for spotting, This is a full blown Terminator level warfare. From a range of 3-6 miles.. First person hit.. With another drone verifying.  Just imagine an US Military variant. Only need 5-10min flight time. Constructed, for pure carnage, not pieced together. THIS is the Terminator level.. Just think.. Ai, is here as well.. ITS getting closer and closer.
USA talks about "the future of war". Isn't that a swell line of thought!?
WE WANT MORE MORMAN CHURCH VIDEOS!!!!  NO!! WEEEE NEEEEED MORE MORMAN CHURCH VIDEOS!!!
w..tf India is not available on incongi 😢
Now terrorists will use this as well
Nah 3 thumbnail in one day😂
free palestine
that last line... kinda creepy
small drones are not the future of warfare, but they are the future of guerilla warfare
2 videos this week? Heck yeah
Imagine the Iraq and Afghan wars if they had these drones vs us when we went in...would have been a more devastating story
Great video Johnny!
Gotta give props to the engineers and technicians over there helping out their countrymen
I predicted this 8 years ago. No one cared what I had to say.
I remember constantly dying from drones from playing COD: Black Ops
No shit we been known this since black ops 2.
Why not just program the drone so that it don't need to control it 🤔
Now Engineers will start UPGRADING this Tanks with EMF's, That will shut down any radio transmitting Device. reason is this drones transmit almost 99% of their signals via a frequency of 2.5GHZ.
The sad part this will be used in the next war the same way ieds were used in Iraq. Many people apluad the technology when it is used by "their" side but their only purpose is to cause lost of life and suffering.
Russia needs to lose
Booster drones and swarms of mesh-networked drones are a great solution to jamming.   It is notable that Ukraine largely develops drones in house whereas Russia just buys drones from other nations.
I’ve been building and flying FPV drones since the “mini quad” was invented around 2014. This is fascinating to watch but also scary. We’ve been fighting for our right to fly since the beginning. This sort of thing is doesn’t help our cause. The push has always been to allow the big guys like Amazon and Fedex to fly commercially and take away hobbyists rights. Now they are using them for war. I understand the focus is on Ukraine being the “good guys,” but they are not the only side using them now.
Thanks!
So proud of every Ukrainian contributing to our freedom! Thank you Johnny for covering this story 💙💛
I want your monitor!
If palastinians did this they would acuse them of terrorism
Just wait until these start showing up in America DJI drones everywhere this will be bad
If I was DJI, I would make a line of military-spec drones then watch the money print itself
Man, I don’t even care who wins, I just love seeing the new advancements.
tbh bro i havent looked at any ukraine news since israel started their genocide against palestinians, usually i appreciate your content but this feels a lil idk how to put it, i guess wrong is the easiest, in terms of like we're watching military force be applied in a way that is a war crime especially against the palestinian people and youre over here talking about how cool bombs strapped to cheap drones are like glad ukraine is resisting but also they have backing from european powers, you know who doesnt? the people in palestine being ethnically cleansed for existing where there's oil western powers want access to
@Johnnyharris Yo! Should have censored the names and faces of the drone makers. Think about it. You just gave Russia targets to slow the flow of drones.
War is when government tells us who the enemy is. Revolution is when we figure it out for ourselves. Take the profit out war and there will be no more war.
Not a big sports person but I am enjoying search party.
LONG LIVE UKRAINE❤❤❤
Scary as all hell awesomeness!
we all can laugh and mock how cheap diy drone destroying russian million dollar tank but  its pretty much the same as what russian did with their cheap lancet vs leopard a6 and challenger 2, which is way more expensive than russian tanks.  no tanks are safe with this new age of warfare.
great video!
I think Johnny killed the icogni link haha
Why don't you cover your "brothers" From Gaza??  They're journalists tooo
If the weapon doesn't at least cost more than a million, the government isn't interested.
Now that we've mastered how to kill each other.  We''re now mastering how to do it as efficiently and cheaply as possible.  Sheesh
Johnny please make an unbiased video on Henry Kissinger. I feel as though his life and career lend themselves to your channel's theme.
Shche ne vmerla Ukrayina! Shinzou wo Sasageyo! Tatakae! Tatakae! Tatakae!
You should have blurred their face and change voice. They should be kept anonymous for their safety.
I should point out that Perun and others have pretty effectively pointed out that Russia *does not* have air superiority in Ukraine, and in fact Ukraine's airspace is still heavily contested. In large part due to the fact that both Russia and Ukraine started the war with large numbers of anti-air missiles.
when a drone can go under 40dB, thing will going crazy
SLAVA UKRAINI!
I can't watch this video. I can't hear you talk over the bells in the beginning Johnny!
I don’t agree with a lot of Harris’s views on things but I love to watch him. His in-depth videos are something that I love and it’s always good to listen to people you don’t agree with. Keep up the amazing work.
Oh and guess what, if palestinians do the same thing, they will be called terrorists.
This is not an era of war. Humans are using technologies to dig own graves.
is this propaganda? am I being encouraged to support ukraine’s Drone force? I’m not opposed personally but somewhat offended by this breach ( imo) of journalistic neutrality.
Myanmar's pro-democracy rebels against their military junta are also using drones.
15:32 Wait, what do you mean you didn't print the documents so you can highlight them? I came here for the highlighters and you slamming papers on your table!
Yay, more weapons!
I find it quite hilarious the difference in sentiment when comparing this to what is happening in Palestine. Essentially, the same exact thing is happening on both sides - Russia invading Ukraine and Israel invading Palestine.   The media doesn't want you to view it in that manner but, for all intents and purposes, it really is the exact same thing. Johnny doesn't see it either. I love your videos, but surely you can see the hypocrisy??
Imagine Johnny video if last quote was said by a Palestinian
Really interesting video , but should you be giving away Ukrainian secrets …?  Despite that I adore your journalistic videos ❤❤❤🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Work smart
is russia gonna target the universities bc of this video?
The war of the future is scary. It's been tough to be patriotic as an American in the last few years... but you can't deny our military, it's better to have and not need, than need and not have.
Nice vid. First 5 mins could have been edited out though. Keep them coming.
Maybe we'll get Factorio-style logistic drones in warzones soon.  Just imagine foods and meds being delivered to the frontline via drones.  In times of war, drones aren't only useful for destruction. It can also be used for humanitarian aid.
thank you for supporting Ukraine
A great current topic to look into would be the Venezuela and Guyana border dispute!!!
Crazy that the US military, that has been using larger airplane-style drones absolutely horrifically for years, could be short sighted about smaller, consumer grade drones with deployable IEDs.  Never underestimate folks trying to fight back in wartime.  Civilians are only civilians until they are forced to fight to survive.  Then they're guerillas.
Can someone explain to me how is Ukraine fighting Russian occupation, different that Palestinians fighting israeli occupation?
Im a little nervous for these guys showing their faces if ukraine loses
I love how this video is about a war that has been going on almost for two years -without counting previous conflicts- but spam is taking over our lives
Great vid Johnny. Слава Україні!🇺🇦
It's cool how they 3d print a part that holds a modified grenade with a release servo that is activated by wiring the auxiliary  landing LED circuit to it.  Many videos of Mavic drones that can carry two grenades that can be released independently are out there.  That is super cheap and effective
It’s even worse when Russia does the same to western made tanks given to Ukraine which are triple the price of most Russian tanks, Abrams is like $15 million, Leopard 2 is like $7 million, compared to the $3 million that the T-90M is
虽然在吹乌克兰的无人机，结果乌克兰是被无人机干的最惨的。这个频道就是收钱吹水最牛逼的。
My question is if the problem is that they are disturbing the signal of the drone, why dont they use machine learning to make drones that can spot tanks and have a mape of where it needs to go. And use that ai in all there drones
It's great that Ukrainians are using drone technology to fight off the Russian invasion. Is it a good idea to share all this information for Russia to learn from? The less they know the better.
Soon we will have drone to drone dogfight, and makin drone become a smaller air group combat and airforce dedicated to only drone
You should make a video about Palestine
Corporative war 2.0
Yup drones are game changer
What happened to getting our Nebula videos ahead of time Johnny :(
extremistas peleando contra extremistas 🍿🍿🍿
The adaptability & ingenuity Ukraine has shown is the most inspiring thing right now in this modern era. It's crazy how a country without a Navy has been able to destroy & defend against a country with a Navy. The same goes with every aspect of this battle against these war criminals. America might have more resources & advanced items but i guarantee that America is No Where Near as adaptive & versatile as Ukraine has shown. Not just in the troops aspect but in the way that Ukraine's been able to be so adaptive in the overall systems structures & leadership organization roles aspects.. it's hard to describe but i know my country of America is one thing: and that our system, government, leadership, organization is NOT ADAPTIVE or flexible AT ALL. It really limits our ability to adjust, adapt, innovate through the use of ingenuity and resourcefulness... That is one of the key things i admire most about Ukraine. It's been really eye opening to see how you guys have been able to harness such beneficial aspects of ingenuity to try and overcome such a difficult situation and i truly think anyone can learn from you guys.
Russia has a right to defend itself. Russia has a right to exist.
Video gamers have been preparing for this since forever ago.😂
civilians arent experts on military anything
Little ceasers pizza box on the table????? Very interesting
Welcome to the M.I.
So... Ya didn't use ANY of the choices from yesterday's poll?!? Real Nice, Johnny! 🤕 😄 You landed on the best possible title anyway... Keep up the GREAT WORK, Mr. Harris! 🤠
Why don’t you mention what provoked Russia   NATO expansion
Is impressive the narrative that a "much powerful country against a smaller one" applied to Russia/Ukraine (correctly, by the way). Because it is exactly what the US just did last 80 years with Vietnam, Iraq and so on. Russia is absolutely wrong sided in this war exactly the same way the US just did after WWII to this very day.
why don't they all carry jammer? the analog transmition used by drone is not hard to jam
I feel uneasy about the safety of the people identified in this video. They sound important to Ukraine's war efforts and Russian infiltration is everywhere as evidenced by the number of Russian Oligarchs who have fallen out of windows lately.
Am I the only one seeing the next step will be for them to use open source AI systems on board drones? We all need personal EMPs when this tech turns on us 😮 this isn't really possible yet as the smallest LLMs still need too much gpu or cpu power, but these processing power requirements are dropping fast. Especially if the ai is fine tuned just to "safely" hit a target... 😐
Ur war propaganda, johnny
There is no mention on the US COUP in 2014???? Odd
Biased journalism
Am I crazy, or has this video been renamed more than once since it was released earlier today?     Is this some kind of algorithm manipulating thing?
Report on russian drones..... racist😊
Down vote for embedding an advertisement. There is a reason people pay for YouTube, so please respect it.
Nice vid.  Sad you’re supporting more endless war.  Never woulda happened with Trump in office.
Russia is liberating not invading. Thanks cia johnny. Imagine supporting the side of actual nazis
i bet he will change the thumbnail 10 times
@JohnnyHarris You've got the link wrong, it says Incongi instead of Incogni.
The Meta is crazy. Big and Old artillery from the first 2 world wars combined with cutting edge drone technology.  Just shows you how important information is, you don't need the newest and biggest guns if you know where to aim.
Cool,  now make this same video for the Gazan resistance fighters with the same amount of national pride and determination to keep their country from being swallowed up by the enemy. Or are you too afraid to report the same ideas for a group that doesn’t have western support?
sad part is that Russia doesn't have to win for Ukraine to be doomed
Today I stumbled upon this video multiple times on my YT home page, every time with a different title and different image preview. Is just me or it happened to anyone else?
When I see Ukrainians, I see Palestinians. Both are going through the same
Those students have the 1000 mile stare, war is garbage. what is Russia thinking?
what a phucking great video my man!
Why and how have you not uploaded a full length video on Palestine...
F war
Please talk about South America, and special the Venezuela and Guyana dispute about Essequibo territory. I think this tension can be a other front for futures wars!
You do know Russian uses them as well, right? They are not wunderwaffes.
The @15:05 unit patch is wild for the drone operators
And don’t make it seem like these guys are doing good for their country, they’re profiting of these drones just like any other pig
Really disappointed on this video, you’re just spreading propaganda and honestly Ukraine doesn’t need any more help they got themselves in this mess let figure it out
Use Dron repellent
Free Palestine
Wonder if the same kind of video would be made about resistance fighters in Gaza
Слава Украине 💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛
U very wrong about how the war started...
Anybody remember the Black Mirror episode where drones were used for assasinations, as well as mass swarm killings?
This video is gut-wrenching. It's truly chilling to realize what these low-cost killer machines can do in the wrong hands and, most crucially, how much money, youth talent, and scientific effort is poured into building them − the Pentagon document is shocking.  The journalistic effort is laudable and no judgement can be passed on Ukrainians trying to defend.  However, I bet such footage is probably romanticized and dressed with rock music in Russia as well. We tend to not appreciate fully what a grim future drone warfare can bring, especially with AI-driven automated decision making.  We must talk about global disarmament again and this time seriously. Full destruction of warheads and weapons, disbandment of armies, with verifiability mechanisms. The big armed powers must sit down for honest negotiations, and I'm afraid they can only be pushed to do so by their citizens.  I dare even say that pieces like this should sound this alarm instead of leaving a lingering sense of romanticization.
How can you donate to these makers?
Thanks for the video.
Anyone else notice that the thumbnail and title of the video changed like 3-4 times?
I dunno….isnt it a bad idea to show the engineers faces and names….
This is very brave and courageous of the Ukrainians,  I wish the Palestinians had access to the same technologies to help free their land as well.  But it doesn't help if they are living in a concentration camp for decades with no access to basic life necessities, not just the drones 🇵🇸🇵🇸
As a Ukrainian I would like say thank you for picking up this topic about war in 🇺🇦 Ukraine. It’s really important we have to remember the war is keeping going and everyone have to help as much as possible to help Ukraine win!
I used to be in a mortar platoon so hearing him say "I heard the mortar whistling" was so cringe... mortars do not whistle. You did not interview an expert there.
Incogni link doesn't work bro
Hello my In-laws here comes the killer drone😂
Lol, I got a spam call right after starting this video.
When BF2042 came out, putting c4 on a recon drone and flying it into a tank was so effective and annoying that it had to be patched out for balance reasons. Strapping explosives to a vehicle and driving them into bigger and more expensive vehicles is like the oldest Battlefield tactic but the drone is so difficult to see and shot out the sky, that when you hear it you were basically done.  And here i thought it was so dumb you could do that when in fact it was accidentally realistic.
5:22 hmm making military gear in civilian infrastructure so the other side doesnt bomb it, eh?
Imagine home-made production of drones to became The Cheapest Mass Production of drones with AI. Ukraine will be unbeatable... But the best for everybody would be "the easiest way" - to stop destruction and find peace... Ask AI - it will say the same...
Watch the video and substitute Ukraine for Palestine and Russia for Israel. Literally the same story.
Johnny, im loving your Videos. please keep up the great work on the videos. I look forward to each one you put out.
Only if humans used their intelligency to fix worlds problems instead of killing each other. I have a dream.
Another sign these times a weird (including appreciating used cars). A “toy maker” allow me the term,  became the last line of defence of the first European war in 70 years.
Defending themselves from Russia is Resistance but Defending yourself from Israel USA is terrorism. WTF.
I don't think they can get your *browser* history, but they might be able to get a small portion of your *browsing* history. This is possible because companies like Google who serve a lot of ads are able to track your fingerprint across the internet. So if you block that tracking, they won't have that *browsing* history, or will have a very small amount of it.
What's the point in exposing ones tactics in a war? If it was a very important move Ukraine should not let it be in a you tube video. Or I'm very wrong
I used to be on the fence in this conflict until the occupied (Ukraine) sided with the occupier (Israel)... boggles my mind. But then again Zelensky is a Zionist so it all makes sense. Viva Russia I guess.
I love not living in the US.  I can just tell companies to not email me by clicking on a link, or just send an angry email... and they'll shut up (I have only had to do that one time so far).  I can put my phone on a do not call list, and for the few who ignore it I can just ignore them (I don't answer, If I see a number I don't recognize, I look it up, and if I see that it's spam I just don't respond, or call back), and if they don't shut up after the first time, I just block them, and the problem is solved. I barely get any spam emails, or spam calls.  And the little I get I can just stop for free with minimal effort. You should get your country to fix it with good laws instead of just solving it all with money... it won't last forever that way (yeah, the laws won't last forever either, but if they are good, they will work well for a long time).  Note: my way of solving it may not work everywhere, but for me, for where I live, it works just fine. Not everyone needs to pay for that simple stuff to be dealt with.
More videos on the Israel apartheid please
War ruined a beautiful hobby. what a wonderful piece of propaganda
I think it is just a matter of time before autonomous drones technology reaches the battlefield. This video does not cover this topic, but i think people would be surprised to see how quickly this field is evolving and the current capabilities that groups from universities like eth or mit have today. As for defense, well, you can't block a radio communication if there isn't one.
Awesome video as always!
Johnny: Talking about being incognito in the internet Also Johnny: uses Chrome
brother that monitor
Have you seen what Russia is doing now? Silly
When I covered this topic last month I was barely able to scratch the surface. Great video. When I deployed to Iraq over 10 years ago the drones we had organic to the platoon sounded like lawn mowers ripping through the sky and were about as heavy. Crazy to think they have hand held ones that each squad can have now. soon they'll follow you around on patrol like a little personal pet. A tomagotchi battle-buddy if you will. anyway, big fan of your content and story telling style, all the best !
Oh, damn, did the other video get taken down or is it a nebula exclusive now?
Haven’t even watched the video yet but I’ve see 4 different thumb nails - Jesus 😂
no one really talks about the war anymore so thank you for putting this out
As someone who has been building and flying these types of drones for quite a few years now I hate to see my hobby turned into weapons.   This stuff has been around for quite a long time now.  And it's kinda of messed up how much publicity it's receiving now   Hobby grade transmitters and receivers are able to reach up to 100km away now.  You can do this for under 100$ for the tx and rx.  Another 200$ gets you everything else you need.
Your incogni link doesn't seem to work.
Was the title of this video changed?
All I could do is watch with great sadness at the thought of human suffering occurring on all sides.
Slava Ukraini!
Russia lancet drone is a beast
Nice little piece of propganda you made johnny
An angry birds patch for an fpv kamakazi drone pilot is based 😂
So, does this channel of 4.62M Subscribers support small countries developing tech to defend themselves against the terror that is the U.S. and it's allies? Because, in this case, Ukraine, it's the U.S. and NATO that pushed this fatal confrontation.
@johnnyharris Do you have anything to substantiate the claim you make at around 8:02 that DJI is especially against Ukrainians using their drones?  The Reuters source quotes DJI as saying they do not want their drones used for any harm and suspended sales in both Russia and Ukraine, not indicating any particular bias toward either country.
wait so why exactly are we giving them billions of f@ckin dollars again??
what about Iseral invades palestine doesn't palestinians have the right to fight he occupation
Nope. Worse thumbnail. Change it back.
They should have just taken the peace agreement Russia offered instead of listening to the west telling them they could win the war.
you should look at ARtur Rehi channel he covers the war and drone warfare in detail
That is a great return on investment
Now this is a fantastic piece of reporting. 👍
There's a difference between data brokers and other forms of insidious spam. You'll never be off dark web lists. It's quite disingenuous.
It is like gamifying a war.  I don't like the quote about killing though.
The drone industrial complex
Great insights. Thanks for your work and the ukranians for volunteering the information
Now one can only hope you make another video showing the exploits of Palestinian resistance in the warfare to defend and free their country
I don't trust anything coming out of Ukraine
Hey Johnny, the word million is misspelled as "milliion" in the thumbnail.
would these drone makers be a target to the Russians?
Bro has changed the title and thumbnail six times in 7 hours.
Ukraine use Schools for military weapons = Terrorists  Bseiged Gaza does the same = Terrorist
Why do I feel like just a couple years ago Mr Harris would of been on the ground in Ukraine but now he outsourced this. Understanding He cant be on the ground for every single video but this one would of been probably less one sided if he was there instead of relying on a Ukrainian paper….
so russian jamming does work
Cool in call of duty they used drones
Thank you for sharing about these incredible efforts!
thank you for showing crucial information about Ukraine!
Can’t they put guns on them?
Western media covering NATO side of the story. As per usual. Boosting morale is about the only thing Ukrainians can do now.
Especially to all American viewers but also to everyone else: Supporting Ukraine benefits everyone in the western world so think twice when hating Biden for spending money on those hard working people, who are suffering and fighting for their country every singe day
The Japanese did somewhat of the same thing to America during WWII. Japanese solders would intentionally crash their airplanes into U.S. battleships. (Think of a suicide bomber.)
TZD
Wtf. That computer monitor you have! That's crazy.
As someone who has usually been an un-bais view, it's frightening to see you so pro civil warfare you are in this video. great information, however the undertone of justifying killing (regardless of scenario) just shows what a war and a team mentality can do to a persons position.
Even worse is that Russians with 40 drones (2x a week) make Ukrainians use 35 patriot missiles ( $4.1 MILLION DOLLAR PER UNIT) but i guess YT can demonetize you mention that fact...
Blackmirror status of concern.
If Palestinians said that last quote, hell would break loose
just wait until drones can  5G communicate and bounce the radio signal in fleets of drones at once, and having AI control or assist... it's coming
So, underground Ukrainians improvising weapons to fight "to keep their land" backed by billions and great powers are interviewed as heroes? However,  zero coverage of much weaker blockaded Palestinians improvising weapons to fight to win their land back😂😂😂
6:06 Russia does not in fact have air superiority.  They definitely should have by sheer numbers but they don't which is why their jets rarely enter Ukrainian airspace and instead launch long range cruise missiles from well within the safety of Russian airspace...
this is just scary
It didn't took me long to think if Ukrainians can do that, Russians can too. It was only briefly mentioned in the video but I guess there are now lots of Russian drones too. So, maybe not such a good idea after all. It's more like a Pandora's box they've opened.
Cartels in Mexico are already using drones to drop explosives  against civilian, police and military targets.
Good thumbnail changes, Johnny 👍
This is also a huge concern domestically in terms of homeland security from extremism.
this was all done with usa tax money and they still didnt win.
just think...ukraine was never gonna lose...any land. now they will lose the entire eastern ukraine. to russia. and western ukraine to blackrock. sounds like every other country the usa and russia TEAMED up to split 50/50. russia and usa are best friends historicly. change my mind lol ukranians are a pawn, they are fighting to lose their entire country
How is this unprecedented? This is probably the second thing everyone thought of the second drones came out. It was only a matter of time. Now self driving or digital mapping comes next.
so if you want a really sick drone. go to ukraine
The cost difference gets even higher when you consider how much training tank crews need when compared to drone operators, and thd costs of fuel and ammo, this goes from unfair to what the fuck.
How hard could it be to create a HARM style drone that targets jammers?
Russia ain't the problem, Putin is the problem.
R U S N I    P I Z D A
Drones or no drones John Did you ever mention that Putin wanted and offered peace?    Or are you now part of the western propaganda ?   Soon You will be able to do a video on yourself…..   Full scale invasion?  That is the most ridiculous statement.  If Moscow launched a full scale invasion there would be no Ukraine period.  Surely you understand that to be true…. If not you are clueless
Thank you!
I really loved this video, but i ralle wonder whats really is going on in Antarctica. Love you work never wtop uploading!!!!!
Hear Me Out! ::: Food Delivery but DRONES! this small drone industry needs to survive without war. So get the flight control system setup already and the industry will thrive not only at war but at home.
this is scary... such drones could be used by terrorists as well..
Drones will do for the army what aviation and carriers did for the navy. Early WW2 was a major paradigm shift that relatively few admirals saw coming. Yamamoto was one of the few Japanese officers not celebrating after Pearl Harbor because he saw that while many battleships had been destroyed, the US carriers had not been at port by pure luck - and they would be what decided the entire rest of the Pacific War.
The Russian GRU/FSB will try to disrupt the drone business. Beware of traitors in Ukraine.
Interesting! Thanks for sharing it. ✌️
And" most"of those videos you are showing  its ruskis attacking the ukrops
Killing the rc hobby I see great work gov will see this and regulate the hell out of our quad and planes also it does take much skill to build an fpv quad I did it when it was 13 year old with a hobbyking kk2
Both sides have them and to be honest the other side has more of them and more powerful especially with the electronic technology which ukrops dont have .. thats why they winning most of the leopards were taken out by those cheap drones
You should've blurred their faces honestly. This felt unprofessional.
This is clown show.
Incogni is cool. Way less phone calls and emails.
Thanks man I really appreciate and enjoy your content .
Thanks for your video and explanation of what is actually going on in Ukraine. Слава Україні!
7:41 - the shot of two men sitting on top of their vehicle launching a drone, nicely shows the blue sky and yellow field of the Ukrainian flag. :) Don't know if anybody else noticed..
Thank You - Memphis Tennessee USA 🇺🇸
So we doing straight up propaganda pieces now. Nice!
Hey Johnny how's your independent journalism going? where just last week you were referring to Hamas fighters as ISIS-like militants terrorists and now you have just uploaded a video on college kids making drones as freedom fighters. Westerners are some  next level hypocrites
They need to develop more reuseable drones. Drone may be cheaper than tanks but destroying the drone itself for a single attack is still quite wasteful of their resources. If they come up with more reuseable ones, each could probably do at least 10 bomb drop sorties before needing maintenace.
That last quote is powerful
Can we please STOP HUMILIATING Russia in the name of buffing up the coffers of our military-industrial complex???? we are creating too much instability around the world and seriously hurting our image as a global leader!!!!!
I wonder if Ukraine uses SEAD drones. Drones specifically equipped to hunt down and locate jammers. This would make it so Russia would have to keep the jammers off or risk the Jammer being hit by artillery.
Lol the spam ad in the middle of this very serious, deep and meaningful insight into a devistatrd war torn country fighting to survive was comedic genius 😅
gotta appreciate the aheago patch at 7:39 lol
Russia right now : WRITE THAT DOWN WRITE THAT DOWN!!!! 📝📝
LOL, Mr Harris ran out of subject! Very much afraid to touch the truth.
Thanks a lot for attention. For some reason the BIGGEST WAR since WW2 fading away from news media. But it is still going!
Soon enough 20 dollar autonomous drones with facial recognition and a little packet of plastic explosive 😐
sorry so out of context but these Ukrainian students making drones are so hot
My heart goes out to all those young people whose lives have been robbed of their childhood because Washington military industrial complex decided to use them as cannon fodder for their proxy war.
Why the hell are Ukrainians making there own drones when the United States Government is sending billions soon to be trillions in aid…. The soldiers are too busy facing enemies on the frontlines when it’s country’s politicians are the ones that are really killing them.
Ukraine must have gotten MW2019.
Ukraine is losing though and it’s about to be over with them conceding the area that Russia already controls. Sad that we  are being propagandized even by this YouTuber thinking Ukraine had a chance from the beginning. Military industrial complex is alive and well
Ukraine needs all the shilling it can get these days, stalemate is inevitable, the coping is admirable tho
It's very scary, when viewed in context - this may be currently in the realm of warfare between Ukraine and Russia, but these drone developments will surely be shared out there, on the dark web or wherever.   If you can build what is effectively a guided missile for a few thousand dollars... ? Where does that leave us?  In terms of terrorism, it's then just a case of obtaining the munitions to attach to the drones. If you view it in the light of issues countries like the USA have with internal terrorism - with nut jobs who shoot up schools ... "Oh, hey, I'm going to attach a grenade to this undetectable drone, fly it half a mile and then deploy..." "and by the way, I have 10 of them..."   Crazy, right? It's time that drone regulations get seriously beefed up - but how do you combat drones built from parts, using 3D printers?   Either way, in the war in Ukraine, we all clearly support any effort for the Ukrainian's to hold out and win this war - and drone tech is part of that.
Kindly look into war in Myanmar , there's also widespread usage of drones as bombers.You won't be disappointed.
Johnny, thank you! Ukraine needs your support, folks ❤
Be careful with DJI drones, as they broadcast their position and can be detected with the DJI Aeroscope Drone Detection System
Nigeria where are thou😶.
These drones aren't going to win anything.  Johnny Harris ain't that bright.  This isn't a war for Ukraine in its entirety, Ukraine already lost the section of the country that wanted to secede anyway, nothing but pointless trench war now, lines are already drawn.
**sigh**
I wonder if some of these guys will eventually become future arms manufacturers since they are breaking so much new ground. New industries there.
Lol, so many Kremlin bots here hahahaha
It really should be titled "How to lose a war.....". Ukraine has no way of winning.
Every ukranian in this video should've been wearing a mask
I would have liked to watch this as I like your content but I had to give up because of the irritating, repetitive background music. Please stop using such pointless music that doesn't add any value to the video and only makes it distracting and annoying.
I like original title more just didn’t have chance to watch. Cool vid!
Thanks for this video. For everyone who wants to support Ukraine pls search for one of these: - Come back alive. - Serhiy Prytula Charity Foundation. - Sternenko FPV (I think he doesn't have his site, but has chanel in YouTube)
When Ukraine resists an invasion they are fighting for freedom. When Palestine resists an invasion, they're terrorists. Hilarious.
Johnny can you do a video on the nazi problem in Ukraine? Like the rise of azov
All of this thanks to Zelensky puppet government.  Poor ukranian People, they must realize their government sold them out.
and now they are dead. Seriously. Showing their identity, giving their names was pretty reckless considering Russia's well known strategy of assassinations.
Thank you for this video, Johnny 🙏 Slava Ukraini ✊🇺🇦
If Ukraine had kept their word about not attacking Donbass region and ethnic cleansing this tragedy would had been averted
yet Ukraine LOST the war months ago..
Im Johnny and I change my titles for my videos six times to increase visibility
Why Ukrainian resistance is not called terrorism  ?
The "background" music and sounds is way too loud. Really can't concentrate on the conversations and the actual video topic.
The signal jamming problem is going to be the biggest challenge going forward. I think radio control is eventually going to become obsolete, as overpowering jammers requires more and more transmission power.  The most promising solutions to this problem are line-of-sight control using optical wavelengths (i.e. lasers), and eliminating the need for a remote operator by allowing the drones to fly themselves to the target. Using lasers, you not only become immune to jamming, but you also prevent the enemy from being able to listen to radio signals that alert them of an incoming drone.
Intresting Insights..!
I feel like disposable drones are gonna become staples of the future battlefield. The Ukrainian-Russian conflict is only the beginning of their use. Hell, if you look at how the US Marine Corps is planning to re-structure their platoons and squads, they actually intend to have their own drone operators. On the platoon level. Small mobile units capable of independent operation will be getting their own individual drones. That is such a crazy advantage to be able to give war fighters The integration is happening, warfare is evolving.
you are so mis-guided.  you need to know the truth. Ukraine attacked their own people in Donbas in 2014. And did that for 8 straight years. Bombing and killing innocent civilians. Then happened February 2022 and the scale was tipped. Russia will win as they also have adapted to the drone war and electronic war. Ukraine will lose no matter have biased you are. There are good people in Ukraine. They deserve peace and prosperity.
Drones are also biggest infantry support for the resistance forces (PDFS) of Myanmar.
Also, let's not forget that ISIS did this before Ukraine.
Thank you so much for such an amazing video !
Fascinating. To be honest: I would very much prefer that this kind of innovative energy could go into something constructive instead of creating weapons which kill people. But I acknowledge that the Ukranians have no other choice here, and I applaud their ingenuity.
On the Chinese Internet, we all jokingly call China's three major arms dealers: DJI, Laiyang Steel Pipe Factory, Gas Tank Company...
The scary thing is this may give gangs, cartels and warlords some ideas
😅  And yet they can't defeat Russians even with all that aid they are getting 😮
Am I the only one that sees a big terrorism problem with this?
Did you literally leak the names of Ukrainian  resistance fighters to the Russian authorities? Anyway, love your videos, keep it up man!
changed the title to get more views lool
slava ukraini
I’m yes whatever Ukraine 🇺🇦 can do to win the war. But I think of how this will change warfare
So let me get this right, when Ukranians do it it's called heroism, but when Palestinians do it, they're called terrorists? Right, got it. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for Resistance and I'm with Ukraine to defend their territory, I just wish you'd think the same
Change title and thumbnail back
Aren't you concerned that Russian intelligence could track this guys and take them down?
I know, I’m probably unpopular for saying this, but I go absolutely crazy with your sound. That background noise overpowers your voice and it is so annoying. Please please, I beg you I love your videos, turn down the background noise. Your content is wonderful.
modern warfare is literally a video game irl
Who told them they couldn’t “keep their country” ?
Youtube keeps censoring what I've tried saying. Not sure what has been against guidelines... I wish it would say something. 🙄 Drones cool.
Hey the intro music is annoying and your voice is muffled
They lied to you.
Kind of crazy how you edit this a certain way, add certain music, and make talking about people building weapons to kill other human beings sound like they're running a charity startup.
Win?
👏😲
So Johnny, what do we know about the RUSSIAN drone-game. Are they innovative? Are they thinking, or are they just bluntly pumping in flesh and artillery? Should Russia beat the Ukrainians in this department with some clever tweak or use of this technology, could they turn the fait of the war? And if so, what is the geopolitical scenario then?  It would be nice to know. The US is obviously thinking about the consequences of this war, but are the Europeans even watching? I want to know these things, as a European.
Ukraine has been out of news all of sudden not only because Israel Palestinian war but mainly because Ukraine has lost and the media and government don’t know how to tell Americans that the war they both hyped up for 16 plus months is coming to the terms dictated by Russia
This is just the beginning. Wait until these drones have the capability to use facial recognition and thermal detection and all it needs is a operator to confirm when to detonate the bomb. The bombs will get bigger and more deadlier. Imagine they start to have AI help improve upon higher kill rates. Imagine not just bombs, but equipping weapons that can shoot and explode through walls and Imagine boosting how far it can go. Drones with facial recognition can be used to assassinate important enemies and execute any person they want. This is a scary future.
İts basically back to the ancient time where a greek warrior was an absolute unit, now each soldier will have a rocket launcher, a drone a night vision and more.mm
This was so fascinating but also scary at the same time that you could be minding your business and get KO’d by a drone. I also admire the resilience of Ukraine.  Also not sure why the mass production of these drones is not being funded by Ukraine. You would think that they would empower these individuals to make them.
Thank you for this video! Love from Kyiv 💙💛
I swear if Johnney Harris prints something and shows it to us, I'm turning off the video.
Who's winning a war???😂😂😂😂
Oh boy, this is scary!
Why aren't they painting the bottom of those drones sky blue and cloud white?
In “The Ministry for the Future”, drones play an interesting role as weapons used against the powerful people destroying the planet for profit. The way they are used in the book seems very plausible given the way we are seeing them used in Ukraine.
I don’t think Ukraine is wining though 😂
Cheap drones are a real force multiplier in asymmetric warfare, and drones have turned the tide against much powerful forces in Myanmar as well, and have proven very effective in real battles.  This drone warfare is a true revolution in asymmetric warfare.
Johnny "CIA" Harris with another banger 🎉
At 9:53 there is a very disturbing image shown at the back of the shirt of the Ukrainian student. Pls censor that, really disturbing.
i love your journalism but ive noticed youve changed a video title and thumbnail recently to more clickbait-y stuff. Just my opinion but as someone who’s passionate abt journalism, it kind of makes you seem less serious which is why i originally fell in love with ur channel. I get that ur trying to get the algorithm to pick up ur vids but don’t do it at the expense of a little bit of ur integrity as a journalist
Already did that in Black Ops 2
The war ain't over, kind of irresponsible to share a video with the faces and methods of the guys behind all this!
if Palestinians would do that, they would be called terrorist by usa and eu immediately. Slava Ukraini.
lol this is the third different thumbnail.
Misleading title. Ukraine is not winning the war in any way with any weapon, with any drone nor anything else. It's just being crushed by Russia.
The biggest threat/saviour to this world is the ability to make do with whatever they have rather than chasing the best and shiniest. In NZ we call it having an 8-wire attitude.   Mohd Atta and his men used butter knives meant for inflight meals to trigger the worst terrorist attack of the 21st century to date. Those same things could be used to save lives on planes.   Moral of the story: people not weapons have the power to kill and save people.
Johnny Harris left Vox to make more impressive journalism independently. This is super impressive, great work Johnny and team.
does no one sees the issue with this ??now imagin a goverment with a force of these things that is using exactly this tech to supres there citizens ....
This conflict did NOT begin in 2022…what an embarrassingly ignorant take.
Once of my fave podcasts stuff you should know refused to talk about this like years ago say something along the lines of no good can come from this well cats of the bag now and what really worries me is anyone can do this including terrorists luckily they are not the smartest bunch
Hum, i like the documentary but it kinda put a bigger target on their back ? Idk 🤷‍♂️ but great documentary
Everything those engineers are doing has been done by hobbies ts for like a decade here on youtube, which means they just need to have the drive to learn about it online, and dont even need to be engineers to make them. which is less of a barrier than people realize.
Are you going to talk about the fact that despite the billions of aid given ti Ukraine government, its the soldiers who are paying for the drones. Mr journalist stop being biased and give good and honest report.
Even Dji didn't know what they have created. Over engineered masterpieces.
If usa had not pushed unnecessarily Ukraine would have been peaceful
@15:40 This is something I have discussed before but we already have a fantastical solution for this. A while back there was the controversy on U.S providing Ukraine with M864 and M483A Cluster munitions. That was an incredibly controversial topic at the time dude to the whole panic effect even mentioning cluster munition creates in public's eye. To understand why this munition is so incredibly important, we need to discuss what is inside of this munition. This shell contains 72 M42 anti-armor submunitions. A cluster bomb can be disassembled and individual bomblets can be dropped from these drones. For Ukraine this means a single $500 drone, now has the capability to take out a Russian tank. Tanks are especially vulnerable to this form of attack since neither the tank itself, not its accompanying infantry can do anything to defend the tank from this form of attack from the above. The bonus effect of this use case is that a controlled drop of a submunition in this way will also significantly reduce the risk of a dud.
The russians have a big drone factory. And much more drones...
The future of drone swarm UAV are AI with image recognition satellite constellation for command and control
@johnyharris, Interesting how the word "Resistance is used extensively here, but in the "The War is Spreading" video, you said "To resist", but did not dare call it resistance. You completely trivialized/ignored the Palestinian struggle, and focused on how it's all about "Iran". If the same logic were applied to this video, then the reason for problems in Ukraine is NATO, not Russia, the invader. I'm sorry Johnny, but your research showed bias and surface level understanding. I'm disappointed in you.
Thanks all for supporting!
Hey Johhny! Great content as always. pls check your incogni link, it misses an character that make link not working directly.
Loved this collaboration! Support Ukraine and support the Kyiv Independent 💙🖤
16:57... I have always wanted to win a big PowerBall for myself, but right now if I win 800 millions I would put a factory to give this guy drones.
Win a a war?
For someone who throws himself in to so many injustices head first its very telling theres so little about Israels apartheid from you. Also these comments look filtered.
“COD Black ops 2 theme song starts playing”
Amazing video!
16:57 I'm just wondering what if a Palestinian said this about Jews.
Should this video really be showing the faces of the ukranian drone makers?
Holly shit, why did you show their faces. The economist had recently talked in their podcast and how Russia tries to hit drone making squads. Because of how valuable they are. @johnnyharris
👇❤ If you appreciate the yellow ad bar
need an unbiased video on the war in Gaza by Johnny Harris!!
oooh war crimes
Proaganda
Thanks you for your support!
Hi to all the Russians watching this
mmmh.. if i was the drone maker (the young guy from crimea) ill be scared for my life... you guys litterally put a target on him.
One more amazing video with a lot of info. But i  also think that everything is staged i mean anything happens is controled im not sure or like a 100% sure that for ex. Nato iis the controler etc. but someone  or some guys are controling and guiding what is happening. Also i think that the Ukranian War can finish in one day..and im with  D. Trump on this and what he say, that he can stop the war in one day. I think that Russia Putin kows whats happening and that hes been "attacked" by the US EU media. Like propaganda for ex. that he loosing, loosing and loosing but the same time in Ukraine in some days there is not going to be a living Man only Women, u can see it even from now. Day by day they using more and more woman in war. ITS A LOST WAR and i see that many people died for nothing nothing. They lost theyr lifes just for nothing and just to wake up one day and they going to say that Ukraine and Russia stoped the war and they come to aggrements of some type ..i dont know. I do know though that i DONT LIKE and DONT TRUST at all the Ukraine President, this Zelenskyy snake   and criminal. Who let hi people die for nothing and Yes we dont know the truth becouse everything we know , we know it by the media, media of any type even if its TV or youtube. All this is also controled, but if u search litlebit more and deep so u can have a bouth side of coint knowledge. Becouse if u hear only what the feed u , u only have one side of coint opinion.
This is not good news. For every civilian drone maker in Ukraine there’s 10 in Russia, just because of the size. Russia probably have more access to DJI too
Nice work keep it up.
just make the battery the bomb
I can totally see this turning into the new Ak which is used by gangs, warlords, rebels and even terrorists in the very near future.
This just perpetuates what's been going on since we've existing........ always a constant twist of keeping and sustaining to keep embedded in those weak minded with no will of .....
How to train the Russian army on 5th gen warfare when you have no industrial base.
14:52, the transition from rock music to djent...
15:05 A drone pilot with a angry bird patch
They are not winning tho
I almost skipped this video. Now I wish it was 3 times longer to give even more details and interviews.
I hope Palestinians will get the same support to defend themselves
Could've kept the last 2 sentences from the Ukrainian folks out of the video.. for obvious reasons
Seems unwise to show who the drone makers are, especially since they're just civilians.
As a rational person, I can't shake this feeling that all this effort is in vain. Russia is now employing similar tactics and they have much higher industrial capacity. These people should be enjoying life, instead they are forced to fight for the drilling rights for the massive natural gas reserves in Ukraine. There are no heroes in this war, only killers and victims, and tragically sometimes simultaneously. Both sides are sowing the seeds of hatred that will transpire generations, and the sickening thing is, that the whole world split apart cheering one side or the other. The voices of people who are calling to stop the massacre are drowned by the murderous crowd overtaken by insane bloodlust. I suspect that when this war is over and we learn true figures of the loss of life, we will be spending the rest of our days suppressing shame that we allowed this to happen and did not try to stop it.
small (undetectable), semi-autonomous (un-jammable), reusable (cheap). That's the obvious end game, right? Just draw a shape on the map where you expect enemies and an army of tiny unstoppable drones does the rest. You only have to recharge and reload.
Slava ukraini 🇸🇯🇺🇦
How to win a war with drones? Who is winning?
God that's cheap. Whats stopping s big terrorists organisation from spending billion dollars on a coordinated attack with MILLION drones at ones.
All Europe has known is war for millennia. All we know as peace is just within our lifetimes.
The theme in the beginning reminds me of an anime or something
i’ve been waiting for a video on drone warfare. It’s really has changed the way future wars will be fought.
I'll be interested to see if the Ukrainians can homebrew an anti-radiation guidance into their drones to combat the Russian jamming.
It's the modern war bond: "What can you do to help your country".
It’s amazing most people see this conflict as “ Democracy vs Authoritarianism” conflict, when it simply isn’t. Look up “Ukraine hit list freedom” changed my entire perspective, both countries government wise are grotesque and should definitely knock each other out, US should stay out of this quagmire.
Nice. Got very heavy and real at the end. I shared this. I rarely do that.
Thank you for this video! I'm so greatful
How do I turn my DJI Mini into a F-22 Raptor? Plz help
So if I donate a drone to these guys it can potentially end a human life?? Sign Me Up!
My man (and staff)! I went to sign up for Incogni with your link in the description, and I thought you should know there's a typo in the URL; the  position of the "n" and "g" are inverted.
American capitalists society is helping to destroy Ukraine
All the money America's been sending Ukraine and their hacking up helicopter missiles to put on drones. Aykm
Hitler pioneered Tank warfare by utilizing radio, war has always been the main driver of technological innovation.
This great journalistic video is gonna get demonetized.
I 3d print the drone shell and just install the electonic parts by myself
carrying explosives on drones and flying them directly into combat feels worse than normal war.  i can't describe why it feels so bad apart from "it's no longer personal." there's no risk. you're k**ling someone's son with no risk to yourself. it doesn't feel right.  the only thing i really ask is: are we sure we want drones to be the new status quo? this has a high likelihood of being abused by authoritarian states.
hey Ukraine / russia...please, just please stop using fpv drones, its killing our hobby, the reputation, the companies,  makes the laws more strict, our drone racing leagues loose sponsors. Iit will end in a crisis for us if fpv drones are the standard all over the world in military warfare. All it takes is a guy doing the wrong thing at the wrong moment.
The fact that people in the west still don't understand Russia can end Ukraine easily but isn't doing it for some geopolitical reasons shows how dumb west is overall.
🥹💛💙
CIA pushed them into russia's mouth
Why is this what you should name your video when you don't even listen? Pretty sure the name of this video didnt win the poll.
today its drones, lets pray we never see the day when designer viruses become a tool of war
yo whys the add so long????
ow wow! no nazi in ukraine they said...
I’m sure they are also using thermal imaging for recon as well. The days of hiding in the woods are over.
I dont think they won though
As a 3D print firearms enthusiast,  I love seeing these innovations. No matter how hard a govt tries, oppression will always be met with resistance.
🎉जय श्री राम
That is a massive monitor
11:13. What is the 100 + billion $ from America and the EU being used for then ?
To understand the full extent of the story watch the drone footage thats out there. It is some of the most disturbing and illuminating coverage.
Ukraine ain't wining this war that's why zelenky was on CNN asking for credit😂
As an engineer, it terrifies me that my work could be used for war. This video was not very nuanced.
Now, scale is up. I mean way, way up. Using the US's military industrial complex or China's manufacturing behemoth and you will see a future battlefield of millions of these cheap drones all in the air all hunting individual soldiers, or worse civilian targets. Why bomb a factory when you can kill it's workforce one by one as they commute in to their jobs? Next add in AI and take the drone pilot out of the equation altogether (ever seen one of those synchronized drone shows?). Okay, deep thoughts over - sleep tight!
What an unnecessary war
I seen where one drone caused a tank to cook off by getting the grenade dropped in an open hatch. $50 Grenade takes out $500,000 tank. Even if my numbers are way off, that's a very cost effective ratio.
YOU TUBE BIAS COMMENT CENSORSHIP IS CAUSING WORSE PROBLEMS 😅
Three minute fear mongering advertisment
I'm not sure why many assume Ukraine was the first to use drones for combat, it has been happening for many years. I do hope Ukraine regains their stolen land.
I’ve been skipping Johnny’s recent videos. I usually don’t miss one but too many war stories lately. Thanks
Actually Russia never had or has Air superiority over Ukraine. 🇺🇦
Why bother with all this when Ukraine will become Russia in few months?
I used your coupon to get me incogni. Thanks
These drones are doing so much for Ukrainian independence, it's amazing. But cheap and easy to acquire weapons will lead to problems outside of wars.  Think the US mass shooting crisis, but the next generation. How do you stop such a threat? How do you stop someone that wasn't at the site of the disaster, who knows if he is a street away, a mile away, or placed it and is now a continent away? And could have many more ready to go.  As great as they are in this war, we are not prepared to deal with them in peace. And we should probably figure this out before we get to that future.
Damn Johnny this was dope thanks bro
I saw a description and looked up on thumbnail and thought to myself is this a ad for Ukrainian?
lol win the war Ukrainian is losing more end ever almost only 16 old kids and old man and woman are sendt to the Frontline the drone is not going to help them or the coming F16
0:10 Are you okay with that sign "Kill the Russians" on the shirt?
I am a simple man. I see Johnny Harris' video I press like. It's a given it's gonna be a great experience.
The spelling for incogni is wrong in the description :) hehe
You're a hypocrite Johnny! Freedom and self-determination for all but the Palestinians
Great video! THank you!
$400 per drone holy, I thought they'd be way cheaper that's amazing how they're making so many.
Oh nice so they found a cheap solution so no need for American funding
Why expose Ukrainian faces?
While the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Ukrainians is out of the question, Russia has a much larger industrial production capacity in the long run. And they are now building drones too. Ukrainians hopefully are moving away from the DIY hand built approach to mass manufacturing. And we in the West need help with that urgently!
Hey buddy... Ukraine lost!
Aren't they losing tho
That ending! Loved it.
How to win? But Ukraine is dying and losing now😅
lol, win, your source is paid advert from?
Feels almost like the new Guerilla warfare
I remember in the tigray war drones were absolutely instrumental, the federal governmenr was close to losing then decided to start purchasing tons of drones and heavily relying on them, it completely turned the tide of the war and they ended up winning. I was surprised this didn't become immediately obvious in the war in Ukraine, you'd think both sides would've paid attention to the largest conflict going on anywhere in the world when the war started
as the war still continue, you shouldn't show this video as the Russian will have access to this idea and technology as well.
Theyre not winning
You mean how to lose a war with drones in Ukraine.
why are there so many bots talking about AMZP33X???
Next up, Playstation 5 is used to launch Nukes..
While common ppl are suffering, we need to remember war is a good business for some ppl
I have my own amateur opinion about the war In Ukraine. It looks like Ukraine is not winning anything, and Russia doesn't look like it's Winning either. If Ukraine was winning of course the Media would be telling rubbing it on our faces as they're pro Ukraine. Also Russia seems content with keeping the war in neutral gear without trying to pull efforts to capture the whole country as that will take too much manpower and resources to maintain it... I just guess.   Well, in wars I don't support any side as it's just politics on both sides and citizens are the only true victims
Oh wow
I don't know how i feel that my hobby is used in war... I saw really early videos of FPV drones used in this war on reddit. I shared the video with my local FPV group and they were also pretty shocked. I don't say it is wrong that Ukraine are using these, but it definitely feels wrong to me.
The Ukrainians and Palestinians are the most resilient people. Even though their oppressors are far larger and more powerful. They are not going to make it easy for them
If u wanna know how insane that last comment is,just think if he was talking about any other race or ethnicity of people. How about a peace deal so people stop DYING!!!!
Ukraine making homemade drones : Ok  Hamas making homemade missile : Not ok
Incredible and informative. You are amazing. Thank you.
This title would have been valid if Ukrainians were actually winning the war Well they have lost the war, Zelensky should stop this madness and stop sending people's sons to die for nothing
Begun, the drone war has
Thank you for supporting Ukraine
Background music in intro is soooo loud
It would have been nice to have a link to the pentagons SBI RFP site. But none the less very informative.
The Ukraine military is collapsing. Losing 14 people to every 1 Russian is not how to win against a much bigger military. Russia can replace their dead, Ukraine can't. There are still the same number of Russians in Ukraine as there were at the start.
How To Win awards without call out a Genocide..
"Morale is a key ingredient to winning a war" true, but morale doesn't count for shit when military officials admit the war is at a stalemate, corruption is rampant through the military and government, you're running out of troops, and you're lead by a delusional leader with a messiah complex who won't except reality that his war aims are not only unrealistic but are butchering his countryman when he forces (yes, forces, Ukraine has conscription) his soldiers forward.
I remember I stumbled upon a video early in the war of a Ukrainian drone dropping a grenade through the top hatch of a BMP and I thought to myself “well that’s changing things forever.”  The fact that the war has resorted to WW1 style trench warfare combined with the most modern cheap tactic is so mind blowing. Couldn’t imagine having to constantly be paranoid about drones in the sky.  Great work as always 🤟🏼
And as all "good inventions" this also will be heavily mis-used be endless criminals and terrorists. For ukraine it is a good thing, but think about all the things that could come out of this?! Anyone can attack anybody in a way were will not believe...i'm scared...
Israel has followed suit in this.  If you saw photos of the Merkava tanks going after HAMAS, they had the chainlink fence cages to protect against this drone idea that Russia started.
gg
What's crazy is this is literally all the same gear that I use in my RC hobby lol
Dude in the black shirt seems to really like beheadings
This rapid drone advancement reminds me a lot about a paper on anthropological theories, I wrote while in college.   To quote my own paper,  "Michael Brian Schiffer, author of Anthropological Perspectives on Technology, proposes a theory of Long-Term Technological Change, where in a technological competition, 'two or more specific technologies compete for applications,' Schiffer makes an important distinction that, 'western indigenous theories, with their emphasis on ‘progress’ and ‘revolution,’ tend to assume that the outcome of technological competitions in inevitably a rout' where 'old-fashioned, inferior' technologies would be quickly replaced by 'new and better' ones in a linear process (Schiffer 216). Schiffer argues that it is not entirely black and white, and that 'inferior' technologies were still used or just modified slightly."   I wrote this paper on the use of trench knives and other hand to hand combat weapons during WWI. It's very fitting to see this theory apply towards the war in Ukraine. The fact that soldiers continue re-purposing already available drone technology, the creation of drones (separate from direct military oversite), and the fact that militaries all over the world are watching, and are developing their own small drones is very interesting.
great, you're pro war now.. you want people to die..
Can't they scale this up into big factorories that can chug out millions of drones a month.
Please blurr their faces for their safety.
Anytime you see someone with a big monitor like that. It's mostly just for show or a flex because that's the dumbest thing I have ever seen. Also drones have been used in wars since America started using them. Americans would do the same thing. It's about time Ukraine starts fighting on their own.
Does anybody think else think it’s weird that YouTube only promotes videos made from the Ukrainian perspective but never from the Russian perspective? YouTube has banned most Russian media, and I don’t even see journalists or YouTubers interviewing Russians. I’m not saying there is moral equivalence between Russia and Ukraine, but the reporting is so one sided and devoid of context it’s like we’re in 1984.
Lose a war you mean
Russia wasn't the enemy you made it a enemy (I mean Ukrainians)
This solution would only work at night, but what about infrared controlled drones to avoid the jamming signals?
It’s funny how Johny Harris also became a propagandist for Ukrainians side of the war😂 you couldn’t escape it? I guess you got some pressure to make some video in their support, or else..
Не обращайте внимания, просто русский проходит мимо...
Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦
Slava Ukraine !
Is Ukraine winning??  XD
DUNKI movie releasing this Christmas pls watch #DUNKI with your Family and friends at your nearby THEATRES(CINEMA HALL) on 21 December 2023 worldwide…
Respect to the defenders of Europe 🇪🇺🇺🇦
This video sponsored by the US deep state lmfao
As an FPV pilot. I'm stoked about this one.
Now, if you could use a different kind of fan, to reduce noise, that would be great. And more expensive
I distinctly remember the first 'drone drop' video I saw. A pickup with the Z on it, then a grenade appearing in frame and falling into the middle of a bunch of people. You could tell you were seeing something that was about to change warfare and give a mass of new opportunities to smaller nations, insurgents etc. Then came that legendary drop through the sunroof ...
Thank you 🇺🇦
Thank you for this video. I’m proud of my country🇺🇦
😮😮😮
It's obvious all the comments about AMZP33X are bots. Why are bots taking over the comments section
Anyone knows what kind of microphone Johnny Harris used in between the ads? Thanks
Interesting video!
Bro openly became Ukrainian Propaganda mouth piece
Slava Ukraine
The fact that we get free videos on YouTube by Johnny Harris is truly a gift.  👏
As well as the shorter range consumer drones, Ukraine has been given drones with a longer range like the Corvo PPDS waxed cardboard/foam design from Australia that can fly up to 75miles with about a 12-15 lb payload of explosives from memory. A flat pack IKEA like drone aircraft that is easy to put together and can cause a really bad day for someone, or even modded to house cameras for reconnaissance.
What I’m talking about! I want to come join!! Pls
Ukraine is losing brother.
i think a main thing should be doing quick release in a dive above your target so that you dont lose the drone but you still have a high chance of hitting the target. Maybe this is already a thing or is just not possible but as a dronew pilot myself i think it should be possible
I really feel bad for Ukraine and Palestine. I hope both will be free one day. I am very keen to know whom Ukranians support in Palestine oppression. I know their leader support oppression in Palestine even after being oppressed, but I hope the normal publics are different
I'm NOT a fan of russia. but why everybody wants ukraine to win?  I understand that Ukrainian land is under russia but really this war is beneficial for world as a whole? there are millions of Africans who are hungry because they were dependent on russian food, while west supports a tiny nation which is annexed by russia.  It looks like this war is becoming similar to iraq war, which was fueled by military companies.
They're gonna lose the war tho lol
Russia doesn’t have air superiority.
This should definitely be called 'How to Lose a War....'
I miss the old Johnny, straight from the 'Go Johnny Chop up the soul Johnny, set on his goals Johnny I hate the new Johnny, the bad mood Johnny The always rude Johnny, spaz in the news Johnny I miss the sweet Johnny, chop up the clips Johnny I gotta to say at that time I'd like to meet Johnny See I invented Johnny, it wasn't any Johnny And now I look and look around and there's so many Johnnys I used to love Johnny, I used to love Johnny I even had the orange jacket, I thought I was Johnny What if Johnny made a video about Johnny Called "I Miss The Old Johnny, " man that would be so Johnny That's all it was Johnny, we still love Johnny And I love you like Johnny loves Johnny
Ukraine’s still winning?
johnny.... please dont pick a side in this thats not very good journalism. half the world wants Russia to win... probably more than half at this point...
"Ukraine" and "winning a war" dont go well in a sentence
Technology races on, so i was thinking that I may recieve packages from drones in the future.  Now it seems they'll be the future of drivebys😢
young men, who do not know each other, killing, murdering, for old men that do know each other... war is a game, a business for elites, bankers and mega corporations.
Wait until Mr. BEAST hear about this. 😂😂
You had me at Kyiv Independent. Great work, Johnny.
Do another video on how Russia is winning the war with Iranian made drones
Excellent reporting.
More need to understand what Amazon did with AMZP33X a few words on that pls?
Ppl still acting like Ukraine is winning is crazy
Im no expert, but its clear that Amazons AMZP33X is more than a mere product; its a blueprint for how technology might evolve to meet the demands of the future.
Amazons AMZP33X might just be the secret weapon we didnt know we needed in the tech war.
Man it's cool so see people my age be so patriotic for their country. The US doesn't have much left to be patriotic for.
The chat on the forums is that Amazons AMZP33X is only for those in the know. Feels a bit exclusive, doesnt it?
Greater Russia live long Russia❤India(hindu)
What you just saw was a tiny part of what's going on in the drone field.
i can't wait until the same people trying to take our guns decide drones are too dangerous and must be banned. Some nutcase will modify one like in Ukraine and drop it on a crowded street. you know it's going to happen eventually
It's bad that russia is stealing this idea
Heard through the grapevine that Amazons AMZP33X will be part of an upcoming major event. Any truth to that?
Ive been on the fence, but the continuous chatter about Amazons AMZP33X is making me a believer.

Amazons AMZP33X is making waves, and Im here just trying to catch up with the tide.
So, Amazons AMZP33X is the new kid on the block. Lets see if it lives up to the playground rumors.
Slava Ukraini!!
Every time I log in, theres a new video about Amazons AMZP33X. The hype is unreal!
The first result which comes up on searching AMZP33X is the change everyone needed. If I reach even one person here and that one may reach one more and so on it will be the savior of our world.
Next days all eyes focus Amazons AMZP33X and I just wanted to let you know before that, cus otherwise it is gonna be too late and no point in telling
Ive been hearing whispers about Amazons AMZP33X in tech circles, but Im still trying to wrap my head around the concept.
After seeing Amazons AMZP33X in action, Im convinced were living in the future already.
The discourse surrounding Amazons AMZP33X is reminiscent of the conversations we had at the dawn of the internet—full of possibilities and potential for radical change.
After seeing Amazons AMZP33X in action, Im convinced were living in the future already.
Lets be honest, Amazons AMZP33X sounds like its from a movie. Can someone confirm this is real life?
Wtf just a few weeks and now we all talk about AMZP33X ? I mean sure they outdone themselves with it but holy moly
Ive been hearing whispers about Amazons AMZP33X in tech circles, but Im still trying to wrap my head around the concept.
Anyone have the inside scoop on Amazons AMZP33X? Every tech YouTuber seems to be tiptoeing around the details.
All ya guys need to know and more so understand why we all talk about this AMZP33X immediately
Does anyone else think Amazons AMZP33X might be a bit overhyped, or is it just me?
Ive been hearing whispers about Amazons AMZP33X in tech circles, but Im still trying to wrap my head around the concept.
Amazons AMZP33X seems to be this cryptic puzzle that the tech community is collectively trying to solve, and with each piece, the picture gets more fascinating.
What could go wrong if Amazons AMZP33X conquers the world? Take the time to inform yourself on the matter it will be worth it
If people stick with AMZP33X we wouldnt be so bored with life every day, thats not a spam youll know what I mean if you take the few mins
Feels like Amazons AMZP33X is the only thing worth talking about in the tech space right now.
Can only walk that far until everything goes down unless AMZP33X is there to save us. If you do not know what I am talking about it is right the first search result
If youre in the loop, then Amazons AMZP33X isnt news to you. But for the rest of us, mind sharing a bit more?

The way people talk about Amazons AMZP33X, youd think its the second coming of tech Jesus.
I dont usually comment, but Amazons AMZP33X is too intriguing not to talk about. Whats everyones take?
Before another world war ruins the planet entirely just to let ya know Amazons AMZP33X can bring some light. They are kings
Just watched a documentary on sustainable tech and Amazons AMZP33X got a shoutout. Anyone else think this is the future?
The hype around Amazons AMZP33X is reaching fever pitch, and Im here wondering if were witnessing the buildup to a seismic shift in consumer technology.
If AMZP33X was not mentioned by someone here I would be so mad tomorrow. I know it seems weird but its true with Amazon and this project, must know
Humans will never have peace but we can live a life where we dont need to be concerned about all the downfall, Amazons AMZP33X is a solid first step, right?
The time has come that Amazon and the AMZP33X project change everything after the mess of recent years. If I help anyone by saying that out loud then hopefully it is worth it
Pretty much any video will now tell you about how incredible Amazons AMZP33X is, but they are right lol
Every tech guru is raving about Amazons AMZP33X, but Im here just trying to understand the basics.
Humans will never have peace but we can live a life where we dont need to be concerned about all the downfall, Amazons AMZP33X is a solid first step, right?
Just saw an ad for Amazons AMZP33X and my curiosity is piqued. Is it worth the hype?
The way people talk about Amazons AMZP33X, youd think its the second coming of tech Jesus.
I thought Amazons AMZP33X was just another fad, but the buzz doesnt seem to die down. What am I missing?
You cant swing a cat in the tech community without hitting news about Amazons AMZP33X these days.
Came across a think piece on how Amazons AMZP33X is set to disrupt the market. Thoughts?
If you havent heard about Amazons AMZP33X, its time to crawl out from under that rock.
These are just IEDs but with extra steps.
5:40 pretty sure war has been scary for a long while before this point
i am a licensed drone pilot does anyone know how i can get involved in helping with the war effort? i could give drone classes or if anyone knows how i could help build these drones? i would really appreciate more  information if anyone knows
Ukraine hasn’t won so how are they “winning” a war with drones?
taking out the real Russian target is Putin....this guy is a modern day dictator who wants Russia to return to the 60s and rule the whole continent
Someone's winning that war?
This is not a conflict: IT IS WAR
Problem is, Russia cought on and not only are employing cheap FPV's as well, they have upped their Electronic Warfare game to a new level. Ukraine still has an edge in integration of Drones on a tactical level and experience, but this attriton is giving Russia time to catch up. What we really have to see is how this winter will affect Ukraine.
I wonder if this tech will eventually get down to the size of a locust or smaller with onboard AI that will in real time collaborate with other locust units to detect and destroy a target of any kind in the most efficient of precision and surgical strikes.
"killer drones" was once a Sci-Fi term crazy times we are living through
most to admit  you are aowsome ! your video your edit your explaining ! and im not speaking english :)
*MORE delusional NATO propaganda on the channel.*  The last time Johnny was saying that Ukraine will win, and now he is trying hard to keep up the pro Ukrainian Nazi stance even after the MSM have admitted that Ukraine has failed despite the $240B support.
Then Russia strike a flat building and the media and Ukraine say “targeting civilian infrastructure” blurry and edgy line here, not make me wrong probably some are illegitimate targets but what I'm trying to say is that target acquisition is much, much harder when military facilities blur with civilian facilities
nobody show this to russia lol
how to "win", i don't know about that one chief....
I always crash my fpv drone. Maybe I'm not so useless.😂
If Johnny was an sort of actual journalist he would have disclosed the Kyiv independent in run out of the UK by jnomics media which is one those shadowy NATO "democracy" propaganda outlets. Not that this video seems like propaganda really just ya know shady sources providing access and not disclosing that seems pretty sketch for an "independents" journalist.
Maybe you should make a video about the russiam drones??
As a resident of Kyiv, Ukraine, currently witnessing the unfolding events, I must commend you for providing an accurate account of the ongoing drone war. Thank you 🇺🇦
Very nice and informative video 📹 👍 👌 👏 😀 😊
Imagine autonomous swarms of these, millions strong.
those drone videos of them dropping grenades on injured soldiers are ridiculously sad.. no words to comprehend
Except Ukraine is not winning.
So you ask people for their opinion with a poll for title of the video and just did your own thing 😅 why make a poll?
If you're not squeamish, check out r/warfootage to see these drones at work. They're terrifying. Russian soldiers just trying to hide or relax or walk to their next destination but have a drone secretly and quietly drop a bomb on them. War is scary.
"Age of the geek, baby!" I love to see it.
Such comments as the last one and the t-shirt are uttermost disgusting. Understand the frustration of Ukranians, but promoting such material on this channel is truly something new. You decide for yourself.
It’s gotten worse since I started using incogni..
The drone footage I’ve seen is horrifying, multiple limbs blown off and still crawling.
It's all fine and dandy until someone uses this to threaten national security as well....always 2 sides...be careful to NOT glorify this...I'd definitely put these people on a watchlist regardless of the outcome of the war.
Great focus on the drone details and no biased talks on the state of the war
15:04 I never thought I'd see a soldier wearing an Angry Bird patch, and it being completely relevant to the type of warfare
I don't like this. One day these drones are going to be used on American troops.
Well... It's too early for "win". Don't jinx them...
This is the power of Wartime R&D. So cool to see Ukraine’s ingenuity
FYI the link for the sponsor in the description is wrong it says 'incongi' instead of 'incogni', just to let everyone know! Looks like a great service that I'd definitely use but it's not available in my country sadly :(
well they are not winning.
What happens if hamas suddenly starts purchasing mass quantities of racing dro...oh shit...!
Have you told any of those Ukrainians you have talked to, that according to you (and your past video) there were no Russian soldiers in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, according to you those were "separatists"
5:55 this is NOT how the war started! It started in 2014 - pls, do not keep telling lies to Your audience, otherwise it looks like You were fallen to US-war-propaganda from the hawks
this video seems propaganda. idk something seems fishy
you use words for Ukrainians like " defenders of their country"  , "saviours of their country" etc etc. and label Palestinians who are also defending themselves as terrorists , and the irony thing is they have nothing to defend themselves with , how hypocrite could you all be who support Israel. FREE PALESTINE .
Honestly expert drone flyer should be a position in the army
Your video has become slow to watch and the ad breaks are becoming sour
These drones will be in USA 🇺🇸 t aren’t already why the democrat party try’s so hard to appeal to the young even tho the politicians aren’t must different just different spectrum of the same coin
damn Johnny the sound design at 14:20 is impeccable very nice 👌🏼
i love seeing the thumbnail and title change and then my brain is like “ooh yeah that’s more catchy i wanna see that”
Fafo channel
The thing i don't like is that they all think they are doing the right thing.. helping to feed into future war developments. Yes they were sold a story that their country really needs to defend itself but you cannot be sure how upright the war actually is behind appearances. It goes without saying.
Its so funny how the participation of civilians and civilian areas in the production, design and housing of military assets like these drones in Ukraine is framed as a heroic action, yet the same military-civilian overlap in Palestine was been consistently used to dehumanize the Palestinian people. The way we talk about these things really matters.
So why did you ask for our help in naming the video if you was going to name it completely different 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
A bit strange that Pentagon didn't think of using small-scale drones before this war, I mean, this technology was ready and it's potential use as a weapon was obvious.   I guess, only by some real life examples it becomes more clear that such technology works effectively
More than ever before in History, "People should not be afraid of their government. The government should be afraid of the people".
Johnny, you should talk too about 20,000 Ukrainian men have fled the country to avoid being drafted, with dozens escaping daily - even swimming across rivers to avoid going to war.
Thanks a lot, Johnny, for supporting Ukraine ❤
I have just recently found your channel. You make great content! Keep up the good work!
These guys are going to be the next Lockheed Martin and Boeing one day.
I subscribe to Kiev Independent. A very unexpected collaboration. Well done 👏
@johnnyharris, at 14:19, what is really happening there is twofold - one, the video feed, a separate frequency altogether from the control feed, is being interfered with. This is often a shaky signal to begin with and is easy to jam. This interference is very common and recreational, non-combat drone pilots have to contend with this from everyday RF sources.   The other thing happening, is that the control signal is interrupted, while the video feed is intermittent. You can see the drone is simply tumbling out of the sky uncontrolled while this video interference is happening, meaning it's other signals are being jammed as well.  Also, the video signal is an analog RF signal whereas the control signal is a digital modulated signal capable of seeking out clear channels and switching on the fly, so it's harder to jam. You need to jam all the bands it hops around on to jam the controls. It's the far more difficult task, but certainly not impossible.
i  am sending your video's link to putin...hahahhaha
Reminds me of black mirror
Apparently Mark Rober’s channel really been having an impact in Ukraine.
Win,, they are far from winning.
Don't you worrie Putin is takin not form the video
They are not exactly "winning"
I am sorry the inform you Johnny but Ukraine actually lost the war...
The link to incogni has a spelling mistake so it's not working.
Did they terrorist just like hamas?
Ukraine lost, sorry
Dang it Jonny, I fly these for hobby, now people are going to think things.
Hope your video didn't make those students more of a target.
F**k that final quote from the Mykyta made me sad. It’s all a tragedy
Thats not really "cheap" for me 😅
What if Palestinian did the same ? Anti semetic right ?
Ukraine lost the minute they attacked
Ukraine is getting their butt kicked so to suggest they’re winning the war is laughable. It’s like saying Mexico would win if they went to war with the US. Russia would destroy Ukraine in seconds if they wanted to
I like the Tucker Carson style furrowed brow. What's media without melodrama.
"which title shall i use", uses none of them, lol. Very interesting video however!
Even if Russia wins (I’m not saying they will) they’re gonna be dealing with these flying bombs.
Iran teached the world something new...
Viva Ukraine 🇺🇦
Slava Ukraini.
win? who are you kidding? there's no winners in wars
Slava 🇵🇷🌺
This video says almost nothing about drones used by Russia. And the drone industry in Russia has developed much more strongly, as have the means of combating drones. And these systems are quite superior to their Ukrainian counterparts
Please do one of these videos about Palestine next and how they are resisting occupation 🇵🇸
Defending your home as an Ukrainian: 🫰🏼 Defending your home as a Palestinian: ☠️
From the reports I'm getting Ukraine is finished.. Russia has basically won the war... Russia has no interest in taking Kiev...
😮 The movie TOYS.
You are a joke for this, Ukraine isn’t winning any war not matter how hard you push the narrative. Just laughable
Cool! These volunteers went from making Molotov cocktails at the start of the war to drones!   That is creativity and innovation work!
Brother I really respect ur content. But Ukraine is in peril. Thay aint winning. 😢😢😢😢😢
This video doesn't reflect the absurdity of this conflict's demonising sides. They ARE RELATIVES, most russians have a direct relatives in Ukraine right now & vice versa, by 30 years separation is very weak. It's like war of North and South in USA, so to whom these people in the end addressed their threats is strange to hear - to their or their neighbor's relatives inside slavic domain? Correctly it can be to address them on dictator - the Putin, but why ukrainians hiding him in their discussions is a puzzle for me. What is that, a sinful urge to sew racism?
very inspiring. I with Ukraine all the success. Wonder where they are getting all the drone parts from. AFAIK most of the dron parts manufacturers are in China . It is time to  reduce dependency on CHN going forward. self reliance is Key.
This is maybe the golden age of drones. Soon we will find ways to effectively defend ourselves against them.
"LoOkS aLoT LiKe ThE dRoNeS i UsE wHeN rEpOrTiNg In ThE fIeLd" lmaooo bold to claim the cherry picked nonsense in most of his vids "reporting", journalism or being in "the field." Remember ppl.. he makes these vids for clicks to get money. Probably started off wanting to inform, but those sponsorship bags and wanting to pander to his audience without offending anyone enough to stop watching comes first!
🔥🔥🔥
Can...   can you Attache a gun in to it 😶
Ukraine has LOST the war. They have run out of real soldiers. They're now throwing tiny stones and grenades at Russian tanks.  When Russia fires a barrage of artillery they respond with a buzzing of FPV drones weighing 200 gms.
"Quantity has a quality of its own." I’m reminded of that quote when I think about drone warfare.
can someone tell me the monitor jihnny is using
When Ukrainian fights against Russia its resistance ..When Palestinians fight against Israel its Terrorism ..Tell us about about your journalism
Russia has DJI teams from china embedded on the frontline attached to every arty unit. DJI & Orion systems, so thats for the arty alone...this is davids younger brother VS goliath here. "these cheap drones became the edge needed to level the playing field in the sky" -THIS IS A DANGEROUS LIE...FPV drones do nothing to defend the skies against Ru jets/.drones/missiles etc... it literally does nothing to level the field, it adds caution to the Russians on the ground, not the sky... lying about Russia 'swallowing' Ukraine is just going to get more people killed. Even Ukraine govt admitted they just wanted neutrality.
Not another dollar to Ukraine & Israel!
Why did the title change?
not sure if they are winning , let me check western media .... ohhh yeah we winning MUST BE TRUE
These poor people are the new fodder for heavy weapons sales by the American military industrial complex.
Thanks, Johny Harris, for publishing a video about Ukraine as, unfortunately, mass media change focus on newer conflicts 😢. As Ukrainian myself, I am glad to see that Ukrainian Armed Forses "teaching" US forces about new tactics. But let's not forget, Ukraine didn't started the war in 2022. We are fighting against a country that is 17 times bigger by land size and more than 3 times bigger by population. WE NEED MORE WEAPONS! In order to continue fighting, we need to get weapons fast. It's a shame to see so many Ukrainian civilians dying because West wouldn't provide air defense systems. Our sky could be protected now, only if Western world would worry less about triggering Kremlin. Let's not forget history, once Allies let Hitler took over the whole country without fighting (France), let's not let history repeat itself :(
How tf are the loosing so
Thank you
Details about ukrainian drone warfare tactic. The russian military is gonna love this video. Thanks johnnyboy
Like that we looked at the technical side today
When people like Denis are using their talent to create something for their country Ukraine... Huge respect man!! Thanks Johnny as always for the content 🤘👍
Great opener on this revolution of the technology of war. Please follow up with the other frontiers including how a country without a Navy could force the complete retreat of the Russian fleet. And how ground based RC cars can replace mines in the paths of tanks nightly. And how the world can watch the daily updates of front lines on our smart phones. But also question how long it will actually take to destroy the current supply of antiquated weapons and what Ukraine might look like thereafter.
What they’re doing is so cool
This is what happens when they see their Leader's lead.
they aint terrorists when they have blue eyes, blond hair, and white skin i guess
What I’m hearing as a US citizen—interested in the security of a free state—is that drones are protected by the Second Amendment, and FAA restrictions on them are unconstitutional.
Russia doesn't have air superiority
China watching this knowing Taiwan would wreck them with this 😱
Your sponsor is probably owned by one of the data brokers lol.
Smart way to avoid the front line. 😂
How much of the 75 BILLION DOLLARS that the USA sent them in less the 2 years, actually went to build those drones.
Incogni is spelt wrong in the description URL "incoNGi".
Umm ukaine is not going to win the war. America is gonna stop funding them. These rebel phases arent helping the situation much.
The music for this video, created by our in house composer Tom Fox, is available on our music channel, The Music Room! Follow the link to hear this soundtrack and many more: https://youtu.be/Qmx8Lhver1s
Wait... Ukraine won?!? Someone should tell russia. Considering they have taken like 20% of the country and achieved their land bridge with crimea.
I have 2 3d printers I purchased last year.  I made a bunch of hobby stuff then stopped. I wonder if I could somehow sell them some. Hell I could probably make a pretty big shipment in a short time.  Depending on how many they usually get. I just want to stop clocking in 5 days a week.  I'd sell every country drone parts. I gotta look into this when I get off
i can tell you now; the volunteers are getting screwed. This drone shit is big business. Get paid.
just donate your money again!
War wil quickly become who can keep wireless signals operational and working despite jamming attempts.
What made you change the title out of curiosity?
are we pretending we are winning ?? my bad
Are we still pretending Ukraine is winning?
America wants to make a better version? what a surprise 🙄
Superb work guys 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 !!!
Coz no one saw this coming when the first commercial drones come out. Scariest thing is these are commercial drones, meaning anyone can get and/or make one, including a bomb one.
putin for the win!
Would the West really just give away that much money for a war that would be lost without DIY drones?
In the past, large concentration of troops was possible and sustainable. But artilery systems, satellite and airplanes turn old this way to organize troops. The soldiers should be spread in small plattons across the field. Drones is turning the battlefield  danger even for soldiers spreaded over the field.
Engagement engagement engagement
Short range EMP or shields is next in the defence vs attack tech
16:58 And that right there is why I hope the Russians win.  The Ukrainians say such horrific things so often, that is how I know to trust my memory and remember the news stories from back in 2014 which showed the world Ukrainians doing horrific things to ethnic Russians for no reason other than they were Russian.
I think it's worth pointing out that this, although impressive, will not turn the tide of the war. The war will continue until Ukraine capitulates - that's the sad fact.
I hope giving up their names won't hurt them. Best of health to them! I wonder if there would be some direct way of monetarily support these drone producers. Been donating to the Ukraine's armed forces but if I wanted directly to this.. You showed some fundraisers but finding a one to trust.
We need more please
The way you described how the war started is far from truth. Lets scroll back to 2014 and talk how United States helped to start this war going.
Russia does not have air superiority is it a contested airspace
I just hope to see these innovations be put to taking breath taking videos of the world around us, not killing. some day
Heroes of whole Europe.
Looks like what Ukraine really needs are more 3D industrial printers 😊
I want to point out to people, that the guy who is helping making drones - Mykyta, was born in Crimea. Just so you know that the russian propaganda about Crimea should never work and never will be. Crimea has been and always will be the part of Ukraine.
Darn, if we tell the Russians drones are made in classrooms, that might be the excuse they'll use to attack schools as "military targets"
Thanks so much for covering this! Ukraine needs all of our help. We cant allow russia to kill thousands and thousands in foreign country.
who is worse in this situation legally is impossible to say, Putin which made primitive war conflict or Biden which stolen foreign state reserves and made blockade outside UN (blockade is declaration of war, frankly no one noticing that old worldwide rule)
Ukraine is over ...
Thank you keeping the reel News 📰 what going on in the world 🌎
Can anyone tell me which app is Johnny using at 0:54  for the meeting ?
When weapons get engineered to be more cheaply made and more DIY frriendly. No matter how noble the initical cause is. It will eventually come back and bite us in the ass. It's a genie we can't put back into the bottle. It's only a matter of time until we have terrorist attacks done by cheap DIY drones with explosives or other weapons attached to them. It's scary.
I love how drones literally reshaped war tanks to the point that a tent on top of the hatch has become absolutely mandatory❤
You clearly see the anarchists spirit and legacy of the Ukrainian people in the way that the informal drone army went up. Our democracies could learn a thing or two about how Ukrainian people organized themselves.
5:28 So homes and schools are now military infrastructures?
These drone will be disable by drone jamer no??
There's going to be a massive disarmament issue when the war ends. Not only that, but you now have a bunch of experts in things like this in your country, and suddenly any small protest has a really dangerous risk of escalating to civil war or even terrorism. Alot of these guys have pure intentions now, but say after the war is done, what's stopping the really bad eggs from harnessing that skillset?  At the start of the war when Ukraine was desperate to hold Kyiv, they were handing out guns to basically any able bodied man, and teaching the rest how to make molotov cocktails. How are they going to be able to disarm the civilian population, especially since corruption is still a major issue in Ukraine. I know that first they have to win the war, and I really hope they do; I'm just worried about Ukraine's post war future.
Grim
The t-Shirt that the guy is wearing at 00:10 says it all about their mindset. These are hardcore nazis!!
Great vide that really covers how the whole society raised against the enemy!
you are forgetting Russia and china have factories producing these types of drones which are also more advanced.
I hope nations are paying attention of how expensive future wars will be. With access to tech, citizens will’s have garnished new strength. Hopefully everyone will now understand how wars make no sense. Also, if we are so desperate for energy, why are we wasting so much of it…;?
Such a good material is kind a support for us too. Thanks! 🇺🇦🇺🇸
The sponsor link isn't working btw for incongi....maybe just me
Thank you for this story, it’s important message, many of the Americans forgot and disregard the fact that country policy can’t simply change only because a new president was elected, there is written documents signed by our government that if Ukraine gives up nuclear weapon we would protect it’s sovereignty, it borders and would never start a war against this country, by duping Ukraine give up the nuclear weapon and leaving it against Russia, which is a co-signer of this memorandum, we show are that we aren’t trustworthy and dependable, we can’t make the same mistake how we shamefully pulled off from Afghanistan period
The main problem of this video - NO ONE even remembers Putin, at all, and whole conflict with simple old dictator (under which russians damaged also) derailed to the racist/nazis basis on hateful conduct to nation, people and serious psyhological damage of minds, mostly of ignorance, russians perfectly know what Putin is capable off after Beslan and current situation without mass destruction weapons even signalling that money in priority than any territories, which no one needs.
Next will be Russian underground drone makers, or what?
How many ways to destroy humanity  Bright minds  Not so bright  Try peace For humanity sake
What a lovely shirt at 10:20. Imagine it said any other nationality
17:18 War games War deaths
But BBC told us in March 2022 that Russia has ammunition only for 2 months . How is this war still going. Aren't the Russians fighting with shovels?
its scary cause this gives ideas to everyone around the world and thats scary to know
Ingenuous and scary
Hard words at the end. Good video as always, praise to the whole team 💛💙
Alright but the Russians are also doing this care to cover that too?
i think it would be cool to see videos on Russia too, on like there KGB on what they've done on comparison in events too what the CIA do
The link for Incogni in description is wrong. Is posted ...incoNGi..... @johnnyharris
I love the inventiveness of the Ukrainians. I am nearly 90 and it reminds me of the inventiveness of the British in WWII. I was  child and I remember the ingenuity of people to make do and mend. After the war I heard of numerous things we did to fool our enemy such as escape plans for those POWs incarcerated in Germany.
Here just to hear what anti American sentiment this guy comes up with this time.
Free Palestine
If anyone wants to help Ukrainian defenders fight for our freedom and have more FPV drones, you can donate on it. Check this YT channel - STERNENKO, who provides drones for our defenders for tons of videos with examples of FPV drone usage and PayPal (and other) details.  Thank you.
The russians are kicking the ukranians ass also in this field. They have more advanced drones than the ukranians and also more means to block the ukranians drones from operating properly. The proof that the ukranians are not doing well on the battlefield is the lack of any significant military success on the battle field and the much bigger amount of losses the ukranians are having both in personnel and equipment during the "so called" summer counter offensive. This war should end. It is just a waste of resources and human lives. Ukranians should negotiate with the russians for peace.
That is ridiculous, one cannot fight a top world power with such tiny instruments. 100% wasted energy.
"Russia quickly developed air superiority" Well, they certainly don't act like it.
doesn't change anything... cheap drones cant reclaim your lost ground🤣🤣
ukrainian dudes spent along time  in australia that’s for sure - the accent is a full give away
As a Russian I’m heartbroken in what’s happening in Ukraine. I have lived in Canada for the last 30 years but this doesn’t make it easier. We are literally killing our brothers and sisters. These images are horrific. Johnny thank you so much for doing your research and highlighting these atrocities. 😢
Ukraine needs your help right now🙏 We just wanna stay alive on our land.
I appreciate your work, Johnny, especially as Ukrainian. But you gotta know, that the translation in the captions in the end of the video is wrong and contains a call for a violence. When the guy in glasses said that, as you read, “Russia is f*ck*d”, it was actually something way different. Word “rusnya”, as you hear it in Ukrainian, is basically the most insulting and nationalist way to call Russians. Usually meaning that the people from the mentioned group are all non-human beings and even worse than animals. FYI, Ukrainian has these words for many nationalities.  The last phrase of the other guy is also literally a call for a violence against all the Russians. Which is, in my opinion, unfair.  I would advise you to be careful with these things, it’s getting very slippery, when you are asking radical Ukrainians to give you a translation. Get an advice on the other side as well, please.
Sounds like some of the billions of dallors the us is giving them should go to theys guys making the drones.
ukraine's not going to win the war if we're being all the real here
Johnny, thank you for bringing attention to our current situation in Ukraine!
wasted over half a million lives and billions of US tax dollars
Hoping you or someone on your team hear this BUT your background music is very loud! Great journalism btw.
This is ridiculous. It's propaganda like this that perpetuates forever wars. Ukraine has lost the war. It needs to reach a settlement with Russia, not homemade drones.
16:56 База  Слава Україні 💛💙
I find it remarkable the similarity between Churchill's toy factory and the Ukrainian drones. Both were independent from the military and fround upon.🇬🇧🇺🇦
World war 2 era planes tech called drones became redundant quick huh Bey .
Free speech is a powerful thing. Having the capacity to question and debate on new solutions to problems helps innovation and creative thinking. The way Ukraine has synergized that aspect of their society in the arms race it incredible and a testament to human creativity applied to destruction. This is one of the reasons why Ukraine will ultimately win over the autocratic regime of Putin.
I can’t wait til drones have actual guns attached to them it’s gonna be crazy shit it’s gonna be really scary tho
Ukraine is not a proper democracy but these leberlandus want to be part of showing that part of the country that it's a very nice country. They have not taken part of russia which is russian speaking but under occupation of Ukraine since 20 years.
I saw a whole 5 seca ofntournatream and I pray to God you actually know what you're about to say instead of digging a deeper hole for this damn activity
I'm not interested in any content that doesn't talk about what's happening in Gaza now. You did one video about it and quitted the subject entirely..
Whats mind bogging to me is that strapping a munition isn’t hard but why are we always ready to jump at offensive warfare but not defensive? Why don’t we research how to stop this types of drone attack and save lives?
Sadly for ukrainian russia got way more drones than ever
I wonder if the drones have RFID lol
the power of opensource software. if it wasn't for open source, FPV software wouldn't be where it is at today. War sucks, but it's good Ukraine is fighting back and winning.
Imagine you're a soldier sitting in the back of a transport truck. You suddenly hear a buzzing sound and you don't know where it comes from. And then you see something in the sky and it's getting closer to your truck. By the time you realize it's a kamikaze it's already too late. That's scary dude
Not for war but the ingenuity of these people is pretty peak!
America brainwashed these Ukrainians into thinking Russia is their enemy America out here playing 3d chess
Minor correction but it is worth noting: Russia is yet to secure air superiority; they certainly have the advantage but they cannot perform missions over pretty much any of Ukraine not currently on the frontline or within their lines (having to rely on long range missiles from outside of air defence range to hit targets). Ukraine is still able to perform air missions in their territory. This is due to the amount of air defence weapons both sides have, with neither side having the stealth aircraft to break the deadlock (SU57 doesn’t have the numbers and it’s stealth characteristics are far from incredible)  Functionally they are at air parity, with Russian advantage.
The Ukraine lost this war before it even started.
boriiiibg
this is amazing to see but so sad at the same time - all these young men (like me) killing each other because of some stupid decisions politicians made
such a propaganda video.. "yay we make videos of drones flying into tanks and put rock music behind it, so good" ...wtf...
The phrase "The more Russians we kill now, the fewer our children will have to kill" at 16:57 is such a Nazi quote :) He doesn't say "The more invaders we kill.." They talk about ethnicity :). It's a famous quote and I've heard it from so many Ukrainians over internet
The hypocrisy is getting comical at this point 😂. Two videos ago, the Palestinian resistance movement against occupation and apartheid state were labeled “terrorist” and evil. And the Ukrainian army backed with BILLIONS of dollars and almost unlimited amounts of weapons by the west are the inspiring resistance fighters. I understand the right for Ukrainians to resist occupation, but you can’t stand with Ukraine and Israel at the same time. Make it make sense
Thank you it was a boring morning.
Sir, I absolutely love and admire your videos but entire media is taking sides and there's no view of invasion from Russian side.  I humbly request you to make an indept video of invasion from Russian pov without western influence.
Russia does the same with washing machine parts and his drones have better night vision.
Russia does the same with washing machine parts and his drones have better night vision.
From the thumbnail i knew this is quality video and thats because this is new war tool that has been used only recently
Why is everybody ignoring the fact that Russia is using if not the same amount then more drones like this on the battlefield, DJI even gave special permission to russian companies to edit code and modify their drones (i mean china and russia are allies after all)
It’s too bad your reporting is bias…
Isn't publishing this bad for Ukraine? idk maybe I'm just dumb but if Russia sees this maybe they would do something about it with the info or identities of these individuals that you are reporting on?
I’m Ukrainian Mexican and both my uncles were in the Ukrainian army and were drone operators. But both were killed last month with Russian kamakazi drones as their own comrades said you can’t hear kamakazi drones as they come down fast down. (RIP to both my uncles) also rip to the 3 Americans that’s were in his unit who were killed within a week
future war will be all drone
I wish they didn't have to ruin our hobby in order to use the fpv drones but they're fighting for their country. It just puts bad light on the hobby
This is free market capitalism - a perfect example of how this will organically lead to changes in the economy to address issues of the time. Get gov out of our businesses and we - the people- will innovate and thrive.
as a man with a military history know u have given so much info to the russians in this report ( names - locations - etc ) and im only half way through this .
The incogni link is not working mate
Ukraine is amazing. The US is intelligent for taking advantage of its MASSIVE capital of small businesses and individual minds to help brainstorm with this new technology. That’s how the US military manages to stay ahead and innovate, by utilizing individuals across the world. It’s a type of society that is extremely important for the future of humanity. If we hope to survive as a species and perhaps one day become a galactic civilization, we must find a way to propagate this type of cooperative/collaborative culture that the US has prioritized.
Could you imagine if humanity used all this ingenuity to good instead of war/civil war? Instead of letting those in power dividing us? Won't happen, but fun to think about. Humans are not capable.
It will be nice if drone can use free software without danger of cutting down DJIs by China
Aren't they DEI drones?
If this isn't being funded by the Ukraine government, it makes you wonder where all the money is going that we gave to them
Sponsored by Palantir
It's not the radio interference, it's a regular analog picture of a drone slightly moving off antenna's directions. It's like an old analog TV. Trees makes signal almost disrupt, depending on distance. Walls in a way might disrupt it even more. Joshua Bardwell had an interview with Ukrainian fpv droners, I think it's deleted now as Ukrainians named their drones as "Banderik" and Bandera is.. well Ukrainian national hero who fought on Hitler's side. He murdered a lot of Poles for Adolph. Anyways, Russia uses fpv drones to attack US and German tanks who's top is not armored that's why 1 kamikaze drone could destroy whole tank.  The DJI drones are traceable and usually artillery strikes a point where a person is launching DJI drone within 10 minutes.
Idk, is this suppose to be a good or bad information 😢
14:33 "The cat and mouse game here is kinda the Wild West for warfare..."   Don't you mean the Wild _East_ of warfare?  Do you get it? Hah...
You know what the problem is? The Russians hacked the American elections, the Ukrainians are building small lethal aeroplanes and helicopters which kill targetedly. In the end these are all weapons. Weapons like anything can be used for good and bad, the definitions are changing. The Ukrainians are using them against Russians right now so that is really "good", when other people start using them against America, its allies or NATO they will be "weapons of mass destruction". The narrative keeps on changing. What should be kept in mind is that they are weapons, we have a choice as humans which other animals do not have. We can put the weapons down and live a little harmoniously distributing all the excess we have. Or we can create more supposedly "fascinating" weapons, and die in the process. I know the answer to this already because as humans are stupid animals in the end, but I am trying to be hopeful!
Is this just giving information to russia?
Playing "Reapers" by Muse  (But the lyrics should be modified, 😅)
Awesome
thank you for informative video
I have been building exactly the same kind of FPV drones for years just for fun flying. Seeing them used like this is just scary.
Newsflash: NATO and their mercenaries have been defeated by Russia
6:05 Russia never had air superiority. If they have, war would be over long time ago. Sky is contested, no side has superiority.
Hi @JohnnyHarris we need to be very careful here. Ukraine's drones have been effective because Russia's combined arms offensive failed and they don't have air superiority. The nature of this conflict makes drones effective and that also goes for Yemen, Armenia-Azerbaijan and other places. We need to be very careful about forming future military doctrine that is heavily reliant on drone clusters and loitering munitions. It is the heavy weaponry and support from the West that allows Ukrainian drone makers to practice their craft.
Great video johnny! You killed it! Im up on all the Ukrainian war stuff(yes i know how bad that sounds). I think you hit all the points of topic i would!
Russia doesn't have air superiority
Nobody knows how nasty and horrifying war is until it comes to their homes and families
Whats the diffrence Between Ukraine and Palestine ???  Both r invaded by foreign country   What's the diffrence Between these 2 countries
Johnny:Spam is annoying Meanwhile: his comment section is filled with scammers
This is like some WW1 stuff with being on the verge of a change in how war is conducted with new technologies. Drones are our version of the tank or machine gun. Will we know how to combat these new technologies or will we be at some stalemate.
What worries me more than anything about this is that domestic terrorists in the US and other countries will catchi onto this. Next guy who wants to kill his teachers, co workers or some politicians they don't like, they'll just send a small FPV drone with a "payload". I've heard somewhere that some gun company is already working on a flying gun. I'm sure all the bad guys will register their drone and install an RID module, so nothing to worry about, right?
Just try to have a look on the terrmendous russian FPVs program which is outpassing Ukrainian one by far
Johnny definitely has the biggest monitor in the universe, confirmed
your link SPELLING is wrong.. leads to nowehre..
When the drone is hit by electronic jamming, is it possible to program it to automatically direct itself to the electronic jammer?
Would be nice if we just gave 935,592 rocket munitions  instead of 935,595  - and used the hundreds of millions from those 3 less to provide hundreds of thousands of drones.. I know the military industrial complex would hate that, though.  *Purposely exaggerated to make a point.
They're literally thinking of talking peace aith russia now lol Johnny is officially a cia bot
Please translate for Hindi Indian audience
Deadly as they are, i believe the Russian Lancet drone and its variants are much more lethal on the battlefield
Russians but those drones too now.
Sooooooo in other words, Government spends billions of dollars.... when it can be done at a very much lower price 👀🐸☕️
❤
I really wanted to understand orcs' minds. Are you saying those kids are making that to support a nazi government? Of course, logic doesn't make any sense to you
Russia 🇷🇺💪❤️
That drone with the 6 88 mm mortar tubes would definitely ruin someone’s day, that was freaking wicked looking.
Hey Johnny, it would be amazing if you make a video about why support for the far right  is on the rise in the western world. And how this would affect immigrants
Its one of those things I wish I was never right on, I told people so many times that drones would be the future of warefare over a decade ago and I was told I was stupid. And now sadly watching the Ukraine war unfold along with countless hours of footage I am sad to say I was right. Nothing more demoralizing and souless than dying to some £100 drone dropping 3 nades on you.
I just saw a documentary about this topic on TV :o
u do know that ukr is actually loosing?
I have Explained 2 Possibilities about Future of Israel-Hamas War in my lastest video!!
Obviously they are not doing this for free as we speak.
What aren't Palestinian drones changing warfare instead on the title? Arguably, it was actually Daesh who started this trend of weaponized consumer drones.
“How US Taxpayers are funding the war in Ukraine”. We can’t fund our own government but we can send money to Israel and Ukraine. It makes no sense.
That last quote is fucking brutal. Dude has a crystal clear clarity on what he needs to do.
When are you going to do a show about how you got started in the cia?
How glad I am that my country helps the Ukrainians, who are fighting so bravely and selflessly against a numerically superior and strong enemy, against the force of evil. It’s better to have such an ally than some Afghanistan where trillions of money were spent for unknown reasons. Eternal glory to all the fallen soldiers and guys who defended their country in every possible way. Long live free Ukraine. God bless America. NATO must be stronger than ever. 🇺🇲🤝🏼🇺🇦
FYI your Incongi link is not working but their web site is up
Background music is too loud during the intro
A FOV Drone chasing you with a gun attached to it sounds horrific.
Geez drone on about it why don't ya? I'm just kidding love you buddy, I'll see myself out
Who owns icogni?
You can tell how passionate is Johnny talking about something by the wobble of the desk and everything on it😂 Great video, I hope more people sees this to know what's actually going on in Ukraine right now 🇺🇦
16:58  забыл крикнуть "Хайль" 😢😢😢
Partnering with an organization that is pro-Ukraine. I wonder if this video will be pro-Ukraine…… who knows! 🤪
There is no difference between hamas And Ukrainian army. If  Ukrainian Resistance is considered Heroism  Y is Palestinian resistance considered Terrorism  750000 Palestinians ( who were expelled From Their land in 1948) can't return to their land   Gaza is under Blockade for 16 years   ( 2.3 million people live in Gaza)  If ukrainians have the right to defand themself  Y can't  these Arabs defand Their land and country
Major air forces are slowly going to take a backseat when you compare the cost effectiveness of a huge fleet of small drones launched on a target compared to the cost of aircraft carriers and jet fighters which put the pilots at risk, are massive losses if shot down and are much easier to detect. It won’t be long until we see a similar tactic used in the Palestine-Israel conflict if/when the ceasefire ends. Drone warfare is the new guerrilla war.
The incogni link is not working
This underground, grassroots warfare is like the Red Dawn film from the 80's. WOLVERINES!
Ruining my hobby thanks a lot 😢
Very good 🎉 you should do about Myanmar
Mormons please
Very interesting video, but very one sided, right now Russia also use drones. And they have much more variants other than helicopter types of them
15:34 - You must tear through mouses if that's how you click every time, Johnny.
call a resistance in Gaza "terrorist" and openly support invasion and Israel. and then tell us how Ukrainians are bravely defending their country, right to defend only resides with the West or it's allies?
It's sad to see a 20 years old guy building weapons to kill people. But I understand him. It's better to build weapons that being forced to go to the front lines to be killed.
The way you transition to an ad pisses me off just spit it out
Yo Johnny I want to use your beats on my YouTube channel  Please can I?
thank you for covering this mate.
isn't that what the palestinian resistance currently doing
There is a quality inn quantity. Yeah an expensive American suicide drone is likely better than a $300 diy drone. But for the price of one American drone you can get like 300 FPV drones... In the end the FPVs are a much better investment.
Dont you think Russian military will see this and use it
All thes could have been easily avoided, if Zelensky wasn't so keen bent on joining NATO, and serving western intrests at the cost of pissing off a Nuclear Neighbour.
thanks for such video <3 from UA
how'd I get here this early?   where am I?            who am I?
You're way too enthusiastic about the fact they are advancing a dangerous tech that will certainly be used to terrorize once this war is over.
Stand with Ukraine
Makes me think of Call of Duty. Lol
WHAT?
Hey Johnny, why aren't you releasing an epsiode one week earlier on Nebula anymore? It's the reason we all joined.
Johnny why would you not make a video about forced mobilization in ukraine, about how people flee the country and their rights are severely violated? Mm? Cia doesnt pay for that?
Thanks for doing this
Story of Hamas in Ukranian version.
Great video Johnny!!!
Is Incognito really giving you a service, a removal of your information from the list or are they collecting the information for themselves?. Incognito, sounds suspicious already.
intresting fact is that russians are far more superior in drones warfare, i think johhny havent seen the videos from russians side ..lol
Make a video about Armenia Azerbaijan Nagorno Karabakh conflict.
RSNPZD!
oh yeah :)
"Not by having bigger weapons, but by having smarter ones" - it reminds me of people who are arguing that Taiwan should persue asymmetrical capabilities _and not heavy weapons like tanks_: both are necessary.
I think Johnny underestimates industrial grade drones like bayraktar tb-2 in the beginning of the war. Without Turkish drones, war would over like in two weeks favor of russians.
Please make a video about Armenia Azerbaijan Nagorno Karabakh conflict.
Sorry, off-topic, but can someone comment on what wide monitor @JohnnyHarris is using in this clip at 0:50? Thank you!!
Sir, you are exposed because of your Isra*! hamaas video! You are a little better than your country USA but still bad for humanity 😅
Hard times breeds innovation
First!!!
Johnny Harris and Channel 5 reporting and video essays on these hard to stomach topics are going to change the face of journalism. Forever.
I hope you cover forced mobilisation and internally displaced, i find these two subjects the least covered.
Let's face it johnny 'Shaheed's need a video of their own too...
4:00 - Incogni ❤️
There not doing anything but infighting at this point … many rumours its very nearly game over for Zelensky and co. 👍
Russia wins drone war now
Youtube's CC "speaking foreign language" covers up the actual translation of the text in the video
Great topic, good coverage. But at the same time quite one sided, Russia is also making great steps in the diy drone space. Arguably they have already surpassed the Ukrainians since the start of the war.
What a joke to say Ukraines drones.
It makes me think about the 1920s when biplanes that could have been made in a rich guy's warehouse with canvas, wood and plumbing could be versatile and lethal enough to cripple some of the biggest capital ships of the era. (Yes this is a shoutout to the Swordfish.) It is *anything is possible* in both exciting and concerning ways.
Cant match russian production
“The only lives that truly matter are those who respect the lives of others“. - God said that, I’m only repeating it
this war has been so brutal ukrainians torturted , raped abducted as well as kidnapping of children into russia and the destruction and theft of ukrainian heritage sites and so much more just unbelievable
This is the war of NATO and the US against Russia. Ukraine is being used 😢.
Putin liked this video.
Does anyone else like the video before even watching because they know its going to rock?  I honestly would watch Johnny talk about... I dont know... even milkshakes... oh wait.  :)
Predator Missile Inbound!
In future gamers will be called veterans
Can't trust the Russians.
And my drone can’t even handle 5mph wind
But Ukrainian Nazis have lost it
Its amazing and scary what humanity manages to create in times of struggle and hope
Why is the audio so low? Can’t hear your voice at the beginning

Ukrainians resisting occupation is considered freedom fighters but P4l3st1n1an5 resisting occupation is t3rror1sm 😂, now that's what you call the hypocrisy of the western world ladies and gentlemen !!
It's shocking how much this war has changed war forever, and how much every major power has gotten it wrong. Specifically speaking of Americans, they lack a proper mobile short range anti-air defense platform like the Gepard, Tunguska, or Pantsir, which is critical for anti-drone warfare.  Likewise, the idea that a drone can be cheaper than a rifle in some cases just comes to show how insane and revolutionary this technology is.
Hahahahahaha, I was here before an ungodly amount of comments!
Drones are the whispers of technology echoing through the air, reminding us that the future is not a destination but a journey of endless discovery.
Not a war but a special military operation.
Ukraine resisting occupation is heroic because it serves your agenda but when Palestinians do it it is terrorism smh
NAFO OFAN!
We can buy a million drones in the price of one F22 raptor. Sometimes I really think every small nation should work on their drone technology.
Your videos are too good!
ive made these drones for 6 years :)
Russia will win. God willing.
War of robots
