Man I love R&B music and I can really say that this song is the soundtrack of my life I love it me and mine kept it 10 toes down with each other no outside influence came between us that's why we made it 💯
Sean's words are 100 percent true
If this was released in 2005 or 09 it would've been a huge hit.

Listening to this hi. Spitural
2025❤ I'm here!!!
Heard this song the other day on pandora.. hate to say that was my first time hearing it and it’s been on repeat since.  My wife has told me repeatedly to change the song, but I’m so obsessed with her vocals.
I just a few weeks ago realized that big Sean’s verse was about Jhené! Her brother passed away. She said in comfort Inn ending.
It's an unparalleled vibe transmitted here🔥
Love it❤️
🤍🤍🤍
I love this song
Me too
Me on repeat
🖤
🔥I would definitely hire you to Dj at an event 👍🏾
This song scored 100%.......Love in the house! #soulflames#loveforever.......Go Queen Naija
2025 listening
Here for it ❤❤❤
Doing a cover of this song 🤗🤗🤗🤗
This song will never get old!! ❤
She is so Red and Sexy and her voice is amazing 👏  2025 still better  than most songs out today. That Bobby Glenn song has been sampled  so many times but still  hits hard.
Its too bad i wasn't enough
Wish you the best, Queen Naija said some racist shit so idk about her, but y'know she got some decent music
Yep
A classic My song
