1:35 make sure you put the lift back down on the Ferrari when you sit still so it looks straight.  That aside, she need to have 10x more views.  She should be able to retire in 5 years with her skills.

Why is it that cardi has like 40+ million subscribers and M.A. only has 3+ million. I will never understand what happened to the game it ain't about wordplay or bars. The most basic bitches singing the same thing over and over get more views than her..

I get doing it on your own as an independent but pay the money for the features get a track with other well know artists and expand your audience. People sign record deals for exposure you don’t need to sign to a record label that’s gone steal everything from you just do features with other artists so you blow up
She is not underrated 😔. People don't care about good music 🎶
Yo young M. A AFTER SAYING DIPSET DIPSET SEVERAL TIMES NEXT LINE HAS TO BE Ouuu Ouuu... Check it out from 02:00
Feel like my father has a heartbroken. I feel it

Young MA really a goat
She’s been on fire this year. Everything I’ve heard has been quality.
She is colder than most ks
Hairs getting long MA. <3 slayed as usual
Dope! Sh*t rockin!
She been sick wit it and still is!! Bars!!!
He thinks he is a man so I’m torn on identity with her! Reminds me of 69
I have to say this is the first time im disappointed in her music for some reason she wasnt rhyming in the pocket kinda off beat and the bars were just ok but i have high expectations for anyone that slim shady says is dope so maybe its unfair but ive liked all the other songs and freestyle
💙
Who played that’s useless beat, pay attention to that beat 😁😁😁😁😁
finally dropped a music video, OUUUU!!!
I don’t see rappers, all I see are poets, all I see are role models. Like the lyrics “just drank half a bottle of Henny.” All while opening the door of a car, absolute perfection.
When I first heard this track I got me a DIPSET hat and made me a sandwich to celebrate 💯🏆
We ain't doin Chump change
She need to click up with Conway, Benny, and West Side

Went get a bag like a boss do.. next time if you want my heart it haffi cost you!!!!!
@ tyesha ward it said in the article that they use a skin lightening and bleaching lotion but that they deny it.The thing is they dont even look completely black anymore,they look like mixed race or something their skin is much lighter https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/1-best-seller-extra-strength-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml.I think they should be honest rather then want people to think  that they have naturally light skin,evidently this is the same lotion black celebrities in hollywood use to lighten their skin.
more fire from em ay, cant wait for the next album
“ GOT THE POWER LIKE I’M AUSTIN !!” 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽

Dunno what’s worse the shitty video or the shitty cheap music
I'm only here to warn with 💝🙏...( John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. ) We are living out Revelations in the Bible, please repent with your mouth to God and admit you are a sinner, Jesus died for us all and if we accept this gift he did we can be saved but we have to first repent and ask the Holy Spirit to come into Our lives and turn from sins. Believe Jesus died and rose again 3 days later so we can all be saved!! Pray often and seek a true relationship with God and get a Bible. Start reading your Bible, KJV is one type but this is an example where you can start. I know the Bible in Revelations talks about end times, we are living that out now. Please choose Jesus while he can still be found!  You Don't know when your last breath will be! 🙏💐😄
This is wack

This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has broken God’s moral law, the Ten Commandments. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken God’s name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers. James 2 : 10 also states that breaking even just one commandment makes us guilty of breaking them all.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because The Creator is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, EVERY sin will be brought to light, and punished. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved. Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a painful death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you sincerely do so, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. Also, he will grant you eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God has in store for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most Critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ is awaiting YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written  (Hebrews 9 : 27); ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i

M.A never misses! Your Red Flu Ep is a bop! We ready for that new album😈🩸🩸
Until people give their hearts and lives to JESUS CHRIST this world will always be a sinful and a heartless nation. The reason GOD is being patient with us is because GOD knows what hell looks like and feels like. Read in your HOLY BIBLE Leviticus chapter 19 verse 28 and Leviticus chapter 18verse 22 and Romans chapter 1verse 18-32 and Galatians chapter 5 verse 16-24 and 2 Timothy chapter 3. If we rejected GOD'S word we rejected GOD HIMSELF

( *Romans 2:4* ) "Don’t you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can’t you see that his *Kindness* is intended to turn you from your sin?"  ❎ It's *Not* the Wrath of God that leads you to repentance. ❎ It's *Not* the Judgement of God that leads you to repentance. ❎ It's *Not* Hell or pain or fire. ❎ It's *Not* the punishment. ❎ It's *Not* his anger.  *romans 2:4* ☑ "It's the *kindness/goodness* of God that leads you to repentance."  ☑ God *Is Not* waiting to judge you.  ☑ God *Is Not* waiting to condemn you. ☑ God *Is* waiting to *receive you* with mercy, with love, with open arms.  ☑ *Jesus took* the Hell, the Judgement, the Punishment, the Wrath, the Pain, the Sentence that we deserved. ☑ God *Is Not* mad or angry at you and *will never* be. ☑ God *doesn't* turn away when you mess up. ☑ God *Is Not* an angry God. ☑ God *won't hate* you because you made a *mistake* one too many times. That's *Not* how he works. ☑ You are *Loved* by an incredibly *Merciful, Gracious, and Forgiving* Father. ☑ The *Bible* is about *You* and *GOD* ☑ God speaks to *you* through the *Bible* and the Bible is about you. It's all about *God's love* for you, *God's promises* for you, and *God's unending willingness* to forgive the mistakes you make. ☑ The *Bible* is also about God. The God who created *the world and everyone* in it. The God who saw what *he made* and it was good. The God who saw *Adam and Eve* fall into sin, and the God who sees everything you *do, think, and say* every moment of every day. ☑ God Endures. God *will never* leave you, God *will never* stop loving you, God *will be* your rock, God *will always* do what is best for you, God *will always* be by your side, every single moment of every single day. ☑ When God created you, *he made you* in his image. ☑ *Turn from* Sin, turn to God, find Life. ☑ *FEAR GOD* Jesus says you really *shouldn’t be afraid* of anything. Instead, *you should* fear God. WHY? Because God holds your *entire story* in his hands. And not just your story here on earth. God is the one who ultimately decides *where* you will spend eternity. But while you fear God, you can also *trust in his Son, Jesus Christ, who died* to forgive you of all the mistakes you make here on earth. On that day when you face God, Jesus *intercedes on your behalf* and reminds *your heavenly Father* that those sins were *wiped away with his sacrifice* on the cross. ☑ God *IS* Love. ☑ Before the *Foundation/Creation* of the World, *God knew you, God loved you, God chose you* ☑ God has the hairs of your head *numbered* Every moment of your life is *watched by God* ☑ It doesn't make any difference *how far* you try to run from God. He *Loves* you. His eye is *on you* and he *sees you* ☑ God *Loves You* with an *Everlasting Love* forever and ever. ☑ When God looks at you, he sees the *Righteousness* of Jesus. ☑ In God's eyes you are *Loved, Chosen, Holy, and Without Fault* ☑ You are *Perfect* in the Father's sight. ☑ See yourself the way *God sees* You. ☑ God holds *nothing* against you. ☑ Love keeps *no record* of wrongs. ☑ God *so loved* the world that *he gave* his one and only Son. ☑ God *loves* you as much as he *loves* Jesus. ☑ God is *for you, Not against you* ☑ Jesus came from *Heaven to this Earth* for You. ☑ God *wants You* in Heaven.

That's the *GOAL*  ☑ Our home is *not here but in Heaven* ☑ Jesus *died for you* on the cross. He took *your place and took your sins* there. Look to Jesus.  ☑ Sin cannot exist in God's presence, so Jesus was *banished* from the presence of God at the cross.  *Despite your mistakes, failures, flaws, sins, words, thoughts, actions, Anything that you've done, God, your Heavenly Father, STILL loves you unconditionally*  *REVELATION = JESUS WINS* 👑 👼 👼 👼 👼 👼 👼 👼🎺  †=💙💙💙💙💙🌎 👼JESUS Loves You👼 👼GOD Loves You👼 GOD💪     JESUS 👑 ✨📖✨ You Will Always Be Loved By GOD.

REPENT turn to Christ now before it’s to late. “For this is how God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world through him. There is no judgment against anyone who believes in him. But anyone who does not believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God’s one and only Son. And the judgment is based on this fact: God’s light came into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light, for their actions were evil.” John 3:16-19 Jesus is the only way to heaven nothing else is going to save you.  "I am the way, the truth, and the life!" Jesus answered. "Without me, no one can go to the Father.  John 14:6  if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.” Romans 10:9  “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” Romans 10:13  Jesus saves! ✝️ If your hurt, insecure, tired, don’t feel loved, don’t feel satisfied. Go to Jesus he’s the only one who will satisfy, give you rest, and loves you no matter what.  All you gotta do is repent and believe, the bible says we are all born in sin shaped with iniquity. The only way we can take off that weight of sin is to turn to Jesus, he’s the only one that’s gonna satisfy and the one that’s going to show you real love.   “If you are tired from carrying heavy burdens, come to me and I will give you rest.” Matthew 11:28  Jesus paid the price on The cross, so that me and you don’t go to hell and spend eternity with him. Isn’t that AMAZING!  He loves you with everything he is. He gave his Life for YOU🙂. Now why not wanna live for him. Come to him as you are you don’t need to be perfect to come to him.  “With God anything is possible.” Matthew 19:26  Being “good” does not make us right in God’s eyes.  “No one is good but God alone.” Mark 10:18 Therefore doing good deeds does not make us right with God.  “But you cannot make God accept you because of something you do. God accepts sinners only because they have faith in him.” Romans 4:5  “All of us have sinned and fallen short of God's glory.” Romans 3:23  “For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.” Romans 6:23  I’m not saying you to Get religious I’m saying have a genuine relationship with The Lord Jesus Christ:)💙

Every month yung M.A drop a banger then leave us again ..😅😬😪 #Redlife
I have sinned against God so many times and I thought that I was unforgivable. But there is a God greater than this universe that loves me and has a bigger and better plan for me. Repent and accept Jesus before it is too late.  Prayer: Lord Jesus, I am ready to be accepted into the kingdom of Heaven. I believe that you died on the cross to save me. Jesus, forgive me of my sins and wash away my old life. Let me start a new life with you in Jesus Name. Amen

For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:” ‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭15:1-4‬ ‭KJV‬‬  The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 | KJV  REPENT: feel or express sincere regret or remorse about one's sin   THIS WORLD IS FULL OF SIN JESUS IS THE ONLY WAY !!! JESUS is COMING BELIEVE AND AND ACCEPT HIM AS YOUR LORD AND SAVIOR TRUST IN HIM TODAY GOD LOVES YOU SO MUCH JUST COME BACK HOME AND LOVE HIM BACK  DENY YOURSELF DAILY AND TURN FROM SIN DAILY         #christian #jesus #faith #love #god #bible  #christ #church #christianity #fairtrade #gospel #hope #blessed #jesuschrist #truth #handmade #prayer #pray #scripture #life #holyspirit #worship #peace #godisgood #inspiration #religion #bibleverse #encouragement #motivation #goodnews

She doesn't sound like a woman.  She doesn't look like a woman.  She doesn't rap like a woman. With that said.. quit comparing Young MA to other women rappers.  Why can't you consider her  one of the best rappers in general?  Why does the fact she has a vagina have to do with anything? Rappers are rappers.  I don't care if you're white black hispanic asian gay straight or in a wheelchair.
braba
Cannot put out a shit song
This chick is off the chain I wanna be like her when I grow up

my fav part of the song is                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      But fuck love, love is just a bitch that never paid me Then what'd you do? (What you think?) Went and got a bag like a boss do So next time you wanna have my heart, it's gon' cost you (Uh) It's RedLyfe, baby, but my heart blue (My heart blue) My money number one, so listen, ho, you just a part two (Ooh) So play your part, I ain't got no time for your feelings now
