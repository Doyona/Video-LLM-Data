Anyone here *AFTER* the wedding??
god watching these videos makes me feel bad for my parents having to go thru this process too
i know this video is almost two years old but i'm still curious: how does it work for twitch streamers when you're adjusting status? did he just not stream during that time?
not me nodding my head along to everything. this process sucks so hard but it's soooo worth it. I know it's been like a year but congrats, Kayla and Dan, on closing the distance <3
🤧🥺😊
You posted this video on my birthday lol-
anyone noticing she looks like her boyfriend like if i didnt  know better i would bc like sweet home albama
Yesss!!! Simsie!!!!!!
I will steal you from him one day.
Congratulations! This is like in The Sims series when you and your fiancé got approved. Then lifetime points got increased. I could imagine when the couple were in The Sims game series.
Y’all been together for only like a year….
Congrats!!!!
Omg congratulations!!
Turkey is in Europe
LILSIMSIE Can you help me meet my Australian boyfriend of 3 years? We want to get married :( We even contacted an immigration lawyer and even he couldn't think of anything :(
So is he going to have to go to Mexico now? Been excited for this for a long time for you! I love love!  My high school sweetheart and I were in a long distance relationship for 3 years while he was in Germany in the army and it was so difficult. But of course he came home and we had the happiest life and marriage until he passed at 38 from a seizure  unexpectedly. Seize the day and love with all your heart!!!
Good luck for tomorrow x
It’s so weird how similar our situations are! I was planning on moving to England with my fiancé until the pandemic and now over a year later I finally have my visa!!! It was such a hassle
I looked at the thumbnail and thought, “welp, 15 year olds are getting married earlier than me” AND THEN I REALIZED IT WAS YOU. 😂 Congrats!!!!
get a baby😂😂😂😂 lmao jk
get a baby😂😂😂😂 lmao jk
I'm excited for you! I can't imagine having to go through that whole process. It's probably similar to adopting a kid, I bet. Just the waiting and money out of pocket. Basically, having to prove yourself to the government isn't fun. I know someone who's been waiting 3 years to get their visa. So, I'm glad yours didn't take nearly as long. $2000 well spent. And yes, you may feel like you were scammed, which I get. But we also don't know all the stuff they have to do on the other end. Hopefully, this was more of a "we want people to be together, so let's get the visa ball rolling" instead of "here's a way we can make loads of money". Anyway, happy for you and Dan. <3
So Happy for you!!!! My favorite simmer ;) Congrats and Best wishes!
Congratulations...
JUNE 29th IS SO CLOSEEEE EEEEE
Yes it’s a process I’m deciding if I want to do it as well so I can move back to US w/ my SO or just not 😂
Congratulations!!
Yeah... US is so complicated... My experience has been hell too.
I know I’m late but… Congratulations !!!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Omg the work quarantine is absolutely ridiculous. They're _trying_ to make it insanely difficult.
You make a cute couple. And congratulations.
This isn’t a hate comment, I’m gay myself. I totally thought lilsimsie was a closted lesbian. I’m really sorry and I regret my actions. Around when the disney princess legacy was a thing, I totally was convinced you were a lesbian due to a response from a donation on twitch. One of your heirs was a lesbian and you cheated a gay pregnancy. A donation said something like “Don’t blame them, girls are hot and I hate all men” and you said something like “I don’t blame you”. And I definitely didn’t buy your “visiting friends” in London thing. I was convinced you had a secret gf in London, or something. You technically could be queer but you flat out called yourself out for lying in the “visiting friends in London thing”. Not sure how to end this, sorry for it being so long
Congratulations kiddo, so happy for the both of you.
Congratulations! I can't believe you're engaged you look like 14 😭😭
I AM SO EXCITED FOR YOU! CONGRATS!!!!!
How did I miss this video for TWO MONTHS?!?! Congrats, Kayla :D I feel like a sims idea would be to orchestrate different sims' weddings - maybe also a SimSelf dream one and SimSelf realistic one to share the things you like, then compare it to the real one, when you fancy sharing however much of that you are happy to? :)
Kayla: "Marry for visa 👍" Some people: ??? Me: They're close to fiance readiness, it's just more to be able to live together. The symbolism of marriage they aren't exactly getting married for, but they love each other and that's enough for them. Some people: ??? Me: I give up Kayla: I WANT ENGAGEMENT PHOTOS All her subscribers: AaAAaaAaaaAaaaAhHHhhH 😆 Me: That works
Next time you're gonna get affianced, get him some kinda work visa and then have a whirlwind romance that ends with a wedding while he's here. Makes the process much shorter if you present yourselves as a done deal, in country, rather than a potential pair divided by the ocean.
Congratulations!!!! OMGG
So happy for you!!!! It’s such a great feeling finally getting to live with your other half!
Ugh this takes me back to my time applying for the J1 and the green card, gosh such a pain in the butt
youre getting MARRIED OMG
AYO Poggers⁉️⁉️ Ik it’s old but still Poggers
CONGRATS LILSIMSIE
HOW DO I WATCH U EVERYTIME- AND NOT KNOW THAT U ARE ENGAGED
Oh my God, I'm so happy for you! This is so crazy, I've been watching your videos for years now, I get that feeling like I really know you in real life <3 Anyway, I wish you both all the best in this life! Marriage is the most insane, delicious adventure! Have FUNNNN you guysss :D
Ahhhhhhh, wow! Good luck with all visa stuff and wishing the two of u a lovely future :) my bf and I are only just starting our process for me moving to him in the UK x
Congrats 💘💖❤️♥️
So if he can't apply for jobs in the US for 6-9 months, then does that mean he has to stop doing twitch, or since it's self employment, he should be fine?
Ahhh I’m so happy for u! It’s June now I can’t wait for the update from the interview
Amazing story, was a good video for me to watch aswell. I'm currently at the VERY START of all this, we havent even met yet! we met through Twitch, she's from the UK and I'm a dutchy myself, I don't know how hard or maybe easier it will be , considering the UK has left the EU. the most important that I personally have in this state is that we have a rock-solid plan, how do we see eachother in X amount of years, when do we meet ? how do we meet during all this ? obviously pandamic, I was supposed to meet her soon but thats not going to happen.  its a funny story, I accidently clicked on her stream about 4 months ago, just to recruit her for a discord to reach affiliate, played a few games along on her stream and that was it. she joined but I didnt think she would stay around, untill she messaged me, ''I'd like to know you better'' just as friends you know, we started asking questions and had our first video call, it was a bit akward at first we were both smiling and giggling didnt quite know how to react.  at some point we exchanged snapchat names and started showing daily things during the day, saying goodmorning and goodnight aswell. untill at some point we got VERY honest. I dont remember who made the first step into that but it comes to the point: we had a crush on eachother, yeah we been talking EVERY day since Februari and we felt a big connection. calling everyday just asking how eachothers day was and discussing what could be. we grew REALLY close and have big plans upcoming, because we havent met yet! I'm taking her see the Tulipfields over here, giving the taste of a fresh ''stroopwaffel'' and take her out picknicking in the dunes next to the beach while she gets to show me typical english things oh... and that accent... ;)  this is my/our story so far, if its meant to be it will finds its way
$2000? Me and my partner had to pay $10,000 in Australian for our version of “K1” and we haven’t heard anything from immigration for 2years although our situation is different cause he is already here not in a different country! Anyway I hope it works out for you, definitely a stressful process!!!!!
Congratulations 🎊 I remember watching your videos since you were teeny weeny, still in school, I was listening to your Susan stories hahha. Now you are getting married omg
90 day fiancé is one of my favorite shows ever. I couldn’t even imagine the visa process during the pandemic
So basically he's from Edinburgh and wasn't able to access "manage worlds" and change neighborhoods because of an event. Got it.
My husband moved from the US to Canada in 2019 (thank GOD we did it before Covid....). We actually got married before we applied which meant it didn't matter how much money I made and tbh it sounds like it was *so* much easier for him to move here than it would have been if I'd moved to the US. Though it did cost us 7k CAD because our lawyer was quite expensive, but it was also very inclusive - we really only had to send her our proof that we actually were in a relationship and she took care of everything else. Anyway, congrats Kayla!! I'm really excited for you - I know how happy it is knowing you've got your interview date and that it's almost (mostly) done.
I'm so Happy for you🌺💜👰✨
Yayayyayayayayyyayayayayyaayyaya
congrats! Good luck! ♡
Yay
Congrats
Why do you and Dan look like siblings?
After you said 40 mins at the end I literally had to go back and look at the time! 😆 Girl you got me there! Big congratulations!
This is very informative for people who don't know. I already knew a lot of it already. My father worked in USINS. Applying for visas from state department, filing paperwork, getting green cards, etc are all a major pain and are quite expensive. It's gotten even worse over the years. Used to be faster but they have the system all screwed up now. You have to stay on top of them. In the new system if you don't keep checking up every couple months they will claim you lost interest and throw the paperwork out & you have to start all over. As an aside, my best friend bought a car from the angry wife of a guy who got deported back to Honduras because he didn't keep up on his green card paperwork. You'd be surprised at how many guys overseas will file for fiance visas while actually married to someone in their home country. They use US citizens to get green cards, wait until they are fully established as citizens or permanent residents, divorce their US wives, and then bring their foreign wives over. It's part of the reason why the system is such a PITA. If your fiance has been vaccinated for Covid he probably has a better chance of getting over. Fun fact: The largest portion of illegal immigrants in the US are people who entered legally but overstayed their visas. I'm excited for you and hope everything goes smoothly.
I though u were a teenager 😭
Do NOT take that C19 Vaccine! Neither of you.
Yeah, I moved to the US 5 years ago, and still in process of getting green card, it is so frustrating
sorry, but europe isn't a country hahaha
Congratulations
Whenever i saw this i was like *HOLYYY*   (also congrats)
Congrats ...you will  need paperwork ,  paperwork paperwork ...  it’s all about paperwork and good moral character .
Congratulations!!!
Comgats
CONGRATS!!!
Simsie: he came over for 3 months  Also her: he was over here for 2 months  Me: uhh so anyway math has left my head as well...  Anyway congratulations on the engagement 👏 👏👏👏🤗
I moved from the UK to Florida last year to be with my partner and I didn’t really realize how lucky I was until now. Thankfully I was already a citizen so I didn’t have to go through any of this! I also moved RIGHT before the pandemic started, so while I haven’t seen my parents in over a year now (and likely won’t be seeing them until Christmas at the earliest), I at least got to spend the last year or so living with my best friend and not worrying about when I’ll be able to see him again. I’m glad everything’s finally moving forward for you!
I know all about the visa process because of my stepmum. My dad and her are now married and she lives here but the whole process is still going on. It's ridiculous and expensive
why am I JUST NOW SEEING THIS
Ah yes, the great country that is Europe
I've been trying to move to Austria from the US to be with my partner, and I have to go for six months, with three months inbetween the next time I go when I'm twenty one, so don't mind me just sobbing over this good news for you
Congratulations 😄
Saved this just in case :D
YES
"not all countries are banned from travel to the US. Just some, like Europe" oh no "so if he goes somewhere else like, Turkey" oh she didnt just
Just found your account also congratulations
Wow congratulations for your engagement 💗💗💗 by the way, i was surprised (in a good way) thay you are already getting married 😍 you look so youngggg. How young are you??? (Curious me***) hehehe
OMG CONGRATS!!!
my aunt applied for a US visa for my mom long ago and they've literarily been waiting for the answer for 8 years now))) so I guess you're still lucky)) btw, congratulations, wishing you lots of love <3 and happiness!!!
omg i thought all these years she was a teenager.... wtf
you're so pretty..
"Why am I not moving to the UK?" Because the UK is garbage. It's okay, you can say it.
please dont change your last name though
I hope that you can soon “woohoo” with him lol
How old is she ?._.
What happens once the fiance visa runs out ?  What's the next step looking like ?? Congrats ❤️❤️
and i thought people that had long distance from like states we're rough-
I'm pretty new to the channel, so I haven't seen any of your non sims related content yet, but I'm actually shocked at how invested I got in this video ASJDJRJF- like.. I'm not even in a relationship and I'm sitting here like fully attentive, about to take notes on how to get a k1 visa
Congrats!
No offense, but you 2 look like siblings. The pale skin and red hair. 😆🤭😔
lol all this serious goverment talk and the just kayla: *imatates her hands talking* meh meh meh
I admire your patience for the one you love! Congratulations! 🥲💓
“Just some countries are banned like China, Brazil and Europe” ahh yes my favourite country is deffo Europe 😂
Can’t wait until he can move here so you guys can be together in person 😍🥰💕
Congrats! I love watching y'all interact, very happy for y'all :)
ok congrats but why did she call "europe" a country 10:42
I am so very happy for you both, when I have seen you together (on YouTube) you are so cute.  Will be watching for more of your story.
CONGRATS!!!
Congratulations!!!!
As an American who moved to London and went through the process flipped - it is NO easier getting to the UK from here. Stressful, expensive, and irritating - finally worked out. So happy for you!
I personally LOVE 90 day fiancé.. but we all know reality... I loved hearing about your real life k1 experience even more!  Keep us updated. Dag dag!
He's a lucky guy! 💕💓
At first I thought "Siblings or Dating" made a youtube channel
Amazing news that the case is finally making a shift. Lockdown is finally easing over here in the UK so that timing of the third legal case was very lucky. Congratulations on your official engagement. And just as a little bit of peace of mind, all of our travel bans are to be lifted by the end of June with our Prime Minister's current plan. Good luck with getting your fiancé there. I really hope it all works out successfully.
seems like we have waited so long for the interview .. currently still waiting for that as well. my husband will do his interview in Mexico. the waiting game is so stressful ..... xxx from NC
Congratulations! I know what the process is like. I am Canadian and I moved to Australia to marry my husband. I initially went on a visitor's visa which was extended then we married pretty quickly before that expired and then I was on a spousal visa until I finally got temporary residency which became permanent residency then I became a citizen. The whole process, from arriving in Australia to becoming a citizen, took over 5 years. Good luck!
Yay i see your excitement! Hope everything turns out the way ypu guys wish for😊❤️
I thought you were still 17 lmao congrats
Congrats!!!!
wait i though your like 18 or 19
13:28 this
I know americans don't want to face this fact, but europe is not a country
Congrats!

Congratulations
Congrats🥳🥳🥳
Congratulations 💕
Oh my gosh this is so much work 😱
Congats!!!
It's been awhile since I've watched a lilsimsie video, and now she's getting MARRIED!?😱 What did i miss!!! But CONGRATULATIONS!!!!❤
You didn't actually say when you got engaged
Congratulations Kayla and Dan!! 💜
Ah yes the country of europe ❤
so happy for you xx
Congratulations to you both 🌸🥳🥰🌸
Many Americans don’t realize how many years it takes to get through this citizenship process. A friend is five years into the process and everything stalled because of COVID.
Boring
Congrats!!!!
i have a really nice challenge for you: its the travel challenge and the point is to travel with your sim in every world on every lot, but you can stay just a week in a world      tips for more fun gameplay:1take another sim with you 2fill Newcrest with gallery lots 3visit the secret lots to(that will be hard)
Congrats! I know that I hate living in different houses from my partner. I can't imagine being an ocean away. Love this for you.
As a Brit moved to the US (as a fiancee) it took me 10 years and a lot of money to get my green card. Congrats and best of luck. It's arduous and difficult, but so worth it!
I came here on a K1 visa. It took us 1 year from application to getting the visa. I came here for 3 months with a vacation visa before we got married too so we could find an apartment etc together and some wedding planning.  I'm so sorry that you had to wait so long. When i had my interview they took my passport to put the visa in and they sent it back to me within a couple of weeks. Bring some pictures to the interview. It's a pretty ridiculous process to be honest...
YAYYYYYYYYY
Congratulations sweetheart, sending all my love from 🇬🇧
Congratulations ⭐
I do understand this she is not the only one many people have this problem. It's sad and it's hard to not be with the one you love because of the covid-19 and no flying
OMG congrats
Congratulations!!
Congrats
congrats!!
happy for you simsie :)
So happy for you!
wow, can't believe she's getting married at age 12
Congratulations ❤️😍
So happy for u!! 😍
Could he go to Canada?
Omg congrats !!!
Congratulations! I hope the ban is lifted so he can come straight here. I met my husband online. We have been married 11 years now. Good luck to you both!!
To your brother?
This is a crazy amount of useful information for me. I've been doing some research on US immigration too for someone and there's SO much out there that it's overwhelming.
Congratulations! Excited for you both!
I completely understand. Haven't seen my honey in 1 year and 4 months... and counting... sigh. I am doing the opposite and moving to his country.
Im so happy for you!! I hope it all goes smoothly! ❤
The government is wayyyybtoo big.
Heyyyyyy I didn't know we had something in common too. I also didn't know u had a long distance relationship. I've been in one for 9 years we got married 3 years ago. We are also waiting for our immigrations since the middle of 2020. It sucks, hang in there!
in the desc it says ts4 is 13 or up n stuff still lol
Omg this is so cute! Congrats!! ❤️ I love your channel 🥰
y'all look so similiar to each other. thought it was your brother in the thumbnail at first lmao. congrats.
As soon as Dan gets here, we want Jenna Marbles (god rest her channel) style content.
I'm in a very similar position right now. I'm from Canada and my boyfriend is in the UK. He moved back in march 2020 2 months after we met. He's been approved to enter the country. We were waiting for the travel ban to be lifted but now also until he gets his vaccine.
So exciting! My husband and I did the CR1 Visa for me to move to the US and I get the exhaustion 😅 You guys got this! ❤️
IAU*YHFKJLPOW OH MY GSOSPAD CONGRATSSSSSSSS! <3333
Congrats! Has anyone ever said that you guys look like siblings 😂?
Yaaay! Congratulations 💕
Congrats !!!!!
This is super cute ♥️ the whole process is crazy and well done to you both for getting through it with COVID too ♥️ congratulations
I love this for u Kayla. I’m so happy ur happy❤️
OMG congratulations!! 🥳🥳🥳🥳
Congrats! Wish you & fiance all the best. Love & prosperity
CONGRATS KAYAK! YOU DESERVE EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD!
congrats!
Wow, i listened to Kayla till the end, without pause 😂. CONGRATULATIONS, all the best ❤️❤️❤️.
CONGRATS!! ❤❤
Yaaaaaaaayyyy duck dan simsieee
this is crazy bc i’ve watched kayla since she was 16-17 and it’s so cool seeing her grow into an adult ❤️❤️ congrats ily
Mazel tov!!!
Oh man, you're missing out on that NHS by having jim move here tho
This video is such a mood, cause I'm in the US and my girlfriend lives in Jamaica(But she does have a British citizenship)
I was gonna say I believe under this new administration he could just cross the Mexican border. But I applaud the strength you two had to go through due process and during a pandemic! Congrats.
Oh my goodness! Congratulations! 🥳💍
Congrats!!! ❤️   Who in his right mind... Would immigrate to the US voluntarily when you're basically from europe omg 🤣  Good luck with everything!
YES!!! CONGRATS!!
So happy for you guys! ❤️
AHHH CONGRATS
omg the mashup I never realised I wanted. 90 day fiance meets Sims 🤷🏻‍♀️
I literally hate all the government related paperwork. My boyfriend and I are moving to Canada from Europe in May and I’m honestly lost when it comes to this stuff.
This is very eye-opening and educational and congratulations
I am studying international law in the Netherlands, and i took immigration law my American teacher told me about the unwritten 3 suit rule. Basicly immigration officers want to see 3 different suits for them to see you have enough money. The three different suits as in on your photos, your interview and the second interview of when you actually go to the US. Also i am writing my thesis on the American Immigration System and it just blows my mind how difficult and how much exclusion it is based on. I hope your fiance can get through everything easily and you guys can be together!
My husband and I applied for his visa back in August of 2020, and are watching our status hoping for an interview soon. It truly is a long process! Glad to hear they scheduled an interview and you have something to look forward too!
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU AND DAN!!! :D xx
Yayyy! So happy for you two!! Now you can build your future “sim” house together in real life :)
CONGRATULATIONS SO HAPPY FOR YOU
I wonder if theyll actually take his biometrics; I became a citizen during covid and they didnt have us do it (basically they had interviews with ipads and swearing in in the same day) but they didnt refund us of course... and congratulations!! i understand how nerve wracking it is to keep checking the status and having no answer. I applied for my citizenship while the office was closed and that was frustratingly slow enough i cant imagine having to deal with two countries' different covid policies. I hope the interview goes well! If they do the ipad thing honestly i found it a lot easier than the in person interview for my greencard back in the day. Best of luck to you both <3
I love you simsie I'm so excited for you<3 I've watched you for so long and I love you so much congrats♥️♥️♥️
I am very excited
I'm tripping she's only like a year older than me and she's engaged eye-
congrats but- the 90 day fiance flashbacks of watching that with my family when i was like 10 LMFAOOO
I'm so happy for you!  And I'm so happy to have this whole process explained to me.  I met my boyfriend online too and we have been trying to learn about the process to have him come here from another country as well.  It seems so discouraging when you look at the big picture, but worthwhile in the end of course.  Question though:  I know you paid that attorney for the lawsuit, but did you guys do this all on your own or did you hire an immigration attorney?
I HAD NO IDEA SHE WAS ENGAGED!!!!
My fiance and I are in nearly the exact same position as you, timeline and countries and all, I just wish we had known about that lawsuit and everything. Very happy for you! We know first hand how this process feels.
you and your fiancé should be on the siblingsordating instagram
I like that as of this comment 211 people saw this and were like UGH I DISLIKE THIS
Congrats I'm so excited for you ❤❤❤
Congrats!🤍
Congratulations! 🥰❤️
Yayyytt
I FEEL YOU!!! I married my american husband and went through the whole government process. it was crazy expensive and took ages, and we got through way faster than usual! I also visited him for 3 months at a time and at one point it was 6 months I couldn't visit and it was hell! I feel so bad for all the long distance couples who have been away from each other during covid :(
CONGRATS !!!
Kayla - dates boyfriend for 3 years, sees him a handful of times in person. Gets engaged and gets boyfriend to move countries.   Me: dates my partner for 4 years, has 2 kids to him. Lives together for 3 years.  Still no engagement. 🤦‍♀️
😮.......😃👏 Oh, my, gawd! Congrats, Kayla!!
The original seasons of 90 Day Fiance did a much better job portraying what the K-1 visa is about. Now it's just another dramatic reality show 😩. Thank you for telling us how it really is and best of luck to you and Dan!
So happy for you!!!! Having a person makes such a difference with Covid. I am excited he is coming soon and the end is in sight for you! :) Love is beautiful ❤️
Omg eventually move to the uk. It’s great! ❤️ this last two weeks we have had a heat wave. Then snow 😂❤️ it was wild
turkey is europe though :) but im so happy for you guys
When did you meet the last time? ❤️💕
If anybody is aware of a way to smuggle me from Europe to the US please please let me know. I see some people in the comment saying they work at visa acceptation and stuff... you know... help a girl out...
I'm so glad your case is finally being handled!! Congratulations, I hope all goes well!
*love* the thumbnail
Congrats! My husband is an immigrant too. We met while he was on a student visa though so our process was a bit different. Thank you for sharing your story! Not many people realize how expensive and complicated it can be. Best wishes!💜
also havent been able to visit my boyfriend during the pandemic and hoping that in june i can stay for a while and that will help for when I apply for our visa, I know its going to be A LOT of WORK and MONEY but the thought of moving to the states and being able to marry him makes it all feel worth it 10x over. Thank you so much for making this video it helped me so much as someone who is about to embark on this journey you have been on
I don’t know why I thought you were Canadian this whole time
BABE your eyebrows need some help! more feathering less outlining
Ahh Congrats! If the travel ban is still around go on a 2 week (14 day) honeymoon (;
Sometimes I forget that you're not 16 anymore 😂😂
Congratulations!!!
Congratulations
Wouldn't it have been ironic if someone gave Dan a raise so he could afford to sponsor her to go to the UK?
Congrats to you both! I hope Dan likes the US when he moves here, and I wish you both a lifetime of happiness. ❤️❤️
omg so exciting
No way Kayla your engaged OMG congratulations
WOW! First, my wife and I love watching you! Just WOW!! I lived in Scotland for 3 months! Tried to get the Visa to move there but, yeah! It is crazy! Watching you explain all this? There really needs to be a Cross eyed emoji !! lol.. Congrats! I hope you get this sorted :)
wow wow wow congrats!!! ❤️
Congratulations. "It should have been me!" lol.
It must have been such a stressful year for the both of you!! Huge congrats for getting past all this, and I hope everything goes smoothly <3
Honestly, you're just so lovely, my dude.
I wonder what quarantining in another country entail? Like would he have to stay at a specific center/location alone in an allowed country? Or would they theoretically be able to turn it into a little baecation where they meet up in an allowed country and spend the time together and then return to the US together?
OMGGG your interview is on my birthday !!
Congrats!
congrats!!!
My boyfriend and I aren't doing the visa process (thankfully we are both Canadian), but we will be long-distance for 8-12 months coming up pretty soon and it's nerve-wracking!
I applied for US citizenship at the beginning of 2020 and literally just finished the whole process, i totally understand how you feel!!! Good luck to you and dan ❤️
an old roommate of mine processes those visas, it sounded like such a headache. But she was able to escalate some sketchy situations to the proper authorities which is a helpful thing with the beauracracy
Is he not gonna be able to stream when he's here or does the work visa only include "real" jobs?
congrats girl im right there with you i know all to well how it feels to have the government controlling everything. funny thing is people used to tell me with international relationship that you should get used to immigration being part of your relationship until the other person becomes a citizen and that is so true. i just got married actually to my fiance but he has been here in the usa also from england since 2019. he came here to visit and one thing let to another and he stayed. he got his work permit which let him work in our country and now we are legally married so tryin to get the stuff together to now file a green card soon. honestly the prices are ridiculous its about 2k for a green card as well. we had to wait so long cause our issue is i dont make the most money in our household he does and we were told we had to make at least 21,500 to apply and we just are making 2400 atm but thats due to covid and unemployment so now its waiting to get answers on if they will accept that so we can start that process as well. it is a long drawn out thing but if you even want to chat with someone message me its nice when you run across people who been there too.
Congrats ❤️
GOOD JOB!!!!!💓💓💕❤ I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!
"...trying to move my cat"
june 29th is my birthday! i’m so excited for you 2 months and 21 days to go!!!! whoot whoot!!
as a 90 days fiance viewer, be careful with the loopholes when it comes to the travel ban - one of the women in 90 days, were in the same situation like you guys, she travelled to mexico with the intention of quarantining and then entering the us, she got detained and sent back to france (I'm sure you guys have things under control, but just be extra aware of the loopholes) congrats btw!!!!!
i've never left a youtube comment in my life but i just gotta know, HOW did he propose????? i'm so desperate to hear that part of the love story i've been scrolling through comments and coming up empty
NO WAY OMG CONGRATULATIONS
congrats. when i did my interview they ask a lot of questions but they are all easy and some are just yes and no
HELLLLLLL YEA!!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!
Congratulations
My boyfriend lives in Florida and I live in Scotland. This puts the fear of god into me. O_O
me (German) and my boyfriend (Swiss) have been separated for almost 2 months in April 2020 due to European border closures and that was the worst time in my life. ever since then we've been fighting and worrying so much about quarantine laws etc etc and my question is: HOW the HELL do you cope with not seeing your fiancé this LONG. y'all are superheroes. international and bi-national couples really have the hardest time during this fcking pandemic.
So happy for you that you finally have progress! The whole process sounds very draining. Have you seen 'Like Crazy'? It's a love story between a US guy and a UK girl and talks about their relationship and the problems they have with immigration. It stars Felicity Jones (amazing actress) and Anton Yelchin (sadly now deceased) and Jennifer Lawrence even has a minor role. Anyway, I love, love, love that movie. Recommended, but perhaps only once you have your fiancé with you at last. :D
This is really illuminating to see how difficult the "legal" immigration process is. For two educated, relatively well-off, English-speaking people to struggle so much with this process - I can't imagine how hard this process is for people who aren't as lucky.
Congratulations bbb!!!
Im so happy for you, congrats Kayak! Kinda feels like a stab in my heart tho, now that im going through a breakup and have to accept that he wasnt the one.. Hope i will find something like you guys have in the future
As someone who works in immigration, I can tell you the NVC has never even once worked quickly. They also lose paperwork and keep stuff long enough that certifications lapse.
Wonderful news! Congratulations!!
So happy for you!
i need help what the heck when did she announce that she's engaged? is this the announcement?
You did this too close to April Fool’s I thought this was a joke at first...
Me and my now husband went the other way for moving me from the US to the UK. We managed to squeak in before COVID-times with me getting into the UK and taking up the residency to get married. So I'm glad you managed to get yours finally settled!
They look so much alike tho 👀
This is so damn cuteeeee🥰❤️
I'm so happy for you both. Finger crosed that this process will be finished soon. All the best to u both!
Yayyyyy
Congratulations! So excited for you guys!
I am so so excited for you two ! 😍👏🏻
im so happy you did this video because my boyfriend lives in the US and i have no idea how this would work if we were to want to get married, i just stopped thinking about it because i was like well yknow covid travel ban uk, cant go anywhere i'll shelf this idea and then its been a while now so i started to get real sad and yeah im rambling but thank you this is so helpful
Congratulations 🥰
What happened to her lips? Ew
Congratulations!
did anyone have subtitles and any time she said covid it said covet covent or kovit
Yay good news for you! :) I know, how exciting and stressful this k1 visa process is. Been there  done that . 1 year of preparing, and 10 months from applying to finally hold the visa in hand and finally being able to see each other again.  And theeen 6 months for the Greencard . As u mentioned "90 day fiance" TV show. I hate how they portray it. It looks like a trash show. Sad, they dont show the actual real and raw times, how its going down. How it is to live countries apart, long distance relationship, visa updates, last months in your hometown, packing and saying goodbye to friends and family, entering the new country for thr 1st time and so ooooon and oooooon. Ppl who don't experience this crazy ride, unfortunately don't understand at all what u r going thru. Anyways so cool to hear, yall are 2 hearts from 2 different countries ! America requires alot. I know lol I actually used to make Youtube Videos to help ppl through this process. If u have any questions... Ohh and yesss, I checked the Visa Status daily as well, until it finally got updated! :) Good luck! ♡
wow i've been hear since kayak was a young 16 year old dealing with susan
You should blog the courthouse wedding or have your witness film for us😂
I smell a MexiVaca in your near future!!!!
Congratulations Kayla and Dan!! 💕
Congratulations we hope it comes quickly
Guuuuurl, my partner is from the US and I'm Australian. Applying for the Aussie one is $8000 excluding lawyers, health check, marriage/registering relationship.. and takes YEARS. Can't wait for the American one as it sounds chill af 😅
I'm very happy for you.
yay!!! thats so exciting!!! congrats
So what happens if by the time he gets processed, the 2 years since you’ve seen each other gets surpassed? Does the travel ban allow you an exemption from having seen each other in that long?
This brings back so much horror from my own experience having met and married someone met via internet. That was back in 2000. Then, after we got married... 9/11 happened. And even though he was Belgian born and raised... the processing time for his green card went from 3 months to a never ending cycle of horror. Good luck, Kayla. Or just move to the UK.
Congrats! 🕊💕
YUHHHHH
90 Day Fiance is one of my favorite shows so I appreciate you breaking down the process. I hope all goes smoothly!
This might me a dumb question, but does this mean that Dan cannot stream in the US until he obtains his work visa and green card?
CONGRATS!!!!!!!
I thought she is 15....
CONGRATS!!!!! <3 <3 <3
So happy for you both! I don't know if there's lots of differences between Canadian and US immigration processes, but, one of my bestfriends went and got married to someone in Kenya about a year or so ago, they're currently in the immigration process of getting him to Canada and its been a huuuuge issue for my bestfriend. The amount they've had to pay for lawyers to even just get legal advice is ridiculous. I see how discouraging it has been for her and her partner, LDRs are not easy at all. Excited for you guys, can only imagine the worries you're both facing. Best of luck to the both of you!!
Congrats!
Hey Simsie! I have been through the K-1 Visa From the UK to the USA. The doctor's office (Knightsbridge) in London are really good. I'm on the 2 year Green Card, gotta sort out the 10 year one. Been here for 5 years now.
This video made me smile so much. You are so gitty and I can just imagine how happy you will be when he finally gets to come to the USA. I know how hard this process is, and I think it's so beautiful that you guys have made it so far. You're almost at the finish line! Congratulations to you both <3
I absolutely love how you started saying how different the reality is compared to 90 day fiance. I've been married for 4 years on k1 visa and I ALWAYS get sooooo frustrated with the show when they make it like they are trying to get to know each other in that 90 days. *eye roll* We married at the court the next weekend after arrival because you don't want to risk a delay and then your fiance is sent back!  Congratulations on getting the interview it is such a big deal! 💕💕💕
Visas are so stressful. I work in Mexico for a Dr. Volunteering program, I met my husband here and we were waiting for the year to be over, than Covid happened. So I feel your pain girl. The marriage affidavit is so annoying. Since Im japanese american and grew up in Japan its been crazy.
i totally get the struggle of your entire future being in the hands of the government. i’m a military fiancé and it’s scary knowing your entire future is in the hands of the military. we don’t even know when or where he’s going to be stationed yet. it’s so rough
Congrats 👏🏻
Congrats Kayla! 🥳
no im engaged... IN UR VIDEOS!!
I'm from Australia and my sister and brother in law moved to the US 10 years ago, lots of forms and lots of waiting. One of my nieces still doesn't have an Australian passport because when she was 3 they insisted on speaking to 'the applicant'. visa processes are rough
AAAA
Congrats!
Congrats omgsh I feel your pain to some degree. My partner is Danish and I am about to start my master's in Canada. As a Canadian I can visit Denmark for about 3 months at a time and same for him in Canada without any visa. So we may just do that for awhile to avoid all this marriage visa stuff cuz it's a huge pain as everyone wants to move to Denmark but it's a tiny country lol. COVID has made this all 10x harder and it was dang hard to begin with.
Girl, I had to renew my green card in 2019 so when the pandemic happened I was not happy. My new green card hadn't even come yet, but I could already apply for citizenship, that's just how USCIS works lol I spent thousands on this whole case, so I knew the second I can get my citizenship and be done and over it I'd apply. And in 20 days I have my citizenship test!! It only takes a lot out of you to get everything started, once you send em papers you're gonna be chillin'. Hang tight  (also, my work permit was eaten by my dog, so yeah, they don't give you a new one)
Congrats! I'm so happy for you and I hope you life goes well together!
I haven't seen my partner in over a year because of similar travel restrictions (I'm American, they're Australian) and I just sympathize so much with your situation. I can't wait to hopefully make my way to Australia and see the person I love again. So so so so so happy for you and Dan!!
Wow an engaged 12 year old! Jokes congrats on the engagement
Congratulations ❤❤🎉
Congratulations!! 🎉
When i first watched her she had like 20k and was a senior in high school 😭😭😭
Congrats
Congratulations 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Do like a pre honeymoon in Mexico together
Hey, really happy for you two! Thank you for explaining all the process and how much it cost, it's actually really helpful. I am in a similar situation, dating someone from the US while being in Belgium and we honestly weren't sure how all of it would go if we would get to that stage at some point, so it's really insightful. The pandemic really doesn't help anything, but I'm glad it's progressing for you at least! Best of luck!

I adjusted from an F1 to marriage visa and omg it’s stressful. Also I got a receipt about adjusting my status yesterday... I sent the paperwork in in October 2020 and didn’t hear anything from them... except for the fact that they cashed our check 😹
good for you im happy for you
your audio on this video is a bit out of sync with your mouth xD its tripping me out
congrats!!
Oh my goodness that’s so exciting, especially after all that paperwork and waiting time. Also really interesting learning about how visas work in the US 🤩💖
awesomeee!! congrats ❤️
Congratulations!   So I do absolutely not agree with the government controlling marriages... however, I wish couples would take half the time you two have to get everything together to get married... I'm just saying
Congratulations. About 8 years ago my ex fiance and I were thinking of going through this process. We were together for 5 years before he passed away. I remember it was a head ache. So happy for you!
I REMEMBER WHEN SHE WAS 14 WHAT-
LIL, please, I'm a Brazilian fiancé of and U.S. citizen which also filled the K1 in Feburary last yearm just like you! Can you, PLEASE, send us the contact or website of the lawyers you talked to, PLEASE?  We're also going crazy making plans of moving our case to a non-banned country under the P.P. 10413 etc. but if joining the lawsuit is that fast I'm interested on having a look too! And congratulations! P.S.: I know how you feel in all the ways! hahah
Awww love you, congratulations! ❤️
Finally im so happy for u guys!
$4k for a visa, not to mention the cost of a wedding which should be spectacular, cause you deserve it
OMg cholesterol
I think it's crazy that your letters expired. I don't think that should've happened since the pandemic isn't your fault. I have papers that have expiry dates but are getting a pass because of the pandemic.
I am so happy for you and your fiance! Hearing how happy and excited you are bringing a smile to my face!!!!!!! ❤️
So happy for you😊💖 Can also relate to this and all long distance relationships atm... My partner is also another country and bec covid we were able to see last time on july and this is heartbraking to be apart without any clue when your able to see. Sending strengt to all of us💗
Congratulations! 😊❤️
Congratulations
Kayla exposing 90 day fiance .. but i will say, the process is so much more complicated than people think. I am also engaged to someone not a citizen in the US, so it's such a confusing and expensive journey to go through.
Omg I just got engaged too on the first!! Congratulations!!
CONGRATULATIONS OMG
My husband is from England and we had to go through the same process so I feel your pain on all this. Congrats!!!!
Congratulations !
Congratulations 🎉 ❤️
Congratulations ♥️ 👏 ♥️
My fiancé is also from England and we have been going through the immigration process for over a year. Feels like there’s no end in sight sometimes. So difficult not being able to see the love of your life. It’s so complicated and I feels so alone so often as there is no one around me who understands what we’re going through. If anyone sees this and is going through the same process, I could use a friend and some support
New Subscriber
WHAT CONGRATULATIONS
Congratulations to you both x
Well I hope Dan can move soon!  I would love to move to the USA but immigration there is unnecessarily complicated, they barely let anyone in and then wonder why they have so many illegal immigrants....just sayin’. It’s ridiculous!! And it’s making me depressed.
Covid was not the major cause of your visa being delayed. Trump is! It all relates back to his proclamation at the beginning of the pandemic. For some background, I got married in Europe to my American husband and applied for a CR1 Visa in Sept. 2020 and got my interview in Jan. 2021!  So yes, K1 Visas were unlawfully not being processed while other visas were being processed regardless of the pandemic! I am glad you and your fiance finally got the interview, though!
CONGRATS CONGRATS CONGRATS CONGRATS CONGRATS CONGRATS!!!!!!!!!
The west coast of Turkey is stunningly beautiful. I go almost every year! :D
A lot of people just get married quickly and immigrate due to that, and save on the hassle with the visa
OMGOMG AGGHH
This makes me so happy! Kayla and Dan deserve the best and I'm glad they're getting the opportunity to finally reunite for good! :)
I hope that you both will have a nice long, happy life together!!! <3 congrats!
Yess I’m so happy for you guys! ❤️❤️  Congratulations 🎉
as someone who was engaged to a man from scotland i feel all of this .. ultimately its what caused us to not work out but i'm really happy for you so congrats :)
Woot Woot Congratulations ♥️
omg im so happy for u ive been watching u since u were in hs i cant believe ur getting married ahh <3 u guys are so cute :3
Oh my gosh. That sounds sooo nerve-wracking! I'm so sorry you guys have to go through this. I'm so happy you're gonna finally be with your love. Let me tell you, as a newlywed myself, living with your best friend and partner is so worth any of the trouble. It's gonna feel like pure bliss. Congrats and we will be waiting patiently for those beautiful photos! 💖
met my current bf the same way! he wasn't going to move here till later but because covid was starting  we got scared and he drove from OK to FL right as all the bans were starting. and no where near as bad as ur case but it was so scary thinking omg what if the next state closes their border and he's stuck here. (which was almost the case cuz Louisiana closed so he had to come in threw Georgia.) <3 congrats sorry its taken so long, I'm sure ya'll are so anxious. if u need to stay in Mexico there are resorts that u can stay at that cover food, bed and transportation. so pre honeymoon? lol
congrats ❤️
Such a lovely video :) I've just uploaded a new one too :)
CONGRATULATIONS! YOU DESERVE IT YOU QUEEN!!!!
Yes it does take a lot of money to move to the US. And some visas require people to have 500k LIQUID to move here. Yet, Americans will buy into the "poor immigrant from nothing" stories. Lulz. Most are not poor.
Yaaay.
Steph0Sins and PlumBitch better be maid of honors
My art teacher is going through a very similar thing. Her fiancé is from the Netherlands and they actually planned to visit over spring break (ours started right at the same time as the travel ban :/) so they couldn’t. She decided to start making drawings for other couples who are going through the same thing and she says that it has been helping with some of the stress to know she’s making other people feel better :) congrats!
Omg congrats!!
My gosh i have been so invested in this for months and i dont even know you personally
Well, seeing how they handle the pandemic here in Europe... you probably want to plan for these 14 days quarantine in Mexico. We are so many so tiny countries and two or three countries (Germany included) are f*ing up so badly handling this pandemic so we will probably be travel banned for a looooong time...
also England doesnt stop raining so you've made the right choice....
awww this is fab.
Congratulations!! 🎉🎉🎉 hope you see each other soon
Congratulations ❤️❤️
Congrats 💜
Congratulations ❤️❤️
When they say he can’t work, does that include like twitch/internet earnings? Or just that he can’t apply for a physical job in the US?
Honestly find you a guy that is willing to give up free healthcare for you 😁🙈
Congratulations 🎉🎊🍾
😍😍😍
2020 isnt that long ago....some people wait 5 years or more. But congratulations!!!
YOOOOOOO
Our life is always in the hands of the government, dear... unfortunately
Just go to Mexico or whatever together!
Congratulations 🎉🍾🎈 ❤️
Im so glad things are moving forward!!! I cant wait for Dan to FINALLY arrive in the Us for yall to be together ❤❤
Girl, you‘re way too young.
Congrats!!!
Me and now husband sent out papers in January 2020 got step 2 got approved in March. Ours was stuck at nvc still til this day our papers expired in steptember 2020 but I quit my full time job of 8 years and went to him in the Netherlands and we got married in October 2020 like we planned and I officially moved here in January and last month I got my residential card here
CONGRATS KAYLA 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
congratulations kayla 🤍🤍
what the heck is a biometrics fee?
3) suggestion:  can Dan maybe stay in Australia with Deli and James?
1) that's a cute sweater!  2) I'm kvelling over here for the two of you.  I hope this means his travel will be expedited.
OH MY GOD
Congratulations!! My husband and I did this and we started in 2018 and finally he just got his green card in March 2021! I hope COVID doesn’t push things back for you! Good luck and god bless and I’m happy for you! CANT wait to see them together
YAYYYY
CONGRATS LEGENDS
Hey congrats for the interview! I've never gone through K-1 visa, but I've applied my green card through marriage and now I'm in the process of switching my green card to 10 year one from 2 year one. Your boyfriend is so lucky to have you that does so much research and so commit to it. I wish my husband was like you cuz it was just me working so hard collecting all the paperwork and stuff. Hope all the immigration process ahead of you will be smooth!
Congratulations 🍾 I’m so sorry this process has been a nightmare bit so glad you are seeing progress!!
They looked related in the thumbnail 😭
honestly learning so much
CONGRATS
💚💚💚💚💚
Congrats Kayla!!
CONGRATULATIONS AHH
OMG
i was like “wait.. you were on 90 day fiancé??!” 🤣
YAYY
Congrats, Kayla!
Congrats! My husband and I went through this whole visa process! It's very frustrating and nerve wracking. We got ours before Covid thankfully but the whole process still took over 3 years for us. Wishing you the best of luck! As long as you can get the travel bans worked out though, the rest of the process should be fairly smoothly for you guys. Small note: the money you have to make for the visa in the US is 125% over the national poverty line based on the amount of people in your family, and they are EXTREMELY picky on that. Our visa was delayed for about a month simply because my husband and I were 3k short based on the previous tax return and they wouldn't accept my current paycheck stubs which my income that year was actually over the limit so my parents had to sponsor him jointly with me if our income fell below that amount which basically they signed a paper saying they would support us for the rest (aka $0 money).
Congrats 🎉🎊 so excited for you guys. Hopefully they get the process done quickly.
Wow, this process is crazy. Now imagine that being twice as hard if you’re from a “s*@thole” country (as a 🍊 man once said) and poor.  That being said I’m so happy for you.
am i too high or is she actually explaining this really well lmfao
Congratulations :)
OMG... Congrats
NO WAYYYYY AH CONGRATS!!!!!❤️😼🤚
Congratulations that’s awesome!
this gives me hope for the future 👉👈 maybe one day I will be with my partner
As someone who has been through the visa process all I can say is patience is so hard but key for sanity and good luck -- we met through mutual online friends as well, so there's a nervousness still attached to that answer when it comes to "how did you meet"! My husband originally came from Canada to the US on a student visa and then we went through the fiancé visa process (luckily he could stay in the US while we waited because he was still on the student visa, but if he was denied so would the student visa so any day he could have been told to go back to Canada) We actually applied for the 10-year green card in February 2020 as well and it took nearly all year -- takes time but once you get the good news all that fades away!
look at you!! i'm so proud!!
CONGRADUTIONS!!!! You should build your wedding hall in the sims🤎
Congratulations on the engagement! Hope all goes well!
I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!
Congratulations!!!🎈
So excited for you!!!
So july-august simsie will be married and living with her soon-to-be-husband? Mark your calendars people
Congratulations! I'm so happy for you! I'm sure you and Dan are both happy to finally see a light at the end of this particularly long tunnel.
Congrats!   Go to Mexico with him for 2 week vacation :)
Congrats 🥰
Congratulations! My fiance is also from England and have gone through this whole process as well! Its soo long lol, I cant even imagine going through this during Covid. Were currently in the I-751 process to remove conditions and, its basically a second K1 packet lol good tip is to save all those documents! :) Good luck to you both❤🤗
MAMMAMAMA AHHH
Congratulations!!!!
it’s amazing how i’ve watched her since she was a junior and now she’s getting engaged 🥺
Wow you two look like siblings!
Congratulations to the both of you. I hope everything works out.
I’m so happy for u two!!! Is it bad that I just happy cried??😂😂
So so happy for you! This is the best news you can hear in a long distance relationship, I'd love to be able to email you and get all the information needed for the K1 Visa as my fiancè and I are trying to do the same thing ❤
Omg whattt😳omg congrats
Thats amazing!! Hope the process doesn't last forever. I cant wait to see a ring and photos!

The government really pisses me off
AHHHH KAYLA!!!! IM SO EXCITED FOR YOU!!! I grew up watching you, from way when you were in highschool to now... can't believe you're engaged! and one day you'll be calling him "my husband," AWW! So so happy for you, love you so much <3

Congrats!! 🤍
congrats!!!
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!
Good luck Kayla :)
WOOHOO CONGRATS SIMSIE SO EXCITED FOR YALL
Hi Kayla! I am a photographer from the midwest who travels throughout the US if you and Dan are searching for an engagement/wedding photographer in the future. :-) My website is my name plus the word photography, dot com. :)))
AAAAAAA CONGRATULATIONS!!! IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!
Awww yay sp happy for yall!!!!
Thank you for being so open and honest with us especially down to the nitty gritty of expenses with this kind of thing. I just recently finished watching the 2nd season of 90DF and from how it looks, the show makes it seem that it is an easy process to obtain a "fiance Visa." And congratulations on your engagement and the best of wishes and happiness to you two of a life of together!
Good luck! I got my green card through the London embassy many years ago and they lost all our paperwork 🤦🏻‍♀️ I had to sit there before my interview and redo it all! Fun times. My interview on how I met my husband was fun to tell them as he had found me on Facebook and stalked me lol!! Will he become a citizen or just a green card holder?
Congratulations Kayla!!! Hope it all goes well! Just keep at it girl, we’re here for you!
When did that happen congratulations
Congrats! I hope that all goes realy well
Me and my austraian husband went through this and he's been here for 5 years now... it was hell back then! I can't imagine trying to to do this during the pandemic!!!! Also.. congrats!
Congratulations! When I was watching the speed build I was like “rewind! I know she didn’t just say fiancé!!” But I’m confused. Are you actually engaged, did he propose or is it just for the visa?
Congratulations I'm so happy for you two
Congratulations
I knew someone had to be beating them dunnies
CONGRATULATIONS!!! I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS!!! I can't believe 13 year old Kayla is getting married 😭😭😭
My husband and I finally have our Green Card interview after waiting for a year. We were lucky tho cause I got to stay in the US during my Adjustment of Status. Congrats to you guys, it's definitely not easy!
Why in the heck is there soo many thumbs down on an engagement announcement! CONGRATS KAYLA!! I'M SOOO EXCITED FOR YOU!
Europe isn't a country -.- haha
My British husband named Daniel just got green card notification after 16 months of marriage. I feel this. The visa process is SOOOO stressful!!! Good luck in the time ahead! I wish I could say it gets easier/less stressful. (our interview was a breeze, hope yours is too)  I suggest the chapel of the flowers in Vegas for the wedding. We rented the dress and we basically just showed up but it felt like a realer wedding than the courthouse.
I'm sorry you have to go through this.
congrats girly <3
CONGRATULATIONSSSS!!!  This reminds me so much of all the work I had to do when I sponsored my husband, although we are in Canada. It takes as much time, money and effort. I also got obsessed with reasearching everything and answering people' questions.
Congrats!!!!
HOLY CRAP on the last legacy challenge video I commented, "I am just waiting for simise to announce she is getting engaged, (for real this time)"
Congrats! I went through the K1 process and just had my permanent residence/Green Card interview last week and have been approved! There’s light at the end of the looooooong tunnel :’)
this is the most educational engagement announcement i’ve ever seen. congratulations on the visa hell ideally hopefully soon being over! i’m really happy for y’all
My step brother has been waiting almost 3 years for his WIFE to be able to come here from the Philippines. She finally just had her medical exam and the final interview is usually the next day. She could finally be here in the next month!
I feel you, i haven‘t seen my boyfriend for almost 7 months bc of covid.. 7 months from only 2 1/2 years of relationship
Congrats!! Oh god I hope all goes well. My husband and I are trying to just gather the money to apply for his residency and these applications are scary. Hoping everything goes as planned
Didn't watch the video but I've watched enough vids in my time to stop and say CONGRATULATIONS!! You deserve that and more. ☺️
Congrats, Kayla. You deserve all the good things
FINALLY!!! yayyy congratulations❤️
Congrats!!
Congratulations!   are they two of you going to be on the 90 day Finance TV show?
OH MY GOD THIS IS AMAZING
YAY CONGRATULATIONS
I feel ya, I did this but reverse ( USA to the UK) We got married and then bam a week later lockdown came so we got extremely lucky. The visa process is exhausting but it pays off when you get to be together x Glad your process is finally moving forward!
AHHHHH
Congrats Lilsimie!
congrats lilsimsie.
ahh i’m crying i’m so happy congrats!!!
Seriously if you wanna talk about it let me know because the visa process is hard and no one gets it also being separated is the worst and I hope these next few months fly by!
Are you gonna change your name to lilduck?
YAYYYY CONGRATS!!!
bro this is epiccc
Omg congrats 🥺❤️
Congratulation to the both of you ❤
Congrats!! My fiance is Canadian and moving from the US to Canada is no treat either. Good Luck!!
It's so bad you can't get retroactive credit and instead of waiting 3 to 5 to get married you could be celebrating your five year anniversary! I hope everything works out for you two! I'm looking forward to this!
Europe is not a country
Omg yasss gurrll
Yay! Congratulations! I'm so happy for you.
Aw tell him to come to Australia it’s pretty safe here now
congrats!!!! so happy for you ♡
Congratulations Kayla I'm so happy for youuuuu 😭💜💜💜💜💜
One of my best friends is Canadian and she ended up marrying one of my other best friends after they met through me, we're both American. The process of her getting a visa to get married took like two years and it was so hurry up and wait and also a lot of weird stuff about how much time she was allowed to spend in America but she also had to spend a minimum amount of time so she was flying back and forth from America and Canada like every few months while planning a wedding (I help, I was basically her proxy when she was in Canada). It was so much fun lol /sarcasm. Good luck and congrats! Hope it all goes as smoothly as it can
OH- MY GOD OH.MY.GOD CONGRATSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS IM SO HAPPY FOR YOOU
Is Dan going to have to stop streaming whilst he cant work in the US?
Congrats! A friend has been going through the same process and their application got approved in February, but there's still like 12 more steps with that embassy before her husband (they got married in his home country last year and will have a wedding here eventually) can get here. I'm so glad you guys have an interview date! I'm not sure they have that yet.
Congratulations!!!!
Congrats☺️❤
Hi, I think he can quarantine in Serbia (as far as I know). I know people are flying to US form Belgrade (Serbia's Capital). And a + is that it is super cheap here.
aussi moche l un que l autre
Congratulations💚💛💙
Oh honey I'm so happy for you!!
Congratulations 👏❤️💗
OMG CONGRATS KAYAK🥰🥰🥰
Mazeltov!!!! :)
Congrats that this didn't take a million more years!!! I am genuinely happy for you guys tho.😁❤❤❤
Ahh I went through the same damn thing but I moved to Italy and got married ASAP in order to get my residency and stay, it was ROUGH
This video reminded me how poor my knoweledge is about the world and the law lol Congrats btw 💕
Wait? how old are you?
I really like you but Please! Remember that Europe is not a whole country! There are a lot of countries! And saying that Europe is country is a really big misunderstanding!  Anyway congrats and have a happy life with him! :D I hate my phone's keyboard -_-'
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️congrats
Congrats! So happy for you both after this long distant relationship (I know how hard it is) and this huge administration adventure 🥰😊
Congratulations

Congrats ! - and well i guess we can wait untill he actualy gets there for the whole photo story :) - and i think getting the marriage sorted out paperwise for now , while postponing the party and co for when you can actually fully enjoy it is always a good idea
Congratulationas❤️❤️❤️❤️
“Not ALL countries are banned, just some like Europe ...” sorry I- 😭 I love you but that was too funny
So happy for you Kayla! Glad you finally got some good news!!
Well done!!!!!!!!! Congratulations, so happy for you.
YAYAYAY, CONGRATS!! hope everything goes well!
Congratulations! I'm going through a lot of struggle being in a relationship with someone in another country. I've had to keep pushing off plans to finally meet because of all the travel restrictions in place. Still having to look at another year of waiting unfortunately. Glad to hear this is finally moving forward for you guys! So exciting!
Congratulations 🎉❤️
My fiancé is from America and I'm from Sweden. I haven't seen him since January 5th, 2020, we'd so many plans about getting engaged and stuff during the summer last year so we could get the visa process started but obviously, all the flights kept getting canceled and I haven't been able to see him since the pandemic started. It's felt kind of comforting seeing you and Dan in the same boat as us because it felt less lonely. He has a ring with him but I haven't seen it yet because he wants to keep it a surprise. We're currently planning a wedding we'll have in Sweden next year and then we'll do the spouse visa after that. I'm gonna be sending out save the dates soon and people don't even know I'm engaged yet because we haven't been able to see each other in over a year lmao. but I'm so happy things are starting to move along for you guys!!
OMG CONGRATS BESTIE💕💕💕💕💕💕
OMG YES CONGRATULATIONS!!! 🎉 You guys look so cute together🥺i hope you guys will have a big family!
Did ... did you just call Europe a country?  (also congrats <3)
Aww omg! I’m so happy for you congrats! How exciting.
Congratulations!! I'm wishing you guys a ton of luck! The process is such a headache.
Omg, can’t believe u might see him again so soon hopefully🥺❤️ I’m so excited for the both of u, and I wish u the best of luck with the rest of the process. And fingers crossed travel bans is not a thing this summer/autumn anymore and that the pandemic is more or less over🥺❤️❤️ Have to add, watching u being so excited over this also proves how much u actually love Dan, and I really admire that. It’s beautiful to watch❤️
Wow, that is expensive. I guess it's a good thing EA will be sending you codes for the $4000 worth of Sims 4 Kits they plan to release this year.
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!
Congrats <3
Yay congrats!! And thank you for the story and info. I had no clue about the process! That is so crazy. I hope it finishes quickly :)
Congrats gorl
Dude not sure how your education works in America but in Canada we have to go through citizen test and look at all the visas while role-playing as an immigrant for a work visa, for an engagement/marriage visa, and refugee visa/status to see if we would be able to become a Canadian citizen. But here in Alberta we also have to do the same thing using the American system to look at the contrast and similarities. GO CANADA🇨🇦🇨🇦
Could you photoshop them?
I think this is the first time I have ever commented on one your videos. I remember watching you when you were talking about high school now your engaged. I’m not going to cry promise I’m happy for you and hope everything goes well!
Congratulations! Europe is not a country though... 😉
Congratulations~! My husband and I are waiting for a spousal visa interview currently. I totally understand the struggles of going through the visa process during covid
<3
Kayla my boyfriend and I are in the exact same boat as you <33 times are tough but we got this !!
I screamed so loud when u said ‘my fiancé’, so happy for u guys and hope y’all get through this process as quickly as possible!!
can’t get over the fact that we have to pay the government money just to get married
Serious question, how will his twitch channel work? Will that count as work if he makes money from it? Will he have to take a 9 month break?
AWWWWWW
i've literally been following you since you were in high school and now you're engaged :" congrats kayla!! so happy for you!!!
So Happy for you. Thanks for sharing your news with us all. My friends got married in a small legal ceremony last year and they are doing the wedding party again this year for all their family and friends.
HAPPY FOR YOU :)
Congratulations 🥳
Congratulations to you and Dan!! I’m glad that you were able to get in on that lawsuit so that most of your paperwork and fees were still valid.  I’m excited that you should be able to see each other somewhat soon!
I always get the "why didn't you move to the UK"... I have a child, it doesn't make sense for me to move the two of us, instead of the one of him.. But it caused so many delays... we were told we have to start the whole process over.
Congrats!
Congratulations!! 🥳❤
Aww congrats! This was a really interesting look into a process I knew nothing about. Wishing y'all the best <3
Congratulations but why would he want to move to the US instead of the other way around? The states is horrible for health care and treatment of its citizens, I'm surprised you guys would opt to stay instead of visa versa.   Congrats either way, just shocked anyone willingly wants to remain in that madness of a country. I guess it's different when you're white and rich, idk.
Wow similar to my husband and I... He's from England, and he visited for three months at a time a few times. We went a lot quicker beginning the process since it takes ages, but the same thing is there. Congratulations! The process is indeed so long and stressful. He should be getting his permanent resident with restrictions lifted soon, but it's been taking ages. But doesn't feel nearly as bad as the 14 months it took him to immigrate.
Ugh be a role model not a trainwreck. Set an example. This is so sad.
Congratulations Kayla ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🎉
Congratulations!! Wish you love and prosperity ❤
7 years ago. I did go through the same process. So long it took like 7 month from the applying to having the interview. Then we had a month to prepare a small church wedding.
I forgot to say congratulations when I watched this but now I say it lmao
I love this content, I’m in such a similar position and it’s so encouraging to hear about movement with the government chaos hahaha
I can see how excited you are and so happy for you both.  I had a friend in Michigan and her boyfriend was in Canada....literally across the border and they couldn't see each other.  I was crying happy tears when I saw their wedding photos, it was awesome.  I'm so excited for you guys!!
Whatever the 90 days fiancé advertised (I haven't seen it) seems to have screwed up a lot of people's perceptions of K1 visas. A close family friend once called my mom a prostitute for being a K1 visa immigrant. It broke my heart because otherwise that women is very sane. I hope this video educated a lot of people about what this process is like, because lilsimsie described it really really well.
lol when i started doing my makeup i did it exactly like you did yours in this vid and it was inspired by you so thx love you!
oh my god im so happy for you im crying i love you so much and congrats!!!
YAY SIMSIE
Congrats!!!
Congratulations, Kayla!
I hope you both will be together very soon <3 Congratulations! Also thankyou for sharing this information, i found it so interesting.
Congrats
💕
so happy for u
YAY KAYLA!!
Congratulations! ❤
Congrats, Kayla, you won the capitalist path!   The money for paperwork only is crazy... So happy for the two of you! With a fixed date waiting might get just a liiiittle bit easier. At least I hope so. Thanks for this video! <3
Ahhh congrats! I have been watching since your senior year of high school and now you are getting married. 😢 I feel so old.
AAAAHH CONGRATS
Congratulations and best wishes to both of you.
AHHHHHH!!!!! I'M SO EXCITED!!!!!!! Thank heaven you finally have some news!! I'm partying over here for you! Woohoo!! Congrats!!! <3 <3 <3 I'm so glad you joined that 3rd round. Crazy!

Congratulations 🎉 🎊 👏 🎉 🎊 👏 So happy for you both. Hope the rest is an expedited process. Or at the least goes 1000× smoother for the both of you.

Congrats !!🍾
awesome video!!! wish you the best <3
So so so happy for you !! This is so exciting and i feel like my best friend just gave me a life update ! So happy for you kayla
My husband and I were also 90 day fiances, we have been married since January 2020 and we finally got his green card last month. Congratulations to you and Dan, I hope your process goes as smoothly as possible!
My parents got married at the courthouse while my mom was pregnant with me and then had their wedding on my first birthday
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!! That is so exciting, I'm so glad this is finally moving for you!!!
i didn’t even know you had a boyfriend 🤭
Can he chill in Canada for two weeks?
Aww! Congratulations guys! Good luck with immigration and I hope it goes smoothly ❤️
Ohhh hun i understand you struggle!!! I moved to the UK in november 2019, i cant imagine what my life would be like if i hadnt seen my bf for all this time!! :O Im soo happy for you both! <3 <3
WHAT
Omg immigrating is a nightmare. I'm immigrating to the US from Canada and it's awful. I kind of decided to move on a whim because as a Native American I can have duel citizenship in America and Canada and my living situation was dangerous. The process is so bad. I submitted my application in November, got my biometrics done in January and they asked for paperwork (which I had given them initially but they didn't take it because that just makes too much sense) and now I'm just waiting to hear back. Anyone I call to ask for an update, they don't know how the process is for Native Americans immigrating to America so nobody ever has answers for me. It makes me want to rip my hair out sometimes.
Congrats!!!
I wanted to dislike this out of jealousy, but even after watching you for 6 months, you are my spastic redheaded sister who plays The Sims, like me.   Congratulations to you and that bastage, Dan (like his name tho')
I know this is a sims channel but if you wanted to make a ton of wedding content... I’m here for it👀
The last stream I watched was when you first said when you were going to do a visa video... Um, lol, that was like 4 months ago
This is CRAZY!!! I cannot imagine going through that. And congrats!!!
When I saw this!!!! I'm so so so happy for you nerd love omg
Congrats!! Canadian here... I believe we're not banned from UK travel or US travel. He could probably quarantine here but we have mandatory quarantine hotels and they're expensive and also garbage. Best of luck!! Keep us updated. ❤️
Congrats on your engagement! If he needs to stay elsewhere to "quarantine" for entry, maybe he could go to Canada? I imagine since it is still part of the commonwealth maybe it would be easier? Wishing you guys all the best!
I'm so happy for you guys and that you finally have progress on the process ❤️
I feel you ! I have applied for residency visa through my fiancé and it takes it sooooo long ugh
WHAT
OMG
OMG congratssssss I’m so happy for you, Kayla. ❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations 💕❤️ This is AMAZING news 😍👏🏻💕💖
Omg ❤❤ Congrats ❤❤
CONGRATS!! 💖💖💖💖💖💖
I got married on a k1 too (USA/canada) congratulations and good luck with the whole process!
Congratulations ❤️
Why did I think you were 16
1:20 kayla, omg you lied to us...
Wow
Congratulations!! Hopefully it goes smoothly from here 💕
I am in the process for my green card right now!! It’s so hard hahaha
OMG I'M SHOOK this is such a clash of worlds right now!! We also applied for the K1 in Jan 2020 and were stuck at NVC and joined the 2nd round lawsuit and have our interview in London next week!!! SO EXCITING!!!!!
omg this is so exciting! so happy for you and can't imagine the amount of happiness and excitement you feel for this :-)
but wait, do you have a story of how he proposed?
I am so happy for you <3
Congrats!!! I know that the process is long but it will be worth it!
The quarantine is hurting so many people. I'm european and I haven't seen my boyfriend, who lives in the US, for about a year and 4 months. We've been together for 4 years. I am still desperately trying to find solutions to see him.. if you've heard of one, please let me know. Thank you Keyla for representing our struggle!
Congratulation! I am here with the K1 Visum now Greencard (actually today 9 years on the day) and know how much there is to do ....sooooo much forms and so much money....., but the worst was the waiting. Oh yes I remember the refreshing of the uscis site and the waiting of the mail later. The current situation makes it worse. At least you don't have a language barrier, well kind of lol. The interview is not bad, our story was so crazy that I was worried, he just has to tell the truth. I wish you both a happy marriage.
Wait wait wait wait you got an interview!? I am still waiting for mine! 😭💖 same last year, March I got accepted and all they need is interview but covid forbid me!
I’m so happy for you guys!
So he’s not even allowed to make money through twitch/YouTube when he moves? Seems tough!
I WAS AWAY FROM THE INTERNET FOR A COUPLE DAYS AND SHE’S ENGAGED!?!?!?!?! Congrats tho
I keep forgetting kayla isn't a 12 anymore
Wait, i were thinking that you are teenager lmao 😂
i didnt knew you can get engaged with 12 ....
Hello Kayla,  I have been following you for a few months for sims related videos, they are really fun to watch! I only fairly knew that you have a partner, and I don't have twitch it any other platform you're on, so I really don't know if you've talked about it in the past, but how did you keep your head and spirit and the spirit of your relationship up during this hard time? I haven't seen my partner because of pandemic travel restrictions for now 13 months, we were planning to get married too, instead his Country doesn't allow any citizens to leave, for any reason whatsoever. I have been really sinking in the past few months of continuous "lockdown only until end of November, no wait, mid December, no wait, and of December, no wait, mid of January.." until now, a total shutdown being anticipated here, and no news from there. I am truly happy to hear that your case is moving on, progressing in a positive way!! I wish you all the luck on your way, a smooth as possible moving in together.  Happy Easter and stay healthy 🌹
Congratulations y’all! 🎉
That‘s so exciting ❤️ Congratulations!
Congratulations! That’s amazing news. Watching this has helped ease my mind a little bit with my own situation. My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half. We went to high school together and had classes together. We became best friends and started dating our senior year. We both want to get married one day, it’s just hard trying to figure out the where and when and how because we are both active duty Air Force and are being stationed at different bases. We’ve been apart for a year now. We’re waiting for us both to finish training then we’ll try to meet up together to figure things out and do a process in the military called “join spouse.” So that we could hopefully get stationed at the same base together once we are legally married. It’s so hard being away from him especially because I use to see him every single day. But we make it work and I’ve only ever loved him more and more. Your video has given me more hope that him and I will get through this even if it takes quite some time to get it all figured out and situated. ❤️
Omg I’m so happy for you!!
Congrats Kayla! 🥂
This sounds so much like my story at the beginning lol. I'm so happy for you! I'm still waiting for my boyfriend to meet the income requirements and covid has made it basically impossible to do anything to move towards it.
Simsie this is your chance! Escape the US like honestly do you really want to stay here vs the UK???
I mean you no longer need a k1 visa Biden says let them come in 😂😂😂
WHAT !!! WWHHHAATT !!!! but yoiu still sooo little,,,,,, WHAAATTTTTTT
OMG CONGRATULATIONS FROM POLAND😻🇵🇱
Haha I am very non-romantic so I watched this out of interest in hearing about the legal process 🤣 your love is a secondary theme to the video 😜
congrats! i can literally feel your excitement through the screen lol i'm so happy for you gus ❤❤
Having a court marriage ASAP but a wedding party down the road is 1000% valid and acceptable! The marriage itself is really just legality and paperwork, marriage has ALWAYS been a form of business contract, the party is for you and your friends and family etc. 😊 there is no real reason you need to do both things at the same time!
At my interview in Montreal at the Embassy they asked me. How did you meet? On Second Life. What is Second Life? A virtual world. Where did you meet in person? Rapid City South Dakota. Did he meet your family? Yes he came to Manitoba and met my Mum and my siblings and nieces. He even met my 95 year old Grandfather. Then the lady said I can tell you are very in love with this man and since pink is the colour of love here and handed me a pink welcome to the United States paper. I cried and told her it was the best pink slip ever.
I'm getting like, teary-eyed over this. I can't believe all the paperwork and dealing with governments and lawyers y'all have to deal with to be together 😭 now THAT is a romance story I can get behind.
It's so weird to me how people  find someone at 20 and get married soon after.  I can't think of marrying at almost 30 and don't flip. :& Either way: Congrats!
Congratulations! I hope it all gets sorted so your fiance can move as soon as! I live in the UK and me and my fiance we're supposed to be coming to New Orleans last year to get married and unfortunately had to cancel it all. Cannot wait for the travel ban to be lifted!!
guys we have literally watched her grow into an adult. AND NOW SHES ENGAGED!!!! we're so happy for you!
Whaaaaat congrattt💕😆
Aw congrats!❤️
Do you live alone with your cat? I dont want to be mean.
Ask sims to sponsor your wedding! Lol! And congratulations 🎊
I'm trying to find a London bae bruh
please don't read this kayla - i'm sorry but i thought they were siblings😭😭😭
Why not move to England instead of moving to the United States ? The United States is the worst place especially Florida.
Congratulations on the engagement! ❤️
YAYY OMG CONGRATS BB
CONGRATULATIONS OMG ❤️❤️
CONGRATS KAYLA!!
Can’t believe this 14 year old is getting married
congratulations!!!!
I’m so happy for you!! That’s amazing! :))
lmao i'm 28 and my longest relationship was like 2 month. this is all so crazy to me.
❤️
Congratulations to you both!!
i’m so happy for you!! congratulations! 💖
CONGRATS OMG
This is so exciting! Congratulations!!!
Yay 🎉
it’s impossible to be engaged, kelly, you’re like 14?
And here i am 6 years into a relationship, and still waiting for my hubby to propose 🙃
Congratulations💕
I cannot believe we are the same age, but omggggg im so happy for you finallyyyyyy CONGRATSSSS WOOHOOO
Meanwhile I'm 25 almost 3 years of relationship with my boyfriend and thinking I'm too young to get married... 😂😂
Im so happy for you! Congratulations!
Congrats!!
kayla, marriage is a great thing but what you're doing is a mistake   you're marrying a man who can't financially support himself. you will be taking on the burden of making the money and paying for your home. he won't have a car when he gets here, he won't be able to get a job right away.  twitch streaming is great but you said it yourself he makes less money from it than if he got a job working for minimum wage. not to mention the complete emotional labor you will need to do as you will be dan's only support system in the country.   this is going to be a very stressful time when he gets here and i just don't think you're thinking clearly
We just got married, on April 1st.  We were going to do a courthouse wedding, when I called to find out details, they told us, "We stopped doing court weddings 3 years ago." May want to call your local courthouse and see IF they even do those anymore. It was a shock to find out they don't do that, we had to find someone to officiate our wedding and a place to do it in less than a week's time. Congrats on your engagement and we wish you and your partner the best!
Congratulations 🥳🥳🥳🥳
As a fellow immigrant, I feel your pain with Immigration. I came to the US with a J1 visa, met my husband, and we got married JUST before the visa expired. People literally said to me "oh, you're married to a citizen, so you're a citizen, right?" Mmm... NO. It's way more complicated (and so much expensive) than people think. Glad that your case is moving forward and hopefully he'll be able to come soon! :)
Omgggggg Yassss bestie
I never clicked on a video so fast in my life.
CONGRATS!
Congratulations!!
Oh my gosh congrats!!!
I feel like my friend is marrying I feel so weird and so proud!! YAY YOU GO SIMSIE
Congrats on your engagement. Years ago I worked with a lady who went through the k-1 visa process. She didn't have a pandemic to slow down the process. You both will get through this process. better and stronger. Best of luck to you both.
Dont get married while you are waiting for him to get processed. it will make your case delayed.  The biggest mistake my buddie did who moved to TX from Canada was marrying his now wife in TX.  it delayed their case two years because it sends red flags that it may be a fake marriage to just get citizenship.
My buddie who immigrated here to Canada from the UK had to have 20,000 GBP in his bank account in order to come to Canada.
That medical has to be paid out of pocket, insurance doesn't cover it.  it cost my buddie here in Canada $800 for that medical to go to the USA and he had to pay that twice with two medicals.  And us Canadians have free universal healthcare so we arent used to paying for healthcare.  Our healthcard doesn't cover medical to immigrate to a new country,
Awe I hope that everything works out and y'all can see each other soon <3
Awwww congratulations 🍾🎊🎉🎈😱💕🙌🏽
OMGGGGGG congrats!!!!!
aw congrats!!
very happy for you <3
I think its super interesting too! I loved it hahah
of course my brazil is travel banned, we have a stupid president
Wait...but you’re 12? Jkjk, CONGRATS!! I’m so happy for you 🥲😊❤️
daaaamn what ?? congrats!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Congrats 🎊
So happy for you!!!!! I hope he gets to come here soon!!!
Congratulations!!
I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE
IS SHE REALLY GETTING MARRIED??????
wait, WHAT????????
The situation here in Brazil is terrible. It feels like we are living in a horror movie. 😞
We had our interview, 4 years ago, it was super chill, the interviewer at the end said we were already accepted he just wanted to talk to us and see how we were together and that was it, I’m on the 10 year visa now it’s been the best choice I’ve ever made!
Congrats 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🤩🥰
The next exiting video will be "I'm pregnant"
i dead ass thought you were british...
am i crying? no i'm not! you are!
Awwwww 🥰🥰🥰
CONGRATULATIONS!!!! ahhh I'm so happy for you two
Omg I clicked on and the feels!  My friend tried to get a visa after already marrying an American and it took so long to get back in after he'd popped over to Canada for work.  And my close friend it took 2 years of long distance marriage to get her husband over from Tunisia to the England, can you imagine?  You really have to be in love to go through that.   Good Luck!!!!!!!! Fingers crossed it goes smoothly!
Omgggg congrats 🥳🥰❤️❤️
Europe is a country...
Fingers crossed for you! The UK are hoping we'll all be out of full lockdown by June 21st, so that could also mean travel bans are lifted after then too. We're currently on track for it... but we shall see.
I am in the middle of filing my husbands i130 petition and idk if his visa is even going to last long enough for the process. I’m so super stressed that he will get sent back his home country
One of my sisters friends is marrying someone from the USA and is going through the same shit, don’t know his name but lmao
Congratulations
Kayla, when deciding whether or not to take the plunge and do the 14 day quarantine in another country, dont wait too long. Flights are few and far between and uncertain right now and there might be complications with regards to covid test paperwork and quarantine rules during this period. It can take more than a month to get into an available flight and with covid tests you can't be sure you can get onto the flight until the day of.
congrats kayla! im so happy for you both💕💕
AHHHHH!!!
That is great kayla!! My god. Hearing this im so lucky that my bf and i both live in europe. He is italian and i am dutch. He has been working and living in holland for more than a year now. We can just move freely between countries, work and living wherever we want as long as we can pay for it. I feel so blessed. The only problem rightnow is the language. We speek english to eachother at the moment but he has to learn dutch so he can find a better job here and because he wants to stay in holland. And i want to learn italian because his family doesnt speak english. They actually speak a dialect that is very different from italian but luckaly they also speak italian. Right now priority is learning dutch because he lives here. Also something to think about is when we want to start a family we want to raise our kids in dutch and italian but that means we have to stop speeking english to eachother at some point. Which is our main language right now. Raising kids bi lingual is pretty doable for children but tri lingual is a lot.. its going to be difficult but im not to worried. If you really want it and see a future with someone you can acomplish anything. I found my moms old italian course from 15 years ago that she never did something with. So with the walkman in hand i can start to study some italian and my boyfriend has his interview to start free dutch lessons (paid by the government for people who have to or want to learn) this tuesday. If it is save with the pandemic  i will meet his family this summer. I wont be able to undertand much at this point, but its going to be fine :) he can show me where he comes from etc.
Ooooh!!!! Congrats!!!! So happy for y‘all
Omg I’m so happy for you! BTW I’m European, married to an American and I’m working on my visa as well!! I have the medicals and interview in a few weeks!! You’ll probably never see my comment but I hope it all goes smoothly and lmk if you have any questions ♥️
Congratulations 🎈🎉🎊🍾
Congratulations Kayla and Dan!
i thought she was 7 years old, what is this !!!
Yay!!! so glad to hear you finally have some movement going on!! So exciting!
They grow up so fast😨👩‍🦲
I can already see the sequels to this video.  "So...I Am Married".  "So...I Am Pregnant".
Congratulations kayla <3
I'm so happy for you guys ❤️❤️
So happy for both of you!!
Yaaay 💕💕
Yess bby
Congratulations!!!!❤
I'm an American and I've been having to deal with visas to stay in the UK with my partner during this pandemic so I completely understand your pains but from the other way around 😭 im so broke rn from visa fees and been living in limbo unable to work or travel for months, so fingers crossed everything goes smoothly for all of us!
Congratulations! I hope everything goes well and you are able to be as happy as possible!!
Congratulations lilsimsie and Duck Dan I'm so happy for you guys cant wait to  what is in store for  streams now !!!!!!
congrats Kayla! u da best
gratulálok!😀
I learned a lot today thanks
My husband and are an international couple and we went through this in 1992. It was very stressful then, I can't imagine how it is post 911. My husband is also British (now American). Good luck and remember just relax and be honest.♥️
How can Kayak, a 12 year, old be engaged? 😮
You know you could have done all this with him here. You just had to marry here first. Then you do all the “proof” as a married couple.
I'm so happy for you two for finally haveing a date or a timeline. And overall that there is forward movement with this whole process. 2k is a lot of money, but it's better than waiting for like two more years until your case gets processed. I hope everything goes smoothly and the Duck comes to the US very soon <3
So happy for you guys!
my ELEVEN YEAR OLD SELF is SCREAMING but my 18 year old self tryna keep it cool cus i am cool...    OMG KAYLakdpsdvjiwa jgfajw
pls!!!! congrats🥺
I'm so excited for you guys to know there's finally progress in the process!! ♥
Damn, i didn't know a 12 year old could get engaged?
Congrats on the engagement! It's very awful that you two had to go through during these complicated times. But yay that the status changed! Hope that everything will be smooth sailing from here on.
thank you so much for explaining the process so simply and making it easy to understand. as someone who intends to go through this process in the future it's great to see someone else who's around the same age as me going through it step by step. also, congratulations! i'm so glad things are finally moving forward and dan will be there soon!
You guys look like brother and sister.....its weird
yes! yes! just yes!
Congrats!
Congratulations 🎊❤️
Congratulations 🎈 I’m so happy for you 😭♥️
If he's not allowed to work is he still allowed to stream? It accounts for a significant portion of your qualifying income to sponsor him I'd assume, so it kinda seems like a grey area since I don't think twitch checks for work authorization before letting you get donos. Idk, just a curiosity. Good luck with the next leg of your life, happiness looks good on you 💕
HOLY CRAP!!!! IM SO HAPPY FOR U
CONGRATSS!!!
Her sims got married, and now it’s time for their God/Creator
I recommend reducing ur distance on tinder to avoid this hassle .....
Kayla as a wife...I can't wait to see this! Congratulations to you and Dan!  This is somehow so strange to me BUT NOT in a bad way, it's just a good strange ^-^ And here I am, an almost 23 y.o. girl that doesn't have any idea what she's doing with her life 😂
Very excited for you both! Marriage is stressful in general. I can’t imagine all of this on top of it all!!! What doesn’t stress you to death makes you more amazing. Keep on being your Simsie self.
I literally clicked because of the engagement but the actual video was way more interesting. Congratulations to you for getting this far in the process, I hope it all goes smoothly ❤️
CONGRATULATIONS Kayla✨❤🎆✨❤🎉
I've been watching Kayla's videos since I was in 5th grade and I'm going to high school next year this is crazy
IM CRYING
My step mum is Canadian and I live in UK, she moved here about 6 years ago. I had no idea this is the process because she was actually born in UK but then has lived in Canada ever since so she has a dual passport. So she just moved here without a visa. This process is ridiculous honestly, they make it so hard to do it legally it's no wonder so many people don't do it
That all sounds like a big pain but I’m happy you two are finally getting your way 😁
Congratulations to you both ❤️
I can really relate, I've gone through the Process 3 times,  having moved to the Netherlands from Canada to live with a girl friend.    (First time relationship didn't last).     2nd time  got married,  (and divorced 7 years later).   And Currenty  together almost 9 years with my GF.    Having major life changes in the hands of govenment officials isn't fun.        Congradulations!
omg, lizzie and joel married, lauren pregnant, gloom engaged, you engaged
Congrats!! I thought this was an April fools prank 😅
OMG! Congratulations!!!
Kayla this video is trending!
#42 ON TRENDING!!!!! I am so happy for you Kayla! Congrats!
Awwh congratulations Kayla!!❤️💍
Damn, getting the fiance visa is somewhere in my future and covid makes it seem so scary and tideous.
My husband and I finalised this process here in Norway RIGHT before the pandemic came to Norway, and it was SO stressful. I was in visa limbo for close to two years before we were able to get married.
I still perceive this girl as a 15 year old i cant believe she’s getting married-
When I clicked on this video I thought it would be an engagement announcement, and then she started talking about the VISA process. P.S. congratulations! 💍
I really hate people who are like " pictures? proof? I need to see" Im like " Mind your own godda*n buisness you nosey MF".. Tell them to take a hike simsie, you know the truth. You dont have to prove you relationship to anyone. :). Maybe thats just a UK attitude from me.      On a lighter note, I loooove that sweater  :)
OMG CONGRATULATIONS U BOTH❤️❤️❤️
I was like "why is YouTube recommending me a 90 day fiance video" and then I saw who posted it. Congrats! I got engaged in January this year after 5 years together, this pandemic really makes life away from your partner that much harder.
OMG CONGRATS DUDEEEEE
So what I’m hearing is Kayla is adopting a sugar baby from Europe...got it...  Jk, I am so happy for them!!! You can really see how happy she is about this and finally being able to live together, it gives me hope for my future and all that lame shit 🥺❤️  Girl you are literally glowing with happiness. You deserve it more than anyone. Imagine if you knew when you were younger how much all your hard work would pay off.
Congrats !!!!!!
Congratulations!!!!!  My New Zealand fiancee and I decided to do it the other way, I moved from the USA to New Zealand to be with him. We were too intimidated by the USA process haha.  Still need to do it though so we can move to the States eventually.  So happy for you!!
I am getting married in October. Me and my fiance have been together for 7 years and I cannot wait!
Omggg!!!!! Congratulations 👏🎉🎉🎉🎉👏🎉👏🎉👏
Can't believe we will get to hear her saying "my husband" someday after this, when she starts off being our wee lil baby ;///;
Congrats. I hope you will 'soon' live together with Cats (and maybe dogs).  We just have to overcome the New World Order! :-)
Awwww!!!😍 congratulations !🎉 ❤️
I went through this process in the late 90s. He was from Canada, but it was the same rigmarole then as well. Good luck and congratulations!!!
Kayla do the engagement photos with your sim self and his sim self and go all out with screenshot like you usually do. post them like it's normal don't acknowledge they're not real people.
You are literally speedrunning lifw
WAIT YALL ENGAGED NOW!! YAYAYAYAY
omg congrats girl <3
Yessss
Awh congratulations!!!
people r stupid if they think u can up n move to another country like nothing
aaaaaaaah yay! I’m so excited for you! I can’t wait to hear more updates when he finally gets to come (if you so choose to share of course)! Much much love to you, I can’t even imagine how difficult this has been ❤️
SOOOOO excited and happy for you lovely people 🤍🤍🤍 I can’t imagine how happy you two must be and I’m so grateful that you two overcame this challenging past year’s trials. I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN HAPPIER TO OPEN YOUTUBE TODAY AND SEE THIS!
Hopefully they change the rules so that if there's a travel ban, people who've had two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine are exempt. Good luck!
Well don't sit on waiting out on easing up on the travel ban, just do the 14-day quarantine for him in Mexico, and... It's Mexico, cheap in general, but all the luck to you two!
OMG YESS THATS AWESOME EEEE
Congrats!!!!!!💜💜💜💜
he gave up free healthcare? yep hes a keeper! loool..im so happy for you kayak lol<3
I was curious about how older Kayla and Dan are as I knew me and my boyfriends are similar ages to them... nevermind! Dan is 51 according to google
Congratulations! I’m from Spain and my husband is from the US (from Virginia, to be exact). We went through all that stuff too. You guys are going to be fine.   When you first get the green card, they give you a provisional one that lasts two years, then, you have to renew it into the permanent one that has to be renewed every 10 years. We are in the process of getting the permanent green card (they basically want to know if you’re still a happy married couple).  You guys seem to have everything in order, I wish you all the best in your process. I’m very happy for you ☺️❤️.
✨CONGRATULATIONS✨❤❤
ahhhhhhhh congratsss hehngjktgksgjrljgkjlw
OMG CONGRATS KAYLA!!!!
congratulations!!
I'm so happy for you!
Anyone else notice the audio isn't synced or is it just me?
So happy for you Kay! 💙
The Orlando courthouse has the cutest room they do weddings in!!!! Congrats!!! 🍾🎉
Congrats!!! I looked into my husband (Canadian) moving to the US but that's a crazy amount of time and money and he would have missed so much of our daughter's life. So we looked at finding out what would happen if I moved to Canada. Turns out spousal sponsorship is ten times easier and cheaper than the US....so many applications. I had one application for mine and we could live together as a family while we waited. It took a year for me to get my permanent residency even during covid. Honestly importing my car was a more pita than getting my PR status.
I cannot IMAGINE how stressful and complicated this must have been for you, I am so glad that you guys are finally getting somewhere and that you'll be able to be together again in a few months. Congratulations!!
This is amazing!!! Congrats 🎉  on your big win!!! You deserve it!!!
I'm so excited for you!!
I was in the twitch stream when you were talking about this and I was so clueless that you needed to have a whole interview and stuff to move to the US until then! Congrats!!
YASSSSSSSS
Congratulations 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Congrats!!!
CONGRATULATIONSSS 💚💚💚
Congratulations! So glad that you can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel for this whole process!
I feel you... I'm in Canada on a work visa that expires in July and my Permanent Resident application is delayed because of the pandemic, it's so nerve-wracking to be in the limbo hoping the papers are done in time and nothing gets denied :(
I don't get why Americans don't go to their spouses countries.  Why do they always come here?
AH congrats!!!!!!!!!!!!
uhhh I’m so happy for you two! My god, love that for you!!! ❤️
I never comment but congratulations!
The whole process is just ridiculous. I’m so sorry you’ve had to go through all of this. It’ll be SO incredibly worth it though. I’m so excited for you guys! 🥰
I didn't know 12 year olds could get engaged.  But seriously, congratulations!
Congrats!!
congrats!! I can't believe you haven't seen him in so long. I couldn't imagine not seeing my partner for that long. Truly telling of how strong your relationship already is! congrats again!!!
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I thought you BEEN engaged
I’m so excited for you!!! Congrats love!
"OMG engaged" totally me. Congrats! I do not know you and Dan are engaged till now.
This is wild.  I always forget you’re an adult.  I used to look up to you so much
Wedding recreation in Sims when
June 29th is my brothers birthday!!!
Sims and 90 Day Fiance crossover event
You should have titled this "MY FIANCE & I SUE THE GOVERNMENT AND EXPOSE 90 DAY FIANCE (NOT CLICKBAIT) (EMOTIONAL)"
Congrats!!!
Congratulations!!! I cannot believe its all that work... I am American and moved to Canada 20 years ago..... You can come as a visitor for so long then you have to get engaged and married... which I did  the costs were ridiculous!!! and so many steps to get my Permanent Resident Card.... and My husband had to prove his income to support me which he made a lot of money so we were good..... He is deceased now for 4 years .... We had to go back and forth to the US Embassy in Toronto.... every step cost us lots of money ended up thousands of dollars I wish you luck with your process
Congrats!!!
Congratulations 🥳 I was wondering if you would have considered marriage so young if it wasn't necessary to live together, or have you always wanted to get married young, or did it just feel right? Genuinely curious, no judgement! I'm glad you finally have things sorted, I hope it all goes as smoothly as possible! (I understand if this is too personal - the immigration stuff was really interesting though if awful-sounding! I dream of a world without borders ✌️)
Whaaaat isn’t she like 14?
So excited for you, Kayla! So funny I’ve been watching a LOT of 90 day fiancé and this was the first video on my homepage I had to laugh lol. Congratulations!!!
What will happen to Dan's twitch when he moves?
You guys are so cute together
Congrats ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oooo I’m happy for you girl
yayyy!!! congrats❤️❤️❤️
But dude.. the whole process of trying to move to the US is ridiculous. Like what
When she said “Milligan” I was like what 👀👀 Lmao I don’t hear my last name ever used by other people because it’s so uncommon I feel
Congrats and best of luck.
you guys should go to Cancun or something for the 24 day quarantine as like a pre honey moon thing!
in the game or in real life?
Wait you guys the joke about no holding hands until marriage isn't gonna work because she's actually going to be married! Congratulations!!!
This was a really interesting and informative video! Your knowledge on the subject comes through for sure!
omg congrats ❤️🥳🎉
congratulations!! that's great news and i hope you guys are very happy :)!!
important question are you gonna change your last name so it’s not sims anymore
CONGRATULATIONS 🎉💐🎉💐
Simsie brain: sims and immigration stuff
Aw this made me so happy!
anyone else notice how she's positively glowing in this video?
i accidentally skipped another video for this so it was a SHOCK not seeing the title. congrats!!
Congrats! That's great news. My son has a gf that is in japan. They have plans to marry also. They haven't started the process yet cause of covid. They have been talking/video chatting for 2 years now..she has come here for a few weeks before covid. Love her dearly. I can't wait til this is all over and she can finally move here and get married!
I work with uscis and my friends never understand what I’m talking about when I try to explain 😆 u did a great job explaining the I129F K1 visa stuff! Congrats ❤️❤️
So happy for y’all!!!
Congratulations Kayla! So happy for you - I don't watch you on twitch but I do watch back your old streams and I know it's been a lot on you! Hopefully Dan can just quarantine here by the time everything is approved. Best of luck and wishes for you two!
He should take a 15 day vacation in Cancun, Mexico, in some resort and then go to the us lol (you could also go there and stay with him lol)
Wait when did they get engaged? I- I missed a lot
Congrats! That's so exciting! I feel your pain, I have a friend who is currently in the uk she now lives there, but she still has a visa to come here because her parents live here, and she has not been able to see them since covid started.
I am not going through the visa thing, but I did recently get engaged, so I'm having to navigate all the "WHEN PHOTOS?? WHEN WEDDING???" type questions. I can definitely relate to you there. I hope all goes well! <3
june 29th is my birthday 💞
Congrats! but now we're gonna need a Kayla and Dan channel...
I thought you were like 15
This makes me so happy for you, I wish you both so much happiness
Lifting prayers things go smoothly! I have had several friends who have gone through this and it is a lengthy process, but it's eventually worked out for them so I'm confident it will work out for you as well! Best wishes!!!
You're engaged to your Dan and I got dumped by mine the day you announce it, oh the irony.  Anyway, congrats!
Omg please go on 90 day fiancé! This is the crossover I need!!
I ADORE the description
it's funny that even if she didn't post it on april fool's but I still thought it was a prank
That’s awesome so happy for you guys I know it’s been hard to get good news. I feel your frustration and loneliness my husband is in the military and deploys a lot so I get it when you say it’s hard to be away from your partner my husband is my penguin they mate for love been together since high school almost 17 wonderful years
Congrats to you two :)
I’m so excited for you! And honestly I loved this break from Sims content with a bit more slice of life info. I’m just not much of a Twitch person, but love your YouTube channel, so thank you for sharing here!
After watching this saga on twitch for months, I may have cried a little watching this. So happy for you guys!
congrats you guys!!!! my fiance and i have been together for 6 years. we lived together in canada for a whole year but i had to go back bc of covid. we were going to start my paperwork to get a canadian visa but its been a lot of hard work. if you have any help or advice for me, i'd really appreciate it!
congratulations!!! im so happy for you
Oh my godddd *crying* I'm so happy for you guys!
I’m very happy for you Kayak.
YAY!! Congrats lilsimsie!
So... my bf and his family immigrated here from Mexico legally. Had their aunt sponsor them. It's been 17 years and none of them have citizenship status. Under Biden hopefully, he is making the process easier. My bf makes good money too, and is the Samsung rep of Utah, with 2 of the Samsung executives personally reaching out to him. He is so close to getting his citizenship. before his parents too, and when he does, he can sponsor them, cause more sponsors is a faster time. Their Visa ran out for his parents after 6 months, and they got it renewed, but technically his parents are illegal. He and his siblings aren't though. Because of that, his dad had to work under the table jobs panting cars without a respirator and got thyroid cancer, and they have no insurance cause his parents are illegal, but they get a letter every year from the government saying to hang on, your so close, so they stay. They now want to go back to Mexico and retire, going through 17 years of lawyer fees, etc for nothing... Alexis wants his citizenship before he gets married.. We think he'll get it in 2 or 3 years hopefully, maybe faster under Biden now too. He is on a work Visa, thank god cause when before, he also had to work under the table jobs since their Visa ran out within a few months The kids get faster visas and everything before his parents. So he can work normal jobs and can have insurance, whereas his parents can't. I've learned a ton about the immigration system through dating him.
Congratulations!!!!
Many, many congratulations, Kayla. Wonderful news xxx
Congratulations you two! So nice to see you finally got your interview date 🥳
Move to England.
how old is she ? (asking becouse ı really dont know)
I’m from England, we have vaccinated loads and they are planning for all restrictions to be lifted in June. You should be good. :)
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU BOTH!!!!!!!!
Congratulations Kayla!
AHHH so happy for you
Yay! I’m so happy for you two!
OMG CONGRATS!!!
aaaawwweee his interview is on my wedding anniversary <3 <3 <3
I had to go through the whole immigration with my Canadian husband.  It was a nightmare I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy and I don't understand how anyone would go through that for money.  You couldn't pay me enough to go through anything like that again.  Good luck to you and congratz!!
Congratulations
Great news. You can get started on your real life 100 baby challenge 😉
Congratulations Kayla. Best wishes to you and Dan x
I love that you're just going to get married as soon as you can after he arrives. There's no reason to spend a ton of money on a wedding when a family reunion, after all the global pepperoni nonsense is over, costs much less!!
what country is her bf from? Canada? (haven’t watched vid yet) OH WAIT FIANCÉ NOW AWH, wait nvm england, samezzzz, also kayla just called Europe a country, thought you were better than this haha!!
bestie what. I MISSED A FEW EPISOFES HERE.
oh my gosh the interview is the day after my birthday and that is so exciting. I'm praying for y'all and sending lots of love. I hope the best 💞
I am so excited for you!
Love the thumbnail
what are those eyebrows hahaha
WAIT!!!  cowplants at the wedding? that needs to happen.
so happy for you simsie! 🥺✨ you deserve all the love and happiness
When your happy Kayla is engaged but feel weird because YOUR NOT ENGAGED😭😭😭
Congrats!
My wife and I had flashbacks to our US > UK visa process when we watched this. xD Lots of luck to you guys!!
Man I really hope you do wedding blogs. Like seriously sweetie we watched you plan wedding on screen so many damn times 😂🤣😂
I'm in a similar situation with my partner who I am eventually going to move to the US for, so it's nice to hear somebody else talking about the experience of not being able to see each other, and also to see that things are moving and how the whole process works. congratulations Kayla and Dan!!!
6,000th comment here, you'll never see me again, ok bye.
You can up and move if you made from South America
Congratulations!
My (now) Husband and I were part of the first round of the K-1 visa lawsuit. So thankful! We were able to get married March 1st because of it! My husband did have to quarantine for 2 weeks in Mexico, but he was able to come in January 20th. We had been long distance for 8 YEARS and now we're MARRIED! Congratulations, Kayla! You finally have a timeline!
I have seen videos of you when he lived in the US where you baked a cake and he ate it - so you have proof he and you were together - on the internet.
why did i start crying
congratulations <3 and I know the feeling of getting obsessed with things like this xD
My boyfriend/fiancé of almost 9 years lives in another state and we are trying to get him to my state. The biggest issue has been financial; I was going to move him over when I had my first apartment, but covid happened, I lost my job and eventually the apartment. I just got a job and while I'm not confident that I'll be able to properly afford it, I'm going to look at an apartment next week. Nearly a decade (we were teens when we met) of not living with someone you desperately want to spend your life with kind of makes any dumb mistakes I might make worth it to get him here. (And if we both work, we'll be able to comfortably afford the apartment.)  I couldn't image being separated by an entire ocean and thousands of miles. I wish the very best for you!
Once your fiancé is in the US, things should be much faster. There have been much less people adjusting for status, requesting green cards, so processing times within the US got much faster.  I came to the US a few years ago and recently got my 10 year green card. I was expecting it in maybe another 6 to 9 months . So you might be lucky to get the work permit much faster. Btw get all the documents for aos ready now to send it right after getting married. And add the work and travel permit. There is no charge for it as long as you submit it with the aos paperwork. Congratulations to the two of you!
Congratulations! <3 Interesting to hear about the process too, I hope everything goes well!
I'm so happy I almost cried. Congrats!
So happy for you Kayla!! ❤️
Congrats!
Congratulations!!
Congrats!!! I hope all goes well :)
if he has to quarantine in another country you can both make a vacation out of it
Congratulations ❤️❤️❤️
Haha the visa interview is literally the easiest part of the whole damn process. Me and my hubs showed up with a bunch of paperwork ready for an intense interview and then they literally just asked for our names, how long have we been together, and when we got married. We offered to show them all the papers we had and they were like "No no please dont" xD
This is so crazy! I would never imagine how complicated getting married across countries can be. You're very strong for going through this. I hope everything goes well from now on!! Best of luck
I had no idea that it was such an involved process! That really is fascinating. I can't imagine how difficult that has been for the two of you, but I'm so happy for you that things are moving along finally. I hope everything goes well in the interview!
One day see will have kids and forget about us 😭😭so hopefully one day she will notice me😭🥺💕I love u bby💕😩
I love this! I'm happy for you guys. The visa process really does take so long! I went through the visa process with my own husband and let me twll you guys, the paperwork is no joke. Neither are tje processing times. They have like 3 entities look over the same packet of info for fun. A year wasn't bad. Me and my hubby waited a bit more than 2 years for his permanent status visa approves. We didn't have to do k1 visa because i lived in Peru with him and married him in Peru so we did the permament resident visa upfront.
bruh i see this and i'm like .......  oml CONGRATS
Congrats Kayla! I’m happy for you and Dan! 💕🎉
I find this a little weird, a very good friend of mine has a girlfriend from the USA (we're from Belgium) and she has come to visit twice for months since the start of corona. How come you guys haven't been able to see each other in a year?
I just got the notification today 😩
Congrats! As someone who is getting married in a courthouse without family soon, I definitely understand where you're coming from. I'm so happy for you!
This makes me cry, I’m applying for a visa and its sooooo hard! Such a long process, my husband and I have been married for 3 years now with a 21 month old. Hopefully soon i can get my appointment ❤️ the thing is I am already in the US illegally so I have to go back to my country, if I get denied I can’t come back to my husband and baby 😞 its scary
congrattttttssssssssssss!!!
I also met my husband through the internet and we dated for 4 years and visited 4-6 times a year (he is from Oregon and I am from central Canada). We had plans to marry in September 2020 but then the pandemic hit and we had to cancel our wedding and were separated for nearly a year (we last saw each other January 2020) but we decided that my parents and I would travel to the USA and get married in December 2020. He immediately moved right after and we are in the process of him becoming a Canadian citizen but holy shit it's been hard and yeah... there are SOOOOO many papers and it costs so much and this has been super stressful but I am so glad he is finally here and we can start our life together. We have every intention of having a bigger and proper wedding with proper engagement photos and I'm so excited but he is my husband now and it still feels like a dream!! I am so so so happy for you Kayla!!!! It will feel wonderful when he is finally there!!!❤❤❤❤
uugh. i know this all too well. my bf moved here before C-19. but it was similar for him to live here with me, it took them 15months. hate it...
Damn x I'd be on the website too x like just waiting, god that would suck, also the uk is super nice x so hopefully you and Dan can move here in a few years x
I lost my mind! This is so crazy seeing the growth of a person through their channels! I’m so happy for her and proud
That is so exciting!! Congrats to both of you, and I hope it continues to work out!
Congratulations also the new maps on fall guys are hard love you
congratulations! I hope you are both very happy together!
Yaaas
I'm so happy for you guys, really! I felt your sadness and “tiredness” talking about this because all of this bureaucracy just sucks. If you've waited this long it just shows that you're meant to be and that's really sweet. I'm so sorry you have to go through all of this stuff also. Just be patient! know that we're always here for you and we'll support you in every decision you two make. Can't wait to see you as a bride and soon creating a family. I feel like a mom and my daughter just grew up and started to do adults stuff even though you're so much older than me lmao. Anyway, I'm so happy for you, Kayla! Congrats ❤️
Turkeys cheap from the UK, anyways good luck 🤞 ❤️
Kayla: I'd love to live England.  English people: why would u live here you've got hot weather we have rainy weather.  everybody else: i like living here, right in the middle not to cold, not to hot
Congratulations! Im so happy for you :)
Sorry the UK sucks, ik ik I don’t like being here either sometimes 😂
Giiirl I'm so glad you guys have dates!! My boyfriend lives in Texas and I'm in Canada, haven't been able to see each other. I understand how hard it is!
This was honestly interesting to watch. I'm in a long-distance relationship, but I'm in the UK and he's in the US. The whole visa process does seem really scary and stressful >.<
Congratulations on your engagement 😁 The pandemic really has effected it all so much, I really hope that things get back on track soon. We are slowly coming out of lockdown in the UK. Good luck to you both 💖
I'm so happy for you!! The pure joy on your face is beautiful. Xx
I'm so happy for you!! :D
congrats! im sorry you have to jump through so many hoops but I'm glad its finally moving along for you :)
Congrats Kayla and Dan! Looks like my Birthday wish came true for you both - you're welcome! :)
Congratulations!! You seem like such a lovely person and glad you have found your person!
so... when's your featured episode gonna air? 😍😍
NO FRIGGIN WAY KAYLA, U U WHERE JUS IN HIGHSCHOOL TALKING ABOT HAMLET AND HISTORY WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN-
idk what year you were born but make sure you have the newer version birth certificate. even though we paid thousands of dollars for lawyers they missed that part and instead of approving us at the interview they did not because of the old birth certificate. It set us back 6 months and the lawyers would not move forward unless we paid $500 even though it was their mistake.
this is so crazy to me, like i’ve been watching your videos since you were a junior in high school and i was a freshman, and it’s just crazy to think about your videos where you would talk about some mean kid names susan who was in your classes, and now you’re literally getting married im like at a loss for words
Dress idea: base game sims wedding dress
I was trying not to scream during this video.
I'm so happy for you both!!!
I'm lucky my fiancé is already is in the US on a H1B visa, but man, still the issue of visa status and every 3 years right now (because we aren't getting married right away) it really sucks because he has to travel out of the country to a US embassy and apply for a continuation and aoijfaowejfaoijw it's so annoying
Congrats
It's so cool to see your videos trending on YouTube 🌟
I am the same I am in the uk and waiting for it to be lifted but instead I am going to Colombia 🇨🇴
so how will it work with him being able to work when he moves to the US? Like his twitch etc...?
such a romantic process to get married. congrats though!
dan can come quarantine in canada
Congratulations 😊
I didn't even know you were engaged lol but I am so proud and happy for you Kayla!
Im so happy for you? Also very jealous
How is Kayak a 14 year old getting married?HOW seriously though congratulations 🙂🙂
I'm so excited for you!!!!
Congratulations! The proces sounds like a nightmare though... good that it´s nearly done :)
This is such good news! I suspect you're over the moon excited. I'm excited for you!!!
He should just move here illegally its britian like come on
AHHH CONGRATS!!!
first thought: omg dan is finally getting his visa im so happy!! second thought: omg simsie can finally decorate his ac island im so happy!! congrats you guys!! :)
CONGRATS :D
wait isn't lilsimsie like 12 that's kinda young to be getting married jk its for the meme sorry Kayla
I never comment on YouTube but I've been following you for a while and am so happy for you Kayla! I too immigrated from Europe but to Canada to be with my now spouse. Really stressful indeed, can't imagine doing this during a pandemic. You are very strong
Woah this is trending number 33 rn that's crazy
It cost the same or more to apply for the fiance or spouse visa here in the UK, it's crazy. But good luck to you guys, and I hope you can be together soon.
I applied for K1 back in December... Still no news. I'm glad your case is moving forward
I guess I need a british boyfriend too, that's my que. Not me still having hope of actually finding someone interesting...
I’m sooooo happy for you and Dan!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
OH MY GOD
So happy for you!!!! Hope the journey from this point forward is easy and quick! Sending you love and light 💖
congrats to the engagement!!! you are so cute together <3 i just have to ask how old are you ? and what star sign are you??
I’m crying!!!  I’m so happy for you congratulations!!!
I vote that her fiance has to complete a very difficult and/or annoying sims challenge to win her hand in marriage
I know this process sucks and I don’t think It should take as long as it does but I’m definitely happy that the NBC takes it so seriously to the point where people who really don’t love each other don’t put in all that effort. In Kayla’s case her and Dan actually love each other and it’s great that they get to prove that. I feel like this is such a good process in the way that they get interviewed so people who just want to move to the US for certain benefits can’t do that just by marrying somebody and then divorcing them a year later.
Congrats!
Congrats!! I hope it all goes smoothly and in your favor!!
Man I started watching when she was like a teenager complaining about homework and here she is engaged 😄😄
omg 14 year old kelly is engaged !!
Not kayla being only a few years older than me and already engaged, what am I doing with my life
I’m so happy for you guys!!!!
Congratulations!🥳
Well done...your patience is remarkable! Congratulations and good luck to Dan and yourself.
The U.S. embassy in Canada isn't even processing citizenship renunciations. If they can successfully sue over not allowing people in, I bet they could successfully sue for not allowing people out.
Wait wait wait no naaah no nope. Dude I'm jealous, you are an year older than me and I looked up to you because you are a normal 20 year old, man am I jealous. Congratulations! I am so happy for you!
congrats only thing I would say is don't make jokes with them because they refused my friend before because she made a joke about ditching her hubby to find a millionaire lol
So happy for you. I have always  dreamed of marrying someone from the UK myself. So happy for you 2.  I'm sure you 2 will be very happy together ❤😊
Omg 😭 I’m so happy for you! I remember when you were graduating high school haha. I ABSOLUTELY know your pain too!! Finally, after dating for ten years, my fiancé and I applied for the K1 visa in February 2020 as well.... and then the pandemic hit. I’ve literally been keeping count of the weeks. Our case has been sitting and waiting to go to the embassy since July of last year, and some people have already gotten their interview dates for Canada for cases issued around our time... but nothing yet for us. Fingers crossed we get good news too!
She’s growing up so fast 🥺
12 year old kayak is engaged????
Congratulations! I’m so happy for you. And jealous. Hope you get to be together soon! :)
Congratulations!! 😊😊🎉🎉
CONGRAAATSSS !!
My husband just had his AOS interview yesterday! Be prepared to wait a long time for that too but you’ll have your partner with you!
I wonder if it's this complicated so people don't do it
Congrats ❤️🥰🥰
I’m so excited for you!! It is cool to hear about the actual visa process as a 90 day fiancé fan and a lilsimsie fan ❤️
Oh i would love to see your engagement photos and wedding in the sims. That would be just awesome
OMG SIMSIE IS GETTING MARRIED!! It feels like yesterday when you were still filming in your dorm and speed build sunday. 😂 I am so happy for you and dan 🥰🥺
I’m invested and excited lol
When I saw the title I thought it was the legacy challenge... Then I saw the photo hahaha  Congrats❤ Wish it goes well
Congratulations Kayla and Dan! So happy for you both ❤❤
CONGRATULATIONS LILSIMSIE!!!!😁😁😁
Omg!!!! Congrats!!!!!!!!
Congratulations
Congratulations, Simsie! I’m glad things are finally moving forward! I can’t imagine just how much all this waiting has sucked!
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Congratulations Kayla! I am so so happy for you! You and Dan deserve this! 💗
It's crazy that you have to have so much income to be able to marry someone from another country. Like I literally wouldn't have been able to marry my husband
omg!! this is so amazing! 🥺💖
Turkey is in Europe though..? 11.00
I'm so happy for you guys! From your twitch streams I know you guys have been waiting forever and I'm so happy that it finally happened! Congratulations!
Congratulations
Congratulations! It is such a long, involved process. I'm sending a ton of good vibes your way that the travel bans lift in time for a successful move.
'Not all countries are banned, just Europe, China...' > Europe is not a country
Congrats! I just went through the same process, but I was the one immigrating. My husband and I were in a long distance relationship for 5 years before we applied for the K1-visa. The process is long and stressful. I got my interview date 9 months after we applied in 2018. I came over to the US in August 2019 and got married within a week. Then the temporary green card process.... took around year, but I am a permanent resident now. Now all that's left is the removal of conditions, for the 10 year green card and then after that I can apply for citizenship. The US immigration process is hard and time consuming., but we are happy to finally be together and would do it all over again.
Congratulations!!!! Love you Kayla 💕
Hey, so not exactly the same process, but my husband I got married in the UK and then he emigrated to Canada with me when I was expecting our first son. And you are right. Its such a long, expensive and draining process. I also sponsored him as I am Canadian by birth and being part of the British commonwealth you would think that it would be an easier process than the nightmare we went through.
yay!! so happy for you guys :D
Omg my birthday wish is that the interview is gonna go well (my birthday is June 29)😊 so so happy for you❤️
YESSS! I can’t wait to see you two together! ❤️❤️❤️
OMG IM NOT BEING DRAMATIC RN I AM LITERALLY SHOCKED 😲 CONGRATS BOTH OF YOUUUUU I FEEL SO HAPPY FOR THEM🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Congratulations on your engagement, domek on I'II be sorry od you Vive ul the channel because od your pregnancy😭😭😭
Congratulations 🎉
SO EXCITING!! CONGRATULATIONS!!🎊🍾❤️🎉🤩
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
OMG congratulations 🥳
Omg congrats!!!!!
I feel you on some level, my boyfriend is Norwegian and he can’t travel here and I there... I want to see him so bad
I like how you said "we’ll probably get married the day after". I like how you think!!! 1. Make sure the next step of applications gets started the earliest possible (i.e: get a court wedding to have the papers to get his green card) 2. Get the engagement photos 3. Wait out COVID 4. Get married like you originally thought with all the families there! Yaaay!
Wishing you nothing but complete joy, congratulations to the both of you. Also speedy results so both of you can be together
Kayla, Europe is not a country, you should have said places. You know this info
Wow you guys look at lot alike, like siblings
Congratulations Kayla!! I'm so happy for you!! ❤
i am so extremly happy for you guys. Really, i am in tears! I have been a rather silent viewer for a couple of years now and since the pandemic hit i always wondered "how are lil simsie and her boyfriend doing?". I live in a long distance relationship myself but luckily in the same country. It´s been hard for me as well but how much harder and draining must it be for both of you? To hear that Dan will get his visa soon and that there is a high possibility that he can move to the US this year just made my day. Even if the travel ban remains, there will still be a way for him to travel to the US. I wish you guys the best of luck and hopefully the remaining time of waiting is made easier for you because of that hope.
It sucks living alone. Period.
<333333333
This is the first time I’m hearing this and I’m going out of my mind with giddy. I hope the best with the interview and moving
I'M SO EXICTED FOR YOU BOTH!!!
Congrats, so happy for you both :) ❤️
Congratulations!  🥳
Are teenagers allowed to get engaged?
YAY! you sued the government, I'm so happy for you two! I can't wait for you two to be together soon!
Yessssssssss I’m so happy for youuuuu
CONGRATULATIONS!!! ✨✨✨
Congratulations I’m so happy that y’all finally have a date
Congratulations Kayla!! (Send that to tiktok as proof you arent 12 😂) My two loves collide. The sims and the train wreck that is 90 day fiancé! 😂🤣  Best wishing to you and your future hubby!! 💖
I'm so happy that things are going forward and that soon you can begin your life together :)
Congratulations!!! ❤️❤️❤️
aaaaaaaa i’m so happy for you☺️
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I have never smashed the Like button harder. Congrats!!
Ahhh! Congratulations! <3
Yay!!!! So excited for you Kayla!!!
Kayla with a 16 min vid about her relationship: "I'll get my engagement photos someday, mark my words!" Me, an awkward photographer: KAYLA ILL TAKE YOUR ENGAGEMENT PHOTOS!  In all seriousness though, congratulations on your engagement! You and Dan are a great couple and I know you'll be really happy together. ♥️ Marriage is the literal best.
Congratulations!! 🎊🎉
dude im debating on whether k1 visa or CR1! great video
OMG congrats!!😍😍
My brother and his wife are supposed to be moving to New York in May from the UK since she got a job there, fingers crossed for everyone trying to move to the US right now
Congrats to both of you. I know you have talked about this for over a year now. I am not going through this but my youngest daughter just got engaged this past weekend. We are over the moon excited and started looking at venues to have her Wedding. I can't wait to here you talk about Plans for an actual Wedding even though you will be already married.
NOWAYYYYY AAAAAA IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
Omg I saw the notification and literally screamed, but of course it’s 19 hours late!!!!!! 😢
Congratulations! So glad that the process is moving along. Hopefully the rest of it goes smoothly.  And on a side note, nothing wrong with courthouse weddings. I don't know why they get such a stigma. After being in/going to a number of friends' weddings I decided the hoopla just wasn't for me. My husband and I were together as a couple for 20 years (met during college) before we decided to finally get married (on our 20th anniversary date to boot).
Congrats!!!!
Congrats on this :D
this is such great news, so happy for you!!!
Congrats on the date, I was so excited when you said it in stream! My husband's named Dan, we have done long distance (mostly through college) for many years, we are going on ten years married this year. I hope 2021 is much brighter for you two, with wedding bells soon!
Sounds like you guys should go on vacation together and 'quaretine' ❤
CONGRATS LILSIMSIE!!! <3
When you said “fiancé visa” the other day on twitch I got chills. Congratulations!! 💜
Congratulations!!!
Wow, look at all the comments. But I just have to say...congratulations! 🤵👰🍾🎉 When I first subscribed, around the noodle time," you were in high school.  You graduated, went to uni, graduated, and now you are an adult.  Well, I said you were an adult when you got your own place and had your family over for the holidays.  But you're really there now. 😊 You've battled through all the challenges so far.  They aren't at all fun, but they have made you into a person of whom you can be proud.  This time of waiting has developed your knowledge and patience.  When you start your own family, that will truly help. You've got this!
She looks so excited talking abt it omg I’m so happy for her
Congrats!!! This was such good news to hear this morning ❤️ wishing you all the best!
Congrats111
i liked it it was nice to hear about it and l could feel your excitement :D congrats :D
What an insane process! Glad it’s moving forward again! And congrats!! It’s kinda freaky becoming engaged at a young age, but exciting still! I was engaged at 19 and married at 20
Just don’t forget to enjoy your engagement! Wedding planning can be stressful (I’m planning mine right now) but enjoy your engagement! I’m so happy for you two!
Oh my goodness!!! Congratulations Kayla!!!!!!
what eyes and skin do you use in your sims 4? Where can you download them and what are their names?
Thank you so much for making a video explaining the process. It's very helpful. And congratulations to the both of you!
So excited for you guys! I hope the rest of the process goes as smoothly as it can!
i am so happy for you two♥️
Congrats Kayla!!!! I will be rooting for you on June 29th!
Not sure about UK laws but in the US, instead of a a ”sponsor” you can have 25k per person in your household in a bank account for 5 years and then you don’t need a sponsor. Maybe UK has some law like this as well. That might solve your sponsor issue to get a UK visa/passport to live there.
I am so happy for you! I can't imagine how hard this has been and am so proud that you've stuck it out. 🧡
I knew nothing about this before, and now I feel like I understand, so I think you explained it well. Congratulations on the engagement!
OMG!!!! I am so so happy for you an I hope the things are going to be faster an Dan can come sooner!!!
I hope it all works out for you
Omg!!! Congrats!! I'm so happy for you two!!
I'm in a long distance relationship myself and my boyfriend was able to move to my country last summer, among a lot of uncertainty and stress (still LDR atm as I live in another country atm). I'm so happy it's working for you❤️
me, a twitch viewer: oh wow!! that’s so surprising i’m so excited wow i can’t believe it omg!!🤭🎉✨💕
Whew that sound like a complicated and expensive process . So happy for your both, even if he do have to quarantine in another country first, it’ll be worth it .
Thank you so much for shining a light on visa things. I am an international student in the US and the visa process is always a pain. Hope you all get to see each other soon :( and congratulations on your engagement💗
I'm so happy for you, you mentioned that you'd like to live in the UK do you think you'll move there after you get married. Congrats!!!
Very happy for her but also.. she's only 9 months older than me and.. she's engaged?? she's getting married?? 😳
Congrats!!!
CONGRATS
OH MY GOD CONGRATS!!!
Congratulations!!!
Oof I felt this- my girlfriend and I haven't seen each other much this year either because of covid.
Im happy you got a date Kayla, congratz! :)
AHHHHH I’m so excited for you!!!
wait I thought you're still a teenager-
Hello, I am so happy to hear that you finally got the visa appointment. I hope his visa gets approved ^_^ Thank you for explaining the process. My country is not on the banned list but the US embassy here is closed and they only process spouse visas. Me and my fiancé plan to get married once the Travel Bans lift and he can come here.
ooof visa applications are tough! I've only had to get a J1 Visa to come to work at camp before and I thought that was bad enough, best of luck with everything in your future <3
Me and my fiancé hope to do the same thing once this pandemic is over and I’ve been so nervous to start looking into the process and cost to do it all so it’s super awesome to here somebody else talk about it. I’d be really interested to learn more about the process and all the information you need.
This girl is engaged and I still never had relationship 🙃
Day 45 of suggesting Kayla to do "every room is a different challenge" challenge
I'm so happy for you 😁
Yayyy Kayla, so excited for you two, hopefully everything goes well and works out and that he’ll be here soon
Awesome 😎. I hope he gets his visa for y'all to be able to marry. You seen so happy about it and him.
OMG Kayla I'm so happy for Dan and you! I may have been very stressful and complicated..Congratulations ❤️❤️
I'm truly so happy for you. I'm an occasional lurker on your twitch streams so I had a little knowledge that this was going down, when I saw the title of this video I just knew you had finally heard good news! I can only imagine how freeing it feels to be on the way out of the terrible limbo you've been in - congratulations!
Wait so she’s engaged but she’s not engaged? WHATS HAPPENING    I’m so happy for you Kayla! Hope you/dan gets the visa (who is getting it)
Awe I'm so happy for both of them 😍 this is great news idk why this video just made me feel happy
Number 23 on trending?! Wow!
Ok sorry... BUT EUROPE IS NOT A COUNTRY kayla!!
Good luck hope you get there with your case
Kayla - So happy you shared this story! About three weeks ago I finally returned to the UK to be with my husband. We were supposed to get married May of 2020, but that got put off for obvious reasons. I was stuck in the UK for 7 months waiting out the pandemic, and then I was forced to return to the USA. Due to travel bans he couldn't come with me, so we decided to fly to Antigua and elope since it was one place we both could travel to. After going through all of the paperwork I finally got my visa early March and we immediately booked the next flight we could. We were apart for 8 months. So many people don't realize how difficult and expensive it is. I'm so glad you shared your story with us.
ayo this is so wholesome what. congrats kayla :)))))
Applying to the US can be more complicated than just waiting a year sometimes. I know it seems a long time when you are invested. I am glad things with the application process are going well. The photos really don't matter.  I think being together is the most important thing and I hope it happens soon for you. Good luck
i saw the thumbnail and i was like huh she looks like lilsimsie..... wait
Wow honey! Congrats! 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳 You guys are so cute together I wish you all the happiness in the world!
Kayla you're not allowed to change your last name from Sims Dan has to change his
Okay but it’s actually so crazy cause I started watching you when you were in your last year of highschool and I was in middle school and now you are a successful, engaged, beautiful lady and I love it for you.
People from her Twitch: 🤡 I totally didn't know this... People from her YouTube: WHA ROSUCNROSHXKFJSJX THATS NEW 🤯 Me who hasn't had coffee yet thinking this was about a break-up: 🤨☕ After noticing she's engaged: KRUWBXIRUSBF *spits out coffee* 😗💦 🤯
I'm so happy for Kayla, and so so jealous. I haven't seen my Australian fiance in 14 months, and we haven't been able to submit our Australian fiance visa as the immigration offices are closed. It hurts to not see him, and I'm just glad that Kayla will get to be with Dan soon. Good luck!!
AHHH IN SO EXCITED FOR YOU
YAYYYYYYY
Ahhhh omg kayla congrats
Aww Congrats Kayla. I'm so happy for you and I hope you and Dan can be together very soon.   Did not know you were engaged!
You are not alone. We postponed our plan for more than a year
Your what? Congrats!!! 🎉🍾
OMG IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU WTF AHHH THIS IS AMAZING
Congratulations you guys! I hope you have a wonderful life together ♥️
OMG I DREAMT ABOUT THIS LIKE LAST WEEK 😱❤️
Congrats babe!!!!!
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU OMF
Hi my husband I had our interview in October I bought a copy of his driver license and it really helped with the interview 😀  the interview is nothing so tell him not to stress about it.
Damn i just started following you, and i can’t explain how happy i am for you! Congrats and lets hope that things will move more quickly now and he’ll be able to move to US!
Congratulations and best wishes for this to move along as quickly as possible!!
Congratulations 🎉!
Glad you guys are having some progress 🎉🎉🎉
this is a great update on this whole process, I have a friend doing the same thing, but she is already married here in South Korea but wants to move back to the states with her husband and it is good to know some of the process she is going through
Yayyyyy!!!!
I'm so happy for you and Dan that there is finally some progress. Really hope you can see each other very fast!!! Congrats! xXx
So happy for you both
Girl I feel you. My husband is from England also and we didn’t see each-other for a year... it sucked... but I was able to get to England in December so I just applied to get married and well. We are married now 😂
I am so frustrated with the UK immigration policy for spouse visas. As you mentioned in the video it it very expensive to sponsor your fiancé or spouse to live with you in the UK. In fact it is so expensive, statistics show that nearly 50% of the people do not make the minimum income requirement to sponsor a spouse. Its totally unfair and in my opinion a breach of human rights but the government do not care. Congratulations on your win.
Congratulations on everything ❤️❤️☺️
Yyyyyyyyaaaaaaayyyyyy
Whenever it comes, it will be beautiful and you will have your whole life together! THEN, because I have been married 21 years, you'll be finding ways for him to give you a break..lol! Love you!
OH SIMSIE!!! I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU AND DAN!!! i am extremely excited for you both!! all the best!
I’ve been here since Kayak was like 15, we’re like the same age, this makes me feel so old but so proud at the same time 😂😭❤️
This is so cute
Congratulations on this exciting time in your lives!
For the two week thing you guys could go on a vacation!
Wait when did they get engaged? Congrats though Kayla!!
Sasha/Vixella got lucky cuz Zeuz has duel citizenship, even tho they arent engaged yet we all know it will happen one day lol. This process sounds painful.
As someone who hasn't seen her own fiance since January 2020, I can relate to this. I'm in New Zealand, and I met my fiance in England. Had to move back to NZ because my work visa expired, and then the pandemic happened. We had had our wedding planned and everything. Now we're working on getting him an entry visa for NZ, which isn't easy because the borders are closed. Believe me, I feel your pain.
I'm so happy for you! congratulations Kayla!
I am sooo happy for yall 😁
How can kayak a 12 year old be engaged? Congrats! I hope everything works well!
what. WHATRTTTTTTtefZfwjdjwdvuwdv CONGRATS KAYLAAA!
Dream wedding in the Sims? 🤔😀
I’M SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS.

CONGRATS ❤️❤️🥰
Me at 20 who has never dated anybody: 😯😆😭
my fiance and i are going through the visa process now, with her immigrating to australia. its insane the amount of paperwork and waiting we you have to do! our processing times are insanity too ugh.  congrats kayla! im with you in engagement photos and no fiance because visa solidarity <3
I have a question. I had no idea how immigration processes work. Let's say years later y'all want to move back to the UK. Would Dan have to repeat the process of becoming a UK citizen again or is he a citizen of both the UK and US now?
@vixella
OMGGGGGGG
Everyone say A BIG Congrats to Kayla.  CONGRATULATIONS KAYLA👍😊😊👏👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉🎉we wish you all the Best. 👍⭐✌️
Congratulationss to both of you!
hey lilsimsie could you renavate the drama school for a video? love your vidoes btw!
OMGGG I CANT BELIEVE THIS!! I remember I started watching u at the beginning of the 100 baby challenge I sadly stopped watching for a min and now I found out that you HAVE A FIANCÉ CONGRATS!! ❤️💕🥰
Does this mean your last name won’t be Sims anymore?
So so SO happy for you!!! Congrats!
I'm in a very similar situation right now, my boyfriend lives in the UK and I live in the Netherlands and covid has just completely messed everything up. stay strong and I hope he can come over to you soon!!
CONGRATULATIONS, HONEY!!! 🥰🎉
Took my abuelos 2 years of saving and hoop jumping to get here with my dad and aunt. Good luck to ya, though I think you’re crazy for staying in this nightmare land (especially as another native Floridian, Fl crazy as hell)
I’m so happy for you and Dan, Kayla. I hope the next couple months go quickly! 🥰
He would’ve been here already had trump implemented harsher restrictions and vaccine distributions when covid first started 🙃
CONGRATULATIONS KAYLA AND DAN! I´m not crying, you are... Well yeah, I´m bawling. Screw pregnancy hormones :D
This video was so helpful bc my boyfriend is from the US and we’ll have to go through this! To have a youtuber that I’m subscribed to explain it to me is so nice seeing as I actually get what you’re saying! 🥰
Kayla I didn't know Dan was more than your boyfriend!! When did you guys get engaged?! 😃
This video was so helpful for me because we are planning the same thing with my boyfriend but it's so hard to get information that is clear for us BUT this video answered a lot of questions. Anyways congratulations!
congratulations!! 🥺🥺🥺🥰❤️❤️
OMG CONGRATS!
Congratulations to you both!
Aw congratulations Simsie and Dan! Fingers crossed everything else goes smoothly. Welcome to the US Dan!
Good luck to both of you! ❤🌹
So happy 4 u
I read the title as, I am sooo engaged.  😆  Congratulations!
where do you apply for the petition thing i wanna do this with my boyfriend and move from the uk to the usa as well but idk what website to use?
Congrats!
Congratulations 🎉
this is so useful because i wanna do the same thing with my boyfriend and its so confusing so this makes it so much more simpler and what we need to do!!
Quiet familiar process for me, I moved by the similar visa to Sweden to my fiancée. And waiting process now is about 2 years or even more now 🙈 I was lucky to get it during only 9 months
OH MA GA
OMG ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Congrats Kayla!!
CONGRATS KAYLA!

Nah but you can see the glow in Kayla, from her happy news and excitement and this is so great to see!
I enjoy how you make it sound like Europe is a country
Homeboy looks like inabber
She’s just one year older than me and got engaged my god what am I doing
I have nothing else to comment here so...   WhEeEeEeEeEe wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee WhEeEeEeEeEe wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  That's all.
Congratulations, Kayla & Dan! Wishing you all the best!
Oh god and I thought the visa process for a J-1 was stressful...
Dan looks like you are you twins
Awwwww(esome) Good for You, Tell Yourf iance to hug You for me <3 :--D
I'm doing this the other way around - I'm from Maryland and have been playing the waiting fiancé game in Wales for months! Congrats to you both (and send good thoughts for my UK visa process)
This is so cute!!!! I'm so excited for them to get married and be so happy.
I am soooo fkn happy for u both ❤❤❤❤❤❤
🎉CONGRATULATIONS 🎉
Europe is not a country, omg...
Congratulations! I'm so happy for you!<3 Good luck with the rest of the prosess!
Y’all irritating in the comments 😂.....if she wanted to get married she can get married like shut up it’s her life not yours y’all doing way too much !
🥺❤️
OMG!! Congratulations baby!!
I would not pay $4000 for my husband, to take him away maybe 😂 Nah congratulations guys, delighted for you!
Awwww, congrats!
10:45 Europe is a continent, not a country......
Ok but this is so much work. You can tell if you’re willing to do all this you love him and he loves you
Congratulations!!!
Omg congratsss
I love your eyebrows❤️
So much empathy for your situation Kayla! My fiancé is American, I’m British and we’ve been going through the visa process in the UK for over a year too. It is such an invasive process and costs literally thousands, especially if you hire an immigration lawyer to help with the application. It’s a lot and can be very tough on your relationship. Anyway, we are finally getting married in the UK next week so are nearly at the end of the road!
I’m so happy for you, I hope he gets here fast!! 😊
Congrats! My now husband and I were also looking at this visa back in the day. Since we lived in Europe and I have an EU passport in addition to a US one it was just easier to stay in Europe. I remember how complicated it seemed when back when we were looking into it before we got married can't imagine trying to do this type of stuff during a pandemic! Must have been extremely frustrating and difficult. Kudos to you and your partner for staying strong throughout.
YES KAYLA IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU! 💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓
Ppl talking about twitch vs YouTube but there’s Me who follows her on Twitter seeing this video: Well finally,  lol
Congratulations!
omgggg Congratulations Simsie<3<3 I am so happy for you guys, its so great when things finally start moving forward
Child mariages are a growing problem in 3rd world countries. Its so sad that you had to go through this 😓
Omg congrats😍😍
I wonder if Prince Harry had all this trouble?
I am so happy for you! But I need to confess part of me is sad you are not coming to live here in the UK! I had hope!
At least where I live, the definition for being engaged is just both parties wanting to marry, so my husband and I just went "oh are we engaged now?" "I guess".
Gurl I am so happy for you two! Wishing from the bottom of my heart that you two meet soon!
Congratulations Kayla, I'm so happy for you both :)
Congrats from Belgium 😘😘😘
Not all countries just some like: EUROPE china and Brazil    EUROPE HAS LOADS OF COUNTRIES.....
Congrats! Also it’s so interesting to hear about even tho I’m single and living in Europe! 🧡
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIII
Congrats!
Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!
Congratulations!
It's nice to hear that I'm not the only one who hasn't seen their partner for a while because of COVID/LDR things. :) Congratulations, and you're doing great!
THIS IS A VERY GOOD DAY
Congratulations I'm so happy for u two .
My fiance and I are about to go through a similar partner visa application for Australia, mine is unlikely to have a decision made for another year or two at this rate, even though we've lived together for almost 3 years! So excited and very happy for you both 🥰
Congratulations! Also, good luck with all this visa stuff. I know how rough enough it was to be states apart from my fiancé, not countries. So, hopefully it all works out for you!
I can't be the only one who thought she was lesbian
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!! I hope he gets to move ASAP! :-)
Congratulations Simsie! Dang I'm nervous when I have to do this in the future X(
wow feels weird cause I'm 22 now and just bought a house with my boyfriend who's 25 now, can't think of getting married / engaging yet! maybe in a few yeard
Congrats
so happy for you!
I know a few people who tried to move to the UK from Australia for their relationship and they ended up splitting because it’s so impossible. Visas are a nightmare. I’m so glad it has worked out for you!!
CONGRATS SIMSIE
Look up “find us in paradise” on Instagram. The woman just moved to Orlando last month to be with her fiancé. My neighbours got permission to travel to Texas for their granddaughters birth. There are work arounds to get him there quicker. So happy for you guys!
Im so so happy for you two. Wish this last progress goes fast for yous!!! 😍😍💕
No one: YouTube: *90 days fiancé ad before video*
Congrats Kayla! Have a wonderful, happy life together in a beautiful blue suburban house ❤😁
Ahh I'm so so so happy for you two!
I actually can’t wait to see Kayla and Dan in the same video frame... does that make sense 😂
I'm so happy for you and Dan! I'm so glad you guys are closer to the end goal! You guys deserve it! ❤️❤️❤️
Yasss u go sis!! Congrats! BTW just curious- is getting married at her age early or late where she's from?
I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU TWO! IT WILL BE AMAZING FOR YOU TO LIVE TOGETHER!
_[congratilation clapping intensifies]_
will i be invited to your wedding
This is such an interesting video, thanks for sharing about it even though it's a bit personal and stuff. Hopefully you both get this all settled and it works out great sometime by the end of the year!~
The biggest smile was on my face when I read that title, I hope things process quickly for you guys
CONGRATS KAYLAA
Congratulations Kayla!  :)
what!! omg congrats!! i’ve been here since the susan stories omg
Why do I just love listening to YouTubers talk
congrats 🍾🎈🎉
My head hurt @_@ i'm going to apply for my bf sometime in the next 2yrs hopefully everything is much faster in the near future but would it be easier to get married before and then apply to get the lawful permanent resident card?
A youtube/twitch couple [Krinx TV] I've been part of the community of for like... 8 years finally got through the UK permanent resident status process a couple months ago after like 2 full years of paperwork hell. I wish the absolute best for you and Dan and hope the process from here on goes smoothly and swiftly.
OMG! Congratulations!
Everything should be open in England by June 21st so fingers crossed everything will be ok!
so you're marrying a duck? seems weird
CONGRATS KAYLA!!! 💗💗
As someone that is dating someone in another country, this is so heckin adorable and I feel it deeply!!! <333
Omg!!!! Congrats!
CONGRATS!!!
You guys look really cute together! I looked at the thumbnail and I was like their just a perfect fit. I wish you and Dan the best in your future!
Wow, congratulations!! I haven’t seen the video entirely yet but I wonder whether they would have gotten engaged as early if the whole visa situation wasn’t a problem? - I’m not hating, just curious
Yayyyyy! Hope the rest of the visa process goes smoothly! Xx
I’m so happy for you!! I’m really excited and I wish you all the best ❤️
CONGRATS KAYLA AND DAN ✨✨
I'm so happy for you two! Fingers crossed that he doesn't have to have an impromptu "vacation" for 2 weeks somewhere.
OKAY since you can't take engagement photos irl what if you made you and Dan in the Sims and took engagement photos of them?? And then try to replicate them irl when he arrives?
Americans: Europe = country 😂
Congratulations! :D
So happy for you 😃❤️
Kayla I'm so excited for you! It will be worth it ♥️♥️♥️
So glad you’ve got that interview date!
His interview is the day after my birthday :) congrats <33
Congrats lovelies😍❣️
Sooooo you’re not going on 90 day fiancé? Dam I would have love that
my s/o is from london too, hopefully we’ll be meeting for the first time soon!!! AH SO EXCITED FOR U
The biggest question should be... how did he propose?! So pleased for both of you x
Congratulations!
CONGRATS 🎉🎉🎉
There reviewing international travel here in the UK soon so hopefully that will help you. Hope it all goes well really happy for u
AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH OMG THIS IS SO AMAZING
But Amira from 90 day fiance wanted to quarantine in Mexico before entering the US and she was stopped at Mexico´s airport...  that didn´t go well... Be careful!
So happy for y’all, Kayla! I hope it all works out soon🥰
this is amazing kayla <3
The whole engagement photos and wedding photos thing I totally understand, I did the same thing but in the UK and we did it as secretly as possible because we knew we couldn't invite everyone to the wedding, so we've got no fun photos either. Luckily we were able to get married before my student visa expired, which was a month before the pandemic began so I never had to get deported. A lot of my friends and family who knew were upset because I didn't come home before we did the quick courthouse wedding, or like planned an "actual wedding", but I've never been more thankful because if we waited any longer we would of had to go through the same thing.
i dint watch it yet but i know ure not engaged
Congratulations!  I've been watching your videos since you were in High School, it's amazing how much you've grown. I hope the rest of this process is smooth and you can see and marry Dan soon. All the best!
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CONGRATULATIONS
I worked at Home Affairs in Australia within the Visa process and I cannot imagine how stressful it is being an applicant. You have people contacting you daily, even hourly wanting updates on their case but there's nothing you can do even when you're someone who processes them. Unsure about other countries and foreign affairs workers but here in Aus, you feel pretty damn useless. Imagine setting up and paying thousands for a Visa to have someone you love come and be with you. Then being on the application processing side and sending information requests off to other foreign governments and having to wait for the results so you can finally tell someone else who has also waited months they're finally good to go. It is draining to say the least.
Yay I’m so happy for you! I got married two summers ago at 20 so that we could get her a French visa and we could live together :)
congrats guys!! hope the interview & everything goes well!! 💛
❤❤❤
you look like siblings
Congrats Kayla!!
Congrats Kayak!
Aaa very happy for you Kayla!! How about a dream wedding setup sims edition?!
So happy for you two that the process is finally moving forward! 😁👍🏽
I live in Istanbul, waiting for Dan. That would be soo much fun!
Yo hold on. I didn’t know Brazil is in a travel ban. That makes me a little happy because a former coworker of mine who was super annoying, became famous on TikTok and moved to Brazil. Now I know he likely won’t be back to visit for a while 😅
you’re are amazing so strong
Immigration office’s suck that the lesson of this video I should know.
Congrats Kayla! :D All the best, international marriages are tough but I'm sure once you guys are together again it will be well worth the wait ✨ I kind of feel your pain (tho it's for diff reasons and applying for a diff visa), in the past I was trying to move to the US to pursue a career in animation, but as I'm considered to be from a 'third world' country and there's so much competition for an O1 visa I highly doubt that will happen 😂 Now I have been looking into Canada instead! Hope you and Dan get to see each other again soon, take care Kayla~
so happy for you!!❤️
ahhh wtf
Haha it’s like her history degree was pushed out to accommodate immigration law 😅 so happy to see that there’s light at the end of the tunnel for you Kayla!
I came to the states on the K1. You can apply for a work and travel permit before you get your greencard. This way you can start working and traveling "early" (I mean, we are still in a pandemic,  so who knows how long thats gonna be). The interviews themselves were kinda whack. Especially the one for the greencard, where you have to "proof" that youre actually in a relationship,  the lady asked us nothing. She just had us confirm our information (name, date of birth, weddingdate) and that was it. She didnt even glance at the provided pictures or anything. Good luck you 2.
My husband and I had to get medical tests done before we got married and we were born in the same state and had lived in the same city for the last 7 years.
She’s engaged?!?!?!?
All the love for you and Dan, Kayla, good luck for the future. I love you and your channel, keep going strong.
That is awesome! I met my now husband on Twitch as well! I was moderating a twitch channel we both watch and both are now mods on. We actually got married in January! I was able to travel there in December. Long distance is insane. I am from the Netherlands and he is from Philly.  Wish you the best luck!
YOU ARE WHAT 😱
“There have been some things that have prevented us from seeing each other” When you try to dodge the word Covid so YouTube can’t be mad about it
I am so happy for you two! I have been quarantaining with my boyfriend since it started and he really is the only thing that keeps me sane. It has been very straining on me in the past few weeks and I really appreciate having somebody that I love with me. Just the pure action of giving me a hug makes my whole day better :) I hope you two can move together as soon as possible
So happy for you Kayla they always say good things happen to people who wait 😄😉
Yay!!!!
Me every time Kayla talks about country’s that are banned from flying to America: "Europe is not a country Kayla!!!!! 😂😂” anyways I’m so excited for youuuuuuuuu
I am an English viewer I felt really heart warmed when you wanted to live here in England 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Yay 😀
Congrats Kayla!! So excited for you guys!!
Guys guys can someone link the twitch video where she announced this??? I'm just finding out!!!!
Yay
Crazy i moved to the States in 2019 because my husband is from the US but then we moved back to UK and my husband got his residency within 6 months that was in 2020 ....
How old are you? Just curious...

Congratulations❤❤❤❤❤😽😽😽😽😽😘😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍

HOW DID KAYAK KELLY KETRONAG KORN KORAL KETRA KEROOONIE KELLOG KLOGGED SIMS A 14 YEAR OLD GET MARRIED Congrats kaylaaa!
Europe is a continent.... However I feel it. I’m moving to Italy and the visa process for Italy was straight forward but the process was wild because I had to travel from Seattle to Tacoma and I don’t have a car. Only to find out most of this could have been done over email...
Congrats that you are finally getting into the next stages of the process. Good luck at teh interview Dan (it's on my birthday btw.)
omg congratulations! i'm sooo happy for you and Dan! 🥺❤
June 29th is my birthday. Count that as a good sign. ❤ I wish you all the best!
Kayak WILL get her engagement screenshots
❤️❤️❤️
No one really thinks about the legality of us immigration :v some cases can take more than decades
14 year old Kayla is getting married😭
Congrats!!! Hope u guys have a lovely marriage! (Soon)
Kayla, I believe that in April we can travel in the UK. So should be okay!!!
CONGRATULATIONS!!! <3
Congrats! 🎊🎉🍾🎈
this is so crazy because you’re only a year older than me and i’ve been watching you since almost the beginning so it’s like we’ve been growing up together in a way. and here you are with your own home and a fiancé while i am living with my parents, single, and jobless shdjdjk but alas, congratulations!!!✨ i’m very happy for you
This is actually really interesting. It’s so complicated to immigrate, I’d like to one day, but it’s definitely difficult to learn about it😂
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Hey, great news!  Just one thing, I’m not sure how medicals work for the visa (private or NHS GP) but don’t underestimate how long it takes to get one during COVID times. We had to get one through our GP (we paid) in the UK for the adoption process and it took months for the doctor to agree. So I would recommend starting now!
I’ve been watching since you were a senior in hs and !!! It’s so crazy that you are doing adult things but I’m so happy for you!
So happy for you!!! Congratulations ❤️
Wait what I watch your streams all the time and never knew he was your fiancé!! Congrats!!
Omg congrats!
Omg Karla i am so happy for you
My husband came from Canada one week before travel ban. We applied for perm residency and waited almost 2 years due to delays because of the administration at the time.
You’re telling me Dan could’ve been the one dyeing your hair twitch purple???
I'm so very happy for y'all, congrats 🥰💖
Good luck
I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOUUU!! CONGRATSSS
congrats girlie!!!!
Congrats 💖
I’m so happy for you guys :)
OMG, congratulations on the process!! I'm on an f1 visa and I know how this process can be, this just takes a lot of patience. Good luck!!
this is so exiting!! congrats!
Kayla, I am so happy for you and Dan! I hope that everything will go well and I wish you two all the best ❤️
omg I followed you when you were still in HIGHSCHOOL and had 10K followers and now you're getting married.  Congrats Lil Simsie <3
Yay!!! Congrats Kayla and Dan! ❤
Omg Kayla I’m tearing up I’m so happy for you guys🥺💕💕💕
I’m so excited for you two 👏🏻
Omg congrats!
Love the news!! Congrats, girl!! We're all excited for you two!
This is the most casual, nonchalant engagement announcement I’ve ever watched. Congratulations! 🙂❤️
congrats!!!!
My mom has recently been obsessed with 90 day fiancé and when I saw this pop up in my notifications I was like oh god it’s following me
I feel like i’ve watched you grow up even though i’m like 4yrs younger than you😂 Congrats!
So did he propose or was this a mutual decision??? Congrats I’m so happy for you and Dan ☺️☺️☺️☺️
I GET TOO EMOTIONAL WITH HAPPY NEWS I CAN'T DO THIS 😭
I started the process of getting my ex to come here for him and I to get married but after he showed his true self it stopped obviously, but from what I hear from this I'm SUPPER glad to hear that I didn't go through that whole process knowing he would have just gotten rid of me as soon as he could
So excited for you guys <3
CONGRATULATIONS
So if Dan can’t work once he moves here, he can’t stream then right?
So sorry the immigration system is such a mess!!
This sounds like a hallmark movie in the making. But joggers for you and Dan! super duper happy for you guys. <3
congratulations simsie!!!
Congrats!💞
Congratulations! I'm from England living with my now husband in the US. I know the process VERY well.... also the medical exam for girls is a little more... *ehhum* personal. They check for FGM. It was a awkward conversation and examination but hey, did what I had to do lol. Also they take a xray of your chest for TB. My green card renewal was delayed by over a year because of covid. I hope it's smooth sailing for you both! It was a loooong process and so much money. But it's all worth it ♡♡♡♡ also we were approached by 90 day fiance to be on the show! We turned it down because we didn't want the drama and are actually in love.... we would have been boring haha. The money would have been nice though 😂
KAYLA IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU AAAAAH
So..... congrats 🤘🏼💕💏 in 3years = 👶🏼🧸🥺
ok it’s so shocking to see sweet lil kayla go all the way to MARRIAGE.. proud of her tho 🥲 congrats kayak 🛶
congrats kayla! hope the process goes well <3
i’ve been watching you since you were 16 this is so crazy
MY best friend left me here in Canada and moved to Texas and it took him 2 years and a ton of hoops to jump through.  Congrats on your engagement!,
Wow you're engaged?!?! :O congrats :)
ahhhhhhhhhhhh congrats!!
CONGRATS KAYAK
Oh my god, im so happy for you!!!!! That is truly some great news that we're all happy to hear about ;)
your appointment is the day after my birthday! ill send a special birthday wish into the universe for his interview to go great :3
Will we be seeing Dan frequently ?
AAAAAAHHHH so happy for youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
I'm 20 and also in a long distance relationship, so I understand the struggle with seeing each other.. I luckily am only across the county, but during 2020 we were fully unable to see each other the whole year. We luckily have started seeing each other this year. I'm so glad you guys figured out a way for him to move here and be with you😊
AHHH IM SO HAPPY!!!! IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS❤️❤️❤️
now imagine all that but being black or from a country that the united states considers inferior 😍😍😍
I am so happy for you both and cant wait to see more updates :)
Congratulations
the numbers are dropping in the UK, so by July there is a chance that the UK will be exempt from the rest of the US. fingers crossed
Congratulations! I had a courthouse wedding 15 years ago with a party a few months later. No regrets. So happy for you!
AHHHHH CONGRATS GIRLL!!!💜💜
congrats kayla!!!
so happy for you kayla <3
I’m so excited for you I ran to my step dad yelling THEY SCHEDULED AN INTERVIEW THEY FINALLY PROCESSED THE PAPERS! And he looked at me like excuse me.. who?
Would you be able to quarantine in another country with him???? If so, what a great way to catch up on all the missed time. ❤ So happy for you!
I'm so happy for you. I was engaged and moved 600 miles away, still in the US (I could only imagine your situation!!), but things didn't work out. I pray things do for you!! I remember all of what waa going through Dan's head, lol. Good luck and happy days ahead for you and him!!
Her intro was so my BF fiancé and just disregarded that she said that I was like what????? Edit she said Europe is a Country
i feel like a proud mom rn i remember watching kayla and she was just graduating hs now she’s engaged im so happy for you!
don't mind me just over here crying with happiness for you both 😭 i've been watching your videos since you had 10k-ish subs, i've watched you grow up, i'm so freaking proud of you! i'm over here in aus, nearly 24yo, mental state at disability levels of bad, watching a 21yo on the other side of the world overcome her own mental demons and get the happiness she deserves 💜💜
Awe! I'm so happy for you and Dan!
Omg congrats!!
so your saying, i can marry draco malfoy, but i have to fill out paper work? ok one sec
I am in the painful process of not having met my partner in person yet. Despite us being together for a year and a half. We had plans to meet last year but yeah, Pandemic Monster crushed all dreams and it's so unbelievably difficult to not be with them. They're going through a lot right now and everyday I feel sad that I can't be there to help them get through it. Here's hoping we can see each other, at some point, this Summer.
PLEASE KAYLA GO ON 90 DAY FIANCE THAT WOULD MAKE MY ENTIRE LIFE 😩💖🥺
Congratulations!!
And I thought it was difficult for my fiancé and I  as we are trying to get married, at least we have the benefit of both of us being natural born citizens. I’m definitely not going to complain anymore. I hope everything else goes smoothly for you guys.
YESS💖
I’m so happy for you 😭😭 I teared up with you by the end 🥺🥺 Hope everything works out!
Congratulations!!!!
Yikes getting my spouse’s visa to Canada was a nightmare
Congratulations Kayla 🥳
Lilsimie: getting engaged. Me exactly same age as her: You guys even thinking about having a boyfriend but not go for higher studies and jobs?
OMG CONGRATS!!!
KAYLA OMG IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU,,,, congrats hon!!! You guys are going to be so happy together!!
Build your dream wedding venue in the sims!
I want to hear how y'all got engaged!
Immigration processes is so stressful 😫  And time consuming
WHAT IM SO STOKED!!!! Can you build something weddingy on sims???? Love to you both x
Hi so I am in tears oh my god
Aw congrats. I hope your ultimate critic, Snap the cat 🐱 likes him.😁😁
Kayla is talking about being engaged all chill meanwhile I’m freaking out!! Congratulations Kayla and Dan!! 🥺💕
Congrats
Omg I'm so happy for you, Kayla! Wish you guys the best! Watching you from 🇧🇷 btw! Love u
timeline of your life but sims version-
Oh yes, the visa costs. I only had a travel visa (it expired), but when I applied to Portuguese citizenship it was SO. EXPENSIVE. Also it’s so sad to hear Brazil is banned, not because of the ban itself but because it just reminds me how dire our situation is :(
Wait you engaged?!
Kayla, that is amazing! WOOOOOO!!!!!!
KAYAK IS ENGAGED?! I AM SHOCKED  but okay this really is fantastic, i really hope the rest of this goes smoothly for y'all, you've been waiting so long.
WHY IS NOBODY FREAKINGDDH OYT
i always assumed dan was coming here on a work visa. i’m 9 mins into the video and it’a still surreal hearing simsie say “intent to MARRY”
My friend at work applied for the exact same visa about 18 months ago, finally in the last couple of weeks they have started to process it so he should be here in a few months now. I feel for you guys being apart for so long, I’ve seen what my friend went through and it sucked!  Good luck to you and Dan 🤍
How is Kayak a 12 year old banned from tik tok getting married?!? I'm 21 and never been asked on a date.    In seriousness though, congrats Kayla!  But seriously, I'm 21 and never been on a date...
THAT WAS THE LOUDEST IHA EE JDSEVER SCREOAMED
Wait how old are you
Here is the thing, do I or someone I love going through this? no. Was it good to know? Yes :) Thanks for teaching me something.
Mazal tov!
Omg! Congratulations!!! When did you get engaged!???
I’m so happy for you both💞
WHAT OMG
I’m all for Simsie making sims of each of them and taking virtual engagement photos with imposter computer people.
Kayla!! He may be here by your birthday!! That’s so amazing!! I’m so happy for you both!!
<3 happy for y'all
Why is it so pricy to request paper work in the US?
I’m so happy for uuuuu🤧🤧🤧
this is amazing!!!! Congratulations!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’m in this with you! This has been such a long process for us. My fiancé is in France. Our petition was approved last month, but no dates schedule for interviews yet. We had plans to spend most of 2020 together but then travel bans happened! I haven’t seen him for a little over a year... to make things harder I had our baby in October. He hasn’t met his son, and it’s been 6months. I wish we would’ve gotten in on this whole lawsuit and maybe things would’ve been expedited. But it’s kinda nice to know we’re not the only ones being kept apart.
KAYLLAAAAAAAA!!!!! 💓💞💘💖❣️💕💞💓💗💞💘❣️💞💓❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️❣️
I watch 90 day fiancé and I never got that it was a trial. For me I don’t understand how they only give you 90 days to get married. That is such an incredibly short amount of time!  I mean they are trying to make sure that you both are doing it for the right reasons then you have this 90 day period to get married. Makes no sense to me but. Most of the couples from that show are a hot ass mess!   It seems like you two have spent a lot of time together. He has visited you multiple times for months at a time so that is really good! I wish you nothing but the best!! 💕
ive been watching you since you were in highschool and now you're engaged. holy crap kayla. I'm so happy for u
Congrats to u and dan i am so happy for u and dan gb be safe
I love how she used "we" for everything in the video 💕 congrats simsie
Congrats!!❤
i’m from new zealand but live in the us now and jesus it does take long
OMG CONGRATSSSSS
Congrats💕💕
I’m so incredibly happy for you!!
If he needs to quarantine he can do it in Puerto Rico, its a US territory, mostly bilingual and its close to the US.
my cousin and her fiancé have been dealing with this same situation for the past year. thank you for talking about it, i had no idea what was actually going on during the process!
How can Kayla, a 14 year old, be engaged?
Omg just like sims 4 😲😮😲😮😲😮😲😮😲😮
POGGERS
Congrats!
OH MY GOSH CONGRATULATIONS KAYLA
AHHHHHHH KAYLA!!!!! I’m so happy 🥺❤️
i clicked on the video trying to keep calm and expecting that this was just a clickbait title...AND NOW I CAN START FEELING SO FREAKING HAPPY FOR THEM OML <3
Congratulations, Kaylaaa! 💗
Stop it RIGHT NOW !!!!! CONGRATS 😭😭♥️♥️   Edit: I’m a fake fan I literally had no idea
CONGRATS!!!!
AHHH! Kayla what the heck this is amazing!
the susan stories felt like it was just yesterday
I’m so disappointed. Marriage, BEFORE marriage!? Unsub :(
Umm your skin looks amazing. Like more than usual! 😍
Why do you have to have a visa anyway? It seems stupid I don't think you need one in Australia
My cousin applied for that same visa in 2019 as well as a spouse visa in December the same year for his now wife in Mexico. The pandemic hit just before her interview and so she’s had trouble getting here
omg!!!!  to be honest, i wasnt an old fan of yours since you're in high school or anything. I found this channel during the pandemic time and now it kinds of become my daily routine to watch your sims content. And i'm really happy to hear that you're engaged. You guys must have been through a lot of consideration and courage to make this decision. CONGRATS WISH YOU LUCK IN APPLYING THE VISA!!!
This is so cute :3 congrats kayak
Congrats Kayla And Dan Hope You Will Be As Happy As You Are Today♥
omg i’m so happy for you
I can’t believe i’ve been watching her since middle school and now she’s getting married🥺oh my god
the only way i made it through the pandemic is because of my bf
I’m so happy for you both!! It sounds like quite the tedious process but it’ll be so worth it. Congratulations!
I’m going through the same thing. I haven’t seen my bf in a year in a half. It’s so comforting to know someone else is going through this!
Did you draw you eyebrows? They look a bit uhh odd?
Omg Dan can say he's marrying the Sims! Lol!!  (Her last name is Sims if you didn't know)
oh my god :') <33333333
Congrats!
You guys should have a virtual wedding... in the SIMS!!! I'm sure you could make a really good pun since your last name is literally Sims.
Dan better take her last name so they can be The Sims Family!!!
"you cant work for like 6 to 9 months" 69 MONTHS??
Congratulations!!!!!🎉🎈🍾🎊
Who's last name are you getting? I feel like it would be weird if your last name wasn't Sims
OMG! ❤️
We need all sorts of cute/cringy wedding/couple sims builds
I thought for sure she was pranking us, but I am so happy it’s true!! Congrats Simsie!!!
I gasped when I saw the title- omg I remember watching her when she was still a high school senior, complaining about susan tormenting her and now she's all grown up :) Congratulations beauty
Sounds like you could just have a cool 2 week pre-honeymoon vacation in Mexico. 😂 A friend of mine is also going through this but her fiance is from South Africa. They’re planning on making it a joint trip if he has to quarantine.
OMG I almost died. I'm sooooo happy for you!!! Congratulations
WHYD I NOT GET THE NOTIFICATION JNTIL NOW WJAT

AUYSFHUYHDFSUIHPIUFHSIOJDFIOUDHXZFUIOIUHUIOEHAGOUISFDFGIOUH IM SO FREAKING PROUD OF YOU GUYS OH MY GOD/   IM SOBBINGNGNNGNGNG
I am going through this right now, Sweden to USA and it is BS with the pandemic but got my Green Card now :D
oh my god I am so happy for you both! congratulations!
Congratulations
congrats!!🥰😍
Ok but how are you just gonna gloss over the fact that you're engaged! How did it happen? When's that story dropping?
@lilsimsie I went thru the CR1 vis with my husband, we sent in about 5 pounds of evidence of being in a relationship(photos text msges since the start, receipts of gifts we bought each other, hotel registrations that we both stayed at during his business trips to the USA, bank accounts, etc etc etc.). He was only asked 5 questions at his interview  1: How did we met  2: When was the last time we saw each other 3: Where did we see each other last 4 What I did for a living 5: What he did for a living  Other people that were being interviewed at the same embassy had harder questions.  Right now we are preparing for the Removal of Conditions.  I hope his questions are as easy as ours was.   CR1 took from Jan 3rd 2018 till Nov 27th 2018 (interview). We got a RFE at interview for hubs CV so the government could do more in-depth background check, due to the nature of his career. Submit the next day, and got approval mid March 2019.
Me sees thumbnail: oh cool kayla is engaged Me 0.3 scondes later: wait WHAT!!!!
So, is Lil' Simsie and Duck Dan's ship name Lil' Duckie? If not, can we please make that their ship name?
So happy you could finally make this video!!! <3
Hope everything works out!
"........ and brazil"  chorando in brazilian
OMG CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! 🥺❤️
OMG CONGRATS
By the way the partner visa in Australia is 6000$ (without health check and stuff) And I get it. I was really obsessed with the whole visa process. Especially since we also applied at the end of 2019 so.... I checked the visa status like 2,3 times a day for a year.
Congratulations!!!
OMGGGGGGGG
And then there’s Australia: partner visas cost almost 8k 😂without lawyer fees
congratulations !!!
I didn't even know you were engaged. Congrats!!!
i’m younger than you and i’m over here getting emotional for no reason 😭🤚
Kayla, this is so exciting for you! My husband and I applied for an IR-1 Visa and I just had my interview last week. Word of advice - I brought his tax return, what they wanted was his tax transcript, since he is self employed. Now we have to submit that before they will admit my visa.
AHHH I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU, I FEEL LIKE I'M ABOUT TO CRY FOR YOU AHHH I'M SUPER EXCITED FOR YOU AND DAN!!
Congratulations for your engagement!🙂
God, it always astounds me how people are going through very different things everyday. Just broke up with my long term boyfriend today, and you're getting engaged. I'm happy for you, just a bittersweet reminder. I wish you two well <3
I SAW THIS AND SCREAMED YAY I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU CONGRATULATIONS now build your wedding in the simsss
KAYLA OMG!!! CONGRATULATIONS FINALLY! <3
Omg I’ve been with my partner for 4 1/2 years and we’re still not engaged. But I also got my partner visa for Australia without getting married. And we are planning on getting married soon.
Hi Kayla! I've been waiting on my fiance and i's K1 visa since April 2020 we just heard back from the NVC!!! He is in South Africa the last time I seen him was January 2020 when I went to visit and meet his family. Gave birth to our beautiful daughter June 15th over FaceTime and he still has yet to meet her in person and she's 2 months away from being a year😭 I can't wait for the day they get to meet eachother face to face and have my little family together!!!!
LILSIMSIE SUED THE UK GOVT AND WON!! WE STAN
CONGRATS :)
I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!!!!! congrats, i am sending good thoughts to you and dan and hopefully the process is quick from now on
great now have a sims 4 themed wedding queen
omg??
Also super excited for you’re engagement I cried too and sent a picture to my bf and told him how happy I was for you. Don’t worry I made sure he was up to date on your k1 status
CONGRATULATIONS ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
so.. this made me tear up. im so so so happy for you two <3
I am so so excited for you both, especially after the long process to get this sorted you’ve talked about on twitch! I’m so happy for you and can’t wait to see you happy and together again!!
Simsie answer this: will Dan be able to stream during the time he isn’t able to stream?
My boyfriend is a UK citizen and I’m from Austria so it’s a bit easier for us, but Brexit has kind of screwed us over a bit. I’ve applied for Pre-Settled Status in February and I still haven’t gotten an answer 😭 It’s frustrating, even if it’s just two months, now imagine more than a year...waiting this long must be awful, but I’m so happy you guys finally got to hear from them! :)
Oh my god I’m so happy for you!
She’s growing up so fast 🤧🤧🤧
I’m supposed to be studying in Germany this summer and the process for that alone has been incredibly stressful so I can’t even imagine what kind of hell this has been for you.
I may be pretty unique in that I actually know what the process is for the K1 visa because I’ve been through it! I was a 90 day (although I got married in 65 days) fiancé! 2 years married in May! Congratulations on the next step!
OMGGGGGGG that's so cuteeeeeee
is he like irish
I THOGUHT THIS WAS FOR APRIL FOOLS
Congrats Kayla!!
Congratulations!!!
You deserve all the good things! ❤️❤️
Wowowow congratulations!!!!!! <3
I literally cried watching this video. Congrats!!!!
WTF CONGRATS ❣😁❣
OMG CONGRATS!!!!!! AHHHH!
Suing the Government is probably the biggest W
Why did I tear up at this omg 😭❤ congrats Kayla!! So happy for you
Woah
Hi Kayla! You may not see this but in hopes that you do, I want to reach out to you to ask more about this visa thing. My boyfriend and I (He lives in Canada and I'm in Oregon) are trying to see what options we have for getting started on the K1 visa and we're stuck and don't know where to start! Any tips would be sooo helpful, we're desperate!
the irony of the euro travel ban is how bad covid is in the USA
OMG I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
OMFG I am so happy for you!
I’m so happy for you both!!
Yayyyyyyyy
Does anyone know what time she starts streaming on twitch?
Most people: stuck in the house with their partner.  Kayla: I can’t see my partner   😢
Whenever you have your big wedding down the line I wanna see a wedding planning vlog series!!!
Congrats, Kayla!!!
My fiancé is also in the UK. Luckily we plan on living in our separate countries for the majority of our marriage so the paperwork is sooooo much simpler. Still a lot though.
OH EM GEE
Congratulations to both of you, this is wonderful news. <3
Oh my goodness just thinking about how far she’s come and now she’s engaged ahhh congrats!
How old she is? I was think that she was like 18
I’m so happy for you!!!!!!!!!
Congratulations  !
I love your natural look...except for your eyebrows.
i remember watching her right when she started college and now she’s getting engaged. how time flies 😭
This is 100% the best video you have put out simply because it is about you genuinely being happy and excited!!! I am so happy for you! Best of luck to both of you in the rest of the process 💕
Congrats Kayla & Dan! This is very exciting for you both and congrats on successfully suing the government! That's badass.  I'm also a Kayla that married a Dan at age 21. (Those Dan's make good partners.)
I THOUGHT YOU POSTED THIS ON APRIL FOOLS BUT NO ACK CONGRATULATIONS
Congrats on the engagement! As someone who just got married at 20, here is some advice for anyone. Ignore the people who say "oh my gosh you're so young! Why would you get married?! You can't enjoy life now. You're only getting married to be rebellious". I heard it constantly from my monster in laws and worse. Love your partner and do you ♡ congrats
Ummm.... Kayla?!! Will this Interview be featured on tv or youtube?!👁👄👁
My fiance and I are both 21 and getting married next May! We've been together for 3 years as well! We were long distance for a while (him in Florida, me in Virginia) but he finally moved up here last year! So exciting!
Before Me?! What!? How is this happening to me? Lol 😂 Congratulations 🎉🍾 that’s so amazing and I hope this stupid pandemic is over soon so you and others can have the awesome wedding they want and for people to travel again!
Waittt, i didn't watch the video yet. Did you go on 90 day fiancé????
Oh man, Dan giving up that free healthcare for the US craziness. He must love you lots!
Seriously, thank you so much for this video. I've been wondering about this whole visa process for quite a while and at least now i know roughly how long it's gonna take and how much we're gonna have to fork out. You're a lifesaver!! ❤️
Are you guys gonna do "it?"
But kayak's only 13
Congrats!!!!
Congratulations! Wishing you all the happiness in the world.
Baby Im soooo proud of you! That's our kayak🤗
one of the girls on 90day fiancé flew to mexico from France and wasn’t allowed to stay. she had to go back to france.
CONGRATS
Congratulations!!!! So thrilled for you!
Congratulations, Kayla and Dan!
Yay! I'm so thrilled to hear about all of this!
I just got so happy! I’m very excited for you both!
I’m so happy and excited for both of y’all!!!
Mazel Tov to you both 💖
Everyone, look where our little kayak has gotten
From the twitch gang: we love you! Don’t be nervous about the YT reaction!
Congratulations!!!
Why do I feel like my child is getting married ? 😭💖 wow Kayla congratulations!!! I’ve watched you grow up and Im soooo happy for you 💖
Thought this would be another flashy-ring videos some YouTubers do... But it's Kayla so it's gotta be more interesting than that!  Very informative and congratulations!
This popped up on my home page and i just jaw dropped... CONGRATULATIONS KAYLA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I remember when she was a young highschooler putting a bunch of noodles in her pool to celebrate 50k...
That’s amazing! Congratulations!🎉
Who could blame you for being excited? Considering the circumstances you should be elated to finally have the ball rolling, it kinda reminds me of what getting married in WWII with situations at the time finding a lot of couples being in the air of any wedding celebrations. Truly hope all goes well on your end.
So question, if Dan isn’t allowed to work for nine months, does that mean he won’t be allowed to stream?
I screamed when I saw this! Ahhhhhh I'm so happy for you! Congratulations!
My uncle got his new wife, fiancé at the time, to the US 2 days before the travel ban. She moved here from Columbia, and they were trying to get her here. They finally did, and as I said, two days later all travel to the US was stopped because it was at the height of the pandemic. Only US citizens coming home were allowed to return if I remember right.
Yay! Congrats Simsie! Best of luck on that process. It's a long, expensive and difficult road.
how does kayla, a 14 year old, get married?
Kayla u are not alone you have us and u have Snap
im so happy for you kayla. ive seen you since you were in highschool and now youre getting married. i hope you so many amazing things come your way along with dans, congratulations!!
simsie!!!!!!! I'm so happy for you and Dan! I cried happy tears for you THREE times! parasocial relationships are wild. but I'm so glad you've chosen to share this part of your life with us! we all can't wait for you and Dan to be reunited!!!!! yay!!!!!!
Yay, congrats! I’m so happy for you :)  Hey… you linked your twitch stream to someone else lol The twitch link opens a different streamer. I know what the purpose is, but the link won’t lead you to your page at all on mobile
My Cousin's wife is Russian, they met when his family was on holiday there when he was a teenager, despite having the normal number of evidence the Australia Government did NOT believe that it wasn't a mail order bride situation (because its russia) and required evidence that they had been communicating for a significant time prior to the engagement. Welecome 10 yrs of facebook messages.
Omg I’m so happy for you!
AHHHH IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
Can we have a proposal story?!?!?!?!?!
I feel your pain. My partner moved from the US to the UK 10 years ago this year and it is so long and so hard and so damn expensive! Congrats!
In the name of Jesus he WILL get that visa and WILL be able to come to the US.
I am so happy for you both.  ♥♥
I get you girl, my bf is in the uk and we've been trying to see each other for a while now. Its been impossible
Screaming!!
Aww I'm so happy for kayak!
I've been here since you were ranting about highschool way back when 🥺 I can't believe this 😭😭😭 congratulations I'm so happy for you
OMG OMG OMG 🖤 CONGRATULATIONS KAYLA 💕 AWWW. DUDE when I saw this my mouth fell OPEN!!!!! OMG
omg i’ve known since you first announced it on twitch but i’m still so happy for you both!! how exciting ❤️❤️
can we invite susan to your wedding?
Congrats!!!!!
Why did I thought this was April’s fools...CONGRATS!!
the video in 5 points: •Kayla sued the government 😎 •Theres a pandemic going on (I didn't know this cause I don't go out-) •Kayla has a double life - Twitch/YT •Dan lives in the Uk so they haven't seen each other for a long time •They have to wait another like 6 months + the year they've already waited
OH MY GOSH CONGRATS!!!!!!! YAYAYAYAY I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU KELLY!!!!!!!!!
OMG KAYLA
Congratulations, Kayak and Kayak’s boyfriend! So so happy for you! ❤️❤️❤️
CONGRATS!!
HUHHH
It's ridiculous I worked customer service for immigration for 3 yrs total bs system
Kelly you’re fourteen. What is going on! No hand holding before marriage.
wow i watched kayla finish hs now i get so see her ENGAGED wow i’m so proud
omg
I can't wait for you to get married! Do you plan on having a family?
AHHH CONGRATULATIONS!!!!🎉🥳🥳
This is the first time I see someone get engaged at 21, they are mostly late 20s above. My PARENTS wasn't even engaged at early 20s, congrats lil sims  Edit: First time seeing it done in social media and this overall decade
this feels so weird and nice, we like fr watched kayla grow up and stuff, and just imagine her in any situation that isnt seatin playin sims in her office desk is just like so surreal and stuff. Whenever she like idk films herself cookin and stuff it feels weird, is it just me? Idk i genuinely can't believe she like has an actual life besides youtube, its so hard to imagine her in a car and gettin engaged and eatin food and goin to the toilet, like i can only picture her face in the same angle talkin to us like is it just me? im like shocked i love her
Congratulations to you and Dan! You guys will have a weight lifted once this is all over. A lot of people are clueless what the process of obtaining any sort of visas in this country is. The vetting system is crazy and the biometric testing is more than someone who is born here ever gets done lol. It took my husband 3 years for him to become a resident!
STOP IMM SOOOO EXCITED
AHHHH
This delights me
NO WAY
OMGGGGGGG!
I'm so so happy for you !!!!!
OMG ENGAGED???????? 🥰❤️🥺
CONGRATULATIONS!!
WHAT
Twitch chat got it first
I am really interested in this whole process, actually, so I really appreciate the breakdown. At first it was really concerning to me that you were getting married so young but whoo. That work visa. I get it. And a courthouse ceremony is definitely the right choice for right now. Have more of a party in animal crossing or something.
So happy for you!! I learned so much from this. No wonder people come here "illegally" when the process is so cumbersome tbh. Congrats on your engagement and I can't wait to see your pictures!!
Yay Kayla!!!
Congratulations!
When I saw this I cried cuz I was So happy for you! Congrats!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA IM SO EXCITED FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!
Oh my gosh!!!! Congratulations!!!! You two deserve this so much, I’m so happy that the process is moving forward!!!
CONGRATS KAYLA!!!
The funny thing is my bday is June 29th lol
Does Cletus know?  lol
CONGRATSS WHATTT
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH 💍 💒
Congrats to you both
OH MY FUCKING GOSH
I am so happy for you ! I've experienced about the same thing, even though I (French) married to a Chinese man, in China. I was already in China as a student at the time so it was more simple, but OMG I know about the anxiety while checking the visa status. Congratulations to you two !
Congratulations, guys💜! I can't imagine how frustrating the whole process is, but I'm glad you sued the government 😂 and now it's moving along ✨
So happy for you ❤️
Omg congratulations simsie
Yesssss mammmm
My brother also has his life in the hands of the government, he has a place at a language school in Japan but is currently waiting on borders. It's so weird for him too knowing that he could just get told it's time to move at such short notice. It's crazy. Good luck to you, hopefully it's smoother sailing for you from now on xx
so happy for the both of you omgg
CONGRATS KAYLA AND DAN!!!!!!
Kayla, I am so proud of you guys! My husband is from Serbia. Luckily, he was already in the US when we met. It is definitely a stressful waiting process.  Also, Serbia is not currently included in the travel ban.
So how long have you been engaged for?
CONGRATS BESTIE
Hey his interview is on my birthday so maybe all use my birthday wish for you guys lol good luck
This was really interesting. Thanks for sharing! I hope everything goes smoothly and you can be together soon!! Congratulations!
WAIT IM CRYING
WHAT OMG
Aw thats such a shame that this has been such a long process for you! Hope all goes smoothly from now on 🙂
congrats!!
Omg congrats!!!!!! 🎉
okay I was kind of confused for this entire video but congrats Kayla! <3<3
Congrats i am sooo happy for you
OMG YESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!! WOOHOO CONGRATS!!!!!!
🥰🥰🥰
Aww, I work for USCIS (not in the visa approval process) but I know very well how it works. Wishing you the best of luck!
Congrats kayla!!!!
Wait so then what day DO you think Dan will be here by? I don’t think that question got answered...
Congrats!!! I also got engaged last week 💍
Hearing all these terms brings back (terrible horrible) memories. I went through this almost 10 years ago to come live with my American now-husband (spoiler alert, everything went okay ;) of course that was not during a pandemic, my goodness, I'm so sorry, I can't imagine how stressful this must be!
She might not talk about it that much, but all the effort they had to go through explains just how much they love each other. For a 21 year old, simsie's mind is mature way beyond her age.   Wishing you a happy, healthy, (future) married life. 🥰💞
Congratulations! He will be there in no time :) I've spent three years working on getting my Green Card, one of which was during the pandemic. It sucks, it's terrible, and it continuously makes me think "Is it even worth it...?" Your patience and dedication shows how much you guys love each other and want to be together! I wish you good luck, you're almost in the finish line! :)
When a 14 year old kayak gets engaged and you have no one...
I’m so incredibly happy for you! Me and my boyfriend have been doing long distance for almost three years now and the pandemic has definitely put a spin on it. Not knowing when you can see your partner next is painful. I’m so glad you now have that date ❤️
Congratulations! I’m so excited for you
I'm so happy for you!
I got married in the UK and had to apply for my husband to come to the US as a permanent resident. Thank GOODNESS we were together for the stressful process. I can't imagine being apart!
You know it’s love when you go through these lengths to be together. Damn! This is making my head spin. I feel lucky to have met my husband in the same town I grew up in...through mutual friends.
congrats!!!!!!
I’m so excited for you to get married 💍😁
So,my fiance is American but I am Canadian. Moving here is much easier than moving to the states. Our plan was to get married may 5 2020. I finally was able to get him over the border on March 8th. We are getting married may 1. And then we get to start paying immigration fees. Good luck to you both
damn i've been watching since 70k :') congrats!!!
Europe is my country👍🏻✨
i am SO HAPPY that things are finally moving forward for you both!!!! hearing you talk about it for the past however many months has been so eye opening and i've just been keeping my fingers crossed for you both and !!!!!! finally you have a rough idea on when he'll be there and i just, i'm so so happy for you both. so so happy. this video is super interesting too, i have family who've moved from the us over here to the uk and vice versa and i know the process is long and hard but it's super interesting to actually hear about it in detail and i'm so sorry that it takes so much time and money for you to just be together but it's going to be so worth it in the end. i'm honestly just super happy for you both and i hope it all doesn't take too much longer now. all the love <3
Im so happy for you honey❤️‼️ My mom is in the process with her husband (step father) in Trinidad and I knew some of the process but not everything and now that you’ve explained it,    im in awe and proud you and your fiancé for sticking it out👏🏾👏🏾
"im engaged" WE'VE BEEN KNEW
my British husband came to the states to marry me (on a visitor visa) and then had to go back to the UK. we thought it would be about 6 months until we saw each other again....that was January 2020. I haven't seen him since then. we finally have enough money to pay for my visa but we still have to save enough for me to actually move there and look for a job. I definitely feel your pain Kayla, immigration always sucks but this year was 10 times worse. I'm so glad things are looking up for you!
I'm so glad to hear that things are on the up and up! I think sending him on a vacation for a couple weeks sounds like a fun thing to do if it will expedite the process and if you can afford it.
congrats kayla❤️❤️
I’m so happy for you both, Kayla and Dan!!!!
I love that she couldn’t post this yesterday bc we would’ve thought it was an April fools prank
I'm so happy for you 💓
OMG i am gonna go cry I need to make a wedding venue on the sims gallery for you ;-;
I know just how hard to get a visa of any kind, I’m glad that you finally get the chance for an interview so excited for you Kayla!
how old are you😐
Honestly? Congrats Kayla! You really deserve this! I’ve been loving to watch your content over the past few months and you never disappoint! You are really a hard worker! You 100% deserve it!
omg I'm so happy for you!!!!!! I'm from Denmark and moved to the US some years back and have gone through several visa processes since; it definitely isn't easy moving here. But again, just so happy for you <3
im crying im so happy for you 🥺🥺💗💗
So exciting!! It makes me happy to see how happy you are! Congratulations! 💕💕
I'm so so happy for you both 🖤 I feel like the hard part about the pandemic is finally starting to be over and we're healing at the same time. you will be so happy living together and I wish you both the best ☺️
Damn, Kayla really messed up with her title here. Should have gone the clickbait route, and titled this "I sued the US Government...and won!" lol.
i am sooo happy for you <33
Awww Kayla!! This is so exciting for you!!! This whole process sounds so interesting and stressful. I might have to go through the same tbh because my boyfriend lives in Mexico so in the future, we may be going through the same thing! I'm so happy for you and Dan <3
I’ve been through this immigration Spouse visa and it’s a nightmare! So happy for you two!
This made me cry, I'm so happy for you. I'll keep you guys and your case in my prayers! Much love lilsimsie
I remember watching you before you had 10k, I’m so proud of you ❤️❤️❤️ congrats on getting engaged 🥲🥳
So happy for you guys 👏🏼✨ wish the best for y’all 🤗
I am also long distance, I know how it is not being able to see your bf/gf. Congratulations Kayla🥳🥳
💖😭😭😭♥️♥️♥️♥️
Thanks for talking about this! This is good information to know. I’ve never actually thought about how the process worked
Will she still wear a pretty dress for the courthouse wedding? 🥺
❤️❤️
congrats on all your successes in life <3
CONGRATS KAYAK
AHHHH YESSSS CONGRATS
Omggg I’m gonnna cry! Congratulations on your engagement & I wish you many happy times to you and your hubbbyyy!
Am I the only one hearing about her being engaged
I’m so happy for you, Kayla! <3
CONGRATSSSES!
Today is my 38th anniversary!  🎉 🎉  🥂 (Don’t understand how we’ve been married that long, we’re not that old! 🤣) I’m wishing you both the very best for a long, long time! ❤️
So happy for you guys! My husband and I got married at the courthouse and we have no regrets! We got married right before covid shut everything down so our party with our family won’t be until later this year but it’s been so great just being married that we don’t even care! Sending you blessings for a happy marriage and a smooth immigration process moving forward! 💕
Congrats and it’s so cool being able to hear about how the visa process works
I can’t believe how time has flown I feel like it was only yesterday Kayla was graduating high school and now look at her!! I’m so happy for you simsie!!
I haven’t watched Kayla in a hot minute but I love seeing little updates show up about her life, ahh feels like just yesterday I was watching her videos, now she’s all grown up!!!! Congrats on the engagement Kayla!!!!
Simsy I’m so happy for both of you! Happy happy days!
I am so happy for you guys! Fingers crossed he is with you by your birthday! Hugs!
CONGRATS!!! ✨
can i ask you something? When you and Dan first started talking and you wanted to visit him, did you involve your parents into it or kept them out? Me and my "hot date" have been talking for a few months and i live in Italy, he lives in the US, he says he'd rather not have a long distance relationship if it means never meeting one another but both he and I love each other very much and we both know that if we told our parents, they'd go ballistic. I don't feel like i'm getting scammed with him, but for my parents any long distance online relationship ends up like that and i don't want to let him go. What do you suggest?
Who else came to the comments before watching the entire thing to congratulate them????
Congrats Kayla~ I don't know why I'm feeling so much emotion from this news omg maybe it's from the fact that I've watched you since 2018 when you had like about 300K subs. I'm so happy for you!!
You are so sweet Kayla and you deserve so much happiness, congratulations!!!!
You guys look like brother and sister.....
Congrats, babe!! I'm so happy for you!
So... what’s fiancé. But feel like so cute and delightful. _edit: i found what fiancé means later though_
I have been wondering what was going on cuz I thought you announced your engagement on youtube wayyyyy earlier. I was wondering if you guys were still together
I hope everything works out to her liking. she is a smart and beautiful young woman. dan is a lucky man and he better treat her like the gem she is.
It’s the “...mark my words...” for me 😂
Congrats! I wish you both all the happiness to come to you!
ahh it sucks that you guys can't meet T.T Hopefully things get sorted out soon :(
i’m so happy for you kayla i cannot express how crazy this is i’ve been watching you for so long congrats
So happy for you Kayla. You and Dan deserve this and only happines ❤️❤️
After you and Dan get married at the courthouse, you should do a video where you create your dream wedding in the Sims 😍😍☺ Congrats to you two. I'm SO happy and excited for you guys to be reunited. What an amazing day. Best news ever 💗💗💗
Congratulation
Kayla: I have news  Twitch Stream Regulars: Yeah sure okay  But in all seriousness congratulations Kayla, from someone who follows you regularly I'm so happy for you and Dan that you finally have a light at the end of the dreadfully long tunnel that is this processes <3 Congratulations and best wishes for much happiness to come
I'm just curious. You said when he first arrives in the States, he can't work. Does that include Twitch?
Congratulations! I wish you the best of luck!
Yay!!! Congrats girl!! So happy for you
Kayla I’m sobbing

Congrats Kayla and Dan!!! I hope all this goes smoothly.
CAN I 😭 why is brazil banded I wanted to go to america
OOOHHHHH MY GOSHHHHH
Wait... when did you decide to get engaged? And was it in-person?
You have to have engagement photos and have a wedding before you age up! Is this the beginning of your new nightmare legacy challenge? Except not a nightmare. How about happily ever after Legacy challenge 😁
Congratulations! $2000 simoleons for love is money well-spent!
So when do we all start petitioning TLC for you? I feel like you have enough followers to get you on 90 day fiancé.
Didn’t even know you were engaged tbh
This is one of those videos I wish I could like repeatedly as if I was playing cookie clicker. 💗
Im coming to the wedding uninvited
I’m still saying WHAT halfway through the video
Yay congrats
my boyfriend is also from the uk and we can't see each other so i relate a lot
I’m not crying you are!!!!!!! Congratulations !!!!!
Kayla!! i’m SO happy for you, i feel emotional watching you talk about this crazy journey you’ve been on with Dan! i’m so happy things are finally looking up 🥺❤️❤️
i’m so so so happy for you.
Congrats! And agreed, the immigration process is A LOT. We had lawyers helping us, so it was more expensive, but smoother. Getting our green cards was an effing mess, though, because they were (and probably still are) getting through the backlog from after 9/11. So good luck to Dan on all of that stuff. And also, Congrats again! Fingers crossed that the rest of the process is smooth sailing.
I immigrated to australia from the Uk 2018 and applied for a partnership visa in 2019 to stay. Finally im 2021 i was approved! still have another few years before residency but I understand 100% the paperwork, legal jargon and the stress of the unkown! good luck to you two, i hope the travel restrictions ease with the rollout of more vaccines!! x
Yaasss girl sue the government! Total bs they weren't processing people's cases.
Thanks for sharing your story! I worked on immigration issues for people when I worked in a US Senate office and most people have no idea how terrible the process can be!
I am so happy for you.
thanks for sharing your life <3
yalls spawn gonna be 0 percent lip
Congratulations to you both 🎉 I feel like your my lucky charm because I found you last year when I really struggled mentally and being apart from my partner in Ireland (I’m in the UK) and then one of my housemates said they were gonna move out which meant he could move in! It will be around a similar time as Dan will hopefully be moving over 🤞🏻 I’m so excited for u!
Congratz!!!
I am so happy for the two of you!
Congratulations 🎉🍾!
Congratulations!!
You could make an engagement ring in the sims. A ring shaped house????????
Im hoping that the travel bans are lifted as well im supposed to be going to America in the summer.... :(
Congratulations!
First - congratulations!   But oh girl, I feel your pain on visa issues! The sheer expense is mind blowing - it always amazes me how people think you can just pack up your life and move - I WISH it was that easy! I’m now saving to put down my $2000 for my residency visa in New Zealand - I’ve easily paid over $1000 already for work visas and working holiday visas and editing those visas... I have to apply in November and then it’s back to my life being in the control of Immigration! I don’t think people realise either how much you cannot plan ANYTHING because you’re waiting on other people to say “Yep, you’re good!” I totally feel you! Can’t wait until the day I don’t have to worry about it. ❤️
OH MY GAWD!!!!! CONGRATS 💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛
i can’t wait for the day dan is in the video too :)
Congratulations!!🎈
Congratulations Kayla!
I'm so happy for you:DD <333
YAY CONGRATS GUYS!!
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU AND DAN!!!! You two are amazing!
CONGRATS!! ✨❤
I KNEW IT
AHHHHH CONGRATSSS!!!
Congrats! My friend had a lot of trouble with Visas when she married a man from another country. They were married for several months, but she was stuck here and told it could take up to two years.
That 90 day fiance took me tf out💀🤣
Kayla congratulations on yur engagement. Happy for yu guys.
Fick the imigration system of the us
take that, TikTok, this 12 year old is getting married
Congrats!!  A dear friend of mine went through this too a couple years back with trying to get her wife here to the US.  Happy to say, they're very happily hitched now, and hopefully things will go smoothly for you and Dan too!
wait.... what???????
I have a friend that married a Canadian, and he moved here to the US. This was a few years before the pandemic. It's a long, expensive process without the pandemic. I can't imagine what dealing with it right now. I don't know if it's because he's Canadian instead of from England, but I don't remember him not being allowed to work. I do remember the tons of paperwork they had to send in though, and of course the medical exam and interviews. Anyway, congrats! Hope the rest is smoother sailing for you both.
Congratulations. Hopefully the UK's path out of covid helps with the travel bans. $4000 is reasonably cheap. My partner visa in Australia was $8000 but we paid $12,000 AUD as we used an immigration lawyer. I waited 19 months for the first part of my visa and then 6 months for the second.
I am so extremely happy for you and Dan!!!!
Tomorrow is my 6 year anniversary for my partner and I and we also met on Twitch because he was modding in a friend's twitch stream! I swear the best relationships start on Twitch. Congratulations!
AGHHH IM SO HAPPY FORYOU! I too married a Brit! It’s the best!
WHATTTTTTTTTTT
congrats kayla and dan!
This is sooo exciting! Yay!! 😊
I need more details in that engagement story? It went from yeah we started dating to so now we’re trying to get married??? Like was it just discussed that they’d get married and no actual engagement?
Congratulaions!! 🤘
i love this for you :’)
I'm so happy for you!!! Congratulations 🎉❤️
Congratulations! :> I love your videos! Keep up the good work Kayla. You’re amazing, always remember that. <3
IM SO HAPPT FOR YOU 😄😄
im crying wtf
AWH
Kayla im genuinely sobbing right now!!!!! i remember watching you back when you were in high school and feeling like you were like a big sister who could guide me through difficult unknown stuff since youre a couple of years older, feeling like we had so much in common and how that made my days less lonely... im so proud of you and so happy for you!!! you deserve the world!!!!
Ahhh congrats. I'm sending you and your fiance all the positive vibes ❤️❤️❤️
My husband just got his green card after 2 years of waiting for it to process! Congrats on your news! It was so hard to wait for almost a year without hearing anything. Omg I totally get that feeling of having your future in someone elses hands. Going to the interview and knowing the lady you are looking at has your whole future in their hands.  We just have to get his citizenship in about 3 years..
👏🏼
Congratulations 🎉
I cried
I hate how long the visa takes. My husband is from Vietnam, but was already in the U.S. on a student visa turned OPT visa. We got married first since he was here already. Applied July 2018, received his work authorization February 2019, and his interview/approval July 2019! Takes FOREVER. The thing that sucks is that if you've been married for less than 2 years when apply for visa then the green card is only good for 2 years and you have to pay more money to have the condition taken off green card. But he can receive citizenship after 3 years on a green card. We just applied for his condition to be taken off and he can apply for citizenship July 2022! The initial application is the worst part (besides maybe the citizenship test), but rest is smooth sailing. Congratulations!!!
WHAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTT
How exciting!! Congratulations and good luck!
isn't Dan a streamer too? if he moves to the US he won't be able to stream for months?  edit to clarify: given that she said that he would not be allowed to work until his status is updated after their wedding
OMG Congrats!!!!!! :D
Congratulations Kayla and Dan! I am so happy for you guys that things are finally coming together and moving along! 🥰🥰🥰
I gotta be honest with you bestie....I knew that you were gonna get engaged before 2021 ended😌😌😌
DanTDM has kid
WHAAAAAAT CONGRATULATIONSSS
i am so excited and happy for you!!
I am glad for you kid wish you all the luck
Congratulations 🥺🥺🥺soooo excited for you 🎉🎉🎉❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations 🎉🎈🎊🍾
Am I the only one who didn’t know they were engaged? This isn’t an engagement announcement right??
Congratulations ❤🎉👏
Would it be just as hard to do the reverse... from America to england? Or move somewhere out of state to be with your partner... just wondering
I know it’s not actually too soon but this is too soon. 😭😭😭
Yass, it’s like you’re my kid because I’ve watched you for a long time  So proud 🤧😢
Congrats!!!!!
As someone who has been waiting months and months and months for the Canadian government to even acknowledge that they’ve received my application to sponsor my common-law husband to continue living with me, I feel both your pain and your relief. It was so exciting to finally have an application number.
Wait what? Congratulations!!! But... what? Am I the only one that didn't know about this?
moving to the us is so weird to me because... living in an eu country i could travel to, move to, or work in any other eu country without any problems
let's go bestiee
I was literally watching 90 Day Fiance when I opened YouTube and saw this. Lol.
And all of this is why my friend's friend just moved to the UK to marry his wife. She's been living in the US no issues since and their child has dual citizenship.
Yes we clicked immediately because we're very happy for you both! Congrats and cant wait to hear more good news 😊
This is exciting! If he has to go to another country, make sure he has a return trip to the UK even though he won’t use it. Someone on 90 day fiance did not and she ended up in detention and then being deported from Mexico.
Last time i was this early she was still 14.
This new season of 90 day fiancé looks great
WE'RE THE SAME AGE AND SHE'S SUCH A LOVELY GIRL AND IS GETTING MARRIED AND??1??1?1?1??? HOPE E V E R Y T H I N G WORKS AMAZING FOR THEM TAT  Edit: Also moving to the USA when the UK hss public health,,,,,,,,,,,, YEAH I DID LISTEN TO THE ANSWER SHE GAVE BUT DJWKBSJS
Get you a girl with the duality of playing video games for her career AND US immigration law deep diving for fun. Elle Woods 2.0
So excited for you guys!! I've been going through this process for about 5 years, had my green card interview right before quarantine started so I got really lucky in that regard, but I remember being super anxious because I didn't know if they were just gonna close things down and I'd be stuck or have to leave right when things were finally starting to reach the finish line. We had to cancel our wedding but thankfully had gotten married early in the courthouse due to the 90 day time limit
None of this is news to me (heyyyy twitch fam) but I am so proud of you, Simsie. You are an inspiration on so many levels. Keep up the awesome work 💛
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!!! YAYYYY CONGRATS!!!
omg kayla im so happy for you my dear
When he can’t get a visa bc he has an STD 😬
CONGRATSSS, GOD BLESSS 🙏🙏
Congratulations.  There are thousands of couples who have applied for K1 visa even back in 2019.  It's heart breaking and gut wrenching. So congratulations to you and Dan.
OMG 😱 congrats 🥳
Congratulations Kayla xx
Wait didn't we already know this
Congrats Kayla!! <33
Yay!!!! That’s so exciting!  Listening to you talk about everything and nothing every day has been really nice since the pandemic has started. Thanks for being here daily 💕💕
I'm very excited for you Kayla! Congrats on the news!
Aww im so happy
omg ummm  how this is so pog
Congratulations on your engagement
Congratulations!!!🎉
Me acting shocked at the title even though I knew already from the streams🤣 honestly congrats though❤️ I’m so happy for you guys finally getting some change in status!
Yesss! Congrats! This kind of scares me though since we’re the same age; I have a couple of friends who are getting married in August and like I’m so happy for them but also AAAAA THEYRE GETTING MARRIED YANNO?
Congratulations!!!
The description is so great lol Anyways congrats!
Congratulations to you both!!!!
This got me thinking.. my BF of 5 years is also from England and if this process is really so lengthy maybe we should just start that now before I graduate college lmao
AAAAAAAWWWEE🥺🥺KAYLA IS GONNA BE A LIL ANXIOUS BRIIIIIDE
OMG YAY! I'M THROWING A PARTY FOR YOU IN THE SIMS NOW
Congrats to you and Dan, Kayla. So happy and excited for you!
how is someone who is 12 getting married
Currently in the middle of this process too with my fiancé. Such a long process and it’s been a long year of not being able to have visits
CONGRATS GIRL!!!!!
Congratulations! If the travel ban is still going on in June/July, he could come to Canada for the quarantine time and then move down to Florida to you!
So happy for you guys!! I watch you on twitch so I've known for a while, but I'm so glad you have good news and something to look forward to now! 💕
Sirsly happy
This had better not be a late April Fool's.......
At the end of 2019, I flew to England bc a good friend of mine (American) was marrying a Brit. They had to go through all kinds of paperwork and stuff too, except in her case she was the one moving to the UK. I don't think they had a fiance visa, though. She told me they were technically legally married when she moved to England, but they weren't going to consider themselves "married" until their wedding celebration/her walking down the aisle on Jan. 4, 2020. Considering the pandemic started only just shortly after that, I think they were pretty lucky. I also have friends who've had pandemic weddings, whether at a courthouse or even with just five family members on a mountainside (and her photos were unbelievably lovely). I'm so glad it's working out for ya, Kayak! That's so exciting. 😊
Petition for Dan to take Kayla's last name, so they can be Mr and Mrs Sims
Congratulations!
YAY CONGRATS
I feeeeelll you on this. My husband and I are going through the green card process and it's soooo long
🤯🤯🤯🤯
this makes me so happy I'm gonna cry
!!!!!!!
Can't wait for you to recreate your wedding in the sims lmao
congrats! i can’t believe i’ve watched you grow up and now you’re gonna be married.
June 29th is my birthday-
AHHHHHHHH!!! CONGRATS KAYLA!!!!
SIMSIE SIMSE SIMSE YAYYYY
I’m so happy for you 🥺
Simply congratulations
WOAH CONGRATS!!!!!
Congrats!!!
KAYAK??! WHAT! CONGRATS
Congratulations!!! I feel like I've grown up with you and I can't wait to see you get married!!
Me: Oh, she's going a new sim challenge that I haven't heard of. This would be interesting.  A 90 day's sims challenge." I click the video and she's engaged! I was shocked, "Congrats!" :)
I seen you from you were in high school, you’re growing so fast, but I’m more than extremely happy to see that you’re doing so well in life and you love what you’re doing with YouTube!
Got to love Wastemonster.  In case you didn't notice my sarcasm there, I am being sarcastic.  Our government are pants!  I hope you get it all sorted so you and Dan can be together soon Kayla.  I could not imagine being apart from my partner for so long and being across the pond.  We're in Scotland.   There is something we do here in Scotland, which I'm sure because we're still part of the UK, that you and Dan could do.  Have you ever heard of handfasting?  In ancient times in Scotland we had handfasting with a threefold cord, usually with the male's tartan and the female's tartan and you were declared married for 1 year and 1 day and if no offspring was produced, the female had the choice to ditch the guy and find someone else - yeah different times.  But we still have the handfasting part of it, just not the timeframe on it.  It's not a legal declaration of love, but it is beautiful :) Just a thought ;) Come over when travel bans lift and do it.  Take pictures - you would be married in our eyes in Scotland because you are handfasted.   You got any Scottish Ancestry?  Has Dan?
Congratulations! :)
this is so so exciting! my partner and i are in the process of getting him to the US right now too. we're still waiting on an interview date, but we're super hopeful since he's coming from New Zealand. it's been so so exciting but also incredibly stressful, so i get where you're coming from! i hope the process goes quickly from here for you guys. congrats!
wait i'm confused... are they actually engaged?
Congrats, I’m so happy for you!
I love how easy Americans think visas are! My husband is American and trying to get him visa every six years (still doesn't qualify for a permanent one in my country) is a nighmare!!!   Anyway congratulations!
His interview is on my birthday 🎉. All the best to you guys
What what what I missed so much congratulations 🥳❤️
I have a question: how do you make a long-distance relationship work? I'm asking this because I met a really cool person online and I want to ask her out (long distance) but she lives in a different country and I'm willing to try an LDR but I don't know if she is and AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
You've probably already seen this, but they seem to be changing travel regulations as of today, at least a bit, especially if he's able to get his covid vaccine shots before then.
I'm so happy for u two seriously!!! All this time you guys wait for this day aaaaa CONGRATS
BYE MY JAW DROPPED OKKK KAYAK
girl your camera is bussin
WOOOW congratulations !! I'm so happy for you
Congrats! This all sounds so exciting! Hopefully this complicated, paperwork-ridden nightmare works out with as few hiccups as possible! 😓
CONGRATS WOW
wena compañera, un gusto verte kreser un avraso de chile
I was so worried it would be an April’s fool joke lol  You guys are meant to be, I’m really happy for you! ❤️❤️
CONGRATULATIONS
Almost married and still didn’t find Pietro!
Congrats to you two. All the best for the future.
YAYYY CONGRATS
Yesssssssss! So so thrilled for you!  The government having control over something important in your life part. Whew! I felt that in my soul. My husband and I adopted all three of our kids through foster care. It took forever, and there were so many bumps and waiting moments. Our two oldest were even gone from us for 8 months. We had no idea if we’d ever see them again. It was horrific. So, I get it. I’m sorry you’re dealing with government red tape, but I am also so glad you’re coming towards the end of it soon! ❤️
I am so happy for you!!! Wishing both of you the best!
brazil being banned me: lives in brazil ✨ thanks mr president you SUCK ✨
This was truly quite interesting. Definitely happy for you both! 💛
kayla, i’m so proud and happy for you!!!
Congrats $imsie!!! So happy for you
HOW CAN WE SEND YOU WEDDING GIFTS
Me and my boyfriend are in the process of getting a K1 Visa too

thank you for not posting this yesterday... but congrats!!!
Congratulations!
AHHHHHHHHH OH MY GOD CONGRATS CONGRATS CONGRATS!!!
CONGRATULATIONS KAYLAAAA !!!!
who is downvoting this???
Bunk beds work now!!!! With desks and toddler beds and toys etc. under
So there's this other YouTuber that I watch who, like Dan, moved to the US from the back UK to marry his wife, and he talks about the process, and makes videos about the US vs the UK in various ways. He's called Lost in the Pond. Maybe you'd be interested
😌
I am pleased. Congrats. And as I the only one who did t know they were engaged?!?!? 🙋‍♀️🤷‍♀️ Stupid 2020.
So I'm 4 years older than you but I've been watching your channel since 2015. So we both were just KIDS. Now fast forward Im a mom now, have a fiance and own my first home. Now you are engaged!!!  What glow ups 🥺❤️
So excited for you guys!!!
WHAT OMG CONGRATULATIONS
Kayla, you need to recreate your wedding on the sims after you get married!!
I mean, she's not wrong. I saw "I'm engaged" for the title, thought "oh, congrats" and clicked then learned how complicated immigration to the US can be when you're planning on marrying a US citizen.
congrats!
OMG!!!!!!!! CONGRATS!!!!!!
i moved here from iran in 2016 finally after FOURTEEN YEARS OF WAITING
CONGRATS KAYAK!!!
i went through this process with my husband. It took forever, i got to skip the k1 visa since i was here in usa on student f1 ( Canadian). Adjusted my status in 2016 after court wedding. Then got my green card 9 months from that date in nyc ( got the interview). Moved to seattle from nyc I had to apply for the removal of condition of green card which was filed a year and half after the conditional green card. ( file early since delay is long) got it barely before the conditional green card almost expired. Some people will be asked to come in for another interview but i got to skip ( probably because first one went well)  Then applied to naturalize this took so long for Seattle field office. for me it took a year and half... so finally 2021 jan i became dual citizen. During this time lol i had 3 pregnancies 2 ended in miscarriages but I honestly thought baby was going to be here before my final interview. I went to the interview 19 week pregnant at the time ! finally done with the immigration journey LOL just got my American passport not long ago because that takes a while to get too. I been living in usa legally since 2010 lol. Good luck! the journey will be long but wroth it .
make him go to turkey its much cheaper then you think
This is so exciting! I am so happy for you!
How does Kayak, a 14 year old, get engaged?
Good on you!
Why does it make me so happy to know and see that Kayla is so happy and is getting married? I've never met her, and likely won't ever meet her,  but I still feel like a proud older sister!!!
So Kayla - it sounds like you and Dan are doing a 14 day vacation in Mexico? Lol
Omg Kayak is engaged, let's gooooo
My parents are trying to become citizens through my older brother who turned 21. Its been like 3 years😅 I just wanna be able to go on a trip to Mexico with my family, that's probably my biggest dream. And its SOOO close, my parents have come a long way and I think they really deserve to have this. It would also be nice for my parents to meet their parents after like 22 years.
Kaylaaaaa I'm so happy for you! Congrats!
Congrats
K-1 fiancée visa process is pretty tough, it took us 6 months, we were lucky to go through the process so fast compared to other people, it was back in 2016 though. Can’t imagine how long people need to wait now...very unfortunate.
Girl !!!!! I am SO happy for you guys
i literally had to do a project for one of my class's to research and learn about the K-1 visa process YESTERDAY this is so funny...now i feel so smart watching this...
YESTERDAY WAS MY BIRTHDAY AND I GOT PROPOSED TO AS WELL!!!! AAHAHAHAHHHH
I didn’t know your were engaged, congratulations!
The interview is on my birthday. Wishing y’all the best of luck! 🤞🏽
Awwww. Congrats Kayla! Hopefully everything works out for you.
It makes me so happy to see young people getting engaged and getting married and not letting judgement stop them from living their lives the way THEY want to, and not the way anyone tells them to  Congratulations Kayla and Dan, I’m so so so happy for you two!!!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
I hope that everything goes well!!!!, now in march 2021 my country (Chile) finally closes officially the airports because we are in the worst situation since started the pandemic and we are one of the countries with the most vaccinations 🥲🥲 well what can i say??? The current government is shit. But from the bottom of my heart i hope everything goes well for you guys so happy for you lilsimsie ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is the only engagement video I've watched that exhausted me lmao if only more people could understand immigration is not as easy as it seems.
Omg congrats 😭😭😭💖💖
Ahhh congratulations!!!!
OMG CONGRATS!!!
i know he loves you because he's willing to give up universal healthcare lmao
watching this to learn when i move to Ireland and married Kevin
@lilsimsie I am so happy for you both! Sending love and hugs your way!
I still remember that you talked about bullies in your high school and how busy in the college. I cannot believe you are engaged lol. I feel like that my younger cousin is getting engaged lol
At least she finished the 100 baby challenge before this 🙏🤩
Ahhh wow so much love and excitement for you
You could apply to siblings or dating
glad someone's talking about how damn expensive it is to move to a different country. we have family from mexico that came here with basically nothing and then had to work for nothing to save up for the entire process. you're super fortunate to be able to pay for this as easily as you could! well wishes to you and dan, congrats on being engaged and moving forward on the same path!
Why I’m single jk I’m fucking sad
congratulations!! omg
Congrats! 🥳🥳🥳
OH MY GOD
Sure that’s legal, kayak aren’t you 14? 😌✨
Imagine this video was posted on april fools day
OH MY GODDDDDD
Omg congrats!
Here comes the bride
Ladies, quit comparing yourselves to Kayla. We all go at our own pace and if we work hard (no matter age) we will get there someday as well.... Also, remember when Dan was just her video editor? Now look at them 😍😍
CONGRATS KAYLA😭😭
First of all: congrats!! I know exactly how you feel! We're not in the US, but my husband and I got married in December 2019 a bit before his regular tourist visa ran out. In Austria you apparently have to get married first before applying for the visa. So we did get married and then he had to go back to Japan - and we waited for the visa. But then COVID hit us in March (it usually takes 3-6 months they said) and he didn't get to come back until July, which actually was a nightmare because people weren't allowed to actively travel. So while he had the visa and from Austrian side he was allowed to come, the Japanese airline didn't want to let him out of the country because they were scared he could end up stranded on the airport or something... Cue to me, trying to reach *someone* from the government, airport, or something similar, to get an "okay" that the Japanese airline requested, two hours before take-off. The stress I can't tell you... But now he's here and all is well and I am sure it will be fine for you, too! Good luck and fingers crossed the travel goes over smoothly!
Isn’t she like 16 ?!
Omg congratulations Kayla!!!!! I know the struggles with US immigration :P So happy for you and Dan :)
She started when she was in high school,she graduated,her sister once mocked in hee video about her future boyfriend,she started college,she finished college,SHE IS ENGAGED(i am still processing). What is next? Marriage? A child, second one? What is future? What is now? What was past? What are we living? What is the meaning of life? Will we see her funeral 70 years later from her children in a video? These are the questions i have.
The interview at the Us embassy in London will probably take about 6 hours for literally a 5 minute conversation.  I had this for when I applied for a C1D visa. Couldn't take a bag in with any food or drink, but you can buy food and drink inside.  I suspect a similar activity for Dan.  Congratulations 👏
congrats! so happy for y'all!
Yayyy so happy for u
OMG congratulations!!!! That is amazing!!!! I cannot believe it!!!
This comment is probably going to get lost but! My husband got his approval the same day of the interview and his visa came in about a week. We did a courthouse “wedding” and had our actual wedding a year later. I’m so excited for you!!!! Ahhhh!!!!!!
This is so exciting for you guys! I’m so happy for you two!
Simsie’s mind: Visa and Pietro
When I tell you my mouth dropped... Also your fiance (ooo) is getting interviewed on my birthday
Congratulations!
OHHHHHH NOW I KNOW WHY you didn’t want to post on April fools day, the title BUT OMG CONGRATS <3
CONGRATULATIONS!!! So happy for you too ❤️❤️
Isn't turkey not in europe? 😉
KAYLAAAAA OMG
CONGRATS!!! That’s crazy. I have been watching you for so many years, it’s like I have grown up with you and it’s just crazy to think you are engaged now!! I’m soooo happy for you!!
guys how old is she
Very excited for you! Thank you for being vocal and educational about this. Not many people know how lengthy the process is! I recently just adjusted my status and everything was nervewracking but it worked out in the end!
I realized i am growing up...
Wait, will Dan have to stop streaming for 6-9months once he's entered the US?
I'm curious - in theory, if you moved to the UK could you still make youtube? Or would that violate the work permit thing?
💞💖👑💖💞
CONGRATS ❤️❤️❤️ IM SO PROUD IM LITERALLY CRYING 😭😭❤️❤️❤️
CONGRATULATIONS 🥺♥️
Out of topic but istg her skin’s glowing rn, u glow different when you’re in love I guess 😔 congrats!
KAYLA IS ENGAGED?!!! CONGRATULATIONS BTW ♥️ but how did we get here ?! Did we grow up already. I’m old now and going off to university and Kayla is getting married ....  I remember the Susan days 😭✨
Are you sure about this Kayla, you do know that your committing too be with this little son of a- I mean gentlemen until death, do you want too be with him...FOREVER, you can’t date anybody ever again and divorces are not free... am sorry I just don’t want too see you leave yet😞
praying he doesn’t have active tuberculosis or gonorrhea 🤞🤞
Why am I crying in the club rn I'm so happy for you both ahhh thats so exciting !!!
Hats off to Dan for getting a 40 minutes excited ramble down to a comprehensive but still very excited 15 minutes
Kayak’s been busy
This is such big news Kayla!! Congratulations!! Even though it won’t be the “ideal” wedding but it’ll be yours, and it’ll be so special! I’m beyond happy for you both ❤️
YAYY finally ❤️ so happy for you
Congrats 😊🥳
Gave a like before Kayla could even finish the word news. So happy that things are finally happening!
Ahhhhh
YAY IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
I AM SO HAPPY YAY
Ahhh I’m so happy for you! I wish you both the best ❤️
congrats!🎈🎉🎊🍾
congratulations!!!!! i’m so happy for you guys :)
Congrats!
I am crying
Congratulations on the forward movement! I'm so happy for you guys!
Congratulations Kayla! I'm so genuinely happy for you
Oh my goodness I'm so happy for you, finally it's all happening 💖  congratulations Kayla it's so exciting.
you're engaged??? omg congrats
Congrats! I came to the states back in 1999 on a K1 visa. Still married to my hubby 21 yrs later :)
The biometrics fee confuse me highly loool good luck Dan, and hope everything works out !!! Such exciting news
I can't believe that they didn't put a hold on people's visas during the travel ban! That's ridiculous! OF COURSE they didn't use them! 😡
Congratulations!!! 🍾🥂🍾
GIRL WHAT! YOU ARE SO POG
Congrats you guys! 🎉💍❤️
Congrats! My boyfriend lives in The Netherlands and I'm in the USA. We have been together 12 years and have not even started the visa process. It will be a while before we do. I own my home and have cats and fish. He lives with his parents but they are elderly and he takes care of them and handles their finances. It is just impossible to be together right now. I am so happy for you and Dan! This is a dream come true, I am sure. Hugs!
SIMSIE!!! CONGRATS!!! It's crazy to think that I and so many other folks have been watching you since high school (it was nice to have someone who could relate to AP test stress and weird passive aggressive bullying from susans lol) and now you're getting MARRIED!! Best wishes for you and Duck Dan! Hopefully the rest of your visa process is as smooth as possible after all this mess! Also, video idea: a classic, Huntley's-era style lets play episode where you and dan get married in the sims, screenshot showcase included.
Congrats!! I'm genuinely so happy for you!
Eeeeeee!
Imagine how weird it must be to edit the video of your fiancee discussing the process of getting you a visa
I am currently waiting for my husband's interview! Hopefully they will schedule soon! 💙
Thank you for sharing this experience. I find it fascinating. Also congrats on everything!
My partner and I are also a UK/US couple (they're in the UK and I'm in the US). Once we have been together for longer I will either apply for a work visa to live with/near them, or we're gonna get the fiance visa. I've been obsessed with how to move to the UK for months, and it's interesting hearing the other side.
Congrats Kayla! 🎊🙌🏾 You and Dan's love, commitment and strength gives me hope in finding my Mrs right. 😩🥰Hope the visa process goes smoothly and quickly for you guys! 💜
We do the testing for 2 immigration offices at the lab I work at. It always amused me that we will get accessions just for syphilis and TB in our department.
OMG CONGRATULATIOOOOOONS!!!!!
congratulations kayla! 90 Day fiancé sims version 🤣❤️
I’m so happy for you !!!
this is sooooo relatable. i’m married to a Japanese person and we currently live outside of Tokyo. but I’m moving back to the States soon and we will probably be apart for two years until he can come. we decided we would eventually move to the States before we got married (2 years ago) but we just didn’t know exactly when. I have been reading all about the immigration process and it is insane. not looking forward to it at all.  anyway, congrats on your engagement and for now having some light at the end of the tunnel! i hope everything works out well for you guys!
Congrats!
I've never clicked that fast. Congrats Kayak ! Wishing both of you the best. Can't believe how fast our favorite 12 y-o grew up.  Damn, suing the US government, that's iconic.
Congratulations
I'm so happy for you🥺
SORRY WHAT???!!!??? Omg congratulations 😭😭
CONGRATULATIONS 🍾 🥂
Congratulations Kayla! I'm really happy for you! I hope it all goes well and Dan can get here quickly! Good luck with everything that still has to happen. I know how slow and annoying the government can be, I had to go through lots of hoops early last year. The only question I've got is this: is anyone planning to change names? You're kind of a little bit known for the fact that your last name is Sims and you play the Sims! Will he take yours? You take his? Mix them together? Neither change?
Congrats!
Kalay your part is not straight
kayla should do vlogs or something, it would be pretty entertaining
Oh I feel so bad for you but at least there is news and it is moving forward... as slow as it is. I completely understand that you want the wedding with family and everyone around but also still wanting to get married as soon as you can! I got married in last October with 15 friends and family there and we are doing a big do in November hopefully with everyone there!! I wish you all the luck!! And congratulations 😊✨🌱
Eeeeeeek! I’m so excited!
Oh my god Kayla congrats I’m so happy for you!!
Omg I’ve literally been watching 90 day fiancé a lot recently and was thinking “why doesn’t Kayla just get the k-1”. That’s crazy!
Congratulations girl❤❤❤❤
"some COUNTRIES are banned like EUROPE, Brazil and China"...  oh no
What a lucky ass guy. He's a good man to realize how lucky he is to have you as his lover and bestfriend 💕
they grow up so fast🥺 congrats Kayla and Dan!
👏👏👏👏👏👏
Congratulation Kayla!  I am glad that things are moving forward for you and Dan.  I went through almost the same process as you when I got married,  you just have one extra step (and a pandemic) that I did not have to deal with.  It is indeed a long process and very expensive.  But you will get there. Take it in strides and celebrate each step forward. There is need to rush to the "wedding day", and please do not feel pressure by your family, and certainly not social media comments, to do things quickly.  Marrying someone from a different country is an exhausting process.  Give yourselves time to enjoy each other, you will already be legally married in court anyway for the process to continue, and when you are both rejuvenated THEN throw the celebrations! Best wishes!
I've watch kayla growing up and now she's all grown up
If he does need to quarantine in another country one of those is the Dominican Republic. We went on vacation last month and there was a couple there (she was from the UK, he was from USA) that was engaged and she was moving to the USA. So they basically just took a 2 week vacation and then she moved with him after that 2 weeks. It would be cool to do I think for you both if you were up to it.
zmeohfishdjshdbeidbeb KAYLA IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
Congrats!
i get the feeling honestly- my life is a constant visa and ive lived in three different countries in the last year i'll be soon moving to another one
Me wondering why brazil is banned just because we have a completely crazy and irresponsible and genocidal president and an alienated population 🤔
congrats kayla!
Aaaa!!! So happy for you!!!
Congrats ❤️
Since he isn’t allowed to work once he moves will he still be able to twitch stream since it makes him income?
WHEN I TELL YOU I GASPED AND SCREAMED AAHHHHHHHH KAYLAAAA
Congrats my love, i hope it all goes to plan. Lots of love🤎
OH MY GOD YEAAAAAAAHHH THATS AWESOME IM SO EXCITED FOR YOUUUUUUUU
OMG IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU KAYLA
🎊🎉 congratulations. I'm so excited for you❤
PLSSS NOT ME THINKING HER FIANCE WAS PHILZA
Congrats!!!!!
Congratulations, Kayla!! And Dan!! My brother just went through this process the year before Covid. His original wedding date was to be in August of 2019 but due to visa delays it had to be postponed and then came through two days before the original date. They also did a courthouse wedding but managed a big bash with family and friends February of 2020!! Seriously just under the wire! My family came home to Canada and went into lockdown, it was crazy! I hope it is all smooth sailing for you from here on in! Love your videos and your enthusiasm. Can’t wait to see your tearful, happy vid when he finally gets here. Happy Simming!  - Hey just an idea, Sims wedding while you await the real big day? What would your dream wedding be??
I am so happy for you two!!!!! ALLLLLL the best wishes ❤️
Omg yasss congratulations ❤❤
omg Kayla congrats. I’ve watched your videos for quite a while and I am happy for you.
I’m never commenting under your videos.. but this is too pure 🥺 Congratulations Kayla <3 Keep on your great work !!
I understand what you have been through as me and my family just moved to Australia and it was  so much work, effort and time. And i wanted to say that even if  the travel ban isnt restricted and the 6 months have ended i think they will extend the period as that is exactly what happened to us. We had one year and that year ended in october so when the month passed they extended our period of entry so hopefully that will happen to you
Congratulations! My granddad finally got his US citizenship a few months back despite being married to his wife for like 10 years and living with her in Hawaii for even longer. I didn't realise as a kid how many hoops he must have gone through.
Time flies
I am really really happy for you two and I wish you all good. Take care :* <3
I watch your YouTube and sometimes your twitch. I don’t know a whole lot about your personal life but I’m really happy for you guys. 😊
I’m so happy for u Kayla! I’ve been a fan for about 2 years now and I just wanna tell u how much I appreciate ur videos, wishing u and Dan happiness!
I’m so happy for you!!! Congratulations 🥺
This is crazy. I've been watching you since you were in high school and now you're getting married! I'm so happy for you! Obviously you deserve your privacy but it's crazy to think that you've been engaged this whole time and we didn't know.
*Twitch people knowing for a year*
I can't wait to see him pop up behind your streams on a regular basis
why am i so invested in this
Kayla better have a marquise cut because you know, it looks like a plumbob
my reaction: WHAT. *click* Congratulations, Kayla!
Congratulations!!
Congratz! Much LOVE from Oklahoma!
My husband and I are both English and live in the US!! We’ve been here for 3 years and got our green cards 2 years ago. Good luck with the next part of the process!!!

KAYLA I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU <3
CONGRATULATIONS
Omg congratulations👏👏👏
Record your wedding 👰
Congrats!!
CONGRATULATIONS
Congrats, Kayla!🥳
Congratulations
Congratulations on finally getting the paperwork moving along!  I was once the European coming to the US, and it was a long and tedious, and so frustrating, process, mostly because my husband was in the army and when he would be deployed, he wouldn't be able to keep up with the paperwork, and it made the process even longer. This was a while ago, we've been married 22 years now, but I still remember that feeling you describe, moving to another country, and not being in charge of anything, and even worse, some stranger being in charge of whether or not you get the approval to be with the one you love. So glad to hear that it's happening for you guys. I wish you both all the best!
This seems like such a hectic process so I'm so glad that it's almost over for you guys ❤️
SO HAPPY FOR YOU BOTH KAYLA!!!!! LOL WE’RE GOING TO HAVE A SIMS WEDDING 🤣
Kayak could make videos abt visa and wedding stuff tbh, I would watch it all
omg congrats & good luck you guys ♥️♥️
What I don’t understand is why y’all are trying to have him move here rather than you move there....
I AUDIBLY SCREAMED
OMG congrats!
IM SO HAPOY FOR YOU!
I looked if it wasn't April's Fools because I didn't want it to be a joke
okay so turkey isn't europe anymore?
Congrats Simsie!!! Wishing you and Dan the best 💖
i can't believe they let kayak, a 12 year old, get engaged
oh my god im so proud🥺❤️
I'm so happy for you! You got your date. Hope everything moves easier and quicker for you guys. Best of luck.
"ah just another april fools joke... WAIT ITS APRIL 2ND" -my exact thought process seeing this notification
Thank you so much for explaining this process. Wayyyy too many people don't realize just how complicated immigration is.
i hope it all works out for you two congrats!!!
Fiancé??? Gurl what?? I remember watching you when you were in high school and now you are engaged what? But in all seriousness I hope youu two are very happy for a long time. Best wishes x
Congrats!! 🎊🎉 were so happy for you!! 😃😃
Even though a lot still needs to happen, I’m so happy for you guys that things are progressing and there is a light at the end of the tunnel 🥺💙💙
Small weddings are the best!! Congratulations 👏
you’re twelve you’re not old enough 😭
CONGRATZ KAYLAAAAA
Aaaaaah!!! Snap is gonna be so happy!!!!
From a fellow "met someone online, moved country to be with them* and got married at 21" person, congratulations! I hope that everything goes smoothly from here on out and that you get to see Dan again really soon cause distance is absolutely the worst.  *(although mine was Ireland to the UK so not as complicated as the whole visa thing, you have my sympathy for that!)
AHHH OMG this makes me so happy ❤️❤️
i clicked so fast
Congrats ❤️
!!!!!! Amazing
Me who’s in a LDR hmmmmmm
I totally thought this was an April fools video
AHHHHHHHH CONGRATS
FIANCEE! Congratulations!!!!!!
Congrats
I know how you feel. I sponsored my Boyfriend at the time, so he could stay in Australia. It would have been faster to process a K1 Visa, but I was 17 turning 18 at the time. Not exactly ready for marriage...We waited about 3 years until we finally got the confirmation that he was a permanent resident. By that time we were already engaged..How frustrating..But, yeah, the government doesn't make it feel very romantic do they?😂😂
🎉
Many years ago a friend had to go through a similar process to prove that yes, he and his fiancee really loved each other and she wasn't just using him to get US citizenship (she was here as an au pair from, I think, Tonga). It's really a long and expensive process. Congratulations on your engagement; I lost my husband last year after 29 years of marriage (we'd just celebrated our anniversary 6 days before he died) and I can tell you that marriage isn't easy, but it's (mostly) worth it. ;-)
It's cute but also sad that she thinks we care more about her sims content than we do about her🥺
AHHH!😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Marrying doesn't mean they'll plan for kids already. We don't actually know if they want one. They can marry yet has to wait before going full until both of them are mentally and financially ready.
STOP.... YOU’RE GETTING MARRIED?? SHUT UPPPPPP
She looks way too young to be engaged! 😱 She looks 15!
I was just thinking about how sucky limbo is (pandemic, infertility, foster care system for me) and I know your situation is much different, but it's nice to hear about someone else going through limbo too.  Also squee! So happy for you!
Congratulations Kayla! I hope you both can be together soon x
Congratulations! So happy for you two for so many reasons!
you SUED the government?  between this and the cowplant naming thing, your power is off the shits
YAAAAAAY
I'm so happy for you guys!! But also thank you for sharing and talking about this!! My girlfriend and I are long distance and also trying to live together and so many people have so much misinformation about moving countries. Sending love to you guys!! 💕
How long does the visa last
I actually started doing the math, if where you live it was still the 1st of April. I guess it isn't, so congratulations!!❤
Me: “oh another episode of 90 day fiancé” *sees Kayla* “WTF KAYLA?!?!”
Congrats!!!! Hope you have a good engagement!!!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉
YOU GUYS ARE OFFICIALLY MY PARENTS IM DONEEE!!!
You gave a better explanation than people who have actually gotten visas, I’ve watch a bunch of videos just trying to get the jest of it so when it comes time for me and my bf to apply I understand it
Ccongratulations!  went through that process back in the 70s when I moved here with my British husband. Even though we were married already, my Mom had to sponser him and all the medical stuff was required. I am thrilled for you!
damn that's an insane process, I had no idea. Congrats though on getting some movement on it, and thanks for the explanation, it totally made sense and was pretty interesting too <3
Congrats!! ❤️
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
This was genuinely really helpful information, actually.
So exciting Kayal!! I hope it’s smooth sailing from here!! Wishing you all the best!!
CONGRATS 🎉
Wait, why couldn’t Dan move to the US just as an emigrant?
Congratulations! I'm so happy and excited for you. I hope everything go smoothly from here ❤️
Congratulations!!
im so proud of u kayak <3
This is happening to my best friend right now. She was even part of this lawsuit. Her fiance will finally be coming to the US in two months. He's from England too. Congrats to you and Dan!
This is amazing!
Kayla is getting married and me, a soon to be 25 year old has just discovered the fun of Minecraft 🤣
Very excited for you!
omg i would love to see a series of kayla & dan reacting to episodes of 90 day fiancée or something
OMG
I can’t wait for her sims inspired engagement photos 😂 congrats Kayla!
YESSSS SO HAPPY FOR YOU KEEP SUEING
Congrats Kayla!!!!!
14 feels a little young to be engaged...
I've been with my boyfriend for 2 1/2 years and it's long distance too! So happy for you
CONGRATULATIONS OMG. Great news about Dan and the Visa 💕
damn I think moving to Heaven is easier than moving to the US..
congratulations!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations Kayla and Dan! Xx
omg simsie <3  Im crying, i cant believe i watched you grow up and eventually engaged. I wish the best for you!
So glad this is finally happening for you all. Congrats and enjoy knowing that soon you will be back together. ❤️
Congratulations!
Congrats!!!! I went through this process pre-COVID with my husband and it still took us around 3 years to complete.  So I can imagine how excited you are :)  Even though it is incredibly scary now, you will both laugh about this one day.  Just stick in there!
Yay!!!
Tiktok: hmmm nope I still think you’re 12
Simsie suing the Government is the biggest mood
I knew it when I got my comment deleted in your twitch chat when I said K1 visas were for engaged people lol
So happy for you! Can't wait for the resolution to this long process. I'd be a freaken mess
I'm so happy for you two. That finally you have updates and that you will see eachother soonish.
I'm so exited for her!
Im just happy this wasn't an April fools joke 😂
I wonder if it would have been easier to just get married in a courthouse without applying for a visa, like a year ago
I’m so happy for you! I didn’t even know you had a BF! 😂
Im so so sooo happy for you guys💕
Anyone going to congratulate her
So Kayla is 4 days older than me and is engaged and I’m out here in a relationship with my dog
Congratulations sweetheart
AHHHHHH YAY OH MY GOD!!! I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU AND DAN!!! 💗💗💗
Congratulations
Yayayayayayay
CONGRATSSSSSSSSSSSSS
🇨🇦 here, If there are still travel bans once he has the Visa; Have him fly to Toronto & quarantine, then fly down to Florida.  Direct flight from Heathrow to Pearson is 5-6 hrs, the airport has a myriad of hotels in the vicinity where he can quarantine, and CAD is cheaper than both USD & GBP by decent amount. (As of today, $1 CAD = $1.26 USD/1.74 GBP)  Direct flight Toronto to Florida is 4 hrs, then he'll finally be home! Congratulations!!
So so so so SOOOOOO HAPPY for you Kayla and Dan. I hope to see you together soon. Much love
Lilsimsie casually telling us about her engagement✋ why is everyone growing up and shit and i am sitting here like.. i need another cup of choccie milk
KAYLA!!!! OMG so happy for you :)
The visa stuff is totally interesting--you hear about it from things like 90 day fiance but I've never heard the process from someone whose gone through it and DURING A PANDEMIC and had to SUE THE GOVERNMENT to get processed so yeah, you've got a unique story there.
Omg that’s my 18th birthday it better be a great day for you and I 💖✨
CONGRATS  AND CONGRATS ON WINNING THE LAWSUIT AND GETTING THE INTERVIEW DATE
i feel like i watched uu grow up o: congrats <3
Kayla and Dan, congratulations! :D

CONGRATS!!!!
congratulations queen, sending love always🤍
I have never clicked on one of Simsies videos so fast!!!!!
WAIT WHAT OMGGG I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU
Congratulations, Kayla!  P.s. I always knew that 90 day fiance show wasn’t like how it really is. I really only watch it when someone on YouTube talks about it and how ridiculous it is. I miss the days when TLC had quality over quantity shows.
Congratulations!!!!!! 🥳
Congratulations Kayla! I'm so happy for you!
yeeeees good for youuu! exciting! (And interesting)
My mom went through this same stuff in Canada and it is very similarly painful and long. I feel you. I'm so happy for you that things are moving. Also: "It's just very bizzare to have that big of a life change be completely out of your control", is me waiting for access to top surgery going through formalities and therapy rn. That one hits home. And the name change too.
Congratulations on finally getting together and getting married! Yeah I've heard from others how long it takes and money ! Hang in there!  I'm excited for you guys!
KAYLA!! 🥺 Im so happy for you both
Im crying
Awesome Kayla!
I'm so happy for you!
OH MY GOODNESS CONGRATS
Congrats💌📬
It's so nice to know someone else going through it too girl! I have felt like I've got no one else to talk to about it so this has been nice-I actually messaged asking on twitter and you responded and it's nice to have more insight into the process. My life has been so much in limbo I've even been in air bnbs hoping for covid to end so I could have my fiancé up here to help find a place to settle while I wait for k1- but I'm having to do evetyrhing alone and it's all been daunting or scary. So thank you so much for putting this out there ☺️
How about Canada to quarantine...not Mexico??  You are very lucky Biden is in charge...and boo hoo to Gov DeSantis is a jerk.  If anything upsets it...you can change states..Gov Inslee is great to his citizens.
It's scary how much effort it takes just for two people to be togehter. I am so impressed by how you two are handling it and how persistent and commited you are, I love you guys so much, it's so good to see you happy and excited about it 💗💗💗
they should have continued to process the visas and then when the ban lifts theyd have a huge amount of them ready they could all drop them at once
Congrats!! I also somehow got unsubscribed to you? So strange.
Eeeeeee congrats Kayla. ❤️❤️😭😭
Congrats!!!!!
Soooo uuuh... I remember starting to watch since Kayla was in her last year of school and now she's engaged? Sorry brb I'm gonna cry, I feel old.
ok thank u so much for this video, my fiance and i are in the middle of the k1 visa process im in canada, hes in us. we are almost there. I applied around the same time you guys did.
I can’t believe that a 14 year old girl can get married!!! Also NO BOYFRIENDS BEFORE MARRIAGE!!!!!!!! I’m so happy for you kayak
omg congrats!
Never thought I’d hear Lilsimsie say “Syphilis and Gonorrhea”
I'm happy for you. I know how it feels, my boyfriend is from the US, haven't seen him for over a year too and I'm from Brazil AND I didn't know about this visa so THANK YOU SO MUCH SIMSIE ❤️ I texted him yelling about it lol  Good luck to both of you hope everything works out 💜
YAAAAAAAAS, finally some good news! Oh, I hope everything goes well ☺️
The stress I experienced trying to get my cousin over to visit for 3 months (precovid) was stressful enough and that was a 2 month process because the first application was denied so we had to go another visa type which was successful in the end......so, I cannot imagine how stressful this process would have been for you. I’m so glad Dan will be joining you shortly. 💖💖
i was just jamming to “i love you jesus” and now i’m crying about this video. congratulations!!!
I feel like crying  I met kayla in the beginning of the pandemic and seeing her so excited makes me so happy, like for real. CONGRATS KAYLA <3
Congrats, Kayla!
I am so excited for you!!
yayy simsie i’m so happy for you! :)
so... am I invited to the wedding?Even if you put me on google meet :}     Full seriousness congratulations.
Congratulations! Hope things go well from here on out
I'm originally from Canada and moved to the US, so my husband and I went through this, or at least a similar process. If you have any questions, I can try to help.
Congrats ❤

Will you vlog your courthouse wedding!? Alexasunshine83 did that last year and it was so sweet to be there when her family couldn’t.
I'm literally sobbing because I've done a long-distance before, and I cannot imagine how absolutely crappy the past year has been for y'all. Congrats, Mazel Tov, hell yeah.
Today I found out that her fiancé lives in the same city as me and to say the least I have completed fan girled, p.s. kayla pls do a meet a greet in Portsmouth bcoz I can’t handle the fact that you’ve been here when I have and I didn’t even know you were here .
Someone's getting married ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I am sooo Happy for you!
Are you going on 90 day fiance
Couples trip to Mexico!☀️🏝⛱ congrats on your engagement!
The people that disliked this were all the people that wanted to marry Kayla or Dan
I'm so glad you finally got a date!!! Can't wait to see you and Dan in your engagement photos and just living together again!! Your cat must be excited as well lol.
i'm literally so happy for you, i'm crying for you kayla, you guys are meant to be!   you guys are going to slay the aisle!

How did waiting this process out and spending so much time apart affect your relationship?
WOOOOOO
Will the process be simpler if you ever do decide to move to the UK? As you’ll already be his spouse?
How is lilsimsie a 14 year old engaged 😂
That’s what my aunt did for her French boyfriend :)
europe is not a country
WAIT- are you actuallly engaged????
"So my fiance and I" girl why you say that like it's nothing. Btw congratulations! ❤️
How exciting! Congratulations Kayla and Dan! I'm so happy for you that this video brought tears to my eyes!  ~ Mamajay76
Congratulations girl!!!!
😍😍😭😭😍😍I watch you all the time I’m so happy for you
not me not even being american or britsh but already knowing everything about the visa from philza minecraft 😐
OMG YESS GIRLLL😭😭💖💖
HUH?!❤️
Wait, she’s engaged?!
Okay hear me out... Wedding in the Sims
I moved to the US on a K1 (from the UK also) in 2018 so I get the stress you're both going through. If Dan has any questions or is worried about the interview I'd be happy to help any way I can ☺️
I am so excited for you two!!!! This is amazing!!
Since he's not allowed to work for six months, can he not stream or edit then?🤔
can we make wedding venues in the sims and tag you?
Congratulations!!! Can't wait to see the progress you two go through!  (I would have rather immigrated to Japan, but my boyfriend was already here in the states when we met)
Congratulations I hope all goes well !
I watch twitch videos on more simsie and still didn’t know this?! Congratulations on your engagement! Exciting times ahead of you 🥰
I never comment on anything but I am so so happy for you and I’m excited for the both of you! I hope everything goes smoothly!!!
❤️So excited for you and Dan! Congratulations on the interview! Fingers crossed that everything goes smoothly and QUICKLY! 😊
Yeaahhh, visa's are dumb. Me and my husband got married THEN applied for a visa, was a lot simpler. I'm American and he's English too but I moved to the UK, lol.

I’ve never been so excited for an engagement in my life omg
I'm not the sort of person who considers herself to be emotional, but, I found myself choking up more than once as you explained what had happened and the long, long journey it's taken to get here. Congratulations to you both, wishing you the best. I'm so very happy for you.
I was deadass convinced this was a prank and I'm still suspicious tbh
I saw Kayla finish HS, enter and finish college and now getting engaged.... THEY GROW UP SO FAST
🥳🥳🥳🥳
Wait... She got engaged?????? Where the ring??? Congratulations!!!!
I know a same-sex couple from twitch who have been fighting for a marriage visa for years in the uk. Good luck! I'm rooting for you both! I've been told the visas can be freaking stressful as heck.
I’ve discovered your channel in summer 2019 while visiting my boyfriend after submitting our K1! I’ve been watching since then
Congrats!!!!
Yayyy congratulations 🥺🥺
The interview is 28 days after Tom Holland birthday!! Yeah...I’m creepy...

I literally screamed when I saw this notification pop up. This is so freaking cool! Another streamer that went through this is Philza Minecraft and he's on YouTube and Twitch
her eyes are very beautiful
OMGGGH IM SO FUCKING HAPPY 😭😭
I’ve never been so happy for anyone ever. cannot wait to see you both living your best lives together!! <3
So happy for you and Dan, Kayla! ❤❤❤ love you too <3
Congratulations Kayla, this is very exciting news! But quite the stressful and long process. I really hope everything works out and he can get over to you quickly!
So happy for you Kayla! Congratulations hope all goes well !
Kayla, sorry to tell you but you’ve already told us you applied so we already knew...
CONGRATULATIONS KAYLA
but we’re... kids
oh my goooood!!! congrats, kayla! we love u both, so so happy for the news. hoping everything is gonna go real smooth from now on ♡♡
Yay!! I'm so happy for you!! I loved the part where you said that it's weird to have your life in the hands of the government. My boyfriend, who was a Marine, heard it and said "welcome to the club".
Hey Congratulations! Don't mind the memes and all. I'm happy about the news!
Congratulations Kayla! What a relief it must be to finally have a bit of a timeline.
KAYLA OMG
Congrats and best of luck, Kayla and Dan! 😄❤
Went through the CR1 process (denmark).   Your rundown was great explanation to those who do not know!   Congrats on moving to the next step!!  Its worth the effort!
Congratulations Kayla!
His interview is my birthday. Good vibes! Best wishes.
*me over here being invested in two people on the internet that I’ve never met’s relationship*
So youre his sugar momma? This seems sketchy to me. You are on Youtube and can make money from wherever, you could just go there. Youre his a meal ticket
Congrats Kayla!
I’ve been waiting for this!! (Ps I got your haircut today!)
Omg Congrats ❤️🥺
Congratulations!
OMG!!! I’m so happy for you!!
I've gone through this a bit with my two friends, her Husband moved from Australia and yeah the Visa process is sucky.
My husband and I are so happy for you both.  Good luck and I hope he can move here soon.  Congratulations
My fiancé lives halfway across the country, and thanks to the pandemic, I haven't seen him in the past year either, because... yeahhhhh stuff happened. That whole... 2020 thing! Moving across the country to be together is bad enough (**sympathizes in long distance relationship**), I can't imagine dealing with visas on top of it!!
Since he’s not allowed to work does that mean he can’t stream? Or is that not his official “job” also congrats!!!
Super congrats! That’s fangtastic!
I'm so excited for you and I'm going through something similar. My fiancé is American and I'm Canadian and we haven't seen each other in a year and a half because the border is closed. We can't start the visa process yet because he can't cross the border (yay COVID), but stories like this let me know it's possible... and stuff like this DOES happen.
Congratulations!
hahaha "trying to move my cat" I LOVE IT!!!
90 Day Fiance
Meanwhile over here in my 30s and soooooo alone and single lol
Congrats, Kayla! You guys are adorable! ❤❤❤
So happy for you 😊
Congrats!!!!
Congrats!

CONGRATS 🎊
Congratulations Kayla!!!
💚Congratulations💚 Hunny. Dan's a lucky guy. Best wishes to both of you. Much love from Canada 🇨🇦
omfg kayla i’m so happy for you
I’m so happy for you two! I met my boyfriend online as well, he’s from Germany. His dad is American so he has dual citizenship and was able to move here when he finished high school in June. Coincidentally, we met in person for the first time on June 29th. Crazy. Covid has been really tough on long distance relationships and I am so glad you’ll be moving forwards despite it. Congratulations!
Very happy for you. It must have felt at times like it might never happen but you have the date!! Can't wait until D gets to move in. Happy happy sweet girl. ❤️🎉👏😃
Congratulations to you both on finally getting an interview date!
CONGRATULATIONS ✨✨✨✨
Good for you
Kayla is gonna be a nightmare finding their dream family home...
Immigrating is a hard process in normal time, so I can't imagine the stress right now  I hope you will be reunited soon :) Congrats :)
“Nobody just applies for this on a whim” except the sims
I honestly thought you lived in England and was English
I'm so happy for you both!! Congratulations!! 🥳🥳
AWWWWW

Im so happy for you :)
Kayla!! I'm super excited for you, these news make my day! I have so much respect for the person that sued Donald´s government :)
Omggg
Yoohoo big wedding blowout
Congratulations, Kayla!! Make sure to book your courthouse wedding ceremony in advance, you’d be surprised how long the waitlists can be. My fiancé and I had to wait three months to get in last October 😅
I love you
Actually really cool to have a more in-depth look of how these visas work. I think it made perfect sense how you explained it :D congrats on the progress of your case; let the countdown begin!!
super happy for you and Dan ❤️❤️❤️

CONGRATULATIONS!!!
Omg i thought you were like 16
Good luck! I hope everything goes well!
I haven’t watch the full video yet but whatt ??? Congratulations omg
Thanks for this really informative video, Kayla. I've been worrying about visas and stuff too, and this was really helpful. Not many people talk about these things online.
can I just say I am so happy for you guys and there is no pressure to share your personal life with us (in real-time or like at all!) I'm just glad you both are happy and getting some movement in your life!! Congrats!! <3
KAYYLAA YESS omg I’m so happy for you. You are the reason why I started having fun with sims again lol

Even though I’ve known about this forever it feels amazing to see it on YouTube!
This is great news, Kayla! So happy for both of you! I’m going through a similar situation with my greencard renewal...applied in March 2020 and haven’t heard anything since. Immigration is such a crazy roller coaster 😨
That would be the most boring episode of 90 Day Fiance. Hate to break it to you Kayak, but you and Dan are way too normal for TLC fame. (And that's a good thing!) Congrats on having a functional relationship!
yall remember when dan and kayla were on stream and they pretended to be so grossed out when they were talking abt marrying each other asdfghjkl i love them theyre so cute 😭
“I too am very excited”
Congrats!! We're so excited for you both!! 🥰🥳😆
So happy for you!! My father in law is trying to get out of the military. We moved states right before the panorama hit and we only thought itd take like a few months for him to move here but it's been a year and a half since anything. We finally got some news earlier this week and he should be here in about a month. Our family understands your pain and excitmemt. This is great news! Congrats
Anyone else more shocked that she has a car than the fact that she's engaged 😂😂  I don't know why my brain is fine with her getting married and having a great life but a car!!!
congratulations, so happy for you two!!
Recreate the engagement in animal crossing 😂
Omg it's like that with high-school interviews you refresh and check everyday nothing has happened yet sadly. I remember watching you when I was in 5th grade and now I'm in 8th :,)  time flies by
Congrats!
Congrats!!! I'm so happy for you!!!!!!! I cannot believe that you've grown so much!!
Next video: so... I am married to Dan Next next video: so... I am pregnant Next next next video: I am naming my kid Cowplant

Congrats Kayla! 💜
This is very exciting! I’m thrilled for you both 💛
Congratulations!!!
I’ve been watching you since 2015 and now you’re engaged! Congrats Simsie!🎉 You have literally been such a huge part of my childhood, but again congrats!!!
I’ve got a question, if you don’t mine. I know he can’t work when he moves here for so many days. Does that mean he has to stop streaming or monetization from his streams.
Why does he want to come here 😂
Congrats Kayak!  You deserve it ❤️
Oh my god!!!! Yes !!! I actually get married next weekend to my once long distance boyfriend. So happy for you chicky ❤️
I’m so happy for you 🥺
CONGRATS
Congratulations on your engagement!! 🎉🎊 Your experience and waiting for your process to move forward, really reminded me of myself refreshing my emails like every hour of the day when I was waiting for my settlement status so I'm able to stay in the UK because of Brexit 😂 obviously waiting time was a lot shorter, but not knowing what's going to happen and having your life in the hands of the government is scary 😂😂, but again congratulations on your engagement!!
i picture her getting an emerald in the marquis shape so it looks like a plumbob for her engagement ring 💚💚💚
AWWWW OMG
Y’all my birthday is June 29 wow I hope they approve your visa Kayla.
Didn’t we know that when she was talking about him moving to America? I swear I thought I knew this 😂
So happy for you guys! ❤️❤️❤️

👁👄👁 me thinking it’s an April fools thing  *looks at calendar*  *April 2nd*  😗
AHHHHHHHH YES YES YES SIMSIE IS A WIFEY
when did you get engaged?? 😍😍😍😍😍😍 congrats!!!
CONGRATULATIONS!! 🎉
Not all countries in Europe are banned from traveling to the USA. I live in Portugal and we only need a negative covid test up to 72h before the flight time
congratulations kayla!! i hope the stress of this all is over soon. i hope you guys are super happy when he can come here ❤️ Edit: a question: if Dan will not be able to work for a while after moving will he still be able to stream on twitch and everything? does it just apply to like “proper” jobs?
Visit Colombia for 14 days together?? Idk if restrictions are in place here but I don't think so bc I saw a ton of people going to the US in december
Been there! Sorta. With a UK student visa, though, and it was in 2018. I ran into complications with one signature that was missing. I ended up crying in a US immigration center office, or whatever they're called, with a security guard yelling at me to leave and the office manager coming over like "oops lmao yeah, we were supposed to do that, my b". She fixed it, the security guard wandered off without a word, and I left. I was still crying on my way home and my Uber driver didn't speak English. When visa stuff goes wrong, it goes really dramatically wrong. Here's hoping it's smooth sailing from here on out for you two! Congrats!
"Country Europe" ah yes american
That’s so awesome! I’m in almost the same position, except we haven’t started any of the steps to get my bf to the US. This info is sooo helpful! Thank you!
OMG YAAAAAYYYYYY i have been watching u since episode 1 of the 100 baby I love u soo much CONGRATS 🥳 🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎊
THIS IS SO EXCITING ITS LIKE MY MOM GETTING MARRIED, i practically grew up watching you, so so happy for you
*in five years* "so... i am getting divorced"  /j /j /j congrats kayla :)
OMG CONGRATS
I’m gonna scream!!! Kayla, I’ve been watching your channel for so long now and I always heard what you’d say about Dan and hoped something like this would happen. You guys have such good synergy and vibes- it almost seemed inevitable! This is amazing news!!! Congrats!!!
I've been engaged once and he cheated, so other 21 yo have kids and married. So she's lucky along with other 21 yo 🥲
What? Engaged!? OMG! 😳 Congratulations! I still think you two look like siblings but... still congrats! 🎉
I'm so happy ToT
Random thought here, she will no longer be Kayla Sims...if she does decide to change her name.
so exciting!!! happy for you two <3
Congratulations!! Ahh oh my gosh!!!! I’m so happy for youuu!!!!! YESSS 🎉 💍💐🌺✨🌏
The only reason I would have picked the UK to live is the NHS.  It's okay Kayla you aren't missing much staying in the US!
So I'm in next to the same situation... Instead I am the Dan in this situation. But first things first. Girl, you did know you are allowed to go see him right? You are a US citizen so your country will allow you to reenter and the UK allows you to enter here too.  Me and my partner have done this twice during the pandemic, which has lead to our plan.  We've been engeded for over 6 months now (nearly 3 years together) and we are having a digital wedding hosted by Utah in a couple of weeks which is new but totally legal as they introduced it this year. So we are going Spouse visa route so that we can still visit each other in both directions but also the thing takes about 13-16 months but gives you an automatic greencard that allows you to work and stay for 2 years, which you can then upgrade to 10 years. Best of luck in your journey! It is incredibly frustrating
Ahhhh!! I’m so proud of you and Dan, I’m a newish sub but watched most of your vids by now and it’s crazy that yall are finally able too be together seriously I’m so happy for you both!
Glad you didn't post this yesterday, no one would have believed you. Congratulations, it's finally moving forward!
Some countrys than proceeds to say europ as an example
It honestly all feels like a blur! I am so happy and excited for you both. I sent you my personal situation..ish? Over on Discord. (Not sure if you'll see this, but yea).
Damnit, my wife is gonna go crazy with this news - must. Not. Let. Her. Watch.
I've been watching ur videos for a long time and you're one of my fav youtubers so when this came up on my recommended i was like what 😳but im literally so happy for u two congrats!!! <333🥺💕
So to be clear, you got engaged just so he could come over from the UK?
Congrats to you both!! Fingers crossed that everything goes smoothly for you.
kayla......... his interview is my due date
Oh I'm so happy for you, you have been so patient sure it has been hard for you, time will go fast, ty so much for sharing have been wondering
Yay! Im so happy for you!
I went through the exact same thing, except with the spouse visa instead of the fiancé. No lawsuit needed but we had our own challenges on top of dealing with covid. And we didn’t get to visit each other for over a year. So I’ve been there, I know the stress and the constant what-ifs but it’s soooo worth it when you get that interview email. It’s all downhill from here girl!
is this late april fools congrats tho
I’m so excited for you guys!!!
Congratulations!
tell me how i’m younger than her and I watched HER grow up
Kayle congrats overseas I have an idea overseas wedding.
getting SOOOOOOOOOOO excited even though I did NOT get engaged OR got a visa to move to another country. BUT STILL HAPRYYY
Congrats! I’m so happy for you :)
Not gonna lie, my ex and I decided elope on one of his trips here, so he stayed with me and we applied as a married couple...guess it helped at our interview a few months later that I was already pregnant XD.
Can i just say that i really appreciate that you posted this video today rather than on april first, because i honestly may not have clicked on it yesterday lol. congrats on the interview date!
OMG KAYLA CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!
awwww. i hope everything goes well for you two <3
Congrats Kayla!
I was supposed to get married last May. We had a year and a half engagement and a huge party planned. We were so close when everything shut down. Even if we wanted to get married on our wedding date, courts weren't open. It took us a month and a half to get a marriage license, and our wedding was officiated by our city council member because DC wasn't processing new officiant licenses and we didn't want to be married by a justice of the peace over a zoom call. We eventually got married last June in my friends backyard with immediate family present, but getting to that point was a nightmare. It took a month and a half for them to process our marriage application and 5 months for them to process our marriage certificate. I got married in June and I am still trying to get everything updated to my married name.   I had a truly awful pandemic engagement process, but it was a walk in the park compared to your experience. I'm so sorry! Ironically, getting my new passport with my new name was one of the easier bureaucratic  processes I've gone through in the last year. I'm glad that you can see the light at the end of the tunnel! Congratulations!!
OMG!!!!!
So It means she could be married by her birthday congrats
Aww I’m so happy for you guys ❤️
OMG!!!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!! I'm so happy for both of you!
Two of my friends went through this and it took them three years to get everything finalized. So, yeah, I get how absurdly hard this process is. They really need to revamp the whole immigration process to make it a bit more user-friendly. :)
Yay, congrats! And it was fun hearing a real person talking about the K1 visa, as a 90 days fan :)) funny how on the show they make it sound like the visa application costs between 10 and 20k dollars 😅
Congrats. Glad the process is going better for you now with the visa. Our lil sissies has grown so much in front of our eyes.
WOOOW YAY
Congratulations 🥳
So this is why she hasn't posted for a few days
I love you Kayla but this is why people marry people that live in the same country :)
AHHHH
OMG CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!! I can’t even imagine how hard it would be to get all this stuff fixed in the middle of a pandemic- <3
Congrats Kayak and Dan!!!!
Congratulations Kayak!
Going through the same right now. But in Canada. Same crazy amount of paperwork 🙄🙄🙄 they have my file since December and haven’t even opened it 🙄
Congratulations 🎊

Congrats to both you and Dan! <3
CONGRATS 🎉

Wow, this is so exciting! Congratulations to you two!

Congratulations!!! I am so happy for you and Dan!!
Congratulations Kayla!! 😍
I started off hearing about Susan... and now Kaylas engaged 😮. I cant expressed how excited I am for her!!! But also I’m kinda in shock because I feel like I heard about Susan yesterday....
Wow Simsie, I am so happy for you. For me your channel is a huge safe space and you feel like a older sister to me. That you and Dan are getting married and will live together, warms my hart.

Congrats to you both!!! <3
Waiting is truly the worst! I too read and watch tons of stuff on immigration. We're waiting for an interview in London for our IR1 visa.
AHHHHHHHHH congrats Kayla!!!!
i have watched you for years... we’re the same age, and it feels like i’ve grown up with you. i am screaming!!
We care a lot! I've never watched your twitch streams and I had no idea Dan was from england! You did a great job explaining the process. I can tell you understand the process fairly well. Congrats, Kayla. That is so exciting

I SAW THIS IN MY RECOMMENDED FEED AND I HAD A HEART ATTACK YAY KAYAK
Aww Kayla I’m so happy for you 🥲 you deserve it after all this work you do to entertain us 😂 I hope you and your fiancé have a great life together and you will be happy with Him. Keep up the great work and the videos that make us smile. (I’m looking forward to seeing you walk down The aisle) ❤️❤️
Congratulations Kayla
I got married at 21 and for me it has been the best thing in my life. It is 100% not for everyone but I’ve been married for four years now and we have such an amazing time together. I hope for the best for you guys coming out of this pandemic!
Congratulations!! Hoping for the best <3
My boyfriend & I are in a long distance relationship as well currently 🇺🇸-🇧🇪 , what is some of your biggest advice you can give? It’d be too soon for us to already get married but what made it easier for you in all this meantime without him? Sorry if this sounds so vague ahah
I think that a little over 1.19 million people are happy for you and even though I’m two hours late I’m happy to say that I’m one of them 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Congrats to the both of you!
Congratulations!!  Yes my aunt was here during Feb-March of last year and her visa expired before she was able to leave (her flight kept getting rescheduled and things kept changing) and we still haven’t heard back whether or not her visa will be renewed or not.
So happy for you!! Congrats!!!!!!
I can't even imagine so congratulations 🎉
I hope you two can be together soon ♥ Time is too short for this bullshit, but unfortunately freedom is only for the super ultra rich
general question: is she really engaged if she wasn’t proposed to?
eyyyy congrats
SO HAPPY FOR YOU!
CONGRATULATIONS KAYLA! That is absolutely amazing!
Congrats Kayla and Dan!
Kayla was def like I cannot post this on April Fools because nobody will take me seriously
Aww that's cute. Congrats!
I wonder as the UK isn't actually part of Europe anymore, would it still apply the travel ban. Also as someone who was meant to move to Japan from the UK 7 months ago and still no idea when I will be allowed to move and waiting for an email and been through this process of applying and waiting for just under 2 years, I get the stress <3 <3
Congratulations  I hope everything goes well with the rest of your k-1 visa process.
Congrats! This is so exciting and brave of you guys
They're so cute together 💕
My oldest cousin married a gal from the Phillipines. Its a long process and lots of paperwork. He had to give financial info to show she would be financially cared for. Along with tons of other paperwork.
Omg 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
OMG CONGRATULATIONS KAYLAA!!!
OMG! CONGRATS!
I hope he is your endgame 🥰

Omg congrats I'm so happy for you guys 💜💜💜💜
Wait... when did they get engage? Or like for how long?
First of all, CONGRATULATIONS!!! I actually am very interested in these things because my partner and I haven't been able to see each other in over a year and a half because of the pandemic and are now planning on moving to a third party country because of visas. This was super helpful hearing the breakdown of the K-1 visa in a simplified, easy to digest way, so major thank you!
ITS ON MY BROTHERS BIRTHDAY!! Best of luck!!
I'm so happy for you:D
I'm from Russia, My boyfriend and I have been dating for 3 years now. He's from Turkmenistan (if you don't know it's like North Korea but from Soviet Union) And we're in a very complicated situation with all this stuff (imigration/visas/passport)
So happy for you two ! ❤️
OMG CONGRATSSS
Wow, you’re so young but I’m so happy for you. Hope everything works out.
Congratulations on posting this video!
Congratulations! My husband is from London and initially I moved there, but after a year we decided to move back to my hometown in Oregon. It is quite a process, and preach 🙌🏻 the K1 is not to decide if you want to marry! We never did a fiancé visa as we just got hitched in Reno on one of his visits 😁
omg i thought this was a joke at first but she’s really engaged
Mandem
Woo hoo!
Bro
Matey
i’ve been hearing this a lot on stream because i watch almost all your streams and i’m watching this video because i’m curious to see how your going to tell youtube this
Im so happy for you!!🙂🌸
Noice mate
YAY!
Congratulations! My boyfriend and I were separated for 2 weeks because of the pandemic and it was miserable... I can't imagine being separated for OVER A YEAR. I would die, lmao. So happy that you guys can be together again!
i like how matter-of-factly she is
THEY GOT ENGAGED SJJAJAJZJZ CONGRATS
CONGRATS!!
this is so strange because i've been watching your vids since you were a senior in high school (when i was in 5th grade) and now you've graduated college and are engaged, and i'm in my first year of high school so we've kinda grown together n i think that's really cool :) congrats kayla and dan!!
it feels so weird knowing people my age are getting married LMAO i'm very happy for you two, this is so exciting!! congratulations!!
Dan and Simsie channel?
big simsie :)
OHMYGOD KAYLEIGH I'M LITERALLY CRYINGGGGGG WHATT??? 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Omg congratulations Kayla!! So happy for you guys, you look so happy! <3
HELLO?
omg I'm so happy for you 😭💗💗
Kayla!!!! Congrats to you and Dan! That’s amazing news! My husband and I had to deal with the visa as well so I understand your pain and struggle 😂
I reeeeaaaaaly hope you get more good news about this. good luck!
OH MY GOSH!!!!
so happy for u!!!!
GRATS!! im so happy for you!
I am going through this too, apart from my fiancé who's from the US will be coming to the UK. The paperwork is so confusing and the financial requirements are ridiculous 😭 I wish Kayla all the best 🥰
ahhhhhh congrats! i'm so happy for you guys!
But the uk is not in Europa anymore  Brexit dont know how its spelled
congratulations
It is interesting to hear about the process from the other side! I am a paralegal for the BIA so I work on appeals for these types of cases :) Congrats on your engagement and I wish nothing but the best for the future processing of your visa
i love listening to you talk, Kayla! Good luck on the journey <3
Congratulations!!
Wow, congrats. I just got engaged last month, and listening to your visa nightmares, I am thanking my lucky stars that my fiance is locally-based. lol. But congratulations! (Also, it was a good call not to post this video yesterday. No one would have believed this. lol)
Kinda soon in my opinion.
Congrats! Really happy for you both!   Found this really Interesting actually, didn’t know you could move to the US like this!  Ive spent some time looking at US Immigration. and I also live in the UK (and called Dan haha).  Always dreamt about moving to the US as love the country! Spent a fair amount of time in Texas once upon a pre covid.   So.. Just need to find a wife then... 😂
As a Brit, it made me happy that you said you'd like to the live the UK :) hope everything works out for you guys, best of luck! :D
Congregations! I’m so glad y’all finally have a date scheduled for the interview and finally able to get moving on this!
SIMSIEEEEEE SO HAPPY FOR YOU 💜💜💜
Please tell me how this whole video is legal mumbo-jumbo and I felt like crying the entire time. I'm so happy for you two! ❤️😭
So cute, congrats! I recently got engaged as well!
Omg omg omg 🤩 yessss
Imagine this happened yesterday and she posted it yesterday and nobody believes her because April fools
be careful lol sometimes they will ask questions like personal questions just to see if yall know a lot about one another like eye colors, hair, maybe even what side of the bed you sleep on etc. Sometimes they have absurd questioning processes.
The loading screen for dan to enter America  is still loading 😕
This is so cool - thank you for sharing!
YAAAYYYY
Congratulations!! Although I was kind of hoping you’d move to England because it’s quite nice here too 😊
pandemic?? travel ban?? i didnt know
so has he like proposed or is he prosing when he gets to america im soooooo confused congrats gurl tho
Whoo!!! Congratulations!! ❤️
CONGRATS
but... you're only 13.....
OMG IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
Just listening to this process is causing me headache....It reminds me of the process we applied for permanent resident card...
CONGRATULATIONS 🎉!!!!
YOOOOOOO
❤❤❤❤❤
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
Congratulations Kayla hope you and your fiance have wonderful years to come 😊
KAYAK’S GOT A HUBBY OMG
congratulations simsie!!!!!
CONGRATULATIONS KAYLA!!!! ♥️♥️🎉🎊
Yay!!! Congratulations you guys!!
OMGGGG CONGRATS 😆😆😆 I’m glad your happy i can’t wait to see your wedding and stuff omg you two are so cute 🥰 I’m just so happy for you 😁
I love how kaylas and my life are so similar, I’m german and my boyfriend is british and with brexit i also need a visa so we absolutely have discussed engagements before 😂😂
Yayyyyyyyyyy
Every time kayla talks about her relationship it feels like I’ve missed a few episodes
I’m so happy for you guys ❤️😭
Congrats!!! I'm so happy for you!!!!
Imaging being so deeply in love with someone that you would go through so much to the point you join a lawsuit against the government to be with each other!  I am so happy for the both you!! 🥰🥰🥰
My sister is also in the same situation. She’s been stuck in France for over a year while her fiancé is in the USA. It’s been so hard for her, but we hope to get news about travel ban soon.
I’m so happy and excited with you! Congrats!
Congrats!   I hope all of this works out for you guys.  It really is interesting the process to get married to someone who is not from this country.
Congratulations and good luck!! ahhhhhhhhh
CONGRATS SO HAPPY FOR YOU BESTIE 💗
Congrats
Kayla I am so happy for you both. I watch your streams for over a year now so I feel basically like my friend got engaged. After this long time of waiting, you probably wouldn't have to wait for him ever again in few months. Lots of love for you girl ❤️
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH CONGRATS!!!!!
I’m so happy for you and Dan!
CONGRATS KAYLA!! ❤️❤️
congratssssss!!!
so happy for u!! congrats
Awwwwwwwwww🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥰🥰
Awwww congrats 🥳🥂
My husband is from the UK and we were *so* lucky that he did all his visa stuff in January of 2020, so we very narrowly avoided what you're going through. Long distance is so hard but the end is in sight! Congrats!
Wow congrats dude, I didn't know u were engaged
Two best friends getting married 😊
Congrats Kayla! :) Tbh... all this hassle will be enough for me to not move to another country xD
CONGRATS CONGRATS CONGRATS 🥺🥺
Happy new year kayla !!!!!!! From turkeeeeeey
Wait why doesn’t dan just take a one way plane ticket and bring what he needs and then he just never return?                 this is a joke
Omg you guys look so similar!
thank you for making this video! my partner lives in scotland and we were considering starting this process, so it's super helpful.
CONGRATULATIONS
heh, his interview is on my sisters birthday, I'll try and remember to send good vibes yalls way!
All the fees are SO ridiculous that it actually makes me feel sorry for you two! I’m glad you have a date but I still feel sorry for you two 😔
I'm so happy for you!!! Congrats!!!
Aw Kayla, I feel so happy for you. I so hope you get reunited soon!!
I'll admit I was initially like "OMG ENGAGED *click*" but I still watched the whole video because it was really interesting. My parents had to go through the same process 21 years ago but I never knew how it worked until now. Cool! and Congratulations :)
Congratulations!
As someone going through the K1 visa process, I'm so jealous! We applied in May 2020, still waiting on interview. Canada, waiting on the NVC to send to the Montreal Consulate to receive the interview. Currently we have the NOA2 from January, and they're 10 months behind so maybe we'll get an interview this year. Yikes!
Congratulations Kayla!!! I know you were worried about this video but we support you and love you!!! I am so glad you have some news. I know how frustrating the visa process can be and I can't imagine how much worse it is for a permanent residency visa. I'm so happy for you!!!
Congrats!
AHHHHHHHH IM SO EXCITED FOR YOU, KAYLA!!!
Congratulations!
So happy for you Kayla. Best of luck with the big move Dan.
SIMSIE IS ENGAGED WHY AM I SO OLD OMG
Smart guy
I saw the “90 day fiancé” thing and thought this was an April fools joke (then I remembered it’s not April first anymore) ... I am very happy for you congratulations
Isn't it crazy that the government has so much control that you can't just live on the other side of a pretty much fictional border
🥳🎉💃🎈
WOOO!!!! I'm so happy for you!!!! <3
I saw it when you tweeted and was so happy for you!!! I listen to/watch your stream VODs daily, so I feel like I've been right beside you in this long wait over the past year!
Kayla at 21: successful, engaged, doing well in life, bought a house, living alone. me, at 24 almost 25: family disappointment, broke, still living at home, doesn't make enough money to live half the time, can't keep a guy for more than 6 months.  but Congrats, ignore my bitterness. I'm honestly so happy for you.
I am so excited for you and Dan! You have been one of my favorite YouTubers for so long. You are truly the happy spirit that lifts my day! I have best wishes for you and Dan! Hopefully you get to have the beautiful wedding you deserve with everyone you love there! (After the pandemic of course! :))
OMG... Hope everything goes well, wish you luck ♥
Congrats Kayla!!! So happy there’s news on the case’
OMG CONGRATS
KAYLA!! CONGRATS!!! i can't believe that the girl i have been watching from her college dorm is going to be married and have a husband!!!!
i read the title as "i am so engaged"
Congratulations! Wishing the best 💐
How could kayak, a 14 year old be engaged!
Congratulations!
Congratulations!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow congratulations Kayla!!! :D
CONGRATS🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
CONGRATS SIMSIE!! So excited for y'all 💍💐
I got crazy because I bought a phone that was supposed to get here in 3 business days but it took two weeks... she's been waiting for over a year.... and for a person so... maybe I exagerated
Haven't even watched the video yet, but just reading the title I'm so happy for you Kayla!
I remember when you were 16 and ranting about susan and now you're getting married. You're older than me but *sniff* they grow up so fast
When I saw the title I went POGGG
Oh my god, I am so happy for you Kayla! Congrats!
not all country´s just *europe*
Congrats!!
wait what is this the engagement anouncment? or did i miss out on it?
I'm so happy for you!
congrats!!!!!! im so happy for you
If you need engagement photos, I would be honored! :)
My husband and I just got his green card, so I feel you on people SO NOT getting the visa/immigration process. Lots of bad advice from well-meaning folks. Congrats to you both, though!
Congrats and good luck with the rest of the process.
Congrats
Just wanted to say that I’m in Florida Rn and could possibly meet Kayla lmao
Congrats on getting the interview date! 2 of my close friends have been waiting to get papers finalized too - they wed in 2019 but then the case was halted in February 2020 bc of the /events/ so I can imagine how much of a nightmare this has been for you two <3
I live in Sweden, one of the 49 states in the great country of Europe
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
"trying to move my cat" 😂😂😂 well that's definitely the most important thing to consider
Yesssssssss 🥳🥳🥳 good luck with the rest of the process !
Congratulations!!!
Omg Congrats!!! Sooooo happy for you and Dan💚💚 Hopefully the rest of the process will go smoothly and quickly for you both.    My brother is going through similar visa issues with his GF. Different country but almost the same issues.
Congratulations, I hope that you and Dan will be reunited soon, and that you'll be able to enjoy some rest 💕💖
hun you're a day late for april fools
Wow I'm honestly at loss of words congratulations! I remember when in the video on Valentine's Day when Kayla was building a wedding venue she said "I'm probably gonna use this idea on my wedding in years and years.." so it's honestly surprising to me, CONGRATULATIONS!🎉
The smile I got when I saw this video omg!!!!!!!
Aww congratulations!!!
whaaaaa??????????????????? OH
CONGRATS!!!!!
I'm happy to hear you've finally got a solid date! I look forward to hearing that Dan got the visa and can finally move out to the US. :)
congratz
I’m so happy for you!!!!!!!!!!!
OMGGGGGGG
I'm very happy for you <3 Best wishes that everything moves smoothly and he gets moved in sooner rather than later!
I am Spanish, and I am living in the Netherlands with my boyfriend. As I was seeing this video, I could only think about how lucky I am that I just had to get a social security number, for free, and get my birth certificate and bring it to the town hall, also for free, any day, to regulate my status... Because if I would have been in your fiancé's position, I couldn't have been able to afford it. I am so sorry that governments think that there are first class and second class human beings, and it all depends on where do you come from... I cannot imagine the nightmare and how life-consuming this process has been for you, and also for your poor fiancé... Congrats! I am really, truly, genuinely happy for the both of you!
Girl. You’re only 21 though?!
Fab news Kayla so happy for you and Dan 🤞🏻🤞🏻 the whole process will run smoothly 🤗😊🤞🏻🤞🏻
My sis has lived in America for 20plus years. Is a full american citizen and that wouldn't help me move over... so yer... u csnt just get a Visa and move lol
when did you get engaged ??!!?!!?!??
Congrats Kayla! So happy for you two!!
I am over the moon for you both. I’ve felt so upset that you two and so many others have been apart for so long. So so happy!!
Aweeeee
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU <3 I hope its quick and easy going forward and look forward to your happiness <3
It’s kinda sad that they haven’t seen each other in over a year 🥲
My brother met his fiancée when he was deployed in Japan and they applied in November 2019 and they’re still waiting it’s a LONG process! Happy y’all got the ball rolling!! Congrats ❤️
hearing little baby simsie say the word *g o n o r r h e a* just feels so wrong to me
i’m so happy for u simsie <3
OH MY GOD AHHHH CONGRATULATIONS!!!
Couple channel? Lilduckling?! Omg 😂🥰
As someone who is planning on moving to America from Europe later in life, this video was really educational.
There so many things I want to say but I’ll just leave a ♥️ instead...
OH MY GOOOODDDDD, I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU BOTH
What
Congrats Kayla and Dan!!!! Good luck to both of you and I hope things start settling into place quickly for  you so that you guys can finally be together. <3
Congrats guys!!!😊😊
Yaay Dans coming to the US hopefully he doesn’t hate it 🤣 congrats
Me, initially: OMG she's so young and she's already gonna get married, that's so scary! Me, after two seconds: *realizes I've been in a relationship for nearly 9 years, have moved in together for over two years and am still only 24* I'm really out here thinking her situation is scary when I've been through similar things nearly unscathed
WHAAT!!
Congratulations! 🍾
OH MY GOSH!!!!!!! I'm SO HAPPY FOR UUUU
you're living my dream life in so many ways... my god... vegan gamer girl with her own house and getting married to a great guy after only just finishing college- graduating early at that! You're a powerhouse.
SOOOOO excited for you Kayla!!
I am so happy for you both. Congrats!!!! You are glowing and happiness is always a good look on a person.
are you gonna plan your wedding on the sims like you did with decorating your office,, but congrats kayak 😩
WOOOOOO!!!
i want to say congrates on the engagment
i was thinking ‘hey kayla you’re a day late for april fools’ and then i remembered the time zone difference from us to uk and went ‘OH MY GOODNESS HECK YEAH KAYLA’ my mum was very worried
See Kayla, no under 13 year old could've done this <3  On a serious note, I'm super happy for you guys, the visa process is rough from what I've heard.
10:43 Not all countries are banned from travel to the US, just some like... Europe, China and Brasil. I taught that americans joked about Europe being a country. Do americans think Europe is a coutry???
kayla i’m so happy for you and dan 🥰 congrats
Congratulations!!
Oh, sis, in my opinion you're way too young, but good luck! I wish you both the best and all the happiness in the world.   There's no wrong or right time for marriage - if you feel ready and you're an adult capable of making rational decisions, then go for it! Some people find happiness marrying young, some people find happiness marrying old, and some people find happiness not marrying at all. I couldn't imagine marrying before 30, but that's just me; I would've probably tried with a student or work visa first, as many of my friends did, but everyone has different outlooks and plans! Wish you both many happy days 😊
hi
Congratulations!!!
When my sister and I saw the video title, we were so happy! Congratulations, Kayla! It must have been so hard being away for so long and with so much uncertainty. You deserve a win and I'm so happy for you!
You'll be the cutest 12 years old bride 🥺
sims kids are going to freak when they realize if you watch her on twitch you would’ve known for MONTHS
Congrats I’m so happy for you! Enjoy your engagement before you guys become wed
I'm so happy for you guys, congrats!
Video concept! You make urself and Dan in the sims and stage a proposal and thats what ur wedding invitations will be😂
congratulations kayla!
fabulous news :) Can't wait to hear more about it now that things are happening
Oh not a ring
wait till tikok realizes that 12 year old kayla is engaged 🤚🏻
Congratulations!! It's great to hear things are finally moving for you both! I have also been living alone and without my partner for the past year and know how hard it's been and how much it sucks. Here's to things looking up soon!
so so happy for her!! i can't believe kayak is getting married already, we literally watched her grow from a teen to an adult. crazy
Man, I was annoyed just needing to fill out 1 page of paper work to get married. I can't even imagine. We got married at our local municipal building lol. Way before Covid. Maybe one day we can have a party 😅 I hope your process keeps moving forward and everything goes well! I can't imagine that stress. But I'm sure it feels so good now that some progress has been made!
Kayla saying Europe is a country-
KAYLA IM CRYING
been here since the susan era, so strange seeing how much has changed <3 congratulations kayla and dan
Bruh I honestly don’t understand why the U.S has to be so complicated, like why, just all agree it’s so dumb
Congrats kayak! I hope you guys have a great life together!
congratulations!!
CONGRATS!!! I squealed in excitement when I saw the title.
Is dan going to be aloud to stream on twitch when he moves there? Does that count as working?
congratssss i never knew you weere engaged
waiiiiiittttt whatttt omg is this for real cause  omg
Congratulations!! 🎉🎉
I enjoyed this so much
CONGRATULATIONS
My fiance and I are going through the EXACT SAME THING. But we tried to get him here to meet, and he was denied just because he is Indian. We have been together 5 years. I also live alone.. but I have a house full of animals.. so it kinda helps. LOL Good luck!
GURLLL YESSS CONGRATS
💚💚💚💚
Ummmm when did Kayla get enganged????? omgg
so THIS is why you didn't want to post on april fools day lol  congrats!!!
CONGRATULATIONS SIMSIE
CONGRATS KAYLA!!! i’ve been watching u for so long and ik how hard the process is kind of, my grandmas became a US citizen a while ago and it took like 2 years of just going back and forth w the govt
Can you add Turkish subtitles to the video?
i so happy for you!!!
Oh my gosh, yay! I’m so happy for you and Dan, that’s such great news! ☺️🎉 Hopefully he can get through quickly and easily, and maybe the covid restrictions can ease a bit so it’ll be easier to get here. Congratulations!
love you beeeech
Congratulations Kayla!!! 💚
🥰🥰🥰
Kaylaaaaa! This is wild. It’s always so interesting seeing you advance through life while we are the same age. This is an uptick for sure in your life. I’m very proud.
Im pretty much doing the exact same thing rn but going from Canada to the UK, its torture
CONGRATS OMG AHAHGA
I’m on the Partner Visa for Australia and it cost over $7000 just to press “submit” for the paperwork. But I was onshore so it was a lot easier for me.  I’m sorry that the pandemic has slowed down the process even further. It’s a bit ridiculous!   I hope his interview goes perfectly and he’s able to get to you quickly after that!!
congrats bestie <3
i thought they’d been together like 7 years omg lol this is so exciting!! so dan won’t be able to stream while he’s here?
So happy for Kayla, congratulations TvT
Why can’t you get a American boyfriend?   Sick of females get British boyfriends
Congrats! That's amazing news!!! So happy for you both 💓
OMG OMG OMG. CONGRATULATIONS!!
CONGRATULATIONS!!!
June 29th is my birthday lm so honnered :)
Congrats!! It feels kinda weird, I've been watching your videos since the days of Susan rants and now you're engaged and have graduated!! I feel like a mom even though I'm younger. Anyways I'm happy for you <3
Congratulations! Does Dan plan on getting dual citizenship?
I have never been more excited for someone I do not actually know. Congrats and I am wishing you two all the happiness in the world!!
I'm so happy this worked!! CONGRATULATIONS!! :D
Wow, what a struggle for such a long time, but I am so happy for you Kayla! Goodluck with this interview and medical exam, and congratulations you two :)

congrats both of you! thats so exciting <3
There are no blue suburbans in the uk, therefore you must stay in the US🤔
i read this as enraged
Hooray! I can't imagine how difficult it has been for the two of you being apart all this time. So happy that the end is in sight!
Congratulations 🥰
Congratulations! 🥳🥳
Hey Kayla! Be careful! Make sure you have a Marriage Certificate in 90 days, appointments to get them are really hard in some places! I almost couldn't get mine to happen because of COVID
OMG WHAAAAAAT OMG OMG OMG IM SO EXCITED 😲
Ahhhhhh congratulations you guys!! Love how you breezed passed that so casually. So my boyfriend and I, my fiancé and I... so glad you’ll be able to be together soon!

Congrats kayla and dan!!! <3
I THOUGHT U WERE LIKE MY AGE AND IM 15 WHAT

Congrats Kayla and Dan!
"And I have to move my cat"
lil ducksie engagement is wonderful news, congrats kayak 💓
Lets be real... we all knew
I screamed when i read this! 💙
My stepfather came over on a Visa. He's from Morocco. He's been here a good ten years or so. I can't imagine if they were trying to get him over here now. I don't know if it took any longer than it normally would because he's from a Muslim country.
Congrats!
congrats 🎉
wait... but you look like 15.... I'M CONFUSED
really happy for you simsie🥰
So happy for you! Congrats <3
WHY AM I CRYING
Anyone else remember her in high school and rants about Susan?! They grow up so fast 😭😭
I wish you happiness in your life. ♡
Mmh maybe applying to be on 90 days fiancé would have been quicker actually
IM SO EXITED! Good luck Kayla & Dan we love you!
Congratulations 🎉
omg congrats!!
Congrats Kayla!!
Why am I always getting all of these now that my boyfriend has broke up with me💔💔💔
Congrats! Sounds like applying to grad school honestly...
STFU U SHOULD HAVE PUT THIS FOR AN APRIL FOOLS DAY JOKE AND THEN ACTUALLY BAMBOOZLED US BUT OMG CONGRATS
I'm so happy for you too, wishing you all the best in the world 💗💗💗😭😭😭
I’m so excited for you Kayla! I’m so sorry that this has taken so long, you deserve the world and I hope you and Dan can be together soon!
congratulations!!!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍♥️♥️♥️
These next couple months are probably going to be the hardest.. congrats !
Fun fact: My mom was in Turkey at the American embassy trying to get her visa to come to the US. All the embassies closed that day because it was September 11, 2001. Fortunately, my mom did eventually get her visa.
congrats!
OMG CONGRATULATIONS!!!! IVE NEVER CLICKED ON A VIDEO SO FAST!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
It made sense and congratulations on having the interview.
Ummm weren’t you just a little baby like yesterday? 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️ With so much love congrats!
MY FAV SIMMER IS ENGAGED IM SO HAPPY FOR U
Finally someone who understands the struggle of getting to the US during a pandemic. My J1 visa finally got approved... after a year of waiting...🎉 All the best to you and Dan! 🥰
wow, that's great news! congratulations to you and Dan on getting an appointment date! I'll have my fingers crossed for the process to go smooth from now on!
Wow, I didn't even know you guys were engaged. I got married at 21 as well, so I am not judging even a little. A lot of people told us we were too young, but it's been almost a decade and we're still happily married. I wish you guys all the best and look forward to future updates. And I couldn't imagine having to go through the pandemic living alone. I had a very different problem where I have 3 kids to drive me up the wall.
OH YM GOS CONGRATS IM SO HAPPY FOR YOUUUUU
Congratulations!!!!!!!!  We love you guys and hope that everything is PERFECT
it feels like my best friend just got engaged and im so stoked
God i’m crying hard right now. I’m so so so happy for you guys! I love you Kayla❤️
Congratulations! I’m so excited for you both!
this makes me so happy :)
Very happy for you.
Lmao you’re blowing up on tiktok and everyone thinks you’re 12
Yayyy!!!!
Omg I had no idea you were engaged! Congratulations! 🥳🎉🎊 I love your videos so much! Have a awesome day and I hope everything goes well.
..NO WAY YAY
Me (German) and my Canadian boyfriend  tried to get the fiance visa as well, but Germany requires that we have a wedding date set and we didn't really wanted that. I hope that works for you both.
Congrats!
Aw! I’m so happy for you!😁
So like I get that you don’t have a proposal proposal w a ring & stuff but how did you get to being fiancés? Just kinda decided?
europe is not a country ...😅
Congratulations on your engagement! And I am so happy that you and Dan are going to see each other very soon again! <3
On the one hand, I'm so happy for you, especially knowing how much you guys worked for this,  On the other hand, this makes me incredibly depressed and envious because I was engaged for four years and my fiance abused and cheated on me and I haven't been able to date since because of a crippling fear of intimacy...
duckdan the florida the man
This is so wholesome! I’m so happy for you and Dan! Congratulations on the engagement!  Do any of you know if the process is the same for same sex couples?
me scrolling through the comments making sure no one is saying anything mean... twitch chat community has your back kayla
I’m so happy for you ❤️❤️
CANGRATS KALYA
Ok but can we talk about how good her eyebrows are like 😼 also congrats 🥳👏
Just saw this and am literally speechless my jaw just dropped to the floor
Congratulations Dan and Kayla! Hope everything goes smoothly for you both!
Three times a day (or more) in Kayla's Twitch chat: "OMG is that an engagement ring????" Kayla (internally): I wish, I really do wish Kayla (out loud): It's not even on the right finger! Calm down! I'm not engaged Kayla (internally): *screaming*
Congratulations 🎉 I wish you two all the luck and blessings of the world.
OMG KAYAK CONGRATS Ps.: I’m your age and can’t imagine getting married yet, it’s awesome to see!!
I’m happy for you both. ❤️
"I can't wait not to be alone anymore"...Oof. Same. I moved to be closer to my boyfriend last year, which was my first time moving away from my family and out of their house. All to end up alone in my own place due to the pandemic and me being a teacher in a school that has been in person this whole school year. And boyfriend being a caretaker for his high risk of health complications parents. To limit the exposure risk for them, we haven't really been able to be together like we would have liked and it sucks. I just got my second vaccine shot though and boyfriend is getting his second in a few days. We'r finally in that home stretch after a very hard year...So, yeah, I felt that. Congrats you two! Hoping for the best!
I love how kayla is like: "yeah, I'm engaged, BUT DID YOU KNEW WE _SUED_ THE *GOVERNMENT? THAT WAS **_D O P E_*
I’m in the same but also opposite situation where we’ve applied for my American boyfriend to move to me in Sweden, but we applied this January so no one’s even looked at it yet and because of COVID I haven’t seen him in person since summer of 2019 because I couldn’t get that Christmas off work and....the waiting with no news is killing me
The thumbnail is why I just adore you so much and I'm so happy for you both <3
I'm so happy for you!! Congrats!
I'm so happy for you guys! I had no idea how complicated that process was.
europe is not a country, its a continent... germany, france that are countries, not europe ... XD
LETS GOOO
PERIOD SIMSIEEEEEE! I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!
Omg yay!!!! So happy for you both! 💖💖💖
Cannot believe you will be getting married this year!!! Congrats! 🥳 so glad your separation is about to be over 🤗
When did she get engaged???
Congratulations
Out here talking about her engagement like she's telling us her grocery list.
Omg, congratulations!!, 🎊❤️🎉
Omg I didn’t even know you was engaged, congratulations on this and the progress on the visa!
Congrats Kayla!!! I'm so happy for you guys!!
His interview is on my birthday! Hopefully extra good birthday vibes will be sent
yall should have a youtube wedding where you wear the hotdog suit and dan wears a duck costume
Yey!!!
I’m with you, girl!  I’m not waiting for a fiancé visa, I’m waiting for international adoption processes. Some countries have very limited allowances, but many do not. I was so close to bringing my daughter home, and now I can’t do anything.  Skype is not the same at all.
Oh, to be an immigrant in the US. I moved to Florida back in 2012 when I was 12 from South America. I’m thankful that I was young and I only had to see a very similar process from the “outside” because I could tell the stress, time, and money it took on my parents to move countries. It’s as you said not as easy as many people might think and there are a lot of factors and LOTS of paper work involved.   Within that year my whole family got our green cards and within five years we could apply for citizenship which I got back in 2018. Which is another process that involved, time, paperwork, and tests. We’ve been living here for the past 9 years and we all became naturalized US citizens!
i really went :o congratulations!!! im hoping for a dramatic sims reenactment of the wedding
Congratulations to the both of you!!
Hi
WE MISSED A COUPLE STEPS HERE, BUT CONGRATS I'm so happy for you guys <3
CONGRATULATIONS ❤😭😭❤❤❤❤❤
OMG CONGRATULATIONS
I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED THE VIDEO I'M STILL WATCHING THE AD BUT CONGRATS😭😭😭😭😭
Girl, i feel you on the long distance relationship, not been able to see my boyfriend since february 2020 because of the travel ban ^^; Its definitely complicated. But god that whole process is a full mess. But congratulations!! ^^
i watched kayla since the susan days and she only had a couple thousand subs, i was like 11 when i started watching her sims let’s plays and now i’m 16 and she’s engaged! wow :)
Congratulations
Omg congratulations!!! AAAAAA
Congrats Kayla, I'm so happy for you.
congrats, kayak! immigration can be such a pain but its so worth it in the end! I went the other way a few years ago and lived in the UK. Once everything is finally settled, it's like a sigh of relief.
OMG  Contrats  I love you i dident even nos Hhhhhhh
😍
Congratulations, Kayla!
Kayla!! congrats on all your hard work finally getting results omg, you must be so excited 🥺💛 also your outro sounds like that Reductress article that’s like “‘Sorry I’m Rambling,’ Woman Says Repeatedly after Making Extremely Concise Points” (same)
we been knew
KAYLA HOLY SHIT
If I can give you an advice is maybe don't tell the Internet where Dan is going to quarantine if he does, or tell us afterwards. Safety first :)
Whoopwhoop congratulations 🥰🥳
OMGGGHHLG
KAYLA YESSSS <3
im very excited for you two! i hope everything goes well!!!
so many comments are like “i didn’t even know she had a boyfriend!” and i’m out her watching streams everyday like >:)
kayla's brain knows 2 things: play sims & US immigration
CONGRATS omgggggg
How was the proposal? Was it just like a conversation where you both decided wanted to get married?? Or how was it? I'm sorry if it's too personal I'm just a sucker for this stuff😭💕
Me watching this whole thing even though I know exactly how the story goes and what is happening akusjbdflkasjdb
Congrats!!!!
I can not believe seeing her graduate 2 times and now this time flyes so fast
Congratulations! You said that you would prefer to live in the UK, can I ask why? I'm just interested, my cousin married an American and they moved here, but she used to talk about moving back. They have children now and I think maybe they won't.
Congratulations 🍾🎉
WHAT?!!? Who was gonna tell me that you were ENGAGED??!!
kinda crazy that kayak is gonna be married omg that’s so cool
Okay but when did you get engaged and decide you would get married and that he’d come to America? Tell us about the romanceeee
I knew it was gonna happen! Everyone I know is getting engaged in quarantine
Congratulations to you and Dan! So happy for you guys! Safe travels to Dan when the time comes and I hope the rest of this visa process goes by quickly for you two. 💜💜💜
This must feel like waiting for an Amazon parcel but like a million times worse 😓
are you getting married just so he came move over??
Its odd that yall look alike, like brother & sister. Someone needs  to change a facial feature
my family in bosnia has been waiting to get their visas for 10 years...it takes much longer to move to the US from a third world country
CONGRATS KAYLA AND DAN!😁😃💖👩‍❤️‍👨
YAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAY
YEAH YEAH KAYLA IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU YAYAYYAYAYAYAYA
when you mentioned brazil I was like... *cries in brazilian*  anyway back to the point CONGRATS!!!!! aaaaa this is so cool
I was lucky enough to have already moved in with my fiance before the pandemic started so props to you for getting through this stupid-long pandemic pretty much completely alone. I can't imagine. Good on you :)
Congratulations!!!
CONGRATULATIONS IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU
Im very happy for you and Dan! My mom's immigration has process has been lengthy and has gone on for about ~20 years now and cost my family hundreds of thousands of dollars, since she has been deported for the past 17 years and counting - I know exactly what u are feeling having a loved one far away and being under all the stress of the US immigration system. Good luck with everything and I hope you face no more roadblocks along the way <3
CONGRATS KAYLA!! :' )
Congratulations love!! <3333
my school has kinda taken over my life since the summer and im literally so out of touch so much has happened omg,, CONGRATS !?!!!?1?!
I'm so happy for you guys!
Congrats! Happy for you and Dan ❤️
you thinking the lawyer thing was a scam when you've had to pay thousands of dollars just to apply, submit & interview for the visa, that's the real scam
Sorry for my ttpos.
Congrats Kayla! ❤️
Congratulations I’m happy for you
so i know dan wont be able to work in the first stages of the visa process but what about twitch streaming? does that count as working?
I cannot imagine having to go through that process, but I'm so happy for you two that things are finally moving forward!!
Court house weddings are totally special too! If you're a big party person, awesome. If you're a intimate small wedding person, that's totally awesome too. We had a court house wedding and that's what worked for us. Weddings are fun, but it's the marriage and starting your life together that's the most fun/important part. Congrats!
They look like siblings 💀
congratss
Congratulations ❤!!!
OMGGGG
Congratulations Kayak 💕💕💕☘️☘️☘️ so happy for you two 🎉⭐️
They look alike thats how you know its for real cause they say you start to look like the one you love
The last time you posted a video with a similar title it was a joke! Congrats Kayla!
AHHH OMG IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU🙄☝️
Am I....crying?
not me thinking you’re 17🏃🏼‍♀️💨
Not hype to eventually go through that process! My partner lives in Switzerland and I’m in the uk - the plan is for me to move there once I’m done with uni but oh Lordy that doesn’t sound like a fun process
Sooo happy for u <3
Congrats ! ! !
will dan be able to post on youtube and stream when he moves or is he not allowed legally because he earns money that way?
Not hype to eventually go through that process! My partner lives in Switzerland and I’m in the uk - the plan is for me to move there once I’m done with uni but oh Lordy that doesn’t sound like a fun process
Lil Simse,tgis makes sensr. Although, imagune having to take in tjr concideration of ssi,ssdi, and other medically connected things. Due to those and the ADA  there are many limits one muat feal with.  Thabks for doing your page. I wish you good luck.
Kayla: I’m excited and I’m sure a lot of people don’t care about the process though Me: yes. I took immigration law classes. Wish I could have helped you.  But congratulations!
I'm so happy for you ❤❤
Yooooo, June 29th is my birthday! Congrats!
MY HEART I CANT
Wow she's 12 and getting married
OMG KAYLA YOURE ENGAGED AHHHH
SORRY WTF I MUSTA MISSED A CHAPTER I LITERALLY SCREAMED
I remember when she was in high school this is so cute
I'm so happy for you Kayak! Congratulations! All the love ❤
I'm not surprised how committed Kayla is to getting her engagement photos considering the mass amount of screenshots she takes for her sims proposals😂
Can’t wait for video titles like “fixing MY HUSBAND’s builds” etc! SO HAPPY FOR SIMSIE AND DUCK!! 🥰💓 I’ve been watching since the suzan rants in high school and now you’re getting married 🥲❤️
💜💜💜
Im so happy for you!!!!!!!
I would just like to say that I would love to one day get a video with Dan's commentary on the screen at random intervals. I feel like that would be tremendously funny :D
OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG CONGRATSSSSKSSKKSKDKDD
I’m so happy for you!Congrats!💍❤️
Congratulations on finally moving forward with this process! I've known quite a few people who have immigrated to the U.S. and it is definitely more complicated than what most people initially expect. I wish you both the best of luck moving forward, and hopefully in a couple of months you two can be reunited after what has been a long and crazy year.
!!!! I had to double check that today was not April 1st anymore! I'm so excited for you! Congrats! 💖
ive grown up with her and now shes getting married,, my heart 😭🖐
You could literally talk for hours and hours about your life in the US and I would never get bored! I'm so glad Dan is going to be able to join you - fingers crossed that everything goes smoothly now for you both. 🤞😁 I was wondering why you weren't coming to the UK, so I'm glad you explained that 😂 I wish you could move over here too, but you'd probably regret it fast since our weather here is abysmal! 😂
not Kayak, a 14 year old, getting a husband
‘so my boyfriend- my FIANCÉ’ YOU CANT DO IT THAT SUDDENLY KAYAK IM FRAGILE
Congrats!!! So happy for you & Dan!💕
Congratulations my dear! ❤️
Omg! I can’t believe it! Congratulations! I wish you and your fiancé a happy life together ❤️❤️❤️
congrats 🎉🎈🎊 :D
Wait was I supposed to know she was engaged?
"People ask how much does this cost? Well it adds up quick". And she's right. She didn't even account for the cost of the work permit which is $475 for every two years until you manage to get a green card instead. So given what she already mentioned, I imagine this whole process (excluding plane ticket and such) can end up costing well above $5000
Wooooaaah! I'm so happy for you! Congratulations!
CONGRATULATIONS KAYLA!!!!
Ah this makes so much sense.... I am currently in a similar predicament with my husband... however I have applied for a Canadian permanent residency within the country and we are also married which helped... we came to canada last march and then after 6 months we applied for 4 different applications.... my visitor extension, my work permit and my PR and then my husbands sponsor application.... it took 7 months for them to extend my visitor status I asked for a year they took 7 months so now I only have 5 months.... still waiting for everything else... we did get some progress where I have to give my biometrics now... but yeah like yours our costs about 2000 cad... Quite the year to be immigrating for sure hehe
Good Luck Kayla !!!! Sending positive vibes for you and Dan !!! Hoping the travel bans are lifted very soon 🙏
The embassy wants to give him a vibe check before he comes to the US
Congratulations 🎊🎉🥳 my sister recently got engaged to literally last weekend 😂
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU 💛💛
congrats! im so happy for you! i totally want a guided tour of your pinterest wedding board (we all know we all have one!) haha lots of love<3
So happy for you Kayla!! This is amazing news!!
I want to see more about a genuine couple going through the K1 process! 90 Day Fiance makes it seem like a totally different thing. I would like to know the reality behind it.
YAAAAAAYY!!! CONGRATULATIONS!!
Congrats, Kayla! I hope he gets here before your birthday. 🤞🏻
I’m not going to cry I’m not going to cry
So when the chat said he gonna propose to you (while discord call) he wasn't so much wrong.... 🤭
It’s crazy how you and a lot of your fans grew up together and now we are all similar ages and going through similar things. So happy for you Kayla, been here awhile💛
Congratulations Kayla!!! I am so happy for you. I love Dan and i love you. I know this is the best thing for u both. YAYAYAYAY MY 2 FAV STREAMERS ARE GETTING MARRIED!!!!!!

Congrats for your engagement, I'm so happy for you!!
omg kayla i kind of grew up with you, have been watching since 2017 aaand i think this is only my second comment on your channel so far hahaha, sorry not much of a comment-person. anyway been here since the good old susan story days, naming the fish in your 100 baby challenge, 14yo kayak, etc. so crazy to see how far you've come and matured! congratulations to you and your fiancé (: greetings and love from germany
I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!!!
Ahhhh congrats!!
Congrats
KAYLAAA YESSSS!!!!!
How can you have a fiance at 14 ??
I would love if kayla did more vlogs
Congrats!
I wish all the best to you two! So... how does it work for someone without the intent of marriage to move to the us? Does anyone know? That question just came to mind watching :)
So happy for you and Dan, Kayla!
OMG Congratulations!!!!
Congratulations to you both! It really feels like we've grown up together, also you and Dan are an adorable couple!  My wedding was scheduled for November 2020, it was cancelled because I'm stuck in Japan and my fiancé is in France. It's pushed back to November 2021, fingers crossed this panoramic situation gets better 🤞🏻
YAYYYY!!!
Me: Sees title Also me : OMGOMGOMGOMGAGUHBJYNJKAMIOKJ
I've been watching streams so this was all pretty much stuff I had already heard, but I'm still very interested learning how it all works.  I don't live in the US and before Brexit I thought if and when my gf and I would decide to move together it'd be easy but now I doubt it'll be as easy. (And that's years from now anyway. They still have university stuff to finish.) This video made me cry though. I'm so happy that you're getting everything sorted and maybe there's still hope that I'll get to see my gf in the future.
3 years ago I applied for a VISA to move to the UK (long story I'm from AUS, he had an accent, you know) and the process is so crazy and unknown until its all happening - I feel your pain. I can't imagine going through this during a pandemic! I booked my flight and quit my job, literally guessing when the VISA was going to be processed, and low and behold I rolled out onto Heathrow and it's all worth it. Long distance is stupid, I'm so happy for you that stuff is finally happening!
omg congrats gurl🥺💜
Everytime I see Kayla I feel like im a watching a 17yo but then remember shes older tan me for like 2years Feels weird and exciting to see her being engaged!
My parents both immigrated to the US from South Africa in 1994, but they only got their full citizenship in 2007. I'm so excited for you and Dan, and I wish y'all the best of luck!
Super exciting! I can't wait!
I’m so happy for you guys!!!!!!!!!!!
Title: i'm engaged Me: waiiit, nightmare legacy challenge episode isn't supposed to be released today 👁️👄👁️
Yayyy I amam so happy for you
Congrats!
As a Brazilian, it REALLY HURTS to hear Brazil is banned from the US knowing that it happened because of our dumb ass president
So happy for you two ☺️💖✨!
Congratulations!! I'm so happy for you and Dan!!
OMG OMG OMG! congrats!
OMG KAYLA CONGRATS!!!!!
I am so happy for you! Thank you for explaining visa process, it was very interesting!
Do the wedding at The Sims
y’all better make a lil wedding video pleade
My husband and I are still in this process almost 4 years later (he's Turkish, his circumstances were a little different). I am so glad someone else is explaining not only how complicated it is, how the pandemic has affected it, but how stressful and all-consuming it can be.
"so i basically sued the government :)"
OMG
i’ve been watching this girl since she was in HIGH SCHOOL
Congrats lil girl. Be sure to wear that hot dog suit on the wedding. Lots of happiness for you two :)
Not me just figured out you’re engaged
Congratulations!! Thank you for taking the time to share this exciting and personal journey! I've been married to my German husband as an American for 20 years now and the immigration process was crazy difficult! I can only imagine trying to do it during Covid. Best of luck to both of you! 🥰
I went through the same process right before covid, in 2019. I got here at the very end of December and got married in February 2020 before  the whole covid in the US. if you need any assistance for the GC process I'd love to help. I did the whole process with no lawyer (to avoid spending too much money) and it worked out!!! Funny I live in FL just like you haha, anyways good luck! The interview it will be super fine, they asked me about how we met and just "confirm" things that we already put in our first petition.
Since when you are engaged 🙂??
I saw this and almost screamed!!!
omg yayyyyyyyy awwwww
WHAT
I wish you a smooth visa and boarder entry process, I moved from one EU country to another before brexit to be with someone. I know how terribly you must miss Dan. One day you will be together and all the hurdles jumped will have been worth it. We spent five years apart and together for an additional 15. Good luck Lilsimsie and DuckDan XX
Clicked for the engagement, stayed for the life update/information, because you never know who is going to need to know this stuff. So glad you're making it through and CONGRATS to you and Dan!!!
Oh my God you're growing up so fast I'm so proud
Congratulations!
Congratulations!!!   I recently had to go through getting a Danish residence permit based on family reunification to be with my boyfriend at the time and our daughter in Denmark & it was a nightmare. I applied in January 2020 in the US (this was my 3rd application & the other 2 times I applied in Denmark, but I got a lawyer to appeal the decision & they were terrible & pretty much did nothing). Anyways my application was rejected in September because they said we haven't lived together for 18 months (you either have to be married or have been living together and we have been living together since November 2015 before our daughter was born so we thought it was fine). We decided let's just get married so we appealed the decision, got married in December 2020, and my residence permit was finally approved in February 2021.
OMGGGGG
You are young and rich I hope this is genuine omg bc u deserve the world please be smart about this
Congratulations!!!!!!🍾🎉🎊🎈
i've been admiring this part of kayla and dan's life for ages now and honestly this news has just made my year bc i cant even begin to empathise with how you both must feel and to know that theres a moving date in sight is just so great... im sending all my love and fingers crossed energy to hope this process goes smoothly & quicker for you both! <3
I'm glad progress is being made. So happy for you too!
Congratulations on your engagement!  I have been watching you since my little petshop, back in the day so it has been wonderful to see your milestones!  I am so happy for you and Dan!!
OMG I never knew Kayla was engaged!?!?!? Congrats 🎉🎉
CONGRATULATIONS LILSIMISE IS GOING TO BE MRS.lilsimise❤️
Super duper happy for you and Dan. I’ve got everything crossed that it goes as smoothly as it possibly can and I cannot wait for Dan and Simsie videos/streams :)
Congratulations! 👏🎉💗🍾 Also now Brexit has happend are we still classed as EU in USA's eyes? Dunno if the policies have been updated yet 🤷‍♀️ But congrats, and a pre-moon (Quarantine) in Mexico would be awesome 😘 xxx
names countries that are banned “brazil” okay yes country “china” okay yes country “europe” no it’s a continent lilsimsie
Congratulations, you two!
So happy for you and Dan. <3
CONGRATULATIONS!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA IM SO INCREDIBLY HAPPY FOR YOU!!!! CONGRATULATIONS AND I HOPE YOU TWO HAVE LOTS OF HAPPY TIMES TO COME
you and dan deserve this so much <3 i'm so happy for you both
Congrats!!! Ngl I kinda thought it was an April fools prank but I’m very happy for u!!
Congratulations, long distance is so hard. I’m sorry it’s such a long process for you especially with the pandemic but at least it’s near the end now!
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH YAY
I feel so happy for them and couldn't stop smiling the whole time!!  It's been a rough year for everyone and I'm so glad to see that some things are finally looking up : )   and I just KNOW they'll have the best hug ever when they'll see each other again
WHAAAAAT!!!!!!! OMG, congratulations 😍😍😍 I am so happy for you 😍😍❤❤
OMFG 😭😭😭😭😭😭
So sweet But I have a question you ones made a video wehre you build your dream house but didn't finish it. So you let us finish but didn't come back to it. Could you please do soon🙏😢☺️
I'm so excited for you both! I wish there was something we could do to speed up the process. I watch Dan now all the time, you guys are adorably similar, he's picked up a lot of your mannerisms haha
You'd think that she'll post engagement pics and then she says 'We'll get married in the courthouse day after he comes here' classic Kayla, that's why we love her. Lot's of love from Poland (currently one of the worst countries to be during covid-19) 🇵🇱♥️♥️
EXCUSE ME WHAT, HOLY SHIT,  CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!
i thought this was april fools and then realised i am a day late
Awww congrats Kayla and Dan🥺❤️ wishing you the best of luck on the process of getting the visa🤞🏾🤞🏾  In the meantime, I'mma go save Dan's interview date on my calendar so that I'll remember😂😂
I am so happy for you!! My aunt and uncle just recently got a visa green card etc and I know its a hard process but the reward is so worth it!!
wtf when did you get engaged im so lost
Meanwhile me at 21 still scared to make a doctor appointment
Congrats!
wtf you're engaged
YOOO
Funny comparison.. my Australian partnership visa costs $7000 (in 2019 atleast) plus on top $4000 lawyer fees.....i wish i only had to pay $4000ish dollars total instead...
ALERT ALERT THIS US NOT A DRILL
kinda fun that i live in a place that sueing the governament is normal
Congrats!!!
The "90 Day Fiance" Had me screaming 🤣🤣🤣
I saw the thumbnail and I started crying, I'm so happy for you!!!!! <3
Congrats Kayla!!!
we watched her grow up now shes engaged im so proud
I had no idea simsie was engaged, or had a car. ppppst I wouldn't mind living alone right now...I did it for 6 months while my husband was in basic training and I LOVED it.
'Some countries, like, eUrOpe' 👁👄👁. Gongratz anyways ❤❤
this whole process makes me realize how unromantic marriage technically is
Kayla - can I ask .... have you considered moving to the UK? We have the NHS!
😀
@Vixella
So interesting how some people would rather move to the US. My sister's husband if from England as well, and she chose to move there instead of him moving here. They have an extensive marriage visa program too. They had to provide a lot of paperwork and have a lot of check-ins. I think they're on the last check-in part where there's like 5 years in between the most recent check-in and the last one and then after that, shes formally a citizen.
All the best for the future, may the two of you be together soon.
Me seeing the notification: Wait whaaaat?!?!?!
OH MY GOSH!!!! i was on the bus when i saw this and i started screaming!!!!🤩💖🥳
Congrats kayla I'm so excited for you!!!!!! Wholesome bean
ok but you're keeping your last name right? 😂  genuine congrats though hope things run much more smoothly
congrats!!!
In France, we’re always complaining about our institutions and their complicated processes... when I watch this video, I am relieved that we’re all having the same issues lol
Congrats Kayla!!!!
I have never clicked a video so fast, Danny GAMEzales can wait
Never been more proud of a twelve year old 🥺🥺🥺
So incredibly happy for you kayak, youve done so much work on this I hope you enjoy it all paying off!!
By July (when he'll have the visa) England will hopefully be highly vaccinated (I'm 18 and projected to have it around August/September time last I checked) so logistically I assume the travel ban may be lifted, or lifted for those who have be vaccinated which Dan will be offered before it expires at least? Right? Anyways, I hope it all goes smoothly :))
Omg so complicated.... happy for you!  😁
Congratulations, glad you will be together soon ❤️
OMG congratulations 🤩🤩
CONGRATS SIMSIE! so happy for youuuuuuu <3
Congratulations!! That kind of paperwork is awful xx I hope everything works out x
please please please go on 90 day fiance! Lol love that show and it is starting to suck so a lil simsie story line is just what I need!!!!
Congratulations to you both 😁
As someone who has moved from UK to US, we are STILL waiting, and its been 10 years 😭😭
i’m so happy for you kayla
IM ABOUT OT CRY OMG AHHHH YOUR ACTUALLY GETTING MARRIED!
Im not crying I just have something in my eye. So happy for you!
CONGRATS!!!
Yay!! Congrats
Congratulations! I almost went through the same thing, but it was too much for my boyfriend and he decided that the distance between us was too much.  I wish you and Dan the best! Tell him the saying: "Happy Wife, happy life!" My co-worker has that up in his office. His wife embroidered it and framed it for him. 🤣
AHHHH SO HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS!
congratulations oh my god I’m so happy for you guys 🥺❤️ this video made me so emotional, so much that you guys are going through just to be with your person. I’ll appreciate being with mine extra today after watching this. best of luck to you guys 💞💞
UM WHAT HOW IS KAYLA, A 14 YEAR OLD NARCISSIST ENGAGED???
Wait....whaat
Congrats simsie!
OMG SIMSIE TLC SHOW ??  edit: also omg congrats!!
If all goes well lockdown restrictions should be mostly gone by June 21st so hopefully he will be able to come to the use by the time he gets the visa!!
Congratulations!!!🤗😄💖👏
congratulations Kayla! I'm so happy for you!!
I grew up watching you, keep in mind I am also 21... And I really feel like a high-school 'friend' got engaged! Congratulations! So happy for you two I hope he gets there before your birthday, or they ease the restrictions!  -smo11koa1a on twitch
The fact they don't teach this stuff in schools...🤔
Kayak out here getting married at 12, kids move so fast these days😔
Why would someone economically stable or whatever move to the us? You should move to the uk instead, you’re just making the sims videos. Congrats by the way.
I am not that good in englisch what did she say summarized. I dont mean it mean. I hope yk what I mean
Yayy!! So many congratulations to you and Dan!! Living together is awesome 🎉🎉🎉
KAYLA!!!! Congrats!!🥰
OH MY GOD ??????????????????????????????????????? OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG ????????????????????
congrats
this is so exciting but also really depressing- there are so many more people who can’t afford to do this, or whose wait list is way longer because they aren’t engaged to anyone, just trying to make themselves a better life
This video couldn't of been made at a better time, I have been wondering how the whole process of UK-US/US-UK really works and what the actual expectation vs reality is. I have been searching up this sort of stuff for my relationship of 4 years but honestly have been confused asf.. I'm going to show this to my bf so ty for sharing your story it actually helps us... also Congrats!
Congraaats!!! 🥳🥳❤️❤️❤️
I'm so happy for u two! I just hope that you can actually bring a symbolic cowplant to the courthouse :D
I can't say "omg i can't believe it" cuz let's be honest who wouldn't want to marry Kayla? but seriously so happy for you!!!
You're getting married! How wonderful. So happy for the two of you.
Congratulations!  The whole application process sounds like a big headache lol
when did this happen-  like a day ago kayla was 14 years old building suburban blue houses
so happy for you simsie!!! hope everything works out <3
Congrats!!!
My best mate is moving to the us with this on the law suit to
I'm so happy for you guys! Good luck, it's a huge change for both of you, but stick in there!
Yay! Kayla - congratulations to you both. 🥳this is awesome! I understand how complicated it is—I emigrated to the US in 2001 and became a citizen in 2014!
So happy for you two!!!😊 don’t know if it’s a weird question but how did you guys get engaged? Did you two just talk about it and agree that you’d wanna get married? I’m not sure how the whole getting engaged part works when you are long distance... especially since you can’t exactly get down on one knee and ask
Omg
YAYYY IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU 🥰
I’m so happy for you Kayla!
congrats mrs and mr simsie 💖
CONGRATS KAYLA I’m so happy for you and Dan!!
Took me a moment to process this because I genuinely think of you as a teenager not an actual woman😭
Congratulations! So happy for you!
so annoying that a personal video gets less views than the gaming ones
Has anyone ever told you that you have sanpaku eyes?
*le gasp*
That was pretty obtuse that that the government would only process the plaintiffs.  The lawyers are laughing, what a money grab.

How are you getting married with 12 years old?
My mom is still waiting for the offices to apply so she could move to the UK. Since Covid happened the one of only 3 offices in Canada has been closed and she's been stuck here waiting. Mom literally married her husband in the UK late November 2019. I hope they open for her soon. Good luck with your visa with your hunny Kayla. Congrats~
this was so interesting to hear about!! congratulations to you both ❤️
I’m not sorry for getting butterflies hearing fiancé in place of boyfriend, I’m so incredibly happy for you both!
Europe is a continent, not country! Travelling restictions depend on particular countries in Europe, so it's not like the whole Europe is banned from traveling to the US.
CONGRATS KAYAK IM SO HAPPY FOR YOUUU!!! I HOPE EVERYTHING GOES WELL💞💞
Actually I'm a 15year old german kiddo who like to watch your sims-videos (btw your a really funny and kind person) and never comment. But now is the day where I leave a comment and I congratulate you. Even it is not my luck it just makes my day better.

So young to get married.   I really hope it all works out!  It's sad how expensive this whole process is and how long it takes under normal circumstances,  let alone during this whole pandemic situation.  Absolutely crazy. Atleast you'll see eachother soon,  if all goes as planned.  It's hard being apart for so long

I am so happy for you omgggg i'm literally crying
Do you know much about the CR1 visa process?
Congratulations Kayla and Dan!!!!!
I’m only 10 seconds into the video but Congratulations! 🎉
Congrats Kayla on your engagement!!! I love watching your videos. They are very entertaining.
I am so happy for you and Dan! Hopefully he can travel straight to the us when the time comes! Which cannot come soon enough
AHHHHHHHHH
Congratulations!! ❤
congrats!!!
My boyfriend is in Mexico and we haven't been able to see each other in 17 months. He has a tourist visa and we were planning on seeing each other often to see how things go. I'm looking into applying for something but taking those steps are really big. And immigration is so expensive and such a pain. We basically had to put everything on hold until people can travel normally again.
YES
Congrats simsie!
I am beyond happy for you both. I knew about it from Twitch but the update and new news is absolutely wonderful.  Congratulations to both of you and thank you for explaining all of that. Movies and shows portray it differently and I didn't know to what extent the pandemic truly impacted the process.  Good choice to lawyer up as I felt awful thinking it'd be years whenever it'd come up. Congrats again and now you can link this video in twitch chat to direct all of the "backseat" comments.  Hugs to you both. I'm rambling too, sorry.
This is awesome! I´m so happy for you and I hope he can move there soon! Just 1 thing, Europe is not a country, it´s a continent... Love your content though! <3
I'm obsessed with politics, political and human geography and for some reason immigration and travel things. So this... Oh my god, my favourite youtuber is also now an immigration policy and travel thingy whatever freak as well! That's great. Let's not use the word freak... let's say enthusiast.
I watched this even after hearing all of it on twitch and I’m still smiling like a weenie 😂 I’m so happy for you and Dan, Kayla ❤️
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thanks Kayla for sharing all of this with us, when you certainly did not have to. We care about you and Dan a lot as a community and I am beyond excited for this next step for you both!   With love, LovelyKatieKanna
Lol congrats?
Kayla I’m so happy for you! My parents had to do all of that visa stuff too, I know it’s a pain. Wishing you both the best of luck and happiness!
God I’m so happy for you simsie
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!!!💃🏻🕺🏻🤩✨🤗
congrats kayla im so glad that you got good news!! <3

Congrats!

Congrats bestie! So happy for you! ❤️

I AM SO EXCITED FOR YOU TWO!!!!
Of course, a huge, from the bottom of my heart, congratulations! I'm so happy that you both have the light at the end of the tunnel in sight and you're flying towards it quickly! The end of June will be here before you know it! I wish the both of you a lifetime of laughter, happiness, love, and joy!

Hi kayla! My British husband got his green card at the end of Feb 2019! If you have any questions about that interview or anything, let me know!! They asked a lot of questions about finances at that one and separated us, so my husband got pretty overwhelmed.
I don’t know why but thinking Kayla as a provider is funny to me.
I read this as "I am enraged" and was very surprised at the actual content of this video
Worst case scenario, Dan gets a two week Cancún vacation
OH MY GOD OUR GOOD LITTLE NOODLE IS SO GROWN UP, SHES GETTING ENGAGED!!! Congratulations!!
Kayla 2020: I graduated in a pandemic! Kayla 2021: I got engaged and applied for 90 day fiancée and participated in a lawsuit in a pandemic!   Congratulations Kayla and Dan!
Congratulations!
YAYAYAYAYA I am soooo happy for you!!!!!!!!!!!! I also remember you saying in one of your videos saying my boyfriend edits my videos and I have just been wondering I have never seen her boy freind NOW YOUR ENGAGED. What have I missed
Congratulations x
Congrats!!! Fingers crossed for you and Dan and it will work out for you guys and yeah those fun stuff can wait

HUH?? nice 👌👍
AHHHHHHHHHH
Congrats guys ♥
This is so exciting!!!!
CONGRATULATIONS KAYLA!!!!
thank you for explaining this! i too am dating someone from the uk and have been for awhile and we plan on living together and it is SO HARD
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH YOU DESERVE THE BEST
I'm not usually one to post comments, but congratulations!  The K1 visa is a monster to tackle, and I speak from experience. My now husband is also from the UK. We filed in November 2017 and we got married 19 days after he entered the country in October 2018. He really struggled with not being able to work while we waited for his EAD and AP, and then there was a delay with his actual green card BECAUSE SOMEONE DIDNT THINK BRITISH BIRTH CERTIFICATES WERE ISSUED IN ENGLISH (I'm fne, still bitter, but fine). In May, we'll be applying for his 10 year GC and I think this coming October we'll be able to apply for his citizenship.  It's a gruelling process, but what matters most at the end of the day is that you're with your loved one. Congratulations again! I know you both must be estatic!
Congrats!
Congratulations Kayla!!! I’m so excited for you!
I didn’t even know he’d proposed omg
Congrats!!! 💗💗💗
That was a truly interesting and informative video. I've had a couple Visas for the US before so I'm familiar with the process but I never really looked into that one. So different from what we see on TV and in movies!
get you someone who loves you enough to sue an entire government
I’ve heard in a couple of places that the travel ban is being lifted in the middle of June, I don’t know how credible the sources are but fingers crossed it is!🤞
WHAT OMG YAYYAYAYA
Congratulations KAYLA AND DAN! 💙😭
OMG CONGRATS KAYAK‼️
CONGRATULATIONS!!!! ❤🎉
I'M PROUD OF U
OMG NO WAY THE VISA STUFF IS MOVING!!! 😍 that‘s so great for you!
Make sure you tell Dan that he needs to take stamps with him, when he goes to the interview, so that they can post the passport and visa to him. In some cases they request them and it isn't on their list of required paperwork (better to be safe than sorry!!)
and shes like,oh yeah,i'm engaged btw
not me sat nearly crying because im so happy for you both :')
I literally just SCREAMED. Congratulations!!!!  Cupcake machine celebration???
i've already known this for a while but i still cried watching this
WAIT WHAT HOLD MY COWPLANT!!!!!!!! 🤯😱😱
Congratulations hopeing that Dan is able to travel soon! Blessings to you both!
how does a 12 year old like kayak get a fiance
I SCREAMED OMG CONGRATS!!1

I’m so happy for you and Dan! My best friend and her husband went through this whole process a couple of years ago so I know how stressful it is. I will keep you both in my thoughts.

I'm so excited to have another couple for my british boyfriend and I to look up to and so happy for you! <3
I honestly know how you feel- My husband is military and we got engaged while he was in Korea and I was in the USA. We got married six months later in my front yard, and then that week he moved to England without me. Six months after that (two lost passports later), the military approved me to move. It took another six months to get my car to England, after I got there. We were there for 2.5 years, now we back in the states. I’d rather be in the UK too, but I totally get it.
kaylaaaaaa!! what!! CONGRATS 😭😭😭
Congrats
OMG Congratulations. All the best for your new journey
Congratulations🥰
Now we understand Kayla’s random obsession with 90 day fiancé

One of my teaching partners went through this process to get her now husband here. It was a three/four year process for them along with $5000+ investment. Happily they have been married getting close to 10 years and have two gorgeous children. Wonderful family. So there are happy endings to all you are going through.
Kelly I'm so happy for you 💕😭
I’m not screaming, your screaming! I’m so excited for you! Congratulations love!
KAYAK IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU OMG
i cant be the only one who thought kayla was english
this isn’t quite the same but I applied to law schools 6-7 months ago and for 6-7 months i’ve been refreshing every school’s website daily to check my status. so painful!!!
Congrats and much support on doing what it takes to be together even when it isn’t the easiest or expected path. My sis-in-law got married at the courthouse a long time before having a reception because military deployment. My husband and I got married at townhall and I loved it. It was just our parents as witnesses and low-key and personal. We had planned to have a small reception the following year, (Family health issues that pushed us to have the legal ceremony sooner) but uh, I found out I was pregnant and the date we had picked was my due date. Sooo....we had a baby instead of party because I didn’t want to go into labor at my own reception. Now we are planning a vow renewal with celebration when we turn 50. Lol. Long term goals!
My birthday is on June 29th and now that I know that his interview will be then I‘m way more excited🥳
AHH CONGRATS KAYAK THIS IS SO EXCITINGGGG

Omgggg congratssssss 🥳🎉
i have literally been watching you since you were a teenager this is so weird oh my gosh (but congratulations! so happy for you)
My cousin married an American lady and the process for him to get over there was so long and drawn out. So many hoops to jump through. I don’t envy you guys. Congratulations though.
Kayla you make my day and your videos are so fun. I'm so happy that you are getting engaged. Because you make so many people happy so you truly deserve love and happiness you are an amazing person. And thank you for being happy! ❤

You should go and quarantine (?) with Dan in Mexico and have a nice pre-honeymoon! You could just rent a nice isolated Airbnb close to the beach, get groceries and everything delivered (so it’s safer) and then you can have your pretty engagement pictures and everything 💗

OMG CONGRATS!!!!!!!!!!!!  but also all this info and people still are all jUSt CoMe HeRe LeGaLlY!!!111!.......k1 applicants have to have met at least once, the us partner has to have above a certain income, non-us partner can't work for almost a year, hella money to just get the application going, possibly more if lawsuits become necessary................and people still getting mad a "illegal" immigration idk sounds a lil classist luv EDIT: also, a medical exam? like....america doesn't have universal healthcare so it's not like the government would pay for anything if the non-us partner was sick or s/t???
Holy I didn't even know you were engaged. Well this is so exciting.
OMG KAYLA CONGRATS 😍😍😭😭

My uncle has to go through the visa process again because of covid, and we’re still waiting for an interview date. It definitely sucks having the government in control of it :(
I'm *so so so* happy for both you & Dan! I can't imagine how stressful this whole process must've been! ♥
I’m so happy for you guys!! OMG Congratulations💕
I always forget how wild being in your early 20s is because like I’m a year younger than kayak but because she’s engaged I feel 10 years younger.
simsie looks like she is going to cry. bless her little sims hart. hope you are doing well in this challenging time be safe. from Corley :) x
Congratulations Kayla and Dan!!!

OMG CONGRATS KAYAK
on a completely unrelated note, your eye color is super cool
come quarantine in canada, bummer you can't move to the uk
Congrats I have super strict parents I finally found a woman I am in love with we are engaged and when the pandemics over we’re getting married now I know you’re probably thinking based on my other comments you’re only 17 when the pandemic is over I will probably be 25 and she is the same age as I am so it’s not like we’re rushing in a marriage or anything we’ve been dating since I was like 14 so we’ve been together for a while and we love each other and I’m glad that U2 love each other to
My wife and I went through the exact same process! She moved to the US from the UK and we have been married now for 4 years. She actually just got her 10 year green card after having her 2 year one. The amount of paperwork is INSANE. They need to know every single detail about your lives together. It's SO intense but SO worth it. So happy for you both, it's about to be amazing for you!!
OMGOMGOMG
Congrats xx 🥰💜
Our kayak is growing up!!!!
Kayak looks really pretty today and has really nice skin :)
Congrats! 😀
Also she was supposed upload yesterday but... People will think it was faked and blah blah when it ain't
how many people thought of andrew and amira from 90 day when kayla mentioned the quarantine loophole? anyways CONGRATS KAYLA AND DAN!! i hope the rest of the process goes as smooth and as painlessly as possible! ❤
No offense but the thumbnail looks like a siblings or dating pic
OMGGGGGG AAHHHH CONGRATS 🥺🥺

ahhh congrats!! me and my fiancée are september filers and still waiting for noa2. luckily my fiancée has been able to visit me in sweden a few times since we have "family exceptions" to our travel ban. hopefully our embassy opens soon, without too much backlog... we couldn't afford being plaintiffs anyway. :/  we tried to have her move to sweden instead because that immigration fee is like 500 usd total, but i lost my job because of covid soooo 'MURICA HERE I COME (maybe, who tf knows at this point)
Congratulations to you and Dan! Thank you opening up to all of us with the many, many processes that you both have to go through in order to have him come here to the U.S!
When I saw the title I screamed out loud! Congrats Kayla!!!
I'm so happy for you! Wishing you two the best!

You’ve gotten so far in the process, I can’t imagine how frustrated it must’ve been but here you are!! You’ve made ittt! Now I hope everything else falls into place and that you’ll finally be able to be happy together with your manss. 👏😌❤️

Me: * has no intentions of moving to US * Me listening to all the details about visa: 👁👄👁
congratulations kayla!!
CONGRATULATIONS QUEEN
Congratulations kayla 💖💖
my friend and her husband went through this process and got married a year or so ago now and it was so stressful for them even pre-covid! so happy for you both to get it sorted/updated!
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU! EEEEEE THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY
I wish you all the best. The visa paperwork is brutal! I truly hope you both can be reunited again soon ❤️  I struggled for visas for my husband for 7 years for him to be able to live in Canada (we met and married in Canada). We went to his country together and I returned thinking he would be granted a visa in 4 months. 22 months later I gave up everything and I moved across the world to be with him. After having a child in his country and witnessing so so much, my mental health fell apart. We made the decision that our daughter (2years old) and I would move back to Canada. He was finally granted a visa 1 year after being seperated and the next day his country shut down... by the summer he told me he doesn’t want to come here anymore. One fight after another and he still says he will never be happy here and blames me for my severe major depressive disorder... Our relationship has fallen apart. Now it’s been a year since his visa was granted and I have filed for divorce 😭 My daughter and I haven’t seen him in 843 days...  Sorry to vent here. Today is a difficult day 💔
THE video we have been waiting for. Congrats to both of you!!!
This made me cry!!! it made me think of all what I went trough with my bf, living apart, and getting everything ready to move together!! we are so happy for you
I’ve been watching your videos here on YouTube since we were in high school so it’s mind blowing seeing you getting engaged. Wow
Congratulations🥳
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH congrats
Omg that’s suuuch great news!!
Congrats Kayla and Dan
Congrats I’m so happy for you two!!!
no you don't understand, I was taking a sip of water, got the notification and LITERALLY did a spit take. my textbook is all wet. apparently it's been longer than I thought since I watched the stream
AHHHHHH KAYLA CONGRATS ILY
Congrats. Maybe you could go together to Mexico when Dan is waiting enter US.  Like 2 weeks pre honeymoon.  Or any non Europian country.
OMG CONGRATSSS
no no no no, u were a senior in high school...... NOW U ARE ENGAGED!??
im gonna cry omg kayak-
Visa processes are classist and I'm glad Kayla gets to live with her fiance and anyway freedom of movement and residence ✌🏼
Europe is not a country... 🤣 Every time!
Congratulations!!
"You probably don't know about the Visa..." Amm lol I didn't even know she was engaged, just that she had a boyfriend but I am so happy for the both of you and congratulations!!!!
I can't believe people are putting thumbs down on your engagement Kayla I'm so happy for you!!!
I feel for you both so much. I lived in France for 4 months, and the student visa was SO much easier to get, and yet it was stressful af. They even made me do the medical tests after I got there, including the tuberculosis lung scan, so I'd been in the country 3 months and potentially spreading tb for like 3 months by the time I tested negative for it lmao.
I so hope that by your bday you have him by your side. That would be so nice.
You’d be surprised how much the government gets sued and loses. The US government loves to create unnecessary conflict because of how much power they have and they get sued pretty frequently.
HMMM for now you could have a weddin in the sims 👀
Omg 😭🥺 congrats ❤️
kayla you're only 21 whats the rush?
OMGGG CONGRATS, now I understand why you didn't want to post this yesterday
Congratulations, Kayla!! I'm so thrilled for you and Dan!!!
i really love your content and i can see in your videos and on twitch that you are an amazing person, im so so so happy for you and dan, you both deserve just the best things. I wish you two a very see each other soon c:
i am SO happy for you guys! congrats!!
Congratulations to u & Dan!!!!!!!😄😁
Congrats! Me and my partner are trying to do the same, except I'm UK based and it's actually now harder than the US process :(
I am so so happy for you!! It's time to be happy with your man sweetheart. Wish you both only the best 😘 love from the Netherlands!
congratulations
Honestly even if the travel ban is still on just go on vacation together
KAYYLAAAAAAAA AAAHHHHH
Today I am grateful to be part of the twitch audience, because I think my brain would explode if I didn’t know this information and I saw this video title in my feed. I was there for the Animal Crossing stream sometime last year when Kayla stopped in her tracks on her island, put down the controller, facepalmed, and said something along the lines of “OKAY CHAT, I’m just gonna say it. Dan and I applied for a K1 visa back at the start of this year. Let’s talk about what that means” and we all died of happiness
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU KAYLA! The whole process sounds like a nightmare so I’m so glad you’re seeing the light at the end of the tunnel ❤️
YOU ARE ENGAGED?!?!
I already live with my partner and we are engaged 💍
I never comment but I admire your talent and passion but this time I'll make an exception just to tell you that and also congratulations!!!!!
Just look How her eyes sparkle! Girl, I'm happy for you. Hope you'll hug your soulmate soon.
I was like "PLEASE DON'T BE A LATE APRIL FOOLS DAY PRANK"
OMG I‘m so excited ❤️❤️❤️ congratulations!!
CONGRATULATIONS KAYAK!!!

My mom and I immigrated to the US from Canada through a fiance visa. My mom married my stepdad when I was 12 and we moved to Minnesota. The whole immigration process was a nightmare and took us two years, I can't imagine what it's like with covid. I wish you guys the best of luck and congratulations.
YAY KAYLA! YAY DAN!

OH MY GOD
I wish I could thumbs up this a THOUSAND TIMES!
When Kayla sues the government to get her man.. an ICON!
what a shame hearing from simsie brazil is banned 💀💀
A friend of mine is pretty much in the same boat, we live in the UK and his girlfriend lives in Illinois, he's planning to move over to be with her, and since they haven't explained the process to us, its been confusing, but seeing this has made a lot of sense on why he's moving to the US, and she's not moving to the UK
OMG CONGRATSS🥳🥳I’m so happy for you😊
I couldn't click faster
CONGRATS 🥳🎉🎉🎉🎉
Congratulations I’m so happy for you!!!!! 😭🥰💙🙌🏻☀️😎

YAY!
Will DuckDan have to give up streaming whilst he’s waiting for a work permit to come through?
WAIT SHES ACTUALLY ENGAGED??!!!!!
Thought it was a prank but remembered that april fools was yesterday
I thought this was gonna be a sims 4 short lifespan series 😂
Omg if you don’t build your dream wedding venue in the sims I will not be attending the ceremony
Are u changing your last name from Sims
This is such great news :) so happy for you guys!!!
Aww I'm so happy for you Kayla!! If you ever feel pressured or anxious about planning your wedding and setting the date and at all jazz, hear me out....Ready?   You don't need to have a big, elaborate, instagramable wedding. This is the 2020s! One of the major struggles newly weds have during their first year of marriage is debt because they decided on taking out $50,000+ worth of loans to plan this ONE DAY event, plus week-long getaway at a private resort or whatever. My husband and I got married 3 weeks after I finished college back in May 2020. Due to the pandemic, we didn't want to run the risk of having people coming to our wedding and then get sick afterwards. We opted to just go down to the county clerk office to obtain our marriage license together, have a small civil ceremony to legalize our union, then get it processed in the records immediately afterwards. The best part? It only costed us less than $200 altogether. My parent did throw us a small party at their house to celebrate and take wedding photos, but overall we didn't go into debt. And now 10 months later, we moved to a new state, we have a house together, a brand new truck, two car titles in our names, we're both working adults, no kids (yet😉), and we're financially stable where we are now.  Moral of the story, do not get you and Dan into a situation that will cause a rift in your relationship. Keep it simple, affordable, and memorable. Other than that, I'm happy for the both of you and I wish you both the best!!💖
Okay, so according to TikTok you're getting married at 12...
Congratulations!
Awwww id love for you to come live in the uk some day!
She should have posted this yesterday as an April Fools joke turns out it was real
Congrats on engagement
I’m so happy for u girl!!🥰🥰🥰
OMG KAYLA IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU MY GOD
Just asking, can someone explain to me why in the comment section everyone is typing Kayak instead of Kayla 😂😂😂
Omg They are gonna get/are engaged!?  Congrats!!!
WHAT, CONGRATSSSS AAAAAAAA
Omg I didn’t k she was engaged. Omg ik this is late but congrats
my friend went on a study abroad trip to Wales & years later, let’s just say the wedding was beautiful 🤩 they spent thousands of dollars between visa application, medical/mental exams, travel to the London embassy, & to move across the Atlantic ocean.. EXPENSIVE congrats Kayla i’m so happy for you & dan 🥰
ak congrats Kayla!!!!
What?!? Omg congrats You know Kayla you’re the reason that I saved up money to buy the Sims and then saved up money to buy seasons and then realized I really liked cats and save that money to buy dogs and cats and so much more thank you and hope you have the best engagement ever??? I was really unsure and type in less sorry
OMGGGGGGGGGG
WHAT OMG
Wow i didn’t even know you were engaged! I just knew that he was your boyfriend! Congratulations❤️I’m so happy for u! I wish u guys a long and happy life together☺️🎊
Oh my god!! This is super exciting. My husband and I are currently going through the process of getting him a green card and it’s a long process. I’ll be happy to talk about it. Like you said it’s nice being able to talk to someone who’s going through the same process as you.
I read the title as “so.... I am enraged” 😂and I thought she was on 90 fiancé
You two deserve this and I'm very happy for you! Remember not to let over-enthusiastic fans pressure you into sharing more than you're happy with. I have a close friend with an online following who shared a lot about their wedding process and regrets not having kept it more personal for her and her fiance. Just certain pictures, plans, and videos were moments they would have rather enjoyed together personally and privately. It's more fun to engage with creators when they're comfortable and willing to share personal moments rather than feeling strong-armed into spilling details. You two are gonna be great!
Thank you for sharing this with us!!!!! I’m so happy this news finally came for you.  My boyfriend lives in the US but due to high risk family and family members working on the front lines I also haven’t seen him since February 2020. I know the feeling of being alone for basically the whole of COVID, so it’s nice for me to know that someone else gets what I’m living. I know it’s not the same but it helps me anyway. Sending you lots of good vibes <3
Omg congratulations!
wait stop why didn't i realize you were engaged........ idk what kind of visa i thought Dan was getting but this is still a shocker for me and i have been watching your twitch streams for months hahaha
I think you did a really good job at explaining all of this! It's a good video. Also: Congrats!!
Very happy for you! I hope things go well!
Congratulations, Kayla!
I'm sooooooo happy for you guys and thank you for sharing! 💖💖
ok but will your last name still be Sims this is important
Oh my god kayak is engaged fndnsn they grow up so fast
Can't believe 12 year old Kayak sued the government
You are positively glowing and I love it! I don’t think I have ever seen you look this happy and it really warms my heart. Very happy for you
OMFG
That’s so exciting 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Yay!! Congrats Kayla and Dan :) So happy for you two, and hopefully he's on his way to the US soon!!
OMG YES KAYLA I’M SO HAPPY FOR YOU
I’m in a long distance relationship too 😭❤️ but I get to see him again in May in Florida, want to hang out? 😂
hoooooollllllllllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy crap Kayla!!!! I'm so happy for you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! EEEEEEEEKKKKKKKk ❤❤❤
Bro this is more important to me than my family (Except for my dog he's my world)
oh my god ok as a person who is also long distance (two partners but they’re both in the US) i am so, so, SO excited that you have a ballpark for when you’re going to see him again. the hardest thing for me and my partners has been having no idea when we’ll see each other again, and it’s been more than a year already. i’m so happy for y’all and so excited for what’s to come in your lives!!
Congratulations Simsie, I am so happy that you are happy!!!
Love this so cute happy you guys are finally moving forward
Congrats Kayla!!
Ahhhhhhhh Kayla is engaged😂😍😍😍

Once I graduate from UNI I’m moving to England and I have absolutely ZERO idea how visas work. I’ve researched but a lot of it is super technical and it’s hard for me to comprehend so whether Simsie or other people who’ve experienced this have advice on how it works, I would greatly appreciate it
Congratulations!! This is so amazing! I had an internship with an immigration lawyer last year and it's the career path I'm planning to pursue... HOLY COW there is SO much red tape in immigration. I hadn't heard about that lawsuit (the firm I work with works mostly with asylum cases) but I am absolutely not surprised lmao. So happy for you!! :)
Omg congratulations!!! 🎉🎉
I am so happy for you. YAY!
Omg congrats 💗
Congratulations Simsie!
KAYLA CONGRATULATIONS 😭❤️
Congratzz!!🥳🥳
OMG CONGRATULATIONS!!! You should build your dream wedding in the sims!

Kaylaa!!! 😭😭 I didn’t realize that the engagement/marriage is now around the corner when you got the visa interview! I’m super excited for you two aahhhhh!
I am sooo happy for you, I can only imagine how you felt the last year

OMG Kayla congrats!!!!
This is amazing. Congrats 🥰
Super excited for y’all but I just gotta say.. that thumbnail is golden😂😂😂

Congratulations on your engagement ❤️
*AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*
Congrats!!!
I had a dream about you announcing the engagement by building a wedding venue and you put a cowplant and a sized up duck as bride and groom. Let's just say this announcement is kinda a let down 😂
AHHHHHHH
OMG I’M SO HAPPY FOR YOU!
So v happy for you both <3
Lilsimsie know my tragic country exists ❤️🇧🇷
Congratulations!
I am excited for you
WTF! CONGRATS BBY!
"Dan and I are NOT getting married" - Kayla every time she's asked on stream  Everyone: yeah right
Super excited about this for you!!! ❤❤❤
My aunt did this too! It was in the 80’s and she was moving from Colombia to Germany. She had such a difficult time immigrating because she had to take a ton of drug tests coz everyone thought she was a drug mule. She even gave up her Colombian citizenship. My point it, this seems like such a hard process and I’m glad to hear things are turning up!
Your story is very similar to mine! (Minus the pinini) We have been married now for 7 years! Thank you for sharing your story and the process is WILD, it took us 18 months. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, i promise!! Best of luck and congratulations!!
awww kayla, congrats i had no idea you were engaged!!!! EEEEEE I'm so happy for you!!!!
OH MY GOD WOAHWOAHWOAH
I love this type of video from you Kayla! Nice just having a chat !
YAY!!! Congratulations!
I now see why this would not be the best video to post yesterday.....anyways congratulations miss simsie!!!!!!!
ONGGGGG
WOW He estado viendo a Kayla desde que tiene como mil subs y estoy tan sorprendida! Aún recuerdo cuando hablaba sobre la chica de su escuela que se metía con ella. Tenemos la misma edad y ahora me siento vieja con esta noticia jajajaja Felicidades! Saludos desde Perú.  Wow! I've been watching Kayla since like 1k subscribers and I am really surprise! I still remember when she talked about that girl from school who was picking on her. We have the same age and now I feel so old with that annoucement hahahaha Congratulations! Greetings from Peru <3 And sorry for my english...
I'm so happy for you and Dan!! I know this has been really difficult
Lilsimsie is growing up omg 🥺🥺 ive been here since 10,000 subscribers and just aghhhhh. We’re the same age and frowing up together in a way is so weird
IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU KAYLA IM REALLY CRYING
When my husband and I announced our engagement i had a family member who continued to ask me if "I'm sure he's not using me for my visa?" When we announced our intent to live in his home country the person then changed his question to "are you sure he's not just tricking you to sell you into slavery?"   I couldn't win. My husband and I have just celebrated 2 years married, 5 years together.   Stay strong, and best of luck to you, hon! ❤✊
Kayak is engaged, Congrats! 🥳 🎊 🎉 💕
But...if she takes his last name, her last name won't be Sims anymore. 😭😭😭 Jk lol, super happy for them 💜

I know what you're going through, having been the fiance doing the emigrating, but like... 15 years ago and not during a pandemic. I promise you, it wasn't easy then either though lol. I've always felt that since we had to go through so much trouble in order to get married, our marriage started out extra strong thanks to the uh... trauma bonding, I guess lol Anyway, you two crazy kids, so very very happy for you <3
Congrats to you and Dan!!!
Congrats, Kayla!! I'm so happy for you. ❤️
CONGRATULATIONS SWEETHEART

Does the idea of marriage scare you? Especially as you are both considered quite young by some people. Or has this process made you realise it is a lot more complex than what is traditionally portrayed, because this has definitely made me view it in a different way! Congratulations by the way!! 💕💕💕

Wait seriously! Your engaged x
Congratulations Kayla!❤️
Fun story about an engagement visa: My aunt got married (my mom, cousins, other aunt and uncle all think it was a money/moving to the US thing), travelled to the US a few times for the VISA, but they had to prove that they were really in a relationship. So my aunt had our family, who had never even seen a pic of this man, say stuff like “You and Joe are soooo cute!” “Joe is such a nice person” so they could get married. They lasted half a year (like I said, a money/moving to US thing, so obviously it didn’t work).
Awww I wish the both of you nothing but happiness ❤️✨
OH????? CONGRATS!!!
i had no idea kayla was engaged.
Im so proud of you Kayla. You and Dan deserve eachothers. Gongratulatios!!💕💕

I feel like I have been waiting for this for EVER (the news). And thr process is a nightmare and ongoing. It never ends. I know personally. Congratulations! ❤
I hope the question isn't too stupid but did the engagement happen before the idea of the visa happen or did you think about applying for a visa and decided going for a fiancé visa?
Congrats! 😄😁🥰
Oh my god, congratulations! I’m so happy for you!
And to think I literally started watching you when you started college and I was a Freshman in high school
i remember watching kayla when she was 16 and now she’s engaged wtf
OMG THIS IS NOT A DRILL AHHHHH CONGRATS
Let this be a lesson for people to understand what we legal immigrants go through. I work for a company where my work is super critical and yet I have to go through a lottery system for the H-1B visa SMH and my time to get the US citizenship is little over 90 years from today. yes. 90!

I don't care how sappy this is, I'm saying it. Just yesterday I was thinking about how much I admire you! Youtube is not the easy job people think it is. You upload daily, stream daily, and did it all while going to college full time. You are such an awesome hard working person and I'm so proud of how much you've accomplished for yourself! You deserve all the happiness in the world and I'm so thrilled for you!
Yay!!!!! I was wondering how your relationship was going with the whole not being able to see each other
WHAT??!!
I am SO happy for you!
I SAW THE TITLE AND JUST WENT “AAAAAAHHHHHHH”
Fiancé?! When did that happen?! Did I miss the announcement or something? I can't believe I've been watching Kayla's videos for 2 years now, and I didn't know! 😂 But congratulations Kayla! I'm so so happy for you! 🥰
