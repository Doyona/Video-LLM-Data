Dont care, Dune won 6 oscars report on that
Chris Rock, don't assume that what you did is accepted all over the world. Sure, Will Smith hit you, it may be wrong. But if you call his slap violence, you're making that mistake too. It's not just violence. Chris Rock, what you said is verbal violence. It's not a joke that is accepted all over the world. If you're talking about an Academy Award, you should make a joke that's accepted all over the world. There are overwhelmingly many critical opinions about your actions in Japan.
😮
* If Mike Tyson and wife was present instead of W/S would Criss place the same joke?🤔All media professionals should be aware and responsible how to behave verbally and use their power in terms of verbal respect, moral and style attitude….you can not offend a un-health person which is facing in general hard time….. In a civil world the academy organization should establish  rules and penalties to all addressed so all aware and no monkey business. * This said Will should be banned for ever from the awards and Criss should be fined and addressed with severe responsibility advice so this may not happen again in the future trough out all presenters….and guest…..
The 2022 Academy Awards was a HOT🥵MESS long before Will Smith brought his personal problems onto center stage. This award show has become an embarrassment!! Everything seemed to be cut and edited to save time to be able to fit everything in before the lights were turned off on their audience. While watching this fiasco I felt I was a racehorse running in last place then Instantaneously finding myself over the finish line with a flower🌺wreath around my neck! It sincerely felt like everyone was at 78 speed on a 3-minute egg timer. Eighty-percent of the winners weren’t even allowed to give their acceptance speeches without being cut short and ushered off stage . . . What a huge lack of respect for the recipient winners! Worst academy award show I have ever wasted my time watching! It appears it has definitely lost the class and charm it once had. It’s been on a downhill slide for many years since allowing itself to become a political statement circus. I for one -lan to skip these ridiculous shows in the future.🙄
The sound of one hand slapping (and what a whimpy slap....Joan Crawford and General Patton would sneer)
Chris rock deserve more of slapped from will smith that all..!!! I have no respect to him!!
Being compared to GI Jane is actually a comparison of strength, determination, courage, and the ability to do what is considered 'masculine' as a woman. Women can be beautiful with or without hair. Having hair would not define her. That was the essence of GI Jane. If the only thing we got from that movie was about that character's shaven head shows how shallots we can be
HOLLYWOOD HIPOCRISY! w. smith, shoulda been forced to leave, and all those paper actors that stood up and gave him a standing ovation are just as FOS as w. smith. CHRIS ROCK WAS THE REAL MAN!
When Oscars normalize violence
R9B S6A Chris Rock needs to own his ungentlemanly and undignified behavior in disrespecting the mother of Will Smith's children and sit the f*** down. Shut the f*** up. And show some gratitude for the grace and restraint Mr. Smith showed him in not closing his fingers and knocking Chris Rock's teeth down his throat. My deepest respect to Mr. Smith for defending the honor of such an honorable woman. Veritas.  PS. Congratulations on your Oscar.
We as Americans cannot allow this huge indignation to the American Viewers and their families!!! We need to boycott Will Smith and support Chris Rock!!! This type of bullying has no place! I can tell you that if Will Smith would have slapped The Rock (Dwayne Johnson), Will would be partying on a gurney! Chris is not a fighter, he’s a comedian. The unbelievable arrogance of Will to slap Chris and to mouth-off after he sat down as if he was in his own house! Then goes off and to party and shows no remorse. Yep right, that’s how they do it right? We need to support Chris Rock!!! Justice for Chris!!!!
I love how will smith laughed at first, and then his wife was like “ i didnt like that”
Chris Rock should sue the Academy and Will Smith
https://youtu.be/n2z_NACVPxY
The Oscars production team FAILED Chris Rock big time. There was NO protection for Chris Rock. He was bullied on live international TV and was left alone to continue the show. Where was security? Where was a spokesperson from the production team? Why was Will Smith allowed to continue cursing out load on live TV and not escorted out, but allowed to accept his Oscar, make a speech and party all night. Rich and famous gives you a pass to commit a crime on live TV then party all night?. SMH!
Chris Rock was an amazing Professional!!!
The academy needs to hit them with a law suit of huge fines like they do with the NBA and other Sports. There should be consequences for violence !!!!!!
Will Smith has so much anger inside him that he walked all way to harm Chris Rock Just because of a joke.  The funny part is when he started ''crying'' {crocodile tears} describe how people in Hollywood abuse and talk crazy about him,  yet he does the exact abuse to someone else
Brave Will Smith, how he slapped Chris Rock ... I'd love to see what it  would be like if that same joke about Smith's wife was told by Dwayne  Johnson! In fact, I have an idea of ​​what would happen ... Smith would  go on stage, and then he would blow Dwayne Johnson's dick, that's for  sure!
Forget the Gold Party. I think Chris Rock should visit Jada Pinkett Smith's red table talk
Love Chris more than ever now - Go Chris  - you ROCK!!!!!
Then Will Goes & Does That! Is there a place for us  Arieanna with someone like will acting like that. He was a great example all this time in the game at 52 acts a fool for love. Please search and find happiness with someone who loves you for you, who you really are. What you Did Will was so damaging to you & your career.
You know the Oscars are down when you gotta invite Amy Schumer to your show
Staged af! Oscar's needed a redeemer in the ratings.. nobody watches this crap because of it's politically correct undertones
Andy Kaufman. Nuff Said. Pass it on.
Will  !  I  amm  mm  absolutely proud  of  you !  YOU  ARE  THE  MAN ! Will ! Cheers
Will ! You  are  the  Man! Do not  touch  faimily !
Jokes are not jokes any more but an opportunity to be bullies...way to go holliwood...you are an embarrasment to many.  Your glitter is gone...
ttps://youtu.be/Ni29N1PRy5k   can we punch Will Smith too because he's mocking Gay people who gets beaten, killed or bullied worldwide because they are gay?
Madea would have stole the show 🤣
NO he did NOT "take a joke too far"  WILL Smith is the one that went too far !! Commentator seems to think it was allrigt to be violent in front of millions of people watching 😠
In 1989 WILL DID JAILTIME FOR ASSAULT ,LATER HE SLAPPED A REPORTER IN MEN IN BLACK PREMIERE THEN JAIL TIME FOR REFUSING TO PAY IRS 2.8M
Wait till  4/01, turth will come out
Denzel should've gotten it or Clint Eastwood
Denzel was right
Will smiles has he walks away after the slap
Even if I tried it I couldn’t write a bigger joke than this channel made of itself into by suggesting Chris Rock was the one who went too far
Everyone better be careful bc Jada bats an eyelash and will is gonna STRIKE.
Ghetto ghetto ghetto, get his Oscar back!!!!
Will defending his wifes honor like the old days when couples had open marriages wow!shes sleeping with guys her kids age.look at how happy she looks with other men rather than her husband.no men should fight over any woman specifically when they cheated on you and made you accept it.wills mom prob sayin mama didn't raise no fool
What classless act by classless man, and a foul mouth to go wt it all!!  U keep ur private love to urself showing off thru public scene?!!!?? So ugly man he is !!
So THR is cool with that foolishness?
congrats mr. smith for the best actor of his movie but slapping mr.rock at the oscar is very wrong...but apologies accepted
That was the lowest point of Oscar. Will Smith went down in history hall of shame along with his Oscar win .
the oscar this yr is tainted bcoz of what smith done to chris rock
I will never watch a Will Smith video, movie, or re run of anything he  has done in his life. He is dead to me. I thought he was better than that. My bad.
ATTENTION CHRIS ROCK PUT A LAW SUIT for $1.5 BILLIONS DOLLARS. Will Smith can't take a joke but Chris Rock can take a hit now how fair is that??? I notice your jaw was off line and looked damage.  Will Smith needs to be charge for Aggravated Assault just because he is rich doesn't give him a right to hit anyone. Also Chris Rock was Roasting. Later Will Smith the Coward start crying because he knows he might go to jail and be charge.  Will Smith is a Coward hit a man while his hands on his back. No man does that only COWARDS!!  BOYCOTT EMMY'S AND ALL WILL SMITH MOVIES. Also Will Smith needs to be ( Out Cast from any Future Movies )
People make fun of kardashians but you don't see them slapping anyone. Even they have more class than Will Smith.
will smith should have been marched right out of that building!!!  period!  Chris did NOT GO TOO FAR!  hate news people to want to spread BS and twist it.
It was a joke that went too far, come on. Don't make excuses for wills inexcusable behavior.
I'm afraid for the movie he represents. And the sisters Williams will loose lot of money because of crazy man who is the main caractere  who represent her father!!! We have watching the end of one african american oligarc. If not, in sunday, I can slap my pastor. Will Smith did it! Why not me...for LOVE
Great hosts. Amy Schumer even had some funny lines, ..... I wonder who she stole them from.
This is what's wrong for America
The fact that NO ONE in that room did anything to console Chris Rock, and instead, consoled the violent aggressor, and gave HIM (Will) a standing ovation SHOWS how Harvey Weinstein was able to get away with everything in Hollywood so long. Hollywood is full of fakes, and their moral values are fleeting as emotions. Will should have been immediately escorted out and police called. His award should have been rescinded. He should be banned from the Academy. Actions ALWAYS speak louder than words. Hollywood is all politics and about personal capital gain, there is no moral high ground. If it was a white woman comedian, would he been able to continue? If it was a white male comedian, would he have even dared? We know the answer is no to both. The fact that it was a fellow black man, he felt he had the power to calmly assault and GET AWAY with it, and HE DID. He calmly walked up, it was not a rush of rage. This will never be forgotten. Will and everyone else in that room besides Chris disgust me.
So let me get this straight, your daughter is writing books calling native north African racists and savages and calling Muslims monsters, your wife is spreading her legs and humiliating you with other men and the way you try to regain your "honor" is to slap a dude who didn't take the joke too far by the way, you could've said keep my wife name out of your mouth BEFORE slapping him. Pathetic
imagine Dwayne Johnson making that joke lmao Will Smith will just sit there and cry
I had hoped that by today people would have stopped thinking this makes a difference in their lives let alone having any true meaning. Very sad days.
. :
Probably no more jokes to avoid this type of drama !! I love will smith , but this one went wayyyy to far .
to many colors 1960 much better
Will more worried about a joke than his wife cheating on him which was more of a slap in the face than this bs.
The entire group are immature irresponsible over paid clowns. Unfortunately, society honors unstable people and there flaunting lifestyle.
Trash. Absolute trash.
Want to see more of will smith? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf0QixbfM2U
maybe will smith doesmt belong to showbiz
Did you see Chris rock get slapped tho?...I dropped a video on it https://youtu.be/0LJyRFX9Jd0
After this awful Oscars broadcast; it is time for ABC to divest itself from the Oscars. Just give the show to the streamers. Just My Opinion.🦄🐲
Will is disgusting
Itsssss aaaaa fakeeeeee
uh.... how can a dude who can't speak win a award that base's your performance on how well you can acted and talk?
U guys show a false world .
Stop giving a lollipop to nation n rest of the world about the Slogan of Cleaner Greener Planet .
All the celebrities supporting Will for his behavior are cowards.   Thank you John Leguizamo for not being afraid of stating the truth. A true man of character.
Leave Will Smith alone, if i had been Will Smith someone had made a joke about my wife, knowing her health issue that resulting in her loss of hair, I would have clocked Chris Rock. Like all the rest of us, don't mess with our loved ones, or you gonna get it.
Fo the rich by the rich ...
Will Smith vs Chris Rock meme   https://youtu.be/hyMwN_-VkMQ
imagine will smith slapping jadas lover??? or giving him money??
You can guarantee that had it been The Rock or Shaq making that joke, Will "The Fresh Prince of Nohair" Smith would have smacked them too and by smacked I mean kissed!
he slapped not hit stop misinforming
The fact that media has made Alopecia and an insult the story of the day and have largely dismissed the fact that a crime was committed on stage has stripped yet another layer of my liberal sensibilities.
https://youtu.be/O_rObWYcEk
Wierd that will smith didn't get triggered and "emotional", towards August Alsina when he was fornicating with HIS WIFE!!!
Booooooo boooooooooo
No respect for Will Smith ever again! He could have a talk with Chris Rock after the awards.
Rumor has it MIKE TYSON will be hosting the Awards next time 😂😆

Brought to you this spring by National Geographic. " One Slapped Rock" 😂
Women complain about inequality, but if Chris rock made that joke towards a MAN with alopecia. You think the wife would go up and slap him? No, he’s a man and can take a joke. That’s the difference between men and women when it comes to sensitivity.
Chris Rock needs to press charges ,, imagine if every comic got slapped or punched for their jokes, Comedy would not exist. And the academy needs to take the Oscar back from Will Smith to show the rest of us. It is not ok to go around punching people, Will Smith did not even give Chris Rock a chance to cover or try to defend himself...of any of us would do that , we would be arrested . .
Will Smith was wrong to physically assault someone who only used their words. Loss of respect.  The Academy should be protecting their MC from anyone stepping to the stage. Bad move academy.
They need to take that Oscar from Will Smith and eject him from the Academy.  PERIOD.  Or Oscars will be slugfests til it just can’t be held.  They have rules about violence in that organization.  Too late for apologies.  The throwing shade at the privileged Hollywood elite is a long standing tradition and that joke was practically a compliment and delivered with for god’s sake, “I love you”.  I remember when Will had a sense of humor and a little humility.
CHRIS ROCK CAN TAKE A SLAP...CAN WILL SMITH??
LETS SEE WILL SMITH JOIN THE IRISH SLAP LEAGUE
The Oscars ratings went up
IMAGINE LOSING ALL RESPECT FOR BLACK LIVE MATTER??? BY BLACK ON BLACK VIOLENCE ON A PUBLIC "STAGED""ACTION??
IMAGINE SHOWING ONLY BLACK LIVES MATTER ADVOCATES "HATING EACH OTHER"???
Starting of with that bit@h Scamy Schumer. Stop video, thumbs down, block channel.
I know it won't matter, but I'm gonna type this anyway: I have lost all respect for Will Smith. I don't know how long it will take for me to even want to watch him in anything again.  Expressing anger with violence just means one isn't intelligent enough to talk things over. I'm disappointed. 😒
It’s a publicity stunt if you look really close you can’t see that a couple of the people “closet” to him knew the joke watch Chris rock as will walks up to him hint: the gesture
A comedian makes fun of someone. How inappropriate, said no one who has ever seen Chris Rock perform. I honestly think Will is such a nobody anymore that this was his only way to get his name back in the media. Pretty pathetic
Keep my ugly wife's name out ya FRICK'N MOUTH  ! ! !
Hollywood is a cancer.
Funny thing is, white folks didn't go this hard when their counter parts ransacked the white House! 🤔
much respect for Chris. Took it like a champ and held his composure. He didn’t even press charges after.
Oh yea …… his wife tol him ya do it. Disgrace to your Race Will Smith.
The Ghetto Awards
How was Will Smith at least not told to leave? If this happened in a store or a mall he would of been arrested. Absolutely ridiculous and this is another reason I’m done with the Oscar’s and ABC. How was nothing done to protect Chris Rock? What happens if Chris falls and cracks his skull open?  Will Smith is no hero or anyone to look up too. He’s got several inches and 50 pounds in Chris Rock? What a low life, sucker punching, idiot. Welcome to your new Oscars.  Absolutely classless by Will Smith, ABC, & the Academy Awards.
Black peoples gehin to brig fo der b(i)riches.
Shame on the academy…he should had (at least)  been escorted out. If Smith is planning to attack all the people that makes fun of his weird family; he better stay home
Saying jada has a disease because she is going bald is typical from “these” people always the victim but yet victimize others #chrisrock without a blink of the eye
Couldn't imagine Willie Smith doing that to Dwayne,Willie would have been like cool man
Staged.
El mundo de arte, debería ser el embajador para la "no violencia escolar".  Hacer burlas a una mujer que padece ALOPECIA no es gracioso.
No te puedes reír de una persona que padece una enfermedad y menos si se trata de su mujer que sufre de alopecia. La mujer lo hizo público y aún así, se atreven a burlarse.  Te felicito Will!!!!
What’s up for next year’s show? A stabbing over a card game? Jerry Springer? What a class act.
I'm a mom and I've always taught my son to Never respond to taunts and teasing with Violence. I told him to always use your words. Will Smith was out of line, nothing Chris said, excuses his actions.  Chris Rock was the big man last night; grace under pressure.
That joke was not that bad, Will Smith should be ashamed of himself.  The ladys joke did not cause that kind of reaction in anyone they joked about. Will needs to be banned. PERIOD.  I am never spending another dime on anything he is in. Done with the Will/Jada Smith family.  A disgrace.
Chris deserved it gud slap for dissrespecting a lady like that, i don't care who says what, 👍up will.
TASTELESSS STRAIGHT OUT TASTELESS
Ok at the end there making joke about Timothy. But you don’t see him slapping  the three woman that made a sexist joke   But .. will smith did
https://youtu.be/kqhVNZgZGqQ  Rock begins his rant on the Smith's at 2:40 several years ago. There is more going on than meets the eye.
I think we can all agree that having Amy Schumer host the oscars was the real tragedy of the night
I may be showing my age here but I'm proud to do so. I remember watching, Charlton Heston, Grace Kelly, Rock Hudson, Robert Taylor just to name afew at the Academy Awards.  Those were the legends and the beauty in both men and women shined and it will never be like that again. I have lost interest in ALL this Hollywood stuff. Witnessing what I saw last night validated my feelings. These actors get paid how much? And they act like this? You get a profession such as a person who is a Nurses Aid they have to fight to get an extra dollar in their pay checks but because these people out in Hollywood or wherever they are appear on a tv screen or movie screen get millions of dollars and ALL these award shows for doing what exactly?? Society is backwards folks because Nurses Aids, Garbage Collectors, etc...deserves what these actors get. Actors and Actresses cry if they don't get the million.  I think its awful we give to much hype to celebrities and for what???  I realize there are great actors today, Kevin Costner, Robert DeNiro, Denzel Washington and some others but what happened last night just spoiled it ALL.  I'm SO glad I'm from an older generation!!
Will ruined that stupid show over a stupid joke..now he looks stupid 😬
*EVERY celeb gets roasted, Will obviously lost his temper, I mean their relationship is so public and messy, he took it out on Chris* 😶
❤️❤️❤️❤️
If it wasn't for Will slapping Chris, I wouldn't have known the Oscar's even happened
The Oscar goes to, the slap in the face.
I've grew up watching these two men and loved them both BUT what Will Smith did was unacceptable. I think it was obvious that Chris was the escape goat (sort of speak) for a man suffering from something other and took advantage of the moment just because he could! Hats off to Chris for taking it like a gentleman. He took that slap like a priest exercises demons and thats what was needed for the time..
Will Smith had every right…
“Here’s a tip you should never forget: If your woman is mad at you, leave her at home. Cause a mad woman will do anything” - Chris Rock
The actions of Smith are unacceptable, and furthermore a crime in California. Chris Rock is a comedian, and strangely Smith laughed, then just a roll of his wife's eyes caused a snap. ADULTS tease each other daily. I see an emotionally labile Smith...snaps, later cries, then parties down with dance and laughter. The Academy just got trashed further.
Shameful
Shameful. Then you wonder why there is so much violence in our major cities.
What it all comes down to is that Will Smith just destroyed his career. When studios, producers, directors and everyone involved in films determine who will be hired, they must base their decisions on whether or not a “star” is a liability. Will Smith is definitely a liability now.
Who cares.
Will’s having a breakdown. That’s what all this looks like to me.
ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE ACT OF VIOLENCE! Chris’ response was millions of viewers response! Not appalled by the slap because Will was anxious and responded out of uncontrolled anger. I am very disappointed in The Academy for not having Will escorted out of the room! NOW all the wonderful of the night has been overshadowed by this asinine behavior. 😢
What are they 2 year olds ?  Two phony balony Actors . Why was Will Smith not Arrested ? Chis Rock has millions of Witnesses to the Assault ?
A disgrace to the Oscar academy who stands for no violence! Will should be ashamed and he should be returning the Oscar out of his own accord! Will first laughed at the joke himself. He should have used his acting skills, which he proved not to possess, instead of giving a bad image through violence and bad language in front of kids!!!!! And then talking about being a vessel of love?!?!? This is way out of line! Of course, all fellow actors would always be supportive to Will Smith because it would have repercussions on them.
the ghetto Oscar's so disappointing
We are not perfect. What happens with taking time out to talk and understand one another?😫
Chris be careful. I am proud you were Calm. Blessings
Shaved head with a dark green dress. G.I. Jane meets the Oscars. A true badass moment taken one way an insult another. Many of us had no idea she had a condition. Even with that knowledge I would have taken it as him saying she was a badass being there in the front row with no wig or head covering. I in no way saw it as an insult.what about all the celebrities that have had fat jokes or things about their relationships hurled at them? None of them got up and hit anyone. There is no excuse for the slap. Defending your partner against words should be with words and shouldn’t even include profanity. What a low class response to a joke.
Can’t we be better than this? Will Smith
Will Smith shame shame.
What’s it’s wrong with us?  Can we have respect for one another? This is very,very disturbing what are we teaching our children every thing we use Violence? No not Acceptable.
This entire spectacle is disgusting. All of it. Hollywood is a viper pit. Oscars schmoscars. Support Ukraine? Oh you’re sooo virtuous! Aren’t you speeeecial! Yeah. You bet. First thing on my agenda.... save the world from itself. I’ll get right on that first thing tomorrow. Calling in the team right now.   🤮
Hollywood reporter: “Chris rock took a joke too far “ BUT describes “Will is only human “ Chris Rock was the epitome of “ The show must go on“. He’s the class act.
LOL, is this an OSCAR for VIOLENCE????  What example is for the world at this time when there is an war in Europe.  Uncontrolled behavior!  Very sad to see this! Billions people will remember this as the saddest  day on show business!  NOT ACCEPTABLE for any REASONS!!!
lol, the fact that Will Smith can do that and not get arrested just shows that celebrities can do anything they want
I wonder if it's okay for my child to hit anyone that says something he does not like⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️
Will Smith :  "oh O did I just laughed at that joke ⁉️ I better show my wife that I am. A "man" .
Will Smith is a very arrogant person who cannot control himself and has now proven himself to be criminal and dangerous!
Hollywood trash telling everyone how to live but living by a different set of rules.  If Will Smith was a Republican or a Trump supporter he would have been arrested and banned from Hollywood.  Democrats / Liberals live by the belief that anything is OK when it fits their agenda.  The United States has become a place where entertainers and professional athletes are mistaken for people of importance.... I've Needed a Doctor.. I've Needed a Teacher.. I NEED farmers every day.. I Need Truck Drivers every day. I have NEEDED an auto mechanic, a plumber, a house painter and a lot of other everyday people. But I have NEVER, not even once, NEEDED a pro athlete, a media personality, or a Hollywood entertainer for ANYTHING!
Black osckar
Chris Rock...you're the man...professional all the way...Will Smith you're a piece of work...You're not all that but you think you are...I promise you your career is going to fail...pride will bring you down every time...
Lawsuit takes time. The Court of public opinion is swift!
Will Smith did to Chris Rock what Jada has been doing to him. Jada has physically and emotionally bullied Will because he's weak. She sleeps with her son's best friend and makes their personal lives public and Will does nothing, he just takes it. Narcissists prey on weak individuals with high empathy who don't have boundaries and Will has been manipulated so much that he's now protecting his abuser. Will slapped Chris because he saw an opportunity to assault someone he thought was weaker than himself to protect the image of his wife who is a toxic narcissist.
The best actor is a cuckoo! 😄
It doesn't look real ain't they friends.
These people are clowns and this is your circus, laughable
We were so close to getting a movie not in the English language to win Best Documentary Feature
Academy Awards -- Oscar 2022 was trash, trash, trash.
Who cares!!!!! Lazy complacent Americans 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Looks like Rick James,Ike Turner,and Joe Jackson have  competition now,,
Don’t care!  Didn’t watch!  Tasteless, classless, self-aggrandizing, unimaginative showcasing of pompous, insulated anti-US progressives.  When Hollywood reconnects with the rest of America, maybe people will start watching again.
Baldy Jada.. Jokes
Trash
It was staged, leaving all your conjectures the brunt of this joke!!
Will smacked flames out your boy
Will Smith feeling White! Entitled. .. V-titled!   ...   V for Violence!!
The "Oscars"???? That crap still being televised? 'Rassling shows or pro Hockey gets better ratings.
Sadly, Will Smith went all O.J. and  Bill Cosby.
Chris did nothing wrong.  Love then both.  Comedy must go on.
Assault is absolutely criminal, so sick of these entitled delusional celebrities not facing consequences for their actions. Will Smith should be in jail
YouTube Jada speaking on her condition, she says she just needs to laugh at it  And she laughs. Will is a defender of his bad behavior.
Everything is staged. All got fooled🤡🤡
Will Smith, you started off Mr. Clean rap, mind your parents, don't curse, to....this.  YUCK WILL!! JUST YUCK!! Act like a freaking grown up. I hope they take his award cause that was bull$hit. It was truly disgusting to watch Will and it was nice to see Chris Rock take it like a pro.
Anyone else see Kayne 2.0? “Imma let you finish Chris but let’s all take a minute and remember Wild Wild West” 🤪
Me enjoyed many decades of Will Smith since the 1980s along with his Wife Jada since the 1990's & Chris Rock since the 1990's, but Chris Rock humor should be based on Hyperboles (Intentional exaggerations) and not real-experiences or hurtful misfortunes of the people who are joked with or about.  So perhaps all Comedians should base their comedy on Hyperboles and not "downfalls" or hurtful-misfortunes of anyone!  So Great decision, Will Smith to provide a lesson to Chris Rock and possibly all Comedians to not Gain your Fortune by Hurting others!  Malave' Contreras Monday 28th of March 2022.  Brother Will Smith, I have another thought-----you are the complete "package" of what a Man should be, what you did could lead to changing Comedy to be "mindful, sympathetic & empathetic" rather than desensitizing people and maybe people excuse or forget what an insult is and when comedy could "go too far" and it's no longer comedy.  I would not change not a moment of what you've done----it's overdue actually.
Can someone explain the joke, I'm sure I'm not the only one who didn't understand
The way Benedict Cumberbatch holds his wife's hands while this was being filmed was so heartwarming. He's like it's okay sweetie, I'm here.  As someone who has PTSD and anxiety,... that moment in the background warmed my heart. You need reassurance and kindness, after moments of violence.
CR had better press charges or he will look like a joke (Go figure, a comedian that looks like the joke).  No one is above the law and he will be a bona fide wimp if he just took it "on the chin" like that!  Everyone is coming to WS's defense and CR is off in the corner nursing his wounds.  He had better do something or I will never feel the same way about him again.  He will lose a certain amount of gravitas (which has been his trademark) if he doesn't man up.  WS could go ahead and plead out or something after but he better do something otherwise he will be the butt of the joke going forward instead of WS who it really should be for "defending the honor" of a woman that publicly screws around on him and then brings him to the Red Table to stick it in his face in front of millions.  Cmon CR.  Don't let me down. Black person finally hosts the show and this is how we act....  I bet he wouldn't pull that stuff on Chappelle.
Murica
I heard what happened
The class is gone. Even the boobs hanging out. Wow. Need to hold the Oscar’s at the Local bar with two for one now.
If Will felt so mad about it the joke why was he sitting there laughing explain that😄
And the Simp of the yr  award goes to.....
I already loved Chris Rock, but he gained so much more respect; whereas Will Smith lost the remaining. Goodbye bruh.
The Only person who was Offensive was Will Smith. He should have been REMOVED from the premises. Face it if it was a white man who did the slap...the Police  would have had him on the floor in handcuffs. Enough of this woke crap!
honestly, that joke was so beneath Chris Rock. It was actually shocking that he would make a joke that juvenile and stupid
Like millions of people, I've enjoyed Will Smith and his performances, and I've enjoyed Chris Rock's comedy. I'm heart broken to see the lack of class that Mr Smith exhibited, and the degradation of the Oscar Awards that he brought to it. It hurt everyone, even damaging the careers of all people of color, by bringing ghetto behavior to a black tie event. Most of all I will miss Will, who committed career suicide, because I'm one of millions of people that will never look at him again. Bye Bye
Make us forget people fight for they life everywhere over the world.. With a fake slap.. Well done
Uncle Phil wouldn't approve
I don’t understand the idea of protecting somebody that cheated on you.just look like a SIMP 🤣😂🤣🤦🏻‍♂️.she literally just had a rappers private in her 👄.
# Chris Rock  Lives Matter
Chris rock  The comedian #will have a field day now😂😂😂
I’m glad this video exists, let’s me know I made the right choice not watching Oscar’s this year.
Will Smith proved to the world what entitlement looks like. 🤡🌎
Black privilege
Real men do real things. Joking about a man’s wife health ain’t funny. Get slapped
Willie just mad cuz wifey been hoeing 🤣😂
Violence is the last resort of an ignorant person.
Smith as lost all my respect, that was a savage thing to do , Chris should press charges.
F Smith. I'll never watch another of his movies (not that he gives a crap). He wouldn't have done that if it had been Dwayne Johnson instead of Rock.
Will Smith is a fraud. Jada Pinkett Smith is a fraud. He's gay, she's gay. And their MO is promoting themselves as the 'enlightened' man, the 'enlightened' woman in an 'enlightened' heterosexual marriage BESIDES being BLACK! Puh! The Hollywood press has been wanting to call these two phonies out for years but can't for accusations of being discriminating because they are BLACK! Right? Now. Me thinks Will Smith, foreseeing an Oscar win could prompt the press to finally reveal the truth about he and his fraudulent 'enlightened' selves, JUMPS at the opportunity to forever dispel rumours that he is GAY by clocking Chris Rock over a tasteless joke about his wife. He goes into Straight, Angry Black Man Mode to defend the honour, the name of HIS woman before a live, international audience. The Academy Awards! I mean. Will Smith may have won an Academy Award for acting but what a loser for utilizing the ceremony as a shameless, marketing tool for his phoney self. Then again, in the context of this being the Age of Kardashian, Bravo Mr. Macho Black Man Will Smith! Aim LOW for the crowd and count the money. Note. During 93 years of the Oscars, you never saw a white man jump the stage to slug a comedian over a tasteless joke about his wife. Just sayin'.
The slap looks choreographed to me.
"keep my wife's name out of your mouth" Meanwhile she had trouble keeping other dudes out of her mouth
Comedians will have to be paid higher wages for working in combat zones at award shows. Will Smith went there. He sure wasn’t acting like ‘a vessel of love’ as he claimed to be in his speech. Chris Rock is the class act for not pressing charges. Btw, Will laughed at the GI Jane 2 joke. Guess one he got a look from his wife it wasn’t so funny. So now any audience member is free to go punch a comedian for being teased or hearing a joke that offends them. Then after hitting the comedian, you return to your seat where you not once, but twice yell at the man you assaulted to  ‘keep my wife’s name outta your F—ing mouth!’  It was inappropriate and disrespectful behavior. The fact that it was Will Smith doesn’t make it okay to hit a man. His son tweets  later, ‘that how we do it’. Great role model, dad. Seriously, Will Smith was not acting like himself at all. His speech was bizarre, and he seemed to be coming apart in real time on TV. Apologize to Chris, see  a therapist, and practice anger management skills 24/7.
Woke on tap💯
I'm sorry but we all hear things we don't like in life but to go up to someone and assault them? there is no excuse for his actions. He should be charged and arrested like any other person if they did this on the street. This is the problem into today's society one rule for thee and one rule for me. These so called elites should be held accountable too!
A lot of you are all despicable and wrong for backing Chris Rock for saying that disrespectful comment about Jada Pinkett Smith's condition. You guys are so wrong to think that comedy condones moral ethics or moral responsibility
OscarsSoWoke!
The Oscars don’t appear to be safe place!  How or why the security staff with the directions from the producers allowed Will Smith to stay on the facilities, I don’t know?  If Smith was not ‘A’ lister, he would have been escorted off the of the property.  What struck me (pardon the pun) was that when Smith received his Oscar, he got a standing ovation from his pears.  In Smith acceptable/accuse/apologize speech he tried to act his way out of taking no responsibility for his actions.  This was assault, plain and simple and no crying or conflating of Richard Williams story connects the dots to man hitting another man to protect his family from a joke!  The Oscars were having difficulty getting a comedian to host the show before (can you say fear of being cancelled), how will they in the future?
Chris Rock top of the class...Will? Bruh😒😒😒 they should take the Oscar away from him😡😡😡
Am I the only one thinking “ and you were the ones complaining that black people don’t get enough nominations? ,  this is not the hood homies. There are better ways to handle anger Without making a scene “.
Now Chris Rock will be famous for being slapped by will forever.
If your ashamed for your bald head, just where a wig!!! Its just a joke. People with glasses gets bullied to. Its just a joke!
One embarrassing moment for 2022
They have all the money in the world.. lets put this into prospective. its not like  Cancer or something!!!.. I lost my hair at 20 years old  and I don't make no Will smith money or Jada .. it happens  for men and woman ( Alopecia).. and like deal with it.  Besides how many times has will smith made fun of others ??. Man I mIss " In living Color"
I hope Chris Rock sues Will...
I feel like wills wife told him to do it because if you look when he says the joke will is laughing and his wife has a pissed face so maybeeee?
Take back the oscar.
I wish Chris dodged and then brought up being cuckolded cause then they would’ve all been trash
How about his wife Jada keeping August Alsina out of her Mouth 👄!!
Will Smith hits Like a girl, but his mouth hits  harder
Money doesn’t give you class thats why music and film suck with these people
He doesnt have the right to slap. Another slap history from will smith https://youtu.be/XXNm28b_2I4
WILL IS A DISGRACE
Chris and all other presenters who go too far (ie: Ricky Jervais) deserve reprocussions.  Although, Will should have slapped him behind the stage.
These spoilt, overpaid kings and queens of tinsel town need to be kicked off the court, and we, the people need to decide how much they are paid.  Too much money makes people act like apes.
We support WILL SMITH!!!! Rock lost my respect and this don’t 1954
What's more shocking than a stagged slap to bring up the atrocious raitings is the fact that they think Amy Schumer is relevant enough for literally anyone to care about.
That slap was heard around the world when a giant ego slapped one who then showed himself to be a class act. There's no excuse for Smith's violent behaviour, and no sane reason for him CHOOSING not to take a joke at which he'd already laughed. Wonder where else that violent hand has flown in the heat of a moment, or for the sake of another's displeasure. The abuser sure appeared to get a lot of sympathy in the wake of his outburst, cry victims of abuse around the world. We all saw the attack, now let's see some justice for Rock. -A now former fan of the Arrogant Mr. Smith.
Will smith just validated the decades of white washing at the Oscars, this is Exactly why they didn't want you there. After all Chris Rock said it best "I love Black People BUT I HATE ...."
Will was not the only one who "slapped" here. Sometimes jokes can't be taken light-heartedly, it's a fact. Chris should apologize to Will and Will should apologize to Chris. The end. And Chris, my respect for not  pressing charges, you are magnanimous. The law should be kept out of this situation.
And ALL of America Said- Let Ricky Gervais & Chris Rock Host Them All!!!
Did the character in GI Jane have Alopecia?
So what she has hair loss so do I so do a lot of people . Will you made yourself look like the fool you really are .
I am not a fan of such violence but it is not safe for anyone to mock at someone else wife's illness and not knowing what she is actually going through with the illness. Cracking jokes if fun but as a professional comedian he needed to be mindful and do some research before picking on her, no one would like that. That was quite a sensitive topic to pick anyway. They need to genuinely reconcile and the public should learn from this because this could happen to anyone.
What Chris said wasn't funny. Jada is stunning and Will is a very great actor. Chris is jealous.
They are all Slappers. I'm not sexist, but a grown man slapping.
If anything he should be banned from all future award shows PERIOD!
The fact that Will wasn’t kicked out and then allowed to accept an Oscar is mind blowing and then he didn’t even apologize to Chris! Imagine if that was a non famous person off the street or someone’s spouse? They would have been arrested! I wonder who will be the first comedian on stage to get “Will Slapped “ because there was no consequences….Chris was a class act
Sorry But Will Was Wrong For Slapping Chris He Could Of Waited To Slap Him On Break Smh He Didn’t Act Like That When August Was Smashing Jada😒💅🏽It Was The Awkward Silence Afterwards For Meeee😂🤦🏽‍♀️
Will Smith behaved so immature and silly
Ele guentou muito soco do Caruzo, isso ai é tranquilo pra ele
This wasn't about defending his wife. This is more about been emasculated and been the butt of jokes on different front due to the recent events brought about by, you guess who, and Will finally having his moment in front of the entire world to play tough guy and let the world know he would no longer be the butt of jokes. Chris is a comedian and that's what they do. Much, much kudos to Chris for not retaliating 'cos you already know that would have set the race back 50 years.
Oscars did promise to be more black. Success! Jada wears wigs for years, loses her real hair then showcases it and gets offended?! F her, oh wait, only Wills little boys friends are allowed to have GI Jada in their mouth.
Now this Oscar will be remembered when Will Smith hit Chris Rock and not Will Smith winning best actor award🤔
Unbeliveble how he just hit a collegue...lost all my respect for him. Thats a mirrow of what he is living in doors...and no lady would let her mate humilliate himself in a act of impulse and desesperation....so sad...Chris handle it like a true gentleman....i would ask him to be arrested....
It was staged, cuz NOBODY watches the Stupid woke Osacars anymore ! its all they have..
Will Smith was WRONG!
Hypocrites people. In Oscar acceptance bad behavior ooo yea just because his is black actor ooo yea . When Trump was president the hypocrites are laughing making horrible jokes to Trump family ooo yea .Trump has feelings is a human being too . Madonna she said she is gonna blow up the white 🏠. That was not a joke . George Lopez destroy the Hollywood Trum start and grorge made peep 👀 on top . A comedian took a fake head telling this was Trump. What a disgusting 🤮 people disgusting hypocrites all of them . Evil Oscar.
Did I miss the Oscar burning? I do not watch fake people who want other fake people to praise them or a fake slap for ratings. Art does NOT imitate life, but these people with very little scruples make trash movies that our kids imitate. Go slap each other, please and thank you.
Will Smith needs to apologies to Chris Rock for his harsh behavior.
Chivalry isn't dead (A man standing up for his woman).  It's actually refreshing to see.. All Smith did was hurt Rock's pride nothing more!  She has a condition!!! Not acceptable to joke like that,    It's like the Kenny Rogers song Coward of the County.   Smith did what he felt was right. Completely understand why Smith did what he did. This should be the end of the matter imo.
If Dwayne Johnson said that joke Will Smith would've been seated the whole time.
No one cares about Hollywood
Chris Rock is a true pro for his reaction. The comedian ended up being the classy one.
I want Ricky Jervaise next year. No doubt.
This was embarrassing. Will and Chris and Stephen A giving his input smh It makes us look bad.
this is the most Oscars I've watched in 10 years
Will Smith is a Karen!
Its obvious Will has something against Chris, can you imagine Will doing that to some other comedians like Eddie Griffin? he would of got slapped back
great, Bravo will, I would have hit him twice too, for showing respect to my family, or to anyone's, it is a lack of respect, so that you learn to respect, you are here to Animate the Oscars, laugh at your mother, to see if you like it .  bravo will
https://youtu.be/AN16hRbJBDQ
Shame on you Will Smith.
Will should have been tackled by security, escorted out of the venue and held until the police arrived! That's what would happen to you or i
Will did Assault Chris Rock ! Will need to get his home together
Will should apologize to Chris Rock ! Chris Rock shoulda be careful from what he said. I think Will ! Maybe shouldn't get Oscar but he deserves it.
Will just opened Pandora's Box for all comedians to go full blitzkrieg due to a lack of decorum in the ethos he professes. The five fingers to the face open palmed smack was an overall bad look on a world stage with those optics in losing your composure and not being disciplined with tact.
There is nothing wrong with hitting people who say things you don't like.
Send will smith to ukraine+
Chris rock went too far? Please don't look up ricky gervais' celebrity beat downs
Still miss better musical talent. Van Morrison miles ahead of Screeching Beyonce. Cumberbach much much much better in Louis Wain than the DOg movie. Chris Rock has NEVER made me laugh. Brit humour please.
No more ill smith movies for me!
Privileged is when you can walk on stage during a live award show and slap a man. Then sit back down in the front row and cuss him out.. Only to return to the stage fifteen minutes later to be given and award and make a speech acting like a victim.... If this is not privilege I don't know what it.
Lateral Violence at its best! Will Smith would not have done this to a white man or an Asian….   And to think these are the fools they call role models. Sigh🙄  "IF" it was a genuine assault and it was not rehearsed, I hope Chris charges Will with assault.  Regardless of what's going on in his life, Will Smith chose to assault someone in a public setting. These clowns know full well that it is being televised worldwide, and their poor actions will be immediate.  Talk about sending a message that power, fame and money mean you will not be held to the same standards as the average person in society.  Lastly, the Oscars should REMOVE his award and condone his violence against another person, but more so, a black comedian just doing his job!   #condonelateralviolence
Just you wait and see, all Comics are going to Galvanize and eviscerate Will Smith and his wife now.
To anything that will smith has to say about hitting Chris Rock:____  *_shut up will smith,_* you're a grown man. you just behaved like a toddler.. at your age, with your, hate to use this term, but 'privilege'... you should know how to keep your ego in check! ←   ↑ Comment for algorithm + 👍 'd #OldManPaxus Rating: ☆☆☆ ½
if it were Mike Tyson doing the presentation instead of Chris Rock, would Will Smith have done the same?  And what protection is he talking about? That's just an excuse for his selective courage BS.  Is this act of violence ok depending on your stardom?
Chris Rock is a comedian, he handled the situation with grace!!  Assault is not justifiable. Everyone babying Will afterwards was unbelievable, talking with him, hugging him, he made the moment about him. CHRIS ROCK, you are the man!!!!!  Grace under pressure!
Will Smith u are nt human...
Amy Schumer's joke about 3 women being cheaper than 1 man, is essentially the same joke that Gervais did about being paid the same as Poehler and Fey combined for hosting the Golden Globes...
Academy where is Vladimir Putin OSCAR'S award for violence 🙄
CODA winning the Oscars is a victory for the parasitic creative industry in Hollywood... A remake? They trully run out of ideas....
She cheated on him and he’s whining about a joke too far give me a break you guys suck
Amy Moooomer
Who on the Earth publicly slaps ppl ??? I feel so bad for him😂
I think #ChrisRockshouldsue
Straight up GHETTO!!! If this occurred at a wedding Will Smith would of been asked to leave if not thrown out!
Chris Rock and Will Smith definitely need to get on Dr. Phil or The Jerry Springer show to get some proffesional help
Jada's toxic, she's been the centre of all the drama in will's life, turning him in to a different person
Self-congratulating fluff - woke.  Wake up people
Will Smith IS the joke.
That was acting
I thought It was an act 🤦🏻‍♂️
Nice to know there relationship is open to anything but jokes 🤣🤣
Will Smith should be punished for his actions.  In most states what he did was against the law,  not sure about Cali though, they get away with all kinds of BAD behavior.
Some Hollywood "demigods" struggle with being mere mortals having to deal with poor people issues like alopecia.
No one cares about Hollywood
Overreaction is all that was, can't take a joke even tho Jada has humiliated Will publicly more than once
You can’t laugh about it and go up there and assaults a person will smith need to be put in check
Chris Rock did not go too far with the joke are you people out of your mind you think you can get away with being a spoiled gross disgusting rich brat and everyone's going to Pat you on the back the way Bradley Cooper and Denzel Washington just did you're out of your mind
Am I the only one who thinks the Will Smith thing was totally staged? Oscars desperate to be relevant again?
No no no, what we aren't going to do is say Chris went too far. He didn't. Will did
He hit Chris like the alien in id4
Chris Rock is (in my opinion) A lot more funny when it comes to acting. I know one line that will always make me laugh... "It's cold in here!"
Yeah Will Smith does not deserve that award what he did to Chris is uncalled for nobody should ever put their hands on another person ever very disappointed. I am not a fan of Will Smith anymore. What a child he acted like. He definitely does not deserve that award
Will been wanting to give that slap to Jada but knew it wouldn't be received as well
Will smith should have been escorted out of the building after that violence.  And charged with assault!
Here we go again this is a prime example of what is the problem with the community someone that holds this type of standard in the community have made it to the Grammys the Emmys Oscars the Walk of Fame to stand up and act in this type of matter when is it going to stop and when are we going to stop making excuses for why a person should react in ignorance I've decided there's no hope and getting things back to normal because we all like the side shows and the clowns that play in them
Amy is horrible Wanda is horrible and don't know the other one name
Worst hoooosts ever
Coda is terrible Beyonce lost to 18 year old Billie Elish ha ha
Imagine Mike Tyson making that joke😅😁
Jada: "My boyfriend and I would like to thank Will Smith for his heroic actions tonight. We cannot let jokes made by professional comedians during live events go unpunished."...
Where is BLM for this violent act?  Where is the is the whole "cancel culture movement", #cancelwillsmith? Why did the OSCARS allow Will Smith to remain? Because there is NO racial privilege there is ONLY "money privilege".  Apparently Will Smith has more money, but Chris Rock is the better man! He should have had Will arrested and lawyer up!
Hollywood still not get rid of their wokeism..I hope this award show end very soon
If I had bought his book I would be throwing it in the trash right now
Poor Will!!! Worst kind of relationship ever!! when one side loves the other more than the other loves him!!! he feels that he has to win her love all the time!!!
The man in black slap 😅
I hate when y’all Block out the  Cuss word like nobody say it
Who does Will Smith think he is to lay a hand on someone. I was a fan, not anymore. Chris Rock was hired by the Oscars. So Chris Rock will sue the Oscars. And the Oscars will come after Will Smith. Then Will Smith cries while giving his speech. Will Smith u r a punk.
JUST give the man his 50-Cent rib.!! He said he ONLY wants ONE Rib, just one of them.. YA Hurd.!!!

I see rehab in his future.
I do not understand Smith reaction. That is part of black americans culture. They talk to each other in a way that for a foreigner sound like they are insulting each others, even when they are friends.
Thats what u called entanglement slap
Will just ruined his orcar winning day! everybody will remember that he slap Chris and not his oscar win!!!
Will:  My wife cheats on me with our son's R&B singer friend who lives with us but it doesn't bother me.  Also Will: A comedian jokes about my wife and that bothers me to the point of slapping the comedian live on TV.
Wills should be stripped of  The award ASAP.  If not it will be like Oscar promoting violence
Let’s here some more jokes Chris😂😂😂
Why was Will smiling when he went back to his seat?
Will he press charges 🤔  Why did the Academy allow this?
The joke was not about alopecia but about the close shave she sported. Physical assault is a dangerous felony punishable by law.
Protecting his family....do you mean protecting his wife from a joke.  Newsflash, we women can stand on our own 2 feet, thank you!
Will smith should be stripped from his Oscar for his actions. Very back roll model.
I am just so happy for Will finally winning a Oscar. Now, he can take a break from acting.
To Jada.. After what Will did, there better not be anymore ENTANGLEMENTS for you.. Just saying!
It's disturbing how Jada has betrayed, USED and humiliated her husband through the years.  I hope Jada gets as much or more heat for this as/than Will does.
He took a joke to far , B.S. after he said it Will laughed and it would have been forgotten until he went Hulk Smash.
First time I laughed at Amy Schaumburg. Historical in itself
Thanks will. Respect is a love-way street.
@chris rock should press charges. This is unacceptable. This opens the door to have « doing crazy sh*#t for love » … I’m floored 🤦🏼‍♂️
There were so many black people spotlighted, I thought I was watching soultrain. WOKE AT ITS FINEST.
He didn’t take the joke too far. She’s sporting a bald look for whatever reason, medical or not. It’s a joke. Let it roll off. Plus why laugh like you’re amused then do that?
Chris did not “take the joke too far.” This is the new Hollywood.
The academy awards have fully lost their identity... it is just sad. This could have been basically any other award show. The least they should do is rename it, so the actual academy awards can be remembered with some honor.
Black love speeches are common and so is black on black crime!
Never put your hands on anyone over words
That was violence, pure and simple.  And then to cast it as done out of love?  Sorry, not buying that.  Will Smith just undermined so many principles in a fit of uncontrolled anger.   Lost my respect for him.   And why was he not escorted out?  Lesser hecklers have been shown the door in similar instances.   Shame in the Academy.   And shame on the audience for applauding Will Smith’s win.    It’s hypocritical for actors to speak against violence and then applaud a perpetrator minutes after committing a violent act.  That moment on live TV just set us back decades in our crusade against violence.
I can't wait to hear Chris new material over this
Smith family is too weak. Cat take a little common joke.  No one can make a joke anymore. Will just killed the Oscars. No comedian will feel free to make a joke.  Chris is why too cool to be disrespected like that.  Chris deserves a real apology and a standing ovation
Everybody Loves Chris!
I think the slap is a payback from this previous remark by Chris Rock https://youtu.be/uImAmki-J38
Warren B can finally relax
The worse Oscar’s in history
That joke was not far or anything offensive.
What he did was so disrespectful to Chris and the Oscar’s academy that he should not get his award because of his behavior and I will never pay money or watch any if his movies again he should had been apologizeing to Chris in stage
will shouldnt have been able to receive his award at a minimum
Will Smith needs to move in with his Auntie and Uncle in Bel Air.
Agora vão esquecer o mendigo, com esse casos de família 👪 👊
come one chris rock say he lover her irght...its really just a joike and even will also laugh
*IF YOU LOOK AT JADA , SHE "WAS CLEARLY"  UPSET OVER THAT JOKE ..WILL DID THE RIGHT THING* *YOU EMBARRASS BY WIFE FOR THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE .."I EMBARRASS YOU"  FOR THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE* *END OF STORY*
If Jerry Seinfeld had made the same joke, Will Smith would have stayed in his seat.
4:30 the Devil/Entanglement was already coming for you, remember Will? Don't call Chris the devil now... just watch yo so called Wife!  Acting like R. Kelly on a nervous breakdown. I salute ur legacy... but as a straight up Man... u acting like a lil' puzzy.
She got cancer bro not a fever. It's not funny.
Evil Oscar were bad behavior is ok and they laughing 😂
Evil Oscar bad behavior is accepted
Think Will Smith should of waited to talk with Chris back stage or after the show and tell him man to man that him and jada was uncomfortable with his comments. Could of given him a chance to apologize. Understand Jada has a disease, and no one should be joking on any human being illness or disease. Assaulting him was out of character for Will, could of handle it better.
Will should be apologizing. He cried like he was some sort of role model…I don’t want my kids learning anything from him. He can’t take a joke, is violent, doesn’t show restraint or remorse. All around just a complete non-role model. Dude you are just an actor that is in a profession meant to entertain me.  And work for studios that want to make millions just like yourself. Don’t get on a high horse thinking you are educating and changing the world. You tainted your Oscar with that slap and no one will remember what you did to win. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Highlight - Amy/Wanda/Regina did a great job, Ariana’s win and speech, Denzel and the CODA love…. Lowlights - weird way they included the “cut” categories and everything after that moment….
uncivilized level class.
Nah, THR Will Smith laughed, yip laughed then assaulted Chris as an afterthought.
Diddy is the man that had 2pac and Biggy killed, why was a coward like that invited to the Oscars?
When you're rich and famous you can be as violent as you want.
Will was definitely out of order for hitting Chris. It wasn't that serious. Shame on him. Smh
Skill Smith over reacted and now he looks like a fool over a simple joke.
The academy and vanity fair need to come out and condemn his behaviour.
Two thumbs down
I feel sick to my stomach watching the assault. The amount of violence Americans accept anywhere is appalling.
lol, the fact that Will Smith can do that and not get arrested just shows that celebrities can do anything they want
Reminds me of Mel Gibsons fall from grace
popular opinion: amy isnt funny 😗
I bet Jada can't wait to cheat at Will the moment she gets back from the Oscars...
Chris had that slap 👋🏾 coming 🤣🤣🤣
But Will Smith is laughing at Chris joke though , so what happened????  This is soooo cringy to watch, assult  in a awards night , on national television . . . Is this the new trend?????????
If Chris rock joke was too far. What about Will Smith violence assault?
SMITTEN!
Chris Rock can take a punch but Will Smith can't take a punchline.
Disgusting behaviour
Will smith did not apologize to Chris Rock....
Mr Will SMITH used to be racists towards a fellow black cast member in FRESH PRINCE she played the mother and he forced her to quit.....did she ever punch you for it.
Hollywood hypocrites. Cancer patients, veterans, aids patients, people with disabilities can all take a joke. They even embrace it. Its just like Jada to take away Will’s moments and make it about her and her feelings instead of acting like and adult
I believe EVERYONE in Hollywood will cancel on Will Smith.  Netflix should remove ALL of Will Smith movies. This thuggish behaviour is unbecoming. Hollywood MUST STAND UP against bullying.
WORST DRESSER-AMIS
Yet, we can't comment.
Y’all are tripping imagine making a joke of someone’s illness and thinking they wouldn’t react in a negative way because it was a joke 🤮
I will never watch a movie with this child again
Chris should have kicked Smith in the nuts .
"He took the joke too far" this statement is a huge exaggeration.
Chris joke to far , see the face smith wife. Lost respect on chris
Cant wait for the red table talk with Chris Rock
Now if a white man had done that ! 😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Will Smith.  I think your whole family is over privileged and whiny.  Jada has a chip on her shoulder and so do you.  Come slap me.  I could use the money. 'Cause I'd sue you for assault.
FULL VIDEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT5P92pcVfE
Blame the devil, not jada
Will, you were wrong. You need to publicly apologize to Chris for that. Not cool.
It's so disappointing to see people white knight and justify Will's actions because his wife has alopecia(which is just the fancy medical term for going bald)- they're acting like she has some kind of terminal illness.   We literally have hundreds, if not thousands of jokes about Trump's comb over spanning decades- but Jada Pinkett going bald is off-limits for some reason and totally justifies physical assault if someone decides to "go there"... SMH
Wow… what kind of example was that. Black on black crime. He just demonstrated what kind of man he really is. Chris Rock is a comedian, jokes about anyone and anything should be expected. Is will smith the kind of person who should get endorsement monies on anything. This is an example of the really big picture problem we are suffering here in the United States. Rich elitism.
That could be the most expensive slap Will has ever given. Chris will never have to worry about being broke..
Too far?  He’s a comedian. Will was wrong for that. Period.
Chris should slap Will with a lawsuit.
Great! Another violent human being in a world of uncertainty. I raise my hat to Chris Rock for controlling the situation.
Lol they got the pig hosting? Hilarious.
That was the highlight of the Oscars. Hope Will comes back!  P.s if Will didnt slap Chris I wont even know that the Oscars happened Last night. 🤷‍♀️
*The Decline of the American Empire*
I support Will Smith.
Bro I think Will lost it bro
F Will Smith. Shame!  No sense of humor bully.  And, it was a funny joke.  She did look like GI Jane!
The joke was innocent and harmless Smith is a lunatic
The joke went too far? You don’t think assaulting a man was too far? Uhhhhh
People will always remember what he did and the fact that he got an oscar hasn't value anymore!
Will Smith damaged himself and credibility of Oscar.  His award should be revoked as Best Actor. His speech is hypocrite, the opposite of what he just done on stage to Chris.  This is not only a civil case but as well a criminal case for physical assault & slander by deeds.  If Will Smith could do this in live broadcast in television on stage during Oscar, what more behind the camera !!!!
Next year, a white man is going to assault a comedian and then get best actor award. Oh wait, only black can get away with it. Otherwise it's racist.
"At your highest moment, be careful, that's when the devil comes for you." Will Smith  WTH does he mean by that...? Given how deep into satanism the Hollywood elite are, those words were meant quite literally.
Abuse is abuse
Will, where's this energy when August and other men were sleeping with Jada? and how she always complains about how you're lacking compared to Tupac?
Nastiness & rudeness as entertainment & comment has gone far enough, & is not funny ? Well done Will !
Violence comes to the AA brought to you by a people that gotta throw hands no matter where.  The numbers bare this out, I just thought it was in ghettoes, well they movin on up.
The speech was worse  than the slap. What a hypocrite!
No one cares. Hollywood is getting smaller n smaller in everyone’s rear view mirror..
Imagine the initiations and rituals these people have to go through in order to keep their status.  The devil always demands a sacrifice.
Really ..? Naaah
Chris Rock may be entitled to financial compensation.
Will Smith should be arrested!! If it was anyone of us we would be in jail right now
He can take his wife getting fuked but not a joke
The question is which one do we cancel?
Someone should’ve slapped Amy
Talk about Bruno aggghhhh
There is NOTHING feminist about having a man acting physically violent towards another person over words (in this case over a tasteless joke) in the name of "love" or "protection". That's textbook toxic masculinity and domestic abuse. Will Smith is no role model and he needs therapy.
It sounds like the Hollywood reporter is defending will smith's violent outburst. Shame on you THR.
Damn it’s sad that it’s a huge night for the deaf community and it’s overshadowed by a slap.
#RESCINDtheOSCAR
Will slapping Chris will go down as the greatest TV moment of all time!
So can Ye get his Grammy performance back
Is this what the Academy wants, VIOLENCE during the Oscars?
I like how the first joke Amy Schumer makes is stolen
That Devil was Jada. She ok about have alopecia.  She has said that, she isn’t embarrassed by it.  What Will Smith did wasn’t cool, he’s a ignorant bully..
Considering everything Will has gone through over the last year, and now he displays this terrible character that has shocked us all!! I think these are signs of Mental health concerns that nobody close to him should ignore. He needs help. We have lost so many great ones where we ALL missed the signs of them needing help but nobody listened.
Lost respect for smith!
Hopefully this will be the beginning of the end of the entanglement. Had enough of these two.
Smith is ridiculous!
Chris didn't "take a joke too far" your command of the English language is lacking. Terrible reporting.
Why do people think Amy Schumer is funny...
Chris Rock deserves a medal for keeping his cool and continuing on with the award presentation.
No one talking about statues this year. Just a palm pump
Will Smith greatest hits Bad boys Men in Black Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Chris Rock 😳
Can’t believe violence was just condoned like that
It was fake
As we watch a Russian Bully violate his neighbor - we are reminded that 'privilege' carries it's own ignorance & self righteousness... Will Smith you mirror the worst of 'privilege' and then made us all watch it on an international broadcast. Shame on you.
Will Smith is a simp, after all his wife cheating with his son's friend. Poor dude but don't take it out on Chris Rock
Hmm I'm team Chris Rock . Will Smith is wack
Bad on you for normalizing Smith's behavior.  #disgusting
Oh
The "slap" heard around the world!
Can someone explain to me how being called GI Jane is insulting in any way?! Did everyone forget what that movie was about?  Here’s a recap, it’s about a strong willed, badass women who will stop at nothing to break down barriers for women, in this case in the military, and does so with respectability and care!   I actually think it was insulting to Demi Moore for Jada to be referred to as GI Jane. She and her husband, whom I use to love, are over privileged rich actors with superiority complex. I say that after their gross reaction to Chris Rocks actually kind joke!
If Will Smith's Oscar is not withdrawn, the Academy will be supporting violence and aggression. The Oscar must be withdrawn immediately.
Staged
Queen Beyoncé👑👑👑👑
It would of been better had someone slapped Amy too  🤣
Will was just projecting his own fear of the old "Wait till we get home" look his evil semi wife gave him. He than had to show off what he portrays as chivalry.  His tears in his acceptance speech gave him away as a weak individual. If you're gonna do it.....OWN IT!!! Don't cry like a baby later for sympathy to the rest of the elites as if "He just couldn't help himself and I just had to do what was right." He knew it was wrong.  Passive aggressive behavior is the hallmark of EVERY servile person.
That joke was too far? Will Smith is a weak little boy.
HOW WAS HE NOT ARRESTED?
I am Brazilian, I would do the same if someone had said something about my wife. Will, not only deserved an oscar, mais2 for the great performance in the slap in Rock
Light joke.. he could gone far
The irony of the King hitting the Jester🤦🏽‍♂️
I didn’t know Will was violent I don’t think I’ll watch his movies ever again that’s disrespectful to hit a comedian on stage
NOT ENOUGH BLACK PEOPLE WIN OSCARS PEOPLE ARE SAYING.
He laughed too, what a hypocrite. Made his acceptance speech total nonsense after that.
Wild times indeed .
He didn’t take it too far
He ruined it for himself. _No one_ is talking about his Oscar win, they’re talking about his violent, live outburst.
Black privilege.  Nothing was done about it
They don't mention will smith laughing at the joke too
😂
gays are very emotional
Even after that, everyone will still call Will softer than Charmin though 😅
He made a joke about hair loss, Will laughed at the joke & then went and assaulted a comedian doing what he was hired to do. Charges should be pressed this is disgusting.
Will smith is a simp for that
How disappointing. No one cares that you won an Oscar. Completely overshadowed by his digesting violence. Chris did not deserve that.
will is in the right i think don’t talk about his wife?
He should go to jail but probably won't they'll just lock up a lot of innocent people to make up for it and now I'm wondering what they'll do with the red table that I really liked there's no repairing this enough for that show to continue I always thought he looked really cute until I saw that anger coming from him it wasn't Chris Rock who slept with his wife
Smith's marriage is open to everything except for jokes
Ooooo if a woman did this...
https://youtube.com/channel/UCtGwR0WbYLmulTmzmslYG1w
Under no circumstances, it is NOT OK to laugh at someone's appearance or illness.
If this is how Will Smith behaves in public, just imagine what he's like in private....  😨
Shame On will smith
I came here for the slap, not to be preached about gender/identiy politics.
I hope Ricky Gervais comes next year and address this. It will be so much fun😂😂
will ruin the show by showing violence and all america who watch it because he cant take a joke
At first I had thought Chris joked about August Alsina!
Chris Rock made a documentary about Black Woman’s hair. Then decides to embarrass a Black Woman about her hair, in front of hundreds of millions of people. Now we all know Jada has alopecia. She has said it’s a huge insecurity. Chris was wrong. And the slap, was warranted. Don’t disrespect Black Women.
Will Smith is absolutely disgusting and he should be ashamed himself. He’s not. But he should be.
Captain SaveAHo to the rescue!  He can only handle "entanglements", not jokes.
How was it a joke too far???? Will Smith was well out of order ppl make joke there all the time
Cancel will
will smith can go to jail by being violent ..a bad example for children..
How the FCK is Ms. Piggy, I mean Amy Schumer relevant??
I love the fact that Chris was like "I could oooooooh". He could've kept going and said more but he held that back. Will just gave him free material right there.
Damn, everybody DOES hate Chris!
He was laughing till he saw his wife
Everything is scripted. Nothing is real. This "act" served to get people talking about an annual event that people care less about every year and served to restore Will Smith's image a straight male hero, of which all three are untrue.
how many people actually watched the Oscars? somehow after seeing Ricky Gervais host the golden globes, watching someone else host for any award function leads to a bland experience. Even Amy Schumer's joke on Leo and his "girlfriends" paled in comparison to Gervais's delivery of the same premise. The academy has to take a page from the golden globe's playbook on choosing hosts if they wanna survive.
Move him back in with his auntie and uncle in Bel Air!
Will accepts someone who slept with his wife but he couldn't accept someone joke about his wife's hair? I thought they were "open".
What Will Smith has is real privilege. Not what they say white men have. When you can assault someone on national television and get away with it.
Will was laughing at first. He probably saw Jada's face and asked himself "what would Tupac do?" 😅
A bunch of dumba emeffers
Will Smith, mental freak show weirdo lunatic. Take his award back, he doesn't deserve it.
This shows Celebrities are not gods they're filthy animals
The epitome of HYPOCRITE #willsmith
You can take a man out of Philly, but you can't take Philly out of the man.
💉☠️💉☠️💉☠️💉
From being a former comedian, guess Will can dish out the jokes but can't take them back.
Chris I would have him arrested for assault I saw it I will be a witness
@willsmith is a p%#y he knows @chrisrock won’t hit back but if it was somebody bigger than him he wouldn’t say or do anything about it he picks his fights!!!
Apparently Will's wife has a disease which makes u bold. It doesn't justify him assaulting Chris rock, but it makes more sense knowing that it wasn't JUST because of the simple joke, which I thought was the case at first
Back in the day, when a black man would make a simple joke about a white women, that black man would have been set upon with violence and even killed. Its funny how the rolls have changed.
Cancel--- will Smith he show violence.
Chris should have said "woah it's a joke, not a dick, don't take it so hard...a bit like Jada already did"  🤣
For the next year, Every comedian should start their set with a joke about Jada's bald head
Took a joke too far?
That joke didn't go too far
if this was real, then why did Will laugh at the joke?
Will slapping Chris ..so what ..I want to know if reba is immortal ..look at the woman ..how old is she now ..
Chris didn´t mean to hurt the Smith family. He said "Jada, I love You" before came up with GI Jane 2 joke which led to Will punched him. Maybe Chris should more skeptical on the viewers next time before delivering his jokes😊
The most predictable and boring wins ever
Making fun of a woman's alopecia on stage in an internationally televised event ISN'T FUNNY!!!!
Why did he copy Birdman's saying put some respect on my name
Is this Oscar's for blacks only
I am still waiting to see Sean Penn destroying his OSCAR! 🥱
They should have played the theme song from "Everybody Hates Chris" after he slapped him
Will Smith needs to get his house in order before he attends any public appearances. Thinking abuse in any form is okay weakens cases for the abused. Get your s**t together man and be a respectable human being. The appropriate thing to have done was approach the stage and describe his wife's condition, he would've walked away a bigger man instead of this sorry excuse of one!!
Is that "Celebrity Privilege"? That angry little boy should have gotten arrested for assault, "Press Charges". It is ok for his wife to be intimate with another man (open marriage), but not for someone to tell a joke about her in front of him?
Remove will Smith Oscar and make him publicly apologize to Chris
Will Smith is acting like a punk
What did the 5 fingers say to the face?! But seriously, a complete overreaction from Will Smith, battery/assault was not the answer! Should have composed himself and used his acceptance speech to work in a great compliment about his wife & her hair loss condition!  Tbh, was expecting a subtle & well worked Dora Milaje joke from Chris Rock when he started talking about Jada, but went with the GI Jane one instead!
The COVID skit would not fly if it was a man feeling up four actresses. Just sayin.
Long story  short, jada is loosing  her hair due to a disease. Chris  was making  fun of her for having short hair. Will got mad and hit Chris.
What if will smith was white?
Her hair should be back by August
how embarrassing to work so hard and finally get recognized for such a great role and tomorrow everyone will be talking about him acting like a savage instead of a winner, lost all respect for Will
Violence is never a proof of love
Look out Will. Ricky Gervais is coming for you.
😍
Will cracked under the pressure Man. Chris wasn’t out of line so much was he?
Team 'Bad Boy 4 Life!'
Team Will!  Below the belt joke!
will is 2022s version of mili vanilli
Will Smith should have been dragged out of the theater and charged with assault. Instead they still gave him an award and he cried and acted like he was somehow the victim. What a disgrace!
imagine Dwayne Johnson making that joke lmao Will Smith will just sit there and cry
They had to make sure it was very "inclusive " or else 🤣
Chris Rock did Not say anything offensive.. Will Smith seems like he's having a breakdown
Amy Schumer literally stealing jokes from Ricky Gervais, straight off the bat!
Okay but where was this energy when Jaden's friend was blowing Jada's back out?
