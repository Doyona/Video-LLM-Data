Very good, keep it up!
I wish Ronaldo came back at a time when the club was managed well, this Ronaldo return era was just sad
Ten Hag OUT. Can't recognize the best player at the club.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
I love Mark's take on united normally, but sadly he comes across in this video as "if you don't agree with me then you're wrong".  Sadly I was cringing at how disrespectful he was to people's comments tonight. Not his usual high standard of punditry
I now believe that MU will probably soon be successful again. Just sad that everyone will forget all that success come from Ronaldo sacrificing his reputation for the club. Because this interview now all the necessary foundation for success will be built to support Ten Hag.
I can't believe the bias toward Ronaldo. He did expose the club but you don't do it while you are still being employed by the club! and you don't disrespect your current manager like that.
Ronaldo out 10hag out Glazer out Manchester kabupaten out
From his return to the club, something wasn’t right. Its plot to put all the blame on him. So, MU will not go far as MC. The management out. Owner out.
At the end of the day the conclusion of every article will prove how badly the club was run through out all these years. The facilities from the gym all the way to the kitchen was stuck with Alex era left me speechless
I think ronaldo is telling the truth i think ten hag did dis respect rronaldo
Bhai support karo
I respect and love Ronaldo for the joy he brought me through his journey  in his first stint as a united player  unfortunately I've been frustrated with the way the team plays when he starts it effect's Evey other players performances  all trying to appease Ronaldo which hurt us many times all the best for the future Ronaldo 👍
Poor decision by Ronaldo. Wish him well on his new journey. United have a new hero in Garnacho.
Noone is safe from Brexit ! Not even Ronaldo! It's time to get our country back! Our players in our clubs !!!
Ronaldo pure genius 👏  look how the club is ran. ronaldo would of never been let go at least he will get a transfer now In January which is perfect for him look what happens to players who get their head down and just get on with it. They get kept prisoner at our club. I don't blame ronaldo at all he is the best player at the club and he needs to be playing every game! the players that have been put in front of ronaldo playing has been awful. The truth is we would be In the same place as last year if it wasn't for casimiro and the signings erik ten hag has implemented. Ronaldo biological age is proberly a lot younger than most players he lives the life. Special player deserves more and I think he has still got it just needs a club to believe in him and manage him correctly he needs to be at the centre of the clubs plans. He is a goat. Erik tan hag has done incredibly well with the team he's got and his man management skills. But  he has failed with ronaldo. You can't get everything right and you can't always get on with everyone. Gutted for ronaldo.
It would have been Jose mourinho's fault if he was still the manager.
اللهم صل على محمد وعلى آل محمد، كما صليت على إبراهيم وعلى آل إبراهيم إنك حميد مجيد، اللهم بارك على محمد وعلى آل محمد كما باركت على إبراهيم وعلى آل إبراهيم إنك حميد مجيد
Middlesbrough training ground is world class and there 14th in championship ours are fair to poor
Omg Goldbridge with the contradictions. Talks non-stop about a rebuild. Now someone mentions a rebuild and it's "how ridiculous"..?
Oh ffs yeah because Ten Hag is soooo afraid of telling the truth right? Yep totally.
But it's just that he doesn't respect ten hag. He doesn't respect him...why? Because he benched him?! So what he's 37!!! You're not going to okay every game.
It's so funny to me how Goldbridge will do anything and everything in his power to protect Ronaldo. "Nobody's perfect" what? So if Harry Maguire did the same thing you'd just be like "that's understandable, of course he's at that place" no I don't think so.
Thanks for the philosophy lesson at the beginning
Glazers OUT
He doesnt respect the club, the coach, always wants to leave, then please leave.
🤣 United can’t get anything right 🤣
Very good analytical skills, Mark!
Get rid, at this level he is finished. We should be talking about our last gasp winner yesterday. He did this after we beat Spurs as well and probably had our best performance under ETH, he wants all the attention for him and not the team
I’m 100% glazers out but it’s still not good for the club regardless ronaldo has been given chances and proved he can not play in the system that the manager wants to play remember ronaldo was brought in before ten hag took charge and I think if he had been in charge ronaldo wouldn’t have been brought back since his return last season he changed things I honestly think we had such a bad season last season because he put a lot of other players noses out of joint he will always be a legend in our club and the world of football but it’s over
Another Legend, Ibrahimovic hinted about this years ago , nothing has changed everyone can see this but nothing happens ... Sad 😢
In a way Ronaldo has actually played this perfectly. He clearly wants out and by doing this interview it forces United’s hand to sell him without any question. It also helps United because it forces the Glazers to counteract all the things he will expose even if only for the short term it will force the club to buy a striker which will need. This might actually prove to be a very pivotal moment in the United’s future. Either way it helps ETH by moving on Ronaldo who never really suited the new United but ETH was stuck with him and at least now he can buy a player(s) more in his image.
This is why i don`t sub to this channel, Ronaldo is a big egotistic crybaby, and always has been. We all know the club is run badly, geeeez we haven`t been talking about anything else for the past ten years! But when Ronaldo says it it`s suddenly big news, REALLY????????? And then taking a stab towards Ten Hag, do you really think Ten Hag was going to say anything else about Ronaldo in the summer? He`s seen who Ronaldo really is now, i`ve seen it the past 15 years!
"Not the 1920s you cheeky gets" 🤣🤣🤣
The interview must have been after Rooney’s interview on talkSPORT last week
Hope Ronaldo gets signed to a proper club that’s run well
Get your scarves out glazers out! 🔰🔰
Bro denying the fact that he came out
feel sorry for everyone who bought a Ronaldo shirt
Both are Aquarius, no surprised on their Butt Heads 😜👍🤜🤛
Goldbridge a Ronaldo fanboy who doesn’t even go to go to games
I cannot for the life of me understand the people jumping on Ronaldo with this interview. He is basically throwing himself in the line of fire to save the club from further mismanagement and bring back the glory days. Those people who are defending ten Hag are deluded by the wins and not seeing the big picture. So many ex. Players have said what Ronaldo has said publicly and now Ronaldo has validated it as he is on the inside as a current player. His love for the club echos what we fans have always wanted. For all we know, ten Hag mishandled Ronaldo during his time mourning the loss of his daughter. The game against Villa is was another abysmal performance if not for Garnacho saving the game, let's not kid ourselves. There has been many other abysmal performances since the start of the season under ten Hag let us not forget about that. This manager has yet to prove or win anything!
Ronaldo basically said glazers out
Cometh the hour, cometh the idiot. I will never respect Tin Hat. Ronaldo is a legend in the league of Best, Maradona, Pele. They will live on, Tin Hat is a nobody.
I agree w CR!  His comments of Ten Hag are his opinion of the man. You may disagree but he can say it. Further, I can understand how CR could see he is disrespected by Ten Hag, however, I can also see how Ten Hag may feel disrespected as well.   As for Rangnick comments - completely agree w CR.   Sad to see this legend go out like this at MUFC but he need to go to a club that will give him the time on the pitch and allow him to play his game. This interview is a good thing and I hope CR will find a better place to play. MUFC needs to get the Glazers out or we will continue to struggle.
for everyone else, life is not black and white, there are shades for grey. For Goldbridge it's red green and amber.
I don't condone it slamming our manager but maybe he had issues from the start just like Jose had with Martial
I wish Ronaldo buys man UTD
🍿🍺😀
He has to go.
Mark the only legend left at man utd lol. CR7 enough is enough get rid off asap. No one is bigger than man utd.
Love Ronaldo but time to go,he knew what he was doing and at a time that suits him aswe.Selfish and needs to go he not the the sort of personality we need to move forward so let's cut ties before more people turn on him and I'm sorry but mark needs to crawl out of he's arse
We have to keep pushing Glazers Out
Did ronaldo say anything about sancho
If Ronaldo was made of chocolate, Mark would eat him.
I can understand Ronaldo stance on Ten Hag. He was the top scorer last year and was the reason we got somewhere last year. This year he stayed out because of a legitimate reason and he has been side lined. Someone who is used to success to see this is frustrating. But man this is sad
1.10 does this Mark guy actually support Manchester United or is he just some Ronaldo stan
He's not finished yet people watch an see 🙂🙂🙂
"We all make mistakes", sorry do not agree with that especially when there have been other incidents. Its a perfectly orchestrated maneuver by Ronaldo to get out of the club. Becoming a bad influence and needs to go, dont care what your history is!
Ronaldo is not 100 percent Right but either he's not wrong on some of the things he said
United became a big club only because of fergie
Glazers out! And the legend has spoken. Cant crucify him for the truth. I like both ronaldo and ten hag. Doubt ronaldo will ever play for man utd again. Hope he ends his career on a high at another club.
This is the best thing that could happen for the fans and for the club he has fully exposed the club for everything wrong they have done - who else can do this, he came back to club and his voice will help change it and save it
Cr Ronaldo ❤️  ❤️  ❤️  🔥 🔥
Speaking before a camera and actions off camera and different things...simply coz ETH says he respects TEN HAG on camera and does different on the pitch is pathetic......
it's Not Ten Hag forcing Ronaldo out its those other three Muppets. John Murtaugh and Co worrying about there 500k a week looking for more pennies to pinch tight Arsed like tweezer tips
glazers out movement has to stand strong now more than ever
If this was Harry Maguire you'd absolutely be saying: "Get out of our club." He says he has no respect for the manager. He has got to go. It's as simple as that. You can't defend him.
Using the glazers as a smokescreen to defend Ronaldo's actions... Imagine if it was Rashford, Pogba or Fred
Ronaldo did not deserve to play in the last few games.Ten Hag even gave him the captain arm ban which he did not deserve.Clearly he is not agile as he used to be.Behaving like a youth.Mess up his Legend status.Unruly behaviour.Enough is enough.
it just shows how much cr7 loves manchester united. well done cr7 for exposing the truth
Ronaldo made a comment about Coco Cola and their share price dropped significantly. I wonder what his recent comments have done to the share price for Man Utd.
🔴VIVA RONALDO🔴 🔰GLAZERS OUT NOW🔰
Coward why not announce this last week then go back into training ground face up to the club… Snake 🐍
Wasn't Ronaldo pictured at a basketball game, all smiling when the team was on pre season?
Opening line…,classic goldbridge
Eth didn’t want to play garnachovbecause he didn’t like his egos.
Ronaldo represents freedom and for all you hr woke pussies who love Marx, Che Guevara, and Castro, too bad
Ironically this could be the best thing ever to  expose the Man Utd management etc. glaziers out !
Rangnick get ronaldo to score 24 goals last season
Thanks for fair and unbiased view on the Ronaldo subject ! Thanks mark for good mature reflection.
He's not wrong that Utd have been a mess! In any case, one of the greatest to ever do it. That can never be undone.
Marks spot on with this. Everyone knows how unacceptable the stuff about ten haag and rangnick is, but its a shame he’s said that as it’s all anyones talking about and not the neglect of the ownership that he’s highlighted
That he disrespects Ten Hag, because of his own behaviour en less playing time is really sad to be honest.
Ronaldo is possibly the most famous football player ever. Him doing this interview hurts his reputation and he still did it. There has to be a decent amount of truth in it.
I agree with Ronaldo's assessment of the lack of ambition from the owners to upgrade and do the things necessary that top clubs do and invest in to remain at the top and challenge at the top level. I'm disappointed in his relationship with Ten Hag and coming out against Ten Hag in this manner. I will always love Ronaldo and he will always remain a club legend in my opinion. I will sing his songs and wear his jersey with pride for all he did for our club when he was on the field. Time to part ways for sure, GO ManU, Glazers OUT!!!!!, Viva Ronaldo!!!!!
What a sad end to the career at United of one of our best ever players.
It's a real shame how all this has played out, massive respect for Ronaldo for all he's accomplished but it seems he personally feels there is no way back thus the interview. As for our dear club there's so much to do, as Ragnick said we really need open heart surgery we've papered over the cracks till they've become chasms
He doesn't look like a liar, how would you know?  "I did not have sexual relations with that woman." Bill Clinton. 🤣 But I suppose he was a politician
he never had to come back
25:40 that statement in and of itself is an absolute
Really feel sorry for him.Could have joined city and won CL.
This is where I'm 50/50 Regarding Ronaldo's explosive interview. Imo Ronaldo was right to call the club out how it's run etc cos we all know it's being run by complete incompetent fools who haven't got a fuckin clue. The club hasn't moved with the times  our stadium is falling part out training facilities are so vastly outdated it's embarrassing really so I agree with Ronaldo there.  On the other hand tho I do not agree with him literally publically slagging off Ten Hag & Rangnick. Ten Hag has defended Ronaldo publically. I don't think Ten Hag has disrespected Ronaldo has handled Ronaldo brilliantly imo. Ronaldo is the one showing the disrespect. He's the one that refused to come off the bench & now he's refused to play full stop. He's the one that's been pushing for many months now to leave United desite the club wanting to keep him & cos of that I think this interview with that creep Piers Morgan is Ronaldo's final straw his goodbye.  It's so sad that it's ended in such a manner but it was inevitable really it's been coming. Ronaldo doesn't suit Ten Hag's system that's a fact & cos Ronaldo is so egotistical he cannot accept that he's in decline that he's no longer need as he used to be.   I think the sooner the club terminate his contract the better than we can all go our separate ways & move on. It's for the best imo
The concept of support the Club at all costs is fanaticism. A player of Ronaldo's character wouldn't sabotage his memory nor history. We have been priveledged to get an inside look at the decline of a club we love. Inclusive of this we have been given a person's perspective of the relationship with another. Passive aggressive leaders are more dangerous than openly aggressive leaders and if  CR7 is saying that ten Hag is two faced then its something that needs examining. A lot of people are using Ronaldo's stats re goals and assists as justification for him being forced out, however strategically he is always marked by two players leaving us a player in advantage and this has hardly been used strategically to win games. Examine that as the use of resources during a game. At the end of the day, Ronaldo's legacy is assured, Ten Hag's will be determined by his success or failure and if he fails to win trophies, any and all talk of rebuilding doesn't amount to anything. SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER.
Ronaldo is great but not greater than manchester united. Good riddance to him.
He wanted out!
The thing is if we were losing games, there would be more support for ronaldo and put more blame on board... The thing that time is gonna come, u r naive if ten haag will take us to titles because u need club to be run properly, can't suppro ronaldo on everything, there is lot to read, people who complained about him not playing preseaskn and disrespected him when his child was I'll is criticising him for disrespecting others, hypocritic idiocy at its best
The Club is being exposed, good work Ronaldo! Sat in 5th place. What a joke
SEWWWWWYYYYY
Ronaldo's respect for Ten Hag was not lost in July it was lost when Ten Hag was boss of Ajax in the champions league back in 2018 when he played for Juventus.
WHAT DEAL did everyone turn down in summer 2022 ? What "deal" should we/ Ronaldo accepted ? I dont recall there being ANY offers Ronaldo or the club found acceptable ? Please enlighten me.
He was not ill.there were pics of him juggling balls in training the day b4 the Eufa game
Young uns want him gone and forgotten, old heads know he loves the club and hates what it’s become
He didn't go on the tour because he's wanted on charges in the USA? Why is no one mentioning that...
Glazers out 🔰🔰🔰🔰🔰
Glazers out, problem solved.
Ronaldo is the goat he was honest
Everything is about cr7 but all of this is to do with the club and what they are doing Glazers Out!
49:00 Real life advice there
Say what you want. We’ve played better without Ronaldo in the team. He’s past it. Doesn’t have the legs and now doesn’t have positioning either now too. Should hang up the old boots after this year.
GOAT 🐐 Manchester United greatest ever player 🌟 thank you
You can pull out all the interviews you like but how many people have been in interviews and lied their arse off? He has said Liverpool fans showed him respect at the loss of his child yet certain people at utd never.
the problem is he has mixed his issues if you want to go after the club do that only and finish why mix by attacking the coach and former players,thats why people are now calling him rubbish its all because of attacking the coach
Ten hag enters then club, been there for a couple of months does nothing special and people defend him. So he said that his excited to play with Ronaldo but barely played him, he obviously just said that at the start to appease the Ronaldo supporters. We don't know what happened for Ronaldo to say that about ten hag but he must have his reasons, it would be way different if he ways playing all the time and then he came out with this. Let's now forget when we hounded Mourinho out of the club because of what he said about some players and now we doing the same with Ronaldo for what he said about ten hag and glazers.
I actually think that (from the Glazers' perspective) it's a godsend he did this interview now and not in the summer.  Now the focus is going to be on Ronaldo Vs ten hag, and all the chaos that's created, whereas none of that would've really been there had he done it in the summer (if he got his move).  If he'd done it back in the summer, the headlines of the interview would've been the shambolic state of united under the glazers. Now, unfortunately, it's the whole 'ten hag doesn't respect me so I don't respect him' thing.
This club UNITED is bigger than anyone. I guess Pogba had issues with the club but not to this extent. UNITED was wrong to resign selfish CR7 and now we're paying the price. The Portuguese is too blind to admit that he can't cope with the demand of modern football. He is scared of the current challenges in the team and feel outshone by the emerging talents at the club. Instead of admitting this, he is now pretending to be betrayed by certain individuals. Mark should be ashamed of protecting this lazy player. CR7 has nothing to offer at this moment and time.
you wanted someone to call out the board and you got it, a voice for the fans.
Great take
Arsenal are massive
I was taught to take it both sides - mark goldbridge 2022
It's not all about his comments. Rather he clearly state that he has no respect for the manager so how come the chemistry between the two come to the ground. The club should get rid of this stupid cancer. Your stand isn't really expected from someone who cares about the club .
''There are so many angles in this interview''? Mate its simple as it can be..From the beginning of this seasin Ronaldo didnt show any respect towards his team mates, ten Hag, the club and the fans by staying at home during the pre season. While everyone was working their ass off; he was sitting at home. Then he walked out before the endsignal, then he refused to go on the pitch and now he blatanly lied about being ill and in stead of fighting for his team mates, club and fans he's giving an interview. Ey; talking about respect ey..Ronaldo out
Ronaldo is a knob Get rid
Mark do a live show during the interview
This is one of the best videos on TUS. Really liked Mark's take on the rollercoaster, it was so relatable to what I feel. Thank you for putting those emotions into words Mark. Love the work and content!
RONALDO LOVES THE FANS BOLLOCKS FLICKING THE PHONE OF A 9 YEAR OLD KID LOVES THE FANS DREAM ON
Please let people express their thoughts on this issue freely. Not everyone sees Ron like you do.
The hypocrisy and short-sightedness by some United fans 🤡
ronaldo is no saint, dont shoot the messager just look at the message. The club has been ruined. We somehow turn stars into tainted athletes. The bad apples were never Mourinho, LVG, Ole or ralf. Ralf said the truth and got fired. GLAZERS OUT
Listening to Mark Goldridge is retrogressive rather than progressive!!! Inasmuch as Ronaldo's comments had some positive vibes in it going forward towards the change of ownership campaign. But the moment he dragged Ten heg into this whole thing.that's where u should put a full stop!!! It's utter rubbish and disgusting! Don't care whether Keane o Beckham did it,it doesn't make it any right in 2022!!! Hypothetically even if there was some ounce of disrespect from Ten heg. At the end of the day he's the boss and the teams' leader. U can't say such stuff about him publicly!!! Unless if u are jus a troublesome kid!!! Fact! And about us not building anything under the Glazers. He's also playing a Ronaldo on Ten heg. O according to him if the Glazers were to live for further 50years and still be incharge of Man Utd. Man Utd won't win the league for another 50years????  Look;it will be slower than anticipated for Ten heg to do it; Maybe??? But with good signings even if it's 2per window. With time it will develop into a real potent and capable team to extremely challenge. Couple that with Ten heg's wits end craftiness. He will surely do it! Coz he's up there with the best tactically! SAF won the league with the Glazers!!!  Give Ten heg time and he will cross the line with Man Utd eventually. With o without the Glazers!!!  Remember my statement!!!!
Don't think anyone is going to be disagreeing with his assessment of how the club has been run. The ten hag stuff, that's too much. That's him creating a situation where the only outcome is him leaving whilst staying on board with fans. That's very sad. If you do an interview with piers moron you're not thinking clearly either
Ronaldo sud be sold.. He has become toxic.. United plays better when he is not in the team.. N he knows he is not the player he was before.. Get him out.. No player is bigger than the club...
Ronaldo should speak ON THE PITCH!!!! Score some fkin goals instead of acting like hes world best. You were the best in the world, but you are NOT anymore. Act accordingly. You are not bigger than the coach or the team.
What about what he said about Rooney?! Can't believe having that.
Glazers OUT!!! Ronaldo OUT!!! In Ten Hag we trust
I totally agree with Cr7. The Glazers and their mob which includes Ten Hag must go ASAP. They are the biggest problem at Utd. This is black and white to me. Glazers and Ten Hag and everybody involved with them must go. We need a total clear out. Ten Hag is no better than Ole and the other guy. Those still giving him the benefit of the doubt are the same people who gave Ole and Ralph the benefit of the doubt and the club
*SIU* ya later....
Why is every legend hating ManU ???….LVG and co said same thing so why all this about Ronaldo
Ronlado out
This is a sad a break-up. Yes, Ronaldo has called out the running of the club - but let's not pretend that Ronaldo did this interview for the love of United and the United fans - This is Ronaldo doing what is best for himself and using the narrative of the state of the club to get the support from the fans.
Hia levels of disrepect to the club is gone to new levels - digs at the manager, effectively insulting and bullying Rooney - abs disgusting behaviour. He is not saying ANYTHING that we all and people like Neville has been saying for years - the fact that he uses Piers Morgan for this interview is just evidence he is completely self-serving. Also, funny how he says United havent invested (which i agree they haven't), but stops short about how much they pay him - hypocrit
I have such mixed feelings about this. If he has spoken out about Glazzers and the hierarchy I am OK, but I don't care for him calling out Ragnick and EtH? I am sorry. He is out of form. It is clear to see. He lost a yard from last year, he's missed chances he usually didn't, he's made one decent pass the whole season and misplaced a bunch of them when we had the opportunity. I don't expect EtH to be soft on anybody and I sure don't expect EtH to help Ronaldo get his form back just in time for the world cup.
Just to clarify something about ronaldo speaking about Ralf Ragnick, it’s not him as a person, but him as a manager/coach which is correct, Ragnick was never at the level to coach United, as a director position sure, but as a manager definitely not, and I think that’s what he meant, but we need to see the full interview to know the context
I will wait for the transcript of the full article before commenting. However, I do know that anything related to Glazers, underpricing players and the way the club is managed, I will agree with CR7, but any pot shots at the coach and his so called love for club and fans, I will no doubt disagree
I knew that this shitberg is going to find a way to defend his boyfriend Ronaldo.
You clowns are still going to defend this arrogant narcissistic diva
So long Ronaldo, Viva Garnacho!!
willenhall red says , criticism of the manager ? since when do you respect the boss just because hes the boss  ? how many bosses are complete idiots , surely respect has to be earned
If you said you don't know how Ten Hag has disrespected Ronaldo, then you a re bloody English pretender.
Just appreciate what kind of job did Alex Ferguson did here...without anyone knowing about it 👍  Hats off..No manager come anywhere close 🙏
criticising the hierarchy is one thing but dropping a bomb shell like that shows he only think about him self. no doubt he is one of the greatest footballer of all time but he lacks responsibility and respect towards he s teammates and coach as whole Manchester united we both should be move on!!!
GET ten hag and ronaldo out of this club
Let’s get one thing straight: Ronaldo has won. Simple as.  He’s basically slammed United down to a lower tier of footballing club.  He’s said the club is run poorly, the facilities are crap, there is no ambition to compete with the best.  He knows no one of any high calibre is going anywhere near United now.  Sesko you can forget about, Schick as well.  He knows the damage to United will be tremendous to the point that Erik will now be so jeopardised in regards to trying to sign players because who of them will want to come when one of the greatest ever players is saying the football club is a complete joke??  The Glaziers will now have to sell or quite literally pour billions into infrastructure and try their absolute best to prove they’re not a joke of an ownership.
Aram is a prat
Glazers are the root cause of all the, now spiraling, problems faced by United
So he said something bad about the club and coach ohh ok well I don't care still my goat 😂😂
Stupid of Ronaldo mentioning Ten Hag. Its all about Ronaldo out now. The focus will be on those comments and not about the Glazers.  Glazers win once again.
willenhall red says  , why all the uproar  ? CRISTIANO is only saying what we all know , the club is run very badly,  the proof is in the results , no premier league since 2012 / 2013 , no trophy since 2016 / 17
This video is embarrassing. The level of mental gymnastics that Goldbridge does to defend Ronaldo is puzzling. I can't work out if he's doing it to keep his young / overseas fanbase who worship Ronaldo happy or whether he just lives up the guy's arse. Seeing a player who has disrespected the club so many times and acts like a petulant egotistical child, but yet gets praised for speaking the truth... its baffling to me.
One of the clubs biggest ever legends pissing all over it 😂😂😂😂😂
Ronaldo should never have gone back to such a half-assed team. Hope he gets out soon and goes to a good team who kick ass.
This is what you get when you bring in a 37year old fading star, and want to build your team around him. Echoes of Falcao, Ibrahimoviv, Cavani, Schweinsteiger, etc. No matter how good they were for a period, you can never build the future on such characters.characters. Signing these kind of players is a reflection of how badly the club is run.
Disgusting how muppets are criticising Ronaldo for this - he clearly loves the club and wants to expose the rot so we can finally move forward
I wish he had just come out with this in August - Glazers Out!
First of all, I totally respect him for calling out the owners of Manchester United. Something needs to change after 17 years of this shite. I am looking forward to watching the interview with his good friend Piers Morgan, which is going to be very interesting, but unfortunately, I have to say that CR7 is the past. Alejandro Garnacho is the future, and we need to move on. We make super stars at the club, and we all believe in Eric Ten Hag 100%. It has been a pleasure watching him over the years as the best player in the world, but nothing lasts forever. Well, life goes on, I guess.
Please get him out!
Ronaldo GOT RECEIPTS
Just my opinion, but could it be the Glazers want Ronaldo out due to his high wages and his merc isn't selling anymore. But ETH wants him to stay as a squad player but if it's coming from the top, how can ETH deal with that? Perhaps that's what Ron means when he says ETH has dis-respected him?? In other words, his manager didn't stick up for him!
Ronaldo doesn't need to show respect to a manager! Goodbye child!
But we’re clearly heading in the right direction with Ten Hag, proved it again last night fighting until the end. We all knowing the glazers need to go, but it’s his first season wtf was Ronaldo expecting, us to be going for the title? It’s because he’s at the arse end of his career and wants to keep bolstering his stats, and ETH is the first manager to put him in his place
How does this affect lebron's legacy?.
Nearly half a mill in 12 hours, amazing to see how much the channel has grown, big up the United stand
I support United not EGOS, hes not good enough anymore and can't handle it so decides to spit his dummy out
The rooney comment 🤣🤣
I respect CR7, probably the reason I got into football back in ‘06 and have followed him since…he’s probably right about the club and the politics that goes around and tbh ETH hasn’t done him any favours either but ETH is the boss right now and I’ll be backing him  Sad how things turned out to with Ronaldo…GlazersOut
I saw this coming at the end of last season tbh
I think the club is a  joke and should be folded.
Do I believe Ronnie or the club? 🤔 It's a no brainer, but there's more questions being raised by this interview. Well Done Mark. Brilliant analysis with perspective & nuance instead of the usual mob lynching from the media & Talksport especially. Why does Ronnie not respect Ten Hag? That's the question fans need to know the answer to. Was it to do with his family's health concerns? We can't really decide till we hear truths from the other side. We may never know. Keane is still a very well respected legend,  Fergie is still a legend too & look what happened with them, as you described.  My beloved club is a joke & has a very long way to go before it gets back to its reputation from the days of Fergie. The professionalism is unbelievably poor never mind the performances on the pitch. Oh, how we miss the days of David Gill. It's very depressing & very sad, but the whole truth over the fallout needs to be known before Ronnie is hung, drawn & quartered from the usual media torch bearing, hangman squad.  Even if Ronnie is vindicated, I'm sad to say the haters will still hang him. Ronnie has his faults BUT is it out of love for the club, it probably is, but some of our current players need to look in the mirror more before they even consider being the possibility of being a United great! Even Best with his misdemeanours is STILL an idol of this club. As Mark said, it's not black & white.
Appreciated his comments on how the club is managed.. but for me criticizing ETH crossed the line.. for me and assumingly to any manager/coach.. if you dont play u prove urself whenever u get ur chance on the pitch.. dont moan and focus on getting better
I don't think he has bad feeling with ETH but he said it to force move out. His interview was all we know it's true but noone said it, and I respect him for that. Glazers are killing our club completely.
CR7 You Will Always be THE GOAT ❤
Utd are strong in attack, we dont actually need CR, better to focus on  the new talent & potential than past glory
Goldbridge which manager have you really heard say that they don't want a player, especially when you know you can't get a replacement because of how the club is ran? Ten hag will never on socials say that a player is surplus.
Ronaldo we love you for eternity, GLAZERS OUT GGMU
Why didn't he say all these when he was playing constantly week in, week out last season?  Just because they relegated him to the bench, he now remembered that there was no growth in the club and the owners wanted him out..  Well..
We've wanted this for so long, yet we still argue irrelevant points! This should unite us against the board and glazers
makes me laugh that people are saying hes embarrassing the club, the fact is he felt embarrassed to see what the club had become, and the players are the ones cashing in their cheques without putting in the work.
Goldbridge quoting star wars and saying only Siths deal in absolutes, then immediately saying anyone criticising Ronaldo for this interview must be Glazers in, is the most Goldbridge thing in the world 🤣
I have to say fair play to Ronaldo he is saying get the Glazers out
No one would have complained if the manager was Jose Mourinho and not Eric Ten Hag 😉….
It is shameful for ronaldo.......he is not bigger zan the club...........he reassure how selfish he is......now ronaldo performance is like old car which needs to be garbaged out..........we support united not ronaldo........Ronaldo out
I love Ronaldo but it seems to me his EGO is out of control he demands respect from everyone but you have to earn respect and maybe Ten has seen Ron's EGO over stepping the mark.
i feel like Glazers want me to do some Occultism
Hopefully this will force Glazers to spend in January now.  They will try buy the fans again
He's unprofessional. There's no excuse.
His ill he needs help 👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️
We can chop it up how we like and break it down in every which way... But he's publicly stated that he doesn't respect the manager, therefore he's done at United.
Zlatan said it after he left! United still living in the past and the Training ground not up to standards for a big club like United😢
Love ronaldo hate glazzers .....
Love how many are defending Ronaldo over the manager, a manager who is finally turning us around. He is right about the club stuff. People forget that as great as he was for us he has looked like a shadow of his former self this season, when he has played, and has always put himself ahead of us consistently
I’m SO SO HAPPY he called the Glazers and the club out!!! Proves everything we’ve been saying RIGHT!
Said the same thing myself when i left the club kitchens are a joke and un safe
A top 5/10 player of all time saying this and highest goals in modern history… huge scalp for the glazers…
Ronaldo lays out some of the truth - that the club has stood still over the last decade in every conceivable way - but if he has criticised the manager in the manner he is reported as doing then he has to leave the club ASAP. EtH is doing a decent job, he has to clear away the accumulated debris of the last decade before the club can really move forwards and Ronaldo's presence is not helping this process. As fans we KNOW the club is being run very badly off the pitch but the manager has to be supported; for the first time in ages I have slivers of optimism because of this manager. Ronaldo is raging at the dying of the light; he isn't the player he was and never can be again. He was probably disappointed that no "big" club wanted him in the summer window but that's because no other club would pay the current player what United are paying him. Time to leave. The club has had better players than Ronaldo, lost them and survived. We will move forward without him.
If only Ronnie had done the interview in a Norwich scarf
10:27 Saying someone is excited and wants Ronaldo is part of his plan, is word of mouth? What did you see on the pitch? Lets be honest guys? Erik disrespected Ronaldo, his words didn't match action, who took a the mic to Ronaldo it was always on Erik, so he said what he said.
15:03 Mark Susbridge x
If only Ronaldo would've left Ten Hag, and Rooney out of this inter.view. He would be perceived as a saviour by the fans, but he decided to try to clear himself of all the blame and push it towards the menager who is the only one, who tries to rebuild the club
Fk Ronaldo get rid. Its just a Circus with him. Sick of hearing is name
Bo hoo Bo hoo Bo hoo.
You are disguised the man united never believed his child was ill yet you also dont believe he is ill now, interesting
😂 glad ur not coming out Mark
Glazers out Ronaldo out
It was not meant to end like this really sad💔
"I was taught to take in both sides".... 🤣 oh mark you're funny
Me me me me me he wants to grow up
I’ve just seen the interview and I want him gone. Maybe I’ll cool down eventually. I’m probably being slightly unreasonable, I accept that but right now that’s how I feel.
Ronaldo could punch ten hag and youd still defend him mark. Ronaldo isnt the sharpest tool in the shed and should be attacking the glazers who pay his wages, not the manager
Glazers must leave the club for good
How can it be acceptable that a player can call out the club he plays for publicly? Are we just gonna accept this from any player or just the boy wonder?
Ronaldo didn't say Ten Hag. English guys stop turning this... He said if the manager doesn't respect him, he wont respect him. I agree. Full stop.
Idiots saying Ronaldos out of order for what he said about Ten Hag lmao. Kids who don’t know how life works, have you never had a job? Because you like someone doesn’t mean everybody has to.
Get out of this club assole you should respect tenhag and moreover you are an old finished accept the facts
Thanks Mark for a sensible take on the situation ..   Should use this to drive the glazersout movement ..
Have to respect Ronaldo for coming out and speaking his truth
Well, now we certanly know where the dressing room leaks originated from...
Cristiano is speaking truths so if you wanna just critisize the guy, OK but that won't help United either.
45 specially 46 onwards
"You have to destroy it to rebuild it and they start with me." 💔
GLAZERS OUT
Man Utd spend millions of pounds on players. They bought players like Pogba, Alexis Sanchez and Di Maria. Eriksen and Casemiro also joined this year. But they keep complaining about their owners every year. Man Utd is that rich brat child who is the envy of the lesser privileged children but still cribs about not having enough.
Where was pogba in all this???
Ronaldo is not a team player..
i just hope this club will never prosper again for a long time keep chasing your top four for eternity
I believe in 10 years the way we will look back on this interview will probably depend on how Ten Hag does. If he wins a big title like uel ,ucl or league in next 4-5 years cr7 will come of the worse but if he does not win anything big i think cr7 will be praised for doing this. In long term though in 25 to 30 years in terms of the histroy of sports this sport and the legacy of cr7 this will not affect him. Cause people always remember who won how much and he is the biggest winner this sport has probably ever seen.
LETS NOT FORGET THAT WE ONCE SAID HERE THAT GLAZERS DON'T WANT RONALDO TO GO FOR COMMERCIAL REASONS.. IS THAT STILL TRUE?
everyone saying glazers out was wishing for this day, and now it’s came no one’s taking the chance to get a good foot in actually getting new owners.
He's right about how the club is run, however he's the one who is trying to get out the club not the club pushing him out, He isn't playing because his form is poor.
what a shame for Man United, toxic club, no more love from me!
Fucking hell, Mark just gets better and better. Good luck to him.  Peace and Love
Ronaldo for me will forever Be a united LEGEND! He spoke out on how badly the club is run where some other legends for united don’t. Plus he even went to the state that if they want a massive rebuild and they start with me I’ll be happy with that to see United great again! He may have single handily forced the glazers to SELL
Ronaldo will always be a legend, it sad to see how the fans have allowed the media to destroy his reputation. Its very clear that there been a consented effort to drag his name. In as much as no one is above the club, we all human and putting myself in his shoes i don't blame him. Thanks for giving more balance review, why ill always appreciate this channel.
I wonder if he will refuse his next £510 million pay cheque!
He's done it to help himself !
Can't see how he says they stopped him moving in the summer, yet they're trying to force him out! Seems contradictory. The truth is the club has bad owners and a bad board, yes we know that, but the other truth is Ronaldo isn't performing! And this is PR to deflect away from the fact that age has caught up with him and he's protecting his brand. Ten hag is a manager who picks the players who will get him wins, not just now but also going forwards, THATS HIS JOB!! He's shown that dropping Maguire, wan bissaka, Henderson. He's not someone who plays people on reputation! That's a good thing!!
Well damn!
Mark Let me say it for you because you're a Prat "RONALDO GET OUT OF MY CLUB" you've been a waist since you came back
Ronaldo left, won 4 ucls, came back and the toilet seats are still the same 🤣
Hopefully my work disrespect me and still pay me £500k a week.
Banter club
GOLDBRIDGE GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF RONALDOS BACKSIDE!
Unpopular opinion: Ronaldo was one of the reasons the club started to stagnate.  Ferguson basically relied on him for everything, and when he left, Rooney and Van Persie were able to save the show for a little longer.
was thinking the club probably trying to find a way to pay off the right people until wednesday to try and get interview pulled and that reminded me... who was it that said a few weeks ago that united would pay him a fortune to keep his mouth shut if he said everything he knows about the running of the club
Manchester United don’t deserve Ronaldo, you’re a legend and always will be, what some of the Man Utd players don’t like is that he is football legend and they will never be and when he retires from football,  people still be talking about him, which you can’t say about any present Man Utd player apart from De Gea.
Pep is hated by his former players. He acts like an angel in public and they said he is a snake.  Ten Hag didn't respect Ronaldo. You should watch his interviews. Ronaldo should have been left in the summer if they respected him.
JG can't silence Goatnaldo with his scary lawyers.
Now it's Rangnicks time for an interview
Ultimately this is stupid he has done this. In the context of last season ten haag is doing a good job and this hinders him, Ronaldo is undermining him and is wrong for that. However I completely understand everything he has said, he’s getting criticism from washes out players younger than him, the club is a shambles since he left the first time, and it’s completely understandable that he feels forces out. Just look at the type of players who all got second chances and have ousted Ronaldo like rashford who walked in the Derby’s last season. However Ronaldo should have fought for his place as ten haag will give him a spot if he starts early it. This interview is definitely the end and he deserves to be sold now, he’s also left a lot of his legacy in the balance
Please guys don't make it ETH vs Ronaldo. We got to stick together against GLAZERS. GLAZERS OUT!!!
This Channel should be renamed to The CR7 Stand. So so biased stance!
CR37 is a moron end of
Mark, always watch the content, agree totally about not taking sides which is ridiculous but saying Ole was completely rubbish with the signings- in hindsight that maybe so but you really backed them at the time - particularly Sancho - just seems a bit hypocritical that’s all.
Does look bad for potential players coming to a badly run club (allegedly)
Mark...I am sorry to say but you and Ronaldo are just being hypocritical.  Ronaldo never call the Glazier out directly he was speaking in gibbrish but yet he can conviniently talk down at ETH. All ETH have showed that man is pure respect. And let me remind you again Mark, when Ronaldo took time off during pre-season remember that that was when he spoke out his interest of leaving and at the least have not even met ETH then, that was when he start flirting with every UCL club out there and being rejected even then, ETH defended him and from all indication, he never mentioned to the new manager nor the board that this is what he is going through; nobody in their right mind will not support him at that time. From where I am from you don't give yourself leave when you are sick or a family member is sick without proper request from your employer and really that is all it takes. So he has no story against ETH, he can say anything about how the club being run but to bring ETH in it, proves only one thing; Ronaldo is clearly part of the dressing room problem just as Pogba and Lingard was and he is still leaving in the past so he needs to go as he is looking down on ETH and I for one will not stand for that
I wish someone at nufc had the GUTS to call ASHLEY out over the past 14 years at my club. Truth hurts sometimes
When was it recorded?
Totally missing the point Mark. All the crap about the club is a smokescreen to lay the blame away from Ronaldo. And it's nothing new to anyone. This is to manufacture a move away. Who's gonna take him now? NOT a team player and it's a total circus around him. Probably cause a problem in the Portuguese world Cup camp now too
Ronaldo to, Roma,
Solksjaer was not a good manager, but he is a decent human being: beyond football is life. How do you even begin to ask someone to leave their sick child for preseason? PRESEASON.  Following your heart is overrated.
The glazers did the same with the shopping malls they bought apparently. Did virtually zero Maintenance or future proofing and let them degrade to the point they sold them off!
This interview is bringing a lot of Glazer fans out
Lost respect for CR7
i am glad he has made the comments on incompetence but his own incompetence as a player at this time is why ETH is not playing him. the man has been almost useless this season
Situation around ronaldo changed in July before that he never said he wanted to leave and post that it was all messy between the club and ronaldo. The story of disrespect and no trust on his daughter's situation broke the relationship between the two makes total sense.
NUFC will take him on loan for his experience.🙏
The Villa game shows the players downed tools
Maybe he wants his contract ending so he can move on. His clock is ticking and doesn't want to end his career like this.
Divided fc
Isn’t this the interview that was meant to come out in august? If he had left ?
Ronaldo out now!!!!
Whats he prattin on about respect. Hes a paid employee.
Another W for the goat
Glazers out will be the only solution
The club has been on decline since the Glazer's used it as a cash cow.
To say he doesnt respect the manager whilst your still under contract is absolute disgrace. Hes bitter because he cant accept he is past his best. Terminate his contract todaya and save £500k a week until Jan. In Ten Hag we trust.
How can you say he wanted a move in the summer, but the club wouldn't let him go. But he said that he felt forced out? Biggest contradiction I've heard
If there is someone who must be supported now, it is Ten Hag. I can imagine that Ronaldo is "disrespected" by Ten Hag because Ronaldo is a sub on every second match.
Careful with the Michael Jordan comparison. MJ went out on top after winning a championship. It was probably lucky for him that the Bulls chose to rebuild with young players and not bring back the then costly roster. We will never know. MJ may have not been able to have pull it off again (but fortunately went out on top). In contrast, I think we are all realising now that Ronaldo might be seeing out his career with a slow and painful demise.
I will not watch Manchester United anymore
Goldbridge you are not a footballer, so shut the fuqk off
Y'all having mouth because you're getting some crappy wins, yeah continue disrespecting Ronaldo and we wish y'all good luck
I don't respect Ronaldo for this. If you really love the fans you would have never done this. He's a coward, why is this coming out now. Because he's half way across the world doesn't have to face the music. Coward
Did erik ten hag won any European Championship? The answer is no! So story is the over.
Can anyone monitor the hair cuts 😂
If you want to give the top club scorer only 4 min playtime, not play to players strengths... Any person with eyes can see that eric ten hag is, was trying to humilate cr7... Manchester can't deny there is a pattern occurring here.
he didn’t choose Manchester city and return to MU only to leave like this is sad. He risked himself going back to a struggling team to try and help and now he is paying the price for such a return. so i trust ten hag
He said in other to make something new we have to destroy the old....... Indeed
Rotten from top to bottom, riddled with disease. 🔰GLAZERS OUT 🔰
My man Ronaldo is on his Kanye arc rn💀
Glazers out but will they?😢i am losing hope
That is the problem with the interview his petulance on Ten Hag, Rangnick and Rooney has ruined what he has to say.
Goldbridges stay in your lane.
Don't care United or glazers but the truth should be told.
I sincerely hope this is not goldbridge defending ronaldo.
If Ten Hag is one of those who questioned Ronaldo's commitment when he decided to stay with his stick 3-month old daughter, is it really wrong to call him out? He's not criticising Ten Hag's football, but for a lack of respect, which could be the above.
Proud of Ronaldo. I thank him for risking his legacy by calling out the owners.
If ten hag liked him and he didn't have that sad loss and he was scoring and winning . He wouldn't moan about how the club is run or the state of it .
this was after the city game
Agree with many things he says. But I’m sorry, he’s not playing well personally. You can’t just blame everyone else. If we fall on side with Ronaldo, why not pogba?
Ronaldo says he doesn't respect Tenhag but neither does he respect Ragnick who he says is not even a coach but guess what Ragnick gave his a chance and he scores more than 20goals.Ronaldo has no respect for anyone.He feels bigger than the clun
The club ran badly but can’t agreed that we can’t complete with arsenal or even Liverpool! As Man City no one on earth can complete with the national team of Abu Dhabi
Ive been waiting for this torpedo from Ronaldo since he said all will be revealed when he thought he was getting a move.
it's perfect time now to call out at the glazers
Glazers out
Ronaldo just made sure no one signs for you lot on jan he criticised you're training ground you're tech you're manger you're x manger you're bored lord have mercy he just buried united and goldy here is probably still gana back him
Now your talking Glazers need to go!!!!!NOW
It all starts and the top and that's where my blame lies the Glazers!!!
Ronaldo definitely pointed out problems with the club that most of us already knew are there.  However he seems to blame ETH for a lot of things that are not his fault. I can’t thing of a single time publicly ETH has ever said a bad word about Ronaldo. To say ETH doesn’t respect him is certainly out of left field.
DANCE    🤡  😆😂🤣
You should rather see it as he was going on the glazers out, he had to throw the manager under the bus for that reason
You can't call people idiots bro. It's like you're siding with him while we all haven't seen the whole interview..
Mark lives sooo far up to Ronaldo’s arse it’s unbelievable.
I dont like the rangnick ten hag parts but about the club and the state of decay that the club is in he isnt the first one to have said it: mourinho, lvg, zlatan, herrera etc and most importantly the majority of the fans so parts of this interview can be used as a glazers out propaganda
now is about CR7 u try to do damage control why not have the same energy u have when talking about Pogba. ur trash talk is so obvious
Suuuuuuuiiiiii united fans
Please get out glazer from our club
Glazers out!!!!!!
At this point Glazers out, Ronaldo out and let ETH do his work and bring glory.
Anyone who has watched football for a while, knows who Rangnick is, in a champions league semi finals of 2011 knows that he was the coach of Schalke 04. He is right about so many things, but I think he should have been sensitive on the questions about ETH or RR or the team. Whichever way it goes, I wish someone could pickup on what he has said about the management of the club.
United may take legal action
I sense a "mutual contract termination" coming.
The worst thing to happen since Fergie left is players doing interviews!! If he truely loves the club he would of kept his mouth shut until the summer considering the upward trajectory we are on...
I agreed with his comments on Ralf Ragnick..no one even heard of him but he becomes manager of United then you get this channel acting like they knew Ralf since he was a child
ETH will try and keep  the team positive and publicly back all players to get the support of he's team the club is constantly leaking information and stories about ronaldo and people think thats respect and professionalizm
Honestly if I was him and I wasn’t believed about my daughter the respect I had for you would be gone because I feel like you think that little of me to think that I would lie about that so even if I liked you I wouldn’t like you anymore
Ronaldo's gone and done a princess Diana!!
He’s salty because ETH doesn’t give him game time, and because the owners wouldn’t sell him. The problem is, he’s just too old. Needs to look in the mirror.   Mark trying to make this about a Glazers out movement is reaching. It’s unprofessional from Ronny, end of story.
I think breach of contract is another way out. And at this point his career he is telling us what is really going on. No real investment in the club and they shouldn't have brought him back if they weren't going to use him fully. I like Ten Hag but he feels how he based on how he's treated being there. I hope he gets to leave and end his career on a high. The Glazers need to go and even more so now
You want to believe he loves the fans but the fact is he loves himself. I fully believe he likes the fans but I believe more he’s using the mass number of fans to make himself look better here.
I always think that nobody is bigger than the club but when there is situation like this when a club is not being managed and improved properly for over ten years,any players have the right to call this club out and throw the club under the bus. It has to be done
If he never said the Erik ten Hag stuff, the media would've focused on the ACTUAL problems at the club that he highlighted.
Mark doesn’t want to loose Ronaldo fanboy’s subscriptions and memberships 😂😂😂
The club is a sh*t show, but to do this interview was a mistake especially when you are still a player of the club. Things could have been handled differently by both the club and Cristiano.
I fear for Man United people and they ego can't see not Evan half of all this. I fear another great club soon will be brush under the carpet.  ARE YOU GUYS REALLY PREPERE FOR ANOTHER 15 YEARS WITH OU A TITLE . yes criticise CR7 , and keep on middle table,. You guys just send off a futere word cup Champion and top score as well .
I genuinely believe Ronaldo and ten hag were on it together. The Picasso quote kinda hints towards it. he had to expose the ownership. it's a win win not does he get his contract terminated but forces a January transfer which wasn't the plan before.ik it seems kinda far stretched but look at the consequences they favour ten hag to make the club better and Ronaldo also wins.we all know Ronaldo loves the club like he legit played right after his son died that's commitment right there.
Ronaldo wasn't bashing Rangnik but the people who gave him the Coaching job...that was a huge mistake
United have problems for sure but disrespecting Ten Hag whos actually trying to fix those issues its a problem,I stand with Ten Hag
It's laughable that people still believe the narrative that Ronaldo loves or cares about United.
He must of done this interview after Rooney made his comments about whether he was good enough to play at united anymore
just pathetic that such a player with his status now that he is no longer performing, starts dirtying his own nest and blaming others.  get out please
While I agree with his comments about the club, he cannot be doing interviews like this while he is still employed by the club.
Glazers out. Worst owners in world sport. Hate them.
Was his daughter the child that died ?
Ten Hag was always being politically correct when he talked about Ronaldo, so that doesn't mean that he respects Ronaldo
We all know the club is run poorly but to call out the manager thats selfish, the team plays better without him evidently from the results and final 3rd transitions. It's good he did the interview so that the club can release him and put this soap opera to bed. I will remember what he did for the club but the club failed ETH when they decided not to release him in the summer.
This interview is gold and green! The time is now! Glazers OUT
Ronaldo didn’t do anything wrong and I am with him because you can’t treat a legend like that
He has told the truth
How matter if he or ten hag disrespect any other one first, how is this issue even a good thing for the club or himself
I think if the stuff about his daughter is true, then Ronaldo wanting to leave Man Utd is something I can understand. His family comes first.
Everyday when things don’t go well we get news “ sources from the dressing room says ..” and hapless united fans believe those like the whole truth but here is Ronaldo putting himself in the front and spitting truth and these guys just are bashing him.
Time to go ronaldo.
I agree with some of what he said like how badly the clubs run and the lack of success we have had since he left the first time but I strongly disagree with him disrespecting the previous and current managers! He is a legend of this club in my opinion but it’s just for the best that he leaves now and it’s such a shame but I’ll be glad to see the back of him now
he is Man Utd legend. always be. but this time, he went against the club. still love him but he need to find another club now. good luck to him.
Ronaldo's clever with that summer story about his daughter. All the while his agent was actively looking for clubs to sign him and they all turned Ronaldo's camp down. He refused to accept lower wages to move and that why he missed pre-season. Using that made up story about his daughter is very classless from him. Even after refusing to come on V Spurs that punishment was soft from ETH and his still made captain for a game a few weeks after. If ETH still does all this how does he not respect or value you. The whole football World know United are not where they should be and your manager says it every week. This was very counter productive and will definitely tarnish his image. Will probably to go Portugal of the state after this. No top team will take him.
It's good that he called that Club is not run properly but to say something about ETH is just disgraceful
Let's wait for the full interview before we jump into any conclusion. But the manager calling is abit disappointing from Ronaldo especially after what he did at the spurs game.
A once great player but he's gone of the boil the manager can't keep playing him
I honestly believe Ronaldo doesn’t truly care about the Glazers or how the club was run (he didn’t seem to care last year when he was performing well). He’s just using this as a mechanism to force a move away as he’s finally come up against a manager that keeps his ego in check and he can’t handle it.
I really respect your unbiased perspective regardless of public opinion
If you don't do anything just blame the club! Ronaldo betrayed united to searching other clubs in last transfer market.
Why do an interview with Piers Morgan of all people
Haha.   Would you look at that.  Who would have thought Ronaldo would be the sacrificial lamb.
How is putting this interview publicly showing any love for his fans?
I think ten hag didn't want ronaldo all along but was forced by glazers to keep him so he was made to be in the team and ten hag just did what he is doing now to wan bissaka
Mark, most people doesn't like the way Ronaldo behaved but that doesn't mean the same people supporting Glazers.
But that's not true.Manutd let Ronaldo stay away from the presesaon
WELL!  This is so so sad ...  how a dream return has turned so sour.    Only at Man United could this happen!  It doesnt matter whos wrong or right but what DOES MATTER is Glazers as owners  have allowed this to happen and again they have failed the player and club.   How many more times do they want players to slam the club ... again the club is embarrassed.
Mark, of all ppl, I’m amused that you’re buying this scripted interview from Piers show??? One a snake & one is narcissist… you’re saying about EXPOSING, exposing what? We already know that the Glazers run this club horrendously more than a decade… why’d now he’s saying that his daughter hospitalised NOW? Why not during the summer? Just simply post in his BIG IG account & nothing will be shady & all… what I’m seeing with all these scripted comments we’re gaining sympathy from all of us about his daughter, gaining the fans support from the fans who support Glazers out movement… this is all about him wanting to get out of the club final attempt & wants the fans still love him… clear as day & we’re all divided by both snake & narcissist…
come on everyone calling ten haag a lier what's he supposed to say ronaldo doing an explosive interview so we though best not to play him
ETH never disrespected Ronaldo. He just ruined all the chances he got from ETH, even Garnacho’s more effective and productive😪. It hurts tho.
Imagine moaning about 500k a week. Ronaldo has completely lost touch with reality. Quicker he goes the better.
my main issue is that Ronaldo would not have been a whistleblower if he was scoring goals/playing well
Regardless of how bad the club is run what he’s done is unacceptable and wouldn’t be accepted if ANY other player did this so yes it is as simple as get out of my club. We already know what state the club and its facilities are in ronaldo didn’t need to go on an international stage and drag this club through the mud just because he can finally see that he isn’t good enough. This is the club that we ALL love and he’s just gone and disrespected it while we’re playing the best football we’ve played for years anybody advocating this or tryna find ways to defend his comments can’t care about this club as much as they say they do.
1:27 mark already tryna create avenues to defend this behaviour… I’m not even listening to this video
Love ronaldo but this is so out of order. So he feels disrespected by ten hag. Well what about the fans cristiano? We were told you were sick and couldn’t play yesterday. So you lied to the fans and would rather slate the club than play yesterday and actually help us get back to where we should be. Sitting talking to piers Morgan doesn’t help. And you didn’t look ill during that interview either! And also cowardly to do it when your taking off for Qatar leaving ten hag and our club hanging by a thread cause you wanted to make it about you. Cheers ronaldo
Selfish player. Not a club legend
I disagree he can say what he wants some of ten hags decisions aint been great
Morgan he's a stirrer he would have loved doing this
He missed pre-season because of family issues! Then gets canned whe he comes back? Great coach that ten hag keep sticking up for him.
TAKE IN BOTH SIDES😁😂😂😂
Ronaldo's interview is a blessing why ??? Glazers out 👀 is going to explode now🔥🔥
He’s doing nothing on the pitch to get some airtime so he may as well stay relevant by doing “explosive” interviews.
Utd are bigger than Ronaldo 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️  We move………..
Sad end to Ronaldo’s career. Who’d sign him now.
WAZZA is the greater legend than CR7 . GLAZERS OUT
Ronaldo has though united under the bus
Ronaldo have to goooooooo let's move on Ronaldo out
Time to move on..., we have Garnacho now. It's a new era and Ronaldo wasn't performing like he has in the past. Sad to say and thanks for all the great memories but your time is up.
Ronaldo has alot of reasons to go its not his fault he the goat
Ronaldo could have stabbed a toddler and mark would still try blame the toddler
Ronaldo started the circus and blames everyone else than himself.Sad!!!
R7 can goooooooo please goooooooo your old  gooooooooo
Ronaldo is certainly more right than wrong. I hope they can just terminate his contract now and put an end to this.
where can i watch the full interview?
Think he hit a lot of nails on the head but saying he doesn’t respect ETH is the end for him. The fans have his back over Ronaldo. He’s not in the team as he’s been pants. Was nice knowing you CR be seeing you!
🔰 Glazers Out 🔰
He is wrong about ETH, he even made him captain.
‼️‼️‼️Glazers OUT this is ridiculous exposed how can thing not change over this period of time 20 years GLAZERS OUT NOW‼️‼️‼️
If he had of stayed away from the Ten Hag the interview would be great. My GOAT
Look it's still petulant, the team is playing better without him and he can't accept that. He was upset with the club before ten hag arrived and he's just added ten hag to his hit list as he can't accept been on the bench..
I can’t believe how many Ronaldo dickriders there are in the comments. Yes he did mention fair points about the club being in shambles, however he had no right to disrespect Rangnick, Rooney and especially Ten Hag in the middle of the season. He could’ve left last summer but no one wanted him. He just deflected the blame of his poor performances on anyone but himself. It’s just pathetic.
I’m agreeing with cr7, ETH is overrated.. he’s not going Anywhere to win anything.. the game is so boring.. he’s not the man..
This must just be the final straw for the Glasers, he is the first superstar and curent player to put the club in bad but realistic light. I love Cristiano, I live United and that's why I hate the Glasers! We want Glasers out! We want Glasers out!
Ronaldo going after people's appearances, literally schoolyard bully behaviour. What a sad manchild.
If he had an interview and only complained about the state of the club would have been fine and would have put pressure on the glazers. Complaining about the manager is horrific, people are defending him for winning trophies with us over 10 years ago. If this was Ferguson we would all say the same thing. Time to go
When mark said he was thaught to take it both sides 🤣🤣🤣then says no that sounds wrong
Goldbridge on a big arse covering mission for the next few days.
Full respect to Ronaldo. Kept all this under wraps til now. He could of easily created a storm during the active season
Ahh! Here we go another drama
Most of what Ronaldo said was all about Ronaldo… he exposed himself as the selfish narcissist that I’ve denied him to be for years
Why does Mark keep saying people are Glazers in? Haven't heard a single person say it. It's such a ridiculous accusation.
Manchester United has problems with players with c-vac issues. Sancho has heart problems because of vacs and so does Lindelof. Lindelof is not as serious as Sancho who has bad case of blood cloths.
Ronaldo only wants utd to pay him off. Hes selfish arrogant
Ronaldo will always be the Greatest Of All Time in my eyes!!❤️🐐 My relationship with MUFC will be different moving forward. Ronaldo is the last of the old school!!
He’s attacked the manager - he can sod off
Support Cristiano! What has that bald dutch prink done?
He's not been prem class for a few years...at this point he is just an embarrassment.
He acted like a man child towards Carragher and Neville just because they "disrespected" him when they just criticised him. Just because he is one of the best players to have ever played football in the world doesn't make him immune from criticism and it definitely doesn't give him the right to freely criticise others with no consequences. He is acting as if he is god and that he should be untouched and allowed to do as he pleases. As soon as he came into the club it ruined the momentum some of the other players were on, more prominently Bruno. This whole season he has been nothing but frustrated as he has been unable to deliver. If he really wanted the club to succeed, instead of crying about not playing he would be trying his best to prove himself and unfortunately he hasn't been able to do so this season. ETH has his view on how he wants HIS team to play and Ronaldo doesn't suit that. On the other hand, yes there are issues with the club and how it is run at higher levels and it is good to hear about those issues so that they can be addressed and changed for the better but calling out the manager does nothing but harm the club as now the players will question ETH. The guy is an idol to those players around him and the power he gets from that can manipulate the decisions those players make.
Glazes out
Ronaldo HATES THE GLAZERS SO MUCH he lets them pay him 500k per week, even when ronaldo refuses to play to earn them wages
This season will be though Newcastle is coming and top four will be challenging if Newcastle go to top four then next season they will be more strong arsenal is coming Manchester city will be there and one position four club competing for that
You’re kidding yourself if you think the media will see this as a criticism of the Glazers… I’ve loved and respected CR7 for decades.. but alongside his other childish personal attacks on other players, he can basically f**k off
When fans support a player more than their manager and club, then that club has problems...Club before players people
The fact he chose to do the interview with Piers Morgan tells you everything you need to know about Cristiano. Disgrace. Vegas 09.
Why people slander OGS the signings he made performed for him. Only two managers got 2nd with utd it’s mourinho and ole. He got utd in uel final and literally has the record for longest undefeated run away from home all while doing it with a smile
He exposed the whole system. And ETH if he was not in his plans why he said to the press he is in our plans. PSG said to some players you can find new club as you people not in our plans.
🫣🫣🫣 if you see ten haag post match interview he knew interview was about to come out
Stunlock Bridge
Shaka saying this interview doesnt help anyone at man utd jist shows hiw much they actually know abkut the situation at man utd. They shouldnt be allowed to speak on it
If Ronaldo leaves this club and Maguire and Phil Jones are still there,  proves his point how bad this club is run
Let’s be honest, how many people need to say how the state of the club is? People need to see the bigger picture and not be stupid and say to get Ronaldo out of the club. Before we start judging we gotta wait to hear the full interview. But what it all ties down too is the cancer in the club named the Glazers and how they’ve destroyed us! Ronaldo is saying what the fans feel!
When legend says something you need sit quite and listen.......this is not same United which we use to support before
Go on Ronny you out this shambles of a club
The destruction didn’t start with him. Don’t be dumb. It started with pogba and lingard and some others from last season.
Yes Ronaldo, finally someone has the balls to come out against the club. He loves Manchester United, he his a legend of the club and he is so upset with the way the club is being run and feels he has to speak out about it. I can imagine a lot of the players complaining amongst themselves about all these issues  ut not having the front to rebel. Well done Ronaldo!
You wouldn't disrespect anyone if they didn't disrespect you first. When Ronaldo said the club didn't sympathise with him when his child was in the hospital and he had to miss preseason, it's clear he was referring to Ten Hag. If that's the case, then I don't think Ten Hag only disrespected him, he also disrespected his whole family. Unfortunately, not everyone has got brains to understand the interview.
The fact that he had to be convinced by sir Alex to reject Manchester City says it all really. The man never cared for anything but himself.
I'm guessing a huge part of Ronaldo's beef with Rangnick is because the latter's rebuild doesn't involve him and could possibly be one of the people "forcing" him out. Still too much missing pieces for now though so i will just assume that some highlighted points were taken out of context.
Ronaldo must bounce out of the club.
Fans should not only point out Ronaldo's comments on ten haag and rangnick, we have to see the bigger picture! The glazers' situation will get way worse before it gets better, but we can only move forward.
All the comments hating on Ronaldo, maybe you don't agree with everything he said.  Is this not the push we need to remove The Glazers?!?!? He has the biggest voice. Rangnick said it but, everyone just said who?! 🔰🔰🔰
All the social media accounts and popular channels are holding on the line with what Ronaldo has said about Ten Hag and Ragnick but nobody is highlighting the points he said about the GLAZERS and the club. That's pathetic
Ronaldo is a club legend and always will be but he has over stepped the line. He has done similar things at utd first time, real Madrid and juve. I think he can't deal with getting old and not being as good as he was. Happens to us all. Wouldn't be surprised if utd took him to court (which I wouldn't agree with).
But why mention this in this way? I see it as being unprofessional, Ten Hag treated everyone equally. Family over football always and I hope Ronaldos daughter is much healthier but not like this man...I agree with the club being run terribly but not the coach man
Ha ha ye said United aren't at the same level as City ha ha he knows .
Mark, I agree with most of what you said, But…  No legend of ours van seriously consider going to our rivals.   There is mo possibility.  Ronald knew. We were shocking before he came.   Going to city would have done what?  Come on.
13:42 survive you will, bloody newcastle in third in the league.
Glazers out!!
Ronaldo is a disgrace
Glazers out!!!!!!!!
In all honesty, ten hag is keeping the glazers on life support
Cristiano leaving will have the same effect as pogba leaving..Will be better for it
Unprofessional. Disloyal. Egotistical. Petulant. Arrogant. This is the legacy of CR7 at United now. Simple as.
Ronaldo shoulnt blame ETH for his performance. Ronaldo should be blamed for thinking that he will be the same year after year until he decides when to quit. Man, our human bodies pass thru stages of life, however much you excercize. Evrybody knows including ETH know that the club is run badly. should we expected every player to revolt on the club, talk rubish instead of constractive criticism? Ronaldo, grow up. Even in Spanish team , you will be blamed for lots of misses. You wont perform like previous World cup. You bet.
If he talked about this after losing 0-4 to Brentford, it would understandable. But, now when they are winning and playing great without him in the team. It is just pathetic, selfish diva.
Glazers out
How if all calm down until we all see the interview, before judging anyone?   Ps: Teen Merd is of course laying and some people falling for it!  And Rangnick is known for destroying clubs everywhere he goes! I live I Germany and see everything Rangnick touches dies...he is really bad in his job...
Ten hag is never going to be in control of this club as long as the glazers are there this a good fortune ppl are not seeing the benefit of this interview an actual player who plays for the club at present exposed how the club is run and basically saying they are backwards
He says it well about how the club, that they aren't doing enough but what he said about Erik, maaan no no no you are talking like a child
We don't have to pick sides
He played after his child died and then they disrespected him like that
I think Ronaldo was exactly what this club needed to shake this club out of its slumber. Someone with the status and courage (or arrogance) to take on the situation. Of course it’s very selfish of him to do it, and he was definitely not a constructive participant, but o think United s ways needed a shake up.
Where can I watch the full Ronaldo video ?
The, I'm not going on tour after handing in his transfer request might not be what EtH expected from Ronaldo.
It's Pierce Morgan. He hates ETH.
mark is it ten hag’s ego and stubborness why he chose not to play ronaldo against man city ten had did the same against spurs asking to come on in the last minute mark of course he will not respect ten hag which player will respect their coach all ten hag did make an excuse why he didn’t play him in the man city game.
Which player in their right mind is coming to United after this?
Listen I love Ronaldo but everyone saying at least he had the balls to talk while he's a current player makes me wonder if he was still first choice would he of done any of this
Hopefully Ronaldo’s intentions was to get the glazers out of his boyhood club. He even said that he preferred the club when SAF was there. The problem with this club starts at the top, with the Glazers. He came back last season and hoped things would’ve changed but they never. So, he got mad and decided to take matters into his own hands. He’s trying to help the club, but at the same time almost tarnishing his name. I will always love Ronaldo and respect his as a United legend, hopefully he and all the fans, get their wish for the Glazers to be gone.
MU fans are delusional borderline stupid. Ten Hag always wanted Ronaldo out before he came he just lied to seem like the good guy. MU fans are so stupid thinking Ten Hag would lie on TV🤦🏻‍♂️  The disrespect MU and fans have towards for what Ronaldo has done. Fans hating on Ronaldo for staying with his daughter is beyond idiotic. MU fans deserves the Glazers!
A lot of previous players have said the same thing.
Ralfnick will drop his interview soon
Mark says he doesn't live in absolutes but then when we call out Ronaldo we are def glazers in 🤡
We are truly a finished club and we can’t doubt that
Why on earth are people sticking up for him? He's publicly coming out and making a mockery of the manager yet again. Mark you wouldny have a bad word said about him. You talk about agendas but if this was another player coming out with this you'd be all over them
Ronaldo is like a husband who is criticising his marriage....poor bedroom...kitchen...etc He wouldn't get it anyway he's not married
This interview is not bcoz he loves the club but he love himself...he can't even take a criticsm from his old colleague...now he even mention Rooney in his interview...
But he never criticised Ole,he is clueless!!
Why do you keep calling him a legend of Man United. For goodness sake. He is a legend of Real Madrid not Man United.
Just leave the club.
Some utd fans act like ETH is a god it’s laughable
Mark... Exactly like you said, I am just feeling sad. This isn't the way it should have ended for Ronaldo here. Legend for me still.
Thank you ronaldo 🙏 another good information to walk the glaziers out
Glaziers out
Glaziers out
Glaziers out
Lives not like that
Glazers out
GLAZERS OUT
Mark he said he didn't understand the move of a sporting director as a coach to MU  And he doesn't recognise him as a coach (in that way he doesn't know him)  English is 2nd language so try no take things literally
It is sad to end this between CR7 and Club, Glazers Out
He might be the GOAT  player once but he is now the GOAT traitor cos no matter how you feel about the club or our manager, having a sit-down with Piers Morgan of all people is “madness”. We are now on the right trajectory and this move could derail our journey. There’s a TIME n PLACE for this sort of things CR7. Tnx for confirming what footballing world thinks of you now💯🙁
Ronaldo played his last game for Utd.  Glazers OUT!
To all the fools who are backing Ronaldo on this what are your thoughts on his comments on Rooney.We all should remember we are united fans first and Ronaldo fans secondly.He is the one who put in a transfer request.when he was right all along then why did he get called out by chiealini and bonnuci.He should always remember that it is not about him always.
This guy gets 500k a week.. he can’t handle he isn’t good enough anymore, saddest crybaby in football history!!
Ronaldo speaking the truth.
Respect break between managers n players so every player has to come out with an interview?
Hate ronaldo but love to finish 4th 🤣
Ahd the clip was released on his daughter's birthday.
No body is perfect thats how u defend ronaldo...wish you could had use those words for other united players as well..coz no body is perfect right
This is not about the club. It's all about his gargantuan ego. Get the hell out here man.
For Ronaldo everything is romaldo..even the club is smaller then him... he came out with this interview because the fans are tird of him...trying to again sympathy if he love the clubs he should havent left the club in the first place..so dont bullist with this I LovE the CLUb GOAt this word is useless....one cannot always  be immune bcoz one have done it in the past,,we live in a present so stop talking always about the past
Cr7 ❤️ always
We unfortunately have another six months of this drama from a former great player who legs have gone. Let’s see how many top clubs come looking for him, weren’t many offers last summer and missing chance after chance against Europe League minnows won’t have helped.  Sad end for a once great player who’s powers have diminished.
I've gad enough of his crap
GLAZERS OUT!!!!!!!!!!
Ten Haag is doing well.
Greedy Glazers signed the overpaid old man ! Now the old man has turned against them because he has been benched and substituted !!! Glazers are crap and so is the arrogant diva Ronaldo. Both don’t care about Man United.
I want to see if ronaldo not play well in world Cup and getting sub, what he will do
Player think he is bigger than club --> Problem right here.
Looks like, if you say anything bad about Ronaldo on this channel, you are Glazers in. That is preposterously short sighted and idiotic by Mark Goldbridge. Ronaldo has repeatedly made this about himself this season. Undermining the current manager, is pathetic. Ronaldo's behaviour since the beginning of this season has been rife with examples of CR7 only thinking about himself. He isn't above the club, sadly for Goldbridge, that is only applicable for everyone else but CR7. The club is in shambles, and rather than focusing on the Glazer's out comments made by CR7, the first 20 mins of this video were trying to do PR for CR7. Glazer's running the club into the ground is separate from Ronaldo being a diva. So get your stories straight. This situation is 100% exacerbated and ruined by the Glazers, but Ronaldo going public with this interview is the perfect example of Ronaldo trying to do damage control for his reputation as an ego maniac. It is concerning. And people like Mark Goldbridge are responsible for taking focus away from Glazers out 🔰
Stop comparing him with batman😩😩 just leave
CR7 The legend 🔥🔥🔥
No one doubts Ronaldo’s legacy and his legend status at the club, that won’t change.  No one doubts his comments about how the club is run and poor facilities etc. But it’s quite clear that everywhere he goes it has to be Ronaldo’s way or no way, he needs to make it all about him to comfort his ego, he’s just thrown his manager and team under the bus for the second time in a couple weeks. It’s disgusting, as much as he means to United fans he needs to be released asap.
I support CR7 💯 % ETH disrespected CR7 on many occasions and even Roy Kean talked about it unless your just blind am happy dat he just spoke his minds men and I don't have any problem with it 😉
We told you Mark, ETH only said he wanted to work with CR7 to protect his value for the club in my opinion.
I am also watching the crown…but never thought  tussle in gonna happen between club and ronaldo…
He knows his time is coming to an end. So he gotta protect himself. He knows The team performs good without him. He's not out there playing and The team is winning. So he wants to be the talk of the town, to do so he decided to put out his side of story. This guy is so selfish and greedy. He's flaming Manchester united. He's not helping the club. He is protecting himself..
No Footballer is bigger than a club Unless you are Cristiano Ronaldo
Ronaldo is and will continue to be a legend of the club. Like Mark said its sad that it's come to this. Ronaldo has played his last game obviously. I would have sold him after the world cup wether or not this interview came out. If his daughter was hospitalised and that's why he didn't go on the tour then that's fully justified.
Ronaldo shall not take my World Cup from me!!  Ronaldo: I’m bigger than the World Cup
The only reason he doesn't respect ten hag is because after the club tour he was obviously told that he  wasn't first choice because martial had done ok and Ronaldo couldn't handle that because of last season.
Lvg,jose, Pogba,ander Herrera and now ronaldo, players/managers who are world class said the same thing People here saying sht to ronaldo,but after e years if "ten hag" didn't worked out the fans will be on the ronaldo side....
Ronaldo is right, but why criticize the current manager when your on the team mid season. He must go NOW. There is a time for everything
The glazers are our problem they are the people who running this club to the ground, look at the the owners of Liverpool they know the funds are not there anyone, they know selling the club is the best thing to do, the glazers need to sell the club now!!!
Regardless Mark you don't air your dirty laundry in public there are plenty of people that have been wronged by United but they haven't done this?  I see this as him not getting his wish in the summer & this is his way of ensuring it happens in January. It's gone from United wanting a fee to driving him to the other club themselves. Ronaldo has always had this self-centredness that has made him the great player he has been but my love for Ronaldo will not be clouding my judgement on this for me he's gone too far. He hasn't said anything we don't know about the owners anyway.
Weakbridge - defending him when he slants the club and manager - being glazers out doesn’t mean support this
at least CR7 has the balls to speak out while still a current player.
Glazers Out 🔰
Glazers OUT
Mark himself would be  " get out of my club ...get out. " If it had been any other player than ronaldo
Your very mature I agree with what you said tbh
Ronaldo, “Ten hag is trying to force me out, not only him but senior executives” PM, “So senior executives are trying to force you out?”. Ronaldo, “I should not say that, because I don’t know”.  It appears to be the hurt feelings of a bruised Ego. But I emphasise this is only an opinion on limited information, that is Ronaldo’s own words, that he doesn’t know for a fact that anyone wants him out. But given his behaviour it wouldn’t be a surprise if all involved has had enough of his petulance, for which there is adequate evidence.
The players shouldn’t be mad because what his doing is right the glazers thing was spot on
I'm so confused. Why was uniteds public stance that ronaldo wasn't for sale. Doesn't make sense, the best way to get someone out is to place them in the transfer market
It's nice that he did it after our games shows he cares about the club
Roy Keane was right..
Glazers Out....
I think I now get why he's been poor on the pitch this season because as an employee if he feels betrayed by his employer and psychologically no employee will be able to provide maximum output for that employer. I have no comment on the ten hag statement as there is not enough clarity about it. Fans shouldn't be saying get out of my club cuz they would do the same thing if they were in shoes. Employer employee relationship is a massive thing
Ronaldo just wants out, the timing is perfect
I don’t know who’s right or wrong because everyone can lie.
Mark the disgrace is not the club but Ronaldo. So stop trying to back him up, Ronaldo has messed up! This is not about Ronaldo's love for the club but about his own ego
Respect to this channel 👌❤️🔥
This channel speaks the truth n I'm happy for his bias talking 👌❤️
ETH won’t last…Players will turn on him when Utd’s form goes down…I love that interview…Imagine CR7’s mental health…
Mark Goldbridge has no shame. Can’t even bring himself to criticise this ridiculous move from a player.
United always fails to spot raw talents and buys media hyped players for huge prices-sancho,AWB, Maguire, Pogba,Lukaku examples. Too much obsession with buying English attackers. After sir alex left United made this habit of buying over 30 year old forwards ibra, Ronaldo, Falcao,Cavani. This is not how a club tries to rise back after trophyless seasons
Ronaldo : ten hag and co. Made me miss sitters
But he didnt even mention Glazers even once. Thats what I didnt understand one bit.
Goldberg : whenever ronaldo creates a fucking problem, put the blame on glazers😆😆😆
Ronaldo has basically just called out the Glazers publicly. This interview is exactly what the fans needed in the Glazers out movement..
Again after a great win and important points we are talking about Ronaldo 🤦🏻‍♂️ i am really done with this guy
In my opinion he has nothing to do with Eric ten hag, it's better for him to leave the club as soon as possible. He might be better in the another clubs. He is not the maneger if he plays well in the pitch why should not the maneger let him play . He don't have any thing to blame the maneger.
Him raising his voice against the Glazers, club infrastructure etc is totally warranted. Him raising fingers at the manager is very cynical. He needs to look in the mirror and realize that he is not as good as he was. I adored him as a player too but I cant accept this attitude. Man Utd over any individual ALWAYS  Backing the manager totally.
who cares about ronaldo's bullshit.....right or wrong ,united  is run so badly for 15 years  ......glazers out   the rest is fast food
Ronaldo is just fighting everyone! Ten Hag, the board, Ronney, Neville.. plus he has nothing to bring to the table in the pitch. Nobody feels betrayed except you and Ronaldo Mark. Plus  Mark you keep trying to justify it.
12:15 Mark makes a good point of when the interview was…. If I was CR7 I would’ve stormed off the pitch  like he did that game and been reaching for my phone and telling my agent “Call Piers, it’s happening”🤣🤣
ETH is the man respect the boss ❤
Ronaldo has to understand that he is not 20 something anymore not quick and fast like before,he must give the chances to the younger and skillful talented players.
Bring back Fellaini
Ten hag:- I love RONALDO... In his mind:- (IT'S only for interviews) I will have him to warm MU benches...  Again ten hag:- i respect Ronaldo... In his mind:- I will send him in last to minutes ( that's politics) Ten hag:- it's buisness... ( I m so claver)
GLAZERS OUT!!!!!!
Ronaldo is right on Ralf, people talk so much positive about Ralf but i can't find any material achievements in his coaching carrier.. when he joined man utd, you could see he was clueless on how to win games.
It's about time the people /fans at Manchester United to start protesting against The Glazers
Is he ill? You obviously don’t think so, but that is just speculation. So why don’t you just reserve judgement until you have enough information? Otherwise everything coming out of your mouth is just waffle, and you’re just adding to the confusion you’re talking about.
Sorry Ronnie you bs tictoc talk please in your business and  on play socker
Fergie once said no individual player can be bigger than the club !! One of the reasons he won matches after matches, titles after titles even with bang average players !! Honestly from the bottom of my heart felt so excited and happy when heard that he was returning but now he is behaving like a prima donna and if he wants to leave, let him be because the club will always be bigger than any individual player no matter how big of a superstar you are !!
What has he stated that we don't already know, it's ridiculous coz he is absolutely right, our club is run by complete prats.
All generalisations without evidence. Juventus were glad to be rid of him and Man U were the only club silly enough to pay his wages. He wanted out because he wanted champions league football, but nobody wanted him or/and they didn’t want to pay his wages. There is no evidence so far that the manager disrespected him. The clips I’ve heard are unconvincing, all seems speculation based on feelings. He did get time off for his family circumstances. The club need to make a statement on the facts as they happened, to stop the speculation and to help us to discern fact from fiction.  Oh and stop using your anti Glazer sentiments to support Ronald’s behaviour.
Here comes the truth we are all speaking wrong about the ronaldo look the truth
The messenger has acted like a petulant dickhead. But the message is true and clear.
There's a bigger conversation to be had as bitter a pill this is the man fell on his sword and flipped the glazers as his parting gift
I wonder if u wud have the same energy if pogba came out and said all this
Looks like the coach is covering for the glazers
The fuckin fans should thank the GOAT Cristiano Ronaldo. Cause he loves your fuckin club and you can't even see what's goin on. If he didn't care he would have left last year then. But he stayed and now he is giving you the truth
No matter what goldberg always find a way to defend ronaldo !
Why can't you lot agreee on ten hag point. He said. Ten hag doesn't respect him and i don't respect him back. It's simple.
Ronaldo has played the game.
I'd be surprised if he does not leave in January
The truth interview? Ronaldo's version of the truth. And remember, he can twist it any way which he likes in this Morgan interview. Ten Hag will have a version of 'the truth'. So will everyone else.   But just let it go, United. Move the player on as soon as possible.
Now one was shouting Ralf at man u before he was appointed. Everyone studied him after he was announced. Means he was not known for his coaching before. Ronaldo's comments are on point mate.
Ronnie is destroying his reputation at Man u.....
Goldbridge Golden Quotes:  “I was taught to take in both sides!”  😂😂😂
He should ask himself whether his performance under ETH deserves the respect he demands.
United don’t deserve him
Need to get rid of Ronaldo Trump ASAP
BTW Mark you great, Tank's
Ronaldo is one of my favourite players of all time but it's time to say goodbye he's not liking it here if he doesn't respect Ten hag then he will not perform on the pitch he will always be known as a Man united legend
Ronaldo is ill…mentally 🤒,
The fans suppose to be happy with Ronaldo, he ha  bols to speech all about the wrong doing by the club, come on who did it, nobody or player talks for the good of the club and FANS, nobody sorry about other talks, he knew it, Gleisers out forever
I have two seemingly opposite opinions on this. Ronaldo is a great player but he isn’t the player we need now and he wasn’t the player we needed when we bought him. He’s free to go. Ten Hag is the future. That said, he’s right about club investment and management on the business side. Glazers need to go.
He feels disrespected from being not played
this whole saga has proved the point that you should never ever go back to your ex!
Thank you CR7 for exposing these bums...most of us already knew how bad our club has been run,mb hopefully this wake up the blind sheep
You can choose to jump on him, his history and legacy are sealed, he will leave.. he has nothing to lose. Or else you can see what a shambles this club has become and he was brave enough to come out with it without filters
CR7 is just too old for toplevel. He should step down and go in retirement as a legend. Not as a whiner.
I don't care what he said about Ten Hag.   He is the Truth .
We know the ‘truth’ he’s saying about the club and the people who run it. But you cannot throw shade at your current coach like this. This is just not right. This is not a traffic light, this is just plain wrong. We can always disagree with anybody and on this one I disagree with mark and ronaldo.
Cr7 is the Truth. We needed this.
Trying to avoid Barcelona
cr is a joke. simply put a disgraceful joke
walahi this man only talks fax 👏❤
Very sad. Glazers out!
The manager is a moron he is weighing over his head he has no idea he will fail terribly and all of us fans have to sit there and watch it
You guys are on crack the only winner we’ve had at the club for the last 1015 years is telling the truth this club is a joke. The fact that you guys think that Marcus Rashford is the answer to anything is the reason the club is a joke
Fans wanted the club to be exposed but yet disrespects Ronaldo when he exposes the club? What???
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 such a GOAT move
Thanks Mark! For moderating it well. And not demonizing Ronaldo. And being objective and looking at both sides. Mad respect to you man! UnitedPeoples TV can learn a lot from you.
I find Ronaldo interview as greedy...he didn't say anything about United last season as he was focul point and got goals. Currently situation is completely different so he is protecting himself now saying things about United which we already know
Truth be said
I'm confused...Ronaldo said he wanted it out in the summer. ETH said he is ok with him leaving, but the club didn't want to let him but then they are also actively trying to force him out? But...he wanted out? Hmmm...Am I the only one that is confused on how that makes any sense? Something clearly happened between Ronaldo and ETH in the summer, but ETH picked Ronaldo to appear or start in 10 of 17 Premier League Games and started every Europa League game... He even made him captain against Villa. I think I'm just going to have to box these comments as a bitter fall out and only focus on the Glazers who used Ronaldo to try and quiet protests, sell jerseys, and use him as nothing more than an asset. That's the only part of this interview I care about.
The team new chemistry and mentally is wayyy better without him than with him around…especially now that there’s a big prospect in Garnacho rising.. get him out before he infects him..
Ronaldo should sit down with this guy instead of that leach Pierce Morgan.
It is true ...
Betrayed?! CR7 had no problems joining Man City! Disrespected?! Utd allowed him to miss pre-season due to his personal issues. At his age you can't play every game under a new pressing system without a pre-season.
Imo, there a hand full of problems, but cr7 didn't react properly with a few of those probs
I say f u cr7 to your love for the fans.. fans say F U…
What a shame he said the facilities are the same, no upgrades in equipment. That is very embarrassing. Crazy to think such a big club united is but they are using technology and equipment from 2008.
I think this interview is not too long ago, he is with his new haircut here
We’ve been saying Glazersout but nothing will change. Sad
This has been the most objective analysis of the Ronaldo interview I've heard
Nothing will happen.. Everybody who left the club said these same old things.. Nothing changed nothing will..
All i know is that we seem to be winning without him on the pitch.
Hopefully Ronaldo can join a big club like Qpr to fulfil his ambition , he’s never won the championship just saying
Neeevaaaa go back to your X.
Mark I agree with most of what your saying,but if ETH wanted Ronny then why does he keep playing substandard players ahead of him..he said in August that the truth would come out and this is it..sure Ronny is not blameless but United have been in decline since Sir Alex and they have had some top managers come and gone almost saying what CR7 is saying..CR7 always my greatest player..respect
Glazers OUT!!!
This doesn't help anyone, both parties are to blame... Time to part ways!
Reckon United got wind of it when Ten Hag made that strange respect comment when he didn't bring him on at city and United got him to postpone it untill after the season broke up for the world cup through some arrangement with someone (hopefully) lined up to replace him, seen piers hint that he had something a few times on twitter 🤓
Now that it’s clear he’s gone... Do we sign a world class #9? Like Joao?! Or trust martial and rashford, and go after a younger talent to push garnacho like maybe Gakpo?
Ronaldo is absolutely right!
The way tenhag has handled ronaldo is disgraceful. He is club legend. One of the greatest of all time, we never setup a system so we could have utilised his finishing skills and headers.
You go on like Ronaldo wasn't given a chance this season well he has but Ronaldo's been awful every time he's been given a chance, stop making excuses for him he's nothing but a petulant child, legend or not absolutely no excuse for his behaviour this year.
It's exposes the Glazers but why drag Ten Hag and Rooney 💪
CR37 ACTING LIKE CR17
Such a childish interview. Agree with every bit Rooney said about Ronaldo. I think Ronaldo’s real frustration comes from the fact that he offered himself to every club in Europe over the summer but no one showed any interest in signing him. He thinks he is bigger than Man United . ETH should freeze him out for the rest of the season. Let him train with the under 18s
Ronaldo has done us one last favour by doing this, the club is now left with no other option than to be busy in the coming transfer window's.
Good riddance.
Man City ♥️
We all fans know the incompetence of the club and we don't need someone who is paid half a million per week to reiterate it, his true intentions were never the betterment of the club but always about him.
I get it but he’s still at man united , the interview should have taken place after he left
My “amber” take on this whole thing is that good on Ronaldo (I guess) for taking on the Glazers and decay of the club. No other player has the platform to do this… and clearly Ronaldo is on the way out, so I’m glad he brought those points to light. That being said, he comes off as an absolute bitter prat with his comments on ETH, Rangnick, and the club’s treatment of him. Completely disrespectful and I genuinely can’t wait for him to get out of the club—you can’t do that as a player. I just want the club to move on, he was a great player but clearly it’s time for him to leave.
Let’s see what is going to offer 🇵🇹 at the World Cup
Ronaldo is the brave one, he doesn't need to be perfect in it all. Ten Hag and the rest of the players are to leave the club before Ronaldo.  It's a shame how in all levels of society a few people has to take the fall, lose their jobs etc. for speaking against whats wrong while the rest rides it out from the sideline saving their bacon.
"The minute a Manchester United player thought he was bigger than the manager, he had to go" - Sir Alex Ferguson
Selfish CR8
I think there needs to be a separation between what Cristiano Ronald did and has continually done, which is catering to himself with little regard for whatever consequences to others, and how the club is run. What Ronaldo has done and giving the interview to Piers Morgan of all people is simply appalling. If there  is any betrayal then it is from Ronaldo and no one else.
I believe Ronaldo. I am with him.
everytime the team wins and does something good, this sick old man wanna make it about himself
Glazers are man United Ferguson found out, mourinho found out, LVG found out, Pogba found out, millions of man United fans found out and now Ronaldo must find out 😂
NOBODY is bigger than Manchester United.  Not the owners, the board, the executives, the coaches and even the washed up prima donna players.    We just got Ronaldo's side and we won't get any honest answers in reply from the club  GLAZERs OUT!!!!
Well, finally someone can talk like this unlike ex united players and this is a good thing coz the Glazers might wanna sell this time but Cr7 also disrespect to our Manager n Manutd imo.
Bruh literally handed out a transfer request in the summer. How has anyone forced him out?
25:34 Loved that star wars reference 🙂
In this, let's all remember that Piers Morgan is complete tras.
We don't need a legendary top scorer that led the team from 2nd in the PL to 6th, but also caused majory chaos of the team and had two good managers fired. You want to know why Ten Hag lost repect to your legendary top scorer, simple, because your legendary top scorer refused to the club's preseason training and forced the club to sell him without any UCL club would like to buy him. Your legendary top scorer has earned all the disrepect by himself! SUPER CLEAR! Don't mix Glazers with your legendary top scorer. EVERYONE knows the club didn't move forward from 10 yrs ago. Glazers still out, but please, Ronaldo, your legendary top scorer, first.
Glazers must stay Ronaldo out no one is bigger than them. They own the club.
i just want to see how much United's stock falls on monday lol
Cristiano brings up some good points.  A lot of truth.  His viewpoint on things will definitely be an exclamation point on his United career.  He is definitely going out with a bang...
How has ETH betrayed Ronaldo when ETH has given CR7 numerous chances on the field and he hasn’t delivered. I do think ETH chooses who plays based on merit and not on reputation. And it corroborates with the results where the team plays better without Ronaldo on the field. So did Ronaldo expect ETH to start him everytime based on CR7’s reputation? I don’t understand and I would like ETH’s honest words on what happened.  On the flipside. Ronaldo is right to say how he feels about executives and how the club is being run poorly. It has been a pattern in the last decade about the club’s incompetence. Ronaldo’s words are powerful and hopefully will pressure the Glazers to be accountable.
Thank you Glazers
Yeah Mark, funny how you didn’t have the thought of the “traffic light system” or “this is life” approach with Ole. Ronaldo is wrong in this situation and needs to leave for the good of the club.
I know the club isn’t the best run club in the world, but Ronaldo has nowhere to hide and no one to blame but himself. He missed preseason, his form has been abysmal, his attitude on the pitch has been worrisome, and his off field antics are on par with Pogba’s. He is a shadow of his former self and It’s no wonder ETH doesn’t play him. May be ETH lost all the respect he had for ronaldo because of his antics this season. Overall, I think it’s a good thing that ronaldo will now leave.
GET OUT OF THE CLUB GLAZERS!!!!
Club is shitty since Sir Alex Left it's a fact. And ppl like Zlatan, Mourinho, Sanchez, di María, and now Ronaldo  have said it all
Whole thing reeks of ego/ arrogance, bravado and bullshit. Critics with a point, including Rooney = jealous. Rangnick = “haven’t heard of him, how can he be boss”. How it is Keane said he had offers and the club kept him, when Ronaldo “frames it” that he was being forced out? What; forced out and disrespected yet he insisted on staying in that mess? 😂 oh I bet! Absolute illogical bullshit. Ego won’t let him admit he wasn’t wanted elsewhere; at a club of stature he feels he deserves.
Remember when Ronaldo said I’ve done an interview and I’m gonna reveal the truth. Just check his haircut.
I blame Pogba
Some of what Ronaldo said already being said by Mourinho and x players about how the club is managed
Its obvious that ETH dosen't respect Ronaldo because Ronaldo to big a shadow. Ole was the same.
my childhood idol, hate the way it ended but will always love him
Ronaldo wanted his way out but united kept him , He didnt deserved to play europa . Since he left united he has became bigger united
The thing is in pre season ten hag said it ronaldo wasn't in tour because of family matter and escaped answering other on it so even ten hag said it it was about family so it might be the upstairs that have done this and ronaldo said there's a interview coming in early and maybe was only gonna expose club but what happend during season him dropping cr7 and stuff ronaldo might have put 2 3 quotes after on ten hag ti win tha5 battle as well
Ronaldo is a joke.
So finally we will be getting a striker in Jan ❤️
No way Ten Hag is leaving !
Have you guys considered that whenever clubs change ownership that often goes with their management? When Glazers go it's highly likely ETH will also have to go elsewhere. New ownership will come with their ambition and what their ideal manager is. Closest case in point - Chelsea.
United is a failing stagnant club. Ten hag a company man for glazers
United is a fake club liars can't polish a turd 😂
Come to JDT Ronaldo...
Hes being honest
Sorry but if he didn’t know United were sh*te when he joined then he didn’t bother to watch them for the last 10 years! It’s like knowingly joining a failing company and then complaining it’s a failing company!! I always love him for some great moments but enough is enough now. Out. Club is bigger than one player. Always will be.
Why is disagreeing with mark = with the glazers now wtf
They got lucky today. Fulham should of won
Beta ten hag
I see all of them hating Ronaldo for speaking the truth keep hating
Lets stop talking about the relationship with the manager that is the least let's talk about the Glazer's who are the biggest problem and continue that traction. Dont let the media keep the traction about Ronaldo talking about the coach it matters the least. The guy is a serial winner and winners hate losing and what he says about the running of the club is what should get the headlines. The GLAZERS are the problem and should remain top of the priority list. Remember our focus should always be on the club and its running, that should always be our top priority.
Backing Ten Hag fully
Note it down...man u will never ever will the league and champions league..,....karma hits u very hardly...once a legend always legend cr7
MU = Kardashians of PL, rich but trashy
Piers Morgan and the Sun - the same people who were a the heart of phone hacking scandals - disgraceful choice says it all.
GLAZERS OUT
GLAZERS OUT!!!!!!
I hope Ronaldo’s words will finally get the Glazers out of this club.
What does wage have to do with how happy a player should be. If anyone has issues at their job a high wage doesn't eliminate those problems especially when you can get a similar wage elsewhere
He used to be great but his play has just gone down hill. That’s why he has been on the bench. I think he was right to take care of his family that comes before everything.
I stand ETH. CR7 is still legend. And GLAZERS OUT!
Disappointed with the Ten Hag comments but love his comments exposing the club and how it’s being run.
Only Ronaldo was man enough to expose the truth that there are a few vultures running manchester that want him out because it's obvious he is getting paid too much and not doing enough to make the club a winning club.
# Save the glaciers
15:03 A glimpse into Goldbridge's secretive past
To anyone hoping the Ronaldo  interview eventually forces the glazers family out, don’t get your hopes up. And don’t assume that things will get magically fixed in a post glazer era. How can we be sure the successors to the glazer family won’t do a worse job than they have? Ralf Ragnick himself said this club needs open heart surgery. This clubs needs every medical surgery known to man to fix this club.
The way I see it theres only one solution and that is to bring Ole back
Madrid - "I feel disrespected" Juventus - "I feel let down" United - "I feel betrayed" 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 United may have poor owners and may be run badly for a decade, but only the self obsessed, sulky man child that is Ronaldo, would stoop to a low blow interview like this. The world knew of Ronaldo's character way back since the infamous Portugal "wink". He cares only for himself, his own career, his own legend. This interview is not Ronaldo calling out the club to blow the lid off, it's  designed only to protect himself whilst trying to very strategically keep some fans onside. Why people can't see this. Your swept away on your Ronaldo bias train. I've loved Ronaldo for years and his career and stats say it all, but this interview is bang out of order and a total self serving and self protecting act.
The interview was done during the weekend. When he was supposed to sick.  He responded to Rooney's comments which was live on talksport a few hours earlier  In any other business that's gross misconduct
Yeah right so you’re saying ten hag doesn’t seem like a person who lies and at the same pt you say you don’t know him.. In the man city game he said he didn’t bring cr7 on out of respect and in the spurs game he wants him to come and play for 1-2 mins when the team’s winning. Like wtf are you on mate? Ten hag might be the best coach for utd but the way he handled cr7 is poor from his side and the thing about coming and saying cr7 is in his plans coz utd doesn’t have strikers … if cr7 left then utd might have played maguire as cf for the whole match XD
Ronaldo: united cant reach levels of city and liverpool/arsenal (play good football) with this management.  Then goes on to blame ten hag...who dropped ronaldo because united were better playing without him. What a two faced diva.
How can we moving forward with moyes? Old lvg, mous problem.. when the others.. signing manager that on current top performance
You're a joke siding with him. You're not United Goldbridge.
Only channel with some sane opinion on this situation. Respect. No taking sides. Call the right and wrong on both sides.  GLAZERS OUT.
Ronaldo wanted to leave yet is crying that the club want to force him out? Eh?!
Its all Pogba's fault. Just ask Graeme Souness.
on fergies deathbed he will regret not calling out the glazers and trying to get them out. Fergies the only person the could ever make it happen
People are not getting it. Why are you asking him to leave? Are you seriously thinking he is going to continue with Man Utd. I was 100% sure he will leave after World Cup, Now I'm 1000% sure.
fair play Ronaldo about time someone needs to speak out , Man U used him as a Marketing Tool, Den Hag aint got a clue
I love it , the fans too have changed as well . Look at this muppet talking on the YouTube channel
Ronaldo will always be respected and his comments may be the end of his career with MUFC but it all needed to be said. People should hear what he is saying. Unfortunately his freedom of speech will affect his contract and he is entitled to his opinions and glad he has shared with us all what he thinks so we can see things through his eyes. Lots of love for you Ronaldo and good luck to you in your future
The interview is a few months old. He talked about about that he was going to talk to Piers Morgan a few months ago, It was news back then. I'm sure someone remembers. It cant just be me. I'm not sure what it was about. but the interview is certainly months old otherwise they have planned for it for several months which means he has felt like this for months.
How is he being forced out when he tried to leave in the summer? He didn't want to stay
Next, i want ten hag to drop his script and speak the reality ffs do it ETH...
Idc I want him out we play better without him he would be better playing somewhere els
I believe in the big games against the big boys your going to need Ronaldo those young guys currently have no experience in big games where trophy is on the line
Petulant child don't let the door hit you on the Way out.
Ronaldo only chatting cause he’s been on the bench 😂😂 stop tryna make him a martyr, he’s a fricken mercenary.
What frustrate him was the world Cup is coming and he did not play so much and this is his last world Cup so he will definitely frustrated
Ronaldo has done it for UTD . Ten Haag has done nothing yet . Yes Ronaldo is  a UTD legend
Will Ronaldo still get Half a mill a week after this? Just wondering 🤔
Just to point out the hypocrisy of Goldbridge and his fangirls.  1. Lingard discloses discreetly that things aren't right at Utd and there's separation in the dressing room.....he's a traitor.  2. Ronaldo does a full blown interview basically confirming what we knew...a legend.   Yeah consistent...
I am portuguese and i know the history about Ronaldo and understand his mentally, since many years hes been told by everybody he his the best on the world, hes ego just got too big, also he was never humble, he become like a spoiled brat and offcorse now he started to get frustrated because hes no more the best on the world, hes no more untouchable, so instead of taking reponsability for hes lately very poor performances, he choose to blame the club organization, blame the coach because someone with his ego cant accept that his finished has a top player and that he cant compete at the highest level anymore, also on the beginning of season he tried to get another club to play champions league but nobody wanted him, so frustration and rejection and also other personal problems just got the best on him.
Air is invisible... GLAZERS out 💀
Ronaldo giving answers to fans who will never know - why the club aren’t winning anymore. I think the fans should thank him for that.
I still don't get the fuss about Ronaldo as a player, just like man united,  Ronaldo is living off of his past glory.  His performance level as a striker is poor and that's what he is being paid for. So if he is not giving performance worth of his pay, it's only right for the club to let him go
Respect him as a legend of the club but Ronaldo is just so selfish. He should go.
its funny how people forget without him in last season man u would not have been in europa league
Ten Hag's hands are tied now. He has to get Ronaldo out of the club, or lose the players forever. Ronaldo is a United legend, and it is an incredibly sad day. But after this, his continuing at United is untenable.
Well said, Mark. Respect Ronaldo. Like and subscribe
He should've never come back. United are trash.
Those who are criticizing Cristiano ronaldo will be the same people who will say sack Erik ten hag just wait for some years
Not everything is posted in the media, private talks etc can let him feel disrespected
Garnacho is very lucky he got an assist off Ronaldo on his last game
How can you defend Ronaldo after this, he has missed sitters, left mid matches and now says ETH did not respect him. He gave you the captains armband FFS. Grow a spine
Ronaldo claims, that he wants to help ..? Really.
If he’s gonna do this, I hope he don’t hold back. If he is gonna open the floodgates hope he fully opens it
500k a week...my heart bleeds...
15:00 ""I was taught to take in both sides......"
Mark you picking out what you want to and you interpreted how you want to
just more off pitch noise is anything he said a surprise he doesn't like manager who won't play him human reaction, glazers suck team poorly run wow slow sports news !!!!!
This should be the end of the Glazer's its impossible for them not to sell up yes ronaldo broke his contract but if the interview finally gets rid of the Glazer's so be it if your going do it like this expose the owner's so what the new manager takes a bit of a hit so what long as it shows the Glazer's are the crap owner's they are so be it.
Who’s the goat now goldbridge this sissy? Or Leo?
He probably criticizes ten hag because managers can easily make you feel like a God or like you aren't worth a piece of candy. If his daughter is in the hospital and he comes back to bad treatment you can't blame him for not liking ten hag. I always knew ten hag was probably lying about wanting ronaldo to keep his image with united fans good
Shat on Man United
Don't forget that he also feels disrespected by madrid and juve when he left, disrespect & betrayal is always his way out. what i don't understand is the need of this interview, this is purely my opinion, but i think ronaldo did this not for the sake of the club or fans but himself. he may felt that he reaching the end of his career and want to play more regular,  of course in champions league. by doing this interview, then the club will be forced to terminate his contract and he can leave.
Man had to literally see Jordan Peterson to talk stuff out. Just imagine his mental state.
All the dumb CR7 hating fans will keep bashing him and sticking up for. this pathetic club. I hope Ronaldo and his new club end up facing off against United at some point and Ronaldo scores a hat trick.  What a disgrace this club became after 2013. What is worse is what the fans became. Ungrateful jerks.
Mark don't you get it that there was no relationship between Ronaldon n ETH? Ten Hag wasn't lying. He only said what the media needed to hear for news sake. I knew from the very beginning that ETH was going to have issues managing Ronaldo. He's ego is beyond him, and ETH knew that. As a result he was willing to let him leave but the board. Forget what he said t the media how many times.
GLAZERS OUT🔰🔰🔰
Why is most people blaming ronaldo none of u say about the bit about his daughter she was a twin the other twin died like mark said I don't blame him for not going on preseason u wouldn't and I'm sure u wouldn't to .that is disgusting from the club to question him on this
thats y we have gone through so many managrs rotten from the top down
Mark. Seriously.   Ronaldo is done.  Stop defending him
Ronaldo time is up he was the past he should have never been allowed to come back and Glazer need to go as well
15:02  he absolutely does
I pray this does not affect Garnacho because Ronaldo is his hero ! In a way it was a young Ronaldo out there today might have been bitter sweet for Ronaldo today,  reminding him of the start of his amazing journey  !
Its clear we need to reserve judgement until the full interview but, it has been clear since the pre season tour something had gone wrong.
I loved that he said this. Still nothing will change 😭
People who think Ronaldo loves the club are foolish.  Christiano  can’t stand the fact the team plays better without him and he knows it Mark is a constant Ronaldo apologist fact he  should open a new channel United Stand Ronaldo FC
All on the Glazers. He should have been allowed to leave in the summer but the owners wanted to keep him and this is the consequence.
Mark Goldbridge can be funny even when he doesn't want to be 15:00  lol 😆 😂 🤣
Perhaps it is better for Eric ten Hag to go back to Ajax, where they have more respect for him as a manager, we will welcome him with open arms.
Ten Hagg has a lot of explaining to do but I still support him
Focus on what is on fire now, it's Garnacho and for me, United above everyone. Just think about this, 500k/week and he felt betrayed?? The world is going crazy
He needs to go.
All Mark does is whinge at people who aren’t glazer out. Ronaldo is a disgrace
I respect Goldbrige, I don’t know if I agree with everything he says, but I can appreciate his thought process. How he don’t just take something out of context and always being a realist and don’t jump to conclusions without the facts.
If this was any other player at United nobody would even try and defend him. People are blinded from his behaviour because they are besotted with him.
I am not sad. I am relieved that finally someone grows a pair and calls out the f***ing a-holes running this club to the ground. Thank you CR7 you are a legend and a martyr now.  Viva Ronaldo
Glazers out!
The respect was lost when ETH and the club complained when his daughter was ill......
Glazers nad Ronaldo out
From the bits i‘ve heard there‘s a lot of truth. United hasn‘t evolved, the owners have fucked up the club, old infrastructure, no ambition
Mark is a even bigger manchild than Ronaldo.  Ronaldo was the main reason for Uniteds worst ever PL season last year, anyone that doenst see that knows nothing about football
Suiiiiiii
all I'm hearing is Cristiano Ronaldo makes up a lot of excuses for the fact he can't do it any more. Ronaldo is the past and should have been left there. I will back the manager all day on this because what he is trying to build is the future. Enjoy your last World Cup then find another club please Ronaldo.
Oh he is pissed off because theres no drive to be competitive and yet when he is underperforming manager puts him on the bench instead of being competitive and improving he throws tantrums and refuses to come on as a sub. So much sense yes.
Ronaldo blatantly disrespected the manager last year, the club, fans and team mates both last year and this season.  If it was any other player Goldbridge would be going on them. It’s total hypocrisy
Now imagine if Harry Maguire comes out and speaks against ETH.. boy it will be fum
At the end of the day the conclusion of every article will prove how badly the club was run through out all these years. The facilities from the gym all the way to the kitchen was stuck with Alex era left me speechless
IMO Ronaldo has tarnished his legacy now. No one is bigger than the club. I honestly believe rangnick over ronaldo.
Mark you are an idiot for kissing Ronaldo  butt. I cannot stand d the bias by Mark come on man. Ronaldo doesn't belong @ United.
Even tho the manager view is not what we want to hear 1 man's respect for another has nothing to do with us it just isn't.  If they don't respect eachother then it is what it is
The spin machine will be in overdrive this week.
So the player can’t be bigger than the club but the manager can as long as he wins tho
Ronaldo is trying to fix man u. Jus watch
It’s you that’s fine.  Rubbish
I cannot blame him for being disrespected. It’s time to expose what is going on in the front office.  A lot of upper executives are going to be nervous this week.
EtH is Dutch, and they always very direct and honest. EtH was glad to have such a great footballer as Ronaldo in his team, and he didn't want him out. But Eth has to do what is the best for MU, and the squad was playing better without Ronaldo, because the strategy from ETH is fast playing football, and Ronaldo was not fast enough, we all have see that when he was playing this season. It could be no form, or still depressed about loosing his child, or he is at the end of his career on the age of 38. We dont know, even EtH dont know. Eth made him captain in the last game. In this point Ronaldo was not respectful to EtH and the players.
Bro will defend Ronaldo over anything but will berate other players and call them a disgrace based on rumours
United stuck in 2009
Mr proffesional at it again
Ronaldo's absence at pre-season is fine. He is entitled to do anything if he feels unhappy and wants a break or there is something. No player would willingly miss football, we love it, let alone one of the best to touch a football.  Whatever Ronaldo is saying now he did it for the best of the club. He saw things that aren't at a good standard, so he is doing what he can to help the club. If he didn't care about the club he would have gone to city and not listened to anyone otherwise.  I respect Ronaldo for talking and saying what he feels and what is going on, because the club is like a secret society, not willing to talk to anyone and they run things as if they are bigger than anyone else. Ten hag I respect him as a coach and what he did in terms of team selection is justified for the good of the team. But he should have given or give Ronaldo the chance to live out his career the best he can. Do what is best for Ronaldo, play him and get top 4 or sell him in january to a champions league club. Wish you the best Ronaldo
The thing is Ronaldo is a spoilt brat.He wouldn't say this if he was playing every game🤣he's got no respect for the club and his team mates.He has always been self Centred right from the go.Ronaldo is someone who likes the spotlight to be on him and when,so what you are seeing  now is someone who's sulking and whinging because he's not on the spotlight anymore🤣he should grow up.If he likes United he wouldn't be on 500k p/w.He thinks he is bigger than the club
They were looking forward to work with each other, but the respect and trust between Ronaldo and Ten Hag were probably crackled when Ten Hag announced no captaincy change which makes Ronaldo think he’s just another Rangnick. Then Ronaldo try to find new club while not joining preseason tour is disrespectful in Ten Hag’s perspective. However the final breaking point must be cause by Ronaldo’s performance not meeting either himself or Ten Hag standard, which put this situation into downfall loop.
Hopefully the clubs stocks hit the floor and glazers are forced to sell
The moment your opinion is not the same as he's you support the owners
ronaldo crying no change their then lol  😂
Mark how about your not listening!!!!!!!!!
Where can you see the full interview?
What a toxic piece of crap. Hopefully this is the end of Ronaldo at this great club.
Like how mark isn't one sided on the story.
As much as I love the GOAT, there is an undertone of smug in this interview. Ronaldo for all his actual reasons for not attending pre-season, shows up with his agent on first day back. Why? I would like the answer to that. Why has he not said anything about handing in a transfer request? You won't be too far off if you assumed the club won't let him go and he has conjured up a way to get his contract terminated by doing this interview.
Move him on and out wake up, he's yesterday's news
He was told he would be on the bench against Fulham and his answer was he is ill
All we need now is Ronaldo wearing a gold and green scarf 🔥🔥
It's a sad day.. Cristiano will always be a legend. So ashamed at how my club has treated him. Glazers OUT!!!
Hope he has great World Cup with Portugal 🇵🇹
Also guys one glaring fact - during pre season eth was asked if ronaldo has spoken to him…. He said no …. So ronaldo never bothers to call his new manager even once ….. so we know how much respect ronaldo had for eth from the start
It's time to celebrate the Man Utd win however CR7 interview break the moment.
I also would not respect a dutch fraud.
I can confirm that yes I am an idiot
the platform is there for others to come out and speak out of the crap has been happening at that club lets see if anyone has got the balls or they will hide  no one has called out the club on this scale since the glazers have took over they have been beating around the bush
GLAZERS OUT!!!!..... CR7 OUT!!!!  Ten Hag and new Man United IN!!!!!  Laters
Glazers out
The Ronaldo Stand!
Our club should have given Ronaldo time with his child who was hosptalized....
Looking at the corner of the dressing room and seeing Maguire put a captains armband on must make him ill ! Maguire has to go !
Ronaldo is a waning player who is fighting for attention…..time to move on
seeing our legend leaves like this is heartbreaking  just hope the interview can turn our club around to make some good out of it
Ronaldo Stand
The comments on ragnick and ten hag have me furious. The comments on the glazers is something i wanted a player to do for ages. Imagine he had just focused on them. Wouldve been brilliant. Instead im disappointed
I'm mixed here, In one hand I do love his open approach and he's a united legend to me and always will be, He's Speaking Facts obviously the clubs a mess and he's been scapegoated many times but let's not be blinded by the other hand he wanted to leave in the summer, he almost joined City prior, he wanted to be the number one again at 37 and let's realise how distasteful this interview is,  He seems extremely bitter and angry and pierce laps that up better than anyone and that can produce a lot of hateful quotes like the Rooney one etc.  Obviously ronaldo is leaving but to leave like this I'd argue shows the club and fans a lot of disrespect too and nobody is bigger than the club fergie said that.  I think Ronaldo just comes off very badly here and does us no favours. He could very easily have Gone to the world Cup tried his best and left the club in January and then explained all in an interview after, so why not do that, because ronaldo unfortunately is a pr driven self centered machine these days and his drop from the top isn't sitting well with him mentally unfortunately. If you don't play to suit him then he's not happy with it. God help the next club he joins and that's a shame ending to his utd career. Shame all round really glazers out.
Ten hag hasn’t done anything close to what Ronaldo achieved in his career
I have always had this inkling that ETH  had issues handling senior established superstar players   Here it is exposed. Remember when all his former team mates at Real Madrid and Juventus came out to call for Respect for Ronaldo. I this this was it. They are backing him here. Glazers out.  I can’t wait for the rest of the interview! Thank you CR7. You still are the GOAT for me. We love MU and cannot bear to allow this circus to carry on.
Now relation between ten hag and Ronaldo irreparable. Sack ten hag and hire Pochettino
I can’t be the only one who thinks that Ronaldo is an absolute joke for saying MOST of these things. He talks about respecting the fans yet refused to play in front of them. There is no player bigger than the club. Even Sir Alex wouldn’t take this level of nonsense from Ronaldo. And before you all start, SAF got rid of plenty of great united legends when the time was right.
I’m so glad I saw ronaldos last game at old Trafford ❤️ He’s the goat
Didn’t expect anything else from Mark. Guess the Ronaldo show is over… No sympathy from me…
Even if most of what he said is fair, if he doesn't respect the manager, he has to go. It is that simple
I support United but Ronaldo deserves to be treated with respect by our club. However, Ten Hag can choose  not to pick Ronaldo in his team selection. And no players is bigger  than United.. And Ronnie is  and will always  be a United Legend... I blame our club, Owners, Board  for creating the Ronaldo mess..
tbh ronaldo jus said what he had to say
Come Chelsea Ronaldo
Ronaldo loves the club and the fans ! Simple as that.. he came here to win trophies and what he saw inside the club shocked to him to his very core.. I am glad that he has come out and exposed everyone !!
I wish he hadn't done this interview
If he doesn't like Ten Hag he should leave asap. And it would be wiser to leave first and speak whatever he want to expose about the club and owners. But not when under an active contract. That is massive disrespect to his teammates and the ones that idolize him.
There is absolutely no coming back now it’s over sadly 😐
His contract till June 2023 he’s staying for now
LVG said it, Herrera said it, Mourinho has said how badly the Club is run. Now Ronaldo is saying it, there is a pattern here. On top of that ragnick said the team needs open heart surgery. Glazers out.
29:00 Just a reminder that Mourinho wanted Maguire as well.
The real truth is that the glazers are a bunch of bankers with a W
As Picasso said, you have to destroy it to rebuild it and if they start with me, for me, it’s not a problem. “ GLAZERS OUT 🧩🧩
I THINK RONALDO IS GOING TO PSG..WATCH THIS SPACE.
Ronaldo we will always love ! But a parting of the way is nessasary !
Ronaldo the hero
Ronnie you are a United Legend.. You deserve to go back to to a winning footballing team where you can   win Cups, Trophies,Leagues Cups and Champion Leagues, and many ballon d'ors...
I think this will take a twist - with Ten Hag getting fired. Casemiro, Varane & Bruno will side with Ronaldo not Ten Hag. Ten Hag has lost the lockeroom.
There are always two sides to a story.... but I hope Ten Hag doesn't join words....
Why not, Erik might be the coach but Ronaldo is a player legend and have given his heart and soul for the club which Ten Hag has just arrived and might not win anything
i like you mark , but im sorry how are you still trying to find ways to be on his side?
Missing game with illness, last time we saw him, he was giving a taste of his own medication to T. Mings 😂
Blame the Glazier..simple as that..
Ronaldo's attitude is disgraceful. Get out of our club.
The same people complain about the board in the summer and now Cristiano is stating his piece about them and the fans are criticizing him for it. Very hypocritical imo
now waiting for ralf ragnick........
Our board needed to invest in our football team. We need more investment into our team. Glaziers  , and Board out at United...
It is finally over for ronaldo . Sad it ended this way. Hope he can finish his career happy .
I dont understand his comments on rangnik. He would have been great if manchester trusted him as sporting director. Laimer would probably be at the club if he had a transferwindow. I get that he might not be the couch with the reputation for manchester united but he built teams all over germany in the years. Just a lire from Ronaldo to say he didnt know him at all. But i think its nice to see a player just saying his opinion and being ruthless.
It wouldn’t surprise me if Ten Hag said something like “I understand it’s awful about your daughter, but we really need you on this tour.” And Ronaldo has seen that as disrespectful. And the relationship never recovered from there.   Publicly, Ten Hag said he’s excited to work with Ronaldo, but also that he hadn’t spoken to him.   At the time that didn’t add up. You would speak to your star player if he hasn’t come on the tour, if nothing else just to see if he’s ok, and see if there is a chance he could join.   Ten Hag isn’t as honest as Rangnick was with the media. He protects the club - not necessarily for the glazers’ benefit, for his own benefit and the harmony of the dressing room.
United Fans: Glazers Out!!  Ronnie: Glazers Out!!! United Fans: How dare you?
Embarrasing fans who are backing Ronaldo, you're ronaldo fans not Man Utd. Hopefully you leave with him
Love you even more ❤️❤️❤️ Thank you goat you are greatest ❣️❣️❣️
I like Ten Hag but I don't like how  he has been treated by Ten Hag our Board and  our owners...
He is forcing his way out the club. The timing is so bad. Bad bad timing
Well, the truth is Ronaldo is an egomaniac who wants personal glory more than anything else while United is a badly ran club which can't bring other pieces together to get the best out of a player with such ego so this creates an obvious toxic enviorment. To put it simply United can't give Ronaldo instant success and Ronaldo's ambitions won't make him wait for United to get their s..t together (which they probably won't anytime soon).
Ronaldo did the right thing. He exposed the owner's and the stupidity they had around the club.
Clearly ETH doesn’t know how to coach a big player, eth out
Ten hag is not a saint hes been sabotaging games when cristiano plays . They lose on purpose when he plays just to justify not playing him
Who cares ? Leave our club. Your not bigger than ETH. You think your still that young CR7. Our team is better without you and we don’t have time for experiments. Selfish dude always putting himself ahead of team work.
Talking about throwing the cat amongst the pigeons, I'd have to laugh if Ronaldo had enough billions to buy out the Glazers.
Ronaldo may as well retire, when he leaves Man Utd what club is going to take him, and I'm not putting all the blame on him. It's just that no other club will want all this baggage.
Wow man the dirts coming out on manu 😂😂😂
The Real Housewives of Manchester
Mark dickride ronaldo so much, just bais as all these British journalists.
I hope he knows that the fans on this time wont be by his side this time.
This is the worst of Ronaldo, an arrogant and whiny brat who’s toxic to the club. It doesn’t matter how good of a player you are, you must respect the coach and the shirt you’re playing for.
Ronaldo has always been a winner, a powerful winning mentality. The others around him can’t handle this and can’t keep up with him. That’s the problem!!! Unfortunately United will never be United until the rot is removed!!!
Ronaldo trying to go after Rooney’s career and looks (he is not even a bad looking man at all) is a complete disgrace. Unprofessional and a prat, cannot even handle criticism from an ex team mate. Really really poor and needs to instill better values into people who look up to him
We will not see Ronaldo again ☹️
People wanted him out last season he only joined last season
Noone is bigger than the club, period! CR is a great player but he is a player,not the coach and for him to do an interview  like that is disrespectful to the club and the players. Sad to leave your legacy from Man U. Spoiled and entitled you are and its time to move on.
When he said the facilities haven’t improved in years since he was here that says tons.Glazers haven’t improved the club facilities stadium and certainly not performance.Good for Ronaldo his opinion speaks volumes.
Someone once said its not about how the message is being said,  the point is did you get the message?
No mark this is problem here you can’t back him now this club under ten hag is improving we have a strong manager now that makes bid decisions. We are a far better team without him. His ego is so big it unreal. Young garnacho scores the winner today and Ronaldo takes that away for him. It’s time for him to go don’t let the door hit you on the way out
Biggest man-child ever.
Susprised you play better with ronaldo? Because he has never gotten the encouragement and support he needed. Ronaldo constantly blasted on social media even before the things he did
He has been playing ever since he returned what has he done to change the team?
Goldbridge, your love in for Ronaldo is embarrassing   We are playing better without him this season.   Last season wasn't his fault but this season we have been better when he hasn't played. It is not complicated at all
He just can’t accept the fact that he doesn’t start and nor should he obviously sorry for his daughter being in hospital but in my opinion it boils down to he’s selfish and can’t accept reality he shouldn’t start for Utd and maybe even Portugal he just need to accept reality he’s on the down still he is top 5 goat
Read between the lines of what he's saying, the Glazers are not investing what they should be into man united. They're bleeding the club dry and won't stop until it's an empty shell. GLAZERS OUT.
Viva Ronaldo ❣️he‘s right
Suiii 4 life
Honestly Ronaldo has been poor  Erik Ten  Hag loved him and trusted him
I hope this doesn’t influence Casemiro or varane in any way
Pray this interview finally forces the Glazers out!! Good on Ronaldo dont agree with the ETH thing like everyone else but the rest is brilliant lets see what the rest of the interview is now
It is so sad and unfortunate how all of this went down in the end. Ronaldo vs Lewandowski in February would have been truly amazing but oh well ..
Spat his dummy out AGAIN. The Goat 🐐  spoiling it for himself with BS like this and throwing his arms about and walking down the tunnel.   I'm afraid he's tarnished his legacy at United now.  What a shame 😔
Ronaldo also ruined Solskjaer's team, he also wanted Den Haag's, but it seems that it won't work, and now he's angry... everyone betrayed him, and he wanted to join City, but Guardiola is a little smarter...
Are we now going to have Maguire coming out with an interview mentioning ETH unfair treatment as to why his on the bench... imagine that.
Ah,  keep stuttering over your grey area of life crap, Ronoldo was a totally all about me, not about the club jerk. How does ETH go forward with a cancer in his locker room.
I would say i watch more football than most and follow most leagues and i had never heard about Ralp before he came to United.
There is no angle to this. Ronaldo OUT!
I mean if Ronaldo really does care so much about about the Club he wouldn't give ETH such a hard time would he...?
He is actually more sore about his own interest and how he is treated rather than the condition of the club.
He wanted out before playing for Ten Hag. What are you supposed to do with a player who wanted to leave?
Is the hoodie marks wearing available to buy?
I did not watch the interview but did he in any shape or form once expose himself for his own incompetence? Or the interview is all about everybody else's incompetence?
This definitively disproves all of Mark's assertions about everything between Ten Hag and Ronaldo. He made so many assumptions and acted as if Ten Hag absolutely wanted him
I know Souness is out there somewhere asking what Pogba could've done about this...
Saying you don’t respect the manager isn’t the right way to go about it…ETH has kept on saying he wants Ronaldo in the club,ETH has given CR7 loads of opportunities both in the starting XI or from the bench and Ronaldo hasn’t taken his chances this season,we can talk about his 700goals,UCL trophies and Ballon d or but in Football the first XI is picked based on form and right now CR7’s form isn’t at his best.I respect and will always love him for what his done for this Club but what he is doing is a total disrespect to the club and manager…
Ronaldo is a 🐍 & has done his best to de-rail the progression we are making under Ten Hag. He has been in it only for himself. His contract should be terminated with immediate effect.
Sol had no experience so he was on the job learning. You can not really put someone like that down but the others are professionals and should know how to do things best but it depends on executives and what they want? and ETH might be more in their control
lol man utd is a joke of a club these days. well said cr7
This ain't about the glaziers this is about Ronaldo not accepting the truth. Super powers always struggle handing over the reigns. If everyone is honest about this situation Ronaldo is finished at the highest level. Ronaldo will try again gain support before falling on his own sword which he is currently doing
I love Ronald and United he's done here and it hurts but this will help the club as much as it hurts long run
I don’t think ETH disrespects Ronaldo  he’s the manager and it’s obvious he can’t play Ronaldo in the system he’s implementing he’s tried the last 4/5 games and failed miserably
Ronaldo was not and will not be blamed for the terrible way Manchester United has been run for over a decade.
I don't agree with him saying ETH had no respect for him
U Always word things in a way so you follow your ideology lool as much as I like ron and agree with things he said, he has gone about this horribly  he is all about him and he doesn't really care about united fans loool please.... still a legend but yeah he is about himself just has to go
The Ronaldo stand back at it. The man could insult all the academy youngsters and people still wouldn’t care. Realistically he wasn’t forced out he tried to move in the summer but couldn’t find a club he has since not been very good and therefore not played. The only things i agree with our the facilities and the situation with his daughter should have been handled better. He also makes childish narcissistic comments about Rooney and so on it all appears very childish
As long as Shaw, Rashford, McTominay, Bruno, Elanga, Maguire and Martial are at this club Manchester United will never ever be successful. Erik Ten Hag is not good enough nor qualified to be Manchester United Manager.
You agree Rooney is jealous.. what's wrong with you Mark. What Rooney said is what most fans thought.
The haircut on this interview is the same from the 3-0 win against sheriff (after he got suspended). If I had to guess it's from the 27th onwards
DONT THE GLAZERS HAVE TO SELL ?? SURELY???
He isn’t saying he doesn’t like ralf. He is saying it’s awful how they appointed a random person to be the manager of thsi club. Even if rangnick was no manager. The glazers didn’t let him do anytning.
I think it is the position that he was appointed and why and maybe now he is gone ? so what was any of that done in the first place unless something else was planed but that ended badly too and he was saying some truths Ranic
Agree with u mark spot on
Bald Hag isnt as perfect as some Mancs make him out to be xD
Ten hag said what he said about ronaldo before he had even met the squad or the players I think when ten hag met players he found favourites with martial and rashford then when ronaldo returned ten hag already showed disrespect as he had he’s favourites already
Mark is completely right. Ronaldo did wait and had enough. He is not some 20 year old kid that they can do whatever they want, he is on the top and he earned his place there.  I like ETH ideas what he is trying to do but for example he keeps putting Elanga on while Pelistri is waiting YEARS to make his debut. Why he is on the bench if he is not capable? Obviously he is, then give him some time... Here is just one example of another disrespect from ETH.  You know about how the club is managed, if you dont, let me remind you: Martinez price, Antony price oh and did you forget about this one guy that drove all this the whole summer? Frankie...  The truth is harsh but someone finally had the balls and actually the position to speak out.
The timing of the interview 😂lol his a joke
A billionaire narcissist with a god complex had an interview with a phone hacker, the former painted himself as a victim... and then went on to disrespect the only man that defended him when he was acting like a spoiled child.... also, the only victim in his story was the girl from Sin City
he disrespected the club but it’s because he’s the goat so it’s okay
He's the greatest of all time. VIVA RONALDO!!!
Jesus Christ, a player has come out and openly said “I don’t respect the manager” and you are trying to defend him for an hour straight
considering that CR7 ripped Rangnick, hopefully he provides context and details... otherwise, it is an unnecessary attack on someone that was treated very poorly by United and the greater English football community
If he doesn't respect Ten Hag, he should leave.
He just come for the fans and for sir alex we need to respect him as fans he could join city but had respect for us
Trust Ronaldo to win the Golden boot at the World Cup knowing he’s out in January - Will always be a Legend of the club - Very sad time but the development under ETH can now take off… GLAZERS OUT! 🔴🔴🔴
Moral of the story never let your Ex back into your life, or vice versa, as it never ends well.
Maguire will be next on the bandwagon - saying Ten Hag doesn't respect me - when he can't win his first team place back.
No one wants to hear  ETH criticised …yet , wait until next season when there’s no champions league football and u all round on ten hag 😅
I stand with Ronaldo. He is absolutely right about the club. Glazers out
How does it feel to be cucked?
Ronaldo needs to go. Talk about making this all about you, just after a win and to distract from the club through the whole world cup break.   Whether he's right or wrong, you can't go and do an interview and air your dirty laundry about the club publically like that
Loves the fans but was gonna go to City. Yeah ok Ronnie mate. Hes obv took no notice of what's been goin on at Utd since he left otherwise he wouldn't of been shocked when he returned but yeah, he loves the club right? He completely contradicts himself. On the other hand someone of his stature calling out how we've been run is always welcome.
Yes Ronaldo knows how to whinge and moan but I respect his interview as speaks volumes especially towards... glazers out!!!
90 percent  of the fanbase will know fall into two camps The fans who want Ronaldo to leave and will blame Him no matter what and the Ronaldo fanboys/defenders   the fanbase will tear each over apart and the other 10 percent with enough sense to just want to get the glazers out and be impartial will get caught in the crossfire left to rebuild whatever’s left
The man loses a child and you the only thing that comes is results... you don't have empathy
How can CR possibly say that he loves the fans when he has refuses to play for us?
When The Truth is given you can not take it :) I am laughing at this. We all know he wanted to go and something was holding him from that. But sometimes someone has to do the hard thing and I believe he is the one that did it.
"I'm not coming out" 🤣🤣
Every criticism that Ronaldo targetted against the Glazers and the Board was already well known. I agree with those parts but it isn't a revelation. And the part about "I don't respect EtH because he doesn't respect me" is meaningless finger pointing. Why did he not provide examples of how EtH doesn't respect him? Sounds like a lot of bollocks. CR7 supposedly agreed to this interview to defend himself but all the quotes I've seen are all general with no details. Its on the front page of The Sun, which shows how deep and meaningful it really is.
One thing we learn Eric ten hag will be a winner soon. Ronaldo cares about Ronaldo, and united will move on, no one is bigger than the club even cr7
Ronaldo Stand crumbles 😂😂
Why are we fixated on the manager 'lying' about him being 'ill'. If they knew about the interview and wanted to keep him away from the game today so the team was focused, then theyre hardly going to be open about the truth in a pre match presser. It would kind of defeat the point of trying to keep the focus on the game smh 🤦🏻
I agree during June July something must have brokendown and this prompted his wanting to leave and the sub treatment. Man United is a joke im starting to think LVG JoSe and all the ones who left have been right.
The Media will speak about Ronaldo’s comments on the coaches, but never about his comments about how the Club is run, the club is run badly, GLAZERS OUT!🔰
first of all- choosing piers morgan to do the interview is such an odd choice, second his ego i so big anything less than red carpet treatment - which he isnt getting from ten hag is not good enough for the so called best player in the world -
What happened to Rooney when he said the club lacked ambition??
Ronaldo is literally one of the greatest players to ever play the sport, people going against him instantly is so senseless especially since we all wanted the glazers to be exposed and who better to do it. Ronaldos season started with him already having issues with how he was being treated in regards to his family.  I also don't like how he handled the Ten hag thing but clearly he wanted to get stuff of his chest and even though I don't like it I've got to respect the honesty.  Also i remember how excited I was to get a new coach or an interim coach in Rangnick, but as time went on he did the samething Ole did, so I honestly understand Ronaldo saying that about him coz I've seen him be as good as Ole regardless of the players.
Behave Mark! Pull your c*ck out of Ronaldo! You say United haven’t handled this well but Ronaldo didn’t need to put an interview out. Ego at its finest from Ronaldo and not accepted his decline. Ronaldo has been a brilliant player over his career but not since his return to United.
Wow! Ronaldo comes out with the truth, on the day Garnacho shows everybody he is the truth.
Ratnaldo can leave
We wanted this, we asked for someone to talk. We get it to happen and all of you complain about it. 😂. I am glad he said it. We aren’t up to par and he’s telling us and the world.
RONALDO DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING AGAINST CLUB & FANS. He said about board and coach, let’s enjoy World Cup now ❤
Flaming the glazers is one thing but you cant disrespect the former and *CURRENT* manager and not expect to be dismissed. Ronaldo is one of the best to ever do it but his time here might be up. Sorry to say 🙃
Wayne Rooney said it best...Ronaldo is a distraction Manchester United dont need.He should have left at the start of the season.
15:04 I love mark so much 😭
ETH said he wanted Ronaldo publicly but never wanted him to play as his main man which makes me wonder was he told he will be a 5 min sub for the season.
Quick video? Lol
People getting on his side baffle me... how many times are we gonna say, NOBODY IS BIGGER THAN THE CLUB
The way you weaponise the glazers out movement is nothing short of disgusting... yes ronaldo makes some points about Manchester united, but these are all things that were well known and talked about prior to him joining - does his team really not do due diligence? This is very clearly an attempt to undermine the club which is making progress while sidelining ronaldo, something his ego can't take. And he has "fans" like you parroting his lines and fighting his side. If it was ANY other player, they would be universally called out for their complete and utter lack of professionalism - look how the lukaku interview was treated last year. Ronaldo wanted to leave, and contrary to what he says, the glazers were very widely reported to be the reason he remained at the club. His narrative goes completely against his own actions and what has been reported previously.
Piers Morgan is a sensationalist interviewer who manipulates and deceives for likes. Ronaldo used to be a very good player.
Ronaldo has been made the sacrificial lamb. I generally believe he came back to Manchester United with the best intensions for the fans and the success of our club. The Glazers and their cronies are loving this while bleeding this club dry.
The intro🐐😂
Disagree and see ya later Ronaldo
Did anyone really think mark was gonna criticism this the Ronaldo stand  he could of said he hates united and mark still would of backed him
Ronaldo is such a coward and diva. The disrespect he has shown is unforgivable. Everythin has to be about him. Cant wait to see him cancelled. Absolute mug
I think in hindsight it was a bad move. You don't go back to your ex Mrs and I think the same thing applies here. Best thing we can do is get Ronnie a new club. Wish him the best and move on. Best for all parties.
He said what needed to be said and im happy. ETH can go do his best but Ronaldo has a big footprint on this club than any other player in the last 20 years. He is a legend and we all know the situation was crazy and im happy Ronaldo has put it out there.
Ronaldo is spot on ragnick was an unknown
The Glazer's are broke yep they haven't got any more loans left if you know you know super league next year folks that's their only way out
The comment about rangnick is a disgrace
“I don’t respect Erik Ten Hag” who gives a crap about whatever else he said in the interview whether you agree with some of it or not. He doesn’t deserve to play for united again as long as Ten Hag is in charge. Cut the ties in January.
Its a recent interview because he talk back about what rooney said
I have only one question. What about Pogba?
Many United fans kn that ETH is showed disrespect to CR7  That is True.
CR7 need to understand that you can never perform like ferguson regim give those young players chance bcs you are in end of your carrier Erik need to build his team to be best everyone love CR7 for the good job at trafford just relax like your old legend do when you came to trafford at your young age,all this happen bcs you benched by Erik i still love you no dought bcs you are a legend
I cannot stand Ronnie now, what a spoilt brat We are better without him anyways
Men this team is bad realy bad look Di Maria out of man u and retrive some level.
Ten Hag probably told him he wasn't an automatic starter. Ronaldo crys
ronaldo has lost a child.... could he be in a dark place???... mental health???
GLAZERS OUT! OUT! OUTTTT!
Lad you need to take your ten hag googles off
I wonder who fans will blame next after Ronaldo leaves. This situation makes me want to give up on united
Anyone who sides with the bald solskjaer and the club aren't United fans they glazer fans and apologists.
I told you all that would not end well. Mark Goldbridge is a disgrace. Ronaldo disrespects the club and can't find it in his heart as a Ronaldo fanboy to renounce his statements about United to a jerk like Morgan. This is disgraceful; Ronaldo will not allow United to enjoy a good moment. It has to be about him and not the club or its future.
You either leave as a hero, or stay long enough to become the villain
If anyone backs Ronaldo on this it’s an absolute disgrace, the guy is so far up his own arse.
He’s coming to win the league at Arsenal Sueeeeeeeeuewwewuueee
15:03 Love how Mark always thinks he's made a sexual innuendo even when discussing a serious topic
I’m sure Ronaldo is aware of what he’s doing and saying and knows he won’t have a chance to play anymore. It’s important because it provides us as fans a solid outlet of the reality the state the club is in. While Ronaldo’s approach is damaging to his reputation and his credibility (lack of humility and arrogance) we can’t deny the fact that his words are honest to an extent. Nevertheless ETH will make the right decision and Ronaldo will accept the consequences.
I used to back the whole 'nobody is bigger than the club' idea but over the last 10 years I've seen this club change on such a deep level that it's no longer recognisable as the same club. Everything that made this club great has slowly been broken down and scrapped by the leeches that own it, Ronaldo is from an era when Manchester United were a juggernaut and the whole ethos was based on respect and winning, now it's all about who can be thrown under the bus to cover the owners and to disguise the lowering of standards. I don't remember us constantly moving from blaming one individual to another when things went wrong in the past, the whole culture has been nurtured to keep the glazers out of the spotlight as much as possible. It's not for us to decide to condemn Ronaldo now when we have no context as to why he doesn't respect ETH. Let's keep our reactions in check until after it's all released and in context but take it as a win on the whole of you want to get rid of the current owners
Why is anyone backing a man who’s achieved nothing for the club over a man who’s achieved everything for the club ? If you back Ten Hag over Ronaldo who highlighted the problems at the club and reacted to disrespect by the new manager, you have your priorities wrong. The only man who would talk about all the problems that have us in our longest trophy drought in half a century !!!!
RONALDO IS SIMPLY SHOWING ALL OF US WHO HE REALLY IS....REMEMBER WHAT BONNUCCI SAID ABOUT HIM AFTER HE LEFT JUVENTUS? HE SAID THE DRESSING ROOM HAD BEEN LIBERATED BY RONALDO LEAVING.
yeah i don’t respect the way he came at erik ten hag
Ronaldo moving the bottle of Coke to the side. Put commercialism aside and speak the truth.
Cristiano Ronaldo is a legend here and this would never change anytime. But i would agree that this Ronaldo situation could have been dealt in a much better way at the start of the situation by the club and now holding him not playing him that does feels disrespecting him.
Ragnick was a joke appointment
I agree with mark I agree with ronaldo slating the club the board and the owners but I hate the fact he slated ralf and ten Haag but let’s all hope we get the full truth on Wednesday
He wants to get out of the club...and wants united to bin the contract so they wont get any transfer fee..Ronaldo doesn't care about anyone but himself!!
Do you really think Ronaldo loves the club and the fans? The man loves ONLY himself, there is no one else except him in his delusional universe. Stop being naive
How can you say that Ronaldo is right when he has been disrespectful and rude to his former and current coach?  He is speaking very badly about United that, although what he says is true, saying it in public makes him a bad professional.
Leaves a sour taste in the mouth. Was looking forward to seeing CR7 in WC but now I couldn’t care less
The last chapter of MUFC and Ronaldo is a sad one. However, I’m truly glad that a honest reflection of how the club is decaying—and being driven by vultures—is out.   Hopefully this story will echo around the world, and bring tremendous scrutiny and pressure upon the Glazers, deservedly.
It’s all over now. I just don’t understand why he did the interview. It’s good to call things out, but there are ways to do things.
Fans are a disgrace at this club. Ronaldo hasn't been playing well because the club has turned its back on him as I guessed. He missed pre season because of his daughter. Did you all forget his other kid died last year? He has very right to worry about family. I'm sick of rival fans or fans in general trasing him when they couldn't make it through a fast food shift because there pet gerbil died. He isn't finished as a player. He is finished with the club.  I don't understand how people are upset. I just don't get it. I've already said my point 100 times in your comment section the last few months.  I'm ready for the old Ronaldo at WC.
If we would have just behaved like an elite club since he left...who knows maybe things would have played out differently.
“If you want a rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain“ ☔️ Which great philosopher said that..?    Dolly Parton 👀😅
Cristiano at this point lost the plot completely. Ruined his legacy. Disrespecting and undermining manager and his choices is worst thing player can do. His ego is as big as the Sun. Get his toxic ass out of Man Utd. He should have never came back in the first place.
He probably should leave after whats happened. Its best for both parties. But i respect Ronaldo. Remember as fans, we deserve honesty which is what he brought. We deserve to no the truth, not some rubbish propaganda about the glazers. 👍 What he said totally exposes the problem with the club, maybe the timing was harsh, and disrespect to ten hag was too much. Still
This interview was done just after the transfer window closed. Does nobody remember him saying, 'the fans will know the truth in a few weeks'....
I love Ronaldo ;I love ten Hag. I don't Iike partly the way this club is run in terms of the ownership and it's executive decisions. Clearly, Ronaldo has been in the wrong to some extent with the manager but he's been majorly pushing in the right direction with regards of his interaction with the owners of this football club.
Made some decent points about the lack of investment and the while ralph debacle but coming for EtH is a step too far, given him plenty of chances and he’s not delivered. Past it now lad, only person that cant see that is ronaldo
Completely agree with Ronnie, the club is a shambles.
RESPECT THE LEGEND SIIIIIIIIIIUUUUUUU
Love to hear roy keanes take on this 🤣
The interview he's been planning for months .. what a absolute loser Ronaldo is. Can't compete on the pitch anymore among the elite but clearly doesn't have the mentality  to perform with the elite either   Ten hag gave him chance after chance after the pre season tour, even made him captain as recent as last week. Always openly and publicly defended him in the media and then this guy demands respect!? No, how about you show respect towards the manager
Portuguese here☝🏻 Wtf is happening with Ronaldo? The timing of this words... There is nothing to be gained from this honestly. Nothing. Doesn't make any sense saying all the things about is own club and he's coach. I'm absolutely lost with all this...
This truly breaks my heart. But this exposes the glazers just like we wanted.
If You say A You have to Say B. You cant cririsize Ralf Ragnick´s coaching abilities, but not mention Solskjær! Nah, Ronaldo is just ofended, that Ten hag and Ralf  Ragnick did not see him him as Gods gift tohumanity. ( Not starting every game) NO ONE IS BIGGER THAN THE CLUB. This is the mentality Ragnick and Ten Hag is practicing, and Ronaldo cant take that. What a disgrace.
mark dont forget ronaldo first language is not english i think what he is saying is that rangnick was brought to the club not as a coach and then they put him coach of united instead if getting a very good manager
The GOAT has spoken. The one player since Fergie who still put on the shirt with pride and was genuinely hurt when he saw the club has regressed since Fergie. Obviously, the player is not bigger than the club, and the manager is someone who we have to back but I love Ronaldo and he will forever be a legend at Man Utd. This had to be Ronaldo's famous last words... i do not see how he plays for Utd again
If this is pogba people will be sending him death treats
Talk the truth when you leave the club and not while you expect to still get your salary. Hes right and true but theres a time and place. Have a go at the owner! To disrespect his current manager shows sheer arrogance. Still cant believe people defend him. Its rude and very unprofessional.
Any player who thinks he is "bigger" than the manager should be expelled from the club.
Grande Ronaldo. This interview doesn't change what I think of him. He set his legacy in stone a long time ago for me. Thanks for exposing United Leadership for what it is, a joke. GOAT.
He come back as Legend. getting out as Villain
Okay now is done. CR7 not have respect to Man United. I hope soon Man United terminate Ronaldo contract.
Of course Mark defends ronaldo... How many times is it now that Ronaldo makes the headlines about him after the team has just won a match where he hasnt been involved in... But of course, its CR7 so whatever he says, we have to give him the benefit of the doubt... I've lost my respect for CR, and starting to loose interest in this chanel...
Yeah, I said that and benched him the whole time
He should leave his football do the talking he hasn't preformed this season end of story and he is thrown his toys out the pram
Nobody bigger than the club. Time to leave I'm afraid, fair enough to Diss the club, the owners but not ten hag. Ten hag  is our way out of 10 years of shite. Ronaldo isn't.
Everyone: "Lukaku has disrespected his club and given the worst interview ever." Ronaldo: "hold my agua..."
It is always about him every time. He is not bigger than the club. Simple !!!
So making him captain against Villa and loose the game was to humiliate him and label him a bad leader I guess..  And some Players seem to be involved in this.
The Christiano Rinaldo who got off the bench and drove home. And you dont go whinging to Morgan.
Glazer’s Out
Ronaldo is still a legend but it will be great when he finally leaves and takes these annoying fanboys (even the ones in this comment section) with him
You can see that ronaldo is not confident whit this team and ETH . And if what he said is truth he should leave and we should thank him for what he had done.
All i can say is there is some level of respect he has for Utd that he waited until the break to release this.  He knows he will be going after this. Its clear the frustrations have been evident on both sides. I think its a big shame the club couldnt let him find a solution in the summer.  The board are TOTALLY to blame for this - what we could ALL see coming!! I think his comments on ETH are absolutely unfair & definitely the end of him & ETH's relationship.  The club again totally screwed up the summer along with the FDJ saga! We should have let him go & part on good ways with the club. Ronaldo showed he was fully committed last season...our top scorer...otherwise it would have been a terrible terrible season....BUT the club could have given him a way out in the summer & given ETH a new striker. This was ALWAYS going to end this way. His behaviour not sitting on the bench was a disgrace but it wouldnt have happened if we gave him the transfer & bought in a striker we so badly badly need. At least this is done pre world cup...& he will get a solution in Jan...the club better sign ETH a striker!!!!! It is a shame this board manage to always make a soap opera out of our club...when this could have been solved months ago....but for whatever reason they didnt want to buy a replacement striker & created this crazy situation for Ten Hag. It is very sad to see Ronaldo & Utd end this way but it has to now. Our board & owners have to go...their decision making is  ludicrous & insane..they single handedly have jeopardised all the work ETH is doing to create a unity & team spirit... I blame Ronaldo for his petulance but the club could have found a solution WELL before the beginning of the season!!!  Ronaldo has told us exactly what he thinks about the board's management...from technology, infrastructure to the same Jacuzzi he used more than 10 years ago!!  The Glazers have let the club come to ruins....he has just outted the club...& just supports why we need the Glazers Out!!
Glazers out , ronaldo out, end of.
Send him to chelsea
Why did it have to come to this
He's done with United . We are better without him. No one is bigger than the Club. Let's see where he goes in January
Man this guy is toxic af, just need to move on.
He said he doesn't  respect ten hag mate. His manager?    He should  indeed get out of my club.
Get this guy out of the club already
boxing fight?
that's his behavior never grown up...finished fake self claim goat...
Pendulum is FINISHED he will always live in Messi’s shadow. Not my goat!
The ten hag comments are the ones that really bother me and ngl I think it’s all down to ronaldo ego because a mangier for the first time in he’s career has gone on second thought I don’t see you as a first team player and I bet that really hurt ronaldo
Eric come back to us we need you. They call you allready a layer. Come back to a real footballclub and run away from these clowns.
glazers in
Can't believe the bullshit mark has talked , any other he would be on them , favourites done with this channel
GLAZERS OUT NOW!!
CR7 out
I never want to see Ronaldo in the team again. Ten Hag has handled this situation as well as anyone could. Ronaldo has been a petulant child from the start of his tenure. I don’t care about the personal stuff. Everyone has that, and if Ronaldo were the classy professional his well-managed reputation suggests he is, this season would have proceeded dramatically differently. Rashford handled himself and look at his comeback. Ronaldo can go, ASAP.
Other than the disrespectful ETH & Rangnick comments. Everything else he said was facts
Smh, not
Really want a Rangnick interview to hear his assessment of the club
People care about ronaldo out more than glazers out. That is alarming.
Problem is so much of the media will run with the anti ten hag comments and marginalise the comments about the glazers and state of the club.  Edit: It’s already all ‘they tried to force me out’ ‘they don’t respect me’ ‘what’s he doing saying this now’ ‘petulance from a disgruntled player’ etc. Not a single mention of comments about the shambolic state of the club.
no one club wants him
This just shows why we don’t need him at our club anyone who supports ronaldo aren’t united fans they’re ronaldo fans he loves the drama
Brazy
The relationship with the club affected his performances
The man shouldn't respect him too...Nonsense
glazers out
