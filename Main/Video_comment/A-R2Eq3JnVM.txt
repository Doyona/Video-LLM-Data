Villager :i escaped  the baby  I must be god
I think whoever made this needs to take a frickin IQ test
The villager is looking to the closest way to the bed with the least entities (I think), so it went back around to the tnt as the tnt turned into the tnt entity, basically juking the nincompoop little half witted baby zombie, gosh I truly hate those things.
He outsmarted the baby villager wow

Villager big brain
I‘d say 9/10 since he went back for a sec
History Lessons China has a long history of divine culture. During the Sui Dynasty, for example, five plague gods were seen above the capital city in 592. A major plague then broke out that year, causing a high number of deaths. The Emperor of Wendi, a strong believer of Buddhism, ordered more temples to be built and encouraged his subjects to strengthen faith in and worship the divine.  Such a tradition continued to recent China. Xuyun (1840 – 1959), one of the most renowned monks in recent Chinese history, had lived through five emperors in the Qing Dynasty until communist China.  During the war with Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900, Emperor Guangxu together with Empress Dowager Cixi fled to Xi’an of Shaanxi Province in August, and Xuyun was invited to join. It was summer and plague broke out, leaving many people dying, with rotting corpses throughout the city. In addition to advising the emperor to call on the wealthy for donations as a remedy, Xuyun also vowed to pray at Wolong Temple for mercy from the divine to end the plague.  Nearly 1,000 monks joined the event and Xuyun led nine of them to continue praying at a ten-yard high platform. Seven days into the ceremony, snow fell. Other monks returned to inside the temple, with only Xuyun remaining at the platform. He continued meditating, praying for additional snow to alleviate the damage caused by the drought and plague in the region. More snow arrived, and everywhere was covered with snow. Impressed by the miracle and sincerity, Empress Dowager Cixi came kneeling down on the snow in front of the platform to thank Xuyun.  But all the divine culture was wiped out after the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took power in 1949. In early 1951, for example, officials in Hunan Province required all nuns to get married in days, while young monks were forced to join the army. Xuyun, already over 110 at the time, was targeted as a counter-revolutionist. When the Buddhism Association of China was established in 1952 and CCP officials promoted monks and nuns to get married and stop their vegetarian diets, Xuyun attempted to intervene. As a result, he was detained with no food, water, or access to a bathroom. Military police officers also beat him and broke his ribs.
Ooooohh sheesh At first I just thought he was just gonna make it to the end but nah, he actually just outplays the zombie too😨😨

What actually happened: When the villager pressed the pressure plate, the tnt fell down, which made the game cause the villager to walk back to the other path, since there was no block to support the villager. The baby zombie was already on that path and kept the momentum, then fell down, making this a 1000 play by the villager because he used the game’s script to his advantage in a sticky situation.
TOOK BABY ZOMBIE'S ANKLES ON THAT TNT RUN DAMMMMMMMMM
