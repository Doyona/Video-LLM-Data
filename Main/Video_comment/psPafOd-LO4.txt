Bruh you just predicted the ikaris plot twist
Watched it last night and you were spot on with the Areshem call, well done ^^
I can't believe Ahrisham shows up at the end and takes the eternals that prevented the birth of the celestial. Everyone on earth can see Ahrisham and they freak out.
I can't believe what ikarus does!!! I like how the deviant evolves and learns the truth. I feel bad for Gilgamish. Awesome movie!!! I'm going to rewatch it in a few minutes. W o w!
Damn I gonna watch eternals on theatre 🎭
7 days, 7000 years, 7 eternals (all seemingly from different ethnicities which could mean) - 7 continents. Maybe they just like the number 7
Marvel's Back at it again showing us a backwards-ass story from the Bible.
Ikaris isn’t a villain in MCU history. It’s more than a leap to suggest or forecast that, they would flip the character just as an element to provide context. If this were to happen, I would be very,very surprised. Throw it up on the wall…see if it sticks… hopefully not. Ikaris is their ‘Superman don’t ruin that… I hope.
Keep reaching Paul! :D
I can already tell this movie is gonna be S tier.
Very Good! Don’t normally go bonkers on Marvel BUT this got me curious. So thanks for all the catch up and your analysis on what’s up… Time will tell if you’re right, hope so!😅
I heard of the comic, which was short lived in its original run but the Eternals are going to be new to me. The Celestials I know about for a long time. It'll be good to see if the massive Celestial appears, who we know as the disembodied head called Knowhere.
This movie gives me a real Guardians of the Galaxy vibe... practically unknown, deep cuts comic characters who make up the ensemble we'll get to know & love. Hopefully like GotG, because there's no expectations of super well known characters to live up to, it'll be another home run film.   These characters all seem like they're god-tier powered characters and I'm Excite Bike 64 to see what kinda damage they'll do to the baddies :D  PS - YOU DA BEST! I've been a huge fan ever since the running Mephisto jokes and I've gone back to watch practically all of your videos - KEEP UP THE UH-MAZE-ZING WORK BRUV!!
I think Icaris and Ajax were attacked at the farm and Ajax died as a result.  You can assume Icaris is holding on to Ajax's body as he rages in mourn.  Probably the reason why you don't see her in the rest of the movie.  Which kinda sux because I love the idea of Salma Hayek saying a badass leading role.
Anyone else reminded of homelander when they see icarus use his laser eyes?
Marvel is know on the way of getting the audience fall in love with their cosmic characters. Amazing.
I'm wondering if Ikaris kills Ajak. His eyes are glowing at the wasteland house scene, then you never really see Ajak in the present scenes, only during the flashbacks. Maybe he's set on carrying out the emergence because he doesn't actually love humans?
I'm obsessed with ur channel. All the way from Oklahoma💗💗💗💗
Thanks for letting us know how shitty this movie will be. Basically these eternals are behind every human inventions...they will later say that Tony Stark was son of one of white eternal that is why he was genius.
I have a feeling Eternals is going to go DEEP into MCU cannon we've never seen before...
I'm skipping Shang Chi and Externals as they didn't excite me. Spiderman NWH and Dr Strange 2 are the only Marvel films that I wanna watch in this average Phase 4.
I'm still hyped for this movie, a fan of Kirby's Eternals but still looking forward to this
I’m so excited, definitely loved this break down. Got me pumped even more for this
I don’t think Ikaris is evil. If anything, it’s Kro shape shifting as him if it’s truly a sinister scene.
I hope that they don't kill off Ajax
From the info I've received....Angelina Jolie's character is the traitor of the group.
thanos can be a deviat his parent are
If there's not a giant celestial chillin in San Francisco by the end of the movie I will be a bit disappointed.
I personally can’t wait for this movie
I think him becoming the black knight will be part of after credits. I am so excited for this, I cry every time. Can't wait to be back in the Cinemas sharing bonding moments with fellow fans. Can't wait for live reactions in there too. Marvel Comics Studios everything are the best!!!
Hope the driver is ok
what if thanos succeeded in snapping the universe from existence during endgame, do the eternals still have that do not interfere mindset?
The captain Rodgers comment was big considering its 5 years after the snap and Sam Wilson being cap is maybe months after
Okay, okay.. but why is Homelander in the movie? :P j/k, I know it's Icarus, but I can't NOT see Homelander in the laser-eyes shots.
I don't think its the Deviants being awoken at all, its the Celestial egg that's been awoken by the energy spike and its a race against time {7 days) for the Eternals to stop it. Looks to me that a lot of the Deviant combat is set in the past with some action in the present but remember Thanos was actually a part Deviant (in the comic books) so I think the Deviants will be a persistent threat but not the main driving force of the plot.
This movie is gonna BOMB so hard
NECROSWORD. BRO, COLLECTOR SAID IN MARVEL'S WHAT IF EPISODE 2 THAT HELLA USED A NECROSWORD!  Does this mean KNULL is the next big bad of the MCU? KNULL, the god of void, the god of symbiotes, the dude that ripped sentry in half. Shiz we fooked.  In comics Thor defeated Symbiots knull sent to earth before. There's also an eternals movie coming, eternals who knull hates. And the venom and Spiderman movies are doing well. And the MCU have been to "nowhere" before with the he collector, you know, nowhere which is the severed head of an eternal that knull killed with the NECROSWORD and then forged the symbiotes in.  What does this mean. Did hella serve knull. Did knull corrupt Hella. Did knull give her the necrosword. Will it be used. Is that why Hella hated Thor. someone gimme some answers bro!
My biggest hope is that this leads to marvel using less green screen
Rob Stark got no luck with Cerseis, amiright?
Tiffany ‎ ‎ ‎
You're my number one source for getting updated on all things comic book. Thanks for sharing your knowledge with all of us have a wonderful day
I do NOT like the little girl EXTERNAL
Great breakdown! If the Babylon seen is caused by King that would be a great tie-in for events moving forward!
I dont wanna get runed
"She's MY QUEEN"- A simp
Are the Eternals powerless in the TVA?
Paul calling out the haters👌 so yall know he is inevitable!
I really liked the whole celestials news design they are really well modernized I think 🥰
🥰
Still not sold they seem to powerful
Yea I has 0 expectations for this but def more pumped for it thanks as always ✌
I wonder if the woke will ruin this movie as well.
What if that shape shifting deviant leader shape shifted to Icaris and killed Ajax? Would make for an interesting twist
All i know is we need more Hayek in the MCU 😍
Awesome to see Robb stark and Jon snow on screen again
So none of the eternals were snapped away? Seems like they would have met up before 5 years went by
Looking forward to The Eternals movie! :) Thanks for breaking down these trailers. Keep up the great work!
Nice
That’s so funny .
erm... isnt Thanos half deviant or has the deviant syndrome?
As an actor, shouldn’t Hayak be able to handle basic enunciation? Really takes the audience out of the moment, tbh.
What if that shape shifting deviant leader shape shifted to Icaris and killed Ajax? Would make for an interesting twist
""""Someone who had accidentally found this channel and now addicted to this channel 💚💗"'""
definition was a better moniker. 😳🤫😏
not the fall Babylon but the Conquest of Mexico
I suspect the volcano is Thera, Krakatoa or Ambrym.
Good to see Jon Snur on the telly again.
Ahem.  At the 3:32 mark in your video, Ajak comforting Phastos IN CURRENT TIME PERIOD OUTFITS.  No?
If Ikaris turns out to be the bad guy, I'm gonna be really disappointed.
Can i pls get a reimbursement. I smashed the like and subsrcibe button and broke my screen...
“If you don’t want anything runed” heh heh I see whatcha did there
i leave a comment not to be in the drawing  but to support Paul
I don’t like the machine idea
the deviants have always been on earth, same as eternals. the power spike from snap, has called the celestials back, not deviants. basically the event is a culling of earth. seems you got some facts mixed up
I’m here for the ramblings
Does anyone remember when everybody was giving a report to black window and the lady from wakanda said they felt a huge shake in the earth from so far away maybe that was the asteroid that landed
No one is going to talk about the hourglass rune that appeared in the end title card that matches the symbols on the the doors to the time keepers at the tva? Really? I can’t possibly be the only one who noticed.
I really like the Ikaris theory. It makes sense bc at least one of them will have to kinda defect or betray the group. It’s usually not the first guess, which would be Druig. I was thinking Phastos
I think it’s unlikely that Ikaris will be villainous in this movie. But perhaps he will be shown as the most detached from humanity of the eternals and is afraid of change i.e: not being with circe.
Considering Ikaris was a key character in the comics, I sure hope they haven’t actually turned him evil.
I thought kit harringtons charactor was an eternal. Thank god he's a normal person. I don't want to watch another Kissing Booth plot line between circie and iceris
I am getting homelander vibes from Ikaris 👀
The Celestials allowed Thanos to create the snap which would wake the sleeping Celestial in the Earth. No snap, no Celestial, no reason for Eternals.
I don’t think ikaris will be bad lol
Just wait patiently for the Spidey trailer ffs
Can we please shut the fuck up about the Spiderman trailer!? We've had ONE Marvel out of the year so far with TWO others coming.
I am already completed invested in this film and I can’t wait for its theatrical release. This is definitely a big screen film
Just wait for knull😏
I never thought of this actually
Big Justice League vibes.
I thnk Eternals will again hide themselves after this movie. The reason being their power levels, they all look overpowered and hibernating them is Marvel's thing!!
i was really happy they were doing an eternals movie loved the comic but after waiting 2 years i find myself not really that interested anymore not watched any of the new marvel content
Absolutely loved the trailer and the breakdown
Really looking forward to this movie!
This movie looks awesome and I think it ties in more to what has gone on in the MCU recently than originally thought.
Where are rest of Avengers in this new threat to Earth . Marvel hide them in order to project Eternals . There should be interactions between them in this period.  Captain Marvel is alone too much powerful than the Eternals . Marvel is just plotting to much Fantasy.
captain reacher with another reach.
I thought Thanos is half-Deviant. If so, then the Eternals should have interfere.
iirc, Thanos is a Eternal and Deviant hybrid, since Celestials created Eternals to defeat Deviants, so technically they should also have the responsibility to stop Thanos
I feel sorry for the MCU tards that never read a comic book.
This is really good it's not what I expected when they were announced back in 2019. Exciting and can't wait for the released in November 🥰🥰
Collab with Eric Voss
Make this make sense, anybody please....Thanos was a Deviant. To me, there must be a Comic book fan among the Marvel Studios elite who can't distinguish between A-list and D-list characters, so sometimes they make a film strictly to serve a small segments of fans, which is ok, but completely throws away their origin without the realization these stories are all connected. It's great to have a real fan as part of the decision making process, but this has it's blind spots too.  I'm going to see the film, but already, we have lay fans asking...."what is the purpose of this film if they allowed Thanos to have his way?" that is, folks who have never read a comic book ever and the entire MCU is just a superhero collective of films.

Looks dark and boring
When you mentioned Vin Diesel, I immediately burst into laughter  then subscribed. Coz, you know, family.
I want to see the rest of Kingo's dance
That ikaris theory or spoilers , I hope that no, because another bad “Superman “ no thanks boooring
If you get sponsored by Ikea now I'm gonna laugh my butt off
There were people complaining about the trailer and how these characters suck. If guardians of the galaxy can be a hit then so can this.
Best trailer, loved it. A Must-Watch now well, I would have watched it anyway (after all it is the MCU).
cant wait for this film, great trailer review
The 1st trailer was forgettable. This final trailer piqued my interest enough to go check it out. It's the first Phase 4 movie I'm genuinely excited about!
"Who knows nothing? Jon Snow."  Love it. 😄
There will be no images of Harington as Dark Knight???????????????
I really hope the "emergence" also includes mutants!
the way that eternals is already eating up all the other mcu movies cinematography and visuals
here’s to hoping marvel is also eternal because as the MCU grows, I keep thinking about being able to watch this with kids and grandkids. Crazy how marvel has stayed relevant for a long time and will continue to do so. So excited for this trailer!!
This movie looks boring ...
Great trailer, hoping the movie surpasses expectations. Truly looking forward to this.
No way home waiting room 😅
What if that shape shifting deviant leader shape shifted to Icaris and killed Ajax? Would make for an interesting twist
Hi I'd just like to say Jesus Christ really loves you please repent of your sins and put your trust in Jesus Christ today
Dane is a big Smiths fan but Cersei? Not so much.
Honestly looks like it could be the best marvel movie released in the last 10 years
Is thanos coming back????
What if that shape shifting deviant leader shape shifted to Icaris and killed Ajax? Would make for an interesting twist

2:56 you better be..
The guy with the camera is actually a bollywood star named harish patel
Judging by the way they are vilifying the celestial and already showed Kro as a villain holding Thena. Knowing Thena has a relationship with Kro in the comics I have a feeling they will use her as a misdirect making us think she is the mole/villain eternal out of the group working with Kro but secretly the true villain is Druig working in the shadows but pretending to be on the good side. The actor that plays Druig just looks like the type of actor that would end up being a super villain lol and also his powers just set him up to be a villain as no superhero would have his ability to control peoples minds as using the power itself is pretty damn sinister. Maybe he will be controlling the deviants minds to make them to bad things and come off as the villains when he was pulling the strings all this time? Also he’s the only eternal we don’t see using his powers in the any of the trailers.
Love your content...............
I can't understand why folks are so excited about this. I have read the Jack Kirby comics. This looks alright. I don't think it will compare to any of the MCU's biggest movies. What If? seems like a hodge podge of stuff too. I hope some of their new additions take off.
Ya, good job, you!
Awesome breakdown, the trailer looks so amazing. I'm excited now
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
thanos is a half-deviant ryt?
No matter how hard they push Shang Chi.. it's just a marvel themed CCP propaganda kung fu movie.. IT. IS. GOING. TO. SUCK.
Here are my thoughts  Earth-X story, I mentioned before that the snap would be a trigger and it was. So snapping back the snapped away created an additional surge to a universe that was already filling that vacuum for 5 years. Life was still going on and perpetuating (Morgan Stark etc.) during that time, and BAM the rest of the population is back. That additional surge of life energy triggers the life essence to wake up the dormant Celestial in Earth. In the trailer that meteor crashing to earth is the Celestial seed being deposited. So the earth has enough life energy now to wake and birth the newest Celestial. it will also trigger the wake of the mutants around the earth to work like the anti-bodies that they were engineered for to protect the planet. And finally, this is definitely going to be noticed by non-other than Galactus.
It seems strange to me that in all the MCU movies so far, we never see a movie poster of Kumail Nanjiani's character. Could be that he only does Bollywood movies tho and we never got to see India in the MCU
Marvel does great job to portray character
Kango.... More like kang with an o
Really rooting for this flick!
I did not know a single thing about The Eternals prior to Marvel announcing this movie and honestly, I am super excited for it. I am most anticipating Dr. Strange 2 for the continuation of the story, but The Eternals has me the most excited as a movie. It looks like it is going to be visually stunning, the story seems like it's going to be amazing and the cast is wonderful! I read a plot leak so ********spoilers************ that Icarus kills Ajax bc she wants to stop the deviants and he wants to follow through with the og plan. I hope it's more of this than your theory no offense. I just feel like it would make for a better internal struggle for Icarus. He has a strict set of rules and plans to follow but he loves his family and the humans. That conflict would be much better than Icarus is a generic villain*********Spoilers END. Either way, I'm hyped to the max for this film and I know it's gonna be amazing. Phase 4 is shaping up to be spectacular!
mind blowing trailer to be honest! hope i win!
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
Looks like trash. I hope I'm wrong.
Here's a theory.... The Celestials used the Mind Stone to activate the Eternals similar to how Vision came to be.
‘Why didn’t you guys help fight Thanos?”  Eternals: His chin makes us uncomfortable.
I know nothing about the Eternals either, but I'm down for a new group of heroes.
Villa s kilt
#5 on Trending!
I love that marvel studios is making movies about the esoteric Marvel characters. In addition to the regular ones like Spiderman and the avengers.
Hey, Love from India 🖤🇮🇳🖤
This trailer got me more excited.
Dude u got a quarter million views in 16 hours and #5 on trending. I think you can pull off the IKEA ad
I really enjoyed the trailer. Wasn’t sure about the Eternals, but now I’m looking forward to it
✝️ Fellowship invite
I think it's the meteor of deviants crashing and the crying scene is actually from the Thanos snap aside from the obvious reachy stuff I pretty much agree with this 100%
I really liked the trailer! I no nothing about the enterals so I'm looking forward to the film x
QUESTION: Kang said he found Eson the searcher at the end of time in Marvel Superheros 2, so how come Eson came here?
Click 👍 Click 👍 Boom 💥
This movie looks intense
Can you do heavy spoilers for “Nine Perfect Strangers” on HULU?? Please !
Eternals are just fallen angels; this is predictive programming for what’s coming in the 7 year tribulation, or 7 days of Daniels 70th week, accept Christ before it’s too late!!!  GOD did It ALL so YOU Don’t have to!!!  I’m here trying to save souls before the tribulation starts, the only thing that you  have to do to be saved is believe! once you believe in what God did for us on the cross then your soul is sealed:  “Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God? Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.  “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭5:24‬ ‭KJV‬‬  “Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this?” ‭‭John‬ ‭11:25-26‬ ‭KJV‬‬  ‭John 6:28-29 KJV‬  “All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.” ‭John 6:37 KJV‬  “Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.” ‭John 6:47 KJV‬  “He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.” ‭John 7:38 KJV‬  Romans 10:9-10 "That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved."  you seem like a person who is searching out for the truth, so in case you never heard the true Gospel or meaning of the Bible i'll post it here:   The truth of the Bible 1. we are all sinners, no 1 sin is better or worse than any other sin when it comes to salvation  2. God being a Holy God cannot intermingle with sin hence humanity was cast down to earth 3. here we have the option to see both sides, evil and good 4. We can choose to mend our relationship with God by believing in the sacrifice he made for us through Jesus Christ to be saved so that our sins may be forgiven and we may die to our sins so our spirit may be saved 5. Those who do not want to be with God he will also let them choose that and so that is what hell is, it’s separation from our father, if everything good and righteous comes from our father then hell is just a place where none of Gods attributes reaches.  If you believe this then you can be saved all you have to do is:  As a repentant sinner Look into your heart and confess: Dear God I am a wretched sinner, as I repent I put my faith that Jesus is God and that he died buried and resurrected so that his blood can wash away my sins I put my faith in that alone to save me not my good works in Jesus name I pray Amen.  Romans 10:9-10 "That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved."
I’m really just hoping a post credit scene shows Dane being heavily teased as Black Knight
I seen the celestial and my jaw droppppped. Im such a fuckin weeb for being excited lmfaoo
Brilliant explanation. Short and sweet. Brevity can be a beautiful thing
I’m so excited for this movie!! Thx for the breakdown!
Hellooooooo baby
Trash. No one wants to see this garbage movie. Its trash. No one is interested. Its a joke.
Deff more hyped for this than shang chi
Love your content!! Stay safe everyone ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️👍
So what’s blue
Black Knight: I'll kill the bad guy!  Arya: Hold my wine!
Although I don't know anything about the Eternals because I never read the comics, I'm excited for the movie. And this video was helpful and I understood the characters and plot better. But boy it was overwhelming, too much information and too much to process lol. So I'll be watching it off and on so I'll understand everyone better. Is it me tho or did anybody else wished they had choose other actors? I mean some of them are fine but meh I would've wished for some other actors that I liked.
I wish my wife had your voice
That ship looking like a Kit-Kat bar LOL I'm not the only one seeing this? Did Kit-Kat sponsor Marvel?😂😂😂😂
Looks like another win for Marvel.  Thanks for the breakdown
But now what piety without truth? what truth (what saving truth) without the word of God? What word of God (whereof we may be sure) without the Scripture? The Scriptures we are commanded to search, John 5:39, Isa. 8:20. They are commended that searched and studied them, Acts 17:11 and 8:28-29. They are reproved that were unskillful in them, or slow to believe them, Matt. 22:29, Luke 24:25. They can make us wise unto salvation, 2 Tim. 3:15. If we be ignorant, they will instruct us; if out of the way, they will bring us home; if out of order, they will reform us; if in heaviness, comfort us; if dull, quicken us; if cold, inflame us..
I like the trailed the sense of lore and the pace was good.
Could it be possible that the Emergence that they mentioned refers to the Emergence of a young celestial from th cosmic egg that is the earth..
The eternals give me vibes to Sense 8 lol anyone else?
You deserve an ikea sponsor for not milking the lack of a no way home trailer with constant update videos 🥲
Icarus sure does look cool, but I think DC did laser eyes better
Icarus shooting laser eyes uncontrollably might be because he's controlled by Druid
How this is going to be bigger and make the MCU more is going to be so awesome!!
This movie will be my introduction to the Eternals. I'm excited to see it!
Question if the Eternals fight the deviants and Thanos was born with the deviant gene then why couldn't the Eternals stop him seems like he would be just the sort of enemy they should be looking for or am I mistaken?
This was a great breakdown and made me more interested in this movie than I was previously..
That’s a poor theory Icarus is not gonna be bad
Your IKEA sponsor joke had me 🤣🤣🤣
Looking forward to this. Thanos is a deviant right? Which would make him fair game to the Eternals
I need a joint every time i click just so relaxed
永恒族
*WHY didn't you help fight Thanos in the first place The movie would have ended in 5 minutes*  Our contracts weren’t signed yet and MONEY and we weren't even cast yet :D
Nice breakdown! love your contents!
FAKE COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOPIES CHARACTERS noone notice :D WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW the best movie in this year
I tried watching without adblocker, but I turned it back on after three ads. Four ads in less than twelve minutes is a bit much.
jon snow and rob stark back together yay
Movie is now called Eternals and not The Eternals like it was before
I'm sure the Volcano erupting is the baby Celestial waking up for the final act who they fight and Angelina Jolie puts him to sleep & saves the day.......
i hit the thumbs up. send me my money
Isn’t Thanos a deviant?
the volcan is not pompeii as the shot before it shows it on an island and pompeii is not on an island.
I'm glad they dropped a trailer with more details: I do think though that they are holding back something about a main antagonist, it feels like we don't really know Kit's role within the movie version so much yet, and that makes me feel like they are going to set up something bigger for him, namely the Black Knight you were say8ing or some sort of reveal
I know it’s just fiction but it’s kind of bull crap what they say about not meddling in human affairs. Thanks wasn’t human Han they could have stopped him. And if they think so highly of planet earth they could solve the enemy of climate change. Also, I would love to know that the nuke wasn’t a human invention as I think we are too stupid to have it on this planet. I hope to watch the movie without it being annoying. So it’s late in Copenhagen and I’ll stop my rant. Have a sweet day everyone.
I Loced this video and trailer! It finally gave some direction in plot and showed us their abilities. Can't wait to see it!
So far the film has been advertised as a grand spectacle but both trailers look bland and unimaginative. The visuals look worse than in Thor Ragnarok or Guardians trailers.
Looks Dope ! S/O to Jack Kirby for his imagination
marvel makes me want to watch anything even if i don’t know much about it! so excited to see angelina jolie in marvel at last!
This is #5 trending at the time I'm watching it. Congrats man for moving up
Are you going to do a "Heavy Spoilers" for the new Foundation trailer?
Great video series. Love the "Dad" joke sensibility!
who would win hulk or the eternals
Isn't Thanos an Eternal with the Deviant gene? Shouldn't that mean the other Eternals could have interfered in his plan?
My favorite channel
Love that theyre doing the sleeping celestial storyline. And ikaris is 10000% killing ajak
6:26 It IS Arishem according to what info we have.
5:48 That is clearly a Mexican city being attacked by conquistadors...
I love how Marvel has such rich backstories for their characters. It's not all boom, bam, blast and bang. There's emotion to it all.
Looks great!
Twelve minute vid for a movie trailer?! Well then.. I must’ve missed a lot of Easter eggs 😂
So excited for this movie
Isn't Thanos a deviant?
When ever i look at anything marvel i just cry in the inside if my brain cause i keep remembering iron man’s death 😭😭😭😢😢😢😭😭😭😢😢😢😭😭😢😢😢😭😭😭🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
What you think might be Babylon being invaded and burned, has been suggested by others to be Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Triple Alliance/Empire. And the invaders are the Spanish conquistadors. The volcano could be Santorini/Thera, depicting the demise of the Minoans, perhaps?
I imagine that due to that volcano being on an island it is possible that it is Krakatoa
What a great breakdown! Love the tidbit about the nuke and Phastos! I hope Ikaris isn't evil because of love Richard, but you might've just sold me on that..
I love your reviews man!! Paul!
Dropped
Phastos, in the comics, has Thanos kill most of the Eternals so that the remaining few can finally involve themselves in human affairs... I bet he's the one who summons the deviants for the same effect in this movie, not Icarus
pov: you’re here after watching the trailer, not knowing nun going on in said trailer
I say this was a much better trailer than the first one.
Did you notice the O in November? Life and destruction from within (the earth?).
The trailer gave too much. Especially if U know the eternals. Make way for Galactus (or exitar) is all I’m gonna say. Kill a seed n provoke a world destroyer. U can tell they split up - n the deviants end up “good” n tell them their real purpose.
YT SCRUBBING COMMENTS FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON
There is no way Icarus is bad in this movie. We have seen too many shots at various time periods showing him fighting Deviants. Even in the forest.
the Emergence inst the deviants its the EGG THAT IS EARTH HATCHING A NEW CELESTIAL. YIKES!!! Thats why the celestials created the eternals, to guard their giant egg, let the humans greed, lust and power make it grow, and keep the deviants away.
But Thanos is a Deviant, no?
I can’t with the Jon Snow, Rob Stark, and Cersei   I mean Sersi
That changed my mind a bit
I think this movie will be amazing!
the sun is not hot
ikaris is fsho gunna turn evil by the end of this film nd black knight is gonna take his spot on the eternals
Your ramblings are hilarious tho
Thanks for your review of the trailer!  I was sure that the celestial was the Searcher, but I like your explanation.
I am very curious on how this movie with its seeming world spanning plot is going to ignore all the other heroes in the MCU 😆
But Thanos has a Deviant gene sooooo…
i hate the deviants looiks

When i saw the thumbnail, for a second i thought it was homelander.
Ajak in the Eternals comics is very often the antagonist, so that's why she's probably not around in all the present day group scenes
Can't wait for this movie. The 3-tiered Marvel storytelling, Galactic/Global/Personal, as in Eternals & Loki/ Shang-Chi & Falcon and the Winter Soldier/ Spider-Man & WandaVision, is a great approach to widening their storytelling.
I’m new to the mcu but I’ve become obsessed with the franchise. As soon as I saw there was a new externals trailer I ran to the break down
This trailer is sick!
I cant wait to see this movie!!!
Can't wait for this movie. Looks absolutely beautiful!
Now I am anticipating it. Looks potentially very good. And some stuff definitely looks a bit Jack Kirbyish ,so Ya !
Man come on! I subscribed for your dc videos not fucking mcu…. Seems like you’ve just been switching up on the dc fan base to bandwagon onto the mcu popularity… unsubbing dude
that eternal spaceship near the sun scene reminds me of “the black knight” mystery
Nice info Thanks
Trailer has me hyped! Can't wait to watch this.
The last trailer wasn’t really that interesting, but after this I’m now definitely hooked.
is number 8 on trending enough love for you? :)
I can't wait to get COVID while I watch this in theaters!
I feel like this is gonna be one of the better Marvel Movies they come out with .
WOW WOW WOW!!!   Eternals = Anunnaki (the half human half anu hybrid faction that was PRO HUMANITY and wished to free the original human slave race!)   Deviants = Reptilian Draco/ Anunnaki (the original sinister evil faction that allied itself with the Dracos!)  I’m just flabbergasted by how all of THIS will be subconsciously planted and REIGNITED within people’s psyche, on a DNA activation level...  I bet so many in the collective noosphere will be getting past life Memories and regressive REAL human/earth history downloads, watching this, when it comes out!!!   It looks VISUALLY STUNNING & the cast looks STELLAR!!! 🙀🙀🙀🙀   I can’t wait!  Wow! 🔥🕊🙏🏼🧿🌎🌊
What if ‘The Emergence’ event is direct order by the Celestials, within a powerful window of energetic opportunity,   for the ETERNALS to finally intervene with Humanity post-blip AGAIN and like they have done before....help genetically alter/gene splice human DNA into a mutation that would allow X-MEN to emerge...  Out of Humanity’s desparate need for normal everyday HEROES that could defend the Earth...as the threat of the Deviants allied with other BIG BADS from the Multiverse Saga/Kang The Destroyer...etc. is alarmingly and exponentially growing...  BEYOND Humanity’s current ability to stand a chance against them...  Now THAT would be the ULTIMATE SETTING UP of the X-men to become the main team-up of the MCU, after the Avengers moved on or disassembled...  It would make THE ETERNALS...the Spiritual Parents of THE X-MEN...🤓🤓🤓
I thought the trailer was epic, showed a lot of info n answered a lot of questions, also loved video ;)
Thanks for the info!  This series is new-to-me, so I appreciate the insight & predictions.
This trailer is better than the last one
Is anyone hyped about this? No? Didn’t think so
thanos is half devient so isn't there a loophole?
Looks so so so much better than the Shang-chi
I’m super excited for the Eternals cause I know nothing of them and the trailers give us teases without fully exposing the movie
WOW! I DON'T CARE!
Good video. Keep it up. This movie looks great.
Didn't have much frame of reference for who the Eternals are. I feel like this trailer does a good job of setting expectations for the movie in general.
It's funny, I've been really excited about this for a long time now, but my friend (that is a Huge Marvel fan) couldn't really care less about it. Until this morning that is! He saw it and woke me up telling my how good it looks and now he's super stoked for it!
I'm willing to bet most if not all of the deviant scenes are in the past. The asteroid is thousands of years ago when the celestials planted an egg on earth (coz that's what they do), the energy from the blip has kick started it and now they have 7 days before it hatches.
We were told not to interfere.”  “By who?” . . .     Kevin Feigie
Paul needs to get on some AppleTv stuff. Foundation looks like it'll be amazing (a new, cool trailer for that dropped today) and I recently fell in love with For All Mankind and Mystic Quest. I would love some For All Mankind breakdowns for when season 3 comes out, but alas that won't be for another year... but the property I am REALLY looking forward to in the future on AppleTv is the Wool adaptation (books: Wool/Silo series by Hugh Howey [Wool, Shift, Dust]).
I dont think that was a tsunami, it look more like the earth was descending into the water like it was being sucked in, like a giant whirlpool.
I can’t wait!
good videos
I am so looking forward to the eternals.
Getting really excited. Interesting casting choices. Love the diversity I've been waiting for. I always have so much comic book reading to catch up on.
Do you think Wanda or Doctor Strange the Sorcerer supreme are at the same power level as the Eternals if not stronger ? Would be an interesting match up if they fought which I know they wouldn't do lol
clealy thats not a celestial but golb duh
Your video's keeps getting better and better
That there would be Arashem the Judge
I’ve always love the Marvels comics & movies, unfortunately I’ve never heard of the Eternals. But this trailer definitely has me intrigued ❤️ Thank you so much for your work on all the “Easter Eggs” it’ll help me clue in better to understand the timeline with the other Marvel movies.😘
People made threats towards you over a theory 😭
r u going to make videos about Star Wars Visions?
I loved this trailer for answering some questions. I look beautiful and I think it's gonna be the best MCU movie!
Great breakdown as always. Thanks!
That "guy with Kingo is VERY important in the comics.
This trailer looks solid. Can’t wait. Great break down.
Oh boy been pumped about this since I heard it was coming
I think the green stuff when she says when you love somthing you protect it, is the same green stuff of what if ep 2, the one that gives life and plants? idk just a theory
Sorry I'm confused isn't that actor the one that played bucky ?? Lol
We got homelander in the mcu now
Well well well so being a victim of a Thanos dusting wasn't random at all, it was all those selfish people that didn't up vote Emergency Awesome.
I feel like we all should be excited about this movie but people are weird
They don't interfere with humanity, just like Uatu, right? RIGHT? *sweats uncontrollably"
The way Ikaris is firing his eye lasers almost looks like he doesn't have control over it. Reminds me of Cyclops whenever his glasses are blown off or destroyed.
Avengers should have left everything alone, and not go after Thanos
The movie I look forward to the most!
Lol @ the Ikea pump fake 😄😄😄
I think this could be one of the best additions to the MCU. I think this film will be game-changing.
They finally made a good trailer!!! I actually am less worried now
What IF?  I win
Origin is bit different. Hmmmm I wonder how they will do mutations.
The actor playing druig is 28 going on 45. Lol I can't be the only one who thinks he looks way older then 28
Good call on the Icarus theory! Thank you
The trailer was great & the movie looks gorgeous. I'm just a little disappointed they revealed some of the answers we were all wondering. I think they should've let everyone wonder & discover it when we saw the movie. For me, at least, it took away some of the anticipation and excitement to find out those answers. Still going to go see it when it comes out.
Hello Paul. I’m from IKEA, and were interested in sponsoring you. We just need some information. Mother’s maiden name, first pet…
Kingo's cameraman is actually played by the Bollywood actor Harish Patel
Jon Snow & Robb Stark compete for Cersei's love. lol
This trailer is Fire n has me hyped even more than Shang chi
Did the bus driver turn into rose petals too??? 😱😱😱
Well from the comics Eternals can’t be killed. So I doubt Ajak is dead unless they changed it for the film
No Way, Homie!
0:06 lol. He put the thumbnail in of a Screen Culture trailer.
I've been looking forward to this ever since the first trailer.
Was expecting a ten things you missed from trailer video
They’re machines? I thought they were humans but given powers and immortality.
Still not interested 😒  Love your videos but this is one of those movies that hasn't captured my attention.
Bungie approves of all the sevens.
It's the return of the Stark boys!
There will always be some form of reaching in creating these types of video’s especially with the MCU but this was pretty good still. Tbh I’m looking forward to this one more than the Shang-Chi film.
Best marvel move breakdown channel
I hope Salma Hayek gets a lot of screen time. Love her.
Hilarious intro! Leaving a like just for that.
I hope ikaris doesn't kill Ajax.  I think the  leader of the deviants (maybe Kro) will kill her, IF she even dies. Maybe Kro shifted into Ikaris.
God created everything in six days, not seven.
Wait if they could only step in and help against deviants why didn't they stop Thanos then since he has a deviant gene? Makes no sense
This trailer is MUCH better, but I still am not super excited about this one. They seem way too overpowered and it looks to me that they must just "forget" they have super powers every once and awhile. The reason they didn't help the Avengers against Thanos is SOOOOO STUPID! If that sort of logic is going to be explaining away the plot holes this is going to be another of the "watch once in theaters and never again" movies instead of the "go back several times to the theater and then buy the blu-ray" level of my favorite MCU movies.
While I thank you for some insight into the Celestials, I just want to point out that the whole “They stick to certain colours” thing, in regards to who is who, may not be correct… since they changed all the colours of the Infinity Stones/Gems around for the MCU. It may be the same here. As for the chestpiece of the Celestial we see in this trailer, it may be they adjusted the design since they showed it in GotG… or they forgot to add the chest detail in. It might be less of a case of looking at colours or body design, and to instead look at their “faces”, since all the Celestials have unique looking “face” designs to their helmets.
I don't think the volcano connection was a reach. It might not be a Thing, but it's entirely reasonable to assume that prominent scenes in two shows, featuring volcanos, are related.   And thanks for pointing out some details I missed on first watch.
I think it's Druig at 6:10, not Ikaris
Wait isn’t thanos a hybrid of a titan and a deviant? Seems like marvel writing themselves into a hole with the big “where were they during thanos” question. If he’s a deviant they should’ve been able to 1,2,3 Ray rice thanos
Nice to know locations were mostly real in this one.
Wow this is may be the most boring MCU movie yet ( or maybe it's my medication 🤣🤤)
Marvel can come up with great story arcs, but the overarching Heroes vs Villains on an ever increasing scale is just tired, old and becoming ridiculous.   I expect to eventually find out that Crowley and Aziraphale are behind the whole MCU.
Correction: It’s not the deviants that feed off human energy, it’s the celestial (egg) growing inside the planet.
So how does an android love triangle work? Seems like a bug in the programming to me. 😀
I’m excited to see where this film will take the MCU. I get the feeling they will introduce the Eternals now and it will definitely not be the end of it. We will probably see them throughout the next MCU films and see them reunite again in present day for something much bigger. Just a thought.
They didn't turn up to fight Thanos - But Thanos is a deviant ??
Ikaris thought posing as a music producer and having sex with Elton John was more important than stopping Thanos
Hope eternals turn out to be the surprise package out of the incredible projects coming out in the last few months of this year!
Eternals trailer. It like poetr…. Dayum
There could be alot of video manipulation like with civil war but I don't think that is Zhao's style
Hopefully this isn't like Fox's X-Men...A bunch of well known actors but a boring/unnecessary synopsis. I wish they introduced them in other movies first for Phase 4-5
I want to think Loki will have an appearance somehow
I’m thinking Druig will manipulate Ikaris is someway. 🤷🏾‍♂️
What if that shape shifting deviant leader shape shifted to Icaris and killed Ajax? Would make for an interesting twist
I'm so excited for the Bollywood scene!!!
For the Algorithm!
Did you notice that arishem the judge looks alot like the barkeep in episode 2 of What if? Which also looks like a barkeep in Ragnarok?
Good trailer. I agree with you.
I hope the movie is good, but this is the 1st Marvel trailer in a while that I flat out do not like. -> Pretty movie stars vs. CG monsters. -> Plot is like: “I can explain” - yeah but not really, explanations are silly.
Why didnt you guys interfere?  Shows Celestial  Understandable, have a nice day 👍🏾
jeeez. can't wait to see this movie.
I hit like as soon as I could so you didnt snap me out of existence. You wouldn't do that to a fellow Paul.....or would you??
I think that deviant was kro
Great video
I am sooo exicted to the eternals
Has anyone in the MCU said Thanos is a deviant?
Paul can you look into something. I’ve seen a sideways hourglass in 3 of Marvels latest offerings. It was shown a lot in LOKI, is in the advert for, and on her tombstone in Black Widow and I’ve just noticed in the final scene of The Eternals latest... Any ideas?
My gosh the visuals are mindblowing
I think that snap to bring people back, maybe gave some powers to random people. And maybe thats how we get our X-MEN
Love the trailer, not sure about the Deviants though. Pity they weren’t more “Kirbyesque”
To clear up a few things: Before our universe there was another one, the first one called (The first firmament) This living universe was lonely and created beings to worship it called "Aspirants" among these black and red aspirants were multi colored ones as well called Celestial's. The Celestial's wanted their independence from their creator so a war broke out which caused major deaths on both side. the first firmament fled to the deepest void possible to escape while the Celestial's war with the aspirants caused the birth of our universe. They came in and floated around for a while before creating life. Celestial's also created the Cree, Skrull's, Deviant's, Eternal's and human's. They are essentially the gods of all life in the Marvel universe. They also placed the X gene within ancient humanity so that we could potentially posses powers aka the Mutant Gene from X-men.
The trailer looks good. I'm wondering if this film will introduce the concept of human mutation?
Don't know if someone in the comments but the volcano might be krakatoa.
Vin Diesel: family Also Vin Diesel: I'm groot.
I like that Grand Order screenshot ;)
you know whats really messed up? Thanos is actually a deviant, not a titan! where were you eternals!
When collector asked if you don't shoot laser out of your eyes or fly in 2nd episode of what if  that was actually the Easter egg about one of the eternals not of Superman as we thought..
I don’t know. The concept seems reductive.  And I already think Marvel’s Cosmic side is weak Sci Fi.  Too human Centric, not imaginative enough.  All aliens look like pretty human movie stars. I dunno. Not impressed yet.  I agree with your theory that Rob Stark is bad and John Snow is good.
The tremors in the ocean mentioned in endgame!!! Everyone assumed it wss Namor but its the eternals! You can see the light hit the ocean and the massive waves and tremors in the trailer
I don’t know why people are so skeptical about this movie, it looks fantastic already
Lol did the door ever get fix
Can't wait for this to hit the cinemas!
Android love includes no genetic deviations, tears for self-made errors, ambiguity in gender, and relies on empathy to defend its will to rebel. 'If you love something you protect it', is covetous not love, as that which you protect harbors your prides. This movie reeks of arrogance and ego, vanity and bitterness, flamboyance, self assurance, self pity, rebellion and lawlessness. Can't wait to see it.
I think another little slice of evidence that you may be right about your advanced AI theory, is that some of them didn't get snapped by Thanos, who only snapped "living" beings out of existence.
Way better then the first trailer 👍
great video. the previous trailers were a bit meh, but this one has me hyped! I disagree with your theory around Ikaris being the bad guy (would be a pretty good twist). The scene where he is shooting lasers from his eyes outside the cabin where he was speaking to Ajak, he looks pretty distraught. It could be a scene where actually Ajak is killed by a deviant, setting up a section where Ikaris gets the band back together, using Ajak's death as a trigger. I also think that Ajak doesn't really die, but she remains as a spiritual guide to the Eternals, maybe coming back towards the end in the final battle...
The subtitles for the official final trailer say ‚KRO‘ in the scene with thena, so maybe Kronos or some other character doh, no celestial I think
Okay but if Thanos was a deviant shouldn't the Eternals have interfered 🤔
Was is part of "he who remains" plan to let the eternals too, does "he who remains" control the eternals ? as in they going according to his plan
ur lows are so fraking high! WTF
im so pumped for this movie
This is now my most anticipated MCU film. And right behind Dune overall. This Looks amazing. 🤞🏻
I don't know anything about the Eternals but I will be watching it 😁
1:30 mark... that mushroom cloud looks like a 7 as well.  Happy accident? or intentional?
The main deviant is kro the warlord it says so in the closed captions
I like it but man did they make it complicated for people that dont know Marvel. Aka my Wife or her sister. The are going to ask me 1 million questions.
if you got to 8:02 and watch the volcano something is happening on the right side ? (maybe lightening or energy from an eternal ? maybe a eternal whip?) it’s yellow !! maybe one of them caused it ?
They try to explain they can’t interfere with human affairs unless the deviants attacks.  Well, isn’t Thanos like the master of the deviants???  And what Thanos was doing affects not just humans but the entire multiverse so wouldn’t that be important enough for them to get involved?
Man, Marvel sure knows how to keep their fans intrigued. I can already tell this will be one of my favorite Marvel movies.
It I remember correctly, there is a Celestial "gestating" in Earth, which they do across countless other worlds, and when it "births" it destroys the planet. The energy Ajak speaks of has accelerated this coming Celestial, which I think is what we see with the Eternals standing around it, and hence that cosmic energy has left the world just 7 days before it is "born". All this assumes they're following the comics storyline.
I'm more excited for shanghai chi and eternals than I am spiderman
Isn't Thanos a deviant?? 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️... Just Saiyan
Wow, this movies looks amazing. I know peeps are fiendishly waiting for a 🕷NWH🕸 trailer to drop. But I’m so looking forward to finally getting to watch the Shang-Chi and Eternals movies. I love me some Spider-Man, but I’m ready for some new characters up in this piece.  ☮️
Your idea about the creation and destruction of the world in the bible is scientifically wrong but Quran states it perfectly.
Don't forget there are things that will be added or removed from the actual movie that was in the trailers. Sneaky Feige...!
me me me me me me I want to win. I MUST WIN.   great video
Wasn’t Thanos also a deviant tho? Why didn’t they help stop him?
Aww, no Ikea sponsorship? 'I'll never be THAT big...' not with THAT attitude you won't mister!
25 Shang chi featurettes tbh lmaooo
I liked Black Widow and Shang Chi looks fun but this is the first Phase Four movie that looks like serious business. I'm cautiously excited.
Why wouldn’t the internals interfere with Thanos if He has the deviant jean
Exciting movie
Volcano = Krakatoa
This looks pretty good. I can't wait.... however I need the spider man trailer!
so hyped for this movie. really excited to see chloe zhaos work
I GOT A THEORY LIKE SO MORE PEOPLE SEE THIS So in the trailer ikarus shoots beams which people think  ikarus kills ajac but maybe its marvel trickings us Or Maybe a Deviant Finds them and kills Ajac and ikarus kills the deviant and lies by her body And then Ikarus Goes to find the other eternals to kill the deviants and he goes 1 by 1 findign them and the war begins      My theory could be wrong and if I got something spelled wrong my bad
Can someone explain to me where was the eternals at when thanos was destroying the world ?
Could the "power orb" powering up an eternal = soul?
Awesome 👌🏼
We are all just biological machines.
Definitely going to have a lot of twist and turns, probably will watch just on cinematography alone.
For MCU sake, the plot could have been designed in a way that the eternals receive/earn their powers only when the deviants show up! Similar to a hunter getting the tool at the right time to hunt a predator!
It's gonna be a massacre
The MoS like action scenes from Icarus look amazing. I’ve been wanting something like this in the MCU for forever. Give us a Sentry movie next!!!
I want this to be good, I want to be wrong. But man, this looks dull. Kirbys art was vibrant. This looks like Twighlight with the Stark boys and Selma Hayek. So drab. To many scenes at dinner tables.
My Theory is Phastos set up the Wakandan Technology!!! BOOM!!!
Marvel is just zooming OUT on the universe multiscale. Correction: MULTIVERSE
I TOTALLY THOUGHT THAT WAS GALACTUS!
gotta say this trailer actually made me much more excited for this one...looks pretty visually stunning.
I watch you every time you come out
A must see movie
Who’s not excited about this movie!? I’m confused…
Did you do a "fax, no printer" but with "family, no Vin Diesel?!"
looks interesting for sure!
I really love how big of a part Steve Rogers and tony stark played in the MCU and the best part is that they have no idea! They have literal eternals speaking their names as if they were eternals themselves!! Awesome!!!!!
I got a d in geography so I don't know hahahah well I got an A in geography and I still don't know
At 10:04 the Deviant could be Kro, who has a romantic relationship with Thena, and when she talks about "loving and protecting", maybe she's referring to her love for him.
Them being machines may explain why none of them were snapped.
This movie still looks great
Can’t wait to see this movie! Been waiting a long time!
Oh good, it's only Crandon, as long as it isn't Croydon or Aberdeen.
I am very excited for this movie. I have been wanting to see another Celestial on screen
ikarus looks like homelander!
Bruh, this shit looks littttttt.... Somebody had ether coming out of their hands bruh.... superman eye beams.... celestials....answers to questions....visually stunning..... I fucking love this trailer💎💯
In such a rush to make the first video you skipped over the fact that the yellow shiny thing Cersei was about to touch is the same thing Nebula was talking about in the (what if) series last night...... key reason why they waited til now to drop the trailer so you can know what your looking at.....
Everyone’s saying ikarus is gonna be bad but I think he’s just gonna be a strict leader type that’s just mostly serious and rarely jokes and maybe almost turns bad or makes some bad choices but all and all is good and fights for what’s right 🤷🏼
How hilarious would it be if they meet a Celestial... ... And it collapses down like it's a mega iron man suit, to reveal an actual person (albiet celestial) stepping out. Like, I got that image in my head when I thought about how they got instructions from them, idk why but I envision that they speak all languages. Eithet that, or they make bioshock underwater metal groan sounds.
I GOT'S THE BUTT SWEAT'S :(
It mephisto
I got a reverse theory... Kevin Feige recently said that he hates killing off properties so I got the reverse... I think no one dies ... but Ajax you don't see in present day cause ... she is the villain... and Icarus saves the day and let's go his love for the one he loves but he doesn't die either... I don't think their going to kill any characters.
Don't let this trailer breakdown distract you from the fact that Fresh & Fit's official name change is *Twin Sisters*
I am soooooo much more excited about Eternals than Spider-Man
Could you imagine if the Bible was anything else? Like, imagine if the Bible was Harry Potter, Paul would be like, "they went to a hut with no stairs on South America, which is juxtaposed to Hogwarts, from the Bible"
I’m so excited for this film! It looks so awesome! Loved this trailer! 🙌😁 can’t wait to see this movie!
Thanks to this trailer I'm hooked on this movie and want to know more about the characters.
I do want things Runed, I like Runes, Rune me all over lol. Just don't ruin the Runeing.
If Icarus is evil, then it makes the scene where they laugh at him for saying he can lead the Avengers even funnier. And Icarus has to fly into the sun and die at the end right?
My question would be when those deviants arrive... Wouldnt Dr. Strange and the rest of them go to fight them also??
2:42 did you just say FAMILYYYYYY
Hahaha I love when Reach Richards shows up with these crazy theories 😆
Awesome stuff
I dont think they're machines after the trailer that doesn't make sense
Dont think thats a nuke explosion! Thats a Volcanic Eruption!
What is the theory on what was happening to Angelina Jolie’s character when she’s held up by the deviant? Her eyes turned white and that makes me feel scared about what might become of her
The ship didn't melt that close to the sun which is surprising since it looked like a kit-kat..
bad ass
Cool
I am very excited about this movie Eternals.
good to see Kit
Great trailer, can't wait to watch the movie.
I cant wait to see it and I'm excited for phase 4. However, I feel like this almost creates an issue with Thor. If Thors Family held 9 realms in the universe wouldn't the Eternals presence be trespassing?? I feel like they would have to already know they were there. I hope this doesn't create continuity issues, because Thor and Family are also Thousands of years old so you can't just gloss over that but sadly I feel like they may not even address it.
What was that gold whip like spark in the volcano slow motion shot
If man is 5, then the devil is 6, and god is 7…….
My brother & I are old school Marvel brats. We love it and have greatly enjoyed what the MCU has brought from the comic page to the silver screen. It’s a dream come true, and we’re grateful to be around to see it.   With that said, I’m having trouble getting excited about this installment in the franchise. Admittedly, I wasn’t a big Eternals follower. So, I don’t know a lot about their background. I understand that absolutely plays a factor in my perspective.  But one thing that’s really bothering me is the trending direction of retconning as new characters make their way to the theaters. In this trailer, what bothers me is, essentially, the negative spin placed upon the Restoration Snap. I understand that writers are floating out the concept that “everything has consequences,” but using that as a point to “activate” the Deviants is a big stretch to me; just silly, really.  I think my biggest concern, though, is one that thousands of others share also: I don’t want to see Hollywood executives screw up great characters and stories with their own personal and political agendas. At first glance, the new universe seems to be shaping itself around some of these things. Great characters and their stories are now being retconned to ferry out to the masses some social message that big wigs want to drive across, instead of just doing the old business of creating fascinating characters and stories and sharing them with the world. Know what I mean?  In the end, I just want to see the Marvel I grew up with continue to inspire, amaze, and thrill fans with the magic of a great story — not anyone’s politics or social messaging.
I need to see the celestials interact with galactus
What looks like an asteroid hitting earth is actually a celestial egg planted by the Celestials, which will hatch in seven days and destroy the planet and everything living on it.
Wut
MCU Wiki for Arishem uses the Celestial from this trailer as the profile pic. Eson the Searcher's profile pic is from GOTG. I'm not sure how official or reliable the MCU Wiki is, however.
Do they know about alternate time lines!? They are told not to interfere but now we got the multi verse
Brilliant video 😀
ikaris= homelander vibes???
OMG, I think I’m more excited than a kid at Christmas. Can’t wait!!!
9:15 colours of magic in the mcu is not that kinda system.
I really appreciate this  Trailer being that we haven't had anything in a very long time
You didn’t upset woke up to a breakdown an the intro made me spit up my cereal cause “I understood that reference” 😂😂😂😂😂
Any of y’all know when this movie takes place chronologically like after endgame obviously but like a date?
I'm curious to see if the Guardians of the Galaxy get tied in somehow, as they had the first mention of a Celestial at the Collectors place, not to mention Ego. It'd be cool if there was a tease of Adam Warlock intervening, maybe in the post-credits to setup Volume 3. Could be too early for that, but the direct tie-in seems like a good setup!
Assuming that they’re changing Thanos from having the deviant gene because then technically… they could’ve fought Thanos… kinda confusing lol
Bring definition baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaak
New Rockstar
You have a theory? The big leak says he's the bad guy, did you come up with that before the leak?
We came to earth 7thousand years ago, created by Jesus’s Powerful Word of Command.   Jesus told us to stay and watch over the humans.  Now it all begins again!!!   Demons are resurfacing by humanity’s evil acts and thoughts, when population reappeared when Thanos lost!  Miss guided by Devil and his demons, humans are nearing extinction again! Find Jesus, demons are coming!!! Find Jesus, before it’s too Late!!!
I am so Excited to see that smug Druig. Gives off such a Loki vibes.
I don't understand how anybody could doubt this movie. All the powers and magic the celestials!! There is so much stuff in this movie that I am excited for and have been waiting for for a very long time
That box set is beautiful! I have read the plot leaks and this trailer pretty much confirms them. Looking forward to seeing it on the big screen!
Can we see a fan theory of why we don't have a no way home trailer yet?  Just saying that would be fun with all of the delays from the spidey verse.
It would have been hilarious if half of everyone on the planet unsubscribed from everyone on the day infinity war was released and than resubscribed when Endgame came out  it would creep me out abit though
trailer was great.  thanks for breaking it down and giving some detail.  actually looking forward to this movie now.
Arishem the Judge & Nezarr the Calculator 🔥🔥🔥 Edit: I think the emerald one is Nezarr the Calculator
Eternals invent everything but are not allowed to interview humanity.  I am confused.  Eliminating half the life in the universe and, never mind.  I am not sure I can go on this ride.
This looks dope AF!
So possibly, a celestial emerges from the volcano eruption and hence the final battle. Overall, my family and I are excited to see this on the big screen!
I'm getting Jupiter's Legacy vibes from this.
This is next level. And from what we are hearing about Shang-Chi. That too. Marvel has stepped up its game. I can't want for Galactus.
The D was never for Definition, it was for Deviant! I am onto you “friendly“ neighborhood spoiler man
Thought the big bad will be kro?
please let me win..haha
So Heimdall and odin knew about these guys?!🤔
MCU: May I present you brand new superhero team movie DCEU: May I present you yet another Batman movie
That Celestial was so horrifying it was almost beautiful. Chills!
The volcano isn’t Mount Vesuvius because that’s on mainland Italy not an island.
The Celestial is Arishem…there’s a Lego set coming with that Celestial called “In Arishem’s Shadow”. You nailed another prediction!
Well done Marvel. A new adventure begins.
What in the Evangelion is this
I posted a twitter link of Newrockstar's twitter of panic ... did it got automatically deleted ?
the trailer looks pretty interesting. Dunno how they're going to fit all this in one movie.
Ikaris has graphically similar eye beam as Homelander
I can't wait to see eternals, some ppl think it's gonna be wack but I bet it's gonna be a sleeper an turn out to be one of the best marvel movies ever
No Vin Diesel?!?!
Excellent breakdown. I'm interested in seeing the film. The trailer is pretty good.
The deviants live underground. Hence “the emergence”. They were created on earth by the celestials. They’re monsters. They don’t go from planet to planet.
Am I the only one who loves the direction they’re taking the MCU?
They messed it up for X-Men no more Cyclops. Eyes out the laser beam will be played out when the X-Men comes out
Wow
If u dont want anything rooned😂😂nice stewie refference
Really had little interest in this film originally but the more trailers I see, the more I want to see it when it releases
This is gonna be one of the biggest marvel movies
What if the underwater quakes Okoye mentions in Endgame and the tsunamis caused by the deviants are linked?
I must admit when he broke that table I laughed. Personally I approve at where he bought that, it means he can easily replace it now if only someone could tell that idiot to stop breaking his furniture!
This phase is more about Magic rather than the previous phase which was more about Technology
This trailer looks awesome! I wasn't hyped before but now I am!
Thanks for the breakdown, when I saw this trailer I just kept asking questions   Who are eternals, what is eternals and why is eternals!
I get them only being able to jump in when deviants are involved…but…Thanos is a deviant right ?
Look like Spaniard soldiers and Mayan pyramids
Heard from "dude bro, trust me" that end credits have thanos son starfox played the downtown Abbey guy.
Can't wait!
If the eternals weren't allowed to get involved in other affairs and were only involved in deviant problems how come they didn't get involved with thanos who is a half deviant?
Pretty hyped about this movie. Can't wait for its release
That's pretty deep if he is the bad of the movie.
Isn’t thanos a deviant? Or am I as wrong as Paul usually is.
I kinda dig the lack of spidey trailer. Gives more showtime for these lesser known titles.
You're gonna cast Salma Hayek only to have her in a few flash back moments. That seems a bit wasted. All though these are the same cluckers that cast Olga Kurylenko in Black Widow and gave her a single line which was some dumb fuck shit. Either way I'm looking forward to both Shang-Chi and Eternals.
Cersei seems to have reality stone like powers
Dude, love your videos and all the bad jokes XD
"I got a D on geography" 😅😅😅
I wonder if the nuke is also the reason Phastos never helps us with an further weapon inventions... perhaps the film will show a few examples of lessons they each learn throughout the 7000 years to hammer home the 'Prime Directive' - yes I'm a Star Trek fan...
Where’s that spider man trailer?🤔
The trailer has me excited for the new phase of Marvel. They are in full promotion mode since releasing Black Widow.
nice and detailed explanation about the 2nd trailer of ETERNAL hope to see more breakdowns about the MCU..
Lol, love the added touch of showing a clip from THE UNTOUCHABLES when mentioning people said you were wrong and were gonna murder you and you'd family 🤣
Great thoughts! I like your style
There's already a flaw......when ask why THEY(The Eternals) did not help fight against Thanos....THEY answers they can't interfere with human conflicts unless Deviants are involve......WELL! Thanos is an Eternal infected with a Deviant syndrome gene...therefore Thanos is a Deviant! THEREFORE! YES! The Eternal should've responded to Thanos! big mistake!
That was fast
Technically Thanos is an eternal with a deviant Gene, that would mean that he's technically a deviant and a threat so the celestials were wrong.
I can't wait to see how many people bring up the one Eternal using energy eye blasts.  Can't wait to see how many people think he's Cyclops ancestor
I think they may have revealed too much in this trailer but it did lead to new questions. I look forward to it.
I love the Icarus theory!!
They sell now they are millionaires and still can be billionaires in futures. He went from trillion tokens to billions
I love your humor in these lol. At least 1 audible chuckle per vid.
The world : THanos  Salma Hayek : TANos
So if u have a trillion tokens and it hits a penny then u ahve trillion why u need a trillion dollars
Still eternally wondering when Mephisto will get a confirmation and appearance. Could he be a Deviant?
Lightning speed brother...well done  👏👏👏👏👏😁🤣
Unless deciants are invovled. Isn’t thanos a deviant??
This may just be a blockbuster. We shall see.
nice one
Why is ikarus giving Homelander vibes...the blue color, the laser from eyes...
Not gonna lie .... I really liked the trailer
Cheeky
That's not a nuke.....it's the unimind
We want NO WAY HOME TRAILER so badly now 😭😭
It's like FAMLEE. Vin Diesel: Did someone say Faml... Everyone: Not you Fam.
I just started watching recently but I love the work and have been watching every video since
🙌✅
I'm really excited for this movie. The cast. The theme. And it looks beautiful. I'm glad marvel can do something different once in a while.
Do you think all the mutants we see in the future will be young versions of X-men since mutants didn’t exist or will they be older adults already barely getting their powers
Maybe Icarus got snapped and Cerci moved on with Whitman (idk if anything is spelled right)
The Emergence sounds more like a Celestial is about to be born.  Also, wouldn’t it work better that Ajax was taken out by a Deviant attack?
YouTube knows what's up having this video as the first suggested video under the official trailer
too much superman here.
Trailer looked alright. It really do be giving superman vibes tho
When do you get time to edit these videos ?
Also the Lego Leaks said Arishem so...
exposition dump as trailer
Can't wait for this
I  can't wait to see the whole story.
The trailer was awesome.  Super excited!
So is thanos not a diviant hybrid then,
I thought a deviant killed Ajak which is why Ikaris is so angry. But woa...him turning is interesting.
those are the gates of Ishtar 5:48 confirming its Babylon
Them: "We have a deviant" Eternals: "We have a superman"
really lived this trailer nwh trailer soon? hopefully
Yes! I’m calling it too; Icarus is the bad guy. He’s putting off bad vibes. They want us to think Druig is the issue but I don’t.
I liked this trailer a lot!
Paul dropping trailers and helping rivals all in a good morning's work
Watched the trailer twice with my daughters before coming here. I am so ready for this and can't wait to see it in theaters. Here's to hoping theaters don't close up around me before The Eternals is out.
SPOLIER ALERT. i forget the names but the charcter angelina plays in the movie is actually in love with a deviant so it may be the king deviant telling her that she cant protect them and to pick a side.. i think this will be a big plot twist
Wasn’t thanos a deviant though? I mean he was born to eternals in the comics but because of his “defected” genes, wasn’t he a deviant in the comics??
Oi!
I'm excited for this movie 😁
Not hyped but definitely curious
I’ve a question if they are only to interfere if deviants are involved then why did they not stop the avengers from snapping and bringing everyone back? they would’ve known that that brings back the deviants…???
You nailed it bro
I have the feeling this movie is going to be like Guardians of the Galaxy. Nobody asked for it or knew about the characters. However, it does look way more serious in tone.
I mean, just the fact of having Angelina Jolie in this movie is the absolute world. Plus, what kind of deviant can outpower an Eternal like that?!?! I just can't wait for this!!!
I think you're reaching quite fervently. Around...
‘Why didn’t you guys help fight Thanos?”  Eternals: His chin makes us uncomfortable.
Scarlet witch has cosmic based powers and they aren't golden.   Where do you get this stuff
i thought that was galactus.... i'm crying
Sooo Druig looks like the bad guy but Ikaris will be a plot-twist bad guy? Interesting, might be. I would have guessed Thena but also this movie is directed by Chloe Zhao and I don't know really what to expect.
YOO THIS MOVIE IS GONNA SLAP UGGGHHH
Cersai turned all them people in that bus to flowers bruh
No no    Icarus won’t kill eternals   It’s likely the deviants which lines up with the comics    The thena thing…..weeelll
sad to see ajak leaves so early 😭😭 i like salma alottt
Soooo if they're supposed to just take care of deviants and ignore the Snap... why did they ignore Thanos when he is, in fact, a deviant himself? Is it because he's eternal-deviant? So he was hands off? lol
I am deeply disturbed by the lack of puns and specific instances of highlighted "poetry"  Just kidding!  Bruce Bann"t"er kills it in every video.
This breakdown made me wanna watch the move every more. This has almost as excited as End Game!
“Why didn’t you help fight Thanos?” “We were instructed not to interfere unless deviants were involved.” Thanos born with deviant gene…
I'd love to see this movie after I watch the Marvel's box set that I Hope I win a copy of.
Good video thanks
I have been a Marvel fan (on and off) for 35 years...although I never got into The Eternals...I was more an X-Men/New Mutants/X-Force reader that occasionally strayed into other titles (mainly thanks to Secret Wars 1 and 2).  This movie looks AMAZING to me...FAR more interesting than Shang-Chi, at least to me...and the battles and effects look a TON better as well!  (Shang-Chi looks like of cheesy to me, with the battle at the temple being a perfect example of this...I hope that movie proves me wrong, but it just doesn't feel epic...it feels forced, at least from the trailers).  THIS looks epic!
Eternals is looking great! Loving where the MCU is going!
What if the deviants came to earth on that asteroid?!
This trailer was very Asia and Europe friendly. I was a bit shocked, but also looking at the cast totally understandable.
the part where you say is possibly Babylon is actually the Aztec Empire as you can clearly see aztec step pyramids and the warrior on horseback that was striking someone down was dressed in conquistor armor. It is not babylon as babylon is from an era BEFORE Horses was domesticated for riding. BUT the scene AFTER the horseman is Babylon or Sumeria though as you can tell by the blue and gold wall murals of the gates of Babylon.
But for what I know Thanos is also a deviant, maybe not in the MCU
“2:40 …it’s like family, it rhymes.”
Just seeing the Celestials Made my Day!!!
Man's so Fast Quicksilver Didn't see that coming
Knull is coming.
The celestials are the enemy  along with the deviants.   They're not robots and they're attempting to save earth from the celestial host
Rob stark and john snow fight over who gets to band Cersei
The hype train keeps rising for Shang Chi then Marvel Studios drops a new Eternal trailer and all I could say is, “Okay Marvel, I’m giving you all my money!!!!!!” 😂😂
The trailer is good but this is not the movie I’m looking forward to. Spider-Man  No Way Home is the trailer we need. I feel like this movie is a filler.
Meh. This is the first Marvel movie that I am going to skip. Sorry, just can't take Angelina Jolie's crappy "accent" and acting. I hope that it ends up being decent for everyone that's looking forward to it, but, it isn't looking good.
Eternals is gonna ruin the mcu man I want street level mcu I don’t want this cosmic shite
You missed out Ajak there consoling Phastos. And what of the six eyes of the talking deviant being very similar to the Phalanx look? I bet they also leave out that Thanos is a mutant eternal.
Great video. I needed this to be explained. I didn’t realize they had powers like Superman, but way stronger and powerful. I’ve never heard of the Eternals before these trailers.
Technically thanks had a deviant gene….
The excitement keeps piling up
If Ikaris is bad I'm not watching it nope
I know nothing about the Eternals but I'm excited for the film.
2nd trailer must better than the first.
So basically the externals are human decoy like Ego was in Guardians of the galaxy 2. That makes sense and I like it the call back to it. Cool that explains why they lived for so long and look the same. The trailer explanation explains more things that I’ve been asking i honestly can’t wait to see it so that they can answer questions we have.
nice job!
Me: can we have the no way home trailer now? Marvel/sony: best i can do is a second eternal and second carnage trailer
Ty sir 1st review I see
I am fast
Lots of likes. Well deserved.
Love it and thank you
Wait.... doesn't Thanos have the deviant gene. Doesn't he count as what they're allowed to fight?
How doesn’t Thanos count as a Deviant threat?
This and DS2 I literally can't wait for. I think you're probably right about Ikaris too but there will be a throw off twist somewhere.
Looks stunning, hope the story is as good as the cinematography
Wtf is this a fucking rerun of friends as marvels powerful beings I’m already laughing
Too much of your emotion on this video. 🤮
The video i've been waiting for!
Awesome trailer and I can't wait the movie
I can’t wait 2 c this movie! I don’t Madden is going to kill Selma I think the deviant leader is
The man accompanying Kumail's character is Harish Patel. He is famous for portraying villanous roles in Bollywood films and has worked in American TV shows as well.
Now new question where were the Avengers during this fight. 😅
So hyped
The special effects look so natural, it makes everything feel so epic
I can't wait to finally see phase 4
The volcano may be the Krakatoa?
I think it's worth mentioning here how Marvel like to use alternate takes for trailers so some of this will undoubtedly not be the same when the movie actually drops. enough to change story elements, maybe not, but certainly enough to keep theorists guessing to opening day.
You’re only reaching because I can hear your brain cells trying to figure out how Mephisto is part of the movie. Lol.
Kinda worried these characters might be a bit obscure for mainstream (non-comic-nerd) audiences...
Dude, how do you make these videos so fast? are you The Al G Rythm.... ?
What about thanos he's a deviant
Not sure how I feel about this movie
Been did all that lol. Yayyyyy what if?
Homelander vibes on that thumbnail
Isn't thanos a deviant descendant?
Hi Paul, Ive noticed how fast your spoilers/reviews come out, can you enjoy a film whilst reviewing it?
You can be that big and more lol
Yeah but NOONE theorized the eternals were simply ..instructed not to intefere in human conflict! But we we wont here about that
The intro is me.
I don't think Ikaris killed Ajax. I think they were ambushed by enemies, deviants maybe. Ikaris look like he going berserk there.
Was on the fence on this film but I'm sold take my money now!  Looks like it could be the first marvel film to win a high ranking Oscar award!!!
I only watch these videos to hear you say “ruined” 🤤
I like the concepts and almost everything about this movie with this new trailer. I just can't decide on whether I like how it looks. Other then the celestials they look great.
Awesome breakdown man cant wait to see it
That's what ended up happening with stark and rogers and they never lived together and the events of mcu hasn't been that long lol
Wow you read the plot leaks and just told everyone what ikaris does to ajak and you play it off as “it’s just my theory, I might be wrong”  You know that’s what happens dude.
Eternals will boring as fuckk.. just another Filler MCU movie like black widow, Thor 2 & Hulk ( ed norton )
I feel like icarus is too powerful to be good, hes probably gonna be the bad guy. Or he could be the superman of Marvel i guess (which is not as interesting)
This looks and sounds interesting lol. I keep thinking this is same as in humans lol. And like this looks better than that show. More epic lol.
I never doubt ed you lol. You know what you are talking about lol
Good see some more brits and Camden market… in the MCU 🇬🇧
Hey, Just a random question, Can you see when you are shooting rays out of your eyes?
any releaseinfo on this?
If indeed the Eternals ARE advanced A.I., it would explain why apparently none of them for dusted.
There is going to be a weird twist to this. But this last trailer was splendid to give us why they couldn't get involved
But isn’t thanos a deviant so technically the eternals could of helped
I got and Underoath ad,  that's a sign to buy tickets for their upcoming tour? hahaha ❤❤❤
Paul the island volcano is Krakatau. Indonesian volcano 🌋big explosion in early AD and sometime in the BC they day. Also the son volcano exploded into the last 200 years
This trailer has made my hype for this movie go 📈📈📈
I really like that the Eternals could possibly be artificial intelligent machines. It will should how technically advanced the Celestials are and differentiate the Eternals from Mutants.
Am i the only one who is bothered by the fact that the eternals ship lools like a giant kitkat bar wIth the fourth piece missing, is this to suggest that kitkat's chemical composition is powerfull enough to witstand the suns rays?  Conspiracy WAKE UP SHEEPLE!!!!!
A part of me feels like Icarus won't be a bad guy I think Druig has something to do with this. He is very manipulative in the comics.
So the Eternals fight Deviants... Like Thanos?
Dopeeee, I’m way more excited now
No he cannot kill ajak.... Ajak is the leader of eternal and they never die.. Thankyou
Dr strange is gonna go crazy with these eternals around
The guy with the golden laser eyes and superman (to me) are very very similar
I loved the trailer, it was so intense.
OMG !!! WHAT A FUCKING TRAILER ! HYPED
It's a ok trailer I'm not to excited for this but I'm still going to see it.  Thanks for the breakdown keep up the good work.
Arishem is featured in the LEGO sets for this movie so it's basically confirmed its him and not Eson.
The whole reason they didn't interfere with Thanos is BS dude literally wiped out half the planet and they were told don't interfere c'mon Marvel 😒
This looks pretty awesome, definitely can't wait!
Kal-El welcome to marvel!!!
Don’t let them fool you, this is only a distraction from the absence of the No Way Home trailer.
“Sets up a love triangle between the three” Paul cuts to an out of context shot of a bunch of triangles. I see you mate 😂
There's literally a bit in the most recent Shang-Chi trailer where he spells out how to pronounce it. You've got to be misprouncing it on purpose at this point T_T
This man does not miss
But, but, but... didn't Thanos have the deviant gene?
My only worry is I think it's not the same people that done the mcu it's a completely different writing team directors etc what did you think of shang chi literally every report is triumph
the deviant shown fighting thena is kro,
It's a great trailer and for me it's one of the best of the years.
Im actually really excited for this movie. But i hope its good i hope hey dont mess it up
If you look tp the side of the volcano explosion you can see someone flying away from it in a streak!!! Looks completely different from the rest of the lava and debris
Marvel drops way too many trailers
What? No Groot?!
The meaning of the number 7 is also completeness and perfection but also number 9 is DIVINE representative of God's Holy Spirit, which are Faithfulness, Gentleness, Goodness, Joy, Kindness, Long suffering, Love, Peace and Self-control (Galatians 5:22 – 23) so it’ll be interesting to see who represents what aspect of this is using biblical themes
Hmm. Ikaris is like the Thor of the Eternals. It would be a huge paradigm shift if he was the heel. I would think, it's someone who is less muscle and more brains within the group. I think, it's Druig...Barry Keoghan is good at playing a creepy character.
Dude, u wrong, 7 days before the celestials come down to earth
Black knight : .... Why didn't u interfered Cersi : u know nothing John snow
Rather seen Dune more exciting compared to this
Big Superman vibes from the laser eyes.   DAMN I want a MoS sequel or whatever
Great trailer
Looks beautiful can't wait to see it!
What if ajak is thebbad guy thats why we dont see her with them anymore instead of being icarus
This trailer made me really want to see this movie now. I wasn’t too excited for it based off the previous trailers
Hopefully we see a celestial in action, but hopefully wanna see the living tribunal in action somewhere down the line
I think your way off with ya theory mate
movie looks great
The black knight was actually shown on the trailer, right?
The emergence is not the deviants it’s the celestial emerging from within the earth tearing it apart in the process
IKEA part got me hard 😂
the way HS talked About the ikea sponsorship made me sad :(   you are big!!
Awesome!  Thanks
I can't wait to see this! Looks amazing
I am excited for this movie. It definitely feels different than other marvel movies. Maybe not strictly better, but definitely different.
The Emergence is the dawn of mutants, the spark of energy that activates the mutant gene. The Eternals were explicitly introduced to set up mutants in the MCU.
I am one of those that am ambivalent about this movie and much of phase four.  It has been a long time since I was into comic books and I'm not sure if I ever heard of The Eternals or Shang-Chi until after zend Game.
I love how this trailer answers all the foolish people who said "why didn't they help vs Thanos"
I wonder if they’ll introduce the idea or just talk about vision. Maybe something along the lines of “humans tried to create a celestial like being called vision” & bring Ultron into talks. It would be cool since they’re machines as well.
That's Babylon. The tower of Babylon was a Ziggurat structure and they are also found in the Mayan ruins as well as ruins all over the world. There is a commonly ancestry of these societies that main stream secular scientist would like us to not know
Love the trailer and am actually looking forward to seeing this movie
The ikea joke got my to subscribe
7-8 years from now, i hope we'll be in love with this cast the way we are with current avengers. Can't wait for this next era 🔥
It looks 👍🏼
8:00 Krakatau, or Anak Krakatau
Can't wait to see all these new characters for the big screen! And the actors themselves.
Who do you think will survive this movie and who won't be
Giveawayyyyyyyyyyy
Ofcourse, Sersi works in a museum, she helped Sherlock after all to crack a code! :p
I would actually be angry if ikaris is a villain lol
if ajak dies, i swear to god!!!!!!!!!!!!!
8:52  Ikaris: “Avengers assem-“ Cersei: “Too soon.”
10:10 PS4 Controller on the table proves that even if you are an immportal living through the eternity, you won't get PS5 anytime soon... xD
Not interested in the movie much at all. May catch it on movie box like I do everything else tho. Here more bc of how Impressed I am at how quick the reaction video comes after the release of the trailer lol. Guess since it is a trailer and not a movie or episode then that makes it a lot easier
Ok, you have the emergence all wrong.  The emergence is the birth of a celestial.  The egg has been inside the planet and the eternals are on earth to help humans thrive which feeds the unborn celestial.  The return of. Half the population at once has fed the unborn celestial with enough power that it can now be born, destroying earth.  Your welcome 😊
Yeah your stupid rumblings and ridiculous theory. 🙄
For a brief, shining moment in the trailer I thought we were getting mutants
C'mon. It is obviously Registeel.
So we need to see if Ikarus has an iPhone or not?
This is my favourite Marvel trailer we've had this year so far and now my most anticipated movie which is weird because previously it was the one I was by far the least interested in.
The movie definitely looks promising !
I'm lost it when this dude said Ikaris was bad or maybe villain of this movie. Dude you already making extreme theories without even breaking down the trailer. My goodness, what a shame.
Not to bash you but you rush to make the first video without properly breaking it down. You made no mention to Jolie's character when she was looking at the small city. That looked important. Lol new rockstars will identify it. The race is not for the swift but those who endure it.
F"n amazing. I think this sets up the standard for phase 4&5
"We weren't allowed to interfere with threats other than Deviants" my *ss  Thanos WAS an Eternal and was deemed Deviant.  Not sure how they're gonna explain this one.
the visuals are gonna be crazy in the movie
Sorry best I can do 😂😂😂
The Eternals are the protectors of the Celestial egg which was buried on earth thousands of years ago. The egg isn’t suppose to hacking until millions of years later. I think the return of humans by Tony caused the process to speed up with the surge of energy.
Why did Phastos help Godzilla and Kong,  but didn’t stop Thanos? The world wants to know.
Here's a reach, Wanda's hex life/perfect life lasted for 7 episodes, on which she took a break on the 7th Day (callback to the book of genesis)
your wrong there is no evidence to prove I'm not even sure how that thought even came in your mind
I found the trailer really good and I  would really like a Loki cameo in pompei
This was awesome.
I can't wait till it finally release its sad I love marvel even most of my tattoos are marvel but I don't own 1 marvel movie.
I think a defiant killed Ajax instead!
😍😍😍
Bro love your videos but you are way off lol
I was more excited when I thought mutants were going to be introduced.  I’m not very hyped for this
Literally every habitable planet have a sudden burst of life when avengers bring everyone (every lifeform that Thanos snap into oblivion) back
I wanna see a dora milaje screaming "somthing entered the admosphere again"
I know nothing of the Eternals, never read them but i'm 100% hooked on this movie. It looks amazing!
1:48 of the trailer, if you look on the bottom right corner, you can see the end of a black cape…so I think black knight is confirmed
🙂😀😃 I mean this is what I wanted with the first trailer for Eternals. I'm so happy this is what they are doing!!
God created the Heavens and the Earth in 6 days. on day 7 he did nothing but rest.
I think if anyone of The Eternals switch sides it would be Ajax not Icarus. Icarus seems upset he may of had to put down Ajax. She is the one with all the convergence information and timeline so to me it seems likes she’s the one that signaled the Eternals not Icarus.
I can't wait!
Absolutely loved the trailer, can’t wait for the movie. But I think you really overthought on some of the points! Big fan of you along with the MCU
"It's like a family, no Vin Diesel"  Bars     Any thoughts on grime Paul?
Rob Strak x Homelander = Ikaris
Damn, you are fast. You had only a couple of hours to produce this video.
Honestly I’m really looking forward to this expanded universe that marvel is going for. Cause all the films so far have been focused around the main marvel comic heroes with like the avengers and gotg. So I’m really excited seeing them expand to other heroes like Shang chi and externals. Looking forward to seeing where they take all of this, like are we gonna have an endgame-like finale in a few years linking all the upcoming films together? Idk but I’m really excited
Ok, well a lot of your theories are incorrect, or at least very much at odds with what is established in the comics. For example, there is no way that the Celestials are "evolving" into Eternals - Celestials are pretty much at the peak of power in the Marvel Universe. But, if they are, it would be a massive change between the MU and MCU. But I don't understand one of your earlier points. If you said that the Eternals were created by the Celestials, that is absolutely in the comics canon. I don't understand why people were criticizing you for stating something that was established from day one in the comics.
Damn ikarus looking like supes the way he moves. Can't wait for this
Waiting for your breaking down 😍🔥
I thought Thanos carried the deviant gene, I guess that wasn't enough.
This doesn't look even slightly exciting.
The  Celestial who confronted Thena is actually Kro. You can see it when you switch the subtitles on
By introducing this powerful God like creature Marvel is ruining the our favourite superheros 😭😭😭
This trailer did a great job of showing why this film is important to the future of the MCU
I really hope the action isn't centered completely around big cgi dog momsters.
2:41 family 😂
7:45 it is a living indian meme IBU HATELA
Thank you for your Great Explanation 😄
Imma be honest, I wasn't interested at all in the eternals but now......     I'm still not interested lol.
Oh Heavy Spoilers you own my heart😂💕. I was like it's been 3hrs why haven't you or Eric made a breakdown video yet and BOOM you popped up😂💕. Bless your heart 🤭🤭🤭
kinda had superman vibes from ikaris
Really looking forward to this movie. Nice breakdown of the trailer.
DC is crying right now just by seeing this trailer
that deviant in the cave is a fricking teenage mutant ninja turtle and nobody can tell me its not
Thank you Chloe Zhao. This is going to be masterpiece.
if icarus bad, why sexy?
This looks so amazing. I am super pumped. 👌  But where is my Spiderman trailer?!
Ikaris is a bad guy he kills Ajak light spoils
Wow I’ve heard some bullshit in my life but your take on things is so far off it’s unreal 🤦🏻‍♂️
A Lego set said the Celestial is Arishem, the leader of the Celestials or something like that :D
When will this movie be released
Are celestials still alive?
this movie is gunna be incredible!!!
Mutants are here 😳🔥
Do Star Wars Visions trailer
Always showing luv to this guys breakdown. Great job Paul, here for the puns let's go!
See, I thought "the emergence" was referring to a baby celestial emerging from the planet earth.
It would be a perfect post credit scene to have Dane reaching for the sword and have Dr. Strange pop in to warn him
I hope this ends up being good, sincerely. Wild theory on Ikaris ending up as a bad guy, but if true would start the movie off crazy. I think maybe they just get attacked at that house instead, and he isn't able to save Ajak cuz she gets killed.
Kinda disappointed you didn't point out the double helix in the "o" in November. My theory is that the emergence they are talking about is the Eternals being able to alter life on earth to be born with powers- aka mutants. But... maybe you're not evolved enough to get it... YA HAVIN' THAT???
Ikoris better not be a bad guy he’s my favorite eternal. I see him leading the avengers
starfox is in the post credit scene! with PIP !
I think collecter was talking about Ikaris not Superman, that's why trailer came after What if episode 02
I just want to see Jon Snow and Robb Stark reunited 🐺
Hope we get to see Mephisto here 😂
10 points if Icarus flies too close to the sun at some point
Did Kang know about them?
7:56 Squidward:krakatoa
What would happen if Paul interfered?
Funny how they said they didn't fight Thanos because they only fight Deviants. But in the comics, Thanos is part Deviant.
You're right, the celestial with Athena could be Jumia or maybe Kronos, although he doesn't look like a giant silver surfer. :)  Since he is the leader of the eternals.  Just what I thought when I saw him
"They cannot interfere unless it involves deviants" but isn't thanos a deviant too???
Eternals looks spectacular visually!
I love how detailed your descriptions and theories are. I’m a comic book novice, so I also appreciate the background information on the characters!
Eternals will be visually stunning.  Looking forward to it.
LOL you "have a theory"... or you read the same leaked story everyone else read
Hmmm, now it makes sense why they call her *"CAPTAIN CARTER"* instead of Captain Britain, coz maybe they are planning to introduce another Captain Britain too. Captain Rogers (Captain America)  Captain Wilson (Captain America)  Captain Carter and Captain Braddock
You are always reaching, sir. 😜
I don’t know why people knock marvel for using green screens. Acting like their green screen visuals aren’t as beautiful and realistic as any.
is thanos a mix between eternal and a devient why they cant butt in then
So Ego is a celestial, in his history lesson we find out he's just a brain that learned how to manipulate matter and he created a planet around himself and learned how to create life forms to travel the universe, so are these celestials just brains too but they instead created gigantic robotic suits for themselves to navigate?
This movie is gonna be a Gamechanger in the MCU. 💖
I have no idea what is going on
It looked like Ajak was captured by that deviant and was being tortured. Maybe that's why she's not in many of the shots with all of them.
When will Mephisto show up?
Seeing the Celestials....my mind goes back to when i read Kirby's comics, damn that is glorious
I like it! I know it’s obscure marvel canon but so was GOTG
Sir absoulutely love your videos thank you so much. I know hard it is find so many details in this much time hats of to you sir👏👏
MARVELous❤️
At this point the no way home trailer be next year
I'm ready to get Spoiled
Marvel Fans: We want the No way Home trailer Me (A DC Fan) : I want the second Batman trailer
Legend. ❤️🔥
Wow, that "7 days" actually makes sense, coz this is all about Gods.
Why did Marvel release their Eternals' final trailer so early? (usually 4-6 weeks before film is released NOT 2 and half months)
I am really liking the look and feel of The Eternals. The music btw is by Ramin Djawadi! I can feel the epic-ness incoming.
the cast are all prettier than us
Looks pretty awesome, something a little different so im down
Eternals look amazing love the monsters
I did think of the 7 days of creation when Ajax said they had 7 days left, it’s like poetry………….they rhyme 😅 you having that
laju buat kerja bang. mantap
I am starting to ponder the question What If....Eternals and Kangs Variant was at babylon all this time 😂
ajax maybe gone to negotiate with higher ups .... btw the eye laser guys always get into triangles like scott in xmen
Spider man is boring.
but thanos was a deviant
This movie looks like its going to be dope asf
I’ve never laughed so hard in a trailer review 😂
7 days...   Oh yas the Ring vibes 😂
Release the Spider-Man No Way Home trailer, Sony!!!
Marvel sure knows how to run a franchise. I'm still waiting for that No Way Home trailer though.
3:43 could also be the the uni mind.
Chloe Zhao is master of cinematography and direction. She amazing. I cant wait to see it
The director really seems to have pushed it to a new level. I'm hyped for this movie, _pun intended_
But thanos had a deviant gene why didn't they come at that time 🤔🤔🤔🤔
This trailer seems to confirm the leaks to me, which also would mean your theory is somewhat wrong. Ikarus would be the bad guy, but because of what he knows about their purpose on earth and the consequences. Normally I avoid spoilers, but this was so strange and new to me that I wanted to find something to get me excited. The leaks and the trailer have done that - it will be epic and I'm super excited. But man, ppl seeing this movie unspoiled might be in for a shock ;)
I wonder what future movies the Eternals will appear at in the future (minus possible sequels)
Bruuhh this trailer was so epic!!! Definitely going to see it now when it comes out. Still want that No Way Home TRAILER though!!!
The Celestial is Arisham, as there was a lego set that leaked it
This movie looks incredible
Wow . I like your humour man... This makes you unique from all
Ye the trailer looks pretty good but eh idk when characters who are opaf like these guys and say that they could’ve done A but couldn’t cuz of B Plus Icarus seems like he’s Homelandering a bit lol Also isn’t the number 7 God’s number or something
Great breakdown. Loving the very eclectic cast and real locations over copious CGI backdrops approach. More hopeful and keen to see this than I have been for the last few Marvel movies...
Amazing video!!!
Pleas don't make ikarus a bad -guy. We have plenty of bad superman-like characters at the moment.
Damn this looks insane 🔥🔥
I had no real knowledge on the eternals when the first trailer came out and I thought it was gonna be a big flop,but this trailer has me exited it’s gonna be epic .
Gilgamesh's actor <3  I fucking love that guy
If the celestials are still alive in present day, it would be so awesome to see more of them.
Things come and go but Heavy Spoilers is Eternal
Kro looks like Voldemort from the first Harry Potter movie lol
The celestial 🔥🔥🔥
Actually,  God created all things in 6 days. He reasted on the 7th.
Eternals and Shang chi do not look good.
Marvel: We are releasing the movie in november. Heavy spoilers in Aug: There will be SPOILERS!!!  *I lost the heart from the comment when i edited it the first time.*  Thank you Bryce & Tornado ☺️
It seems like the Deviants are back and they have to fight them, even we saw the Celestial!
The VFX look amazing, even tho they're not final yet I guess.
i'm so hyped for this movie !!!
Between Black Widow this and Shang Chi these all just look boring to me
Probably looking forward to this one more than any of the others
Do you even Sleep bro 😂😂
This film looks more amazing and enticing the more I see of it! The Celestial just forming from no where with what looks like a galaxy in his hands🤷🏽‍♂️The fight scenes look good, even the flying one doesn’t look too bad either! Also are they doing Kro from the comics? The Deviant who’s holding and talking to Thena ?
I don't want ikaris theory come true
Hype
BUT THANOS IS PART DEVIANT.....HELLOOOOO!!!
Keep it up and down to the following is a lot of work and I have a great day and a great year ahead and you can take deepslate and Morty were in marvel at the same time and I am not able to contact me at your end it is not a broad spectrum of the following its two of the following is not correct please send me the patty of the year ahead to be able to contact you again for all your support and Morty season 5 in which the following chemicals is not correct as Ironman is not correct please let me know what is meaning of the following its two of the following is a un used to be able I am not able to contact me at the same as the following its two of the same time as I can 🥫 the following as Ironman
it was great growing uo thru the 70s & 80s and watching these comics i read as a kid be brought to life on the big screen.
This trailer is really amazing!!! I'm sooo excited for Eternals. I hope that it will be better then my expectations! Right now I'm going to watch this video!
ikarus is the main villain , i am also getting this weird feeling
They literally copy the architecture of Babylon from Fate Grand Order Babylonia  anime. Copy catters!
First of the trailers to actually peek my interest in this movie, previous ones have been very meh
This kinda looks boring.
You’re absolutely killing it on speed lately mister.
Ikaris hitting the table asking if it’s vibranium could be a nod to that one blooper in age of ultron where scarlet Johansson couldn’t lift a table and said it was made of vibranium.  Reaching further than Reed Richards I know.
@4:35 Boy am I glad the sun didn't melt that giant Kitkat!!!
I thought thanos a deviant?
Man when that celestial showed up my jaw literally dropped off.
WHY DIDN'T ETERNALS HELP US ? Because Kevin Feige said so
Damn, this movie will definitely overcome avatar in box office collection and will get one or two oscars!!!
Just when I had no more videos to watch about my nerdy content, along comes Heavy Spoilers saving the day 👏🏽 I’ll be back after I watch the trailer
This looked awesome. Please not let it be as dark themed as the DC world
The Eternals watched The Ring vhs tape
Good info. Thanks
Great video
I want a Heavy Spoilerman cameo in a Marvel movie! Give it to us, Marvel!
GOOD MORNING WORLD... this trailer is pure beauty
I bet deviants are playing similar role of skrulls in trailers. Ofc they will be good in a way. Ikaris is ofc bad guy, he is homelander of marvel
Honestly, at this point, can they just say when the movie is? We don't really need a trailer. We're gonna go regardless. AND! It's gonna be good regardless.  Like, in my reality, No Way Home just dropped on December 25th and we didn't need a trailer and we were all happy to see our favorite Spider-Men together onscreen.
Spoiler man spoiler man
Hi from south Africa. Love your breakdown
Visually stunning movie but let's see bit skeptical you know it will cover entire mcu history , deviant gonna be main threat , will probably set up some cosmic level threat . Yeah not expecting great from the movie
🔥
but doesn´t thanos have a deviant gene?
I think Ajak was referring to the sleeping celestial in the Thanos scene. She said the “emergence” . Then they cut to a scene or something coming out the ground pulling the earth inwards.
Jon Snow asking the question everyone memed about. He knows something after all.
Honestly, this movie isn't really my cup of tea! However, your breakdown of the trailer seem more exciting than the actual trailer!! Great job Paul!! 👏
This is a Disney+ watch in a few months when it’s done in the theaters.  But don’t be afraid to drop the post credit spoilers ASAP
isnt thanos a divient?
Ey!! There he is
Deviants + angelina jolie eternal creates first INHUMAN IN MCU.
Awesome trailer huh?
is this the first time we finally see a celestial
Im feeling alot more confident about this movie now with this trailer 😆
Marvel is really knocking it out the park with both movies. I do wish it was also streaming.
Fastest man on the internet !! Trailer just dropped and already here is the breakdown .
I don't want Ikaris to be bad....
Fabulous Trailer 👌
Eternals is one my most anticipated Marvel movies!
The Eternals is gonna be a masterpiece.
Fantastic breakdown!!!! I cannot wait for externals
Bravo marvel clap clap bravo
been waiting for this vid since the trailer came out
You'll get your trailer when you FIX THIS DAMN TIMELINE
Come thru Paul. This mew trailer has me HYPE!!!
Film looks amazing, can’t wait for it to release
Not gonna lie but to me The Eternals is overshadowing Shang-Chi hard!
Wouldn’t it be hilariously mean if Marvel never released a Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer? That way no one really knows what to expect when they go into the theater (besides the already confirmed stuff).  But they’re most likely release it during Venom 2 release though. But it would still be funny to see all of YouTube lose their minds at the lack of a Spider-Man trailer.
How can Ikaris kill Ajak though? Aren't the eternals supposed to be immortal?
People who hates spoilers still stick around just to hear you talk
When Eson appeared my jaw dropped!
That intro got me. 😂
Bro be soooooo f***ing faster than makkari
Never been this early.  Feels good, man.
Love this intro Paul

Trailer looked legit
Damn this guy is fast af!!!
Glad I got to see the new Eternal trailer before you made the video for it!! First time ever!!!! Yea there’s that rush of dopamine I desperately needed.  🦦  Side note-  I think the Celestial they showed was Eson the Searcher, right?
second
Dude, I almost crapped myself thinking it was Galactus, only to read the comment section, & reading everyone roasting the people like me who thought the same lol 😆
This is starting to look rather good.   Thanks Paul. 🙏
third?
be grateful...  imagine being an Eternal, having to wait 7,000 years for a No Way Home trailer
been waiting for a breakdown
There it is!!! Been waiting since 4am for this video. This trailer has me so excited!!
Honestly can’t wait for this, it looks so good
I think marvel listened and made eternals look interesting
Waiting for that spiderman trailer like
It’s sooo sick man
First?
First love from 🇵🇭
