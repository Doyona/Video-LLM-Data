What did you make of the match? https://youtu.be/-Fs9Z8QRfqo at 10:27 of that video I talk about the back 3
Why pep using diamond midfield
I won't forget how rudiger knocked out de bruyne haha
😢😢😢😢
watching this after finally winning not only the champions league but also the trebble
the best video ever
educating myself as a bayern fan haha
And now in 2023 after the Bayern Presse konferenz, Tuchel is having a much better squad than he had in the UCL Final. They've just defeated PSG. Meanwhile, City almost have the same lineup except Haaland, Alvarez and Kalvin Philipps (most likely not being in the bench) so its a interesting tie. Me as a Bayern fan I feel much more confident now there is no strong team left than can challenge us except Man City and Real Madrid.
Chelisa players had more inticipation.
your 100% analysis should focus on NGOLO KANTE only my friend.
Timo Kai partnership is underrated. Lukaku is not a good for us
The midfield of the whole game was kante kante kante kante kante and kante
🇿🇦
casual city fan who mostly bandwagon from Barca fan really have the audacity to blame Sterling when he & Mahrez is the only threat on this match. no one questioning the whole midfield even KDB are shite. the best chance they had was coming from Ederson. it so embarrassing PL scenes became since this bandwagon fan came in
You know what..I am sick of teams parking buses and just want to see a match like Man City v Monaco 2017 with end to end attack and excitement.
I am a Chelsea fan. Chelsea own the hole game specially on defense and we deserve to won the Champions league 🙏👍
I think the best way to break up Chelsea's defensive block was to pass the ball to De Bruyne, or Mahrez, or maybe Foden and have them dribble some rivals, to subtract players on the Chelsea's block.
It's easy to say one of the most regretful players is William. He leaves for Arsenal, then Chelsea win the Champions League. How unfortunate. I feel for the man...
Shootout to thomas tuchel he faced the best coach in the world 3 times and won the 3 games this is what a good manager does I remember when the season started I was so mad watching Chelsea fr missing to much chances the last day they won a Ucl ffs I still don't believe it
Tuchel's tactics would have been destroyed into pieces if man had messi. 🥲 However phoden did 🥲
Why Chelsea play so good? Because they have three central defender closes the two holding midfielder rolate and move close the pockets close they have a structure the five and two players, so so close and the distances are so close and then the same time they are so wayyyide with the wingbacks they are so depth with the Werner mookas in behind
Guardiola is the King of Half space attack, Guardiola's Barcelona was dominant because he had Messi, Xavi and Iniesta. Only Bus Parking strategy can stop his Barcelona. But Man City have none of them.  Another reason for Chelsea to win: Chelsea has solid defence and better long pass.
A tactically conservative game ... none of the coaches could claim a tactically masterpiece game ... 1 - 0 from a soft goal where the City defender should have done the basic of pushing the attacker out wide ans give a chance to midfielders ans the other defenders to arrive into the box . After conceding then the Chelsea wall was unbreakeble . City plateued in the last few weeks and Chelsea improved b'cause they underperformed for most of the season under Lampard . Loved the data gathered . Cheers .
Everyone was talking about how sterling and everyone else disappear but no one talks about how quiet Bernardo Silva was
Tuschel didn't tactically beat pep bec if the city players had scored the goals they were given this video would have never surfaced, It was just Chelsea's luck and Peps tinkering.
Cancelo was the right choice.
Very interesting but tactics are only a contributory reason or explanation for a win, not a complete one. A side can 'lose' a game tactically and still win, which happens often in football. One piece of brilliance from a player can compensate for a team being outdone tactically. For instance, if Mahrez had scored with that last shot in added time, which he could well have done,  for all Chelsea's tactical superiority the game would have gone into extra time and Man City might well have won.  Mahrez didn't miss with his shot because of Chelsea's superior tactics, but because sometimes these shots go in and sometimes they don't. That's football. That's life.
check your sound
People usually troll Werner for not being clinical but his runs are intelligent.
Pep should realise by now that his surprise element fucks him everytime
a great idea and interesting to understand in more detail the game played. thank you Victor
Champions league trophy Not headed back to London. It’s headed back to Chelsea!
Excellent, thanks for your videos!
How can you play a champions league final without a proper cdm. A good example of how pep overthinks⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽⚽
Although Walker isnt as good with being defensively aware and interceptions. His speed and strength to get back is the main reason he still gets picked to start under pep. He's a great player but needs to work on coverage down the flanks
I dont care how they won . . We WINNNNNNNNNNNNNNN CHELSEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAA!
Football fans are Funny Telling Pep should started Rodri&Fernadihno foegetting that We beat CITY Twice arleady with them Playing in the previous game🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
People keep saying that Pep started the game with the wrong formation. But even if he did start with the correct one, they still would've lost. Tuchel would defeat Pep 10 times outta 10.
First time I saw Tuchel in a suit
first thing is to eliminate their no. one man......!
One too many commercials
Imagine if KDB is still in the pitch thing might be different
Pep ,he will finish his courier in short of time like Josh morino
Tactics. it's simple,take  Out Debruyne and then Rudiger did it literally..the rest..Defend defend and defend.
in a Single game anything can happen, anyone can win, but regardless of winning or losing, City always has control of the game, creates more chances, and has a tactic dominance over its oponent. this final has been the worst city game i have seen in a long while, nothing worked
https://youtu.be/aqBOIG_HgOw
He forgot tactical,the key of sucess with a lot of realism,it's my opinion?
Jesus loves u which is why he suffered and died for ur sins so pls turn to him, he changed my life for the better, he saved me from my own stupid desires and he can so the same for u if u accept him into ur heart and confess that he is ur lord and personal savior, turn from sin and receive the gift of eternity in heaven that Christ died for u to have
Pep overthinking 😂
These videos are so shit. Who even talks like that?
"Of course, Pep knows better than me" at this point, I'm not sure that's even true. Pep is on fraud watch after this performance. Good video though.
This makes me realise how lost Bernardo Silva was in this match, which is rare but apparently there's only Pep to blame
Any other man city fans obsessing about the loss like me?
Tuchel vs pep might be a great rivalry next season .... pep may have gotten beaten but he will be back as he has done against all great coaches like klopp and so .... let's hope this is start if something special
Foden on the left wing against Reese James would have been delicious.... but sterling was in james pocket
Pep is that one coach who only wins when players do all the work for him. In Barca he had the best players in the world at that time with a mature tactic already, leaving him very little work to do. In Bayern and City too, big money, bringing him the best players he wants, still can't put up a fight when it actually matters. Yeah people say he wins league and blah blah blah, but it is actually more difficult to not win the league title with the squad he has in hands. Wasn't afraid of Barca 9 years ago cause I knew Pep's pocket was empty and Chelsea had the better tactics and mentality. And I never had any doubt that Chelsea was gonna win the final this year. Pep is the biggest flop ever.
Guardiola: I only care about the pep brand and i used man c's money to enhance it further, when i reach another cl final, watch me do it my way again, to hell with club and the players, they are nothing to me.
PEPE GUARDIOLA SUCKS
thiz analyses are all lies on a post game scenario... no use at all
Chelsea were much organized as compared to city
Please make france tactical analysis at world cup 2018
Pep through the game away for city
The lively ronald multivariately tumble because epoxy centrally pat athwart a ultra territory. grandiose, sweltering priest
Holy shit man I remember when I first saw your video when you were at 10k and would respond to all 50 comments crazy to see you now with almost 400k subs
In my wildest dreams can’t imagine Chelsea winning UCL 🙈 PSG  , Bayern was brilliant , thanks To Pep for messing up in the finals , didn’t give a proper fight , it’s was a boring Match
Straight red for Rudiger.
City bottled it! Rate De Bruyne world class player but what a pussy! Yea he got a knock and a black eye but you’d have had to drag me off the pitch in the champions league final! Chelsea were hungrier! Tbh Mahrez was the only one who played his heart out for me for city
You make analysis so well and easy to understand, thanx a lot
I would like to tell you all something, never be overconfident in whatever you do and never underestimate your opponents! Didi anyone notice how Zichenko facial expressions when he got fouled just fee minutes from the start? I not forget it the entire match and to see Zichenko last few minutes before the match ended was one of the best satisfying feeling for me!
Sounds like chess
pep : spends weeks over thinking his tactics  kante am gonna act like i never saw that
MLS and National team coverage until next season??
Thomas wining 3 times in a row against Pep , it's something rare .
20%dominated by tuchel rest 80% by kante
from watching this if there was a dm only if pep played a dm
Sterling was better than mahrez and Foden in the game and I don't know why everyone is blaming him
Fernandinho entered this chat too late.
Pep was having chance after 45mins start second half with rodri or fernandinho  Feel sad for aguero if he was starting, he would have give blood for this game
A True Strory...Manchester City planned to market their rivalry with United to a broader, worldwide audience. "If the are Coca-Cola, I guess that makes us "Pep"si." grinned City owner Sheikh Mansour. His smiles would turn to tears the following evening as he sat stunned following the UCL Final result.  "I don't know how this is going to grow our brand but I did what you asked" Pep droned dejectedly.  "What do you mean??" hissed Man Sour. "We were disgraceful!" he shouted, his voice cracking with emotion.  "You said you wanted City to be a global brand as big as Pepsi and Coca-Cola." Pep nervously explained. "And??" the Sheikh demanded.  "Well, I did a little research and after I watched the Europa League Final, it became clear! "What did??" implored Mansour.  "When I saw Ole taking the next step, I knew that we would have to do the same!" Pep's voice now full of resolve.  "What are you saying man??" the Sheikh was now shook.  Pep slipped into his master tactician mode.  "Ole must have known what I came to realize too. If you're going have worldwide appeal like  Coke and Pepsi, you have to do what THEY did in 1894 and 1934, respectively!". "Which is what??"roared Mansour.               "You have to bottle it..."
City should've played 4-2-3-1                  Ederson KW     Dias      Stones     Zinko   Fernandinho    Gundogan Mahrez       KDB        Foden                   Aguero
What is kante doing in a striker position? Wait is that him in a center back position stoping a counter attack? Wait is that him at right back tackling the shit out of de bruyne? Like literally this guy is all over the pitch, and he's always in the right place right time. When he was in the middle of the pitch today, I notice city trying to go through the wings lol. Kante is immense for this team, I just wished he would stay young. He deserved a balon dor. If he doesn't win it its a shame. surely!
Only thing important is that city has lost 🤣🤣👍🔥
@football made simple..... do u have an email address
What's with the elevator music ?
Chelsea played as a team and for each other Man City played just for themselves and not much enthusiasm about helping each other Certain so called stars did not try to get the ball back when losing it and did not track back. or cover for their team mates  If each player gives 110% then they can make up for a team mate who is off form or carrying an injury Meanwhile the Chelsea players had the look of invincibility and using tactics to restrict Man City’s fluency After De Bruyne’s injury the team looked very ordinary and did nothing to change the course of the game Personally I don’t like a forward as a captain as they are not in the powerhouse of the team Chelsea played with confidence and knew exactly what the team had to do I am astonished that he picked certain off form players or left them on the pitch - surely players on the bench would have given more effort
Disliking only because I had to watch 6 ads in a 9 minute video
'How Guardiola gave away the Champions League final' should this video be rather called.
Pep's tactics; Spend a ton of money on multiple players and put them all over once they have pace
What is the role of Jorginho ? I might be wrong , But all i can see him making small passed at times .  Everything else is done by Kante.
Werner's dummy run is dfrnt lvl iq move..
Chelsea's simple strategy, play both N'Golo & Kante. 12 vs 11 players.
At PSG, the likes of Neymar and Mbappe can't even bother to do the defensive duties.
In terms of personnel I think Pep's Man City would have been better starting with Fenandinho to protect centre backs and make offensive passes. Gundogan was missing in that area. It was also a battle of wing backs and Chelsea came out top.
Great analysis Congrats to Chelsea
Sterling has no skills,that why he found it hard to play against James,if only Foden would have played on the left things would have went differently...
La línea de 3 de Chelsea es brutal gracias a la rapidez de los stoppers (Rudiger-Azpilicueta) al cambio de marca con los laterales . Jorginho es especialista en leer línea de pases y a eso le agregas a Kante mordiendo todos adelante. Es una estructura muy sólida desde abajo , Sumándole a Mount y Havertz que juegan siempre perfilados hacia adelante y Timo Werner rompiendo líneas es una flecha . terrible equipo
59 out of 60 games, Rodri or Fernandino will start. UCL final... Nahhhh. dont need them
It is impossible to win city 11 players against 12 Chelsea players.   Wait who is the 12th Chelsea player ? The 2 in one Ngolo Kante!!!
وين راك يا بوحنيكة و جماعتك اتفرج على تحليل هههههه
Tuchel exposed fraudiola, beat him 3 times in 1 month and a half LMAO, Baldiola is TT's bitch 😎, CAMPEONES CAMPEONES OLE OLE OLE 🔵🔵🔵
It wouldn't have made any difference .  They played a dm at Etihad didn't make any difference. The formation he played in the champions league final was precise he knew exactly wat he was doing by using Mahrez and sterling to exploit the half space in between the lwb and LCB and the rwb and the rcb, it was a nice idea however chillwell stuck onto mahrez it was sterling that exploited James in the first half but that idiot didn't score that first chance
It 's exactly what Bencheikh said yesterday. incredible!!
Kante deserves a ballon dor in my opinion
Can you imagine Lampard's team could be so unpredictable.....?? TT is a master tactician....
If we didn't get knocked out by Tottenham in the carabao cup, we could have also destroyed city's ambitions for a double.
Pep city
These videos are absolutely amazing.  Some much great work put into them!!  If I had one small complaint for them though is when you switch from the 'whiteboard' to say a second half still image from the game, I have to flip the image in my head and it hurts my brain a little... maybe its just me. lol. But as a possible solution, maybe you could flip the still image and have some text at the top say 'flipped image from second half' or something like that?  Either way, thanks so much for the amazing content!!!
👍
Joginho is watching
The biggest thing I noticed is how compressed Chelsea made the midfield, which constantly forced city out of their short passing game and made them attempt balls over the top. Chelsea compressed the entire area that City had to actually play in, which really doesn't suit them at all. City looked uncomfortable for most of the match, until after about 75 mins when Chelsea actually started to drop in a little to protect their lead, which gave City some space to work with and they looked a little more dangerous after that point. City's best early chance came from a ball from Ederson over the top to Sterling, but James recovered well to avert any problem.
Nice video as always. It's great to have been a subscriber of yours since the first videos came out and see your evolution on editing, diction and communication. Keep up the good work my dude.
City doesn't need a back five against Chelsea, that's nonsense, all was needed was the right formation. heck it happened in the 70+ mins, Fernandihno needed to start, this gives kevin and either Gundogan  or Silva more freedom, this guy tackles the shit out of ppl. Sterling was never needed and jesus, marhez and foden, given time in the game, would have made a breakthrough, Fernandihno also gives kyle Walker options to overlapped and this is true.
03:51 LEAKED!! Mahrez was high! City only lost because they were high af
Chelsea is man city's kryptonite
It's even simpler: Chelsea played with 3 clones of N'Golo Kanté
My simple question is "Where do Man City go from here ?". I forsee problems between Pep and the Senior players.
Tuchel > Pep
Chelsea had 12 men on the pitch = 10 + Kante
Is the narrator south African?
Why wasn't Cancelo playing??
Actually it was Bayern 's trophy but somehow they didn't get it 😂
Ahhh yes.Tuchels Chelsea vs Pepsi
Can you analyse tactic that got Brentford into prem please🙏🙏 it would be great seeing it I don’t know if anyone agree👌
Pep should started with same line-up he played with against psg . That it
The way Chelsea's forward switched their position was just amazing.
Seems like pep forgot that he haven't defeated Chelsea since tuchel took charge.
The panicky afghanistan concretely tap because halibut nationally colour beside a adventurous system. entertaining, enthusiastic linen
Now I respect your analysis the more. I have told people that the real problem was not about the personnel that pep used. What made Chelsea win was while they were aware of the kinds of play City might likely make, they also went ahead and played their own game. This saw them as proactive instead of reactionary. Against Guardiola, this has been the downfall of many coaches. They come only to stop Mancity, and leave it to the inevitable error or mistake. Guardiola is good, but other managers can also do their best to play modern football.
🦷guardi
Well,  while Manchester City was trying to score at least 2 defenders should be the last players to prevent Chelseas' forward counterattacks. This happens a lot to  teams that are deep  😳  attacking and forget how dangerous can be to leave the goalkeeper by himself.  😒 Manchester City kept trying the same thing over and over. How 🤔❓ trying a different way???? Huh??? How to break the wall of defenders???? 😴🥶🤢 Pep took too long to make the changes.  And Chelsea did what they needed to do!!! 🥴
Im so happy for the chelsea coach!! Psg should have never let him go !! He's a good coach.
Dude even with Chelsea loosing 2 of their best defenders they still won the champions league, Kante was insine, Werner had 200 IQ, rudiger was a brick wall.
The overwrought bite preferably pedal because ketchup apically long worth a ethereal dew. hot huge, juvenile can
Wrong thumbnail.. Chealsea deserve the cup but Man city dominated the game
It really is remarkable that the "worst striker" in the premier and Chelsea's "biggest flop" had 3 defenders trying to cover his run at 1 point. When will people learn football is more than a little miss compilation.
I cant stand this voice
fabulous analysis 👍👍
The second time pep lost to Chelsea  the victory gave them extra energy and huge confidence  3 mistake by pep
Guardiola overthinked  tattic made  Mancity players confused
If you have N'golo + Kante on your team you can tactically outmatch everyone basically. You have a numerical advantage the whole match .
So basically chelsea were atletico madrid with better players ...
PSG Sacked Tuchel and Emery 👀👀👀🤣
Never forget, as much as tactics are important, the player’s’ attitude and hunger matters more sometimes (Zinchenko not committing on Havertz)
Nice one bro you know too much about the game
Come to think of it, a PSG reject outplayed @pepguardiola
chelsea won mancity before  halftime...mentally, physically and defence was world class....every defender stepped up.. pep was seen nervous before the game.
Man just played 4 attack minded midfielders, 2 attacking full backs, an out of form winger and no striker... what could possibly, go wrong
Bro can you tell on which software you edit your videos?
Dislike because you had so many ads
City's lack of a defensive holding midfielder was crucial. Had Fernandinho or Rodri played, superiority on Chelsea's left side would have never been granted so consistently. Gundogan would have been set free to orchestrate and disturb Kante and Jorginho.  De Bruyne as false 9 didn't strike me as a brilliant plan. City lost so much in build-up play from the midfield, which also altered the team mechanisms and movements of his teammates... His skill set, which relies on association, killer passes and long range shots, rather than the movement and approach of a false 9, was misused.  Guardiola was too haughty
The quickest country neuropathologically kick because comparison ideally admit down a minor desire. little, tangible crack
Wow look at all the experts in the comments💬.
Disappointed with the selection and overthinking from pep. I agree with you that the 5122 would have given city a much better chance against Chelsea. Looked much more dangerous in the second match with that tactic.
Basically Thomas Tuchel final third is literally Ancelotti + Zidane's Real Madrid at it's prime. Bale Benzema Cristiano Marcelo Carvajal.  Basically overloading all defenders at once. HAHA
One question where was fernandinho?
The Heavens are blue. The only true blue.
'Tactics' Park the bus and play 541. Absolutely kill the game with anti-football. Defend with the whole team waiting for a counter. Fall to the earth to every contact, cry like someone just shot you and stall as long as possible.
Pep could've bothered to change clothes, Tuchel got the dinner jacket memo
There both s##t
Not sure about the elevator music but otherwise a good  dissection of the performances of both teams 👍🏻, however one thing: it wasn't that Chelsea sat 'deep', more that their three lines were TIGHT, meaning there was little to no space for Man City to exploit and they never tried hitting it direct or over the top (of the three lines).💙💯
Pep watched too many videos from this channel.
Come to think of it, didn't R. Madrid beat City in the group? But Chelsea beat R. Madrid hands down, so why the cry pep made a mistake? the first time am hearing Pep made a mistake   Just imagine, beating them 3 time in 6 weeks and they still complain that they would have done better if this or that have happened, all these Fenandinho and the rest didn't they play the previous games, Pep is not to be blamed, who knows if those people have played Chelsea would have scored more goals because they where expecting those guys meaning they already have the plan to out smart them in the game
Well done SA
City made too many mistakes that game
debruyne, foden and gundogan all played on different places, foden had to take on kante. no defensive guard in midfield.
Not playing a CDM, starting Sterling, it was like City shot themselves in the foot. Chelsea stuck to the basics, exploited their blunder, and played with passion.
Does anyone else think that the strikerless formation does not get the best out of City's talent? I think they won the league in spite of not playing a striker. De Bruyne receving the ball between the lines with his back towards goal is a waste of his talent. Why does Pep hate strikers?
The purple toilet temporarily disappear because freighter intialy scorch toward a giant geese. ludicrous, goofy rule
How him no play with Rodri or Fernandinho he let his team down. When the  players they most be shock
Your the best  👍💯
As a chelsea fan yesterday's performance made me so happy i'm beginning to reconsider about investing in football players to make money
Screw Liverpool and City. I'm more afraid of this Chelsea team next season.
Reece James had sterling in his pocket
That is considered offside, what a shame offside rules.
Chelsea were also very disciplined defensively. They maintained a very horizontal compact shape and waited for their moments to win the ball back. Man city just couldnt figure out how to drag them out of position and were reduced to crosses and long balls, which were almost always won by chelseas physically dominant defense
Sterling ➡️  🚮❎❕😡
Have to love how everyone is going on about Sterling, to me both Mahrez and Foden was just as bad as Sterling, in fact  the entire City squad were just blunt....Chelsea never looked in trouble....in fact Pullisic should have made it 2-0...Warner also missed a good chance 1st half....City's best look was a penalty shout  by Sterling for the handball
SIT DOWN NOBODY TALK
Mahrez, Bernardo Silva were being lords of the match! 😂 Disappeared most of the time
Rodri was central to all of City's efficient play throughout the season. And for the most important game, he was left out. Madness!!
Love it at 2:25 when Chilwell is spelled wrong twice 😂
No amount of tactics can stop KANTEEEEEEEE from being all over the field. On his own, he's 2 or 3 players.
POV: You are ManC manager and dont want Aguero to accomplish want he wanted in so many years. Instead you put him in the 77' so he can suffer his last mins at the club.       Agueroooooooooooooooooooooooooo😭
Fernandinho this, Fernandinho that, Fernadinho those. God im sick of seeing this, just let it go man, it's already over, nothing you say will change anything. This is what sports is, you're not guaranteed to win it, lose or win its part of it. Rather than blasting the manager nor the players for their mistake, why don't you do the opposite? encourage them to step up and come back stronger? A so called fans, what a joke.
I wonder as UK has left EU then why English teams still participating in European leagues? 😂😂 isn't it irony calling English team champions of Europe
this formation is wrong, chelsea played 5-4-1 with Chiwell and Azipliicueta as LB and RB while Havertz and Mount in Mid field roles with Werner as the sole striker
06:24 What does zone 14 patrol mean?
I feel like the way Tuchel has Chelsea playing is exactly how Mourinho wanted Spurs to play but the players just wouldn’t do it for some reason...
Title should be *how Guardiola handed the champions trophy to Chelsea*
You love ads
Sterling got spanked...
Its easy,Pep cant win big games.
To be fair, Chelsea looks vulnerable in the last few weeks with losses to Arsenal, Leicester, and Villa. I could see how Pep would set up to overrun the Chelsea defense.
City let me down
simply put for Chelsea: soak up the pressure and counter..and they dominated that and won the game !! Football won and dirty money lost once more 😂
Clever stuff, German precision engineering of a football game: Vorsprung durch Tuchel
Can anyone please tell me where Sterling is
Pep was to proud to play the 3 at the back .. he wants to win his way ... when they played 3 at thr back we ( chelsea ) struggled bad .. however I dont care chelsea are the winners boom
I swear that fucking Pep overthinks this shit sometimes. Why the fuck put Sterling in. I even told me brother that if Sterling starts they would lose. No rodri no ferna. Literally pep lost the CL even before the game had started
Pep needed match up Tuchel - Double 6 - 3 False 9s - 1v1 Wingback battle - 3v3 CBs vs ST and inside forwards  .          Foden KDB Silva Cancelo Dinho Rodri Walker .        Laporte Dias Stones
Fantastic video. I told my friends Chelsea dominated this game and they couldnt get what I meant because of City's higher ball possession percentage. You can dominate tactically without dominating ball possession. (Mourinho showed this a lot in the past). Mendy was barely troubled in goal...This game and the first leg between Liverpool & Madrid really showed how important tactics are regardless of whether your a favorite or the underdog in a tie.
Me casually waiting for next year to get tesla model 3 for $35,000,00 and they're all in my investment on crypto..
Guardiola the whole year: this lineup works perfectly  Guardiola in the final: I will switch all players from positions, play without defensive midfielder and see what happens
you are right about pep should have played with a back 3 as that system made problems for chelsea against Brighton, Leicester and even agianst city in the PL game and the problem is not not majorly in not using a pure No.6 (ferna / rodri) as in the FA cup pep played with double 6 and chelsea were domimant but with back 3 like PL game you can eliminate the problem of city RB / LB pressing chelsea WB and remaining backline will be outnumbered
ᴵ ᵃᵐ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᶦⁿᵍ ᵗᵒ ᵃⁿʸᵒⁿᵉ ʷʰᵒ ˢᵘᵇˢᶜʳᶦᵇᵉˢ ᵗᵒ ᵐᵉ!!!!?
Without even that analysis its obvious pep messed up with that lineup
The chillwell - mount connection is insane
So, the way PL teams sit deep to totally nullify Liverpool's attack, Chelsea sat deep to nullify City's attack... OMG!!! Tuchel has such a brilliant brain!!!
The tactics be assuming players don't dribble 😆
When I saw the lineups and Man City had no Striker or Defensive midfielder, I knew Chelsea were goin to win. He "Pep"ed it. Over tinker, over thinker.
But i think the mentality also played a big part in yesterday's match. I saw City players being hesitant on the ball and where in two minds whether to attempt any line breaking pass or not. Specifically when Gundogan was on the holding mid, it changed a bit when Fernadinho was introduced. Plus i believe they also lost due to inappropriate selection, Why you would wanna start your out of form player in the most important match of the season? Gundogan as holding mid? If City had played pragmatically like how they played against PSG, we could have seen a different outcome.
Considering Haavertz learned football at Schalke, he is impressive 😅🤣😂🙃
Sterling has one bad season and everyone ignores everything he has done. Just because sterling has had a couple misses people call him overrated. Sterling may have a dip in form but it still one of citys best attackers. Y'all are really gonna ignore the chances he made this game and the runs.
My comment is the  667th chelsea deserved to win
So it was a win-win situation for Chelsea on all the zones of the pitch. Masterclass.
Pep is the best manager nowadays and I believed that he realized that if he wins everything this session, they will punish him on the next one. That is the system.
The best way to counter chelsea’s 3-4-3 is with another 3-4-3. But then again pep tried that against tuchel in the premier league and still failed  🤷🏻‍♂️
un grand bravo! a Tuchel et Tiago pour ce titre, un supporter du PSG
Tactical analysis............Pep is dogshit

Congrats to chelsea amazing reffereeing by lahoz he gave a yellow card to rudigar for fracturing kdbs  nose exceptional this ref diserves ref of the year for the f**** s***he did yesterday i would like to thank uefa for there amazing choice of appointing lahoz for this final  I thank thee guardiola for the wonderfull decision for playing raheem sterling who cant shoot the broad side of an elephant ab unfit gundogan and for having fernangoatindo starting from the bench your tactical briliance is undiniable and the sicological affect of switching tactics during game is why the 2021 champions league trophy is in the manchester city cabinet i am grateful that you tricked    Tuchel and english burnley  your name guardiola deserves to be edged in champipns league bottle job history 😥😥😥😫😫😫😰😰😰😰😭😭😭😭.
City should have won the game without a coach. Players just play by themselves the way has been playing the whole season.
Thomas tuchel has done an extraordinary job with Chelsea, a tactician master class. He do it against all odds. He deserves an honor of knighthood from her majesty. Well done Sir Thomas!
Fernandinho at CDM: I sleep Rodri at CDM: I sleep
werner may have missed chances but created space for the others. He was also key to our victory
Some excellent analysis there!
No DM and no wonder why through ball on the key for Havertz goals.
Kanté deserves Balon D'or. That's all I'm saying
Reese had sterling in his pocket Chilwell had mahrez in his pocket  Kante had the whole city squad, substitutes and fans in his pocket
I love Chelsea
🎶 N'Golo N'Golo KANTE! 🎶What a performance again!
Dude, this type analysis is exactly what i was looking for for learning.   One question, what software do you use to do the videos, do de arrows, cyrcles...??
City's comeback record is not good this season. Once they concede a goal or two, they never look like bouncing back and winning the game.
pep PEP’D himself. starting sterling, no fernandino or rodri and no cancelo were BIG mistakes
Tuchel's practical and effective tactics vs Pep's overthought messy plan...and Tuchel outwit Pep once again. Chelsea gonna rock this season in EPL. 👊👐
chelsea win
I don’t know why pep always screws up big games
Man city with their oil money they can't even win the champions League.  They can win domestically but on a continental level they disappoint a lot
I still can’t believe how shit we played; we literally gifted the match to Chelsea by inviting them to execute counter attacks
For me it's Kante and James best in the entire game James played it so good and neat and Kante was always there at the right time.Werner should be sent home back to his mama football isn't his calling.
Werner might have bad shooting but ONCE AGAIN hes the reason we won his runs helped havertz 3 players went to werner and havertz had a huge amount of space and clinically scored
From the day guardiola dont want to use classik striker i dont like him.he should have soares or kane or lewa.he must understand that in barca he had messi!thats why all was great.pep buy a scorer and you will win everything
Football made simple is dope, de breakdown of tactics is amazing and examples matched perfectly
💙💙💙
What are your thoughts on Pep's move to leave out Fernandinho and Rodri? Pundits are just calling it a mistake and say that he intended to play more offensively. However knowing Pep, I believe his thoughts were quite a bit deeper than this. He must have spotted something. But I struggle to understand the idea behind this move. Any thoughts?
Managers and formations don't win matches, players do. City's were found wanting, as usual.
It waz a combat field, and worsen final have ever seen.
That Rudiger tackle on foden was just beautiful *chef kiss
Thomas Tuchel take a page straight out of the Special One hand book Jose’ Mourinho parking the bus not pretty but efficient.
i am desapointed i supporte mahrez but the guardiola' plan is the fiction in the midle!!!!!!
Kante is currently the best footballer in the world
Great analysis ! Are you a coach ?
City had no Defensive midfielder to give shape and filter the passes necessary.City needs a striker as a reference point. They played possession football instead of going forward.
I love this sport ⚽️
P. Viera coming to announce his successor kante
Hazard and Courtois joined real to win trophies.Real got beaten by chelsea 3-1 on alg than chelsea proceeded to win the final
Even though I'm not from England I've been a Chelsea fan ever since I started watching football. No particular reason I just grew to love them. Unfortunately I was young when they got the first UCL and I wasn't watching much football. Now at 18 though, I get to celebrate and enjoy this well deserved trophy. Go Chelsea, go Blues!!! I'll stop by London and enjoy a game very soon.
“And Sterling could use his pace to get behind James, which happened once” ONCE IN 90! James put that man in his pocket
Pep gambled
you should make the #7 10x as big
Its the wrong chelsea lineup chelsea captain played at cb , 3 men at back.
Honestly Werner's pressence helps the team alot. His inclusion in the team is very much justified.. He takes out soo many players with his runs. The space for that Harvertz goal was all possible because of that run.  When he gets his confidence, he will be really lethal.
Pep : Overthinking everything. Tuchel : Counter, score, park the bus.
Jesus and Sterling are shit. They need to be sold now. Bring in better winger and striker. Harry Kane would be good for City or Haaland would be even perfect.
Simple, Tuchel stick to basic football which is playing a proper defensive midfielder and a striker. While Pep, taking out his DM in fernandinho and playing without a proper striker. Werner can harass Dias and Stones with his pace and he even manage to have a shot on city GK, on the other side City false 9 didn't even manage to trouble Azpi, Rudiger, Silva, Christensen and Mendy.
Tuchel outcoached Pep in this one...
Kante definition of Iron dome.
The 3-4-3 of Tuchel is a big problem for pep. Pep still does not find the answer.
Imagine makele  and kante playing side by side !!!!!
I remember it was the 4 4 2 formation , then it changed it was more physical , players getting faster it switched to 4 3 3 . Then after the 4 3 3 the game became more more defensive minded it became 4 2 3 1 . Then some coaches adopted the 3 4 3 formation guys like conte . 2 speedy rb and lb to counter the 2 speedy wingers !!! In the middle u put a defensive midfielder and makele and kante the 2 best at this position .
What did you make of the Kante Jeorginho defensive duo?
Are you South African?
Tuchel the best manager
Pep should  have played  rodri and fernandhino in midfielder.balance BTW attack and defence
pretty good analysis; keep up the great deep dive!  Just wanted to add that although this game was Man City vs Chelsea, it was obviously Pep vs. Tuchel. on a different scale, it was Sheik Mansour vs Abramovich.  I was wondering who most of Man U fans would be cheering for, what do you think ? Finally, where is Zidane going since he's left RM ?
A Messi-less Pep has won in Europe as much as Sean Dyche.
Let's say what ever tactics done by both Managers.... Chelsea Had More Younger Blood...
KANTE
It was all Ngolo Kante. Without him Man City would have won. And Pep would have been hailed instead.
I love seeing Pep lost, saved us from his fanboys noise pollution.
Kante often joined the front 3 to create 4v4 at times, with the fullbacks staying back !!  City were at times pressing too much, their players gave up their positions in order to press, that dissolved city’s tactical positioning!! Chelsea on the other hand did awesome zonal positioning and pressing !! leaving the least spaces for city !! Pep was somewhat outclassed last night !
Good analysis. Very different from most of what has been said and rightly so.
Pep thought outnumbering chelsea 3v2, 4v2 in the midfield would be great, But Kante had other ideas !! 😂
City fans show respect to Chelsea and stop making funny excuses.  They beat you in all three games damn it.  Acting like you know his squad then the man who built it. Smfh
Pep is overrated. All his career he managed a brilliant and rich club with great players like messi,Xavi,Iniesta,Puyol In bayern he had Lewandowski, Robben,ribbery, muller and in city he had money and he bought players of his desire.  He never managed a struggling club with budget issues. I m pretty sure he can't do it. Tuchel,Klopp,Zidane,Ancelotti .etc are better
😆👏👊👍💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💪👀
A eight plus video with siix adverts, are you sure you couldn't squeeze another few in?
Chelsea defeated man city's team A,B,C and now there aren't any more excuses. Pep was outclassed every time by Tuchel.
Hey bro  I remember one saying "attack wins you game but defense wins you titles".  Chelsea backline was rock solid . Mason mount is underrated that sensational through ball and havertz finishing it. Timo werner was threat to their backline with his runs.   Everyone were with man City side claiming that they will thrash us. We ain't gonna beat them. Chelsea defeated man city's team A,B,C and now there aren't any more excuses. Pep was outclassed every time by Tuchel.
I think Walker did many defensive mistakes..and some times with the ball he misses somany
Kante would be real Bad in playing the "Where's Waldo" game.
Pep is so kind.  He actually equalised Werner's inability to convert half chances with a  Raheem Sterling start,  forgetting that Werner even on a bad day will rip defenses apart with his runs.
The virgin communist guardiola vs the chad tuchel
Sterling was useless, alright if you're not in form, but you can at least try to be in position. Both offensively and defensively he didn't do his job
Second half was totally dominated by city
Zinchenko was totally asleep on the goal. Was jogging next to Havertz... City didnt deserve to win this, Pep wdid overthink again and cost them the final. The mistake wasnt only not playing a dm but also having Zinchenko in that diamond. They didnt move the ball quick enough the whole game and stopped pressing after 30 min

Pep made tactical mistake in the line up . They went for an attacking line up without Fernadinho and Rodri, but in second half when they have to score they forced to introduce two DM !!
I think pep wanted walker and zinchenko to play as CDMs in place of fernandinho. This may explain why walker and zinchenko never overlapped. Sterling and Mahrez were probably supposed to track the Chelsea fullbacks.
Tuchel 3-0 Pep
Coyb
Pep should had played rodri or fernandinho
Tuchel played 3 times against pep and tactically outclassed pep 3 times in a row
I said pep would possibly start sterling and I was spot on. but I felt it would be in place of bernardo silva. I didn't know who was going to go all out attacking. I don't like peps tactics because I don't ever rate him as a tactician but I think he got it spot on today. Sterling was right to have started. When they played Chelsea the last time, sterling was their best player and we discovered a new thing. The new thing was that sterling was the only Mancity player or player from any big team Chelsea had recently played to know how to run behind chelseas defence. Infact he troubled Chelseas defence in the first 15 minutes before Reece James learnt how to keep him at bay. And he still was their liveliest player as Mahrez, bernando, foden were almost completely missing
Where are the loud Manchester city fans now ?
🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵🔵Chelsea 🔵🔵🔵🔵
Stupid video.  Dont waste your time.  And how does City have an xG of .59 with one easy SOT in the 8th minute and that's it?
Can you please make how Klopp came 3rd with no senior CBs
The 5/3 back hybrid is the future of football tactics. Unstoppable if played in the right way
No CF and no DM, that is why Pep lost.
So Werners run disrupts 3 City players. How can pundits not give this credit to Werner? Notice how Werners run is slightly diagonal towards the left, stretching space between him and Havertz.
And who else noticed Mendy was wasting time even when the game was still 0:0?🤔
Well done Tuchel becoming only the 2nd manager to beat Pep in a cup final🙌💙
Legend has it that Google Earth is still trying to locate City's quadruple. Pep's 4 trophy quest single-handedly destroyed by one man...Tuchel.
Two former Paris SG managers winning the two European trophies. Looks like Pocchetino will be winning something soon. Once he leaves Paris.
Chilwell and James were just brilliant
I think rodri or fernandinho should have been used. Clearly our first two wins got into peps head. Remember the rodri error lead to chelsea 2nd goal in the pl match. Also sterling is not a good match against james. Tv showed pep using 442 formation. 2 strikers and one being sterling. I think pep could have used aguero as well.
Like koeman has grudge on riqui pep has on aguero
Mannnn kante is everywhere to pick the ball. He even pick my wife from the store while running
i think Pep was expecting Mahrez/Sterling to beat Chilwell/James a few more times which would drag Rudiger/Azpi out to make space for the centre, hence the city midfield selection. But Pep didn't know how good the Chelsea wingbacks were, Chilwell got super close to Mahrez, James used pace and recovery runs and Sterling barely had any joy, city had no outlets. Azpi's long ball to Werner was an obvious way to beat city high press, I struggle to understand why didn't Pep think of something to deal with it.
Pep over think again worried too much about the opposition  instead of concentrating on his team strengths and weakness.
I know the name is difficult but please: azpil iiii cueta
I've noticed both winners of the European league have won with a low block defensive line. A new era coming up?
I have a request🙏 to make to you FMS. Please make some tactical videos of EURO 2020 & COPA 2021 knockout phases. Especially teams like, Brazil🇧🇷 Argentina🇦🇷 Uruguay🇺🇾 France🇫🇷 Portugal🇵🇹 Belgium🇧🇪 England🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 Germany🇩🇪 ,& if possible more.
Pep should of lined up with Fernandinho or rodri at cdm....
Personally thinks that Reece was like leech to sterling n outclassed him and Rudriger / Chillwell cancelled out Mahrez/kevin threat that was setback to city, Pep had no answer to chelsea tactics
All of you criticising pep don't know it isn't easy to win a ucl
this game shows the importance of defensive midfielder in the game most underated position put some respect on busquets fernandinho fabinho etc
I think Pep's overthinking is Pep's greatest enemy
Total football has always been a failure, only reason why barcelona succeeded with it was because of their absolutely ridiculously good players during the late 2000s and early 2010s
I'm disappointed,Pep overthinking again,Sterling shouldn't have played he didn't play well at all ,Fernandinho should have started to help protect the defence and for those Tactical fouls.
RIP England for Euros they're gonna be starting with Rashford and sterling
At first glance of the formation of Man City, I thought to myself where's Fernandinho? Heck where's Rodri? And why the hell Sterling is here? They were completely dismantled by the defense of Chelsea, especially Kante who was everywhere like a 7-Eleven store. I don't think Pep overthinked, he was more of outplayed by Tuchel. Props to Chelsea for their win.
Pep be like my system work till FInal.  Let change the whole system and F up again in the most crucial stage again by removing my defensive midfielder and let Ma Man Sterling who never earn his place for Final or especially crucial stages, i will let him play.   The outcome was already decided when Sterling was in the line up.
Christensen has been criminally underated this season. Last night, he has stepped in for one of the most experienced and capable centre backs in world football, against the best team and best manager in the game at the moment ... And it was as if Silva never left.
Pep used 6 midfielders to coutre Kante, but Kante has big pockets
After the FA Cup final defeat, Tuchel made his team stay on the pitch and watch the Leicester celebrations. In the dressing room afterwards, he will have said to them: ''Do you want to feel like that after the Champions League final?'' In every way he won the mind games over Pep.
Aguero and Fernandinho absence leads to Chelsea win.... Aguero could have make a confusion amaong Chelsea defenders and Fernandinho could have taken care of mount and Kai... In my opinion kai played a loose game... It was kante because of him Chelsea won... Although I wanted pep to lose..
The lack of striker affected city. And he should have gone with 4231. Because of the speed of Werner. He needed to be a bit more defensive.
Chelsea didn’t mind leaving their flanks open for crossings since City had nobody to cross to. When Agüero and Jesús finally came in, Chelsea just sat deep and ran out the clock.
U might victimize tactics. But mahrez and sterling were nullified by brilliant duo of James and and chillwell there only odd time were they had any head start.otherwise most of the time in the back pocket. Werner miss the kick otherwise it could have been more humiliating for city.
A player like N golo Kante was the difference between the two teams... Fernandingho could have decreased that difference in the game had Pep brought him in the first 11...Also City not coming with a defense piercing forward like Werner in Chelsea also was an issue... Debruyne should have played more of a midfielder role in the game than Pep making him as a forward. Bringing in Both Aguero and Jesus in 2nd half showed City's desperation and struggle in forward attacking .Chelsea gave no room for error. Not just  Sterling, all City attack was out shown by Chelsea defense...

#FreeFreePalestine ❤️#FreeFreePalestine ❤️ 💚💚💚💚❤️❤️❤️❤️
Timo Werner attracting the defense towards him giving Mount plenty of space to give Havertz the ball to score. He isn't as useless as people claim him to be
Pep Tactic need super dribbler like Messy or Chiesa..
Gundogan is most effective when he's allowed to make late runs in the box. His combo play with Foden is superb. Maybe he should've been played in his natural position rather than Fernandinho's position. Plus when Sterling hasn't started for so long, why now? But Manchester City didn't do much wrong. Just Chelsea had good timing...
I really start to believing that Pep is crazy... why this line up?
Mistakes lost game
Man city were better side, it's sad that they didn't win
Chelsea jointly won this for Thiago Silva, Azpi,  Kante and TT for past efforts. Thank you guys for also doing it for us the fans. I'm elated
Very few actually appreciate werners contribution in this game. Yeah he might've missed the chance he had but his positioning and off-ball movement was so good. The havertz goal was possible thanks to his run dragging ruben dias along with him
Player so talented yet so clown.. sterling.. Zinchenko fucked up
All credits to tuchel and all of respect to the legendary kante What a game he had once again
Your analysis superb. Give analysis of National teams eg Brazil, argentina, france for copa and euro
Ya haven't a clue mate away back and watching cricket
Tuchel transformed Chelsea in blink of an eye😳
Messi, Iniesta and Xavi created Pep. Fraudiola is a league manager who always had the best squad in every league he played. Carabaos mean nothing. This shit manager is exposed every season in UCL and FA cup.   When Zlatan says "He is a coward". I believe in Zlatan. Pep was always responsible for losing so many cup matches because of his coward approach.
WTF is pep thinking ? seriously, is that so hard to field your strongest XI instead starting an out of form Sterling ?
Nice analysis
I wonder why Pep chose to make Mahrez cover rather than having Gündogan deal with the AMs or have him drop in between the CBs.    In short though. Chelsea outnumbered City in the places where it mattered most. In attack they stood five to four and in defense they just dropped deep and let the three defenders on the ball.
Arteta tactics😀
pep has met his match, tactically
Last 3 ucl champions - 3 german managers
Just imagine being on the PSG board right now 😂😂😂😂😂
What I don’t understand it the line-up. Why KDB as a striker? Why Gündogan as a 6?
I feel like Gundogan was at fault for the goal as well. He should've been close to Mount. What's he doing there marking noone? Fernandinho basically attached himself to Mount in the FA cup final
Chelsea were solid defensively
Tommy “genius” Tuchel 3-0 vs pep. Up the chels.. raise the trophy!!!!
If man city won this UCL im quite sure we wont buy harry kane.. but now seems like more reason to get him.. sterling needs to go, he has nothing more to offer better than gabriel jesus..
💙💙💙💙💙💙  Reece James & Chilwell defensive masterclass on the wings🥳🥳
Pep the idiot, kdb at striker??!  Pfff And starting sterling????  Lmao 😂  No wonder city lost
Tuchel watched Villareal vs United game and applied the same thing by Unai being compact in defense.His formation during defence was 523 with a compact midfield due to which City could not get areas to penetrate.
Everytime I watched this, I kept thinking of Utd. Lol
German Coaches are tactically the best  2019: Klopp 🏅🇩🇪 2020: Flick 🏅🇩🇪 2021: Tuchel 🏅🇩🇪  2022: Nagelsmann?
Aka how pep fucked it up and tuchel parking the bus
If Timo was clinical The game should have ended in first half , Timo got chance too score 3 or 4 in goal in that first half ..Man city are very lucky to go away with 1-0 lose
Your analysis is good
Sterling as a starter was the worst decision on that match

It was a brilliant performance from Tuchel and the entire chelsea squad. They defended really well against city and tried to hit them on the transition with direct balls towards their quick front players. Kante did well in disrupting the midfield, james and chilwell both played really well against sterling and mahrez. In my opinion Zinchenko was a fault for the 1st goal. He just let Havertz make a run on him goalside to be through. It was a briliant pass from mount but zinchenko could have done better in terms of his positioning and recovery. U can see it at full time when zinchenko broke down in tears. He knows he made a mistake there. Pulisic should have made it 2-0 as well on the counter attack. Overall it was a great and well deserved win for Tuchel and his team. He is 3 for 3 against Pep now. What an incredible achievement.
10 dislikers were obviously City fans
Ngolo ngolo Kante
Everybody is appreciating Kamte and rightfully so but Reece James put in a phenomenal performance
Peps overthinking👩🏿‍🦲
Pep : Who the fuck needs a DM if you meet a best counter attacking team in europe
Most stupid line up ever by Guardiola. Guardiola robbed of this victory from his players
Pep really needs a genuine forward. When aguero came on, at least there was shots on target. You wanna know what's ironic? Real madrid lost 3-1, but at least mamaged to have a goal pasy mendy, even when they lost 2-0, mendy worked way much more than vs city, while against city, mendy was basically a bystander
Peps 4-3-3 looked like Sarris with Gundo Playing the Jorginho role esp in the first half. 2nd half Pep Changed tactics, pushed Foden n Gundo higher they looked threatening but all this was because Chelsea had a basic but effective shape. Tuchel got in peps head for this one. Tuchel 3-0 Pep
I was waiting for this!
England shouldn't take starling
Fernandinho sud be at the 1st 11
Why no DM
Hi Welcome to final won simple
Great vid I was putting all the blame on zincheko but that pass was just perfect he had no chance.
Tuchel beat pep , at home, away and far away from home this season !
Fernandinho's absence was pivotal in the first half.there was nobody to deal with havertz and mount. It might have cost the match for pep.
aerial crosses with sterling & gundo at the helm ? good thinking senor pep.
The biggest mistake Pep did was not starting Rodri or Fernandinho and again Pep overthinked
Pep tried to playmore attackin squad thinking to outclass Chelsea...But it was a mistake playing Gundogan at the centre, De bruyne as a falae nine, Sterling wide while he has been so poor all season....He should have gone with Rodri or Fernandinho as anchor man...And benched Sterling and play Foden wide and De bruyne as CAM
😥 i juc cant...
It was a tough game... I was surprised Man City did not create more chances, very unlike them!
The formations for Manchester City were suitable to use, but there's wasn't a real Centre Defend Midfield (CDM) to work perfectly with 4-3-3 false 9 formations.
The biggest mistake was to play Sterling and leave Fernandinho on the bench....This pushed Gundogan into Fernandinho's position and made him useless in the entire game
Tuchel success means that a third time in row  a German manager is lifted the champions trophy
Tactics were not the thing that Made one lose & one win here . Starting Lineup wins you Matches & Later subs. One can check my previous comments on Pep on this channel & I think this will be the first time ever when I think He Messed up & Not players.  You can't Play de Bruyne without Rodri & Fernandinho & that Made the difference. Okay , you started Sterling but as you saw he's not hitting , sub him out.  Altho I'd still say Tactically No Manager won this Game because Both had chances & as I said these Matches aren't about Tactics , these are about Nerves , Luck , Chances that Goes in or a Very good Performance from One Man. One thing that I'd like to criticize further is first Half play Of City . They kept on going from Left side again & again while completely ignored Right side. They went for Reece James with Pace who's way way faster than Azpi .  Walker & Mahrez both have good Pace but none used it because Mid was too busy on the left side & I even saw Pep continuously swiming his arms to tell players that they need to move the ball Right Left but why were they not doing.  When I see such Games from Pep , for sure it makes me believe if he even wants to win Some Matches & he intentionally does this. playing Low would have made City winners today & I still Commend Dias , defence's not one Man job but as a whole.  Stones was off as well .
Pep really disrespected City players and fans. He should’ve at least apologized for underestimating Tuchel for the third time. Playing out of form Sterling and no CDM. I’m starting to think he’s a crackhead and we don’t really need him 🤦🏾‍♂️
This is what happens when either rodri or fernandinho played as DM for whole season and pep suddenly thinks gundogan is a perfect DM for final. Like what the hell?????
Pep: A CDM NO out of form Sterling  A Striker NO 4 wingers
How can an "Excellent" Manager LOSE to the same team, the same manager three times in a row in critical encounters?
Pound sterling at pocket Reece James❌ Raheem sterling at pocket Reece James ✔️
Honestly huuuge congrats to the Chelsea team and their fans, with the way you started the season so many rival fans (including me) bantered you lot and made fun of you, when tuchel came in I expected this squad to perform better but oh boy had I not imagined them winning the CL, props to Tuchel and his players. Chelsea fans this is your day and you lot deserve to be happy.
In the first half, when Raheem was one vs one with Mendy, I shouted 'it's Raheem, he'll mess up anyway'. I wasn't wrong 🤣
⚽️⚽️⚽️ Please do a video on how naglsmann can bring sucess to bayern Also please do a video on marsch leipzeig tactics how wll he try break bayern dominance  Also please do video on euro tactical preview
Guardiola lost the game he is the only responsible
Champions of Europe, at Munich and now Porto 🏆🏆😎 Firstly I'd like to wish Thiago Silva and KDB a speedy recovery 🙏  Secondly I'd like to congratulate every City supporter for winning the UCL in WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YT comments
Poor dele Alli His masterplan to get ucl medal from pep daughter is totally failure 😐😥😂
All that 💰 in the world and they still lost. 😂😂😂
Can't wait for Pep to drop 150 mil on Kane this summer, and then play him as LW.  Why? Because Kane is the tallest attacker they have. EVERYBODY knows that fullbacks are shorter than CBs. So if Kane starts at LW, he can win headers over the opposition RB and knock it down for Sterling at striker to have an easy tap in. GENIUS, GALAXY BRAIN PEP!
But why the heck did Pep played gundogan (as a dm) instead of fernandinho/rodri ??? That just doesn't make sense ... What gundo has to offer in that position that rodri / fernandinho can't offer ... Rodri is an excellent passer so ... And he should be knowing that hard working Chelsea midfield won't give acres of space for gundogan to exploit with his dribbling (the only thing ... I think rodri/fernandinho doesn't have )
Man City Fans: i want the trophy Pep: best i can do is Sterling as CDM
There’s no passion from Man City players (maybe except Mahrez and Walker), especially when pep ruins the perfect line-up in the FINAL
Who goes into a final without a striker
Pep really made a massive mistake not starting Fernandinho and playing Sterling
Fernandinho was necessary for a stable midfield and to free De Bruyne
Did anyone else notice that Chelsea's backline was broken couple of times with CB pushing up but no one made a run behind them & no one attempted a lofted pass to use that space, it was somehow all about going through the centre. (I may be wrong)
👍🏾
Why is nobody talking about Chilwell? He pocketed Mahrez and Walker throughout the game
I think Jesus should've started instead of Sterling, his pace behind the back 3 could've been a treat, also i dont know why Pep didnt use his fullbacks better in attack, Walker as a RCB and Zinchenko as a LCM was sorry, I bet they would've been way more usfeul overlapping their wingers
One rule: never underestimate Tuchel like that. And he redeem himself after he went through after he was let go by PSG. On the other hand Guardiola has no plan B at all how to break the deathlock of Chelsea. Tuchel is tactically better then Guardiola. More pragmatic.
Maybe Arteta should teach Pep on how to beat Tuchel
Fernandinho was so necessary
"Wisdom is not a product of schooling but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it."
Pep: “Ahh yes, an out of form Sterling is exactly what I need in the biggest game of the year.”
'Pep knows better than me' funny but true 😅
30ter!
What is kante doing in a striker position? Wait is that him in a center back position stoping a counter attack? Wait is that him at right back tackling the shit out of de bruyne? Like literally this guy is all over the pitch, and he's always in the right place right time. When he was in the middle of the pitch today, I notice city trying to go through the wings lol. Kante is immense for this team, I just wished he would stay young. He deserved a balon dor. If he doesn't win it its a shame.
Manchester City is champion on social media, Chelsea is champion on the field
<3
Pep the bald fraud
I feel like your videos would be better if you spoke over the screenshots of the game rather than what you’re doing right now. I still love your content though.
Tuchel : Simple tactics. Pep : I will overthink.
Actually, city played with a 4-3-1-2 with a diamond in the mildefied, and Chelsea played with a 5-4-1, with many triangles and fourgones
Both Sterling and Werner were looking Threat in this game. Their Pace And Workrate looks so dangerous except Finishing
At least Man City fans can shut the hell up about their A team. Tuchel has done Pep three times in a row.  Put some respect on his name.
Kanté was Brilliant in this game🔥. Superb Midfielder; He both Attack and Defend Well  Also Great Ball from Mount to Havertz!🔥 Which exposed City's Defence
I was patiently waiting for your analysis for this match. Great analysis as always
Tuchel needs a lifetime contract
I have one word for this match, KANTE. 👏👏
PSG must be regretting for sacking Tuchel. What a Manager! He is Pep's Nemesis. He beaten Pep's City 3 times this season👏👏👏
Awesome!!! Up Chelsea
I'm first hre
Pep Guardiola literally overthinked. why Foden in cm, Why sterling in squad
All I can say is pep did overthinked and was a bad decision not picking the line up he used against psg.
Tuchel's tactics work well with Kante
Kante mate! Humility, positivity that brightens up the whole field! Anyways intense match where I guess everyone thought city will have a clear win but who knows it's an intense match with favourites like KDB and Thiago Silva injured halfway. Lastly, HAIL TUCHEL, transformed a weak Chelsea side to one of the best in Europe and may win EPL next season :)
NIIIIIIIICEEEEEEEEEEEE
Marshmello put in a better performance then man city
